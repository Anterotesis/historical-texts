<BIBL>PSALM CXVIII. 9 V.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>IT is better to tru&s;t in the LORD than to put confidence in Princes.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF we do not think too highly of our&s;elves, but &s;oberly, as we ought to think, it is very well. We are certainly weak, indi|gent creatures. Indeed all men are, in &s;ome degree, con&s;cious of their own na|tural and unavoidable imperfection. Why el&s;e do they not tarry at home, glorying in their own &s;elf-&s;ufficiency; and take up &s;atisfied with what they find there, in&s;tead of wandring abroad to find &s;omething on which they may re&s;t &s;ecure; &s;omething in which they may <HI>be quiet from fear of evil,</HI> and <HI>in patience po&s;&s;e&s;s their &s;ouls?</HI> Is
<PB N="6" REF="006717_0004_1029ADE39704EDD8">
any man &s;o &s;atisfied with him&s;elf? Does any man feel &s;uch omnipotence within, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to make him &s;corn an alliance with every thing extrin&s;ic to him&s;elf, in order to his avoiding evil and pro|curing good? No: All, all with one con&s;ent, have recour&s;e to &s;ome foreign aid, to make up that deficiency which they find at home. They do not, indeed, all place their hope in the &s;ame objects; their expectations are variou&s;ly founded, &s;ome on one thing and &s;ome on another. <HI>Some Tru&s;t in-chariots, and &s;ome in hor&s;es;</HI> while others <HI>make gold their hope, and &s;ay unto the fine gold, Thou art my confidence.</HI> And as all feel a cer|tain internal want and poverty, which makes them go abroad to beg an alms, &s;o all actually find that which &s;erves to relieve them in &s;ome mea|&s;ure; to buoy up their &s;pirits, and to pre&s;erve them from that de&s;pondency into which they mu&s;t unavoidably be plunged, had they nothing to tru&s;t to but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT is beyond the de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;how what vain and &s;lender props tho&s;e are in ge|neral, on which the mo&s;t lean for &s;upport, and re&s;t to their <HI>weary</HI> and <HI>heavy laden</HI> minds; how weak; how in&s;ufficient they are for that purpo&s;e, while they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and how &s;oon they mu&s;t wholly fail. We are led more particularly to con&s;ider, how little rea&s;on there is for us to place
<PB N="7" REF="006717_0005_1029ADE6E7B1A6D0">
our tru&s;t even in the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Potentates</HI> of the earth, who have doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t natural claim to it of any thing in this world: And, at the &s;ame time, al&s;o to con&s;ider the rea&s;onablene&s;s of placing it in <HI>Almighty God,</HI> who is <HI>the confi|dence of the ends of the earth.</HI></P>
<P>IT is natural and, indeed, rea&s;onable for people to exerci&s;e &s;ome &s;ort and degree of dependence one upon another; upon per&s;ons in the &s;ame rank of life with them&s;elves; and to repo&s;e a mutual confidence in each others good offices. This is ju&s;t; becau&s;e a Man may not only be <HI>pro|fitable unto him&s;elf,</HI> as every one that is <HI>wi&s;e</HI> is; but his <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s may al&s;o profit the &s;on of man,</HI> and be in&s;trumental to the happine&s;s of o|thers, as well as to his own. This makes it rea&s;on|able for mankind in common to rely, in a certain mea&s;ure and proportion, one upon another. But neverthele&s;s, as we find it ob&s;erved in the ver&s;e immediately preceeding that which you heard me read, <HI>It is better to tru&s;t in the Lord, than to put confidence in</HI> man.</P>
<P>Moreover,</P>
<P>As it is natural and ju&s;t for men to place &s;ome hope in others, in per&s;ons in common life, their equals; &s;o it is &s;till more naturally and ju&s;t for them to put their tru&s;t in tho&s;e that are ex|alted
<PB N="8" REF="006717_0006_1029ADEA4AC51C50">
to &s;tations of power and dignity; in their kings and other civil rulers; in tho&s;e who have, or are like &s;oon to have, the admini&s;tration of the public affairs devolved upon them; in the good management of which, the welfare of every indi|vidual is more or le&s;s concerned. The&s;e per&s;ons, by how much greater their power and influence are, and their obligations &s;tronger, than tho&s;e of men acting in a private &s;tation; by &s;o much more are they the natural objects of our confidence. But &s;till <HI>it is better to tru&s;t in the Lord than to put confidence</HI> [even] <HI>in</HI> Princes. An inferior and &s;ubordinate tru&s;t may be fitly placed in tho&s;e who are called gods in this world; but the God of heaven, who&s;e mini&s;ters for good, who&s;e &s;er|vants and in&s;truments, they are, ought to be our fir&s;t and la&s;t re&s;ort; the &s;upreme object of our hope and dependence. This will equally appear, whether we con&s;ider the moral or the natural imperfections of the greate&s;t monarchs of this world, compar'd with the perfections of Him who&s;e <HI>throne is in the heavens,</HI> and who <HI>judgeth among the gods.</HI></P>
<P>TRUST in any per&s;on or being, if it be a rea|&s;onable tru&s;t, pre&s;uppo&s;es in him certain qualities and powers as the proper ground of it. Other|wi&s;e you are &s;en&s;ible it would be as rational to put our tru&s;t in the <HI>&s;erpent,</HI> as in Him that was to
<PB N="9" REF="006717_0007_1029ADEBCCA1EEB8">
<HI>brui&s;e his head;</HI> as proper to put confidence in a bear or a tyger; in an ape or a crocodile; or in the idols of the heathen, which are <HI>vanity</HI> and a <HI>lye;</HI> as in the living and true God.</P>
<P>THOSE qualities in any being, which are a ju&s;t foundation on which to build our hopes, are re|ducible to the heads of <HI>goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>pow|er.</HI> It is only an indigent creature, as was intima|ted before; one that &s;tands in need of &s;ome pro|tection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from without; one who&s;e a|bilities are not equal to his own wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s and nece&s;|&s;ities; it is only &s;uch an one, that is the &s;ubject of that affection which we expre&s;s by the terms tru&s;t, hope, confidence, and the like. It is incompatible to, and can take no place in, a being that is per|fect, &s;elf-&s;ufficient and independent. And as that affection of the human mind which is expre&s;&s;ed indifferently by tho&s;e &s;everal terms, pre&s;uppo&s;es a certain indigence and poverty of nature, from whence it ari&s;es, &s;o, when rightly fixed and ter|minated, it equally &s;uppo&s;es certain properties and affections in &s;ome other being, corre&s;ponding thereto; or a being that is fit to have confidence repo&s;ed in him: Who &s;urely can be no other than one who&s;e beneficent di&s;po&s;ition, who&s;e know|ledge and who&s;e abilities, may afford a &s;upply of that good and felicity, the ab&s;ence and de&s;ire of which, are implied in tru&s;t or hope. A being that
<PB N="10" REF="006717_0008_1029ADF0C552A7D8">
is aver&s;e to the doing of good to us, is certainly unfit to have confidence placed in him for what we want: &s;o al&s;o is one that either knows not our wants, or how to relive them: and he is equally &s;o, who is unable to do it; tho' he had both a di&s;po&s;ition for it, and knowledge &s;ufficient to di|rect his actions.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then, that the&s;e three things mu&s;t con|cur and unite, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree of them, in that being who is, in any mea&s;ure, a &s;utable object of human confidence. And from hence the conclu&s;ion &s;eems very obvious, That that being who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the&s;e qualities in the greate&s;t mea&s;ure, mu&s;t al&s;o be the highe&s;t object of tru&s;t. According to the proportion in which any one is inclined to befriend us; knows how to do it, and has ability for it; in the &s;ame proportion is our hope to be fixed on him. The mo&s;t perfect being, then, mu&s;t certainly be the fitte&s;t to be re|lied on, not only by us, but all other dependent creatures. And who this is, &s;urely no one in this a&s;&s;embly needs to be informed.</P>
<P>BUT if you plea&s;e, we will apply the general principle laid down above, a little more particu|larly to the point in hand, by &s;ome reflections on the apparent deficiency of all earthly princes and &s;overeigns, with relation to tho&s;e qualities which
<PB N="11" REF="006717_0009_1029ADF298E93668">
are the foundation of a rational tru&s;t; while God is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, in an unconfined, unlimited manner. The order in which they have already been mentioned, may po&s;&s;ibly &s;erve our purpo&s;e as well as any other. We will therefore keep to it; and, accordingly, being with <HI>goodne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>UNDER this term you will here under&s;tand the <HI>moral qualities</HI> in <HI>general;</HI> for, indeed, from this &s;ource they all flow; and in this they all termi|nate again; &s;ince <HI>he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law.</HI> Ju&s;tice and mercy; fidelity and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the like virtues, di&s;tingui&s;hed one from another by particular names; &s;eem only &s;o many different modifications and exertions of that one great principle of goodne&s;s, regulated, as to the exerci&s;e of it, by rea&s;on, or wi&s;dom. And it mu&s;t be acknowledged that many princes have been adorned with the&s;e moral excellencies in a great degree; &s;o that their own &s;ubjects, and for|eign &s;tates in league with them, might have con|&s;iderable dependence upon them; and indeed, have actually been happy under their &s;miles and patronage. Such glorious princes we our&s;elves have been ble&s;t with. But &s;urely it will be no re|flection upon the be&s;t of earthly &s;overeigns, to &s;ay that their goodne&s;s falls infinitely &s;hort of that of the Univer&s;al Sovereign; who is good to all; righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works;
<PB N="12" REF="006717_0010_1029ADF958F08968">
and all who&s;e &s;ubjects either have partaken, or do now actually partake, of his beneficence. For God is Love; and none ab&s;olutely good be&s;ides him. No earthly monarch is perfectly deve&s;ted of moral imperfections: And tho&s;e who have heretofore admini&s;tred public affairs with the great|e&s;t integrity and clemency, have neverthele&s;s de|viated from the rule of right in &s;ome in&s;tances, to the hurt of tho&s;e who confided in them. There are not wanting in&s;tances of tho&s;e, who, in the fir&s;t part of their reign, have ju&s;tly procured to them&s;elves univer&s;al love and re&s;pect; and yet have, long before the clo&s;e of it, &s;tained their hands, and royal character, with violence, oppre&s;&s;i|on and blood: Becoming the cur&s;e and &s;courges, in&s;tead of the guardians, of &s;uch as tru&s;ted in them. Even <HI>Nero</HI> was e&s;teemed a prince of great ju&s;tice and clemency, the former part of his time: But what was he afterwards? A royal mon&s;ter, and imperial butcher! The &s;ame is true of many others likewi&s;e. So that &s;ubjects can never have an ab&s;olute &s;ecurity, that even the be&s;t of kings will not alter their mea&s;ures; and op|pre&s;s and devour, in&s;tead of defending, them. They are as liable to fall, and <HI>turn away from their righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as other men. It is a great mi&s;take to imagine that any &s;tate of earthly power and greatne&s;s, can make a man <HI>independent;</HI> exalt him above the reach of temptation, or remove him be|yond
<PB N="13" REF="006717_0011_1029ADFADB4C1538">
a po&s;&s;iblity of doing the mo&s;t cruel, unju&s;t and &s;hameful things. As men ri&s;e to wealth and power and grandeur, their old pa&s;&s;ions often ri&s;e with them; or &s;ome new and unnatural ones &s;tart up in their brea&s;ts, to lead them a&s;tray. There are no bounds that can be &s;et to human folly and extravagance, any more than madne&s;s can be con|trolled and regulated by rea&s;on&mdash;No bounds &s;et, unle&s;s it be by Him, who &s;ays to the raging ocean, <Q>Thus far &s;halt thou come, and no farther; and here &s;hall thy proud waves be &s;tayed.</Q> Nor indeed does it appear (&s;urely not in this age of the world) but that tho&s;e who are fixed in the highe&s;t &s;eats of worldly power and magnificence, have &s;till their wants and cravings, of &s;ome &s;ort or other, as much as the vulgar; and can be in|duced to as great and &s;hameful wickedne&s;s. Any man may po&s;&s;ibly be <HI>drawn away of his own</HI> unnatural <HI>lu&s;ts and inticed,</HI> how much &s;oever he may be exalted above the re&s;t of the world: Whereas God, and He only, cannot be <HI>tempted with evil;</HI> becau&s;e it is He, and only He, that is truly and properly independent.</P>
<P>But if even the be&s;t of princes may not be ab|&s;olutely relied on, what will you think of the wor&s;t? or of tho&s;e that are no better than other people u&s;ually are? There are many princes in the world, or at lea&s;t there have been many, who
<PB N="14" REF="006717_0012_1029ADFCA577FEC8">
could not be tru&s;ted at all; perfidious, cruel, de&s;|potic and unrighteous men; who&s;e power has been employed for de&s;truction, and not for &s;alvation; for bringing mi&s;ery and ruin upon their &s;ubjects, in&s;tead of promoting the common felicity. You will all readily acknowledge that there have been &s;uch princes in the world. And do you ima|gine that our own nation has been wholly free from them formerly, as, God be thanked, it has been for &s;everal of the la&s;t reigns? Have there not been kings upon the throne of <HI>England,</HI> who have impiou&s;ly violated all their &s;olemn oaths and engagements to their people; as if they had &s;worn, only in order to &s;how how little they either feared God or regarded man?&mdash;Kings who have robbed their &s;ubjects of their rights and &s;ub&s;tance, by laying taxes upon them in an illegal manner?&mdash;Kings that have &s;et up the mo&s;t iniquitous and arbitrary courts?&mdash;Kings that have corrupted law|yers and judges, to uphold them and their crea|tures, in all their unrighteous and opp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="6 letters"> mea&s;ures?&mdash;Kings that have been the encouragers and patrons of per&s;ecution for religion?&mdash;Kings that were for taking away all our civil and &s;acred priviledges?&mdash;Kings that were for introducing popery and arbitrary rule among&s;t a free people&mdash;Kings that were for governing, not by fixed, &s;tanding laws, but &s;tanding armies?&mdash;Kings, un|der who&s;e admini&s;tration no man's con&s;cience, or

money, or life, could be &s;ecure a &s;ingle day?&mdash;Are the very names of CHARLES and JAMES forgotten!&mdash;Or do you not remember there was once a royal Hou&s;e of <HI>Stewart!</HI>&mdash;One might almo&s;t venture to a&s;&s;ert, that it were better to tru&s;t, not only in the Lord, but even in the <HI>Prince of the power of the air,</HI> than in &s;ome other princes who&s;e hi&s;tory we have read; and in whom &s;carce any one ever tru&s;ted, without being deceived and mocked and abu&s;ed; and having rea&s;on afterwards to be a&s;hamed of his confidence.</P>
<P>So that you &s;ee it is by no means &s;afe to place an intire tru&s;t in earthly princes; not even in the be&s;t, and much le&s;s in others. For <HI>men of high degree are</HI> often <HI>a lie,</HI> while <HI>men of low degree are vanity.</HI> Nor indeed are the <HI>latter</HI> ever more <HI>vanity,</HI> than in that blind and undue confidence which they often place in the <HI>former.</HI> But in God we may &s;ecurely confide. For he is immu|tably good and faithful. Tho' earthly thrones may be polluted and di&s;honoured with fal&s;hood and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; yet <HI>ju&s;tice and judgment are</HI> always <HI>the habitation of His: mercy and truth go before. His face.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if we could &s;uppo&s;e the goodne&s;s of princes to be perfect, like that of God, &s;o that we might always depend upon their be&s;t en|deavours
<PB N="16" REF="006717_0014_1029AE06C2592E58">
to &s;erve us; yet their wi&s;dom and &s;aga|city would not be equal to the goodne&s;s of their intentions. For which rea&s;on it would not be proper to place an unre&s;erved confidence in them. It is a very ancient ob&s;ervation, and &s;ufficiently verified by the experience of later times, that <HI>great men are not always wi&s;e.</HI> A king may be a <HI>child</HI> in more re&s;pects than one. Good &s;en&s;e is not en|tailed with the crown&punc; on the elder branch of the male line. Human laws cannot make wi&s;dom hereditary, tho' they may things of inferior value&mdash;thrones and &s;cepters. And what great degree of tru&s;t is there to be placed in a weak, &s;hort|&s;ighted prince, who&s;e head has nothing but a crown to <HI>adorn</HI> it? Be his intentions ever &s;o good, nothing con&s;iderable is to be hoped from him: and indeed he may probably de&s;troy, while he means to &s;ave. E&s;pecially &s;ince he is continual|ly expo&s;ed to be mi&s;led by crafty and de&s;igning courtiers, who will &s;tick at no mea&s;ures, however ruinous to the public, in order to advance their own power and fortune. By the&s;e he may be prompted to make fooli&s;h wars and fooli&s;h peaces with his neighbours, to the impoveri&s;hing and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing of his own &s;ubjects; and to the lo&s;s of many thou&s;ands of their lives: And in &s;hort, be led to do an hundred other things to the detri|ment of the public. Nor have there been wanting examples of whole nations brought to ruin, by well-meaning,
<PB N="17" REF="006717_0015_1029AE0845C5B110">
but impolitic, princes, under the influ|ence of wicked coun&s;els.</P>
<P>BUT let your prince be wi&s;e as well as good; what is human wi&s;dom at be&s;t, compared to that of <HI>the only wi&s;e God?</HI> All human policy and &s;a|gacity, are mere ignorance, if put in competition with His, who &s;ees all the connexions and depen|dencies of things, not only within the limits of one earthly empire, but thro' the empire of the uni|ver&s;e. The wi&s;e&s;t of kings might join with <HI>Da|vid</HI> in that humble acknowledgement&mdash;<HI>O God, thou knowe&s;t my fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;God taketh the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s: and whatever he purpo&s;es, with relation to the welfare, or the de&s;truction, of any nation, <HI>there is no wi&s;dom nor under&s;tand|ing nor coun&s;el again&s;t the Lord.</HI> So that his wi&s;|dom, no le&s;s than his goodne&s;s, may be &s;afely confided in; tho' the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t princes may mi&s;take in their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>IT will farther illu&s;trate and confirm the main point in view, if we con&s;ider to what a narrow &s;phere the power of the greate&s;t monarchs is con|fined: Whereas God's <HI>kingdom ruleth over all,</HI> and <HI>none can &s;tay his hand.</HI> Our &s;overeigns are, at be&s;t, but frail, weak creatures, being frequently unable to accompli&s;h their well-meant de&s;igns for their &s;ubjects; &s;o that <HI>the good which they would,
<PB N="18" REF="006717_0016_1029AE09C703B720">
they do not.</HI> They are not always able to pre&s;erve peace at home among&s;t their own people, or to protect them again&s;t the inva&s;ions and violence of foreign enemies. But all nations, before the Almighty, are as <HI>the &s;mall du&s;t of the ballance. He &s;tilleth the noi&s;e of the &s;eas, and the tumult of the people; and maketh wars to cea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are many great and national calamities, which no earthly potentates have ability either to prevent or to remedy. For tho' <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>where the word of a king is, there is power;</HI> this is far from being true without any re&s;triction. Will the king's word di&s;pel the tempe&s;t that hangs over us? Will it arre&s;t the thunder, and the lightning, anticipating the final conflagration, and &s;triking terror thro' a guilty world? Will the king's word &s;teady the earth when it trembles to its centre, threatning to &s;wallow up his towns and cities? What will the royal mandate &s;ignify again&s;t the murrain, the plague and the pe&s;tilence, laying wa&s;te his dominions? Will the&s;e obey his maje&s;ty's command, and &s;pare his &s;ubjects? Can the king call rain from heaven at his plea&s;ure, to refre&s;h the langui&s;hing earth? or keep his people alive in famine? Yea, do not contemptible in|&s;ects baffle his power and &s;overeignty? the locu&s;t and the caterpillar; and prove them&s;elves mightier than he? Whither then can we flee for &s;uccour,

under the&s;e and &s;uch-like di&s;tre&s;&s;es, but to that God who &s;ways an univer&s;al &s;cepter, and whom all things obey?</P>
<P>AMIDST the confu&s;ions and di&s;orders; the wars and tumults and mighty revolutions, of the world; the numerous calamities we are daily expo&s;ed to; it is manife&s;t that all human power is but a poor refuge.

And on whom &s;hall we rely for the &s;afe|ty of them? Can our kings forgive our &s;ins; and calm our troubled con&s;ciences? Can they pre|&s;erve us from the wrath to come? and be&s;tow upon us a ble&s;&s;ed immortality? How great &s;oever the power of our princes is, to &s;uccour and be|friend us, during this momentary life; yet &s;urely when this has a period put to it, their power over us al&s;o cea&s;es&punc; When our mortal cour&s;e is once fini&s;hed, <HI>they have no more that they can do,</HI> whether to harm or help us. As to what is to follow after we leave this world, our <HI>only</HI> depen|dence is to be placed where it ought principally to be placed at pre&s;ent; in that God who&s;e power extends to our immortal, no le&s;s than our mortal, part; and who can either <HI>de&s;troy both &s;oul and body in bell,</HI> or cau&s;e both to live and rejoice in heaven. God can be our &s;up|port and comfort, not only in the &s;un-&s;hine of

<P>NOR indeed can we be certain-of protection from our earthly &s;overeigns, even while we live, becau&s;e they them&s;elves may die before us. <HI>It is appointed unto</HI> kings and princes <HI>once to die,</HI> as well as to &s;laves and beggars. And what &s;ecure confi|dence can be repo&s;ed in tho&s;e, who will in a few days lo&s;e all the little power they have at pre&s;ent? Let your king be good; let him be wi&s;e; let him be great and powerful; the life of this earth|ly god is as precarious as that of men. The rulers and potentates of the world, are not com|monly ble&s;t with firmer nerves and &s;inews, and more robu&s;t con&s;titutions, than the meane&s;t of their &s;ubjects. They wither away, and fall with years, as others do; unle&s;s, perhaps, they find a premature death. A dagger, or a cannon-ball, or poi&s;on, is as fatal to the prince as the pea&s;ant. The lives of the great, are in continual jeopardy, either from &s;ecret treachery, or open violence. Sickne&s;s does not reverence the head that wears a crown, any more than one which has not &s;o much as a cowl, or a cap to cover it. Death enters the royal court, as boldly as the cottage; the

palace, as the pri&s;on. Too many of the rulers of the earth, are indeed apt to forget, in the great|ne&s;s of their pomp and power, and while they are giving law to others, that them&s;elves are &s;ub|ject to the great law of mortality. But &s;earch the tombs and monuments of the dead, and you will find royal du&s;t and a&s;hes and bones, as well as beggarly. And he that was, perhaps, once the terror of one half the world, and the hope and confidence of the other, is long &s;ince become the prey of virmin.

<P>HIS attendance upon the wor&s;hip of God was both more con&s;tant and more devout, than that of princes and courtiers u&s;ually is.

<P>HE was a zealous promoter of liberal arts and ingenuous learning in the nation; not chu&s;ing, as &s;ome politicians have done, to rule over fools and brutes, but wi&s;e men&mdash;A great encourager of hu&s;bandry, manufactures and commerce; (the true &s;ources of national wealth and felicity:) And of all other de&s;igns in which he apprehended the public intere&s;t was concerned; of which he was doubtle&s;s among the be&s;t judges.

To which, indeed, one may &s;ay with mode&s;ty, it had not a le&s;s ju&s;t claim, than any other remote part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions whatever; whether in re&s;pect of its &s;tedfa&s;t loyalty to the illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover;</HI> or its beneficial &s;ervices to the crown and nation; the real intere&s;ts of which, 'tis to be hoped, will never be thought &s;eparate, but the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE Prince's conduct in dome&s;tic life; his ten|derne&s;s and fidelity to his mo&s;t excellent Prince&s;s; his paternal care and affection; his good oecono|my, and every thing he did within the walls of the palace, &s;hew'd the good and noble, the gene|rous and princely mind. This they did no le&s;s than that part of his conduct which fell under more general ob&s;ervation. And indeed every man's true temper and character are much better di&s;cerned, by his behaviour in common and private life, than in public; wherein goodne&s;s is more frequently aped and counterfeited, than really practi&s;ed. Con&s;ider'd in this view, the Prince al|ways di&s;cover'd the humane and ju&s;t, the well-natur'd and courteous man: which he did with|out degrading him&s;elf in the eyes of tho&s;e about him, or forgetting that he was born to wear a crown, And had he lived to this, there is no rea&s;on to doubt but tho&s;e virtues which appear'd &s;o amiable, and &s;hone &s;o bright, in a narrower

&s;phere, diffu&s;ing joy thro' his palace, would have been drawn forth into more public view, and exer|ted from the throne with peculiar advantage; to the joy and felicity of his <HI>greater family,</HI> the people of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI> All of them, I mean, except tho&s;e <HI>&s;trange</HI> men, who had rather be ruled by a <HI>papi&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Italian tyrant,</HI> than a <HI>prote&s;tant Prince,</HI> under the re&s;triction of &s;alutary <HI>laws.</HI></P>
<P>AND this leads me to ob&s;erve, that the Prince had a due abhorrence of popery and arbitrary government, as being both of them contrary to rea&s;on and chri&s;tianity; incon&s;i&s;tent with the na|tural rights of mankind, and the true&s;t happine&s;s of human &s;ociety. His own good &s;en&s;e doubtle&s;s &s;ugge&s;ted to him the impiety of &s;uch a religion; the inju&s;tice of this &s;ort of government; and at|tached him firmly to the <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> intere&s;t, and a limited monarchy; &s;uch as our own. But it is not improbable that he was the more e&s;tabli&s;hed in the&s;e glorious principles of a free government and free religion, by reflecting upon his di&s;cent; which was from an illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, the Patrons and Bulwark of <HI>Liberty,</HI> from the very beginning of the reformation. Which reformation the prince him&s;elf was, indeed, de&s;irous of &s;eeing carried in|to greater perfection, and brought nearer to the primitive and chri&s;tian model; e&s;pecially in <HI>Eng|land.</HI> For it is &s;aid He was a great promoter of
<PB N="30" REF="006717_0028_1029AE340C260028">
that late, important propo&s;al for a <HI>Review;</HI> in order to the altering and amending of tho&s;e nu|merous things in the national church, which have been &s;o long grievous, not only to <HI>non-conformi&s;ts,</HI> but al&s;o to great numbers of the <HI>be&s;t</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> men of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion.</P>
<P>THE Prince's charitable donations towards the relief of the poor and &s;ick; towards propagating chri&s;tianity in the world; and upon other occa|&s;ions, were many and liberal; &s;uch as become a prince. And we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that he was not a chri&s;tian in name only, but in temper; having that divine principle in him, which <HI>worketh by love</HI> and good deeds; and forms the manners.</P>
<P>I Do not remember that His Royal Highne&s;s had ever an opportunity afforded him, to di&s;cover his military virtue.&mdash;However we know he di&s;|cover'd a much more excellent &s;ort of heroi&s;m, than that which is &s;hown in fields of battle, and the greate&s;t martial atchievements.

we are under his almighty care and guardian&s;hip, we need not de&s;pair of having all our rea|&s;onable wants &s;upplied; or of e&s;caping tho&s;e very evils, of which &s;urely we have &s;ome rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive, with relation to the untimely death of this good Prince. Nothing is to be de&s;paired of, that is truly good and proper for us, while infinite wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s govern. The world, depend upon it, the world will never &s;uffer &s;hipwreck, and be wholly ca&s;t away, if God is plea&s;ed to take the helm, to &s;teer and con|duct it; tho' all other pilots of the &s;tate &s;hould be wa&s;hed over-board, and drown'd. So that even in the mo&s;t dangerous and tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;ons, we are not without con&s;olation: We know where to take harbor and &s;anctuary, from <HI>the &s;tormy wind and tempe&s;t;</HI> where to ca&s;t the anchor of our hope, <HI>till the &s;ore calamities are over-pa&s;t.</HI> Whoever dies, God &s;urvives; with whom we may <HI>acquaint our&s;elves; and be at peace.</HI> He lives and reigns <HI>the King eternal and immortal,</HI> tho' <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> to mortal &s;ight; and <HI>only wi&s;e</HI> al&s;o, tho' human folly does not di&s;cern the wi&s;dom of his conduct. Wherefore, while <HI>the Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of the i&s;les be glad thereof&mdash;Make a joyful noi&s;e unto the Lord, all ye lands&mdash;For the Lord is good, his mercy is everla&s;ting, and his truth to all generations&mdash;Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help; and

who&s;e hope is in the Lord his God, which made heaven and earth; the &s;ea, and all that is therein.</HI></P>
<P>BUT you will remember that this is &s;uch an happine&s;s as none can be intitled to, but tho&s;e who love and obey the God in whom they tru&s;t. It is a &s;oleci&s;m and contradiction for any to pretend to a pious confidence in God, and to &s;olace them|&s;elves in contemplating his power and providence&punc; while they live in wilful rebellion again&s;t him; while they abu&s;e his mercy, de&s;pi&s;e his ju&s;tice, and &s;corn his thunder. If we would exerci&s;e a rational tru&s;t in God, and enjoy the happine&s;s naturally re&s;ulting therefrom, we mu&s;t be reconciled to him thro' the great Mediator betwixt Him and man; and obey his holy commandments. Other|wi&s;e the divine wi&s;dom and power, and even good|ne&s;s, are rather a ju&s;t ground of terror, than of con&s;olation, to us&punc; For <HI>there is no peace, faith my God, to the wicked.</HI></P>
<P>THE great and &s;orrowful event we have been con&s;idering, may al&s;o &s;erve as a warning to all per&s;ons, exalted to power and dignity in the world, not to grow vain and imperious; not to plume them&s;elves upon their grandeur, and &s;uperiority over others: But to remember that <HI>they</HI> are al&s;o <HI>once to die,</HI> &s;ooner or later; and to give an account of them&s;elves to Him, who <HI>regardeth not the per|&s;ons
<PB N="37" REF="006717_0035_1029AE4B4513C248">
of princes;</HI>&mdash;to give an account, to what u&s;e they have applied their wealth and &s;uperior talents; whether to the glorifying of Him that gave them, and the good of their fellow-men; or to the di&s;|honoring of the One, and the injury and oppre&s;&s;i|on of the other&mdash;Alas! how many are there, with re&s;pect to whom this will be a mo&s;t awful and terrible reckoning.&mdash;</P>
<P>THERE is, as there ought to be, a wide diffe|rence of rank and circum&s;tance among&s;t mankind; in this world: But in the other, and before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, where all nations are to be gathered, the&s;e temporary di&s;tinctions will be all laid a&s;ide. In that va&s;t multitude, <HI>which no man can number,</HI> there will be no di&s;tinctions of high and low, rich and poor, bond and free; there will be neither prince nor &s;ubject; emperor nor &s;lave. You will &s;ee none in purple robes, with crowns and &s;cepters and diadems; none in chains and &s;hackles; but all, common men, the &s;inful po&s;terity of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> waiting their final &s;en|tence from <HI>the Judge of all the earth:</HI> Who will <HI>do right,</HI> rendering to every one, not according to his former rank and &s;tation in the world, but <HI>according as his work has been.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we behold the princes and &s;overeigns of the world, daily doing homage to the <HI>king of

terrors;</HI> ca&s;ting down their crowns at his feet, and leaving all their royal pomp and honors in the du&s;t; this &s;urely admoni&s;hes us to guard again&s;t pride and in&s;olence; again&s;t valuing our&s;elves upon tho&s;e little advantages and di&s;tinctions which we are &s;o prone to over-rate, and &s;et a greater price upon than they de&s;erve. 'Tis a &s;olemn lec|ture again&s;t that vanity; again&s;t tho&s;e &s;welling thoughts; again&s;t tho&s;e towering imaginations, which are but too common in per&s;ons of wealth and power; of figure and di&s;tinction in the world. It bids them remember, that how high &s;oever they are&punc; yea, tho&punc; they <HI>exalt them&s;elves as the eagle,</HI> and <HI>build their ne&s;t among the &s;tars;</HI> yet there is a God above who is able to bring them down; and to aba&s;e tho&s;e that walk in pride: A God, <HI>in who&s;e hand their breath is, and who&s;e are all their ways.</HI></P>
<P>MANY per&s;ons, when rai&s;ed to great wealth and dignity, have been ready enough to flatter them|&s;elves, and have actually been flattered by others, that they were not &s;ubject to death, like the vul|gar &s;ort. But alas! the&s;e <HI>immortal</HI> Mortals are, neverthele&s;s, long &s;ince <HI>dead,</HI> and become the &s;port of voracious in&s;ects! This al&s;o will be &s;oon thy lot, O man! who&s;oever thou art, that now exalte&s;t thy&s;elf, and <HI>denie&s;t the God that is above. After thy &s;kin, worms will de&s;troy thy fle&s;h,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and rioting on thee for a while, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

them&s;elves. Yet there is after this, another worm; one that <HI>dieth not;</HI> and a <HI>&s;econd</HI> death, far more terrible than the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> Wilt thou not then, O vain and thoughtle&s;s Mortal, for&s;ake thy folly, till it is too late to be wi&s;e? In &s;ea&s;on con&s;i|der thy latter end,&mdash;what thou art coming to; nor put far away from thee the evil day. For behold, <Q>All fle&s;h is gra&s;s, and all the goodline&s;s thereof is as the flower of the field; the gra&s;s withereth; the flower fadeth. Surely the people is gra&s;s.</Q> Neither wi&s;dom nor power; neither &s;plendor nor wealth, will rever&s;e that &s;entence&mdash;<Q>Du&s;t thou art; and unto du&s;t &s;halt thou return.</Q> To u&s;e the words of the prophet, therefore, or rather of God him&s;elf; <Q>Let not the wi&s;e man glory in his wi&s;dom; neither let the mighty man glory in his might; let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he under&s;tandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which execute loving-kindne&s;s, judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth.</Q></P>
