<HEAD>A PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS 'tis Man's <HI>Sin, Shame</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> to be e&s;trang'd and alienated from God; &s;o it's his <HI>duty, honour</HI> and <HI>intere&s;t</HI> to return to God, be acquainted with Him, conform'd to His Image and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of His &s;pecial favour in Chri&s;t. Men con&s;ider'd as Fallen &amp; Apo&s;tate (as they derive from rebellious Adam) are running away from God, and po&s;ting on in the broad way to de&s;truction; but the Son of God was manife&s;ted to de&s;troy the works of the Devil, to reduce &s;inful Men, and bring them back to the only Author of their being and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. He &s;uffered, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, <HI>that He might bring us to God. He gave him&s;elf for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify us to Him&s;elf for a peculiar People zea|lous of good works.</HI> And His <HI>Holy Word,</HI> the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> are the grand Means or <HI>In&s;trument</HI> of <HI>purifying</HI> Sinners: they're able to make Men wi&s;e to Salvation, thro' Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. The Scope and tendency of them is, to turn Men from darkne&s;s to light, from the power of Satan

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Divinely In&s;pired <HI>Author</HI> of this long and copious P&s;alm was doubtle&s;s King <HI>David,</HI> the &s;weet Singer of I&s;rael; The <HI>Matter</HI> of it is of the highe&s;t impor|tance; the <HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> of it is mo&s;t accurate and artificial; The <HI>Scope</HI> and De&s;ign of it is to adorn the Character, and celebrate the Glories of God's <HI>Word,</HI> to declare the P&s;almi&s;ts own great &amp; long Experience of the admirable &s;weetne&s;s, and u&s;e|fulne&s;s of it, and to recommend it to every ones devout &s;tudy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ief, &amp; practical ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002024_0009_0FBA81201BDA4F60">IN our <HI>Text,</HI> The Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God is pre&s;crib'd and commended to <HI>Young Men,</HI> as the Rule and Means of Spiritual Purification. <HI>Wherewith &s;hall a Young Man</HI> &amp;c. This is call'd by &s;ome, <HI>The Young Man's Practical Catechi&s;m,</HI> &s;et down by way of Que&s;tion and An&s;wer. Others indeed take the whole Ver&s;e to be <HI>one intire</HI> Que&s;tion, &s;tanding thus, <HI>Where|with &s;hall a Young Man clean&s;e his way, to take heed to thy Word?</HI> The Original will admit this Con|&s;truction, and &s;ome Ancient Ver&s;ions (as Mr. <HI>Shower</HI> on our Text ob&s;erves) do countenance it. The &s;en&s;e (&s;ays He) accordingly is, "How &s;hall Young Men be purged by Divine Grace, &s;o as thereby to be qualify'd for Obedience to (the Word of) God. It is a kind of Prayer (in a Poetic &s;train) for that Grace, which is nece&s;&s;ary to holy walking." So <HI>Clean&s;ing the Way of Youth</HI> is con&s;idered as a <HI>Means</HI> to promote their practical <HI>conformity</HI> to God's holy <HI>Law.</HI> P&s;al. 119.101. <HI>I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</HI></P>
<P>BUT mo&s;t Interpreters under&s;tand the latter Clau&s;e to be <HI>di&s;tinct,</HI> and to come in by way of <HI>Reply</HI> to the former; &s;o directing Youth to a careful ob&s;ervation of God's Word, as a nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful means to rectify and clean&s;e their way. P&s;al, 119.11. <HI>Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not &s;in again&s;t thee.</HI></P>
<P>WE may here ob&s;erve, that the Word [<HI>thereto</HI>] is not in the <HI>Original,</HI> but is a <HI>Suppletive</HI> of the <HI>Tran&s;lators,</HI> and I &s;hall pre&s;ume to leave it out.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Terms</HI> in the Text are all obvious and ea&s;y.

<P>BY [<HI>clean&s;ing his way</HI>] is meant a rectifying his inward Principles and temper of mind, and a reforming his outward practice and tenor of Life, which are defiled by Sin; a recovering him&s;elf and clean&s;ing his way from moral pollution, a breaking off from Sin, the <HI>unclean thing, which de|fileth a Man,</HI> a wa&s;hing off this filth with the Tears of Repentance; purifying his Soul in obey|ing the Truth. There is indeed another <HI>Purging our Sins,</HI> which &s;ounds the &s;ame with <HI>Pardon</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tification, He is faithful to forgive us our Sins and to clean&s;e us, &amp;c. The Blood of Chri&s;t clean&s;eth from all Sin.</HI> But this belongs wholly unto God, <HI>(Who can forgive Sins, &s;ave God only?)</HI> and is not the Clean&s;ing intended in our Text. The Clean|&s;ing here &s;poken of relates to the work of <HI>Sancti|fication,</HI> and implies <HI>the Mortification of our La&s;ts, and the Reformation of our Lives.</HI> In this work <HI>we</HI> are &s;ubordinate <HI>Agents,</HI> working together with God and in the &s;trength of his Grace.

<P>NOW the Foundation of this deplorable Change in Mans Nature was laid in the fir&s;t and grand Apo&s;tacy.

This is as impo&s;&s;ible, as to gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thi&s;tles. <HI>A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruits,</HI> Mat. 7.18. <HI>What&s;oever is born of the fle&s;h, is fle&s;h,</HI> Joh. 3.6. Corruption and carnality is fa&s;t rooted and woven into the very Being of Man, and toge|ther with that de&s;cends to us by natural con&s;e|quence&punc; and nece&s;&s;ary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. We are born of the fle&s;h, and of the fle&s;h we reap corruption. With our natural Body, we receive from our Parents the Body of Sin and Death. Original Corruption is called the <HI>Body</HI> of Sin, becau&s;e 'tis derived with our <HI>Bodies</HI> to us, and chiefly reigns in the members of the Body; and it is termed <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> partly, and principally becau&s;e it is convey'd by <HI>carnal</HI> propagation. It is called the <HI>Old-Man,</HI> becau&s;e 'tis primitively deriv'd from Adam, the <HI>Fir&s;t Man,</HI> and in the way of natural Generation devolves even upon late&s;t Po&s;terity.

<P>AGAIN, <HI>Adam</HI> was the <HI>Moral Head</HI> of all Man|kind, de&s;cending from him by ordinary Genera|tion. He was our common Proxy or Deputy, and had a power to chu&s;e &amp; act, not only for him&s;elf, but for his univer&s;al Progeny. All Mankind were radically in him as their natural Original, and virtually in him as their Surety, Surrogate, or Vicegerent; By him they were all to &s;tand, or in him to fall.</P>
<P>HERE we mu&s;t note, that <HI>Adam</HI> tho' created in a &s;tate of <HI>Innocency,</HI> yet was not fixed in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute <HI>impeccability.</HI> Tho' perfect Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s was a <HI>natural</HI> and concreate excellency, and he had an innate power nece&s;&s;arily con&s;equent upon his primitive con&s;titution, as well as &s;uperna|tural ability to have perform'd compleat obe|dience, and have prevented his Apo&s;tacy, yet it was &s;uch as properly belong'd to a rational free Agent, in a &s;tate of probation, and was no ways,

incon&s;i&s;tent with that moral freedom of will, which put him into a &s;tate of mutability, and ex|po&s;ed him to the efficacy of &s;inful temptations, and render'd him capable of rewards &amp; puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>AND accordingly it plea&s;ed God to treat him, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> in a <HI>Faederal</HI> way; entering into a Co|venant with Adam, as &s;tanding in a publick capacity and per&s;onating all his De&s;cendents, wherein He promi&s;ed Life, and threatned Death. And be&s;ides the invariable <HI>moral</HI> Law, internal and &s;ubjective to his rea&s;onable nature, it plea&s;ed God to make trial of Adams obedience by a par|ticular <HI>po&s;itive</HI> external Prohibition, in a matter of pure indifference antecedently to the Divine Precept, but becoming obligatory meerly by the will of the Lawgiver. This prohibition was, that he &s;hou'd <HI>not eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</HI> Gen. 2.16. And this &s;pecial Command was of the &s;ame obligation, &amp; guarded with the &s;ame Sanctions, as the Eternal Law of Creation. The <HI>giving</HI> of it, was a mark of <HI>Sovereign</HI> Dominion, and the <HI>ob&s;erving</HI> of it would have been a rea&s;onable Service, &amp; mo&s;t <HI>refin'd</HI> obedience.</P>
<P>BUT Adam (to the ju&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment of Heaven and Earth) thro' unaccountable carele&s;ne&s;s was decoy'd by the in&s;inuating Tempter into rebellion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ruin. Being drawn by Satans Lures, he &s;trangely revolted from God, leap'd the boundaries of the Divine Law, and brake thro' all re&s;traints and pre&s;ervatives, and did voluntarily eat of the forbidden Fruit. Now this rebellious tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in its nature contain'd a violation of the whole Law, an entire renunciation of God, &amp; embracing the Creature as the chief Good, and Satan as the be&s;t Ma&s;ter. Hence the habit of Original righte|ou&s;ne&s;s

was lo&s;t, &amp; all moral excellencies effaced and extingui&s;ht, and an univer&s;al permanent corruption and foul deformity introduced, by a judicial act of God as a part of the Cur&s;e, and puni&s;hment of the fir&s;t Sin. And now this Ori|ginal corruption and degeneracy, con&s;ider'd as a puni&s;hment, is <HI>meritoriou&s;ly</HI> derived from Adam, and "falls under the ordination of divine Ju&s;tice". It is not only a fatal Legacy left us by our Fir&s;t Parents, but a <HI>Divine Cur&s;e</HI> entailed upon us. All Mankind were legally Parties in the faederal tran&s;action with Adam in innocency, and were under&s;tood to be virtually Accomplices in his Rebellion; hence his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was not ap|propriate and meerly per&s;onal, but a common Guilt, a Sin of the whole Nature and univer&s;al Race; And the Puni&s;hment has a proportionable extent and adaquate comprehen&s;ion. Hence <HI>Spiritual Death</HI> which is one part of the Cur&s;e, and the wages of Sin, is the unavoidable Lot of all the Children of Adam, thro' the righteous Judgment of God. Our Fir&s;t Parents &s;inned and are not, and we have born their iniquity; God vi&s;its the iniquity of the Father upon the Children from Generation to Generation. All the unhappy De&s;cendents of Adam do ta&s;te the &s;owre fruits of his Apo&s;tacy, and inherit the foul impurity of his Nature; and that <HI>ju&s;tly,</HI> without any breach upon the Laws of common Equity: For, That which is allowable and unrebukable in the Gods of the Earth, is much more &s;o in the Great GOD of Heaven, who&s;e Kingdom ruleth over all, and a Scepter of righteou&s;ne&s;s is the Scepter of His Kingdom. There can be no colour of pretence to impeach the Government of Inju&s;tice barely

for permitting Children to &s;uffer &s;uch Evils, as are but the puni&s;hment of their Fathers Sins, wi&s;ely and ju&s;tly allotted to them by the Laws, which they are &s;ubject unto. The Publick Authority is not &s;atisfy'd (for in&s;tance) with the puni&s;hment of <HI>Trea&s;on</HI> in the &s;ingle Per&s;on of the Rebel alone, but his E&s;tate is confi&s;cated, his Dignities forfeited, his Blood &s;tain'd, and nothing but ignominy and poverty de&s;cends to the uncon|&s;enting Heirs, by virtue of &s;ome humane Con&s;ti|tution. And after this, what can we object, what room have we to di&s;pute the Divine Ju&s;tice in the communication of Original Sin, to the Po&s;terity of Adam, &s;ince they, being in his Loins as their Parent, and in his Covenant as their Repre&s;en|tative, are intere&s;ted in the guilt of his fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion? Being thus <HI>entitul'd</HI> to the Penalty, it is <HI>ju&s;tly inflicted</HI> upon them.

<P>AND <HI>above all,</HI> We &s;hou'd &s;ee to it that the <HI>Spring</HI> of all be Clean&s;ed, that we get a <HI>clean heart</HI> and a <HI>right &s;pirit</HI> renewed within us.

<P>QUES. II. <HI>WHY</HI> do's it concern Men <HI>in their Youth</HI> thus to Clean&s;e their Way? To clear this Head, let us con&s;ider the following Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I. Con&s;ider, THAT <HI>Clean&s;ing our Way is a Work of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity and everla&s;ting con&s;e|quence.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our acceptance with God here, and enjoyment of God hereafter.
<PB N="21" REF="002024_0028_0FBA814DB78CB400">
There is a firm and indi&s;&s;oluble connection be|tween Holine&s;s and true Happine&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts in the favour &amp; fruition of God, the Chief Good.</P>
<P N="1">(1) THERE is a <HI>Legal</HI> Nece&s;&s;ity of Clean&s;ing our Ways. A Nece&s;&s;ity from the indi&s;pen&s;able obligation of a Divine <HI>Precept,</HI> and the inviola|ble con&s;titution of the <HI>New Covenant. This is the will of God, even our Sanctification; God hath not called us unto uncleanne&s;s, but unto holine&s;s,</HI> (1 The&s;. 4.3, 7.)

<P>Again, (2.) THERE is a <HI>Moral</HI> Nece&s;&s;ity. A Nece&s;&s;ity from the Nature and Rea&s;on of the thing. The <HI>Unclean Sinner</HI> (while &s;uch) is ab|&s;olutely <HI>unfit</HI> for the Divine Favour, and utterly <HI>uncapable</HI> of Divine Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. <HI>What fellow&s;hip can righteou&s;ne&s;s have with unrighteou&s;ne&s;s? What communion hath light with darkne&s;s? And what concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial?</HI> (2 Cor. 6.14.) The happine&s;s of Man lies in communion with God, and the enjoyment of Him.

"The work of Redemption is not engraven on the work of Creation, nor of Providence". Apo&s;tate Man's <HI>Salvation</HI> is not a Thing nece&s;&s;a|rily inferr'd from the Being and general Good|ne&s;s of God, <HI>of which He never left Him&s;elf with|out witne&s;s.</HI> (Act. 14.17.)

<P N="2">2. IT directs our feet into <HI>the Way of Holine&s;s.</HI> The Word de&s;cribes to us the <HI>good old Way,</HI> the <HI>way to Zion,</HI> and <HI>directs all our steps.</HI> Here is a &s;ufficient directory for the whole Duty of Man. It propounds the right <HI>Principles,</HI> exact <HI>Mea|&s;ures,</HI> and true <HI>Ends</HI> of Obedience.</P>
<P>GOOD <HI>Principles</HI> are e&s;&s;ential to pure Reli|gion; &s;uch as <HI>Faith</HI> in Chri&s;t, the <HI>Fear</HI> &amp; <HI>Love</HI> of God, <HI>Hope</HI> in His Mercy, &amp;c. The&s;e are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce&s;&s;ary Ingredients of &s;incere Goodne&s;s, pre&s;cribed in the <HI>Word of God</HI>; concerning &s;ome of which the <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> of old knew nothing, and of the others they took but little notice.</P>
<P><HI>WITHOUT Faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God,</HI> (Heb. 11.6.) <HI>What&s;oever is not of Faith is Sin,</HI> (Rom. 14.23.) "By Faith Chri&s;tians may derive a worthine&s;s and virtue to their meane&s;t performances,"&mdash;but with|out the vital efficacy of this Grace all their glitter|ing duties are but <HI>dead works,</HI> &amp; lifele&s;s &s;hadows, unacceptable to God, and unavailable to Salva|tion. But now without the Scriptures, we &s;hou'd be entirely at a lo&s;s, as to this &s;uper-natural Grace. Hence it is &s;aid, Joh. 20.31. <HI>The&s;e are written, that ye might believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t
<PB N="104" REF="002024_0111_0FBA792A5C215EC8">
the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life thro' his name.</HI> The <HI>Object</HI> of Faith is only reveal'd in the Scripture, and &s;o the <HI>ground</HI> of Faith depends on the Scripture. True Faith is built on the Te&s;timony of God, and is re&s;olv'd into the authority and veracity of God &s;peaking in His Word. But how &s;hall any one believe, without knowing the te&s;timony that is given? How is it po&s;&s;ible for any to believe aright con|cerning the Redeemer, either as to matter or manner, without revelation?&mdash;and this is to be found no where but in the written Word, or <HI>Bible,</HI> (Rom. 10.14, 17.) This is the alone adaequate Rule and Foundation of Faith; and that Faith (whatever it relates to) is not <HI>Divine,</HI> but mere|ly <HI>Humane,</HI> which ari&s;es barely from natural Light.</P>
<P>AGAIN, As to the Grace of filial <HI>Fear,</HI> we &s;hou'd al&s;o be at a lo&s;s without the Scriptures. We may indeed be &s;truck with a trembling <HI>horror,</HI> and &s;ervile <HI>dread</HI> of God, from &s;ome amazing di&s;plays of His terrible Greatne&s;s, and awful Holine&s;s in the works of Creation and Providence; but that is no <HI>gratious</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, which is only tormenting to &s;en&s;e, and throws the mind into a &s;torm and confu&s;ion It is only the Scriptures that bring to light tho&s;e ingenuous con&s;iderations, that are proper and apt &s;o to temper and purify this affection, as to render it an <HI>acceptable reverence, and godly fear.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, As to the Grace of <HI>Love</HI>; in this we &s;hou'd be very defective without the knowledge of the Scriptures. Love is the generous principle of willing obedience to God, the &s;ub&s;tance of univer|&s;al Religion, &amp; the perfective character of moral Vertues. Now the writings of the wi&s;e&s;t Heathen &s;ay
<PB N="105" REF="002024_0112_0FBA792C884E1558">
little or nothing of this affection. The Scrip|tures only recommend, and enjoin this Principle; and they only furni&s;h us with &s;uitable and &s;uffi|cient excitations to enliven and actuate it. Love has a great many incentives from the Goodne&s;s of God E&s;&s;ential, Creating, and Providential; But this Grace "never breaths like it &s;elf", 'till animated and warmed by motives of a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> &s;train. Unle&s;s the <HI>Love of God in Christ con&s;train us</HI> and inflame our affections, <HI>when we thus judge that Chri&s;t by the grace of God ta&s;ted Death for every man,</HI> our Love is not genuine, &amp; true; but where is the Love of God in Chri&s;t revealed, &s;ave in the Scriptures?</P>
<P>La&s;tly, THE knowlege of the Scriptures is nece&s;&s;ary to the con&s;titution of a regular <HI>Hope.</HI> As Hope is the Anchor of the Soul, &s;o the Pro|mi&s;es of God are the Ba&s;is of Hope; But the&s;e are revealed in the Scriptures only. It is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n <HI>through comfort of the Scriptures that we have ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> (Rom. 15.4.) Without Scripture-foundation our Hope is nothing but Dream, and pre&s;umption, and <HI>a thing of nought.</HI>&mdash;Thus as to the <HI>Principles</HI> of Obedience.</P>
<P>AGAIN, As to the <HI>Parts</HI> of Duty, what a mi|&s;erable lo&s;s &s;hou'd be at without the conduct of Scripture-Light? The whole World indeed, <HI>even the People that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it in darkne&s;s,</HI> have &s;ome confus'd notion of a Supreme Being, are touch'd with &s;ome &s;light impre&s;&s;ions of that homage we owe to God, from the dictates of natural rea|&s;on: but they run into an unaccountable variety of the ranke&s;t Errors and Super&s;titions. Religion changes with every Air, and puts on a new face <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> every Climate, where the Light of God's
<PB N="106" REF="002024_0113_0FBA792E3748E0B8">
Word does not &s;hine. Every one walketh <HI>in the way of his God, in the way of his own heart, and in the &s;ight of his own eyes. There are that follow after lying vanities, and do &s;ervice to them, that are by nature no God's.</HI> (Gal. 4.8.) There are <HI>that know God, but glorify Him not as God, being vain in their imaginations.</HI> (Rom. 1.21.)</P>
<P>AS for the <HI>Po&s;itive</HI> In&s;titutions of the Wor&s;hip of God, <HI>(agreeable to what One ob&s;erves)</HI> they re|&s;ulting immediately from His arbitrary &amp; ab&s;olute Will, Hence &s;uch as are &s;trangers to the written Word, mu&s;t undoubtedly be unacquainted with their nature, number, ends &amp; u&s;es. And for want of a careful regard to the Word of God, what fopperies and follies do &s;uch, as enjoy it, many times bring into the Wor&s;hip of God? What <HI>vain Oblations</HI> do they offer, and what <HI>corrupt things do they Sacrifice to the Lord,</HI> who take their mea&s;ures from a luxu|riant Invention, and not from divine Revelation?</P>
<P>AND then, as to tho&s;e Duties that are <HI>Moral,</HI> of immutable rea&s;on, and perpetual obligation, the Word of God is a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &amp; &s;ufficient Guide unto us. It gives us a complete Sy&s;tem of natural Religion &amp; moral Vertues, &s;uch as the be&s;t Ma&s;ters of Morality in the Heathen World cou'd never afford. <HI>Their</HI> pure&s;t Ethicks were &s;tain'd with impure mixtures, with corrupt Precepts, or fal&s;e permi&s;&s;ions; &amp; the greate&s;t Length that ever any attain'd by the help of their mo&s;t excellent rules, was only a negative purity, moral hone&s;ty, and &s;u|perficial civility, ju&s;tice, kindne&s;s and honor; all which is va&s;tly &s;hort of our ju&s;t obligations. The <HI>School of Nature</HI> was never &s;o illuminated, as to be able to teach us our univer&s;al Duty. But the <HI>Word</HI> of God "&s;ets before us a Rule of Life
<PB N="107" REF="002024_0114_0FBA793064DD9B58">
pure and per&s;picuous, in nothing &s;uperfluous or defective, but comprehending the entire duty of Man". <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect,</HI> (P&s;al. 19.7.) The Scripture contains <HI>all the Ordinances, and Com|mandments of the Lord.</HI> It tells us <HI>what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God</HI>; It &s;hews us <HI>what is good, and what the Lord our God doth require of us,</HI> and that in it's full latitude, and extent. It de&s;cribes all tho&s;e works of <HI>Sobriety,</HI> (which more immediately re&s;pect the govern|ment of <HI>our &s;elves</HI>) and all tho&s;e works of <HI>Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> (which do principally re&s;pect our carriage towards our <HI>Neighbour</HI> (and all tho&s;e works of <HI>Piety,</HI> (that chiefly re&s;pect our behaviour towards <HI>God)</HI> which general Heads comprize the &s;um of our Duty, and are the E|pitome of that Holine&s;s, which is the appointed condition of Salvation. The Precepts of the Word extend to the <HI>whole Man,</HI> direct all the Powers of the Soul, and pre&s;ide over the &s;en&s;es and members of the Body. They reach to <HI>all Ca&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Times,</HI> and in&s;truct us how to behave our &s;elves in every &s;tation and relation, in every &s;tate and condition of Life. The Word of God&punc; pre&s;cribes the mo&s;t perfect Law &amp; con&s;ummate indefective Rule to <HI>order our Conver&s;ation</HI> by, that ever the World heard of. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed</HI> therefore are they, and <HI>highly favour'd of the Lord,</HI> unto whom <HI>He has written the great things of his Law.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, The Word of God &s;tates the true <HI>Ends,</HI> which &s;hou'd influence &amp; governs us in all our acti|ons, in order to their rectitude. Purity of intention is a nece&s;&s;ary qualification, yea, the very Life &amp; Soul of a good work. And be an act never &s;o &s;pecious and
<PB N="108" REF="002024_0115_0FBA7931B62A7480">
commendable for the &s;ub&s;tance and manner, un|le&s;s it be directed to a right end, the beauty of it is &s;poiled and the reward forfeited. A wrong end is <HI>a dead fly in the pretious ointment</HI>; This <HI>cor|rupts</HI> &amp; <HI>vatiates</HI> our be&s;t performances. A great part of our Duty then lies in fixing right aims, and propo&s;ing regular ends. Now there are inferior and &s;ubordinate ends, as the real felicity of our own Souls, and the true Good of our Neighbours, and there is al&s;o a principal, or ultimate end, as the Glory of God, to which our actions &s;hou'd be directed. Our duty is not perfect, unle&s;s we therein a&s;pire after the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> as our &s;u|preme end. Nothing is more rea&s;onable, than that <HI>we do all for the Glory of God</HI>; &s;eeing we <HI>derive</HI> all our powers and enjoyments <HI>from</HI> Him, we &s;hou'd <HI>improve</HI> all <HI>for</HI> Him; "we do all <HI>by</HI> Him, therefore we &s;hou'd do all <HI>to</HI> Him": Be&s;ides, this is the &s;ame end, which God Him&s;elf acts for; Hence it mu&s;t needs be the be&s;t &amp; highe&s;t, and challenges the priority of all other ends in our intentions.</P>
<P>NOW this noble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd is no where pre&s;cribed, but in the Word of God. That enjoyns an habi|tual, and implicit de&s;ignation of this in all our actions, and an actual or expre&s;s intuition and volition of it in more weighty ca&s;es. See, <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 15.16. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.19, 20. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.11. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.31.&mdash; But where el&s;e is it propounded? As for the Pagan Philo&s;ophers, they were mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly deficient in this matter. In their mo&s;t <HI>refined Morals,</HI> they never mentioned it. They chiefly recommended vertue, only as the way to honor and ea&s;e in the World, or a means of plea&s;ure, and internal Peace; And the utmo&s;t pitch they
<PB N="109" REF="002024_0116_0FBA793589638C98">
ever came to, was to propo&s;e the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s, the amiable rectitude and inherient excellency of virtue: But this is &s;till too low and mean a motive. "For Vertue is but a Ray of the Deity", and we are not perfect in any good work, "unle&s;s it be finally referr'd to His Glory who is the Principle and Pattern of it". It is then the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of God's Word, It's peculiar dignity above all humane Writings, that it directs our performances to the mo&s;t wor|thy end, the Glory of God.&mdash; Thus the Word of God, directs us into the way of Holine&s;s. It is a <HI>Light to the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s, The way|faring Men, though fools, &s;hall not err therein.</HI> (I&s;ai. 35.8.)

It is a Seed: Seed tho' &s;mall, is active. 'Tis a Gla&s;s, that not only repre&s;ents the Image of God, but <HI>by the Spirit changeth us into it,</HI> 2 Cor. 3.18. How powerful is that Word, which changeth a Bea&s;t into a Man, a Devil into an Angel, a Clod of Earth into a Star of Heaven! 'Tis above the power of all moral Philo&s;ophy, and the Political Government ef the be&s;t States. It's power ap|pears in the <HI>Subjects</HI> it hath been in&s;trumental to change, (Hearts full of the filthie&s;t lu&s;ts, have thereby been transform'd into Ve&s;&s;els of purity.) And in the <HI>&s;uddenne&s;s</HI> of it's operation (How have Troops of unma&s;ter'd Lu&s;ts fled at the Voice of the Go&s;pel-Trumpet, like a Flock of frightned Birds, and left their long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Man&s;ion!) and <HI>one part,</HI> one particle of the Word hath wrought wonders many times.&mdash; A &s;ingle &s;entence, one plain Scripture has kill'd a Man's Sins, and erected an Heavenly Trophy in a Soul; which &s;hews the power and effica|cious virtue of the Word, acting more vigorou&s;ly than all humane Rea&s;on in the World. This the experience of every Age can te&s;tify. Tho' the Word be not a natural In&s;trument to work nece&s;&s;arily, yet it is liken'd to natural In&s;tru|ments, which are active under the efficiency of the Agent, which manages them. And an <HI>Activity</HI> &s;eems to be a&s;crib'd to it by Scripture-<HI>Meta|phors</HI></Q>.

<P>THE Word is compared to <HI>Light</HI>; which is of an undefilable quality in it &s;elf, and a purifying influence as to other things: Hence it is call'd the <HI>refining pot of Nature</HI>; The World wou'd be an unwhole&s;ome Pe&s;t-hou&s;e without it.

<P>AGAIN, It is likened to an <HI>Hammer,</HI> (Jer. 23.29) The Word often breaks in pieces the <HI>hard hearts</HI> of Men, the&s;e rocks within us; it beats down the ne&s;t of filthy Lu&s;ts in the Soul: It drives home convictions, <HI>reproofs, &amp; in&s;tructions in Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and fa&s;tens good impre&s;&s;ions on the Con&s;cience, <HI>as Nails in a &s;ure place.</HI> Hence while <HI>Peter</HI> Preach'd his Hearers <HI>were pricked in their hearts,</HI> Act. 2.37.</P>
<P>AGAIN, It is likned unto <HI>Fire</HI>; (Jer. 20.9.&mdash; 23.29. Luk. 12.49.)

<P>THE Word is particularly compared to <HI>Rain,</HI> (Deut. 32.2.) <HI>Showers</HI> of Rain &s;erve (among other things) to clean&s;e our Streets; the &s;weeping &s;treams carry off the filth and dirt, that we may walk and keep our feet clean.

Even &s;o the <HI>Waters of the Sanctu|ary</HI> &s;ometimes come in an impetuous manner, and powerfully bear down our filthy Lu&s;ts and clean&s;e our ways: and &s;ometimes the &s;mall droppings of the Word gently di&s;till, and &s;o lay our cor|ruptions, which otherwi&s;e the wind of Tempta|tion wou'd blow up to defile us, and to blind our eyes, and &s;top us in our cour&s;e, or turn us out of the path, and run us upon boggs, and into &s;loughs and miles.&mdash;It might be further ob&s;erved here, that <HI>Rain</HI>-water is the mo&s;t clean&s;ing, if we u&s;e it to wa&s;h our &s;elves with; in this the <HI>Word</HI> is like unto it.</P>

efficacy. The Dogmatical, or Doctrinal part of Scripture, or tho&s;e <HI>Truths,</HI> that are the ob|ject of Faith, have a rational tendency, and moral influence to promote our holy living. 'Twas the reproach of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Theology, that on many accounts it was the in&s;trument of vice; it a&s;cribed not only the weak pa&s;&s;ion, but odious vices of Men to the God's, repre&s;enting <HI>Jupiter</HI> as an Adul|terer, <HI>Bacchus</HI> as a Drunkard, &amp;c. And many of their &s;acred My&s;teries, as well as &s;olemn Ceremonies, (as one ob&s;erves) <HI>were of &s;uch a Nature, that instead of refining and elevating, they rather corrupted and deba&s;ed their Votaries,</HI> and immer&s;t them in all tho&s;e abominable pollutions, which &s;ober Nature abhorr'd, and which render'd 'em more vile than than the filthie&s;t Brutes. But now the Prin|ciples, and Truths, and My&s;teries in the Word of God, have a proper influence towards the &s;pi|ritualizing and purifying of us, and perfecting our Natures. The Apo&s;tle calls the Doctrine of the Go&s;pel a <HI>Form of &s;ound Words,</HI> (2 Tim. 1.3.) <HI>Whole|&s;ome Words,</HI> (1 Tim. 6.3.) i.e. pure and incorrupt in them&s;elves, &amp; tending to prevent &s;piritual di&s;tem|pers, or re&s;tore to the Soul it's &s;piritual health: <HI>and a Doctrine according to Godline&s;s,</HI> i.e. tending to the advancement of practical Piety. So the Apo&s;tle &s;tyles it, (Tit. 1.1.) <HI>The Truth which is after Godline&s;s,</HI> i. e. productive of Godline&s;s. "Lu&s;ts grow from Error and Deceit; hence they are call'd <HI>Lusts of Deceit:</HI> and Holine&s;s grows up from Truth; hence it is call'd, <HI>The Holine&s;s of Truth.</HI> (Eph. 4.22.4.) This is the triumphal Chariot, wherein Chri&s;t rides Maje&s;tically to the conque&s;t of Hearts.

Hence, the Apo&s;tle calls the Doctrine of the Go&s;pel <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r mo&s;t holy Faith</HI> (Jud ver. 20.) as being the means of promoting holine&s;s in us.

Here we have an account of the guilt, and filth and mi&s;ery of our natural e&s;tate, and this tends to check the tumor of pride and ar|rogance, and to make us low in our own Eyes: Here we are taught the vilene&s;s, deformity and malignity of Sin, that it is loath&s;ome and pro|voking to God, and injurious to our own Souls,

The Precepts of the Word are an authentic Copy of the Divine Perfections and an uncounterfeit In&s;trument of God's revealed Will.

It is the chief and &s;overeign Law, &amp; it carries a <HI>mo&s;t Kingly Power, Grandour</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t Maje&s;ty,</HI> that when it <HI>&s;peaks,</HI> every atten|tive mind cannot but hear the <HI>Voice of God,</HI> which &s;trikes with awe &amp; commands reverence.

The dread Maje&s;ty of God, &s;o con&s;picuous in the Divine Precepts, gives them a far more exceeding imperative authority and impre&s;&s;ive power.</P>
<P>NOW (to conclude this Head) Do the Precepts of the Word aim at &s;uch <HI>high Purity,</HI> and do they carry in them &s;uch unconte&s;tible <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> to re|commend them, &amp; &s;uch uncontrollable <HI>Authority</HI> to enforce them: Then they are extremely fitted to make their own way into the hearts of Men; &amp; where they find &s;uitable entertainment, will be an efficacious means to clean&s;e our way. They are of &s;uch a <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>complexion,</HI> and &s;o <HI>qualify'd,</HI> as that they are very apt to draw Men's regards, and win us over to the ob&s;ervance of them; and <HI>as many as walk according to the&s;e Rules,</HI> mu&s;t needs <HI>be undefiled in the way, and without rebuke.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. THE <HI>Threatnings</HI> of the Word have a clean&s;ing efficacy. The wi&s;e Legi&s;lator has &s;een meet to annex a <HI>minatory</HI> Sanction to His Law;
<PB N="127" REF="002024_0134_0FBA7961AF8B6EB8">
to be a Guardian of it's Authority and Honor, to be a <HI>Terror to Evil-Doers,</HI> and a di&s;&s;ua&s;ive from <HI>Sin</HI> which is the <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law.</HI> And the Divine Threatnings are every way fitted to &s;ub&s;erve the de&s;igned end.</P>
<P>THIS I'll endeavour to clear under the following Conclu&s;ions. &mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>FEAR is a Pa&s;&s;ion, rooted in the Nature of Man.</HI> An Aver&s;ion to Mi&s;ery is natural to every one. No Man is <HI>made without fear.</HI> &mdash; The Report of the Under&s;tanding is the Rule of the Will, in all regular motions of the Soul. What that repre&s;ents as evil, and apprehends as future, this abhors and flies from. &mdash; Hence, The Threatnings of the Word which are me&s;&s;ages of Evil to guilty Sinners, are a proper medium to u&s;e with them to re&s;train them from Sin, ina&s;much as they addre&s;s one of the Pa&s;&s;ions of humane Nature, and are a ju&s;t Alarm to the Fears of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>FEAR is the mo&s;t powerful Principle of Action.</HI> Hope &amp; Fear are the two great &s;prings of motion in humane nature. But <HI>Fear</HI> is the <HI>more violent</HI> and <HI>vigorous</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion, "U&s;ually the fear of Evil more deeply and &s;trongly affects, than the hope of Good". And Fear is al&s;o more <HI>ea&s;ily touch't.</HI> It is ea&s;ier of acce&s;s, as well as more impetuous in exerci&s;e. It has a <HI>quicker,</HI> as well as <HI>deeper,</HI> re&s;entment. Fear is a tender, a zealous, and re&s;tle&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion. When <HI>&s;truck</HI> with an object, it is more &s;peedy and pre&s;&s;ing in its flight, than Hope, when drawn by an object, is in it's pur&s;uit. "Therefore Laws are &s;ecur'd by Puni&s;hments, not by Rewards". Hence the Threatnings of the Word are a mo&s;t &s;uitable Argument to make im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="128" REF="002024_0135_0FBA7963F5A801F8">
on Mankind, in that they are apt to work upon one of the <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t powerful</HI> and <HI>active</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions of Humanity.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE Divine Threatnings are completely fitted to be the mo&s;t forceable excitations to Fear.</HI> They are every way excellently calculated to work <HI>powerfully, mo&s;t</HI> powerfully, on the Fears of Men.</P>
<P>This will appear,</P>
<P N="1">1. IF we con&s;ider the <HI>Cleanne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Plainne&s;s</HI> of them. They are as full and expre&s;s as po&s;&s;ible. They are not given in <HI>dark hints:</HI> But are drawn in the <HI>cleare&s;t Colours.</HI> We have <HI>fair</HI> warning, <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> notice of our danger, &amp; there is no room left for <HI>Doubts,</HI> that &s;hou'd weaken the impre&s;&s;ion or le&s;&s;on the terror of the Threatning. The Law of God <HI>Thunders</HI> out the dire Anathema, that, unle&s;s we &s;top our Ears, we cannot but <HI>hear the Words of the Cur&s;e</HI>: It <HI>lightens</HI> and <HI>fla&s;hes</HI> in our face, that unle&s;s we wilfully &s;hut our Eyes, we cannot but &s;ee our fearful doom. &mdash; Now this is a great advantage to the Divine Threatnings. For the motive of Fear is an apparition of &s;ome Evil. And the clearer the report of danger is, &s;o much the higher does our fear ri&s;e in proportion. Hence the Divine Threatnings, &s;peaking &s;o <HI>plainly,</HI> do &s;peak the more <HI>&s;en&s;ibly,</HI> and the more effectu|ally reach the Fears of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF we con&s;ider the <HI>infallible</HI> and <HI>inflexible Truth</HI> of them. The Evils, they denounce, are undoubted Realities: and the Comminations them&s;elves are plainly revealed, and are <HI>accom|pany'd with the &s;tronge&s;t Motives of Credibility.</HI> They are delivered in the mo&s;t preremptory Terms imaginable, and we've the highe&s;t a&s;&s;u|rances of their certainty. The <HI>God of Truth (who&s;e
<PB N="129" REF="002024_0136_0FBA7969EEB83098">
words endure forever</HI>) has <HI>revealed</HI> them <HI>from Hea|ven,</HI> and hath added <HI>an Oath for confirmation,</HI> which <HI>is an end of all &s;trife. Wherein God willing more abundantly to &s;hew unto</HI> Sinners <HI>the immutability of his coun&s;el, confirmed it by an Oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for God to lye, we might have</HI> a <HI>&s;trong</HI> per&s;wa&s;ion, &amp; that there might be no room to di&s;pute or que&s;tion the Execution of His Threatnings. How con|&s;tantly are the Divine Menaces introduc'd with the &s;olemn Preface&mdash;<HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord</HI>&mdash; and, <HI>As I live, &s;aith the Lord</HI>&mdash;? And how awfully do's the Lord <HI>&s;wear in His Wrath</HI> again&s;t the ob&s;ti|nate Sinner, where He &s;aith, <HI>As I live, &s;urely mine Oath, that He hath de&s;pi&s;ed, even it will I recompence on his own head.</HI>&mdash; And this is one great Advantage to the Divine Threatnings, and gives them great power over Men's Fears. For the ju&s;t Object of Fear is <HI>Evil apprehended as fu|ture.</HI> The immediate ground of Fear is the <HI>ap|prehen&s;ion</HI> of an approaching Evil. 'Tis the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of danger, that moves fear: and the &s;tronger the apprehen&s;ion of an Evil is, the &s;tronger is the pa&s;&s;i|on again&s;t it. Hence the Divine Threatnings, giving us &s;uch <HI>full a&s;&s;urance</HI> and convincing evidence of the real futurity of the un&s;een Plagues &amp; Puni&s;h|ments of the Wicked, mu&s;t needs have a mighty force, to awaken and actuate the Fears of Sinners.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF we con&s;ider the &s;uperlative <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI> of them. The Threatned Evils are great, exceeding great, beyond expre&s;&s;ion, and above all conception. The Threatnings addre&s;s us with a mo&s;t formidable &s;cene of Mi&s;eries, &s;uch as <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard of.</HI> Sinners are

threaten'd with extreme and everla&s;ting puni&s;h|ment, &mdash;a puni&s;hment, as intollerable as the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of God cou'd <HI>invent</HI>; as &s;evere, as the <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of God cou'd <HI>excite</HI> Him unto; as heavy, as the <HI>Power</HI> of God can <HI>inflict</HI>; and <HI>who knoweth the Power of His Anger? Strong is the Lord that judgeth, mighty in &s;trength, wi&s;e in heart, and glorious in holine&s;s.</HI> &mdash;The Divine Threatnings denounce <HI>infinite</HI> Evils, the mo&s;t dreadful &amp; devouring, which the &s;tout|e&s;t atlas mu&s;t tremble &amp; &s;ink under, &amp; the weight whereof the mo&s;t hardy Sinner has not patience nor power to endure.&mdash;The Scripture repre&s;ents to us the <HI>Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment</HI> under a variety of Names, that &s;peak terror &amp; amazement to every con&s;idering Soul. It is de&s;cribed by <HI>Death</HI>; by <HI>Slaughter</HI>; by <HI>Perdition and De&s;truction</HI>; by a <HI>Lo&s;s of the Soul</HI>; by a <HI>De&s;truction of Soul and Body in Hell</HI>; by <HI>Departing from God</HI>; by being <HI>ca&s;t into utter darkne&s;s</HI>; by <HI>Dwelling with devouring Fire and everla&s;ting Burnings</HI>; and (which is the Sum of all) by <HI>abiding under the Wrath of God</HI>; and finally (which is the effect of all) by <HI>wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth,</HI> and <HI>being in torments day &amp; night, for ever and ever.</HI> The threatned Puni&s;hment in|comparably exceeds all the terrors of &s;en&s;e. The <HI>Sufferings of the pre&s;ent time,</HI> in their full Col|lection and highe&s;t Degree, <HI>are not worthy to be compared with the</HI> mi&s;ery to be inflicted on the Damned. It is <HI>wor&s;e than Death</HI>; it infinitely outweighs the utmo&s;t evils we can imagine, and infinitely out-reaches our mo&s;t unbounded fears. <HI>Even according to thy fear, &s;o is thy wrath,</HI> and in|finitely more, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 90.11.&mdash; "One &s;park of God's Wrath firing the Con&s;cience, is more ter|rible, than the mo&s;t fearful Evils in the World",
<PB N="113" REF="002024_0138_0FBA796D050C05D0">
to affect, and excite the fears of Men. <HI>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. The Damnation of Hell</HI> is infinitely terrible. <HI>The Sinners in Zion</HI> may well be <HI>afraid, and fear|fulne&s;s &s;urprize the Hypocrite,</HI> when they think of the <HI>Fire and Brime&s;tone, and the horrible Tem|pe&s;t,</HI> that will be <HI>the Portion of their Cup.</HI>&mdash;The expected Evil mu&s;t be look'd upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> great, pon|derous and powerful, and not (<HI>ea&s;ily,</HI> at lea&s;t) to be grapled with, in order to it's creating fear and cau&s;ing fright. And the degree of Fear is ordinarily corre&s;pondent to the apprehended bigne&s;s and weight of the object. Therefore the Divine Threatnings which are charg'd with Evils of &s;uch an huge bulk and tremendous a&s;pect, and which make &s;o big a Thunder, mu&s;t needs (if they be duly con&s;ider'd and attended to) work mo&s;t prevalently on the pa&s;&s;ion of Fear, &amp; rai&s;e it to the highe&s;t pitch. <HI>De&s;truction from God</HI> mu&s;t needs be <HI>a Terror to us.

<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider, THE <HI>imminent danger</HI> Sinners are <HI>daily</HI> in of the <HI>Execution</HI> of the Divine Threat|nings upon them.

Sinners will "break thro' the hedge of the Law, unle&s;s they feel tho&s;e wounding Thorns, the fearful Threatnings in it".

The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, (2 Pet. 1, 4.) That they <HI>are given to us, that by the&s;e we might be partakers of the Divine Nature,</HI> i. e. transform'd into the image of Divine purity. And another Apo&s;tle u&s;es them as an argument or incentive unto ho|line&s;s, (Rom. 12.1, 2.) <HI>I be&s;eech you by the mercies of God, that ye pre&s;ent your &s;elves a living &s;acri|fice, holy, acceptable unto God; and be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renew|ing of your mind.</HI> So likewi&s;e (2 Cor. 7.1.) <HI>Having the&s;e promi&s;es, let us clean&s;e our &s;elves from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit.</HI> q. d.

Let us improve our happy advantage. &mdash; The&s;e Scriptures plainly &s;how, that the <HI>end &amp; office, &amp; proper in|fluence of the Divine Promi&s;es is to make us pure and holy.</HI>&mdash;And this is the Point, which I am now to <HI>illustrate.</HI> And here a very large Field of Di&s;cour&s;e opens before us: But I &s;hall content my &s;elf with the&s;e following Hints.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THE Promi&s;es have a purifying influence upon us, <HI>from the kind &amp; quality of the &s;ubject-matter, or Things offered in them.</HI> The Goods contained in the Promi&s;es are&mdash;</P>

thir&s;t after felicity, altho' we pur|&s;ue various objects according to our different re&s;entments of happine&s;s; and when the object is con&s;ider'd as attainable, this begets hope, and hope produces endeavour.

The greater and more excellent the object hoped for, the &s;tronger influence will the hope of it have upon us, and the more powerfully will it wing and animate our endeavours, and draw us to u&s;e the means of obtaining it.&mdash; Now the Divine Promi&s;es engage the highe&s;t &s;atisfactions, and propound the mo&s;t de&s;ireable objects of Hope: and hence they mu&s;t needs (if duly realiz'd and con&s;ider'd) have a very attractive influence on Men; for they addre&s;s in the mo&s;t <HI>powerful</HI> manner to the fundamental principle of &s;elf-love, which breeds in&s;atiable <HI>De&s;ires</HI> to promote our own happine&s;s, and to the praedominant pa&s;&s;ion of Hope, which produces indefatigable <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> in the pur&s;uit thereof.

The Go&s;pel <HI>&s;ets forth the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as a Pro|pitiation for Sin, and Preaches remi&s;&s;ion of Sins thro' his Blood</HI>; and it proclames the Name of God, <HI>the Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merci|ful, &s;low to anger, ready to forgive</HI>; and abounds with Promi&s;es of Pardon. Hence, the Go&s;pel is call'd the <HI>Go&s;pel of Peace, the Word of Reconcili|ation,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash; Now by the Promi&s;e of Pardon, Sinners have their doubts re&s;olved &amp; their fears relieved touching the Divine Mercy: And this greatly tends
<Q>to overcome our guilty di&s;affecti|on to God. For while terrible apprehen&s;ions of the Deity po&s;&s;e&s;s the heart, 'tis frozen with a &s;tony rigor, which the hope of Mercy only can di&s;&s;olve</Q>.
De&s;pair chills and cools all e&s;&s;ays to repent, and hardens Men in the love and practice of Sin. A hopele&s;s mind and a care|le&s;s temper are common Companions. Faith and Hope are the root and principle of Repentance and Obedience. The pro&s;pect of recovering the lo&s;t favour of God &s;trongly invites Sinners to clean&s;e their ways. &mdash; Be&s;ides the Promi&s;e of
<PB N="144" REF="002024_0151_0FBA798B11EEAED8">
Pardon is &s;uch an endearing expre&s;&s;ion of God's Love and Good-will unto &s;elf-ruin'd Man, as mo&s;t powerfully <HI>leadeth to Repentance:</HI> This is a mighty di&s;&s;ua&s;ive from Sin, and a forceable per&s;wa&s;ive unto Duty. A believing view of the free Grace and rich mercy of God in the Redemp|tion by Chri&s;t, tends to beget in us kindly re|lentings and remor&s;e for Sin, to warm &amp; &s;often our hearts, and di&s;&s;olve them into a current of penitential tears and religious affections.&mdash; To con&s;ider how we have forfeited the favour of God; To con&s;ider, that we may now obtain a Pardon, that the mo&s;t heinous Sins, and the chief of Sinners may obtain mercy of the Lord; To con&s;ider, that God offers freely and irrever&s;ibly to be&s;tow pardoning mercy on us, <HI>on us,</HI> who indi&s;|pen&s;ably need it, and are infinitely unworthy of it,&mdash;&s;urely, if there be any principle of Honor, any &s;park of ingenuity, or gratitude re|maining in us, we mu&s;t be <HI>drawn by the&s;e hands of Love</HI> and per&s;waded <HI>by the Mercies of God to pre&s;ent our Bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy and ac|ceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> What can be more welcome to a condemned Criminal than a Par|don? God offers this to an obnoxious World. Surely the&s;e glad Tidings of great joy &s;hou'd not only check our de&s;ponding fears, but melt our congeal'd affections, excite in us Repentance towards God, ravi&s;h our love, and in&s;pire our Souls with flaming de&s;ires, and firm re&s;olutions, in all things to obey and plea&s;e a God, &s;o abun|dant in Goodne&s;s and plenteous in Mercy. And &s;urely if the con&s;ideration of the Promi&s;e of Pardoning Mercy has not this effect upon us, we mu&s;t be ba&s;e and ungrateful to the la&s;t degree,

and have hearts more in&s;en&s;ible than the Rocks.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Promi&s;e <HI>of the Holy Spirit</HI> is another very engaging motive to clean&s;e our ways. The Word of God promi&s;es us the Spirit of Grace to be our Teacher, Guide, Sanctifier and Com|forter. And what good News mu&s;t this needs be to a lo&s;t and di&s;con&s;olate, peri&s;hing World, a World that lyes in wickedne&s;s, and in dark|ne&s;s! What a &s;uitable and needful Ble&s;&s;ing is the Spirit of God? <HI>Thro' the &s;upply of the Spirit,</HI> we who are naturally <HI>without &s;trength,</HI> &s;hall be enabled to <HI>perfect holine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>to work out our Salvation.</HI> But without the Divine Spirit we mu&s;t have langui&s;ht in fruitle&s;s attempts, and <HI>peri&s;ht</HI> for ever <HI>in our corruption.</HI> There is no|thing el&s;e is able to revive and recover us out of our natural &s;tate of carnality. The mo&s;t happy con&s;titution of Body and the mo&s;t excellent natural temper of mind, with the mo&s;t perfect rules of living, the highe&s;t motives and the be&s;t patterns are not &s;ufficient Re&s;toratives. There is no principle of recovery in our degene|rate Nature, and as well may a dead Carca&s;e revive and act of it &s;elf, or the lifele&s;s Clay form it &s;elf into a Ve&s;&s;el of Honor, as Apo&s;tate Man by his own &s;ingle efforts, or with the uni|ver&s;al confederacy of Creature aids, &s;anctify him&s;elf and perform <HI>obedience unto righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> If we have not &s;ome &s;uperior Power to <HI>help our infirmities,</HI> we mu&s;t for ever de&s;pair of <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our Ve&s;&s;el in &s;anctification and honor.</HI>&mdash; Now the Promi&s;e of God offers the Holy Spirit, who&s;e <HI>Grace is &s;ufficient for us,</HI> a perfect Salve for our impotence.

<PB N="146" REF="002024_0153_0FBA798EFB48F8B0">
our con&s;piring Adver&s;aries, need not damp nor di&s;courage our endeavours to <HI>do the will of God,</HI> and to <HI>make our calling and election &s;ure.</HI> The Spirit, who is promis'd us, is a <HI>Spirit of might and power,</HI> of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and of <HI>Grace</HI>; every way more able and willing to help us, than our Ene|mies to hinder us.&mdash;Now to con&s;ider, that with|out &s;upernatural influences we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily and unavoidably peri&s;h; To con&s;ider, that the Divine Spirit is offer'd to us, and that by His effectual energy we &s;hall be <HI>able to do all things,</HI> &s;hall be fortify'd again&s;t all Difficulties, and furni&s;ht unto all Duties; and <HI>by the power of His might</HI> we &s;hall be enabled to <HI>purify our Souls in obeying the Truth</HI> unto the end.&mdash; What per|&s;ua&s;ive con&s;iderations are the&s;e? What powerful incentives to <HI>provoke us to Good Works?</HI> What can tend more to elevate our drooping &s;pirits, to enliven and actuate our diligence, and make us to excite and exert our &s;elves (with a due dependence on the Holy Spirit) in the mortifi|cation of our Lu&s;ts, &amp; the purification of our Lives?</P>
<P N="3">3 THE Promi&s;e of <HI>Heaven</HI> is likewi&s;e a powerful motive to clean&s;e our way. <HI>This is the Promi&s;e, which God hath promi&s;ed us, even Eternal Life</HI> (1 Joh. 2.25.) an happine&s;s becoming His in|finite &s;ufficiency to confer, and us to &s;eek after: a pure and perfect Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.

animate us (again&s;t all intervening difficulties) in the pur&s;uit of this glorious Prize.&mdash; And it is <HI>Holy,</HI> as well as Great: Pure and Spiritual. It is what <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood cannot inherit.</HI> Our Bodies mu&s;t be &s;piritualiz'd and our Souls pu|rify'd, in order to a capacity for and enjoyment of it.

<P N="2">(2.) THE Promi&s;es have a clean&s;ing efficacy <HI>from the Tenor and Manner of their Con&s;titution and Propo&s;al.</HI> Here it may &s;uffice to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY are <HI>Deliver'd in the fulle&s;t and cleare&s;t Terms.</HI> "They are not wrapt up in Clouds and dark <HI>Aenigmatical</HI> In&s;inuations, wherein Men mu&s;t exerci&s;e their <HI>Sagacity</HI> as well as their Faith". But they &s;hine out with the cleare&s;t Light, and we all <HI>with open face behold</HI> in them, <HI>as in a Gla&s;s, the great Things, which God hath laid up for them that love him.</HI> Here the recom|pences of pure Religion lye fair &amp; open to pro&s;pect. The Me&s;&s;ages of Peace are mo&s;t plain, expre&s;s and explicit, &amp; give us a true conception &amp; full convic|tion

of tho&s;e glorious un&s;een Realities, of which &s;uch as enjoy not Go&s;pel-revelation can have but very loo&s;e &amp; ob&s;cure apprehen&s;ions. And this gives the Promi&s;es of the Word an attractive influence.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY are <HI>Confirmed with the mo&s;t inviolable Securities.</HI> If the Promi&s;es were doubtful or uncertain, the encouragement to &s;eek an intere&s;t in them wou'd be but weak and faint: But they are &s;table as the Ordinances of Heaven. They are ratify'd with the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances. They are <HI>&s;ure Words of Prophecy,</HI> mo&s;t evident and certain, <HI>proceeding out of the mouth of God, the God of Truth,</HI> and &s;ealed by an <HI>Oath, to &s;hew the immutability of his coun&s;el,</HI> (Heb. 6.17.) Now this is an excellent character that mu&s;t needs greatly recommend them to us, and <HI>beget us to a lively hope. This World's Goods</HI> are <HI>uncertain Riches:</HI> But the Ble&s;&s;ings offered in the Promi&s;es are <HI>&s;ure Mercies.</HI> And what more pro&s;&s;ing incentive to Religion, than this? It is the Apo&s;tle's cho&s;en Argument, (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.58.) Therefore my beloved Brethren, Be ye &s;tedfa&s;t, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, <HI>fora&s;much as ye know that your labour &s;hall not be in vain in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THEY are <HI>altogether free, gracious and gra|tuitous.</HI> They are the pure re&s;ult of free Grace and &s;overeign Mercy. As to the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> them|&s;elves contained in the Promi&s;es, it is owing to the rich Love and mere Mercy of God, that they are obtainable. The Redemption by Chri&s;t was the production of free Good-will, and mo&s;t vo|luntary &s;elf-moving Grace. God has &s;hewn <HI>ex|ceeding riches of Grace in his kindne&s;s towards us by Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> (Eph. 2.7.) God was under no ne|ce&s;&s;ity,

Nay, He might without any impeachment of His Ju&s;tice have cau&s;ed His fury to re&s;t upon the whole race of &s;inful Man, and have puni&s;h'd as with &s;wift de&s;truction, and that without remedy, as He did the whole Crew of Apo&s;tate Angels, who immediately on their revolt were clapt in Chains, and are re&s;erv'd as Pri&s;oners of Ju&s;tice unto the day of Perdition. Nay, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s &amp; Holine&s;s of God <HI>demanded</HI> this, and <HI>call'd for Vengeance</HI> to con&s;ume us utterly: But <HI>Mercy rejoyced over Judgment,</HI> and triumph'd over our Unworthine&s;s, and provided <HI>a Saviour</HI> for us; <HI>in and thro' whom God is reconciling the World unto Him&s;elf,</HI> and magnifying His Mercy towards Penitent Sinners, without any detriment to His Ju&s;tice, or defile|ment of His Purity. Here is Love, unmerited, unasked, unforced; Love without Example and beyond Expre&s;&s;ion! Love which we are as un|capable to conceive of, as we were unworthy to be the objects of! And &s;urely this Love of God (if duly con&s;ider'd) mu&s;t <HI>con&s;train us,</HI> mu&s;t &s;trongly and &s;weetly draw our hearts, &amp; warm our cold affections, and kindle in our Souls a flaming Love; Love &s;incere and pure, which will be in us a perpetual &s;pring of obedience, and a living principle of undefiled Religion.

The Word of God in|violably connects the Precepts and Promi&s;es, Duties and Ble&s;&s;ings. The latter are manife&s;tly and unalterably entail'd upon the former.&mdash; As to the Promi&s;e of <HI>Pardon</HI>; how evident is it, that we can never receive it, unle&s;s we have <HI>Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> a Faith <HI>which worketh by Love, and which purifyeth the heart?</HI>&mdash; Again, As to the Promi&s;e of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> if we wou'd obtain it, 'tis requir'd that we invite Him by Prayer, that we cheri&s;h His holy motions, con&s;pire with Him in our endeavours, and improve the Means.

To which I mu&s;t re|fer the Reader.</NOTE> and for <HI>particular</HI> Saints in times of danger or di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash; The Narratives of tho&s;e, and other things, which the Scriptures pre&s;ent us with, are very in&s;tructive and a mo&s;t profitable improvement may be made of them. They have a very propitious a&s;pect upon holy Living. They were written for our &s;piritual profit, &amp; are <HI>good to the u&s;e of edifying, to mini&s;ter Grace</HI> unto us. Thus the Apo&s;tle wit|ne&s;&s;es, (Rom. 15.4.) <HI>What&s;oever things were writ|ten aforetime, were written for our Learning.</HI> So, (1 Cor. 10.11.) <HI>All the&s;e things happen'd unto them for En&s;amples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</HI> And agreably we are told, (2 Pet. 2.6. &amp; Jude ver. 7.) That the Judgments executed on the wicked Sodomites <HI>are &s;et forth for an example unto tho&s;e that &s;hould after live ungodly.</HI> And on the other hand, the Apo&s;tle Paul tells us, (1 Tim. 1.16.) <HI>For this end I obtained mercy, that in me, the fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>chief</HI> Sinner, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t might &s;hew &s;orth all long-&s;uffering, for a pattern to them which &s;hould hereafter believe on Him.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. THE <HI>Examples</HI> of pure Religion, upon Scrip|ture-record have a clean&s;ing efficacy. Example is the mo&s;t powerful attractive to Practice. It affords &s;uperior Light to direct, and carries in it a pe|culiar charm to per&s;wade. Good Examples teach us our Duty with a much fuller empha&s;is, than bare Precepts. Example is mo&s;t compendious, mo&s;t plea&s;ant &amp; efficacious method of in&s;truction. It is mo&s;t informing and affecting. It &s;peaks mo&s;t
<PB N="156" REF="002024_0163_0FBA79B26AD020F8">
convincingly and &s;trikes us mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly. The holy Lives of the Saints are a &s;ilent and mo&s;t effectual reproof of Sinners, and greatly tend to cover them with &s;hame. And they are a liv|ing incentive to the Penitent; they tend to cheri&s;h their hopes, by repre&s;enting their Duty as practicable, &amp; they tend al&s;o to tempt their am|bition, &amp; provoke them to a laudable Emulation.</P>
<P>NOW the Word of God furni&s;hes us with the be&s;t and brighte&s;t Patterns of Holine&s;s. There is the grand Example of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which is eminently recommended to our regards. This is a mo&s;t <HI>perfect, full,</HI> and <HI>infallible</HI> Example, affording complete, univer&s;al and unerring di|rection.&mdash;And it is al&s;o mo&s;t <HI>obvious</HI> and <HI>fami|liar,</HI> excellently accommodated to our pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate, and to the different circum&s;tan|ces and capacities of Men, <HI>making our way &s;traight before our face, and leading us in a plain path.</HI>&mdash; And it is cloathed with &s;uch re&s;pects, as can't but powerfully per&s;wade us to imitation. 'Tis the Precedent of Him, who is our <HI>Sovereign</HI>; and carries a binding force with it, &amp; challen|ges our conformity thereunto as matter of <HI>Duty.</HI> Again, It is the Pre&s;ident of One, who is the <HI>Chief among Ten Thou&s;and</HI>; and invites us to &s;tudy a re&s;emblance from the motive of <HI>Honour.</HI> And moreover, 'Tis the Example of Him, who is our compa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Saviour, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the former nature of God, thought it not u&s;urpation to be al|together equal with God: but made him&s;elf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant; and being found in fa&s;hion as a Man, He humbled Him&s;elf and became obedient unto Death</HI>; &amp; this to <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> Heaven and Happine&s;s for us, (Sinners

and Enemies again&s;t Him,) and to <HI>leave us an Example,</HI> to lead us in the way thereunto. Now what an endearing and unparallel'd in&s;tance of Conde&s;cen&s;ion, Kindne&s;s and Mercy is here? And how &s;hou'd we be induced from the in|genuous principles of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Gratitude</HI> to fol|low the &s;teps, and imitate the virtues of our deare&s;t Friend, and mo&s;t generous Benefactor.</P>
<P>BUT further, be&s;ides the perfect Example of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> we have the Examples of the <HI>Saints</HI>; which tho' imperfect, yet are not &s;uper&s;eded by the former: But al&s;o have their &s;ingular u&s;e in the Chri&s;tian Life, even as the Stars are &s;ome|times <HI>profitable to direct</HI> as well as the Sun. Hence we are call'd upon, not only to <HI>look unto Je&s;us the author and fini&s;her of our Faith,</HI> and to <HI>con&s;ider Him:</HI> but al&s;o to be <HI>Followers of them who thro' faith and patience inherit the Promi&s;es.</HI> And indeed, tho' the Example of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in re&s;pect of it's perfect <HI>purity</HI> is more &s;ure to direct us: yet on &s;ome accounts the Examples of the <HI>Saints</HI> (they being <HI>Men of like pa&s;&s;ions with us,</HI> of like moral infirmities, and not only <HI>in all points tempted like as we are,</HI> even as Chri&s;t was, but al&s;o, as <HI>He</HI> was not, &s;ometimes overcome by the power of Temptations and <HI>overtaken with faults,</HI>) may &s;eem more &s;uited to encourage us. They &s;eem to come nearer, and to be more equal and level to us. And for this rea&s;on, The Lives of many Holy Men are written and regi&s;tred in the &s;acred Pages; And we are bidden to <HI>follow them as they followed Chri&s;t</HI>; to ob&s;erve their Vertues and take Example by them, as well as to ob&s;erve their Falls and take warning from them.</P>
<P>SO that, (we &s;ee) if there be any force in
<PB N="158" REF="002024_0165_0FBA79B5099093F0">
Example to tempt and allure us unto holy Liv|ing, the Word of God mu&s;t needs have a very powerful influence upon us.</P>
<P>THUS I've (in &s;ome mea&s;ure) made it appear, that the Word of God <HI>in it's own nature as a Means,</HI> is excellently fitted and greatly tends to purify our way: and have con&s;ider'd the whole Frame of the Word, and &s;hewn how all the parts of it do admirably con&s;pire and har|monize in promoting our Sanctification.&mdash; <HI>Which was the Second Thing.</HI> Pa&s;s we now to the La&s;t Particular, which is&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>THE Word is the cho&s;en In&s;trument of the Holy Spirit, and is ordinarily accompany'd with His Influence.</HI> The Word has a perfect natural con|gruity and aptitude, &amp; an in&s;trumental cau&s;ality, to clean&s;e and &s;anctify us. It has &s;o much and no more <HI>in it &s;elf.</HI> But <HI>over</HI> and <HI>above</HI> what virtue the Word carries in it's own nature ab|&s;tractly con&s;ider'd, there is an additional co|operating influence of the Divine Spirit. Indeed what Help we have by the Word it&s;elf is <HI>the fruit of the Spirit</HI>; but <HI>this</HI> is not <HI>the whole</HI> of the Spirit's influence in the work of Sanctification. Be&s;ides this, There is an internal agency of the Holy Spirit upon the Heart, a &s;ecret Divine Power, which accompanying the Word, gives life and efficacy thereunto.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>Common Grace,</HI> or general a&s;&s;i&s;t|ence of the Spirit, always attending the Word, and di&s;pen&s;ed to all, tho' not in an equal degree, and proportion, which has a tendency to Con|ver&s;ion, and is &s;ufficient to take off the idle pre|tence of <HI>&s;piritual impotence,</HI> and renders all tho&s;e
<PB N="159" REF="002024_0166_0FBA79B6DE790E50">
inexcu&s;able, that under the Go&s;pel remain carnal and di&s;obedient. Hence &s;uch are &s;aid to <HI>receive the Grace of God in vain,</HI> and <HI>to re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>AND there is a more <HI>Special Grace,</HI> or parti|cular A&s;&s;i&s;tence, accompanying the Word unto the Souls of &s;ome, <HI>which worketh effectually in them,</HI> and <HI>the&s;e</HI> are <HI>ordinarily</HI> &s;uch as have im|proved former and le&s;&s;er A&s;&s;i&s;tences. Tho&s;e who are humbly and diligently u&s;ing the Means, praying for the Spirit, concurring with His holy Motions, and abandoning their evil ways, it is the u&s;ual method of the Spirit, to derive unto them higher and more peculiar A&s;&s;i&s;tences, to <HI>create in them a clean heart,</HI> and <HI>make them Partakers of the Divine Nature,</HI> to <HI>make them perfect in every good work, to do the will of God, working in them that which is well plea&s;ing in his &s;ight.</HI> This is the &s;tanding method of the Spirit's proceeding with tho&s;e, who enjoy the Means of Grace, from which He doth not ordi|narily vary. Indeed "the Apo&s;tle Paul, before his Conver&s;ion, was &s;o far from being under any preparatory di&s;po&s;ition, that he was employing his &s;trength to de&s;troy the Faith of Chri&s;t, at that time, when he was effectually call'd by him". But this is an <HI>extraordinarry</HI> in&s;tance, to &s;hew the &s;overeignty and power of Divine Grace. And they that take encouragement from it to neglect and &s;light the u&s;e of Means, under a &s;hew of waiting for the Spirit, and do <HI>magnify</HI> this, and <HI>nullify</HI> that, are Men of &s;trange pre|&s;umption, and do ca&s;t a foul indignity on the wi&s;e appointments of Heaven, and offer violence to the e&s;tabli&s;ht method of Grace.&mdash;The Word and Spirit (in ordinary ca&s;es) have a concomi|tant,
<PB N="160" REF="002024_0167_0FBA79BD3383B6B0">
tho' not equal, Agency in our Conver&s;ion and Sanctification; The Spirit as the Efficient, the Word as the In&s;trument. The Spirit ordi|narily works <HI>by</HI> and <HI>with</HI> the Word. Hence, we find <HI>Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth</HI> put together, (2 The&s;. 2.13.) Hence, the Go&s;|pel is call'd, <HI>The Mini&s;tration of the Spirit, The Sword of the Spirit, The Law of the Spirit of Life, The Power of God unto Salvation.</HI> Hence, when the Go&s;pel comes <HI>in power,</HI> it is &s;aid to come <HI>in the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> (1 The&s;. 1.5.) Hence, The Saints are &s;aid to <HI>purify their Souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit,</HI> (1 Pet. 1.22.) and to be <HI>the Epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t, mini&s;tred by the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, writ|ten not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God</HI>; and <HI>beholding</HI> in the Word <HI>as in a gla&s;s the Glory of the Lord, to be changed into the &s;ame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</HI> (1 Cor. 3.3, 18.) Hence, The Apo&s;tle makes that appeal to the Galatians, <HI>Received ye the Spi|rit</HI> by the works of the Law, or <HI>by the hearing of Faith?</HI> (Gal. 3.2.)&mdash;The&s;e Scriptures make it &s;ufficiently evident, that the Word is the ordi|nary in&s;trument of the &s;anctifying Spirit, and accompany'd with His &s;acred Pre&s;ence. It is the Chariot in which He rides forth conquering and to conquer; The Wings, by which He de&s;cends into the Soul; the Channel in which He conveys the waters of Purification. And we have a gra|cious Promi&s;e, (<HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 59.21.) that the Word and Spirit &s;hall always be concomitant.</P>
<P>THUS I've &s;omewhat largely Di&s;cours'd on the <HI>Fir&s;t Article</HI> propos'd to con&s;ideration, which was, that <HI>The Word of God has a clean&s;ing influ|ence.</HI> I proceed now to &s;ay &s;omething very briefly to&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="002024_0168_0FBA79C658CAAA18">Artic. II. Which is this; namely, <HI>IF we take heed to the Word of God, we &s;hall experience it's clean&s;ing efficacy.</HI></P>
<P>HERE I might premi&s;e; That, If ever we ex|pect the Word of God &s;hou'd clean&s;e us, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily <HI>take heed</HI> unto it. The Word indeed is a means of Sanctification, &amp; a mo&s;t fit &amp; powerful means; but we can never reap any &s;aving benefit from it, without a due regard to it, &amp; improvement of it. Therefore the Young Man in order to <HI>clean&s;e his way,</HI> is directed in our Text, to <HI>take heed</HI> to the Word of God. We mu&s;t <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> it <HI>&s;trictly,</HI> as the Original imports. We mu&s;t carefully <HI>mark it, and &s;et our heart to it.</HI> We mu&s;t <HI>&s;earch the Scriptures</HI> for knowlege, as for <HI>precious &s;ub|&s;tance,</HI> and mu&s;t <HI>hide it in our hearts,</HI> and there pre|&s;erve it as a Trea&s;ure. We mu&s;t <HI>incline our ear to wi&s;dom and apply our heart to under&s;tanding.</HI> We mu&s;t <HI>meditate in the Law of God day and night,</HI> and <HI>have re&s;pect to all his ways.</HI> We mu&s;t receive and reverence the Word, <HI>as the Word of God:</HI> We mu&s;t acknowledge it's authority, yield our &s;elves up to the power, and acquaint our &s;elves with the contents of it. We mu&s;t be much in con|ver&s;ing with the <HI>Word Written,</HI> and frequent in attending on the <HI>Word Preacht:</HI> We mu&s;t <HI>take heed</HI> al&s;o <HI>how we hear</HI> and how we read.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t take heed to the <HI>Truths</HI> of the Word, as the Standard of our Faith, and <HI>hold fa&s;t the form of &s;ound words, in &s;aith and love which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> So likewi&s;e we mu&s;t take heed to the <HI>Precepts</HI> of the Word, as the Directory of our practice, and ob&s;erve them as Sailors do the Compa&s;s whereby they &s;teer; We mu&s;t inform our &s;elves of the Rule, and conform our &s;elves

unto it. Again, We mu&s;t take heed to the <HI>Threatnings,</HI> to learn our danger and quicken us to avoid it, as the Traveller is circum&s;pect and careful to &s;py and &s;hun Praecipes, Sloughs and By-paths. Again, We mu&s;t take heed to the <HI>Pro|mi&s;es,</HI> to learn our happine&s;s, and animate us to pur&s;ue it, as the Racer locks to the Prize that is &s;et before him: And further, we mu&s;t take heed to the <HI>Examples</HI> in the Word to imitate them, as a <HI>Painter</HI> looks on the Object, as the Writer ob&s;erves his Copy, or the Workman his Pattern. <HI>In &s;hort,</HI> We mu&s;t take heed to the <HI>whole</HI> Word of God. We mu&s;t <HI>&s;et our hearts to all things what&s;oever it te&s;tifies unto us,</HI> (Deut. 32.46.)</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t take heed to the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> and <HI>U&s;e</HI> of the holy Word, keep that in our eye, affect our hearts with it, and always u&s;e the <HI>means</HI> with &s;erious views to the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, We mu&s;t take heed to the <HI>Spi|rit,</HI> by who&s;e In&s;piration the Word was written, and by who&s;e Ble&s;&s;ing it is &s;ucceeded; we mu&s;t realize the nece&s;&s;ity of His pre&s;ence with the Word, we mu&s;t implore His &s;pecial Influence to accompany it, rely on His powerful Grace to render it efficacious, lay our Souls open there|unto, ob&s;erve His workings in us, cheri&s;h con|victions, and improve every good impre&s;&s;ion He makes on us by the Word at any time.</P>
<P>AND if we thus take heed to the Word, we &s;hall find it an <HI>effectual</HI> method to clean&s;e our way. This Truth is evident as from other Con|&s;iderations, &s;o e&s;pecially from <HI>the Promi&s;e of God,</HI> and <HI>the Experience of the Saints.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> is unto &s;uch. Thus we read, (1 Jam. 1.25.) <HI>Who&s;o looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
<PB N="163" REF="002024_0170_0FBA79CB75E9A2C0">
therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in his deed.</HI> So, (Mar. 4.24.) <HI>Take heed to what ye hear: And unto you that hear &s;hall more be given.</HI> So (I&s;ai. 55.1.) <HI>Hear, and your Soul &s;hall live.</HI> &mdash; The&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Promi&s;es unto tho&s;e that hear, or ob|&s;erve and take heed to the Word, are a &s;ufficient ground of a&s;&s;urance, that &s;uch &s;hall not <HI>fail of the Grace of God.</HI>&mdash; And the univer&s;al <HI>Expe|rience</HI> of the <HI>Saints</HI> is an abundant confirmation of this Truth. 'Twas in this way they all <HI>e&s;caped the pollutions of the world</HI>; they <HI>purify'd their Souls in obeying the Truth.</HI> To which of the Saints wilt thou turn? If we appeal to <HI>the Saints in Light,</HI> they will with one voice tell us, that <HI>by ob&s;erving the Word of God</HI> they were <HI>made meet</HI> for their Inheritance. If we enquire of <HI>the Saints that are in the Earth,</HI> they will pro|fe&s;s with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>By the Word I have kept me from the paths of the de&s;troyer. The Word have I hid in my heart that I might not &s;in again&s;t God. Salvation is far from the wicked, for they &s;eek not his &s;tatutes. But my heart &s;tandeth in awe of his word. I have hoped for his &s;alvation and done his commandments. I will never forget his precepts, for his word hath quicken'd me. I will walk at liberty, for I &s;eek his precepts.</HI></P>
<P>OBSERVING the Word is then a mo&s;t &s;ure and infallible method of clean&s;ing. <HI>The Word of the Lord is try'd.</HI> It is a means, that never <HI>has</HI> fail'd &s;uch as have diligently improv'd it; and this is &s;ufficient Argument, <HI>it never will.</HI> And <HI>as many as take heed unto the Word of God,</HI> mu&s;t needs be <HI>undefiled in the way,</HI> and <HI>al&s;o do no ini|quity.

<P>THESE few Hints may &s;uffice for this La&s;t Article.</P>
<P>AND thus I've fini&s;ht the <HI>Doctrinal</HI> Handling of the Text, and in &s;ome &s;ort cleared the Three Points propos'd to be &s;poken to; Namely, <HI>That the way of Youth is naturally defiled: That it great|ly concerns Per&s;ons in their Youth to get their way Clean&s;ed:</HI> And La&s;tly, <HI>That if Young Men</HI> (or any others) <HI>duly ob&s;erve the Word of God, they take a mo&s;t direct and effectual method to clean&s;e, and keep, their way from &s;inful defilements.</HI></P>
<P>AND now I proceed to make &s;ome brief APPLICATION of the&s;e Things di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>USE. I. IS the way of Youth defiled, <HI>What ground of Self-aba&s;ement is here?</HI> How &s;hould this &s;hame and humble us? How &s;hou'd it correct the vanity and mortify the levity of Young Men, to con&s;ider their <HI>natural depravation &amp; contracted defilements?</HI> Con&s;ider this, ye that forget God; and <HI>Be not high-minded, but be ye clothed with hu|mility.</HI> Pride not your &s;elves in any Privileges of Birth or Education, in any accompli&s;hments of Body or Mind, in any temporal enjoyments or external advantages of Life, and the like; for &s;o long as your <HI>way is defiled,</HI> this tarni&s;hes the glory of all, and &s;heds a fatal taint into all the Ble&s;&s;ing you enjoy, renders your Per&s;ons odious in the Eyes of the Holy God, and expo&s;es you to all the Cur&s;es which His infinite Wi&s;dom can invent, or His infinite Power inflict, <HI>which is &s;hame and terror enough.</HI> It is owing to igno|rance
<PB N="165" REF="002024_0172_0FBA79CF466FE748">
and incon&s;ideration of the&s;e things, that &s;o many Young Men, as well as others, are <HI>vainly p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fft up by their fle&s;hly mind,</HI> and walk in the lu&s;t of <HI>Pride.</HI> They wou'd rate Them&s;elves and their Accompli&s;hments a little lower, did they but con&s;ider what black &amp; filthy feet the&s;e proud Plumes walk upon; or what roots of bitterne&s;s they are, which bear the&s;e gawdy flowers, what corrupt Trees they are, which bear the&s;e painted fruits. Our original Corruption and actual Pol|lutions are &s;ufficient matter of humiliation to us, and a ju&s;t allay of &s;welling arrogance. We may well bemoan our &s;elves as <HI>wretched Men,</HI> 'till we are <HI>deliver'd from the Body of this Death,</HI> however happy we may be as to Bodily or Men|tal Endowments, or Worldly Enjoyments. And we &s;hould temper the tho'ts of the one, by &s;ui|table reflections on the other, to make us lowly in our own Eyes, and to keep us from <HI>thinking more highly of our &s;elves, than we ought to think.</HI></P>

'Tis the greate&s;t outward Privilege. The Apo&s;tle declares the <HI>Jews</HI> of old had <HI>manifold peculiar Advantages</HI> in the enjoyment of the Divine Ora|cles. (Rom. 3.1, 2.)
