<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I &s;at down to collect the particulars of the fol|lowing work, the uncommon &s;ucce&s;s of which &s;timulates me to a continu|ation, which will be ready for my numerous readers in a &s;hort time, I examined every character introduced with the equitable eye of ju&s;tice. When I exhibited them to the in|&s;pection of tho&s;e powerful members of &s;ociety, Genius and Friend&s;hip, I was led to think the colouring beau|tiful, and the execution every way characteri&s;tically ju&s;t. Since then it
<PB N="iv" REF="017808_0003_0FA319CAC3C4E3B8">
has found its way to the public tri|bunal, where the former illu&s;trious character will pay no attention to the magic eloquence of the latter.&mdash; I have been told my &s;trictures on Mr. Garrick are beneath the pen that ex|ecuted the foregoing part of the work: to this it would be idle to pay any attention, while my a&s;&s;ertions are founded in truth. &mdash; If tho&s;e elevated admirers of Mr. G. who will not think him any other than the paragon of perfection, while his great pow|ers ennobled the dramatic mu&s;e, will take the trouble of &s;crutinizing his conduct, as Manager and Dramatic Reviewer, and leave hu&s;band, bro|ther, friend, out of the que&s;tion, they will not think me dive&s;ted of feeling, nor brand me as the di&s;tur|ber
<PB N="v" REF="017808_0004_0FA319CB85C4FD60">
of his renowned manes. Mr. Garrick's dramatic fame I bow down to with as much reverence, as the warme&s;t idolater at his &s;hrine; but dete&s;t with the majority of mankind, his par&s;imonious principles; nor will I think the gift of two guineas to the be&s;t pa&s;toral poet of this age, nor the beque&s;t of a rotten building to his veteran brothers of the &s;ock and bu&s;|kin, monuments of benevolence, and of a &s;oul of extraordinary feeling.&mdash; I looked for the be&s;t information in the delineation of every character, and the general voice told me I found it.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure the candid reader, a de|generacy of &s;oul I have been ever a &s;tranger to; and though I do not
<PB N="vi" REF="017808_0005_0FA319CC458FC460">
expect to die worth a hundred thou|&s;and pounds, I am not hopele&s;s that my grave will not be honoured with the tear of friend&s;hip, as warm and &s;incerely flowing, as if I had died the fir&s;t favourite of Plutus.</P>

<HEAD>ORIGIN.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS made by a di&s;tingui&s;hed Coach-maker, of Great Queen|&s;treet, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, for Mr. M&mdash;, a very worthy merchant in Thread-needle-&s;treet, who acquired a con&s;iderable property, by an early and inten&s;e application to commercial bu|&s;ine&s;s. He had as great a &s;ore&s;ight of future events as mo&s;t &s;peculative men; could decypher a man of &s;mall capital and great appearance, whom he ge|nerally called a cracker; &s;hook hands with the fir&s;t merchants on the Royal Exchange, and was ever foremo&s;t in all their cabinet councils. As he had
<PB N="5" REF="017808_0014_0FA319D3057D1EF0">
a ri&s;ing family he was circum&s;pect even in trifles; &s;tudied little el&s;e than how to acquire a provi&s;ion to &s;hield them from the winter of adver&s;ity. Notwith&s;tanding all this &s;agacity, he tru&s;ted as much to appearances, where riches centered, as his unthinking neighbours; and by the failure of that plunderer F&mdash;e, this laborious &s;on of indu&s;try, and his darling family, were bereft of the hone&s;t harve&s;t of many toiling years. At the time of this national calamity, I was at his little villa at Clapham Common, with his wife and children, who mostly re&s;ided there.</P>
<P>When Rumour, the harbinger of the&s;e dreadful tidings arrived, the ge|nius of mi&s;ery only could expre&s;s the horror that ran through the family; which was &s;carcely felt, before the
<PB N="6" REF="017808_0015_0FA319D3C3C8F2C8">
unfortunate wreck him&s;elf arrived with the confirmation.</P>
<P>He entered the back part of his garden and retired to an arbour, where he and his little family u&s;ed often to a&s;&s;emble&mdash;to hide the bitter|ne&s;s of his affliction.</P>
<P>He did not remain long in this &s;i|tuation, when his wife and children came to pour the balm of con&s;olation into his bleeding bo&s;om. His elde&s;t daughter, with &s;urpri&s;ing fortitude &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her angui&s;h, while &s;he be|gan to cha&s;e from his tortured ima|gination, the approaching &s;pirit of de&s;pair.</P>
<P><Q>You know my dear Papa,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, with the endearing tenderne&s;s of youthful affection, <Q>when Lady No|table did us the honor of a vi&s;it la&s;t, how very much &s;he admired my em|broidery, placed it in as flattering a

<P><Q>There is no fear, between my brother and I, but we will realize &s;omething to begin the world anew.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>This little villa belongs to my uncle, who often told me we &s;hould re&s;ide here, if we wanted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he too will be generous; for you know he calls my Mamma his darling &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>

<P>A few days after I was driven to the coachmakers, where I was made but two months before; who told my ma&s;ter he would &s;ettle with him next morning; when he generou&s;ly re|turned the original price.</P>
<P>I did not remain long in this &s;itu|ation, when I was purcha&s;ed by a Hackney-man, of Oxford-&s;treet; who had me numbered and &s;ent to his &s;tand next day in Piccadilly.</P>

train: It brings to my recollection &s;ome pretty lines I once met in a poem but little known, written in compli|ment to General WOLFE, on the con|que&s;t of Quebec; and may very pro|perly be introduced here:
<Q><L>To the &s;hrill numbers of the martial fife</L>

<L>Firm virtue and united vigour;&mdash; he</L>

Methinks I &s;ee thee, bli&s;sful Spirit! with a branch from thy palm of victory binding his youthful brows! hear thee tell him, when his country calls to remember thy un&s;haken loy|alty and victorious fame; the &s;oldiers view him with paternal fondne&s;s tra|cing delighted in his youthful coun|tenance the lines of valor and huma|nity!

<P>IT was one of tho&s;e cheerle&s;s morn|ings, when the &s;un withdrew his enlivening beams from the heavy at|mo&s;phere

of London, that I was or|dered out very early to attend the fu|neral of an officer belonging to a re|giment in America; who died at his father's in We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>My company con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome of his mo&s;t affectionate companions, who were a&s;&s;embled to pay the la&s;t &s;ad tri|bute to their departed friend. This te&s;timony of friend&s;hip to &s;urvivors is a plea&s;ing momento of indubitable &s;incerity, notwith&s;tanding what the children of di&s;appointment may a&s;|&s;ert to the contrary.</P>
<P>Their di&s;cour&s;e chiefly turned on the many virtues of the decea&s;ed: His convivial di&s;po&s;ition; amiable fidelity; and above all, the affection he bore his faithful nur&s;e; who&s;e husband was one of the unfortunate &s;oldiers that fell at the battle of Bunkers-Hill; his al|lowing her &s;ix-pence a-day out of his

She was dre&s;t in deep mourning, with her window open.&mdash; &s;he rai&s;ed her &s;wimming eyes to hea|ven; and as &s;he clo&s;ed them the pa&s;&s;ing breeze bore from their heavy lids a tear&mdash;and drop't it on the coffin.</P>
<P>During the momentary intervals from grief, &s;he re&s;ted her eyes on the hear&s;e, till it was out of &s;ight; then &s;at down in the window &s;eat and wept bitterly.</P>
<P>"This lovely woman's connection with Charles," continued he, "may not be &s;o well known as it &s;hould be; and as I had the happine&s;s of a clo&s;er

intimacy with them both, than mo&s;t others, I &s;hall relate it.</P>
<P>"This excellent young Lady is the daughter of a Baronet in the We&s;t of England, who died &s;ome few months ago, leaving her, at her own di&s;po&s;al a fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds. In a village near her re&s;idence Charles was brought up, under the in&s;pection of his grandfather, an officer on half pay, who retired to his rural a&s;ylum after many hard&s;hips, and little el&s;e to &s;olace old age, than a heart of in|tegrity.</P>
<P>"Charles was the favourite of this veteran; he infu&s;ed in him the virtues of the &s;oldier and the man. The fa|ther of the youth, ob&s;erving the won|derful progre&s;s he was making, was re&s;olved, though dear his company was to him, to let him remain with his excellent preceptor, till he was every thing he could wi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="017808_0026_0FA319DC04235B50">"In this retirement he lived till he was eighteen years old, the delight of every companion and the lover of the beauteous Theodora! The war-worn Hero was a con&s;tant vi&s;itor at the Ba|ronet's, always accompanied by his pupil.</P>
<P>"Theodora and her maid u&s;ed fre|quently to meet them in a pathway that led from her hou&s;e to the village; and by that means had an opportunity of indulging her&s;elf with the conver&s;ation of her favourite Charles.</P>
<P>"They generally let the old Gran|by go up the avenue, while they walk|ed through that part of the deme&s;ne that led to the back part of the hou&s;e. Every one of the&s;e excur&s;ions was con|&s;idered by them both as the height of human felicity; how delicious was her winning conver&s;e to the happy

<P>"Charles, ere his bli&s;&s;es were ta&s;ted by &s;ome fortunate rival, was deter|mined in one of tho&s;e walks to unbo|&s;om him&s;elf to Theodora. She li&s;tened to him with the attention his virtues merited; told him to wait till next morning, and he &s;hould have her an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"Ere he was yet ri&s;en from his fan|ciful embraces of Theodora, her maid and confidante was di&s;patched with the following &s;hort letter to him:</P>

<P>"This terminated as poor Charles's fears foreboded; the connection was broke between them; the old officer cea&s;ed to vi&s;it the Baronet, and Charles had only a few mutual glances at church every Sunday to comfort him; and an ardent letter now and then, which was left in a box-tree for him by the haple&s;s Theodora.</P>

You are ac|quainted with the re&s;t of the &s;tory.</P>
<P>"Three years have elap&s;ed &s;ince he left the la&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate ki&s;s upon Theo|dora's lips; he was every thing in the field his brave preceptor was anxious for, valiant and enterprizing. But who can turn a&s;ide the &s;haft of adver&s;e fortune? he was wounded at the head of a &s;couting party, but not mortally.</P>

<P>"When he had a re&s;pite from his angui&s;h, &s;o as to be able to &s;it up, &s;he would read by him, or tell &s;ome &s;oothing tale. But alas! the dreadful herald of her grief arrived and de|&s;troyed the pro&s;pect of her future fe|licity; his wound turned to a morti|fication, which deprived him of his life; and left his family incon&s;olable, and his lover in a &s;tate of phrenzy."</P>

<HEAD>THE WEDDING.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS engaged a few days after to go to We&s;tham in E&s;&s;ex, by an af|fectionate couple who were de&s;irous of ta&s;ting the joys in&s;eparable from wed|ded love. The bride was one of tho&s;e captivating ve&s;tals that win upon the affections rather than enchant the eye; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that agreeable &s;omething, to be &s;een beautifully dre&s;t in that ad|mired actre&s;s, Mi&s;s Brown, of Covent-garden theatre; but not in Mrs. Hart|ley, who is a Venus de Medicis.</P>
<P>She was accompanied by two agree|able females in neat habiliments; the bridegroom had one attendant and the
<PB N="23" REF="017808_0032_0FA319E085B9DDB8">
bride's father, who was a widower, was the la&s;t who took a &s;eat with this happy a&s;&s;emblage.</P>
<P>Our journey was very plea&s;ant; the young folks of the village, who had timely information of this event, were prepared with the &s;weets of the &s;ea&s;on made up in various forms. When the bride was handed out, &s;he was pre|&s;ented with a hand&s;ome bouquet, by a comely youth; while the bride|groom received the like favour from a &s;prightly la&s;s with the countenance of Hygaeia.</P>
<P>Six feemale villagers in&s;tantly &s;tep|ped from the throng, &s;trewing the way with flowers till they were in the church.</P>
<P>As they returned from the altar, they were pre&s;ented with a chaplet of flowers, which they were reque&s;ted to pre&s;erve, while it remained together,

as a te&s;timony of the felicity they wi&s;hed them.</P>
<P>The bridegroom was not behind hand in acknowledging the honor they did him, he gave them five guineas, which made them as happy as their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>We drove to Wan&s;tead, where the bride's father had a villa. "I cannot divine, my dear Amelia," &s;ays her father, "what makes you &s;o dull this morning, you were all cheerfulne&s;s ye&s;terday?" Indeed, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, "I cannot account for it, it ari&s;es from no cau&s;e of di&s;plea&s;ure; you have married me to the man I love, and I will ever retain a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of your goodne&s;s; there are hours when this languor of the mind will not &s;uffer us to think or &s;peak; they are winged with melan|choly on the nuptial morn of every rational woman."</P>
