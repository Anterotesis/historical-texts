<P>With all the Chri&s;tian Charities mo&s;t affectionately beloved! Give ear, I be&s;eech you, to the wi&s;e coun&s;el of the Elde&s;t of Apo&s;tles, who hath directed our attention to the more &s;ure word of prophecy, whereunto we do well, that we take heed, as unto a light that &s;hineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day &s;tar ari&s;e in our hearts: And this word, which came not in old time by the will of Man, but was &s;poken by Holy Men of God, who &s;pake as they were moved of the Holy Spirit, hath te&s;tified before hand, on this wi&s;e, in the 31&s;t Chapter of JEREMIAH and the 6th Ver&s;e.</P>
<Q>&mdash;THERE SHALL BE A DAY, THAT THE WATCHMEN UPON THE MOUNT EPHRAIM, SHALL CRY, ARISE YE, LET US GO UP TO ZION UNTO THE LORD OUR GOD.</Q>
<BIBL>31&s;t JEREMIAH, 6th Ver&s;e.</BIBL>
<P>AND was there a day, when the Watchmen of Ephraim which is I&s;rael, did cry, and in the language of antecedent prophecy, &s;ay, ari&s;e ye, let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God? Yes, verily, there was; and of this day, emphatically, it may be &s;aid, as David &s;pake in ancient time, behold, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> which the Lord hath made, let us rejoice therein, and be glad with exceeding great joy.&mdash;Indeed, it is the day of days, anointed with the oil of glad|ne&s;s above its fellows, and infinitely more glo|rious than the day of creation, when the morn|ing

&s;tars &s;ang together, and all the fir&s;t born &s;ons of immortality &s;houted loud for joy. To this day, the day that we are now a&s;&s;embled to ce|lebrate, the day of the advent of Shiloh, Im|manuel, God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, our general progenitors looked forward through an eye of faith, and wor&s;hipping the Bruizer of the Ser|pent's head, as they leaned on the Staff of Hope, a better and a more enduring Paradi&s;e, than that of Eden pre&s;ented to view.&mdash;This, al&s;o, was the day which Abraham and his fel|low heirs of the &s;ame promi&s;e, beheld afar off, as in the vi&s;ions of the Almighty, and rejoiced in &s;pirit to &s;ee, although at two thou&s;and years di&s;tance; for the &s;olemnity of an oath and the immutability of Jehovah had not only promi&s;ed, but on this day, more abundantly confirmed, all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly places, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Saviour of the World, to all the Na|tions of the Earth.&mdash;Nor did the Patriarchs, who by faith have obtained a good report, alone bear te&s;timony to the dawn of the day &s;pring from on high. &mdash;The Law which came by Mo&s;es, as the appointed &s;hadow of good things to come, was reflected from the body of Je&s;us,

full of grace and of truth; and all that was made according to the pattern &s;hewed on Mount Sinai, exhibited in lively figures, the eternal purpo&s;e purpo&s;ed in Chri&s;t, of whom the whole family in Heaven and in Earth is named.&mdash;A|nother, and a far greater cloud of witne&s;&s;es en|compa&s;s us around: They are rai&s;ed up from their beds where they lie in glory, and being dead, they yet &s;peak in the name of the Lord: The&s;e are the Prophets, who diligently enquir|ed concerning &s;o great Salvation, and prophe|&s;ied of the exceeding abundance of the riches of Grace, which from before the World began, was hid with Chri&s;t in God. The &s;pirit of all prophecy is the te&s;timony of Je&s;us, the Won|derful, the Coun&s;ellor, the Everla&s;ting Father, the Prince of Peace; and the pens of the&s;e ready writers have noted in the Scriptures of truth, the birth, the life, the &s;ufferings and the con&s;equent glory of Me&s;&s;iah. How beautiful, ye Watchmen of Mount Ephraim, encompa&s;&s;ing the walls of Jeru&s;alem, were your foot&s;teps in every intermediate age! Yours, in truth, were the feet of them, who brought good tidings of good, glad tidings of great joy, being &s;hod with

<P>Amid this illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly of glorified El|ders, there appeareth One, divinely exalted above his fellow &s;ervants. Lo, he de&s;cendeth on the out&s;tretched pinions of love: His gar|ments are light, reflecting light caele&s;tial: It is Gabriel, who &s;tandeth in the pre&s;ence of God: Welcome, thrice welcome, all hail, thou Angel of the Lord: Thou come&s;t as a mini&s;tering Spirit, mini&s;tering unto Salvation's heirs: We know thee, who thou art, the highly favored of the mo&s;t Highe&s;t: It was thine, to admini&s;ter tho&s;e con&s;olations which are neither &s;mall nor few, to the Man greatly beloved in ancient days: It was thine to gladden the heart of Zacharias, as wor&s;hipping on the right &s;ide of the Altar of incen&s;e: It was thine to announce the ri&s;ing of the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to the virgin daughter of the humble&s;t tribe amid

<P>And did the four Spirits of the living God, who re&s;t not day nor night, from prai&s;e, keep jubilee on this au&s;picious morn?

of the Prodigal, an&s;wer aloud, I will ari&s;e and go up to my Father's hou&s;e. At a moment like this, the world and its fa&s;hion which are pa&s;|&s;ing away &s;hould have no charms. At an hour like the pre&s;ent, the lu&s;t of ambition, the love of Mammon, and the ze&s;t for plea&s;ures fal&s;ely &s;o called, ought to be extingui&s;hed, and the whole man, in body, in &s;pirit and in &s;oul, alive only unto God. For this is the fulne&s;s of time, which Angels from everla&s;ting girded up the loins of their minds, with &s;obriety, &s;tedfa&s;tly to gaze upon: And the bringing in of the Fir&s;t Begotten into the world, &s;hall henceforth be ce|lebrated in the many man&s;ions of eternity, by the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t already perfected, and the general a&s;&s;embly delivered from great tribu|lation.

Who is the Patriarch, of whom it is written, I will be to him a Father and he &s;hall be to me a Son? To which of the Prophets, is it &s;poken, &s;it thou on the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high?

It is the Lord your Creator, the Creator of all things, whether vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible, without whom no|thing was made, that is made, who is found in fa&s;hion as an infant: It is He who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God, and in whom the fulne&s;s of the God|head dwelleth bodily, who hath put on&punc; the &s;imilitude of a babe: It is He, who&s;e gracious providence extends from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, to the chambers of the we&s;t; who&s;e domin|ion ruleth over all, from the Mini&s;tring Spirit of the inner court, to the little &s;parrow ne&s;tling on his altar, who hath a&s;&s;umed the likene&s;s of a child. &mdash;The glorified with glory before all worlds were, &s;aw there was no man: The Alpha, the Omega wondered there was no in|terce&s;&s;or: The beginning, the ending, the Al|mighty looked, there was none to help: The Lord, who was, who is, and who is to come, beheld, and there was none to uphold: He therefore took upon him&s;elf the &s;eed of Abra|ham; and in as much, as the children were par|takers

No marvel indeed, that I&s;rael's &s;weet P&s;almi&s;t exclaimed, Lord, what is Man that thou art &s;o mindful of him, or the &s;on of man that he is vi&s;ited thus? No wonder in truth, that the Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles copied the words of the Royal Writer, when Je&s;us appear|ed a little lower than the Angels of his power, and being made perfect in the &s;ufferings of death, worked out the far more exceeding and eternal weight of Salvation.</P>

Remember, I in|treat thee, that a frequent recurrence to the example of thy Lord, a con&s;tant imitation of his mo&s;t holy pattern, is the be&s;t pre&s;ervative from error, the &s;ure&s;t &s;afe-guard from vice, and keep|eth in &s;afety from the great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, when the pul&s;es beat quick, the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ound an a|larm, and temptations pre&s;s; whil&s;t ambition flatters, mammon &s;preads the gilded bait, and plea&s;ure points her &s;erpent-&s;ting.</P>
<P>Ye Watchmen, on the watch towers of Beth|lehem Ephratah, what remaineth to be added?
<PB N="40" REF="029410_0039_0FE1728C01235608">
See, that ye refu&s;e not him who &s;peaketh from heaven, is their united an&s;wer. A voice from the Mo&s;t Excellent Glory hath declared, this is my beloved Son, hear him. Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath graciou&s;ly &s;ummed up the Law and the Prophets in four comprehen&s;ive words, love God, love Man: The&s;e two commandments are not griev|ous: They connect duty with intere&s;t, and in|tere&s;t with happine&s;s. To love our Creator, Pre&s;erver, Redeemer and Saviour, is the re|quirement of a rea&s;onable &s;ervice. To love our brethren, is in&s;cribed upon the tablet of every heart, as with the pen of a diamond: But the chri&s;tian ought not to bound his af|fections in the hou&s;e of his friends. Our ene|mies are to be loved with all fervor of charity. The love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us thus to judge; and his precept hath enjoined it as a duty, which is founded on his own example. Give ye therefore all diligence to add unto your faith, virtue, and to virtue, knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance, and to temperance, godline&s;s, and to godline&s;s, brotherly kindne&s;s, and to brotherly kindne&s;s, love, even the love of friends and of enemies, which is the fulfilling of the Royal Law, and the bond of perfectne&s;s in heaven above and in earth beneath.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="029410_0040_0FE172902A296D30">It is time, that we attempt to improve the &s;ubject before us, by a few pertinent reflexions, adapted to mutual edification.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Apo&s;tle, writing unto the Hebrews, having &s;et forth the dignity of the Ju&s;t God and the Saviour, hath exhorted, that we give the more earne&s;t heed unto the things which we have heard, le&s;t at any time we let them &s;lip. The neglecting of &s;o great &s;alvation, which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord in Paradi&s;e, and hath been confirmed unto us, by the united te&s;timony of Patriarchs, Pro|phets, and Evangeli&s;ts, with the trump of the Archangel, and the voice of the whole Ho&s;t of Heaven, will a&s;&s;uredly meet with a due recom|pence of reward, for if he, who de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es' law was put to death, by the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es, of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment, &s;hall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, crucified him afre&s;h, and put him to an open &s;hame. The &s;pirit of a man will &s;u&s;tain his infirmities, but a wounded &s;pirit who can bear? Believe ye, therefore, in the Lord your God, &s;o &s;hall ye be e&s;tabli&s;hed;
<PB N="42" REF="029410_0041_0FE17291B2AC7150">
believe in his Prophets, &s;o &s;hall ye pro&s;per. Without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God. The fellow pilgrims, and &s;ojourners in this vale of tears, who were gathered unto their fathers, before Chri&s;t came in the fle&s;h, went on their way, rejoicing in the hope that was &s;et before them, beholding the fulfilment of the promi&s;es afar off, and being per&s;uaded that He who had promi&s;ed was al&s;o faithful to perform, their faith was accounted unto them for righteou&s;|ne&s;s. God hath graciou&s;ly provided &s;ome better thing for us. We have heard with our ears, we have &s;een with our eyes, we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life. Tho&s;e, upon whom the ends of the world, are come, mu&s;t be, of all men mo&s;t in|excu&s;able, if they clo&s;e their eyes again&s;t the clear &s;hining of the true light, turn a deaf ear to the Charmer ever charming wi&s;ely, and op|po&s;e a heart of adamant again&s;t the Lord Chri&s;t. Let us, therefore, earne&s;tly pray, that we may be delivered from the &s;in of unbelief, which doth &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;et, and run with pa|tience the race that is &s;et before us, looking unto Je&s;us the author, and the fini&s;her of faith,
<PB N="43" REF="029410_0042_0FE16F0623FFE588">
and thus ca&s;t anchor within the vail, whither the Forerunner hath for us entered.</P>
<P N="2">II. At all times and in all places, it would be our wi&s;dom, to remember the years of the right hand of the Mo&s;t High; his wonderful works from the days of old: The heavens which declare his glory, and the firmament &s;hewing forth his handy work, are witne&s;&s;es on behalf of the Almighty, in every land, and their &s;ilent language is worthy of being heard among all nations; for, the invi&s;ible things of God are hereby clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God Head: But nei|ther Creation, in all its multiplied wonders, nor Providence, which is arrayed in greater glo|ries than Creation, &s;o fully reveal the nature of the Divine Being, or &s;o clearly demon&s;trate his attributes, as the eternal purpo&s;e of grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us from before the world began: On this, the noble&s;t work of God, the corner &s;tone of time was laid; and the top &s;tone brought forth in eternity with &s;houting, &s;hall cry grace, grace unto it. In truth, this fir&s;t,
<PB N="44" REF="029410_0043_0FE17295F0CAB518">
la&s;t, fini&s;hed work, hath a claim to our con&s;tant remembrance. It de&s;erveth to be had in me|morial, when we lie down, what time we ari&s;e, whether we wake, or &s;leep, or live, or die: For, for this cau&s;e, Chri&s;t Je&s;us both died and ro&s;e, and revived again, that henceforth we &s;hould not live unto our&s;elves, but live unto him, who &s;o loved us, that he gave him&s;elf for our &s;ins, that we might be delivered from this pre&s;ent evil world, and tran&s;lated from the kingdom of darkne&s;s, to an inheritance incor|ruptible, undefiled and that fadeth not away.</P>
<P N="3">III. Chri&s;t Je&s;us, our Lord, is not only worthy of being had in reverence, becau&s;e of his wonderful works in Creation, Provi|dence, Redemption and Salvation: But the beauty of his all perfect example ought to be devoutly contemplated at evening, at morning and at noon. As the Father Everla&s;ting, who of one blood hath made all nations, who dwell together upon the face of the whole earth, how richly hath he provided for the food, the habi|tation and the cloathing of his offspring! In the character of a Son, what &s;trength of filial
<PB N="45" REF="029410_0044_0FE17297F6FACC70">
affection, gratitude, obedience and love! The ble&s;&s;ed among women, was tenderly thought of in the la&s;t moments of life: His addre&s;s on her behalf, to the beloved Di&s;ciple, when treading the winepre&s;s alone, and ta&s;ting the bitterne&s;s of death, is &s;o exqui&s;itely affecting, that even to read it without tears, would argue the ex|treme&s;t in&s;en&s;ibility. In brief, amid all the en|dearing, the much loved relations of life, as a Parent, a Brother, a Friend, Je&s;us &s;tandeth greatly preheminent; and the word of the Sa|viour, energetically heard in his example, is, Go thou and do likewi&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The new commandment whereunto we are delivered, ought to be adopted as the rule of life. All its ways are plea&s;antne&s;s. The path of obedience is peace. Permit me, therefore, to conclude in the language of an eminent, and a faithful &s;ervant of the Lamb. Finally, Men, Brethren and Fathers, with all the chri&s;tian charities mo&s;t affectionately belo|ved, what&s;over things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good report, or, if there be any other

virtue, or, ought el&s;e de&s;erving prai&s;e, as learn|ed and received from the Lord Je&s;us, or as prac|ti&s;ed by the Apo&s;tles and Primitive Churches, think ye continually on the&s;e things; and let your con&s;equent good works, the evidence of faith in Chri&s;t, as the adorning of the doctrine of the Saviour God, furni&s;h an an&s;wer unto every man, of the rea&s;on of the hope that is within you. It is yet a very little while, and the Watchmen of Mount Ephraim &s;hall cry, ari&s;e ye from earth and a&s;cend to heaven. At this all important, heart affecting, &s;oul inter|e&s;ting moment, may the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the love of God, and the fel|low&s;hip of the Spirit, enable us to an&s;wer, we come unto Thee; for thou art the Lord our God, the God of Salvation, our guide unto death and beyond it, forever and for ever, Amen and Amen.</P>
