<HEAD>WARNER MIFFLIN'S DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born and chiefly rai&s;ed on the Ea&s;tern Shore of Virginia; and although my Parents were of the religious Society called Quakers, and exemplary in their Lives, yet I witne&s;&s;ed great incitements to a departure from the prin|ciples held by that People, there being none of the Profe&s;&s;ion, except our Family within &s;ixty Miles; and my A&s;&s;ociates were of tho&s;e, who tenaciou&s;ly held the prevailing &s;entiments in fa|vour of Slavery: So that I had no opportunity of having my heart and views enlarged on this intere&s;ting Subject, by conver&s;ing with &s;uch of my Brethren in Profe&s;&s;ion, who had come to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of an impartial enquiry into the nature and tendency of this atrocious practice.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated and my Father then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a number of Slaves, I was in great danger of becoming blinded by the influence of Cu&s;tom,

the bias of Education, and the delu&s;ions of &s;elf-intere&s;t; from whence I certainly mu&s;t have become fettered as in the Chains of wrong ha|bits, had not the emanations of divine Light and Grace (which I had been early in&s;tructed to pay attention to) powerfully prevailed in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive vi&s;itations, &s;o operating as to &s;ubvert the effects of dangerous prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and di&s;po&s;ing my mind to yield to the influences of be&s;t wi&s;|dom, on this, to my pre&s;ent view, one of the wor&s;t of &s;ins.</P>
<P>And it is with peculiar &s;atisfaction I have to remark, that my Father was not long behind me in e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of Liberty: After &s;ealing the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions by the liberation of about an hundred Blacks, not|with&s;tanding the di&s;couragement of a Law then exi&s;ting, he became a zealous Advocate and interce&s;&s;or for them with their Ma&s;ters, and in many in&s;tances were his labours &s;ucce&s;sful: Of|ten appearing alone in Courts of Law, amid&s;t &s;urrounding Opponents, to plead the Cau&s;e of Individuals of the African Race, who had a claim to freedom.</P>
<P>An occurrence took place about the fourteenth year of my Age, that tended to pave the way for the reception of tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions which have &s;ince been &s;ealed with indelible clearne&s;s on my under&s;tanding. Being in the Field with my Father's Slaves, a young Man among them que&s;tioned me <Q><HI>Whether I thought it could be right, that they &s;hould be toiling to rai&s;e me, and I &s;ent to &s;chool, and by and by their children mu&s;t do &s;o for mine al&s;o?</HI></Q> Some little irrita|tion took place in my mind at fir&s;t; but his rea|&s;oning finally &s;o impre&s;&s;ed me as never to be

era&s;ed&mdash;The idea of lo&s;ing &s;o much property as what I might probably expect from the great number my Father po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;eemed hard on fir&s;t view to reconcile: however, before I ar|rived at Manhood I determined never to be a Slave holder&mdash;Yet on &s;ettling in a Married life commenced the proving of my Faith on this head&mdash;I became po&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;everal Minor Slaves by my Wife and divers came from my Fathers on different errands, with a conclu&s;ion to abide with me, without any move thereto on his part or mine: As al&s;o &s;everal that never lived with him, that were of my Mothers family of Blacks from Kent County Maryland&mdash;Thus all I then had of lawful Age, being Volunteers, I &s;at down quiet in the u&s;e of them, until at length I became almo&s;t per&s;uaded I could not do without them&mdash;And when the &s;ubject of freeing Blacks was treated on, the prevailing &s;entiment was, that Negroes were &s;uch Thieves they would not do to be free; and though this was chiefly the plea of Slave holders, yet I was glad to embrace it as a pretext for keeping mine, but I was not &s;uffered long to re&s;t unreproved in this &s;pot; my &s;ig leaf covering of excu&s;e was &s;tripped off and my &s;tate di&s;covered to me by the penetrating Rays of that Light which mak|eth manife&s;t <Q><HI>for what&s;oever maketh manife&s;t is light;</HI></Q> from whence con&s;iderable conflict aro&s;e in my &s;oul; when after continuing for &s;ome time debating, re&s;olving and re-re&s;olving, a period arrived, when he who hath his way in the Clouds, in the Whirlwind, the Earthquake, and thick darkne&s;s, was plea&s;ed to arou&s;e me to greater vigilance by his terrors for Sin, for having omitted what had appeared clearly as my

duty in this bu&s;ine&s;s, when in a time of thunder &s;torm, every fla&s;h appeared as though it might be the in&s;trument to di&s;patch me into a &s;tate of fixedne&s;s, and with the mea&s;ure of my duty herein not filled up; what then could I expect if taken in that condition, but an eternal &s;epa|ration from heavenly enjoyment? And though the&s;e &s;en&s;ations may appear &s;trange to &s;ome, who <HI>neither fear God nor regard Man</HI> yet I &s;till retain a willingne&s;s, that &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons of convul|&s;ion in the outward Elements, may be impre&s;|&s;ive of &s;olid in&s;truction to my mind.</P>
<P>It then &s;ettled on my under&s;tanding, that I &s;hould indeed be excluded from happine&s;s if I continued in this breach of the divine Law, written upon my heart as by the finger of Hea|ven; altho' want and di&s;grace to my family had pre&s;ented with threatening a&s;pect, &s;hould I ad|here to its dictates. After which, in the Year 1774, I manumited tho&s;e I had by my Wife, flattering my&s;elf &s;uch who came of their own accord I might retain while they cho&s;e to conti|nue as heretofore, &s;till being vi&s;ited with afflic|tion, on the pre&s;entation of an awful Eternity, a willingne&s;s was wrought in me to ca&s;t my care on a merciful Providence, and to re&s;ign up at all events to what I did believe was called for at my hands, that of bearing a faithful Te&s;timony again&s;t the abominable practice of en&s;laving fel|low Men, I therefore let my Father know, he mu&s;t take the Blacks away or authorize me to &s;et them free, He readily told me I might do as I would, on which in 1775 I executed another deed of Emancipation for all I held as mine.&mdash;</P>
<P>About the 24th year of my Age I was put in|to the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace, which tended
<PB N="7" REF="030793_0006_0FE92B4B1E85F318">
to excite con&s;iderable thir&s;t for preferment in Government, a ta&s;te that had much impeded the progre&s;s of my Te&s;timony again&s;t Slavery, as it furni&s;hed an Idea of additional nece&s;&s;ity for Slaves to &s;upport me in that mode of Life. Yet after tho&s;e rea&s;ons of conflict before hinted at, I be|came impre&s;&s;ed with a belief that it was right for me to decline this Office, and with it any fu|ture advancement to &s;tations in Power.&mdash;Altho' I revere Magi&s;tracy, confiding in the Sacred Text, that it is an <HI>Ordinance of God,</HI> and believing it a great benefit to mankind when executed under, his holy and pre&s;erving fear&mdash;But in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Governments, I apprehend my Brethren cannot be active therein con&s;i&s;tent with our high profe&s;&s;ion, of being called to become, thro' a faithful adherence to divine monitions, even as &s;ome of the fir&s;t fruits of the Nations unto God, in the &s;upport of our principle again&s;t War, with which the various Governments, among Men have &s;o much affinity&mdash;I was &s;olemnly impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of the tru&s;t when about undertaking the Commi&s;&s;ion, and re&s;olved to di&s;charge my duty therein fully; yet tho' I en|deavoured to perform this to the be&s;t of my un|der&s;tanding, I never felt that peace of Soul I de&s;ired, during my continuance in Office, this brought me into a &s;trict &s;crutiny, and a confirma|tion &s;ucceeded of the Truth of our great Ma|&s;ters declaration <Q><HI>My Kingdom is not of this World.</HI></Q> My mind hath remained, &s;tedfa&s;tly attached to the&s;e &s;entiments, when at different times &s;ince I have been &s;olicited to accept of any &s;tation either in the Legi&s;lative or Executive de|partments of Government, e&s;pecially as it con|&s;iderably unfits for the promulgation of peace
<PB N="8" REF="030793_0007_0FE92B52EE7BE318">
and good will among Men, when there is an embarkation in human policy, on its floating Sea of party Spirit; that gendereth envy, ma|lice, revenge, rents, divi&s;ions and War&mdash;And the abundant u&s;e of Oaths, with frequent per|juries, in what relates to matters of Govern|ment, appears to me not only a manife&s;t violati|on of Chri&s;ts injunction to his followers <Q><HI>Swear not at all,</HI></Q> as what exceedeth the &s;imple and plain communication of <Q><HI>Yea yea, and nay, nay, cometh of evil</HI></Q> but is al&s;o a profanation of the Sacred Name.</P>
<P>And indeed I have felt &s;crupulous of taking an active part at Elections, lea&s;t I &s;hould not only be|come tinctured with a Spirit of party, but al&s;o contribute by my Vote to the placing tho&s;e in power who might become oppre&s;&s;ors of tender Con&s;ciences. If we give no ju&s;t occa&s;ion of of|fence, but are in other re&s;pects u&s;eful Members of the Community, we may be admitted with|out cen&s;ure to the exerci&s;e of the&s;e &s;cruples: and it would be more to the honour as well as ble&s;|&s;ing of the World, if the tender Con&s;cience was more cheri&s;hed.</P>
<P>To re&s;ume the thread of my Narrative&mdash;I was concerned with two E&s;tates, to which be|longed many of the African Race: in one they were willed to the Heirs particularly nam|ed, and as Executor I conceived I mu&s;t ex|erci&s;e the government over them, to enable me to &s;ettle with the Heirs. But I was turned &s;olid|ly to con&s;ider, that I &s;hould not be ju&s;tified in doing that for another, which I was fully con|vinced was a &s;in to do on my own Account&mdash;The pro&s;pect being clear, a &s;olemn impre&s;&s;ion took place at the time, that I believed to be the lan|guage
<PB N="9" REF="030793_0008_0FE92B547B806818">
of holy certainty, <HI>That neither I nor mine &s;hould ever &s;uffer by my di&s;charging them</HI>; which I believe was never doubted by me. I called them in and let them know, &s;o far as I had power they were free; &s;ome who were hired by their own con&s;ent, I informed they mu&s;t con|tinue the time out and they &s;hould have their Wages, and likewi&s;e all their earnings from their Ma&s;ters death; which was fully complied with on my part to the be&s;t of my knowledge, and according to my faith &s;o was the event, the &s;eve|ral Heirs as they arrived at age, liberated the Slaves and relea&s;ed me.</P>
<P>I al&s;o found an engagement to make re&s;tituti|on to tho&s;e I had held in a State of bondage, for the time &s;o held, which was done according to the judgment of indifferent Men agreed on by my&s;elf and the blacks. And on reflection I found I had &s;o much hand in &s;elling &s;ome, as to put me under an obligation to relea&s;e them; which I did to a con&s;iderable amount, on my own account, my then Wife's, and &s;ome who belonged to her Father and Grandfather.&mdash;</P>
<P>About this time I was appointed on a Com|mittee to labour with the members of our Socie|ty who held Slaves, in order for the convince|ment of their under&s;tandings, of the incon&s;i&s;ten|cy of this practice with Chri&s;tianity; which la|bour was &s;o far ble&s;t that in a little time mo&s;t of our Members liberated theirs.&mdash;Now great &s;tir was made as if the Country was going to be over|turned and ruined. It appeared as if the Ly|ing Spirit had gone forth to deceive the Peo|ple&mdash;On my &s;etting mine free, I thought it be&s;t to put them from me, to manife&s;t they were &s;o, it was circulated that Mifflin had &s;et free a
<PB N="10" REF="030793_0009_0FE92B5C519A8BC8">
parcel of lazy worthle&s;s Negroes; he could make nothing by them, therefore &s;et them at liberty. This reflection had &s;ome weight with me, how|ever unju&s;t, and regarding Scripture injunction, not to let <HI>our good be evil &s;poken of,</HI> I thought if expedient to propo&s;e their having Land and Teams, and in return they &s;hould give me half their produce, which was put in execution with tho&s;e who cho&s;e to accept the Terms. Immedi|ately the tune was turned, that Mifflin was mak|ing more Money by his Negroes now than ever, and keeping them in more abject Slavery, under the pretence of their being free. I then deter|mined to do what I did believe to be right, not regarding the unbridled Tongues of Men, and &s;o I have endeavoured to act 'till this time, pre&s;|&s;ing through both good and evil report.</P>
<P>Another trial occurred, I felt religiou&s;ly en|gaged in Te&s;timony again&s;t the pernicious u&s;e of ardent Spirits, &s;o generally prevalent, particu|larly in time of Harve&s;t&mdash;We had been in the &s;uperfluous u&s;e of it in my family, and laying my&s;elf out as a candidate for promotion in Go|vernment as before hinted, when in the Commi&s;|&s;ion of the Peace, I frequently kept the Bottle and Bowl on the Table from Morning 'till Night; it being then, and I fear is yet too much, the corrupt manner by which worldly promotion is commonly attained: I now found a &s;ore conflict was to be experienced, in attempting a practice &s;o rever&s;e to what I had been in, and in which I should &s;tand alone. And having di&s;charged my Slaves, I feared I might never be able to &s;ave my Grain or carry on my farm to &s;upport my fa|mily, but the conviction of its rectitude was &s;uch, that I felt impelled to make the attempt, I had

a number of People in my field, a Ma&s;ter Ma&s;on with divers of his hands, among others, I thought if he became reconciled it would tend to &s;ettle the minds of his Companions, therefore began to di&s;cour&s;e with him while he was reaping; when in a mo&s;t &s;hocking manner he damned religion and &s;aid he would have Rum; this to affected me, I left the field, apprehending I &s;hould never be able to &s;tem &s;uch a torrent;, but &s;eriou&s;ly pon|dering on it, and the &s;ubject enlarging in my view with increa&s;ing weight, it &s;ealed on my Spirit, that if I &s;hould hand out this Liquor, and any Life by its means be lo&s;t, as I had &s;eve|ral times &s;een a danger of being the ca&s;e, I &s;hould not be clear of the blood of &s;uch, on which I determined thro' divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance never to u&s;e it again on any like occa&s;ions, and with thankfulne&s;s I may acknowledge I have been fa|voured never to &s;uffer damage thro' the di&s;u&s;e of it in my fields, and &s;o pre&s;erved from the mi&s;ap|plication of it &s;ince, that in all my concerns there has not been one pint u&s;ed, except on particular Occa&s;ions as Medicine, and that but little.
The late Revolution now began to make its ap|pearance and as I was religiou&s;ly re&s;trained from taking any part therein, I had the epithet of To|ryi&s;m placed on me by intere&s;ted holders of Slaves, in&s;inuations were thrown out that my labouring for the freedom of the blacks, was in order to attach them to the Briti&s;h intere&s;t, not|with&s;tanding I had liberated mine on the ground of religious conviction, before this revolution|ary period arrived&mdash;Added to this, on the i&s;&s;ue of the Bills of Credit by Congre&s;s, I felt re|&s;tricted from receiving them, left I might there|by, in &s;ome &s;ort defile my hands with one of

the Engines of War; from whence I was fur|ther dipped into &s;ympathy with the condition of the blacks, in acting &s;o as to be declared an Enemy to my Country, and like them, thrown out from the benefit of its Laws, and this for no other Crime, but yielding to the impul&s;es of divine Grace or Law of God written in my heart, which I ever found the &s;afe&s;t ground to move upon&mdash;Abundant threats were poured out, that my hou&s;e &s;hould be pulled down over my head, that I &s;hould be Shot, Carted &amp;c; this proved a fiery tryal, my &s;oul was almo&s;t overwhelmed left I &s;hould bring my family to want, and it might be through a deception. I left my hou&s;e in the night &s;ea&s;on and walked into a field in the bitter|ne&s;s of my &s;oul, and without any &s;en&s;ible relief returned back, on &s;tepping into the door I e&s;pied a Te&s;tament, and opening it in the I3th Chap. of Revelations, found mention there made of a time, when none &s;hould buy or &s;ell, but tho&s;e who received the mark of the Bea&s;t in the right Hand or forehead: and it fixed in my mind, that if I took that Money after tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, I &s;hould receive a mark of the be&s;tial &s;pirit of War in my right hand; and then the penalty which is annexed in the en&s;uing Chapter mu&s;t follow&mdash;I then re&s;olved through the Lords a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, which I craved might be afforded, let what would follow, never to deal in any of it, this afforded me &s;ome relief, and finding my Wife &s;o far united with me as to refu&s;e it like|wi&s;e (&s;aying though &s;he did not feel the matter as I did, yet through fear of weakening my hands, &s;he was mo&s;t ea&s;y not to touch it) I became much &s;trengthened and re&s;igned to &s;uffer what might be allotted, feeling at times the prevalence

Humphreys, in Philadelphia which I would recommend to the peru&s;al of my Readers, in which he remarks, <Q>Such is the dread of &s;in|gularity in di&s;&s;enting from opinions &s;anctioned by public approbation and applau&s;e, that but few have courage to for&s;ake the beaten track and think for them&s;elves, in matters confe&s;&s;edly of the highe&s;t importance: And thus the &s;pecious rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions of men, who have no better claim to infallibility than our&s;elves, are &s;uffered to divert us from a &s;imple attention to the example and unambiguous precepts of him, who has pre&s;ented to us, in his own &s;acred per&s;on, cele&s;tial excellence, and the mo&s;t com|plete pattern of all moral virtue&mdash;On &s;ub|jects which do not relate to the great truths of Religion, we may be indifferent, and it is doubtle&s;s, be&s;t not to be earne&s;t and tenacious for either &s;ide of the Que&s;tion; but when doc|trines, upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment and promulga|tion of which, the temporal and perhaps the eternal welfare of Millions in &s;ome mea&s;ure depends, it is the duty and intere&s;t of every one to &s;earch for Truth as for hid trea&s;ure; to be fully per&s;uaded in his own Mind, that his principles are founded in immutable truth and unerring rectitude&mdash;Let &s;uch then unfold the &s;acred volume, which contains the charter

of our eternal &s;alvation, and &s;ay in what part of it they can find any pa&s;&s;age that will either directly or indirectly, prove war to be ju&s;tifi|able on Chri&s;tian principles&mdash;that will furni&s;h one argument in favour of a Chri&s;tians endea|vouring to injure his fellow Creature, even his mo&s;t bitter and inveterate enemy, &s;o much as in thought; or what is more; that can ju&s;tify him in di&s;lodging a human Soul from its ap|pointed tabernacle, by de&s;troying that life which he neither gave nor can re&s;tore? Do not the doctrines of the new Te&s;tament uni|formly declare again&s;t it, and mo&s;t expre&s;sly and unequivocally prove that War is directly oppo&s;ed to the very aim and end of Chri&s;tiani|ty, which offers reconciliation to the greate&s;t of|fenders, and makes our acceptance with God ab&s;olutely to depend on our forgivene&s;s of tho&s;e by whom we our&s;elves have been in|jured?</Q>&mdash;</P>
