<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPON your &s;o earne&s;tly repeating your De&s;ire to me, to give you my Thoughts, or the Thoughts of the Gentlemen of this Town, relating to the Bank of Credit Projected; and to a Letter directed to the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives a|gain&s;t it, and the Objections made again&s;t it with no common Applau&s;e, cryed up by the Court Intere&s;t as Unan&s;werable; tho' I rea|dily acknowledge my &s;elf as unfit a Per&s;on, as you could have Writ to about it, being not concerned with the Gentlemen in the Projec|tion, and but little conver&s;ant with them, and in that I pretend to little or no acquaintance in State Affairs, or in Trade; yet when I &s;at my &s;elf down to Read that Letters, it appeared to me &s;o trifling, and below the Character of the Gentleman that Sub&s;cribed it; that it con|firmed me in my thoughts that the Cau&s;e was not &s;o good, as &s;ome Others he has plead|ed, and invited me in a few Remarks to com|ply with your Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>I frankly acknowledge, that I have been &s;ometime of the Opinion, that a Bank of Cre|dit,
<PB N="2" REF="001663_0003_0fb4d85c06159a18">
well Founded and well Regulated, would be of the greate&s;t Advantage imaginable to this Country; and therefore it was a real plea&s;ure to me, when I fir&s;t under&s;tood that a Number of Valuable Gentlemen were Con|certing proper mea&s;ures to accompli&s;h &s;o de&s;i|rable an end. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s my &s;elf to have been at a Lo&s;s when they had given the fini&s;hing &s;troke to their fir&s;t Scheme, wherein I apprehend they had left the foundation too fluctuating and changeable for a Land Bank, and that, tho' the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Bills Emit|ted, had good Security, yet it &s;eemed to me that they had not &s;ecured it well again&s;t one another, but had left it too precarious and de|pendent on the Caprice of every Accident, and the Probity and Ju&s;tice of they knew not who, which might come after them, yet I am very ready to excu&s;e them that they did not arrive to the be&s;t method in their fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay; but &s;ince this great Mi&s;take is Corrected in their la&s;t Model, <HI>viz.</HI> by every ones Mortga|ging a Real E&s;tate in proportion to the Inte|re&s;t he is to have in the Bank, and &s;o to abide during its Continuance; hereby there is &s;uita|ble provi&s;ion made not only for the Credit of their Bills and Notes, but a &s;ufficient Obliga|tion upon them to do Ju&s;tice to each other, &amp; to every man that &s;hall be concerned with them, in ca&s;e the Bank or Partner&s;hip &s;hall come to an end; which the Author of the
<PB N="3" REF="001663_0004_0fb4d85d8647f8a0">
Letter him&s;elf allows to be good; which in my Opinion before was not: All that I have to do is to blow off the Cloud of Du&s;t and Smoke, which the Author of the Letter has covered the Bank with; that when it comes to &s;tand in its native light, we may be the better able to pa&s;s a Judgment upon it; and that I may have the advantage of &s;tanding on my own grou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, (and be freed from the incumbrance of making good any of his) it will not be improper to tell you, how far I can agree with the Author of that Letter, <HI>viz. That the People as to their Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, cannot well carry on their nece&s;&s;ary Affairs much longer, without a further Supply of Money, or Bills of Credit,</HI> page 30. <HI>But there is a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upplying the People with a further convenient quantity of Bills of Credit,</HI> page 26. The Que&s;tion then is, Whe|ther the Publick &s;hall Emit the&s;e Bills of Credit; or whether it had not better be done by a Company of men in the nature of a Private Bank of Credit. I agree with the Author al&s;o in this, <HI>That I am not a-again&s;t a Bank of Credit in general, were it well founded, well regulated,</HI> page 26. I leave out the words (by the Government,) becau&s;e the Con&s;ideration, whether by the Govern|ment, or otherwi&s;e comes under the forego|ing Quaery; &s;o that the Que&s;tion here is, <HI>Whether or no this Projection for a Bank of
<PB N="4" REF="001663_0005_0fb4d8625814f678">
Credit be well Founded, well Limited, and Regu|lated?</HI> And here I cannot avoid doing the Gentlemen that Ju&s;tice to &s;ay what &s;ome of their Number have informed me, namely that when they fir&s;t waited on his Excellency with their fir&s;t Scheme, they were de&s;ired to leave the Limitation to the General Court, that it was a proper Compliment to pay them, to de|&s;ire them to &s;et the Sum, which was one rea|&s;on why there was no Limitation; but this by the way.</P>
<P>We agree thirdly, <HI>That the Projection of a Bank of Credit, very much imports the Prerogative of the Crown, the Con&s;titution and Laws of the Province, the E&s;tates and Liberties of the People; and that not only for the pre&s;ent, but Succeeding Generations,</HI> page 4. For I take it, that the word import when &s;o u&s;ed, generally means to be of advantage; however to deal fairly, it &s;hall be the que&s;tion, <HI>Whether it imports to their advantage or di&s;advantage, and which does most of all import them, the Publick or the Pri|vate Bank</HI>? I agree with him al&s;o, <HI>That it be|hooves the Government and General A&s;&s;embly of the Province, and really concerns every man, that has any Interest in the Country, with great appli|cation to enquire into, and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the Nature and Con&s;equences of this Bank or Part|ner&s;hip,</HI> page 4. And &s;o Sir, I am &s;ufficiently warranted to make my Enquiry, and endea|vour to &s;et things in a true light; but to find
<PB N="5" REF="001663_0006_0fb4d864cf4af678">
the&s;e things wherein we agree to confu&s;edly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umbled together as they are in Mr. <HI>Attorneys</HI> Letter, that they might appear a &s;ort of dark Arguments again&s;t a Bank of Credit, is &s;uch a fine Amu&s;ement to the Ignorant and Injudici|ous Reader, and &s;uch an odd way of rea&s;on|ing, that we could have expected it from none, but he that had lo&s;t his own eyes, or thought every body el&s;e was blind. And to be plain, when I heard of &s;uch a Letter publi&s;hed in Mr. <HI>Attorneys</HI> Name, I expected to find the &s;tronge&s;t Arguments, and the faire&s;t Pleadings that could be, again&s;t the Private Bank of Credit, from a Gentleman of &s;o bright Parts, and &s;o Learned in the Law, as is his general Character: Yet I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you, that I had not read over the fir&s;t page, before I had alte|red my mind, and received this &s;ettled Idea of the whole Piece; that I &s;hould find nothing in it but Eva&s;ions, Doublings and Mi&s;repre|&s;entations, and &s;ome few amu&s;ements; for I was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;o fair (not to &s;ay fal&s;e) a light given to the Order of the Governour and Council, which being Publick, every one has the opportunity to &s;ee and judge of the fallacy. He tells us, page 3. <HI>That the Project|ors were directed to proceed no further in the Af|fair, till the next Se&s;&s;ions of the General A&s;&s;embly; notwith&s;tanding all which (I am loth to &s;ay in contempt of it) the per&s;ons concerned are openly carrying on their Bank with utmost Vigour and
<PB N="6" REF="001663_0007_0fb4d865c6d24ac8">
Expedition.</HI> How could he Sir, &s;o openly give us this wrong Account of the matter? My News-Letter Printed by Authority, <HI>August</HI> 23. tells me, that upon Reading, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Order|ed, <HI>That the Projectors or &V;ndertakers of any &s;uch Bank, do not proceed to Print the Scheme, or put the &s;ame on Publick Record, Make or Emit any of their Notes or Bills, until they have laid their Propo&s;als before the General A&s;&s;embly of this Her Majesties Province, who are always ready to Encourage and Countenance any Propo&s;als,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I. A.</HI> Secr. Which Order, as it was far from for|bidding their proceeding any further in that Affair; as to the dige&s;ting their thoughts up|on it, and filling up their Number, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but rather &s;uppos'd they ought to wade through all the difficulties, and bring their Scheme to its perfection, that it might be fit to lay be|fore the General A&s;&s;embly; &s;o was it, as I have been well informed, in every Article complied with, in Duty to the Government; and even to this day have neither Printed their Scheme, Put it on Publick Record, Made, nor Emitted any of their Notes or Bills; &s;o that really Sir, what has been done by the Projectors, won't bear &s;o much, as a, <HI>notwithstanding,</HI> much le&s;s, <HI>a, loth to &s;ay in con|tempt.</HI> Indeed, I have heard it whi&s;pered, that they have thought the Order very hard, in that they were denied the benefit of the Pre&s;s, and the benefit of Public Records,
<PB N="7" REF="001663_0008_0fb4d86745cb8158">
which I &s;hall leave: And now Sir, after &s;o plain, and publickly known, a fal&s;e Comment, upon the Order of the Governour and Coun|cil, and the Actions of the Projectors in the very Entrance of the Letter; what can be lookt for, but Arguments of the &s;ame Kid|ney thro' the whole: And I Confe&s;s when I had Read the Letter out, I &s;hould verily have thought it had been Calculated to Lull the Government into a profound Sleep, if I had not remembred that he &s;aid page 5. <HI>his de&s;ign was to Awaken it</HI>; &s;o ea&s;ily do we mi&s;take things till we are informed better. But not to give you or my &s;elf any further trouble a|bout the de&s;ign of it, believing it is not laid &s;o deep, but your penetration without be|ing put to the Wreck will fathom it. I Re|turn to the fir&s;t Enquiry, &s;ince 'tis agreed there is a nece&s;&s;ity of a certain number of Bills of Credit, or Notes to be Emitted, as a Medium in Trade, <HI>viz. Who &s;hall Emit the&s;e Bills?</HI> Had the Government of the Country be&s;t take it on them&s;elves? or would it not be &s;afer to permit particular Per&s;ons in Partner&s;hip to I&s;|&s;ue out, and give a Currency to their own Notes, founded on their Lands, under the name of a Bank of Credit? This is the main Enquiry which now falls under every Bodies Examination, and becomes the debate of the Town this Winter Sea&s;on; and that I may give you my thoughts upon it freely, I &s;ay

with all due Deference to Government, by all means let the Governments Notes, Emitted to pay the Publick Dues, and called in by Taxes granted as a Fund for them, have all po&s;|&s;ible Honour and Credit among&s;t us; and if in their great wi&s;dom they &s;hould &s;ee meet to make it a Publick Charge, to Emit a certain number of their Notes in Erecting a Bridge o|ver <HI>Charles</HI>-River, and make it a Toll Bridge, with &s;uitable Allowances to the Colledge at pre&s;ent; and &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Forty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> were I&s;&s;ued out to make it a &s;ub&s;tantial and firm Bridge; and that a Toll upon every thing pa&s;&s;ing and carried over, &s;hould be a Fund to Call them in gradually; and after that it had cleared it &s;elf, it &s;hould be taken off from Pa&s;&s;engers, and left only for Carts, Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Colledge have the Income for e|ver, or any &s;uch Publick Charge, as Fortifying the principal Town by Sea, Erecting Stone Forti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ications or Garri&s;ons on the Frontiers, or Erecting Light Hou&s;es, for the Security of Trade; and the Re-&s;ettling the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Parts of the Country in a Defen&s;ible manner, in gi|ving a Bounty for the encouraging the Sowing, water-rotting, and well curing of Hemp; the encouraging them that &s;hould make the be&s;t pieces of Hollands-Duck: Which two Arti|cles alone, it is thought might &s;o effect the ballance of our Trade, as to bring us in Silver Money; e&s;pecially if a Reward of <HI>Three Pounds

The Debts Con|tracted by the&s;e Emi&s;&s;ions would be the real Credit of the Country, both Serviceable and Honourable, the Strength, Support, &amp; Exter|ternal Glory of a Country; and whereas the Trade wants a Medium to Circulate it, there would be no nece&s;&s;ity of Laying heavy Taxes, &amp; the Funds might be carried forwards as the Government would &s;ee cau&s;e; for I believe by this time mo&s;t men of thought may &s;ee, that &s;ince Paper Notes are our only Medium, that Day we are out of Debt, we are out of Cre|dit, and mu&s;t unavoidably &s;ink, unle&s;s there &s;hould be found out &s;ome other way to &s;ave us from Ruin. So the Que&s;tion comes the fairer in view, <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther is the better of the Two, a Publick or a Private Bank</HI>?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001663_0011_0fb4d86ec68f7180">I &s;hall therefore in the next Place, give you tho&s;e Rea&s;ons that are of weight with me a|gain&s;t a Publick Bank, and Re&s;cue the Private from the Authors Objections: For the&s;e Rea|&s;ons may not the Publick Bank be Objected a|gain&s;t? May there not be a danger if the Pub|lick &s;hould go on to Emit Bills on Intere&s;t, that it will be too great an Inva&s;ion of the Preroga|tive of the Crown: For I am apt to think e|very body will grant, that the Stamping of Money is a Royalty inve&s;ted in the Crown; and I am prone to imagine, that Bills Emitted by Publick Authority to Lend at Intere&s;t, will carry with them many &s;ignatures of Money; e&s;pecially &s;ince the Act of this Province makes them a Legal Tender, &s;o far as no man may be Impri&s;on'd for Debt that Tenders them; e&s;|pecially if we Con&s;ider the difference in the Emi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Bank Bills, that they are not paid out of the Trea&s;ury, as the Notes Obliga|tory of the Government to tho&s;e they were Indebted unto, with the Publick Faith, plight|ed to Call them in by Taxes; and &s;o tho' they are of the &s;ame Tenour, yet the manner of the Emi&s;&s;ion, with that Law cited, gives them the character of real Money; for I cannot per|&s;wade my &s;elf to &s;ay with Mr. <HI>Attorney,</HI> that nothing can be Money properly, but Silver and Gold, becau&s;e that both Copper &amp; Bra&s;s have had the Royal Stamp, and Copper pa&s;&s;es in &s;mall Payments, as other Money in
<PB N="11" REF="001663_0012_0fb4d87045d7ae88">
<HI>Great Britain</HI> at this day; and I have al&s;o heard, that Leather was once the current Coin of <HI>Rome:</HI> And I am very much inclined to think, if the Crown of <HI>England</HI> &s;aw cau&s;e, they could make Paper Bills, &s;o &s;tamped, as proper|ly Money, as any Money what&s;oever. Now is there not ground to fear, when the Sove|reign has been plea&s;ed to indulge us with the Priviledges of Emitting Publick Notes for the defraying the nece&s;&s;ary Charge in the Defence and Support of the Government, and to Con|fine us to tho&s;e Occa&s;ions in the Taxes and A&s;|&s;e&s;sments allowed to be made on the Inhabi|tants; would it not be looked on as an In|croachment in very deed on the Royal Prero|gative for us to exceed, and what the Con&s;e|quence of that will be, you are a much better Judge than I am; (and I have been informed that the Gentlemen concerned, have had Let|ters from their Friends at Home, advi&s;ing that by no means the Government would be Con|cerned in &s;uch a Fund) but if it &s;hould not in all the &s;ignatures of Money be a direct In|va&s;ion of the Prerogative, on the account of its being really Money, yet would it not be a going beyond our La&s;t? and a doing what we had no power or warrant for; for I look upon it a weak &amp; fooli&s;h plea, &s;ome peoples mouths are filled with, <HI>viz.</HI> That we ought not to de|bate about the Power of the Government, that it tends to weaken us, and that there are
<PB N="12" REF="001663_0013_0fb4d8728578e4e8">
enough that do that, and the like. I think the way to have our Powers rendred &s;trong &amp; durable, would be to Con&s;ider what they are, and u&s;e them, and not go to the brink, or one hairs breadth beyond them: And truly I fear there is &s;ome de&s;ign in rai&s;ing all this &s;mother, to blindfold is, and lead us whence we cannot &s;o ea&s;ily return. I take it that our Charter &s;ets us the bounds of our Power, and tells us how far we may go, and all without that is forbidden ground; now it is a plain thing, that the Governments Emitting Bills of Pub|lick Credit on Intere&s;t, is not to be found, nei|ther granted or warranted by the Charter, the boundaries thereof are <HI>A&s;&s;e&s;sments and Taxes, in the nece&s;&s;ary defence and &s;upport of the Govern|ment, and the protection and pre&s;ervation of the In|habitants there.</HI>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Attorney</HI> has given it us, <HI>page</HI> 29. He was &s;o well apprized of this Ob|jection, that he lays out his &s;trength to remove it; tho' I think he has not been able to make it &s;tir one inch. He tells us, <HI>there is nothing in the Charter repugnant to the Governments I&s;|&s;uing a further &s;upply of Bills,</HI> page 29. It is very true upon the Foot or Fund of A&s;&s;e&s;s|ments, as they have been hitherto Emitted, for Paying the Debts, and Defraying the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Charges of the Province; but once for all, the Charter may well be allow'd to be repugnant to all that is not fairly Con|tained in it. He &s;ays &s;econdly, <HI>That it has
<PB N="13" REF="001663_0014_0fb4d87405c15bb0">
been done once and again, on great Occa&s;ions, and the Government not blamed for it.</HI> The Government has Emitted their Bills to pay their Debts, but never to Lend at Intere&s;t, before his Letter was written, which is the matter in Controver&s;y. The Bills the Mer|chants Tent to the Trea&s;ury, and the Trea|&s;ury in Return, Lent the Merchants by Or|der of Government on that great Emergen|cy, were for the paying Her Maje&s;ties Sol|diers, and would not have been Emitted, but in &s;uch an Extraordinary Ca&s;e, and up|on that bottom, &s;o that it can never be made the pre&s;ident to Lett out Bills at In|tere&s;t: and then he would per&s;wade us (not him&s;elf) that the words the nece&s;&s;ary Sup|port of the Government, protection and pre|&s;ervation of the People, will allow it, and &s;o for&s;ooth with an (if) it is <HI>&amp; cra,</HI> then it comes within the Charter; and I am verily per&s;waded (if) he were of Councel again&s;t us, he would with all imaginable Ju&s;tice declare, as every rea&s;onable man el&s;e (e&s;pecially a Gentleman of the Law) would, that the evident meaning of the&s;e words are, the Charges of the Government and the War, even all &s;uch Charge as the Inhabi|tants &s;hall be A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and Taxed for, and that they have not the lea&s;t a&s;pect upon a Fund for Trade, or the &s;upplying the Peo|ple with a Medium of Exchange, &amp; there|fore

<P>I cannot help reciting the words of the Charter here: <HI>We do,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Give, Grant,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>To Make, Ordain, and Establi&s;h all manner of Whole&s;ome and Rea&s;onable Orders, Laws, &s;ta|tutes, and Ordinances, Directions and In&s;tructi|ons, either with Penalties or without, &s;o as the &s;ame be not repugnant or contrary to the Laws of

<P N="3">3. That the Credit of every Freeholder is as much his Property as his Lands.

<P>If the General Court Emit Bills Obligatory upon the Province, whether they are not bound in Ju&s;tice and Honour to make them good as much as private men; and whether it is not creating a Debt upon the Province for &s;uch Sums as &s;hall be &s;o Emitted, which they mu&s;t make good to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, which is a burden, and may be called a Tax with a Witne&s;s.

<P N="1">1. That there will be no Inva&s;ion of the Pre|rogative; for every body as well as Mr. <HI>At|torney</HI> will readily accknowledge that, <HI>they are not Money,</HI> page 11. And they may have the face and &s;ignature of Money, as much as the Bank Bills of <HI>England,</HI> that is none at all; for they carry nothing of Authority with them, but are only Notes on the Bank, pa&s;&s;ing from one to another, for &s;o much value as is expre&s;|&s;ed in them; which value being depo&s;ited in the Bank, either in Lands or other imperi&s;hable E&s;tate as the Original Fund, and the Obligation of the &s;everal Partners, to take 'em in all Pay|ments, except Specialties, under a great penal|ty, gives Credit to the &s;everal Bills or Notes i&s;&s;ued from the Bank.</P>
