<Q>"For brethren ye have been called unto liberty; only u&s;e not liberty for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h, but by love &s;erve one another."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN Mo&s;es, being called by God from an ob&s;cure &s;tate of life, to &s;tand before a court, and deliver the me&s;&s;age of Heaven to them, would have excu&s;ed him&s;elf, alledging that "He was not eloquent," his fal&s;e mode&s;ty was frowned upon; his pleas were all over-ruled; and he was animated to his great work, with a promi&s;e of &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance from God: "I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou &s;halt &s;ay."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018526_0005_0FA7AC2253A80B20">
THIS in&s;tance may, I think, encourage us to hope for divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, whenever we are by the providence of God called to undertake &s;ervices for which we may &s;eem too unequal. It is this hope emboldens me now to appear in this place: and it is al&s;o hoped that the pre&s;ent attempt, undertaken in obedience to authority, may be favorably accepted, or at lea&s;t excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>ON this occa&s;ion, it will not, I pre&s;ume, be expected, or de&s;ired, that I &s;hould attempt to go beyond my own line, or affect to di&s;cour&s;e as a connoi&s;&s;eur in politics; but that I a&s;&s;i&s;t as a CHRISTIAN MINISTER at the &s;olemn acts of religious wor&s;hip which are this day publicly offered by a CHRISTIAN STATE to the &s;upreme King of nations, who&s;e ordinance civil govern|ment is; from whom all the authority of rulers and all the rights of &s;ubjects are originally deri|ved; to whom the mutual duties of all orders of men are to be ultimately referred; and by who&s;e ble&s;&s;ing alone, communities, as well as individuals, can be happy.</P>
<P>THE knowledge of our&s;elves is confe&s;&s;edly a capital and fundamental point of true wi&s;dom. "The proper knowledge of mankind is man." And of this there is no branch which more de|&s;erves the attention of every one, than to under|&s;tand our <HI>duty</HI> on the one hand, and our <HI>rights</HI> and <HI>privileges</HI> on the other. For want of clear and ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the&s;e things, &s;ome have been ready to imagine that there is a kind of
<PB N="7" REF="018526_0006_0FA7AC2422B27A10">
oppo&s;ition between duty and right; or in other words, that the bonds of duty are a re&s;traint and abridgment of liberty; and that liberty is a licence to do whatever we plea&s;e.&mdash;Hence dif|ferent men have inclined to different extremes. Some by urging the obligations of duty in &s;uch a manner as tends to beget and cheri&s;h a &s;pirit of bondage, and by laying heavy burdens on the con&s;ciences of men in things where God has left them free, have intrenched on the rights and liberties of mankind. Others, in their unguard|ed zeal for liberty, have relaxed the bonds of duty, and have given and taken too much en|couragement to licenciou&s;ne&s;s, "u&s;ing liberty for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h."</P>
<P>BUT our duties, and our rights or privileges, if rightly &s;tated, are &s;o far from interfering, or being incon&s;i&s;tent, that they mutually infer, e&s;ta|bli&s;h, and &s;upport each other.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle, in the words now read, appears to have had both the mentioned extremes di&s;|tinctly in his view. As there were &s;ome who, by endeavouring to impo&s;e the ob&s;ervance of the abrogated ordinances of the Jewi&s;h law, incroach|ed on the rights and liberty of chri&s;tians, St. Paul a&s;&s;erts the&s;e their rights, reminds his chri&s;tian brethren that Chri&s;t had made them free, and exhorts them to &s;tand fa&s;t in their liberty to which they were called, and not be entangled with a yoke of bondage. At the &s;ame time he cautions them again&s;t the oppo&s;ite extreme,
<PB N="8" REF="018526_0007_0FA7AC242F58A6B8">
of abu&s;ing liberty for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h; or of indulging them&s;elves in a carnal licentious life; and then directs them "by love to &s;erve one another," and not think &s;uch mutual &s;ub|jection to be any way un&s;uitable the honor they were called to, of being the Lord's free men.</P>
<P>BUT whatever may be the &s;pecial occa&s;ion of the words, and however we may expound them in reference to that occa&s;ion, we may, I think, be allowed to con&s;ider them as applicable to all tho&s;e liberties which belong to us either <HI>as men,</HI> or <HI>as citizens,</HI> or <HI>as chri&s;tians.</HI> GOD has called us to liberty in all the&s;e different re&s;pects; and the go&s;pel furni&s;hes us with a good warrant to a&s;&s;ert and claim the&s;e our rights. And though the main de&s;ign of the &s;acred writers be to in|&s;truct us in the great concernments of our eter|nal &s;alvation; yet they have al&s;o given us to un|der&s;tand, that liberty, in a more general &s;en&s;e, is our indefea&s;ible right. Chri&s;tianity is indeed alike favorable to the liberty of &s;ubjects, and the rightful authority of rulers; and is the be&s;t &s;ecurity and &s;upport of both in their proper con|&s;i&s;tency with each other. And we are more be|holden to the oracles of GOD than to the &s;chools of philo&s;ophy, for ju&s;t and generous notions of the rights of mankind.&mdash;A chri&s;tian, be&s;ides his peculiar &s;piritual privileges, holds his natural and civil liberty by a &s;tronger handle than any other, and can maintain it to better advantage. He has by the go&s;pel, a new covenant right to the com|mon privileges of humanity, as well as to tho&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="018526_0008_0FA7AC24E75123C8">
&s;pecial ones he is entitled to as a child and heir of GOD. That &s;tate of liberty to which he is called, and which he is authorized to claim and maintain, comprehends tho&s;e <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>civil</HI> rights which belong to him as <HI>a man,</HI> or as a <HI>member of the commonwealth,</HI> as well as tho&s;e <HI>&s;pecial privileges</HI> which appertain to him as <HI>a &s;ubject of the kingdom of heaven.</HI> If I &s;hould therefore take occa&s;ion to offer &s;ome con&s;idera|tions on LIBERTY in this general view, the ar|gument would, I conceive, be not foreign to my text, nor un&s;uitable to the pre&s;ent &s;olemnity, nor unworthy of the attention of this grave and re|&s;pectable audience.</P>
<P>HERE are three points which require to be di&s;tinctly con&s;idered, as the time will allow: and I &s;hall take them in the &s;ame order in which they lie before us in our text.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>FIRST. That GOD has called us to liberty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>SECONDLY. Liberty ought not to be u&s;ed for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h, or a pretence for carnal and licentious indulgencies.</ITEM>
<ITEM>THIRDLY. It is our duty, and no infringe|ment of our rights and privileges, to &s;erve one another in love.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>FIRST. GOD hath called us to liberty.&mdash;</P>
<P>IT is his declared will, that mankind &s;hould be free. The cau&s;e of liberty is the cau&s;e of GOD;
<PB N="10" REF="018526_0009_0FA7AC25A8D31C60">
which he approves, favors, and befriends. The law and light of nature make it evident that li|berty is the right of all mankind. But the &s;criptures make it yet more evident that the peo|ple of GOD, the &s;ubjects of his heavenly king|dom, are entitled to, and inve&s;ted with, this in|valuable privilege, of which they have in the go&s;pel an authentic charter, ratified, &s;ealed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">worn by GOD him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary that we here examine <HI>what we are to under&s;tand by that</HI> LIBERTY <HI>which we claim as our right,</HI> by virtue of a Di|vine grant. For though we are generally for|ward to profe&s;s our&s;elves to be its friends and advocates, and the love of it is &s;aid to be natural to us; yet there are many who do not well un|der&s;tand what they &s;ay, or whereof they affirm, in their flouri&s;hes on this &s;ubject. Indeed, if the matter be duly con&s;idered, we &s;hall have rea&s;on to think that none but per&s;ons of real virtue are heartily friendly to <HI>true liberty,</HI> or de&s;ire the en|joyment of it either for them&s;elves or others, whatever flattering encomiums they may be&s;tow upon it.</P>
<P>WHEN we &s;peak of liberty as our right or privilege, we mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean &s;ome|thing valuable, dignifying, and de&s;irable; &s;ome|thing which our nature and &s;tate are capable of; &s;omething which is con&s;i&s;tent with our moral agency, and our being under the obligations of law, and duty to our maker and our fellow crea|tures.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="018526_0010_0FA7AC26677F6B70">
HENCE it follows clearly, that human liberty cannot con&s;i&s;t in lawle&s;s licentiou&s;ne&s;s, or in be|ing independent, and not &s;ubject to any authori|ty; or in being allowed to invade the rights of others; to act unrea&s;onably, and make our&s;elves and our fellow-creatures mi&s;erable. Far be it from any of us to imagine that the &s;tate of liber|ty, to which God has called us, di&s;&s;olves the bonds of our duty, or confounds the e&s;&s;ential differen|ces of right and wrong: or to entertain &s;o ab|&s;urd a thought as that any one can po&s;&s;ibly have a right to do wrong: or to conceive that an ex|emption from the obligations of morality, and from &s;ubjection to rightful authority, would be any de&s;irable privilege.&mdash;A lawle&s;s per&s;on is the ba&s;e&s;t, mo&s;t odious and contemptible creature in the world.</P>
<P>EVERY man is nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubject to the au|thority of GOD. This is indeed an argument of our imperfection and dependent &s;tate. But we are &s;o far from having any rea&s;on to be unea&s;y at it, that it is matter of joy and glorying to us that the Lord is our king. And his authority over us is &s;o far from depriving us of any de&s;ira|ble liberty, that it is indeed the ba&s;is, guard and &s;ecurity of it. We therefore claim it as our right to be free from every yoke of bondage which can ju&s;tly be accounted any grievance, becau&s;e we are the &s;ervants of God, who allows none to tyrannize or u&s;urp authority over any, and for|bids our &s;ubmitting to &s;uch unauthori&s;ed claims. And though we are required to be &s;ubject to
<PB N="12" REF="018526_0011_0FA7AC2726D475D0">
our lawful &s;uperiors in <HI>families,</HI> in <HI>church</HI> and <HI>&s;tate,</HI> yet God requires us to yield this obedi|ence not with a &s;lavi&s;h, but a free and liberal &s;pirit&mdash;we are to be &s;ubject to the higher powers in the Lord, and for the Lord's &s;ake, who&s;e or|dinance they are. And while we obey their lawful commands, it is our right and duty to di&s;own them for our ab&s;olute ma&s;ters. For we are not the &s;ervants of men, but of God alone.</P>
<P>IF I &s;hould attempt a definition or de&s;cription of <HI>liberty</HI> in general, con&s;idered as a right or pri|vilege claimable by mankind, I would &s;ay that <HI>it con&s;i&s;ts in a per&s;on's being allowed to hold, u&s;e and enjoy all his faculties, advantages, and rights, according to his own judgment and plea&s;ure, in &s;uch ways as are con&s;i&s;tent with the rights of others, and the duty we owe to our maker and our fellow creatures.</HI> Liberty mu&s;t never be u&s;ed but within the bounds of right and duty. God allows us not to hold, u&s;e, or enjoy any thing to the injury of any one. A licence to do wrong and encroach on the rights of others, is no part of that liberty which God has granted us; nor is it any re&s;traint of our true freedom for us to be re&s;trained by laws from wicked, unrea&s;onable and injurious actions.</P>
<P>BUT that we may under&s;tand more di&s;tinctly the nature and extent of our liberty under the government of God, we may con&s;ider our&s;elves in three different &s;tates&mdash;1&s;t. As <HI>individual per|&s;ons</HI> in what is called the <HI>&s;tate of nature,</HI> that is
<PB N="13" REF="018526_0012_0FA7AC27E6D767B8">
previous to &s;uch confederation as forms a civil community.&mdash;2dly. As <HI>united</HI> and incorporated into a <HI>political &s;ociety.</HI>&mdash;3dly. As <HI>members</HI> of the <HI>church</HI> of God.&mdash;An&s;werably to the&s;e &s;everal &s;tates or capacities, we may con&s;ider that liberty which we claim as our right as coming under a threefold di&s;tinction and denomination: &s;uppo|&s;ing any one to be in a &s;tate of nature, he has then a right to NATURAL LIBERTY: if we con&s;ider him as a member of a civil body, he has a right to CIVIL LIBERTY; and if a member of the chri&s;tian church, he is entitled to CHRISTIAN LIBERTY.</P>
<P><HI>NATURAL LIBERTY</HI> does not con&s;i&s;t in an exemption from the obligations of mora|lity, and the duties of truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and kindne&s;s to our fellow men; nor does it give any one a right to &s;eize by force or fraud what|ever he may have a mind for, how much &s;oever it may be to the damage of others; as &s;ome have mo&s;t ab&s;urdly taught. The obligation of the law of God, which we are all under, and which requires us to love our neighbour, and do as we would be done unto, does not take its force from human compacts. Our natural rights are bounded and determined by the law of nature, which binds us to be &s;ubject to the will and authority of God, to love and wor&s;hip him; to be ju&s;t and benevolent to our fellow creatures, doing them all the good in our power, and offering no injury or abu&s;e to any one. It is therefore no violation of our natural liberty and
<PB N="14" REF="018526_0013_0FA7AC28A7CB4568">
rights for us not to be allowed to do wrong, and to be re&s;trained by force and puni&s;hments, from invading the right and property of others.</P>
<P>BUT in a &s;tate of natural liberty, every one has a right to be exempt from &s;ubjection to the authority of any man. There is al&s;o a right to think, &s;peak, and act freely, without compul&s;ion or re&s;traint; and to u&s;e our faculties and pro|perty as we plea&s;e, provided that none are there|by injured, nor the obligations of morality in|fringed. Liberty of con&s;cience is al&s;o the natural and unalienable right of every one: A right of which no man can be ju&s;tly deprived; which can never be forfeited, never given up to any one upon earth. Our Supreme Lord allows us not to &s;ubject our con&s;ciences to the authority of any but him&s;elf alone. If therefore any one &s;hould con&s;ent to give up this previous branch of liberty, and acknowledge any man as the Lord of his con&s;cience, &s;uch an unwarrantable act would be null and void.&mdash;In a &s;tate of natural liberty, men have al&s;o a right to form &s;uch a&s;&s;oci|ations with others, and enter into &s;uch confedera|tions, and &s;ubmit to &s;uch laws and con&s;titutions, as &s;hall be for the general good. In other words, they have <HI>a right to form into a civil &s;ociety,</HI> and authorize fit per&s;ons to exerci&s;e the powers of government nece&s;&s;ary to effectuate the good ends for which the &s;ocial union is formed.</P>
<P>BUT it is to be carefully remembered, that no man has ever any rightful liberty to con&s;ent
<PB N="15" REF="018526_0014_0FA7AC2966966330">
to any con&s;titution or compact incon&s;i&s;tent with his own &s;afety and welfare, and that of his fellow men: for in&s;tance, to authorize any to govern unrighteou&s;ly and oppre&s;&s;ively.&mdash;The e&s;tabli&s;hing a pernicious tyranny is a great injury to mankind, and &s;o is beyond the limits of our natural rights. No human laws or covenants can give any authority or validity to an act which God di&s;allows: and if any people have been &s;o imprudent and blameable as to con|&s;ent to, and put them&s;elves under a tyrannical government, they are &s;o far from being bound in honor or con&s;cience to &s;upport it, that it is their duty to overthrow and aboli&s;h it as &s;oon as they can&mdash;As individual per&s;ons in a &s;tate of natural liberty have no right or leave from God to make them&s;elves mi&s;erable, or to injure and oppre&s;s others; &s;o they have no right or leave to join and concur with others in any mea&s;ures incon&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t of mankind.&mdash;And as no &s;ociety has a right to oppre&s;s any of its members, it cannot convey to any one a right|ful authority to oppre&s;s. All tyrannical govern|ment is therefore an unauthorized inva&s;ion of the rights of mankind, and no obedience is due to it.</P>
<P>A JUST apprehen&s;ion of our <HI>natural rights</HI> is very u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary in order to our con|ceiving aright the nature and extent of CIVIL LIBERTY, which is next to come under our con&s;ideration. And we are now to view man|kind as united together in political &s;ocieties or
<PB N="16" REF="018526_0015_0FA7AC2AD2B1EB50">
&s;tates, that &s;o the united wi&s;dom and &s;trength of a community may be employed to advantage for the good of the whole, and of the &s;everal individual members, in a con&s;i&s;tency with the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THAT the human &s;pecies were formed and de&s;igned for civil union, appears from the rati|onal faculties, and &s;ocial affections which God has given them. It appears al&s;o from their mo|ral character, and &s;tate, and the need they &s;tand in of mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in order that their rights and properties may be better &s;ecured, and enjoyed to greater advantage. The &s;tate of nature, tho' attended with &s;ome peculiar privileges, is yet very un&s;afe, and &s;ubject to great and manifold difficulties and di&s;advantages. Civil polity is evidently for the intere&s;t of mankind: and in a well con&s;tituted and regulated &s;tate, &s;ubjection to civil government is no way prejudicial to true liberty. For though &s;ome of our natural rights and property are, as it were, put into a common &s;tock, under the management of the community; yet this is &s;uppo&s;ed to be done by our own free con&s;ent, and in the prudent exerci&s;e of our na|tural liberty. And as each one continually re|ceives his &s;hare of the va&s;t profits thence accruing to the community, and has his mo&s;t important rights &s;o &s;ecured and improved as to be much more valuable; he is, upon the whole, a great gainer by all the expence he is at for the public &s;ervice, and enjoys more liberty for the re&s;traints he &s;ubmits to.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="018526_0016_0FA7AC2AE894B3D0">
NAY, further: &s;ince civil polity is evidently for the good of mankind, and &s;ince no individu|al ought to hold his natural right of independence, if it &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to the general intere&s;t&mdash;it would &s;eem that men's entering into civil &s;oci|ety was a matter of duty as well as right; and that they may be ju&s;tly compelled to it, when the general intere&s;t &s;o requires.&mdash;</P>
<P>Now, in every civil body there mu&s;t be a go|verning authority and power, to be exerci&s;ed on the behalf of the community, over the &s;everal members&mdash;ordering matters of common concern|ment for the good of the whole: and the right|ful authority of tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with powers of government, is the ordinance of God. They are not only the tru&s;tees of the &s;tate, but the mini&s;ters of GOD, who ratifies their com|mi&s;&s;ion, requiring every &s;oul to be &s;ubject to them, and not re&s;i&s;t them on their peril, in the due exerci&s;e of their authority.</P>
<P>FROM the brief account here given of a &s;tate of civil polity, it is plain that civil liberty divides into two branches, which will require &s;ome di|&s;tinct notice. It includes the <HI>freedom of the &s;tate</HI> con&s;idered as a &s;y&s;tem or collective body. It includes al&s;o <HI>the freedom of the &s;everal parts</HI> or members of which the community is com|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE FORMER BRANCH of civil liberty is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a people, when they hold and are
<PB N="18" REF="018526_0017_0FA7AC2BA8531308">
allowed freely to exerci&s;e the rights, powers, and prerogatives of FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES. The&s;e are much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of an individual in the &s;tate of natural liberty and independence; of which we have given &s;ome account: and are alike limited by the law of nature and of GOD, who is the &s;overeign of nations as well as of particular per&s;ons.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING what has been &s;o bold|ly pretended by &s;ome, of the tran&s;cendent au|thority, and omnipotency of the &s;upreme civil power, and of tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of government, it is plain that the whole authority of a &s;tate over its members is limited. The liberty and authority of a free commonwealth to enact and execute laws and ordinances for the public good, mu&s;t be always under&s;tood with this limitation, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;<HI>that the &s;acred rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s are not to be violated at any rate.</HI> The liberty and &s;overeignty of a &s;tate implies no right or authority to &s;erve its own intere&s;t by unju&s;t or immoral mea&s;ures; even though &s;uch mea&s;ures &s;hould be thought for the public advantage. It has no rightful li|berty, under any &s;uch pretence, to violate the laws of GOD, or the rights of any of its mem|bers, to oppre&s;s or injure any of its neighbours, or fal&s;ify the public faith. That common max|im,
<PB N="19" REF="018526_0018_0FA7AC2C6C5CBC38">
"that the &s;afety and welfare of the people is the &s;upreme law," how much &s;oever it has been applauded, is, therefore, un&s;ound morality, unle&s;s it be under&s;tood and applied in an invaria|ble agreement with that divine rule, "that evil is not to be done that good may come." Every man has his private, unalienable rights, particu|larly the right of con&s;cience, which he ought to hold and u&s;e without re&s;traint or di&s;turbance from any human authority. There can &s;carce be a wor&s;e mi&s;take than to think that the laws of morality mu&s;t give way to &s;erve any intere&s;t, whether public or private; or that all per&s;onal rights in the &s;ubjects are ab&s;olutely at the di&s;po|&s;al of the &s;upreme civil power.</P>
<P>THE liberty of a &s;tate may be violated and abridged &s;everal ways. It is &s;o when a foreign authority, to whom the &s;tate owes not &s;ubjecti|on, claims and exerci&s;es a governing and con|trouling power over it. This is al&s;o the ca&s;e when a part of the &s;tate, without right, &s;eizes on the powers of government, or hinders the free exerci&s;e of them: or, when tho&s;e who are in|tru&s;ted with authority, &s;tretch their prerogatives beyond due bounds, to the en&s;laving of the peo|ple. If the whole authority of a &s;tate over its members be limited, as has been &s;hewn, much more is the authority of rulers &s;o, who have not the whole authority of the &s;tate put into their hands to be u&s;ed by them as they plea&s;e, but on|ly &s;o much of it as is judged to be needful to fit them to an&s;wer the end of their appointment.

<HI>The &s;upreme civil authority remains always in the community at large, who&s;e will and order is the &s;upreme law of the &s;tate.</HI> And they have al|ways a right, when their rulers are evidently un|faithful and unworthy of their tru&s;t, to re&s;train them and revoke their powers.&mdash;They have a right to alter and reform their laws when they are found to be pernicious; any law or compact to the contrary notwith&s;tanding. Civil rulers are indeed to be con&s;idered as the ordinary re|pre&s;entatives of the &s;tate, and the laws enacted by them as the will and law of the &s;tate, when the contrary does not appear: but &s;urely &s;uch laws ought not to &s;tand in force again&s;t the ma|nife&s;t will and intere&s;t of the community.&mdash;For a people to be &s;o en&s;laved, either to their <HI>rulers,</HI> or even their <HI>own laws,</HI> as not to be able to ex|erci&s;e their e&s;&s;ential right of &s;overeignty for their own &s;afety and welfare, is as incon&s;i&s;tent with civil liberty, as if they were en&s;laved to an ar|my, or to any foreign power. Whatever form of government a people may choo&s;e to be under, the &s;upreme civil authority remains always at|tached to, and diffu&s;ed through the whole body: nor can they give it up without injuring and en|&s;laving them&s;elves, their fellow-citizens and their po&s;terity, which they have no natural right to do.</P>
<P>IT is therefore a wi&s;e provi&s;ion in our frame of government, that an orderly way is left open, and pointed out, for the &s;tate to revi&s;e its civil con&s;titutio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> make &s;uch amendments as may be found nece&s;&s;ary.

are not, indeed, to be attempted for light rea&s;ons, &s;ince they are always attended with inconveni|ence and danger. But when the &s;afety and in|tere&s;t of a people requires that &s;uch alterations be made, they have an indefea&s;ible right to make them.</P>
<P>HAVING thus far con&s;idered the <HI>fir&s;t great branch</HI> of civil liberty, and then touched a little on the rights of a free &s;tate, I will now attend to the <HI>other branch,</HI> which includes the rights and privileges of the &s;everal members of a poli|tical body IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL AND PERSONAL CAPACITY.&mdash;Liberty is the right of every member, as well as of the whole body, or &s;y&s;tem. And a per&s;on may ju&s;tly be ac|counted a free citizen, when he is allowed to hold and u&s;e his natural rights and faculties, to|gether with the civil privileges <HI>proper to his rank</HI> in the commonwealth, according to his own judgment and plea&s;ure, in &s;uch ways as are con|&s;i&s;tent with his obligations to the community, and his fellow citizens, and with the ju&s;t and rea&s;onable laws of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE order and intere&s;t of a civil &s;ociety re|quire that there &s;hould be different ranks of men, with different civil rights and privileges annexed to them; and &s;ubject to different re|&s;trictions. Nor is the true liberty of any rank infringed by this &s;ubordination, but rather &s;ecu|red, improved and enjoyed by all to better ad|vantage. But though the &s;everal ranks in a po|litical
<PB N="22" REF="018526_0021_0FA7AC2EA7BA1310">
&s;y&s;tem may ri&s;e one above another in a long &s;cale of &s;ubordination, yet we may conve|niently di&s;tribute them all into two general cla&s;&s;|es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> RULERS and SUBJECTS. Indeed in a free &s;tate the right of authority and the duty of &s;ubjection are interwoven, and, as it were, incor|porated together through the whole &s;y&s;tem, &s;o that they are mutually tempered by each other. They who are ve&s;ted with mo&s;t authority are yet <HI>fellow-&s;ubjects</HI> with their inferiors, who are governed by them. They are not only alike &s;ubject to the law of GOD, but al&s;o to the law and authority of the &s;tate, who&s;e mini&s;ters they are. And the lowe&s;t orders of men have a right|ful &s;hare in that &s;overeignty or &s;upreme civil power which is lodged in and diffu&s;ed through the whole community.</P>
<P>As the bounds of civil liberty are determined by ju&s;t and rea&s;onable civil laws, it is plain that when RULERS are allowed freely to u&s;e the pow|ers committed to them for the public good, and enjoy the privileges annexed to their rank, they then enjoy that civil liberty which is their right. But when they are overawed and controuled in the exerci&s;e of their rightful authority, or are not allowed the privileges they have a right to, their civil liberty is then infringed. But as ru|lers have no rightful liberty to claim and exer|ci&s;e powers to which they are not entitled by law, or to violate the rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s, or to oppre&s;s the community or any of its mem|bers, by hindering them from holding and u&s;ing
<PB N="23" REF="018526_0022_0FA7AC2F696B5CF0">
their ju&s;t rights, their liberty is not infringed in the lea&s;t, if the &s;tate interpo&s;es its &s;overeign au|thority, when it is nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train them from effecting unrighteous and pernicious de|&s;igns; which, whenever they attempt, they act without authority. GOD never gave them au|thority for any &s;uch purpo&s;e: the people never meant to do it: they could not do it if they would: they had no &s;uch authority to give.</P>
<P>AND though SUBJECTS, as &s;uch, have no rightful claim to the peculiar civil privileges of <HI>rulers,</HI> they have yet a right to civil liberty, and to all the privileges of citizens of their rank, un|le&s;s they have forfeited them by &s;ome high mi&s;|demeanor. And they may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to en|joy this their right, when they are allowed the free u&s;e of their natural unalienable rights, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t important of which are, the rights of con|&s;cience; and al&s;o to &s;peak and act, to u&s;e and di&s;po&s;e of their property, to hold and enjoy eve|ry rightful privilege, without di&s;turbance or controul, in &s;uch ways as are not injurious to any, or contrary to the rea&s;onable laws of that civil body of which they are members. And though &s;uch laws as lay the &s;ubject under need|le&s;s and burden&s;ome re&s;traints may ju&s;tly be ac|counted an abridgment of liberty, yet no one has any rea&s;on to complain that he is denied the liberty of a free citizen, when he is re&s;trained by human laws and penalties, from vice and im|morality, and obliged to yield due obedience to civil authority, and ob&s;erve &s;uch ordinances, and
<PB N="24" REF="018526_0023_0FA7AC30277902D0">
pay &s;uch taxes; as are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of government, and to maintain the order, peace and welfare of the common wealth.</P>
<P>NATURAL and civil liberty is the right of every man and member of a civil community. But there is yet another branch which belongs peculiarly to chri&s;tians, and which we may therefore fitly term, <HI>CHRISTIAN LIBERTY.</HI></P>
<P>THE go&s;pel does not curtail any of our natu|ral rights, or civil privileges, but allows and ac|knowledges them, and ratifies the right which chri&s;tians in common with others have to the enjoyment of them. But the new covenant con|tains a grant of &s;pecial privileges, and tho&s;e of the highe&s;t importance. It calls us to, and in|ve&s;ts us with the "glorious liberty of the chil|dren of God." The apo&s;tle &s;eems to have had the peculiar privileges of chri&s;tians mo&s;t directly in his view, when he &s;aid in our text, "Brethren ye have been called to liberty." It &s;eems there|fore but fit that &s;ome di&s;tinct notice &s;hould be taken of the&s;e, though the time and pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion will not allow of enlargement.</P>
<P>THE liberty we are called to as chri&s;tians, does not in any mea&s;ure relax the obligation we are under to be &s;ubject to the authority and laws of GOD, and al&s;o to &s;ubmit our&s;elves to tho&s;e who, under him, have rightful authority, whe|ther economical, political, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical. But the go&s;pel calls us to liberty from the bonds of

guilt the condemning power and cur&s;e of the di|vine law, and from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> obligations to puni&s;h|ment which &s;in had laid us under, which is a mo&s;t mi&s;erable bondage. We are al&s;o called to li|berty from a &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubjection to the power of &s;in, and of Satan the God of this world, who rules in the children of di&s;obedience, and leads them captive at his will; than which what &s;la|very can be more wretched, abject and ignomi|nious? We are called al&s;o to liberty from a &s;la|vi&s;h &s;pirit in the &s;ervice of GOD, and of one another; &s;o that a chri&s;tian is not driven on in the way of his duty again&s;t his inclination, but acts with a cheerful, free, and ingenuous &s;pirit. "Where the &s;pirit of the Lord is there is liber|ty." We are al&s;o di&s;charged from &s;ubjection to any ma&s;ter or dictator on earth, in matters of faith and wor&s;hip; and are to acknowledge no law|giver to the church but Chri&s;t alone. We have liberty to u&s;e the ordinances in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t for the edification of his church, and to have communion with him, and his &s;aints in them, and that without any human inventions, or un|&s;criptural terms of communion impo&s;ed on us. Finally, we may think, and &s;peak, and act, and u&s;e our &s;piritual privileges with all freedom, ac|cording to the mea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and grace given to us; nor may any human authority for|bid or re&s;train us from it.</P>
<P>I HAVE taken the freedom to enlarge a little in opening the nature and &s;tating the extent and proper bounds of NATURAL, CIVIL, and CHRI|STIAN
<PB N="26" REF="018526_0025_0FA7AC324DD83C38">
LIBERTY; becau&s;e the right under&s;tand|ing hereof might, I conceive, be of great u&s;e to us: and at this day in particular, it may &s;eem to be a matter which needs to be con&s;idered with &s;ome &s;pecial attention. <HI>In the next place,</HI> I am to &s;hew "that we have been called to liberty." It belongs to us by virtue of a divine grant&mdash;we claim it as our RIGHT; and, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, we hold and enjoy it as our INHERITANCE. The expre&s;&s;ion "ye have been called to liberty," may be taken both ways, and may &s;ignify either that GOD has given us a <HI>right</HI> to liberty, or that he has given the <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>u&s;e</HI> of this right. In the former &s;en&s;e, he calls us to liber|ty, by declaring to us that it is his will that we be free, and requiring us to a&s;&s;ert and maintain our right. In the latter &s;en&s;e, he calls us to li|berty, when he gives us the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and breaks tho&s;e yokes of bondage which had been impo&s;ed upon us.</P>
<P>THAT God has called to the RIGHT of li|berty; that he allows us to claim and maintain it, again&s;t all who would bring us into bondage; that he favors the glorious cau&s;e, and would have us &s;tand up for it, is evident from the <HI>light of nature,</HI> and from the <HI>oracles of divine revelation.</HI></P>
<P>THE light of our own REASON and CON|SCIENCE, that "candle of the Lord" which he hath put within us, makes it plain that we have a right to be free. There is no need of
<PB N="27" REF="018526_0026_0FA7AC3268D2BAB8">
long and &s;ubtle trains of rea&s;oning in the ca&s;e. We appeal to the moral &s;en&s;e, the inward feel|ings and re&s;entments of every hone&s;t heart. Can it be right that men, made in the image of God &s;hould be &s;laves? That fellow &s;ervants of the &s;ame Lord &s;hould u&s;urp and tyrannize over one another? Are not the pretences urged to ju&s;tify &s;uch u&s;urpation &s;o weak, &s;o pitiful, &s;o un|fair, that it is a painful exerci&s;e of patience to a man of rea&s;on and virtue, and generous feelings, to have his under&s;tanding and heart affronted, and harrowed with them? It is true, the inte|re&s;ts of &s;ociety require &s;ubordination: but this deprives none of liberty, but helps all to enjoy it better. In &s;hort, if equity, requires us to do to others as we would that they &s;hould do to us; if the plaine&s;t and &s;ure&s;t dictates of our rea&s;on are to be believed; if the law of nature be of force, then liberty is our right; and con&s;equent|ly it is the will of God that we be free. Nor is it ea&s;y to determine, whether the inju&s;tice of tho&s;e who would put a yoke of bondage on their bre|thren, or the meanne&s;s of tho&s;e who would tamely &s;toop to take it on, be the greater re|proach to human nature.</P>
<P>IF we now turn our eye to the oracles of DIVINE REVELATION, we &s;hall find clear and manifold evidence that God approves and favors the cau&s;e of liberty, and that tyranny is mo&s;t offen&s;ive to him&mdash;This appears in his delivering the I&s;raelites from a &s;tate of mi&s;erable bondage, and puni&s;hing their oppre&s;&s;ors with a mighty

hand, and &s;tretched-out arm. It appears in the laws and form of government he gave them; whereby liberty and property were &s;ecured to every one. It appears in the awful threatnings denounced by the prophets again&s;t the en&s;lavers and oppre&s;&s;ors of mankind; and which have been terribly executed. It appears in the whole &s;train, &s;pirit, and tendency of the doctrine and religion taught and inculcated throughout the &s;criptures; which is to promote the practice of goodne&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth, with all other divine and &s;ocial virtues; and to di&s;&s;uade men from all acts of inju&s;tice or unkindne&s;s, where by the rights or liberties of any might be violated. It appears further, from expre&s;s directions and exhortations to chri&s;tians, that they &s;tand fa&s;t in their liberty&punc; and be not entangled with a yoke of bondage; nor be the &s;ervants of men; nor call any man ma&s;ter upon earth; nor exerci&s;e lordly dominion over one another. Finally, it appears from the example of Chri&s;t, and the apo|&s;tles, prophets, and holy men, who&s;e characters and conduct are recorded for our imitation; who &s;poke and acted with the mo&s;t ingenuous freedom, and mo&s;t rever&s;e to a ba&s;e &s;ervile &s;pirit. The&s;e hints might be copiou&s;ly illu&s;trated from the &s;criptures,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Stevens' election Sermon.</NOTE> which might be both in&s;tructive and entertaining. But I mu&s;t wave it.&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT this call to liberty, which we are now con&s;idering, may be under&s;tood to import God's
<PB N="29" REF="018526_0028_0FA7AC33E7DE5C20">
giving us the ACTUAL POSSESSION of, as well as a <HI>right</HI> to this invaluable privilege. And here this divine goodne&s;s de&s;erves our grateful notice, that, through the kind and wonderful di&s;po&s;als of providence, mankind enjoy &s;o much liberty. For though it is a melancholy truth that there is much tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion in the world, and all are more or le&s;s entangled with yokes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n|dage in &s;ome kind, and are not &s;o free <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they ought to be; yet it mu&s;t al&s;o be acknowledged, that as every degree of liberty which men enjoy, is the gift of God, &s;o there are none but have a &s;hare of this &s;weet ble&s;&s;ing; and indeed the greater part enjoy con&s;iderable degrees of it.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the de&s;potic claims of tyrants, we &s;ee that their penicious and oppre&s;&s;ive power is re&s;trained by God in ways innumerable. The&s;e fierce bea&s;ts are chained, their horns are &s;hort|ned, their mouths muzzled, and they are divert|ed from their purpo&s;es. By this means men often enjoy no &s;mall &s;hare of liberty, even under tho&s;e forms of government which are mo&s;t un|friendly to it.</P>
<P>IT is, however, to be ob&s;erved, that as God has a &s;overeign right to deal out his own gifts in what mea&s;ure and proportion he plea&s;es, &s;o he calls different men to different kinds and degrees of liberty. Though the <HI>natural rights</HI> of men may, in general, &s;eem much alike, they being, in this re&s;pect, "all FREE and EQUAL;" yet it is in different degrees that they are permitted to u&s;e them. According to the differen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> civil

con&s;titutions which men are under, their <HI>civil li|berty</HI> is larger, or more re&s;tricted.&mdash;And, indeed, under every form of government it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome ranks and denominations of men &s;hould be allowed more ample civil privileges than o|thers. And as to <HI>chri&s;tian liberty,</HI> this is the peculiar right and privilege of the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t: no others have any lot or portion in this matter. And though all chri&s;tians are <HI>fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e in|deed,</HI> and are by the &s;pecial grace of GOD, enti|tled and admitted to the liberties and privileges of his heavenly kingdom; yet all do not enjoy them in like mea&s;ure: nor is the liberty of any perfect in this world; but is more or le&s;s entan|gled and re&s;trained by the power of &s;in and Sa|tan, and the men and things of the world. It will, however, gradually work it&s;elf clear of all the&s;e clogs; and our call to the glorious liberty of the children of GOD, will, in the heavenly &s;tate, have its full effect.</P>
<P>As it is a great happine&s;s to a people when their civil con&s;titution and laws are favorable to civil and religious liberty; &s;o there is per|haps no part of the world more happy, in this re&s;pect, than the&s;e United States, or that have been called by Divine Providence to the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion and enjoyment of &s;uch a degree of liberty as we have been.</P>
<P>IF what has been offered under this fir&s;t head &s;hould &s;eem too long, ab&s;tru&s;e, and &s;peculative, I will endeavour to make &s;ome atonement by
<PB N="31" REF="018526_0030_0FA7AC35671DEE68">
being &s;horter, plainer, and more practical in what remains.</P>
<P>OUR SECOND GENERAL POINT is, "they who are called to liberty &s;hould be careful not to abu&s;e it for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h." They &s;hould not run wild becau&s;e they are free; or take encouragement to indulge them&s;elves in a lawle&s;s and licentious temper and practice.</P>
<P>IT is a great evidence of the weakne&s;s and folly of men that they, in general, can no better bear that &s;tate of freedom to which they are cal|led; and when they have &s;uch a price in their hands, they &s;o &s;eldom u&s;e it wi&s;ely and &s;oberly, and to advantage. Their lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions are ready to break out into wild exce&s;&s;es when they find them&s;elves free from outward re&s;traints. The apo&s;tle, well aware of this danger, has left this caution in the text, "u&s;e not liberty for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h." And St. Peter al&s;o &s;peaks to the &s;ame effect; "As free, but not u&s;ing your liberty for a cloak of maliciou&s;ne&s;s." We are plea&s;ed with the thought of being free; but how often do we &s;hew that we have not a heart rightly to improve our privileges? When we get the helm into our own hands, what wild cour&s;es do we often &s;teer. When we find our|&s;elves at liberty to direct our &s;teps, how prone are we to turn a&s;ide into crooked paths!</P>
<P>WE cannot therefore be too much on our guard again&s;t the&s;e licentious abu&s;es: for, be&s;ides
<PB N="32" REF="018526_0031_0FA7AC3628076FC0">
our liablene&s;s thereto, it &s;hould be con&s;idered that <HI>they are highly criminal.</HI> When we make an ill u&s;e of liberty, we &s;hew our&s;elves mo&s;t un|worthy to have it, and de&s;erve to have our talent taken from us. It is ungrateful to GOD, and injurious and uncharitable to men. It turns our glory into &s;hame, and expo&s;es to reproach that <HI>perfect law of liberty</HI> by which we profe&s;s to be governed.</P>
<P>THE abu&s;e of liberty draws after it al&s;o a train of the <HI>wor&s;t con&s;equences.</HI> It is, we may &s;ay, "the root of all evil." It makes our privileges become our grievances, and turns our ble&s;&s;ings into cur&s;es: yea, it de&s;troys liberty it&s;elf, and is an inlet to tyranny and &s;lavery. True liberty is a tender thing: it langui&s;hes and dies under li|centious abu&s;es. <HI>Rulers,</HI> by abu&s;ing their liber|ty, betray their tru&s;t; and their authority dege|nerates into tyranny. And when <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> abu&s;e their privileges, and become di&s;orderly, ungo|vernable, undutiful, factious, and irreligious, their &s;ocial union is greatly weakened, and they &s;uffer the wor&s;t effects of &s;lavery, while they have only an empty &s;hadow of freedom. It is true virtue, and religion, and &s;ubjection to the laws and ordinances of GOD, that can only pre|&s;erve the liberty of any people. Without this, declarations of rights and forms of government are vain: And I know not whether it be not better for a licentious people to be under a de&s;|potic government than any other. Such a peo|ple may well expect to come under &s;uch a go|vernment,
<PB N="33" REF="018526_0032_0FA7AC36E71D0020">

<P>No le&s;s prejudicial is the abu&s;e of <HI>religious liberty</HI> to the &s;piritual intere&s;ts of the chri&s;tian church. From this &s;ource an inundation of infidelity, and manifold corruption in doctrine, di&s;cipline, wor&s;hip, and practice, with mo&s;t un|charitable contentions, and &s;chi&s;ms, have i&s;&s;ued, which have made terrible havock in God's he|ritage. Hence&mdash;But I mu&s;t leave it to my hear|ers to pur&s;ue the&s;e reflections. The evils flow|ing from this &s;ource are &s;o many, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to give a detail of them.</P>
<P>For the like rea&s;on I can only &s;ugge&s;t a few &s;hort and general hints, re&s;pecting the <HI>&s;everal ways</HI> in which we might be in danger of abu&s;ing our liberty; a point highly worthy of &s;pecial attention, and which I had thought to have con|&s;idered more particularly: But on &s;uch a &s;ubject one would hardly know where to &s;top. I &s;hall therefore only &s;ay, we &s;hould take heed that <HI>Li|berty of thinking</HI> for our&s;elves, or the right of private judgment become not an occa&s;ion of infi|delity, or &s;ceptici&s;m, or of our being carried a|way with un&s;ound doctrines, and our minds cor|rupted from the &s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t. <HI>Li|berty of &s;peaking</HI> our thoughts mu&s;t not be abu&s;ed to the di&s;honor of God, and religion and virtue&punc;
<PB N="34" REF="018526_0033_0FA7AC37A70A1460">
to the encouragement of vice, or hurtful errors; to the detriment of the commonwealth; or to the injury, grievance, or &s;candal of any one. <HI>Liberty of con&s;cience</HI> mu&s;t not be abu&s;ed into a pretence for neglecting religious wor&s;hip, pro|phaning God's &s;abbaths and ordinances, or refu|&s;ing to do our part for the &s;upport of government and the means of religious in&s;truction. In a word,&mdash;as we would avoid the abu&s;e of liberty, let us all take heed that we u&s;e it not <HI>irreligiou&s;ly,</HI> by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing God's commands, or by neglect|ing or prophaning his wor&s;hip and ordinances; <HI>nor undutifully,</HI> by refu&s;ing due Honor and &s;ub|jection to rightful authority, in families, churches or commonwealth: <HI>nor injuriou&s;ly, unkindly, and uncharitably,</HI> to the wrong, the damage, the grief and offence of our brethren: <HI>nor inordi|nately,</HI> exceeding the bounds of moderation, &s;o|briety and expediency, even in things that are in them&s;elves lawful.</P>
<P>As a pre&s;ervative from the&s;e, and all other a|bu&s;es, let it be our care thoroughly to imbibe the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, "that perfect law of liber|ty," and have our &s;entiments, our temper, and manners, formed by its divine doctrines and rules. Let us cheri&s;h in our hearts the fear and love of God, with that benevolence and charity which is the fulfilling of the law, and which only can effectually correct the inordinacy of tho&s;e &s;elfi&s;h affections which are the malignant root of the&s;e abu&s;es. And, to add no more, let it be our care to under&s;tand, di&s;tinctly, the nature and extent
<PB N="35" REF="018526_0034_0FA7AC391CCA9EE8">
of our liberty, and of our duty, in their connec|tion and con&s;i&s;tency with each other; and that our freedom can no otherwi&s;e be maintained and exerci&s;ed, &s;o as to be any real privilege, than by our being the &s;ervants of God, and "by love &s;erving one another."</P>
<P>THIS was the THIRD POINT contained in our text, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;That it is our duty, and no infringe|ment of our liberty, to <HI>&s;erve one another in love.</HI> Though God has made us free, yet it is no di&s;|paragement to be, <HI>in a liberal &s;en&s;e,</HI> &s;ervants to each other: nay, it is our honor to be &s;o&mdash;this gives true dignity to men of the highe&s;t rank. It is a very honorable character given to David, a great and excellent King, that he SERVED his generation by the will of GOD&mdash;And a far greater King, even David's Lord, and the heir of all things, when he a&s;&s;umed our fle&s;h, and dwelt among us, "came to mini&s;ter," and "was with us as one that &s;erveth." We ought, as the apo&s;|tle directs, to "be all of us &s;ubject one to ano|ther." Rulers, as has been ob&s;erved, are all of them FELLOW SUBJECTS with other members of the civil body, and hold their authority under the &s;tate. They who exerci&s;e the highe&s;t ordi|nary powers of government do it as the <HI>tru&s;tees</HI> and <HI>&s;ervants</HI> of the people; and it is their duty to &s;erve the Commonwealth faithfully, and not tyrannize over any. And it is no le&s;s the duty of every one, whatever his rank may be, to per|form the &s;ervices properly incumbent on him, with like fidelity. But as the duty of mutual

&s;ubjection was con&s;idered at large upon the la&s;t anniver&s;ary of this kind, I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no further upon it.</P>
<P>THERE is one thing, however, our text &s;ug|ge&s;ts, relative to the mutual &s;ervice required of us, which &s;hould not be pa&s;&s;ed over unnoticed: and that is the <HI>principle</HI> by which we are there|in to be moved and actuated. "BY LOVE <HI>&s;erve one another."</HI> Love mu&s;t be the vital &s;pring to put every member of the body in motion, and &s;et the whole &s;y&s;tem at work in a circulation of &s;ervices, and then they will be all free. We act mo&s;t freely when we are prompted by love. If we have a &s;incere and warm affection one to ano|ther, our &s;ervices will not be performed with &s;lavi&s;h reluctance, but in the full enjoyment of liberty. A ruler, or a &s;ubject, who is of a truly public &s;pirit, who tenders the intere&s;t of his fel|low-citizens, and &s;ympathizes with them in their joys and &s;orrows, will rejoice in an opportunity of &s;erving them; nor will he grudge the pains it co&s;ts him. Love makes his &s;ervices ea&s;y, plea|&s;ant and free: and he never enjoys his liberty more to his own &s;atisfaction, than when he is mo&s;t engaged in the &s;ervice of his generation.</P>
<P>THE REFLECTIONS with which it is time to clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e mu&s;t be confined to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>

And though we do not pre&s;ume to &s;ay that there is nothing ami&s;s or defective in our civil con&s;titu|tion; (it is the prerogative of God alone to have his work all perfect) yet the form of our government, and &s;pirit of our laws are, to &s;peak mode&s;tly, favorable to the free enjoyment of our natural rights, &s;o far as can con&s;i&s;t with our po|litical union, and the intere&s;t of the Common|wealth. And we &s;hould be unthankful to GOD and man, not to be &s;en&s;ible of, and own the wi&s;|dom and fidelity of tho&s;e who had the chief hand in this important and arduous work.

by human laws, which have done &s;o much hurt in the world.

If they are faithful they may expect to di&s;plea&s;e &s;ome: but they will have the applau&s;e of their own con&s;ciences, and of the be&s;t friends of their coun|try: their children will ri&s;e up and call them ble&s;&s;ed, and GOD him&s;elf will think on them for good. "The armour of light" will repel the darts of calumny which may be thrown at them. They will only need to &s;tand forth in open day. The light will render them invulnerable; and their being known will be their &s;ecurity.&mdash;And

GOD forbid that any of us &s;hould be back|ward to &s;upport them in their faithful endea|vours; or that we &s;hould cea&s;e to pray for them, that GOD would be with them: that their hearts may be encouraged; and their hands &s;trengthened with a double portion of his &s;pi|rit: that they may be in&s;pired with the wi&s;dom, integrity, fortitude, and unfainting re&s;olution ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pro&s;ecute and accompli&s;h their de&s;igns for the public good. <Q>We wi&s;h them a ble&s;&s;ing from the hou&s;e of the Lord; yea, we ble&s;s them in the name of the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>THIS day may well be accounted the day of the gladne&s;s of our hearts. We enjoy, at length, the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and liberty:&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ings;&mdash;for which; &s;aints, now with God, have ear|ne&s;tly prayed&mdash;heroes, of glorious memory; have fought and bled&mdash;and patriots have worn out them&s;elves with care; travail and exertion. The joy of reaping the harve&s;t which has been &s;own and watered with &s;o much tears and blood, is re&s;erved for us. This day, UNITED AMERI|CA &s;ees the i&s;&s;ue and fruit of her travailing throes, and is &s;atisfied. The &s;ight of &s;o &s;weet and lovely a birth, comforts and rejoices her, after her agonizing labor.</P>
<P>THIS day, we have the happine&s;s to &s;ee our CONGREGATION, even the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly of the commonwealth, e&s;tabli&s;hed before the Lord&mdash;our NOBLES from among our&s;elves&mdash;and our GOVERNORS proceeding from the mid&s;t of
<PB N="49" REF="018526_0048_0FA7AC43A6C17E58">
us. We view this augu&s;t body as repre&s;enting the whole republic, ve&s;ted with its maje&s;ty and authority; the di&s;tinct branches of which u|nite-and concentre in the GOVERNOR, the com|mon repre&s;entative of the whole &s;tate. As his EXCELLENCY and his HONOR are here pre&s;ent, it would &s;eem &s;carce decent for us to give them their due encomium, or to expre&s;s freely how worthy we e&s;teem them of that pre-eminence to which they are advanced; but their continued and often repeated election to the highe&s;t &s;eats in the Commonwealth, &s;peaks louder and more &s;ignificantly than words can, the peculiar e&s;teem and confidence of the people, and in &s;uch a way as leaves no &s;u&s;picion of flattery.</P>
<P>WE regard his EXCELLENCY in particular, as mo&s;t eminently authorized to act as the guar|dian of our rights, and take care that <HI>the Repub|lic receive no detriment.</HI> His prerogatives and powers we con&s;ider as a wi&s;e provi&s;ion for our &s;ecurity again&s;t the pernicious effects of that nar|row policy which may prompt &s;ome to aim at &s;erving their own particular connections in ways prejudicial to the general intere&s;t, or injurious to other parts of the &s;tate&mdash;Nor do we wi&s;h that the due exerci&s;e of the&s;e powers and prerogatives &s;hould be cramped or di&s;couraged; but that they be exerted with all freedom and firmne&s;s for the good of the people, whenever it &s;hall be need|ful. It is, we doubt not, his &s;incere aim to im|prove tho&s;e talents with which GOD has di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him, in promoting the true intere&s;t of
<PB N="50" REF="018526_0049_0FA7AC446B57E6C8">
the Commonwealth, and of the United States.&mdash;May he have the &s;ublime &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes, and the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his endeavours, to &s;erve his generation.&mdash;And the honorable COUNCIL will, we tru&s;t, be always ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t and co-operate in the&s;e ar|duous and important &s;ervices, with their wi&s;e, upright, and faithful advice.</P>
<P>THE honorable SENATORS and REPRESEN|TATIVES of the Commonwealth, who &s;u&s;tain and exerci&s;e &s;o great a &s;hare of its authority, and in whom the people repo&s;e &s;o much confidence, will not take it ami&s;s to be reminded of the ex|pectations and ju&s;t claims of the State, that its intere&s;ts be faithfully attended to and pur&s;ued by them, not only in the elections of this day, but in all other matters on which they may afterwards have occa&s;ion to act. Their views will be as exten&s;ive as the field of &s;ervice they have before them; and not only the intere&s;ts of their par|ticular con&s;tituents, but that of the whole Com|monwealth, yea, of the whole United States, will be duly regarded in their deliberations and re|&s;olves&mdash;liberality of &s;entiment, love to their coun|try, a truly public &s;pirit, with untainted, un&s;haken integrity, will give dignity to their proceedings, and throw light upon their paths: whether they con|&s;ider them&s;elves as <HI>the mini&s;ters of God,</HI> or <HI>the tru&s;tees of the people,</HI> they can no other wi&s;e &s;up|port the dignity of their character, or an&s;wer the ju&s;t expectations of God and man, than by a faithful di&s;charge of the duties of their &s;tation;

nor &s;hould it be forgotten that all mankind of what ever rank, mu&s;t another day &s;tand before an impartial tribunal, where an account will be taken how every talent has been improved, and a recompence will be adjudged to every one ac|cording as his work &s;hall be. Happy then will he be beyond expre&s;&s;ion, who has maintained his integrity in a corrupt and en&s;naring world; who has kept "a con&s;cience void of offence to|wards GOD and towards man;" who can hold up his face before the Judge and &s;ay, <Q>Remem|ber, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart;</Q> and who will receive from him an an&s;wer of acquittance and approbation, <Q>Well done good and faith|ful &s;ervant, enter into the joy of thy Lord.</Q></P>
<P>WILL this grave and venerable audience bear with me while I add one reflection of general concernment;&mdash;that if we would enjoy true li|berty, we mu&s;t not only maintain our civil pri|vileges, and guard again&s;t a licentious and mali|cious abu&s;e of them, but it is above all things nece&s;&s;ary that we be delivered by GOD's &s;pecial grace from the bondage of guilt, and the &s;lavery and &s;ervice of &s;in and Satan, and that we be call|ed effectually to the &s;piritual freedom of the chil|dren of GOD. Little rea&s;on &s;hall we have to boa&s;t of liberty, or ble&s;s our&s;elves in our external privileges, if we are the ignominious &s;ervants of corruption. This <HI>&s;piritual liberty,</HI> Chri&s;t has obtained for all his true di&s;ciples: and it can no otherwi&s;e be enjoyed by any of us, than by
<PB N="52" REF="018526_0051_0FA7AC45EAB2F438">
<Q>taking his yoke upon us, learning of him, and continuing in his word</Q>&mdash;Then &s;hall <Q>we know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make us free indeed.</Q> It is the true Chri&s;tian alone who is the LORD'S FREE MAN, and a denizon of the new Jeru&s;alem. An honor and privilege to which we cannot maintain our claim, unle&s;s we realize our profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tanity, by &s;er|ving the Lord Chri&s;t with all good fidelity, and &s;erving one another in love. Be this the object of our greate&s;t care and ambition. We may then with hope and earne&s;t expectation, wait for the day of our complete redemption. The GRAND JUBILEE will at length be proclaimed by the &s;ound of the Arch-Angel's trumpet, which will call the &s;ons and heirs of GOD to the CONSUM|MATE LIBERTY of his heavenly kingdom, and induce them to the inheritance incorruptable, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, re&s;erved for them.</P>
<P>MAY this be the lot of us all, through the grace of GOD our Saviour.</P>
