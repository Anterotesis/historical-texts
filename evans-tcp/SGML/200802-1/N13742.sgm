<P>IT mu&s;t afford no &s;mall plea&s;ure to a bene|volent mind in the mid&s;t of a war, which daily makes &s;o much havock with the human &s;pecies, to reflect, that the &s;mall-pox which once proved equally fatal to thou&s;ands, has been checked in its career, and in a great degree &s;ub|dued by the practice of INOCULATION.</P>
<P>It is foreign to my purpo&s;e to deliver to you the hi&s;tory of this art, and to mark the various &s;teps that have attended its progre&s;s to its pre&s;ent &s;tate of improvement. We have yet to lament the want of uniformity and of equal &s;ucce&s;s in the practice of it among phy&s;icians. A great number of pamphlets have been written upon the &s;ubject without exhau&s;ting it. There is &s;till ample room left for the man of genius to exerci&s;e his talents for ob&s;ervation and rea|&s;oning on it. The facts I mean to lay before you are &s;o incon&s;iderable, compared with what &s;till remain to be known upon this &s;ubject, that I have to reque&s;t, when your knowledge in it is compleat|ed,

<P>I. Formerly there were great difficulties in the choice of the &s;ubjects for <HI>Inoculation.</HI> But experience teaches us that it may be practi&s;ed in every &s;tage of life, and in almo&s;t every con|dition of the human body.&mdash;In infancy the pe|riods before and after dentition are to be prefer|ed.&mdash;But we &s;eldom &s;ee any great inconvenien|cies from &s;ubmiting to the general nece&s;&s;ity of inoculating children between the ages of three
<PB N="6" REF="017362_0006_0FA11282C665D140">
months and two years.&mdash;Indeed we often &s;ee children cut three or four teeth during the pre|paration and eruptive fever without the lea&s;t ad|dition being made to any of the trouble&s;ome &s;ym|ptoms which accompany the &s;mall-pox. There is one inconvenience attending the choice of the fir&s;t months of infancy for inoculating, and that is the matter often fails of producing the di&s;order in &s;uch young &s;ubjects. I have frequently failed in two or three attempts to communicate the di&s;order to children under four months old with the &s;ame matter that has &s;ucceeded in a dozen other patients inoculated at the &s;ame time.&mdash;When the Inocu|lation &s;ucceeds in &s;uch tender &s;ubjects, they ge|nerally have le&s;s fever, and fewer pu&s;tules than are common in any future period of life.</P>
<P>Altho' a phy&s;ician would prefer a patient in good health to any other as a &s;ubject for Inoculation, yet ca&s;es often occur in which it is nece&s;&s;ary to communicate the &s;mall-pox while the body is affected with &s;ome other di&s;order. I can with plea&s;ure inform you, that the &s;mall-pox is rendered &s;o perfectly &s;afe by Inoculation, that there are few chronic di&s;ea&s;es which &s;hould be con&s;idered as ob&s;tacles in the way of it. I have inoculated patients labouring under a
<PB N="7" REF="017362_0007_0FA11283D13BBE40">
tertian fever, ob&s;tructed vi&s;cera, the hooping cough, the hypochondria&s;is, the a&s;thma, the itch and other cutaneous di&s;orders, and even pregnant women with the &s;ame, and in &s;ome in|&s;tances, with greater &s;ucce&s;s than per&s;ons in perfect health. Doct. <HI>Cullen</HI> informs us that he has &s;een Inoculation &s;ucceed in &s;crophulous patients. A phy&s;ician in <HI>Jamaica</HI> informed me that he had inoculated Negroes with &s;ucce&s;s in the wor&s;t &s;tage of the Yaws.&mdash;To the&s;e facts I mu&s;t add one more extraordinary than any that has been yet men|tioned.&mdash;Doct. <HI>Brown,</HI> my late colleague in the care of the military ho&s;pitals, informed me, that he had &s;een Inoculation &s;ucceed in patients who were &s;eized, after the infection was communicated, with the ho&s;pital fever.&mdash;The preparation of the body &s;hould be accommodated to the di&s;ea&s;e which affects it. Some phy&s;icians have thought the &s;mall-pox received in this way, was a remedy for other di&s;ea&s;es, but my experience has not confirm|ed this opinion. On the contrary I am di&s;po&s;ed to think that no other change is produced by Inoculation than by the regimen and medicines that are u&s;ed to prepare the body for the &s;mall-pox. Nor does the &s;mall-pox during its conti|nuance afford any &s;ecurity again&s;t the attacks of other di&s;ea&s;es. I have &s;een the mo&s;t alarming
<PB N="8" REF="017362_0008_0FA112844942A6B8">
complication of the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les in the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;ons commonly prefered for Inocu|lation in this country are the &s;pring and fall. It may be practi&s;ed with equal &s;afety in the win|ter, a due regard being had to the temperature of the air in the preparation of the body.</P>
<P>The principal objection to inoculating in the &s;ummer months in this climate, ari&s;es from the frequency of bilious di&s;orders at that &s;ea|&s;on, to which the preparation nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;mall-pox probably di&s;po&s;es the body. This cau|tion applies more directly to children who at a certain age are more &s;ubject than grown people to a di&s;order in their bowels in warm weather.</P>
<P>II. The methods of communicating the &s;mall-pox by Inoculation, have been different in different countries and in the different aeras of its progre&s;s towards its pre&s;ent &s;tage of im|provement. The &s;cab, do&s;&s;el of lint, and the thread impregnated with variolous matter and bound up in a ga&s;h in the arm, have been laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017362_0009_0FA112850E7BCB50">
We are indebted to Mr. <HI>Sutton</HI> for the mode of communicating it by a &s;light puncture with the point of a lancet or needle dipt in fre&s;h matter. As it is difficult &s;ometimes to procure matter in a fre&s;h &s;tate, I have been led to u&s;e it with equal &s;ucce&s;s by pre&s;erving it on lint in a box, and moi&s;tning it with cold water ju&s;t before I u&s;ed it. Matter may be kept in this way for a month without loo&s;ing its in|fectious quality, provided it is not expo&s;ed to heat or moi&s;ture. The former de&s;troys its power of infecting as certainly as the &s;alt of tartar de|&s;troys the acidity of vinegar. Moi&s;ture by re|maining long upon the matter, probably de&s;troys its virulence by &s;ubjecting it to fermentation. The longer matter has been kept in a general way, the longer the di&s;tance will be between the time of communicating the di&s;order and the eruptive fever. It will be proper always to yield to the prejudices of our patients in favour of matter taken from per&s;ons who have but few pu&s;tules. But I am per&s;uaded from repeated ob|&s;ervations, that the di&s;ea&s;e is no ways influenced by this circum&s;tance. I am &s;atisfied likewi&s;e that there is no difference between the effects of the matter whether it be taken in its watery or purulent &s;tate. The puncture &s;hould not be larger than is &s;ufficient to draw one drop of blood.
<PB N="10" REF="017362_0010_0FA112861E731EC8">
&mdash;No pla&s;ter nor bandage &s;hould be applied over it. It &s;hould be made in the left arm of all &s;ubjects. The objections to inoculating in the leg are too obvious to be mentioned. I have heard of the di&s;ea&s;e being communicated by rub|bing the dry &s;kin with the matter. My own ob&s;ervations upon this &s;ubject give me rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the facts that are contained in books re|lative to this mode of infecting the body. I have bound large pieces of lint dipt in fre&s;h matter for 24 hours upon the arm without producing the di&s;order. A practitioner of phy&s;ic in New-Jer|&s;ey informed me that he once gave a con&s;iderable quantity of fre&s;h variolous matter in a do&s;e of phy&s;ic without infecting his patient. I &s;u&s;pect the matter that produces the di&s;ea&s;e is of the &s;ame nature with certain poi&s;ons, which require to be brought in contact with a wound or &s;ore in the body before they produce their effects. I deliver this opinion with diffidence. The &s;ubject &s;tands in need of more experiments and inve&s;ti|gation.</P>
<P>III. I come now to con&s;ider the be&s;t me|thod of preparing the body for the &s;mall-pox&mdash;This mu&s;t be done 1&s;t by DIET, and 2dly by MEDICINE.&mdash;The DIET &s;hould con&s;i&s;t chiefly of vegetables. I have never &s;een any inconvenience
<PB N="11" REF="017362_0011_0FA1128A28DFF188">
from the free u&s;e of milk as a part of the pre|parative diet. In &s;ome habits where a morbid acid prevails in the &s;tomach, we may indulge our patients in a little weak fle&s;h broth two or three times a week with &s;afety.&mdash;Tea, coffee, and even weak chocolate with bi&s;cuit or <HI>dry</HI> toa&s;t may be u&s;ed as u&s;ual by per&s;ons accu&s;tom|ed to that kind of aliment. Wine and &s;pirits of all kinds &s;hould be withheld from our pati|ents during the preparation.&mdash;The more ace&s;cent their drinks are, the better. It is unnece&s;&s;ary that this change in the diet &s;hould take place 'till a day or two before the time of commu|nicating the di&s;order. The &s;y&s;tem accommodates to a vegetable and low diet in the cour&s;e of three weeks or a month, &s;o as to defeat in &s;ome mea&s;ure the advantages we expected from it.&mdash;The good effects of it appear to depend in a great degree upon the <HI>&s;uddenne&s;s</HI> with which we oblige our patients to conform to it. For this rea&s;on when we are called upon to inoculate per|&s;ons who have lived more than three or four weeks upon a low diet, we &s;hould always direct them to live a few days upon animal food before we communicate the di&s;order to them. By the&s;e means we may produce all the good effects of the <HI>&s;udden</HI> change in the diet I have already men|tioned. 2. The MEDICINES mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed
<PB N="12" REF="017362_0012_0FA1128A79A89AD8">
to prepare the body for the &s;mall-pox are Anti|mony and Mercury. The latter has had the preference and has been given in large quantities under a notion of its being a &s;pecific antidote to the variolous matter. Many objections might be made to this opinion, I &s;hall mention only three.</P>
<P N="1">1. We often &s;ee the di&s;order in a high degree after the &s;y&s;tem is fully impregnated with mercury.</P>
<P N="2">2. We often &s;ee the &s;ame &s;alutary effects of mercury when given before the di&s;order is communicated to the body, that we perceive when it is given after Inoculation in which ca&s;e we are &s;ure the mercury cannot enter into mixture with the variolous matter &s;o as to de|&s;troy it.</P>
<P N="3">3. If mercury acted &s;pecifically in de&s;troy|ing the variolous matter, it would render every other part of the preparation unnece&s;&s;ary, but this we know is not the ca&s;e, for the neglect or improper u&s;e of the vegetable diet or cool regimen is often attended with an extraordinary number, or virulence of the &s;mall-pox even in tho&s;e ca&s;es where mercury is given in the large&s;t quantity.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="017362_0013_0FA1128B035A1BC8">
The way in which mercury prepares the body for the &s;mall-pox &s;eems to be by promot|ing the &s;everal excretions, particularly that by per&s;piration, which by dimini&s;hing the quantity of the fluids and weakening the tone of the &s;olids, renders the &s;y&s;tem le&s;s liable to a plentiful e|ruption of the &s;mall-pox. But I object to the u&s;e of this medicine for the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. It effectually deprives us of all the be|nefits of the cool regimen, for mercury we know always <HI>di&s;po&s;es</HI> the &s;y&s;tem to take cold.</P>
<P N="2">2. It &s;ubjects patients after Inoculation to trouble&s;ome and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, dangerous glan|dular &s;wellings. This will readily be admitted by all who know the tendency mercury has to &s;timulate the glandular parts of the body.</P>
<P N="3">3. All the good effects of&punc; mercury may be procured by PURGES which do not &s;ubject the body to either of the above mentioned incon|veniencies.</P>
<P>The PURGES may be &s;uited to the con&s;ti|tutions, and in &s;ome ca&s;es even to the inclina|tions of our patients. I have &s;een jalap&mdash;rhu|barb&mdash;&s;enna&mdash;manna&mdash;aloes&mdash;&s;oluble tartar&mdash;Glauber and Ep&s;om &s;alts&mdash;the butternut pill&mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="017362_0014_0FA1128CCA74C5E8">
all given with equal &s;ucce&s;s. The quantity &s;hould be &s;ufficient to procure three or four &s;tools every day. A little magne&s;ia &s;hould always be mixed with rhubarb and jalap in preparing children. It will be &s;ufficient for the mothers and nur&s;es of infants to conform &s;trictly to the vegetable diet. I have never &s;een any advantages from giving them even a &s;ingle do&s;e of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that the quality&mdash;do&s;e&mdash;and number of purges are to be determined by the age&mdash;&s;ex&mdash;and habits of our patients. A con&s;titution infeebled with a previ|ous di&s;ea&s;e forbids the u&s;e of purges, and requires medicines of a re&s;torative kind. Patients afflicted with cutaneous di&s;orders bear larger and more frequent do&s;es of phy&s;ic than are indicated in more healthy &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In adult &s;ubjects of a plethoric habit, blood|letting is very u&s;eful on the third or fourth day after Inoculation. We are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that every fat per&s;on labours under a plethora. A moderate degree of fat is &s;o far from rendering the di&s;ea&s;e more violent, e&s;pecially in children, that I think I have generally found &s;uch &s;ubjects have the &s;mall-pox more favourably than others.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="017362_0015_0FA1128DCD80B9E0">
Moderate exerci&s;e in the open air &s;hould be u&s;ed during the preparation. But hard labour and every thing that promotes &s;weat or fatigue as al&s;o the extremes of heat and cold, &s;hould be avoided.</P>
<P>IV. We come now to con&s;ider the treat|ment of the body during the eruptive fever. On the eighth day after Inoculation our pa|tients are <HI>generally</HI> &s;eized with the common &s;ym|ptoms of fever. Sometimes this fever appears on the &s;ixth and &s;eventh day after Inoculation. But when it is irregular it is often delayed 'till the ninth and tenth days. I have &s;een many in|&s;tances of it on the fourteenth, a few on the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth, and <HI>one</HI> ca&s;e in which it did not come on 'till the eighteenth day after the infection was communicated to the body.&mdash;The place where the puncture was made with the lancet or needle generally &s;erves as an har|binger of the approaching fever. A &s;light in|flammation appears about it and a pock ri&s;es up in the center. But this remark is liable to &s;ome objections. I have &s;een <HI>four</HI> in|&s;tances in which the fever came on at the ex|pected time, and the di&s;order went thro' all its &s;tages with the greate&s;t regularity, and yet there
<PB N="16" REF="017362_0016_0FA1128E19AD2A78">
was no &s;ign of an inflammation or pock near the &s;pot where the puncture was made; even the puncture it&s;elf became invi&s;ible.&mdash;On the o|ther hand we &s;ometimes &s;ee an inflammation and pock on the arm appear on the eighth and ninth days without any fever accompanying them. Some phy&s;icians pretend that this inflammation and &s;olitary pock are &s;ufficient to con&s;titute the di&s;ea&s;e, but repeated experience has taught me to be very cautious in relying upon the&s;e equivocal marks. It is true, I have &s;ometimes &s;een patients &s;ecured again&s;t the &s;mall-pox both in the natural way and by Inoculation where the&s;e marks have ap|peared; but I have as often &s;een &s;uch patients &s;eized afterwards with the &s;mall-pox in the natural way to the great di&s;tre&s;s of families and mortification of phy&s;icians.&mdash;Upon this account I make it a con&s;tant practice to advi&s;e a &s;econd or third Ino|culation where a fever and eruption have been wanting.&mdash;As the ab&s;ence of the&s;e &s;ymptoms is probably occa&s;ioned by the weakne&s;s or age of the variolous matter, or the too high &s;tate of pre|paration of the body, we &s;hould always guard a|gain&s;t both. by making the puncture the &s;econd time with <HI>fre&s;h</HI> matter&mdash;by &s;ubjecting our pa|tients to a <HI>le&s;s</HI> ab&s;temious diet, and by giving fewer do&s;es of phy&s;ic. I have heard it remarked
<PB N="17" REF="017362_0017_0FA1128EC41B1620">
that if a &s;light redne&s;s, and a &s;mall pimple ap|peared on the arm on the third day after Inocula|tion, it was a &s;ign the matter had infected the whole con&s;titution. I acknowledge I have often &s;een a greater degree of redne&s;s on the third than on the &s;econd day after Inoculation, but I have not been able to e&s;tabli&s;h a diagno&s;tic mark from it, for I have &s;een the di&s;ea&s;e produced on the u&s;ual days where the redne&s;s has appeared on the &s;econd day&mdash;and in &s;ome ca&s;es where it has not appeared until the eruptive fever.</P>
<P>I am led here unwillingly to di&s;cu&s;s the old que&s;tion, Is it po&s;&s;ible to have the &s;mall-pox in the natural way after Inoculation?&mdash;In many of the ca&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;mall-pox from Inoculation, it is probable the matter has been taken from the chicken-pox which re&s;embles the &s;mall-pox in many of its peculiarities, but in none more than that of leaving pits or marks on the &s;kin. But there are certainly ca&s;es where there are the mo&s;t irrefragable proofs of the in|fection implanted by Inoculation being of a vari|olous nature, where the di&s;order has been after|wards taken in the natural way. In the&s;e ca&s;es I would &s;uppo&s;e the variolous matter produced on|ly a topical or cuticular di&s;order. We &s;ee &s;ome|thing analogous to this in nur&s;es who attend pati|ents
<PB N="18" REF="017362_0018_0FA1128F856CAFE8">
in the &s;mall-pox. But further&mdash;this topical or cuticular infection may be produced by art in per&s;ons who have had the &s;mall-pox in the natural way. Some years ago I made a puncture on my left hand with a lancet moi&s;tened with va|riolous matter. On the eighth day an inflamma|tion appeared on the place accompanied with an efflore&s;cence in the neighbourhood of it which extended about two inches in every direction from the &s;pot where the puncture was made. On the 11th day I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find two pocks (if I may venture to call them &s;uch) the one on the out&s;ide of my fourth finger on my left hand, and the other on my forehead. They remained there for &s;everal days but without filling with matter, and then dropped off rather in the form of a &s;oft wart than of a common &s;cab.&mdash;Doct. <HI>Way</HI> of Wilmington repeated the &s;ame experi|ment upon him&s;elf, but with an i&s;&s;ue to his cu|rio&s;ity more extraordinary than that I have ju&s;t now related. On the eighth day after he had made a puncture on his hand, a pock appeared on the &s;pot, which in the u&s;ual time filled with matter, from which he inoculated &s;everal children, who &s;icken'd at the u&s;ual time, and went thro' all the common &s;tages and &s;ymptoms of the &s;mall-pox&mdash;It would &s;eem from the&s;e facts that it is nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="19" REF="017362_0019_0FA112909AA1E2E8">
the &s;mall-pox &s;hould produce &s;ome impre&s;|&s;ion upon the <HI>whole</HI> &s;y&s;tem in order to render it ever afterwards incapable of receiving an impre&s;|&s;ion of a &s;imilar nature. A fever and an erup|tion therefore &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e. As the inflammation of the arm on the eighth day is a &s;ign of the <HI>topical</HI> and cuticular infection, &s;o an eruption (tho' ever &s;o &s;mall) &s;eems to be the only certain &s;ign of the infection of the <HI>whole</HI> &s;y&s;tem. The eruption is the more deci&s;ive in its report in proportion as it comes out and goes off in the u&s;ual manner of the &s;mall-pox in the natural way. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where pati|ents have been &s;ecured again&s;t a &s;econd attack of the di&s;order, where there have been no <HI>obvious</HI> fever or <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> eruption, I think I have ob&s;erved an unu&s;ual inflammation, and a copious and long continued di&s;charge of matter from the arm. Perhaps this may &s;erve as an outlet of the matter, which in other ca&s;es produces the fever and e|ruption. I am the more di&s;po&s;ed to embrace this opinion from the te&s;timony which &s;everal authors have left us of the effects of ulcers in &s;ecuring the body from the infection of the plague. The ef|fects of i&s;&s;ues are &s;till more to our purpo&s;e. We ob&s;erve a plentiful di&s;charge of matter from them every time the body is expo&s;ed to cold, and

the febrile effects of it upon the &s;y&s;tem are there by frequently obviated.&mdash;How far a ratio exi&s;ts between the degrees of inflammation and the di&s;|charge of matter from the arm, and the degrees of fever and eruption, mu&s;t be determined by future and very accurate ob&s;ervations.

The fever which produces the eruption is generally of the inflammatory kind. It &s;ome|times therefore comes on with the &s;ymptoms of great heat, preceded with chilline&s;s, determina|tion to the head and brea&s;t, and a full hard pul&s;e. The remedies proper in this ca&s;e are</P>
<P>A. Bloodletting. The quantity to be drawn mu&s;t be regulated by the violence of the &s;ym|ptoms,&mdash;the con&s;titution&mdash;habits, and even coun|try of the patient, and by the &s;ea&s;on of the year.&mdash;I have never found more than one bleed|ing to the quantity of 12 or 14 ounces nece&s;|&s;ary in any &s;tage or degree of the eruptive fever of the &s;mall-pox by Inoculation.</P>
<P>B. Cool air is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence in the eruptive fever. The u&s;e of this remedy in fevers marks an aera not only in the manage|ment of the &s;mall pox but in medicine. The degrees of cold &s;hould always be increa&s;ed in proportion to the violence of the fever.&mdash;Stove-rooms, &s;o common in this country, &s;hould be care|fully avoided. The more we oblige our patients to &s;et up and walk in the open air the better. Even in tho&s;e ca&s;es where they langui&s;h mo&s;t for the bed, they &s;hould be encouraged rather to lay upon, than under the bed cloaths.&mdash;Children
<PB N="22" REF="017362_0022_0FA1129704321CA8">
&s;hould be &s;tript of flannel petticoats that come in contact with their &s;kins, and even clouts &s;hould be laid a&s;ide if po&s;&s;ible without great inconve|nience, and at any rate they &s;hould be often re|moved.&mdash;Great and obvious as the advantages of cold air are in the eruptive fever, it has &s;ome|times been u&s;ed to an exce&s;s that has done mi&s;|chief.&mdash;There are few ca&s;es where a degree of cold below 40 of <HI>Farenheit's</HI> thermometer is nece&s;&s;ary in this &s;tage of the &s;mall-pox. When it has been u&s;ed below this, or where patients have been expo&s;ed to a damp atmo&s;phere &s;ome degrees above it, I have heard of inflammations of an alarming nature being produced in the throat and brea&s;t.</P>
<P>C. The bowels, more e&s;pecially of children, &s;hould be kept open with gentle laxatives. And</P>
<P>D. Cool &s;ubacid drinks &s;hould be drank plentifully until the eruption is completed.</P>
<P>Sometimes the &s;mall-pox comes on with a fever the rever&s;e of that which we have de&s;cribed. The heat is incon&s;iderable, the pul&s;e is weak, and &s;carcely quicker than ordinary, and the patient com|plains of but &s;light pains in the back and head. Here the treatment &s;hould be widely different from
<PB N="23" REF="017362_0023_0FA11297105E0870">
that which has been mentioned when the fever is of the inflammatory kind. Bleeding in this ca&s;e is hurtful, and even cool air mu&s;t be admit|ted with caution. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the phy&s;ician in this ca&s;e is to excite a gentle action in the &s;angui|ferous &s;y&s;tem, in order to produce the degree of fever nece&s;&s;ary to the eruption of the pock.&mdash;For this purpo&s;e he may recommend the u&s;e of warm drinks, and even of a warm bed with ad|vantage.&mdash;If the eruption delays beyond the third day with all the circum&s;tances of debility that have been mentioned, I have frequently ordered my patients to eat a few ounces of animal food and to drink a gla&s;s or two of wine with the mo&s;t de&s;irable &s;ucce&s;s. The effects of this indul|gence are mo&s;t obvious where the weakne&s;s of the fever and the delay of the eruption in chil|dren have made it nece&s;&s;ary to allow it to mo|thers and nur&s;es.&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;mall-pox by Inoculation &s;o &s;eldom comes on with the &s;ymptoms of a putrid fever, that little need be &s;aid of the treatment proper in &s;uch ca&s;es. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the cold regimen in the highe&s;t degree pro|mi&s;es more &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e ca&s;es than in any others.&mdash;I have repeatedly been told, that when
<PB N="24" REF="017362_0024_0FA11298104E9F20">
the &s;mall-pox appears confluent among the A|fricans, it is a common practice for mothers to rub their children all over with pepper, and plunge them immediately afterwards into a &s;pring of cold water.&mdash;This, they &s;ay, de&s;troys a great part of the pock, and di&s;po&s;es the remainder to a kind|ly &s;uppuration. From the &s;ucce&s;s that has attend|ed the u&s;e of the cold bath in putrid fevers in &s;ome parts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a di&s;&s;ertation entitled "<HI>Epidemia vernae quae Wrati&s;laviam, Anno</HI> 1737 <HI>afflixit,</HI>" publi&s;hed in the appendix to the Acta Nat. Curios. Vol. X. it appears, that wa&s;hing the body all over with cold water in putrid fevers, attended with great debility, was attended with &s;ucce&s;s at <HI>Bre&s;law</HI> in <HI>Sile&s;ia.</HI> The practice has &s;ince been adopted we are told by &s;everal of the neighbouring coun|tries. CULLEN'S FIRST LINES OF THE PRACTICE OF PHYSIC.</NOTE> of Europe mentioned in a former lecture, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe in the efficacy of the African remedy.</P>
<P>The fever generally la&s;ts three days, and the eruption continues for a &s;imilar length of time, counting the la&s;t day of the fever as the fir&s;t day of the eruption. But this remark is liable to many exceptions. We &s;ometimes ob&s;erve the eruption to begin on the fir&s;t, and often on the &s;econd day of the fever, and we &s;ometimes meet
<PB N="25" REF="017362_0025_0FA1129887FE5360">
with ca&s;es in which a &s;econd eruption comes on after the fever has abated for &s;everal days, and the fir&s;t eruption con&s;iderably advanced in its progre&s;s towards a complete &s;uppuration.&mdash;This is often occa&s;ioned by the application of exce&s;|&s;ive cold, or heat to the body, or by a &s;udden and premature u&s;e of &s;timulating drinks, or ani|mal food.</P>
<P>I come now to treat of the be&s;t method of mitigating trouble&s;ome and alarming &s;ym|ptoms.</P>
<P>The only <HI>alarming</HI> &s;ymptom is convul&s;ions to which children are &s;ubject during the time of dentition. The&s;e have been le&s;s frequent, &s;ince the liberal and judicious u&s;e of cool air in the eruptive fever than formerly. They are often relieved by putting the feet in warm water. But a more effectual and &s;peedy method of curing them is to expo&s;e our patients &s;uddenly to the open air. The colder the air the quicker relief it affords in the&s;e ca&s;es. To prevent the return of the fits, as well as to allay any di&s;agreeable and trouble&s;ome &s;tartings, a few drops of Lauda|num &s;hould be given. They generally yield in a little while to this excellent remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="017362_0026_0FA1129956E78E50">
The next &s;ymptom which demands the aid of our art is the inflammation and &s;ore on the arm. Poultices of all kinds &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, as tending to increa&s;e the inflammation and &s;ore.&mdash;In&s;tead of the&s;e, the part affected &s;hould be wa&s;h|ed three or four times a day with cold water.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Where the inflammation on the arm has been &s;o con&s;iderable, as not to yield immediately to the application of cold water, I have u&s;ed the vegeto-mineral water with advantage.&mdash;</NOTE> This application is not only agreeable to our pa|tients, but &s;oon checks the progre&s;s of the in|flammation, and di&s;po&s;es the &s;ore to heal about the time the eruption is completed. The eyes &s;hould likewi&s;e be wa&s;hed frequently with cold water to &s;ecure them from pu&s;tules and inflam|mation.&mdash;With re&s;pect to tho&s;e alarming or trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms which occur in tho&s;e ca&s;e where the pocks are numerous, or confluent, they happen &s;o &s;eldom in Inoculation that they do not come properly under our notice in this place. They are moreover fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by Docts. <HI>Boer|have, Huxham, Hillary</HI> and other practical writers.&mdash;</P>
<P>V. I come now in the la&s;t place to deliver a
<PB N="27" REF="017362_0027_0FA1129A02716590">
few directions that are nece&s;&s;ary after the erup|tion and &s;uppuration are over.</P>
<P>It is well known that eruptions of an ob|&s;tinate nature &s;ometimes follow the &s;mall-pox. The&s;e I believe, are often occa&s;ioned by a too <HI>&s;udden</HI> and &s;peedy u&s;e of animal food. To guard again&s;t the&s;e di&s;agreeable con&s;equences of Inoculation, it is of the utmo&s;t importance to en|join a cautious and <HI>gradual</HI> return to the free u&s;e of an animal diet, and at the &s;ame time it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give our patients a do&s;e or two of purging phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>Thus Gentlemen have I delivered to you a &s;hort hi&s;tory of the new method of inoculating for the &s;mall-pox. I am aware that prejudices are entertained again&s;t &s;ome parts of it by phy|&s;icians of the mo&s;t ancient name and character among us. I have witne&s;&s;ed the effects of the old and new methods of preparing the body, upon many thou&s;and patients, and I am &s;atis|fied not only from my own ob&s;ervations, but from the experience of Gentlemen upon who&s;e judgments I rely more than upon my own, that the new method is by far the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful.&mdash;Added to this, I can a&s;&s;ure my pupils, that I have never known a &s;ingle in&s;tance of a
<PB N="28" REF="017362_0028_0FA1129D326E0CA8">
patient prepared and treated in the manner I have de&s;cribed, that ever had an ab&s;ce&s;s after the &s;mall-pox, or even &s;uch an inflammation or &s;ore upon the arm as required the applica|tion of a poultice.&mdash;</P>
