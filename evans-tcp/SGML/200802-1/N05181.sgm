<HEAD>THE LIFE and CHARACTER OF Mrs. MARY LLOYD.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible a <HI>Charm</HI> in undi&s;&s;embled <HI>Ver|tue,</HI> that there are but few, who do not profe&s;s to admire its Excellence: &mdash;Something &s;o <HI>&s;hocking</HI> in the naked Deformity of <HI>Vice,</HI> that the mo&s;t corrupt Minds are a&s;hamed to own their Attachment to it. But when Men are exhorted, to regulate their Lives by the &s;acred Precepts of <HI>Religion,</HI> how apt are they to look upon it as a vain and impracticable Attempt; and complain that it offers Vio|lence to Human Nature, by laying an <HI>un|rea&s;onable Re&s;traint</HI> upon the Appetites of
<PB N="2" REF="006530_0008_10292F520EC1C178">
Fle&s;h and Blood. To remove the&s;e ground|le&s;s Prejudices, the in&s;pired Scriptures &s;et before us, the bright Cloud of antient Wit|ne&s;&s;es, who have <HI>&s;hone</HI> as <HI>Lights</HI> a dark and degenerate World; and earne&s;tly invite us to be <HI>Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promi&s;es.</HI> And perhaps, nothing affords greater Encourage|ment to &s;erious Minds, than to find that Men of <HI>like</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions, placed in the <HI>&s;ame dangerous</HI> Circum&s;tances, and &s;urrounded with <HI>equal</HI> Trials and Temptations, have, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine Grace, bravely conquered the Difficulties of the Chri&s;tian Life, and <HI>ran with Patience the Race &s;et before them.</HI> This &s;hows us, that Religion is not a bare <HI>ab&s;tracted Theory,</HI> contrived for the Entertainment of <HI>&s;peculative</HI> Minds; but is an undoubted <HI>Reality,</HI> of which many of our Fellow-Creatures have felt the tran&s;|forming Power in their Hearts; and exem|plified in an amiable and vertuous Conduct. This has the highe&s;t Tendency to encourage others, to imitate tho&s;e <HI>in&s;tructive Patterns,</HI> who in their Day were illu&s;trious <HI>Ornaments</HI> of the Church, and diffu&s;ive <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> to Mankind. Upon this Account, the <HI>Lives</HI> of <HI>eminent Saints,</HI> have always been e&s;teemed the mo&s;t <HI>valuable,</HI> Part of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
<PB N="3" REF="006530_0009_10292F55EC10E628">
Hi&s;tory. In this Way, they have <HI>&s;poke</HI> to Survivors, even when &s;leeping in the <HI>Silence of Death,</HI> and extended the Influence of their Piety, to di&s;tant Places, and thro' &s;ucceeding Ages.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>public Honour</HI> due to Per|&s;ons of di&s;hngui&s;h'd Worth: Whil&s;t they <HI>live,</HI> we cannot publi&s;h their Vertues, with|out expo&s;ing <HI>them</HI> to the dangerous Temp|tation of <HI>Pride,</HI> and <HI>our&s;elves</HI> to the Impu|tation of a &s;ervile and de&s;igning <HI>Flattery.</HI> But when they are <HI>removed</HI> from this Stage of Vanity, and rai&s;ed above the Cen&s;ure or Applau&s;e of Mortals, we may <HI>&s;afely</HI> propo&s;e their lovely Patterns, to the Attention and Imitation of Po&s;terity. And indeed, it would be an <HI>Injury</HI> to Mankind, to &s;uffer their &s;uperior Qualities, to <HI>lie buried</HI> in per|petual Oblivion; and tho&s;e Names which God has dignified by his Grace, to peri&s;h without any <HI>Mark</HI> of <HI>Di&s;tinction.</HI> When they are a&s;cended above the&s;e Regions of Guilt and Darkne&s;s, and are entered into the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly of the Church of the Fir&s;t-born,</HI> it becomes us who are &s;till con|fined to this Vale of Tears, and fighting under the Banner of the Cro&s;s, to <HI>perpetuate</HI> the Remembrance of their Vertues, and
<PB N="4" REF="006530_0010_10292F576D2C1E10">
ardently <HI>a&s;pire after</HI> that State of Purity and Perfection, to which they are advanced.</P>
<P>ALL who had the Happine&s;s of Mrs. LLOYD's Acquaintance, will be &s;o ju&s;t as to acknowledge, that in the pre&s;ent Age there have appeared, but few more excellent Examples of <HI>genuine</HI> Piety, and <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> U&s;efulne&s;s. Her <HI>Friends</HI> will be plea&s;ed, to have tho&s;e extraordinary Qualities, placed in a proper Light, which rendered her their Delight and Admiration, while <HI>living,</HI> and will embalm her Memory, now &s;he is <HI>dead. Strangers</HI> to her, may al&s;o from a Peru&s;al of the&s;e Pages, be excited to de&s;pi&s;e the <HI>Pomps</HI> and <HI>Venities</HI> of Life; which are unworthy the Pur&s;uit of a rational Creature; and to &s;eek after tho&s;e <HI>Endowments,</HI> which add a <HI>real Dignity</HI> to Human Nature, and pre|pare for a &s;uperior State of Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THESE Con&s;iderations have determined me, tho' in all re&s;pects unequal to the Ta&s;k, to give &s;ome Account of her <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Character.</HI> The Reader mu&s;t not ex|pect a pompous Detail of <HI>Facts,</HI> diver&s;ified with a Variety of entertaining <HI>Incidents.</HI> &mdash; She maintained one uniform Tenor of <HI>Devo|tion</HI> to the <HI>Supreme Being,</HI> and diligent
<PB N="5" REF="006530_0011_10292F5AAB9A3F28">
Attendance to the <HI>Duties</HI> of <HI>Common Life.</HI> She never affected a <HI>public Appearance</HI> be|yond the Decency of her Station; not interfered with Affairs, foreign to her Sex. This will nece&s;&s;arily cut &s;hort the <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> Part of the following Performance. I &s;hall principally enlarge upon her <HI>Character,</HI> which cannot, without the extreme&s;t Inju&s;tice, be confined in a very narrow Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>MRS. LLOYD was born at BOSTON, in NEW-ENGLAND. <HI>May</HI> 1681, of a good Family; being the only Child of Mr. <HI>John Clarke</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Mary Atwater.</HI> Her <HI>Father,</HI> a Commander of a Ve&s;&s;el, was, in her In|fancy, carried into Captivity by the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who to this Day infe&s;t the <HI>Me|diteranean</HI> Sea, and are the <HI>common Enemies</HI> of the trading Nations of <HI>Europe.</HI> The&s;e Barbarians generally u&s;e tho&s;e who are &s;o unfortunate as to fall into their Hands, with the greate&s;t <HI>Cruelty:</HI> But Capt. <HI>Clarke</HI> being a Gentleman of Ingenuity and Addre&s;s, met with uncommon <HI>Civility,</HI> and was exempted from that <HI>&s;ervile Drudgery</HI> to which mo&s;t of their Pri&s;oners are condemned. Here he was &s;eized with that fatal Di&s;temper, the <HI>Small|Pox,</HI> of which he died in a few Days. &mdash; Her <HI>Mother</HI> was a Woman of &s;uperior Piety
<PB N="6" REF="006530_0012_10292F5E6C221880">
and, good Sen&s;e, and lived to the Age of Sixty three, in Honour and U&s;efulne&s;s. She was endued, with great Prudence; managed her hou&s;hold Affairs with the ju&s;te&s;t Eco|nomy, and &s;upported the Afflictions of Life with Patience and Re&s;ignation. She was familiar with the Thoughts of Death, even in her highe&s;t Health, and made it her <HI>prin|cipal Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> to prepare for that important Event. When &s;he felt its fir&s;t Approaches, &s;he received it not as the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Terrors,</HI> but as a <HI>Me&s;&s;enger</HI> of <HI>Joy</HI> &mdash;the Angel of her Deliverance. <Q>The Ble&s;&s;ed Day, (&s;ays &s;he) is come, which I have been &s;o long ex|pecting and preparing for.</Q> &mdash; And in a few Hours expired in the greate&s;t Tranquility and Peace.</P>
<P>THIS Gentlewoman, after Capt, <HI>Clarke</HI>'s early Departure, continued &s;everal Years a di&s;con&s;olate Widow. Afterwards &s;he married Mr. <HI>John Coney</HI>; who always treated Mrs. <HI>Lloyd</HI> with the Affection and Tenderne&s;s of a <HI>Father.</HI> Under his Roof, &s;he enjoyed all the Opportunities &s;he could de&s;ire, to im|prove in Knowledge and Vertue; and to obtain tho&s;e <HI>other Qualifications,</HI> which were &s;uitable to her Sex and Character. She had <HI>equal</HI> Advantages with his <HI>own</HI> Children:
<PB N="7" REF="006530_0013_10292F6105398E10">
I have often heard her &s;ay, that if at any Time a <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> was made, it was gene|rally in her Favour. She always &s;poke of this <HI>uncommon Genero&s;ity,</HI> with the greate&s;t Thankfulne&s;s, and paid this worthy Gentle|man, while he <HI>lived,</HI> all the Offices of <HI>Filial|Piety.</HI> After his <HI>Death,</HI> &s;he never mentioned his Name, without &s;ome <HI>&s;ingular</HI> Mark of Gratitude and Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>IN this agreeable Situation, Mrs. <HI>Lloyd</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the Days of her Youth; and by her vertuous, obliging Behaviour, recommended her&s;elf to the good Opinion of all who knew her. The <HI>Royal Preacher</HI> tells us, that <HI>Childhood and Youth are Vanity</HI>; and <HI>melan|cholly Ob&s;ervation</HI> &s;hows, that this <HI>beautiful</HI> Sea&s;on of Life is generally lavi&s;hed away in <HI>Amu&s;ements,</HI> if not &s;pent in an entire <HI>Forget|fulne&s;s</HI> of God, and the great End of our Being. But perhaps, never was any Per&s;on freer from the <HI>common Follies</HI> incident to Youth, than Mrs. <HI>Lloyd.</HI> The Principles of the divine Life, &s;eemed to di&s;play them|&s;elves with the <HI>fir&s;t Dawning</HI> of Rea&s;on. She often &s;aid, that &s;he never knew the Time, when &s;he began to be &s;erious. From her very <HI>Infancy,</HI> &s;he di&s;covered a deep Abhorrence of every Vice, and an earne&s;t Solicitude to
<PB N="8" REF="006530_0014_10292F6286E77C90">
devote her&s;elf to the Service of her Maker. From a <HI>Child,</HI> &s;he read the <HI>Scriptures</HI> with unu&s;ual Delight,&mdash; ob&s;erved her &s;tated Hours of <HI>Retirement,</HI>&mdash; and took Plea&s;ure to <HI>a&s;&s;o|ciate</HI> her&s;elf with Per&s;ons of Eminence in Religion.</P>
<P>BUT, not with &s;tanding the Happine&s;s of an unblemi&s;hed Youth; She, in the early Years of Life, fell under a deep Conviction of her Guilt and Mi&s;ery; and was, for many Months, anxiou&s;ly &s;olicitous for her immor|tal Welfare. She found no <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> but at the Foot&s;tool of &s;overeign and unmerited Grace; &mdash; no <HI>Safety,</HI> but in a fiducial Application, to the Merits and Mediation of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> All her Days, &s;he had the highe&s;t Reli&s;h for tho&s;e Doctrines, which have the mo&s;t appo|&s;ite Tendency to <HI>humble</HI> the <HI>Pride</HI> of human Nature,&mdash;<HI>exalt</HI> the Riches of divine <HI>Grace,</HI>&mdash;and a&s;cribe the entire Glory of Salvation to a crucified Redeemer.</P>
<P>THE Beauty, of her Per&s;on,&mdash;the Spright|line&s;s of her Wit, &mdash; the Charms of her Conver&s;ation, but above all, the <HI>unfeigned Piety</HI> which crowned her other Accompli&s;h|ments, &s;oon procured her many Admirers. She had &s;everal advantageous Offers, of a
<PB N="9" REF="006530_0015_10292F64F8EC0198">
Settlement in the <HI>married</HI> Life. She fixed her Choice upon the Revd. Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Pemberton,</HI> Pa&s;tor of a flour&s;hing <HI>Church</HI> in BOSTON; and one of the mo&s;t celebrated Preachers of his Age. To this Gentleman &s;he was married in the Year 1701. They lived together with mutual Delight and Sa|tisfaction, till the Year 1717; when their Marriage Relation was di&s;&s;olved, by the Death of Mr. <HI>Pemberton.</HI> They had &s;even Children: <HI>Three</HI> of which died in their In|fancy; <HI>Four,</HI> thro' the good Providence of God, yet &s;urvive. May we be <HI>Heirs</HI> of that Grace which &s;o eminently re&s;ided in our <HI>departed Parents,</HI> and follow them in their exemplary Cour&s;e of Vertue!&mdash;Then, we &s;hall &s;hortly <HI>meet</HI> them again, in that ble&s;&s;ed World, where will be no more Sorrow, Seperation, or Death!</P>
<P>THE indulgent Reader will allow me to <HI>&s;hed</HI> a few <HI>Tears</HI> over the Grave of &s;o ex|cellent a Father; who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in&s;truction and Ex|ample I lo&s;t, before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an Opportunity, to know their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and Advantage. I &s;hall not attempt his <HI>Character</HI>:&mdash;I am happily prevented by the <HI>Sermons</HI> occa&s;ioned by his Death, preached by the Revd. Drs. <HI>Colman</HI> and <HI>Sewall.</HI> His own printed Di&s;|cour&s;es
<PB N="10" REF="006530_0016_10292F687A79AA60">
&s;how, he had all the Qualifications requi&s;ite to con&s;titute a great and a good Man. The <HI>ma&s;terly Rea&s;oner,</HI>&mdash;the <HI>judicious Divine,</HI>&mdash;the <HI>&s;ervant Preacher,</HI>&mdash;the <HI>accom|pli&s;hed Orator,</HI> appear in almo&s;t every Page of his Writings. He &s;pent his Life in the mo&s;t a&s;&s;idous Labours, to enlarge and &s;up|port the Kingdom of his Ma&s;ter. He died in the full A&s;&s;urance of Faith, in <HI>triumphant</HI> Views of eternal Felicity. This was the Language of his <HI>faultring</HI> Tongue, in his expiring Moments, <Q>I thank God, who hath given me a good Hope thro' Chri&s;t. Notwith&s;tanding my many Infirmities, both in public and private; thro' his Grace I have been enabled to be &s;incere and upright before him. And I can now look for an Hou&s;e not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens, when this Hou&s;e of my earthly Tabernacle is di&s;&s;olved. And this Hope is built only on the Merits of Chri&s;t, who hath &s;uffered &s;o much for me; who died, and is ri&s;er again, and lives for ever, to make Interce&s;&s;ion for me. And upon this Foundation is built, my Hope for my &s;elf, my Family, my Church, and the whole I&s;rael of God: And I thank God, who hath enabled me, in a dying Hour, to expre&s;s this my Hope.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006530_0017_10292F6AF734ACD8">THIS Lo&s;s mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be very heavy to <HI>Her,</HI> who for many Years had been united with him, in the mo&s;t <HI>delightful</HI> Society, and <HI>re&s;in'd</HI> Friend&s;hip. Her tender and affecti|onate Nature, was ready to &s;ink under the &s;evere Trial. But, &s;he was enabled to glo|rify God, in the <HI>Height</HI> of her Affliction; and exhibit to all around, an in&s;tructive <HI>Example</HI> of Chri&s;tian Patience, and profound Submi&s;&s;ion, to the Will of her heavenly Father.</P>
<P>IN her Widowhood, as &s;oon as her Cir|cum&s;tances would permit, &s;he entered upon a <HI>retired</HI> Scene of Life; that &s;he might with greater Freedom, conver&s;e with Heaven, and in&s;pect the Education of her <HI>Children</HI>; who were now left under her immediate Direction. Perhaps, none ever manife&s;ted a more &s;olicitous Concern for the Felicity of their <HI>Offspring,</HI> than Mrs. <HI>Lloyd</HI>; or, more ince&s;&s;antly <HI>travelled in Birth, that Chri&s;t might be formed in them.</HI> She lodged many an ardent <HI>Petition</HI> in the Court of Heaven, on their Behalf; and daily recommended them to the Grace of our Almighty Saviour. She reque&s;ted nothing for them, with a <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> Importunity, but a Union to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as their <HI>living Head</HI>; and an Admi&s;&s;ion into
<PB N="12" REF="006530_0018_10292F6C79FF4658">
the Number of his redeemed People. She rejoiced, to &s;ee them increa&s;e in Knowledge,&mdash;appear with a ju&s;t <HI>Decorum,</HI> upon the Stage of Life,&mdash;and comfortably &s;ettled in the World. But &s;he knew, the&s;e were <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>precarious</HI> Advantages, in&s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the <HI>boundle&s;s Appetites</HI> of an intelligent and immortal Spirit. To obtain for Her&s;elf, and Po&s;terity, the Favour of an <HI>unchangeable</HI> GOD, and an Intre&s;t in that <HI>everla&s;ting Covenant, in all Things well ordered and &s;ure,</HI> was the Height of her Ambition. If this was &s;ecured, &s;he was per&s;waded they would be happy in <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> and <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI>&mdash;in <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Health,</HI>&mdash;in <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI> Therefore, &s;he in&s;tilled into their tender Minds, <HI>the good Knowledge of the Lord</HI>: And as they grew up to Years of Di&s;cretion, by the mo&s;t gentle and <HI>attractive</HI> Methods of Per&s;wa&s;ion, &s;trove to engage them to dedicate their Youth, to the Service of God; and &s;edulou&s;ly to avoid tho&s;e <HI>Irregularities,</HI> by which the <HI>Morning</HI> of Life, is &s;o frequently <HI>darkned</HI> and defiled.</P>
<P>SHE continued a Widow &s;everal Years; employing her Time, in Exerci&s;es of <HI>Devo|tion</HI>&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ary Cares, of her <HI>Family,</HI>&mdash;and the Offices of <HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI> Afterwards, &s;he married <HI>Johns Campbell,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> a Gentleman.

of good Character, and in plentiful Cir|cum&s;tances: Who proved an <HI>affectionate</HI> Hu&s;band to <HI>Her,</HI> and an <HI>indulgent</HI> Father to her <HI>Children.</HI> He lived but a few Years after this Marriage; and died in a peaceful and honourable old Age.</P>
<P>AFTER a &s;uitable Interval, &s;he married <HI>Henry Lloyd,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> of the <HI>Manor</HI> of <HI>Queen's</HI><HI>Village,</HI> in the Province of NEW-YORK.

<P>MEDITATION I.</P>
<P><HI>Upon the</HI> TRUTH <HI>of the</HI> CHRISTIAN RELIGION; <HI>and, an Enquiry into the State of my own Soul.</HI></P>
<P>_O MY ever glorious and gracious God, and heavenly Father in Je&s;us Chri&s;t! I read in the &s;acred Oracles of Truth, that Thou did&s;t <HI>&s;o love the World, as to give thine only begotten Son, that who|&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life</HI>;&mdash;and that <HI>this Life is in thy Son</HI>&mdash;Thou ha&s;t al&s;o borne Te&s;timony, that JESUS <HI>is</HI> thy <HI>beloved Son, in whom</HI> thou

art <HI>well plea&s;ed</HI>;&mdash;that tho&s;e who <HI>believe thy Te&s;timony have &s;et to their Seal, that God is true;&mdash;but they that believe not, have made God a Liar.</HI> I therefore importunately pray, That thou woulde&s;t be&s;tow on me, <HI>that Faith by which the Ju&s;t do live</HI>; and all tho&s;e divine and heavenly Qualifications, which are the certain <HI>Con&s;equence,</HI> and be&s;t <HI>Evidence,</HI> of my Union to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; in <HI>whom all the Promi&s;es are Yea and Amen.</HI></P>
<P>All this, and what&s;oever el&s;e, is requi&s;ite to my pre&s;ent and future Happine&s;s, mu&s;t proceed from thee, <HI>who art the Author and Fini&s;her of our Faith.</HI>&mdash;For thou ha&s;t decla|red, <HI>That none can come to the Son, but tho&s;e whom the Father draws: And none can know the Father, but tho&s;e to whom the Son doth reveal him.</HI> I de&s;ire therefore, in the Name and Strength, of my glorious and exalted Advocate and Redeemer, humbly to plead with Faith and Fervency, for the efficacious and all-conquering Drawings of thy holy Holy Spirit; that I may indeed obtain a &s;aving Knowledge, <HI>of the thee, the living and true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>O MY GOD! wilt thou be graciou&s;ly plea|&s;ed for Chri&s;t's Sake, <HI>to &s;end forth thy Light

and thy Truth, to lead me into all Truth,</HI> and enable me, at this Time, to make a faithful and &s;incere Enquiry, whether my Faith be true and &s;aving? whether indeed <HI>Chri&s;t is formed in me</HI>? May I be enable now, and at all Times, &s;o to <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>practice,</HI> as my tend mo&s;t for thy Glory and the Salvation of my own Soul. May I never think, &s;peak, or write, any Thing, but what I receive from thee, and is agreeable to thy holy Will.</P>
<P>I DESIRE to have my whole Dependance upon thy glorious Maje&s;ty, to enable me always to &s;ee divine Truths in a proper Light, and <HI>to work within me the whole good Plea&s;ure of thy Grace, and the Work of Faith with Power.</HI> All this, and whatever el&s;e is needful for me and mine, and the whole I&s;rael of God, I humbly beg for Chri&s;t's Sake:&mdash;To whom, with thy glorious Maje&s;ty, and the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of Grace, the Comforter, be rendered, the Kingdom, Power, Glory and Thank&s;|giving, now and evermore, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>AND now having look'd up to Heaven, for divine Illumination; I will &s;et about this important Enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI> What is the <HI>Fou|dation</HI> of my Faith?&mdash;whether I have indeed Felt the <HI>transforming</HI> Power of this Faith, and

con&s;equently whether I am by divine Grace; <HI>united</HI> unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Second <HI>Adam</HI>; by Virtue of which Union alone, I can live &s;piritually and eternally. An <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> Faith, which is only conveyed to me by my Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding, I know is not &s;ufficient; <HI>for the Devils believe and tremble,</HI>&mdash;My En|quiry then mu&s;t be, what is a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>&s;aving</HI> Faith; and whether I have been made the happy Subject of this Faith.

I will therefore fir&s;t examine, how far my <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> will a&s;&s;i&s;t me in this important Enquiry.</P>
<P>EVERY one <HI>that cometh unto God, mu&s;t be|lieve, that be is, and that be is the Rewarder of tho&s;e that diligently &s;eek him.</HI> That there is a God, a Supreme Being, the great Creator, and Lord Proprietor of all Things, not only the Light of Nature, and the Dictates of Rea&s;on, but my very <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> inform me.

But that the <HI>Book,</HI> in Which I find all the&s;e glorious Doctrines &s;o plainly and &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted, is a <HI>Revelation</HI> from Heaven, my <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> very much a&s;&s;i&s;ts me in the Belief of: So that the great Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, with much Ju&s;tice and Propriety, ranks Unbe|lievers with <HI>unrea&s;onable Men.</HI> For altho' the &s;ublime Mi&s;teries of the Go&s;pel, are in them&s;elves &s;o infinitely beyond the <HI>Ken</HI> of human Rea&s;on; nor could ever be di&s;covered by the dim Light of Nature; yet they are &s;o plainly and convincingly <HI>conveyed</HI> to us in the &s;acred <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and attended with &s;o <HI>&s;trong</HI> an Evidence of their divine Authority, as is &s;ufficient to obtain the Belief of every rea&s;on|nable and <HI>unprejudiced</HI> Per&s;on.</P>
<P>IN this ble&s;&s;ed Book I find an Account of the <HI>Creation,</HI> which not only may <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> but my very <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> inform me is true.

GOD.&mdash;But <HI>how,</HI> or in <HI>what Manner,</HI> this Promi&s;e was to be accompli&s;h'd, neither Men nor Angels dare &s;o much as have gue&s;s'd,&mdash;without <HI>divine Revelation.</HI> But the &s;acred Oracles of Truth, inform me, <HI>that God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that all who believe in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have Life ever|la&s;ting.</HI>&mdash;This I believe upon the Authority of the Word of God. That JESUS CHRIST is this invaluable Gift, I have the Te&s;timony of the great God him&s;elf, who by an audible Voice from Heaven, declar'd <HI>him, his beloved Son, in whom he is well pleas'd.</HI>&mdash;Upon this <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Evidence I may &s;afely venture my ALL, for Time and Eternity. That <HI>this Voice</HI> was indeed from <HI>the excellent Glory,</HI> and no <HI>Impo&s;ition</HI> upon the Sen&s;es of tho&s;e that heard, it, appears in that the glorious God was pleas'd, to <HI>confirm</HI> the Mi&s;&s;on of Chri&s;t, by the highe&s;t Evidence that can be,&mdash;his <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> from the Dead; which could be effected by no Power &s;hort of the <HI>Almighty</HI> Creator of all Things.</P>
<P>THIS, I think, is the &s;tronge&s;t Demon|&s;tration of the <HI>Truth</HI> of all that Chri&s;t deli|livered: For it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Fountain of all po&s;&s;ible Perfection would <HI>au|thori&s;e</HI>

<P>THUS the great and glorious God, is pleas'd to deal with us as <HI>rea&s;onable Creatures</HI>; and by Means and In&s;truments, conveys to us &s;piritual Truth: But after all, the &s;ublime My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel, cannot be &s;avingly comprehended, in this Way alone: The Line of Rea&s;on is too &s;hort, to teach tho&s;e unfa|thomable Depths, <HI>which Angels them&s;elves de|&s;ire to look into.</HI> It is the mighty Power of God which produces in us that Faith, <HI>which is unto Salvation.</HI></P>

<PB N="114" REF="006530_0120_1029307FF31E6148">
offended thee, my heavenly Father; and in all Things have fallen &s;hort of my Duty to God and my Fellow-Creatures;&mdash;All my Faults have been attended with this great Aggravation, that they were a Violation of my &s;olemn Vows and Covenant Engagements.</P>
<P>How ju&s;t and equitable is the Apo&s;tle's Exhortation, <HI>I be&s;eech you therefore, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that you pre&s;ent your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea&s;onable Service.</HI> How criminal and &s;acrilegious is every Deviation from my Covenant Vows; every Departure from my rightful Lord and Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I BLESS thy glorious Maje&s;ty, that thou ha&s;t not puni&s;hed me according to my Iniqui|ties, nor taken away from me thy forfeited Ble&s;&s;ings. But that thou art &s;till continuing to me the Strivings of thy Holy Spirit, and ha&s;t &s;o far overcome the natural Depravity of my Heart, that Sin is my greate&s;t Aver&s;ion; thy Service my highe&s;t Delight: That my Hopes and Fears, De&s;ires and Delights, my &s;upreme Choice and Affection, centers in the living and unchangeable God. O! that it were more perfectly &s;o!&mdash;If thou art my Por|tion, I &s;hall certainly be happy, tho' de&s;titute of every Thing el&s;e. If thou with-holde&s;t
<PB N="115" REF="006530_0121_102930817AF17270">
thy Favour, I mu&s;t be inexpre&s;&s;ibly mi&s;erable, tho' plac'd in the Bo&s;om of Heaven it&s;elf.</P>
<P>UNDER a deep Conviction of the&s;e Things, I de&s;ire again to renew, the Dedication of my &s;elf unto thee. But what have I now to offer, but what is thine already, by the mo&s;t indi&s;|putable Title, and the &s;tronge&s;t Obligations. I would give up my Heart unto thee, O my God! it being the be&s;t Offering I have to make; humbly praying. That thou woulde&s;t be plea&s;ed to take it, into thine own Hand, and form it for thy &s;elf. Kindle within it, &s;uch a Flame of divine Love, as &s;hall de&s;troy every other Affection, which &s;tands in Com|petition with thee. To thee therefore, O almighty Sovereign, and heavenly Father! To thee, O compa&s;&s;ionate Advocate and Re|deemer! To thee, O eternal Guide and Com|forter of thy Church, do I dedicate my &s;elf and my Children, in an EVERLASTING CO|VENANT <HI>never to be broken.</HI> Re&s;olving to wait at the Foot&s;tool of Free Grace, for tho&s;e divine Communications, which are nece&s;&s;ary to enable me to live more entirely to thy Glory; and finally, to make <HI>me meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> I de&s;ire to have my entire Dependance upon my dear Redeemer;&mdash;his Strength for the Perfor|mance;
<PB N="116" REF="006530_0122_1029308611E9FFA0">
his Merit for the Acceptance of the&s;e my <HI>Covenant Engagements.</HI></P>
<P>IF there has been any Thing in the Tran&s;|actions of this Day, that is the Breathing of thy holy Spirit, be plea&s;ed to hear, an&s;wer and accept it; and every Thing of my own, pity and pardon. O my gracious God! <HI>hear my</HI> Cry, <HI>attend to the Voice of my Reque&s;ts,</HI> and do for me, for mine, and the <HI>the whole I&s;rael of God,</HI> according to thy Covenant Faithful|ne&s;s, and the Boundle&s;s Riches of thy Grace, in JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD.</P>
<P>To whom, with thy glorious Maje&s;ty, and eternal Spirit, be a&s;cribed, as is mo&s;t due, all Honour, Adoration and Prai&s;e, now and for ever more, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<Q><LG>
<L>It grieves me, Lord, it grieves me &s;ore,</L>
<L>That I have liv'd to thee no more;</L>
<L>And wa&s;ted half my Days:</L>
<L>My inward Powers &s;hould burn and flame</L>
<L>With Zeal and Pa&s;&s;ion for thy Name;</L>
<L>I would not &s;peak, but for my God, not</L>
<L>move but to his Prai&s;e.</L>
