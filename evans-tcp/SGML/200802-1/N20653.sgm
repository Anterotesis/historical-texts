<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>HAVE long la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ted, that amongst all the numerous volumes written for the amu&s;e|ment of children, few that I have ever yet &s;een have been well adapted to the puerile compre|hen&s;ions of Infants of Four or Five Years of Age: they generally are filled with incidents totally unintere&s;ting to them; &s;uch as gentlemen and ladies meeting with great happine&s;s in the nuptial &s;tate, and arriving at great wealth and riches through their &s;uperior wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s. In the opinion of the author, &s;uch like
<PB N="viii" REF="027120_0004_0FD34B86D1090DB0">
hi&s;tories, &s;o far from being beneficial to children, are either quite beyond their under&s;tanding, and therefore capable of affording no entertainment to them; or el&s;e, tend only to in&s;pire their ten|der minds with Pride, Ambition, Vanity, and every pa&s;&s;ion di&s;graceful to human nature.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The following little book was written with a view to amu&s;e and in&s;truct one particular family, in who&s;e welfare the author is nearly concerned; but if it &s;hould be di&s;tributed into the hands of other children, they may, perhaps, be equally entertained with reading the hi&s;to|ries of &s;o many little boys and girls; who, by boys and girls, will always be thought the mo&s;t important part of the &s;pecies.</HI></P>

Her Mamma called to <HI>Mary,</HI> Do not do &s;o, <HI>Mary!</HI> do not do &s;o! you will break it, and if you do I &s;hall be very angry with you!

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of Mi&s;s POLLY MEEKLY.</HEAD>
<P>MISS <HI>Polly Meekly</HI> was as good a girl as Ma&s;ter <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> was a boy, and always did as &s;he was bidden the moment

&s;he was &s;poken to. If any body called her, &s;he went di|rectly, and did not trouble them to a&s;k her more than

once to go. And if any body &s;aid, How do you do, my dear? How does your Mamma do? She an&s;wered at once like a woman, and &s;aid, <HI>Very well, I thank you, Madam!</HI> &s;o plain, that every body could hear her. Some little girls, when they are &s;poken to, an&s;wer &s;o low that they cannot be un|der&s;tood; and if you de&s;ire them to &s;ing you a &s;ong, they only put up their &s;houlders,

and hang down their heads, and look &s;illy, Mi&s;s <HI>Polly</HI> be|haved much better indeed; and if &s;he was at any time a&s;ked to &s;ing, began directly, and &s;aid,
<Q><L>I'm &s;ure I'll &s;ing with all my heart,</L>
<L>If me you like to hear;</L>
<L>But for the real &s;inger's part,</L>
<L>It will be bad I fear.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Then to your goodne&s;s tru&s;t I will,</L>

<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Polly</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ing a great many more &s;ongs, but I have forgotten all the re&s;t; though I never &s;hall forget how clean &s;he u&s;ed to rub her &s;hoes when &s;he came in doors; and how &s;he folded up her cloak and gloves, and put them away her&s;elf; for &s;he never made a

them all together; for her Mamma was &s;o kind as to let her have a box to keep all her trea&s;ures in. And &s;he took great plea&s;ure in making dolls' clothes for her little &s;i&s;ters, who were not old enough to work for them|&s;elves. She had a little dog that &s;he was very fond of, and fed every day when &s;he had her breakfa&s;t; and &s;he took great care of it, and never

The dog's name was <HI>Cato.</HI> It was a droll dog, and had a

black face, and a white back, and black feet. Mi&s;s <HI>Polly</HI> took great pains to learn to read well; and &s;he read bet|ter than any little girl I ever knew. She never fretted and cried; but was always good-humoured; and at dinner &s;he never a&s;ked and teazed for any thing, but ate what was given to her without wanting any thing el&s;e; and never grea&s;ed her fingers, but u&s;ed
