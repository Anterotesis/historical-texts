<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN making &s;elections for the following work, a preference has been given to the productions of American ge|nius. The Compiler, however, has not been wholly confined to America; but has extracted from approved writers of dif|ferent ages and countries. Convinced of the impropriety of in&s;tilling fal&s;e notions into the minds of children, he has not given place to romantic fiction. Although moral e&s;&s;ays have not been neglected; yet plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting &s;tories, exem|plifying moral virtues, were judged be&s;t calculated to engage the attention and improve the heart. Tales of love have not gained admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Compiler pledges him&s;elf, that, while this book contains nothing offen&s;ive to the mo&s;t rigid morali&s;t, neither a <HI>word</HI> nor <HI>&s;entiment</HI> &s;hall be &s;ound, which would "rai&s;e a blu&s;h on the cheek of mode&s;ty."</P>
<P>In the arrangement of pieces, the u&s;ual order has not been ob&s;erved. But, with de&s;ign to render it more plea&s;ing to chil|dren, dialogues, orations, hi&s;torical anecdotes, &amp;c. with the different kinds of reading in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, are variou&s;ly inter&s;per&s;ed through the whole work.</P>
<P>For the conveniency of large cla&s;&s;es, the &s;everal pieces are divided into paragraphs of a moderate length; the utility of which, tho&s;e conver&s;ant in the in&s;truction of youth will readily di&s;cover. In&s;tructors are a&s;&s;ured, that the inconveniency ari|&s;ing from the frequent alterations in the different editions of &s;chool-books will never be experienced in this.</P>
<P>The Compiler is far from wi&s;hing to e&s;tabli&s;h the merits of this, by making objections to other performances. Improve|ment has been his object. How far he has &s;ucceeded, a can|did public will decide.</P>

<HEAD>GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR READING AND SPEAKING. EXTRACTED FROM BLAIR'S LECTURES.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t object of a reader or &s;peaker, is, to be clearly under&s;tood by his hearers. In order for this, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould pronounce his words di&s;tinct|ly, and deliberately; that he &s;hould carefully avoid the two extremes of uttering either too fa&s;t, or too &s;low; and that his tone of voice &s;hould be perfectly natural.</P>
<P N="2">2. A reader or &s;peaker &s;hould endeavor to acquire a perfect command of his voice; &s;o as neither to &s;tun his hearers by pitching it upon too high a key; nor tire their patience by obliging them to li&s;ten to &s;ounds which are &s;carcely audible. It is not the loude&s;t &s;peaker, who is al|ways the be&s;t under&s;tood; but he who pronounces upon that key which fills the &s;pace occupied by the audience. That pitch of voice, which is u&s;ed in ordinary conver&s;a|tion, is u&s;ually the be&s;t for a public &s;peaker.</P>
<P N="3">3. Early attention ought to be paid to the pau&s;es; but the rules for the&s;e are &s;o indefinite and arbitrary, and &s;o difficult to be comprehended, that long experience is ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to acquire a perfect knowledge of their u&s;e. With regard to the length of the &s;everal pau&s;es, no preci&s;e rules can be given. This, together with the variety of tones which accompany them, depends much upon the nature of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="4">4. Perhaps nothing is of more importance to a reader or &s;peaker, than a proper attention to accent, empha&s;is, and cadence. Every word in our language, of more than one &s;yllable, has, at lea&s;t, one accented &s;yllable. This &s;yl|lable ought to be rightly known, and the word &s;hould be pronounced by the reader or &s;peaker in the &s;ame manner as he would pronounce it in ordinary conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="6" REF="026674_0006_0FD1555501DBFB90">5. By empha&s;is we di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e words in a &s;entence which we e&s;teem the mo&s;t important, by laying a greater &s;tre&s;s of voice upon them than we do upon the others. And it is &s;urpri&s;ing to ob&s;erve how the &s;en&s;e of a phra&s;e may be altered by varying the empha&s;is. The following example will &s;erve as an illu&s;tration.</P>
<P N="6">6. This &s;hort que&s;tion, "Will you ride to town to|day&punc;' may be under&s;tood in four different ways, and, con&s;equently, may receive four different an&s;wers, accord|ing to the placing of the empha&s;is.</P>
<P N="7">7. If it be pronounced thus; Will <HI>you</HI> ride to town to|day? the an&s;wer may properly be, no; I &s;hall &s;end my &s;on. If thus; Will you <HI>ride</HI> to town to-day? An&s;wer, no; I intend to walk. Will you ride to <HI>town</HI> to-day? No; I &s;hall ride into the country. Will you ride to town <HI>to-day?</HI> No; but I &s;hall to-morrow.</P>
<P N="8">8. This &s;hows how nece&s;&s;ary it is that a reader or &s;peaker &s;hould know where to place his empha&s;is. And the only rule for this is, that he &s;tudy to attain a ju&s;t con|ception of the force and &s;pirit of the &s;entiments which he delivers. There is as great a difference between one who lays his empha&s;is properly, and one who pays no regard to it, or places it wrong, as there is between one who plays on an in&s;trument with a ma&s;terly hand, and the mo&s;t bungling performer.</P>
<P N="9">9. Cadence is the rever&s;e of empha&s;is. It is a depre&s;|&s;ion or lowering of the voice; and commonly falls upon the la&s;t &s;yllable in a &s;entence. It is varied, however, accord|ing to the &s;en&s;e. When a que&s;tion is a&s;ked, it &s;eldom falls upon the la&s;t word; and many &s;entences require no cadence at all.</P>
<P N="10">10. In addition to what has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en &s;aid, it is of great im|portance to attend particularly to tones and ge&s;tures. To almo&s;t every &s;entiment we utter, more e&s;pecially, to every &s;trong emotion, nature has adapted &s;ome peculiar tone of voice. And we may ob&s;erve, that every man, when he is much in earne&s;t in common di&s;cour&s;e, when he is &s;peaking on &s;ome &s;ubject which intere&s;ts him nearly, has an eloquent or per&s;ua&s;ive tone and manner.</P>
<P N="11">11. If one were to tell another that he was very angry, or very much grieved, in a tone which did not &s;uit &s;uch emo|tions,
<PB N="7" REF="026674_0007_0FD155565F289000">
in&s;tead of being believed, he would be laughed at. The be&s;t direction which can be given, is, to copy the prop|er tones for expre&s;&s;ing every &s;entiment from tho&s;e which nature dictates to us in conver&s;ation with others.</P>
<P N="12">12. With re&s;pect to ge&s;ture, the few following hints may be of &s;ome &s;ervice. When &s;peaking in public, one &s;hould endeavor to pre&s;erve as much dignity as po&s;&s;ible in the whole attitude of the body. An erect po&s;ture is generally to be cho&s;en; &s;tanding firm &s;o as to have the fulle&s;t command of all his motions. Any inclination which is u&s;ed, &s;hould be forwards towards the hearers, which is a natural expre&s;&s;ion of earne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P N="13">13. As for the countenance, the chief rule is, that it &s;hould corre&s;pond with the nature of the di&s;cour&s;e; and when no particular emotion is expre&s;&s;ed, a &s;erious and manly look is always the be&s;t. The eyes &s;hould never be fixed clo&s;e on any one object, but move ea&s;ily round upon the whole audience.</P>
<P N="14">14. In the motions made with the hands, con&s;i&s;ts the chief part of ge&s;ture in &s;peaking. The right hand &s;hould be u&s;ed more frequently than the left. Warm emotions demand the motion of both hands corre&s;ponding together. All the ge&s;tures &s;hould be free and ea&s;y. Perpendicular movements with the hands, that is, in a &s;traight line up and down, are &s;eldom good. Oblique motions are, in general, the mo&s;t graceful.</P>
<P N="15">15. Motions made with the hands &s;hould proceed rather from the &s;houlders than from the elbows; for they appear much more ea&s;y. Too &s;udden and nimble motions &s;hould be avoided. Earne&s;tne&s;s can be fully expre&s;&s;ed without them. Above all things, a &s;peaker &s;hould guard again&s;t affectation, which is always di&s;gu&s;tful.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SELECT SENTENCES.</HEAD>
<P>TIME is more valuable to young people than to any others. They &s;hould not lo&s;e an hour in forming their ta&s;te, their manners, and their minds; for whatever they are, to a certain degree, at eighteen, they will be more or le&s;s &s;o all the re&s;t of their lives.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="026674_0008_0FD155580F7E2408">2. Nothing can be of greater &s;ervice to a young man who has any degree of under&s;tanding, than an intimate con|ver&s;ation with one of riper years, who is not only able to advi&s;e, but who knows the manner of advi&s;ing. By this mean, youth can enjoy the benefit of the experience of age; and that, at a time of life when &s;uch experience will be of more &s;ervice to a man&punc; than when he has lived long enough to acquire it of him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. The kindne&s;&s;es which mo&s;t men receive from others, are like traces drawn in the &s;and. The breath of every pa&s;&s;ion &s;weeps them away, and they are remembered no more. But injuries are like in&s;criptions on monuments of bra&s;s or pillars of marble, which endure, unimpaired, the revolutions of time.</P>
<P N="4">4. View the groves in autumn, and ob&s;erve the con|&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of falling leaves; in like manner the gene|rations of men &s;ilently drop from the &s;tage of life, and are blended with the du&s;t from whence they &s;prang.</P>
<P N="5">5. Perfect happine&s;s is not the growth of a terre&s;trial &s;oil; it buds in the gardens of the virtuous on earth, but blooms with unfading verdure only in the cele&s;tial regions.</P>
<P N="6">6. He who would pa&s;s the latter part of his life with honor and decency mu&s;t, when he is young, con&s;ider that he &s;hall one day be old; and remember, when he is old, that he has once been young.</P>
<P N="7">7. He who governs his pa&s;&s;ions does more than he who commands armies. Socrates, being one day offended with his &s;ervant, &s;aid, "I would beat you, if I were not angry."</P>
<P N="8">8. We too often judge of men by the &s;plendor, and not by the merit of their actions. Alexander demanded of a pirate whom he had taken, by what right he infe&s;ted the &s;eas? By the &s;ame right, replied he boldly, that you en|&s;lave the world. I am called a robber, becau&s;e I have on|ly one &s;mall ve&s;&s;el; but you are &s;tyled a conqueror, becau&s;e you command great fleets and armies.</P>
<P N="9">9. Beauty, as the flowery blo&s;&s;om, &s;oon fades; but the divine excellencies of the mind, like the medicinal virtues of the plant, remain in it when all tho&s;e charms are withered.</P>
<P N="10">10. There are two con&s;iderations which always em|bitter the heart of an avaricious man; the one is a perpet|ual thir&s;t after more riches; the other, the pro&s;pect of leaving what he hath already acquired.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="9" REF="026674_0009_0FD15559817EA120">11. There cannot be a more glorious object in creation, than a human being replete with benevolence, meditating in what manner he may render him&s;elf mo&s;t acceptable to his Creator, by doing mo&s;t good to his creatures.</P>
<P N="12">12. A man &s;hould never be a&s;hamed to own he has been in the wrong; which is but &s;aying, in other words, that he is wi&s;er to-day than he was ye&s;terday.</P>
<P N="13">13. Knowledge will not be acquired without pains and application. It is trouble&s;ome digging for deep, pure wa|ters; but when once you come to the &s;pring, they ri&s;e up and meet you.</P>
<P N="14">14. The mo&s;t unhappy effect of fa&s;hionable politene&s;s is, that it teaches us the art of di&s;pen&s;ing with virtues which it imitates. Let us be educated to cheri&s;h the principles of benevolence and humanity, and we &s;hall have politene&s;s enough, or &s;hall &s;tand in no need of it.</P>
<P N="15">15. If we &s;hould not have that which is accompanied by the graces, we &s;hould have that which be&s;peaks the ho|ne&s;t man, and the good citizen. We &s;hould &s;tand in no need of having recour&s;e to the fal&s;ehood of appearances.</P>
<P N="16">16. Man is the only being endowed with the power of laughter, and perhaps he is the only one who de&s;erves to be laughed at.</P>

It is the great privilege of poverty to be happy un|envied, to be healthful without phy&s;ic, and &s;ecure without a guard: to obtain from the bounty of nature what the great and wealthy are compelled to procure by the help of arti&s;ts, and the attendance of flatterers and &s;pies.</P>

<P N="30">30. To &s;et about acquiring the habit of meditation and &s;tudy late in life, is like getting into a go-cart with a grey beard, and learning to walk when we have lo&s;t the u&s;e of our legs. In general, the foundation of a happy old age mu&s;t be laid in youth; and he, who has not cultivated his rea&s;on young, will be utterly unable to improve it when old.</P>

<P>IT is to be wi&s;hed that parents would con&s;ider what a variety of circum&s;tances tend to render the evil reports of their children, re&s;pecting their teachers, fal&s;e and ex|aggerated.</P>
<P N="2">2. They judge ha&s;tily, partially, imperfectly, and im|properly, from the natural defects and weakne&s;s of their age. They, likewi&s;e, too often <HI>intentionally</HI> mi&s;repre&s;ent things. They hate tho&s;e who re&s;train them; they feel re&s;entment for correction; they love change; they love idlene&s;s, and the indulgencies of their home.</P>
<P N="3">3. Like all human creatures, they are apt not to know when they are well, and to complain. Let parents then con&s;ider the&s;e things impartially, and be cautious of a&s;per&s;ing the character, and di&s;turbing the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who may probably de&s;erve thanks rather than ill u&s;age; who&s;e office is at be&s;t full of care and anxiety; and, when it is in|terrupted by the injudicious interference or complaints of the parents, becomes intolerably burden&s;ome.</P>
<P N="4">4. If a father &s;u&s;pect his confidence to have been mi&s;|placed, it is be&s;t to withdraw it immediately, without alter|cation and without reproaches. It would al&s;o be an excel|lent method of con&s;ulting their own peace, and the welfare of their other &s;cholars, if ma&s;ters made a rule to exclude from their &s;chools the children of tho&s;e parents who are unju&s;tly di&s;contented.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF JOSEPH ABRIDGED.</HEAD>
<P>ISRAEL loved Jo&s;eph more than all his chil|dren, becau&s;e he was the &s;on of his old age; and he gave him a coat of many colours. But when his brethren &s;aw their father's partiality to him, they hated him, and would not &s;peak peaceably unto him. And Jo&s;eph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren.</P>
<P N="2">2. Behold, he &s;aid, we were binding &s;heaves in the field; and lo! my &s;heaf aro&s;e and &s;tood upright; and your &s;heaves &s;tood round about, and made obei&s;ance to my &s;heaf. And his brethren &s;aid unto him, Shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? and they hated him the more for his dreams, and for his words.</P>
<P N="3">3. It happened that his brethren went to feed their fa|ther's flock at Dothan. And Jo&s;eph went after his breth|ren; but, when they &s;aw him afar off, they con&s;pired again&s;t him to &s;lay him; and they &s;aid one to another, We will tell our father that &s;ome evil bea&s;t hath devoured him.</P>
<P N="4">4. But Reuben wi&s;hed to deliver him out of their hands: and he &s;aid, Let us not kill him, but ca&s;t him into this pit, that is in the wilderne&s;s. And they followed his coun&s;el, and ca&s;t him into the pit, which then contained no water.</P>
<P N="5">5. A company of I&s;hmaelites from Gilead pa&s;&s;ed by, at this time, with their camels, bearing &s;picery, balm, and myrrh, which they were carrying into Egypt. And Judah &s;aid unto his brethren, Let us &s;ell Jo&s;eph to the I&s;hmaelites, and let not our hands be upon him, for he is our brother and our fle&s;h. And Jo&s;eph was &s;old for twenty pieces of &s;ilver.</P>
<P N="6">6. And his brethren killed a kid, and dipped his coat in the blood thereof. And they brought it unto their father,
<PB N="15" REF="026674_0015_0FD155616F974DC8">
and &s;aid, This have we found. And Jacob knew it; and believing that Jo&s;eph was devoured by an evil bea&s;t, he rent his clothes, and put &s;ackcloth on his loins, and refu&s;ed all comfort, &s;aying, I will go down into the grave to my &s;on, mourning.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thus wept his father for him. But Jo&s;eph was car|ried into Egypt, and &s;old to Potiphar, the captain of Pha|raoh's guard. And the Lord was with him, and pro&s;pered him; and he found favor in the &s;ight of his ma&s;ter. But by the wickedne&s;s of Potiphar's wife, he was ca&s;t into the pri&s;on, where the king's pri&s;oners were bound.</P>
<P N="8">8. Here al&s;o the Lord continued to &s;how him mercy, and gave him favor in the &s;ight of the keeper of the pri&s;|on. And all the pri&s;oners were committed to his care; among&s;t whom were two of Pharaoh's officers, the chief of the butlers, and the chief of the bakers.</P>
<P N="9">9. And Jo&s;eph interpreted the dreams of the king's &s;er+vants; and his interpretation being true, the chief butler recommended him to Pharaoh, who had dreamed a dream, which Jo&s;eph thus &s;howed unto him. Behold there &s;hall come &s;even years of great plenty, throughout all the land of Egypt. And there &s;hall ari&s;e after them &s;even years of famine; and all the plenty &s;hall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine &s;hall con&s;ume the land.</P>
<P N="10">10. And the king &s;aid unto Jo&s;eph, Fora&s;much as God hath &s;hown you all this, thou &s;halt be over mine hou&s;e; and according to thy word &s;hall all my people be ruled. And Jo&s;eph gathered up all the food of the &s;even years, and laid up the food in &s;tore hou&s;es. Then the &s;even years of dearth began to come, as Jo&s;eph had foretold.</P>
<P N="11">11. But in all the land of Egypt there was bread; and people from all countries came unto Jo&s;eph to buy corn, becau&s;e the famine was &s;ore in all the lands. Now, among&s;t tho&s;e who came, were the ten &s;ons of Jacob, from the land of Canaan.</P>
<P N="12">12. And Jo&s;eph &s;aw his brethren, and he knew them, but made him&s;elf &s;trange unto them, and &s;pake roughly to them, &s;aying, Ye are &s;pies. And they &s;aid, Thy &s;ervants are twelve brethren, the &s;ons of one man in the land of Ca|naan; and behold the younge&s;t is this day with our father, and one is not.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="16" REF="026674_0016_0FD155636CFDF990">13. But Jo&s;eph &s;aid unto them, Ye &s;hall not go forth hence, except your younge&s;t brother come hither. Let one of your brethren be bound in pri&s;on, and go ye to car|ry corn for the famine of your hou&s;es, and bring your young|e&s;t brother unto me.</P>
<P N="14">14. And their con&s;ciences reproached them; and they &s;aid one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we &s;aw the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, when he be&s;ought us, and we would not hear. Therefore is this di&s;tre&s;s come upon us.</P>
<P N="15">15. And they knew not that Jo&s;eph under&s;tood them, for he &s;pake unto them by an interpreter. And he turned him&s;elf about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and commoned with them; and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. And they re|turned unto Jacob, their father, in the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them.</P>
<P N="16">16. And Jacob, their father, &s;aid unto them, Me ye have bereaved of my children. Jo&s;eph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away al&s;o. But my &s;on &s;hall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If mi&s;chief befal him in the way in which ye go, then &s;hall ye bring down my grey hairs with &s;orrow to the grave.</P>
<P N="17">17. But the famine continued &s;ore in the land; and when they had eaten up the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob &s;aid unto them, Go again and buy us food. And if it mu&s;t be &s;o, now take al&s;o your brother Benjamin, and ari&s;e, and go unto the man. And they brought pre&s;ents unto Jo&s;eph, and bowed them&s;elves to him to the earth.</P>
<P N="18">18. And he a&s;ked them of their welfare; and &s;aid, Is your father well? Is he alive? And he lifted up his eyes and &s;aw Benjamin his brother; and he was moved with com|pa&s;&s;ion; and he &s;ought where to weep, and he entered his chamber and wept there. And he wa&s;hed his face, and went out, and refrained him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="19">19. Then he commanded the &s;teward of his hou&s;e, &s;ay|ing, Fill the men's &s;acks with food, as much as they can car|ry, and put my cup, the &s;ilver cup, into the &s;ack of Benja|min the younge&s;t. And the &s;teward did according to the

<P N="20">20. But Jo&s;eph commanded his &s;teward to follow them, and to &s;earch their &s;acks, and to bring them back. And when Judah and his brethren were returned into the city, Jo&s;eph &s;aid unto them, What deed is this ye have done? the man, in who&s;e hands the cup is found, &s;hall be my &s;er|vant; and as for you, get you in peace unto your father.</P>
<P N="21">21. But they &s;aid, Our father will &s;urely die, if he &s;eeth that the lad is not with us; and we &s;hall bring down the grey hairs of thy &s;ervant, our father, with &s;orrow to the grave. Then Jo&s;eph could not refrain him&s;elf before all them that &s;tood by him; and he cried, Cau&s;e every man to go out from me; and there &s;tood no man with him, whil&s;t Jo&s;eph made him&s;elf known unto his brethren.</P>
<P N="22">22. And he wept aloud, and &s;aid unto his brethren, I am Jo&s;eph; doth my father yet live? and his brethren could not an&s;wer him, for they were troubled at his pre&s;ence. And Jo&s;eph &s;aid to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you; and they came near. And he &s;aid, I am Jo&s;eph your brother, whom ye &s;old into Egypt.</P>
<P N="23">23. Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with your|&s;elves, that ye &s;old me hither; for God did &s;end me before you, to &s;ave your lives by a great deliverance.

<P N="25">25. And behold your eyes &s;ee, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth which &s;peaketh unto you. And you &s;hall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and all which you have &s;een; and ye &s;hall ha&s;te, and bring down my father hither.</P>
<P N="26">26. And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. Moreover, he ki&s;&s;ed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after that,

<P N="6">6. With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, as I con&s;i&s;t of two parts, a body and a mind, my duty to my&s;elf again &s;eparates it&s;elf into two corre&s;pondent &s;ubdivi&s;ions. My body is a machine curiou&s;ly organized, and ea&s;ily deranged by exce&s;s and ir|regularity.</P>
<P N="7">7. When di&s;turbed in its economy, it &s;ubjects me to pain, and di&s;ables me from all nece&s;&s;ary and plea&s;ant exer|tion. I owe it therefore to my&s;elf, to ta&s;te the cup, and partake the banquet, and gratify all my &s;en&s;es, no further than tho&s;e limits which are obviou&s;ly pre&s;cribed by rea&s;on and experience.</P>
<P N="8">8. I further learn from the religion of my country, that my body is the temple of the holy Spirit. To pollute it with pre&s;umptuous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion cannot but be bla&s;phemy; to devote my&s;elf to gluttony, drunkenne&s;s, and debauchery, is at once to deaden the growing energies of &s;piritual life, and to weaken and de&s;troy the &s;ubordinate, yet nece&s;&s;ary parts of me, my animal and material fabric; it is to &s;horten life, and to di&s;able me from performing its duties while it continues.</P>
<P N="9">9. But I have al&s;o a mind capable of ri&s;ing to high im|provements by culture, and of &s;inking to a brutal &s;tupidity by neglect. I will make u&s;e of all the advantages of education. I will devote my hours of lei&s;ure to reading and reflection.</P>
<P N="10">10. Elegant letters, as well as u&s;eful &s;ciences, &s;hall claim my attention; for all which tends to poli&s;h the mind, tends al&s;o to &s;weeten the temper, and to mitigate the remains of natural ferocity.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="20" REF="026674_0020_0FD1556BB0037930">11. My mind, as well as my body, is greatly concerned in avoiding intemperance. Eating to exce&s;s clouds its brightne&s;s, blunts its edge, and drags it down to all the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of materiality. Intemperate drinking not only reduces it, at the time of its immediate influence, to a &s;tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of brutality, but gradually de&s;troys all its vigor.</P>
<P N="12">12. The &s;en&s;ual indulgencies in general, when they are inordinate and exce&s;&s;ive, deba&s;e, corrupt, and brutalize. Their delights are tran&s;ient, their pains &s;evere and of long duration.</P>
<P N="13">13. In&s;tead then of running into the danger of tempta|tion, during the ardor of youth, I will fly from the conflict, in which my own pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ure to fight again&s;t me, and will probably betray me to the enemy.</P>
<P N="14">14. I &s;ee, indeed, thou&s;ands pur&s;uing plea&s;ure, and pro|fe&s;&s;ing to have found it in perfection in the haunts of de|bauchery. But I &s;ee them but for a little while. Like the &s;illy in&s;ect which flutters with delight around the taper, they &s;oon receive &s;ome fatal injury in their minds, their per|&s;ons or their fortunes, and drop into irrecoverable ruin.</P>
<P N="15">15. Alas! I am too much inclined to vice, from the depravity of my nature, and the violence of my pa&s;&s;ions. I will not add fuel to the fire, nor increa&s;e the violence of that natural tempe&s;t within me, which of it&s;elf is &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h my de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="16">16. But, at the &s;ame time, I will not be a cynic. The world abounds with innocent enjoyments. The kind God of nature intended that I &s;hould ta&s;te them. But modera|tion is e&s;&s;ential to true plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="17">17. My own experience, and the experience of mankind from their origin, has declared, that whenever plea&s;ure ex|ceeds the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds of moderation, it is not only highly inju|rious, but di&s;gu&s;tful. In order to enjoy plea&s;ure, I &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with attention.</P>
<P N="18">18. The vici&s;&s;itude is nece&s;&s;ary to excite an appetite and give a reli&s;h. Nay, the very performance of bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;kill and &s;ucce&s;s, is attended with a delightful &s;atisfaction, which few of the mo&s;t boa&s;ted plea&s;ures are able to confer.</P>
<P N="19">19. While I take care of my&s;elf, of my health, of my improvement in morals and under&s;tanding, I will not harbor pride, or look down with &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s or ill nature on
<PB N="21" REF="026674_0021_0FD1556C991FEE38">
tho&s;e who live, as it were, at random, and who acknowledge no other guide of their conduct, but the &s;udden impul&s;e of a temporary inclination.</P>
<P N="20">20. With all my improvements and endeavors, I &s;hall &s;till feel imperfections enough to humble me. Candor and humility are &s;ome of the lea&s;t fallible marks of &s;ound &s;en&s;e and &s;incere virtue. I &s;hall have &s;ufficient employment in correcting my&s;elf; nor &s;hall I pre&s;ume to cen&s;ure others, unle&s;s my profe&s;&s;ion or relative &s;ituation render it my duty.</P>
<P N="21">21. My duty to my&s;elf is, indeed, intimately connected with my duty to oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s. By pre&s;erving the faculties of my mind and body, and by improving them to the utmo&s;t, I am enabled to exert them with effect in the &s;ervice of &s;oci|ety. I am connected with others by the ties of con&s;an|guinity and friend&s;hip, and by the common bond of parta|king in the &s;ame humanity.</P>
<P N="22">22. As a &s;on, I &s;hall be tender and dutiful; as a brother, uniformly affectionate; as a hu&s;band, faithful and friendly; as a father, kind and provident; as a man, be|nevolent to men in whatever circum&s;tances, and however &s;eparated from me by country, religion, or government.</P>
<P N="23">23. But univer&s;al benevolence mu&s;t not be an inactive principle. If it proceed not to real beneficence, I fear it will have more in it of o&s;tentation than of &s;incerity. I will then prove its &s;incerity by doing good, and removing evil of every kind, as far as my abilities allow me, and my influence extends.</P>
<P N="24">24. But before I pretend to genero&s;ity, I will be &s;trict|ly ju&s;t. Truth &s;hall regulate my words, and equity my ac|tions. If I am engaged in a profe&s;&s;ion, I will do the duties of it; if in merchandize, I will take no advantage of the ignorant, nor deba&s;e my character, nor wound my con|&s;cience, for the &s;ake of gain.</P>
<P N="25">25. In all my intercour&s;e with &s;ociety, I will recollect that heavenly precept of doing to others as I wi&s;h they &s;hould do to me; and will endeavor to obey it. I may, I certainly &s;hall offend from the violence of my pa&s;&s;ions, the weakne&s;s of my judgment, the perver&s;ene&s;s of my will, and from mi&s;take and mi&s;apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="26">26. But while I keep the evangelical rule in view, and &s;incerely labor to conform to it, I &s;hall &s;eldom commit &s;uch
<PB N="22" REF="026674_0022_0FD1556E4070D6B8">
offences again&s;t others, as will be either permanently or deeply injurious.</P>
<P N="27">27. With re&s;pect to my duty to my Creator, I derive an argument in favor of religion, from the feelings of my own bo&s;om, &s;uperior to the mo&s;t elaborate &s;ubtilties of hu|man ingenuity. In the hour of di&s;tre&s;s, my heart as natu|rally flies for &s;uccor to the Deity, as when hungry and thir&s;ty, I &s;eek food and water; or when weary, repo&s;e.</P>
<P N="28">28. In religion I look for comfort, and in religion I al|ways find it. Devotion &s;upplies me with a pure and ex|alted plea&s;ure. It elevates my &s;oul, and teaches me to look down with proper contempt upon many objects which are eagerly &s;ought, but which end in mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="29">29. In this re&s;pect, and in many others, it effects in the be&s;t and mo&s;t compendious method, what has been in vain pretended to by proud philo&s;ophy. And in &s;electing a mode or peculiar &s;y&s;tem of religion, I &s;hall con&s;ider what that was in which my father lived and died.</P>
<P N="30">30. I find it to have been the religion of Chri&s;t. I ex|amine it with reverence. I encounter many difficulties; but, at the &s;ame time, I feel within me an internal evidence, which, uniting its force with the external, forbids me to di&s;believe.</P>
<P N="31">31. When involuntary doubts ari&s;e, I immediately &s;i|lence their importunity by recollecting the weakne&s;s of my judgment, and the vain pre&s;umption of ha&s;tily deciding on the mo&s;t important of all &s;ubjects, again&s;t &s;uch powerful evidence, and again&s;t the major part of the civilized world.</P>
<P N="32">32. I will learn humility of the humble Je&s;us, and grate|fully accept the beneficial doctrines and glorious offers, which his benign religion reaches out to all who &s;incerely &s;eek him by prayer and penitence.</P>
<P N="33">33. In vain &s;hall the conceited philo&s;ophers, whom fa&s;hion and ignorance admire, attempt to weaken my belief, or undermine the principles of my morality. Without their aid, I can be &s;ufficiently wicked, and &s;ufficiently mi&s;erable.</P>
<P N="34">34. Human life abounds with evil. I will &s;eek bal&s;ams for the wounds of the heart in the &s;weets of innocence, and in the con&s;olations of religion. Virtue, I am convinced, is the noble&s;t ornament of humanity, and the &s;ource of the
<PB N="23" REF="026674_0023_0FD1557000014C08">
&s;ublime&s;t, and the &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ure; and piety leads to that peace, which the world, and all it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, cannot be&s;tow.</P>
<P N="35">35. Let others enjoy the pride and plea&s;ure of being call|ed philo&s;ophers, dei&s;ts, &s;ceptics; be mine the real, uno&s;ten|tatious qualities of the hone&s;t, humble, and charitable Chri&s;|tian. When the gaudy glories of fa&s;hion and vain philo&s;o|phy &s;hall have withered like a &s;hort-lived &s;lower, &s;incere piety and moral hone&s;ty &s;hall flouri&s;h as the cedar of Lebanon.</P>
<P N="36">36. But I repre&s;s my triumphs. After all my improve|ments, and all my pantings for perfection, I &s;hall &s;till be greatly defective. Therefore, to whatever degree of ex|cellence I advance, let me never forget to &s;how to others that indulgence, which my infirmities, my errors, and my voluntary mi&s;conduct, will require both from them, and from mine and their Almighty and mo&s;t merciful Father.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHILD TRAINED UP FOR THE GAL|LOWS.</HEAD>

Let him particularly inure him to &s;pend the Lord's day in play and liver&s;ion, in&s;tead of attending on public wor&s;hip; and in&s;tead of in&s;truct|ing him, on that day, in the principles of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, let him rob a neighbouring hen-roo&s;t, while the pro|prietor of it is gone to divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P N="2">2. A&s;toni&s;hing it is to &s;ee &s;o many of our young people growing up without being apprenticed to any bu&s;ine&s;s for procuring their future livelihood! The Jews had a proverb, "That whoever was not bred to a trade, was bred for the gallows." Every mu&s;&s;ulman is commanded by the Koran to learn &s;ome handicraft or other; and to this precept, even the family of the grand Signior &s;o far conform, as to learn as much about the mechani&s;m of a watch, as to be able to take it in pieces, and to put it together again.</P>
<P N="3">3. Are Chri&s;tians the only people in the world, who are to live in idlene&s;s, when one of the injunctions of the

"This we command|ed you," &s;ays he, "that if any would not work, neither &s;hould he eat." "Train up a child," &s;ays king Solomon, "in the way he <HI>&s;hould</HI> go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it."</P>
<P N="4">4. But if you intend him for the gallows, train him up in the way he <HI>would</HI> go; and before he is old, he will prob|ably be hanged. In the age of vanity, re&s;train him not from the follies and allurements of it. In the age proper for learning and in&s;truction, give him neither. As to cat|echi&s;ing him, it is an old fa&s;hioned, puritanical, u&s;ele&s;s for|mality. Never heed it, le&s;t his mind be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nhappily bia&s;&s;ed by the influence of a religious education.</P>

But we know that Mo&s;es did not intend tho&s;e children to be trained up for the gallows. His advice there|fore is not to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. Mine, which is immediately directed to the object in view, mu&s;t con&s;equently be very different. And para|mount to any other direction which I can po&s;&s;ibly give, I would particularly advi&s;e, as an e&s;&s;ential part of the cour&s;e of this education, by which a child, when he arrives to man|hood, is intended to make &s;o <HI>exalted</HI> a figure, that his pa|rents &s;hould &s;uffer him every &s;abbath day, during &s;ummer and autumn, to patrol about the neighborhood, and to &s;teal as much fruit as he can carry off.</P>
<P N="7">7. To encourage him more in this branch of his educa|tion, in ca&s;e the poor &s;crupulous lad &s;hould &s;how any com|punctions of con&s;cience about it, I would have his mother partake of the &s;tolen fruit; and eat it with keener appe|tite than &s;he does any of her own, or her hu&s;band's lawful|ly acquired earnings. For his further encouragement, both his parents &s;hould always take his part, whenever the pro|prietor of the &s;tolen fruit prefers to them his complaint again&s;t him; and by all means refu&s;e to cha&s;ti&s;e him for his thievery.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF FIDELIA.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon the particular parts of Fidelia's character, it is nece&s;&s;ary to preface, that &s;he is the only child of a decrepid father, who&s;e life is bound up in hers. This gentleman has u&s;ed Fidelia from her infan|cy with all the tenderne&s;s imaginable; and has viewed her growing perfections with the partiality of a parent, who &s;oon thought her accompli&s;hed above the children of all other men; but never thought &s;he was come to the highe&s;t im|provement of which &s;he her&s;elf was capable.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="26" REF="026674_0026_0FD155770E8B4058">2. This fondne&s;s has had very plea&s;ing effects upon his own happine&s;s; for &s;he reads, &s;he dances, &s;he &s;ings, u&s;es her &s;pinet and guitar to the utmo&s;t perfection. And the young lady's u&s;e of all the&s;e excellencies, is to divert the old man in his ea&s;y chair, when he is out of the pangs of a chronical di&s;temper.</P>
<P N="3">3. Fidelia is now in the twenty-third year of her age; but the application of many admirers, her quick &s;en&s;e of all that is truly elegant and noble in the enjoyment of a plenti|ful fortune, are not able to draw her from the &s;ide of her good old father. Certain it is, that there is no kind of af|fection &s;o pure and angelic, as that of a father to a daughter.</P>
<P N="4">4. Fidelia on her part, as I was going to &s;ay, as accom|pli&s;hed as &s;he is, with all her beauty, wit, air and mien, em|ploys her whole time in care and attendance upon her fa|ther. How have I been charmed to &s;ee one of the mo&s;t beauteous women the age has produced, kneeling to help on an old man's &s;lipper! Her filial regard to him is what &s;he makes her diver&s;ion, her bu&s;ine&s;s, and her glory.</P>
<P N="5">5. When &s;he was a&s;ked by a friend of her decea&s;ed mo|ther, to admit of the court&s;hip of her &s;on, &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he had a great re&s;pect and gratitude to her for the over|ture in behalf of one &s;o near to her, but that during her fa|ther's life, &s;he would admit into her heart no value for any thing which &s;hould interfere with her endeavors to make his remains of life as happy and ea&s;y as could be expected in his circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="6">6. The happy father has her declaration, that &s;he will not marry during his life, and the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing that re|&s;olution not unea&s;y to her. Were one to paint filial affec|tion in its utmo&s;t beauty, he could not have a more lively idea of it than in beholding Fidelia &s;erving her father at his hours of ri&s;ing, meals, and re&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. When the general croud of female youth are con&s;ult|ing their gla&s;&s;es, preparing for balls, a&s;&s;emblies, or plays; for a young lady, who could be rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed among the fore|mo&s;t in tho&s;e places, either for her per&s;on, wit, fortune, or conver&s;ation, and yet contemn all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e entertainments, to &s;weeten the heavy hours of a decrepid parent, is a re&s;igna|tion truly heroic.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="27" REF="026674_0027_0FD155781BFAE338">8. Fidelia performs the duty of a nur&s;e with all the beau|ty of a bride; nor does &s;he neglect her per&s;on, becau&s;e of her attendance upon him, when he is too ill to receive com|pany, to whom &s;he may make an appearance.</P>
<P N="9">9. Fidelia, who gives him up her youth, does not think it any great &s;acrifice to add to it the &s;poiling of her dre&s;s. Her care and exactne&s;s in her habit convince her father of the alacrity of her mind; and &s;he has of all women the be&s;t foundation for affecting the prai&s;e of a &s;eeming negligence.</P>
<P N="10">10. Tho&s;e who think them&s;elves the pattern of good breeding, and refinement, would be a&s;toni&s;hed to hear, that, in tho&s;e intervals, when the old gentleman is at ea&s;e, and can bear company, there are at his hou&s;e in the mo&s;t regu|lar order, a&s;&s;emblies of people of the highe&s;t merit; where there is conver&s;ation without mention of the ab&s;ent, and the highe&s;t &s;ubjects of morality treated of as natural and accidental di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="11">11. All of which is owing to the genius of Fidelia, who at once makes her father's way to another world ea&s;y, and her&s;elf capable of being an honor to his name in <HI>this.</HI></P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF JERUSALEM.</HEAD>
<P>ACCORDING to Manetho, an Egyptian hi&s;torian, Jeru&s;alem was founded by the &s;hepherds who in|vaded Egypt in an unknown period of antiquity. Accord|ing to Jo&s;ephus, it was the capital of Melchizedeck's king|dom, and built in honor of that prince, by twelve neighbor|ing kings.</P>
<P N="2">2. We know nothing of it with certainty, however, till the time of king David, who took it from the Jebu&s;ites, and made it the capital of his kingdom. It was fir&s;t taken in the days of Jehoa&s;h, by Hazael, king of A&s;&s;yria, who &s;lew all the nobility, but did not de&s;troy their city.</P>
<P N="3">3. It was afterwards taken by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who de&s;troyed it, and carried away the inhab|itants. Seventy years after, permi&s;&s;ion was granted by Cyrus king of Per&s;ia to the Jews to rebuild their city, which was done; and it continued the capital of Judea till the
<PB N="28" REF="026674_0028_0FD1557A0DE2E6B0">
time of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, emperor of Rome, by who&s;e &s;on Titus it was totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was, however, rebuilt by Adrian, and &s;eemed likely to recover its former grandeur; but it flouri&s;hed for a &s;hort time only. When the empre&s;s Helena, mother of Con&s;tantine the great, came to vi&s;it it, &s;he found it in a mo&s;t forlorn and ruinous &s;ituation.</P>
<P N="5">5. Having formed a de&s;ign of re&s;toring it to its ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tre, &s;he cau&s;ed, with a great deal of co&s;t and labor, all the rubbi&s;h which had been thrown upon tho&s;e places where our Saviour had &s;uffered, been buried, &amp;c. to be removed.</P>
<P N="6">6. In doing this, they found the cro&s;s on which he died, as well as tho&s;e of the two malefactors who &s;uffered with him. She then cau&s;ed a magnificent church to be built, which enclo&s;ed as many &s;cenes of our Saviour's &s;uf|ferings as could conveniently be done.</P>
<P N="7">7. This church, which &s;tands on mount Calvary, is &s;till in good repair, being &s;upported by the donations of pilgrims who are con&s;tantly re&s;orting to it. Here is to be &s;een our Saviour's &s;epulchre, hewn out of a &s;olid rock; and the very hole in the rock in which it is &s;aid the foot of the cro&s;s was fixed, with many other curio&s;ities.</P>

The height of this building on one &s;ide was at lea&s;t 960 feet; and the &s;tones employ|ed about the ramparts, were, according to Jo&s;ephus, 40 cu|bits long, 12 thick, and 8 high, all of poli&s;hed marble, and &s;o well joined as to appear like one &s;olid rock.</P>
<P N="9">9. After the de&s;truction of this temple, it is &s;aid that the emperor Julian attempted to rebuild it, in order to give the lie to our Saviour's prophecy, namely, that it &s;hould be totally de&s;troyed without one &s;tone's being left upon an|other. In this, however, he was defeated by earthquakes, fiery eruptions, &amp;c. which de&s;troyed his materials, and kil|led many of his workmen.</P>

<HEAD>THE FAITHFUL AMERICAN DOG.</HEAD>
<P>AN officer in the late American army, on his &s;tation at the we&s;tward, went out in the morning with his dog and gun, in que&s;t of game. Venturing too far from the garri&s;on, he was fired upon by an Indian, who was lurk|ing in the bu&s;hes, and in&s;tantly fell to the ground.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Indian running to him, &s;truck him on the head with his tomahawk in order to di&s;patch him; but the but|ton of his hat fortunately warding off the edge, he was on|ly &s;tunned by the blow. With &s;avage brutality he applied the &s;calping knife, and ha&s;tened away with this trophy of his horrid cruelty, leaving the officer for dead, and none to relieve or con&s;ole him, but his faithful dog.</P>
<P N="3">3. The afflicted creature gave every expre&s;&s;ion of his at|tachment, fidelity, and affection. He licked the wounds with inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s, and mourned the fate of his beloved ma&s;ter. Having performed every office which &s;ym|pathy dictated, or &s;agacity could invent, without being able to remove his ma&s;ter from the fatal &s;pot, or procure from him any &s;igns of life, or his wonted expre&s;&s;ions of affection to him, he ran off in que&s;t of help.</P>
<P N="4">4. Bending his cour&s;e towards the river, where two men were fi&s;hing, he urged them by all the powers of native rhet|oric to accompany him to the woods. The men were &s;u&s;|picious of a decoy to an ambu&s;cade, and dared not venture to follow the dog; who, finding all his care&s;&s;es fail, return|ed to the care of his ma&s;ter; and, licking his wounds a &s;econd time, renewed all his tenderne&s;&s;es; but with no better &s;ucce&s;s than before.</P>
<P N="5">5. Again he returned to the men; once more to try his &s;kill in alluring them to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In this attempt he was more &s;ucce&s;sful than in the other. The men &s;eeing his &s;olicitude, began to think the dog might have di&s;covered &s;ome valuable game, and determined to hazard the con&s;e|quences of following him.</P>
<P N="6">6. Tran&s;ported with his &s;ucce&s;s, the affectionate crea|ture hurried them along by every expre&s;&s;ion of ardor. Pre&s;|ently they arrive at the &s;pot, where behold&mdash;an officer
<PB N="30" REF="026674_0030_0FD1557C6E9E1118">
wounded, &s;calped, weltering in his own gore, and faint with the lo&s;s of blood.</P>
<P N="7">7. Suffice it to &s;ay, he was yet alive. They carried him to the fort, where the fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ings were performed. A &s;uppuration immediately took place, and he was &s;oon con|veyed to the ho&s;pital at Albany, where in a few weeks, he entirely recovered, and was able to return to his duty.</P>
<P N="8">8. This worthy officer owed his life, probably, to the fidelity of this &s;agacious dog. His tongue, which the gen|tleman afterwards declared gave him the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure, clarified the wound in the mo&s;t effectual manner, and his per&s;everance brought that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, without which he mu&s;t &s;oon have peri&s;hed.</P>
<P N="9">9.

<HEAD>FILIAL DUTY AND AFFECTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Stork is generally e&s;teemed an em|blem of filial love; in&s;omuch, that it has ever acquired the name of <HI>pious,</HI> from the ju&s;t regard it is &s;aid to pay to acts of filial piety and duty.</P>
<P N="2">2. Storks live to a very advanced age; the con&s;equence of which is, that their limbs grow feeble, their feathers fall off, and they are no ways capable of providing for their own food or &s;afety. Being birds of pa&s;&s;age, they are un|der another inconvenience al&s;o, which is, that they are not able to remove them&s;elves from one country to another at the u&s;ual &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P N="3">3. In all the&s;e circum&s;tances it is reported that their young ones a&s;&s;i&s;t them, covering them with their wings, and nouri&s;hing them with the warmth of their bodies; even bringing them provi&s;ions in their beaks, and carrying them from place to place on their backs, or &s;upporting them with their wings.</P>
<P N="4">4. In this manner they return, as much as lies in their power, the care which was be&s;towed on them when they
<PB N="31" REF="026674_0031_0FD1557DE0B9F1E8">
were young ones in the ne&s;t. A &s;triking example of filial piety, in&s;pired by in&s;tinct; from which <HI>rea&s;on</HI> it&s;elf needs not be a&s;hamed to take example.</P>
<P N="5">5. "Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee," was an expre&s;s commandment, and the only one to which a promi&s;e was annexed. Among the I&s;raelites, the &s;lighte&s;t offence again&s;t a parent was puni&s;hed in the mo&s;t exemplary manner.</P>
<P N="6">6. Certainly nothing can be more ju&s;t or rea&s;onable, than that we &s;hould love, honor, and &s;uccor tho&s;e who are the very authors of our being, and to who&s;e tender care (under Heaven) we owe the continuance of it, during the helple&s;s &s;tate of our infancy.</P>
<P N="7">7. Love, charity, and an intercour&s;e of good offices, are what we undoubtedly owe to all mankind; and he who omits them is guilty of &s;uch a crime as generally carries its puni&s;hment with it.</P>
<P N="8">8. But to our parents, more, much more than all this, is due; and, when we are &s;erving them, we ought to reflect, that whatever difficulties we go through for their &s;akes, we cannot do more for them than they have done for us; and that there is no danger of our over-paying the va&s;t debt of gratitude they have laid us under.</P>
<P N="9">9. In fine, we &s;hould con&s;ider that it is a duty mo&s;t pe|culiarly in&s;i&s;ted on by Heaven it&s;elf; and, if we obey the command, there is no doubt but we &s;hall al&s;o receive the re|ward annexed to it.</P>

<HEAD>THE BEE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bee is a noble pattern of indu&s;try and prudence. She &s;ettles upon every plant and flower, and makes the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant, nay, even the mo&s;t hurtful of them, u&s;eful to her purpo&s;e. Thus &s;he toils all the &s;ummer, while the days are fair, in order to get a &s;tock, which &s;he lays by to &s;erve for winter, when the herbs and flowers are dead, the trees deprived of their leaves, and the weather unfavorable.</P>

Then the Bees retire to their hive, which is formed like a little &s;tate, and governed by a Queen, who di&s;pen&s;es ju&s;tice to her &s;ubjects. It is &s;aid they bury their dead, pun|i&s;h criminals, and drive the drones from their hive. They keep a regular order, whether in war or peace; and, as &s;oon as their Queen dies, appoint another to &s;ucceed her, and rule their little &s;tate, which may &s;erve as a pattern for a well ordered community.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Bee is one of the apte&s;t emblems of indu&s;try, and the art of extracting good out of evil, that can be found in nature. It is endued with an in&s;tinct, which ju&s;tly ex|cites our admiration; and its per&s;everance is an admirable example for the wi&s;e&s;t of us to follow.</P>

<HEAD>OF QUEEN MARY, AND THE MARTYRS.</HEAD>
<P>MARY po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed few qualities either e&s;tima|ble or amiable. Her per&s;on was as little engaging as her manner. And, amid&s;t the complication of vices which en|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ered into her compo&s;ition, ob&s;tinacy, bigotry, violence, cru|elty, we &s;carcely find any virtue but &s;incerity; unle&s;s we add vigor of mind, a quality, which &s;eems to have been in|herent in her family.</P>
<P N="2">2. During this queen's reign, per&s;ecution for religion was carried to the mo&s;t terrible height. The mild coun&s;els of cardinal Pole, who was inclined to toleration, was over|ruled by Gardner and Bonner; and multitudes of all con|ditions, ages, and &s;exes, were committed to the flames.</P>
<P N="3">3. The per&s;ecutors began with Rogers, prebendary of St. Paul's; a man equally di&s;tingui&s;hed by his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty and learning; but who&s;e dome&s;tic &s;ituation, it was hoped, would bring him to compliance.</P>
<P N="4">4. He had a wife, whom he tenderly loved, and ten children; yet did he continue firm in his principles. And &s;uch was his &s;erenity after condemnation, that the jailers, it is &s;aid, awaked him from a &s;ound &s;leep, when the hour of his execution approached. He &s;uffered at Smithfield.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hooper, bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, was condemned at the &s;ame time with Rogers, but was &s;ent to his own dioce&s;e to be puni&s;hed, in order to &s;trike the greater terror into his flock. His con&s;tancy at his death, however, had a very contrary effect.</P>
<P N="6">6. It was a &s;cene of con&s;olation to Hooper, to die in their &s;ight, bearing te&s;timony to that doctrine which he had

<P N="8">8. Latimer, when tied to the &s;take, called to his com|panion, "Be of good cheer, my brother; we &s;hall this day kindle &s;uch a flame in England, as I tru&s;t in God will never be extingui&s;hed."</P>
<P N="9">9. Sanders, a re&s;pectable clergyman, was committed to the flames at Coventry. A pardon was offered him, if he would recant; but he rejected it with di&s;dain, and em|braced the &s;take, &s;aying, "Welcome, cro&s;s of Chri&s;t! welcome, everla&s;ting life!"</P>
<P N="10">10. Cranmer had le&s;s courage at fir&s;t. Terrified by the pro&s;pect of tho&s;e tortures which awaited him, or overcome by the fond love of life, and by the flattery of artful men, who pompou&s;ly repre&s;ented the dignities to which his char|acter &s;till entitled him, if he would merit them by a recanta|tion, he agreed, in an unguarded hour, to &s;ub&s;cribe to the doctrines of the papal &s;upremacy, and the real pre&s;ence.</P>
<P N="11">11. But the court, no le&s;s perfidious than cruel, deter|mined that this recantation &s;hould avail him nothing; that he &s;hould acknowledge his errors in the church before the people, and afterwards be led to execution.</P>
<P N="12">12. Whether Cranmer received &s;ecret intelligence of their de&s;ign, or repented of his weakne&s;s, or both, is uncer|tain; but he &s;urpri&s;ed the audience by a declaration, very different from what was expected.</P>
<P N="13">13. After explaining his &s;en&s;e of what he owed to God and his &s;overeign, "There is one mi&s;carriage in my life, &s;aid he, of which, above all others, I &s;everely repent; and that is, the in&s;incere declaration of faith, to which I had the weakne&s;s to &s;ub&s;cribe.</P>
<P N="14">14. "But I take this opportunity of atoning for my error, by a &s;incere and open recantation; and am willing to &s;eal with my blood that doctrine, which I firmly believe to be communicated from heaven."</P>

<P N="16">16. His thoughts, to u&s;e the words of an elegant and learned hi&s;torian, appeared to be totally occupied in reflect|ing on his former fault; and he called aloud &s;everal times, "This hand has offended! This wicked hand has of|fended!"</P>
<P N="17">17. When it dropped off, he di&s;covered a &s;erenity in his countenance, as if &s;atisfied with &s;acrificing to divine ju&s;|tice the in&s;trument of his crime.

<HEAD>STORY OF LOGAN, A MINGO CHIEF.</HEAD>
<P>IN the &s;pring of the year 1774, a robbery and murder were committed on an inhabitant of the frontiers of Virginia by two Indians, of the Shawane&s;e tribe. The neighboring whites, according to their cu&s;tom, undertook to puni&s;h this outrage in a &s;ummary way. Colonel Cre&s;ap, a man infamous for the many murders he had committed on tho&s;e much injured people, collected a party, and pro|ceeded down the Kanhaway in que&s;t of vengeance.</P>
<P N="2">2. Unfortunately, a canoe of women and children, with one man only, was &s;een coming from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, un|armed, and un&s;u&s;pecting any ho&s;tile attack from the whites. Cre&s;ap and his party concealed them&s;elves on the bank of the river; and the moment the canoe reached the &s;hore, &s;ingled out their objects, and, at one fire, killed every per|&s;on in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. This happened to be the family of Logan, who had long been di&s;tingui&s;hed as the friend of the whites. This unworthy return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly &s;ignalized him&s;elf in the war which en&s;ued.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="36" REF="026674_0036_0FD15587B2DB8BE8">4. In the autumn of the &s;ame year, a deci&s;ive battle was fought at the mouth of the Great Kanhaway, between the collected forces of the Shawane&s;e, Mingoes, and Delawares, and a detachment of the Virginia militia. The Indians were defeated, and &s;ued for peace.</P>
<P N="5">5. Logan, however, di&s;dained to be &s;een among the &s;up|pliants; but, le&s;t the &s;incerity of a treaty &s;hould be di&s;tru&s;t|ed, from which &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a chief ab&s;ented him&s;elf, he &s;ent by a me&s;&s;enger, the following &s;peech, to be delivered to Lord Dunmore.</P>
<P N="6">6. "I appeal to any white man to &s;ay if ever he enter|ed Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him no meat; if ev|er he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not. Du|ring the la&s;t long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace."</P>
<P N="7">7. "Such was my love for the whites, that my coun|trymen pointed as they pa&s;&s;ed by, and &s;aid, <HI>Logan is the friend of white men.</HI> I had even thought to have lived with you, had it not been for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cre&s;ap, the la&s;t &s;pring, in cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not even &s;paring my women and children."</P>
<P N="8">8. "There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have &s;ought it; I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace; but do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to &s;ave his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one."</P>

<HEAD>THE AGED PRISONER, RELEASED FROM THE BASTILE.</HEAD>
<P>NOWHERE el&s;e on earth, perhaps, has hu|man mi&s;ery, by human means, been rendered &s;o la&s;ting, &s;o complete, or &s;o remedile&s;s as in that de&s;potic pri&s;on, the Ba&s;tile. This the following ca&s;e may &s;uffice to evince; the particulars of which are tran&s;lated from that elegant and energetic writer Mr. Mercier.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="37" REF="026674_0037_0FD15587BAB17788">2. The heinous offence which merited an impri&s;onment &s;urpa&s;&s;ing torture, and rendering death a ble&s;&s;ing, was no more than &s;ome unguarded expre&s;&s;ions, implying di&s;re&s;pect towards the late Gallic monarch, Louis fifteenth.</P>
<P N="3">3. Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Louis &s;ixteenth to the throne, the mini&s;ters then in office, moved by humanity, began their admini&s;tration with an act of clemency and ju&s;tice. They in&s;pected the regi&s;ters of the Ba&s;tile, and &s;et many pri&s;oners at liberty.</P>
<P N="4">4. Among tho&s;e, there was an old man who had groan|ed in confinement for forty &s;even years, between four thick and cold &s;tone-walls. Hardened by adver&s;ity, which &s;trengthens both the mind and con&s;titution, when they are not overpowered by it, he had re&s;i&s;ted the horrors of his long impri&s;onment with an invincible and manly &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="5">5. His locks, white, thin, and &s;cattered, had almo&s;t ac|quired the rigidity of iron; whil&s;t his body, environed for &s;o long a time by a coffin of &s;tone, had borrowed from it a firm and compact habit. The narrow door of his tomb, turning upon its grating hinges, opened not as u&s;ual by halves, and an unknown voice announced his liberty, and bade him depart.</P>
<P N="6">6. Believing this to be a dream, he he&s;itated; but at length ro&s;e up and walked forth with trembling &s;teps, ama|zed at the &s;pace he traver&s;ed. The &s;tairs of the pri&s;on, the halls, the court &s;eemed to him va&s;t, immen&s;e, and almo&s;t without bounds.</P>
<P N="7">7. He &s;topped from time to time, and gazed around like a bewildered traveller. His vi&s;ion was with difficulty reconciled to the clear light of day. He contemplated the heavens as a new object. His eyes remained fixed, and he could not even weep.</P>
<P N="8">8. Stupified with the newly acquired power of changing his po&s;ition, his limbs, like his tongue, refu&s;ed in &s;pite of his efforts, to perform their office. At length he got through the formidable gate.</P>
<P N="9">9. When he felt the motion of the carriage, which was prepared to tran&s;port him to his former habitation, he &s;creamed out, and uttered &s;ome inarticulate &s;ounds; and as he could not bear this new movement, he was obliged to de&s;cend. Supported by a benevolent arm, he &s;ought out
<PB N="38" REF="026674_0038_0FD15589EA4716F0">
the &s;treet where he had formerly re&s;ided; he found it, but no trace of his hou&s;e remained; one of the public edifices occupied the &s;pot where it had &s;tood.</P>
<P N="10">10. He now &s;aw nothing which brought to his recol|lection, either that particular quarter, the city it&s;elf, or the objects with which he was formerly acquainted. The hou&s;es of his neare&s;t neighbors, which were fre&s;h in his memory, had a&s;&s;umed a new appearance.</P>
<P N="11">11. In vain were his looks directed to all the objects around him; he could di&s;cover nothing of which he had the &s;malle&s;t remembrance. Terrified, he &s;topped and fetch|ed a deep &s;igh. To him what did it import, that the city was peopled with living creatures? None of them were alive to him; he was unknown to all the world, and he knew nobody; and whil&s;t he wept, he regretted his dungeon.</P>
<P N="12">12. At the name of the Ba&s;tile, which he often pro|nounced and even claimed as an a&s;ylum, and the &s;ight of his clothes which marked his former age, the croud gathered around him; curio&s;ity, blended with pity, excited their at|tention. The mo&s;t aged a&s;ked him many que&s;tions, but had no remembrance of the circum&s;tances which he recap|itulated.</P>
<P N="13">13. At length accident brought to his way an ancient dome&s;tic, now a &s;uperannuated porter, who, confined to his lodge for fifteen years, had barely &s;ufficient &s;trength to open the gate. Even <HI>he</HI> did not know the ma&s;ter he had &s;erved; but informed him that grief and misfortune had brought his wife to the grave thirty years before; that his children were gone abroad to di&s;tant climes, and that of all his relations and friends, none now remained.</P>
<P N="14">14. This recital was made with the indifference which people di&s;cover for events long pa&s;&s;ed and almo&s;t forgotten. The mi&s;erable man groaned, and groaned alone.

<P N="15">15. Overcome with &s;orrow, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the mini&s;ter, to who&s;e humanity he owed that liberty which was now a burden to him.

friends; and in one word, of a whole generation. Is it po&s;&s;ible in the &s;ame moment to be informed of this univer&s;al de&s;truction, and not to wi&s;h for death?</P>
<P N="16">16. "This general mortality, which to others comes &s;lowly and by degrees, has to me been in&s;tantaneous, the operation of a moment. Whil&s;t &s;ecluded from &s;ociety, I lived with my&s;elf only; but here I can neither live with my&s;elf, nor with this new race, to whom my angui&s;h and de&s;pair appear only as a dream."</P>
<P N="17">17. The mini&s;ter was melted; he cau&s;ed the old dome&s;|tic to attend this unfortunate per&s;on, as only <HI>he</HI> could talk to him of his family.</P>
<P N="18">18. This di&s;cour&s;e was the &s;ingle con&s;olation which he received; for he &s;hunned intercour&s;e with the new race, born &s;ince he had been exiled from the world; and he pa&s;&s;ed his time in the mid&s;t of Paris in the &s;ame &s;olitude as he had done whil&s;t confined in a dungeon for almo&s;t half a century.</P>
<P N="19">19. But the chagrin and mortification of meeting no per&s;on who could &s;ay to him, "We were fomerly known to each other," &s;oon put an end to his exi&s;tence.</P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF COLUMBUS.</HEAD>
<P>TO Chri&s;topher Columbus, a native of Ge|noa, is de&s;ervedly a&s;cribed the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America: an event, which opened to mankind a new region of &s;ci|ence, commerce, and enterprize; and &s;tamped with im|mortality the name of its projector.</P>
<P N="2">2. He was born in the year 1447. He early &s;howed a capacity and inclination for a &s;ea-faring life, and received an education which qualified him to pur&s;ue it. At the age of fourteen, he went to &s;ea, and began his career on that element, where he was to perform exploits, which &s;hould a&s;toni&s;h mankind.</P>
<P N="3">3. He made a variety of voyages to almo&s;t every part of the globe, with which any intercour&s;e was then carried on by &s;ea; and became one of the mo&s;t &s;kilful navigators in Europe. But his active and enterprizing genius would
<PB N="40" REF="026674_0040_0FD1558CE517C9E0">
not &s;uffer him to re&s;t in the deci&s;ions, and tamely follow the track of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was the great object in view at this time in Eu|rope, to find out a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea to the Ea&s;t Indies. The Portugue&s;e, among whom he now re&s;ided, &s;ought a new route to the&s;e de&s;irable regions, by &s;ailing round the &s;outh|ern extremity of Africa.</P>
<P N="5">5. They had con&s;umed half a century in making vari|ous attempts, and had advanced no farther on the we&s;tern &s;hore of Africa than ju&s;t to cro&s;s the equator, when Colum|bus conceived his great de&s;ign of finding India in the we&s;t. The &s;pherical figure of the earth, which he under&s;tood, made it evident to him, that Europe, A&s;ia and Africa formed but a &s;mall proportion of the globe.</P>
<P N="6">6. It was an impeachment of the wi&s;dom and benefi|cence of the Author of nature, to &s;uppo&s;e that the va&s;t &s;pace, yet unexplored, was a wa&s;te, unprofitable ocean; and it ap|peared nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> continent in the we&s;t to counterpoi&s;e the immen&s;e quantity of land, which was known to be in the ea&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. In the &s;ea, near the we&s;tern i&s;lands, pieces of carv|ed wood, and large joints of cane had been di&s;covered; and branches of pine trees and the bodies of two men with features different from the Europeans, had been found on the &s;hores of tho&s;e i&s;lands after a cour&s;e of we&s;terly winds.</P>
<P N="8">8. The&s;e rea&s;onings and facts, with &s;ome others, con|vinced Columbus that it was po&s;&s;ible to find the de&s;ired land by &s;ailing in a we&s;terly direction. He had a genius of that kind, which makes u&s;e of rea&s;oning only as an ex|citement to action. No &s;ooner was he &s;atisfied of the truth of his &s;y&s;tem than he was anxious to bring it to the te&s;t of experiment; and &s;et out on a voyage of di&s;covery.</P>
<P N="9">9. His fir&s;t &s;tep was to &s;ecure the patronage of &s;ome of the con&s;iderable powers of Europe, capable of undertaking &s;uch an enterprize. Excited by the love of his country, he laid his &s;cheme before the Senate of Genoa, offering to &s;ail under their banners. But they, ignorant of the princi|ples on which it was formed, rejected it as the dream of a vi&s;ionary projector.</P>
<P N="10">10. He next applied to John II. king of Portugal. But he, being deeply engaged in pro&s;ecuting di&s;coveries along the
<PB N="41" REF="026674_0041_0FD1558E8A82C7D8">
coa&s;t of Africa, was not inclined to encourage the under|taking of Columbus; yet he meanly &s;ought to rob him of the glory and advantages of his &s;cheme, by privately di&s;|patching a &s;hip to make a di&s;covery in the we&s;t.</P>
<P N="11">11. When Columbus was acquainted with this perfid|ious tran&s;action, he quitted the kingdom with indignation, and landed in Spain in 1484. Here, after &s;even years pain|ful &s;olicitation at court, and &s;urmounting every ob&s;tacle, which ignorance, timidity, jealou&s;y and avarice could lay before him, he obtained his reque&s;t; and Ferdinand and I&s;abella, who then reigned together, agreed to be patrons of his enterprize.</P>
<P N="12">12. It was &s;tipulated between him and them, that he &s;hould be admiral in all tho&s;e i&s;lands and continents he &s;hould di&s;cover, and have the office hereditary in his fami|ly; that he &s;hould be viceroy of the &s;ame for life, and en|joy a tenth of all the merchandize which &s;hould be found.</P>
<P N="13">13. Three &s;mall ve&s;&s;els were fitted out and victualled for twelve months, furni&s;hed with ninety men, and placed un|der his command. With this little fleet he &s;et &s;ail from Palos on Friday the 3d of Augu&s;t, 1492; and taking a we&s;terly cour&s;e, boldly ventured into the unknown ocean.</P>
<P N="14">14. He &s;oon found that he had unfore&s;een hard&s;hips and difficulties to encounter from the inexperience and fears of his men. To go directly from home into a boundle&s;s ocean, far from any hope of relief, if any accident &s;hould befal them, and where no friendly port nor human being were known to exi&s;t, filled the bolde&s;t &s;eamen with appre|hen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="15">15. What greatly added to their terror, was a new and extraordinary phenomenon, which occurred on the 14th of September. The magnetic needle varied from the pole, and as they advanced, the variation increa&s;ed. Nature &s;eemed to be changed; and their only guide through the trackle&s;s waters, to prove unfaithful.</P>
<P N="16">16. After twenty days, the impatient &s;ailors began to talk of throwing their commander into the &s;ea, and of re|turning home. Their murmurs reached his ears; but his fertile mind &s;ugge&s;ted an expedient in every extremity. By &s;oothing, flattery, and artifice; by inventing rea&s;ons for
<PB N="42" REF="026674_0042_0FD1558FD95FD980">
every uncommon appearance, and deceiving them in the &s;hip's reckoning, he kept them on &s;ixteen days longer.</P>
<P N="17">17. On the night of the 11th of October, he him&s;elf di&s;covered a light, which appeared to move, and the next morning gave them the joyful &s;ight of land. It proved to be the i&s;land Guanahana, one of the clu&s;ter, called Baha|mas. Thus, in the &s;pace of thirty &s;ix days, and the forty fifth year of his age, Columbus completed a voyage, which he had &s;pent twenty years in projecting; which opened to the Europeans a new world, and made the name of Co|lumbus immortal.</P>
<P N="18">18. With tears of joy and tran&s;ports of congratulation, the crews of the &s;hips &s;ang a hymn of thank&s;giving to God. After touching at &s;everal i&s;lands, and leaving a &s;mall colony, he returned to Spain. On his return he was overtaken by a &s;torm, which became &s;o furious that his de&s;truction &s;eem|ed inevitable. The crews abandoned them&s;elves to de&s;pair, and expected every moment to be &s;wallowed up in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aves.</P>
<P N="19">19. In this extremity, he gave an admirable proof of his calmne&s;s and fore&s;ight. He wrote a &s;hort account of his voyage on parchment, inclo&s;ed it in a cake of wax, which he put into a tight ca&s;k, and threw into the &s;ea, in hopes that &s;ome fortunate accident would pre&s;erve a depo&s;it of &s;o much importance to the world. The &s;torm however &s;ub|&s;ided, and he arrived at Palos in Spain on the 15th of March, 1493.</P>
<P N="20">20. The populace received him with acclamations, and the King and Queen, no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed than delighted with his &s;ucce&s;s, had him conducted to court with a pomp &s;uita|ble to the event, which added &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre to their reign. His family was ennobled; and his former privileges and offices confirmed to him.</P>
<P N="21">21. He &s;oon &s;ailed on a &s;econd expedition to the new world, with a fleet of &s;eventeen &s;hips, having on board 1500 people, and all things nece&s;&s;ary for e&s;tabli&s;hing plantations. After di&s;covering many i&s;lands of the We&s;t Indies, and &s;ub|mitting to every labor and vexation in attempting to &s;ettle his colony, he returned to Spain in 1498, to counteract the intrigues and efforts of his enemies in the Spani&s;h court.</P>
<P N="22">22. He made two more voyages, in which he touched at mo&s;t parts of the We&s;t Indies, di&s;covered the continent,
<PB N="43" REF="026674_0043_0FD155942EF75C78">
and coa&s;ted on its &s;hores for 400 leagues. But the la&s;t part of his life was made wretched by the per&s;ecutions of his enemies.</P>
<P N="23">23. Their pride and jealou&s;y could not endure that a foreigner &s;hould attain &s;o high a rank as to be viceroy for life, and have the office of admiral hereditary in his family, to the exclu&s;ion of the Spani&s;h nobles. They were, there|fore, indefatigable in their endeavors to depreciate his merits, and ruin his fortune.</P>
<P N="24">24. He was once carried home in irons; and in viola|tion of gratitude, humanity, and ju&s;tice, ba&s;ely deprived of all the offices and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the new world, to which he had a right by the &s;olemn &s;tipulations of Ferdinand. When he returned from his la&s;t voyage in 1505, Queen I&s;abella, his only friend and patrone&s;s in the court of Spain, was dead.</P>
<P N="25">25. Worn out with &s;ickne&s;s and fatigue, di&s;gu&s;ted with the in&s;incerity of his Sovereign and the haughtine&s;s of his courtiers, he lingered out a year in fruitle&s;s &s;olicitations for his violated rights, till death relieved him from his &s;orrows. He ended his u&s;eful and active life at Valladolid on the 10th of May, 1506, in the 59th year of his age.</P>
<P N="26">26. In the life of this remarkable man, there was no deficiency of any quality, which can con&s;titute a great char|acter. He was grave, though courteous in his deportment, circum&s;pect in his words and actions, irreproachable in his morals, and exemplary in all the duties of religion.</P>
<P N="27">27. The court of Spain were &s;o ju&s;t to his memory, that, notwith&s;tanding their ingratitude towards him during his life, they buried him magnificently in the Cathedral of Seville, and erected a tomb over him with this in&s;cription,

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF BABYLON.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t foundation of Babylon, is, by &s;ome authors, a&s;cribed to Semiramis, and by others to Belus. Who the founder was, is not &s;o material; but it is certain that Nebuchadnezzar was the per&s;on who rai&s;ed it to &s;uch a pinnacle of glory, as that it became one of the principal wonders of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. The walls of this city were 60 miles in circumfer|ence, 350 feet high, and 87 feet thick. The city was ex|actly &s;quare, mea&s;uring 15 miles upon every &s;ide. The walls were built with large bricks, cemented together with a kind of glutinous &s;lime, &s;uperior to any lime, and which grows harder than the bricks them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="3">3. They were encompa&s;&s;ed by a va&s;t ditch lined with bricks, cemented with the &s;ame kind of bitumen, and filled with water. The earth which was dug from the ditch &s;erved to make the bricks for the walls: it mu&s;t, therefore, have been of great depth and width.</P>
<P N="4">4. On every &s;ide of the city were 25 brazen gates, exact|ly oppo&s;ite to each other. Between every two of the&s;e gates were three towers, and four more at the angles, and three between each of the angles and the next gate on every &s;ide.</P>
<P N="5">5. The towers were all ten feet higher than the walls. Streets inter&s;ected each other at right angles from all the gates on every &s;ide, being 15 miles in length, and 50 in number. Thus was the city cut into 676 &s;quares.</P>
<P N="6">6. The hanging gardens were a great curio&s;ity. They contained a &s;quare of 400 feet, and were carried to the height of the wall of the city by &s;everal large terraces. This va&s;t pile was &s;u&s;tained by arches built upon arches, and &s;trengthened by a wall 22 feet thick on every &s;ide.</P>
<P N="7">7. The&s;e gardens contained all kinds of flowers and plants, and even large trees. On the upper terrace was an aqueduct, which &s;erved to water the whole.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="46" REF="026674_0046_0FD15599E0982590">8. The Tigris, a branch of the river Euphrates, ran through the city from north to &s;outh. After Cyrus had be&s;ieged the city two years, he found means to turn the cour&s;e of this river, and marched his army under the walls through its channel. This was done on the night in which Bel&s;hazzar and his nobles were revelling at the banquet; who were all &s;lain, and the city taken.</P>

<HEAD>THE SAILOR AND THE MONKIES.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS no animal, below the human &s;pecies, re&s;embles man more in the imitative faculty than the monkey. It is &s;aid that a &s;ailor, having a number of red woollen caps to di&s;po&s;e of, went on &s;hore in South America to trade with the natives.</P>
<P N="2">2. In his way to a &s;ettlement, lying through a wood very thickly inhabited by monkies, it being in the heat of the day, he put a cap on his head, and laying the others by his &s;ide, determined to take a little repo&s;e under the &s;hade of a large tree.</P>
<P N="3">3. To his utter a&s;toni&s;hment, when he awoke, from the &s;pecimen he had given his imitative ob&s;ervers of the u&s;e of his caps, he beheld a number of them upon the heads of the monkies in the trees round about him; while the wearers were chattering in the mo&s;t unu&s;ual manner.</P>
<P N="4">4. Finding every attempt to regain his caps fruitle&s;s, he at length in a fit of rage and di&s;appointment, and under the &s;uppo&s;ition that the one he retained on his head was not worth taking away, pulled it off, and throwing it upon the ground, exclaimed, "Here, you little thieving rogues, if you will keep the re&s;t, you are welcome to this al&s;o."</P>
<P N="5">5. He had no &s;ooner done this, than, to his great &s;ur|pri&s;e, the little ob&s;erving animals very readily imitated him.

<P>WHEN the great Conde commanded the Spani&s;h army, and laid &s;iege to one of the French towns in Flanders, a &s;oldier being ill treated by a general officer, and &s;truck &s;everal times with a cane, for &s;ome di&s;re&s;pectful words he had let fall, an&s;wered very coolly, that he &s;hould &s;oon make him repent of it.</P>

<P N="7">7. Let infant choirs, compo&s;ed of male and female voices, join in prai&s;e of our political fathers, and all patrons of &s;cience. They have, doubtle&s;s, reflected on the va&s;t im|portance of <HI>female</HI> education to a ri&s;ing country.</P>
<P N="8">8. They have con&s;idered how much the &s;ons and daugh|ters of every age, are indebted to their <HI>mothers</HI> for the &s;eeds of virtue and knowledge; that &s;chools and colleges can but cultivate and mature the plants, which owe their origin to the &s;eeds &s;own in infancy; that from <HI>maternal</HI> lips, our fir&s;t accents are formed; and, that from <HI>them,</HI> our words, our actions, nay, our every thought proceeds.</P>
<P N="9">9. What an argument this, that <HI>they</HI> &s;hould well be taught, from whom our virtues <HI>are,</HI> and from whom our vices <HI>may</HI> be derived! And may we not indulge an hone&s;t pride, that this metropolis has been one of the foremo&s;t in exertions to promote female improvement?</P>
<P N="10">10. While the <HI>&s;ons</HI> of our citizens are cultivating their minds, and preparing them for the arduous, important, and manly employments, which America offers to the indu&s;trious,
<PB N="49" REF="026674_0049_0FD1559ECCC69D58">
their <HI>daughters</HI> are gaining that knowledge, which will en|able them to become amiable &s;i&s;ters, virtuous children; and, in the event, to a&s;&s;ume characters, more intere&s;ting to the public, and more endearing to them&s;elves than both.</P>
<P N="11">11. How tran&s;porting are the pro&s;pects of America! With what ju&s;tice can it challenge the reality of that pro|phetic eulogy? "Ble&s;&s;ed is that nation, who&s;e &s;ons and daughters are trained to virtue, honor, and u&s;efulne&s;s; who&s;e &s;chools are as broad rivers and &s;treams. Yea, ble&s;&s;ed is that people, who&s;e daughters wear the robes of innocence, and who&s;e young <HI>Eli&s;has</HI> ri&s;e up in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and wear with dignity the mantles of their departed <HI>Elijahs.</HI>"</P>
<P N="12">12. If parents wi&s;h to guard their children again&s;t an un|due attention to external ornaments, again&s;t extravagance in dre&s;s and gaudy equipage, what better expedient will they find, than to repleni&s;h their minds with &s;uch a fund of u&s;eful knowledge, as &s;hall enable them &s;uitably to contemn all worthle&s;s things; to di&s;cern where real merit lies, and what con&s;titutes the dignity of their &s;ex?</P>
<P N="13">13. Then they will not ea&s;ily be captivated with glitter|ing trappings, trifling toys, and ta&s;tele&s;s amu&s;ements; but ex|tend their views to more noble objects. What greater bar|rier again&s;t vice of every kind than u&s;eful knowledge?</P>
<P N="14">14. Is it not a melancholy truth, that <HI>man</HI> too often pro&s;titutes his boa&s;ted faculties to the de&s;truction of female happine&s;s? How nece&s;&s;ary then, to fortify their minds again&s;t the attacks of &s;uch vile &s;educers? Blemi&s;hes in fe|male characters &s;eldom are effaced. Not &s;o with man. He tarni&s;hes his name, and brightens it again.</P>
<P N="15">15. But if woman chance to &s;werve from the &s;tricte&s;t rules of virtue,

<P N="19">19. With &s;uch &s;ingular advantages, we need but the active mind, the hone&s;t heart, and the diligent hand. Thus &s;hall our &s;chools become as pure, enriching &s;treams; our churches flouri&s;h as the palm tree, and our land become as the garden of God.</P>

<P N="24">24. There was a time, in the infancy of our country, when le&s;s attention was paid to the early improvement of the mind. When the advantage of &s;chooling was limited to a few, and tho&s;e principally of one &s;ex; while the other was devoted to dome&s;tic toils.</P>

That I made him my pri&s;oner in his own capital; and, after he had been depo&s;ed and &s;lain by his &s;ubjects, vanqui&s;hed and took Guatemozin, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and accompli&s;hed my conque&s;t of the whole Mexican empire, which I loyally annexed to the Spani&s;h crown?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know very well that thou wa&s;t as fierce as a lion, and as &s;ubtle as a &s;erpent. The prince of darkne&s;s may, perhaps, place thee as high upon his black li&s;t of heroes as Alexander or Cae&s;ar. It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to interfere with him in &s;ettling thy rank.

<SPEAKER>Penn.</SPEAKER>
<P>An hone&s;t right of fair purcha&s;e. We gave the native Indians a variety of articles which they wanted; and they, in return, gave us lands which they did not want. All was amicably agreed on; and not a drop of blood &s;hed to &s;tain our acqui&s;ition.</P>

<P>Alas, I was not pre&s;ent when that direful act was done! Had I been there, the mildne&s;s of my nature never would have &s;uffered me to endure the &s;ight. I certainly &s;hould have forbidden it.</P>

<P>Thou wa&s;t the captain of that band of robbers, who did this horrid deed.

<P>The <HI>righteous</HI> I find can <HI>rail,</HI> William Penn. But how do you hope to pre&s;erve this admirable colony you have &s;ettled? Your people, you tell me, live like innocent lambs.

Did Solon, think you, give laws to a people, and leave tho&s;e laws and that people to the mercy of every invader? The fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of a legi&s;lature is to provide a military &s;trength which may defend the whole &s;y&s;tem. The world, William Penn, is a land of robbers.

<HEAD>THE WHISTLE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was a child, at &s;even years old, &s;ays Dr. Franklin, my friends on a holiday filled my little pockets with coppers. I went directly to a &s;hop where they &s;old toys for children; and being charmed with the &s;ound of a Whi&s;tle, which I met by the way, in the hands of an|other boy, I voluntarily offered, and gave all my money for one.</P>
<P N="2">2. I then came home, and went whi&s;tling all over the hou&s;e, much plea&s;ed with my Whi&s;tle; but di&s;turbing all the family. My brothers and &s;i&s;ters, and cou&s;ins, under|&s;tanding the bargain I had made, told me, I had given four times as much for it, as it was worth.</P>
<P N="3">3. This put me in mind of what good things I might have bought with the re&s;t of the money. And they laughed at me &s;o much for my folly, that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the Whi&s;tle gave me plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="4">4. This, however, was afterwards of u&s;e to me; the impre&s;&s;ion continuing on my mind, &s;o that often when I was tempted to buy &s;ome unnece&s;&s;ary thing, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, <HI>Don't give too much for the Whi&s;tle.</HI> And &s;o I &s;aved my money.</P>

<HEAD>TRUE PATRIOTISM, DISPLAYED AT THE SIEGE OF CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>IN 1347, the town of Calais in France was be&s;ieged by Edward III. of England, and reduced to the la&s;t extremity by famine and the fatigue of the inhabitants. John of Vienna, the governor, fore&s;eeing the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;urrendering his fortre&s;s, appeared upon the walls and de|&s;ired a parley.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sir Walter Manny was &s;ent to him by Edward, whom the governor addre&s;&s;ed in the following words. "I have been entru&s;ted by my &s;overeign with the command of this town. It is almo&s;t a year &s;ince you be&s;ieged me; and I have endeavored, as well as tho&s;e under me, to do my
<PB N="57" REF="026674_0057_0FD155AD4BF6C650">
duty. But you are acquainted with our pre&s;ent condition. We are peri&s;hing with hunger, and have no hopes of relief. I am willing, therefore, to &s;urrender; and de&s;ire, as the &s;ole condition, that you would en&s;ure the lives and liberties of the&s;e brave men, who have &s;o long &s;hared with me every danger and fatigue."</P>
<P N="3">3. Manny replied, that the king was &s;o incen&s;ed again&s;t the town&s;men of Calais for their ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, he was determined to take exemplary vengeance on them; and would receive no terms which &s;hould re&s;train him in the puni&s;hment of the offenders.</P>
<P N="4">4. "Con&s;ider," replied the governor, "that this is not the treatment to which brave men are entitled. If any Engli&s;h knight had been in my &s;ituation, your king would have expected the &s;ame conduct from him. The inhabit|ants of Calais have done for their &s;overeign what merits the e&s;teem of every prince; much more, of &s;o gallant a prince as Edward.</P>
<P N="5">5. But I inform you, that, if we mu&s;t peri&s;h, we &s;hall not peri&s;h unrevenged; and that we are not yet &s;o reduced, but we can &s;ell our lives at a high price to the victors. It is the intere&s;t of both &s;ides to prevent the&s;e de&s;perate ex|tremities; and I expect that you your&s;elf, brave knight, will interpo&s;e your good offices with your prince in our be|half."</P>

<P>GOD came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heav|ens, and the earth was full of his prai&s;e. And his bright|ne&s;s was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand; and there was the hiding of his power.</P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTE OF MONTESQUIEU.</HEAD>
<P>A GENTLEMAN, being at Mar&s;eilles, hired a boat, with an intention of &s;ailing for plea&s;ure. He entered into conver&s;ation with the two young men who owned the ve&s;&s;el, and learned, that they were not water|men by trade, but &s;ilver-&s;miths; and that when they could be &s;pared from their u&s;ual bu&s;ine&s;s, they employed them|&s;elves in that way to increa&s;e their earnings.</P>
<P N="2">2. On expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urpri&s;e at their conduct, and im|puting it to an avaricious di&s;po&s;ition; Oh! &s;ir, &s;aid the young men, if you knew our rea&s;ons, you would a&s;cribe it to a better motive.</P>
<P N="3">3. Our father, anxious to a&s;&s;i&s;t his family, &s;craped to|gether all he was worth; purcha&s;ed a ve&s;&s;el for the pur|po&s;e of trading to the coa&s;t of Barbary; but was unfortu|nately taken by a pirate, carried to Tripoli, and &s;old for a &s;lave.</P>
<P N="4">4. He writes word, that he is luckily fallen into the hands of a ma&s;ter who treats him with great humanity; but that the &s;um which is demanded for his ran&s;om is &s;o exorbitant that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for him ever to rai&s;e it. He adds that we mu&s;t, therefore, relinqui&s;h all hope of ever &s;eeing him again, and be contented that he has as many comforts as his &s;ituation will admit.</P>
<P N="5">5. With the hopes of re&s;toring to his family a beloved father, we are &s;triving, by every hone&s;t mean in our power,
<PB N="61" REF="026674_0061_0FD155B3D99BB5B8">
to collect the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary for his ran&s;om; and we are not a&s;hamed to employ our&s;elves in the occupation of wa|termen. The gentleman was &s;truck with this account, and on his departure, made them a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="6">6. Some months afterwards, the young men being at work in their &s;hop, were greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;udden ar|rival of their father, who threw him&s;elf into their arms; exclaiming, at the &s;ame time, that he was fearful they had taken &s;ome unju&s;t method to rai&s;e the money for his ran|&s;om, for it was too great a &s;um for them to have gained by their ordinary occupation.</P>
<P N="7">7. They profe&s;&s;ed their ignorance of the whole affair, and could only &s;u&s;pect they owed their father's relea&s;e to that &s;tranger, to who&s;e genero&s;ity they had been before &s;o much obliged. After Monte&s;quieu's death, an account of this affair was found among his papers, and the &s;um actu|ally remitted to Tripoli for the old man's ran&s;om.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is a plea&s;ure to hear of &s;uch an act of benevolence performed even by a per&s;on totally unknown to us; but the plea&s;ure is greatly increa&s;ed, when it proves the union of virtue and talents in an author &s;o renowned as Monte&s;quieu.</P>

<HEAD>THE BENEVOLENT PAIR.</HEAD>
<P>A POOR man and his wife at Vienna, who had &s;ix &s;mall children, finding them&s;elves unable to &s;up|port them all, were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of turning the younge&s;t upon the public. The hu&s;band carried it reluc|tantly to the foundling ho&s;pital, depo&s;ited it in the ba&s;ket which was placed near the gate for the reception of the foundlings, and anxiou&s;ly waited till the arrival of the in|&s;pector, that he might take a farewel view of his child.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the in&s;pector came at the u&s;ual time to ex|amine the ba&s;ket, he perceived <HI>two</HI> children therein; ob|&s;erving the laborer who &s;tood at a &s;mall di&s;tance, he &s;up|po&s;ed that he had brought them both; and compelled the poor man, notwith&s;tanding all his prote&s;tations to the con|trary, to return with two children in&s;tead of one, which was already more than he knew how to maintain.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="62" REF="026674_0062_0FD155B859DDCBB0">3. His wife, as well as him&s;elf, was exceedingly de|jected at this increa&s;e of their expen&s;es; but, unwilling to expo&s;e the little &s;tranger in the &s;treet, they determined to u&s;e all their endeavors to &s;upport them&s;elves and the &s;even children, and they hoped Providence would a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P N="4">4. On undre&s;&s;ing the child, the woman found a paper &s;owed to its clothes, containing an order upon a banker for five crowns a month, to be paid to the per&s;on who took care of it. The good people were not a little rejoiced at their happy fortune.</P>
<P N="5">5. But the &s;tory being circulated, and coming to the knowledge of the managers of the ho&s;pital, they claimed the child as their property. The laborer refu&s;ed to relin|qui&s;h it, and was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P N="6">6. The cau&s;e being tried in a court of ju&s;tice, it was decreed, that, as the foundling ho&s;pital had at fir&s;t declined receiving the child, it of right belonged to the poor man who had &s;hown &s;uch humanity in keeping it, when he was &s;o ill able to afford any additional expen&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>THE UNFORTUNATE PHILANTHROPIST.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1775, a &s;hip lying at anchor in Table-Bay at the Cape of Good Hope, was driven on &s;hore in a violent &s;torm, and the crew reduced to the ut|mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and danger. Their cries for a&s;&s;i&s;tance were di&s;tinctly heard by the inhabitants; but at fir&s;t there ap|peared no pro&s;pect of relief from any quarter.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;well of the &s;ea, which broke over the &s;hip with the greate&s;t violence, made it impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;ave them&s;elves in boats, and highly dangerous to attempt it by &s;wimming. Some of tho&s;e, who ventured to &s;wim to the &s;hore, were thrown again&s;t the rocks and da&s;hed to pieces; others, as &s;oon as they had arrived at the &s;hore, were car|ried back by another wave and drowned.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Dutchman by the name of VOLTEMAD, who happened to be a &s;pectator of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cene, was touched with compa&s;&s;ion of &s;o noble a kind, and at the &s;ame time &s;o operative, that, mounting a high &s;pirited hor&s;e,
<PB N="63" REF="026674_0063_0FD155BA4D39D570">
he &s;wam him over to the &s;hip; encouraged &s;ome of the crew to lay hold of the end of a rope, which he threw out to them for that purpo&s;e, and others to fa&s;ten them&s;elves to the hor&s;e's tail; then turned about, and carried them &s;afe on &s;hore.</P>
<P N="4">4. This animal's natural aptne&s;s for &s;wimming, the great &s;ize of his body, the firmne&s;s and &s;trength of his limbs, prevented him from being ea&s;ily overpowered by the &s;well of the &s;ea. But, unfortunately, this generous and active veteran him&s;elf became a victim to death.</P>
<P N="5">5. Fourteen young per&s;ons he had actually &s;aved; and while endeavoring to pre&s;erve more than it was po&s;&s;ible for him to do in &s;o &s;hort a time, he and his hor&s;e were both drowned. The occa&s;ion of this was as follows.</P>
<P N="6">6. After the &s;eventh turn, having &s;taid a little longer than u&s;ual to re&s;t him&s;elf, the poor wretches on board were afraid that he did not intend to return; for this rea&s;on, being impatient, they redoubled their prayers and cries for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; upon which, his tendere&s;t feelings being wrought upon, he again ha&s;tened to their relief ere his hor&s;e was &s;ufficiently re&s;ted.</P>
<P N="7">7. The poor animal, almo&s;t &s;pent, now &s;unk the &s;ooner under his burden, ina&s;much as too many &s;ought to be &s;aved at one time; and one of them, as it was thought, happened unluckily to catch hold of the hor&s;e's bridle, and by that mean drew his head under water.</P>
<P N="8">8. This bold and enterprizing philanthropi&s;t commands our e&s;teem and admiration the more, as he had put him&s;elf into this danger for the relief of others, without him&s;elf being able to &s;wim. The Dutch Ea&s;t India company cau&s;ed a monument to be erected to the memory of this unfortunate philanthropi&s;t.</P>

<P>I THINK my&s;elf happy, king Agrippa, be|cau&s;e I &s;hall an&s;wer for my&s;elf this day before thee, touch|ing all the things whereof I am accu&s;ed of the Jews;
<PB N="64" REF="026674_0064_0FD155BC1D996480">
e&s;pecially, as I know thee to be expert in all cu&s;toms and que&s;tions which are among the Jews. Wherefore I be|&s;eech thee to hear me patiently.</P>
<P N="2">2. My manner of life from my youth, which was at the fir&s;t among my own nation at Jeru&s;alem, know all the Jews; who knew me from the beginning, if they would te&s;tify, that, after the &s;traite&s;t &s;ect of our religion, I lived a Phari&s;ee.</P>
<P N="3">3. And now I &s;tand and am judged for the hope of the promi&s;e made of God unto our fathers. Unto which prom|i&s;e, our twelve tribes, in&s;tantly &s;erving God day and night, hope to come; for which hope's &s;ake, king Agrippa, I am accu&s;ed of the Jews.</P>
<P N="4">4. Why &s;hould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God &s;hould rai&s;e the dead? I verily thought with my&s;elf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Je&s;us of Nazareth.</P>
<P N="5">5. Which thing I al&s;o did in Jeru&s;alem; and many of the &s;aints did I &s;hut up in pri&s;on, having received authority from the chief prie&s;ts. And when they were put to death, I gave my voice again&s;t them. And I puni&s;hed them oft in every &s;ynagogue, and compelled them to bla&s;pheme. And being exceedingly mad again&s;t them, I per&s;ecuted them even unto &s;trange cities.</P>
<P N="6">6. Whereupon, as I went to Dama&s;cus with authority and commi&s;&s;ion from the chief prie&s;ts, at mid day, O king, I &s;aw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightne&s;s of the &s;un, &s;hining round about me, and them who journey|ed with me.</P>
<P N="7">7. And, when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice &s;peaking unto me, and &s;aying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me? It is hard for thee to kick again&s;t the pricks. And I &s;aid, Who art thou Lord? And he &s;aid, I am Je&s;us whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t.</P>
<P N="8">8. But ri&s;e, and &s;tand upon thy feet; for I have ap|peared unto thee for this purpo&s;e, to make thee a mini&s;ter and a witne&s;s, both of the&s;e things which thou ha&s;t &s;een, and of tho&s;e things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, un|to whom I now &s;end thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan

unto God; that they may receive forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and inheritance among them who are &s;anctified by faith which is in me.</P>
<P N="9">9. Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not di&s;obedient unto the heavenly vi&s;ion; but &s;howed fir&s;t unto them of Dama&s;cus, and at Jeru&s;alem, and throughout all the coa&s;ts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they &s;hould repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. For the&s;e cau&s;es, the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.</P>
<P N="10">10. Having, therefore, obtained help from God, I con|tinue unto this day, witne&s;&s;ing both to &s;mall and great; &s;aying no other things than tho&s;e which Mo&s;es and the prophets did &s;ay &s;hould come; that Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;uffer, and that he &s;hould be the fir&s;t who &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead, and &s;hould &s;how light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</P>

<HEAD>CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>MONTAIGNE thinks it &s;ome reflection upon human nature it&s;elf, that few people take delight in &s;eeing bea&s;ts care&s;s or play together; but almo&s;t every one is plea&s;ed to &s;ee them lacerate and worry one another.</P>
<P N="2">2. I am &s;orry this temper is become almo&s;t a di&s;tin|gui&s;hing character of our own nation, from the ob&s;ervation which is made by foreigners of our beloved pa&s;times, bear-baiting, cock-fighting, and the like.</P>
<P N="3">3. We &s;hould find it hard to vindicate the de&s;troying of any thing that has life, merely out of wantonne&s;s; yet in this principle our children are bred up; and one of the fir&s;t plea&s;ures we allow them, is the licen&s;e of inflicting pain up|on poor animals.</P>
<P N="4">4. Almo&s;t as &s;oon as we are &s;en&s;ible what life is our|&s;elves, we make it our &s;port to take it from other creatures. I cannot but believe a very good u&s;e might be made of the fancy which children have for birds and in&s;ects.</P>
<P N="5">5. Mr. Locke takes notice of a mother who often procu|red the&s;e animals for her children, but rewarded or puni&s;hed
<PB N="66" REF="026674_0066_0FD155BE5DC01E90">
them as they treated them well or ill. This was no other than entering them betimes into a daily exerci&s;e of human|ity, and improving their very diver&s;ion to a virtue.</P>
<P N="6">6. The laws of &s;elf-defence undoubtedly ju&s;tify us in de&s;troying tho&s;e animals which would de&s;troy us, which in|jure our properties, or annoy our per&s;ons; but not even the&s;e, whenever their &s;ituation incapacitates them from hurt|ing us.</P>
<P N="7">7. I know of no right which we have to &s;hoot a bear on an inacce&s;&s;ible i&s;land of ice; or an eagle on the moun|tain's top; who&s;e lives cannot injure, nor deaths procure us any benefit. We are unable to give life, and therefore ought not wantonly to take it away from the meane&s;t in&s;ect, without &s;ufficient rea&s;on. They all receive it from the &s;ame benevolent hand as our&s;elves, and have therefore an equal right to enjoy it.</P>
<P N="8">8. God has been plea&s;ed to create numberle&s;s animals intended for our &s;u&s;tenance; and that they are &s;o intended, the agreeable flavor of their fle&s;h to our palates, and the whole&s;ome nutriment which it admini&s;ters to our &s;tomachs, are &s;ufficient proofs.</P>
<P N="9">9. The&s;e, as they are formed for our u&s;e, propagated by our culture, and fed by our care, we have certainly a right to deprive of life, becau&s;e it is given and pre&s;erved to them on that condition.</P>
<P N="10">10. But this &s;hould always be performed with all the tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion which &s;o di&s;agreeable an office will permit; and no circum&s;tances ought to be omitted, which can render their executions as quick and ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>THE Athenians, having made war upon the Syracu&s;ians, the army of the former, under the com|mand of Nicias and Demo&s;thenes, was totally defeated; and the generals obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.

<P N="2"><PB N="67" REF="026674_0067_0FD155BFDAF3CF90">2. Diocles, one of the leaders of the greate&s;t authority among the people, propo&s;ed, that all the Athenians who were born of free parents, and all &s;uch Sicilians as had join|ed with them, &s;hould be impri&s;oned, and be maintained on bread and water only; that the &s;laves, and all the Atticks, &s;hould be publickly &s;old; and that the two Athenian gen|erals &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;courged with rods, and then put to death.</P>
<P N="3">3. This la&s;t article exceedingly di&s;gu&s;ted all wi&s;e and compa&s;&s;ionate Syracu&s;ians.

<P N="4">4. At that in&s;tant, Nicolaus, a man venerable for his great age and gravity, who in this war had lo&s;t two &s;ons, the only heirs to his name and e&s;tate, made his &s;ervants carry him to the tribunal for harangues; and the in&s;tant he appeared, a profound &s;ilence en&s;ued, when he addre&s;&s;ed them in the following manner.</P>
<P N="5">5. "You here behold an unfortunate father, who has felt more than any other Syracu&s;ian the fatal effects of this war, by the death of two &s;ons, who formed all the con&s;o|lation, and were the only &s;upports of my old age.</P>
<P N="6">6.

<P N="7">7.

<HEAD>INTEGRITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Spani&s;h hi&s;torians relate a memorable in&s;tance of honor and regard to truth. A Spani&s;h cavalier in a &s;udden quarrel &s;lew a Moori&s;h gentleman, and fled. His pur&s;uers &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of him; for he had, unperceiv|ed, thrown him&s;elf over a garden wall.</P>
<P N="2">2. The owner, a Moor, happening to be in his garden, was addre&s;&s;ed by the Spaniard on his knees, who acquaint|ed him with his ca&s;e, and implored concealment. Eat this, &s;aid the Moor, giving him half a peach; you now know that you may confide in my protection.</P>
<P N="3">3. He then locked him up in his garden apartments, telling him as &s;oon as it was night, he would provide for his
<PB N="69" REF="026674_0069_0FD155C3171F1910">
e&s;cape to a place of greater &s;afety. The Moor then went into his hou&s;e, where he had but ju&s;t &s;eated him&s;elf, when a great crowd, with loud lamentations, came to his gate, bring|ing the corp&s;e of his &s;on, who had ju&s;t been killed by a Spaniard.</P>
<P N="4">4. When the fir&s;t &s;hock of &s;urpri&s;e was a little over, he learned from the de&s;cription given, that the fatal deed was done by the very per&s;on then in his power. He mentioned this to no one; but, as &s;oon as it was dark, retired to his garden, as if to grieve alone, giving orders that none &s;hould follow him.</P>
<P N="5">5. Then acco&s;ting the Spaniard, he &s;aid, Chri&s;tian, the per&s;on you have killed is my &s;on; his body is now in my hou&s;e. You ought to &s;uffer; but you have eaten with me, and I have given you my faith, which mu&s;t not be broken.</P>
<P N="6">6. He then led the a&s;toni&s;hed Spaniard to his &s;tables, and mounted him on one of his fleete&s;t hor&s;es, and &s;aid, Fly far, while the night can cover you; you will be &s;afe in the morning. You are indeed guilty of my &s;on's blood; but God is ju&s;t and good, and I thank Him I am innocent of yours, and that my faith given is pre&s;erved.</P>
<P N="7">7. This point of honor is mo&s;t religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved by the Arabs and Saracens, from whom it was adopted by the Moors of Africa, and by them was brought into Spain; the effects of which remain to this day; &s;o that when there is any fear of a war's breaking out between England and Spain, an Engli&s;h merchant there, who apprehends the con|fi&s;cation of his goods as tho&s;e of an enemy, thinks them &s;afe if he can get a Spaniard to take charge of them.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Spaniard &s;ecures them as his own, and faithful|ly re-delivers them, or pays the value, whenever the Eng|li&s;hman demands them. One in&s;tance of Spani&s;h honor cannot but &s;till be fre&s;h in the memory of many now liv|ing; and de&s;erves to be handed down to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P N="9">9. In the year 1746, when the Engli&s;h were at open war with Spain, the Elizabeth of London, captain William Ed|wards, coming through the gulph from Jamaica, richly la|den, met with a mo&s;t violent &s;torm, in which the &s;hip &s;prung a leak, that obliged them, for the &s;aving of their lives, to run into the Havannah, a Spani&s;h port.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="70" REF="026674_0070_0FD155C65B2A73D8">10. The captain went on &s;hore, and directly waited on the governor, told the occa&s;ion of his putting in, and that he &s;urrendered the &s;hip as a prize, and him&s;elf and his men as pri&s;oners of war, only reque&s;ting good quarter.</P>
<P N="11">11. No, Sir, replied the Spani&s;h governor, if we had taken you in fair war at &s;ea, or approaching our coa&s;t with ho&s;tile intentions, your &s;hip would then have been a prize, and your people pri&s;oners; but when, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by a tem|pe&s;t, you come into our ports for the &s;afety of your lives, we the enemies, being men, are bound as &s;uch by the laws of humanity to afford relief to di&s;tre&s;&s;ed men who a&s;k it of us.</P>
<P N="12">12. We cannot, even again&s;t our enemies, take advan|tage of an act of God. You have leave therefore to unload your &s;hip, if that be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top the leak; you may refit her here, and traffic &s;o far as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to pay the charges; you may then depart, and I will give you a pa&s;s to be in force till you are beyond Bermuda.</P>
<P N="13">13. If after that you are taken, you will then be a law|ful prize; but now you are only a &s;tranger, and have a &s;tranger's right to &s;afety and protection. The &s;hip accord|ingly departed, and arrived &s;afe in London.</P>

<HEAD>ADVICE TO A YOUNG TRADESMAN.</HEAD>
<P>REMEMBER that time is money. He who can earn ten &s;hillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or &s;its idle one half of that day, though he &s;pend but &s;ixpence during his diver&s;ion or idlene&s;s, ought not to reckon <HI>that</HI> the only expen&s;e; he has really &s;pent, or rather thrown away, five &s;hillings be&s;ides.</P>
<P N="2">2. Remember that credit is money. If a man lets his money lie in my hands after it is due, he gives me the in|tere&s;t, or &s;o much as I can make of it during that time. This amounts to a con&s;iderable &s;um where a man has good and large credit, and makes good u&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Remember that money is of a prolific, generating nature. Money can beget money, and its offspring can be|get more, and &s;o on. Five &s;hillings turned is &s;ix; turned again, it is &s;even and three-pence; and &s;o on till it becomes a hundred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, &s;o that the profits ri&s;e quicker and quicker.</P>
<P N="4">4. Remember that &s;ix pounds a year is but a groat a day. For this little &s;um (which may be daily wa&s;ted ei|ther in time or expen&s;e, unperceived) a man of credit may, on his own &s;ecurity, have the con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and u&s;e of a hundred pounds. So much in &s;tock, bri&s;kly turned by an indu&s;trious man, produces great advantage.</P>
<P N="5">5. Remember this &s;aying, "The good payma&s;ter is lord of another man's pur&s;e." He who is known to pay punc|tually and exactly at the time he promi&s;es, may at any time, and on any occa&s;ion, rai&s;e all the money his friends can &s;pare. This is &s;ometimes of great u&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. After indu&s;try and frugality, nothing contributes more to the rai&s;ing of a young man in the world, than punc|tuality and ju&s;tice in all his dealings; therefore never keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time you promi&s;ed, le&s;t a di&s;appointment &s;hut up your friend's pur&s;e forever.</P>
<P N="7">7. The mo&s;t trifling actions which affect a man's credit are to be regarded. The &s;ound of your hammer at five in the morning, or nine at night, heard by a creditor, makes him ea&s;y &s;ix months longer.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="73" REF="026674_0073_0FD155CE78B380C0">8. But if he &s;ees you at a billiard table, or hears your voice at a tavern, when you &s;hould be at work, he &s;ends for his money the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t day; demands it before he can re|ceive it in a lump.</P>
<P N="9">9. It &s;hows, be&s;ides, that you are mindful of what you owe; it makes you appear a careful, as well as an hone&s;t man, and that &s;till increa&s;es your credit.</P>
<P N="10">10. Beware of thinking all your own that you po&s;&s;e&s;s, and of living accordingly. It is a mi&s;take that many peo|ple who have credit fall into. To prevent this, keep an exact account, for &s;ome time, both of your expen&s;es and your income.</P>
<P N="11">11. If you take the pains at fir&s;t to mention particulars, it will have this good effect; you will di&s;cover how won|derfully, &s;mall, trifling expen&s;es mount up to large &s;ums, and will di&s;cern what might have been, and may for the fu|ture be &s;aved, without occa&s;ioning any great inconvenience.</P>
<P N="12">12. In &s;hort, the way to wealth, if you de&s;ire it, is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words, <HI>indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>frugality;</HI> that is, wa&s;te neither time nor money, but make the be&s;t u&s;e of both. Without in|du&s;try and frugality, nothing will do, and with them, every thing will do.</P>
<P N="13">13. He, who gets all he can hone&s;tly, and &s;aves all he gets (nece&s;&s;ary expen&s;es excepted) will certainly become <HI>rich</HI>; if that Being, who governs the world, to whom all &s;hould look for a ble&s;&s;ing on their hone&s;t endeavors, doth not, in his wi&s;e providence, otherwi&s;e determine.</P>

<HEAD>PARENTAL AFFECTION. STORY OF THE BEAR.</HEAD>
<P>THE white bear of Greenland and Spit&s;|bergen is con&s;iderably larger than the brown bear of Eu|rope, or the black bear of America. This bear is often &s;een on floats of ice, &s;everal leagues at &s;ea. The follow|ing is copied from the journal of a voyage, for making di&s;|coveries towards the North Pole.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="74" REF="026674_0074_0FD155CF9EF27470">2. Early in the morning, the man at the ma&s;t-head, gave notice that three bears were making their way very fa&s;t over the ice, and directing their cour&s;e towards the &s;hip. They had probably been invited by the blubber of a &s;ea hor&s;e, which the men had &s;et on fire, and which was burn|ing on the ice at the time of their approach.</P>
<P N="3">3. They proved to be a &s;he bear and her two cubs; but the cubs were nearly as large as the dam. They ran eagerly to the fire, and drew out from the flames part of the fle&s;h of the &s;ea hor&s;e, which remained uncon&s;umed, and ate it voraciou&s;ly.</P>
<P N="4">4. The crew from the &s;hip threw great pieces of the fle&s;h, which they had &s;till left, upon the ice, which the old bear carried away &s;ingly, laid every piece before her cubs; and, dividing them, gave each a &s;hare, re&s;erving but a &s;mall portion to her&s;elf. As &s;he was carrying away the la&s;t piece, they levelled their mu&s;kets at the cubs, and &s;hot them both dead; and in her retreat, they wounded the dam, but not mortally.</P>
<P N="5">5. It would have drawn tears of pity from any but un|feeling minds, to have marked the affectionate concern man|ife&s;ted by this poor bea&s;t, in the moments of her expiring young. Though &s;he was &s;orely wounded, and could but ju&s;t crawl to the place where they lay, &s;he carried the lump of fle&s;h &s;he had fetched away, as &s;he had done the others before, tore it in pieces, and laid it down before them; and when &s;he &s;aw they refu&s;ed to eat, &s;he laid her paws fir&s;t upon one, and then upon the other, and endeavored to rai&s;e them up.</P>
<P N="6">6. All this while it was piteous to hear her moan. When &s;he found &s;he could not &s;tir them, &s;he went off; and when at &s;ome di&s;tance, looked back and moaned; and that not availing to entice them away&punc; &s;he returned, and &s;melling around them, began to lick their wounds.</P>
<P N="7">7. She went off a &s;econd time, as before; and having crawled a few paces, looked again behind her, and for &s;ome time &s;tood moaning. But &s;till her cubs not ri&s;ing to follow her, &s;he returned to them again, and with &s;igns of inexpre&s;|&s;ible fondne&s;s, went round one, and round the other, paw|ing them, and moaning.</P>
<P N="8">8. Finding at la&s;t that they were cold and lifele&s;s, &s;he rai&s;ed her head towards the &s;hip, and growled her re&s;ent|ment
<PB N="75" REF="026674_0075_0FD155D1342A7248">
at the murderers; which they returned with a volley of mu&s;ket balls. She fell between her cubs, and died lick|ing their wounds.</P>
<P N="9">9. What child can read this intere&s;ting &s;tory, and not feel in his heart the warme&s;t emotions of gratitude, for the &s;tronger and more permanent tenderne&s;s he has experien|ced from his parents; while, at the &s;ame time, he feels his di&s;plea&s;ure ari&s;ing towards tho&s;e who treat with wanton barbarity any of the brute creation?</P>

<HEAD>THE VICTIM. AN INDIAN STORY.</HEAD>
<P>THE tragical death of an Indian of the <HI>Col|lapi&s;&s;a</HI> nation, (&s;ays a gentleman) who &s;acrificed him&s;elf for his country and &s;on, I have always admired, as di&s;playing the greate&s;t heroi&s;m, and placing human nature in the no|ble&s;t point of view.</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>Chactaw</HI> Indian, having one day expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf in the mo&s;t reproachful terms of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ench, and call|ed the <HI>Collapi&s;&s;as</HI> their dogs and their &s;laves, one of this nation, exa&s;perated at his in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous expre&s;&s;ions, laid him dead upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Chactaws,</HI> the mo&s;t numerous and the mo&s;t war|like tribe on the continent, immediately flew to arms. They &s;ent deputies to New-Orleans to demand from the French governor the head of the &s;avage who had fled to him for protection.</P>
<P N="4">4. The governor offered pre&s;ents as an atonement, but they were rejected with di&s;dain; and they threatened to exterminate the whole tribe of the <HI>Collapi&s;&s;as.</HI> To pacify this fierce nation, and prevent the effu&s;ion of blood, it was at length found nece&s;&s;ary to deliver up the unhappy Indian.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Sieur Ferrand, commander of the German po&s;ts, on the right of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, was charged with this mel|ancholy commi&s;&s;ion. A rendezvous was, in con&s;equence, appointed between the &s;ettlement of the <HI>Collapi&s;&s;as</HI> and the German po&s;ts, where the mournful ceremony was conduct|ed in the following manner.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="76" REF="026674_0076_0FD155D2DCDF0590">6. The Indian victim, who&s;e name was <HI>Mingo,</HI> was produced. He ro&s;e up, and, agreeably to the cu&s;tom of the people, harangued the a&s;&s;embly to the following purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="7">7. "I am a true man; that is to &s;ay, I fear not death; but I lament the fate of my wife and four infant children, whom I leave behind in a very tender age. I lament too my father and my mother, whom I have long maintained by hunting. Them, however, I recommend to the French, &s;ince, on their account, I now fall a &s;acrifice."</P>
<P N="8">8. Scarce had he fini&s;hed this &s;hort and pathetic ha|rangue, when the old father, &s;truck with the filial affection of his &s;on, aro&s;e, and thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his audience.</P>
<P N="9">9. "My &s;on is doomed to death; but he is young and vigorous, and more capable than I, to &s;upport his mother, his wife, and four infant children. It is nece&s;&s;ary, then, that he remain upon the earth to protect and provide for them. As for me who draw towards the end of my career, I have lived long enough. May my &s;on attain to my age, that he may bring up my tender infants. I am no longer good for any thing; a few years more or le&s;s are to me of &s;mall im|portance. I have lived as a man. I will die as a man. I therefore take the place of my &s;on."</P>
<P N="10">10. At the&s;e words, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ich expre&s;&s;ed his paternal love and greatne&s;s of &s;oul in the mo&s;t touching manner, his wife, his &s;on, his daughter-in-law, and the little infants, melted into tears around this brave, this generous old man. He embraced them for the la&s;t time, exhorted them to be ever faithful to the French, and to die rather than betray them by any mean treachery, unworthy of his blood. "My death," concluded he, "I con&s;ider nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the nation, and I glory in the &s;acrifice."</P>
<P N="11">11. Having thus delivered him&s;elf, he pre&s;ented his head to the kin&s;man of the decea&s;ed <HI>Chactaw;</HI> and they accepted it. He then extended him&s;elf over the trunk of a tree, when, with a hatchet, they &s;evered his head from his body.</P>
<P N="12">12. The French, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this tragedy, could not contain their tears, whil&s;t they admired the heroic con|&s;tancy of this venerable old man; who&s;e re&s;olution bore a re&s;emblance to that of the celebrated Roman orator, who, in the time of the triumvirate, was concealed by his &s;on.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="77" REF="026674_0077_0FD155D4456BF850">13.

<P N="14">14. The &s;on conjured them to take <HI>his</HI> life, and &s;pare the age of his father; but the &s;oldiers, more barbarous than the &s;avages, butchered them both on the &s;pot.</P>

<HEAD>THE ART OF PLEASING.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE often lamented, that they, who have taken the mo&s;t pains to recommend an attention to the art of plea&s;ing, have urged it only on the mean mo|tives of &s;elf-intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. In order to attain the power of plea&s;ing, they have recommended flattery and deceit; and though they have required in their pupils the appearances of many good qual|ities, they have not in&s;i&s;ted on any &s;ub&s;tantial or con&s;i&s;tent virtue.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is my wi&s;h to exalt this amiable talent of plea&s;ing to the rank of a virtue founded on principle, and on the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions of human nature. I would &s;eparate it from tho&s;e varni&s;hed qualities, which, like whited &s;epul|chres, are but a di&s;gui&s;e for internal deformity.</P>
<P N="4">4. A &s;tudent of the art of plea&s;ing, as it is taught in the &s;chool of fa&s;hion, is all &s;oftne&s;s and plau&s;ibility, all benevo|lence and genero&s;ity, all attention and a&s;&s;iduity, all graceful|ne&s;s and gentility. Such is the external appearance; but compare it with his private life, with tho&s;e actions which pa&s;s un&s;een, and you will find it by no means corre&s;pon|dent.</P>
<P N="5">5. You will u&s;ually find a hard heart, meanne&s;s, &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, avarice, and a total want of tho&s;e principles from which alone true benevolence, &s;incere friend&s;hip, and gen|tlene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition can originate. You will, indeed, find even the appearances of friend&s;hip and benevolence propor|tioned to the &s;uppo&s;ed riches and rank of him who&s;e favor and patronage are cultivated.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="78" REF="026674_0078_0FD155D5994A3E40">6. It is a favorite maxim with tho&s;e who teach the art of plea&s;ing, that if you de&s;ire to plea&s;e, you can &s;carcely fail to plea&s;e. But what motive, according to their doctrine, is to excite this de&s;ire? A wi&s;h to render all with whom you conver&s;e &s;ub&s;ervient to your intere&s;ted purpo&s;es of ava|rice or ambition.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is a mean and de&s;picable motive, when made the &s;ole and con&s;tant principle of conver&s;ation and behavior. If this life is the whole of our exi&s;tence; if riches and civ|il honors, are the chief good; if truth, honor, and genero&s;|ity, are but names to adorn declamation; then, indeed, they who practi&s;e the art of plea&s;ing, according to the vulgar idea of it, are, after all, the truly, and the only wi&s;e.</P>
<P N="8">8. But let us not think &s;o meanly of the world and its Creator; and if our favorable opinion of things be an error, it is not only pardonable but glorious; and a generous man will &s;ay, like the noble ancient, he had rather err with a Socrates and a Plato, than be right with a Machiavel.</P>
<P N="9">9. But, indeed, the virtues and the graces are much nearer allied, than they who are &s;trangers to the virtues are willing to acknowledge. There is &s;omething extremely beautiful in all the moral virtues, clearly under&s;tood and properly reduced to practice.</P>
<P N="10">10. Religion is al&s;o declared to be full of plea&s;antne&s;s, in that volume in which its nature is de&s;cribed with the greate&s;t authenticity. It mu&s;t indeed be allowed, that he who is actuated in his de&s;ire of plea&s;ing by morality and religion, may very properly add all the embelli&s;hments of external gracefulne&s;s; and he may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the &s;incerity of his principles, and the goodne&s;s of his character, will in&s;ure a degree of &s;ucce&s;s in his attempts to plea&s;e, which a fal&s;e pretender, with all his duplicity, can never obtain.</P>
<P N="11">11. If true politene&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in yielding &s;ome of our own preten&s;ions to the &s;elf-love of others, in repre&s;&s;ing our pride and arrogance, and in a gentlene&s;s of &s;entiment and conduct, &s;urely nothing can be more conducive to it than a religion which every where recommends brotherly love, meekne&s;s, and humility.</P>
<P N="12">12. I know not how paradoxical my opinion might ap|pear to the fa&s;hionable clubs at St. James', or to the pro|fe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="79" REF="026674_0079_0FD155DAF0D04EB0">
men of the world, or to the proficient in what I call the <HI>in&s;incere</HI> art of plea&s;ing; but I cannot help thinking, that a true Chri&s;tian, one who thinks and acts, as far as the infirmity of his nature will permit, con&s;i&s;tently with the prin|ciples of his religion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es qualities more capable of plea&s;ing, than any of tho&s;e which are &s;aid &s;o eminently to have di&s;tingui&s;hed a Marlborough and a Bollingbroke.</P>
<P N="13">13. The pious and amiable Mr. N&mdash; &s;eems to me to have de&s;erved the epithet of all-accompli&s;hed, much better than he to whom it has been &s;o often applied; and if we may judge of his writings, and the accounts given of his life, as on the one hand, there never was a better Chri&s;tian, &s;o, on the other, there never appeared a more polite gen|tleman.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is evident he derived his art of plea&s;ing, not from a &s;tudy of the world, or practi&s;ing the tricks of the littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> worldling, but from the lovely qualities recommended in the go&s;pel, and from an imitation of the humble Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="15">15. They who &s;tudy the art of plea&s;ing would perhaps &s;mile, were an in&s;tructor to refer them, for the be&s;t rules which have ever been given, to the &s;ermon on the mount.</P>
<P N="16">16. It is however certain, that the art of plea&s;ing, which is founded on &s;incere principles, derived from reli|gion and morality, is as far &s;uperior to that fal&s;e art, which con&s;i&s;ts only in &s;imulation and di&s;&s;imulation, as the fine bril|liancy of the real diamond excels the lu&s;tre of French pa&s;te; or as the ro&s;eate hue on the cheek of Hebe, the painted vi&s;age of a haggard courte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an.</P>
<P N="17">17. The in&s;incere art of plea&s;ing re&s;embles the inferior &s;pecies of timber in a building, which, in order to plea&s;e the eye, requires the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of paint: but the art which is founded on &s;incerity, is more like that which di&s;plays far greater beauty in the variety and richne&s;s of its own native veins and color.</P>
<P N="18">18. A &s;hort time, or a &s;light touch, de&s;troys the &s;uper|ficial beauty of the one; while the other acquires new graces from the hand of time.</P>
<P N="19">19. The rules and doctrines of religion and morality tend to correct all the malignant qualities of the heart; &s;uch as envy, malice, pride, and re&s;entment. In doing this, they cut off the very &s;ource of di&s;agreeable behavior.</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="80" REF="026674_0080_0FD155DCDB577360">20. Morality and religion inculcate whatever is ju&s;t, mild, moderate, candid, and benevolent. In doing this, they effectually promote a &s;y&s;tem of manners, which, with|out any &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign in the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them, cannot fail of being agreeable.</P>
<P N="21">21. If to the&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial powers of plea&s;ing are added the la&s;t poli&s;h of a graceful deportment, the habits acquired in good company, an acquaintance with men and manners, a ta&s;te for polite arts and polite books, no other requi&s;ites will be wanting to perfect the art, and form an all-accom|pli&s;hed character.</P>
<P N="22">22. A man will not be under the nece&s;&s;ity of hurting his con&s;cience and reputation in cultivating, I know not what, of a deceitful and affected behavior. He may be at once plea&s;ing and re&s;pectable, and grow in favor with men, without offending God.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF MR. PITT IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT, ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SLAVE TRADE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE I regret the ill &s;ucce&s;s which has hitherto attended my efforts on this &s;ubject, I am con&s;oled with the thought that the hou&s;e has now come to a re&s;olu|tion declarative of the infamy of the &s;lave trade.</P>
<P N="2">2. The only que&s;tion now is, on the continuance of this traffic, a traffic of which the very thought is beyond all human endurance; a traffic which even its friends think &s;o intolerable that it ought to be cru&s;hed. Yet the abolition of it is to be re&s;olved into a que&s;tion of expediency.</P>
<P N="3">3. Its advocates, in order to continue it, have de&s;erted even the principles of commerce; &s;o that, it &s;eems, a traf|fic in the liberty, the blood, the life of human beings, is not to have the advantages of the common rules of arithmetic, which govern all other commercial dealings.</P>
<P N="4">4. The point now in di&s;pute is the continuance for one year. As to tho&s;e who are concerned in this trade, a year will not be of any con&s;equence; but will it be of none to the unhappy &s;laves? It is true, that in the cour&s;e of commer|cial concerns in general, it is &s;aid &s;ometimes to be beneath the magnanimity of a man of honor to in&s;i&s;t on a &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, in his own favor, upon a di&s;puted item in accounts.</P>
<P N="5">5. But does it make any part of our magnanimity to be exact in our own favor in the traffic of human blood? If I could feel that any calculation upon the &s;ubject were to be made in this way, the &s;ide on which I &s;hould determine, would be in favor of the unhappy &s;ufferers; not of tho&s;e who oppre&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="85" REF="026674_0085_0FD155E5F1357D08">6. But this one year is only to &s;how the planters that Parliament is willing to be liberal to them! Sir, I do not under&s;tand complimenting away the lives of &s;o many hu|man beings. I do not comprehend the principle on which a few individuals are to be complimented, and their minds &s;et at re&s;t, at the expen&s;e and total &s;acrifice of the intere&s;t, the &s;ecurity, the happine&s;s of a whole quarter of this world, which, from our foul practices, has, for a va&s;t length of time, been a &s;cene of mi&s;ery and horror.</P>
<P N="7">7. I &s;ay, becau&s;e I feel, that in continuing this trade, you are guilty of an offence beyond your power to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one for; and by your indulgence to the planters, thou&s;ands of human beings are to be con&s;igned to mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="8">8. Every year in which you continue this trade, you add thou&s;ands to the catalogue of mi&s;ery, which, if you could behold in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, you would revolt with horror from the &s;cene; but the &s;ize of the mi&s;ery prevents you from beholding it. Five hundred out of one thou&s;and who are obtained in this traffic peri&s;h in this &s;cene of hor|ror; and are brought mi&s;erable victims to their graves.</P>
<P N="9">9. The remaining part of this wretched group are taint|ed both in body and mind, covered with di&s;ea&s;e and in|fection, carrying with them the &s;eeds of pe&s;tilence and in|&s;urrection to your i&s;lands.</P>
<P N="10">10. Let me then a&s;k the hou&s;e, whether they can de|rive any advantage from the&s;e doubtful effects of a calcu|lation on the continuance of the traffic: and whether two years will not be better than three for its continuance?</P>
<P N="11">11. For my part, I feel the infamy of the trade &s;o heav|ily, the impolicy of it &s;o clearly, that I am a&s;hamed not to have been able to have convinced the hou&s;e to abandon it altogether at an in&s;tant; to pronounce with one voice the immediate and total abolition. There is no excu&s;e for us. It is the very death of ju&s;tice to utter a &s;yllable in &s;upport of it.</P>
<P N="12">12. I know, Sir, I &s;tate this &s;ubject with warmth. I feel it is impo&s;&s;ible for me not to do &s;o; or if it were, I &s;hould dete&s;t my&s;elf for the exerci&s;e of moderation. I cannot, without &s;uffering every feeling and every pa&s;&s;ion that ought to ri&s;e in the cau&s;e of humanity to &s;leep within me, &s;peak coolly upon &s;uch a &s;ubject. And did they feel as I think they ought, I am &s;ure the deci&s;ion of the hou&s;e
<PB N="86" REF="026674_0086_0FD155EBA672BE30">
would be with us for a total and immediate abolition of this abominable traffic.</P>
<P N="13">13. In &s;hort, unle&s;s I have mi&s;under&s;tood the &s;ubject, and unle&s;s &s;ome rea&s;ons &s;hould be offered, much &s;uperior to any I have yet heard, I &s;hall think it the mo&s;t &s;ingular act that ever was done by a deliberative a&s;&s;embly, to refu&s;e to a&s;&s;ent to the propo&s;ed amendment. It has been by a re&s;o|lution declared to be the fir&s;t object of their de&s;ire, the fir&s;t object of their duty, and the fir&s;t object of their inclination.</P>

<HEAD>THE HUMANE INDIAN.</HEAD>
<P>AN Indian, who had not met with his u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s in hunting, wandered down to a plantation among the back &s;ettlements in Virginia; and &s;eeing a plant|er at his door, a&s;ked for a mor&s;el of bread, for he was very hungry. The planter bid him begone, for he would give him none.</P>
<P N="2">2. Will you give me a cup of your beer? &s;aid the In|dian. No, you &s;hall have none here, replied the planter. But I am very faint, &s;aid the &s;avage. Will you give me only a draught of cold water? Get you gone, you Indian dog; you &s;hall have nothing here, &s;aid the planter.</P>
<P N="3">3. It happened &s;ome months after, that the planter went on a &s;hooting party up into the woods, where, intent upon his game, he mi&s;&s;ed his company, and lo&s;t his way; and night coming on, he wandered through the fore&s;t, till he e&s;pied an Indian wigwam.</P>
<P N="4">4. He approached the &s;avage's habitation, and a&s;ked him to &s;how him the way to a plantation on that &s;ide the country. It is too late for you to go there this evening, Sir, &s;aid the Indian; but if you will accept of my homely fare, you are welcome.</P>
<P N="5">5. He then offered him &s;ome veni&s;on, and &s;uch other refre&s;hment as his &s;tore afforded, and having laid &s;ome bear&s;kins for his bed, he de&s;ired that he would repo&s;e him|&s;elf
<PB N="89" REF="026674_0089_0FD155F1678E6F30">
for the night, and he would awake him early in the morning, and conduct him on his way.</P>
<P N="6">6. Accordingly in the morning they &s;et off, and the In|dian led him out of the fore&s;t, and put him into the road which he was to pur&s;ue; but ju&s;t as they were taking leave, he &s;tepped before the planter, and turning round, &s;taring full in his face, a&s;ked him, whether he recollected his fea|tures. The planter was now &s;truck with &s;hame and con|fu&s;ion, when he recogni&s;ed in his kind protector, the Indian whom he had &s;o har&s;hly treated.</P>
<P N="7">7. He confe&s;&s;ed that he knew him, and was full of ex|cu&s;es for his brutal behavior; to which the Indian only replied; When you &s;ee poor Indians fainting for a cup of cold water, don't &s;ay again, "Get you gone, you Indian dog." The Indian then wi&s;hed him well on his journey, and left him. It is not difficult to &s;ay which of the&s;e two had the be&s;t claim to the name of Chri&s;tian.</P>

<HEAD>THE MAMMOTH.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the quadrupeds which have hitherto been de&s;cribed, the Mammoth is undoubtedly much the large&s;t. This animal is not known to have an exi&s;tence any where at pre&s;ent. We judge of it only from its bones and &s;keletons, which are of an unparalleled &s;ize, and are found in Siberia, Ru&s;&s;ia, Germany, and North-America.</P>
<P N="2">2. On the Ohio, and in many places farther north, tu&s;ks, grinders, and &s;keletons, which admit of no compari&s;on with any other animal at pre&s;ent known, are found in va&s;t numbers; &s;ome lying on the &s;urface of the earth, and &s;ome a little below it.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Mr. Stanley, taken pri&s;oner by the Indians near the mouth of the Tene&s;ee, relates, that, after being tran&s;|ferred from one tribe to another, he was at length carried over the mountains we&s;t of the Mi&s;&s;ouri to a river which runs we&s;twardly; that the&s;e bones abounded there; and that the natives &s;aid the animal was &s;till exi&s;ting in the northern parts of their country.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="90" REF="026674_0090_0FD155F2EA1F2078">4. A delegation of warriors from the Delaware tribe having vi&s;ited the governor of Virginia, during the late revolution, on matters of bu&s;ine&s;s; after the&s;e had been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and &s;ettled in council, the governor a&s;ked them &s;ome que&s;tions relative to their country, and, among others, what they knew or had heard of the animal who&s;e bones were found at the &s;altlicks on the Ohio.</P>
<P N="5">5. The chief &s;peaker immediately put him&s;elf into an attitude of oratory, and with a pomp &s;uited to what he conceived the elevation of his &s;ubject, informed him, that it was a tradition handed down from their fathers, "That in ancient times, a herd of the&s;e tremendous animals came to the Big-bonelicks, and began a univer&s;al de&s;truction of the bears, deer, elks, buffaloes, and other animals, which had been created for the u&s;e of the Indians."</P>
<P N="6">6. "That the Great Man above, looking down and &s;ee|ing this, was &s;o enraged that he &s;eized his lightning, de|&s;cended to the earth, &s;eated him&s;elf on a neighboring mountain, on a rock, on which his &s;eat and the print of his feet are &s;till to be &s;een, and hurled his bolts among them, till the whole were &s;laughtered, except the big bull, who, pre&s;enting his forehead to the &s;hafts, &s;hook them off as they fell; but mi&s;&s;ing one at length, it wounded him in the &s;ide; whereon, &s;pringing round, he bounded over the Waba&s;h, the Illinois, and finally over the great lakes, where he is living at this day."</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Friendly.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a treati&s;e on female education, which plea&s;es me much; and will, with dome&s;tic avocations, de|prive me of the plea&s;ure of walking with you this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Care.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what have you to do with treati&s;es on education? I &s;eldom read any thing, and never books of
<PB N="91" REF="026674_0091_0FD155F53855BCD8">
that kind. I &s;hould as &s;oon think of plodding through a volume of old &s;ermons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, I con&s;ider the education of youth, females in particular, to be a matter of the fir&s;t im|portance; and I take great plea&s;ure in reading the ob&s;er|vations of ingenious writers on the &s;ubject. I have chil|dren, in who&s;e welfare, I need not tell you, I am deeply intere&s;ted; and their happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, their honor or infamy, entirely depend, in my opinion, on the principles and habits they acquire in youth, whil&s;t the mind is tender, and the voice of in&s;truction &s;inks deep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Care.</SPEAKER>
<P>But cannot children be educated, unle&s;s their parents read books on the &s;ubject?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly they can, if the parents are them|&s;elves qualified for the ta&s;k. But I find it a difficult and delicate bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore I have recour&s;e to the wi&s;e and experienced for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in conducting it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Care.</SPEAKER>
<P>The a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the dancing, mu&s;ic, and drawing ma&s;ters is all I require for my children. They &s;hall indeed know &s;omething of reading, writing, and nee|dle work; but to give them a <HI>polite</HI> education and make them accompli&s;hed is my aim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, my dear Mrs. Carele&s;s, you do not di&s;tingui&s;h the advantages, which ari&s;e from a u&s;eful rather than a polite education; &s;ince you &s;peak with &s;o much in|difference of the former, and with &s;uch raptures of the latter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Care.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what are the mighty advantages of educating children in what you &s;tyle a u&s;eful manner? I never yet &s;aw them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are no very &s;trict ob&s;erver. (I beg your pardon for &s;peaking thus freely.) But &s;urely each day brings in&s;tances of its advantages; and each day &s;hows the mi&s;chief of a contrary mode. The kind of education I mention is that which tends to give females well regu|lated minds and agreeable manners; and render them be|loved, e&s;teemed, and admired. For it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary in order to this, that a young lady &s;hould be mi&s;|tre&s;s of all polite accompli&s;hments. They often belong to &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting and in&s;ignificant of the &s;ex. No, let parents form the growing mind to virtue, religion, and the calm plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic life, at the &s;ame time

endeavoring that cheerfulne&s;s play round the heart, and in|nocent gaiety enliven the behavior. Let the habit of &s;elf-government be early produced; for all the world con&s;pi|ring cannot make a woman happy who does not govern her pa&s;&s;ions. Let the fir&s;t appearance of &s;tubbornne&s;s in them be checked and re&s;i&s;ted; and let them be taught cheerful|ly to deny them&s;elves every object of de&s;ire, incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>rea&s;on, prudence,</HI> or <HI>virtue.</HI> Thus cultured, their tem|pers will be &s;weet and placid, and their manners gentle and engaging. If they be put under the care of tutors abroad; they will not be unteachable and refractory; and the pre&s;|ence of their parents will not be nece&s;&s;ary to make them behave with di&s;cretion and propriety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Care.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, after their minds are thus taken care of, how would you have them further accompli&s;hed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>They &s;hould be well ver&s;ed in reading, wri|ting, arithmetic, and Engli&s;h grammar. If their natural genius &s;trongly led them to poetry, painting, or mu&s;ic, and ea&s;y fortune admitted, it &s;hould be indulged and cultivated; but by no means to &s;uch a degree as to interrupt or &s;uper|&s;ede dome&s;tic employments. For the&s;e require attention in a greater or le&s;s degree from every woman; and unle&s;s &s;he under&s;tand and di&s;charge them according to her circum|&s;tances, &s;he is contemptible and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Care.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine accompli&s;hments, truly! a perfect &s;kill in handling the broom and du&s;ter! Mrs. Friendly, if you educate your children in this way, they will be ruined; they will be &s;trangers to the charms of dancing, dre&s;s and company.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend, I have no objection to dancing, dre&s;s and company, when they form not the chief object of &s;olicitude and attention, and are cultivated merely as the recreation and ornaments of life, and not as the bu&s;ine&s;s and end of it. Be a&s;&s;ured, a well furni&s;hed mind, a well gov|erned temper, love of dome&s;tic plea&s;ures, and an inclination and capacity to pur&s;ue dome&s;tic employments, are the fir&s;t requi&s;ites in a woman, and the foundation of her re&s;pecta|bility and enjoyment. Without the&s;e, though her graceful mien and dancing charm every eye, and her mu&s;ic be &s;weeter than the harp of Gabriel, &s;he mu&s;t be unhappy in

her&s;elf, and a vexation and torment to her friends. Let us view a per&s;on educated in the &s;chool of di&s;&s;ipation, and furni&s;hed with merely polite accompli&s;hments. Engro&s;&s;ed by the de&s;ire of leading a life of amu&s;ement before &s;he can even &s;pell a &s;entence, and unfurni&s;hed with ju&s;t &s;entiments and indu&s;trious habits, &s;he is &s;ent to the dancing academy that her manners may become graceful. Here &s;he &s;ees gayer dre&s;&s;es than her own, which inflame with vanity and envy her giddy, unoccupied mind. She is determined to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> outdone by none in elegance. She di&s;putes with Ma|ma about fa&s;hion and fine clothes; and if her extravagant de&s;ires are not indulged, murmurs and repines at her cruel fate; becomes confirmed in the dete&s;table habit of fretting; and knows not content but by the name. A fondne&s;s for tho&s;e phantoms, which lure to ruin, called plea&s;ures, and a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;how and parade, which perhaps through life &s;he can never indulge, gain entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart. All her joys are in gay parties and a&s;&s;emblies, where, like the butterfly of &s;ummer, &s;he plea&s;es by the brilliance of her colors only; which, however, is no &s;ooner familiar to the eye, than it is beheld with indifference; yet alas! this is all the attraction which this child of vanity can boa&s;t. Maturer years &s;teal on; her mind is &s;o uncultivated that &s;he is incapable of the rational plea&s;ures of thinking and conver&s;ation; her love of di&s;&s;ipation and amu&s;ement grows with her growth; &s;he &s;ighs for new plea&s;ures; but alas! &s;he has &s;o often travelled the circle, that their novelty is de&s;troyed. With all her apparent gaiety, &s;he is probably more wretched than the mi&s;creant, who begs the mor&s;el that &s;u&s;tains his being. If &s;he be ever placed at the head of a family, &s;he di&s;gu&s;ts her hu&s;band, neglects her children, and order, peace and indu&s;try are &s;trangers in her hou&s;e. Her company is ever unintere&s;ting or di&s;agreeable, her name is &s;ynonimous with folly, and her memory is lo&s;t with her life.</P>

<HEAD>SINGULAR ADVENTURE OF GENERAL PUTNAM.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN General Putnam fir&s;t moved to Pomfret, in Connecticut, in the year 1739, the country was new and much infe&s;ted with wolves. Great havoc was made among the &s;heep by a &s;he-wolf, which, with her an|nual whelps, had for &s;everal years continued in that vicinity. The young ones were commonly de&s;troyed by the vigilance of the hunters; but the old one was too &s;agacious to be en&s;nared by them.</P>
<P N="2">2. This wolf, at length, became &s;uch an intolerable nui&s;ance, that Mr. Putnam entered into a combination with five of his neighbors to hunt alternately until they could de&s;troy her. Two, by rotation, were to be con&s;tantly in pur&s;uit. It was known, that, having lo&s;t the toes from one foot, by a &s;teel trap, &s;he made one track &s;horter than the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. By this ve&s;tige, the pur&s;uers recognized, in a light &s;now, the route of this pernicious animal. Having follow|ed her to Connecticut river, and found &s;he had turned back in a direct cour&s;e towards Pomfret, they immediately re|turned, and by ten o'clock the next morning the blood|hounds had driven her into a den, about three miles di&s;tant from the hou&s;e of Mr. Putnam.</P>
<P N="4">4. The people &s;oon collected with dogs, guns, &s;traw, fire and &s;ulphur, to attack the common enemy. With this apparatus, &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts were made to force her from the den. The hounds came back badly wounded, and refu&s;ed to return. The &s;moke of blazing &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w had no effect. Nor did the fumes of burnt brim&s;tone, with which the cavern was filled, compel her to quit the retirement.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="95" REF="026674_0095_0FD15600320CC650">5. Wearied with &s;uch fruitle&s;s attempts (which had brought the time to ten o'clock at night) Mr. Putnam tri|ed once more to make his dog enter, but in vain; he pro|po&s;ed to his negro man to go down into the cavern and &s;hoot the wolf. The negro declined the hazardous &s;ervice.</P>
<P N="6">6. Then it was that their ma&s;ter, angry at the di&s;ap|pointment, and declaring that he was a&s;hamed of having a coward in his family, re&s;olved him&s;elf to de&s;troy the fero|cious bea&s;t, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould e&s;cape through &s;ome unknown fi&s;&s;ure of the rock.</P>
<P N="7">7. His neighbors &s;trongly remon&s;trated again&s;t the per|ilous enterprize; but he, knowing that wild animals were intimidated by fire, and having provided &s;everal &s;trips of birch bark, the only combu&s;tible material which he could obtain, which would afford light in this deep and dark&s;ome cave, prepared for his de&s;cent.</P>
<P N="8">8. Having, accordingly, dive&s;ted him&s;elf of his coat and wai&s;tcoat, and having a long rope fa&s;tened round his l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, by which he might be pulled back, at a concerted &s;ig|nal, he entered, head foremo&s;t, with the blazing torch in his hand.</P>
<P N="9">9. Having groped his pa&s;&s;age till he came to a hori|zontal part of the den, the mo&s;t terrifying darkne&s;s appear|ed in front of the dim circle of light afforded by his torch. It was &s;ilent as the hou&s;e of death. None but mon&s;ters of the de&s;art had ever before explored this &s;olitary man&s;ion of horror.</P>

He cautiou&s;ly proceeding onward, came to an a&s;|cent; which he &s;lowly mounted on his hands and knees until he di&s;covered the glaring eyeballs of the wolf, who was &s;itting at the extremity of the cavern. Startled at the &s;ight of fire, &s;he gna&s;hed her teeth and gave a &s;ullen growl.</P>
<P N="11">11. As &s;oon as he had made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;covery, he kicked the rope as a &s;ignal for pulling him out. The people, at the mouth of the den, who had li&s;tened with painful anxiety, hearing the growling of the wolf, and &s;up|po&s;ing their friend to be in the mo&s;t imminent danger, drew him forth with &s;uch celerity that he was &s;tripped of his clothes, and &s;everely brui&s;ed.</P>
<P N="12">12. After he had adju&s;ted his clothes, and loaded his gun with nine buck &s;hot, holding a torch in one hand and

the mu&s;ket in the other, he de&s;cended a &s;econd time. When he drew nearer than before, the wolf a&s;&s;uming a &s;till more fierce and terrible appearance, howling, rolling her eyes, &s;napping her teeth, and dropping her head between her legs, was evidently in the attitude and on the point of &s;pringing at him.</P>
<P N="13">13. At this critical in&s;tant, he levelled and fired at her head. Stunned with the &s;hock, and &s;uffocated with the &s;moke, he immediately found him&s;elf drawn out of the cave. But having refre&s;hed him&s;elf and permitted the &s;moke to di&s;&s;ipate, he went down the third time.</P>
<P N="14">14. Once more he came within &s;ight of the wolf, who appearing very pa&s;&s;ive, he applied the torch to her no&s;e; and perceiving her dead, he took hold of her ears, and then kicking the rope (&s;till tied round his legs) the people above, with no &s;mall exultation, dragged them both out together.</P>

<P>If &s;he were ten times more whim&s;ical than &s;he is, I am certain &s;he would like it; for you &s;old it to me your|&s;elf, and you a&s;&s;ured me it was the be&s;t you ever had.</P>

<P>Yes, yes, that's true, indeed; I always have the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of every thing. You know, neighbor Derby, that no one is more ready to oblige than I am; but I mu&s;t tell you the mare this morning refu&s;ed to eat hay; and truly I am afraid &s;he will not carry you.</P>

<STAGE>[He gives Tim. a wink.]</STAGE>
However, I believe &s;he is well enough by this time. You know, Tim, how ready I am to oblige my neighbors. And, indeed, we ought to do all the good we can in this world. We mu&s;t certainly let neighbor Derby have her, if &s;he will po&s;&s;ibly an&s;wer his purpo&s;e. Yes, yes; I &s;ee plainly by Tim's countenance, neighbor Derby, that he's di&s;po&s;ed to oblige you. I would not have refu&s;ed you the mare for the worth of her. If I had, I &s;hould have expected you would have refu&s;ed me in your turn. None of my neighbors can accu&s;e me of being back|ward in doing them a kindne&s;s. Come, Timothy, what do you &s;ay?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tim.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do I &s;ay, father! Why I &s;ay, Sir, that I am no le&s;s ready than you are to do a neighborly kindne&s;s. But the mare is by no means capable of performing the journey. About a hand's breadth did you &s;ay, Sir! Why the &s;kin is torn from the poor creature's back, of the big|ne&s;s of your great brimm'd hat. And, be&s;ides, I have promi&s;ed her, as &s;oon as &s;he is able to travel, to Ned Saun|ders, to carry a load of apples to the market.</P>

<P>Do you hear that, neighbor? I am very &s;orry matters turn out thus. I would not have di&s;obliged you for the price of two &s;uch mares. Believe me, neighbor Derby, I am really &s;orry for your &s;ake, that matters turn out thus.</P>

<HEAD>ON PROFANE SWEARING.</HEAD>
<P>FEW evil habits are of more pernicious con|&s;equence, or overcome with more difficulty, than that very odious one of profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing. It cannot be expected that the force of moral principles &s;hould be very &s;trong upon any one who is accu&s;tomed, upon every trivial occa&s;ion, and frequently without any occa&s;ion at all, to &s;light the precepts and the character of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P N="2">2. When we have lo&s;t any degree of re&s;pect for the Au|thor of our exi&s;tence, and the concerns of futurity, and can bring the mo&s;t awful appellations into our &s;lighte&s;t conver|&s;ation, merely by way of embelli&s;hing our fooli&s;h&punc; and per|haps fallacious narratives, or to give a greater force to our little re&s;entments, con&s;cience will &s;oon lo&s;e its influence up|on our minds.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nothing but the fear of di&s;grace, or a dread of hu|man laws, will re&s;train any per&s;on, addicted to common &s;weating, from the mo&s;t dete&s;table perjury.</P>
<P N="4">4. For if a man can be brought to trifle with the mo&s;t &s;acred things in his common di&s;cour&s;e, he cannot &s;urely con&s;ider them of more con&s;equence when his intere&s;t leads him to &s;wear fal&s;ely for his own defence or emolument.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is really a&s;toni&s;hing how imperceptibly this vice creeps upon a per&s;on, and how rootedly he afterwards ad|heres to it. People generally begin with u&s;ing only &s;light exclamations, and which &s;eem hardly to carry the appear|ance of any thing criminal; and &s;o proceed on to others, till the mo&s;t &s;hocking oaths become familiar.</P>
<P N="6">6. And when once the habit is confirmed, it is rarely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eradicated. The &s;wearer lo&s;es the ideas which are attached to the words he makes u&s;e of, and therefore exe|crates his friend when he means to ble&s;s him; and calls God to witne&s;s his intention of doing things, which he knows he has no thoughts of performing in reality.</P>
<P N="7">7. A young gentleman with whom I am intimately ac|quainted, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many excellent qualifications, but unhappily in a declining &s;tate of health, and evidently tending rapidly to the chambers of death, has been from his
<PB N="102" REF="026674_0102_0FD12B11412A2050">
childhood &s;o addicted to the practice of &s;wearing in his common conver&s;ation, that even now I am frequently &s;hocked by his profaning the name of that &s;acred Being before whom he, mo&s;t probably, will &s;oon be obliged to appear.</P>
<P N="8">8. It mu&s;t &s;urely be exceedingly painful to a &s;en&s;ible heart, feeling for the be&s;t intere&s;ts of a valuable friend, and otherwi&s;e, excellent acquaintance, to ob&s;erve the per&s;on he &s;o highly regards confirmed in &s;uch a &s;hocking habit, even while &s;tanding in the mo&s;t awful &s;ituation in which it is po&s;&s;ible for a human creature to be placed.</P>
<P N="9">9. Almo&s;t every other vice affords its votaries &s;ome pretences of excu&s;e, from its being productive of pre&s;ent plea&s;ure, or affording a pro&s;pect of future advantage; but the profane &s;wearer cannot even &s;ay that he feels any &s;at|isfaction, or that he hopes to meet with any benefit, from this fooli&s;h habit.</P>
<P N="10">10. Let tho&s;e then, who are addicted to this vice, &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ider how aggravated a guilt it is to offend the De|ity continually, without having the lea&s;t &s;hadow of an excu&s;e for &s;o doing; and determine at once to regulate their con|ver&s;ation and conduct in &s;uch a manner as to a&s;&s;ure to them|&s;elves the permanent &s;atisfaction which will re&s;ult, at the clo&s;e of life, from the reflection that they have erred no farther from the rules of eternal ju&s;tice, than the common condition of humanity in its pre&s;ent &s;tate renders unavoid|able; and that they have endeavored, to the utmo&s;t of their power, to correct every error in their conduct, when they have felt it condemned by the dictates of con&s;cience.</P>

<P>A MERCHANT of Provence, in France, of a mo&s;t amiable character, but of narrow circum&s;tances, met with &s;ome con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es in trade, and became a bankrupt. Being reduced to penury and want, he went to Paris to &s;eek &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

The unfortunate merchant's &s;on, who was about twenty-two years of age, being informed of the &s;orrowful &s;ituation of his father, ha&s;tened to Paris, threw him&s;elf at the feet of the unrelenting creditor, and, drowned in tears, be|&s;ought him in the mo&s;t affecting expre&s;&s;ions, to conde&s;cend to re&s;tore him his father, prote&s;ting to him, that, if he would not throw ob&s;tacles in the way to his father's re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ing his affairs, of the po&s;&s;ibility of which they had great rea&s;on to hope, he &s;hould be the fir&s;t man paid.</P>
<P N="5">5. He implored him to have pity on his youth, and to have &s;ome feelings for the misfortunes of an aged mother, encumbered with eight children, reduced to want, and near|ly on the point of peri&s;hing. La&s;tly, that if the&s;e con&s;ider|ations were not capable of moving him to pity, he entreated him, at lea&s;t, to permit him to be confined in pri&s;on in&s;tead of his father, in order that he might be re&s;tored to his family.</P>
<P N="6">6. The youth uttered the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in &s;o affecting a manner, that the creditor, &s;truck with &s;o much virtue and genero&s;ity, at once &s;oftened into tears, and rai&s;ing the youth from his humble po&s;ture, Ah! my &s;on, &s;aid he, your father &s;hall be relea&s;ed. So much love and re&s;pect, which you have &s;hown for him, makes me a&s;hamed of my&s;elf. I have carried this matter too far; but I will endeavor forever to efface the remembrance of it from your mind.</P>

<P>MISS Nancy, what child was that your aunt had in her arms this morning, as &s;he was walk|ing in the mall?</P>

<P>A child! Mi&s;s Eliza; a child! You don't think my aunt would be &s;een walking in public with a child in her arms!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Pray, Mi&s;s, where would be the harm? I know &s;he has a beautiful pair of twins; and I thought it might be one of them, as it was partly covered with her cloak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed&mdash;it was her lap-dog.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eli.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Nancy, you have mended the matter mightily! Your aunt is a&s;hamed to be &s;een walking with a child in her arms; but is not a&s;hamed to be &s;een carrying a paltry puppy through the &s;treets! Pray how much more valuable is a puppy than a child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as to the real value, Eliza, I don't know but a child &s;hould be prized the highe&s;t. Though my aunt &s;ays &s;he had rather part with both her twins than lo&s;e her dear little <HI>Trip.</HI> But, you know, &s;he would be taken for one of the <HI>lower &s;ort</HI> of women, if &s;he were to lug a child about with her; whereas nothing makes her appear more like a <HI>lady</HI> than to be &s;een gallanting her little dog. And <HI>Trip</HI> is none of your <HI>common curs,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you. His mother was imported from Europe; and it is &s;aid &s;he once belonged to a lady of nobility. You can't think what a &s;weet little creature he is. My aunt nur&s;ed him wholly her&s;elf ever &s;ince he was a week old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eli.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who nur&s;ed the twins?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were put into the country with a very good woman. They have never been at home but once &s;ince they were born. But their mama vi&s;its them as often, at lea&s;t, as once a month.</P>

<P>Would &s;he be willing to be as long ab&s;ent from her dear little <HI>Trip,</HI> as you call him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no, indeed! She would run crazy, if &s;he were to lo&s;e him but for one day. And no wonder; for he is the mo&s;t engaging little animal you ever &s;aw. You would be diverted to &s;ee him drink tea out of the ladies' cups. And he ki&s;&s;es his mi&s;tre&s;s delightfully! My aunt &s;ays &s;he would not &s;leep a night without him for his weight in gold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eli.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very noble in your aunt to pay &s;uch attention to an object of &s;o much con&s;equence. He is certainly more valuable than <HI>half a dozen</HI> children. Does your aunt ex|pect to learn him to talk?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Talk! why he talks already. She &s;ays &s;he per|fectly under&s;tands his language. When he is hungry, he can a&s;k for &s;weet meats. When he is dry, he can a&s;k for drink. When he is tired of running on foot, he can a&s;k to ride; and my aunt is never more happy than when &s;he has him in her arms!</P>

<SPEAKER>Eli.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet &s;he would not be &s;een with one of her own children in her arms!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that would be very <HI>vulgar;</HI> and all her ac|quaintance would laugh at her. Children, you know, are always crying; and no ladies of fa&s;hion will ever admit them into their company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eli.</SPEAKER>
<P>If children are always <HI>crying,</HI> little dogs are often <HI>barking,</HI> and which is the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable noi&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the barking of <HI>Trip</HI> is <HI>mu&s;ic</HI> to all who hear him! Mr. Fribble, who often vi&s;its my aunt, &s;ays he can rai&s;e and fall the eight notes to perfection; and he prefers the &s;ound of his voice to that of the harp&s;ichord. It was he who brought his mother from London; and he &s;ays there was not a greater favorite among all the dogs, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fine ladies of court. And, more than all that, he &s;ays <HI>Trip</HI> greatly re&s;embles a &s;paniel which belongs to one of the roy|al family. Mr. Fribble and my aunt almo&s;t quarrelled la&s;t night, to &s;ee which &s;hould have the honor of carrying the dear little favorite to the play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eli.</SPEAKER>
<P>After hearing &s;o many rare qualifications of the little quadruped, I do not wonder at your aunt's choice of a companion. I am not &s;urprized &s;he &s;hould &s;et her affections upon a creature &s;o de&s;erving of all her care. It is to be

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM THE ORATION OF THO|MAS DAWES, ESQ. DELIVERED AT BOS|TON,
<DATE>JULY 4, 1787.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THAT Education is one of the deepe&s;t prin|ciples of independence, need not be labored in this a&s;&s;em|bly. In arbitrary governments, where the people neither make the law nor chu&s;e tho&s;e who legi&s;late, the more ig|norance the more peace.</P>
<P N="2">2. But in a government where the people fill all the branches of the &s;overeignty, <HI>intelligence</HI> is the life of liberty. An American would re&s;ent his being denied the u&s;e of his mu&s;ket; but he would deprive him&s;elf of a &s;tronger &s;afe|guard, if he &s;hould want that <HI>learning</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary to a knowledge of his con&s;titution.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that our agrarian law and the law of education were calculated to make republicans; to make <HI>men.</HI> Servitude could never long con&s;i&s;t with the habits of &s;uch citizens. Enlightened minds and virtuous manners lead to the gates of glory. The &s;entiment of independence mu&s;t have been <HI>connatural</HI> in the bo&s;oms of Americans; and, &s;ooner or later, mu&s;t have blazed out into public action.</P>
<P N="4">4. Independence fits the &s;oul of her re&s;idence for every noble enterprize of humanity and greatne&s;s. Her radiant &s;mile lights up cele&s;tial ardor in poets and orators, who &s;ound her prai&s;es through all ages; in legi&s;lators and phi|lo&s;ophers, who fabricate wi&s;e and happy governments as dedications to her fame; in patriots and heroes, who &s;hed their lives in &s;acrifice to her divinity.</P>
<P N="5">5. At this idea, do not our minds &s;well with the mem|ory of tho&s;e who&s;e godlike virtues have founded her mo&s;t

But what trib|ute &s;hall we be&s;tow, what &s;acred paean &s;hall we rai&s;e over the tombs of tho&s;e who dared, in the face of unrivalled power, and within the reach of maje&s;ty, to blow the bla&s;t of freedom throughout a &s;ubject continent?</P>
<P N="6">6. Nor did tho&s;e brave countrymen of ours only <HI>ex|pre&s;s</HI> the emotions of glory: the nature of their principles in&s;pired them with the power of <HI>practice;</HI> and they offer|ed their bo&s;oms to the &s;hafts of battle. Bunker's awful mount is the capacious urn of their a&s;hes; but the flaming bounds of the univer&s;e could not limit the flight of their minds.</P>
<P N="7">7. They fled to the union of kindred &s;ouls; and tho&s;e who fell at the &s;treights of Thermopylae, and tho&s;e who bled on the heights of Charle&s;town, now reap congenial joys in the fields of the ble&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>GENERAL WASHINGTON'S RESIGNATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. PRESIDENT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE great events on which my re&s;ignation depended having at length taken place, I have now the ho|nor of offering my &s;incere congratulations to Congre&s;s, and of pre&s;enting my&s;elf before them to &s;urrender into their hands the tru&s;t committed to me, and to claim the indul|gence of retiring from the &s;ervice of my country.</P>
<P N="2">2. Happy in the confirmation of our independence and &s;overeignty, and plea&s;ed with the opportunity afforded the United States of becoming a re&s;pectable nation, I re&s;ign, with &s;atisfaction, the appointment I accepted with diffi|dence; a diffidence in my abilities to accompli&s;h &s;o ardu|ous a ta&s;k, which, however was &s;uper&s;eded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cau&s;e, the &s;upport of the &s;upreme power of the Union, and the patronage of Heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;ucce&s;sful termination of the war has verified the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations; and my gratitude for the interpo&s;ition of Providence, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have re|ceived

<P N="5">5. It was impo&s;&s;ible the choice of confidential officers to compo&s;e my family &s;hould have been more fortunate. Permit me, Sir, to recommend in particular tho&s;e who have continued in the &s;ervice to the pre&s;ent moment, as worthy of the favorable notice and patronage of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. I con&s;ider it as an indi&s;pen&s;able duty to clo&s;e this la&s;t &s;olemn act of my official life, by commending the intere&s;ts of our deare&s;t country to the protection of Almighty God, and tho&s;e who have the &s;uperintendence of them, to his ho|ly keeping.</P>
<P N="7">7. Having now fini&s;hed the work a&s;&s;igned me, I retire from the great theatre of action; and bidding an affection|ate farewell to this augu&s;t body, under who&s;e orders I have &s;o long acted, I here offer my commi&s;&s;ion, and take my leave of all the employments of public life.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF A SCYTHIAN AMBASSADOR TO ALEXANDER.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Scythian amba&s;&s;adors waited on Alexander the Great, they gazed on him a long time without &s;peaking a word, being very probably &s;urpri&s;ed, as they formed a judgment of men from their air and &s;tature, to find that his did not an&s;wer the high idea they entertain|ed of him from his fame.</P>
<P N="2">2. At la&s;t the olde&s;t of the amba&s;&s;adors addre&s;&s;ed him thus. "Had the gods given thee a body proportionable to thy ambition, the whole univer&s;e would have been too little for thee. With one hand thou would&s;t touch the Ea&s;t, and with the other the We&s;t; and, not &s;atisfied with this,
<PB N="110" REF="026674_0110_0FD156149C49C2A0">
thou would&s;t follow the &s;un, and know where he hides him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. But what have we to do with thee? We never &s;et foot in thy country. May not tho&s;e who inhabit woods be allow|ed to live, without knowing who thou art, and whence thou come&s;t? We will neither command over, or &s;ubmit to any man.</P>
<P N="4">4. And that thou maye&s;t be &s;en&s;ible what kind of peo|ple the Scythians are, know, that we received from Hea|ven, as a rich pre&s;ent, a yoke of oxen, a plow&s;hare, a dart, a javelin, and a cup. The&s;e we make u&s;e of, both with our friends and again&s;t our enemies.</P>
<P N="5">5. To our friends we give corn, which we procure by the labor of our oxen; with them we offer wine to the gods in our cup; and with regard to our enemies, we com|bat them at a di&s;tance with our arrows, and near at hand with our javelins.</P>
<P N="6">6. But thou, who boa&s;te&s;t thy coming to extirpate rob|bers, art thy&s;elf the greate&s;t robber upon earth. Thou ha&s;t plundered all nations thou overcame&s;t; thou ha&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thy&s;elf of Lybia, invaded Syria, Per&s;ia, and Bactriana; thou art forming a de&s;ign to march as far as India, and now thou come&s;t hither to &s;eize upon our herds of cattle.</P>
<P N="7">7. The great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions thou ha&s;t, only make thee covet the more eagerly what thou ha&s;t not. If thou art a god, thou oughte&s;t to do good to mortals, and not deprive them of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="8">8. If thou art a mere man, reflect always on what thou art. They whom thou &s;halt not mole&s;t will be thy true friends; the &s;tronge&s;t friend&s;hips being contracted between equals; and they are e&s;teemed equals who have not tried their &s;trengh again&s;t each other.

<HEAD>THE REVENGE OF A GREAT SOUL.</HEAD>
<P>DEMETRIUS Poliorcetes, who had done &s;ingular &s;ervices for the people of the city of Athens, on &s;etting out for a war in which he was engaged, le&s;t his wife
<PB N="111" REF="026674_0111_0FD156149FA0B5D0">
and children to their protection. He lo&s;t the battle, and was obliged to &s;eek &s;ecurity for his per&s;on in flight.</P>
<P N="2">2. He doubted not, at fir&s;t, but that he &s;hould find a &s;afe a&s;ylum among his good friends the Athenians; but tho&s;e ungrateful people refu&s;ed to receive him, and even &s;ent back to him his wife and children, under pretence, that they probably might not be &s;afe in Athens, where the ene|my might come and take them.</P>
<P N="3">3. This conduct pierced the heart of Demetrius; for nothing is &s;o affecting to an hone&s;t mind, as the ingratitude of tho&s;e we love, and to whom we have done &s;ingular &s;er|vices. Some time afterwards, this prince recoverd his affairs, and came with a large army to lay &s;iege to Athens.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Athenians, per&s;uaded that they had no pardon to expect from Demetrius, determined to die &s;word in hand, and pa&s;&s;ed a decree, which condemned to death tho&s;e who &s;hould fir&s;t propo&s;e to &s;urrender to that prince; but they did not recollect, that there was but little corn in the city, and that they would in a &s;hort time be in want of bread.</P>
<P N="5">5. Want &s;oon made them &s;en&s;ible of their error: and, after having &s;uffered hunger for a long time, the mo&s;t rea|&s;onable among them &s;aid, "It would be better that Deme|trius &s;hould kill us at once, than for us to die by the linger|ing death of famine. Perhaps he will have pity on our wives and children." They then opened to him the gates of the city.</P>
<P N="6">6. Demetrius, having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, order|ed, that all the married men &s;hould a&s;&s;emble in a &s;pacious place appointed for the purpo&s;e, and that the &s;oldiery, &s;word in hand, &s;hould &s;urround them. Cries and lamentations were then heard from every quarter of the city; women embracing their hu&s;bands, children their parents, and all taking an eternal farewell of each other.</P>
<P N="7">7. When the married men were all thus collected, Demetrius, for whom an elevated &s;ituation was provided, reproached them for their ingratitude in the mo&s;t feeling manner, in&s;omuch that he him&s;elf could not help &s;hedding tears. Demetrius for &s;ome time remained &s;ilent, while the Athenians expected, that the next words he uttered would be to order his &s;oldiers to ma&s;&s;acre them all.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="112" REF="026674_0112_0FD15616F81E93C0">8. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what mu&s;t have been their &s;urprize, when they heard that good prince &s;ay, "I wi&s;h to convince you how ungenerou&s;ly you have treated me; for it was not to an enemy you have refu&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but to a prince who loved you, who &s;till loves you, and who wi&s;hes to revenge him&s;elf only by granting your pardon, and by being &s;till your friend.

<HEAD>CUDJOE, THE FAITHFUL AFRICAN.</HEAD>
<P>A NEW-ENGLAND &s;loop, trading on the coa&s;t of Guinea, in 1752, left a &s;econd mate, William Murray. &s;ick on &s;hore, and &s;ailed without him. Murray was at the hou&s;e of a black man named Cudjoe, with whom he had contracted an acquaintance during their trade.</P>
<P N="2">2. He recovered; and the &s;loop being gone, he con|tinued with his black friend till &s;ome other opportunity &s;hould offer of his getting home. In the mean time a Dutch &s;hip came into the road, and &s;ome of the blacks coming on board her, were treacherou&s;ly &s;eized and carried off as their &s;laves.</P>
<P N="3">3. The relations and friends, tran&s;ported with &s;udden rage, ran to the hou&s;e of Cudjoe, to take revenge by killing Murray. Cudjoe &s;topped them at the door, and demanded what they wanted. The white men, &s;aid they, have car|ried away our brothers and &s;ons, and we will kill all white men.</P>
<P N="4">4. Give us the white man you have in your hou&s;e, for we will kill him. Nay, &s;aid Cudjoe, the white men who carried away your relations are bad men; kill them when you can take them; but this white man is a good man, and you mu&s;t not kill him. But he is a white man, they cried; and the white men are all bad men; we mu&s;t kill them all. Nay, &s;ays he, you mu&s;t not kill a man who has done no harm, only for being white.</P>
<P N="5">5. This man is my friend, my hou&s;e is his po&s;t, I am his &s;oldier, and mu&s;t fight for him; you mu&s;t kill me be|fore

you can kill him. What good man will ever come again under my roof, if I let my floor be &s;tained with a good man's blood?</P>
<P N="6">6. The negroes &s;eeing his re&s;olution, and being con|vinced by his di&s;cour&s;e that they were wrong, went away a&s;hamed. In a few days Murray ventured abroad again with his friend Cudjoe, when &s;everal of them took him by the hand, and told him, they were glad they had not killed him; for as he was a good meaning, innocent man, their god would have been very angry, and would have &s;poiled their fi&s;hing.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE BETWEEN MERCURY AND A MODERN FINE LADY; SHOWING THE FUTILE EN|GAGEMENTS AND PURSUITS OF A MODISH WOMAN.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Modi&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>INDEED, Mr. Mercury, I can|not have the plea&s;ure of waiting upon you now. I am en|gaged, ab&s;olutely engaged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mercury.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you have an amiable, affectionate hu&s;|band, and &s;everal fine children. But you need not be told, that neither conjugal attachments, maternal affections, nor even the care of a kingdom's welfare, can excu&s;e a per&s;on who has received a &s;ummons to the realms of death. If the grim me&s;&s;enger were not as peremptory as unwelcome, Charon would not get a pa&s;&s;enger once in a century. You mu&s;t be content to leave your hu&s;band and family, and pa&s;s the Styx.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not mean to in&s;i&s;t on any engagements with my hu&s;band and children. I never thought my&s;elf engaged to them. I had no engagements but &s;uch as were common to women in high life. Look at my memoran|dum, and you will &s;ee I was engaged to the play on Mon|days, balls on Tue&s;days, routs on Saturdays, and to card a&s;&s;emblies the re&s;t of the week for two months to come; and it would be the rude&s;t thing in the world not to keep my appointments. If you will &s;tay for me till the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, I will wait on you with all my heart. Perhaps the ely&s;ian fields may be le&s;s dete&s;table than the country in our world. Pray have you a fine theatre, plea&s;ant gardens, and elegant a&s;&s;emblies there? I think I &s;hould not di&s;like drinking the Lethe waters when you have a full &s;ea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely you could not like to drink the waters of oblivion, who have made plea&s;ure the bu&s;ine&s;s, end, and aim of your life! It is good to drown cares; but who would wa&s;h away the remembrance of a life of gaiety and plea&s;ure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Diver&s;ion was indeed the bu&s;ine&s;s of my life; but as to <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> I have enjoyed none &s;ince the novelty of my amu&s;ements has worn off. Can one be plea&s;ed with &s;eeing the &s;ame thing over and over again? Late hours and

fatigue gave me the vapors, &s;poiled the natural cheerfulne&s;s of my temper, and even in youth wore away my youthful vivacity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this mode of life did not give you plea&s;ure, why did you continue in it? I &s;uppo&s;e you did not think it very meritorious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was too much engaged to <HI>think</HI> at all. Thus far indeed my manner of life was agreeable enough. My friends always told me diver&s;ions were nece&s;&s;ary; and my doctor a&s;&s;ured me di&s;&s;ipation was good for my &s;pirits; my hu&s;band in&s;i&s;ted that it was not. And you know one loves to oblige one's friends, comply with one's doctor, and contradict one's hu&s;band. And, be&s;ides, I was ambitious to be thought <HI>du bon ton.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Bon ton!</HI> What is that, madam, pray define it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>O Sir, excu&s;e me; it is one of the privileges of the <HI>bon ton</HI> never to define or be defined. It is the child and parent of jargon. It is&mdash;I can never tell you what it is; but I will try to tell you what it is not. In conver&s;ation it is not wit; in manners it is not politene&s;s; in behavior it is not addre&s;s; but it is a little like them all. It can only belong to people of a certain rank, who live in a certain manner, with certain per&s;ons, and who have not certain virtues, and who have certain vices, and who inhab|it a certain part of the town. Now, Sir, I have told you as much as I know of it, though I have admired and aim|ed at it all my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, madam, you have wa&s;ted your time, faded your beauty, and de&s;troyed your health, for the laudable purpo&s;es of contradicting your hu&s;band, and being this &s;ome|thing and this nothing called the <HI>bon ton.</HI></P>

<P>I will follow your own mode of in&s;tructing. I will tell you what I would <HI>not</HI> have had you do.

<P>As to the education of my daughters, I &s;pared no expen&s;e. They had a dancing ma&s;ter, mu&s;ic ma&s;ter, drawing ma&s;ter, and a French governe&s;s to teach them politene&s;s and the French language.</P>

<P>So their religion, &s;entiments and manners were to be learned from a dancing ma&s;ter, mu&s;ic ma&s;ter, and a chamber maid! Perhaps they might prepare them to catch the <HI>bon ton.</HI> Your daughters mu&s;t have been &s;o educated as to fit them to be wives without conjugal affection, and mothers without maternal care. I am &s;orry for the &s;ort of life they are commencing, and for that which you have ju&s;t concluded. Minos is a &s;our old gentleman, without the lea&s;t &s;mattering of the <HI>bon ton,</HI> and I am in a fright for you. The be&s;t thing I can advi&s;e you, is to do in this world as you did in the other; keep happine&s;s in your view, but never take the road that leads to it. Remain on this &s;ide Styx; wander about without end or aim; look in|to the ely&s;ian fields, but never attempt to enter into them, le&s;t Minos &s;hould pu&s;h you into Tartarus. For duties neg|lected may bring on a &s;entence not much le&s;s &s;evere than crimes committed.</P>

<HEAD>PART OF THE SPEECH OF PUBLIUS SCIPIO TO THE ROMAN ARMY, BEFORE THE BATTLE OF THE TICIN.</HEAD>
<P>THAT you may not be unapprized, &s;oldiers, of what &s;ort of enemies you are about to encounter, or what is to be feared from them, I tell you they are the very &s;ame, whom, in a former war, you vanqui&s;hed both by land and &s;ea; the &s;ame from whom you took Sicily and Sardinia; and who have been th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e twenty years your tributaries.</P>
<P N="2">2. You will not, I pre&s;ume, march again&s;t the&s;e men with only that courage with which you are wont to face other enemies; but with a certain anger and indignation, &s;uch as you would feel if you &s;aw your &s;laves on a &s;udden ri&s;e up in arms again&s;t you.</P>
<P N="3">3. But you have heard, perhaps, that, though they are few in number, they are men of &s;tout hearts and robu&s;t bod|ies; heroes of &s;uch &s;trength and vigor as nothing is able to re&s;i&s;t. Mere effigies! nay, &s;hadows of men! wretches, emaciated with hunger and benumbed with cold! brui&s;ed
<PB N="118" REF="026674_0118_0FD156240AD740D8">
and battered to pieces among the rocks and craggy cliffs! their weapons broken, and their hor&s;es weak and foundered!</P>
<P N="4">4. Such are the cavalry, and &s;uch the infantry, with which you are going to contend; not enemies, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the frag|ments of enemies. There is nothing which I more appre|hend, than that it will be thought Hannibal was vanqui&s;hed by the Alps before we had any conflict with him.</P>
<P N="5">5. I need not be in any fear that you &s;hould &s;u&s;pect me of &s;aying the&s;e things merely to encourage you, while inwardly I have different &s;entiments. Have I ever &s;hown any inclination to avoid a conte&s;t with this tremendous Hannibal? and have I now met with him only by acci|dent and unawares? or am I come on purpo&s;e to challenge him to the combat?</P>
<P N="6">6. I would gladly try, whether the earth, within the&s;e twenty years, has brought forth a new kind of Carthageni|ans; or whether they be the &s;ame &s;ort of men who fought at the Aegates, and whom at Eryx you &s;uffered to redeem them&s;elves at eighteen denarii per head. Whether this Hannibal, for labors and journies, be as he would be thought, the rival of Hercules; or whether he be what his father left him, a tributary, a va&s;&s;al, a &s;lave to the Ro|man people.</P>
<P N="7">7. Did not the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his wicked deed at Sa|guntum torment him and make him de&s;perate, he would have &s;ome regard, if not to his conquered country, yet &s;ure|ly to his own family, to his father's memory, to the treaty written with Amilcar's own hand. We might have &s;tarv|ed them in Eryx; we might have pa&s;&s;ed into Africa with our victorious fleet, and in a few days have de&s;troyed Car|thage.</P>
<P N="8">8. At their humble &s;upplication, we pardoned them. We relea&s;ed them when they were clo&s;ely &s;hut up without a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping. We made peace with them when they were conquered. When they were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the African war, we con&s;idered them, and treated them as a people under our protection.</P>
<P N="9">9. And what is the return they make us for all the&s;e favors! Under the conduct of a hair-brained young man, they come hither to overturn our &s;tate, and lay wa&s;te our country.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="119" REF="026674_0119_0FD15626D7C92C20">10. I could wi&s;h, indeed, that it were not &s;o; and that the war we are now engaged in concerned our glory only, and not our pre&s;ervation. But the conte&s;t at pre&s;ent is not for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sicily and Sardinia, but of Italy it&s;elf. Nor is there behind us another army, which, if we &s;hould not prove the conquerors, may make head again&s;t our vic|torious enemies.</P>
<P N="11">11. There are no more Alps for them to pa&s;s, which might give us lei&s;ure to rai&s;e new forces. No, &s;oldiers; here you mu&s;t take your &s;tand, as if you were ju&s;t now before the walls of Rome. Let every one reflect, that he is now to defend, not his own per&s;on only, but his wife, his chil|dren, his helple&s;s infants.</P>
<P N="12">12. Yet, let not private con&s;iderations alone po&s;&s;e&s;s our minds. Let us remember that the eyes of the &s;enate and people of Rome are upon us; and that, as our force and courage &s;hall now prove, &s;uch will be the fortune of that city, and of the Roman empire.</P>

<HEAD>PART OF HANNIBAL'S SPEECH TO THE CARTHAGENIAN ARMY, ON THE SAME OCCASION.</HEAD>
<P>ON what &s;ide &s;oever I turn my eyes, I behold all full of courage and &s;trength. A veteran infantry; a mo&s;t gallant cavalry; you, my allies, mo&s;t faithful and val|iant; you, Carthagenians, whom, not only your country's cau&s;e, but the ju&s;te&s;t anger, impels to battle. The hope, the courage of a&s;&s;ailants, is always greater than that of tho&s;e who act upon the defen&s;ive.</P>
<P N="2">2. With ho&s;tile banners di&s;played, you are come down upon Italy. You bring the war. Grief, injuries, indig|nities, fire your minds, and &s;pur you forward to revenge. Fir&s;t, they demanded me; that I, your general, &s;hould be delivered up to them; next, all of you who had fought at the &s;iege of Saguntum; and we were to be put to death by excruciating tortures.</P>
<P N="3">3. Proud and cruel nation! Every thing mu&s;t be yours, and at your di&s;po&s;al! You are to pre&s;cribe to us with whom
<PB N="120" REF="026674_0120_0FD1562948F25FF0">
we are to make war, with whom to make peace! You are to &s;et us bounds; to &s;hut us up between hills and rivers; but you are not to ob&s;erve the limits which your&s;elves have fixed!</P>
<P N="4">4. "Pa&s;s not the Iberus." What next? "Touch not the Saguntines; Saguntum is upon the Iberus; move not a &s;tep towards that city." Is it a &s;mall matter, then, that you have deprived us of our ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Sicily and Sardinia? You would have Spain too!</P>
<P N="5">5. Well, we &s;hall yield Spain, and then&mdash;you will pa&s;s into Africa. <HI>Will</HI> pa&s;s, did I &s;ay? This very year, they ordered one of their con&s;uls into Africa, the other in|to Spain. No, &s;oldiers, there is nothing left for us but what we can vindicate with our &s;words.</P>
<P N="6">6. Come on, then. Be men. The Romans may, with more &s;afety, be cowards. They have their own country behind them; have places of refuge to flee to; and are &s;e|cure from danger in the roads thither. But for <HI>you,</HI> there is no middle fortune between death and victory. Let this be but well fixed in your minds; and, once again, I &s;ay you are <HI>conquerors.</HI></P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM DR. BELKNAP'S ADDRESS TO THE INHABITANTS OF NEW-HAMP|SHIRE, AT THE CLOSE OF HIS HISTORY OF THAT STATE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>CITIZENS OF NEW-HAMPSHIRE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING &s;pent above twenty years of my life with you, and pa&s;&s;ed through various &s;cenes of peace and war within that time; being per&s;onally acquainted with many of you, both in your public and private characters; and having an earne&s;t de&s;ire to promote your true intere&s;t, I tru&s;t you will not think me altogether unqualified to give you a few hints by way of advice.</P>
<P N="2">2. You are certainly a ri&s;ing State; your numbers are rapidly increa&s;ing; and your importance in the political &s;cale will be augmented, in proportion to your improving
<PB N="121" REF="026674_0121_0FD1562951DC8A50">
the natural advantages which your &s;ituation affords you, and to your cultivating the intellectual and moral powers of your&s;elves and your children.</P>
<P N="3">3. The fir&s;t article on which I would open my mind to you is that of <HI>education.</HI> Nature has been as bountiful to you as to any other people, in giving your children ge|nius and capacity; it is then your duty and your intere&s;t to cultivate their capacities, and render them &s;erviceable to them&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es and the community.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was the &s;aying of a great orator and &s;tate&s;man of antiquity, that "The lo&s;s which the Commonwealth &s;u&s;|tains, by a want of education, is like the lo&s;s which the year would &s;uffer by the de&s;truction of the &s;pring."</P>
<P N="5">5. If the bud be bla&s;ted, the tree will yield no fruit. If the &s;pringing corn be cut down, there will be no harve&s;t. So if the youth be ruined through a fault in their education, the community &s;u&s;tains a lo&s;s which cannot be repaired; "for it is too late to correct them when they are &s;poiled."</P>
<P N="6">6. Notwith&s;tanding the care of your legi&s;lators in en|acting laws, and en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">cing them by &s;evere penalties; not|with&s;tanding the wi&s;e and liberal provi&s;ion which is made by &s;ome towns, and &s;ome private gentlemen in the State; yet there is &s;till, in many places, "A great and criminal neglect of education."</P>
<P N="7">7. You are indeed a very con&s;iderable degree better, in this re&s;pect, than in the time of the late war; but yet much remains to be done. Great care ought to be taken, not only to provide a &s;upport for in&s;tructors of children and youth; but to be attentive in the choice of in&s;tructors; to &s;ee that they be men of good under&s;tanding, learning and morals; that they teach by their example as well as by their precepts; that they govern them&s;elves, and teach their pupils the art of &s;elf-government.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another &s;ource of improvement which I beg leave to recommend, is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ocial libraries. This is the ea&s;ie&s;t, the cheape&s;t and mo&s;t effectual mode of dif|fu&s;ing knowledge among the people. For the &s;um of &s;ix or eight dollars at once, and a &s;mall annual payment be|&s;ides, a man may be &s;upplied with the means of literary im|provement, during his life, and his children may inherit the ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="122" REF="026674_0122_0FD156295953F2A0">9. A few neighbors, joined together in &s;etting up a li|brary, and placing it under the care of &s;ome &s;uitable per&s;on, with a very few regulations, to prevent carele&s;sne&s;s and wa&s;te, may render the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to them&s;elves and to the community.</P>
<P N="10">10. Books may be much better pre&s;erved in this way, than if they belonged to individuals; and there is an ad|vantage in the &s;ocial intercour&s;e of per&s;ons who have read the &s;ame books, by their conver&s;ing on the &s;ubjects which have occurred in their reading, and communicating their ob&s;ervations one to another.</P>
<P N="11">11. From this mutual intercour&s;e another advantage may ari&s;e; for the per&s;ons who are thus a&s;&s;ociated may not only acquire but <HI>originate</HI> knowledge. By &s;tudying nature and the &s;ciences; by practi&s;ing arts, agriculture and manufactures, at the &s;ame time that they improve their minds in reading, they may be led to di&s;coveries and im|provements, original and beneficial; and being already formed into &s;ociety, they may diffu&s;e their knowledge, ripen their plans, correct their mi&s;takes, and promote the cau&s;e of &s;cience and humanity in a very con&s;iderable degree.</P>
<P N="12">12. The book of nature is always open to our view, and we may &s;tudy it at our lei&s;ure. "'Tis elder &s;cripture; writ by God's own hand." The earth, the air, the &s;ea, the rivers, the mountains, the rocks, the caverns, the ani|mal and vegetable tribes are fraught with in&s;truction. Na|ture is not half explored; and in what is partly known there are many my&s;teries, which time, ob&s;ervation and ex|perience mu&s;t unfold.</P>
<P N="13">13. Every &s;ocial library, among other books, &s;hould be furni&s;hed with tho&s;e of natural philo&s;ophy, botany, zoolo|gy, chymi&s;try, hu&s;bandry, geopraphy and a&s;tronomy; that inquiring minds may be directed in their inquiries; that they may &s;ee what is known and what &s;till remains to be di&s;covered; and that they may employ their lei&s;ure and their various opportunities in endeavoring to add to the &s;tock of &s;cience, and thus enrich the world with their ob|&s;ervations and improvements.</P>
<P N="14">14. Suffer me to add a few words on the u&s;e of <HI>&s;piritu|ous liquor,</HI> that bane of &s;ociety, that de&s;troye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of health, morals and property. Nature indeed has furni&s;hed her
<PB N="123" REF="026674_0123_0FD1562AE6A1D4E0">
vegetable productions with <HI>&s;pirit;</HI> but &s;he has &s;o combined it with other &s;ub&s;tances, that unle&s;s her work be tortured by fire, the &s;pirit is not &s;eparated, and cannot prove perni|cious. Why &s;hould this force be put on nature, to make her yield a noxious draught, when all her original prepara|tions are &s;alutary?</P>
<P N="15">15. The juice of the apple, the fermentation of barley, and the decoction of &s;pruce are amply &s;ufficient for the refre&s;hment of man, let his labor be ever &s;o &s;evere, and his per&s;piration ever &s;o expen&s;ive. Our forefathers, for many years after the &s;ettlement of the country, knew not the u&s;e of di&s;tilled &s;pirits.</P>
<P N="16">16. Malt was imported from England, and wine from the We&s;tern or Canary I&s;lands, with which they were re|fre&s;hed, before their own fields and orchards yielded them a &s;upply. An expedition was once undertaken again&s;t a nation of Indians, when there was but <HI>one pint</HI> of &s;trong water (as it was then called) in the whole army, and that was re&s;erved for the &s;ick; yet no complaint was made for want of refre&s;hment.</P>
<P N="17">17. Could we but return to the primitive manners of our ance&s;tors, in this re&s;pect, we &s;hould be free from many of the di&s;orders, both of body and mind, which are now experienced. The di&s;u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits would al&s;o tend to aboli&s;h the infamous traffic in &s;laves, by who&s;e labor this baneful material is procured.</P>
<P N="18">18. Divine Providence &s;eems to be preparing the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y for the de&s;truction of that dete&s;table commerce. The in|&s;urrections of the blacks in the We&s;t-Indies have already &s;pread de&s;olation over the mo&s;t fertile plantations, and great|ly rai&s;ed the price of tho&s;e commodities which we have been u&s;ed to import from thence.</P>
<P N="19">19. If we could check the con&s;umption of di&s;tilled &s;pir|its, and enter with vigor into the manufacture of maple &s;u|gars, of which our fore&s;ts would afford an ample &s;upply, the demand for We&s;t-India-productions might be dimini&s;hed; the plantations in the i&s;lands would not need fre&s;h recruits from Africa; the planters would treat with humanity their remaining blacks; the market for &s;laves would become le&s;s inviting; and the navigation which is now employed in
<PB N="124" REF="026674_0124_0FD1562BE54DAEC0">
the mo&s;t pernicious &s;pecies of commerce which ever di&s;|graced humanity, would be turned into &s;ome other channel.</P>
<P N="20">20. Were I to form a picture of happy &s;ociety, it would be a town con&s;i&s;ting of a due mixture of hills, vallies, and &s;treams of water. The land well fenced and cultivated; the roads and bridges in good repair; a decent inn for the refre&s;hment of travellers, and for public entertainments. The inhabitants mo&s;tly hu&s;bandmen; their wives and daughters dome&s;tic manufacturers; a &s;uitable proportion of handicraft workmen, and two or three traders; a phy&s;ician and lawyer, each of whom &s;hould have a farm for his &s;up|port.</P>
<P N="21">21. A clergyman of good under&s;tanding, of a candid di&s;po&s;ition and exemplary morals; not a metaphy&s;ical, nor a polemic, but a &s;erious and practical preacher. A &s;chool|ma&s;ter who &s;hould under&s;tand his bu&s;ine&s;s, and teach his pupils to govern them&s;elves. A &s;ocial library, annually in|crea&s;ing, and under good regulation.</P>
<P N="22">22. A club of &s;en&s;ible men, &s;eeking mutual improve|ment. A decent mu&s;ical &s;ociety. No intriguing politician, hor&s;e jockey, gambler or &s;ot; but all &s;uch characters treat|ed with contempt. Such a &s;ituation may be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t favorable to &s;ocial happine&s;s of any which this world can afford.</P>

<P>MISTAKE me not. I know how to value the &s;weet courte&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of life. Affability, attention, decorum of behavior, if they have not been ranked among the virtues, are certainly related to them, and have a pow|erful influence in promoting &s;ocial happine&s;s. I have rec|ommended them as well as your&s;elf. But I contend, and no &s;ophi&s;try &s;hall prevail upon me to give up this point, that, to be truly amiable, they mu&s;t proceed from goodne&s;s of heart.

<P>And did I not endeavor mo&s;t effectually to &s;erve my &s;on, by pointing out the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for a foreign amba&s;&s;ador, for which department I always de&s;igned him?

<SPEAKER>Cic.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; your conde&s;cen&s;ion was great indeed. You were the pander of your &s;on. You not only taught him the mean arts of di&s;&s;imulation, the petty tricks which degrade nobility; but you corrupted his principles, fomented his pa&s;&s;ions, and even pointed out objects for their gratification. You might have left the ta&s;k of teaching him fa&s;hionable vice, to a vicious world. Example, and the corrupt af|fections of human nature, will ever be capable of accom|pli&s;hing this unnatural purpo&s;e. But a parent, the guardian appointed by nature for an unin&s;tructed offspring introduced into a dangerous world, who him&s;elf takes upon him the office of &s;eduction, is a mon&s;ter indeed. I al&s;o had a &s;on. I was tenderly &s;olicitous for the right conduct of his education. I entru&s;ted him indeed to Cratippus at Athens; but, like you, I could not help tran&s;mitting in&s;tructions dic|tated by paternal love. Tho&s;e in&s;tructions are contained in my book of Offices, a book which has ever been cited by the world as a proof, to what a height the morality of the heathens was advanced without the light of revelation. I own, I feel a con&s;cious pride in it; not on account of the ability which it may di&s;play, but for the principles it teach|es, and the good, I flatter my&s;elf, it has diffu&s;ed. You did not indeed intend your in&s;tructions for the world; but as you gave them to a &s;on you loved, it may be concluded that you thought them true wi&s;dom, and withheld them on|ly becau&s;e they were contrary to the profe&s;&s;ions of the un|enlightened.

<HEAD>OF THE ELEPHANT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Elephant is not only the mo&s;t tractable, but the mo&s;t intelligent of animals; &s;en&s;ible of benefits, re|&s;entful of injuries, and endued even with a &s;en&s;e of glory.</P>
<P N="2">2. In India, they were once employed in the launching of &s;hips. One was directed to force a very large &s;hip into the water; the work proved &s;uperior to his &s;trength; his ma&s;ter, with a &s;arca&s;tic tone, bid the keeper take away this lazy bea&s;t and bring another; the poor animal in&s;tantly re|peated his efforts, fractured his &s;kull, and died on the &s;pot.</P>
<P N="3">3. In Delhi, an elephant pa&s;&s;ing along the &s;treets put his trunk into a taylor's &s;hop, where &s;everal people were at work; one of them pricked the end of it with a needle; the bea&s;t pa&s;&s;ed on; but, in the next dirty puddle, filled his trunk with water, returned to the &s;hop, and &s;purting ev|ery drop among the people who had offended him, &s;poiled their work.</P>
<P N="4">4. An elephant in Ad&s;meer, which often pa&s;&s;ed through the market, as he went by a certain herb woman, always received from her a mouthful of greens. At length he was &s;eized with one of his periodical fits of rage, broke his fet|ters, and running through the market, put the crowd to flight; among others, this woman, who, in her ha&s;te, for|got a little child &s;he had brought with her.</P>
<P N="5">5. The animal recollecting the &s;pot where his benefac|tre&s;s was wont to &s;it, took up the infant gently in his trunk, and placed it in &s;afety on a &s;tall before a neighboring hou&s;e. Another, in his madne&s;s, killed his governor; the wife &s;ee|ing the misfortune, took her two children and flung them before the elephant, &s;aying, "Now you have de&s;troyed their father, you may as well put an end to their lives and mine."</P>
<P N="6">6. He in&s;tantly &s;topped, relented, took the greate&s;t of the children, placed it on his neck, adopted it for his <HI>cor|nac</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="026674_0129_0FD156354C1552A0">
or governor, and never afterwards would permit any body el&s;e to mount him.</P>
<P N="7">7. A &s;oldier at Pondicherry, who was accu&s;tomed, whenever he received the portion that came to his &s;hare, to carry a certain quantity of it to one of the&s;e animals, having one day drank rather too freely, and finding him&s;elf pur|&s;ued by the guards, who were going to take him to pri&s;on, took refuge under the elephant's body, and fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P N="8">8. In vain did the guard try to force him from this a&s;ylum, as the elephant protected him with his trunk. The next morning the &s;oldier recovering from his drunken fit, &s;huddered with horror to find him&s;elf &s;tretched under the belly of this huge animal.</P>
<P N="9">9. The elephant, which without doubt perceived the man's embarra&s;&s;ment, care&s;&s;ed him with his trunk, in order to in&s;pire him with courage, and make him under&s;tand that he might now depart in &s;afety.</P>
<P N="10">10. A painter was de&s;irous of drawing the elephant which was kept in the menagerie at Ver&s;ailles in an uncommon at|titude, which was that of holding his trunk rai&s;ed up in the air with his mouth open. The painter's boy, in order to keep the animal in this po&s;ture, threw fruit into his mouth.</P>
<P N="11">11. But, as the lad frequently deceived him, and made an offer only of throwing him the fruit, he grew angry; and, as if he had known that the painter's intention of draw|ing him was the cau&s;e of the affront that was offered him, in&s;tead of revenging him&s;elf on the lad, he turned his re|&s;entment on the ma&s;ter, and taking up a quantity of water in his trunk, threw it on the paper on which the painter was drawing, and &s;poiled it.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF MR. WALPOLE IN THE BRIT|ISH PARLIAMENT IN OPPOSITION TO MR. PITT, LATE EARL OF CHATHAM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS unwilling to interrupt the cour&s;e of this debate while it was carried on with calmne&s;s and decency, by men who do not &s;uffer the ardor of oppo&s;ition to cloud

their rea&s;on, or tran&s;port them to &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the dignity of this a&s;&s;embly does not admit.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have hitherto deferred to an&s;wer the gentleman who declaimed again&s;t the bill with &s;uch fluency of rhetoric, and &s;uch vehemence of ge&s;ture; who charged the advocates for the expedients now propo&s;ed, with having no regard to any intero&s;t but their own, and with making laws only to con&s;ume paper; and threatened them with the defection of their adherents, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the lo&s;s of their influence, upon this new di&s;covery of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eir folly and ignorance.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor, Sir, do I now an&s;wer him for any other pur|po&s;e than to remind him how little the clamors of rage, and petulancy of invective, contribute to the purpo&s;es for which this a&s;&s;embly is called together; how little the di&s;covery of truth is promoted, and the &s;ecurity of the nation e&s;tabli&s;hed by pompous diction and theatrical emotions.</P>
<P N="4">4. Formidable &s;ounds and furious declamations, confi|dent a&s;&s;ertions, and lofty periods, may affect the young and unexperienced; and perhaps the gentleman may have con|tracted his habits of oratory by conver&s;ing more with tho&s;e of his own age than with &s;uch as have had more opportu|nities of acquiring knowledge, and more &s;ucce&s;sful methods of communicating their &s;entiments.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the heat of his temper, Sir, would &s;uffer him to attend to tho&s;e who&s;e age and long acquaintance with bu|&s;ine&s;s give them an indi&s;putable right to deference and &s;u|periority, he would learn, in time, to rea&s;on rather than de|claim, and to prefer ju&s;tne&s;s of argument, and an accurate knowledge of facts, to &s;ounding epithets and &s;plendid &s;uper|latives, which may di&s;turb the imagination for a moment, but leave no la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the mind.</P>
<P N="6">6. He will learn, Sir, that to accu&s;e and prove are ve|ry different, and that reproaches, un&s;upported by evidence, affect only the character of him who utters them. Excur|&s;ions of fancy and flights of oratory are indeed pardonable in young men, but in no other; and it would &s;urely con|tribute more, even to the purpo&s;e for which &s;ome gentle|men appear to &s;peak; that of depreciating the conduct of the admini&s;tration, to prove the inconveniences and inju&s;tice of this bill, than barely to a&s;&s;ert them, with whatever mag|nificence of language or appearance of zeal, hone&s;ty, or compa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. PITT'S ANSWER TO THE FORE|GOING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE atrocious crime of being a young man, which the honorable gentleman has, with &s;uch &s;pirit and decency, charged upon me, I &s;hall neither attempt to palliate nor deny; but content my&s;elf with wi&s;hing, that I may be one of tho&s;e who&s;e follies may cea&s;e with their youth, and not of that number who are ignorant in &s;pite of experience.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether youth can be imputed to any man as a re|proach, I will not, Sir, a&s;&s;ume the province of determin|ing; but &s;urely age may become ju&s;tly contemptible, if the opportunities which it brings have pa&s;&s;ed away without im|provement, and vice appears to prevail, when the pa&s;&s;ions have &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P N="3">3. The wretch, who, after having &s;een the con&s;equences of a thou&s;and errors, continues &s;till to blunder, and who&s;e age has only added ob&s;tinacy to &s;tupidity, is &s;urely the object of either abhorrence or contempt, and de&s;erves not that his grey head &s;hould &s;ecure him from in&s;ults.</P>
<P N="4">4. Much more, Sir, is he to be abhorred, who, as he has advanced in age, has receded from virtue, and becomes more wicked with le&s;s temptation; who pro&s;titutes him&s;elf for money which he cannot enjoy, and &s;pends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country.</P>
<P N="5">5. But youth, Sir, is not my only crime; I have been accu&s;ed of acting a theatrical part. A theatrical part may either imply &s;ome peculiarities of ge&s;ture, or a di&s;&s;imula|tion of my real &s;entiments, and an adoption of the opin|ions and language of another man.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, Sir, the charge is too trifling to be confuted, and de&s;erves only to be mentioned that it may be de&s;pi&s;ed. I am at liberty, like every other man, to u&s;e my own language; and though I may perhaps have &s;ome am|bition to plea&s;e this gentleman, I &s;hall not lay my&s;elf under any re&s;traint, not very &s;olicitou&s;ly copy his diction or his mien, however matured by age, or modelled by experience.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="132" REF="026674_0132_0FD1563BB102D830">7. If any man &s;hall, by charging me with theatrical be|havior, imply, that I utter any &s;entiments but my own, I &s;hall treat him as a calumniator and a villain; nor &s;hall any pro|tection &s;helter him from the treatment which he de&s;erves.</P>
<P N="8">8. I &s;hall, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, without &s;cruple, trample upon all tho&s;e forms with which wealth and dignity en|trench them&s;elves; nor &s;hall any thing but age re&s;train my re&s;entment. Age, which always brings one privilege, that of being in&s;olent and &s;upercilious without puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="9">9. But with regard, Sir, to tho&s;e whom I have offended, I am of opinion, that if I had acted a borrowed part, I &s;hould have avoided their cen&s;ure. The heat which offend|ed them is the ardor of conviction, and that zeal for the &s;ervice of my country, which neither hope nor fear &s;hall influence me to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P N="10">10. I will not &s;it unconcerned while my liberty is inva|ded, nor look in &s;ilence upon public robbery. I will exert my endeavors, at whatever hazard, to repel the aggre&s;&s;or and drag the thief to ju&s;tice, whoever may protect them in their villany, and whoever may partake of their plunder.</P>

<HEAD>STORY OF A SECOND JOSEPH.</HEAD>
<P>THE following relation proves, that incidents &s;omewhat &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the times of Jacob are &s;till re|newed in Egypt. In 1776, the plains of Syria were rav|aged by clouds of locu&s;ts, which devoured the corn to the very root.</P>
<P N="2">2. A famine followed, and a farmer near Dama&s;cus felt the effects of the general di&s;tre&s;s. To &s;upply the wants of a numerous family, he &s;old his cattle; which re&s;ource being &s;oon exhau&s;ted, the unhappy father, wretched at pre&s;ent, but fore&s;eeing greater wretchedne&s;s to come, pre&s;&s;ed by hun|ger, &s;old his in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry at Dama&s;cus.</P>
<P N="3">3. Led by the invi&s;ible hand of Providence, as formerly Tobias was by the angel, while he bargained for corn, lately arrived from Damietta, he heard &s;peak of the &s;ucce&s;s of Mourad Bey, who had entered Grand Cairo victorious, and in triumph.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="133" REF="026674_0133_0FD1563D1E672C30">4. The &s;hape, character, and origin of the warrior were de&s;cribed, and how he had ri&s;en from &s;lavery to power &s;u|preme. The a&s;toni&s;hed farmer found the de&s;cription ac|corded with a &s;on, who had been &s;tolen from him at twelve years old; hope palpitated in his heart, he ha&s;tened home with his provi&s;ions, told his family what he had heard, and determined immediately to depart for Egypt.</P>
<P N="5">5. His weeping wife and &s;ons offered up prayers for his &s;afe return. Going to the port of Alexandretta, he em|barked there, and came to Damietta. One continued fear tormented him; his &s;on, for&s;aking the religion of his fa|thers, had embraced Mahometani&s;m; and now, &s;urrounded as he was by &s;plendor, would be acknowledge his parents?</P>
<P N="6">6. The thought lay heavy on his heart; yet, the wi&s;h to &s;natch his family from all the horrors of famine; the hope of finding a long lamented &s;on, gave him fortitude. He continued his journey, came to the capital, repaired to the palace of Mourad, applied to the officers of the prince, and mo&s;t ardently &s;olicited admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">7. His dre&s;s and appearance be&s;poke poverty and mi&s;|fortune, and were poor recommendations; but his great age, &s;o re&s;pectable in the Ea&s;t, pleaded in his behalf. One of the attendants went to the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and told him an aged man, apparently mi&s;erable, reque&s;ted an audience.</P>
<P N="8">8. Let him enter, replied Mourad; and the farmer proceeded, with trembling &s;teps, over the rich carpet which be&s;pread the hall of the Divan, and approached the Bey, who reclined on a &s;ofa, embroidered with &s;ilk and gold. Crouding &s;en&s;ations deprived him of the u&s;e of &s;peech.</P>
<P N="9">9. At la&s;t, after attentively looking, the voice of nature vanqui&s;hing fear, he fell, and embracing his knees, exclaim|ed, <HI>You are my &s;on!</HI> The Bey rai&s;ed him, endeavored to recollect, and, after explanation, finding him to be his fa|ther, made him &s;it down by his &s;ide, and care&s;&s;ed him mo&s;t affectionately.</P>

<HEAD>THE TEST OF GOODNESS.</HEAD>
<P>REAL goodne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in doing good to our enemies. Of this truth the following apologue may &s;erve for an illu&s;tration. A certain father of a family, ad|vanced in years, being de&s;irous of &s;ettling his worldly mat|ters, divided his property between his three &s;ons.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nothing now remains, &s;aid he to them, but a dia|mond of great value; this I have determined to appropriate to whichever of you &s;hall, within three months, perform the be&s;t actions.</P>
<P N="3">3. His three &s;ons accordingly departed different ways, and returned by the limited time. On pre&s;enting them|&s;elves before their judge, the elde&s;t thus began.</P>
<P N="4">4. Father, &s;aid he, during my ab&s;ence, I found a &s;tranger &s;o circum&s;tanced, that he was under a nece&s;&s;ity of entru&s;ting me with the whole of his fortune.</P>
<P N="5">5. He had no written &s;ecurity from me, nor could he po&s;&s;ibly bring any proof, any evidence whatever of the de|po&s;it. Yet I faithfully returned to him every &s;hilling. Was there not &s;omething commendable in this action?</P>
<P N="6">6. Thou ha&s;t done what was incumbent upon thee to do, my &s;on, replied the old man. The man who could have acted otherways were unworthy to live; for hone&s;ty is a duty; thy action is an action of ju&s;tice, not of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="138" REF="026674_0138_0FD15648F430F258">7. On this, the &s;econd &s;on advanced. In the cour&s;e of my travels, &s;aid he, I came to a lake in which I beheld a child &s;truggling with death; I plunged into it and &s;aved his life in the pre&s;ence of a number of the neighboring villagers, all of whom can atte&s;t the truth of what I a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P N="8">8. It was well done (interrupted the old man); you have only obeyed the dictates of humanity. At length the younge&s;t of the three came forward.</P>
<P N="9">9. I happened, &s;aid he, to meet my mortal enemy, who having bewildered him&s;elf in the dead of night, had imper|ceptibly fallen a&s;leep upon the brink of a frightful precipice. The lea&s;t motion would infallibly have plunged him head|long into the aby&s;s; and though his life was in my hands, yet with every nece&s;&s;ary precaution, I awaked him, and remo|ved him from his danger.</P>
<P N="10">10. Ah, my &s;on! exclaimed the venerable good man with tran&s;port, while he pre&s;&s;ed him to his heart; to thee belongs the diamond; well ha&s;t thou de&s;erved it.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF MOUNT AETNA.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no point on the &s;urface of this globe, which unites &s;o many awful and &s;ublime objects, as the &s;ummit of mount Aetna. The immen&s;e elevation from the &s;urface of the earth, drawn as it were to a &s;ingle point, without any neighboring mountain for the &s;en&s;es and imagi|nation to re&s;t upon, and recover from their a&s;toni&s;hment in their way down to the world:</P>
<P N="2">2. This point or pinnacle, rai&s;ed on the brink of a bot|tomle&s;s gulph, as old as the world, often di&s;charging rivers of fire, and throwing out burning rocks, with a noi&s;e which &s;hakes the whole i&s;land:</P>
<P N="3">3. Add to this, the unbounded extent of the pro&s;pect, comprehending the greate&s;t diver&s;ity, and the mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenery in nature; with the ri&s;ing &s;un, advancing in the Ea&s;t, to illuminate the wondrous &s;cene.</P>
<P N="4">4. The whole atmo&s;phere by degrees kindled up, and &s;howed dimly and faintly the boundle&s;s pro&s;pect around. Both &s;ea and land looked dark and confu&s;ed, as if only
<PB N="139" REF="026674_0139_0FD1564AE5336448">
emerging from their original chaos; and light and dark|ne&s;s &s;eemed &s;till undivided; till the morning, by degrees advancing, completed the &s;eparation.</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;tars are extingui&s;hed, and the &s;hades di&s;appear. The fore&s;ts, which but now &s;eemed black and bottomle&s;s gulphs, from whence no ray was reflected to &s;how their form or colors, appear a new creation ri&s;ing to the &s;ight, catching life and beauty from every increa&s;ing beam.</P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;cene &s;till enlarges, and the horizon &s;eems to widen and expand it&s;elf on all &s;ides; till the &s;un, like the great Creator, appears in the Ea&s;t, and with his pla&s;tic ray completes the mighty &s;cene.</P>
<P N="7">7. All appears enchantment; and it is with difficulty we can believe we are &s;till on earth. The &s;en&s;es, unac|cu&s;tomed to the &s;ublimity of &s;uch a &s;cene, are bewildered and confounded; and it is not till after &s;ome time, that they are capable of &s;eparating and judging of the objects which compo&s;e it.</P>
<P N="8">8. The body of the &s;un is &s;een ri&s;ing from the ocean, immen&s;e tracts both of &s;ea and land intervening; the i&s;lands of Lipari, Panari, Alicudi, Strombolo, and Volca|no, with their &s;moking &s;ummits, appear under your feet; and you look down on the whole of Sicily as on a map; and can trace every river through all its windings, from its &s;ource to its mouth.</P>
<P N="9">9. The view is ab&s;olutely boundle&s;s on every &s;ide; nor is there any one object within the circle of vi&s;ion, to inter|rupt it; &s;o that the &s;ight is every where lo&s;t in the im|men&s;ity.</P>
<P N="10">10. The circumference of the vi&s;ible horizon on the top of Aetna cannot be le&s;s than 2000 miles. At Malta, which is nearly 200 miles di&s;tant, they perceive all the ir|ruptions from the &s;econd region; and that i&s;land is often di&s;covered from about one half of the elevation of the mountain; &s;o that at the whole elevation, the horizon mu&s;t extend to nearly double that di&s;tance.</P>
<P N="11">11. But this is by much too va&s;t for our &s;en&s;es, not intended to gra&s;p &s;o boundle&s;s a &s;cene. I find by &s;ome of the Sicilian authors, that the African coa&s;t, as well as that of Nap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, with many of its i&s;lands, has been di&s;covered from the top of Aetna. Of this, however, we cannot boa&s;t, though we can very well believe it.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="140" REF="026674_0140_0FD1564C2FF7A5D8">12. But the mo&s;t beautiful part of the &s;cene is certainly the mountain it&s;elf, the i&s;land of Sicily, and the numerous i&s;lands lying round it. All the&s;e, by a kind of magic in vi&s;|ion, &s;eem as if they were brought clo&s;e round the &s;kirts of Aetna; the di&s;tances appearing reduced to nothing.</P>
<P N="13">13. The pre&s;ent crater of the volcano is a circle of about three miles and a half in circumference. It goes &s;helving down on each &s;ide, and forms a regular hollow, like a va&s;t amphitheatre.</P>
<P N="14">14. From many places of this &s;pace, i&s;&s;ue volumes of &s;moke, which, being much heavier than the circumambient air, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing in it, as &s;moke generally does, rolls down the &s;ide of the mountain like a torrent, till coming to that part of the atmo&s;phere of the &s;ame &s;pecific gravity with it&s;elf, it &s;hoots off horizontally, and forms a large tract in the air, according to the direction of the wind.</P>
<P N="15">15. The crater is &s;o hot, that it is very dangerous, if not impo&s;&s;ible to go down into it. Be&s;ides, the &s;moke is very incommodious; and, in many places, the &s;urface is &s;o &s;oft, that there have been in&s;tances of people's &s;inking down into it, and paying for their temerity with their lives.</P>
<P N="16">16. Near the centre of the crater is the great mouth of the volcano. And when we reflect on the immen&s;ity of its depth, the va&s;t caverns whence &s;o many lavas have i&s;&s;u|ed; the force of its internal fire, &s;ufficient to rai&s;e up tho&s;e lavas to &s;o great a height; the boiling of the matter, the &s;haking of the mountain, the explo&s;ions of flaming rocks, &amp;c. we mu&s;t allow, that the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic imagination, in the mid&s;t of all its terrors, can hardly form an idea more dreadful.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM MR. JOHN Q. ADAMS'S ORATION, DELIVERED AT BOSTON,
<DATE>JU|LY 4, 1793.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>AMERICANS! let us pau&s;e for a moment to con&s;ider the &s;ituation of our country, at that eventful day when our national exi&s;tence commenced. In the full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of all tho&s;e prerogatives for which you then dared to adventure upon "all the varieties of untried being," the calm and &s;ettled moderation of the mind is &s;carcely competent to conceive the tone of heroi&s;m, to which the &s;ouls of freemen were exalted in that hour of perilous magnanimity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Seventeen times has the &s;un, in the progre&s;s of his annual revolutions, diffu&s;ed his prolific radiance over the plains of Independent America. Millions of hearts which then palpitated with the rapturous glow of patrio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;m, have
<PB N="144" REF="026674_0144_0FD156566C9F5AE8">
already been tran&s;lated to brighter worlds; to the abodes of more than mortal freedom. Other millions have ari&s;en to receive from their parents and benefactors, the ine&s;timable recompen&s;e of their atchievements.</P>
<P N="3">3. A large proportion of the audience, who&s;e benevo|lence is at this moment li&s;tening to the &s;peaker of the day, like him were at that period too little advanced beyond the thre&s;hold of life to partake of the divine enthu&s;ia&s;m which in&s;pired the American bo&s;om; which prompted her voice to proclaim defiance to the thunders of Britain; which con|&s;ecrated the banners of her armies; and finally erected the holy temple of American Liberty, over the tomb of de|parted tyranny.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is from tho&s;e who have already pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life; it is from you, ye venerable a&s;&s;ertors of the rights of mankind, that we are to be informed, what were the feel|ings which &s;wayed within your brea&s;ts, and impelled you to action; when, like the &s;tripling of I&s;rael, with &s;carce a weapon to attack, and without a &s;hield for your defence, you met, and, undi&s;mayed, engaged with the gigantic great|ne&s;s of the Briti&s;h power.</P>
<P N="5">5. Untutored in the di&s;graceful &s;cience of human butch|ery; de&s;titute of the fatal materials which the ingenuity of man has combined, to &s;harpen the &s;cythe of death; un&s;up|ported by the arm of any friendly alliance, and unfortified again&s;t the powerful a&s;&s;aults of an unrelenting enemy, you did not he&s;itate at that moment, when your coa&s;ts were in|fe&s;ted by a formidable fleet, when your territories were invaded by a numerous and veteran army, to pronounce the &s;entence of eternal &s;eparation from Britain, and to throw the gauntlet at a power, the terror of who&s;e recent triumphs was almo&s;t co-exten&s;ive with the earth.</P>
<P N="6">6. The intere&s;ted and &s;elfi&s;h propen&s;ities, which, in times of pro&s;perous tranquillity have &s;uch powerful dominion over the heart, were all expelled, and in their &s;tead, the public virtues, the &s;pirit of per&s;onal devotion to the com|mon cau&s;e, a contempt of every danger in compari&s;on with the &s;ub&s;erviency of the country, had a&s;&s;umed an unlimited control.</P>
<P N="7">7. The pa&s;&s;ion for the public had ab&s;orbed all the re&s;t; as the glorious luminary of heaven extingui&s;hes in a flood

of refulgence the twinkling &s;plendor of every inferior plan|et. Tho&s;e of you, my countrymen, who were actors in tho&s;e intere&s;ting &s;cenes, will be&s;t know, how feeble and impotent is the language of this de&s;cription to expre&s;s the impa&s;&s;ioned emotions of the &s;oul, with which you were then agitated.</P>
<P N="7">7. Yet it were inju&s;tice to conclude from thence, or from the greater prevalence of private and per&s;onal motives in the&s;e days of calm &s;erenity, that your &s;ons have degen|erated from the virtues of their fathers. Let it rather be a &s;ubject of plea&s;ing reflection to you that the generous and di&s;intere&s;ted energies, which you were &s;ummoned to di&s;|play, are permitted by the bountiful indulgence of Heaven to remain latent in the bo&s;oms of your children.</P>
<P N="8">8. From the pre&s;ent pro&s;perous appearance of our pub|lic affairs, we may admit a rational hope that our country will have no occa&s;ion to require of us tho&s;e extraordinary and heroic exertions which it was your fortune to exhibit.</P>
<P N="9">9. But from the common ver&s;atility of all human de&s;ti|ny, &s;hould the pro&s;pect hereafter darken, and the clouds of public misfortune thicken to a tempe&s;t; &s;hould the voice of our country's calamity ever call us to her relief, we &s;olemn|ly affirm by the precious memory of the &s;ages who toiled, and of the heroes who bled in her defence, that we will prove our&s;elves not unworthy of the prize which they &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed; that we will act as the faithful di&s;ciples of tho&s;e who &s;o magnanimou&s;ly taught us the in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on of republican virtue.</P>

<HEAD>ON KNOWING THE WORLD AT AN EARLY AGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE knowledge of the world, in its com|prehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e, is a knowledge greatly to be de&s;ired. To under&s;tand the human heart, to know human manners, laws, languages, and in&s;titutions of every kind, and in various na|tions, and to be able to reflect on all the&s;e with moral and political improvement, is an attainment worthy of the great|e&s;t &s;tate&s;man and the wi&s;e&s;t philo&s;opher.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="146" REF="026674_0146_0FD12B0D7A164510">2. But there is a knowledge of the world of a very in|ferior kind, but which many parents value at a high price. Greek and Latin are always mentioned with contempt, on a compari&s;on with this. In compliance with cu&s;tom, in|deed, and to get him out of the way, the boy is placed at &s;chool; but the knowledge to be gained there is little e&s;teemed by the empty votaries of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P N="3">3. Men and things, not words, are magi&s;terially pointed out as the proper objects of &s;tudy, by tho&s;e who know little of men, things, or words. It is not the knowledge of books, (&s;ay they) which he is to pur&s;ue, but the knowledge of the world; ignorant that the knowledge of books is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to gain a valuable knowledge of the world.</P>
<P N="4">4. The parents, who give &s;uch directions to their chil|dren, are them&s;elves merely people of the world, as it is called; per&s;ons for the mo&s;t part of very moderate under|&s;tandings, who have never made any &s;olid improvements in learning, and, con&s;equently, never felt its plea&s;ures, or its advantages.</P>
<P N="5">5. They have perhaps rai&s;ed them&s;elves by dint of worldly policy, by the little arts of &s;imulation and di&s;&s;im|ulation; and, having &s;een the effects of dre&s;s, addre&s;s, and an attention to exterior accompli&s;hments, but at the &s;ame time being totally unacquainted with real and &s;olid attain|ments, they are naturally led to wi&s;h to give their children the mo&s;t u&s;eful education, which, according to their ideas, is a knowledge of the world.</P>
<P N="6">6. But what is this knowledge of the world? A knowl|edge of its follies and vices; a knowledge of them at a time of life, when they will not appear in their true light, con|temptible in them&s;elves, and the &s;ources of mi&s;ery; but flattering and plea&s;urable. To &s;ee the&s;e at a boyi&s;h age, before the mind is properly prepared, will not cau&s;e an ab|horrence, but an imitation of them.</P>
<P N="7">7. To introduce boys to &s;cenes of immoral and inde|cent behavior is to educate them in vice, and to give the young mind a foul &s;tain, which it will never lo&s;e. And yet I have known parents in the metropolis &s;uffer boys of fourteen or fifteen to roam where&s;oever they plea&s;ed; to frequent theatres, and other places of public diver&s;ions, by them&s;elves; to return home late at night; and all this with
<PB N="147" REF="026674_0147_0FD1565DD5221860">
plenty of money, and without giving any account of the manner of con&s;uming that or their time.</P>
<P N="8">8. The parents were plea&s;ed with their &s;on's proficiency in the knowledge of the world; the &s;on was plea&s;ed with liberty. All for a &s;hort time, went on to their mutual &s;at|isfaction. But after a few years, a &s;ad rever&s;e u&s;ually ap|peared. The boy became a &s;pendthrift and a debauchee; alienated his father's affections by incurring debt, and ruin|ed his con&s;titution by every &s;pecies of exce&s;s.</P>
<P N="9">9. What remained after his money and his health were di&s;&s;ipated? No learning, no reli&s;h for the works of literary ta&s;te. The &s;pring of life, when the &s;eeds of the&s;e &s;hould have been &s;own, was employed in another manner. Noth|ing remained but a wretched and a painful old age, devoted to cards, dice, and illiberal conviviality.</P>
<P N="10">10. He, who is attending to his books, and collecting ideas which will one day render him a ble&s;&s;ing and an hon|or to all with whom he is connected, will appear dull, awk|ward, and unengaging to many, in compari&s;on with the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ipling, who has been plunged into vice and di&s;&s;ipation before he knows the meaning of the words.</P>
<P N="11">11. The reception which the latter meets with in com|pany gives him additional &s;pirits; and the poor parents u&s;u|ally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iumph <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hile in the con&s;cious &s;uperiority of their judgment. In four or five years, they commonly &s;ee and feel the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> their folly.</P>
<P N="12">12. Their conduct, as it often undoubtedly proceeds from ignorance, is to be compa&s;&s;ionated; but if ever it ari&s;e from affectation of &s;ingularity, pride, vicious principles, or carele&s;sne&s;s concerning their offspring, it de&s;erves the &s;e|vere&s;t reprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is obvious to ob&s;erve in the world multitudes of bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dle&s;s boys a&s;&s;uming ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of manhood, and practi&s;ing manly vices, to obtain a title to the appellation of <HI>men.</HI> The pre&s;ent age abounds with &s;uch examples.</P>
<P N="14">14. A mo&s;t fatal mi&s;take is made by parents of all cla&s;&s;|es in the pre&s;ent age. Many of them &s;eem to think vice and irregularity the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ks of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, in a boy; and that innocence, mode&s;ty, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uperiors, appli|cation to &s;tudy, and to every thing laudable, are the &s;igns of

<P N="15">15. Hence it happens, that their offspring frequently prove a &s;courge to them, and that they feel that &s;ting, which, to u&s;e Shake&s;peare's expre&s;&s;ion, is &s;harper than a &s;erpent's tooth; the &s;ting inflicted by a thankle&s;s, an immoral, an ignorant, an extravagant, and an infidel child.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF POCAHONTAS.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS they who are not particularly ac|quainted with the hi&s;tory of Virginia, may be ignorant that Pocahontas was the protectre&s;s of the Engli&s;h, and often f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned them from the cruelty of her father.</P>
<P N="2">2. She was but twelve years old, when Captain Smith, the brave&s;t, the mo&s;t intelligent, and the mo&s;t humane of the fir&s;t coloni&s;ts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll into the hands of the &s;avages. He already under&s;tood their language, had traded with them &s;everal times, and often appea&s;ed the quarrels between the Europeans and them. Often had he been obliged al&s;o to fight them, and to puni&s;h their perfidy.</P>
<P N="3">3. At length, however, under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of commerce, he was drawn into an ambu&s;h, and the only two compan|ions who accompanied him, fell before his eyes; but though alone, by his dexterity he extricated him&s;elf from the troop which &s;urrounded him; until, unfortunately, ima|gining he could &s;ave him&s;elf by cro&s;&s;ing a mora&s;s, he &s;tuck fa&s;t, &s;o that the &s;avages, again&s;t whom he had no means of defending him&s;elf, at la&s;t took and bound him, and con|ducted him to Powhatan.</P>
<P N="4">4. The king was &s;o proud of having Captain Smith in his power, that he &s;ent him in triumph to all the tributary princes, and ordered that he &s;hould be &s;plendidly treated, till he returned to &s;uffer that death which was prepared for him.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fatal moment at la&s;t arrived. Captain Smith was laid upon the hearth of the &s;avage king, and his head placed upon a large &s;tone to receive the &s;troke of death; when Pocahontas, the younge&s;t and darling daughter of
<PB N="149" REF="026674_0149_0FD156609ED07D20">
Powhatan, threw her&s;elf upon his body, cla&s;ped him in her arms, and declared, that if the cruel &s;entence was execu|ted, the fir&s;t blow &s;hould fall on her.</P>
<P N="6">6. All &s;avages (ab&s;olute &s;overeigns and tyrants not ex|cepted) are invariably more affected by the tears of infancy, than the voice of humanity. Powhatan could not re&s;i&s;t the tears and prayers of his daughter.</P>
<P N="7">7. Captain Smith obtained his life, on condition of pay|ing for his ran&s;om a certain quantity of mu&s;kets, powder, and iron uten&s;ils; but how were they to be obtained? They would neither permit him to return to James-Town, nor let the Engli&s;h know where he was, le&s;t they &s;hould de|mand him &s;word in hand.</P>
<P N="8">8. Captain Smith, who was as &s;en&s;ible as courageous, &s;aid, that if Powhatan would permit one of his &s;ubjects to carry to James Town a leaf which he took from his pocket|book, he &s;hould find under a tree, at the day and hour ap|pointed, all the articles demanded for his ran&s;om.</P>
<P N="9">9. Powhatan con&s;ented; but without having much faith in his pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mi&s;es, believing it to be only an artifice of the Captain to prolong his life. But he had written on the leaf a few lines, &s;ufficient to give an account of his &s;ituation. The me&s;&s;enger returned. The king &s;ent to the place fixed up|on, and was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed to find every thing which had been demanded.</P>
<P N="10">10. Powhatan could not conceive this mode of tran&s;|mitting thoughts; and Captain Smith was henceforth look|ed upon as a great magician, to whom they could not &s;how too much re&s;pect. He left the &s;avages in this opinion, and ha&s;tened to return home.</P>
<P N="11">11. Two or three years after, &s;ome fre&s;h differences ari&s;ing amid&s;t them and the Engli&s;h, Powhatan, who no longer though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them &s;orcerers, but &s;till feared their power, laid a horrid plan to get rid of them altogether. His pro|ject was to attack them in profound peace, and cut the throats of the whole colony.</P>
<P N="12">12. The night of this intended con&s;piracy, Pocahontas took advantage of the ob&s;curity; and in a terrible &s;torm which kept the &s;avages in their tents, e&s;caped from her fa|ther's hou&s;e, advi&s;ed the Engli&s;h to be on their guard, but conjured them to &s;pare her family; to appear ignorant of
<PB N="150" REF="026674_0150_0FD15662C524C9A8">
the intelligence &s;he had given, and terminate all their differ|ences by a new treaty.</P>
<P N="13">13. It would be tedious to relate all the &s;ervices which this angel of peace rendered to both nations. I &s;hall only add, that the Engli&s;h, I know not from what motives, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> certainly again&s;t all faith and equity, thought proper to car|ry her off. Long and bitterly did &s;he deplore her fate; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd the only con&s;olation &s;he had was Captain Smith, in whom &s;he found a &s;econd father.</P>
<P N="14">14. She was treated with great re&s;pect, and married to a planter by the name of Rolfe, who &s;oon after took her to England. This was in the reign of James the Fir&s;t; and it is &s;aid, that this monarch, pedantic and ridiculous in every point, was &s;o infatuated with the prerogatives of royalty, that he expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;plea&s;ure, that one of his &s;ubjects &s;hould dare to marry the daughter even of a &s;avage king.</P>
<P N="15">15. It will not perhaps be difficult to decide on this oc|ca&s;ion, whether it was the &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age king who derived honor from finding him&s;elf placed upon a level with the European prince, or the Engli&s;h monarch, who by his pride and prejudices reduced him&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf to a level with the chief of the &s;avages.</P>
<P N="16">16. Be that as it will, Captain Smith, who had return|ed to London before the arrival of Pocahontas, was ex|tremely happy to &s;ee her again; but dared not treat her with the &s;ame familiarity as at James-Town. As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw him, &s;he threw her&s;elf into his arms, calling him her father; but finding that he neither returned her care&s;&s;|es with equal warmth, nor the endearing title of daughter, &s;he turned a&s;ide her head and wept bitterly; and it was a long time before they could obtain a &s;ingle word from her.</P>
<P N="17">17. Captain Smith inquired &s;everal times what could be the cau&s;e of her affliction. "What! &s;aid &s;he, did I not &s;ave thy life in America? When I was torn from the arms of my father, and conducted among&s;t thy friends, did&s;t thou not promi&s;e to be a father to me? Did<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t thou not a&s;&s;ure me, that if I went into thy country, thou would&s;t be my father, and that I &s;hould be thy daughter? Thou ha&s;t deceived me, and behold me, now here, a &s;tranger and an orphan."</P>
<P N="18">18. It was not difficult for the Captain to make his peace with this charming creature, whom he tenderly loved.
<PB N="151" REF="026674_0151_0FD156682EC82E58">
He pre&s;ented her to &s;everal people of the fir&s;t quality; but never dared to take her to court, from which, however, &s;he received &s;everal favors.</P>
<P N="19">19. After a re&s;idence of &s;everal years in England, an example of virtue and piety, and attachment to her hu&s;|band, &s;he died, as &s;he was on the point of embarking for America.

<P N="5"><PB N="152" REF="026674_0152_0FD1566A23676E48">5. So true is this, my countrymen, that I have, my&s;elf, known tho&s;e who have been cho&s;en con&s;uls, begin then to read the hi&s;tory of their own country, of which, till that time, they were totally ignorant; that is, they fir&s;t obtained the employment, and then bethought them&s;elves of the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for the proper di&s;charge of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. I &s;ubmit to your judgment, Romans, on which &s;ide the advantage lies, when a compari&s;on is made between pa|trician haughtine&s;s and plebeian experience. The very ac|tions which they have only read, I have partly &s;een, and partly my&s;elf achieved. What they know by reading, I know by action. They are plea&s;ed to &s;light my mean birth; I de&s;pi&s;e their mean characters.</P>
<P N="7">7. Want of birth and fortune is the objection again&s;t <HI>me;</HI> want of per&s;onal worth, again&s;t <HI>them.</HI> But are not all men of the &s;ame &s;pecies? What can make a difference be|tween one man and another, but the endowments of the mind? For my part, I &s;hall always look upon the brave&s;t man as the noble&s;t man.</P>
<P N="8">8. If the patricians have rea&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e me, let them likewi&s;e de&s;pi&s;e their ance&s;tors, who&s;e nobility was the fruit of their virtue. Do they envy the honors be&s;towed upon me? let them envy, likewi&s;e, my labo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, my ab&s;tinence, and the dangers I have undergone for my country, by which I have acquired them.</P>
<P N="9">9. But tho&s;e worthle&s;s men lead &s;uch a life of inactivity, as if they de&s;pi&s;ed any honors you can be&s;tow; while they a&s;pire to honors as if they had de&s;erved them by the mo&s;t indu&s;trious virtue. They lay claim to the rewards of activ|ity, for their having enjoyed the plea&s;ures of luxury. Yet none can be more lavi&s;h than they are in prai&s;e of their an|ce&s;tors.</P>
<P N="10">10. And they imagine they honor them&s;elves by celebra|ting their forefathers; whereas they do the very contrary; for, as much as their ance&s;tors were di&s;tingui&s;hed for their virtues, &s;o much are they di&s;graced by their vices.</P>
<P N="11">11. The glory of ance&s;tors ca&s;ts a light, indeed, upon their po&s;terity; but it only &s;erves to &s;how what the de|&s;cendants are. It alike exhibits to public view their degen|eracy and their worth. I own I cannot boa&s;t of the deeds of my forefathers; but I hope I may an&s;wer the cavils of

<P N="13">13. He has no &s;tatues, they cry, of his family. He can trace no venerable line of ance&s;tors. What then? is it matter of more prai&s;e to di&s;grace one's illu&s;trious ance&s;|tors, than to become illu&s;trious by one's own good behavior?</P>

<HEAD>FRATERNAL AFFECTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, the Portugue&s;e carracks failed from Li&s;bon to Goa, a very great, rich, and flouri&s;hing colony of that nation in the Ea&s;t-Indies. There were no le&s;s than twelve hundred &s;ouls, mariners, pa&s;&s;engers, prie&s;ts, and friars, on board one of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P N="2">2. The beginning of their voyage was pro&s;perous; they had doubled the &s;outhern extremity of the great continent of Africa, called the Cape of Good Hope, and were &s;teer|ing their cour&s;e Northea&s;t, to the great continent of India, when &s;ome gentlemen on board, who, having &s;tudied geog|raphy and navigation, found in the latitude in which they were then &s;ailing, a large ridge of rocks laid down in their &s;ea-charts.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="154" REF="026674_0154_0FD1566D493DD840">3. They no &s;ooner made this di&s;covery, than they ac|quainted the captain of the &s;hip with the affair, de&s;iring him to communicate the &s;ame to the pilot; which reque&s;t he immediately granted, recommended him to lie by in the night, and &s;lacken &s;ail by day, until they &s;hould be pa&s;t the danger.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is a cu&s;tom always among the Portugue&s;e ab&s;o|lutely to commit the &s;ailing part, or the navigation of the ve&s;&s;el to the pilot, who is an&s;werable with his head for the &s;afe conduct or carriage of the king's &s;hips, or tho&s;e belong|ing to private traders; and he is under no manner of di|rection from the captain, who commands in every other re&s;pect.</P>
<P N="5">5. The pilot being one of tho&s;e &s;elf-&s;ufficient men, who think every hint given them from others in the way of their profe&s;&s;ion derogatory from their under&s;tandings, took as an affront to be taught his art, and in&s;tead of complying with the captain's reque&s;t, actually crowded more &s;ail than the ve&s;&s;el had carried before.</P>
<P N="6">6. They had not &s;ailed many hours, when, ju&s;t about the dawn of day, a terrible di&s;a&s;ter befel them, which would have been prevented if they had lain by. The &s;hip &s;truck upon a rock. I leave to the reader's imagination, what a &s;cene of horror this dreadful accident mu&s;t occa&s;ion among twelve hundred per&s;ons, all in the &s;ame inevitable danger; beholding, with fearful a&s;toni&s;hment, that in&s;tantaneous death which now &s;tared them in the face.</P>
<P N="7">7. In this di&s;tre&s;s, the captain ordered the pinnace to be launched, into which, having to&s;&s;ed a &s;mall quantity of bi&s;cuit, and &s;ome boxes of marmalade, he jumped in him|&s;elf, with nineteen others, who, with their &s;words, prevented the coming in of any more, le&s;t the boat &s;hould &s;ink.</P>
<P N="8">8. In this condition they put off into the great Indian ocean, without a compa&s;s to &s;teer by, or any fre&s;h water but what might fall f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the heavens, who&s;e mercy alone could deliver them. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they had rowed four days in this mi&s;erable condition, the captain, who had been for &s;ome time very &s;ick and weak, died.</P>
<P N="9">9. This added, if po&s;&s;ible, to their mi&s;ery; for as they now fell into confu&s;ion, every one would govern, and none would obey. This obliged them to elect one of their own
<PB N="155" REF="026674_0155_0FD1566EA0429350">
company to command them, who&s;e orders they implicitly agreed to follow. This per&s;on propo&s;ed to the company to draw lots, and to ca&s;t every fourth man overboard; as their &s;mall &s;tock of provi&s;ions was &s;o far &s;pent, as not to be able at a very &s;hort allowance to &s;u&s;tain life above three days longer.</P>
<P N="10">10. They were now nineteen per&s;ons in all; in this num|ber were a friar and a carpenter, both of whom they would exempt, as the one was u&s;eful to ab&s;olve and comfort them in their la&s;t extremity, and the other to repair the pinnace in ca&s;e of a leak or other accident.</P>
<P N="11">11. The &s;ame compliment they paid to their new cap|tain, he being the odd man, and his life of much con&s;e|quence. He refu&s;ed their indulgence a great while; but at la&s;t they obliged him to acquie&s;ce; &s;o that there were four to die out of the &s;ixteen remaining per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="12">12. The three fir&s;t &s;ubmitted to their fate. The fourth was a Portugue&s;e gentleman who had a younger brother in the boat, who, &s;eeing him about to be thrown overboard, mo&s;t tenderly embraced him, and with tears in his eyes be|&s;ought him to let him die in his room; enforcing his argu|ments by telling him that he was a married man, and had a wife and children at Goa, be&s;ides the care of three &s;i&s;ters, who ab&s;olutely depended upon him; that, as for him&s;elf, he was &s;ingle, and his life of no great importance; he there|fore conjured him to &s;uffer him to &s;upply his place.</P>
<P N="13">13. The elder brother, a&s;toni&s;hed, and melting with this genero&s;ity, replied, that, &s;ince the divine providence had appointed him to &s;uffer, it would be wicked and unju&s;t to permit any other to die for him, e&s;pecially a brother, to whom he was &s;o infinitely obliged. The younger, per&s;i&s;ting in his purpo&s;e, would take no denial; but throwing him&s;elf on his knees, held his brother &s;o fa&s;t, that the company could not di&s;engage them.</P>
<P N="14">14. Thus they di&s;puted for a while, the elder brother bidding him to be a father to his children, and recommend|ed his wife to his protection; and as he would inherit his e&s;tate, to take care of their common &s;i&s;ters; but all he could &s;ay could not make the younger de&s;i&s;t. This was a &s;cene of tenderne&s;s that mu&s;t fill every brea&s;t, &s;u&s;ceptible of gen|erous impre&s;&s;ions, with pity. At la&s;t the con&s;tancy of the elder brother yielded to the piety of the other.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="156" REF="026674_0156_0FD1567174689C58">15. He acquie&s;ced, and &s;uffered the gallant youth to &s;upply his place, who being ca&s;t into the &s;ea, and a good &s;wimmer, &s;oon got to the &s;tern of the pinnace, and laid hold of the rudder with his right hand, which being per|ceived by one of the &s;ailors, he cut off the hand with his &s;word; then dropping into the &s;ea, he pre&s;ently caught hold again with his left, which received the &s;ame fate by a &s;ec|ond blow.</P>
<P N="16">16. Thus di&s;membered of both hands, he made a &s;hift, notwith&s;tanding, to keep him&s;elf above water with his feet and two &s;tumps, which he held bleeding upwards.</P>
<P N="17">17. This moving &s;pectacle &s;o rai&s;ed the pity of the whole company, that they cried out, "He is but one man, let us endeavor to &s;ave his life;" and he was accordingly taken into the boat, where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad his hands bound up as well as the place and circum&s;tances could permit.</P>
<P N="18">18. They rowed all that night; and the next morning, when the &s;un aro&s;e, as if Heaven would reward the piety of this young man, they de&s;cried land, which proved to be the mountains of Mozambique, in Africa, not far from a Por|tugue&s;e colony. Thither they all &s;afely arrived, where they remained until the next &s;hip from Li&s;bon pa&s;&s;ed by and carried them to Goa.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE GRAMMATICALLY.</HEAD>
<P>A RIGHT education of children has ever been e&s;teemed by the be&s;t philo&s;ophers and wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;la|tors, as the mo&s;t certain &s;ource of happine&s;s, not only to families, but to &s;tates and kingdoms; and is, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll moral and civil con&s;iderations, the fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ing in order and ne|ce&s;&s;ity, the highe&s;t in value and importance, and, in the&s;e united republics, the grand ba&s;is on which their future hap|pine&s;s and pro&s;perity depend.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of &s;uch ine&s;timable worth was right education held by the ancients, that when they were in all their glory, and long after, the tutorage of youth was accounted the mo&s;t honorable employment; and many of noble birth and ea&s;y
<PB N="157" REF="026674_0157_0FD156742F831600">
fortunes became preceptors, and took youth under their tuition.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is well known that the Romans, as well as Greeks, carefully applied them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of their own lan|guage, and were early able to &s;peak and write it in the greate&s;t perfection. Ma&s;ters taught them, betimes, the principles, the difficulties, the &s;ubtilties and the depths of it. And to that it was chiefly owing, that they made more early advances in the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;ciences, than any youth have &s;ince done.</P>
<P N="4">4. The French have been beforehand with us in this important particular. They have long imitated the Greeks and Romans, and have had the good policy to prefer their own language to every other; di&s;daining the &s;tudy of any for|eign tongues, unle&s;s driven by nece&s;&s;ity into other countries. And the political advantages they have derived from &s;uch a conduct are vi&s;ible all over Europe.</P>
<P N="5">5. Policy then, were there nothing el&s;e, cries aloud for our exerting our&s;elves in the cau&s;e of a too long neglected Engli&s;h education; and for wiping off that charge of bar|barity, with which not only we, but tho&s;e of England, have been, on that account, &s;o long &s;tigmatized by the very na|tion whom we &s;o much venerate, and who&s;e language we are &s;o ridiculou&s;ly fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of, to the reproach and degradation of a better, even our own.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is, perhaps, no language the grammatical knowledge of which can be learned with &s;o much ea&s;e, or with le&s;s difficulty than ours. And as the freedom, the liberty, and the life of our country depend upon it, &s;hall America deprive her &s;ons of this mo&s;t valuable birthright, the right of nature?</P>
<P N="7">7. It is to me the mo&s;t unaccountable thing I ever heard, that ma&s;ters, and tho&s;e who &s;uperintend public &s;chools, &s;hould neglect this important part of an education, and &s;uffer youth to trifle away their time, when it might be em|ployed to &s;o much advantage to them&s;elves and to future generations. And what is &s;till more &s;o, is, that parents, who love their children, &s;hould connive at this unpardona|ble neglect.</P>
<P N="8">8. Without a common &s;chool education, which is the anchor of liberty, the &s;upporter of our rights, we can be
<PB N="158" REF="026674_0158_0FD1567622F445D0">
compared to nothing but a &s;hip at &s;ea, deprived of &s;ails, rudder, compa&s;s, and expo&s;ed to the billows and hurricanes of the boi&s;terous deep.</P>
<P N="9">9. With it, we have a mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial foundation laid, on which we can erect a &s;uperb building, for public and private utility: with it, we can conduct the &s;hip of &s;tate, and regale our&s;elves under the tree of liberty; and un&s;hackle our&s;elves from ignorance, which is the origin of feuds and animo&s;ities in free &s;tates.</P>
<P N="10">10. Do not the arts and &s;ciences, in every kingdom, participate to a great degree the &s;ate of its language? ri&s;e and flouri&s;h, or &s;ink into di&s;repute, as the latter is cultivated or neglected? How dear then ought the honor of the Engli&s;h language to be to every American!</P>
<P N="11">11. And, as grammar is the &s;olid foundation on which all other &s;cience re&s;ts, and as all human inquiry is divided into &s;cience and language; and further, as under the lat|ter, fall the ideas and &s;ubjects of the didactic &s;tyle, oratory, poetry, painting, and &s;culpture, judge ye, if it ought to be left to young gentlemen to form their &s;tyle by chance, or to begin the &s;tudy of their mother tongue, at a time of life which calls them forth to action.</P>
<P N="12">12. You, who are entru&s;ted with the education of our youth, and you, who &s;uperintend our &s;chools, have a glori|ous and joyful pro&s;pect before you, a noble opportunity in|deed of doing much good to mankind; of con&s;tituting real merit, and &s;ecuring the warme&s;t returns of gratitude, by perfecting the flower of our youth, in &s;peaking and writing that language, in which alone they mu&s;t act the part of their fathers, &s;erve their country, and become the mouths of the people.</P>
<P N="13">13. You will not fail, my beloved countrymen, to afford your children this di&s;tingui&s;hing, this nece&s;&s;ary, this all im|portant education, by which you will, in a &s;hort time, nur&s;e up a race of freemen, to the honor and never fading glory of our country.</P>
<P N="14">14. America will then increa&s;e in wealth, in commerce, agriculture and manufactures; will as far &s;urpa&s;s all other nations on the globe, in virtue, learning and abilities; and will as much di&s;tingui&s;h her&s;elf for humanity, noblene&s;s of &s;entiment, attachment to government, and love of liberty,

<HEAD>THE HOTTENTOT AND THE LION.</HEAD>
<P>AN elderly Hottentot in the &s;ervice of a Chri&s;tian, near the upper part of Sunday river on the Camb|debo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de, perceived a lion following him at a great di&s;|tance for two hours together. Thence he naturally con|cluded, that the lion only waited for the approach of dark|ne&s;s, in order to make him a prey; and in the mean time, could not expect any other than to &s;erve for this fierce an|imal's &s;upper, ina&s;much as he had no other weapon of de|fence than a &s;tick, and knew that he could not get home before it was dark.</P>
<P N="2">2. But as he was well acquainted with the nature of the lion, and the manner of its &s;eizing upon its prey; and at the &s;ame time had lei&s;ure to ruminate on the ways and means in which it was mo&s;t likely that his exi&s;tence would be terminated, he at length hit on a method of &s;aving his life.</P>
<P N="3">3. For this purpo&s;e, in&s;tead of making the be&s;t of his way home, he looked out for a precipice; and &s;etting him|&s;elf down on the edge of it, found to his great joy, that the lion likewi&s;e made a halt, and kept at the &s;ame di&s;tance as before.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<HEAD>NARRATIVE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF FOUR SAILORS, WHO WERE CAST AWAY ON THE DESERT ISLAND OF SPITSBERGEN.</HEAD>
<P>THESE northern &s;eas, owing to the exce&s;|&s;ive cold of the climate, are frequently &s;o full of ice as to render it exceedingly hazardous to &s;hips, which are thereby expo&s;ed to the danger of being cru&s;hed between two bodies of immen&s;e ice, or of being &s;o completely &s;urrounded, as to deprive them of every power of moving from the &s;pot.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this latter alarming &s;ituation were the crew of a Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hip. A council was immediately held, when the mate mentioned what he recollected to have heard, that a &s;hip's crew from Me&s;en, &s;ome time before, had formed a re&s;olution of pa&s;&s;ing the winter upon this i&s;land, and for that purpo&s;e had carried timber proper for building a hut at a little di&s;tance from the &s;hore.</P>
<P N="3">3. This information led the whole company to form the re&s;olution of wintering there, &s;hould the hut be fortu|nately remaining. They were induced to adopt this mea&s;|ure from the certainty of peri&s;hing &s;hould they remain in the &s;hip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> They therefore deputized four of their crew to go in &s;earch of the hut, and make what further di&s;coveries they could.</P>
<P N="4">4. As no human creature inhabited the &s;hore on which they were to land, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for them to carry &s;ome provi&s;ions with them for their &s;upport. They had to make their way, for nearly two miles, over loo&s;e heaps of ice, which the water had rai&s;ed, and the wind had driven again&s;t each other; and this made it equally difficult and dangerous.</P>
<P N="5">5. From this con&s;ideration, they avoided loading them|&s;elves too much with provi&s;ions, le&s;t their weight might &s;ink them between the pieces of ice, where they mu&s;t in|evitably peri&s;h.</P>
<P N="6">6. Having previou&s;ly con&s;idered all the&s;e matters, they provided them&s;elves only with a mu&s;ket and powder-horn, containing twelve charges of powder and ball, an axe, a &s;mall kettle, a bag with about twenty pounds of flour, a
<PB N="164" REF="026674_0164_0FD156834F2ED740">
knife, a tinder-box and tinder, a bladder filled with tobac|co, and every man his wooden pipe.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thus poorly equipped, the&s;e four &s;ailors reached the i&s;land, little thinking what they were to endure while they remained on it. After exploring &s;ome &s;mall part of the country, they di&s;covered the hut they were in pur&s;uit of, at the di&s;tance of about an Engli&s;h mile and a half from the &s;hore.</P>
<P N="8">8. Its length was thirty-&s;ix feet, and its height and breadth eighteen. It con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;mall antichamber about twelve feet broad, having two doors, the one to exclude the outer air, and the other to form a communication with the inner room. This contributed not a little to keep the larger room warm, when it was once heated.</P>
<P N="9">9. They found in the larger room an earthen &s;tove, con&s;tructed in the Ruffian manner. They rejoiced exceed|ingly at this di&s;covery, though they found the hut had &s;uf|fered very much from the &s;everity of the weather, it having been built a con&s;iderable time. However, they contrived to make it &s;upportable for that night.</P>
<P N="10">10. The next morning early they repaired to the &s;hore; in order to acquaint their comrades with their &s;ucce&s;s, and al&s;o to get from the ve&s;&s;el &s;uch provi&s;ions, ammunition, and other nece&s;&s;aries, as might in &s;ome mea&s;ure enable them to &s;truggle with the approaching winter.</P>
<P N="11">11. But what pen can properly de&s;cribe the terrible &s;it|uation of their minds, when, coming to the place at which they landed, they di&s;covered nothing but an open &s;ea, clear of all ice, though, but a day before, it had covered the ocean! During the night, a violent &s;torm had ari&s;en, which had been the cau&s;e of this change of appearance in the ocean.</P>
<P N="12">12. Whether the ice, which had before &s;urrounded the ve&s;&s;el, being put in motion by the violence of the winds and waves, had cru&s;hed the &s;hip to pieces, or whether &s;he had been carried by the current into the main ocean, it was im|po&s;&s;ible for them to determine.</P>
<P N="13">13. However, they &s;aw the &s;hip no more; and as &s;he was never afterwards heard of, it is mo&s;t likely that &s;he went to the bottom with every &s;oul on board. This dread|ful
<PB N="165" REF="026674_0165_0FD1568398EFF8E0">
event deprived the poor unhappy wretches of all hopes of ever again &s;eeing their native country.</P>
<P N="14">14. They returned to their hut, and there bewailed their deplorable lot, more perhaps to be pitied than tho&s;e who were buried in the bo&s;om of the deep. Their thoughts were, in cour&s;e, fir&s;t directed to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and to repair their hut.</P>
<P N="15">15. Their twelve charges of powder and &s;hot &s;oon pro|duced them as many rein-deer, of which there fortunately happened to be many on the i&s;land. They then &s;et about repairing their hut, and filled up all the crevices, through which the air found its way, with the mo&s;s that grew there in plenty.</P>
<P N="16">16. As it was impo&s;&s;ible to live in that climate without fire, and as no wood grew upon the i&s;land, they were much alarmed on that account. However, in their wan|derings over the beach, they met with plenty of wood, which had been driven on &s;hore by the waves.</P>
<P N="17">17. This principally con&s;i&s;ted of the wrecks of &s;hips; but &s;ometimes whole trees with their roots came on &s;hore, the undoubted produce of &s;ome more ho&s;pitable clime, which were wa&s;hed from their native &s;oil by the overflow|ings of rivers, or &s;ome other accident.</P>
<P N="18">18. As &s;oon as their powder and &s;hot were exhau&s;ted, they began to be in dread of peri&s;hing with hunger; but good fortune, and their own ingenuity, to which nece&s;&s;ity always gives a &s;pur, removed the&s;e dreadful apprehen&s;ions. In the cour&s;e of their traver&s;ing the beach, they one day di&s;covered &s;ome boards, in which were large hooks and nails in abundance.</P>
<P N="19">19. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e, they made &s;pears and arrows&punc; and, from a yew tree, which had been thrown on &s;hore by the waves, they formed plenty of bows. With the&s;e weapons, during the time of their continuance on the i&s;land, they killed upwards of two hundred and fifty rein|deer, bende a great number of blue and white foxes.</P>
<P N="20">20. The fle&s;h of the&s;e animals &s;erved them for food, and their &s;kins were equally u&s;eful in &s;upplying them with warm cloathing. The number of white bears they killed were only ten; for the&s;e animals being very &s;trong, defend|ed them&s;elves with great vigor and fury, and even ventured
<PB N="166" REF="026674_0166_0FD156846139F758">
to make their appearance frequently at the door of their hut, from whence they were driven with &s;ome difficulty and danger.</P>
<P N="21">21. Thus the&s;e three different &s;orts of animals were the only food of the&s;e mi&s;erable mariners, during their long and dreary abode on this i&s;land.</P>
<P N="22">22. The inten&s;ene&s;s of the cold, and the want of prop|er conveniences, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them to cook their victuals properly, &s;o that they were obliged to eat their provi&s;ions almo&s;t raw, and without bread or &s;alt.</P>
<P N="23">23. There was but one &s;tove in the hut, and that being in the Ru&s;&s;ian manner, was not proper for boiling. How|ever, to remedy this inconvenience as much as po&s;&s;ible, they dried &s;ome of their provi&s;ions, during the &s;ummer, in the open air, and then hung them up in the upper part of the hut, which being continually filled with &s;moke, they thus became thoroughly dried.</P>
<P N="24">24. This they u&s;ed in&s;tead of bread, which made them reli&s;h their half boiled meat the better. They pro|cured their water in &s;ummer from the rivulets that fell from the rocks; and in the winter, from &s;now and ice thawed. This was their only drink; and their &s;mall ket|tle was the only convenience they had to make u&s;e of for this and many other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="25">25. As it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep up a continual fire, they were particularly cautious not to let the light be ex|tingui&s;hed; for, though they had both &s;teel and flints, yet they had no tinder; and it would have been a terrible thing to be without light in a climate where darkne&s;s reigns &s;o many months during winter.</P>
<P N="26">26. They therefore fa&s;hioned a kind of lamp, which they filled with rein-deer fat, and &s;tuck into it &s;ome twi&s;ted linen, &s;haped in the form of a wick. After many trials, they at la&s;t brought their lamp to complete perfection, and kept it burning, without intermi&s;&s;ion, from the day they fir&s;t made it, till they embarked for their native country.</P>
<P N="27">27. They al&s;o found them&s;elves in want of &s;hoes, boots, and other nece&s;&s;ary articles of dre&s;s, for all which they found wonderful re&s;ources in that genius to which nece&s;&s;ity gives birth.</P>
<P N="28"><PB N="167" REF="026674_0167_0FD15687D3CB98B0">28. Having lived more than &s;ix years upon this dreary and inho&s;pitable i&s;land, a &s;hip happened to arrive there, which took three of them on board, and carried them back to their native country. The fourth man was &s;eized with the &s;curvy, and being naturally indolent, and not u&s;ing proper exerci&s;e, he died, after lingering for &s;ome time, when his companions buried him in the &s;now.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF CANULEIUS, A ROMAN TRI|BUNE, TO THE CONSULS, IN BEHALF OF THE PLEBEIANS.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT an in&s;ult upon us is this! If we are not &s;o rich as the patricians, are we not citizens of Rome as well as they? inhabitants of the &s;ame country? members of the &s;ame community? The nations bordering upon Rome, and even &s;trangers more remote, are admitted not only to marriages with us, but to what is of much greater importance, the freedom of the city.</P>
<P N="2">2. Are we, becau&s;e we are commoners, to be wor&s;e treated than &s;trangers? And, when we demand that the people may be free to be&s;tow their offices and dignities on whom they plea&s;e, do we a&s;k any thing unrea&s;onable or new? Do we claim more than their original inherent right? What occa&s;ion, then, for all this uproar, as if the univer&s;e was falling to ruin? They were ju&s;t going to lay violent hands upon me in the &s;enate-hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. What! mu&s;t this empire, then, be unavoidably over|turned? Mu&s;t Rome of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ink at once, if a plebeian, worthy of the office, &s;hould be rai&s;ed to the con&s;ul&s;hip? The patricians, I am per&s;uaded, if they could, would de|prive you of the common light. It certainly offends them that you breathe, that you &s;peak, that you have the &s;hapes of men.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nay, but to make a commoner a con&s;ul, would be, &s;ay they, a mo&s;t enormous thing. Numa Pompilius, how|ever, without being &s;o much as a Roman citizen, was made king of Rome. The elder Tarquin, by birth not even Ital|ian, was neverthele&s;s placed upon the throne. Servius Tul|lius,
<PB N="168" REF="026674_0168_0FD15689B6E26658">
the &s;on of a captive woman, (nobody knows who his father was) has obtained the kingdom as the reward of his wi&s;dom and virtue.</P>
<P N="5">5. In tho&s;e days, no man in whom virtue &s;hone con|&s;picuous was rejected or de&s;pi&s;ed on account of his race and de&s;cent. And did the &s;tate pro&s;per the le&s;s for that? Were not the&s;e &s;trangers the very be&s;t of all our kings? And &s;up|po&s;ing now, that a plebeian &s;hould have their talents and merit, mu&s;t not he be &s;uffered to govern us?</P>
<P N="6">6. But, "we find that, upon the abolition of the regal power, no commoner was cho&s;en to the con&s;ulate." And what of that? Before Numa's time, there were no pontiffs in Rome. Before Servius Tullius' days, there was no cen|&s;us, no divi&s;ion of the people into cla&s;&s;es and centuries. Who ever heard of con&s;uls before the expul&s;ion of Tarquin the proud? Dictators, we all know, are of modern inven|tion; and &s;o are the offices of tribunes, aedilles, quae&s;tors.</P>
<P N="7">7. Within the&s;e ten years we have made decemvirs, and we have unmade them. Is nothing to be done but what has been done before? That very law forbidding marriages of patricians with plebeians, is not that a new thing? Was there any &s;uch law before the decemvirs enacted it? and a mo&s;t &s;hameful one it is in a free &s;tate. Such marriages, it &s;eems, would taint the pure blood of the nobility.</P>
<P N="8">8. They talk to us of the confu&s;ion there will be in families&punc; if this &s;tatute &s;hould be repealed. I wonder they do not mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> law again&s;t a commoner's living near a no|bleman, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the &s;ame road that he is going, or being pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ame fea&s;t, or appearing in the &s;ame market-place. They might as well pretend that the&s;e things make confu&s;ion in families, as that intermarriages will do it.</P>
<P N="9">9. Does not every one know, that the children will be ranked according to the quality of their father, let him be a patrician or a plebeian? In &s;hort, it is manife&s;t enough that we have nothing in view but to be treated as men and citi|zens; nor can they who oppo&s;e our demand have any mo|tive to do it but the love of domineering.</P>
<P N="10">10. Hear me, con&s;uls. Whether the news of the war you talk of be true, or whether it be only a fal&s;e r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mor &s;pread <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">broad for nothing but a color to &s;end the people out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity.

<P N="11">11.

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF THE FALLS OF NIAGARA.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many natural curio&s;ities which this country affords, the cataract of Niagara is infinitely the greate&s;t. In order to have a tolerable idea of this &s;tu|pendous fall of water, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to conceive that part of the country in which Lake Erie is &s;ituated, to be el|evated above that which contains Lake Ontario, about three hundred feet.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;lope which &s;eparates the upper and lower coun|try, is generally very &s;teep, and in many places almo&s;t per|pendicular. It is formed by horizontal &s;trata of &s;tone, great part of which is what we commonly call lime-&s;tone. The &s;lope may be traced from the north &s;ide of Lake Onta|rio, near the bay of Taronto, round the we&s;t end of the lake; thence its direction is generally ea&s;t, between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie; it cro&s;&s;es the &s;trait of Niagara, and the Chene&s;eco river, after which it becomes lo&s;t in the country towards the Seneca Lake.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="170" REF="026674_0170_0FD1568E69E5B158">3. It is to this &s;lope that our country is indebted, both for the cataract of Niagara, and the great falls of the Chen|e&s;eco. The cataract of Niagara was formerly down at the northern &s;ide of the &s;lope, near to that place which is now known by the name of the Landing; but from the great length of time, added to the great quantity of water, and di&s;tance which it falls, the &s;olid &s;tone is worn away, for about &s;even miles, up towards Lake Erie, and a cha&s;m is formed which no per&s;on can approach without horror.</P>
<P N="4">4. Down this cha&s;m the water ru&s;hes with a mo&s;t a&s;ton|i&s;hing velocity, after it makes the great pitch. In going up the road near this cha&s;m, the fancy is con&s;tantly engaged in the contemplation of the mo&s;t romantic and awful pro&s;|pects imaginable, until, at length, the eye catches the falls; the imagination is in&s;tantly arre&s;ted, and you admire in &s;i|lence! The river is about one hundred and thirty-five poles wide, at the falls, and the perpendicular pitch one hundred and fifty feet.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fall of this va&s;t body of water produces a &s;ound, which is frequently heard at the di&s;tance of twenty miles, and a &s;en&s;ible tremulous motion in the earth for &s;ome poles round. A heavy fog, or cloud, is con&s;tantly a&s;cending from the falls, in which rainbows may always be &s;een, when the &s;un &s;hines.</P>
<P N="6">6. This fog, or &s;pray, in the winter &s;ea&s;on, falls upon the neighboring trees, where it congeals, and produces a mo&s;t beautiful chry&s;talline appearance. This remark is equally applicable to the falls of the Chene&s;eco.</P>
<P N="7">7. The difficulty which would attend levelling the rap|ids in the cha&s;m, prevented my attempting it; but I con|jecture the water mu&s;t de&s;cend at lea&s;t &s;ixty-five feet. The perpendicular pitch at the cataract is one hundred and fif|ty feet; to the&s;e add fifty-eight feet, which the water falls in the la&s;t half mile, immediately above the falls, and we have two hundred and &s;eventy-three feet, which the water falls, in a di&s;tance of about &s;even miles and a half.</P>
<P N="8">8. If either ducks, or gee&s;e, inadvertently, alight in the rapids, above the great cataract, they are incapable of get|ting on the wing again, and are in&s;tantly hurried on to de|&s;truction. There is one appearance at this cataract, wor|thy of &s;ome attention, and which I do not remember to have &s;een noted by any writer.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="171" REF="026674_0171_0FD156944D20E2B8">9. Ju&s;t below the great pitch, the water and foam may be &s;een puffed up in &s;pherical figures, nearly as large as common cocks of hay; they bur&s;t at the top, and project a column of &s;pray to a prodigious height; they then &s;ub|&s;ide, and are &s;ucceeded by others, which bur&s;t in like man|ner. This appearance is mo&s;t con&s;picuous about half way between the i&s;land, that divides the falls, and the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;trait, where the large&s;t column of water de&s;cends.</P>

We are bound to it by duty; we are invited to it by intere&s;t; and becau&s;e both the&s;e cords are often feeble, we have nat|ural kind affections to aid them in their operations, and &s;up|ply their defects; and the&s;e affections are joined with a manly plea&s;ure in their exertion.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are amiable even in brute animals. We love the meekne&s;s of the lamb, the gentlene&s;s of the dove, the affection of a dog to his ma&s;ter. We cannot, without plea&s;ure, ob&s;erve the timid ewe, who never &s;howed the lea&s;t degree of courage in her own defence, become valiant and intrepid in defence of her lamb, and boldly a&s;&s;ault tho&s;e ene|mies, the very &s;ight of whom was wont to put her to flight.</P>
<P N="3">3. How plea&s;ant is it to &s;ee the family economy of a pair of little birds, in rearing their tender offspring; the conjugal affection and fidelity of the parents; their cheerful toil and indu&s;try in providing food to their family; their &s;agacity in concealing their habitation; the arts they u&s;e, often at the peril of their own lives, to decoy hawks and other enemies from their dwelling-place; and the afflic|tion they feel, when &s;ome unlucky boy has robbed them of the dear pledges of their affection, and fru&s;trated all their hopes of their ri&s;ing family?</P>
<P N="4">4. If kind affection be amiable in brutes, it is not le&s;s &s;o in our own &s;pecies. Even the external &s;igns of it have
<PB N="172" REF="026674_0172_0FD1569620BB8828">
a powerful charm. Every one knows that a per&s;on of accompli&s;hed good breeding, charms every one he con|ver&s;es with. And what is this good breeding? If we ana|lize it, we &s;hall find it to be made up of looks, ge&s;tures and &s;peeches, which are the natural &s;igns of benevolence and good affection.</P>
<P N="5">5. He who has the habit of u&s;ing the&s;e &s;igns with pro|priety, and without meanne&s;s, is well bred and polite. What is that in the features of the face, which all men ad|mire? I believe it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the features which indicate good affections.</P>
<P N="6">6. Every indication of meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and benig|nity, is a beauty. On the contrary, every feature that in|dicates pride, pa&s;&s;ion, envy, and malignity, is a deformity. Kind affections, therefore, are amiable in brutes. Even the &s;igns and &s;hadows of them are highly attract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e in our own &s;pecies.</P>
<P N="7">7. Indeed they are the joy and the comfort of human life, not to good men only, but even to the vicious and di&s;|&s;olute. Without &s;ociety, and the intercour&s;e of affection, man is a gloomy, melancholy, and joyle&s;s being.</P>
<P N="8">8. His mind oppre&s;&s;ed with cares and fears, he cannot enjoy the balm of &s;ound &s;leep. In con&s;tant dread of im|pending danger, he &s;tarts at the ru&s;tling of a leaf. His ears are continually upon the &s;tretch, and every zephyr brings &s;ome &s;ound that alarms him.</P>
<P N="9">9. When he enters into &s;ociety, and feels &s;ecurity in the good affection of friends and neighbors, it is then only that his fear vani&s;hes, and his mind is at ea&s;e. His courage is rai&s;ed, his under&s;tanding is enlightened, and his heart di|lates with joy.</P>
<P N="10">10. Human &s;ociety may be compared to a heap of em|bers, which, when placed a&s;under, can retain neither their light nor heat, amid&s;t the &s;urrounding elements; but when brought together, they mutually give heat and light to each other; the flame breaks forth, and not only defends it&s;elf, but &s;ubdues every thing around it.</P>
<P N="11">11. The &s;ecurity, the happine&s;s, and the &s;trength of hu|man &s;ociety, &s;pring &s;olely from the reciprocal benevolent af|fections of its members. The benevolent affections, though they be all honorable and lovely, are not all equally &s;o.
<PB N="173" REF="026674_0173_0FD156986D8A5340">
There is a &s;ubordination among them; and the honor we pay to them generally corre&s;ponds to the extent of their object.</P>
<P N="12">12. The good hu&s;band, the good father, the good friend, the good neighbor, we honor as a good man, wor|thy of our love and affection. But the man in whom the&s;e more private affections are &s;wallowed up in zeal for the good of his country, and of mankind, who goes about doing good, and &s;eeks opportunities of being u&s;eful to his &s;pecies, we revere as more than a good man; we e&s;teem him as a hero.</P>

<HEAD>NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTIVITY OF MRS. JEMIMA HOWE, TAKEN BY THE INDIANS AT HINS|DALE, NEW-HAMPSHIRE,
<DATE>JULY 27, 1755.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>AS Me&s;&s;rs. Caleb Howe, Hilkiah Grou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and Benjamin Gaffield, who had been hoeing corn in the meadow, we&s;t of the river, were returning home a little be|fore &s;un&s;et, to a place called Bridgman's Fort, they were fired upon by twelve Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who had ambu&s;hed their path.</P>
<P N="2">2. Howe was on hor&s;eback, with two young lads, his children, behind him. A ball, which broke his thigh, brought him to the ground. His hor&s;e ran a few rods and fell likewi&s;e, and both the lads were taken. The Indians in their &s;avage manner, coming up to Howe, pierced his body with a &s;pear, tore off his &s;calp, &s;tuck a hatchet in his head, and left him in this forlorn condition.</P>
<P N="3">3. He was found alive the morning after, by a party of men from Fort Hin&s;dale; and being a&s;ked by one of the party whether he knew him, he an&s;wered, Yes, I know you all. The&s;e were his la&s;t words, though he did not ex|pire until after his friends had arrived with him at Fort Hin&s;dale. Grout was &s;o fortunate as to e&s;cape unhurt.</P>
<P N="4">4. But Gaffield, in attempting to wade through the riv|er, at a certain place which was indeed fordable at that time, was unfortunately drowned. Flu&s;hed with the &s;ucce&s;s they had met with here, the &s;avages went directly to Bridgman's Fort. There was no man in it, and only three women and &s;ome children, Mrs. Jemima Howe, Mrs. Submit Grout, and Mrs. Eunice Gaffield.</P>
<P N="5">5. Their hu&s;bands I need not mention again, and their feelings at this juncture I will not attempt to de&s;cribe. They had heard the enemies' guns, but knew not what had happened to their friends.</P>
<P N="6">6. Extremely anxious for their &s;afety, they &s;tood long|ing to embrace them, until at length, concluding from the noi&s;e they heard without that &s;ome of them were come, they unbarred the gate in a hurry to receive them; when lo! to their inexpre&s;&s;ible di&s;appointment and &s;urpri&s;e, in|&s;tead of their hu&s;bands, in ru&s;hed a number of hideous In|dians,
<PB N="177" REF="026674_0177_0FD156A0F199E810">
to whom they and their tender offspring became an ea&s;y prey; and from whom they had nothing to expect, but either an immediate death, or a long and doleful captivity.</P>
<P N="7">7. The latter of the&s;e, by the favor of Providence, turned out to be the lot of the&s;e unhappy women, and their &s;till more unhappy, becau&s;e more helple&s;s children. Mrs. Gaffield had but one, Mrs. Grout had three, and Mrs. Howe &s;even. The elde&s;t of Mrs. Howe's was eleven years old, and the younge&s;t but &s;ix months.</P>
<P N="8">8. The two elde&s;t were daughters, which &s;he had by her fir&s;t hu&s;band, Mr. William Phipps, who was al&s;o &s;lain by the Indians, of which I doubt not but you have &s;een an account in Mr. Doolittle's hi&s;tory. It was from the mouth of this woman that I lately received the foregoing account. She al&s;o gave me, I doubt not, a true, though, to be &s;ure, a very brief and imperfect hi&s;tory of her captivity, which I here in&s;ert for your peru&s;al.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Indians (&s;he &s;ays) having plundered and put fire to the fort, we marched, as near as I could judge, a mile and a half into the woods, where we encamped that night.</P>
<P N="10">10. When the morning came, and we had advanced as much farther, &s;ix Indians were &s;ent back to the place of our late abode, who collected a little more plunder, and de&s;troyed &s;ome other effects that had been left behind; but they did not return until the day was &s;o far &s;pent, that it was judged be&s;t to continue where we were through the night.</P>
<P N="11">11. Early the next morning we &s;et off for Canada, and continued our march eight days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, until we had reached the place where the Indians had left their canoes, about fifteen miles from Crown Point. This was a long and tedious march; but the captives, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, were enabled to endure it with le&s;s trouble and difficulty than they had rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P N="12">12. From &s;uch &s;avage ma&s;ters, in &s;uch indigent circum|&s;tances, we could not rationally hope for kinder treatment than we received. Some of us, it is true, had a harder lot than others; and, among the children, I thought my &s;on Squire had the harde&s;t of any.</P>
<P N="13">13. He was then only four years old, and when we &s;topped to re&s;t our weary limbs, and he &s;at down on his
<PB N="178" REF="026674_0178_0FD156A25A42AFD0">
ma&s;ter's pack, the &s;avage mon&s;ter would often knock him off; and &s;ometimes too with the handle of his hatchet. Several ugly marks, indented in his head by the cruel In|dians, at that tender age, are &s;till plainly to be &s;een.</P>
<P N="14">14. At length we arrived at Crown Point, and took up our quarters there, for the &s;pace of near a week. In the mean time, &s;ome of the Indians went to Montreal, and took &s;everal of the weary captives along with them, with a view of &s;elling them to the French. They did not &s;uc|ceed, however, in finding a market for any of them.</P>
<P N="15">15. They gave my younge&s;t daughter to the governor, de Vaudreuil, had a drunken frolic, and returned again to Crown Point, with the re&s;t of their pri&s;oners. From hence we &s;et off for St. John's, in four or five canoes, ju&s;t as night was coming on, and were &s;oon &s;urrounded with darkne&s;s.</P>
<P N="16">16. A heavy &s;torm hung over us. The &s;ound of the rolling thunder was very terrible upon the waters, which at every fla&s;h of expan&s;ive lightning &s;eemed to be all in a blaze. Yet to this we were indebted for all the light we enjoyed. No object could we di&s;cern any longer than the fla&s;hes la&s;ted.</P>
<P N="17">17. In this po&s;ture we &s;ailed in our open tottering ca|noes, almo&s;t the whole of that dreary night. The morn|ing indeed had not yet begun to dawn, when we all went a&s;hore; and having collected a heap of &s;and and gravel for a pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">low. I laid my&s;elf down, with my tender infant by my &s;ide, not knowing where any of my other children were, or what a mi&s;erable condition they might be in.</P>
<P N="18">18. The next day, however, under the wing of that ever-pre&s;ent and all-powerful Providence, which had pre|&s;erved us through the darkne&s;s and imminent dangers of the preceding night, we all arrived in &s;afety at St. John's.</P>
<P N="19">19. Our next movement was to St. Francois, the me|tropolis, if I may &s;o call it, to which the Indians, who led us captive, belonged. Soon after our arrival at that wretched capital, a council, con&s;i&s;ting of the chief Sachem, and &s;ome principal warriors of the St. Francois tribe, was convened; and after the ceremonies u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions were over, I was conducted and delivered to an old &s;quaw, whom the Indians told me I mu&s;t call my mother.</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="179" REF="026674_0179_0FD156A65B950518">20. My infant &s;till continued to be the property of its original Indian owners. I was neverthele&s;s permitted to keep it with me a while longer, for the &s;ake of &s;aving them the trouble of looking after it. When the weather began to grow cold, &s;huddering at the pro&s;pect of approaching winter, I acquainted my new mother, that I did not think it would be po&s;&s;ible for me to endure it, if I mu&s;t &s;pend it with her, and fare as the Indians did.</P>
<P N="21">21. Li&s;tening to my repeated and earne&s;t &s;olicitations, that I might be di&s;po&s;ed of among &s;ome of the French in|habitants of Canada, &s;he, at length, &s;et off with me and my infant, attended by &s;ome male Indians, upon a journey to Montreal, in hopes of finding a market for me there. But the attempt proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the journey tedious indeed.</P>
<P N="22">22. Our provi&s;ions were &s;o &s;canty as well as in&s;ipid and un&s;avory; the weather was &s;o cold, and the travelling &s;o very bad, that it often &s;eemed as if I mu&s;t have peri&s;hed on the way.</P>
<P N="23">23. While we were at Montreal, we went into the hou&s;e of a certain French gentleman, who&s;e lady, being &s;ent for, and coming into the room where I was, to examine me, &s;eeing I had an infant, exclaimed with an oath, "I will not buy a woman who has a child to look after."</P>
<P N="24">24. There was a &s;will-pail &s;tanding near me, in which I ob&s;erved &s;ome cru&s;ts and crumbs of bread &s;wimming on the &s;urface of the grea&s;y liquor it contained. Sorely pinch|ed w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th hunger, I &s;kimmed them off with my hands, and ate them; and this was all the refre&s;hment which the hou&s;e afforded me.</P>
<P N="25">25. Somewhere in the cour&s;e of this vi&s;it to Montreal, my Indian mother was &s;o unfortunate as to catch the &s;mall-pox, of which di&s;temper &s;he died, &s;oon after our return, which was by water, to St. Francois. And now came on the &s;ea&s;on when the Indians began to prepare for a win|ter's hunt.</P>
<P N="26">26. I was ordered to return my poor child to tho&s;e of them who &s;till claimed it as their property. This was a &s;evere trial. The babe clung to my bo&s;om with all its might; but I was obliged to pluck it thence, and deliver it, &s;hrieking and &s;creaming, enough to penetrate a heart of
<PB N="180" REF="026674_0180_0FD156A8634D0490">
&s;tone, into the hands of tho&s;e unfeeling wretches, who&s;e ten|der mercies may be termed cruel.</P>
<P N="27">27. It was &s;oon carried off by a hunting party of tho&s;e Indians, to a place called Me&s;&s;i&s;kow, at the lower end of Lake Champlain, whither, in about a month after, it was my fortune to follow them. And here I found it, it is true, but in a condition that afforded me no great &s;atisfac|tion; it being greatly emaciated, and almo&s;t &s;tarved.</P>
<P N="28">28. I took it in my arms, put its face to mine, and it in&s;tantly bit me with &s;uch violence, that it &s;eemed as if I mu&s;t have parted with a piece of my cheek. I was per|mitted to lodge with it that, and the two following nights; but every morning that intervened, the Indians, I &s;uppo&s;e on purpo&s;e to torment me, &s;ent me away to another wig|wam, which &s;tood at a little di&s;tance, though not &s;o far from the one in which my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed infant was confined, but that I could plainly hear its ince&s;&s;ant cries, and heart-rending lamentations.</P>
<P N="29">29. In this deplorable condition, I was obliged to take my leave of it, on the morning of the third day after my ar|rival at the place. We moved down the Lake &s;everal miles the &s;ame day; and the night following was remark|able on account of the <HI>great earthquake</HI> which terribly &s;hook that howling wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P N="30">30. Among the i&s;lands hereabouts, we &s;pent the winter &s;ea&s;on, often &s;hifting our quarters, and roving about from one place to another&punc; our family con&s;i&s;ting of three per&s;ons only, be&s;ides my&s;elf, viz. my late mother's daughter, whom therefore I called my &s;i&s;ter, her &s;anhop, and a pap|poo&s;e.</P>
<P N="31">31. They once left me alone two di&s;mal nights; and when they returned to me again, perceiving them &s;mile at each other, I a&s;ked what is the matter? They replied, that two of my children were no more. One of which, they &s;aid, died a natural death, and the other was knocked on the head.</P>
<P N="32">32. I did not utter many words, but my heart was &s;ore|ly pained within me, and my mind exceedingly troubled with &s;trange and awful ideas. I often imagined, for in|&s;tance, that I plainly &s;aw the naked carca&s;&s;es of my decea&s;|ed children hanging upon the limbs of the trees, as the In|dians
<PB N="181" REF="026674_0181_0FD156AA278E86A0">
are wont to hang the raw hides of tho&s;e bea&s;ts which they take in hunting.</P>
<P N="33">33. It was not long, however, before it was &s;o ordered by kind Providence, that I &s;hould be relieved in a good mea&s;ure from tho&s;e horrid imaginations; for as I was walk|ing one day upon the ice, ob&s;erving a &s;moak at &s;ome di&s;|tance upon the land, it mu&s;t proceed, thought I, from the fire of &s;ome Indian hut; and who knows but &s;ome one of my poor children may be there.</P>
<P N="34">34. My curio&s;ity, thus excited, led me to the place, and there I found my &s;on Caleb, a little boy between two and three years old, whom I had lately buried, in &s;entiment a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lea&s;t; or rather imagined to have been deprived of life, and perhaps al&s;o denied a decent grave.</P>
<P N="35">35. I found him likewi&s;e in tolerable health and cir|cum&s;tances, under the protection of a fond Indian mother; and moreover had the happine&s;s of lodging with him in my arms one joyful night. Again we &s;hifted our quarters, and when we had travelled eight or ten miles upon the &s;now and ice, came to a place where the Indians manufactured &s;ugar which they extracted from the maple trees.</P>
<P N="36">36. Here an Indian came to vi&s;it us, whom I knew, and who could &s;peak Engli&s;h. He a&s;ked me why I did not go to &s;ee my &s;on Squire. I replied that I had lately been in|formed that he was dead. He a&s;&s;ured me that he was yet alive, and but two or three miles off, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Lake.</P>
<P N="37">37. At my reque&s;t, he gave me the be&s;t directions he could to the place of his abode. I re&s;olved to embrace the fir&s;t opportunity that offered of endeavoring to &s;earch it out. While I was bu&s;y in contemplating this affair, the Indians obtained a little bread, of which they gave me a &s;mall &s;hare.</P>
<P N="38">38. I did not ta&s;te a mor&s;el of it my&s;elf, but &s;aved it all for my poor child, if I &s;hould be &s;o lucky as to find him. At length, having obtained of my keepers leave to be ab&s;ent for one day, I &s;et off early in the morning, and &s;teering, as well as I could, according to the directions which the friendly Indian had given me, I quickly found the place, which he had &s;o accurately marked out.</P>
<P N="39">39. I beheld, as I drew nigh, my little &s;on without the camp; but he looked, thought I, like a &s;tarved and mangy
<PB N="182" REF="026674_0182_0FD156AB5A8137A0">
puppy, that had been wallowing in the a&s;hes. I took him in my arms, and he &s;poke to me the&s;e words, in the Indian tongue; "Mother, are you come?"</P>
<P N="40">40. I took him into the wigwam with me, and ob&s;erv|ing a number of Indian children in it, I di&s;tributed all the bread which I had re&s;erved for my own child, among them all; otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have given great offence.</P>
<P N="41">41. My little boy appeared to be very fond of his new mother, kept as near me as po&s;&s;ible while I &s;tayed; and when I told him I mu&s;t go, he fell as though he had been knocked down with a club.</P>
<P N="42">42. But having recommended him to the care of Him who made him, when the day was far &s;pent, and the time would permit me to &s;tay no longer, I departed, you may well &s;uppo&s;e, with a heavy load at my heart. The tidings I had received of the death of my younge&s;t child had, a little before, been confirmed to me beyond a doubt; but I could not mourn &s;o heartily for the decea&s;ed, as for the living child.</P>
<P N="43">43. When the winter broke up, we removed to St. John's; and through the en&s;uing &s;ummer, our principal re&s;i|dence was at no great di&s;tance from the fort at that place. In the mean time, however, my &s;i&s;ter's hu&s;band having been out with a &s;couting party to &s;ome of the Engli&s;h &s;ettle|ments, had a drunken frolic at the fort, when he returned.</P>
<P N="44">44. His wife, who never got drunk, but had often ex|perienced the ill effects of her hu&s;band's intemperance, fear|ing what the con&s;equence might prove, if he &s;hould come home in a moro&s;e and turbulent humor, to avoid his in&s;o|lence, propo&s;ed that we &s;hould both retire, and keep out of the reach of it, until the &s;torm abated.</P>
<P N="45">45. We ab&s;conded accordingly; but &s;o it happened, that I returned, and ventured into his pre&s;ence, before his wi&s;e had pre&s;umed to come nigh him. I found him in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ig <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am, and in a &s;urly mood; and not being able to re|venge upon his wife, becau&s;e &s;he was not at home, he laid hold of me, and hurried me to the for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and, for a trifling con&s;ideration, &s;old me to a French gentleman, who&s;e name was S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee.</P>
<P N="46">46. It is an ill wind certainly that blows nobody any good. I had been with the Indians a year lacking fourteen
<PB N="183" REF="026674_0183_0FD156AFEE1AB430">
days; and, if not for my &s;i&s;ter, yet for me, it was a lucky circum&s;tance indeed, which thus at la&s;t in an unexpected moment, &s;natched me out of their cruel hands, and placed me beyond the reach of their in&s;olent power.</P>
<P N="47">47. After my Indian ma&s;ter had di&s;po&s;ed of me in the manner related above, and the moment of &s;ober reflection had arrived, perceiving that the man who bought me had taken the advantage of him in an unguarded hour, his re|&s;entment began to kindle, and his indignation ro&s;e &s;o high, that he threatened to kill me if he &s;hould meet me alone; or if he could not revenge him&s;elf thus, that he would &s;et fire to the fort.</P>
<P N="48">48. I was therefore &s;ecreted in an upper chamber, and the fort carefully guarded, until his wrath had time to cool. My &s;ervice in the family to which I was advanced, was perfect freedom, in compari&s;on with what it had been among the barbarous Indians.</P>
<P N="49">49. My new ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s were both as kind and generous towards me as I could rea&s;onably expect. I &s;el|dom a&s;ked a favor of either of them, but it was readily granted. In con&s;equence of which I had it in my power, in many in&s;tances, to admini&s;ter aid and refre&s;hment to the poor pri&s;oners of my own nation, who were brought into St. John's during my abode in the family of the above|mentioned benevolent and ho&s;pitable Saccapee.</P>
<P N="50">50. Yet even in this family, &s;uch trials awaited me as I had little rea&s;on to expect; but &s;tood in need of a large &s;tock of prudence, to enable me to encounter them. In this I was greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the governor, and Col. Schuy|ler, who was then a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P N="51">51. I was moreover under un&s;peakable obligations to the governor on another account. I had received intelli|gence from my daughter Mary, the purport of which was, that there was a pro&s;pect of her being &s;hortly married to a young Indian of the tribe of St. Francois, with which tribe &s;he had continued from the beginning of her captivity. The&s;e were heavy tidings, and added greatly to the poig|nancy of my other afflictions.</P>
<P N="52">52. However, not long after I had heard this melan|choly news, an opportunity pre&s;ented of acquainting that humane and generous gentleman, the commander in chief,
<PB N="184" REF="026674_0184_0FD156B1FB5291B8">
and my illu&s;trious benefactor, with this affair al&s;o, who in compa&s;&s;ion for my &s;ufferings, and to mitigate my &s;orrows, i&s;&s;ued his orders in good time, and had my daughter taken away from the Indians, and conveyed to the &s;ame nunnery where her &s;i&s;ter was then lodged, with his expre&s;s injunc|tion, that they &s;hould both of them together be well looked after, and carefully educated, as his adopted children.</P>
<P N="53">53. In this &s;chool of &s;uper&s;tition and bigotry, they continued while the war in tho&s;e days between France and Great-Britain la&s;ted. At the conclu&s;ion of which war, the governor went home to France, took my olde&s;t daugh|ter along with him, and married her there to a French gen|tleman, who&s;e name is Cron Lewis.</P>
<P N="54">54. He was at Bo&s;ton with the fleet under Count de E&s;taing, (1778) and one of his clerks. My other daugh|ter &s;till continuing in the nunnery, a con&s;iderable time had elap&s;ed after my return from captivity, when I made a jour|ney to Canada, re&s;olving to u&s;e my be&s;t endeavors not to return without her.</P>
<P N="55">55. I arrived ju&s;t in time to prevent her being &s;ent to France. She was to have gone in the next ve&s;&s;el that &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l|ed for that place. And I found it extremely difficult to prevail with her to quit the nunnery and go home with me.</P>
<P N="56">56. Yea, &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; and all the per&s;ua&s;ions and arguments I could u&s;e with her, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re to no effect, un|til after I had been to the governor, and obtained a letter from him to the &s;uperintendent of the nuns, in which he threatened, if my daughter &s;hould not be delivered imme|diately into my hands, or could not be prevailed with to &s;ubmit to my parental authority, that he would &s;end a band of &s;oldiers to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in bringing her away.</P>
<P N="57">57. But &s;o extremely bigotted was &s;he to the cu&s;toms and religion of the place, that after all, &s;he left it with the greate&s;t reluctance, and the mo&s;t bitter lamentations, which &s;he continued as we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treets, and wholly refu&s;ed to be comforted. My good friend, Major Small, whom we met with on the way, tried all he could to con&s;ole her; and was &s;o very kind and obliging as to bear us company, and carry my daughter behind him on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P N="58">58. But I have run on a little before my &s;tory; for I have not yet informed you of the means and manner of my
<PB N="185" REF="026674_0185_0FD156B412BF06C8">
own redemption, to the accompli&s;hing of which, the recov|ery of my daughter ju&s;t mentioned, and the ran&s;oming of &s;ome of my other children, &s;everal gentlemen of note con|tributed not a little; to who&s;e goodne&s;s, therefore, I am greatly indebted, and &s;incerely hope I &s;hall never be &s;o un|grateful as to forget it.</P>
<P N="59">59. Col. Schuyler, in particular, was &s;o very kind and generous as to advance 2700 livres to procure a ran&s;om for my&s;elf and three of my children. He accompanied and conducted us from Montreal to Albany, and entertained us in the mo&s;t friendly and ho&s;pitable manner a con&s;idera|ble time, at his own hou&s;e, and I believe entirely at his own expen&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM THE SPEECH OF MR. PITT IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT,
<DATE>JAN. 20, 1775.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RISE with a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee the&s;e papers brought to your table at &s;o late a period of this bu&s;ine&s;s; papers, to tell us what? Why, what all the world knew before; that the Americans, irritated by repeated injuries, and &s;tripped of their inborn rights and deare&s;t privileges, have re&s;i&s;ted, and entered into a&s;&s;ociations for the pre&s;er|vation of their common liberties.</P>
<P N="2">2. Had the early &s;ituation of the people of Bo&s;ton been attended to, things would not have come to this. But the infant complaints of Bo&s;ton were <HI>literally</HI> treated like the capricious <HI>&s;qualls of a child,</HI> who, it was &s;aid, did not know whether it was aggrieved or not.</P>
<P N="3">3. But full well I knew, at that time, that this <HI>child,</HI> if not redre&s;&s;ed, would &s;oon a&s;&s;ume the courage and voice of a <HI>man.</HI> Full well I knew, that the &s;ons of ance&s;tors, born under the &s;ame free con&s;titution, and once breathing the &s;ame liberal air as Engli&s;hmen, would re&s;i&s;t upon the &s;ame principles, and on the &s;ame occa&s;ions.</P>
<P N="4">4. What has government done? They have &s;ent an armed force, con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ting of &s;eventeen thou&s;and men, to dra|goon
<PB N="186" REF="026674_0186_0FD156B53047B5F0">
the Bo&s;tonians into what is called their duty; and, &s;o far from once turning their eyes to the policy and de|&s;tructive con&s;equence of this &s;cheme, are con&s;tantly &s;ending out more troops. And we are told, in the language of menace, that, if &s;eventeen thou&s;and men won't do, fifty thou&s;and &s;hall.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is true, my lords, with this force they may ravage the country; wa&s;te and de&s;troy as they march; but, in the progre&s;s of fifteen hundred miles, can they occupy the places they have pa&s;&s;ed? Will not a country, which can produce three millions of people, wronged and in&s;ulted as they are, &s;tart up like hydras in every corner, and gather fre&s;h &s;trength from fre&s;h oppo&s;ition?</P>
<P N="6">6. Nay, what dependence can you have upon the &s;ol|diery, the unhappy engines of your wrath? They are En|gli&s;hmen, who mu&s;t feel for the privileges of Engli&s;hmen. Do you think that the&s;e men can turn their arms again&s;t their brethren? Surely no. A victory mu&s;t be to them a defeat; and carnage, a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P N="7">7. But it is not merely three millions of people, the produce of America, we have to contend with in this un|natural &s;truggle; many more are on their &s;ide, di&s;per&s;ed over the face of this wide empire. Every whig in this country and in Ireland is with them.</P>
<P N="8">8. Who, then, let me demand, has given, and continues to give, this &s;trange and uncon&s;titutional advice? I do not mean to level at one man, or any particular &s;et of men; but thus much I will venture to declare, that, if his Maje&s;ty continues to hear &s;uch coun&s;ellors, he will not only be bad|ly advi&s;ed, but <HI>undone.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. He may continue indeed to wear his crown; but it will not be worth his wearing. Robbed of &s;o principal a jewel as America, it will lo&s;e its lu&s;tre, and no longer beam that effulgence which &s;hould irradiate the brow of maje&s;ty.</P>
<P N="10">10. In this alarming cri&s;is, I come with this paper in my hand to offer you the be&s;t of my experience and advice, which is, that a humble petition be pre&s;ented to his Ma|je&s;ty, be&s;eeching him, that, in order to open the way to|wards a happy &s;ettlement of the dangerous troubles in America, it may graciou&s;ly plea&s;e him, that immediate or|ders
<PB N="187" REF="026674_0187_0FD156B6BACC9108">
be given to general Gage for removing his Maje&s;ty's forces from the town of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P N="11">11. And this, my lords, upon the mo&s;t mature and de|liberate grounds, is the be&s;t advice I can give you, at this juncture. Such conduct will convince America that you mean to try her cau&s;e in the &s;pirit of <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>inquiry,</HI> and not in <HI>letters of blood.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. There is no time to be lo&s;t. Every hour is big with danger. Perhaps, while I am now &s;peaking, the de|ci&s;ive blow is &s;truck, which may involve millions in the con&s;equence. And, believe me, the very fir&s;t drop of blood which is &s;hed, will cau&s;e a wound which may never be healed.</P>

<HEAD>THE LION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal is produced in Africa, and the hotte&s;t parts of A&s;ia. It is found in the greate&s;t numbers in the &s;corched and de&s;olate regions of the torrid zone, and in all the interior parts of the va&s;t continent of Africa.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the&s;e de&s;ert regions, from whence mankind are driven by the rigorous heat of the climate, this animal reigns &s;ole ma&s;ter. Its di&s;po&s;ition &s;eems to partake of the ardor of its native &s;oil. Enflamed by the influence of a burning &s;un, its rage is mo&s;t tremendous, and its courage undaunted.</P>
<P N="3">3. Happily, indeed, the &s;pecies is not numerous, and is &s;aid to be greatly dimini&s;hed; for, if we may credit the te&s;timony of tho&s;e who have traver&s;ed tho&s;e va&s;t de&s;erts, the number of lions is not nearly &s;o great as formerly.</P>
<P N="4">4. From numberle&s;s accounts, we are a&s;&s;ured that, pow|erful and terrible as this animal is, its anger is noble, its courage magnanimous, and its temper &s;u&s;ceptible of grate|ful impre&s;&s;ions. It has often been &s;een to de&s;pi&s;e weak and contemptible enemies, and even to pardon their in&s;ults when it was in its power to puni&s;h them.</P>
<P N="5">5. It has been known to &s;pare the life of an animal that was thrown to be devoured by it; to live in habits of perfect cordiality with it; to &s;hare its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and even to give it a preference where its portion of food was &s;canty.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="188" REF="026674_0188_0FD156BB1A60EA18">6. The form of the lion is &s;trikingly bold and maje&s;tic. His large and &s;haggy mane, which he can erect at plea&s;ure, &s;urrounding his awful front; his huge eye-brows; his round and fiery eye-balls, which upon the lea&s;t irritation &s;eem to glow with peculiar lu&s;tre; together with the formidable appearance of his teeth, exhibit a picture of terrific gran|deur which no words can de&s;cribe.</P>
<P N="7">7. The length of the large&s;t lion is between eight and nine feet; the tail about four; and its height about four feet and a half. The female is about one fourth part le&s;s, and without a mane.</P>
<P N="8">8. As the lion advances in years its mane grows long|er and thicker. The hair on the re&s;t of the body is &s;hort and &s;mooth, of a tawny color, but whiti&s;h on the belly. Its roaring is loud and dreadful. When heard in the night, it re&s;embles di&s;tant thunder. Its cry of anger is much louder and &s;horter.</P>
<P N="9">9. The lion &s;eldom attacks any animal openly, except when impelled by extreme hunger; in that ca&s;e no danger deters him. But, as mo&s;t animals endeavor to avoid him, he is obliged to have recour&s;e to artifice, and take his prey by &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P N="10">10. For this purpo&s;e, he crouches on his belly in &s;ome thicket, where he waits till his prey approaches; and then, with one prodigious &s;pring, he leaps upon it at the di&s;tance of fifteen or twenty feet, and generally &s;eizes it at the fir&s;t bound.</P>
<P N="11">11. If he mi&s;s his object, he gives up the pur&s;uit; and turning back towards the place of his ambu&s;h, he mea&s;ures the ground &s;tep by &s;tep, and again lies in wait for another opportunity. The lurking places are generally cho&s;en by him near a &s;pring, or by the &s;ide or a river, where he has frequently an opportunity of catching &s;uch animals as come to quench their thir&s;t.</P>
<P N="12">12. The lion is a long-lived animal, although natural|i&s;ts differ greatly as to the preci&s;e period of its exi&s;tence. Of &s;ome that have been trained in the tower of London, one lived to the age of &s;ixty three years, and another ex|ceeded &s;eventy.</P>
<P N="13">13. The a&s;pect of the lion corre&s;ponds with the noble and generous qualities of his mind; his figure is re&s;pecta|ble;
<PB N="189" REF="026674_0189_0FD156BC0DF63BE8">
his looks are determined; his gait is &s;tately, and his voice tremendous. In a word, the body of the lion ap|pears to be the be&s;t model of &s;trength joined to agility.</P>
<P N="14">14. As a proof that he is capable of exerci&s;ing a gen|erous and friendly di&s;po&s;ition towards mankind, we have the following anecdote of one which was kept in the tow|er of London.</P>
<P N="15">15. When this lion was confined in the den alone, an accident happened to the lower part of it, which &s;o impair|ed the wood-work, that he could not be kept with &s;afety; the carpenter was therefore called to repair it, who wi&s;ely &s;tood at a di&s;tance, and would not approach the den for fear of the lion.</P>
<P N="16">16. Upon this, one of the keepers &s;tepped into the den, and engaged to keep the lion at the upper part of his hou&s;e, while the carpenter was at work beneath. It happened, however, that the keeper, after playing &s;ome time with the lion, fell fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P N="17">17. The carpenter continued his work, without know|ing the danger to which he was expo&s;ed; and when he had fini&s;hed his work, called to the keeper to come down and fa&s;ten the door; but received no an&s;wer.</P>
<P N="18">18. He then ran out of the den, and was greatly &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee, through the grate, both the keeper and the lion &s;tretched upon the floor, and &s;leeping together. He called to him again, but the keeper was too &s;ound a&s;leep to return any an&s;wer.</P>
<P N="19">19. The lion however reared up his frightful head, and after looking &s;ome time at the carpenter, threw his huge paw over the keeper's brea&s;t, and laying his no&s;e upon his head, again compo&s;ed him&s;elf to re&s;t.</P>
<P N="20">20. The carpenter already terrified with his own &s;itua|tion, was &s;till more alarmed when he &s;aw the keeper thus encircled with the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the lion, and ran into the hou&s;e for aid.</P>
<P N="21">21. Some of the people came out, and having bolted the den door, which the carpenter had neglected in his precipitate retreat, they rou&s;ed the keeper from his &s;leep, who, &s;haking the lion by the paw, took his leave; but the lion was too well-bred to &s;uffer his friend to go without &s;ome little ceremony or marks of e&s;teem.</P>

<HEAD>STORY OF THE GRATEFUL TURK.</HEAD>
<P>IT is too much to be lamented, that different nations frequently make bloody wars with each other; and when they take any of their enemies pri&s;oners, in&s;tead of u&s;ing them well, and re&s;toring them to liberty, they con|fine them in pri&s;ons, or &s;ell them as &s;laves. The enmity that there has often been between many of the Italian &s;tates, particularly the Venetians and the Turks, is &s;ufficiently known.</P>
<P N="2">2. It once happened that a Venetian &s;hip had taken many of the Turks pri&s;oners, and, according to the barba|rous cu&s;tom I have mentioned, the&s;e unhappy men had been &s;old to different per&s;ons in the city. By accident one of the &s;laves lived oppo&s;ite to the hou&s;e of a rich Venetian, who had an only &s;on, of about the age of twelve years.</P>
<P N="3">3. It happened that this little boy u&s;ed frequently to &s;top as he pa&s;&s;ed near Hamet, for that was the name of the &s;lave, and gaze at him very attentively. Hamet, who re|marked in the face of the child the appearance of good-na|ture and compa&s;&s;ion, u&s;ed always to &s;alute him with the greate&s;t courte&s;y, and te&s;tified the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in his company.</P>
<P N="4">4. At length the little boy took &s;uch a fancy to the &s;lave, that he u&s;ed to vi&s;it him &s;everal times in the day, and brought him &s;uch little pre&s;ents as he had it in his power to make, and which he thought would be of u&s;e to his friend.</P>
<P N="5">5. But though Hamet &s;eemed always to take the great|e&s;t delight in the innocent care&s;&s;es of his little friend, yet the child could not help remarking that Hamet was fre|quently extremely &s;orrowful; and he often &s;urpri&s;ed him on a &s;udden, when tears were trickling down his face, al|though he did his utmo&s;t to conceal them.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="191" REF="026674_0191_0FD156BFA15D36C8">6. The little boy was at length &s;o much affected with the repetition of this &s;ight, that he &s;poke of it to his father, and begged him, if he had it in his power, to make poor Hamet happy. The father, who was extremely fond of his &s;on, and be&s;ides, had ob&s;erved that he &s;eldom reque&s;t|ed any thing which was not generous and humane, deter|mined to &s;ee the Turk him&s;elf, and talk to him.</P>
<P N="7">7. Accordingly he went to him the next day, and ob|&s;erving him for &s;ome time in &s;ilence, was &s;truck with the extraordinary appearance of mildne&s;s and hone&s;ty which his countenance di&s;covered. At length he &s;aid to him, Are you that Hamet of whom my &s;on is &s;o fond, and of who&s;e gentlene&s;s and courte&s;y I have &s;o often heard him talk?</P>
<P N="8">8. Yes, &s;aid the Turk, I am that unfortunate Hamet, who have now been for three years a captive: during that &s;pace of time, your &s;on, if you are his father, is the only human being that &s;eems to have felt any compa&s;&s;ion for my &s;ufferings; therefore, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, he is the only object to which I am attached in this barbarous country; and night and morning I pray that Power, who is equally the God of Turks and Chri&s;tians, to grant him every ble&s;&s;ing he de&s;erves, and to pre&s;erve him from all the mi&s;eries I &s;uffer.</P>
<P N="9">9. Indeed, Hamet, &s;aid the merchant, he is much obliged to you, although from his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, he does not appear much expo&s;ed to danger. But tell me, for I wi&s;h to do you good, in what can I a&s;&s;i&s;t you? for my &s;on informs me that you are the prey of continual re|gret and &s;orrow.</P>
<P N="10">10. Is it wonderful, an&s;wered the Turk, with a glow of generous indignation that &s;uddenly animated his counte|nance, is it wonderful that I &s;hould pine in &s;ilence, and mourn my fate, who am bereft of the fir&s;t and noble&s;t pre&s;|ent of nature, my liberty? And yet, an&s;wered the Vene|tian, how many thou&s;ands of our nation do you retain in fetters?</P>
<P N="11">11. I am not an&s;werable, &s;aid the Turk, for the cruelty of my countrymen, more than you are for the barbarity of yours. But as to my&s;elf, I have never practi&s;ed the inhu|man cu&s;tom of en&s;laving my fellow-creatures: I have never
<PB N="192" REF="026674_0192_0FD156C130A55E80">
&s;poiled Venetian merchants of their property to increa&s;e my riches; I have always re&s;pected the rights of nature, and therefore it is the more &s;evere&mdash;</P>
<P N="12">12. Here a tear &s;tarted from his eye, and wetted his manly cheek: in&s;tantly, however, he recollected him&s;elf, and folding his arms upon his bo&s;om, and gently bowing his head, he added, God is good, and man mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his decrees. The Venetian was affected with this appear|ance of manly fortitude, and &s;aid, Hamet, I pity your &s;uf|ferings, and may perhaps be able to relieve them. What would you do to regain your liberty?</P>
<P N="13">13. What would I do! an&s;wered Hamet; I would confront every pain and danger that can appal the heart of man. Nay, an&s;wered the merchant, you will not be expo|&s;ed to &s;uch a trial. The means of your deliverance are cer|tain, provided your courage does not belie your appearance.</P>
<P N="14">14. Name them! name them! cried the impatient Hamet; place death before me in every horrid &s;hape, and if I &s;hrink&mdash;Patience, an&s;wered the merchant, we &s;hall be ob&s;erved. But hear me attentively. I have in this city an inveterate foe, who has heaped upon me every injury which can mo&s;t bitterly &s;ting the heart of man.</P>
<P N="15">15. This man is brave as he is haughty; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s that the dread of his &s;trength and valor has hitherto deterred me from re&s;enting his in&s;ults as they de&s;erve. Now, Hamet, your look, your form, your words, convince me that you are born for manly daring.</P>
<P N="16">16. Take this dagger; and as &s;oon as the &s;hades of night involve the city, I will my&s;elf conduct you to the place, where you may at once revenge your friend, and re|gain your freedom.</P>
<P N="17">17. At this propo&s;al, &s;corn and &s;hame fla&s;hed from the kindling eye of Hamet, and pa&s;&s;ion for a con&s;iderable time deprived him of the power of utterance; at length he lift|ed his arms as high as his chains would permit, and cried with an indignant tone, Mighty Prophet! and are the&s;e the wretches to which you permit your faithful votaries to be en&s;laved?</P>
<P N="18">18. Go, ba&s;e Chri&s;tian, and know that Hamet would not &s;toop to the vile trade of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, for all the wealth of Venice! no, not to purcha&s;e the freedom of all his race!
<PB N="193" REF="026674_0193_0FD156C29D687140">
At the&s;e words, the merchan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, without &s;eeming much aba&s;h|ed, told him he was &s;orry he had offended him; but that he thought freedom had been dearer to him than he found it was.</P>
<P N="19">19. However, added he, as he turned his back, you will reflect upon my propo&s;al, and perhaps by to-morrow you may change your mind. Hamet di&s;dained to an&s;wer, and the merchant went his way.</P>
<P N="20">20. The next day, however, he returned in compa|ny with his &s;on, and mildly acco&s;ted Hamet thus; The abruptne&s;s of the propo&s;al I ye&s;terday made you might perhaps a&s;toni&s;h you; but I am now come to di&s;cour&s;e the matter more calmly with you, and I doubt not, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en you have heard my rea&s;ons&mdash;</P>
<P N="21">21. Chri&s;tian, interrupted Hamet, with a &s;evere, but compo&s;ed countenance, cea&s;e at length to in&s;ult the mi&s;e|rable with propo&s;als more &s;hocking than even the&s;e chains. If thy religion permit &s;uch acts as tho&s;e, know that they are execrable and abominable to the &s;oul of every Mahom|etan: therefore, from this moment let us break off all far|ther intercour&s;e, and be &s;trangers to each other.</P>
<P N="22">22. No, an&s;wered the merchant, flinging him&s;elf into the arms of Hamet, let us from this moment be more clo&s;e|ly linked than ever! Generous man, who&s;e virtues may at once di&s;arm and enlighten thy enemies! fondne&s;s for my &s;on fir&s;t made me intere&s;ted in thy fate; but from the mo|ment that I &s;aw thee ye&s;terday, I determined to &s;et thee free. Therefore, pardon me this unnece&s;&s;ary trial of thy virtue, which has only rai&s;ed thee higher in my e&s;teem.</P>
<P N="23">23. Franci&s;co has a &s;oul which is as aver&s;e to deeds of treachery and blood, as even Hamet him&s;elf. From this moment, generous man, thou art free; thy ran&s;om is already paid, with no other obligation than that of remem|bering the affection of this thy young and faithful friend; and perhaps, hereafter, when thou &s;ee&s;t an unhappy Chri&s;|tian groaning in Turki&s;h fetters, thy genero&s;ity may make thee think of Venice.</P>
<P N="24">24. The feelings of Hamet at this unexpected deliver|ance are not to be de&s;cribed. Franci&s;co put him on board a &s;hip, which was bound to one of the Grecian i&s;lands, and, after taking leave of him in the tendere&s;t manner, forced him to accept of a pur&s;e of gold to pay his expen&s;es.</P>
<P N="25"><PB N="194" REF="026674_0194_0FD156C4E7F3F378">25. Affectionate was the parting of Hamet with his little friend, whom he embraced in an agony of tenderne&s;s, wept over him, and implored Heaven to grant him all the ble&s;&s;ings of this life.</P>
<P N="26">26. About &s;ix months afterwards, one morning, while the family were all in bed, Franci&s;co's hou&s;e was di&s;cover|ed to be on fire, and great part of the hou&s;e was in flames before the family was alarmed. The terrified &s;ervants had but ju&s;t time to awaken Franci&s;co, who was no &s;ooner got into the &s;treet, than the whole &s;tairca&s;e gave way, and fell into the flames.</P>
<P N="27">27&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the merchant thought him&s;elf happy on having &s;aved him&s;elf, it was only for a moment, as he &s;oon recol|lected, that his beloved &s;on was left behind to the mercy of the flames. He &s;unk into the deepe&s;t de&s;pair, when up|on inquiry he found, that his &s;on, who &s;lept in an upper apartment, had been forgotten in the general confu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="28">28. He raved in agonies of grief, and offered half his fortune to any one, who would ri&s;k his life to &s;ave his child. As he was known to be very rich, &s;everal ladders were in&s;tantly rai&s;ed by tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to obtain the reward; but the violence of the flames drove every one down who attempted it.</P>
<P N="29">29. The unfortunate youth then appeared on the top of the hou&s;e, extending his arms, and calling out for aid. The unhappy father became motionle&s;s, and remained in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. At this critical moment, a man ru&s;hed through the crowd, and a&s;cended the talle&s;t ladder, &s;eem|ingly determined to re&s;cue the youth, or peri&s;h in the attempt.</P>
<P N="30">30. A &s;udden gu&s;t of flame bur&s;ting forth, led the peo|ple to &s;uppo&s;e he was lo&s;t; but he pre&s;ently appeared de|&s;cending the ladder with the child in his arms, without re|ceiving any material injury. A univer&s;al &s;hout attended this noble action, and the father, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;ur|pri&s;e, on recovering from his &s;woon, found his child in his arms.</P>
<P N="31">31. After giving vent to the fir&s;t emotions of tender|ne&s;s, he inquired after his generous deliverer, who&s;e fea|tures were &s;o changed by the &s;moak, that they could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed. Franci&s;co immediately pre&s;ented him
<PB N="195" REF="026674_0195_0FD156C6F28E42C0">
with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;e of gold, promi&s;ing the next day to give him the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rd he had offered.</P>
<P N="32">32. The &s;tranger replied, that he &s;hould accept of no reward. Franci&s;co &s;tarted, and thought he knew the voice; when his &s;on flew to the arms of his deliverer, and cried out, "It is my dear Hamet! it is my dear Hamet!"</P>
<P N="33">33. The a&s;toni&s;hment and gratitude of the merchant were equally excited; and retiring from the crowd, he took Hamet with him to a friend's hou&s;e. As &s;oon as they were alone, Franci&s;co inquired by what means he had been a &s;econd time en&s;laved.</P>
<P N="34">34. I will tell you in a few words, &s;aid the gene|rous Turk. When I was taken by the Venetian gallies, my father &s;hared in my captivity. It was his fate, and not my own, which &s;o often made me &s;hed tho&s;e tears, which fir&s;t attracted the notice of your amiable &s;on.</P>
<P N="35">35. As &s;oon as your bounty had &s;et me free, I flew to the Chri&s;tian who had purcha&s;ed my father. I told him, that as I was young and vigorous, and he aged and infirm, I would be his &s;lave in&s;tead of my father.</P>
<P N="36">36. I added too the gold which your bounty had be|&s;towed on me, and by the&s;e means I prevailed on the Chri&s;tian to &s;end back my father in that &s;hip you had pro|vided for me, without his knowing the cau&s;e of his freedom. Since that time I have &s;tayed here a willing &s;lave, and Heaven has been &s;o gracious as to put it into my power to &s;ave the life of that youth, which I value a thou&s;and times more than my own.</P>
<P N="37">37. The merchant was a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch an in&s;tance of gratitude and affection, and pre&s;&s;ed Hamet to accept of the half of his fortune, and to &s;ettle in Venice for the re|mainder of his days. Hamet, however, with a noble mag|nanimity, refu&s;ed the offer, &s;aying, he had done no more than what every one ought to do in a &s;imilar &s;ituation.</P>
<P N="38">38. Though Hamet &s;eemed to under-rate his pa&s;t &s;er|vices to the merchant, yet the latter could not &s;uffer things to pa&s;s in this manner. He again purcha&s;ed his freedom, and fitted a &s;hip out on purpo&s;e to take him back to his own country. At parting, they mutually embraced each other, and, as they thought, took an eternal farewell.</P>
<P N="39"><PB N="196" REF="026674_0196_0FD156C855232DB8">39. After many years had elap&s;ed, and young Franci&s;|co was grown up to manhood, beloved and re&s;pected by every one, it &s;o happened that &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s made it nece&s;|&s;ary for him and his father to vi&s;it a neighboring city on the coa&s;t; and as they &s;uppo&s;ed a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea would be more expeditious than by land, they embarked in a Vene|tian ve&s;&s;el, which was bound to that port, and ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P N="40">40. A favorable gale &s;oon wafted them out of &s;ight, and promi&s;ed them a &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age; but, unfortunately for them, before they had proceeded half their voyage, they were met by &s;ome Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els, who, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance from the Venetians, boarded them, loaded them with irons, and carried them pri&s;oners to Tunis. There they were expo&s;ed in the market-place in their chains, in order to be &s;old as &s;laves.</P>
<P N="41">41. At la&s;t, a Turk came to the market, who &s;eemed to be a man of &s;uperior rank, and after looking over the pri&s;oners, with an expre&s;&s;ion of compa&s;&s;ion, he fixed his eyes upon young Franci&s;co, and a&s;ked the captain what was the price of that young captive.</P>
<P N="42">42. The captain replied, that he would not part with him for le&s;s than five hundred pieces of gold. The Turk con&s;idered that as a very extraordinary price, &s;ince he had &s;een him &s;ell others, that exceeded him in &s;trength and vigor, for le&s;s than a fifth part of that money.</P>
<P N="43">43. That is true, (replied the captain) but he &s;hall either fetch me a price that will repay me the damage he has occa&s;ioned me, or he &s;hall labor all the re&s;t of his life at the oar. The Turk a&s;ked him, what damage he could have done him more than the re&s;t of the crew.</P>
<P N="44">44. It was he (replied the captain) who animated the Chri&s;tians to make a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance, and thereby proved the de&s;truction of many of my brave&s;t &s;eamen: We three times boarded them with a fury that &s;eemed in|vincible, and each time did that youth attack us with a cool and determined oppo&s;ition; &s;o that we were obliged to give up the conte&s;t, till other &s;hips came to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>I</HI> will therefore have that price for him, or I will puni&s;h him for life.</P>
<P N="45"><PB N="197" REF="026674_0197_0FD156C957C213B8">45. The Turk now &s;urveyed young Franci&s;co more attentively than before; and the young man, who had hitherto fixed his eyes in &s;ullen &s;ilence on the ground, at length rai&s;ed them up; but he had no &s;ooner beheld the per&s;on who was talking to the captain, than, in a loud voice, he uttered the name of Hamet. The Turk, &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;urveyed him for a moment, and then caught him in his arms.</P>
<P N="46">46. After a moment's pau&s;e, the generous Hamet lifted up his hands to heaven, and thanked his God, who had put in his power to &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w his gratitude; but words cannot expre&s;s his feelings, when he found that both father and &s;on were &s;laves. Suffice it to &s;ay, that he in&s;tantly bought their freedom, and conducted them to his magnifi|cent hou&s;e in the city.</P>
<P N="47">47. They had here full lei&s;ure to di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, when Hamet told his Vene|tian friends, that after their genero&s;ity had procured him liberty, he became an officer in the Turki&s;h army, and happening to be fortunate in all his enterpri&s;es, he had been gradually promoted, till he arrived at the dignity of ba|&s;haw of Tunis.</P>
<P N="48">48. That in this &s;ituation, he found the greate&s;t con&s;o|lation in alleviating the misfortunes of the Chri&s;tian pri&s;on|ers, and always attended the &s;ales of tho&s;e unhappy &s;laves, to procure liberty to a certain number of them. And gra|cious Allah (added he) has this day put it in my power in &s;ome mea&s;ure to return the duties of gratitude.</P>
<P N="49">49. They continued &s;ome days with Hamet, who did every thing in his power to amu&s;e and divert them; but as he found their de&s;ire was to return to their own country, he told them that he would not detain them again&s;t their wi&s;hes; and that they &s;hould embark the next day in a &s;hip bound for Venice, which would be furni&s;hed with a pa&s;&s;port to carry them &s;afe there.</P>
<P N="50">50. The next day, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with every mark of tenderne&s;s and affection, and ordered a party of his own guards to attend them to the ve&s;&s;el. They had no &s;ooner got on board, than they found, to their inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e and joy, that they were in the very &s;hip in which they had been taken, and that, by the genero&s;ity of Hamet,
<PB N="198" REF="026674_0198_0FD156CAD9576570">
not only the &s;hip, but even the whole crew, were redeemed and re&s;tored to freedom.</P>
<P N="51">51. Franci&s;co and his &s;on, after a quick pa&s;&s;age, arrived in their own country, where they lived beloved and re&s;pect|ed, and endeavored to convince every one they knew, how great were the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, and that God never &s;uffers humanity and genero&s;ity to go unrewarded, here or hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF DEMOSTHENES TO THE ATHE|NIANS, CONCERNING THE REGULATION OF THE STATE.</HEAD>
<P>YOU a&s;k, Athenians, "What real advan|tage have we derived from the &s;peeches of Demo&s;thenes? He ri&s;es when he thinks proper; he deafens us with his harangues; he declaims again&s;t the degeneracy of pre&s;ent
<PB N="202" REF="026674_0202_0FD12B175F6CB550">
times; he tells us of the virtues of our ance&s;tors; he tran&s;+ports us by his airy extravagance; he puffs up our vanity; and then &s;its down."</P>
<P N="2">2. But, could the&s;e my &s;peeches once gain an effectual influence upon your minds, &s;o great would be the advan|tages conferred upon my country, that, were I to attempt to &s;peak them, they would appear to many as vi&s;ionary. Yet &s;till I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume the merit of doing &s;ome &s;ervice, by ac|cu&s;toming you to hear &s;alutary truths.</P>
<P N="3">3. And if your coun&s;ellors be &s;olicitous for any point of moment to their country, let them fir&s;t cure your ears; for they are di&s;tempered; and this, from the inveterate habit of li&s;tening to fal&s;ehoods, to every thing, rather than your real intere&s;ts.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is no man who dares openly and boldly to declare, in what ca&s;e our con&s;titution is &s;ubverted. But I &s;hall declare it. When you, Athenians, become a helple&s;s rabble, without conduct, without property, without arms, without order, without unanimity; when neither your general, nor any other per&s;on, hath the lea&s;t re&s;pect for your decrees; when no man dares to inform you of this your condition, to urge the nece&s;&s;ary reformation, much le&s;s to exert his effort to effect it; then is your con&s;titu|tion &s;ubverted. And this is now the ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. But, O my fellow-citizens! a language of a differ|ent nature hath poured in upon us; fal&s;e, and highly dan|gerous to the State. Such is that a&s;&s;ertion, that in your tribunals is your great &s;ecurity; that your right of &s;uffrage is the real bulwark of the con&s;titution. That the&s;e tribu|nals are our common re&s;ource in all private conte&s;ts, I acknowledge.</P>
<P N="6">6. But, it is by arms we are to &s;ubdue our enemies; by arms we are to defend our State. It is not by our de|crees that we can conquer. To tho&s;e, on the contrary, who &s;ight our battles with &s;ucce&s;s, to the&s;e we owe the power of decreeing, of tran&s;acting all our affairs, without control or danger. In arms, then, let us be terrible; in our judicial tran&s;actions, humane.</P>
<P N="7">7. If it be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e &s;entiments are more ele|vated than might be expected from my character; the ob|&s;ervation, I confe&s;s, is ju&s;t. Whatever is &s;aid about a &s;tate
<PB N="203" REF="026674_0203_0FD156D2D00326D0">
of &s;uch dignity, upon affairs of &s;uch importance, &s;hould ap|pear more elevated than any character. To your worth &s;hould it corre&s;pond, not to that of the &s;peaker.</P>
<P N="8">8. And now I &s;hall inform you why none of tho&s;e, who &s;tand high in your e&s;teem, &s;peak in the &s;ame manner. The candidates for office and employment go about &s;olicit|ing your voices, the &s;laves of popular favor. To gain the rank of general, is each man's great concern; not to fill this &s;tation with true manlike intrepidity.</P>
<P N="9">9. Courage, if he po&s;&s;e&s;s it, he deems unnece&s;&s;ary; for, thus he rea&s;ons; he has the honor, the renown of this city to &s;upport him; he finds him&s;elf free from oppre&s;&s;ion and control; he needs but to amu&s;e you with fair hopes; and, thus, he &s;ecures a kind of inheritance in your emolu|ments. And he rea&s;ons truly.</P>
<P N="10">10. But, do you your&s;elves once a&s;&s;ume the conduct of your own affairs; and then, as you take an equal &s;hare of duty, &s;o &s;hall you acquire an equal &s;hare of glory. Now, your mini&s;ters and public &s;peakers, without one thought of directing you faithfully to your true intere&s;t, re&s;ign them|&s;elves entirely to the&s;e generals. Formerly you divided into cla&s;&s;es, in order to rai&s;e the &s;upplies; now the bu&s;ine&s;s of the cla&s;&s;es is to gain the management of public affairs.</P>
<P N="11">11. The orator is the leader; the general &s;econds his attempts; the Three Hundred are the a&s;&s;i&s;tants on each &s;ide; and all others take their parties, and &s;erve to fill up the &s;everal factions. And you &s;ee the con&s;equences.</P>
<P N="12">12. This man gains a &s;tatue; this ama&s;&s;es a fortune; one or two command the State; while you &s;it down uncon|cerned, witne&s;&s;es of their &s;ucce&s;s; and, for an uninterrupted cour&s;e of ea&s;e and indolence, give them up tho&s;e great and glorious advantages, which really belong to you.</P>

<HEAD>A FATHER'S ADVICE TO HIS CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>OBSERVE and mark as well as you may, what is the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who&s;e &s;peeches you hear, whether they be grave, &s;erious, &s;ober, wi&s;e, di&s;creet per&s;ons. If they be &s;uch, their &s;peeches
<PB N="204" REF="026674_0204_0FD156D4081D54E0">
commonly are like them&s;elves, and well de&s;erve your atten|tion and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="2">2. But, if they be light, impertinent, vain, pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;ons, their &s;peech is for the mo&s;t part accordingly; and the be&s;t advantage that you will gain by their &s;peech, is but thereby to learn their di&s;po&s;itions; to di&s;cern their failings, and to make your&s;elves the more cautious both in your conver&s;ation with them, and in your own &s;peech and de|portment; for in the un&s;eemline&s;s of their &s;peech you may better di&s;cern and avoid the like in your&s;elves.</P>
<P N="3">3. If any per&s;on, that you do not very well know to be a per&s;on of truth, &s;obriety, and weight, relate &s;trange &s;tories, be not too ready or ea&s;y to believe them, nor report them after him. And yet, unle&s;s he be one of your familiar ac|quaintance, be not too forward to contradict him; or if the nece&s;&s;ity of the occa&s;ion require you to declare your opinion of what is &s;o reported, let it be mode&s;tly and gently, not too bluntly or coar&s;ely. By this mean, on the one &s;ide you will avoid being abu&s;ed by your too much credulity; on the other &s;ide, you will avoid quarrels and di&s;ta&s;te.</P>
<P N="4">4. If any man &s;peak any thing to the di&s;advantage or reproach of one that is ab&s;ent, be not too ready to believe it; only ob&s;erve and remember it, for it may be it is not true, or it is not all true, or &s;ome other circum&s;tances were min|gled with it, which might give the bu&s;ine&s;s reported a ju&s;ti|fication, or at lea&s;t an allay, an extenuation, or a rea&s;ona|ble excu&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. If any per&s;on report unto you &s;ome injury done to you by another, either in words or deeds, do not be over ha&s;ty in believing it; nor &s;uddenly angry with the per&s;on &s;o accu&s;ed; for it is po&s;&s;ible it may be fal&s;e or mi&s;taken; and how un&s;eemly a thing will it be, when your credulity and pa&s;&s;ion &s;hall perchance carry you, upon a &s;uppo&s;ed in|jury, to do wrong to him that hath done you none.</P>
<P N="6">6. When a per&s;on is accu&s;ed or reported to have injur|ed you, before you give your&s;elf leave to be angry, think with your&s;elf, why &s;hould I be angry before I am certain it is true; or if it be true, how can I tell how much I &s;hould be angry, till I know the whole matter? Though it may be he hath done me wrong, yet po&s;&s;ibly it is mi&s;repre|&s;ented, or it was done by mi&s;take, or it may be he is &s;orry for it.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="205" REF="026674_0205_0FD156D588F6A998">7. I will not be angry till I know there be cau&s;e, and if there be cau&s;e, yet I will not be angry till I know the whole cau&s;e; for till then, if I mu&s;t be angry at all, yet I know not how much to be angry; it may be it is not worth my anger, or if it be, it may be it de&s;erves but a lit|tle. This will keep your mind and carriage upon &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions in a due temper and order; and will di&s;appoint ma|licious or officious tale-bearers.</P>
<P N="8">8. If a man, who&s;e integrity you do not very well know, make you great and extraordinary profe&s;&s;ions and promi&s;es, give him as kind thanks as may be, but give not much cred|it to it. Ca&s;t about with your&s;elf what may be the rea&s;on of his wonderful kindne&s;s; it is twenty to one but you will find &s;omething that he aims at, be&s;ide kindne&s;s to you.</P>
<P N="9">9. If a man flatter and commend you to your face, or to one that he thinks will tell you of it; it is a thou&s;and to one, either he hath deceived and abu&s;ed you &s;ome way, or means to do &s;o. Remember the fable of the fox commend|ing the &s;inging of the crow, when &s;he had &s;omew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> in her mouth that the fox liked.</P>
<P N="10">10. If a per&s;on be choleric, pa&s;&s;ionate, and give you ill language, remember, fir&s;t, rather to pity him than to be moved into anger and pa&s;&s;ion with him; for mo&s;t certainly that man is in a di&s;temper, and di&s;ordered. Ob&s;erve him calmly, and you &s;hall &s;ee in him &s;o much perturbation and di&s;turbance, that you will ea&s;ily believe he is not a pattern to be imitated by you, and therefore return not choler for anger; for you do but put your&s;elf into a kind of frenzy becau&s;e you &s;ee him &s;o.</P>
<P N="11">11. Be &s;ure you return not railing, reproaching, or re|viling for reviling; for it doth but kindle more heat, and you will find &s;ilence, or at lea&s;t very gentle words, the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite revenge for reproaches that can be; for either it will cure the di&s;temper in the other, and make him &s;ee and be &s;orry for his pa&s;&s;ion, or it will torment him with more perturbation and di&s;turbance.</P>
<P N="12">12. Some men are excellent in the knowledge of hu&s;|bandry, &s;ome of planting, &s;ome of gardening, &s;ome in the mathematics, &s;ome in one kind, &s;ome in another; in all your conver&s;ation, learn as near as you can wherein the &s;kill and excellence of any per&s;on lies, and put him upon
<PB N="206" REF="026674_0206_0FD156D58FFE0268">
talk of that &s;ubject, and ob&s;erve it, and keep it in memory or writing; by this mean you will glean up the worth and excellence of every per&s;on you meet with, and at an ea&s;y rate put together that which may be for your u&s;e upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P N="13">13. Conver&s;e not with a liar or a &s;wearer, or a man of ob&s;cene or wanton language; for either he will corrupt you, or at lea&s;t it will hazard your reputation to be one of the like making. And if it doth neither, yet it will fill your memory with &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es, that will be trouble&s;ome to you in after-time, and the returns of the remembrance of the pa&s;&s;ages which you long &s;ince heard of this nature, will haunt you, when your thoughts &s;hould be better employed.</P>
<P N="14">14. Let your &s;peech be true; never &s;peak any thing for a truth which you know or believe to be fal&s;e. It is a great &s;in again&s;t God who gave you a tongue, to &s;peak your offence again&s;t humanity it&s;elf; for where there is no truth, there can be no &s;afe &s;ociety between man and man.</P>
<P N="15">15. As you mu&s;t be careful not to lie, &s;o you mu&s;t avoid coming near to it; you mu&s;t not equivocate, you mu&s;t not &s;peak that ab&s;olutely, which you have but by hear &s;ay or relation; you mu&s;t not &s;peak that as upon knowledge which you have but by conjecture or opinion only.</P>
<P N="16">16. Let your words be few, e&s;pecially when your bet|ters, or &s;trangers, or men of experience or under&s;tanding, are pre&s;ent; for you do your&s;elf at once two great mi&s;chiefs. Fir&s;t, you betray and di&s;cover your own weakne&s;s and fol|ly. Secondly, you rob your&s;elf of that opportunity which you might otherwi&s;e have to gain knowledge, wi&s;dom, and experience, by hearing tho&s;e whom you &s;ilence by your im|per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inent talking.</P>
<P N="17">17. Be not over earne&s;t, loud, or violent in talking; for it is un&s;een<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly; and earne&s;t and loud talking make you over|&s;hoot and lo&s;e your bu&s;ine&s;s. When you &s;hould be con&s;id|ering and pondering your thoughts, and how to expre&s;s them &s;ignificantly, and to the purpo&s;e, you are &s;triving to keep your tongue going, and to &s;ilence an opponent, not with rea&s;on but with noi&s;e.</P>
<P N="18">18. Be careful not to interrupt another in his talk; hear him out; you will under&s;tand him the better, and be able to give him the better an&s;wer. It may be, if you will give
<PB N="207" REF="026674_0207_0FD156D7873A1CE8">
him leave, he will &s;ay &s;omething more than you have yet heard, or well under&s;tood, or that which you did not expect.</P>
<P N="19">19. Always before you &s;peak, e&s;pecially where the bu|&s;ine&s;s is of moment, con&s;ider beforehand, weigh the &s;en&s;e of your mind, which you intend to utter; think upon the ex|pre&s;&s;ions you intend to u&s;e, that they may be &s;ignificant, pertinent, and inoffen&s;ive; and whereas it is the ordinary cour&s;e of incon&s;iderate per&s;ons to &s;peak their words, and then to think, or not to think till they &s;peak; think fir&s;t and &s;peak after; if it be in any matter of moment or &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="20">20. Be &s;ure you give not an ill report to any that you are not &s;ure de&s;erves it. And in mo&s;t ca&s;es, though a man de&s;erve ill, yet you &s;hould be &s;paring to report him &s;o. In &s;ome ca&s;es indeed you are bound, in hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice, to give that account concerning the demerit or default of a per&s;on that he de&s;erves.</P>
<P N="21">21. Avoid &s;coffing, and bitter and biting jeering, and je&s;ting, e&s;pecially at the condition, credit, deformity, or natural defects of any per&s;on; for the&s;e leave a deep im|pre&s;&s;ion, and are mo&s;t apparent inju&s;tice; for, were you &s;o u&s;ed, you would take it ami&s;s; and many times &s;uch an in|jury co&s;ts a man dear, when he little thinks of it.</P>
<P N="22">22. Be very careful that you give no reproachful, bitter, menacing, or &s;piteful words to any per&s;on, nay not to &s;er|vants or other per&s;ons of an inferior condition. There is no per&s;on &s;o mean but that you may &s;tand in need of him in one kind, or at &s;ome time or another.

<P N="3">3. You know too well the forces which compo&s;e their army to dread their &s;uperior numbers. A few regular troops from Old France, weakened by hunger and &s;ickne&s;s, who when fre&s;h were unable to with&s;tand Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, are their General's chief dependence.</P>

You can now only con&s;ider them as the ju&s;t objects of a &s;evere revenge for the unhap|py fate of many &s;laughtered countrymen.</P>

<HEAD>FOSCARI, THE UNFORTUNATE VE|NETIAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t affecting in&s;tance of the odious in|flexibility of Venetian courts, appears in the ca&s;e of Fo&s;cari, &s;on to the Doge of that name. This young man had, by &s;ome imprudences, given offence to the Senate, and was, by their orders, confined at Trevi&s;o, when Almor Donato, one of the Council of Ten, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, on the 5th of November, 1450, as he entered his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. A reward, in ready money, with pardon for this or any other crime, and a pen&s;ion of two hundred ducats, re|vertible to children, was promi&s;ed to any per&s;on who would di&s;cover the planner or perpetrator of this crime. No &s;uch di&s;covery was made.</P>
<P N="3">3. One of young Fo&s;cari's footmen, named Olivier, had been ob&s;erved loitering near Donato's hou&s;e, on the evening of the murder; he fled from Venice next morning. The&s;e, with other circum&s;tances of le&s;s importance, created a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion that Fo&s;cari had engaged this man to commit the murder.</P>
<P N="4">4. Olivier was taken, brought to Venice, put to the torture, and confe&s;&s;ed nothing; yet the Council of Ten, being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opinion of their guilt, and ima|gining that the ma&s;ter would have le&s;s re&s;olution, u&s;ed him in the &s;ame cruel manner. The unhappy young man, in the mid&s;t of his agony, continued to a&s;&s;ert, that he knew nothing of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P N="5">5. This convinced the Court of his firmne&s;s, but not of his innocence; yet as there was no legal proof of his guilt, they could not &s;entence him to death. He was condemned to pa&s;s the re&s;t of his life in bani&s;hment, at Canea, in the i&s;land of Candia.</P>
<P N="6">6. This unfortunate youth bore his exile with more impatience than he had done the rack; he often wrote to his relations and friends, praying them to intercede in his behalf, that the term of his bani&s;hment might be abridged, and that he might be permitted to return to his family be|fore he died. All his applications were fruitle&s;s; tho&s;e
<PB N="217" REF="026674_0217_0FD156EA91D571E8">
to whom he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf had never interfered in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> favor, for fear of giving offence to the obdurate Council&punc; or had interfered in vain.</P>
<P N="7">7. After langui&s;hing five years in exile, having lo&s;t all hope of return, through the interpo&s;ition of his own family or countrymen, in a fit of de&s;pair he addre&s;&s;ed the Duke of Milan, putting him in mind of &s;ervices which the Dog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, his father, had rendered him, and begging that he would u&s;e his powerful influence with the State of Venice, that his &s;entence might be recalled.</P>
<P N="8">8. He entru&s;ted his letter to a merchant, going from Canea to Venice, who promi&s;ed to take the fir&s;t opportu|nity of &s;ending it from thence to the Duke; in&s;tead of which, this wretch, as &s;oon as he arrived at V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ice, deliv|ered it to the chiefs of the Council of Ten.</P>
<P N="9">9. This conduct of young Fo&s;cari appeared criminal in the eyes of tho&s;e Judges; for by the laws of the republic, all its &s;ubjects are expre&s;sly forbidden claiming the protec|tion of foreign princes, in any thing which relates to the government of Venice.</P>
<P N="10">10. Fo&s;cari was therefore ordered to be brought from Candia, and &s;hut up in the State pri&s;on. There the chiefs of the Council of Ten ordered him once more to be put to the torture, to draw from him the motives which deter|mined him to apply to the Duke of Milan. Such an ex|ertion of law is, indeed, the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="11">11. The mi&s;erable youth declared to the Council, that he wrote the letter in the full per&s;ua&s;ion that the merchant, who&s;e character he knew, would betray him, and deliver it to them; the con&s;equence of which, he fore&s;aw, would be, his being ordered back a pri&s;oner to Venice, the only means he had in his power of &s;eeing his parents and friends; a plea&s;ure for which he had langui&s;hed, with un|&s;urmountable de&s;ire, for &s;ome time, and which he was willing to purcha&s;e at the expen&s;e of any danger or pain.</P>
<P N="12">12. The Judges, little affected with this generous in|&s;tance of filial piety, ordained, that the unhappy young man &s;hould be carried back to Candia, and there be im|pri&s;oned for a year, and remain bani&s;hed to that i&s;land fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> life; with this condition, that if he &s;hould make any mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

applications to foreign powers, his impri&s;onment &s;hould be perpetual. At the &s;ame time they gave permi&s;&s;ion, that the Doge and his lady might vi&s;it their unfortunate &s;on.</P>
<P N="13">13. The Doge was, at this time, very old; he had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the office above thirty years. Tho&s;e wretched parents had an interview with their &s;on in one of the apartments of the palace; they embraced him with all the tenderne&s;s which his misfortunes and his filial af|fection de&s;erved.</P>
<P N="14">14. The father exhorted him to bear his hard fate with firmne&s;s. The &s;on prote&s;ted, in the mo&s;t moving terms, that this was not in his power; that however others could &s;upport the di&s;mal loneline&s;s of a pri&s;on, he could not; that his heart was formed for friend&s;hip, and the reciprocal endearments of &s;ocial life; without which, his &s;oul &s;unk into dejection wor&s;e than death, from which alone he &s;hould look for relief, if he &s;hould again be confined to the horrors of a pri&s;on; and, melting into tears, he &s;unk at his father's feet, imploring him to take compa&s;&s;ion on a &s;on who had ever loved him with the mo&s;t dutiful affection, and who was perfectly innocent of the crime of which he was accu&s;ed.</P>
<P N="15">15. He conjured him, by every bond of nature and re|ligion, by the bowels of a father, and the mercy of a Re|deemer, to u&s;e his influence with the Council to mitigate their &s;entence, that he might be &s;aved from the mo&s;t cruel of all deaths, that of expiring under the &s;low tortures of a broken heart, in a horrible bani&s;hment from every creature he loved. "My &s;on," replied the Doge, "&s;ubmit to the laws of your country, and do not a&s;k of me what is not in my power to obtain."</P>
<P N="16">16. Having made this effort, he retired to another apart|ment; and, unable to &s;upport any longer the acutene&s;s of his feelings, &s;unk into a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, in which con|dition he remained till &s;ome time after his &s;on had failed on his return to Candia.</P>
<P N="17">17. Nobody has pre&s;umed to de&s;cribe the angui&s;h of the wretched mother. Tho&s;e who are endowed with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, and who have experienced di&s;|tre&s;&s;es in &s;ome degree &s;imilar, will have the ju&s;te&s;t idea of what it was.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="219" REF="026674_0219_0FD156EFF53AE460">18. The accumulated mi&s;ery of tho&s;e unhappy parents touched the hearts of &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful Senators, who applied with &s;o much energy for a complete pardon for young Fo&s;cari, that they were on the point of obtaining it; when a ve&s;&s;el arrived from Candia, with tidings, that the mi&s;erable youth had expired in pri&s;on a &s;hort time af|ter his return.</P>
<P N="19">19. Some years after this, Nicholas Erizzo, a noble Venetian, being on his death-bed, confe&s;&s;ed that, bearing a violent re&s;entment again&s;t the Senator Donato, he had committed the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination for which the unhappy family of Fo&s;cari had &s;uffered &s;o much.</P>
<P N="20">20. At this time the &s;orrows of the Doge were at an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd; he had exi&s;ted only a few months after the death of his &s;on. His life had been prolonged, till he beheld his &s;on per&s;ecuted to death for an infamous crime; but not till he &s;hould &s;ee this foul &s;tain wa&s;hed from his family, and the innocence of his beloved &s;on made manife&s;t to the world.</P>
<P N="21">21. The ways of Heaven never appeared more dark and intricate, than in the incidents and cata&s;trophe of this mournful &s;tory. To reconcile the permi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch events to our ideas of infinite power and goodne&s;s, however diffi|cult, is a natural attempt in the human mind, and has exer|ci&s;ed the ingenuity of philo&s;ophers in all ages, while, in the eye of Chri&s;tians, tho&s;e &s;eeming perplexities afford an addi|tional proof, that there will be a future &s;tate in which the ways of God to man will be fully ju&s;tified.</P>

<HEAD>PART OF CICERO'S ORATION AGAINST VERRES.</HEAD>
<P>I ASK now, Verres, what you have to ad|vance again&s;t this charge? Will you pretend to deny it? Will you pretend that any thing fal&s;e, that even any thing aggravated is alleged again&s;t you?</P>
<P N="2">2. Had any prince, or any &s;tate, committed the &s;ame outrage again&s;t the privilege of Roman citizens, &s;hould we
<PB N="220" REF="026674_0220_0FD156F1DB47EAD0">
not think we had &s;ufficient rea&s;on for declaring immediate war again&s;t them?</P>
<P N="3">3. What puni&s;hment, then, ought to be inflicted upon a tyrannical and wicked praetor, who dared, at no greater di&s;tance than Sicily, within &s;ight of the Italian coa&s;t, to put to the infamous death of crucifixion that unfortunate and innocent citizen, Publius Gavius Cofanus, only for his hav|ing a&s;&s;erted his privilege of citizen&s;hip, and declared his intention of appealing to the ju&s;tice of his country again&s;t a cruel oppre&s;&s;or, who had unju&s;tly confined him in pri&s;on at Syracu&s;e, whence he had ju&s;t made his e&s;cape?</P>
<P N="4">4. The unhappy man, arre&s;ted as he was going to em|bark for his native country, is brought before the wicked praetor. With eyes darting fury, and a countenance di&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orted with cruelty, he orders the helple&s;s victim of his rage to be &s;tripped, and rods to be brought; accu&s;ing him, but without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of evidence, or even of &s;u&s;|picion, of having come to Sicily as a &s;py.</P>
<P N="5">5. It was in vain that the unhappy man cried out, "I am a Roman citizen; I have &s;erved under Lucius Pretius, who is now at Panormus, and will atte&s;t my innocence." The blood-thir&s;ty praetor, deaf to all he could urge in his own defence, ordered the infamous puni&s;hment to be in|flicted.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus, fathers, was an innocent Roman citizen pub|lickly mangled with &s;courging; whil&s;t the only words he uttered amid&s;t his cruel &s;ufferings were, "I am a Roman citizen!" With the&s;e he hoped to defend him&s;elf from vi|olence and infamy. But of &s;o little &s;ervice was this privi|lege to him, that while he was a&s;&s;erting his citizen&s;hip, the order was given for his execution; for his execution upon the cro&s;s!</P>
<P N="7">7. O Liberty! O &s;ound, once delightful to every Ro|man ear! O &s;acred privilege of Roman citizen&s;hip! once &s;acred! now trampled upon! But what then! Is it come to this? Shall an inferior magi&s;trate, a governor, who holds his power of the Roman people, in a Roman province, within &s;ight of Italy, bind, &s;courge, torture with fire and red-hot plates of iron, and at la&s;t put to the infamous death of the cro&s;s, a Roman citizen?</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="221" REF="026674_0221_0FD156F3D59442F0">8.

<P N="9">9. I conclude with expre&s;&s;ing my hopes, that your wi&s;|dom and ju&s;tice, fathers, will not, by &s;uffering the atrocious and unexampled in&s;olence of Caius Verres to e&s;cape the due puni&s;hment, leave room to apprehend the danger of a total &s;ubver&s;ion of authority, and introduction of general an|archy and confu&s;ion.</P>

<P>I AM truly &s;en&s;ible of the important tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in me, and cannot but feel a &s;olicitude to di&s;charge it with propriety. I will not &s;ay that the pecuniary emolu|ment ari&s;ing from it is by any means indifferent to me. No man would &s;acrifice his ea&s;e, and enter into an anxious em|ployment, without a de&s;ire of tho&s;e rewards which are al|lotted to indu&s;try.</P>
<P N="2">2. And it is equitable that he, who is willing to &s;tep forward and render him&s;elf exten&s;ively u&s;eful to others, &s;hould derive &s;uch advantages from his exertions, as may render his old age ea&s;y and re&s;pected, or provide for the wants of a ri&s;ing family.</P>
<P N="3">3. But I mu&s;t declare, on the other hand, that the &s;at|isfaction ari&s;ing from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of performing the du|ty incumbent on me, and rendering a &s;ervice equivalent to the recompen&s;e, &s;weetens every labor, and gives additional value to the pecuniary compen&s;ation.</P>
<P N="4">4. You are placed here for two purpo&s;es; the improve|ment of the under&s;tanding, and the formation of virtuous principles for the guidance of your moral conduct. Im|provement of the under&s;tanding is apparently the fir&s;t object in your entrance at &s;chool; but it cannot be doubted but that improvement of the heart is really e&s;teemed by tho&s;e to whom you are mo&s;t dear, at a higher price than the fine&s;t accompli&s;hment of the mo&s;t cultivated intellect.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is your bu&s;ine&s;s to unite the&s;e e&s;timable objects, and to &s;uffer your hearts and under&s;tandings to vie with each other in the pur&s;uit of excellence. The principal pur|po&s;e of my frequent addre&s;&s;es is to promote the knowledge and the practice of the Chri&s;tian religion; and in the per|formance of this purpo&s;e, I &s;hall of nece&s;&s;ity be led to rec|ommend the pure&s;t &s;y&s;tem of morality. Ethics, improved and exalted by the Chri&s;tian religion, become the guides to real wi&s;dom and &s;olid happine&s;s, to which they could nev|er attain when taught only in the &s;chools of heathen phi|lo&s;ophy.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="226" REF="026674_0226_0FD15701A4F764E8">6. In the religious part of your education, it is not ex|pected that you &s;hould be engaged in the profound di&s;qui&s;i|tions of theology. The plain doctrines of the religion which you have been taught to profe&s;s mu&s;t be explained to you; but the principal bu&s;ine&s;s is to open your hearts for the re|ception of tho&s;e &s;entiments and precepts, which conduce to the direction of your actions in the employments and en|gagements of your &s;ub&s;equent life.</P>
<P N="7">7. In the fir&s;t place, I mu&s;t then remind you of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of reading the Scriptures; that is, of drinking the &s;acred waters at the fountain. But to read the Scriptures to advantage, judgment is nece&s;&s;ary; and as judgment at your age is not mature, you mu&s;t &s;eek and follow the di|rections of your in&s;tructors.</P>
<P N="8">8. At your age, the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t per&s;picuous pa&s;|&s;ages will be&s;t de&s;erve and reward your attention. The hi&s;torical parts of the Old Te&s;tament will entertain you, if you con&s;ider them only in a cla&s;&s;ical view, as valuable pa&s;|&s;ages of ancient hi&s;tory; but I chiefly refer you to the books which more immediately conduce to moral in&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P N="9">9. If you read the Old Te&s;tament with a ta&s;te for its beauties, you will accompli&s;h two important purpo&s;es at the &s;ame time. You will acquire a knowledge of the Holy Bible, which is your duty; and you will improve your ta&s;te and judgment, which is your bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;tudents in the cour&s;e of a polite education.</P>
<P N="10">10. The New Te&s;tament requires the peculiar attention of every one who profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian. But here al&s;o judgment is nece&s;&s;ary to direct the &s;tudent in the mode of his &s;tudy. To one who has not the requi&s;ite &s;hare of introductory knowledge, the Go&s;pel will appear to contain many difficulties.</P>
<P N="11">11. As you cannot yet engage in theological &s;tudies, I mu&s;t recommend it to you to take up the Te&s;tament with that humility which becomes all human creatures, but more particularly per&s;ons &s;o young as you are, and &s;o de&s;|titute of all that knowledge which can enable you to form a deci&s;ive opinion in divinity.</P>
<P N="12">12. You will do right to pay particular attention to the &s;ermon on the mount, and to that admirable epitome of all
<PB N="227" REF="026674_0227_0FD1570779771EE0">
moral philo&s;ophy, the rule of doing to others as we wi&s;h them to do to us. If you pay due obedience to this pre|cept, you will never he&s;itate in determining what part you &s;hall act whenever difficulties occur.</P>
<P N="13">13. It will however be proper that you &s;hould at an early age familiarize to your mind the language of the Scriptures, in all their parts, though you &s;hould not be able fully to comprehend them. You will thus trea&s;ure up ma|ny u&s;eful pa&s;&s;ages in your memory, which, on many occa|&s;ions in the cour&s;e of your lives, may be u&s;eful.</P>
<P N="14">14. A very early acquaintance with the words of the Old and New Te&s;tament, even before any adequate ideas of their meaning have been obtained, has been found u&s;eful in &s;ub&s;equent life to the profe&s;&s;ed divine.</P>
<P N="15">15. And here I cannot but animadvert on the prevalent neglect of the Holy Scriptures; a neglect which too plain|ly indicates a faint belief in the doctrines which they con|tain, and which ought to animate every parent and in&s;truc|tor in the bu&s;ine&s;s of infu&s;ing religious &s;entiments and a rev|erence for the Scriptures, while the mind is mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of deep impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="16">16. You, who con&s;titute a part of the ri&s;ing generation, will exert your&s;elves in removing an evil which menaces the ruin of the national morals and pro&s;perity. They in|deed who are capable of a &s;entiment &s;o enlarged as this, exhibit a manline&s;s of mind, which is the more honorable to them as it is uncommon at their age.</P>
<P N="17">17. In the religious part of your education, it would be a di&s;graceful omi&s;&s;ion to neglect the catechi&s;m. I recom|mend it to you as a u&s;eful, though humble guide, and I wi&s;h to warn you again&s;t that pride of heart which induces &s;ome per&s;ons to &s;light it, and from that &s;pirit of cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s, which cau&s;es in others a di&s;like of all that contradicts their own particular per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P N="18">18. Make it a rule, never to be violated, to pray night and morning. It is indeed true that in this, and other &s;chools, it is u&s;ual to begin and end the exerci&s;es of the day with prayer; but I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that this is often con&s;idered as a mere formality. You will pay attention to this duty, and you will al&s;o repeat other prayers at ly|ing down on your pillow and ri&s;ing from it.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="228" REF="026674_0228_0FD157094C1206E0">19. You will in vain expect &s;ucce&s;s in your &s;tudies, un|le&s;s you implore a ble&s;&s;ing on them from Heaven; or if you &s;hould be permitted by Providence to make a proficien|cy in knowledge for the &s;ake of others, you will not derive from your acqui&s;ition that degree of happine&s;s which you would otherwi&s;e enjoy. You mu&s;t a&s;k the Giver of every good gift for that mo&s;t valuable gift of literary improvement.</P>
<P N="20">20. You are apt at your age to be thoughtle&s;s. You enjoy health and &s;pirits. You are &s;trangers to the cares of the world. Cheerfulne&s;s indeed becomes you; but let me prevail with you, when I entreat you to con&s;ider the value of time, and the importance of making a good u&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="21">21. Con&s;ider your parents. Form an idea of the anx|iety which they feel on your account. You mu&s;t have ob|&s;erved how eagerly they wi&s;h for your improvement. They feel a laudable ambition, which prompts them to de&s;ire that you may arrive at eminence in whatever profe&s;&s;ion or em|ployment you may hereafter be engaged by Providence.</P>
<P N="22">22. To them it would be a painful &s;ight to &s;ee you con|temptible and un&s;ucce&s;sful. But nothing can vindicate you from contempt, or en&s;ure your &s;ucce&s;s &s;o effectually as per&s;on|al merit, or the qualities of a good di&s;po&s;ition, adorned with a competent &s;hare of human learning and accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P N="23">23. Your parents do all in their power to promote your improvement; but after all, they cannot but know that it remains with your&s;elves to give efficacy and final good &s;uc|ce&s;s to their endeavors. The mind is not like a ve&s;&s;el in|to which may be poured any quantity of whatever the po&s;+&s;e&s;&s;or chu&s;es to infu&s;e. It is rather like a plant, which, by the operation of its own internal powers, imbibes the nu|triment afforded by the earth.</P>
<P N="24">24. But, not to dwell on &s;imilies, it is certain that your in&s;tructors can &s;erve you only in conjunction with your own efforts. Let me then entreat you to exert your|&s;elves, if you have any regard for your parents, who&s;e hap|pine&s;s &s;o e&s;&s;entially depends on your conduct; if you have any regard for your own honor, &s;ucce&s;s, and comfort; if you hope to be u&s;eful and re&s;pected in &s;ociety, and happy in a future &s;tate.</P>
