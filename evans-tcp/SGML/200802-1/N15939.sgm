<BIBL>PSALM cxxii. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>JERUSALEM IS BUILDED, AS A CITY THAT IS COMPACT TOGETHER.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JERUSALEM was a city, defended with &s;trong walls, the metropolis of the king|dom of I&s;rael, and the capital &s;eat of the He|brew empire.&mdash;It's inhabitants were not a loo&s;e, di&s;connected people, but mo&s;t &s;trictly united, not only among them&s;elves, but with all the tribes of I&s;rael, into a holy nation and commonwealth, under JEHOVAH their king and their God.&mdash;And as Jeru&s;alem was the place, which he was plea&s;ed to honour as the &s;eat of his royal re&s;idence and government, it was mo&s;t truly the city of the Great King. Hence both by divine appointment, and the common con&s;ent of the nation, it was e&s;tab|li&s;hed as the local centre of communion in all the privileges of their civil and &s;acred con&s;ti|tution. There were the thrones of judgement, the thrones of the hou&s;e of David, and the &s;upreme courts of ju&s;tice, and of the public
<PB N="6" REF="020393_0005_0FAF0523FAD12100">
admini&s;tration: There were the Levites, wait|ing in their cour&s;es, and the Prie&s;ts, mini&s;ter|ing in their offices, before the LORD: There was the te&s;timony, the ark of the covenant, the temple, and the &s;olemn &s;ervices of reli|gion: And there all the tribes and &s;ceptres of the people, a&s;&s;embled three times in the year, to pre&s;ent national homage to JEHOVAH, their king and their God.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e re&s;pects, whether Jeru&s;alem be con&s;idered in a natural, civil or religious view, its &s;trength and beauty con&s;i&s;ted, in being builded "as a city, that is compact togeth|er." Hence the P&s;almi&s;t's affection for Jeru|&s;alem expre&s;&s;ed in this P&s;alm was not a meer partial and local fondne&s;s; but had in view, and was excited by the mo&s;t noble objects. The&s;e were the exaltation of JEHOVAH, the king and God of Zion&mdash;the honour and hap|pine&s;s of the nation&mdash;the pre&s;ervation of the true religion, and the peace and be&s;t good of all the tribes of I&s;rael. Religion therefore, and public &s;pirit were untied in the ardent af|fection of the pious I&s;raelites, toward Jeru&s;a|lem, which they preferred above their chief joy.</P>
<P>WE have al&s;o a Jeru&s;alem, adorned with brighter glories of divine grace, and with greater beauties of holine&s;s, than were ever
<PB N="7" REF="020393_0006_0FAF0524B9A5D000">
di&s;played, in the mo&s;t augu&s;t &s;olemnities of the Hebrew-temple-wor&s;hip; and pre&s;ents, to our devout admiration, gratitude and prai&s;e, more excellent means of religion and virtue, peace and happine&s;s, than ever called the attention of the a&s;&s;embled tribes of I&s;rael. We enjoy all the privileges of a free govern|ment, the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel of peace, and the honours of the church of GOD. This is our Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>THE &s;afety and pre&s;ervation of it de|pend, under GOD, on the friendly agree|ment of its citizens in all tho&s;e things, ne|ce&s;&s;ary for its honour and defence, happine&s;s and glory. Without this agreement, it can|not be "builded as a city, that is compact together." There will be no peace within its walls, nor pro&s;perity within its palaces: It can have neither &s;trength or beauty, nor ad|mini&s;ter protection to its inhabitants; but it will be as a city broken down, and without walls.</P>
<P>THE text therefore, and the great occa&s;ion, on which we are a&s;&s;embled in the hou&s;e of GOD, ju&s;tify a di&s;cour&s;e on the great princi|ples and maxims, of civil union&mdash;the impor|tance of a good, public admini&s;tration, to an&s;wer the great ends of government&mdash;and the nece&s;&s;ity of the joint exertions of &s;ubjects, with their rulers, in promoting the public peace and happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="020393_0007_0FAF0525764EBD90">
I AM then, in the fir&s;t place, to point out &s;ome of the great principles and maxims, which are the foundation and cement of civil union and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE principles of &s;ociety are the laws, which Almighty GOD has e&s;tabli&s;hed in the moral world, and made nece&s;&s;ary to be ob|&s;erved by mankind; in order to promote their true happine&s;s, in their tran&s;actions and inter|cour&s;e. The&s;e laws may be con&s;idered as principles, in re&s;pect of their fixedne&s;s and operation; and as maxims, &s;ince by the knowledge of them, we di&s;cover tho&s;e rules of conduct, which direct mankind to the highe&s;t perfection, and &s;upreme happine&s;s of their nature. They are as fixed and un|changeable as the laws which operate in the natural world.</P>
<P>HUMAN art in order to produce certain effects, mu&s;t conform to the principles and laws, which the Almighty Creator has e&s;tab|li&s;hed in the natural world. He who neg|lects the cultivation of his field, and the proper time of &s;owing, may not expect a har|ve&s;t. He, who would a&s;&s;i&s;t mankind in rai&s;|ing weights, and overcoming ob&s;tacles, de|pends on certain rules, derived from the knowledge of mechanical principles, applied to the con&s;truction of machines, in order to
<PB N="9" REF="020393_0008_0FAF052639568EF0">
give the mo&s;t u&s;eful effect to the &s;malle&s;t force: And every builder &s;hould well un|der&s;tand the be&s;t po&s;ition of firmne&s;s and &s;trength, when he is about to erect an edifice. For he, who attempts the&s;e things, on other principles, than tho&s;e of nature, attempts to make a new world; and his aim will prove ab&s;urd and his labour lo&s;t. No more can mankind be conducted to happine&s;s; or civil &s;ocieties united, and enjoy peace and pro&s;|perity, without ob&s;erving the moral princi|ples and connections, which the &s;ame Al|mighty Creator has e&s;tabli&s;hed for the gov|ernment of the moral world.</P>
<P>MORAL connections and cau&s;es in different circum&s;tances produce harmony or di&s;cord, peace or war, happine&s;s or woe among man|kind, with the &s;ame certainty, as phy&s;ical cau&s;es produce their effect. To in&s;titute the&s;e cau&s;es and connexions belongs not to men, to nations or to human laws, but to build upon them. It is no more in the power of the greate&s;t earthly potentate to hinder their operation, than it is to govern the flow|ing and ebbing of the ocean.</P>
<P>THE great and mo&s;t univer&s;al principle and law of rational union and happine&s;s, is the love of GOD and of our neighbour: This in the moral, is like the great law of gravi|tation
<PB N="10" REF="020393_0009_0FAF05270BEAA8C0">
and attraction in the natural world; and its tendency in human &s;ociety, is to uni|ver&s;al good. The fir&s;t maxim derived from it, is that divine precept in the go&s;pel, "what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye al&s;o the &s;ame unto them." Hence religion and virtue are the great prin|ciples on which the happine&s;s of human &s;o|cieties mu&s;t be built; and from the&s;e princi|ples mu&s;t be derived the knowledge of all laws, which determine the order of that be|nevolence, we owe to one another, and point out the means of attaining the greate&s;t good.</P>
<P>IF this were a &s;tate of &s;o much innocence and perfection, that the law of rea&s;on and of love directed and influenced all the views and actions of mankind, there would be no nece&s;&s;ity for the coercion of civil government. But in the pre&s;ent depraved &s;tate of human nature, the various di&s;po&s;itions and differing pur&s;uits, the jarring intere&s;ts, and unruly pa&s;&s;|ions, the jealou&s;ies and mi&s;apprehen&s;ions of neighbours would &s;poil their harmony and good agreement; and, when di&s;putes aro&s;e, there would be no common judge, to whom they might refer their differences; but eve|ry one would be an avenger of his own wrong: This would &s;oon end in a &s;tate of hatred and war; and de&s;troy all human peace and happine&s;s. To prevent this mi&s;chief,
<PB N="11" REF="020393_0010_0FAF0527B82AFF70">
and to &s;ecure the enjoyment of rational liberty, which &s;ummarily con&s;i&s;ts in the unmole&s;ted privilege and opportunity of "leading a qui|et and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and ho|ne&s;ty," is the great end of the in&s;titution of ci|vil &s;ociety and government.</P>
<P>THE end therefore, and nature of civil gov|ernment imply that it mu&s;t have for its foun|dation, the principles and laws of truth, ju&s;|tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, mercy and the fear of GOD; or it can never advance the happine&s;s of mankind. For that mankind by uniting in|to &s;ociety, and putting them&s;elves under a com|mon government, can promote their true in|tere&s;t, otherwi&s;e than by ob&s;erving the&s;e laws, is as contrary to rea&s;on as, that a machine may be of great and beneficial u&s;e in human life, when its whole con&s;truction is contrary to all the principles, by which the world of nature is actuated and kept together.</P>
<P>THERE can be no beneficial union among the members of a community, where the&s;e great principles of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth in|tegrity and the fear of GOD, are not maintain|ed, both among them&s;elves, and towards all mankind. Any number of men, confedera|ted together in wickedne&s;s and inju&s;tice, can have no &s;trength, but what they derive from being faithful to oneanother. Such a com|bination
<PB N="12" REF="020393_0011_0FAF05289688A570">
may exi&s;t among robbers and pi|rates: but their agreement ought not to be dignified by the name of civil union: it ought rather to be e&s;teemed a wicked con&s;pi|racy again&s;t the rights of mankind, which can never be ju&s;tified by number, nor on any pretence of public good.</P>
<P>THESE moral principles and connections are moral laws, not only, as they point out a fixed order of events re&s;pecting moral ends, in which view the meer politician, who has no fear of GOD before his eyes, may con&s;ider them; but to the enlightened and religious mind, they are moral laws, in a higher &s;en&s;e&mdash;laws of our creator, for the conduct of our life and manners. They cannot therefore be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, without offending again&s;t his will and authority&mdash;without incurring guilt in his &s;ight, and rendering our&s;elves obnoxi|ous to his wrath and di&s;plea&s;ure, as the great and righteous governor of the world. <Q>The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne is in heaven; his eyes be|hold, his eye-lids try the children of men. The LORD trieth the righteous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence, his &s;oul hateth. Upon the wicked he &s;hall rain &s;nares, fire and brim&s;tone and an hor|rible tempe&s;t. This &s;hall be the portion of their cup. For the righteous LORD
<PB N="13" REF="020393_0012_0FAF05295DE14EA8">
loveth the righteous, his countenance doth behold the upright.</Q></P>
<P>IF we can find what are the laws and rules, which men, as rational creatures, mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that they may arrive at the greate&s;t happine&s;s and perfection of their nature, the&s;e are the laws which they mu&s;t ob&s;erve, when united in political bodies, in order to pro|mote the common good of &s;ociety. The &s;ame virtue and integrity, truth, ju&s;tice and honour, which, we venerate in a private cha|racter, mu&s;t be found in the public admi|ni&s;tration, and generally prevailing among a people, or a &s;tate, cannot be united, peaceful and happy in it&s;elf, and re&s;pectable in the world.</P>
<P>HENCE in all well regulated civil com|munities, laws of natural, univer&s;al and un|changeable obligation hold the fir&s;t rank: They are &s;uch fixed means of union, peace and happine&s;s, that no other can or ought to be &s;ub&s;tituted in their room. It may howe|ver be ob&s;erved, that the force of civil &s;ociety cannot extend to all laws of this kind; but only to &s;uch upon the ob&s;ervation of which the common quiet of mankind entirely de|pends. To do to our neighbour as we would that he &s;hould do to us is one of the plaine&s;t dictates of rea&s;on, and a law of uni|ver&s;al
<PB N="14" REF="020393_0013_0FAF052A543704B0">
equity and obligation. It compre|hends the whole of &s;ocial duty, and extends to kindne&s;s, humanity and mercy, as well as to truth and ju&s;tice. But although it is the great rule of our conduct and the bond of &s;o|ciety, it cannot in its whole extention have the force of a civil law in commonwealths. Controver&s;ies about the violation of it would be perplexed and intricate: Litigious &s;uits would be infinitely multiplied: The good and virtuous would be deprived of the mo&s;t valuable part of their character: and the &s;tate would be torn with inte&s;tine divi&s;ion and di&s;cord.</P>
<P>BUT, tho' all the laws of nature cannot be enforced with civil &s;anctions, yet every righte|ous &s;tate adopts tho&s;e, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the public peace, and for an equal and impartial di&s;tribution of rewards and puni&s;hments. The good and virtuous, who are influenced to do well out of rever|ence to GOD, and &s;incere love to mankind, mu&s;t be protected and encouraged; and the wicked and di&s;orderly, re&s;trained by the dread of puni&s;hment. The great laws of ju&s;tice mu&s;t be armed with a civil force, and never allowed to be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed with impunity. Such, for in&s;tance, is that &s;tatute of JEHO|VAH, the GOD and King of I&s;rael, <Q>Ye &s;hall do no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; in judgement,
<PB N="15" REF="020393_0014_0FAF052AD6877C90">
in mete-yard, in weight or in mea&s;ure. Ju&s;t balances, ju&s;t weights, a ju&s;t ephah, and a ju&s;t hin, &s;hall ye have.</Q> This law mu&s;t be admitted into every civil &s;tate; but, that it may have force in &s;ociety, the public &s;tandard mu&s;t be fixed; the mo&s;t convenient weights and mea&s;ures, determined; the man|ner of their being tried, a&s;certained; and an awful penalty annexed to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. The&s;e are circum&s;tances, which are not de|termined by the law of nature; but mu&s;t be adju&s;ted by civil regulations &s;uited to the condition of particular commonwealths.</P>
<P>THE principles and laws of ju&s;tice are fix|ed and unchangeable&mdash;they depend not on human authority; but the particular regula|tions, by which they have force in &s;ociety, as civil laws, not being determined by the law of nature, may be changed, when they are found inconvenient and hurtful to the community. Hence the legi&s;lative authority of a &s;tate, extends to the repealing of old, as well as the making of new laws.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, great care &s;hould be tak|en in framing laws, that they may be &s;uited to the peculiar &s;tate of a people, and have an equal and uniform operation for the public good. New and different circum&s;tances re|quire new and different regulations in &s;ocie|ty
<PB N="16" REF="020393_0015_0FAF052E08DCF778">
fitted to the occa&s;ions which produce them: But the fundamental laws, by which a peo|ple are compacted together, like the laws of the natural world, mu&s;t have a fixed con&s;i&s;t|ence and duration. Such, in general, are laws relating to per&s;onal liberty, the privileges of the &s;ubject, and the powers of the magi&s;|trate&mdash;to private property and the execution of ju&s;tice&mdash;to the puni&s;hment of evil-doers and the pre&s;ervation of the public peace&mdash;to marriage, education, religion, and the rights of con&s;cience&mdash;to the public forms, and or|der of government&mdash;and to the revenues and taxes, by which the &s;tate is supported. Fre|quent changes even in the external appen|dages, much more an unfixedne&s;s in the laws, and a want of &s;tability in the public admini&s;|tration, dimini&s;h the energy and dignity of government, and will be attended with unea|&s;ine&s;s and di&s;cord.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add, that as the be&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful laws can be of no u&s;e, unle&s;s &s;ub|jects be trained up and educated in a manner of living conformable to them, every wi&s;e &s;tate will pay great attention to the education of children, and to all &s;uch regulations, as are nece&s;&s;ary for the in&s;truction of the peo|ple in the principles of piety and virtue. The be&s;t &s;ecurity men can have, of living to|gether in harmony and love, is from the
<PB N="17" REF="020393_0016_0FAF05302AE2C280">
prevalence of true religion, and a due regard to the will and authority of the &s;upreme be|ing. Religion and virtue, are the &s;tronge&s;t bond of human &s;ociety, and lay the be&s;t foun|dation of peace and happine&s;s in the civil &s;tate.</P>
<P>I PROCEED, in the next place, to con&s;ider the importance of a good public-admini&s;|tration of government, to the peace and hap|pine&s;s of a people.</P>
<P>ALL the qualifications of a good admini&s;|tration may be &s;ummed up in two heads, the ability and faithfulne&s;s of tho&s;e, who are in|tru&s;ted with the weighty concerns of the &s;tate: To one or the other of the&s;e two things may be referred, whatever can be de&s;ired or ex|pected in a good ruler. The&s;e qualifications are of the highe&s;t importance, in every ad|mini&s;tration. A free people, under GOD, may ju&s;tly put confidence in &s;uch an admi|ni&s;tration, and not find them&s;elves di&s;ap|pointed, as they mu&s;t unavoidably be if they commit them&s;elves into the hands of weak or wicked men&punc; The former, though they mean never &s;o well, are unable to do good; the latter may improve their great talents, to do mi&s;chief: Neither of them are fit to be intru&s;ted with the great affairs of &s;tate. Who, on the one hand, would willingly tru&s;t his
<PB N="18" REF="020393_0017_0FAF0530D271A630">
whole intere&s;t to the power and di&s;po&s;al of a man of the greate&s;t abilities, but de&s;titute of honour and con&s;cience; or on the other hand, who would undertake a dangerous voyage, on the boi&s;terous ocean, under the command of the mo&s;t upright and hone&s;t man, who had no knowledge of the art of na|vigation, nor any acquaintance with the &s;eas. In common affairs no hone&s;t man will under|take any bu&s;ine&s;s for which he knows he is unfit, though he &s;hould be &s;olicited to do it: The &s;ame &s;hould be ob&s;erved by men, invit|ed to &s;erve the public. When a people have rai&s;ed men of weak abilities to po&s;ts of hon|our, it may &s;eem hard to neglect them; and it mu&s;t, indeed, be ungrateful, if in any good degree, they maintain the dignity of their &s;tations, and advance the public good; and e&s;pecially, if the po&s;ts they hold, were un|&s;ought, and conferred without &s;olicitation. Neverthele&s;s it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that tho&s;e, who undertake the affairs of the pub|lic, are as an&s;werable for their abilities, as the &s;oldier for his courage, when he inli&s;ts into the &s;ervice of his country. The &s;afety of the public is to be preferred to the honour of an individual.</P>
<P>HERE I might delineate more fully the character of an able and faithful admini&s;tra|tion; but I will not enlarge, and &s;hall &s;ay
<PB N="19" REF="020393_0018_0FAF05319ECC4700">
only in a few words, that the principal lines of it, are knowledge, wi&s;dom, and pru|dence, courage and un&s;haken re&s;olution, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and ju&s;tice, tempered with lenity, mercy, and compa&s;&s;ion, and a &s;teady firmne&s;s of public mea&s;ures, when founded in wi&s;dom and the public good, together with inflexible integrity, the fear of GOD, and a &s;acred re|gard to the moral and religious intere&s;ts of the community. The&s;e are the great cha|racteri&s;tics of an admini&s;tration, which will procure re&s;pect and confidence; and has the be&s;t tendency to promote the happine&s;s, u|nion and &s;trength of a people, and to render them as a "city, that is compact together."</P>
<P>IF a virtuous people venerate rulers of this character, and unite their endeavours with them in advancing all the noble ends of &s;o|ciety, they will have the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of peace and pro&s;perity; which was the la&s;t thing, I propo&s;ed to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>LET the fir&s;t object, exciting the attention of a free people, be the character of tho&s;e, whom they introduce into public offices; and, the next, that they reverence the worthy magi&s;trate, &s;upport him in his office and dig|nity, and &s;hew a ready obedience to the laws of the &s;tate.</P>

NOT only may a people be delivered into the hands of tyrants, as the rod and &s;courge of heaven for their impiety and madne&s;s; but through their own folly, "children may be their princes, and babes rule over them."

<P>HOW idle are all di&s;putes about a technical ari&s;tocracy, if people di&s;regard that divine injunction, given by Mo&s;es, to the free elec|tors of I&s;rael, when he was about to appoint &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tants in government. <Q>Take ye

<P>SUCH an ari&s;tocracy is founded in merit and de&s;igned by the GOD of government and order to direct a free people in the choice of their judges and public magi&s;trates. Riches are &s;o far nece&s;&s;ary as to rai&s;e the judge and coun&s;ellor above the temptation of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing for a peace of bread, neverthele&s;s this ari&s;tocracy is derived from merit and that influence, which a character for &s;uperiour wi&s;|dom, and known &s;ervices to the common|wealth, has to produce veneration, confidence and e&s;teem, among a people, who have felt the benefits, and enjoy the advantage of be|ing under &s;o happy a direction.</P>
<P>THIS influence of character in the lan|guage of the Roman republic, was called <HI>Auctoritas patrum,</HI> and the veneration paid to it by the people, <HI>Verecundia plebis.</HI> It is e&s;|&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in all good governments, but e&s;pecially the life and &s;pirit of a happy, free and republican &s;tate, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts on the virtues of its citizens, and can never, while any found wi&s;dom is left to direct the public choice, by de&s;ign commit the civil ad|mini&s;tration into the hands of men de&s;titute of
<PB N="22" REF="020393_0021_0FAF0533C43A8118">
political abilities, or who are the patrons of vice.</P>
<P>IT is therefore, of the highe&s;t importance to the being, happine&s;s and peace of free re|publics, to &s;hew a fixed and unalterable re|gard to merit in the choice of their rulers: The next thing is to di&s;cover a deference and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to authority, obedience to the laws, a &s;pirit of righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and a di&s;|po&s;ition to promote the public good.</P>
<P>HONOUR and re&s;pect are due to rulers: The order and good of &s;ociety require exter|nal marks of di&s;tinction, and titles of emi|nence to be given them. This is due to their office; an honour paid to the in&s;titution of government; but there is a further honour due to them, when they are faithful in exe|cuting the tru&s;t committed to them, and di|rect all their actions to advance the true in|tere&s;t of the &s;tate. In this view, good rulers alone can be honoured, becau&s;e they alone de&s;erve e&s;teem and re&s;pect. We owe obedi|ence and &s;ubjection to all rulers in the execu|tion of their office, according to the laws of the land; but, as to cordial affection, vene|ration, e&s;teem and gratitude, the&s;e are due only to the worthy magi&s;trate; and the debt will be paid by all virtuous citizens, although he &s;hould be bla&s;phemed, arraigned, and con|demned
<PB N="23" REF="020393_0022_0FAF053498CCA200">
by the factious and di&s;contented, who wi&s;h that there &s;hould be no righteous government in the world.</P>
<P>IF we wilfully tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of &s;ocie|ty and re&s;i&s;t the ju&s;t commands of civil au|thority, we do an injury not &s;o much to the magi&s;trate, as to the community, and expo&s;e our&s;elves to the high di&s;plea&s;ure of Almighty GOD, who&s;e authority is above all human con|&s;titutions, and can never be annulled by the decrees of kings and nobles, the con&s;ults of &s;enates, or the joint con&s;ent of a people.</P>
<P>THIS is the &s;entiment of a great and good man, who well knew the rights of human nature, and the privileges of a &s;ubject, which he had the courage to plead before kings and magi&s;trates; I mean the apo&s;tle Paul, who, illuminated with the knowledge of chri&s;tian|ity, and in&s;pired with the benevolence of the go&s;pel, the &s;lave of no party, in the greate&s;t tran&s;ports of zeal, &s;poke only the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s. The doctrine he deliv|ered was not the effect of &s;ervile flattery and &s;hameful cowardice: It proceeded not from the &s;pirit of fear, but of love and a &s;ound mind: It is &s;o expre&s;&s;ed as at once to de|clare the great end of civil government, the duty of the magi&s;trate, and the rea&s;on|ablene&s;s of the &s;ubjects obedience. It con|tains

WHEN a con&s;titutional government is con|verted into tyranny, and the laws, rights and properties of a free people are openly invad|ed, there ought not to be the lea&s;t doubt but that a remedy con&s;i&s;tent with this doctrine of the apo&s;tle, is provided in the laws of GOD and rea&s;on, for their pre&s;ervation; nor ought re&s;i&s;tance in &s;uch ca&s;e to be called rebellion.

<P>CIVIL &s;ociety can exi&s;t no longer, than while connected by its laws and con&s;titution: The&s;e are of no force, otherwi&s;e than as they are maintained and defended by the members of the commonwealth. This regular &s;upport of authority is the only &s;ecurity, a people can have again&s;t violence and inju&s;tice, feuds and animo&s;ities, in the unmole&s;ted enjoyment of their hone&s;t acqui&s;itions: Hence the very end of civil &s;ociety demands, that the orders of government b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> enforced; the fountains of ju&s;tice, kept open; the &s;treams, pre&s;erved pure; and the &s;tate, defended again&s;t all in|ternal and foreign violence.

never be attained, under the mo&s;t excellent con&s;titution and laws, but by means of an a|ble and faithful admini&s;tration, and the con|curring zeal and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all good and virtuous citizens.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH &s;ome exclude religion and the profe&s;&s;ion and wor&s;hip of the go&s;pel from having any concern in the happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety and in the choice of rulers among a free people, yet without religion, a people hap|pily united in all other re&s;pects, want the bond, mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the union, and to excite every one to faithful|ne&s;s in his &s;tation.</P>
<P>THE chief glory of the go&s;pel is, that it o|pens the way of &s;alvation to a fallen world, and contains the words of eternal life: And were not this its great and di&s;tingui&s;hing ex|cellence, it would be of &s;o much le&s;s import|ance to mankind, as the concerns of eternity are greater than tho&s;e of time. It does every thing for our happine&s;s in this world, which can be effected by the mo&s;t excellent pre|cepts of morality, and by in&s;tructing us in all the duties, we owe to GOD, our neigh|bour and our&s;elves: At the &s;ame time, it binds us to the mo&s;t unremitting diligence and per&s;everance in all good works, by the &s;olemn account we mu&s;t give to our righteous judge, for all the deeds done in the body.</P>

THE ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel is therefore the be&s;t privilege which a people can enjoy; and were its precepts duly ob&s;erved, the civil &s;tate would be in the be&s;t order, and in the mo&s;t excellent condition. Per&s;ons of all ranks, according to their abilities, would be ble&s;&s;ings to the community. The foundations of our Jeru&s;alem would be laid with poli&s;hed &s;tones, and the city of our habitation be built up without the noi&s;e of &s;aws and hammers. The &s;tone would not cry out of the wall of public fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion, nor the beam out of the timber an&s;wer it; but our officers would be peace, and our exactors righteou&s;ne&s;s; our walls would be called &s;alvation and our gates prai&s;e, and no wa&s;ting violence and de&s;truc|tion would be heard in our borders.</P>
<P>HAVING pointed out the principles and maxims, on which civil union and happine&s;s depend, and con&s;idered both the character of a good admini&s;tration of government, and what is required of the &s;ubjects and citizens of a free &s;tate, I proceed to addre&s;s and exhort the &s;everal orders of men pre&s;ent, that in their &s;everal places they u&s;e their be&s;t and mo&s;t faithful endeavours for promoting the public peace and pro&s;perity, that this and the United States, may, after the model of Jeru&s;alem, be "builded, as a city that is compact to|gether."</P>

<P>HEAR all the equitable petitions of the people; but &s;hould they a&s;k you to be un|righteous, &s;top your ears: Be merciful and compa&s;&s;ionate; but maintain a conduct con|&s;i&s;tent with the dignity, faith and honour of government, and with tho&s;e fixed rules and everla&s;ting maxims, by which it is to be ad|mini&s;tered.

<P>I SHALL add only in a few words, that while in all other ways, you endeavour the good of this people, and expect from them a reverential regard for magi&s;tracy, and a peaceable behaviour in the &s;tate, you will, Gentlemen, appoint men of virtue and religi|on

<P><PB N="46" REF="020393_0045_0FAF054CBA7F8660">
MY FATHERS AND BRETHREN,</P>
<P>WE are members of civil &s;ociety, equally intere&s;ted in it's peace and pro&s;perity, with the re&s;t of our fellow-citizens; and e&s;pecially "becau&s;e of the hou&s;e of the LORD our GOD," we are bound "to &s;eek" it's "good." The immediate ends of the magi&s;tracy and mini&s;t|ry are different, but not oppo&s;ite: They mu|tually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, and ultimately center in the &s;ame point. The one has for its ob|ject the promotion of religion and the cau&s;e of CHRIST; the other immediately aims at the peace and order of mankind in this world: Without which, there could be no fixed means of religion; nor the church have a continuance on earth, but through the inter|po&s;ition of a miraculous providence, con|&s;tantly di&s;played for its pre&s;ervation. Hence the church of CHRIST will have no fixed re|&s;idence, where there is no civil government, until he, who&s;e right it is, &s;hall take to him|&s;elf his great power, and reign King of na|tions, even as he is King of &s;aints.</P>
<P>How thankful then &s;hould we be for the ordinance of civil government, which is a token of divine forbearance to a guilty world; and will continue till the de&s;igns of the chri&s;|tian mini&s;try, are accompli&s;hed. How many have no higher conception of the chri&s;tian
<PB N="47" REF="020393_0046_0FAF054D36AAB488">
mini&s;try, and the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD in appointing it, than as relating to this world? Hence, while they pride them&s;elves in civil privileges, and perhaps, allow the morality of the go&s;pel to have &s;ome good in|fluence on the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, they have no idea of the glory of the chri&s;tian &s;cheme of &s;alvation, and de&s;pi&s;e the go&s;pel, the mi|ni&s;try and the church of GOD. And yet, were it not, that the go&s;pel might be preach|ed, and the church have a being on earth, civil government would cea&s;e among men.</P>
<P>To preach the go&s;pel of the Redeemer, to open his &s;alvation, to explain and urge his precepts, and to repre&s;ent the motives of the religion taught by him, together with the ad|mini&s;tration of the ordinances, which he hath appointed, are the immediate end; and the peculiar work of the chri&s;tian mini&s;try. This is the part, my Fathers and Brethren, a&s;&s;ign|ed to us, on the walls of our Jeru&s;alem; and whoever is faithful in this divine employ|ment, will at once advance the temporal and eternal intere&s;ts of mankind.</P>
<P>To this work, therefore, let us attend with all diligence and faithfulne&s;s, and u&s;e our ut|mo&s;t endeavours to promote the de&s;igns of redeeming love; in recovering &s;inful, guilty and mi&s;erable men, to the image and favour
<PB N="48" REF="020393_0047_0FAF054DF5AF2230">
of GOD, in bringing them to a life of holi|ne&s;s, and to the practice of all righteou&s;ne&s;s and virtue. In doing this, we &s;hall be the happy in&s;truments of advancing the be&s;t good of &s;ociety, by leading them to the dili|gent practice of all the duties of the &s;ocial and chri&s;tian life; and render them, mo&s;t u&s;eful in their re&s;pective places: But, more e&s;pecially, we &s;hall be happy, in being made in&s;truments, under the &s;acred influence of our divine LORD, of plucking them from the jaws of de&s;truction, and the power and tyran|ny of Satan, of rai&s;ing them to the greate&s;t dignity and perfection of their nature, and of preparing them for the new Jeru&s;alem, the city of our GOD, "wherein dwelleth righte|ou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>WHILE we look to our civil fathers for their kind countenance and protection, it will be our con&s;tant care to &s;trengthen and encourage them, in the great and weighty concerns of government, by our prayers, by our public in&s;tructions, and by our examples, not only of civil &s;ubjection and obedience, but of all virtues, which adorn the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion and mini&s;try, and conduce to the peace and pro&s;perity of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>IN this let us &s;trive to excel, and unite all our endeavours. What is more nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="49" REF="020393_0048_0FAF054ECA8C2648">
than union among the mini&s;ters of CHRIST? What gives the enemies of religion more ad|vantage, than the di&s;cord, which has prevail|ed among chri&s;tians? Or what &s;tabs the cau&s;e of the Redeemer, with deeper wounds, than the contention of his mini&s;ters? Let us not look to the coercive power of the civil &s;word, to heal the&s;e wounds; but to our di|vine and almighty Saviour, to give us one heart and one way; and let us &s;tudy his go&s;|pel, which contains not only the doctrines we are to teach, and the duties we are to in|culcate; but the mo&s;t forcible motives of mutual love, kindne&s;s and forbearance. If we drink at this pure fountain of benevo|lence, and imbibe the &s;pirit of the meek and lowly JESUS, it will clean&s;e away our envy, pride and ambition, the great &s;ources of min|i&s;terial contention. We &s;hall love one an|other, and &s;trive together in our endeavours, and in our prayers for the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;|pel, and the peace of churches.</P>
<P>BRETHREN, our time is &s;hort: Our fathers many of them are gone: Every year makes breaches upon our order. May GOD &s;ancti|fy the heavy &s;trokes of the year pa&s;t, upon the churches, and the mini&s;try that we may be quickened to greater zeal and diligence in our important work.

<P>AN Addre&s;s to the numerous audience pre|&s;ent, on this joyful occa&s;ion, &s;hall conclude my di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</P>
<P>A CONSTITUTION of Government, which gives a people the liberty of choo&s;ing their own rulers, and of being governed by laws, e&s;tabli&s;hed by common con&s;ent, while they make a wi&s;e u&s;e of it, is a privilege more va|luable, than the gold of Ophir, and of great|er importance to public happine&s;s, than the rich mountains of Peru. What &s;hall you do to render this privilege, a ble&s;&s;ing to the pre|&s;ent age, and hand down the joys of it to fu|ture generations? Make it your con&s;tant aim to choo&s;e able and faithful men, who fear GOD and hate covetou&s;ne&s;s, to be your rul|ers; honour and encourage them in all their endeavours to make you a virtuous, pro&s;per|ous and happy people, and apply your&s;elves with diligence to your own bu&s;ine&s;s, that in your &s;everal &s;tations, you may contribute to the public good.</P>
<P>THE burden of government at all times, and e&s;pecially at the pre&s;ent, is very great:
<PB N="51" REF="020393_0050_0FAF05506E561F20">
We may &s;o behave as to render it, far great|er and more difficult, by our mi&s;conduct and di&s;orderly practices; and prevent the be&s;t fruits of the mo&s;t wi&s;e and righteous admini&s;|tration. We may di&s;courage the hearts and &s;lacken the hands of the mo&s;t worthy magi&s;|trates, by an unruly and di&s;contented &s;pirit, and by an oppo&s;ition to all their de&s;igns for the public good. How many endeavour to enervate and avoid the force of the mo&s;t whole&s;ome laws of &s;ociety; and u&s;e every art to make the people di&s;contented, and to pro|mote factions in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I THINK it my duty on this &s;olemn occa|&s;ion, to warn my fellow citizens, again&s;t all &s;uch vile and wicked practices, which tend to the ruin of magi&s;tracy, and the de&s;truction of peace and order. I wi&s;h, my Fellow-Citi|zens, all had a due &s;en&s;e of the high importance of civil government, and the protection af|forded us by the laws of our country. What|ever &s;ecurity and peace, we enjoy by day or night, at home or abroad, in the hou&s;e, in the field, or by the way, are by means of ci|vil union and &s;ociety. Without this bond, and the re&s;traint of civil in&s;titutions, no one would be &s;afe in his per&s;on or property. The weak would be continually expo&s;ed to the oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice of a more pow|erful neighbour. Civil government there|fore,
<PB N="52" REF="020393_0051_0FAF05512036A4A0">
well con&s;tituted, and impartially admi|ni&s;tered, is one of the mo&s;t important ble&s;&s;|ings, a gracious GOD has be&s;towed upon a guilty world; and the laws and con&s;titution of our country are our be&s;t inheritance, which we &s;hould defend at the hazard of our lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>IF any real or &s;uppo&s;ed grievances &s;hould ari&s;e in a republic, they may be examined and redre&s;&s;ed, without having recour&s;e to arms, and oppo&s;ing the government of the people, in the hands of the con&s;titutional authority of the &s;tate. Good rulers will e&s;teem it, an ho|nour that the public conduct &s;hould be ex|amined, and the errors of admini&s;tration rec|tified: And if rulers appointed by the people abu&s;e their authority, they may be di&s;placed. A republic has the means of redre&s;s within it|&s;elf; and cannot be oppre&s;&s;ed, but by its own fault and neglect.</P>
<P>BUT while in a free government, the public conduct is open to in&s;pection and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, there is a great difference between the reproof of friend&s;hip, and the reproach of an enemy; much more between per&s;onal &s;lander and a|bu&s;e, and a candid examination of public mi&s;takes and grievances, that they may be rectified and redre&s;&s;ed. The latter is the right of the people and may be encouraged;
<PB N="53" REF="020393_0052_0FAF055514773648">
the former is to be dete&s;ted, nor can its venom be hidden, or ju&s;tified, under the cloak of public good. Its tendency is to introduce an imbittered party-&s;pirit, and to promote factions and di&s;turbances: It &s;avours, not of that wi&s;dom from above, pure, peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocri&s;y, but of that which is earthly, &s;en|&s;ual, devli&s;h: It is not a cement, having the lea&s;t tendency to add &s;trength to the founda|tions, beauty to the walls, or peace and pro&s;|perity to the palaces of our Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>I SINCERELY condole with my country, under the heavy burden lying on the people. If a con&s;iderable part of this burden has been brought upon our&s;elves by imprudent con|duct, we ought not to complain to our rulers, and think our&s;elves hardly u&s;ed, if the foun|dations of ju&s;tice be not removed for our &s;akes. If any part of it be occa&s;ioned by un|nece&s;&s;ary expences in government, and by &s;a|laries and rewards, too lavi&s;hly be&s;towed on tho&s;e, who &s;erve the public, we have right to complain, and to expect redre&s;s. And if the claims of any men on the public, or other burdens in the &s;tate, be unju&s;t, we may bold|ly apply to our rulers for relief: For to exe|cute judgement, to do ju&s;tice, to loo&s;e the bands of wickedne&s;s, to undo the heavy bur|dens,

to let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free, and to break every yoke, is the great end of their in&s;titution and office: Surely then, a righte|ous Legi&s;lature will hear all our rea&s;onable complaints, and ea&s;e our &s;orrows.</P>
<P>BUT if the&s;e burdens are ju&s;t, the price of our liberty, and of all the privileges which we enjoy, what can our rulers do, but encourage us to be a righteous and indu&s;trious people, and contrive the be&s;t, mo&s;t ea&s;y and effectual mea&s;ures for di&s;charging the public debt?&mdash;They cannot deny that we have had an ar|my&mdash;hired &s;oldiers, and carried on a long and expen&s;ive war, in which through the &s;ignal interpo&s;ition of a wonder-working Providence, we have been gloriou&s;ly &s;uc|ce&s;sful&mdash;that we are indebted to France, Holland and Spain, in &s;ums to a large amount&mdash;and that thou&s;ands of our citi|zens have lent their &s;ub&s;tance and trea&s;ure to this and the United States; many of whom are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the public failure.&mdash;They cannot create &s;ilver and gold: But &s;uppo&s;|ing, it were in their power to furni&s;h a full and rich &s;tore of the&s;e articles, for which we might &s;ell and mortgage our e&s;tates, would not this be the ruin of the greater part of the debtors in the &s;tate, and of many other citizens, now in flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances?&mdash;But, it will be &s;aid, they can emit a bank of
<PB N="55" REF="020393_0054_0FAF0556F6CECEB8">
paper money, the benefit of which was ex|perienced in former times. A mighty bene|fit; a ble&s;&s;ed privilege, indeed, if it be on &s;uch a &s;inking foundation, that the di&s;hone&s;t taking advantage of its depreciation may de|fraud their creditors, and live and riot on the &s;implicity of their neighbours, and the &s;poils of public faith. Would it be right, my Fel|low-Citizens, to force &s;uch a medium into the hands of the people, again&s;t their will and con&s;ent? A tyrant may compel his va&s;&s;als for gold or &s;ilver promi&s;ed, to take lead, tin, wood or &s;tubble: But this would be e&s;teem|ed in an ea&s;tern de&s;pot no better, than open and bare faced robbery. Such a thought ought not to be entertained of the righteous Legi&s;lature of a free people, who enjoy the bible, in which we are taught, that whoever expects to be an inhabitant of the heavenly Jeru&s;alem, though he &s;ware to his hurt, changeth not. If this bank of paper-money be on a &s;ure foundation, and have a currency, equal to gold and &s;ilver, the que&s;tion re|turns, how &s;hall we obtain it, unle&s;s we earn it, or pledge our e&s;tates for the redemption of it? In the fir&s;t method, we might as well ob|tain &s;ilver and gold; the latter is big with ruin to thou&s;ands, and would tend to di&s;courage the frugality, indu&s;try and economy, which be|gin to have &s;o promi&s;ing an appearance; and

mu&s;t be the means of freeing us from the great embarra&s;&s;ments we are under.</P>
<P>A SUDDEN plenty of money, would not help us; nay it would do us hurt, unle&s;s it were obtained in that way, which would en|courage tho&s;e virtues in &s;ociety, which are the &s;trength, the happine&s;s, and beauty of a people. The&s;e are indu&s;try, hone&s;ty, frugal|ity, and the reciprocal acts of friend&s;hip, kindne&s;s, and mercy, which ari&s;e from the dependencies of one upon another. Had we a thou&s;and tons of &s;ilver di&s;per&s;ed in this &s;tate, in &s;uch manner as &s;hould check the growth of tho&s;e virtues, it would be truly the root of all evil, and di&s;po&s;e us to &s;uch a conduct, that in a few years, this mighty &s;um would vani&s;h and the people become reduced to a more wretched &s;tate of indigence and want, than before: The years of plenty would &s;oon be over, and there ari&s;e a louder cry for the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of public and private ju&s;tice, than has ever been heard in America.</P>
<P>I CANNOT my Fellow-Citizens but flatter my&s;elf, that the nece&s;&s;ity of the times has be|gun to work for its own relief, in a way con|ducive to the public good, and the virtue and peace of the people. Agriculture is more encouraged and attended to&mdash;the herds and flocks of large and &s;mall cattle are in|crea&s;ing

crea&s;ing&mdash;wool and flax are more prized&mdash;home-manufactures begin to be thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary&mdash;the di&s;taff, the wheel and loom are becoming more fa&s;hionable&mdash;the &s;hops of trifling baubles and gewgaws are le&s;s croud|ed&mdash;&s;uits at law dimini&s;hed&mdash;a general &s;pirit of indu&s;try is more prevalent, and patience and per&s;everance &s;eem only nece&s;&s;ary to crown the work.</P>
<P>BUT to clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e and addre&s;s; let us my Friends and Fellow-Citizens, faith|fully attend to our true intere&s;t and &s;afety, in all tho&s;e ways which are pointed out in wi&s;|dom and the circum&s;tances we are under&punc; Encourage your rulers in building up our Je|ru&s;alem, on the &s;trong foundations of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;maintain in your hearts and conduct, tho&s;e principles and maxims of love, benevolence and goodne&s;s, which will render you a united, happy and pro&s;perous people. Let GOD be honoured, and the grace of the Redeemer exalted; the &s;abbath &s;anctified; the wor&s;hip and ordinances of the LORD'S hou&s;e, maintained: The pious and virtuous education of the ri&s;ing generation, religiou&s;ly regarded; and a firm and inviolable adhe|rence to the laws and in&s;titutions of CHRIST, manife&s;ted by all orders and ranks of men.

<P>THIS is that peaceful and happy &s;tate, which King David &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired might be the portion of Jeru&s;alem, and make it a joy and a prai&s;e in all the earth. Let his ho|ly and pious wi&s;h be the language of all our hearts: Pray for the peace of our Je|ru&s;alem: They &s;hall pro&s;per that love thee: Peace be within thy walls, and pro&s;|perity within thy palaces: For my breth|ren and companions &s;ake, I will now &s;ay, peace be within thee; becau&s;e of the hou&s;e of the LORD our GOD, I will &s;eek thy Good.</P>
