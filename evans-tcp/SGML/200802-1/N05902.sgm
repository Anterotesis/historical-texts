<P>I AM pretty certain I need not inform my hearers, what is the more particular and &s;pecial occa&s;ion of my chu&s;ing this pa&s;&s;age of holy Scripture for the &s;ubject of our meditations at this time. So alarming a vi&s;itation of providence, does, I think, na|turally lead to it, and now claim our particular notice; and the rather, becau&s;e it has been repeated, even &s;o lately as the la&s;t evening. Tho' there are many per|&s;ons

thro'out the world, &s;o thoughtle&s;s and irreligious as to di&s;regard the common, ordinary occurrences of divine providence, which are familiar to them; yet there are few, if any, who are arrived at &s;uch a pitch of impiety, who&s;e con&s;ciences are &s;o feared and har|dened, as not to have their attention awak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned, and to receive &s;ome religious impre&s;&s;ions, by mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of &s;uch unu&s;ual, &s;uch &s;triking and &s;tupendous events. When God "looketh on the earth, and it trembleth," or "toucheth the hills, and they &s;moke," <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 104.32.

<P>SUCH &s;ea&s;ons and opportunities as the pre&s;ent, when the ears and hearts of men may be &s;uppo&s;ed more open to di&s;cipline, ought not, therefore, to be neglected, but carefully improved by tho&s;e, who&s;e particular bu&s;ine&s;s it is to "call &s;inners to repentance," and to preach righteou&s;ne&s;s to the world.

I believe there is no wicked man among&s;t us, tho' it may be ju&s;tly feared there are many to whom this character belongs; I believe there is no wicked man among&s;t us, I &s;ay, who&s;e heart did not tremble within his brea&s;t, when the earth &s;o lately trembled under his feet; none, the joynts of who&s;e loins were not loo&s;ed, and who&s;e bones and marrow did not &s;eem to be di&s;&s;olving, when the very frame of nature, and the foundations of the world were put out of cour&s;e; and all the&s;e things &s;eemed to be di&s;&s;olving. For the truth of this, I dare appeal to the mo&s;t profligate, hardened &s;inner pre&s;ent; even to tho&s;e, who may have only made a mock of &s;in be|fore, not having con&s;idered, that with God there is terrible maje&s;ty, till He thus cau&s;ed his dread to fall upon them, and his excellency made them afraid.</P>
<P>MY de&s;ign, therefore, is, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ble&s;|&s;ing of Him, <Q>who worketh all things according to the coun&s;el of his own will,</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. i.11.</NOTE> in the kingdom of his providence, and of his grace, to fix, confirm, and cultivate into a principle of &s;ober, practical religion and piety, tho&s;e good impre&s;&s;ions, which, I cannot but hope and believe, have been made upon the hearts of the young and tho'tle&s;s; and even upon tho&s;e of the

mo&s;t profane and di&s;&s;olute, by this awakening and repeat|ed vi&s;itation of divine providence: Improving it, at the &s;ame time, for the quickening of good men in their chri&s;tian cour&s;e, and "the perfecting of the &s;aints"; that they may give the more diligence to be found of their Judge in peace at la&s;t, <Q>without &s;pot and blame|le&s;s.</Q> For we are, I think, naturally led by the&s;e vi&s;itations and admonitions of providence, to turn our attention to that great period, when we &s;hall <Q>all ap|pear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t;</Q> and when all the&s;e things which were, ju&s;t now, only &s;haken, &s;hall be intirely di&s;&s;olved; and when, not only the earth &s;hall be moved out of her place, but the heavens them&s;elves "&s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e." <Q>Seeing then that all the&s;e things &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, what manner of per&s;ons ought ye to be in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s, looking for, and ha&s;ting unto, the coming of the day of GOD?</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing upon this &s;ubject, it will be proper to inquire, in the</P>
<P>FIRST place, what things tho&s;e are, of which St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;peaks; and all which, he a&s;&s;ures us, &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved?</P>
<P>SECONDLY, what we are to under&s;tand by the di&s;&s;olution of the&s;e things? And,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, when this great and intere&s;ting event &s;hall come to pa&s;s? or what will be the forerunners, concomitants, and con&s;equents of it?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="007487_0007_102b848b1f792100">FOURTHLY, I &s;hall, in conformity to the ori|ginal de&s;ign of the pa&s;&s;age, and the manife&s;t &s;cope of the apo&s;tle, urge the certainty hereof as a motive to univer&s;al holine&s;s, and, thereby, to prepare for, and ha|&s;ten unto, the coming of this Day of God.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject will then be clo&s;ed with &s;ome appli|cation of it, relative to the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, and to tho&s;e providential di&s;pen&s;ations, which &s;o naturally lead us forward in our contemplations to the great cata&s;trophe of nature, when <Q>all the&s;e things &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved.</Q> Nor can I doubt but that you will favour me with a &s;erious attention, both the &s;ubject and the occa&s;ion being &s;uch, as may ju&s;tly claim one.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it is not my intention to addre&s;s my|&s;elf merely to the pa&s;&s;ions of my hearers; much le&s;s, to take this opportunity, when the minds of many peo|ple may be ruffled and di&s;compo&s;ed, to promote the cau&s;e of &s;uper&s;tition; a cau&s;e which, I ble&s;s God, I have neither any intere&s;t nor inclination to &s;erve. I &s;hall, therefore addre&s;s my&s;elf to you, as to men, and rea&s;onable creatures; endeavouring to gain acce&s;s to your hearts and con&s;ciences, to the mo&s;t &s;ecret apart|ments of your &s;ouls, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, thro' the door of your under&s;tandings. And this will &s;o much the rather be the manner of my ad|dre&s;s, becau&s;e I am per&s;waded from my own ob&s;er|vation, that no religious impre&s;&s;ions can be of the right kind, durable, and of la&s;ting benefit to the &s;ub|jects

of them, be&s;ides tho&s;e which are made, or at lea&s;t fixed, by rational, &s;ober, and hone&s;t methods, with the concurrence and ble&s;&s;ing of Him, who <Q>worketh all in all.</Q> It might be added, as a farther rea&s;on for this manner of addre&s;s, that the &s;ubject is, in its own nature, &s;o univer&s;ally intere&s;ting and affecting, and the pa&s;&s;ions of people &s;o generally rai&s;ed to an high pitch already, by the late providential occurrences, that there is, perhaps, more need to bring them to calm reflec|tion, by treating the &s;ubject in a &s;ober, argumentative way, than to ruffle them &s;till more, by treating it in a way altogether rhetorical and pathetic: Though I am &s;en&s;ible, that no one who has a ju&s;t feeling of its importance, can di&s;cour&s;e coldly upon it; which would, indeed, be an inexcu&s;able impropriety. He that can &s;peak of the di&s;&s;olution of all things, of the heavens and the earth in flames, of eternal judg|ment, and of that day of God, which i&s;&s;ues in the glorious reward and triumph of the &s;aints, and in the "perdition of ungodly men"; he that can &s;peak of &s;uch things in a cold, icy, unaffecting &s;tile, does not him&s;elf believe what he &s;ays, but only acts a part; and that, &s;o unnaturally and ab&s;urdly, as could not but di&s;gu&s;t every judicious hearer. To return, there|fore; let us,</P>
<P>FIRST inquire, what tho&s;e things are, of which St. <HI>Peter</HI> is here &s;peaking; and all which, he a&s;&s;ures us, &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved? "Seeing then that all the&s;e things," &amp;c. i. e. the things which he had mentioned in the pre|ceeding

context. They are called <Q>the heavens and the earth, which now are,</Q> ver. 7. and ver. 10 they are more particularly di&s;tributed into <Q>the hea|vens, the elements, the earth al&s;o, and the works that are therein.</Q> It immediately following in the text, "Seeing then that all the&s;e things," &amp;c. it is evident the apo&s;tle mu&s;t intend, not only all tho&s;e things which men them&s;elves cannot but look upon to be fading, tran&s;itory and peri&s;hing; but al&s;o tho&s;e which appear to be the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial and durable: all the cities and towers, the temples and monuments of the world, however deep and &s;trong their founda|tions may be laid, and tho' built for perpetuity; all the magnificent works of men; all the products of human art and power, thro' &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages; all the mighty babels which either pride and vanity, or fear, has erected, tho' their tops &s;hould reach to hea|ven; all the&s;e things &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved. And not only all the&s;e works of men, but the earth it&s;elf, which is the work of God, and which contains and &s;upports them; this habitable world it&s;elf, which &s;eems &s;o &s;olid and durable. The "everla&s;ting hills" &s;hall not la&s;t forever: the loftie&s;t mountains, with their rocks of adamant, and the very elements them&s;elves, of which the earth is compo&s;ed; all the&s;e things expect their di&s;&s;olution. Yea, the di&s;&s;olution will extend even beyond this earth, to the air and atmo&s;phere which &s;urround and infold it, as in a garment; if not to the planetary regions al&s;o, and this whole &s;olar &s;y&s;tem. For &s;ome are of opinion, that by the hea|vens
<PB N="12" REF="007487_0010_102b84909f06f288">
St. <HI>Peter</HI> intends, not only the&s;e lower regi|ons, and aerial heavens, but the aetherial al&s;o, with the &s;un and planets. And although there are objections again&s;t this &s;uppo&s;ition, yet it cannot be denied that the opinion is favoured by &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, if we take them in that &s;en&s;e, which fir&s;t and mo&s;t readily offers it&s;elf to the mind. Thus P&s;alm cii.25, 26. which is quoted by the author to the Hebrews, chap. vii. <Q>Of old ha&s;t thou laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They &s;hall peri&s;h, but thou &s;halt endure. Yea, all of them &s;hall wax old like a garment; as a ve&s;ture &s;halt thou change them, and they &s;hall be changed.</Q> It is far from being certain that the heavens and the earth, are here u&s;ed metaphorically, either for men of high degree, and of low, or for the angelical ho&s;ts and hierarchy, and for earthly rulers. They are&punc; perhaps, to be under&s;tood literally, for that material earth, and tho&s;e heavenly bodies, which "in the beginning God created;" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. i.1.</NOTE> which "declare his glory, and &s;hew his handy-work."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xix.1.</NOTE> A pa&s;&s;age in the 12th of Hebrews may be thus li|terally under&s;tood al&s;o, where the author alludes to the &s;haking and quaking of mount Sinai, at the giving of the law, and to a prophecy of <HI>Haggai</HI> concerning what &s;hould come to pa&s;s under the reign of the Me&s;&s;iah, or rather at the clo&s;e thereof, when the pe|riod comes for his <Q>delivering up the kingdom to God, even the Father.</Q> "If they e&s;caped not,"
<PB N="13" REF="007487_0011_102b8492237be0a8">
&s;ays he, <Q>who refu&s;ed him that &s;pake on earth, much more &s;hall not we e&s;cape, if we turn away from him that &s;peaketh from heaven; who&s;e voice then &s;hook the earth: but now he hath promi&s;ed &s;aying, yet once more, I &s;hake not the earth only, but al&s;o heaven. And this, 'yet once more', &s;igni|fieth the removing of tho&s;e things that are &s;haken, as of things that are made, that tho&s;e things which cannot be &s;haken may remain.</Q> I am &s;en&s;ible that a figurative interpretation is u&s;ually put upon this pa&s;&s;age: but it may admit of &s;ome doubt, whe|ther it ought to be thus under&s;tood. For &s;ince the &s;haking of the earth, in the former part of the pa&s;|&s;age, where the apo&s;tle refers to the giving of the law, plainly means a literal &s;haking of it, is it not mo&s;t natural to under&s;tand literally what follows in the latter part of it, concerning the &s;haking of the hea|vens, "as of things that are made?" And it is to be ob&s;erved, that &s;ome mighty concu&s;&s;ion, and certain great changes, of the heavenly bodies, as well as of this earth, &s;eem plainly foretold in the revelation of St. <HI>John,</HI> when that important period &s;hall arrive, to which St. <HI>Peter</HI> alludes in the text. <Q>And I beheld when he had opened the &s;ixth &s;eal, and lo, there was a great earthquake, and the &s;un became black as &s;ackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; and the &s;tars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig-tree ca&s;teth her untimely figs, when &s;he is &s;haken of a mighty wind; and the heaven departed as a &s;crowl when it is rolled together;
<PB N="14" REF="007487_0012_102b84944017c208">
and every mountain and i&s;land were moved out of their places.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. vi.12, 13, 14.</NOTE> It &s;eems not unlikely that the &s;ame period, and the &s;ame great events, are referred to, in the prophecy of <HI>I&s;aiah:</HI> <Q>My &s;alvation is gone forth, and mine arms &s;hall judge the people&mdash;Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens &s;hall vani&s;h away like &s;moke, and the earth &s;hall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein &s;hall die in like man|ner: but my &s;alvation &s;hall be forever, and my righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall not be aboli&s;hed.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. li. 5, 6.</NOTE> I leave every one to judge for him&s;elf, after carefully ex|aming and comparing the&s;e, and &s;uch like pa&s;&s;ages, whether it is this earth only which is to be di&s;&s;olved?</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t not enlarge upon this head any fur|ther. The things which St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;peaks of in the text, are certainly all tho&s;e things which are compre|hended, in the preceeding ver&s;es, under the&s;e terms, the "heavens," the "elements," the "earth," and the "works that are therein." And by comparing other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which predict the mighty changes and revolutions which &s;hall hereafter take place in the natural, vi&s;ible world, it appears mo&s;t probable to me, that the apo&s;tle intends this whole &s;y&s;tem, inclu&s;ive of the &s;un and planetary regions, as well as this habitable world, with all its furniture. Thus far, it is not unlikely, this great di&s;&s;olution will extend. Wherefore</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007487_0013_102b849684bb2e80">SECONDLY, let us inquire more particularly what is to be under&s;tood by the di&s;&s;olution of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>NO one, certainly, can hereby under&s;tand their annihilation; or &s;uppo&s;e that they are all, at length, to vani&s;h into nothing, and, by being blotted out of, leave a mighty void and blank in, the creation of God. The language of &s;cripture, indeed, evidently implies the contrary: For no man by the "di&s;&s;olving," by the "&s;haking," the "removing," the <Q>folding up</Q> and "changing" of things, or even by their "peri&s;hing," under&s;tands their cea&s;ing to be, or a de|privation of exi&s;tence. But neither, upon the other hand, can all the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions which the &s;criptures make u&s;e of with reference to this matter, mean only &s;ome little, incon&s;iderable alterations in the external form, qualities, and appearances of the things intend|ed. They undoubtedly mean, in general, &s;ome mighty and a&s;toni&s;hing revolutions and changes in the material, vi&s;ible world; &s;ome great cata&s;trophe which is to befal it, in &s;ome future period, &s;o that it may be &s;aid to be de&s;troyed, and to become a wide extended ruin: They imply, that the whole pre&s;ent frame and cour&s;e of nature &s;hall be altered; all things putting on a very different a&s;pect from that which they now wear, &s;o as to have the appearance rather of a world laid in ruins, than of a regular, beautiful fa|brick, as it is in general at pre&s;ent; though it has evi|dently been impaired and damaged in &s;ome degree
<PB N="16" REF="007487_0014_102b8498629689b8">
already, and is daily going to decay and de&s;truction. Nothing le&s;s than this can be implied in the di&s;&s;o|lution of all the&s;e things; in their waxing old and pe|ri&s;hing; in their being folded up and changed; in the powers of heaven and earth being &s;haken, &amp;c.</P>
<P>AS to this earth, our pre&s;ent &s;cene of action, and in the fate and fortune of which, we &s;eem to be more e&s;pecially intere&s;ted; the &s;criptures plainly inform us, that it &s;hall be thus ruined, thus de&s;troyed: And they teach us &s;till more particularly, by what means this de&s;truction and di&s;&s;olution &s;hall be affected, or brought about; namely, by fire. And whatever St. <HI>Peter</HI> may intend in the context, by the heavens, he extends the future conflagration to them, not limiting it to this habitable earth. It may &s;eem &s;trange that the &s;ame world &s;hould be &s;ubjected to two &s;uch dif|ferent cata&s;trophes, as fir&s;t to be drowned, and then burned. But the apo&s;tle having mentioned the former, in the preceeding context, foretels the latter, in the following language. <Q>But the heavens and the earth which now are,&mdash;are kept in &s;tore, re&s;erved unto fire</Q>&mdash;<Q>The heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e, and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat, the earth al&s;o and the works that are therein &s;hall be burnt up.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. iii.7, &amp; 10.</NOTE> And when the apo&s;tle imme|diately &s;ubjoins, <Q>Seeing then that all the&s;e things &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved,</Q> &amp;c. it is manife&s;t that he means, thus de&s;troyed, thus di&s;&s;olved and ruined, by fire; by a general flame, that &s;hall embrace and wrap
<PB N="17" REF="007487_0015_102b8ef8442ff1f8">
them up, and prey upon them till they are reduced, as it were, to one mighty burning ma&s;s, or fiery chaos.

<P>WE con&s;idered, in the morning, What things tho&s;e are, of which St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;peaks in the text; all which are to be di&s;&s;olved: Viz, whatever is comprehended in the context under the&s;e terms, the "heavens", the "elements", the "earth", and the "works that are therein".</P>

<P>And,</P>
<P>LASTLY, we con&s;idered when this great and inter|e&s;ting event &s;hall come to pa&s;s; Viz. at our Saviour's &s;econd appearing, to judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s; at that period, which is called in the text and context, the "day of judgment," the "day of the Lord," and the "day of GOD."</P>
<P>I NOW proceed, as was propo&s;ed, and in conformity to the original &s;cope of the pa&s;&s;age, to improve this reflection, that all the&s;e things &s;hall be thus di&s;&s;olved, at the mentioned period, as a motive to excite you to univer&s;al holine&s;s, and thereby to prepare for the time when this event &s;hall come to pa&s;s.

"Now we be&s;eech you, brethren," &s;ays he, <Q>by the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not &s;oon &s;haken in mind, or be troubled, neither by &s;pirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Chri&s;t is at hand.

And, indeed, were I to give my real opinion, it would be, that this great day of the Lord, and con&s;equently the di&s;|&s;olution of all the&s;e things, is &s;till very remote in fu|turity. For I humbly conceive, from the &s;eries of prophecies, particularly in the Revelation of St. <HI>John,</HI> re&s;pecting the things that were to come to pa&s;s be|fore the con&s;ummation of all things, that many of the events therein predicted, are not yet accompli&s;h|ed; and that many ages are nece&s;&s;ary for the fulfil|ment of them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I may be mi&s;taken; and, as was intimated before, would be cautious in what I &s;ay upon this point. For I had much rather, from the certainty that this day will come, &s;ooner or later, exhort you to be circum&s;pect, and diligent in preparing for it, than, by confidently a&s;&s;erting that it is at a great di&s;tance, even &s;eem to give any countenance to a contrary behaviour. I &s;ay, "even &s;eem" to do &s;o: becau&s;e our obligation

to be holy in all our conver&s;ation, would not really and properly &s;peaking, be le&s;&s;ened, even tho' we were a&s;&s;ured that the day of God was very remote; pro|vided it will certainly come at la&s;t. For, as was inti|mated above, it is not &s;o much from the &s;uppo&s;ed near|ne&s;s or di&s;tance of this period, that our obligation, in point of rea&s;on, ari&s;es, to make preparation for it, as from the nature of the thing it&s;elf, the certainty of it, and the concern we have in it: And con&s;equently, its &s;uppo&s;ed, or even known remotene&s;s, could not much, if at all, dimini&s;h our obligation to be univer|&s;ally holy, this day being certainly future, and hour|ly approaching.

Truly wi&s;e and pro|vident men will live as "&s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world," tho' they may believe the day of the Lord is far di&s;tant, as if they knew it was at hand. For ought not men, in poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of rea&s;on, duty and intere&s;t, to ab&s;tain from tho&s;e &s;ins, which will cer|tainly damn them a thou&s;and or a million years hence, as if they would damn them within an hundred, fifty, or ten? On the other hand, will not a man who acts upon the principles of rea&s;on, be as &s;ollicitous to be|come entitled to eternal life and glory in the kingdom of heaven, altho' he believes it will be long before he can come to the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment thereof, provided it is certainly attainable, as if he might arrive at this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment in a much &s;horter time?

So that I had almo&s;t applied to a truly wi&s;e man, who&s;e care and providence for him&s;elf rap him into &s;cenes and ages to come, even into all futurity, what is &s;aid in the context concerning the all-wi&s;e God, who&s;e care and providence extend to all things, and to whom are known <Q>all his works from the beginning;</Q> &mdash; That with him, <Q>one day is as a thou&s;and years, and a thou&s;and years as one day.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 26.</NOTE></P>

But though, as was &s;aid above, we, in this country, have divers times before been vi&s;ited and admoni&s;hed in this way; yet I think it is generally acknowledged, that the fir&s;t of the late Earthquakes, was both greater, and of longer conti|nuance, than any other which has been known among&s;t us; the effects of it, which I need not enumerate to you, being certainly much more con&s;iderable. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing concerning the natural cau&s;e, or cau&s;es of Earthquakes, which may perhaps be vari|ous;

that being, as I apprehend, quite foreign from the bu&s;ine&s;s of preaching, and therefore, at be&s;t, im|pertinent in a &s;ermon upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. But I mu&s;t ju&s;t remind you, that all things and events, whether natural or preternatural, are under one, &s;u|preme, uniform DIRECTION, unle&s;s there is either no God, or more than One. The con&s;equence of which is, that even natural effects and events, are to be traced up to this &s;upreme, original cau&s;e of all things, who&s;e coun&s;el and providence govern the world; and His hand, to be acknowledged in them.</P>
<P>MY bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore, is to make a religious im|provement of the&s;e vi&s;itations of divine providence: And, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ble&s;&s;ing of Him, who <Q>doeth great things pa&s;t finding out, and wonders without number,</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job ix.10.</NOTE> to &s;et home upon, and fix in your minds and con&s;ciences, tho&s;e &s;entiments of reli|gion, which ought to be, and I doubt not are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, awakened therein, by the&s;e occurren|rences; tho&s;e &s;entiments concerning the power, ma|je&s;ty, and univer&s;al dominion of God, and your de|pendence upon him; tho&s;e &s;entiments concerning the great bu&s;ine&s;s of human life; concerning death, a future &s;tate, the di&s;&s;olution of all things, and eter|nal judgment; which the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations of provi|dence are &s;o naturally adapted to produce in the minds, and to impre&s;s upon the con&s;ciences of men.</P>
<P>As the natural and moral world are under one and the &s;ame common direction or government; &s;o God's

end in all things, however various and diver&s;e, is really one and uniform. There is a &s;ubordination of one thing to another; and a va&s;t apparent variety among&s;t them; but there is al&s;o a connection and dependence of one with and upon, another; and all tend to the &s;ame point at la&s;t; the moral perfection and happine&s;s of creatures capable of it, or the glory of God; which, in any good and intelligible &s;en&s;e, &s;eems to amount to the &s;ame thing. Accordingly, even we can &s;ee innumerable things in God's natu|ral government over the world, and in the common cour&s;e of his providence, which are wi&s;ely ordered with re&s;pect to his moral government; being &s;uited and adapted, con&s;idering what our frame is, to pro|mote, not a &s;uper&s;titious fear, but a ju&s;t reverence of Him, in the minds of men; a religious &s;en&s;e of his wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s; and of the obligations which we are under to him; that is, in others words, to promote religion and righteou&s;ne&s;s among&s;t men: So that the ultimate end of them is moral, tho' the things them&s;elves may be, and are natural; and tho' other &s;ubordinate ends may generally, if not always, be an&s;wered by them in God's natural government; the whole of which, as was intimated before, is &s;ub|ordinate to his moral, and conducted with a view thereto. Thus all tho&s;e effects, however natural, common and familiar, which di&s;play the perfections and glory of God, are plain, though &s;ilent admoni|tions of his providence, to reverence and love, to adore and &s;erve him.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="007487_0058_102b8f4b66e74e08">BUT in this light we may more e&s;pecially con&s;ider whatever effects or events in the natural world, are &s;tupendous and great; and which, partly from their unu&s;ualne&s;s, tho' not wholly &s;o, but from their natural maje&s;ty and grandeur al&s;o, &s;trike the mind with a certain awe and &s;olemnity, better known than it can be de&s;cribed or explained. All the&s;e things, e&s;peci|ally when any apprehen&s;ion of harm or danger is connected with them, have a peculiar tendency to lead our thoughts up to the great Creator, Upholder, and Governor of the univer&s;e: And a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of them, at proper intervals, contributes not a little, as I imagine, to rou&s;e the attention of mankind to, and fix it upon, tho&s;e things of a moral and religious concernment, which ought to be attended to even without them; and &s;o to pre&s;erve that &s;en&s;e of God and religion in the world, which, without them, would, perhaps, be lo&s;t out of it in a few generations. For &s;uch is the make of man, that if all things &s;hould go on in the world in one even, uniform manner and tenor, nothing of this &s;ort occuring from one age to another, to alarm and arre&s;t our attention, it is not unlikely that mankind would grow forgetful of God; and, by degrees, fall into a total &s;ceptici&s;m and infi|delity; the certain con&s;equence of which, is great depravity of manners.

<P>I WILL hazard the imputation of &s;uper&s;tition &s;o far as to confe&s;s, that when I get into this train of thought and reflection, which is not &s;eldom, I cannot but con|&s;ider what I have now been mentioning, <HI>viz.</HI> the turn|ing of mens thoughts and attention to God, as the moral, ultimate end of remarkable tempe&s;ts; of great &s;torms of wind, thunder, lightning and hail, e&s;pe|cially at unu&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons of the year; of luminous and &s;trange appearances in the &s;ky and heavens; of the aurora borealis, comets and blazing meteors; of the mighty &s;wellings, roarings and inundations of the &s;ea, which are &s;ometimes ob&s;erved; of the erup|tions of volcanos; and more e&s;pecially of Earthquakes. The&s;e, and &s;uch-like things, I doubt not, are all de|&s;igned in providence to awaken the attention of a care|le&s;s, &s;inful world, from time to time, to religion. And tho' we have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to think them preter-natural; yet tho&s;e mu&s;t have but very low and un|worthy conceptions of the infinite wi&s;dom of God, who imagine he could not have originally planned, adju&s;ted and adapted them, to the moral &s;tate of the world; &s;o that, without any miraculous interpo&s;ition of his, they &s;hould occur at &s;uch times and places, in all &s;ucceeding generations, wherein they would be&s;t &s;ub&s;erve the ultimate end of his government. And if this is the ca&s;e, it is plain that exactly the &s;ame religious improvement is to be made of them, as if

they were the immediate, preternatural exertions of his power.

<P>SOME of the things mentioned, have a more im|mediate tendency than others of them, to promote religion in the world; I mean tho&s;e which, by putting us in fear for our&s;elves, and by &s;en&s;ibly and directly convincing us of our own weakne&s;s and dependent condition, lead us to almighty God as our only refuge, and the great object of our tru&s;t; giving us, at the &s;ame time, a demon&s;tration more convincing than any merely rational one, of the danger of offending him: <Q>Put them in fear, O Lord! &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, that that the nations may know them&s;elves to be but men.</Q> And when men once throughly know them&s;elves to be but men, weak, helple&s;s, dependent creatures, they cannot well help knowing al&s;o, that God is GOD; the mighty Lord and Sovereign of all, who doeth his will in the heavens above, in the earth below, and "in all keep places"; and con&s;equently, that it is equally their duty and intere&s;t, by reverenc|ing and obeying him, to &s;ecure his favour and pro|tection. When we behold the maje&s;ty of God in the &s;tormy wind and tempe&s;t, while <Q>his voice maketh the hinds to calve</Q>, rending the lofty &s;ons of the fore&s;t, and the very rocks and mountain, in pieces;

<P>IT is evident that this is actually, in &s;ome degree, the moral effect of the&s;e &s;tupendous manife&s;tations of God's power, in the cour&s;e of his providence; which, by the way, is one argument that this is the moral end of them.

It makes a man at once &s;ee and feel that he is nothing; and that God is all, and in all. Tho' void of rea&s;on, it rea&s;ons more effectually than an Apo&s;tle; or, at lea&s;t, &s;hakes

<P>IN fine; Let us all in common, by the&s;e &s;olemn warnings and admonitions of providence; (for we can|not but account them &s;uch; indications of God's righteous di&s;plea&s;ure, and loud calls to a univer&s;al re|formation of manners) Let us all in common, I &s;ay, and chu&s;e to repeat it, <Q>by the&s;e &s;olemn warnings and admonitions of providence,</Q> be excited &s;eri|ou&s;ly to con&s;ider of our ways; to reform what is ami&s;s in our&s;elves; and diligently to attend to the great and ultimate bu&s;ine&s;s of human life; which is the fearing of God, and keeping his commandments: For this is the "whole of man", and the <Q>conclu&s;ion of the whole matter.</Q> Do you imagine that God has no more Earthquakes at command! and even

far more terrible and fatal ones, with which, not only to cha&s;ti&s;e, but even to de&s;troy, a guilty, irreclaimable people, if He plea&s;es!&mdash;Let the&s;e providential and judicial vi&s;itations, in&s;pire us therefore, not only now, but always, with a due reverence, and with awful thoughts of the inconceivable greatne&s;s, power and maje&s;ty of Him, who <Q>removeth the mountains, and they know not</Q>; who <Q>taketh up the i&s;les as a very little thing</Q>; who <Q>&s;itteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as gro&s;hop|pers; who &s;tretcheth out the heavens as a curtain</Q>; who is equally able, and equally determined, to &s;ave the righteous, and to de&s;troy the wicked. Till we think in &s;ome mea&s;ure worthily of God, we &s;hall not think "&s;oberly of our&s;elves, as we ought to think"; nor conduct our&s;elves with due lowline&s;s, humility, and reverence towards Him. The&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence, are peculiarly adapted to this mo&s;t im|portant end; to &s;how us all, how intirely we are in God's hands, and at his di&s;po&s;al; how much it con|cerns us to fear and &s;erve him; and <Q>what manner of per&s;ons we ought to be in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s; looking for, and ha&s;ting unto, the coming of the day of God</Q>; that great day, where|in "all the&s;e things &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved".</P>
<P>THOUGH an Earthquake may naturally lead our tho'ts to this important period; yet &s;urely it is not to be compared, in re&s;pect of the terrors of it, to the terrors of that day, when the earth, with the works

This &s;cene &s;hall yours, and mine, and "every eye", one day behold; when both the ma&s;ked hypocrite, who now covereth his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and the unma&s;ked profligate, who&s;e <Q>&s;ins are open before-hand, going before to judg|ment</Q>, &s;hall equally receive the due reward of their deeds; the cunning craftine&s;s of the one, and the brazen effrontery and impudence of the other, utterly for&s;aking him; and leaving him to his de&s;erv|ed perdition! How will tho&s;e wicked, ungodly men, endure the terrors of that day, whom only the quaking of the earth, now throws into con&s;ternation and an|gui&s;h? If we cannot now po&s;&s;e&s;s our &s;ouls in patience, in a calm re&s;ignation of our&s;elves into the hands of God; or be awaked from &s;leep in our beds by an Earthquake, without &s;uch amazement; what inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;to|ni&s;hment will &s;eize the wicked, who &s;hall be awaked from their "&s;leep in the du&s;t of the earth", by the voice of the arch-angel, and the trump of God? and when the fir&s;t objects which their eyes behold, will be their mighty Judge coming in the clouds, and the hea|vens and earth di&s;&s;olving in flames!

<HEAD>APPENDIX, Containing a more particular Account of the late terrible Earthquake, than has yet been publi&s;hed among&s;t us.</HEAD>
<P>IT will not be improper here, by way of appendix, to give &s;ome account of the late terrible Earthquake; as the pre|ceeding di&s;cour&s;es may po&s;&s;ibly fall into the hands of &s;ome, who have not met with any. This brief account &s;hall be arranged, for the &s;ake of per&s;picuity, under the following heads; viz. the time, the duration, the proce&s;s, the extent, and the effects of the Earthquake: Though one or two remarks may, perhaps, be made, which do not directly and properly fall under either of the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>THE Earthquake, I mean the fir&s;t and greate&s;t of the three lately felt at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> was on tue&s;day, <HI>Nov.</HI> 18. 1755, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning; the evening and night preceeding having been calm, &s;erene and plea&s;ant; and &s;uch a great white-fro&s;t being upon the ground in the morning, as I have not ob|&s;erved for many years pa&s;t. By rea&s;on of the difference in peo|ples clocks and watches, they differ at lea&s;t a quarter of an hour as to the preci&s;e time when the &s;hock came on; &s;ome making it but 15 minutes, and others more than 30, after 4 o'Clock. The former, I believe, come neare&s;t the truth; and, probably, do not fix the time more than 3 or 4 minutes too late, if at all.</P>
<P>AS to the duration, or continuance of the Earthquake, people al&s;o differ widely; viz. from 1 minute to 6 or 7. I have very good rea&s;on to think, that they who fix it at a minute and half, or two minutes at mo&s;t, allow time enough.</P>
<P>THE proce&s;s of the earthquake was as follows. It began with a &s;mart pul&s;ation of the earth upwards: I mean this was the fir&s;t motion perceived; for tho&s;e who were awake, generally agree that there was a ru&s;hing, rumbling noi&s;e, a little before any motion was felt. This pul&s;ation was immediately &s;ucceeded by a uni|ver&s;al trembling, or very quick, jarring, vibratory motion, which was horizontal. This motion increa&s;ed for about a quarter of a minute; and then abated for two or three &s;econds. Then came on, all at once, a violent, prodigious &s;hock, as &s;uddenly to ap|pearance, as a thunder-clap breaking upon a hou&s;e; and attend|ed with a great noi&s;e. This &s;udden and great &s;hock was imme|diately
<PB N="2" REF="007487_0076_102b8f6fd3ab1478">
followed by quick and violent concu&s;&s;ions, jerks and wren|ches, attended, as it appeared to me, with an undulatory, waving motion of the whole &s;urface of the ground, not unlike the &s;haking and quaking of a very large bogg. The&s;e concu&s;&s;ions and qua|kings continued at, or very near, their height, for almo&s;t the &s;pace of half a minute. And were &s;o great as to make it difficult for tho&s;e who were &s;tanding or walking, to keep their feet; and, as I am informed, quite impracticable for &s;ome. After this great &s;hock had been gradually declining and going off, near half a minute, there was a very perceptible revival of it, though of no continuance; and &s;o all became, by degrees, &s;till and quiet, in a little more, perhaps, than 1 minute &amp; &frac12; from the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of the Earthquake. This is the mo&s;t exact account I can give of its beginning, progre&s;s and ending, from my own ob&s;ervation compared with the accounts of others.</P>
<P>THE extent of this Earthquake along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, from S. W. to N. E. was, probably, about 800 or 900 miles; for it cannot certainly be determined at pre&s;ent. The province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts</HI>-Bay, &s;eems to have been the center of it. By what we hear from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> about 300 miles di&s;tant upon a direct line, the &s;hock was incon&s;iderable, in compari&s;on of what it was here; and le&s;s than it was at <HI>New-York.</HI> So that it &s;eems pro|bable, it did not reach towards the S. W. beyond <HI>Virginia.</HI> We hear nothing of it, I think, from <HI>Hallifax</HI>; &s;o that we may conclude it was very little, if at all, perceived there. The hithermo&s;t part of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> may therefore be reckoned its N. ea&s;terly boundary; for we are morally certain that it ex|tended near, if not quite &s;o far, by what we hear concerning it in &s;everal parts of the intermediate &s;pace. It is more difficult to a&s;certain its ea&s;tern and we&s;tern limits; or its extent back into the inland country, and out at &s;ea. It extended to all our back &s;ettlements, from which we have heard; to Lake-<HI>George</HI>; and, probably, hundreds of miles beyond. And the &s;hock was &s;o great in the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> 70 leagues E. of this <HI>American</HI> continent, that the people on board a ve&s;&s;el in that longitude, thought they had run a-ground, or &s;truck upon a rock. From whence we may naturally conclude, that this was not the mo&s;t ea&s;terly ex|tent of it by &s;everal hundred miles. And upon the whole it &s;eems probable, that a circle of 900 miles diameter would have hardly inclo&s;ed it: E&s;pecially con&s;idering that it might run in veins and caverns of the earth, much farther one way than another. I &s;hall ju&s;t add here, though it may not, perhaps, be the propere&s;t place for the remark, that the Earthquake &s;eems to have come from the S. W. and to have catch'd along, (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) thro' this part of the continent, as though a
<PB N="3" REF="007487_0077_102b8f715cdd7b08">
train had been laid for it from country to country. For mo&s;t ac|counts we have from the S. W. make the &s;hock con&s;iderably &s;ooner there, than we had it here, and than it was felt to the N. E. of us; &s;o much &s;ooner, that the difference of longitude will &s;carce help us at all in accounting for it.</P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to the effects of this Earthquake, I &s;hall ju&s;t mention the two others which were felt in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> after it. One on the &s;ame morning, about an hour and a quarter after|wards; very generally perceived, though comparatively &s;mall; its continuance not exceeding 15 &s;econds at mo&s;t. The other was on the &s;aturday evening following, about half an hour be|fore 9 o'Clock. This was as much more con&s;iderable than the la&s;t on tue&s;day morning, as that was le&s;s con&s;iderable than the fir&s;t. It came on gradually, with a ru&s;hing noi&s;e; as it al&s;o went off. It was attended with a waving, undulatory motion, as well as a vibratory; its duration &s;carce half a minute. Many other &s;hocks have been felt &s;ince the fir&s;t and the greate&s;t, to the ea&s;t|ward and northward of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; at 20, 30, 40 and 50 miles di&s;tance, if not farther. From the diver&s;ity there was both as to the time and degree of the fir&s;t Earthquake, along this conti|nent; and from the numbers of others that have been perceived to a con&s;iderable degree in &s;ome places, and not at all in places di&s;tant but a few miles from them, we may naturally infer the&s;e two things: That the immediate natural cau&s;e, whatever it be, is (or rather was) not uniform, and aequi-di&s;tant from the &s;ur|face of the ground: And, that it was not very remote from the &s;urface, in &s;ome places. Had either of the&s;e been the ca&s;e, it is at lea&s;t probable, that there would have been a greater uniformi|ty, con&s;ent and agreement, in the time, &s;en&s;ation and effects, than there has been. But not to digre&s;s farther.</P>
<P>THE principal vi&s;ible effects (I mean the phy&s;ical effects) of the Earthquake, are now to be mentioned. The&s;e are not, in|deed, exactly the &s;ame, and equally great, in all places within its verge and limits; as was intimated before. In <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> be&s;ides the throwing down of gla&s;s, pewter, and other moveables in the hou&s;es, about an 100 chimnies, perhaps, were in a manner le|vell'd with the roofs of the hou&s;es: and about 1500 &s;hattered, and thrown down in part. Some were broken off &s;everal feet be|low the top, and by the &s;uddenne&s;s and violence of the jerks. canted horizontally an inch or two over, &s;o as to &s;tand very dan|gerou&s;ly. Some others, thus broken off, were turned round &s;e|veral points of the compa&s;s, as with a circular motion. The roofs of &s;ome hou&s;es were quite broken in by the fall of chim|nies. The ends of about 12 or 15 brick buildings were thrown down, from the top to the eaves of the hou&s;es. Many clocks
<PB N="4" REF="007487_0078_102b8f733863b310">
were &s;topped; and &s;ome wells and pumps became immediately dry. The vane upon the publick Market-hou&s;e was thrown down; the wooden &s;pindle which &s;upported it, though of a con|&s;iderable thickne&s;s, and which had &s;tood the mo&s;t violent gu&s;ts of wind, being broken off. A new vane upon one of the churches in the town, is bent at the &s;pindle which pa&s;&s;es through it, 2 or 3 points of the compa&s;s out of its proper direction; which mu&s;t have been done by a very quick and violent horizon|tal motion. And "A di&s;tiller's ci&s;tern, made of plank, almo&s;t new, and very &s;trongly put together, was bur&s;t to pieces by the agitation of the liquor in it; which was thrown out with &s;uch force as to break down one whole &s;ide of the &s;hed that defended the ci&s;tern from the weather, as al&s;o to &s;tave off a board or two from a fence, at the di&s;tance of 8 or 10 feet from it."</P>
<P>SIMILAR effects to the&s;e, were &s;een out of the town of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; and &s;ome others. Great damage has been &s;u&s;tained in the country towns, by throwing down the &s;tone-wall fence. But what is &s;till more alarming than any thing already mentioned, is the breaches and cha&s;ms made in the ground, in &s;everal places; no le&s;s than four or five in the &s;ingle town of <HI>Pembroke;</HI> out of &s;ome of which cha&s;ms the water has i&s;&s;ued; and many cart-loads of a fine, whitei&s;h, and compre&s;&s;ible &s;ort of &s;and, has been &s;pewed; and, by what I have heard, of a &s;ulphureous nature. And &s;prings, it is &s;aid, are opened in &s;everal parts of the country, which continue flowing; and &s;ome old ones dried up. It is credibly reported, that the ground in one or two places, either upon or near <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> is apparently &s;unk down; &s;ome, I think, &s;ay, &s;everal feet. It is al&s;o reported that a great hill upon the &s;ame <HI>Cape,</HI> is &s;plit in halves; and &s;tands yawning in a hideous manner. We have al&s;o had an account of a prodigious cha&s;m made in the ground at <HI>Newington</HI> in <HI>New-Ham&s;phire,</HI> of 60 rods in length, and near 2 feet in breadth. But of the truth of the&s;e two la&s;t mentioned facts, I am le&s;s certain.</P>
<P>WHEN we reflect &s;eriou&s;ly upon the danger we have been in, were it only by the falling of chimnies, we mu&s;t account it a very great favour, not to &s;ay wonder, in providence, that neither the life nor limb of any per&s;on, has been lo&s;t by means of the Earth|quake! So violent was this concu&s;&s;ion, that had it continued at its greate&s;t height a minute, it is ea&s;y to tell what mu&s;t, with|out a miracle to prevent it, have been the &s;ad effect;&mdash;the throw|ing down of almo&s;t all our brick and &s;tone buildings; and the burying of thou&s;ands in their ruins:&mdash;I mean, if &s;omething &s;till more awful, which I leave to be gue&s;s'd at, had not en&s;ued!</P>
<P>BUT we hear of one effect of the Earthquake at &s;ea, which is &s;till more uncommon, tho' le&s;s alarming to us, than the&s;e upon
<PB N="5" REF="007487_0079_102b8f75508e8298">
the land. For &s;everal of our &s;ea-faring men agree in their ac|counts, that almo&s;t immediately after the earthquake, large num|bers of fi&s;h of different &s;orts, both great and &s;mall, came up to the &s;urface of the water, &s;ome dead, and others dying. I am credibly informed that one of our fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els, at that time out upon the banks, took up, and brought in, &s;everal Quintals of the&s;e fi&s;h. And &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that even the whales have not wholly e&s;caped this de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THUS do <Q>they that go down to the &s;ea in &s;hips, that do bu&s;ine&s;s in great waters,</Q> <Q>&s;ee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep</Q>; while we behold them upon the dry land.&mdash;And it were well if both they and we, took a proper notice of them&mdash;<Q>O Lord! how manifold are thy works! in wi&s;dom but thou made them all. The earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide &s;ea, wherein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> things creeping innumer|able both &s;mall and great bea&s;ts. There go the &s;hips, there is that Leviathan whom thou ha&s;t made to play therein. The&s;e wait all upon dice; that thou maye&s;t give them their meat in due &s;ea&s;on. That thou give&s;t them, they gather: thou open|e&s;t thine hand, they are filled with good. Thou hide&s;t thy face, they are troubled: thou take&s;t away their breath, they die, and return to their du&s;t!</Q></P>
