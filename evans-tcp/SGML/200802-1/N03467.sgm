<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P><HI>_THE following Di&s;cour&s;es were all, excepting the la&s;t, delivered in the Time of the late wonderful Work of God's Power and Grace in this Place, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> publi&s;hed on the earne&s;t De&s;ire of tho&s;e to whom they were preached. The&s;e particular Di&s;cour&s;es are fixed upon, and de&s;igned for the Pre&s;s, rather than others that were deliver'd in that remarkable Sea&s;on, by</HI> their <HI>Election. What has determin'd them in their Choice, is the Experience they hope they have had of &s;pecial Benefit to their Souls from</HI> the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es. <HI>Their De&s;ire to have 'em in their Hands from the Pre&s;s has been long manife&s;ted, and often expre&s;&s;ed to me; Their Earne&s;tne&s;s in it is evident from this, that tho' it be a Year of the greate&s;t publick Charge to them that over has been, by rea|&s;on of the Expence of building a new Meeting Hou&s;e, yet they cho&s;e rather to be at this additional Expence now, tho' it be very con&s;iderable, than to have it delayed ano|ther Year. I am fully &s;en&s;ible that their Value for the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es has ari&s;en more from the Frame in which they heard them, and the Good which they hope they, thro' the &s;overeign Ble&s;&s;ing of God, have received by them, than any real Worth in them: And whatever the Di&s;cour&s;es are in them&s;elves, yet tho&s;e that heard them are not to be blamed or wonder'd at, if that is dear to them, that they hope God has made a Means of &s;aving and everla&s;t|ing Benefit to them. They have much in&s;i&s;ted on this Ar|gument with me, to induce me to comply with their De&s;ire,</HI> viz <HI>that they hoped that the reading the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es would have a Tendency in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to renew the &s;ame Effect in them that was wrought in the hearing, and re|vive the Memory of that great Work of God, which this
<PB N="ii" REF="004239_0003_10040484BAE58B90">
Town has &s;o much Cau&s;e ever to remember; which Argument has been of principal Weight with me, to incline me to think it to be my Duty to comply with their De&s;ire; tho' I can't &s;ay there are no other Con&s;iderations concur|ring to induce me to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>With re&s;pect to the Di&s;cour&s;e on</HI> Ju&s;tification, <HI>be&s;ides the de&s;ire of my People to make it publick, I have been advi&s;ed to it by certain Rev. Gentlemen, my Fathers, that happen'd to be the Hearers of it; (or, at lea&s;t, Part of it,) when preached, who&s;e Opinion and Advice, in &s;uch an Affair, I thought &s;hould be of as great Weight with me as of mo&s;t that I was acquainted with.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Beginning of the late Work of God in this Place was &s;o circum&s;tanced, that I could not but look upon it as a remarkable Te&s;timony of God's Approbation of the Doctrine of</HI> Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, <HI>here a&s;&s;erted and vindicated:&mdash;By the noi&s;e that had a little be|fore been rai&s;ed in this County, concerning that Doctrine, People here &s;eem'd to have their Minds put into an un|u&s;ual Ruffle; &s;ome were brought to doubt of that Way of Acceptance with God, which from their Infancy they had been taught to be the only Way, and many were en|gaged more thoroughly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook into the Grounds of tho&s;e Doctrines they had been educated in:&mdash;The following Di&s;cour&s;e of Ju&s;tification, that was preach'd, (tho' not &s;o fully as it is here printed,) at two publick Lectures, &s;eem'd to be remarkably ble&s;s'd, not only to e&s;tabli&s;h the Judgments of many in this Truth, but to engage their Hearts in a more earne&s;t pur&s;uit of Ju&s;tification, in that Way that had been explained and defended; And</HI> at that Time, <HI>while I was greatly reproached for defending this Doctrine in the Pulpit, and ju&s;t upon my &s;uffering a very open Abu&s;e for it, God's Work wonderfully brake forth a|mong&s;t us, and Souls began to flock to Chri&s;t, as the Sa|viour in who&s;e Righteou&s;ne&s;s alone they hoped to be ju&s;ti|fied: So that this was the Doctrine on which this Work in its Beginning was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded, as it evidently was in the whole progre&s;s of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A great Objection that is made again&s;t the old Pro|te&s;tant Doctrine of</HI> Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, <HI>and the
<PB N="iii" REF="004239_0004_10042B01E27B8F78">
Scheme of tho&s;e Divines that have chiefly defended it, by tho&s;e that value them&s;elves upon the new fa&s;hion'd Divi|nity, is, That the Scheme is too much incumber'd with &s;pe|culative Niceties, and &s;ubtil Di&s;tinctions, that, they &s;ay, &s;erve only to involve the Subject in endle&s;s Controver&s;y and Di&s;pute; whereas, their Scheme, they &s;uppo&s;e, is a plain, ea&s;y, and natural Account of Things. But their Prejudice again&s;t Di&s;tinctions in Divinity, I hum|bly conceive, is carried to a great Extreme. So great, and general, and loud a cry has been rai&s;ed by modern Phi|lo&s;ophers and Divines, again&s;t the &s;ubtil Di&s;tinctions of the Schoolmen, for their learned Impertinence, that many are ready to &s;tart at any Thing that looks like nice Di&s;tinction, and to condemn it for Non&s;en&s;e without Ex|amination. Upon the &s;ame Account, we might expect to have St.</HI> Paul's <HI>Epi&s;tles, that are full of very nice Di&s;tincti|ons, called Non&s;en&s;e, and unintelligible Jargon, had not they the good Luck, to be univer&s;ally received by all Chri&s;tians, as part of the holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our di&s;covering the Ab&s;urdity of the impertinent and ab&s;tru&s;e Di&s;tinctions of the School Divines, may ju&s;tly give us a Di&s;ta&s;te of</HI> &s;uch Di&s;tinctions <HI>as have a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew of Learning in ob&s;cure Words, but convey no Light to the Mind; but I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on why we &s;hould al&s;o di&s;|card tho&s;e that are clear and rational, and can be made out to have their Foundation in Truth; and that altho' they may be &s;uch as require &s;ome Diligence &amp; Attention of Mind clearly to apprehended them. So much of the Scripture Scheme of Ju&s;tification as is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salva|tion, may be very plain and level with the Under&s;tand|ings of the weake&s;t Chri&s;tians; but it does not therefore follow that the Scripture teaches us no more about it, that it would be exceeding profitable for us to know, and by gaining the Knowledge of which, we may obtain a more full a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> clear under&s;tanding of this Doctrine, and be bet|ter able to &s;olve Doubts that may ari&s;e concerning it, and to defend it from the Sophi&s;try &amp; Cavils of &s;ubtil Oppo&s;ers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>'Tis &s;o in mo&s;t of the great Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, that are looked upon as fir&s;t Principles of the Chri&s;tian
<PB N="iv" REF="004239_0005_10040453CCECC2F8">
Faith, that tho' they contain &s;omething that is ea&s;y, yet they al&s;o contain great My&s;teries, and there is room for Progre&s;s in the Knowledge of them, and doubtle&s;s will be to the End of the World; but 'tis unrea&s;onable to expect that this Progre&s;s &s;hould be made, in the Knowledge of Things that are high and my&s;terious, without accurate Di&s;tinction, and clo&s;e Application of Thought: And 'tis al&s;o unrea&s;onable to think that this Doctrine of the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner by a Mediator, &s;hould be without My&s;teries. We all own it to be a Matter of pure Reve|lation, above the Light of natural Rea&s;on, and that 'tis what the infinite Wi&s;dom of God reveal'd in the Go&s;pel mainly appears in, That he hath found out &s;uch a Way of Reconciliation, that neither Men nor Angels could have thought of. And after all, &s;hall we expect that this Way when found out and declared, &s;hall contain no|thing but what is obvious to the mo&s;t cur&s;ory and &s;uper|ficial View, and may be fully and clearly comprehended without &s;ome Diligence, Accuracy, &amp; careful Di&s;tinction?</HI></P>
<P><HI>It the Di&s;tinctions I have made u&s;e of in handling this Subject are found to be incon&s;i&s;tent, trivial, and un&s;crip|tural Niceties, tending only to cloud the Subject, I ought to be willing that they &s;hould be rejected; but if on due Examination they are found both &s;criptural &amp; rational, I humbly conceive that it will be unju&s;t to condemn them, meerly becau&s;e they are Di&s;tinctions, under a Notion that Nicene&s;s in Divinity never helps it, but always perplexes and darkens it. 'Tis to God's own Revelation that I make my Appeal, by which alone we can know in what Way he will be plea&s;ed again to receive into Favour, tho&s;e that have offended him, and incur'd his Di&s;plea&s;ure. If there be any Part of the Scheme here laid down, or any Di&s;tinction here made u&s;e of, not warranted by Scripture, let it be rejected; and if any oppo&s;ite Scheme can be found that is more ea&s;y and plain, having fewer and more ra|tional Di&s;tinctions, and not demon&s;trably incon&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf, and with the Word of God, let it be received. Let the</HI> Arminian <HI>Scheme of Ju&s;tification by our own Vertue, he as</HI> plain <HI>and natural as it will, if at the &s;ame Time 'tis</HI> plainly <HI>contrary to the certain &amp; demon&s;trable Doctrine
<PB N="v" REF="004239_0006_10042B0385E867C8">
of the Go&s;pel, as contained in the Scriptures, we are bound to reject it, unle&s;s we reject the Scriptures them&s;elves, as perplexed and ab&s;urd, and make our &s;elves wi&s;er than God, and pretend to know his Mind better than Him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Di&s;cour&s;e on Ju&s;tification is printed much larger than it was preached; but the practical Di&s;cour&s;es that follow have but little added to them, and now appear in that very plain and unpoli&s;hed Dre&s;s, in which they were fir&s;t prepared and delivered; which was mo&s;tly at a Time, when the Circum&s;tances of the Auditory they were preached to, were enough to make a Mini&s;ter neglect, forget, and de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch Ornaments as Politene&s;s, &amp; Modi&s;hne&s;s of Style and Method, when coming as a Me&s;&s;enger from God to Souls, deeply impre&s;s'd with a Sen&s;e of their Danger of God's everla&s;ting Wrath, to treat with them about their eternal Salvation.&mdash;However unable I am to preach or write po|litely, if I would, yet I have this to comfort me under &s;uch a Defect, that God has &s;hewed us that he don't need &s;uch Talents in Men to carry on his own Work, and that he has been plea&s;ed to &s;mile upon and ble&s;s a very plain, un|fa&s;hionable Way of Preaching. And have we not Rea&s;on to think that it ever has been, and ever will be, God's Man|ner to ble&s;s the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching to &s;ave them that beleive, let the Elegance of Language, and Excellency of Style, be carried to never &s;o great a Height, by the Learn|ing and Wit of the pre&s;ent and future Ages?</HI></P>
<P><HI>What is publi&s;hed at the End, concerning the Excellency of Chri&s;t, is added on my own Motion; thinking that a Di&s;cour&s;e on &s;uch an evangelical Subject, would properly follow others that were chiefly legal and awakening, and that &s;omething of the Excellency of the</HI> Saviour, <HI>was pro|per to &s;ucceed tho&s;e Things that were to &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity of</HI> Salvation. <HI>I pitched upon that particular Di&s;cour&s;e, partly, becau&s;e I had been earne&s;tly importun'd for a Copy of it for the Pre&s;s, by &s;ome in another Town, in who&s;e hearing it was occa&s;ionally preached.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I reque&s;t every Reader's candid Acceptance, and due Improvement of what is here offered, and e&s;pecially would earne&s;tly be&s;eech the People of my own Charge, not to fail of improving tho&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es to tho&s;e Purpo&s;es that they
<PB N="vi" REF="004239_0007_10042B065576E750">
have mentioned to me as the Ends for which they de&s;ired to have them publi&s;hed, that I may have no cau&s;e to re|pent of my Labour in tran&s;cribing, nor they of their Co&s;t in printing them&punc; Happy would it be for us, and an un|&s;peakable Mercy of Heaven, if God &s;hould ble&s;s what is here printed, &s;o to revive the Memory of the pa&s;t great Work of God among&s;t us, and the lively Impre&s;&s;ions and Sen&s;e of divine Things that Per&s;ons then had on their Minds, and to cau&s;e us to lament our Declen&s;ions, as that the &s;ame Work might renewedly break forth and go on a|mong&s;t us! Surely we have &s;een much to excite our Long|ings after &s;uch a Mercy, and to encourage us to cry to God for it!</HI></P>

<Q><HI>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE following Things may be noted in this Ver&s;e; 1. That Ju&s;tification re|&s;pects a Man as ungodly: This is evi|dent by tho&s;e Words&mdash;<HI>that ju&s;tifieth the Ungodly.</HI> Which Words can't im|ply le&s;s than that God in the Act of Ju&s;tification, has no Regard to any Thing in the Per&s;on ju&s;tified, as Godli|ne&s;s, or any Goodne&s;s in him; but that nextly, or imme|diately before this Act, God beholds him only as an un|godly or wicked Creature; &s;o that Godline&s;s in the Per|&s;on
<PB N="2" REF="004239_0009_10042B10E0CA8800">
to be ju&s;tified is not &s;o antecedent to his Ju&s;tification as to be the Ground of it. When it is &s;aid that God ju&s;tifies the Ungodly, 'tis as ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that our Godline&s;s, taken as &s;ome Goodne&s;s in us, is the Ground of our Ju&s;tification, as when it is &s;aid that Chri&s;t gave Sight to the Blind, to &s;uppo&s;e that Sight was <HI>Prior to,</HI> and the <HI>Ground of</HI> that Act of Mercy in Chri&s;t, or as if it &s;hould be &s;aid that &s;uch an One by his Bounty has made a poor Man rich, to &s;uppo&s;e that it was the Wealth of this poor Man that was the Ground of this Bounty to|wards him, and was the Price by which it was procured.</P>
<P N="2">2. It appears that <HI>by him that worketh not</HI> in this Ver&s;e, is not meant only one that don't conform to the cere|monial Law, becau&s;e <HI>he that worketh not,</HI> and <HI>the Ungod|ly</HI> are evidently &s;ynonimous Expre&s;&s;ions, or what &s;ignify the &s;ame; it appears by the Manner of their Connection; if it ben't &s;o, to what Purpo&s;e is the latter Expre&s;&s;ion <HI>the Ungodly</HI> brought in? The Context gives no other Occa&s;ion for it, but only to &s;hew that the Grace of the Go&s;pel appears in that God in Ju&s;tification has no Re|gard to any Godline&s;s of ours: The foregoing Ver&s;e is, <HI>Now to him that worketh is the Reward not reckon'd of Grace, but of Debt:</HI> In that Ver&s;e 'tis evident, that Go&s;|pel Grace con&s;i&s;ts in the Rewards being given <HI>without Works;</HI> &amp; in this Ver&s;e which nextly follows it &amp; in Sen&s;e is connected with it, 'tis evident that Go&s;pel Grace con|&s;i&s;ts in a Man's being ju&s;tified that is <HI>ungodly;</HI> by which it is mo&s;t plain that by <HI>him that worketh not,</HI> and him that is <HI>ungodly,</HI> are meant the &s;ame Thing; and that therefore not only Works of the ceremonial Law are ex|cluded in this Bu&s;ine&s;s of Ju&s;tification, but Works of Morality and <HI>Godline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis evident in the Words, that by that Faith that is here &s;poken of, by which we are ju&s;tified, is not meant the &s;ame Thing as a Cour&s;e of Obedience, or Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, by the Expre&s;&s;ion, by which this Faith is here deno|ted, <HI>viz believing on him that ju&s;tifies the Ungodly</HI>&mdash;They that oppo&s;e the <HI>Solifidians,</HI> as they call them, do greatly in&s;i&s;t on it, that we &s;hould take the Words of Scripture concerning this Doctrine, in their mo&s;t natural
<PB N="3" REF="004239_0010_10040456B2BD9408">
and obvious Meaning; and how do they cry out of our clouding this Doctrine with ob&s;cure Metaphors, and un|intelligible Figures of Speech! But is this to interpret Scripture according to it's mo&s;t obvious Meaning, when the Scripture &s;peaks of our <HI>believing on him that ju&s;tifies the Ungodly,</HI> or the <HI>Breakers of his Law,</HI> to &s;ay that the Meaning of it is performing a Cour&s;e of <HI>Obedience to his Law,</HI> and <HI>avoiding the Breaches of it?</HI> Believing on God as a <HI>Ju&s;tifier,</HI> certainly is a different Thing from &s;ubmitting to God as a <HI>Lawgiver;</HI> e&s;pecially a believing on him as a Ju&s;tifier of <HI>the Ungodly,</HI> or Rebels <HI>again&s;t the Lawgiver.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. 'Tis evident that the Subject of Ju&s;tification is look'd upon as de&s;titute of any Righteou&s;ne&s;s in him&s;elf, by that Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>it is counted, or imputed to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> the Phra&s;e, as the Apo&s;tle u&s;es it here, and in the Context, manife&s;tly imports, that God of his &s;overeign Grace is plea&s;ed in his Dealings with the Sin|ner, to take and regard, that which indeed <HI>is not</HI> Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and in one that <HI>has no</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o that the Con&s;equence &s;hall be the &s;ame as if he <HI>had</HI> Righteou&s;|ne&s;s; (which may be from the Re&s;pect that it bears to &s;ome thing that is indeed Righteou&s;ne&s;s.) 'Tis plain that this is the force of the Expre&s;&s;ion in the preceeding Ver&s;es: In the la&s;t Ver&s;e but one, 'tis manife&s;t that the Apo&s;tle lays the Stre&s;s of his Argument for the free Grace of God, from that Text that he cites out of the old Te&s;ta|ment about <HI>Abraham,</HI> on that Word <HI>counted</HI> or <HI>imputed,</HI> and that this is the Thing that he &s;uppo&s;ed God to &s;hew his Grace in, <HI>viz</HI> in his <HI>counting</HI> &s;omething for Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, in his con&s;equential Dealings with <HI>Abraham,</HI> that was no Righteou&s;ne&s;s in it&s;elf. And in the next Ver&s;e which immediately preceeds the Text, <HI>Now to him that worketh is the Reward not</HI> reckoned <HI>of Grace, but of Debt;</HI> the Word there tran&s;lated <HI>reckoned,</HI> is the &s;ame that in the other Ver&s;es is render'd <HI>imputed,</HI> and <HI>counted:</HI> And 'tis as much as if the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid, <Q>As to <HI>him that works,</HI> there is no need of any gracious <HI>Reckoning,</HI> or <HI>counting</HI> it for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and cau&s;ing the Reward to follow <HI>as if it were</HI> a Righteou&s;ne&s;s; for

if he has Works he has that which <HI>is</HI> a Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>in it&s;elf,</HI> to which the Reward properly belongs.</Q> This is further evident by the Words that follow, Ver. 6. <HI>Even as David al&s;o de&s;cribed the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the Man unto whom God imputeth Righteou&s;ne&s;s without Works;</HI> what can here b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> meant by imputing Righteou&s;ne&s;s without Works, but imputing Righteou&s;ne&s;s to him that has none of his own?

<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> I would &s;hew what Ju&s;tification is, or what I &s;uppo&s;e is meant in Scripture by being <HI>ju&s;tified.</HI> And here I would not at all enlarge, and therefore to an&s;wer in &s;hort.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on is &s;aid to be ju&s;tified when he is approved of God as free from the <HI>Guilt</HI> of Sin, and it's de&s;erved <HI>Puni&s;hment,</HI> and as having that <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> belonging to him that entitles to the <HI>Reward</HI> of Life. That we &s;hould take the Word in &s;uch a Sen&s;e, and under&s;tand it as the Judges accepting a Per&s;on as having both a nega|tive, and po&s;itive Righteou&s;ne&s;s belonging to him, and looking on him therefore, as not only <HI>quit,</HI> or free from any Obligation to Puni&s;hment but al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>righ|teous,</HI> and &s;o entitled to a po&s;itive Reward, is not only mo&s;t agreable to the Etimology, and natural Import of the Word, which &s;ignifies to make righteous, or to pa&s;s One for righteous in Judgment, but al&s;o manife&s;tly a|greable to the Force of the Word, as u&s;ed in Scripture.</P>
<P>Some &s;uppo&s;e that nothing more is intended in Scrip|ture by <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> than barely the <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins:</HI> if it be &s;o it is very &s;trange, if we con&s;ider the Nature of the Ca&s;e; for 'tis mo&s;t evident, and none will deny, that it is with Re&s;pect to the Rule, or Law of God that we are under, that we are &s;aid in Scripture to be either ju&s;tified or condemned: Now what is it to ju&s;tify a Per|&s;on, as the Subject of a Law or Rule, but to judge him,
<PB N="6" REF="004239_0013_10042B1454DA7488">
or look upon him, and approve him as <HI>&s;tanding right</HI> with Re&s;pect to that Rule? To ju&s;tify a Per&s;on <HI>in a par|ticular Ca&s;e,</HI> is to approve of him as &s;tanding right, as &s;ubject to the Law or Rule <HI>in that Ca&s;e;</HI> and to ju&s;tify <HI>in general,</HI> is to pa&s;s him in Judgment, as &s;tanding right, in a State corre&s;pondent to the Law or Rule <HI>in general.</HI> But certainly in order to a Per&s;on's being looked on as &s;tanding right with Re&s;pect to the Rule in general, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or in a State corre&s;ponding with the Law of God, more is needful than what is negative, or a not having the Guilt of Sin; for whatever that Law is, whether a <HI>new</HI> one, or an <HI>old</HI> one, yet doubtle&s;s &s;omething po&s;itive is needed in order to its being an&s;wered. We are no more ju&s;tified by the Voice of the Law, or of him that judges according to it, by a meer Pardon of Sin, than <HI>Adam</HI> our fir&s;t Sure|ty, was ju&s;tified by the Law, at the fir&s;t Point of his Ex|i&s;tence, before he had done the Work, or fulfilled the Obedience of the Law, or had had &s;o much as any Trial whether he would fulfil it or no. If <HI>Adam</HI> had fini&s;hed his Cour&s;e of perfect Obedience, he would have been <HI>ju&s;tified;</HI> and certainly his Ju&s;tification would have im|plied &s;omething more than what is meerly negative; he would have been approved of, as having fulfilled the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law, and accordingly would have been adjudged to the Reward of it: So Chri&s;t our <HI>&s;econd Surety,</HI> (in who&s;e Ju&s;tification all who believe in him, and who&s;e Surety he is, are vertually ju&s;tified,) was not ju&s;tified 'till he had done the Work the Father had ap|pointed him, and kept the Father's Commandments, thro' all Trials, and then in his Re&s;urrection he was <HI>ju&s;tified:</HI> When he that had been put to Death in the Fle&s;h was <HI>quickened</HI> by the Spirit, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 18 then he that was ma|nife&s;t in the Fle&s;h was <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> in the Spirit, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16. But God when he ju&s;tified him in rai&s;ing him from the Dead, did not only relea&s;e him from his Humiliation for Sin, and acquit him from any further Suffering or A|ba&s;ement for it, but admitted him to that eternal and immortal Life, and to the Beginning of that Exaltation, that was the Reward of what he had done. And indeed the Ju&s;tification of a Believer is no other than his being
<PB N="7" REF="004239_0014_10042B1856AD5BE0">
admitted to Communion <HI>in&punc;</HI> or Participation <HI>of</HI> the Ju&s;|tification of this Head and Surety of all Believers; for as Chri&s;t &s;uffered the Puni&s;hment of Sin, not as a private Per&s;on, but as our Surety, &s;o when after this Suffering he was rai&s;ed from the Dead, he was therein ju&s;tified, not as a private Per&s;on, but as the Surety and Repre|&s;entative of all that &s;hould believe in him; &s;o that he was rai&s;ed again not only for <HI>his own,</HI> but al&s;o for <HI>our</HI> Ju&s;tification, according to the Apo&s;tle Rom. 4 25. <HI>Who was delivered for our Offences, and rai&s;ed again for</HI> our Ju&s;tification. And therefore it is that the Apo&s;tle &s;ays as he does in Rom. 8. 34. <HI>Who is he that</HI> condemneth, <HI>it is Chri&s;t that died, yea</HI> rather <HI>that is ri&s;en again.</HI></P>
<P>But that a Believer's Ju&s;tification implies not only Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, or Acquittance from the Wrath due to it, but al&s;o an Admittance to a Title to that Glory that is the Reward of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is more directly taught in the Scripture, as particularly in <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 1, 2. where the Apo&s;tle mentions both the&s;e, as joint Benefits implied in Ju&s;tification, <HI>Therefore being</HI> ju&s;tified <HI>by Faith, we</HI> have Peace with God <HI>through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom al&s;o we</HI> have Acce&s;s into this Grace wherein we &s;tand, and rejoice in Hope of the Glory of God. So <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins,</HI> and <HI>Inheritance among them that are &s;anctified,</HI> are mentioned together as what are jointly ob|tained by Faith in Chri&s;t, Acts 26. 18. <HI>That they may receive Forgivene&s;s of Sins, and Inheritance among them that are &s;anctified,</HI> through Faith <HI>that is in me.</HI> Both the&s;e are without Doubt implied in that pa&s;&s;ing from Death to Life, which Chri&s;t &s;peaks of as the Fruit of Faith, and which he oppo&s;es to Condemnation, John. 5. 24 <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you, he that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that &s;ent me, hath everla&s;ting Life, and &s;hall not come into Condemnation, but is pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life.</HI> I proceed now</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> To &s;hew what is meant when it is &s;aid that this Ju&s;tification is by Faith only, and not by any Vertue or Goodne&s;s of our own.</P>
<P>This enquiry may be &s;ubdivided into two, <HI>viz</HI> 1. How 'tis <HI>by Faith.</HI> 2. How 'tis by Faith <HI>alone, without any Manner of Goodne&s;s of ours.</HI></P>

1. <HI>How Ju&s;tification is by Faith.</HI> Here the great Diffi|culty has been about the Import and Force of the Particle BY, or what is that <HI>Influence</HI> that Faith has in the Affair of Ju&s;tification that is expre&s;&s;ed in Scripture by be|ing <HI>ju&s;tified BY Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Here, if I may humbly expre&s;s what &s;eems evident to me, tho' Faith be indeed the Condition of Ju&s;tification <HI>&s;o as nothing el&s;e is,</HI> yet this Matter is not clearly and &s;uf|ficiently explained by &s;aying that Faith is the <HI>Condition</HI> of Ju&s;tification; and that becau&s;e the Word &s;eems am|biguous, both in common U&s;e, and al&s;o as u&s;ed in Divini|ty: in one Sen&s;e Chri&s;t alone performs the Condition of our Ju&s;tification and Salvation; in another Sen&s;e, Faith is the Condition of Ju&s;tification; in another Sen&s;e, other Qualifications and Acts are Conditions of Salvation and Ju&s;tification too: there &s;eems to be a great deal of ambiguity in &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as are commonly u&s;ed, (which yet we are forced to u&s;e,) &s;uch as <HI>Condition of Salvation, what is required in order to Salvation or Ju&s;ti|fication; the Terms of the Covenant,</HI> and the like; and I believe they are under&s;tood in very different Sen&s;es by different Per&s;ons. And be&s;ides as the Word <HI>Condition</HI> is very often under&s;tood in the common u&s;e of Language, Faith is not the only Thing, in us, that is the Condition of Ju&s;tification; for by the Word Condition, as 'tis very often, (and perhaps mo&s;t commonly,) u&s;ed; we mean a|ny thing that may have the Place of a Condition in a conditional Propo&s;ition, and as &s;uch is truly connected with the Con&s;equent, e&s;pecially if the Propo&s;ition holds both in the Affirmative and Negative, as the Condition is either affirmed or denied; if it be that <HI>with which,</HI> or <HI>which being &s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> a thing &s;hall be, and <HI>without which,</HI> or <HI>it being denied,</HI> a Thing &s;hall not be, we in &s;uch a Ca&s;e call it a Condition of that Thing: But in this Sen&s;e Faith is not the only Condition of Salvation or Ju&s;tification, for there are many Things that accom|pany and flow from Faith, that are Things with which Ju&s;tification &s;hall be, and without which it will not be, and therefore are found to be put in Scripture in condi|tional Propo&s;itions with Ju&s;tification and Salvation. in
<PB N="9" REF="004239_0016_1004045A2DE8B368">
Multitudes of Places; &s;uch are <HI>Love to God, and Love to our Brethren, forgiving Men their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es,</HI> and many other good Qualifications and Acts. And there are ma|ny other Things be&s;ides Faith, which are directly pro|po&s;ed to us, to be pur&s;ued or performed by us, in or|der to eternal Life, as tho&s;e which if they are done, or obtain'd we &s;hall have eternal Life, &amp; if not done or not obtain'd, we &s;hall &s;urely peri&s;h. And <HI>if it were &s;o,</HI> that Faith was the only Condition of Ju&s;tification in this Sen&s;e, yet I don't apprehend that to &s;ay that Faith was the Condition of Ju&s;tification, would expre&s;s the Sen&s;e of that Phra&s;e of Scripture of being <HI>Ju&s;tified BY Faith:</HI> there is a Difference between <HI>being ju&s;tified by a Thing,</HI> and that Thing <HI>univer&s;ally, and nece&s;&s;arily, and in&s;epa|rably attending,</HI> or <HI>going with Ju&s;tification;</HI> for &s;o do a great many Things that we ben't &s;aid to be ju&s;tified by: it is not the in&s;eparable <HI>connection</HI> with ju&s;tifica|tion that the Holy Gho&s;t would &s;ignify, (or that is naturally &s;ignified,) by &s;uch a Phra&s;e, but &s;ome particu|lar <HI>influence</HI> that Faith has in the Affair, or &s;ome certain Dependance that that Effect has on its Influence.</P>
<P>Some that have been aware of this have &s;uppo&s;ed that the influence or dependance might well be ex|pre&s;&s;ed by Faith's being the <HI>In&s;trument</HI> of our Ju&s;tifi|cation; which has been mi&s;under&s;tood, and injuriou&s;|ly repre&s;ented, and ridiculed by tho&s;e that have deni|ed the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, as tho' they had &s;uppo&s;ed that Faith was u&s;ed as an In&s;tru|ment in the Hand of God, whereby he performed, and brought to pa&s;s that Act of his, <HI>viz.</HI> Approving and Ju&s;tifying the Believer: Whereas it was not intend|ed that Faith was the In&s;trument wherewith <HI>God ju&s;|tifies,</HI> but the In&s;trument wherewith <HI>we receive Ju&s;tifi|cation;</HI> not the In&s;trument where with the ju&s;tifier acts in Ju&s;tifying, but wherewith the receiver of Ju&s;tification acts <HI>in accepting</HI> Ju&s;tification. But yet it mu&s;t be own'd that this is an ob&s;cure way of Speaking, and there mu&s;t certainly be &s;ome impropriety in calling of it an In&s;trument wherewith we receive or accept Ju&s;tification; for the very Per&s;ons that thus explain the Matter &s;peak

of Faith as being the <HI>Reception</HI> or <HI>Acceptance it &s;elf;</HI> and if &s;o how can it be the In&s;trument <HI>of</HI> Reception or Acceptance? Certainly there is difference between the Act and the In&s;trument. And be&s;ides by their own De&s;criptions of Faith, Chri&s;t the Mediator, <HI>by whom,</HI> and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>by which</HI> we are ju&s;tified, is more di|rectly the Object of this Acceptance, and Ju&s;tification which is the Benefit ari&s;ing therefrom, more indirectly: and therefore if Faith be an In&s;trument, 'tis more pro|perly the In&s;trument by which we receive Chri&s;t, than the In&s;trument by which we receive Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>But I humbly conceive we have been ready to look too far to find out what that Influence of Faith in our Ju&s;tification is, or what is that Dependance of this Ef|fect on Faith, &s;ignified by the Expre&s;&s;ion of being <HI>ju&s;|tified by Faith,</HI> over looking that which is mo&s;t obvi|ou&s;ly pointed forth in the Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> that, the Ca&s;e being as it is, (there being a Mediator that has purcha&s;ed Ju&s;tification,) Faith in this Mediator is that which renders i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a <HI>meet</HI> and <HI>&s;uitable Thing,</HI> in the Sight of God, that he rather than others &s;hould have this pur|cha&s;ed Benefit a&s;&s;igned to him.

It is certain that there is &s;ome Union or Rela|tion that the People <HI>of Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;tand in <HI>to him,</HI> that is expre&s;&s;ed in Scripture, from time to time, by being <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> and is repre&s;ented frequently by tho&s;e Metaphors of being <HI>Members of Chri&s;t,</HI> or being united to him as <HI>Members to the Head,</HI> and Branches to the Stock,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Our Saviour compares his my&s;tical Body, that is his Church, to a Vine, which his Father, whom he compares to a Husbandman, hath planted, <HI>I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman.</HI> To repre&s;ent to us the <HI>Uni|on</HI> that is betwixt Chri&s;t and all true Chri&s;tians, and the Influence of Grace and &s;piritual Life, which all that are <HI>United</HI> to him do derive and receive from him, he &s;ets it forth to us by the Re&s;emblance of a Vine and Branches. As there is a <HI>natural vital Union</HI> between the Vine and the Branches, &s;o there is a <HI>&s;piritual Union</HI> between Chri&s;t and true Chri&s;tians; and this Union is the Cau&s;e of our Fruitfulne&s;s, in the Works of Obedience and a good Life. There are &s;ome indeed that &s;eem to be <HI>grafted into Chri&s;t</HI> by an out|ward Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, who yet derive no Influence from him, &s;o as to bring forth Fruit, becau&s;e they are not <HI>vitally united to him.</HI></Q> Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> in his 3d. Vol. of Serm. p. 307.</P>
<P>By this it appears that the vital Union between Chri&s;t and true Chri&s;tians, which is much more of a My&s;tery than the relative Union, and nece&s;&s;arily implies it, was not thought an unrea&s;onable Doctrine, by one of the greate&s;t Divines, on the other &s;ide of the Que&s;tion in Hand.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="13" REF="004239_0020_1004045248CE70B8">
and is compared to a Marriage Union between <HI>Husband</HI> and <HI>Wife.</HI> I don't now pretend to determine of what Sort this Union is; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to enter into any Manner of Di&s;putes about it: if any are di&s;gu&s;ted at the Word Union, as ob|&s;cure and unintelligible, the Word <HI>Relation</HI> equally &s;erves my Purpo&s;e; I don't now de&s;ire to determine any more about it, than all, of all Sorts, will readi|ly allow, <HI>viz</HI> that there is a peculiar <HI>Relation</HI> be|tween true Chri&s;tians and Chri&s;t, or a certain Relati|on between him and them, that there is not between him and others; which is &s;ignified by tho&s;e metaphori|cal Expre&s;&s;ions in Scripture, of being <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> being <HI>Members of Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Relation or Union to Chri&s;t, whereby Chri&s;tians are &s;aid to be <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t, (whatever it be,) is the Ground of their Right to his Benefits. This needs no Proof; the Rea&s;on of the Thing, at fir&s;t Blu&s;h, demon&s;trates it: but yet 'tis exceeding evident al&s;o by Scripture, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5. 12. <HI>He that hath the Son hath Life, and he that hath not the Son hath not Life.</HI> 1 Cor. 1. 3. <HI>Of him are ye in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us&mdash;Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Fir&s;t we mu&s;t be in him, and then he will be made Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or Ju&s;tification to us. Eph. 1. 6. <HI>Who hath made us ac|cepted
<PB N="14" REF="004239_0021_10042B269A1FA328">
in the Beloved.</HI> Our being <HI>in him</HI> is the Ground of our being accepted. So it is in tho&s;e Unions which the Holy Gho&s;t has thought fit to compare this Union to; the Union of the Members of the Body with the Head is the Ground of their partaking of the Life of the Head; 'tis the Union of the Branches to the Stock, which is the Ground of their partaking of the Sap &amp; Life of the Stock; 'tis the Relation of the Wife to the Husband, that is the Ground of her joynt Intere&s;t in his E&s;tate, they are looked upon, in &s;everal Re&s;pects, as one in Law: &s;o there is a legal Union between Chri&s;t and true Chri&s;tians; &s;o that (as all except <HI>Socinians</HI> allow,) <HI>one,</HI> in &s;ome re&s;pects, is <HI>accepted for the other,</HI> by the &s;u|preme Judge.</P>
<P N="3">3. And thus it is that Faith is that Qualification in any Per&s;on, that renders it meet in the Sight of God that he &s;hould be looked upon as having Chri&s;t's Satis|faction and Righteou&s;ne&s;s belonging to him, <HI>viz. be|cau&s;e it is that in him, which, on his Part, makes up this Union between him and Chri&s;t.</HI> By what has been ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, 'tis a Per&s;on's being, according to Scripture Phra&s;e, <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> that is the Ground of hav|ing his Satisfaction and Merits belonging to him, and a Right to the Benefits procured thereby: and the Rea|&s;on of it is plain; 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee how a having Chri&s;t's Merits and Benefits <HI>belonging to us,</HI> follows from our having (if I may &s;o &s;peak) <HI>Chri&s;t him&s;elf belonging to us,</HI> or a being united to him; and if &s;o it mu&s;t al&s;o be ea&s;y to &s;ee how, or in what Manner, that, in a Per&s;on, that on his Part makes up the Union between his Soul &amp; Chri&s;t, &s;hould be the Thing on the Account of which God looks on it meet that he &s;hould have Chri&s;t's Merits belonging to him; and al&s;o that it is a very different Thing, for God to a&s;&s;ign to a particular Per&s;on, a Right to Chri&s;t's Merits and Benefits, from Regard to any Qua|lification in him, in this Re&s;pect, from his doing of it for him, out of Re&s;pect to the Value or Loveline&s;s of that Qualification, or as a Reward of the Excellency of it.</P>
<P>As there is no Body but what will allow that there is a peculiar Relation between Chri&s;t &amp; his true Di&s;ciples,
<PB N="15" REF="004239_0022_10042B2CDC30FAE0">
by which they are in &s;ome &s;en&s;e in scripture &s;aid to be one; &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e there is no Body but what will al|low, that there may be &s;omething that the true Chri&s;ti|an does on his Part, whereby he is <HI>active in coming into this Relation</HI> or <HI>Union,</HI> &s;ome Act of the Soul of the Chri&s;tian, that is the Chri&s;tian's <HI>uniting Act,</HI> or that which is done towards this Union or Relation, (or whatever any plea&s;e to call it,) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Chri&s;tian's Part: Now Faith I &s;uppo&s;e to be this Act</P>
<P>I don't now pretend to define ju&s;tifying Faith, or to determine preci&s;ely how much is contain'd in it, but only to determine thus much concerning it, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is that by which the Soul, that before was &s;eperate, and alienated from Chri&s;t, unites it &s;elf to him, or cea&s;es to be any longer in that State of Alienation, and comes into that &s;ore mention'd Union or Relation to him, or to u&s;e the Scripture Phra&s;e, that 'tis that by which the Soul COMES TO Chri&s;t, and RECEIVES him: and this is evident by the Scriptures u&s;ing the&s;e very Expre&s;&s;i|ons to &s;ignify Faith. John 6&punc; 35, 36, 37, 38, 39&punc; <HI>He that</HI> cometh <HI>to me &s;hall never hunger, and he that</HI> believeth <HI>on me &s;hall never thir&s;t.

And this is the Will of him that &s;ent me, that every one which &s;eeth the Son and</HI> believeth <HI>on him, may have everla&s;ting Life, and I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t Day.</HI> Chap. 5&punc; 38, 39, 40.&mdash;<HI>Whom he hath &s;ent, him ye</HI> believe <HI>not.

they might be well under&s;tood of Old, among tho&s;e that then commonly u&s;ed &s;uch Metaphors, yet they are difficultly under&s;tood now. I allow that the Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>receiving</HI> Chri&s;t and <HI>coming</HI> to Chri&s;t, are metapho|rical Expre&s;&s;ions; and if I &s;hould allow 'em to be ob|&s;cure Metaphors; yet &s;o much at lea&s;t, is certainly <HI>plain</HI> in 'em, <HI>viz.</HI> that Faith is that by which tho&s;e that before were <HI>&s;eperated,</HI> and <HI>at a di&s;tance</HI> from Chri&s;t, (that is to &s;ay were not &s;o related and united to him as his People are;) do cea&s;e to be any longer at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, and do <HI>come into that Relation</HI> and near|ne&s;s; unle&s;s they are &s;o unintelligible, that nothing at all can be under&s;tood by 'em.</P>
<P>God don't give tho&s;e that believe, an Union <HI>with,</HI> or an intere&s;t <HI>in</HI> the Saviour, in <HI>reward</HI> for Faith, but only becau&s;e Faith is the Soul's active uniting with Chri&s;t, or is it &s;elf the very act of Unition, on their Part. God &s;ees it fit, that in order to an Union's be|ing e&s;tabli&s;hed between two intelligent active Beings or Per&s;ons, &s;o as that they &s;hould be looked upon as one, there &s;hould be the mutual Act of both, that each &s;hould receive other, as actively joining them&s;elves one to another. God in requiring this in order to an union with Chri&s;t as one of his People, treats Men as rea&s;onable Creatures, capable of Act, and Choice; and hence &s;ees it fit that they only, that are <HI>one</HI> with Chri&s;t <HI>by their own Act,</HI> &s;hould be looked upon <HI>as one in Law:</HI> what is <HI>real</HI> in the Union betwen Chri&s;t and his People, is the Foundation of what is <HI>legal;</HI> that is, it is &s;omething that is <HI>really</HI> in them, &amp; between them, uniting them, that is the Ground of the Suitablene&s;s of their being <HI>accounted</HI> as one by the Judge: And if there be any Act, or Qualification in Believers, that is of that uniting Nature, that it is meet on that Account that the Judge &s;hould look upon 'em, and accept 'em as one, no wonder that upon the Account of the &s;ame Act or Qualification, he &s;hould accept the Satisfaction and Merits of the one, for the other, as if it were their Satisfaction and Merits: It nece&s;&s;arily follows, or ra|ther is implied.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004239_0024_100404639FB67050">
And thus it is that Faith ju&s;tifies, or gives an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t's Satisfaction and Merits, and a Right to the Benefits procured thereby, <HI>viz.</HI> as it thus makes Chri&s;t and the Believer <HI>one</HI> in the Acceptance of the &s;upreme Judge. 'Tis by Faith that we have a Title to eter|nal Life, becau&s;e, tis by Faith that we have the Son of God, by whom Life is. The Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> in tho&s;e Words, 1 John 5. 12. <HI>He that hath the son hath Life,</HI> &s;eems evidently to have re&s;pect to tho&s;e Words of Chri&s;t that he gives an Account of in his Go&s;pel, Chap. 3. 36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son hath everla&s;ting Life, and he that believeth not the Son &s;hall not &s;ee Life.</HI> And in the &s;ame Places that the Scripture &s;peaks of Faith as the Soul's <HI>receiving,</HI> or <HI>coming to Chri&s;t,</HI> it al&s;o &s;peaks of this re|ceiving, or coming <HI>to,</HI> or joyning <HI>with</HI> Chri&s;t, as the Ground of an Intere&s;t in his Benefits: To as many as received him, <HI>to them gave he Power</HI> to become the Sons of God. Ye will not come unto me <HI>that ye might have Life,</HI> And there is a wide Difference between its being look|ed on &s;uitable that Chri&s;t's Satisfaction and Merits &s;hould be theirs that believe, becau&s;e an Intere&s;t in that Satis|faction and Merit is but a fit Reward of Faith, or a &s;ui|table Te&s;timony of God's Re&s;pect to the Amiablene&s;s and Excellency of that Grace, and it's only being look|ed on &s;uitable that Chri&s;t's Satisfaction and Merits &s;hould be theirs, becau&s;e Chri&s;t and they are &s;o united, that in the Eyes of the Judge they may &s;uitably be look|ed upon, and taken, as one.</P>
<P>Altho', on the Account of Faith in the Believer, it is, in the Sight of God, fit and congruous, both that he that believes &s;hould be looked upon as in Chri&s;t, and al&s;o as having an Intere&s;t in his Merits, in the way that has been now explain'd, yet it appears that this is very wide from a <HI>merit of Congruity,</HI> or indeed <HI>any moral Congruity at all</HI> to either. There is a twofold Fitne&s;s to a State; I know not how to give them di&s;tingui&s;hing Names o|therwi&s;e than by calling the one a <HI>moral,</HI> and the other a <HI>natural</HI> Fitne&s;s: A Per&s;on has a <HI>moral</HI> Fitne&s;s for a State, when his moral Excellency commends him to it, or when his being put into &s;uch a good State, is but a <HI>fit</HI> or &s;ui|table
<PB N="18" REF="004239_0025_10042B316E735B80">
Te&s;timony of Regard or Love to the <HI>moral Excel|lency,</HI> or Value, or Amiablene&s;s of any of his Qualifica|tions or Acts. A Per&s;on has a <HI>natural</HI> Fitne&s;s for a State when it appears meet and condecent that he &s;hould be in &s;uch a State or Circum&s;tances, only from the natural con|cord or agreablene&s;s there is between &s;uch Qualificati|ons and &s;uch Circum&s;tances; not becau&s;e the Qualifi|cations are lovely or unlovely, but only becau&s;e the Qualifications, and the Circum&s;tances are like one another, or do in their nature &s;uit and agree or unite one to ano|ther. And 'tis on this latter Account only that God looks on it fit by a <HI>natural Fitne&s;s,</HI> that he who&s;e Heart &s;incerely <HI>unites</HI> it &s;elf to Chri&s;t as his Saviour, &s;hould be looked upon as <HI>united</HI> to that Saviour, and &s;o having an Intere&s;t in him; and not from any moral Fitne&s;s there is between the excellency of &s;uch a Qualification as Faith, and &s;uch a glorious Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s as the having an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. God's be&s;towing Chri&s;t and his Benefits on a Soul in con&s;equence of Faith, out of Regard only to the natural Concord there is between &s;uch a Qualification of a Soul, and &s;uch an union with Chri&s;t, and Intere&s;t in him, makes the Ca&s;e very widely different from what would be; if he be&s;towed this from regard to any moral Suitablene&s;s; for in the <HI>former</HI> Ca&s;e, 'tis only from God's Love of <HI>order</HI> that he be&s;tows the&s;e Things on the account of Faith. In the <HI>latter</HI> God doth it out of Love to the <HI>Grace of Faith it &s;elf.</HI> God will neither look on Chri&s;t's Merits as ours, nor adjudge his Bene|fits to us, till we be <HI>in Chri&s;t:</HI> nor will he look upon us as being <HI>in him,</HI> without an active unition of our Hearts and Souls to him; becau&s;e he is a wi&s;e Being, and delights in Order, and not in Confu&s;ion, and that Things &s;hould be together or a&s;under according to their nature; and his making &s;uch a Con&s;titution is a te&s;timo|ny of his love of Order: whereas if it were out of re|gard to any moral Fitne&s;s or &s;uitablene&s;s between Faith and &s;uch Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, it would be a Te&s;timony of his Love to the Act or Qualification it &s;elf: The one &s;up|po&s;es this divine Con&s;titution to be a Manife&s;tation of God's regard to the Beauty of the act of Faith, the o|ther
<PB N="19" REF="004239_0026_10042B32F5F771E8">
only &s;uppo&s;es it to be a Manife&s;tation of his regard to the Beauty of that Order that there is in uniting tho&s;e Things that have a natural Agreement, and con|gruity, and unition the one with the other. Indeed a mo|ral Suitablene&s;s or Fitne&s;s to a State includes a natural; for 'tis never &s;o that if there be a moral Suitablene&s;s that a Per&s;on &s;hould be in &s;uch a State, but that there is al&s;o a natural Suitablene&s;s; but &s;uch a natural Suitablene&s;s as I have de&s;cribed, by no means nece&s;&s;arily includes a moral.</P>
<P>This is plainly what our Divines intend when they &s;ay that Faith don't ju&s;tify as a <HI>Work,</HI> or a <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s, viz.</HI> That it don't ju&s;tify as a Part of our moral Goodne&s;s or Excellency, or that it don't ju&s;tify as a Work, in the Sen&s;e that Man was to have been ju&s;tified by his Works by the <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> which was to have a Title to eternal Life, given him of God in Te&s;timony of his plea&s;|edne&s;s with his Works, or his regard to the inherent Excellency and Beauty of his Obedience. And this is certainly what the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> means, when he &s;o much in&s;i&s;ts upon it that we are not ju&s;tified by <HI>works, viz. </HI> that we are not ju&s;tified by them as <HI>good Works,</HI> or by any <HI>good|ne&s;s, value,</HI> or <HI>excellency of our Works.</HI> For the proof of this I &s;hall at pre&s;ent mention but one Thing, (being like to have occa&s;ion to &s;ay what &s;hall make it more a|bundantly manife&s;t afterwards,) and that is, the Apo&s;|tles, from Time to Time, &s;peaking of our not being ju&s;|tified by <HI>Works,</HI> as the Thing that excludes all <HI>boa&s;ting, Eph.</HI> 2 9. <HI>Rom</HI> 3. 27. and Chap. 4. 2. now which way do Works give occa&s;ion for boa&s;ting, but as <HI>good?</HI> What do Men u&s;e to boa&s;t of, but of &s;omething they &s;uppo&s;e <HI>good</HI> or <HI>excellent?</HI> And on what Account do they boa&s;t of any Thing, but for the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Excellency</HI> that is in it?</P>
<P>From the&s;e Things we may learn in what manner Faith is the only Condition of Ju&s;tification and Salvati|on; for tho' it be not the only Condition, &s;o as alone tru|ly to have the Place of a Condition in an hypothetical Propo&s;ition, in which Ju&s;tification and Salvation are the <HI>Con&s;equent,</HI> yet it is the Condition of Ju&s;tification in a
<PB N="20" REF="004239_0027_10042B3489782DD8">
Manner peculiar to it, and &s;o that nothing el&s;e has a parallel Influence with it; becau&s;e Faith includes the whole Act of Unition to Chri&s;t as a Saviour: The en|tire active uniting of the Soul, or the whole of what is called <HI>coming to</HI> Chri&s;t, and <HI>receiving</HI> of him, is called Faith in Scripture; and however other Things may be no le&s;s excellent than Faith, yet 'tis not the nature of any o|ther Graces or Vertues directly to clo&s;e with Chri&s;t as a Me|diator, any further than they enter into the Con&s;titution of ju&s;tifying Faith, and do belong to its Nature.</P>
<P>Thus I have explained my meaning, in a&s;&s;erting it as a Doctrine of the Go&s;pel, that we are ju&s;tified by Faith only, without any manner of Goodne&s;s of our own.</P>
<P>I now proceed in the</P>
<P>II. Place, <HI>to the Proof of it,</HI> which I &s;hall endea|vour to produce in the following Arguments,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t Such is <HI>our Ca&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>State of Things,</HI> that neither Faith, nor any other Qualification, or Act, or Cour&s;e of Acts <HI>does,</HI> or can render it <HI>&s;uitable</HI> or <HI>fit</HI> that Per&s;on &s;hould have an Intere&s;t in the Saviour, and &s;o a Title to his Benefits, on Account of any excellency therein, or any other way than only as &s;omething in him may unite him to the Saviour. It is not <HI>&s;uitable</HI> that God &s;hould give fallen Man an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t and his Me|rits, as a Te&s;timony of his re&s;pect to any Thing what|&s;oever as a loveline&s;s in him; and that becau&s;e 'tis not meet till a Sinner is actually ju&s;tified, that any Thing in him &s;hould be accepted of God, as any excellency or a|miablene&s;s of his Per&s;on; or that God by any Act, &s;hould in any manner or degree te&s;tify any plea&s;edne&s;s with him, or favour towards him, on the account of any Thing inherent in him; and that for two Rea&s;ons, 1. Becau&s;e the nature of Things will not admit of it. 2. Becau&s;e an antecedent divine Con&s;titution &s;tands in the way of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Nature of Things will not admit of it. And this appears from the infinite Guilt that the Sinner 'till ju&s;tified is under; which ari&s;es from the infinite evil or heinou&s;ne&s;s of Sin. But becau&s;e this is what &s;ome deny, I would therefore <HI>fir&s;t</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h that Point, and &s;hew that
<PB N="21" REF="004239_0028_10042B3D15D7DF88">
Sin is a Thing that is indeed properly of infinite Hei|nou&s;ne&s;s; and <HI>then</HI> &s;hew the Con&s;equence, and &s;hew that it being &s;o, and &s;o the Sinner under infinite Guilt in God's Sight, it cannot be &s;uitable, 'till the Sinner is ac|tually ju&s;tified, that God &s;hould by any Act te&s;tify any plea&s;edne&s;s <HI>with,</HI> or acceptance <HI>of,</HI> any Thing as any ex|cellency or amiablene&s;s of his Per&s;on, or indeed <HI>have</HI> any acceptance <HI>of</HI> him, or plea&s;edne&s;s <HI>with</HI> him <HI>to te&s;tify.</HI></P>
<P>That the evil and demerit of Sin is infinitely great, is mo&s;t demon&s;trably evident, becau&s;e what the evil or iniquity of Sin con&s;i&s;ts in, is the violating of an Obliga|tion, the doing contrary to what we are obliged to do, or doing what we &s;hould not do; and therefore by how much the greater the Obligation is that is violated, by &s;o much the greater is the Iniquity of the violation. But certainly our Obligation to love or honour any Be|ing is great in proportion to the greatne&s;s or excellency of that Being, or his worthine&s;s to be loved and honour|ed: we are under greater Obligations to love a more lovely Being than a le&s;s lovely; and if a Being be <HI>infinitely excellent</HI> and lovely, our Obligations to love him are therein <HI>infinitely great:</HI> The matter is &s;o plain it &s;eems needle&s;s to &s;ay much about it.</P>
<P>Some have argued exceeding &s;trangely again&s;t the infi|nite evil of Sin, from its being committed again&s;t an in|finite Object, that if &s;o, then it may as well be argued that there is al&s;o an infinite value or worthine&s;s in Holi|ne&s;s and Love to God, becau&s;e that al&s;o has an infinite Object; Whereas the Argument from parity of Rea&s;on will carry it in the <HI>rever&s;e:</HI> the Sin of the Creature <HI>a|gain&s;t God is ill de&s;erving</HI> in proportion to the di&s;tance there is between<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> God and the Creature, the <HI>great|ne&s;s of the Object,</HI> and the <HI>meanne&s;s of the Subject</HI> aggra|vates it; but 'tis the rever&s;e with regard to the <HI>worthi|ne&s;s</HI> of the re&s;pect of the Creature to God. <HI>'tis worthle&s;s</HI> (and not <HI>worthy</HI>) in proportion to the <HI>meanne&s;s of the Subject:</HI> &s;o much the greater the Di&s;tance between God and the Creature, &s;o much the le&s;s is the Creature's re|&s;pect worthy of God's notice or regard. The <HI>unwor|thine&s;s</HI> of Sin or oppo&s;ition to God ri&s;es, and is great in
<PB N="22" REF="004239_0029_10042B3E9D83F820">
proportion to the <HI>dignity</HI> of the <HI>Object,</HI> &amp; <HI>inferiority</HI> of the <HI>Subject;</HI> but on the contrary the <HI>worth</HI> or <HI>value</HI> of re|&s;pect ri&s;es in proportion to the <HI>value</HI> of the <HI>Subject;</HI> and that for this plain Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>evil</HI> of <HI>di&s;re&s;pect</HI> is in proportion to the Obligation that lies upon the <HI>Sub|ject</HI> to the <HI>Object;</HI> which Obligation is mo&s;t evidently encrea&s;ed by the excellency and &s;uperiority of the <HI>Ob|ject;</HI> but on the contrary the <HI>worthine&s;s</HI> of <HI>re&s;pect</HI> to a Being is in proportion to the Obligation that lies on him who is the <HI>Object,</HI> (or rather the Rea&s;on he has) to re|gard the <HI>Subject,</HI> which certainly is in proportion to the Subject's value or excellency. Sin or <HI>di&s;re&s;pect</HI> is evil or heinous in proportion to the Degree of what it denies in the <HI>Object,</HI> and as it were <HI>takes from it, viz.</HI> its ex|cellency and <HI>worthine&s;s of re&s;pect;</HI> On the contrary, re&s;pect is valuable in proportion to the value of what is <HI>given to the Object</HI> in that re&s;pect, which undoubtedly, (other Things being equal,) is great in proportion to the Subject's value, or worthine&s;s of regard; becau&s;e the Subject in giving his Re&s;pect, can give no more than him&s;elf; &s;o far as he gives his re&s;pect he gives him&s;elf to the Object; and therefore <HI>his gift</HI> is of greater or le&s;&s;er value in proportion to the value <HI>of him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Hence (by the way,) the Love, Honour, and Obedi|ence of Chri&s;t towards God, has infinite Value, from the excellency and dignity of the Per&s;on in whom the&s;e Qualifications were inherent: and the Rea&s;on why we needed a Per&s;on of infinite Dignity to obey for us, was becau&s;e of our infinite comparative Meanne&s;s, who had di&s;obeyed, whereby our Di&s;obedience was infinitely ag|gravated: We needed one, the worthine&s;s of who&s;e O|bedience, might be an&s;werable to the unworthine&s;s of our Di&s;obedience; and therefore needed one who was as great and worthy, as we were unworthy.</P>
<P>Another Objection (that perhaps may be thought hardly worth mentioning.) is, that to &s;uppo&s;e Sin to be in|finitely heinous is to make all Sins equally heinous; for how can any Sin be more than infinitely heinous? But all that can be argued hence is, that no Sin can be greater with re&s;pect <HI>to that aggravation</HI> the worthine&s;s of the
<PB N="23" REF="004239_0030_10042B406F8690A0">
Object again&s;t whom it is committed: one Sin can't be more aggravated than another <HI>in that re&s;pect,</HI> becau&s;e in this re&s;pect the aggravation of every Sin is infinite; but that don't hinder but that &s;ome Sins may be more hei|nous than others <HI>in other re&s;pects:</HI> as if we &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e a <HI>Cylinder</HI> infinitely long, it can't be greater in that re&s;pect, <HI>viz.</HI> with re&s;pect to the length of it; but yet it may be doubled, and trebled, and made a thou&s;and fold more, by the increa&s;e of other Dimen&s;ions. Of Sins that are all infinitely heinous, &s;ome may be more hei|nous than others, as well as of divers Puni&s;hments that are all infinitely dreadful Calamities, or all of them infinite|ly exceeding all finite Calamities, &s;o that there is no finite Calamity however great but what is infinitely le&s;s dreadful, or more eligable than any of them, yet &s;ome of them may be a thou&s;and Times more dreadful than others. A Puni&s;hment may be infinitely dreadful by rea&s;on of the infinite Duration of it; and therefore can't be greater with re&s;pect to that Aggravation of it, <HI>viz.</HI> its length of continuance; but yet may be va&s;tly more terrible on other Accounts.</P>
<P>Having thus, as I imagine, made it clear that all Sin is infinitely heinous, and con&s;equently that the Sinner, before he is ju&s;tified, is under infinite Guilt in God's Sight, it now remains that I &s;hew the <HI>Con&s;equence,</HI> or how it follows from hence, that it is not &s;uitable that God &s;hould give the Sinner an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t's Me|rits, and &s;o a title to his Benefits, from regard to any Qualification, or Act, or cour&s;e of Acts, in him, on the Account of any Excellency or Goodne&s;s what&s;oever therein, but only as uniting to Chri&s;t; or (which fully implies it) that it is not &s;uitable that God by any Act, &s;hould in any Manner or Degree, te&s;tify any acceptance <HI>of,</HI> or plea&s;edne&s;s <HI>with</HI> any Thing, as any Vertue, or Excellency, or any part of loveline&s;s, or valuablene&s;s, in his Per&s;on, until he is actually <HI>already</HI> intere&s;ted in Chri&s;t's Merits; which appears by this, that from the <HI>Premi&s;&s;es</HI> it follows, that before the Sinner is already intere&s;ted in Chri&s;t, &amp; ju&s;tified, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible God &s;hould <HI>have</HI> any acceptance of, or plea&s;edne&s;s with the Per&s;on

<P N="2">2 A divine Con&s;titution that is antecedent to that which e&s;tabli&s;hes Ju&s;tification by a Saviour, (and indeed to any need of a Saviour,) &s;tands in the Way of it, <HI>viz.</HI> that original Con&s;titution or Law which Man was put under; by which Con&s;titution or Law the Sinner is condemned, becau&s;e he is a violater of that Law; and &s;tands condemned, till he has actually an Intere&s;t in

<P>I know that the An&s;wer that will be ready for this is, that we now are not &s;ubject to that Con&s;titution that Mankind were at fir&s;t put under; but that God in Mer|cy to Mankind has aboli&s;hed that rigorous Con&s;titution or Law that they were under originally, &amp; has put us un|der a new Law, and introduced a more mild Con&s;tituti|on; And that the Con&s;titution or Law it &s;elf not re|maining, there is no need of &s;uppo&s;ing that the Condem|nation of it remains, to &s;tand in the Way of the Accep|tance of our Vertue.

<P>Thus far I have argued principally from <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and <HI>the Nature of Things:</HI> I proceed now to the</P>
<P>Second <HI>Argument,</HI> which is, That this is a Doctrine that the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> the Revelation that God has given us of his Mind and Will, by which alone we can never come to know how tho&s;e that have offended God can come to be accepted of him, and ju&s;tified in his Sight, is exceeding full in: Particularly the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> is abundant in teaching that <HI>we are ju&s;tified by Faith alone without the Works of the Law:</HI> There is no one Doctrine that he in&s;i&s;ts &s;o much upon, and is &s;o particular in, and that he handles with &s;o much di&s;tinctne&s;s, explaining, and giving Rea&s;ons, and an&s;wering Objections.</P>
<P>Here it is not denied by any, that the Apo&s;tle does a&s;&s;ert that we are ju&s;tified by Faith, without the Works of the Law, becau&s;e the Words are expre&s;s; but only it is &s;aid that we take his Words wrong, and under&s;tand that by 'em that never entered into his Heart, in that when he excludes the Works of the Law, we under&s;tand him of the whole Law of God, or the Rule which he has given to Mankind to walk by; whereas all that he intends is the <HI>ceremonial</HI> Law.</P>
<P>Some that oppo&s;e this Doctrine indeed &s;ay, that the
<PB N="29" REF="004239_0036_10042B53138CA380">
Apo&s;tle &s;ometimes means that it is by Faith, <HI>i. e.</HI> an hearty embracing the Go&s;pel in its fir&s;t Act, <HI>only,</HI> or <HI>without any preceeding holy Life,</HI> that Per&s;ons are admitted into a ju&s;tified State; but, &s;ay they, 'tis by a per&s;evering Obe|dience that they are continued in a ju&s;tified State, and it is by this that they are finally ju&s;tified. But this is the &s;ame Thing as to &s;ay that a Man on his fir&s;t embracing the Go&s;pel is <HI>conditionally</HI> ju&s;tified and pardon'd.&mdash;To pardon Sin, is to free the Sinner from the Puni&s;h|ment of it, or from that eternal Mi&s;ery that is due to it; And therefore if a Per&s;on is pardon'd, or freed from this Mi&s;ery, on his fir&s;t embracing the Go&s;pel, and yet not finally freed, but his actual freedom &s;till depends on &s;ome Condition yet to be performed, 'tis inconceivable how he can be pardon'd otherwi&s;e than conditionally: <HI>that is</HI> he is not properly <HI>actually pardon'd,</HI> and freed from Puni&s;hment, but only he has God's Promi&s;e that he &s;hall be pardon'd <HI>on future Conditions;</HI> God promi&s;es him that now, if he per&s;everes in Obedience, he &s;hall be finally pardon'd, or actually freed from Hell; which is to make ju&s;t nothing at all of the Apo&s;tle's great Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone: &s;uch a condi|tional Pardon is no Pardon or Ju&s;tification at all, any more than all Mankind have, whether they embrace the Go&s;pel or no; for they all have a promi&s;e of final Ju&s;ti|fication on Conditions of future &s;incere Obedience, as much as he that embraces the Go&s;pel.&mdash;But not to di&s;pute about this, we will &s;uppo&s;e that there may be &s;omething or other at the Sinner's <HI>fir&s;t embracing the Go&s;pel,</HI> that may properly be called Ju&s;tification or Par|don, and yet that final Ju&s;tification, or real freedom from the Puni&s;hment of Sin, is &s;till &s;u&s;pended on Conditions hitherto unfulfill'd; yet they that hold that Sinners are thus ju&s;tified on embracing the Go&s;pel, they &s;uppo&s;e that they are ju&s;tified by this, no otherwi&s;e than as this is a <HI>leading act of Obedience,</HI> or at lea&s;t as Vertue and moral Goodne&s;s in them, and therefore would be excluded by the Apo&s;tle as much as any other Vertue or Obedi|ence; if it be allowed that he means the moral Law, when he excludes <HI>Works of the Law.</HI> And therefore if
<PB N="26" REF="004239_0037_10042B562CD3E808">
that Point be yielded that the Apo&s;tle means the <HI>moral,</HI> and not only the <HI>ceremonial</HI> Law, their whole Scheme falls to the Ground.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the i&s;&s;ue of the whole Argument from tho&s;e Texts in St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Epi&s;tles depends on the de|termination of this Point, I would be particular in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Some of our Opponents in this Doctrine of Ju&s;tificati|on, when they deny that by the Law, the Apo&s;tle means the moral Law, or the whole Rule of Life which God has given to Mankind, &s;eem to choo&s;e to expre&s;s them|&s;elves thus, that the Apo&s;tle only intends the <HI>Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation:</HI> But this comes to ju&s;t the &s;ame Thing as if they &s;aid that the Apo&s;tle only means to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">lude the Works of the Ceremonial Law; for when they &s;ay that 'tis intended only that we ben't ju&s;tified by the Works of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, if they mean any Thing by it, it mu&s;t be that we ben't ju&s;tified by attending, and ob&s;erving what is <HI>Mo&s;aic in that Di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> or by what was peculiar to it, and wherein it differed from the <HI>Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation;</HI> which is the &s;ame as that which is ceremonial and po&s;itive, and not moral, <HI>in that Ad|mini&s;tration</HI>&mdash;. So that this is what I have to di&s;prove, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Apo&s;tle when he &s;peaks of Works of the Law in this Affair, means only Works of the Ceremoni|al Law, or tho&s;e Ob&s;ervances that were peculiar to the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>And here it mu&s;t be noted, that no Body controverts it with them, whether the Works of the Ceremonial Law ben't included or whether the Apo&s;tle don't par|ticularly argue again&s;t Ju&s;tification by Circumci&s;ion, and other ceremonial Ob&s;ervances; but all that is in Que&s;|tion is, whether when he denies Ju&s;tification by Works of the Law, he is to be under&s;tood only of the Ceremo|nial Law, or whether the moral Law ben't al&s;o implied and intended; And therefore tho&s;e Arguments that are brought to prove that the Apo&s;tle meant the Ceremoni|al Law are nothing to the Purpo&s;e, unle&s;s they prove more than that, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Apo&s;tle meant <HI>tho&s;e only.</HI></P>

What is much in&s;i&s;ted on is, that it was the <HI>judai&s;ing</HI> Chri&s;tians being &s;o fond of Circumci&s;ion, and other Cere|monies of the Law, and depending &s;o much on them, which was the very Occa&s;ion of the Apo&s;tles writing as he does again&s;t Ju&s;tification by the Works of the Law.

Where is the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing that the Apo&s;tle might take occa&s;ion from his ob&s;erving &s;ome to tru&s;t in a <HI>certain</HI> Work as a Work of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o write to them again&s;t Per&s;ons tru&s;ting in <HI>any</HI> Work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>at all,</HI> and that it was a very proper Occa&s;ion too? yea it would have been anavoid|able for the Apo&s;tle to have argued again&s;t tru&s;ting in a particular Work in that quality of a Work of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, which quality was general, but he mu&s;t there in argue again&s;t tru&s;ting in Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>in gene|ral</HI> Suppo&s;ing it had been &s;ome other particular &s;ort of Works that was the occa&s;ion of the Apo&s;tle's writing, as for in&s;tance, Works of Charity, and the Apo&s;tle &s;hould hence take occa&s;ion to write to them not to tru&s;t in their Works, could the Apo&s;tle by that be under|&s;tood of no other Works be&s;ides Works of Charity?

<P>Another Thing that is alledged as an Evidence that the Apo&s;tle means the ceremonial Law, when he &s;ays we can not be ju&s;tified by the Works of the Law, is that he u&s;es that Argument to prove it, <HI>viz.</HI> that this Law that he &s;peaks of was given &s;o long after the Covenant with <HI>Abraham,</HI> in Gal 3&punc; 17. <HI>And this I &s;ay that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chri&s;t, the

Law that was four hundred and thirty years after can|not di&s;annul.</HI> But &s;ay they, it was only the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Ad|mini&s;tration, and not the Covenant of Works that was given &s;o long after.&mdash;But the Apo&s;tle's Argument &s;eems manife&s;tly to be mi&s;taken by them. The Apo&s;tle don't &s;peak of a Law that began fir&s;t <HI>to have being</HI> four hundred and thirty Years after; if he did, there would be &s;ome force in their Objection; But he has re&s;pect to a certain &s;olemn Tran&s;action, well known among the <HI>Jews,</HI> by the Phra&s;e of <HI>the giving of the Law,</HI> which was that great Tran&s;action at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> that we have Account of in the 19, and 20 Chapters of <HI>Exodus,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting e&s;pecially in God's giving the ten Command|ments, which is the moral Law, with that terrible Voice, which Law he afterwards gave in Tables of Stone. This Tran&s;action the <HI>Jews</HI> in the Apo&s;tles Time mi&s;interpre|ted, they looked upon it as God's e&s;tabli&s;hing that Law as a Rule of Ju&s;tification. This conceit of theirs the Apo&s;tle brings this invincible Argument again&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> That God would never go about to <HI>di&s;annul</HI> his Cove|nant with <HI>Abraham,</HI> which was plainly a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> by a Tran&s;action with his Po&s;terity, that was &s;o long after it, and was plainly built upon it: He would not overthrow a <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> that he had long before e&s;tabli&s;hed with <HI>Abraham,</HI> for him, and his Seed, (which is often mention'd as the Ground of God's making them his People,) by now e&s;tabli&s;hing a <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> with them at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> as the Jews and judaizing Chri&s;tians &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But that the Apo&s;tle don't mean only Works of the ceremonial Law, when he excludes Works of the Law in Ju&s;tification, but al&s;o of the moral Law, and all Works of Obedience, Vertue, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s what|&s;oever, may appear by the following Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Apo&s;tle don't only &s;ay, that we are not ju&s;ti|fied by the Works <HI>of the Law,</HI> but that we are not ju&s;|tified <HI>by Works,</HI> u&s;ing a general Term; as in our Text it is &s;aid, unto him that <HI>worketh not,</HI> but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth, &amp;c. and in the 6. v. <HI>God imputeth righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> without Works, And Chap 11. 6. <HI>"And

if by Grace, then it is no more of</HI> Works, <HI>otherwi&s;e Grace is no more Grace: But if it be of</HI> Works, <HI>then it is no more Grace; otherwi&s;e Grace is no more Grace.

By which, there is no Rea&s;on in the World to under&s;tand the Apo&s;tle of any other than Works in general, as correlates of a Reward, or good Works, or Works of Vertue and Righteou&s;ne&s;s.

Are not Ob&s;er|vances of other Divine Laws Works, as well as of that? It &s;eems to be allowed by the Divines in the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, in their Interpretation of &s;everal of tho&s;e Texts where the Apo&s;tle only mentions <HI>Works,</HI> without any Addition, that he means our own good Works in gene|ral; but then they &s;ay, he only means to exclude any proper merit in tho&s;e Works. But to &s;ay the Apo&s;tle means one Thing when he &s;ays we ben't ju&s;tified by <HI>Works,</HI> another when he &s;ays we ben't ju&s;tified by the <HI>Works of the Law,</HI> when we find the Expre&s;&s;ions mixed. and u&s;ed in the &s;ame Di&s;cour&s;e, and when the Apo&s;tle is evidently upon the &s;ame Argument, is very unrea&s;onable, it is to dodge, and fly from Scripture, rather than to open and yield our &s;elves to it's teachings.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the third Chapter of <HI>Romans,</HI> our having been guilty of Breaches of the moral Law, is an Argument that the Apo&s;tle u&s;es why we cannot be ju&s;tified <HI>by the Works of the Law;</HI> Beginning with the 9th <HI>v</HI> There he proves out of the Old Te&s;tament, that all are under Sin; <HI>There is none righteous, no not one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.

Therefore</HI> none at all can be ju&s;tified by the Deeds of the Law: Now if the Apo&s;tle meant only that we are not ju&s;tified by the Deeds of the ceremonial Law, what kind of arguing would that be, <HI>Their Mouth is full of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> cur&s;ing and bitterne&s;s, their Feet are &s;wift to &s;hed Blood, therefore,</HI> They can't be ju&s;tified by the Deeds of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Admini&s;tration&punc; They are guilty of the Breaches of the moral Law, and there|fore they can't be ju&s;tified by the Deeds of the ceremonial Law?

<P>And it may be noted, that the Apo&s;tle's Argu|ment here is the &s;ame that I have already u&s;ed. <HI>viz.</HI> That as we are in our &s;elves, and out of Chri&s;t, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> under the Condemnation of that original Law, or Con&s;titution that God e&s;tabli&s;hed with Mankind; and therefore 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Way fit that any Thing that we do, any Vertue or Obedience of ours, &s;hould be ac|cepted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> accepted on the Account of it.</P>

4. 'Tis evident that when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, we can't be ju&s;tified by the Works of the Law, he means the Moral as well as ceremonial Law, by his giving this Rea&s;on for it, that <HI>by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin,</HI> as <HI>Rom</HI> 3. 20. <HI>By the Deeds of the Law &s;hall no Fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his Sight, for by the Law is the knowledge of Sin.</HI> Now that Law by which we come to the knowledge of Sin, is the moral Law chiefly and prima|rily.&mdash;If this Argument of the Apo&s;tle be good, <HI>that we can't be ju&s;tified by the Deeds of the Law, becau&s;e it is by the Law that we come to the knowledge of Sin,</HI> then it proves that we can't be ju&s;tified by the Deeds of the Moral Law, nor by the Precepts of Chri&s;tianity; for by them is the Knowledge of Sin. If the Rea&s;on be good, then where the Rea&s;on holds, the Truth holds.&mdash;'Tis a mi&s;erable Shift, and a violent Force put upon the Words, to &s;ay that the meaning is, that by the Law of Circumci&s;ion is the Knowledge of Sin, becau&s;e Cir|cumci&s;ion &s;ignifying the taking away of Sin, puts Men in mind of Sin. The plain meaning of the Apo&s;tle is, that as the Law mo&s;t &s;trictly forbids Sin, it tends to convince us of Sin, and bring our own Con&s;ciences to <HI>condemn</HI> us, in&s;tead of <HI>ju&s;tifying</HI> of us; that the U&s;e of it is to declare to us our own Guilt and Unworthine&s;s, which is the rever&s;e of ju&s;tifying and approving of us as virtuous or worthy. This is the Apo&s;tle's meaning, if we will allow him to be his own expo&s;itor; for he him&s;elf in this very Epi&s;tle explains to us how it is that by the Law we have the Knowledge of Sin, and that 'tis by the Law's forbidding Sin <HI>Chap.</HI> 7. 7. <HI>I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> known Sin, but by the Law, for I had not known Lu&s;t, except the Law had &s;aid, thou &s;halt not covet.</HI> There the Apo&s;tle determines two Things, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Way in which, <HI>by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by the Law's forbidding Sin: And <HI>Secondly,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more directly &s;till to the Purpo&s;e; he determines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">at 'tis the Moral Law by which we come to the knowledge of Sin; for &s;ays he, <HI>I had not known Lu&s;t except the Law had &s;aid, thou &s;halt not covet:</HI> Now 'tis the moral, and not the ceremonial Law, that &s;ays thou
<PB N="37" REF="004239_0044_10042B6CAE05B530">
&s;halt not covet: Therefore when the Apo&s;tle argues that by the Deeds of the Law no Fle&s;h living &s;hall be ju&s;tifyed, becau&s;e by the Law is the knowledge of Sin, his Argument proves, (unle&s;s he was mi&s;taken as to the force of his Argument,) that we can't be ju&s;tifyed by the Deeds of the Moral Law.</P>
<P N="5">5. 'Tis evident that the Apo&s;tle don't mean only the ceremonial Law, becau&s;e he gives this Rea&s;on why we have Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and a Title to the Privilege of God's Children, not by the Law, but by Faith, <HI>that the Law worketh Wrath, Rom.</HI> 4. 13, 14, 15, 16. <HI>For the promi&s;e that he &s;hould be the Heir of the World, was not to</HI> Abraham, <HI>or to his Seed</HI> through the Law, <HI>but through the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith: For if they which are</HI> of the Law <HI>be Heirs,</HI> Faith <HI>is made void, and the promi&s;e made of none effect:</HI> Becau&s;e the Law worketh Wrath; <HI>for where no Law is there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> Therefore it is of Faith <HI>that it might be by Grace.</HI> Now the way in which the Law works Wrath, by the Apo&s;|tles own Account, in the Rea&s;on he him&s;elf annexes, is by forbidding Sin, and aggravating the Guilt of the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; <HI>for,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>where no Law is there is Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion:</HI> And &s;o, Chap 7 13. <HI>That Sin by the Commandment might become exceeding &s;inful.</HI>&mdash;If there|fore this Rea&s;on of the Apo&s;tle be good, it is much &s;tronger again&s;t Ju&s;tification by the moral Law, than the ceremonial Law; for 'tis by Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> moral Law chiefly that there comes Wrath; for they are mo&s;t &s;trictly forbidden, and mo&s;t terribly threaten'd.</P>

<P>'Tis &s;everal Ways manife&s;t that the Apo&s;tle in this Text, by <HI>Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done,</HI> don't mean only Works of the ceremonial Law. It appears by the 3d v. <HI>For we our &s;elves al&s;o were &s;ome|times fooli&s;h, di&s;obedient, deceived, &s;erving divers Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures, living in Malice and Envy, hateful, and ha|ting one another.</HI> The&s;e are Breaches of the <HI>moral</HI> Law, that the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves they lived in before they were ju&s;tifyed: and 'tis mo&s;t plain that 'tis this that gives Occa&s;ion to the Apo&s;tle to ob&s;erve as he does in the 5 ver. That it was not by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which they had done, that they were &s;aved or ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>But we need not go to the Context, 'tis mo&s;t ap|parent from the Words them&s;elves, that the Apo&s;tle don't mean only Works of the ceremonial Law: If he had only &s;aid, it is not by our own Works of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s; what could we under&s;tand by <HI>Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> but only <HI>Righteous Works,</HI> or which is the &s;ame Thing, <HI>good Works?</HI> And to &s;ay that <HI>it is by our own righteous Works, that we are ju&s;tified, tho' not by one particular kind of righteous Works,</HI> would certainly be a Contradiction to &s;uch an A&s;&s;ertion. But the Words are render'd yet more &s;trong, plain, and determined in their Sen&s;e, by tho&s;e additional Words, <HI>which we have done;</HI> which &s;hews that the Apo&s;tle intends to exclude all <HI>our own righteous or vertuous Works</HI> univer&s;ally. If it &s;hould be a&s;&s;erted concerning any Commodity, Trea&s;ure, or precious Jewel, that it could not be procured <HI>by Money,</HI> and not only &s;o, but to make the A&s;&s;ertion the more &s;trong, it &s;hould be a&s;&s;erted with additional Words, that it could not be procured by Money <HI>that Men po&s;&s;e&s;s;</HI> how unrea&s;onable would it be after all to &s;ay, that all that was meant was, that it could not be procured <HI>with Bra&s;s Money?</HI></P>
<P>And what renders the interpreting this Text of Works of the ceremonial Law, yet more unrea&s;onable is, that the&s;e Works were indeed <HI>no Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s at all,</HI> but were only fal&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o by the

<P>But then further, if we &s;hould allow that the Apo&s;tle intends only to oppo&s;e Ju&s;tification by Works of the ceremonial Law in this Text, yet 'tis evident by the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion he u&s;es that he means to oppo&s;e it under that Notion, or in that quality, of their being <HI>Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s of our own doing.</HI> But if the Apo&s;tle argues again&s;t our being ju&s;tified by Works of the cere|monial Law under the Notion of their being <HI>of that Nature and Kind,</HI> viz. <HI>Works of our own doing;</HI> then it will follow that the Apo&s;tle's Argument is &s;trong again&s;t, not only <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> but <HI>all of that Nature and Kind,</HI> even all that <HI>are of our own doing</HI></P>
<P>If there were no other Text in the Bible about Ju&s;tification but this, this would clearly and invincibly prove that we are not ju&s;tified by any of our own Goodne&s;s, Vertue, or Righteou&s;ne&s;s or for the Excel|lency or Righteou&s;ne&s;s of any Thing <HI>that we have done</HI> in Religion; becau&s;e 'tis here &s;o fully and &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted: But this Text does abundantly confirm other Texts of the Apo&s;tle, where he denies Ju&s;tification by Works of the Law: There is no doubt can be ration|ally

'Tis true their Obedience to the ceremonial Law would have nothing to do in the Affair of Ju&s;tificati|on, unle&s;s it was <HI>&s;incere;</HI> and &s;o neither would the Works of the moral Law: Obedience to the moral Law would have been concerned in the Affair of Ju&s;ti|fication, if &s;incere; and &s;o would Obedience to the ceremonial.

<P>But 'tis evident that the Saints under the old Te&s;ta|ment were not ju&s;tified <HI>in any mea&s;ure,</HI> by the Works of the ceremonial Law.

<P>And further, how can the Apo&s;tle's De&s;cription that he here gives from <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> of this <HI>exploded</HI> Way of Ju&s;tification by the Works of the Law, con&s;i&s;t with the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme of a Way of Ju&s;tification by the Vertue of a &s;incere Obedience, that <HI>&s;till remains</HI> as the <HI>true and only Way</HI> of Ju&s;tification, under the Go&s;pel. 'Tis mo&s;t apparent that 'tis the de&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle to give a De&s;cription of both the legal <HI>rejected,</HI> and the evangelical <HI>valid</HI> Ways of Ju&s;tification, in that wherein they differ, or are di&s;tingui&s;hed the one from the other: But how is that, that <HI>he that doth tho&s;e Things &s;hall live in them,</HI> that wherein the Way of Ju&s;tification by the Works of the Law, differs, or is di&s;tingui&s;hed from that in which Chri&s;tians under the Go&s;pel are ju&s;tified, ac|cording to their Scheme; for &s;till, according to them, it may be &s;aid, in the &s;ame Manner, of the <HI>Precepts of the Go&s;pel,</HI> he that doth the&s;e Things &s;hall live in them: The difference lies only in the Things <HI>to be done,</HI> but not at all, in that that the <HI>doing of them</HI> is not the Con|dition of living in them, ju&s;t in the one Ca&s;e, as in the other. The Words, <HI>He that doth them &s;hall live in them,</HI> will &s;erve ju&s;t as well for a De&s;cription of the latter as the former.&mdash;By the Apo&s;tle's &s;aying, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law is de&s;cribed <HI>thus,</HI> he that doth the&s;e Things &s;hall live in them, but the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith, faith <HI>thus,</HI> plainly intimates that the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Faith faith <HI>otherwi&s;e,</HI> and in an <HI>oppo&s;ite man|ner.</HI>&mdash;But be&s;ides, if the&s;e Words cited from <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> are actually &s;aid by him of the moral Law as well as ceremonial, as 'tis mo&s;t evident they are, it renders it &s;till more ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e them mentioned by the A|po&s;tle, as the <HI>very Note of Di&s;tinction</HI> between Ju&s;tifi|cation by a ceremonial Obedience, and a moral &s;incere Obedience, as the <HI>Arminians</HI> mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;poken to a &s;econd Argument, to prove that we are not ju&s;tified by any manner of Virtue or

Goodne&s;s of our own, <HI>viz.</HI> That to &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e is contrary to the Doctrine that is directly urged, and abundantly in&s;i&s;ted on by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in his Epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>I proceed now to a</P>
<P><HI>Third</HI> Argument, <HI>viz</HI> That to &s;uppo&s;e that we are ju&s;tified by our own &s;incere Obedience, or any of our own Virtue or Goodne&s;s, <HI>derogates from Go&s;pel Grace.</HI></P>
<P>That Scheme of Ju&s;tification that manife&s;tly takes from, or dimini&s;hes the Grace of God, is undoubtedly to be rejected; for 'tis the declared De&s;ign of God in the Go&s;pel to exalt the Freedom and Riches of his Grace, in that Method of Ju&s;tification of Sinners, and Way of admitting them to his Favour, and the ble&s;&s;ed Fruits of it, which it declares. The Scripture teaches that the Way of Ju&s;tification that is appointed in the Go&s;pel Covenant, is appointed, <HI>as it is,</HI> for that end, that free Grace might be expre&s;s'd, and glorified; <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 16&punc; <HI>Therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace.</HI> The exerci&s;ing, and magnifying the free Grace of God in the Go&s;pel contrivance for the Ju&s;tification and Salvation of Sinners, is evidently the <HI>chief De&s;ign of it:</HI> And this Freedom and Riches of the Grace of the Go&s;pel is every where &s;poken of in Scripture as the <HI>chief Glory of it.</HI> Therefore that Doctrine that dero|gates from the free Grace of God in ju&s;tifying Sinners, as it is mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to God's De&s;ign, &s;o it mu&s;t be ex|ceeding offen&s;ive to him.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that maintain that we are ju&s;tified by our own &s;incere Obedience, do pretend that their Scheme does not dimini&s;h the Grace of the Go&s;pel; for they &s;ay that the Grace of God is wonderfully manife&s;ted in appointing &s;uch a Way and Method of Salvation, by &s;incere Obedience, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting us to perform &s;uch an O|bedience, and in accepting our imperfect Obedience, in&s;tead of perfect.</P>
<P>Let us therefore examine that Matter, whether their Scheme of a Man's being ju&s;tified by his own Vertue, and &s;incere Obedience, does derogate from the Grace of God or no; or whether free Grace is not mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> exalted,

in &s;uppo&s;ing as we do, that we are ju&s;tified without any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Goodne&s;s of our own. In order to this, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> down this &s;elf evident</P>

<P>And it is not much le&s;s evident, that it doth both <HI>&s;hew a more abundant Benevolence in the Giver</HI> when he &s;hews kindne&s;s without Goodne&s;s or Excellency in the Object, to move him to it; and that it <HI>enhan&s;es the Ob|ligation to gratitude in the Receiver.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It &s;hews a more abundan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> goodne&s;s in the Giver, when he &s;hews kindne&s;s without any Excellency in our Per&s;ons or Actions that &s;hould move the giver to Love and Beneficence. For it certainly &s;hews the more abun|dant and overflowing Goodne&s;s, or Di&s;po&s;ition, to com|municate Good, by how much the le&s;s Loveline&s;s or Excellency there is to entice Beneficence: The <HI>le&s;s</HI> there is in the <HI>receiver</HI> to draw good Will and Kind|ne&s;s, it argues the <HI>more</HI> of the Principle of good Will and Kindne&s;s in the <HI>Giver;</HI> For one that has but a lit|tle of a principle of Love and Benevolence, may be <HI>drawn</HI> to do Good, and to &s;hew Kindne&s;s, when there is a great deal to <HI>draw</HI> him, or when there is much Excellency and Loveline&s;s in the Object to move good Will; when he who&s;e Goodne&s;s and Benevolence is more abundant, will &s;hew Kindne&s;s, where there is le&s;s to draw it forth; for he don't &s;o much need to have it drawn from <HI>without,</HI> he has enough of the principle <HI>within</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> move him, of it &s;elf.

And then does Kindne&s;s and Love appear mo&s;t Triumphant, and wonderfully Great, when the receiver is re&s;pected in the Gift, as not only wholly without all Excellency or Beauty to attract it, but <HI>altogether,</HI> yea <HI>infinitely</HI> vile and hateful.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis apparent al&s;o that it enhan&s;es the Obligation to Gratitude in the Receiver. This is agreeable to the common Sen&s;e of Mankind, that the le&s;s worthy or excellent the Object of Benevolence, or the receiver of Kindne&s;s is, the more he is obliged, and the greater Gratitude is due. He therefore is mo&s;t of all obliged, that receives Kindne&s;s without <HI>any</HI> Goodne&s;s or Ex|cellency in him&s;elf, but with a <HI>total</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al</HI> Hate|fulne&s;s. And as 'tis agreeable to the common Sen&s;e of Mankind; &s;o 'tis agreeable to the Word of God: How often does God in the Scripture in&s;i&s;t on this Argument with Men, to move them to love him, and to acknow|ledge his Kindne&s;s?

<P>Therefore it certainly follows, that that Doctrine that teaches that God, when he ju&s;tifies a Man, and &s;hews him that great Kindne&s;s, as to give him a Right to eter|nal Life, don't do it for any Obedience, or any manner of Goodne&s;s of his; but that Ju&s;tification re&s;pects a Man as ungodly, and wholly without any manner of Vertue, Beauty, or Excellency. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay, this Doctrine does cer|tainly more exalt the free Grace of God in Ju&s;tification, and Man's Obligation to Gratitude to him, for &s;uch a Favour, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n the contrary Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> That God in &s;hewing this Kindne&s;s to Man, re&s;pects him as &s;in|cerely

obedient and vertuous, and as having &s;ome|thing in him that is truly Excellent, and Lovely, and Acceptable in his Sight, and that this Goodne&s;s or Ex|cellency of Man is the very fundamental Condition of the be&s;towment of that Kindne&s;s <HI>on him,</HI> or of the di&s;|tingui&s;hing him from others by that Benefit.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I would <HI>explain what we mean by the Imputati|on of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Sometimes the Expre&s;&s;ion is taken by our Divines in a larger Sen&s;e, for the Im|putation of all that Chri&s;t did and &s;uffered for our Re|demption, whereby we are free from Guilt, and &s;tand Righteous in the &s;ight of God; and &s;o implies the Im|putation both of Chri&s;t's Satisfaction, and Obedience.

<P>The oppo&s;ers of this Doctrine &s;uppo&s;e that there is an ab&s;urdity in it: They &s;ay that to &s;uppo&s;e that God imputes Chri&s;t's Obedience to us, is to &s;uppo&s;e that God is mi&s;taken, and thinks that we perform'd that Obedi|ence that Chri&s;t performed.

Why is there any more ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing that Chri&s;t's Obedience is imputed to us, than that his Satisfaction is imputed?

<HI>Secondly,</HI> To prove that the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is thus imputed.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is the very &s;ame need of Chri&s;t's <HI>obeying the Law in our &s;tead, in order to the Reward,</HI> as of his <HI>&s;uffering the Penalty of the Law, in our &s;tead, in order to our e&s;caping the Penalty;</HI> and the &s;ame Rea&s;on why one &s;hould be accepted on our Account, as the other&punc; There is the &s;ame need of one as the other, <HI>that the Law of God might be an&s;wered:</HI> One was as requi&s;ite to <HI>an&s;wer the Law</HI> as the other, This is certain, that that was the Rea&s;on why there was need that Chri&s;t &s;uffer the Penalty for us, even <HI>that the Law might be an|&s;wered;</HI> for this the Scripture plainly teaches: This is given as the Rea&s;on why Chri&s;t was made a <HI>cur&s;e for us,</HI> that the Law threatned a <HI>cur&s;e to us, Gal.</HI> 3, 10, 13.

<P>Chri&s;t by &s;uffering the Penalty, and &s;o making At|tonement for us, only removes the Guilt of our Sins and &s;o &s;ets us in the &s;ame State that <HI>Adam</HI> was in the fir&s;t Moment of his Creation: And it is no more fit, that we &s;hould obtain eternal Life, only on that Ac|count, than that <HI>Adam</HI> &s;hould have the Reward of eter|nal Life, or of a confirmed and unalterable State of Hap|pine&s;s, the fir&s;t Moment of his exi&s;tence, without any Obedience at all.&mdash; <HI>Adam</HI> was not to have the Reward meerly on the Account of his being innocent; if &s;o, he would have had it fixed upon him at once, as &s;oon

<P>God &s;aw meet to place Man fir&s;t in a State of Trial, and not to give him a Title to eternal Life, as &s;oon as he had made him: becau&s;e it was his will that he &s;hould fir&s;t give Honour to his Authority, by fully &s;ub|mitting to it, in Will and Act, and perfectly obeying his Law.

It therefore became Chri&s;t, &s;eeing that in a&s;&s;uming Man to him&s;elf, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought a Title to this eternal Happine&s;s for him, after he had

broken the Law, that he him&s;elf &s;hould become &s;ub|ject to God's Authority, and be in the Form of a Servant, that he might do that honour to God's Authority for him, by his Obedience, which God at fir&s;t required of Man, as the Condition of his having a Title to that Reward. Chri&s;t came into the World to that end, to render the Honour of God's Authority and Law, con|&s;i&s;tent with the Salvation and eternal Life of Sinners; he came to &s;ave them, and yet withal to a&s;&s;ert and vin|dicate the Honour of the Lawgiver, and his holy Law. Now if the Sinner after his Sin was &s;atisfied for, had eternal Life be&s;towed upon him, without active Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, the Honour of his Law would not be &s;uffici|ently vindicated. Suppo&s;ing this were po&s;&s;ible, that the Sinner him&s;elf could by &s;uffering pay the Debt, and afterwards be in the &s;ame State that he was in before his Probation, that is to &s;ay, <HI>negatively righteous,</HI> or meerly without Guilt; if he now at la&s;t &s;hould have eternal Life be&s;towed upon him, without performing that Condition of Obedience, then God would recede from his Law, and would give the promi&s;ed Reward, and his Law never have Re&s;pect and Honour &s;hewn to it, in that Way of being obeyed&punc; But now Chri&s;t by &s;ubjecting him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Law and obeying of it, has done great Honour to the Law, and to the Autho|rity of God who gave it: That &s;o glorious a Per&s;on &s;hould become &s;ubject to the Law, and fulfil it, has done much more to honour it, than if meer Man had obeyed it: It was a Thing infinitely honourable to God that a Per&s;on of infinite Dignity was not a&s;hamed to call him <HI>his God,</HI> and to adore and obey him as &s;uch: This was more to God's Honour than if any meer Crea|ture, of any po&s;&s;ible Degree of Excellency and Dignity, had &s;o done.</P>
<P>'Tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that in order to a Sinner's being ju&s;tified, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ome other &s;hould be reckoned to his Account; for 'tis declared that the Per&s;on ju&s;tified is looked upon as (in him&s;elf) <HI>ungod|ly;</HI> but God neither <HI>will</HI> nor <HI>can</HI> ju&s;tify a Per&s;on with|out a Righteou&s;ne&s;s; for Ju&s;tification is manife&s;tly a

of judging, is to determine <HI>what is,</HI> and <HI>what is not,</HI> in any one's Ca&s;e.

<P>And the Scheme of the old Law's being abrogated, and a new Law introduced, won't help at all in this difficulty; for an imperfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s cannot an|&s;wer the Law of God that we are under, whither that be an old one or a new one; for every Law requires perfect Obedience to it &s;elf: Every Rule what&s;oever requires perfect conformity to it &s;elf; 'tis a Contradicti|on to &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e; for to &s;ay, that there is a Law that don't require <HI>perfect</HI> Obedience to it &s;elf, is to &s;ay that there is a Law that don't require <HI>all</HI> that it re|quires. That Law that <HI>now</HI> forbids Sin, is certainly the Law that we are <HI>now</HI> under, (let that be an old one, or a new one;) or el&s;e it is <HI>not &s;in:</HI> That which is <HI>not</HI> for|bidden, and is the Breach of <HI>no</HI> Law, is <HI>no</HI> Sin: But if we are <HI>now</HI> forbidden to commit Sin, then 'tis by a Law that we are <HI>now</HI> under, for &s;urely we are neither under the forbiddings, nor commandings of a Law that we are not under. Therefore if all Sin is <HI>now</HI> forbid|den, then we are now under a Law that requires per|fect Obedience; and therefore nothing can be accepted as a Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the &s;ight of our Judge, but per|fect Righteou&s;ne&s;s So that our Judge cannot ju&s;tify us, unle&s;s he &s;ees a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ome way be|longing, to us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> performed by our &s;elves, or by another, and ju&s;tly and duly reckon'd to our Ac|count.</P>

God doth in the Sentence of Ju&s;tification pro|nounce a Man <HI>perfectly Righteous,</HI> or el&s;e he would need a further Ju&s;tification after he is ju&s;tified: His Sins being removed by Chri&s;t's Atonement, is not &s;uf|ficient for his Ju&s;tification; for ju&s;tifying a Man, as has been already &s;hewn, is not meerly pronouncing him <HI>in|nocent</HI> or <HI>without Guilt,</HI> but &s;tanding Right, with regard to the Rule that he is under, and righteous unto Life; But this according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Rule of Nature, Rea&s;on, and Divine Appointment, is a po&s;itive perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<P>When Chri&s;t had once undertaken with God, to &s;tand for us, and put him&s;elf under our Law, <HI>by that Law</HI> he was obliged to <HI>&s;uffer</HI> and <HI>by the &s;ame Law</HI> he was obliged to obey: By the &s;ame Law, after he had taken Man's Guilt upon him&punc; he <HI>him&s;elf</HI> being our Surety, could not be <HI>acquitted,</HI> till he had <HI>&s;uffer'd,</HI> nor

The Scripture teaches us, that when Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the dead, he was ju&s;tified; which Ju&s;ti|fication as I have already &s;hewn, implies, both his Ac|quittance from our Guilt, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is Acceptance to the Exaltation and Glory that was the Reward of his O|bedience: But believers, as &s;oon as they Believe are admitted to partake with Chri&s;t in this his Ju&s;tification: Hence we are told that he was <HI>rai&s;ed again for our Ju&s;tification,</HI> Rom 4. 25. Which is true, not only of that Part of his Ju&s;tification that con&s;i&s;ts in his Acquit|tance; but al&s;o his Acceptance to his Reward: The Scripture teaches us that he is exalted, and gone to Heaven, to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Glory <HI>in our Name,</HI> as our forerunner. <HI>Heb</HI> 6 20 We are as it were both <HI>rai&s;ed up together with Chri&s;t,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>made to &s;et to|gether with Chri&s;t, in heavenly Places, and in Him.</HI> Eph 2. 6.</P>
<P>If it be objected here, that there is <HI>this Rea&s;on,</HI> why what Chri&s;t &s;uffer'd &s;hould be accepted on our Account rather than the Obedience he performed, that <HI>he was obliged to Obedience for him&s;elf, but was not obliged to &s;uffer but only on our Account.</HI> To this I an&s;wer, that Chri&s;t was not obliged on his own Account, to <HI>under|take</HI> to obey. Chri&s;t in his original Circum&s;tances, was in no &s;ubjection to the Father, being altogether equal with him: He was under no Obligation to put him&s;elf in Man's &s;tead, and under Man's Law, or to put him&s;elf into any State of Subjection to God what|&s;oever. There was a Tran&s;action between the Father and the Son, that was antecedent to Chri&s;t's becoming Man&punc; and being made under the Law, wherein he un|dertook to put him&s;elf under the Law, and both to obey and to &s;uffer&punc; in which Tran&s;action the&s;e Things were already vertually done in the &s;ight of God; as is evident by this, that God acted on the Ground of
<PB N="63" REF="004239_0070_10042BAEAD6F1698">
that Tran&s;action, ju&s;tifying and &s;aving Sinners, as if the Things undertaken had been actually performed long before they were performed indeed&punc; And therefore, without doubt, in order to the e&s;timating the value, and validity of what Chri&s;t did and &s;uffered, we mu&s;t look back to that Tran&s;action, wherein the&s;e Things were fir&s;t undertaken, and vertually done in the &s;ight of God, and &s;ee what Capacity and Circum&s;tances Chri&s;t acted in then, and then we &s;hall find that Chri&s;t was under no manner of Obligation, either to obey the Law, or &s;uffer the Penalty of it. After this he was equally under Obligation to both; for henceforward he &s;tood as our Surety or Repre&s;entative: And therefore this con&s;equent Obligation, may be as much of an Objection again&s;t the validity of his &s;uffering the Penalty, as again&s;t his Obedience. But if we look to that original Tran&s;action between the Father and the Son, wherein both th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e were undertaken and ac|cepted, as vertually done in the &s;ight of the Father, we &s;hall find Chri&s;t acting with Regard to both, as one perfectly in his own Right, and under no manner of previous Obligation, to hinder the validity of either.</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;uppo&s;e that all that Chri&s;t does is only to make Atonement for us by &s;uffering, is to make him our Saviour but in Part. 'Tis to rob him of half his Glory as a Saviour. For if &s;o, all that he does is to de|liver us from Hell, he don't purcha&s;e Heaven for us. The adver&s;e Scheme &s;uppo&s;es that he purcha&s;es Heaven for us, in this Sen&s;e, that he &s;atisfies for the imper|fections of our Obedience, and &s;o purcha&s;es that our &s;incere imperfect Obedience might be accepted as the Condition of eternal Life; and &s;o purcha&s;es an op|portunity for us to obtain Heaven by our own Obedi|ence. But to purcha&s;e Heaven for us, only in this Sen&s;e, is to purcha&s;e it in no Sen&s;e at all; for all of it comes to no more than a Satisfaction for our Sins, or removing the Penalty by &s;uffering in our &s;tead: For all the purcha&s;ing they &s;peak of, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> imperfect Obedience &s;hould be accepted, is only his &s;atisfying
<PB N="64" REF="004239_0071_10042BB646B69508">
for the &s;inful imperfection of our Obedience, or (which is the &s;ame Thing) making Atonement for the Sin that our Obedience is attended with. But that is not pur|cha&s;ing Heaven, meerly to &s;et us at Liberty again, that we may go, and get Heaven by what we do our &s;elves: all that Chri&s;t does is only to pay a Debt for us; there is no po&s;itive Purcha&s;e of any Good.&mdash;We are taught in Scripture that Heaven is <HI>purcha&s;ed</HI> for us, 'tis called the <HI>purcha&s;ed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> Eph. 1. 14. The Go&s;pel pro|po&s;es the eternal Inheritance, not to be acquired, as the fir&s;t Covenant did, but as already acquired and purcha|&s;ed: But he that pays a Man's Debt for him, and &s;o de|livers him from Slavery, can't be &s;aid to purcha&s;e an E&s;tate for him, meerly becau&s;e he &s;ets him at Liberty, &s;o that henceforward he has an opportunity to get an E&s;tate by his own hand Labour. So that according to this Scheme, the Saints in Heaven have no Rea&s;on to thank Chri&s;t for purcha&s;ing Heaven for 'em, or re|deeming them <HI>to God,</HI> and making them King's and Prie&s;t's, as we have an Account that they do in <HI>Rev.</HI>5. 9</P>

So that Chri&s;t's laying down his Life might be Part of that Obedience by which we are ju&s;tified, tho' it was a po&s;itive Precept, not given to <HI>Adam.</HI> It was doubt|le&s;s Chri&s;t's main Act of Obedience, becau&s;e it was Obe|dience to a Command that was attended with immen&s;ely the greate&s;t Difficulty, and &s;o to a Command that was the greate&s;t Trial of his Obedience; his Re&s;pect &s;hown to God in it, and his Honour to God's Authority, was pro|portionably great: It is &s;poken of in Scripture as Chri&s;t's principal Act of Obedience. Philip. 2. 7, 8. <HI>But made him&s;elf of no Reputation, and took upon him</HI> the Form of a Servant, <HI>and was made in the Likene&s;s of Man, and be|ing found in Fa&s;hion as a Man, he humbled him&s;elf and</HI> became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s Heb. 5. 8 <HI>Though he were a Son, yet learned he Obedience by the Things that he &s;uffered.</HI> It was mainly by this Act of Obedience, that Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed &s;o glo|rious a Reward <HI>for him&s;elf;</HI> as in that Place in Philippi|ans 2. 8, 9. <HI>He became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s;</HI> wherefore <HI>God al&s;o hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name, which is above every Name:</HI> And it therefore follows from what has been already &s;aid, that it's mainly by this Act of Obedience, that Believers in Chri&s;t al&s;o, have the Reward of Glory, or come to partake with Chri&s;t in his Glory. We are as much &s;a|ved by the Death of Chri&s;t, as his yielding him&s;elf to die <HI>was an Act of Obedience,</HI> as we are, as it was <HI>a Pro|pitiation for our Sins:</HI> For as it was not the only Act of Obedience that merited, he having performed meritori|ous Acts of Obedience through the whole Cour&s;e of his Life; &s;o neither was it the only Suffering that was pro|pitiatory; all his Sufferings through the whole Cour&s;e of his Life being propitiatory, as well as every Act of Obedience meritorious: Indeed this was his <HI>principal Suffering;</HI> and it was as much his <HI>principal Act of Obe|dience.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we may &s;ee how that the Death of Chri&s;t did not only make Atonement, but al&s;o merited eternal Life; and hence we may &s;ee how by the Blood of Chri&s;t we are not only redeemed from Sin, but <HI>redeemed unto

God;</HI> and therefore the Scripture &s;eems every where to attribute the whole of Salvation to the Blood of Chri&s;t: This precious Blood is as much the main Price by which <HI>Heaven is purcha&s;ed,</HI> as 'tis the main Price by which we are <HI>redeemed from Hell.</HI> The po&s;itive Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, or <HI>that Price</HI> by which he merited, was of equal Value with <HI>that</HI> by which he &s;atisfied; for in|deed it was the &s;ame Price: <HI>He &s;pill'd his Blood</HI> to &s;atis|fy, and by Rea&s;on of the infinite Dignity of his Per&s;on, his Sufferings were looked upon as of infinite Value, and equivalent to the eternal Sufferings of a finite Creature: And <HI>he &s;pill'd his Blood</HI> out of Re&s;pect to the Honour of God's Maje&s;ty, and in Submi&s;&s;ion to his Authority, who had commanded him &s;o to do, and his Obedience there in was of infinite Value; both becau&s;e of the Dignity of the Per&s;on that performed it, and becau&s;e he put him|&s;elf to infinite Expence to perform it, whereby the infi|nite Degree of his Regard to God's Authority appear'd.</P>
<P>One would wonder what <HI>Arminians</HI> mean by Chri&s;t's <HI>Merits:</HI> They talk of Chri&s;t's <HI>Merits</HI> as much as any Body, and yet deny the Imputation of Chri&s;t's po&s;itive Righteou&s;ne&s;s: What &s;hould there be that any one &s;hould merit or de&s;erve any Thing by, be&s;ides Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s or Goodne&s;s? If any Thing that Chri&s;t did or &s;uffered, merited or de&s;erved any Thing&punc; it was by Vir|tue of the Goodne&s;s, or Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or Holine&s;s of it: If Chri&s;t's Sufferings and Death merited Heaven, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e there was an excellent Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and tran&s;cendent moral Goodne&s;s in that Act of laying down his Life: And if by that excellent Righteou&s;ne&s;s he merited Heaven <HI>for us,</HI> then &s;urely that Righteou&s;|ne&s;s is <HI>reckon'd to our Account,</HI> that we have the Benefit of it, or which is the &s;ame Thing, <HI>it is imputed to us.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I hope I have made it evident, that the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is indeed imputed to us. I proceed now to the</P>

<P>Here perhaps it may be &s;aid, that a Title to Salvation is not directly given as the Reward of our Obedience; for that is not by any Thing of ours; but only by Chri&s;t's Satisfaction and Righteou&s;ne&s;s; but yet an <HI>In|tere&s;t in</HI> that Satisfaction and Righteou&s;ne&s;s is given as a Reward of our Obedience.</P>
<P>But this don't at all help the Ca&s;e; for this is to a&s;|cribe as much to our Obedience, as if we a&s;cribed Sal|vation to it <HI>directly,</HI> without the Intervention of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s: For it would be as great a Thing for God to give us Chri&s;t, and his Satisfaction and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, in Reward for our Obedience, as to give us Heaven <HI>immediately;</HI> it would be as great a Reward, and as great a Te&s;timony of re&s;pect to our Obedience.

So that it is not by Vertue of our Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t and his Merits, that we fir&s;t come into Favour with God, according to this Scheme; for we are in God's Favour before we have any Intere&s;t in tho&s;e Merits; in that we have an Intere&s;t in tho&s;e Merits given as a Fruit of God's Favour for our own Vertue.

As when a Man offers him&s;elf to a Woman in Marriage, he don't give him&s;elf to her as a Reward of her receiv|ing him in Marriage: Her receiving him is not con&s;i|der'd as a worthy Deed in her, for which he rewards her&punc; by giving him&s;elf to her; but 'tis by her receiving him, that <HI>the Union is made,</HI> by which &s;he hath him for her Husband: 'Tis on her Part the Unition it &s;elf.&mdash;By the&s;e Things it appears how contrary to the Scheme of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, their Scheme is, who &s;ay that Faith ju&s;tifies <HI>as a 'Principle of Obedience,</HI> or as a <HI>leading Act of Obedience;</HI> or (as others) <HI>the Sum,</HI> and <HI>Comprehen|&s;ion</HI> of all evangelical Obedience: For by this 'tis the Obedience or Virtue that is in Faith, that is the Thing, that gives it its ju&s;tifying Influence; and that is the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay, that we are ju&s;tified by our own Obedi|ence, Virtue or Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the Evidence of the Truth of the Doctrine, I proceed now to the</P>
<P>IIId Thing propo&s;ed, viz. <HI>To &s;hew in what Sen&s;e the Acts of a chri&s;tian Life, or of evangelical Obedience, may be looked upon to be concern'd in this Affair.</HI></P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid already, it is manife&s;t that they cannot have any Concern in this Affair as <HI>good Works,</HI> or by Virtue of any moral Goodne&s;s in them; not as Works of the Law, or as that moral Excellency, or any Part of it, that is the an&s;wering or Fulfilment of that great, and univer&s;al, and everla&s;ting Law or Co|venant of Works, that the great Lawgiver has e&s;tab|li&s;hed, as the highe&s;t and unalterable Rule of Judg|ment; which Chri&s;t alone an&s;wers, or does any Thing towards it.</P>
<P>And it having been &s;hown, out of the Scripture, that 'tis only by Faith, or the Soul's receiving, and uniting to the Saviour, that has wrought out Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that we are ju&s;tified; it therefore remains that the Acts of a chri&s;tian Life can't be concerned in this Af|fair any otherwi&s;e, than as they imply, and are the Expre&s;&s;ions of Faith, and may be looked upon as &s;o many Acts of Reception of Chri&s;t the Saviour.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="004239_0083_10042BD74EB64410">
But the determining what concern Acts of chri&s;tian Obedience can have in Ju&s;tification in this Re&s;pect, will depend on the re&s;olving of another Point, <HI>viz</HI> Whe|ther any other Act of Faith be&s;ides the fir&s;t Act, has any Concern in our Ju&s;tification, or how far Per&s;everance in Faith, or the continued and renewed Acts of Faith, have Influence in this Affair.</P>
<P>And it &s;eems manife&s;t that Ju&s;tification is <HI>by</HI> the fir&s;t Act of Faith, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, in a Peculiar Manner, becau&s;e a Sinner is actually and finally ju&s;tified as &s;oon as he has performed one Act of Faith; and Faith in its fir&s;t Act does, virtually at lea&s;t, depend on God for Per&s;everance, and intitles to this among other Benefits. But yet the Per&s;everance of Faith is not excluded in this Affair; it is not only certainly connected with Ju&s;tifi|cation, but it is not to be excluded from that on which the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner has a <HI>Dependance,</HI> or that <HI>by which</HI> he is ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>I have &s;hown that the Way in which Ju&s;tification has a Dependance on Faith, is that it is the Qualification on which the <HI>Congruity</HI> of an Intere&s;t in the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t depends, or wherein &s;uch a Fitne&s;s con|&s;i&s;ts. But the Con&s;ideration of the Per&s;everance of Faith, can't be excluded out of this Congruity or Fitne&s;s, for it is congruous that he that believes in Chri&s;t &s;hould have an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o in the eternal Benefits purcha&s;ed by it, becau&s;e Faith is that by which the Soul hath Union or Onene&s;s with Chri&s;t, and there is a natural Congruity in it, that they that are one with Chri&s;t, &s;hould have a joint Intere&s;t with him in his eternal Benefits; but yet this Congruity depends on its being an <HI>abiding Union.</HI> As it is needful that the Branch &s;hould abide in the Vine, in order to its receiv|ing the la&s;ting Benefits of the Root, &s;o it is nece&s;&s;ary that the Soul &s;hould abide in Chri&s;t, in order to its re|ceiving tho&s;e la&s;ting Benefits of God's final Acceptance and Favour. John 15. 6, 7. <HI>If a Man abide not in me, he is ca&s;t forth as a Branch. If ye abide in me, and my Words abide you, ye &s;hall ask what ye will, and it &s;hall be done unto you.</HI> Ver&s;es 9, 10. <HI>Continue ye in my Love: If
<PB N="77" REF="004239_0084_100404770B8C9AA0">
ye keep</HI> (or abide in) <HI>my Commandments, ye &s;hall abide in my Love, even as I have kept my Father's Command|ments, and abide in his Love.</HI> There is the &s;ame Rea&s;on why it is nece&s;&s;ary that the Union with Chri&s;t &s;hould remain, as why it &s;hould be begun, why it &s;hould con|tinue to be, as why it &s;hould once be: If it &s;hould be begun without remaining, the beginning would be in vain. In order to the Soul's being <HI>now</HI> in a ju&s;tified State, and <HI>now</HI> free from Condemnation, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould <HI>now</HI> be in Chri&s;t, and not only that it &s;hould once have been in him. Rom. 8. 1. <HI>There is no Con|demnation to them are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> The Soul is &s;aved <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t, as being now in him, when the Salvation is be&s;towed, and not meerly as remembring that it <HI>once was</HI> in him. Philip. 3 9. <HI>That I may be FOUND IN HIM, not having mine own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chri&s;t, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by Faith.</HI> 1 John 2. 28. <HI>And now little Children abide in him; that when he &s;hall appear, we may have Confidence, and not be a&s;hamed before him at his Coming.</HI> In order to Per&s;ons being ble&s;&s;ed after Death, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary not only that they &s;hould once be in him, but that they &s;hould <HI>die in him.</HI> Rev. 14. 13. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead that die in the Lord</HI></P>
<P>And there is the &s;ame Rea&s;on why Faith, the uniting Qualification, &s;hould remain, in order to the Union's re|maining, as why it &s;hould once be, in order to the Uni|on's once being.</P>
<P>So that altho' the Sinner is actually, and finally ju&s;ti|fied on the fir&s;t Act of Faith, yet the Per&s;everance of Faith, even then, comes into Con&s;ideration, as one Thing on which the Fitne&s;s of Acceptance to Life de|pends&punc; God in the Act of Ju&s;tification, which is pa&s;&s;ed on a Sinner's fir&s;t believing, has Re&s;pect to Per&s;everance, as being virtually contain'd in that fir&s;t Act of Faith; and 'tis looked upon and taken by him that ju&s;tifies, as being as it were a Property in that Faith that then is: God has Re&s;pect to the Believer's Continuance in Faith, and he is ju&s;tified by that, as tho' it already were, be|cau&s;e by divine E&s;tabli&s;hment it &s;hall follow; and it be|ing
<PB N="78" REF="004239_0085_10042BDA193E0D28">
by divine Con&s;titution connected with that fir&s;t Faith, as much as if it were a Property in it, it is then con&s;ider'd as &s;uch, and &s;o Ju&s;tification is not &s;u&s;pended; but were it not for this it would be needful that it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended, till the Sinner had actually per|&s;evered in Faith.</P>
<P>And that it is &s;o, that God in that Act of final Ju&s;ti|fication that he pa&s;&s;es at the Sinner's Conver&s;ion, has Re&s;pect to Per&s;everance in Faith, and future Acts of Faith, as being virtually implied in that fir&s;t Act, is fur|ther manife&s;t by this, <HI>viz.</HI> That in a Sinner's Ju&s;tificati|on at his Conver&s;ion, there is virtually contained a For|givene&s;s as to eternal, and de&s;erved Puni&s;hment, not on|ly of all pa&s;t Sins, but al&s;o of all future Infirmities and Acts of Sin, that they &s;hall be guilty of; becau&s;e that fir&s;t Ju&s;tification is deci&s;ive and final. And yet Pardon, in the Order of Nature, properly follows the Crime, and al&s;o follows tho&s;e Acts of Repentance and Faith that re&s;pect the Crime pardoned, as is manife&s;t both from Rea&s;on and Scripture. <HI>David</HI> in the beginning of <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 32. &s;peaks of the Forgivene&s;s of Sins of his, that were doubtle&s;s committed long after he was fir&s;t godly, as being con&s;equent on tho&s;e Sins, and on his Repentance and Faith with Re&s;pect to them; and yet this Forgive|ne&s;s is &s;poken of by the Apo&s;tle in the 4th of <HI>Romans,</HI> as an In&s;tance of Ju&s;tification by Faith. Probably the Sin <HI>David</HI> there &s;peaks of is the &s;ame that he commit|ted in the Matter of <HI>Uriah,</HI> and &s;o the Pardon the &s;ame with that Relea&s;e from Death, or eternal Puni&s;hment, that the Prophet <HI>Nathan</HI> &s;peaks of, 2 Sam 12. 13. <HI>The Lord al&s;o hath put away thy Sin; thou &s;halt not die.</HI> Not only does the Manife&s;tation of this Pardon follow the Sin in the Order of Time, but the Pardon it &s;elf, in the Order of Nature, follows <HI>David's</HI> Repentance and Faith with Re&s;pect to this Sin; for it is &s;poken of in the 32nd <HI>P&s;alm</HI> as depending on it.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, if no other Act of Faith could be con|cerned in Ju&s;tification but the fir&s;t Act, it will then fol|low that Chri&s;tians ought never to &s;eek Ju&s;tification by any other Act of Faith. For if Ju&s;tification is not to be
<PB N="79" REF="004239_0086_10042BDB9FEB2C50">
obtain'd by after Acts of Faith, then &s;urely it is not a Duty to &s;eek it by &s;uch Acts: And &s;o it can never be a Duty for Per&s;ons after they are once converted, by Faith to &s;eek to God; or believingly to look to him for the Re|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin, or Deliverance from the Guilt of it, be|cau&s;e Deliverance from the Guilt of Sin is Part of what belongs to Ju&s;tification. And if it ben't proper for Converts by Faith to look to God through Chri&s;t for it, then it will follow that it is not proper for them to pray for it, for chri&s;tian Prayer to God for a Ble&s;&s;ing is but an Expre&s;&s;ion of Faith in God for that Ble&s;&s;ing; Prayer is only the Voice of Faith. But if the&s;e Things are &s;o, it will follow that that Petition of the Lord's Prayer, <HI>for give us our Debts,</HI> is not proper to be put up by Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, or to be u&s;ed in chri&s;tian A&s;&s;em|blies, and that Chri&s;t improperly directed his Di&s;ciples to u&s;e that Petition, when they were all of them, ex|cept <HI>Judas,</HI> converted before. The Debt that Chri&s;t directs his Di&s;ciples to pray for the Forgivene&s;s of, can mean nothing el&s;e, but the Puni&s;hment that Sin de&s;erves, or the Debt that we owe to divine Ju&s;tice, the ten thou|&s;and Talents we owe our Lord. To pray that God would forgive our <HI>Debts,</HI> is undoubtedly the &s;ame Thing as to pray that God would relea&s;e us from Obligation to <HI>due Puni&s;hment;</HI> but relea&s;ing from Obligation to the Puni&s;hment due to Sin, and forgiving the Debt that we owe to divine Ju&s;tice, is what appertains to Ju&s;tifi|cation.</P>
<P>And then to &s;uppo&s;e that no after Acts of Faith are concerned in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Ju&s;tification, and &s;o that it is not proper for any ever to &s;eek Ju&s;tification by &s;uch Acts, would be forever to cut off tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, that are doubtful concerning their fir&s;t Act of Faith, from the Joy and Peace of Believing. As the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a ju&s;ti|fying Faith is to obtain Pardon and Peace with God, by looking to God and tru&s;ting in him for the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, &s;o the Joy and Peace of that Faith, is in the Apprehen|&s;ion of Pardon and Peace obtain'd by &s;uch a Tru&s;t. This a Chri&s;tian that is doubtful of his fir&s;t Act of Faith, can't have from that Act, becau&s;e, by the Suppo&s;ition,
<PB N="80" REF="004239_0087_10042BDD2748EA50">
he is doubtful whether it be an Act of Faith, and &s;o whether he did obtain Pardon and Peace by that Act: The proper Remedy, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, is now by Faith to look to God in Chri&s;t for the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings; but he is cut off from this Remedy, becau&s;e he is uncertain whether he has Warrant &s;o to do, for he don't know but that he has believed already; and if &s;o, then he has no Warrant to look to God by Faith for the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings now, becau&s;e by the Suppo&s;ition no new Act of Faith is a proper Means of obtaining the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings&punc; And &s;o he can never proper|ly obtain the Joy of Faith; for there are Acts of true Faith, that are very weak Acts, and the fir&s;t Act may be &s;o as well as others; it may be like the fir&s;t Motion of the Infant in the Womb, it may be &s;o weak an Act that the Chri&s;tian by examining of it, may never be able to determine whether it was a true Act of Faith or n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; and it is evident from Fact, and abundant Experience, that many Chri&s;tians are forever at a Lo&s;s to determine which was their fir&s;t Act of Faith. And tho&s;e Saints that have had a good Degree of Satisfaction concerning their Faith, may be &s;ubject to great Declen&s;ions and Falls, in which Ca&s;e they are liable to great Fears of eternal Puni&s;hment; and the proper Way of Deliverance is to for&s;ake their Sin by Repentance, and by Faith now to come to Chri&s;t for Deliverance from the de&s;erved eternal Puni&s;hment; but this it would not be, if Deli|verance from that Puni&s;hment, was not this Way to be obtain'd.</P>
<P>But what is a &s;till more plain and direct Evidence of what I am now arguing for, is that that Act of Faith that <HI>Abraham</HI> exerci&s;ed in the great Promi&s;e of the Co|venant of Grace that God made to him, of which it is ex|pre&s;ly &s;aid, Gen 15. 16. <HI>It was accounted to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> which is the grand In&s;tance and Proof, that the Apo&s;tle &s;o much in&s;i&s;ts upon throughout the 4th Chapter of <HI>Romans,</HI> and 3d. Chapter of <HI>Galatians,</HI> to confirm his Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, was not <HI>Abraham's</HI> fir&s;t A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Faith, but was ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ted long after he had by Faith for&s;aken his own Country, <HI>Heb. 11. 8.</HI> and had been treated as an eminent Friend of God.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="004239_0088_10042BDED1616EB0">
Moreover, The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in the third Chapter of <HI>Philippians,</HI> tells us how earne&s;tly he &s;ought Ju&s;tifi|cation by Faith, or to win Chri&s;t and obtain that Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which was by the Faith of him, in what he did after his Conver&s;ion. Ver&s;es 8, 9 <HI>For whom I have &s;uffered the lo&s;s of all Things, and do count them but, Dung that I may win Chri&s;t, and be found in him, not having on mine own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chri&s;t, the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by Faith.</HI> And in the two next Ver&s;es he expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame Thing in other Words, and tells us how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e went through Sufferings, and became conformable to Chri&s;t's Death, that he might be a Par|taker with Chri&s;t in the Benefit of his Re&s;urrection; which the &s;ame Apo&s;tle el&s;ewhere teaches us, is e&s;peci|ally Ju&s;tification: Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection was his Ju&s;tifi|cation; in this, he that was put to Death in the Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h, was ju&s;tified by the Spirit, and he that was delivered for our Offences, ro&s;e again for our Ju&s;tification. And the Apo&s;tle tells us in the Ver&s;es that follow, in that third Chapter of <HI>Philippians,</HI> that he thus fought to at|tain the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is through the Faith of Chri&s;t, and &s;o to partake of the Benefit of his Re&s;urrec|tion, &s;till, as tho' he had not already attain'd, but that he continued to follow after it.</P>
<P>But in as much as a Sinner, in his fir&s;t Ju&s;tification, is forever ju&s;tified and freed from all Obligation to eternal Puni&s;hment, it hence of nece&s;&s;ity follows, that future Faith and Repentance are beheld in that Ju&s;tification, as virtually contained in that fir&s;t Faith and Repentance; becau&s;e Repentance of tho&s;e future Sins, and Faith in a Redeemer, with Re&s;pect to them, or, at lea&s;t, the Con|tinuance of that Habit and Principle in the Heart, that has &s;uch an actual Repentance and Faith, in it's Nature and Tendency, is now made &s;ure by God's Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>If Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, committed after Conver&s;ion, in the order of Nature, follows that Faith and Repentance that is after them, then it follows that future <HI>Sins</HI> are re|&s;pected in the fir&s;t Ju&s;tification, no otherwi&s;e than as <HI>future Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI> are re&s;pected in it. And
<PB N="82" REF="004239_0089_100404792E279CE0">
future Repentance and Faith are looked upon by him that ju&s;tifies, as virtually implied in the fir&s;t Repentance and Faith, in the &s;ame Manner as Ju&s;tification from future Sins, is virtually implied in the fir&s;t Ju&s;tification; which is the Thing that was to be proved.</P>
<P>On the whole, it appears that the Per&s;everance of Faith is nece&s;&s;ary, even to the Congruity of Ju&s;tification, and that not the le&s;s, becau&s;e a Sinner is ju&s;tified, and Per&s;everance promi&s;ed on the fir&s;t Act of Faith, but God in that Ju&s;tification has Re&s;pect not only to the pa&s;t Act of Faith, but to his own Promi&s;e of future Acts, and to the fitne&s;s of a Qualification beheld as yet only in his own Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>And, that Per&s;everance in Faith is thus nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, not meerly as a <HI>&s;ine qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">non,</HI> or as an univer&s;al Concomitant of it, but by Rea&s;on of &s;uch an Influence and Dependance, &s;eems manife&s;t by many Scriptures; I would mention two or three; Heb. 3. 6. <HI>Who&s;e Hou&s;e are we, if we hold fa&s;t the Confidence, and the Rejoycing of the Hope, firm unto the End.</HI> Ver&s;e 14. <HI>For we are made Partakers of Chri&s;t, if we hold the beginning of our Confidence, &s;tedfa&s;t unto the End.</HI> Chap. 5 12. <HI>Be ye fol|lowers of them, who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promi&s;es.</HI> Rom 11. 20. <HI>Well, becau&s;e of Unbelief they were broken off, but thou &s;tande&s;t by Faith: Be not high|minded, but fear.</HI></P>
<P>And as the Congruity to a final Ju&s;tification depends on Per&s;everance in Faith, as well as the fir&s;t Act, &s;o of|tentimes the Manife&s;tation of Ju&s;tification in the Con|&s;cience, ari&s;es a great deal more from after Acts, than the fir&s;t Act. And all the difference whereby the fir&s;t Act of Faith has a Concern in this Affair that is peculiar, &s;eems to be as it were only an accidental Differ|ence, ari&s;ing from the Circum&s;tance of Time, or its be|ing fir&s;t in Order of Time; and not from any peculiar Re&s;pect that God has to it, or any Influence it has of a peculiar Nature, in the Affair of our Salvation.</P>
<P>And thus it is that a truly chri&s;tian Walk, and the Acts of an evangelical, child like, believing Obedience, are concerned in the Affair of our Ju&s;tification, and &s;eem
<PB N="83" REF="004239_0090_10042BE605191978">
to be &s;ometimes &s;o &s;poken of in Scripture, <HI>viz.</HI> as an Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of a per&s;evering Faith in the Son of God, the only Saviour. Faith unites to Chri&s;t, and &s;o gives a Congruity to Ju&s;tification, not meerly as remaining a dormant Principle in the Heart, but as being, and ap|pearing in its active Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Obedience of a Chri&s;tian, &s;o far as it is truly evan|gelical, and performed with the Spirit of the Son &s;ent forth into the Heart, has all relation to Chri&s;t the Medi|ator, and is but an Expre&s;&s;ion of the Soul's believing Unition to Chri&s;t: All evangelical Works are Works of that Faith that worketh by Love; and every &s;uch Act of Obedience, wherein it is inward, and the Act of the Soul, is only a new effective Act of Reception of Chri&s;t, and Adherence to the glorious Saviour. Hence that of the Apo&s;tle, Gal 2. 20. <HI>I live, yet not I; but Chri&s;t liveth in me; and the Life that I now live in the Fle&s;h, is by the Faith of the Son of God.</HI> And hence we are directed, in whatever we do, whether in Word or Deed&punc; to do all in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 17.</P>
<P>And that God in Ju&s;tification has re&s;pect, not only to the fir&s;t Act of Faith, but al&s;o to future per&s;evering Acts, in this Sen&s;e, <HI>viz</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eems manife&s;t by <HI>Rom</HI> 1. 17. <HI>For therein is the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of God revealed, from Faith to Faith: As it is writ|ten, the Ju&s;t &s;hall live by Faith.</HI> And Heb. 10. 38, 39. <HI>Now the Ju&s;t &s;hall live by Faith; but if any Man draw back, my Soul &s;hall have no Plea&s;ure in him. But we are not of them that draw back unto Perdition, but of them that believe to the &s;aving of the Soul.</HI></P>
<P>So that as was before &s;aid of Faith, &s;o may it be &s;aid of a child like, believing Obedience, it has no concern in Ju&s;tification by any Vertue, or Excellency in it; but only as there is a Reception of Chri&s;t in it. And this is no more contrary to the Apo&s;tle's frequent A&s;&s;ertion of our being ju&s;tified without the Works of the Law, than to &s;ay that we are ju&s;tified by Faith; for Faith is as much a Work or act of chri&s;tian Obedience, as the Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of Faith, in &s;piritual Life and Walk. And
<PB N="84" REF="004239_0091_10042BE789769F68">
therefore as we &s;ay that Faith don't ju&s;tify as a Work, &s;o we &s;ay of all the&s;e effective Expre&s;&s;ions of Faith.</P>
<P>This is the rever&s;e of the Scheme of our modern Di|vines&punc; who hold that Faith ju&s;tifies only as an Act, or Expre&s;&s;ion of Obedience; whereas in Truth&punc; Obedience has no concern in Ju&s;tification, any otherwi&s;e than as an Expre&s;&s;ion of Faith.</P>

<P><HI>Object</HI> 1 We frequently find Promi&s;es of eternal Life and Salvation, and &s;ometimes of Ju&s;tification it&s;elf, made to our own Vertue and Obedience.

And Ju&s;tification it &s;elf is promi&s;ed to that Vertue of a forgiving Spirit or Tem|per in us, Mat. 6 14 <HI>For if ye forgive Men their Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;e, your heavenly Father will al&s;o forgive you; but if ye forgive not Men their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your Father forgive your Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> All allow that Ju&s;tifica|tion in great Part con&s;i&s;ts i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>forgivene&s;s of Sins.</HI></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1 The&s;e Things being promi&s;ed to our Vertue and Obedience, argues no more, than that there is a Con|nection between them and evangelical Obedience; which I have already ob&s;erved is not the Thing in di&s;|pute. All that can be proved by Obedience and Salva|tion being connected <HI>in the Promi&s;e,</HI> is that Obedience and Salvation are <HI>connected in fact;</HI> which no body de|nies, and whether it be own'd or denied, is as has been &s;hewn, nothing to the Purpo&s;e. There is no need that an Admi&s;&s;ion to a Title to Salvation, &s;hould be given <HI>on the Account</HI> of our Obedience, in order to the Pro|mi&s;es being true. If we find &s;uch a Promi&s;e, that <HI>he that obeys &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> or <HI>he that is holy &s;hall be ju&s;ti|fied,</HI> all that is needful in order to &s;uch Promi&s;es being true, is that it <HI>be really &s;o,</HI> that he that obeys <HI>&s;hall</HI> be &s;aved, and that Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tification <HI>&s;hall indeed</HI> go together: That Propo&s;ition may be a Truth, that
<PB N="85" REF="004239_0092_1004047F08777B00">
<HI>he that obeys &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> becau&s;e Obedience and Sal|vation are connected together <HI>in fact;</HI> and yet an Ac|ceptance to a Title to Salvation not be granted upon the Account of any of our own Vertue or Obedience. What is a Promi&s;e, but only a Declaration of future Truth, for the Comfort and Encouragement of the Per|&s;on to whom it is declared? Promi&s;es are conditional Propo&s;itions; and as has been already ob&s;erved, it is not the Thing in Di&s;pute, whether other Things be&s;ides Faith mayn't have the Place of the Condition in &s;uch Propo&s;itions wherein Pardon and Salvation are the <HI>con|&s;equent.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> may rationally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e made to <HI>Signs</HI> and Evi|dences of Faith, and yet the <HI>Thing promi&s;ed</HI> not be upon the Account of the <HI>Sign,</HI> but the <HI>Thing &s;ignified.</HI> Thus for In&s;tance, human Government may rationally make Promi&s;es of &s;uch and &s;uch Priviledges, to tho&s;e that can &s;hew &s;uch <HI>Evidences</HI> of their being free of &s;uch a City, or Members of &s;uch a Corporation, or de&s;cended of &s;uch a Family; when it is not at all for the &s;ake of that which is the <HI>Evidence</HI> or <HI>Sign,</HI> in it &s;elf con&s;ider'd, that they are admitted to &s;uch a Priviledge, but only, and purely, for the &s;ake of that which it is an evidence of.</P>
<P>And tho' God don't &s;tand in need of Signs to know whether we have true Faith or not, yet our own Con|&s;ciences <HI>do;</HI> &s;o that 'tis much for our Comfort that Promi&s;es are made to Signs of Faith. A finding in our &s;elves a forgiving Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition, may be a mo&s;t proper and natural Evidence to our Con&s;ciences that our Hearts have, in a Sen&s;e of our own utter unworthine&s;s, truly clo&s;ed&punc; and fallen in, with the way of free, and infinitely gracious forgivene&s;s of <HI>our</HI> Sins, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; whence we may be ena|bled, with the greater Comfort to apply to our &s;elves the Promi&s;es of forgivene&s;s by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. It has been ju&s;t now &s;hown&punc; how that Acts of evangelical Obedience are indeed concern'd in our Ju&s;tification it &s;elf, and are not excluded from that Condition that Ju&s;tification depends upon, without the lea&s;t Prejudice to that Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by
<PB N="86" REF="004239_0093_10042BEAC776E380">
Faith, without any Goodne&s;s of our own, that has been maintain'd, and therefore it can be no Objection again&s;t this Doctrine, that we have &s;ometimes in Scripture, Promi&s;es of Pardon and Acceptance, made to &s;uch Acts of Obedience.</P>
<P N="4">4. Promi&s;es of particular Benefits implied in Ju&s;tifi|cation and Salvation, may e&s;pecially be fitly made to &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions and Evidences of Faith, as they have a peculiar natural Likene&s;s and Suitablene&s;s to: As <HI>for|givene&s;s</HI> is promi&s;ed to a <HI>forgiving Spirit</HI> in us; <HI>obtain|ing Mercy</HI> is fitly promi&s;ed to <HI>mercifulne&s;s</HI> in us, and the like: And that upon &s;everal Accounts; they are the mo&s;t natural Evidences of our Heart's clo&s;ing with tho&s;e Benefits by Faith; for they do e&s;pecially &s;hew the &s;weet Accord and Con&s;ent that there is between the Heart and the&s;e Benefits; and by Rea&s;on of the na|tural Likene&s;s that there is between the <HI>Vertue</HI> and the <HI>Benefit,</HI> the one has the greater Tendency to bring the other to mind; the Practice of the Vertue tends the more to renew the Sen&s;e, and refre&s;h the Hope of the Ble&s;&s;ing promi&s;ed; and al&s;o to convince the Con&s;cience of the ju&s;tice of being denied the Benefit, if the Duty be neglected.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides the Sen&s;e and Manife&s;tation of divine Forgivene&s;s in our own Con&s;ciences; yea and many Ex|erci&s;es of God's forgiving Mercy, as it re&s;pects God's fatherly Di&s;plea&s;ure, that are granted <HI>after Ju&s;tification,</HI> thro' the cour&s;e of a chri&s;tian's Life, may be given as the proper <HI>Rewards</HI> of the Vertue of a forgiving Spirit, and yet this not be at all to the prejudice of the Doc|trine we have maintain'd; as will more fully appear, when we come to an&s;wer another Objection hereafter to be mention'd.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. Our own Obedience, and inherent Holi|ne&s;s, is nece&s;&s;ary to prepare Men <HI>for Heaven;</HI> and therefore is doubtle&s;s what recommends Per&s;ons to God's Acceptance, as the Heirs <HI>of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. Our own Obedience being nece&s;&s;ary, in order to a Preparation for an actual be&s;towment of Glory, is no
<PB N="87" REF="004239_0094_10042BEC6CF571F8">
Argument that 'tis the Thing, upon the Account of which we are accepted to a Right to it. God <HI>may,</HI> and <HI>does,</HI> do many Things to prepare the Saints for Glory, after he has accepted them as the Heirs of Glory. A Parent may do much to prepare a Child for an Inheri|tance in it's Education, after the Child is an Heir: yea there are many Things nece&s;&s;ary to fit a Child for the actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Inheritance, that ben't nece&s;&s;ary in order to it's having a Right to the Inheritance.</P>
<P N="2">2. If every Thing, that is nece&s;&s;ary to prepare Men for Glory, mu&s;t be the proper Condition of Ju&s;tifica|tion, then perfect Holine&s;s is the Condition of Ju&s;tifi|cation. Men mu&s;t be made perfectly Holy, before they are admitted to the Enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of Heaven; for there mu&s;t <HI>in no wi&s;e</HI> enter in there any &s;piritual Defilement: And therefore when a Saint dies he leaves all his Sin and Corruption, when he leaves the Body.</P>
<P><HI>Object</HI> 3. Our Obedience is not only indi&s;&s;olubly connected with Salvation, and Preparatory to it, but the Scripture expre&s;ly &s;peaks of be&s;towing eternal Ble&s;&s;ings as <HI>Rewards</HI> for the good Deeds of the Saints. Math. 10 42. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall give to drink, unto one of the&s;e little ones, a Cup of cold Water, only in the Name of a Di&s;ciple, he &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e his Reward.</HI> 1 Cor. 3. 8. <HI>Every Man &s;hall receive his own Reward, accord|ing to his own Labour.</HI> And in many other Places. This &s;eems to militate again&s;t the Doctrine that has been maintain'd, two Ways, 1. The be&s;towing a Re|ward carries in it a Re&s;pect to a <HI>moral Fitne&s;s,</HI> in the Thing rewarded, to the Reward: The very Notion of a Reward being a Benefit be&s;towed in Te&s;timony of Acceptance <HI>of,</HI> and re&s;pect to, the goodne&s;s or amiable|ne&s;s of &s;ome Qualification or Work, in the Per&s;on re|warded. And be&s;ides the Scripture &s;eems to explain it &s;elf in this Matter, in <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 4. <HI>Thou ha&s;t a few Names, even in</HI> Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dis, <HI>which have not defiled their Gar|ments; and they &s;hall walk with me in Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e;</HI> for they are Worthy This is here given as the Rea&s;on why they &s;hould have &s;uch a Reward, <HI>becau&s;e they were Wor|thy:</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="004239_0095_10042BF2F1BB6260">
Which, tho' we &s;uppo&s;e it to imply no proper <HI>Merit,</HI> yet it at lea&s;t implies a moral fitne&s;s, or that the excellency of their Vertue in God's Sight, <HI>recommends</HI> them to &s;uch a Reward; which &s;eems directly repug|nant to what has been &s;uppo&s;ed, <HI>viz</HI> That we are ac|cepted, and approved of God, as the Heirs of Salvation, not out of Regard to the Excellency of our own Vir|tue or Goodne&s;s, or any <HI>moral fitne&s;s</HI> therein to &s;uch a Reward, but only on the Account of the Dignity, and <HI>moral fitne&s;s</HI> of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s. 2 Our being eternally rewarded for our own Holine&s;s, and good Works, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es that our future Happine&s;s will be greater or &s;maller, in &s;ome Proportion, as our own Holine&s;s and Obedience is more or le&s;s; and that there are different Degrees of Glory, according to dif|ferent Degrees of Vertue and good Works, is a Doc|trine very expre&s;ly, and frequently taught us in Scrip|ture. But this &s;eems quite incon&s;i&s;tent with the Saints all having their future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s as a Reward of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s: For if Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s be imputed to all, and this be what entitles each one to Glory, then 'tis the &s;ame Righteou&s;ne&s;s that entitles one to Glory, which entitles another: But if all have Glo|ry as the Reward of the <HI>&s;ame Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> why han't all the <HI>&s;ame Glory?</HI> Don't the &s;ame Righteou&s;ne&s;s me|rit as much Glory, when imputed to one, as when imputed to another.</P>
<P>In <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Part of this Objection. I would ob&s;erve, that it don't argue that we are ju&s;tified by our good Deeds, becau&s;e we &s;hall have eternal Ble&s;&s;ings in Reward for them; for 'tis in <HI>Con&s;equence of our Ju&s;ti|fication,</HI> that our good Deeds become <HI>rewardable,</HI> with &s;piritual and eternal Rewards. The acceptablene&s;s, and &s;o the rewardablene&s;s of our Vertue is not antecedent to Ju&s;tification, but follows it, and is built entirely upon it; which is the rever&s;e of what tho&s;e in the adver&s;e Scheme of Ju&s;tification &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>viz</HI> That Ju&s;tification is built on the Acceptablene&s;s and Rewardablene&s;s of our Vertue. They &s;uppo&s;e that a &s;aving Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t is given as a Reward of our Vertue, or (which is
<PB N="89" REF="004239_0096_10042BF5F44CCF28">
the &s;ame Thing,) as a Te&s;timony of God's Acceptance of our Excellency, in our Vertue. But the contrary is true; that God's re&s;pect to our Vertue, as our amiable|ne&s;s in his Sight, and his Acceptance of it as reward|able, is entirely built on our Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t already e&s;tabli&s;hed. So that that Relation to Chri&s;t, whereby Believers in Scripture Language, are &s;aid to be <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t, is the very Foundation of our Vertues, and good Deeds, being accepted of God, and &s;o of their being rewarded; for a Reward is a Te&s;timony of Acceptance. For we, and all that we do, are accepted only <HI>in the beloved,</HI> Eph 1. 6. Our Sacrifices are acceptable, only through our Intere&s;t in him, and through his Worthine&s;s, and Preciou&s;ne&s;s, being as it were made ours. 1 Pet. 2. 4 5. To whom coming <HI>as unto a living Stone, di&s;allowed in|deed of Men, but cho&s;en of God and</HI> precious; <HI>ye al&s;o as lively Stones, are built up a &s;piritual Hou&s;e, an holy Prie&s;thood, to offer up &s;piritual Sacrifices,</HI> acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Here a being actually built on this Stone, <HI>precious to God,</HI> is mentioned as all the Ground of the <HI>Acceptablene&s;s</HI> of our good Works to God, and their becoming, <HI>al&s;o precious</HI> in his Eves. So Heb. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 21. <HI>Make you perfect in every good Work, to do his Will, working in you that which is</HI> well plea&s;ing in his Sight, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t&punc; And hence we are di|rected, whatever we offer to God, to offer it in Chri&s;t's Name, as expecting to have it accepted no other Way, than from the Value that God has to that Name. Col. 3. 17. <HI>And what&s;oever ye do, in Word or Deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us, giving Thanks to God, and the Father by him</HI> To act in Chri&s;t's Name, is to act under him, as our Head, and as having him to &s;tand for us, and repre&s;ent us to God ward.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this may be &s;een, from what has been already &s;aid, to &s;hew that it is not meet that any Thing in us, &s;hould be accepted of God&punc; as any Excel|lency of our Per&s;ons, until we are actually in Chri&s;t, and ju&s;tified through him. The Loveline&s;s of the Ver|tue of fallen Creatures, is nothing in the Sight of God, till he beholds them in Chri&s;t, and clothed with his
<PB N="90" REF="004239_0097_10042BF7790BA340">
Righteou&s;ne&s;s. 1. Becau&s;e till then we &s;tand condemn|ned before God, by his own holy Law, to his utter Re|jection, and Abhorrence, And, 2. Becau&s;e we are infinitely Guilty before him, and the Loveline&s;s of our Vertue bears no Proportion to our Guilt; and mu&s;t therefore pa&s;s for nothing before a &s;trict Judge. And, 3 Becau&s;e our good Deeds, and vertuous Acts them|&s;elves, are in a Sen&s;e corrupt, and the hatefulne&s;s of the Corruption of them, if we are beheld as we are in our &s;elves, or &s;eperate from Chri&s;t, infinitely outweighs the Loveline&s;s of the Good that is in them: So that if no other Sin was con&s;idered, but only that which attends the Act of Vertue it&s;elf, the Loveline&s;s vani&s;hes into no|thing in Compari&s;on of it: And therefore the Virtue mu&s;t pa&s;s for nothing, out of Chri&s;t. Not only are our be&s;t Duties defiled, in being attended with the Exerci&s;es of Sin and Corruption, that precede them and follow them, and are <HI>intermingled with holy Acts;</HI> but even the <HI>holy Acts them&s;elves,</HI> and the gracious Exerci&s;es of the godly, tho' the Act mo&s;t &s;imply con&s;idered is good, yet take the Acts in their Mea&s;ure, and Dimen&s;ions, and the manner in which they are exerted, and they are <HI>corrupt Acts;</HI> that is, they are defectively corrupt, or &s;infully defective; there is that defect in them, that may well be called the Corruption of them; that de|fect is properly Sin, an Expre&s;&s;ion of a vile Sinfulne&s;s of Heart, and what tends to provoke the ju&s;t anger of God; not becau&s;e the Exerci&s;e of Love and other Grace, is not equal to God's loveline&s;s; for 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible the Love of Creatures (Men or Angels) &s;hould be &s;o; but becau&s;e the Act is &s;o very di&s;proportionate to the Occa&s;ion given for Love or other Grace, con&s;ider|ing God's loveline&s;s, and the Manife&s;tation that is made of it, and the exerci&s;es of Kindne&s;s, and the capacity of human Nature, and our Advantages, (and the like) together. A negative Expre&s;&s;ion of Corruption may be as truly Sin, and as ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Provocation, as a po&s;itive. Thus if a Man, a worthy &amp; excellent Per&s;on, &s;hould from meer Genero&s;ity and Goodne&s;s, exceeding|ly lay out him&s;elf, and &s;hould with great Expence and

Suffering, &s;ave another's Life, or redeem him from &s;ome extream Calamity; and when he had done all, that other Per&s;on &s;hould never thank him for it, or expre&s;s the lea&s;t Gratitude any way; this would be a negative Expre&s;&s;ion of his Ingratitude and Ba&s;ene&s;s; but is E|quivalent to an <HI>Act</HI> of Ingratitude, or <HI>po&s;itive</HI> exerci&s;e of a ba&s;e unworthy Spirit; and is truly an Expre&s;&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and brings as much Blame, as if he by &s;ome po&s;itive Act, had much injured another Per&s;on. And &s;o it would be, (only in a le&s;&s;er Degree,) if the Gratitude was but very &s;mall, bearing no Proportion to the Be|nefit and Obligation; as if for &s;o great and extraordi|nary a Kindne&s;s, he &s;hould expre&s;s no more Gratitude than would have been becoming towards a Per&s;on that had only given him a cup of Water when thir&s;ty, or &s;hewn him the Way in a Journey, when at a lo&s;s, or had done him &s;ome &s;uch &s;mall Kindne&s;s: If he &s;hould come to his Benefactor to expre&s;s his Gratitude, and &s;hould do after this manner&punc; he might truly he &s;aid to act un|worthily and odiou&s;ly; he would &s;hew a mo&s;t ungrate|ful Spirit: And his doing after &s;uch a Manner might ju&s;tly be abhorr'd by all: And yet the Gratitude, that little there is of it, mo&s;t &s;imply con&s;idered, and &s;o far as it goes, is good. And &s;o it is with re&s;pect to our exerci&s;e of Love, and Gratitude, and other Graces to|wards God, they are defectively corrupt and &s;inful, and take 'em as they are, in their Manner, and Mea&s;ure, might ju&s;tly be odious, and provoking to God, and would nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o, were we beheld out of Chri&s;t: For in that this Defect is Sin, it is <HI>infinitely hateful;</HI> and &s;o the hatefulne&s;s of the very Act, infinitely out weighs the Loveline&s;s of it; becau&s;e all Sin has infinite hate|fulne&s;s and heinou&s;ne&s;s; but our Holine&s;s has but little Value and Loveline&s;s, as has been el&s;ewhere demon&s;tra|ted.</P>
<P>Hence, tho' it be true that the Saints are rewarded for their good Works, yet it is for Chri&s;t's &s;ake only, and not for the Excellency of their Works in them&s;elves

con&s;idered, or beheld &s;eperately from Chri&s;t; for &s;o they have no excellency in God's &s;ight, or acceptablene&s;s to him, as has now been &s;hewn. 'Tis acknowledged that God in rewarding the Holine&s;s and good Works of Be|livers, does in &s;ome re&s;pect give them Happine&s;s as a Te&s;timony of his Re&s;pect to the Loveline&s;s of their Holine&s;s and good Works in his Sight; for that is the very Notion of a Reward: But in a very different Sen&s;e from what would have been&punc; if Man had not fal|len; which would have been to be&s;tow eternal Life on Man, as a Te&s;timony of God's Re&s;pect to the Loveline&s;s of what Man did, con&s;idered as in it &s;elf, and as in Man, &s;eperately by him&s;elf, and not beheld as a Member of Chri&s;t: In which Sen&s;e al&s;o, the Scheme of Ju&s;tification we are oppo&s;ing, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, the Excellency of our Virtue to be re&s;pected and rewarded; for it &s;uppo&s;es a &s;aving Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t <HI>it &s;elf</HI> to be given as a Re|ward of it.</P>
<P>Two Things come to pa&s;s, relating to the Saints Re|ward for their inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s, by Virtue of their Relation to Chri&s;t. 1. The Guilt of their Per&s;ons is all done away, and the Pollution and Hatefulne&s;s that at|tends, and <HI>is in,</HI> their good Works, is hid. 2. Their Relation to Chri&s;t adds a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> Value and Dignity to their good Works, in God's Sight. That little Holine&s;s, and tho&s;e faint and feeble Acts of Love, and other Grace, receive an exceeding Value in the Sight of God, by Vir|tue of God's beholding them as in Chri&s;t, and as it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e Members of one &s;o infinitely Worthy in his Eyes; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> becau&s;e God looks upon the <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> as Per&s;ons of greater Dignity on this Account. I&s;ai 43. 4 <HI>Since thou wa&s;t precious in my Sight, thou ha&s;t been honourable.</HI> God, for Chri&s;t's Sake, and becau&s;e they are Members of his own righteous and dear Son, &s;ets an exceeding Value upon their Per&s;ons; and hence it follows, that he all &s;ets a great Value upon their good Acts and Offerings. The &s;ame Love and Obedience, in a Per&s;on of greater Dignity and Value in God's Sight, is more valuable his Eyes, than in one of le&s;s Dignity. Love and Re&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="93" REF="004239_0100_100404B512794750">
(as has been before ob&s;erved,) is valuable, in Proportion to the Dignity of the Per&s;on, who&s;e Love it is; becau&s;e, &s;o far as any one gives his Love to another, he gives <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> in that he gives his Heart: But this is a more excellent Offering, in Proportion as the Per&s;on who&s;e <HI>&s;elf</HI> is offered, is more worthy. Believers are become immen&s;ely more honourable in God's E&s;teem, by Vir|tue of their Relation to Chri&s;t, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n Man would have been, con&s;idered as by him&s;elf, tho' he had been free from Sin; as a mean Per&s;on becomes more honourable when married to a King. Hence God will probably reward the little weak Love, and poor and exceeding imperfect Obedience of Believers in Chri&s;t, with a more glorious Reward, than he would have done <HI>Adam's</HI> perfect Obedience. According to the Tenour of the fir&s;t Covenant, the Per&s;on was to be accepted and re|warded, only for the Work's Sake; but by the Covenant of Grace, the Work is accepted and rewarded, only for the Per&s;on's Sake; the Per&s;on being beheld antecedent|ly, as a Member of Chri&s;t, and clothed with his Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. So that tho' the Saints inherent Holine&s;s is re|warded, yet this very Reward is indeed, not the le&s;s founded on the Worthine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t: None of the Value that their Works have in his Sight, nor any of the Acceptance they have with him, is out of Chri&s;t, and out of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s; but his Wor|thine&s;s as Mediator, is the prime and only Foundation on which all is built, and the univer&s;al Source whence all ari&s;es. God indeed doth great Things out of Regard to the Saints Loveline&s;s, but 'tis only as a &s;econdary and derivative Loveline&s;s, as it were.&mdash;When I &s;peak of a derivative Loveline&s;s, I don't mean only, that the <HI>Qualifications them&s;elves,</HI> that are accepted as lovely, are derived from Chri&s;t, and are from his Power and Pur|cha&s;e; but that the <HI>Acceptance of them</HI> as a Loveline&s;s, and all the Value that is &s;et upon them, and all their Connection with the Reward, is founded <HI>in,</HI> and derived <HI>from</HI> Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Worthine&s;s.</P>

If we &s;uppo&s;e that not only higher Degrees of Glory in Heaven, but Heaven it &s;elf, is in &s;ome Re&s;pect given in Reward for the Holine&s;s, and good Works of the Saints, in this &s;econdary and derivative Sen&s;e, it won't prejudice the Doctrine we have maintain'd 'Tis no Way impo&s;&s;ible that God may be&s;tow Heaven's Glory wholly out of Re&s;pect to Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and yet in Reward for Man's inherent Holine&s;s, in different Re&s;|pects, and different Ways It may be only Chri&s;t's Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, that God has re&s;pect to, for its own Sake, the independent Acceptablene&s;s, and Dignity of it being &s;ufficient of it &s;elf, to recommend all that believe in Chri&s;t, to a Title to this Glory; and &s;o it may be only by this that Per&s;ons <HI>enter</HI> into a Title to Heaven, or have their prime Right to it: And yet God may al&s;o have Re&s;pect to the Saints own Holine&s;s, <HI>for Chri&s;t's Sake,</HI> and as deriving a Value from Chri&s;t's Merit, which he may te&s;tify in be&s;towing Heaven upon them. The Saints being beheld as Members of Chri&s;t, their Obedience is looked upon by God, as &s;omething of Chri&s;t's, it being the Obedience of the Members of Chri&s;t; as the <HI>Suffer|ings</HI> of the Members of Chri&s;t, are looked upon, in &s;ome Re&s;pect, as the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of Chri&s;t. Hence the Apo&s;tle &s;peaking of his Sufferings, &s;ays Col 1. 24. <HI>Who now re|joyce in my Sufferings for you,</HI> and fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Chri&s;t in my Fle&s;h.

Our heavenly Father may already have that Favour for a Child, whereby he may be thoroughly ready to give the Child an Inheritance, <HI>becau&s;e he is his Child;</HI> which he is by the Purcha&s;e of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and yet that don't hinder but that it &s;hould be po&s;&s;ible, that the Fa|ther may choo&s;e to be&s;tow the Inheritance on the Child, in a Way of Reward for his Dutifulne&s;s, and behaving becoming a Child. And &s;o great, and exceeding a Re|ward, may not be judged more than a meet Reward for his Dutifulne&s;s, but that &s;o great a Reward <HI>is judged meet,</HI> don't ari&s;e from the Excellency of the Obedience, ab&s;olutely con&s;idered, but from his &s;tanding in &s;o near, and honourable a Relation to God, as that of a Child, <HI>which is obtained only by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI> And thus the Reward, and the Greatne&s;s of it, ari&s;es properly from the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; tho' it be indeed in &s;ome &s;ort the Reward of their Obedience. As a Father might ju&s;tly e&s;teem the Inheritance, no more than a meet Reward for the Obedience of his Child, and yet e&s;|teem it more than a meet Reward for the Obedience of a Servant. The Favour whence a Believer's heavenly Father be&s;tows the eternal Inheritance, and his Title as an Heir, is founded in that Relation he &s;tands in to him as a Child, purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s; tho' he in Wi&s;dom, choo&s;es to be&s;tow it in &s;uch a Way, as there|in to te&s;tify his Acceptance of the Amiablene&s;s of his Obedience in Chri&s;t.</P>

<P N="1">1. God looks on the&s;e glorious Benefits as a meet Te&s;timony of his Regard to the Value which their Per|&s;ons have in his Sight.

And this Value that God &s;ets upon them on this Account is &s;o great, that God thinks meet from Regard to it to admit them to &s;uch exceeding Glory The Saints on the Account of their Relation to Chri&s;t are &s;uch precious Jewels in God's Sight, that they are thought <HI>worthy</HI> of a Place in his own Crown. <HI>Mal. 3. 17.

<P>With Re&s;pect to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Part of the Objection, that relates to the different Degrees of Glory, and the &s;eeming Incon&s;i&s;tence there is in it, that the Degrees of Glory in different Saints &s;hould be greater or le&s;&s;er ac|cording to their inherent Holine&s;s and good Works, and yet that every ones Glory &s;hould be purcha&s;ed with the Price of the very &s;ame imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

Degrees of Happine&s;s,</HI> and yet all their Happine&s;s be the Fruit of Chri&s;t's Purcha&s;e. Indeed it can't be properly &s;aid that Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed any particular Degree of Happine&s;s, &s;o that the Value of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Sight of God, is &s;ufficient to rai&s;e a Believer <HI>&s;o high,</HI> in Happi|ne&s;s, and <HI>no higher;</HI> and &s;o that if the Believer were made happier, it would exceed the Value of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s: But in general, Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed eternal Life, or perfect Happine&s;s for all, according to their &s;e|veral Capacities. The Saints are as &s;o many Ve&s;&s;els, of different Sizes, ca&s;t into a Sea of Happine&s;s, where eve|ry Ve&s;&s;el is full; this Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed for all: But af|ter all 'tis left to God's &s;overeign Plea&s;ure to determine the Largene&s;s of the Ve&s;&s;el; Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s meddles not with this Matter. Eph. 4. 4. 5, 6, 7. <HI>There is one Body, and one Spirit; even as ye are called in one Hope of your Calling; one Lord, one Faith, one Bapti&s;m, &amp;c.&mdash;But unto every one of us, is given Grace accord|ing to the Mea&s;ure of the Gift of Chri&s;t.</HI> God may di&s;|pen&s;e in this Matter according to what Rule he plea&s;es, not the le&s;s for what Chri&s;t has done: He may di&s;pen&s;e either without Condition, or upon what Condition he plea&s;es to fix. 'Tis evident that Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s meddles not with this Matter; for what Chri&s;t did, was to fulfil the Covenant of Works; but the Covenant of Works did not meddle at all with this: If <HI>Adam</HI> had per|&s;ever'd in perfect Obedience, he and his Po&s;terity would have had perfect and full Happine&s;s; every ones Hap|pine&s;s would have &s;o an&s;wer'd his Capacity, that he would have been compleatly ble&s;&s;ed; but God would have been at Liberty to have made &s;ome of one Capa|city, and others of another as he plea&s;ed. The Angels have obtained eternal Life, or a State of confirmed Glo|ry by a Covenant of Works, who&s;e Condition was per|fect Obedience; but yet &s;ome are higher in Glory than others, according to the &s;everal Capacity that God, ac|cording to his &s;overeign Plea&s;ure, hath given them.

If it had been but one Man, that Chri&s;t had obeyed and died for, and it had plea&s;ed God to make him of a very large Capacity, Chri&s;t's perfect Obedience would have purcha&s;ed that his Capacity &s;hould be fill'd, and then <HI>all</HI> his Happine&s;s might properly be &s;aid to be the Fruit of Chri&s;t's perfect Obedience; though if he had been of a le&s;s Capacity, he would not have had <HI>&s;o much</HI> Happine&s;s, by the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Obedience; and yet would had as much as Chri&s;t merited for him. Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s meddles not with the Degree of Happi|ne&s;s, any otherwi&s;e than as he merits that it &s;hould be full, and perfect, according to the Capacity: And &s;o it may be &s;aid to be concern'd in the Degree of Happine&s;s, as <HI>perfect</HI> is a Degree, with Re&s;pect to <HI>imperfect;</HI> but it meddles not with Degrees of perfect Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>This Matter may be yet better under&s;tood, if we con|&s;ider that Chri&s;t and the whole Church of Saints, are as it were, one Body, of which he is the Head and they Members, of different Place and Capacity: Now the whole Body, Head and Members, have Communion in Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, they are all Partakers of the Be|nefit of it; Chri&s;t him&s;elf the Head is rewarded for it, and every Member is Partaker of the Benefit and Re|ward: But it does by no Means follow, that every Part &s;hould equally partake of the Benefit; but every Part in Proportion to its Place and Capacity; the Head par|takes of far more than other Parts, becau&s;e it is of a far greater Capacity; and the more noble Members partake of more than the Inferiour. As it is in a natural Body that enjoys perfect Health, the Head, and the Heart, and Lungs have a greater Share of this Health, they have it more &s;eated in them, than the Hands and Feet, becau&s;e they are Parts of greater Capacity; tho' the Hands and Feet are as much in perfect Health as tho&s;e nobler

Parts of the Body: So it is in the my&s;tical Body of Chri&s;t, all the Members are Partakers of the Benefit of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Head; but 'tis according to the different Capacity and Place they have in the Body; and God determines that Place &amp; Capacity as he plea&s;es; he makes whom he plea&s;es the Foot, and whom he plea&s;es the Hand, and whom he plea&s;es the Lungs, &amp;c. 1 Cor. 12 18 <HI>God hath &s;et the Members, every one of them, in the Body, as it hath plea&s;ed him.</HI> And God <HI>ef|ficaciou&s;ly</HI> determines the Place, and Capacity of every Member, by the different Degrees of Grace, and A&s;&s;i&s;|tance in the Improvement of it, here in this World: Tho&s;e that he intends for the highe&s;t Place in the Body, he gives them mo&s;t of his Spirit, the greate&s;t Share of the divine Nature, the Spirit and Nature of Chri&s;t Je&s;us <HI>the Head,</HI> and that A&s;&s;i&s;tance whereby they perform the mo&s;t excellent Works, and do mo&s;t abound in them.</P>

<P>And therefore, in An&s;wer to the Objection, I would &s;ay, That when Repentance is &s;poken of in Scripture as the Condition of Pardon, thereby is not intended any particular Grace, or Act, properly di&s;tinct from Faith, that has a parallel Influence with it, in the Affair of our Pardon or Ju&s;tification; but by Repentance is in|tended nothing di&s;tinct from active Conver&s;ion, (or Conver&s;ion actively con&s;idered,) as it re&s;pects the <HI>Term from which.</HI> Active Conver&s;ion is a Motion or Exerci&s;e of the Mind, that re&s;pects two <HI>Terms, viz.</HI> Sin and God: And by Repentance is meant this Conver&s;ion, or active Change of the Mind, &s;o far as it is conver&s;ant about the <HI>Term from which,</HI> or about <HI>Sin&punc;</HI> This is what the Word <HI>Repentance</HI> properly &s;ignifies; which in the Ori|ginal of the New Te&s;tament is <HI>Metanoia</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>a Change of the Mind,</HI> or which is the &s;ame Thing, the turning or the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of the Mind. Repentance is this turning, as it re&s;pects what is turned from Acts 26. 20. <HI>Whereupon, O King</HI> Agrippa, <HI>I &s;hewed unto them of</HI> Dama&s;cus, <HI>and at</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and throughout all the Coa&s;ts of</HI> Judea, <HI>and then to the Gentiles, that they &s;hould</HI> repent and turn to God&punc; Both the&s;e are the &s;ame turn|ing, but only with Re&s;pect to oppo&s;ite <HI>Terms;</HI> in the former is expre&s;s'd the Exerci&s;e of Mind that there is about Sin in this Turning, in the other the Exerci&s;e of Mind towards God.</P>

Con|ver&s;ion is the Condition of Ju&s;tification, becau&s;e it is that great Change by which we are brought from Sin to Chri&s;t, and by which we become Believers in him: Agreeable to Matth. 21. 32. <HI>And ye when ye had &s;een it,</HI> repented <HI>not afterwards</HI> that ye might believe him. When we are directed to repent that our Sins may be blotted out, 'tis as much as to &s;ay, Let your Minds and Hearts be changed that your Sins may be blotted out: But if it be &s;aid, <HI>Let your Hearts be changed</HI> that you may be ju&s;tified; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o &s;aid, <HI>Believe</HI> that you may be ju&s;tified; does it therefore follow that the Heart's being changed is one Condition of Ju&s;tification, and Be|lieving another?

<P>And be&s;ides, evangelical Repentance, being active Conver&s;ion, is not to be treated of as a particular Grace, properly and entirely di&s;tinct from Faith, as by &s;ome it &s;eems to have been.

Soul that there is in Conver&s;ion, that re&s;pects Sin, can|not be excluded out of the Nature of Faith in Chri&s;t: There is &s;omething in Faith, or clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t that re&s;pects Sin, and that is evangelical Repentance: That Repentance which in Scripture is called <HI>Repentance for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins,</HI> is that very Principle or Operation of the Mind it &s;elf, that i called Faith, &s;o far as it is conver&s;ant about Sin. Ju&s;tifying Faith in a Mediator, is conver&s;ant about two Things: It is conver&s;ant about Sin or <HI>Evil,</HI> to be rejected and to be delivered from by the Mediator, and about <HI>po&s;itive Good</HI> to be accepted and obtained by the Mediator; as conver&s;ant about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he former of the&s;e, it is <HI>evangelical Repentance</HI> or <HI>Repen|tance for Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI> Surely they mu&s;t be very <HI>ignorant,</HI> or at lea&s;t very <HI>incon&s;iderate,</HI> of the whole Te|nour of the Go&s;pel, that think that that Repentance by which Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins is obtained, can be compleated, as to all that is e&s;&s;ential to it, without any Re&s;pect to Chri&s;t, or Application of the Mind to the Mediator, who alone has made <HI>Atonement for Sin:</HI> Surely &s;o great a Part of <HI>Salvation</HI> as Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, is not to be ob|tained, without looking, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the great and only <HI>Saviour.</HI> 'Tis true Repentance in its more gene|ral ab&s;tracted Nature, is only a Sorrow for Sin, and for|&s;aking of it, which is a Duty of <HI>natural Religion;</HI> but <HI>evangelical Repentance,</HI> or Repentance for Remi&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Sins, hath more than this e&s;&s;ential to it; a Dependance of Soul on the Mediator for Deliverance from Sin is of the E&s;&s;ence of it.</P>
<P>That ju&s;tifying Repentance has the Nature of Faith &s;eems evident by Acts 19 4. <HI>Then &s;aid Paul, John veri|ly bapti&s;ed with the Bapti&s;m of Repentance, &s;aying unto the People, that they &s;hould believe on him that &s;hould come after him, that is on Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> The latter Words, <HI>Saying unto the People, that they &s;hould believe on him</HI> &amp;c. are evidently exegetical of the former, and explain how he <HI>preached Repentance for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins:</HI> When it is &s;aid that he preached Repentance for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sin, &s;aying that they &s;hould believe on Chri&s;t, it can't be &s;uppo&s;ed but that 'tis intended, that his &s;aying that
<PB N="107" REF="004239_0114_10042C14F11C9220">
they &s;hould believe on Chri&s;t, was as directing them what to do that they might obtain the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins. So 2 Tim. 2. 25. <HI>In Meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that op|po&s;e them&s;elves, if God peradventure will give them</HI> Re|pentance, to the acknowleging of the Truth. That acknowleging of the Truth which there is in Believing, is here &s;poken of as what is attained in Repentance. And on the other Hand, that Faith includes Repen|tance in its Nature, is evident by the Apo&s;tle's &s;peaking of Sin as <HI>de&s;troyed in Faith,</HI> Gal. 2. 18. In the pre|ceeding Ver&s;es, the Apo&s;tle mentions an Objection a|gain&s;t the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, <HI>viz.</HI> that it tends to encourage Men in Sin, and &s;o to make Chri&s;t the Mini&s;ter of Sin: This Objection he rejects and refu&s;es with this, <HI>If I build again the Things that I de&s;troyed, I make my &s;elf a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or.</HI> If Sin be de&s;troyed by Faith, it mu&s;t be by Repentance of Sin included in it; for we know that it is our Repentance of Sin, or the <HI>Metanoia,</HI> or turning of the Mind from Sin, that is our de&s;troying our Sin.</P>
<P>That in ju&s;tifying Faith, that directly re&s;pects <HI>Sin,</HI> or <HI>the Evil to be delivered from</HI> by the Mediator, is as fol|lows, <HI>A Sen&s;e of our own Sinfulne&s;s, and the Hatefulne&s;s of it, and an hearty Acknowlegement of its De&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the threaten'd Puni&s;hment, looking to the free Mercy of God in a Redeemer, for Deliverance from it and its Puni&s;h|ment.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning this, here de&s;cribed, three Things may be noted, 1. That 'tis the very &s;ame with that evangelical Repentance to which Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins is promi&s;ed in Scripture. 2. That 'tis all of it of the E&s;&s;ence of ju&s;|tifying Faith, and is the &s;ame with that Faith, &s;o far as it is conver&s;ant about <HI>the Evil to be delivered from</HI> by the Mediator. 3 That this is indeed the proper and peculiar Condition of Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>All of it is e&s;&s;ential to evangelical Repentance, and is indeed the very Thing meant by that Repentance, to which Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins is promi&s;ed in the Go&s;pel.</HI> As to the former Part of the De&s;cription, <HI>viz A Sen&s;e of our own Sinfulne&s;s, and the Hatefulne&s;s of it, and an hearty

Acknowlegement of its De&s;ert of Wrath,</HI> none will deny it to be included in Repentance: But this don't compre|hend the whole E&s;&s;ence of evangelical Repentance; but what follows does al&s;o properly and e&s;&s;entially be|long to its Nature, <HI>looking to the free Mercy of God in a Redeemer, for Deliverance from it, and the Puni&s;hment of it.</HI> That Repentance to which Remi&s;&s;ion is promi&s;ed not only always has this <HI>with it,</HI> but it is contained <HI>in</HI> it, as what is of the proper Nature and E&s;&s;ence of it: And Re&s;pect is ever had to <HI>this</HI> in the Nature of Re|pentance, whenever Remi&s;&s;ion is promi&s;ed to it; and it is e&s;pecially from Re&s;pect to this in the Nature of Re|pentance, that it has that Promi&s;e made to it: If this latter Part be mi&s;&s;ing, it fails of the Nature of that evan|gelical Repentance to which Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins is pro|mi&s;ed: If Repentance remains in Sorrow for Sin, and don't reach to a looking to the free Mercy of God in Chri&s;t for Pardon, 'tis not that which is the Condition of Pardon, neither &s;hall Pardon be obtained by it Evan|gelical Repentance is an Humiliation for Sin <HI>before God;</HI> but the Sinner never comes and humbles him&s;elf before God, in any other Repentance, but that which includes an hoping in his Mercy for Remi&s;&s;ion: If his Sorrow be not accompanied with that, there will be no coming to God in it, but a flying further from him. There is &s;ome Wor&s;hip of God in ju&s;tifying Repentance; but that there is not in any other Repentance, but that which has a Sen&s;e <HI>of,</HI> and Faith <HI>in</HI> the divine Mercy to forgive Sin. P&s;alm 130 4. <HI>There is Forgivene&s;s with thee, that thou may&s;t be feared.</HI> The Promi&s;e of Mercy to a true Penitent, in Prov. 28. 13. is expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e Terms, <HI>Who&s;o confe&s;&s;eth, and for&s;aketh his Sins, &s;hall have Mercy.</HI> But there is Faith in God's Mercy in that <HI>confe&s;&s;ing.</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t in P&s;alm 32 &s;peaking of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the Men who&s;e Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is forgiven, and who&s;e Sin is co|vered, to whom the Lord imputes not Sin,</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>while he kept Silence, his Bones waxed old, but then he acknow|leged his Sin unto God, his Iniquity he did not hide, he &s;aid he would confe&s;s his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion to the Lord, and then God forgave the Iniquity of his Sin.</HI> The Manner of
<PB N="109" REF="004239_0116_100404952CA16E28">
Expre&s;&s;ion plainly holds forth that then he began to en|courage him&s;elf in the Mercy of God, when before his Bones waxed old, while he kept Silence; and therefore the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in the 4 of <HI>Romans</HI> brings this In|&s;tance, to confirm the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification <HI>by Faith</HI> alone, that he had been in&s;i&s;ting on. When Sin is a|right confe&s;s'd to God, there is always Faith in that Act: That confe&s;&s;ing of Sin that is join'd with De&s;pair, &s;uch as was in <HI>Judas,</HI> is not the Confe&s;&s;ion to which the pro|mi&s;e is made. In Acts 2. 38. the Direction that was given to tho&s;e that were pricked in their Heart, with a Sen&s;e of the Guilt of Sin, was to <HI>repent &amp; be bapti&s;ed in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the Remi&s;&s;ion of their Sins.</HI> A being <HI>bapti&s;ed in the Name of Chri&s;t</HI> for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, implied <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t</HI> for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins. Repentance for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, was typifi|ed of old by the Prie&s;ts confe&s;&s;ing the Sins of the Peo|ple over the Scape-Goat, laying his Hands on him, <HI>Lev. 16. 21.</HI> denoting that 'tis that Repentance and Confe&s;|&s;ion of Sin only that obtains Remi&s;&s;ion, that is made o|ver the Scape-Goat, over Chri&s;t the great Sacrifice, and with Dependance on him. Many other Things might be produced from the Scripture, that do in like manner confirm this Point, but the&s;e may be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>All the foremention'd De&s;cription is of the E&s;&s;ence of ju&s;tifying Faith, and not different from it, &s;o far as it is conver&s;ant about Sin, or the Evil to be deliver'd from, by the Mediator.</HI> For it is doubtle&s;s of the E&s;&s;ence of ju&s;ti|fying Faith, to <HI>embrace Chri&s;t as a Saviour from Sin and its Puni&s;hment,</HI> and all that is contain'd in <HI>that Act</HI> is contain'd in <HI>the Nature of Faith it &s;elf:</HI> But in <HI>the Act</HI> of embracing Chri&s;t as a Saviour from <HI>our Sin</HI> and its <HI>Puni&s;hment,</HI> is implied a Sen&s;e of <HI>our Sinfulne&s;s,</HI> and a Hatred of <HI>our Sins,</HI> or a rejecting them with Abhorrence, and a Sen&s;e of our De&s;ert of their <HI>Puni&s;hment.</HI> An <HI>em|bracing</HI> Chri&s;t as a Saviour from Sin implies the contrary Act towards Sin, <HI>viz. rejecting</HI> of Sin: If we fly to the Light to be delivered from Darkne&s;s, the &s;ame Act is contrary towards Darkne&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> a rejecting of it.

It implies <HI>a Sen&s;e of our own Sinfulne&s;s:</HI> Certainly in the hearty embracing a Saviour from the Puni&s;hment of our Sinfulne&s;s, there is the Exerci&s;e of a <HI>Sen&s;e of our Sinfulne&s;s,</HI> or that we be &s;inful: We can't heartily embrace Chri&s;t as a Sa|viour from the Puni&s;hment of that which we are not &s;en&s;ible we are guilty of.

And further, there is implied in a hearty embracing Chri&s;t as a Saviour from Puni&s;hment, not only a Conviction of Con&s;cience, that we have de&s;er|ved the Puni&s;hment, &s;uch as the Devils and Damned have; but there is a hearty Acknowlegement of it, with the Submi&s;&s;ion of the Soul, &s;o as with the Accord of the Heart, to own that God might be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and <HI>wor|thy</HI> in the Puni&s;hment. If the Heart ri&s;es again&s;t the Act or Judgment of God, in holding us obliged to the Puni&s;hment, when he offers us his Son as a Saviour from the Puni&s;hment, we cannot with the Con&s;ent of the Heart receive him in that Character: But if Per&s;ons thus &s;ubmit to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of &s;o dreadful a Pu|ni&s;hment of Sin, this carries in it an Hatred of Sin.</P>

<P>It may be objected here, that the Scripture &s;ometimes mentions Faith and Repentance together, as if they were entirely di&s;tinct Things; as in Mark 1. 15 <HI>Re|pent ye, and believe the Go&s;pel.</HI> But there is no need of under&s;tanding the&s;e as two di&s;tinct Conditions of Salva|tion, but the Words are exegetical one of another: It is to teach us after what Manner we mu&s;t repent, <HI>viz.</HI> as believing the Go&s;pel, and after what Manner we mu&s;t believe the Go&s;pel, <HI>viz.</HI> as repenting: The&s;e Words no more prove Faith and Repentance to be entirely di&s;tinct, than tho&s;e forementioned Matth. 21. 32 <HI>And ye when ye had &s;een it, repented not afterwards, that ye might believe him.</HI> Or tho&s;e 2 Tim. 2. 25. <HI>If peradven|ture God will give them Repentance, to the acknowleging of the Truth.</HI> The Apo&s;tle in <HI>Acts</HI> 19 4 &s;eems to have Reference to the&s;e Words of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t, John bapti&s;ed with the Bapti&s;m of Repentance, &s;aying unto the People, that they &s;hould believe,</HI> &amp;c. where the latter Words&punc; as we have already ob&s;erved, are to explain how he preached Repentance.</P>

<P>And the Rea&s;on may be plain from what has been &s;aid.

Yea this rejecting Evil, is it &s;elf an Act of Ac|ceptance; 'tis accepting Freedom or Seperation from that Evil; and this Freedom or Seperation is the Bene|fit be&s;towed in Remi&s;&s;ion. No Wonder that that in Faith which immediately re&s;pects this Benefit, and is our Acceptance of this Benefit, &s;hould be the &s;pecial Condition of our having it: 'Tis &s;o with Re&s;pect to all the Benefits that Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed.

<P N="2">2.

Not that the very Works or Actions done are properly the Life of Faith, as the Spirit in the Body; but 'tis the <HI>active, working Nature</HI> of Faith, of which the Actions or Works done are the Signs, that is it &s;elf the Life and Spirit of Faith. The Sign of a Thing is often in Scripture Language &s;aid to be that Thing. As it is in that Compari&s;on by which the Apo&s;tle illu&s;|trates it. 'Tis not the Actions them&s;elves of a Body, that is properly the Life or Spirit of the Body; but 'tis the <HI>active Nature,</HI> of which tho&s;e Actions or Motions are the Signs, that are the Life of the Body. That which makes Men call any Thing alive, is that they ob&s;erve that it has an active operative Nature in it; which they ob&s;erve no otherwi&s;e than by the Actions or Motions that are the Signs of it. 'Tis plainly the Apo&s;tle's Aim to prove that Works are nece&s;&s;ary from that, That if Faith hath not Works, 'tis a <HI>Sign</HI> that 'tis not a good Sort of Faith; which would not have been to his Pur|po&s;e, if it was his De&s;ign to &s;hew that it is not by Faith alone, <HI>tho' of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight Sort,</HI> that we have Acceptance with God, but that we are accepted on the Account of Obedience <HI>as well as</HI> Faith. 'Tis evident by the Apo|&s;tle's Rea&s;oning, that the Nece&s;&s;ity of Works that he &s;peaks of, is not as having a <HI>parallel</HI> Concern in our Salvation with Faith; but he &s;peaks of Works only as <HI>related to Faith,</HI> and <HI>expre&s;&s;ive of it;</HI> which after all leaves Faith the <HI>alone fundamental</HI> Condition, with|out any Thing el&s;e having a parallel Concern with it in this Affair, and other Things Conditions, only as &s;e|veral Expre&s;&s;ions, and Evidences of it.</P>
<P>That the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of Works ju&s;tifying only as a <HI>Sign,</HI> or <HI>Evidence,</HI> and in God's <HI>declarative Judgment,</HI> is further confirmed by Ver&s;e 21. <HI>Was not Abraham our Father ju&s;tified by Works, when he had offered up I&s;aac his Son upon the Altar?</HI> Here the Apo&s;tle &s;eems plainly to refer to that <HI>declarative Judgment</HI> of God, concern|ing <HI>Abraham&punc;</HI> Sincerity, manife&s;ted to him, for the

Expre&s;&s;ion of that Approbation, what has been already &s;aid concerning the Manner in which Acts of evangeli|cal Obedience are concerned in the Affair of our Ju&s;tifi|cation, affords a very ea&s;y, clear, and full An&s;wer: For if we take Works as Acts or Expre&s;&s;ions of Faith, they are not excluded; &s;o a Man is not ju&s;tified by Faith only, but al&s;o by Works; i. e. he is not ju&s;tified only by Faith as a Principle in the Heart, or in its fir&s;t and more immanent Acts, but al&s;o by the effective Acts of it in Life, which are the Expre&s;&s;ions of the Life of Faith, as the Operations and Actions of the Body are of the Life of that; agreable to <HI>Ver&s;e 26.</HI></P>
<P>What has been &s;aid in An&s;wer to the&s;e Objections, may al&s;o, I hope, abundantly &s;erve for an An&s;wer to that Objection, that is often made again&s;t this Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> That it encourages Licentiou&s;ne&s;s in Life. For, from what has been &s;aid, we may &s;ee, that the Scripture Doc|trine of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, without any Manner of Goodne&s;s or Excellency of ours, does in no wi&s;e di|mini&s;h, either the Nece&s;&s;ity, or Benefit of a &s;incere evan|gelical univer&s;al Obedience: In that Man's Salvation is not only indi&s;&s;olubly connected with it, and Damnation with the Want of it, in tho&s;e that have Opportunity for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, but that it depends upon it in many Re&s;pects; as 'tis the Way to it, and the nece&s;&s;ary Preparation for it, and al&s;o as eternal Ble&s;&s;ings are be&s;towed in Reward for it, and as our Ju&s;tification in our own Con&s;ciences, and at the Day of Judgment, depends on it, as the proper Evidence of our acceptable State, and that, even in accepting of us as intitled to Life in our Ju&s;tification, God has Re&s;pect to this, as that on which the Fitne&s;s of &s;uch an Act of Ju&s;tification depends: So that our Salvation does as tru|ly depend upon it, as if we were ju&s;tified for the moral Excellency of it. And be&s;ides all this, the Degree of our Happine&s;s to all Eternity is &s;u&s;pended on, and de|termined by the Degree of this. So that this Go&s;pel.

I come now to the</P>
<P>V. and la&s;t Thing propo&s;ed, which is to con&s;ider the <HI>Importance of this Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>I know there are many that make as tho' this Contro|ver&s;y was of no great Importance; that it is chiefly a Matter of nice Speculation, depending on certain &s;ubtil Di&s;tinctions, which many that make u&s;e of them don't under&s;tand them&s;elves; and that the Difference is not of &s;uch Con&s;equence, as to be worth the being zealous about; and that more Hurt is done by rai&s;ing Di&s;putes about it, than good.</P>
<P>Indeed I am far from thinking that it is of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity that Per&s;ons &s;hould under&s;tand, and be agreed upon, all the Di&s;tinctions needful particularly to ex|plain and defend this Doctrine, again&s;t all Cavils and Objections; (tho' all Chri&s;tians &s;hould &s;trive after an Increa&s;e of Knowlege; and none &s;hould content them|&s;elves without &s;ome clear and di&s;tinct Under&s;tanding in this Point:) But that we &s;hould believe in the Gene|ral, according to the clear and abundant Revelations of God's Word, that 'tis none of our own Excellency, Vir|tue, or Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that is the Ground of our being received from a State of Condemnation into a State of Acceptance in God's Sight, but only Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Worthine&s;s, received by Faith. This I think to be of great Importance, at lea&s;t in Appli|cation to our &s;elves; and that for the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Scripture treats of this Doctrine, as a Doctrine of very great Importance. That <HI>there is</HI> a certain Doc|trine of Ju&s;tification by Faith, in Oppo&s;ition to Ju&s;tifi|cation by the Works of the Law, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in&s;i&s;ts upon as of the greate&s;t Importance, none will de|ny; becau&s;e there is nothing in the Bible more apparent. The Apo&s;tle under the infallible Conduct of the Spirit of God, thought it worth his mo&s;t &s;trenuous and <HI>zealous</HI> di&s;puting about and defending. He &s;peaks of the con|trary Doctrine as fatal and ruinous to the Souls of Men, in the latter End of the ninth Chapter of <HI>Romans,</HI> and beginning of the tenth. He &s;peaks of it as <HI>&s;ubver&s;ive of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> and calls it <HI>another Go&s;pel,</HI> and
<PB N="124" REF="004239_0131_1004049BA5DD6BA0">
&s;ays concerning it, if any one, <HI>though an Angel from Hea|ven preach it, let him be accur&s;ed.</HI> Gal 1. 6, 7, 8, 9. com|pared with the following Part of the Epi&s;tle. Certainly we mu&s;t allow the Apo&s;tles to be good Judges of the Importance and Tendency of Doctrines; at lea&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t in them&punc; And doubtle&s;s we are &s;afe, and in no Danger of Har&s;hne&s;s and Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, if we on|ly follow him, and keep clo&s;e to his expre&s;s Teachings, in what we believe and &s;ay of the hurtful and pernici|ous Tendency of any Error.&mdash;Why are we to blame, or to be cried out of, for &s;aying what the Bible has taught us to &s;ay, or for believing what the Holy Gho&s;t has taught us to that End that we might believe it?</P>
<P N="2">2. The adver&s;e Scheme lays another Foundation of Man's Salvation than God hath laid. I don't now &s;peak of that ineffectual <HI>Redemption</HI> that they &s;uppo&s;e to be univer&s;al, and what all Mankind are equally the Subjects of; but, I &s;ay, it lays intirely another Foundation of Man's <HI>actual, di&s;criminating</HI> Salvation, or that Salvation where|in true Chri&s;tians differ from wicked Men. We &s;uppo&s;e the Foundation of this to be Chri&s;t's Worthine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s: On the contrary, that Scheme &s;uppo&s;es it to be Men's own Virtue; even &s;o, that this is the Ground of a &s;aving Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t it &s;elf. It takes away Chri&s;t out of the Place of the bottom Stone, and puts in Men's own Virtue in the Room of him: So that Chri&s;t him&s;elf in the Affair of di&s;tingui&s;hing actual Salvation, is <HI>laid upon</HI> this Foundation. And the Foun|dation being &s;o different, I leave it to every one to judge whether the Difference between the two Schemes con|&s;i&s;ts only in <HI>Punctilios</HI> of &s;mall Con&s;equence. The Foundations being contrary makes the whole Scheme exceeding Diver&s;e and Oppo&s;ite; the one is a <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> Scheme, the other a <HI>legal</HI> one.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis in this Doctrine, that the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Differ|ence lies, between the Convenant of Grace, and the fir&s;t Covenant. The adver&s;e Scheme of Ju&s;tification &s;uppo|&s;es that we are ju&s;tified by our Works, in the very &s;ame Sen&s;e wherein Man was to have been ju&s;tified by his Works under the fir&s;t Covenant. By that Covenant
<PB N="125" REF="004239_0132_10042C48D75FCB90">
our fir&s;t Parents were not to have had eternal Life given them, for any <HI>proper Merit</HI> in their Obedience; becau&s;e their perfect Obedience was a Debt that they owed God: Nor was it to be be&s;towed for any <HI>Proportion</HI> between the Dignity of their Obedience, and the Value of the Reward; but only it was to be be&s;towed from a Regard to a moral Fitne&s;s in the Virtue of their Obedience, to the Reward of God's Favour; and a Title to eternal Life was to be given them, as a Te&s;timony of God's Plea&s;edne&s;s with their Works, or his Regard to the inherent Beauty of their Virtue. And &s;o it is the very &s;ame Way that tho&s;e in the adver&s;e Scheme &s;uppo&s;e that we are received into God's &s;pecial Favour now, and to tho&s;e &s;aving Benefits that are the Te&s;timonies of it. I am &s;en&s;ible the Divines of that Side, intirely di&s;claim the popi&s;h Doctrine of Merit; and are free to &s;peak of our utter Unworthine&s;s, and the great Imperfection of all our Services: But after all, 'tis our Virtue as imper|fect as it is, that recommends Men to God, by which good Men come to have a &s;aving Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and God's Favour, rather than others; and the&s;e Things are be&s;towed in Te&s;timony of God's Re&s;pect to their Goodne&s;s. So that whether they will allow the Term <HI>Merit</HI> or no, yet they hold that we are accepted by our own <HI>Merit,</HI> in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, tho' not in the &s;ame De|gree, as under the fir&s;t Covenant.</P>
<P>But the great and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing Difference be|tween that Covenant, and the Covenant of Grace is, that by the Covenant of Grace we are not thus ju&s;tified by our own Works, but only by Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. 'Tis on this Account chiefly that the new Covenant de|&s;erves the Name of a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> as is evident by Rom 4 16 <HI>Therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace.</HI> And, Chap. 3 20, 24 <HI>Therefore by the Deeds of the Law there &s;hall no Fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his Sight;&mdash;Being ju&s;tified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And, Chap. 11. 6. <HI>And if by Grace, then it is no more of Works, otherwi&s;e Grace is no more Grace: But if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace, otherwi&s;e Work is no more Work.</HI> Gal. 5 4 <HI>Who|&s;oever

of you are ju&s;tified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace.</HI> And therefore the Apo&s;tle when he in the &s;ame Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> &s;peaks of the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Works as another Go&s;pel, he adds, <HI>which is not another,</HI> Chap 1. Ver&s;e 6, 7. 'Tis <HI>no Go&s;|pel at all;</HI> 'tis Law: 'Tis no Covenant of <HI>Grace,</HI> but of <HI>Works:</HI> 'Tis not an <HI>evangelical,</HI> but a <HI>legal</HI> Doctrine. Certainly that Doctrine wherein con&s;i&s;ts the greate&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Difference between the Covenant of Grace and the fir&s;t Covenant, mu&s;t be a Doctrine of great Importance. That Doctrine of the Go&s;pel by which above all others it is worthy of the Name of <HI>Go&s;|pel,</HI> is doubtle&s;s a very important Doctrine <HI>of the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 This is the main Thing that fallen Men &s;tood in Need of divine Revelation for, to teach us how we that have &s;inn'd, may come to be again accepted of God; or which is the &s;ame Thing, <HI>How the Sinner may be ju&s;ti|fied</HI> Something beyond the Light of Nature is nece&s;&s;a|ry to Salvation, chiefly on this Account. Meer natural Rea&s;on afforded no Means by which we could come to the Knowledge of this, it depending on the &s;overeign Plea&s;ure of the Being that we had offended by Sin. This &s;eems to be the great Drift of that Revelation that God has given, &amp; of all tho&s;e My&s;teries it reveals, all tho&s;e great Doctrines that are peculiarly Doctrines of Revelation, and above the Light of Nature. It &s;eems to have been very much on this Account that it was requi&s;ite that the Doctrine of the <HI>Trinity</HI> it &s;elf &s;hould be revealed to us; that by a Di&s;covery of the Concern of the &s;everal divine Per&s;ons, in the great Affair of our Salvation, we might the better under&s;tand and &s;ee how all our Dependence in this Affair is on God, and our Sufficiency all in him, and not in our &s;elves; that he is all in all in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, agreable to that in 1 Cor. 1. 29, 30, 31. <HI>That no Fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his Pre&s;ence: But of him, are ye in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God, is made unto us, Wi&s;|dom. &amp; Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Sanctification, and Redemption.

<P N="5">5. The contrary Scheme of Ju&s;tification derogates much from the Honour of God, and the Mediator.

Gal 2 21. <HI>If Righteou&s;ne&s;s come by the Law, Chri&s;t is dead in vain.</HI> It has al&s;o been already &s;hewn, how it dimini&s;hes the Glory of divine Grace; (which is the Attribute God hath e&s;pecially &s;et him&s;elf to glorify in the Work of Redemption;) and &s;o that it greatly dimini&s;hes the Ob|ligation to Gratitude in the Sinner that is &s;aved: Yea that, in the Sen&s;e of the Apo&s;tle, it makes void the di&s;|tingui&s;hing Grace of the Go&s;pel. Gal. 5 4. <HI>Who&s;oever of you are ju&s;tified by the Law, are fallen from Grace.</HI> It dimini&s;hes the Glory of the Grace of God and the Re|deemer, and proportionably magnifies Man: It makes him <HI>&s;omething</HI> before God, when indeed he is <HI>nothing:</HI> It makes the Goodne&s;s and Excellency of fallen Man to be &s;omething, which I have &s;hewn are nothing I have al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> already &s;hewn that 'tis contrary to the Truth of God in the Threatning of his holy Law, to ju&s;tify the Sinner for <HI>his</HI> Virtue.

be&s;towing his Son and him&s;elf upon him, as it were &s;ets all this to Sale, for the Price of <HI>his</HI> Virtue and Excellen|cy. I know that tho&s;e that we oppo&s;e do acknowlege that the Price is very di&s;proportionate to the Benefit be&s;towed; and &s;ay that God's Grace is wonderfully manife&s;ted in accepting &s;o little Virtue, and be&s;towing &s;o glorious a Reward, for &s;uch imperfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s.

<P N="6">6. The oppo&s;ite Scheme does mo&s;t directly tend to lead Men to tru&s;t in their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s for Ju&s;ti|fication, which is a Thing fatal to the Soul. This is what Men are of them&s;elves exceeding prone to do, (and that tho' they are never &s;o much taught the con|trary) through the exceeding partial and high Thoughts they have of them&s;elves, and their exceeding Dulne&s;s of apprehending any &s;uch My&s;tery, as our being accept|ed for the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of another. But this Scheme does <HI>directly teach Men</HI> to tru&s;t in their own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s for Ju&s;tification; in that it teaches them that this
<PB N="129" REF="004239_0136_10042C5E8237EAB8">
is indeed what they mu&s;t be ju&s;tified by, being the Way of Ju&s;tification that God him&s;elf has appointed So that if a Man had naturally no Di&s;po&s;ition to tru&s;t in his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet if he embraced this Scheme, and act|ed con&s;i&s;tent with it, it would lead him to it. But that tru&s;ting in our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is a Thing fatal to the Soul, is what the Scripture plainly teaches us: It tells us that it will cau&s;e that Chri&s;t &s;hall profit us nothing, and be of no Effect to us, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 2, 3, 4. For tho' the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks there particularly of Circumci|&s;ion, yet (I have &s;hown already, that) it is not meerly being circumci&s;ed, but tru&s;ting in Circumci&s;ion as a Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, that the Apo&s;tle has Re&s;pect to. He could not mean that meerly being circumci&s;ed would render Chri&s;t of no Profit or Effect to a Per&s;on; for we read that he him&s;elf for certain Rea&s;ons, took <HI>Timothy</HI> and circumci&s;ed him, <HI>Acts</HI> 16 3. And the &s;ame is evident by the Context, and by the Re&s;t of the Epi&s;tle. And the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of tru&s;ting in their own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, as fatal to the <HI>Jews,</HI> Rom. 9 31, 32. <HI>But I&s;rael, which followed after the Law of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, hath not attained to the Law of Righteou&s;ne&s;s: Wherefore? Be|cau&s;e they &s;ought it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law; for they &s;tumbled at that &s;tumbling Stone.</HI> Together with Chap. 10. Ver&s;e 3. <HI>For they be|ing ignorant of God's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, have not &s;ubmitted them|&s;elves unto the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God</HI> And this is &s;poken of as fatal to the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> in the Parable of the <HI>Pha|ri&s;ee</HI> and the <HI>Publican,</HI> that Chri&s;t &s;pake to them, to re|prove them for <HI>tru&s;ting in them&s;elves, that they were Righteous.</HI> The De&s;ign of the Parable is to &s;hew them that the very Publicans &s;hall be ju&s;tified, <HI>rather than they;</HI> as appears by the Reflection Chri&s;t makes upon it, Luke 18. 14 <HI>I tell you this Man went down to his Hou&s;e ju&s;tified, rather than the other</HI> That is, this and not the other.&mdash;The fatal Tendency of it might al&s;o be proved from its Incon&s;i&s;tence with the Nature of ju&s;tifying Faith, and al&s;o its Incon&s;i&s;tence with the Na|ture of that Humiliation that the Scripture often &s;peaks

of, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation; but the&s;e Scrip|tures are &s;o expre&s;s, that it is needle&s;s to bring any fur|ther Arguments.</P>
<P>How far a wonderful and my&s;terious Agency of God's Spirit, may &s;o influence &s;ome Men's Hearts, that their Practice in this Regard may be contrary to their own Principles, &s;o that they &s;hall not tru&s;t in their own Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, tho' they profe&s;s that Men are ju&s;tified by their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s; or how far they may believe the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Men's own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s in <HI>general,</HI> and yet not believe it in a particular Application of it to them&s;elves; or how far that Error, which they may have been led into by Education, or cunning Sophi&s;try of others, may yet be indeed contrary to the prevailing Di&s;po&s;ition of their Hearts, and contrary to their Practice: Or how far &s;ome may <HI>&s;eem</HI> to maintain a Doctrine contrary to this Go&s;pel Doctrine of Ju&s;tification, that <HI>really</HI> do not, but only expre&s;s them&s;elves different|ly from others; or &s;eem to oppo&s;e it through their Mi&s;|under&s;tanding of our Expre&s;&s;ions, or we of theirs, when indeed our real Sentiments are the &s;ame in the Main; or may &s;eem to differ more than they do, by u&s;ing Terms that are without a preci&s;ely fix'd and deter|minate Meaning; or to be wide in their Sentiments from this Doctrine, for Want of a di&s;tinct Under|&s;tanding of it; who&s;e Hearts at the &s;ame Time intirely agree with it, and if once it was clearly explain'd to their Under&s;tandings, would immediately clo&s;e 'with it, and embrace it: How far the&s;e things may be I won't determine, but am fully per&s;waded that great Allowances are to be made, on the&s;e, and &s;uch like Accounts, in innumerable In&s;tances; tho' it is manife&s;t from what has been &s;aid, that the teaching &amp; propagating contrary Doctrines and Schemes is of a pernicious and fa|tal Tendency.</P>

are &s;aid to be <HI>until John;</HI> not that the Revelations given by them are out of U&s;e &s;ince that Time, but that the State of the Church founded and regulated, under God, by them, the Di&s;pen&s;ation of which they were the Mini&s;ters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and wherein the Church depended mainly on Light received from them, fully continued till <HI>John;</HI> who fir&s;t began to introduce the New Te&s;tament Di&s;|pen&s;ation, or Go&s;pel-State of the Church; which with its glorious &s;piritual and eternal Privileges and Ble&s;&s;ings, is often called the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> or <HI>Kingdom of God John the Bapti&s;t</HI> preached that the Kingdom of God was at Hand. That is the Account that we have of his Preaching, by the Evangeli&s;ts, <HI>Repent,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand: Since that Time,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>the Kingdom of God is preached. John the Bapti&s;t</HI> fir&s;t began to preach it; and then after him, Chri&s;t, and his Di&s;ciples, preached the &s;ame. Thus Chri&s;t preached, Matth. 4. 17. <HI>From that Time Je&s;us began to preach, and to &s;ay, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.</HI> So the Di&s;ciples were directed to preach, Matth. 10. 7. <HI>And as ye go preach, &s;aying, the Kingdom of Heaven is an Hand.</HI> It was not <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> but Chri&s;t that fully brought in, and actually e&s;tabli&s;hed this Kingdom of God; but he as Chri&s;t's Forerunner, to pre|pare his Way before him, did the fir&s;t Thing that was done towards introducing it. The old Di&s;pen&s;ation was aboli&s;hed, and the new brought in by Degrees; as the Night gradually cea&s;es, and gives Place to the increa&s;ing Day, which &s;ucceeds in it's Room: Fir&s;t the Day Star ri&s;es; next follows the Light of the Sun it &s;elf, but dim|ly reflected, in the dawning of the Day; but this Light increa&s;es, and &s;hines more and more, and the Stars that &s;erved for Light during the foregoing Night, gradually go out, and their Light cea&s;es, as being now needle&s;s, till at length the Sun ri&s;es, and enlightens the World by his own direct light, which increa&s;es as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e a&s;cends higher above the <HI>Horizon,</HI> till the Day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ar it &s;elf is gradually put out, and di&s;appears; agreeable to what <HI>John</HI> &s;ays of him&s;elf, John 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>He mu&s;t increa&s;e; but I mu&s;t decrea&s;e.

Harbinger of the Go&s;pel-Day; much as the Morning-Star is the Forerunner of the Sun. He had the mo&s;t honourable Office of any of the Prophets; when as the other Prophets foretold Chri&s;t to come, he revealed him as already come, &amp; had the Honour to be that Servant that &s;hould come immediately before him &amp; actually introduce him, &amp; even to be the In&s;trument concern'd in his &s;olemn In|auguration, as he was in Baptizing him. He was the great|e&s;t of the Prophets that came before Chri&s;t, as the Morning-Star is the brighte&s;t of all the Stars, <HI>Matth.</HI> 11. 11. He came to prepare Men's Hearts to receive that Kingdom of God, that Chri&s;t was about more fully to reveal and e|rect. Luke 1. 17. <HI>To make ready a People prepared for the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We may ob&s;erve wherein his Succe&s;s appear|ed, <HI>viz.</HI> in that &s;ince he began his Mini&s;try, <HI>every Man pre&s;&s;ed</HI> into that Kingdom of God that he preached. The Greatne&s;s of his Succe&s;s appeared in two Things;</P>
<P N="1">1. In the Generalne&s;s of it, with Regard to the Sub|ject, or the Per&s;ons in whom the Succe&s;s appeared; <HI>every Man:</HI> Here is a Term of Univer&s;ality; but 'tis not to be taken as univer&s;al with Regard to Individuals, but Kinds; as &s;uch univer&s;al Terms are often u&s;ed in Scrip|ture. When <HI>John</HI> preached there was an extraordinary pouring out of the Spirit of God, that attended his preaching; and an uncommon Awakening, and Con|cern for Salvation, appeared on the Minds of all &s;orts of Per&s;ons; and even in the mo&s;t unlikely Per&s;ons, and tho&s;e from whom &s;uch a Thing might lea&s;t be expected; as the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who were exceeding proud, and &s;elf|&s;ufficient, and conceited of their own Wi&s;dom and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and looked on them&s;elves fit to be Teachers of others, and u&s;ed to &s;corn to be taught; and the <HI>Sad|ducees,</HI> who were a kind of Infidels, that denied any Re|&s;urrection, Angel, or Spirit, or any future State: So that <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf &s;eems to be &s;urprized to &s;ee them come to him, under &s;uch Concern for their Salvation; as in Mat. 3. 7. <HI>But when he &s;aw many of the Phari&s;ees and Sad|ducees come to his Bapti&s;m, he &s;aid unto them, O Gene|ration of Vipers, Who hath warned you to flee from the

Wrath to come?</HI> And be&s;ides the&s;e, the <HI>Publicans</HI> who were &s;ome of the mo&s;t infamous &s;ort of Men, came to him, inquiring what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved. And the <HI>Soldiers,</HI> that were doubtle&s;s a very profane, loo&s;e, and profligate &s;ort of Per&s;ons; they made the &s;ame In|quiry Luke 3 12&punc; &amp; 14. <HI>Then came al&s;o Publicans to be bapti&s;ed, and &s;aid unto him, Ma&s;ter, What &s;hall we do? And the Soldiers likewi&s;e demanded of him, &s;aying, And what &s;hall we do?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. His Succe&s;s appear'd in the Manner in which his Hearers &s;ought the Kingdom of God, they <HI>pre&s;&s;ed into it:</HI> It is el&s;ewhere &s;et forth by their being <HI>violent</HI> for the Kingdom of Heaven, and <HI>taking it by Force.</HI> Matth. 11. 12 <HI>From the Days of</HI> John the Bapti&s;t <HI>until now, the Kingdom of Heaven &s;uffers Violence, and the Violent take it by Force.</HI></P>
<P>The DOCTRINE that I ob&s;erve from the Words is this.</P>
<P><HI>IT concerns every one that would obtain the Kingdom of God, to be pre&s;&s;ing into it.</HI></P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing on this Subject, I would</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Shew what is that Way of &s;eeking Salvation that &s;eems to be pointed forth, in the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>pre&s;&s;ing into the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Give the Rea&s;ons why it concerns every one that would <HI>obtain</HI> the Kingdom of God, to &s;eek it in this Way.</P>
<P>And <HI>then</HI> make Application.</P>
<P>I. I would &s;hew what Manner of &s;eeking Salvation &s;eems to be denoted by pre&s;&s;ing into the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Expre&s;&s;ion denotes <HI>Strength of De&s;ire.</HI> Men in general, that live under the Light of the Go&s;pel, and be not Athei&s;ts, do de&s;ire the Kingdom of God; that is, they de&s;ire to go to Heaven rather than to Hell; but mo&s;t of them are not much concerned about it; but on

the contrary live a &s;ecure and carele&s;s Life. And there are tho&s;e that are many Degrees above the&s;e, that are under &s;ome Degrees of the Awakenings of God's Spirit, that yet are not <HI>pre&s;&s;ing into the Kingdom of God.</HI> But they that may be &s;aid to be truly &s;o have <HI>&s;trong De&s;ires</HI> to get out of a natural Condition, and to get an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t: They have &s;uch a Conviction of the Mi&s;ery of their <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> State, and of the extreme Nece&s;&s;ity of ob|taining a <HI>better,</HI> that their Minds are as it were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>with,</HI> and wrapt up <HI>in</HI> Concern about it: To obtain Sal|vation is de&s;ired by them above all Things in the World: This Concern is &s;o great that it very much &s;huts out o|ther Concerns: They u&s;ed before to have the Stream of their De&s;ires after other Things, or it may be had their Concern divided between this and them; but when they come to an&s;wer the Expre&s;&s;ion in the Text, of <HI>pre&s;&s;ing into the Kingdom of God,</HI> this Concern prevails&punc; above all others; it lays other Things low, and does in a Man|ner engro&s;s the Care of the Mind.&mdash;This &s;eeking eternal Life &s;hould not only be <HI>one</HI> Concern that our Souls are taken up about, <HI>with other Things;</HI> but Salva|tion &s;hould be &s;ought as the <HI>one Thing</HI> needful, <HI>Luke</HI> 10. 42. And as the <HI>one Thing</HI> that is <HI>de&s;ired, P&s;alm</HI> 27.4.</P>
<P N="2">2 Pre&s;&s;ing into the Kingdom of Heaven denotes <HI>Ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and Firmne&s;s of Re&s;olution.</HI> There &s;hould be Strength of <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> accompanying Strength of <HI>De&s;ire,</HI> as it was in the P&s;almi&s;t in the Place ju&s;t now refer'd to; <HI>One Thing have I de&s;ired, and that will I &s;eek after.</HI> In order to a thorough Engagedne&s;s of the Mind in this Affair, both the&s;e mu&s;t meet together; be&s;ides De&s;ires after Salvation, there &s;hould be an earne&s;t Re&s;olution in Per&s;ons to pur&s;ue this Good as much as lies in their Power; to do all that in the U&s;e of their utmo&s;t Strength they are able to do, in an Attendance on every Duty, and re&s;i&s;ting and militating again&s;t all Manner of Sin, and to continue in &s;uch a Pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>There are two Things needful in a Per&s;on in order to the&s;e &s;trong Re&s;olutions in him: there mu&s;t be a Sen&s;e of the great Importance &amp; <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the Mercy &s;ought, and their mu&s;t al&s;o be a Sen&s;e of <HI>Opportunity</HI> to obtain

it, or the Encouragement there is to &s;eek it. The Strength of Re&s;olution depends on the Sen&s;e which God gives the Heart of the&s;e Things. Per&s;ons without &s;uch a Sen&s;e may &s;eem to them&s;elves to take up Re&s;olutions; they may as it were force a Promi&s;e to them&s;elves, and &s;ay with in them&s;elves, <HI>I will &s;eek as long as I live, I will not give out till I obtain,</HI> when they do but deceive them&s;elves, their Hearts are not in it; neither do they in|deed take up any &s;uch Re&s;olution as they &s;eem to them|&s;elves to do; 'tis the Re&s;olution of the Mouth more than of the Heart; their Hearts ben'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;trongly bent to fulfil what their Mouth &s;ays,.

Tho&s;e that are <HI>pre&s;&s;ing into the Kingdom of God</HI> have a Di&s;po&s;ition of Heart to do every Thing that is required, and that lies in their Power to do, and to continue in it: They have not only Earne&s;tne&s;s, but Steadine&s;s of Re&s;olution: They don't &s;eek with a wavering un&s;teady Heart, by Turns, or Fits, being off and on; but 'tis the con&s;tant Bent of the Soul, if po&s;&s;ible, to obtain the Kingdom of God.</P>

Many Per|&s;ons that &s;eem to be in great Di&s;tre&s;s about a future e|ternal State, get much into a Way of perplexing them|&s;elves with &s;uch Things as the&s;e.

<P>Hence we are not to judge of the Hopefulne&s;s of the Way that Per&s;ons are in, or of the Probability of their Suc|ce&s;s in &s;eeking Salvation, only by the Greatne&s;s of the Concern and Di&s;tre&s;s that they are in; for many Per&s;ons have needle&s;s Di&s;tre&s;&s;es that they had much better be without.

They therefore that are pre&s;&s;ing into the King|dom of God, go on with &s;uch Engagedne&s;s, that they break through the Difficulties that are in their Way: They are &s;o &s;et for Salvation that tho&s;e Things by which others are di&s;couraged, and &s;top'd, and turn'd back, don't &s;top <HI>them,</HI> but they pre&s;s through them. Per&s;ons ought to be &s;o re&s;olved for Heaven, that if by any Means they can u&s;e they <HI>can</HI> obtain, they <HI>will</HI> ob|tain. Whether tho&s;e <HI>Means</HI> be <HI>difficult</HI> or <HI>ea&s;y, cro&s;s</HI> or
<PB N="139" REF="004239_0146_10042CA21DD53118">
<HI>agreable,</HI> if they are requi&s;ite <HI>Means of Salvation,</HI> they &s;hould be complied with. When any Thing is pre&s;ent|ed to be done, the Que&s;tion &s;hould not be, Is it ea&s;y, or hard? Is it agreable to my carnal Inclinations or In|tere&s;t, or again&s;t them? But is it a required Means of my obtaining an Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and eternal Salvation? Thus the Apo&s;tle, Philip 3. 11. <HI>If by any Means I might obtain the Re&s;urrection of the Dead.</HI> He tells us there in the Context, what Difficulties he broke through, that <HI>he &s;uffered the Lo&s;s of all Things,</HI> and was willingly <HI>made conformable</HI> even to Chri&s;t's <HI>Death,</HI> tho' that was attended with &s;uch extreme Torment and Ig|nominy.</P>
<P>He that is pre&s;&s;ing into the Kingdom of God, com|monly finds many Things in the Way that are again&s;t the Grain; but he is not &s;top'd by the Cro&s;s that lies before him, but takes it up and carries it: If there be &s;omething that it is incumbent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him to do as he is one that &s;eeks Salvation, that is cro&s;s to his natural Temper, and is irk&s;ome to him on that Account, or &s;omething that he can't do without Suffering in his E&s;tate, or that he apprehends will look odd and &s;trange in the Eyes of others, and expo&s;e him to Ridicule and Reproach, or any Thing that will offend a Neighbour, and get his ill Will, or &s;omething that will be very cro&s;s to his own carnal Appetite, he'll pre&s;s through &s;uch Difficulties: Every Thing that is found to be a Weight that hinders him in running this Race, he ca&s;ts from him, though it be a Weight of Gold or Pearls; yea, if it be a Right Hand or Foot that offends him, he'll cut them off; and won't &s;tick at plucking out a Right Eye <HI>with his own Hands.</HI> The&s;e Things are in&s;uperable Dif|ficulties to tho&s;e that are not thoroughly engaged in &s;eeking their Salvation; they boggle exceedingly at them; they are &s;tumbling Blocks that they never get over. But it is not &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with him that pre&s;&s;es into the Kingdom of God: tho&s;e Things that, before he was thoroughly rou&s;ed from his Security, he u&s;ed to &s;tick at, and was wont to have long Parlyings and Di&s;putings with his own Con&s;cience about, and &s;et carnal Rea&s;on
<PB N="140" REF="004239_0147_10042CA798757D68">
to work to invent Arguments and Pleas to excu&s;e him|&s;elf from, he now &s;ticks at no longer; he has done with this endle&s;s Di&s;puting and Rea&s;oning, and pre&s;&s;es vio|lently through all Difficulties; let what will be in the Way, Heaven is what he mu&s;t, and will obtain, not <HI>if he can without Difficulty,</HI> but <HI>if it be po&s;&s;ible.</HI> He meets with Temptation; the Devil is often whi&s;pering him in his Ear, &s;etting Allurements before him, magnifying the Difficulties of the Work he is engaged in, telling him that they are in&s;uperable, and that he can never conquer them, and trying all Ways in the World to di&s;courage him; but &s;till he pre&s;&s;es forward: God has given and maintains &s;uch an earne&s;t Spirit for Heaven, that the Devil can't &s;top him in his Cour&s;e; he is not at Lei&s;ure to lend an Ear to what he has to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I come now,</P>
<P>II. To &s;hew <HI>way</HI> the Kingdom of Heaven &s;hould be &s;ought in this Manner.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be thus &s;ought</P>
<P N="1">1. On Account of the extreme <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> we are in of getting into the Kingdom of Heaven. We are in a <HI>Peri&s;hing Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of it: Without it we are utterly and eternally lo&s;t. Out of the Kingdom of God is no Safety; there is no other hiding Place; this is the only City of Refuge, in which we can be &s;ecure from the A|venger that pur&s;ues all the Ungodly. The Vengeance of God will pur&s;ue, overtake, and eternally de&s;troy, them that are not in this Kingdom. All that are with|out this Inclo&s;ure will be &s;wallowed up in an overflow|ing fiery Deluge of Wrath: They may &s;tand at the Door and knock, and cry Lord, Lord, open to us, in vain; they will be thru&s;t back; and God will have no Mercy on them; they &s;hall be eternally left of him; his fearful Vengeance will &s;eize them; the Devils will lay hold on them; and all Evil will come upon them; and there will be none to pity or help; their Ca&s;e will be utterly de&s;perate, and infinitely doleful: It will be a gone Ca&s;e with them; all Offers of Mercy, and Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of divine Goodne&s;s will be finally withdrawn,
<PB N="141" REF="004239_0148_10042CAD49D0C1A0">
and all Hope will be lo&s;t: God will have no Kind of Regard to their Well-Being; will take no Care of them to &s;ave them from any Enemy, or any Evil; but him&s;elf will be their dreadful Enemy, and will execute Wrath with Fury, and will take Vengeance in an inex|pre&s;&s;ibly dreadful Manner. Such as &s;hall be in this Ca&s;e will be lo&s;t and undone indeed! They will be funk down into Perdition, infinitely below all that we can think: For who knows the Power of God's Anger? And who knows the Mi&s;ery of that poor Worm, on whom that Anger is executed without Mercy?</P>
<P N="2">2. On Account of the <HI>Shortne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Uncertainty of the Opportunity</HI> for getting into this Kingdom. When a few Days are pa&s;t, all our Opportunity for it will be gone. Our Day is limited; God has &s;et our Bounds, and we know not where. While Per&s;ons are out of this Kingdom, they are in Danger every Hour of being over|taken with Wrath. We know not how &s;oon we &s;hall get pa&s;t that Line, beyond which there is no Work, Device, Knowlege, nor Wi&s;dom; and therefore we &s;hould do what we have to do with our Might. <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 9 10.</P>
<P N="3">3. On Account of the <HI>Difficulty</HI> of getting into the Kingdom of God. There are innumerable Difficulties in the Way; &s;uch as few conquer; mo&s;t of them that try have not Re&s;olution, Courage, Earne&s;tne&s;s, and Con|&s;tancy enough; but they fail, give out, and peri&s;h. The Difficulties are too many, and too great for them that don't violently pre&s;s forward, to grapple with; they never get along, but &s;tick by the Way, or are turn'd a|&s;ide, and turned back, and ruin'd. Matth. 7. 14. <HI>Strait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</HI> Luke 13. 24 <HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate; for many, I &s;ay unto you, will &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 The <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of obtaining. Tho' it be a Thing attended with &s;o much Difficulty, yet 'tis not a Thing impo&s;&s;ible. Acts 8 22. <HI>If perhaps the Thought of thine Heart may be forgiven thee.</HI> 2 Tim. 2. 25. <HI>If peradven|ture God will give them Repentance, to the acknowleging
<PB N="142" REF="004239_0149_10042CB54AF870F0">
of the Truth.</HI> However &s;inful a Per&s;on is, and whatever his Circum&s;tances are, there is notwith&s;tanding a Po&s;&s;i|bility of his Salvation; he him&s;elf is capable of it; and God is able to accompli&s;h it, and has Mercy &s;ufficient for it; and there is &s;ufficient Provi&s;ion made through Chri&s;t, that God may do it con&s;i&s;tent with the Honour of his Maje&s;ty, Ju&s;tice, and Truth: So that there is no Want either of Sufficiency in God, or Capacity in the Sinner, in order to this: The greate&s;t and vile&s;t, mo&s;t blind, dead, hard hearted Sinner living, is a Subject ca|pable of &s;aving Light and Grace. Seeing therefore there is &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity of obtaining the Kingdom of God, and &s;o &s;hort a Time, and &s;uch Difficulty, and yet &s;uch a Po&s;&s;ibility, it may well induce us to pre&s;s into it. <HI>Jonah</HI> 3. 8, 9.</P>
<P N="5">5. 'Tis meet that the Kingdom of Heaven &s;hould be thus &s;ought&punc; becau&s;e of the great <HI>Excellency</HI> of it. We are willing to &s;eek earthly Things, of trifling Value, with great Diligence, and through much Difficulty; it therefore certainly becomes us to &s;eek that with great Earne&s;tne&s;s. which is of infinitely greater Worth and Excellence: And how well may God expect and re|quire it of us, that we &s;hould &s;eek it in &s;uch a Manner, in order to our obtaining it!</P>
<P N="6">6 Such a Manner of &s;eeking is needful to <HI>prepare</HI> Per|&s;ons for the Kingdom of God. Such Earne&s;tne&s;s and Thoroughne&s;s of Endeavours, is the ordinary Means that God makes U&s;e of, to bring Per&s;ons to an Acquain|tance with them&s;elves, to a Sight of their own Hearts, to a Sen&s;e of their own Helple&s;ne&s;s, and to a De&s;pair in their own Strength and Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And &s;uch Engagedne&s;s and Con&s;tancy in &s;eeking the Kingdom of Heaven prepare the Soul to receive it the more joyful|ly and thankfully, and the more highly to prize and value it when obtained. So that 'tis in Mercy to us, as well as for the Glory of his own Name, that God has appointed &s;uch earne&s;t Seeking, to be the Way in which he will be&s;tow the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>The USE I would make of this Doctrine, is of <HI>Ex|hortation</HI> to all Chri&s;tle&s;s Per&s;ons to pre&s;s into the King|dom of God. Some of you are inquiring what you &s;hall do. You &s;eem to de&s;ire to know what is the Way wherein Salvation is to be &s;ought, and how you may be likely to obtain it: You have now heard the Way that the holy Word of God directs to.&mdash;Some are &s;eeking, but it can't be &s;aid of them that they are <HI>pre&s;|&s;ing</HI> into the Kingdom of Heaven. There are many that in Time pa&s;t have &s;ought Salvation, but not in this Man|ner, and &s;o they never obtain'd, but are now gone to Hell: Some of them &s;ought it Year after Year, but fail'd of it, and peri&s;hed at la&s;t: They were overtaken with divine Wrath, and are now &s;uffering the fearful Mi&s;ery of Damnation, and have no Re&s;t Day nor Night, hav|ing no more Opportunity to &s;eek, but mu&s;t &s;uffer and be mi&s;erable throughout the never ending Ages of Eter|nity. Be exhorted therefore not to &s;eek Salvation as they did, but let the Kingdom of Heaven &s;uffer Violence from you.</P>
<P>Here I would <HI>fir&s;t</HI> an&s;wer an <HI>Objection</HI> or two, and <HI>then</HI> proceed to give &s;ome <HI>Directions</HI> how to pre&s;s into the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Object. 1. <HI>Some may be ready to &s;ay, We can't do this of our &s;elves, that Strength of De&s;ire, and Firmne&s;s of Re|&s;olution, that have been &s;poken of, is out of our Reach: If I endeavour to re&s;olve and to &s;eek with Engagedne&s;s of Spirit, I find I fail: my Thoughts are pre&s;ently off from the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and I feel my &s;elf dull, and my Engagedne&s;s relax'd in Spite of all I can do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1 Tho' Earne&s;tne&s;s of Mind be not immediate|ly in your Power, yet the Con&s;ideration of what has been now &s;aid of the Need of it, may be a Means of &s;tirring you up to it. 'Tis true, Per&s;ons never will be thoroughly engaged in this Bu&s;ine&s;s unle&s;s it be by God's Influence; but God influences Per&s;ons by Means:
<PB N="144" REF="004239_0151_10042CC3CA613618">
Per&s;ons are not &s;tirr'd up to a thorough Earne&s;tnes;s without &s;ome Con&s;iderations that move them to it: And if Per&s;ons ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> but be made &s;en&s;ible of the Nece&s;&s;ity of Salvation, and al&s;o do duly con&s;ider the exceeding Dif|ficulty of it, and the Greatne&s;s of the Oppo&s;ition, and how &s;hort and uncertain the Time is, but yet are &s;en&s;ible that they have an Opportunity, and that there is a Po&s;|&s;ibility of their obtaining, they will need no more in order to their being thoroughly engaged&amp;re&s;olved in this Matter. If we &s;ee Per&s;ons &s;lack, and unre&s;olved, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;teady, it is becau&s;e they don't enough con&s;ider the&s;e Things.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though &s;trong De&s;ires and Re&s;olutions of Mind be not in your Power, yet Painfulne&s;s of Endeavours is in your Power. 'Tis in your Power to take Pains in the U&s;e of Means, yea very great Pains. You can be very painful and diligent in watching your own Heart, and &s;triving again&s;t Sin; though there is all Manner of Corruption in the Heart, that is continually ready to work, yet you can very laboriou&s;ly watch and &s;trive a|gain&s;t the&s;e Corruptions; and 'tis in your Power, with great Diligence to attend the Matter of your Duty to|wards God, and towards your Neighbour 'Tis in your Power to attend all Ordinances, and all publick and private Duties of Religion, and to do it with your Might. It would be a Contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e that a Man can't do the&s;e Things with <HI>all the Might</HI> he has, tho' he can't do them with <HI>more might</HI> than he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. The Dul|ne&s;s and Deadne&s;s of the Heart, and Slothfulne&s;s of Di&s;po&s;ition, don't hinder Men's being <HI>able</HI> to take Pains; tho' it hinders their being willing: That is one Thing wherein your Laboriou&s;ne&s;s may appear, even &s;triving again&s;t your own Dulne&s;s. That Men have a dead and &s;luggi&s;h Heart, don't argue that they be not able to take Pains; it is &s;o far from that, that it gives Occa&s;ion for Pains: It is one of the Difficulties in the Way of Duty, that Per&s;ons have to &s;trive with, and that gives Occa&s;ion for Struggling and Labour. If there were no Difficulties attended &s;eeking Salvation there would be no Occa&s;ion for Striving; a Man would have
<PB N="145" REF="004239_0152_10042CCFEA003668">
nothing to &s;trive about. There is indeed a great Deal of Difficulty attending all Duties required of tho&s;e that would obtain Heaven. 'Tis an exceeding difficult Thing for them to keep their Thoughts; 'tis a difficult Thing &s;eriou&s;ly, or to any good Purpo&s;e, to con&s;ider of Matters of the greate&s;t Importance; 'tis a difficult Thing to hear, or read, or pray attentively: But it don't argue that a Man can't &s;trive in the&s;e Things becau&s;e they are difficult; nay, he could not &s;trive in them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f there were not Difficulty in them: For what is there excepting Difficulties that any can have to &s;trive or &s;truggle with, in any Affair or Bu&s;ine&s;s?&mdash;Earne&s;tne&s;s of Mind, and Diligence of Endeavour, tend to promote each other. He that has an Heart earne&s;tly <HI>engaged,</HI> will <HI>take Pains;</HI> and he that is diligent and <HI>painful</HI> in all Duty, probably won't be <HI>&s;o</HI> long, before he finds the <HI>Sen&s;iblene&s;s</HI> of his Heart, and <HI>Earne&s;tne&s;s</HI> of his Spirit greatly increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Object. 2. <HI>Some may object that if they are earne&s;t, and take a great Deal of Pains, they &s;hall be in Danger of tru&s;ting to what they do; they are afraid of doing their Duty for Fear of making a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;</HI> There is ordinarily no Kind of Seekers that tru&s;t &s;o much to what they do, as &s;lack and dull Seek|ers. Though all that are &s;eeking Salvation, that have never been the Subjects of a thorough Humiliation, do tru&s;t in their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s; yet &s;ome do it much more fully than others. Some tho' they tru&s;t in their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet be not quiet in it. And tho&s;e that are mo&s;t di&s;turbed <HI>in</HI> their Self-Confidence, and are therefore in the likelie&s;t Way to be wholly brought off from it, are not tho&s;e that go on in a remi&s;s Way of Seeking, but tho&s;e that are mo&s;t earne&s;t and thoroughly engaged; partly becau&s;e in &s;uch a Way Con&s;cience i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> kept more &s;en&s;ible. A more awaken'd Con&s;cience won't re&s;t &s;o quietly in moral and religious Duties, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> one that is le&s;s awaken'd. A dull Seeker's Con&s;cience will be in a great Mea&s;ure &s;atisfied and quieted with his own Works and Performances; but one that is thoroughly awaken'd can't be &s;till'd or pacified with &s;uch Things as
<PB N="146" REF="004239_0153_10042CD4C3687F60">
the&s;e. And, <HI>partly,</HI> becau&s;e in this Way Per&s;ons gain much more Knowlege of them&s;elves, and Acquaintance with their own Hearts, than in a negligent &s;lighty Way of Seeking; for they have a great Deal <HI>more Experience</HI> of them&s;elves. 'Tis Experience <HI>of our &s;elves,</HI> and finding what we are, that God commonly makes U&s;e of as the Means of bringing us off from all Dependence <HI>on our &s;elves:</HI> But Men never get Acquaintance with them|&s;elves &s;o fa&s;t, as in the mo&s;t earne&s;t Way of Seeking. They that are in this Way, have more to engage them to think of their Sins, and &s;trictly to ob&s;erve them&s;elves, and have much more to do with their own Hearts than others. Such an one has much more Experience of his own <HI>Weakne&s;s,</HI> than another that don't put forth, and try his <HI>Strength;</HI> and will therefore &s;ooner &s;ee him&s;elf dead in Sin: Such an one, though he hath a Di&s;po&s;ition continually to be flying to his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet finds Re&s;t <HI>in nothing;</HI> he wanders about from one Thing to another, &s;eeking &s;omething to ea&s;e his di&s;quieted Con&s;cience; he is driven from one Refuge to another, goes from Mountain to Hill, &s;eeking Re&s;t and finding none; and therefore will the &s;ooner prove that there is no Re&s;t to be found, nor Tru&s;t to be put, in any Crea|ture Confidence what&s;oever.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore quite a wrong Notion that &s;ome enter|tain, that the more they do, the more they &s;hall depend on it: Whereas the Rever&s;e is true; the more they <HI>do,</HI> or the more thorough they are in <HI>&s;eeking,</HI> the le&s;s will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they be likely to re&s;t <HI>in their Doings,</HI> and the &s;ooner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they &s;ee the Vanity of <HI>all that they do.</HI> So that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will exceedingly mi&s;s it, if ever they neglect to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> any Duty either to God or Man, whether it be any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Religion, Ju&s;tice, or Charity, under a Notion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its expo&s;ing them to tru&s;t in their own Righteou&s;|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ns.

Slackne&s;s in Religion, and their Tru&s;t in their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, do &s;trengthen and e&s;tabli&s;h one another.

And on the other Hand, their Negligence tends &s;o to benumb them, and keep them in &s;uch Ignorance of them&s;elves, that the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Refuges are &s;tupidly re&s;ted in as &s;uffici|ent.

<P>I would now proceed to give &s;ome <HI>Directions</HI> how you &s;hould pre&s;s into the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be directed as it were to &s;acrifice every Thing to your Souls eternal Intere&s;t. Let &s;eeking this be &s;o much your Bent, and what you are &s;o re&s;olved in, that you will make every Thing give Place to it.

Whatever it be that you u&s;ed to look upon as a Convenience, or Comfort, or Ea&s;e, or Thing de&s;ireable on any Account, if it &s;tands in the Way of this great Concern, let it be di&s;mi&s;s'd without He&s;itati|on; and if it be of that Nature that it is like always to be an Hindrance, then wholly have done with it, and never entertain any Expectation from it more. If in Time pa&s;t, you have, for the &s;ake of worldly Gain, in|volved your &s;elf in more Care and Bu&s;ine&s;s than you find to be con&s;i&s;tent with your being &s;o thorough in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion as you ought to be, then get into &s;ome other Way, tho' you &s;uffer in your worldly Intere&s;t by it.

If the Fle&s;h mu&s;t be cro&s;s'd, then cro&s;s it, &s;pare it not, crucify it, and don't be afraid of being too cruel to it.

Let Salvation be the one Thing with you. This is what is certainly required of you: and this is what many &s;tick at; this giving up other Things for Salvation, is a &s;tumbling Block that few get over. While others pre&s;s'd into the Kingdom of God, at the preaching of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> there was <HI>Herod,</HI> one of his Hearers, that was pretty much &s;tirr'd up by his Preaching; it is &s;aid, <HI>he heard him, and ob&s;erved him, and did many Things;</HI> but when he came to tell him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> part with his beloved <HI>Herodias,</HI> here he &s;tuck; this he never would yield to, <HI>Mark</HI> 7. 18, 19, 20.

It may be if Chri&s;t had directed him only to give away a con&s;iderable <HI>Part</HI> of his E&s;tate, he would have done it; yea, perhaps, if he had bid him part with <HI>half</HI> of it, he would have complied with it; but when he directed him to throw up <HI>all,</HI> he could not grapple with &s;uch a Propo&s;al. Herein the Straitne&s;s of the Gate very much con&s;i&s;ts, and 'tis on this Account that &s;o many &s;eek to enter in, and are not able. There are many that have a great Mind to have Salvation, and &s;pend great Part of their Time in wi&s;hing that they had it, but they will not comply with the nece&s;&s;ary Means of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be directed to forget the Things that are behind; that is, not to keep thinking and making much of what you have done, but let your Mind be wholly intent on what you have to do. In &s;ome Sen&s;e you ought to look back; you &s;hould look back on your Sins. Jer. 2. 23. <HI>See thy Way in the Valley, know what thou ha&s;t done.</HI> You &s;hould look back on the Wretchedne&s;s of your re|ligious Performances, and con&s;ider how you have fallen &s;hort in them, and how exceedingly polluted all your Duties have been, and how ju&s;tly God might reject and loath them, and you for them: But you ought not to &s;pend your Time in looking back, as many Per&s;ons do, thinking how much they have done for their Salva|tion, what great Pains they have taken and how that they have done what they can, and don't &s;ee how they can do more, how long a Time they have been &s;eeking, and how much more they have done than others, and even than &s;uch and &s;uch who have obtained Mercy; and &s;o think with them&s;elves how hardly God deals with them, that he don't extend Mercy to them&punc; but turns a deaf Ear to their Cries; and hence di&s;courage them&s;elves, and complain of God. Don't thus &s;pend your Time in looking on what is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> forward, and con&s;ider what is before you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> is that you <HI>can do,</HI> and what 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that you <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hould do,</HI> and what God calls you &s;till <HI>to do,</HI> in order to your own Salvation. The Apo&s;tle in the third Chapter to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> tells us what Things he did while a <HI>Jew,</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="004239_0157_10042CEF5D56A690">
how much he had to boa&s;t of, if any could have any Thing of their own to boa&s;t of; but he tells us that he forgot tho&s;e Things, and all others that were behind, and reached forth towards the Things that were before, pre&s;&s;ing forwards, towards the Mark, for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="3">3. Labour to get your Heart thoroughly di&s;po&s;ed to go on and hold out to the End. Many that &s;eem to be earne&s;t have not a Heart thus di&s;po&s;ed. 'Tis a com|mon Thing for Per&s;ons to appear greatly affected for a little while; but all is &s;oon pa&s;t away, and there is no more to be &s;een of it. Labour therefore to obtain a thorough Willingne&s;s, and Preparation of Spirit, to con|tinue Seeking, in the U&s;e of your utmo&s;t Endeavours, without Limitation; and don't think your whole Life too long. And in order to this be advi&s;ed to two Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Remember that if ever God be&s;tows Mercy upon you, he will u&s;e his &s;overeign Plea&s;ure about the Time when. He will be&s;tow it on &s;ome in a little Time, and on others not till they have &s;ought it long. If other Per&s;ons are &s;oon enlighten'd and comforted, while you remain long in Darkne&s;s, there is no other Way but for you to wait. God <HI>will</HI> act arbitrarily in this Matter, and you can't help it. You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> e'en be content to wait, in a Way of laborious and earne&s;t Striving, till his Time comes. If you refu&s;e, you will but undo your &s;elf; and when you &s;hall hereafter find your &s;elf undone, and &s;ee that your Ca&s;e is pa&s;t Remedy, how will you con|demn your &s;elf for foregoing a great Probability of Sal|vation, only becau&s;e you had not Patience to hold out, and was not willing to be at the Trouble of a per&s;e|vering Labour? And what will it avail before God, or your own Con&s;cience, to &s;ay that you could not bear to be obliged to &s;eek Salvation &s;o long, when God be|&s;towed it on others that &s;ought it but for a very &s;hort Time? Though God may have be&s;towed the Te&s;timo|nies of his Favour on others in a few Days, or Hours after they have begun earne&s;tly to &s;eek it, how does that alter the Ca&s;e as to you, if there proves to be a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="151" REF="004239_0158_100404A978F94808">
of your laboriou&s;ly &s;eeking many Years before you obtain them? Is Salvation the le&s;s Worth the ta|king a <HI>great Deal</HI> of Pains for, becau&s;e, through the &s;overeign Plea&s;ure of God, others have obtained with comparatively but <HI>little</HI> Pains? If there are two Per&s;ons, the one of which has obtain'd converting Grace with comparative Ea&s;e, and another that has obtained it after continuing for many Years in the greate&s;t and mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t Labours after it, how little Difference does it make at la&s;t, when once Salvation is obtain'd! Put all the Labour, and Pains, and long continued Difficulties and Strugglings of the one, in the Scale <HI>again&s;t</HI> Salva|tion, and how little does it &s;ub&s;tract; and put the Ea&s;e with which the other has obtain'd, in the Scale <HI>with</HI> Salvation, and how little does it add? What is either added or &s;ub&s;tracted, is lighter than Vanity, and a Thing worthy of no Con&s;ideration, when compar'd with that <HI>infinite</HI> Benefit that is obtain'd. Indeed if you were to live ten thou&s;and Years, and all that Time &s;hould &s;trive and pre&s;s forward with as great Earne&s;tne&s;s as ever a Per&s;on did for one Day, all this would bear no Propor|tion to the Importance of the Benefit, and would doubt|le&s;s appear little to you, when once you come to be in actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eternal Glory, and to &s;ee what that eternal Mi&s;ery is that you have e&s;caped.&mdash;You mu&s;t not think much of your Pains, and of the length of Time; you mu&s;t pre&s;s towards the Kingdom of God, and do your utmo&s;t, and hold out to the End, and learn to make no Account of it when you have done. You mu&s;t undertake the Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;eeking Salvation upon the&s;e Terms, and with no other Expectation than this, that if ever God be&s;tows Mercy it <HI>will be</HI> in his own Time, and not only &s;o, but al&s;o that when you have done all, God will not hold him&s;elf obliged to &s;how you Mercy at la&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Endeavour now thoroughly to weigh in your Mind the <HI>Difficulty,</HI> and to count the <HI>Co&s;t</HI> of Per&s;eve|rance in &s;eeking Salvation. You that are now &s;etting out in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, (as there are many here that have very lately &s;et about it;&mdash;Prai&s;ed be the Name of
<PB N="152" REF="004239_0159_10042CFB5F458610">
God that he has &s;tirr'd you up to it!) be exhorted to attend this Direction. Don't undertake in this Affair, with any other Thought, but of giving your &s;elf wholly to it for the remaining Part of your Life, and going through many and great Difficulties in it. Take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eed that you don't engage &s;ecretly upon this Condition, that you &s;hall obtain in a little Time, promi&s;ing your &s;elf that it &s;hall be within this pre&s;ent Sea&s;on of the pour|ing out of God's Spirit, or with any other Limitation of Time what&s;oever. Many when they begin, &s;eem|ing to &s;et out very earne&s;tly, don't expect that they &s;hall need to &s;eek very long; and &s;o don't prepare them&s;elves for it: And therefore when they come to find it otherwi&s;e, and meet with unexpected Difficul|ty, they are found unguarded, and ea&s;ily overthrown. But let me advi&s;e all that are now &s;eeking their Sal|vation, not to entertain any &s;elf flattering Thoughts; but weigh the utmo&s;t Difficulties of Per&s;everance, and be provided for them, having your Mind fix'd in it to go through them, let them be what they will. Con&s;ider now beforehand, how tedious it would be, with utmo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s and Labour, to &s;trive after Salvation, for many Years, in the mean time receiving no joyful o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> comfortable Evidence of your having obtain'd. Con&s;i|der what a great Temptation to Di&s;couragement there probably would be in it; how apt you would be to yield the Ca&s;e; how ready to think that 'tis in vain for you to &s;eek any longer, and that God never intends to &s;hew you Mercy, in that he has not yet done it; how apt you would be to think with your &s;elf, <Q>What an un|comfortable Life do I live! how much more unplea|&s;antly do I &s;pend my Time than others, that don't perplex their Minds about the Things of another World, but are at Ea&s;e, and take the Comfort of their worldly Enjoyments!</Q> Con&s;ider what a Temptation there would probably be in it, if you &s;aw others brought in, that began to &s;eek the Kingdom of Heaven long af|ter you, rejoycing in a Hope and Sen&s;e of God's Favour after but little Pains, and a &s;hort Time of Awakening; while you from Day to Day, and from Year to Year,

<P>I hope that tho&s;e that have given Attention to what has been &s;aid, have by this Time conceived in &s;ome Mea&s;ure what is &s;ignified by the Expre&s;&s;ion in the Text&punc; and after what Manner they ought to <HI>pre&s;s into the King|dom of God.</HI> Here is this to induce you to a Compliance with what you have been directed to; if you &s;it &s;till you die, if you go backward behold you &s;hall &s;urely die, if you go forward you may live. And though God has not bound him&s;elf to any Thing that a Per&s;on does, while de&s;titute of Faith, &amp; out of Chri&s;t, yet there is great Probabi|lity, that in a Way of hearkening to this Coun&s;el you <HI>will live,</HI> &amp; that by pre&s;&s;ing onward, &amp; per&s;evering, you will at la&s;t as it were by Violence take the Kingdom of Hea|ven.

<P>God is plea&s;ed at this Time, in a very remarkable Manner, to be pouring out his Spirit among&s;t us; (Glo|ry be to his Name therefor!) You that have a Mind to obtain converting Grace, and to go to Heaven when you die, now is your Sea&s;on! <HI>Now,</HI> if you have any Sort of Prudence for your own Salvation, and have not a Mind to go to Hell, improve this Time!

You that in Time pa&s;t have been called upon, and have turn'd a deaf Ear to God's Voice, and long &s;tood out and re&s;i&s;ted his Commands and Coun&s;els, hear God's Voice to Day, while it is called to Day! Don't harden your Hearts at &s;uch a Day as this is! Now you have a &s;pecial and remarkable price put into your Hands to get Wi&s;dom, if you have but a Heart to improve it.</P>
<P>God hath his certain Days, or appointed Sea&s;ons of the Exerci&s;e both of Mercy and Judgment. There are &s;ome Sea&s;ons that are remarkable Times of Wrath, that are laid out by God for that Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz</HI> for his aw|ful Vi&s;itation, and the Executions of his Anger; which Times are called Days of Vengeance, <HI>Prov</HI> 6. 34 And Days wherein God will vi&s;it for Sin, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32. 34 And &s;o on the contrary, there are &s;ome other Times, that God has laid out in his &s;overeign Coun&s;els, for Sea&s;ons of remarkable Mercy, wherein he will appear, and ma|nife&s;t him&s;elf, in the Exerci&s;es of his Grace and Loving|kindne&s;s, more than at other Times: Such Times, in Scripture are called by Way of Eminency, accept|ed Times, and Days of Salvation, and al&s;o Days of God's Vi&s;itation; becau&s;e they are Days wherein God will vi&s;it in a Way of Mercy; as Luke 19 44. <HI>And

There is a Door of Mercy always &s;tanding open for Sinners; but at &s;uch a Day as this God opens an extraordinary Door.</P>
<P>We are directed to &s;eek the Lord while he may be found, and to call upon him while he is near, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 55 6. If you that are hitherto Chri&s;tle&s;s, be not &s;trangely be|&s;otted and infatuated, you will by all Means improve &s;uch an Opportunity as this to get Heaven, when Hea|ven is brought &s;o near, when the Fountain is open'd in the mid&s;t of us in &s;o extraordinary a Manner. Now is the Time to obtain a Supply of the Nece&s;&s;ities of your poor peri&s;hing Souls! This is the Day for Sinners that have a Mind to be converted before they die, when God is dealing forth &s;o liberally and bountifully among&s;t us, when <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Salvation</HI> Work is going on a|mong&s;t us from Sabbath to Sabbath, and many are pre&s;|&s;ing into the Kingdom of God! Now don't &s;tay behind, but pre&s;s in among the Re&s;t! Others have been &s;tirred up to be in good Earne&s;t, and have taken Heaven by Violence; be intreated to follow their Example, if you would have a Part of the Inheritance with them, and would not be <HI>le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> at the great Day, when they are taken!</P>
<P>How &s;hould it move you to con&s;ider, that you have this Opportunity <HI>now in your Hands!</HI> You are in the actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it! If it were pa&s;t, it would not be in your Power to recover it, or in the Power of any Creature to bring it back for you; but 'tis not pa&s;t; 'tis NOW, at this Day; NOW is the accepted Time, even while it is called to Day! Will you &s;it &s;till at &s;uch a Time? Will you &s;leep in &s;uch a Harve&s;t? Will you deal with a &s;lack Hand, and &s;tay behind out of

You are behind &s;till! and &s;o you will be in Danger of being left behind, when the whole Number is compleated that are to enter in, if you don't earne&s;tly be &s;tir your &s;elf! To be left behind, at the clo&s;e of &s;uch a Sea&s;on as this, will be awful, next to the being left behind on that Day when God's Saints &s;hall mount up as with Wings to meet the Lord in the Air, and will be what will appear very threatning of it.</P>
<P>God is now calling you in an extraordinary Manner, and 'tis agreable to the Will and Word of Chri&s;t that I &s;hould now, in his Name call you&punc; as one &s;et over you, and &s;ent to you to that End; &s;o 'tis his Will that you &s;hould hearken to what I &s;ay, as his Voice: I therefore be&s;eech you in Chri&s;t's Stead now to pre&s;s into the Kingdom of God! Whoever you are, whether young or old, &s;mall or great; whatever you be; if you are a great Sinner, if you have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n a Back&s;lider, if you have quenched the Spirit, let you be who you will, and what|ever you have done, don't &s;tand making Objections, but ari&s;e, apply your &s;elf to your Work! Do, what you have to do, with your Might. Chri&s;t is calling you <HI>be|fore,</HI> and holding forth his Grace and everla&s;ting Bene|fits, and Wrath is pur&s;uing you <HI>behind;</HI> wherefore fly for your Life, and look not behind you!</P>
<P>But here I would particularly direct my &s;elf to &s;eve|ral Sorts of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I. To tho&s;e Sinners that are in a Mea&s;ure awaken'd, and are concern'd for their Salvation. You have Rea&s;on to be glad that you have &s;uch an Opportunity, and to prize it above Gold. To induce you to prize and improve it, con&s;ider &s;everal Things.</P>

<P N="3">3. How much more ea&s;ily converting Grace is obtain|ed at &s;uch a Time, than at other Times.

It is, as I &s;aid before, a Day of God's gracious Vi&s;itation, a Day that he has as it were &s;et apart for the more liberally and bountifully di&s;pen&s;|ing his Grace; a Day wherein God's Hand is opened wide: Experience &s;hews it.

In&s;tances as that of the Jayler abounded then, in Fulfil|ment of that Prophecy, I&s;ai. 66 7, 8. <HI>Before &s;he travail|ed &s;he brought forth; before her Pain came &s;he was deli|vered of a Man child. Who hath heard &s;uch a Thing? Who hath &s;een &s;uch Things? For as &s;oon as</HI> Zion <HI>travailed, &s;he brought forth her Children.</HI> So it is in &s;ome Degree, whenever there is an extraordinary pouring out of the Spirit of God; more or le&s;s &s;o, in Proportion to the Greatne&s;s of that Effu&s;ion. There is &s;eldom &s;uch quick Work made of it at other Times: Per&s;ons are not &s;o &s;oon delivered from their various Temptations, and In|tanglements; but are much longer wandring in a Wil|derne&s;s, and groping in Darkne&s;s, And yet,</P>
<P N="4">4. There are probably &s;ome here pre&s;ent, that are now concerned about their Salvation, that never will obtain. 'Tis not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that all that are now <HI>moved</HI> and <HI>awaken'd,</HI> will ever be &s;avingly <HI>converted:</HI> Doubtle&s;s there are many now &s;eeking that will not be able to enter. When has it been &s;o in Times pa&s;t, when there have been Times of great Out pourings of God's Spirit, but that many that for a while, have inquired with others, what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved, have fail|ed, and afterwards grown hard and &s;ecure? All of you that are now awaken'd, have a Mind to obtain Salvati|on, and probably hope to get a Title to Heaven, in the Time of this pre&s;ent moving of God's Spirit: But yet, (though it be awful to be &s;poken, and awful to be thought) we have no Rea&s;on to think any other, than than &s;ome of you will burn in Hell to all Eternity. You all are afraid of Hell, and &s;eem at pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ed to take Pains to be delivered from it; and yet it would be unrea&s;onable to think any other, than that &s;ome of you will have your Portion in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brim&s;tone. Tho' there are &s;o many that &s;eem to obtain <HI>&s;o ea&s;ily,</HI> having been but a little while under Convictions, yet, for all that, &s;ome <HI>never</HI> will obtain. Some will &s;oon loo&s;e the Sen&s;e of Things they now have; tho' their Awakenings &s;eem to be very con&s;ide|rable for the pre&s;ent, they wont hold; they have not Hearts di&s;po&s;ed to hold on through very many Difficul|ties.
<PB N="159" REF="004239_0166_10042D23CF233E80">
Some that have &s;et out for Heaven, and hope as much as others to obtain, are indeed but &s;lighty and &s;lack, even <HI>now,</HI> in the mid&s;t of &s;uch a Time as this: And others, that for the pre&s;ent &s;eem to be more in Earne&s;t, will probably before long decline, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail, and gradually return to be as they were before. The Convictions of &s;ome &s;eem to be great, while that which is the Occa&s;ion of their Convictions is new&punc; which when that begins to grow old, will gradually decay, and wear off. Thus, it may be, the Occa&s;ion of your Awaken|ing has been the Hearing of the Conver&s;ion of &s;ome Per&s;on, or your &s;eeing &s;o extraordinary a Di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence as this is, in which God now appears a|mong&s;t us; but by and by the Newne&s;s and Fre&s;hne&s;s of the&s;e Things <HI>will be gone,</HI> and &s;o won't affect your Mind as now they do; and it may be your Convictions will go away with it.</P>
<P>Tho' &s;uch a Time as this, be a Time wherein God doth more liberally be&s;tow his Grace than at other Times, and &s;o a Time of greater Advantage for obtain|ing it, yet there &s;eems to be, upon &s;ome Accounts, greater Danger of Back&s;liding, than when Per&s;ons are awaken'd at other Times. For commonly &s;uch extraor|dinary Times don't la&s;t long; and then when they cea&s;e there are Multitudes that loo&s;e their Convictions as it were together: As the Spirit of God departs, awa|kenings ea&s;e off from the Minds of Per&s;ons all over a Town.</P>
<P>We &s;peak of it as an happy Thing, that God is plea&s;|ed to be cau&s;ing of it to be &s;uch a Time among&s;t us; and &s;o it is indeed: but there are &s;ome that it will be no Benefit to; it will but be an Occa&s;ion of their great|er Mi&s;ery; they will wi&s;h they had never &s;een this Time; it will be more tolerable for tho&s;e that never &s;aw it, or any Thing like it, in the Day of Judgment than for them. 'Tis an awful Con&s;ideration, that there are probably tho&s;e here, that the great Judge will here|after call to a &s;trict Account about this very Thing, why they no better improved this Opportunity, when he did <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;et open the Fountain of his Grace, and did &s;o loudly
<PB N="160" REF="004239_0167_10042D2555573608">
call upon them, and came and &s;trove <HI>with them in par|ticular,</HI> by the Awakening Influences of his Spirit; and they will have no good Account to give to the Judge, but their Mouths will be &s;top'd, and they will &s;tand Speechle&s;s before him.</P>
<P>You had need therefore to be earne&s;t, and very tho|rough and re&s;olved in this Affair, that you may not be one of tho&s;e that &s;hall thus fail, that you may &s;o fight, as not uncertainly, and &s;o run, as that you may win the Prize.</P>
<P N="5">5. Con&s;ider what &s;ad Circum&s;tances Times of extra|ordinary Effu&s;ion of God's Spirit commonly leave Per|&s;ons in, when they leave them unconverted. They find them in a <HI>doleful</HI> Condition, becau&s;e in a <HI>natural</HI> Condi|tion, but commonly leave them in a much <HI>more doleful</HI> Condition. They are left dreadfully harden'd, and with a great Increa&s;e of Guilt, and their Souls under a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;trong Dominion and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Satan. And frequent|ly, Sea&s;ons of extraordinary Advantage for Salvation, when they pa&s;s over Per&s;ons, and they don't improve them, nor receive any Good in them, &s;eal their Damna|tion. As &s;uch Sea&s;ons leave them, God for ever leaves them, and gives them up to judicial Hardne&s;s. Luke 19. 41, 42. <HI>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, &s;aying&punc; If thou had&s;t known, even thou, the Things which belong to thy Peace!&mdash;But now they are hid from thine Eyes.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Con&s;ider, that 'tis very uncertain whether you will ever &s;ee &s;uch another Time as this is. If there &s;hould be &s;uch another Time, 'tis very uncertain whether you will live to <HI>&s;ee</HI> it. Many that are now concerned for their Salvation among&s;t us, will probably be in their Graves, and it may be in Hell before that Time; and if you &s;hould mi&s;s this Opportunity, it may be &s;o with you. And what Good will that do you, to have the Spirit of God poured out upon Earth, in the Place where you once lived, while you are tormented in Hell? What will it avail you, that others are crying, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> while you are &s;hut up for ever in the bottomle&s;s Pit, and are wailing and gna&s;hing your Teeth in everla&s;ting Burnings?</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="004239_0168_10042D26DD017DC8">
Wherefore improve this Opportunity, while God is pour|ing out his Spirit on Earth, &amp; you are on Earth, &amp; while you dwell in that Place where the Spirit of God is thus poured out, &amp; you your &s;elf have the awakening Influences of it, that you may never wail and gna&s;h your Teeth in Hell, but may &s;ing in Heaven for ever, with others that are redeemed from among&s;t <HI>Men,</HI> and redeemed among&s;t <HI>us.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. If you &s;hould &s;ee another &s;uch Time, it will be un|der far greater Di&s;advantages than you now &s;ee this Time. You will probably then be much older, and will have more harden'd your Heart; and &s;o will be under le&s;s Probability of receiving Good. Some Per&s;ons are &s;o harden'd in Sin, and &s;o left of God, that they can live through &s;uch a Time as this, and not be much awaken'd or affected by it; they can &s;tand their Ground, and be but Little moved. And &s;o may it be with you, by another &s;uch Time, if there &s;hould be another among&s;t us, and you &s;hould live to &s;ee it. The Ca&s;e in all Pro|hability will be greatly altered with you by that Time. If you &s;hould continue Chri&s;tle&s;s and Gracele&s;s till then, you will be much further from the Kingdom of God, and much deeper involved in Snares and Mi&s;ery; and the Devil will probably have a va&s;tly greater Ad|vantage again&s;t you, to tempt and confound you.</P>
<P N="8">8. We don't know but that God is now gathering in his Elect, before &s;ome great and &s;ore Judgment. It has been God's Manner before he ca&s;ts off a vi&s;ible Peo|ple, or brings &s;ome great and de&s;troying Judgments up|on them, fir&s;t to gather in his Elect, that <HI>they</HI> may be &s;ecure. So it was before the ca&s;ting off of the <HI>Jews</HI> from being God's People: There was fir&s;t a very remar|kable pouring out of the Spirit, and gathering in of the Elect, by the Preaching of the Apo&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts, as we read in the beginning of the <HI>Acts:</HI> But after this Harve&s;t, and it's Gleanings were over, <HI>the Re&s;t were blinded,</HI> and harden'd; the Go&s;pel had little Succe&s;s a|mong&s;t them, and the Nation was given up, and ca&s;t off from being God's People, and their City and Land was de&s;troyed by the <HI>Romans&punc;</HI> in a terrible Manner; and
<PB N="162" REF="004239_0169_10042D2F113EF290">
they have been ca&s;t off by God now for a great many Ages, and &s;till remain a harden'd and rejected People. So we read in the beginning of the 7th Chapter of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> that God, when about to bring de&s;troying Judgments on the Earth, fir&s;t &s;ealed his Servants in the Forehead: He &s;et his Seal upon the Hearts of the Elect, gave them the &s;aving Influences and Indwelling of his Spirit, by which they were <HI>&s;ealed to the Day of Redemption.</HI> Rev. 7. 1, 2, 3. <HI>And after the&s;e Things, I &s;aw four Angels, &s;tanding on the four Corners of the Earth, holding the four Winds of the Earth, that the Wind &s;hould not blow on the Earth, nor on the Sea, nor on any Tree. And I &s;aw another Angel a&s;cending from the Ea&s;t, having the Seal of the living God: And he cried with a loud Voice, to the four Angels, to whom it was given to hurt the Earth, and the Sea, &s;aying, Hurt not the Earth, neither the Sea, nor the Trees, till we have &s;ealed the Servants of our God in their Foreheads.</HI></P>
<P>And we don't know but that this may be the Ca&s;e now, that God is about, in a great Mea&s;ure, to for&s;ake this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and, and give up this People, and to bring mo&s;t awful and overwhelming Judgments upon it, and that he is now gathering in his Elect, to &s;ecure them from the Calamity. The State of the Nation, and of this Land, never looked &s;o threatning of &s;uch a Thing as it does at this Day. The pre&s;ent A&s;pect of Things ex|ceedingly threatens the dying of vital Religion, and even of tho&s;e Truths that are e&s;pecially the Foundation of it, out of this Land, and &s;o God's departing from us. If it &s;hould be &s;o, how awful will the Ca&s;e be with tho&s;e that &s;hall be left, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d not brought in, while God continues the Influences of his Spirit, to gather in tho&s;e that are to be redeemed from among&s;t us!</P>

However friendly you have been together, and have taken Plea&s;ure in one anothers Company, and have often familiarly conver&s;ed together, they will then &s;urely appear again&s;t you. They will ri&s;e up again&s;t you as <HI>Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> and will declare what a precious Opportunity you had, and did not improve; how you continued unbelieving, and rejecting the Offers of a Saviour, when tho&s;e Offers were made in &s;o ex|traordinary a Manner, and when &s;o many others were prevailed upon to accept of Chri&s;t; how you was neg|ligent and &s;lack, and did not know the Things that be|longed to your Peace, in that your Day.

<PB N="168" REF="004239_0175_10042D4C5E8819E0">
You that have been long &s;eeking to enter in at the &s;trait Gate, and yet remain without, now take your Op|portunity and pre&s;s in! You that have been long in the Wilderne&s;s, fighting with various Temptations, and have been labouring under Di&s;couragements, and have been ready to give up the Ca&s;e, have been often tempt|ed to De&s;pair, now, behold the Door that God opens for you! Don't give Way to Di&s;couragements now; this is not a Time for it: Don't &s;pend Time in think|ing that you have done what you can already, and that you &s;ee Signs that you be not elected, and in giving Way to other perplexing, weakening, di&s;heartening Temptations: Don't wa&s;te away this precious Oppor|tunity in &s;uch a Manner: You have no Time to &s;pare for &s;uch Things as the&s;e: God calls you now to &s;ome|thing el&s;e: Improve this Time in &s;eeking and &s;triving for Salvation, and not in that which tends to hinder it. 'Tis no Time now for you to &s;tand talking with the Devil; but hearken to God, and apply your &s;elf to that, which he does now &s;o loudly call you to.</P>
<P>Some of you have often lamented the Lo&s;s of pa&s;t Opportunities: As particularly the Lo&s;s of the Time of Youth, and have been wi&s;hing that you had &s;o good an Opportunity again; have been ready to &s;ay, <HI>O! if I was young again, how would I improve &s;uch an Advan|tage!</HI> That Opportunity that you have had in Time pa&s;t, is irrecoverable; you can never have it again: but God can give you other Advantages of another Sort, that are very great, and he is &s;o doing at this Day. He is now putting a new Opportunity into your Hands; tho' not of the <HI>&s;ame Kind</HI> with that which you once had, and have lo&s;t, yet in &s;ome Re&s;pects as great of <HI>another Kind.</HI> If you lament, and are ready to cry out of your Folly in neglecting and loo&s;ing pa&s;t Opportu|nities, then don't be guilty of the Folly of neglecting the Opportunity which God now gives you. This Opportunity you could not have <HI>purcha&s;ed,</HI> if you would have given all that you had in the World for it: But God is putting of it into your Hands, of him&s;elf, of his own free and &s;overeign Mercy, <HI>without your purcha&s;ing</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="004239_0176_100404B377946C90">
of it. Therefore when you have it, don't neglect it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a great deal more likely with Re&s;pect to &s;uch Per&s;ons than others, that this is their la&s;t Time. There will be a la&s;t Time of any &s;pecial Offer of Salvation to impenitent Sinners. <HI>God's Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with Man,</HI> Gen. 6 3. God &s;ometimes continues long knocking at the Doors of wicked Men's Hearts; but there are the la&s;t Knocks, and the la&s;t Calls, that ever they &s;hall have. And &s;ometimes God's la&s;t Calls are the loude&s;t, and then if Sinners don't hearken, God finally leaves them. How long has God been knocking at ma|ny of your Doors, that are old in Sin! 'Tis a great deal more likely that the&s;e are his la&s;t Knocks. You have re&s;i&s;ted God's Spirit in Times pa&s;t, and have har|den'd your Heart once and again; but God will not be thus dealt with always: There is Danger, that if now, after &s;o long a Time, you won't hearken, he will utterly de&s;ert you, and leave you to walk in your own Coun&s;els.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, by God's Providence, as tho' God had yet an elect Number among&s;t old Sinners in this Place, that perhaps he is now about to bring in. It looks as tho' there were &s;ome that long lived under Mr.<HI>Stoddard'</HI>s Mini&s;try, that God has not utterly ca&s;t off, tho' they &s;o &s;tood it out under &s;uch great Means as they then enjoyed. 'Tis to be hoped that God will now bring in a Remnant from among them. But 'tis the more like|ly that God is now about fini&s;hing with them, one Way or the other, for their having been &s;o long the Subjects of &s;uch extraordinary Means. You have &s;een former T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mes of the pouring out of God's Spirit upon the Town, when others were taken and you left, others were called out of Darkne&s;s into marvellous Light, and were brought into a glorious and happy State, and you was one that &s;aw not Good when Good came. How dark will your Circum&s;tances appear, if you &s;hall al&s;o &s;tand it out through this Opportunity, and &s;till be left behind! Take heed that you be not one of tho&s;e &s;poken of, Heb 6. 7. 8. that are like <HI>the Earth that has Rain coming o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t upon it,

and only bears Briars and Thorns.</HI> As we &s;ee there are &s;ome Pieces of Ground, the more Showers of Rain fall upon them, the more fruitful Sea&s;ons there are, the more do the Briars, and other u&s;ele&s;s and hurtful Plants, that are rooted in them, grow and flouri&s;h. Of &s;uch Ground the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>It is rejected, and is high unto cur&s;ing, who&s;e End is to be burned.</HI> The Way that the Husband|man takes with &s;uch Ground, is to &s;et Fire to it, to burn up the Growth of it.&mdash;If you mi&s;s this Opportunity, there is Danger that you will be utterly <HI>rejected,</HI> and that your <HI>End</HI> will be <HI>to be burned.</HI> And if this is to be, it is to be feared, that you are not <HI>far from,</HI> but <HI>nigh unto Cur&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e of you that are already grown old in Sin, and are now under Awakenings, when you feel your Con|victions begin to go off, if ever that &s;hould be, <HI>then</HI> re|member what you have now been told: It may well <HI>then</HI> &s;trike you to the Heart!</P>
<P>IV. I would direct the Advice to tho&s;e that are Young, and now under their fir&s;t &s;pecial Convictions. I would earne&s;tly urge &s;uch to improve this Opportuni|ty, and pre&s;s into the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider two Things,</P>
<P N="1">1. You have all Manner of Advantages now centring upon you. It is a Time of great Advantage for all; but your Advantages are above others. There is no o|ther Sort of Per&s;ons, that have now &s;o great and happy an Opportunity as you have. You have that great Advantage that is common to all that live in this Place, <HI>viz.</HI> That now it is a Time of the extraordinary pour|ing out of the Spirit of God; and al&s;o have that great Advantage, that you have the awakening Influences of the Spirit of God on you in particular; and be&s;ides that, you have this peculiar Advantage, that you are now in your Youth: And added to this, you have ano|ther un&s;peakable Advantage, that you now are under your fir&s;t Convictions. Happy is he that never has har|dened his Heart, and blocked up his own Way to Hea|ven
<PB N="171" REF="004239_0178_10042D5D10B13180">
by <HI>back&s;liding,</HI> and has now the awakening Influ|ences of God's Spirit, if God does but enable him tho|roughly to improve them! Such above all in the World bid fair for the Kingdom of God. God is wont, on &s;uch, above any Kind of Per&s;ons, as it were ea&s;ily and readily to be&s;tow the &s;aving Grace and Comforts of his Spirit. In&s;tances of &s;peedy and &s;udden Conver&s;ion are mo&s;t commonly found among &s;uch&mdash;Happy are they that have the Spirit of God with them, and never have quenched it, if they did but know the Price they have in their Hands!</P>
<P>If you have a Sen&s;e of your Nece&s;&s;ity of Salvation, and the great Worth and Value of it, you will be wil|ling to take the &s;ure&s;t Way to it, or that which has the greate&s;t Probability of Succe&s;s; and that certainly is, thoroughly to improve your fir&s;t Convictions: If you do &s;o, it is not likely that you will fail; there is the greate&s;t Probability that you will &s;ucceed What is it not worth to have &s;uch an Advantage in ones Hands, for obtaining <HI>eternal Life?</HI>&mdash;The pre&s;ent Sea&s;on of the pouring out of God's Spirit, is the fir&s;t &s;uch Sea&s;on that many of you that are now under Awakenings have ever &s;een, &s;ince you came to Years of Under&s;tand|ing: On which Account, and becau&s;e it is the fir&s;t Time that you have ever been &s;tir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'d up by the Spirit of God your &s;elf, 'tis the greate&s;t Opportunity that ever you have had, and probably by far the greate&s;t that ever you will have. There are many here pre&s;ent that wi&s;h they had &s;uch an Opportunity, but they never can obtain it; they can't buy it for Money; but you have it in your Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and can improve it if you will.</P>
<P>But yet,</P>
<P N="2">2. There is on &s;ome Accounts greater Danger that &s;uch as are in your Circum&s;tances will fail of thoroughly improving their Convictions, with Re&s;pect to Sted&s;a&s;tne&s;s and Per&s;everance, than others. Tho&s;e that are young are more un&s;table than elder Per&s;ons: They that never had Convictions before, have le&s;s Experience of the Difficulty of the Work they have engaged in; they are more ready to think that they &s;hall obtain Salvation
<PB N="172" REF="004239_0179_10042D6575515E48">
ea&s;ily, and are more ea&s;ily di&s;couraged by Di&s;appoint|ments; and young Per&s;ons have le&s;s Rea&s;on and Con&s;i|deration to fortify them again&s;t Temptations to Back|&s;liding: You &s;hould therefore labour now the more to guard again&s;t &s;uch Temptations&mdash;By all Means be thorough now! Make but one Work of &s;eeking Salva|tion! Make thorough Work of it the fir&s;t Time!&mdash;There are va&s;t Di&s;advantages that they bring them&s;elves under, that have &s;everal Turns of Seeking with great Intermi&s;&s;ions: By &s;uch a Cour&s;e Per&s;ons exceedingly wound their own Souls, and intangle them&s;elves in ma|ny Snares.&mdash;Who are tho&s;e that commonly meet with &s;o many Difficulties, and are &s;o long labouring in Darkne&s;s and Perplexity, but tho&s;e that have had &s;everal Turns at &s;eeking Salvation, who have one while had Convictions, and then have quenched them, and then have &s;et about the Work again, and have back|&s;liden again, and have gone on after that Manner? The Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> would not have been forty Years in the Wilderne&s;s, if they had held their Courage, and had gone on as they &s;et out; but they were of an un|&s;table Mind, and were for going back again into <HI>Egypt</HI> Otherwi&s;e if they had gone right forward, without Di&s;|couragement, as God would have led them, they would have &s;oon entred, and taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canaan:</HI> They had got to the very Borders of it, when they turned back, but then were thirty-eight Years after that, before they got through the Wilderne&s;s. Therefore as you regard the Intere&s;t of your Soul, don't run your &s;elf into a like Difficulty, by Un&s;teadine&s;s, Intermi&s;&s;ion, and Back|&s;liding; but pre&s;s right forward, from henceforth, and make but one Work of &s;eeking converting and pardon|ing Grace, however great, and difficult, and long a Work that may be.</P>

<P>_THE Things that we have the Hi&s;tory of in this Book of <HI>Ruth,</HI> &s;eem to be in|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rted into the Canon of the Scripture e&s;pecially on two Accounts.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e Chri&s;t was of <HI>Ruth'</HI>s Po&s;terity. The Holy Gho&s;t thought fit to take particular Notice of that Marriage of <HI>Boaz</HI> with <HI>Ruth,</HI> whence &s;prang the Saviour of the World.&mdash;We may often ob&s;erve it, that the Holy Spirit that indited the Scrip|tures

often takes Notice of little Things, minute Occur|rences, that do but remotely relate to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e this Hi&s;tory &s;eems to be typical of the Calling of the Gentile Church, and indeed of the Conver&s;ion of every Believer. <HI>Ruth</HI> was not original|ly of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> but was a <HI>Moabite&s;s,</HI> an Alien from the Common-Wealth of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> But &s;he for&s;ook her own People, and the Idols of the Gentiles, to wor&s;hip the God of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and to join her &s;elf to that People: Here|in &s;he &s;eems to be a Type of the Gentile Church, and al&s;o of every &s;incere Convert. <HI>Ruth</HI> was the Mother of Chri&s;t; He came of her Po&s;terity: &s;o the Church is Chri&s;t's Mother, as &s;he is repre&s;ented, <HI>Rev</HI> 12. at the Beginning.

<P N="1">1. The remarkable Conduct and Behaviour of <HI>Ruth</HI> on this Occa&s;ion; with what inflexible Re&s;olution &s;he cleaves to <HI>Naomi,</HI> and follows her. When <HI>Naomi</HI> fir&s;t aro&s;e to return from the Country of <HI>Moab,</HI> into the Land

of <HI>I&s;rael, Orpah</HI> and <HI>Ruth both</HI> &s;et out with her: And <HI>Naomi</HI> exhorts them <HI>both</HI> to return: And they <HI>both</HI> of them wept, and &s;eem'd as if they could not bear the Thoughts of leaving her, and appeared as if they were re&s;olved to go with her.

<P N="2">2.

<P>From the Words thus opened, I ob&s;erve this for the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<Q>When tho&s;e that we have formerly been conver&s;ant with, are turning to God, and joining them&s;elves to his Peo|ple, it ought to be our firm Re&s;olution, that we will not leave them; but that their People &s;hall be our People, and their God, our God.</Q>
<P>It is &s;ometimes &s;o, that <HI>of tho&s;e</HI> that have been con|ver&s;ant one with another, that have dwelt together as Neighbours, and have been often together as Compani|ons, or have been united in near Relation, and have been together in Darkne&s;s, Bondage, and Mi&s;ery, in the Service of Satan, <HI>&s;ome</HI> are inlighten'd and have their Minds changed, are made to &s;ee the great Evil of Sin, and have their Hearts turned to God, and are influenced by the Holy Spirit of God, to leave their Company that are on Satan's Side, to go and join them&s;elves with that ble&s;&s;ed Company that are with Je&s;us Chri&s;t; they are made willing to for&s;ake the Tents of Wickedne&s;s, to dwell in the Land of Uprightne&s;s, with the People of God.</P>
<P>And &s;ometimes this proves a final Parting or Sepera|tion between them, and tho&s;e that they have been for|merly conver&s;ant with. Though it may be no Parting in outward Re&s;pects, they may &s;till dwell together, and may conver&s;e one with another, yet in other Re&s;pects it &s;ets them at a great Di&s;tance one from another: one is a <HI>Child</HI> of God, and the other the <HI>Enemy</HI> of God; one is in a mi&s;erable, and the other in a happy Condi|tion; one is a Citizen of the heavenly <HI>Zion,</HI> the other is under Condemnation to He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l. They are no longer together in tho&s;e Re&s;pects, wherein they u&s;ed to be to|gether: They u&s;ed to be of one Mind to &s;erve Sin, and

do Satan's Work; now they are of contrary Minds: They u&s;ed to be together in Worldline&s;s, and &s;inful Vanity; now they are of exceeding different Di&s;po&s;iti|ons. They are &s;eperated as they are in different King|doms; the one remains in the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s, the other is tran&s;lated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son. And &s;ometimes they are <HI>finally</HI> &s;eperated in the&s;e Re&s;pects: while one dwells in the Land of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and in the Hou&s;e of God; the other, like <HI>Orpah,</HI> lives and dies in the Land of <HI>Moab.</HI></P>
<P>Now 'tis lamentable when it is thus: 'Tis awful be|ing parted <HI>&s;o:</HI> 'Tis doleful when of tho&s;e that have for|merly been together in Sin, &s;ome turn to God, and join them&s;elves with his People, that it &s;hould prove a Part|ing between them and their former Companions and Acquaintance.&mdash;It &s;hould be our firm and inflexible Re&s;olution in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, that it &s;hall be no Parting, but that we will follow them, that their People &s;hall be our People, and their God our God; and that for the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>I. Becau&s;e <HI>their God</HI> is a glorious God. There is none like him, who is infinite in Glory and Excel|lency: He is the mo&s;t high God, glorious in Holine&s;s, fearful in Prai&s;es, doing Wonders: His Name is excel|lent in all the Earth, and his Glory is above the Earth and the Heavens: Among the God's there is none like unto him; there is none in Heaven to be compared to him, nor are there any among the Sons of the Mighty, that can be liken'd unto him.&mdash;Their God is the Fountain of all Good, &amp; an inexhau&s;tible Fountain; he is an al&s;ufficient God; a God that is able to protect and defend them, and do all Things for them: He is the King of Glory, the Lord &s;trong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle: A &s;trong Rock, and an high Tower. There is none like the God of <HI>Je&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urun,</HI> who rideth on the Heaven in their Help, and in his Excellency on the Sky: The <HI>eternal God</HI> is their Refuge, and under|neath are everla&s;ting Arms: He is a God that hath all Things in his Hand, and does what&s;over he plea&s;es:
<PB N="178" REF="004239_0185_10042D81AB161338">
He killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to the Grave, and bringeth up; he maketh poor, and maketh rich: The Pillars of the Earth are the Lord's.&mdash;Their God is an infinitely holy God: There is none holy as the Lord. And he is infinitely good and merciful. Ma|ny that others wor&s;hip and &s;erve as God's, are cruel Be|ings, Spirits that &s;eek the Ruin of Souls; but this is a God that delighteth in Mercy; his Grace is infinite, and endures for ever: He is Love it &s;elf, an infinite Fountain and Ocean of it.</P>
<P>Such a God is their God! Such is the Excellency of <HI>Jacob!</HI> Such is the God of them, who have for&s;aken their Sins and are converted! They have made a wi&s;e Choice, who have cho&s;en this God for their God. They have made an happy Exchange <HI>indeed,</HI> that have exchanged Sin, and the World, for &s;uch a God!</P>
<P>They have an excellent and glorious Saviour, who is the only begotten Son of God; the Brightne&s;s of his Father's Glory; one in whom God from Eternity had infinite Delight; A Saviour of infinite Love; one that has &s;hed his own Blood, and made his Soul an Offering for their Sins; and one that is able to &s;ave them to the uttermo&s;t.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Their People</HI> are an excellent and happy People. God has renewed them, and in&s;tamped his own Image upon them, and made them Partakers of his Holine&s;s. They are more excellent than their Neighbours, <HI>Prov.</HI> 12. 26 Yea, they are the excellent of the Earth, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 16. 3 They are lovely in the Sight of the Angels; and they have their Souls adorned with tho&s;e Graces, that in the Sight of God him &s;elf are of great Price.</P>
<P>The People of God are the mo&s;t excellent and hap|py Society in the World. That God whom they have cho&s;en for their God, is their Father; he has pardoned all their Sins, and they are at Peace with him; and he has admitted them to all the Privileges of his Children. As they have devoted them&s;elves to God, &s;o God has given him&s;elf to them: He is become their Salvation, and their Portion: His Power and Mercy, and all his
<PB N="179" REF="004239_0186_10042D8B168A2440">
Attributes are theirs. They are in a &s;afe State, free from all Po&s;&s;ibility of peri&s;hing: Satan has no Pow|er to de&s;troy them. God carries them on Eagles Wings, far above Satan's Reach, and above the Reach of all the Enemies of their Souls. God is with them <HI>in this World;</HI> they have his gracious Pre&s;ence: God is for them; Who then can be again&s;t them? As the Moun|tains are round about <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;o JEHOVAH is round about them. God is their Shield, and their exceeding great Reward; and their Fellow&s;hip is with the Father, and with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t: And they have the di|vine Promi&s;e and Oath, that <HI>in the World to come,</HI> they &s;hall dwell for ever in the glorious Pre&s;ence of God.</P>
<P>It may well be &s;ufficient to induce us to re&s;olve to cleave to tho&s;e that for&s;ake their Sins and Idols, to join them&s;elves with this People, that God is with them. Zech. 8 23 <HI>Thus faith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, In tho&s;e Days it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that ten Men &s;hall take hold, out of all Languages of the Nations; even &s;hall take hold of the Skirt of him that is a Jew, &s;aying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you.</HI> So &s;hould Per|&s;ons, as it were take hold of the Skirt of their. Neigh|bours and Companions, that have turn'd to God, and re&s;olve that they will go with them, becau&s;e God is with them.</P>
<P>III. Happine&s;s is no where el&s;e to be had, but in <HI>their God,</HI> and with <HI>their People.</HI> There are that are called gods many, and lords many. Some make gods of their Plea&s;ures; &s;ome choo&s;e Mammon for their god; &s;ome make gods of their own &s;uppo&s;ed Excellencies, or the outward Advantages they have above their Neigh|bours; &s;ome choo&s;e one Thing for their god, and o|thers another: But Men can be happy in no other God, but the God of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> He is the only Fountain of Happine&s;s. Other gods can't help in Calamity; nor can any of them afford what the poor empty Soul &s;tands in need of. Let Men adore tho&s;e other gods never &s;o much, and call upon them never &s;o earne&s;tly, and &s;erve
<PB N="180" REF="004239_0187_10042D8E5B05D8C0">
them never &s;o diligently, they will never the le&s;s re|main poor, wretched, un&s;atisfied, undone Creatures. All other People are mi&s;erable, but that People who&s;e God is the Lord.&mdash;The World is divided into two Societies: There are the People of God, the little Flock of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that Company that we read of, Rev. 14. 4. <HI>The&s;e are they, which were not defiled with Women; for they are Virgins: The&s;e are they, which follow the Lamb whither&s;oever he g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eth: The&s;e were re|deemed from among Men, being the fir&s;t Fruits unto God, and to the Lamb.</HI> And there are tho&s;e that belong to the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s; that are without Chri&s;t, be|ing Aliens from the Common-Wealth of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Stran|gers from the Covenants of Promi&s;e, having no Hope, and without God in the World. All that are of this latter Company, are wretched and undone; they are the Enemies of God, and under his Wrath and Condemna|tion: They are the Devil's Slaves, that &s;erve him blind|fold, and are be&s;ool'd, and en&s;nared by him, and hurri|ed along in the broad Way to eternal Perdition.</P>
<P>IV. When tho&s;e that we have formerly been con|ver&s;ant with, are turning to God, and to his People, <HI>their Example</HI> ought to influence us. Their Example &s;hould be looked upon as the Call of God to us, to do as they have done. God, when he changes the Heart of one, calls upon another; e&s;pecially does he loudly call on tho&s;e that have been their Friends and Acquain|tance.&mdash;We have been influenced by their Exam|ples in Evil; and &s;hall we cea&s;e to follow them, when they make the wi&s;e&s;t Choice that ever they made, and do the be&s;t Thing that ever they did! If we have been Companions with them in Worldline&s;s, in Vanity, in unpro&s;itable and &s;inful Conver&s;ation, it will be an hard Ca&s;e, if there mu&s;t be a Parting now, becau&s;e we be not willing to be Companions with them in Holi|ne&s;s, and true Happine&s;s. Men are greatly influenced by &s;eeing one another's Pro&s;perity in other Things. If tho&s;e that they have been much conver&s;ant with, grow rich, and obtain any great earthly Advantages, it awa|kens
<PB N="181" REF="004239_0188_10042D95ED8C7A08">
their Ambition, and eager De&s;ire after the like Pro&s;perity: How much more &s;hould they be influen|ced, and &s;tirred up to follow them, and be like them, when they obtain that &s;piritual and eternal Happine&s;s, that is infinitely more Worth than all the Pro&s;perity and Glory of this World.</P>
<P>V. Our Re&s;olutions to cleave to and follow tho&s;e that are turning to God, and joining them&s;elves to his Peo|ple, ought to be <HI>fix'd</HI> and <HI>&s;trong,</HI> becau&s;e of the great Difficulty of it. If we will cleave to them, and have their God for our God, and their People for our Peo|ple, we mu&s;t mortify and deny all our Lu&s;ts, and cro&s;s every evil Appetite and Inclination, and forever part with all Sin. But our Lu&s;ts are many and violent. Sin is naturally exceeding dear to us; to part with it is compared to plucking out our right Eyes. Men may re|frain from wanted Ways of Sin, for a little while, and may deny their Lu&s;ts in a partial Degree, with le&s;s Difficulty; but 'tis heart-rending Work, finally to part with all Sin, and to give our deare&s;t Lu&s;ts a Bill of Di|vorce, utterly to &s;end them away. But this we mu&s;t do, if we would follow tho&s;e that are truly turning to God: Yea, we mu&s;t not only for&s;ake Sin, but mu&s;t, in a Sen&s;e, for&s;ake all the World, Luke 14. 33 <HI>Who&s;o|ever he be of you, that for&s;aketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI> That is, he mu&s;t for&s;ake all <HI>in his Heart,</HI> and mu&s;t come to a thorough Di&s;po&s;ition and Readine&s;s, <HI>actually</HI> to quit all for God, and the glo|rious &s;piritual Privileges of his People, whenever the Ca&s;e may require it; and that without any Pro&s;pect of any Thing of the like Nature, or any worldly Thing what&s;oever, to make amends for it; and all to go into a &s;trange Country, a Land that has hitherto been un|&s;een; like <HI>Abraham,</HI> who being called of God, <HI>went out of his own Country, and from his Kindred, and from his Father's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;e for a Land that God &s;hould &s;hew him, not knowing whither he went.</HI></P>
<P>Thus&punc; it was an hard Thing for <HI>Ruth</HI> to for&s;ake her native Country, &amp; her Father &amp; Mother, her Kindred and
<PB N="182" REF="004239_0189_10042D9AC0D326B0">
Acquaintance, and all the plea&s;ant Things &s;he had in the Land of <HI>Moab,</HI> to dwell in the Land of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> where &s;he never had been. <HI>Naomi</HI> told her of the Dif|ficulties once and again They were too hard for her Si&s;ter <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h;</HI> the Con&s;ideration of them turned her back after &s;he was &s;et out. Her R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;olution was not firm enough to overcome them. But &s;o firmly re&s;olved was <HI>Ruth,</HI> that &s;he brake through all; &s;he was &s;tedfa&s;t in it, that let the Difficulty be what it would, &s;he would not leave her Mother in law. So Per&s;ons had need to be very firm in their Re&s;olution to conquer the Difficulties that are in the Way of cleaving to them, that are indeed turning from Sin to God.</P>
<P>VI. Our cleaving to them, and having their God for our God, and their People for our People, depends on our Re&s;olution and Choice: And that in two Re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Firmne&s;s of Re&s;olution in u&s;ing Means in order to it, is <HI>the Way to have Means effectual.</HI> There are Means appointed in order to our becoming &s;ome of the true <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and having their God for our God; and the <HI>thorough</HI> U&s;e of the&s;e Means, is the Way to have Succe&s;s; but not a <HI>&s;lack</HI> or <HI>&s;lighty</HI> U&s;e of them. And that we may be thorough, there is need of Strength of Re&s;olution, a firm and inflexible Di&s;po&s;ition, and bent of Mind to be univer&s;al in the U&s;e of Means, and to do what we do with our Might, and to per&s;evere in it. Matth. 11. 12. <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven &s;uffereth Vi|olence, and the violent take it by Force.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A choo&s;ing of their God, and their People, with a full Determination, and with the whole Soul, is <HI>the Con|dition of an Union with them.</HI> God gives every Man his Choice in this Matter; as <HI>Orpah</HI> and <HI>Ruth</HI> had their Choice, whether they would go with <HI>Naomi</HI> into the Land of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> or &s;tay in the Land of <HI>Moab.</HI> A natu|ral Man may choo&s;e Deliverance from Hell; but no Man doth ever heartily choo&s;e God, and Chri&s;t, and the &s;piritu|al Benefits that Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed, and the Happine&s;s of God's People, till he is converted. On the contrary,

He is aver&s;e to them; he has no Reli&s;h of them; and is wholly ignorant of the ine&s;timable Worth and Value of them.</P>
<P>Many carnal Men do &s;eem to choo&s;e the&s;e Things, but do it not really; as <HI>O pah</HI> &s;eemed at fir&s;t. to choo&s;e to for&s;ake <HI>Moab</HI> to go into the Land of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> But when <HI>Naomi</HI> come to &s;et before her the Difficulty of it, &s;he went back; and thereby &s;hewed that &s;he was not fully determined in her Choice, and that her whole Soul was not in it, as <HI>Ruth'</HI>s was.</P>

<P>The USE that I &s;hall make of what has been &s;aid, is to move Sinners to this Re&s;olution, with Re&s;pect to tho&s;e among&s;t us, that have lately turned to God, and joined them&s;elves to the Flock of Chri&s;t. It is &s;o, thro' the abundant Mercy and Grace of God to us in this Place, that it may be &s;aid of many of you, that are in a Chri&s;tle&s;s Condition, that you have lately been left by tho&s;e that were formerly with you in &s;uch a State. There are tho&s;e that you have formerly been conver&s;ant with, that have lately for&s;aken a Life of Sin and the Service of Satan, and have turned to God, and fled to Chri&s;t, and joined them&s;elves to that ble&s;&s;ed Company that are with him. They formerly were with you in Sin and in Mi&s;ery, but now they are with you no more, in that State or Manner of Life: They are changed, and have fled from the Wrath to come: They have cho&s;en a Life of Holine&s;s here, and the Enjoyment of God hereafter. They were formerly your A&s;&s;ociates in Bondage, and were with you in Sa|tan's Bu&s;ine&s;s; but now you have their Company no longer, in the&s;e Things. Many of you have &s;een tho&s;e that you live with under the &s;ame Roof, turning from being any longer with you in Sin, to be with the Peo|ple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Some of you that are Husbands, have had your Wives; and &s;ome of you that are Wives, have had you Husbands; &s;ome of you that are Chil|dren, have had your Parents; and Parents have had

your Children; many of you have had your Brothers and Si&s;ters; and many your near Neighbours, and Ac|quaintance, and &s;pecial Friends; many of you that are young have had your Companions: I &s;ay, many of you have had tho&s;e that you have been thus concerned with, leaving you, for&s;aking that doleful Life, and wretched State that you &s;till continue in. God of his good Plea|&s;ure, and wonderful Grace, hath lately cau&s;ed it to be &s;o, in this Place, that Multitudes have been for&s;aking their old Abodes in the Land of <HI>Moab,</HI> and under the gods of <HI>Moab,</HI> and going into the Land of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to put their Tru&s;t under the Wings of the Lord God of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Though you and they have been nearly related, and have dwelt together, or have been often together, and intimately acquainted one with another, they have been taken, and you hitherto left! O let it not be the Foun|dation of a final Parting! But earne&s;tly follow them; be firm in your Re&s;olution in this Matter. Don't do as <HI>Orpah</HI> did, who though at fir&s;t &s;he made as though &s;he would follow <HI>Naomi,</HI> yet when &s;he had the Difficulty of it &s;et before her, went back: But &s;ay as <HI>Ruth, I will not leave thee, but where thou go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t, I will go: Thy People &s;hall be my People, and thy God my God.</HI> Say as &s;he &s;aid, and do as &s;he did. Con&s;ider the Excellency of their God, and their Saviour, and the Happine&s;s of their Peo|ple, the ble&s;&s;ed State that they are in, and the doleful State that you are in.</P>
<P>You that are old Sinners, that have lived long in the Service of Satan, have lately &s;een &s;ome that were <HI>with you,</HI> that have travell'd <HI>with you</HI> in the Paths of Sin, the&s;e many Years, that <HI>with you</HI> enjoyed great Means and Advantages, that have had Calls and Warnings <HI>with you,</HI> and have <HI>with you</HI> pa&s;s'd through remarkable Times of the pouring out of God's Spirit in this Place, and have harden'd their Hearts, and &s;tood it out <HI>with you,</HI> and <HI>with you</HI> have grown old in Sin; I &s;ay, you have &s;een &s;ome of them turning to God, i. e. you have &s;een tho&s;e Evidences of it in them, whence you may ratio|nally judge that it is &s;o.

<P>You that tell of your having been &s;eeking Salvation for many Years, though, without Doubt, in a poor, dull Way, in compari&s;on of what you ought to have done. You have &s;een &s;ome that have been with you in that Re&s;pect, that were old Sinners, and old Seekers, as you are, obtaining Mercy. God has lately rou&s;ed them from their Dulne&s;s, and cau&s;ed them to alter their Hand, and put them on more thorough Endeavours; and they have now, after &s;o long a Time heard God's Voice, and have fled for Refuge to the Rock of Ages. Let this awaken Earne&s;tne&s;s, and Re&s;olution in you. Re&s;olve that you will not leave them.</P>
<P>You that are in your Youth, how many have you &s;een of your Age and Standing, that have of late, hopefully cho&s;en God for their God, and Chri&s;t for their Saviour!

<P>You that are great Sinners, that have made your &s;elves di&s;tingui&s;hingly guilty, by the wicked Practices you have lived in, there are &s;ome of your Sort, that have lately (as we have Rea&s;on to hope) had their Hearts broken for Sin, and have for&s;aken it, and have tru&s;ted in the Blood of Chri&s;t for the Pardon of it, and have cho&s;en an holy Life, and have betaken them&s;elves to the Ways of Wi&s;dom: Let it ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> and encourage you, re&s;olutely to cleave to them, and earne&s;tly to follow, them.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="004239_0193_10042DB0A12590B0">
Let the following Things be here con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. That your Soul is as precious as theirs. It is im|mortal as theirs is; and &s;tands in as much Need of Hap|pine&s;s, and can as ill bear eternal Mi&s;ery. You was born in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> mi&s;erable Condition that they were, having the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Wrath of God abiding on you. You mu&s;t &s;tand before the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Judge; who will be as &s;trict in Judgment with you, as with them; and your own Righteou&s;ne&s;s will &s;tand you in no more Stead before him, than theirs; and therefore you &s;tand in as ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of a Saviour as they. Carnal Confidences can no more an&s;wer your End than theirs; nor can this World or it's Enjoyments, &s;erve to make you happy, without God, and Chri&s;t, more than them. When the Bridegroom comes, the fooli&s;h Virgins &s;tand in as much Need of Oil, as the Wi&s;e, <HI>Matth.</HI>25 at the Beginning.</P>
<P N="2">2. Unle&s;s you follow them, in their turning to God, their Conver&s;ion will be a Foundation of an eternal Se|peration between you and them. You will be in differ|ent Intere&s;ts, and in exceeding different States, as long as you live; they the Children of God, and you the Children of Satan: and you will be parted in another World; when you come to <HI>die,</HI> there will be a va&s;t Seperation made between you. Luke 16. 26. <HI>And be|&s;ides all this, between us and you, there is a great Gulf fixed; &s;o that they that would pa&s;s from hence to you, can|not; neither can they pa&s;s to us, that would come from thence.</HI> And you will be parted at the Day of Judg|ment. You will be parted at Chri&s;t's fir&s;t Appearance in the Clouds of Heaven: While they are caught up in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air, to be ever with the Lord, you will remain <HI>below,</HI> confined to this cur&s;ed Ground, that is kept in Store, re&s;erved unto Fire, again&s;t the Day of Judgment, and Perdition of ungodly Men. You will appear &s;eperated from them, while you &s;tand before the great Judgment Seat, they being at the Right Hard, while you are &s;et at the left. Matth. 25. 32, 33. <HI>And before him &s;hall be gathered all Nations; and he &s;hall &s;eperate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth his Sheep from the Goats; and he &s;hall

<P>_THE main Subject of the doctrinal Part of this Epi&s;tle, is the free Grace of God, in the Salvation of Men by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; e&s;pecially as it appears in the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone. And the more clearly to evince this Doctrine, and &s;hew the Rea&s;on of it, the Apo&s;tle, in the fir&s;t Place, e&s;tab|li&s;hes that Point, that no Fle&s;h living can be ju&s;tified by the Deeds of the Law. And to prove it, he is very large and particular in &s;hewing, that all Mankind, not only Gentiles, but Jews, are <HI>under Sin,</HI> and &s;o under
<PB N="193" REF="004239_0200_100405500705AF08">
the Condemnation of the Law; which is what he in&s;i&s;ts upon from the beginning of the Epi&s;tle to this Place. He fir&s;t begins with the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and in the fir&s;t Chapter, &s;hews that they are <HI>under Sin,</HI> by &s;etting forth the exceeding Corruptions and horrid Wickedne&s;s, that over&s;pread the Gentile World: And then through the &s;econd Chapter, and the former Part of this third Chap|ter, to the Text and following Ver&s;e, he &s;hews the &s;ame of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they al&s;o are in the &s;ame Cir|cum&s;tances with the Gentiles, in this regard. They had an high Thought of them&s;elves, becau&s;e they were God's Covenant People, and circumci&s;ed, and the Chil|dren of <HI>Abraham.</HI> They de&s;pi&s;ed the Gentiles, as pol|luted, condemned, and accur&s;ed; but looked on them|&s;elves, on Account of their external Privileges, and ce|remonial and moral Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as a pure and holy People, and the Children of God; as the Apo&s;tle ob|&s;erves in the &s;econd Chapter. It was therefore &s;trange Doctrine to them, that they al&s;o were unclean and guil|ty in God's Sight, and under the Condemnation and Cur&s;e of the Law. The Apo&s;tle does therefore, on Ac|count of their &s;trong Prejudices again&s;t &s;uch Doctrine, the more particularly in&s;i&s;t upon it, and &s;hews that they are no better than the Gentiles; as in the 9th Ver&s;e of this Chapter, <HI>What then? Are we better than they? No in no wi&s;e; for we have before proved both Jews and Gen|tiles, that they are all under Sin.</HI> And to convince them of it, he then produces certain Pa&s;&s;ages out of their own Law, or the Old-Te&s;tament, (who&s;e Authority they pretended a great Regard to,) from the 9th Ver&s;e to the Ver&s;e wherein is our Text. And it may be ob&s;er|ved, that the Apo&s;tle, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> cites certain Pa&s;&s;ages to prove that Mankind are <HI>all</HI> corrupt, in the 10, 11, and 12. Ver&s;es; as it is written, <HI>There is</HI> none <HI>righteous, no</HI> not one: <HI>There is</HI> none <HI>that under&s;tandeth: There is</HI> none <HI>that &s;eeketh after God: They are</HI> all <HI>gone out of the Way: They are</HI> together <HI>become unprofitable: There is</HI> none <HI>that doth good; no</HI> not one. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Pa&s;&s;a|ges he cites next, are to prove that not only are <HI>all</HI> corrupt, but each one <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">lly</HI> corrupt, as it were
<PB N="194" REF="004239_0201_100409B11025F4F8">
all over unclean, from the crown of his Head, to the Soles of his Feet; and therefore &s;everal particular Parts of the Body are mentioned, as the <HI>Throat,</HI> the <HI>Tongue,</HI> the <HI>Lips,</HI> the <HI>Mouth,</HI> the <HI>Feet,</HI> Ver&s;es 13, 14, 15. <HI>Their</HI> Throat <HI>is an open Sepulchre, with their</HI> Tongues <HI>they have u&s;ed Deceit, the Poi&s;on of A&s;ps is under their</HI> Lips; <HI>who&s;e</HI> Mouth <HI>is full of Cur&s;ing and Bitterne&s;s, their</HI> Feet <HI>are &s;wift to &s;hed Blood.</HI> And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> He quotes other Pa&s;&s;ages to &s;hew, that <HI>each one</HI> is not only <HI>all over</HI> corrupt, but corrupt <HI>to a de&s;perate Degree,</HI> in the 16, 17, and 18. Ver&s;es; in which the exceeding Degree of their Corruption is &s;hewn, both by <HI>affirming</HI> and <HI>denying:</HI> By <HI>affirmatively</HI> expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t pernicious Nature and Tendency of their Wickedne&s;s, in the 16. Ver&s;e. <HI>De|&s;truction and Mi&s;ery are in their Ways</HI> And then by <HI>de|nying</HI> all Good, or Godline&s;s, of them, in the 17, &amp; 18, Ver&s;es, <HI>And the Way of Peace have they not known: There is no Fear of God before their Eyes.</HI> And then, le&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;hould think the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of their Law don't concern them, and that only the <HI>Gentiles</HI> are in|tended in them, the Apo&s;tle &s;hews in the Ver&s;e of the Text, not only that <HI>they</HI> are not exempt, but that <HI>they</HI> e&s;pecially mu&s;t be under&s;tood, <HI>Now we know, that what&s;oever Things the Law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them that are under the Law.</HI> By tho&s;e that are <HI>under the Law,</HI> is meant the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> by tho&s;e that are <HI>without Law;</HI> as appears by the 12th Ver&s;e of the preceeding Chapter. There is &s;pecial Rea&s;on to under&s;tand the Law, as &s;peaking <HI>to</HI> and <HI>of</HI> them, to whom it was imme|diately given. And therefore the <HI>Jews</HI> would be un|rea&s;onable in exempting them&s;elves. And if we exa|mine the Places of the Old Te&s;tament, whence the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages are taken, we &s;hall &s;ee plainly that &s;pecial Re|&s;pect is had to the Wickedne&s;s of the People of that Nation, in every one of them. So that the Law &s;huts all up in univer&s;al and de&s;perate Wickedne&s;s, <HI>that every Mouth may be &s;topped.</HI> The Mouths of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e Pri|vileges by which they were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Gentiles,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="004239_0202_100409B72620D570">
The Things that the Law &s;ays, are &s;ufficient to &s;top the Mouths of all Mankind, in two Re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. To &s;top them from <HI>boa&s;ting</HI> of their Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, as the <HI>Jews</HI> were wont to do; as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in the 23. Ver&s;e of the preceeding Chapter.&mdash;That the Apo&s;tle has Re&s;pect to &s;topping their Mouths in this Re&s;pect, appears by the 27th Ver&s;e of the Context, <HI>Where is Boa&s;ting then? It is excluded.</HI> The Law &s;tops our Mouths from making of any Plea for Life, or the Favour of God, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> any po&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ive Good, from our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;top them from making any <HI>Excu&s;e</HI> for our &s;elves, or <HI>Objection</HI> again&s;t the Execution of the Sentence of the Law, or the Infliction of the Puni&s;hment that it threatens. That this is intended, appears by the Words immediately following, <HI>That all the World may become guilty before God.</HI> That is that they may <HI>appear</HI> to be guilty, and &s;tand convicted before God, and ju&s;tly lia|ble to the Condemnation of his Law, as <HI>guilty of Death,</HI> according to the jewi&s;h Way of Speaking.</P>
<P>And thus the Apo&s;tle proves that no Fle&s;h can be ju&s;tified in God's Sight, by the Deeds of the Law; as he draws the Conclu&s;ion in the following Ver&s;e; and &s;o prepares the Way for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of the great Doc|trine of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, which he proceeds to do, in the next Ver&s;e to that, and in the following Part of the Chapter, and of the Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
<HI>'Tis ju&s;t with God eternally to ca&s;t off, and de&s;troy Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;For this is the Puni&s;hment which the Law con|demns to; which the Things that the Law &s;ays may well &s;top every Mouth from all Manner of Objection again&s;t.</P>
<P>The Truth of this Doctrine may appear, by the joint Con&s;ideration of two Things, <HI>viz. Man' Sinfulne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>God's Sovereignty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="004239_0203_100409B8B21E6220">
I. It appears from the Con&s;ideration of Man's Sinful|ne&s;s. And that whether we con&s;ider <HI>the infinitely evil Nature of all Sin,</HI> or <HI>how much Sin Men are guilty of.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. If we con&s;ider the infinite Evil, and Heinou&s;ne&s;s of Sin in general. 'Tis not unju&s;t in God to inflict what Puni&s;hment is de&s;erved; becau&s;e the very Notion of de&s;erving any Puni&s;hment is, that it may be ju&s;tly in|flicted: A de&s;erved Puni&s;hment and a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment are the &s;ame Thing. To &s;ay that one de&s;erves &s;uch a Puni&s;hment, and yet to &s;ay that he don't ju&s;tly de&s;erve it, is a Contradiction; and if he ju&s;tly de&s;erves it, then it may be ju&s;tly inflicted.</P>
<P>Every Crime or Fault de&s;erves a greater or le&s;&s;er Pu|ni&s;hment, in Proportion as the Crime it &s;elf is greater or le&s;s. If any Fault de&s;erves Puni&s;hment, then &s;o much the greater the Fault, &s;o much the greater is the Puni&s;hment de&s;erved. The faulty Nature of any Thing, is the formal Ground and Rea&s;on of its De&s;ert of Puni&s;hment; and therefore the more any Thing hath of this Nature, the more Puni&s;hment it de&s;erves. And therefore the Terriblene&s;s of the Degree of Puni&s;hment, let it be never &s;o terrible, is no Argu|ment again&s;t the Ju&s;tice of it, if the Proportion does but hold, between the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of the Crime, and the Dreadfulne&s;s of the Puni&s;hment. So that if there be any &s;uch Thing as a Fault infinitely Heinous, it will follow that 'tis ju&s;t to inflict a Puni&s;hment for it, that is infinitely dreadful.</P>
<P>A Crime is more or le&s;s Heinous, according as we are under greater or le&s;&s;er Obligations to the contrary. This is &s;elf-evident, becau&s;e it is herein that the Cri|minalne&s;s, or Faultine&s;s of any Thing con&s;i&s;ts, that it is contrary to what we are obliged or bound to, or what ought to be in us. So the Faultine&s;s of one Beings ha|ting another, is in Proportion to his Obligation to love him: The Crime of one Beings de&s;pi&s;ing, and ca&s;ting Contempt on another, is proportionably more or le&s;s Heinous as he was under greater or le&s;&s;er Obligations to honour him: The Fault of di&s;obeying another, is greater or le&s;s,
<PB N="197" REF="004239_0204_100404F76065B768">
as any one is under greater or le&s;&s;er Obligations to obey him. And therefore if there be any Being, that we are under infinite Obligations to love, and honour, and obey, the Contrary towards him mu&s;t be infinitely Faulty.</P>
<P>Our Obligation to love, honour, and obey any Being, is in Proportion to his Loveline&s;s, Honourablene&s;s, and Authority. For that is the very Meaning of the Words, when we &s;ay any one is very lovely; it is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that he is one very much to be loved: Or if we &s;ay &s;uch an one is more honourable than another; the Meaning of the Words is, that he is one that we are more obliged to honour. If we &s;ay any one has great Authority over us, 'tis the &s;ame as to &s;ay that he has great Right to our Subjection and Obedience.</P>
<P>But God is a Being infinitely lovely, becau&s;e he hath infinite Excellency and Beauty. To have infinite Excel|lency and Beauty, is the &s;ame Thing as to have infinite Loveline&s;s. He is a Being of infinite Greatne&s;s, Maje&s;|ty and Glory; and therefore is infinitely honourable. He is infinitely exalted above the greate&s;t Potentates of the Earth, and highe&s;t Angels in Heaven; and there|fore is infinitely more honourable than they. His Au|thority over us is infinite; and the Ground of his Right to our Obedience, is infinitely &s;trong; for he is infi|nitely worthy to be obeyed in him&s;elf, and we have an ab&s;olute univer&s;al and infinite Dependence upon him.</P>
<P>So that Sin again&s;t God being a Violation of infinite Obligations, mu&s;t be a Crime infinitely heinous; and &s;o de&s;erving of infinite Puni&s;hment.&mdash;Nothing is more agreable to the common Sen&s;e of Mankind, than that Sins committed again&s;t any one, mu&s;t be proporti|onably heinous, to the Dignity of the Being offended and abu&s;ed; as 'tis al&s;o agreable to the Word of God. 1 Sam. 2 25. <HI>If one Man &s;in again&s;t another, the Judge &s;hall judge him;</HI> (i. e. &s;hall judge him, and inflict a finite Puni&s;hment, &s;uch as finite Judges can inflict;) <HI>but if a Man &s;in again&s;t the Lord. Who &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for him!</HI> This was the Aggravation of Sin that made <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> afraid
<PB N="198" REF="004239_0205_100409BDA89C35B0">
of it, Gen 39 9. <HI>How &s;hall I commit this great Wicked|ne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t God?</HI> This was the Aggravation of <HI>David's</HI> Sin, in compari&s;on of which he e&s;teemed all others as nothing, becau&s;e they were infinitely exceeded by it. P&s;alm 51. 4 <HI>Again&s;t thee,</HI> thee only have I &s;inned.&mdash;The Eternity of the Puni&s;hment of ungodly Men renders it infinite; and it renders it no more than infinite; and therefore renders no more than proportionable to the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of what they are guilty of.</P>
<P>If there be <HI>any Evil</HI> or Faultine&s;s in Sin again&s;t God, there is certainly <HI>infinite Evil:</HI> For if it be any Fault at all, it has an infinite Aggravation, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is a|gain&s;t an infinite Object. If it be ever &s;o &s;mall upon other Accounts; yet if it be any Thing, it has <HI>one</HI> infi|nite Dimen&s;ion; and &s;o is an infinite Evil. Which may be illu&s;trated by this: If we &s;uppo&s;e a Thing to have infinite Length, but no Breadth and Thickne&s;s, but to be only a meer mathematical Line, it is nothing: But if it have any Breadth and Thickne&s;s at all, tho' never &s;o &s;mall, yet if it have but one infinite Dimen&s;i|on, <HI>viz.</HI> that of Length, the Quantity of it is infinite; it exceeds the Quantity of any Thing, however broad, thick and long, wherein the&s;e Dimen&s;ions are all finite.</P>
<P>So that the Objections that are made again&s;t the infi|nite Puni&s;hment of Sin, from the Nece&s;&s;ity, or rather previous Certainty of the Futurition of Sin, ari&s;ing from the Decree of God, or unavoidable original Corruption of Nature, if they argue any Thing, don't argue again&s;t the <HI>Infinitene&s;s of the Degree</HI> of the Faultine&s;s of Sin <HI>di|rectly,</HI> and <HI>no otherwi&s;e</HI> than they argue again&s;t <HI>any</HI> Faultine&s;s <HI>at all:</HI> For if this Nece&s;&s;ity or Certainty, leaves any Evil at all in Sin, that Fault mu&s;t be infi|nite by Rea&s;on of the infinite Object.</P>
<P>But every &s;uch Objector, as would argue from hence, that there is no Fault at all in Sin&punc; confutes him&s;elf, and &s;hews his own In&s;incerity in his Objection. For at the &s;ame Time that he objects, that Men's Acts are nece&s;&s;a|ry, from God's Decrees, and original Sin, and that this
<PB N="199" REF="004239_0206_100409C0495A7C48">
Kind of Nece&s;&s;ity is incon&s;i&s;tent with Faultine&s;s in the Act, his own Practice &s;hews that he don't believe what he objects to be true: Otherwi&s;e why does he at all blame Men? Or why are &s;uch Per&s;ons at all di&s;plea&s;ed with Men, for abu&s;ive, injurious, and ungrateful Acts towards them? Whatever they pretend, by this they &s;hew that indeed they do believe that there is no Ne|ce&s;&s;ity in Men's Acts, from divine Decrees, or Corrupti|on of Nature, that is incon&s;i&s;tent with Blame.

<P>If it be &s;aid that God need not have interpo&s;ed to render it impo&s;&s;ible for Man to &s;in, and yet not leave it to meer Contingence, or blind Chance, neither; but might have left it with Man's free Will, to determine whether to &s;in or no: I an&s;wer, If God did leave it to Man's free Will, without any Sort of Di&s;po&s;al, or Order|ing in the Ca&s;e, whence it &s;hould be previou&s;ly certain how that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ree Will &s;hould determine, then &s;till that fir&s;t Determination of the Will, mu&s;t be meerly Contingent or by Chance. It could not have any antecedent Act of the Will to determine it; for I &s;peak now of the very fir&s;t Act or Motion of the Will, re&s;pecting the Affair that may be looked upon as the prime Ground, and highe&s;t Source of the Event. To &s;uppo&s;e this to be determined by a foregoing Act is a Contradiction.

If God has not Liberty in this Matter to determine either of the&s;e two, as he plea&s;es, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e determin|ing that the fir&s;t Father of Men &s;hould repre&s;ent the Re&s;t, and not that every one &s;hould &s;tand for him&s;elf, is injurious to Mankind. For if it be not injurious to Man|kind, how is it unju&s;t?

And if there be nothing in the Nature of the Thing, that makes the former better for Mankind than the latter, then it will follow, that Mankind are not hurt in God's choo&s;ing and appointing the latter, rather than the former; or which is the &s;ame Thing, that it is not injurious to Mankind.</P>
<P N="3">3 When Men are fallen, and become &s;inful, God by his Sovereignty has a Right to determine about their Redemption as he plea&s;es.

God has tried you with a great Deal of Kind|ne&s;s, and he never has &s;incerely been thanked by you for any of it.

It may be you have received many remarkable Mercies, Recoveries from Sickne&s;s, or Pre&s;ervations of your Life, when at one Time and another expo&s;ed by Accidents, when if you had died, you would have gone directly to Hell: But you never had any true Thankfulne&s;s for any of the&s;e Mercies.

But what Thanks has God received for it? What Kind of Returns have you made for all this Kindne&s;s? As God has multiplied Mercies, &s;o have you multiplied Provocations.</P>

Government, yet it has been in you; you have not been quiet in the Frame of your Mind; you have had the Heart of a Viper within, and have been ready to &s;pit Venom at God: And 'tis well if &s;ometimes you have not actually done it, by tolerating bla&s;phemous Thoughts, and malignant Ri&s;ings of Heart again&s;t him; yea, and the Frame of your Heart in &s;ome Mea&s;ure ap|peared, in an impatient and fretful Behaviour.</P>

Here therefore I would endeavour to convince you that you are under a gro&s;s Mi&s;take in this Matter. And 1. I would endeavour to &s;hew the Weakne&s;s of the <HI>Grounds</HI> of your Mi&s;take. And, 2. To demon&s;trate to you, that you have rejected, and do wilfully reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>1. That you may &s;ee the Weakne&s;s of the Grounds of your Mi&s;take, con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a great Deal of Difference between a Willingne&s;s not to be damned, and a being willing to receive Chri&s;t for your Saviour. You have the former; there is no doubt to be made of that; no Body &s;uppo&s;es that you love Mi&s;ery &s;o well, as to chu&s;e an Eternity of it: And &s;o doubtle&s;s you are willing to be &s;aved from eternal Mi&s;ery. But that is a very different Thing from being willing to come to Chri&s;t: Per&s;ons very com|monly mi&s;take the one for the other, but they are quite two Things: You may love the Deliverance, but hate the Deliverer. You tell of a <HI>Willingne&s;s;</HI> but con&s;ider what is the Object of that Willingne&s;s: It don't re&s;|pect Chri&s;t; the Way of Salvation by him is not at all the Object of it; but 'tis wholly terminated on your E&s;cape from Mi&s;ery: The Inclination of your Will goes no further than <HI>&s;elf,</HI> it never reaches Chri&s;t. You are willing not to be mi&s;erable; that is you love your &s;elf; and there your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Choice terminates: And 'tis but a vain Pretence, and Delu&s;ion, to &s;ay or think that you are willing to accept of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is certainly a great Deal of Difference be|tween a forced Compliance, and a free Willingne&s;s. Force and Freedom can't con&s;i&s;t together. Now that Willingne&s;s that you tell of, whereby you think you are willing to have Chri&s;t for a Saviour, is meerly a forced Thing. Your Heart does not go out after Chri&s;t of it &s;elf; but you are forced and driven to &s;eek an In|tere&s;t in him Chri&s;t has no Share at all in your Heart; there is no Manner of clo&s;ing of the Heart with him. This forced Compliance is not what Chri&s;t &s;eeks of you; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eeks a free and willing Acceptance, P&s;alm 110. 3.

<HI>Thy People &s;hall be willing in the Day of thy Power.</HI> He &s;eeks not that you &s;hould receive him again&s;t your Will, but with a free Will: He &s;eeks Entertainment in your Heart and Choice.&mdash; And,</P>
<P>If you refu&s;e thus to receive Chri&s;t, how ju&s;t is it that Chri&s;t &s;hould refu&s;e to receive you! How rea&s;onable are Chri&s;t's Terms, who offers to &s;ave all tho&s;e that wil|lingly, or with a good Will, accept of him for their Savi|our! Who can rationally expect that Chri&s;t &s;hould force him&s;elf upon any Man, to be his Saviour? Or what can be looked for more rea&s;onable, than that all that would be &s;aved by Chri&s;t, &s;hould heartily and free|ly entertain him? And &s;urely it would be very di&s;ho|nourable for Chri&s;t to offer him&s;elf upon lower Terms.</P>
<P>But I would now proceed,</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;hew that 'tis really &s;o that you are not willing to have Chri&s;t for a Saviour. To convince you of it, con&s;ider,</P>
<P>1. How it is po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould be willing to accept of Chri&s;t as a Saviour from the De&s;ert of a Puni&s;h|ment, that you are not &s;en&s;ible you have de&s;erved. If you are truly willing to accept of Chri&s;t as a Saviour, it mu&s;t be as a Sacrifice to make Atonement for your Guilt: Chri&s;t came into the World on this Errand, to offer him&s;elf as an Atonement, to an&s;wer for our De&s;ert of Puni&s;hment. But how is it po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould be willing to accept of Chri&s;t, as an Atone|ment for that Guilt that you be not &s;en&s;ible that you have? How can you be willing to have Chri&s;t for a Saviour from a De&s;ert of Hell, if you be not &s;en&s;i|ble that you have a De&s;ert of Hell? If you have not really de&s;erved everla&s;ting Burnings in Hell, then the very Offer of an Atonement for &s;uch a De&s;ert is an Im|po&s;ition upon you. If you have no &s;uch Guilt upon you, then the very Offer of a Satisfaction for that Guilt is an Injury, becau&s;e it implies in it a Charge of Guilt that you are free from. Now therefore 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that a Man that is not convinced of his Guilt, can be willing to accept of an Offer; becau&s;e he can't be will|ing to accept the Charge that the Offer implies: that
<PB N="224" REF="004239_0231_10042E28DD537A10">
he looks upon as injurious. A Man that is not convinced that he has de&s;erved &s;o dreadful a Puni&s;hment, can't willingly &s;ubmit to be charged with it; if he thinks he is willing, it is but a meer forced, feigned Bu&s;ine&s;s; be|cau&s;e in his Heart he looks upon him&s;elf greatly injured: And therefore he can't freely accept of Chri&s;t, under that Notion, of a Saviour from that Guilt, and from the De&s;ert of &s;uch a Puni&s;hment; for &s;uch an Acceptance is an implicit owning that he does de&s;erve &s;uch a Pu|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I don't &s;ay, but that Men may be willing to be &s;aved from an unde&s;erved Puni&s;hment; they may rather not &s;uffer it than &s;uffer it: But a Man can't be willing to ac|cept one at God's Hands, under the Notion of a Saviour from a Puni&s;hment de&s;erved from him, that he thinks he has not de&s;erved; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould freely allow a Saviour under that Notion. Such an one can't like the Way of Salvation by Chri&s;t; for if he thinks he has not de&s;erved Hell, then he will think that Freedom from Hell is a Debt; and therefore can't willingly and heartily receive it as a free Gift.&mdash;If a King &s;hould condemn a Man to &s;ome exceeding torment|ing Death, which the condemned Per&s;on thought him|&s;elf not de&s;erving off, but looked upon the Sentence un|ju&s;t and cruel, and the King, when the Time of Execu|tion drew nigh, &s;hould offer him his Pardon, under the Notion of a very great Act of Grace and Clemency, the condemned Per&s;on never could willingly and hear|tily allow it under that Notion, becau&s;e he judged him&s;elf unju&s;tly condemned.</P>
<P>Now by this it is evident that you are not willing to accept of Chri&s;t as your Saviour; becau&s;e you never yet had &s;uch a Sen&s;e of your own Sinfulne&s;s, and &s;uch a Conviction of your great Guilt in God's Sight, as to be indeed convinced that you lay ju&s;tly condemned to the Puni&s;hment of Hell. You never was convinced that you had forfeited all Favour, and was in God's Hands, and at his &s;overeign and arbitrary Di&s;po&s;al, to be either de&s;troyed or &s;aved, ju&s;t as he plea&s;ed. You never yet was convinced of the Sovereignty of God. Hence are
<PB N="225" REF="004239_0232_10042E2F930FB708">
there &s;o many Objections ari&s;ing again&s;t the Ju&s;tice of your Puni&s;hment, from original Sin, and from God's De|crees, from Mercy &s;hown to others, and the like.</P>
<P N="2">2. That you be not &s;incerely willing to accept of Chri&s;t as your Saviour, appears by this, That you never have been convinced that he is &s;ufficient for the Work; of your Salvation. You never had a Sight or Sen&s;e of any &s;uch Excellency or Worthine&s;s in Chri&s;t, as &s;hould give &s;uch great Value to his Blood and his Mediation with God, as that it was &s;ufficient to be accepted for &s;uch exceeding guilty Creatures, &amp; tho&s;e that have &s;o provoked God, and expo&s;ed them&s;elves to &s;uch amazing Wrath. A &s;aying it is &s;o, and a cu&s;tomary yielding &amp; allowing it to be as others &s;ay, is a very different Thing from being really convinced of it, and a being made &s;en&s;ible of it in your own Heart. The Sufficiency of Chri&s;t depends upon, or rather con&s;i&s;ts in his Excellency. It is becau&s;e he is &s;o excellent a Per&s;on, that his Blood is of &s;ufficient Va|lue to atone for Sin, and 'tis hence that his Obedience is &s;o worthy in God's Sight; 'tis al&s;o hence that his In|terce&s;&s;ion is &s;o prevalent; and therefore tho&s;e that never had any &s;piritual Sight or Sen&s;e of Chri&s;t's Excellency, can't be &s;en&s;ible of his Sufficiency.</P>
<P>And that Sinners be not convinced that Chri&s;t is &s;uffi|cient for the Work he has undertaken, appears mo&s;t manife&s;tly when they are under great Convictions of their Sin, and Danger of God's Wrath. Though it may be before they thought they could allow Chri&s;t to be &s;uffi|cient, (for it is ea&s;y to allow any one to be &s;ufficient for our Defence, at a Time when we &s;ee no Danger,) yet when they come to be &s;en&s;ible of their Guilt, and God's Wrath, what di&s;couraging Thoughts do they entertain! How are they ready to draw towards De&s;pair, as if there no Hope or Help for &s;uch wicked Creatures as they! The Rea&s;on is, They have no Apprehen&s;ion or Sen&s;e of any other Way that God's Maje&s;ty can be vindicated&punc; but only in their Mi&s;ery: To tell them of the Blood of Chri&s;t, &s;ignifies nothing, it don't relieve their &s;inking de&s;pairing Hearts. This makes it mo&s;t evident that
<PB N="226" REF="004239_0233_10042E0428A63448">
they are not convinced that Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient to be their Mediator.</P>
<P>And as long as they are unconvinced of this, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be willing to accept of him as <HI>their Mediator</HI> and Saviour. A Man in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Fear won't willingly betake him&s;elf to a Fort that he judges not &s;ufficient to defend him from the Enemy: A Man won't willingly venture out into the Ocean, in a Ship that he &s;u&s;pects is leaky, and will &s;ink before he gets through his Voyage.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis evident that you are not willing to have Chri&s;t &s;on your Saviour, becau&s;e you have &s;o mean an Opinion of him, that you dur&s;t not tru&s;t his Faithful|ne&s;s. One that undertakes to be the Saviour of Souls had need be faithful; for if he fails in &s;uch a Tru&s;t, how great is the Lo&s;s! But you are not convinced of Chri&s;t's Faithfulne&s;s; as is evident, becau&s;e at &s;uch Times as when you are in a con&s;iderable Mea&s;ure &s;en&s;ible of your Guilt and God's Anger, you can't be convinced that Chri&s;t is willing to accept of you, or that he &s;tands ready to receive you if you &s;hould come to him, though Chri&s;t &s;o much invites you to come to him, and has &s;o fully declared that he won't reject you, if you do come; as particularly, John 6&punc; 37. <HI>He that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t cut.</HI> Now, there is no Man can be hearti|ly willing to tru&s;t his eternal Welfare in the Hands of an unfaithful Per&s;on, or one who&s;e Faithfulne&s;s he &s;u&s;pects.</P>
<P N="4">4. You are not willing to be &s;aved in that Way by Chri&s;t, as is evident, becau&s;e you are not willing that your own Goodne&s;s &s;hould be &s;et at nought. In the Way of Salvation by Chri&s;t Men's own Goodne&s;s is wholly &s;et at nought, there is no Account at all made of it. Now you can't be willing to be &s;aved in a Way wherein your own Goodne&s;s is &s;et at nought, as is evi|dent by that, that you make much of it your &s;elf. You make much of your Prayers and Pains in Religion, and are often thinking of them; how con&s;iderable&punc; do they appear to you, when you look back upon them! And how much are &s;ome of you in thinking how much more
<PB N="227" REF="004239_0234_10042DFC0A7ABD40">
you have done than &s;ome others, and in expecting &s;ome Re&s;pect or Regard that God &s;hould manife&s;t to what you do? Now, if you make &s;o much of what you do your &s;elf, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould be freely wil|ling that God &s;hould make nothing of it. As we may &s;ee in other Things; if a Man is proud of a great E&s;|tate, or if he values him&s;elf much upon his honourable Office, or his great Abilities, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould like it, and heartily approve of it, that others &s;hould make light of the&s;e Things, and de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that 'tis &s;o evident that you refu&s;e to accept of Chri&s;t as your Saviour, Why is Chri&s;t to be blamed that he don't &s;ave you? Chri&s;t has offered him&s;elf to you to be your Saviour in Time pa&s;t, and he continues offering him&s;elf &s;till, and you continue to re|ject him, and yet complain that he don't &s;ave you.&mdash;So &s;trangely unrea&s;onable, and incon&s;i&s;tent with them|&s;elves, are Go&s;pel Sinners!</P>
<P>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">xpect that there are many of you, that in your Hearts &s;till object; your Mouths be not &s;topp'd.&mdash;Such an Objection as this, is probably now in the Hearts of many here pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> If it be &s;o, that I am not willing to have Chri&s;t for my Saviour, yet I can't make my &s;elf willing.</P>
<P>But I would give an An&s;wer to this Objection, by laying down two Things, that mu&s;t be acknowleged to be exceeding evident.</P>
<P N="1">1 'Tis no Excu&s;e that you can't receive Chri&s;t of your &s;elf, unle&s;s you would if you could. This is &s;o evident of it &s;elf, that it &s;carce needs any Proof. Certainly if Per&s;ons would not if they could, it is ju&s;t the &s;ame Thing as to the Blame that lies upon them, whether they can or cannot. If you were willing, and then found that you could not, your being unable would alter the Ca&s;e, and might be &s;ome Excu&s;e; becau&s;e then the Defect would not be in your Will, but only in your Ability: But as long as you will not, it is no Matter what the Ability is, whether you have Ability or no Ability.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="004239_0235_100404F917213BF0">
If you be not willing to accept of Chri&s;t, it will fol|low that you have no &s;incere <HI>Willingne&s;s to be willing;</HI> becau&s;e the Will always nece&s;&s;arily approves <HI>of,</HI> and re&s;ts <HI>in</HI> its own Acts. To &s;uppo&s;e the Contrary would be to &s;uppo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Contradiction; it would be to &s;uppo&s;e that a Man's Will is contrary to it &s;elf, or that he wills contrary to what he him&s;elf wills. So that as you are not willing to come to Chri&s;t, and can't make your &s;elf willing, &s;o you have no &s;incere De&s;ire to be willing; and therefore may mo&s;t ju&s;tly peri&s;h without a Saviour. There is no Excu&s;e at all for you; for &s;ay what you will about your Inability, the Seat of your Blame lies in your perver&s;e Will, that is an Enemy to the Saviour. 'Tis in vain for you to tell of your Want of Power, as long as your Will is found defective. If a Man &s;hould hate you, and devour you, and exalt him&s;elf, and &s;mite you in the Face, and tell you that he did it volunta|rily, and becau&s;e he had a Mind to, but only &s;hould tell you at the &s;ame Time, that he hated you &s;o much that he could not help chu&s;ing and willing &s;o to do, would you take it the more patiently for that? Would not your Indignation be rather &s;tirr'd up the more?</P>
<P N="2">2. If you would be willing if you could, that is no Excu&s;e, unle&s;s your Willingne&s;s to be willing be &s;incere. That which is hypocritical, and don't come from the Heart, but is meerly forced, ought wholly to be &s;et a|&s;ide, as worthy of no Con&s;ideration, and that becau&s;e common Sen&s;e teaches that that which is not hearty but hypocritical is indeed nothing, being only a Shew of what is not; but that which is good for nothing, ought to go for nothing. But if you &s;et a&s;ide all that is not free, &amp; call nothing a Willingne&s;s but a free hearty Willingne&s;s, then &s;ee how the Ca&s;e &s;tands, &amp; whether or no you have not lo&s;t all your Excu&s;e for &s;tanding out again&s;t the Calls of the Go&s;pel You &s;ay you would make your &s;elf willing to accept if you could; but 'tis not from any good Princi|ple that you are willing for that; 'tis not from any free Inclination, or true Re&s;pect to Chri&s;t, or any Love to your Duty, or any Spirit of Obedience, or from the influence of any Manner of real Re&s;pect, or Tendency
<PB N="229" REF="004239_0236_10040B5040347998">
in your Heart, towards any Thing that is good, or from any other Principle than &s;uch as is in the Hearts of De|vils, and would make them have the &s;ame Sort of Wil|lingne&s;s in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances. It is therefore evident that there can be no Goodne&s;s in that <HI>woulding to be willing</HI> to come to Chri&s;t: And that which has no <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> can't be an Excu&s;e for any <HI>Badne&s;s.</HI> If there be no <HI>good</HI> in it, then it &s;ignifies nothing &amp; weighs nothing, when put into the Scales to counterbalance that which is <HI>bad.</HI></P>
<P>Sinners therefore &s;pend their Time in fooli&s;h arguing and objecting, making much of that which is good for nothing, making tho&s;e Excu&s;es that be not worth offer|ing.&mdash;'Tis in vain to keep making Objections: You &s;tand ju&s;tly condemned: The Blame lies all at your Door: Thru&s;t it off from you as often as you will, it will return upon you: Sew Fig leaves as long as you will, your Nakedne&s;s will appear: You continue wil|fully and wickedly rejecting Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and won't have him for your Saviour, and therefore 'tis &s;otti&s;h Mad|ne&s;s in you to charge Chri&s;t with Inju&s;tice that he don't &s;ave you.</P>
<P>Here is the Sin of Unbelief! Thus the Guilt of that great Sin lies upon you! If you never had thus treated a Saviour, you might mo&s;t ju&s;tly have been damned to all Eternity: It would but be exactly agreable to your Treatment of God. But be&s;ides this, when God not|with&s;tanding, has offered you his own dear Son to &s;ave you from this endle&s;s Mi&s;ery you had de&s;erved, and not only &s;o, but to make you happy eternally in the Enjoy|ment of him&s;elf, you refu&s;ed him, and would not have him for your Saviour, and &s;till refu&s;e to comply with the Offers of the Go&s;pel; what can render any Per&s;on more inexcu&s;eable?

<PB N="230" REF="004239_0237_100409B345284060">
in <HI>Damnation</HI> appears abundantly the more clear and bright, after a wilful Rejection of offered <HI>Salvation.</HI> What can an offended Prince do more than freely offer Pardon to a condemned Male factor? And if he refu&s;es to accept of it, will any one &s;ay that his Execution is unju&s;t?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God's Ju&s;tice</HI> will appear <HI>in your greater De&s;truc|tion.</HI> Be&s;ides the Guilt that you would have had if a Saviour never had been offered, you bring that great additional Guilt upon you, of mo&s;t ungratefully refu&s;ing offered Deliverance. What more ba&s;e and vile Treat|ment of God can there be, than for you, when ju&s;tly con|demned to eternal Mi&s;ery, and ready to be executed, &amp; God graciou&s;ly &s;ends his own Son, who comes &amp; knocks at your Door with a Pardon in his Hand, and not only a Pardon, but a Deed of eternal Glory; I &s;ay, what can be wor&s;e, then for you out of Di&s;like, and Enmity again&s;t God, and his Son, to refu&s;e to accept tho&s;e Benefits at his Hands! How ju&s;tly may the Anger of God be greatly incen&s;ed and increa&s;ed by it! When a Sinner thus un|gratefully rejects Mercy, his la&s;t Error is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t; this is more heinous than all his former Re|bellion, and may ju&s;tly bring down more fearful Wrath upon him.</P>
<P>The Heinou&s;ne&s;s of this Sin of rejecting a Saviour e&s;pecially appears in two Things,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Greatne&s;s of the Benefits offered; which ap|pears in the Greatne&s;s of the Deliverance, which is from inexpre&s;&s;ible Degrees of <HI>Corruption</HI> and <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> of Heart and Life, the lea&s;t Degree of which is infinitely Evil; and from Mi&s;ery that is everla&s;ting; and in the Greatne&s;s and Glory of the Inheritance purcha&s;ed and offered, Heb. 2. 3. <HI>How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great Salvation?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Wonderfulne&s;s of the Way in which the&s;e Benefits are procured and offered. That God &s;hould lay Help on his own Son, when our Ca&s;e was &s;o deplo|rable that Help could be had in no meer Creature; and that He &s;hould undertake for us, and &s;hould come into the World, and take upon him our Nature, and &s;hould
<PB N="231" REF="004239_0238_1004054C17F3F540">
not only appear in a low State of Life, but &s;hould die &s;uch a Death, and endure &s;uch Torments and Contempt for Sinners while Enemies, How wonderful is it! And what Tongue or Pen can &s;et forth the Greatne&s;s of the Ingratitude, Ba&s;ene&s;s and Perver&s;ene&s;s that there is in it, when a peri&s;hing Sinner that is in the mo&s;t extreme Nece&s;&s;ity of Salvation, rejects it, after it is procured in &s;uch a Way as this! That &s;o glorious a Per&s;on &s;hould be thus treated, and that when he comes on &s;o gracious an Errand! That he &s;hould &s;tand &s;o long offering him|&s;elf, and calling and inviting, as he has done to many of you, and all to no Purpo&s;e, but all the while be &s;et at nought!&mdash;Surely you might ju&s;tly be ca&s;t into Hell without one more Offer of a Saviour! Yea, and thru&s;t down into the lowe&s;t Hell! Herein you have exceeded the very Devils; for they never rejected the Offers of &s;uch glorious Mercy; no, nor of any Mercy at all. This will be the di&s;tingui&s;hing Condemnation of Go&s;pel Sin|ners, John 3. 18. <HI>He that hath not believed is condemned already, becau&s;e he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</HI></P>
<P>That outward Smoothne&s;s of your Carriage towards Chri&s;t, that Appearance of Re&s;pect to Him in your Looks, your Speeches, and Ge&s;tures, don't argue but that you &s;et him at nought in your Heart. There may be much of the&s;e outward Shews of Re&s;pect, and yet you be like <HI>Judas</HI> that betrayed the Son of Man with a ki&s;s; and like tho&s;e Mockers that bowed the Knee be|fore him, and at the &s;ame Time &s;pit in his Face.</P>
<P>III. If God &s;hould for ever ca&s;t you off and de&s;troy you, it would be <HI>agreable to your Treatment of others:</HI> It would be no other than what would be exactly an&s;|werable to your Behaviour towards your Fellow Crea|tures, that have the &s;ame humane <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and are natu|rally in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame Circum&s;tances with you, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t you ought to love as your &s;elf. And that appears e&s;pecially in two Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. You have many of you been <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> in your Spi|rit <HI>to the Salvation of others.</HI> There are &s;everal Ways
<PB N="232" REF="004239_0239_100404FB929971B0">
that natural Men manife&s;t a Spirit of Oppo&s;ition again&s;t the Salvation of others Souls It &s;ometimes appears by a Fear that their Companions, Acquaintance, and Equals will obtain Mercy, and &s;o become un&s;peakably happier than they. It is &s;ometimes manife&s;ted by an Unea&s;ine&s;s at the News of others having hopefully obtained. It appears when Per&s;ons envy others for it, and di&s;like them the more, and di&s;reli&s;h their Talk, and avoid their Company, and can't bear to hear their religious Di&s;|cour&s;e, and e&s;pecially to receive Warnings and Coun&s;els from them. And it oftentimes appears by their Back|wardne&s;s to entertain charitable Thoughts of them, and their being difficultly brought to believe that it is real|ly &s;o, that they have obtained Mercy, and a Forwardne&s;s to li&s;ten to any Thing that &s;eems to contradict it. The Devil hated to own <HI>Job'</HI>s Sincerity, <HI>Job 1. 7, &amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. <HI>Ver&s;es</HI> 3, 4, 5. There appears very often much of this Spirit of the Devil in natural Men. Sometimes they are ready to make a Ridicule of others pretended Godline&s;s: They &s;peak of the Ground of others Hopes, as the Enemies of the <HI>Jews</HI> did of the Wall that they built. Neh. 4. 3 <HI>Now</HI> Tobiah <HI>the</HI> Ammonite <HI>was by him, and he &s;aid, that which they build, if a Fox go up, he &s;hall even break down their Stone Wall.</HI> There are many that join with <HI>Sanballat</HI> and <HI>Tobiah,</HI> and are of the &s;ame Spirit with them. There always was, and al|ways will be, an Enmity betwixt the Seed of the Ser|pent, and the Seed of the Woman. It appeared in <HI>Cain</HI> who hated his Brother, becau&s;e he was more acceptable to God than him&s;elf; and it appears &s;till in the&s;e Times, and in this Place. There are many that are like the elder Brother, who could not bear it that the Prodigal when he returned &s;hould be received with &s;uch Joy and good Entertainment, and was put into a Fret by it, both again&s;t his Brother that had returned, and his Father that made him &s;o welcome. <HI>Luke</HI> 15.</P>
<P>Thus have many of you been oppo&s;ite to the Salva|tion of others, that &s;tand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Nece&s;&s;ity of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> You have been again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> being delivered from everla&s;ting Mi&s;ery, that can bear it no better than you;

not becau&s;e their Salvation would do you any Hurt, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Damnation help you, any otherwi&s;e than as it would gratify that vile Spirit that is &s;o much like the Spirit of the Devil, who, becau&s;e he is mi&s;erable him&s;elf, is unwilling that others &s;hould be happy. How ju&s;t therefore is it that God &s;hould be oppo&s;ite to your Sal|vation! If you have &s;o little Love or Mercy in you, as to begrutch your Neighbours Salvation, whom you have no cau&s;e to hate, but the Law of God and Nature requires you to love, why is God bound to exerci&s;e &s;uch infinite Love and Mercy to you, as to &s;ave you at the Price of his own Blood, that he is no Way bound to love, but that have de&s;erved his Hatred a thou&s;and &amp; a thou&s;and Times? You are not willing that others &s;hould be converted, that have behaved them&s;elves injuriou&s;ly towards you; and yet will you count it hard if God don't be&s;tow converting Grace upon you, that have de|&s;erved ten thou&s;and Times as ill of God, as ever any of your Neighbours have of you? You are oppo&s;ite to God's &s;hewing Mercy to the&s;e and tho&s;e, that you think have been vicious Per&s;ons, and are very unworthy of &s;uch Mercy.&mdash;Is others Unworthine&s;s a ju&s;t Rea&s;on why God &s;hould not be&s;tow Mercy on them? And yet will God be hard, if notwith&s;tanding all your Unworthine&s;s, &amp; the Abo|minablene&s;s of your Spirit &amp; Practice in his Sight, he don't &s;how <HI>you</HI> Mercy? You would have God be&s;tow liberal|ly on you, and upbraid not; but yet when he &s;hews Mercy to others, you are ready to upbraid, as &s;oon as you hear of it; you immediately are thinking with your &s;elf how ill they have behaved them&s;elves; and it may be your Mouths on this Occa&s;ion are open, enu|merating and aggravating the Sins they have been guil|ty of.&mdash;You would have God bury all your Faults, and wholly blot out all your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; but yet if he be&s;tows Mercy on others, it may be you will take that Occa&s;ion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ake up all their old Faults that you can think of.&mdash;You don't much reflect on &amp; condemn your &s;elf, for your Ba&s;ene&s;s &amp; unju&s;t Spirit towards others, in your Oppo&s;i|tion to their Salvation; you don't quarrel with your&s;elf, and condemn your &s;elf for this; but yet you in your Heart
<PB N="234" REF="004239_0241_10042E3A9045FC30">
will quarrel with God, and condemn him, and fret at his Di&s;pen&s;ations, becau&s;e you think he &s;eems oppo&s;ite to &s;hewing Mercy to you.&mdash;One would think that the Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Things &s;hould for ever &s;top your Mouth.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider how you have <HI>promoted others Damnation.</HI> Many of you by the bad Examples you have &s;et, by cor|rupting the Minds of others, by your &s;inful Conver&s;ation, by leading them into Sin, or &s;trengthening them in Sin, and by the Mi&s;chief that you have done in humane So|ciety other Ways that might be mentioned, have been guilty of tho&s;e Things that have tended to others Dam|nation. You have heretofore appeared on the Side of Sin and Satan, and have behaved your &s;elf &s;o as much to &s;trengthen their Intere&s;t, &amp; have been many Ways ac|ce&s;&s;ary to others Sins, have harden'd others Hearts, and thereby have done what has tended to the Ruin of their Souls.</P>
<P>And without Doubt there are tho&s;e here pre&s;ent, that have been in a great Mea&s;ure the Means of others Dam|nation. Though it is true that it is determined of God who he will &s;ave, and who not, from all Eternity, yet one Man may really be a Means of others Damnation, as well as Salvation. Chri&s;t charges the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> with this, Matth. 23. 13. <HI>Ye &s;hut up the King|dom of Heaven again&s;t Men; for ye neither go in your &s;elves, neither &s;uffer ye them that are entring to go in.</HI> We have no Rea&s;on to think that this Congregation has none in it, that are cur&s;ed from Day to Day, by poor Souls that are roaring out in Hell, who&s;e Damnation they have been a Means of, or have greatly contribu|ted to.</P>
<P>There are many that contribute to their own Chil|drens Damnation, by neglecting their Education and &s;etting them bad Examples, and bringing them up in &s;inful Ways: They take &s;ome Care of their Bodies, but take but little Care of their poor Souls; they provide for them Bread to eat, but deny them the Bread of Life that their fami&s;hing Souls &s;tand in Need of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> And are there no &s;uch Parents here that have thus treated their

Children? If their Children be not gone to Hell, 'tis no thank to them; 'tis not becau&s;e they have not done what has tended to their De&s;truction.&mdash;Seeing there|fore you have had no more Regard to others Salvation, and have promoted their Damnation, how ju&s;tly might God leave you to peri&s;h your &s;elf?</P>
<P>IV. If God &s;hould eternally ca&s;t you off, it would but be <HI>agreable to your own Behaviour towards your &s;elf:</HI> And that in two Re&s;pects;</P>
<P N="1">1. In being &s;o <HI>Carele&s;s of your own Salvation.</HI> You have refu&s;ed to take Care for your Salvation, as God has <HI>coun&s;ell'd</HI> and <HI>commanded you,</HI> from Time to Time; and why may not God neglect it, now you <HI>&s;eek it of him?</HI> Is God obliged to be more careful of your Hap|pine&s;s, than you are, either of your own Happine&s;s, or his Glory? Is God bound to take that Care for you, out of Love to you, that you won't take for your &s;elf, either from Love to your &s;elf, or Regard to his Autho|rity? How long, and how greatly, have you neglected the Welfare of your precious Soul, refu&s;ing to take Pains and deny your &s;elf, or put your &s;elf a little out of your Way for your Salvation, while God has been calling upon you! Neither your Duty to God, nor Love to your own Soul, were enough to induce you to do little Things for your own eternal Welfare; and yet do you now expect that God &s;hould do great Things, putting forth almighty Power, &amp; exerci&s;ing infinite Mercy for it? You was urged to take care for your Salvation, and not to put it off: You was told that that was the be&s;t Time, before you grew older, and that it might be, if you would put it off, God would not hear you afterwards; but yet you would not hearken; you would run the Venture of it. Now how ju&s;tly might God or|der it &s;o, that it &s;hould be too late, leaving you to &s;eek in Vain! You was told that you would repent of it, if you delayed; but you would not hear: How ju&s;tly therefore may God give you Cau&s;e to repent of it, by refu&s;ing to &s;how you Mercy now! If God &s;ees you go|ing on in Ways contrary to his Commands, and his Glory,
<PB N="236" REF="004239_0243_10042E45A505F760">
and requires you to for&s;ake them, and tells you that they are Ways that tend to the De&s;truction of your own Soul, and therefore Coun&s;els you to avoid them, and you refu&s;e, how ju&s;t would it be if God &s;hould be provoked by it, henceforward to be as carele&s;s of the Good of your Soul as you are your &s;elf!</P>
<P N="2">2. You have not only neglected your Salvation, but you <HI>have wilfully taken direct Cour&s;es to undo your &s;elf.</HI> You have gone on in tho&s;e Ways and Practices that have directly tended to your Damnation, and have been perver&s;e and ob&s;tinate in it.&mdash;You can't plead Igno|rance; you had all the Light &s;et before you that you could de&s;ire; God told you that you was <HI>undoing</HI> your &s;elf; but yet you would do it: He told you that the Path you was going in led to De&s;truction, and coun&s;el'd you to avoid it; but you would not hearken: How ju&s;t|ly therefore may God leave you to be <HI>undone!</HI> You have ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted to travel in the Way that leads to Hell for a long Time, contrary to God's con|tinual Coun&s;els and Commands, till it may be at length you are got almo&s;t to your Journey's End, and are come near to Hell's Gate, and &s;o begin to be &s;en&s;ible of your Danger and Mi&s;ery; and now account it unju&s;t and hard, if God won't deliver you! You have de&s;troy|ed your &s;elf, and de&s;troyed your &s;elf <HI>wilfully,</HI> contrary to God's repeated Coun&s;els, yea, and de&s;troyed your &s;elf <HI>in fighting again&s;t God:</HI> Now therefore why do you Blame any but your &s;elf, if you are de&s;troyed? If you will undo your &s;elf in oppo&s;ing God, and while God oppo&s;es you by his Calls and Coun&s;els, and, it may be too, by the Convictions of his Spirit, what can you object again&s;t it, if God now leaves you to be undone? You would have your own Way, and did not like that God &s;hould oppo&s;e you in it, and your Way was to ruin your own Soul: How ju&s;t therefore is it, if now at length, God cea&s;es to oppo&s;e you, and falls in with you, and lets your Soul be ruin'd, and as you would de&s;troy your &s;elf, &s;o &s;hould put to his Hand to de&s;troy you too! The Ways you went on in had a natural Tendency to your Mi&s;ery: If you would drink Poi&s;on, in Oppo&s;i|tion
<PB N="237" REF="004239_0244_1004050420424148">
to God, and in Contempt of him and his Advice, who can you Blame but your &s;elf if you are poi&s;on'd, and &s;o peri&s;h? If you would run into the Fire again&s;t all Re&s;traints both of God's Mercy and Authority, you mu&s;t e'en blame your &s;elf if you are burnt.</P>
<P>Thus I have propo&s;ed &s;ome Things to your Con&s;ide|ration, which if you are not exceeding blind, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and perver&s;e, will &s;top your Mouth, and convince you that you &s;tand ju&s;tly condemned before God, and that he would in no wi&s;e deal hardly with you, but altoge|ther ju&s;tly, in denying you any Mercy, and in refu&s;ing to hear your Prayers, let you pray never &s;o earne&s;tly, and never &s;o often, and continue in it never &s;o long; and that God may utterly di&s;regard your Tea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Moans, your heavy Heart, your earne&s;t De&s;ires, and great En|deavours, and that he may ca&s;t you into eternal De&s;truc|tion, without any Regard to your Welfare, denying you converting Grace, and giving you over to Satan, and at la&s;t ca&s;t you into the Lake that burns with Fire and Brim&s;tone, to be there to Eternity, having no Re&s;t Day nor Night, for ever glorifying his Ju&s;tice upon you, in the Pre&s;ence of the holy Angels, and the Pre&s;ence of the Lamb.</P>
<P><HI>Object</HI> But here many may &s;till object, (for I am &s;en&s;ible 'tis an hard Thing to &s;top Sinners Mouths,) <Q>God &s;hews Mercy to others that have done the&s;e Things as well as I, yea, that have done a great Deal wor&s;e than I.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. That does not prove that God is any Way bound to &s;hew Mercy to you, or them either. If God does be&s;tow it on others, he don't be&s;tow it <HI>on them</HI> becau&s;e he is bound to be&s;tow it: He might if he had plea&s;ed, with glorious Ju&s;tice have denied it them. If God be&s;tows it <HI>on &s;ome,</HI> that does not prove that he is bound to be&s;tow it <HI>on any;</HI> and if he is bound to be&s;tow it on <HI>none,</HI> then he is not bound to be&s;tow it on <HI>you.</HI> God is in Debt to none, and if he gives to &s;ome that he is not in Debt to, becau&s;e 'tis his Plea&s;ure, that don't bring him into Debt to others.&mdash;It alters not the Ca&s;e as to you, at all, whether others have it or have it
<PB N="238" REF="004239_0245_10042E4CC5369070">
not: You don't de&s;erve Damnation the le&s;s, than if Mercy never had been be&s;towed on any at all. Matth. 20 15. <HI>Is thine Eye evil, becau&s;e mine is good?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. If this Objection be good, then the Exerci&s;e of God's Mercy is not in his own Right, and his Grace is not his own to give. That which God may not di&s;po&s;e of as he plea&s;es, is not his own; for that which is ones own, is at his own Di&s;po&s;al: but if it be not God's own, then he is not capable of making a Gift or Pre&s;ent of it to any one; it is impo&s;&s;ible to give a Debt.</P>
<P>What is it that you would make of God? Mu&s;t the great God be tied up to that, that he mu&s;t not u&s;e his own Plea&s;ure in be&s;towing his own Gifts, but if he be|&s;tows them on one, mu&s;t be looked upon obliged to be&s;tow them on another? Is not God worthy to have the &s;ame Right, with Re&s;pect to the Gifts of his Grace, that a Man has to his Money or Goods? Is it becau&s;e God is not &s;o great, and &s;hould be more in Sub|jection than Man, that this can't be allowed him? If any of you &s;ee Cau&s;e to &s;hew Kindne&s;s to a Neighbour, do all the Re&s;t of your Neighbours come to you, and tell you that you owe them &s;o much as you have given to &s;uch a Man? But this is the Way that you deal with God! as though God were not worthy to have as ab&s;o|lute a Property in his Goods, as you have in your's!</P>
<P>At this Rate God can't make a Pre&s;ent of any Thing; he has nothing of his own to be&s;tow; if he has a Mind to &s;hew peculiar Favour to &s;ome, or to lay &s;ome parti|cular Per&s;ons under peculiar Obligations to him, he can't do it; becau&s;e he has no &s;pecial Gift, that his Crea|tures &s;tand in great need of, and that would tend great|ly to their Happine&s;s, at his own Di&s;po&s;e.&mdash;If this be the Ca&s;e, why do you pray to God to be&s;tow &s;aving Grace upon you? If God don't do fairly to deny it you, becau&s;e he be&s;tows it on others, then 'tis not worth your while to pray for it, but you may go and tell him that he has be&s;towed it on the&s;e and tho&s;e, as bad or wor&s;e than you, and &s;o demand it of him as a Debt.&mdash;And at this Rate Per&s;ons never need to thank God for Salvation, when it is be&s;towed; for what Occa&s;ion is
<PB N="239" REF="004239_0246_10042E51B8A95B18">
there to thank God for that which was not at his own Di&s;po&s;al, and that he could not fairly have denied.&mdash;The Thing at Bottom is, that Men have low Thoughts of God, and high Thoughts of them&s;elves; and there|fore it is that they look upon God as having &s;o little Right, and they &s;o much. Matth. 20 15. <HI>Is it not law|ful for me to do what I will with mine own?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. God may ju&s;tly &s;hew greater Re&s;pect to others than to you, for you have &s;hown greater Re&s;pect to o|thers than to God. You have &s;hown greater Re&s;pect to <HI>Men</HI> than to God: You have rather cho&s;en to offend God than offend Men. God only &s;hews a greater Re&s;pect to others that are by Nature your Equals, than to you; but you have &s;hown a greater Re&s;pect to tho&s;e that are infinitely inferiour to God, than to Him You have &s;hown a greater Regard to <HI>wicked Men,</HI> than to God; you have honoured them more, loved them bet|ter, and adhered to them rather than to Him. Yea, you have honoured the <HI>Devil,</HI> in many Re&s;pects, more than God; you have cho&s;en his Will, and his Intere&s;t, rather than God's Will, and his Glory. You have cho|&s;en a little <HI>worldly Pelf,</HI> rather than God: You have &s;et more by a <HI>vile Lu&s;t,</HI> than by him You have cho&s;en the&s;e Things, and rejected God: You have &s;et your Heart on the&s;e Things, and ca&s;t God behind your Back: And where is the Inju&s;tice if God is plea&s;ed to &s;hew greater Re&s;pect to others than to you, or if he choo&s;es others and rejects you? You have &s;hown great Re&s;pect to vile and worthle&s;s Things, and no Re&s;pect to God's Glory; and why may not God &s;et his Love on others, and have no Re&s;pect to your Happine&s;s? You have &s;hown great Re&s;pect to others, and not to God, that you are laid under infinite Obligations to re&s;pect above all; and why may not God &s;hew Re&s;pect to others, and not to you, that never have laid him under the lea&s;t Obligation?</P>
<P>And will you not be a&s;hamed, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Things, &s;till to open your Mouth, to object and cavil about the Decrees of God, and other Things that you can't fully under&s;tand.&mdash;Let the Decrees of God

be what they will, that alters not the Ca&s;e as to your Liberty, any more than if God had only fore known.&mdash;And why is God to blame for decreeing Things? How unbecoming an infinitely wi&s;e Being, would it have been to have made a World and let Things run at Random, without di&s;po&s;ing Events, or fore ordering how they &s;hould come to pa&s;s? And what is that to you, how God has fore-ordered Things, as long as your con|&s;tant Experience teaches you, that that don't hinder your Liberty, or your doing what you choo&s;e to do. This you know, and your daily Practice and Behaviour a|mong&s;t Men declares that you are fully &s;en&s;ible of it, with Re&s;pect to your &s;elf and others. And &s;till to ob|ject, becau&s;e there are &s;ome Things in God's Di&s;pen&s;a|tions above your Under&s;tanding, is exceeding unrea&s;ona|ble. Your own Con&s;cience charges you with great Guilt, and with tho&s;e Things that have been mention'd, let the &s;ecret Things of God be what they will. Your Con&s;cience charges you with tho&s;e vile Di&s;po&s;itions, and that ba&s;e Behaviour towards God, that you would at any Time mo&s;t highly re&s;ent in your Neighbour to|wards you, and that not a Whit the le&s;s for any Concern tho&s;e &s;ecret Coun&s;els and my&s;terious Di&s;pen&s;ations of God, may have in the Matter.&mdash;It is in Vain for you to exalt your &s;elf again&s;t an infinitely great, and holy, and ju&s;t God: If you continue in it it will be to your eternal Shame and Confu&s;ion, when hereafter you &s;hall &s;ee at who&s;e Door all the Blame of your Mi&s;ery lies.</P>
<P>I will fini&s;h what I have to &s;ay to natural Men, in the Application of this Doctrine, with a <HI>Caution</HI> not to im|prove the Doctrine to Di&s;couragement. For though it would be righteous in God forever to ca&s;t you off, and de&s;troy you, yet it will al&s;o be ju&s;t in God to &s;ave you, in and through Chri&s;t, who has made compleat Satisfac|tion for all Sin. Rom. 3 25, 26 <HI>Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, to de|clare his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins that are pa&s;t, through the Forbearance of God; To declare, I &s;ay, at this Time his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that he might be ju&s;t, and the Ju&s;tifier of him which believeth in Je&s;us.</HI> Yea, God
<PB N="241" REF="004239_0248_10040506528541B8">
may through this Mediator, not only ju&s;tly, but honour|ably, &s;hew you Mercy. The Blood of Chri&s;t is &s;o pre|cious, that it is fully &s;ufficient to pay that Debt that you have contracted, and perfectly to vindicate the divine Maje&s;ty from all that Di&s;honour that has been ca&s;t up|on it, by tho&s;e many great Sins of yours that have been mentioned. It was as great, and indeed a much greater Thing, for Chri&s;t to die, than it would have been for you, and all Mankind, to have burnt in Hell to all Eter|nity. Of &s;uch Dignity and Excellency is Chri&s;t in the Eyes of God, that &s;eeing he has &s;uffered &s;o much for poor Sinners, God is willing to be at Peace with them, however vile and unworthy they have been, and on how many Accounts &s;o ever the Puni&s;hment would be ju&s;t. So that you need not be at all di&s;couraged from &s;eeking Mercy, for there is enough in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Indeed it would not become the Glory of God's Ma|je&s;ty, to &s;hew Mercy to you, that have been &s;o &s;inful and vile a Creature, for any Thing that you have done, for &s;uch worthle&s;s and de&s;picable Things as your Pray|ers, and other religious Performances; it would be very di&s;honourable and unworthy of God &s;o to do, and it is in vain to expect it: He will &s;hew Mercy only on Chri&s;t's Account, and that according to his &s;overeign Plea&s;ure, <HI>on whom</HI> he plea&s;es, <HI>when</HI> he plea&s;es, and <HI>in what Manner</HI> he plea&s;es: You can't bring him under Obligation by your Works; do what you will, he will not look on him&s;elf obliged. But if it be his Plea&s;ure, he can honourably &s;hew Mercy through Chri&s;t, to any Sinner of you all, not one in this Congregation ex|cepted.</P>
<P>Therefore here is Encouragement for you &s;till to &s;eek and wait, notwith&s;tanding all your Wickedne&s;s; agrea|ble to <HI>Samuel's</HI> Speech to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when they were terrified with the Thunder and Rain that God &s;ent, and their Guilt &s;tared them in the Face, 1 Sam 12 20 <HI>Fear not; ye have done all this Wicked|ne&s;s; yet turn not a&s;ide from following the Lord; but &s;erve the Lord with all your Hearts.</HI></P>

I would conclude this Di&s;cour&s;e, by improving the Doctrine in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place, very briefly to put the godly in Mind of the Freene&s;s and Wonderfulne&s;s of the Grace of God towards them. <HI>For &s;uch were &s;ome of you.</HI>&mdash;The Ca&s;e was ju&s;t &s;o with you, as you have heard; you had &s;uch a wicked Heart, you lived &s;uch a wicked Life, and it would have been mo&s;t ju&s;t with God for ever to have ca&s;t you off: but he has had Mercy upon you; he hath made his glorious Grace appear in your everla&s;ting Salvation. You behaved your &s;elf &s;o as you have heard towards God; you had no Love to God, but yet he has exerci&s;ed un&s;peakable Love to you: You have contemned God, and &s;et Light by him; but &s;o great a Value has God's Grace &s;et on you, and your Happine&s;s, that you have been redeemed at the Price of the Blood of his own Son: You cho&s;e to be with <HI>Satan</HI> in <HI>his Service;</HI> but yet God hath made you a Joint-Heir with <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> of <HI>his Glory:</HI> You was ungrateful for pa&s;t Mercies, but yet God not only continued tho&s;e Mercies, but be&s;towed un&s;peakably greater Mercies up|on you: You refu&s;ed to hear when <HI>God called;</HI> but yet God heard you, when <HI>you called:</HI> You abu&s;ed the Infi|nitene&s;s of God's Mercy to encourage your &s;elf in Sin again&s;t God; but yet God has manife&s;ted the Infinite|ne&s;s of that Mercy, in the Exerci&s;es of it towards you: You have r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">cted Chri&s;t, and &s;et him at nought; and yet he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your Saviour: You have neglected your own Salvation; but God has not neglected it: You have de&s;troyed your &s;elf; but yet in God has been your Help<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> God has magnified his free Grace towards you and not to others; becau&s;e he has cho&s;en you, and it hath plea&s;ed him to &s;et his Love upon you.</P>
<P>O! What Cau&s;e is here for Prai&s;e? What Obligati|ons are upon you to ble&s;s the Lord, who hath dealt bountifully with you, and to magnify his holy Name?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Vi&s;ions and Revelations that the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> had of the future Events of God's Providence, are here introdu|ced with a Vi&s;ion of the Book of God's Decrees, by which tho&s;e Events were fore ordained; which is repre&s;ented in the fir&s;t Ver&s;e of this Chapter, as a Book in the Right Hand of him that &s;at on the Throne, <HI>written within, and on the back Side, and &s;ealed with &s;even Seals.</HI> Books in the Form in which
<PB N="245" REF="004239_0252_10042E6E4F5A4C40">
they were wont of old to be made, were broad Leaves of Parchment, or Paper, or &s;ome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hing of that Nature, join|ed together at one Edge, and &s;o rolled up together, and then &s;ealed, or &s;ome Way fa&s;ten'd together, to prevent their unfolding and opening. Hence we read of the Roll of a Book, <HI>Jer.</HI> 36. 2. It &s;eems to have been &s;uch a Book that <HI>John</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d a Vi&s;ion of here; and therefore 'tis &s;aid to be <HI>written within, and on the back Side,</HI> i. e. on the in&s;ide Pages, and al&s;o on one of the out&s;ide Pages, <HI>viz.</HI> that that was rolled in, in the rolling the Book up together. And it is &s;aid to be <HI>&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led with &s;even Seals,</HI> to &s;ignify that what was written in it was perfect|ly hidden and &s;ecret; or that God's Decrees of future Events are &s;ealed, and &s;hut up from all Po&s;&s;ibility of be|ing di&s;covered by Creatures, till God is plea&s;ed to make them known. We find that &s;even is often u&s;ed in Scrip|ture as the <HI>Number of Perfection,</HI> to &s;ignify the &s;uper|lative, or mo&s;t perf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ct Degree of any Thing; which probably c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me from that, that on the <HI>&s;eventh Day</HI> God beheld the Works of Creation fini&s;hed, and re&s;ted and rejoyced in them, as being compleat and perfect.</P>
<P>When <HI>John</HI> &s;aw this Book, he tells us he <HI>&s;aw a &s;trong Angel proclaiming with a loud Voice, Who is worthy to open the Book, and to loo&s;e the Seals thereof? And no Man in Heaven, nor in Earth, neither under the Earth, was able to open the Book, neither to look thereon:</HI> And that he <HI>wept much, becau&s;e no Man was found worthy to open and read the Book, neither to look thereon.</HI> And then tells us how his Tears were dried up, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>one of the Elders &s;aid unto him, Weep not; Behold the Lion of the Tribe of</HI> Judah <HI>hath prevailed,</HI> &amp;c&mdash;as in the Text. Though no Man nor Angel, nor any meer Creature, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound either able to loo&s;e the Seals, or worthy to be admitted to the Privilege of Reading the Book, yet this was declared, for the Comfort of this beloved Di&s;ciple, that Chri&s;t was found both able and worthy. And we have an Account in the &s;ucceeding Chapters how he ac|tually did it, opening the Seals in Order, fir&s;t one, and then another, rev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aling what God had decreed &s;hould come to pa&s;s hereafter. And we have an Account in
<PB N="246" REF="004239_0253_10042E7136F34E78">
this Chapter, of his coming and taking the Book out of the Right Hand of him that &s;at on the Throne, and of the joyful Prai&s;es that were &s;ung to him, in Heaven and Earth, on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Many Things might be ob&s;erved in the Words of the Text; but 'tis to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e only to take No|tice of the two di&s;tinct Appellations here given to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. He is called a <HI>Lion. Behold the</HI> Lion <HI>of the Tribe of</HI> Judah. He &s;eems to be called the <HI>Lion</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> in Allu&s;ion to what <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;aid, in his ble&s;&s;ing of the Tribes on his Death Bed, who when he came to ble&s;s <HI>Judah,</HI> compares him to a <HI>Lion,</HI> Gen. 49. 9. Judah <HI>is a</HI> Lion's <HI>Whelp: From the Prey my Son ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> thou gone up: H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tooped down, he couched as a</HI> Lion, <HI>and as an old</HI> Lion; <HI>who &s;hall rai&s;e him up?</HI> And al&s;o to the Standard of the Camp of <HI>Judah</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s, on which was di&s;played a <HI>Lion,</HI> according to the ancient Tradition of the <HI>Jews.</HI> 'Tis much on Account of the valiant Acts of <HI>David,</HI> that the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> of which <HI>David</HI> was, is in <HI>Jacob'</HI>s prophetical Ble&s;&s;ing compared to a <HI>Lion;</HI> but more e&s;pecially with an Eye to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who al&s;o was of that Tribe, and was de|&s;cended of <HI>David,</HI> and is in our Text called the <HI>Root of David;</HI> and therefore Chri&s;t is here called the <HI>Lion of the Tribe of</HI> Judah.</P>
<P N="2">2. He is called a <HI>Lamb. John</HI> was told of a <HI>Lion</HI> that had prevailed to open the Book, and probably expected to &s;ee a <HI>Lion</HI> in his Vi&s;ion; but while he is expecting, behold a <HI>Lamb</HI> appears to open the Book, an exceeding diver&s;e Kind of Creature from a <HI>Lion!</HI> A <HI>Lion</HI> is a De|vourer, one that is wont to make terrible Slaughter of others; and no Creature more ea&s;ily falls a Prey to him than a <HI>Lamb.</HI> And Chri&s;t is here repre&s;ented not only as a <HI>Lamb,</HI> a Creature very <HI>liable to be &s;lain,</HI> but a <HI>Lamb as it had been &s;lain,</HI> that is, with the Marks of it's dead|ly Wounds appearing on it.</P>
<P>That which I would ob&s;erve from the Words, for the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="247" REF="004239_0254_10042E76A8B04A50">
There is an admirable Conjunction of diver&s;e Excellen|cies in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q>
<P>The <HI>Lion</HI> and the <HI>Lamb,</HI> though very diver&s;e Kinds of Creatures, yet have each their peculiar Excellencies. The <HI>Lion</HI> excells in Strength, and in the Maje&s;ty of his Appearance and Voice. The <HI>Lamb</HI> excells in Meekne&s;s and Patience, be&s;ides the excellent Nature of the Crea|ture as good for Food, and yielding that which is fit for our Cloathing, and being &s;utable to be offered in Sacri|fice to God. But we &s;ee that Chri&s;t is in the Text compared to both; becau&s;e the diver&s;e Excellencies of both wonderfully meet in him.</P>
<P>In handling this Subject, I would</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Shew wherein there is an admirable Conjuncti|on of diver&s;e Excellencies in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> How this admirable Conjunction of Excel|lencies appears in Chri&s;t's Acts.</P>
<P>And then make Application.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> I would &s;hew wherein there is an admirable Conjunction of diver&s;e Excellencies in J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;us Chri&s;t. Which appears in three Things,</P>
<P>I. There is a Conjunction of &s;uch Excellencies in Chri&s;t, as, <HI>in our Manner of conceiving,</HI> are very diver&s;e one from another.</P>
<P>II. There is in him a Conjunction of &s;uch <HI>really</HI> di|ver&s;e Excellencies, as otherwi&s;e would have &s;eemed to us utterly incompatible in <HI>the &s;ame Subject.</HI></P>
<P>III. Such diver&s;e Excellencies are exerci&s;ed in him towards Men, that otherwi&s;e would have &s;eemed impo&s;|&s;ible to be exerci&s;ed towards <HI>the &s;ame Object.</HI></P>
<P>I. <HI>There is a Conjunction of &s;uch Excellencies in Chri&s;t. as,</HI> in our Manner of conceiving, <HI>are very diver&s;e one from another.</HI> Such are the various <HI>divine</HI> Perfections and Excellencies that Chri&s;t is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. Chri&s;t is a divine Per&s;on, or one that is God; and therefore has all
<PB N="248" REF="004239_0255_10042E7B492483E0">
the Attributes of God. The Difference there is be|tween the&s;e is chiefly relative, and in our Manner of conceiving of them. And tho&s;e that in this Sen&s;e are mo&s;t Diver&s;e, do meet in the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t. I &s;hall mention two In&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1. There do meet in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, infinite <HI>Highne&s;s,</HI> and infinite <HI>Conde&s;cen&s;ion</HI> Chri&s;t, as he is God, is infinite|ly <HI>great</HI> and <HI>high</HI> above all. He is higher than the Kings of the Earth; for he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. He is higher than the Heavens, and higher than the highe&s;t Angels of Heaven. So great is He, that all Men, all Kings and Princes, are as Worms of the Du&s;t before him, all Nations are as the Drop of the Bucket, and the light Du&s;t of the Balance; yea, and Angels them&s;elves are as nothing before him. He is &s;o high, that he is infinitely above any Need of us; above our Reach, that we cannot be profitable to him, and above our Conceptions, that we cannot comprehend him. Prov. 30 4. <HI>What is his Name, and</HI> what is his Son's Name, <HI>if thou can&s;t tell?</HI> Our Under&s;tandings, if we &s;tretch them never &s;o far, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n't reach up to his di|vine Glory. Job 11. 8 <HI>It is high as Heaven, what can&s;t tho <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> do?</HI>&mdash;Chri&s;t is the Creator, and great Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and Earth: He is &s;overeign Lord of all: He rules over the whole Univer&s;e, and doth what&s;oe|ver plea&s;eth him: H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Knowlege is without Bound: His Wi&s;dom is perfect, and what none can circumvent: His Power is infinite, and none can re&s;i&s;t him: His Riches are immen&s;e and inexhau&s;table: His Maje&s;ty is infi|nitely awful.</P>
<P>And yet he is one of infinite <HI>Conde&s;cen&s;ion.</HI> None are &s;o low, or in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eriour, but Chri&s;t's Conde&s;cen&s;ion is &s;uffici|ent to take a gracious Notice of them. He conde&s;cends not only to the Angels, humbling him&s;elf to behold the Things that are done in Heaven, but he al&s;o con|de&s;cends to &s;uch poor Creatures as Men; and that not only &s;o as to take Notice of Princes and great Men, but of tho&s;e that are of meane&s;t Rank and Degree, <HI>the Poor of the World,</HI> James, 2 5. Such as are commonly de|&s;pi&s;ed by their Follow Creatures, Chri&s;t don't de&s;pi&s;e.
<PB N="249" REF="004239_0256_10042E81F8054F00">
1 Cor. 1. 28. <HI>Ba&s;e Things of the World, and Things that are de&s;pi&s;ed, hath God cho&s;en.</HI> Chri&s;t conde&s;cends to take Notice of <HI>Beggars, Luke.</HI> 16 22. and of <HI>Servants,</HI> and People of the mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed Nations: In Chri&s;t Je&s;us is neither <HI>Barbarian, Sythian, Bond, nor Free,</HI> Col. 3. 11. He that is thus high, conde&s;cends to take a gracious Notice of <HI>little Children,</HI> Matth. 19. 14. <HI>Suffer little Children to come unto me.</HI> Yea, which is much more, his Conde|&s;cen&s;ion is &s;ufficient to take a gracious Notice of the mo&s;t <HI>unworthy, &s;inful</HI> Creatures, tho&s;e that have no good De&s;ervings, and tho&s;e that have infinite ill De&s;ervings.</P>
<P>Yea, &s;o great is his Conde&s;cen&s;ion, that it is not only &s;ufficient to take &s;ome gracious Notice of &s;uch as the&s;e, but &s;ufficient for every Thing that is an Act of Conde&s;cen|&s;ion. His Conde&s;cen&s;ion is great enough to <HI>become their Friend:</HI> 'Tis great enough to become their <HI>Companion,</HI> to unite their Souls to him in &s;piritual Marriage: 'Tis great enough to <HI>take their Nature upon him,</HI> to become one <HI>of</HI> them, that he may be one <HI>with</HI> them: Yea, it is great enough to aba&s;e him&s;elf yet lower for them, even to expo&s;e him&s;elf to Shame and Spitting; yea, to yield up him&s;elf to an <HI>ignominious Death</HI> for them. And what Act of Conde&s;cen&s;ion can be conceived of greater? Yet &s;uch an Act as this, has his Conde&s;cen&s;ion yielded to, for tho&s;e that are &s;o low and mean, de&s;picable and unworthy!</P>
<P>Such a Conjunction of &s;uch <HI>infinite Highne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>low Conde&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> in the &s;ame Per&s;on, is admirable. We &s;ee by manifold In&s;tances, what a Tendency an high Station has in Men, to make them to be of a quite contrary Di&s;po&s;ition. If one Worm be a little exalted above ano|ther, by having more Du&s;t, or a bigger Dunghill, how much does he make of him&s;elf! What a Di&s;tance does he keep from tho&s;e that are below him! And a <HI>little</HI> Conde&s;cen&s;ion, is what he expects &s;hould be made much of, and greatly acknowleged. Chri&s;t conde&s;cends to wa&s;h our Feet; but how would great Men, (or rather the bigger Worms,) account them&s;elves deba&s;ed by Acts of far le&s;s Conde&s;cen&s;ion!</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="250" REF="004239_0257_10042E86A45C7CA8">
2.

<P>And yet he is one that is infinitely gracious and mer|ciful. Though his Ju&s;tice be &s;o &s;trict with Re&s;pect to all Sin, and every Breach of the Law, yet he has Grace &s;ufficient for every Sinner, and even the chief of Sinners. And it is not only &s;ufficient for the mo&s;t unworthy to &s;how them Mercy, and be&s;tow <HI>&s;ome</HI> good upon them, but to be&s;tow the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> Good; yea, 'tis &s;ufficient to be|&s;tow <HI>all</HI> Good <HI>upon</HI> them, and to do all Things <HI>for</HI> them. There is no Benefit or Ble&s;&s;ing that they can receive &s;o great, but the Grace of Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient to be&s;tow it on the greate&s;t Sinner that ever lived. And not only &s;o, but &s;o great is his Grace, that nothing is too much as <HI>the Means</HI> of this Good: 'Tis &s;ufficient not only to <HI>do</HI> great Things, but al&s;o to <HI>&s;uffer</HI> in order to it; and not only to &s;uffer, but to &s;uffer <HI>mo&s;t extremely,</HI> even <HI>unto Death,</HI> the mo&s;t terrible of natural Evils; and not only Death, but the mo&s;t <HI>ignominious&amp;tormenting,</HI> and every Way the <HI>mo&s;t terrible Death</HI> that Men could inflict; yea, and <HI>greater Sufferings than Men could inflict,</HI> who could only torment the Body, but al&s;o tho&s;e Suffer|ings in his Soul, that were the more immediate Fruits of the Wrath of God again&s;t the Sins of tho&s;e he under|takes for.</P>
<P>II. <HI>There do meet in the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, &s;uch</HI> really <HI>diver&s;e Excellencies, which otherwi&s;e would have been thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">terly incompatible in the</HI> &s;ame Subject; &s;uch as are conjoined in no other Per&s;on whatever, either divine, human, or angelical; and &s;uch as neither Men nor Angels would ever have imagined could have met together in the &s;ame Per&s;on, had it not been &s;een in the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t. I would give &s;ome In&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t do meet together, infinite <HI>Glory,</HI> and the lowe&s;t <HI>Humility.</HI> Infinite Glory, and

the Virtue of Humility, meet in no other Per&s;on but Chri&s;t. They meet in no created Per&s;on; for no created Per&s;on has infinite Glory: And they meet in no other divine Per&s;on but Chri&s;t. For though the divine Na|ture be infinitely abhorrent to Pride, yet Humility is not properly predicable of God the Father, and the Holy Gho&s;t, that exi&s;t only in the divine Nature; be|cau&s;e it is a proper Excellency only of a created Nature; for it con&s;i&s;ts radically in a Sen&s;e of a comparative Lowne&s;s and Littlene&s;s before God, or the great Di&s;tance be|tween God and the Subject of this Virtue; but it would be a Contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e any &s;uch Thing in God.</P>
<P>But in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is both God and Man, the&s;e two diver&s;e Excellencies, are &s;weetly united. He is a Per&s;on infinitely exalted in Glory &amp; Dignity. Phil. 2. 6. <HI>Being in the Form of God, he thought it not Robbery to be equal with God.</HI> There is equal Honour due to him with the Father. John 5. 23.&mdash;<HI>That all Men &s;hould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</HI> God him&s;elf &s;ays to him, <HI>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever,</HI> Heb. 1. 8. And there is the &s;ame &s;upreme Re&s;pect, and divine Wor&s;hip, paid to him by the Angels of Hea|ven, as to God the Father; as there, Ver&s;e 6. <HI>Let all the Angels of God wor&s;hip him.</HI></P>
<P>But however he is thus <HI>above all,</HI> yet he is <HI>lowe&s;t of all</HI> in Humility. There never was &s;o great an In&s;tance of this Virtue, among either Men or Angels, as <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> None ever was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Di&s;tance between God and him, or had a Heart &s;o lowly before God, as the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>Matth.</HI> 11. 29. What a wonderful Spirit of Humility appeared in him, when he was here upon Earth, in all his Behaviour! In his Contentment in his mean outward Condition, contentedly living in the Family of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> the Carpenter, and <HI>Mary</HI> his Mo|ther, for thirty Years together, and afterwards choo&s;ing outward Meanne&s;s, Poverty and Contempt, rather than earthly Greatne&s;s; in his wa&s;hing his Di&s;ciples Feet, and in all his Speeches and Deportment towards them; in his cheerfully &s;u&s;taining the Form of a Servant thro' his whole Life, and &s;ubmitting to &s;uch immen&s;e Humili|ation at Death!</P>

2. In the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t do meet together, infinite <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> and tran&s;cendent <HI>Meekne&s;s.</HI> The&s;e again are two Qualifications that meet together in no other Per|&s;on but Chri&s;t. Meekne&s;s, properly &s;o called, is a Vir|tue proper only to the Creature: We &s;carcely ever find Meekne&s;s mentioned as a divine Attribute in Scrip|ture; at lea&s;t not in the New Te&s;tament; for thereby &s;eems to be &s;ignified, a Calmne&s;s and Quietne&s;s of Spirit ari&s;ing from Humility, in mutable Beings, that are na|turally liable to be put into a Ruffle, by the A&s;&s;aults of a tempe&s;tuous and injurious World. But Chri&s;t being both God and Man, hath both infinite Maje&s;ty and &s;u|perlative Meekne&s;s.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t was a Per&s;on of infinite <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI> It is he that is &s;poken of, P&s;alm. 45. 3. <HI>Gird thy Sword upon thy Thigh, O mo&s;t mighty, in thy Glory and thy Maje&s;ty.</HI> 'Tis he that is mighty, that rideth on the Heavens, and in his Excellency on the Sky. 'Tis he that is terrible out of his holy Places; who is mightier than the Noi&s;e of many Waters, yea, than the mighty Waves of the Sea; before whom a Fire goeth, and burneth up his Enemies round about; at who&s;e Pre&s;ence the Earth doth quake, and the Hills do melt; who &s;itteth on the Circle of the Earth, and all the Inhabitants thereof are as Gra&s;hop|pers; who rebukes the Sea and maketh it dry, and dri|eth up the Rivers; who&s;e Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, from who&s;e Pre&s;ence, and from the Glory of who&s;e Power, the Wicked &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting De&s;truction; who is the ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that hath Heaven for his Throne, and the Earth for his Foot&s;tool, and is the high and lofty One who inhabits Eternity, who&s;e Kingdom is an everla&s;ting Kingdom, and of who&s;e Do|minion there is no End.</P>
<P>And yet he was the mo&s;t marvellous In&s;tance of <HI>Meekne&s;s,</HI> and humble <HI>Quietne&s;s</HI> of Spirit, that ever was, agreable to the Prophecies of him. Matth. 21. 4, 5. <HI>All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was &s;poken by the Prophet, &s;aying, Tell ye the Daughter of</HI> Sion, <HI>behold thy King cometh unto thee, Meek, and &s;itting

upon an A&s;s, and a Colt the Fole of an A&s;s.</HI> And agre|able to what Chri&s;t declares of him&s;elf, Matth. 11. 29. <HI>I am meek and lowly of Heart.</HI> And agreable to what was manife&s;t in his Behaviour here in this World. For there never was &s;uch an In&s;tance &s;een on Earth of a meek Behaviour, under Injuries &amp; Reproaches, &amp; towards Enemies; who when he was reviled, reviled not again; who was of a wonderful Spirit of Forgivene&s;s, was ready to forgive his wor&s;t Enemies, and prayed for them with &s;ervent and effectual Prayers. With what Meekne&s;s did he appear, when in the Ring of Soldiers, that were con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mning and mocking him, when he was &s;ilent, and opened not his Mouth, but went as a <HI>Lamb</HI> to the Slaughter. Thus is Chri&s;t a <HI>Lion</HI> in Maje&s;ty, and a <HI>Lamb</HI> in Meekne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. There meet in the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, the deepe&s;t <HI>Reverence</HI> towards God, and <HI>Equality</HI> with God. Chri&s;t, when he was here on Earth, appeared full of holy <HI>Re|verence</HI> towards the Father: He paid the mo&s;t reveren|tial Wor&s;hip to him, praying to him with Po&s;tures of Reverence. Thus we read of his <HI>kneeling down and praying,</HI> Matth. 22. 41. This became Chri&s;t, as he was one that had taken on him the human Nature. But at the &s;ame Time he exi&s;ted in the divine Nature; where|by his Per&s;on was in all Re&s;pects <HI>equal</HI> to the Per&s;on of the Father. God the Father hath no Attribute or Perfection, that the Son hath not, in <HI>equal</HI> Degree, and <HI>equal</HI> Glory. The&s;e Things meet in no other Per&s;on but Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. There are conjoined in the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, infinite <HI>Worthine&s;s of Good,</HI> and the greate&s;t <HI>Patience under Suf|ferings of Evil.</HI> He was perfectly innocent, and de&s;er|ved no Suffering. He de&s;erved nothing from God, by any Guilt of his own; and he de&s;erved no Ill from Men. Yea, he was not only harmle&s;s, and unde&s;erving of Suf|fering, but he was infinitely worthy, worthy of the in|finite Love of the Father, worthy of infinite and eternal Happine&s;s, and infinitely worthy of all po&s;&s;ible E&s;teem, Love, and Service from all Men. And yet he was per|fectly patient under the greate&s;t Sufferings, that ever
<PB N="254" REF="004239_0261_10042E9A512488D8">
were endured in this World. Heb. 6. 15. <HI>After he had patiently endured, he obtained the Promi&s;e.</HI> He &s;uffered not from his Father, for <HI>his</HI> Faults, but <HI>ours;</HI> and he &s;uffered from Men&punc; not for his <HI>Faults,</HI> but for tho&s;e Things, on Account of which, he was infinitely worthy of their Love and Honour; which made his Patience the more wonderful, and the more glorious. 1 Pet. 2. 20, &amp;c. <HI>For what Glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it if when ye be buffeted for your Faults, ye &s;hall take it patiently? But if when ye do well, and &s;uffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is accep|table with God: For even hereunto were ye called be|cau&s;e Chri&s;t al&s;o &s;uffered for us, leaving us an Example, that we &s;hould follow his Steps; who did no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth; who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he &s;uffered he threatened not, but committed him&s;elf to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly: Who his own &s;elf, bare our Sins in his own Body, on the Tree, that we being dead to Sin, &s;hould live unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s; by who&s;e Stripes ye were healed.</HI> There is no &s;uch Con|junction of Innocence, Worthine&s;s, and Patience under Sufferings, as in the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. In the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t are conjoined, an exceed|ing <HI>Spirit of Obedience,</HI> with <HI>&s;upreme Dominion</HI> over Hea|ven and Earth. Chri&s;t is the Lord of all Things, in two Re&s;pects. He is &s;o as he is God-Man, and Mediator; and &s;o his Dominion is appointed, and given of the Fa|ther, and is by Delegation from God, and he is as it were the Father's <HI>Vicegerent</HI> But he is Lord of all Things in another Re&s;pect, <HI>viz.</HI> as he is, (by his origi|nal Nature) God. And &s;o he is by natural Right, the Lord of all, and &s;upreme over all, as much as the Father. Thus he has Dominion over the World, not by Dele|gation, but in his own Right: He is not an <HI>Under God,</HI> as the <HI>Asians</HI> &s;uppo&s;e, but to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, &s;upreme God.</P>
<P>And yet, in the &s;ame Per&s;on, is found the greate&s;t <HI>Spirit of Obedience</HI> to the Commands and Law of God that ever was in the Univer&s;e; which was manife&s;t in his Obedience here in this World&punc; John. 14 31. <HI>As the Father gave me Commandment, even &s;o I do.</HI> John. 15 10.
<PB N="255" REF="004239_0262_10042EA2D2846AE0">
<HI>Even as I have kept my Father's Commandments, and abide in his Love.</HI> The Greatne&s;s of his Spirit of Obedience appears in the Perfection of his Obedience, and in his obeying Commands of &s;uch exceeding Difficulty. Never any one received Commands from God, of &s;uch Difficul|ty, and that were &s;o great a Trial of Obedience, as Je&s;us Chri&s;t. One of God's Commands to him was, that he &s;hould yield him&s;elf to tho&s;e dreadful Sufferings that he underwent. See John 10. 18. <HI>No Man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my &s;elf.&mdash;This Commandment received I of my Father.</HI> And Chri&s;t was throughly obedient to this Command of God. Heb. 5. 8. <HI>Though he were a Son, yet learned he Obedience by the Things that he &s;uffered.</HI> Philip. 2 8. <HI>He humbled him&s;elf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s.</HI> Never was there &s;uch an In&s;tance of Obedience in <HI>Man nor Angel,</HI> as this; though he that obeyed was at the &s;ame Time, &s;upreme Lord of both <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. In the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t are conjoined ab&s;olute <HI>So|vereignty,</HI> and perfect <HI>Re&s;ignation.</HI> This is another un|parallel'd Conjunction. Chri&s;t as he is God, is the ab|&s;olute <HI>Sovereign</HI> of the World: He is the &s;overeign Di&s;|po&s;er of all Events. The Decrees of God are all his &s;overeign Decrees; and the Work of Creation, and all God's Works of Providence, are his &s;overeign Works. 'Tis he that worketh all Things according to the Coun|&s;el of his own Will. Col. 1. 16, 17. <HI>By him,</HI> and <HI>thro' him,</HI> and <HI>to him,</HI> are all Things. John. 15. 17. <HI>The Fa|ther worketh hitherto, and I work.</HI> Matth. 8. 3. <HI>I will, be thou clean.</HI></P>
<P>But yet Chri&s;t was the mo&s;t wonderful In&s;tance of <HI>Re&s;ignation,</HI> that ever appeared in the World. He was ab&s;olutely and perfectly re&s;igned, when he had a near, and immediate Pro&s;pect of his terrible Sufferings, and the dreadful Cup that he was to drink, the Idea and Expectation of which, made his Soul exceeding Sorrow|ful, even unto Death, and put him into &s;uch an Agony, that his Sweat was as it were great Drops, or Clots of Blood, falling down to the Ground. But in &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances, be was wholly re&s;igned to the Will of God.
<PB N="256" REF="004239_0263_1004050E61BD44A0">
Matth. 26. 39. <HI>O my Father, if it be po&s;&s;ible, let this Cup pa&s;s from me! Neverthele&s;s, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI> Ver&s;e 42. <HI>O my Father, if this Cup may not pa&s;s from me, except I drink it, Thy Will be done!</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. In Chri&s;t do meet together, <HI>Self-&s;ufficiency,</HI> and an intire <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> and <HI>Reliance</HI> on God; which is another Conjunction peculiar to the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t. As he is a divine Per&s;on he is <HI>&s;elf-&s;ufficient,</HI> &s;tanding in Need of nothing; all Creatures are dependent on him, but he is dependent on none, but is ab&s;olutely independent. His Proceeding from the Father in his eternal Generati|on, or Filiation, argues no proper Dependance on the Will of the Father; for that Proceeding was natural and nece&s;&s;ary, and not arbitrary. But yet Chri&s;t intirely <HI>tru&s;ted</HI> in God: His Enemies &s;ay that of him, <HI>He tru&s;ted in God that he would deliver him,</HI> Matth. 27. 43. And the Apo&s;tle te&s;tifies, 1 Pet. 2. 23. That <HI>he committed him&s;elf to God.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Such diver&s;e Excellencies are expre&s;s'd in him to|wards Men, that otherwi&s;e would have &s;eem'd impo&s;&s;ible to be exerci&s;ed towards the</HI> &s;ame Object; as particularly the&s;e three, <HI>Ju&s;tice, Mercy</HI> and <HI>Truth.</HI> The &s;ame that are mentioned, P&s;alm. 85. 10. <HI>Mercy and Truth are met together, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other.</HI> The &s;trict <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of God, and even his <HI>revenging Ju&s;tice,</HI> and that <HI>again&s;t the Sins of Men,</HI> never was &s;o gloriou&s;ly manife&s;ted as in Chri&s;t. He manife&s;ted an infinite Re|gard to the Attribute of God's Ju&s;tice, in that when he had a Mind to &s;ave Sinners, he was willing to undergo &s;uch extreme Sufferings, rather than that their Salvati|on &s;hould be to the Injury of the Honour of that At|tribute. And as he is the Judge of the World, he doth him&s;elf exerci&s;e &s;trict Ju&s;tice; he will not clear the Guilty, nor at all acquit the Wicked in Judgment. And yet, how wonderfully is <HI>infinite Mercy</HI> towards Sin|ners, di&s;played in him! And what glorious and ineffa|ble <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> have been, and are exerci&s;ed by him, towards <HI>&s;inful Men!</HI> Though he be the <HI>ju&s;t Judge</HI> of a &s;inful World, yet he is al&s;o the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the World:
<PB N="257" REF="004239_0264_10042EA5DE88C9A8">
Though he be a <HI>con&s;uming Fire to Sin,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he is the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Life of Sinners.</HI> Rom. 3. 25, 26 <HI>Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins that are pa&s;t, through the Forbearance of God; To declare, I &s;ay, at this Time, his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he might be ju&s;t, and the Ju&s;tifier of him which believeth in Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>So the immutable <HI>Truth</HI> of God, in the Threatenings of his Law again&s;t the Sins of Men, was never &s;o mani|fe&s;ted, as it is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for there never was any other &s;o great a Trial of the Unalterablene&s;s of the Truth of God, in tho&s;e Threatenings, as when Sin came to be imputed to his own Son. And then in Chri&s;t, has been &s;een already, an actual, compleat Accompli&s;h|ment of tho&s;e Threatenings; which never has been, nor will be &s;een in any other In&s;tance; becau&s;e the E|ternity that will be taken up in fulfilling tho&s;e Threat|nings on others, never will be fini&s;hed. Chri&s;t manife&s;t|ed an infinite Regard to this Truth of God in his Suf|ferings. And in his judging the World, he makes the Covenant of Works that contains tho&s;e dreadful Threat|nings, his Rule of Judgment: He will &s;ee to it that it is not infringed in the lea&s;t Jot or Tittle&punc; he will do nothing contrary to the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of the Law, and their com|pleat Fulfilment. And yet in him <HI>we have many great, and precious Promi&s;es,</HI> Promi&s;es of perfect Deliverance from the <HI>Penalty of the Law. And this is the Promi&s;e that he hath promi&s;ed us, even eternal Life.</HI> And <HI>in him are all the Promi&s;es of God, Yea, and Amen</HI></P>
<P>Having thus &s;hown wherein there is an admirable Conjunction of Excellencies in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I now proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To &s;hew how this admirable Conjunction of Excellencies appears in Chri&s;t's Acts</P>
<P>I It appears <HI>in what Chri&s;t did in taking on him our Nature.</HI> In this Act his infi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;ion</HI> wonder|fully appeared; that he that was God, &s;hould become Man; that the Word &s;hould be made Fle&s;h, and &s;hould
<PB N="258" REF="004239_0265_10042EA77A90C470">
take on him a Nature infinitely below his original Na|ture! And it appears yet more remarkably, in the low Circum&s;tances of his Incarnation: He was conceived in the Womb of a poor young Woman; who&s;e Poverty appeared in that when &s;he came to offer Sacrifices for her Purification, &s;he brought what was allowed of in the Law, only in Ca&s;e of Poverty; as Luke 2 34. <HI>Accord|ing to that which is &s;aid in the Law of the Lord, a Pair of Turtle Doves, or two young Pidgeons.</HI> This was al|lowed only in Ca&s;e the Per&s;on was &s;o Poor, that &s;he was not able to offer a Lamb. <HI>Levit. 12. 8.</HI></P>
<P>And though his infinite Conde&s;cen&s;ion thus appear'd in the Manner of his Incarnation, yet his divine <HI>Dignity</HI> al&s;o appeared in it; for though he was conceived in the Womb of a poor Virgin, yet he was there conceived by the Power of the Holy Gho&s;t. And his divine Dignity al&s;o appeared in the <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of his Conception and Birth. Though he was conceived in the Womb of one of the corrupt Race of Mankind, yet he was conceived and born without Sin; as the Angel &s;aid to the ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin, Luke 1. 35. <HI>The Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall come upon thee, and the Power of the Highe&s;t &s;hall over &s;hadow thee; therefore al&s;o, that holy Thing which &s;hall be born of thee, &s;hall be called the Son of God.</HI></P>
<P>His infinite Conde&s;cen&s;ion marvellou&s;ly appeared in the <HI>Manner of his Birth.</HI> He was brought forth in a Stable, becau&s;e there was no Room for them in the Inn. The Inn was taken up by others, that were looked up|on as Per&s;ons of greater Account. The ble&s;&s;ed Virgin being poor and de&s;pi&s;ed, was turned or &s;hut out; tho' &s;he was in &s;uch nece&s;&s;itous Circum&s;tances, yet tho&s;e that counted them&s;elves her Betters, would not give Place to her; and therefore in the Time of her Travail &s;he was forced to betake her &s;elf to a Stable; and when the Child was born, it was wrapped in Swaddling Cloaths, and laid in a Manger; and there Chri&s;t lay a little In|fant; and there he eminently appeared as a <HI>Lamb.</HI> But yet this feeble Infant that was born thus in a Stable, and laid in a Manger, was born to conquer and triumph over Satan, that roaring <HI>Lion:</HI> He came to &s;ubdue the mighty

<P>II. This admirable Conjunction of Excellencies ap|pears <HI>in the Acts, and various Pa&s;&s;ages of Chri&s;t's Life.</HI> Though Chri&s;t dwelt on the Earth in mean outward Circum&s;tances, whereby his Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Humility e&s;pecially appeared, and his Maje&s;ty was veil'd; yet his divine Dignity and Glory did in many of his Acts &s;hine through the Veil, and it illu&s;triou&s;ly appeared that he was, not only the Son of Man, but, the great God.</P>
<P>Thus in the Circum&s;tances of his Infancy, his outward Meanne&s;s appeared; yet there was &s;omething then to &s;hew forth his divine Dignity, in the wi&s;e Men's being &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r'd up to come from the Ea&s;t to give Honour to him, their being led by a miraculous Star, and coming and falling down and wor&s;hipping him, and pre&s;enting him with Gold, Frankincen&s;e and Myrrh.

<P>And &s;o after he entred on his publick Mini&s;try, his marvellous Humility and Meekne&s;s was manife&s;ted in his choo&s;ing to appear in &s;uch mean outward Circum|&s;tances, and in being &s;o contented in them, when he was &s;o Poor that he had not where to lay his Head, and de|pended on the Charity of &s;ome of his Followers for his Sub&s;i&s;tence; as appears by <HI>Luke.</HI> 8. <HI>at the begin.</HI> As al&s;o in his meek, conde&s;cending&punc; and familiar Treatment of his

In healing the Sick, and opening the Eyes of the Blind, and un&s;topping the Ears of the Deaf, and healing the Lame, he &s;hewed that he was the God that framed the Eye, and created the Ear, and was the Author of the Frame of Man's Body.

<P>And tho' Chri&s;t ordinarily appeared without outward Glory, and in great Ob&s;curity, yet at a certain Time he threw off the Veil, and appeared in his divine Maje&s;ty, &s;o far as it could be outwardly manife&s;ted to Men in this frail State, when he was transfigured in the Mount.

<P>And at the &s;ame Time that Chri&s;t was wont to appear in &s;uch Meekne&s;s, Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Humility, in his fa|miliar Di&s;cour&s;es with his Di&s;ciples, appearing therein as the <HI>Lamb</HI> of God, he was al&s;o wont to appear as the <HI>Lion</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> with divine Authority and Maje&s;ty, in his &s;o &s;harply rebuking the Scribes and Pha|ri&s;ees, and other Hypocrites.</P>

If you are a poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Sinner, who&s;e Heart is ready to &s;ink for Fear that God never will have Mercy on you, you need not be afraid to go to Chri&s;t, for Fear that he is either una|ble or unwilling to help you: Here is a &s;trong Foun|dation, and an inexhau&s;tible Trea&s;ure, to an&s;wer the Nece&s;&s;ities of your poor Soul; and here is infinite Grace and Gentlene&s;s to invite and embolden a poor unwor|thy fearful Soul to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to it.

<P>Would you choo&s;e a Friend that is a Per&s;on of great Dignity?&mdash;It is a Thing taking with Men to have tho&s;e for their Friends that are much above them; be|cau&s;e they look upon them&s;elves honoured by the Friend&s;hip of &s;uch. Thus how taking would it be with an inferior Maid, to be the Object of the dear Love of &s;ome great and excellent Prince. But Chri&s;t is infinite|ly above you, and above all the Princes of the Earth; for he is the King of Kings.&mdash;So honourable a Per|&s;on as this offers him&s;elf to you, in the neare&s;t and dear|e&s;t Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>And would you choo&s;e to have a Friend not only <HI>great</HI> but <HI>good?</HI>&mdash;In Chri&s;t infinite Greatne&s;s, and in|finite Goodne&s;s meet together, and receive Lu&s;tre and Glory one from another. His Greatne&s;s is render'd love|ly by his Goodne&s;s. The greater any one is without Goodne&s;s, &s;o much the greater <HI>Evil;</HI> but when infinite Goodne&s;s is joined with Greatne&s;s, it renders it a glorious

and adorable Greatne&s;s. So on the other Hand, his in|finite Goodne&s;s receives Lu&s;tre from his Greatne&s;s. He that is of great Under&s;tanding and Ability, and is withal of a good and excellent Di&s;po&s;ition, is de&s;ervedly more e&s;teemed, than a lower and le&s;&s;er Being, with the &s;ame kind Inclination and Good Will. Indeed Goodne&s;s is excellent in whatever Subject it be found; it is Beau|ty and Excellency it &s;elf, and renders all excellent that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; and yet more excellent when joined with Greatne&s;s; as the very &s;ame excellent Qualities of Gold, do render the Body in which they are inherent more precious, and of greater Value, when joined with greater, than when with le&s;&s;er <HI>Dimen&s;ions.</HI> And how glorious is the Sight, to &s;ee him who is the great Crea|tor and &s;upreme Lord of Heaven and Earth, full of Con|de&s;cen&s;ion, and tender Pity and Mercy, towards the mean and unworthy! His almighty Power, and infinite Ma|je&s;ty and Self Sufficiency render his exceeding Love and Grace the more &s;urprizing. And how do his Conde|&s;cen&s;ion and Compa&s;&s;ions endear his Maje&s;ty, Power, and Dominion, and render tho&s;e Attributes <HI>plea&s;ant,</HI> that would otherwi&s;e be only <HI>terrible!</HI> Would you not de|&s;ire that your Friend, though great and honourable, &s;hould be of &s;uch Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Grace, and &s;o to have the Way opened to free Acce&s;s to him, that his Exaltation above you might not hinder your free En|joyment of his Friend&s;hip?</P>
<P>And would you choo&s;e, not only, that the infinite Greatne&s;s and Maje&s;ty of your Friend &s;hould be as it were mollified and &s;weeten'd with Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Grace; but would you al&s;o de&s;ire to have your Friend <HI>in your own Nature,</HI> that he might be brought nearer to you? Would you choo&s;e a Friend <HI>far above you,</HI> and yet as it were <HI>upon a Level with you too?</HI> (Though it be taking with Men to have a near and dear Friend of &s;u|perior Dignity, yet there is al&s;o an Inclination in them to have their Friend a Sharer with them in Circum&s;tan|ces.)

he might not only be your Lord, but your Brother, and that he might be the more fit to be a Companion for &s;uch a Worm of the Du&s;t.&mdash;This is one End of Chri&s;t's taking upon him Man's Nature, that his People might be under Advantages for a more familiar Conver&s;e with him, than the infinite Di&s;tance of the divine Na|ture would allow of. And upon this Account the Church longed for Chri&s;t's Incarnation, Cant. 8. 1. <HI>O thou that wert my Brother, that &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cked the Brea&s;ts of my Mother; when I &s;hould find thee without, I would ki&s;s thee; yea, I &s;hould not be de&s;pi&s;ed.</HI> One De&s;ign of God in the Go&s;pel, is to bring us to make God the Object of our undivided Re&s;pect, that he may engro&s;s our Regard every Way, that whatever natural Inclination there is in our Souls, he may be the Center of it; that God may be <HI>all in all&punc;</HI> But there is an Inclination in the Crea|ture, not only to the Adoration of a Lord and Sovereign, but to Complacence in &s;ome one as a Friend, to love and delight in &s;ome one that may be convers'd with as a Compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ion. And Virtue and Holine&s;s don't de&s;troy or weaken this Inclination of our Nature. But &s;o hath God contrived in the Affair of our Redemption, that a <HI>divine Per&s;on</HI> may be the Object even of this Inclination of our Nature. And in order hereto, &s;uch an one is come down to us, and has taken our Nature, and is become one of us, and calls him&s;elf our Friend, Brother, and Companion. P&s;alm 122. 8. <HI>For my Brethren and Com|panions Sake, will I now &s;ay, Peace be within thee.</HI></P>
<P>But, is it not enough to invite and encourage to free Acce&s;s to a Friend &s;o great and high, that he is one of infinite conde&s;cending Grace, and al&s;o has taken your own Nature, and is become Man? But would you further to embolden and win you, have him a Man of wonderful Meekne&s;s &amp; Humility? Why &s;uch an one is Chri&s;t! He is not only become Man for you, but far the meeke&s;t and mo&s;t humble of all Men, the greate&s;t In|&s;tance of the&s;e &s;weet Virtues, that ever was, or will be. And be&s;ides the&s;e, he has all other <HI>human</HI> Excellencies, in the highe&s;t Perfection. The&s;e indeed are no proper <HI>Addition</HI> to his <HI>divine</HI> Excellencies.

By your choo&s;ing Chri&s;t for your Friend and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you will obtain the&s;e two infinite Benefits.</P>
<P N="1">1. Chri&s;t will give <HI>him&s;elf</HI> to you, with all tho&s;e va|rious Excellencies that meet in him, to your full and everla&s;ting Enjoyment. He will ever after treat you as his dear Friend; and you &s;hall e're long be where he is, and &s;hall behold his Glory, and &s;hall dwell with him, in mo&s;t free &amp; intimate Communion and Enjoyment.</P>
<P>When the Saints get to Heaven, they &s;hall not meer|ly &s;ee Chri&s;t, and have to do with him as Subjects and Servants with a glorious and gracious Lord and Sove|reign, but Chri&s;t will entertain them as Friends and Brethren. This we may learn from the Manner of Chri&s;t's conver&s;ing with his Di&s;ciples here on Earth: Though he was their Sovereign Lord, and did not re|fu&s;e, but required, their &s;upreme Re&s;pect and Adoration, yet he did not treat them as earthly Sovereigns are wont to do their Subjects; he did not keep them at an awful Di&s;tance; but all along conver&s;ed with them with the mo&s;t friendly Familiarity, as a Father among&s;t a Compa|ny of Children, yea, as with Brethren. So he did with the twelve, and &s;o he did with <HI>Mary, Martha</HI> and <HI>La|zarus</HI> He told his Di&s;ciples, that he did not call them Servants, but Friends, and we read of one of them that leaned on his Bo&s;om. And doubtle&s;s he will not treat his Di&s;ciples with le&s;s Freedom and Endearment in Hea|ven: He won't keep them at a greater Di&s;tance for his being in a State of Exaltation; but he will rather take them into a State of Exaltation with him. This will be the Improvement Chri&s;t will make of his own Glory, to make his beloved Friends Partakers with him, to glorify them in his Glory, as he &s;ays to his Father, Joh. 17 22, 23. <HI>And the Glory which thou ha&s;t given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, have I give them, that they may be one, even as we are one, I in them,</HI> &amp;c. We are to con&s;ider, that though Chri&s;t is greatly exalted, yet he is exalted not as a private Per&s;on, for him&s;elf only, but as his People's Head; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> exalted in their Name, and upon their Account, as the Fir&s;t-Fruits, and as repre&s;enting the whole Harve&s;t. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> not ex|alted that he may be at a greater Di&s;tance from them, but
<PB N="283" REF="004239_0290_10042F582902BBC8">
that they may be exalted with him. The Exaltation and Honour of the Head is not to make a greater Di&s;|tance between the Head and the Members; but the Members have the &s;ame Relation and Union with the Head they had before, and are honoured with the Head; and in&s;tead of the Di&s;tance being greater, the Union &s;hall be nearer, and more perfect. When Belie|vers get to Heaven, Chri&s;t will conform them to him&s;elf; as he is &s;et down in his Father's Throne, &s;o they &s;hall &s;it down with him on his Throne, and &s;hall in their Mea&s;ure be made like him.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;t was going to Heaven, he comforted his Di&s;ciples with that, that after a while, he would come again, and take them to him&s;elf, that they might be with him again. And we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that when the Di&s;ciples got to Heaven, they found him keeping a greater Di&s;tance, than he u&s;ed to do. No, doubtle&s;s, he embraced them as Friends, and welcom'd them to his, and their, Father's Hou&s;e, and to his, and their, Glory. They that had been his Friends in this World, that had been together with him here, and had together partook of Sorrows and Troubles, are now welcom'd by him to Re&s;t, and to partake of Glory with him. He took them and led them into his Chambers, and &s;hewed them all h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s Glory; as he prayed, John 17. 24 <HI>Father, I will, that they al&s;o whom thou ha&s;t given me, be with me, that they may behold the Glory which thou ha&s;t given me.</HI> And he led them to his living Fountains of Waters, and made them partake of his Delights; as he prays, John 17. 13. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Joy may be fulfilled in them&s;elves.</HI> And &s;et them down with him at his Table in his Kingdom, and made them partake with him of his Dainties, according to his Promi&s;e, <HI>Luke</HI> 22. 30. And led them into his Banquet|ing-Hou&s;e, and made them to drink new Wine with him in the Kingdom of his heavenly Father; as he fore|told them, when he in&s;tituted the Lord's Supper; <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Yea, the Saints Conver&s;ation with Chri&s;t in Heaven, &s;hall not only be as intimate, and their Acce&s;s to him as free, as of the Di&s;ciples on Earth&punc; but in many Re&s;pects,

much more &s;o: for in Heaven, that vital Union &s;hall be perfect, which is exceeding imperfect here. While the Saints are in this World, there are great Remains of Sin and Darkne&s;s, to &s;eperate or di&s;unite them from Chri&s;t; which &s;hall then all be removed. This is not a Time for that full Acquaintance, and tho&s;e glorious Manife&s;ta|tions of Love, which Chri&s;t d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;igns for his People here|after; which &s;eems to be &s;ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d by Chri&s;t's Speech to <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> when ready to embrace him, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he met him after his Re&s;urrection&punc; John 20. 17 <HI>Je&s;us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith unto her, touch me not, for I am n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t yet a&s;cended to my Father.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>When the Saints &s;hall &s;ee Chri&s;t's Glory and Exalta|tion in Heaven, it will indeed po&s;&s;e&s;s their Hearts with the greater Admiration and ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing Re&s;pect, but will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into any Separation, but will &s;erve only to heighten their Surprize and Joy, when they find Chri&s;t conde&s;cending to admit them to &s;uch intimate Acce&s;s, and &s;o freely and fully communicating him&s;elf to them&punc;</P>
<P>So that if we choo&s;e Chri&s;t for our Friend and Portion, we &s;hall hereafter be &s;o received to him, that there &s;hall be nothing to hinder the fulle&s;t Enjoyment of him, to the &s;atisfying the utmo&s;t Cravings of our Souls. We may take our full Swing at gratifying our &s;piritual Ap|petite after the&s;e holy Plea&s;ures. Chri&s;t will then &s;ay, as in Cant 5. 1 <HI>Eat. O Friends&punc; Drink, yea drink abun|dantly, O Beloved</HI> And this &s;hall be our Entertainment to all Eternity!

<P N="2">2 By your being united to Chri&s;t, you will have a more glorious Union <HI>with,</HI> and Enjoyment <HI>of, God the Father,</HI> than otherwi&s;e could be.

<HI>God &s;ent forth his</HI> Son, <HI>made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that are under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of</HI> Sons. <HI>And becau&s;e ye are</HI> Sons, <HI>God hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his</HI> Son <HI>into your Hearts, crying</HI> Abba, Father.&mdash;The Church is the Daughter of God, not only as he hath begotten her by his Word and Spirit, but as the is the Spou&s;e of his eter|nal Son.</P>
<P>So we being Members of the Son, are Partakers in our Mea&s;ure, of the Father's Love to the Son, and Compla|cence in him. John 17. 23. <HI>I in them, and thou in me,&mdash;Thou ha&s;t loved them, as thou ha&s;t loved me.</HI> And Ver&s;e 26. <HI>That the Love wherewith thou ha&s;t loved me, may be in them.</HI> And Chap 16. 27. <HI>The Father him&s;elf loveth you, becau&s;e ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</HI> So we &s;hall, according to our Capacities, be Partakers of the Son's Enjoyment of God, and have his Joy fulfilled in our &s;elves, <HI>John</HI> 17. 13. And by this Means, we &s;hall come to an immen&s;ely higher, more intimate, and full Enjoyment of God, than otherwi&s;e could have been.

And Saints being in him, &s;hall, in their Mea|&s;ure and Manner, partake with him in it, and of the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of it.</P>
<P>And thus is the Affair of our Redemption ordered, that thereby we are brought to an immen&s;ely more ex|alted Kind of Union with God, and Enjoyment of him, both the Father and the Son, than otherwi&s;e could have been. For <HI>Chri&s;t being united to the human Nature,</HI> we have Advantage for a more free and full Enjoyment of him, than we could have had if he had remained only in the divine Nature.

<P>This was the De&s;ign of Chri&s;t, to bring it to pa&s;s, that He, and his Father, and his People, might all be united in one.

<P>There were &s;ome u&s;eful Sermons of the Venerable and Aged Mr <HI>William Williams</HI> publi&s;h'd lately in <HI>New-England,</HI> which were Preached in that Part of the Country during this Sea&s;on of the glorious Work of God in the Conver&s;ion of Men; to which Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a mo&s;t judicious and accurate Abridgement of this Epi&s;tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: And a little after, he &s;ent the Original to our Hands, to be communicated to the World under our Care here in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>We are abundantly &s;atisfy'd of the Truth of this Narrative, not only from the pious Character of the Writer, but from the concurrent Te&s;timony of many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">her Per&s;ons in <HI>New England; for this Thing was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in a Corner.</HI> There is a Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Ground, as we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> inform'd, wherein there are twelve or fourteen

Towns and Villages, chiefly &s;ituate in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> near the Banks of the River of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> within the Compa&s;s of Thirty Miles, wherein it plea&s;ed God two Years ago to di&s;play his free and &s;overeign Mercy in the Conver&s;ion of a great Multitude of Souls in a &s;hort Space of Time, turning them from a formal, cold and carele&s;s Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity to the lively Exerci&s;e of every Chri&s;tian Grace, and the powerful Practice of our holy Religion. The great God has &s;eem'd to act over again the Miracle of <HI>Gideon's</HI> Fleece, which was plentifully water'd with the Dew of Heaven, while the re&s;t of the Earth round about it was dry, and had no &s;uch remarkable Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>There has been a great and ju&s;t Complaint for many Years among the Mini&s;ters and Churches in <HI>Old England,</HI> and in <HI>New,</HI> (except about the Time of the late Earth|quake there) that the Work of Conver&s;ion goes on very &s;lowly, that the Spirit of God in his &s;aving Influences is much withdrawn from the Mini&s;trations of his Word, and there are few that receive the Report of the Go&s;pel, with any eminent Succe&s;s upon their Hearts. But as the Go&s;pel is the &s;ame divine In&s;trument of Grace &s;till, as ever it was in the Days of the Apo&s;tles, &s;o our a&s;cended Saviour now and then takes a &s;pecial Occa&s;ion to mani|fe&s;t the Divinity of this Go&s;pel by a plentiful Effu&s;ion of his Spirit where it is preached: then Sinners are turned into Saints in Numbers, and there is a new Face of Things &s;pread over a Town or Country: <HI>The Wil|derne&s;s and the &s;olitary Places are glad, the De&s;ert rejoyces and blo&s;&s;oms as the Ro&s;e;</HI> and &s;urely concerning this In|&s;tance we may add, that <HI>they have &s;een the Glory of the Lord</HI> there, <HI>and the Excellency of our God,</HI> they have <HI>&s;een the Out goings of God our Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g in his Sanctuary.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly it becomes us, who profe&s;s the Religion of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to take Notice of &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing Exerci&s;es of his Power and Mercy, and give him the Glory which is due, when he begins to accompli&s;h any of his Pro|mi&s;es concerning the latter Days: and it gives us fur|ther

Encouragement to pray, and wait, and hope for the like Di&s;play of his Power in the mid&s;t of us. <HI>The Hand of God is not &s;horten'd that it cannot &s;ave,</HI> but we have Rea|&s;on to fear that <HI>our Iniquities,</HI> our Coldne&s;s in Religion, and the general Carnality of our Spirits, have rai&s;ed a Wall of Seperation between God and us: And we may add, the Pride and perver&s;e Humour of Infidelity, De|generacy and Apo&s;tacy from the Chri&s;tian Faith, which have of late Years broken out amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g&s;t us, &s;eem to have provoked the Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to ab&s;ent him&s;elf much from our Nation. <Q>Return, O Lord, and vi&s;it thy Churches, and revive thine own Work in the mid&s;t of us.</Q></P>
<P>From &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed In&s;tances of the Succe&s;s of the Go&s;|pel, as appear in this Narrative, we may learn much of the Way of the Spirit of God in his Dealing with the Souls of Men, in order to Convince Sinners, and re&s;tore them to his Favour and his Image by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> his Son. We acknowledge that &s;ome particular Appearan|ces in the Work of Conver&s;ion among Men may be oc|ca&s;ion'd by the Mini&s;try which they &s;it under, whether it be of a more or le&s;s Evangelical Strain, whether it be more &s;evere and affrighting, or more gentle and Per&s;ua|&s;ive. But where&s;oever God works with Power for Salva|tion upon the Minds of Men, there will be &s;ome Di&s;co|veries of a Sen&s;e of Sin, of the Danger of the Wrath of God, of the All &s;ufficiency of his Son <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elieve us under all our Spiritual Wants and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and a hear|ty Con&s;ent of Soul to receive him in the various Offices of Grace, wherein he is &s;et forth in the holy Scriptures. And if our Readers had Opportunity (as we have had) to peru&s;e &s;everal of the Sermons which were Preached during this glorious Sea&s;on, we &s;hould find that it is the common plain <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Doctrine of the Reformati|on, without &s;tretching towards the <HI>Antinomians</HI> on the one Side, or the <HI>Arminians</HI> on the other, that the Spirit of God has been plea&s;ed to honour with &s;uch illu&s;trious Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>We are taught al&s;o by this happy Event how ea&s;y it will be for our ble&s;&s;ed Lord to make a full Accompli&s;h|ment

of all his Predictions concerning his Kingdom, and to &s;pread his Dominion from Sea to Sea, thro' all the Na|tions of the Earth. We &s;ee how ea&s;y it is for him with one Turn of his Hand, with one Word of his Mouth, to awaken whole Countries of &s;tupid and &s;leeping Sinners, and kindle divine Life in their Souls.

But the Plea&s;ure of this agreeable Hint bears the Mind away from our Theme.</P>
<P>Let us return to the pre&s;ent Narrative. 'Tis worthy of our Ob&s;ervation, that this great and &s;urprizing Work does not &s;eem to have taken i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ri&s;e from any &s;udden and di|&s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ng Calamity or publick Terror that might univer&s;ally impre&s;s the Minds of a People: Here was no Storm, no Earthquake, no Inundation of Water, no De&s;olation by Fire, no Pe&s;tilence or any other &s;weeping Di&s;temper, nor any cruel Inva&s;ion by their <HI>Indian</HI> Neighbours, that might force the Inhabitants into a &s;erious Thoughtfulne&s;s, and a religious Temper by the Fears of approaching Death and Judgment. Such Scenes as the&s;e have &s;ometimes been made happily effectual to awaken <HI>Sinners</HI> in <HI>Zion,</HI> and the formal Profe&s;&s;or and the <HI>Hypocrite</HI> have been terrify'd with the Thoughts of divine Wrath breaking in upon them, <HI>Who &s;hall dwell with everla&s;ting Burrings?</HI> But in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e the immediate Hand of God in the Work of his Spirit appears much more evident, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="v" REF="004239_0299_10042F9AECDFE270">
cau&s;e there is no &s;uch awful and threat'ning Providence attending it.</P>
<P>It is worthy al&s;o of our further Notice, that when many profane Sinners, and formal Profe&s;&s;ors of Religi|on have been affrighted out of their pre&s;ent Carele&s;ne&s;s and Stupidity by &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hing Terrors approaching them, tho&s;e religious Appearances have not been &s;o du|rable, nor the real Change of Heart &s;o thoroughly effected: Many of the&s;e &s;ort of &s;udden Converts have dropt their religious Concerns in a great Mea&s;ure when their Fears of the threat'ning Calamity are vani&s;h'd. But it is a ble&s;&s;ed Confirmation of the Truth of this pre&s;ent Work of Grace, that the Per&s;ons who were divinely wrought upon in this Sea&s;on continue &s;till to profe&s;s &s;erious Religion, and to practice it without returning to their former Follies.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s in this Place to take Notice, that a very &s;urprizing and threat'ning Providence has this la&s;t Year attended the People of <HI>Northampton,</HI> among whom this Work of divine Grace was &s;o remarkable: Which Providence at fir&s;t might have been con&s;trued by the un|thinking World to be a &s;ignal Token of God's Di&s;plea|&s;ure again&s;t that Town, or a Judgment from Heaven upon the People; but &s;oon afterwards, like <HI>Paul's</HI> &s;hak|ing the Viper off from his Hand, it di&s;covered the a|&s;toni&s;hing Care and Goodne&s;s of God expre&s;s'd towards a Place where &s;uch a Multitude of his young Converts were a&s;&s;embled: Nor can we give a better Account of it than in the Language of this very Gentleman, the Revd Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> Mini&s;ter of that Town, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> wrote the follow|ing Letter, which was publi&s;h'd in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHEN the Di&s;ciples of our glorious Lord were filled with Sorrow upon the heavy Tidings of his Departure from them. He chear'd their drooping Spirits with that good Word, John</HI> 16. 7. Neverthele&s;s, I tell you the Truth; it is expedient for you that I go away: For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will &s;end him unto you. <HI>And after his A&s;cen&s;ion, he fulfill'd this great and precious Promi&s;e by the extraordi|nary Effu&s;ion of his Spirit, under who&s;e Conduct and Influence, the</HI> Apo&s;tles went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them: <HI>&s;o that when we read the</HI> Acts of the A|po&s;tles, <HI>we mu&s;t &s;ay;</HI> Not by Might, nor by Power, but by the Spirit of the Lord of Ho&s;ts. <HI>And tho', &s;oon after the fir&s;t Days of Chri&s;tianity, there was a dreadful Apo&s;tacy, yet God did not wholly take his Spirit from his People; but rais'd up faithful Witne&s;&s;es to te&s;tify again&s;t the Here&s;ies and Corruptions of the Times wherein they lived. And &s;ince Antichri&s;t</HI> that wicked One has been reveal'd, <HI>our Lord, according to his Word, has been gradually</HI> con&s;uming him with the Spirit of his Mouth, <HI>in the Reformation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nor have we in the&s;e remote Corners of the Earth, where Satan had his Seat from Time im|memorial, been le&s;t without a Witne&s;s of the divine Power and Grace. Very remarkable was the Work of God's Spirit &s;tirring up our Fore Fathers to leave a plea&s;ant Land, and tran&s;port them&s;elves over a va&s;t Ocean into this then howling Wilderne&s;s; that they might enjoy Communion with Chri&s;t in the Purity of his Ordinances, and leave their Children in the quiet

<P><HI>Yea, we need look no higher than our own Times, to find abundant Occa&s;ion to celebrate the wonderful Works of God. Thus when God aro&s;e and &s;hook the Earth.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>October</HI> 29.

And they remembred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer. Ne|verthele&s;s, they did flatter him with their Mouths, and they lied unto him with their Tongues. <HI>And there has &s;ince been great Rea&s;on to complain of our &s;peedy Return to our former Sins, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome Hopes given of a more general Reformation. Yea when more lately, it plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it many of our</HI> Towns <HI>with a</HI> very mortal Di&s;temper, <HI>to that Time in a Manner unknown; whereby great Numbers of our hopeful Children and Youth have been cut off, many very &s;uddenly, and with Circum|&s;tances exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and awful: Yet ala&s;s! We have not generally &s;een, nor duly con&s;idered God's Hand &s;tretched out again&s;t us; but have given him Rea&s;on to complain, as of his ancient People,</HI> Why &s;hould ye be Stricken any more, ye will revolt more and more <HI>And accordingly His Anger is not turned away; but his Hand is &s;tretched out &s;till.

A plain Proof of this awful Truth, that the mo&s;t awakening Di&s;pen&s;ations can no farther humble and do us good, than as it plea&s;eth God to accompany them with his Spirit, and &s;o command his Ble&s;&s;ing upon them. But when the Almighty will work by &s;uch Means, or with u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> them, who can hinder him? He acts with &s;overeign Liberty and irre&s;i&s;ti|ble Power. John 3. 8.</HI> The Wind bloweth where it lifteth, and thou heare&s;t the Sound thereof, but can&s;t not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: &s;o is every one that is born of the Spirit. <HI>Such was his wonderful Work at</HI> Northampton, and the neighbouring Towns in the County of Hamp|&s;hire, <HI>and &s;ome other Places. The Holy Spirit was in a plentiful and extraordinary Manner pour'd out on Per&s;ons of every Age and Condition, without &s;uch remarkable Providences going before to awaken them; as the</HI> Dew falls in the Night, <HI>and yet the Effects appear'd as the</HI> Light which goeth forth. <HI>So that we might well admiring &s;ay,</HI> What has God wrought! <HI>Great was the Number of them who publi&s;h'd the Wonders of the Divine Power &amp; Grace; declaring with Humility, what God had done for their Souls. And others who went among them, ac|knowleg'd that the Work exceeded the Fame of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now the p&s;almi&s;t ob&s;erves that</HI> God has made his wonderful Works to be remembred. <HI>We therefore apprehend that our Reverend Brother has done well to record and publi&s;h this &s;urprizing Work of God; and the Fidelity of his Account would not have been at all doubted of by us, tho' there had not been the concurrent Te&s;timony of Others to it. It is al&s;o a Plea&s;ure to us to hear what Acceptance the follow|ing Narrative has found in the other</HI> England, <HI>where it has had two Impre&s;&s;ions already, and been honour'd with a recommendatory Preface, by two Divines of eminent Note in</HI> London, <HI>viz.  the Rev.

<P>HAVING &s;een your <HI>Letter</HI> to my honoured Uncle <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield</HI> of <HI>July 20,</HI> wherein you inform him of the <HI>Notice</HI> that has been taken of the late <HI>wonderful Work of God,</HI> in this, and &s;ome other Towns in this <HI>County;</HI> by the Rev. Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> and Dr. <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and the Congregation to which the la&s;t of the&s;e preached on a monthly Day of &s;olemn Prayer; as al&s;o, of your de&s;ire to be more perfectly ac|quainted with it, by &s;ome of us on the &s;pot: and having
<PB N="2" REF="004239_0310_10042FC282E79F30">
been &s;ince informed by my Uncle <HI>Williams,</HI> that you de&s;ire me to undertake it; I would now do it, in as <HI>ju&s;t and faithful a Manner</HI> as in me lies.</P>
<P>The People of the <HI>County,</HI> in general, I &s;uppo&s;e, are as <HI>&s;ober,</HI> and <HI>orderly,</HI> and good &s;ort of People, as in any Part of <HI>New|England;</HI> and I believe they have been pre&s;erved the free&s;t by far, of any Part of the Country, from <HI>Error,</HI> and variety of <HI>Sects</HI> and Opinions. Our being &s;o far <HI>within</HI> the Land, at a di&s;tance from <HI>Sea-ports,</HI> and in a Corner of the Country, has doubtle&s;s been one <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> why we have not been &s;o much corrupted with <HI>Vice,</HI> as mo&s;t other Parts. But without que&s;|tion, the <HI>Religion,</HI> and good Order of the <HI>County,</HI> and their Purity in <HI>Doctrine,</HI> has, under God, been very much owing to the great Abilities, and eminent Piety, of my venerable and honoured Grandfather <HI>Stoddard.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e we have been the free&s;t of any Part of the Land from unhappy <HI>Divi&s;|ion,</HI> and <HI>Quarrels</HI> in our accle&s;ia&s;tical and religious Affairs, till the late lamentable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Springfield</HI> Contention relates to the Settlement of a Mini&s;ter there, which occa&s;ion'd too warm Debates between &s;ome, both Pa&s;tors and People, that were for it, and others that were again&s;t it, on account of their different Apprehen&s;ions about his Principles, and about &s;ome Steps that were taken to procure his Ordination.</NOTE> <HI>Springfield Contention.</HI></P>
<P>We being much &s;eparated from other Parts of the Pro|vince, and having comparatively but little Intercour&s;e with them, have from the beginning, till now, always managed our eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs within our &s;elves: 'tis the way in which the County, from its Infancy, has gone on, by the practical Agreement of all, and the way in which our Peace and good Order has hither to been maintained.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Northampton</HI> is of about 82 <HI>Years</HI> &s;tanding, and has now about 200 <HI>Families;</HI> which mo&s;tly dwell more <HI>compactly</HI> together than any Town of &s;uch a Bigne&s;s in the&s;e Parts of the Country; which probably has been an Occa&s;ion that both our <HI>Corruptions,</HI> and <HI>Reformations</HI> have been, from
<PB N="3" REF="004239_0311_10042FC8CC7F18C0">
time to time, the more <HI>&s;wiftly</HI> propagated, from one to another, through the Town. Take the <HI>Town</HI> is general, and &s;o far as I can judge, they are as <HI>Rational</HI> and <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> a Peo|ple as mo&s;t I have been acquainted with: Many of them have been <HI>noted</HI> for Religion, and particularly, have been re|markable for their di&s;tinct <HI>Knowledge</HI> in things that relate to <HI>Heart</HI> Religion, and Chri&s;tian <HI>Experience,</HI> and their great <HI>Regards</HI> thereto.</P>
<P>I am the <HI>third Mini&s;ter</HI> that has been &s;ettled in the Town: the Rev. Mr. <HI>Eleazer Mather,</HI> who was the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> was ordain|ed in <HI>July,</HI> 1669. He was one who&s;e Heart was <HI>much</HI> in his Work, abundant in <HI>Labours</HI> for the good of precious Souls; he had the high E&s;teem and great Love of his Peo|ple, and was ble&s;&s;ed with no &s;mall <HI>Succe&s;s.</HI> The Rev. Mr. <HI>Stoddard,</HI> who &s;ucceeded him, came fir&s;t to the Town the <HI>November</HI> after his Death, but was not ordained till <HI>September</HI> 11. 1672, and died <HI>Feb.</HI> 11. 1728. 9. So that he continued in the Work of the Mini&s;try here, from his fir&s;t coming to Town, near 60 Years. And as he was eminent and <HI>renown|ed</HI> for his Gifts and Grace; &s;o he was ble&s;&s;ed, from the be|ginning, with <HI>extraordinary Succe&s;s</HI> in his Mini&s;try, in the Conver&s;ion of many Souls. He had <HI>five Harve&s;ts,</HI> as he call|ed them: The <HI>first</HI> was about 57 Years ago; the <HI>&s;econd</HI> a|bout 53 Years; the <HI>third</HI> about 40; the <HI>fourth</HI> about 24; the <HI>fifth</HI> and la&s;t about 18 Years ago. <HI>Some</HI> of the&s;e Times were much more remarkable than others, and the ingathering of Souls more plentiful. Tho&s;e that were about 53, and 40, and 24 Years ago, were much greater than either the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or the <HI>la&s;t:</HI> but in <HI>each</HI> of them, I have heard my <HI>Grandfather</HI> &s;ay, the <HI>bigger</HI> Part of the <HI>young</HI> People in the Town, &s;eemed to be mainly concerned for their eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>After the <HI>la&s;t</HI> of the&s;e came a far more degenerate time, (at lea&s;t among the young People) I &s;uppo&s;e, than ever before. Mr. <HI>Stoddard,</HI> indeed, had the Comfort before he died, of &s;eeing a time where there were no &s;mall Appearences of a divine Work among&s;t &s;ome, and a con&s;iderable <HI>Ingathering</HI> of Souls, even after I was &s;ettled with him in the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> which was about <HI>two</HI> Years before his Death; and I have rea&s;on to <HI>ble&s;s</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="004239_0312_10042F8D2E4AFF78">
God for the great Advantage I had by it. In the&s;e <HI>two</HI> Years there were near <HI>twenty</HI> that Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI> hoped to be &s;avingly converted; but there was nothing of any <HI>General Awakening.</HI> The greater Part &s;eemed to be at that time very in&s;en&s;ible of the things of Religi|on, and engaged in other Cares and Pur&s;uits. Ju&s;t after my Grandfather's Death, it &s;eemed to be a time of ex|traordinary <HI>Dulne&s;s</HI> in Religion: <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> for &s;ome Years greatly prevailed among the <HI>Youth</HI> of the Town; they were many of them very much addicted to <HI>Night-walking,</HI> and frequenting the <HI>Tavern,</HI> and <HI>lend</HI> Practices, wherein &s;ome, by their Example exceedingly corrupted others. It was their Manner very frequently to get together, in Conventions of both <HI>Sexes,</HI> for Mirth and Jollity, which they called <HI>Frolicks;</HI> and they would often &s;pend the greater part of the <HI>Night</HI> in them, with|out regard to any <HI>Order</HI> in the Families they belonged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o: and indeed <HI>Family-Government</HI> did too much fail in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Town. It was become very cu&s;tomary with many of our young People, to be <HI>Indecent</HI> in their Carriage at <HI>Meeting,</HI> which doubtle&s;s, would not have prevailed to &s;uch a degree, had it not been that my <HI>Grandfather,</HI> through his <HI>great Age,</HI> (tho' he retained his <HI>Powers</HI> &s;urprizingly to the <HI>la&s;t</HI>) was not &s;o able to <HI>Ob&s;erve</HI> them. There had al&s;o long prevailed in the Town, a Spirit of Contention between <HI>two Parties,</HI> into which they had for many Years been <HI>divided,</HI> by which, was maintain'd a <HI>Jealou&s;y</HI> one of the other, and they were prepared to <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> one another in all publick Affairs.</P>
<P>But in <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> Years after Mr. <HI>Stoddard'</HI>s Death, there began to be a &s;en&s;ible Amendment of the&s;e Evils; the <HI>young People</HI> &s;hew'd more of a Di&s;po&s;ition to hear|ken to Coun&s;el, and by degrees left off their <HI>Frolicking,</HI> and grew ob&s;ervably more <HI>Decent</HI> in their Attendance on the publick Wor&s;hip, and there were more that manife&s;ted a <HI>Religious Concern</HI> than there u&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>At the latter end of the Year 1733. there appeared a very unu&s;ual flexiblene&s;s, and yielding to Advice, in our young People. It had been too long their manner
<PB N="5" REF="004239_0313_10042FCBD8F76738">
to make the <HI>Evening after the Sabbath</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be noted, that it has never been our Manner, to ob&s;erve the <HI>Evening</HI> that <HI>follows</HI> the Sabbath; but that which <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">edes</HI> it, as part of holy Time.</NOTE> and after our publick <HI>Lecture,</HI> to be e&s;pecially the Times of their <HI>Mirth,</HI> and Company keeping. But a <HI>Sermon</HI> was now preached on the Sabbath before the <HI>Lecture,</HI> to &s;hew the <HI>Evil Tendency</HI> of the Practice, and to per&s;uade them to reform it; and it was urged on <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Families,</HI> that it &s;hould be a thing <HI>agreed</HI> upon among them to govern their Families, and keep their Children at home, at the&s;e times; and withal it was more <HI>privately</HI> moved, that they &s;hould meet together, the next Day, in their &s;everal Neighbourhoods, to know each other's Minds: which was accordingly done, and the <HI>Motion</HI> complied with throughout the Town. But <HI>Parents</HI> found little, or no occa&s;ion for the exerci&s;e of Government in the Ca&s;e: the <HI>young People</HI> declared them&s;elves <HI>convinced</HI> by what they had heard from the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> and were willing of them&s;elves to comply with t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Coun&s;el that had been given: and it was <HI>immediately,</HI> and, I &s;up|po&s;e, almo&s;t <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> complied with; and there was a thorough <HI>Reformation</HI> of the&s;e Di&s;orders thenceforward, which has continued ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after this, there began to appear a <HI>remarkable Religious Concern</HI> at a little <HI>Village,</HI> belonging to the Congregation, Call'd <HI>Pa&s;commuck,</HI> where a few Families were &s;ettled, at about <HI>three Miles</HI> di&s;tance from the main Body of the Town. At this place, a number of Per|&s;ons &s;eemed to be &s;avingly wrought upon. In the <HI>April</HI> following, <HI>Anno</HI> 1734, there happen'd a very <HI>&s;udden and awful Death of a young Man,</HI> in the Bloom of his Youth; who being violently &s;eized with a <HI>Pleuri&s;y,</HI> and taken immediately very <HI>delirious,</HI> died in about <HI>two Days;</HI> which (together with what was preached pub|lickly on that Occa&s;ion) much <HI>affected</HI> many young People. This was followed with another Death of a
<PB N="6" REF="004239_0314_10042FCEAC1AFC30">
young married <HI>Woman,</HI> who had been con&s;iderably <HI>exerci&s;ed</HI> in Mind, about the Salvation of her <HI>Soul,</HI> be|fore &s;he was ill, and was in great <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> in the be|ginning of her Illne&s;s; but &s;eemed to have <HI>&s;atisfying Evidences</HI> of God's &s;aving <HI>Mercy</HI> to her, before her Death; &s;o that &s;he died very full of <HI>Comfort,</HI> in a mo&s;t earne&s;t and moving Manner <HI>warning,</HI> and coun&s;elling others. This &s;eem'd much to <HI>contribute</HI> to the &s;olemni|zing of the Spirits of many young Per&s;ons: and there began evidently to appear more of a <HI>Religious Concern</HI> on People's Minds.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Fall</HI> of the Year, I propo&s;ed it to the <HI>young People,</HI> that they &s;hould agree among them&s;elves to &s;pend the <HI>Evenings after Lectures</HI> in <HI>&s;ocial</HI> Religion, and to that end divide them&s;elves into &s;everal Companies to meet in various parts of the Town; which was ac|corgingly done, and tho&s;e <HI>Meetings</HI> have been &s;ince continued, and the <HI>Example</HI> imitated by <HI>elder</HI> People. This was follow'd with the Death of an <HI>elderly</HI> Per&s;on, which was attended with many <HI>unu&s;ual</HI> Circum&s;tances, by which many were much moved and affected.</P>
<P>About this time, began the great <HI>Noi&s;e</HI> that was in this Part of the Country, about <HI>Arminiani&s;m,</HI> which &s;eemed to appear with a very <HI>threatning</HI> A&s;pect upon the Intere&s;t of Religion here. The Friends of vital Piety trembled for fear of the I&s;&s;ue; but it &s;eemed, contrary to their Fear, &s;trongly to be <HI>over-ruled</HI> for the promoting of Religion. Many who looked on them|&s;elve as in a <HI>Chri&s;tle&s;s</HI> Condition, &s;eemed to be awaken'd by it, with fear that God was about to withdraw from the Land, and that we &s;hould be given up to <HI>Heterodoxy,</HI> and corrupt Principles; and that then their <HI>Opportunity</HI> for obtaining Salvation would be pa&s;t; and many who were brought a little to <HI>doubt</HI> about the <HI>Truth</HI> of the <HI>Doctrines</HI> they had hitherto been taught, &s;eem'd to have a kind of a trembling <HI>Fear</HI> with their Doubts, le&s;t they &s;hould be led into <HI>By-paths,</HI> to their eternal undoing: And they &s;eem'd with much Concern and Engagedne&s;s of Mind, to enquire what was indeed the Way in which they mu&s;t come to be accepted with God.
<PB N="7" REF="004239_0315_10040530F7BC4B98">
There were then &s;ome things &s;aid <HI>publickly</HI> on that Oc|ca&s;ion, concerning <HI>Ju&s;tification by Faith alone.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' great <HI>Fault</HI> was found with <HI>meddling</HI> with the <HI>Controver&s;y</HI> in the Pulpit, by &s;uch a Per&s;on, and at that time, and tho' it was ridiculed by many <HI>el&s;ewhere;</HI> yet it proved a Word &s;poken in &s;ea&s;on here; and was mo&s;t evidently attended with a very remarkable <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of Heaven to the Souls of the People in this Town. They received thence a general &s;atisfaction with re&s;pect to the main thing in que&s;tion, which they had been in trembling doubts and concern about; and their Minds were engag'd the more earne&s;tly to &s;eek that they might come to be accepted of God, and &s;aved in the Way of the Go&s;pel, which had been made evident to them to be the true and only Way. And <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> it was, in the latter part of <HI>December, that the Spirit of God</HI> began extraordinarily to &s;et in, and <HI>wonderfully</HI> to work among&s;t us; and there were, very <HI>&s;uddenly,</HI> one after another, five or &s;ix Per&s;ons, who were to all appear|ance &s;avingly converted, and &s;ome of them wrought upon in a very remarkable manner.</P>
<P>Particularly, I was &s;urprized with the relation of a <HI>young Woman,</HI> who had been one of the greate&s;t Company-Keepers in the whole Town: When &s;he came to me, I had never heard that &s;he was become in any wi&s;e &s;erious, but by the Conver&s;ation I then had with her, it appeared to me, that what &s;he gave an account of, was a glorious Work of God's infinite Power and &s;overeign Grace; and that God had given her a <HI>new</HI> Heart, truly broken and &s;anctified. I could not then doubt of it, and have &s;een much in my Ac|quaintance with her &s;ince to confirm in.</P>
<P>Tho' the Work was <HI>glorious,</HI> yet I was filled with concern about the <HI>Effect</HI> it might have upon others: I was ready to conclude (tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oo ra&s;hly) that &s;ome would be <HI>harden'd</HI> by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, in carele&s;sne&s;s and loo&s;ene&s;s of Life; and would take occa&s;ion from it to open their Mouths, in <HI>Reproaches</HI> of Religion. But the <HI>Even<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> was the <HI>Rever&s;e,</HI> to a wonderful degree; God made it, I &s;uppo&s;e, the <HI>greate&s;t occa&s;ion of awakening</HI> to others, of
<PB N="8" REF="004239_0316_10042FD3CEB66350">
any thing that ever came to pa&s;s in the Town. I have had abundant Opportunity to know the Effect it had, by my private Conver&s;ation with many. The news of it &s;eemed to be almo&s;t like a <HI>fla&s;h of Lightning,</HI> upon the Hearts of young People, all over the Town, and upon many others. Tho&s;e Per&s;ons among&s;t us, who u&s;ed to be <HI>farthe&s;t</HI> from &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and that I mo&s;t feared would make an ill Improvement of it, &s;eemed greatly to be <HI>awakened</HI> with it; many went to talk with her, concerning what &s;he had met with; and what appeared in her &s;eemed to be to the Satisfaction of all that did &s;o.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently upon this, a great and earne&s;t Concern about the great things of Religion, and the eternal World, became <HI>univer&s;al</HI> in all parts of the Town, and among Per&s;ons of all Degrees, and all Ages; the Noi&s;e among&s;t the <HI>Dry Bones</HI> waxed louder and louder: All other talk but about &s;piritual and eternal things, was &s;oon thrown by; all the Conver&s;ation in all Companies, and upon all occa&s;ions, was upon the&s;e things only, un|le&s;s &s;o much as was nece&s;&s;ary for People, carrying on their ordinary &s;ecular Bu&s;ine&s;s. Other Di&s;cour&s;e than of the things of Religion, would &s;carcely be tolerated in any Company. The Minds of People were wonderfully taken off from the <HI>World,</HI> it was treated among&s;t us as a thing of very little Con&s;equence: They &s;eem'd to follow their worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s, more as a part of their Duty, than from any Di&s;po&s;ition they had to it; the <HI>Temptation</HI> now &s;eemed to lie on that hand, to <HI>neglect</HI> worldly Affairs too much, and to &s;pend too much Time in the immediate Exerci&s;e of Religion: Which Thing was exceedingly mi&s;repre&s;ented by Reports that were &s;pread in di&s;tant Parts of the Land, as tho' the People here had wholly thrown by all worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s, and be|took them&s;elves entirely to Reading, and Praying, and &s;uch like religious Exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>But altho' People did not ordinarily neglect their worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s; yet there then was the Rever&s;e of what commonly is: <HI>Religion</HI> was with all &s;orts the great Con|cern, and the <HI>World</HI> was a thing only by the Bye. The
<PB N="9" REF="004239_0317_10042FD5541EE100">
only Thing in their view was to get the Kingdom of Heaven, and every one appeared pre&s;&s;ing into it: The Engagedne&s;s of their Hearts in this great Concern cou'd not <HI>be hid,</HI> it appear'd in their very <HI>Countenances.</HI> It then was a dreadful Thing among&s;t us to lie out of Chri&s;t, in danger every day of dropping into Hell; and what Per&s;ons minds were intent upon was to <HI>e&s;cape for their Lives,</HI> and to <HI>fly from the Wrath to come.</HI> All would eagerly lay hold of Opportunities for their Souls; and were wont very often to meet together in private Hou&s;es, for religious Purpo&s;es: And &s;uch Meetings when appointed were wont greatly to be thronged.</P>
<P>There was &s;carcely a &s;ingle Per&s;on in the Town, either old or young, that was left unconcerned about the great Things of the eternal World. Tho&s;e that were wont to be the vaine&s;t, and loo&s;e&s;t, and tho&s;e that had been mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to think, and &s;peak &s;light|ly of vital and experimental Religion, were now generally &s;ubject to great awakenings. And the Work of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> was carried on in a mo&s;t <HI>a&s;toni&s;hing</HI> man|ner, and increa&s;ed more and more; Souls did as it were come by Flocks to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. From Day to Day, for many Months together, might be &s;een evident In&s;tances of Sinners brought <HI>out of Darkne&s;s into marvel|lous Light,</HI> and delivered <HI>out of an horrible Pit, and from the miry Clay, and &s;et upon a Rock,</HI> with a <HI>new Song of Prai&s;e to God in their mouths.</HI></P>
<P>This Work of God, as it was carried on, and the Number of true Saints multiplied, &s;oon made a glori|ous Alteration in the Town; &s;o that in the Spring and Summer following, <HI>Anno</HI> 173<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. the Town &s;eemed to be full of the Per&s;ence of God: It never was &s;o full of <HI>Love,</HI> nor &s;o full of <HI>Joy;</HI> and yet &s;o full of Di&s;tre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was then. There were remarkable Tokens of God's Pre&s;ence in almo&s;t every Hou&s;e. It was a time of Joy in <HI>Families</HI> on the account of Salvation's being b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought unto them; <HI>Parents</HI> rejoicing over their Chil|dren as new born, and <HI>Husbands</HI> over their Wives, and <HI>Wives</HI> over their Husbands. <HI>The goings of God</HI> were then <HI>&s;een in his Sanctuary,</HI> God's <HI>Day</HI> was <HI>a delight,</HI> and
<PB N="10" REF="004239_0318_10042FD808D30880">
his <HI>Tabernacles</HI> were <HI>amiable.</HI> Our publick <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI> were then beautiful; the Congregation was <HI>alive</HI> in God's Service, every one earne&s;tly intent on the Pub|lick Wor&s;hip, every <HI>Hearer</HI> eager to drink in the Words of the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> as they came from his Mouth; the A&s;&s;embly in general were from time to time, <HI>in Tears</HI> while the Word was preached; <HI>&s;ome</HI> weeping with Sorrow and Di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>others</HI> with Joy and Love, <HI>others</HI> with Pity and Concern for the Souls of their Neigh|bours.</P>
<P>Our publick <HI>Prai&s;es</HI> were then greatly; enliven'd; God was then &s;erved in our <HI>P&s;almody,</HI> in &s;ome mea&s;ure, in the <HI>Beauty of Holine&s;s.</HI> It has been ob&s;ervable, that there has been &s;carce <HI>any part</HI> of Divine Wor&s;hip, wherein good Men among&s;t us have had <HI>Grace &s;o drawn forth,</HI> and their Hearts <HI>&s;o lifted up</HI> in the Ways of God, as <HI>in &s;inging</HI> his Prai&s;es: Our Congregation excell'd all that ever I knew in the <HI>external</HI> Part of the Duty before, generally carrying regularly, and well, <HI>three Parts of Mu&s;ick,</HI> and the <HI>Women</HI> a Part by them&s;elves: But now they were evidently wont to &s;ing with <HI>unu&s;ual Ele|vation</HI> of Heart and Voice, which made the Duty plea&s;ant indeed.</P>
<P>In all <HI>Companies</HI> on <HI>other</HI> Days, on whatever <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> Per&s;ons met together, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was to be heard of and &s;een in the mid&s;t of them. Our <HI>young People,</HI> when they met, were wont to &s;pend the Time in talking of the <HI>Excellency</HI> and dying <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> the Gloriou&s;ne&s;s of the way of <HI>Salvation,</HI> the wonderful, free, and &s;overeign <HI>Grace</HI> of God, his glorious Work in the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of a Soul, the <HI>Truth</HI> and Certainty of the great Things of God's Word, the Sweetne&s;s of the Views of his <HI>Perfections, &amp;c.</HI> And even at <HI>Weddings,</HI> which formerly were meerly occa&s;ions of Mirth and Jollity, there was now no di&s;cour&s;e of any thing but the things of Religion, and no appearance of any, but <HI>&s;piritual Mirth.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e among&s;t us that had been <HI>formerly converted,</HI> were greatly enliven'd and renew'd with fre&s;h and ex|traordinary Incomes of the Spirit of God; tho' &s;ome

much more than others, <HI>according to the mea&s;ure of the Gift of Chri&s;t:</HI> Many that before had laboured under <HI>Difficulties</HI> about their own State, had now their <HI>Doubts</HI> removed by more &s;atisfying Experience, and more clear Di&s;coveries of God's Love.</P>
<P>When this Work of God fir&s;t appeared, and was &s;o extraordinarily carried on among&s;t <HI>us</HI> in the Winter, <HI>others</HI> round about us, &s;eemed not to know <HI>what</HI> to make of it; and there were many that &s;coffed at and ridiculed it; and &s;ome compared what we called Con|ver&s;ion, to certain <HI>Di&s;tempers.</HI> But it was very ob&s;ervable of many, that occa&s;ionally came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mong&s;t us from a|broad, with di&s;regardful Hearts, that what they <HI>&s;aw</HI> here <HI>cured</HI> them of &s;uch a Temper of Mind: <HI>Strangers</HI> were generally &s;urprized to find Things &s;o much <HI>be|yond</HI> what they had heard, and were wont to tell others that the State of the Town could not be conceiv'd of by tho&s;e that had not &s;een it. The Notice that was taken of it by the People that came to Town on occa&s;ion of the <HI>Court,</HI> that &s;at here in the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> was very ob&s;ervable. And tho&s;e that came from the Neighbourhood to our publick <HI>Lectures,</HI> were for the mo&s;t part remarkably affected. Many that came to Town, on one occa&s;ion or other, had their Con|&s;ciences &s;mitten, and awaken'd, and went home with wounded Hearts, and with tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions that never wore off till they had hopefully a &s;aving I&s;&s;ue; and tho&s;e that before had &s;erious Thoughts, had their A|wakenings and Convictions greatly increa&s;ed. And there were many In&s;tances of Per&s;ons that came from abroad, on Vi&s;its, or on Bu&s;ine&s;s, that had not been long here before to all Appearance they were &s;avingly wrought upon, and partook of that Shower of divine Ble&s;&s;ing that God rained down here, and went home Rejoyc|ing; 'till at length the <HI>&s;ame Work</HI> began evidently to appear and prevail in &s;everal other Towns in the <HI>County.</HI></P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>March,</HI> the People in <HI>South-Hadley</HI> began to be &s;eized with deep Concern about the Things of Religion; which very &s;oon became univer&s;al:
<PB N="12" REF="004239_0320_10042FDF2A47F598">
And the Work of God has been very wonderful <HI>there;</HI> not much, if any thing, &s;hort of what it has been here, in proportion to the bigne&s;s of the Place. About the &s;ame Time, it began to break forth in the We&s;t part of <HI>Suffield,</HI> (where it has al&s;o been very great,) and it &s;oon &s;pread into all parts of the Town. It next appear'd at <HI>Sunderland,</HI> and &s;oon over&s;pread the Town; and I believe was, for a Sea&s;on, not le&s;s remarkable than it was here. About the &s;ame time, it began to appear in a part of <HI>Deerfield,</HI> called <HI>Green-River,</HI> and after|wards fill'd the Town, and there has been a <HI>glorious</HI> Work there: It began al&s;o to be manife&s;t, in the South part of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> in a place called the <HI>Hill,</HI> and after that the <HI>whole Town,</HI> in the &s;econd Week in <HI>April,</HI> &s;eemed to be &s;eized, as it were at once, with Con|cern about the Things of Religion; and the Work of God has been <HI>great</HI> there. There has been al&s;o a very general Awakening at <HI>We&s;t Springfield,</HI> and <HI>Long-Meadow;</HI> and in <HI>Enfield,</HI> there was for a time no &s;mall Concern among&s;t &s;ome that before had been very loo&s;e Per&s;ons. About the &s;ame time that this appear'd at <HI>Enfield,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll</HI> of <HI>We&s;tfield</HI> informed me, that there had been a great Alteration there, and that more had been done in <HI>one Week</HI> there than in <HI>&s;even Years</HI> before. Some|thing of this Work like wi&s;e appeared in the fir&s;t Precinct in <HI>Springfield,</HI> principally in the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> Extremes of the <HI>Pari&s;h.</HI> And in <HI>Hadley</HI> old Town, there gradual|ly appear'd &s;o much of a Work of God on Souls, as at another time would have been thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orthy of much Notice. For a <HI>&s;hort</HI> time there was al&s;o a very great and general Concern, of the like nature, at <HI>North|field.</HI> And wherever this Concern appeared, it &s;eemed not to be <HI>in vain:</HI> But in every P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ace God brought &s;aving Ble&s;&s;ings with him, and <HI>his</HI> Word attended with his <HI>Spirit</HI> (as we have all rea&s;on to think) return'd <HI>not void.</HI> It might well be &s;aid at that time in all Parts of the County, <HI>Who are the&s;e that fly as a Cloud, and as Doves to their Windows?</HI></P>
<P>As what <HI>other</HI> Towns heard of and found in this, was a great means of awakening <HI>them;</HI> &s;o <HI>our</HI> hearing

of &s;uch a &s;wift, and extraordinary Propagation, and Ex|tent of this Work, did doubtle&s;s for a time &s;erve to up|hold the Work among&s;t us. The continual News kept alive the talk of Religion, and did greatly quicken and rejoice the Hearts of God's People, and much a|waken'd tho&s;e that looked on them&s;elves as &s;till <HI>left be|hind,</HI> and made them the more earne&s;t that they al&s;o might <HI>&s;hare</HI> in the great Ble&s;&s;ing that others had ob|tain'd.</P>
<P>This remarkable <HI>pouring out of the Spirit of God,</HI> which thus extended from one end to the other of this <HI>County,</HI> was not confin'd to it, but many Places in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> have partook in the &s;ame Mercy: As for in&s;tance, the <HI>fir&s;t Pari&s;h in Wind&s;or,</HI> under the pa&s;toral Care of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Mar&s;h</HI> was thus ble&s;t about the &s;ame time, as we in <HI>Northampton,</HI> while we had <HI>no Knowledge</HI> of each other's Circum&s;tances: There has been a very great Ingathering of Souls to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in that Place, and &s;omething Con&s;ide|rable of the &s;ame Work began after wards, in <HI>Ea&s;t Wind&s;or,</HI> my honoured <HI>Father's</HI> Pari&s;h, which has <HI>in times pa&s;t,</HI> been a Place favoured with Mercies of this nature, <HI>above any</HI> on this we&s;tern &s;ide of <HI>New England,</HI> excepting <HI>Northampton;</HI> there having been <HI>four or five</HI> Sea&s;ons of the <HI>pouring out of the Spirit</HI> to the <HI>general</HI> awakening of the People there, &s;ince my <HI>Father's</HI> Settlement among&s;t them</P>
<P>There was al&s;o the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Spring and Summer a wonder|ful Work of God carried on at <HI>Coventry</HI> under the Mini&s;try of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Meacham:</HI> I had opportunity to conver&s;e with &s;ome of <HI>Coventry</HI> People, who gave me a very remarkable Account of the &s;urprizing <HI>Change</HI> that appear'd in the mo&s;t rude and vicious Per&s;ons there. The like was al&s;o very great at the &s;ame time in a Part of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> called the <HI>Crank,</HI> where the Rev. Mr. <HI>Wheelock,</HI> a young Gentleman is lately &s;ettled: And there has been much of the &s;ame at <HI>Durham,</HI> under the Mini&s;try of the Rev.

where the Work was much promoted by the remarkable Conver&s;ion of a young <HI>Woman</HI> that had been a great Company-Keeper, as it was here.</P>
<P>Something of this Work appeared in &s;everal other <HI>Towns</HI> in tho&s;e Parts, as I was informed when I was there, the la&s;t <HI>Fall.</HI> And we have &s;ince been acquaint|ed with &s;omething very remarkable of this nature at another Pari&s;h in <HI>Stratford</HI> call'd <HI>Ripton,</HI> under the pa&s;toral Care of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Mills.</HI> And there was a con&s;iderable Revival of Religion la&s;t Summer at <HI>New|Haven</HI> old Town, as I was once and again informed by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Noyes</HI> the Mini&s;ter there, and by others: And by a Letter which I very lately receiv'd from Mr <HI>Noyes,</HI> and al&s;o by Information we have had otherwi&s;e, this flouri&s;hing of Religion &s;till continues, and has lately much increa&s;ed: Mr. <HI>Noyes</HI> writes, that <HI>many this Sum|mer have been added to the Church,</HI> and particularly mentions &s;everal young Per&s;ons that belong to the prin|cipal Families of that Town.</P>
<P>There has been a degree of the &s;ame Work at a Part of <HI>Guilford;</HI> and very con&s;iderable at <HI>Mansfield,</HI> un|der the Mini&s;try of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Eleazer Williams;</HI> and an unu&s;ual religious Concern at <HI>Tolland;</HI> and &s;omething of it at <HI>Hebron,</HI> and <HI>Bolton.</HI> There was al&s;o no &s;mall Effu&s;ion of the Spirit of God in the North Pari&s;h in <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> in the ea&s;tern Part of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> which I was informed of, and &s;aw &s;omething of it, when I was the la&s;t <HI>Autumn</HI> at the Hou&s;e, and in the Congregation of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Lord,</HI> the Mini&s;ter there; who, with the Rev.

of the &s;ame Work among&s;t them, which prevail|ed till there was a <HI>general</HI> Awakening, and many In|&s;tances of Per&s;ons, who &s;eemed to be remarkably con|verted. I al&s;o have lately heard that there has been &s;omething of the &s;ame Work at <HI>Woodbury.</HI></P>
<P>But this Shower of divine Ble&s;&s;ing has been yet more <HI>exten&s;ive:</HI> There was no &s;mall Degree of it in &s;ome parts of the <HI>Jer&s;eys;</HI> as I was informed when I was at <HI>New|York,</HI> (in a long Journey I took at that time of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Year for my Health,) by &s;ome People of the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> whom I &s;aw: E&s;pecially the Rev.

<P>This &s;eems to have been a very <HI>extraordinary</HI> Di&s;|pen&s;ation of Providence: God has in many Re&s;pects gone out of, and much beyond his u&s;ual, and <HI>ordinary Way.</HI> The Work in this Town, and &s;ome others a|bout us, has been extraordinary on account of the <HI>Univer&s;ality</HI> of it, affecting all &s;orts, &s;ober and vicious, high and low, rich and poor, wi&s;e and unwi&s;e; it reach'd the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Families and Per&s;ons, to all ap|pearance, as much as others. In former &s;tirrings of this nature, the Bulk of the <HI>young</HI> People have been greatly affected; but <HI>old Men,</HI> and <HI>little Children</HI> have been &s;o now. Many of the <HI>la&s;t</HI> have, of their own accord, formed them&s;elves into <HI>religious Societies,</HI> in different Parts of the Town: A loo&s;e carele&s;s Per&s;on could &s;carcely find a Companion in the whole Neigh|bourhood; and if there was <HI>any one</HI> that &s;eemed to remain &s;en&s;ele&s;s or unconcerned, it would be &s;poken of as a <HI>&s;trange</HI> Thing.</P>
<P>This Di&s;pen&s;ation has al&s;o appeared very extraordinary in the <HI>Numbers</HI> of tho&s;e, on whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e have rea&s;on to

hope it has had a &s;aving Effect: We have about &s;ix hundred and twenty <HI>Communicants,</HI> which include almo&s;t all our adult Per&s;ons. The Church was very <HI>large</HI> be|fore; but Per&s;ons never <HI>thronged</HI> into it, as they did in the late extraordinary Time:&mdash;Our <HI>Sacraments</HI> are eight Weeks a&s;under, and I receiv'd into our Communion about an <HI>hundred</HI> before one Sacrament, and <HI>four&s;core</HI> of them at one time, who&s;e Appearance, when they pre|&s;ented them&s;elves together to make an open explicit <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, was very affecting to the Congregation:&mdash;I took in near &s;ixty before the next Sacrament Day: But it mu&s;t be noted that it is not the Cu&s;tom here, as it is in many other Churches in this Country, to make a credible Relation of their inward Experiences the ground of Admi&s;&s;ion to the Lord's Supper.</P>
<P>I am far from pretending to be able to determine how many have lately been the Subjects of &s;uch Mercy; but it I may be allowed to declare any thing that appears to me probable in a thing of this nature, I hope that more than three Hundred Souls were &s;avingly brought home to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in this Town, in the &s;pace of half a Year, (how many more I don't gue&s;s) and about the &s;ame Number of Males as Females; which, by what I have heard Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI> &s;ay, was far from what has been u&s;ual in Years pa&s;t, for he ob&s;erved that in his Time, many more Women were converted than Men. Tho&s;e of our young People, that are on other accounts mo&s;t likely and con&s;iderable, are mo&s;tly, as I hope, truly Pious, and leading Per&s;ons in Ways of Religion. Tho&s;e that were formerly loo&s;er young Per&s;ons, are generally to all Appearance, become true Lovers of God and <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;piritual in their Di&s;po&s;itions. And I hope that by far the greater part of Per&s;ons in this Town, above 16 years of Age, are &s;uch as have the &s;aving knowledge of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and &s;o by what I heard I &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ppo&s;e it is in &s;ome other Places, particularly a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Sunderland</HI> and <HI>South Hadley.</HI></P>

extended not only his <HI>awakening,</HI> but <HI>regenerating</HI> Influences both to <HI>elderly</HI> Per&s;ons, and al&s;o tho&s;e that are <HI>very young.</HI> It has been a thing heretof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e rarely to be heard of, that <HI>any</HI> were converted, pa&s;t middle Age; but now we have the &s;ame Ground to think, that <HI>many &s;uch</HI> have in this time been &s;avingly changed, as that <HI>others</HI> have been &s;o in more early Years. I &s;uppo&s;e there were upwards of <HI>fifty</HI> Per&s;ons in this Town above 40 years of Age; and more than <HI>twenty</HI> of them above 50, and about <HI>ten</HI> of them above 60, and <HI>two</HI> of them above 70 years of Age.</P>
<P>It has heretofore been looked on as a &s;trange Thing, when any have &s;eem'd to be &s;avingly wrought upon, and remarkably changed in their Childhood; but now I &s;uppo&s;e, near <HI>thirty</HI> were to Appearance &s;o wrought upon between 10 and 14 Years of Age, and <HI>two</HI> be|tween 9 and 10, and <HI>one</HI> of about 4 years of Age; and becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e this la&s;t will be mo&s;t difficultly believed, I will hereafter give a particular Account of it. The Influences of God's Spirit have al&s;o been very remarkable on Children in &s;ome other Places, particu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ly at <HI>Sunderland</HI> and <HI>South-Hadley,</HI> and the We&s;t part of <HI>Suffield.</HI> There are &s;everal Families in this Town that are all hopefully pious; yea, there are &s;everal numerous Families, in which, I think we have rea&s;on to hope that all the Children are truly godly, and mo&s;t of them lately become &s;o: And there are very few Hou&s;es in the whole Town, into which Salvation has not lately come, in one or more In&s;tances.

<P>God has al&s;o &s;eemed to have gone out of his u&s;ual way, in the <HI>Quickne&s;s</HI> of his Work, and the &s;wift Pro|gre&s;s his Spirit has made in his Operations on the Hearts of many: 'Tis wonderful that Per&s;ons &s;hould be &s;o &s;uddenly, and yet &s;o greatly changed: Many have been taken from a loo&s;e and carele&s;s way of Living, and &s;eized with &s;trong Convictions of their Guilt and

Mi&s;ery, and in a very little time old Things have pa&s;&s;ed away, and all Things have become new with them.</P>
<P>God's Work has al&s;o appeared very extraordinary, in the <HI>Degrees</HI> of the Influences of his Spirit, both in the Degree of <HI>Awakening</HI> and <HI>Conviction,</HI> and al&s;o in the Degree of <HI>&s;aving Light,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Joy,</HI> that many have experienced. It has al&s;o been very ex|traordinary in the <HI>Extent</HI> of it, and its being &s;o &s;wiftly propagated from Town to Town. In former Times of the pouring out of the Spirit of God on this Town, tho' in &s;ome of them it was very Remarkable, yet it reached no further than this Town, the neighbouring Towns all around continued unmoved.</P>
<P>The Work of God's Spirit &s;eemed to be at its great|e&s;t Height in this Town, in the former part of the <HI>Spring,</HI> in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April;</HI> at which time God's Work in the Conver&s;ion of Souls was carried on among&s;t us in &s;o wonderful a manner, that &s;o far as I, by looking back, can judge from the particular Acquaintance I have had with Souls in this Work, it appears to me probable, to have been at the Rate, at lea&s;t, of four Per&s;ons in a Day, or near thirty in a Week, take one with another, for five or &s;ix Weeks together: When God in &s;o re|markable a manner took the Work into his own Hands, there was as much done in a Day or two, as at or|dinary Times, with all Endeavours that Men can u&s;e, and with &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ing as we commonly have, is done in a Year.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible how apt many would be, if they &s;hould &s;ee the Account I have here given, pre&s;ently to think with them&s;elves that I am very fond of making a great many Converts, and of magnifying and aggran|di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the matter; and to think that, for want of Judg|ment, I take every religious Pang, and enthu&s;ia&s;tick Conceit, for &s;aving Conver&s;ion; and I don't much wonder if they &s;hould be apt to think &s;o&punc; and for this rea&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have forborn to publi&s;h an Account of this great Work of God, tho' I have often been put upon it; but having now as I thought a &s;pecial Call to give an account of it, upon mature Con&s;ideration, I thought it
<PB N="19" REF="004239_0327_10042FEEA1394790">
might not be be&s;ide my Duty to declare this amazing Work, as it appear'd to me, to be indeed Divine, and to conceal no part of the Glory of it, leaving it with God to take care of the Credit of his own Work, and running the venture of any cen&s;orious Thoughts, which might be entertain'd of me to my di&s;advantage: But that di&s;tant Per&s;ons may be under as great Advantage as may be, to judge for them&s;elves of this Matter, I would be a little more large, and particular.</P>
<P>I therefore proceed to give an Account of the <HI>manner</HI> of Per&s;ons being wrought upon; and here there is a <HI>va&s;t Variety,</HI> perhaps as manifold as the Subjects of the Operation; but yet in many Things there is a <HI>great Analogy</HI> in all.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons are fir&s;t awaken'd with a Sen&s;e of their mi&s;erable Condition by Nature, the Danger they are in of peri&s;h|ing eternally, and that it is of great Importance to them that they &s;peedily e&s;cape, and get into a better State. Tho&s;e that before were &s;ecure and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, are made &s;en&s;ible how much they were in the way to ruin in their former Cour&s;es. <HI>Some</HI> are more &s;uddenly &s;eized with Convictions; it may be, by the News of others Conver&s;ion, or &s;omething they hear in publick, or in private Conference, their Con&s;ciences are &s;uddenly &s;mit|ten, as if their Hearts were pierced through with a Dart: <HI>Others</HI> have Awakenings that come upon them more gradually, they begin as fir&s;t to be &s;omething more thoughtful and con&s;iderate, &s;o as to come to a Conclu&s;ion in their Minds, that 'tis their be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t way to delay no longer, but to improve the pre&s;ent Opportunity; and have accordingly &s;et them&s;eves &s;eri|ou&s;ly to meditate on tho&s;e Things that have the mo&s;t awakening Tendency, on purpo&s;e to obtain <HI>Convictions;</HI> and &s;o their Awakenings have increa&s;ed, till a Sen&s;e of their Mi&s;ery, by God's Spirit &s;etting in therewith, has had fa&s;t hold of them. <HI>Others</HI> that, before this wonderful time, had been &s;omething religious and con|cern'd for their Salvation, have been awaken'd in a new manner, and made &s;en&s;ible that their &s;lack and dull way of &s;eeking was never like to attain their Purpo&s;e, and
<PB N="20" REF="004239_0328_10042FF285BBB278">
&s;o have been rou&s;ed up to a greater Violence for the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>The&s;e Awakenings when they have fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t &s;eized on Per&s;ons have had two Effects: One was, that they have brought them immediately to quit their &s;inful Practices, and the loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er Sort have been brought to for&s;ake and dread their former Vices and Extravagancies When once the Spirit of God began to be &s;o wonderfully poured out in a general way thro' the Town, People had &s;oon done with their old Quarrels, Backbitings, and intermeddling with other Men's Matters; the Tavern was &s;oon left empty, and Per&s;ons kept very much at home; none went abr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad unle&s;s on nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s, or on &s;ome religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s Account, and every Day &s;eemed in many re&s;pects like a Sabbath Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. And the <HI>other</HI> Effect was, that it put them on earne&s;t Application to the means of Salvation, Reading, Prayer, Meditation, the Ordinances of God's Hou&s;e, and private Conference; their Cry was, <HI>What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</HI> The place of Re&s;ort was now altered, it was no longer the Tavern, but the Mini&s;ter's Hou&s;e; that was thronged far more than ever the Tavern had been wont to be.</P>
<P>There is a very great variety as to the Degree of Fear and Trouble that Per&s;ons are exerci&s;ed with, be|fore they obtain any comfortable Evidences of Pardon and Acceptance with God: &s;ome are from the beginning carried on with abundantly more Encouragement and Hope than others: &s;ome have had <HI>ten</HI> times le&s;s trouble of Mind than others, in whom yet the I&s;&s;ue &s;eems to be the &s;ame. Some have had &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Di&s;|plea&s;ure of God, and the great Danger they were in of Damnation, that they could not &s;leep at Nights; and many have &s;aid that when they have laid down, the Thoughts of &s;leeping in &s;uch a Conditon have been f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ightful to them, and they have &s;carcely been free from Terrour while they have been a&s;leep, and they have awaked with Fear, Heavine&s;s, and Di&s;tre&s;s &s;till abiding on their Spirits. It has been very common, that the deep and fixed Concern that has been on Per|&s;ons
<PB N="21" REF="004239_0329_10042FF531A38CD0">
Minds, has had a painful Influence on their Bodies, and had given Di&s;turbance to animal Nature.</P>
<P>The awful Apprehen&s;ions Per&s;ons have had of their Mi&s;ery, have for the mo&s;t part been increa&s;ing, the nearer they have approached to Deliverance; tho' they often pa&s;s through many Changes, and Alterations in the Frame, and Circum&s;tances of their Minds: Some|times they think them&s;elves wholly &s;en&s;le&s;s, and fear that the Spirit of God has left them, and that they are given up to judicial Hardne&s;s; yet they appear very deeply exerci&s;ed about that Fear, and are in great earne&s;t to obtain <HI>Convictions</HI> again.</P>
<P>Together with tho&s;e Fears, and that Exerci&s;e of Mind which is rational, and which they have ju&s;t ground for, they have often &s;uffer'd many needle&s;s Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Thought, in which <HI>Satan</HI> probably has a great hand, to entangle them, and block up their way; and &s;ome|times the Di&s;temper of Melancholy has been evidently mixed; of which when it happens, the Tempter &s;eems to make great advantage, and puts an unhappy Bar in the way of any good Effect; One knows not how to deal with &s;uch Per&s;ons, they turn every Thing that is &s;aid to them the wrong way, and mo&s;t to their own Di&s;advantage: And there is nothing that the Devil &s;eems to make &s;o great a handle of, as a melancholy Humour, unle&s;s it be the real Corruption of the Heart.</P>
<P>But it has been very remarkable, that there has been far le&s;s of this Mixture in this time of extraordinary Ble&s;&s;ing, than there was wont to be in Per&s;ons under awakenings at other Times; for it is evident that many that before had been exceedingly involved in &s;uch Difficulties, &s;eem'd now &s;trangely to be &s;et at liberty: Some Per&s;ons that had before, for a long time, been exceedingly entangled with peculiar Temptations, of one &s;ort or other, and unprofitable and hurtful Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, were &s;oon helped over former Stumbling Blocks, that hinder'd any Progre&s;s towards &s;aving Good; and Con|victions have wrought more kindly, and they have been &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on in the way to Life. And thus <HI>Satan</HI> &s;eemed to be re&s;train<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, till towards the latter
<PB N="22" REF="004239_0330_10042FF6B7381FA8">
end of this wonderful Time, when God's Spirit was a|bout to withdraw.</P>
<P>Many times Per&s;ons under great Awakenings were concerned, becau&s;e they thought they were not awaken'd, but mi&s;erable, hard-hearted, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ti&s;h Creatures &s;till, and &s;leeping upon the brink of Hell: The &s;en&s;e of the Need they have to be awaken'd, and of their comparative Hardne&s;s, grows upon them with their A|wakenings; &s;o that they &s;eem to them&s;elves to be very <HI>&s;en&s;ele&s;s,</HI> when indeed mo&s;t <HI>&s;en&s;ible.</HI> There have been &s;ome In&s;tances of Per&s;ons that have had as great a Sen&s;e of their Danger and Mi&s;ery, as their Natures could well &s;ub&s;i&s;t under, &s;o that a little more would probably have de&s;troyed them; and yet they have expre&s;t them&s;elves much amazed at their own In&s;en&s;i|bility and Sotti&s;hne&s;s, in &s;uch an extraordinary Time as it then was.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons are &s;ometimes brought to the Borders of Di&s;|pair, and it looks as black as Midnight to them a little before the Day dawns in their Souls; &s;ome few In&s;tances there have been of Per&s;ons, who have had &s;uch a Sen&s;e of God's Wrath for Sin, that they have been overborn, and made to cry out under an a&s;toni&s;h|ing Sen&s;e of their Guilt, wondering that God &s;uffers &s;uch guilty Wretches to live upon Earth, and that he doth not immediately &s;end them to Hell; and &s;ometimes their Guilt does &s;o glare them in the Face, that they are in exceeding Terrour for fear that God will in|&s;tantly do it; but more commonly the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es under legal Awakenings have not been to &s;uch a Degree. In &s;ome the&s;e Terrours don't &s;eem to be &s;o &s;harp, when near Comfort, as before; their Convictions have not &s;eem'd to work &s;o much that way, but they &s;eem to be led further down into their own Hearts, to a further Sen&s;e of their own univer&s;al Depravity, &amp; Deadne&s;s in Sin.</P>
<P>The Corruption of the Heart has di&s;cover'd it &s;elf in various Exerci&s;es, in the time of legal Convictions; &s;ometimes it appears in a great Struggle, like &s;omething rou&s;ed by an Enemy, and <HI>Satan</HI> the old Inhabitant &s;eems to exert him&s;elf, like a Serpent di&s;turbed and
<PB N="23" REF="004239_0331_10042FF8406DAE20">
enraged. Many in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, have felt a great Spirit of Envy, towards the Godly, e&s;pecially towards tho&s;e that are thought to have been lately converted, and mo&s;t of all towards Acquaintance and Companions, <HI>when they</HI> are thought to be converted: Indeed, &s;ome have felt many Heart-ri&s;ings again&s;t God, and murmurings at his ways of Dealing with Mankind, and his Deal|ings with them&s;elves in Particular. It has been much in&s;i&s;ted on, both in publick and private, that Per&s;ons &s;hould have the utmo&s;t dreard of &s;uch en|vious Thoughts, which if allowed tend exceedingly to quench the Spirit of God, if not to provoke him finally to for&s;ake them. And when &s;uch a Spirit has much prevailed, and Per&s;ons have not &s;o earne&s;tly &s;trove a|gain&s;t it as they ought to have done, it has &s;eem'd to be exceedingly to the hindrance of the Good of their Souls: but in &s;ome other In&s;tances, where Per&s;ons have been much terrified at the Sight of &s;uch Wickedne&s;s in their Hearts, God has brought Good to them out of Evil; and made it a Means of convincing them of their own de&s;perate Sinfulne&s;s, and bringing them off from all Self-confidence.</P>
<P>The drift of the Spirit of God in his <HI>legal</HI> &s;trivings with Per&s;ons, has &s;eem'd mo&s;t evidently to be, to make way for, and to bring to, a Conviction of their ab|&s;olute Dependance on his &s;overeign Power and Grace, and univer&s;al Nece&s;&s;ity of a Mediator, by leading them more and more to a Sen&s;e of their exceeding Wicked|ne&s;s and Guiltine&s;s in his &s;ight; the Pollution and In|&s;ufficiency of their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that they can in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">no wi&s;e help them&s;elves, and that God would be wholly ju&s;t and righteous in rejecting them, and all that they do, and in ca&s;ting them off for ever: Tho' there be a va&s;t variety, as to the manner, and di|&s;tinctne&s;s of Per&s;ons Convictions of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>As they are gradually more and more convinced of the Corruption and Wickedne&s;s of their Hearts, they &s;eem to them&s;elves to grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, harder and blinder, and more de&s;perately wicked, in&s;tead of growing better; they are ready to be di&s;couraged by
<PB N="24" REF="004239_0332_10042FFAF97726B0">
it, and oftentimes never think them&s;elves &s;o <HI>far off</HI> from Good as when they are <HI>neare&s;t.</HI> Under the &s;en&s;e which the Spirit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> God gives them of their Sinfulne&s;s, they often think that they differ from all others; their Hearts are ready to &s;ink with the thought, that they are the wor&s;t of all, and that none ever obtained Mercy that were &s;o wicked as they.</P>
<P>When Awakenings <HI>fir&s;t begin,</HI> their Con&s;ciences are commonly mo&s;t exerci&s;ed about their outward vicious Cour&s;e, or other Acts of Sin; but <HI>afterwards</HI> are much more burdened with a &s;en&s;e of Heart &s;ins, the dreadful Corruption of their Nature, their Enmity again&s;t God, the Pride of their Hearts, their Unbelief, their Re|jection of Chri&s;t, the Stubbornne&s;s and Ob&s;tinacy of their Wills; and the like. In many, God makes much u&s;e of their own Experience, in the cour&s;e of their Awaken|ings and Endeavours after &s;aving Good, to convince them of their own vile Emptine&s;s and univer&s;al Depravity.</P>
<P>Very often under fir&s;t Awakenings, when they are brought to reflect on the Sin of their pa&s;t Lives, and have &s;omething of a terrifying &s;en&s;e of God's Anger, they &s;et them&s;elves to walk more &s;trictly, and confe&s;&s; their Sins, and perform many religious Dutys, with a &s;ecret Hope of appea&s;ing God's Anger and making up for the Sins they have committed&punc; and oftentimes, at fir&s;t &s;etting out, their Affections are moved, and they are full of Tears, in their Confe&s;&s;ions and Prayers, which they are ready to make very much of, as tho' they were &s;ome Attonement, and had Power to move cor|re&s;pondent Affections in God too: and hence they are for a while big with Expectation of what God will do for them; and conceive that they grow better apace, and &s;hall &s;oon be thoroughly converted. But the&s;e Af|fections are but &s;hort-lived, they quickly find that they fail, and then they think them&s;elves to be grown wor&s;e again; they don't find &s;uch a Pro&s;pect of being &s;oon converted, as they thought: in&s;tead of being <HI>nearer,</HI> they &s;eem to be <HI>farther off;</HI> their Hearts they think are grown harder, and by this means their fears of peri&s;hing greatly increa&s;e. But tho' they are di&s;appointed, they
<PB N="25" REF="004239_0333_10042FFFF738D740">
renew their Attempts again and again; and &s;till as their Attempts are Multiplied, &s;o are their Di&s;appointments; all fails, they &s;ee no token of having inclin'd God's Heart to them, they don't &s;ee that he hears their Prayers at all, as they expected he would; and &s;ometimes there have been great Temptations ari&s;ing hence to leave off &s;eeking, and to yield up the Ca&s;e. But as they are &s;till more terrify'd with Fears of peri&s;hing, and their former Hopes of prevailing on God to be merciful to them in a great mea&s;ure fail; &s;ometimes their religious Affections have turn'd into Heart-ri&s;ings again&s;t God, be|cau&s;e that he won't pity them, and &s;eems to have lit|tle regard to their Di&s;tre&s;s, and piteous Cries, and to all the Pains that they take; They think of the Mercy that God has &s;hown to others, how &s;oon, and how ea&s;ily o|thers have obtained Comfort, and tho&s;e too that were wor&s;e than they, and have not labour'd &s;o much as they have done, and &s;ometimes they have had even dreadful bla&s;phemous Thoughts, in the&s;e Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>But when they reflect on the&s;e wicked Workings of Heart again&s;t God, if their Convictions are continued&punc; and the Spirit of God, is not provoked utterly to for|&s;ake them, they have more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Apprehen&s;ions of the Anger of God <HI>towards tho&s;e,</HI> who&s;e Hearts work af|ter &s;uch a &s;inful manner <HI>about him;</HI> and it may be have great Fears that they have committed the unpardonable Sin, or that God will &s;urely never &s;hew Mercy to them that are &s;uch Vipers; and are often tempted to leave off in de&s;pair. But then perhaps by &s;omething they read or hear of the infinite Mercy of God, and All-&s;ufficiency of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for the chief of Sinners; they have &s;ome Encourage|ment and Hope renewed; but think that as yet they are not fit to come to <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> they are &s;o wicked that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will never accept of them: and then it may be they &s;et them&s;elves upon a new Cour&s;e of fruitle&s;s Endeavours in their own Strength to make them&s;elves better, and &s;till meet with new Di&s;appointments: They are earne&s;t to enquire what they &s;hall do? They don't know but there is &s;omething el&s;e to be done, in order to their obtaining converting Grace, that they have never done yet.
<PB N="26" REF="004239_0334_10040535F0628920">
It may be they hope that they are &s;omething better than they were; but then the plea&s;ing Dream all vani&s;hes again. If they are told, that they tru&s;t too much to their own Strength and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, they go about to &s;trive to bring them&s;elves off from it, and it may be, think they have done it, when they only do the &s;ame thing under a new di&s;gui&s;e, and &s;till find no ap|pearance of any Good, but all looks as dark as Mid|night to them. Thus they wander about from Mountain to Hill, &s;eeking re&s;t, and finding none: when they are beat out of <HI>one</HI> Refuge they fly to <HI>another,</HI> till they are as it were debilitated, broken, and &s;ubdued with legal Humblings; in which God gives them a Conviction of their own utter Helple&s;&s;ne&s;s and In&s;ufficiency, and di&s;|covers the true Remedy.</P>
<P>When they begin to &s;eek Salvation, they are com|monly profoundly ignorant of them&s;elves; they are not &s;en&s;ible how blind they are, and how little they can do <HI>towards</HI> bringing them&s;elves to &s;ee &s;piritual things aright, and <HI>towards</HI> putting forth gracious Exerci&s;es in their own Souls: they are not &s;en&s;ible how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">remote they are from Love to God, and other holy Di&s;po&s;itions, and how dead they are in Sin. When they &s;ee un|expected Pollution in their own Hearts, they go about to wa&s;h away their own Defilements and make them|&s;elves clean; and they weary them&s;elves in vain, till God &s;hows them that 'tis in vain, and that their help is not where they have &s;ought it, but el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>But &s;ome Per&s;ons continue wandering in &s;uch a kind of Labyrinth, ten times as long as others, before their own Experience will convince them of their In&s;ufficiency; and &s;o it appears not to be their own Experience only, but the convincing Influence of God's Spirit with their Experience, that attains the Effect: and God has of late abundantly &s;hown, that he don't need to wait to have Men convinced by long and often repeated fruitle&s;s Trials; for in multitudes of In&s;tances he has made a &s;horter work of it: he has &s;o awakened and convinced Per&s;ons Con&s;ciences, and made them &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their exceeding great Vilene&s;s, and given 'em &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of

his Wrath again&s;t Sin, as has quickly overcome all their vain Self-confidence, and born them down into the Du&s;t before a holy and righteous God.</P>
<P>There have been &s;ome who have not had great Terrors, but have had a very quick Work. Some of tho&s;e that han't had &s;o deep a Conviction of the&s;e things before their Conver&s;ion, have, it may be, much more of it after|wards.

In <HI>&s;ome</HI> In&s;tances it &s;eems ea&s;y for our rea&s;oning Powers to di&s;cern the methods of divine Wi&s;dom, in his Dealings with the Soul under awakenings: in <HI>others</HI> his Foot-&s;teps can't be traced, and his Ways are pa&s;t finding out: and &s;ome that are <HI>le&s;s di&s;tinctly</HI> wrought upon, in what is preparatory to Grace, appear <HI>no le&s;s eminent</HI> in gracious experiences after|wards.</P>
<P>There is in nothing a greater Difference, in different Per&s;ons, than with re&s;pect to the <HI>Time</HI> of their being un|der Trouble; &s;ome but a few Days, and others for Months or Years. There were many in this Town, that had been, before this Effu&s;ion of God's Spirit upon us, for Years, and &s;ome for many Years, concerned a|bout their Salvation; tho' probably they were not thoroughly awaken'd, yet they were concern'd to &s;uch a Degree as to be very unea&s;y, &s;o as to live an uncom|fortable di&s;quieted Life, and &s;o as to continue in a way of taking con&s;iderable Pains about their Salvation, but had never obtained any comfortable Evidence of a good E&s;tate, who now in this extraordinary time have received Light; but many of them were &s;ome of the la&s;t: They fir&s;t &s;aw Multitudes of others rejoicing, and with Songs of Deliverance in their Mouths, who &s;eem'd wholly carele&s;s and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, and in pur&s;uit of Vanity, while they had been bowed down with &s;ollicitude about their Souls; yea &s;ome had lived licenciou&s;ly, and &s;o continued till a little before they were converted, and grew up to a holy Rejoicing in the infinite Ble&s;&s;ings God had be&s;towed upon <HI>them.</HI></P>

with Souls, in a Flock under &s;uch Circum&s;tances as this was in the la&s;t Year, I can't but think he will &s;oon find him&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity, greatly to in&s;i&s;t upon it with them, that God is under no manner of Obligation to &s;hew Mercy to any natural Man, who&s;e Heart is not turn'd to God: and that a Man can challenge nothing, either in <HI>ab&s;olute Ju&s;tice,</HI> or by <HI>free Promi&s;e,</HI> from any Thing he does before he has believed on <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> or has true Repentance begun in him. It appears to me, that if I had taught tho&s;e that came to me under Trouble, any other Doctrine, I &s;hould have taken a mo&s;t direct Cour&s;e utterly to have undone them; I &s;hould have di|rectly cro&s;s'd what was plainly the Drift of the Spirit of God in his Influence upon them; for if they had be|lieved what I &s;aid, it would either have promoted Self-flattery and Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o put an End to their A|wakenings; or cheri&s;hed and e&s;tabli&s;hed their Conten|tion and Strife with God, concerning his Dealings with them and others, and block'd up their Way to that Hu|miliation before the Sovereign Di&s;po&s;er of Life and Death, whereby God is wont to prepare them for his Con&s;ola|tions.

<P>There is a great deal of difference as to Per&s;ons <HI>Di&s;tinctne&s;s</HI> here; &s;ome, that han't &s;o clear a Sight of God's Ju&s;tice in their Condemnation, yet mention things that plainly imply it.

<P>Commonly Per&s;ons Minds immediately before this Di&s;|covery of God's Ju&s;tice are exceeding re&s;tle&s;s, and in a kind of Struggle and Tumult, and &s;ometimes in meer An|gui&s;h; but generally, as &s;oon as they have this Convicti|on, it immediately brings their Minds to a Calm, and a before unexpected Quietne&s;s and Compo&s;ure; and mo&s;t frequently, tho' not always, <HI>then</HI> the pre&s;&s;ing weight upon their Spirits is taken away, and a general Hope a|ri&s;es, that &s;ome time or other God will be gracious, even before any di&s;tinct and particular Di&s;coveries of Mercy; and often they then come to a Conclu&s;ion within them&s;elves, that they will lie at God's Feet, and wait his Time, and they re&s;t in that, not being &s;en&s;ible that the Spirit of God has now brought them to a Frame whereby they are prepared for Mercy: for 'tis remarkable that per&s;ons, when they fir&s;t have this &s;en&s;e of the Ju&s;tice of God, rarely in the time of it, think any thing of its being that <HI>Humiliation</HI> that they have often heard in&s;i&s;ted on, and that others experience.</P>

Terrors and Convictions; but rather from an high Ex|erci&s;e of Grace, in &s;aving Repentance, and evangelical Humiliation; for there is in it a &s;ort of Complacency of Soul, in the <HI>Attribute</HI> of God's Ju&s;tice, as di&s;play'd in his Threatnings of eternal Damnation to Sinners.

<P>Some, when in &s;uch Circum&s;tances; have felt that &s;en&s;e of the Excellency of God's Ju&s;tice, appearing in the vindictive Exerci&s;es of it, again&s;t &s;uch Sinfulne&s;s as theirs was, and have had &s;uch a Submi&s;&s;ion of Mind in their <HI>Idea</HI> of this Attribute, and of tho&s;e Exerci&s;es of it, together with an exceeding loathing of their own Unworthine&s;s, and a kind of Indignation again&s;t them|&s;elves, that they have &s;ometimes almo&s;t call'd it a <HI>Willingne&s;s to be damned;</HI> tho' it mu&s;t be owned they had not clear and di&s;tinct Ideas of Damnation, nor does any Word in the Bible require &s;uch Self denial as this.

<P>The way that Grace &s;eems &s;ometimes fir&s;t to appear after legal Humiliation, is in earne&s;t Longings of Soul after God and <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to know God, to love him, to be humbled before him, to have Communion with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in his Benefits, which Longings, as they expre&s;s them, &s;eem evidently to be of &s;uch a nature as can ari&s;e from nothing but a &s;en&s;e of the &s;uperlative Excellency of divine things, with a &s;piritual Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h of 'em, and an E&s;teem of 'em as their highe&s;t Happine&s;s and be&s;t Portion.

<P>So &s;ometimes di&s;con&s;olate Souls among&s;t us, have been revived and brought to re&s;t in God, by a &s;weet &s;en&s;e given of his Grace and Faithfulne&s;s, in &s;ome &s;pecial Invitation or Promi&s;e, in which is no particular men|tion of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> nor is it accompanied with any di&s;tinct Thought of him, in their Minds; but yet it is not received as <HI>out of Chri&s;t,</HI> but as one of the Invitations or Promi&s;es made of God to poor Sinners <HI>through</HI> his Son <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as it is indeed: and &s;uch Per&s;ons have af|terwards had clear and di&s;tinct Di&s;coveries of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> accompanied with lively and &s;pecial Actings of Faith and Love towards him.</P>
<P>It has more frequently been &s;o among&s;t us, that when Per&s;ons have fir&s;t had the Go&s;pel Ground of Relief for lo&s;t Sinners di&s;covered to them, and have been entertain|ing their Minds with the &s;weet Pro&s;pect, they have thought nothing at that time of their being converted: To &s;ee that there is &s;uch an All-&s;ufficiency in God, and &s;uch plentiful Provi&s;ion made in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> after they have been borne down, and &s;unk with a &s;en&s;e of their Guilt and Fears of Wrath, exceedingly refre&s;hes them; the View is joyful to them, as 'tis in its own nature glorious, and gives them quite new, and more delightful <HI>Ideas</HI> of God and <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and greatly encourages them to &s;eek Conver&s;ion, and begets in them a &s;trong Re|&s;olution to give up them&s;elves, and devote their whole Lives to God and his Son, and patiently to wait till

God &s;hall &s;ee fit to make all effectual; and very often they entertain a &s;trong Per&s;ua&s;ion, that he will in his own time do it for them.</P>
<P>There is wrought in them a holy Repo&s;e of Soul in God through <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and a &s;ecret Di&s;po&s;ition to fear and love him, and to hope for Ble&s;&s;ings from him in this Way: and yet they have no Imagination that they are now converted, it don't &s;o much as come into their Minds: and very often the Rea&s;on is, that they don't &s;ee that they do <HI>accept</HI> of this &s;ufficiency of Salvation, that they behold in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> having entertain'd a wrong Notion of <HI>Acceptance;</HI> not being &s;en&s;ible that the obe|dient and joyful Entertainment which their Hearts give to this Di&s;covery of Grace, is a real Acceptance of it: They know not that the &s;weet Complacence they feel in the Mercy and complete Salvation of God, as it in|cludes Pardon and Sanctification, and is held forth to them only through <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is a true receiving of this Mercy, or a plain Evidence of their receiving it. They expected I know not what Kind of Act of Soul, and perhaps they had no di&s;tinct <HI>Idea</HI> of it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And indeed it appears very plainly in &s;ome of them, that before their own Conver&s;ion they had very <HI>imperfect Ideas</HI> what Conver&s;ion was: It is all new and &s;trange, and what there was no clear Conception of before. 'Tis mo&s;t evident as they them&s;elves acknowledge, that the Expre&s;&s;ions that were u&s;ed to de&s;cribe Conver&s;ion, and the Graces of God's Spirit, &s;uch as <HI>a &s;piritual Sight of Chri&s;t, Faith in Chri&s;t, Poverty of Spirit, Tru&s;t in God, Re&s;ignedne&s;s to God,</HI> &amp;c. were Expre&s;&s;ions that did not convey tho&s;e &s;pecial and di&s;tinct <HI>Ideas</HI> to their Minds, which they were intended to &s;ignify, in &s;ome re&s;pects no more than the Names of Colours are to convey the <HI>Ideas</HI> to one that is blind from his Birth.</P>
<P>This Town is a Place where there has always been a great deal of Talk of Conver&s;ion, and &s;piritual Ex|periences; and therefore People in general had before form'd a Notion in their own Minds what the&s;e things were; but when they come to be the Subjects of them them&s;elves, they find them&s;elves much confounded in
<PB N="36" REF="004239_0344_10043019A57D32D0">
their Notions, and overthrown in many of their former Conceits. And it has been very ob&s;ervable, that Per|&s;ons of the greate&s;t Under&s;tanding, and that had &s;tudied mo&s;t about things of this nature, have been more con|founded than others. Some &s;uch Per&s;ons that have lately been converted, declare that all their former Wi&s;dom is brought to nought, and that they appear to have been meer Babes, who knew nothing It has appear'd that none have &s;tood more in need of Enlightning and In&s;truction, even of their Fellow Chri&s;tians, concerning their own Circum&s;tances and Difficulties, than they: and it has &s;eem'd to have been with delight, that they have &s;een them&s;elves thus brought down and become <HI>nothing,</HI> that free Grace, and divine Power may be <HI>exalted</HI> in them.</P>
<P>It was very wonderful to &s;ee after what manner Per&s;ons Affections were &s;ometimes moved and wrought upon, when God did as it were, &s;uddenly open their Eyes and let into their Minds, a &s;en&s;e of the Greatne&s;s of his Grace, and Fulne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and his readine&s;s to &s;ave, who before were broken with Apprehen&s;ions of divine Wrath, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">unk into an Aby&s;s under a &s;en&s;e of Guilt, which they were ready to think was beyond the Mercy of God: their joyful Surprize has cau&s;ed their Hearts as it were to leap, &s;o that they have been ready to break forth into Laughter, Tears often at the &s;ame time i&s;&s;uing like a Flood, and intermingling a loud Weeping: and &s;ometimes they han't been able to for|bear crying out with a loud Voice, expre&s;&s;ing their great Admiration. In &s;ome even the View of the Glory of God's Sovereignty in the Exerci&s;es of his Grace has &s;urprized the Soul with &s;uch Sweetne&s;s, as to produce the &s;ame Effects.

<P>Many continue a long time in a Cour&s;e of gracious Exerci&s;es and Experiences, and don't think them&s;elves to be converted, but conclude them&s;elves to be otherwi&s;e; and none knows how long they would continue &s;o, were they not helped by particular In&s;truction.

<P>Grace in many Per&s;ons, through this Ignorance of their State, and their looking on them&s;elves &s;till as the Objects of God's Di&s;plea&s;ure, has been like the Trees in Winter, or like Seed in the Spring &s;uppre&s;&s;ed under a hard Clod of Earth; and many in &s;uch Ca&s;es have laboured to their utmo&s;t to divert their Minds from the plea&s;ing and joyful Views they have had, and to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e Con&s;olations and gracious Affections that aro&s;e thereupon.

<P>There is no one thing that I know of that God has made &s;uch a means of promoting his Work among&s;t us, as the News of others Conver&s;ion; in the awaken|ing Sinners, and engaging them earne&s;tly to &s;eek the &s;ame Ble&s;&s;ing, and in the quickening of Saints.

<P>Conver&s;ion is a great and glorious Work of God's Power, at once Changing the Heart, and infu&s;ing Life into the dead Soul; tho' that Grace that is then im|planted does more gradually di&s;play it &s;elf in &s;ome than in others But as to fixing on the <HI>preci&s;e Time</HI> when they put forth the very fir&s;t Act of Grace, there is a great deal of difference in different Per&s;ons; in &s;ome it &s;eems to be very di&s;cernable when the very Time of this was; but others are more at a lo&s;s. In <HI>this re&s;pect</HI> there are very many that don't know the Time, (as has been already ob&s;erved) that when they have the fir&s;t Exerci&s;es of Grace, don't know that <HI>it is</HI> the Grace of Conver&s;ion, and &s;ometimes don't think it to be &s;o till a long time after: And many, even when they come to entertain great Hope that they are con|verted if they remember what they experienced in the fir&s;t Exerci&s;es of Grace, they are at a lo&s;s whether it

was any more than a common Illumination; or whether &s;ome other, more clear and remarkable Experience, that they had afterwards, was not the fir&s;t that was of a &s;aving nature And the manner of God's Work on the Soul is (&s;ometimes e&s;pecially) very my&s;terious, and 'tis with the Kingdom of God as to it.

<P>In <HI>&s;ome,</HI> converting Light is like a glorious Bright|ne&s;s &s;uddenly &s;hining in <HI>upon</HI> a Per&s;on, and all <HI>around</HI> him: They are in a remarkable manner brought <HI>out of Darkne&s;s into marvellous Light.</HI> In many <HI>others</HI> it has been like the dawning of the Day, when at fir&s;t but a little Light appears, and it may be is pre&s;ently hid with a Cloud; and then it appears again, and &s;hines a little brighter, and gradually increa&s;es, with intervening Darkne&s;s, till at length, perhaps, it breaks forth more clearly from behind the Clouds. And many are, doubt|le&s;s, ready to date their Conver&s;ion wrong, throwing by tho&s;e le&s;&s;er Degrees of Light that appeared at fir&s;t dawning, and calling &s;ome mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> remarkable Experience, they had afterwards, their Conver&s;ions; which often in great mea&s;ure ari&s;es from a wrong Under&s;tanding of what they have always been taught, that Conver&s;ion is a great Change, wherein <HI>old Things are done away, and all Things become now,</HI> or at lea&s;t from a fal&s;e argu|ing from that Doctrine.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons commonly at fir&s;t Conver&s;ion, and afterwards, have had many Texts of Scripture brought to their Minds, that are exceeding &s;uitable to their Circum&s;tances, which often come with great Power, and as the Word of God or <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> indeed; and many have a multitude of &s;wee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Invitations, Promi&s;es, and Doxologi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s flowing in one after another, bringing great Light and Comfort with them, filling the Soul brim f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, enlarging the Heart, and opening the Mouth in Religion.

&s;eems to me nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e, that there is an im|mediate Influence of the Spirit of God, oftentimes in bringing Texts of Scripture to the Mind: Not that I &s;uppo&s;e 'tis done in a way of immediate Revelation, without any manner of u&s;e of the Memory; but yet there &s;eems plainly to be an immediate and extraordinary Influence, in leading their Thoughts &s;o &s;uch and &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, and exciting them <HI>in the Me|mory.</HI> Indeed in &s;ome God &s;eems to bring Texts of Scripture to their Minds no otherwi&s;e than by leading them into &s;uch Frames and Meditations, as harmonize with tho&s;e Scriptures; but in many Per&s;ons there &s;eems to be &s;omething more than this.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that, while under legal Convictions, have had the greate&s;t Terrors, have not always obtain'd the greate&s;t Light and Comfort; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> have they always Light mo&s;t &s;uddenly communicated; but yet, I think, the time of Conver&s;ion has generally been mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible in &s;uch Per&s;ons. Oftentimes, the fir&s;t &s;en&s;ible Change after the Extremity of Terrors, is a Calmne&s;s, and then the Light gradually comes in; <HI>&s;mall Glimp&s;es</HI> at fir&s;t, after their midnight Darkne&s;s, and <HI>a word or two of Comfort,</HI> as it were &s;oftly &s;poken to 'em; they have a <HI>little Ta&s;te</HI> of the Sweetne&s;s of divine Grace, 'and the Love of a Saviour, when Terror and Di&s;tre&s;s of Con&s;cience begins to be turned into an humble, meek Sen&s;e of their own Unworthine&s;s before God; and there is felt inwardly, perhaps, &s;ome Di&s;po&s;ition to prai&s;e God; and after a little while the Light comes in more clearly and powerfully. But yet, I think more frequently, great Terrors have been followed with more &s;udden and great Light, and Comfort; when the Sinner &s;eems to be as it were &s;ubdued and brought to a Calm, from a kind of Tumult of Mind, then God lets in an extraordinary Sen&s;e of his great Mercy thro' a Redeemer.</P>
<P>The converting Influences of God's Spirit very com|monly bring an extraordinary Conviction of the Reality and Certainty of the great Things of Religion; (tho' in &s;ome this is much greater, &s;ome time after Con|ver&s;ion, than at fir&s;t&punc;) they have that &s;ight and ta&s;te of
<PB N="42" REF="004239_0350_100430261ADA9E58">
the Divinity, or divine Excellency, that there is in the Things of the Go&s;pel, that is more to convince them, than reading many Volumes of Arguments without it. It &s;eems to me that in many In&s;tances among&s;t us, when the divine Excellency and Glory of the Things of Chri&s;tianity have been &s;et before Per&s;ons, and they have at the &s;ame time as it were &s;een, and ta&s;ted, and felt the Divinity of them, they have been as far from doubting of the Truth of them, as they are from doubting whether there be a Sun, when their Eyes are open upon it in the mid&s;t of a clear Hemi&s;phere, and the &s;trong Blaze of his Light overcomes all Objections again&s;t his Being. And yet many of them, if we &s;hould ask them why they believed tho&s;e Things to be true, would not be able well to expre&s;s, or communicate a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, to &s;atisfy the Enquirer, and perhaps would make no other An&s;wer but that they &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 'em to be true: But a Per&s;on might &s;oon be &s;atisfied, by a par|ticular Conver&s;ation with 'em, that what they mean by &s;uch an An&s;wer is, that they have intuitively beheld, and immediately felt mo&s;t illu&s;trious Works, and powerful Evidence of Divinity in them.</P>
<P>Some are thus convinced of the Truth of the Go&s;pel in general, and that the Scriptures are the Word of God: Others have their Minds more e&s;pecially fixed on &s;ome particular great Doctrine of the Go&s;pel, &s;ome particular Truths that they are <HI>meditating</HI> on; or are in a &s;pecial manner convinced of the Divinity of the Things they are <HI>reading</HI> of&punc; in &s;ome portion of Scripture. Some have &s;uch Convictions in a much more remarkable man|ner than others: And there are &s;ome that never had &s;uch a &s;pecial Sen&s;e of the Certainty of divine Things, impre&s;&s;ed upon them with &s;uch inward Evidence and Strength, have yet very clear Exerci&s;es of Grace; <HI>i. e.</HI> of Love to God, Repentance and Holine&s;s. And if they be more particularly examined, they appear plainly to have an inward firm Per&s;ua&s;ion of the Reality of divine Things, &s;uch as they don't u&s;e to have before their Conver&s;ion. And tho&s;e that have the mo&s;t clear Di&s;|coveries of divine Truth, in the manner that has been
<PB N="43" REF="004239_0351_10043027A159E720">
&s;poken of, can't have this always in view. When the Sen&s;e and Reli&s;h of the divine Excellency of the&s;e Things fades, on a withdraw of the Spirit of God, they han't the medium of the Conviction of their Truth at command: In a dull Frame they can't recall the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea,</HI> and inward Sen&s;e they had, prefectly to mind; Things appear very dim to what they did before: And tho' there &s;till remains an habitual &s;trong Per&s;ua&s;ion; yet not &s;o as to exclude Temptations to Unbelief, and all po&s;&s;ibility of Doubting, as before: But then at particular Times, by God's Help, the &s;ame Sen&s;e of Things revives again, like Fire that lay hid in A&s;hes.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the grounds of &s;uch a Conviction of the Truth of divine Things to be ju&s;t and rational, but yet in &s;ome God makes u&s;e of their own Rea&s;on much more &s;en&s;ibly than in others. Oftentimes Per&s;ons have (&s;o far as could be judged) receiv'd the fir&s;t &s;aving Conviction from rea&s;oning, which they have heard <HI>from the Pulpit;</HI> and often in the cour&s;e of Rea&s;oning, which they are led into <HI>in their own Meditations</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Arguments</HI> are the <HI>&s;ame</HI> that they have heard hundreds of times; but <HI>the Force of the Arguments, and their Conviction by 'em,</HI> is altogether new; they come with a new and before unexperienced Power: Before they <HI>heard it</HI> was &s;o, and they <HI>allow'd it</HI> to be &s;o; but now they <HI>&s;ee it</HI> to be &s;o indeed. Things now look exceeding plain to 'em, and they wonder that they did not &s;ee 'em before.</P>
<P>They are &s;o greatly taken with their new Di&s;covery, and Things appear &s;o plain, and &s;o rational to 'em, that they are often at fir&s;t ready to think they can convince others; and are apt to engage in talk with every one they meet with,<HI>almo&s;t</HI> to this End; and when they are di&s;appointed, are ready to wonder that their Rea&s;onings &s;eem to make no more Impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Many fall under &s;uch a Mi&s;take as to be ready to doubt of their good E&s;tate, becau&s;e there was &s;o much u&s;e made of their own Rea&s;on in the Convictions they have receiv'd; they are afraid that they have no Illumina|tion above the natural Force of their own Faculties:
<PB N="44" REF="004239_0352_1004302B70AFC690">
And many make that an Objection again&s;t the Spirituality of their Convictions, that 'tis &s;o ea&s;y to &s;ee Things as they now &s;ee them. They have often heard that Conver&s;ion is a work of mighty Power, manife&s;ting to the Soul what no Man nor Angel can give &s;uch a Conviction of; but it &s;eems to them that the Things that they &s;ee are &s;o plain, and ea&s;y, and rational, that any body can &s;ee them: And if they are enquired of, why they never &s;aw &s;o before; they &s;ay, it &s;eems to them it was becau&s;e they never thought of it. But very often the&s;e Difficulties are &s;oon removed by tho&s;e of another nature; for when God withdraws, they find them&s;elves as it were blind again, they for the pre&s;ent lo&s;e their realizing Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Things that looked &s;o plain to 'em, and by all that they can do they can't recover it, till God renews the Influences of his Spirit.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons after their Conver&s;ion often &s;peak of Things of Religion as &s;eeming <HI>new</HI> to them; that Preaching is a <HI>new</HI> thing; that it &s;eems to them they never heard Preaching before; that the Bible is a <HI>new</HI> Book: They find there <HI>new</HI> Chapters, <HI>new</HI> P&s;alms, <HI>new</HI> Hi&s;tories, becau&s;e they &s;ee them in a new Light. Here was a re|markable In&s;tance of an aged Woman that had &s;pent mo&s;t of her Days under Mr. <HI>Stoddard's</HI> powerful Mi|ni&s;try; who reading in the New Te&s;tament, concerning <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Sufferings for Sinners, &s;eem'd to be &s;urprized and a&s;toni&s;hed at what &s;he read, as at a Thing that was real and very wonderful, but quite <HI>new</HI> to her, in&s;o|much that at fir&s;t, before &s;he had time to turn her Thoughts, &s;he wonder'd within her &s;elf that &s;he had never heard of it before; but then immediately re|collected her &s;elf, and thought that &s;he had often heard of it, and read it, but never till now &s;aw it as a thing real; and then ca&s;t in her Mind, how wonderful this was, that the Son of God &s;hould un|dergo &s;uch things for Sinners, and how &s;he had &s;pent her Time in ungratefully &s;inning again&s;t &s;o good a God, and &s;uch a Saviour; tho' &s;he was a Per&s;on, as to what was vi&s;ible, of a very blamele&s;s and inoffen|&s;ive Life, And &s;he was &s;o overcome by tho&s;e Con&s;ide|rations,

that her Nature was ready to fail under them: Tho&s;e that were about her, and knew not what was the matter, were &s;urprized, and thought &s;he was a dying.</P>
<P>Many have &s;poken much of their Hearts being drawn out in Love to God and <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and their Minds be|ing wrapt up in delightful Contemplation of the Glo|ry, and wonderful Grace of God, and the Excellency, and dying Love of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and of their Souls going forth in longing De&s;ires <HI>after God and Chri&s;t</HI> Se|veral of our young Children have expre&s;&s;ed much of this; and have manife&s;ted a Willingne&s;s to leave Fa|ther and Mother and all Things in the World, to go to be with <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Some Per&s;ons have had longing De&s;ires after <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which have ri&s;en to that degree, as to take away their natural Strength.

Several Per&s;ons have had &s;o great a Sen&s;e of the Glory of God, and Excellency of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that Nature and Life has &s;eemed almo&s;t to &s;ink under it; and in all probability, if God had &s;hewed them a little more of him&s;elf, it would have di&s;&s;olved their Frame. I have &s;een &s;ome, and been in Conver|&s;ation with them in &s;uch Frames, who have certainly been perfectly &s;ober, and very remote from any thing like enthu&s;ia&s;tick Wildne&s;s: And have talk'd, when a|ble to &s;peak, of the Glory of God's Perfections, and the wonderfulne&s;s of his Grace in Chri&s;t, and their own Unworthine&s;s, in &s;uch a manner that can't be per|fectly expre&s;&s;ed after them.

Never, I believe, was &s;o much done in confe&s;&s;ing Injuries, and making up Differences as the la&s;t Year.

<P>There are &s;ome Per&s;ons that I have been acquainted with, but more e&s;pecially two, that belong to other Towns, that have been &s;wallowed up exceedingly with a Sen&s;e of the awful Greatne&s;s and Maje&s;ty of God; and both of them told me to this purpo&s;e, that if they in the time of it, had had the lea&s;t Fear that they were not at at peace with this &s;o great a God, they &s;hould in&s;tantly have died.</P>
<P>It is worthy to be remarked, that &s;ome Per&s;ons by their Conver&s;ion &s;eem to be greatly helped as to their doctrinal Notions of Religion; it was particulary remar|kable in one, who having been taken captive in his Child|hood, was train'd up in <HI>Canada,</HI> in the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Religion; and &s;ome Years &s;ince returned to this his native Place, and was in a mea&s;ure brought off from <HI>Popery:</HI> but &s;eem'd very awkward and dull of receiving any true and clear Notion of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Scheme, till he was convert|ed; and then he was remarkably altered in this re&s;pect.</P>

acts of Grace. But the greater part, as they &s;ometimes fall into dead Frames of Spirit, are frequent|ly exerci&s;ed with Scruples and Fears concerning their Condition.</P>
<P>They generally have an awful Apprehen&s;ion of the Dreadfulne&s;s and undoing Nature of a fal&s;e Hope; and there has been ob&s;ervable in mo&s;t a great Caution, left in giving an account of their Experiences, they &s;hould &s;ay too much, and u&s;e too &s;trong Terms: And many after they have related their Experiences, have been greatly afflicted with Fears, left they have play'd the Hypocrite, and u&s;ed &s;tronger Terms than their Ca&s;e would fairly allow of; and yet could not find how they could correct them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I think that the main ground of the Doubts and Fears that Per&s;ons, after their Conver&s;ion, have been exerci&s;ed with about their own State, has been that they have found &s;o much Corruption remaining in their Hearts. At fir&s;t their Souls &s;eem to be all alive, their Hearts are fixed, and their Affections flowing; they &s;eem to live quite above the World, and meet with but little Difficulty in religious Exerci&s;es; and they are ready to think it will always be &s;o: Tho' they are truly aba&s;ed under a Sen&s;e of their Vilene&s;s by rea&s;on of former Acts of Sin, yet they are not then &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible what Corruption &s;till remains in their Hearts; and therefore are &s;urprized when they find that they begin to be in dull and dead Frames, to be troubled with wandering Thoughts in the time of publick and private Wor&s;hip, and to be utterly unable to keep them&s;elves from 'em; al&s;o when they find them&s;elves unaffected at Sea&s;ons in which, they think there is the greate&s;t Occa&s;ion to be affected; and when they feel worldly Di&s;po&s;itions working in them, and it may be Pride, and Envy, and &s;tirrings of Revenge, or &s;ome ill Spirit towards &s;ome Per&s;on, that has injured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">other workings of indwelling Sin: Their Hearts are almo&s;t &s;unk with the Di&s;appointment, and they are ready pre&s;ently to think that all this they have met with is nothing, and that they are mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hypocrites.</P>

They are ready to argue, that if God had indeed done &s;uch great Things for them, as they hoped, &s;uch In|gratitude would be incon&s;i&s;tent with it: They cry out of the hardne&s;s and wickedne&s;s of their Hearts; and &s;ay there is &s;o much Corruption, that it &s;eems to them <HI>im|po&s;&s;ible that there &s;hould be any Goodne&s;s there:</HI> and many of them &s;eem to be much more &s;en&s;ible how corrupt their Hearts are, than ever they were before they were convert|ed; and &s;ome have been too ready to be impre&s;s'd with Fear, that in&s;tead of becoming better, they are grown much wor&s;e, and make it an Argument again&s;t the Goodne&s;s of their State. But in truth the Ca&s;e &s;eems plainly to be, that now they feel the pain of their own Wound; they have a watchful Eye upon their Hearts, that they don't u&s;e to have: They take more notice what Sin is there, and Sin is now more burden&s;ome to 'em, they &s;trive more a|gain&s;t it, and feel more of the Strength of it.</P>
<P>They are &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd that they &s;hould in this re|&s;pect find them&s;elves &s;o different from the <HI>Idea</HI> that they generally had entertained of godly Per&s;ons; for tho' Grace be indeed of a far more excellent nature than they imagin'd; yet tho&s;e that are godly have much le&s;s of it, and much more remaining Corruption, than they thought. They never realized it, that Per&s;ons were wont to meet with &s;uch Difficulties, after they were once converted. When they are thus exerci&s;ed with Doubts about their State, through the Deadne&s;s of their Frames of Spirit, as long as the&s;e Frames la&s;t, they are commonly unable to &s;atisfy them&s;elves of the Truth of their Grace, by all their Self-examination. When they hear of the Signs of Grace laid down for 'em to try them&s;elves by, they are often &s;o clouded, that they don't know how to apply them: they hardly know whether they have &s;uch and &s;uch things in them or no, and whether they have experienced them or not: That which was &s;weete&s;t, and be&s;t, and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing in their Experiences, they can't recover a &s;en&s;e or <HI>Idea</HI> of. But on a Return of the Influences of the Spirit of God, to revive the lively Actings of Grace, the Light breaks through the Cloud, and Doubting and Darkne&s;s &s;oon vani&s;h away.</P>

Per&s;ons are often revived out of their dead and dark Frames, by religious Conver&s;ation: while they are talk|ing of divine things, <HI>or ever</HI> they are <HI>aware,</HI> their <HI>Souls</HI> are carried away into holy Exerci&s;es with abundant Plea&s;ure. And oftentimes, while they are relating their pa&s;t Experiences to their Chri&s;tian Brethren, they have a fre&s;h &s;en&s;e of them revived, and the &s;ame Experiences in a Degree again renewed. Sometimes while Per&s;ons are exerci&s;ed in Mind with &s;everal Objections again&s;t the Goodne&s;s of their State, they have Scriptures, one after another, coming to their Minds, to an&s;wer their Scruples, and unravel their Difficulties, exceeding appo&s;ite and proper to their Circum&s;tances; by which means their Darkne&s;s is &s;cattered; and often before the Be&s;towment of any new remarkable Comforts, e&s;pecially after long continued Deadne&s;s and ill Frames, there are renewed Humblings, in a great &s;en&s;e of their own exceeding Vilene&s;s and Unworthine&s;s, as before their fir&s;t Comforts were be&s;towed.</P>

<P>But yet the vigorous Exerci&s;e of the Mind, does doubtle&s;s more &s;trongly impre&s;s it with imaginary <HI>Ideas,</HI> in &s;ome than others, which probably may ari&s;e from the dif|ference of Con&s;titution, and &s;eems, evidently in &s;ome, partly to ari&s;e from their peculiar Circum&s;tances: When Per|&s;ons have been exerci&s;ed with extreme Terrors, and there is a &s;udden change to Light and Joy, the Imagina|tion &s;eems more &s;u&s;ceptive of &s;trong <HI>Ideas,</HI> and the inferior Powers, and even the Frame of the Body, is much more affected and wrought upon, than when the &s;ame Per&s;ons have as great &s;piritual Light and Joy afterwards; of which it might, perhaps, be ea&s;y to give a Rea&s;on.

<P>She had long been infirm, and often had been exerci&s;ed with great Pain; but &s;he died chiefly of Famine. It was, doubtle&s;s, partly owing to her bodily Weakne&s;s, that her Nature was &s;o often overcome, and ready to &s;ink with gracious Affection; but yet the truth was, that &s;he had more Grace, and greater Di&s;coveries of God and <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than the pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rail State did well con&s;i&s;t with. She wanted to be where &s;trong Grace might have more Liberty, and be without the Clog of a weak Body; there &s;he longed to be, and there &s;he doubtle&s;s now is. She was looked upon among&s;t us, as a very eminent In&s;tance of Chri&s;tian Experience: but this is but a very broken and imperfect Account I have given of her&punc; Her Eminency would much more appear, if her Ex|periences were fully related, as &s;he was wont to ex|pre&s;s, and manife&s;t them, while living.

not know of it at that time, and were not wont, in the Coun&s;els they gave to their Children, particularly to direct them&s;elves to her, by rea&s;on of her being &s;o young, and as they &s;uppo&s;ed not capable of Under|&s;tanding: but after her Brother had talked to her, they ob&s;erved her very earne&s;tly to li&s;ten to the Advice they gave to the other Children; and &s;he was ob&s;erved very con&s;tantly to retire, &s;everal times in a Day, as was con|cluded, for &s;ecret Prayer; and grew more and more engaged in Religion, and was more frequent in her Clo&s;er; till at la&s;t &s;he was wont to vi&s;it it five or &s;ix times in a Day: and was &s;o engaged in it, that nothing would at any Time divert her from her &s;tated Clo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Exerci&s;es.

<P>She once of her own accord &s;pake of her Un&s;ucce&s;sful|ne&s;s, in that &s;he could not find God, or to that pur|po&s;e.

<P>After the Child had &s;aid this, &s;he retired again into her Clo&s;et; and her Mother went over to her Brother's, who was next Neighbour; and when &s;he came back, the Child, being come out of the Clo&s;et, meets her Mother with this chearful Speech, <HI>I can find God now!</HI> referring to what &s;he had before complain'd of that &s;he could not find God. Then the Child &s;poke again and &s;aid, <HI>I love God!</HI> Her Mother asked her, <HI>how well</HI> &s;he loved God, whether &s;he loved God <HI>better than her Father and Mother,</HI> &s;he &s;aid <HI>yes.</HI> Then &s;he asked her whether &s;he loved God <HI>better than her little Si&s;ter</HI> Rachel?

<P>From this Time there has appeared a very remarkable abiding Change in the Child: She has been very &s;trict upon the Sabbath; and &s;eems to long for the Sabbath Day before it comes&punc; and will often in the Week time be enquiring how long it is to the Sabbath Day, and mu&s;t have the Days particularly counted over that are between, before &s;he will be contented. And &s;he &s;eems to love God's Hou&s;e, is very eager to go thither: Her Mother once asked her why &s;he had &s;uch a mind to go? whether it was not to &s;ee fine Folks? She &s;aid <HI>no, it</HI> was <HI>to hear Mr.</HI> Edwards <HI>preach.</HI> When &s;he is in the place of Wor&s;hip, &s;he is very far from &s;pending her Time there as Children at her Age u&s;ually do, but appears with an Attention that is very extraordinary for &s;uch a Child. She al&s;o appears very de&s;irous at all Oppor|tunities to go to pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">e religious Meetings; and is very &s;till and attentive at Home, in Prayer time, and has ap|peared affected in time of Family Prayer. She &s;eems to delight much in hearing religious Conver&s;ation: When I once was there with &s;ome others that were Strangers, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alked to her &s;omething of Religion, &s;he &s;eemed more than ordinarily attentive; and when we were gone.&s;he looked out very wi&s;tly after us, and &s;aid, <HI>I wi&s;h they wou'd come again!</HI> Her Mother asked her <HI>why:</HI> Says &s;he, <HI>I love to hear 'em talk!</HI></P>
<P>She &s;eems to have very much of the Fear of God before her Eyes&punc; and as extraordinary Dread of Sin again&s;t him; of which her Mother mention'd the fol|lowing remarkable In&s;tance. Some time in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the la&s;t Year, &s;he went with &s;ome bigger Children, to get &s;ome Plumbs, in a Neighbour's Lot, knowing nothing of any harm in what &s;he did, but when &s;he brought &s;ome of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into the Hou&s;e, her Mother mildly reproved her, and told her that &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Plumbs

This &s;till'd her a little while; but pre&s;ently &s;he broke out again into an exceeding Fit of Crying: Her Mother asked her <HI>what</HI> made her <HI>cry again? Why</HI> &s;he cryed <HI>now, &s;ince</HI> they had asked <HI>leave? What</HI> it was that troubled her now? And asked her &s;everal times very earne&s;tly, before &s;he made any An&s;wer; but at la&s;t &s;aid, <HI>it was becau&s;e BECAUSE IT WAS SIN.</HI> She continued a con&s;iderable time cry|ing; and &s;aid &s;he would not <HI>go again if Eunice</HI> asked her <HI>an hundred Times;</HI> and &s;he retain'd her Aver&s;ion to that Fruit for a con&s;iderable time, under the re|membrance of her former Sin.</P>
<P>She at &s;ome times appears greatly affected, and de|lighted with Texts of Scripture that come to her mind. Particularly, about the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> the la&s;t Year, that Text came to her mind, <HI>Rev.</HI> iii.20. <HI>Behold, I &s;tand at the Door and knock: If any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in, and &s;up with him, and he with me.</HI> She &s;poke of it to tho&s;e of the Family, with a great appearance of Joy, a &s;miling Countenance, &amp; Elevation of Voice, and af|terwards &s;he went into another Room, where her Mother overheard her talking very earne&s;tly to the Children about it, and particularly heard her &s;ay to them, three or four times over, with an air of exceeding Joy and Admiration, <HI>Why it is to SUP WITH GOD.</HI> At &s;ome time about the middle of Winter, very late in the Night, when all were a bed, her Mother perceived that &s;he was awake, and heard her, as tho' &s;he was weeping. She
<PB N="71" REF="004239_0379_10043069117592F0">
called to her, and asked her what was the matter. She an&s;wered with a low Voice, &s;o that her Mother could not hear what &s;he &s;aid; but thinking that it might be occa&s;ion'd by &s;ome &s;piritual Affection, &s;aid no more to her; but perceived her to lie awake, and to continue in the &s;ame Frame, for a con&s;iderable time. The next Morning, &s;he asked her whether &s;he did not cry the la&s;t Night: The Child an&s;wered <HI>yes, I did cry a little, for I was thinking about God and Chri&s;t, and they loved me,</HI> Her Mother asked her whether <HI>to think of God and Chri&s;t's loving</HI> her <HI>made</HI> her <HI>cry:</HI> She an&s;wered <HI>yes, it does &s;ome|times.</HI></P>
<P>She has often manife&s;ted a great Concern for the good of others Souls: and has been wont many times affection|ately to coun&s;el the other Children. Once about the lat|ter end of <HI>September,</HI> the la&s;t Year, when &s;he and &s;ome others of the Children where in a Room by them&s;elves, a husking <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, the Child, after a while, came out and &s;at by the Fire. Her Mother took notice that &s;he appeared with a more than ordinary &s;erious and pen&s;ive Countenance, but at la&s;t &s;he broke &s;ilence, and &s;aid, I have been talking to <HI>Nabby</HI> and <HI>Eunice:</HI> Her Mother asked her what &s;he had &s;aid to 'em Why &s;aid &s;he, I <HI>told 'em they mu&s;t pray, and prepare to die,</HI> that they had <HI>but a little while to live in this World, and</HI> they <HI>mu&s;t be always ready</HI> When <HI>Nabby</HI> came out, her Mother asked her whether &s;he had &s;aid that to them. <HI>Yes</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>&s;he &s;aid that, and a great deal more.</HI> At other times, the Child took her Opportunities to talk to the other Children about the great Concern of their Souls, &s;ometimes, &s;o as much to affect them, and &s;et them into Tears. She was once exceeding importunate with her Mother to go with her Si&s;ter <HI>Naomi</HI> to pray: Her Mother endeavoured to put her off; but &s;he pulled her by the Sleeve, and &s;eem'd as if &s;he would by no means be denied. At la&s;t her Mother told her, that <HI>Amy mu&s;t go and pray her &s;elf; but,</HI> &s;ays the Child, <HI>&s;he will not go;</HI> and per|&s;i&s;ted earne&s;tly to beg of her Mother to go with her.</P>
<P>She has di&s;cover'd an uncommon Degree of a Spirit of Charity; particularly on the following Occa&s;ion: A

<P>In the former part of this great Work of God among&s;t us, till it got to its height, we &s;eemed to be wonderfully &s;miled upon and ble&s;&s;ed in all re&s;pects. <HI>Satan</HI> (as has
<PB N="73" REF="004239_0381_100430701636D420">
been already ob&s;erved&punc;) &s;eemed to be unu&s;ually re&s;train'd: Per&s;ons that before had been involved in Melancholy, &s;eemed to be as it were waked up out of it; and tho&s;e that had been entangled with extraordinary Temptations, &s;eemed wonderfully to be &s;et at liberty; and not only &s;o, but it was the mo&s;t remarkable time of Health, that ever I knew &s;ince I have been in the Town. We ordinarily have &s;everal Bills put up, every Sabbath, for Per&s;ons that are &s;ick; but now we had not &s;o much as one for many Sabbaths together. But after this it &s;eemed to be otherwi&s;e, when this Work of God appear'd to be at its greate&s;t Height, a poor weak Man that belongs to the Town, being in great &s;piritual Trouble, was hurried with violent Temptations to cut his own Throat, and made an Attempt; but did not do it effectually. He after this continued a con&s;iderable Time exceeding overwhelmed with Melancholy; but has now of a long time been very greatly deliver'd, by the Light of God's Countenance lifted up upon him, and has expre&s;&s;ed a great Sen&s;e of his Sin in &s;o far yielding to Temptation; and there are in him all hopeful Evidences of his having been made a Subject of &s;aving Mercy.</P>
<P>In the latter part of <HI>May,</HI> it began to be very &s;en&s;ible that the Spirit of God was gradually withdrawing from us, and after this Time <HI>Satan</HI> &s;eemed to be more let loo&s;e, and raged in a dreadful manner. The fir&s;t In&s;tance wherein it appear'd, was a Per&s;on's putting an end to his own Life, by cutting his Throat. He was a Gen|tleman of more than common Under&s;tanding, of &s;trict Morals, religious in his Behaviour, and an u&s;eful ho|nourable Per&s;on in the Town; but was of a Family that are exceeding prone to the Di&s;ea&s;e of Melancholy, and his Mother was killed with it. He had, from the be|ginning of this extraordinary Time, been exceedingly concern'd about the State of his Soul, and there were &s;ome Things in his Experience, that appeared very hope|fully; but he dur&s;t entertain no Hope concerning his own good E&s;tate. Towards the latter part of his Time, he grew much di&s;couraged, and Melancholy grew a|main

upon him, till he was wholly overpower'd by it, and was in great mea&s;ure pa&s;t a Capacity of receiving Advice, or being rea&s;oned with to any purpo&s;e: The Devil took the advantage, and drove him into de&s;pairing Thoughts. He was kept awake a-nights, medi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ating Terror; &s;o that he had &s;carce any Sleep at all, for a long time together. And it was ob&s;erved at la&s;t, that he was &s;carcely well capable of managing his ordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s, and was judged delirious by the Coroner's Inque&s;t. The News of this extraordinarily affected the Minds of People here, and &s;truck them as it were with A&s;toni&s;hment. After this, Multitudes in this, and other Towns, &s;eemed to have it &s;trongly &s;ugge&s;ted to 'em, and pre&s;&s;ed upon 'em, to do as this Per&s;on had done. And many that &s;eemed to be under no Melancholy, &s;ome pious Per&s;ons, that had no &s;pecial Darkne&s;s, or Doubts about the goodne&s;s of their State, nor were under any &s;pecial Trouble or Concern of Mind about any thing Spiritual or Temporal, yet had it urged upon 'em, as if &s;omebody had &s;poke to 'em, <HI>Cut your own Throat, now is a good Opportunity.</HI> Now; now! So that they were oblig'd to fight with all their might to re&s;i&s;t it, and yet no Rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ted to 'em why they &s;hould do it.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, there were two remarkable In&s;tances of Per&s;ons led away with &s;trange Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Delu&s;ions: one at <HI>Suffield,</HI> another at <HI>South-Hadley:</HI> That which has made the greate&s;t noi&s;e in the Country was of the Man at <HI>South-Hadley,</HI> who&s;e Delu&s;ion was, that he thought him&s;elf divinely in&s;tructed to direct a poor Man in melancholy and de&s;pairing Circum&s;tances, to &s;ay certain Words in Prayer to God, as recorded in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> cxvi 4. for his own Relief. The Man is e&s;teemed a pious Man: I have &s;ince this Error of his, had a particular Acquaintance with him; and I believe none would que&s;tion his Piety, that had had &s;uch an Acquain|tance. He gave me a particular Account of the Manner how he was deluded; which is too long to be here in&s;erted. But in &s;hort, he was exceedingly rejoiced and
<PB N="75" REF="004239_0383_10043076B62E6C20">
elevated with this extraordinary Work, &s;o carried on in this part of the Country: and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an Opinion that it was the beginning of the glorious Times of the Church &s;poken of in Scripture: And had read it as the Opinion of &s;ome Divines, that there would be many in the&s;e Times that &s;hould be endued with extraordinary Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, and had embraced the Notion; tho' he had at fir&s;t no Apprehen&s;ions that any be&s;ides Mini&s;ters would have &s;uch Gifts. But he &s;ince exceed|ingly laments the Di&s;honour he has done to God, and the Wound he has given Religion in it, and has lain low before God and Man for it.</P>
<P>After the&s;e things the In&s;tances of Conver&s;ion were rare here in compari&s;on of what they had before been, (tho' that remarkable In&s;tance of the little Child was after this,) and the Spirit of God not long after this time, appear'd very &s;en&s;ibly withdrawing from all parts of the County; (tho' we have heard of its going on in &s;ome Places of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and that it continues to be car|ried on even to this Day.) But Religion remain'd here, and I believe in &s;ome other Places, the main Subject of Conver&s;ation, for &s;everal Months after this. And there were &s;ome Turns, wherein God's Work &s;eem'd &s;omething to revive, and we were ready to hope that all was going to be renewed again: yet in the main there was a gradual Decline of that general, engaged, lively Spirit in Reli|gion, which had been before. Several things have hap|pen'd &s;ince, that have diverted Peoples Minds, and turn'd their Conver&s;ation more to others Affairs, particularly his <HI>Excellency</HI> the Governour's coming up, and the <HI>Com|mittee</HI> of <HI>General Court,</HI> on the Treaty with the <HI>Indians;</HI> and afterwards the <HI>Springfield</HI> Controver&s;y; and &s;ince that, our People in this Town have been engaged in the building of a new Meetting-hou&s;e: and &s;ome other Oc|currences might be mentioned, that have &s;eem'd to have this Effect. But as to tho&s;e that have been thought to be converted among us, in this time, they generally &s;eem to be Per&s;ons, that have had an abiding Change wrought on them: I have had particular acquaintance

with many of them &s;ince, and they generally appear to be Per&s;ons that have a new Sen&s;e of Things, new Apprehen&s;ions and Views of God, of the divine At|tributes, and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and the great Things of the Go&s;pel: They have a new Sen&s;e of the Truth of them, and they affect them in a new manner; tho' it is very far from being always alike with them, neither can they revive a Sen&s;e of things when they plea&s;e. Their Hearts are often touched, and &s;ometimes fill'd, with new Sweetne&s;&s;es and Delights; there &s;eems to be an inward Ardour and burning of Heart that they expre&s;s, the like to which they never experienced before; &s;ometimes, perhaps, occa&s;ioned only by the Mention of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Name, or &s;ome one of the Divine Perfections: There are new Appetites, and a new kind of Breathings and Pantings of Heart, <HI>and Groanings that cannot be uttered.</HI> There is a new kind of inward Labour and Struggle of Soul to|wards Heaven and Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Some that before were very rough in their Temper and Manners, &s;eem to be remarkably fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed and &s;weet|en'd. And &s;ome have had their Souls exceedingly filled, and overwhelmed with Light, Love, and Comfort, long &s;ince the Work of God has cea&s;ed to be &s;o remarkably carried on in a general way: and &s;ome have had much greater Experiences of this nature than they had before. And there is &s;till a great deal of religious Conver&s;ation continued in the Town, among&s;t young and old; a religi|ous Di&s;po&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ion appears to be &s;till maintain'd among&s;t our People, by their upholding frequent private religious Meetings; and all Sorts are generally wor&s;hipping God at &s;uch Meetings, on <HI>Sabbath</HI> Nights, and in the Even|ing after our publick Lecture. Many Children in the Town do &s;till keep up &s;uch Meetings among them&s;elves. I know of no one young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;on in the Town that has returned to former ways of Loo&s;ene&s;s and Extravagancy in any re&s;pect; but we &s;till remain a reformed People, and God has evidently made us a new People.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="004239_0385_1004307AF7A06310">
I can't &s;ay that there has been no In&s;tance of any one Per&s;on that has carried hem&s;elf &s;o, that others &s;hould ju&s;tly be &s;tumbled concerning his Profe&s;&s;ion; nor am I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o vain as to imagine that we han't been mi&s;taken concerning any that we have entertain'd a good Opini|on of, or that there are none pa&s;s among&s;t us for Sheep, that are indeed, Wolves in Sheep's cloathing; who probably may &s;ome time or other di&s;cover them|&s;elves by their Fruit. We are not &s;o <HI>pure,</HI> but that we have great Cau&s;e to be humbled and a&s;ham'd, that we are &s;o <HI>impure;</HI> nor &s;o religious, but that tho&s;e that watch for our Halting, may &s;ee things in us, whence they may take occa&s;ion to reproach us and Religion: but in the main, there has been a great and marvellous Work of Conver&s;ion and Sanctification among the Peo|ple here; and they have paid all due Re&s;pects to tho&s;e who have been ble&s;t of God to be the In&s;truments of it. Both old and young have &s;hewn a Forwardne&s;s to hearken not only to my Coun&s;els, but even to my Re|proofs from the Pulpit.</P>
<P>A great part of the Country have not received the mo&s;t favourable Thoughts of this Affair; and to this day many retain a Jealou&s;y concerning it, and Pre|judice again&s;t it: I have Rea&s;on to think that the mean|ne&s;s and weakne&s;s of the In&s;trument, that has been made u&s;e of in this Town, has prejudiced many again&s;t it; it don't appear to me &s;trange that it &s;hould be &s;o: But yet this Circum&s;tance of this great Work of God, is analogous to other Circum&s;tances of it: God has &s;o ordered the manner of the Work in many Re&s;pects, as very &s;ignal|ly and remarkably to &s;hew it to be his own peculiar and immediate Work, and to &s;ecure the Glory of it wholly to his own Almighty Power, and Sovereign Grace. And whatever the Circum&s;tances and Means have been, and tho' we are &s;o unworthy, yet <HI>&s;o</HI> hath it plea&s;ed God to work! And we are evidently a People ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord! And here, <HI>in this Corner of the World,</HI> God dwells, and manife&s;ts his Glory.</P>

Thus, <HI>Rev. Sir,</HI> I have given a <HI>large</HI> and <HI>particular</HI> Account of this remarkable Affair; and yet, con&s;idering how manifold God's Works have been among&s;t us, that are worthy to be written, 'tis but a very <HI>brief</HI> one. I &s;hould have &s;ent it much &s;ooner, had I not been greatly hindered by Illne&s;s in my Family, and al&s;o in my&s;elf. It is probably, much larger than you <HI>expected,</HI> and it may be than you <HI>would have cho&s;en.</HI> I thought that the Ex|traordinarine&s;s of the Thing, and the innumerable Mi&s;|repre&s;entations which have gone abroad of it, many of which have, doubtle&s;s, reached your Ears, made it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould be particular. But I would leave it entirely with your Wi&s;dom to make what u&s;e of it you think be&s;t, to &s;end a part of it to <HI>England,</HI> or all, or none if you think it not worthy; or otherwi&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of it as you may think mo&s;t for God's Glory, and the Intere&s;t of Religion. If you are plea&s;ed to &s;end any thing to the Rev^d. Dr. <HI>Guy&s;e,</HI> I &s;hould be glad to have it &s;ignify'd to him as my humble De&s;ire, that &s;ince he, and the Con|gregation to which he preach'd have been plea&s;ed to take &s;o much notice of us, as they have, that they would al&s;o think of us at the Throne of Grace, and &s;eek there for us, that God would not for&s;ake us, but enable us to bring forth Fruit an&s;werable to our Profe&s;&s;ion, and our Mercies, and that our <HI>Light may &s;hine before Men, that others &s;eeeing our good Works, may glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>When I fir&s;t heard of the Notice the Rev^d. Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> and Dr. <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> took of God's Mercies to us, I took occa&s;ion to inform our Congregation of it in a Di&s;|cour&s;e from the&s;e Words; <HI>A City that is &s;et upon an Hill cannot be bid.</HI> And having &s;ince &s;een a particular Ac|count of the Notice the Rev^d Dr. <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> and the Con|gregation he preached to, took of it, in a Letter you wrote to my Honoured Uncle <HI>Williams,</HI> I read that part of your Letter to the Congregation, and labour'd as much as in me lay to enforce their Duty from it. The Congregation were very &s;en&s;ibly moved and affected at both times.</P>
