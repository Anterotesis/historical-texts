<Q><HI>I had fainted, unle&s;s I had believed to &s;ee the goodne&s;s of the Lord in the Land of the living; wait on the Lord: Be of good Courage, and be &s;hall &s;trengthen thine Heart: Wait I &s;ay on the Lord.</HI></Q>

<P>A DAY much to be remembered is that, which we are this afternoon met toge|ther here in God's hou&s;e, religiou&s;ly to commemorate; yea a day never to be forgotten. It will be handed down to our po&s;terity, of the late&s;t generations, what occured at LEXINGTON, upon the <HI>Nineteenth</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> 1775.</P>
<P>FIVE pa&s;&s;ing years, have not in the lea&s;t era&s;ed from our minds the memory of that bloo|dy and murderous &s;cene, here began and &s;ince carried on by <HI>George's</HI> troops in our land.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016873_0004_0F9EC0FFA25AFF88">
IT is &s;till fre&s;h in our minds, what feelings we had when the thunder of war fir&s;t bur&s;t forth upon us, and our friends here fell a &s;acrifice to enraged malice. We are men, and can recol|lect what a ferment our blood and &s;pirits were in, when we who were at a di&s;tance before the ri&s;ing of that morning &s;un, received the ti|dings of your &s;ad fate, and garments rolled in blood. It flew as it were upon the wings of the wind. The fir&s;t report was, that one third part of the town had fallen before the enemy. Ble&s;&s;ed be God it did not prove true.</P>
<P>WE heard the calling to arms with &s;urprize, yet with re&s;olution by God's help, to &s;tand forth in the defence of the land, and repel force with force.</P>
<P>THE great &s;uperintendant of the world, cau|&s;ed the arrows of his quiver to enter into our reins&mdash;we were filled with bitterne&s;s&mdash;our &s;oul was removed far off from peace&mdash;we forgot pro&s;perity. At this day we remember our afflic|tion and mi&s;ery, the worm wood and the gall. Our &s;oul hath them &s;till in remembrance, and is humbled in us.</P>
<P>WE had fainted, unle&s;s we had believed to &s;ee the goodne&s;s of the Lord in the land of the living.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;upported us, was the goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e. That the Lord would not ca&s;t off forever, but though he cau&s;e grief, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> will have compa&s;&s;ion, according to the mul|titude
<PB N="7" REF="016873_0005_0F9EC0FFC3BCAA40">
of his tender mercies. For he doth not afflict willingly, or grieve the children of men. And though clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him; yet ju&s;tice and judgment are the habitation of his throne; for the judge of all the earth can do nothing but right.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of our thoughts within us, we were able to &s;ay, let God be judge.</P>
<P>TO heaven we appealed as the protector of his people, and avenger of the injured.&mdash;we were ready to adopt the language of Joab&mdash;be of good courage, and let us behave our&s;elves valiantly, for our people, and for the cities of our God, and let the Lord do that which is good in his &s;ight.</P>
<P>THE enemy, as if it was a thing plea&s;ing to them to di&s;lodge &s;ouls, and had received the di&s;po&s;ition of their minds from him who was a murderer from the beginning, and is called the great enemy of God, upon the &s;hedding the fir&s;t blood, were ready to give their &s;hout. But the triumphing of the wicked was &s;hort.</P>
<P>THEIR march was &s;oon ob&s;tructed and their retreat became nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;In a very few hours their huzza's, their laughter was turned into mourning, by the fall of many of their party, and the groans and cries of the wounded. A ju&s;t puni&s;hment of the murder they had com|mitted in the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016873_0006_0F9EC1008303AAE0">
THE day indeed was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to us, and will be related as &s;uch to the children yet un|born. But God was with us to uphold us.&mdash;"If it had not been the Lord who was on our &s;ide, then may I&s;rael &s;ay; if it had not been the Lord who was on our &s;ide, when men ro&s;e up again&s;t us; then they had &s;wallowed us quick, when their wrath was kindled again&s;t us."</P>
<P>OUR hope was in the living God&punc; who made heaven and earth. Who graciou&s;ly appeared for us that day, as he has ever &s;ince done, through the cour&s;e of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war. God was our refuge, a pre&s;ent help in trouble. He has been with us to conduct us in dark and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing times. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael, who hath not given us a prey to the enemy.</P>
<P>MY brother who came before me, and was your remembrancer the la&s;t year, then mention|ed a variety of in&s;tances, wherein the Lord hath helped us, how his power and goodne&s;s have been very con&s;picuous. I may now this day re|peat it and &s;ay, "hitherto hath the Lord helped us," and can only add at this time, that it was our belief in the divine government, which &s;up|ported and kept us from &s;inking in the &s;ea of trouble, God in his righteous and wi&s;e provi|dence has called us to pa&s;s through.&mdash;We may well join with David in the languague of our text and &s;ay, I had fainted, unle&s;s I had believed, to &s;ee the goodne&s;s of the Lord in the land of the living&mdash;and receive his excellent advice and
<PB N="9" REF="016873_0007_0F9EC1014CB93F78">
coun&s;el&mdash;wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he &s;hall &s;trengthen thine heart, wait I &s;ay on the Lord.</P>
<P>From the words of our text we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>THAT faith and tru&s;t in the government of divine providence, is the great &s;upport of God's people in the mo&s;t perilous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing times.</P>
<P>FIRST. IT may be particularly con&s;idered, that the people of God, when pre&s;&s;ed with &s;ore troubles and difficulties, &s;tand in need of &s;upport, and a place of refuge to flee unto. And</P>
<P>SECONDLY. I &s;hall &s;how how faith in the providence of God &s;upports the &s;oul, in pre&s;&s;ing troubles and difficulties.</P>
<P>I. THE people of God, when pre&s;&s;ed with &s;ore troubles, &s;tand in need of &s;upport, and a place of refuge to flee unto. Agreeable to the P&s;al|mi&s;t; in God &s;ays he, is my &s;alvation, and my glory; the rock of my &s;trength, and my refuge is in God&mdash;tru&s;t in him at all times ye peo|ple&mdash;God is a refuge for us. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 62, 7, 8.</P>
<P>The providences of God are promi&s;cuou&s;ly di&s;pen&s;ed to the children of men here in this &s;tate. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of the righteous, is not always upon him, or the wickedne&s;s of the wick|ed upon him in this world. But the righteous is often exerci&s;ed with adver&s;ity and trouble, and the wicked flouri&s;h in earthly pro&s;perity. By
<PB N="10" REF="016873_0008_0F9EC102A61A97C8">
this means men are properly in a &s;tate of trial and probation, and their final &s;tate to be deter|mined according to their conduct and behaviour here. The goodne&s;s of God does not always lead men to repentance and engage them to fide|lity in his &s;ervice; nor is the righteous at all times overwhelmed with adver&s;ity. Both pro&s;|perity and adver&s;ity ought to be &s;o improved by us, as to excite us to acknowledge God as the di&s;pen&s;er of them.</P>
<P>IT is the wicked man's crime to be unmindful of the divine goodne&s;s, and attribute his &s;ucce&s;&s;es to his own wi&s;dom and indu&s;try. And it argues great di&s;tru&s;t in the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of pro|vidence, for the righteous man to be overwhel|med in the day of trouble and adver&s;ity, becau&s;e he may be &s;ure God can bring him out of trou|ble, and has declared all things &s;hall work toge|ther for good, to &s;uch as love God, and make con&s;cience of walking in obedience to his com|mands. Becau&s;e the righteous &s;tand in great need of &s;upport in the day when troubles pre&s;s hard upon him, therefore God has &s;aid, call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou &s;hall glorify me.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to man's pre&s;ent &s;tate in this world, that there &s;hould be &s;ome|thing for him to lean upon, and have recour&s;e unto as his &s;upport and refuge. "Every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate, is but a feeble, infirm creature; what from the weakne&s;s of his own mind, the
<PB N="11" REF="016873_0009_0F9EC103463C34E8">
di&s;order of his own pa&s;&s;ions from within"; to|gether with all that train of evils he &s;hall una|voidably meet withal from without, "the great ob&s;curity which there is in the nature of things, that uncertainty which attends the i&s;&s;ues and events of them; the mutability of all human affairs" and the impo&s;&s;ibility of providing again&s;t all events that may po&s;&s;ibly come to pa&s;s: from the&s;e con&s;iderations it appears, that to believe in the goodne&s;s of God and hope in his mercy, are altogether nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;tate of men in this world, and they mu&s;t always be in an un&s;afe, unquiet condition&punc; unle&s;s they have &s;omewhat to &s;upport and relieve them in their &s;traits and difficulties. "Our conditions in this world are often in &s;cripture repre&s;ented by a &s;tate of war|fare, wherein the virtues of faith and hope, are &s;aid to be our brea&s;tplate, our &s;hield, and our helmet, the chief defen&s;ive army, whereby we are to be guarded again&s;t all a&s;&s;aults. And &s;ome|times by a &s;tate travelling by &s;ea, wherein hope is our anchor, that which mu&s;t fix and keep us &s;teady in the mid&s;t of all &s;torms." Which hope we have, &s;ays the apo&s;tle "as an anchor of the &s;oul, both &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t". As the anchor is to &s;ecure the &s;hip from da&s;hing again&s;t the rocks when the tempe&s;t ari&s;es, &s;o a firm belief in the goodne&s;s of God keeps the &s;oul of the &s;aint from being overwhelmed when troubles and afflictions &s;urround him. How di&s;tre&s;&s;ing would be the con|dition of many a one, did they not believe there was a God, that governed the world and ordered all events? How would they &s;ink down into the
<PB N="12" REF="016873_0010_0F9EC103844B9430">
depths of de&s;pair, were they not &s;ure God was able to bring them out of the furnace of afflicti|on, and had declared he was ever ready to hear the cries of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>SUCH is the &s;tate of things in this world, that adver&s;ity will unavoidably be the portion of ma|ny of the children of men. And at times &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es as &s;eem almo&s;t un&s;urmountable, but this keeps up the &s;pirits of the righteous, that God governs the world, and can bring good out of evil, and order out of confu&s;ion&mdash;can &s;o over|rule men's minds and order events, as finally to promote his own glory, and the good of his peo|ple.&mdash;Which brings me to the &s;econd general head of my di&s;cour&s;e at this time.&mdash;namely,</P>
<P>II. To &s;how how faith in the providence of God, &s;upports the &s;oul in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing troubles and difficulties. I had fainted, &s;ays David in our text, unle&s;s I had believed to &s;ee the goodne&s;s of the Lord in the land of the living.</P>
<P>ALL the divine attributes unite to render God amiable in the &s;ight of the chri&s;tian, and excite faith and confidence in him. He that really believes God to be what is declared of him in the &s;acred oracles, the wi&s;e, holy, and good go|vernor of the world, will derive &s;upport from him in pre&s;&s;ing troubles. Becau&s;e he knows &s;uch a Being will provide for, and take care of his people, &s;o that nothing &s;hall befall them but what &s;hall eventually terminate for their good,
<PB N="13" REF="016873_0011_0F9EC10464243280">
provided they live in the di&s;charge of their own duty. Particularly I may &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE chri&s;tian firmly confides in the wi&s;|dom of divine government, and is hence &s;uppor|ted, under the troubles and perplexities attending this frail &s;tate.</P>
<P>THIS is expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted in the holy &s;crip|tures, the Lord is a God of knowledge and by him actions are weigh'd; and &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, his under&s;tanding is infinite. He is perfectly acquainted with our condition and circum&s;tances in the world. Whatever difficulties we may be in, he knows how to extricate us out of them. If we are &s;eeking to obtain that which will be hurtful to us, he knows how to di&s;appoint us. Are we in want of real nece&s;&s;aries, he can ea&s;ily devi&s;e means to relieve us, and often times makes provi&s;ion for his people in ways unknown to us, and often beyond all human expectation. We have &s;een it verified in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent war. We have fought our enemies with their own weapons which God has put into our hands. Are we in fear and tremble at impending evils, &s;eeing no way to e&s;cape? His infinite wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding can in&s;tantly find out, and open a way for us to be &s;et at liberty, and avoid the thing we &s;o much &s;eared. In a word, he can al&s;o di&s;appoint us in our enterpri&s;es, when he &s;ees the accompli&s;hment of them will not be be&s;t for us. So that as the wi&s;e man has &s;aid, "the race &s;hall not be to the &s;wift, nor the battle
<PB N="14" REF="016873_0012_0F9EC1050F4C2EF8">
to the &s;trong, neither yet bread to the wi&s;e, nor yet riches to men of under&s;tanding, nor yet fa|vour to men of &s;kill; "for as he &s;ays, <HI>'Prov.</HI> 21, 30. There is no wi&s;dom nor under&s;tanding nor coun&s;el again&s;t the Lord; the hor&s;e is prepared again&s;t the day of battle, but &s;afety is of the Lord. There are many devices he tells us in a man's heart, neverthele&s;s the coun&s;el of the Lord that &s;hall &s;tand." This is a &s;ufficient rea|&s;on why the chri&s;tian &s;hould place his hope and confidence in God. This yields him mighty &s;upport in the day of trouble, that God infinitely wi&s;e governs the world, knows what it be&s;t for us, and can project ways for the effecting it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The chri&s;tian is a&s;&s;ured God is boundle&s;s in his goodne&s;s, love and grace to men, therefore ever ready to help and relieve them.</P>
<P>THIS begets a &s;trong confidence in him, and calms the mind in the day of adver&s;ity. The P&s;almi&s;t has declared that "God is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all". He is ever friendly and beneficent to his creatures.</P>
<P>EARTHLY friends may leave and for&s;ake us, but God will never for&s;ake &s;uch as place their confidence in him upon the principles of reli|gion. Solomon has told us, a friend loveth at all times. A true friend loveth in all &s;tates and conditions, and a brother is born for adver&s;ity. And there is a friend that &s;ticketh clo&s;er than a brother. God is &s;uch a one. And for the &s;ame
<PB N="15" REF="016873_0013_0F9EC105C34305A0">
rea&s;on others for&s;ake us, will God &s;tand by to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t us. Others for&s;ake us, becau&s;e we are in trouble and adver&s;ity, and &s;ome pains and care are nece&s;&s;ary in order to yield us relief. God &s;ees our need and is ready to help, becau&s;e we are in trouble. He has told us to repair to him in this ca&s;e.&mdash;This is the argument he al|lows us to make u&s;e of to prevail with him to ari&s;e for our help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 22, 11. "Be not far from me for trouble is near; for there is none to help.&mdash;"Bow down thine ear O Lord, hear me for I am poor and needy&mdash;pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me; for thou art my &s;trength, into thine hand I commit my &s;pirit." "That which among men, &s;ays one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Wilkings.</NOTE> is u&s;ually the chief occa&s;ion to take off their affection and kindne&s;s, namely mi&s;ery and affliction, is a principal argument to entitle us to the favour of God, and therefore is fre|quently made u&s;e of by good men in holy &s;crip|ture to that purpo&s;e." That God is the helper of the fatherle&s;s, will regard the cries of the afflicted, and is nigh unto all them that call upon him, is a powerful argument why we &s;hould ever place our tru&s;t and confidence in him. This keeps the &s;oul from de&s;pondency in the day of affliction, &s;upplies it with needed &s;trength, and keeps the mind &s;teady in the way God directs. The con&s;ideration of the divine attributes elevates our &s;oul, and encourages us to per&s;evere. But how &s;ad is the &s;tate of that &s;oul, who can have no hope in God, when troubles &s;urround him.
<PB N="16" REF="016873_0014_0F9EC106F2DF73E8">
What perplexities does he feel? what angui&s;h takes hold of him? This was the &s;upport of the P&s;almi&s;t in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing day, that though God &s;hould hide his face from him, yet he would be|lieve he &s;hould' ere long &s;ee of his goodne&s;s in the land of the living. This was Paul's lan|guague, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1, 3, 4. "Ble&s;&s;ed be God, even the father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who com|forteth us in all our tribulations, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trou|ble, by the comfort where-with we our&s;elves are comforted of God."</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT God is matchle&s;s in his power and able to do every thing he &s;ees will be be&s;t for his creatures, is a mighty &s;upport to the be|lieving &s;oul in the day of adver&s;ity. I know &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, "that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all Gods. What&s;oever the Lord plea&s;ed, that did he in Heaven, and in Earth, in the &s;eas, and all deep places." Becau&s;e it is God that giveth power to the &s;aint; and to them that have no might he increa&s;eth &s;trength, there|fore &s;hould we hope in his mercy, and place our confidence in his almighty arm.</P>
<P>THIS was the prophet's language, "tru&s;t ye in the Lord forever: For in the Lord Jehovah is everla&s;ting &s;trength." He is the rock of ages, able to &s;ave at all times, and out of all troubles. Accordingly is called "the hope of I&s;rael, and the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble". He is
<PB N="17" REF="016873_0015_0F9EC107636A6030">
the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the &s;ea. This is a nece&s;&s;ary qualification in that Being in whom we place our confidence, that he is one who is able to help us, and this ability is truly in God, and in him alone. In vain is &s;alvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains; truly in the Lord our God, &s;ays the Prophet, is the &s;alvation of I&s;rael, Jer. 3, 23. Thus the P&s;almi&s;t profe&s;&s;es his faith in the power and pro|vidence of God; truly my &s;oul waiteth upon God; from him cometh my &s;alvation. He is able to help and deliver me. It is as if he &s;aid, I am fully convinced I have no rea&s;on to hope for de|liverance but from God, no arm of fle&s;h is &s;uffi|cient, it mu&s;t come from the Lord. He only is my rock and my &s;alvation&mdash;He is my defence. Ready to e&s;pou&s;e my cau&s;e. None el&s;e are able if they were willing. For &s;urely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity. Hence he cautions men again&s;t placing their confidence in &s;uch as will di&s;appoint them. Put not your tru&s;t in princes, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom is no help, his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h.</P>
<P>HAPPY is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, who&s;e hope is in the Lord his God: which made heaven and earth, the &s;ea and all that therein is. The prophet I&s;aiah al&s;o is as particular and full in his coun&s;el and advice,
<PB N="18" REF="016873_0016_0F9EC108D5129F70">
Cea&s;e ye from man, who&s;e breath is in his no&s;|trils; for wherein is he to be accounted off. Don't depend upon any creature, but place your confidence in God&mdash;He is the only Being, that can help and &s;ave us; for he is the orderer of all events. Therefore it is &s;aid, <HI>Job</HI> 34, 29. When he giveth quietne&s;s, who then can make trouble And when he hideth his face, who then can be|hold him? Whether it be done again&s;t a nation, or again&s;t a man only.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHAT adds greatly to the &s;upport of the &s;uffering and afflicted &s;aint is this, that God is unchangeable, ever remains the fame, in wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s, therefore may always be confided in.</P>
<P>As goodne&s;s is e&s;&s;ential to the divine nature, &s;o this is a &s;trong ground of hope. Was God all ju&s;tice, then nothing could be expected from him, by any fallen creature, but &s;everity of wrath. But he has proclaimed his name, the Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful, &amp;c. And there is forgivene&s;s with him, that he may be &s;eared. It is an argument, why he &s;hould be had in the greate&s;t reverence, becau&s;e he is &s;o good, gracious and compa&s;&s;ionate, and never chan|ges. This is the divine rea&s;oning, <HI>Malachi</HI> 3, 6. I am the Lord, I change not, therefore the &s;ons of Jacob are not con&s;umed; as if he had &s;aid, were it not for my unchangeable nature, the chil|dren of men would be in mi&s;erable circum&s;tances Since my long-&s;uffering changeth not, they are

<P>EARTHLY friends may make great prote&s;tati|ons of kindne&s;s and friend&s;hip, and our expecta|tions may be rai&s;ed; but how &s;uddenly may their minds be changed, their conduct altered, and we &s;uddenly di&s;appointed?

<P>BUT God is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting, the &s;ame ye&s;terday to day and forever. With him there is no variablene&s;s, neither &s;hadow of turning; therefore does the prophet &s;ay, ble&s;&s;ed is the man that tru&s;teth in the Lord, and who&s;e hope the Lord is. "For he &s;hall be as a tree plant|ed by the waters, and that &s;preadeth out her roots by the river, and &s;hall not &s;ee when heat cometh: But her leaf &s;hall be green and &s;hall not be careful in the year of drought, neither &s;hall cea&s;e from yielding fruit." Seeing God is immutable, the children of men may &s;afely con|fide in him, and at all times make him their re|fuge. Says the prophet, therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be, exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: For the Lord is a God of judgment; ble&s;&s;ed are all they that wait for him. And &s;ays David in our text&punc; wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and he &s;hall &s;trengthen thine heart; wait I &s;ay on the Lord. The P&s;almi&s;t

Our fathers &s;ays he, tru&s;ted in thee, O thou that inhabite&s;t the prai&s;es of I&s;rael; they tru&s;ted, and thou did&s;t deliver them, they cried unto thee, and were delivered&mdash;they tru&s;ted in thee, and were not confound|ed&mdash;Thou ha&s;t made me to hope&mdash;Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh&mdash;Ye that fear the Lord, prai&s;e him; all ye &s;eed of Jacob glorify him; and fear him all ye &s;eed of I&s;rael.

<P>THUS I have laid before you, in a very imper|fect manner, the &s;cripture grounds and encourage|ment, for faith and tru&s;t in the government of divine providence, and been able to do little be|&s;ides &s;tiring up your minds by way of remem|brance.</P>
<P>What remains now is by way of application.</P>
<P>WE may hence &s;ee, it is not only the duty, but the greate&s;t happine&s;s of men, to place their hope and confidence in God, under pre&s;&s;ing difficulties.</P>

With great propriety it may be &s;aid, God's re|lation to us, and ours to him, make it our duty to tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P>As God is our Creator, we are to acknowledge him as &s;uch&mdash;as he at fir&s;t gave us our being, &s;o he alone can maintain it, therefore we are to confide in him.</P>
<P>As God is the fountain of all good, &s;o to him, we are to make our addre&s;&s;es for all we need.</P>
<P>FOR a man to neglect God, is really to di&s;|pi&s;e his own happine&s;s; at lea&s;t not con&s;ider where it is to be placed.</P>
<P>HE that does not acknowledge God, as the great governor of the world, the orderer of all events, the be&s;tower of all good, may be &s;aid to live without God. He is expo&s;ed to that cen|&s;ure, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17, 5. Thus &s;aith the Lord, cur&s;ed be the man that tru&s;teth in man, and maketh fle&s;h his arm, and who&s;e heart departeth from the Lord.</P>
<P>GOD is a Being every way fit to be tru&s;ted in, infinite in his wi&s;dom, almighty in his pow|er, boundle&s;s in his goodne&s;s, and unchangeable in his nature. Ever ready to hear the &s;upplicati|ons of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people, and grant them re|lief.</P>

the &s;aints, that it is not only the duty, but the greate&s;t felicity of man, to have his hope placed in God, when perilous times ari&s;e. They that tru&s;t in the Lord, &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, &s;hall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abi|deth forever. As the mountains are round about Jeru&s;alem, &s;o the Lord is round about his people, to defend and &s;uccour them, and be&s;tow all needed ble&s;&s;ings, as his wi&s;dom &s;ees meet. God's covenant and promi&s;e, &s;hall never fail any of the children of men. All things here below may be changed, and fail, but God will &s;till abide the &s;ame to his people; and they may truly &s;ay, in the Lord Jehovah is everla&s;ting &s;trength; therefore will we tru&s;t in him. Tho' wars and tumults ari&s;e, yet we will not be di&s;|mayed with fear and anxiety, at what may come to pa&s;s. On the divine word we will re&s;t, which, &s;ays God, is our refuge and &s;trength, a very pre|&s;ent help in trouble; therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried away into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea. Though every thing may &s;eem to be in a great confu&s;ion, yet there is a river, the &s;treams whereof &s;hall make glad the city of God. There is a God, that is over and above all, who guides the affairs of this lower world. God is in the mid&s;t of his church, &s;he &s;hall not be moved: God &s;hall help her, and that right early. In his own good time, he will ari&s;e and make bare his arm, &s;hew his marvellous power, and his enemies &s;hall be &s;cattered. The heathen may

<P>WE are a&s;&s;ured what great things God has done for &s;uch as have tru&s;ted in him. He has never failed to free them out of their troubles, let them be of what &s;ort &s;oever, or their ca&s;e ever &s;o difficult. Let the circum&s;tances of a people be ever &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, or calamity nigh, God is able to devi&s;e means for their help, and open a way for their deliverance. To the upright there &s;hall ari&s;e light in darkne&s;s. We &s;ee with great pro|priety David might &s;ay to his &s;oul in a day of pre&s;&s;ing troubles, and encourage him&s;elf in God, as in the text; wait on the Lord, O my &s;oul, be of good courage, and he &s;hall &s;trengthen thine heart; wait I &s;ay on the Lord.
