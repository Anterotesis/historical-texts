<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE great object of education, in general, is to unfold, direct and engage, the various faculties of the understanding; and when these views are obtained, the Tutors of Youth, may, without blame, rest satisfied. Not so, however, their parents, their present friends, or their future connections. Talents, science and erudition, however brilliant, important or lucrative, must still, to those with whom we live and associate, be but secondary considerations. The comforts of life cannot spring from these sources, though they consti|tute its refinements; they will not make the character endearing, though they may render it illustrious.&mdash;Domestic happiness has its basis in the temper, and every social virtue its origin in the heart. To form or improve these, in the earlier stages of reflection and observation, is the intention and design of every part of this instructive and pleasing work.</HI></P>

<HEAD>VISIT FOR A WEEK.</HEAD>
<P>CLARA and William were the &s;on and daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Clement: Clara, who was her mother's darling, had &s;carcely attained her tenth year, when &s;he was in|troduced to the card table, and to every place of fa&s;hionable re&s;ort, at which it was po&s;&s;ible to intrude a child of her age: In con&s;equence, &s;he grew confident and vain; pretended to give her opinion on every &s;ub|ject; and was con&s;idered by all as a pert, conceited, di&s;agreeable child: Some pitied&mdash;others laughed at her folly&mdash;but Mrs. Clement being generally known to po&s;&s;e&s;s that mi&s;taken &s;ort of partiality, which ren|dered her blind to the imperfections of her children, no one ventured to reprove, or point them out. The time thus allotted to plea&s;ure, little remained for &s;tudy; that little was divided between dancing and mu|&s;ic, while the knowledge of her own lan|guage, French, Geography, and other e&s;|&s;ential branches of education, where little attended to, if not wholly neglected. A
<PB N="2" REF="030966_0005_0FEA0C41E19E23E0">
cour&s;e of life &s;o improper for her age, na|turally brought along with it other incon|veniencies; her con&s;titution &s;uffered; the ro&s;es fled her cheeks, and Mrs. Clement too late di&s;covered the ill con&s;equence of her imprudence; &s;he wi&s;hed to correct the er|rors &s;he had committed in her education; but found it difficult to aboli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem &s;he had &s;o long countenanced. How far her endeavours had &s;ucceeded is uncertain, as &s;he was unexpectedly &s;eized with a com|plaint of which &s;he died in a few weeks.</P>
<P>Clara was at fir&s;t incon&s;olable, but a &s;hort time di&s;&s;ipated her grief, and her reli&s;h for plea&s;ure returned: &s;he was then continual|ly teizing her father to take her to the play&mdash;to let her go to Mi&s;s &s;uch a one's ball&mdash;and the more her wi&s;hes were gratified the more unrea&s;onable they grew. Mr. Clement in vain expo&s;tulated, it was all to no purpo&s;e; Clara thought only of con&s;ult|ing her own inclinations, and Mr. Clement had too long accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to yield to them.</P>
<P>The Mid-&s;ummer holidays, at length, brought William, who had for three years pa&s;t, been fixed at a boarding-&s;chool &s;ome miles di&s;tant, home, for the vacation. He was a &s;prightly good natured boy, two years younger than his &s;i&s;ter, who had ju&s;t enter|ed her fourteenth. Till his departure for
<PB N="3" REF="030966_0006_0FEA0C44C97D5240">
&s;chool, like her, he had been much indulg|ed, and his education neglected, but &s;ince that time he had been kept to his &s;tudies, and his improvements had equalled, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the expectations of his friends.</P>
<P>Ab&s;ence and the lo&s;s they had mutually &s;u&s;tained in their mother, increa&s;ed the af|fection Clara and her brother, notwith|&s;tanding they &s;ometimes differed when to|gether, entertained for each other; nothing therefore could be more grateful to either than this meeting.</P>
<P>William had been at home three days, when Mr. Clement one morning told them with a &s;mile, they judged the prelude to &s;omething agreeable, that they had an ex|cur&s;ion in contemplation, which he doubt|ed not would give them plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Clara eagerly enquired to what place? but her countenance, which had the mo|ment before been enlivened with &s;miles, was in&s;tantly clouded, when Mr. Clement replied&mdash;To her aunt Mills', in Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire. This lady was the widow of an of|ficer: Upon the death of her hu&s;band, with whom &s;he &s;eemed to have buried all earthly happine&s;s, but that which aro&s;e from retirement and the practice of virtue, had withdrawn to the family man&s;ion-hou&s;e, where, &s;ecluded from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of life, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed her time in acts of cha|rity
<PB N="4" REF="030966_0007_0FEA0C466F92FC50">
and devotion, and, excepting the vi|&s;its &s;he occa&s;ionally paid to a few neigh|bouring families, enjoyed a &s;olitude almo&s;t perpetual. The different ta&s;tes and pur|&s;uits of this lady and Mrs. Clement, toge|ther with &s;ome &s;light mi&s;under&s;tandings, had for &s;ome years di&s;united the families; but a few months before the death of Mrs. Clement the intimacy had been renewed. Clara and William had not, however, yet been introduced to their aunt, of who&s;e character, from her attachment to retire|ment, they had formed no very favourble idea: the vi&s;it was in con&s;equence not agree|able to either.</P>
<P>Mr. Clement ob&s;erved it, but without &s;eeming to do &s;o, continued: "I have for &s;ome time pa&s;t wi&s;hed to introduce you to my &s;i&s;ter; bu&s;ine&s;s opportunately now calls me into Worce&s;ter&s;hire; I &s;hall therefore drop you in my way, and call for you on my return."</P>
<P>Clara looked di&s;concerted, and enquired with earne&s;tne&s;s, "how long they were to &s;tay?"</P>
<P>"My bu&s;ine&s;s will detain me," &s;aid Mr. Clement, "about a week."</P>
<P>"A week!" interrupted Clara, "are we to &s;tay a week?"</P>
<P>"If I may judge by your countenance and manners, Clara," &s;aid Mr. Clement,
<PB N="5" REF="030966_0008_0FEA0C49C1B23C10">
"the vi&s;it I purpo&s;e does not meet your ap|probation; is a week &s;o long a time to pa&s;s with an amiable woman and your father's &s;i&s;ter?"</P>
<P>"But papa, it will be &s;o dull; I have heard you &s;ay that my aunt keeps no com|pany; and you know my brother &s;hould have a little plea&s;ure in the holidays."</P>
<P>William echoed the &s;entiments of his &s;i&s;|ter, and joined in entreating his father to defer the vi&s;it, and let them continue in town during his ab&s;ence. All, however would not do; Mr. Clement, contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, with&s;tood the &s;olicitations of his children, and notwith&s;tanding all they could &s;ay, remained inflexible.</P>
<P>"And when are we to go," a&s;ked Clara, peevi&s;hly?</P>
<P>"I de&s;ign to &s;et out to-morrow morn|ing," &s;aid Mr. Clement; "and expect that you will both attend me with cheerful coun|tenances."</P>
<P>Clara finding it in vain to argue the point, was &s;ilent; but it was evident from her countenance, that this acquie&s;cence with her father's commands was le&s;s agreeable to her, than as a dutiful child, it ought to have been.</P>
<P>As for William, who had made his ob|jections rather out of compliment to his &s;i&s;ter, than from any di&s;like to the journey,
<PB N="6" REF="030966_0009_0FEA0C4D137984F8">
he pre&s;ently re&s;umed his cheerfulne&s;s, but Clara retired in a very ill humour to give orders for the packing her clothes.</P>
<P>"Pray Mi&s;s," &s;aid Betty, under&s;tanding &s;he was going to vi&s;it her aunt Mills, "how long may you be going to &s;tay."</P>
<P>"Longer than I like, I a&s;&s;ure you, Bet|ty," &s;aid the young lady; "my papa is de|termined we &s;hall &s;tay a week."</P>
<P>"A week Mi&s;s" exclaimed Betty, who &s;aw by this, her young mi&s;tre&s;s was not plea&s;ed with the journey, "why you will be moped to death; I wonder my ma&s;ter can think of taking you to &s;uch <HI>an out of the way place!"</HI></P>
<P>"We &s;hall have a melancholy time in|deed," &s;aid Clara, "but there is no &s;aying any thing to papa; I never knew him &s;o ob&s;tinate in my life."</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure," &s;aid Betty, "madam Mills is a very charitable good lady; but la mi&s;s, you will be tired to death; they &s;ay &s;he does nothing from morning till night but read the bible and &s;ay her prayers."</P>
<P>"And do you think that is true?" &s;aid Clara, in a tone of voice that rather en|couraged than checked the impertinence of her &s;ervant.</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure I do," &s;aid Betty; "why madam Mills, they &s;ay, mi&s;s, has never been in London, &s;ince the death of the co|lonel,
<PB N="7" REF="030966_0010_0FEA0C4EC2770AE0">
but once, and that was, at your chri&s;tening; &s;o you may be &s;ure &s;he is an oddity."</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure," &s;aid Clara, "&s;he has no card parties."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Card parties," &s;aid Betty, "la ble&s;s you, Mi&s;s, I dare &s;ay there is not a hou&s;e within &s;ix or &s;even miles of her."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Clara; "I &s;hall have a charming time of it! but there is no per|&s;uading papa; I don't know what's come to him; &s;o you mu&s;t pack up my things; let's &s;ee; I &s;hall take my pink lu&s;tering and my blue &s;attin &s;lip; then there's my &s;potted book mu&s;lin and my fine jaconet with &s;prigs; as for the &s;triped mu&s;lin, you will not forget that."</P>
<P>"La, mi&s;s," &s;aid Betty; "&s;ure you will not want &s;o many clothes!"</P>
<P>"I de&s;ire you will put up all that I tell you," &s;aid Clara, &s;harply; "and don't for|get my cap with the blue and white fea|thers. The only entertainment I &s;hall have, will be the plea&s;ure of dre&s;&s;ing and undre&s;&s;|ing my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Very true, mi&s;s," &s;aid Betty, who al|ways flattered the follies of her mi&s;tre&s;s, and immediately &s;et about performing the orders &s;he had given.</P>
<P>Earley the next morning the coach was at the door, and Clara, in &s;pite of her reluct|ance,
<PB N="8" REF="030966_0011_0FEA0C5149A38B68">
&s;et out with her father and brother for the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>HOSPITABLE MANSION</HEAD>
<P>Of Mrs. Mills, at which they arrived to|wards evening the next day. It was &s;itu|tuate in the mo&s;t fruitful part of the county; on a ri&s;ing ground, one &s;ide of which com|manded a view of di&s;tant hills and beauti|ful enclo&s;ures, and the other of a cheerful village, the inhabitants of which looked gay with health and indu&s;try. The re|ception of our travellers was the mo&s;t ten|ter and affectionate; Mrs. Mills embraced her nephew and niece with tears of joy, and gently chid her brother for having &s;o long e&s;tranged her from tho&s;e in whom her heart was &s;o deeply intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Clara and William, who&s;e faults proceed|ed, not from a bad or in&s;en&s;ible heart, but from an erroneous education, were touch|ed with her care&s;&s;es, and the more &s;o as they could not perceive in her countenance or manners the lea&s;t trace of that au&s;terity they had ridiculou&s;ly attached to her cha|racter.</P>
<P>Mr. Clement, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s required di&s;patch, &s;taid only to take a &s;light refre&s;h|ment, and again &s;et forward on his journey, promi&s;ing to render his ab&s;ence as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible: for Clara, who, however recon|ciled
<PB N="9" REF="030966_0012_0FEA0C561B930560">
to her aunt, could not over come the di&s;gu&s;t &s;he felt at the idea of pa&s;&s;ing a week without amu&s;ement, &s;tept a&s;ide and private|ly entreated her father to <HI>&s;hort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ne of their penance.</HI></P>
<P>Re&s;t being the mo&s;t de&s;irable after a fa|tiguing journey, the young people were ear|ly conducted to bed, where they &s;lept &s;ound|ly till called upon to ri&s;e the next morn|ing.</P>
<P>William had for &s;ome time entertained him&s;elf in the garden when his aunt en|tered the breakfa&s;t-parlour; but it was not till repeatedly told, Mrs. Mills waited breakfa&s;t, that Clara was prevailed upon to get up and dre&s;s; the lady, however, re|ceived her with her u&s;ual kindne&s;s, and rea|dily accepting her apologies, they were &s;oon &s;eated at the breakfa&s;t table.</P>
<P>"Do you ri&s;e every morning &s;o early, madam?" &s;aid Clara, upon her aunt ob|&s;erving that &s;he did not appear to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> come the fatigue of her journey.</P>
<P>"Certainly, my dear," replied Mrs. Mills; "one mu&s;t be wholly in&s;en&s;ible to the beauties of nature, to prefer a &s;tate of in|activity to the glorious contemplation of it on a fine &s;ummer's morning.</P>
<P>"I will an&s;wer for it," &s;aid William, archly, "that my &s;i&s;ter, by her own con|&s;ent, would not ri&s;e till ten or eleven o'clock for the fine&s;t &s;ight in the world."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="030966_0013_0FEA0C57C5E7C3B8">
Clara coloured with vexation, and dart|ing a glance of di&s;plea&s;ure at her brother, &s;aid, "he need not be &s;o &s;harp upon her, for it was only &s;ince he had been at &s;chool that he was become &s;uch a mighty early ri&s;er.</P>
<P>William &s;eeing his &s;i&s;ter's di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;aid, "he did not mean to offend her," and owned "he had once been as fond of his bed as &s;he," but &s;aid "it was now as great a pain to him to lie late, as it had for|merly been to ri&s;e early."</P>
<P>Mrs. Mills ob&s;erved, "that the habit of ri&s;ing early was ea&s;ily acquired," and &s;aid "&s;he could not think we were authorized by our maker to wa&s;te tho&s;e precious hours in &s;loth, which might be rendered benefici|al to our&s;elves, and u&s;eful to our fellow creatures."</P>
<P>"But do you not find the day very long, madam? &s;aid Clara.</P>
<P>"Not in the lea&s;t," returned Mrs. Mills, "on the contrary I often find it too &s;hort to fulfil all the duties it nece&s;&s;arily brings along with it."</P>
<P>"A&s;toni&s;hing!" &s;aid Clara; how is it po&s;&s;ible, madam, that you can employ your time? In London, where there are many things to amu&s;e one, I am generally tired before night."</P>
<P>"From this," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "I mu&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="030966_0014_0FEA0C5969906568">
judge that our amu&s;ements and pur&s;uits dif|fer widely; I &s;hould a&s;k my dear girl, in what yours con&s;i&s;t? had we time to enter upon the &s;ubject; but a walk before the day be too far advanced to render it &s;ultry, will, I think be agreeable."</P>
<P>The young people replied, "they &s;hould like it extremely, and in a few minutes, were ready to attend their good friend."</P>
<P>The fragance of the breeze, the harmony of the birds, and above all the kind conde|&s;cen&s;ion of Mrs. Mills, con&s;pired to render the walk agreeable, and they continued it on the banks of a winding river, conver&s;|ing on different &s;ubjects till the attention of Clara, who&s;e ob&s;ervations did not in ge|neral extend beyond the fa&s;hion of a cap, or the colour of a ribbon, was attract|ed by the &s;warms of young fi&s;h that appeared in the &s;hallow water. "I never, in my life," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;aw &s;uch numbers! look William, they are ab&s;olutely innu|merable; I &s;uppo&s;e this river is remarkable for fi&s;h?"</P>
<P>"Remarkable!" &s;aid William, laughing, "why you may &s;ee as many in every river, if you have a mind to look."</P>
<P>"I do not believe that," &s;aid Clara; "I am &s;ure I never walked by one where there were &s;uch quantities."</P>
<P>'Your attention, my dear,' &s;aid Mrs.
<PB N="12" REF="030966_0015_0FEA0C5B284795A0">
Mills, "mu&s;t have been directed another way; William is very right, there is nothing &s;ingular in what you &s;ee; innumerable as the young fry appear, many rivers produce more abundantly than this."</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible!" &s;aid &s;he, and added, &s;till fixing her eyes upon the water, "what prodigious quantities!"</P>
<P>"The increa&s;e is indeed wonderful," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "but what may not be ex|pected when a &s;ingle fi&s;h is capable of pro|ducing millions of its &s;pecies."</P>
<P>"Millions!" exclaimed William and his &s;i&s;ter at the &s;ame in&s;tant, "did you &s;ay mil|lions?"</P>
<P>"I did," replied Mrs. Mills; "the cod produces at a birth, eight or nine millions; the flounder above a million; the mackerel five hundred thou&s;and; and as for the her|ring, Mr. Buffon, a great naturali&s;t, &s;uppo|&s;es that if a &s;ingle one was left to multiply undi&s;turbed for twenty years, it would pro|duce a progeny more numerous than the inhabitants of ten &s;uch globes, as this we live upon."</P>
<P>"Amazing" &s;aid Clara, "and how many different &s;orts of fi&s;h do you think there are, aunt?"</P>
<P>"To the be&s;t of my recollection," re|plied Mrs. Mills, "naturali&s;ts de&s;cribe upwards of four hundred, but it is &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="13" REF="030966_0016_0FEA0C5F0B116F60">
that many more have e&s;caped ob&s;er|vation."</P>
<P>"I wonder for my part," &s;aid Wil|liam, "they do not &s;top the cour&s;e of the rivers."</P>
<P>"The greater part," re&s;umed Mrs. Mills, "are confined to the &s;ea, and would expire in fre&s;h water; but &s;uch is their a&s;toni&s;hing increa&s;e, that the ocean it&s;elf would be too limited to contain them, did not the exi&s;t|ence of one &s;pecies depend on the de&s;truc|tion of another."</P>
<P>"What, do they eat one another?"</P>
<P>"Yes;" replied Mrs. Mills, "it is com|puted that &s;carcely one in five thou&s;and e&s;capes the perils of its youth: the young fi&s;h become the prey of the older, and tho&s;e that e&s;cape, in their turn, devour &s;uch as are &s;maller than them&s;elves."</P>
<P>William was going to reply, but was prevented by his &s;i&s;ter, who exclaimed, "what a leap that fi&s;h gave! I declare, it made me &s;tart; did you ob&s;erve, madam, it jumped quite out of the water?"</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> you ad|mire agility, what will you &s;ay to the &s;al|mon, which is frequently &s;een to throw it&s;elf up cataracts and precipices many yards high."</P>
<P>"Is that po&s;&s;ible?"</P>
<P>"It is a fact well known," &s;aid Mrs.
<PB N="14" REF="030966_0017_0FEA0C615DC05158">
Mills; "the generality of fi&s;h, as I before ob&s;erved to you, are confined to the &s;ea; but a few quit the &s;ea at certain &s;ea&s;ons, to depo&s;it their &s;pawn in the gravelly beds of rivers: of this kind is the &s;almon, which upon the&s;e occa&s;ions will &s;wim up rivers five hundred miles from the &s;ea, and not only brave various enemies, but &s;pring up cataracts and precipices of an amazing height, that interrupt its pro|gre&s;s."</P>
<P>"How &s;urpri&s;ing!"</P>
<P>"And are they as anxious to return to the &s;ea?" a&s;ked William.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Mrs. Mills, "equally &s;o were they confined to the fre&s;h water lon|ger than the time nature has appointed for the pre&s;ervation of their &s;pecies, it is prov|ed, by experience, that they become &s;ick|ly, pine away, and expire the &s;econd year: the &s;almon, therefore, has no &s;ooner depo|&s;ited her eggs, which &s;he does with great care in the gravelly bottom of the river, than &s;he returns to the &s;ea, if &s;he e&s;capes the various &s;nares laid for her by the fi&s;h|ermen."</P>
<P>"Pray, aunt," &s;aid William, where is the &s;almon mo&s;tly caught?"</P>

is not a&s;certained: Some authors think their numbers oblige them to emigrate; others, that they take the&s;e long voyages to avoid the large fi&s;h that inhabit the frozen ocean; but the opinion more generally entertained is, that having exhau&s;ted the &s;tock of in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ect-food, with which tho&s;e &s;eas abound, they travel &s;outhward in pur&s;uit of a fre&s;h &s;upply, which awaits them at the time of their arrival in the Briti&s;h channel.

"As Mrs. Mills and her young friends conver&s;ed thus, the &s;ky became &s;uddenly overca&s;t, and they were glad to take &s;hel|ter from a &s;hower, beneath the branches of a &s;preading elm.

<P>"I hope neither of the&s;e misfortunes will happen," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, with her u&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s: "This tree will afford us &s;helter for &s;ome time; and the &s;hower is too violent to continue."</P>
<P>"Ah," &s;aid Clara, "it does not look as if it would cea&s;e: See it already begins to drip through the tree. Dear, what &s;hall we do? I'm &s;ure I &s;hall get my death of cold."</P>
<P>"Do not alarm your&s;elf, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mills. "When a misfortune can|not be avoided, the wi&s;e&s;t way is to &s;ub|mit to it with patience, and not to make it greater, by the &s;uppo&s;ition of evils that may never arrive, or if they do, that you cannot prevent."</P>
<P>As Mrs. Mills &s;aid this, they &s;aw a little girl ha&s;tening to them, with a bundle almo&s;t as big as her&s;elf. "How do you do, Peg|gy?" &s;aid Mrs. Mills, when &s;he came up to them.</P>

<P>where every thing wore the appearance of neatne&s;s and indu&s;try. Dame Bartlet, who, upon their entrance, was &s;pinning, &s;aid, &s;he hoped Mrs. Mills would not take it ami&s;s that &s;he did not get up to receive her; but that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed Peggy had mentioned her accident, or it mu&s;t &s;eem very &s;trange that &s;he did not come in per&s;on to offer her &s;ervices.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mills replied, that the attention &s;he had &s;hewn was quite &s;ufficient, and obliged her extremely.</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam," returned Dame Bartlet, "it would be very &s;trange indeed, if me or my girl were wanting in any duty to a lady who has been &s;o good to us."</P>
<P>Mrs. Mills now enquired into the &s;tate of Dame Bartlet's foot and recommended the treatment &s;he thought &s;alutary, de&s;iring &s;he would, in the afternoon, &s;end Peggy to her for &s;ome bal&s;am to apply to it. She then made enquiries after &s;everal &s;ick villa|gers, which, &s;he &s;aid, it was her de&s;ign that day to vi&s;it, had not the rain prevented her walk being extended &s;o far. Clara, in the mean while, who had never before &s;een a &s;pinning wheel, was attentively &s;urveying Dame Bartlet's. She admired with what

dexterity the good woman drew the thread from the di&s;taff, and declared &s;he thought it mu&s;t be a very pretty amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>"It was once," replied Mrs. Mills, "an employment of repute among per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank; at pre&s;ent it is, in general, con|fined to the lower and middling cla&s;s of peo|ple, for many of whom the di&s;taff provides a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence."</P>
<P>An hour-gla&s;s, which &s;tood in the win|dow, was not le&s;s the object of William's attention; it was the fir&s;t he had ever &s;een, and, before he enquired, he ventured many conjectures upon what might be its u&s;e. When Mrs. Mills explained to him in what manner it was calculated to mea&s;ure time, he ob&s;erved, that the people who in|vented it mu&s;t have <HI>very little brains,</HI> for that it was not half &s;o convenient as a watch.</P>
<P>"I agree with you," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "that it is not &s;o convenient as a watch; but cannot agree that the fir&s;t inventor of the hour-gla&s;s di&s;covered the lea&s;t want of ingenuity.&mdash;Tell me, William, were you in an i&s;land where no watch or clock could be procured, what &s;hould you think of the hour-gla&s;s?"</P>
<P>"I believe, aunt," &s;aid William, a little a&s;hamed of what he had &s;aid, "I &s;hould think it a great trea&s;ure; for I fancy it
<PB N="21" REF="030966_0024_0FEA0C7433F99290">
would be long enough before I &s;hould be able to make a watch or a clock."</P>
<P>"You &s;ee then," returned Mrs. Mills, "that we mu&s;t not always de&s;pi&s;e an in|vention for its &s;implicity, and that the va|lue of things depend much upon time, place, and circum&s;tance. It was long be|fore the hour gla&s;s fell into di&s;u&s;e, from the di&s;covery of a more convenient mode of mea&s;uring time. In the fir&s;t ages of Greece, it was cu&s;tomary for a per&s;on ap|pointed to the office, to a&s;cend an eminence every day, in the mid&s;t of the city, and proclaim that the &s;un had reached the high|e&s;t point of the heavens; in other words, that it was noon. Sun-dials were after|wards invented, and in time gave place to &s;till greater improvements. Clocks, though much inferior to tho&s;e now in u&s;e, were produced, and in time carried to the perfection you &s;o much admire. With re&s;|pect to our own country; the ingenious art of clock-making was introduced into it, in 1622, by Hugens, a native of Hol|land."</P>
<P>At this moment Peggy, who had for &s;ome time di&s;appeared, re-entered with a ba&s;ket of mulberries &s;he had been gather|ing.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee, Peggy," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, as the good girl &s;et them before the young people, "that you &s;till love to oblige."</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="030966_0025_0FEA0C75D2485FC8">
Peggy's eyes &s;parkled with plea&s;ure&mdash;&s;he blu&s;hed&mdash;courte&s;ied&mdash;&s;miled, and &s;aid &s;he wi&s;hed they had &s;omething better to offer.</P>
<P>Clara and her brother, who were ex|tremely fond of mulberries, immediately fell to; while Mrs. Mills, ob&s;erving that the rain had cea&s;ed, &s;aid &s;he would &s;tep to poor Su&s;an Mill&s;tone's: "For," &s;aid &s;he, "I hear the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band &s;ets heavy on her."</P>
<P>"Ay, truly does it," &s;aid Dame Bart|let; "&s;he has never held up her head &s;ince poor Ralph died. It is a pity &s;he takes on &s;o&mdash;&s;he does nothing but cry&mdash;neglects her work; and as to her poor children, they would make your heart ache; &s;he takes no thought of them.</P>
<P>"This is a &s;ad account indeed," replied the lady, "I will go and &s;ee what can be done."</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam," &s;aid Dame Bartlet, "you carry comfort wherever you go."</P>
<P>During the ab&s;ence of Mrs. Mills, Clara and her brother fini&s;hed the mulberries, and gathered from Dame Bartlet, who&s;e grateful heart longed to utter the prai&s;es of her benefactre&s;s, that &s;he was indebted to Mrs. Mills for the cottage, with all that it contained, and indeed, &s;he added, for every ble&s;&s;ing &s;he enjoyed: She was going,
<PB N="23" REF="030966_0026_0FEA0C779F6E1CB0">
in the warmth of her heart, to enter into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> particulars, had &s;he not been pre|vented by the return of the lady.</P>
<P>"May I be &s;o bold, Madam," &s;aid the good woman, "as to a&s;k how you found poor Su&s;an?"</P>
<P>"I found her, replied Mrs. Mills, "as you de&s;cribed, buried in grief; but have, I tru&s;t, left her more reconciled to her mi&s;|fortunes."</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant a little girl broke abrupt|ly into the cottage. "O joy, joy, neigh|bour Bartlet," &s;aid &s;he "mammy &s;ays &s;he will go to work to-morrow, and Madam Mills &s;ays Jane and I &s;hall go to &s;chool&mdash;and"&mdash;The child &s;topt, &s;eeing her benefac|tre&s;s, and drew back confu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The reader need not be told this was one of the poor woman's children whom the benevolent lady had ju&s;t vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mills, who&s;e benevolence was al|ways performed in &s;ecret, unwilling the &s;ubject &s;hould be further inve&s;tigated, &s;mi|led affably on the child, and ob&s;erving that the day was far advanced, bade farewel to Peggy and her mother, and ha&s;tily left the cottage, followed by her nephew and niece.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of their walk home, an ex|pre&s;&s;ion unguardedly e&s;caped Clara, which &s;trongly conveyed, that &s;he thought her

aunt conde&s;cended very much in vi&s;iting and &s;peaking, in &s;uch familiar terms, to per&s;ons who&s;e &s;tation in life was &s;o much beneath her own.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mills immediately entered upon this &s;ubject, and ob&s;erved in reply: That, in the eye of God, we were all equal: "He commands us," &s;aid &s;he, to love our neigh|bour as our&s;elves without any previous di&s;|tinction, whether he be poor or rich, a me|chanic or a gentleman."</P>
<P><HI>"To love our neighbour as our&s;elves,"</HI> re|turned Clara pertly: "Do you think there ever was an in&s;tance of any one loving ano|ther as well as him&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"Many," &s;aid Mrs. Mills: "Hi&s;tory abounds with examples that demon&s;trate the exi&s;tence of &s;uch virtue. If you are at all acquainted with hi&s;tory, you cannot forget the friend&s;hip of Damon and Pythias, nor the noble conduct of Leonidas, and many heroes of antiquity, who devoted them&s;elves to death for the &s;ervice of their country."</P>
<P>Clara, a&s;hamed to confe&s;s that &s;he was totally unacquainted with hi&s;tory, was &s;i|lent; but William, who was better inform|ed, acknowledged that tho&s;e heroes might truly be &s;aid to love others as well, nay better, than them&s;elves: but added, it was a long time &s;ince they lived.</P>

<P>"I do think," &s;aid William, "I recol|lect Mr. Smyth, our geographical ma&s;ter's de&s;cribing it: is it not in Canada, a pro|vince of North America?"</P>
<P>"It is," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "and is e&s;teemed one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities in the world; for two leagues above the great fall, the river is interrupted by a va|riety of le&s;&s;er falls, and runs with &s;uch ra|pidity,
<PB N="26" REF="030966_0029_0FEA0C7F89684F58">
that the large&s;t canoe would be overturned in an in&s;tant. Higher up the river is navigable, as you will find by the &s;tory I am going to relate.</P>
<P>"Two Indians went out one day in their canoe, at a &s;ufficient di&s;tance from the ca|taract, to be, as they imagined, out of dan|ger; but having drank too frequently of &s;ome brandy they unfortunately had with them, the fumes of it created a drow&s;ine&s;s, and they were &s;o imprudent as to &s;tretch them&s;elves at the bottom of the canoe, where they fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>"The canoe in the mean time, which they had been towing again&s;t the &s;tream, drove back further and further, and would in a very &s;hort time have precipitated them down the fall, had not the noi&s;e of it, which is heard at the di&s;tance of &s;ix, and at certain times, fifteen leagues, awakened them. Figure to your&s;elves, my dear chil|dren, what mu&s;t have been the feelings of the poor creatures at this moment; and how dearly they repented the intemperance which had hurried them into &s;uch danger, They exclaimed in an agony not to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed, that they were lo&s;t; but exerted their &s;trength to work the canoe towards an i&s;land which lies at the brink of the fall. Upon this, exhau&s;ted with labour and fatigue they at length landed; but up|on

reflection were &s;en&s;ible that unle&s;s they could find means to e&s;cape from this i&s;land, they had only exchanged one kind of death for another, &s;ince they mu&s;t unavoidably peri&s;h with hunger; the &s;ituation of the i&s;land, however, gave them &s;ome hopes; the lower end of it touches the precipice from whence the water falls, and divides the cataract in two parts; a &s;pace is con|&s;equently left between, where no water falls, and the rock is &s;een naked. Nece&s;|&s;ity &s;upplied them with invention; they formed a ladder of the bark of the linden tree, and fa&s;tening one end of it to a tree that grew at the edge of the precipice, de&s;cended by it to the water below, into which they threw them&s;elves, thinking, as it was not rapid in this part, to &s;wim to &s;hore."</P>
<P>"Had it been my ca&s;e," &s;aid Clara, "I &s;hould rather have died of hunger in the i&s;land, than have attempted my e&s;cape that way."</P>
<P>"The Indians," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "act|ed more wi&s;ely: while hope remains, it is our duty to exert our efforts to avert the misfortune that threatens us, when una|voidable, it is the highe&s;t wi&s;dom to bear it with fortitude and re&s;ignation."</P>
<P>"And did they reach the &s;hore, aunt?" &s;aid William.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="030966_0031_0FEA0C852DEB4B78">
"No," replied Mrs. Mills; "the wa|ters of the two cataracts, (for you know I told you one part of the fall was on one &s;ide of the i&s;land, and the other on the other) meeting, formed an eddy which, when they began to &s;wim, threw them back with violence again&s;t the rock. They made repeated trials, but with the &s;ame ill &s;ucce&s;s, till at length worn out with fa|tigue, their bodies much brui&s;ed, and the &s;kin in many parts torn off, from the vio|lence with which they were con&s;tantly thrown again&s;t the rock, they were forced to climb up the ladder again, into the i&s;land, from which they now thought nothing but death could deliver them.</P>
<P>"Their hopes once more revived, when they perceived &s;ome Indians on the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore. By &s;igns and cries, they at la&s;t drew their attention; but &s;uch was the perilous &s;ituation of the i&s;land, that though they &s;aw and pitied them, they gave them &s;mall hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The governor of the fort, however, being ac|quainted with their &s;ituation, humanely conceived a project for their deliverance. He reflected that the water on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the i&s;land, notwith&s;tanding it's ra|pidity, is &s;hallow, and thought by the help of long poles pointed with iron, it might be po&s;&s;ible to walk to the i&s;land. The
<PB N="29" REF="030966_0032_0FEA0C879F3C71D8">
difficulty was to find a per&s;on with &s;uffi|cient courage and genero&s;ity to attempt their re&s;cue at the hazard of his own life."</P>
<P>"Indeed," &s;aid Clara; "if their deli|verance depended upon that, I &s;hould have thought &s;mall hope remained of it."</P>
<P>"It was neverthele&s;s effected," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "two generous Indians under|took to execute the governor's project, re|&s;olving to deliver their poor brethren, or to peri&s;h in the attempt."</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible?" &s;aid William; "what noble &s;ouls!"</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "they prepar|ed for their perilous expedition, and took leave of all their friends, as if they had been going to death: each was furni&s;h|ed with two poles pointed with iron, which they &s;et to the bottom of the &s;tream, to keep them &s;teady and &s;upport them again&s;t the current, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have carried them along with it. In this manner they proceeded, and actually ar|rived at the i&s;land, where, delivering two of the poles to the poor Indians, who had now been nine days upon the i&s;land, and were almo&s;t &s;tarved to death, they all four returned &s;afe to the &s;hore they had left."</P>
<P>"What a providential e&s;cape!" &s;aid

William; "how rejoiced the poor fellows mu&s;t have been to receive the poles that were to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in getting away!"</P>
<P>"Their joy," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "on the pro&s;pect of their deliverance, mu&s;t certain|ly have been great, but I will venture to affirm, it did not exceed that, of the gene|rous Indians, who hazarded their lives to effect it."</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t certainly," &s;aid William, "have given them great plea&s;ure, but what a ri&s;k they ran!"</P>
<P>"True" &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "but on the other hand, what a gratification! do you think there could be a plea&s;ure equal to that felt by the generous Indians, when they effected the deliverance of their poor country-men."</P>
<P>"They were certainly noble creatures," &s;aid Clara, "one does not often hear, even in civilized countries, of per&s;ons who act &s;o di&s;intere&s;tedly."</P>
<P>"Though in&s;tances of &s;uch genero&s;ity," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "do not occur daily, they are, neverthele&s;s, more frequent than we are aware of.</P>
<P>"Do you think &s;o?" &s;aid William.</P>
<P>"Yes;" replied Mrs. Mills, "the mo&s;t generous actions, are performed in &s;ecret, and &s;hun the noi&s;e of public fame; on this account, it is, that they do not &s;o often

<P>"I will an&s;wer for it," &s;aid Clara, "&s;he had not courage to venture down for the other."</P>
<P>"You are mi&s;taken," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "far from being intimidated, the moment &s;he recovered her &s;pirits, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon being let down for the poor creature that remained, which &s;he actually was; but her exertions at this time failed of &s;ucce&s;s; the poor man being drawn up dead."</P>
<P>"Is this really a true &s;tory?" &s;aid Clara. "It is an undoubted fact," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "the corporation of the town of Noyon, as a &s;mall token of their approbation, pre|&s;ented the generous girl with &s;ix hundred livres, and conferred on her, the civic crown, with a medal, engraven with the arms of the town, her name, and a narra|tive of the actions. It is al&s;o &s;aid, that the Duke of Orleans &s;ent her five hundred livres, and &s;ettled two hundred yearly on her for life."</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="030966_0036_0FEA0C9262D54838">
"But to return," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, to our fir&s;t point: the&s;e, and many more examples of the &s;ame kind, that I could prove, that when our ble&s;&s;ed Lord commands us to love our neighbour as our&s;elves, he does not exact that which is beyond the ability of his creatures to perform.</P>
<P>"Why, to be &s;ure," &s;aid Clara, "both the Indians and the generous girl, you have ju&s;t mentioned, may truly be &s;aid to love their neighbour as them&s;elves; but it is much more ea&s;y to admire than to imitate."</P>
<P>"Very true Clara," replied William, "I am &s;ure, though I &s;hould have pitied the poor m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n in danger of &s;uffocation, and the Indians who were left on the i&s;land, I never &s;hould have had courage to deliver them at the ri&s;k of my own life."</P>
<P>"Had you thought it your duty, my dear William," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "to hazard your life, in &s;uch a cau&s;e, I hope God, (without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we can do no|thing,) would have given you &s;trength and courage to perform it.

Nor are opportunities, wanting in which the poor, as well as the rich, may &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w their obedience to the divine command: Peggy Bartlet, whom we had ju&s;t left, is an example of this; you would &s;carcely credit, of what con&s;equence that poor child is to the whole neighbourhood: If a neigh|bour fall &s;ick, Peggy is immediately at hand, to run for the Doctor to quiet the children, or to perform any little office of kindne&s;s within her power. If &s;he is from &s;chool, and unemployed by her mother, the wheel of Dame Grime&s;tone, their next neighbour, who has a large family, never &s;tood &s;till. If any difference happen among her companions, Peggy is the fir&s;t to &s;et on foot a reconciliation; and as for the chil|dren of Robert Gould, a poor labourer, who lives within a few doors of them, Peggy has already taught two of them to read, and a third nearly to &s;ay the al|phabet. In &s;hort, &s;he never lets &s;lip an op|portunity, in which &s;he can render her&s;elf u&s;eful, and by this means, does more good within her little circle, than tho&s;e, who&s;e abilities are more exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>"I liked her," &s;aid William, "from the very fir&s;t, &s;he looked &s;o good&punc; natured, and was &s;o civil."</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="030966_0038_0FEA0C9658D72180">
"Yes," returned Mrs. Mills, "and her civility &s;prings wholly from the goodne&s;s of her heart."</P>
<P>"Is her father yet alive?" a&s;ked Clara.</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "he died when &s;he was &s;carcely a twelthmonth old, leav|ing his widow in great di&s;tre&s;s."</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid William' "now I under|&s;tand; you have taken care of them ever &s;ince. Dame Bartlet told us, that, next to God, &s;he owed every thing to you aunt."</P>
<P>"You are mi&s;taken, my dear William," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "my knowledge of Peggy and her mother has been recent. It is not more than two years &s;ince an event in which the goodne&s;s of their hearts was &s;ig|nally di&s;played, recommended them to my notice, and gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e little &s;er|vices which their gratitude &s;o far over-rates."</P>
<P>"Pray, aunt," &s;aid Clara, "what was the circum&s;tance."</P>
<P>"To an&s;wer your que&s;tion," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "I mu&s;t enter into a detail longer than the pre&s;ent time will permit."</P>
<P>"O now," &s;aid William "you have rai|&s;ed our curio&s;ity. Do tell us&mdash;I know it is &s;omething intere&s;ting."</P>

Before &s;he could fini&s;h the &s;entence, the gate opened, and Clara, upon entering the hall, perceived the hand of the clock upon the &s;troke of three; little time remained for the toilet: &s;he ha&s;tened into her dre&s;|&s;ing room, and found it was po&s;&s;ible to com|plete that which commonly took up two hours, equally as well in twenty minutes.</P>

<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>As near as I can recollect, it is about two years &s;ince I every day ob&s;ervrd a lit|tle girl, clean, but very meanly dre&s;&s;ed, re|gularly cro&s;s the field, which lies contigu|ous to my orchard. She had commonly a ba&s;ket upon her arm, and made her way with &s;uch ha&s;te, that my curio&s;ity was ex|cited, and I a&s;ked Banks, my woman, to which of the villagers the child belonged</P>

Banks replied, that &s;he had her&s;elf ob|&s;erved her and more than once made the &s;ame enquiry, but had not gained any &s;atis|factory account of her.</P>
<P>This intere&s;ted me &s;till further; and I de&s;ired Banks, the next time &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, to acco&s;t her.&mdash;Whether this was through negligence omitted, or that the girl took another road, I know not, but I heard no tidings of her for three days; when having extended my morning walk beyond its u&s;u|al limits, I &s;aw her, with her little ba&s;ket, &s;ome yards before me, cro&s;s a retired path, into which I had ju&s;t turned, and make towards a hut, that was nearly concealed by two large elms.

<P>The poor man &s;hook his head, and a deep &s;igh from the woman explained too clearly that they could not an&s;wer the que&s;tion to the wi&s;hes of their little friend;

who, having &s;ympathized with them a mo|ment in &s;ilence, uncovered her ba&s;ket, and &s;aid, &s;he hoped they could eat an egg, as &s;he had brought a couple newly laid.</P>
<P>An expre&s;&s;ive glance from the poor man told his gratitude, and the woman pre&s;&s;ing the hand of the girl, exclaimed, 'Ah!

"I under&s;tood, in general terms, upon my entrance, that a &s;eries of misfortunes had reduced this unhappy pair to their pre|&s;ent mi&s;erable condition; but it was not a time to require particulars; their &s;ituation called for immediate redre&s;s."</P>
<P>"And I am &s;ure aunt," &s;aid William, "you did not refu&s;e it."</P>
<P>"If I had, William, I mu&s;t have been unworthy the affluence with which Provi|dence has ble&s;&s;ed me," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "but with re&s;pect to the poor man, a&s;&s;i&s;|tance came too late; notwith&s;tanding the humane exertions of Mr. Ben&s;on, our apo|thecary, who, at my reque&s;t, went imme|diately, he did not &s;urvive till the next morning; and grief increa&s;ed the fever of the woman &s;o much, that it was not till &s;ome days after, Mr. Ben&s;on could give hopes of her recovery. Time and reflec|tion, however, compo&s;ed her mind; the fever abated, and &s;he gathered &s;trength daily. As &s;he had been removed to my hou&s;e, I had frequent opportunities of &s;ee|ing her, and thought I ob&s;erved in her &s;omething above the vulgar; not that there was any thing in her deportment unbecom|ing or incon&s;i&s;tent with an humble &s;tation; but her &s;entiments, though plain and una|dorned, were expre&s;&s;ed with a propriety &s;eldom met with in low life: She appeared to be well acquainted with the Scriptures

<P>I de&s;ired &s;he would be more explicit, and &s;he continued: 'My father was a poor labourer on the e&s;tate of Sir James Ram&s;|den, who&s;e lady, when I was twelve years old, took me into the family to wait upon Mi&s;s Frances, her younge&s;t daughter, at that time ju&s;t &s;even years of age.

As &s;he grew up, her &s;ole delight was in reading the Scrip|tures and other books of divinity, or in per|forming acts of charity and devotion, How often, while other young ladies have been engaged at the card table, or places of pub|lic diver&s;ion, has &s;he pa&s;&s;ed her time, in in|&s;tructing me in the word of God, and the duties of my &s;tation!

She then, at my reque&s;t, acquainted me with what afterwards befel her, and, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, went on thus:</P>
<P>Time, Madam, reconciled me to the lo&s;s of my dear young lady; but the pre|cepts I had &s;o often received from her mouth, and &s;een enforced by her example, as the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>"were written on the tablets of my heart,"</HI> and I can with truth &s;ay, "that I have found them <HI>more precious than gold or fine raiment."</HI> I continued in the family of Lady Ram&s;den till I married my late hu&s;band, an hone&s;t indu&s;trious man, who rented a &s;mall farm thirty miles di&s;|tant. For the fir&s;t &s;ix years after our mar|riage, every thing went on well, and we were getting forward in the world apace; but, unfortunately for us, our landlord died

&s;uddenly, and the per&s;on into who&s;e hands the farm fell, not only refu&s;ed to renew our lea&s;e, which was nearly expired, but in&s;i&s;t|ed upon &s;uch an enormous advance of rent, that my hu&s;band thought it prudent to quit the farm.</P>
<P>We took Harley farm, which you know, Madam, is within a mile of the next village. The rent was higher than that we formerly paid, but my hu&s;band thought, by attention and indu&s;try, to make it an|&s;wer; and I am &s;ure, poor &s;oul! he did not &s;pare that: but indeed, &s;aid Mrs. Brown, with tears in her eyes, we &s;eemed to have left all our good fortune at the old farm; the &s;oil of the new one proved unfruitful, and, in &s;pight of all my hu&s;band's labour, pro|duced &s;uch poor crops, that we lo&s;t con&s;i|derably the two fir&s;t years. We con&s;oled our&s;elves with the hopes that the next would be better (for we had taken a long lea&s;e of the farm) but we were di&s;appoint|ed, and &s;ome &s;tables belonging to our next neighbour, unfortunately taking fire, com|municated to our granary, where it did us con&s;iderable damage before it could be ex|tingui&s;hed. The&s;e, and other lo&s;&s;es, pre|vented my hu&s;band's making his regular payments, and preyed &s;o much upon his mind, that it greatly affected his health, and a cold, which he caught about this time, falling upon his lungs, laid the
<PB N="43" REF="030966_0046_0FEA0CA9A5653E00">
foundation for the di&s;ea&s;e that put an end to his life.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, things grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e; we found our&s;elves every year more in|volved; and our arrears with our landlord being con&s;iderable, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our effects, and we were turned into the world de&s;titute. As we had neither money nor friends, we could expect &s;upport only from our own labour, and, weak as he was, my hu&s;band determined to &s;et out immedi|ately for a farm about four miles off, where he had been told hands were much wanted. In &s;hort, Madam, we &s;et out, but in the way my poor hu&s;band grew &s;o bad, that he could not proceed: he fainted, and when he recovered, I thought it a great ble&s;&s;ing that the &s;hed in which you, Madam, di&s;|covered us was at hand to receive him. He crawled to it, thinking to &s;tay there till his &s;trength returned; but, poor &s;oul, he grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e. The little mo|ney we had, which amounted only to a few &s;hillings, was &s;oon expended: want &s;tared us in the face, and I &s;et out for the village I had left to &s;eek employment. You will wonder, Madam, that I did not &s;eek it up|on the &s;pot; and, I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay, that I was with-held by pride. I knew it mu&s;t lead to a di&s;covery of our mi&s;erable retreat, which I had hitherto carefully con|cealed,

by going for the few nece&s;&s;aries we wanted at night.</P>
<P>I had &s;carcely entered the village when I was met by Peggy Bartlet, the little girl whom you conde&s;cended the other day to notice: &s;he is the daughter of a poor wi|dow, to whom in better days I had render|ed &s;ome little &s;ervices. The poor child threw her arms round my neck overjoyed, and run to tell her mother, who weeds, &s;pins, chares, or any way earns a penny to &s;upport her&s;elf and child, that I was there. The poor woman upbraided me kindly for having left the village, without &s;aying where I was going, and &s;aid, &s;he had de|termined to leave work that evening earlier than u&s;ual, to find me out, and &s;ee if &s;he could not do any thing for us.</P>
<P>I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay, Madam, that my pride was &s;o great, that I preferred telling a fal&s;ehood to acknowledging the truth of our &s;ituation to this hone&s;t creature: I pre|tended that my hu&s;band had got into work at Burlington farm, for which we had &s;et out, and that being di&s;engaged, I al&s;o wi&s;h|ed for employment; enquiring if &s;he knew of any?</P>
<P>She replied, that hands were wanted in the garden, where &s;he worked; but add|ed, that it was not employment for me.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="030966_0048_0FEA0CB0162DEAE0">
My nece&s;&s;ities were too pre&s;&s;ing to he&s;i|tate; I replied that I &s;hould gladly accept the employment, and begged &s;he would apply for me directly.</P>
<P>Ah! &s;aid the good creature, &s;haking her head, little did I think&mdash;and her heart was &s;o full, &s;he could &s;ay no more.</P>
<P>I &s;aid I had never been accu&s;tomed to idlene&s;s, and cheerfully &s;ubmitted to the will of God.</P>
<P>I was immediately &s;et to work, and in the evening, with a heart &s;omewhat light|ened, I returned to my hu&s;band with the pittance I had earned. I continued for &s;e|veral days to attend regularly at the gar|den, but the anxiety I felt in leaving my hu&s;band, who every day grew wor&s;e, was &s;uch, that it produced a &s;low few, which reduced me &s;o much, that it was with diffi|culty I pur&s;ued my labours. Still, however, I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with the thought, that the extent of our mi&s;ery was unknown; till re|turning one evening &s;omething earlier than u&s;ual, I met little Peggy at the entrance of our retreat. The poor girl fell upon her knees, and with tears in her eyes, begged I would not be angry with her. She &s;aid, &s;he had remarked how ill, and &s;ad, I look|ed, and was afraid things were wor&s;e than I &s;aid, which had made her determine to watch me home. But little did I think, &s;aid &s;he, &s;obbing, they were &s;o bad.</P></Q>

"The grief of the poor child," &s;aid Mrs. Brown, "affected me &s;o much, that I could not forbear mingling my tears with hers, and for &s;ome minutes, our hearts were &s;o full, that neither of us could &s;peak: at la&s;t, &s;he broke abruptly from me, and taking the path toward home, I thought of &s;eeing her no more that night; but I was mi&s;taken, about an hour and a half after, a &s;oft rap came to the door; I opened it, and was not a little &s;urprized to find there Peggy and her mother, each charged with a load they could &s;carcely &s;tand under; would you be|lieve it, Madam, they had brought us their mattre&s;s and blankets! and actually, till your bounty, made it unnece&s;&s;ary, lay on the ground them&s;elves. I begged, and &s;o did my poor hu&s;band, that they would take them back, but it was all to no purpo&s;e: hea|ven be prai&s;ed, they &s;aid, they had found us out, and had a mattre&s;s and blankets for us. Nor was this all, I &s;oon grew &s;o ill, that I could not, as u&s;ual, go to work, and then Madam, we mu&s;t have &s;tarved, had it not been for the&s;e good creatures, who, I am certain, often went without nece&s;&s;aries them&s;elves, that they might &s;upply us with what they fancied we could eat.</P>
<P>The good woman her&s;elf was obliged to keep clo&s;e to work, but Peggy con&s;tantly &s;laved to us twice, and &s;ometimes three

times a-day. She never came empty-hand|ed; if it were but a few &s;ticks &s;he had pick|ed up by the way, to make us a little fire, &s;he had always &s;omething: and endeavour|ed to alleviate our di&s;tre&s;s by a thou&s;and kind attentions.</P>
<P>"Indeed, madam," &s;aid Mrs. Brown, "had it not been for tho&s;e good people, we mu&s;t have been lo&s;t for want. I can never forget their kindne&s;s."</P>
<P>"This account," continued Mrs. Mills, "rai&s;ed Dame Bartlet and Peggy high in my e&s;teem: I wi&s;hed to &s;ee them, and one day took a ride to the village where they lived. Upon enquiry, I found, as Mrs. Brown had before told me, that dame Bart|let was the widow of a poor weaver; that by dint of hard labour, &s;he &s;upported her|&s;elf and child, and paid for a room, or ra|ther garret. I learnt further, that &s;he had not always been accu&s;tomed to labour with|out doors; but that two years before, &s;he had the misfortune to be robbed of her &s;pinning-wheel, which before &s;upported her, and &s;ince that time, &s;he was glad to weed, chare, or do any thing to earn an hone&s;t penny. The cottage, which we this morning vi&s;ited, happened at that time to be vacant, and I thought it could not be occupied by more worthy inhabitants. I, therefore, a&s;ked dame Bartlet, if &s;he would
<PB N="48" REF="030966_0051_0FEA0CB75B401AD0">
like to remove to it? &s;he was rejoiced at the propo&s;al, and when, I added, I would furni&s;h it, and purcha&s;e a &s;pinning-wheel, Peggy and &s;he were nearly out of their wits with joy. I need not tell you, I was as good as my word; a fortnight after, they removed to the cottage, and have &s;ince oc|cupied it. An opportunity, al&s;o, &s;oon offer|ed of placing Mrs. Brown in a &s;tation to which &s;he does great credit; we have a &s;chool of indu&s;try in the village, the mi&s;tre&s;s of which dying, Mrs. Brown &s;upplies her place. Peggy attends the &s;chool, and tho' Mrs. Brown is too ju&s;t to let her partiality appear at improper times, I am certain, &s;he entertains the &s;ame affection for her, as if &s;he were her own child."</P>
<P>Mrs. Mills concluded her narrative, as the &s;ervant brought in tea. A walk upon the lawn occupied the time, till the bell rung for &s;upper, after which, the whole fa|mily being a&s;&s;embled, the day was as u&s;ual, concluded in prayer and thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>The next morning, Clara ro&s;e at a more early hour, and took care to be ready to receive her aunt in the breakfa&s;t parlour.

<HEAD>THE APIARY.</HEAD>
<P>at which, they pre&s;ently arrived. Among the hives, was one different to the re&s;t; Clara ob&s;erved it, and enquired the rea&s;on?</P>
<P>"That hive, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, was con&s;tructed by my own directions; you &s;ee it is chiefly of gla&s;s: I &s;pend many hours in ob&s;erving the little bu&s;y people that in|habit it."</P>
<P>"I have been told aunt," &s;aid William, "that bees have a queen; is it true?"</P>
<P>"It is;" &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "and what is more, this queen has a palace, guards to attend her, and &s;ubjects over whom &s;he reigns as ab&s;olute."</P>
<P>You are je&s;ting with us, aunt?</P>
<P>"I am perfectly &s;erious," replied Mrs. Mills: "In every &s;warm, there are three &s;orts of bees; the working bee, the drone which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the male, and the queen, which is longer and more beautiful than the re&s;t, and is the mother of the whole &s;warm."</P>
<P>But you &s;aid the queen had a palace.</P>
<P>She has a cell proportionable to her &s;ize, rai&s;ed from a large foundation, either on the flat or edge of the comb, and different|ly formed from the re&s;t. This I think, may, with no great impropriety be called her pa|lace. She generally keeps her&s;elf retired in
<PB N="50" REF="030966_0053_0FEA0CBB77C367E8">
the upper apartments of the comb, and whenever &s;he appears in public, which is generally to depo&s;it her eggs, is attended by &s;everal large bees, if not by the whole &s;warm, who flutter their wings, and ap|pear all in tran&s;port.</P>
<P>"You were very right indeed aunt, &s;aid William, "to &s;ay that the queen had her palace and her guards; how wonderful!"</P>
<P>"The attachment of the whole &s;warm to the queen bee," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "is in|deed, wonderful: an author, who has given us many curious particulars concerning the&s;e in&s;ects, relates, that having once an inclination to prove, how far this &s;urpriz|ing in&s;tinct, would influence them, he took a &s;warm of bees that had been hived the day before, and having &s;hook them in a lump, on a gra&s;s plot, &s;eperated the queen bee from the re&s;t, cilpt one of her wings, and kept her in a box apart. A general confu&s;ion immediately took place, contrary to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, which is to clu&s;ter together, the bees immediately &s;cattered them&s;elves over the gra&s;s, and flew here and there in pur&s;uit of their queen with a piteous di&s;contented noi&s;e. When the box, in which &s;he was confined, was opened, a different &s;cene took place; they immediately gathered together from all parts, and in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, the whole &s;warm
<PB N="51" REF="030966_0054_0FEA0CBD2D4C6F80">
clu&s;tered around it, waiting till the queen, as u&s;ual, &s;hould lead them to &s;ome place for their common pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>But the poor queen, was unable to ri&s;e; and her faithful &s;ubjects, cho&s;e rather to die with her, than to de&s;ert her, for tho' pinched with hunger, they would not fly to get any food. Nor was the affection of the queen le&s;s to her &s;ubjects: when &s;epa|rated from them, &s;he refu&s;ed the honey that was repeatedly offered her. I am &s;ure, you will be &s;orry to hear, that having continued four days, without ta&s;ting any food, they all literally died by famine, except the queen, who lived only a few hours after<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wardour on Bees.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid William, "how I &s;hould have grieved; it was a cruel experiment, but a convincing proof, that animals have rea&s;on.</P>
<P>"Hold, my dear William," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "be cautious of falling into &s;o gro&s;s an error. Though the order and &s;eeming rationally, which is di&s;cerned in the animal creation, cannot fail of rai&s;ing our ideas of that Being, who&s;e wi&s;dom is di&s;played in the minute&s;t of his works, let us not imagine he has be&s;towed on them that &s;uperior fa|culty man alone enjoys. The little bu&s;y creatures of whom we &s;peak, however

wonderful their labours and economy, act by &s;tated laws which providence has implanted in their nature: in&s;en&s;ible of good and evil, they are impelled only to the performance of that which is nece&s;&s;ary to their pre&s;ervation, or the wi&s;e purpo&s;es for which they are cre|ated."</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant the attention of William was attracted by a bee returning to the hive, and he exclaimed, "look, aunt at that bee, it is &s;o loaded, it can &s;carcely fly."</P>
<P>"It is indeed well laden," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "but will &s;oon be ea&s;ed of its bur|den; ob&s;erve, William, it is now at the en|trance of the hive, and is met by &s;everal bees, who are bu&s;ily employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting it to unload."</P>
<P>"Is that what they are about?"</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "they will &s;wal|low the little pellets the other has collected, and in their &s;tomachs they will acquire the con&s;i&s;tence of wax, which will afterward be ca&s;t up and turned over to other bees, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to knead it, and &s;pread it into different &s;heets, laid one upon ano|ther."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Clara, "it is a&s;toni&s;hing! but how do they collect the little pellets?"</P>
<P>"They collect the yellow du&s;t of flowers in the hairs of their body? then bru&s;h them&s;elves and form the grains into pellets. The honey is collected by a &s;ort of trunk;
<PB N="53" REF="030966_0056_0FEA0CC3E3560D10">
a &s;mall part of it goes to &s;upport the bee, and the re&s;t is pre&s;erved in a little bag, with which nature has furni&s;hed her &s;to|mach, to be ca&s;t up and depo&s;ited, after|wards, in magazines for the &s;upport of the community?"</P>
<P>"But I cannot conceive, aunt," &s;aid Clara, "of what &s;ervice the wax can be; do they eat it?"</P>
<P>"With the wax," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "they build their habitations, and &s;eal up the honey in their cells; they al&s;o mix it with honey, to make bee-bread for the &s;up|port of their young."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Clara, "I was never more intere&s;ted in my life in any &s;tory than in the account you have given us of the&s;e dear little creatures: If they have not rea&s;on, I am &s;ure they have a much larger &s;hare of in&s;tinct than any other creature."</P>
<P>"They certainly have," &s;aid William.</P>
<P>"A &s;ufficient portion of this principle," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "is vi&s;ible in the meane&s;t in&s;ect to rai&s;e our admiration of the &s;u|preme Being. It is certain none can ex|ceed the bee, who&s;e economy pre&s;ents us with a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on, and who&s;e labours with a food whole&s;ome and delicious; but were you to look into the hi&s;tory of the minute&s;t in&s;ects, you would be &s;en&s;ible that this wonderful property is not be&s;towed parti|ally;

<HEAD>THE SPIDER:</HEAD>
<P>"A &s;pider," exclaimed Clara, &s;tarting on one &s;ide&mdash;"I am &s;o frightened!"</P>
<P>"Do not alarm your&s;elves, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "I am not going to put the poor thing upon you, and I am &s;ure it will &s;ooner run from you, than to you."</P>
<P>"O," &s;aid Clara, "I am &s;o terrified! I have &s;uch an aver&s;ion to &s;piders!"</P>
<P>"On what account, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mills? "Let us take the other path, and talk this matter coolly over. Tell me from what does your aver&s;ion to the&s;e in|offen&s;ive in&s;ects ari&s;e?"</P>
<P>"O la! aunt, I can't tell; they are &s;uch ugly creatures, the very thought of them makes me &s;hudder."</P>
<P>"But, my dear child, if you have no better rea&s;on for di&s;liking them, you mu&s;t allow me to &s;ay, it is a prejudice which a little re&s;olution would enable you to &s;ur|mount."</P>
<P>"O aunt," replied Clara, "it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever endure the &s;ight of a &s;pider:
<PB N="55" REF="030966_0058_0FEA0CC7EFCD78F8">
I took a di&s;like to them when I was a very little girl; and I am certain, if one was to be put upon me, I &s;hould fall into fits."</P>
<P>"If you think &s;o," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "it is your duty to &s;urmount a prejudice, acci|dent might render &s;o fatal to you."</P>
<P>"O dear," &s;aid Clara, "it would be in vain for me to try; when people have &s;uch an antipathy to a thing, it is impo&s;&s;ible to overcome it."</P>
<P>"If I convince you," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "that it is po&s;&s;ible to overcome &s;uch an antipathy, will you promi&s;e me to u&s;e your endeavours to get the better of your di&s;|like to &s;piders?"</P>
<P>"I have the greate&s;t opinion of what you &s;ay, Madam," &s;aid Clara, "but I own, I do not think you will ever convince me it is po&s;&s;ible to overcome a di&s;like where it is &s;o &s;trong as mine to &s;piders."</P>
<P>"But, if you <HI>&s;hould</HI> be convinced, will you promi&s;e me to u&s;e your endeavours?"</P>
<P>"If you de&s;ire it, Madam."</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "I will recount an anecdote that mu&s;t convince you an antipathy is really to be overcome."</P>
<P>"O," &s;aid William, drawing clo&s;e to his aunt, "I am glad we are going to have a &s;tory: I do &s;o love &s;tories!"</P>
<P>"This I am going to relate," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "has the merit of truth: you have,
<PB N="56" REF="030966_0059_0FEA0CCACCED1118">
without doubt, heard of Peter the Great, Czar of Mu&s;covy."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied William; "he founded the city of Peter&s;burg."</P>
<P>"He did &s;o," replied Mrs. Mills, "and enacted many u&s;eful laws, which ju&s;tly ac|quired him the &s;urname of Great. But to my &s;tory: This great man, in his child|hood, had &s;o great an antipathy to water, that he could not endure to approach even within &s;ight of it."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Clara, "that was the mo&s;t &s;trange antipathy I ever heard of: how ridiculous! to be afraid of water!"</P>
<P>"Pardon me, my dear girl," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "if I cannot &s;ee any thing more ab&s;urd, in the Czar's antipathy to water, than in yours to a &s;pider&mdash;but, however, you &s;hall hear my &s;tory. This antipathy, which mu&s;t have been an in&s;uperable bar to all his warlike atchievements."&mdash;</P>
<P>"How &s;o, aunt," interrupted William; "I do not comprehend what his di&s;like to water had to do with his battles."</P>
<P>"I &s;ee, William," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "&s;mi|ling, that you are no &s;oldier; do you ima|gine he could make one campaign, without having occa&s;ion to pa&s;s a river, or at lea&s;t, to encamp on the banks of it, which, was almo&s;t as dreadful to him?"</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="030966_0060_0FEA0CCDF71DCD60">
"To be &s;ure he could not," &s;aid Wil|liam, "&s;triking his forehead, what a fool I was!</P>
<P>"Well," rejoined Mrs. Mills, "this infirmity, which would have given his ene|mies &s;o evident an advantage over him was happily overcome by the addre&s;s of one of his courtiers."</P>
<P>"One fine day, Prince Galliezin, his governor, and chief favourite, per&s;uaded him to ride into the country, upon a hunting party, without informing him, there was a brook near the place. After a little diver&s;ion, the favourite cried, what, hot weather! O that there was a river at hand, that I might jump in and bathe! How &s;aid the young Czar, would you kill your&s;elf? Galliezin an&s;wered, I have fre|quently bathed with your father, and yet your maje&s;ty &s;ees me alive. Nothing can be more whole&s;ome in &s;ultry weather. The Czar was &s;urprized, and coldly re|plied, I have heard, that people are fre|quently drowned. Ay, &s;aid the favourite, but not in water &s;carcely &s;o high as one's knees. If you plea&s;e, &s;ir, I will &s;end &s;ome body to look for a &s;tream, that you may &s;ee it po&s;&s;ible to bathe without drowning. The brook was ea&s;ily found; the Czar rode toward it trembling, and &s;topped his hor&s;e at a di&s;tance. Galliezen ordered
<PB N="58" REF="030966_0061_0FEA0CCF9F02ACC8">
&s;ome men to cro&s;s it backward and for|ward, on hor&s;eback; upon which, the Czar ventured to ride nearer. Galliezen &s;ee|ing this, rode through him&s;elf, and order|ed &s;ome of his people to cro&s;s it. They did; the Czar admired at what he &s;aw: but, at la&s;t, had the courage to ride his own hor&s;e over: Plea&s;ed at what he had performed, he from that time, u&s;ed him|&s;elf to the water, till by degrees, he got rid of this trouble&s;ome antipathy, which was occa&s;ioned by a fright, in his infan|cy." "Well, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "is it, or is it not po&s;&s;ible to overcome an aver&s;ion?"</P>
<P>"There is no arguing again&s;t facts &s;o convincing," &s;aid Clara, "if this &s;tory is true&mdash;</P>
<P>It is recorded in the life of Peter the Great, interrupted Mrs. Mills, if it will afford you the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction, I will &s;hew it you when we return to the hou&s;e, nearly in the words I have related it. Dear Madam, &s;aid Clara, you cannot think I doubt what you &s;ay.</P>
<P>"Well then, &s;aid Mrs. Mills, I may claim your promi&s;e."</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Clara, but I have &s;uch a di&s;like to a &s;pider! I have always avoided them, and Jane, my mamma's maid, know|ing how terrified I was, was always up|on
<PB N="59" REF="030966_0062_0FEA0CD18BABAFA8">
the look out, that I might not be a|larmed.</P>
<P>"The&s;e very precautions, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "have increa&s;ed your di&s;like; by con&s;tantly avoiding the &s;ight of the object, which di&s;gu&s;ts you, your imagination has painted its deformity great|er than the reality.</P>
<P>"La! &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid William, "there is no harm in a &s;pider: you may ea&s;ily get the better of &s;uch fooli&s;h di&s;like if you try; let me go and fetch one; you &s;hall &s;ee me handle it; I am not afraid.</P>
<P>"Oh for heaven &s;ake," &s;aid Clara, catch|ing hold of him, and turning pale with ter|ror, "&s;top."</P>
<P>"Hold William," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "be not in &s;uch ha&s;te."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "I have done, I only wanted to u&s;e my &s;i&s;ter to a &s;pider; if once &s;he could be per&s;uaded to touch one, the bu&s;ine&s;s would be done.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t remember, William," re|plied Mrs. Mills, "that the courtier, who &s;o happily cured the infirmity of Peter the Great, acted with &s;ome addre&s;s; had he, in&s;tead of inviting him to enjoy the cool|ne&s;s of the river, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uddenly plunged him into it, 'tis probable he would have &s;trengthened, in&s;tead of &s;urmounting his prejudice.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="030966_0063_0FEA0CD63A776C28">
I remember a per&s;on who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">its to the day of her death, from a frog, to which &s;he had a particular di&s;like, being in je&s;t, put upon her neck. People who commit this &s;ort of violence, on the feelings of others, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, (I do not mean that it is your ca&s;e William), are rather de|&s;irous of diverting them&s;elves, than of be|nefiting their friends.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething very inhuman in thus &s;porting with the infirmities of others; but let us take the next path.</P>
<P>"But the &s;pider, aunt," &s;aid Clara, alarm|ed,&mdash;"we mu&s;t pa&s;s &s;o clo&s;e&mdash;indeed, I cannot venture."</P>
<P>"Nay, now, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "do not yield to an idle conceit, which your better judgment mu&s;t condemn; re|collect, that you are not going to encoun|ter a Hyaena, or a Rhinoceros, but to look upon an inoffen&s;ive in&s;ect, to who&s;e exi&s;|tence, it is in your power, in an in&s;tant to put an end, and who&s;e ingenuity is de|&s;erving your highe&s;t admiration."</P>
<P>"But may I be &s;ure, madam, that you will not &s;uffer it to crawl upon me," &s;aid Clara; "and that you, William, will not play me any trick?" "I will engage for William," replied Mrs. Mills, "and &s;ure|ly, you may rely upon me, after what I have &s;aid."</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="030966_0064_0FEA0CD833A11E08">
"Well then;" &s;aid Clara, "but let me go on this &s;ide&mdash;now be &s;ure, William, you do not play me any trick."</P>
<P>"Not I," &s;aid William; "but you mu&s;t not be angry, if I cannot help laugh|ing to &s;ee you &s;o fooli&s;h." They now came in &s;ight of the bu&s;h, where the poor &s;pider, little con&s;cious of the terror it in&s;pired, had half formed its curious web. When Cla|ra beheld it, with &s;uch agility, run from &s;ide to &s;ide of the branch, upon which it was weaving its &s;ubtile &s;nare, &s;he &s;tarted back, and it was &s;ome time before &s;he could be prevailed upon to advance: how|ever, encouraged by Mrs. Mills, and a lit|tle a&s;hamed by the raillery of her brother, &s;he approached &s;o near, as to &s;ee di&s;tinctly the whole progre&s;s of its ingenious labours. At fir&s;t, her heart beat&mdash;&s;he declared it made her &s;hudder,&mdash;&s;he had never, in her life, looked &s;o long upon a &s;pider&mdash;by de|grees, &s;he became more calm, and at length, prote&s;ted, it was not &s;o ugly as &s;he imagi|ned&mdash;really, the body was very hand&s;ome|ly &s;peckled, and as for the web, it was a&s;|toni&s;hing from whence the thread, with which it was woven, could come." "The &s;pider," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "has, at the ex|tremity of her body, five openings, through which &s;he di&s;tills at plea&s;ure, a clammy glew: this forms the thread, which length|ens
<PB N="62" REF="030966_0065_0FEA0CDA00E25180">
in proportion to her di&s;tance, from the place where &s;he fir&s;t fa&s;tens it. When &s;he clo&s;es the&s;e openings, the thread, no longer extends, and &s;he remains &s;u&s;pended in the air. Ob&s;erve, Clara, &s;he makes u&s;e of the thread, for her a&s;cent, gra&s;ping it in her paws, as we &s;hould a rope with our hands and feet."</P>
<P>"Well, really," &s;aid Clara, "it is very curious, I &s;hould like to &s;ee in what manner the web is fir&s;t begun; this is half fini&s;hed."</P>
<P>"It will be well worth your attention, at another opportunity," &s;aid Mrs. Mills.</P>
<P>"Is the web begun in the middle?" a&s;ked Clara.</P>
<P>"That cannot be practicable," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "you &s;ee it is &s;u&s;pended between two branches, the &s;pider, therefore, would have no re&s;ting place."</P>
<P>"Very true, aunt," &s;aid William, "I never thought about it before, but really, I cannot conceive, in what part of the web, the &s;pider can po&s;&s;ibly begin."</P>
<P>"It is a que&s;tion," replied Mrs. Mills, "that might have puzzled wi&s;er heads than yours William, had not experience and ob&s;ervations fully di&s;covered it. When the garden &s;pider, for there are many kinds of &s;piders, begins its web, it places it&s;elf upon the end of a branch, and there fa&s;tens &s;everal threads, which it lengthens to two
<PB N="63" REF="030966_0066_0FEA0CDD03ECDE18">
or more ells, leaving them to float in the air: the&s;e threads are wafted by the wind, from one &s;ide to another, and lodged either on a hou&s;e, pole, or the oppo&s;ite branch, where they are fa&s;tened by their natural glew. The &s;pider then draws them to her, to try that they be well fixed, and they be|come a bridge for her to pa&s;s and repa&s;s at plea&s;ure; &s;he then marches to the middle of this thread, and adds to it another, by the help of which &s;he de&s;cends, till &s;he meets with a &s;olid body to re&s;t upon, or leaves it as the fir&s;t floating in the air, to the direction of chance; in the &s;ame manner other threads are drawn from the centre, and there again, as you &s;ee, cro&s;&s;ed. But I will leave the re&s;t to your own ob&s;ervation, which will imform you more agreeably."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "it mu&s;t be owned the &s;pider is a very ingenious creature; I &s;hould have puzzled my head for a month, and not gue&s;&s;ed how &s;he began her web."</P>
<P>"Nor I," &s;aid Clara, "but pray Madam, what is the u&s;e of the web, when it is made?"</P>
<P>"Why," &s;aid William, bur&s;ting into a fit of laughter, "don't you know, that &s;pi|ders &s;pread their webs to catch flies?"</P>
<P>"If I had known," replied Clara &s;ome|what piqued, "I &s;hould not have a&s;ked the que&s;tion."</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="030966_0067_0FEA0CDF63105568">
"There is no di&s;grace," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "in not knowing a thing, the di&s;grace is in not wi&s;hing to be informed."</P>
<P>"I did not mean to offend my &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid William, "only it was &s;o droll, to hear her a&s;k, what &s;piders &s;pread their webs for."</P>
<P>"You know William," &s;aid Clara, "that my mamma always ordered the &s;er|vants to take particular care, that I &s;hould not be alarmed, with the &s;ight of a &s;pider, &s;o you need not be &s;o very &s;harp upon me."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "I beg your par|don, &s;i&s;ter, I will be more careful in fu|ture."</P>
<P>And do &s;piders really feed on flies, Madam? "Undoubtedly," &s;aid Mrs. Mills.</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid Clara, "if the &s;pider is an ingenious creature, you mu&s;t allow that &s;he is very cruel."</P>
<P>"Pray, my dear, what do you under&s;tand by the word <HI>cruelty?"</HI></P>
<P>"Why," &s;aid Clara, "I think it is cruel to put an innocent thing to death."</P>
<P>"By cruelty," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "I under|&s;tand, that depraved inclination which cau|&s;es us to inflict a pang wantonly; or unne|ce&s;&s;arily to deprive any creature of life: now the &s;pider &s;eizes the prey which nature has made nece&s;&s;ary to her exi&s;tence; &s;he cannot, than, any more be chargeable with cruelty, than other animals, man him&s;elf, not except|ed,
<PB N="65" REF="030966_0068_0FEA0CE237B87720">
for who&s;e u&s;e innumerable creatures are daily doomed to &s;uffer.

<P>However, if you accu&s;e the &s;pider of cru|elty, &s;he has one quality, which cannot fail of meeting your approbation; I mean her attention to her young, which is &s;o great, that &s;he will incur every danger &s;ooner than for&s;ake them. She carefully wraps her eggs in a web of a&s;toni&s;hing &s;trength, which &s;he fa&s;tens to a wall, or a leaf, and watches with unremitted &s;olicitude: if danger is at hand, her fir&s;t care is to pull down the &s;acred de|po&s;ite and e&s;cape with it. There is one kind of &s;pider, which has recour&s;e to a very in|genious expedient for the pre&s;ervation of her eggs, &s;he &s;u&s;pends her bag eggs in &s;ome little aperture, perhaps of a wall, by a thread, and before them in the &s;ame manner, a little packet of dried leaves, which, by con&s;tant|ly &s;winging about at the entrance, prevent the birds and wa&s;ps, who are upon the watch for the eggs, from di&s;covering them."</P>
<P>Well, that is indeed an ingenious contri|vance</P>

<P>"Indeed, Madam," &s;aid Clara, "I am; and feel &s;o far reconciled to the &s;ight of what I once &s;o much dreaded, that I think, in time, it might be po&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ee a &s;pider crawling on my hand, with as little concern as I have felt in hearing it named."</P>
<P>"You &s;ee, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "what a little re&s;olution and proper reflec|tion will accompli&s;h; but to this habit, which, in the&s;e ca&s;es, is often more power|ful than rea&s;on it&s;elf, mu&s;t be joined by fre|quently accu&s;toming your&s;elf to look at, and examine a &s;pider, when you con&s;ider that its deformities will grow familiar, and your di&s;gu&s;t wear away."</P>

"I found it," replied William, "at the foot of this tree. Pray Madam, continued he, turning to his aunt, is not this the caterpil|lar, that changes to the peacock butterfly?"</P>
<P>"It is," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "and is proba|bly preparing for its change."</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t be a very curious change," &s;aid Clara: "it puts one in mind of the trans|formations, one reads of, in the tales of the fairies."</P>
<P>"I know of nothing recorded in tales of the fairies," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "more won|derful than the operations of nature, but familiarity cau&s;es us too often to view the mo&s;t intere&s;ting objects with indifference."</P>
<P>"But pray, Madam." &s;aid Clara, "is it not &s;trange, that one never &s;ees a caterpillar actually changing into a butterfly?"</P>
<P>"When we return to the garden," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "I dare &s;ay, William will gra|tify you with the &s;ight of a Chry&s;alis."</P>

<P>"How wonderful," &s;aid Clara! "but pray, Madam, do &s;ilk worms undergo any change?"</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="030966_0072_0FEA0CED9DC1D7F8">
"The &s;ilk worm," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "changes to a moth, in the &s;ame manner as the caterpillar does into a butterfly: there is a great re&s;emblance between the &s;ilk worm and tho&s;e caterpillars which &s;pin them&s;elves a covering."</P>
<P>"Ah," &s;aid William, "but &s;ilk worms are of &s;ome u&s;e; we are obliged to them for all the fine &s;ilks we admire; as for caterpil|lars, they are good for nothing."</P>
<P>"I am very ready," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "to acknowledge all our obligations to the &s;ilk worm; but &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;uppo&s;e for a moment, that infinate Wi&s;dom has formed the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant creatures in vain."</P>
<P>"Why, madam," &s;aid William, "of what u&s;e can caterpillars be? I am &s;ure I have heard our gardener &s;ay that they injure the trees and plants very much."</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t be owned," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "that our trees and plants &s;ometimes &s;uffer from the vi&s;its of the&s;e in&s;ects; but then a|gain it mu&s;t be remembered, that the poor birds, as well tho&s;e which &s;upply our table as tho&s;e which delight us with their &s;ong, would &s;uffer &s;till more &s;everely from their ab&s;ence."</P>
<P>"How &s;o, aunt?"</P>
<P>"Caterpillars and worms," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "are the food of young birds: the parents do not for&s;ake their egg till the fields

are repleni&s;hed with the&s;e in&s;ects, which di&s;appear when the earth is covered with grain and other provi&s;ion, and the young brood has acquired &s;trength to dige&s;t it. You mu&s;t allow, that the caterpillar, who furni&s;hes &s;upport for the young birds, has, in its turn, a title al&s;o to &s;upport; and this it finds in the plants and verdure of the earth: its depredations, to our imperfect view, may &s;ometimes alarm, but that wi&s;e Being who formed, and knows to what u&s;e he has a&s;&s;igned the creature, knows when to permit and when to &s;et bounds to its rava|ges."</P>
<P>Our party, mutually plea&s;ed with each other, had &s;trolled con&s;iderably further than they at fir&s;t de&s;igned: They had for &s;ome time left Mrs. Mills's enclo&s;ures, and were proceeding down a &s;hady lane that led to the village, when their ears were a&s;&s;ailed by the noi&s;e of &s;everal hammers which pro|ceeded from a black&s;mith's &s;hop. Mrs. Mills in vain endeavoured to rai&s;e her voice, and the young people to attend, the nearer they approached, the louder were the &s;ounds, which encrea&s;ed, till &s;ilence was at la&s;t all that could be oppo&s;ed to them.</P>
<P>Clara, who was extremely intere&s;ted in her aunt's di&s;cour&s;e, was much di&s;concerted at the interuption: and, as &s;oon as &s;he could make her&s;elf under&s;tood, declared, with

&s;ome impatience, that &s;uch trades were quite a nui&s;ance, and ought not to be &s;uffered.</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid William, "do not be too &s;evere, &s;i&s;ter; the noi&s;e of a black|&s;mith's hammer is not &s;o bad as the &s;mell of a tanner's pits."</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure," &s;aid Clara, "no &s;mell can be &s;o in&s;upportable as the horrid din of tho&s;e abominable hammers; I declare, we are not yet beyond the &s;ound of them, they have put every thing my aunt was telling us a|bout the caterpillars out of my head."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "both the tanner and black&s;mith are bad enough, to be &s;ure; you would &s;ay &s;o, Clara, if you were as con|&s;tantly regaled with the &s;mell of the &s;tinking hides as we are at &s;chool: There are ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|pits adjoining to our play-ground, at Mr. Markum's.

<P>"I am quite of your opinion, brother," replied Clara, "they are quite a nui&s;ance."</P>
<P>Mrs. Mills, perceiving they had nearly exhau&s;ted their rage again&s;t the poor tanner and black&s;mith, now broke the &s;ilence &s;he had for &s;ome time kept. "You think then," &s;aid &s;he, "that every per&s;on of con&s;equence &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s the hone&s;t black&s;mith and tanner from their e&s;tate?"</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="030966_0075_0FEA0CF346A64540">
"Indeed, aunt, we do," replied Clara; trades that are &s;uch a nui&s;ance &s;hould not be encouraged."</P>
<P>"I am afraid then," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "the &s;aw and mallet of the carpenter, the chi&s;|&s;el of the ma&s;on, the grind&s;tone of the cut|ler, and the appendages of many u&s;eful trades, will give the profe&s;&s;ors little chance of your favor, in &s;hort, were I to judge by your im|patience, at the &s;mall inconvenience you have &s;u&s;tained from the tanner and black|&s;mith, I &s;hould predict that the mechanic arts, in general, would not find a warm friend in either."</P>
<P>"No, aunt," &s;aid William, "we do not &s;ay that we &s;hould di&s;card all; but &s;ome, you mu&s;t allow, are le&s;s u&s;eful and more di&s;|agreeable than others."</P>
<P>"All, my dear William, are u&s;eful in their turn; none more &s;o than tho&s;e which you de&s;pi&s;e: were examples wanting to prove what daily experience &s;o clearly de|mon&s;trates, I could relate a circum&s;tance, in which their utility was proved in a very critical &s;ituation."</P>
<P>"Dear aunt, do relate it," exclaimed the young people.</P>
<P>"My dears, it is a narrative of &s;ome length and we are already at home."</P>
<P>"Nay, now you have rai&s;ed our curio&s;i|ty."</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="030966_0076_0FEA0CF7C0A106A8">
"Well," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, ever ready to oblige, "when we get home, I will look a|mong my papers for an extract I made of the circum&s;tance; and, after dinner, read it."</P>
<P>At this moment the door opened, and they &s;eperated to dre&s;s for dinner.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Clara to her brother, whom on her return, &s;he found alone in the dining parlour, "Who could have thought that al|mo&s;t two whole days could have been &s;pent &s;o agreeably in this &s;olitary place, without any other company than one's aunt!"</P>
<P>"Ah," &s;aid William, "who could have thought it!"</P>
<P>"I declare I have not yet," &s;aid Clara, "found one hour tedious: My aunt is a charming woman; my papa &s;aid &s;o, but I did not believe him. I already begin to love her dearly, &s;he is &s;o kind and agreeable."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied William, "&s;he has always &s;omething new to tell us; but hu&s;h&mdash;.</P>
<P>The entrance of Mrs. Mills broke off the di&s;cour&s;e, and dinner &s;oon after followed.</P>

<P>On the 23d of April, 1755, the Doding|ton, a &s;hip belonging to the Ea&s;t India Com|pany, &s;ailed from the Downs, and on the 17th of July following, about one in the morning, &s;truck on a rock di&s;tant, ea&s;t from the Cape of Good Hope, about 250 leagues. Of 270 &s;ouls that were on board when the &s;hip &s;truck, 23 only e&s;caped to the &s;hore, which was a barren uninhabited rock, ap|parantly capable of affording them but a temporary &s;uccour. Their fir&s;t care, was to &s;earch among the things, which the vio|lence of the &s;ea had thrown upon the rocks, for &s;omething to cover them, and in this, they &s;ucceeded beyond their hopes. They next felt the want of fire, which was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;upplied: Some attempted to kindle two pieces of wood, by rubbing them toge|ther, while others were &s;earching among the rocks, in hopes of picking up &s;omething to &s;erve for a flint and &s;teel. After a long &s;earch, a box containing two gun flints, and a broken file, was found; this was a joyful acqui&s;ition, but &s;till, till &s;omething like tin|der could be procured, the flints and &s;teel
<PB N="75" REF="030966_0078_0FEA0CFD6C127498">
were u&s;ele&s;s; a further, &s;earch was there|fore undertaken, with inexpre&s;&s;ible anxiety; and at la&s;t, a ca&s;k of gun-powder was di&s;|covered; but this, to their great di&s;|appointment, proved to be wet: a &s;mall quantity, however, that had &s;uffered no da|mage, upon a clo&s;e examination, was found at the bottom of the ca&s;k. Some of this, they brui&s;ed on a linen rag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> which &s;erved very well for tinder, and a fire was &s;oon made. The wounded gathered around it, and the re&s;t went in &s;earch of other nece&s;&s;a|ries, without which, the rock could afford them but a &s;hort re&s;pite from de&s;truction. In the afternoon, (for the &s;hip &s;truck about 3 in the morning) a box of wax candles, and a ca&s;k of brandy, were brought in, and &s;oon after, &s;ome others of the party return|ed with an account, that they had di&s;cover|ed a ca&s;k almo&s;t full of fre&s;h water, which was even more welcome than the brandy. The chief mate brought in &s;ome pieces of &s;alt pork, and &s;oon after others arrived, dri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing before them &s;even hogs, which had come on &s;hore alive. The approach of night, made it nece&s;&s;ary to provide &s;ome &s;helter; all hands were employed, and a tent was at la&s;t made of &s;ome canva&s;s that had been thrown a&s;hore, though it was &s;o &s;mall, for want of more &s;ail cloth, that it would not hold them all. They were obliged to e|rect
<PB N="76" REF="030966_0079_0FEA0CFFCE735740">
their tent upon the highe&s;t part of the i&s;land, from fear of being overflowed; and this was covered with the dung of a large kind of water fowl, called a gannet, by which the i&s;land was much frequented. As they had pa&s;&s;ed the day, without food, they had pa&s;&s;ed the night without re&s;t, being &s;unk a foot in the fowls dung, and the fire con&s;tantly being extingui&s;hed, by the tem|tempe&s;tuou&s;ne&s;s of the night.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>The next day the company were cal|led together, to eat their fir&s;t meal, and &s;ome ra&s;hers of pork were broiled upon the coals for dinner. The &s;itting thus di&s;con&s;olate and forlorn down to a repa&s;t they had been u&s;ed to &s;hare in convivial cheerfulne&s;s, &s;truck them with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their condition, that they bur&s;t into pa&s;&s;ionate lamentations, wringing their hands, and looking round them with all the wildne&s;s of di&s;pair; in &s;uch a tumult of mind, the thoughts naturally hurry from one &s;ubject to another, to fix, if po&s;&s;ible, upon &s;omething that may afford comfort: one of the company recollected that the carpenter was among them, and &s;ugge&s;ted to the re&s;t, as a &s;ubject of hope, that, with his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it might be po&s;&s;ible to build a &s;trong &s;loop, if tools and materi|als could be procured.</P>
<P>Every one's attention was immediately turned upon the carpenter, who declared
<PB N="77" REF="030966_0080_0FEA0D01651ED690">
he had no doubt he &s;hould be able to build a &s;loop that would carry them to &s;ome port of &s;afety, if tools and materials could be found.</P>
<P>At that time they had no rational pro|&s;pect of procuring either; yet they had no &s;ooner placed their deliverance, one remove beyond total impo&s;&s;ibility, than they &s;eemed to think it neither improbable nor difficult; they began to eat without repining, and from that moment the boat engro&s;&s;ed their whole conver&s;ation. As &s;oon as they had fini&s;hed their repa&s;t, &s;ome went in &s;earch of tools, which were, however not that day to be found, and others to mend the tent. The next day they &s;ecured four butts of water, a ca&s;k of flour, a hog&s;head of brandy, and one of their little boats, which had been thrown up by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide, in a &s;hattered condi|tion. Hitherto they had found no tools, excepting a &s;craper; but the day after, they had the good fortune to find a hamper, in which were files, &s;ail needles, gimlets, and an azimuth compa&s;s-card. They al&s;o found two quadrants, a carpenter's adze, a chi&s;el, three &s;word blades, &s;ome timber, plank, can|va&s;s and cordage. The&s;e they &s;ecured with great joy, though they were in want of ma|ny implements, without which, it was im|po&s;&s;ible for the carpenter to work: he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed a &s;aw, but had neither hammer nor nails. In this dilemma, it happened
<PB N="78" REF="030966_0081_0FEA0D055D286E88">
that one of the &s;eamen, a Swede by birth, picked up an old pair of bellows, and bring|ing them to his companions, told them he had been by profe&s;&s;ion a &s;mith, and that, with the&s;e bellows, and a forge, which he hoped, by his direction, they would be able to build, he could furni&s;h the carpenter with all the tools he could want, nails included, as plenty of iron might be obtained, by burning the timber, which had come on &s;hore from the wreck. This account was receiv|ed with tran&s;port of joy: the &s;mith imme|diately applied him&s;elf to mending the bel|lows, and the three following days were &s;pent in building a tent, and a forge; in bringing together the timber and plank for the u&s;e of the carpenter, who was in the mean time bu&s;y in getting ready the few tools he had, that he might begin the boat as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible: this, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the quarter-ma|&s;ter, he did the next day; the &s;mith al&s;o fi|ni&s;hed his forge, laid in a quantity of fir for fuel, and from this day they both continu|ed to work with indefatigable diligence, ex|cept when prevented by the weather. The &s;mith having fortunately found the ring and nut of a bower anchor which &s;erved him for an anvil, &s;upplied chi&s;els, axes, ham|mers, and nails as they were wanted; and the carpenter u&s;ed them with great dexte|rity and di&s;patch, till the 31&s;t, when he
<PB N="79" REF="030966_0082_0FEA0D0701D82718">
fell &s;ick. As the lives of the whole compa|ny depended upon his recovery, we may judge with what anxiety they awaited it; and with what un&s;peakable joy they beheld him, in a few days, &s;o far re&s;tored, as to re|turn to work.</P>
<P>In the mean time the &s;tores they had &s;aved from the wreck were &s;o nearly ex|hau&s;ted, that they came to an allowance of two ounces of bread a man per day; and had no &s;alt pork but what they determined to keep to victual the boat; for their e&s;cape &s;carcely depended le&s;s upon &s;ea &s;tores than on the &s;ails them&s;elves: their water al&s;o fell &s;hort. In this di&s;tre&s;s, they had recour&s;e to &s;everal expedients: they dug a well in hopes to find a &s;pring, but were di&s;appoint|ed: they atempted to knock down &s;ome of the gannets that &s;ettled upon the top of the rock, and in this they &s;ucceeded better; but found the fle&s;h very rank, and perfectly black. They al&s;o made a raft, or float, called a cata|maran, on which they purpo&s;ed to go out a fi&s;hing, with &s;uch hooks and lines as had come on &s;hore; and on the&s;e they had &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, till they were intimidated by an ac|cident from the further u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Mr. Colet, the &s;econd mate, and Mr. Yets, the mid&s;hipman, had been out one afternoon, till four o'clock, when they endeavoured to make to land: but the wind &s;uddenly blow|ing
<PB N="80" REF="030966_0083_0FEA0D0998062198">
to the we&s;t, they found that in&s;tead of approaching the &s;hore, they were driven ve|ry fa&s;t out to &s;ea. The people on &s;hore per|ceived their di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ent out another float to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the &s;urf was &s;o great that it over&s;et three times; and the men were obliged to &s;wim. In the mean time they &s;aw their friends driving out to &s;ea at a great rate; and were ju&s;t giving them up to de&s;truction, when the carpenter re|vived their hopes, by &s;ending them word that he would make the little boat (which the reader may recollect had been thrown on &s;hore in a &s;hattered condition) &s;o tight that it &s;hould not take in water fa&s;ter than one man could heave it out: this he di&s;|patched in a quarter of an hour; and every one being willing to venture out for the de|liverance of their friends, it &s;oon overtook the float, received the mate and his compa|nion on board, and returned &s;afe to &s;hore.</P>
<P>It was now thought dangerous to ven|ture out any more on the float: the carpen|ter, therefore, again went to work on the lit|tle boat, and put it into complete repair. In this they frequently took great quantities of fi&s;h. Three of the company al&s;o having di&s;|covered a great &s;moke on the main land, embarked in it, in hopes of making &s;ome di&s;|covery favourable to their &s;ituation: but having been out forty eight hours, lo&s;t one

<P>"In the mean while the whole company was thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation and alarm, by an accident that happened to the carpenter, who cut his leg in &s;uch a manner, that he was in great danger of bleed|ing to death. What anxiety, what alarm did not this occa&s;ion! They had no &s;urgeon among them, nor any thing proper to apply to the wound; yet under God, their exi&s;t|ence depended upon the life of the car|penter. However, with much difficulty, the blood was at length &s;taunched, and the wound healed without any bad &s;ymptom. Soon after this they found a fowling-piece, which was a great trea&s;ure; for though the barrel was much bent, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t-anchor, the carpenter &s;oon made it &s;ervi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">able, and u&s;ed it with great &s;ucce&s;s in &s;hooting the birds, which they had before no way of taking but by knocking them down with a &s;tick. About this time al&s;o they perceived the gannets, which had of late for&s;aken them, hover about the rock, on

which they &s;ettled to lay their eggs, to the great joy of the company, who were for &s;ome time con&s;tantly &s;upplied with them in great plenty. The carpenter and &s;mith, in the mean while continued to work upon the boat, and the people were bu&s;ied in collect|ing what was, from time to time, thrown up from the wreck; e&s;pecially cordage and canva&s;s, which was nece&s;&s;ary to rig the boat and &s;ome ca&s;ks of fre&s;h water. They had al&s;o fortunately &s;ome rainy weather, which proved very acceptable, as they contrived to &s;ave &s;ome of the water for &s;ea &s;tores; their e&s;cape &s;carcely depending le&s;s upon fre&s;h water than upon the &s;ails. But they were &s;till in want of bread, having lived many days on &s;hort allowance. As a la&s;t recour&s;e, they thought of building an oven, as they had &s;ome barrels of flour, though they had no bread, and &s;ucceeding beyond their expectations, they converted the flour into a tolerable bi&s;cuit. This was, however, at length &s;o nearly exhau&s;ted, that they were forced to live upon a few ounces a day, with|out brandy, of which there remained only a &s;mall quantity; and this they pre&s;erved inviolate for the u&s;e of the carpenter. Wa|ter was al&s;o &s;o &s;hort, that they were allow|ed only half a pint a day. In this conditi|on, however, they providentially, in a great degree, pre&s;erved their health and &s;trength;

and, on the 16th of February, launched their little bark, calling her The Happy De|liverance: On the 17th, they got their little pittance of &s;tores on board, and on the 18th, &s;et &s;ail from the rock, on which they had lived ju&s;t &s;even months, giving it at parting the name of the Bird I&s;land.</P></Q>
<P>"And was their voyage favourable?" a&s;ked William.</P>
<P>"They all," replied Mrs. Mills, "happi|ly arrived, without accident, at the place of their de&s;tination."</P>
<P>"What a providential e&s;cape!" &s;aid Clara; "they owed it entirely to the carpenter and &s;mith."</P>

<P><PB N="84" REF="030966_0087_0FEA0D13C2C30800">
"Why," replied William, "he is one of the boys at our &s;chool; his father is worth a deal of money, but he is an ironmonger; &s;o, as Charles is the only trade&s;man's &s;on a|mong us, all the boys make game of him, and many will not keep him company; though, to &s;ay the truth, he is as genteel as any of us, and takes his learning as well."</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "to hear that you were capable of joining in &s;uch il|liberal conduct: I know of no other di&s;tinc|tion between the gentleman and the com|mon man than that of the heart, manners, and under&s;tanding."</P>
<P>"Why, aunt," &s;aid William, "I own I have been &s;ometimes a&s;hamed, but at &s;chool one mu&s;t do as the others do; the great boys lead, and the little ones follow."</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "that you have betrayed a very cowardly &s;pirit, in being afraid of re&s;i&s;ting what you know to be wrong, merely becau&s;e others were ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or weak enough to &s;et you the example."</P>

To-morrow, after dinner, I will illu&s;trate my ob&s;ervation, by a &s;tory, which I think will afford you &s;ome entertainment."</P>

<P>"But cannot we have it now, dear ma|dam?"</P>
<P>"It is nearly tea time," replied Mrs. Mills.</P>
<P>"Very true," &s;aid William, "and we mu&s;t not forget the micro&s;cope."</P>

<P>"But what do you think of my auricu|las!" &s;aid Mrs. Mills, pointing to a beauti|ful a&s;&s;emblage on her left hand.</P>
<P>"O, they are charming!" exclaimed Clara.</P>
<P>"Do you think, aunt," rejoined Willi|am, "that any other country be&s;ides Eng|land can &s;hew &s;uch a number of beautiful flowers; there is no end of their variety?"</P>
<P>"It is certainly very great," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "but we mu&s;t not forget that we are
<PB N="87" REF="030966_0090_0FEA0D1921A85540">
indebted to other climates for that beauty and variety."</P>
<P>"How, aunt," "&s;aid William; "are not the&s;e flowers the growth of our own country?"</P>
<P>"They undoubtedly grow here," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "and, as you &s;ee, thrive; but no plant can properly be called the natural pro|duce of a country that will not grow with|out pains of culture, which you know few of vegetables or garden flowers will. For the auricula we are indebted to Caira; for the tulip to Cappadocia, a province of Per|&s;ia the pink and carnation come from Italy; the lily from Syria; the tubero&s;e from Java and Ceyland, i&s;lands in the Indian Ocean; and the delicate fragrant je&s;&s;amine, which I am &s;ure we all admire, is a native of the Ea&s;t Indies.

<P>"Well, aunt," &s;aid William, "there is one thing, however, in which Old England I think may glory; and that is in her fields of corn: they are certainly her own."</P>
<P>"I &s;ee," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, &s;miling, "that William is willing to &s;tand up for the con&s;e|quence of his country; but, my dear fellow, rye and wheat grow wild in Tartary and Siberia, but require a deal of culture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re

<P>"Well, aunt," &s;aid William, "I am &s;ure neither Tartary nor Siberia can &s;hew finer fields of corn than we pa&s;&s;ed through ye&s;terday."</P>
<P>"There I agree with you," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "the &s;oil of Engla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d is extremely well adapted to the culture of corn, which it produces in &s;uch abundance, as not only to &s;upply its own inhabitants but other countries, to which great quantities are year|ly exported, as an article of commerce. Corn is neverthele&s;s of foreign origin, as in|deed are more of our vegetables and herb|age. The colliflower comes from Cyprus, an i&s;land in the Levant; a&s;paragus from A&s;ia; &s;harlots from Siberia; and hor&s;e-radi&s;h from China. Lentils we owe to France, and kidney-beans to the Ea&s;t Indies; garlic al&s;o is produced naturally in that part of the world. When America was fir&s;t di&s;cover|ed, which you know was in the year 1492, by Chri&s;topher Columbus, a number of plants and flowers were found there, till then unknown to the re&s;t of Europe, to dif|ferent parts of which they have been tran&s;|planted. We are obliged to Brazil, a pro|vince of South America, for that excellent and u&s;eful vegetable, the potatoe."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Clara, "I had no idea
<PB N="89" REF="030966_0092_0FEA0D1D6233F758">
that all our vegetables and flowers came from foreign countries."</P>
<P>"The &s;oil of each different country," re|&s;umed Mrs. Mills, "contains juices proper for the nouri&s;hment of the vegetables pecu|liar to it, and the&s;e, if deprived of &s;uch jui|ces, will naturally wither and die."</P>
<P>"How is it then," interrupted William, "that we have pinks, ro&s;es, and all the&s;e beautiful flowers and good vegetables, if they will not grow any where but in their own &s;oil?"</P>
<P>"I did not tell you," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "that they would not grow any where but in their native &s;oil, but that &s;uch juices were requi&s;ite to nouri&s;h them."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "that is pretty nearly the &s;ame."</P>
<P>"No;" replied Mrs. Mills, "it alters the ca&s;e very much."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t remember, my dear boy, that it is po&s;&s;ible for art to imitate nature; this is the province of the gardner, who by a mixture of different &s;orts of earth, clay, gravel, marl, chalk, &amp;c. prepares a &s;oil proper for the nouri&s;hment of the plant or vegetables, he means to fo&s;ter, and regulates the heat according to that which nature has made nece&s;&s;ary to it; and thus, as an ingenious author, who has, in part furni&s;hed the information I have ju&s;t given you, ob|&s;erves,

<P>"Every plant," my dear Clara, "replied Mrs. Mills, "is capable of choo&s;ing for it|&s;elf; the wi&s;e author of nature has provided each with a &s;et of ve&s;&s;els or fibres, that ea|gerly attract and admit tho&s;e juices that are proper for its nature and reject all other.</P>

<P>They then examined the wing it&s;elf, and perceived, that when the du&s;t was rubbed off, a thin &s;kin only remained perforated, with little holes, the actual &s;ockets, which contained the quills. "Well," &s;aid Clara, "this is indeed wonderful, I &s;ee the wing

<P>"But do you ob&s;erve," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "upon its head, two little immoveable cre&s;cents, &s;haped like a &s;plit pea, and upon the&s;e a number of minute eyes? each is fur|ni&s;hed with a &s;et of fibres or optic nerves."</P>

Mr. Weldon had a wife, four daughters, and a &s;on with the latter of whom Sir John was &s;o plea&s;ed, that he pro|po&s;ed, if it met his father's approbation, to educate him with his own &s;on.

Young Bentley was at this time nearly two years older than Charles, who had ju&s;t entered his twelfth year; he was the &s;ole &s;urviving hope of his family, and from his cradle had been &s;poiled by flattery and indulgence; unaccu&s;tomed to re&s;traint, his pa&s;&s;ions had gathered &s;trength, and though he had naturally good &s;en&s;e, and a heart hu|mane and affectionate, he &s;eldom li&s;tened to the &s;ugge&s;tion of the&s;e, but &s;acrificed every worthy principle to the whim that actuated him for the moment.

<P>At the reque&s;t of young Bentley, it was agreed that Charles &s;hould &s;pend the vacati|on with him: at the clo&s;e of the year, there|fore, the young people &s;et out together for Sir John's hou&s;e in London.</P>
<P>Edward, for that was young Bentley's name, was received with the greate&s;t joy and affection by his parents, who flattered them&s;elves, he was greatly improved; nor did they forget Charles, who&s;e heart beat with gratitude and plea&s;ure at the kind re|ception he experienced from his patron and Lady Bentley. The holidays &s;eemed to communicate equal joy both to him and his

friend, and for a week nothing but plea&s;ure was thought on. Young Bentley had his lit|tle parties at home and abroad; and Charles, unaccu&s;tomed to the gaity that &s;urrounded him, thought all happine&s;s and enchantment. Ten days elap&s;ed in this manner, when one morning, as he was entering a toy-&s;hop to execute his commi&s;&s;ion his friend Edward had given him, his eyes glanced upon fea|tures which &s;eemed familiar to him. Curio|&s;ity induced him to turn off the &s;tep, and fol|low the per&s;on who had thus tran&s;i|ently attracted his ob&s;ervation. It was a young woman, clean but meanly clothed, &s;upported upon crutches; in her counte|nance di&s;ea&s;e and want were &s;trongly pic|tured. Charles overtook her in an in&s;tant, and, as with difficulty &s;he dragged her weight along, wholly ab&s;orbed in her own mi&s;ery, looked &s;tedfa&s;tly upon her face. One while he thought him&s;elf mi&s;taken; another that it was impo&s;&s;ible for two faces &s;o &s;trong|ly to re&s;emble each other; at length re&s;olv|ed to &s;atisfy his doubts: "Catharine!" &s;aid he, in a tone of enquiry. The young wo|man looked up, and turning her hollow eyes upon Charles, in her turn, looked &s;tedfa&s;tly on him, and exclaimed at la&s;t: Gracious me! do I &s;ee Ma&s;ter Charles Weldon!</P></Q>
<P>"Ah, Catharine!" &s;aid Charles, kindly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ing her by the hand, "I little thought
<PB N="99" REF="030966_0102_0FE9FD10210840C8">
to have &s;een you reduced to this mi&s;erable &s;tate!"</P>
<P>"You &s;ee, my good young ma&s;ter," &s;aid the poor woman, "what &s;ickne&s;s and pover|ty can bring one to. Thank heaven I have little to reproach my&s;elf with. I am &s;till hone&s;t, and as long as I was able, was glad to work: but it has plea&s;ed God, for &s;ome wi&s;e end, to afflict me, and I &s;ubmit with patience."</P>
<P>"But where do you live Catharine?" &s;aid Charles. "Are you in place? Have you been long a cripple?"</P>
<P>"You know, ma&s;ter Charles," &s;aid Catha|rine, "that I left my ma&s;ter's and came up to town, thinking to better my&s;elf; but I repented it &s;ince. I &s;oon got into place, in|deed, and was liked very well by my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s; but when I was &s;eized with this rheumati&s;m, and could no longer do their bu&s;ine&s;s, it was not to be expected they would keep me: So I took my lodging down the &s;treet, you &s;ee yonder, where, by degrees, I parted with all my cloaths to &s;upport my&s;elf. My mi&s;tre&s;s was, indeed, very kind, and gave me money at different times; but, as I was not able to work, it was &s;oon gone. I have not a great &s;tomach, ma&s;ter Charles, but indeed I have many times known a want of the little I could have eaten."</P>
<P>"Poor &s;oul!" &s;aid Charles, his eyes filling
<PB N="100" REF="030966_0103_0FEA0D3652279D10">
with tears, "Why did you not let my fa|ther know of your di&s;tre&s;s? But is there no hope of your ever being re&s;tored to the u&s;e of your limbs?"</P>
<P>"None, &s;ir," returned Catharine, "un|le&s;s I could go to Bath: the charitable doc|tors who give me advice, &s;ay, that is the only thing that can re&s;tore me: but it is not for &s;uch a poor mi&s;erable creature, as I am, to think of &s;o long a journey. Where &s;hould I find money to bear the expence!"</P>
<P>"How I wi&s;h," &s;aid Charles, "that it were in my power to a&s;&s;i&s;t you! How much money, do you think, would take you to Bath?"</P>
<P>"Ah! &s;ir," &s;aid Catharine, "I am &s;o helple&s;s I could not attempt &s;o long a jour|ney with le&s;s than a guinea and a half: for nobody you know, ma&s;ter Charles, in a &s;trange place, would take me in, without I could fir&s;t pay down the money for a lodg|ing."</P>
<P>"And do you think," &s;aid Charles, "that a guinea and a half would do, Catha|rine?"</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;ir," replied Catharine, "I could make that do very well. You mu&s;t know, ma&s;ter Charles, there is a poor widow who lodges upon the &s;ame floor that I do: &s;he has been very kind to me in my di&s;tre&s;s. God knows I mu&s;t have &s;tarved if it had not been

for her. She is now going to live with her daughter, who keeps a &s;hop at Bath. To be &s;ure I was very &s;elfi&s;h; but indeed, ma|&s;ter Charles, it almo&s;t broke my heart when I heard I was to lo&s;e her. It then came into my head, that if I could but rai&s;e a little mo|ney to bear the expence of the journey, I might go with her, and &s;tand a chance of recovering the u&s;e of my poor limbs: and in ca&s;e I was not &s;o happy, I con&s;idered that, let the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t, I was a: likely to get a little needle-work there as here. This made me very anxious to go; and, at la&s;t I took heart, and determined to a&s;k my good mi&s;tre&s;s once more to &s;tand my friend: But what do you think, &s;ir, when I went to the hou&s;e, I found the whole family in grief and confu&s;ion: My poor mi&s;tre&s;s, two days ago, &s;uddenly dropt down dead. My la&s;t re&s;ource, therefore, has failed, and I am &s;en&s;ible that it is my duty to &s;ubmit patiently to the will of my Creator."</P>
<P>"But your friend is not gone!" &s;aid Charles, eagerly.</P>
<P>"She &s;ets out in the waggon to-morrow night," returned the poor woman with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ive eyes of Charles &s;parkled on this intelligence: "How happy am I," &s;aid he, "that I met you, and that it is in my power to a&s;&s;i&s;t you! Set your heart at re&s;t,

my good Catharine, you &s;hall go with your friend&mdash;I have a guinea and a half&mdash;How rejoiced I am that I &s;aved it!" Saying this, he put his hand to his pocket; but recollect|ing him&s;elf, "I have unluckily," he added, "changed my wai&s;tcoat this morning and have not the money about me. I will &s;tep home for it now; or, if it will make no dif|ference, bring it to you in the cour&s;e of a few hours."</P>
<P>"Oh! my dear young ma&s;ter," &s;aid Ca|therine, "you are too good.&mdash;But your pa|pa and mamma, will they give their con|&s;ent?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"My father and mother," interrupted Charles, "are not in town; if they were, I know they would a&s;&s;i&s;t you more than I can.&mdash;As to the money I &s;peak of it is my own, and I may do as I like with it. I &s;av|ed it to &s;pend in pre&s;ents for my &s;i&s;ters, when I returned into the country; but I know they will be better plea&s;ed to hear you have it, than with any pre&s;ents I could take them."</P>
<P>"And will you, indeed, be &s;o generous?" &s;aid the poor woman, who&s;e cheek was flu&s;hed with hope, "will you be &s;o generous to a poor creature, who can make no re|turn?"</P>
<P>"Say no more, my good Catharine," &s;aid Charles, "I am &s;ure the plea&s;ure I &s;hall have

in a&s;&s;i&s;ting you, will be greater than that you can conceive from the trifle it is in my pow|er to appropriate to your u&s;e. Tell me your direction, and depend upon &s;eeing me in a few hours."</P>
<P>"Ah! &s;ir," &s;aid Catharine, "God who has &s;ent you to my relief, will not &s;uffer your goodne&s;s to go unrewarded." Then having pointed out to him the hou&s;e where &s;he liv|ed, &s;he added, a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings go with you; and Charles having bid her farewel, was returning to the toy-&s;hop, when &s;tepping back a few paces, "you appear to walk in great pain, Catharine," &s;aid he, "let me guide you over this cro&s;&s;way; re&s;t upon my arm&mdash;there, do not hurry your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Oh! how good you are, ma&s;ter Charles," &s;aid Catharine,&mdash;"there are few young gen|tlemen like you."</P>
<P>"Nay," &s;aid Charles, "there is &s;urely no|thing &s;ingular in being commonly humane, and wi&s;hing to take care of one who has of|ten guided and taken care of me."&mdash;Then having conducted her to the end of the &s;treet where &s;he lived, he added, "good bye, Ca|tharine, depend upon &s;eeing me before night."</P>
<P>Charles now, in reality, repaired to the toy-&s;hop, where having executed his friend's commi&s;&s;ion, he returned home.</P>
<P>"Charles, my boy," &s;aid Edward, upon
<PB N="104" REF="030966_0107_0FEA0D415DEBD210">
his entrance, "I have ju&s;t hit on an excel|lent &s;cheme!"</P>
<P>"Have you," replied Charles, who was always happy when his friend was plea&s;ed: "what is it?"</P>
<P>"Why," &s;aid Edward, "you know my father and mother went out early this morn|ing: they are &s;ent for to a friend who is &s;ick, ten or fifteen miles off; &s;o we may be &s;ure they will not return till late in the even|ing."</P>
<P>"And what then?"</P>
<P>"It has ju&s;t come into my head, Charles, that we may have a nice canter."</P>
<P>"A canter;"</P>
<P>"Yes," returned the young gentleman, Lightfoot, my papa's hunter, is in the &s;table: I can ride him, and you can have the little black poney. Nothing could have happen|ed more lucky; there is a review at Black|heath; it will be a nice ride: and"&mdash;</P>
<P>"But have you a&s;ked leave, Edward?" interrupted Charles.</P>
<P>"That would have been to no purpo&s;e," returned the young gentleman; "you know my mother would have been frightened out of her wits at the thought of my mounting Lightfoot."</P>
<P>"Then how can you think of &s;uch a thing," &s;aid Charles; "be&s;ides, I now recollect hear|ing Sir John and my lady both de&s;ire you

would &s;tay at home to be ready for Mr. Ma|&s;on, the miniature painter, who, you know, is this afternoon to take your picture. I am &s;ure they would be extremely di&s;plea&s;ed were you to be out of the way."</P>
<P>"There now," &s;aid Edward, "I knew you would rai&s;e &s;ome objection: I never &s;et on foot any thing that you do not oppo&s;e."</P>
<P>"You do me great inju&s;tice, Edward," returned Charles; "you know I am never &s;o happy as when I can oblige you; but I love you too well, not to tell you when I &s;ee you do wrong; and, indeed Edward, you are much to blame to think of going out af|ter the &s;trict charge Sir John and my lady gave you to the contrary; and to take Light|foot will make it ten times wor&s;e. You &s;ay your mother would be frightened out of her wits were &s;he to know you mounted him&mdash;What do you think &s;he will &s;ay, when &s;he hears of your di&s;obedience?"</P>
<P>"She will know nothing of the matter," &s;aid Edward, "we &s;hall be home long e|nough before &s;he, or my father, or even the painter comes, and I warrant I will &s;top George's mouth: he will go with us, and will not blab for his own &s;ake."</P>
<P>"You have very indulgent parents, Ed|ward," &s;aid Charles, "and there is &s;ome|thing very mean in betraying their confi|dence; and then to draw the &s;ervant in"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="030966_0109_0FEA0D457508CC28">
"I think," returned Edward, &s;omewhat piqued at his friend's freedom, "that I know my duty as well as your&s;elf. Was it any thing of con&s;equence, I &s;hould be as &s;cru|pulous, for I think I love my father as well as you do your's."</P>
<P>"I do not di&s;pute that," &s;aid Charles; "nor mean, my dear Edward, to offend you; but merely to prevail upon you to give up this fooli&s;h &s;cheme. There will probably be another review before the holidays are over, and then, I dare &s;ay, your father will not have any objection to take you to it; but were you now to go, your plea&s;ure would be interrupted by the recollection that you are doing wrong, and the fear of being found out. You may meet &s;omebody you know; or twenty things that you do not think of may happen to di&s;cover it to Sir John."</P>
<P>"What a coward you are, Charles," re|turned Edward; "you have no &s;pirit, you are &s;uch a chicken-hearted fellow"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I have &s;pirit enough, Edward, when I know my cau&s;e is good"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well," interrupted the young gentleman, "I am &s;ure this is not a bad cau&s;e: as I told you before, if it was matter of con&s;equence, I &s;hould be more &s;crupulous; but what harm can there be in taking Lightfoot for a few hours? You know I have rode Mr. Shepherd's black Cae&s;ar before now, and I am &s;ure he had &s;pirit enough."</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="030966_0110_0FEA0D47E374CC28">
"You are deceiving your parents, Ed|ward," returned Charles, "and you mu&s;t allow there is harm in that; but it does not &s;ignify arguing, if you are bent upon going, I cannot prevent you; but I a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hall, on no account whatever, think of going with you."</P>
<P>"Nay, now, my dear Charles," &s;aid Ed|ward, "I do not often a&s;k a favour of you&mdash;Do oblige me this once, I will never again, I promi&s;e, de&s;ire you to do a thing without my father's knowledge."</P>
<P>"This is always the way," returned Charles; "you know it hurts me to refu&s;e any reque&s;t you make, and you take advan|tage of my weakne&s;s. You have drawn me into many things again&s;t my inclination, but I am determined not to be prevailed upon in this: it is &s;uch a wicked thing to deceive your parents, and to draw the &s;ervants in to tell lies&mdash;I am &s;urpri&s;ed you can think of it."</P>
<P>"There will be no occa&s;ion," returned Edward," to tell any lies; we &s;hall be back long enough before either father or mother returns. Now, Charles, I have done many things to oblige you; do not deny me &s;uch a trifle: There will be no other review be|fore we go to &s;chool, and I have &s;et my heart upon &s;eeing one."</P>
<P>"Say no more, my dear Edward, you
<PB N="108" REF="030966_0111_0FEA0D4A371FCD18">
know it di&s;tre&s;&s;es me to di&s;oblige you; but indeed I cannot countenance you in &s;uch a bad action: Do, let me entreat you, think no more of this wicked &s;cheme."</P>
<P>"Look you, Charles," &s;aid Edward, "all you can &s;ay will be to no purpo&s;e: I am de|termined to &s;ee the review, whether you go or not; &s;o it will make no difference in that re&s;pect, only I &s;hall in future know how far I ought to rely on your friend&s;hip: As long as you can keep your neck out of the noo&s;e, you do not care what becomes of me."</P>
<P>This la&s;t ob&s;ervation piqued the pride, and wounded the friend&s;hip of our hero, who began to utter his refu&s;als with le&s;s confi|dence. Edward perceived it, and continu|ed to &s;olicit, till Charles, notwith&s;tanding all he had &s;aid, was weak enough to be over|come, and actually con&s;ented to accompany him.</P>
<P>George, the &s;table-boy, was prevailed up|on, with a bribe of half a crown, to attend them, and to keep the &s;ecret, and our two young gentlemen, the one on Lightfoot, and the other on the black poney, &s;et forward on their</P>

<P>Edward, who, no more than his friend, had, been much accu&s;tomed to ride on hor&s;eback, tho' extremely elated with his &s;tation, found
<PB N="109" REF="030966_0112_0FEA0D4C9ED23688">
&s;ome difficulty in keeping it; Lightfoot being a very &s;pirited hor&s;e, and not much accu&s;tomed to the tight rein; however, by the directions of George, he managed to keep his &s;eat, and arrived in high &s;pirits at Black|heath. But here a di&s;appointment a waited them; the review they under&s;tood was defer|red, owing to the indi&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of the Royal Family, who were to be pre&s;ent. Ed|ward was much di&s;concerted; as al&s;o was his companion, who, notwith&s;tanding the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations he felt from acting &s;o con|trary to his principles, would not have been di&s;plea&s;ed, as he had gone thus far, to behold an exhibition entirely new to him; but they were fain to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Edward, having comment|ed on their ill luck, "we will not come thus far for nothing: George, do you think you can find a hou&s;e were we may have &s;ome refre&s;hment?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir," replied George; "there is one ju&s;t acro&s;s the heath, beyond that clu&s;ter of trees, where any thing may be had, if you have money."</P>
<P>"Yes, yes," &s;aid Edward, "I will find money." Saying this, he gave Lightfoot a touch with the whip, and away they all went. "Well," &s;aid Edward, recovering his &s;pirits, which the di&s;appointment had &s;omewhat damped, "this is delightful! I
<PB N="110" REF="030966_0113_0FEA0D4EF769E9C0">
am glad we came; it is worth &s;omething to ride Lightfoot! Charles could not forbear thinking the plea&s;ure was purcha&s;ed very dearly, and was ju&s;t going to reply, when Edward exclaimed, upon &s;eeing two youths advance, "I do think here is Ma&s;ter Jones, the &s;on of my fathers tenants! How do you do, my dear William," &s;aid he, finding he was not mi&s;taken, "what can have brought you here?"</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter Jones enquired re&s;pectfully after Sir John and Lady Bentley, and replied, that he was at &s;chool at Lewi&s;ham.</P>
<P>"But it is holiday time," &s;aid Edward.</P>
<P>"My father," returned Ma&s;ter Jones, "lives &s;o far off, that I have holidays only once a year."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Edward, "I am delighted to have met you. We came to &s;ee the re|view, but finding it is put off, are going to take &s;ome refre&s;hment. You and this young gentleman &s;hall go with us&mdash;I in&s;i&s;t upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t."</P>
<P>"We are much obliged to you, Ma&s;ter Bent|ley," returned the young gentleman, "but we cannot &s;tay without our Ma&s;ter's know|ledge; we came out merely for a walk."</P>
<P>"My &s;ervant," &s;aid Edward, "&s;hall go, and tell where you are; and then, I dare &s;ay, he will not be angry."</P>
<P>The young gentlman readily, upon the&s;e conditions, con&s;ented, and George was di&s;|patched
<PB N="111" REF="030966_0114_0FEA0D512E762658">
to Lewi&s;ham, while our party, highly plea&s;ed with their rencounter, proceeded acro&s;s the heath. Edward, who now felt him&s;elf of great con&s;equence, a|lighted at the inn, and giving his hor&s;e to the care of the ho&s;tler, entered with an air of importance, ordered a fire to be lighted in the be&s;t room, and &s;omething to be dre&s;|&s;ed as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible for dinner. The&s;e orders were pre&s;ently executed, and the young gentlemen, mutually plea&s;ed with each other, &s;et down to a couple of fine fowls and cu&s;tards. The cloth being removed, Charles took an opportunity of reminding his friend, that it would be prudent to think of returning; but Edward declared, he was determined to make out the day, for he knew his father and mother would not re|turn till late in the evening, and as to the painter he might go to Guinea.</P>
<P>Charles was going to expo&s;tulate, but Ed|ward, turning to his new companions, "What &s;ay you, my boys," &s;aid he, "to a game at cards?"</P>
<P>All, but Charles, &s;eemed highly to approve the motion; but he, &s;en&s;ible of the impru|dence, once more drew his friend a&s;ide to expo&s;tulate; Indeed, Edward, &s;aid he, you had better not &s;et down to cards, you know, how time pa&s;&s;es, we had better go home: For my part, I have had no peace &s;ince I

have been out, and I am &s;ure, I &s;hall have none till I get home.</P>
<P>"You are a cowardly fellow," &s;aid Ed|ward, "I tell you, there is plenty of time, we &s;hall be home long enough before my fa|ther and mother."</P>
<P>Saying this he broke from Charles, and calling for cards, began to &s;ettle the preli|minaries of the game.</P>
<P>"For my part," &s;aid Charles, "I would prefer to &s;et by, and look on; you know, Edward, I am not very partial to cards, and you are going to play higher than I can af|ford."</P>
<P>"What a &s;tingy fellow you are, Charles," &s;aid Edward, "to be afraid of loo&s;ing your money."</P>
<P>"I am not &s;tingy," returned Charles, "but I &s;hould be &s;orry to loo&s;e more money than I could pay."</P>
<P>"O, never fear," replied Edward, "I will help you out; but I know you will win."</P>
<P>"I neither wi&s;h to win nor lo&s;e," &s;aid Charles; "but, unable to with&s;tand the half &s;mile of ridicule, which he ob&s;erved on the faces of his companions, he &s;at down with the re&s;t, though it was to &s;take part of the money he had appropriated to the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of poor Catherine.

<P>Ma&s;ter Jones and his friend, however, &s;ee|ing the evening come on apace, at length, took their leave; declaring they dared not &s;tay any longer, and Edward him&s;elf thought it nece&s;&s;ary to call for the bill: contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to his expectation, it amounted to more than his pocket could di&s;charge. In this dilem|ma, he applied to his friend Charles, who, with a pang not to be expre&s;&s;ed, but certain|ly not more &s;evere than his imprudence de|&s;erved, di&s;bur&s;ed the la&s;t remaining &s;even &s;hillings of the guinea and a half he had &s;o faithfully promi&s;ed, before night, to carry to poor Catherine!

Though in|excu&s;ably imprudent, he had not an unfeeling heart; the thought, therefore, of di&s;appoint|ing the poor creature, to whom he had giv|en hopes, and who looked up to him as her only re&s;ource, filled his mind with un&s;peak|able angui&s;h, and he continued his way, ab|&s;orbed in the mo&s;t gloomy reflections, till rou&s;ed by his companion, who &s;uddenly checked his hor&s;e, and exclaimed, "O heaven, Charles! what will become of me? I have lo&s;t my father's diamond ring!"</P>
<P>This was like a thunder bolt to Charles; he was willing to hope, he had not heard right; till his friend added, "fly George, fly, &s;ee if it be not left at the inn."</P>
<P>George needed not this command to be repeated, he &s;purred his hor&s;e, and was out of &s;ight in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>"Feel in your wai&s;tcoat pocket," &s;aid Charles, "perhaps it may luckily have fall|en from your finger there."</P>
<P>"No," returned Edward, "it is certain|ly lo&s;t, unle&s;s you have picked it up."</P>
<P>"I!" &s;aid Charles, "I never &s;aw it but up|on your hand at dinner, and I thought more than once to a&s;k, whether Sir John or my lady, had given it you."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Edward, "I &s;aw it ju&s;t be|fore we &s;et out lie upon my mother's dre&s;&s;|ing

table, and it unluckily came into my head that I would put it on."</P>
<P>"How could you be &s;o imprudent!" &s;aid Charles.</P>
<P>"Indeed," returned Edward, "I cannot tell what po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me, nothing could ever be &s;o unlucky, I never in my life before thought of &s;uch a thing&mdash;Dear, what a time George &s;tays! one might have been twice there and back before now&mdash;let us go and meet him&mdash;O here he is."</P>
<P>By this time George was come up, and his &s;orrowful countenance bore &s;ufficient te|&s;timony to the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his emba&s;&s;y: the ring was not to be found.</P>
<P>The reader may ea&s;ily form an idea of the di&s;tre&s;s of the whole party upon this con|firmation of their misfortune: Edward, who, on every occa&s;ion, was accu&s;tomed to follow the bent of his pa&s;&s;ions, was quite frantic, and declared that he dared not &s;ee his father without the ring, which he knew he particu|larly valued, on account of its once belong|ing to his grand-mother. Charles' feelings were not le&s;s acute, though unwilling to add to the di&s;tre&s;s of his friend, he confined them within his own brea&s;t: George, too, was not the lea&s;t affected upon this occa&s;ion; &s;en&s;i|ble that the blame would fall heavy upon him for taking the hor&s;es out without Sir John's orders, he was equally alarmed at an event

that threatened a di&s;covery, and ventured to reprove his young ma&s;ter: "La! &s;ir," &s;aid he, "how could you think of taking my ma&s;ter's ring! what &s;hall we do&mdash;I am &s;ure I &s;hall lo&s;e my place; and that will be very hard for my good nature&mdash;if it had not been for the ring,"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well," interrupted the young gentleman impatiently, "talking is of no u&s;e now; the ring is lo&s;t, and there is an end of it."</P>
<P>A &s;ilence of &s;ome minutes now en&s;ued, and our travellers, with a &s;low pace pro|ceeded homeward; each reflecting with bitterne&s;s on the &s;hare he had in the adven|ture. As for Charles, this unexpected mis|fortune had entirely bani&s;hed all thoughts of poor Catherine, and the re&s;entment of his patron was the only object that now pre|&s;ented it&s;elf to his mind. Edward, in the mean while, who had been revolving all the circum&s;tances in his mind, at length broke &s;ilence: "I tell you what, Charles," &s;aid he, "the be&s;t way to get out of the &s;crape, will be to deny that we know any thing of the ring."</P>
<P>"To deny it!" &s;aid Charles, with a&s;toni&s;hment; "to deny it! can you think of &s;uch a thing?"</P>
<P>"Why," returned Edward, "I am &s;ure, if my father knows the ring is lo&s;t, I &s;hall never hear the la&s;t of it."</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="030966_0120_0FEA0D62C2B74448">
"But what can be &s;o bad," &s;aid Charles, "as the &s;tanding in &s;uch a fal&s;ehood? you &s;aid, when you prevailed on me to come with you on this imprudent excur&s;ion, that, were it a matter of con&s;equence, you would be more &s;crupulous in deceiving your father."</P>
<P>"Well, well," interrupted Edward, impatiently, "to be &s;ure I did &s;o; but I did not then think I &s;hould ever have been in &s;uch a &s;crape; de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es re|quire de&s;perate remedies&mdash;and, my father's knowing who lo&s;t the ring, will not bring it back."</P>
<P>"Very true, ma&s;ter Edward," &s;aid George, "and if he knows about the ring, all mu&s;t come out, and I &s;hall lo&s;e my place, which will be very hard for my good-nature; for you know, Ma&s;ter Edward, I did it all purely to oblige you."</P>
<P>"You are very wrong George," &s;aid Charles, "to encourage Ma&s;ter Edward, in any thing &s;o wicked; we have certainly all done wrong, but let us not attempt to excu&s;e one fault by committing a greater: The only thing we can do now, is to con|fe&s;s all, and, &s;ubmit to what puni&s;hment Sir John thinks fit to inflict. I a&s;&s;ure you, Edward, I will not a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch a fal&s;ehood."</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="030966_0121_0FEA0D6514D37778">
"Well," returned Edward, if it will give you plea&s;ure to make a breach between my father and I&mdash;if&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I am certain," interrupted Charles, "that you have a father too indulgent to be in any fear of that &s;ort; though he will, no doubt, be di&s;plea&s;ed, he will not be ir|reconcilable."</P>
<P>"I know my father," returned the young gentleman, "better than you do; he is very indulgent, when I do nothing to di&s;plea&s;e him, but if I do, he is very pa&s;|&s;ionate, and I know will puni&s;h me with the greate&s;t &s;everity; but I &s;ee it will give you plea&s;ure to make me mi&s;erable."</P>
<P>"Nay," &s;aid Charles, "you know I incur the &s;ame danger as you: the re&s;ent|ment of Sir John will fall equally upon me; but I a&s;&s;ure you, I would rather &s;uffer every thing than tell &s;uch an unpardonable fal&s;e|hood.</P>
<P>"As you are &s;o very con&s;cientious, Charles," &s;aid Edward, "there is one way that you may oblige me, and yet avoid tel|ling a lie: you know the ring was never off my finger, &s;o you may &s;afely &s;ay, when my father a&s;ks you, that you never <HI>touched</HI> it, that will not be a lie."</P>
<P>"My dear Edward," &s;aid Charles "an equivocation is the very fir&s;t &s;pecies of lying; becau&s;e, as my father has often
<PB N="119" REF="030966_0122_0FEA0D6840BCA4F8">
told me, it is covering fal&s;ehood with the mo&s;t plau&s;ible re&s;emblance of truth: how|ever, we may flatter our&s;elves, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that we do not incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of God by this &s;ort of play upon words; the lie is already formed in our heart, upon which he looketh, and equivocation is only a more &s;pecious method of impo&s;ing it upon others. It is true, according to the literal &s;en&s;e of the word, I might &s;afely tell Sir John, I did not <HI>touch</HI> the ring; but if by this, I mean to convey that I know nothing of it, I am equally a liar, as if the &s;ame idea were conveyed in different words."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Edward, impatiently, "it is not a time to preach now: I &s;ee you are determined not to oblige me&mdash;but I know the rea&s;on: you &s;aid no longer ago than ye&s;terday, that you had forgot all pa&s;t differences, but I &s;ee now that you are glad to retaliate, and would rather get into a &s;crape your&s;elf, than not be re|venged."</P>
<P>This was a turn Charles little expected; he indeed repeatedly &s;uffered from the tur|bulent and arbitrary temper of Edward; but &s;uch was the affection he entertained for him, that a kind look, a word of con|ce&s;&s;ion, was ever &s;ufficient to efface from his mind every trace of re&s;entment or di&s;|plea&s;ure; he was therefore, inexpre&s;&s;ibly

hurt that his friend &s;hould &s;u&s;pect that he was actuated by &s;o mean a motive, and en|deavoured to convince him that he acted from a di&s;intere&s;ted regard to truth, which he had been taught to venerate as the ba&s;is of every virtue. Edward, who was not without art, perceiving his &s;u&s;picions touch|ed him to the quick, pretended to be but the more confirmed in them, thinking it would be the mo&s;t effectual means to attain his ends.</P>
<P>"Yes, yes," &s;aid he, "I &s;ee you are glad to retaliate; I relied too much on your pro|fe&s;&s;ions: It is true, I may not be able to boa&s;t of a temper, at all times, &s;o equal as yours; but Charles could not &s;eriou&s;ly have a&s;ked a favour, that I could have refu&s;ed: my temper may be warm, perhaps violent, but I am equally warm in my attachments, I cannot be a cool friend."</P>
<P>"I am not a cool friend," replied Charles, with tears in his eyes, "I am &s;ure, Edward, you never found me &s;o: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y my friend&s;hip in any thing that will render you a real &s;ervice, and you &s;hall &s;ee with what readine&s;s I will prove it, at all hazards."</P>
<P>"O!" &s;aid Edward, with a &s;neer, "it is ea&s;y to be bold when danger is afar off: I a&s;k the proof now, and from henceforth &s;hall know the value I ought to &s;et on your friend&s;hip."</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="030966_0124_0FEA0D6D01B437E0">
"What would you have me do?" &s;aid Charles, who was weak enough to be moved by his friend's pretended &s;u&s;picions; "'tis true, it is not the fir&s;t time, I have been &s;o weak as to be prevailed upon by your entreaties, to enter into things that I knew were wrong; but this is of &s;uch &s;erious con&s;equence, indeed, I cannot; be&s;ide, when we have told this fal&s;ehood, do you &s;uppo&s;e your father will believe we know nothing of the ring?"</P>
<P>"O!" &s;aid Edward, "'tis a hundred to one if he mi&s;&s;es it; he does not wear it once in &s;even years: he will think it has been &s;wept away, or that he has lo&s;t it off his finger; for I heard him &s;ay, the la&s;t time he wore it, it was &s;o large he could &s;carcely keep it on; but, however, if your friend&s;hip will not &s;uffer you to make &s;o &s;mall a &s;acrifice&mdash;I can only &s;ay, it cannot be very &s;trong, and that I &s;hall, in future, know how to value it."</P>
<P>Charles really entertained the &s;incere&s;t friend&s;hip for the &s;on of his patron; this was piqued by the pretended &s;u&s;picions of the artful boy; who, ob&s;erving that he began to utter his refu&s;als with a le&s;s re&s;o|lute tone of voice, took advantage of his weakne&s;s, and by dints of entreaties and tears, though he did not convince his rea&s;on, worked &s;o far upon his affection, that, in

<P>The reader will judge, that the unea&s;i|ne&s;s of the whole party encrea&s;ed the nearer they drew toward home; the day had for &s;ome time clo&s;ed, and they were alarmed, le&s;t Sir John and his lady were returned: However, their fears on this head, were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, neither of them were at home, and Edward learnt, with great &s;atisfaction, that the portrait painter had &s;ent to put off his attendance till the next day: he exulted extremely upon the occa|&s;ion, and &s;o far recovered his &s;pirits, as to banter Charles a great deal upon his cowar|dice. "I told you," &s;aid he, "we &s;hould come off &s;afe; I dare &s;ay, my father will not be at home this hour." He was however deceived in his calculation; for Sir John and Lady Bentley arrived within a quarter of an hour: Charles, who was but young in the art of deceiving, &s;ickened at the thought of meeting Sir John; he, therefore, took the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;neaking to his chamber, where, with grief and vexation, he called to mind all the</P>

<HEAD>EVENTS OF THE DAY.</HEAD>
<P>From the excur&s;ion to Blackheath, he reflected on the lo&s;s of the ring, and not with le&s;s bitterne&s;s on the lo&s;s of his money: The &s;ituation of poor Catherine returned fre&s;h to his remembrance: "I am the only friend," &s;aid he, "to whom &s;he can look in her di&s;tre&s;s: I have pledged my&s;elf to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, &s;he is, without doubt, now li&s;te|ning anxiou&s;ly to every foot, in hopes 'tis mine. What a di&s;appointment, when &s;he finds I do not come! What a wretch I mu&s;t appear! Who knows, perhaps &s;he may think I meant to make a je&s;t of her misfor|tunes. I have heard of &s;uch things; and all this is through my own folly; what oc|ca&s;ion had I to play at cards with money that was not my own? for it certainly was not, when I had promi&s;ed it to another per&s;on. What can I do? if I could but borrow the money! but it is vain to think of that, for I know Edward has not a &s;ix|pence left. What can I do?&mdash;If I could but think of a way to rai&s;e it! if I had but any thing I could &s;ell for the money&mdash;my watch&mdash;but that will be mi&s;&s;ed directly; and be&s;ides, where can I &s;ell it&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e it is not cu&s;tomary for &s;hop-keepers to pur|cha&s;e &s;uch things&mdash;and yet poor Catherine,
<PB N="124" REF="030966_0127_0FEA0D74B1FD4978">
one would almo&s;t hazard every thing to keep one's word.&mdash;It is &s;o &s;hameful, &s;o in|human, to give her hopes, and then di&s;ap|point them. But what will Sir John &s;ay, when he &s;ees me without the watch he &s;o generou&s;ly gave me? What can I &s;ay? he will certainly mi&s;s it&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e I have &s;ent it to be mended&mdash;but that will be a fal&s;e|hood&mdash;I am already involved in one&mdash;I am grown very wicked! what would my father &s;ay! And yet poor Catherine! The watch, I am &s;ure, co&s;t four guineas&mdash;if I could &s;ell it for two, I could keep my word, and at lea&s;t ea&s;e my mind of one burthen&mdash;I am almo&s;t tempted; the holidays are now nearly half elap&s;ed: Sir John may not mi&s;s the watch&mdash;and then, I will &s;ave every farthing I get for pocket money, to replace it before the next&mdash;I will get up early to|morrow morning, and go into the fir&s;t watch-makers I come to; if I can &s;ell it, I will&mdash;I mu&s;t not think of the con&s;equen|ces&mdash;I am very mi&s;erable, one would hardly think how many faults one fal&s;e &s;tep leads one to commit! There is Sir John's ring&mdash;but I will think no more, I have promi&s;ed Edward, and I mu&s;t keep my word." Saying this, Charles undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and went to bed, but the anxiety of his mind kept him long awake, the night was far &s;pent before he fell a&s;leep. Morning re|newed
<PB N="125" REF="030966_0128_0FEA0D76B02F53C0">
his cares, and he began afre&s;h to re|volve the project of the watch&mdash;&s;ometimes he thought of going to Catherine and acknowledging the truth, but this mea&s;ure his pride forbad&mdash;then he thought of writing, but that was as irk&s;ome&mdash;in &s;hort, reflection only involved him in fre&s;h per|plexity; the watch was at la&s;t doomed, and Charles repaired with it to a &s;hop; where, with a confu&s;ion that did not e&s;cape ob&s;er|vation, he offered to &s;ell it. The watch|maker, having looked attentively on Char|les, and then on the watch, a&s;ked what he demanded." Charles replied, "that he thought it worth three guineas; but was very glad to take two and half, which the &s;hop-keeper offered. With this, he ha&s;tened to Catherine; and putting a guinea and a half into her hand, "There, Catherine," &s;aid he, "is the money; I am &s;orry I di&s;appointed you la&s;t night, but I could not help it."</P>
<P>Poor Catherine's eyes &s;parkled with joy; &s;he called him her pre&s;erver&mdash;her good angel, and could not find words to expre&s;s her gratitude.</P>
<P>"I hope," &s;aid Charles, "that it will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e you wi&s;h, and that it may plea&s;e God to re&s;tore you." Then, di&s;engaging him&s;elf as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, he proceeded homeward. The happine&s;s he
<PB N="126" REF="030966_0129_0FEA0D7A12CA0348">
had communicated to poor Catherine con|veyed &s;uch joy to his heart, that for a time he &s;eemed to forget the means he had taken to procure it, as al&s;o the di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s in which he was involved with Edward. He &s;auntered on, enjoying the coolne&s;s of the morning, till, in pa&s;&s;ing a &s;hop-window, his eye was in&s;en&s;ibly, at|tracted by the prettie&s;t etui he had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>"What a Charming pre&s;ent," &s;aid Char|les, "that would be for my mother! if I had but money to purcha&s;e it: but there is the vexation," continued he, with a &s;igh, "without money, one cannot come at any thing." Then Charles began to think of the guinea that remained of the &s;um he had gained for the watch: This he had firmly re&s;olved to hoard carefully, and to add to it every penny he could get, till he had accu|mulated &s;ufficient to replace Sir John's pre|&s;ent; neverthele&s;s he was tempted to go in and a&s;k the price of the etui. It was eight &s;hillings: Charles thought it too much; but when the &s;hopkeeper a&s;&s;ured him it was a very great bargain, and &s;hewed him others of higher price, which in his opinion, were not half &s;o pretty, his re&s;olution was &s;haken; he began to reflect that it would not be &s;o very difficult to rai&s;e the value of the watch he wi&s;hed to replace, even though he &s;hould
<PB N="127" REF="030966_0130_0FEA0D7CA4CBD490">
purcha&s;e the etui: "In a few days," &s;aid he, "I &s;hall vi&s;it my god-mother, who never fails to make me a pre&s;ent; and Sir John, I am certain, will not &s;uffer me to leave town without marks of his genero|&s;ity; then there will be my weekly allow|ance, I can &s;ave that." In &s;hort, he pur|cha&s;ed the etui: and, while the &s;hopkeeper was counting out the change, his eye was unfortunately caught by a pretty little net|ting-ca&s;e. His &s;i&s;ter Mary, who was a great netter, immediately was pre&s;ent to his mind; it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t&mdash;the net|ting-ca&s;e was purcha&s;ed; but Charles would not have left the &s;hop quite pennyle&s;s, had not a &s;mall pocket-ca&s;e of in&s;truments for drawing attracted his notice. This could not be re&s;i&s;ted; it was &s;o &s;mall&mdash;&s;o neat&mdash;&s;o compact&mdash;the very thing he wanted. The watch was for the moment forgotten, and the ca&s;e of In&s;truments added to the etui and netting-ca&s;e.</P>
<P>"Though Sir John Bentley po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one of the mo&s;t humane and benevolent hearts in the world, his manners were au&s;tere and re&s;erved. It &s;o happened, that on this mor|ning, upon the appearance of Charles at the breakfe&s;t-table, he addre&s;&s;ed him with a greater &s;hare of complacency than u&s;ual: &s;uch is the effect of guilt, that Charles could not &s;ummon re&s;olution to look his bene|factor
<PB N="128" REF="030966_0131_0FEA0D7F1B7AD9E0">
in the face: Every kind word Sir John addre&s;&s;ed to him, &s;eemed a reproach to his di&s;&s;imulation; every time he met his eye, it &s;eemed to penetrate into his inmo&s;t thoughts. As for Edward, who was more hardened in vice, his feelings were le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible: he exulted mightily in the thought of having &s;o cleverly tricked his father: the ring indeed &s;ometimes gave him unea&s;ine&s;s, but then it was for fear the truth, by &s;ome unlucky accident, &s;hould be di&s;covered; as long as it remained concealed, he was happy; if it were po&s;&s;ible for guilt to be &s;o.</P>
<P>"Things remained in this &s;tate three days, during which time Charles heartily repented his imprudence, but fooli&s;hly thought that he had gone too far to retract: his con&s;cience continually upbraided him with his conduct, and he was in hourly fear of being interrogated concerning the ring or the watch, which la&s;t he re&s;olved to &s;ay he had &s;ent to the watchmakers to be &s;et to rights. The dreadful moment, however, at length arrived; Charles was &s;ent for into the &s;tudy of Sir John, which he entered with a beating heart, though with more confidence than u&s;ual. Let the reader judge how every fear was awakened, when he perceived there the very man to whom he had &s;old the watch, and the iden|tical

watch in the hand of Sir John! The per&s;on to whom Charles had &s;old the watch was the very &s;ame of whom Sir John had purcha&s;ed it. The watchmaker knew the watch, and ob&s;erving the confu&s;ion of Charles, whom he had frequently ob&s;erved pa&s;s his &s;hop, in company with Ma&s;ter Bentley, when he offered it to &s;ale, &s;u&s;pect|ed &s;omething more was in the matter than Sir John knew: unwilling however, to proceed on uncertain grounds, he re&s;olved to pay the price, and keep the watch till he had an audience with Sir John, who, the reader will conclude, was much &s;urpri&s;ed at the unfolding</P>

<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion that naturally aro&s;e from the &s;ubject, when the culprit appeared before him, was the cau&s;e of a proceeding &s;o extraordinary? Charles could make no reply, but &s;hame and confu&s;ion were &s;trongly pictured in his countenance. Sir John repeated the que&s;tion, but Charles was &s;till &s;ilent; the fear of bringing Cathe|rine into trouble for having received &s;uch a &s;um, without the knowledge of his pa|rents or patron, made him prefer any &s;ubter|fuge to that noble candour, which alone could have excu&s;ed his errors.

longer able to oppo&s;e &s;ilence to the repeated interrogations of Sir John, he replied, "That he met a poor woman in the &s;treet, and that he a&s;&s;i&s;ted her with part of the money." "But," replied Sir John, "three days ago you had, to my knowledge, a guinea and a half in your pur&s;e; you could therefore have followed the dictates of humanity without making &s;uch a &s;acrifice: What did you do with that money?" This was a que|&s;tion Charles did not expect, and was un|prepared to an&s;wer, without divulging the expedition to Blackheath. He he&s;itated&mdash;he did not know what to &s;ay&mdash;and at la&s;t produced the etui, the ca&s;e of in&s;truments, and the netting-box.</P>

opinion of his patron. Nor was this all; the &s;tory of the watch was circulated through|out the whole hou&s;e and indeed the whole neighbourhood: every one cen&s;ured him; every one exclaimed again&s;t his ingratitude, in &s;etting &s;o little value upon a watch the gift of his benefactor; and &s;u&s;pected, as he had di&s;covered &s;uch a want of principle in one in&s;tance, that other faults of the &s;ame nature remained behind, yet undi&s;covered. Charles now &s;incerely repented his folly, but was &s;till weak enough to believe he had gone too far to retract. All he had cou|rage to do was, repeatedly, to &s;olicit Ed|ward to acknowledge the expedition to Blackheath, and its con&s;equences re&s;pecting the ring; but Edward, encouraged by its remaining &s;o long concealed, was deaf to his entreaties; and to confe&s;s the truth, Charles him&s;elf was &s;o much intimidated by the di&s;|grace he had already &s;uffered, that he had not courage to pre&s;s his friend home to a confe&s;&s;ion, which he was &s;en&s;ible mu&s;t in|volve him in further. A fortnight elap&s;ed before the dreadful time of enquiry arrived; but the ring was then mi&s;&s;ed, the &s;ervants interrogated, and every corner of the hou&s;e &s;earched.</P>
<P>"The que&s;tion of enquiry was then put to our two young gentlemen: Edward, I am &s;hocked to relate, declared with a firm

voice and unblu&s;hing cheek, that he had not &s;een the ring, nor knew even the place where it was kept. Charles did the &s;ame; but that agitation, which will ever be the attendant on guilt, where the heart is not wholly corrupt, joined to the ill opinion entertained of him on account of his late di&s;|grace, con&s;pired to fix the &s;u&s;picions on him. Sir John, judging from the affair of the watch, was per&s;uaded he had either lo&s;t or &s;old the ring; and having in vain endeavoured to draw from him the truth, confined him to his chamber, with orders that he &s;hould have no other food than bread and water, till he confe&s;&s;ed. Edward's fears were, up|on this occa&s;ion, &s;eriou&s;ly awakened: he doubted not but Charles would now be brought to di&s;cover the whole, and repent|ed having &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly denied the truth, which he was &s;en&s;ible would incen&s;e his fa|ther more than the fault it&s;elf: he re&s;olved, therefore, to exert the influence he well knew he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over his friend, to prevent the con&s;equences he &s;o much dreaded. With this view, he went with him; and having condoled with him on his di&s;grace, a&s;&s;ured him, if he could have thought his father would have laid the blame on him, he would have confe&s;&s;ed the truth at fir&s;t; but he add|ed, that now he had &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly denied it, he could not recant without incen&s;ing his fa|ther
<PB N="133" REF="030966_0136_0FEA0D8AB94627B8">
to the la&s;t degree. By the&s;e artful a|pologies, he &s;o far won upon Charles, that he was weak enough to per&s;i&s;t in the fal&s;ehood, the di&s;covery of which, Edward artfully hinted, would not only ruin him, and more deeply involved him&s;elf, but al&s;o ruin poor George, who had acted entirely from his per&s;ua&s;ions.</P>
<P>"In the mean while, Sir John having adverti&s;ed the ring in the public papers, without &s;ucce&s;s, fully convinced that Charles was no &s;tranger to its fate, re&s;olved, &s;ince neither the puni&s;hment he had inflicted, nor the entreaties he u&s;ed, would induce him to di&s;cover the truth, to try what effect the di&s;|grace of being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his family would produce; a mea&s;ure which he adopted the more readily, as the conduct of Charles, in this in&s;tance and in that of the watch, made him appear by no means a proper compa|nion for his &s;on.</P>
<P>"Words cannot de&s;cribe the feelings of Charles upon this occa&s;ion: the thought of being thus &s;hamefully di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the family of his patron, operated &s;o forcibly on his mind, that he re&s;olved, let the con&s;equence be what it would, to confe&s;s every thing.&mdash;He was making his way with this de&s;ign to Sir John's &s;tudy, when, in cro&s;&s;ing the hall, he unfortunately encountered Edward, who &s;topped to enquire whither he was going in

&s;uch ha&s;te? Charles, with a &s;orrowful countenance, owned, that, unable longer to &s;upport the di&s;plea&s;ure of Sir John, he was actually going to confe&s;s the truth.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>Edward, much alarmed at this intelli|gence, by his tears and entreaties, once more &s;hook the re&s;olution of his friend.

Charles was, as u&s;ual, &s;oft|ened&mdash;he wept&mdash;he expo&s;tulated&mdash;but in the end yielded; and, with an aching heart, &s;et out a few hours after in the &s;tage coach for the peaceful man&s;ion of his father, at which he arrived toward evening the en&s;u|ing day.</P>
<P>How delicious would have been the em|braces of his honoured parents&mdash;his beloved &s;i&s;ters&mdash;had Charles been con&s;cious of de|&s;erving them! but guilt can poi&s;on the pure&s;t plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Weldon, alarmed at the &s;ettled gloom that appeared on the counte|nance of their &s;on, enquired earne&s;tly after the health and welfare of the family he had left, and were much relieved when a&s;&s;ured they were well: but when Charles, bur&s;ting into tears, delivered a letter, with which he was charged by Sir John, a thou&s;and a|larming conjectures were in an in&s;tant form|ed.

Among them, the mi&s;conduct of their beloved Charles never once occurred. Let the reader then judge what they felt, when informed it had been &s;uch, that, for the &s;ake of his &s;on's <HI>morals,</HI> Sir John could no longer think of continuing Charles at the &s;ame &s;chool; though, to &s;often the &s;troke, he added, he would defray the expence of his education, at any other his father &s;hould chu&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Weldon read this letter, with an e|motion better felt than de&s;cribed. Had Charles lo&s;t the countenance of his patron upon any other occa&s;ion, he could have borne it with fortitude; but this baffled all his phi|lo&s;ophy: he threw him&s;elf into a chair, pale and trembling, and bending an eye of en|quiry on his &s;on, &s;eemed to demand the ex|planation he wi&s;hed, yet dreaded to hear.</P>
<P>Charles, when he left London, had by the advice of Edward, formed the re&s;oluti|on of keeping the truth concealed from his family; but though he had with&s;tood the reproaches of his con&s;cience, and the di&s;|grace of being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the family of his patron, he could not the di&s;tre&s;s of his father: he threw him&s;elf in an agony at his feet, em|braced his knees, and as di&s;tinctly as the agi|tation of his mind would permit, gave a de|tail of the unfortunate expedition to Black|heath, with all its attendant con&s;equences.</P></Q>

"Charles ventured not to reply; he fol|lowed his father in &s;ilence to the &s;tudy, where, being furni&s;hed with pen and ink, he &s;at down, and with a trembling hand, wrote a circum&s;tantial account of the train of e|vents, that had brought on his pre&s;ent di&s;|grace; generou&s;ly taking every opportunity in the cour&s;e of the narrative to palliate (tho' frequently at his own expence,) the faults of his friend. This letter was immediately di&s;patched to Sir John, and Charles, though in other re&s;pects, ea&s;ed of a burden that had long oppre&s;&s;ed his heart, was for a week, on Edward's account, a prey to very pain|ful &s;en&s;ations; at length, one day, as he &s;tood at a window that looked into the road, he &s;aw a coach, which he knew to be that of his benefactor, draw up to the gate. Sir John alighted, followed by his &s;on, and was received by Mr. Weldon and his Lady, with every mark of re&s;pect and friend&s;hip, though the recollection of their &s;on's di&s;grace, gave a check to that cheerfulne&s;s, which his pre&s;ence u&s;ual|ly in&s;pired."</P>
<P>Charles, alone, wanted courage to ad|vance, till Sir John, compa&s;&s;ionating his em|barra&s;&s;ment and confu&s;ion, encouraged him by a &s;mile of invitation.</P>
<P>"Ah, Sir," &s;aid he, "with diffidence, ap|proaching, my faults are too great to be for|given:

<P>"As I am willing," &s;aid Sir John, "to believe your repentance &s;incere, and although late, you have made for your errors, all the atonement in your power, by an avowal of the truth, I will not add to tho&s;e &s;tings, guilt will ever bring along with it, by re|proaches: I will do more, I will endeavour to forget the pa&s;t, &s;o &s;aying, he held out his hand to him, in token of reconciliation."</P>
<P>"Ah, Sir," &s;aid Charles, "I am unwor|thy this goodne&s;s: I am entirely unworthy of it: it wounds me more than the &s;evere&s;t reproaches. Then turning to his friend, Edward, &s;aid he, we have both done wrong&mdash;can you forgive me?"</P>
<P>"Dear Charles," &s;aid Edward, "embrac|ing him, I ought to a&s;k forgivne&s;s of you, I have led you into many errors: had it not been for me."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Do not excu&s;e your&s;elf," interrupted Charles, "I only am to blame; had I, with a proper firmne&s;s, re&s;i&s;ted your &s;olicitations, reflection would have recalled you to your duty."</P>
<P>"You have been both to blame," &s;aid Sir John, "but I hope your pa&s;t errors will teach you the advantage, that truth will e|ver have over fal&s;ehood: had you &s;topped at the fir&s;t fault, how much di&s;grace would

As one of my prin|cipal motives for wi&s;hing to recover the ring, was, that I might be enabled to di&s;|cover, by whom it had been detained, I made &s;ome enquiries, which led the woman to in|form me, that having &s;hewn the ring to a man who kept a public hou&s;e upon Black|heath, he &s;aid, he doubted not, but it was the &s;ame, two young gentlemen who &s;pent the day at his hou&s;e, a few days before, had lo&s;t; and that he was per&s;uaded it would be adverti&s;ed."</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved," continued Sir John, "to pur&s;ue my enquiry further, I &s;et out for Blackheath, and by the de&s;cription, the publican, at my reque&s;t, gave of the lads, to whom he alluded, I was per&s;uaded, I had been impo&s;ed on by my &s;on. I reproached him on my return, with his duplicity, and
<PB N="141" REF="030966_0144_0FEA0D9F9E0B8F10">
drew from him a full confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt."</P>
<P>"You, my dear Weldon, who are your|&s;elf a father, can alone judge, what I felt, when my &s;u&s;picions were changed into cer|tainty."</P>
<P>"Edward beheld the angui&s;h of my mind; my &s;ufferings, I believe touched him; his tears flowed abundantly&mdash;I hope they were &s;incere&mdash;but can we tru&s;t him, who has once deceived us?"</P>
<P>"O Father," &s;aid Edward, bur&s;ting in|to tears, "my puni&s;hment is great; but is ju&s;t; while I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed your confidence, I a|bu&s;ed it&mdash;I e&s;teemed it lightly; now, only that I have forever lo&s;t, am I &s;en&s;ible of its true value."</P>
<P>"Your conduct, Edward," &s;aid Sir John, "has given to mine, and to your mother's heart, a wound, which time only, and your reformation can heal; in the hope of that, as much as po&s;&s;ible, will we obliterate th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> remembrance of the pa&s;t; but neither mu&s;t your&s;elf or Charles, expect to po&s;&s;e&s;s the con|fidence we formerly repo&s;ed in you, till a long cour&s;e of rectitude has proved the &s;in|cerity of your repentance."</P>
<P>"Charles and his friend, &s;ighed deeply; never were they before &s;o completely hum|bled; Charles e&s;pecially, who&s;e feelings were more acute than tho&s;e of Edward, when he
<PB N="142" REF="030966_0145_0FEA0DA15F354200">
reflected, how low his conduct had &s;unk him in his own and in the opinion of all around him, was inexpre&s;&s;ibly hurt, and in bitterne&s;s lamented his folly: "O my dear Edward," &s;aid he, gra&s;ping the hand of his friend, "let us, from henceforth, invariably adhere to truth; let us be cautious of deviating in the &s;malle&s;t degree from the path of duty, out of which, I am convinced, there is no happi|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Ah! Charles," replied Edward, "had I li&s;tened to your advice, we had both been happy."</P>
<P>Sir John concluded, from the contrition that appeared in the countenance and expre&s;&s;ions of his &s;on and Charles, that his di&s;cour&s;e had made the impre&s;&s;ion he wi&s;hed, entered upon other topics, and having chatted half an hour with Mr. and Mrs. Weldon, took his leave, telling Charles, at parting, to hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s, as Edward would &s;et off for &s;chool, in a few days. This hint, which &s;ignified to Charles, that he was to accompany his friend, joined to the thought, that a po&s;&s;ibility &s;till remain|ed, of regaining one day, however di&s;tant, the confidence he had lo&s;t, in&s;pired him with a joy, to which, &s;ince the moment of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, he had been a &s;tranger.

<P>This letter, communicated joy to every part of this worthy family, and to none more than to Charles, who, with plea&s;ure, &s;aw a parcel made up from the wardrobe of his mother and &s;i&s;ters, di&s;patched to her, with a little pur&s;e, to which, each of the young ladies contributed to their ut|mo&s;t.&mdash;</P>
<P>The day in which the young gentlemen were to depart for &s;chool, at length, arriv|ed; when Mr. Weldon addre&s;&s;ed his &s;on to this effect:&mdash;"My dear Charles, do not forget that your errors have originated from the in&s;tabiliy of your mind: had you po&s;&s;e&s;|ed that noble firmne&s;s, which, if not the ba|&s;is, is the &s;afe guard of every virtue, you would not, again&s;t your rea&s;on, and better judgment, have con&s;ented to accompany your friend, upon an expedition, which your heart di&s;approved: this expo&s;ed you to a temptation, which was the con&s;equence of another error; I mean, that of ri&s;quing, a|gain&s;t your principle and inclination, mo|ney, which being promi&s;ed to another, was no longer your own; to repair this error, another was committed; your watch, the gift of your benefactor, was &s;old, and to conceal this a lie followed."</P>

Fortu|nately you was your&s;elf, the victim of your weakne&s;s and duplicity: the mind of Sir John, already prepared by the my&s;tery that hung over the watch, readily entertained &s;u&s;picions to your di&s;advantage: he believed you no &s;tranger to the fate of his ring, and was per&s;uaded, if you had not taken it with an intent to wrong him, you had inadver|tently lo&s;t it, and were too ob&s;tinate to own your fault. Your faultering voice, and guil|ty countenance, confirmed the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, and you were ju&s;tly puni&s;hed, by a di&s;grace|ful di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the family.</P>
<P>"A gentle and complying temper, my dear Charles, is amiable, but unle&s;s accom|panied by di&s;cretion, will lead you, as you have proved by experience, into the mo&s;t dangerous errors: to yield, where we know it is our duty to re&s;i&s;t, is a weakne&s;s for which it is difficult to form an excu&s;e: fir&s;t, be a&s;&s;ured that your principles are ju&s;t, and then let it be your glory, to act in conform|ity to them&mdash;but, I &s;ee the coach at the door; adieu my dear boy; let my words

<P>Charles had &s;carcely time to a&s;&s;ure his fa|ther, he would trea&s;ure his admonitions, be|fore he was &s;ummoned to attend his friend Edward; he, therefore, in ha&s;te, affection|ately embraced his father&mdash;his mother&mdash;his &s;i&s;ters&mdash;and departed for &s;chool. There, by the rectitude of his conduct, he, in pro|ce&s;s of time, (for bad impre&s;&s;ions are not ea&s;ily effaced) obliterated, the remembrance of his former errors, regained the confidence of his patron, and became the pride of his parents, and the delight of all around him.</P>
<P>Edward, too, pur&s;uing the example of his friend, became eminent for his virtues, and found by experience that the highe&s;t happine&s;s is that of performing our duty.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall make no comment," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "on my &s;tory, as I am per&s;uaded if it has failed to amu&s;e, you have too much good &s;en&s;e not to profit by the moral it con|tains."</P>

returned to &s;chool, not to &s;uffer him&s;elf, as he had often, to be laughed or per&s;uaded out of what he knew to be right. Tea was then brought in, and the young people, after their evening walk, retired to re&s;t, perfectly &s;atis|fied with the amu&s;ements of the day.</P>
<P>The next morning Mrs. Mills, having &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s at a neighbouring farm, pro|po&s;ed a ride thither to her young friends, who every hour more charmed with the &s;ociety of their aunt, expre&s;&s;ed the plea&s;ure they felt in the thought of attending her. The car|riage was therefore ordered, and &s;oon after breakfa&s;t they &s;et out for the farm; the mi|&s;tre&s;s of it, who was the picture of neatne&s;s and good-humour, with a train of little ones, came out to meet them. Mrs. Mills, with her u&s;ual affability, enquired after the re&s;t of her family, and &s;aid, &s;he had brought her nephew and niece to &s;ee the farm.</P>
<P>Mrs. Goodman replied, &s;he &s;hould be hap|py to &s;hew the young lady and gentleman the little that was worth their notice; but added, that &s;he hoped Mrs. Mills would per|mit them fir&s;t to take &s;uch refre&s;hments as the hou&s;e afforded. Saying this, &s;he con|ducted her gue&s;ts into a neat parlour, and &s;et before them &s;ome home-baked bread, curds and cream, and cow&s;lip wine, a repa&s;t which was extremely agreeable to the young people who&s;e appetites were &s;harpen|de by the ride.</P>

Afterwards the good woman, at the re|que&s;t of Mrs. Mills, conducted them into an adjacent meadow, to view a brood of beau|tiful ducklings.

<P>"Providence," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, who em|braced every opportunity of informing the minds of her young friends, "has furni&s;hed birds, and e&s;pecially water-fowl, at the extre|mity of the body, with a little bag, contain|ing a kind of oil with which they anoint and dre&s;s their feathers, to render them im|penetrable to the wet. You mu&s;t certainly have ob&s;erved how frequently all kinds of birds draw the bill over their feathers: it is a very nece&s;&s;ary employment; for, with|out it, their flight would be ob&s;tructed by every &s;hower of rain, as the feathers, by im|bibing the water, would become heavy and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it for u&s;e. It is ob&s;erved, that poultry which live under a covert are provided with a le&s;s quantity of this oil than tho&s;e birds which inhabit the open air."</P>
<P>From hence Mrs. Goodman took them to her granary&mdash;her dairy, which was neatne&s;s it&s;elf&mdash;her hay ricks&mdash;nor did &s;he forget her pig-&s;ties, which were perfectly clean, and
<PB N="148" REF="030966_0151_0FEA0DB10379D4E0">
littered with &s;traw, wi&s;hing her gue&s;ts to ob|&s;erve a fine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ow, which lay ba&s;king in one of them, with a litter of pigs, &s;carcely a fortnight old.&mdash;She next conducted them to the poultry-yard, where, taking a ba&s;ket, &s;he &s;cattered &s;ome corn, and called the feather|ed tribe about her. At the well known &s;ound, they came trooping from all parts; but &s;carcely were arrived, when a candidate of a different kind put them to flight. This was no other than a tortoi&s;e-&s;hell cat, which made way for a fine white hen that followed her. The hen without ceremony, fell upon the grain, and pu&s;s, like a faithful guard, &s;tood by to keep off intruders, till &s;he had eaten her fill: after which, &s;he walked off in triumph with her charge, leaving the coa&s;t clear to the re&s;t of the poultry, which immediately &s;ucceeded. This &s;cene was not more new to the young people than to Mrs. Mills: that an animal &s;hould di&s;cover &s;uch affectionate &s;olicitude for a creature it was its nature to de&s;troy, &s;urpri&s;ed her, and her &s;urpri&s;e was not le&s;&s;ened by the account the farmer's wife gave of this</P>

I took a world of trouble, but it grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, till at la&s;t its poor eyes clo&s;ed, and I really thought it dying. I was &s;o vexed to think of the time I had &s;pent upon it to no purpo&s;e, that I threw it in a pet to the cat, who lay a&s;leep by the fire, in my hu&s;band's arm-chair.

Yes, madam, &s;he pur|red over it, and the little creature &s;eemed to revive by her warmth. I was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed that I could &s;carcely believe my eyes; and my hu&s;band was not le&s;s &s;o, when he came home from work, to &s;ee the cat nur&s;ing the chicken, with as much tenderne&s;s as if it had been her kitten. You may be &s;ure, Madam, we did not take it from her except to feed it, which was a part of the bu&s;ine&s;s pu&s;s could not perform.

<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "I am amazed, I could not have believed a cat capable of &s;uch tenderne&s;s; I always thought them malicious and revengeful, and at &s;chool have played them many a wicked prank."</P>
<P>"I have been told," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "that cats furni&s;h much cruel diver&s;ion to &s;chool-boys; but &s;urely not to my William! he cannot tyrannize over a poor animal, mere|ly becau&s;e it has no power to defend it&s;elf, and delight in tortures at which every heart, not callous to the feelings of humanity, mu&s;t recoil."</P>
<P>"I cannot deny," replied William, "that I have joined our boys in many wicked prank they played, e&s;pecially in hunting of cats; but indeed, aunt, I never reflected on what the poor animal mu&s;t have &s;uffered. I thought only of my own amu&s;ement; but, I a&s;&s;ure you, I will never again join in &s;uch cruel &s;ports."</P>
<P>"Remember, my dear boy," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "that God commands you to be merciful to all creatures, and that he hears the cry of the weake&s;t animal: then reflect
<PB N="151" REF="030966_0154_0FEA0DB8364032E8">
on the happine&s;s which re&s;ults from commu|nicating plea&s;ure, and I am &s;ure you will not &s;eek it in inflicting pain."</P>
<P>"But, aunt, I always thought cats very malicious and revengeful."</P>
<P>"Cats, William, like other animals, are &s;en&s;ible of good or bad treatment: if you u&s;e them well, they will carre&s;s you; if ill they will endeavour to retaliate."</P>
<P>"But they are certainly le&s;s faithful than dogs," replied William.</P>
<P>"Perhaps &s;o," &s;aid Mrs. Mils; "but there are many in&s;tances which prove them not deficient in point of attachment. I re|member, a few years pa&s;t, reading in a magazine of a cat, which di&s;covered &s;o &s;trong an attachment to a dog, that, &s;eeing him one day engaged with ano|ther, before her ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, &s;he flew into the &s;treet, and fell upon the antagoni&s;t of her favorite with &s;uch fury, that &s;he forced him, in the &s;ight of numerous &s;pectators, to quit the field."</P>
<P>"But is there not," &s;aid Clara, "in gene|ral, an antipathy between cats and dogs?"</P>
<P>"It appears &s;o," replied Mrs. Mills: "but when they are bred together, it &s;eems to &s;ub|&s;ide, and I have known many in&s;tances in which it has given place to cordial affecti|on, which makes me the more readily give credit to the anecdote I have ju&s;t related: but, without forcing nature from her general
<PB N="152" REF="030966_0155_0FEA0DBC25EC2140">
cour&s;e, repeated in&s;tances prove that cats are capable of very &s;trong attachments."</P>
<P>"Well, aunt," &s;aid William, "though you are &s;uch an advocate for cats, you mu&s;t allow, after all, they are of little u&s;e."</P>
<P>"I could tell you," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "of cats that were taught to hunt and de&s;troy &s;erpents; for &s;o it is recorded they did in the i&s;land of Cyprus; but the &s;ervices they render us in England are, in my opinion, &s;ufficient to exalt their fame, and entitle them to kind treatment."</P>
<P>"I do not," &s;aid William, "recollect any &s;ervice they can do us, except the killing of a few rats and mice."</P>
<P>"Do you not think that," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice?"</P>
<P>"Truly, aunt," returned William, "if cats can render us no greater &s;ervice, I do not think we have &s;o much rea&s;on to value them. What harm can &s;uch in&s;ignificant creatures as rats and mice do us? To be &s;ure, they make free with a little of our bacon and chee&s;e&mdash;but that is not worth the think|ing of."</P>
<P>"Very true, William," &s;aid Clara.</P>
<P>"The&s;e in&s;ignificant creatures," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "as William calls them, may be more formidable than either of you imagine: I once knew a gentleman who&s;e hou&s;e, in Scotland, was undermined, and the founda|ons &s;hakened by rats."</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="030966_0156_0FEA0DBE609D22E8">
"Indeed!"</P>
<P>"Yes; they came from a &s;hip that touch|ed at the port, and infe&s;ted his hou&s;e in &s;uch numbers, that the foundation of it actu|ally gave way: and the damage he &s;u&s;tained from them, in this and other in&s;tances, was e&s;timated at upwards of five hundred pounds."</P>
<P>"Was it po&s;&s;ible!" &s;aid Clara.</P>
<P>"There was &s;carcely a che&s;t or a drawer in his hou&s;e into which they did not pene|trate: The linen was gnawed in holes&mdash;and as to the provi&s;ions! &s;ugar&mdash;meat&mdash;bread&mdash;rice&mdash;corn&mdash;nothing e&s;caped the rava|ges of tho&s;e mercile&s;s &s;poilers."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "could one have thought it po&s;&s;ible for &s;o &s;mall an animal as a rat to do &s;uch mi&s;chief!"</P>
<P>"So it was," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "and you cannot but confe&s;s the utility of the cat, which pre&s;erves us from creatures which are capable of being &s;o formidable."</P>
<P>"I &s;ee," &s;aid William, "that Mrs. Pu&s;s is of more con&s;equence than I thought her."</P>
<P>"But, as I have acquainted you," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "with the plunders of the&s;e mi&s;chievous animals, I mu&s;t not forget the ingenuity with which &s;ome of them were executed: What do you think of their con|veying eggs, unbroken, from the top of the hou&s;e, which was three &s;tories high, to the bottom?"</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="030966_0157_0FEA0DC0149E1B50">
"Why, I think," &s;aid William, it was, ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould my&s;elf," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "have thought &s;o, had I not been told it was a fact by my friend and his lady, upon who&s;e ve|racity I can place the firme&s;t reliance."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "I think it could be effected by nothing le&s;s than a miracle: do tell us, aunt, how it was."</P>
<P>"I am my&s;elf," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "igno|rant how the bu&s;ine&s;s was performed; I can only tell you that, at the &s;ea&s;on of the year when eggs are plenty, my friend, as it is cu&s;tomary in the north, grea&s;ed a number and put them into a large &s;tone jar, to pre|&s;erve them &s;weet for u&s;e. A &s;hort time after, &s;he was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find the eggs, which were in the jars at the top of the hou&s;e, con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, though none had been u&s;ed in the family. It was thought impo&s;&s;ible this could be the work of the rats; but &s;o it proved: On a &s;trict examinati|on, the eggs, in part whole and part &s;hells, with the contents &s;ucked out, were found in burrows made by the rats, at the bottom of the hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"How could they po&s;&s;ibly carry them, without breaking?" &s;aid Clara.</P>
<P>"That is a my&s;tery&punc; my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "I cannot explain; I can only a&s;|&s;ure you, upon authority I cannot doubt, that the fact really happened."</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="030966_0158_0FEA0DC2695BF3A0">
"They mu&s;t have rolled them down the &s;tairs," &s;aid William.</P>
<P>"Nay," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "in that ca&s;e, they mu&s;t inevitably have broken."</P>
<P>"Oh," &s;aid William, "I have ju&s;t thought how they managed the bu&s;ine&s;s; I remember hearing my papa tell of a friend of his, who once watched and &s;aw one of the&s;e ingenious gentlemen hop down &s;tairs, upon his hind legs, with &s;ome corn which he had taken from the garret, in his fore paws; I dare &s;ay, the rats you have been telling us about conveyed the eggs down in the &s;ame manner."</P>
<P>"It is very likely they might, &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "but I think it equally probable that the bu&s;ine&s;s was effected by combination; that is to &s;ay, that more than one was con|cerned in it, though I cannot &s;ay whether performed exactly in the &s;ame manner AE&s;op repre&s;ents in his fable of the two rats and the egg. Since I have known the anecdote of my friend's eggs, it has more than once occurred to me that it is po&s;&s;ible the fable in AE&s;op might be founded upon a fact; I am per&s;uaded, that all animals have a lan|guage or &s;ign, by which they under&s;tand each other, as far as it is nece&s;&s;ary for their mutual benefit and pre&s;ervation; and that rats have a language, and act in concert is evident from a curious anecdote that I will relate to you:"</P>
<P>"A gentleman having a pre&s;ent of &s;ome

Florence oil, the fla&s;ks were &s;et in his cellar, in the bottom of a &s;hallow box: the oil not being wanted for u&s;e, they remained there &s;ome time; when the owner, going one day by chance into the cellar, was &s;urpri&s;ed to find the wicker work, by which the fla&s;ks were &s;topped, gnawed from the greater part, and, upon examination, the oil &s;unk about two, or two inches and a half from the neck of each-fla&s;k. It &s;oon occurred to him that it mu&s;t be the work of &s;ome kind of vermin; and being a man of a &s;pecula|tive turn, he re&s;olved to &s;atisfy the curio&s;ity rai&s;ed in his mind; he accordingly found means to watch, and actually detected three rats in the very act: but how do you think they managed to get at the oil? You know the neck of the fla&s;k was long and narrow; it required therefore &s;ome contrivance.</P>
<P>"Indeed it did," &s;aid William; "but I dare &s;ay the rats found out a better expe|dient for them&s;elves than I &s;hould for them."</P>
<P>"I told you three rats were engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s," re&s;umed Mrs. Mills: "one of the&s;e &s;tood upon the edge of the box, while another, mounting his back, dipped his tail in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> fla&s;k, and pre&s;ented it to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> places, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="157" REF="030966_0160_0FEA0DC78D9F1368">
was his turn to act the porter, and he took his &s;tation at the bottom. In this manner the three rats alternately relieved each oth|er, and banquetted upon the oil, till they had &s;unk it beyond the length of their tails."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Clara, "if they were e|qual to &s;uch a contrivance, they could beat no lo&s;s to convey the eggs to their burrows without breaking: one may believe them capable of any thing: but is the &s;tory really to be relied on?"</P>
<P>"I had it from the mouth of the gen|tleman who was him&s;elf witne&s;s of the fact he was a man of character and &s;peculation, upon who&s;e veracity I can rely."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "it is a mo&s;t ex|traordinary &s;tory, but nothing can &s;urpri&s;e me after pu&s;s and her chicken, that exceeds every thing I ever heard of."</P>
<P>"It was a &s;ingular circum&s;tance," &s;aid the Lady, "but I think Mrs. Goodman told us pu&s;s had ju&s;t lo&s;t a litter of kittens?"</P>
<P>"Yes, madam," &s;aid the farmer's wife, who had been li&s;tening with &s;ilent attention to the di&s;cour&s;e, "&s;he had kittened a few days before, and my hu&s;band had drowned the litter."</P>
<P>"This circum&s;tance, then," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "accounts in &s;ome mea&s;ure, for an attachment that appears otherwi&s;e, &s;o fo|reign to the nature of the animal; we can
<PB N="158" REF="030966_0161_0FEA0DCA34227368">
find no difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the in|&s;tinct, which nature had awakened in the cat, for the pre&s;ervation of her own young, deprived of its object, was ea&s;ily transferred to the chicken, upon which it acted with equal force."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "whatever might be the cau&s;e, it was a droll &s;ight, to &s;ee pu&s;s march up the yard, with her fea|thered attendant; I declare it was worth riding five miles to &s;ee her."</P>
<P>Mrs. Mills, now thinking it time to take leave of their obliging ho&s;te&s;s, wi&s;hed her a good day, and &s;tepped into the carriage, followed by her young friends, who return|ed extremely plea&s;ed with the farm, and its inhabitants, in who&s;e countenance Clara thought &s;he ob&s;erved more happine&s;s and content than &s;he had ever experienced in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e gaities &s;he had, three days ago, con&s;idered as the chief ble&s;&s;ings of life.</P>

<P>This la&s;t propo&s;al was preferred; for though Clara and William had every day pa&s;&s;ed through the gallery, to and from their chamber, they had not &s;topped to ob|&s;erve one of the pictures; the entertainment, therefore, was new to them; and Mrs. Mills, with her u&s;ual kindne&s;s, rendered it doubly agreeable, by pointing out to them the beauties of each picture, and the diffe|rent &s;ubject it repre&s;ented: "That engag|ing figure," &s;aid &s;he, pointing to a piece on her right hand, "repre&s;ents Mahommed Akbar, Emperor of Indo&s;tan; he is de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ed by the hi&s;torians of his country as po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of many virtues; but no part of his conduct &s;hines more amiable than that which re&s;pects his Mini&s;ter Byram, whom you &s;ee repre&s;ented in the &s;ame piece. By|ram, to whom Akbar's father, in a great mea&s;ure, owed his re&s;toration to the throne, from which he was bani&s;hed by the treach|ery of his brothers, was appointed Regent of the kingdom during the minority of Ak|bar, who, though only fourteen when he a&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ded the throne, gave an early In&s;tance of his wi&s;dom and confidence in this great man; for, finding his kingdom involved in dangerous wars, he called Byram <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o him,

and addre&s;&s;ing him by the title of Noble Baba, that is to &s;ay, father; he told him, "that he repo&s;ed his whole tru&s;t in his pru|dence and good conduct, and de&s;ired he would take whatever mea&s;ures he thought nece&s;&s;ary for the defence and &s;upport of his kingdom; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring him, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that he would give no attention to any malicious in&s;inua|tions that might by his enemies be &s;ugge&s;t|ed to his prejudice."</P>
<P>"This prudent conduct of the young Em|peror could not but engage the affections of Byram, by who&s;e exertion he was &s;oon &s;et|tled peaceably upon the throne, and his kingdom in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate: but, though Byram was an able &s;tate&s;man, and an expe|rienced warrior, his di&s;po&s;ition was &s;u&s;pici|ous and vindictive; he grew jealous of the favours be&s;towed by his ma&s;ter upon others, and began to &s;u&s;pect his affection e&s;tranged from him.

<P>"This &s;o offended Byram, that he fell from his allegiance, and a&s;&s;embled troops,

with an intent of conquering &s;ome part of his ma&s;ter's dominions, and founding an in|dependent kingdom.

<P>"It was, on this occa&s;ion, that the cha|racter of this young monarch &s;hone forth in its full lu&s;tre; he in&s;tantly di&s;patched one of his omrahs, to invite Byram to court; and that no mark of favour and di&s;tinction might be wanting, a con&s;iderable number of chiefs, were, by the orders of Akbar, &s;ent to meet him half way, and conduct him into his pre&s;ence. When Byram appeared before the Emperor, he hung his turban round his neck, in token of humiliation, and threw him&s;elf in tears at the foot of the throne. Akbar in&s;tantly rai&s;ed, and placed him in his former &s;tation, at the head of the omrahs; then, as a mark of peculiar honour, pre&s;enting him with a &s;plendid dre&s;s: "If the Lord Byram," &s;aid the gene|rous young King, "loves a military life, he &s;hall have the government of Calpe and Chinderi, in which he may exerci&s;e his mar|tial

<P>Byram replied, "The royal confidence and friend&s;hip for me mu&s;t now be dimin|i&s;hed; nay, lo&s;t: why then &s;hould I remain in the pre&s;ence? the clemency of the king is enough for me, and his forgivene&s;s of my late errors, a &s;ufficient reward for my for|mer &s;ervices. Let then the unfortunate Byram turn his face from this world to ano|ther, and pur&s;ue his pilgrimage to Mecca."</P>
<P>"The Emperor a&s;&s;ented to his reque&s;t, and ordered for him a proper retinue, with 50,000 rupees a-year, to &s;upport his dignity.

<P>'Undoubtedly,' &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "it did; we may he a&s;&s;ured that the kindne&s;s of his ma&s;ter wounded him, more than the &s;ever|e&s;t reproaches. The painter has in the piece before us de&s;cribed, in lively colours, the &s;hame, grief, and admiration, that By|ram mu&s;t have felt when introduced into the pre&s;ence of his ma&s;ter, and treated with &s;o much genero&s;ity: on the other hand, what generous pity and benignity beams in the countenance of the young Prince, as he rai&s;es the pro&s;trate mini&s;ter, to place him in his former dignity!&mdash;but as we are &s;peaking of the heroes of Indo&s;tan, ob&s;erve the pic|ture which is oppo&s;ite: the principal figure is Durgetti, queen of Gurat, celebrated for her beauty and accompli&s;hments."</P>
<P>"She is clothed in armour," ob&s;erved Clara, "and mounted on an elephant."</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "it was former|ly the cu&s;tom of many ea&s;tern nations to u&s;e elephants in war; but &s;ince mu&s;kets and

<P>"The extent of Durgetti's dominions were very &s;mall, not exceeding three hun|dred miles in length, and one in breadth&punc; but &s;o flouri&s;hing was this &s;mall tract, that it comprehended more than &s;eventy thou|&s;and towns and villages, well inhabited. A&s;aph, the governor of a neighbouring pro|vince, allured by the riches of this kingdom, marched again&s;t it; the queen, with a force equally powerful, prepared to oppo&s;e him. She led her troops to action, as you &s;ee the arti&s;t has repre&s;ented in the picture, clad in armour, and mounted on a ca&s;tle upon an elephant, with a bow and quiver lying at her &s;ide, and a lance in her hand. Her troops were in general unacquainted with war, but the noble example of their queen, and the love of their native independence, in&s;pired every brea&s;t with courage, and they repul&s;ed the enemy with &s;uch fury, that they left &s;ix hundred hor&s;emen dead on the field, and pur&s;ued the re&s;t, with great &s;laughter. Night coming on, the queen halted with her army, and gave orders to her troops that they might be ready to make an attack upon the enemy before they re|covered from their con&s;ternation: but her

mini&s;ters and chiefs oppo&s;ed this mea&s;ure, and in&s;i&s;ted upon returning to the field of battle, to bury their friends. The queen reluctantly con&s;ented; and after the bodies of the &s;lain, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, were burnt, again &s;olicited her chiefs to accompany her to &s;torm the Mo|gul camps. They, however, wanting her courage and prudence, vainly imagined the enemy would of their own accord evacuate the country, and refu&s;ed to &s;econd the dar|ing enterpri&s;e of their queen. Fatally were they deceived. A&s;aph attacked them the next morning with his heavy artillery, which he had the day before left behind on account of the badne&s;s of the roads. The queen advanced, upon the approach of A&s;aph, to a narrow pa&s;s, to oppo&s;e him; but he quickly opened him&s;elf a way into the plain beyond, where the army was drawn up in order for battle. Prince Biar, the queen's &s;on, a youth of great hopes, ex|hibited prodigies of valour; till being wounded, he became faint with the lo&s;s of blood, when his mother, who was mounted on an elephant, in the front of the battle, &s;eeing him ready to fall from his hor&s;e, call|ed to &s;ome of her people to bear him from the field. The lo&s;s of the prince, and of many who quitted the field with him, &s;truck &s;uch a panic into the re&s;t, that the unfortu|nate

She, however, no ways affected with her de&s;perate &s;ituation, &s;tood her ground, with her former fortitude, till &s;he received an arrow in the eye; in endeavouring to extricate it, part of the &s;teel broke &s;hort, and remained behind. In the mean time, another arrow pa&s;&s;ed through her neck, which &s;he al&s;o drew out; but nature &s;inking under the pain, &s;he faint|ed: recovering, however, by degrees, a brave officer of her hou&s;hold, who drove her elephant, &s;ingly repul&s;ed numbers of the enemy, wherever he turned the out|rageous animal. He begged permi&s;&s;ion, as the day was now irretrievable, to carry the queen from the field, a propo&s;al which &s;he rejected with di&s;dain."</P>
<P>"It is true," &s;aid &s;he, "we are overcome in war, but &s;hall we ever be vanqui&s;hed in honour? &s;hall we, for the &s;ake of lingering out an ignominious life, lo&s;e the reputation and virtue we have been &s;o &s;olicitous to ac|quire? no; let your gratitude repay the &s;ervice for which I rai&s;ed you, and which I now require at your hands: ha&s;te, let your dagger &s;ave me from the crime of put|ting a period to my own exi&s;tence."</P>
<P>"Adhar, which was the name of the officer, bur&s;t into tears, and begged, as the elephant was &s;wift of foot, that he

might be permitted to carry her from the field, to place of &s;afety. In the mean time, the queen finding the enemy crouded fa&s;t around her, &s;uddenly leaned forward, and &s;eizing Adhar's daggar, plunged it into her bo&s;om, and expired.</P>
<P>"The death of the queen rendered A&s;aph's victory complete. A few days after he be&s;eiged the fortre&s;s of Jora, where all the trea&s;ures of this noble family had been pre&s;erved for ten generations. The young prince, a little recovered from his wounds, bravely exerted him&s;elf, and lo&s;t his life in defence of his kingdom, and independence."</P>
<P>"What a pity it is aunt," &s;aid William, "that there is &s;uch a thing as war! how many it makes mi&s;erable."</P>
<P>"In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world," re|plied Mrs. Mills, "war is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;a|ry; but then it mu&s;t be undertaken in de|fence of our lives, property, or indepen|dence. We turn with di&s;gu&s;t and horror from the individual, who, hurried on by an in&s;atiable thir&s;t of wealth or power calmly &s;acrifices thou&s;ands of his &s;pecies in pur&s;uit of idols, which, when attained, can afford an imperfect, and at be&s;t, but a tran&s;ient, &s;atisfaction. We feel very differently inte|re&s;ted for A&s;aph, who&s;e &s;ole object was the riches of the kingdom of Gurat, and for the queen who &s;o nobly exerted her&s;elf to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="168" REF="030966_0171_0FEA0DE361CA3520">
the independance and property of the &s;ubjects."</P>
<P>"Certainly we do, aunt," &s;aid Clara; "but pray, do you think the queen of Gurat did right to kill her&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"Can you a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion?" replied Mrs. Mills; "it is an action which &s;ullies all her former glories: The ignorance of the age and country in which &s;he lived, where it was held more noble to die than to &s;uffer the ignominy of captivity, might palliate the crime, did it not appear from the words &s;he addre&s;&s;ed to her faithful offi|cer, 'Ha&s;te, let your dagger &s;ave me from the <HI>crime</HI> of putting an end to my exi&s;tence,' that &s;he did not err entirely through igno|rence. Let us, therefore, in paying a ju&s;t tri|bute of prai&s;e to her courage and magnani|mity, draw a veil over her errors." Saying this Mrs. Mills called the attention of her young friends to other pictures, and having entertained them with &s;everal plea&s;ing anec|dotes that occurred to her, upon review|ing each: "That," &s;aid &s;he, "is Alfred, one of our Briti&s;h kings, di&s;gui&s;ed as a har|per in the Dani&s;h camp."</P>
<P>Clara enquired the cau&s;e of his di&s;gui&s;e?</P>
<P>"The Danes," replied Mrs. Mills, "had u&s;urped his kingdom; he, therefore, u&s;ed this &s;tratagem to inform him&s;elf of their &s;ituations and de&s;igns".</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="030966_0172_0FEA0DE5B6343498">
"Pray, aunt," &s;aid William, "was it not Alfred who fir&s;t divided England into coun|ties?"</P>
<P>"It was," replied Mrs. Mills; "long wars had introduced &s;uch di&s;orders into the kingdom, that vagrants every where abound|ed, who, having no &s;ettled place of abode, after committing all &s;orts of outrages, by &s;hifting their quarters, ea&s;ily eluded ju&s;tice. To prevent this, Alfred divided the whole I&s;land into counties, the counties into hun|dreds and the hundreds into tythings. This done, every inhabitant was obliged to be|long to &s;ome tything, otherwi&s;e he was con|&s;idered as a vagabond, and the owner of the hou&s;e where he lodged, in ca&s;e of his e&s;cape, became re&s;pon&s;ible for any mi&s;de|meanour he might commit."</P>
<P>"It was a very wi&s;e regulation," &s;aid William; "Alfred was a great king!"</P>
<P>"He was not only a great king," replied Mrs. Mills, "but a good man: his charac|ter is the mo&s;t perfect handed down to us by hi&s;torians; e&s;pecially, if we con&s;ider the ob&s;cure age in which he lived: he protect|ed his country by arms, poli&s;hed it by arts, and enacted many u&s;eful laws for the happi|ne&s;s and future welfare of his people. He was the fifth king of the Saxon line.</P>
<P>"That picture," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, point|ing to one on her right hand, "is a view of

<P>"The next piece de&s;erves your particular attention, not only from the ma&s;terly &s;tyle in which it is executed, but from the u&s;eful le&s;&s;on it contains. I need not, I dare &s;ay, tell either of you, that the principal figure repre&s;ents Richard the Second, who, by his admirable pre&s;ence of mind pre&s;erved his own and the lives of his whole reti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">."</P>
<P>"I am quite unacquainted with the &s;to|ry," &s;aid Clara.</P>
<P>"Have you not read the hi&s;tory of Eng|land?" rejoined Mrs. Mills.</P>
<P>"O yes, madam."</P>
<P>"It is a&s;toni&s;hing then that you &s;hould not call to mind a circum&s;tance &s;o generally known, and in it&s;elf &s;o remarkable: The reign of Richard the Second was di&s;turbed by many civil commotions, and among others by an in&s;urrection of the common people, on account of the pole-tax, headed by a black&s;mith, known by the name of Wat Tyler. This rebellion became &s;o formida|ble, that it was thought advi&s;eable to offer terms, which being repeatedly rejected by the mutineers, the king propo&s;ed a confer|ence with their leader, which took place accordingly in Smithfield&punc; but, in this in|terview,
<PB N="171" REF="030966_0174_0FEA0DEB6BA78D68">
the in&s;olence of Tyler, who brand|i&s;hed his dagger with an air of authority, &s;o incen&s;ed Sir Thomas Walworth, mayor of London, that &s;u&s;pecting his de&s;ign was to &s;tab the king, he &s;tunned him with a blow of his mace, and another of the king's reti|nue run him thro' the body. The rebels, &s;eeing their leader fall, immediately prepa|red to revenge him, and bent their bows for this purpo&s;e; when the king, though at this time not &s;ixteen years of age, rode up to them, and in a re&s;olute tone of voice: 'What, my friends,' &s;aid he, 'will you then kill your king? be not concerned for the lo&s;s of that traitor; I my&s;elf will be your leader; Follow me, and I will grant you all your rea&s;onable de&s;ires.'</P>
<P>"The magnanimity of the young king &s;truck the multitude with &s;uch awe, that they changed their fir&s;t purpo&s;e, and, as if mechanically led, followed him into the fields, where they laid down their arms."</P>
<P>"What an a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tance of courage and pre&s;ence of mind!" &s;aid Clara, "How &s;urpri&s;ing, that it &s;hould not &s;trike me, when I read the hi&s;tory of England! but I &s;uppo&s;e I was thinking of &s;omething el&s;e."</P>
<P>"To be thinking of one thing and doing another," ob&s;erved her aunt, "is the cer|tain way to preclude improvement; and of all ignorance, none is &s;o di&s;graceful as
<PB N="172" REF="030966_0175_0FEA0DEE21434628">
that which relates to the hi&s;tory and geogra|phy of our own country."</P>
<P>"To &s;ay the truth, aunt, "replied Cla|ra, "I always thought hi&s;tory very dry and unintere&s;ting: When Mi&s;s Smith, therefore, who was for &s;ome time my governe&s;s, u&s;ed to oblige me to read it, I generally &s;at down with an ill-will, and paid very little atten|tion: but I certainly deprived my&s;elf of great <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> as well as improvement; for I am convinced, from the entertainment you have given us, madam, this afternoon, that, had I attended to what I read, I &s;hould neither have found hi&s;tory dry nor uninter|e&s;ting:&mdash;but pray, madam, what is the &s;ubject of the oppo&s;ite piece?"</P>
<P>"It is Regulus at the gates of Rome," replied Mrs. Mills: "you remember the &s;tory, William?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied William, "I have read it many times!"</P>
<P>"I am very ignorant," &s;aid Clara, with a &s;igh, "there has not been one, among all the &s;tories you, madam, have mentioned with which I am the lea&s;t acquainted."</P>
<P>"Since time once pa&s;t, my dear, cannot be recalled, let us," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "think only of improving the future: William, tell your &s;i&s;ter the &s;tory of Regulus."</P>
<P>"My &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid William, "would be more entertained to read it in Dr. Gold|&s;mith's

Romon Hi&s;tory: but I will relate it as well as I can:</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>You mu&s;t know, &s;i&s;ter, that Regulus was a great warrior: The Romans &s;ent him to fight again&s;t the Carthagenians; he over|came them in &s;everal battles, but was at la&s;t defeated and taken pri&s;oner. After a long time, the Carthagenians wi&s;hed to make peace with the Romans; &s;o they &s;ent Regu|lus with their amba&s;&s;adors to Rome, think|ing, as he had been a pri&s;oner four years, he would per&s;uade his countrymen to put an end to the war, that he might be &s;et free: but, before the Carthagenians let Regulus depart, they made him &s;olemnly promi&s;e, in ca&s;e the Romans did not agree to a peace, that he would return, and deliver him&s;elf up their pri&s;oner.</P></Q>
<P>"All the Romans were rejoiced when they heard that Regulus was returning to Rome: but he, with a &s;ettled melancholy, upon his arrival, refu&s;ed to enter the gates, &s;aying, that he was a &s;lave to the Cartha|genians, and unworthy the honours his country would be&s;tow on him. So he &s;tayed without the gates; and when the Senate a&s;&s;embled there (as was u&s;ual, to give audi|ence to the amba&s;&s;adors) he made propo&s;als for a peace, as the Carthagenians had di|rected him. The Senate were very much inclined to accept them, and it remained
<PB N="174" REF="030966_0177_0FEA0DF2EA756280">
only for Regulus, who had great influence with his countrymen, to give his opinion; which, to the &s;urpri&s;e of every one, he did for a continuance of the war. The Senate, though convinced by his arguments, could not re&s;olve upon a mea&s;ure that mu&s;t end in the ruin of a man who had acted &s;o nobly; but Regulus, fearing they might be bia&s;&s;ed by any per&s;onal concern for him, relieved their embarra&s;&s;ment, by breaking off the treaty, and ri&s;ing to return with the amba&s;|&s;adors to Carthage, which, in &s;pite of the entreaties of the Senate and his deare&s;t friends, he did, though he well knew the tortures he &s;hould undergo: but nothing would prevail upon him to break the pro|mi&s;e he had given to the Carthagenians, who, I am &s;orry to tell you, were &s;o enrag|ed, when they heard from their amba&s;&s;a|dors that Regulus, in&s;tead of ha&s;tening a peace, had given his voice for the conti|nuance of the war, that for three days they tortured him in the mo&s;t cruel man|ner, and at la&s;t left him to expire in a bar|rel &s;tuck with &s;pikes."</P>
<P>"What wretches they mu&s;t have been," &s;aid Clara, "to puni&s;h him for acting &s;o no|bly!"</P>
<P>"Their conduct," replied Mrs. Mills, "was indeed truly de&s;picable; but of what enormities will not rancour and revenge render human nature capable!"</P>

"Por&s;enna," &s;aid William, "behaved very differently toward Mutius, upon a &s;imilar occa&s;ion. How generou&s;ly he act|ed!"</P>

<P>"If you plea&s;e, &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid William, "I will repeat to you an abridgement our u&s;her made of this &s;tory; it was one of my ta&s;ks a few weeks before the holidays:</P>
<P>"When Tarquin the proud was expelled Rome, he engaged in his intere&s;t Por&s;enna, one of the kings of Eturia, who laid &s;iege to Rome, and reduced the inhabitants to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. Mutius, a youth of undaunted courage, re&s;olving to deliver his country from an enemy &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive, enter|ed the camp of Por&s;enna, in the habit of an Eturian pea&s;ant, re&s;olved to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king, or to peri&s;h in the attempt.

Three hundred youths like me have con&s;pired your de&s;truction.' Por&s;enna, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mind too noble not to acknow|ledge merit, though found in an enemy; &s;truck with the courage and magnanimity of the young man, he ordered him to be &s;afely conducted back to Rome, and offered the be&s;ieged terms of peace, which, being neither hard nor di&s;graceful, were readily accepted."</P>
<P>Clara thanked her brother for obliging her with the extract: and ob&s;erved, in her turn, that the conduct of Pro&s;enna formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to that of the Carthage|nians: "How noble," &s;aid &s;he, "to forgive the young man who had attempted to kill him!"</P>

<P>"Time, my dear Clara," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "&s;eems long only to tho&s;e who know not how to improve it."</P>
<P>They now left the gallery, and tea im|mediately followed.

to re&s;t, fully occupied with the thought of the plea&s;ure they were to enjoy the next day. But a di&s;appointment awaited them; a continued rain put a &s;top to the jaunt. Clara, who, though much improved by the conver&s;ation of her aunt, had not yet ac|quired philo&s;ophy to bear a di&s;appointment without murmuring, began to be a little out of humour: &s;he concealed it as much as po&s;|&s;ible from her aunt, who&s;e good opinion &s;he was very ambitious to attain, but could not forbear thinking they &s;hould pa&s;s a very dull day, and, during breakfa&s;t, was &s;o intent upon watching the clouds, that &s;he could &s;carcely attend to any thing that pa&s;&s;ed, till Mrs. Mills, having ob&s;erved how nece&s;&s;ary it was to accu&s;tom our&s;elves to bear di&s;ap|pointment, added, that though the weather for the pre&s;ent had put a &s;top to their in|tended expedition, &s;he doubted not, as her young pupils &s;eem plea&s;ed with the contem|plation of nature, that &s;he could &s;upply them with amu&s;ement equally agreeable.

Mrs. Mills, as u&s;ual, heightened their entertainment by a variety of curious parti|culars, which &s;he gave them of the little tribe that had once occupied the &s;hells. They were particularly attentive to the ac|count of the purple-fi&s;h, which &s;he told them had upon its back a little folded tunicle or bag, containing a white liquor, which dyed wool of a deep and unfading purple, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame u&s;ed by the an|cients for their purple dye; but &s;he added, that the quantity of this liquor in each fi&s;h was &s;o very &s;mall, that an immen&s;e number were nece&s;&s;ary to dye one piece of &s;tuff, which cau&s;ed the ancients to &s;et a very high value on their Tyrian dye, &s;o called, pro|bably, from its being fir&s;t di&s;covered or u&s;ed by the people of Tyre.</P>
<P>Clara and her brother were al&s;o much en|tertained with the account &s;he gave them of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ker, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mother of pearl, and with her de&s;cription of the manner in which the negroes dive, to furni&s;h us with the pearls contained in the body and beautiful &s;hell of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

This cabinet having for &s;ome time fur|ni&s;hed entertainment, Mrs. Mills unlocked ed the folding door of another, which &s;tood in a niche oppo&s;ite, and contained a mi|&s;cellaneous collection of natural curio&s;ities. Clara's eye &s;oon fixed on an American hum|ming bird, which, though dried, pre&s;erved a great &s;hare of its natural beauty. She took it from the cabinet with wonder, admi|red the lu&s;tre of its plumage, and above all its &s;ize, which did not greatly exceed that of a humble bee.</P>
<P>"Dear," &s;aid &s;he, "what a beautiful lit|tle creature! though &s;o &s;mall, the feathers, wings, talons, every part of it is as perfect as tho&s;e of the large&s;t birds: how I &s;hould like to &s;ee one alive?"</P>
<P>"In America," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "hum|ming birds of various &s;orts are con&s;tantly &s;een fluttering about the flowers, from whence they extract the honey that &s;up|ports them. The motion of their wings is &s;o rapid, that it produces a humming &s;ound, from which their name is derived."</P>
<P>"I thought," &s;aid William, "it was im|po&s;&s;ible they could feed upon &s;eed and ber|ries, as other birds do, the beak is &s;o &s;mall; it is not larger than a fine needle!"</P>
<P>"Small as it is," rejoined Mrs. Mills, "it renders them very formidable to larger birds, and e&s;pecially to one called the
<PB N="181" REF="030966_0184_0FEA0E064600B288">
goo&s;bee, which attempts to &s;urpri&s;e the young humming birds in the ne&s;t, but flies off on the appearance of the mother, who pur&s;ues the invader clo&s;e, and fa&s;tening her little talons under his wing, pierces him with her pointed beak, till &s;he has entirely di&s;abled him. Here is the ne&s;t of the hum|ming bird; have you examined it."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "this is indeed a ne&s;t in miniature! and, as I live! two little eggs, not bigger than a &s;mall pea!"</P>
<P>"How &s;mall," &s;aid Clara, "the pretty creatures mu&s;t be when they are fir&s;t hatch|ed!"</P>
<P>"They are &s;aid to be about the &s;ize of a large blue fly," replied Mrs. Mills.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, "it would be worth taking a voyage to America to &s;ee a humming bird.</P>
<P>"And pray," rejoined his aunt, "what do you think of a trip to the coa&s;t of Gui|nea, where deer are &s;aid to be found no big|ger than kittens!"</P>
<P>"Is that true?"</P>
<P>"Here is the leg of one," re&s;umed his aunt; "it is a common article in the cabi|nets of the curious: nay, I have &s;een them made into tobacco &s;toppers."</P>
<P>"Dear," &s;aid Clara, "how &s;mall! How I &s;hould like to have a Guinea deer and an American humming bird!"</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="030966_0185_0FEA0E089EF268B8">
"And &s;o &s;hould I," &s;aid William; "but pray, madam," continued he, "what is this? to judge from its appearance, it &s;hould &s;eem unworthy a place among &s;o many ra|rities.&mdash;It is &s;o dried and &s;hrivelled, it is im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what is the form or colour."</P>
<P>"It is," replied Mrs. Mills, "a leaf of the Papyrus, a large plant which grows wild in Egypt amid&s;t the &s;tagnate waters, after the inundations of the Nile. The Egypti|ans and Romans formerly u&s;ed a part of this plant for the purpo&s;es we do paper. The intermediate part of the &s;talk was cut and &s;eparated into different plates or laminae, which were laid together upon a &s;mooth board, &s;o as to form &s;heets. They were then moi&s;tened with water, which di&s;&s;olved a kind of glew that was in the pores, which &s;erved as a cement. The &s;heets thus form|ed were dried, pre&s;&s;ed, and kept for u&s;e. The Romans afterwards invented methods to bring it to further perfection. They beat it with hammers, to render it thin and le&s;s porous, poli&s;hed it with ivory, and, by a &s;ort of calendar, gave it a &s;hining glo&s;s.&mdash;It is from this plant that the paper of our day takes its name. The Egyptians, al&s;o, u&s;ed the roots for firing, and many other purpo|&s;es; built little boats of the plant it&s;elf, and formed the inner bark into &s;ails, mats, gar|ments, coverlids, and cordage; they al&s;o
<PB N="183" REF="030966_0186_0FEA0E0BCFC9D6F0">
chewed it, and &s;wallowed the juice as a great dainty. You &s;ee, therefore, William, that the intrin&s;ic worth of this plant gives it a ju&s;t title to ob&s;ervation."</P>
<P>"It certainly does, aunt," &s;aid William, "I &s;ee it is not right to tru&s;t always to ap|pearances; but what is this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ble&s;s me, 'tis a &s;tone tree!"</P>
<P>"It has that appearance," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "it is a petrifaction. Certain &s;prings abound with &s;parry particles, which being, by time, in&s;inuated into the pores of the &s;ub|&s;tance put into them, &s;uppo&s;e, for example, a vegetable, as in the in&s;tance before us, form a cru&s;t round it, which gives it, as you &s;ee, the appearance of &s;tone."</P>
<P>"I have heard," &s;aid, William, "of tho&s;e petrifying waters, but always under|&s;tood they actually changed the things that were put into them to &s;tone."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "that is a mi&s;|take, the vegetable undergoes no alteration; the &s;tony particles of the &s;pring, only, by adhering to it, in the manner I have told you, acquires the exact form, while the ve|getable it has enclo&s;ed decays."</P>
<P>"The&s;e petrifying waters," &s;aid Clara, "are, I &s;uppo&s;e, very dangerous to drink."</P>
<P>"I am not," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "&s;uffici|ently acquainted with their phy&s;ical proper|ty to tell you, whether or not they be
<PB N="184" REF="030966_0187_0FEA0E0F34160BA0">
whole&s;ome. But as no petrifaction can hap|pen in a vegetable, where there is a circu|lation of the juices, it follows, I apprehend, that no immediate bad effect, can occur from the drinking &s;uch waters, the blood being in con&s;tant circulation throughout our body."</P>
<P>"Here is another petrifaction," &s;aid Cla|ra, "taking up a little &s;tony branch, but it is different from the other."</P>
<P>"That," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, is coral, which is now a&s;certained to be a regular vegetati|on, though once thought by many learned men to be nothing more than a petrified &s;ub|&s;tance. It grows with the top downwards, in little caverns, or the jutting out of rocks, at the bottom of the &s;ea. On the branches are &s;mall tumours, containing a &s;ort of milk, and pinked in the form of &s;tars, from whence little flowers have been ob&s;erved to &s;hoot, but they withdraw upon being expo&s;ed any time to the air. This is the mandrepore, another &s;tony &s;ea plant.</P>
<P>"It is in the form, you &s;ee, of a little tree, the branches of which are &s;tudded with &s;everal holes; but there are different &s;orts of the mandrepore."</P>
<P>Mrs. Mills here cea&s;ed&mdash;and looking at her watch, ro&s;e and &s;hut the cabinet.</P>
<P>The young people thanked her for their entertainment, and were retiring, when
<PB N="185" REF="030966_0188_0FEA0E116A940258">
Clara &s;topped to examine a fine piece of embroidery that hung over the chimney.</P>
<P>"That piece," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "is the work of my God-daughter, Mi&s;s Elinor Reeves: I am indebted to her kindne&s;s and ingenuity for mo&s;t of the pieces that furni&s;h this room; if I am not mi&s;taken, you are no &s;trangers to each other."</P>
<P>Clara replied, "that &s;he had &s;everal times been in company with Mi&s;s Reeves."</P>
<P>"Then," rejoined Mrs. Mills, "I am &s;ure you will look with plea&s;ure upon the&s;e little e&s;&s;ays of her &s;kill; for I will venture to affirm, no one can know my dear Elinor without loving her. Her di&s;po&s;ition is truly amiable."</P>
<P>Clara made no reply; accu&s;tomed from her infancy to flattery, the prai&s;es of ano|ther were never welcome to her ear: wi&s;h|ing therefore, to change the conver&s;ation, &s;he turned to a land&s;cape that hung on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide of the room; and having enquired from what part of Europe the view was tak|en, ob&s;erved, that it was a very fine engrav|ing."</P>
<P>"An engraving!" &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "upon my word, you pay Elinor a great compliment; 'tis executed with the needle."</P>
<P>Clara was di&s;appointed&mdash;&s;he was vexed &s;he had taken notice of the piece, and was again &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="030966_0189_0FEA0E145DA700E0">
"I am not a judge of needle work," &s;aid William, "but I think that fruit (pointing to a piece of embroidery that hung near) is very natural. Do not you &s;i&s;ter?"</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Clara, "it is not ami&s;s; but, in the&s;e things, the prai&s;e is rather due to the per&s;on who de&s;igned, than the per&s;on who worked the piece. The effect does not altogether depend upon the needle."</P>
<P>"Very true," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "the nee|dle cannot make a bad de&s;ign, a perfect pic|ture, but it can add great beauty to a good one; and with re&s;pect to the&s;e before us, their chief beauty is derived from the nee|dle: ob&s;erve tho&s;e cherries and that peach; how admirably the colours are &s;oftened one into another&mdash;with what judgment the &s;hadows are thrown&mdash;one could almo&s;t fan|cy it po&s;&s;ible to take them from the ba&s;ket. This is reckoned one of Elinor's mo&s;t capi|tal performance, and you mu&s;t allow it excellent."</P>
<P>"O!" returned Clara, "I do not &s;ay, it has not merit, but your partiality, aunt, (ex|cu&s;e me) makes you blind to the imperfecti|ons.&mdash;Now I think, had more colour been thrown into the peach, the effect had been better&mdash;and are not the &s;talks of the cheries a trifle too long?"</P>
<P>Mrs. Mills beheld with concern the envy that gave ri&s;e to the&s;e ob&s;ervations. "Well,
<PB N="187" REF="030966_0190_0FEA0E17CF428E20">
my dear," &s;aid &s;he, "if you will not allow your friend merit, as an arti&s;t, you mu&s;t con|fe&s;s that her di&s;po&s;ition is truly amiable."</P>
<P>"Why," &s;aid Clara, "&s;he may be very amiable, but I own, I do not think her quite &s;o faultle&s;s as you &s;eem to de&s;cribe."&mdash;"But, Madam," (continued &s;he, wi&s;hing to put an end to a conver&s;ation from which &s;he ex|perienced &s;o little plea&s;ure,) "is it not time to dre&s;s for dinner?"</P>
<P>"I will detain you no longer, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, e&s;pecially as I have a little &s;earch to make for a manu&s;cript, which it has ju&s;t now occurred to me, will furni&s;h entertainment for the afternoon."</P>
<P>"How good you are, Madam," &s;aid Clara, "you are always thinking of us. Then ob|&s;erving that William had left the room, &s;he &s;et off in pur&s;uit of him to communicate the agreeable news."</P>

<HEAD>THE EXPLANATION, A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>"Charlotte Graves, and Maria Wilmot, were nearly of the &s;ame age: Their parents were intimate friends, and near neighbours,
<PB N="188" REF="030966_0191_0FEA0E1A4B824618">
which cau&s;ed the children to be much toge|ther, &s;trengthened the affection, which, in the tender years of infancy exi&s;ted between them; but this friendly intercour&s;e was early i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">terrupted; the declining &s;tate of Mrs. Wilmot's health rendering it nece&s;&s;a|ry &s;he &s;hould breathe her native air. Mr. Wilmot purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate in Wales, to which he &s;hortly retired with his family. Maria was at this time eight years of age, and her friend Charlotte ju&s;t twelve months younger. The little girls &s;hed many tears at parting, promi&s;ed to love each other al|ways, and as they had both been for &s;ome|time in joining-hand, to write to each other often.</P>
<P>"The year after the retirement of Mr. Wilmot, Charlotte had the misfortune to lo&s;e her mother, who died &s;uddenly, and a per&s;on from France was engaged to &s;uperin|tend her education. Had this lady been worthy the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in her, all had been well; but, unfortunately, no one more improper could po&s;&s;ibly have been cho&s;en. Her manners were indeed poli&s;hed; her ad|dre&s;s was in&s;inuating, but &s;he was wholly without principle or &s;entiment; beauty, &s;plender and riches, were in her e&s;timation, the chief ble&s;&s;ings of life, and if &s;he had a view beyond her own intere&s;t, which &s;he endeavoured to promote, by flattering her
<PB N="189" REF="030966_0192_0FEA0E1BF7596B18">
follies, it was to poli&s;h the manners of her pupil, rather then to cultivate her under|&s;tanding or to form her heart.</P>
<P>"At the early age of nine, with a mind little turned to reflection, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that Charlotte &s;hould imbibe the follies and prejudices of her governante; &s;he readily be|lieved, that providence, in giving her beau|ty, had be&s;towed on her its choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ing; and while &s;he &s;pared no attention to embel|li&s;h her per&s;on, &s;uffered her under&s;tanding to lie wholly neglected. Vain, frivolous, fond of admiration, her follies, by indul|gence, &s;welled into vices; among which, envy and detraction were not the lea&s;t con|&s;picuous; her heart &s;ickened at perfection in another, and her tongue was ever ready to depreciate the excellence &s;he could not attain.</P>
<P>"Maria, in the mean while, was rapidly improving in every amiable virtue and ele|gant accompli&s;hment. She, too, had lo&s;t her mother, but the kind attention of her father, who dedicated the chief of his time to her improvement, and the tenderne&s;s of a maid|en aunt, who re&s;ided with them, &s;oftened the &s;everity of her misfortune: &s;he already perfectly under&s;tood three languages, was mi&s;tre&s;s of geography, played incompara|ply on the pedal harp, and di&s;covered a great ta&s;te for painting; but the&s;e accom|pli&s;hments,
<PB N="190" REF="030966_0193_0FEA0E1DCE9C14F0">
though joined to a hand&s;ome per&s;on, con&s;tituted but a &s;mall part of her perfections. Her piety, her re&s;pectful affec|tion to her father and aunt, her &s;weetne&s;s of temper, her gentlene&s;s, her humility, added a &s;uperior lu&s;tre to her character; every one loved, every one admired, every one e&s;teem|ed her. Her accompli&s;hments and virtues, at length reached the ear of her friend Charlotte, who, at fir&s;t paid little attention to what &s;he heard; but when two or three families, who had made excur&s;ions into the part of the country where Mr. Wilmot liv|ed, thinking to give her plea&s;ure, was lavi&s;h in the commendations of her old friend, &s;he felt a pang that &s;he with difficulty conceal|ed, and from this moment &s;uch are the bale|ful effects of envy, experienced a decline in the affection &s;he had, till now, entertained for Maria.</P>
<P>"During five years that had ela&s;ped, &s;ince their &s;eparation, letters had con&s;tantly pa&s;t between them, but the corre&s;pondence on the part of Charlotte now became le&s;s plea&s;ing: The mo&s;t affectionate epi&s;tles lie unan&s;wered for months, and at la&s;t excited only a formal apology; this was by degrees omitted, and in the end the corre&s;pondence cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Among Mr. Graves' friends was an old Baronet, remarkable for his cheerfulne&s;s
<PB N="191" REF="030966_0194_0FE9FD0E7A99C138">
and good-humour; though upwards of &s;e|venty, he was always the fir&s;t to promote a party of plea&s;ure for the young people, and had for &s;ome time promi&s;ed to give them a ball. The day was at la&s;t fixed, and all his young friends invited. Charlotte, among the re&s;t, was not a little plea&s;ed, to receive a card of invitation; &s;he immediately flew to con&s;ult with her governe&s;s upon what dre&s;s &s;he &s;hould appear in, being determined, &s;he &s;aid, not to be outdone by any in the ball room. Mademoi&s;elle applauded her re&s;olu|tion, and tapping her on the cheek," &s;aid, "it would be a&s;hame, if, with that pretty face, &s;he did not out &s;hine every one there." The important matter was then entered upon, and &s;upplied conver&s;ation till the hap|py day arrived; when, with all the advan|tages an expen&s;ive dre&s;s could give to a per|&s;on really hand&s;ome, though &s;poilt by affec|tation and &s;elf &s;ufficiency, &s;he cutered the ball-room, where a croud of young people, with happy countenances, were a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>"The minuets being over, and country dances propo&s;ed, a young lady of the mo&s;t engaging a&s;pect was pre&s;ented by Sir Willi|am (for &s;o the gentleman who gave the en|tertainment was called) to Charlotte for a partner. They went down &s;everal dances, to their mutual &s;atisfaction, when Charlotte, under&s;tanding that her partner was a little
<PB N="192" REF="030966_0195_0FEA0E24931DEFA8">
indi&s;po&s;ed with the head-ache, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould de&s;i&s;t. This the young lady refu&s;ed, till repeatedly a&s;&s;ured it would be equally agreeable to her companion, when &s;he con&s;ented, and they &s;at down.</P>
<P>"What delightful dancers," ob&s;erved Mi&s;s Shirley, for that was the name of Char|lotte's partner, "are tho&s;e two young ladies! It is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine any thing more graceful than their movements; I have not been able to keep my eyes off them the whole evening."</P>
<P>"Whether you think them fine dancers or not," replied Charlotte, "I will an&s;wer for it they think them&s;elves &s;o."</P>
<P>"There is nothing," returned the young lady, "a&s;&s;uming in their deportment, they appear to be perfectly mode&s;t and unaf|fected."</P>
<P>"P&s;ha," &s;aid Charlotte, "it is ea&s;y to put on an air of mode&s;ty; but I have known them long, and could always through that di&s;cover a great deal of arro|gance and &s;elf-conceit."</P>
<P>"We &s;hould endeavour to judge favora|bly of every one," &s;aid Mi&s;s Shirley; per|haps you wrong them?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Charlotte; "I am &s;eldom deceived in my opinion. They are twins; pray, do you think them hand&s;ome?"</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="030966_0196_0FEA0E263140E300">
"Yes," replied Mi&s;s Shirley, "e&s;peci|ally &s;he in the white lute&s;tring; her eyes are beautiful."</P>
<P>"Why, yes," rejoined Charlotte, "her eyes are certainly fine; but do you not think there is a little of the vixen in them? I have always ob&s;erved, that where there is &s;o much fine, the temper is turbulent."</P>
<P>"It is illiberal," returned Mi&s;s Shirley, "to form your opinion upon &s;uch proof; how often do we find an amiable di&s;po&s;iti|on concealed under the mo&s;t irregular fea|tures, and the rever&s;e where the counte|nance promi&s;es every thing amiable?"</P>
<P>"Your argument," replied Charlotte, "may hold good in &s;ome ca&s;es; but, de|pend upon it, Mary Danvers is a vixen."</P>
<P>"You are very &s;evere," &s;aid Mi&s;s Shir|ley; "but pray, do you not think the young lady, who &s;tands next, very hand|&s;ome?"</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Charlotte, "if we give her credit for the white and red of her com|plexion."</P>
<P>"What do you mean?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Shir|ley.</P>
<P>"You know," replied Charlotte, "there is &s;uch a thing as rouge and white paint."</P>
<P>"I have heard &s;o," returned the young lady.</P>
<P>"I have been told," &s;aid Charlotte,
<PB N="194" REF="030966_0197_0FEA0E2807C72278">
"that Mi&s;s Fairfax &s;ometimes pays a vi&s;it to her mamma's paint boxes."</P>
<P>"And can you believe it?" &s;aid Mi&s;s Shirley. "How ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e a girl of thirteen or fourteen (I am &s;ure &s;he does not appear to be older) would paint, or that her parents would permit her."</P>
<P>"Such things," returned Charlotte, "do however happen: Why now, perhaps, you think the flaxen ringlets of her partner pure nature."</P>
<P>"They appear to be &s;o," &s;aid Mi&s;s Shir|ley.</P>
<P>"Ah," &s;aid Charlotte, "appearances are often deceitful."</P>
<P>"You are very &s;atirical," &s;aid Mi&s;s Shir|ley; "but here comes one in whom I think you mu&s;t allow beauty of per&s;on and good &s;en&s;e to unite.</P>
<P>"Do you mean Lady Eliza Elwin?"</P>
<P>"The &s;ame," &s;aid Mi&s;s Shirley; "you mu&s;t confe&s;s that &s;he is very amiable and ac|compli&s;hed, and as to beauty of per&s;on few can, I think, exceed her."</P>
<P>"Why, Lady Eliza," returned Char|lotte, "is certainly affable; her conver&s;a|tion too is what the world terms agreeable; though, in my opinion, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ture of the female pedant, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> allow is horrid; but, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> though regular, they want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> laugh when I &s;ay, I never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

For my own part, I am not fond of tho&s;e &s;leepy downca&s;t eyes; I al|ways &s;u&s;pect that &s;omething more is conceal|ed under them than people are aware of. Between you and I, I have heard it whi&s;|pered, that Lady Eliza, with all that &s;oftne&s;s, is not the be&s;t tempered; but &s;ome people take a malicious plea&s;ure in &s;candalizing their neighbours."</P>
<P>"Who," &s;aid Mrs. Shirley, "may hope to e&s;cape, if Lady Eliza is cen&s;ured &s;o un|ju&s;tly! She la&s;t year pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome weeks in Radnor&s;hire; I had, therefore, frequent op|portunities of meeting her, and, a&s;&s;ure you, I found her a mo&s;t amiable accompli&s;hed young lady; and as to her temper, I have been told by her mo&s;t intimate friends, that few can boa&s;t one more equal."</P>
<P>"I &s;ee," returned Charlotte, "that &s;he is a favorite of yours&mdash;we will, therefore, change the &s;ubject. Pray, did not you men|tion Radnor&s;hire? Do you re&s;ide in that part of Wales?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Shirley replied, that &s;he did; and added, it was &s;carcely a week &s;ince &s;he left it.</P>

I &s;ee &s;he is not &s;o great a favourite as Lady Eliza; but no matter, you have, I dare &s;ay, your rea&s;ons; one cannot you know, be wholly blind to the faults of one's friends: in truth, we have all faults; &s;ome of one kind, and &s;ome of another, though none is, to be &s;ure, wor&s;e than a covetous temper."</P>
<P>"Do you mean," &s;aid Mi&s;s Shirley, "that Maria Wilmot is covetous?"</P>
<P>"Somewhat that way inclined," return|ed Charlotte; "but, as I ob&s;erved before, we have all our faults."</P>
<P>"But my dear Mi&s;s," &s;aid Charlotte's part|ner, "with earne&s;tne&s;s, tell me, have you rea&s;on for entertaining &s;uch an opinion? Surely, no heart, that is not lo&s;t to every no|ble &s;entiment, can harbour &s;o de&s;picable a vice as covetou&s;ne&s;s."</P>

Charlotte: but it is I believe too true, that covetou&s;ne&s;s is poor Maria Wilmot's failing; what is your opinion?"</P>
<P>"I never thought it &s;o," replied Mi&s;s Shirley, "but 'tis po&s;&s;ible I may be blinded by partiality."</P>
<P>"Depend upon it," replied Charlotte, "you are; I could give you twenty in&s;tan|ces of her &s;tingine&s;s: Would you believe it, &s;he has never had a cap nor mantua made in London &s;ince her father retired into Wales! Now, as to ta&s;te, I have been told &s;he has a great deal; therefore it can only proceed from her &s;tingy di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>"But &s;he is at pre&s;ent young," returned Mi&s;s Shirley, "and it is po&s;&s;ible may not conduct the&s;e matters her&s;elf."</P>
<P>"O, I beg your pardon," returned Char|lotte, "her father is &s;o extravagantly fond of her, that he does not contradict her in any thing, and, I have been credibly in|formed, &s;uffers her to draw on him for any money &s;he plea&s;es."</P>
<P>"If that be the ca&s;e," returned Mi&s;s Shirley, "it behoves her to be cautious of abu&s;ing the confidence he is &s;o generous as to repo&s;e in her."</P>

<P>"I have been told," replied Mi&s;s Shirley, "that cards, and al&s;o raffling, as being a &s;pecies of gaming, were two things to which her mamma had a particular objection."</P>
<P>"But her mother has been dead the&s;e three years," replied the ungenerous Char|lotte, "it is, therefore, very unlikely &s;he would be &s;o &s;crupulous on that account: No, no, depend upon it, &s;he does not love to part with money. I'll tell you another anecdote I heard, upon authority equally as good, which proves her meanne&s;s beyond all di&s;pute.

<P>"It would be a glorious ta&s;k," &s;aid Char|lotte, "to &s;et about reforming the world. Why now, Maria Wilmot and I have from our infancy been friends, and till within the&s;e la&s;t two years corre&s;pondents; but I&mdash;"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Shirley looked a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;"Is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid &s;he, "that you can be Mi&s;s Graves, the friend and corre&s;pondent of Ma|ria Wilmot?"</P>
<P>"The very &s;ame," returned Charlotte; "but you &s;eem &s;urprized."</P>
<P>"I," &s;aid Mi&s;s Shirley, "am really Ma|ria Wilmot, your old friend and corre&s;pon|dent.

<P>"Mi&s;s Shirley pitied and wi&s;hed to relieve her embarra&s;&s;ment; but at this moment Sir William, accompanied by her father and Mr. Graves, who had ju&s;t entered, came up to them. They &s;oon under&s;tood that an ex|planation had taken place between the young ladies, and told them, that having a mind to heighten the plea&s;ure of their meeting, after &s;o long an ab&s;ence, by the &s;urpri&s;e, they had purpo&s;ely introduced them to each other as &s;trangers, and did not intend that the eclairci&s;&s;ement &s;hould have taken place, till they were all a&s;&s;embled at &s;upper: "but," continued Mr. Graves, in a jocular &s;train, "I find there is no po&s;&s;ibility of keep|ing a &s;ecret where girls are concerned: you were determined to be before hand with us."</P>

on the &s;ubject; but her voice faltered&mdash;&s;he knew not where to begin, and at length, having for &s;ome hours laboured under the mo&s;t unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, &s;he returned home full of &s;hame and vexation. When retired to her chamber, &s;he had lei&s;ure to reflect coolly on the occurrences of the evening, and could not but admire the conduct of Maria, who during the whole cour&s;e of it, had generou&s;ly endeavoured, by every kind and polite attention, to di&s;&s;ipate her chagrin, and convince her &s;he harboured no re&s;ent|ment on account of the pa&s;t. "Maria," &s;aid Charlotte, "is certainly very generous; how unfortunate that I &s;hould not know her!

<P>"Fortunately for Charlotte, Mademoi|&s;elle had for &s;ome time left the family, and was gone to re&s;ide with a relation in France: tho&s;e good impre&s;&s;ions, therefore, which Charlotte had in her infancy imbibed, from the precepts and example of an amiable mother, and which, though &s;tifled by flat|tery and ill advice, were not eradicated, had time to operate.

the&s;e &s;imple memorandums: &s;he blu&s;hed at the thought of her own inju&s;tice, which had a&s;cribed to avarice an oeconomy, which e|vidently appeared to proceed from the mo&s;t generous of motives: Vanity had hitherto been a leading feature in her character, but when, in every in&s;tance, &s;he compared her own conduct with that of her friend, &s;he could not but feel her inferiority. Ab&s;orb|ed in thought, &s;ometimes looking on the memorandums, and &s;ometimes reflecting on the &s;triking contra&s;t they formed to her own, &s;he continued with the book in her hand, till the entrance of Mi&s;s Shirley re|called her to a &s;en&s;e of the impropriety of her &s;ituation, and revived in her mind all the circum&s;tances for which &s;he came to a|pologize.</P>

<P>"Think no more of it," my dear &s;aid Maria, "my own conduct, in the in&s;tance to which you allude, was by no means free

<P>"You are very generous," &s;aid Char|lotte, "but my conduct was unpardona|ble."</P>
<P>"Think no more of it," &s;aid Maria, "per|haps you thought you had rea&s;on for what you &s;aid; but time will, I hope, ju&s;tify me in your opinion."</P>
<P>"O, my dear Mi&s;s Shirley, my dear Ma|ria," &s;aid Charlotte, "this (pointing to the memorandum book) proves you to be every thing that is great and amiable: yet, even your ju&s;tification covers me with &s;hame, how mean mu&s;t I appear in thus indelicately &s;atis|fying my curio&s;ity!"</P>

With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I am &s;orry the peru|&s;al of a few in&s;ignificant memorandums &s;hould expo&s;e me to encomiums of which I am &s;o wholly unde&s;erving."</P>
<P>"I &s;incerely," &s;aid Charlotte, "a&s;k your pardon for my indelicacy; but I cannot, in this in&s;tance, repent it.

O, Ma|ria, what money have I not lavi&s;hed in dre&s;s, trinkets, cards, and I know not how many frivolous things of the &s;ame kind, yet at this moment, cannot call to mind one &s;ingle action capable of affording me a plea&s;ing re|flection!"</P>

<P>"How kind!" &s;aid Charlotte, "to re|collect this ob&s;ervation of your mamma, to apologize for my extravagance!"</P>
<P>"Yet you," my dear Maria, "are con|&s;tantly, I &s;ee, depriving your&s;elf of plea|&s;ures that you may di&s;tribute comforts to others."</P>

<P>"You a&s;cribe to me, my dear," &s;aid Ma|ria, "much more merit than I de&s;erve; with re&s;pect to you and I, all that can be &s;aid is, that we differ in our ideas of plea&s;ure; <HI>you</HI> have, perhaps, been told, that it is to be found in company and public amu&s;ements, and I was early taught to &s;eek it in retire|ment, books, the &s;ociety of &s;elect friends, and e&s;pecially in contributing to the happi|ne&s;s of others."</P>

<P>"Do not," &s;aid Maria, &s;eeing Charlotte overwhelmed by the bitterne&s;s of the&s;e re|flections, "di&s;tre&s;s your&s;elf by reverting with a &s;everity too great on your pa&s;t errors; it is enough then you are &s;en&s;ible of them, and mean to make atonement by your fu|ture conduct; remember them now only as they may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure you from a relap&s;e, and to teach you, while you per&s;e|vere your&s;elf in the path of rectitude, to view with an eye of pity and compa&s;&s;ion the failings of others. Detraction is certain|ly a dete&s;table vice: my father has often ob|&s;erved to me, that it comprehends many vices, particularly tho&s;e of envy and inju&s;|tice; "I never knew a per&s;on," &s;ays he, fond of detraction, that was not envious, nor did I ever find &s;uch a one, in the lea&s;t &s;crupulous, whether he indulged this vice at the expence of innocence or guilt."</P>
<P>"Surely," &s;aid Charlotte, "I &s;hall never more be guilty of it! 'Tis indeed odious! but I have &s;o long indulged it, that, I fear, I &s;hall find it difficult to overcome. You, my dear Maria, mu&s;t be my con&s;tant mo|nitor."</P>

&s;aid Mrs. Mills, "&s;ince the&s;e <HI>common</HI> birds are &s;o familiar to you, ob&s;erved the con|&s;truction of their ne&s;ts: Tell me, do you think you could form any thing &s;o admira|bly fitted to the purpo&s;e for which they are de&s;igned?"</P>
<P>"The ne&s;ts," &s;aid William&mdash;"The ne&s;ts&mdash;Why really I don't know&mdash;To be &s;ure, I have taken many, but I never paid much attention to any thing but the birds that were in them&mdash;I know they are made of gra&s;s or mo&s;s, or &s;omething of that &s;ort."</P>
<P>"Thus it is," &s;aid his aunt, "that we daily pa&s;s over a thou&s;and objects, which, if le&s;s familiar, would excite our highe&s;t ad|miration! But, my dear William, had I known you had ever committed &s;o cruel a theft, I &s;hould not have &s;u&s;pected that you had ever con&s;idered attentively the con|&s;truction of a bird's ne&s;t, and con&s;equently the labour it mu&s;t have co&s;t the little war|bler you deprived of it."</P>
<P>William hung his head, and was &s;ilent&mdash;and Clara took this opportunity of enquiring whether all the birds of our woods built their ne&s;ts in the &s;ame manner?</P>
<P>"All of the &s;ame &s;pecies," Mrs. Mills re|plied, "build invariably alike, but they vary according to their different kind: The wren, for example, builds her ne&s;t in the form of a &s;ugar loaf, leaving a hole about

the middle for a pa&s;&s;age in and out, through which &s;he not only &s;upplies her young with food, but conveys out all their dung, which would otherwi&s;e &s;oil the ne&s;t.&mdash;The tit|mou&s;e curiou&s;ly interweaves its ne&s;t with mo&s;s, hair, and reeds&mdash;The black-bird, lapwing, and many others, rough ca&s;t the in&s;ide of the ne&s;t, with a lay of mortar, and by the help of a little flue or mo&s;s, with which they temper it while &s;oft, form a complete wall within.&mdash;Many birds connect the different parts of their ne&s;t with a thread, which they weave from hemp or hair, but more commonly from the webs of &s;piders.&mdash;When the &s;wallow has occa&s;i|on to build her ne&s;t, &s;he wets her brea&s;t up|on the &s;urface of the water, and &s;hedding the moi&s;ture over the du&s;t, works it up with her bill, and thus forms a pla&s;ter or cement, of which &s;he con&s;tructs a commo|dious habitation for her young family. The martin does the &s;ame, but covers her ne&s;t at the top, leaving a hole at the &s;ide, for a pa&s;&s;age in and out."</P>
<P>"There is indeed," &s;aid William, "great ingenuity in all this&mdash;it mu&s;t co&s;t the little creatures great trouble and fatigue&mdash;I never thought about it before, but it is cer|tainly cruel to deprive them of their little ones, after they have taken &s;uch pains to pre|pare for their reception."</P>

"You would &s;ay &s;o, William," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "if you knew all the cares they un|dergo; as &s;oon as the eggs, which are to produce the young birds, are laid, the male and female brood over them by turns, with the mo&s;t painful per&s;everance, and when the young family make their appearance, encounter every danger and fatigue to provide for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: they are con&s;tantly in pur&s;uit of provi&s;ions, fir&s;t one and then the other, and &s;ometimes both together, and di&s;tribute the food they bring home with the greate&s;t equality."</P>
<P>"I thought," &s;aid Clara, "that all the care of hatching and rearing the young brood fell to the female."</P>
<P>"It principally does," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "but the male has his part al&s;o: he allevi|ates the fatigue of his faithful mate by a thou&s;and tender a&s;&s;iduities: while &s;he is con|fined to the eggs, he brings her food, occa|&s;ionally takes his turn in brooding them, and, when the young birds appear, &s;hares equal|ly with her the fatigue of providing them food: I had a male Canary bird, which per|formed the office of a very kind father to &s;ome young linnets."</P>
<P>"To &s;ome young linnets madam!" ex|claimed the young people.</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "I'll tell you how it happened. I had once a ne&s;t of lin|ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">

As the mi&s;chief could not be remedied, I admoni&s;hed him as to the future, and took the young ne&s;tlings under my protection. The ne&s;t had not been long in my dre&s;&s;ing-room, before I ob&s;erved that the chirping the little creatures made, either for food or the warmth of the mother, was an&s;wered by a fine Canary bird, which hung in the room, with that &s;oft &s;ort of twittering birds u&s;ual|ly make to their young. This in&s;pired me with the thought of trying whether he would rear the young linnets: I according|ly put the ne&s;t into the cage, and found the experiment &s;ucceed; my little Phily, for &s;o I called my Canary bird, in&s;tantly left his perch, and brooded over the young linnets, as the mother would have done. I then put &s;ome proper food into the cage, and had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him drop fir&s;t a mor&s;el in|to the mouth of one, then another, till he had &s;atisfied the whole family, which he actually, in this manner, &s;upported till they were capable of providing for them|&s;elves."</P>

to get a ne&s;t of young birds, and try if they would do the &s;ame."</P>
<P>"Be cautious," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "of trying the experiment, le&s;t the young birds &s;uffer. 'Tis true, it has once &s;ucceeded, but that is no rea&s;on it &s;hould always; tho' you have &s;een a cat fo&s;ter a chicken, &s;uch another in&s;tance may not occur in the cour&s;e of your life."</P>
<P>"Pray, madam," &s;aid William, "would Canary birds do you think live in our woods?"</P>
<P>"By no means," rejoined Mrs. Mills, "our climate is by far too cold, great at|tention and care is requi&s;ite in the breed of them even in hou&s;es."</P>
<P>"But in the Canary I&s;les," &s;aid William, "I &s;uppo&s;e they are as common as black|birds and thru&s;hes are with us?"</P>
<P>"Probably they are," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "but their colour there is a du&s;ky grey, and they are &s;o different from tho&s;e &s;een in En|gland, that many people have doubted whe|ther they are of the &s;ame &s;pecies. The Canary birds we &s;ee here are imported from Germany, where they are bred in great numbers, and &s;old to different parts of Europe."</P>

<P>The little girl, who was the &s;ubject of the enquiry, hung her head; her cheeks were immediately covered with blu&s;hes, and Mrs. Brown replied, "that Polly Ben|net was doing penance for a fault &s;he had committed three weeks ago, added, that &s;he had rea&s;on to hope &s;he &s;incerely re|pented."</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="030966_0228_0FEA0E74C01B05F8">

<P>"The little girl &s;aid, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, &s;he de&s;erved to be puni&s;hed, and that &s;he &s;hould not mind what &s;he &s;uffered, if &s;he could but once gain the good opinion of her mi&s;tre&s;s and &s;chool fellows; the latter of whom, &s;he &s;aid, &s;hunned her as much out of &s;chool as they did in."</P>

<HEAD>THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH, A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>"Emily was the acknowledged child and heire&s;s of Sir James Golding, a wealthy ba|ronet, in the we&s;t of England:</P>
<P>"Amiable in her temper, gentle in her manners, beloved and admired by all who knew her, &s;he had reached her thirteenth year, a &s;tranger to care or misfortune: then, for a while, the calm was interrupted, and &s;he was unexpectedly involved in a &s;cene of trouble and perplexity.&mdash;A &s;ervant, for whom Emily had conceived a &s;trong affection, had for &s;ometime been declining in her health, and, at la&s;t grew &s;o bad that her life was de&s;paired of.</P>
<P>"One day, as Emily was &s;itting at her bed &s;ide, &s;he heaved a deep &s;igh, and pre&s;|&s;ing the hand of her young mi&s;tre&s;s, with a look that be&s;poke a mind di&s;turbed and agonized," "my dear child," &s;aid &s;he, "I have &s;omething heavy at my heart, which I wi&s;h, yet dread to communicate&mdash;I have been very wicked, but what is done cannot be undone."</P>
<P>"Emily begged &s;he would be compo&s;ed, and tell her if there were any thing &s;he could do to relieve her mind."</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="030966_0232_0FEA0E7EB016C698">
"Promi&s;e me," &s;aid Alice, "that you will not di&s;cover to any one what I am now going to tell you; you are young, but have di&s;cretion above your years."</P>
<P>"If it be a &s;ecret, that I can keep with honour," &s;aid the prudent Emily, "depend upon my &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"Alas," &s;aid Alice, "it is of moment to your future peace and welfare; but tell me fir&s;t, had you a mother, poor, mean, friendle&s;s, would you not turn from her with di&s;gu&s;t and aver&s;ion?"</P>
<P>"My good Alice," &s;aid Emily, "whither does this que&s;tion lead: I was never &s;o hap|py as to know a mother; but, if I were, can you &s;uppo&s;e that poverty would not en|dear her to me?"</P>
<P>"Amiable child!" exclaimed Alice, "in me then"&mdash;and here &s;he &s;topped&mdash;<Q>in me then behold that unhappy mother.</Q></P>
<P>"The&s;e words were incomprehen&s;ible to Emily; &s;he looked on Alice in &s;ilent ex|pectation of what was to follow&mdash;but find|ing &s;he did not proceed&mdash;"Alice," &s;aid &s;he, "what does all this mean? you are not light-headed, nor am I &s;urely in a dream, yet how can I under&s;tand you! Did you not &s;ay &s;omething of mother?"</P>
<P>"I did," &s;aid Alice, "I am indeed your unhappy mother."</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="030966_0233_0FEA0E8382576168">
"Impo&s;&s;ible!" exclaimed Emily, "my mother died when I was &s;carcely a fortnight old: you have &s;ome &s;ecret view in this un|truth, and want to impo&s;e on my credulity; my father, as &s;oon as he returns, (for Sir James was out upon a journey) mu&s;t be ac|quainted with this." Having &s;aid thus, Emily was ri&s;ing with indignation, to leave the room, when Alice, collecting all her &s;trength, caught hold of her gown, and en|treated to be heard."</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>Emily relented, and &s;itting down once more, li&s;tened to a tale, that agitated her young heart with a thou&s;and new and pain|ful emotions. The purport was this: Sir James, during his minority, had impru|dently contracted a &s;ecret marriage, and was &s;hortly after obliged to &s;et out upon his travels: this affected his poor lady &s;o much, that &s;he lived only to become the mother of a fine girl, which &s;he committed to the care of Alice, who had formerly been her nur&s;e, and at who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he then lodged. Alice had unfortunately a little girl, within a few days of the &s;ame age, and this in&s;pired her with the wicked thought of aggrandizing her own child, at the ex|pence of Sir James's. She accordingly gave it the name of Emily, after the de|cea&s;ed Lady Golding, and when Sir James, the following year, returned to England,
<PB N="231" REF="030966_0234_0FEA0E85211BF7A8">
impo&s;ed it on him for his own offspring, which, in the mean time, &s;he called Patty, and bred up as her daughter. Ten years having elap&s;ed &s;ince this tran&s;action. Alice thought it time to profit by her wicked ar|tifice; with this de&s;ign &s;he offered her&s;elf to &s;upply the place of Emily's maid, who had lately left the family, thinking, in this &s;ituation, to ingratiate her&s;elf by degrees into the affections of her young mi&s;tre&s;s, and, when &s;he arrived at years of di&s;cretion, to intru&s;t her with the &s;ecret of her birth, and lay claim to her future &s;ervices, by re|pre&s;enting the &s;acrifice &s;he had made in her behalf, or, if this failed, to intimidate her by the fear of a di&s;covery: Alice had, however, continued more than three years an inmate of the family, and had not yet ventured to entru&s;t Emily with a &s;ecret of &s;uch importance. The pro&s;pect, however, of her di&s;&s;olution, gave a new turn to her ideas, her crime now &s;tood before her in its true deformity; &s;he reflected with angui&s;h on the inju&s;tice &s;he had committed, and though &s;he had not courage to repair the injury &s;he had done, &s;he could not die in peace without recommending Patty, the injured daughter of Sir James, to the care and protection of Emily. Such were the motives which prompted this unhapy woman to the confe&s;|&s;ion &s;he had ju&s;t made, and the reader mu&s;t
<PB N="232" REF="030966_0235_0FEA0E878B65DCA8">
form to his imagination the effect it pro|duced on the mind of Emily, &s;ince her emotions were too various, and too power|ful, for words to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Shocked at the crime of which Alice had been guilty, yet impre&s;&s;ed with a high &s;en&s;e of the duty due to her, however faulty, as a parent, Emily could only weep, and in &s;ilence lament, till the entrance of a &s;er|vant afforded her an opportunity of with|drawing, to calm the tumult of her mind.</P></Q>
<P>"When Emily was alone, and began cooly to reflect on the events Alice had un|folded, her mind was &s;till more di&s;ordered and perplexed:" "What a change," &s;aid &s;he, "has a &s;hort hour made! but now I thought my&s;elf the child of Sir James Golding, heire&s;s to a va&s;t e&s;tate&mdash;what am I now? I am afraid to think&mdash;Alice, had in|deed rea&s;on to &s;ay the &s;ecret was of impor|tance! Should Sir James di&s;cover it, what will become of me&mdash;of my poor mother&mdash;I tremble at the thought&mdash;but who will ac|quaint him! Alice &s;ays my father is dead, no one but &s;he and my&s;elf know the truth&mdash;I will, therefore, think no more about it." Saying this, Emily went into the garden. and began to bu&s;y her&s;elf about her flowers; from thence &s;he vi&s;ited her birds, hoping, by the&s;e means to divert her anxiety, but her thoughts in&s;en&s;ibly returned to the &s;ub|ject
<PB N="233" REF="030966_0236_0FEA0E8C968E6DE8">
of her inquietude: "How can I," &s;aid &s;he, "look my dear father, for &s;he could not forbear u&s;ing the appellation, in the face, while I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a &s;ecret. Every kind word or look he addre&s;&s;es to me will reproach me&mdash;What can I do? Confe&s;s the truth to Sir James?&mdash;he is all kindne&s;s and indulgence now&mdash;but then&mdash;he will no longer love me, when he finds I am not his own Emily: I &s;hall forever lo&s;e his affection; that is hard, yet what is &s;o bad as fal&s;ehood and deceit; it is cer|tainly my duty to confe&s;s the truth; and how often, as my dear father told me, there is no &s;atisfaction equal to the performing of it.&mdash;But will Alice con&s;ent? &s;he is my mo|ther, and I ought to obey her. I will try if I cannot prevail upon her."</P>
<P>"When Emily returned to the chamber of Alice, &s;he took her hand affectionately between her's," how is it, my poor mother" &s;aid &s;he, "are you more compo&s;ed than when we la&s;t parted&mdash;have you &s;lept?"</P>
<P>"Alice replied, that it was long &s;ince &s;he had known compo&s;ure;" "the inju&s;tice I have done," &s;aid &s;he, "pre&s;&s;es heavy on my heart, and I find, too late, that guilt brings along with it its own puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>"Well my poor Alice," &s;aid Emily, "make your&s;elf ea&s;y, there is &s;till a remedy&mdash;confe&s;s the truth to Sir James, his child
<PB N="234" REF="030966_0237_0FEA0E8E3933D838">
&s;till lives, and he is very generous and kind&mdash;I am &s;ure I have always found him &s;o."</P>
<P>"What is it I hear!" exclaimed the un|happy woman; have you con&s;idered&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I have con&s;idered every thing," &s;aid Emily, "it is the only reparation you can make; and indeed you owe it both to Sir James, and Patty."</P>
<P>"Think," &s;aid Alice, who little expect|ed &s;uch a propo&s;al, "what you will &s;uffer, &s;hould Sir James, which he certainly will, withdraw his protection from you; think how his confidence has been abu&s;ed; in what a tender point he has been injured&mdash;indeed, my child, there is no hope of his forgivene&s;s, though innocent, he will not con&s;ider you le&s;s the cau&s;e of the impo&s;ition which has been pa&s;&s;ed upon him, and will drive you out to &s;hare the poverty of your unhappy mother."</P>
<P>"I do not fear poverty," &s;aid Emily, "for riches cannot afford &s;atisfaction, if ac|quired unju&s;tly; but I own, the thought of lo&s;ing my dear father's, I mean Sir James's affection, affects me &s;en&s;ibly;" yet, my dear mother, it is our duty to acquaint him with the truth, and let the con&s;equence be what they will, to perform it."</P>
<P>"Alice &s;eemed much agitated; for <HI>mine,</HI> if not for your own &s;ake," &s;aid &s;he, "I charge
<PB N="235" REF="030966_0238_0FEA0E906AEA9E38">
you to keep the &s;ecret I have unfolded: I, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t be the victim of Sir James's re&s;entment, and think what would en&s;ue, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, in this weak &s;tate, to be turned friendle&s;s into the wide world."</P>
<P>"This &s;ugge&s;tion touched the tender heart of Emily: no, &s;aid &s;he, "Sir James is generous; I will throw my&s;elf on my knees before him, and &s;often him in your behalf&mdash;if I fail, I will con&s;ole you, work for you&mdash;and &s;hare your poverty; I would not enjoy affluence, were it in my power, while my mother was in mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>"Alice was affected, and half per&s;uaded, by the&s;e artle&s;s arguments. Emily ob&s;erved it with joy, but fearing a continuance of the di&s;cour&s;e, would be too much for her, in her pre&s;ent weak condition, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed her for the pre&s;ent, no further, but promi&s;|ing to return in a &s;hort time, left her to re|po&s;e."</P>
<P>"Though the mind of Emily was di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed by a thou&s;and contending emotions, &s;he fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t a peace ari&s;e from having thus far performed her duty, that &s;he would not have exchanged for all the advantages riches could be&s;tow; and was enjoying the reflec|tions that aro&s;e upon this &s;ubject, when a &s;ervant entered to acquaint her, that an alarming change had taken place in Alice. Emily ha&s;tened to the chamber, and was
<PB N="236" REF="030966_0239_0FEA0E9309DB25C8">
inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hocked, to find her &s;peechle&s;s, the phy&s;ician was immediately &s;ent for, but before he arrived the unhappy &s;ufferer had breathed her la&s;t.</P>
<P>"Emily was &s;hocked at this unexpected event; but it con&s;oled her to reflect, that &s;he had, in the la&s;t interview, apparently rendered her mother &s;en&s;ible that it was her duty to make the reparation that was &s;till in her power, though Providence had &s;o ordered it that &s;he did not live to accom|pli&s;h it; that ta&s;k now devolved upon Emi|ly, and &s;he re&s;olved, painful as it might be to fulfil it&mdash;'Tis true &s;he was more than once tempted to pur&s;ue the oppo&s;ite con|duct: "Patty," &s;aid &s;he, "cannot feel the lo&s;s of what &s;he never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and does not know &s;he has a title to po&s;&s;e&s;s; when I am a woman, and have it in my power, I can be kind to her, and provide for her, and that will make her ju&s;t as happy&mdash;Then, as to Sir James, he believes me to be his child, and I am &s;ure loves me as well; and with re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I think, I may ven|ture to &s;ay, Patty could not love and honour him more than I do."&mdash;The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, added to the fear of lo&s;ing Sir James's affec|tion, which was inexpre&s;&s;ibly dear to her, tempted her to confine the &s;ecret to her own brea&s;t; but truth, which &s;he had from her infancy been accu&s;tomed to prize as the
<PB N="237" REF="030966_0240_0FEA0E94C710BF10">
mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;oon &s;ugge&s;ted bet|ter thoughts, and &s;he re&s;olved to hazard all, rather than unju&s;tly &s;upport a character which did not belong to her. She, there|fore, met Sir James upon his return the next day, fully re&s;olved to di&s;clo&s;e all, but with an embarra&s;&s;ment, ari&s;ing from the unea&s;i|ne&s;s of her mind, that did not e&s;cape his ob|&s;ervation. He enquired, with affectionate &s;olicitude, if any thing material had happen|ed in his ab&s;ence?</P>
<P>"Emily blu&s;hed, and replied, in a tre|mulous voice: "Poor Alice, Sir, is dead."</P>
<P>"Sir James was &s;urpri&s;ed, and enquired when &s;he expired?</P>
<P>"La&s;t night, Sir," &s;aid Emily, "in my arms&mdash;" She could &s;ay no more, notwith|&s;tanding all the fortitude &s;he had endea|voured to a&s;&s;ume; &s;he bur&s;t into tears.&mdash;</P>
<P>"My dear child," &s;aid Sir James, em|bracing her, "I do not blame this amiable tribute to the memory of poor Alice; but death is a debt we mu&s;t all pay; I &s;ee your &s;pirits are low, and for this the be&s;t remedy is employment: I have brought you a geo|graphical game; let us &s;ee which of us will make the be&s;t and mo&s;t expeditious tour of Europe." Saying this, he &s;pread the map upon the table, and took out the totum and counters.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="030966_0241_0FEA0E996F845A38">
"Emily, at his de&s;ire, &s;at down, and en|deavoured to attend to the rules of the game, but her thoughts in&s;en&s;ibly wandered, and her ab&s;ence of mind was &s;o vi&s;ible, that Sir James was di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Emily," &s;aid he, "your concern for a faithful dome&s;tic is certainly amiable; but it &s;hould not cau&s;e you to forget the attention and re&s;pect due a parent, who loves and &s;tudies every thing to make you happy."</P>
<P>"This was too much for the tender heart of Emily, already oppre&s;&s;ed with a weight of grief entirely new to her; &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and throwing her&s;elf upon her knees, and hiding her face with both her hands, entreated him to forgive her.</P>
<P>"Sir James, a&s;toni&s;hed at the agitation of her whole frame, rai&s;ed, and pre&s;&s;ing her to his bo&s;om: "Is it po&s;&s;ible, my dear child," &s;aid he, "that what I have &s;aid &s;hould affect you &s;o powerfully!"</P>
<P>"Ah, Sir," &s;aid Emily, &s;omewhat reliev|ed by the tears &s;he had &s;hed, "do not call me your dear child; indeed, I am unworthy that name."</P>
<P>"Sir James was &s;urpri&s;ed; but knowing the ingenious di&s;po&s;ition of Emily, judged that her words alluded to &s;ome trifling fault &s;he had committed in his ab&s;ence, and a&s;|&s;ured her of his forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="030966_0242_0FEA0E9B11ECB6F0">
"I am very unhappy," &s;aid Emily "but thank God I have nothing to reproach my|&s;elf with: O, my dear father!" (for, ac|cu&s;tomed to this epithet, &s;he uncon&s;ciou&s;ly u&s;ed it) "I am very mi&s;erable&mdash;I fear you will never again call me your dear Emily.&mdash;Indeed, indeed, papa, I am not your own child."</P>
<P>The reader will ea&s;ily conceive what mu&s;t have been the a&s;toni&s;hment of Sir James: when Emily, as well as the agi|tation of her mind would permit, related all the particulars before mentioned, and put into his hand a letter his lady had ad|dre&s;&s;ed to him a few days before her death, and committed to the care of the treach|erous Alice, who had withheld it, on ac|count of its de&s;cribing a particular mark which was vi&s;ible on the forehead of his child, and would naturally have been &s;ought for by Sir James.</P>
<P>"His a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation aro&s;e to the highe&s;t pitch&mdash;For &s;ome time he walked the room in the utmo&s;t perturba|tion of mind&mdash;Then turning to Emily, who &s;at in trembling expectation of the event, not daring to lift up her eyes to Sir James: "My deare&s;t child," &s;aid he, "my thoughts are at this moment too much di&s;turbed to pay, as I ought, the ju&s;t tribute to your noble conduct&mdash;Leave me for the

pre&s;ent&mdash;In the morning we will meet as u&s;ual."</P>
<P>"Emily withdrew to her chamber, much comforted by the&s;e kind expre&s;&s;ions, which left her no room to apprehend the re&s;ent|ment of Sir James, and gave her rea&s;on to hope for a continuance of his favour.</P>
<P>"When Emily the next morning was &s;ummoned to the breakfa&s;t table, the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the new character in which &s;he mu&s;t appear to Sir James gave a timi|dity and re&s;traint to her manners that fully informed him of all that pa&s;&s;ed in her mind: "My dear Emily," &s;aid he, taking her hand in the mo&s;t affectionate manner, "why this re&s;erve? Can you imagine that an event in which you have borne no part, but what has &s;erved to reflect on you the highe&s;t ho|nour, can have le&s;&s;ened my e&s;teem or af|fection? No, my dear, my noble girls, it has rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed both: From henceforth you can have no RIVAL in my affections, and Emily is too generous not to admit a partner."</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over, Sir James di&s;patched Rugby, a faithful dome&s;|tic who had grown old in his &s;ervice, to a village about ten miles di&s;tant, where Alice had placed Patty during her re&s;idence in Sir James' family, with orders to pay the money due for her board, and bring her
<PB N="241" REF="030966_0244_0FEA0E9FB706CAC0">
home.&mdash;Emily, in the mean while, re|tired to her chamber, to enjoy the agreea|ble reflections that aro&s;e upon her happine&s;s. How &s;incerely did &s;he rejoice in the con|duct &s;he had pur&s;ued! had &s;he acted with le&s;s integrity, how bitter had been her re|flections! For, with no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he learnt that the di&s;cour&s;e which had pa&s;&s;ed between her and Alice had been actually overheard, and when &s;he retired the even|ing before, related to Sir James by Rugby, who&s;e chamber was only divided by a thin partition from Alice's. Had Emily, there|fore, acted upon principles le&s;s noble, the very means &s;he had taken to &s;ecure to her|&s;elf the fortune <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd e&s;teem of Sir James had irretrievably deprived her of both. She looked up, therefore, with gratitude to the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of events, who had in&s;pired her with re&s;olution to hazard the lo&s;s of every worldly con&s;ideration, rather than purcha&s;e them by duplicity and inju&s;|tice. From &s;uch reflections her thoughts naturally turned upon Sir James; on his ge|nero&s;ity and kindne&s;s&mdash;and then on Patty; "I am afraid," &s;aid Emily, "&s;he is very illiterate, perhaps as ignorant and vulgar as our wa&s;hing-woman's poor child: how it will vex and mortify my dear father&mdash;I wi&s;h he were not to &s;ee her till &s;he had been at &s;chool a few months. But that cannot

<P>"Emily was delighted with this thought&mdash;the moment &s;he &s;aw Rugby, from the window, enter the court yard, &s;he flew to beg he would for a few minutes conceal his arrival from Sir James: Then, over|joyed, &s;he hurried with Patty into her chamber, where &s;he put on her one of her fine&s;t mu&s;lin frock and a dimity &s;kirt&mdash;and would have added a cap, had &s;he not been unwilling to conceal her beautiful auburn ringlets, which &s;he thought a greater orna|ment.</P>
<P>"The artle&s;s &s;implicity of Patty who viewed every thing &s;he &s;aw with wonder and ru&s;tic admiration, and the generous anxiety of Emily to embelli&s;h the per&s;on of one, who, in a mind le&s;s noble, might have excited &s;entiments of envy or jealou&s;y, formed the mo&s;t intere&s;ting contra&s;t.</P>
<P>"The bu&s;ine&s;s of the toilet being com|pleted, Emily led Patty to Sir James, who awaited her arrival with impatience. Upon her entrance, he was &s;truck with the &s;trong re&s;emblance &s;he bore to her mother, and embraced her with the tendere&s;t affection, &s;hedding abundance of tears.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="030966_0246_0FEA0EA6001C2ED8">
"Patty was quite a&s;hamed to be ki&s;&s;ed by &s;o fine a gentleman: She had been told that Sir James was her father&mdash;but the di&s;tance that appeared between them, for the pre&s;ent, entirely excluded every ten|der feeling the name might be &s;uppo&s;ed to awaken, and glad would Patty have been to hide her&s;elf in any corner from Sir James.&mdash;This ba&s;hfulne&s;s, however, in a few hours, wore away, and, in her artle&s;s ob&s;ervations, Sir James di&s;covered a mind replete with good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>"What a mind," exclaimed Sir James, "is here lo&s;t for want of culture!" Some more words he let fall that expre&s;&s;ed the keenne&s;s of his &s;en&s;ations on this &s;ubject, which being ob&s;erved by Patty, "Pray, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, looking in his face, with a &s;weet &s;implicity, "do not be angry with me&mdash;To be &s;ure, I cannot read&mdash;nor write&mdash;nor play on the mu&s;ic, as Mi&s;s Emily can&mdash;but indeed I will love you&mdash;indeed, Sir, I will."</P>
<P>"Sir James was affected by the&s;e artle&s;s expre&s;&s;ions: "Do not, my &s;weet child," &s;aid he, "imagine I &s;hall love you the le&s;s for the want of knowledge you have not the opportunities of acquiring: no, if you be good and teachable, you will be equally dear to my heart as if you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t brilliant accompli&s;hments, which after

all, acquire value only from the virtues by which they are accompanied."</P>
<P>"How happy it would make me," &s;aid Emily, "to communicate to Mi&s;s Gold|ing the knowledge you, Sir, have been &s;o kind as to give me! Will you permit me, (I will not &s;ay to be her tutore&s;s, becau&s;e I am &s;en&s;ible I am in need of one my&s;elf) but to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;o agreeable an employment? Patty has promi&s;ed to accept my &s;ervices."</P>
<P>"My dear children," &s;aid Sir James, "nothing in this world can afford me &s;uch heartfelt &s;atisfaction as to &s;ee you amicably united: Yes, my dear Patty, if you would &s;ecure my e&s;teem and affection, Emily mu&s;t be the pattern by which you mu&s;t from your conduct."</P>
<P>"Emily's eyes gli&s;tened with grateful &s;en&s;ibility at &s;o high a mark of Sir James's approbation; and Patty, taking her hand, &s;aid, "Indeed, Mi&s;s Emily, I will mind whatever you &s;ay&mdash;and will love you dear|ly, for I am &s;ure you have already been very good to me;" (alluding to the change Emily had made in her apparel, a change which, as it gave another proof of Emily's noble &s;entiments, had neither gone unnoticed nor unacknowledged by Sir James.)</P>
<P>"From this day Emily became the pre|ceptre&s;s of Patty, who&s;e attention and ap|plication was &s;uch, that &s;he improved
<PB N="245" REF="030966_0248_0FEA0EABF6E39AF0">
rapidly; her mind unfolded by degrees, and every day di&s;covered new beauties; her ba&s;hfulne&s;s changed into a becoming mode&s;ty, and in a few years the ru&s;tic cot|tager was lo&s;t in the elegant, the accom|pli&s;hed Mi&s;s Golding.</P>
<P>"The particulars of Emily's birth was known, but to few; &s;he was &s;till con&s;idered as the daughter of Sir James, who divided his affection and fortune equally, between her and Patty. The friend&s;hip of the young ladies, being, in the mean while, founded upon reciprocal virtues, was &s;trengthened by time, and proved as la&s;t|ing as it was warm and &s;incere."</P>
<P>Thus was the virtue of Emily recom|pen&s;ed by the approbation of her own heart&mdash;the e&s;teem of her benefactor&mdash;the ac|qui&s;ition of a true friend&mdash;and the pro&s;perity of her future life&mdash;illu&s;trating this u&s;eful precept; that it is no le&s;s our intere&s;t, than our duty, to adopt and encourage good principles.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>CLARA and William were much enter|tained with the &s;tory their aunt had re|lated, and a&s;&s;ured her, they would endea|vour
<PB N="246" REF="030966_0249_0FEA0EAFDA5178F8">
to cultivate the &s;ame integrity that had rendered the character of Emily &s;o e&s;tima|ble.</P>
<P>The next day being Sunday, they attend|ed their aunt to church, a place which Clara had hitherto con&s;idered as conve|nient to lounge away a few hours, on a day the lea&s;t productive of amu&s;ement of any throughout the week; &s;he had kneeled merely becau&s;e other people did &s;o, and repeated the prayers from the &s;ame mo|tive. During the &s;ermon and le&s;&s;ons, &s;he was engaged in critici&s;ing the per&s;ons and dre&s;s of the congregation, in&s;tead of at|tending to the in&s;tructions contained in either; but a week pa&s;&s;ed with Mrs. Mills had produced a &s;urpri&s;ing revolution: The exemplary conduct of that lady&mdash;her di&s;|cour&s;e, and the habit of a&s;&s;embling morn|ing and evening to prayer, had impre&s;&s;ed her with a high &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e important duties &s;he owed to her Creator, whom &s;he now addre&s;&s;ed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ervent devotion: &s;he li&s;tened with attention to an excellent di&s;|cour&s;e, and retired convinced that &s;he was created for &s;omething more than to dre&s;s, and trifle away her time in frivolous amu&s;e|ments. In their way home they vi&s;ited the Sunday &s;chool, where Clara and her bro|ther a&s;&s;i&s;ted their good aunt in examining &s;ome of the children, whom they rewarded
<PB N="247" REF="030966_0250_0FEA0EB1C6A14FB8">
and encouraged according to their &s;everal merits; a new &s;pecies of employment this to the young people, who felt, that no &s;a|tisfaction can exceed that of rendering our|&s;elves u&s;eful to others.</P>
<P>From hence the carriage conveyed them home, where they had the plea&s;ure of meet|ing Mr. Clement, who had arrived a few minutes before. My dear &s;i&s;ter, my dear children, were alternately repeated&mdash;and then, a variety of intere&s;ting &s;ubjects were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Upon Mrs. Mills leaving the room for a few minutes, Mr. Clement ob|&s;erved to the young people, that he had not exceeded the time in which he promi&s;ed to return.</P>
<P>"Ah! papa," &s;aid Clara, we are "al|ways happy to &s;ee you; but I a&s;&s;ure you, we &s;hould be more &s;o, if it were not to put an end to our vi&s;it!"</P>
<P>"How," &s;aid Mr. Clement, "did you not bind me by a promi&s;e, that it &s;hould not exceed a week!"</P>
<P>"Very true, papa," returned Clara, but then we did not know my aunt, we could not have thought the time would have pa&s;&s;ed &s;o delightfully."</P>
<P>"I conclude then," &s;aid Mr. Clement, meaning to banter, "that you have had balls, and cards, and vi&s;its, in abundance."</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="030966_0251_0FEA0EB4333C45A0">
"O, no papa, not one," &s;aid Clara, "and yet the time has fled &s;o fa&s;t, that I can &s;carcely believe it a week &s;ince you left us."</P>
<P>"Nor I, papa," &s;aid William, "and yet I have not had one play-fellow; nay, I have not &s;o much as &s;hot one marble; nor once flown my new kite."</P>
<P>"This is very extraordinary," &s;aid Mr. Clement, &s;till continuing to banter; "I cannot comprehend it."</P>
<P>"O! papa," &s;aid Clara, "my aunt is a charming woman, &s;he has been &s;o good to us! &s;he has told us all about the bees; and you know, papa, how terrified I u&s;ed to be at a &s;pider; well, it is the mo&s;t curious thing in the world! I have &s;een it &s;pin; and how many threads do you think it takes to make one that forms the web."</P>
<P>"Upon my word," &s;aid Mr. Clement, I cannot exactly tell."</P>
<P>"One thou&s;and! could you think it, papa?"</P>
<P>"The bees," &s;aid William, "delight me more than all; my aunt has a gla&s;s hive, papa, and we have &s;een them bring home the wax and honey."</P>
<P>"But you forget the queen, William," interrupted Clara; <Q>&s;he has a palace, papa, and her &s;ubjects are &s;o faithful!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="030966_0252_0FEA0EB7F79A15C8">
"We have looked through my aunt's micro&s;cope too; a fly, papa, is a mo&s;t won|derful creature! and the du&s;t on the wing of a butterfly is actually feathers."</P>
<P>"Indeed!"</P>
<P>"Yes, papa, and an earwig has two large wings, that fold up, ju&s;t like our candle &s;creens. Did you know the&s;e things, pa|pa?"</P>
<P>"I know," returned Mr. Clement, "that nature is replete with wonders."</P>
<P>"How was it then, papa, that you never mentioned them to us?"</P>
<P>"Your brother, my dear, &s;aid Mr. Cle|ment, has been ab&s;ent, and you never di&s;|covered a de&s;ire for information on &s;uch &s;ubjects."</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e, papa," interrupted Clara, "I thought it impo&s;&s;ible to be amu&s;ed without dre&s;s or company: but I &s;ee I was mi&s;taken, we have neither wanted the one nor the other here. My aunt has made us acquain|ted with &s;o many curious things! and told us &s;uch delightful &s;tories! I wi&s;h, papa, you could let us &s;tay another week? don't you, William?"</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;i&s;ter," replied William, "if pa|pa can &s;tay with us, but you know, I have been at &s;chool &s;ix months, and have had very little of his company."</P>
<P>"Very true," &s;aid Clara, "I did not think of that, but if papa can &s;tay with us?"</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="030966_0253_0FEA0EBA704E0338">
"That is a plea&s;ure," &s;aid Mr. Cle|ment, "I cannot at pre&s;ent enjoy, as I have engaged your cou&s;in Milfords to pa&s;s a few weeks with us in town; we mu&s;t &s;et off to|morrow, that we may be at home to re|ceive them."</P>
<P>At this moment Mrs. Mills entered; "my dear &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Mr. Clement, with a &s;mile, "Clara and William have been im|parting to me &s;ome of their newly acquired knowledge, and telling me how agreeably you have entertained them."</P>
<P>"I am happ," returned Mrs. Mills, "if they think &s;o."</P>
<P>"We &s;hould be very ungrateful, my dear Madam," &s;aid Clara, "not to acknow|ledge your kindne&s;s, we have pa&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t delightful week! Papa, I am &s;en&s;ible I have given you a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;I have been very idle, and inattentive; but I now &s;ee the value of knowledge, and am impatient till I have an opportunity of a|toning for the time I have lo&s;t."</P>
<P>"How happy," &s;aid Mr. Clement, "do you make me by the avowal of &s;uch &s;enti|ments! yes, my dear child, I have indeed, with concern, beheld your time daily wa&s;ted in frivolous and unprofitable amu&s;ements, and have reproached my&s;elf as, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the cau&s;e, by improper indulgence: &s;hall I confe&s;s the truth&mdash;I opened my heart
<PB N="251" REF="030966_0254_0FEA0EBC10EDD8D8">
on this &s;ubject to your aunt, who kindly in|vited you hither, in the hope of in&s;piring you with a ta&s;te for mo&s;t rational plea&s;ures: The di&s;gu&s;t you conceived to the vi&s;it in|duced me (too much accu&s;tomed to indulge your inclinations) to limit it to a week; and little did I expect the happy change &s;o &s;hort a period has produced."</P>
<P>"Then you knew, Madam," &s;aid Clara, "how reluctantly I came hither? (Mrs. Mills &s;miled) and Clara rejoined, turning to her father, you &s;hould not have told <HI>that,</HI> papa."</P>
<P>"When we apply to the phy&s;ician, Clara, for advice," returned Mr. Clement, with a &s;mile, "he &s;hould be fully informed of the complaint."</P>
<P>"I was neither &s;urpri&s;ed nor offended, my love," &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "the ideas natural|ly excited by an old Gothic man&s;ion, and a &s;olitary aunt, accorded little with the &s;pright|line&s;s of youth; I wi&s;hed only to convince you, that knowledge and virtue, which give the principal charm to &s;ociety, can al&s;o ren|der the mo&s;t dreary &s;olitude agreeable, and that the rational and contemplative mind will draw to it&s;elf, from objects apparently the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant, a &s;ource of entertain|ment. This being my de&s;ign, I forbore to introduce you to &s;everal neighbouring fami|lies, who&s;e &s;ociety would have enlivened the
<PB N="252" REF="030966_0255_0FEA0EBEABABE2C8">
&s;cene; I re&s;olved, in this vi&s;it, that our plea&s;ures &s;hould re&s;t more immediately upon our&s;elves, and I hope, that the week has pa&s;t neither unplea&s;antly nor unprofitably."</P>
<P>"No, indeed, Madam, &s;aid the young people; the hours have only &s;eemed to fly too fa&s;t; Clara then added, "I had no idea that knowledge could be attained with &s;o much ea&s;e; If I had, I &s;hould not now, be &s;o ignorant."</P>
<P>"Do not deceive your&s;elf, my dear" &s;aid Mrs. Mills; "<HI>time, application,</HI> and <HI>per&s;e|verance,</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary to the attainment of true knowledge: without the&s;e you will ac|quire only that &s;uperficial kind which, by rendering you conceited, will render you contemptible: My de&s;ign, in our conver&s;a|tions this week, has been to awaken in your mind a ta&s;te for rational &s;tudies; 'tis yours to improve it by diligence and per&s;eve|rance."</P>
<P>"Ah, my dear Madam," &s;aid Clara, "had I you to in&s;truct and advi&s;e me! but that cannot be; papa &s;ays we mu&s;t really &s;et off for town to-morrow morning."</P>
<P>"I have been wi&s;hing," &s;aid Mr. Cle|ment, "that it were po&s;&s;ible to purcha&s;e a hou&s;e within a &s;hort ride&mdash;"</P>
<P>"O! that would be delightful," exclaim|ed the young people.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="030966_0256_0FEA0EC249F1CE90">
"I have a better plan," &s;aid Mrs. Mills: "What &s;hould prevent tho&s;e whom intere&s;t and inclination &s;o clo&s;ely unite making one family? This man&s;ion is large enough to contain us all."</P>
<P>"But, my dear &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Mr. Clement, "con&s;ider&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I gue&s;s your &s;cruples," interrupted Mrs. Mills, "and am prepared to an&s;wer them. The obligation &s;hall be mutual: In the &s;ummer you &s;hall be my gue&s;t here, and in the winter I will be yours in Portland Place."</P>
<P>"I am delighted with the propo&s;al," ex|claimed Mr. Clement; "but will you, my dear &s;i&s;ter, who have for years ob&s;tinately &s;ecluded your&s;elf in this retirement, con&s;ent occa&s;ionally to quit it, and mix again with the world?"</P>
<P>"Yes, brother," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "what I have refu&s;ed to the repeated &s;olicitations of my friends, I now offer as a &s;acrifice due to you and to the&s;e dear children: I feel that I can be u&s;eful to you both; my heart expands in the thought, and I no longer he|&s;itate to pur&s;ue the path pointed out to me by new duties."</P>
<P>"How, my dear &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Mr. Clement, "&s;hall I expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e I entertain of your kindne&s;s! how di&s;charge &s;o high an obliga|tion?"</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="030966_0257_0FEA0EC51AA31398">
"There is little merit," &s;aid Mrs. Mills, "in the performance of duties which coin|cide &s;o powerfully with our inclinations."</P>
<P>"And &s;hall we really, madam," &s;aid Cla|ra, "make but one family? What an unex|pected happine&s;s!"</P>
<P>"I too," &s;aid William, "&s;hall &s;hare it with you, &s;i&s;ter, in the holidays."</P>
<P>"It is my intention, William," &s;aid Mr. Clement, "to take you from &s;chool, and to receive a gentleman, with whom I am in treaty, into my family, as tutor to you."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid William, &s;tarting up in an ec&s;tacy, "that indeed will be charming! You &s;hall &s;ee, father, how attentive and di|ligent I will be; I &s;hall be &s;o happy to live at home with you, and my aunt, and my &s;i&s;ter!"</P>
<P>The day pa&s;&s;ed thus in&s;en&s;ibly away, and the next morning, at an early hour, Mr. Clement, with his &s;on and daughter, &s;et out for London: They bade a cheerful farewel to Mrs. Mills, in the full a&s;&s;urance of a &s;peedy return, which took place in the cour&s;e of a few weeks, when having enjoyed the beau|ties of the country, at the clo&s;e of the year, Mr. Clement had the plea&s;ure of conducting his &s;i&s;ter, after an ab&s;ence of more than twelve years, to the metropolis&mdash;From this time the families were united.</P>
<P>Clara, con&s;cious of her imperfections, by diligence and attention, corrected them; &s;he
<PB N="255" REF="030966_0258_0FEA0EC6B8E2DDC0">
became gentle, amiable, and accompli&s;hed; and Mrs. Mills, in whom &s;he ever found an affectionate friend and a faithful coun&s;ellor, had, in time, the happine&s;s of &s;eeing eve|ry female excellence united in her character.&mdash;William too, under a judicious preceptor, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the coun&s;els of his father became a worthy man, and an elegantly accompli&s;h|ed &s;cholar.</P>
<P>Thus William and Clara, by their conduct, con&s;tituted the happine&s;s of a parent and a friend, whom they loved and honored: To the end of their lives, they looked back with plea&s;ure on the week which had taught them the <HI>importance of time;</HI> and convinced them, that it can be no way &s;o well improved as in the <HI>practice of virtue,</HI> and the <HI>acquirement of u&s;eful knowledge.</HI></P>
