<HEAD>THE THREE BROTHERS.</HEAD>
<P>EUGENE, RICHARD, and CASSANDER, were the &s;ons of Mr. Smith&s;on, a reputable mer|chant in the North of Old England, who hav|ing no other children be&s;ides them, and being in pretty affluent circum&s;tances, re&s;olved to have them educated immediately under his own eye. For this purpo&s;e he invited into his hou&s;e a Mr. Markham, a gentleman of learning and approved morals, to be their tutor, who&s;e care and attention to their improvement afterwards fully an&s;wered all his expectations.</P>
<P>The&s;e Three Brothers, from their earlie&s;t in|fancy, were play-mates and companions. They had never been &s;ent out of their father's hou&s;e, either to nur&s;e or even to a &s;chool: as Mrs. Smith&s;on, their mother, who&s;e education ren|dered her perfectly equal to the ta&s;k, under|took to put them through the fir&s;t rudiments of learning, and to prepare them for whatever &s;tudies a tutor might afterwards direct them to. Whether it was their con&s;tant &s;ociety from their earlie&s;t childhood; in the cour&s;e of which, notwith&s;tanding the difference of two years, be|tween
<PB N="6" REF="030803_0005_0FE9654F2404B400">
the age of Ca&s;&s;ander and that of Eugene, each &s;hared invariably in the &s;tudies as well as the amu&s;ements of the other two; or whether it was the natural bent of their di&s;po&s;itions, I know not, but they were remarkable for bear|ing towards each other a degree of affection that is rarely to be found among&s;t brothers in general. In their &s;ports they were in&s;eparable; the inequality of their number was never an ob|&s;tacle to their all partaking of the &s;ame pa&s;time, though it might originally have been intended but for two; and notwith&s;tanding there would now and then ari&s;e a trifling di&s;pute among&s;t them concerning their play, all differences were u&s;ually &s;ettled and reconciled before the con|clu&s;ion of the game, &s;o that they never parted from each other in a pet; but, on the contrary, after they were tired of play, it was no un|common thing to &s;ee them linked all three arm in arm, &s;auntering up and down the gar|den walks, which were commonly the &s;cene of their amu&s;ements; and in that friendly at|titude communicating to each other their little fancies, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the remarkale &s;tories that occurred in the cour&s;e of their le&s;&s;ons, or el&s;e laying their heads together to plan and &s;trike out &s;ome new mode of diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus agreeing, and unanimous in all things, they entered with plea&s;ure upon the cour&s;e of &s;tudy laid down to them by Mr. Markham, their tutor. Mrs. Smith&s;on had never, while her &s;ons were under her care, made their le&s;|&s;ons a painful or di&s;agreeable ta&s;k; the novelty therefore of Mr. Markham's fir&s;t examination, under whom they found that they were to learn
<PB N="7" REF="030803_0006_0FE9655577097270">
both Latin and Greek, &s;o charmed and de|lighted them, that they all three jumped for joy when their Papa &s;howed them three Latin Grammars, which they were to begin the next day.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P>Be&s;ides, their &s;atisfaction at not being o|bliged to leave their dear parents, nor to be &s;e|parated from each other, might not a little <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">|tribute to the alacrity they &s;howed on this oc|ca&s;ion. In effect the quickne&s;s of their pro|gre&s;s &s;urprized and delighted Mr. Markham,
<PB N="8" REF="030803_0007_0FE96558B3D35D50">
their pre&s;ent tutor, as well as their former one, that is their Mama, to whom they would run every day in raptures of joy to communicate the contents of their &s;everal le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have &s;een Eugene, Richard&punc; and Ca&s;&s;ander, perfectly alike and equal in all things; it is nece&s;&s;ary now to &s;how in what re&s;|pects they were unlike, and how the particular character and di&s;po&s;ition of each, though lead|ing to actions extremely different from what the others would pur&s;ue, yet always uniformly concurred in the exertion of that amiable prin|ciple, brotherly love.</P>
<P>Eugene, therefore, with much genero&s;ity and &s;omething of fire in his compo&s;ition, was at the &s;ame time a little arch, or what is called waggi&s;h. His pranks in general were the mo&s;t innocent in the world, it is true, and he could &s;ay at lea&s;t, that he never meant to hurt: if, however, it would &s;ometimes happen, which after all was &s;eldom the ca&s;e, that any of his little jokes co&s;t either of his brothers a tear; that tear, it was ea&s;y to be &s;een, gave Eugene infinitely more pain than any he him&s;elf &s;hed: but the open frankne&s;s and ardent good nature, with which he would con&s;ole his weeping bro|ther, &s;eldom failed to dry it up in a moment. He would never ju&s;tify his own mi&s;takes or his awkwardne&s;s; and thus he &s;eldom felt the re|proaches of his companions, becau&s;e they al|ways found him ready to &s;ubmit to them can|didly, and, whenever it &s;o happened, to own him&s;elf in the fault.</P>
<P>Richard, on the other hand, was all &s;impli|city: he had not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of de&s;ign in
<PB N="9" REF="030803_0008_0FE96560CE1E22C0">
him; and were it not for the extraordinary ap|prehen&s;ion that he &s;howed in his learning, in which he out&s;tripped both his brothers, he might be &s;aid not to have a thought of his own. Thus Richard, though as cheerful as the day, &s;eldom laughed unle&s;s Eugene or Ca&s;&s;ander led the joke. He never propo&s;ed a new &s;ort of play, or invented a fre&s;h plaything, but always was ready, with the greate&s;t good humour, to join in the one and admire the other, if offered to his attention by either of his brothers. He might even be &s;aid to have no wants or likings of his own, but as they put him in mind of them. If Eugene &s;aid to the maid, "Molly, I want to go to bed;" Richard would add, "&s;o do I too." If Ca&s;&s;ander &s;aid, "Mama, pray give me a piece of bread and butter," Richard, if pre&s;ent, would commonly join, "Aye, and me too." And this di&s;po&s;ition of Richard was the happie&s;t in the world; for pre&s;erving the friend|&s;hip of the Three Brothers; &s;ince, whatever advantage or &s;uperiority he might have in his learning, all his amu&s;ements, all the plea&s;ure that he enjoyed from &s;ociety, depended wholly on Eugene and Ca&s;&s;ander.</P>
<P>This la&s;t was neither &s;o volatile as his elder brother, nor &s;o &s;imple as Richard: he had &s;omething grave even in his countenance, and though younge&s;t of the three, was allowed to be much the mo&s;t prudent; by which means he balanced, as it were, the oppo&s;ite defects of his brothers, and frequently would act as their advi&s;er and cen&s;or, by reproving Eugene for his too great vivacity, which led him &s;o often into &s;crapes, and Richard for his thoughtle&s;s ab&s;ence and extreme credulity. But though
<PB N="10" REF="030803_0009_0FE965625509F4B0">
he &s;ometimes took this freedom, it was always with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, being accu&s;tomed from his infancy to treat his elders with re&s;pect, particularly his brothers. Indeed a re&s;pect for their elders and &s;uperiors Mrs. Smith&s;on took early care to inculcate on the minds of all her children. Richard was commanded to yield in every thing to Eugene, and Ca&s;&s;ander to Richard; and all three to behave with proper deference to tho&s;e who were more advanced in life than them&s;elves. This injunction had a good effect more ways than one: it prevented any childi&s;h conte&s;ts for the preference, as each knew and was contented with his own rank, and always waited his proper turn. Be&s;ides, it made them behave with good manners to &s;trangers, let their condition in life be what it will; nor was any one of them ever known to &s;peak or act with petulance even to a beggar.</P>
<P>After remaining a competent time under the in&s;truction of Mr. Markham, it was their fa|ther's plea&s;ure that they &s;hould all three enter the Univer&s;ity together, and pur&s;ue their &s;tudies there, in order to qualify them&s;elves for what|ever of the learned profe&s;&s;ions they might af|terwards choo&s;e. This circum&s;tance gave them infinite plea&s;ure. The love that they bore to each other while children, was now ripening into a &s;teady, ardent friend&s;hip, which no time could alter or dimini&s;h; and they &s;aw before them a pro&s;pect of being happy in each other's &s;ociety during the whole cour&s;e of their lives. But human events are uncertain, and the &s;hades of misfortune often intervene unexpectedly to chequer the mo&s;t equal and placid &s;un&s;hine of
<PB N="11" REF="030803_0010_0FE9656A51CAB000">
pro&s;perity. Mr. Smith&s;on was &s;till in trade, and therefore liable to accidents and cro&s;&s;es which merchants frequently experience. It hap|pened, in the beginning of the war, that two &s;hips, containing property of his to a very con|&s;iderable amount, unin&s;ured, were taken by the enemy. The deficiency produced in his capital by this misfortune, joined to &s;everal other &s;maller lo&s;&s;es, obliged Mr. Smith&s;on to become a bankrupt; after which, conceiving a di&s;ta&s;te to his native place, he determined to take a voyage to the We&s;t Indies, in order to look after an e&s;tate in land which had been be|queathed him as a legacy by &s;ome di&s;tant rela|tion &s;ince the time of his failure. At his de|parture, not judging it expedient to take his wife along with him, he left her a &s;mall &s;um of ready money, but promi&s;ed to &s;end over remit|tances whenever the property, of which he went to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, could be turned to any account.</P>
<P>Our Three Brothers were incon&s;olable at parting with their father: this was the fir&s;t time in their lives that they might be &s;aid to feel the grief of ab&s;ence from their beloved parents; for while at College they could hardly be called ab&s;ent from home, as they conver&s;ed weekly, nay almo&s;t daily, by letters, either with Mr. or Mrs. Smith&s;on. But their &s;orrow was con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed, when, after two years had elap&s;ed without any tidings from their father, they received a melancholy epi&s;tle from Mrs. Smith&s;on, informing them of her utter inability to maintain them any longer at College, and reque&s;ting their immediate return, in order to
<PB N="12" REF="030803_0011_0FE9656BD6E1AA80">
con&s;ult how they &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves for their future &s;ettlement in life.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>During the la&s;t two years that they had &s;pent at the Univer&s;ity, nothing but the &s;trict|e&s;t economy, on the part of the Brothers, as well as that of their indulgent parent, could have enabled them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; yet notwith&s;tand|ing the general di&s;&s;ipation of the place, their temperance and frugality did not hinder them from &s;upporting an amiable character, and be|ing highly e&s;teemed by all who knew them. They were remarked for an obliging, affable demeanour, an unexceptionable attention to their College duties, but particularly for the &s;trict intimacy and happy degree of unanimity which they always appeared to maintain. They were indeed di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of the <HI>Three Brothers;</HI> and the wits of the place &s;poke of them as an exception to that remark of the poet,
<Q><L>Friend&s;hip, like love, is but a name,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s to one you &s;tint the flame.</L></Q>
<PB N="13" REF="030803_0012_0FE96573DF4F4240">
However, there was a con&s;iderable difference in their di&s;po&s;itions, which, without the lea&s;t impairing their affection, grew every day more and more con&s;picuous. Eugene was now am|bitious, enterpri&s;ing, and changeable: his parts were rather brilliant than &s;olid. Ca&s;&s;ander, on the contrary, was &s;teady in his opinions and re|&s;olutions, which he built on the &s;ounde&s;t and mo&s;t mature reflexion: he appeared more &s;low in apprehending the difficulties of &s;cience than his elder brother; but, in return, his memory was more faithful and retentive, and whatever knowledge he once made his own was ever af|ter at his command; for, as Mr. Pope elegant|ly ob&s;erves,
<Q><L>Where beams of warm imagination play,</L>
<L>The memory's &s;oft figures melt away.</L></Q>
Richard was a &s;ort of <HI>medium</HI> between the&s;e oppo&s;ites: with &s;omething of Eugene's viva|city and the &s;teadine&s;s of Ca&s;&s;ander, he had an ardent and in&s;atiable thir&s;t of knowledge; in effect, he had recommended him&s;elf &s;o power|fully to his &s;uperiors, by the extent and &s;plen|dour of his attainments, that he was at this very time of Mrs. Smith&s;on's writing for him and his brothers, pointed out to a nobleman, equally re&s;pectable for his rank and principles, as a proper per&s;on to be private tutor to his Lord&s;hip's two &s;ons, who were lately entered at the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>At their return, therefore, upon the &s;um|mons of their mother, when &s;he laid before them the melancholy &s;tate of their affairs, the di&s;appointment of their expectations, and, to
<PB N="14" REF="030803_0013_0FE9657564D33348">
crown all, the dreadful apprehen&s;ions that &s;he entertained of the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, either at &s;ea or by the ca&s;ualties of war; concluding with the tendere&s;t advice to them, to unite their efforts towards the re-e&s;tabli&s;hing of their circum&s;tances by a &s;teady cour&s;e of indu&s;try in whatever profe&s;&s;ions they might adopt: upon this occa&s;ion it was that the advantages of &s;u|perior application and a more rapid progre&s;s in learning appeared con&s;picuous. While Eugene and Ca&s;&s;ander endeavour to comfort Mrs. Smith&s;on by the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of their future diligence and the exertion of their in|du&s;try in &s;ome line or other that might afford them&s;elves and her a decent maintenance, Richard had the happine&s;s of being able to make his mother and brothers the immediate tender of a &s;mall competency from the &s;alary which his noble patron was to allow him, who only waited for his an&s;wer to inve&s;t him with the care of his children's education. This pro&s;pect was a &s;ea&s;onable relief to Mrs. Smith|&s;on from the de&s;pondency into which the pre|&s;ent gloom of her affairs had thrown her. It is true, the iron hand of want had not as yet be|gun to pinch her and her children, but the near approach of that unwelcome vi&s;itor (with|out &s;uch a re&s;ource as Richard now &s;ugge&s;ted), was &s;ufficient to fill her mind with the mo&s;t melancholy ideas and di&s;mal pre&s;ages of adver|&s;ity and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Now therefore at length, by the irre&s;i&s;tible decree of nece&s;&s;ity, were our Three Brothers obliged to part, and take different walks on the va&s;t theatre of life. Richard, returning to the
<PB N="15" REF="030803_0014_0FE9657D6EBE7228">
Univer&s;ity, attached him&s;elf with &s;o much &s;uc|ce&s;s to the education of his noble pupils, and to his own improvement, that, be&s;ides being able for the pre&s;ent to contribute to the com|forts of his mother, and tho&s;e whom he held mo&s;t dear next to her, he had the pro&s;pect be|fore him of obtaining an ample &s;ettlement in the church, through the intere&s;t of his munifi|cent patron, who&s;e favour he enjoyed in as full a mea&s;ure as his numerous good qualities enti|tled him to it. Eugene, having procured re|commendations to a merchant in London, re|paired thither, and, applying him&s;elf &s;teadily to bu&s;ine&s;s, in the cour&s;e of four years gave &s;uch proofs of his integrity and other good qualifica|tions, that he was taken by the merchant into partner&s;hip. Ca&s;&s;ander, in the mean time, fearing to become a burthen on the moderate pen&s;ion that Richard allowed his mother, em|braced the offer of a Newca&s;tle trader, who, hav|ing formerly been an intimate friend of Mr. Smith&s;on's agreed to take Ca&s;&s;ander a voyage to the Ea&s;t country upon trial. Ca&s;&s;ander was &s;till but young, being no more than &s;ixteen at the time of his entering upon a &s;ea life, and af|ter his voyage of trial he prudently made it his choice, in preference to waiting for the un|certain chance of &s;ome more brilliant e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. In effect, what with the advantage of an excellent education, a patient and humane di&s;po&s;ition, and the uncommon character (for a &s;eaman) of being remarkably &s;ober and fru|gal, he in a very few years &s;o improved him&s;elf in the knowledge of trade and navigation, that he was appointed mate of a ve&s;&s;el trading to
<PB N="16" REF="030803_0015_0FE9657EF507F168">
Ru&s;&s;ia, the owners of which were &s;o well plea&s;|ed with his activity and good conduct, that they were determined, notwith&s;tanding his youth, to &s;end him out ma&s;ter of one of their &s;hips, the fir&s;t opportunity that offered.</P>
<P>Thus, for &s;ome years after the &s;eparation of the Three Brothers, fortune &s;eemed to recom|pen&s;e the &s;evere lo&s;s that they had felt in the per&s;on of their father, concerning whom, all this time, notwith&s;tanding every po&s;&s;ible in|quiry, not the &s;malle&s;t intelligence had been received. But now, alas! once more, &s;orrow and adver&s;ity came hand in hand to di&s;quiet the feeling hearts of our three youths, by an hour of trial &s;uch as they had never yet experienced. The news of their mother's death was the &s;e|vere prelude to their misfortunes. Richard had &s;carcely recovered the &s;hock of this, when the death of his patron totally di&s;&s;ipated all the flattering hopes that he had formed of fortune and preferment in the church, in which he had already taken orders. Eugene, and his partner had for &s;ome time felt their affairs in a critical condition; but this did not hinder him from exerting his native genero&s;ity in the &s;ervice of an ancient friend. Indeed, the voice of friend|&s;hip and gratitude always met with a favoura|ble hearing from Eugene, let their &s;ummons be ever &s;o pre&s;&s;ing and importunate. His old tutor, Mr. Markham, under whom he and his brothers had &s;pent &s;ome of the happie&s;t years of their life, was at this time in London. Di&s;|abled by &s;ickne&s;s and infirmity, advancing fa&s;t towards helple&s;s old age, and &s;orely galled by poverty and the neglect of the world, he was
<PB N="17" REF="030803_0016_0FE96583EE26D1C0">
almo&s;t without a friend. In this cri&s;is, chance threw his generous pupil in his way, who am|ply &s;upplied the place of one to him. Be&s;ides
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
furni&s;hing him with the means of &s;upplying his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities; Eugene, and by his per|&s;ua&s;ion his partner, became &s;ecurity for the payment of a very con&s;iderable debt, which was on the point of con&s;igning Mr. Markham to a gaol, where he might probably have pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of his life. But how ill did for|tune requite Eugene for this friendly action! Mr. Markham died in le&s;s than three months after, when of cour&s;e the debt devolved upon tho&s;e who had given &s;ecurity for him. Imme|diately upon the heels of this misfortune follow|ed another. The affairs of Eugene's partner&s;hip growing de&s;perate, they were obliged to declare them&s;elves bankrupt, and this very kindne&s;s which he &s;howed Mr. Markham, was reckoned
<PB N="18" REF="030803_0017_0FE965872E7A9EE0">
among the misfortunes that contributed to his ruin. The &s;hock that Eugene's &s;pirits &s;uffered upon this occa&s;ion, as he found him&s;elf now un|able to fulfil engagements which he looked up|on as &s;acred, drove him from one act of ra&s;h|ne&s;s and de&s;pair to another; till in the end, re|duced to extremity of want, in an ob&s;cure coun|try place; he madly and precipitately threw him&s;elf among a company of travelling players, and, to crown all, in this unpromi&s;ing &s;tate of life, being barely able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t him&s;elf, he had the de&s;perate imprudence to marry. It &s;eems he had formed a &s;light acquaintance with a young lady (the daughter of a clergyman), who was &s;o &s;truck with his figure and accompli&s;hments, that &s;he yielded to his &s;olicitations to be united with him in the ties of clande&s;tine wedlock; thereby utterly forfeiting all her expectations of fortune, together with the friend&s;hip of eve|ry one of her relations. The con&s;equence of this unadvi&s;ed &s;tep, which brought poverty and her train into Eugene's habitation in &s;hapes unknown before, he bore with as much forti|tude and philo&s;ophy as u&s;ually falls to the &s;hare of five and twenty, that is, with very little if any at all. Some time before this, Ca&s;&s;ander, who had made two or three voyages for his north-country owners, was invited to London by his brother and his partner, to take the command of one of the large &s;hips in which they were principal proprietors. Overjoyed at this invitation, which would give him an op|portunity, or rather indeed lay him under the nece&s;&s;ity, of being frequently with his brother while on &s;hore, he came to town with all &s;peed&punc;
<PB N="19" REF="030803_0018_0FE9658F8F503E08">
and was ju&s;t time enough to be witne&s;s to the unfortunate failure of Eugene and his a&s;&s;ociate in trade.</P>
<P>Thus were the Three Brothers plunged into circum&s;tances of the mo&s;t helple&s;s di&s;tre&s;s, ju&s;t at a time when they entertained hopes (appa|rently well founded) of fixing them&s;elves to their &s;atisfaction for life in their re&s;pective pro|fe&s;&s;ions. Had any one of them been exempt from the pre&s;&s;ure of misfortune, the other two would have been &s;ure of partaking with him in the comforts that depend on a competency of wealth. But all three were equally reduced; and the only remnant of happine&s;s, that they could call their own, was the &s;en&s;e of their mu|tual affection, which &s;till continued unalter|able, amid&s;t the mo&s;t pinching trials of di&s;ap|pointment and calamity. In this &s;ituation were the Smith&s;ons, when an incident happened which put that affection to the proof, and brought forth in&s;tances of &s;elf-denial and gene|ro&s;ity that well de&s;erve to be recorded. In the cour&s;e of Eugene's wanderings as a country player, fortune conducted him to Grave&s;end where, as he was exhibiting before an audience, chiefly compo&s;ed of &s;eafaring people, the &s;ame fortune unaccountably led his father to become a &s;pectator of his performance. In order to ex|plain the &s;udden appearance of Mr. Smith&s;on, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to relate what befel him af|ter his departure from England. The reader will remember that this gentleman had &s;et &s;ail for the We&s;t-Indies, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate in one of the i&s;lands there; but, having pretty early intelligence that the enemy
<PB N="20" REF="030803_0019_0FE96592CBEB6058">
were ma&s;ters of the i&s;land, and therefore ap|prehending numberle&s;s ob&s;tacles to his obtain|ing clear and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate; he formed the immediate re&s;olution of getting out, if po&s;&s;ible, to the Ea&s;t Indies, where he tru&s;ted that, by his general knowledge of trade, he &s;hould in a &s;hort time be able to retrieve his &s;hattered circum&s;tances, and to return to his native country with a fortune &s;ufficient to ren|der the remaining years of his life ea&s;y and com|fortable. At the &s;ame time he took another re|&s;olution (the &s;ource of infinite grief and di&s;|quiet to his family), which was, never to in|form them of the place of his retirement until he had gained wealth &s;ufficient to relea&s;e them from the &s;tate of indigence and ob&s;curity into which, he was pur&s;uaded, his ab&s;ence mu&s;t have plunged them. This object he amply accom|pli&s;hed in ten years, during all which time his family con&s;idered him as dead; and at the end of that period he was now returning to &s;hare his riches with tho&s;e whom he held mo&s;t dear; when the fir&s;t &s;ight that &s;aluted his eyes after he went on &s;hore was his unfortunate &s;on figuring in the humble profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;troller. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the rage, &s;orrow, and di&s;appoint|ment, which at once took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Smith&s;on's brea&s;t, when he was at length con|vinced that his eyes and ears did not deceive him. He &s;uddenly left the theatre, or rather barn, before the play was half over, and tak|ing no farther notice of his &s;on than to leave a note directed for him, and filled with the bit|tere&s;t reproaches, he hurried on board the &s;hip. Upon his arrival in London, finding his anxi|ous
<PB N="21" REF="030803_0020_0FE96597F4BBF830">
wi&s;hes and all the projects of his affection di&s;concerted by his elde&s;t &s;on's imprudence; his next care was to make inquiry about Richard and Ca&s;&s;ander; for his wife's death he had been informed of by mere accident a &s;hort time be|fore he left India. Richard he &s;oon found out, who, upon the fir&s;t &s;ummons, flew to embrace his long lo&s;t parent. Mr. Smith&s;on, after brief|ly relating to him the circum&s;tances of his voy|age to and &s;ucce&s;s in the Ea&s;t Indies, began, bitterly to lament his misfortune in having a &s;on &s;o abandoned to modefy and di&s;cretion, as he &s;tyled the unfortunate Eugene. He added, that the bulk of the fortune which he had realized abroad, he intended now to divide between his two younger &s;ons, the elder having proved him|&s;elf &s;o unworthy of his favour: that he did not mean to keep them in expectation until his death, but would put each of them in imme|diate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an ample fortune; re&s;erving for him&s;elf what he was determined &s;hould be &s;ufficient for his nece&s;&s;ities during the remain|der of his life. He concluded with in&s;i&s;ting, that whatever he meant thus to di&s;po&s;e in favour of his younger &s;ons, he would take care to &s;ee &s;ettled in &s;uch a manner, that neither Eugene nor his po&s;terity &s;hould ever inherit a penny of it.</P>
<P>Richard mode&s;tly thanked his father for the affectionate care that he te&s;tified for his intere&s;t, but tenderly intreated him not to form too pre|cipitate a re&s;olution to the prejudice of his elde&s;t born. He u&s;ed many arguments to excu&s;e, or at lea&s;t to palliate Eugene's indi&s;cretion; repre|&s;ented the &s;orrowful effects that a continuance
<PB N="22" REF="030803_0021_0FE9659B3A6DB7C8">
of his father's re&s;entment might have upon a mind &s;o exqui&s;itely feeling as his; and ended with the&s;e words: "As to what regards my own per&s;onal advantage, I a&s;&s;ure you Sir, I feel my&s;elf naturally very indifferent; and were I not &s;o by nature, the profe&s;&s;ion that I have em|braced, the precepts of which I have with my whole heart con&s;ented to obey, that profe&s;&s;ion commands me to fix my thoughts and expect|ations upon matters of a far different nature. Be&s;ides, had I the mo&s;t worldly regard for my own intere&s;t, the affection that I have ever borne, and &s;till bear to my brother Eugene, would &s;tand as a bar to my accepting any fortune to which he had the mo&s;t di&s;tant claim, I am not with|out hopes, my dear father, that when your pre|&s;ent anger &s;ub&s;ides, you will once more look upon him with the tenderne&s;s of a parent, in which ca&s;e you will, I tru&s;t, applaud the prin|ciple that induces me to decline your liberal offer." Mr. Smith&s;on, with a&s;toni&s;hment in his countenance, a&s;ked his &s;on if he was &s;erious in refu&s;ing &s;o hand&s;ome a fortune; and finding him fixed in the determination that he had be|fore expre&s;&s;ed, he ro&s;e up with evident marks of vexation and di&s;appointment; and ca&s;ting &s;ome uncharitable reflexions on the de&s;tiny which, he &s;aid, pur&s;ued him through life, baffling and fru&s;trating the mo&s;t favourite and even lauda|ble wi&s;hes of his heart, he added in a tone of voice, &s;omewhat &s;oftened, "Little did I expect, when I &s;ent for you, to find you an abettor of that profligacy which has alienated my heart from your elder brother. I fondly thought that my children would pay &s;uch deference to my
<PB N="23" REF="030803_0022_0FE965A3F4A416E8">
authority as even to adopt my prejudices; but &s;ince you have determined to think for your|&s;elf, be your own ma&s;ter. Thank Heaven, I have yet one &s;on left." Richard endeavoured in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, to repre&s;ent the motives of his conduct, but perceiving that whatever he &s;aid only tended to irritate his fa|ther, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible, for the pre|&s;ent, to obtain a calm hearing, he reluctantly withdrew, leaving his father in a &s;ituation not to be envied by a parent.</P>
<P>Nothing could arrive more opportunely to relieve the depre&s;&s;ion of Mr. Smith&s;on's &s;pirits, than the news that he heard next morning; which was, that a &s;hip, in which Ca&s;&s;ander had gone out in the capacity of a mate, after the failure of Eugene, was returned from her voy|age in the river. His re&s;entment was now not only pointed at Eugene for his indi&s;cretion, but at Richard for his too &s;crupulous, uncomply|ing principles. He was therefore determined to be&s;tow his whole fortune upon Ca&s;&s;ander. But what language can expre&s;s the amazement of Mr. Smith&s;on, when, upon his propo&s;ing to do &s;o, the generous &s;eaman, without the lea&s;t he|&s;itation or preamble, flatly refu&s;ed to accept a penny of it! He thought, however, that re|&s;pect to his father required him to give the rea&s;ons on which he grounded his refu&s;al. He did &s;o, and with arguments nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e u&s;ed by his brother Richard, he endea|voured to convince his father that pa&s;&s;ion had a much greater &s;hare than mature deliberation in the &s;entence which he was going to pa&s;s upon his elde&s;t &s;on: "We are all liable to go a|&s;tray,"
<PB N="24" REF="030803_0023_0FE965A733711910">
&s;aid Ca&s;&s;ander: "happy is he who has the fewe&s;t faults. If we do not forgive tho&s;e of a &s;on, or a brother, Heaven help us when our own come to be judged! As for me, I have lived contented with a little, and am not un|acquainted with hard&s;hip and di&s;tre&s;s. God for|bid, therefore, that I &s;hould gra&s;p at my bro|ther's birth right.&mdash;But I declare, were Eugene no brother of mine, knowing as I do his gene|rous nature and the warmth of his hone&s;t heart, I would go before the ma&s;t all my life long, &s;ooner than accept, to his prejudice, a property which nature and rea&s;on &s;o clearly adjudge to him."</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o ingenuous in this addre&s;s of Ca&s;&s;ander's, &s;omething that &s;poke &s;o feelingly to his father's brea&s;t, that, in &s;pite of a &s;hort conflict which re&s;entment endeavoured to excite there, he found him&s;elf con&s;trained to yield the point, and while he wiped away a tear, the offspring of returning tenderne&s;s and affection, he took his &s;on by the hand: "Ca&s;|&s;ander," &s;aid he, &s;miling, "thou ha&s;t con|quered. Surely there mu&s;t be &s;omething of extraordinary merit in Eugene, &s;ince he has found two &s;o re&s;olute advocates in his favour as you and your brother Richard.&mdash;Well, I for|give all the pa&s;t&mdash;it &s;hall be buried in oblivi|on.&mdash;Convince me, as I doubt not you will, that my elde&s;t &s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es qualities worthy to excite &s;uch &s;entimnets as you have both expre&s;&s;|ed in his favour, and I &s;hall be happy indeed."</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to add, that the joy produced by this favourable change in Mr. Smith&s;on's feelings was &s;oon diffu&s;ed in the brea&s;ts of his
<PB N="25" REF="030803_0024_0FE965AC0959FB60">
two di&s;con&s;olate &s;ons. Eugene, upon the re|ceipt of his father's note, had hurried up to town from Grave&s;end, like one di&s;tracted, and was now at Richard's lodgings, indulging the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate effu&s;ions of grief and de&s;pair; while Richard, depre&s;&s;ed with a load of &s;orrows, &s;at moping in &s;ilence, without a word of comfort to offer to his brother. They hardly perceived Ca&s;&s;ander enter the room; but when he met their eyes, they &s;tarted as at the &s;ight of an an|gel. Something prophetic whi&s;pered comfort to their minds even before he &s;poke. But how

full was the mea&s;ure of their joy when he an|nounced to them his father's invitation to repair immediately to his pre&s;ence! The &s;equel is ea|&s;y to be imagined: all was reconciled: the pa&s;t was forgotten, and the future opened a pro&s;pect of happine&s;s before them more &s;miling than they had ever enjoyed before.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="030803_0025_0FE965AFB3E80278">Thus the Brothers, by the efforts of their mutual affection, increa&s;ed the happine&s;s that pro&s;perity afforded them, &s;u&s;tained each other under the pre&s;&s;ure of misfortune, and, by per|&s;evering in unalterable friend&s;hip to each other, at length en&s;ured both their own happine&s;s and that of their deare&s;t and fir&s;t friend on earth&mdash;their Father.</P>

<HEAD>THE THREE SISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>NOT many years ago there returned from Bengal a man whom we will call John Sterling: he had been well educated, was &s;prung from a decent family, and brought home the &s;ame good heart which he carried out with him from Britain. As his fortune was now very large, and he had formed no matrimonial connexions, his fir&s;t care, on his arriving in his native land, was to di&s;cover what relations he had &s;till re|maining, and to inquire into their circum|&s;tances, in order to be&s;tow on the mo&s;t de&s;erv|ing of them, part of his great acqui&s;itions. It chanced that the per&s;on to whom he applied, was able to a&s;&s;i&s;t in his &s;earch. "Some at lea&s;t," &s;aid he, "of your family, I can give you a pretty good account of: you have two cou|&s;ins
<PB N="27" REF="030803_0026_0FE965B992E791B0">
&s;ettled in London; they are &s;i&s;ters, and are by no means in di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, but are perfect contra&s;ts to each other in their man|ner of living. The elde&s;t of them is avarici|ous to an extreme, lives in a paltry lodging, keeps but one maid &s;ervant, and in &s;hort &s;eems to have no plea&s;ure on earth, except that of heaping up money. Not &s;o her younger &s;i&s;ter; &s;he takes care to &s;pend to the very extremity of her income. She takes great delight in dre&s;s, equipage, and every &s;pecie of luxury, but her expences of the &s;howy kind never prevent the exertions of her humanity: there pa&s;&s;es no week in which &s;he does not di&s;tribute, on an ap|pointed day, money, cloaths, and victuals to a number of beggars, who crowd around her door to be relieved." "This la&s;t cou&s;in of mine," &s;aid our Indian, "I like well enough, by your account; but as to the other, not a penny of mine &s;hall &s;he have, to add to her heaps, an old avaricious &s;kin-flint!"</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments, John Sterling &s;et out to vi&s;it his younge&s;t relation. From her he met with a polite and ho&s;pitable reception, and de|parted from her hou&s;e in a perfect good humour with her and her manner of living.</P>
<P>It happened that the only maid &s;ervant who lived with the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, was acquainted in the family of the per&s;on from whom Sterling had received his intelligence concerning the characters of the two &s;i&s;ters. Some of the do|me&s;tics had overheard the conver&s;ation, and took the fir&s;t opportunity to reproach the girl for the par&s;imony of her mi&s;tre&s;s, which they told her had lo&s;t her the &s;haring of a fine &s;um of
<PB N="28" REF="030803_0027_0FE965BB193DC6D8">
money. This &s;oon reached the ears of the fe|male mi&s;er, who&s;e vexation, at hearing what &s;he had mi&s;&s;ed, was almo&s;t in&s;upportable. The large fortune, which by dint of the mo&s;t penu|rious economy &s;he had &s;craped together, now appeared to her le&s;s than nothing, when &s;he con&s;idered the immen&s;e trea&s;ures of her cou&s;in, all of which &s;he thought might have been her own, had &s;he but managed &s;o as to gain the good graces of the owner. "Perhaps," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "it may not, even now, be too late to retrieve my error. Some of my money I mu&s;t &s;acrifice, it is true, but then if I &s;ucceed, I &s;hall be nobly reimbur&s;ed. It will go to my heart, indeed, to part with what has been the whole joy of my life to procure, but I &s;ee no other chance in my favour, and this &s;cheme mu&s;t be tried." Having taken her re&s;olution, &s;he determined, as the fir&s;t &s;tep, to contrive to fall into company with her opulent relation. This &s;he &s;oon brought about, by meeting him at her &s;i&s;ter's, where he was almo&s;t always to be found. She now endeavoured, by every win|ing grace in her power to captivate his atten|tion, and when &s;he thought &s;he had in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded, &s;he took an opportunity to reproach him for appearing to have forgotten that he had &s;uch a relation as her&s;elf. "No, Madam," &s;aid the blunt Sterling, "I had by no means forgotten you, but the plain truth is, that finding on inquiry, that your turn and mine were as widely different as light and dark|ne&s;s, I thought that no good could ari&s;e from any connexion between us." "I comprehend you, Sir," (replied the lady,) you have heard
<PB N="29" REF="030803_0028_0FE965C1923DD490">
me repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t odious colours, as a pattern of meanne&s;s and avarice. How cruel is the tongue of defamation! I have laid up mo|ney, it is true, but Heaven knows with what intent! The &s;ervice of my indigent fellow-crea|tures has been my real motive, and it was only to ama&s;s a &s;um &s;ufficient to lay the foundation of a new Ho&s;pital, that I have deprived my&s;elf of not only the <HI>&s;uperfluities,</HI> but almo&s;t of the <HI>nece&s;&s;aries</HI> of life. At length I have attained to my wi&s;h, and to-morrow I intend to depo&s;it, in the hands of proper tru&s;tees, five hundred guineas, which I mean to be laid out in the purcha&s;e of land for the edifice to &s;tand upon." The hone&s;t Indian was completely taken in by this manoeuvre. "How unju&s;tly," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "have I thought of this poor woman! Here has &s;he denied her&s;elf every gratification for the &s;ake of the poor, and I have looked on her as a &s;elf-intere&s;ted mi&s;er! Well, well, I mu&s;t contrive to make her amends." Then turning to the lady, "Madam," &s;aid he, "hither|to I have mi&s;taken your character, but I now honour you as much as a few hours pa&s;t I de&s;|pi&s;ed you. But you mu&s;t not prevent me from &s;haring with you the merit of the noble work which you have taken in hand; to-morrow I will attend upon you, and will add my part to the do|nation which you are about to make." He kept his word, and accompanied her the next morn|ing: he then &s;aw her make a depo&s;it of the &s;um which &s;he had mentioned, to which he joined a much more con&s;iderable pre&s;ent for the &s;ame charitable purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The worthy Sterling was recounting the ad|ventures
<PB N="30" REF="030803_0029_0FE965C4D1C51E38">
of the day to his friend, and was tell|ing him how very unju&s;tly he had thought of the elder of his cou&s;ins, when he was told that an old dome&s;tic of the family earne&s;tly entreat|ed to &s;peak with him. "Perhaps," &s;aid the good Ea&s;t Indian, "he may need my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; let him come in." The poor fellow entered. "Can I, my good friend, be of any &s;ervice to you?" &s;aid Sterling. "I am very unfortunate," &s;aid the &s;uppliant, "and it is only the report which I have heard of your goodne&s;s, which has tempted me to this application. I lived twenty years in the &s;ervice of your worthy un|cle: I married, and when I lo&s;t my good ma&s;|ter, I &s;et up a little &s;hop: when I was going on with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s, I was utterly ruined by an unfortunate fire, which con&s;umed my whole &s;tock. Since that cruel event I have been unable to provide for my young and nu|merous family, and I now pre&s;ume to hope that your goodne&s;s will enable me to put my poor children into &s;ome way of bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>"But why, in the name of wonder, did you not apply to my two cou&s;ins!" "Alas, good Sir, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to them in the begin|ing of my misfortunes; but from the elde&s;t I met with a po&s;itive refu&s;al; and the other lady, though &s;he offered me &s;ome relief, yet &s;he ac|companied that offer with the condition of my coming publicly along with other poor, to re|ceive charity at her door; and indeed, Sir, it appeared hard to one who had been a reputable, trade&s;man, to be reduced to beg his bread at a door in a public &s;treet. No Sir, I rather cho&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="030803_0030_0FE965C9C93BD0B8">
to get into a &s;ervice, which I fortunately con|trived to do."</P>
<P>"And what my good friend became then of your children?"</P>
<P>"My elde&s;t daughter, Sir, has had the hap|pine&s;s of being protected by your Honour's cou&s;in, Madam Sophia, who is goodne&s;s it&s;elf, and who, although in very narrow circum&s;tan|ces, yet finds opportunities of doing a thou&s;and good actions."</P>
<P>"How?" &s;aid the good Sterling, "and have I another cou&s;in? And is &s;he poor, and yet is &s;he charitable? And have I, like a blockhead as I am, been ignorant of her very exi&s;tence?"</P>
<P>"There is &s;uch a one, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir; &s;he is the daughter of your uncle, and young|e&s;t of the three &s;i&s;ters."</P>
<P>"Is this po&s;&s;ible?" &s;aid the Ea&s;t Indian, "and if &s;o, how comes it about that neither of her &s;i&s;ters have mentioned her name to me? Where has &s;he lived? How came &s;he &s;o poor?"</P>
<P>"The good lady, Sir, tru&s;ted her fortune in the hands of a merchant who became a bank|rupt, and lo&s;t nearly the whole of it. She then retired, with what little &s;he had remaining, to a village in the country, where &s;he boarded at the hou&s;e of a friend of her's who married a clergyman. There, from her &s;mall income, &s;he found means to be of infinite &s;ervice to her poor neighbours; &s;he vi&s;ited the &s;ick, &s;he in|&s;tructed the young, and by her example and advice, &s;he reclaimed the idle, and encouraged the worthy members of &s;ociety. As to her name not being mentioned to you by her &s;i&s;|ters, I fear their motive for keeping you in ig|norance
<PB N="32" REF="030803_0031_0FE965CED67C35D8">
concerning her, was their con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of her &s;uperior claim to your favour and protection."</P>
<P>"This," cried Sterling, "is the exact per|&s;on that I am looking for. Come, my lad, get your boots ready, to-morrow you &s;hall be my guide to the village where this precious cou&s;in of mine re&s;ides; trouble your&s;elf no more about your children; they &s;hall hence forward be <HI>my</HI> care: and as to your&s;elf, quit your &s;ervice as &s;oon as you can with decency; you are too old to wear a livery, I will provide for you com|fortably for the re&s;t of your life."</P>
<P>"Oh, Sir," &s;aid the old &s;ervant, "be a&s;&s;ured that what is left of that life &s;hall be employed in praying for ble&s;&s;ings on you, and on my kind benefactre&s;s Madam Sophia."</P>
<P>Sterling &s;oon reached the village. He alight|ed at the par&s;onage, and inquired of the mini&s;|ter concerning his amiable cou&s;in. "She is an angel," &s;aid the prie&s;t; "notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s of her fortune, her countenance expre&s;&s;es the happy tranquillity of her mind. Nothing, in &s;hort, can deprive her of her benevolence, and that benevolence mu&s;t always in&s;ure her tranquillity." "Tell her, I entreat you, Sir," &s;aid Sterling, "that a relation, whom &s;he has never &s;een, begs to be introduced to her." So|phia received her cou&s;in with unaffected regard and natural politene&s;s. "I am enchanted with you, my &s;weet cou&s;in!" &s;aid the Ea&s;t Indian. "In your mode&s;t, neat, linen gown, you look more like a woman of fa&s;hion than your &s;howy &s;i&s;ter in her gaye&s;t dre&s;&s;es; and poor as you are, your features are illuminated by an air of con|tent
<PB N="33" REF="030803_0032_0FE965D539EBE950">
which never appears on the vi&s;age of that other &s;i&s;ter of yours; that rich lady that founds ho&s;pitals! But tell me now, hone&s;tly, cou&s;in Sophy, how has it happened that neither of my cou&s;ins ever made mention of your name to me &s;ince my arrival? Have you fallen out with them? Or do they not know where you re&s;ide?"</P>
<P>"Believe me, Sir," replied Sophia, "I love them both too well to keep them in ignorance of my place of abode, and within the&s;e la&s;t three days I have written to each of them" "Hard-hearted wretches!" exclaimed the good Sterling; "can I ever forget their indifference to &s;o amiable a relation?" "Excu&s;e them this one time," &s;aid the gentle Sophia; "I doubt not but that they meant to have made me amends for this omi&s;&s;ion, by the future kind|ne&s;s of their behaviour." "No, no," &s;aid her cou&s;in, "I know the vilene&s;s of their hearts. They were con&s;cious of your &s;uperior merit, and dreaded, le&s;t I &s;hould reward it by be&s;tow|ing on you that fortune which each of them al|ready gra&s;ped as her own: but their odious cunning and greedine&s;s &s;hall be di&s;appointed. To your o&s;tentatious &s;i&s;ter I will not give one farthing; &s;he does good, indeed, but it is merely for the &s;ake of being talked of abroad as a woman of unbounded charity. Your pe|nurious &s;i&s;ter I am &s;till le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to encou|rage. The donation which &s;he has made in fa|vour of the poor, has her own intere&s;t &s;o im|mediately in view, that it gives me infinitely more <HI>di&s;gu&s;t</HI> than <HI>plea&s;ure.

<HEAD>THE CONTRAST.</HEAD>
<P>FREDERIC was the &s;on of a lady of fortune, who, having retired to her e&s;tate in the coun|try, be&s;towed mo&s;t of her time on his educa|tion. In return for her attachment to him, Frederic was mode&s;t, &s;tudious, and humane; he felt the obligations which he was under to his parent, and did his be&s;t to requite them by pur&s;uing her in&s;tructions with care, and by preferring her company to that of any other per&s;on. Jacob, a lad of the &s;ame age with Fre|deric, and who&s;e mother's cottage &s;tood near the park-pale of the lady we have ju&s;t &s;poken of, was in every re&s;pect of a character directly oppo&s;ite to that of his amiable neighbour. He
<PB N="35" REF="030803_0034_0FE965DED1D3B880">
was loved by no one, not even by his poor mo|ther, all who&s;e endeavours could never prevail on him even to take the pains of learning to read. The mo&s;t innocent way in which he &s;pent his time was in loitering from place to place, and lounging about; at other &s;ea&s;ons he was the plague of his comrades, and, in con&s;equence, the dete&s;tation of the village. Frederic was too well bred up to choo&s;e &s;o vile a boy for a play-fellow; Jacob, however, taking advan|tage of the opportunities which the &s;ituation of his mother's tenement gave him, &s;tole, one day, into the room where Frederic's playthings were kept, broke to pieces his violin and his chariot, completely &s;poilt his bird organ, and carried off in triumph his hobby-hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The author of this mi&s;chief was &s;oon di&s;|covered, and Frederic, in the fir&s;t emotions of re&s;entment, was running, by the advice of a &s;er|vant, to acquaint the mother of Jacob with the exploits of her &s;on. "But, no," &s;aid he checking his &s;peed, "&s;he is a &s;evere woman, and &s;he will hor&s;ewhip him without mercy, and, may be, &s;hut him up in an out-hou&s;e for a week together. How &s;hould I like that for my&s;elf? No, no, I had better forgive him, for this once."</P>
<P>Not long after this, Frederic was walking out with his beloved mother, when unluckily they &s;trolled near a place where the thoughtle&s;s, wicked Jacob was amu&s;ing him&s;elf by throwing &s;tones with all his little force at every object within his reach, totally regardle&s;s of the mi&s;|chief which he might occa&s;ion. One of the&s;e unluckily hit the little Frederic on the head,
<PB N="36" REF="030803_0035_0FE965E20EFFAD08">
and fetched the blood; but Frederic was too much of a man to cry at a little pain.&mdash;"Ma|ma," &s;aid the &s;pirited lad, "this &s;tone has hurt me a little, but I dare &s;ay the pain will &s;oon be over." As his forehead, however, was all covered with blood, his mother went directly home with him and had every proper care taken of his wound. It was an ugly one, and brought on a fever, and it was the end of &s;even or eight days before he was permitted to walk out, and his mother being engaged with company, ordered a &s;ervant to accompany him. As they were walking, the di&s;cour&s;e turned on the wickedne&s;s of Jacob; and ju&s;t as the do|me&s;tic was hopeing that they might &s;ee nothing of him during their walk, they heard a ru&s;tling noi&s;e in a tree behind them, and down, at once, came Jacob, &s;creaming and crying, from the top of an elm, which his u&s;ual &s;pirit of mi&s;chief had tempted him to climb in pur&s;uit of a crow's ne&s;t. "I fear," &s;aid Frederic, exerting his ut|mo&s;t endeavours to rai&s;e the poor wretch, "that you have hurt your&s;elf &s;adly." Jacob &s;till con|tinued his groans and cries; and well he might, for, upon examination, his leg appeared to be, broken in two places. "Poor fellow," &s;aid the benevolent Frederic, "how he mu&s;t &s;uffer! let us contrive &s;ome how or other, to convey him home to his mother.&mdash;Unhappy woman! what di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t &s;he not feel when &s;he &s;ees the condition of her unlucky &s;on!" Her di&s;tre&s;s was great indeed. "Poor as I am," &s;he ex|claimed, "I can ju&s;t &s;upport my&s;elf and this ungracious lad; but how &s;hall I ever be able to pay the long demand which the &s;urgeon will
<PB N="37" REF="030803_0036_0FE965E86A59C430">
have upon me, by the time that Jacob reco|vers." Little Frederic, who was a witne&s;s to her complaints, afforded to them tho&s;e tears which his own &s;uffering could never extort from him.&mdash;"Make your&s;elf ea&s;y, my good neigh|bour," &s;aid the amiable boy, "and oblige me &s;o far as to accept this new crown-piece, which my good Mama has ju&s;t given me, that I might buy me a fairing, but I can do without it bet|ter than <HI>you</HI> can." The afflicted mother looked at him with &s;ilent admiration. Frederic pro|ceeded to a&s;&s;ure her, that he was con&s;cious of the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;um, (though it was his all) he would u&s;e his intere&s;t with his parent for a larger &s;upply, and did not doubt to obtain it. The unfortunate woman now found her tongue, and expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t affecting terms, her a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;eeing his earne&s;tne&s;s in reliev|ing that worthle&s;s lad, by who&s;e mi&s;chievous hand his forehead was <HI>&s;till</HI> &s;marting. "This," &s;aid &s;he, "is <HI>truly</HI> to return good for evil!" Frederic now returned to his mother, and after giving her the hi&s;tory of the whole occurrence, "How comes it, Mama," &s;aid he, "that al|though I was truly &s;orry for poor Jacob's mi&s;|fortune; and though I feel both for him and his mother, yet, on the whole, I am more <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> than <HI>grieved?</HI>" "Child," &s;aid the lady, "you have had an opportunity of doing well, and you have made u&s;e of it; and, believe me, throughout life you will find, that the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done a benevolent action will be the mo&s;t effectual cordial for every painful &s;en&s;ation."</P>

<L>"I am a linen-draper bold,</L>

<L>Quoth Mrs. Gilpin&mdash;"That's well &s;aid;</L>
<L>"And, for that wine is dear,</L>
<L>"We will be furni&s;h'd with our own,</L>
<L>"Which is both bright and clear."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin ki&s;s'd his loving wife;</L>
<L>O'erjoy'd was he to find,</L>
<L>That, though on plea&s;ure &s;he was bent,</L>
<L>She had a frugal mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morning came, the chai&s;e was brought,</L>
<L>But yet was not allow'd</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="41" REF="030803_0040_0FE965FD6C0D05F8">
<L>So three doors off the chai&s;e was &s;taid,</L>
<L>Where they did all get in,</L>
<L>Six precious &s;ouls, and all agog</L>
<L>To da&s;h through thick and thin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,</L>
<L>Were never folks &s;o glad;</L>
<L>The &s;tones did rattle underneath,</L>
<L>As if Cheap&s;ide were mad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin, at his hor&s;e's &s;ide,</L>
<L>Seiz'd fa&s;t the flowing mane,</L>
<L>And up he got, in ha&s;te to ride,</L>
<L>But &s;oon came down again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For &s;addle-tree &s;carce reach'd had he,</L>
<L>His journey to begin,</L>
<L>When, turning round his head, he &s;aw</L>
<L>Three cu&s;tomers come in.</L>

<L>So down he came; for lo&s;s of time,</L>
<L>Although it griev'd him &s;ore,</L>
<L>Yet lo&s;s of pence, full well he knew,</L>
<L>Would trouble him much more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas long before the cu&s;tomers</L>
<L>Were &s;uited to their mind,</L>
<L>When Betty, &s;creaming, came down &s;tairs,</L>
<L>"The wine is left behind!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Good lack!" quoth he&mdash;"yet bring it me,</L>
<L>"My leathern belt likewi&s;e,</L>

<L>Now Mrs. Gilpin&mdash;careful &s;oul&mdash;</L>
<L>Had two &s;tone bottles found,</L>
<L>To hold the liquor that &s;he lov'd,</L>
<L>And keep it &s;afe and &s;ound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each bottle had a curling ear,</L>
<L>Through which the belt he drew,</L>
<L>And hung a bottle on each &s;ide,</L>
<L>To make his balance true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then over all, that he might be</L>
<L>Equipp'd from top to toe,</L>
<L>His long red cloak, well bru&s;h'd and neat,</L>
<L>He manfully did throw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now &s;ee him mounted once again</L>
<L>Upon his nimble &s;teed,</L>
<L>Full &s;lowly pacing o'er the &s;tones,</L>
<L>With caution and good heed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But finding &s;oon a &s;moother road</L>
<L>Beneath his well-&s;hod feet,</L>
<L>The &s;norting bea&s;t began to trot,</L>
<L>Which gall'd him in his &s;eat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So, "Fair and &s;oftly," John he cried,</L>
<L>But John he cried in vain;</L>
<L>That trot became a gallop &s;oon,</L>
<L>In &s;pite of curb and rein.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So &s;tooping down, as needs he mu&s;t</L>
<L>Who cannot &s;it upright,</L>
<L>He gra&s;p'd the mane with both his hands,</L>
<L>And eke with all his might.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="43" REF="030803_0042_0FE966074D487B70">
<L>His hor&s;e, who never in that &s;ort</L>
<L>Had handled been before,</L>
<L>What thing upon his back had got</L>
<L>Did wonder more and more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin, neck or nought,</L>
<L>Away went hat and wig;</L>
<L>He little dreamt when he &s;et out,</L>
<L>Of running &s;uch a rig.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,</L>
<L>Like &s;treamer long and gay,</L>
<L>Till loop and button failing both,</L>
<L>At la&s;t it flew away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then might all people well di&s;cern</L>
<L>The bottles he had &s;lung;</L>
<L>A bottle &s;winging at each &s;ide,</L>
<L>As hath been &s;aid or &s;ung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dogs did bark, the children &s;cream'd,</L>
<L>Up flew the windows all;</L>
<L>And ev'ry &s;oul cried out, "Well done!"</L>
<L>As loud as he could bawl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he!</L>
<L>His fame &s;oon &s;pread around&mdash;</L>
<L>"He carries weight!&mdash;he rides a race!&mdash;</L>
<L>"'Tis for a thou&s;and pound!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And &s;till, as fa&s;t as he drew near,</L>
<L>'Twas wonderful to view,</L>
<L>How, in a trice, the turnpike-men</L>
<L>Their gates wide open threw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="44" REF="030803_0043_0FE96608D31E8FD0">
<L>And now as he went bowing down</L>
<L>His reeking head full low,</L>
<L>The bottles twain behind his back,</L>
<L>Were &s;hattered at a blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Down ran the wine into the road</L>
<L>Mo&s;t piteous to be &s;een,</L>
<L>Which made his hor&s;e's flanks to &s;moke</L>
<L>As they had ba&s;ted been.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But &s;till he &s;eem'd to carry weight,</L>
<L>With leather girdle brac'd;</L>
<L>For all might &s;ee the bottle-necks</L>
<L>Still dangling at his wai&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus all through merry I&s;lington,</L>
<L>The&s;e gambols he did play,</L>
<L>And till he came unto the Wa&s;h</L>
<L>Of Edmonton &s;o gay;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And there he threw the Wa&s;h about</L>
<L>On both &s;ides of the way,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t like unto a trundling mop,</L>
<L>Or a wild goo&s;e at play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At Edmonton his loving wife</L>
<L>From the balcony &s;pied</L>
<L>Her tender hu&s;band, wond'ring much</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Stop, &s;top, John Gilpin! here's the hou&s;e!"</L>
<L>They all at once did cry;</L>
<L>"The dinner waits, and we are tir'd!"&mdash;</L>

<L>But yet his hor&s;e was not a whit</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>So like an arrow &s;wift he flew,</L>

<P>When Charles was about four years old, his father &s;ent him to a neighbouring &s;chool, where he was very &s;oon as much remarked for the progre&s;s he made in learning as he had been for his &s;weet temper. He read better than any boy in the &s;chool, and whenever he went be|fore
<PB N="50" REF="030803_0049_0FE96626255501C0">
his ma&s;ter to &s;pell, he was certain to get the fir&s;t place. This great quickne&s;s gave much delight to his fond parents and his tutor, though they ob&s;erved that with all his good qualities, Charles had one capital fault; in&s;tead of going directly to &s;chool he would often loiter in the fields till long after the other boys had gone in, and his books were always to be &s;ought for at the very time when he &s;hould have taken them to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>At a proper age, Charles was placed by his father at a great &s;chool, where he no longer found the indulgence to his faults, which he had met with from the village tutor. He was not allowed to defer the morning's ta&s;k till the afternoon, and it was remarked to him that he was inferior in learning to many who were his juniors in age. Charles was &s;tung with the re|mark; he knew that he was able to excel, and be re&s;olved that he would at &s;ome time take great pains, and obtain the &s;ame rank he had held in the village &s;chool; but he thought he might defer this till &s;ome future time. His work, while he was under the eye of his ma&s;ter, was performed as well, and in le&s;s time than that of mo&s;t of his &s;chool-fellows; but the ta&s;ks which he had to perform out of &s;chool hours were always deferred, and every thing furni&s;hed Charles with an excu&s;e for delay; not that he pa&s;&s;ed his vacant time in play; in&s;tead of that he was often employed in writing exerci&s;es for his &s;chool-fellows while they were amu&s;ing them&s;elves, and his own ta&s;k was deferred till the morning, when there was little time to per|form it well, and he was puni&s;hed for the faults.
<PB N="51" REF="030803_0050_0FE96706E81A24D0">
Thus poor Charles &s;eldom enjoyed the proper &s;ea&s;on for play. He was compelled to com|plete his ta&s;k, when his companions were en|joying them&s;elves in innocent &s;ports, and he was &s;eldom &s;et free from work till they were retiring to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Charles continued in this &s;ituation till the age of fourteen, and was every day remarked for his abilities to excel, and for tho&s;e habits of de|lay which often de&s;troyed all the advantages he naturally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Mr. Stanley then took him to London, and placed him with a Mer|chant, a friend of his, in the city, to whom he hoped Charles would become &s;o agreeable, as in time to be admitted into partner&s;hip with him. In this &s;ituation Charles gave the &s;trong|e&s;t proofs of integrity, &s;weet temper, and great abilities, but delay attended whatever he under|took; he was not dre&s;&s;ed till &s;ome hours after he &s;hould be at the de&s;k; he did not get to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e till the books were &s;hut, nor appear upon Change, till every man of bu|&s;ine&s;s had de&s;erted it. With more virtues, and greater ability, than almo&s;t any man of his ac|quaintance, he became a general object of ridicule and deri&s;ion, and when the term of his apprentice&s;hip expired, he found that, with a character which was &s;haded with only one foible, all intimate connexions with him were &s;hunned by the &s;ober part of the trading world.</P>
<P>About this time Charles had the misfortune to lo&s;e his father, who bequeathed him &s;uch a fortune as entitled him to expect a partner&s;hip in &s;ome re&s;pectable hou&s;e. But his known ha|bit of delay prevented his friends from making
<PB N="52" REF="030803_0051_0FE9662E61B87628">
the offer; and though he fully intended to &s;eek &s;uch a connexion, yet he continued to defer it till he had greatly le&s;&s;ened his little patrimony. His father had introduced him to &s;everal friends who might have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him greatly, but he had di&s;gu&s;ted them by his conduct, by deferring his vi&s;its to un&s;ea&s;onable hours, and by protracting them till the repeated yawns of the family informed him that it was time to de|part. Charles, who &s;aw him&s;elf in a &s;ituation where he was very likely to be without either friends or fortune, now re&s;olved to exert him|&s;elf, and to follow the plan which his father had traced out for his conduct in life. He could not, indeed, meet with an agreeable partner&s;hip, but he determined to enter into a mercantile line by him&s;elf; and his friends, who were delighted with his exertions, formed &s;uch exten&s;ive connexions for him, that he had the greate&s;t chance of being in a few years one of the riche&s;t men in the city. But alas! his habit of delay had acquired more &s;trength than he was aware of, and his efforts to conquer it were but tran&s;ient. Charles &s;oon relap&s;ed into his former indolence. He deferred bu&s;ine&s;s till he had not time to tran&s;act it. He neglect|ed to comply with the orders of his corre&s;pond|ents till the goods they &s;ent for were no longer wanted; and he omitted in&s;uring his ve&s;&s;els, not becau&s;e he intended to ri&s;k the lo&s;s, but becau&s;e, as he did not &s;ee them &s;inking he thought he might defer the bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ome future time. In a &s;hort time his bu&s;ine&s;s de|clined, &s;everal of his ve&s;&s;els had either been ta|ken or lo&s;t, his creditors poured in from every
<PB N="53" REF="030803_0052_0FE9662FEB2BE910">
quarter, his property could not an&s;wer their demands; and Charles Stanley, who&s;e integrity was re&s;pected by all, was hurried to pri&s;on, with the conviction that his misfortunes were the con&s;equence of his folly.</P>
<P>In this wretched &s;ituation Charles was a prey to &s;orrow. His heart was melted at the mi&s;ery which many poor and innocent families mu&s;t have &s;uffered from his failure; and he thought of the unea&s;ine&s;s he mu&s;t have given to his mo|ther with agony. Firmly did he re&s;olve, that if he could ever again be e&s;tabli&s;hed, he would atone by his future diligence for his pa&s;t mi&s;|conduct; but where could he look for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance? His mother had no more than was &s;uffi|cient for her &s;upport; and his brother had al|ready given him whatever he could afford. Charles was &s;itting alone, reflecting upon the &s;ad &s;ituation of his affairs, when he was inform|ed that a gentleman inquired for him below, and in a few moments he beheld a brother of his mother's, whom the family had believed to be dead, but who was ju&s;t returned from India with a large fortune. Mr. Hilton was much grieved at the mi&s;conduct and misfortunes of his nephew; but was &s;o much affected by his in|genuous account of his pa&s;t faults, and his re&s;o|lutions of amendment, that he generou&s;ly di&s;|charged all his debts, and enabled him to ap|pear again among&s;t his old acquaintance with credit.</P>
<P>Charles, fully &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;eries from which he had been delivered, was very earne&s;t to &s;ettle him&s;elf in &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s which would afford him &s;upport; and his kind uncle, who
<PB N="54" REF="030803_0053_0FE966349043CD98">
hoped that a new &s;cene would be favourable to his new-formed plans, earne&s;tly advi&s;ed him to embark for India, promi&s;ing to return with him that he might &s;ee him well &s;ettled. This good|ne&s;s filled the heart of Charles with the warme&s;t gratitude; he fell at his feet, and declared with tears, that he would exert him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to fulfil the commands of his generous bene|factor. Every thing was ordered for their de|parture, and when the time arrived for the &s;ail|ing of the &s;hip, Mr. Hilton went on board with &s;ome goods which were in readine&s;s, leaving his nephew to follow him to the Downs with tho&s;e which were not quite fini&s;hed. But de|lay again appeared in the conduct of Charles; he omitted inquiring after them till an expre&s;s arrived from Mr. Hilton, with the account that the ve&s;&s;el was to &s;ail the next day, and that he mu&s;t ha&s;ten down immediately. Charles then began to execute the orders which his uncle had left, but was detained &s;o long before he could get the goods, that when he reached the Downs he found the &s;hip had &s;ailed &s;ome hours. Almo&s;t di&s;tracted with this account, and with the thoughts of what his kind uncle mu&s;t think of his mi&s;conduct, he wandered about for &s;ome time in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and at length having become almo&s;t de&s;perate, he hired a quick-&s;ailing boat, in hopes of being able to overtake the &s;hip. For &s;ome time they ad|vanced rapidly, and gained &s;ight of the India &s;hip, and the heart of Charles was alternately agitated by hope and fear. But &s;uddenly the &s;ky was overca&s;t, the &s;ea &s;welled, the wind roared, and the boatmen declared that there
<PB N="55" REF="030803_0054_0FE96637D2C65DB0">
was every appearance of an approaching &s;torm, which &s;oon raged round them with the utmo&s;t fury. The ve&s;&s;el, which was too light to re|&s;i&s;t its force, was to&s;&s;ed about at the mercy of the wind and waves, and the only hope the un|happy Charles had of &s;aving his own life, and tho&s;e of his companions, was by reaching the &s;hip which they &s;aw at a &s;mall di&s;tance before them. But they exerted every effort in vain; a great &s;ea broke over the bark, and Mr. Hil|ton had the mi&s;ery of &s;eeing it &s;ink for ever into the bo&s;om of the ocean, and to lament the lo&s;s of the unfortunate Charles, who, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch talents as made him loved and admired by all, yet by one unhappy foible was rendered mi&s;erable and ridiculous through life, and &s;ubjected to a dreadful and premature death.</P>

<HEAD>THE NOSEGAY.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN DORMER, and his amiable La|dy, had lived during &s;everal years at their &s;eat in Dor&s;et&s;hire, happy in them&s;elves, and beloved by all around them, when they re|ceived the unwelcome account that the Captain was commanded to join his regiment, which
<PB N="56" REF="030803_0055_0FE966420F8C0E88">
was ordered to embark for America. The news of this event filled all the country with &s;orrow. The rich grieved for the lo&s;s of &s;o excellent a neighbour; the poor mourned for the departure of their kind and con&s;tant bene|factor; and the tenants and &s;ervants wept aloud at the thoughts of being &s;eparated from a ma&s;|ter who had always treated them more like children than dependants. But in vain were their intreaties that he would remain; honour called upon him to depart, and Mrs. Dormer &s;aw, with the utmo&s;t &s;orrow, that to honour he would &s;acrifice the &s;tronge&s;t feelings of his brea&s;t. She re&s;olved, however, not to be left behind, and in a &s;hort time they exchanged the tranquil plea&s;ures of Belmount, for the horrors of carnage and war.</P>
<P>Mrs. Dormer had not been long in America before &s;he lay-in of twins, both daughters, and very beautiful. In the care of the&s;e &s;weet children &s;he found &s;ome relief during the fre|quent ab&s;ences of her hu&s;band, and would oft|en indulge the hope of returning peace, when the Captain, in&s;tead of engaging in the &s;laugh|ter of his fellow-creatures, might enjoy the delight of improving his little Fanny and So|phia. The children daily became more fond of their parents, often clinging to their father when they &s;aw him preparing to go out, and always clapping their little hands with joy when they &s;aw him return. As &s;oon as they were able to &s;peak, Mrs. Dormer taught them to &s;ay Papa, and in a &s;hort time, when they &s;aw him at a di&s;tance, they would directly leave their play, and running up to Mama, would
<PB N="57" REF="030803_0056_0FE96643942CFE48">
cry out,
<Q>Papa is come, dear papa is come to &s;ee his little girls.</Q></P>
<P>The improvement of the children became more vi&s;ible every day, and they were daily more dear to their parents, when Captain Dor|mer, returning from a foraging party, was fiercely and &s;uddenly attacked by the Indians, and a de&s;perate engagement en&s;ued. The time when Mrs. Dormer had expected his return had long pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;he &s;at in &s;ilent agony look|ing at her dear children, whom at one moment &s;he feared were deprived of their parent, and the next, &s;tepping to the room door, &s;he anxi|ou&s;ly li&s;tened to every noi&s;e, and was fearful, le&s;t even the &s;ound of her own breath &s;hould prevent her from hearing the well-known &s;tep of her beloved hu&s;band. At length a &s;ound reached her ears&mdash;it came nearer; it increa&s;ed, and &s;he flew down &s;tairs in the fond hope of welcoming the return of what was mo&s;t dear to her. The door was opened, but it no longer opened to admit the tender hu&s;band and fond father joyfully returning from the labours of the day; Captain Dormer was brought in a mangled lifele&s;s corp&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus cruelly deprived of her hu&s;band, Mrs. Dormer re&s;olved to return to England, and to employ her time in the education of her little girls. She took them down into Dor&s;et&s;hire, and in&s;tructed them her&s;elf; and little Fanny and Sophia Dormer were &s;oon remarked as the neate&s;t work-women in the country. But their good Mama did not direct their attention merely to the little arts of making trifling or|naments: &s;he taught them that virtue was &s;u|perior
<PB N="58" REF="030803_0057_0FE96649DD607648">
to accompli&s;hments, and that what was u&s;eful was more excellent than what was merely elegant. Little Fanny &s;oon under&s;tood, that though mu&s;ic gave her great delight, it was &s;till more delightful by her own &s;weetne&s;s to charm all around her; and Sophia learned that no plea&s;ure was equal to the plea&s;ure of doing good to her fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>In this happy retirement Mrs. Dormer con|tinued for &s;ome years improving her &s;weet girls in real virtue and u&s;eful knowledge. At this time Lady Aubrey, a relation of Mrs. Dormer's paid her a vi&s;it, and upon her re+turn would gladly have prevailed with the good mother to &s;uffer both her daughters to &s;pend &s;ome time with her in London. This, how|ever, Mrs. Dormer could not agree to; but as Fanny had &s;hown a &s;trong affection for her La|dy&s;hip, and earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to &s;ee London, &s;he con&s;ented to her going; and Sophia, who preferred the company of her Mama to any other enjoyment, was left at home. At fir&s;t indeed, &s;he felt unea&s;y without her &s;i&s;ter; &s;he found a &s;olo on the harp&s;ichord was not half &s;o agreeable as a duet, and the beautiful alcove in the garden was not near &s;o plea&s;ant, as when Fanny &s;at with her there, at her drawing or needle-work. By degrees, however, &s;he be|came reconciled to her lo&s;s, but frequently thought that Fanny could not enjoy half the plea&s;ure in London that &s;he did at Belmount, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her Mama to work for the poor people of the village, or in going with her to vi&s;it tho&s;e who were &s;ick. But her greate&s;t de|light was in the office which Mrs. Dormer had
<PB N="59" REF="030803_0058_0FE9664D786996E0">
given her of di&s;tributing the broken victuals, which were given away to the poor every day at her gate. This was the highe&s;t plea&s;ure Sophia could receive. She flew with rapture to the hou&s;e-keeper to obtain her welcome burden, under which &s;he tottered to the door. She exulted in &s;eeing &s;o many poor creatures made happy by her bounty, and delighted to hear them &s;ay,
<Q>Here comes the good little girl; &s;he will, one day, be as good a lady as her Mama;</Q>
and &s;he often thought with great plea&s;ure of the joy which her &s;i&s;ter Fanny would have, when &s;he returned, in this new employment.</P>
<P>But Fanny's vi&s;it to Lady Aubrey unfitted her for the innocent plea&s;ures of Belmount. She never heard of &s;uch a thing as working for the poor from her Lady&s;hip; and cards, dre&s;s, and elegant equipages, engaged the attention of all the circles to which Fanny was admitted. She almo&s;t learned to forget the poor; and when &s;he returned to Belmount, &s;he &s;poke haughtily to the &s;ervants, and &s;carcely noticed her inferiors; and when the poor came to re|ceive their daily allowance, in&s;tead of &s;erving them, &s;he either turned away, or &s;uffered her little favourite dog, Surly, to bark at them, and &s;hake their tattered cloaths. All the village talked of her pride, and lamented that the good Mrs. Dormer &s;hould have &s;uch a naughty little girl; but the good and gentle Sophia was loved by them all. They pre&s;ented her with the choice&s;t flowers in their gardens, and the mo&s;t beautiful bantams and pea-fowls were &s;ent to the poultry-yard of the good little girl that be|haved
<PB N="60" REF="030803_0059_0FE96655C6ECB868">
&s;o well to every one. When Mrs. Dor|mer came from church, all the farmers and their wives made their be&s;t bows and curt&s;ies to the good lady, who &s;poke kindly to them all. She was followed by Fanny, who never turned her head a&s;ide; but when Sophia came near, the children plucked one another, and &s;aid,
<Q>Here comes the good young lady, &s;ee how good humoured &s;he looks: &s;he will a&s;k us all how we do.</Q></P>
<P>Fanny could not avoid &s;eeing how di&s;agree|able her pride made her to every body, and &s;he found her&s;elf much le&s;s happy than &s;he was be|fore &s;he went to London; but &s;he had learned there to think that &s;uch behaviour was right, and, if it was an error, &s;he fooli&s;hly re&s;olved ra|ther to adhere to it than to own &s;he had been wrong. She was one day invited with her &s;i&s;ter to a ball at the hou&s;e of a lady in the neighbour|hood, where &s;he was to meet all the young peo|ple in that country. Her heart exulted in the thoughts of this gay party, and &s;he re&s;olved to behave in the &s;ame manner &s;he had &s;een &s;ome fa&s;hionable ladies do in London. Upon enter|ing the room &s;he advanced to a &s;mall knot of young ladies of her acquaintance; and, without &s;peaking to the re&s;t of the company, began to make remarks upon their dre&s;s and manners in a whi&s;pering voice, but in a tone loud enough to be heard. After &s;ome time a young lady, whom &s;he had never &s;een before, entered the room, in a dre&s;s made up in a manner very dif|ferent from any that Fanny had ever ob&s;erved; &s;he directly began to &s;neer at her, and declared, that for her part &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed &s;uch &s;trange
<PB N="61" REF="030803_0060_0FE966574D8D21A8">
figures &s;hould think of mixing with people of fa&s;hion, and wondered where they came from. The young lady, confounded at &s;o rude a re|ception, retired to a corner, where &s;he was joined by the good humoured Sophia, who chatted with her till the lady of the hou&s;e re|turned into the room, and introduced her into the company as the elde&s;t daughter of the Duke of Dor&s;et, who was ju&s;t returned from a tour to France. Nothing could exceed the chagrin of Fanny, when &s;he found that the young lady whom &s;he had been ridiculing was the principal per&s;on in the company, and that the dre&s;s &s;he had de&s;pi&s;ed, was the admiration of all who &s;aw it. She had not the a&s;&s;urance to endea|vour to repair her fault by apologies, or to pre&s;s her acquaintance upon the lady whom &s;he had &s;o gro&s;sly affronted. Indeed &s;he &s;aw that nei|ther her excu&s;es nor intimacy would be accept|ed, and &s;he had the mortification of hearing her &s;i&s;ter Sophia receive a very pre&s;&s;ing invi|tation to Dor&s;et Hou&s;e, in which &s;he was not included.</P>
<P>Fanny was greatly mortified at this incident, and &s;he re&s;olved never to behave in &s;uch a man|ner again. She ought, indeed, directly to have endeavoured to conquer every feeling of pride, and to return to that behaviour which made her beloved by every body; but &s;he only re&s;olved that &s;he would not again laugh aloud at a &s;tranger in a genteel company, and run the ri&s;k of offending her &s;uperiors. As to the poor and mi&s;erable, &s;he thought them beneath her regard.</P>
<P>Some time after this, Fanny and Sophia were
<PB N="62" REF="030803_0061_0FE9665DB941CA88">
again invited to the hou&s;e of a lady, whom, as Fanny regarded her as a per&s;on of great ta&s;te, &s;he was de&s;irous to plea&s;e her by appearance. She put on all her little finery, but found that one thing was nece&s;&s;ary to complete her dre&s;s, which was a No&s;egay, and this &s;he was deter|mined to buy when they reached the town. They &s;et off in the carriage, attended only by &s;ervants, and by Fanny's little dog, which ran at the &s;ide of the chariot. Fanny could talk of nothing but of calling at the flori&s;t's, and of the elegant No&s;egay with which &s;he &s;hould be adorned. At length they &s;aw a little tattered girl laying a&s;leep upon the &s;ide of the road, whom Surley directly attacked, and began to &s;hake her ragged cloaths. Sophia called him ha&s;tily away, and would have &s;ucceeded before he had awakened the poor little girl, but Fanny encouraged him to proceed; upon this the child &s;tarting up, aimed a blow at the dog, which he avoided, and made a &s;nap at her leg. The poor terrified girl then endeavoured to run away, but in running mi&s;&s;ed her &s;tep, and fell down the bank into the ditch. She had hurt her foot, and lay crying in the ditch till Sophia ordered the &s;ervant to take her up, and, contrary to the advice of Fanny, de&s;ired him to place her in the chariot that they might convey her home. She then began to comfort the poor child, and inquired about her hurt; but &s;he continued to cry out, "O my poor mammy, my poor mam|my, what will &s;he do, now I cannot run a|bout and beg for her and my daddy!" "Who is your mammy," &s;aid Sophia, "and what &s;hall we do for your foot?" "Oh! don't mind my
<PB N="63" REF="030803_0062_0FE96660F67C0B38">
foot," &s;aid the child, "give me only &s;ome bread for my poor mammy and daddy, and my little brother, and I don't care what becomes of my foot."</P>
<P>The child had &s;carcely fini&s;hed her &s;peech when the carriage &s;topped at the door of a cot|tage, which the little girl &s;aid was her home. When &s;he attempted to get out, &s;he found her|&s;elf unable to walk, and was obliged to be car|ried by the footman, who, accompanied by So|phia, entered the hou&s;e, while Fanny remained in the carriage &s;ullenly pouting at her &s;i&s;ter's conde&s;cen&s;ion, and very angry to be &s;o delayed. She was indeed &s;orry to &s;ee the poor child &s;o hurt, and when &s;he was taken out of the car|riage gave her what money &s;he could &s;pare; but &s;he took care to keep enough to buy her elegant No&s;egay. When Sophia entered the hou&s;e, &s;he found a &s;cene of mi&s;ery which &s;he could not have conceived. The father of the little girl had long laboured under an ague and fever, her mother was worn down with poverty and fatigue, and her little brother crying for hunger in a corner of a poor cottage, &s;trip|ed of almo&s;t of all its furniture, which had been &s;old to buy nece&s;&s;aries. Sophia found that little Sally had gone out in the morning to beg &s;omething for this afflicted family, and that, quite exhau&s;ted with hunger and fatigue, &s;he &s;et down upon the bank and cried her&s;elf to &s;leep. The tender heart of Sophia was greatly affected by this di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he empitied her pocket of every farthing which it contained, and gave it to the good woman of the hou&s;e, and would not keep enough to buy the collar which &s;he
<PB N="64" REF="030803_0063_0FE96665A68F3B28">
had once intended for her little favourite &s;quir|rel. She then prepared to leave the cottage, but before &s;he went, de&s;ired the poor people to get what was nece&s;&s;ary, and told them &s;he would &s;oon return with her good Mama, who would give them cloaths and victuals enough.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters then proceeded to their vi&s;it. Fanny bought her No&s;egay, which was very beautiful: but the &s;weetne&s;s of Sophia, and the cheerfulne&s;s which the thoughts of the good action &s;he had been performing in&s;pired her with, made her &s;o agreeable, that all the com|pany were charmed with her, but paid little attention to Fanny. At night, when they re|turned, Mrs. Dormer noticed Fanny's No&s;e|gay, which, though it had begun to fade, was &s;till very beautiful. This plea&s;ed Fanny, and &s;he cried out, "Ah! Mama, I was &s;ure you would like it, it is &s;o very pretty, and my &s;i&s;ter liked it very much indeed." "Then why did &s;he not buy one?" &s;aid Mrs. Dormer; Fanny hung down her head, and in a faultering tone an&s;wered, "Becau&s;e &s;he had no money." Mrs. Dormer, &s;urpri&s;ed at this, for &s;he had given &s;ome to each of them that very morning, in|quired from Sophia what was become of it; Sophia then recounted to her mother the con|dition in which &s;he had &s;een the poor people at the cottage, but took care not to mention a word of Fanny's ill behaviour: &s;he then told her the way in which &s;he had di&s;po&s;ed of her money, and the promi&s;e &s;he had made of tak|ing her Mama to the cottage; and ended by begging that &s;he would go with her in the morning. Tran&s;ported with her conduct, Mrs.
<PB N="65" REF="030803_0064_0FE966690E336810">
Dormer pre&s;&s;ed her virtuous child to her bo&s;om, and promi&s;ed to take care of the wretched fa|mily, for whom Sophia was &s;o much intere&s;ted. Then looking with anger at Fanny, &s;he &s;aid, "Did you then give nothing to the&s;e poor unhappy creatures?" Fanny hung down her head in &s;ilence, for &s;he was a&s;hamed to &s;peak; but Sophia &s;aid, "Oh yes, Mama, indeed &s;he gave them all the money &s;he had; except ju&s;t enough to buy her No&s;egay and a trinket for her little watch; and I am &s;ure if &s;he had gone into the cottage and &s;een their mi&s;ery, &s;he would have given them that too." "She &s;at at the door then," &s;aid Mrs. Dormer, "while you went in." Then turning to Fanny, "Proud and unfeeling girl," &s;aid &s;he, "who could pre|fer vain and trifling ornaments to the delight of relieving the &s;ick and mi&s;erable! Retire from my pre&s;ence; take with you your trinket and No&s;egay, and receive from them all the com|forts which they are able to be&s;tow."</P>
<P>Sophia would gladly have retired with her &s;i&s;ter; &s;he was grieved at the di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he had incurred from her Mama, and &s;he wi&s;hed earne&s;tly to &s;ooth and comfort the dejected Fanny. Mrs. Dormer, however, cho&s;e that &s;he &s;hould be left alone, and Fanny was obliged to pa&s;s the night by her&s;elf. She then began to reflect upon the happine&s;s which &s;he had known be|fore &s;he went to vi&s;it Lady Aubrey: &s;he was then beloved by every one, every body met her with a &s;mile; all the &s;ervants were ready to oblige her, and all the neighbours loved her: now all was changed, and no one except Sophia, no, not even her Mama, &s;eemed to love her.
<PB N="66" REF="030803_0065_0FE96671582C08B8">
At this thought &s;he wept bitterly. "And why am I not beloved?" &s;aid &s;he. "And why does every one &s;hun me, at the very time that they are &s;o fond of my &s;i&s;ter? Alas! it is becau&s;e I am not &s;o good as &s;he." Fanny then thought of the vexatious &s;ituations into which &s;he had been brought by her vanity and pride. They had cau&s;ed her to be &s;hunned not only by her inferiors, but by tho&s;e above her, and had made her generally hated or de&s;pi&s;ed. Heartily a&s;ham|ed of her conduct, and grieved at its con&s;e|quences, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the night in weeping, and re&s;olved that &s;he would again be good, and again behave in &s;uch a man|ner as &s;hould make her beloved by all, and hap|py in her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Towards morning Fanny fell a&s;leep, and, as &s;he was much tired with lying awake &s;o long, &s;he &s;lept till it was pretty late; the next day when &s;he awoke, &s;he inquired for her Mama, and was re&s;olved to a&s;k her forgivene&s;s, and to inform her of her &s;orrow for her pa&s;t faults, and her re&s;olutions to amend. She was informed that Mrs. Dormer and Sophia were gone to the cottage, and had taken cloaths, and other nece&s;&s;aries for the family, and had &s;ent for a phy&s;ician to attend the &s;ick man. "Ah!" &s;aid &s;he, "Sophia is happy, and &s;he de&s;erves to be &s;o, for &s;he is good; I was not worthy to have the plea&s;ure of going to the cottage, but I will be good and happy too." She then ro&s;e, and the fir&s;t thing &s;he &s;aw was her No&s;egay, which the maid had carefully put into a pot of water the night before. "This No&s;egay," &s;aid Fanny, "&s;hall be the con&s;tant memorial of my faults, and of my repentance." She then reach|ed
<PB N="67" REF="030803_0066_0FE9667493F71580">
her pallet, and making a beautiful &s;ketch of the almo&s;t dying flowers, &s;he wrote under them in a large hand, <HI>Virtue never fades,</HI> and placed the drawing in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the room. When Mrs. Dormer returned, &s;he was &s;truck with this elegant performance, and calling for Fanny, had the delight of hearing from her&s;elf what had pa&s;&s;ed in her mind during the pa&s;t night, and her re&s;olutions of amend|ment. After &s;ome time, during which Fanny had entirely laid a&s;ide her haughty behaviour, the indulgent Mrs. Dormer would have re|moved the drawing that it might no longer mortify her child; but Fanny begged it might remain, and whenever &s;he found her&s;elf inclined to return to her former folly, &s;he placed her&s;elf before the picture, which &s;oon became, not merely the &s;hameful memorial of pa&s;t faults, but the elegant monument of her return to virtue.</P>

<HEAD>COURAGE INSPIRED BY FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>TWO &s;ailors, a Frenchman named Robert, and a native of Spain, called Antonio, were &s;laves to the &s;ame ma&s;ter at Algiers Friend&s;hip is the only con&s;olation of per&s;ons in di&s;tre&s;s.
<PB N="68" REF="030803_0067_0FE9667AEB72A288">
Antonio and Robert happily enjoyed this con&s;o|lation&mdash;they communicated to each other their mutual griefs; they conver&s;ed perpetually about their families, their countries, and of the exqui|&s;ite delight which the recovery of their liberty, &s;hould it ever be granted to their wi&s;hes, would afford them. Their conferences always ended in a flood of affectionate tears, and this expan|&s;ion of their hearts enabled them both to &s;up|port the hard labour, which was their daily lot, with uncommon fortitude.</P>
<P>The ta&s;k appointed them was the con&s;truc|tion of a road on the top of a cliff which over|hung the &s;ea. One morning the Spaniard re&s;t|ing for a moment from his toil, and ca&s;ting an anxious look on the &s;ea, "My friend," &s;aid he, "all my vows, all my hopes, are directed towards the oppo&s;ite bounds of that va&s;t liquid plain; why can I not, in company with the partner of my woes, attain tho&s;e happy &s;hores? My wife, my children, are ever before my eyes, eagerly longing for my arrival, or bit|terly lamenting my &s;uppo&s;ed death." Antonio perpetually indulged him&s;elf in the&s;e gloomy reflexions, and every day that he was &s;ummon|ed to his work on the cliff, he turned his eyes to the ocean, and regretted the fatal expan&s;e which &s;eparated him from his friends and his country.</P>
<P>It chanced that one day a Chri&s;tian &s;hip appeared at anchor not very di&s;tant from the &s;hore. "There friend," cried the Spaniard, "do you &s;ee that ve&s;&s;el? She brings us life and liberty. Though &s;he will not touch here, (for every one avoids the&s;e barbarous coa&s;ts) yet to-morrow
<PB N="69" REF="030803_0068_0FE9667E28945DE0">
if you choo&s;e it, Robert, our woes &s;hall end, and we will be free! Yes, to-morrow that &s;hip will pa&s;s within a league of the &s;hore, and we will plunge into the &s;ea from this rock, or peri&s;h in the attempt; for even death is preferable to this cruel &s;lavery." "If you can &s;ave your&s;elf," replied Robert, "I &s;hall &s;up|port my unhappy lot with greater re&s;ignation. You know, Antonio, how dear you are to me; my friend&s;hip for you will only terminate with my life. I have only one favour to a&s;k of you; endeavour to find out my father&mdash;If grief for my lo&s;s, and old age, have not already de|&s;troyed him, tell him"&mdash;"What do you mean?" an&s;wered Antonio; "I &s;eek your fa|ther!&mdash;And do you think I could live happily a &s;ingle moment with the idea of having left you in chains?" "But I cannot &s;wim," cried Robert; "and you know"&mdash;"I know that I have the &s;tronge&s;t friend&s;hip for you," replied the Spaniard, embracing him, and &s;hedding tears of affection:
<Q>friend&s;hip will give me re|doubled &s;trength: you &s;hall hold upon my belt, and we will both &s;ave our&s;elves.</Q>
In vain did Robert repre&s;ent the danger there would be of his peri&s;hing him&s;elf, and dragging his pre|&s;erver down with him to de&s;truction; nothing could overcome the re&s;olution of Antonio.
<Q>We will both e&s;cape, or both peri&s;h toge|ther,</Q>
he cried. "But we draw the attention of our &s;avage keepers; even &s;ome of our com|panions would be ba&s;e enough to betray us&mdash; Farewel&mdash;I hear the bell that calls us from our work; we mu&s;t &s;eparate; farewel till to-mor|row!"</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="030803_0069_0FE96684A75CFB08">They now returned to their dungeon.&mdash; Antonio was wrapped up in the idea of his pro|ject: he fancied he had already pa&s;&s;ed the Mediterranean, and was in the arms of his friends, his wife, and his children. But Ro|bert formed to him&s;elf a very different picture: he &s;aw his friend falling a victim to his own genero&s;ity, and dragged by him to the bottom of the &s;ea, and peri&s;hing by that means, when, if he had only con&s;ulted his own &s;afety, he might have pre&s;erved him&s;elf, and been re&s;tored to the bo&s;om of his family, who mo&s;t proba|bly were continually lamenting his lo&s;s. "No," &s;aid the unfortunate Frenchman to him&s;elf,
<Q>I will not give way to the &s;olicitations of An|tonio; I will not repay &s;o generous a friend|&s;hip by being the cau&s;e of his death. He will be free. My unhappy father will at lea&s;t learn that I am alive, and that my affec|tion for him is unabated. Alas! I could wi&s;h to be the &s;upport and con&s;olation of his age. He wanted my a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;perhaps he is now peri&s;hing in poverty, and wi&s;hing to &s;ee and embrace his &s;on. However, if Antonio is happy, I &s;hall die with le&s;s re|gret.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;laves were not taken from their pri&s;on the next morning at the u&s;ual hour. The Spaniard was all impatience, while Robert was in doubt whether he &s;hould rejoice or grieve at the di&s;appointment. At length they were call|ed to their labour, but they could not &s;peak to each other, for their ma&s;ter went with them. Antonio could only look at Robert and &s;igh. Sometimes he ca&s;t his eyes towards the &s;ea, and
<PB N="71" REF="030803_0070_0FE96687E84B9CE0">
could hardly &s;uppre&s;s his emotions. At length night arrives, and they find them&s;elves alone. "Let us &s;eize this opportunity," cries the Spa|niard, "Come!" "No," replies the other: my friend I never will con&s;ent to endanger your life: farewel, Antonio! I embrace you for the la&s;t time. Save your&s;elf, I conjure you; you have no time to lo&s;e. Remember our friend&s;hip. I only reque&s;t you to remember your promi&s;e in regard to my father. He mu&s;t be very old, and much in di&s;tre&s;s; go and con&s;ole him. If he &s;hould want a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I am &s;ure my friend"&mdash;At the&s;e words the voice of Robert failed&mdash;he &s;hed a torrent of tears&mdash;his bo&s;om was torn with angui&s;h. "You weep, Robert," &s;ays Antonio; "it is not tears, but courage, that we now want: re&s;i&s;t no longer; a moment's delay may ruin us; we may never have the opportunity again; either deliver your&s;elf to my direction, or I will da&s;h my head again&s;t tho&s;e rocks."</P>
<P>The Frenchman threw him&s;elf at the feet of the generous Spaniard: he &s;till repre&s;ented the hazard of the attempt, and pointed out the in|evitable danger that mu&s;t attend his re&s;olution of endeavouring to pre&s;erve him. Antonio made no reply, but catching him in his arms, he ran to the edge of the precipice, and plung|ed with him into the &s;ea. At fir&s;t they both &s;unk; but, ri&s;ing to the &s;urface, Antonio ex|erted all his force, and &s;wimming him&s;elf, kept Robert al&s;o above the water, who &s;eemed to re|fu&s;e his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to fear le&s;t he &s;hould in|volve him in his own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The people in the &s;hip were &s;truck with an

</FIGURE>
object which they could not well di&s;tingui&s;h. They thought it was &s;ome &s;ea-mon&s;ter that ap|proached the ve&s;&s;el. Their curio&s;ity was now called another way; they &s;aw a boat leave the &s;hore and ha&s;tily pur&s;ue what &s;eemed to them a mon&s;trous &s;ea-animal. The&s;e were the &s;oldi|ers who guarded the &s;laves, and who were anxious to overtake Antonio and Robert. The la&s;t &s;aw them approach, and, ca&s;ting his eyes on his friend, and perceiving that he grew weak, he made an effort and got loo&s;e from An|tonio,
<PB N="73" REF="030803_0072_0FE9669043799A48">
&s;aying to him at the &s;ame time. "We "are pur&s;ued. Save your&s;elf, and let me pe|ri&s;h; I only retard your cour&s;e." He had hardly fini&s;hed the&s;e words when he &s;unk. A new tran&s;port of friend&s;hip animates the Spani|ard; he darts towards the Frenchman, and &s;eizing him as he is ju&s;t ready to expire, they both di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The boat, uncertain which way to pur&s;ue, &s;topped; while another was &s;ent from the ve&s;&s;el to di&s;cover what the object was which they had &s;een. The waves began to grow rough; at la&s;t they di&s;covered two men, the one &s;up|porting the other, and trying to reach the ve&s;|&s;el. They rowed to them as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and came up with them ju&s;t as Antonio's &s;trength began to fail. They took them both on board. Antonio cried out feebly,
<Q>A&s;&s;i&s;t my friend&mdash;I die;</Q>
&mdash;and his countenance &s;eemed convul&s;ed with the agonies of death. Robert, who was in a &s;woon, recovering at the in&s;tant, and &s;eeing Antonio without any &s;ign of life extended by his &s;ide, was almo&s;t di&s;|tracted; he threw him&s;elf on the body of his friend. "Antonio!" he cried, "my dear Antonio, my friend, my deliverer, have I been your murderer? Alas! you cannot hear me. Is this your recompen&s;e for having &s;aved my life? But what is life? Who can &s;upport it af|ter the lo&s;s of &s;uch a friend?"</P>
<P>Saying this, he &s;tarted up in the boat, and, &s;eizing a &s;word, would have plunged it into his bo&s;om, if he had not been di&s;armed; but in the mid&s;t of his lamentations and di&s;traction, Providence, apparently to reward an affection
<PB N="74" REF="030803_0073_0FE9669A9CEBD6D0">
&s;o &s;incere, interpo&s;ed in his favour&mdash;Antonio breathed a &s;igh. Robert flew to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friend, who, lifting up his languid eyes, tried to find the Frenchman, and, as &s;oon as he perceived him, cried out with a tran&s;port be|yond his &s;trength, "I have &s;aved my friend!"</P>
<P>They were both conveyed on board the ve&s;|&s;el. Their exemplary friend&s;hip diffu&s;ed a re&s;pect for them among the whole crew. And, &s;uch is the effect of virtue even on the rough|e&s;t minds, every one contended with his fel|lows in &s;howing them attention. Robert ar|riving in France flew to his father, who was ready to die with exce&s;s of joy at &s;eeing him, and was appointed to a genteel office under the Government. But the Spaniard, who was likewi&s;e offered a very advantageous po&s;t, for one in his &s;ituation of life, cho&s;e rather to re|turn to his wife and family. But ab&s;ence did not dimini&s;h his friend&s;hip; he continued &s;till to corre&s;pond with Robert, and their letters, which are ma&s;ter-pieces of &s;implicity and affec|tion, do honour to the &s;entiment which was capable of producing &s;o heroic an action.</P>

<HEAD>THE DUEL; OR THE MAN OF TRUE COURAGE.</HEAD>
<P>MELCOUR lo&s;t his parents at an age when he could not be &s;en&s;ible of the greatne&s;s of his mi&s;|fortune. One of his uncles took him home, brought him up with his own &s;on, and paid the
<PB N="75" REF="030803_0074_0FE9669C247A41C0">
utmo&s;t attention to his education. Florival and Melcour, already united by the ties of kin|dred, were &s;oon more &s;o by tho&s;e of friend&s;hip, which, from their living con&s;tantly together, grew &s;tronger every day. They were both de|&s;igned for the army. When they were of a proper age, they got commi&s;&s;ions in the &s;ame regiment. Florival always hated application, and the di&s;&s;ipation that naturally attends a mi|litary life &s;till inclined him le&s;s to it. As for Melcour, he had not only a very good natural genius, but a &s;trong inclination to cultivate it. His &s;tudies had been properly directed; and a generous and humane di&s;po&s;ition, joined with a habit of thinking &s;eriou&s;ly, led him to condemn the criminal practice of fighting duels on tri|vial occa&s;ions, a cu&s;tom too prevalent in the army.</P>
<P>Different pur&s;uits le&s;&s;ened, by degrees, the friend&s;hip of the two young men. Florival was blinded by the love of plea&s;ure, he ran in|to all &s;orts of extravagance, and became in|volved in debt. Melcour lamented his folly, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with his pur&s;e, and endeavoured to &s;ave him from the ruin into which he was going to plunge. He repre&s;ented to him how much his conduct degraded him in the eyes of &s;en&s;ible people. "Even tho&s;e," &s;aid he to him, "who now applaud your extravagance, will be the fir&s;t to upbraid you when they &s;ee you in di&s;|tre&s;s. They call them&s;elves your be&s;t friends, and you believe them; they have e&s;tranged you from me. They have painted me to you in the mo&s;t unfavourable colours, and if they have not entirely extingui&s;hed the friend&s;hip
<PB N="76" REF="030803_0075_0FE966A2724BB3B0">
that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, at lea&s;t they have greatly weakened it. The wretches well knew my &s;incere affection for you; they are informed of the pains I have taken to di&s;cover to you their perfidious de&s;igns, and they wi&s;h to pu|ni&s;h me for them. O, my friend, if they &s;hould &s;ucceed in robbing me of your e&s;teem, their triumph will be too complete! But, my dear Florival! I do not &s;peak on my own account only. I conjure you, by every &s;entiment of virtue that united our infancy, not to plunge a dagger in the heart of the be&s;t of fathers. If he were to know the exce&s;&s;es you run into he would die with &s;orrow."</P>
<P>The&s;e remon&s;trances touched the heart of Florival. He promi&s;ed to amend; but his perfidious friends repre&s;ented vice to him in &s;o amiable a form, that he was unable to re&s;i&s;t. Melcour being informed, that, after having lo&s;t a great &s;um of money at play, he was gone to di&s;&s;ipate his &s;orrow by infamous debauchery, immediately went to him, and urged to him, with &s;ome vehemence, the duties of his &s;itua|tion, and the promi&s;es he had made to fulfil them.</P>
<P>Florival was no longer ma&s;ter of him&s;elf; he fell into a mo&s;t violent rage again&s;t his cou|&s;in; he even drew his &s;word on him; and on Melcour's refu&s;ing to fight him, he abu&s;ed him in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms, and was almo&s;t tempted to &s;trike him. His cou&s;in &s;till kept his tem|per: unworthy as Florival appeared of his af|fection, he yet only regarded him as a friend and relation.</P>
<P>Overcome by this &s;teadine&s;s, he at length
<PB N="77" REF="030803_0076_0FE966A60C2C7868">
recovered his temper. He was a&s;hamed of his behaviour, and begged pardon of Melcour for his violence, which was immediately granted by the generous youth, and an immediate and perfect reconciliation took place.</P>
<P>An officer belonging to another regiment happened to be pre&s;ent during the affair; he had been witne&s;s to the provocation given by Florival, and he imputed the coolne&s;s of his cou&s;in to want of courage. He did not fail to make many &s;arca&s;tic remarks on it, and they came at length to the ears of &s;ome of Melcour's friends. The lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion is deemed injuri|ous to the honour of a &s;oldier. After many inquiries, it was di&s;covered who&s;e conduct had given ri&s;e to the &s;candal. They were told the honour of the corps was wounded through them, and it was their duty to vindicate it. The means were evident. If the report was true, they mu&s;t fight each other; if fal&s;e, they mu&s;t puni&s;h the author of it. Melcour was truly mi&s;erable. His principles di&s;approved of duelling in any in&s;tance; and in this, if he obeyed the injunctions of his corps, he was re|duced to the terrible nece&s;&s;ity of plunging his &s;word into the bo&s;om of his relation and friend. But, in vain did he repre&s;ent his feelings to his brother officers, they would hear of nothing but the choice of weapons, time, and place. His &s;orrow was unutterable: he retired to his apartment. Florival, who went to look for him, found him leaning on a table, hiding his face with his hands, his eyes &s;treaming with tears, and his continual &s;ighs only interrupted by the frequent repetition of the name of Flori|val.
<PB N="78" REF="030803_0077_0FE966AE2997B868">
At &s;uch a &s;ight he was not able to con|tain him&s;elf; he threw him&s;elf at the feet of his friend. His appearance recalled to Melcour all the horror of his &s;ituation&mdash;"What! in a moment I am called upon to pierce your heart, and do you come to &s;eek me?&mdash;O Florival!" &s;aid he, his voice almo&s;t choaked with tears, "&s;hould my arm deprive you of life, I would not &s;urvive you. What &s;hould I &s;ay to your fa|ther? did he take &s;o much care of my infancy, to &s;ee me &s;tained with the blood of his &s;on? O, wretched old man, whatever may be the event of this horrid duel, it will be an eternal &s;ource of angui&s;h for you!"</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant &s;ome of the officers forced open the door; they came to tell Melcour he could not delay the combat any longer without giving room to call his courage in que&s;tion. What a terrible &s;ituation! At this in&s;tant the two friends were embracing each other&mdash;they were unable to return any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Florival was the fir&s;t who broke this mourn|ful &s;ilence. In him the mi&s;taken principles of honour at pre&s;ent prevailed over tho&s;e of friend|&s;hip. He got up, and extended his arm to a&s;|&s;i&s;t Melcour, without daring to look at him. He aro&s;e and walked about the room in the greate&s;t agitation; he fancied he &s;aw his rela|tion and friend murdered by his hands, and his di&s;tracted uncle demanding vengeance for the blood of his &s;on. At length, recovering him&s;elf, he turned to the officers, and &s;aid to to them in a firm and re&s;olute tone of voice: I will no longer he&s;itate to act that part which is pointed out to me by the voice of religion, of
<PB N="79" REF="030803_0078_0FE966AFB6606130">
rea&s;on, and of humanity, be the con&s;equence what it may. My determination is fixed. Go, and inform tho&s;e who &s;ent you, that Melcour prefers an <HI>imaginary</HI> di&s;honour to a <HI>real</HI> crime, and that no con&s;ideration upon earth &s;hall tempt him to point his &s;word again&s;t the bo&s;om of his friend. This an&s;wer determined his fate. His brother officers informed him with the &s;incere&s;t regret, that, as he had refu&s;ed to fight, it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to roll with him, and that he mu&s;t quit the regiment. Who can de&s;cribe the feelings of Florival, when he heard this &s;entence? it was <HI>he</HI> who had brought Melcour into this terrible &s;ituation. The di&s;grace of his cou&s;in was owing to <HI>his</HI> follies. The&s;e thoughts almo&s;t drove him to di&s;traction. His friends were alarmed for the con&s;equences, and removed him by force from the mournful &s;cene.</P>
<P>Melcour, left to him&s;elf, &s;oon determined what &s;teps to take. He was determined not to return home, to be there expo&s;ed to a di&s;grace he was con&s;cious of not de&s;erving. He re&s;olv|ed to endeavour to improve the talents which Nature had endowed him with by travelling, till time &s;hould either obliterate the memory of this unfortunate adventure, or &s;how it in its true light. That very evening he made the proper preparations for his journey, and wrote a letter to his cou&s;in, acquainting him with his intended expedition. "Inform my uncle," he added, "of all that has happened; let him know that they wanted to compel me to be|come your murderer. He will &s;hudder at the thought. Though the&s;e barbarians, guided
<PB N="80" REF="030803_0079_0FE966B6193C76E8">
only by a fal&s;e &s;en&s;e of honour, think me un|worthy to &s;erve my king and country, he at lea&s;t will applaud the courageous efforts I have made to pre&s;erve us both from a crime. This le&s;&s;on, my dear Florival, will be of ad|vantage to you; your eyes are now opened to the conduct of your companions. Still conti|nue your regard for me; and never e&s;teem me unhappy while I pre&s;erve a place in your friend|&s;hip."</P>
<P>He &s;et out at day-break the next morning, accompanied by a &s;ingle &s;ervant. He had not gone many miles from the garri&s;on when he &s;aw a large detachment of the enemy on the point of defeating an inferior number of French troops. He could not behold his countrymen in danger of being vanqui&s;hed without burning with ardour to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Regardle&s;s of the danger of the attempt, he only li&s;tened to the call of glory; and this Melcour, who&s;e cou|rage his brother officers had pre&s;umed to que&s;|tion, flew to the field of battle, performed pro|digies of valour, took one of the enemy's co|lours, and animating his countrymen by his example, they obtained the victory.</P>
<P>The general officer who commanded the de|tachment was charmed with the bravery of the young warrior, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired to know his name. "Sir," he replied, "I will tell you who I am directly; but, will you give me leave fir&s;t to a&s;k, what is the immediate de&s;ti|nation of your detachment?" "It is going," &s;aid he, "to reinforce the neighbouring garri|&s;on," (naming that which Melcour had left,) "of which I am to take the command." "Then,
<PB N="81" REF="030803_0080_0FE966B958774288">
Sir," &s;aid Melcour, "if you will permit me, I will attend you thither, and receive there tho&s;e marks of your approbation that you &s;hall be plea&s;ed to honour me with."</P>
<P>They arrived. "Sir," &s;aid Melcour, "the only favour I a&s;k of you, is to call together the officers of the regiment of ***" (that which he had quitted); they a&s;&s;embled, and Melcour appeared. "Behold, gentlemen," &s;aid he, "the unfortunate victim of a fal&s;e ho|nour, to which you &s;acrifice every thing, though it often renders you cruel and unju&s;t. Becau&s;e I refu&s;ed to &s;tain my hands with the blood of a relation younger than my&s;elf, and who had ex|piated a very &s;light offence by the mo&s;t unequi|vocal marks of &s;orrow and repentance; becau&s;e I li&s;tened to the voice of religion and humanity; becau&s;e I re&s;pected the laws, you have judged me unworthy to carry arms in the &s;ervice of my country. Blinded by prejudice, you have dared to accu&s;e me of cowardice. For that accu&s;ation I have taken ample revenge. The&s;e colours, taken from the enemy, are a &s;uffici|ent te&s;timony of my courage." His brother officers &s;urrounded him, and embracing him, by the prai&s;es they lavi&s;hed on him, and the ex|cu&s;es they made, they atoned for the ra&s;h &s;u&s;pi|cions they had entertained of him.</P>
<P>The general, a&s;toni&s;hed and charmed with the behaviour of Melcour, pre&s;&s;ed him to re|&s;ume his rank for the pre&s;ent, till he could have an opportunity of reporting &s;o gallant an action to the mini&s;ter. Melcour yielded to his &s;olici|tations, &s;econded by tho&s;e of the officers of the regiment. "Accept," &s;aid the general, "that
<PB N="82" REF="030803_0081_0FE966BDF2D1E728">
commi&s;&s;ion you was deprived of ye&s;terday, as a tacit avowal of the inju&s;tice of that prejudice which condemned you, and may your example entirely root it out!" Then turning to the of|ficers who &s;urrounded him, he added: "Let the behaviour of this virtuous young man teach you, for the future, not to accu&s;e that per&s;on of cowardice, who, obedient to the laws of true honour, and of his country, refu&s;es to become a murderer. Renounce, gentlemen, that fatal error, which &s;hows you the man of true courage in him who is not afraid to wa&s;h out an injury in the blood of his fellow citizen: behold him rather in the per&s;on who has greatne&s;s of &s;oul to be above the de&s;ire of revenge. For the fu|ture, defer your quarrels till the day of battle, and let the conte&s;ts for &s;uperior re&s;olution be decided in the face of the enemies of your king and country. Or, if the in&s;ult offered you is amenable to the laws, let the laws fix that ignominy on your adver&s;ary that his conduct may de&s;erve. But, let your warme&s;t prai&s;es be be&s;towed on Melcour, and on tho&s;e who have the magnanimity to follow the example he has this day given us."</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the tran&s;ports of Florival during this affecting &s;cene. From that moment he renounced his fatal errors, and, &s;trictly keeping the &s;olemn promi&s;es he had made to his friend, and profiting by his exam|ple, they both were rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t &s;tati|ons in the army, which they filled with the greate&s;t honour to them&s;elves, their family, and their country.</P>

<P>EMMELINE was the daughter of a gentleman of large fortune; &s;he was always dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t elegant manner; her nur&s;ery was filled with the mo&s;t expen&s;ive toys, and &s;he had &s;e|veral &s;ervants to wait upon her. If &s;he wi&s;hed for any thing, however ab&s;urd in it&s;elf, or in|capable of plea&s;ing her when obtained, yet Emmeline mu&s;t be indulged. Not a &s;ervant in the hou&s;e was &s;uffered to contradict her, and
<PB N="84" REF="030803_0083_0FE966CB850D7CD0">
&s;ometimes, if they happened to di&s;plea&s;e her, &s;he would &s;cratch and beat them in the mo&s;t violent manner. Notwith&s;tanding her finery, and her &s;uperfluity of toys, notwith&s;tanding &s;he had every thing at her command which riches could procure, and every one was &s;triving to make her happy, &s;he was a mo&s;t mi&s;erable lit|tle girl. Her tyrannical temper made her univer&s;ally di&s;liked, even by tho&s;e who were obliged to be &s;ub&s;ervient to her, and her fret|fulne&s;s and ill humour was a con&s;tant thorn in her own bo&s;om.</P>
<P>At the entrance of her father's park &s;tood a lodge, which was inhabited by a poor man who had al&s;o one daughter. Little Jenny was one of the be&s;t tempered girls in the world; &s;he was never &s;een crying and out of humour like Emmeline, but on the contrary, was civil and obliging to every body. There was not a &s;er|vant at the hall but loved her as if &s;he had been their own child; and never did they go down to the lodge, but they were &s;ure to carry her an apple, or a piece of plum-cake, or &s;ome|thing nice in their pockets. It frequently hap|pened that Jenny was &s;ent for to play with Em|meline, which &s;he did not like at all, for the young lady was &s;o whim&s;ical it was impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e her, and frequently would de&s;ire Jenny to do what was very improper. On &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions &s;he would never comply; for though &s;he paid the haughty little girl every re&s;pect which was due to her rank, &s;he never forgot what was due to her&s;elf: well knowing that a wrong ac|tion is equally culpable, whether the per&s;on who tempts us to commit it, be poor or rich.
<PB N="85" REF="030803_0084_0FE966CD0C49C080">
If in their play they happened to break any thing, Emmeline would de&s;ire Jenny to &s;ay it was one of the &s;ervants who did it; and when &s;he refu&s;ed to be guilty of &s;o wicked an action, Emmeline would put her&s;elf in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and frequently beat her. In &s;hort it is not to be conceived how di&s;agreeable &s;he made her|&s;elf. She was al&s;o very ignorant; &s;he could neither read, nor write; for though &s;he had &s;everal ma&s;ters, not one of them attended her more than three or four le&s;&s;ons. Mrs. Gordon would not permit her to be reprimanded, and no one could long endure her unre&s;trained in&s;o|lence. She was therefore unacquainted with the mo&s;t common branches of learning, and when Jenny, who was nearly the &s;ame age, could read very well, Emmeline &s;carcely knew her letters. Jenny was one day as u&s;ual &s;ent for to the hall, and when &s;he arrived &s;he found the young lady in the parlour with her Papa and Mama, who were endeavouring to divert her by a great variety of very pretty prints, which they had &s;ent for from London. She looked at them a little time, and then being tired, to&s;&s;ed them away. Jenny took one to look at, when Emmeline &s;natching it from her, a&s;ked her how &s;he dared touch it?

<P><Q>Oh I do not know: pray don't a&s;k me &s;uch que&s;tions. Come let us go and play.</Q></P>
</SP>
<P>They went into the garden, accompanied by a &s;ervant, for Emmeline was never &s;uffered to move without one. As they were running about, Emmeline happened to fall, and &s;cratch her arm again&s;t a goo&s;eberry bu&s;h. She im|mediately began to cry and &s;hriek &s;o loud, that in a few minutes her Papa, Mama, and half the &s;ervants came running to &s;ee what was the matter. Mrs. Gordon chided the &s;ervant very much for the accident, though &s;he well knew it was in no &s;ervant's power to prevent her daugh|ter's doing what &s;he liked. Mr. Gordon took her in his arms, and carried her into the hou&s;e; but it was &s;ome hours before &s;he could be paci|fied. Such was the child, whom unbounded indulgence had totally &s;poiled, for Emmeline had not naturally bad di&s;po&s;itions. With in|crea&s;ing years, her faults increa&s;ed al&s;o, and her parents then began to &s;ee, and lament the folly of their conduct. Every plea&s;ure, every comfort of their lives were totally de&s;troyed. They could not enjoy their own home from the wretched temper of their daughter, nor were they happier when abroad, as their fears for her &s;afety were ever awake. They knew no one
<PB N="87" REF="030803_0086_0FE966D6A3C5F198">
could controul her, and that however dangerous what &s;he had a fancy for, that, &s;he would do. They were invited to &s;pend a month at a gen|tleman's &s;eat at &s;ome miles di&s;tance. Not with|out great reluctance did they accept the invita|tion; but at length it was determined Jenny &s;hould &s;tay with Emmeline during their ab|&s;ence. Poor Jenny dreaded the per&s;ecution &s;he knew &s;he mu&s;t endure, and when &s;he put on her bonnet to go to the hall, &s;he could not help crying. The fir&s;t day of her vi&s;it was &s;pent much as u&s;ual; but the &s;econd, Emmeline was if po&s;&s;ible, more ill-tempered than ever; and Jenny, tired beyond all endurance, thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed her:
<Q>Mi&s;s Emmeline, I am come here, not becau&s;e I wi&s;h it, but becau&s;e your Mama, has de&s;ired it; do not therefore think that I will be treated in this manner. I know that I am poor, and you are rich; but yet, Mi&s;s Emmeline I would not change &s;ituations with you. Of what u&s;e to you is your rank, but to enable you to torment others, and to make every one as unhappy as your&s;elf? I do not believe the poore&s;t beggar &s;uffers more than you do. You have riches, but you do not know how to enjoy them, and though you call your&s;elf great, nobody loves you.</Q></P>
<P>This was language Emmeline had never be|fore heard; &s;he would have uttered the effu&s;i|ons of her pa&s;&s;ion, but &s;hame kept her &s;ilent. She felt a &s;en&s;ation &s;he had never experienced; and inferiority wholly new. How much did this little pea&s;ant appear &s;uperior to her&s;elf? how was all her boa&s;ted con&s;equence dwindled to nothing?</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="030803_0087_0FE966DED95D8F90">Such is the power of Virtue, that even the wicked are awed by it. From that time Emme|line felt a veneration for Jenny &s;he knew not how to account for. She &s;aw how happy &s;he always appeared, how much &s;he was beloved, and in &s;hort, how different &s;he was in every re|&s;pect to her&s;elf. The&s;e reflexions fir&s;t con|vinced her of her folly, in imagining &s;he could ever be happy if &s;he was not good. She re|&s;olved to imitate the conduct &s;he could not but admire, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to become amiable. But &s;he found this a very hard ta&s;k; &s;he had not only virtues to acquire, but faults to con|quer which
<Q>had grown with her growth, and &s;trengthened with her &s;trength.</Q>
But yet, though it was difficult, it was not impo&s;&s;ible; &s;he told her re&s;olution to Jenny, who could &s;carcely contain the raptures &s;he felt at hearing this declaration; and &s;he thought Emmeline had never appeared &s;o lovely as in that moment. Her countenance was no longer clouded by frowns and tears; &s;he began to feel what hap|pine&s;s virtue can be&s;tow, and that it is &s;he alone who makes us truly great.</P>
<P>Very often did &s;he relap&s;e into her former habits, but reflexion, by pointing out their fol|ly, and experience, by &s;howing their mi&s;ery, fortified her mind to re&s;i&s;t their attacks; Jen|ny too was near, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to conquer them. Hitherto the profu&s;ion of money, which the too great indulgence of her parents had al|lowed her, had been &s;pent in cakes, &s;ugar-plums, and toys; but now, a new &s;ource of de|light was opened to her; &s;he ta&s;ted the charms of benevolence, and her bo&s;om was warmed by
<PB N="89" REF="030803_0088_0FE8AD21E43B9AB0">
the emanations of charity. The poor of the village &s;aw in her a ri&s;ing benefactre&s;s, and the widow and the orphan prayed for her happine&s;s. The &s;ervants too, whom &s;he now treated in a very different manner, re&s;pected her as much as they had before de&s;pi&s;ed her; and every one was eager to wait upon, and oblige her. As for Jenny, by who&s;e example and advice the little tyrant had been reclaimed (for it was &s;he who had taught her to pray Heaven to a&s;&s;i&s;t her good intentions) it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay with what warmth of affection &s;he loved her. Her &s;tay at the hall was no longer di&s;agreeable to her, no longer occa&s;ioned dread and unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Gordon had been per&s;uaded by their friends to extend their vi&s;it a month longer. So uncomfortable was their own home, that they agreed to it with much le&s;s reluctance than they would otherwi&s;e have done. Two months, therefore, they had been ab&s;ent, when they began to prepare for their return. The plea&s;ure they would have felt in &s;eeing Emme|line after this long ab&s;ence, was much damped by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s how ill &s;he de&s;erved their affection: yet them&s;elves only had they to blame; for her heart was good, and naturally inclined to virtue; but &s;o de&s;tructive are the con&s;equences of unre&s;trained indulgence, that human nature is vitiated by it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t glance Emmeline caught of the car|riage among the trees, her heart began to beat with unu&s;ual &s;en&s;ations. She felt the painful emotions of con&s;cious &s;hame; &s;he knew how ill &s;he had requited the tenderne&s;s of her parents, and after a &s;truggle with &s;ome few remaining
<PB N="90" REF="030803_0089_0FE966E861C779E8">
&s;parks of pride, &s;he determined to confe&s;s her faults, and entreat her parents' forgivene&s;s. As &s;oon as they entered the hou&s;e, &s;he expre&s;&s;|ed in a manner very different from her former habits, the joy &s;he felt at &s;eeing them. They cla&s;ped her to their bo&s;oms, and looked at each other in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment. They now began to di&s;play the profu&s;ion of toys, which they had brought her home, and a&s;ked her how &s;he liked them? She made no an&s;wer, but bur&s;ting into an agony of tears, threw her&s;elf on her knees before them, and declared her conduct had hi|therto made her unworthy their goodne&s;s, but &s;he would in future endeavour to de&s;erve it more.</P>
<P>Inexpre&s;&s;ible were the raptures of Mr. and Mrs. Gordon, they could not find words to de|clare their feelings, but each endeavoured to exceed the other in the mo&s;t affectionate ca|re&s;&s;es. She now con&s;tituted their happine&s;s as truly as &s;he had before been the cau&s;e of their forrow. Her bad habits had been too long in|dulged to yield to any thing but time and re|&s;olution; yet her relap&s;es were &s;hort, and the contrition &s;he felt, was her be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t their return. When her parents were informed it was to Jenny they were in a great mea&s;ure in|debted for their daughter's reformation, they determined their gratitude &s;hould equal her virtue.</P>
<P>Emmeline had very &s;oon a worthy woman provided as a governe&s;s for her, to whom &s;he was docile, obedient, and attentive; and made &s;o rapid a progre&s;s in her &s;tudies, that &s;he a&s;to|ni&s;hed all who had known her former ignorance.
<PB N="91" REF="030803_0090_0FE966E9E9BDA758">
Jenny was kept at the hall, and &s;hared in the plea&s;ure and in&s;tructions of her friend, to whom &s;he every day became dearer.</P>
<P>From this &s;tory, my little readers may learn the benign influence of Virtue. Vain are rich|es, vain the boa&s;t of power without it! They can never rai&s;e any one &s;o high as Virtue.</P>
<P>Let them con&s;ider Emmeline and Jenny. How much was the latter, though cloathed in the &s;imple&s;t manner, &s;uperior to her haughty friend, even when decked in the mo&s;t co&s;tly at|tire! Let none then de&s;pi&s;e Poverty, it is often found the re&s;idence of Virtue. Let them pay to merit what is always its due, though found in the humble&s;t walks of life. And let every one remember there is no real &s;uperiority but that of Goodne&s;s; and that it is equally the part of Wi&s;dom and Virtue, to efface the wild ine|quality, the di&s;tinctions paid alone to rank and riches, which pride and folly have introduced into the world.</P>

They divide their city into different depart|ments; lay up provi&s;ions of all kinds in their magazines, and conduct all their bu&s;ine&s;s with the greate&s;t care and regularity. They are likewi&s;e the tendere&s;t parents to their young, nur&s;e them with the greate&s;t affection, and amply &s;upply all their wants.</Q></P>

<P><Q>Really, Mama, it is very won|derful, but yet I can ea&s;ily credit it; for I re|collect a few days &s;ince, when I was walking by the honey-&s;uckle bower, I ob&s;erved a va&s;t number of ants crawling about. I &s;tood
<PB N="94" REF="030803_0093_0FE966FBA56A1060">
&s;ome time to ob&s;erve them, and I do a&s;&s;ure you I &s;aw one of them carry a part of a dead fly in its mouth.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mountain.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>That is by no means un|common with them, for they are indefatiga|ble in their labours.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>Lucretia.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>I have often heard you &s;ay Mama, how much plea&s;ure the &s;tudy of natural hi&s;|tory afforded you. Will you teach me it? I am &s;ure I &s;hould like it very much.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mountain.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>Mo&s;t readily: for there is no &s;cience which more &s;trongly di&s;plays the wi&s;dom and power of the creator. It is a &s;ci|ence which ought to teach us humility, as it &s;hows us the wonderful powers which &s;ome of the animal tribes po&s;&s;e&s;s; and as many of the&s;e are employed for our advantage, they ought to &s;ecure to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors the kinde&s;t treat|ment.</Q></P>

<P>The next morning Lucretia begged &s;ome grains of corn of one of the &s;ervants, with which &s;he immediately ha&s;tened to the &s;pot where &s;he had before &s;een the ants. She laid her trea&s;ure on the ground, and in about a quarter of an hour &s;everal of the&s;e indu&s;trious in&s;ects came to it. Their numbers &s;oon increa&s;ed; &s;he called her Mama to ob&s;erve them, who told her, &s;he had no doubt but this was nearly the whole co|lony, as it is well known the ants kept &s;pies, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to di&s;cover any thing worth ama&s;&s;ing, which was no &s;ooner done than they gave information of it, and the whole party immediately &s;allied out.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mountain and her daughter &s;tood &s;ome time to ob&s;erve the little labourers, and &s;aw
<PB N="95" REF="030803_0094_0FE966FD2BCE7270">
them take all the corn to depo&s;it it in their gran|aries. The plea&s;ure of Lucretia was very great in beholding their indu&s;try, and &s;he frequently placed corn or fruit that &s;he might ob&s;erve them carrying it away. Nor was her curio&s;ity gra|tified, nor did her re&s;earches end here. Natu|ral hi&s;tory by degrees was familiar to her; bo|tany, that repo&s;itory of wonder and plea&s;ure, &s;oon became the favorite &s;tudy of her hours of recreation. Her mind being thus enriched with u&s;eful knowledge, no vacuum was left for tho&s;e trifling amu&s;ements, which are equally a di&s;|grace to the head and heart.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who ob&s;erve the beauties of Nature, who accu&s;tom them&s;elves not merely to look at, but to &s;ee all around them, can never be at a lo&s;s for employment. Every bird that &s;kims the air, every bea&s;t that ranges the field, will fur|ni&s;h them with &s;ufficient amu&s;ement, and lead them to the contemplation of that Being who&s;e wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s are equally con&s;picuous in all that He has made.</P>
