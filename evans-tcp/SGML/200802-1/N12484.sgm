<P>THAT there is a GOD, "is the prime foundation of all religion." We &s;hould therefore employ our ut|mo&s;t diligence to e&s;tabli&s;h our minds in the &s;tedfa&s;t belief of it. For when once we have firmly &s;ettled in our minds the belief of GOD'S being, it will mightily influence all our powers of action; it will invite our hope, alarm our fear, and addre&s;s to every pa&s;&s;ion within us, that is capable of per&s;ua&s;ion, and be in us a never-failing &s;ource of devotion and religion.</P>
<P>A GOD without a providence, is a &s;olitary kind of being, and affords but gloomy apprehen&s;ions. For 'tis by his providence that all intercour&s;e be|tween GOD and his rational creatures is maintained,&mdash;therein he exerci&s;es and di&s;plays his perfections,&mdash;therein his power executes the contrivances of his wi&s;dom, and his wi&s;dom plans the methods of his goodne&s;s and grace, which open to the view and ad|miration of the wi&s;e and good, through &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages and generations.</P>
<P>BUT that branch of providence, which, in a pe|culiar manner, demands our attention on this occa|&s;ion,
<PB N="6" REF="015776_0003_0F9A295D67E40D28">
and &s;hould excite our gratitude, is GOD'S un|interrupted government of the rational part of his creation,&mdash;mankind in particular. For as all go|vernment, &s;o the <HI>divine,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es laws, and laws &s;uppo&s;e rewards and puni&s;hments, of which intelli|gences only are capable.</P>
<P>SINCE, therefore, GOD intere&s;ts him&s;elf in the affairs of mankind, and the univer&s;al admini&s;tration of his providence extends to all his works, a large field opens for the employment of our contempla|tive minds. And we are naturally led to con&s;ider this divine government, as re&s;pecting communities; the affairs whereof are important, and upon which the order and felicity of the world greatly depend.</P>
<P>GOD is the &s;overeign of the world, and di&s;po&s;es all things in the be&s;t manner. All ble&s;&s;ings and ca|lamities, of a public nature, and the revolutions of kingdoms and &s;tates, are to be viewed as under the &s;pecial direction of heaven. Hence the &s;cripture &s;aith, that GOD "increa&s;eth the nations, and de|&s;troyeth them, he enlargeth the nations, and &s;traitneth them again&mdash;&s;ometimes he ble&s;&s;eth them, &s;o that they are multiplied greatly; again, they are mini&s;h|ed, and brought low, through oppre&s;&s;ion, affliction, and &s;orrow."</P>
<P>THESE truths being nece&s;&s;arily interwoven with religion, and exten&s;ively u&s;eful under the varying &s;cenes of life, and mi&s;teries in providence&mdash;the main de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, is to awaken our at|tention to the pa&s;&s;ages of divine providence&mdash;and lead us to a religious improvement of GOD'S hand, in the tragical events that took place on the <HI>nine|teenth</HI> of April, 1775. I mean the MURDEROUS
<PB N="7" REF="015776_0004_0F9A295E2A71A578">
WAR, <HI>rapine</HI> and <HI>deva&s;tation of that day,</HI> which we are now met to commemorate.</P>
<P>UNDER this vi&s;itation, or the greate&s;t trials imagi|nable, we have abundant con&s;olation, that GOD rules in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of this earth.</P>
<P>THE words but now read, may be, perhaps, not unfitly applied to us, for comfort and encourage|ment under GOD'S cha&s;ti&s;ements, and his u&s;ual con|duct towards the enemies of his church and people:&mdash;"Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his &s;ervants, and will render vengeance to his adver&s;aries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people." The&s;e are the concluding words of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his &s;ong, which &s;etteth forth GOD'S works of mercy and judgment towards the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> his covenant people. And though, in their primary meaning, they re&s;pect that nation only, yet they may be accommodated and fairly applied to GOD'S faithful and obedient peo|ple, at all times, and in all ages; ina&s;much as the latter part of the prophecy reaches unto the latter days, and is not yet wholly fulfilled.</P>
<P>SOME interpret the former part of the ver&s;e thus,&mdash;"Rejoice ye nations, who are his people," &s;uppo|&s;ing it to be a prophecy of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> becoming one body with the people of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI>&mdash;becau&s;e <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had &s;uppo&s;ed in this &s;ong, great enmity between them, and that &s;ometimes they had &s;orely plagued <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> as at others, GOD rendered to them accord|ing to what they had done unto his people: but now breaks out in a rapture of joy, to think that they &s;hould one day be reconciled, and made one people of GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="015776_0005_0F9A29606803A318">
THE prophecy then before us, is not limited to the <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> but may be under&s;tood as extending to all GOD'S cho&s;en, though oppre&s;&s;ed and injured people, in all generations,&mdash;that he will recompen&s;e their wrongs&mdash;plead their cau&s;e&mdash;and do ju&s;tice up|on their enemies. And taking it in this latitude, we may collect &s;everal things from it, as worthy our notice, and pertinent to this occa&s;ion. Accordingly I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THAT GOD, in the righteous admini&s;tra|tions of his providence, permits the &s;ons of violence to oppre&s;s his &s;aints and people; and, in their malice and rage, to attempt their ruin, by waging war with them.</P>
<P>GOD is a being of infinite power and inflexible ju&s;tice, as well as con&s;umate wi&s;dom; and doth ac|cording to his &s;overeign plea&s;ure, in the paternal and moral world. He over-rules all things for his own glory, and in &s;ubordination to that, has a particular regard to the happine&s;s of his covenant people:&mdash;His church and cho&s;en are not without mi&s;takes and errors, in this imperfect &s;tate&mdash;hence they are prone to degenerate and tran&s;gre&s;s&mdash;to be too regardle&s;s of GOD, and deficient in their obedience&mdash;nay, to be guilty of great wickedne&s;s. And it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary, to puni&s;h &s;uch revolters from the ways of GOD, and purity of manners. Hence, when the all-wi&s;e GOD de&s;igns the cha&s;ti&s;ement and reformation of his back&s;liding people, he "vi&s;its their tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions with the rod, and their iniquity with &s;tripes,"&mdash;and u&s;es tho&s;e methods, that &s;hall be&s;t promote his moral government; inflicting this or that judgment, as plea&s;es him. The divine providence then is to be devoutly acknowledged in all events, in all pub|lic evils and calamities.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="015776_0006_0F9A296128BB4EA0">
SOMETIMES there are vi&s;ible marks of GOD's an|ger and di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t his people. Their coun|&s;els are divided, and their &s;trength impaired&mdash;their enemies are permitted to di&s;tre&s;s and injure them&mdash;or they have been harra&s;&s;ed by the will and conduct of ambitious, de&s;igning men, who have contributed to the ruin of their country, even at the &s;ame time they pretend a mighty zeal for its intere&s;t:&mdash;Or, they are &s;courged by haughty <HI>tyrants</HI> and cruel oppre&s;&s;ors:&mdash;Yet the hand of GOD, and his over-ruling provi|dence is to be acknowledged in the&s;e things, as much as when a people &s;uffer by famine, pe&s;tilence, earth|quakes, &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, &amp;c. which are com|monly regarded as the more immediate tokens of GOD's anger, and works of his providence.</P>
<P>IN all public evils, calamities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of GOD's people, <HI>He</HI> in his providence, proceeds accor|ding to equal rules, and for wi&s;e and &s;alutary purpo&s;|es. Hence the promi&s;es of temporal ble&s;&s;ings made to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in ca&s;e of their obedience to the divine commandments, and the threatnings of tempo|ral evils and plagues denounced again&s;t them, in ca&s;e of their di&s;obedience, recited in <HI>Levit.</HI> XXVI, and <HI>Deut.</HI> XXVIII chapters; related chiefly to them as a body politic, becau&s;e with regard to the public, they always took place. When religion and virtue flou|ri&s;hed among them, and they walked in obedience to the divine laws, they pro&s;pered, were &s;ucce&s;&s;ful in their wars, had great plenty, and all things conducive to their welfare and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT when they revolted from GOD, and were generally corrupt and di&s;&s;olute, they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mi&s;erable, and a prey to their jealous and en|vious neighbours. And it may be noted, in general,
<PB N="10" REF="015776_0007_0F9A2962A9CEE568">
that when public calamities were inflicted upon them, whether by the more immediate hand of Heaven, as drought, pe&s;tilence, famine, and the like; or, by in&s;tru|ments in providence, as the hands of their enemies and oppre&s;&s;ors; it was always as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for their national iniquities; their idolatry, irreligion and aboun|ding wickedne&s;s. And upon their repentance and reformation, the&s;e calamities were removed, and their pro&s;perity re&s;tored.</P>
<P>NOR was this cour&s;e of providence peculiar to the <HI>Jews.</HI> The e&s;tabli&s;hed rule of the divine procedure towards nations is a&s;certained in <HI>Jer.</HI> XVIII, 7, &amp;c. "At what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it: If that nation again&s;t whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will re|pent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.&mdash;And at what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a na|tion, and concerning a kingdom, to build, and to plant it; if it do evil in my &s;ight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I &s;aid I would benefit them."</P>
<P>WE are a&s;&s;ured, in the oracles of truth, that 'Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation; but &s;in,' i. e. aboun|ding vice and wickedne&s;s, "is a reproach to any peo|ple." And with regard to mankind in all ages, may it not be &s;aid, that when a people have been re|markable for ju&s;tice, temperance, indu&s;try, and zeal for the public good, they have pro&s;pered in all their affairs, and been high in reputation? And, perhaps, no in&s;tance can be produced of a nation's being given up to exterminating judgments and calamities, &s;o long as virtue, probity and religion flouri&s;hed among them. But when fal&s;hood and perfidy, inju&s;tice and general
<PB N="11" REF="015776_0008_0F9A2963681A76D8">
corruption, with a contempt of religion, have general|ly prevailed among them, they have fallen into many calamities, and been deprived of tho&s;e advantages they &s;o much abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>THUS GOD, in a variety of ways, may correct and puni&s;h his degenerate people; and, among others, permit enemies to oppre&s;s them, <HI>&s;hed blood</HI> in their land, and lay them wa&s;te.</P>
<P>IT by no means reflects upon the <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of GOD, that tho&s;e whom he employs as in&s;truments in the execution of his judgments upon a revolting, &s;in|ful people, are them&s;elves chargeable with inju&s;tice and cruelty; and have nothing in view but the gra|tifying their own ambition, avarice and lu&s;t of power. And commonly they who are the authors, or perpe|trators of &s;uch violence and &s;everity upon a people, are afterwards, in GOD's time, ju&s;tly puni&s;hed in their turn, for their vices, their pride, wantonne&s;s and barbarity.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, if we make a religious improve|ment of &s;uch di&s;pen&s;ations, we &s;hall re&s;olve all into the good plea&s;ure of <HI>Him,</HI> who is "higher than the highe&s;t," and has the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of all in his hands. And however unde&s;erving we may be of &s;uch unrighteous treatment from men, <HI>our fellow-mortals;</HI> yet we are to adore the great&mdash;the wi&s;e&mdash;the power|ful GOD,&mdash;humble our&s;elves under his mighty hand,&mdash;accept the puni&s;hment of our &s;ins,&mdash;learn righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,&mdash;patiently bear the indignation of the Lord, and quietly &s;ubmit to his providences; and, while his judgments are upon us, repent and reform, con|fide in his almighty power, hope in his mercy, and plead his compa&s;&s;ion and the riches of his grace, that

in his own way and time, which is the fitte&s;t, we may &s;ee his &s;alvation. Pa&s;s we, therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To ob&s;erve, the di&s;pen&s;ations of hea|ven towards <HI>oppre&s;&s;ors and tyrants,</HI> the enemies of GOD's people. "For he will avenge the blood of his &s;ervants, and will render vengeance to his adver|&s;aries,"&mdash;none &s;hall hinder his proceedings, to be fully avenged of them.</P>
<P>HE is the &s;upreme Lord, governor and judge of the world, therefore will he cha&s;ti&s;e offenders; to him belongeth vengeance,&mdash;therefore the wicked &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE enemies of GOD's church and people, are GOD's adver&s;aries. "The Lord's portion is his people,&mdash;he keeps them as the apple of his eye"&mdash;ver&s;es 9, 10, of the context. Whoever grieves or afflicts them, provokes GOD, for they are "his pe|culiar trea&s;ure." And having a &s;ingular concern for them, he will be their &s;hield and their defence, how|ever they may be per&s;ecuted by their enemies. "For the Lord &s;hall judge his people;" ver&s;e 36. i. e. plead their cau&s;e, and deliver them from the oppre&s;&s;ion of their enemies; as this phra&s;e is fre|quently u&s;ed in the book of <HI>P&s;alms.</HI> He will have mercy upon his &s;ervants, and turn his hand, which puni&s;hes them, upon their adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>THUS utter de&s;truction is denounced upon <HI>Edom,</HI> for their unnatural enmity again&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> and cruelty towards their brethren, in <HI>Obad.</HI> ver. 10, "For thy <HI>violence</HI> again&s;t thy brother <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;hame &s;hall cover thee, and thou &s;halt be cut off forever."</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="015776_0010_0F9A29650E5D8550">
To confirm our faith and hope in GOD, in trou|blous times, in days of darkne&s;s and mi&s;ery, it may be proper to look back, and devoutly contemplate that mo&s;t &s;ignal act of divine providence, that when the primitive religion which had been derived from the beginning, was in danger of being lo&s;t among men, and the world became generally involved in gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry, it plea&s;ed GOD to &s;in|gle out a nation from the re&s;t of mankind, and to erect them into a &s;acred polity, &s;et apart by their fundamental con&s;titution for the profe&s;&s;ion and wor|&s;hip, the faith and obedience of the one true GOD, in oppo&s;ition to the wor&s;hipping idols or fal&s;e dei|ties, and to the wor&s;hipping the true GOD by images. The more effectually to awaken the attention of mankind, and to give the more illu&s;trious confirma|tion to that church con&s;titution, it was wi&s;ely order|ed, that in the founding and e&s;tabli&s;hing of it, there were repeated and amazing exertions of the power of GOD.</P>
<P>AND the whole of that di&s;pen&s;ation was admira|bly &s;o contrived, as to prepare the way for a more &s;piritual and perfect &s;tate of the church, which was to &s;ucceed it, and was to be more univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed; in the founding of which, providence interpo&s;ed in a yet more remarkable manner, by a &s;eries of mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing events.</P>
<P>THROUGH the powerful influence of a wi&s;e pro|vidence, events that were de&s;igned for the de&s;truction of the church, have been made &s;ub&s;ervient to its greater &s;tability. Thus <HI>Haman'</HI>s malicious, re|vengeful plot, which threatned utter ruin to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation and religion, was mo&s;t marvellou&s;ly over-ruled to contribute to the confirmation thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="015776_0011_0F9A2965A84203D8">
LIKEWISE the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> church, though the world ever was an enemy to it, has been firmly e&s;|tabli&s;hed: It has been maintained again&s;t cruel per|&s;ecution, and the greate&s;t violence.&mdash;And though continually burning, it has not been con&s;umed,&mdash;though to&s;&s;ed with tempe&s;ts, and worried by its op|pre&s;&s;ors and adver&s;aries, frequently pa&s;&s;ing through the furnace of affliction; yet it retains a form more bright and beautiful, as of the &s;pou&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the joyful mother of children, which no man can number.</P>
<P>INDEED churches are not perfect or compleat; they are apt to decline and tran&s;gre&s;s;&mdash;nothing therefore can be more equal and fit, than that GOD &s;hould, in his holy providence, manife&s;t his righteous di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t back&s;liding churches that have fallen from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the power and purity of religion, into a &s;tate of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> happen that, in times of per&s;ecution, blood&s;hed and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ar, the church may be reduced in its members, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the remnant may become more re|fined, holy and heavenly. The faith and patience of the &s;aints be more exerci&s;ed, their zeal and piety more eminent, and practical godline&s;s more gloriou&s;ly appear. And then, in due &s;ea&s;on, GOD rai&s;eth his church and people from their afflicted and oppre&s;&s;ed &s;tate, and <HI>rendereth vengeance</HI> to their adver&s;aries and per&s;ecutors. Thus <HI>Babylon</HI> of old was puni&s;h|ed for her cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church. And thus &s;hall it likewi&s;e be in the ca&s;e of my&s;tical <HI>Babylon;</HI> which, after having been long &s;uffered to prevail, and to "make war with the &s;aints of the mo&s;t High," &s;hall have a mighty downfall, wherein the vengeance and ju&s;tice of almighty GOD,
<PB N="15" REF="015776_0012_0F9A2966694F7080">
&s;hall be illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played; of which we have a &s;triking de&s;cription in XVIII. chap. of the Revela|tion.</P>
<P>AND that we may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the faith of the prophecy before us, that GOD "will avenge the blood of his &s;ervants," and execute "vengeance up|on their adver&s;aries," we may advert to the animating promi&s;e of our ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Saviour,</HI> in the parable of the <HI>unju&s;t judge,</HI> who, neither fearing GOD nor regard|ing man, was neverthele&s;s prevailed on by the con|tinual cries of the widow, to do her ju&s;tice again&s;t her adver&s;ary; our Lord adds, <HI>And &s;hall not</HI> GOD <HI>avenge his own elect?</HI>&mdash;Will he not much more be moved to vindicate his cho&s;en and dearly beloved people, that cry to him day and night, under the cruel oppre&s;&s;ion of their in&s;ulting enemies, even though he may &s;eem to <HI>bear long with them,</HI> to give them &s;pace for repentance? I tell you, he will cer|tainly vindicate them, and when once he undertakes it, he will do it &s;peedily too." Herein, "our conde&s;cending Lord only intended to intimate, that if the repeated, importunate cries of the afflicted, may at length prevail even upon an inhuman heart, they will be much more re|garded by a righteous and merciful GOD, who is al|ways ready to be&s;tow his favours, when he &s;ees we are prepared to receive them. We may rely upon it, that GOD will vindicate his &s;aints. Let this en|courage them, though the rod of the wicked may for a while re&s;t on them&mdash;and let it intimidate the proud oppre&s;&s;ors of the earth, who, in the mid&s;t of all their pomp and power, are &s;o wretched, as to have the prayers of GOD's people again&s;t them."</P>
<P>WE have encouragement then, to hope in GOD,
<PB N="16" REF="015776_0013_0F9A296728596050">
that he will build up Zion&mdash;that he will appear &s;till for us, under all our di&s;tre&s;&s;es and oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;that he will <HI>avenge the innocent blood</HI> of our brethren, inhumanly &s;hed in the beginning of the pre&s;ent un|ju&s;t war&mdash;that he will <HI>render vengeance to his</HI> and our <HI>adver&s;aries</HI>&mdash;and one day re&s;tore tranquility to our country&mdash;that he will make our land "a quiet habitation," when we may view it in perfect peace, and free from all fears of ho&s;tile inva&s;ions. <HI>For,</HI> to u&s;e the words of the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> "The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King, he will &s;ave us." Hence we are natural|ly led, in the la&s;t place, to ob&s;erve from the conclud|ing words of my text.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion of GOD, to his penitent, praying and obedient people: "And will be merciful unto his land, and to his people."</P>
<P>THOUGH GOD cha&s;ti&s;e his people with the rod of his hand, or permit enemies to oppo&s;e and op|pre&s;s them, yet he will remember his holy covenant, and &s;hew compa&s;&s;ion to them, upon their humilia|tion and repentance. This is illu&s;trated in <HI>Neh.</HI> ix chap. wherein the <HI>Levites</HI> make a religious con|fe&s;&s;ion of GOD's goodne&s;s, and the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> wick|edne&s;s&mdash;greatly provoking GOD by their di&s;obedi|ence and rebellion again&s;t him, and contempt of his law; <HI>Therefore,</HI> as in ver&s;e 27, "Thou deliver|ed&s;t them into the hands of their enemies, who vex|ed them, and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou hearde&s;t them from hea|ven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gave&s;t them <HI>&s;aviours,</HI> who &s;aved them out of the hand of their enemies."</P>
<P>GOD will not "ca&s;t off his people, neither will he

for&s;ake his inheritance: The Lord will not ca&s;t off forever&mdash;but though he cau&s;e grief, yet will he have compa&s;&s;ion, according to the multitude of his mer|cies." He will ari&s;e, and have mercy upon <HI>Sion,</HI> when the &s;et time to favor her, is come.</P>
<P>To repre&s;ent the perpetual love of GOD to his church and people, the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> utters him|&s;elf in this rapturous &s;train, "Sing, O heaven, and be joyful, O earth, and break forth into &s;inging. O mountains, for GOD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted"&mdash;chap. XLIX. 13. And &s;peaking of their deliverance at la&s;t, &s;aith, ver. 26. "And I will feed them that oppre&s;s thee, with their own fle&s;h, and they &s;hall be drunken with their own blood, as with &s;weet wine, and all fle&s;h &s;hall know that I the Lord, am thy <HI>Saviour,</HI> and thy redeemer, the mighty one of <HI>Jacob.</HI>"</P>
<P>THE intention of GOD's &s;evere di&s;pen&s;ations be|ing not the de&s;truction of his people, but their amendment, it becomes them to acknowledge his hand, confe&s;s and for&s;ake their &s;ins, and importu|nately &s;eek to him for needed &s;alvation.&mdash;Hence, we are frequently exhorted in &s;cripture to repentance, as the &s;ure&s;t way to obtain mercy from GOD; <HI>Job</HI> v. 17. "Behold, happy is the man whom GOD cor|recteth; therefore de&s;pi&s;e not thou the cha&s;tening of the Almighty&mdash;For he maketh &s;ore, and bindeth up, he woundeth, and his hands make whole. He &s;hall deliver thee in &s;ix troubles, yea, in &s;even, there &s;hall no evil touch thee. In famine he &s;hall redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the &s;word."</P>
<P>THE corrections of his hand are the &s;courges of a faithful GOD, who retaineth not his anger forever,
<PB N="18" REF="015776_0015_0F9A2968A80266B0">
becau&s;e he delighteth in mercy. To this purpo&s;e we have a more general exhortation to repentance, in <HI>Hos.</HI> VI. I. "Come, and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath &s;mitten, and he will bind us up." The &s;ame GOD that puni&s;heth us, can only remove his judg|ments, and &s;hew us mercy. GOD will "&s;peak peace to his people, and to his &s;aints, if they return not again to folly&mdash;Surely his &s;alvation is nigh them that fear him."</P>
<P>AND the church of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution, &s;hall one day break forth as the morning, clear as the &s;un, fair as the moon, and triumph over all its potent, cruel adver&s;aries; even when the glorious things &s;poken of her, in the latter days, &s;hall be accompli&s;hed;&mdash;corre&s;ponding to the prophecy of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> chap. lx. wherein de&s;crib|ing the <HI>Jews</HI> re&s;toration from captivity, takes occa|&s;ion therefrom to repre&s;ent the glories of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> kingdom, which began upon the fir&s;t publication of the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> but will not be compleated 'till the full|ne&s;s of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> are come into the church; and faith, "Violence &s;hall no more be heard in thy land, wa&s;ting nor de&s;truction within thy borders: Thy &s;un &s;hall no more go down, neither &s;hall thy moon withdraw it&s;elf; for the Lord &s;hall be thine everla&s;ting light, and the days of thy mourning &s;hall be ended: Thy people al&s;o &s;hall all be righteous; they &s;hall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.

<P>THAT we &s;hould acknowledge the infinite pow|er of our GOD, and his &s;overeign dominion over all; and give honour and &s;ervice to none other.</P>
<P>THAT his works of providence, no le&s;s than of creation, are mo&s;t perfect; &s;ince he doth nothing without the greate&s;t rea&s;on, and according to the rules of exact ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>THESE hints might be profitably enlarged upon; but I mu&s;t leave the more particular improvement of them, to your own private meditations; and fall in clo&s;er with the de&s;ign of this <HI>anniver&s;ary,</HI> which is to keep in mind a &s;olemn remembrance of the origin of the pre&s;ent MURDEROUS WAR, and more e&s;pe|cially of the <HI>innocent blood</HI> wantonly &s;hed around this &s;acred temple; and the &s;ub&s;equent &s;laughter and de|&s;olation by <HI>Briti&s;h troops,</HI> on that memorable day, APRIL NINETEENTH, one thou&s;and, &s;even hun|dred, &s;eventy-five: A day religiou&s;ly to be regarded by all profe&s;&s;ed <HI>chri&s;tians.</HI></P>

<P>WITH compa&s;&s;ion and tender &s;ympathy, we renew the &s;orrow and lamentation of the <HI>bereaved,</HI> for their decea&s;ed friends and relatives, who then fell a &s;acri|fice, bled and died, in the cau&s;e of GOD and their country, by the &s;ons of violence, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of mur|derers,&mdash;as multitudes have fallen <HI>&s;ince</HI> in our land,&mdash;who&s;e blood we hope in GOD, he will &s;peedily and righteou&s;ly avenge, and re&s;tore peace and tran|quility.</P>

<P>IN pur&s;uance of their oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures (if not intentionally to begin the barbarous and bloody &s;cene) the enemy came upon us like a flood, &s;tealing a march from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> through by-ways, under the darkne&s;s and &s;ilence of the night; and like <HI>cowards</HI> and <HI>rob|bers,</HI> attacked us altogether defencele&s;s; and cruelly murdered the <HI>innocent,</HI> the aged and helple&s;s.

<P>WITH a&s;toni&s;hment and gratitude we recollect the kindne&s;s of our almighthy Pre&s;erver, that no more were &s;lain by the hand of violence; and that the

people willingly offered them&s;elves to <HI>the help of the Lord again&s;t the mighty,</HI> who manfully oppo&s;ed the efforts of Briti&s;h pride, power and barbarity.&mdash;The hand of GOD was vi&s;ible in the&s;e things; and the power and goodne&s;s of GOD manife&s;ted in our de|liverance, from the enraged, di&s;appointed enemy, is to be devoutly retained in memory, and thankful|ly acknowledged. When we con&s;ider, how weak and unprepared we were at that time, for &s;uch a &s;udden a&s;&s;ault, (though the behaviour of the <HI>Briti&s;h troops</HI> might have led us to expect ho&s;tile mea&s;ures would en&s;ue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Witne&s;s their numerous in&s;ults to the inhabitants of town and country:&mdash;And their warlike preparations, and formidable fortifications on Bo&s;ton-Neck, and at the entrance of the town, erected <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>)</NOTE> we may, not unfitly, adopt the words of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> concerning the church of old; in <HI>Ps.</HI> 124, whererein &s;he ble&s;&s;eth GOD for a miraculous deliverance from a formidable enemy; I &s;ay we may apply the words in the beginning of the <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> to our&s;elves and circum&s;tances, with a little variation; "If it had not been the Lord, who was on our &s;ide, now may <HI>New-England</HI> &s;ay: If it had not been the Lord, who was on our &s;ide, when men ro&s;e up again&s;t us; then they had &s;wallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled again&s;t us," and be|gan to break out in fiercene&s;s:&mdash;In their furious rage they would have &s;uddenly devoured us, and laid wa&s;te the country.</P>
