<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR and his WRITINGS.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is probable that this Collection of Poems may fall into the hands of some who are unacquainted with what were the circumstances of the Author, it may not be improper to annex a short Account of him; which, perhaps, may not only gratify the curiosity of such, but assist them in forming a judgment of his natural talent for poetry.</P>
<P>Mr. THOMAS GODFREY, the Author of the following Poems, was born in Philadelphia, in the year 1736. His Father, who was of the same name, was a Glazier by trade, and likewise a Citizen of Philadelphia. A person, whose great natural capacity for Mathe|matics, has occasioned his name to be known in the learned world: being (as has been heretofore shewn by undeniable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Authors of the American Magazine for July and August 1758, have taken much generous pains to do justice to old Mr. GODFREY'S memory, and have published an original letter of his to the Royal Society, which does not appear to have been taken any notice of in their transactions, and also two letters of JAMES LOGAN, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which fully prove that the first invention of this Quadrant was undoubtedly Mr. GODFREY'S; and that he had formed his plan of it as early as the year 1730. <Q>How he came to be deprived of the honour of this invention (say the writers in the Magazine) may be made a question by some. We answer, that Mr. GODFREY sent the instrument to be tried at sea, by an acquaintance of his, an ingenious navigator, in a voyage to Jamaica, who shewed it to a Captain of a ship (said to be a relation of Mr. HADLEY'S) just going to England; by which means it came to the knowledge of Mr. HADLEY, tho', perhaps, without his being told the name of the real inventor. This fact is sufficiently known to sundry seamen and others, yet alive in Philadelphia</Q></P>
<P>In short, after publishing the above-mentioned letters, together with Mr. GODFREY'S first draught of his <HI>Octant,</HI> or <HI>Quadrant</HI> commonly so called, they conclude thus, <Q>For our part, we have no hesitation in pronouncing Mr. GODFREY the real and original inventor of this famous and useful instrument.</Q> At the same time they speak with great respect of Mr. HADLEY, acknowledging, <Q>That tho' there was sufficient reason to conclude he was not the first inventor of this instrument, yet he had great merit in the improvement of it, and that his fame in the learned world could suffer no diminution from the justice done to Mr. GOD|FREY, of whose name, perhaps, he had never been told.</Q></P></NOTE> evidences) the original and real inventor of the very useful and famous Sea-Quadrant which has been called HADLEY'S.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="009983_0003_0F7B7964FB2C02A0">
He died when his Son was very young, and left him to the care of his Relations, by whom he was placed to an English school, and there received<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">All the quotations, relative to the Author of these Poems, are taken from the account published in the American Magazine.</NOTE> <Q>a common education in his mother tongue; and with|out any other advantage than <HI>that,</HI> a natural genius, and an atten|tive perusal of the works of our English Poets, he soon exhibited to the world the strongest proofs of poetical capacity.</Q></P>
<P>It is not to be wondered, therefore, that in the early period of life, he should feel such a warm impulse for those elegant arts for which nature had formed him. For, besides having a fine ear for Music, and an eager propensity to Poetry, we are told, that, when very young, he discovered a strong inclination to Painting, and was very desirous of being bred to that profession. <Q>But those who had
<PB N="v" REF="009983_0004_0F7B7965A8EAEE08">
the charge of him, not having the same honourable idea either of the profession or its utility which he had, crossed him in that desire. After some time he was put to a Watch-maker, an ingenious man, in this city, but still the muses and graces, poetry and painting stole his attention.</Q> He devoted therefore all his private hours to the cultivation of his parts, and toward the expiration of his time he composed those performances that were published, with so much fa|vourable notice, in the American Magazine.</P>
<P>At length he quitted the business of watch-making, and got himself recommended to a Lieutenant's commission in the Pennsylvania forces, raised in the year 1758, for the expedition against Fort Du Quesne; in which station he continued till the campaign was over, when the Provincial troops were disbanded.</P>
<P>The succeeding spring he had an offer made him of being settled as a factor in North-Carolina, and, being unemployed, he accepted of the proposal, and presently embarked for that place, where he con|tinued upwards of three years. At Carolina it was, that he finished the Dramatic Poem, called, <HI>The Prince of Parthia,</HI> as appears by a letter of his, to a Gentleman in this city; dated, as early as, Novem|ber 17th, 1759; which was received after the manuscript of it. "By the last vessel from this place," says he, "I sent you the copy of a Tragedy I finished here, and desired your interest in bringing it on the stage; I have not yet heard of the vessel's arrival, and believe if she is safe, it will be too late for the Company now in Philadelphia."&mdash;So that he was but about twenty-two years of age when this dramatic piece was completed.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="009983_0005_0F7B796659E50F10">
Mr. GODFREY, on the death of his employer, left Carolina, and returned to Philadelphia; but finding nothing offer, that was advan|tageous, at his return here, he determined to make another voyage abroad; and, accordingly, procured some small commissions, and went, as a super-cargo, to the Island of New-Providence, where he was for some months, but met with no great encouragment. From New-Providence, (led, as it were, by some sad fatality) he sailed, once more, to North-Carolina. Where in a few weeks after his ar|rival, he was unexpectedly summoned to pay the debt of nature, and death put a sudden stop to his earthly wanderings, by hurrying him, off this shadowy state, into a boundless eternity.&mdash;</P>
<P>He happened, one very hot day, to take a ride into the Country, and, not being much used to this exercise, and of a corpulent habit of body, it was imagined the heat overcame him; for the night fol|lowing he was seized with a violent vomiting and malignant fever; which continued seven or eight days, and at 10 o'Clock, A. M. on the third of August, 1763; put a period to his life, in the 27th year of his age.</P>
<P>Thus hastily was snatch'd off, in the prime of manhood, this very promising genius, beloved, and lamented, by all who knew him. What is here presented to the public, is a collection of those sweet effusions which flowed with a noble wildness from his elevated soul. Free and unpremeditated he sung, unskill'd in any precepts, but what were infused into him by nature, his divine tutoress. The Public must judge, whether, from these youthful emanations he does not ap|pear to have been animated with the genuine poetic flame.&mdash;But whatever desert he may be allowed as a Poet, it will be render'd still
<PB N="vii" REF="009983_0006_0F7B796A65F018E0">
conspicious by his character as a man. His sweet amiable disposition, his integrity of heart, his engaging modesty and diffidence of manners, his fervent and disinterested love for his friends, endeared him to all those who shared his acquaintance, and have stamped the image of him, in indelible characters, on the hearts of his more intimate friends.</P>
<P>Mr. GODFREY was first made known to the public by the learned Authors of the American Magazine; who seemed pleased in having an opportunity to acquaint the world with his modest merit, and of doing all the justice in their power, both to our Author, and his Father also, as was observ'd above. <Q>Nature, say they, seems not to have designed the Father for a greater Mathematician, than she has the son for a Poet. The former, was, perhaps, one of the most singular Phaenomena that ever appeared in the learned world. For without the least advantages of education, almost intuitively, and in a manner entirely his own, he had made himself master of the abstrusest parts of Mathematics and Astronomy. Just so it is with the Son.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>The first of our Author's pieces that was published in the Magazine was, the <HI>Invitation,</HI> with the following note: "This little poem was sent to us by an unknown hand, and seems dated as an original; if it be so, we think it does honour to our city." A little while after, an <HI>Ode</HI> on <HI>Friendship,</HI> an <HI>Ode</HI> on <HI>Wine,</HI> and a <HI>Night-Piece</HI> of our Au|thor, made their appearance in the same periodical work. The <HI>Ode</HI> on <HI>Wine,</HI> say the Authors, "is wrote with much poetic warmth." "These pieces" continue they, <Q>and some others of his, fell into our hands by accident, soon after the appearance of the <HI>Invitation,</HI> which was found among the rest; and we reckon it one of the highest instances of good fortune that has befallen us, during
<PB N="viii" REF="009983_0007_0F7B796B1FD66400">
the period of our Magazine: that we have had an opportunity of making known to the world so much merit, we mean in considera|tion of his circumstances and means of improvement.</Q> These de|tached pieces made his name known, and gained him a considerable deal of credit; they were reprinted sometime after in the English Magazines.</P>
<P>In the year 1762 was published <HI>The Court of Fancy.</HI> The Authors of the Magazine, it seems, had seen it before it was finished; for we find this favourable account of it in their literary compilement. <Q>What will place him high in the lists of <HI>Poets</HI> (when it shall have re|ceived his last hand) is a Poem of considerable length called <HI>The Court of Fancy;</HI> in managing which he shines in all the spirit of true creative Poetry.</Q></P>
<P>The next year after this, made its appearance in the Pennsylvania Gazette, that nervous and noble song of triumph called <HI>Victory,</HI> which was the last of our Author's pieces that was published.</P>
<P>The editor will not presume to anticipate the judgment of the public on those other pieces in this collection, which now make their first appearance in print; were it, indeed, proper for him, the strong passion which he bore to the person of the Author, and still extends to his memory, has, he acknowledges, precluded him from being a suit|able judge of the merit of these Poems.</P>
<P>He would only beg leave, therefore, to remark of the Tragedy of the <HI>Prince of Parthia</HI>&mdash;That it is the first essay which our Province, or perhaps this Continent, has, as yet, publicly exhibited of Dramatic Composition&mdash;and, that there is possibly some merit even in endea|vouring to overcome noble difficulties, though we should happen to aspire after a flight beyond our years.
<Q><L>In great attempts 'tis glorious e'en to fall.</L></Q>
<PB N="ix" REF="009983_0008_0F7B796BA6545CD8">
The Author's youth, when this piece was composed, his disadvan|tages in respect of education, the desultory life he was compelled to lead&mdash;and, the arduous nature of the task&mdash;all conspire to cast a veil over every fault, and to heighten every grace and beauty, which the judicious reader may perceive in perusing it; and induce him to con|clude that, even as it stands, it is no inconsiderable effort towards one of the sublimest species of Poetry, and no mean instance of the Author's strong inherent genius, unaided as he was by the rules of instruction.</P>
<P>After what has been said, should any little inaccuracies appear in this collection, it cannot be doubted, but the generous critic, will fa|vour them with an indulgent eye&mdash;Instead of halting at a verbal error, he will be pleased to see natural genius struggling over all obstacles, and soaring, by starts, into the brightest tracts of Poesy. What might we not have expected, from these fair promises of our Author, had he arrived to a season of maturity? More<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The reader may, perhaps, observe that some of Mr. GODFREY'S later performances, are not quite so correct as some of his earlier pieces, publish'd in this collection. The reason is, that before the publication of the latter, he always submitted them to some of his judicious friends, who made several corrections in the diction, grammar and placing the accents; in which last Article having no rule but his own ear, he is sometimes faulty in his posthumous and more un|finished pieces. Some of these blemishes the Editor has endeavoured to amend; some he finds have still escaped his notice, for want of due time, from other necessary engagements, to attend to a more thorough revisal of the sheets; and some others he thought it would be taking too great liberty to meddle with. The Reader will, perhaps, not blame him for this when he finds, by the <HI>Postscript,</HI> that it was occasioned by the fine and ingenious remarks of one of the first pens among us.</P>
<P>The several Pieces in the Magazine, passed to the Public thro' the hands of the Gentleman who has done the Publisher the honour to favour him with his comment on these Poems; and who drew up the Account both of the Father and Son in the Magazine; concluding his Account of the latter with the following generous and moving expressions&mdash;"We hope," says he, <Q>our readers will not think this Account too particular, when we are endeavouring to do that justice to the genius of a Son of THOMAS GODFREY, which his own genius never had while it could be of service to him.</Q></P>
<P>Young Mr. GODFREY always retained the most grateful sense of favours confered on him, and particularly of the kind notice taken of his Juvenile Pieces by this Gentleman, as well as the share he took in recommending him to a commission in the Provincial service.</P>
<P>About this time also, the same Gentleman, from the pleasure that attends the introducing rising merit into the world, took an opportunity of making known the name of Mr. WEST; almost literally foretelling, in the following remarkable paragraph, the universal fame which that celebrated <HI>Painter</HI> has since acquired in <HI>Italy,</HI> and is daily acquiring in <HI>England,</HI> perhaps, beyond any other person of his profession of the present age.</P>
<P>Speaking of a small Poem on a Lady's portrait, the Writer says&mdash;<Q>We communicate it with particular pleasure, as the <HI>Lady</HI> who sat, the <HI>Printer</HI> who guided the pencil, and the <HI>Poet</HI> who so well describes the whole, are all <HI>Natives</HI> of this Province. We are glad of an opportunity of making known to the world the name of so extraordinary a genius as Mr. WEST. He was born in Chester County in this Province, and without the assistance of any Master, has acquired such a delicacy and correctness of expression in his paintings, joined to such a laudable thirst of improvement, that we are persuaded, when he shall have more experience and proper opportunities of viewing the works of able masters, he will become truly emi|nent in his profession.</Q>&mdash;Thus we find that this Gentleman's conclusions were drawn from an exact and intelligent observance of the vigorous faculties of these natural genius's; and had our Poet lived, to have received equal advantages in his way, no doubt he would have verified all that his aforesaid friend predicted of him.</P></NOTE> especially had he been nurtured by the fostering hand of art?&mdash;For surely in these first fruits,
<PB N="x" REF="009983_0009_0F7B796CC6DFC400">
which are but as the buddings of his genius, are apparent the seeds of that <HI>vivida vis animi,</HI> which has always characterized the <HI>Poet;</HI> and, in this light, it is hoped they will be received by a candid reader, notwithstanding there may be found in them some trivial faults: for as Mr. POPE judiciously sings,&mdash;
<Q><L>A perfect judge will read each work of wit</L>
<L>With the same spirit that its Author writ,</L>
<L>Survey the <HI>Whole,</HI> nor seek slight faults to find</L>
<L>Where nature moves and rapture warms the mind;&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. GODFREY and his Father, we apprehend, may be ranked among the <HI>natural curiosities</HI> of Pennsylvania; for tho' neither of them had much of human learning, yet by the peculiar felicity of their natural endow|ments, each of them were enabled, tho' in different ways, to raise themselves to honour in the learned world. It would, therefore, be
<PB N="xi" REF="009983_0010_0F7B796E0E2EF758">
matter of great concernment should such singular genius's "neglected bloom and neglected die," without any friendly hand to transmit their names to posterity. Nor let any one think that the soul is ener|vated by a love for the polite arts&mdash;no;
<Q><L>The Muse's track, where e'er she roves,</L>
<L>Glory pursue, and gen'rous shame,</L>
<L>Th' unconquerable mind, and freedom's holy flame.</L>
<BIBL>GREY.</BIBL></Q>
A late Writer excellently observes, that it is doing some service to human Society, <HI>to amuse innocently;</HI> and they know very little of human nature, who think it can b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ar to be a ways employed either in the exercise of its duties, or in high and important meditations&mdash;Those arts, therefore, that instruct as well as en<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ert<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">in <HI>innocently,</HI> surely, in some measure, de|serve our attention; and they who excel in them, the notice of the Public. Considered purely in a political sense, the works of genius are, of all others, the cheapest entertainments. Never was there a state, however barbarous and ignorant, that did not glory in her men of ingenuity; and such were never wanting in any state, where proper incitements were offered for study and labour.</P>
<P>Our Author's death happening so soon after he arrived to man's estate, has occasioned but sew anecdotes worthy to be remarked, in this short account of him. A relation of the most material, the Publisher has endeavoured, with as much brevity as possible, to present to the view of the reader; neither did the Author's sudden exit from the stage of life, admit of any leisure to think of his Poetry. The manuscript pieces, therefore, were left in their primitive form, and they fortunately fal|ling into the hands of a Gentleman, a friend of the Author, at the place where he died, were kindly transmitted to this City. The present pub|lication was undertaken at the motion, and under the countenance of
<PB N="xii" REF="009983_0011_0F7B796EF3675CE0">
some Gentlemen here, of incontestable taste and judgment. The sense the editor has of his own inabilities and inexperience, would have long enough prevented him from venturing on such a task, had he ex|pected any other hand would have offered. But he finds that friendship can excite to difficulties, though the object of its flame is translated in|to another state of existence; and a desire to please the <HI>Worthy,</HI> prevail, even to the exposing one's self to the sentence of the public. In clas|sing the several pieces, he has studied to place them in such a manner as might yield the best entertainment to the reader, and to suppress those, which, he thought, were not proper for publication&mdash;And far be it from him, to repent of the trouble he has had in revising, and transcribing for the Press these posthumous Poems of his friend, when he finds sundry of the first names among us, for virtue, learning and po|liteness, in his list of subscribers. Happy shall he think himself, if what he has done shall be approved of by those, who have done him the honour to encourage this Work! and thrice happy, if, in this attempt to commemorate his friend, he shall please those, under whose more immediate patronage he would shelter himself, and whose plaudit he prefers as the most valuable reward!</P>
<P>He begs leave to return his thanks to those gentlemen who have been assistant in promoting the subscriptions, and forwarding this undertak|ing, which, being entered on from the most disinterested views, he was the more readily emboldened to apply to his friends for their aid.</P>
<P>And now it only remains for him to bespeak the candour of the public in behalf of this collection, which, as it is the first of the kind that this Province has produced, and the last legacy of one of her youthful sons, the editor cannot doubt, that it will be received with that good-nature and abatement of rigour, which the Editor's early years alone can justify him in hoping, will be extended to himself.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IN a note to the foregoing Account, it was observed that some of Mr. GODFREY'S Posthumous Pieces are less finished than his earlier performances; and the reader will not wonder at this when he considers the sudden manner in which it pleased the Supreme Wisdom to call him from this earthly stage. It is probable too, as he left his pieces in various hands, and some of them were frequently transcribed, that several mistakes might have been made this way. The Publisher when he first entered on this undertaking, intended to have corrected every thing of this kind according to his best judgment, and as it might have been presumed the Author would have done, if he had been spared to a longer life. But as it has been observed, the Editor's attention being called off to pursuits of another nature, he was obliged to relax in that design, and in consulting one of Mr. GODFREY'S friends, on whose judgment he always had the strongest reliance, it occasioned, in some places, his remitting this intention. The reasons that prevailed on him are contained in the following Letter; and if it proves as satisfactory to the reader, as it was to him, there will be no further apology wanted for the present form in which these Juvenile Pieces, of our much lamented Author, now appear.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is greatly to your credit, that the warm friendship, which subsisted between the late Mr. GODFREY and you, is affectionately extended to his memory, and has induced you to undertake the labour of collecting his Posthumous Pieces to be publish'd in one volume, with those more corrected and finished Performances, which made their appearance in his life-time, after passing thro' the hands of some of his friends, whose judgment he esteemed. You tell me, you have been inform'd, that the Authors of the Monthly Review, in England, have not given a very high character of the "COURT OF FANCY," which we had considered as one of Mr. GODFREY'S capital performances; and you ask whether it might not be proper to make such corrections in his posthumous Works, especially the "Prince of Parthia," as the Author himself, if now alive, would thankfully accept from his friends; par|ticularly in regard to his Pointing, and the Accentuation of some of his words and classical names?</P>
<P>As to what is said in the <HI>Review,</HI> it would not displease you, if you had seen it. The judgment given of Mr. Godfrey's <HI>poetical abilities,</HI> by the Authors of that work, who had seen only a few of his performances, does not differ much from that of his warmest and most indulgent friends, who have seen the whole. <Q>Mr. Godfrey (say the Authors) possesses a considerable degree of poetical imagination, but little learning, as appears from his improper accentuation of classical names</Q> They mention the Pieces in the American Magazine, which first procured him his poetical reputation; and add that&mdash;<Q>they remember, to have since
<PB N="xiv" REF="009983_0013_0F7B7971B030C6D8">
seen a pretty Poem of his (meaning his Piece call'd "VICTORY") on the suc|cess of the British Arms in America.</Q> <Q>He certainly has <HI>genius;</HI> and we are sorry he had not education to improve it.</Q> This is their conclusion, and the substance of what they say; in which Mr. Godfrey's friends will join with them. But as want of learning was his misfortune, not his fault, the noble efforts of his natural genius deserve the greater praise; and this the Reviewers confess by saying <Q>They wish well to learning in the Colonies, and would not discourage any efforts that way, by the rigour of criticism.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis kind not to <HI>discourage,</HI> but it is still more kind positively to <HI>encourage;</HI> and it were to be wish'd that the Reviewers had found room to give some examples of our Author's strong <HI>imagination</HI> and <HI>picturesque</HI> genius from the "Court of Fancy." The following might have been chosen among many others. After describing the Temple of <HI>Fancy,</HI> he gives this grand description of the Goddess <HI>Fancy</HI> herself.</P>
<LG>
<L>" High in the midst, rais'd on her <HI>rolling</HI> throne,</L>
<L>" Sublimely eminent, bright <HI>Fancy</HI> shone, &amp;c.</L>
<L>" A radiant bough, ensign of her command,</L>
<L>" Of polish'd gold, wav'd in her lily hand&mdash;</L>
<L>" In silver traces, fix'd unto her car</L>
<L>" Four snowy Swans, proud of th' imperial Fair,</L>
<L>" Wing'd lightly on: each, in gay beauty drest,</L>
<L>" Smooth'd the soft plumage that adorn'd her breast;</L>
<L>" Sacred to her the lucent chariot drew&mdash;</L>
<L>" Or whither wildly thro' the air she flew,</L>
<L>" Or whither to the dreary shades of night,</L>
<L>" Oppress'd with gloom, she downwards bends her flight,&mdash;</L>
<L>" Or proud aspiring, sought the blest abodes,</L>
<L>" And boldly shot among th' astonish'd Gods."&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>I need not hint to you the propriety of all this Painting "Fancy mounted sub|limely on a <HI>rolling</HI> throne" "snowy Swans" whirling her car, with winged speed, whithersoever she pleases; in which our Author was no doubt animated by those beauti|ful lines of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> in the motto to his performance&mdash;
<Q><L>The Poet's eve, in a fine frenzy rolling,</L>
<L>Doth glance from Heaven to Earth, from Earth to Heaven!</L></Q></P>
<P>I have, for brevity, omitted several lines in our Author's description of <HI>Fancy</HI> herself; but the following lines, where he makes the <HI>Muses Graces</HI> and <HI>Loves,</HI> with their true offspring, <HI>Poetry, Painting</HI> and <HI>Music,</HI> to be the attendants on <HI>Fancy,</HI> in the characters of the three great ancient masters, <HI>Homer, Apelles,</HI> and <HI>Timotheus</HI>&mdash;these lines, I say, are conceived with such classical propriety, and express'd with such laconic elegance, that they well deserve notice.</P>
<LG>
<PB N="xv" REF="009983_0014_0F7B79725C391900">
<L>" On her right hand, appear'd the joyful <HI>Nine,</HI></L>
<L>" And on her left, the <HI>Graces</HI> all-divine;</L>
<L>" Young infant-<HI>Love,</HI> soft, on her breast reclin'd,</L>
<L>" And with his Mother's glowing beauty shin'd.</L>
<L>" Her fav'rite Sons were rang'd in order round,</L>
<L>" In three bright bands, with deathless laurel crown'd;</L>
<L>" Great <HI>Homer,</HI> here enjoy'd superior day,</L>
<L>" Illuminated by bright Fancy's ray;</L>
<L>" <HI>Apelles,</HI> there, whose magic hand could give</L>
<L>" Form to the mass, and bid the <HI>Fiction</HI> live;</L>
<L>" <HI>Timotheus</HI> next, whose animated lyre,</L>
<L>" Cold Grief could charm, and thoughtless Rage inspire."&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>POPE himself would not have thought the best of his writings dishonor'd by such nervous, well-imagin'd and harmonious lines as these. Nor is the humble place, which our Author has given himself, among the attendants of <HI>Fancy,</HI> less to be admir'd for the modesty and delicate beauty of the thought&mdash;
<Q><L>Close at her FEET, a Bard, in raptures lost,</L>
<L>Was plac'd, and wildly round his eye-balls tost&mdash;</L>
<L>Great <HI>Fancy</HI> was his theme! the soothing strain,</L>
<L>In floods of pleasure, thrill'd thro' every vein&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>His address to <HI>Fancy</HI> is very beautiful, and also his following apology for intruding into her court&mdash;
<Q><L>With lowly reverence I hither came,</L>
<L>Not to deride, but to adore thy name;</L>

<L>And hail thy glories, 'midst this suppliant throng&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>He then represents the Goddess as indulgent to his prayer, in the following rap|turous lines&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;Here, mortal! take this lyre,</L>
<L>Strike bold the strings, and sing as I inspire.</L>
<L>Humbly I bow'd, her mild commands obey'd,</L>
<L>And careless o'er the lyre my fingers laid;</L>

<L>All my frame shook, and lab'ring heav'd my breast.</L></Q></P>
<P>His chusing "Zephyr" as the messenger of <HI>Fancy,</HI> and his various descriptions on this head, could arise only from true poetic genius. His Account of the AEgyptian <HI>superstitions,</HI> the Heathen worship, &amp;c. shews great reading in the ancient mythology

From the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Fancy</HI> he makes a sudden transition to the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Delusion,</HI>&mdash;where&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;Within confin'd</L>
<L>Gay Fictions lurk, and Dreams of every kind&mdash;</L>
<L>Drest by her hand, they shine with mimic bloom,</L>
<L>Or, at her word, their <HI>Nothingness</HI> resume.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The word "Nothingness" is peculiarly expressive in this line. Under this head, the airy schemes of Ambition, thirst of Power, Superstition, Jealousy, Avarice, false Honour, false Affectation of Learning, &amp;c. are described&mdash;I shall only quote a few lines, out of several pages.</P>
<LG>
<L>" Others, more bold, majestic 'portments take,</L>
<L>" And plague, delighted, those who dream awake.</L>
<L>" Such are the dreams of those who thirst for power,</L>
<L>" The superstitious, and a thousand more.</L>
<L>" Others usurp the features of the dead,</L>
<L>" And shake the torch around the murd'rer's bed;</L>
<L>" Affright the vigil, or in wanton mirth,</L>
<L>" Make fools seek hidden treasure in the earth."&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>Our <HI>Virtuoso</HI> and butter-fly men are well ridicul'd in what follows&mdash;
<Q><L>The next to her approach'd a reverend dame,</L>
<L>In trophies <HI>great,</HI> from <HI>Insects</HI> torn, she came.</L>
<L>With stately step she trod the plain along,</L>
<L>And threw her treasure 'mid th' admiring throng.</L>
<L>Forward with joy, each curious mortal sprang,</L>
<L>This caught a gaudy wing, and that a pointed fang.</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Moral</HI> of his conclusion is excellent&mdash;
<Q><L>As thus I onward mov'd with wand'ring pace,</L>
<L>And view'd the varied wonders of the place;</L>
<L>Just Heaven, I cry'd, Oh! give me to restrain,</L>
<L><HI>Imagination</HI> with a steady rein!</L>
<L>Tho' oft she leads thro' <HI>Pleasure</HI>'s flowery ways,</L>
<L>In <HI>Error</HI>'s thorny path she sometimes strays.</L>
<L>Let me my hours with solid <HI>Judgment</HI> spend,</L>
<L>Nor to <HI>Delusion</HI>'s airy dreams attend;</L>
<L>By REASON guided, we shall only know</L>
<L>Those heavenly joys which FANCY can bestow.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus you see I have not altered my judgment of this Poem. There is a proper
<PB N="xviii" REF="009983_0017_0F7B797499FEA1F0">
poetical spirit supported thro' the whole; and but few places where I think it could be amended. Many beautiful passages might be selected from his other Pieces; such as the Character of General <HI>Wolfe,</HI> Pastoral 3. The <HI>Garden-Description</HI> in the <HI>Assembly</HI> of <HI>Birds,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>I come now to the question you ask,&mdash;<Q>Whether it might not be proper to make such corrections in Mr. Godfrey's posthumous Pieces, as he himself, if alive, would thankfully accept from his friends?</Q></P>
<P>In answer to this I would observe, that such corrections and alterations as were made in Mr. Godfrey's Pieces in his life-time, upon hints from his friends, and with the approbation of his own judgment, were thereby rendered his own. Sometimes he would insert such corrections, as they were offered to him; and othertimes substitute something in their stead, better than his own first thoughts, or the amendments pro|pos'd by his friends. It was in this last method, by improving on the criticisms and remarks of every judicious friend, that the writings of Pope and some of our greatest Poets, appeared so elegantly nervous and correct.</P>
<P>No doubt, sundry corrections are wanted in some of Mr. Godfrey's posthumous Pieces, and especially in the Prince of <HI>Parthia;</HI> I will mention a few. In Pastoral 1st, tho' he has sometimes accented the word <HI>"Alexis"</HI> right, and seems to have known the proper pronunciation of it&mdash;yet in the following couplet which occurs thrice, he has occasionally placed the accent wrong&mdash;
<Q><L>Droop, droop ye groves; ye plains, in silence mourn,</L>
<L>Let nought be gay, 'til <HI>Alexis</HI> return&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>It might be amended various ways&mdash;
<Q><L>Droop, droop ye groves, and all ye plains be dumb,</L>
<L>Let nought be joyful 'til <HI>Alexis</HI> come.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Or preserving the first rhime, and leaving out the name <HI>Alexis</HI> which is not material, being in the couplet immediately preceeding&mdash;
<Q><L>Droop, droop ye groves, ye fields, in silence mourn,</L>
<L>Let nought be joyful till the Swain's return.</L></Q></P>
<P>Or preserving the name&mdash;
<Q><L><HI>Alexis</HI> gone! be dumb, each grove and plain,</L>
<L>Let nought be joyful, 'till I see my Swain.</L></Q></P>
<P>So in the same Pastoral, the word "lay" is not English, but the couplet may be amended with the smallest alteration&mdash;
<Q><L>Here by my side, my pipe shall useless <HI>lay,</HI></L>
<L>Unheeded now Alexis is away.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="009983_0018_0F7B7977A847FB30">
To be corrected thus:
<Q><L>Here by my side, my pipe shall useless lie,</L>
<L>Unheeded now Alexis is not nigh.</L></Q></P>
<P>In this couplet, it is to be observed, that Mr. Godfrey places the accent on Alexis right.</P>
<P>In Pastoral 2d, are these lines&mdash;
<Q><L>Witness, ye groves, and <HI>eke,</HI> ye powers divine,</L>
<L>How oft <HI>she</HI>'s sworn her faithless heart was mine.</L>
<L>Now, fir'd by female pride, she scorns the truth,</L>
<L>And gives to wealthy <HI>Ageon</HI> her youth.</L>
<L>He's rich in num'rous flocks, scarce knows his store,</L>
<L>My love is all, nor can I boast of more.</L></Q></P>
<P>What is faulty in these lines, proceeds from unnecessary elisions, the obsolete word "eke" and the spelling the classical name wrong; for I do not at present remember any such name as <HI>Ageon,</HI> and if there be such a one, it is here wrong accented. The smallest alteration amends the whole;
<Q><L>Witness ye groves, and all ye powers divine,</L>
<L>How oft she swore her saithless heart was mine.</L>
<L>Now, fir'd by female pride, she scorns the truth,</L>
<L>And to the rich <HI>AEgaeon</HI> gives her youth.</L>
<L>Of numerous flocks the swain scarce knows his store,</L>
<L>My love is all, nor can I boast of more.</L></Q></P>
<P>A few lines afterwards he places the accent differently on the same word "Ageon;" which shews that, in his first hasty draughts, he did not even stay so far to attend to these lesser matters, as to make one part consistent with another.</P>
<P>There is the same fault in placing the name "Amphion" a few stanzas below, which a small transposition amends.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Tragedy,</HI> it is evidently very unfinished, especially in the last act; and nothing but that fondness which every Author has for a performance when it comes first from his pen, would have made him propose it for the stage. But as he knew the Company was about to break up, and he might not soon have another opportunity of trying his success this way, he was willing to offer it; and as the present elisions and unfinished lines, would not have been perceived from the mouth of the Actors, he would have had leisure before the publication to correct every thing which he might have found faulty, in the diction and measure. As to the sentiments, they are gene|rally noble, and worthy of the subject; and in respect to the plan, it would not be just to enquire whether the <HI>Unities</HI> of the <HI>Drama</HI> be all rigidly observed by a youth,
<PB N="xx" REF="009983_0019_0F7B79790A7093B0">
who, perhaps, never heard of the rules of <HI>Horace,</HI> or the <HI>Stagyrite;</HI> yet our Author's own peculiar Genius, and ideas of Propriety, have help'd him surprizingly out, in this matter.</P>
<P>The same oversights which I have taken notice of in some of the Pastorals, like|wise occur in this Tragedy.
<Q><L>What pleasure, <HI>Phraates,</HI> must swell his bosom,</L>
<L>To see the prostrate nation all around him,</L>
<L>And know <HI>he</HI>'s made them happy! to hear them</L>
<L>Tease the Gods to shower their blessings on him?</L></Q></P>
<P>For which, might be read as follows&mdash;
<Q><L>What joy, <HI>Phraates,</HI> must expand his bosom,</L>
<L>To see the prostrate nation all around him,</L>
<L>Made happy by his virtues! and to hear them</L>
<L>Weary the Gods to show'r their blessings on him?</L></Q></P>
<P>In the two first of the three following lines, there are bad grammar, and bad ac|centuation.</P>
<LG>
<L>" While shame and rout <HI>disperses</HI> all her sons,</L>
<L>" Barzaphernes pursues the fugitives,</L>
<L>The few whom fav'ring night redeem'd from slaughter."</L>
</LG>
<P>They might be alter'd thus&mdash;
<Q><L>While shame and rout disperse her hapless sons;</L>
<L>Bold Barzaphernes seeks, with vengeful arm,</L>
<L>The few whom fav'ring night redeem'd from slaughter.</L></Q></P>
<P>A little lower we have these lines&mdash;
<Q><L>Arsaces heard,</L>
<L>And thro' the swelling waves he rush'd to save</L>
<L>His drowning brother, and gave him life;</L>
<L>And for the boon the ingrate pays him hate.&mdash;</L></Q>
where the 3d line wants a syllable, and there is a disagreeable jingle in the others. They might run thus&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;Arsaces heard,</L>
<L>And rushing, instant, thro' th' opposing tide</L>
<L>To save his sinking brother, gave him life,</L>
<L>Who for the boon ignobly pays him hate.</L></Q></P>
<P>I could easily send you more examples of corrections that might be made in this and Mr. Godfrey's other Posthumous Pieces, which you put into my hands; but I
<PB N="xxi" REF="009983_0020_0F7B79791D7F9708">
am fully persuaded that it will be safer for you, and perhaps more acceptable to many readers, to lay these remains of Mr. Godfrey before the Public, in their genuine ori|ginal state, than venture on any material alterations, which might not after all be alike agreeable to every body; and perhaps in some cases be for the worse. For instance, in the following line&mdash;
<Q><L>Still in intricate mazes round I run&mdash;</L></Q>
the accent on the word "intricate" is wrong; and a person desirous to place it right and make the line smooth, would correct it thus&mdash;
<Q><L>In mazes intricate still round I run&mdash;</L></Q>
But I could not advise such an alteration as this; for it may probably have been the Author's intention in this line to make the sound an echo to the sense; and if so, the intricacy of the line, and difficulty of the pronunciation, with the two <HI>in</HI>'s joined to|gether, are sufficiently expressive of the subject.</P>
<P>To offer smaller corrections of this kind, might be the work of any hand; but to reach the heights to which our Poet has arrived in many parts of his writings, and of this Tragedy itself, is the lot of but a few.</P>
<P>How strongly is the following curse express'd!
<Q><L>O may he never know a father's fondness,</L>
<L>Or know it to his sorrow! may his hopes</L>
<L>Of joy be cut like mine, and his short life</L>
<L>Be one continued tempest&mdash;if he lives,</L>
<L>Let him be curst with jealousy and fear&mdash;</L>
<L>May tort'ring Hope present the flowing cup,</L>
<L>Then hasty, snatch it from his eager thirst,</L>
<L>And when he dies, base treachery be the means.</L></Q></P>
<P>As a contrast to the <HI>fierce passions</HI> in the preceeding lines, may be quoted the fol|lowing humane sentiments.
<Q><L>O 'tis a heavenly virtue, when the heart</L>
<L>Can feel the sorrows of another's bosom!</L>
<L>It dignifies the man. The stupid wretch</L>
<L>Who knows not this sensation, is an image,</L>
<L>And wants the feeling to make up a life</L></Q></P>
<P>I shall add but one quotation more from this Tragedy&mdash;
<Q><L>How shall I thank you, ye bright glorious Beings!</L>
<L>Shall I in humble adoration bow,</L>
<L>Or fill the earth with your resounding praise?</L>
<L><PB N="xxii" REF="009983_0021_0F7B7979DAC10790">
No, this I leave so noisy hypocrites&mdash;</L>
<L>A mortal's tongue disgraces such a theme.</L>
<L>But heaven delights where silent gratitude</L>
<L>Mounts each aspiring thought to its bright throne,</L>
<L>Nor leaves to language aught: words may indeed</L>
<L>From man to man their several wants express,</L>
<L>Heaven asks the purer incense of the heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole, I persuade myself that, the severest critic, looking over smaller matters, will allow these writings of Mr. Godfrey, to be aptly characteriz'd, in the following lines from the Court of Fancy&mdash;
<Q><L>Bold Fancy's hand th' amazing pile uprears,</L>
<L>In every part stupendous skill appears;</L>
<L>In beautiful disorder, yet compleat,</L>
<L>The structure shines irregularly great.</L></Q></P>
<CLOSER>I am, <SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Yours, &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<L>Join in my grief, and aid th' elegiac song.</L>

<L>And, ah! that heart the seat of truth before,</L>
<L>With friendship's sacred fires shall beat no more:</L>
<L>Black-rob'd oblivion's baleful wing outspread,</L>
<L>Shrouds his lov'd form, and ev'ry charm is fled.</L>
<L>His sable reign the tyrant whelms o'er-all,</L>
<L>Thus the proud perish, thus the virtuous fall!</L>
<L>As silver streams in easy mazes glide,</L>
<L>And to the main in tribute roll their tide,</L>
<L>Or bursting flames in curling volumes rise</L>
