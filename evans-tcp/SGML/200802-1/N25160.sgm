<P>THE perfection of a government will not &s;ave it from the evils of faction and party &s;pirit. The divine government it&s;elf has long had its oppo&s;ers. Immediately after its introduction on earth, as we learn from the book of Gene&s;is, the chief of tho&s;e rebellious &s;pirits, who by a re&s;t|le&s;s ambition had rai&s;ed a war in heaven, vi&s;ited the new creation, to &s;ow &s;edition, and divide its happy inhabitants from their allegiance. He cho&s;e the &s;erpent for his craftine&s;s and &s;ubtilty, as the fitte&s;t in&s;trument to &s;catter the poi&s;on of &s;eduction, and to thwart the de&s;igns of wi&s;dom. A temptation, mo&s;t dangerous and alluring to man in his exalted and happy &s;tate, was propounded to the mo&s;t &s;u&s;cepti|tible
<PB N="6" REF="033348_0005_0FF6D011F73A88D8">
of the family of paradi&s;e. To artful intima|tions that they were unrea&s;onably abridged in hap|pine&s;s, and held in ignorance by the tyranny of their Creator, were added the enticing promi&s;es of encrea&s;ed freedom, the enlargement of knowledge, and &s;en&s;itive plea&s;ure. The temptation was fatal|ly &s;ucce&s;sful, and a rebellion hence aro&s;e again&s;t God on earth, that has raged with awful virulence for almo&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and years. It called forth the &s;trong arm of power in the flood; on Sodom and its neighbouring cities; in Egypt and at the Red Sea, on a leader that arrogantly que&s;tioned, "Who is the Lord that I &s;hould obey his voice;" and a|gain&s;t Korah and his accomplices, who dared to &s;ay to Mo&s;es and Aaron, the accredited mini&s;ters of a polity ordained by God him&s;elf, "Ye take too much upon your&s;elves, and wherefore lift ye up your&s;elves above the congregation of the Lord." The &s;ame re&s;tle&s;s and ungovernable &s;pirit, rai&s;ed the Jews again&s;t the prophets, to put them to death; it brought the Saviour of men to the cro&s;s, and per&s;ecuted his followers, until the divine gov|ernment, in ju&s;tice to it&s;elf, &s;ent an army to &s;ack Je|ru&s;alem, and to di&s;per&s;e a wicked, a &s;tiff-necked, and a gain&s;aying people to all the winds of heaven. What it has done in later ages, may be learned from the encrim&s;oned page of hi&s;tory, and &s;een in every apartment of the mighty Bedlam, the great Lazar|hou&s;e

of man: Of man naturally anarchial, di&s;or|ganized, and &s;educed by the promi&s;e of the father of lies, "Ye &s;hall be as gods."</P>
<P>AS one object will be kept in view in the follow|ing di&s;cour&s;e, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cant on the excellency of one form of government above a|nother; it is enough for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that this truth be acknowledged, that faction is, and has been, the lot of every government. The govern|ment of kings and nobles has its evils and dangers, which I need not repeat, as they have been the theme of the friends and foes of real liberty. And enthu&s;ia&s;tic theori&s;ts alone will a&s;&s;ert, that elective governments can be &s;o pure in their principles, and &s;o perfect in their admini&s;tration, as to be perfectly &s;ecure from turbulence and in&s;urrection. "As heaven's be&s;t beams turn vinegar more four," we mu&s;t acknowledge, however degrading it may be to the human character, that faction has thriven mo&s;t in the milde&s;t governments; and that republics in particular, have been proverbially &s;tormy and tem|pe&s;tuous.</P>
<P>IF it is a&s;&s;erted by re&s;pectable authority, that, "It is yet in experiment whether human nature can bear &s;o free a government as our own;" he is not the enemy of liberty and of the people who would meet
<PB N="8" REF="033348_0007_0FF6D0168C1579B0">
its difficulties, but he who would &s;edulou&s;ly conceal and keep them out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>THIS is my apology for &s;electing a pa&s;&s;age of holy writ, that may lead to matter &s;o unu&s;ual on this an|niver&s;ary occa&s;ion. It is a religious duty that we owe to our good government, to be armed again&s;t the&s;e wiles of faction, the&s;e "depths of Satan;" wiles, grown common by frequent repetition; but &s;o flow of heart are men to under&s;tand, that they are until this day little con&s;idered by the great body of mankind.</P>
<P>DIVINE in&s;piration informs us, that the Jewi&s;h nation, during the reign of David, were pro&s;perous and happy. When he died it is recorded of him, "that he died in a good old age, full of days, rich|es, and honors." The &s;ame truth is al&s;o apparent from many pa&s;&s;ages in the P&s;alms, in which, the glories of Chri&s;t's future kingdom are undoubted|ly &s;hadowed forth, in the real pro&s;perity of I&s;rael, under the wi&s;e admini&s;tration of the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e: "Out of Zion the perfection of beauty hath &s;hone." It plea&s;ed God, however, for a particular &s;in of David, to &s;end into his family the &s;courge of dome&s;tic di&s;cord. An unhappy event took place that awoke, and called into action, the wor&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions, in Ab&s;a|lom the king's &s;on, the pa&s;&s;ion of revenge. With
<PB N="9" REF="033348_0008_0FF6D018F6946598">
a temper &s;oured by an incident, well known to all who read the word of God, he was &s;oon the cau&s;e of &s;erious trouble to his father, and the people he governed. When the viler pa&s;&s;ions are once rou&s;|ed in the human heart, it is with difficulty they are laid. Chagrin, and di&s;appointment, ea&s;ily agree to acts of de&s;peration. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of per&s;onal accom|pli&s;hments, and the arts of addre&s;s, young Ab&s;alom a&s;pired at no le&s;s than the dethroning of his father, and u&s;urping the government. To obtain the&s;e, he went through the u&s;ual proce&s;s of every dema|gogue, and in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the favour of the people. As parade and novelty are plea&s;ing to the great body of mankind, "he prepared him chari|ots and hor&s;es, and fifty men to run before him:" An e&s;&s;ay at &s;how, borrowed from the wicked heath|en nations, as unu&s;ual as it was unlawful in I&s;rael. But a cu&s;tom being unu&s;ual and unlawful, is of|ten alone &s;ufficient to recommend it to a race of creatures, who&s;e "hearts are continually &s;et in them to do evil." To admini&s;ter ju&s;tice between man and man, in a great nation, is an Herculean ta&s;k. It &s;eems at this time that the judiciary de|partment of his father's government, was unu&s;ually crowded with bu&s;ine&s;s, and as it is ea&s;ier to fault, than to mend the mea&s;ures of our rulers, this fur|ni&s;hed a favourable opportunity to an unprincipled and a&s;piring young man. "He ro&s;e up early and
<PB N="10" REF="033348_0009_0FF6D018F6946598">
&s;tood be&s;ide the way of the gate, and it was &s;o, that when any man that had a controver&s;y, came to the king for judgment, then Ab&s;alom called unto him and &s;aid, of what city art thou? and he &s;aid, thy &s;ervant is of one of the tribes of I&s;rael. And Ab|&s;alom &s;aid unto him, See, thy matters are good and right, but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee. Ab&s;alom &s;aid moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any &s;uit or cau&s;e might come unto me, and I would do him ju&s;tice! And it was &s;o, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obei&s;ance, he put forth his hand and took him and ki&s;&s;ed him. And on this manner did Ab&s;alom to all I&s;rael that came to the king for judgment. So Ab&s;alom &s;tole the hearts of the men of I&s;rael." The avenues to the human heart are numerous, with which de&s;igning men mo&s;t commonly are pretty thoroughly acquainted. As men have refined in manners, they have refined in villainy. The &s;tate of manners with the Jews in this age, was comparatively rude; &s;uch open &s;olicit|ation might now give offence. So bare a hook, might now be un&s;ucce&s;sful in the popular &s;tream. But the e&s;&s;entials of matter and manner in this bu|&s;ine&s;s have ever been &s;imilar, and have rarely failed, when adapted to the ta&s;te and bia&s;&s;es of a people. By "the way of the gate," we are to under&s;tand, ei|ther the entrance of the city, or the door of the court
<PB N="11" REF="033348_0010_0FF6D01DC4294EC0">
where ju&s;tice was wont to be admini&s;tred: Here he harangued the litigious, the choice&s;t materials of a demagogue. Told them that his father had be|come a child and incapable of managing his king|dom; that the judges whom he had appointed were either negligent of their duty, or corrupt, and that bribery, and not ju&s;tice, ruled in their deci&s;ions. And, that he might cover his ambition under appa|rent humanity, he was indi&s;criminately familiar with all his father's &s;ubjects. If any man had a contro|ver&s;y, let it be ju&s;t or unju&s;t, he &s;howed him&s;elf his patron and friend. On condition they would rai&s;e him to office, he not only promi&s;ed them more liber|ty, with a regular and impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and decried the neglects, wickedne&s;s, and tyranny of their lawful prince; he could de&s;cend farther, when any of the multitude did him obei|&s;ance as the king's &s;on, he proclaimed his equality, and gave them the fraternal ki&s;s. Thus he &s;tole the hearts of the men of I&s;rael, and a more proper metaphor than theft, cannot be applied to tho&s;e who &s;eek to weaken public confidence in legitimate government, to an&s;wer their own vile purpo&s;es. For the people were bound to David his father by the con&s;titution, by oaths of allegiance, and by his divine election and anointing as king.&mdash;When God in his providence is about to &s;courge a nation with &s;uch characters as Ab&s;alom, a train of inci|dents

&s;eems to be laid, to en&s;ure the accompli&s;h|ment of their purpo&s;es. It appears of a&s;toni&s;hing that a youth &s;hould &s;tir up &s;o great a portion of the peo|ple, again&s;t a king di&s;tingui&s;hed for religion, the love of his &s;ubjects, and the well earned &s;ame of many victories. But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that many of the parti&s;ans and favorites of Saul his pre|dece&s;&s;or, were &s;till living, and out of place at court, who had been in the intere&s;ts of I&s;h-bo&s;heth, Saul's &s;on, and who either were fearful of their per&s;onal &s;afety, or certainly de&s;paired of being benefited by the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE haughtine&s;s of Joab, the captain of the king's ho&s;ts, his impunity in atrocious wickedne&s;s, and his being &s;uffered to march again&s;t his fellow citi|zens, had le&s;&s;ened the character of David in the eyes of the people. Other public officers proba|bly did not excel in prudence, as a long continu|ance of power and pro&s;perity, is rarely &s;upported with dignity by the greate&s;t characters. And what was more than all the re&s;t; the &s;in of the king in the matter of Uriah, was fre&s;h in the minds of his &s;ubjects, and had a tendency to make them anxious for their deare&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and their lives. The name and infamy of Bath-&s;heba, was the topic of her &s;ex, and her power was dreaded.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="033348_0012_0FF6D02276AAB870">AS an anvenging God had laid all the&s;e circum|&s;tances in a train, the way was prepared for an ex|plo&s;ion of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, as were awoke by the conduct of Pi&s;i&s;tratus in Athens, and Tarquinius in Rome.</P>
<P>THE &s;eeds of rebellion being thus &s;own in Jeru|&s;alem, Ab&s;alom, to conceal his de&s;igns from his fa|ther, could appear religious if occa&s;ion required. With apparent filial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he reque&s;ted the lib|erty of going to Hebron, a place about &s;ixteen miles di&s;tant from the &s;eat of government, to pay a vow. Meanwhile, his creatures were di&s;patched to every part of the kingdom, who, upon an agreed &s;ignal, were to proclaim him king.</P>
<P>THE con&s;piracy &s;oon grew &s;o &s;trong, that even Ahithophel, the king's coun&s;ellor, made "precious confe&s;&s;ions" and joined it. When the intelligence arrived, that "the hearts of the men of I&s;rael were after Ab&s;alom," the court and family of the king were filled with con&s;ternation. It was re&s;olved to leave the city of Jeru&s;alem, and take refuge in the wilderne&s;s. An aged monarch flying with a rem|nant of his tried friends, before an unprincipled pa rricide mu&s;t have afforded a moving &s;pectacle. As they pa&s;&s;ed the brook Kidron, it is recorded, "that all the country wept with a loud voice.
<PB N="14" REF="033348_0013_0FF6D024D317F080">
David went up by the a&s;cent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went up barefoot, and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they wont up, weeping as they went up." The good king in his troubles did not give vent to pa&s;|&s;ionate language, or attempt &s;uicide, like an un|&s;ucce&s;sful philo&s;opher in modern revolutions. Feeling that this &s;courge was rai&s;ed up for his own, and his people's &s;ins, his heart was &s;oft and peni|tent. He pitied and forgave his enemies, and with the enlarged views of a chri&s;tian, looked up through &s;econd cau&s;es, to God the fir&s;t cau&s;e. When the prie&s;t, from attachment to their aged prince, were bearing the Ark of God in his fugitive train, that it might prove his defence, he bid them carry it back into the city, with the&s;e dignified &s;entiments. "If I &s;hall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again and &s;hew me both it, and his habitation. But if he thus &s;ay, I have no delight in thee: behold here am I, let him do to me as &s;eemeth good unto him." On being informed that his friend Ahithophel had joined the con&s;pi|rators, no terms of reproach e&s;caped from his mouth, But a mode&s;t and humble ejaculation, that "the Lord would turn the coun&s;el of Ahithophel into fooli&s;hne&s;s." The &s;ame amiable temper al&s;o marked the character of the &s;uffering and afflicted

king on his arrival at Bahurim, a village in the tribe of Benjamin. Shimei a de&s;cendant of Saul, Da|vid's predece&s;&s;or, took this occa&s;ion to expre&s;s his family antipathy, by publicly cur&s;ing the king, and ca&s;ting &s;tones and dirt. Tho&s;e who &s;tood round his royal per&s;on, felt as all natural men would feel on &s;uch an occa&s;ion: they begged the liberty to go and take off his head; "no," replied the king, "let him cur&s;e. Behold my &s;on which came forth of my bowels &s;eeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him cur&s;e, for the Lord hath bidden him." During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Ab&s;alom and his accom|plices had entered Jeru&s;alem, with the &s;houts of "God &s;ave the King." But an unprincipled man, who is ba&s;e enough to pay ob&s;equious addre&s;s to the people, that he may in this way rai&s;e him&s;elf to places of power and tru&s;t, rarely fails either to betray them, or to become licentious in his pro&s;|perity. With Ahithophel as his oracle, he imme|diately did an act, that rendered him de&s;picable in the eyes of all tho&s;e who&s;e favourite he had been. This coun&s;ellor, who&s;e wi&s;dom was literally turned into fooli&s;hne&s;s, told the young u&s;urper, that it was important to e&s;tabli&s;h it in the minds of the peo|ple, that the ancient regimen was never to return, and that he and his father were never to be recon|ciled, and that to accompli&s;h this end, it was poli|tic

to maintain a public ince&s;tuous intercour&s;e with his father's wives, and choo&s;e a &s;elect number of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, who might pur&s;ue, overtake, and di&s;patch his father and a&s;&s;ociates. The fir&s;t part of the coun&s;el plea&s;ed, and was put into execution in the &s;ight of all I&s;rael; and altho' the latter met his ap|probation, Ab&s;alom was over-per&s;uaded by another de&s;igning coun&s;ellor not to adopt it, but to gather the people, <HI>en ma&s;&s;e,</HI> and pur&s;ue his oppo&s;ers, and wipe them from the face of the earth.</P>
<P>AHITHOPHEL, &s;eeing that his coun&s;el was not ta|ken, with all the factitious dignity of a modern phi|lo&s;opher, who cannot brook contradicton, "aro&s;e, &s;addled his a&s;s, got home to his hou&s;e, and hanged him&s;elf." As the cri&s;is approached, in which the fate of the kingdom was to be decided in battle, we find our young demagogue ra&s;h, precipitate, and parricidal. But on the other hand, the king was cool, deliberate, and affectionate. With all the fa|ther in his eye and voice, he bid the commanders of his forces, to "deal gently for his &s;ake with the young man, even with Ab&s;alom." The armies encountered in the wood of Ephraim, and twenty thou&s;and men fell by the &s;word on the &s;pot, and a &s;till greater number was &s;laughtered in the retreat of the in&s;urgents. While Ab&s;alom on a mule was fleeing from his pur&s;uers, the hair of his head, of
<PB N="17" REF="033348_0016_0FF6D02BC28E5BA0">
which he had a remarkable quantity, caught in the thick boughs of an oak, "And he was taken up between the heavens and the earth, and the mule that was under him went away."</P>
<P>INTELLIGENCE of his &s;ituation was brought to Joab, the king's commander in chief, who took three &s;pears and thru&s;t them thro' his heart, "while he was yet alive in the mid&s;t of the oak." The trum|pet was blown, and the people cea&s;ed pur&s;uing. Ab&s;alom's body was taken down from the tree, thrown into a pit, and covered with an huge pile of &s;tones. "And all I&s;rael fled every one to his tent." Thus ended the life of an unprincipled, and a&s;piring young man, who &s;tole the hearts of a great people. Similar cau&s;es ever have, and ever will, produce &s;imilar effects.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of human depravity can be proved by the hi&s;tory of every nation, without the aid of the holy &s;criptures. "A di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate view of human events, affords demon&s;tration, that the fiery and de|&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ions of enmity and contention, are more congenial to the natural human heart, than the mild and benevolent &s;entiments of peace and love."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hamilton.</NOTE> All are by nature greater lovers of their own dear &s;elves, than of their neighbours, and the public good.

And as with this, temper, there cannot fail to be different intere&s;ts, and different ta&s;tes and faculties, the latent cau&s;es of faction, are the hereditary, and perpetual inheritance of mankind. That a human government &s;hould ever be &s;o con&s;tructed, as to ob|tain univer&s;al &s;upport and &s;uffrage, until God has radically and univer&s;ally changed the human heart, may be a plea&s;ant dream to a philo&s;opher, but it cannot be a reality. I hope, therefore, that I &s;hall not be &s;everely cen&s;ured, as tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on ground that does not belong to my profe&s;&s;ion, while I at|tempt to throw in my mite, to check a &s;pirit of di&s;|order and indi&s;cipline, that like a giant, &s;eems to be be&s;triding the nations, and laying pro&s;trate their government, religion, and happine&s;s. In doing this, I wi&s;h not to be thought an enemy of nece&s;&s;ary re|form, or as unfriendly to the principles of rational liberty. "There is a time to break down, and a time to build up." As the former, as it relates to government and religion, is more plea&s;ing to hu|man nature, and the latter more applicable to this country, I have; on deliberation, determined to ri&s;k the popularity of the following &s;entiments.</P>
<P>THE &s;acred &s;tory to which we have been attend|ing, may naturally lead us to con&s;ider the materials, of which factions and con&s;piracies have u&s;ually been compo&s;ed in free governments&mdash;By what methods the&s;e materials have been brought into action&mdash;

<P N="1">I. THE materials of all con&s;piracies again&s;t good government, have always been compo&s;ed of igno|rant, or wicked, &s;ubjects and citizens.

In his exile with the king of Ge&s;hur, he had learned the &s;tile of a vicious court, and the pomp of royal magnificence.

To defend, on every occa&s;ion, the &s;uppo&s;ed privileges of &s;uch characters, as were marked by the Roman orator, to embrace, not on|ly their intere&s;ts, but adopt their capricious pa&s;&s;ions, cheri&s;h their pre&s;umption, indulge their rapacity, gratify their ta&s;te for plea&s;ure without expen&s;e, and feed their antipathy to all governmental re&s;traints, is one of the grand &s;ecrets of revolutionizing. The &s;pecious ma&s;k of zeal for the rights of the people, is a favourite dre&s;s of lurking and dangerous ambi|tion, and the turbulent, and a&s;piring, always re|proach their government.

The mo&s;t popular writers on government, in this age, have taken almo&s;t the directly oppo&s;ite ground, of tho&s;e in former ages.

It is ea&s;ier to di&s;colour, and di&s;|figure, and by the dextrous arts of political legerdemain, to transform real exi&s;tences, into hydras and gorgons, than to traver&s;e the wide field of experiment.

Their coun&s;els, like tho&s;e of pandemoni|um, mu&s;t be held in that light, which in &s;cripture is called great darkne&s;s, to be &s;ucce&s;sful. In the terrible convul&s;ions, that have happened in ancient republics, and kingdoms, the true cau&s;es were rare|ly apparent to the great ma&s;s of the people, till af|ter their effects were produced. As a harpooner more ea&s;ily draws the heart's blood of the monarch of the deep, by &s;etting him a flouncing at a cork, or buoy, than by an open and direct attack, there have been few in&s;tances of &s;ucce&s;sful demagogy, where &s;ome cork, or buoy, has not been thrown out, on which the populace might flounce, and &s;pend their rage and &s;trength, until they might be taken at plea&s;ure.

<P>TAUGHT to view with awe, or admiration, tho&s;e in public &s;tations; the merit or odium of mea&s;ures, to which numerous unfore&s;een cau&s;es may have contributed, has ever been imputed to men, and not to circum&s;tances. "Party &s;pirit," &s;ays an anonymous writer, "rarely ru&s;hes to the front of the &s;tage, brandi&s;hing his bloody arm over the affrighted crowd, but he wanders behind the &s;cenes, pre&s;ents his dark lantern, aims the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inat|ing dagger, cuts the &s;inews of public confidence, and poi&s;ons the fountain of &s;ocial life." Under this head may be ranged the forging of private cor|re&s;pondencies, the fabricating of offen&s;ive anecdotes, and obnoxious innuendoes, mutilating and di&s;torting

<P N="3">3. DEMAGOGUES always humour the ta&s;te of the age. The love of pre-eminence is one of the &s;trong|e&s;t principles in man. And it is curious to trace this love in all its effects.

In the ruder ages of the world, the darling pur&s;uit of mankind, was war, military glory, and conque&s;t, and the mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful madman was the idol of the people. When heatheni&s;m was &s;wept away by the power of the chri&s;tian religion, even the innocent, and meek reli|gion of Je&s;us, became the in&s;trument to obtain pop|ular applau&s;e. The love of pre-eminence, led &s;ome to climb mountains, and build towers, on which they might &s;tand, and &s;how their extraordinary de|votion. Others &s;hut them&s;elves up in mona&s;teries, and nunneries, to evince their deadne&s;s to the world, and the nighne&s;s, in which they lived to God, or went to drive infidels from the holy land.

In another age, the &s;ame &s;pirit &s;ought a reform, and really altered many abu&s;es, but ha&s;tened into the oppo&s;ite extreme, until even reformation it&s;elf want|ed reforming. The &s;ingular revival of religion, in this country, half a century &s;ince, in which, no doubt, the &s;pirit of God was remarkably poured out, and much good accompli&s;hed, is al&s;o, illu&s;tra|tive of the &s;ame idea. Men, for pre-eminence &s;ake, were affected in their bodies, as well as their minds, &s;aw extraordinary appearances, cried out in high tran&s;ports, preached, prayed, and exhorted loud and earne&s;tly, &s;ang through the &s;treets, and were indi&s;creetly and ha&s;tily zealous. But, becau&s;e the ta&s;te and manners of the times, are altered, we are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;pirit, which led in the extravagancies of tho&s;e days, is now a&s;leep. The &s;ame love of pre-eminence, that once made zealots, and cru&s;aders, now makes &s;ceptics. Decent irreli|gion, now a&s;&s;umes to it&s;elf, the &s;ame airs, and in|dulges the &s;ame rancorous cen&s;ure. When Ab&s;a|lom would go to Hebron, to pay a vow, religion was made the &s;talking hor&s;e, and &s;acrifice, the &s;hout|ing horn, of &s;edition and u&s;urpation.</P>

There is no &s;uch commanding dignity of mind, in a man's trying to differ from his progenitors, as to government and religion, as &s;ome &s;u&s;pect.

The world probably progre&s;&s;es in knowledge; but the analogy between the natural, and intellectual &s;y&s;tems, evinces that new thoughts, are as rare as comets, and other new appearances in nature.

From the days of the &s;chool-men, to to the pre&s;ent time, a great portion of enthu&s;i|a&s;m has mixed it&s;elf with &s;cience, as well as with religion.

He was defeated in battle, and in the confu&s;ion of his retreat, his hair caught in the branches of an oak, and his mule went from under him, leaving him between the heavens and the earth. He died by the hand of violence, was thrown into a pit, and covered with a pile of &s;tones, and his followers, in the true &s;tyle of a mob, noi&s;y and tur|bulent when &s;ucce&s;sful, but mean-&s;pirited and cow|ardly in defeat, "fled every one to his tent." In like manner the great deceiver and di&s;organizer, who, "from the beginning, abode not in the truth, is to be ca&s;t into the bottomle&s;s pit, that he may de|ceive the nations no more." Altho' "he hath now great wrath, becau&s;e he knoweth that his time is &s;hort," ble&s;&s;ed be God, his chain hath an end. Tho&s;e whom he now "leads captive at his will," &s;hall turn again&s;t him, and aggravate his future con|demnation. The pride of Korah, and his accom|plices, &s;et up the holine&s;s of the congregation of I&s;rael, again&s;t its prie&s;thood, and the power of the people, again&s;t the civil magi&s;trate, altho' &s;upport|ed by a well authenticated divine commi&s;&s;ion.

The hi&s;tory of the Grecian, Roman, and French repub|licks, tho&s;e Ve&s;uviu&s;es of impa&s;&s;ioned man, to which allu&s;ions have already been made, might here be read.

Not an in&s;tance can be found, of one, who flattered and mi&s;led the people, but either he peri&s;hed in the &s;torm he had rai&s;ed, or ended in the fallacious glory of a Cea&s;ar. Indeed,</P>

We hear no more of his ki&s;&s;ing and bow|ing, or tender wi&s;hes to redre&s;s the wrongs of his in|jured fellow citizens. He forgot his ladder, grew gid|dy with its height, and fell.

under mild governments, or tho&s;e &s;imple ones that are led by the magic &s;ounds of vi&s;ionary liber|ty, have ever gained any thing by change. Both have always lo&s;t.

<P>HAVING con&s;idered the materials, of which fac|tions and con&s;piracies have u&s;ually been compo&s;ed, in free governments; by what methods they have been brought to act; and what has been the gen|eral i&s;&s;ue. Your patience is craved, while a few practical inferences are made from the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. PERSONAL accompli&s;hments, and brilliant tal|ents, are no infallible evidences, that' a man will make a good ruler. We read nothing of Ab&s;alom's wi&s;dom, virtue, or learning, in the laws of his country, or of any di&s;tingui&s;hed, di&s;intere&s;ted, and patriotic atchievement. His fir&s;t introduction in the &s;acred memoirs is on this wi&s;e; "In all I&s;|rael
<PB N="38" REF="033348_0037_0FF6D05C46A4B6D0">
there was none to be &s;o much prai&s;ed as Ab&s;a|lom for his beauty: from the &s;ole of his foot, even to the crown of his head, there was no blemi&s;h in him." Per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, and brilliant tal|ents, have in a few &s;olitary in&s;tances, made an hap|py a&s;&s;emblage with di&s;tingui&s;hed virtues. But more generally, they have been the &s;courge of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and of the world. The moment a man is con&s;cious of them, he is undone; for he immedi|ately thinks him&s;elf born to command; walks with fa&s;tidious contempt over the a&s;hes of his ance&s;tors; and growing delirious with his own &s;uppo&s;ed orig|inality, he &s;ees "luminous periods," and the "&s;plen|dors of a bright and glorious day," marching before him.</P>
<P>BUT. after all, brilliant talents have impo&s;ing charms, and will command re&s;pect, and this is not one of the le&s;&s;er evils of elective governments. In giving our &s;uffrages, we in&s;en&s;ibly forget, that a &s;ound mind &s;tored by indu&s;try, and fortified by re|ligious principles, is always the mo&s;t u&s;eful in church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>IT does not occur that belles lettres and legi&s;lation have little connection, and that popular a&s;&s;emblies have ever &s;uffered more for the want of candid, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate hearers, than da&s;hing, and impo&s;ing
<PB N="39" REF="033348_0038_0FF6D05E8C886F60">
&s;peakers. The former, commonly bear the heat and burden of the day, while the latter are rarely &s;een in their &s;eats, but on &s;ubjects, in which they can pronounce their own eulogiums to the gallery, or flatter the prejudices, and humour the ta&s;te, of the age.</P>
<P N="2">2. AND, with equal certainty, we may infer, that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t ambitious of preferment, are the lea&s;t fitted for it; as the be&s;t qualified, are the mo&s;t mode&s;t, and &s;elf-diffident. The love of honor and preferment, when kept within due bounds, may animate the patriot, and fire the hero. Still, however, more &s;acred and venerable princi|ples, than the prai&s;e of men, claim the chief direc|tion of human conduct. When the re&s;pect we pay to the opinions of men, encroaches on that reverence, which we owe to the Deity, to the voice of con&s;cience, and the &s;en&s;e of duty, it becomes criminal, and highly dangerous. The Jewi&s;h ru|lers were charged, not with loving the prai&s;e of men; but, that they loved it "more than the prai&s;e of God." When vain glory, u&s;urps the throne of a man's heart, the eye of his mind is turned from the ends, which it ought, chiefly, to keep in view, and there is no crime which he will not commit, to in&s;ure his own aggrandizement. While &s;uch a character, will &s;et him&s;elf up for &s;ale,

to do evil, virtue and worth, will never cry them|&s;elves, like courtezans, in market; they blu&s;h at the thought of &s;oliciting notice. If the &s;plendor of office, dazzles the unthinking, and unprincipled, it has, in it&s;elf, few charms to the upright, and con|templative. The freedom of retirement, was long &s;ighed for by that faithful &s;ervant of the public, who has ju&s;tly been denominated, "the father of his country." The pious, and humble, are more anxious to improve the talents they have, than to be credited with more; they connect the retribu|tions of eternity, with the u&s;e, or abu&s;e of a po&s;t of honor. Hence they are ever mode&s;t, and diffi|dent, and go into place from a &s;en&s;e of duty, rather than from the thir&s;t of di&s;tinction. And, while a&s;|piring thi&s;tles are trode down of every wild bea&s;t, the&s;e choice cedars, cleave to their native &s;oil, and,
either gloriou&s;ly keep their &s;tation in the &s;torm, or fall with all the leafy honors of the fore&s;t at their &s;ide.</P>

on all projects of change whatever. When the ca|price of innovation, and the indefinite love of polit|ical novelty, gets abroad, it always ends in blood. The milde&s;t profe&s;&s;ions and projects of reform, are, at this time, only the fir&s;t &s;teps of the &s;cale of de|&s;truction, the initiative forms of that towering fab|tic of mi&s;chief, of which they meditate in their hearts. That liberty, which has been the &s;tate pre|tence of change in free governments, has been &s;ub|ver&s;ive of all freedom: as it affords to factious leaders, a language unintelligibly impo&s;ing, and rich in the unideal terms of raving philo&s;ophy. In times of &s;editious machinations, let us cleave to our religion, and our con&s;titution, as the refuge of our hopes, as the haven and anchorage of freedom. The pre&s;ent moment calls rather for re&s;traints on licentiou&s;ne&s;s, than control of power. If we are virtuous and firm, little is to be feared from tho&s;e knots of &s;peculating politicians, who would open the flood-gates of foreign intrigue, and whelm us in the billows of tempe&s;tuous liberty.</P>
<P N="4">4. FROM the &s;triking re&s;emblance between the fir&s;t author of faction, and his &s;ubordinates, among men; we learn, that the objections again&s;t good hu|man governments, and the divine government, are the &s;ame, of cour&s;e, that the intere&s;ts of pure chri&s;|tianity, and real civil liberty, are intimately blend|ed.
<PB N="42" REF="033348_0041_0FF6D0659F4DAC00">
The grand object of the great &s;educer, is to weaken the confidence of creatures, in the Divine Executive. To make them believe, that "he is an hard and au&s;tere ma&s;ter, reaping where he has not &s;owed, and gathering where he has not &s;trawed." That he has no right, to do &s;o ab&s;olutely, "as he will with his own."</P>
<P>THAT, his governing by plan, or "fore-ordain|ing what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s," his taking the prai&s;e to him&s;elf, of their formation to good &s;ubjects, and citizens, and not leaving it to the &s;trength of their own natural principles, abridges human liberty. They think they cannot be free, while the head of government, by an exertion of power gives complex|ion to their habits, and keeps them through con|fidence in his rectitude unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THAT he errs as to what ought to be &s;upremely loved and wor&s;hipped. God declares, as he is the &s;um of public good, he has the &s;ole and unalienable right to the &s;upreme affection of his creatures, and that it is highly &s;inful in them to be&s;tow it on them|&s;elves. But creatures, mi&s;taking the habits of re|bellion, for nature and rea&s;on, lay claim to an e|qual prerogative, and affirm, that "the potter hath" not "power over the clay, to make a ve&s;&s;el" to any thing but "honor." And that they have a natural right, to &s;ay "What do&s;t thou? and, Why
<PB N="43" REF="033348_0042_0FF6D067DEAE6A78">
do&s;t thou thus?" It &s;eems a &s;tretch of power in God, to "give none account of any of his matters." And it is the united decree of all his di&s;contented &s;ubjects; "We will not have" God "to rule over us," in this imperious and &s;overeign manner.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xix. 14.</NOTE> Nay, it is carried without a di&s;&s;enting voice, by all the parti&s;ans of the father of lies, that there &s;hall be "No God:"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xiv I.</NOTE> No &s;upremely perfect, and un|alterable law; no penalties of perpetual impri&s;on|ment for men's doing as they plea&s;e; Hell, like a Ba&s;tile of de&s;poti&s;m, has public con&s;ent to be demol|i&s;hed, or be converted into a penitentiary, and all the lu&s;ts are to be manumitted by the maje&s;ty of the people. I &s;hould not dare treat the&s;e grave truths in this manner, did I not feel it to be of importance, to impre&s;s this audience with the &s;trik|ing re&s;emblance there is between the objections that are made, again&s;t that &s;y&s;tem of divine government revealed in the &s;criptures, and good human govern|ments. The popular notions of oppo&s;ing human gov|ernments, altho' in many in&s;tances ju&s;t, need not pa&s;s for any thing new, or originally pure in the heart of man. However, I hope none will con&s;true this, as evi|dencing a heart unfriendly to civil liberty. No, let every tyrant, whatever name or garb he may a&s;&s;ume, be brought to the du&s;t, and the oppre&s;&s;ed of every nation, hew the chains unnece&s;&s;arily impo&s;ed, "link from link." But let them take heed how they &s;trike

at the prerogatives of the Mo&s;t High. Contending with the Almighty, will not "in&s;truct him." And he that reproveth God, mu&s;t an&s;wer it. That which has been done by wicked men, ever &s;ince the apo&s;ta|cy, again&s;t the king of heaven, is now doing again&s;t good government. Satan, in every &s;hape, &s;till ap|pears "an angel of light," and would, if it were po&s;&s;ible, deceive the very elect. The grand object of that fungous growth of mock patrioti&s;m, which is generated and nouri&s;hed by the benevo|lent &s;un&s;hine of real liberty, has been to de&s;troy &s;y&s;tems of human good, and to arm vice again&s;t virtue, confu&s;ion again&s;t order, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s again&s;t law. To cut the nerves of whole&s;ome re|&s;traint, to bring into contempt tho&s;e, who are "mini&s;ters of God for good," to the righteous, and lead "all the world a wondering after &s;ome beast&s;" of human imagination. The materials of oppo&s;ition, the manner in which they have been brought to act, and the general i&s;&s;ue in both in|&s;tances, as it re&s;pects God, and the good ruler, al|ways have, and always will be the &s;ame. And al|tho,' "order will eventually &s;pring out of confu&s;ion, and light out of darkne&s;s;" the&s;e addre&s;&s;es to men's pa&s;&s;ions, this flattery of their prejudices, this mi&s;tating and di&s;colouring of facts, this humour|ing the ta&s;te of the age, are exclu&s;ively, tho&s;e en|gines of Apollyon, which "brought death into our

<P N="5">5. IF the divine government, and free, benevo|lent, human in&s;titutions, are &s;o connected in princi|ple and practice, if they have the &s;ame objects, and the &s;ame enemies, infidels in religion, to be con|&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, &s;hould they become the enemies of good government; and tho&s;e who pro|fe&s;s chri&s;tianity, and oppo&s;e &s;uch government, ought ju&s;tly to be numbered with infidels. For, "What concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial? or, What part hath he that believeth, with an infidel? and vice ver&s;a. Tho&s;e who oppo&s;e governments of energy, ground their theories on the innocence, and per|fectibility of human nature, on the &s;ufficiency of man's natural light, for the purpo&s;es of attaining virtue and happine&s;s, without external aid; and attribute all the ills, that have befallen men, to gov|ernment and religion. If this be true, government, that has power, is an evil, and religion, that aids &s;uch power, is a &s;courge.</P>
<P>To uphold government, while infidels at heart, and revere religion, only as an engine of civil pol|icy,
<PB N="46" REF="033348_0045_0FF6D06ECC870800">
is a &s;everer cen&s;ure of human nature, than is given in the &s;criptures. Altho' men, in the &s;acred canon, are called fools in a moral &s;en&s;e, they are never called &s;o in a natural &s;en&s;e. But the infi|del, upholding energetic government, and prai&s;ing religion, only, as its convenient bea&s;t of burden, brands the whole race as idiots, of cour&s;e, &s;aps his own favourite dignity of human nature, and the &s;ufficiency of human light. Indeed, whatever way we turn, there will be a palpable ab&s;urdity, between the love of &s;trength in government, and the hatred of religion; and the love of religion, and the ha|tred of &s;trength in government. As a &s;en&s;e of moral obligation, mu&s;t be greatly impaired before men are fitted to oppo&s;e &s;uch a government of their own making, we hence find all zealous di&s;organ|izers, &s;omewhere on that climax of error, that be|gins, in what is called, modern liberality in reli|gious &s;entiment, and ends in Athei&s;m. And, with very few exceptions, we find all tho&s;e who under|&s;tand, and embrace the religion of the fathers, or what have been called the leading doctrines of the chri&s;tian church, "obedient to the powers that are," reverencing good magi&s;trates, loving, and cleaving to their country, "for con&s;cience &s;ake." Why every infidel does not oppo&s;e a government of re&s;traints, mu&s;t be, that he either does not know its tendency, or is ignorant of his own heart, and what manner of &s;pirit it is that actuates him. He

wi&s;dom" and the God of battles. Let our hon|ourable legi&s;lators remember, that it is emphati|cally true of men in high &s;tations, that, "one &s;in|ner de&s;troyeth much good," and much depends on them, whether dignity, and influence, are to be giv|en to vice, and irreligion. Altho' the mouth of di&s;contented ambition can never be &s;topped, and the querulous tongue of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, will never re&s;t, until the grandeur of a government &s;hall be un|veiled, which will impo&s;e &s;ilence on all lips, it is important, that you "let not your good be evil &s;poken of," and give none "occa&s;ion to the enemies of the Lord, to bla&s;pheme." The cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity has been more ably argued by recent events in Europe, than it can be by the pen, or tongue of man. While infidelity has been writ|ing its inferences in blood, we mu&s;t view it as an happy omen, to this and the neighbouring States, that &s;o many young ri&s;ing characters, have been driven from the open and expo&s;ed fields of &s;cepti|ci&s;m, to the fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of moral in&s;titutions. May their &s;peculative conver&s;ion, be followed by a change of heart, and they experience tho&s;e con&s;olations in the religion of Je&s;us, which have ever proved a &s;up|port, a light, and a &s;hield to pious rulers, under the honor and dignity, as well as the &s;ufferings and re|proaches of office. As the chri&s;tian religion is the genius, the life, and &s;pirit of real liberty, and the

true foundation of national happine&s;s and greatne&s;s, let its mini&s;ters glory in their profe&s;&s;ion. If ma|ny of us are &s;traitened in temporalities, and yet re|proached as hirelings by the licentious, let us not be di&s;couraged. Patrioti&s;m, as well as love to God and men, call us to fidelity in our noble employ|ment. Liberty, exiled from Europe, cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic with our predece&s;&s;ors in office, and under their tutelage, &s;he here erected her &s;tandard. Our rulers can frame free con&s;titutions, and enact mild and whole&s;ome laws, but they mu&s;t apply to us, as in&s;truments in the hands of providence, to make whole&s;ome inhabitants, and form a free people. Sin &s;tains the glory, darkens the lu&s;tre, and de|grades the rank of rational creatures. All men, who know not the glorious "liberty of the &s;ons of God," are by nature &s;lavi&s;h, and will have a ma&s;ter. A knight-errant may &s;trike from the hands and feet of our body, the &s;hackles of de&s;potic power, or the Conqueror of Italy can &s;ay a nation is free; and yet, they may be bound in chains, which defy the &s;teel of valor to &s;ever, and the united "wi&s;dom of this world' to unloo&s;e. The chains of the &s;oul, the fetters of the mind and heart, do not melt at human touch; the Lord hath anointed us alone, to proclaim liberty to &s;uch captives, and the opening of the doors to the&s;e va&s;&s;als impri&s;oned of their &s;ins. "Seeing that many glory after the fle&s;h, I tru&s;t

<P>FINALLY, and to clo&s;e&mdash;The whole &s;ubject may with propriety be addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e who "de&s;pi&s;e government, and are not afraid to &s;peak evil of dignities." And of the&s;e, I hope, there are few in this numerous a&s;&s;emby. It is to be acknowledged, that many plau&s;ible things can be &s;aid in favor of error, and that man is, by nature, fonder of dark|ne&s;s than light. Still, can you &s;uppo&s;e, granting that you can inflate the world with the temporary phrenzy of infidel fanatici&s;m, that it will be la&s;ting; or that human nature, will of it&s;elf, lay a&s;ide a char|acter it has uniformly maintained for &s;ix thou&s;and years, of finally "turning and rending," tho&s;e who impo&s;e on its credulity. There may be coun|tries where nothing would be lo&s;t, and every thing gained by &s;ubverting and pal&s;ying the government. But no man who&s;e con&s;cience is not "&s;eared as with a hot iron," can apply this to our own. If the fir&s;t great enemy of government, and all who have followed his &s;teps, have lo&s;t them&s;elves in the mi&s;ts of enchantment they have rai&s;ed, it is worth while to count the co&s;t, before that, with indu&s;tri|ous malignancy, you attempt to rai&s;e one in this enlightened State. Should you, as Vreede and Hooffe, tho&s;e exclu&s;ive Dutch patriots, fawn like

It would be attended with not a little difficulty, to make us, like wretched Venice, the mere cents and milles of partitioning powers. If you have any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions that are dear to you, can you expect them to be inviolate, a|mid&s;t the jarring elements of univer&s;al uproar? As you may yet fail, to &s;pring up Tetrarchs and Procon&s;uls, from the a&s;hes of your humbled and divided country, and the blood of her citizens, leave that low and ba&s;e thir&s;t of fame, that craves tho&s;e honors from foreigners, which you are too vicious and too indolent to merit from your own fellow-citizens. Pray be as honorable as ambitious Cae&s;ar, who had rather be fir&s;t in a village, than &s;econd in the city of Rome&mdash;ca&s;t away the bitter leaven of party &s;pirit. "Repent of this thy wickedne&s;s" towards thy mother country, on who&s;e lap thou ha&s;t been dandled, and from who&s;e brea&s;ts thou ha&s;t drawn the &s;tamina of life; "and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.&mdash;"Now to the God of peace;"&mdash;"to the God of order, and not of confu&s;ion"&mdash;Be glory forever.</P>
