<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Heb. iii. 4.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;<HI>He that built all things is God.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Greek word <HI>(Kata&s;keu&aacute;&s;as)</HI> tran&s;lated <HI>built</HI> in our Bible, includes in its meaning the notion of <HI>order|ing and governing,</HI> and is here u&s;ed by the apo&s;tle to a&s;&s;ert the divinity of Chri&s;t, the Son of God. For if he <HI>built</HI> all things, and orders and governs them as the &s;criptures af|firm, he mu&s;t be our Creator&mdash;God emphatically&mdash;the object of our adoration and obedience.</P>
<P>IT is not however my de&s;ign to con&s;ider the text pre|ci&s;ely in this view, but to draw your attention to the great Architect of univer&s;al nature, to the order, and beauty, and ble&s;&s;ings of creation, and from thence to the obliga|tions of adoration and obedience which we owe, and ought ever to pay to our Creator, Governor, and pre&s;erver. For if we turn our mind to the contemplation of the world which we inhabit, and con&s;ider it with due atten|tion, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to &s;uppo&s;e it to have been formed by &s;ome infinitely great, and intelligent being. The na|ture of the &s;tructure &s;hews his power, the contrivance of its parts, his wi&s;dom. The diver&s;ity that appears on its &s;urface, champaign country and hills, affords fields for tillage, gives ri&s;e to rivers and brooks, and by promoting the circulation and free cour&s;e of the air, adds greatly to the &s;alubrity of that grand &s;upporter of animal life. The ve|getables with which its &s;urface is covered give plea&s;ure to
<PB N="6" REF="029480_0005_0FE13BD68BFB90E0">
the eye by their plea&s;ing variety, and by their artle&s;s, yet perfect di&s;po&s;ition; and relieve it from fatigue by their refre&s;hing verdure. To the &s;upport too of life they daily admini&s;ter by the natural and healthful &s;upply of food for man and for bea&s;t which they afford. Materials for building, and for cloathing, for fuel we al&s;o derive from the vegetable world, by which the human body is &s;ecured from &s;torms, and heat, and cold&mdash;from all the inclemen|cies of the weather.&mdash;All the&s;e things are for the u&s;e, and and conveniency of man.</P>
<P>AND &s;o are the innumerable animals &s;upported on the earth, and in the &s;ea. They all conduce to his emolu|ment or plea&s;ure. They &s;erve him for food, for cloathing for tillage, for bearing burdens, for tran&s;porting him from place to place&mdash;in a variety of ways making his life more ea&s;y and delightful to him.</P>
<P>BUT while we contemplate the earth, and find our&s;elves ble&s;&s;ed in its rich productions, can we avoid ca&s;ting our eyes on the Sun, the great in&s;trument of light and heat, and of all their plea&s;ing and happy effects, the cau&s;er of night and day, the diver&s;ifier of climes and &s;ea&s;ons, the mea&s;urer of time, the grand operator in all the productions of nature? The nightly regent of the &s;ky, the &s;plended moon, with the glittering &s;tars, and rolling planets, add to the grandeur of the cele&s;tial dome, and not only mini&s;|ter to the u&s;e and conveniency of man, but to the &s;tate and magnific<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ce of the great whole, and render fully effec|tual the united influence of all its varied parts.&mdash;<Q>The&s;e are thy works, parent of good&mdash;Almighty&mdash;thine this uni|ver&s;al frame.</Q></P>
<P>BUT to inanimate matter, and to animals, the power and goodne&s;s of God was not confined. To have built the world, and left it void of an intelligent being to behold, contemplate; and admire its beauties, to enjoy its ble&s;&s;ings, and to adore its Almighty author, the &s;ource of being and of all good, would have &s;hewn a deficiency of power or of wi&s;|dom. So did not the Supreme Architect. Man created in his own image, he placed as the inhabitant and regent
<PB N="7" REF="029480_0006_0FE13BDE3105BE60">
of his material creation. He gave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> faculties to enjoy its ble&s;&s;ings; he endued him with rea&s;on, to admire and contemplate its beauty, and order; and to lead his mind and affections up to Him; that he might adore, and prai&s;e, and obey, the Almighty author of ALL, the &s;ource of happine&s;s to every being,</P>
<P>BUT not only in this world does the creative power of God &s;hew it&s;elf, nor is man his only intelligent creature, Worlds on worlds appear to hang in the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, and probably are inhabited by beings intelligent as well as we, and po&s;&s;ibly in a far greater degree: And an|gels we know are the creatures of his hand, the mini&s;ter|ing &s;pirits that fulfil his will by executing his commands. Their nature we know not; their office divine truth hath revealed to us.</P>
<P>LOOK now at the grandeur, order, u&s;e of the various parts of the creation, e&s;pecially of this world which is mo&s;t open to our ob&s;ervation, and &s;ay, Could it be the work of blind chance? Could it have been from e|ternity and nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;ted? Could it have made it&s;elf? Blind chance could never have produced regularity, the ef|fect of de&s;ign. The con&s;tant mutability of the parts and &s;cenes of the world &s;hew that it could not have been from eternity, for what is perpetually changing cannot be eter|nal. It could not have made it&s;elf, for that &s;uppo&s;es it to have acted before it had a being; its mutability al&s;o con|futes the notion of its being nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent.</P>
<P>IT remains then that the world is the production of an infinite, Almighty Being, intelligent, good, wi&s;e, and, in every point of view, amiable beyond conception. He made all things that exi&s;t, whether animate or inanimate, brute or rational, vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible, material or &s;piritual. He built them all; be they thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, men, angels; his hand formed them; his will produced them; his word &s;poke them into being, <HI>He</HI> therefore <HI>who built all things is God.</HI></P>
<P>THIS God is a being infinite, eternal, unchangeable, without body, parts or pa&s;&s;ions; the centre and fountain
<PB N="8" REF="029480_0007_0FE13BE2D4868FF8">
of all perfections; the great Architect of all nature, the Creator, the Builder, the Framer of every thing that ex|i&s;ts; who&s;e word is power ab&s;olute; who&s;e will is wi&s;|dom, and ju&s;tice, and goodne&s;s, and mercy, and truth infinite, and incomprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>THAT God who built all things&mdash;called every thing that exi&s;ts from non-entity into being&mdash;&s;hould pre&s;erve and go|vern the creatures of his hand, is the fir&s;t dictate of nature. For what power le&s;s than that which created, can pre|&s;erve the Univer&s;e? What power le&s;s than that which built, can direct the va&s;t machine? Who pre&s;erves the &s;un, and moon, and &s;tars &s;teady and unwearied in their cour&s;e? Who commands the certain return of the various &s;ea&s;ons of the year, or the &s;weet vici&s;&s;itudes of day and night? Who di&s;pences cold and heat, clouds and &s;un&s;hine rain and dew as the various exigencies of the world re|quire, but that God who built all things, and every thing that is; and who pre&s;erves and governs them all &s;o as be&s;t to promote the benefit and happine&s;s of the whole.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to man principally was the text written. We &s;ee what ample provi&s;ion the divine munificence hath made for the &s;upport and plea&s;ure of man's body, and may we be ever thankful for it, ever prai&s;e the name of God mo&s;t high for his goodne&s;s, ever u&s;e with temperance the good things he hath provided for our &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, to his glory and our own benefit.</P>
<P>BUT remember, God who hath done all this for you, hath given you a rational, an immortal part, a &s;oul as well as a body. He breathed into the no&s;trils of the fir&s;t crea|ted man, the <HI>breath of life,</HI> and man became a <HI>living &s;oul.</HI> By the operation of this rational, intelligent &s;oul, you can be made &s;en&s;ible of the being of your Creator, of his wi&s;dom, power, goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice, truth, and of all his infinite perfections; and tho' you cannot comprehend them, you know that they mu&s;t be in him&mdash;that he cannot be without them.</P>
<P>THAT he loves you, appears from the bountiful provi|&s;ion he hath made for the happine&s;s of your body. And can
<PB N="9" REF="029480_0008_0FE13BEA1BA2CC70">
you immagine he would neglect your &s;oul? that immor|tal part which mu&s;t live forever? Would he take more care of a peri&s;hing body, that <HI>that</HI> might be delighted for a time, than of the immortal &s;oul, that <HI>that</HI> might be hap|py forever? That love which brought you into being, which built the frame of your body, which covered your bones with fle&s;h and &s;kin, which braced it with nerves and &s;inews, which made the blood to circulate thro' the ve&s;&s;els provided for it&mdash;that love framed al&s;o your &s;oul accor|ding to the model of his own image&mdash;con&s;equently for hap|pine&s;s divine with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AND that the love which brought man into being &s;till continues, appears from God's giving his only begotten Son to be his Redeemer, when he had fallen into a &s;tate of infirmity and death thro' &s;in; from the revelation of his will which He made thro' his Son by his prophets, and by his Son him&s;elf; from the laws and directions, and promi&s;es which that revelation contains, for the conduct of the life of man, both what he ought to believe and do to obtain the full favour of God; and from the ble&s;&s;ed gift of his own mo&s;t Holy Spirit, to do that in and for man which man cannot do for him&s;elf&mdash;to regenerate and renew his nature, and build it up in faith and holine&s;s, that he may become capable of that happine&s;s with his all gracious Creator for which he was originally de&s;igned.</P>
<P>HE that hath done &s;o much will a&s;&s;uredly do all things for the &s;alvation of all men, that can comport with his own infinite ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT let it be remembered that man has a will of his own, and that every man is what his will makes him to be. Since the departure of human nature from God in the de|fection of Adam, this will hath become perver&s;e, ob&s;ti|nate, ungovernable, impetuous, indi&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the will of God, in which every po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s of a rational creature mu&s;t forever con&s;i&s;t. And how far the power and ju&s;tice of God can controul this will, unle&s;s by influences, motives, per&s;uations con&s;i&s;tently with its free|dom, i. e. without de&s;troying the nature of man, and ta|king
<PB N="10" REF="029480_0009_0FE13BEF193E3FF0">
from him the freedom of choice, is hard to conceive. And if the freedom of choice be taken from him, he cea|&s;es to be a man and becomes a machine, and neither vir|tue nor vice, good nor evil can be attributed to him more than to an irrational animal; nor can he be the object of reward or puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>TO direct this will to its true end, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God and dependence on him, is the de&s;ign of all the laws and directions which God hath given to man, either by the light of rea&s;on, or the more explicit declarations of reve|lation; of all the threats and promi&s;es which God hath made to man; of all the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence; of all the motions and in&s;pirations of his Spirit.</P>
<P>IN this &s;en&s;e al&s;o is God the builder of all things; not only of the material world for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, comfort, and plea&s;ure of man, but of that &s;tate of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and holine&s;s, in which man's happine&s;s mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t; on which only it can be built.</P>
<P>IT becomes therefore nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;ubmit to the will of God in all things, that he obey every thing which God commands, and refrain from every thing which God forbids. For God being the fountain of all goodne&s;s and happine&s;s, can command or forbid his creatures nothing but what is for their advantage&mdash;e&s;pecially nothing that is un|ju&s;t in it&s;elf, or unnece&s;&s;ary to the good of the whole cre|ation.</P>
<P>ON this ground the right of private judgment is left o|pen and free to every one; for every one mu&s;t determine for him&s;elf what the will of God is&mdash;what he hath com|manded&mdash;what he hath forbidden. Only he mu&s;t take care that he judge <HI>right;</HI> for if he judge <HI>wrong,</HI> he does &s;o at his own peril&mdash;God expects he will judge according to rea|&s;on and truth; and hath given him ability and direction &s;ufficient to form a true judgment.</P>
<P>HOW far ignorance, and weakne&s;s, and prejudice will operate in favour of a man who errs in his judgment con|cerning
<PB N="11" REF="029480_0010_0FE13BF74BAC0D68">
the will of God, mu&s;t be left to him who knows the heart, and can di&s;cern the thoughts and intentions. He is merciful and ju&s;t, and will judge righteous judgment. On his goodne&s;s we depend, that he will not impute the errors of the head, to the heart, nor condemn any one for tho&s;e mi&s;takes into which he was unavoidably led, thro' ignorance, weakne&s;s, or any other un&s;urmountable ob|&s;truction.</P>
<P>A SINCERE di&s;po&s;ition however to obey the will of God, will make us very careful, that we let no vicious affection of mind, no evil propen&s;ity of heart, no undue attachment to party, no love of wealth or plea&s;ure, no &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;e or di&s;po&s;ition of any kind, weaken, or blind, or pervert our judgment where the will of God is concerned. For the&s;e things nothing can be &s;aid. He who judgeth righ|teous judgment will condemn them; and we mu&s;t endure the penalty of our own perver&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>SINCE then God, the builder of all things, built the world&mdash;the univer&s;e&mdash;things vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible&mdash;all or|ders and ranks of beings&mdash;that his glory might &s;hine forth in the happine&s;s of his creatures&mdash;Since &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will, the being entirely and ab&s;olutely what he wills us to be, is the only &s;ure foundation for perfect happine&s;s, let us remember that God who built all things hath built them in perfect order and ju&s;t proportion, and be induced from that con&s;ideration ever to conduct our&s;elves according to the due order of our own nature, and in ju&s;t proportion to the &s;tate of our being.</P>
<P>BEHOLD the order of the material creation, and thence take a le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction. He who built all things in ju&s;t order and proportion, to pre&s;erve that order which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed, appointed the great law of gravitation, and by his Almighty <HI>&s;iat</HI> it effectually an&s;wers his purpo&s;e to this very day. The word of the Supreme Architect, the grand ma&s;ter builder of the univer&s;e, is the word of power. Va|rious, and to the human eye contradictory are the motions of the heavenly bodies, and of the different parts of this globe which we inhabit. We &s;ee not how every thing a|mid
<PB N="12" REF="029480_0011_0FE13BFBE24B8E68">
&s;uch progre&s;&s;ive and retrograde-motions, pre&s;erves its order and place, nor where the the apparently wild confu|&s;ion ends. By the law of gravitation, every motion is performed, every movement made without error, and with|out injury, from the revolutions of the heavenly bodies of enormous &s;ize, down to the nouri&s;hment of the meane&s;t vegetable, and probably of the highe&s;t animal.</P>
<P>WHAT attraction or gravitation is in the natural, that <HI>love</HI> is in the moral world. Both are appointed by the great author of nature; by him who built all things, an|imate and inanimate; and both would &s;urely an&s;wer the end for which they were appointed, was it not for the per|ver&s;ity of the human will.</P>
<P>THE material creation hath no will of its own, and therefore it obeys the will of its great builder, and an&s;wers the purpo&s;e for which it was intended. But God gave man an own will, and rea&s;on to direct it. <Q>He made him upright, but they have &s;ought out many inventions;</Q> and among their other experiments, the effort to &s;ecure happine&s;s to them&s;elves, by pur&s;uing the dictates of their own will, independant on the will of their maker who built all things, hath a&s;&s;ailed and beguiled them. Hence the &s;ame or &s;imilar di&s;orders have ari&s;en among them, as would ari&s;e in the material world, &s;hould the whole cre|ation break the bounds and proportions &s;et them by their creator, and run counter to his de&s;ign in their formation.</P>
<P>HAPPILY, he who built them &s;uperintends them, go|verns their motions, and gives them ability to perform his will; and &s;till they obediently fulfil his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT man hath forgotten the great law of his moral na|ture, the law of <HI>love;</HI> and by departing from the will of his maker in per&s;uit of his own inventions, hath filled the world with evils de&s;tructive of his happine&s;s, and almo&s;t of his pre&s;ent being&mdash;with war; and blood&s;hed, and murder, and treachery, and backbiting, and &s;lander, and defamation, and every evil work.</P>
<P>TO be convinced that the&s;e things do de&s;troy the peace
<PB N="13" REF="029480_0012_0FE13C023A81E7C0">
and happine&s;s of man in the world, look at their effects&mdash;behold the mi&s;chiefs they produce. Who can be &s;ecure where the tongue or pen of the &s;landerer prevails? where the be&s;t actions are converted into the foule&s;t crimes, and a&s;cribed to the vile&s;t motives? who can re&s;t in peace where hou&s;e breaking and robbery prevail? and would you know the horrible effects of war and civil di&s;&s;entions, look at the pre&s;ent di&s;tracted condition of Europe&mdash;look, and tremble at the horrible view&mdash;look, and rejoice, and ble&s;s God that your own country is at pre&s;ent exempt from tho&s;e dire|ful calamities&mdash;look, and pray earne&s;tly to him that he would graciou&s;ly pre&s;erve you in &s;ecurity, and di&s;po&s;e the nations of the world to be at peace with you&mdash;look, and a&s;k your&s;elves this one que&s;tion, from whence proceed the evils of ill neighbour-hood? the de&s;tructions wrought by deceitful and villainous men? the deva&s;tations of tyranny and war?&mdash;From the want of that <HI>love</HI> which God hath in&s;tituted to be the grand cement of the brother-hood of men.&mdash;the operating principle by which the whole human race were to have been kept in unity and concord, even as the law of gravitation pervades and keeps in order the whole material creation. And no other way can infatuated man return to the enjoyment of happine&s;s but by returning o|bediently to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of the great Architect of all things, and living in love with his brethren. Peace is the happy fruit of love, &amp; quietne&s;s and &s;ecurity of peace.</P>
<P>"FROM whence come wars and fightings"? a&s;ks St. James, <Q>Come they not hence, even of your lu&s;ts that war in your members?</Q> Men lu&s;t after, and covet what does not belong to them; what is the property of others; and others will not quietly part with what is, or what they think is their own. War therefore is general|ly, I wi&s;h I was warranted to &s;ay, not always founded in inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>AGAINST inju&s;tice of every kind, the utmo&s;t art of man can contrive no &s;ecurity equal to that which our holy reli|gion hath in&s;tituted&mdash;<Q>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>LOVE being the grand principle ordained by the author
<PB N="14" REF="029480_0013_0FE13C078BDDEB08">
of nature to pre&s;erve peace and order among men; being too the principle which pervades Chri&s;t's religion, and on which all its morality is founded, &s;hews &s;trongly that Chri&s;t's religion came from the &s;ame &s;ource, from which &s;orung the nature of man&mdash;from him who built all things.</P>
<P>HUMAN laws reach only the outward actions of men. They can command only the hands and the feet, and god make them obey. But they take no hold of the con|&s;cience. The laws of God can alone reach that inward principle of right and wrong; for as he only knows the thoughts and de&s;igns, he only can command them. He gave to man the principle of benevolence and love, and that principle alone can regulate the conduct of man &s;o as to make him a mild and placid being. Dive&s;t him of it, and he becomes ferocious in the extreme. Compared to him wolves and tygers are harmele&s;s animals. The rea&s;on which his maker endued him to direct his conduct, and make his benevolent propen&s;ities of the highe&s;t u&s;e, being perverted from its true object and pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice of pride and malice, enables him to pur&s;ue their dictates with the cruelty and ferocity of demons&mdash;with the de&s;tructive violence of accur&s;ed &s;pirits.&mdash;Nothing which this world affords can illu&s;trate its nature, or exemplify the horrid operations of its maleyolence. Single victims of the hu|man race are too &s;mall to &s;atiate its vengeance. It de|mands multitudes, whole nations to glut its fury: and then laments the weakne&s;s of nature that could carry it no further in the horrid road of de&s;truction and revenge than to kill the body.</P>
<P>FROM this hateful object&mdash;the human heart filled with pride, inflamed by malice, and directed by rea&s;on and cunning&mdash;turn your attention to the &s;ame human heart ble&s;&s;ed and &s;oftened by the divine &s;pirit of love and good will; directed by the &s;ame rea&s;on, only illuminated and refined by the gracious in&s;pirations of the Almighty, the ble&s;&s;ed influence of the Holy Spirit who is love&mdash;infinite, unbounded love.</P>

he is rendered incapable of injuring his neighbour: For whoever willingly injured tho&s;e whom he loved? <Q>If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the &s;cripture, thou &s;hall love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf,</Q> &s;aid St. James <Q>ye do well.</Q> <HI>That</HI> law forbids every thing by which our neighbour can be injured, and commands every thing by which he can be benefited. It &s;ays, <Q>Do not commit a|dultry;</Q> It &s;ays al&s;o "Do not kill." It &s;ays al&s;o, <Q>Do not &s;teal, do not covet, do not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s,</Q> do not &s;lander, do not injure thy neighbour in any matter.</P>
<P>IN &s;imilar terms St. Paul &s;aith, <Q>He that hath loved a|nother, hath fulfilled the law.</Q> For this law, <Q>Thou &s;hall not commit adultry;</Q> and this law, <Q>Thou &s;halt not kill;</Q> and this law, "Thou &s;halt not &s;teal" and this law, "Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s;" and this law, <Q>Thou &s;halt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;ay|ing, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfiling of the law.</Q></P>
<P>LET men be actuated by this love, which is an emana|tion from the all-glorious Architect of all nature&mdash;from him that built all things, and tell me where are wars, and tumults, and murder, and blood&s;hed, and rapine, and &s;teal|ing, and violence, and &s;lander&mdash;where is any evil work? They are fled; they are become as &s;moak; like cloud after rain they are pa&s;&s;ed, and gone, and vani&s;hed away&mdash;no more to cur&s;e the earth; no more to &s;et neighbour a|gain&s;t neighbour, nation again&s;t nation, and people again&s;t people.</P>
<P>THIS happy &s;tate, my friends, God intended for man even in this world, and therefore commanded every man to love his neighbour as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>YOUR profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign, Venerable brethren of the Ma&s;onic Fraternity, to whom I have now the plea&s;ure of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, is to co-operate with the Almighty and infinitely gracious Architect of nature, according as your various

&s;tations &s;hall permit, to &s;pread this divine principle of be|nevolence and love thro' the world, and make it effectual to the grand purpo&s;e of human happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THAT this principle proceeds from the author of nature, the author of order and peace, appears from the nature of the world which he made in ju&s;t order &amp; exact proportion; from the nature of man whom he formed to live in the world when he had made it; from the nature of that holy religion by which man is redeemed from death and made partaker of the hope of a ble&s;&s;ed re&s;urrection to eternal life. This religion, I tru&s;t in God's goodne&s;s you all profe&s;s. By the principles of your holy religion; by the priciples of the order of Ma&s;ons, I conjure you to keep ever in mind the grand object you ought ever to have in view, the cultivation of love, and unity, and concord; and of cour&s;e, of order and peace and good will among men. Endeavour therefore to bani&s;h all &s;trife, and di&s;|cord, and ill will from among men. Di&s;countenance eve|ry temper, every di&s;po&s;ition which tends to di&s;turb the peace and quiet of civil &s;ociety, or to make men le&s;s ob|servant of the laws and regulations by which the peace and happine&s;s of our country is now &s;ecured, and remem|ber, that by cultivating order, and peace, and benevolent di&s;po&s;itions among men; by checking every tendency to rapine, and war, and confu&s;ion among them, you co-op|erate with the de&s;igns of the infinitely wi&s;e and good Cre|ator who built all things; who made man, not to worry but to be mutually beneficial to each other; and that then we mo&s;t re&s;emble him, when we mo&s;t cultivate tho&s;e tem|pers and di&s;po&s;itions which peculiarly flow from him, the author and fountain of all that is good&mdash;To whom be glory forever.</P>
<P>MATTERS which relate to war ought to be left to the Go|vernors and rulers of our country&mdash;To them they per|ticularly belong, to them the con&s;titution of our Govern|ment hath committed them: Their abilities are equal to the deci&s;ion, and we have no rea&s;on to doubt their integrity.</P>
<P>LET us then confine our&s;elves to our own proper duty

every one in his &s;tation; remembering that as God hath built all things in due order, in ju&s;t weight, and exact proportion, our duty requires that we have a regard to order, to the rea&s;on, nature, and proportions of things in all our conduct.&mdash;That love and good-will is the only principle that can &s;upport this order, that comports with this rea&s;on, that reaches the nature or proportion of things among which we live:&mdash;That love is in the moral, what gravitation is in the natural world, the law of the creator and that it would as invariably produce its full effect in the moral, as gravitation does in the natural world, was it not counteracted by the corrupt and perve&s;e wills of incon&s;ide|rate and ob&s;tinate men.</P>
<P>OUR duty requires that we counteract this perver&s;ity of the human will; and as nothing can do this more effectu|ally than the &s;ilent per&s;ua&s;ion of a good example, let it be the earne&s;t care of every Ma&s;on, to &s;et that good example to others. "Let brotherly love continue", is the motto of their order, let it be al&s;o the governing principle of their conduct.
