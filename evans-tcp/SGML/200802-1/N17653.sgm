<HEAD>THOUGHTS UPON THE <HI>Amu&s;ements</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> WHICH ARE PROPER FOR SCHOOLS. ADDRESSED TO GEORGE CLYMER, ESQ. BY <HI>BENJAMIN RUSH, M. D.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE la&s;t time I had the plea&s;ure of being in your company, you did me the honour to reque&s;t my opinion upon the AMUSEMENTS and PUNISHMENTS which are pro|per for &s;chools. The &s;ubjects are of a very oppo&s;ite nature, but I &s;hall endeavour to comply with your wi&s;hes, by &s;ending you a few thoughts upon each of them. I am &s;ure you will not reject my opini|ons becau&s;e they are contrary to received practices, for I know that you are accu&s;tomed to think for your&s;elf, and that every propo&s;ition that has for its objects the intere&s;ts of humanity and your country, will he treated by you with attention and candor.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the &s;ubject of AMUSEMENTS. Monte&s;quieu informs us that the ex|erci&s;es of the la&s;t day of the life of Epaminondas, were the &s;ame as his amu&s;ements in his youth. Herein we have an epitome of the perfec|tion of education. The amu&s;ements of Epaminondas were of a military nature; but as the profe&s;&s;ion of arms is the bu&s;ine&s;s of only a &s;mall part of mankind, and happily much le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the United States than in ancient Greece, I would propo&s;e that the amu&s;ements of our youth, at &s;chool, &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch ex|erci&s;es as will be mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to their future employments in life. The&s;e are; 1. agriculture; 3. me|chanical occupations; and 3. the bu&s;ine&s;s of the learned profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a variety in the em|ployments of agriculture which may readily be &s;uited to the genius, ta&s;te, and &s;trength of young people. An experiment has been made of the efficacy of the&s;e employments, as amu&s;ements, in the Methodi&s;t Col|lege at Abington, in Maryland; and, I have been informed, with the happie&s;t effects. A large lot is divided between the &s;cholars, and premiums are adjudged to tho&s;e of them who produce the mo&s;t vege|tables from their grounds, or who keep them in the be&s;t order.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the employments of agri|culture cannot afford amu&s;ement at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, or in cities,
<PB N="2" REF="022866_0002_0FBA9A5A2B4BA610">
I would propo&s;e, that children &s;hould be allured to &s;eek amu&s;e|ments in &s;uch of the mechanical arts as are &s;uited to their &s;trength and capacities. Where is the boy who does not delight in the u&s;e of a hammer&mdash;a chi&s;&s;el&mdash;or a &s;aw? and who has not enjoyed a high de|gree of plea&s;ure in his youth, in con&s;tructing a miniature hou&s;e? How amu&s;ing are the machines which are employed in the manu|factory of cloathing of all kinds! and how full of various entertain|ment are the mixtures which take place in the chemical arts! each of the&s;e might be contrived upon &s;uch a &s;cale, as not only to amu&s;e young people, but to afford a profit to their parents or ma&s;ters. The Moravians, at Bethlehem in our &s;tate, have proved that this propo|&s;ition is not a chimerical one. All the amu&s;ements of their children are derived from their performing the &s;ubordinate parts of &s;everal of the mechanical arts; and a con&s;i|derable portion of the wealth of that worthy and happy &s;ociety is derived from the labour of their little hands.&mdash;</P>
<P>If, in the&s;e amu&s;ements, an ap|peal &s;hould be made to that &s;pirit of competition which is &s;o common a|mong young people, it would be the means of producing more plea|&s;ure to the children, and more pro|fit to all who are connected with them. The wealth of tho&s;e manu|facturing towns in England, which employ the children of poor people, is a proof of what might be expect|ed from connecting amu&s;ement and labour together, in all our &s;chools. The product from the labour ob|tained in this way, from all the &s;chools in the United States, would amount to a &s;um which would al|mo&s;t exceed calculation.</P>
<P N="3">3. To train the youth who are intended for the learned profe&s;&s;i|ons, or for merchandize, to the duties of their future employments, by means of u&s;eful amu&s;ements, which are <HI>related</HI> to tho&s;e employ|ments, will be impracticable; but their amu&s;ements may be derived from cultivating a &s;pot of ground; for where is the lawyer, the phy|&s;ician, the divine, or the merchant, who has not indulged or felt a pa&s;|&s;ion, in &s;ome part of his life, for rural improvements?&mdash;&mdash;Indeed I conceive the &s;eeds of knowledge in agriculture will be mo&s;t productive, when they are planted in the minds of this cla&s;s of &s;cholars.</P>
<P>I have only to add under this head, that the common amu&s;ements of children have no connection with their future occupations. Many of them injure their clothes, &s;ome of them wa&s;te their &s;trength, and im|pair their health, and all of them prove, more or le&s;s, the means of producing noi&s;e, or of exciting an|gry pa&s;&s;ions, both of which are cal|culated to beget vulgar manners. The Methodi&s;ts have wi&s;ely bani&s;h|ed every &s;pecies of play from their college. Even the healthy and plea&s;urable exerci&s;e of &s;wimming, is not permitted to their &s;cholars, except in the pre&s;ence of one of their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Do not think me too &s;trict if I here exclude <HI>gunning</HI> from among the amu&s;ements of young men. My objections to it are as follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. It hardens the heart, by in|flicting unnece&s;&s;ary pain and death upon animals.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is unnece&s;&s;ary in civilized &s;ociety, where animal food may be obtained from dome&s;tic animals, with greater facility.</P>
<P N="3">3. It con&s;umes a great deal of time, and thus creates habits of idlene&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. It frequently leads young men into low, and bad company.</P>
<P N="5">5. By impo&s;ing long ab&s;tinence
<PB N="3" REF="022866_0003_0FBA9A5BACEE0788">
from food, it leads to intemperance in eating, which naturally leads to intemperance in drinking.</P>
<P N="6">6. It expo&s;es to fevers, and ac|cidents. The news-papers are oc|ca&s;ionally filled with melancholy ac|counts of the latter, and every phy|&s;ician mu&s;t have met with frequent and dangerous in&s;tances of the for|mer, in the cour&s;e of his practice.</P>
<P>I know the early u&s;e of a gun is recommended in our country, to teach our young men the u&s;e of fire-arms, and thereby to prepare them for war and battle. But why &s;hould we in&s;pire our youth, by &s;uch exerci&s;es, with ho&s;tile ideas towards their fellow creatures?&mdash; Let us rather in&s;till into their minds &s;entiments of univer&s;al benevolence to men of all nations and colours. Wars originate in error and vice. Let us eradicate the&s;e, by proper modes of education, and wars will cea&s;e to be nece&s;&s;ary in our coun|try. The divine author and lover of peace "will then &s;uffer no man to do us wrong; yea he will re|prove kings for our &s;ake, &s;aying, touch not my anointed and do my people no harm." Should the na|tions with whom war is a trade, approach our coa&s;ts, they will re|tire from us, as Satan did from our Saviour, when he came to a&s;&s;ault him; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, be|cau&s;e they will 'find nothing in us' congenial to their malignant di&s;po|&s;itions; for the flames of war can be &s;pread from one nation to another, only by the conducting mediums of vice and error.</P>
<P>I have hinted at the injury which is done to the health of young peo|ple by &s;ome of their amu&s;ements; but there is a practice common in all our &s;chools, which does more harm to their bodies than all the a|mu&s;ements that can be named, and that is, obliging them to &s;it too long in <HI>one place,</HI> or crowding too many of them together <HI>in one room.</HI> By means of the former, the growth and &s;hape of the body have been im|paired; and by means of the latter, the &s;eeds of fevers have often been engendered in &s;chools. In the cour&s;e of my bu&s;ine&s;s, I have been called to many hundred children who have been &s;eized with indi&s;po|&s;itions in &s;chool, which evidently a|ro&s;e from the action of morbid ef|fluvia, produced by the confined breath and per&s;piration of too great a number of children in one room. To obviate the&s;e evils, children &s;hould be permitted, after they have &s;aid their le&s;&s;ons, to amu&s;e them&s;elves in the open air, in &s;ome of the u&s;eful and agreeable exerci&s;es which have been mentioned. Their minds will be &s;trengthened, as well as their bodies relieved by them. To oblige a &s;prightly boy to &s;it <HI>&s;e|ven</HI> hours in a day, with his little arms pinioned to his &s;ides, and his neck unnaturally bent towards his book; and for <HI>no crime!</HI>&mdash;what cruelty and folly are manife&s;ted, by &s;uch an ab&s;urd mode of in&s;tructing or governing young people!</P>
<P>I come next to &s;ay a few words upon the &s;ubject of PUNISHMENTS which are proper in &s;chools.</P>
<P>In barbarous ages every thing partook of the complexion of the times. Civil, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, military, and dome&s;tic puni&s;hments were all of a cruel nature. With the pro|gre&s;s of rea&s;on and chri&s;tianity, puni&s;hments of all kinds have be|come le&s;s &s;evere. Solitude and la|bour are now &s;ub&s;tituted in many countries, with &s;ucce&s;s, in the room of the whipping-po&s;t and the gal|lows.&mdash;The innocent infirmities of human nature are no longer pro|&s;cribed, and puni&s;hed by the church. Di&s;cipline, con&s;i&s;ting in the vigi|lance of officers, has le&s;&s;ened the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of military exe|cutions; and hu&s;bands&mdash;fathers&mdash;
<PB N="4" REF="022866_0004_0FBA9A5D4CC8CBF0">
and ma&s;ters now blu&s;h at the hi&s;to|ry of the times, when wives, chil|dren, and &s;ervants, were govern|ed only by force. But unfortunate|ly this &s;pirit of humanity and civili|zation has not reached our &s;chools. The rod is yet the principal in&s;tru|ment of governing them, and a &s;chool-ma&s;ter remains the only de&s;|pot now known in free countries. Perhaps it is becau&s;e the little &s;ub|jects of their arbitrary and caprici|ous power have not been in a con|dition to complain. I &s;hall endea|vour therefore to plead their cau&s;e, and to prove that corporal puni&s;h|ments (except to children under four or five years of age) are never nece&s;&s;ary, and always hurtful, in &s;chools.&mdash;The following arguments I hope will be &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h this propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1">1. Children are &s;eldom &s;ent to &s;chool before they are capable of feeling the force of rational or mo|ral obligation. They may there|fore be deterred from committing offences, by motives le&s;s di&s;grace|ful than the fear of corporal puni&s;h|ments.</P>
<P N="2">2 By correcting children for ig|norance and negligence in &s;chool, their ideas of <HI>improper</HI> and <HI>immoral</HI> actions are confounded, and hence the moral faculty becomes weakned in after life. It would not be more cruel or ab&s;urd to inflict the puni&s;h|ment of the whipping-po&s;t upon a man, for not dre&s;&s;ing fa&s;hionably or neatly, than it is to ferule a boy for blotting his copy-book, or mis|&s;pelling a word.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the natural affection of a parent is &s;ometimes in&s;ufficient, to re&s;train the violent effects of a &s;ud|den gu&s;t of anger upon a child, how dangerous mu&s;t the power of cor|recting children be, when lodged in the hands of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, in who&s;e anger there is no mixture of parental affection! Perhaps tho&s;e parents act mo&s;t wi&s;ely, who ne|ver tru&s;t them&s;elves to inflict cor|poral puni&s;hments upon their chil|dren, after they are four or five years old, but endeavour to puni&s;h, and reclaim them, by confinement, or by abridging them of &s;ome of their u&s;ual gratifications, in dre&s;s, food or amu&s;ements.</P>
<P N="4">4. Injuries are &s;ometimes done to the bodies, and &s;ometimes to the intellects of children, by corporal puni&s;hments. I recollect, when a boy, to have lo&s;t a &s;chool-mate, who was &s;aid to have died in con&s;equence of a &s;evere whipping he received in &s;chool. At that time I did not believe it po&s;&s;ible, but from what I now know of the di&s;proportion be|tween the violent emotions of the mind, and the &s;trength of the body in children, I am di&s;po&s;ed to be|lieve, that not only &s;ickne&s;s, but that even <HI>death</HI> may be induced, by the convul&s;ions of a youthful mind, worked up to a high &s;en&s;e of &s;hame and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The effects of thumping the head, boxing the ears, and pulling the hair, in impairing the intellects, by means of injuries done to the brain, are too obvious to be mentioned.</P>
<P N="5">5. Where there is <HI>&s;hame,</HI> &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, there may be <HI>virtue.</HI> But corporal puni&s;hments, inflicted at &s;chool, have a tendency to de|&s;troy the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, and there|by to de&s;troy all moral &s;en&s;ibility. The boy that has been often public|ly whipped at &s;chool, is under great obligations to his maker, and his parents, if he afterwards e&s;cape the whipping-po&s;t or the gallows.</P>
<P N="6">6. Corporal puni&s;hments, inflict|ed at &s;chool, tend to beget a &s;pirit of violence in boys towards each o|ther, which often follows them through life; but they more cer|tainly beget a &s;pirit of hatred, or revenge, towards their ma&s;ters, which too often becomes a ferment
<PB N="5" REF="022866_0005_0FBA9A5EA2D70588">
of the &s;ame baneful pa&s;&s;ions towards other people. The celebrated Dr. afterwards Baron Haller declared, that he never &s;aw, without horror, during the remaining part of his life, a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who had treated him with unmerited &s;everi|ty, when he was only ten years old. A &s;imilar anecdote is related of the famous M. de Condamine. I think I have known &s;everal in&s;tan|ces of this vindictive, or indignant &s;pirit, to continue towards a cruel and tyrannical &s;chool-ma&s;ter, in per&s;ons who were advanced in life, and who were otherwi&s;e of gentle and forgiving di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P N="7">7. Corporal puni&s;hments, inflict|ed at &s;chools, beget a hatred to in|&s;truction in young people. I have &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected that the devil, who knows how great an enemy knowledge is to his kingdom, has had the addre&s;s to make the world believe that <HI>feruling, pulling</HI> and <HI>boxing ears, cudgelling, hor&s;ing,</HI> &amp;c. and, in boarding-&s;chools, a <HI>lit|tle &s;tarving,</HI> are all ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for the government of young people, on purpo&s;e that he might make both &s;chools, and &s;chool-ma&s;|ters odious, and thereby keep our world in ignorance; for ignorance is the be&s;t means the devil ever contrived, to keep up the number of his &s;ubjects in our world.</P>
<P N="8">8 Corporal puni&s;hments are not only hurtful, but altogether unne|ce&s;&s;ary, in &s;chools. Some of the mo&s;t celebrated and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;chool-ma&s;ters, that I have ever known, never made u&s;e of them.</P>
<P N="9">9. The fear of corporal puni&s;h|ments, by debilitating the body, produces a corre&s;ponding debility in the mind, which contracts its ca|pacity of acquiring knowledge. This capacity is enlarged by the tone which the mind acquires from the action of hope, love, and con|fidence upon it; and all the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions might ea&s;ily be cheri&s;hed, by a prudent and enlightened &s;chool-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="10">10. As there &s;hould always be a certain ratio between the &s;trength of a remedy, and the excitability of the body in di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o there &s;hould be a &s;imilar ratio between the force employed in the govern|ment of a &s;chool, and the capacities and tempers of children. A kind rebuke, like fre&s;h air in a fainting fit, is calculated to act upon a young mind with more effect, than &s;timu|lants of the greate&s;t power; but corporal puni&s;hments level all capa|cities and tempers, as quack-medi|cines do all con&s;titutions and di&s;ea&s;es. They di&s;honour and degrade our &s;pecies; for they &s;uppo&s;e a total ab|&s;ence of all moral and intellectual feeling from the mind. Have we not often &s;een dull children &s;udden|ly improve, by changing their &s;chools? The rea&s;on is obvious. The &s;ucce&s;sful teacher only accom|modated his manner and di&s;cipline to the capacities of his &s;cholars.</P>
<P N="11">11. I conceive corporal puni&s;h|ments, inflicted in an arbitrary manner, to be contrary to the &s;pi|rit of liberty, and that they &s;hould not be tolerated in a free govern|ment. Why &s;hould not children be protected from violence and inju|ries, as well as white and black &s;er|vants?&mdash;Had I influence enough in our legi&s;lature to obtain only a &s;in|gle law, it &s;hould be to make the puni&s;hment for &s;triking a &s;chool|boy, the &s;ame as for a&s;&s;aulting and beating an adult member of &s;ocie|ty.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e arguments I know &s;ome well di&s;po&s;ed people will re|ply, that the <HI>rod</HI> has received a di|vine commi&s;&s;ion from the &s;acred Scriptures, as the in&s;trument of correcting children. To this I an|&s;wer that the <HI>rod,</HI> in the Old Te&s;|tament, by a very common figure
<PB N="6" REF="022866_0006_0FBA9A601D9E0800">
in rhetoric, &s;tands for puni&s;hments of <HI>any</HI> kind, ju&s;t as the <HI>&s;word,</HI> in the New Te&s;tament, &s;tands for the faithful and general admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in &s;uch a way as is mo&s;t calculated to reform criminals, and to prevent crimes.</P>
<P>The following method of govern|ing a &s;chool, I apprehend, would be attended with much better ef|fects, than that which I have en|deavoured to &s;hew, to be contrary to rea&s;on, humanity, religion, li|berty, and the experience of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t teachers in the world.</P>
<P>Let a &s;chool-ma&s;ter endeavour, in the fir&s;t place, to acquire the confidence of his &s;cholars, by a pru|dent deportment. Let him learn to command his pa&s;&s;ions and tem|per, at all times, in his &s;chool.&mdash; Let him treat the name of the Su|preme Being with reverence, as often as it occurs in books, or in conver&s;ation with his &s;cholars.&mdash; Let him exact a re&s;pectful behavi|our towards him&s;elf, in his &s;chool; but in the intervals of &s;chool-hours, let him treat his &s;cholars with gen|tlene&s;s and familiarity. If he &s;hould even join in their amu&s;ements, he would not lo&s;e, by his conde&s;cen|&s;ion, any part of his authority over them. But to &s;ecure their affection and re&s;pect more perfectly, let him, once or twice a year, lay out a &s;mall &s;um of money in pen-knives, and books, and di&s;tribute them a|mong his &s;cholars, as rewards for proficiency in learning, and for good behaviour. If the&s;e prudent and popular mea&s;ures &s;hould fail of pre|venting offences at &s;chool, then let the following modes of puni&s;hment be adopted.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Private</HI> admonition. By this mode of rebuking, we imitate the conduct of the divine Being to|wards his offending creatures, for His <HI>fir&s;t</HI> puni&s;hment is always in|flicted <HI>privately,</HI> by means of the <HI>&s;till</HI> voice of con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="2">2. Confinement after &s;chool-hours are ended; but with the knowledge of the parents of chil|dren.</P>
<P N="3">3. Holding a &s;mall &s;ign of di&s;grace, of any kind, in the middle of the floor, in the pre&s;ence of a whole &s;chool.</P>
<P>If the&s;e puni&s;hments fail of re|claiming a bad boy, he &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from &s;chool, to prevent his corrupting his &s;chool-mates. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of parents, and not of &s;chool-ma&s;ters, to u&s;e the la&s;t means for eradicating idlene&s;s and vice from their children.</P>
<P>The world was created in love. It is &s;u&s;tained by love. Nations and families that are happy, are made &s;o only by love. Let us extend this divine principle, to tho&s;e little com|munities which we call &s;chools. Children are capable of loving in a high degree. They may therefore be governed by love.</P>
<P>The occupation of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter is truly dignified. He is (next to mothers) the mo&s;t import|ant member of civil &s;ociety. Why then is there &s;o little rank connect|ed with that occupation? Why do we treat it with &s;o much neglect, or contempt? It is becau&s;e the voice of rea&s;on, in the human heart, a&s;&s;oci|ates with it the idea of de&s;poti&s;m and violence. Let &s;chool-ma&s;ters cea&s;e to be tyrants, and they will &s;oon enjoy the re&s;pect and rank, which are naturally connected with their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We are gro&s;ly mi&s;taken in look|ing up wholly to our governments, and even to mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, to promote public and private order in &s;ociety. Mothers and &s;chool-ma&s;ters plant the &s;eeds of nearly all the good and evil which exi&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="022866_0007_0FBA9A619757B158">
in our world. Its reformation mu&s;t therefore be begun in nur|&s;eries and in &s;chools. If the ha|bits we acquire there, were to have no influence upon our future happine&s;s, yet the influence they have upon our governments, is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why we ought to introduce new modes, as well as new objects of education into our country.</P>
<P>You have lately been employed in an attempt to perpetuate our ex|i&s;tence as a free people, by e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the means of national cre|dit and defence;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Clymer is one of the Repre&s;entatives of Penn&s;ylvania, in the Congre&s;s of the United States.</NOTE> but the&s;e are feeble bulwarks again&s;t &s;lavery, compared with habits of labour and virtue, di&s;&s;eminated among our young people. Let us e&s;tabli&s;h &s;chools for this purpo&s;e, in every town&s;hip in the United States, and conform them to rea&s;on, humanity, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety in America. Then, Sir, will the ge|nerations who are to follow us, re|alize the precious ideas of the dig|nity and excellence of republican forms of government, which I well recollect you cheri&s;hed with &s;o much ardor, in the beginning of the American revolution, and which you have manife&s;ted ever &s;ince, both by your public and private con|duct.</P>
<P>We &s;uffer &s;o much from tradi|tional error of various kinds, in e|ducation, morals, and government, that I have been led to wi&s;h, that it were po&s;&s;ible for us to have &s;chools e&s;tabli&s;hed, in the United States, for teaching <HI>the art of forgetting.</HI> I think three-fourths of all our &s;chool-ma&s;ters, divines, and legi&s;lators would profit very much, by &s;pending two or three years in &s;uch u&s;eful in|&s;titutions.</P>
<P>An apology may &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, not only for the length of this letter, but for &s;ome of the opinions contain|ed in it. I know how apt mankind are to brand every propo&s;ition for innovation, as vi&s;ionary and Uto|pian. But good men &s;hould not be di&s;couraged, by &s;uch epithets, from their attempts to combat vice and error. There never was an improvement, in any art or &s;cience, nor even a propo&s;al for meliorating the condition of man, in any age or country, that has not been con|&s;idered in the light of what has been called, &s;ince Sir Thomas More's time, an <HI>Utopian &s;cheme.</HI> The application of the magnet to navigation, and of &s;team to mecha|nical purpo&s;es, have both been branded as Utopian projects. The great idea in the mind of Columbus, of exploring a new world, was long viewed, in mo&s;t of the courts of Europe, as the dream of a vi|&s;ionary &s;ailor. But why do we go to ancient times, for proofs of im|portant innovations in human af|fairs having been treated as Utopi|an &s;chemes. You and I recollect the time, when the abolition of ne|gro &s;lavery in our &s;tate, as al&s;o when the independence of the U|nited States, and the pre&s;ent wi&s;e and happy confederacy of our re|publics, were all con&s;idered by ma|ny of our &s;ober prudent men, as &s;ubjects of an Utopian nature.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e benefactors of mankind, who have levelled mountains in the great road of human life, by the di&s;coveries or labours which have been mentioned, have been &s;tigma|tized with obloquy, as vi&s;ionary projectors, why &s;hould an indivi|dual be afraid of &s;imilar treatment, who has only attempted to give to
<PB N="8" REF="022866_0008_0FBA9A6312207508">
that road, from its beginning, a &s;traight direction.</P>
<P>If only a dozen men like your|&s;elf, approve of my opinions, it will overbalance the mo&s;t illiberal op|po&s;ition they may meet with, from all the learned vulgar of the United States.</P>
<P>For the benefit of tho&s;e per&s;ons who con&s;ider opinions as improved, like certain liquors, by time; and who are oppo&s;ed to innovations, only becau&s;e they did not occur to their ance&s;tors, I &s;hall conclude my letter with an anecdote of a mini&s;|ter in London, who, after employ|ing a long &s;ermon, in controverting what he &s;uppo&s;ed to be an heretical opinion, concluded it with the fol|lowing words, "I tell you, I tell you my brethren,&mdash;I tell you again, &mdash;that an old error is better than a new truth."</P>

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> Since writing the above letter, an ingenious German friend of mine has informed me, that a curious work has lately appeared in Germany, entitled, "A trea|ti&s;e on human mi&s;ery," written by a Mr. Salzman, an enlightened &s;chool-ma&s;ter, in which a &s;triking view is given of the mi&s;ery inflict|ed upon part of the human race, by the pre&s;ent ab&s;urd, and cruel modes of conducting education in public &s;chools. The author concludes this part of his work, my friend informs me, with a dream, in which he beholds with ineffable joy, the avenging angel de&s;cending from heaven, and afterwards con&s;uming in an immen&s;e bonfire, certain ab|&s;urd &s;chool-books, and <HI>all the fe|rules</HI> in the world.</P>
