<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have pre&s;um'd, without Your Leave, to in&s;cribe to your Name the following DIS|COURSE, (for the Sub&s;tance preached in Your Hearing, but now publi&s;h'd with &s;ome Enlargements &amp; Additions,) which I hope You will ea&s;ily excu&s;e, when You con&s;ider how naturally I was led into this Dedication. Not|with&s;tanding the Meanne&s;s of the <HI>Compo&s;ure,</HI> yet (the <HI>Subject</HI> being &s;o grateful to You) You were pleas'd to order it to the Pre&s;s; herein imitating good <HI>Jacob,</HI> who erected a Monument on his beloved <HI>Rachel</HI>s Grave, as a Te&s;timony of His Re&s;pect to Her, and to be a &s;tanding Memorial of Her Life and Death. And it is <HI>in obedience to Your Com|mand,</HI> (as well as at the Reque&s;t of others, and (to

And &s;ince It comes abroad under <HI>Your</HI> Patronage, I need not make any manner of <HI>Apology</HI> for expo|&s;ing it to public View; altho' I imagine my &s;elf not unfurni&s;ht with &s;ufficient Excu&s;es both for Preaching and Printing on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion. It wou'd be <HI>Enough</HI> to &s;ay, I have <HI>good Example</HI> for it in many In&s;tances, as well Ancient as Modern. Some Expo&s;itors (as one ob&s;erves<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Mather's <HI>Ornaments for the Daughters of Zion.</HI> p. 6.7.</NOTE>) judge, that the <HI>De&s;cription of a Virtuous Woman,</HI> in the la&s;t Chapter of the Proverbs, is <HI>Solomon</HI>s Reciprocation in the prai&s;e of his incomparable Mother <HI>Bath&s;he|bah</HI>: having fir&s;t recorded &s;ome of her wi&s;e Sayings and godly Coun&s;ils, (<HI>The Prophecy which his Mo|ther taught Him,</HI>) He proceeds, ('tis Thought,) in a grateful &s;en&s;e of his Obligations to Her, and in Honour to her Memory, to draw her Character, and give an Encomium of Her, which wou'd <HI>remain</HI> on durable Record, after the mo&s;t la&s;ting Marble Sta|tues &s;hou'd be crumbl'd into Du&s;t. And You may have read how <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> have celebra|ted Their <HI>Mothers</HI> Names, and handed them down to Po&s;terity with great Honour. You may remem|ber al&s;o that the noble <HI>Romans</HI> of old have &s;ome|times be&s;tow'd the Re&s;pect of a <HI>Funeral Oration</HI> on Their virtuous <HI>Mothers</HI>; &amp; this under the favoura|ble Umbrage of the <HI>Public Authority,</HI> which decree'd &s;uch Honour to Them.

a little towards <HI>embalming</HI> the Name of my ever honour'd and truly memorable Mother.

<HEAD>A SERMON occa&s;ion'd by the DEATH of Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Foxcroft.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM XXXV. 14.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash; I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his Mother.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING been invited, to take the Opportunity of my being here this Day, to preach unto You, I thought it wou'd not be improper to enter|tain you with &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable Me|ditations, which I have lately had on this Text, upon the mo&s;t <HI>affecting Occa&s;ion</HI> that has ever oc|curr'd to Me in the few Years I have liv'd.</P>
<P>DIVINE PROVIDENCE hath &s;een meet within a little while to take away by Death <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Brattle,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Leverett,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Hutchin&s;on,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> &s;everal <HI>Mo|thers in I&s;rael,</HI> (who have &s;ome of their Relations in this Place) <HI>Devout &amp; Honourable Women,</HI> who&s;e Memory is ble&s;&s;ed; And we cannot but be &s;en&s;i|bly touch'd with the <HI>repeated</HI> Stroke in the Remo|val of <HI>Another</HI> the la&s;t Week, that was al&s;o valua|ble to all and nearly related to Many of us here
<PB N="2" REF="002218_0009_0FDAD040513643E8">
pre&s;ent. Truly <HI>the Blow is heavy, and the Breach wide.</HI> And to be affected with &s;o &s;olemn a Provi|dence, as the Departure of Per&s;ons of Name and Worth, of Piety and Serviceablene&s;s, Is what every common <HI>Neighbour</HI> is under civil and chri&s;tian Ob|ligations to. This is what the <HI>&s;pecial Friends</HI> and Acquaintants of the Decea&s;ed, who have a nearer Concern in the Lo&s;s, are more peculiarly oblig'd to. &mdash; But the <HI>Relatives</HI> are under natural and the &s;tronge&s;t Bonds to Mourn the Death of Pious and U&s;eful Per&s;ons &mdash;&mdash;. That I might more particu|larly &s;uit my Di&s;cour&s;e to the Ca&s;e of Relatives in Mourning; e&s;pecially of Children for the Lo&s;s of a gracious Mother, which is the melancholy Ca&s;e of not a Few in this Audience, (and may be &s;o of Others e're long) I have therefore cho&s;en the Words before Us for the Subject of our pre&s;ent Con&s;idera|tion; &mdash; <HI>I bowed down heavily, as One that mour|neth for his Mother.</HI></P>
<P>THE Per&s;on here &s;peaking is holy <HI>David,</HI> the Royal P&s;almi&s;t of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> He makes a Prote&s;tation of his cordial Love towards and tender Sympathy with his Enemies and Per&s;ecutors under their Af|flictions. They <HI>rejoyced</HI> indeed in his <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI>: but he <HI>mourned</HI> in their's. If they were vi&s;ited with <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> he <HI>Sympathized with them,</HI> and car|ry'd it towards them with the greate&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion and the kinde&s;t U&s;age: If they were remov'd by <HI>Death,</HI> He <HI>Mourned for them,</HI> bowing down his head in great heavine&s;s, and condoling the Lo&s;s, as tho' there had been an intimate <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> or near <HI>Re|lation</HI> between them: Yea, his Grief at their Death did bear &s;ome Proportion and Similitude to the Sorrow of dutiful Children, bereaved of a dear
<PB N="3" REF="002218_0010_0FDAD062D2CDF318">
and de&s;irable <HI>Mother</HI>; &s;uch an One as <HI>David's</HI> own was, and whom perhaps he may now refer to more immediately. At their Death, he took on, as for the Lo&s;s of his own Mother, a gracious &amp; tender Mother. This di&s;covers the P&s;almi&s;t to be one of an excellent Spirit, &amp; a truly extraordinary Compa&s;&s;ion; a Man made up of Pity and Benevolence, and acted by the &s;uperior Principles of Religion. He has &s;et us an Example of uncommon Humanity, and Charity; which challenges Con&s;ideration and Imitation. But I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t here. &mdash; I de&s;ign to take No|tice only of the <HI>Allu&s;ion</HI> or incidental Hint in our Text,&mdash; of <HI>One's Mourning for his Mother,</HI>&mdash;which intimates the Lawfulne&s;s, and Decency, yea and Duty of lamenting the Death of near Relations, and particularly of a dear and good Mother.</P>
<P>AND this is the Point of Doctrine now (as GOD &s;hall help) to be di&s;cour&s;ed upon:
<Q>IT is Lawful, yea Proper, and a Duty to m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> the Death if near Relations, and particula<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> of a tender and religious Mother.</Q></P>
<P>THE Decea&s;e of &s;uch is a ju&s;t Matter and Motive of Lamentation. Our neare&s;t &amp; deare&s;t Relatives mu&s;t die and go to the Hou&s;e appointed for all li|ving. <HI>Father</HI> &amp; <HI>Mother</HI> mu&s;t be &s;eparated from us by <HI>Their</HI> or <HI>Our</HI> Death. The &s;tronge&s;t Ties of Nature or Affection can't continue our Union together in this World, when Death comes to di&s;&s;olve the &s;ame. And the Parting with lov'd Relations, is a proper Occa&s;ion of Grief. Their Death is a very Melancho|ly Thing, and to be laid to Heart. The Removal of a tender Parent, of a delightful Child, of a loving
<PB N="4" REF="002218_0011_0FDAD041D6BBA420">
Brother or Si&s;ter, or any affectionate and beloved Relative what&s;oever, is a <HI>Mournful</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, and to be &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;ented and &s;uitably improved. But I &s;hall confine my &s;elf to &s;peak particularly of the Death of a pious &amp; dear <HI>Mother.</HI> The Death of &s;uch an One calls for peculiar Accents of Grief. <HI>This is a Lamentation, &amp; &s;hall be for a Lamentation.</HI></P>
<P>HERE we may con&s;ider briefly &s;ome of the Grounds &amp; Rea&s;ons, that warrant &amp; require Chil|dren's Mourning on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion&punc; The follow|ing Particulars may &s;uffice.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THE Death of a tender and gracious Mother infers the Lo&s;s of a great &amp; comprehen&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing; and therefore is a deplorable Evil.</HI> The proper Ob|ject of Grief is a pre&s;ent afflictive Evil, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ivative or Po&s;itive. The Want or Lo&s;s of Good <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Negative Evil; and calls for our Mournful Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ments. Hence the Bereavement of a dear and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">cious Mother, (whom to enjoy is one of the chief Felicities of this lower World,) mu&s;t needs be accounted a mo&s;t proper Subject of deep La|mentation.</P>
<P><HI>A wi&s;e and good Mother is a very valuable Ble&s;|&s;ing.</HI> Her U&s;efulne&s;s is exten&s;ive, Her Opportuni|ties of doing Good con&s;iderable, and her Life is therefore pretious.</P>
<P>OUR wi&s;e and virtuous Mothers are no little <HI>Or|naments</HI> to the Places where they dwell; The&s;e Daughters of Zion are none of the lea&s;t of Zion's Glories, They are &s;ome of the Excellent in the Earth&punc; And when Death tran&s;lates the&s;e &s;hining Lights, it ca&s;ts a gloomy Shade on the Town, and Family; it thins the Glory, and ca&s;ts down the Beauty of I&s;rael.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002218_0012_0FDAD06452DFC980">AGAIN, Our Pious Mothers are a <HI>Defen&s;e</HI> (as well as Honour) to the re&s;pective Places of their abode: And the Town and Family, from which they are remov'd, are <HI>weaken'd</HI> by their Fall, in proportion to the Degree of their Piety, Wi&s;dom, and Influence. <HI>Devout Women</HI> are many times (in conjunction with others) in&s;trumental to the <HI>Protection</HI> of a Family or People from de&s;olating Judgments. They contribute to the <HI>Safety</HI> of a Hou&s;e or Place, &s;ometimes by their prudent <HI>Coun|&s;els,</HI> &s;ometimes by their importunate <HI>Prayers</HI>; yea &s;ometimes by their very <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI>: The Pre&s;ence of the&s;e holy, humble Ones, to whom the gracious GOD hath a &s;pecial Re&s;pect, is often a Remora to the Execution of Divine Threatnings on Others, who are ripe for the Indignation of the LORD. <HI>For their Sakes</HI> GOD doth many times mercifully &s;u&s;pend de&s;erved Judgments, or moderate His Ju|dicial Di&s;pen&s;ations. &mdash;And therefore the Depar|ture of the&s;e pious, praying Per&s;ons &s;hou'd affect and grieve the Living. The taking away of &s;uch is as a <HI>pulling down the Pillars</HI> of an Hou&s;e, or a <HI>plucking up the Stakes</HI> out of an Hedge. When &s;uch die, &s;o much of the Strength fails, and of the Defen&s;e is gone.</P>
<P>FURTHER, They are more <HI>Po&s;itive</HI> and <HI>Active Ble&s;&s;ings</HI>; and are not only the Means of keeping out hurtful Evils, but al&s;o of bringing in many real and de&s;irable Benefits. They are many ways u&s;eful by their Gifts and Graces, by their Prayers, their Example, their Advices, Reproofs, In&s;tructi|ons, <HI>&amp;c. The whole Hou&s;e fares the better for the wi&s;e and good Mother, in all it's Intere&s;ts.</HI> The Health&punc; the E&s;tate, Reputation, good Order,
<PB N="6" REF="002218_0013_0FDAD043539AD450">
Virtue and Religion of the Family, and Place, are all greatly &s;ub&s;erved by Her. &mdash; When therefore our gracious Mothers die, the <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Family,</HI> (which have enjoy'd their Pre&s;ence) are &s;o much <HI>Impoveri&s;h'd,</HI> and the common Trea&s;ure &s;unk. So much of the principal &s;tock is drawn out of the Bank. In that Hou&s;e, where the godly Mother cea&s;es, <HI>The Mea&s;ure of Gifts and Graces, and the Number of Prayers &amp; Services are le&s;&s;end</HI>; which is as the letting out of &s;o much vital Blood and Spirits, whereupon Sickne&s;s and Weakne&s;s of the Body en&s;ues.</P>
<P>SURELY then we ought to lament the Death of our honoured and pious Mothers with a very pecu|liar Sorrow. We ought to bewail it on the Account of the <HI>general Lo&s;s,</HI> which the whole Family and Town &s;u&s;tains.</P>
<P>AND We &s;hou'd <HI>every One</HI> bewail his own <HI>Per|&s;onal</HI> Lo&s;s therein. We &s;hou'd &s;adly lay to heart our own <HI>particular Concern</HI> in the common Be|reavement. We [the Children] are &s;ome of the greate&s;t Lo&s;ers. When our pious and wi&s;e and careful Mothers are taken away, <HI>Who can &s;ay how many Ble&s;&s;ings we are depriv'd of</HI> by this one awful Blow? It infers a mighty Change, a dreadful Breach on our Comforts, and often a &s;ad Increa&s;e of our Cares. Tho' when we enjoy'd them, we did not &s;ufficiently value and improve them; yet when they are gone, we &s;oon find a lamentable Mi&s;s of them. <HI>What a Melancholy Vacancy does their Removal make</HI>? When they die, We lo&s;e the <HI>Sight of them,</HI> which was &s;o much the De&s;ire of our Eyes. We lo&s;e their <HI>Wi&s;dom, Abilities</HI> &amp; <HI>Graces,</HI> which render'd them &s;uch Delights and Helps unto us.
<PB N="7" REF="002218_0014_0FDAD06624A950A0">
We lo&s;e their <HI>profitable Conver&s;ation,</HI> &amp; can no more take &s;weet Coun&s;el together with them. We want their wi&s;e Advices, their faithful Admonitions, their holy Examples, their devout Prayers, and Labours of Love. We can no more enjoy any kind A&s;|&s;i&s;tences from them of any &s;ort. Death puts a Pe|riod to all their good Offices. <HI>Their works follow them,</HI>&mdash; in this &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>A great and &s;ore Lo&s;s then do the Po&s;terity of gracious Women receive in their Death. And this Reflection be&s;peaks a very &s;en&s;ible Grief on &s;o &s;ad an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THE Death of an u&s;eful gracious Mo|ther is commonly a Rebuke on her Surviving Po&s;te|rity for their Sin.</HI> Con&s;ider'd as a <HI>Natural,</HI> and much more as a <HI>Penal</HI> Evil, this Lo&s;s is greatly to be lamented. There is many times much of the <HI>Wrath of GOD</HI> mixed with this Affliction: And the Con&s;ideration of this may well <HI>put an Edge</HI> on our Re&s;entments &amp; <HI>add Weight</HI> to our Grief. Such a Bereavement is often a &s;troke of Vindictive Ju&s;tice. The Sin of the Children &s;ometimes in|flames the Wrath of GOD, and procures the Death of their Mother. They are vile and wicked, and not worthy of Her; or are full of guilty Provoca|tions with reference unto her. If we <HI>over-rate,</HI> and <HI>over-love</HI> our valuable Parents, if we place all our Dependence on and Delight in them; if we make the Enjoyment of them the great Solace of our Lives, and build our Hopes of future Comfort too much on their Continuance, and are loth to leave them at the Divine Di&s;po&s;e: If we <HI>idolize</HI> them, and give 'em that Seat in our Hearts, which

<P N="3">III. <HI>GOD allow, expects, and requires, that We mourn on this Occa&s;ion.</HI> GOD has formed our Nature &s;o as that We are capable of being mov'd with different Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections, according to the Variety of Objects that occur, whether good or evil, pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent.

It agrees to our pre|&s;ent Make &amp; Frame; and is according to the pri|mitive <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of the Powers of Sen&s;e and Pa&s;&s;ion which are &s;o deeply planted in Us: and 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible indeed, while in the Body, to be untouch'd with &s;orrowful Impre&s;&s;ions within, when oppre&s;&s;ive Troubles without invade Us. No Affliction is for the pre&s;ent joyous, but grievous.

And They were de|&s;ign'd for <HI>good Ends</HI>; which can't be attain'd with|out the &s;ea&s;onable and regular exerting of Them. <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> then condemns a Stoical Apathy under Af|flictions: and Religion doth no le&s;s. Chri&s;tianity does not command nor commend, nor tend to effect a &s;tupid In&s;en&s;iblene&s;s under the Hand of GOD. Piety is not intended for the Extinction of Rea&s;on and Subver&s;ion of Humanity. But the <HI>De&s;ign of Religion is to correct the Di&s;orders of na|tural Affections,</HI> to guide and help Them in their Exerci&s;es on proper Occa&s;ions.

Frame and outward Behaviour according to our Condition, in Compliance with the Methods of Providence and from a Reverence to the holy Hand of GOD. We are to regard the Work of the LORD, and to con&s;ider His Operation in all that befals Us; and &s;hou'd &s;tudy to comport with the De&s;ign and an&s;wer the Call of every Di&s;pen&s;ation. Accordingly under Bereavements We are call'd to Weeping and Mourning; and <HI>GOD approves and expects,</HI> that We feel the &s;troke, that We be in|wardly affected, and breath out our Grief in all the humble Expre&s;&s;ions hereof: This is intimated in that Ob&s;ervation of the <HI>Wi&s;e Man,</HI> Eccl. 7.2. <HI>It is better to go to the hou&s;e of Mourning,</HI> [&s;o He calls the Hou&s;e where Death comes] <HI>than to the Hou&s;e of Fea&s;ting: for that it the End of all Men, and the Living</HI> [if They are wi&s;e and godly] <HI>will lay it to Heart.</HI> And &s;o in that Caution of the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> 1 The&s;. 4.13. <HI>I wou'd not have You to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning Them which are a&s;leep, that Ye &s;orrow not, even as others which have no Hope.</HI>&mdash; He <HI>allows</HI> the Sorrow; but <HI>checks</HI> the exce&s;&s;ive Degree, and reproves perhaps al&s;o &s;ome un&s;eemly Ways of expre&s;&s;ing It.</P>

There are many heavy Complaints on Record again&s;t the obdurate <HI>Jews</HI> of old upon

this Account. Thus we read, I&s;ai. 42.25. <HI>He hath poured upon Jacob the fury of His Anger; and it hath &s;et Him on fire round about, yet He knew it not; and it burned Him, yet He laid it not to Heart.</HI> So in Jer. 5.3. <HI>O Lord, Thou ha&s;t &s;tricken Them, but They have not grieved; They have refu&s;ed to re|ceive Correction; They have made their Faces har|der. than a Rock.</HI> And in the next Ver&s;e He calls this Carriage <HI>Madne&s;s; I &s;aid, Surely The&s;e are fooli&s;h; for they Know not the way of the Lord</HI>; They con&s;ider not <HI>the Judgment of GOD.</HI> And the Wi&s;e Man enters a Caveat again&s;t this Folly, Prov. 3.11. <HI>My &s;on, De&s;pi&s;e not the Cha&s;tening of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>TO be &s;tupidly <HI>blind</HI> and not &s;ee the Hand of GOD &s;miting Us, or to be wilfully <HI>indolent</HI> and not feel the Weight and Smart of tho&s;e Blows we receive, loudly proclaims our want of a Chri&s;tian Temper of Soul, and &s;adly evidences the Hardne&s;s of our Hearts and Athei&s;m of our Minds. "Indo|lence under the Effects of GDD's Anger is (as One &s;peaks) like the &s;tilne&s;s of the dead Sea, who&s;e Calm is a Cur&s;e" &mdash;. To be re&s;olvedly in&s;en|&s;ible and incon&s;iderate under Afflictions is to har|den our &s;elves again&s;t Di&s;cipline, and &s;et GOD's Judgments at Defiance. It is to &s;trengthen our &s;elves again&s;t the Almighty. It is a <HI>profane Neg|lect &amp; Contempt of the Divine Wrath.</HI> And hence mu&s;t needs offer very great Provocation to GOD. Nothing more exa&s;perates, than a &s;light of one's Di&s;plea&s;ure. <HI>To make light of the Wrath of GOD, is mo&s;t certainly very incen&s;ing to Him.</HI> &mdash; It is therefore prodigious Folly and Sin to be unaffected with GOD's Frown in the Death of near and dear
<PB N="13" REF="002218_0020_0FDAD06B1E443310">
Relations, and particularly of our valuable Parents. Some in this Ca&s;e &s;hift off all trouble&s;ome Impre&s;|&s;ions by flying to remaining temporal Comforts; or by an abu&s;ive Applying the Con&s;ideration of Death's being the End of all Men, looking on It as a nece&s;&s;ary Event, a Thing of Cour&s;e, and com|mon to every One, as what cou'd not be avoided, and for which there is no Remedy: and therefore It mu&s;t be endur'd; Grief will be no Cure &mdash;. In &s;ome &s;uch Ways as the&s;e, Many &s;eek Re|lief, and bear up Them&s;elves by the&s;e Methods under the Lo&s;s of Their Parents, and other Rela|tives; without any View to the Hand of GOD or Sen&s;e of His Anger out again&s;t Them.&mdash; But &s;urely to be thus ca&s;ele&s;s under Divine Rebukes, upon any Grounds what&s;oever, di&s;covers great Va|nity of Mind, and a &s;ecret Infidelity in the Heart. Where a Principle of Grace is in it's due Operati|on, It will influence the Under&s;tanding to con&s;ider the Tokens of GOD's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and will &s;often the Heart, &amp; cau&s;e a very tender and permanent Feeling of Them. In&s;en&s;ibility under the &s;trokes of GOD's Hand is not religious Con&s;tancy &amp; For|titude, but a wicked and fooli&s;h Stupidity. It ar|gues a very unhappy State of Soul; and offers a very heinous Indignity to Divine Providence.</P>
<P>V. <HI>SOMETIMES the Death of a pious Mo|ther leads the Way and opens the Door to many other Evils: be-&s;ure carnal Security under &s;uch a &s;troke of GOD lays open to more heavy Judgments.</HI> Sometimes &s;uch a Bereavement is the Fore-runner of great Evils. <HI>The Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="002218_0021_0FDAD04951E7B998">AN Increa&s;e of <HI>moral Evil</HI> is often con&s;equent on &s;uch a Providence. At the Gap, which the Death of a wi&s;e and good Mother makes, does many times enter in a Torrent of Impieties and Vices. It is very grievous to think, what Ungod|line&s;s, what Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, what Contention, what Intemperance, and other fooli&s;h Lu&s;ts, have found their Way into Families, after the Removal of the pious Mother; who&s;e grave Pre&s;ence, and prudent Coun&s;els, and Reproofs, together with Her holy Example, had kept a Check on the vicious Di&s;|po&s;itions of the Children, and Others, while She was alive: but being now free from this Re|&s;traint, They give Them&s;elves a Loo&s;e and Indul|gence in Sin. Yea what a &s;en&s;ible Decay of Reli|gion, and Growth of Wickedne&s;s hath there been &s;ometimes among the <HI>Body of a People in a Town</HI> upon the Death of a <HI>Number</HI> of the godly Mo|thers therein; who have &s;o con&s;iderable an Influ|ence in Family-Religion, which is nece&s;&s;ary to Public Order! It is too notorious, that &s;ometimes a deplorable Change &s;oon appears in the ri&s;ing Po&s;terity, when the gracious Mother is taken from Their Head: A degenerate Seed ri&s;es up; and when it is thus with any Number of Families in a Place, the old Proverb is often verifyed, <HI>A little Leaven leaveneth the whole Lump.</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the Death of &s;uch is often the <HI>Fore-runner of afflictive Judgments.</HI> The Remo|val of the pious Mother makes way for <HI>penal E|vils</HI> to come in upon the Family. There are Deaths perhaps to be multiply'd, or other Cala|mities to be inflicted; and from a tender Re&s;pect to this gracious Woman, GOD does <HI>gather

Her</HI> (as He did <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI>) <HI>to Her Grave in Peace, that Her Eyes may not &s;ee, and Her Heart be griev'd at the Evil</HI> to be brought on Her Children and Relations: And that <HI>He may not be put to deny the Reque&s;ts</HI> of this fervent Inter|ce&s;&s;or on their Behalf&mdash;. This pretious One mu&s;t be &s;afely lodg'd in Heaven, out of the Reach of all Griefs and Sufferings, before the de&s;troying Angel has Commi&s;&s;ion to execute Judgments on Her Po&s;terity. The <HI>Jewels</HI> are &s;ecur'd, before the <HI>Rubbi&s;h</HI> is con&s;umed. The Wheat is hous'd, when a Storm is ri&s;ing: and then the Doves flock to the Windows.</P>
<P>IT looks <HI>ominous</HI> to the Family, when the pi|ous praying Mother is taken away, who was One that <HI>&s;tood in the Breach</HI> to turn away Wrath. The Death of &s;uch an One leaves the &s;urviving Mour|ners under an ill Pre&s;age: and the Cry of the De|ceas'd unto Them is that, in Luk. 23.28. (Sons,) <HI>Daughters, Weep not for me, but weep for your &s;elves</HI> &mdash;. Weep and howl for your Mi&s;eries that are coming upon you.</P>
<P>BUT a &s;upine and &s;tubborn <HI>Apathy</HI> and <HI>Incorri|giblene&s;s,</HI> when under the Frown of Providence in the Removal of &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, does for cer|tain expo&s;e to &amp; forebode &s;till further Evils. Cold and carnal Security under this Judgment defeats the good Ends of It, and renders it altogether unprofitable to Us. And not only &s;o, but it lays us open to yet more terrible Rebukes. If <HI>We will walk contrary to GOD, He al&s;o will walk contrary to Us, and puni&s;h us &s;till &s;even Times more,</HI> (Lev. 26.23, 4,) He has many other ways to afflict us. And if we are unaffected with one Judgment, He
<PB N="16" REF="002218_0023_0FDAD04AD1363448">
will proceed to another. Verily, None ever harden'd Them&s;elves again&s;t GOD, and pro&s;per'd He will multiply aggravated Mi&s;chiefs on care|le&s;s un&s;ubdued Sinners. <HI>With the ob&s;tinate, He will &s;hew Him&s;elf ob&s;tinate.</HI> He will add to Their Yoke; and if They feel not the Whip, He will cha&s;ti&s;e Them with Scorpions. If more gentle Stripes are de&s;pis'd, &s;ometimes cutting Blows are given, 'till utter De&s;truction comes.

<P>TO be unhumbled then under &s;uch a bereaving Di&s;pen&s;ation, and impenitently to di&s;regard the Hand of GOD, is an ill Omen of more heavy Judg|ments approaching. Let this Thought &s;erve to deter Us from &s;uch Guilt and Folly; that there may be no Occa&s;ion for renewing the Complaint, in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 57.1. The Righteous peri&s;heth and <HI>no man layeth it to heart,</HI> and godly ones are taken away, <HI>None con&s;idering,</HI> that the Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>TO mourn &s;uch a Death has a Tendency to our &s;piritual Benefit, as it a&s;&s;i&s;ts our right Improve|ment of it.</HI> It will be profitable, not only to to|lerate, but to excite and &s;trengthen a mournful Sen&s;e of our Affliction; <Q>not only to admit, but to enforce the Impre&s;&s;ions of Sorrow upon this Occa&s;ion.</Q> <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, that <HI>by the &s;ad|ne&s;s of the Countenance the Heart is made better</HI>; and therefore <HI>the Heart of the Wi&s;e is in the Hou&s;e of Mourning.</HI> On &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, the Wi&s;dom that is from above will di&s;po&s;e and engage our Hearts to mournful Affections, and a religious

Improvement of the &s;orrowful Providence: And by this means, The Affliction may turn to our great Advantage. That which in it &s;elf is &s;o grie|vous an Evil, may be made in&s;trumental of the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Effects, by the Grace of GOD. Out of the Eater may come forth Meat; and Honey be &s;uck'd out of the Wormwood.</P>
<P>IF we lay to heart the Bereavement, Our Minds will <HI>more attentively regard the holy Le&s;&s;ons</HI> to be learnt from &s;uch a Di&s;pen&s;ation, and <HI>more ea&s;ily receive Religious Impre&s;&s;ions.</HI> Our Hearts mu&s;t be &s;ubdued and melted in order to the good Purpo&s;es of Divine Grace. And when They are tender and &s;often'd under Troubles, We are in a greater Di&s;|po&s;edne&s;s to be wrought upon by the &s;anctifying Spirit. <HI>Worldly Sorrow tends to godly Sorrow</HI>: for when the Spirit is tam'd and &s;ober'd, and reduced to a con&s;idering Frame, It will more readily ob|&s;erve and re&s;ent the moral Cau&s;e of Afflictions, which is Sin &mdash;. And the mournful Sen&s;e of our Trouble will have a happy Tendency to <HI>wean Us from Creature-Comforts,</HI> con&s;idering the uncertain|ty of Them. &mdash; And to promote our <HI>Acquaintance with GOD,</HI> and De&s;ires of His Favour, the good Part which can never be taken away. &mdash; It will al&s;o help to fix on our Minds a becoming <HI>Gravity,</HI> and check the Vanity We are &s;o incident to. It will tend to <HI>put us on &s;erious Work,</HI> and &s;tir us up to Duty; to awaken our Activity in preparing for our own Death, and fini&s;hing the great Bu&s;ine&s;s, of Life. In a word, A true gracious Mourning pulls out the &s;ting of the Affliction, and turns the Cur&s;e into a Ble&s;&s;ing, the Cro&s;s into a Comfort.</P>
<P>THIS is the <HI>Benefit</HI> of laying to heart the Death

of near and dear Relatives, and this Con&s;ideration &s;hould induce Us to entertain &amp; cheri&s;h a pen&s;ive &s;en&s;e of our Affliction in the Decea&s;e of a godly Mother.</P>
<P N="6">VII. <HI>WE &s;hou'd be influenced hereto from a Principle of Honour, and Love to our decea&s;ed Parent.</HI> A gracious <HI>Mother in I&s;rael,</HI> is an honourable Cha|racter. The Scriptures do every where put abun|dant Honour upon the&s;e Handmaids of the Lord, and peculiar were the Regards &s;hown to &s;uch by our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Saviour</HI> in the Days of His Fle&s;h<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Colman's,</HI> Duty and Honour of Aged Women, <HI>p.</HI> 5, 6.</NOTE>. Their name in I&s;rael is that, Highly favour'd, and ble&s;&s;ed among Women! The devout Mother is worthy therefore of a <HI>Singular Re|&s;pect</HI> from Men, e&s;pecially from Her own Chil|dren. The <HI>Fifth Commandment</HI> requires Us to <HI>honour our Mother,</HI> well as Father. And a &s;olemn <HI>mourning Her Death</HI> is one very fit and decent Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of our Reverence to Her. A Tribute of Tears at our Lo&s;s of Her is a very ju&s;t piece of Homage to her Worth, &amp; a proper In&s;tance of Filial Piety, due by all the Laws of Ju&s;tice &amp; Gratitude. To refu&s;e Her this mark of Honour, infers a re|proachful Imputation, and is the mo&s;t unpardona|ble Ba&s;ene&s;s, and Slight upon Her. To part with Her as if We &s;uffer'd nothing by our Lo&s;s, and were as happy without Her, as with Her, implys a very di&s;honourable Reflection, and is great In|ju&s;tice to Her Merits. To <HI>die unlamented</HI> is &s;ome|times denounced as a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI>; Jer. 22.18. And the contrary promi&s;ed as an <HI>Honour</HI>; Jer. 34.5.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="002218_0026_0FDAD06F90F73B30">AND to mourn Her Death is an agreeable Te&s;ti|mony of our <HI>Love</HI> to Her, as well as Honour for Her. A pious Mother ought to have a deep &s;hare in our Affections; and We &s;hould te&s;tify our Love in <HI>all</HI> the proper Expre&s;&s;ions of it. A &s;uita|ble laying to Heart and lamenting Her Death, is none of the lea&s;t Tokens of filial Affection; and therefore is what we are oblig'd to. Innumerable have been the Proofs of Her Love to Us, Her tender Cares and endearing Labours for Us from the Womb; and &s;uch as truly are beyond our Retaliation. And it may be, when We &s;eriou&s;ly reflect, our own Hearts reproach Us for many Omi&s;&s;ions of filial Duty in Her Life-time, and that We have not given &s;uch Proofs of our Love to Her, Care of Her, and Delight in Her, as were due from Us. We &s;hou'd therefore now endea|vour to <HI>repair former Defects</HI> by this la&s;t and &s;o|lemn In&s;tance of Love and Re&s;pect. Let Her die <HI>lamented,</HI> to &s;hew that &s;he liv'd <HI>de&s;ir'd,</HI> Let Her Death be a Grief to Us, to &s;how that Her Life was a Joy to Us. We &s;hou'd account our good Mothers <HI>worthy of this double Honour</HI>; and are inexcu&s;able, if We do not pay it Them.</P>
<P N="7">VIII. <HI>WE have Scripture-Example to argue for this mourning the Death of our gracious Mothers.</HI> I &s;hall mention only one In&s;tance; and that is <HI>I&s;aac</HI> mourning for his Mother <HI>Sarah.</HI> This is intimated in <HI>Gen.</HI> 24.67. <HI>I&s;aac</HI> brought Her into his Mother <HI>Sarah's</HI> Tent, and took <HI>Rebekah</HI> and &s;he became his Wife; and He loved Her: And <HI>I&s;aac was comforted after his Mother's Death.

off till now. It continued till the Comfort of a <HI>new</HI> and <HI>nearer</HI> Relation was brought in to ballance it. Truly an affectionate and dutiful Son was <HI>I&s;aac</HI> to His Mother while living, and an hearty Mourner for Her when dead.</P>
<P>NOW this was written <HI>for our En&s;ample and Admonition.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus I have &s;hown, That it is lawful and proper, yea a Duty to mourn the Lo&s;s of a dear and gracious Mother. I have been longer on this Point than I de&s;ign'd, and it may be al&s;o than there was need, e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. Tho' many times, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, there &s;eems to be too much nece&s;&s;ity for the pre&s;&s;ing and incul|cating this Duty on the carele&s;s Po&s;terity of &s;ome Pious Women, upon the like occa&s;ion. Indeed Children's Love and Regard to their Parents li|ving or dead, commonly needs a Spur, tho' the Parents too often need a Curb.</P>
<P>BUT now being convinced of the Duty; our Concern is to know, <HI>How we may di&s;charge it aright.</HI> I &s;hall therefore briefly hint at one or two nece&s;|&s;ary Qualifications of this Mourning.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>IT mu&s;t be well-grounded, and flow from Re|ligious Principles.</HI></P>
<P>I might in the fir&s;t Place have &s;aid, It mu&s;t be a <HI>Real</HI> and &s;olid Grief; not an airy Pretence and affected Shew. It mu&s;t be inward, and not lie merely in Words and Actions. <HI>The Heart must be full</HI>; Impre&s;&s;ions within agreeable to Ex|pre&s;&s;ions without. But this is not all: It mu&s;t be a <HI>Religious</HI> Grief; Voluntary and Cho&s;en, Intelli|gent and Rational, Pious and Devout; It mu&s;t be a gracious Pa&s;&s;ion, rais'd upon &s;piritual Principles and Views.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002218_0028_0FDAD0711287E580"><HI>FAITH</HI> in the Providence of GOD mu&s;t lie in the Foundation of this &s;orrow. In the Mourning our Lo&s;s, there mu&s;t be a Re&s;pect to the original efficient Cau&s;e, and an acknowlegement of the Divine Dominion over Us and all our En|joyments. We mu&s;t &s;ee the <HI>Providence of GOD</HI> in the Bereavement; and it mu&s;t be very hum|bling to Us, to con&s;ider the <HI>Hand that &s;mites us.</HI></P>
<P>THERE mu&s;t be the <HI>Fear</HI> of GOD in Exer|ci&s;e, and a <HI>Sen&s;e of His Di&s;plea&s;ure,</HI> &s;itting heavy upon Us. An Apprehen&s;ion of the Frown and Rebuke of Divide Providence in the Affliction, &s;hould move the inward Springs of Pa&s;&s;ion, and more &s;en&s;ibly affect Us than the outward Trou|ble however &s;evere and piercing. And the Con|&s;ideration of <HI>our Guilt and Demerits</HI> &s;hould yet more deeply affect our Hearts, &s;harpen our Re|&s;entments and fill Us with Bitterne&s;s of Soul. Sin, the de&s;erving Cau&s;e of our Affliction, mu&s;t &s;ting our Brea&s;ts and tear our Bowels.</P>
<P>AND further, Our Grief mu&s;t be animated by a Principle of <HI>Love</HI> to GOD, The Rea&s;on of our Mourning mu&s;t not be &s;o much the Lo&s;s of a mere Creature-comfort, as that We are depriv'd of a Ble&s;&s;ing, in which We &s;aw and enjoy'd much of GOD. We mu&s;t <HI>lament after GOD,</HI> who in the Re|moval of pious and u&s;eful Per&s;ons, &s;o far withdraws Him&s;elf, &amp; calls home His Spirit. This Tho't mu&s;t give a peculiar Accent to our Lamentations, that <HI>a Godly</HI> Per&s;on is cea&s;ed, who had much of the Pre|&s;ence of GOD with Her, and was a rich Ble&s;&s;ing to Us on Spiritual Accounts; and by who&s;e Death &s;o much of our Defen&s;e &amp; Glory is departed, and &s;o much of our Spiritual Stock of Gifts and Graces,
<PB N="22" REF="002218_0029_0FDAD04F53557A68">
Prayers and Services gone; that one Token of the Divine Pre&s;ence is taken away, and one Stream from the Fountain of living Waters dried up, which was a Refre&s;hment and a Furtherance to Us in the Way of Life. &mdash; This is to mourn <HI>after</HI> GOD, and <HI>according to</HI> GOD, when mourn|ing under Bereavements. &mdash; Thus Love to GOD, mu&s;t be the Root of our Sorrow.</P>
<P>AGAIN, There mu&s;t be <HI>a Spirit of Obedience</HI> acting of Us. Our Mourning mu&s;t be from Con&s;cience of Duty, &amp; in Submi&s;&s;ion to GOD's Authority, who expects and demands This of Us. Our mourning the Death of a gracious Parent &s;hould be in Obedi|ence to the 5th Command, which (as hath been ob|&s;erv'd) requires Us to pay this our la&s;t &s;olemn Re|&s;pect &amp; Duty to our Father &amp; Mother. It mu&s;t al&s;o be with <HI>&s;incere Aims</HI> at the Glory of GOD, (which our Chri&s;tian Mourning under &s;uch a frowning Providence hath various ways an A&s;pect upon) and not merely in Compliance with the Impul&s;es of Nature, or with the decent U&s;age of the World.</P>
<P>THUS We mu&s;t be influenced by Spiritual Principles and Motives in our Lamenting the Death of a pious Mother. El&s;e tho' natural Af|fection may work a little, It is but as the Groan|ing &amp; Howling of the Bea&s;ts that have no Under|&s;tanding. Our Grief is but a carnal, ab&s;urd and in|&s;ignificant Pa&s;&s;ion; and profiteth us nothing. And indeed unle&s;s We are moved by &s;uch Religious Principles, it will be exceeding difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to <HI>govern</HI> our Sorrow aright; which is another Thing incumbent on Us. Wherefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>OUR Mourning mu&s;t be well regulated</HI>; and that both as to the Degree and the Duration.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002218_0030_0FDAD0729176D340"><HI>AS to the Degree</HI>; This mu&s;t be proportio|nable to the occasion; a great Lamentation, an|&s;werable to the Greatne&s;s of the Lo&s;s: Our Sor|row in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e (the Death of a wi&s;e, good and excellent Mother) mu&s;t be very <HI>deep</HI> and <HI>pungent.</HI> This is a ju&s;t Debt of Honour to the Memory of the Dead, who&s;e Relation to Us was &s;uperior and nearer than mo&s;t, and a due Reve|rence to the Hand of GOD, the Blow whereof now comes nigher to Us, and lies heavier upon Us, than in mo&s;t other Ca&s;es. This is intimated in the the Text, <HI>I bowed heavily,</HI> as one that mourn|eth for his Mother. And yet We mu&s;t carefully watch again&s;t <HI>Exce&s;s,</HI> and all the Signs of it, as Rage, De&s;pair, Neglect of Duty, Ingratitude for Mercies continued, and the like.</P>
<P>OUR Sorrow is inordinate, when it exceeds the ju&s;t Merits of the Cau&s;e; &s;o when our private Grief excludes the &s;en&s;e of Public Calamitys; when it cau&s;es a Bruti&s;h Oblivion of former Mercies and a ba&s;e Contempt of pre&s;ent Enjoyments; when it unfits Us for, diverts Us from, or di&s;tracts Us in the Duties of our Civil or Chri&s;tian Calling; when it breaks our Health, and our Spirits &s;ink under oppre&s;&s;ive Heavine&s;s; when we voluntarily amplify and aggravate our Affliction, give Way to and delight in Melancholy, and fooli&s;hly cheri&s;h our di&s;con&s;olate Frames by one unhappy Method and another, refu&s;e to be comforted, and are deaf to &s;uch Con&s;iderations as tend to &s;uppre&s;s or allay our Sorrow: When We &s;uffer our Grief to dege|nerate into &s;ullen Di&s;content, impatient Froward|ne&s;s, or angry Murmur again&s;t Divine Provi|dence; and break out into extravagant Speeches

or turbulent Actions. When it is thus with Us; onr Sorrow is exorbitant, and &s;wells beyond it's proper Banks, And &s;uch intemperate Grief in all the Signs and Expre&s;&s;ions of it, is to be mo&s;t heed|fully guarded again&s;t, let the Bereavement We are under be attended with never &s;uch wounding Aggravations. <HI>Surely it is meet to be &s;aid unto GOD, I have borne Cha&s;ti&s;ement; I will bear the Indignation of the Lord</HI>; and truly, <HI>it is good for a Man, that He</HI> patiently and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively <HI>bear the Yoke in His Youth.</HI> We mu&s;t take heed, that we do not fret and fume and fling as the Wild Bull in a Net, or be untractable as the wild A&s;s which is u&s;ed to the Wilderne&s;s. We mu&s;t not <HI>Roar like Bears</HI> (as the Prophet &s;peaks) but <HI>Mourn &s;ore like Doves,</HI> with a humble and quiet Spirit. There mu&s;t be a <HI>Chri&s;tian Calm</HI> in the Mind, and <HI>quiet Re&s;ignation</HI> to the Will of GOD; as becomes tho&s;e who believe His Sovereignty, Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s an Faithfulne&s;s to His Promi&s;es; and as becomes tho&s;e <HI>who are not as others, without Hope.</HI> We mu&s;t not mourn as blind and ignorant Heathen, who were Strangers to the Faith and Hope of the Go&s;pel, for &s;uch as die in the Lord. We mu&s;t calm our ruffled Pa&s;&s;ions, and ea&s;e our oppre&s;&s;ed Minds by con&s;idering <HI>the De&s;igns of Providence,</HI> and <HI>the Encouragements of the Go&s;pel.</HI> Concerning them who &s;leep in Je&s;us, We believe that they are remov'd from us to their un&s;peakable Gain, receiv'd to Glory, tran&s;lated to a better Country, even an Heavenly. And concerning our &s;elves, We have Hope, that GOD will &s;anctify their Death unto Us for Spiritual Profit, and repair the Lo&s;s with unperi&s;hable Ble&s;&s;ings in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and
<PB N="25" REF="002218_0032_0FDAD07410F4ED58">
there is Hope, if We are Followers of Them who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promi&s;es, that We &s;hall with &s;ongs of Joy meet them in Heaven again, never (never) to part more.&mdash; And now with the&s;e Hopes We &s;hou'd temper our Grief, mo|derate our &s;welling Pa&s;&s;ions, and bank up our flow|ing Tears, at the Decea&s;e of our wi&s;e and holy and excellent Parents.&mdash; Thus as to the Mea&s;ure, our Grief mu&s;t be under the Re&s;traints of Rea&s;on and Grace.</P>
<P><HI>SO as to the Duration.</HI> Our Grief mu&s;t neither be of too <HI>&s;hort,</HI> nor of too <HI>long</HI> a Continuance. On the pre&s;ent <HI>extraordinary</HI> Occa&s;ion, before it mu&s;t not be a <HI>tran&s;ient Pang</HI> of &s;orrow: but there mu&s;t be a la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a Providence. We mu&s;t not &s;oon forget our Affliction and let our &s;orrowful Re&s;entments quickly cool and die away. <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Grief for His Mother's Death was not worn off of a long Time, as was ob&s;erved before. &mdash; Neverthe|le&s;s, It mu&s;t not (neither) be an <HI>ob&s;tinate Cour&s;e</HI> of re&s;tle&s;s Melancholy, as if the Lo&s;s were inva|luable and irreparable. No; this re&s;olved, fixed, Grief can't be reconcil'd with Chri&s;tian Submi&s;&s;ion, and therefore is not to be indulged. Tho' it is lawful and prudent to let Nature have it's ge|nuine Operation, and breath out it's Grief with freedom; yet &s;anctify'd Rea&s;on mu&s;t &s;et the Bounds both as to Degree &amp; Duration. The Wi&s;dom that is from above mu&s;t limit the Time of our Funeral-&s;orrows, by regarding the Rules of <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>De|cency.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus I have &s;hown, How &amp; Why We are to mourn the Death of a gracious Mother.</P>

<P>THUS, <HI>Under this &s;orrowful Bereavement, We mu&s;t be &s;trict and &s;erious in Self-Examination, with reference to our Conduct in the Relation of Children to the Decea&s;ed.</HI> We mu&s;t examine our &s;elves and try our Ways, with Diligence and Impartiality.

If We have err'd, in an inordinate Love to, Delight in, and Depen|dence on our decea&s;ed Parent, while with Us; or if We have &s;lighted Her, been di&s;obedient to Her, under-valu'd the Mercy of GOD to Us in Her, and not &s;ought the Good by Her that was to be gotten, We mu&s;t lay it to Heart now We are mourning Her Decea&s;e&punc; We mu&s;t humble our &s;elves before GOD for all the Follys and Failings of every Kind, which we &s;tand chargeable with.</P>
<P>I will here take Leave to tran&s;cribe a Pa&s;&s;age to my Purpo&s;e, out of an excellent Author, which has occurr'd to me &s;ince the Delivering my Sermon: <Q>Children &s;hould con&s;ider upon the Death of <HI>Holy Parents,</HI> in what In&s;tances They failed of

<P>WE &s;hould hear the Voice of GOD, and &s;tudy to an&s;wer His Call in the pre&s;ent Vi&s;itation, by &s;incerely Repenting of all our Mi&s;demeanours, in the Character of Children. We mu&s;t <HI>Sorrow to Repentance</HI>; this is to be &s;orry <HI>after a godly man|ner,</HI> as is hinted, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.9. We mu&s;t pur&s;ue one Grief with another, Natural with Spiritual. This is a Diver&s;ion of our Re&s;entments to the right Object. When We turn the Current of our Grief, upon Sin, (from the Effect to the Cau&s;e) then our Tears run in their proper Channel. <HI>The Sorrow of this World, worketh Death</HI>; but <HI>Godly Sorrow worketh Repentance unto Life.</HI> As, when a

<P>THUS our Sorrow for the Bereavement, mu&s;t be follow'd with Sorrow for our Sins, which have pro|voked GOD to contend with Us by &s;o awful and awakening a Providence. And with Repentance toward GOD, there mu&s;t be Faith towards our Lord JESUS CHRIST, whereby We rely on Him for the Remi&s;&s;ion of our Sins thro' His Blood.</P>

<HEAD>AN <HI>ADDITION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE foregoing Sermon on the Death of my late honoured Mother, was de&s;ign'd &amp; calcu|lated more for the <HI>In&s;truction</HI> &amp; <HI>Edification</HI> of the Living, than the <HI>Commendation</HI> of the Dead. Yet from the few <HI>occa&s;ional Hints</HI> inter&s;per&s;ed in the Di&s;cour&s;e, (tho' not particularly apply'd to <HI>Her,</HI> becau&s;e in General applicable to and intended for the <HI>other</HI> excellent Gentlewomen, (Her dear Friends in Heaven before Her,) whom I did al&s;o de&s;ign to commemorate, and for the Lo&s;s of whom our Tears are &s;et a flowing afre&s;h by this repeated &s;troke,) I &s;ay, from the few loo&s;e Hints given in the Di&s;|cour&s;e, We may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure form Her Cha|racter. I did not aim at a full exact Portraiture and De&s;cription of Her: or if I did, I'm &s;ure I have wonderfully fallen &s;hort, and mi&s;carry'd in the Attempt. What has been &s;aid might here be <HI>confirm'd,</HI> and Abundance more be <HI>added</HI> with great Truth and Ju&s;tice. But I confe&s;s, I am afraid to <HI>enlarge</HI> any further in Her ju&s;t Prai&s;es, le&s;t They, that <HI>know Her not,</HI> &s;hou'd tax my Veracity, and i|magine me to be brib'd &amp; bias'd by my Affection and Relation to Her.

Her Prai&s;e: and to Them I leave it to tell, Why They will &s;o readily own, She was di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the greate&s;t Part of Her Sex, and had not ma|ny Equals.&mdash;Only I will venture my &s;elf to &s;ay, That few, I believe, have pa&s;&s;ed through the World with greater Repute, and more general E&s;teem, or more fully come up to the rare Character of the <HI>Vir|tuous Woman,</HI> given by the Wi&s;e <HI>Prophete&s;s</HI> in the la&s;t Chapter of the Proverbs. She was indeed blamele&s;s and greatly beloved from Her Youth up. She was (as I'm told by yet-living Witne&s;&s;es) an apt, a grave, a very promi&s;ing and de&s;irable <HI>Child</HI>; and as She grew in Years, &s;o &s;he <HI>increa&s;ed in Wi&s;dom,</HI> and <HI>in Favour with GOD and Man.</HI>&mdash; She had the Happine&s;s to be born of <HI>excellent Pa|rents,</HI> (Two of the mo&s;t eminent Chri&s;tians in Their Day,) who took great Care not only for Her <HI>polite</HI> Breeding, but her <HI>religious</HI> Education; and <HI>the &s;ame unfeigned Faith,</HI> that dwelt in them, was found in Her al&s;o.

She was a Pattern of &s;trict Virtue, Morality, and good Carriage. And as bright an Example of Piety and Devotion; early addicting Her Self to Retirement for Clo&s;et-Duties; Delighting in Prayer &amp; Meditation, in Reading and Hearing GOD's Word, and in religious Ac|quaintance, and Conference with good People.&mdash; And Her Piety was <HI>undi&s;&s;embled</HI>; a vital Reality, built on &s;olid Principles, in&s;pir'd from Above. Her

Religion was not <HI>Superficial:</HI> but <HI>internal,</HI> and <HI>deep-laid</HI> on a good <HI>Foundation of Repentance from dead Works, and of Faith towards GOD.</HI> She was the Eternal <HI>King's Daughter,</HI> by Spiritual Regenerati|on; and therefore <HI>glorious within</HI>; which was the Character (She has plea&s;antly told Me) a Pious Mi|ni&s;ter once complemented Her with, when Young.

And (as I've known Her humbly own with admiring Prai&s;es of the Divine Goodne&s;s to Her) She had, in Her Youth, <HI>a good Hope thro' Grace</HI>; and was per|&s;uaded of a &s;aving Work of the Spirit in Her, upon &s;earching Her Heart, and examining Her &s;elf by the Characters of the Regenerate laid down in the Scriptures, and comparing Her own Experiences with tho&s;e of other true Penitents.&mdash; And as She was an <HI>Early Convert,</HI> &s;o by a patient Continu|ance in Well-doing She came to be <HI>an Eminent Saint.</HI> She was a rare Pattern of &s;tedfa&s;t Per&s;eve|rance, and Growth in Grace. And (which is all I &s;hall add concerning Her Life) in the &s;everal Rela|tions, that She came into, She was very Exemplary to the la&s;t; She died <HI>well reported of for good Works</HI>; having been <HI>obedient to Her own Husband</HI>; having <HI>brought up Children</HI>; and <HI>guided well Her Hou&s;e</HI>; having <HI>lodged Strangers</HI>; having <HI>wa&s;hed the Saints Feet</HI>; having <HI>reliev'd the Afflicted</HI>; and <HI>diligently follow'd every good Work.</HI></P>
<P>AND what now remains, but to &s;ay &s;omething about the <HI>Manner of Her Death</HI>; Her Frame and Carriage in Her la&s;t Hours?

<PB N="40" REF="002218_0047_0FDAD05CD1092CF0">
be proper for our Imitation, Encouragement and Quickning.</P>
<P>HER <HI>Patience</HI> was truly admirable. She was exercis'd for &s;ome Time with great, continual and very tedious Pains, which were a &s;ufficient Trial of Her Patience; But She bore all with a Chri&s;tian Silence and &s;teddy Calmne&s;s &amp; Firmne&s;s of Spirit. And when a very &s;hocking Turn &s;ometimes forced Her to li&s;p out a Complaint of, <HI>Pain, Pain</HI>! She wou'd in&s;tantly correct Her &s;elf, and rebuke Her [&s;eeming] Impatience; &s;aying, <Q>But 'tis my heavenly Father, who is thus cha&s;tning of Me, and I de&s;erve it, &mdash; I de&s;erve what is infinitely wor&s;e. And I hope all is meant unto Good.</Q> Once in &s;ome of Her la&s;t Moments, She &s;pake out with a plea&s;ant Look &amp; Tone, &s;aying, <HI>O this is incomparable Pain</HI>! &mdash;and repeated the &s;urpri&s;ing Expre&s;&s;ion. She had almo&s;t an invincible Fortitude of Mind. She wai|ted on the Lord, and He &s;trengthen'd Her.</P>
<P>AND Her <HI>Re&s;ignation</HI> was as remarkable. Her often-repeated Words were, <Q>I freely &s;ubmit to the Will of my heavenly Father, whether for Life or Death. I'm content; His Will be done! I am willing to die; or if it be His Plea&s;ure that I &s;hall live &s;till and &s;uffer, I am al&s;o willing. I leave my &s;elf wholly to His alwi&s;e Di&s;po&s;e.</Q> Only She added, <Q>Let GOD be with Me, and help Me to en|dure to the End!</Q></P>
<P>HER <HI>Contempt of the World</HI> was &s;ingular. She was got above the De&s;ire &amp; Love of Life. Once on my putting the Que&s;tion to Her; <HI>If She de&s;ir'd to live any longer here, Upon what Motive it was</HI>? She reply'd with a certain Vehemence, (that &s;pake Her Sincerity,) <HI>"I don't de&s;ire it at all, Child.</HI> &mdash;
<PB N="41" REF="002218_0048_0FDAD08064D342E8">
Only She added this &s;utable Corrective; <Q>I &s;ub|mit intirely to the Will of GOD; I am willing to live &amp; &s;uffer yet, if He will be with me.</Q> &mdash; Once She &s;eem'd to <HI>forbid</HI> us to pray for Her being any longer ab&s;ent from the Lord. And it is remarkable that when ask'd, What &s;pecial Petitions She would have put up for Her? I don't remember, that She at any time mentioned <HI>Recovery</HI>: but Par|don, and Acceptance with GOD, and His gracious &s;anctifying and comforting Pre&s;ence with Her, were the Sum of Her De&s;ires.&mdash;When her Indi&s;po&s;ition <HI>began</HI> to grow upon Her, She was apprehen&s;ive of Death's Approach, and &s;aid, <Q>I have done with this World; all my Concern now is to &s;ee my way &s;afe and clear out of it.</Q></P>
<P>SHE was in a very <HI>humble, lowly, and penitent Frame.</HI> She abhorr'd Her &s;elf, and repented in Du&s;t &amp; A&s;hes. She &s;aid, <Q><HI>GOD is now cha&s;tning me for Sin. I de&s;erve all this, &amp; Infinitely more.</HI></Q>&mdash; Upon which I ask'd Her, Whether She &s;pake of any more heinous Provocation, which She tho't might be the particular procuring Cau&s;e of this Vi&s;itation: But She an&s;wer'd with great Mode&s;ty in the <HI>Nega|tive</HI>; &s;aying, <Q>No, No; I ble&s;s GOD, who by His Grace hath kept Me. I can't accu&s;e my &s;elf of al|low'd heinous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, nor do I know of any Sin unrepented of.</Q>&mdash;Still She &s;aid, She de&s;erv'd all that was laid upon Her; and that was Her Pe|tition, <Q>Lord, Hear in Heaven, and Forgive, For|give, and do, for thy mercy's &s;ake.</Q></P>
<P>AGAIN, The <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> was in a very vigo|rous Exerci&s;e. She had a powerful &s;en&s;e of GOD on Her Mind, the highe&s;t Reverence of His awful Maje&s;ty, and a becoming Dread of His terrible Di&s;|plea&s;ure.
<PB N="42" REF="002218_0049_0FDAD08D915C7158">
It was a great Expre&s;&s;ion of Her's; <Q>Leaving this World is nothing to Me, Putting off this Body &s;eems nothing to Me; but <HI>(being jealous over her &s;elf with a godly Jealou&s;y, as becomes the be&s;t &amp; brighte&s;t Saint on this &s;ide Heaven, She add|ed,)</HI> To think of going into the Pre&s;ence of an in|finitely holy and Heart-&s;earching Judge, This makes me blu&s;h and tremble.</Q></P>
<P>SHE had a &s;trong &amp; genuine <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t.</HI> She &s;aid, <Q>I am a poor unprofitable Servant, and have Nothing to boa&s;t of. Free Favour is my only Re|fuge. I have nothing to depend on, but the free Mercy of God in Chri&s;t; and in that I tru&s;t.</Q> &mdash; She thus expre&s;s'd Her Faith in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t alone for Ju&s;tification; renouncing all Dependence on Her own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as a &s;andy Foundation, that, if tru&s;ted to, would deceive Her into Ruin; realizing it, (as I have known Her &s;ome|times to expre&s;s Her &s;elf,) that the Imperfections attending Her be&s;t Obedience were enough, to pro|voke the holy GOD to condemn Her, though She were guilty of no other Sins; and that nothing but the Merits and Interce&s;&s;ion of CHRIST were to be rely'd upon.&mdash; She al&s;o acted Faith in CHRIST, as Her <HI>Strength,</HI> as well as Righteou&s;ne&s;s, often calling upon Him in &s;uch Terms as the&s;e; &mdash; <Q>O my compa&s;&s;ionate High-Prie&s;t, my Strong Redeemer, Help Me, Help Me, O my Compa&s;&s;io|nate Saviour! Put underneath thine everla&s;ting Arms, &s;upport and &s;ave Me.</Q>&mdash; It might have been &s;aid unto Her, <HI>O Woman great is thy Faith</HI>!</P>
<P>AGAIN, <HI>Love</HI> to Her GOD, and SAVIOUR, was now kindled into a Flame.</P>
<P>WHEN I was once endeavouring to a&s;&s;i&s;t Her in
<PB N="43" REF="002218_0050_0FDAD081939D54F0">
clearing up the Evidences of Her Adoption, among other Que&s;tions of Trial, I ask'd Her, Whether She cou'd heartily joyn with the P&s;almi&s;t in &s;aying to GOD, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee,</HI> &mdash; Here She prevented me and &s;aid, <Q>Yes, Yes, and there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides Him!</Q> &mdash; Her Heart was full of holy Longings after GOD. She often breath'd out her flaming De&s;ires in &s;uch pa|thetical Expre&s;&s;ions as tho&s;e; <Q>Lord, Lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance. O let thy Face &s;hine upon me, and be merciful unto me. O my GOD, I am ca&s;t down; Thou &s;ette&s;t Me in Darkne&s;s; Thou hide&s;t thy face from Me: and what &s;hall I do? Mine Eyes are unto Thee. I cry to Thee, O my GOD, in the Day-time, and in the Night: but Thou an&s;were&s;t Me not. O my GOD, in Thy Fa|vour is Life.</Q> <HI>Crown Me with thy Loving kindne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>HER Love to CHRIST was in a fervent Operation. She expre&s;t the highe&s;t E&s;teem of Him, the &s;tronge&s;t De&s;ire towards Him. Once on Her &s;aying, <Q>O my precious Saviour, Look on me with an Eye of Pity!</Q> &mdash; I took Occa&s;ion (with a View to helping Her di&s;|cern one Evidence of Her Faith in Chri&s;t,) to re|peat to Her that Scripture, <HI>To Them that believe, He is precious</HI>:&mdash; Upon which, She expre&s;s'd Her admiring &s;en&s;e hereof, &s;aying, <Q>O how precious! He is altogether lovely!</Q> &mdash; She &s;aid that, <Q>The Enjoyment of Chri&s;t was all Her De&s;ire. <HI>And that,</HI> This whole World was Nothing, Nothing to an In|tere&s;t in Chri&s;t.</Q> And that, <Q>If She might but go to be with Chri&s;t, that wou'd be infinitely better than being here.</Q></P>
<P>MOREOVER, Her <HI>Hope &amp; Confidence in GOD</HI> did not fail. She had liv'd a Life of Dependence
<PB N="44" REF="002218_0051_0FDAD08F1287E198">
on GOD &amp; made Him Her Tru&s;t from Her Youth: and She had been begotten to a lively Hope of Salvation. And now the Time was come that She mu&s;t die, She had the Hope of the Righteous and the Peace of the Upright in Her End. She was not indeed one of them who have <HI>no Bands in their Death</HI>&punc; nor of that happy Number, who have the full A&s;&s;urance of Faith and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. Yet once (I remember) after a long &s;ilence (when I pre&s;ume She had been deeply engag'd in Meditation and Prayer) She &s;uddenly open'd Her Eyes and with a kind of Tran&s;port utter'd the&s;e Words, <Q>Now I have hold of Him, Now I've Hold on him. O let Him never leave me! Let me never lo&s;e my Confidence in him!</Q> &mdash; Yet the Clouds &s;oon return'd after the Rain. Humble Doubts and Fears prevailed; and &s;ometimes She was in great Dark|ne&s;s. One wou'd have expected indeed that &s;uch on extraordinary Life of Holine&s;s and Communion with GOD as She had led, &s;hou'd have terminated in a mo&s;t comfortable &amp; joyful Death. Yet GOD, who exerci&s;es a Sovereign Liberty in the Di&s;pen&s;a|tion of His Comforts, was plea&s;ed to order it other|wi&s;e with this humble contrite Chri&s;tian. She was full of &s;elf-diffidence &amp; the deepe&s;t &s;elf-aba&s;ement to the la&s;t: And yet in the mid&s;t of all Her Dark|ne&s;s and greate&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s, She had Faith in a lively Exerci&s;e, and &s;ome mixture of Hope, which was as an Anchor to Her Soul, and kept Her from being over-&s;et with her oppre&s;&s;ive Fear &amp; Grief. She al|ways call'd on GOD, as <HI>Her</HI> GOD, with a hum|ble Familiarity, and an ob&s;ervable Empha&s;is. She often u&s;ed the&s;e Words in the Agonies of Her <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Faith. <Q>My GOD help me. My com|pa&s;&s;ionate

Father help me. I have tru&s;ted in Thee, my GOD; let me never be put to Confu&s;ion. I hope in thee my GOD; let me never be confounded.</Q></P>
<P>ONCE in a continuing Fit of acute Pain, She thus expre&s;&s;ed Her Tru&s;t in GOD; <Q>I am in Pain: What &s;hall I do? I am weary with my Groaning all the Day. O Lord, mine Eyes are upon Thee. Lord, &s;trengthen Me. O Lord, my Hope is in Thee; whither el&s;e &s;hould I go? In Thee do I tru&s;t: I have tru&s;ted in Thee: I mu&s;t tru&s;t in Thee; and I will. Yea tho' thou &s;laye&s;t Me, yet will I tru&s;t in Thee.</Q> &mdash; Which la&s;t Words (the Words of Holy <HI>Job</HI> in his Affliction) She often u&s;ed. &mdash; Under the &s;en&s;e of Her unu&s;ual Darkne&s;s of Mind and Dullne&s;s of Affection, The&s;e were &s;ome of the admirable Breathings of Her un&s;haken Tru&s;t &amp; Re|&s;ignation; <Q>My GOD! Thou hide&s;t thy Face from me, Thou make&s;t me walk in Darkne&s;s. But I &s;ubmit: I'm content, I'm content. I am at thine al-wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;e. I de&s;ire the Light of thy Countenance&punc; and value it above this whole World: but if Thou &s;halt &s;ee meet still to hide thy Face from Met, I &s;ubmit, I &s;ubmit to thy Holy Will. Only I will yet hope. On Thee my GOD do I wait all the Day long. I hope I &s;hall yet prai&s;e Thee.</Q></P>
<P>AT another Time (the la&s;t Opportunity I had of &s;peaking with Her,) She &s;eem'd to have a more com|fortable and chearful Hope: The&s;e were &s;ome of Her Words, <Q>I hope in my GOD. O my &s;trong Tower and Defen&s;e! I hope in Thee, my GOD. I now hope, and this is my Refre&s;hment.</Q> &mdash; And again, She &s;aid, <Q>O my GOD, Thou art my only Hope and Confidence. Thou &s;upporte&s;t and &s;trengthene&s;t me, and builde&s;t me up in my Faith.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002218_0053_0FDAD09092823C48">AND again, When She was in the apprehen&s;ion of Tho&s;e about Her, drawing near to the Clo&s;e of Her Life, My Father to mini&s;ter to Her Support, repeated &s;ome Part of the 23d P&s;alm, and as He was &s;aying tho&s;e Words, <HI>When I walk thro' the Valley of the &s;hadow of Death, I will fear no Evil; for thou art with Me,</HI> &mdash;. She interrupted Him, and &s;upplied the Re&s;t, &s;aying, <Q>Thy Rod and thy Staff, they comfort Me &mdash;.</Q> She was heard to &s;ay divers Times, <Q>Come, come, come: How long, how long?</Q> &mdash; Thus it &s;eems, the Clouds pa&s;&s;ed away at the Approach of Death, and <HI>at E|vening there was Light.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I remember, whenever She had any <HI>Revi|ving,</HI> She was continually &s;ollicitous le&s;t She &s;hould be deceived. She wou'd often pray, <Q>O let not my Hope make Me a&s;hamed. Let it not be the Hope of the Hypocrite, that &s;hall peri&s;h!</Q> Tho' once She added, <Q>It can't be &s;o; I am no Hypo|crite: I know I am not</Q>. And I think it was upon Her uttering the&s;e Words (which She did with an Air of A&s;&s;urance uncommon to Her,) that I ask'd Her, Whether <HI>the Hope She had did &s;erve &s;en&s;ibly to wean Her from this World, and increa&s;e Her Hatred of Sin, and inflame Her De&s;ires towards GOD,</HI> &amp;c. And She an&s;wer'd with Humble Thank|fulne&s;s to GOD, in the <HI>Affirmative.</HI> &mdash; I told Her then Her Hope was certainly the <HI>Fruit of the Spirit, a good Hope,</HI> which wou'd not be di&s;appoin|ted.</P>
<P>AND (to add only a Word or two further) She was full of the tendere&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Love</HI> to every Body, and very <HI>thankful</HI> to Her Friends for their
<PB N="47" REF="002218_0054_0FDAD08494B41C20">
kind Vi&s;its, and for every (the lea&s;t) Service or Office of Love done by any: And never was a Per|&s;on more <HI>lowly-minded</HI>; She was <HI>clothed with Hu|mility</HI>; She cou'd &s;ee nothing in Her &s;elf, (She &s;aid) that &s;hou'd de&s;erve &s;uch Love and Re&s;pect from People, as was &s;hown Her, and admir'd what cou'd be the Rea&s;on of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash; But (what is more) She had a <HI>Divine Zeal</HI> in Exerci&s;e, that put Her upon di&s;pen&s;ing Holy Coun&s;els, Cautions and Encouragements to all about Her, as was need|ful; which She did with great Fidelity and Af|fection, as well as Mode&s;t and Di&s;cretion. How pathetically did She exhort one &amp; another to <HI>Order Their Conver&s;ation as becometh the Go&s;pel, to watch over Them&s;elves, to take Heed to Their ways; and walk in the Way of Truth:</HI> adding once this remar|kable &amp; very moving Expre&s;&s;ion. <HI>"MY GOD will not be mocked, MY GOD will not be mocked.</HI></P>
<P>HER Dying Coun&s;il to Us, Her Children, (which may We never forget!) was that; <Q>O take Heed, take Heed; and be diligent to make your Calling and Election &s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>SHE &s;pake to all in General about a <HI>Death-bed-Repentance,</HI> and gave Warning again&s;t the great but too common Folly of depending on it.</P>
<P>SHE expre&s;&s;ed Her &s;en&s;e of the great Importance of <HI>actual</HI> Readine&s;s for a Dying Hour, and to excite hereto was the Tendency of that Coun&s;il, <Q>Pre|pare to meet thy God, O I&s;rael!</Q> &mdash; Which were &s;ome of her la&s;t Words, and &s;poken with a mo&s;t awful accent and a&s;pect.</P>
<P>FURTHER, She was full of <HI>Prayer.</HI> She was praying always in the Holy Gho&s;t; being fervent
<PB N="48" REF="002218_0055_0FDAD092115EF1F8">
in Spirit, and with a great Facility pouring out her De&s;ires (chiefly) in Scripture-Expre&s;&s;ions; For her Bible was very familiar to Her, She had from a Child known the holy Scriptures, and taken un|common Pains, to trea&s;ure up the Word of GOD in Her Heart &amp; Memory. She was much in Prayer for <HI>Her &s;elf,</HI> continually looking to and calling upon GOD in CHRIST for Mercy &amp; Grace to help Her. &mdash; She al&s;o prayed for <HI>Others,</HI> Particularly She left Her Ble&s;&s;ing on Her <HI>Children</HI>; when we were &s;tanding round Her Bed, and calling Her Ble&s;&s;ed, acknowleging our Obligations to Her, and expre&s;|&s;ing our deepe&s;t Sympathy with, as well as du|tiful and &s;olemn Wi&s;hes for Her; She cea&s;ed not to pray for <HI>Us,</HI> and to ble&s;s Us in the Name of the Lord, and this not only in General, but in Particular; (not forgetting Tho&s;e of Her Children that were ab&s;ent; and Her Children's Children, even the Children that &s;hall be born;) and the la&s;t Words She was heard to &s;ay, were tho&s;e <Q>Let my Children Live in Love and Peace; and let the GOD of Love and Peace be with them, for Ever and Ever. Amen!</Q></P>
<P>SHE was very de&s;irous of the Benefit of other's Prayers with Her and for Her, while Living.</P>
<P><HI>BUT now no longer</HI>! She is got beyond the Reach, and above the Need of our Prayers. She is gone where She is ea&s;ed of all Her Burdens; where Her Sighs are turned into Songs; Her Griefs and Groans into Joy and Prai&s;e; Her Faith into Vi&s;ion; Her Hope into Fruition; Her Grace into Glory. Having born the Cro&s;s on Earth, She now wears the Crown in Heaven: While <HI>We</HI> are left

behind in Tears, bewailing our Lo&s;s; [a Judgment, I'm humbly &s;en&s;ible, (to &s;peak for my &s;elf) I was too ripe for,] And <HI>not knowing the Things that &s;hall further befall Us.</HI> GOD grant it may not prove &s;uch a <HI>Beginning of &s;orrows,</HI> as the Death of pious <HI>Rachel</HI> was; upon which the Affliction of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in a few Months en&s;u'd! We &s;hou'd therefore humble our &s;elves under the mighty Hand of GOD; and be earne&s;t with Him in Prayer, that He wou'd not proceed in His Controver&s;y with Us. &mdash; Howbeit, if the Spirit of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> (the &s;ame Spirit of Faith and Patience, of Grace and Supplication) does but re&s;t upon Us, what&s;oever may be <HI>the Evil to come,</HI> though We <HI>&s;hould have Sorrow upon Sorrow,</HI> Yet (as <HI>He</HI> &s;aid) <HI>GOD means it unto Good.</HI> If We do but patiently bear, and religiou&s;ly improve afflictive Providences, We &s;hall find by happy Ex|perience, that <HI>Sorrow is better than Laughter,</HI> which is one of the wi&s;e Proverbs of <HI>Solomon,</HI> tho' an uncouth Paradox to the carnally-minded: but when GOD has <HI>fini&s;hed His Work,</HI> the My&s;tery will be unriddled. <HI>The Day &s;hall declare it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT indeed our Concern <HI>now</HI> is not &s;o much, what <HI>ill Events</HI> this Vi&s;itation may be the unhappy Forerunner of, or how We &s;hall be able to bear them; as what <HI>good Account</HI> We &s;hall be able to give up of our Deportment under and Improve|ment of the <HI>pre&s;ent Affliction,</HI> and how We &s;hall apply it to make Us better prepar'd for the <HI>next,</HI> whatever it be. &mdash; O that We may have Wi&s;dom and Grace to demean our &s;elves aright under this heavy Trial, and accommodate our &s;elves to the Intentions of Providence herein; &s;o that tho' <HI>We</HI> are Lo&s;ers in our Comforts, yet <HI>GOD</HI> may be a

Gainer in His Glory! O that We may never forget the wi&s;e Le&s;&s;ons We've been taught, or lo&s;e the holy Impre&s;&s;ions (I hope) We have received, by this mournful Di&s;pen&s;ation! O that hereby our Hearts may be more <HI>loo&s;en'd</HI> from all Earthly Friend&s;hips and Enjoyments! That CHRIST (our be&s;t and never-failing Friend) may be more <HI>en|dear'd</HI> to us; and our Affections more &s;et upon the Things that are un&s;een and Eternal!

What tho' She had not that fullne&s;s of Hope &amp; Com|fort in Her End; but after all Her Diligence to make Her Calling and Election &s;ure, was trou|ble with Doubts and Fears, when She came to die. We mu&s;t not, becau&s;e of This, doom it a vain Thing to take Pains in working out our Sal|vation, nor be di&s;couraged from a Life of Reli|gion. <HI>For</HI> (Remember) <HI>the Cloud had a bright &s;ide</HI>; and notwith&s;tanding all Her Darkne&s;s, She made a <HI>glorious End</HI>; being in the mid&s;t of her greate&s;t Temptations &amp; Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, full of Faith &amp; humble Hope, fervent Love, Prayer and Prai&s;e. And truly it is worth the while to Live over Her &s;trict and holy Life, that We may die Her happy Death, and our la&s;t End be like Her's. &mdash; Let us labour then to get our Souls in&s;pir'd with a noble Emu|lation, and fir'd with a generous Ambition to <HI>be</HI>

and <HI>do</HI> like Her. Let us covet to <HI>equal,</HI> and if it be po&s;&s;ible to <HI>excel</HI> Her in all that was imita|ble both in Her Life and Death.
