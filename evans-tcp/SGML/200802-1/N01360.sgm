<P N="4">IV. To Die Daily, is to <HI>Do Daily</HI> tho&s;e Things, which mu&s;t be done, by every one that would Hope to <HI>Die Safely.

propo&s;e to <HI>Die</HI> in Good Terms with Hea|ven. You &s;hall have it &s;et before you. One Thing is this. He that would be <HI>prepared</HI> for Death, mu&s;t be <HI>Righteous.</HI> We read, Prov. XIV. 32. It is the <HI>Righteous</HI> who has <HI>Hope in his Death.</HI> At our <HI>Death,</HI> we are in an <HI>Hopele&s;s,</HI> Undone, Forlorn plight, if we are not furni&s;hed with a perfect and &s;potle&s;s <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> wherein we may &s;tand before the Judgment Seat of God. We cannot obtain &s;uch a <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> but by Accepting of, and Relying on, that <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which our Saviour has in His <HI>Obedience</HI> as our <HI>Surety</HI> unto God, pro|vided for us. Well then; We mu&s;t by <HI>faith</HI> make our <HI>Daily Flight</HI> unto the <HI>Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of God.</HI> It mu&s;t be our <HI>Daily</HI> cour&s;e, Thankfully, Joyfully, Heartily to <HI>Receive the Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of the Ble&s;&s;ed Je|&s;us, as the <HI>Free Gift</HI> of God, that we may lead it as our Title to Everla&s;ting Hap|pine&s;s.

Thus it is to <HI>Dy Daily.</HI> A|nother Thing is this. He that wou'd be
