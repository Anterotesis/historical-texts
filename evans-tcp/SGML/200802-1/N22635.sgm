<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE revolution in France exhibits a &s;cene, in the political world, not le&s;s novel and intere&s;t|ing than the contra&s;t is &s;triking between the narrow opinions of &s;uper&s;tition, and the enlight|ened &s;entiments of ma&s;culine and improved phi|lo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>To mark the prominent features of this revo|lution, requires a mind, not only un&s;ophi&s;ticated by old prejudices, and the inveterate habits of degeneracy; but an amelioration of temper, pro|duced by the exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t enlarged prin|ciples of humanity.</P>
<P>The rapid changes, the violent, the ba&s;e, and nefarious a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, which have clouded the vivid pro&s;pect that began to &s;pread a ray of joy and gladne&s;s over the gloomy horizon of oppre&s;|&s;ion, cannot fail to chill the &s;ympathizing bo&s;om, and pal&s;y intellectual vigour. To &s;ketch the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes is a ta&s;k &s;o arduous and melancholy,

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat, with a heart trembling at the touches of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ature, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t the erroneous inferences of &s;en&s;ibility; and rea&s;on beaming on the grand theatre of political changes can prove the only &s;ure guide to direct us to a favourable or ju&s;t conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>This important conclu&s;ion, involving the hap|pine&s;s and exaltation of the human character, de|mands &s;erious and mature con&s;ideration; as it mu&s;t ultimately &s;ink the dignity of &s;ociety into contempt, and its members into greater wretched|ne&s;s; or elevate it to a degree of grandeur not hitherto anticipated, but by the mo&s;t enlighten|ed &s;tate&s;men and philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Contemplating then the&s;e &s;tupendous events with the cool eye of ob&s;ervation, the judgment difficult to be pre&s;erved unwarped under the pre&s;&s;ure of the calamitous horrors produced by de&s;perate and enraged factions, will continually perceive that it is the uncontaminated ma&s;s of the French nation, who&s;e minds begin to gra&s;p the &s;entiments of freedom, that has &s;ecured the equi|librium of the &s;tate; often tottering on the brink of annihilation; in &s;pite of the folly, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, madne&s;s, treachery, and more fatal mock patriot|i&s;m, the common re&s;ult of depraved manners,

the concomitant of that &s;ervility and volup tuou&s;ne&s;s which for &s;o long a &s;pace of time has embruted the higher orders of this celebrated nation.</P>
<P>By thus attending to circum&s;tances, we &s;hall be able to di&s;cern clearly that the revolution was neither produced by the abilities or intrigues of a few individuals; nor was the effect of &s;udden and &s;hort-lived enthu&s;ia&s;m; but the natural con|&s;equence of intellectual improvement, gradually proceeding to perfection in the advancement of communities, from a &s;tate of barbari&s;m to that of poli&s;hed &s;ociety, till now arrived at the point when &s;incerity of principles &s;eem to be ha&s;tening the overthrow of the tremendous empire of &s;u|per&s;tition and hypocri&s;y, erected upon the ruins of gothic brutality and ignorance.</P>

<P>WHEN we contemplate the infancy of man, his gradual advance towards maturity, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mi&s;erable weakne&s;s as a &s;olitary being, and the crudene&s;s of his fir&s;t notions re&s;pecting the na|ture of civil &s;ociety, it will not appear extraordi|nary, that the acquirement of political knowledge has been &s;o extremely &s;low; or, that public hap|pine&s;s has not been more rapidly and generally diffu&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="029916_0014_0FE3093B5FE4C3B0">The perfection attained by the ancients, it is true, has ever afforded the imagination of the poetical hi&s;torian a theme to deck with the choice&s;t flowers of rhetoric; though the cool inve&s;ti|gation of facts &s;eems clearly to prove, that the civilization of the world, hitherto, has con&s;i&s;ted rather in cultivating the ta&s;te, than in exerci&s;ing the under&s;tanding. And were not the&s;e vaunted improvements al&s;o confined to a &s;mall corner of the globe, whil&s;t, the political view of the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lators &s;eldom extending beyond the &s;plen|dor and aggrandizement of their individual na|tion, they trampled with a ferocious affectation of patrioti&s;m on the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of humanity? When the arts flouri&s;hed in Greece, and litera|ture began to &s;hed it's blandi&s;hments on &s;ociety, the world was mo&s;tly inhabited by barbarians, who waged eternal war with their more poli&s;hed neighbours, the imperfection of who&s;e govern|ment &s;apping it's foundation, the &s;cience of poli|tics nece&s;&s;arily received a check in the bud&mdash;and when we find, likewi&s;e, the roman empire crum|bling into atoms, from the germ of a deadly ma|lady implanted in it's vitals; whil&s;t voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s &s;topped the progre&s;s of civilization, which makes the perfection of the arts the dawn of &s;ci|ence; we &s;hall be convinced, that it demanded ages of improving rea&s;on and experience in moral philo&s;ophy, to clear away the rubbi&s;h, and ex|hibit the fir&s;t principles of &s;ocial order.</P>
<P>We have probably derived our great &s;uperi|ority over tho&s;e nations from the di&s;covery of the polar attraction of the needle, the perfection which a&s;tronomy and mathematics have attained, and the fortunate invention of printing. For,

<P>Locke, following the track of the&s;e bold think|ers, recommended in a more methodical manner religious toleration, and analyzed the principles of civil liberty: for in his definition of liberty we find the elements of <HI>The Declaration of the Rights of Man,</HI> which, in &s;pite of the fatal errors of ignorance, and the perver&s;e ob&s;tinacy of &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, is now converting &s;ublime theories into practical truths.</P>

<P>DURING this general depravation of man|ners, the young and beautiful <HI>dauphine</HI> arrived; and was received with a kind of idolatrous ado|ration, only to be &s;een in France; for the in|habitants of the metropolis, literally &s;peaking, could think and talk of nothing el&s;e; and in their eagerne&s;s to pay homage, or gratify af|fectionate curio&s;ity, an immen&s;e number were killed.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a voluptuous atmo&s;phere, how could &s;he e&s;cape contagion? The pro&s;ligacy of Louis XIV. when love and war were his amu&s;ements, was &s;oberne&s;s, compared with the capricious intemperance of the inebriated imagination at this period. Madame du Barry was then in the zenith of her power, which quickly excited the jealou&s;y of this prince&s;s who&s;e &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion was that
<PB N="25" REF="029916_0037_0FE3091CECE145E8">
intolerable family pride, which heated the blood of the whole hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. An inclination for court intrigue, under the ma&s;k of the mo&s;t profound di&s;&s;imulation, to pre&s;erve the favour of Louis XV. was in&s;tantly called into action; and it &s;oon became the only bu&s;ine&s;s of life, either to gratify re&s;entment, or cheat the &s;atiety, which the continual and unre&s;trained indulgence of plea|&s;ure produced.</P>
<P>Her character thus formed, when &s;he became ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s, the court of the pa&s;&s;ive Louis, not only the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute and abandoned that ever di&s;played the folly of royalty, but au|daciou&s;ly negligent with re&s;pect to that attention to decency, which is nece&s;&s;ary to delude the vul|gar, was de&s;erted by all per&s;ons, who had any regard for their moral character, or the decorum of appearances. Con&s;trained by the <HI>etiquette,</HI> which made the principal part of the impo&s;ing grandeur of Louis XIV. the queen wi&s;hed to throw a&s;ide the cumber&s;ome brocade of cere|mony, without having di&s;cernment enough to perceive, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to lend mock dignity to a court, where there was not &s;ufficient virtue, or native beauty, to give intere&s;t or re|&s;pectability to &s;implicity. The harlot is &s;eldom &s;uch a fool as to neglect her meretricious orna|ments, unle&s;s &s;he renounces her trade; and the pageantry of courts is the &s;ame thing on a larger &s;cale. The lively predilection, likewi&s;e, of the queen for her native country, and love for her brother Jo&s;eph, to whom &s;he repeatedly &s;ent con|&s;iderable &s;ums, purloined from the public, ended greatly to in&s;pire the mo&s;t ineffable contempt for royalty, now &s;tript of the frippery which had

In fact, the &s;tate had been fleeced, to &s;upport the unremitting demands of the queen; who would have di&s;membered France, to aggrandize Au&s;tria, and pamper her favour|ites.

<P>The accu&s;ations of La Fayette &s;erved, perhaps, as the o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;on with the public, and even with the king; yet it can hardly be &s;up|po&s;ed, that they had any affect on the cabal, who invented, or connived at the plans nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e a continual &s;upply for their plea&s;ures.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Calonne, M. de Brienne, a man who&s;e talents Turgot had over|rated, was now cho&s;en by the queen, becau&s;e he had formerly &s;econded her views, and was &s;till the ob&s;equious &s;lave of that power, which he had long been courting, to obtain the &s;o much envied place of mini&s;ter. Having taken more pains to gain the po&s;t than to prepare him&s;elf to fulfil it's functions, his weak and timid mind was in a continual tumult; and he adopted with head|long confu&s;ion the taxes propo&s;ed by his prede|ce&s;&s;or; becau&s;e money mu&s;t be had, and he knew not where to turn to procure it by an unhacknied mode of extortion.</P>
<P>The <HI>notables</HI> were now di&s;&s;olved; and it would have been a natural con&s;equence of the di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="36" REF="029916_0048_0FE308AAFB0AA3A8">
of the mini&s;ter who a&s;&s;embled them, even if their &s;pirited inquiries had not rendered their pre&s;ence vexatious to the court. This, how|ever, was an impolitic mea&s;ure; for they returned highly di&s;gu&s;ted to their re&s;pective abodes, to propagate the free opinions, to which re&s;entment and argumentation had given birth.</P>
<P>Before the breaking up of the <HI>notables,</HI> they were neverthele&s;s prevailed upon to recommend a land and &s;tamp tax; and the edicts were &s;ent to the parliament to be enregi&s;tered. But the&s;e magi&s;trates, never forgetting that they enjoyed, in virtue of their office, the privileged exemption from taxes, to elude &s;anctioning the fir&s;t, which was to have been an equal impo&s;t, took advan|tage of the public odiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;econd; thus avoiding, with a &s;how of patrioti&s;m, an avowed oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;t of the people, that would clearly have proved, how much dearer they held their own.</P>
<P>The gaudy and meretricious pageantry of the court was now di&s;played, to intimidate the par|liament, at what was termed a bed of ju&s;tice, though in reality of all ju&s;tice a &s;olemn mockery; and, whil&s;t pretending to con&s;ult them, the edicts were enregi&s;tered by a mandate of &s;tate. The parliament, in the mean time, making a merit of nece&s;&s;ity, declared, that the right of &s;anctioning the impo&s;t belonged only to the &s;tate-general, the convocation of which they demanded. Pro|voked by their &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urdy oppo&s;ition, the court ba|ni&s;hed them to Troyes; and they compromi&s;ed for their recall by enregi&s;tering the prolongation of the <HI>deuxieme vingtieme,</HI> a cowardly de&s;ertion of their former ground.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="029916_0049_0FE309A27338F9E0">A century before (a proof of the progre&s;s of rea&s;on) the people, dige&s;ting their di&s;appointment, would have &s;ubmitted, with brutal acquie&s;cence, to the maje&s;tic WILL of the king, without daring to &s;can it's import; but now, recognizing their own dignity, they in&s;i&s;ted, that all authority, which did not originate with them, was illegal and de&s;potic, and loudly &s;ounded the grand truth&mdash;That it was nece&s;&s;ary to convoke the &s;tates-general. The government, however, like a dying wretch cut off by intemperance, whil&s;t the lu&s;t of enjoyment &s;till remaining prompts him to exhau&s;t his &s;trength by &s;truggling with death, fought &s;ome time longer inau&s;piciou&s;ly for exi&s;tence, depending on the &s;uccour of the court empirics, who vainly flattered them&s;elves, that they could prevent it's di&s;&s;olution, From the moment, indeed, that Brienne &s;ucceeded Ca|lonne, all the machinery, which the demon of de&s;poti&s;m could invent, was put into motion, to divert the current of opinion, bearing on it's fair bo&s;om the new &s;entiments of liberty with irre|&s;i&s;tible force, and overwhelming, as it &s;welled, the peri&s;hing monuments of venerable folly, and the fragile barriers of &s;uper&s;titious igno|rance.</P>
<P>But &s;upplies were &s;till wanting; and the court, being fruitful in &s;tratagems to procure a loan, which was the nece&s;&s;ary lever of it's in&s;idious de&s;igns, coale&s;ced with &s;ome of the members of the parliament, and the agreement was to have been ratified in a <HI>s&eacute;ance royale.</HI> Yet, as the par|liament had determined to be governed by a clear majority, the &s;cheme of the keeper of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ais, who intended to have the bu&s;ine&s;s hurried
<PB N="38" REF="029916_0050_0FE308B3D4EEAC50">
over without telling the votes, was completely defeated.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery of this unfair attempt made the indignant magi&s;trates, glad to &s;eize an occa&s;ion to recover their popularity, maintain with bold|ne&s;s their own character, and the intere&s;t of the people. The duke of Orleans, al&s;o, &s;omewhat tauntingly &s;ugge&s;ting to the king, that this was only another bed of ju&s;tice, was exiled, with two other members, who had remon&s;trated with courage. The&s;e magi&s;trates, now became the objects of public adoration, were con&s;idered by the grateful public as their only bulwark again&s;t the attacks of the mini&s;try; which continued to hara&s;s invention, to contrive means to counteract a concurrence of circum&s;tances, that were driv|ing before them all oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The court, for I con&s;ider the government, at this period completely at an end, continued to &s;tumble out of one blunder into another, till at la&s;t they re&s;ted all their hopes on the popular reforms projected by Brienne, in conjunction with Lamoignon, a man with more &s;trength of character, to cajole the people and cru&s;h the parliament. Several &s;trokes, the feeble blows of angry men, who wi&s;hed &s;till to retain the &s;tolen &s;weets of office, were aimed at this body, calculated to mi&s;lead the people who, were al&s;o promi&s;ed a reformed code of penal laws. But the time when partial remedies would have been eagerly &s;wallowed was pa&s;t, and the people &s;aw di&s;tinctly, that their will would &s;oon be law, and their power omnipotent. But the mini&s;ter, Brienne, not aware of this, to &s;teer clear of further oppo&s;ition, propo&s;ed the plan of a <HI>cour
<PB N="39" REF="029916_0051_0FE309A41181C408">
pl&eacute;niere:</HI> an heterogeneous a&s;&s;embly of princes, nobles, magi&s;trates, and &s;oldiers. A happy &s;ub|&s;titute, as he imagined, for the parliament; and which, by re&s;toring the ancient forms of the kings of France, would awe and amu&s;e the peo|ple. He did not con&s;ider, that their minds were now full of other objects, and their enthu&s;ia&s;m turned into another channel.</P>
<P>This conduct proved more de&s;tructive to the court than any former folly it's advi&s;ers had committed. Imbecility now characterized every mea&s;ure. The parliament, however, fell into the &s;nare, and forfeited the e&s;teem and confidence of the people by oppo&s;ing &s;ome popular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> par|ticularly one in favour of the prote&s;tants, which they them&s;elves had demanded ten years before, and to which they now objected, only becau&s;e it came from another quarter. Yet the court, re|gardle&s;s of experience, endeavoured to re&s;tore it's credit by per&s;ecution; whil&s;t, making all the cla&s;hing movements that fear could dictate to manife&s;t it's power and overawe the nation, it united all parties, and drew the whole kingdom to one point of action.</P>
<P>The de&s;potic and extravagant &s;teps taken to give efficiency to the <HI>cour pl&eacute;niere,</HI> awakened the &s;en&s;ibility of the mo&s;t torpid; and the vigilance of twenty-five millions of centinels was rou&s;ed, to watch the movements of the court, and follow it's corrupt mini&s;ters, through all the labyrinths of &s;ophi&s;try and tergiver&s;ation, into the very dens of their nefarious machinations. To pre|vent the different parliaments from deliberating, and forming in con&s;equence a plan of conduct together, the edict to &s;anction this packed cabinet
<PB N="40" REF="029916_0052_0FE308D94486EB98">
was to be pre&s;ented to them all on the &s;ame day; and a con&s;iderable force was a&s;&s;embled, to inti|midate the members, who &s;hould dare to prove refractory.

<P>Warmed by the di&s;covery of this &s;urreptitious attempt to cheat them into blind obedience, they bound them&s;elves by an oath, to act in concert; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> regi&s;ter a decree, that had been ob|tain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a medium, which violated the privi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey had u&s;urped of having a &s;hare in the legi&s;lation, by rendering their &s;anction of edicts nece&s;&s;ary to give them force; a privilege that belonge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly to the &s;tates-general.

Yet the &s;agacious chancellor L'H&ocirc;pital, not deceived by their accidental u&s;e|fulne&s;s, guarded the French again&s;t their illegal ambition; for was it not a dangerous courte&s;y of the people, to allow an ari&s;tocracy of lawyers, who bought their places, to be as it were the only repre&s;entatives of the nation? Still their re&s;i&s;t|ance had frequently been an impediment in the way of tyranny, and now provoked a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion,

which led to the mo&s;t important of all que&s;tions &mdash;namely, in who&s;e hands ought the &s;overeignty to re&s;t?&mdash;who ought to levy the impo&s;t, and make laws?&mdash;and the an&s;wer was the univer&s;al demand of a fair repre&s;entation, to meet at &s;tated periods, without depending on the caprice of the executive power.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Necker recalled. His character. Notables convened a &s;econd time. Coalition of the nobility and clergy in defence of their privileges. Provincial a&s;&s;emblies of the People. Political publications in favour of the Tiers-Etat. General reflections on reform,&mdash;on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Europe,&mdash;and on the Revolution in France.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SUCH were the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to exa&s;|perate a people beginning to open their eyes, and now clamorou&s;ly demanding the re&s;titution of their long e&s;tranged rights; when the court having in vain attempted to terrify or deceive them, found it expedient to &s;till the &s;torm by recalling Necker. This man had the confidence of France, which he in &s;ome degree merited for the light he had thrown on the &s;tate of the re|venue, and for the &s;y&s;tem of economy, that he had endeavoured to adopt during his former ad|mini&s;tration: but unfortunately he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s talents or political &s;agacity &s;ufficient to pilot the &s;tate in this perilous &s;ea&s;on. Bred up in a count|ing-hou&s;e, he acquired that knowledge of detail, and attention to little advantages, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary when a man de&s;ires to ama&s;s riches with what is termed a fair character: and, having accumu|lated a very large fortune by unremitting indu&s;try;
<PB N="44" REF="029916_0056_0FE308D0CE76BA70">
or, to borrow the commercial phra&s;e, <HI>attention to the main chance,</HI> his hou&s;e became the re&s;ort of the men of letters of his day.</P>
<P>The foibles of a rich man are always fo&s;tered, &s;ometimes perhaps in&s;en&s;ibly, by his numerous dependents and vi&s;itants, who find his table amu&s;ing or convenient. It is not then &s;urprizing, that, with the abilities of a tolerable financier, he was &s;oon per&s;uaded that he was a great author, and con&s;ummate &s;tate&s;man. Be&s;ides, when the manners of a nation are very depraved, the men who wi&s;h to appear, and even to be, more moral than the multitude, in general become pedanti|cally virtuous; and, continually contra&s;ting their morals with the thoughtle&s;s vices around them, the artificial, narrow character of a &s;ectary is formed; the manners are rendered &s;tiff, and the heart cold. The dupes al&s;o of their flim&s;y virtue, many men are har&s;hly called hypocrites, who are only weak; and popularity often turns the head giddy, that would have &s;oberly fulfilled the common duties of a man in the &s;hade of private life.</P>
<P>Having adopted with a timid hand many of the &s;agacious plans of his model, the clear headed, unaffected Turgot, Necker was con&s;idered by the greater part of the nation as a con&s;ummate politi|cian: neither was it &s;urpri&s;ing, that the people, &s;natched from de&s;pondency, &s;hould have mi&s;taken the extent of his political knowledge, when they had e&s;timated it by that of the greate&s;t &s;tate&s;man, which France, or, perhaps, any other country, ever produced.</P>
<P>Having written on a &s;ubject, that naturally attracted the attention of the public, he had the
<PB N="45" REF="029916_0057_0FE309B0642697C8">
vanity to believe, that he de&s;erved the exaggerated applau&s;e he received, and the reputation of wi&s;e, when he was only &s;hrewd. Not content with the fame he acquired by writing on a &s;ubject, which his turn of mind and profe&s;&s;ion enabled him to comprehend, he wi&s;hed to obtain a higher degree of celebrity, by forming into a large book various metaphy&s;ical &s;hreds of arguments, which he had collected from the conver&s;ation of men, fond of ingenious &s;ubtilities; and the &s;tyle except|ing &s;ome declamatory pa&s;&s;ages, was as inflated and confu&s;ed as the thoughts were far fetched and unconnected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Importance of religious opinions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As it is from this period, that we mu&s;t date the commencement of tho&s;e great events, which, outrunning expectation, have almo&s;t rendered ob|&s;ervation breathle&s;s, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to enter on the ta&s;k with caution; as it ought not to be more the object of the hi&s;torian to fill up the &s;ketch, than to trace the hidden &s;prings and &s;ecret mechani&s;m, which have put in motion a revolu|tion, the mo&s;t important that has ever been re|corded in the annals of man. This was a cri&s;is that demanded boldne&s;s and preci&s;ion; and no man in France, excepting Necker, had the re|putation of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing exten&s;ive political talents; becau&s;e the old &s;y&s;tem of government &s;carcely afforded a field, in which the abilities of men could be unfolded, and their judgment matured by experience. Yet, whil&s;t the kingdom was in the greate&s;t fermentation, he &s;eems to have thought of none but tho&s;e timid half-way mea|&s;ures, which alway prove di&s;a&s;trous in de&s;perate

ca&s;es, when the wound requires to be probed to the quick.</P>
<P>The old government was then only a va&s;t ruin; and whil&s;t its p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lars were trembling on their ba&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le&s;s foundations, the eyes of all France were directed toward their admired mini&s;ter.

In this &s;ituation, li&s;tening to the voice of the nation, becau&s;e he was at a lo&s;s what &s;tep to take to maintain his popularity, he determined to ha&s;ten the convocation of the &s;tates-general: fir&s;t recalling the exiled magi&s;|trates, and re&s;toring the parliaments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the ex|erci&s;e of their functions. His next care was to di&s;&s;ipate all apprehen&s;ion of a famin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; a fear that had been artfully excited by the court agents, in order to have a pretext to form magazines of provi&s;ion for an army, which they had pre|viou&s;ly re&s;olved to a&s;&s;emble in the vicinity of Paris.</P>
<P>Thus far he &s;eems to have acted with &s;ome degree of prudence, at lea&s;t; but, inattentive to the robu&s;t &s;trength which the public opinion had then acquired, he wavered as to the mode of con&s;tituting the &s;tates-general, whil&s;t the par|liament pa&s;&s;ed a decree to prevent their a&s;&s;em|bling in any other manner than they did in 1614. This ob&s;tinate pretention to legi&s;late for the nation was no longer to be tolerated, when they

oppo&s;ed the wi&s;hes of the people: yet, with the common in&s;tinct of corporate bodies, they wrap|ped them&s;elves up in the precedents that proved their winding-&s;heet, provoking univer&s;al con|tempt; for the Herculean force of the whole em|pire was now clearing away every ob&s;tacle to freedom.</P>
<P>At this critical moment, the mini&s;ter, enjoying great popularity, had it in his power, could he have governed the court, to have &s;ugge&s;ted a &s;y&s;tem, which might ultimately have prove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ac|ceptable to all parties; and thus have prevented that dreadful convul&s;ion, which has &s;hook the kingdom from one extremity to the other. In|&s;tead of that, he convened a &s;econd time the <HI>notables,</HI> to take their opinion on a &s;ubject, re&s;pect|ing which the public had al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y decided, not daring him&s;elf to &s;anction its deci&s;ion. The &s;tronge&s;t proof he could give, that his mind was not &s;ufficiently ela&s;tic to expand with the opening views of the people; and that he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he eye of genius, which, quickly di&s;tingui&s;hing what is po&s;&s;ible, enables a &s;tate&s;man to act with firm dignity, re&s;ting on his own centre.</P>
<P>Carried away by the general impul&s;ion, with the incon&s;iderate fervour of men, who&s;e hearts always grow hard as they cool, when they have been warmed by &s;ome &s;udden glow of enthu&s;ia&s;m or &s;ympathy, the <HI>notables</HI> &s;howed, by their &s;ub|&s;equent conduct, that, though they had been led by eloquence to &s;upport &s;ome que&s;tions of a patrioti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tendency, they had not the principles nece&s;&s;ary to impel them to give up local advan|tages, or per&s;onal prerogatives, for the good of the whole community, in which they were only

<P>The <HI>notables</HI> had now two e&s;&s;ential points to &s;ettle; namely, to regulate the election of the deputies, and how they were afterwards to vote. The population and wealth of &s;everal provinces, from commercial advantages and other cau&s;es, had given a new face to the country &s;ince the former election; &s;o much &s;o, that, if the ancient divi&s;ion were adhered to, the repre&s;entation could not fail to be very unequal. Yet if the natural order of population were followed, the grand que&s;tion of voting by orders or by voices &s;eemed to be pre|judged by the great increa&s;e of the members of the <HI>tiers-etat.</HI></P>
<P>The nobles and the clergy immediately rallied round the &s;tandard of privileges, in&s;i&s;ting, that France would be ruined, if their <HI>rights</HI> were touched: and &s;o true were they now to their in|&s;ulated intere&s;t, that all the committees into which the <HI>notables</HI> were divided, excepting that of which <HI>mon&s;ieur</HI> was pre&s;ident, determined again&s;t allow|ing the <HI>tiers-etat</HI> that increa&s;e of power nece&s;&s;ary to enable them to be u&s;eful.

<P>The &s;ame divi&s;ions produced more vi&s;ible effects among&s;t the clergy: for con&s;iderable tu|mults were the con&s;equence of the &s;truggle of the pari&s;h prie&s;ts, the commons of this order, to have th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir due weight in the &s;cale; and their &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed a &s;ure progno&s;tic of the turn things were going to take in the nation.

<P>Indivi&s;ible as had hitherto been the clerical body, the indecent pride of the dignitaries of the church, at this juncture, produced the &s;chi&s;m, which induced the majority of the clergy to &s;ide with the people; whil&s;t only a &s;mall minority of the nobility de&s;erted the common cau&s;e of the party. The pari&s;h-prie&s;ts, in fact, appeared, from the time of their election, a corps in re|&s;erve for the third-e&s;tate; where they &s;ought for the con&s;equence they were denied in their own chamber, finding them&s;elves more nearly allied by intere&s;t, as well as inclination, to this order than to the rich pa&s;tors, who, &s;eparating the &s;heep from the goats, bade them &s;tand aloof, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing le&s;s riches&mdash;the holine&s;s of that body, as of all others. The electing of &s;o many of the

inferior clergy, in &s;pite of the menaces and in|trigues of their numerous &s;uperiors, was a &s;trik|ing proof, that the power of the church was in the wane; and that the people were beginning to feel their own &s;trength. The di&s;turbances at this time &s;eemed the rumbling of the approach|ing tempe&s;t; and orators, formed in the&s;e pro|vincial a&s;&s;emblies, to figure afterwards in national, were encouraged by applau&s;e to per&s;evere.</P>
<P>Having the &s;ame mark in view, an uniformity of &s;entiment breathed throughout the in&s;tructions of the third-e&s;tate; principally levelled at the privileges of the two other orders: for on the&s;e abu&s;es the mo&s;t popular publications had hinged, rivetting conviction in the minds of the &s;uffering people. A celebrated pamphlet, written by the abb&eacute; Sieyes, went through &s;ixty editions; and the duke of Orleans, piqued at the royal family, took great pains to &s;pread abroad opinions, which were far from being congenial with his own; thus, with purblind ambition, labouring to overturn a court, the ruins of which have rebounded on his own head.</P>
<P>But the temper of the nation, &s;ore with &s;uffer|ing, and warmed by the&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, &s;o ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a-head of their judgment, as to lead the electors, with ha&s;ty zeal, to in&s;truct their repre&s;entatives, to demand the immediate &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a ho&s;t of abu&s;es, without guarding again&s;t the con&s;equen|ces.&mdash;Such, unfortunately, is always the con|duct pur&s;ued by exa&s;perated pa&s;&s;ions; for, du|ring the rage to correct abu&s;es, one is, too fre|quently, only exchanged for another.

<P>With one voice, however, the whole nation called for a con&s;titution, to e&s;tabli&s;h equal rights, as the foundation of freedom; and to guard again&s;t the depredations of favourites, whether they attacked per&s;on or property. So that the liberty of the pre&s;s, and the abolition of <HI>lettres de cachet,</HI> were, in general, the articles that followed the po&s;itive injunction of confining the right of taxation to the repre&s;entative body of the nation. The in&s;titution of juries was recommended, and the deputies were reque&s;ted to take into con|&s;ideration, whether the number of capital puni&s;h|ments could not be le&s;&s;ened, or totally aboli&s;h|ed; remarks were made on the evil tendency of lotteries, and on the vexatious impediments thrown in the way of trade, by barriers and mono|polies. In &s;hort, again&s;t the tyranny and inju&s;tice of the court, the nobility, and the clergy, all remon&s;trated; unma&s;king one &s;pecies of oppre&s;|&s;ion, and dil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting on another; yet, among the&s;e numerous animadver&s;ions, prayers and prai&s;es alone were addre&s;&s;ed to the king; and nothing like a glance at republicani&s;m rendered their &s;in|cerity doubtful.</P>
<P>To divert the gathering &s;torm from breaking over their heads, the cabal determined to re&s;t all their hopes on the aid of the foreign troops; which they were collecting from different parts of the kingdom, not ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to tru&s;t to the French &s;ol|diery,

But, it is not alone the virtues of man, tho&s;e changing hues, of which the colour is un|decided, that proclaim his native dignity. No; his vices have the &s;ame &s;tamp of the divinity; and it is nece&s;&s;ary to pervert the under&s;tanding, be|fore the heart can be led a&s;tray. Men, likewi&s;e, indolently adopt the habits of thinking of their day, without weighing them. Thus the&s;e very courtiers, who could coolly contemplate the ma&s;&s;acre, which mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of a&s;&s;embling the foreign troops, becau&s;e it was a continuance of the e&s;tabli&s;hed cour&s;e of things, have &s;ince &s;tarted, probably with real horror, from the contemplation of the butcheries, which their very tenacity produced. Such is the deceit|fulne&s;s of the human heart, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary is it to render the head clear to make the principles of action pure.</P>

And, though the French mania, of adoring their monarch, extended to every part of the kingdom, it only gave hilarity to the cheering gla&s;s at the homely tables of which they were ma&s;ters; or activity to the dance, that was a real bur&s;t of animal &s;pirits.

<P>To furni&s;h a pretext to introduce adroitly a con&s;iderable military force, at the time of the a&s;&s;embling of the &s;tates-general, two or three riots had been exhibited at Paris, in which many of the thoughtle&s;s populace were killed. One in

<P>The di&s;regarded &s;peech of the keeper of the &s;eals was, like the reply u&s;ually made to the king's, in the hou&s;e of commons in England, merely an echo of his maje&s;ty's, recommending moderation in the mea&s;ures adopted to reform the abu&s;es of government, with the nece&s;&s;ary quantum of panegyric on the goodne&s;s of the king.</P>

Lean|ing to the &s;ide of the privileged orders, he a&s;&s;ert|ed, that the mode of deliberating and voting in &s;eparate a&s;&s;emblies was the pillar of the nation &mdash;yet, cautiou&s;ly adding a &s;alvo, to have a pre|text to u&s;e another language &s;hould it be nece&s;|&s;ary, he remarked, that <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> it was better to poll.

Dwelling on the arrangement of the finances, he a&s;&s;ured them, that a public bank|ruptcy might ea&s;ily be avoided; and that even the <HI>deficit,</HI> which had been exaggerated by France, and Europe, was only fifty-&s;ix millions; and would appear of le&s;s con&s;equence, when they recollected, that &s;ince <HI>his</HI> admini&s;tration, the re|venue was augmented twenty-five millions.

<P>Thus has the &s;pirit of ju&s;tice&mdash;it is difficult to keep down indignation when attacking &s;uch &s;ophi&s;ms&mdash;been always outraged by the mock re&s;pect of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; for, without parrying off tergiver&s;ation, it is &s;ufficient to prove, that certain laws are not ju&s;t, becau&s;e no government had a right to make them; and, though they may have received what is termed a legal &s;anction during the times of ignorance, "the duty lies in the breach and not in the ob&s;ervance."

The nobility and clergy not joining the commons, they re&s;olv|ed to renew their meeting the following morn|ing; only as an aggregate of individuals, who had no power to act, not having yet a political character.

<P>The clergy, however, divided in their intere&s;t, proceeded with more caution; and the mo&s;t di&s;|cerning of them, perceiving that their order was becoming obnoxious to the people, who now deified the third e&s;tate, propo&s;ed a committee of conciliation, with a view, as they pretended, to promote a good under&s;tanding between all parties. The king al&s;o, in his turn, when the nobles re|jected the mediation of the clergy, offered a plan of accommodation; a mighty nothing, that the court brought forth.&mdash;But this tub, thrown out to the whale, did not divert the attention of either party from the main object; though the nobles, many of whom were in the &s;ecret of the approach of the army, &s;hould things be carried

Conciliatory mea&s;ures, in fact, were only a &s;olemn farce at this time; though the clergy, rather in&s;idiou&s;ly, to ingratiate them|&s;elves with the people, lamenting the high price of bread, reque&s;ted, that deputies from the three orders &s;hould meet to deliberate how this griev|ance might be le&s;&s;ened. The deputies of the commons, with becoming dignity, tempered with prudence, adhered to their point; and dexter|ou&s;ly parrying off the artful &s;troke levelled at their popularity, they repre&s;ented to the clergy, that this was another powerful motive, to make them entreat all parties to rally round the &s;ame point, to remedy evils which excited equal &s;ym|pathy in their bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>The inactivity occa&s;ioned by the&s;e di&s;putes could not fail to inflame the public mind, e&s;pe|cially as fre&s;h publications were daily affording it fuel. For the liberty of the pre&s;s was now tacitly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the free&s;t &s;entiments utter|ed, with the heat of &s;uperficial knowledge, in defiance of court manife&s;toes. Still, as a proof that the court merely endured, for a &s;ea&s;on, what they could not prevent, the journal of the pro|ceedings of the &s;tates-general was &s;topped, by an expre&s;s order; to evade which it was continued in the form of letters from Mirabeau to his con|&s;tituents.</P>
<P>This prohibition was probably dictated by a de&s;ire of keeping the provinces quiet in the &s;tupor

of ignorance, in which they had &s;o long doz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d; but it was injudicious to awaken attention by rigorous &s;teps, that, quickly abandoned, had the very contrary effect, exciting, in&s;tead of intimi|dating, the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition. In reality, the eyes of all France were at pre&s;ent directed to|wards the commons. The hopes of the nation re&s;ted on their magnanimity; and the future happine&s;s of millions depended upon their per&s;e|verance. It was in this &s;tate of things, that they afforded a convincing proof to the whole world, and to po&s;terity, that vigour and preci&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one are requi&s;ite in the repre&s;entatives of a peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to give dignity to their proceedings, and to &s;ecure them again&s;t the machinations of all the combin|ed powers of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t five weeks having elap&s;ed, and the patience of the nation being quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hau&s;ted by the delay, the commons re&s;olved to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s to the king, written by Mirabeau, ex|planatory of their motives, and then to proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s. But, previou&s;ly, they &s;ent a deputa|tion to the other orders, for the la&s;t time, to invite them once more to repair to the common-hall, that their powers might be verified toge|ther; adding, that in default of their appearance, they &s;hould con&s;titure them&s;elves, and act ac|cordingly. This determination was a deadly blow to the power of the two other chambers, and &s;truck directly at the root of all di&s;tinc|tion.</P>
<P>The nobles, who&s;e inveterate pride and igno|rance had prevented them from joining the th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd-e&s;tate at the fir&s;t a&s;&s;embling of the deputies, now &s;aw with di&s;may, that their power and influence,
<PB N="75" REF="029916_0086_0FE309D4C8DC0930">
like the mu&s;ty rolls of their pedigree, were mouldering into common du&s;t. The clergy, however, more adroit, or rather a few of the the parochial prie&s;ts, by degrees, attended the &s;ummons, and repaired to the hall. There can be little doubt, but that the commons, at the fir&s;t meeting, and for a long time after, would gladly have coale&s;ced with the nobles; by which means the latter would have retained many of their privileges, and pre&s;erved a weight in the nation, nece&s;&s;ary to hinder that preponderance, on the &s;ide of the people, which it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee would be productive of many exce&s;&s;es. This conclu&s;ion continual experience warranted; becau&s;e it generally happens, that men, who are not directed by practical knowledge, in whatever bu&s;ine&s;s they engage, run precipitately from one extreme to the other. And certainly, from the &s;tate of &s;ervility in which the French nation was &s;unk, retaliation was to be expected; or, at lea&s;t, dreaded, from unbridled liberty. Like boys di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from &s;chool, they might wi&s;h to a&s;certain their freedom by acts of mi&s;chief; and by &s;how|ing a total di&s;regard of the arbitrary commands, that kept down their &s;pirits without exerci&s;ing their under&s;tandings. However, the &s;tupid ar|rogance of the nobles &s;tript them, before the time rea&s;on would have determined, of tho&s;e idle di&s;tinctions of opinion, the &s;ymbols of bar|bari&s;m, which were not completely worn out of e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter, &s;till afraid to act independent of the court, blamed this &s;pirited conduct of the commons, as an act of temerity, which t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e king ought not to &s;anction. Yet they, firm and re&s;o|lute,

though fearing that the court, like a dying &s;avage, mortally wounded by his enemy, might, during the agonies of death, aim a de&s;perate &s;troke at them, took the mo&s;t prudent precau|tions, to avoid exa&s;perating the fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing foe. But the&s;e mild re&s;olutions having been mi&s;taken by the infatuated nobles, who confounded the true fortitude of moderation with cowardice, the die was ca&s;t, and the deputies declared them&s;elves a NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.</P>
<P>Enthu&s;ia&s;m fired every heart, and extended it&s;elf like thought from one end of the kingdom to the other. The very novelty of this mea&s;ure was &s;ufficient to animate a people le&s;s volatile than the French; and, perhaps, it is impo&s;&s;ible to form a ju&s;t conception of the tran&s;ports which this deci&s;ion excited in every corner of the empire. Europe al&s;o heard with a&s;toni&s;hment what re&s;ounding through France excited the mo&s;t lively emotions; and po&s;terity mu&s;t read with wonder the recital of the follies and atro|cities committed by the court and nobles at that important cri&s;is.</P>
<P>The Social Contract of Rou&s;&s;eau, and his ad|mirable work on the origin of the inequalities among&s;t mankind, had been in the hands of all France, and admired by many, who could not enter into the depth of the rea&s;oning. In &s;hort, they were learned by heart, by tho&s;e who&s;e heads could not comprehend the chain of argument, though they were &s;ufficiently clear to &s;eize the prominent ideas, and act up to their conviction. Perhaps, the great advantage of eloquence is, that, impre&s;&s;ing the re&s;ults of thinking on minds alive only to emotion, it gives wings to the &s;low

foot of rea&s;on, and fire to the cold labours of inve&s;tigation: yet it is ob&s;ervable, that, in pro|portion as the under&s;tanding is cultivated, the mind grows attached to the exerci&s;e of inve&s;tiga|tion, and the combination of ab&s;tract ideas. The nobles of France had al&s;o read the&s;e writings for amu&s;ement; but they left not on their minds traces of conviction &s;ufficiently &s;trong to over|come tho&s;e prejudices &s;elf-intere&s;t rendered &s;o dear, that they ea&s;ily per&s;uaded them&s;elves of their rea&s;onablene&s;s. The nobility and clergy, with all their dependents under the influence of the &s;ame &s;entiments, formed a con&s;iderable pro|portion of the nation, on the re&s;t of which they looked down with contempt, con&s;idering them as merely the gra&s;s of the land, nece&s;&s;ary to clothe nature; yet only fit to be trodden under foot. But the&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed people were beginning to feel their real con&s;equence, and repeated with empha&s;is the happy compari&s;on of the Abb&eacute; Si&eacute;yes,
<Q>that the nobility are like vegetable tu|mours, which cannot exi&s;t without the &s;ap of the plants they exhau&s;t.</Q>
Neverthele&s;s, in treating with the nobles, the angles of pride, which time alone could have &s;moothed &s;ilently away, were, perhaps, too rudely knocked off, for the folly of di&s;tinctions was rapidly wearing it&s;elf out, and would probably have melted gradually before the rational opinions that were con|tinually gaining ground, fructifying the &s;oil as they di&s;&s;olved; in&s;tead of which it was drifted by a hurricane, to &s;pread de&s;truction around as it fell.</P>
<P>Many of the officers, who had &s;erved in Ame|rica during the late war, had beheld the inha|bitants

Convince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their inutility as nobles, the&s;e, when fired with the love of free|dom, &s;econded the views of the commons with heart and voice. But the &s;ycophants of the court, and the greater part of the nobility, who were gro&s;sly ignorant of every thing that was not com|pri&s;ed in the art of living in a continual round of plea&s;ure, in&s;en&s;ible of the precipice on which they were &s;tanding, would not, at fir&s;t, recede a &s;ingle &s;tep to &s;ave them&s;elves; and this ob&s;tinacy was the chief cau&s;e that led to the entire new organization of the con&s;titution, framed by the national a&s;&s;embly. The French in reality were arrived, through the vices of their government, at that degree of fal&s;e refinement, which makes every man, in his own eyes, the centre of the world; and when this gro&s;s &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, this com|plete depravity, prevails in a nation, an ab&s;olute change mu&s;t take place; becau&s;e the members of it have lo&s;t the cement of humanity, which kept them together. All other vices are, properly &s;peaking, &s;uperfluous &s;trength, powers running to wa&s;te; but this morbid &s;pot &s;hows, that there is death in the heart. Whatever, indeed, may be the wi&s;dom or folly of a mixed government of king, lords, and commons, is of no con&s;equence in the pre&s;ent hi&s;tory; becau&s;e it appears &s;uf|ficiently ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous, that the ari&s;tocracy of France de&s;troyed it&s;elf, through the ignorant arrogance of it's members; who, bewildered in a thick fog

<P>It al&s;o de&s;erves to be noted, that the regenera|tion of the French government, at this cri&s;is, de|pended on the fortitude of the national a&s;&s;embly at the out&s;et of the conte&s;t; for, if the court party had prevailed, the commons would have re&s;ted in their u&s;ual &s;tate of in&s;ignificancy, and their whole proceedings proved only a &s;olemn farce.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE third-e&s;tate, having con&s;tituted them|&s;elves a national a&s;&s;embly, now proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s, with calm prudence, taking into con|&s;ideration the urgent nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate. Clo&s;ely al&s;o attending to their in&s;tructions, they fir&s;t pronounced, that all taxes not enacted by the con&s;ent of the repre&s;entatives of the people
<PB N="81" REF="029916_0092_0FE309D8FACBAE78">
were illegal; and afterwards gave a temporary &s;anction to the pre&s;ent levies, to avoid di&s;&s;olving one government before they had framed another. They then turned their attention to the object next in importance, and declared, that, as &s;oon as, in concert with his maje&s;ty, they &s;hould be able to fix the principles of national regeneration, they would employ them&s;elves to examine and liquidate the national debt; mean time the cre|ditors of the &s;tate were declared to be under the &s;afe-guard of the honour of the French nation. The&s;e decrees concluded with a re&s;olve, that the a&s;&s;embly, now become active, &s;hould dedicate it's fir&s;t moments to enquire into the cau&s;e of the &s;carcity that afflicted the kingdom; and to &s;earch for a remedy the mo&s;t prompt and effectual.</P>
<P>The nobles, bi&s;hops, and, in fact, the whole court, now &s;eriou&s;ly began to rally all their forces; convinced that it was become nece&s;&s;ary, to op|po&s;e their united &s;trength again&s;t the commons, to prevent their carrying every thing before them.</P>
<P>The chamber of the clergy had been engaged for &s;everal days, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the que&s;tion, where they &s;hould verify their powers. A number of them, during this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, appear to have ad|vanced, feeling their way; for when they now came to divide, the majority decided to join the national a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Alarmed by the pro&s;pect of this junction, one of the members of the chamber, which almo&s;t arrogated to it&s;elf the prerogative of legi&s;lation, that of the nobles, propo&s;ed an addre&s;s to the king, be&s;eeching him to di&s;&s;ove the &s;tates-general;
<PB N="82" REF="029916_0093_0FE308A8A1550520">
whil&s;t the cau&s;e of the people was there vigor|ou&s;ly &s;upported by a minority, feeble as to num|bers, but powerful in argument, animated by the popularity, which their bold declaration could not fail to produce during the reign of enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>This was a moment pregnant with great events. The court &s;till tru&s;ted to &s;ubterfuge, and, hold|ing the repre&s;entatives of the people in &s;uperlative contempt, affected in &s;ome degree to yield to the prayer of the nation; though &s;ignifying, that the king was the only fountain of ju&s;tice, and that he would grant any thing which his faithful &s;ubjects could rea&s;onably demand. A trick as palpable as the de&s;ign was flagrant; for at the in&s;tant they were pretending to &s;ee &s;ome rea&s;on in their re|qui&s;itions, they were guarding again&s;t their ob|taining the only thing that could &s;ecure their rights, an equal repre&s;entation; holding for this purpo&s;e mi&s;chievous councils, compo&s;ed of cha|racters mo&s;t obnoxious in the eyes of the people. In the&s;e meetings it was re&s;olved, to amu&s;e the commons, until the army could be a&s;&s;embled; and then, in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy, they would draw on them&s;elves the con&s;equence. Accordingly the 20th of June, the day on which the majority of the clergy was to join the commons, the herald proclaimed a <HI>&s;&eacute;ance royale</HI>; and a detachment of guards &s;urrounded the hall of the national a&s;&s;embly, to take care (&s;uch was the &s;hallow pre|text) that it &s;hould be properly prepared for the reception of the king. The deputies came to the door at the u&s;ual hour; but only the pre&s;ident (Baillie) and the &s;ecretaries were permitted to enter to take away their papers: and they &s;aw,

<P>A&s;&s;embled at the Tennis-court, they encouraged each other; and one mind actuated the whole body, in the pre&s;ence of an applauding crowd, they joined hands &s;olemnly, and took God to witne&s;s, that they would not &s;eparate, till a con|&s;titution &s;hould be completed.

The ab&s;ent deputies were &s;ent for; and one, who happened to be &s;ick, had him&s;elf carried to unite his feeble voice with the general cry. The very &s;oldiers al&s;o, di&s;obeying their officers, came to be willing centinels at the entrance of the &s;anc|tuary of liberty, eagerly imbibing the &s;entiments, which they afterwards &s;pread through their garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>This indignity offered to the third e&s;tate could not fail to excite new &s;en&s;ations of di&s;gu&s;t at Paris; and give a fre&s;h &s;pring to the animation of the people at large. Yet, this &s;pirited behaviour of of the commons excited only &s;upercilious con|tempt at court. For the gay circles there were &s;o far &s;unk in fa&s;tidious delicacy, and &s;queami&s;h re&s;pect for poli&s;hed manners, that they could not even di&s;cover magnanimity in the conduct of a pea&s;ant, or a &s;hopkeeper; much le&s;s grandeur in an a&s;&s;embly regardle&s;s of ceremonials. And not to be deficient them&s;elves in the&s;e re&s;pects, the <HI>&s;&eacute;ance royale</HI> was put off another day, in order that the galleries, which had been erected for the accommodation of &s;pectators by the national a&s;&s;embly, might be removed.</P>
<P>This was another injudicious &s;tep on the part of the cabinet; becau&s;e it afforded time for the clergy to unite with the commons, who were in &s;earch of a place &s;ufficiently capacious to contain &s;uch a body.

<P>The following day, the <HI>&s;&eacute;ance royale</HI> really took place, with all the exterior &s;plendor u&s;ually ex|hibited at the&s;e &s;hows; which hitherto could &s;carcely be termed empty, becau&s;e they produced the de&s;ired effect. But the public, having their attention tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to other things, now viewed with contempt, what had formerly in&s;pired almo&s;t idolatrous re&s;pect. The deputies of the third-e&s;tate were again ordered to enter by a &s;eparate door, and even left a con&s;iderable time &s;tanding expo&s;ed to a heavy &s;hower. The people, who were totally excluded, formed them&s;elves into groups, making indignant comments on the re|peated affronts offered to their repre&s;entatives, who&s;e minds likewi&s;e recoiled at the idle attempt to impre&s;s them with an opinion of their in|&s;ignificancy; when the very pains taken to do it proclaimed their growing importance in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The object of the king's &s;peech, on this occa|&s;ion, was to annul the whole proceedings of the national a&s;&s;embly, and to hold out certain bene|fits, as lures to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which the king meant to grant to the people; as if, ob&s;erves Mirabeau,

A declaration of his &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure was then read, in which, making an in&s;idious attempt to withdraw from the a&s;&s;embly the confidence of the public, he declared, that, if they abandoned him, he would provide for the happine&s;s of his people, without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance,

The tenor of all the re&s;t of the articles was the &s;ame: commencing with a plan of re|form, and concluding with the <HI>ifs</HI> and <HI>buts,</HI> that were to render it void.&mdash;Then winding round to the grand object of the meeting, the king terminated his di&s;cour&s;e, with &s;aying, forgetful that this was not the period to imagine him&s;elf

<P>The majority of the nobles, and the minority of the clergy, obeyed this preremptory order, and ob&s;eq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ly followed the king, like the train|ed hor&s;es of his court.

However, to avoid all equivocation or delay, I declare to you, that if you are charged to make us go from hence, you &s;hould demand orders to employ force; for only the bayonet can oblige us to quit our places.</Q>
It is difficult to conceive the ardour in&s;pired by this prompt eloquence. It's fire flew from brea&s;t to brea&s;t, whil&s;t a whi&s;per ran round, that what
<PB N="88" REF="029916_0099_0FE30A76C7A40E00">
Mirabeau had ju&s;t uttered, gave a fini&s;hing &s;troke to the revolution.</P>
<P>A warm debate en&s;ued; and the a&s;&s;embly de|claring their adherence to their former decrees, the abb&eacute; Si&eacute;yes &s;aid, in his dry, cogent manner:
<Q>gentlemen, you are to day what you were ye&s;terday.</Q>
A motion was then made, by Mi|rabean, who &s;ugge&s;ted, as a prudent precaution again&s;t the mea&s;ures of a de&s;peratec abal, that the per&s;on of each deputy &s;hould be pronounced in|violable; and, after a &s;light di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, it was carried unanimou&s;ly.</P>
<P>From this moment we may con&s;ider the nation and court at open war. The court had at their command the whole military force of the empire, amounting, at lea&s;t, to 200,000 men. The peo|ple, on the contrary, had only their bare arms, invigorated, it is true, by the new-born love of freedom, to oppo&s;e to the various weapons of tyranny. But the army, partaking of the com|mon mi&s;ery, were not deaf to the complaints or arguments of their fellow citizens: and they were particularly led to con&s;ider them with compla|cency, becau&s;e a ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion, or prudent fore&s;ight, had induced many of the popular a&s;&s;em|blies, to in&s;ert a cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e in their in&s;tructions, re|commending, that the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the &s;oldiers &s;hould be augmented. Thus recognized as fellow citi|zens, this cla&s;s of men, whom it had been the policy of the de&s;pots of Europe to keep at a di&s;|tance from the other inhabitants, making them a di&s;tinct cla&s;s, to oppre&s;s and corrupt the re&s;t, began to feel an intere&s;t in the common cau&s;e. But the court, who either could not, or would
<PB N="89" REF="029916_0100_0FE30A4353AFB028">
not, combine the&s;e important facts, ra&s;hly pre|cipitated them&s;elves into the very quick&s;and, into which they were vainly endeavouring to drive the commons.</P>
<P>As Necker had not attended in his place, at the <HI>&s;&eacute;ance royale,</HI> it gave colour to the rumour, which had for &s;ome time prevailed, that he propo&s;ed to retire from the mini&s;try: &s;o that, when the king returned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was followed by an immen&s;e crowd, who could not conceal their di&s;content. Under the influence al&s;o of the &s;ame fear, a number of the deputies ha&s;tened to Necker, to intreat him not to re&s;ign. And the con&s;ternation increa&s;ing, the queen, who has ever been the fir&s;t to de&s;ert her own plans, when there appeared a &s;hadow of per&s;onal danger, &s;ent for him; and, the better to cover the project of the cabinet, prevailed on him not to quit his po&s;t. The object of the cabinet he either had not the penetration to di&s;|cover; or he had not &s;ufficient magnanimity to re&s;ign a place, that gratified equally his pride and his avarice. This mea&s;ure tended to tran|quillize the minds of the people, though it was undermining their cau&s;e: for tru&s;ting to the in|tegrity of this mini&s;ter, who promi&s;ed,
<Q>to live or die with them,</Q>
they did not perceive, that he wanted the energy of &s;oul nece&s;&s;ary to enable him to act up to the principles he profe&s;&s;ed. However, the cau&s;e of liberty, as circum&s;tances have proved, did not depend on the talents of one or two men.&mdash;It was the fiat of the nation; and the machinations of the tyrants of Europe have not ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been able to overturn it; though fal&s;e patiots have led them, in their ardour for

reform, to the commi&s;&s;ion of actions the mo&s;t cruel and unju&s;t. Every thing was effected by natural cau&s;es; and we &s;hall find, if we take a cur&s;ory view of the progre&s;s of knowledge, that it's advance towards &s;imple principles is invariably in a ratio, which mu&s;t &s;peedily change the tangled &s;y&s;tem of European politics.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;&eacute;ance royale</HI> produced &s;o little effect, that the a&s;&s;embly, as if their &s;ittings had never been interrupted, met the next day at the old hall; and the day after, the minority of the nobles, which con&s;i&s;ted of forty-&s;even members, came to incorporate them&s;elves with the commons. All of the&s;e, and particularly the duke of Orleans, who led them, acquired by this popular conduct, the love and confidence of the nation. How far they merited it, deceiving the public, or them|&s;elves, their future conduct will be&s;t explain.</P>
<P>The intere&s;ting events, in fact, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch almo&s;t daily occurred, at the commencement of the re|volution, fired the fancies of men of different de&s;criptions; till, forgetting every &s;elfi&s;h con|&s;ideration, the rich and poor &s;aw through the &s;ame focus. But, when the former had time to cool, and felt more forcibly than the latter the inconveniences of anarchy, they returned with fre&s;h vigour to their old ground; embracing with redoubled ardour, the prejudices which pa&s;&s;ion, not conviction, had cha&s;ed from the field, during the heat of action. This was a &s;trong reinforce|ment for the &s;taunch ari&s;tocrats; becau&s;e the&s;e were mo&s;tly good, but &s;hort-&s;ighted people, who really wi&s;hed, that ju&s;tice might be e&s;tabli&s;hed, as the foundation of the new government, though

they flinched when their pre&s;ent ea&s;e was di&s;turb|ed; and it was nece&s;&s;ary to give more than good wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>This minority of nobles mu&s;t certainly be allow|ed to have acted more prudently than their peers; and &s;everal of them, the mo&s;t re&s;pectable men of that cla&s;s, both in talents and morals, were pro|bably actuated by half comprehended principles. The great body of the nobles, neverthele&s;s, and the minority of the clergy, continued to meet in different chambers, where their idle deliberations marked their decayed influence. For, &s;hrinking into nothing, their pre&s;ent &s;truggles to regain their power were as fruitle&s;s, as their former efforts had been pre&s;umptuous. Yet the jealou|&s;ies and contumely of the nobility continued to agitate the commons; who, animated by a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, and feeling that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the confidence of the public, determined to proceed with the objects of their meeting, without the concurrence of the fir&s;t order; proving to them, when it was too late to pre&s;erve their factitious di&s;tinctions, that their power and authority were at an end. In vain were they told, that they were acting contrary to their true intere&s;t, and ri&s;king the &s;alvation of their privileges. In vain did one of the mo&s;t moderate of the deputies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Count Lally Tolendal.</NOTE> remon&s;trate with them, on what, mo&s;t probably, would be the con&s;e|quence of their ob&s;tinacy. No argument could move them; and, blind to the danger with which they were threatened, they per&s;i&s;ted to attend their councils, without any determinate rule of
<PB N="92" REF="029916_0103_0FE30A03809FE598">
action. It is true, the duke of Luxembourgh declared, in a private committee held by the king, on the <GAP DESC="blank"> of June, that
<Q>the divi&s;ion of the orders would controul the exorbitant claims of the people, and pre&s;erve tho&s;e of the monarch; united,</Q>
added he,
<Q>they know no ma&s;ter, divid|ed, they are your &s;ubjects;</Q>
and he concluded, with emphatically &s;aying, that
<Q>it would &s;ave the independence of the crown, and &s;tamp with nullity the proceedings of the national a&s;&s;em|bly.</Q>
The&s;e were manly, though not patriotic &s;entiments; and if the court had rallied round them, and defended them to the la&s;t extremity, they would at any rate have prevented their di&s;|grace, by avoiding the crooked path of treachery. But abandoning all dignity of conduct, they tru&s;ted to the art of manoeuvring, which defeat|ed by the people, they were left entirely at their mercy.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the improvement of &s;ociety, &s;ince the de&s;truction of the Roman empire, En|gland &s;eems to have led the way, rendering certain ob&s;tinate prejudices almo&s;t null, by a gradual change of opinion.

In Italy and France, for ex|ample where the mind dared to exerci&s;e it&s;elf only to form the ta&s;te, the nobility were, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, a ca&s;t keeping aloof from the people; whil&s;t in England they inter|mingled with the commerical men, who&s;e equal

or &s;uperior fortunes made the nobles overlook their inequality of birth: thus giving the fir&s;t blow to the ignorant pride that retarded the for|mation of ju&s;t opinions re&s;pecting true dignity of character. This monied intere&s;t, from which political improvement fir&s;t emanates, was not yet formed in France; and the ridiculous pride of her nobles, which led them to believe, that the purity of their families would be &s;ullied, if they agreed to act in the &s;ame &s;phere with the people, was a prevailing motive, that prevented their junction with the commons. But the more licentious part of the clergy, who followed with a truer &s;cent their own intere&s;t, thought it expe|dient to e&s;pou&s;e, in time, the cau&s;e of the power from whence their influence derived it's greate&s;t force; and from which alone they could hope for &s;upport. This &s;chi&s;m proved, as it promi&s;ed, dangerous to the views of the court.</P>
<P>The de&s;ertion of the clergy rendered the nobility outrageous, and ha&s;tened the cri&s;is when the important conte&s;t was to be brought to an i&s;&s;ue.&mdash;Then it was that the king perceived how contemptible his undecided conduct had been, and exclaiming, it is &s;aid, confidently,
<Q>that he remained ALONE in the mid&s;t of the nation, oc|cupied with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of concord.</Q>
Vain words! and this affectation was par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">larly reprehen&s;ible, becau&s;e he had already g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or|ders for the a&s;&s;embling of the foreign t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the object of which was to e&s;tabli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with the point of the bayonet.</P>
<P>This total want of character cau&s;ed him to be flattered by all parties, and tru&s;ted by none. In|&s;ignificancy had di&s;tingui&s;hed his manners in his

own court. Actions without energy, and pro|fe&s;&s;ions without &s;incerity, exhibiting a conduct de&s;titute of &s;teadine&s;s, made the cabinet concert all their mea&s;ures regardle&s;s of his opinion, leaving to the queen the ta&s;k of per&s;uading him to adopt them. The evil did not re&s;t even here; for the different parties following &s;eparate views, the flexibility of his temper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed him to &s;anction things the mo&s;t at variance, and mo&s;t dangerous to his future honour and &s;afety.

Pe|riods of revolution drawing into action the wor&s;t as well as the be&s;t of men; and as audacity, in general, triumphs over mode&s;t merit, when the political horizon is ruffled by tempe&s;t; it amount|ed to a moral certainty, that the line of con|duct pur&s;ued by the king would lead to his di&s;|grace and ruin.</P>
<P>Seeing, however, that the people were unani|mous in their approbation of the conduct of their repre&s;entatives, and watchful to di&s;cover the de|&s;igns of their enemies; it could not but occur to the cabinet, that the only way to lull attention to &s;leep, was to affect to &s;ubmit to nece&s;&s;ity. Be|&s;ides, fearing, if they continued to re&s;ort to their different chambers, that their plot would take wind before all the agents were a&s;&s;embled, a fre&s;h in&s;tance of di&s;&s;imulation evinced, that their de|pravity equalled their &s;tupidity. For the king was now prevailed on to write to the pre&s;idents of the nobility, and the minority of the clergy, reque&s;ting them, to repre&s;ent to tho&s;e two orders

<P>The clergy immediately acquie&s;ced; but the nobility continued to oppo&s;e a junction &s;o humi|liating, till the court invented a pretext of ho|nour to &s;ave the credit of their mock dignity, by declaring that the life of the king would be in imminent danger, &s;hould the nobles continue to re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of the nation. Pretending to believe this report, for the &s;ecret of the cabinet was buzzed among&s;t them, and appearing to wi&s;h to bury all rivalry in royalty, they attended at the common hall, the 27th. Yet even there, the fir&s;t &s;tep they took was to enter a prote&s;t, in order to guard again&s;t this conce&s;&s;ion being made a precedent.</P>
<P>A general joy &s;ucceeded the terror which had been engendered in the minds of the people by their contumelious perver&s;ne&s;s; and the Pari|&s;ians, cheri&s;hing the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, reckoned, that an unity of exertions would &s;ecure to them a redre&s;s of grievances.</P>
<P>It is perhaps unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell, for a mo|ment, on the in&s;en&s;ibility of the court, and the credulity of the people; as they &s;eem the only clues, that will lead us to a preci&s;e di&s;crimination of the cau&s;es, which completely annihilated all confidence in the mini&s;ters, who have &s;ucceeded the directors of tho&s;e infamous mea&s;ures, that &s;wept away the whole party; mea&s;ures which involved thou&s;ands of innocent people in the &s;ame ruin, and have produced a clamour again&s;t the proceedings of the nation, that has ob&s;cured the glory of her labours.

Un|dubtedly I do not know every pretext, every artifice of the enemies of reformation, &s;ince I cannot divine with what plau&s;ible rea&s;on they have coloured the pretended want of troops, at a moment, when not only their inutility, but their danger, &s;trikes every mind.</Q></P>
<P><Q>With what eye will the people, hara&s;&s;ed by &s;o many calamities, &s;ee this &s;warm of idle &s;oldiers come to di&s;pute with them their mor&s;el of bread?

He concluded with moving an addre&s;s to the king, repre&s;enting, that the people were extremely alarmed by the a&s;&s;embling

of &s;uch a number of troops, and the preparations made to form camps during this &s;ea&s;on of &s;carcity; and to remon&s;trate re&s;pecting the conduct of tho&s;e, who &s;ought to de&s;troy the confidence that ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the king and the repre|&s;entatives of the people&mdash;a confidence, which alone can enable them to fulfil their functions, and e&s;tabli&s;h the reform expected from their zeal by a &s;uffering nation.</P>
<P>This &s;peech produced the de&s;ired effect; and the motion being carried, Mirabeau was reque&s;ted to prepare an addre&s;s for their con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The purport of the addre&s;s was an abridgment of the above &s;peech; re&s;pectful; nay, even affec|tionate; but &s;pirited and noble.</P>
<P>Yet this remon&s;trance, &s;o well calculated to pre&s;erve the dignity of the monarch, and appea&s;e the agitation of the public, produced no other effect than a &s;upercilious an&s;wer, that only tended to increa&s;e the want of confidence, to which di&s;gu&s;t gave a new edge. For, in&s;tead of attend|ing to the prayer of the nation, the king a&s;&s;erted, that the tumultuous and &s;candalous &s;cenes, which had pa&s;&s;ed at Paris, and at Ver&s;ailles, under his own eyes, and tho&s;e of the national a&s;&s;embly, were &s;ufficient to induce him, one of who&s;e prin|cipal duties it was to watch over the public &s;afety, to &s;tation troops round Paris.&mdash;Still, he declared, that, far from intending to interrup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their freedom of debate, he only wi&s;hed to pre|&s;erve them even from all apprehen&s;ion of tumult and violence.

This an&s;wer &s;ignified nothing; or, rather, it formally announced, that the king would not &s;end away the troops. Obvious as was the mean|ing, and contemptible as was the di&s;&s;imulation, yet, as it came from the &s;overeign, the fountain of fortune and honours, &s;ome of the &s;upple hands of the deputies applauded.&mdash;But, Mirabeau was not to be cajoled by &s;uch &s;hallow fallacy.

&s;aid he, impatiently,
<Q>the goodne&s;s of the king's heart is &s;o well known, that we might tranquilly confide in his virtue, did he always act from him&s;elf.&mdash;But, the a&s;&s;urances of the king are no guarantee for the conduct of his mini&s;ters, who have not cea&s;ed to mi&s;lead his good di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;And have we yet to learn, that the habitual confidence of the French in their king is le&s;s a virtue than a vice, if it ex|tended to all parts of the admini&s;tration?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Who among&s;t us is ignorant, in fact, that it is our blind, giddy incon&s;ideration, which has led us from century to century, from fault to fault, to the cri&s;is that now afflicts us, and which ought at la&s;t to open our eyes, if we have not re&s;olved to be head-&s;trong children and &s;laves till the end of time?</Q></P>
<P><Q>The reply of the king is a pointed refu&s;al. The mini&s;try would have it regarded only as a &s;imple form of a&s;&s;urance and goodne&s;s; and they have affected to think, that we have made our demand, without attaching much intere&s;t to it's &s;ucce&s;s, and only to appear to have made it. It is nece&s;&s;ary to undeceive the mini&s;try.&mdash;Cer|tainly,
<PB N="112" REF="029916_0123_0FE30A8F6E467F20">
my opinion is, not to fail in the confi|dence and re&s;pect which we owe to the virtues of the king; but I likewi&s;e advi&s;e, that we be no more incon&s;i&s;tent, timid, and wavering in our mea&s;ures.&mdash;Certainly, there is no need to deliberate on the removal propo&s;ed; for, in &s;hort, notwith&s;tanding the king's an&s;wer, we will not go to Noyon, nor to Soi&s;&s;ons.&mdash;We have not demanded this permi&s;&s;ion; nor will we, becau&s;e it is &s;carcely probable, that we &s;hould ever de&s;ire to place our&s;elves between two or three bodies of troops; tho&s;e which in|ve&s;t Paris, and tho&s;e which might fall upon us from Flanders and Alface. We have demanded the removal of the troops&mdash;that was the object of our addre&s;s!&mdash;We have not a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to &s;lee before them; but only that they &s;hould be &s;ent from the capital. And it is not for our&s;elves, that we have made this demand; for they know very well, that it was &s;ugge&s;ted by a concern for the general intere&s;t, not by any &s;entiment of fear. At this moment, the pre&s;ence of the troops di&s;turbs the public order, and may produce the mo&s;t melancholy events.&mdash; Our removal, far from preventing, would, on the contrary, only aggravate the evil. It is nece&s;&s;ary, then, to re&s;tore peace, in &s;pite of the friends of di&s;order; it is nece&s;&s;ary, to be con&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves; and to be &s;o, we have only to adhere to one line of conduct, which is to in&s;i&s;t, without relaxing, that the troops be &s;ent away, as the only &s;ure way to obtain it.</Q></P>

<P>But things were now drawing rapidly to a cri&s;is; for this very day Necker, who had been retained in place, only to hoodwink the people, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with an injunction not to mention his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; and to leave the kingdom in twenty-four hours.

<P>The next day, the appointment of the new mini&s;try, men particularly obnoxious to the pub|lic, made it known to the people; who viewed with melancholy horror the awful horizon, where had long been gathering the &s;torm now ready to bur&s;t on their devoted heads.

<P>It had been propo&s;ed on the 10th, at the <HI>H&ocirc;tel-de-Ville,</HI> as a regulation of the <HI>Garde-Bourgeoi&s;e,</HI> that twelve hundred men &s;hould be rai&s;ed at a time, to be relieved every week; and the capital having been divided, at the election, into &s;ixty di&s;tricts, only twenty would be called out of each. And it was further re&s;olved, that the di&s;tricts &s;hould re&s;t embodied until the entire evacuation of the troops, excepting tho&s;e who formed the common complement of the guards. The following day it was decreed; an addre&s;s was voted to the national a&s;&s;embly, to reque&s;t their mediation with the king, to &s;anction im|mediately the city militia; and the &s;ittings of the committee were adjourned till Monday, the 13th.

<P>At eight o'clock, the patrol guard was re|lieved, at the <HI>H&ocirc;tel-de-Ville,</HI> and the multitude pre&s;&s;ed on the &s;oldiers to di&s;arm them; redoubling the cry for arms at the moment; and even threat|ened to &s;et fire to the hall. But, &s;till ob&s;erving &s;ome re&s;pect for &s;ubordination, they demanded, a little imperiou&s;ly, it is true, an order, in virtue of which, the citizens might arm them|&s;elves to repul&s;e the danger that menaced the

<P>One of the crowd &s;aid, that, no &s;ooner had the news of the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Necker reached Paris, than the people ha&s;tened to a &s;culptor's, and, &s;eizing the bu&s;ts of that mini&s;ter, and of the duke of Orleans, they were now actually carrying them through the &s;treets:&mdash;Another informed them, that the multitude had ru&s;hed into the different theatres, at the hour of opening them, and required, that they &s;hould be in&s;tantly &s;hut;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is an event much more important at Paris, than it would be in London.</NOTE> and that in con&s;equence all the &s;pectators had been &s;ent away:&mdash;A third anounced four cannons, placed at the entrance of the <HI>Champs Ely&s;&eacute;es,</HI> with their cannoneers ready to light their matches, which were to begin the combat; and that the&s;e four cannons were &s;upported by a regiment of cavalry, which, advancing under the command of the prince de Lambe&s;c to the place of Louis XV. was &s;tationed by the bridge that leads to the Thuilleries. He added al&s;o, that a <HI>cavalier</HI> of this regiment, pa&s;&s;ing by a &s;oldier of the French guards, had fired his pi&s;tol at him; and, that the prince de Lambe&s;c him&s;elf had galloped into the garden, &s;abre in hand, followed by a detachment, who put to flight the old men, women, and children, that were peaceably taking their cu&s;tomary walk; nay, that he had actually killed, with his own hand, an old man, who was e&s;caping from the tumult. The reporter, it is true, forgot to notice, that the populace
<PB N="116" REF="029916_0127_0FE30A9396C9DCC0">
had begun to pelt the prince with the &s;tones that were lying ready, near the buildings which were not fini&s;hed.

<P>Still all their thoughts were turned on defen|&s;ive mea&s;ures.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>EARLY in the morning of the 13th, the electors ha&s;tened to the centre of the general alarm, the <HI>H&ocirc;tel-de-ville,</HI> and, urged by the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the moment, pa&s;&s;ed the decrees, under deliberation, for the immediate embodying the <HI>garde-bourgeoi&s;e,</HI> without waiting for the reque&s;ted &s;anction of the national a&s;&s;embly. The greater number then withdrew, to convoke their di&s;tricts; whil&s;t the few that remained endeavoured to calm the tumult that was every moment augmenting, by informing the people of this decree; repre|&s;enting at the &s;ame time, to the citizens, the cogent motives which &s;hould induce them to &s;eparate, and each repair to his own di&s;trict to be enrolled. But the crowd again called for arms, pretending, that there was a great number concealed in an ar&s;enal, which nobody could point out. To quiet the&s;e clamours for a moment, the people
<PB N="122" REF="029916_0133_0FE309F99F46C660">
were referred to the <HI>pr&eacute;vot des marchands</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mayor.</NOTE>. He accordingly came and reque&s;ted, that the multi|tude would confirm his nomination to the func|tion, which his maje&s;ty had confided to him. A general acclamation was the &s;ignal of their con|&s;ent; and the a&s;&s;embled electors immediately turned their attention to the &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s before them.</P>
<P>They then e&s;tabli&s;hed a <HI>permanent committee,</HI> to keep up a con&s;tant intercour&s;e with the differ|ent di&s;tricts, to which the citizens were again exhorted in&s;tantly to return, with all the arms they had collected; that tho&s;e arms might be properly di&s;tributed among the Pari&s;ian militia. But it was impo&s;&s;ible to pur&s;ue the&s;e important deliberations, with any degree of order, for a fre&s;h multitude was continually ru&s;hing forward, to report fre&s;h intelligence; often fal&s;e or exag|gerated, and always alarming. The barriers, they were told, were on fire; a religious hou&s;e had been pillaged; and a ho&s;tile force was on the road, in full march, to fall upon the citizens. An immen&s;e number of coaches, waggons, and other carriages were actually brought to the door of the hotel; and the demands of the con|cour&s;e, who had been &s;topped going out of Paris, mingling with the cries of the multitude, eager to be led towards the troops, who&s;e approach had been announced, were only drowned by the more lively in&s;tances of the deputies of the &s;ixty di&s;tricts, demanding arms and ammunition, to render them active.

<Q>that, &s;hould they peri&s;h, their country &s;till &s;urviving would re|cover it's vigour; and that their plans for the good of the public again warming the hearts of Frenchmen, a brave, and generous people would erect on their tomb, as an im|mortal trophy, a con&s;titution &s;olid as rea&s;on, and durable as time:&mdash;whil&s;t their martyr|dom would &s;erve as an example, to prove

after they were informed, that the order was obeyed.</P>
<P>To calm the people, the&s;e very men de&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e of the <HI>H&ocirc;tel-de-Ville,</HI> to proclaim the a&s;&s;urances they had received of the amicable intentions of the governor; but, whil&s;t the trumpet was &s;ounding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> demand &s;ilence, the re|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of a cannon from the quarter of the Ba&s;tile was heav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and at the &s;ame moment, an immen&s;e cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d precipitated them&s;elves into the &s;quare, fronting the hotel, with the cry of trea&s;on. And to &s;upport the charge, they brought with them a citizen, and a &s;oldier of the French guards, both wounded. The rumour was, that fifteen or twenty more, wounded at the &s;ame time, were left to be taken care of, in different hou&s;es on the way; for that the governor, Delaunay, had let down the fir&s;t draw-bridge to engage the people to approach, who were demanding arms; and that they, entering with confidence on this invita|tion, had immediately received a di&s;charge of all the mu&s;ketry of the fortre&s;s. This report, con|firmed by the pre&s;ence of the two wounded men, demon&s;trated to the committee the perfidy of the troops who guarded the Ba&s;tile, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending &s;uccour to tho&s;e, who, without order or &s;ufficient force, had commenced the attack. Mean time the fury of the people was directed again&s;t the mayor, who endeavoured by various &s;ubterfuges to appea&s;e the rage which had been excited by his vain promi&s;es of procuring arms. He had, it is true, &s;everal times di&s;per&s;ed the multitude by &s;ending them to different places with orders for arms, where he knew they were not

to be found; and now, to &s;ilence the &s;u&s;picions that threatened to break out in &s;ome dreadful acts of violence, involving the whole committee in the &s;ame de&s;truction, he offered to make one of the third deputation; the &s;econd appearing to be detained, to remon&s;trate with Delaunay, and try to prevent an effu&s;ion of blood. A drum and colours were ordered to attend them, becau&s;e it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that the want of &s;ome &s;ignal had prevented the others from executing their com|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Shortly after their departure, however, the &s;econd deputation returned, and informed the committee, that, in their way to the Ba&s;tile, they had met a wounded citizen, carried by his companions, who informed them, that he had received a &s;hot from a fu&s;il, fired from the Ba&s;tile into the &s;treet St. Antoine; and that immediately after they had been &s;topped by a crowd, who were guarding three invalids, taken firing on their fellow citizens. Judging by the&s;e events, added they, that the danger was in|crea&s;ing, we ha&s;tened our &s;teps, animated by the hope of putting a &s;top to &s;uch an unequal com|bat. Arrived within an hundred paces of the fortre&s;s, we perceived the &s;oldiers on the towers firing upon the &s;treet St. Antoine, and we heard the report of the guns of the citizens in the court, di&s;charged on the garri&s;on. Drawing nearer, we made &s;everal &s;ignals to the governor, which were either unob&s;erved, or di&s;regarded. We then approached the gate, and &s;aw the people, almo&s;t all without any thing to defend them&s;elves, ru&s;hing forward expo&s;ed to the bri&s;k fire of artillery, that hailed directly down upon them,
<PB N="138" REF="029916_0149_0FE30A12197FDCD0">
making great havoc. We prevailed on tho&s;e who had arms, to &s;top firing for a moment, whil&s;t we reiterated our &s;ignal of peace; but the garri&s;on, regardle&s;s of it, continued their di&s;|charges, and we had the grief to &s;ee fall, by our &s;ides, &s;everal of the people, who&s;e hands we had &s;topped. The courage of the re&s;t, again in flamed by indignation, pu&s;hed them forward.&mdash;Our re|mon&s;trances, our prayers, had no longer any effect; and they declared, that it was not a deputation they now wi&s;hed for.&mdash;It was the &s;iege of the Ba&s;tile&mdash;the de&s;truction of that hor|rible pri&s;on&mdash;the death of the governor, that they demanded, with loud cries. Repul&s;ed by the&s;e brave citizens, we p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtook their momentary indignation, &s;o fully ju&s;tified by the abominable act of perfidy, with which they charged the governor.&mdash;They then repeated the information which has already reached you&mdash;that in the morning a crowd having approached the Ba&s;tile to demand arms, the governor had allowed a certain number to enter, and then had fired upon them. Thus the trea&s;on of the governor had been the fir&s;t &s;ignal of a war, that he him&s;elf had begun with his fellow citizens, and &s;eemed willing to continue ob&s;tinately, &s;ince he refu&s;ed to attend to the deputation. Through all parts it was now re&s;ounded.&mdash;'Let us take the Ba&s;tile!' &mdash;And five pieces of cannon, conducted by this cry, were ha&s;tening to the action.</P>
<P>Some time after, the third deputation al&s;o came back, and recounted, that, at the &s;ight of their white flag, one had been hoi&s;ted on the top of the Ba&s;tile, and the &s;oldiers had grounded their arms;&mdash;that under the au&s;pices of the&s;e en&s;igns

of peace, the deputies had engaged the people, in the name of the permanent committee, to re|tire to their di&s;tricts, and take the mea&s;ures the mo&s;t proper to re-e&s;tabli&s;h tranquility&mdash;and, that this retreat was actually taking place; the peo|ple all naturally pa&s;&s;ing through the court where the deputation remained.&mdash;When, notwith&s;tand|ing the white emblem of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition, di&s;played on the tower, the deputies &s;aw a piece of cannon planted directly at the court, and they received a &s;udden di&s;charge of mu&s;ketry, which killed three per&s;ons at their feet&mdash;that this atro|city, at the moment they were calming the people, had thrown them into a tran&s;port of rage; and many of them had even held their bayonets at the brea&s;ts of the deputies; &s;aying,
<Q>you are al&s;o traitors, and have brought us here that we might be more ea&s;ily killed</Q>
&mdash;and it would have been difficult to calm them, if one of the deputies had not bid them ob&s;erve, that they &s;hared the &s;ame danger. The efferve&s;cence then abating, they ha&s;tened back and met 300 of the French guards, followed by the cannons taken at the invalids, all marching with a quick &s;tep, crying that they were going to take the Ba&s;tile. One of the deputies, who had been &s;eparated from the re&s;t, further recited;&mdash;that having been obliged to &s;cramble over the dead and dying to e&s;cape, the people, who recognized him as an elector, de&s;ired him to &s;ave him&s;elf&mdash;for that the trea&s;on was manife&s;t.
<Q>It is rather you, my friends, he replied, who ought to retire; you who hinder our &s;oldiers and cannons from entering this encumbered court, where you are all going to peri&s;h, for no purpo&s;e.</Q>
But, that

they interrupted him in a tran&s;port, exclaiming&mdash;
<Q>No!&mdash;No! our dead bodies will &s;erve to fill up the trench.</Q>
He therefore retired with the balls hi&s;&s;ing about his ears. The&s;e recitals, and the rumor of the &s;econd act of treachery, &s;pread|ing through the city, violently agitated minds already alive to &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Fre&s;h crowds continually ru&s;hed into the <HI>H&ocirc;tel-de-Ville,</HI> and again they threatened to &s;et fire to it, repeating how many times the mayor had deceived them. And, when he attempted to calm them by making plau&s;ible excu&s;es, they &s;topped his mouth by &s;aying, with one voice,&mdash; 'he &s;eeks to gain time by making us lo&s;e our's.

<P>In this moment of &s;olitude and terror, a man entered with affright vi&s;ible on every feature, &s;aying, that the &s;quare trembled with the rage of the people; and that they had devoted all of them to death.&mdash;'Depart!' he exclaimed, running out,
<Q>&s;ave your&s;elves while you can&mdash;or you are all lo&s;t!</Q>
But they remained &s;till; and were not long permitted in &s;ilence to anticipate the
<PB N="141" REF="029916_0152_0FE30AAE92690728">
approach of danger; for one party of people following another, brought in a number of their wounded companions:&mdash;and tho&s;e who brought them, de&s;cribed with pa&s;&s;ion the carnage of the citizens &s;acrificed under the ramparts of the Ba&s;tile. This carnage, the military officers attri|buted to the di&s;order of the attack, and to the intrepidity of the a&s;&s;ailants &s;till greater than the di&s;order.</P>
<P>The accounts of the &s;laughter, neverthele&s;s, were certainly very much exaggerated; for the fortre&s;s appears to have been taken by the force of mind of the multitude, pre&s;&s;ing forward re|gardle&s;s of danger. The ardor of the be&s;iegers, rather than their numbers, threw the garri&s;on into confu&s;ion; for the Ba&s;tile was ju&s;tly reckoned the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t terrific pri&s;on in Europe, or perhaps in the world. It was always guarded by a con&s;iderable number of troops, and the governor had been previou&s;ly prepared for its de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce; but the unexpected impetuo&s;ity of the Pari&s;ians was &s;uch as nothing could with&s;tand. It is cer|tain, that Delaunay, at fir&s;t, de&s;pi&s;ed the attempt of the people; and was more anxious to &s;ave from injury or pillage, a &s;mall elegant hou&s;e he had built in the outer court, than to avoid flaughter. Afterwards, however, in the madne&s;s of de&s;pair, he is &s;aid to have rolled down large ma&s;&s;es of &s;tone from the platform on the heads of the people, to have endeavoured to blow up the fortre&s;s, and even to kill him&s;elf. The French guards, it is true, who mixed with the multitude, were of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice in &s;torming the Ba&s;tile, by advi&s;ing them to bring the cannon, and take &s;ome other mea&s;ures, that only military experience
<PB N="142" REF="029916_0153_0FE309EC78C64188">
could have dictated; but the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the moment rendered a knowledge of the art of war needle&s;s; and re&s;olution, more powerful than all the engines and batteries in the world, made the draw-bridges fall, and the walls give way.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t then the people were carrying every thing before them, the committee only thought of preventing the further effu&s;ion of blood. Another deputation was therefore nominated, more numerous than had hitherto been &s;ent; and they were ju&s;t &s;etting out on this errand of peace, when &s;ome voices announced, that the Ba&s;tile was taken. Little attention, however, was paid to them; and the news was &s;o impro|bable, that the impre&s;&s;ion made by the rumour was not &s;ufficiently &s;trong to &s;top the outrages of the mob, who were &s;till menacing the mayor and the committee.&mdash;When a fre&s;h uproar, heard at fir&s;t at &s;uch a di&s;tance that it could not be di&s;|tingui&s;hed, whether it was a cry of victory or of alarm, advancing with the cra&s;h and rapidity of a tempe&s;t, came to confirm the unlooked for intel|ligence.&mdash;For the Ba&s;tile was taken!</P>
<P>At the in&s;tant even the great hall was inundated by a crowd of all ranks, carrying arms of every kind.&mdash;The tumult was inexpre&s;&s;ible&mdash;and to increa&s;e it, &s;ome one called out, that the hotel was giving way, under the mingled &s;hout of vic|tory and trea&s;on! vengeance and liberty!&mdash;About thirty invalids and Swi&s;s &s;oldiers were then drag|ged into the hall, who&s;e death the multitude imperiou&s;ly demanded.&mdash;Hang them! Hang them! was the univer&s;al roar.</P>
<P>An officer of the queen's regiment of guards (M. Elie) was brought in on the &s;houlders of the
<PB N="143" REF="029916_0154_0FE30AB67B868A68">
conquerors of the Ba&s;tile, and proclaimed by them, as the fir&s;t of the citizens, who had ju&s;t made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it. The efforts he u&s;ed to repre&s;s the te&s;timonies of honour, which were lavi&s;hed on him, were of no avail; and he was placed, in &s;pite of his mode&s;ty, on a table oppo&s;ite the committee, and &s;urrounded by the pri&s;oners, who &s;eemed to be &s;tanding in fearful expectation of their doom. In this &s;ituation he was crowned, and trophies of arms awkwardly placed around, to which &s;entiment and circum|&s;tances gave dignity. All the plate taken at the Ba&s;tile was brought to him, and his comrades pre&s;&s;ed him, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, to accept it, as the riche&s;t &s;poil of the vanqui&s;hed enemy. But he refu&s;ed with firmne&s;s, explaining the motives of his refu&s;al &s;o eloquently, he per&s;uaded all who heard him, that the &s;poil did not belong to them; and that patrioti&s;m, jealous only of glory and honour, would blu&s;h at receiving a pecuniary recompence.&mdash;And making a noble u&s;e of the a&s;cendency which he had over the people, he began to recommend moderation and cle|mency.&mdash;But he was &s;oon interrupted by the account of the death of Delaunay; &s;eized in the court of the Ba&s;tile, and dragged by the furious populace almo&s;t to the <HI>H&ocirc;tel-de-ville,</HI> before he was ma&s;&s;acred.&mdash;And &s;oon after the death of three other officers was reported.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners li&s;tened to the&s;e tales with the countenances of victims ready to be &s;acrificed, whil&s;t the exa&s;perated crowd demanded their in&s;tant execution. One of the electors &s;poke in their favour, but was &s;carcely permitted to go on. The people, indeed, were principally enraged

One of them was wounded, and con&s;equently in&s;pired more compa&s;&s;ion. The marquis de la Salle placed him&s;elf before this poor wretch, and forcing, in &s;ome degree, the people to hear him, he in&s;i&s;ted on the authority which he ought to have as commander in chief; adding, that he only wi&s;hed to &s;ecure the culprits, that they might be judged with all the rigour of martial law. The people &s;eemed to approve of his rea&s;oning; and taking advantage of this fa|vourable turn, he made the wounded invalid pa&s;s into another apartment.&mdash;But, whil&s;t he was pre&s;erving the life of this unfortunate man, the mob hurried the other two out of the hall, and immediately hung them on the adjacent lamp|po&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lamp-po&s;ts, which are only to be found in &s;quares, and places where there are not two rows of hou&s;es, are much more &s;ub&s;tantial than in England.</NOTE>. The efferve&s;cence, neverthele&s;s, in &s;pite of this overflowing of fury, &s;till continued, and was not even damped by the&s;e cruel acts of re|taliation. Two &s;entiments agitated the public mind&mdash;the joy of having conquered, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;ire of vengeance.

The mayor, however, had given &s;ufficient proofs of his di&s;po&s;ition to &s;upport the court, to ju&s;tify the rage which was breaking out again&s;t him; and a general cry having been rai&s;ed around him, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him

<P>Mean time the clamour again&s;t the re&s;t of the invalids redoubled. But the French guards, who entered in groups, reque&s;ted as a recompen&s;e for the &s;ervice which they had rendered to their country the pardon of their old comrades; and M. Elie joined in the reque&s;t; adding, that this favour would be more grateful to his heart, than all the gifts and honours which they wi&s;hed to lavi&s;h on him. Touched by his eloquence, &s;ome cried out&mdash;Pardon! and the &s;ame emotion &s;preading throughout the circle&mdash;Pardon!

Elie propo&s;ed making the pri&s;oners take an oath of fidelity to the nation and the city of Paris; and this pro|po&s;ition was received with te&s;timonies of general &s;atisfaction. The oath being admini&s;tered, the French guards &s;urrounded the pri&s;oners and car|ried them away, in the mid&s;t of them, without meeting with any re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The committee now endeavoured to re-e&s;tabli&s;h &s;omething like order, for in the tumult the table had been broken down, and de&s;truction menaced on every &s;ide&mdash;when a man entered to inform them, that an unknown, but, indeed, a merciful hand, had &s;hot the mayor, and thus by the only po&s;&s;ible mean &s;natched him from the popular fury.

<P>The Ba&s;tile was taken about four o'clock in the afternoon; and after the &s;truggle to &s;ave the pri&s;oners, &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary regulations were pro|po&s;ed, to &s;ecure the public &s;afety. The conduct of the men in office had &s;o irritated the people, that the cry again&s;t ari&s;tocrats was now rai&s;ed; and a number of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction were brought to the <HI>H&ocirc;tel-de-ville</HI> this evening, by the re&s;tle&s;s populace, who, roving abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, &s;eemed to create &s;ome of the adventur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which were nece&s;&s;ary to employ their awakened &s;pirit.

Not, therefore, allowing them|&s;elves to &s;leep on their conquering arms, this was, likewi&s;e, a watchful night; for the taking of the Ba&s;tile, though it was a proof the courage and re&s;olution of the Pari&s;ians, by no means &s;ecured them again&s;t the in&s;idious &s;chemes of the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> They had &s;hown their determination to re&s;i&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion very forcibly; but the troops that ex|cited their re&s;i&s;tance were &s;till apparently waiting for an opportunity to de&s;troy them.

Thus was the nation &s;aved by the almo&s;t incredible exertion of an indignant people; who felt, for the fir&s;t time, that they were &s;overeign, and that their power was commen&s;urate to their will. This was certainly a &s;plendid example, to prove, that nothing can re&s;i&s;t a people determined to live free; and then it appeared clear, that the freedom of France did not depend on a few men, whatev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r might be their virtues or abilities, but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one on the will of the nation.</P>

pre&s;ence of the troops at Ver&s;ailles, the &s;ub&s;tan|tiated facts, and the &s;u&s;pected pro&s;criptions, gave to this &s;itting the involuntary emotions, that mu&s;t naturally be produced by the approach of a ca|ta&s;trophe, which was to decide the &s;alvation or de&s;truction of the &s;tate.

He lamented the di&s;order that reigned in the capital, and reque&s;ted them to think of &s;ome method to bring back order and tranquillity.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE effect produced by the duplicity of courts mu&s;t be very great, when the vici&s;&s;itudes which had happened at Ver&s;ailles, could not teach every per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e, that the moment was arrived, when &s;ubterfuge and treachery could no longer e&s;cape detection and puni&s;hment; and that the only po&s;&s;ibility of ob|taining the durable confidence of the people was by that &s;trict attention to ju&s;tice, which produces a dignified &s;incerity of action. For after the unravelling of the plot, contrived to cheat the expectation of the people, it was natural to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+po&s;e, that they would entertain the mo&s;t wakeful &s;u&s;picion of every per&s;on who had been p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to it.</P>
<P>It would have been fortunate for France, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the unhappy Louis, if his coun&s;ellors could have profited by experience.

of which had for a moment di&s;concerted the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, we &s;hall find, that the continual di&s;&s;imulation of the king, and the &s;tratagems of his advi&s;ers, were the principal though perhaps not the &s;ole cau&s;e of his ruin. He appears to have &s;ometimes mi&s;tru&s;ted the cabal; yet, with that mixture of facility and ob&s;tinacy in his character, the con|comitants of indolence of mind, he allowed him|&s;elf to be governed without attempting to form any principle of action to regulate his conduct. For if he had ever really de&s;ired to be u&s;eful to his people, and to lighten their accumulated burdens, as has been continually in&s;i&s;ted, he was a&s;toni&s;hingly defective in judgment not to &s;ee, that he was &s;urrounded with &s;ycophants, who fat|tened on their hearts blood, u&s;ing his own hand to brand his name with infamy. It may po&s;&s;ibly be urged in reply, that this yielding temper was a proof of the king's benign de&s;ire to promote the felicity of his &s;ubjects, and prevent the hor|rors of anarchy. To confute &s;uch remarks, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate, that the preparations which had been made to di&s;&s;olve the national a&s;&s;embly, and to reduce the people to entire &s;ub|jection, if they were not his immediate contri|vance, mu&s;t have had his &s;anction, to give them efficiency; and that the tergiver&s;ation, which he employed on this occa&s;ion, was &s;ufficient to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y other tran&s;action of his reign &s;u&s;pected. And this will be found to be the ca&s;e in all the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ps he afterwards took to conciliate the people, which were little regarded after the evaporation of the lively emotions they excited; whil&s;t the want of morals in the court, and even in the a&s;&s;embly, made a prevailing mi&s;tru&s;t produce a
<PB N="159" REF="029916_0170_0FE30AD684438998">
capriciou&s;ne&s;s of conduct throughout the empire. Perhaps, it is vain to expect, that a depraved nation, whatever examples of heroi&s;m, and noble in&s;tances of di&s;intere&s;ted conduct, it may exhibit on &s;udden emergencies, or at the fir&s;t &s;tatement of an u&s;eful reform, will ever pur&s;ue with &s;teadi|ne&s;s the great objects of public good, in the direct path of virtuous ambition.</P>
<P>If the calamities, however, which have follow|ed in France the taking of the Ba&s;tile, (a noble effort,) be attributed partly to ignorance, or only to want of morals, the evils are in no degree le&s;&s;ened; neither does it ju&s;tify the conduct of the virulent oppo&s;ers of tho&s;e manly exertions in&s;pired by the voice of rea&s;on. The removal of a thou&s;and grinding oppre&s;&s;ions had been de|manded;&mdash;and promi&s;ed, to delude the public; who finding, at la&s;t, that the hopes, which had &s;oftened their mi&s;ery, were likely to be bla&s;ted by the intrigues of courtiers, can we wonder, that the worm the&s;e courtiers were trying to cru&s;h, turned on the foot prepared to &s;tamp it to nothing.</P>
<P>The complication of laws in every country ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tended to bewilder the under&s;tanding of man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;cience of government; and whil&s;t artful politicians have taken advantage of the ignorance or credulity of their fellow citizens, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to prevent a degeneracy of morals, be|cau&s;e impunity will always be a &s;timulus to the pa&s;&s;ions.

will require a &s;implification of laws, an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of equal rights, and the re&s;pon&s;ibility of mini&s;ters, to &s;ecure a ju&s;t and enlightened policy.

<P>And we ought not to be di&s;couraged from attempting this &s;implification, becau&s;e no country has yet been able to do it; &s;ince it &s;eems clear, that manners and government have been in a continual and progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of improvement, and that the exten&s;ion of knowledge, a truth capable of demon&s;tration, was never at any period &s;o general as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>If at one epocha of civilization we know, that all the improvements which were made in arts and &s;ciences were &s;uddenly overturned, both in Greece and Rome, we need not inquire, why &s;uperficial rea&s;oners have been induced to think, that there is only a certain degree of civilization to which men are capable of attaining, without receding back to a &s;tate of barbari&s;m, by the horrid con&s;equences of anarchy; though it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the cau&s;es which pro|duced that event can never have the &s;ame effect again:&mdash;becau&s;e a degree of knowledge has been

It now, in|deed, appeared certain, that Germany would gain in future important political advantages; for men were beginning to pre&s;ume to think, and &s;canned the conduct of the &s;upercilious Jo&s;eph with freedom, treating his vanity with contempt.</P>

<P>The overweening pre&s;umption, however, of men ignorant of true political &s;cience; who be|held a nation pro&s;perous beyond example, whil&s;t all the neighbouring &s;tates were langui&s;hing, and knew not how to account for it; fooli&s;hly en|deavouring to pre&s;erve this pro&s;perity, by mad attempts to throw impediments in the way of tho&s;e very principles, which had rai&s;ed Great Britain to the elevated rank &s;he has attained in Europe, &s;erved only to accelerate their diffu&s;ion.

<P>THE pre&s;ence of the deputies had diffu&s;ed throughout the capital the mo&s;t intoxicating joy &mdash;for where is joy expre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch infantile playfulne&s;s, &s;uch entire forgetfulne&s;s of to-mor|row, as at Paris? and the citizens, with their u&s;ual bur&s;t of gratitude, which always re&s;embles adoration, made choice of Baillie, the fir&s;t acting pre&s;ident of the national a&s;&s;embly, for mayor,

and of La Fayette for commander in chief of the national guards: the name now given to the <HI>garde-bourgeoi&s;e,</HI> and the other &s;oldiers incorpo|rated with them. But the rapture of the Pa|ri&s;ians, as tran&s;ient as lively, dwindled, as their &s;pirits were exhau&s;ted, into the murmurs of &s;u&s;picion.&mdash;The mini&s;try, &s;aid they, who were cho&s;en to depre&s;s us, are not yet di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and the troops, that were to have been their in&s;tru|ments of mi&s;chief, &s;till hov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r round Paris, and are even augmented by the arrival of two fre&s;h regiments at St. Denis. A rumour was &s;pread, that a convoy of flour had been intercepted by the order of the mini&s;ters, in its way to Paris; and &s;ome di&s;turbances at the Ba&s;tile had given colour to a report, that they had attempted to make them&s;elves once more ma&s;ters of this important fortre&s;s. The night of the 15th was then another devoted to watchfulne&s;s and anxiety; and in the morning a deputation was &s;ent to the national a&s;&s;embly, praying them to demand the di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, and the recal of Necker.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly took the &s;ubject into delibera|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; but &s;till attentive to <HI>etiquette,</HI> they debated about the decorum of interfering with the ap|pointment of the executive power. This rou&s;ed the genius of Mirabeau; and the bubbles of fear, and the &s;traw-like objections of timidity, were carried away by the torrent of his eloquence. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion grew warm; yet for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion &s;oon became of little importance, be|cau&s;e the mini&s;try, finding that they could not &s;tand the brunt of the &s;torm, re&s;igned; Necker al&s;o, in whom the public had &s;till the mo&s;t im|plicit

confidence, was invited to return;&mdash;and the king appearing to be anxious to give every proof of his de&s;ire to e&s;tabli&s;h general tranquil|lity, &s;ignified, that he wi&s;hed to vi&s;it Paris. A &s;hort time after they were officially informed that the troops were promptly removing to more di&s;tant quarters. The national a&s;&s;embly accord|ingly &s;ent &s;ome of their members to communicate to the Pari&s;ians this welcome intelligence, to prepare for the reception of the king by calming the fears of the people.</P>
<P>And he, adhering to his purpo&s;e, left Ver|&s;ailles the next day (the 17th), though his family ridiculou&s;ly endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him; in&s;i|nuating, that he ought not to tru&s;t his &s;acred per&s;on to the mercy of an enraged multitude; whil&s;t rumours of projected a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations were repeated befor him, with exaggerated com|ments. But, being a man of con&s;iderable animal courage, and now almo&s;t perceiving, that all the evils with which he was &s;truggling had been produced by his head&s;trong advi&s;ers, he &s;eemed determined, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, not to be governed by their dangerous councils. And he had even the &s;agacity to fore&s;ee, that, convul&s;ed as the kingdom was, they would occa&s;ion a civil war, and his life might then be &s;till more expo&s;ed. In this in&s;tance, as we &s;hall find in many others, Louis appears to have been directed by a kind of glimmering in&s;tinct of propriety; for at the pre|&s;ent juncture it was particularly di&s;creet, con&s;i|dering the little effect the pageantry of the court had produced at the <HI>S&eacute;ance-royale,</HI> to meet the people without the parade of robes or guards. And, in fact, the hundred deputies who followed

him, were now the only retinue that would have appeared re&s;pectable in the eyes of the people What too mu&s;t have been his &s;urpri&s;e, in &s;pite of all he had heard, to pa&s;s through an immen&s;e avenue of armed Pari&s;ians with &s;uch a new a&s;pect. &mdash;Till now he had always &s;een a timid multitude flying before the watch, giving vent to their vengeance in vain &s;ongs, and to their grief in feeble murmurs:&mdash;to-day he &s;aw them trium|phant, moving orderly along, calling out on every &s;ide, during the proce&s;&s;ion, for a con&s;titu|tion and laws! marching in uni&s;on with their reflections, they advanced, but &s;lowly; for, al|mo&s;t afraid to hope, they proceeded with the mea&s;ured &s;tep of thought, or rather &s;adne&s;s; and the people, who&s;e mind was &s;till agitated, as the &s;well of the &s;ea continues after the &s;torm has &s;ub&s;ided, uttered not the &s;hout of gladne&s;s&mdash; <HI>vive-la-roi;</HI>&mdash;but the menacing memento&mdash;<HI>vive-la-nation.</HI></P>
<P>This was as ominous a &s;ound, as the woe! woe! re&s;ounding through the &s;ilent &s;treets of a be&s;ieged city&mdash;for it was equally the voice of fate, proclaiming the will of the people, di&s;gu&s;ted with courts, and &s;u&s;picious even of the king. Louis &s;eems to have been forcibly &s;truck by the energy every where di&s;played; and not more by the elo|quent di&s;cour&s;es addre&s;&s;ed to him at the H&ocirc;tel-de-ville, than by the countenance of each citizen: for the fire of liberty had already lighted up in every face the &s;erene lu&s;tre of manly firmne&s;s.&mdash; So impre&s;&s;ed, indeed, was his mind by the whole &s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, that, when the animated &s;peakers were &s;ilent, he exclaimed in reply&mdash;

taking the national cockade from the hands of the mayor, he appeared at the window with his heart in his eyes, as if eager to convince the multitude of his &s;incerity: and perhaps con&s;cious, that, fir&s;t &s;ubmitting to nece&s;&s;ity, he now yielded to feeling. At the&s;e words, the repetition of which flew like lightning from rank to rank, the whole concour&s;e, of people caught the electrical &s;ympathy.&mdash;<HI>Vive-le-roi</HI> was &s;houted from every quarter; and revived affection glowed with the fre&s;h fervour, that effaces the remembrance of doubts, and makes the fear of having been unju&s;t, the mo&s;t powerful &s;pring of tenderne&s;s. And per&s;uading them&s;elves, for the moment, that the di&s;po&s;ition of the king was not &s;o much at variance with their happine&s;s as his conduc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d ble&s;&s;ings on him, be&s;towing all their exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns on his coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure, now almo&s;t mounting to a feveri&s;h height, &s;et all Paris quickly in motion; and the &s;ound of the thundering artillery was the &s;wift harbinger of the tidings of reconciliation to Ver&s;ailles, where the royal family mu&s;t have been anxiou&s;ly alive to the events of the day.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;udden tran&s;itions from one extreme to another, without leaving any &s;ettled conviction behind, to confirm or eradicate the corroding di&s;tru&s;t, could not be &s;een in &s;uch a &s;trong light any where as at Paris, becau&s;e there a variety of cau&s;es have &s;o effeminated rea&s;on, that the French may be con&s;idered as a nation of women; and made feeble, probably, by the &s;ame combination of circum&s;tances, as has rendered the&s;e in&s;ignifi|cant. More ingenious than profound in their re&s;earches; more tender than impa&s;&s;ioned in their
<PB N="182" REF="029916_0192_0FE30B198BED5458">
affections; prompt to act, yet &s;oon weary; they &s;eem to work only to e&s;cape from work, and to reflect merely how they &s;hall avoid reflection. Indolently re&s;tle&s;s, they make the elegant furni|ture of their rooms, like their hou&s;es, voluptu|ou&s;ly handy. Every thing, in &s;hort, &s;hows the dexterity of the people, and their attention to pre&s;ent enjoyment.</P>
<P>And &s;o pa&s;&s;ive appears to be their imagination, it requires to be rou&s;ed by novelty; and then, more lively than &s;trong, the evane&s;cent emotions &s;carcely leave any traces behind them. From being devoted to plea&s;ure in their youth, old age is commonly pa&s;&s;ed in &s;uch merely animal grati|fications, that a re&s;pectable looking aged man or woman is very rarely to be &s;een. Independent, likewi&s;e, of the vanity which makes them wi&s;h to appear polite, at the very moment they are ridiculing a per&s;on, their great &s;u&s;ceptibility of di&s;po&s;ition leads them to take an intere&s;t in all the &s;en&s;ations of others, which are forgotten almo&s;t as &s;oon as felt. And the&s;e tran&s;ient gu&s;ts of feeling prevent their forming tho&s;e firm re&s;olves of rea&s;on, that bracing the nerves, when the heart is moved, make &s;ympathy yield to principles, and the mind triumph over the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the climate of France is &s;o genial, and the blood mounted &s;o checrily in the veins, even of the oppre&s;&s;ed common people, that, living for the day, they continually ba&s;ked in the &s;un&s;hine, which broke from behind the heavy clouds that hung over them.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, after tracing the horrid con|&s;piracy formed by the court again&s;t the lives and
<PB N="183" REF="029916_0193_0FE30AF291B67838">
liberty of the people, not to feel the mo&s;t ineffa|ble contempt for that kind of government, which leaves the happine&s;s of a nation at the mercy of a capricious mini&s;ter of &s;tate. The awful and intere&s;ting le&s;&s;on, which the developement of this treachery afforded, was &s;uch as ought to have made an indelible impre&s;&s;ion on their minds.&mdash;It was a le&s;&s;on, the very thought of which &s;tops for a moment the genial current of the heart.&mdash;It was a le&s;&s;on, that &s;hould be repeated to mankind; to bring home to their very &s;en&s;es a conviction of the lengths to which a depraved and ab&s;olute government will go, for the &s;ake of holding fa&s;t it's power.&mdash;It was, in &s;hort, a deduction of ex|perience, which will teach po&s;terity that life, and every thing dear to man, can be &s;ecured only by the pre&s;ervation of liberty.</P>
<P>The want of deci&s;ion in the character of Louis &s;eems to have been the foundation of all his faults, as well as of all his misfortunes; and every mo|ment fre&s;h occa&s;ions to make the ob&s;ervation ari&s;e as we trace his mi&s;conduct, or compa&s;&s;ionate his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>To give a &s;triking in&s;tance, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to turn our attention to the fatal effects that flow|ed from his con&s;enting to a&s;&s;emble an army of foreigners, to intimidate the &s;tates-general. He could not re&s;i&s;t the court, who coun&s;elled this mea&s;ure; or &s;ilence the mi&s;givings of his heart, which made him aver&s;e to the troops taking any deci&s;ive &s;tep, that lead to &s;laughter. And &s;till governed by the&s;e undi&s;ciplined feelings, when he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the army he pur&s;ued the advice of the very cabal, that had led him into this error; giving way to the wi&s;hes of the people,

yet di&s;&s;embling with them even in the act of re|conciliation. Thus, for ever wavering, it is dif|ficult to mark any fixed purpo&s;e in his actions; excepting that which does him honour&mdash;the de|&s;ire to prevent the &s;hedding of blood. This prin|ciple has, in general, directed his conduct; though the &s;hort-&s;ighted mea&s;ures of timid hu|manity, devoid of &s;trength of mind, turned all his efforts to a very contrary effect.</P>
<P>From the pre&s;ence of the&s;e troops, and their abortive attempt to cru&s;h liberty in the egg, the &s;hell was prematurely broken, and the enthu&s;ia&s;m of Frenchmen excited before their judgment was in any con&s;iderable degree formed. Intoxicated by conque&s;t, each began to de&s;cant on the exi&s;t|ing abu&s;es, to &s;how his own cleverne&s;s in point|ing out the remedy; and arms being once in the hands of the people, it was difficult to per&s;uade them to give them up for the occupations of peace. It is true, had the national a&s;&s;embly been allowed quietly to have made &s;ome reforms, paving the way for more, the Ba&s;tile, though tottering on its dungeons, might yet have &s;tood erect.&mdash;And, if it had, the &s;um of human mi&s;ery could &s;carcely have been increa&s;ed.

<P>The character of the French, indeed, had been &s;o depraved by the inveterate de&s;poti&s;m of ages, that even amid&s;t the heroi&s;m which di&s;tingui&s;hed the taking of the Ba&s;tile, we are forced to &s;ee that &s;u&s;picious temper, and that vain ambition of dazzling, which have generated all the &s;ucceed|ing follies and crimes. For, even in the mo&s;t public-&s;pirited actions, celebrity &s;eems to have been the &s;pur, and the glory, rather than the happine&s;s of Frenchmen, the end.&mdash;This ob&s;er|vation enforces the grand truth on mankind, that without morality there can be no great &s;trength of under&s;tanding, or real dignity of conduct. The morals of the whole nation were de&s;troyed by the manners formed by the government.&mdash; Plea&s;ure had been pur&s;ued, to fill up the void of rational employment; and fraud combined with &s;ervility to deba&s;e the character;&mdash;&s;o that, when they changed their &s;y&s;tem, liberty, as it was called, was only the acme of tyranny&mdash;merely with this difference, that, all the force of nature being rou&s;ed, the magnitude of the evil promi&s;ed, by &s;ome mighty concu&s;&s;ion, to effect it's own cure.</P>
<P>The reunion of the king and people not only routed, but terrified, the cabal; and as cowardly in adver&s;ity, as pre&s;umptuous in pro&s;perity, they immediately took to flight different ways, and even di&s;gui&s;ed.

<P>The count d'Artois, with &s;everal others of the blood royal and principal nobility, likewi&s;e thought it prudent to leave the kingdom for the pre&s;ent; either to provide for their &s;afety, or to &s;eek vengeance. At Bru&s;&s;els they met the unquiet Calonne, who, having heard of the di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of Necker, was lured back by the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of hope. For wi&s;hing to wipe away the indignity, which he had &s;o impatiently brooked; and fondly believing, that the army had had &s;ufficient time to qua&s;h the verbal di&s;putes of the nation; he was ha&s;tening towards France, to be ready to come in for his &s;hare of the triumph.</P>
<P>To his country this meeting has proved a &s;ource of evil, that could only have been hatched in &s;uch an unprincipled brain, fertile in plans of mi&s;chief, and prone to puzzle the cau&s;e which he wanted force to &s;ubvert.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE duke of Liancourt, who&s;e warning voice had made the king look around him, when danger was at his heels, was now cho&s;en pre&s;i|dent. At this moment the ob&s;tacles, which at
<PB N="193" REF="029916_0203_0FE30B99A601B4B0">
fir&s;t clogged the exertions of the a&s;&s;embly, &s;eem|ed to have been overcome: &s;till fre&s;h ones &s;tart|ing up threw a damp on their exultation; and the apprehen&s;ions of a famine, real or facti|tious, were not the lea&s;t alarming, though the mo&s;t frequent.</P>
<P>New con&s;piracies were already formed on the borders of France, by the princes, and tho&s;e who had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the corruptions of the old &s;y&s;|tem. But this only proved a &s;timulus: becau&s;e the nation, being determined to &s;ecure the rights it had &s;o &s;uddenly regained, rai&s;ed new regi|ments in every part of the country, and was &s;oon in a &s;ituation to repel any attack, which it was po&s;&s;ible for all Germany to have made; the only quarter from which the fugitive princes, at that period, could expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance. So rapid was the &s;pirit, &s;o general the momentum, that in the cour&s;e of a week upwards of three mil|lions of men in arms were formed into companies by a common intere&s;t re&s;embling an electrical &s;ympathy. Such was the quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events&mdash;Such the unanimous &s;en&s;e of the na|tion; and &s;uch the formidable force which in&s;tantly oppo&s;ed it&s;elf to the impotent threats of departing de&s;poti&s;m. Hi&s;tory will record this memorable era, when the di&s;ciplined forces of the mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant tyranny vani&s;hed before the force of truth, though &s;till but half unveiled; obliging the haughty &s;ycophants to &s;earch for &s;helter in the rece&s;&s;es of a fore&s;t, whither they &s;tole under cover of the night from the pre&s;ence of an injured people.</P>

<P>The old municipal officers, mo&s;tly &s;u&s;pected, becau&s;e nominated by the friends of the court, were now obliged to give place to committees elected by the common voice. The&s;e taking the admini&s;tration of public bu&s;ine&s;s into their hands, a new order of things began every where to prevail. Still, however, the di&s;turbed imagina|tion of the people was filled with plots, to which &s;ome my&s;terious and fatal incidents gave life.</P>
<P>The municipality of Soi&s;&s;ons informed the national a&s;&s;embly, that troops of banditti had cut down the corn before it was ripe, and obliged the villagers to take refuge in the towns. But on further inquiry, it appeared, that this report aro&s;e from a &s;imple quarrel of the pea&s;ants among&s;t them&s;elves, which had alarmed &s;ome labourers, who flew to the neighbouring town, imagining that they had thou&s;ands of banditti at their heels.</P>
<P>Paris was al&s;o di&s;turbed by an idle rumour of a riot at St. Denis; &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly affirmed by tho&s;e, who declared that they had been eye-witne&s;&s;es of the violence, that troops and cannon were &s;ent, but they could find no traces of the di&s;turbance.</P>

This wanton act of barbarity, which the hi&s;torian al&s;o would fain believe a mon&s;trous chimera of heated brains, was, neverthele&s;s, as well &s;ub&s;tantiated, as &s;uch a fact could be; which nothing, but the confe&s;&s;ion of the guilty party, can render ab&s;o|lutely certain, becau&s;e it &s;eems equally fooli&s;h and barbarous.</P>

A vigorous mini&s;try was certainly nece&s;&s;ary to check the licentious &s;pirit manife&s;ting it&s;elf con|tinually by the acts of violence, in &s;o many parts of the kingdom, where tumults and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations were the effects of the giddine&s;s of unexpected &s;ucce&s;s. Whil&s;t complaining of the old govern|ment, every man in his &s;phere &s;eemed to be eager to try how he him&s;elf could govern, and make up for the time he had delegated his authority. Be&s;ides, the procra&s;tination of the relief looked for as the immediate con&s;equence of the Revolu|tion, however unavoidable, made the people not only murmur, but, di&s;regarding all rea&s;on, at|tempt to gain more by force than could, for a long time, be granted by ju&s;tice, even had ju&s;tice been unbia&s;&s;ed by &s;elf-intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The nation called for a con&s;titution; and the a&s;&s;embly debated about the declaration of rights inherent to man, and tho&s;e he gives up when he becomes a citizen, on which they de&s;igned to re&s;t it, as an explanatory &s;upport.</P>
<P>Several members argued, that the declaration ought to conclude, and not precede the con&s;titu|tion; in&s;i&s;ting, that it was dangerous to awaken a <HI>&s;omnambuli&s;t</HI> on the brink of a precipice; or to take a man to the top of a mountain, to &s;how him a va&s;t country that belonged to him, but of which he could not immediately claim the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>But Bernave terminated the &s;itting, though the que&s;tion was &s;till in debate, by ob&s;erving,
<Q>that the declaration of rights was in two re&s;pects practically u&s;eful;&mdash;fir&s;t, as it fixed the &s;pirit of the legi&s;lation, in order that it might not vary in future; and, &s;econdly, as it would direct the repre&s;entatives of the nation in the formation of laws, in all the details of legi&s;lation, the com|pletion of which could only be the work of time.

<P>Poizing thus the pillars of equal liberty, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion was the next day interrupted by the report made by the committee appointed for the purpo&s;e of dige&s;ting the information &s;ent to the a&s;&s;embly, of the melancholy intelligence which they daily received from the provinces.&mdash;
<Q>The taxes, the rents were no longer paid, the re|venue was exhau&s;ted, the laws were without force; and the &s;ocial ties almo&s;t broken.</Q>
To remedy &s;o many evils, the committee propo&s;ed to the a&s;&s;embly to publi&s;h, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, a &s;olemn declaration to te&s;tify their deep &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;ery of the provinces, and their di&s;approbation

<P>Some of the deputies repre&s;ented, that the feudal laws were too iniquitous,&mdash;the taxes too unequally a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed&mdash;the wretchedne&s;s too general, to hope for any happy effect from &s;uch a declara|tion&mdash;it would &s;oon fall into oblivion, as had done the proclamation for peace:&mdash;it would ag|gravate the mi&s;ery of the &s;tate, by manife&s;ting the impotence of the national a&s;&s;embly:&mdash;it would irritate even the people, who had need of com|fort; and of whom they could not, without a kind of deri&s;ion, in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tan|ces, require the payment of taxes, of which they knew well that each of them felt the in|ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Others did not fail to in&s;i&s;t on the danger of letting the di&s;order increa&s;e; on the &s;acredne&s;s of property; and on the immen&s;e <HI>deficit</HI> with which the nation was menaced; adding, that the national a&s;&s;embly would become contemptible, if it did not take the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures.&mdash; They further dilated on the nece&s;&s;ity of re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the authority of the courts of ju&s;tice;&mdash; and other arguments of the &s;ame tendency, which would have been more conclu&s;ive, more u&s;eful, if the &s;upporters of the declaration had brought forward the &s;hadow of a mode to a&s;&s;ure it's exe|cution. The debate from being warm became bitter, till it was at length re&s;olved that a declara|tion

&s;hould be i&s;&s;ued for the &s;ecurity of property, and that the remaining propo&s;als of the committee &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the next evening, the 4th of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>But, before they &s;eparated, the a&s;&s;embly was informed, that Broglio had ordered all the arms, depo&s;ited at the town-hou&s;e of Thionville, to be carried away.&mdash;This &s;tep appeared to them the height of imprudence, at a moment when the community was obliged to arm it&s;elf to watch over the public &s;afety.</P>
<P>The following morning it was decided by a great majority, that there &s;hould be a declara|tion of rights &s;eparate from the con&s;titution. The &s;itting of the evening was impatiently expected, and the oppo&s;ers of a new proclamation flattered them&s;elves, that they &s;hould &s;ecure the general &s;uffrage by making it appear, that patrioti&s;m demanded great &s;acrifices; and that in&s;tead of the vain formality of an exhortation, &s;oon de&s;|pi&s;ed by the people, it was nece&s;&s;ary to carry real offerings to the altar of peace.&mdash;This was the pur|port of a &s;peech made by one of the nobles, the vi&s;count de Noailles; who &s;howed, in a very forcible manner,

<Q>how are the relaxed ties of &s;ociety to be &s;trengthened? By calming the people,</Q>

<P N="1"><Q>1&s;t. That it be declared, before the procla|mation dige&s;ted by the committee, that the re|pre&s;entatives of the nation have decided to levy the impo&s;t, henceforward, in proportion to the income of each individual.</Q></P>

<P>The duke d'Aiguillon &s;econded this motion, which had been warmly applauded; or rather made another tending to the &s;ame end. For dreading the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of his pen&s;ion, when the <HI>Livre Rouge</HI> &s;hould be reviewed, he &s;uddenly from being a minion of the old court, became a loud patriot.

<Q>that the in|&s;urrection found it's excu&s;e in the vexations to which the people were &s;ubject. The lords of manors,</Q>
he ob&s;erves,

to which they become the victims. At this happy era when united for the public good, and di&s;engaged from all per&s;onal intere&s;t, we are going to labour for the regeneration of the &s;tate, it &s;eems to me, gentlemen, that it is nece&s;&s;ary, before e&s;tabli&s;hing this con&s;titution, &s;o de&s;ired by the nation, to prove to all the citizens, that our intention is to e&s;tabli&s;h, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, that equality of rights which alone can a&s;&s;ure their liberty.</Q></P>
<P>It too frequently happens, that men run from one extreme to another, and that de&s;pair adopts the mo&s;t violent mea&s;ures. The French people had long been groaning under the la&s;h of a thou|&s;and oppre&s;&s;ions; they were the hewers of wood and drawers of water for the cho&s;en few. It was, therefore, to be apprehended, after they had once thrown off the yoke, which had imprinted on their character the hateful &s;cars of &s;ervitude, that they would expect the mo&s;t unbridled free|dom, dete&s;ting all whole&s;ome re&s;traints, as reins they were not now bound to obey. From ob|&s;erving, perhaps, that this was the di&s;po&s;ition of the times, the political empirics have continually inflamed the foibles of the multitude, by flattering them. Thus the nobility, who&s;e order would pro|bably lo&s;e mo&s;t by the revolution, made the mo&s;t popular motions, to gain favour with the people; tickling the &s;pirit they could not tame. Thus al&s;o we have &s;een the de&s;perate leaders of factions &s;electing ingeniou&s;ly the terms <HI>&s;ans-culottes, citoyen,</HI> and <HI>egalit&eacute;,</HI> in order to cajole the minds of the vulgar; and hence it has happened, that, in pro|portion as this cajolery was more highly &s;ea&s;oned, the power of ruling has de&s;cended to the mo&s;t

<P>The feudal claims that in&s;ult humanity, and &s;how how near man is to the brute creation when laws are fir&s;t made, were afterwards attempted to be enumerated; but a general cry of indigna|tion and horror prevented the deputy from fini&s;h|ing the frightful picture of human deba&s;ement and brutality. The ve&s;tiges of the&s;e direful op|pre&s;&s;ions, however, were &s;till beld dear by the&s;e very men, who, not having the compa&s;s of morality to direct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> politics, were humane rather through w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of nerves th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;oundne&s;s of under&s;tanding.</P>

<P>This artful compliment rou&s;ed the bi&s;hop of Nancy to declare,

<P>As the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the propo&s;itions of the vi&s;count de Noailles advanced, the nece&s;&s;ity of effacing all the traces of &s;ervitude became more and more obvious; and all the members &s;eemed eager to point out to their colleagues the new &s;acrifices, that ought to be made to the good of their country.

<Q>he de|clared, that, animated by a de&s;ire to contribute to the relief of the people, they would relin|qui&s;h, from the pre&s;ent time, all their ca&s;ual (or &s;urplice) fees.</Q>
This offer, made with great &s;implicity of heart, affected the a&s;&s;embly; nor could a very different propo&s;al, made by the duke du Ch&acirc;telet, re&s;pecting the buying up of the tithes, efface it entirely.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ition to gaiety, when a member a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to offer al&s;o his &s;parrow, was very natural in a people, who always mix a degree of &s;arca&s;tic plea&s;antry, the good-humoured face of which fir&s;t appears, with the mo&s;t &s;erious things.

<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible, that the next morning the different parties could &s;carcely believe, that they had more than the imperfect recollection of a dream in their heads.

<P>It is true, the abolition of the&s;e privileges and powers had been &s;trictly enjoined, in the in&s;truc|tions given to the deputies by their con&s;titu|ents: but, it is doubtful, whether they would have been attended to, had not the mo&s;t &s;agaci|ous fore&s;een, that the neglect might occa&s;ion a ci|vil war.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE de&s;poti&s;m of the former government of France having formed the mo&s;t voluptuous, artificial characters, in the higher orders of &s;o|ciety, makes it le&s;s extraordinary to find the leading patriots men without principles or politi|cal knowledge, excepting what they had ca&s;ually gleaned from books, only read to while away an

idle hour not employed in plea&s;ure. So &s;uper|ficial indeed was their acquaintance with any &s;ubject that demanded thought&mdash;and &s;o great the degeneracy of their manners, it was natural for every man of reflection to infer, that a con&s;ider|able length of time mu&s;t elap&s;e before the new order of things, which they were about to create, could attain &s;tability. But this was not a di&s;|couraging con&s;ideration, when it was obvious, that important advantages had already been gain|ed by the people; and by the improvement of morals, which would nece&s;&s;arily follow, it was to be pre&s;umed, that the evils, the old &s;y&s;tem produced, would vani&s;h before gradual amend|ments; whil&s;t, by a practical knowledge of poli|tical and civil liberty, the great objects of the revolution would be a&s;certained; namely, ju&s;t laws, and equal liberty.</P>
<P>The depravity of the higher cla&s;s, and the ig|norance of the lower re&s;pecting practical politi|cal &s;cience, rendered them equally incapable of thinking for them&s;elves; &s;o that the mea&s;ures which flattered the foibles or gratified the weak|ne&s;s of either, were &s;ure to have great influence in producing a &s;chi&s;m in the public mind; which gave an opportunity to the enemies of the revolu|tion to impede its cour&s;e. And the number of the lower cla&s;s having its due weight, when they became free, the mo&s;t daring innovators became the greate&s;t favourites with the public, to who&s;e will every prudential con&s;ideration was obliged to yield.</P>
<P>Much had been gained on the 4th of Augu&s;t by the nation: the old forms of feudal va&s;&s;alage were completely overturned&mdash;and France then

&s;tood at the point the mo&s;t advantageous in which a government was ever con&s;tructed.&mdash; She &s;tood fair as the dawn of her liberty, having &s;haken off the prejudices of ages; and rea&s;on was tracing out the road, which leads to virtue, glory, and happine&s;s&mdash;Still ambitious &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, melancholy drawback! governed too great a proportion of the a&s;&s;embly; and the nobles and clergy who had been aver&s;e to the junction of the orders, now intriguing, every debate became a bitter or violent conte&s;t, in which the popular advocates continued to gain an a&s;cendency.</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition to intrigue, and want of &s;in|cerity, &s;o generally remarked in the French cha|racter, laid the foundation of univer&s;al di&s;tru&s;t; and the coale&s;ced parties, who had not been actuated by a love of liberty, or regard for the pro&s;perity of the kingdom, but dexterou&s;ly fell in with the &s;pirit of the day, were not aware, that a watchful, &s;u&s;picious multitude, would be as likely to mi&s;tru&s;t them in their turn, as the court, which had thriven on the ruin of their happine&s;s. This was a blindne&s;s &s;o gro&s;s, that it appears not a little wonderful, after con&s;idering the different characters, who &s;ucceeded each other in the mini&s;try, or directed the helm of the &s;tate, that men &s;hould not acquire &s;ufficient judgment to adopt the integrity of conduct, with which alone people in their &s;en&s;es, awake to their intere&s;t and rights, will ever be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>For a vain glorious ambition, mixing with the abortions of giddy patrioti&s;m, acts as the mo&s;t fatal poi&s;on to political di&s;qui&s;itions, during &s;ea|&s;ons of public ferment. The &s;olid views of deep

thinkers are adapted to the &s;pirit of the times, and the &s;tate of rea&s;on of their compeers. And if they find that the current of opinion, in over|turning inveterate prejudices, and the decayed walls of laws, that no longer &s;uit the manners, threatens the de&s;truction of principles the mo&s;t &s;acred; they ought firmly to wait at their po&s;t, until, the fervor abating, they could, by divert|ing the &s;tream, gradually re&s;train it within pro|per bounds.&mdash;But &s;uch patrioti&s;m is of &s;low growth; requiring both a luxuriant public &s;oil, and to be fo&s;tered by virtuous emulation. Yet this emulation will never flouri&s;h in a country where intriguing fine&s;&s;e, &s;upplying the place of exalted merit, is the &s;ure&s;t ladder to di&s;tinction. It was by deba&s;ing artifices, under the old go|vernment that men obtained favour and con&s;e|quence; and while &s;uch men, men who were educated and o&s;&s;ified by the ancient <HI>regimen,</HI> act on the political &s;tage of France, mankind will be continually di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and amu&s;ed by their tragic and comic exhibitions.</P>

The &s;agacious part of the nation, it is true, clearly perceived, that the period was arrived, when a revolution was inevitable; but &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s being incompatible with noble, comprehen&s;ive, or lau|dable views, it is not wonderful, keeping in &s;ight

the national foible, that at the meeting of the &s;tates-general every deputy had his particular plan to &s;ugge&s;t. Few of the leaders embraced the &s;ame; and acting, without coale&s;cing, the mo&s;t violent mea&s;ures were &s;ure to be the mo&s;t applauded. We &s;hall find al&s;o, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;trenuous advocates for reforming abu&s;es, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a con&s;titution, when their fa|vourite &s;y&s;tems were exploded peevi&s;hly retired in di&s;gu&s;t: and by afterwards venting it, have hurried into action a race of mon&s;ters, the mo&s;t flagitious that ever alarmed the world by the murder of innocents, and the mockery of ju&s;tice; and whil&s;t the profanation of her temple, be|&s;prinkled with blood, has branded with an inde|lible &s;tigma the &s;anguinary brutes, the de&s;erters cannot e&s;cape without a &s;hare of the odium.</P>
<P>Contemplating the progre&s;s of the revolution, a melancholy reflection is produced by ob&s;erv|ing, that almo&s;t every precipitate event has been the con&s;equence of a tenacity and littlene&s;s of mind in the political actors, whil&s;t they were affecting a Roman magnanimity of conduct&mdash;to which they appear to have been as great &s;tran|gers, as they were de&s;titute of legitimate patri|oti&s;m, and political &s;cience.</P>

no better light, when their plans were di&s;regarded, if not acting the &s;ame &s;hameful part, yet leaving their po&s;ts; their patrioti&s;m expiring with their popularity.&mdash;And it will be only nece&s;&s;ary to keep in mind the conduct of all the leading men, who have been active in the revolution, to perceive, that the di&s;a&s;ters of the nation have ari&s;en from the &s;ame mi&s;erable &s;ource of vanity, and the wretched &s;truggles of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; when the cri&s;is required, that all enlightened patriots &s;hould have united and formed a band, to have con&s;o|lidated the great work; the commencement of which they had accelerated. In proportion as the&s;e de&s;ertions have taken place, the be&s;t abilities which the country contained have di&s;appeared. And thus it has happened, that ignorance and audacity have triumphed, merely becau&s;e there were not found tho&s;e brilliant talents, which, pur&s;uing the &s;traight forward line of political economy, arre&s;t, as it were, the &s;uffrage of every well di&s;po&s;ed citizen &mdash;Such talents exi&s;ted in France: and had they combined, and directed their views by a pure love of their country, to one point; all the di&s;a&s;ters, which in overwhelm|ing the empire have de&s;troyed the repo&s;e of Europe, would not have occurred to di&s;grace the cau&s;e of freedom.</P>
<P>Every great reform requires &s;y&s;tematic manage|ment; and however lightly weak daring heads may treat the gravity of &s;uch a remark, the pacific progre&s;s of every revolution will depend, in a very material degree, on the moderation and reciprocity of conce&s;&s;ions made by the acting parties.

It was peculiarly urgent, indeed, to form &s;uch a coalition, to counteract the dangerous con&s;equences of old prejudices. The &s;tubborn habits of men, whom per&s;onal intere&s;t kept firm to their ground, it was morally certain would interrupt the tranquil march of the revolution: it would have been pru|dent then for men, who agreed in the main ob|jects to have overlooked trifling differences of opinion, till they were &s;ecured: and of this &s;everal members &s;eem to have been aware.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lally-Tolendal, in particular; for giving his opinion on the &s;ubject of two chambers, he &s;aid:&mdash;

But re&s;entment bur&s;ting forth, which had long lain concealed (the effect of &s;ervitude and contumely), joined with the vanity of excelling all other nations in the &s;cience of government, to produce an in&s;olent audacity of conduct, which, aiming at overturn|ing every thing, di&s;couraged the wavering, and frightened the timid. De&s;igning knaves then conceived the plan of ri&s;ing to eminence by the accumulating foibles of the multitude, who, loo&s;ened from all re&s;traint, were ea&s;ily caught by the infidious arts of the mo&s;t contemptible anarchi&s;ts.</P>

<P>THE numerous offerings made to their country by the deputies, on the 4th of Augu&s;t, excited loud applau&s;e; but not without a mix|ture of &s;arca&s;tic cen&s;ure, and murmurs of di&s;|approbation.</P>
<P>Some blamed the decrees, which, &s;aid they, have &s;acrificed the property of &s;everal thou&s;and fami|lies

to the vain de&s;ire of popularity.&mdash;Others complained of the neglect of tho&s;e forms, by which every a&s;&s;embly, that a&s;pires at putting &s;ome maturity into its decrees, ought to direct debates;&mdash;they di&s;approved of an afternoon &s;it|ting;&mdash;of the rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ubjects, not allowing time for any to be weighed;&mdash;of the multiplicity of them;&mdash;and of the continual accla|mations, which rendered a calm di&s;cu&s;&s;ion phy|&s;ically impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;'What!' they continued, &s;hall
<Q>the mo&s;t important bu&s;ine&s;s always be treated with the levity, which characterized us before we de&s;erved to be termed a nation? Eternally the &s;port of our vivacity, a happy turn decides with us the mo&s;t &s;erious point; and gay &s;al|lies are ever our &s;ub&s;titutes for arguments.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>We do madly the wi&s;e&s;t things; and even our rea&s;on is always connected by &s;ome filament or other to incon&s;i&s;tency.&mdash;The national a&s;&s;em|bly had been a long time reproached for dwell|ing on trifling objects; and not attending &s;uf|ficiently to the promotion of general good.&mdash; When &s;uddenly&mdash;in a &s;ingle night, more than twenty important laws are decided by an up|roar. So much done, in &s;uch a &s;hort time, is &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, that it appears like a dream.</Q></P>
<P>In reply it was &s;aid&mdash;
<Q>Why deliberate, when all are agreed?&mdash;Does not a general good always appear &s;elf-evident?&mdash;Was it not &s;uffi|cient to declare the&s;e patriotic propo&s;itions to prove their ju&s;tne&s;s?&mdash;The fir&s;t per&s;on, who pointed out a new tribute to the public intere&s;t only gave utterance to what we all before felt&mdash; there was no need then of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion or elo|quence, to make that be adopted, which had
<PB N="231" REF="029916_0240_0FE30BC50909B0B0">
already been re&s;olved by the greater num|ber of the deputies, and commanded by the awful authority of the nation, in their mandates.&mdash;The a&s;&s;embly might have pro|ceeded more methodically; but the re&s;ult could not have been more advantageous. It &s;eemed as if all the old effects, all the moul|dering titles of feudal oppre&s;&s;ions were then put up to auction: and the kind of mi&s;tru&s;t of the different orders, which provoked re|ciprocal conce&s;&s;ions, was &s;till for the public good.</Q></P>
<P>The nobles and clergy of the provinces, who had not been carried away by the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the 4th of Augu&s;t, felt them&s;elves particularly aggrieved. Tho&s;e who were recently noble did not like to mix again on equal terms in towns where they had received the homage paid to princes; and the people, eager to exerci&s;e their liberty, began to hunt down the game, regardle&s;s of the mi&s;chief they did to the &s;tanding corn. The very conce&s;&s;ions of the nobility &s;eemed to rou&s;e the vengeance it ought to have allayed; and the populace vented their rage by burning the ca&s;tles, which had been, as it were, legally di&s;mantled of their feudal fortifications.</P>
<P>The clergy, in particular, complained, that their deputies had exceeded all bounds in voting away the private property of the body; for they would not allow, that tithes came within the de&s;cription of feudal tenures. The want of pro|vi&s;ion, likewi&s;e, tended to make the people cla|mour about pre&s;ent grievances, without &s;uffering the pro&s;pect of future comfort and re&s;pectability to have its due force towards calming their minds.
<PB N="232" REF="029916_0241_0FE30B3693469200">
All, therefore, flew to arms, and three millions of men wearing the military garb, &s;howed the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the nation; and their pre|&s;ent re&s;olve, no longer to couch &s;upinely under oppre&s;&s;ion. Many exce&s;&s;es were the con&s;equence of this &s;udden change; and it is notorious, that the people, in &s;ome in&s;tances, became the in&s;tru|ments of the routed party; who continued to u&s;e every &s;tratagem to render the nation di&s;&s;atis|fied with the revolution.</P>
<P>It is the nature of man, either in a &s;avage &s;tate or living in &s;ociety, to protect his property; and it is wi&s;e in a government to encourage this &s;pirit. For the example now di&s;played by France is a notable proof of the inexpediency of &s;tanding armies, &s;o long as the people have an intere&s;t in &s;upporting the political &s;y&s;tem under which they live. The national a&s;&s;embly, aware of this, in|vited the militia and the municipalities, to endea|vour to quell the di&s;orders, which did violence to per&s;ons and property; and they were particu|larly reque&s;ted to take the mo&s;t watchful care, that the convoys of wheat and flour were not &s;topped by the idle and lawle&s;s. For &s;everal of the mo&s;t fatal tumults had originated from this cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The decrees of the 4th of Augu&s;t, were then brought forward to be examined and explained; and &s;ome attempts were made to argue away the e&s;&s;ence of many of the vaunted &s;acrifices.&mdash;But the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion was interrupted, to attend to bu&s;i|ne&s;s of a more pre&s;&s;ing nature. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nation was mo&s;t alarming; and the mini&s;ters, not knowing how to act under the new trammels of re&s;pon&s;ibility, came to repre|&s;ent
<PB N="233" REF="029916_0242_0FE30BCD76183C70">
to the a&s;&s;embly;&mdash;that the laws were with|out force;&mdash;the courts of ju&s;tice without activity; &mdash;and they reque&s;ted them, immediately to point out the coercive mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to give to the executive authority the influence it had lo&s;t. &mdash;'For' ob&s;erved they,
<Q>whether the irritated &s;en&s;e of the abu&s;es, which the king wi&s;hes to reform, and you de&s;ire to pro&s;cribe for ever, have led the people a&s;tray; or, the declaration of an univer&s;al regeneration have &s;haken the various powers upon which the &s;ocial order repo&s;ed&mdash;or whatever, in fact, be the cau&s;e, gentlemen, the truth is, that public order and tranquillity are di&s;turbed in almo&s;t every part of the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>Necker, afterwards, having explained the de|plorable &s;tate of the finances, the extraordinary expences, and the diminution in the produce of the revenue, demanded, in the name of the king, that the a&s;&s;embly would &s;anction a loan of thirty millions of livres, to fulfil the engagements, and di&s;charge the inevitable expenditure of the two approaching months; by which time, he pre|&s;umed, the con&s;titution would be nearly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. Thinking al&s;o, that the patrioti&s;m of money-lenders was not to be reckoned upon, he propo&s;ed to add to the five per cent. he mentioned &s;ome allurements of &s;peculation, to quicken the determination of the lenders&mdash; and he further inferred, that private intere&s;t would then tend to quiet the kingdom, whil&s;t they were advancing in the formation of a con&s;titution, which was to &s;ecure its future tranquillity, and provide a permanent revenue.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="029916_0243_0FE30C11ED1BF940">This propo&s;al produced the mo&s;t warm and loud applau&s;e.&mdash;One member propo&s;ed, that the loan &s;hould in&s;tantly be voted in the pre&s;ence of the mini&s;ter, as a mark of their entire &s;atisfac|tion&mdash;another offered &s;ix hundred thou&s;and livres as a &s;ecurity that he would rai&s;e the loan in his own province. This efferve&s;cence, &s;o contagious, which is after all only phy&s;ical &s;en&s;ibility, excited by a commotion of the animal &s;pirits, proves, that a con&s;iderable length of time is nece&s;&s;ary to accu&s;tom men to exerci&s;e their rights with deli|beration; that they may be able to defend them|&s;elves from a kind of in&s;tinctive confidence in men; and to make them &s;ub&s;titute re&s;pect for principles, to a blind faith in per&s;ons, even of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities.&mdash;But to elevate a numerous a&s;&s;embly to this calm grandeur; to that permanent dignity, which repre&s;&s;es the emo|tions of the moment, demands, it is probable, a more advanced &s;tate of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Lally Tolendal &s;upported the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed for the obtain|ing a loan to &s;upply the exigencies of govern|ment, which were become very urgent; and he refuted the objection, made by &s;everal deputies, who were again&s;t the grant, that in their in&s;truc|tions they had been &s;trictly enjoined not to &s;anc|tion any tax or loan before the con&s;titution was formed. On this &s;ide Mirabeau ranged him&s;elf; for with all his great talents and &s;uperiority of genius, he could not avoid envying inferior abi|lities, when they attracted the lea&s;t popularity. He therefore, with plau&s;ible rhetoric but &s;hallow arguments, oppo&s;ed the loan; and with great parade moved, that the deputies &s;hould offer
<PB N="235" REF="029916_0244_0FE30BCF73171230">
their individual credit, in&s;tead of departing from the very letter of their in&s;tructions. This was one of tho&s;e in&s;tances of pretended di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s, or fal&s;e patrioti&s;m, calculated to dazzle the people, whil&s;t it involved the nation in fre&s;h embarra&s;&s;ments.</P>
<P>The plan was referred to the con&s;ideration of the committee appointed to make financial re|ports: and they accordingly acknowledged the nece&s;&s;ity of a prompt &s;upply; but thought, that the loan might now be obtained without the additional advantages which Necker mentioned as a nece&s;&s;ary bait. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion was then re|newed with great heat, and even per&s;onality; till at la&s;t the intere&s;t of the loan was fixed at four and an half per cent.; and to &s;lip through the knot they were afraid to cut, it was to be &s;anctioned under the wing of the decrees of the 4th of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>It did not, however, prove productive; for in the cour&s;e of three weeks, only two millions, &s;ix hundred thou&s;and livres were &s;ub&s;cribed. And this delay of bu&s;ine&s;s induced the a&s;&s;embly to adopt, with le&s;s &s;cruple, another propo&s;al for a fre&s;h loan, in&s;tead of the one that did not pro|mi&s;e to an&s;wer, at a rate le&s;s advantageous to the nation: or rather they yielded to the nece&s;&s;ity, into which they had plunged them&s;elves; and left the mode of obtaining it to the executive power, in &s;pite of their former objection. But it was not an ea&s;y ta&s;k to in&s;pire the bankers and money-holders with &s;ufficient faith in the new government, to induce them to come for|ward to &s;upport it; be&s;ides, the previous di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion had converted caution into timidity; and
<PB N="236" REF="029916_0245_0FE30B2AF27F2B78">
the more de&s;perate the &s;tate of the finances ap|peared, the &s;tronger grew the &s;u&s;picion, that threw in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles in the way of a temporary relief.</P>
<P>Settling the preci&s;e terms of the decrees, which were to aboli&s;h feudal va&s;&s;alage, the que&s;tion re&s;pecting the including of tithes was agitated with mo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s; and the objections urged again&s;t the abolition were not only ingenious, but rea&s;onable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It is worthy of remark, that the <HI>divine right</HI> of tithes was never in&s;i&s;ted on,</Q>
&s;ays a French writer,
<Q>even by the clergy, during this debate. Yet the year before, when the &s;ame que&s;tion was brought forward in the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of parliament, great &s;tre&s;s was laid on this Gothic idea of their origin.</Q></NOTE> The abb&eacute; Sieyes &s;poke with great good &s;en&s;e, a&s;&s;erting,
<Q>that the tithes were not a tax levied on the nation; but a rent|charge, for which a proper allowance had been made to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the e&s;tates, to not one of whom they actually belonged. He, therefore, in&s;i&s;ted, that, if the &s;acrifice were nece&s;&s;ary, it ought to be made to the public, to relieve the people, and not to enrich the pro|prietors; who were, generally &s;peaking, of the mo&s;t opulent part of the community.</Q>
He advi&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly to be on their guard, le&s;t avarice, under the ma&s;k of zeal, &s;hould deceive them, leading the nation to reward rather than indemnify the nobility. The fact was, that the landed intere&s;t were only re&s;igning ob&s;olete pri|vileges, which they &s;carcely dared exerci&s;e, to &s;ecure a &s;olid advantage. Society has hitherto been con&s;tructed in &s;uch a vicious manner, that to relieve the poor you mu&s;t benefit the rich.
<PB N="237" REF="029916_0246_0FE30BD0F6BC7768">
The pre&s;ent &s;ubject was a delicate one; the abo|lition of tithes would remove a very heavy vex|atious clog, that had long hung on the neck of indu&s;try; yet it were to be wi&s;hed, that it could have been &s;ettled in &s;uch a way as not to have &s;ecured a great pecuniary advantage to the nobi|lity. For though it was phy&s;ically impo&s;&s;ible, to make this &s;acrifice to &s;ociety at large immedi|ately; becau&s;e the proprietors, and more parti|cularly the lea&s;e-holders of the e&s;tates, could not have redeemed the tithes, without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to a degree, that would nearly have &s;topped the cour&s;e of hu&s;bandry; not to men|tion agricultural improvements, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in France, and to be looked for as the fruit of liberty:&mdash;yet a gradual tax on the original land|lord would have prevented the nobility from being the great gainers by their &s;o much extolled di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, in their fallacious &s;acrifice of privileges. Becau&s;e, for all real property they were to be reimbur&s;ed; and for the obnoxious feudal tenures, &s;uch as per&s;onal &s;ervitude, with others they were a&s;hamed to enumerate as being due from man to man, the tithes were an ample indemnity; or more properly &s;peaking clear pro|fit, except to tho&s;e who parted with the plumes which rai&s;ed them above their fellows with great regret. It was, indeed, very difficult to &s;eparate the evil from the good that would redound to the nation by the doing away of this tax.&mdash;The clergy, however, cut the debate &s;hort, by re&s;ign|ing their right, offering to tru&s;t to the ju&s;tice of the public for the &s;tipend in return nece&s;&s;ary to enable them to &s;upport the dignity of their function.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="029916_0247_0FE30C136FD78730">On the 13th, therefore, the whole di&s;cu&s;&s;ion clo&s;ed; for the other articles did not admit of much di&s;putation.

<P>A committee of five had been employed to di|ge&s;t a declaration of rights, to precede the con|&s;titution. The opinion of tho&s;e, who thought that this declaration ought to have been kept back, has already been alluded to; yet the &s;ub|ject &s;eems to require a little further con&s;ideration. And, perhaps, it will appear ju&s;t to &s;eparate the character of the philo&s;opher, who dedicates his exertions to promote the welfare, and perfection of mankind, carrying his views beyond any time he choo&s;es to mark; from that of the politician, who&s;e duty it is to attend to the improvement and intere&s;t of the time in which he lives, and not &s;acrifice any pre&s;ent comfort to a pro&s;pect of future perfection or happine&s;s. If this defini|tion be ju&s;t, the philo&s;opher naturally becomes a pa&s;&s;ive, the politician an active character. For though the de&s;ire of loudly proclaiming the grand principles of liberty to extend them quick|ly, be one of the mo&s;t powerful a benevolent man, of every de&s;cription of mind, feels; he no &s;ooner wi&s;hes to obey this impul&s;e, than he finds him&s;elf placed between two rocks.&mdash;Truth commands him to &s;ay all; wi&s;dom whi&s;pers to him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emporize.&mdash;A love of ju&s;tice would lead

<P>The debates re&s;pecting the adoption of the declaration of rights became very &s;pirited; and much heterogeneous matter was introduced, to lengthen the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and heat the di&s;putants, as the different articles were reviewed. The article re&s;pecting religion particularly arre&s;ted the atten|tion of the a&s;&s;embly, and produced one of tho&s;e tumultuous &s;cenes, which have &s;o often di&s;graced their deliberations. The intolerant &s;entiments uttered; and even the in&s;ertion of &s;ome amend|ments, which could not, without a contradiction in terms, find a place in a declaration of rights; proved, that the a&s;&s;embly contained a majority, who were &s;till governed by prejudices inimical to the full extent of that liberty, which is the un|alienable right of each citizen, when it does not infringe on the equal enjoyment of the &s;ame por|tion by his neighbour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the artcile 10.

And as the &s;lighte&s;t contradiction &s;ets them on fire, three parts out of four of the time, which ought to have been employed in &s;erious inve&s;tiga|tion, was con&s;umed in idle vehemence. Whil&s;t the applau&s;es and hi&s;&s;es of the galleries increa&s;ed the tumult; making the vain &s;till more eager to mount the &s;tage. Thus every thing contributing to excite the emotions, which lead men only to court admiration, the good of the people was too often &s;acrificed to the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing them. And &s;o completely was the tide of their affection for the king turned, that they &s;eemed aver&s;e to his having any portion of legi&s;lative authority in the new con&s;titution.</P>

to exerci&s;e the faculty of acting; or, the executive power.</Q></P>
<P>He further in&s;i&s;ts, that
<Q>the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this power is the only way to render a king u&s;eful, and to enable him to act as a check on the legi&s;|lative body: the majority of which might ty|rannize i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mo&s;t de&s;potic manner, even in the &s;enate, to the very expul&s;ion of the members, who dared to thwart the mea&s;ures they could not approve. For under a weak prince, a little time and addre&s;s alone would be nece&s;&s;ary, to e&s;tabli&s;h legally the dominion of an army of ari&s;tocrats; who, making the royal authority only the pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument of their will, might replunge the people into their old &s;tate of de|ba&s;ement.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The prince, therefore, being the perpetual repre&s;entative of the people, as the deputies are their repre&s;entatives elected at certain pe|riods, is equally their &s;afe-guard.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No per&s;on exclaims again&s;t the <HI>veto</HI> of the national a&s;&s;embly; which is, in reality, only a right the people have confided in their repre|&s;entatives, to oppo&s;e every propo&s;ition, that would tend to re-e&s;tabli&s;h mini&s;terial de&s;poti&s;m. Why then object to the <HI>veto</HI> of the prince, which is but another right, e&s;pecially confided in him by the people, becau&s;e he and they are equally intere&s;ted to prevent the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an ari&s;tocracy?</Q></P>
<P>He proceeds to prove,
<Q>that, whil&s;t the legi&s;|lative body is re&s;pectable, the <HI>veto</HI> of the king cannot do harm, though it is a &s;alutary check on their deliberations; and granting, that the influence of the crown has a tendency to increa&s;e,
<PB N="245" REF="029916_0254_0FE30BDB20318420">
a permanent a&s;&s;embly would be a &s;ufficient counterpoi&s;e for the royal negative. Let us,</Q>

<Q>have an annual national a&s;&s;embly, let mini&s;ters be made re&s;pon&s;ible; and the royal &s;anction without any &s;pecified re&s;trictions, but in fact, perfectly limited, will be the palladium of national liberty, and the mo&s;t precious exer|ci&s;e of the liberty of the people.</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;uffered by the abu&s;e of ab&s;olute power, many of the deputies, afraid to entru&s;t their con|&s;titutional monarchs with any, oppo&s;ed the <HI>veto;</HI> le&s;t it &s;hould pal&s;y the operations of the national a&s;&s;embly, and bring back the old de&s;poti&s;m of the cabinet. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion likewi&s;e extending be|yond it's walls, was as &s;uperficially and as warmly treated by tho&s;e, who thought only of the old government, when they talked of framing a new one. And as the people were now led by hot|headed men, who found it the &s;horte&s;t way to popularity, to deliver exaggerated elogiums on liberty, they began to look for a degree of free|dom in their government, incompatible with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of their manners; and of which they had no perfect idea.

<P>But, from the commencement of the revolu|tion, the mi&s;ery of France has originated from the &s;olly or art of men, who have purred the people on too fa&s;t; tearing up prejudices by the root&punc; which they &s;hould have permitted to die gradually away.

<P>Could it, indeed, have been a&s;certained, that Louis, or rather the queen, would have tamely born with &s;uch a diminution of power, this mea|&s;ure might have been deemed prudent; becau&s;e it was then morally certain, that the monarchy would have expired naturally with the di&s;&s;olution of the king. But, when the pride and re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of the queen were well known; and that it was probable, from the whole tenor of her former life, &s;he would contrive to have the mini&s;try compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute and head|&s;trong men; it mu&s;t appear the height of folly only to have left the king the power of perplexing their proceedings, after they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">qued his pride. And when, to give, as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, efficiency to the con&s;piracies, which would naturally be formed by the courtiers, to recover the authority <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ft from them, we find they afterwards voted &s;uch an enormous &s;um to defray the civil li&s;t, as was &s;ufficient to move like puppets hundreds of the corrupt French; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that their ab&s;urdity and want of di&s;cernment appear not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> reprehen&s;ible, than the &s;ub&s;equent con|duct of the court flagitious.</P>

&s;ee that the con&s;titution was accepted, not &s;anc|tioned. This report carries with it an air of imbecility, which renders it almo&s;t incredible: for, if the a&s;&s;embly were determined to oblige the king to accept their decrees, they had better have told him &s;o with becoming dignity, and made pro|vi&s;ion for his retiring from a po&s;t in which he was u&s;ele&s;s.

<P>There were be&s;ides many circum&s;tances, which tended to make any attempt to counteract this influence very difficult.

And to &s;hew previou&s;ly their en|tire di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, as well as fear of allowing the exerci&s;e of power to become familiar, much le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to any members of the community, they unanimou&s;ly voted, that for each legi&s;lature,

the name given to the meeting of the repre&s;enta|tives, a total change of the deputies &s;hould take place.</P>
<P>The very nobility, in fact, were far from be|ing united in &s;upport of two chambers. The order was a numerous one: and to e&s;tabli&s;h an equality of privileges, it was nece&s;&s;ary, that they &s;hould all concur to elect the upper chamber, as the repre&s;entatives of the whole body; whil&s;t the nobles of the court, and of the ancient hou&s;es, &s;ecretly indulged the hope of e&s;tabli&s;hing a peerage; which would not only rai&s;e them above the commons, but keep at a proper di&s;|tance the up&s;tart nobility, with whom they had heretofore impatiently jo&s;tled. There was even another cau&s;e of jealou&s;y: for it was pre&s;umed, that the forty-&s;even nobles, who fir&s;t joined the a&s;&s;embly, would now be rewarded. In &s;hort, the idle fears and more contemptible vanity of the different parties now operated &s;o much in favour of an indivi&s;ible &s;enate, that the que&s;tion was decided by a great majority, to the entire &s;atisfaction of the public, who were almo&s;t as eager for one chamber, as aver&s;e to the <HI>veto.</HI></P>
<P>The deputies, who oppo&s;ed the upper chamber to promote the good of &s;ociety, did it from a belief, that it would be the a&s;ylum of a new ari&s;tocracy; and from a total ignorance, or ob|&s;curity of ideas, re&s;pecting its utility. Whil&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ions of the feudal &s;y&s;tem being &s;till pre|&s;ent to the minds of the people, they con&s;idered a divi&s;ion of the legi&s;lative body as incon&s;i&s;tent with the freedom and equality they were taught to expect as the prime ble&s;&s;ings of a new con|&s;titution. The very mention of <HI>two chambers</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="029916_0265_0FE30C29C7FB7118">
carried them back to the old di&s;pute, re&s;pecting the negative of the different orders; and &s;eemed to &s;ubvert the revolution. Such fears, degene|rating into weakne&s;s, can only be accounted for by recollecting the many cruel thraldoms, from which they had &s;o recently e&s;caped. Be&s;ides, the remembrance of their former &s;ervitude, and the re&s;entment excited by the late &s;truggle to prove they were men, created in their enthu&s;ia&s;tic imaginations &s;uch a multitude of horrors, and fanta&s;tic images of new dangers, as did not al|low them to exerci&s;e the full powers of their rea&s;on. So that to convince them of the pro|priety of a new in&s;titution, and heat the &s;upport|ers of it, nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary, than to &s;how that it was the very rever&s;e of tho&s;e main|tained by the partizans of the old government.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of giving to the executive part of a government an ab&s;olute <HI>veto</HI> might very ju&s;tly have been que&s;tioned; as it &s;eems to be giving a power to one man to counteract the will of a whole people&mdash;an ab&s;urdity too gro&s;s to merit refutation. Still, whil&s;t crowns are a nece&s;&s;ary bauble to plea&s;e the multitude, it is al&s;o nece&s;|&s;ary, that their dignity &s;hould be &s;upported, in order to prevent an overweening ari&s;tocracy from concentrating all authority in them&s;elves. This &s;eems to have been expedient, likewi&s;e, as long as the manners of barbarians remained: as &s;avages are naturally plea&s;ed with gla&s;s and beads, in proportion as they afford a &s;triking contra&s;t to the rude materials of their own fa|brication.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;&s;ive influence of knowledge on manners, both dre&s;s and governments appear to

be acquiring &s;implicity; it may therefore be in|ferred, that as the people attain dignity of cha|racter, their amu&s;ements will flow from a more rational &s;ource than the pageantry of kings, or the view of the fopperies exhibited at courts. If the&s;e have been &s;upported hitherto by childi&s;h ignorance, they &s;eem to be lo&s;ing their influence, as the under&s;tanding of the world approaches to manhood: for, as they grow wi&s;er, the people will look for the &s;olid advantages of &s;ociety; and watching wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ufficient vigilance their own intere&s;t, the <HI>veto</HI> of the executive branch of the government would become perfectly u&s;ele&s;s; though in the hands of an unprincipled, bold chief magi&s;trate, it might prove a dangerous in|&s;trument. In forming repre&s;entative plan of government it appears nece&s;&s;ary then to take care only, that it be &s;o con&s;tructed, as to prevent ha&s;ty deci&s;ions; or the carrying into laws dan|gerous&punc; impolitic mea&s;ures, which have been ur|ged by popular decla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, who are too apt to gain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;cendancy in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> numerous a&s;&s;embly. Until the principles of governments become &s;implified, and a knowledge of them be di&s;&s;eminated, it is to be fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, that popular a&s;&s;emblies will often be infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nced by the fa&s;cinating charms of eloquence: and as it is po&s;&s;ible for a man to be eloquent without being either wi&s;e or virtuous, it is but a common precaution of prudence in the framers of a con&s;titution, to provide &s;ome check to the evil.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is very probable, in the &s;ame &s;tate of rea&s;on, that a faction may ari&s;e, which will controul the a&s;&s;embly; and, acting contrary to the dictates of wi&s;dom, throw the &s;tate into the
<PB N="258" REF="029916_0267_0FE30B38354FCBF0">
mo&s;t dangerous convul&s;ions of anarchy; con&s;e|quently, it ought to form a primary object with a con&s;tituting a&s;&s;embly, to prevent, by &s;ome &s;alu|tary contrivance, the mi&s;chief flowing from &s;uch &s;ources. The obvious preventative is a &s;econd chamber, or &s;enate, which would not, it is mo&s;t likely, be under the influence of the &s;ame faction; and it is at lea&s;t certain, that its deci&s;ions would not be directed by the &s;ame orators. The advan|tage would be more certain if bu&s;ine&s;s were not conducted in the two chambers in a &s;imilar man|ner. Thus by making the mo&s;t numerous a&s;&s;em|bly the mo&s;t active, the other would have more time to weigh the probable con&s;equence of any act or decree, which would prevent tho&s;e incon|veniences; or, at lea&s;t, many of them, the con&s;e|quence of ha&s;te or faction.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem in an old government is &s;u&s;|ceptible of improvement. The minds of young men generally having more fire, activity, and in|vention, it would be politically wi&s;e to re&s;trict the age of the &s;enators to thirty-five, or forty years; at which period of life they mo&s;t likely would have gone through a certain routine of bu&s;ine&s;s; and become more &s;age and &s;teady, they would be better calculated to decide re&s;pecting the policy, or wi&s;dom of the acts of the chamber of repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>It is true, France was in &s;uch a &s;tate at the time of the revolution, that a like improvement could not have been in&s;tantly carried into execu|tion, becau&s;e the ari&s;tocratical influence was ju&s;t|ly to be dreaded. The con&s;tituting a&s;&s;embly then &s;hould have remained indivi&s;ible; and as the members became in &s;ome mea&s;ure acquainted

with legi&s;lative bu&s;ine&s;s, they would have pre|pared &s;enators for the upper chamber. All the fu|ture legi&s;latures being divided into two chambers, a hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and a &s;enate, the mem|bers of the national a&s;&s;embly might have been permitted to be elected for the &s;enate, though they &s;hould not have attained the age pre&s;cribed; for the re&s;triction needed not to have taken place until the government found its level, and even then, the members of the preceding hou&s;e of re|pre&s;entatives might have been allowed to be re|turned for the &s;enate.</P>
<P>It has been a common remark of morali&s;ts, that we are the lea&s;t acquainted with our own characters. This has been literally the ca&s;e with the French: for certainly no people &s;tand in &s;uch great need of a check; and, totally de&s;ti|tute of experience in political &s;cience, it mu&s;t have been clear to all men of &s;ound under&s;tand|ing, that &s;ome &s;uch plan alone would have ena|bled them to avoid many fatal errors.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t efforts of the national a&s;&s;embly were truly magnanimous; but the character of the men was too light, to maintain the &s;ame hero|i&s;m, when not warmed by pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;too giddy, to &s;upport with grave dignity the &s;plendor of &s;ud|den glory. Their vanity was al&s;o unbounded; and their fal&s;e e&s;timate of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of conduct, whil&s;t they betrayed puerility of &s;enti|ment, was not among the lea&s;t of the misfor|tunes, which have befallen that unhappy country. Their hearts had been too long &s;ophi&s;ticated, to &s;ugge&s;t the be&s;t mode of communicating free|dom to millions; and their heads were &s;till le&s;s calculated to lay down a practicable plan of go|vernment,

For when the members of a &s;tate are not direct|ed by practical knowledge, every one produces a plan of polity, till the confu&s;ion becomes general, and the nation plunges into wretchedne&s;s, pur|&s;uing the &s;chemes of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers of genius, who, advancing before their age, have &s;ketched the model of a perfect &s;y&s;tem of government. Thus it happened in France, that Hume's idea of a perfect commonwealth, the adoption of which would be eligible only when civilization has arrived at a much greater degree of perfec|tion, and knowledge is more generally diffu&s;ed than at the pre&s;ent period, was neverthele&s;s cho|&s;en as the model of their new government, with a few exceptions, by the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly: which choice doubtle&s;s proceeded from the mem|bers

not having had an opportunity to acquire a knowledge of practical liberty.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the national a&s;&s;embly had deter|mined, that the legi&s;lative body &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of one hou&s;e, to be renewed every two years, they appear to have had &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of the impolicy of the decree; but not allowing them&s;elves time to comprehend the u&s;e of a &s;enate taken from the body of the people, they attempted to &s;ilence the fears, &s;ome moderate men entertained, of the bad con&s;equences which might ari&s;e from the deci|&s;ions of an impetuous a&s;&s;embly without a check, by a&s;&s;uring them, that the delay, the <HI>veto</HI> would occa&s;ion, was a &s;ufficient counterpoi&s;e. They repre&s;ented the king's <HI>veto</HI> as the negative arche|type of the national will; adding, that it would be the duty of the &s;overeign to examine with vigilance the ju&s;tice or wi&s;dom of their decrees; and by the exertion of his power prevent the ha&s;ty e&s;tabli&s;hment of any laws inimical to the
<PB N="263" REF="029916_0272_0FE30BF8299297E8">
public good. So ea&s;y is it for men to frame arguments to cover the homely features of their own folly&mdash;&s;o dangerous is it to follow a refined theory, however fea&s;ible it may appear, when the happine&s;s of an empire depends on its &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;o incon&s;iderately did the national a&s;&s;embly act in this great bu&s;ine&s;s, that they did not wait even to determine the preci&s;e meaning of the word <HI>&s;anction.</HI></P>
<P>If the king then repre&s;ented the negative will of the nation, which the a&s;&s;embly pretended to &s;ay he did; and if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;upreme wi&s;dom and moderation nece&s;&s;ary to guaranty that will, which &s;uppo&s;ing he did not, it was a folly too gro&s;s to require any comment; in the name of common &s;en&s;e&mdash;why was his <HI>veto &s;u&s;pen&s;ive?</HI></P>
<P>The truth is obvious,&mdash;the a&s;&s;embly had not &s;ufficient courage to take a decided part.&mdash;They knew, that the king and court could not be de|pended upon; yet they had not the magnanimity to give them up altogether. They ju&s;tly dreaded the depravity and influence of the nobles; but they had not the &s;agacity to model the govern|ment in &s;uch a manner, as would have defeated their future con&s;piracies, and rendered their power nugatory; though they had the example of the Thirteen States of America before them, from which they had drawn what little practical knowledge of liberty they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. &mdash;But, no; the regeneration of France mu&s;t lead to the re|generation of the whole globe. The political &s;y&s;tem of Frenchmen mu&s;t &s;erve as a model for all the free &s;tates in the univer&s;e!&mdash;<HI>Vive la libert&eacute;</HI>
<PB N="264" REF="029916_0273_0FE30C33745EAD60">
&mdash;was the only cry&mdash;and <HI>la bagatelle</HI> entered into every debate&mdash;whil&s;t the whole nation, wild with joy, was hailing the commencement of the golden age.</P>
<P>The women too, not to be outdone by the Roman dames, came forward, during this di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, to &s;acrifice their ornaments for the good of their country. And this fre&s;h example of public &s;pirit was al&s;o given by the third e&s;tate; for they were the wives and daughters of artizans, who fir&s;t renounced their female pride&mdash;or rather made one kind of vanity take place of another. However, the offering was made with theatrical grace; and the lively applau&s;es of the a&s;&s;embly were reiterated with great gallantry.</P>
<P>Another interruption had likewi&s;e occurred, of a more &s;erious nature.&mdash;For after they had decreed with an unanimous voice&mdash;That <HI>the per|&s;on of the king is &s;acred and inviolable,</HI> that <HI>the throne is indivi&s;ible;</HI> that <HI>the crown is hereditary, in the males of the reigning family, according to the order of primogeniture, to the perpetual exclu&s;ion of females,</HI> a deputy propo&s;ed, that, before going any further, they &s;hould decide
<Q>whether the branch reigning in Spain could reign in France, though it had renounced the crown of the latter kingdom by the mo&s;t authentic treaties.</Q></P>
<P>Several of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable members re|pre&s;ented, that this was a delicate bu&s;ine&s;s with which it was impolitic to meddle at pre&s;ent, and as unnece&s;&s;ary as imprudent. Mirabeau was of this opinion; but when he found, that much time was likely to be con&s;umed in idle debates, and contemptible vehemence, he endeavoured to cut
<PB N="265" REF="029916_0274_0FE30BF9AD471850">
the matter &s;hort by moving a new que&s;tion&mdash; namely,
<Q>that no one could reign in France, who was not born in the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>But nothing could prevent the agitation of the &s;ame &s;ubject for three days; prolonged either by the fears of one party, or the de&s;ire of another to embroil the a&s;&s;embly, and retard the forma|tion of a con&s;titution. Mirabeau made &s;everal &s;evere, but ju&s;t remarks, on the character of Louis XIV. who&s;e ambition had produced the di&s;pute; and reprobated with dignity, their man|ner of treating a people, as if they were the pro|perty of a chief. Should any difficulty ari&s;e, in future, he maintained, that the nation would then be competent of judge of it; and had an equal right to determine the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as to choo&s;e a new &s;y&s;tem of government.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly, though generally &s;o inattentive to the &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;ound policy, de&s;pi&s;ing moderation, became now beyond mea&s;ure &s;cru|pulous. Some deputies repre&s;ented the danger of alienating to the Engli&s;h the commerce of Spain, by di&s;gu&s;ting it's court; and others anti|cipated the inte&s;tine troubles, which a doubt re&s;pecting the unchangeable de&s;cent of the crown might produce. At la&s;t they re&s;olved to add to the declaration, re&s;pecting the monarchy, that they did not mean to make the decree, <HI>by any means prejudge the effect of renunciations.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were &s;ettling the&s;e things in the a&s;&s;embly the refractory nobles and clergy were intriguing to prevent the king from giving his a&s;&s;ent to the promulgation of the decrees of the 4th of Augu&s;t. The royal <HI>&s;anction</HI> had been de|manded before the import of the word was
<PB N="266" REF="029916_0275_0FE30C35BA2F08E8">
&s;canned; and the court taking advantage of this ambiguity, made the king pretend he mi&s;under|&s;tood the demand; and imagined that they merely a&s;ked for his opinion, and not to know his will. In&s;tead then of a &s;imple mono&s;yllable, he replied by a memoir. He approved, in general, of the &s;pirit of the&s;e determinations; but entered into an inve&s;tigation, more or le&s;s copious, of every article. He weighed the advantages and incon|veniences; and pointed out precautions and modifications, which appeared to him nece&s;&s;ary to realize the former and prevent the latter. He objected particularly to the abolition of &s;ome rents; which, though &s;ub&s;titutes for per&s;onal &s;er|vice, were now actual property; he &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome difficulty that might attend the abolition of tithes; and hinted, that the German princes, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Al&s;ace, &s;ecured to them by treaty, might re&s;ent the infringement. In an&s;wer to the la&s;t objection, a member ob&s;erved, that the in|habitants of this province, who had long been &s;inking under the weight of the&s;e privileges, daily augmented by the connivance of mini&s;ters, had in&s;erted an article in their in&s;tructions ex|pre&s;sly demanding the abolition of this de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem; which reduced them to de&s;pair, and forced them continually to emigrate. Several of the deputies wi&s;hed to have the king's reply re|ferred to the examination of a committee; yet, a great majority in&s;i&s;ting, that the decrees of the 4th of Augu&s;t were not new laws, to be carried into force by the executive power, but abu&s;es which it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to clear away before the formation of a con&s;titution, demanded their immediate promulgation. Accordingly they
<PB N="267" REF="029916_0276_0FE30BFBCDC7A620">
re&s;olved, that the pre&s;ident &s;hould wait on the king and reque&s;t him immediately to order the promulgation of the decrees; a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame time, that the national a&s;&s;embly, when con|&s;idering each article &s;eparately, would pay the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention to the ob&s;ervations com|municated by his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>This imperative petition had the de&s;ired effect, and the king acceded, the 20th of September, to their will, &s;anctioning decrees he did not ap|prove.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t glaring in&s;tance of the con|&s;tituting a&s;&s;embly acting contrary to it's preten|&s;ions; and the king, long in the habit of di&s;&s;emb|ling, always yielding to the pre&s;&s;ure of remon|&s;trances, no matter from what quarter they came, with criminal in&s;incerity acknowledging him&s;elf a cypher, laid the foundation of his own in&s;ig|nificancy, by ordering the promulgation of de|crees, which he believed were incompatible with ju&s;tice, and might involve the French monarchy in di&s;agreeable di&s;putes with foreign princes, when peace was particularly nece&s;&s;ary to calm it's inter|nal convul&s;ions.</P>

<P>After complying with this compul&s;atory re|que&s;t, Louis, who finding that he was left with|out any &s;hare of power &s;eems to have thought very little of his <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ive veto,</HI> determined to play a part that would give an air of &s;incerity to his pre&s;ent conduct, whil&s;t his object was &s;ecretly to favour the efforts of the counter-revolutioni&s;ts; and if po&s;&s;ible effect his own e&s;cape.&mdash;But, in the mean time, he endeavoured to make &s;uch u&s;e of it as might prevent the total derangement of the old &s;y&s;tem, without unveiling his &s;ecret views, and intentions. It is difficult to determine which was the mo&s;t reprehen&s;ible, the folly of the a&s;&s;embly, or the duplicity of the king. If Louis were without character, and controlled by a court without virtue, it amount|ed to a demon&s;tration, that every in&s;idious mean would be employed by the courtiers to rein&s;tate the old government; and recover, if po&s;&s;ible, their former &s;plendor and voluptuous ea&s;e. For, though they were di&s;per&s;ed, it was notorious to all France, nay, to all Europe, that a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence was kept up between the differ|ent parties, and their projects concerted by one of the mo&s;t intriguing of di&s;appointed men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calonne.</NOTE>. It was obvious, therefore, to Mirabeau, that the king ought to be gained over to the &s;ide of the people; and made to con&s;ider him&s;elf as their benefactor, in order to detach him from the cabal. But in this re&s;pect he was unfortunately over-ruled. This mixture of magnanimity, and
<PB N="269" REF="029916_0278_0FE30C02D639D990">
timidity, of wi&s;dom, and head&s;trong folly, di&s;|played by the a&s;&s;embly, appears at the fir&s;t view, to involve &s;uch a contradiction, that every per&s;on unacquainted with the French character would be ready to call in que&s;tion the truth of tho&s;e undeniable facts, which crowd on the heels of each other during the progre&s;s of the great events, that formed the revolution. A &s;uperficial glance over the circum&s;tances, will not enable us to account for an incon&s;i&s;tency, which bor|ders on improbability.&mdash;We mu&s;t, on the con|trary, ever keep in our thoughts, that, whil&s;t they were directed in their political plans by a wild, half comprehended theory, their &s;enti|ments were &s;till governed by the old chivalrous &s;en&s;e of honour, which diffu&s;ing a degree of romantic heroi&s;m into all their actions, a fal&s;e magnanimity would not permit them to que&s;tion the veracity of a man, on whom they believed they were conferring favours; and for whom they certainly made great allowance, if they did not forgive him for countenancing plots, which tended to undermine their favourite &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, the characteri&s;tic of vanity, to become enamoured with ideas, in proportion as they were remote from its conception, until brought to the mind by cau&s;es &s;o natural, as to induce it to believe, that they are the happy and &s;pontaneous flow of its own prolific brain. Their &s;plendor then eclip&s;ing his judgment, the man is hurried on by enthu&s;ia&s;m and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, like a &s;hip at &s;ea, without balla&s;t or helm, by every breath of wind: and, to carry the compa|ri&s;on &s;till further, &s;hould a tempe&s;t chance to ri&s;e in the &s;tate, he is &s;wallowed up in the whirl|pools of confu&s;ion, into the very mid&s;t of which

<P>The occa&s;ions of remarking, that Frenchmen are the vaine&s;t men living, often occur, and here it mu&s;t be in&s;i&s;ted on: for no &s;ooner had they taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of certain philo&s;ophical truths, per&s;uading them&s;elves, that the world was in|debted to them for the di&s;covery, than they &s;eem to have overlooked every other con&s;ideration, but their adoption. Much evil has been the con|&s;equence; yet France is certainly highly indebted to the national a&s;&s;embly for e&s;tabli&s;hing many con&s;titutional principles of liberty, which mu&s;t greatly accelerate the improvement of the public mind, and ultimately produce the perfect govern|ment that they vainly endeavoured to con&s;truct immediately with &s;uch fatal precipitation.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of &s;everal other articles of the con&s;titution was continually interrupted, and not more by the variety of bu&s;ine&s;s, which came under the cognizance of the a&s;&s;embly, than by the want of a proper arrangement of them. Much time was lo&s;t in di&s;puting about the choice of &s;ubjects of deliberation; and the order in which they ought to proceed. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the day was perpetually obliged to give place to epi&s;odical &s;cenes&punc; and men, who came prepared to di&s;cu&s;s one que&s;tion, being obliged to turn to another, lo&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure the benefit of re|flection, and the energy, &s;o different from the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the moment, with which a man &s;upports a well dige&s;ted opinion.</P>
<P>Two or three &s;light debates had ari&s;en on the &s;ubject of quartering a thou&s;and men, of the regular troops, at Ver&s;ailles. The command|ant

The nece&s;&s;ity did not appear &s;o obvious to the public, and, in fact, the demand &s;eemed calculated to provoke the tumults, again&s;t which they were &s;o officiou&s;ly guarding. Mirabeau al&s;o ob&s;erved,
<Q>that the executive power had undoubtedly a right to augment the military &s;orce, in any particular place, when private information, or urgent cir|cum&s;tances, appeared to require it; and that the municipality had, likewi&s;e, a right to de|mand the troops they judged nece&s;&s;ary; yet he could not help thinking it &s;ingular, that the mini&s;ters &s;hould have entru&s;ted the municipality with a &s;ecret, which they did not communicate to the a&s;&s;embly, who might be &s;uppo&s;ed at lea&s;t as anxious to take every precaution for the &s;afety of the town and the king's per&s;on.</Q>
To the&s;e pertinent remarks no attention was paid; and a letter from the mayor of Paris, informing the a&s;&s;embly, that a great number of the di&s;tricts of the metropolis had remon&s;trated again&s;t the introduction of regular troops into Ver&s;ailles, to awe the national guards, was equally neglected; whil&s;t a letter to the pre&s;ident, in the name of the king, informing him that he had taken the different mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to prevent any di&s;|turbances in the place where the national a&s;&s;em|bly were &s;itting, was thrown a&s;ide without any comment.</P>

<P>The&s;e donations, which &s;carcely afforded a temporary &s;upply, rather amu&s;ed than relieved the nation; though they &s;ugge&s;ted a new plan to the mini&s;ter. Necker, therefore, incapable of forming any great de&s;ign for the good of the nation, yet calculating on the general enthu&s;ia&s;m, which pervaded all de&s;criptions and ranks of people, laid before the a&s;&s;embly, the ruinous &s;tate of the finances, propo&s;ing at the &s;ame time, as the only mode of remedying the evil, to require of the citizens a contribution of one-fourth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir income. The a&s;&s;embly was &s;tartled by this propo&s;al, but Mirabeau believing that the peo|ple would now grant whatever their repre&s;en|tatives required, prevailed on the a&s;&s;embly, by a lively repre&s;entation of the perilous &s;tate of the kingdom, to adopt the only plan of &s;alvation which had yet been &s;ugge&s;ted&mdash;in&s;i&s;ting, that this was the only expedient to avoid an infamous national bankruptcy.

<P>From the whole tenor of this &s;peech it is clear, that Mirabeau was in earne&s;t; and that he had fired his imagination, by con&s;idering this plan as an act of heroi&s;m, that would ennoble the revolution, and reflect la&s;ting honour on the national a&s;&s;embly. In this extemporary flow of eloquence, probably the mo&s;t &s;imple and noble of modern times, he mixed none of the rhetoric which frequently entered into his &s;tudied com|po&s;itions; for his periods were often artfully

<P>His addre&s;s to the nation is, indeed, a ma&s;ter|piece; yet, being written to per&s;uade, and not &s;poken to carry a point immediately, and over|whelm oppo&s;ition, there is more rea&s;oning in it; and more artful, though le&s;s forcible, appeals to the pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>To expect a man to give the fourth of what he lived on; and that in the cour&s;e of fifteen months, leaving it to him to make the e&s;timate, was ex|pecting that from virtue, which could only have been produced by enthu&s;ia&s;m.

No ju&s;t Sy&s;tem of taxation yet e&s;tabli&s;hed. Paper money. Nece&s;&s;ity of gradual reform.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE ta&s;k certainly was very difficult, at this cri&s;is, for a mini&s;ter to give &s;atisfaction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the people, and yet &s;upply the wants of the &s;tate; for it was not very likely that the public, who had been exclaiming again&s;t the ince&s;&s;ant de|mands of the old government, would have been plea&s;ed with new burdens, or patiently endured them. Still it is always the height of folly in a financier, to attempt to &s;upply the exigencies of government by any but &s;pecific and certain means: for &s;uch vague mea&s;ures will ever pro|duce a <HI>deficit,</HI> the con&s;equences of which are mo&s;t pernicious to public credit and private comfort.</P>
<P>A man, who has a preci&s;e &s;um to live upon, generally takes into his e&s;timate of expences a certain part of his income as due to the govern|ment, for the protection and &s;ocial advantages it &s;ecures him. This proportion of his income be|ing commonly the &s;ame from period to period, he lays it by for that particular purpo&s;e, and con|tentedly enjoys the remainder. But, &s;hould a weak mini&s;ter, or a capricious government, call on him for an additional &s;um, becau&s;e the taxes have proved unproductive, either through the
<PB N="284" REF="029916_0293_0FE2A26AB1D8BE00">
inability of &s;ome o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he members of the &s;tate, or that they were laid on articles of con&s;umption, and the con&s;umption has not been equal to the calculation; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not only deranges his &s;chemes of dome&s;tic economy, but may be the cau&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;erious inconvenience.</P>
<P>A man who has a limited income, and a large family, is not only obliged to be very indu&s;trious to &s;upport them, but he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;itated to make all his arrangements with the greate&s;t circum&s;pection and exactne&s;s; becau&s;e a trifling lo&s;s, by involving him in debt, might lead to his ruin, including that of his family. The rich man, indeed, &s;eldom thinks of the&s;e mo&s;t cruel misfortunes; for a few pounds, more or le&s;s, are of no real importance to him. Yet the poor man, nay even the man of moderate fortune, is liable to have his whole &s;cheme of life broken by a circum&s;tance of this kind, and all his future days embittered by a perpetual &s;truggle with pecuniary vexations.</P>
<P>Governments, which ought to protect, and not oppre&s;s mankind, cannot be too regular in their demands; for the manner of levying taxes is of the highe&s;t importance to political economy, and the happine&s;s of individuals. No govern|ment has yet e&s;tabli&s;hed a ju&s;t &s;y&s;tem of taxa|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Holland almo&s;t all the taxes are collected in the &s;hape of exci&s;e.</P>
<P>In France, formerly, the taxes were generally internal; but, &s;ince the mode e&s;tabli&s;hed of making a revenue of 300,000,000<HI>l.</HI> by the land and hou&s;e tax part of the 580,000,000<HI>l.</HI> e&s;timated to be the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, it appears, that this was too great a proportion to be obtain|ed in that way. Hence the revenue of France has lately faile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a great degree.</P>
<P>In America the taxes of the Federal government have been lately e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;olely on the cu&s;toms, that is to &s;ay, on goods imported. The&s;e operate two ways; en|couraging home manufactures, and di&s;couraging the ma|nufactures of other countries.</P>
<P>Great Britain has levied her revenue on cu&s;toms both inwards and outwards; on exci&s;e, principally internal; on &s;tamps, which operate both internally and externally; and on fixed objects, as well as internal con&s;umption, (as &s;alt).</P></NOTE>: for in every country the expences of

government have fallen unequally on the citizens; and, perhaps, it is not po&s;&s;ible to render them perfectly equal, but by laying all the taxes on land, the mother of every production.</P>
<P>In this po&s;ture of affairs the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the French in the cau&s;e of liberty might have been turned to the advantage of a new and permanent &s;y&s;tem of finance. An able, bold mini&s;ter, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the confidence of the nation, might have recommended with &s;ucce&s;s the taking of the national property under the direct management of the a&s;&s;embly; and then endeavouring to rai&s;e a loan on that property, he would have given re&s;pectability to the new government, by imme|diately procuring the &s;upplies indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary not only to keep it, but to put it in motion.</P>
<P>In times of civil commotion, or during a ge|neral convul&s;ion, men who have money, and they are commonly mo&s;t timid and cautious, are very apt to take care of it, even at the expence of their intere&s;t; and, therefore, it was to be pre&s;umed, that the mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed men of France would not have been very ready to &s;ub&s;cribe to the dif|ferent
<PB N="286" REF="029916_0295_0FE30C8FB1F16E50">
loans propo&s;ed by the mini&s;ter, unle&s;s the &s;ecurity had been obvious, or the &s;peculative ad|vantages exorbitant. But if Necker, whom the prudent u&s;urer adored as his tutelar god, had &s;aid to the nation
<Q>there is a property worth 4,700,000,000<HI>l.</HI> independent of the property of the emigrants, take it into your immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and, whil&s;t the &s;ales are going on, give it as a guarantee for the loan you want. This ju&s;t and dignified mea&s;ure will not only relieve your pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, but it will be &s;ufficient to enable you to fulfil great part of your former engagements.</Q>
There would have been then no need of the eloquence of Mira|beau; rea&s;on would have done the bu&s;ine&s;s; and men, attending to their own intere&s;t, would have promoted the public good, without having their heads turned giddy by romantic flights of he|roi&s;m.</P>
<P>The immediate and ince&s;&s;ant wants of a &s;tate mu&s;t always be &s;upplied; prudence therefore, requires, that the directors of the finances &s;hould rather provide by anticipation for its wants than &s;uffer a <HI>deficit.</HI> The government being once in arrears, additional taxes become indi&s;pen&s;able to bring forward the balance, or the nation mu&s;t have recour&s;e to paper notes; an expedient, as experience has &s;hown, always to be dreaded, becau&s;e by encrea&s;ing the debt it only extends the evil. And this increa&s;ing debt, like a ball of &s;now, gathering as it rolls, &s;oon attains a wonderful magnitude. Every &s;tate, which has unavoidably accumulated its debt, ought, provided th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e at the helm wi&s;h to pre&s;erve the government, and extend the &s;ecurity and com|forts

of its citizens, to take every ju&s;t mea&s;ure to render the intere&s;t &s;ecure, and to fund the principal; for as it augments, like the petrifying ma&s;s, it &s;tands in the way of all improvement, &s;preading the chilling mi&s;eries of poverty around &mdash;till the evil baffling all expedients, a mighty cra&s;h produces a new order of things, over|whelming with the ruins of the old, thou&s;ands of innocent victims.</P>
<P>The precious metals have been con&s;idered as the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible &s;igns of value to facilitate the exchange of commodities to &s;upply our reci|procal wants: and they will ever be nece&s;&s;ary to our comfort, whil&s;t by the common con&s;ent of mankind they are the &s;tandard of exchange. Gold and &s;ilver have a &s;pecific value, becau&s;e it is not ea&s;y to accumulate them beyond a certain quantity. Paper, on the contrary, is a dangerous expedient, except under a well e&s;tabli&s;hed go|vernment: and even then the bu&s;ine&s;s ought to be conducted with great moderation and &s;aga|city.&mdash;Perhaps it would be wi&s;e, that its extent &s;hould be con&s;i&s;tent with the commerce of the country, and the quantity of &s;pecies actually in it&mdash;But it is the &s;pirit of commerce to &s;tretch credit too far. The notes, al&s;o, which are i&s;&s;ued by a &s;tate before its government is well e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, will certainly be depreciated; and in propor|tion as they grow precarious, the gold and &s;ilver, which was formerly in circulation will vani&s;h, and every article of trade, and all the comforts of life will bear a higher price.</P>
<P>The&s;e are con&s;iderations, which ought to have occured to the French mini&s;ter, and have led him to take decided mea&s;ures. The intere&s;t of
<PB N="288" REF="029916_0297_0FE30C91922AE100">
the national debt was 255,395,141 <HI>l.</HI> by a report for the year 1792. Necker, by his account dated the 1&s;t of May, 1789, &s;tates the in|come at 475,294,000<HI>l.,</HI> and the expences at 531,533,000<HI>l.</HI>: con&s;equently there was a de|ficiency of 56,239,000<HI>l.</HI>; and it was not proba|ble, it could not even be expected, that during the convul&s;ions of a revolution the taxes would be regularly paid: the debt, then, and the de|mands of the &s;tate mu&s;t increa&s;e.</P>
<P>The credit of every government greatly de|pends on the regulation of its finances; and the mo&s;t certain way to have given &s;tability to the new &s;y&s;tem, would have been by making &s;uch arrangements as would have in&s;ured promptitude of payment. No mini&s;ter ever had it &s;o much in his power to have taken mea&s;ures glorious for France, beneficial to Europe, happy for the peo|ple of the day, and advantageous to po&s;terity. No epocha &s;ince the inflated &s;y&s;tem of paper (the full blown bladders of public credit, which may be de&s;troyed by the prick of a pin) was invented, ever appeared &s;o favourable as that juncture in France, to have overturned it completely: and by overlooking the&s;e circum&s;tances, the nation has probably lo&s;t mo&s;t of the advantages, which her finances might have gained by the revolution.</P>
<P>Such mi&s;takes, whil&s;t they involve in them a thou&s;and difficulties, prove the nece&s;&s;ity of gra|dual reform; le&s;t the light &s;uddenly breaking-in on a benighted people, &s;hould overpower the under&s;tanding it ought to direct. The line in which Necker had been accu&s;tomed to move, by re&s;training what little energy his mind was capa|ble of exerting, precluded the po&s;&s;ibility of his
<PB N="289" REF="029916_0298_0FE30CCA60D44818">
&s;eeing the faint lines marked on an expan&s;ive &s;cale, which afforded the data for calculations; and the nation, confiding to him the direction of a bu&s;ine&s;s for which he had not &s;ufficient talents, &s;eems to have contemplated in imagination a pro&s;pect, which has not yet been realized; and whil&s;t expectation hovered on its margin, the dazzling &s;cenery was ob&s;cured by clouds the mo&s;t threatening and tremendous.</P>
<P>The&s;e are evils that from the beginning of time have attended precipitate and great changes. The improvements in philo&s;ophy and morals have been extremely tardy. All &s;udden revolutions have been as &s;uddenly overturned, and things thrown back below their former &s;tate. The im|provements in the &s;cience of politics have been &s;till more &s;low in their advancement than tho&s;e of philo&s;ophy and morals; but the revolution in France has been progre&s;&s;ive. It was a revolution in the minds of men; and only demanded a new &s;y&s;tem of government to be adapted to that change. This was not generally perceived; and the politicians of the day ran wildly from one extreme to the other, without recollecting, that even Mo&s;es &s;ojourning forty years in the wilder|ne&s;s could but conduct the Jews to the borders of the promi&s;ed land, after the fir&s;t generation had peri&s;hed in their prejudices; the mo&s;t inve|terate &s;ins of men.</P>
<P>This is not a di&s;couraging con&s;ideration. Our ance&s;tors have laboured for us; and we, in our turn, mu&s;t labour for po&s;terity.

in&s;trument has &s;carcely ever been able to bring it to a tolerable degree of perfection; and the di&s;coveries of every man of genius, the optics of Newton excepted, have been improved, if not extended, by their followers.&mdash;Can it then be expected, that the &s;cience of politics and &s;inance, the mo&s;t important, and mo&s;t difficult of all human improvements; a &s;cience which involves the pa&s;&s;ions, tempers, and manners of men and nations, e&s;timates their wants, maladies, comforts, happine&s;s, and mi&s;ery, and computes the &s;um of good or evil flowing from &s;ocial in&s;ti|tutions; will not require the &s;ame gradations, and advance by &s;teps equally &s;low to that &s;tate of perfection nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the &s;acred rights of every human creature?</P>
<P>The vanity and weakne&s;s of men have conti|nually tended to retard this progre&s;s of things: &s;till it is going forward; and though the fatal pre&s;umption of the head&s;trong French, and the more de&s;tructive ambition of their foreign ene|mies, have given it a check, we may contemplate with complacent &s;erenity the approximation of the glorious era, when the appellations of fool and tyrant will be &s;ynonymous.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE conduct of the a&s;&s;embly in lo&s;ing &s;o much time&mdash;the mo&s;t precious time to &s;ecure the happine&s;s of their country, and enable the pre|&s;ent generation to participate in the ble&s;&s;ings they were preparing for po&s;terity, in&s;tead of having to encounter all the mi&s;eries of anarchy, can never be &s;ufficiently lamented. France had al|ready gained her freedom; the nation had already a&s;certained certain, and the mo&s;t important, po|litical
<PB N="292" REF="029916_0301_0FE30C9524C03400">
truths: it ought, therefore, to have been the next con&s;ideration, how the&s;e were to be pre&s;erved, and the liberty of the empire con|&s;olidated on a ba&s;is that time would only render more firm.</P>
<P>Moderate men, or real patriots, would have been &s;atisfied with what had been gained, for the pre&s;ent, allowing the re&s;t to follow progre&s;|&s;ively. It was the mo&s;t political and the mo&s;t rea&s;onable way to &s;ecure the acqui&s;ition. In this &s;ituation France had to contend with the preju|dices of half Europe, at lea&s;t, and to counteract the influence of the in&s;idious intriguers, who were oppo&s;ing them&s;elves to her regeneration; to fa|cilitate which the a&s;&s;embly ought to have made it one of their main objects to render the king contented with the change; and then the machi|nations of all the underminers of the revolution, would not have loo&s;ened one fundamental &s;tone, to endanger the ri&s;ing edifice.</P>
<P>Such is the difference between men acting from a practical knowledge, and men who are governed entirely by theory, or no principle whatever. Mo&s;t of the United States of Ame|rica formed their &s;eparate con&s;titutions within a month, and none took more than three, after the declaration of their independence by congre&s;s. There certainly was a va&s;t di&s;tinction between tho&s;e &s;tates, then the colonies of Great Britain, and France after the 14th of July; but both countries were without a government. America with an enemy in the heart of their empire, and France threatened with an attack. The leading men of America, however, knew, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of having &s;ome kind of govern|ment,
<PB N="293" REF="029916_0302_0FE30C52D5BDEEE8">
and &s;eem to have perceived the ea&s;e, with which any &s;ub&s;equent alterations could be effect|ed. The members of the national a&s;&s;embly, on the contrary, found them&s;elves &s;urrounded with ruins; and aiming at a &s;tate of perfection for which the minds of the people were not &s;uffi|ciently mature; affecting likewi&s;e to be directed by a magnanimous di&s;inte re&s;tedne&s;s, they not only planted the germ of the mo&s;t dangerous and licentious &s;pirit, but they continued to irritate the de&s;perate courtiers, who, having determined to oppo&s;e &s;tratagem to force, and not &s;ucceed|ing, re&s;ted all their future hopes on the king's e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The liberty of the pre&s;s, which had been vir|tually e&s;tabli&s;hed, at this period, was a &s;ucce&s;sful engine employed again&s;t the a&s;&s;embly. And to a nation celebrated for epigramatic fancy, and who&s;e ta&s;te had been &s;o refined by art, that they had lo&s;t the ze&s;t of nature, the &s;implicity of &s;ome of the members, their awkward figures, and ru&s;tic gait, compared with the courtly mien, and ea&s;y a&s;&s;urance of the chevaliers of Ver&s;ailles, af|forded an excellent &s;ubject. Some of the&s;e &s;atires were written with con&s;iderable wit, and &s;uch a happy turn of caricature, that it is impo&s;&s;ible not to laugh with the author, though indirectly ri|diculing the principles you hold &s;acred. The mo&s;t re&s;pectable decrees, the mo&s;t important, and &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, were twi&s;ted into je&s;ts; which divided the people without doors into two di&s;|tinct parties; one, &s;peaking of the a&s;&s;embly with &s;overeign contempt, as a &s;et of up&s;tarts and bab|bling knaves; and the other, &s;etting up new thrones for their favourites, and viewing them
<PB N="294" REF="029916_0303_0FE30C9BB1E81F80">
with blind admiration, as if they were a &s;ynod of demi-gods. The countenancing of this abu&s;e of freedom was ill-judged. The different parties were already &s;ufficiently heated; yet it would have been impo&s;&s;ible, perhaps, to have re&s;trained the temper of the times, &s;o &s;trong is the intoxica|tion of a new folly, though it would have been ea&s;y for the a&s;&s;embly to have pa&s;&s;ed a decree re|&s;pecting libels. But &s;o ardent was become their pa&s;&s;ion for liberty, that they were unable to di&s;cri|minate between a licentous u&s;e of that important invention, and it's real utility. Treating then with an untimely di&s;dain the many abu&s;ive publi|cations, which were &s;old within the very walls where they were &s;itting, they were not aware of the effect which they produced on the minds of mock heroes, who, having no principle but honour, were ready to ri&s;k their lives to &s;ooth di&s;tre&s;&s;ed beauty, no matter what produced it; or to alleviate the &s;ufferings of a king, though the con&s;equence of his turpitude or tergiver&s;ation.</P>
<P>After the wreck of a government the plan of a new con&s;titution ought to be immediately form|ed, that is, as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will po&s;&s;ibly admit, and pre&s;ented to the citizens for their acceptance; or rather the people &s;hould depute men for that purpo&s;e, and give them a limited time for framing one. A con&s;titution is a &s;tandard for the people to rally round. It is the pillar of a government, the bond of all &s;ocial unity and order.

<P>Machiavelian cunning, however, &s;till directed the movements of all the courts of Europe; and the&s;e political moles, too well perceiving the ti|midity that was mixed with the blu&s;tering courage of the a&s;&s;embly, only waited for a favourble &s;ea&s;on to overturn the ri&s;ing edifice.

Their continual theme was the ignomi|nious &s;tate to which the mo&s;t mild of the Bourbons was reduced, by men, who u&s;urped the reins of government, and trampled on the honours of that augu&s;t and ancient family.

<P>The univer&s;al damp, which the revolution had given to the courts of Europe, producing among them a lively &s;ympathy for the &s;ombre atmo&s;phere of Ver&s;ailles, a general &s;orrow was con&s;equently expre&s;&s;ed by all their minions, and expre&s;&s;ed with unfeigned concern; for the want of the u&s;ual routine of amu&s;ements tended to make it real. Hope, indeed, began again to animate them, when the king was prevailed on to concert his e&s;cape; yet their eagerne&s;s to accelerate his departure for the frontiers, where they propo&s;ed to erect the royal &s;tan|dard, to avail them&s;elves of the promixity of German connections, was in a great degree the the cau&s;e of defeating that ill contrived de|&s;ign.</P>
<P>A de&s;ign formed very early, and &s;y&s;temati|cally pur&s;ued, was probably rendered entirely abortive by the ob&s;tinacy of the court; who &s;till per&s;i&s;ted to cheri&s;h the belief, that the public opinion was changed only for the moment, and that their deeply rooted love of royalty would bring them back to what they termed their duty, when the efferve&s;cence excited by novelty had &s;ub&s;ided. And thinking, that the cordial reception given by the Pari&s;ians to the &s;oldiery had contributed to e&s;trange them, and effect the revolution, they determined to regain their lo&s;t ground, and dazzle them by fea&s;ts,

in&s;tead of &s;tealing on their affections by ho&s;pi|tality.&mdash;Still, bearing impatiently their humili|ating &s;ituation, the courtiers could not help vauntingly expo&s;ing their project; and the bab|bling of joy &s;howed the weakne&s;s of the heads that could &s;o &s;oon be intoxicated by hope.</P>
<P>A preparatory &s;tep was thought nece&s;&s;ary to awaken a &s;en&s;e of allegiance in the brea&s;ts of the people, and to promote a divi&s;ion among&s;t them, if not their entire concurrence, after the cabinet &s;hould have &s;ecurely in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the per|&s;on of the king; and this divi&s;ion would then enable them to calculate their &s;trength, and act accordingly. For this purpo&s;e, in &s;pite of the comments that had been made on the fe&s;tivity at Ver&s;ailles, which &s;eemed before to in&s;ult the mi&s;ery of the people and greatly tended to pro|voke the exertions that overturned the Ba&s;tile and changed the whole face of things, they pro|jected another entertainment to &s;educe the mili|tary, encouraged to throng round the court, whil&s;t famine was at the very gates of Paris. But previou&s;ly the old French guards, who had been incorporated with the <HI>garde bourgeoi&s;e,</HI> be|gan to manife&s;t &s;ome &s;ymptoms of di&s;content at not being allowed to guard the per&s;on of the king. Whether they con&s;idered their honour as wounded, or were &s;pirited up to a&s;pire at regain|ing this privilege is not decided; but it is clear, that the court, either to facilitate the entrance of fre&s;h troops, or from a real di&s;like to men, who had taken &s;uch an active part in di&s;concerting their fir&s;t plot, oppo&s;ed their wi&s;h; and even the municipality, as has been already noticed, was induced to reque&s;t, that a regiment of fre&s;h

troops might be called in to guard the per&s;on of the king, and keep the peace, which this trifling di&s;pute, &s;welled into an in&s;urrection in the report, threatened to di&s;turb.</P>
<P>The king's body-guards, who&s;e time of &s;ervice expired the fir&s;t of October, were &s;till retained with tho&s;e who came to replace them; and an immen&s;e crowd of &s;upernumeraries continued daily to increa&s;e this corps, which had not yet &s;worn allegiance to the nation. The officers, in particular, flocked to Ver&s;ailles, amounting to between eleven and twelve hundred, con&s;tantly parading together. The univer&s;al topic was com|mi&s;eration of the king's fate, and in&s;inuations re&s;pecting the ambition of the a&s;&s;embly. Yet, even there the court party &s;eemed to be prevail|ing: a pre&s;ident attached to loyalty was elected; and Mirabeau's remon&s;trances, re&s;pecting the augmentation of the troops, were di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>Mean time, not only the officers of the new regiment, but tho&s;e of the national guards, were care&s;&s;ed by the court, whil&s;t the citizens, with more &s;agacity, were lavi&s;h of their attention to the &s;oldiers. The cabinet had not &s;ufficient di&s;|cernment to perceive, that the people were now to be led, not driven; and the popular promoters of anarchy, to &s;erve their private intere&s;t availed them&s;elves, unfortunately, but too well of this want of judgment.&mdash;Thus whil&s;t one party, declaiming on the nece&s;&s;ity of order, &s;eemed to be endeavouring to rivet on them the chains of &s;ervitude, the other lifted them above the law with vain glorious notions of their &s;overeignty. &mdash;And this &s;overeignty of the people, the perfec|tion of the &s;cience of government, only to be

theatrical di&s;play of &s;en&s;ibility, carried to the highe&s;t pitch, produced emotions almo&s;t convul|&s;ive in the whole circle, of which an Engli&s;h reader can &s;carcely form an idea. The king, who is always repre&s;ented as innocent, though always giving proofs that he more than connived at the attempts to recover his power, was like|wi&s;e prevailed on to &s;hew him&s;elf at this enter|tainment. And &s;ome of the &s;ame &s;oldiery, who had refu&s;ed to &s;econd the former project of the cabal, were now induced to utter in&s;ults and menaces again&s;t the very authority, they then &s;upported. 'The national cockade,' exclaimed Mirabeau,
<Q>that emblem of the defenders of liberty, has been torn in pieces, and &s;tamped under foot; and another en&s;ign put into its place.&mdash;Yes; even under the eye of the mo|narch, who allowed him&s;elf to be &s;tyled&mdash; <HI>Re&s;torer of the rights of his people,</HI> they have dared to hoi&s;t a &s;ignal of faction.</Q></P>

<P>The rumour re&s;pecting them, which reached Paris, contained many exaggerated circum&s;tan|ces; and was regarded as the commencement of fre&s;h ho&s;tilities, on the part of the court. The cry now was, that the &s;tunned ari&s;tocracy had again reared it's head; and that a number of old officers, chevaliers of St. Louis, had &s;igned a a promi&s;e to join the body-guards in a new at|tempt. This li&s;t was &s;aid to contain thirty thou|&s;and &s;ignatures; and idle as the tale was, it &s;eemed to be confirmed by the appearance of white and

black cockades, which incon&s;iderate individuals di&s;played at the ri&s;k of their lives. The&s;e, &s;aid the Pari&s;ians, are the fir&s;t indications of a pro|jected civil war&mdash;the court wi&s;h only to have the king &s;afe to head them before they &s;peak out:&mdash; he ought, therefore, to be removed to Paris, inferred the politicians of the palais royal. The exa&s;perating of the people in this manner was certainly the mo&s;t ab&s;urd blundering folly that could have ruined a party, who apparently &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of dividing the people in order to conquer them. It was, in fact, a &s;pecies of madne&s;s, and can be accounted for only by re|collecting the ineffable contempt really felt by the court for the <HI>canaille,</HI> which made them &s;till imagine the revolution to be only a temporary convul&s;ion, not believing it po&s;&s;ible, in &s;pite of the daily events, that they could be cru&s;hed by the ma&s;s they de&s;pi&s;ed. Their pre&s;umption pro|ceeded from their ignorance, and was incurable.</P>
<P>The queen was &s;uppo&s;ed to be at the head of this weak con&s;piracy, to withdraw the &s;oldiery from &s;iding with the people. She had pre&s;ented colours to the national guards of Ver&s;ailles, and when they waited on her to expre&s;s their thanks, &s;he replied, with the mo&s;t winning affability,
<Q>the nation and the army ought to be as well affected to the king as we our&s;elves are. I was quite charmed with what pa&s;&s;ed on Thur&s;day.</Q>
This was the day of the fea&s;t.</P>
<P>A &s;carcity of bread, the common grievance of the revolution, aggravated the vague fears of the Pari&s;ians, and made the people &s;o de&s;perate, that it was not difficult to per&s;uade them to un|dertake

any enterprize; and the torrent of re&s;ent|ment and enthu&s;ia&s;m required only to be directed to a point to carry every thing before it. Liberty was the con&s;tant watch-word; though few knew in what it con&s;i&s;ted.&mdash;It &s;eems, indeed, to be nece&s;&s;ary, that every &s;pecies of enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;hould be fermented by ignorance to carry it to any height. My&s;tery alone gives full play to the imagination, men pur&s;uing with ardor objects indi&s;tinctly &s;een or under&s;tood, becau&s;e each man &s;hapes them to his ta&s;te, and looks for &s;omething beyond even his own conception, when he is un|able to form a ju&s;t idea.</P>
<P>The Pari&s;ians were now continually brooding over the wrongs they had heretofore only enu|merated in a &s;ong; and changing ridicule into invective, all called for redre&s;s, looking for a degree of public happine&s;s immediately, which could not be attained, and ought not to have been expected, before an alteration in the na|tional character &s;econded the &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment.</P>
<P>From the enjoyment of more freedom than the women of other parts of the world, tho&s;e of France have acquired more independence of &s;pirit than any others; it has, therefore, been the &s;cheme of de&s;igning men very often &s;ince the re|volution, to lurk behind them as a kind of &s;afe|guard, working them up to &s;ome de&s;perate act, and then terming it a folly, becau&s;e merely the rage of women, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be actuated only by the emotions of the moment. Early then on the fifth of October a multitude of women by &s;ome impul&s;e were collected together; and ha&s;ten|ing

to the <HI>H&ocirc;tel-de-Ville</HI> obliged every female they met to accompany them, even entering many hou&s;es to force others to follow in their train.</P>
<P>The concour&s;e, at fir&s;t, con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;tly of market women, and the lowe&s;t refu&s;e of the &s;treets, women who had thrown off the virtues of one &s;ex without having power to a&s;&s;ume more than the vices of the other. A number of men al&s;o followed them, armed with pikes, bludgeons, and hatchets; but they were &s;trictly &s;peaking a mob, affixing all the odium to the appellation it can po&s;&s;ibly import; and not to be confounded with the hone&s;t multitude, who took the Ba&s;tile. &mdash;In fact, &s;uch a rabble has &s;eldom been gathered together; and they quickly &s;howed, that their movement was not the effect of public &s;pirit.</P>
<P>They fir&s;t talked of addre&s;&s;ing the committee appointed by the municipality to &s;uperintend the operations nece&s;&s;ary to obtain provi&s;ion for the city, and to remon&s;trate re&s;pecting their inatten|tion or indifference to the public calamity. Mean time a new cord was fixed to the notorious lamp-iron, where the amu&s;ement of death was fir&s;t tolerated. The national guards, forming a hedge of bayonets to prevent the women from entering the hotel, kept them in &s;u&s;pen&s;e a few moments. &mdash; When uttering a loud and general cry, they hurled a volley of &s;tones at the &s;oldiers, who, unwilling, or a&s;hamed, to fire on women, though with the appearance of furies, retreated into the hall, and left the pa&s;&s;age free. They then &s;ought for arms; and breaking open the doors of the magazines, &s;oon procured fu&s;ils, cannons and ammunition; and even took advantage of the con|fu&s;ion to carry off money and notes belonging to
<PB N="312" REF="029916_0321_0FE30CAA99F61670">
the public. In the interim &s;ome went to &s;earch for the volunteers of the Ba&s;tile, and cho&s;e a commander from among them to conduct the party to Ver&s;ailles; whil&s;t others tied cords to the carriages of the cannons to drag them along. &mdash;But the&s;e, being mo&s;tly marine artillery, did not follow with the alacrity nece&s;&s;ary to accord with their wi&s;hes; they, therefore, &s;topped &s;eve|ral coaches, forcing the men to get out and the ladies to join them; fa&s;tening the cannons be|hind, on which a number of the mo&s;t furious mounted, brandi&s;hing whatever weapon they had found, or the matches of the cannons. Some drove the hor&s;es, and others charged them&s;elves with the care of the powder and ball, falling into ranks to facilitate their march. They took the road by the <HI>Champs Eli&s;&eacute;es</HI> about noon, to the number of four thou&s;and, e&s;corted by four or five hundred men, armed with every thing on which they could lay their hand.</P>
<P>Mean time the <HI>toc&s;in</HI> &s;ounded from all parts; the French guards, &s;till urged on by wounded pride, loudly declared, that the king ought to be brought to Paris; and many of the citizens, not on duty, concurred with the re&s;t of the na|tional guards in the &s;ame opinion, particularly tho&s;e accu&s;tomed to attend the harangues at the Palais Royal. La Fayette, refu&s;ing to accom|pany, endeavoured to calm them. But finding, that the tumult increa&s;ed, and that prayers were giving place to menaces, he offered to make known to the king, at their head, the wi&s;hes of the capi|tal, if the municipality gave him orders to this effect. Their council was now a&s;&s;embled: yet prolonging the deliberation till between four

and five o'clock in the afternoon, the people be|came &s;o very impatient, that it was thought pru|dent to allow them to &s;et out: and the exclama|tions of the populace proved how ea&s;y it was to govern, or lead them a&s;tray, by every fre&s;h hope.</P>
<P>Few events have happened at Paris, that have not been attributed by the different parties to the machinations of the leaders on the other &s;ide; to blacken who&s;e characters, when they had the upper hand, the mo&s;t audacious fal&s;ehoods have been indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated; the detection of which has induced many calm ob&s;ervers to be|lieve, that all the accounts of plots and con&s;pira|cies were fabricated in the &s;ame manner; not con&s;idering, that even the univer&s;ality of the&s;e &s;u&s;picions was a proof of the intriguing character of the people, who from a knowledge of them|&s;elves became thus mi&s;tru&s;tful of others. It was currently reported, that very con&s;iderable &s;ums had been di&s;tributed among&s;t the mob, before it marched to Ver&s;ailles; and, though many fabu|lous &s;tories of &s;howers of gold have &s;ince been retailed by the credulous, this &s;eems, from their &s;ub&s;equent conduct, to have had &s;ome foundation: for nothing like the heroi&s;m, the di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s, appeared, which in mo&s;t other ri&s;ings of the Pari&s;ians, has formed a &s;triking contra&s;t with their barbarity; &s;ometimes &s;ufficient to oblige us, lamenting the delu&s;ions of ignorance, to give the &s;oft name of enthu&s;ia&s;m to cruelty; re&s;pecting the intention, though dete&s;ting the effects. Now, on the contrary, acting like a gang of thieves, they gave colour to the report&mdash;that the fir&s;t in&s;tigators of the riot were hired a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins.&mdash;And

hired by whom?&mdash;The public voice repeats, on every &s;ide, the de&s;picable duke of Orleans, who&s;e immen&s;e e&s;tate had given him an undue influence in the bailliages, and who &s;till exerci&s;ed all the means that cunning could devi&s;e, and wealth produce, to revenge him&s;elf on the royal family. He was particularly incen&s;ed again&s;t the queen, who having treated him with the con|tempt which he doubtle&s;s merited, and even in|fluenced the king to bani&s;h him to one of his country &s;eats, when he uttered &s;ome popular &s;entiments, he continued to nouri&s;h the mo&s;t im|placable hatred to her per&s;on, whil&s;t the changing &s;entiments of the nation re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent branch of his family excited in him hopes, that would at once have gratified both his revenge and his ambition.</P>
<P>There is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o calculating the mi&s;chief which may be produced by a revengeful cunning knave, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the forcible engine of gold to move his projects, and acting by agency, which, like a &s;ubterraneous fire, that for a long time has been putting the combu&s;tible matter into a &s;tate of fu&s;ion, bur&s;ts out unexpectedly, and the &s;udden eruption &s;preads around terror and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The agents of de&s;poti&s;m, and of vengeful am|bition, employed the &s;ame means to agitate the minds of the Pari&s;ians; and covered as they now are with foul &s;tains, it is an acknowledgment due to their original good di&s;po&s;ition, to note, that at this period they were &s;o orderly it re|quired con&s;iderable management to lead them into any gro&s;s irregularity of conduct.

<PB N="315" REF="029916_0324_0FE30CE52CA66B80">
put in motion a body of the mo&s;t de&s;perate women; &s;ome of whom were half fami&s;hed for want of bread, which had purpo&s;ely been render|ed &s;carce to facilitate the atrocious de&s;ign of murdering both the king and queen in a broil, that would appear to be produced &s;olely by the rage of famine.</P>
<P>The &s;hamele&s;s manner in which the entertain|ment of the officers of the body guards had been conducted; the indi&s;creet vi&s;it of the queen to intere&s;t the army in the cau&s;e of royalty, coming in artfully after the rabble of &s;oldiers had been allowed to enter; together with the imprudent expre&s;&s;ions of which &s;he afterwards made u&s;e; &s;erved as pretexts, nay, may have been &s;ome of the cau&s;es of the&s;e women &s;u&s;pecting, that the dearth of bread in the capital was owing to the contrivance of the court, who had &s;o often pro|duced the &s;ame effect to promote their &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es. They believed then, that the only &s;ure way to remedy &s;uch a grievous calamity, in future, would be to emplore the king to re&s;ide at Paris: and the national militia, compo&s;ed of more orderly citizens, who thought the report of a premedita|ted e&s;cape was not without foundation, imagined, that they &s;hould nip a civil war in the bud, by preventing the king's departure, and &s;eparate him effectually from the cabal, to whom they attributed all his mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the multitude were advancing, the a&s;&s;embly were con&s;idering the king's reply to their reque&s;t to &s;anction the declaration of rights, and the fir&s;t articles of the con&s;titution, before the &s;upplies were granted. The reply was couched in terms &s;omewhat vague, yet its mean|ing
<PB N="316" REF="029916_0325_0FE30CB3AA5EF838">
could not be mi&s;under&s;tood. He ob&s;erved, that the articles of the con&s;titution could be judged of only in their connection with the whole; neverthele&s;s he thought it natural, that at the moment the nation was called upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t the government by a &s;ignal act of confi|dence and patrioti&s;m, they &s;hould expect to be re-a&s;&s;ured re&s;pecting their principal intere&s;t.&mdash; 'Accordingly,' he continues,
<Q>taking it for granted, that the fir&s;t articles of the con&s;titu|tion, which you have pre&s;ented to me, united to the completion of your labours, will &s;atisfy the wi&s;hes of my people, and &s;ecure the hap|pine&s;s and pro&s;perity of the kingdom, conform|ably to your de&s;ire I accept them; but with one po&s;itive condition, from which I will never depart; namely, that from the general re&s;ult of your deliberations the executive power &s;hall have its entire effect in the hands of the mo|narch. Still it remains for me to a&s;&s;ure you with frankne&s;s, that, if I give my &s;anction of acceptance to the &s;everal articles, which you have laid before me, it is not becau&s;e they in|di&s;criminately give me an idea of perfection; but I believe it laudable in me to pay this re&s;pect to the wi&s;hes of the deputies of the nation, and to the alarming circum&s;tances, which &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;s us to de&s;ire above all things the prompt re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace, order, and confidence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;hall not deliver my &s;entiments re&s;pecting your declaration of the rights of man and of citizens. It contains excellent maxims proper to direct your deliberations; but principles &s;u&s;|ceptible of application, and even of different

interpretations, cannot be ju&s;tly appreciated, and have only need of being &s;o when their true &s;en&s;e is determined by the laws, to which they ought to be the ba&s;is.</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ubterfuge employed in this an&s;wer, the profound di&s;&s;imulation of the king appears; and that 'pitiful re&s;pect for fal&s;e honour,' which makes a man boggle at a naked untruth, even when uttering a number of contemptible preva|rications. Thus did he at fir&s;t &s;truggle again&s;t every conce&s;&s;ion, again&s;t granting any real free|dom to the people; yet afterwards unable to maintain his ground, he impotently gave way before the &s;torm he had rai&s;ed, every time lo&s;ing a part of the authority which depended on opinion.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly manife&s;ted an univer&s;al di&s;con|tent. One of the members remarked, that the king with-held his acceptance of the declaration of rights; and only yielded to circum&s;tances in accepting the con&s;titutional articles: he, there|fore, moved, that no taxes &s;hould be levied, be|fore the declaration of rights and the con&s;titu|tion &s;hould be accepted, without any re&s;ervation. &mdash;Another a&s;&s;erted that the king's reply ought to have been counter-&s;igned by one of the mini|&s;ters. What an ab&s;urdity! yet the inviolability of the king &s;tanding in their way, it &s;eemed to be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure mini&s;terial re&s;pon&s;iblity, to render it null; not only to prevent the mini&s;ters from finding &s;helter behind it, but to make it utterly u&s;ele&s;s to the king, who was thus, literally &s;peaking, reduced to a cypher. Mirabeau, how|ever, after alluding with energy to the entertain|ment, which, out of deri&s;ion had been termed
<PB N="318" REF="029916_0327_0FE30CB52D1F1620">
patriotic, made three or four motions. One was,
<Q>that no act emanating from the king &s;hould be declared without the &s;ignature of a &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</Q>
&mdash;So incon&s;i&s;tent was the man, who argued with &s;uch eloquence for the ab&s;olute <HI>veto:</HI> &mdash;Another was,
<Q>that his maje&s;ty would plea&s;e to be explicit; and not by a conditional con&s;ent, extorted by circum&s;tances, leave any doubt of his &s;incere concurrence in the mind of the people.</Q>
It was al&s;o noticed, to corroborate the inference, that the king was only yielding, for the moment, to opinions which he hoped to &s;ee exploded, that the decree for the circulation of grain had been altered before the publication, and the u&s;ual preamble, <HI>for &s;uch is our plea&s;ure,</HI> formed a &s;trange contra&s;t with an acknowledge|ment of the legi&s;lative rights of the nation. Robe&s;pierre, particularly maintained, that the nation had not any need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the monarch to con&s;titute it&s;elf&mdash;that the king's reply was not an acceptance, but a cen&s;ure: and, con|&s;equently, an attack on the rights of the people.</P>
<P>This &s;eemed virtually the opinion of the a&s;&s;em|bly, though Mirabeau's &s;oft &s;tyle of expre&s;&s;ing their will was adopted. It was particularly in this deci&s;ion, that the deputies di&s;played a great degree of the weakne&s;s, which mi&s;takes temerity for courage, and the &s;hadow of ju&s;tice for verity. &mdash;And affecting to reconcile a contradiction, that the authority of kings is &s;u&s;pended as often as the &s;overeign is occupied in framing the clements of the con&s;titution, or altering funda|mental laws, they demon&s;trated the incon&s;i&s;tency of their own &s;y&s;tem and acknowledged its ab|&s;urdity; which is &s;till more flagrantly &s;hewn in
<PB N="319" REF="029916_0328_0FE30CEE46A91BD0">
Mirabeau's irrational declaration, that,
<Q>by a pious fiction of the law, the king cannot him|&s;elf deceive; but the grievances of the people demanding victims, the&s;e victims are the mi|ni&s;ters</Q></P>
<P>At this juncture of the debate the tumultuous concour&s;e of women arrived at Ver&s;ailles: but it mu&s;t not be unnoticed, that there was a num|ber of men with them, di&s;gui&s;ed in women's clothes; which proves, that this was not, as has been a&s;&s;erted, a &s;udden impul&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. There were be&s;ides men in their own garb armed like ruffians, with countenances an&s;werable, who, &s;wearing vengeance again&s;t the queen and the body-guards, &s;eemed to be preparing to put their threats in execution. Some barbarians, volun|teers in guilt might perhaps have joined, &s;purred on &s;olely by the hope of plunder, and a love of tumult; but it is clear, that the principal movers played a &s;urer game.</P>
<P>The women had taken two routes; and one party, without arms, pre&s;ented them&s;elves at the gate of the a&s;&s;embly, whil&s;t the other clu&s;tered round the palace waiting for them. The avenues were already filled with body-guards, the Flan|ders regiment was drawn up in ranks; in &s;hort, the &s;oldiers were gathered together quickly in one quarter, though the people of Ver&s;ailles were exceedingly alarmed, and particularly by the appearance of the vagabonds, who followed the female mob.</P>
<P>With &s;ome difficulty the women were pre|vailed on to allow a few to enter orderly into the a&s;&s;embly, with a &s;poke&s;man to make known their demand; whil&s;t crowds, taking refuge in
<PB N="320" REF="029916_0329_0FE30C65D6364B68">
the galleries from the rain, pre&s;ented there the &s;trange &s;ight of pikes, fu&s;ils, and tremendous &s;ticks bound with iron. Their orator repre&s;ented the grievances of the people, and the nece&s;&s;ity of continually providing for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; he expre&s;&s;ed the concern of the Pari&s;ians on account of the &s;low formation of a con&s;titution, and attri|buted this delay to the oppo&s;ition of the clergy A bi&s;hop then pre&s;ided in the ab&s;ence of Mou|nier, the pre&s;ident, who had been di&s;patched by the a&s;&s;embly with their expo&s;tulatory petition to the king. A deputy, to &s;pare him the embarra&s;&s;|ment of a reply to the in&s;inuation again&s;t his order, reprimanded the petitioner for calumniat|ing that re&s;pectable body. He accordingly made an apology, yet ju&s;tified him&s;elf by declaring, that he only reported the purport of the di&s;content|ment of Paris. They were informed, in reply by the vice-pre&s;ident, that a deputation was already &s;ent to the king, reque&s;ting his &s;anction of a de|cree to facilitate the interior circulation of grain and flour: and finding, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, he adjourned the a&s;&s;embly, without waiting for the return of the pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The women about the palace entered into conver&s;ation with the &s;oldiers, &s;ome of whom &s;aid 'that were the king to recover all his 'autho|rity, the people would never want bread! This indi&s;creet in&s;inuation exa&s;perated them; and they replied in the language, that is prover|bial for being the mo&s;t abu&s;ive. A fray al&s;o en&s;uing, brought on by a di&s;pute relative to the affair of the cockades, one of the body guards drew his &s;word, which provoked a national guard
<PB N="321" REF="029916_0330_0FE30CEFDE9D91F8">
of Ver&s;ailles to give him a blow with his mu&s;ket, that broke his arm.</P>
<P>The national troops were eager to convince the mob, that they were equally offended at the di&s;re&s;pect paid to the emblem of liberty; and the Flemi&s;h regiment, though they were in battle array, made the women let their rings drop into their guns, to be convinced that they were not charged: &s;aying,
<Q>It was true, they had drunk the wine of the body guards; but what did that engage them to do? They had al&s;o cried <HI>vive le roi,</HI> as the people them&s;elves did every day; and it was their intention to &s;erve him faithfully,</Q>
but not again&s;t the nation!&mdash; with other &s;peeches to the &s;ame effect;&mdash;adding,
<Q>that one of their officers had ordered a thou|&s;and cockades; and they knew not why they were not di&s;tributed!</Q>
Enraged by the tenor of this di&s;cour&s;e, a body-guards-man &s;truck one of the &s;oldiers talking thus, who, in return, fired on him, and fractured his arm. All was now confu&s;ion; and every thing tended to ren|der the body guards more odious to the po|pulace.</P>
<P>The king arrived in the mid&s;t of it from hunting, and admitted at the &s;ame time the de|putation from the national a&s;&s;embly, and an ad|dre&s;s from the women. He received the latter with great affability, te&s;tified his &s;orrow on ac|count of the &s;carcity of bread at Paris, and imme|mediately &s;anctioned the decree, relative to the free circulation of grain, which he had ju&s;t re|ceived from the a&s;&s;embly.

mo&s;t gentleman-like manner. They immediately rejoined their companions, charmed by the re|ception they had met with; and the king &s;ent orders to the guards not to make u&s;e of their arms. The count d'E&s;taing, the commander in chief, announced likewi&s;e to the militia of Ver|&s;ailles, that the body-guards would the next day take the oath of allegiance to the nation, and put on the patriotic cockade.
<Q>They are not worthy,</Q>
was the indignant growl of the mul|titude.</P>
<P>Some women now returning to Paris, to re|port the gracious behaviour of the king, were unfortunately maltreated by a detachment of body-guards, commanded by a nobleman; and the volunteers of the Ba&s;tile coming to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, two men, and three hor&s;es, were killed on the &s;pot. The&s;e &s;ame irritated wo|men meeting, likewi&s;e, the Pari&s;ian militia, on their way to Ver&s;ailles, gave them an exag|gerated de&s;cription of the conduct of the guards.</P>
<P>The court now taking the alarm, fearing that their plan would be defeated, by the king's being obliged to go to Paris, urged him im|mediately to &s;et out for Metz, and the carriages were actually prepared. It is &s;carcely credible that they would have gone &s;o far without his concurrence.</P>
<P>One loaded coach had been permitted to go out of the gate; but the national troops beginning to &s;u&s;pect what was going forward, obliged it to re-enter. The king then with his u&s;ual addre&s;s, finding his e&s;cape at that time impracticable, and not wi&s;hing to &s;hed blood in forcing his way, made a merit of nece&s;&s;ity, and declared he would

rather peri&s;h, than &s;ee the blood of Frenchmen &s;treaming in his quarrel! So ea&s;y is it for a man, ver&s;ed in the language of duplicity, to impo&s;e on the credulous; and to impre&s;s on candid minds a belief of an opinion that they would gladly re|ceive without any doubting allay, did not other circum&s;tances more &s;trongly contradict the per|&s;ua&s;ion. This declaration, however, which was re-echoed with great eagerne&s;s, was con&s;idered as a manife&s;t proof of the purity of his intentions, and a mark of his fixed adherence to the cau&s;e which he affected to e&s;pou&s;e. Yet, to prove the contrary, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that he put off the acceptance of the declaration of rights, and the fir&s;t articles of the con&s;titution, till after the attempt to e&s;cape was fru&s;trated: for it was near eleven o'clock when he &s;ent for the pre&s;ident, to put into his hands a &s;imple ac|ceptation, and to reque&s;t him to convoke the a&s;&s;embly immediately, that he might avail him|&s;elf of their coun&s;el at this cri&s;is: alarmed by the mob without, who, expo&s;ed to all the inclemen|cy of the weather, it being a very wet and &s;tormy night, were uttering the mo&s;t horrid imprecations again&s;t the queen and the body-guards.</P>
<P>A drum in&s;tantly &s;ummoned the a&s;&s;embly; and La Fayette arriving with his army in le&s;s than an hour after, the pre&s;ident was again call|ed for, who returned to the a&s;&s;embly with the king's a&s;&s;urance, that he had not even thought of leaving them, nor would he ever &s;e|parate him&s;elf from the repre&s;entatives of the people.</P>
<P>La Fayette had previou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured the king of the fidelity of the metropolis, and that he had
<PB N="324" REF="029916_0333_0FE30C7141C8F090">
been expre&s;sly &s;ent by the municipality of Paris to guard his augu&s;t per&s;on. A rumour had pre|vailed, ever &s;ince the arrival of the women, that the Pari&s;ian militia were coming to &s;econd them; but as the <HI>commune</HI> of Paris had not determined till late in the afternoon, the me&s;&s;enger from La Fayette to the palace could not have reached Ver&s;ailles long before him: but the court &s;up|po&s;ing that they would come, and having heard of the wi&s;h of the Pari&s;ians to bring the king to Paris, where they had always &s;pies to give them the earlie&s;t notice of what was going forward, pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;et out without lo&s;s of time; &s;till they were actuated &s;olely by the de&s;ire of getting him away, and not from any apprehen&s;ion that his life was in danger.</P>
<P>After tranquilizing the king, La Fayette join|ed the Pari&s;ian militia in the avenue, to inform them, that the king had &s;anctioned the decree of the a&s;&s;embly for expediting the more &s;pee|dy circulation of provi&s;ions, that he accepted, without any re&s;ervation, of the declaration of rights, with the fir&s;t articles of the con&s;titu|tion, declaring at the &s;ame time his un&s;haken re&s;olution to remain among his people; and that he con&s;ented al&s;o to have a detachment of the national troops of Paris to contribute to guard his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Joy now took place of dread at Ver&s;ailles; and the citizens di&s;tributed their addre&s;&s;es among&s;t the &s;oldiers, offering them lodgings; they having been previou&s;ly reque&s;ted, by the beating of a drum, to receive as many of the Pari&s;ian mili|tia as they po&s;&s;ibly could. The re&s;t, after pa&s;&s;|ing &s;everal hours in arms round the palace,

&s;ought for &s;helter, as the morning began to dawn, in the churches. Every thing appearing quiet, the hara&s;&s;ed king and queen were prevailed on to &s;eek the repo&s;e they needed; and La Fayette, about five in the morning, retired to his chamber, to write to the municipality an account of his proceedings, before he likewi&s;e endeavoured to match a little re&s;t.</P>
<P>Scarcely an hour after, the re&s;tle&s;s mob, great part of which had taken refuge in the hall and galleries of the a&s;&s;embly, began to prowl about. The mo&s;t decent of the women, who had been pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice, &s;tole away during the night. The re&s;t, with the whole gang of ruf|fians, ru&s;hed towards the palace, and finding its avenues unguarded, entered like a torrent; and &s;ome among them, mo&s;t probably, conceived that this was the moment to perpetrate the crime for which they had been drawn from their lurking|holes in Paris.</P>
<P>In&s;ulting one of the body-guards who op|po&s;ed their entrance, he fired and killed a man. This was a fre&s;h pretext for entering to &s;earch for the murderer, as he was termed by the&s;e rioters; and driving the guards before them up the grand &s;tair-ca&s;e, they began to break into the different apartments, vowing vengeance again&s;t the body-guards, in which were mingled the bittere&s;t cur&s;es, all levelled at the queen.</P>
<P>Catching one unfortunate guard by him&s;elf, he was dragged down &s;tairs; and his head, in&s;tantly &s;evered from his body, was mounted on a pike, which rather &s;erved to irritate than glut the fury of the mon&s;ters, who were &s;till hunting after blood or plunder.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="029916_0335_0FE30C7D518565B8">The mo&s;t de&s;perate found their way to the queen's chamber, and left for dead the man who courageou&s;ly di&s;puted their entrance. But &s;he had been alarmed by the tumult, though the mi&s;creants were not long in making their way good, and, throwing a wrapping-gown around her, ran, by a private pa&s;&s;age, to the king's apart|ment, where &s;he found the dauphin; but the king was gone in que&s;t of her: he, however, quickly returning, they waited together in a horrid &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Several of the guards, who en|deavoured to keep back the mob, were wound|ed; yet all this happened in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>The promptitude and rapidity of this move|ment, taking every circum&s;tance into con&s;idera|tion, affords additional arguments in &s;upport of the opinion, that there had been a premeditated de&s;ign to murder the royal family. The king had granted all they a&s;ked the evening be|fore; &s;ending away great part of the multitude delighted with his conde&s;cen&s;ion; and they had received no fre&s;h provocation to excite this out|rage. The audacity of the mo&s;t de&s;perate mob has never led them, in the pre&s;ence of a &s;uperior force, to attempt to cha&s;ti&s;e their governors; and it is not even probable that banditti, who had been moved by the common cau&s;es of &s;uch in|&s;urrections, &s;hould have thought of murdering their &s;overeign who, in the eyes of the greate&s;t number of Frenchmen, was &s;till &s;hrouded by that divinity, tacitly allowed to hover round kings, much le&s;s have dared to attempt it.</P>
<P>La Fayette was quickly rou&s;ed; and, &s;end|ing his <HI>aides-de-camp</HI> to a&s;&s;emble the national-guards,

he followed the ruffians with equal ce|lerity. They had actually forced the king's apartment at the moment he arrived; and the royal family were li&s;tening to the increa&s;ing tu|mult as the harbinger of death,&mdash;when all was hu&s;hed,&mdash;and the door opening in a moment after, the national-guards entered re&s;pectfully, &s;aying they came to &s;ave the king;&mdash;
<Q>and we will &s;ave you too gentlemen,</Q>
added they, addre&s;&s;ing the body-guards, who were in the chamber.</P>
<P>The vagabonds were now pur&s;ued in their turn, and driven from room to room, in the mid&s;t of their pillage, for they had already begun to ran|&s;ack that &s;umptuou&s;ly furni&s;hed palace. From the palace they repaired to the &s;tables, &s;till intent on plunder, and carried away &s;ome hor&s;es, which were as quickly retaken. Every where they pur|&s;ued the body-guards, and every where the generous Pari&s;ian troops, forgetting their piqued pride and per&s;onal animo&s;ity, hazarded their lives to &s;ave them.&mdash;Till, at length, order was per|fectly e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Such was the termination of this mo&s;t my&s;te|rious affair; one of the blacke&s;t of the machina|tions that have &s;ince the revolution di&s;graced the dignity of man, and &s;ullied the annals of huma|nity. Di&s;appointed in their main object, the&s;e wretches beheaded two of the guards, who fell into their hands; and hurried away towards the metropolis, with the <HI>in&s;ignia</HI> of their atrocity on the points of the barbarous in&s;truments of ven|geance&mdash;&s;howing in every in&s;tance, by the dif|ference of their conduct, that they were a &s;et of mon&s;ters, di&s;tinct from the people.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="029916_0337_0FE30CBD6C275840">Whil&s;t nature &s;hudders at imputing to any one a plan &s;o inhuman, the general character and life of the duke of Orleans warrant the belief, that he was the author of this tumult.

<P>It is, perhaps, not the lea&s;t noble faculty of the mind, to que&s;tion the motives of action which are repugnant to the feelings of nature, outraging the mo&s;t &s;acred feelings of the human &s;oul.

the importunities of the duke, who wi&s;hed to vi&s;it England, till the affair blew over. The king, therefore, was prevailed on to give him a nominal commi&s;&s;ion, to be made u&s;e of as a plea to obtain liberty of ab&s;ence from the a&s;&s;embly, of which he was a member.</P>
<P>He was certainly very apprehen&s;ive of an in|ve&s;tigation of the bu&s;ine&s;s; and revenge and am|bition equally giving way to per&s;onal fear, he left his colleagues to fini&s;h the con&s;titution, and his agents to recover his fame, by repre&s;enting the &s;tory as a calumny of the royali&s;ts, again&s;t whom the public were &s;ufficiently enraged to credit any a&s;per&s;ion.</P>
<P>The bold tone he a&s;&s;umed the July following was far from being a proof of his innocence; becau&s;e it was not very probable, that a cunning man &s;hould take his mea&s;ures in &s;uch a critical affair without due precaution.&mdash;On the contrary, he would labour to &s;ink &s;o entirely into the back|ground of the plot, a to render it difficult if not impo&s;&s;ible, for him to be perceived.

<PB N="336" REF="029916_0345_0FE30D32C81FE138">
they had produced the revolution; and thinking them&s;elves both the father and mother of all the great events, which had happened &s;ince its commencement, and that the national a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e conduct indeed betrayed &s;ymptoms of an under&s;tanding not adult, ought to be directed by their leading &s;trings, frequently declared, that liberty would not be &s;ecured, until the court and the a&s;&s;embly were brought within the walls of the capital. This was the &s;ubject of club de|bates, decided with legi&s;lative pompo&s;ity, on the rumour of the intended eva&s;ion of the king; and the in&s;ult offered to the national cockade, the fir&s;t of October, brought them to the deter|mination&mdash;that it was proper he &s;hould be there. &mdash;Such was their will, the capital of the nation &mdash;now &s;overeign. Fore&s;eeing al&s;o, as they had already dreaded, that the only &s;ecurity for infant freedom would be to guard the court, and place in the centre of information their infant repre|&s;entatives; whom they alternately idolized and &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The decorum of manners in a people, long &s;ubordinate to the authority of their magi&s;trates, had on &s;everal occa&s;ions, and even on the fifth of October, controlled the impetuous populace, who had undertaken, or joined in the enterprize; and con&s;idering the manner in which they were pu&s;hed on, it is extraordinary, that they did not commit greater depredations. For with all their brutality, and eagerne&s;s to plunder the palace, they did not attempt to pillage Ver&s;ailles, though half fami&s;hed.</P>
<P>The army of La Fayette indeed, principally compo&s;ed of citizens, behaved not only in an
<PB N="337" REF="029916_0346_0FE30C866B9161A0">
irreproachable manner; but the celerity of their movements, their obedience to the di&s;cipline which they had &s;o promptly acquired, joined to the clemency and moderation they di&s;played, ex|cited the gratitude and re&s;pect of all parties.&mdash; Still, trembling for the rights that had been &s;o gloriou&s;ly &s;natched out of the clinched hand of de&s;poti&s;m&mdash;it was the wi&s;h of all the leaders to have the king at Paris. It was in fact the general &s;entiment at Paris, and of the greater part of the nation.</P>
<P>That city, which had contributed &s;o e&s;&s;entially in effecting the revolution, viewed with anxiety the influence of a party &s;pirit in the a&s;&s;embly, though them&s;elves &s;plit into &s;everal political &s;ects, who almo&s;t execrated each other. And finding that the indeci&s;ion of the members had given fre&s;h hopes to the court, which at la&s;t might render their emancipation merely a dazzling meteor, they were re&s;tle&s;sly bent on having the king and a&s;&s;embly more immediately in their power. The report, likewi&s;e, of Louis's intended e&s;cape; which had he effected, it was probable, that he would have been in the next place prevailed on to join the di&s;con|tented princes and nobles, thus producing a &s;chi&s;m in the kingdom that mu&s;t infallibly have brought on not only a cruel civil war, but have embroiled them with all the different powers of Europe; was a &s;till more urgent motive: for whil&s;t they were con&s;tantly affecting to believe in the goodne&s;s of his heart, they never &s;howed by their conduct, that they had any confidence in his &s;incerity.&mdash;Their opinion of the a&s;&s;embly was equally unfixed.&mdash;One day a deputy was
<PB N="338" REF="029916_0347_0FE30D3449FD9630">
extolled as the hero of liberty, and the next de|nounced as a traiterous pen&s;ioner of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments were dangerous to the au|thority of the new government; but they were &s;entiments which never would have been pro|mulged, even had they exi&s;ted, had the a&s;&s;embly acted with integrity and magnanimity. Becau&s;e, though the people do not always rea&s;on in the mo&s;t logical or rhetorical &s;tyle, yet they generally perceive in what con&s;i&s;ts the defects of their le|gi&s;lators. And in every free government, when the deputies of the &s;tate, convened to form laws, do not act with preci&s;ion and judgment, they will be &s;ure to lo&s;e their re&s;pectability; and the con&s;equence will be a di&s;&s;olution of all au|thority.</P>
<P>It appears to amount to a certainty, that the a&s;&s;embly did not at that time po&s;&s;e&s;s the implicit confidence of the people by their demanding, that the king &s;hould be obliged to re&s;ide within the barriers of the capital.&mdash;It was &s;urely as po&s;&s;ible to guard him at Ver&s;ailles as at Paris; and if it were nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould be kept as a pri|&s;oner of &s;tate, or ho&s;tage, the government was the proper authority to determine how, and where:&mdash;and in giving up this nece&s;&s;ary privi|lege of authority, they &s;urrendered their power to the multitude of Paris.</P>
<P>Or rather a minority of the a&s;&s;embly, who wi&s;hed to be removed to the capital, by exciting and humouring the people, directed the majority; and in the &s;ame manner has the dignity of the repre&s;entative body ever &s;ince been trampled under foot by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or the blind zeal of vanity.&mdash;It is in reality from this epocha, not

forgetting &s;uch a leading circum&s;tance, that the commencement of the reign of anarchy may be fairly dated. For, though a tolerable degree of order was pre&s;erved a con&s;iderable time after, becau&s;e a multitude long accu&s;tomed to &s;ervitude do not immediately feel their own &s;trength; yet they &s;oon began to tyrannize over one part of their repre&s;entatives, &s;timulated by the other. They, however, continued to re&s;pect the decrees of the national a&s;&s;embly e&s;pecially as there were rarely any pa&s;&s;ed on which the public opinion had not been previou&s;ly con&s;ulted, directed as it was by the popular members, who gained their con&s;tant &s;uffrage by the &s;tale trick of crying out for more freedom. It was the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of the de|puties to re&s;pect the dignity of their body.&mdash;In|&s;tead of which for &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es, many of them in&s;tructed the people how to tyrannize over the a&s;&s;embly; thus de&s;erting the main principle of repre&s;entation, the re&s;pect due to the majority. This fir&s;t grand de&s;ertion of the principles, which they affected to adopt in all their purity, led to public mi&s;ery; involving the&s;e &s;hort-&s;ighted men in the very ruin they had them&s;elves produced by their mean intrigues.</P>
<P>The authoritative demand of the Pari&s;ians was &s;triking &s;o directly at the freedom of the a&s;&s;embly, that they mu&s;t either have been con&s;cious of want|ing power, or they had no conception of dig|nity of action, otherwi&s;e they would not have &s;uffered the requi&s;ition of the people to have been complied with.

<P>It is true, &s;uch things are the natural con&s;e|quence of weakne&s;s, the effects of inexperience, and the more fatal errors of cowardice. And &s;uch will always be the effects of timid, injudicious mea&s;ures. Men who have violated the &s;acred feelings of eternal ju&s;tice, except they are harden|ed in vice, are never afterwards able to look hone&s;t men in the face; and a legi&s;lature, watched by an intelligent public, a public that claims the right of thinking for it&s;elf, will never after go beyond it, or pa&s;s one decree which is not likely to be popular.</P>

The progre&s;s of rea&s;on being gradual, it is the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature to advance the &s;implifi|cation of it's political &s;y&s;tem, in a manner be&s;t adapted to the &s;tate of improvement of the un|der&s;tanding of the nation. The &s;udden change which had happened in France, from the mo&s;t &s;ettering tyranny to an unbridled liberty, made it &s;carcely to be expected, that any thing &s;hould be managed with the wi&s;dom of experience: it was morally impo&s;&s;ible. But it is neverthele&s;s a deplorable reflection, that &s;uch evils mu&s;t fol|low every revolution, when a change of politics equally material is required.&mdash;Thus it becomes more peculiarly the duty of the hi&s;torian to re|cord truth; and comment with freedom.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The mob demand the king's removal to Paris. This city de&s;cribed. The king repairs to the capital, e&s;corted by a deputation of the national a&s;&s;embly and the Pari|&s;ian militia. The king's title changed. Proceedings of the national a&s;&s;embly. Reflections on the declaration of rights.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the wild tumult, on the morning of the 6th of October, abated, the king &s;howed him&s;elf to the people, in the balcony, and the queen followed with the dauphin in her arms. At fir&s;t, he vainly attempted to &s;peak; but La Fayette informed the people, that his maje&s;ty came forward to a&s;&s;ure them, that it &s;hould be the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to contribute to the happi|ne&s;s of his people. <HI>The king at Paris,</HI> exclaimed a voice, which was quickly re-echoed by the crowd. 'My children,' replied the king,
<Q>you wi&s;h me to be at Paris, and I will go; but it is on the condition, that my wife and family accompany me.</Q>
A loud &s;hout of <HI>vive le r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i</HI> te&s;tified the ec&s;tacy of the moment. The king made a &s;ign to demand &s;ilence; and then, with tears in his eyes addre&s;&s;ed them again.&mdash;
<Q>Ah! my children, run to the relief of my guards.</Q>
Immediately two or three appeared in the bal|cony with the national cockade in their hats, or the cap of liberty on their heads. The king threw his arms round one of them, and the peo|ple
<PB N="343" REF="029916_0352_0FE30C7ED4ACD0F0">
following his example embraced tho&s;e whom they had taken pri&s;oners in the court. One &s;entiment of gladne&s;s &s;eemed to animate the whole concour&s;e of people; and their &s;en&s;ibility pro|duced as mad demon&s;trations of joy as lately had been di&s;played of ferocity. The &s;oldiery all mingled together, exchanging &s;words, hats, or &s;houlder belts&mdash;exhibiting in the mo&s;t &s;triking manner the prominent features of the French character.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the a&s;&s;embly, in&s;tead of in&s;tantly examining into the particulars of that alarming convul&s;ion, and exerting them&s;elves to cau&s;e a proper re&s;pect to be paid to the &s;overeignty of the law, childi&s;hly gave way to the univer&s;al tran&s;port: in&s;tead of con&s;idering the peremptory wi&s;h of the people to remove the king to Paris as a di&s;tru&s;t of their wi&s;dom, as well as of the veracity of the court, which was in &s;ome mea&s;ure the ca&s;e, they unanimou&s;ly agreed to the motion of Mirabeau, &s;econded by Barnave,
<Q>that the king and a&s;&s;embly &s;hould not be &s;eparated du|ring the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ions.</Q>
Mirabeau, and other popular members, were probably glad to have the per&s;on of the king &s;ecured, without being obliged to appear, in an o&s;ten&s;ible manner, in the affair; becau&s;e they always endeavoured to keep a little hold on the court, whil&s;t they led the people.

Readily then acquie&s;cing in a mea&s;ure the mo&s;t fatal and contemptible, they decreed, that the a&s;&s;embly was in&s;eparable from the per&s;on of the king, and &s;ent a deputation

to inform him of this re&s;olve, previous to his departure.</P>
<P>That Louis, finding all his projects for the pre&s;ent defeated, and after &s;uch a narrow e&s;cape for his life, &s;hould readily have acceded to the demand of the multitude, is not in the lea&s;t ex|traordinary.&mdash;But that the repre&s;entatives of the nation &s;hould, without re&s;i&s;tance or remon&s;trance, have &s;urrendered their authority, and thrown them&s;elves head-long into the heart of a city, which could be &s;uddenly agitated, and put into the mo&s;t di&s;orderly and dangerous commotion, by the intrigues or folly of any de&s;perate or factious leader of the multitude&mdash;&s;uffering them|&s;elves to be environed by it's wall, &s;hut in by it's barriers &mdash;in a word&mdash;choo&s;ing to live in a capa|cious pri&s;on; for men forced, or drawn into any &s;uch &s;ituation, are in reality &s;laves or pri&s;oners, &mdash;almo&s;t &s;urpa&s;&s;es belief. This ab&s;urd conduct, in fact, can be accounted for only by con&s;idering the national character, and the different though equally intere&s;ted views, of the court and popular parties, in the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Independent of the additional incen&s;e of prai&s;e, with which Mirabeau wi&s;hed to be continually regaled, in the metropolis, he had a decided pre|ference for it, frequently a&s;&s;erting, that it was the only place where &s;ociety was truly de&s;ir|able; the people and place, in &s;pite of their vices and follies, equally attaching the ta&s;te they cultivated.</P>

<P>PEOPLE thinking for them&s;elves have more energy in their voice, than any govern|ment, which it is po&s;&s;ible for human wi&s;dom to invent; and every government not aware of this &s;acred truth will, at &s;ome period, be &s;uddenly overturned. Whil&s;t men in a &s;avage &s;tate pre&s;erve their independence. they adopt no regular &s;y&s;tem of policy, nor ever attempt to dige&s;t their rude code of laws into a con&s;titution, to en&s;ure poli|tical liberty. Con&s;equently we find in every country after its civilization has arrived at a cer|tain height, that the people, the moment they are di&s;plea&s;ed with their rulers, begin to clamour again&s;t them; and, finally rejecting all authority but their own will, in breaking the &s;hackles of folly or tyranny, they glut their re&s;entment by the mi&s;chievous de&s;truction of the works of ages, only con&s;idering them as the monuments of their &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>From the &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition of man, in propor|tion as he becomes civilized, he will mingle more and more with &s;ociety. The fir&s;t intere&s;t

he takes in the bu&s;ine&s;s of his fellow-men is in that of his neighbour; next he contemplates the comfort, mi&s;ery, and happine&s;s of the nation to which he belongs, inve&s;tigates the degree of wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice in the political &s;y&s;tem, under which he lives, and, &s;triding into the regions of &s;cience, his re&s;earches embrace all human kind. Thus he is enabled to e&s;timate the portion of evil or good which the government of his coun|try produces, compared with that of others; and the compari&s;on, granting him &s;uperior pow|ers of mind, leads hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to conceive a model of a more perfect form.</P>
<P>This &s;pirit of inquiry fir&s;t manife&s;ts it&s;elf in hamlets; when his views of improvement are confined to local advantages: but the approxi|mation of different di&s;tricts leading to further intercour&s;e, roads of communication are opened, until a central or favourite &s;pot becomes the vor|tex of men and things. Then the ri&s;ing &s;pires, pompous domes, and maje&s;tic monuments, point out the capital; the focus of information, the re&s;ervoir of genius, the &s;chool of arts&punc; the &s;eat of voluptuous gratification, and the hot-bed of vice and immorality.</P>
<P>The centrifugal rays of knowledge and &s;cience now &s;tealing through the empire, the whole intel|lectual faculties of man partake of their influ|ence, and one general &s;entiment governs the civil and political body. In the progre&s;s of the&s;e improvements the &s;tate undergoing a variety of changes, the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery produced occa|&s;ions a diver&s;ity of opinions; and to prevent con|fu&s;ion, ab&s;olute governments have been tolerated by the mo&s;t enlightened part of the people. But,
<PB N="360" REF="029916_0369_0FE30D5FCDDC2050">
probably, this toleration was merely the effect of the &s;trong &s;ocial feelings of men; who prefer|red tranquility, and the pro&s;perity of their coun|try, to a re&s;i&s;tance, which, judging from the ignorance of their fellow citizens, they believed would bring more harm than good in it's train. In &s;hort, however long a combination of tyranny has retarded the progre&s;s, it has been one of the advantages of the large cities of Europe, to light up the &s;parks of rea&s;on, and to extend the prin|ciples of truth.</P>
<P>Such is the good and evil flowing from the capitals of &s;tates, that during the infancy of governments, though they tend to corrupt and enervate the mind, they accelerate the introduc|tion of &s;cience, and give the tone to the national &s;entiments and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>But this influence is extremely gradual; and it requires a great length of time, for the remote corners of the empire to experience either the one, or the other of the&s;e effects. Hence we have &s;een the inhabitants of a metropolis feeble and vitiated, and tho&s;e of the provinces robu&s;t and virtuous. Hence we have &s;een oppo&s;itions in a city (riots as they are called) to illegal govern|ments in&s;tantly defeated, and their leaders hanged or tortured; becau&s;e the judgment of the &s;tate was not &s;ufficiently matured to &s;upport the &s;trug|gle of the unhappy victims in a righteous cau&s;e. And hence it has happened, that the de&s;pots of the world have found it nece&s;&s;ary to maintain large &s;tanding armies, in order to counteract the effects of truth and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The continuation of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, how|ever, for a great length of time, by giving an
<PB N="361" REF="029916_0370_0FE30D1BD38DC878">
overgrown influence to the nobility of France, had contributed, in no &s;mall degree, to counter|act the de&s;poti&s;m of her kings. Thus it was not until after the arbitrary admini&s;tration of Riche|lieu, who had terrified the whole order by a tyranny peculiar to him&s;elf, that the in&s;idious Mazarine broke the independent &s;pirit of the na|tion by introducing the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of honours; and that Louis XIV. by the magnificence of his follies, and the meretricious dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ations of &s;tars, cro&s;&s;es, and other marks of di&s;tinction, or badges of &s;lavery, drew the nobles from their ca&s;tles; and, by concentrating the plea&s;ures and wealth of the kingdom in Paris, the luxury of the court became commen&s;urate to the product of the nation. Be&s;ides, the encouragement given to enervating plea&s;ures, and the venality of titles, purcha&s;ed either with money, or ignoble &s;ervices, &s;oon rendered the nobility as notorious for effeminacy as they had been illu&s;trious for heroi&s;m in the days of the gallant Henry.</P>
<P>The arts had already formed a &s;chool, and men of &s;cience and literature were hurrying from every part of the kingdom to the metropolis, in &s;earch of employment and of honour; and whil&s;t it was giving it's tone to the empire, the Pari&s;ian ta&s;te was pervading Europe.</P>
<P>The vanity of leading the fa&s;hions, in the higher orders of &s;ociety, is not the &s;malle&s;t weak|ne&s;s produced by the &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s into which people of quality naturally fall.

<P>A confederacy of philo&s;ophers, who&s;e opinions furni&s;hed the food of colloquial entertainment, gave a turn for in&s;tructive and u&s;eful reading to the leaders of circles, and drew the attention of the nation to the principles of political and civil government. Whil&s;t by the compilation of the Encyclopedia, the repo&s;itory of their thoughts, as an ab&s;tract work, they eluded the dangerous vigilance of ab&s;olute mini&s;ters; thus in a body di&s;&s;eminating tho&s;e truths in the economy of

finance, which, perhaps they would not have had &s;ufficient courage &s;eparately to have produced in individual publications; or, if they had, they would mo&s;t probably have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This is one of the few in&s;tances of an a&s;&s;ocia|tion of men becoming u&s;eful, in&s;tead of being cramped by joint exertions. And the cau&s;e is clear:&mdash;the work did not require a little party &s;pirit; but each had a di&s;tinct &s;ubject of inve&s;ti|gation to pur&s;ue with &s;olitary energy. His de&s;ti|nation was traced upon a calm &s;ea, which could not expo&s;e him to the Scylla or Charybdis of vanity or intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The economi&s;ts, carrying away the palm from their opponents, &s;howed that the pro&s;perity of a &s;tate depends on the freedom of indu&s;try; that talents &s;hould be permitted to find their level; that the un&s;hackling of commerce is the only &s;ecret to render it flouri&s;hing, and an&s;wer more effectually the ends for which it is politi|cally nece&s;&s;ary; and that the impo&s;ts &s;hould be laid upon the &s;urplus remaining, after the hu&s;|bandman has been reimbur&s;ed for his labour and expences.</P>
<P>Ideas &s;o new, and yet &s;o ju&s;t and &s;imple, could not fail to produce a great effect on the minds of Frenchmen; who, con&s;titutionally attached to novelty and ingenious &s;peculations, were &s;ure to be enamoured with a pro&s;pect of con&s;olidating the great advantages of &s;uch a novel and enlightened &s;y&s;tem; and without calculating the danger of attacking old prejudices; nay, without ever con|&s;idering, that it was a much ea&s;ier ta&s;k to pull down than to build up, they gave them&s;elves little trouble to examine the gradual &s;teps by which
<PB N="364" REF="029916_0373_0FE30D688F84C358">
other countries have attained their degree of political improvement.</P>
<P>The many vexatious taxes, which under the French government not only enervated the exer|tions of unprivileged per&s;ons, &s;tagnating the live &s;tream of trade, but were extremely tea&s;ing in|conveniences to every private man, who could not travel from one place to another without being &s;topped at barriers, and &s;earched by offi|cers of different de&s;criptions, were almo&s;t in&s;u|perable impediments in the way of the improve|ments of indu&s;try. and the abridgment of liberty was not more grievous in its pecuniary con&s;e|quences, than in the per&s;onal mortification of being compelled to ob&s;erve regulations as trou|ble&s;ome as they were at variance with &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>Irritations of the temper produce more poig|nant &s;en&s;ations of di&s;gu&s;t than &s;erious injuries. Frenchmen, indeed, had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to the&s;e vexatious forms, that, like the ox who is daily yoked, they were no longer galled in &s;pirit, or exhaled their angry ebullitions in a &s;ong. Still it might have been &s;uppo&s;ed, that after re|flecting little, and talking much, about the &s;ubli|mity and &s;uperior excellence of the plans of <HI>French</HI> writers above tho&s;e of other nations, they would become as pa&s;&s;ionate for liberty, as a man re&s;trained by &s;ome idle religious vow is to po&s;&s;e&s;s a mi&s;tre&s;s, to who&s;e charms the imagination has lent all its own world of graces.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the very manner of living in France gives a lively turn to the character of the people; for by the de&s;truction of the animal juices, in dre&s;&s;ing their food, they are &s;ubject to none of
<PB N="365" REF="029916_0374_0FE30D1D55345C28">
that dulne&s;s, the effect of more nutritive diet in other countries; and this gaiety is increa&s;ed by the moderate quantity of weak wine, which they drink at their meals, bidding de&s;iance to phlegm. The people al&s;o living entirely in villages and towns are more &s;ocial; &s;o that the tone of the capital, the in&s;tant it had a note di&s;tinct from that of the court, became the key of the nation; though the inhabitants of the provinces poli&s;hed their manners with le&s;s danger to their morals, or natural &s;implicity of character. But this mode of peopling the country tended more to civilize the inhabitants, than to change the face of the &s;oil, or lead to agricultural improvements. For it is by re&s;iding in the mid&s;t of their land, that farmers make the mo&s;t of it, in every &s;en&s;e of the word&mdash; &s;o that the rude &s;tate of hu&s;bandry, and the awk|wardne&s;s of the implements u&s;ed by the&s;e inge|nious people, may be imputed &s;olely to this cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of France was likewi&s;e very fa|vourable for collecting the information acquired in other parts of the world. Paris, having been made a thoroughfare to all the kingdoms on the con|tinent, received in its bo&s;om &s;trangers from every quarter; and it&s;elf re&s;embling a full hive, the very drones buzzed into every corner all the &s;entiments of liberty, which it is po&s;&s;ible for a people to po&s;&s;e&s;s, who have never been en|lightened by the broad &s;un&s;hine of freedom; yet more romantically enthu&s;ia&s;tic, probably for that very rea&s;on. Paris, therefore, having not only di&s;&s;eminated information, but pre&s;ented her&s;elf as a bulwark to oppo&s;e the de&s;poti&s;m of the court, &s;tanding the brunt of the fray, &s;eems with &s;ome

rea&s;on, to pride her&s;elf on being the author of the revolution.</P>
<P>Though the liberty of the pre&s;s had not exi&s;t|ed in any part of the world, England and Ame|rica excepted, &s;till the di&s;qui&s;ition of political que&s;tions had long occupied the intelligent parts of Europe; and in France, more than in any country, books written with licentious freedom were handed from hou&s;e to hou&s;e with the cir|cum&s;pection that irritates curio&s;ity. Not to lay great &s;tre&s;s on the univer&s;ality of the language, which made one general opinion on the benefits ari&s;ing from the advancement of &s;cience and rea|&s;on pervade the neighbouring &s;tates, particularly Germany; where original compo&s;itions began to take place of that laborious erudition, which being employed only in the elucidation of ancient writers, the judgment lies dormant, or is merely called into action to weigh the import of words rather than to e&s;timate the value of things. In Paris, likewi&s;e, a knot of ingenious if not pro|found writers, twinkled their light into every circle; for being care&s;&s;ed by the great, they did not inhabit the homely rece&s;&s;es of indigence, ru&s;ticating their manners as they cultivated their under&s;tandings; on the contrary, the fine&s;&s;e re|quired to convey their free &s;entiments in their books, broken into the &s;mall &s;hot of innuendoes, gave an oiline&s;s to their conver&s;ation, and en|abled them to take the lead at tables, the volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s of which was grateful to philo&s;ophers, rather of the epicurean than the &s;toic &s;ect.</P>
<P>It had long been the fa&s;hion to talk of liberty, and to di&s;pute on hypothetical and logical points

of political economy; and the&s;e di&s;putations di&s;|&s;eminated gleams of truth, and generated more demagogues than had ever appeared in any mo|dern city.&mdash;The number exceeded, perhaps, any compari&s;on with that of Athens it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The habit al&s;o of pa&s;&s;ing a part of mo&s;t of their evenings at &s;ome theatre, gave them an ear for harmony of language, and a fa&s;tidious ta&s;te for &s;heer declamation, in which a &s;entimental jargon extingui&s;hes all the &s;implicity and fire of pa&s;&s;ion; the great number of play-hou&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are upwards of thirty &s;cattered throughout the city.</NOTE>, and the moderate prices of the pit and different ranges of boxes, bringing it within the compa&s;s of every citizen to frequent the amu&s;ement &s;o much be|loved by the French.</P>
<P>The arrangement of &s;ounds, and the adju&s;t|ment of ma&s;culine and feminine rhymes, being the &s;ecrets of their poetry, the pomp of diction gives a &s;emblance of grandeur to common ob&s;er|vations and hackneyed &s;entiments; becau&s;e the French language, though copious in the phra&s;es that give each &s;hade of &s;entiment, has not, like the Italian, the Engli&s;h, the German, a phra&s;eo|logy peculiar to poetry; yet its happy turns, equivocal, nay even conci&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, and nu|merous epithets, which, when ingeniou&s;ly appli|ed, convey a &s;entence, or afford matter for half a dozen, make it better adapted to oratorical flouri&s;hes than that of any other nation. The French therefore are all rhetoricians, and they have a &s;ingular fund of &s;uperficial knowledge, caught in the tumult of plea&s;ure from the &s;hallow
<PB N="368" REF="029916_0377_0FE30D6A114B8168">
&s;tream of conver&s;ation; &s;o that if they have not the depth of thought which is obtained only by contemplation, they have all the &s;hrewd|ne&s;s of &s;harpened wit; and their acquirements are &s;o near their tongue's end, that they never mi&s;s an opportunity of &s;aying a pertinent thing, or tripping up, by a &s;mart retort, the arguments with which they have not &s;trength fairly to wre&s;tle.</P>
<P>Every political good carried to the extreme mu&s;t be productive of evil; yet every poi&s;on has its antidote; and there is a pitch of luxury and refinement, which, when reached, will overturn all the ab&s;olute governments in the world. The a&s;certainment of the&s;e antidotes is a ta&s;k the mo&s;t difficult; and whil&s;t it remains imperfect, a num|ber of men will continue to be the victims of mi&s;taken applications. Like the empirics, who bled a patient to death to prevent a mortification from becoming fatal, the tyrants of the earth have had recour&s;e to cutting off the heads, or torturing the bodies, of tho&s;e per&s;ons who have attempted to check their &s;way, or doubt their omnipotence. But, though thou&s;ands have pe|ri&s;hed the victims of empirics, and of de&s;pots, yet the improvements made both in medicine and moral philo&s;ophy have kept a &s;ure, though gradual pace.&mdash;And, if men have not clearly di&s;covered a &s;pecific remedy for every evil, phy|&s;ical, moral, and political, it is to be pre&s;umed, that the accumulation of experimental facts will greatly tend to le&s;&s;en them in future.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t, therefore, the &s;umptuous galas of the court of France were the grand &s;ource of the re|finement of the arts, ta&s;te became the antidote

to <HI>ennui;</HI> and when &s;entiment had taken place of chivalrous and gothic tournaments, the reign of philo&s;ophy &s;ucceeded that of the imagination. And though the government, enveloped in pre|cedents, adju&s;ted &s;till the idle ceremonials, which were no longer impo&s;ing, blind to the impercep|tible change of things and opinions, as if their faculties were bound by an eternal fro&s;t, the pro|gre&s;s was invariable; till, reaching a certain point, Paris, which from the particular formation of the empire had been &s;uch an u&s;eful head to it, began to be the cau&s;e of dreadful calamities, ex|tending from individuals to the nation, and from the nation to Europe. Thus it is, that we are led to blame tho&s;e, who, in&s;i&s;t, that, becau&s;e a &s;tate of things has been productive of good, it is always re&s;pectable; when, on the contrary, the endeavouring to keep alive any hoary e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, beyond its natural date, is often per|nicious and always u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>In the infancy of governments, or rather of civilization, courts &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;ary to accele|rate the improvement of arts and manners, to lead to that of &s;cience and morals. Large capi|tals are the obvious con&s;equences of the riches and luxury of courts; but as, after they have arrived at a certain magnitude and degree of re|finement, they become dangerous to the freedom of the people, and incompatible with the &s;afety of a republican government, it may be que&s;tioned whether Paris will not occa&s;ion more di&s;turbance in &s;ettling the new order of things, than is equi|valent to the good &s;he produced by accelerating the epocha of the revolution.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="029916_0379_0FE30D6BAD922340">However, it appears very certain, that &s;hould a republican government be con&s;olidated, Paris mu&s;t rapidly crumble into decay. Its ri&s;e and &s;plendor were owing chiefly, if not entirely, to the old &s;y&s;tem of government; and &s;ince the foundation of its luxury has been &s;haken, and it is not likely that the di&s;parting &s;tructure will ever again re&s;t &s;ecurely on its ba&s;is, we may fairly infer, that in proportion as the charms of &s;olitary reflection and agricultural recreations are felt, the people, by leaving the villages and cities, will give a new complexion to the face of the country&mdash;and we may then look for a turn of mind more &s;olid, principles more fixed, and a conduct more con|&s;i&s;tent and virtuous.</P>
<P>The occupations and habits of life have a won|derful influence on the forming mind; &s;o great, that, the &s;uperinductions of art &s;top the growth of the &s;pontaneous &s;hoots of nature, till it is dif|ficult to di&s;tingui&s;h natural from factitious morals and feelings; and as the energy of thinking will always proceed, in a great mea&s;ure, either from our education or manner of living, the frivolty of the French character may be accounted for, with|out taking refuge in the old hiding place of ig|norance&mdash;occult cau&s;es.</P>
<P>When it is the object of education, to prepare the pupil to plea&s;e every body, and of cour&s;e to deceive, accompli&s;hments are the one thing need|ful; and the de&s;ire to be admired ever being uppermo&s;t, the pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ubjugated, or all drawn into the whirlpool of egoti&s;m <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I u&s;e this word according to the French acceptation, becau&s;e we have not one to expre&s;s &s;o forcibly the &s;ame &s;ignification.</NOTE>.

gives to each per&s;on, however different the tem|per, a tincture of vanity, and that weak vacilla|tion of opinion, which is incompatible with wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we term character.</P>
<P>Thus a Frenchman, like mo&s;t women, may be &s;aid to have no character di&s;tingui&s;hable from that of the nation; unle&s;s little &s;hades, and ca&s;ual lights, be allowed to con&s;titute an e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tic. What then could have been ex|pected, when their ambition was mo&s;tly confined to dancing gracefully, entering a room with ea&s;y a&s;&s;urance, and &s;miling on and complimenting the very per&s;ons whom they meant to ridicule at the next fa&s;hionable a&s;&s;embly? The learning to fence with &s;kill it is true, was u&s;eful to a people, who&s;e fal&s;e notions of honour required that at lea&s;t a drop of blood &s;hould atone for the &s;hadow of an affront. The knack al&s;o of uttering &s;prightly repartees became a nece&s;&s;ary art, to &s;upply the place of that real intere&s;t only to be nouri&s;hed in the affectionate intercour&s;e of do|me&s;tic intimacy, where confidence enlarges the heart it opens. Be&s;ides, the de&s;ire of eating of every di&s;h at table, no matter if there were fifty, and the cu&s;tom of &s;eparating immediately after the repa&s;t, de&s;troy the &s;ocial affections, remind|ing a &s;tranger of the vulgar &s;aying&mdash;'every man for him&s;elf, and God for us all.' After the&s;e cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations, it is not going too far to advance, that the French were in &s;ome re&s;pects the mo&s;t unqualified of any people in Europe to undertake the important work in which they are embarked.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t plea&s;ure was the &s;ole object of living among the higher orders of &s;ociety, it was the

bu&s;ine&s;s of the lower to give life to their joys, and convenience to their luxury. This ca&s;t-like divi&s;ion, by de&s;troying all &s;trength of character in the former, and deba&s;ing the latter to ma|chines, taught Frenchmen to be more ingenious in their contrivances for plea&s;ure and &s;how, than the men of any other country; whil&s;t, with re&s;pect to the abridgment of labour in the me|chanic arts, or to promote the comfort of com|mon life, they were far behind. They had never, in fact, acquired an idea of that independent, comfortable &s;ituation, in which contentment is &s;ought rather than happine&s;s; becau&s;e the &s;laves of plea&s;ure or power can be rou&s;ed only by lively emotions and extravagant hopes.

<P>A change of character cannot be &s;o &s;udden as &s;ome &s;anguine calculators expect: yet by the de&s;truction of the rights of primogeniture, a greater degree of equality of property is &s;ure to follow; and as Paris cannot maintain its &s;plen|dor, but by the trade of luxury, which can never be carried to the &s;ame height it was for|merly, the opulent having &s;trong motives to in|duce them to live more in the country, they mu&s;t acquire new inclinations and opinions.&mdash;As a change al&s;o of the &s;y&s;tem of education and dome&s;tic manners will be a natural con&s;equence of the revolution, the French will in&s;en&s;ibly ri&s;e to a dignity of character far above that of the pre&s;ent race; and then the fruit of their liberty,

<P>Since the exi&s;tence of courts, who&s;e aggran|di&s;ement has been con&s;picuous in the &s;ame de|gree as the mi&s;eries of the deba&s;ed people have accumulated, the convenience and comfort of men have been &s;acrificed to the o&s;tentatious di&s;|play of pomp and ridiculous pageantry. For every order of men, from the beggar to the king, has tended to introduce that extravagance into &s;ociety, which equally bla&s;ts dome&s;tic virtue and happine&s;s. The prevailing cu&s;tom of living be|yond their income has had the mo&s;t baneful effect on the independence of individuals of every cla&s;s in England, as well as in France; &s;o that whil&s;t they have lived in habits of idlene&s;s, they have been drawn into exce&s;&s;es, which, proving ruinous, produced con&s;equences equally perni|cious to the community, and degrading to the private character. Extravagance forces the peer to pro&s;titute his talents and influence for a place, to repair his broken fortune; and the country gentleman becomes venal in the &s;enate, to enable him&s;elf to live on a par with him, or reimbur&s;e him&s;elf for the expences of electioneering, into which he was led by &s;heer vanity. The profe&s;|&s;ions, on the &s;ame account, become equally un|principled. The one, who&s;e characteri&s;tic ought to be integrity, de&s;cends to chicanery; whil&s;t another tri&s;les with the health, of which it

knows all the importance. The merchant like|wi&s;e enters into &s;peculations &s;o clo&s;ely bordering on fraudulency, that common &s;traight forward minds can &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;h the devious art of &s;elling any thing for a price far beyond that nece&s;&s;ary to en&s;ure a ju&s;t profit, from &s;heerdi&s;|hone&s;ty, aggravated by hard-heartedne&s;s, when it is to take advantage of the nece&s;&s;ities of the indigent.</P>
<P>The de&s;tructive influence of commerce, it is true, carried on by men who are eager by over|grown riches to partake of the re&s;pect paid to nobility, is felt in a variety of ways. The mo&s;t pernicious, perhaps, is it's producing an ari&s;to|cracy of wealth, which degrades mankind, by making them only exchange &s;avagene&s;s for tame &s;ervility, in&s;tead of acquiring the urbanity of im|proved rea&s;on. Commerce al&s;o, over&s;tocking a country with people, obliges the majority to be|come manufacturers rather than hu&s;bandmen; and then the divi&s;ion of labour, &s;olely to enrich the proprietor, renders the mind entirely inactive. The time which, a celebrated writer &s;ays, is &s;auntered away, in going from one part of an em|ployment to another, is the very time that pre|&s;erves the man from degenerating into a brute; for every one mu&s;t have ob&s;erved how much more intelligent are the black&s;miths, carpenters, and ma&s;ons in the country, than the journeymen in great towns; and, re&s;pecting morals there is no making a compari&s;on. The very gait of the man, who is his own ma&s;ter, is &s;o much more &s;teady than the &s;louching &s;tep of the &s;ervant of a fer|vant, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k which proves
<PB N="378" REF="029916_0387_0FE30C6221FE29E8">
by his actions he has the mo&s;t independence of character.</P>
<P>The acquiring of a fortune is likewi&s;e the lea&s;t arduous road to pre-eminence, and the mo&s;t &s;ure: thus are whole knots of men turned into machines, to enable a keen &s;peculator to become wealthy; and every noble principle of nature is eradicated by making a man pa&s;s his life in &s;tretching wire, pointing a pin, heading a nail, or &s;preading a &s;heet of paper on a plain &s;urface. Be&s;ides, it is allowed, that all a&s;&s;ociations of men render them &s;en&s;ual, and con&s;equently &s;elfi&s;h; and whil&s;t lazy friars are driven out of their cells as &s;tagnate bodies that corrupt &s;ociety, it may admit of a doubt whether large work-&s;hops do not contain men equally tending to impede that gradual progre&s;s of improvement, which lead<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the per|fection of rea&s;on, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of rational equality.</P>
<P>The deprivation of natural, equal, civil and political rights, reduced the mo&s;t cunning of the lower orders to practi&s;e fraud, and the re&s;t to habits of &s;tealing, audacious robberies, and mur|ders. And why? becau&s;e the rich and poor were &s;eparated into bands of tyrants and &s;laves, and the retaliation of &s;laves is always terrible. In &s;hort, every &s;acred feeling, moral and divine, has been obliterated, and the dignity of man &s;allied, by a &s;y&s;tem of policy and juri&s;prudence as repugnant to rea&s;on as at variance with hu|manity.</P>
<P>The only excu&s;e that can be made for the fero|city of the Pari&s;ians is then &s;imply to ob&s;erve, that they had not any confidence in the laws,

which they had always found to be merely cob|webs to catch &s;mall flies. Accu&s;tomed to be puni&s;hed them&s;elves for every trifle, and often for only being in the way of the rich, or their para|&s;ites; when, in fact, had the Pari&s;ians &s;een the execution of a noble, or prie&s;t, though convicted of crimes beyond the daring of vulgar minds?&mdash; When ju&s;tice, or the law, is &s;o partial, the day of retribution will come with the red &s;ky of ven|geance, to confound the innocent with the guilty. The mob were barbarous beyond the tiger's cruelty: for how could they tru&s;t a court that had &s;o often deceived them, or expect to &s;ee it's agents puni&s;hed, when the &s;ame mea&s;ures were pur&s;uing?</P>
<P>Let us ca&s;t our eyes over the hi&s;tory of man, and we &s;hall &s;carcely find a page that is not tar|ni&s;hed by &s;ome foul deed, or bloody tran&s;action. Let us examine the catalogue of the vices of men in a &s;avage &s;tate, and contra&s;t them with tho&s;e of men civilized; we &s;hall find, that a barbarian, con&s;idered as a moral being, is an angel, compared with the refined villain of artificial life. Let us inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es which have produced this degeneracy, and we &s;hall di&s;cover, that they are tho&s;e unju&s;t plans of governments, which have been formed by peculiar circum&s;tances in every part of the globe.&mdash;Then let us coolly and impar|tially contemplate the improvements, which are gaining ground in the formation of principles of policy; and I flatter my&s;elf it will be allowed by every humane and con&s;iderate being, that a po|litical &s;y&s;tem more &s;imple than has hitherto ex|i&s;ted would effectually check tho&s;e a&s;piring follies, which, by imitation, leading to vice, have bani&s;h|ed

from governments the very &s;hadow of ju&s;tice and magnanimity</P>
<P>Thus had France grown up, and &s;ickened on the corruption of a &s;tate di&s;ea&s;ed. But, as in medicine there is a &s;pecies of complaint in the bowels which works it's own cure, and, leaving the body healthy, gives an invigorated tone to the &s;y&s;tem, &s;o there is in politics; and whil&s;t the agitation of it's regeneration continues, the ex|crementitious humours exuding from the con|taminated body will excite a general di&s;like and contempt for the nation; and it is only the phi|lo&s;ophical eye, which looks into the nature and weighs the con&s;equences of human actions, that will be able to di&s;cern the cau&s;e, which has pro|duced &s;o many dreadful effects.</P>
