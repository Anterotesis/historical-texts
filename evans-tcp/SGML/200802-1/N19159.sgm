<HEAD>IN obedience to two re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, one of the 21&s;t in&s;tant, directing the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury to report a plan for the redemp|tion of &s;o much of the Public Debt, as by the Act, intituled, "An Act making provi&s;ion for the debt of the United States," the United States have re&s;erved the right to redeem&mdash;the other of the 22nd in&s;tant, directing him to report the plan of a provi&s;ion for the reimbur&s;ement of the Loan made of the Bank of the United States, pur&s;uant to the 11th &s;ection of the Act, intituled, "An Act to incorporate the Sub&s;cribers to the Bank of the United States,"&mdash;The &s;aid Secretary re&s;pect|fully &s;ubmits the following Report.</HEAD>
<P>THE expediency of taking mea&s;ures for the regular redemption of the Public Debt, according to the right which has been re&s;erved to the go|vernment, being wi&s;ely predetermined, by the re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives referring the &s;ubject to the Secretary, nothing remains for him, but to endeavour to &s;elect and &s;ubmit the mo&s;t eligible means of providing for the execution of that important object.</P>
<P>With this view, the fir&s;t enquiry, which naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf, is, whether the exi&s;ting revenues are, or are not, adequate to the purpo&s;e?&mdash;</P>
<P>The e&s;timates which accompany the report of the Secretary of the 14th in&s;t. will &s;hew, that during the continuance of the pre&s;ent Indian war, the appro|priations for intere&s;t and the demands for the current &s;ervice are likely to ex|hau&s;t the product of the exi&s;ting revenues; though they afford a valuable &s;ur|plus beyond the permanent objects of expenditure, which, it is hoped, may ere long be advantageou&s;ly applied to accelerate the extingui&s;hment of the debt.</P>
<P>In the mean time however, and until the re&s;toration of peace, the employ|ment of that re&s;ource, in this way, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;u&s;pended&mdash;and either the bu&s;ine&s;s of redemption mu&s;t be deferred, or recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to other expedients.</P>
<P>But did no &s;uch temporary nece&s;&s;ity, for re&s;orting to other expedients, exi&s;t, the doing of it would &s;till be recommended by weighty con&s;iderations. It would appear, in the ab&s;tract, advi&s;eable, to leave the &s;urplus of the pre&s;ent revenues free, to be applied to &s;uch ca&s;ual exigencies as may from to time oc|cur&mdash;to occa&s;ional purcha&s;es of the debt when not exhau&s;ted by &s;uch exigen|cies, to the payment of intere&s;t on any balances, which may be found due to particular &s;tates, upon the general &s;ettlement of accounts, and finally to the payment of intere&s;t on the deferred part of the debt, when the period for &s;uch payment arrives. There is a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect, that if not diverted, it will be found adequate to the two la&s;t important purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Relinqui&s;hing then the idea of an immediate application of the pre&s;ent reve|nues to the object in view&mdash;it remains to examine what other modes are in the option of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Loans, from time to time, equal to the &s;ums annually redeemable, and bot|tomed on the &s;ame revenues, which are now appropriated to pay the intere&s;t upon tho&s;e &s;ums, offer them&s;elves as one expedient, which may be employed with a degree of advantage. As there is a probability of borrowing at a lower rate of intere&s;t, a material &s;aving would re&s;ult; and even this re&s;ource, if none better could be devi&s;ed, ought not to be neglected.</P>
<P>But it is obvious, that to rely upon this re&s;ource alone would be to do little towards the final exoneration of the nation. To &s;top at that point would con|&s;equently
<PB N="2" REF="024927_0004_0FCD8E90000E7B08">
be neither provident nor &s;atisfactory. The intere&s;ts as well as the expectations of the Union require &s;omething more effectual.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of additional revenues is the remaining re&s;ource. This, if the bu&s;ine&s;s is to be undertaken in earne&s;t, is unavoidable. And a full con|fidence may rea&s;onably be entertained, that the community will &s;ee with &s;atis|faction the employment of tho&s;e means, which alone can be effectual, for ac|compli&s;hing an end, in it&s;elf &s;o important, and &s;o much an object of general de&s;ire. It cannot fail to be univer&s;ally felt, that if the end is to be attained, the nece&s;&s;ary means mu&s;t be employed.</P>
<P>It can only be expected that care be taken to choo&s;e &s;uch as are liable to fewe&s;t objections, and that in the modifications of the bu&s;ine&s;s in other re&s;|pects, due regard be had to the pre&s;ent and progre&s;&s;ive circum&s;tances of the country.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uming it as the ba&s;is of a plan of redemption, that additional revenues are to be provided, the further enquiry divides it&s;elf into the following branches:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Shall a revenue be immediately con&s;tituted, equal to the full &s;um which may at pre&s;ent be redeemed, according to the terms of the contract?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Shall a revenue be con&s;tituted from year to year, equal only to the in|tere&s;t of the &s;um to be redeemed in each year, coupling with this operation an annual loan, commen&s;urate with &s;uch &s;um?&mdash;Or,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Shall a revenue be con&s;tituted each year, &s;o much exceeding the inte|re&s;t of the &s;um to be redeemed, as to be &s;ufficient, within a &s;hort definite term of time, to di&s;charge the principal it&s;elf; coupling with this operation al&s;o, an annual loan, equal to the &s;um to be annually redeemed, and appropriating the revenue created to its di&s;charge, within the term which &s;hall have been pre|determined?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The fir&s;t plan, be&s;ides being completely effectual, would be eventually mo&s;t oeconomical; but con&s;idering to what a magnitude the revenues of the United States have grown in a &s;hort period, it is not ea&s;y to pronounce how far the faculty of paying might not be &s;trained by any &s;udden con&s;iderable augmenta|tion, where&s;oever immediately placed; while the rapid progre&s;s of the coun|try in population and re&s;ource &s;eems to afford a moral certainty, that the ne|ce&s;&s;ary augmentation may be made with convenience, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;teps, with|in a moderate term of time&mdash;and invites to temporary and partial &s;u&s;pen&s;ions, as capable of conciliating the rea&s;onable accommodation of the community with the vigorous pro&s;ecution of the main de&s;ign. For the&s;e, and for other rea&s;ons which will readily occur, the cour&s;e of providing immediately the in|tire &s;um to be redeemed, is conceived <HI>not</HI> to be the mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>The &s;econd plan, though much more efficacious than that of annual loans, bottomed on the revenues now appropriated for the payment of intere&s;t on the &s;ums to be redeemed, does not appear to be &s;ufficiently efficacious. The &s;che|dule A. will &s;hew the effect of it to the 1&s;t of January 1802, when the deferred debt will become redeemable in the proportions &s;tipulated. Suppo&s;ing the in|ve&s;tment of the intere&s;t which is each year liberated, together with that which has been, and will be relea&s;ed by purcha&s;es, pur&s;uant to provi&s;ions heretofore made, in the purcha&s;e of 6 per cent. &s;tock; a &s;um of principal equal to 2,043,837 dollars and 7 cents would be &s;unk, and a clear annuity, equal to 459,212 dollars and 82 cents would be created, towards further redemptions; but the fund then nece&s;&s;ary for the future progre&s;&s;ive redemption of the debt, according to the right re&s;erved, would be 1,126,616 dollars and 44 cents, exceed|ing by 667,!
 403 dollars and 62 cents, the amount of the redeeming fund.&mdash;Something more effectual than this is certainly de&s;irable, and appears to be practicable.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="024927_0005_0FCD8E916E09FED8">
The la&s;t of the three plans be&s;t accords with the mo&s;t accurate view, which the Secretary has been able to take of the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>In its application, it is of material con&s;equence to endeavour to accompli&s;h the&s;e two points: 1&s;t. The complete di&s;charge of the &s;ums annually redeem|able, within the period prefixed, and the reimbur&s;ement, within the &s;ame pe|riod, of all auxiliary loans, which may have been made for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;2ndly. The con&s;tituting, by the expiration of that period, a clear annual fund competent to the future redemption of the debt, to the extent of the right re&s;erved.</P>
<P>The period, to which it is conceived the plan ought to refer, is the 1&s;t day of January 1802; becau&s;e <HI>then</HI> the fir&s;t payment, on account of the principal of the deferred debt, may rightfully be made.</P>
<P>In conformity to the&s;e ideas, the following plan is mo&s;t re&s;pectfully &s;ubmit|ted; premi&s;ing, that the &s;um redeemable for the fir&s;t year of the 6 per cent. &s;tock, bearing a pre&s;ent intere&s;t, is computed at 550,000 dollars.</P>

<P>The &s;chedule C will exhibit the means of con&s;tituting the &s;everal annuities propo&s;ed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed.

The&s;e, whenever they can be brought into action, will be important aids, materially accelerating the ultimate redemption of the intire debt&mdash;The employment of the&s;e re&s;ources, when it can be done, by encrea&s;ing the intere&s;t-fund, will proportionably le&s;&s;en the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing the re&s;ource of taxation for creating the propo&s;ed annuities;&mdash;if the government &s;hall judge it advi&s;eable to avail it&s;elf of the &s;ub&s;titute, which may accrue from that circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Having now given a general view of the plan, which has appeared upon the whole the mo&s;t eligible, it is nece&s;&s;ary in the next place to pre&s;ent to the con|&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e the requi&s;ite funds for commencing the execution of it. The&s;e will embrace a provi&s;ion for the fir&s;t annuity only; that alone re|quiring by the plan immediate provi&s;ion. With regard to a provi&s;ion for the &s;ub&s;equent annuities, which is propo&s;ed to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ive, the Secretary will con|tent him&s;elf with this general ob&s;ervation, that he di&s;cerns no intrin&s;ic diffi|culty
<PB N="6" REF="024927_0008_0FCD8E98F4793A40">
in making provi&s;ion for them, as fa&s;t as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary, with, due con|venience to the people, and con&s;i&s;tently with the idea of ab&s;taining from taxing lands and buildings (with the &s;tock and implements of farms) re&s;erv|ing them as a re&s;ource for tho&s;e great emergencies, which call for a full exer|tion of all the contributive faculties of a country.</P>
<P>The following means for con&s;tituting the fir&s;t annuity, are re&s;pectfully &s;ub|mitted, viz.</P>
<P>Annual &s;urplus of the dividend on the &s;tock of government in the bank of the United States, beyond the intere&s;t to be paid out of the &s;aid dividend, e&s;|timated at 60,000 dollars.</P>
<P>Tax on hor&s;es, kept or u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of riding, or of drawing any coach, chariot, phaeton, chai&s;e, chair, &s;ulkey or other carriage for <HI>conveyance of per&s;ons;</HI> excepting and exempting all hor&s;es, which are <HI>u&s;ually</HI> and <HI>chiefly</HI> employed for the purpo&s;es of hu&s;bandry, or in drawing waggons, wains, drays, carts or other carriages, for the tran&s;portation of produce, goods, mer|chandize and commodities, or in carrying burthens in the cour&s;e of the trade or occupation of the per&s;ons to whom they re&s;pectively belong, and the hor|&s;es of per&s;ons in the military &s;ervice of the United States, viz.</P>
<P>For every hor&s;e, not above excepted and exempted, at the rate of one dollar per annum&mdash;where only one is u&s;ed or kept by the &s;ame per&s;on, with an addition of fifty cents per annum per hor&s;e, where more than one and not more than two hor&s;es are kept or u&s;ed by the &s;ame per&s;on&mdash;with an addition of one dollar per annum per hor&s;e, where more than two, and nor more than four are kept or u&s;ed by the &s;ame per&s;on, and with an addition of one dollar and a half dollar per hor&s;e, per annum, where more than four are kept or u&s;ed by the &s;ame per&s;on: Provided that this addition &s;hall not be made in re&s;pect to hor&s;es u&s;ually employed in public &s;tages for the conveyance of pa&s;|&s;engers.</P>
<P>This progre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of rates on the higher numbers has reference to the pre&s;umption of greater wealth, which ari&s;es from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch higher numbers.</P>
<P>The products of this tax will probably be about equal to the re&s;idue of the propo&s;ed annuity, which is 43,199 dollars and 6 cents. How near the truth this e&s;timate may prove, experiment alone can, in &s;o untried a ca&s;e, decide.&mdash;An aid to this fund may be derived from the &s;urplus dividend on the bank &s;tock, for the half year ending the la&s;t of December next, which it is pre&s;u|med will be not le&s;s than 20,000 dollars. Should a deficiency appear upon trial, it can be &s;upplied by a future provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Proper regulations for the collection of this tax will, it is believed, be found not difficult, if the tax it&s;elf &s;hall be deemed eligible. Its &s;implicity has been a con&s;iderable recommendation of it. Qualified as it is, it is not likely to fall on any but &s;uch who can afford to pay it. The exemption from the tax, in regard to hor&s;es which are appropriated to the purpo&s;es of <HI>hu&s;bandry,</HI> or of any trade or occupation, or to the tran&s;portation of commodities, &s;eems to obviate all rea&s;onable objection.</P>
<P>If, however, there &s;hould appear to the legi&s;lature, rea&s;ons for preferring a tax on carriages for plea&s;ure, which, it may be ob&s;erved, will operate on nearly the &s;ame de&s;cription of per&s;ons, the &s;um required may, it is believed, be produced from the following arrangement of rates, viz. Upon every coach, the annual &s;um of four dollars.&mdash;Upon every chariot, the annual &s;um of three dollars.&mdash;Upon every other carriage <HI>for the conveyance of per&s;ons,</HI> having four wheels, the annual &s;um of two dollars;&mdash;and upon every chair, &s;ulkey or other carriage <HI>for the conveyance of per&s;ons,</HI> having le&s;s than four wheels, the annual &s;um of one dollar.</P>
<P>The collection of this tax will be as &s;imple and ea&s;y, and perhaps more cer|tain, than that which has been primarily &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="024927_0009_0FCD8E9A6C0253B0">
With regard to the &s;econd object referred to the Secretary, namely, the plan of a provi&s;ion for the reimbur&s;ement of the loan made of the bank of the United States, pur&s;uant to the XIth &s;ection of the act by which it is incorpo|rated;&mdash;the following is re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted, (to wit,) That power be given by law to borrow the &s;um due, to be applied to that reimbur&s;ement; and that &s;o much of the dividend on the &s;tock of the government in the bank as may be nece&s;&s;ary, be appropriated for paying the intere&s;t of the &s;um to be borrowed.</P>
<P>From this operation, it is obvious, that a &s;aving to the government will re|&s;ult, equal to the difference between the intere&s;t which will be payable on the the new loan, and that which is payable on the &s;um now due to the bank. If the propo&s;ed loan can be effected, at the rate of tho&s;e la&s;t made in Holland, the nett &s;aving to the government may be computed at the annual &s;um of 35,000 dollars; which &s;aving, whatever it may be, is contemplated as part of the means for con&s;tituting the propo&s;ed annuities.</P>
<P>The benefit of this arrangement will be accelerated, if provi&s;ion be made for the application of the proceeds of any loans, heretofore obtained, to the payment &s;ugge&s;ted on the condition of re-placing the &s;ums which may be &s;o applied out of the proceeds of the loan or loans, which &s;hall be made pur|&s;uant to the power above propo&s;ed to be given.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o conduce to the general end in view, if the legi&s;lature &s;hall think proper to authori&s;e the inve&s;tment of the funds, de&s;tined for purcha&s;es of the debt, in purcha&s;es of 6 per cent. &s;tock at the market price, though above par. The comparative prices of the &s;everal kinds of &s;tock have been, and frequent|ly may be, &s;uch as to render it more profitable to make inve&s;tments in the 6 per cents, than in any other &s;pecies of &s;tock.</P>
