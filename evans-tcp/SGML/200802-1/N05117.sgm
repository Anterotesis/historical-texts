<P>For, for this Cau&s;e pay you Tribute al&s;o: for they are GOD's Mini&s;ters, attending con|tinually upon this very Thing.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>civil Government</HI> is &s;o obvious to any One, that con&s;iders the State &amp; Circum&s;tan|ces of the World, that we may conclude, None will de&s;pi&s;e Go|verment, but &s;uch unhappy Per&s;ons, who&s;e <HI>Minds &amp; Con&s;ciences are defiled,</HI> and them&s;elves unto every <HI>good Work reprobate; walking after their own Lu&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>FOR, as in the Days when <HI>there was no King in I&s;rael, and every Man did that which was right in his own Eyes,</HI> (Judg. 21.25.) Judg|ment departed from them, and all evil Works &amp; Confu&s;ions prevail'd among&s;t; them; So will it be among&s;t every People where there is no Government. <HI>Judgment will turn away back|ward, and Ju&s;tice &s;tand afar off</HI> from &s;uch a People: <HI>Truth will fail, and he that departeth from Evil,</HI> will <HI>make him&s;elf a Prey.</HI> The <HI>Feet</HI> of Multitudes will <HI>run to Evil,</HI> and <HI>they make

haste to &s;hed innocent Blood. Wa&s;ting and De|&s;truction</HI> will indeed be in <HI>their Paths</HI>; and all manner of Oppre&s;&s;ions prevail among them. The Prophe&s;ie concerning <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> would &s;oon be the ju&s;t Character of Multitudes, that He &s;hould <HI>be a wild Man, his Hand again&s;t every Man, &amp; every Man's Hand again&s;t him,</HI> (Gen. 16.12.)</P>
<P>BUT yet, there have aro&s;e, even among&s;t them that pretend to <HI>approve Things that are excel|lent,</HI> and <HI>to believe on the Name of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, &s;ome that <HI>de&s;pi&s;e Dominion, &amp; &s;peak evil of Dignities,</HI> (Jude 7.) Under a <HI>Pretence</HI> of Liberty, <HI>fal&s;ly &s;o called,</HI> they would <HI>put down all Rule, &amp; all Authority, &amp; Power</HI> among Men: Pleading in Defence of their licentious Doctrine, that CHRIST <HI>hath made all his Peo|ple Kings; and they &s;hall reign on the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>THIS they pretend is the <HI>Liberty where with Christ have made them free.</HI> They pretend to believe, that the <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> of the Church of Chri&s;t depends upon the De&s;truction of all <HI>temporal</HI> Powers; and that the <HI>golden Age</HI> of the Church, and the expected <HI>Millennium</HI> is to be introduced by weakning the Power of the Princes of this World, and &s;etting Men upon a <HI>Level.</HI> And therefore have &s;ometimes been called by the Name of <HI>Levellers.</HI></P>

<PB N="3" REF="006430_0006_1028E8B54E253358">
<HI>Paul</HI> hath written concerning thrift <HI>chri&s;tian Liberty,</HI> that he was a Friend to <HI>Anarchy,</HI> &mdash; and coun|cenanced &s;uch <HI>Levelling Principles,</HI> He treats particularly upon civil Government in this Chapter: Shewing the <HI>divine In&s;titution</HI> and <HI>Appointment,</HI> the <HI>U&s;e &amp; De&s;ign</HI> of it; and the great <HI>Work</HI> &amp; <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of tho&s;e that are intru&s;ded with the Admini&s;tration thereof: Declaring al&s;o, that GOD him&s;elf requires Obedience and Subjection to the Same.</P>
<P>HE injoins <HI>that every Soul be &s;ubjeft unto the higher Powers,</HI> [or the Authority placed over them] <HI>For there is no Power,</HI> &s;aith He, <HI>but of</HI> GOD, [the Fountain of it:] <HI>The Powers that be are ordained of</HI> GOD, v.1.</P>
<P>HE is &s;o far from countenancing Di&s;obe|dience to Authority, that he declares, as v.2. <HI>Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of</HI> GOD: <HI>and they that re&s;ist, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves Damnation.</HI> To re&s;i&s;t the Government, in the Admini&s;tration of that Power GOD hath committed to them, is as it were to wage War again&s;t GOD him&s;elf, and to renounce <HI>His</HI> Government, by whom <HI>Princes rule, &amp; Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth,</HI> (Prov. 8.16.) And therefore the Children of Rebellion have Rea&s;on to expect that GOD him&s;elf will ari&s;e to plead his Cau&s;e, and vindi|cate his Authority; that He will <HI>&s;peak to them in his Wrath, &amp; vex them in his &s;ore Di&s;plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006430_0007_1028E8BB1A4572D8">THE Apo&s;tle al&s;o pre&s;&s;eth Subjection to Au|thority from the <HI>Original Intention</HI> &amp; <HI>Design</HI> of Government, which is the <HI>publick Good.

Rulers acting by the Authority of GOD, (and <HI>there is no Power but of</HI> GOD) are not a Di&s;couragement to <HI>good works, but to the evil</HI>: They are not de&s;ign'd to di&s;courage any Thing, that tends to promote the Welfare of the World, but only to be a Terrour to &s;uch Works, as bring a Cur&s;e upon the World, and hurt the In|tere&s;ts of Men. They are armed with Autho|rity &amp; Power, to prepare <HI>Judgments for Scor|ners, and Stripes for the Back of Fools</HI>; to <HI>&s;catter the Wicked, and bring the Wheel over them,</HI> (Prov 19.29. &amp; 20.26.) Let Men but lead <HI>a peaceable &amp; quiet Life in all Godline&s;s &amp; Hone&s;ty,</HI> and the Magi&s;trate, as GOD's Vicegerent, will do them no Hurt; but will rather protect and incourage them.</P>
<P>AND therefore &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, in the latter Part of v.3, &amp; Beginning of v.4. <HI>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou &s;halt have Prai&s;e of the &s;ame: For he is the Mini&s;ter of</HI> GOD <HI>to thee for Good.</HI> Magi&s;trates are deputed &amp; delegated to act for GOD: He gives them Power &amp; Authority to incourage the Vertuous; to <HI>maintain their Right and Cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006430_0008_1028E8BCD9A36A60">INDEED, if Men <HI>are contentious, and do not o|bey the Truth, but obey Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> they have Rea&s;on to be afraid of the Magi&s;trate's Power: And therefore &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, in the latter Part of v.4. <HI>But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain: for he is the Mini&s;ter of</HI> GOD, <HI>a revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doeth evil.</HI> They are as it were armed with GOD's <HI>Sword of Ju&s;tice,</HI> and mu&s;t weild it for Him. GOD hath made them his <HI>Officers</HI> not only to incourage the Vertuous, but to execute Puni&s;hments &amp; Wrath upon them that do evil.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, v.5 <HI>Ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for Wrath, but al&s;o for Con&s;cience Sake.</HI> I.E. Not only for Fear of Pu|ni&s;hment from the Magi&s;trate, but out of Con|&s;cience and Duty; becau&s;e <HI>&s;o is the Will of</HI> GOD,(1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.15.)</P>
<P>FOR, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle in our <HI>Text, for this Cau&s;e pay you Tribute al&s;o: for they are GOD's Mini&s;ters, attending continually upon this very Thing.</HI> Q. D.

<P>THE <HI>Text,</HI> I think will naturally lead us, to con&s;ider the following Things, <HI>agreeable</HI> to the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of this Day.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>Authority by which the civil Powers rule.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>great Ends &amp; De&s;igns of civil Go|vernment, and the great Work &amp; Bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e that are intru&s;ted with the Admini&s;tration thereof.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III THE <HI>Obligations upon a People to Sup|port Government.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. IN <HI>the first Place,</HI> let us con&s;ider <HI>the Au|thority by which the civil Powers rule.</HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Text</HI> tells us, <HI>They are</HI> GOD's <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible indeed, there is a Di&s;tinction between the <HI>&s;upreme Powers,</HI> and <HI>inferiour Magi&s;trates,</HI> commi&s;&s;ion'd by them, according to 1 Pet. 2.13, 14 <HI>Submit your &s;elves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's &s;ake: Whether it be to the King, as &s;upreme; or unto Governours, as unto them that are &s;ent by him for the Puni&s;hment of evil Doers, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do Well.</HI></P>
<P>BUT alth&ocirc; there are various <HI>Degrees</HI> &amp; Or|ders of Men intru&s;ted with the administration of Government, and the lower Orders <HI>imme|diately</HI> derive their Authority from tho&s;e above
<PB N="7" REF="006430_0010_1028E8C321213380">
them, yet they all <HI>ultimately</HI> derive their Au|thority from GOD; are <HI>His</HI> Mini&s;ters, and rule for <HI>Him.</HI> And therefore 'tis &s;aid, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.15, 16. <HI>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice. By me Princes rule, ana Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>As in Kingdoms &amp; particular Governments, all Power <HI>de&s;cends,</HI> from the &s;upreme Au|thority upon &s;ubordinate Magi&s;trates &amp; Offi|cers; &s;o in the univer&s;al Monarchy of the World, all lawful Power &amp; Authority is deri|ved from GOD, the <HI>&s;upreme Lord</HI> of the World. And, th&ocirc; the Derivation of this Authority be <HI>mediate,</HI> and Men are in <HI>various</HI> Ways intro|duced thereunto, according to the diver&s;e Con|&s;titutions of Kingdoms, States &amp; Governments; yet &s;till the <HI>Authority</HI> by which they rule is from GOD, the <HI>Head &amp; Fountain</HI> of all Do|minion and Authority.</P>
<P>'Tis the <HI>most High</HI> that rules in the King|doms of Men by the Mini&s;try of <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI>: And they mini&s;ter as in <HI>His</HI> Name, and by Authority and Commi&s;&s;ion from <HI>Him</HI>: And therefore they are &s;tiled <HI>Gods,</HI> P&s;al. 82.6. <HI>I have &s;aid, Ye are Gods: and all of you are Children of the most High.</HI></P>
<P>ALL Government belongs <HI>originally</HI> unto GOD him&s;elf; but he deputes &s;ome of the <HI>Sons</HI> of Men to act for <HI>Him</HI>; ve&s;ts them with <HI>His</HI> Au|thority, and charges them, as 2 Chron. 19.6. <HI>Take
<PB N="8" REF="006430_0011_1028E8C6151FBAE8">
Heed what ye do: for ye judge not for Man, but for the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>BUT we proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2">II. IN <HI>the &s;econd Place, The great Ends and De&s;ign of civil Government, and the great Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e intru&s;ted with the Admi|ni&s;tration thereof.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>in general,</HI> we may &s;ay, that the <HI>publick Good</HI> is the great End, and <HI>original De&s;ign</HI> of the In&s;titution of civil Government. It was ordain'd as a <HI>Means</HI> to promote the <HI>Peace</HI> &amp; <HI>Welfare</HI> of the World; to guard &amp; defend the Innocent, &s;helter and relieve the Oppre&s;&s;ed, in|courage the Vertuous, and di&s;courage Vice &amp; Wickedne&s;s: And <HI>This</HI> is the great Thing civil Rulers are <HI>continually to attend upon.</HI></P>
<P>POWER is given to them from <HI>above,</HI> to the <HI>End</HI> they may <HI>incourage</HI> &s;uch Things as pro|mote the <HI>Welfare</HI> of Mankind, &amp; may &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch Things as are <HI>injurious</HI> to the World. A <HI>Sword</HI> is put into their Hands for the <HI>Protection</HI> of them that <HI>do Well,</HI> and the <HI>Cha&s;ti&s;ements</HI> of <HI>evil Doers.</HI> Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. ONE <HI>End &amp; De&s;ign</HI> of civil Government, and &s;o <HI>Part of the Work &amp; Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of tho&s;e that are <HI>intru&s;ted</HI> with the Admini&s;tration thereof, is, <HI>to maintain the publick Peace.</HI> Peace &amp; Quietne&s;&s; is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Well|Being of any People. 'Tis a <HI>fundamental</HI> Thing in all Governments, without which none
<PB N="9" REF="006430_0012_1028E8C9421E5008">
of the other Ends of Government can be &s;ecu|red, nor it &s;elf <HI>long</HI> &s;upported. A <HI>Kingdom di|vided against it &s;elf cannot &s;tand,</HI> (Mar. 3.24.)</P>
<P>AND then, where Men can't live quietly, they can't live happily. <HI>Broils</HI> &amp; <HI>Contention</HI> will render any Society of People unhappy, and over&s;pread the whole Face thereof with Con|fu&s;ion &amp; Mi&s;ery. 'Tis better dwelling alone in a Wilderne&s;s, than in the Mid&s;t of Contentions &amp; Quarrels, where <HI>Fire-Brands, Arrows &amp; Death</HI> are ca&s;t about. David in &s;uch a Ca&s;e wi&s;h'd for <HI>Wings</HI> &s;wift as a <HI>Dove</HI> to <HI>flie away far off</HI> to &s;ome Place of Safety &amp; Repo&s;e, <HI>Psal</HI> 55.7, 8, 9.</P>
<P>BUT now, without Government there would be endle&s;s <HI>Broils</HI> &amp; <HI>Strifes, Wars</HI> &amp; <HI>Fightings.</HI> To prevent which, the GOD <HI>of Peace</HI> hath or|dain'd Government in the World. And Rulers are Mini&s;ters of GOD to <HI>re&s;train the Wrath</HI> of Men, to curb in that Spirit of Di&s;cord, &s;o ready to prevail on <HI>all</HI> Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>IT can't be expected but that there will be &s;ome <HI>turbulent</HI> &amp; <HI>contentious</HI> Men among every People; unruly &amp; fierce, inclin'd to improve every Opportunity to &s;et People together by the Ears, and &s;catter the Seeds of Di&s;cord, and violate the Laws of Peace: Now Government is de&s;ign'd to re&s;train <HI>&s;uch,</HI> that People may <HI>lead quiet &amp; peaceable Lives.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly; ANOTHER <HI>End</HI> of civil Government, and &s;o <HI>Part of the Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of civil Rulers, is, <HI>to
<PB N="10" REF="006430_0013_1028E8CB2C0A2798">
protect Men in the Enjoyment or their just Rights and Privileges, both natural &amp; acquired, civil &amp; religious.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL not exerci&s;e your Patience, to con&s;i|der the various <HI>natural</HI> &amp; <HI>acquired, civil</HI> &amp; <HI>tem|poral Rights &amp; Privileges</HI> of Men; which they ju&s;tly value &amp; e&s;teem, and could not &s;ecurely po&s;&s;els without the Protection of Government: It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, before an Auditory <HI>&s;o well</HI> acquainted with the Rights &amp; Privileges of Man|kind, that the great GOD, who <HI>loveth Righ|teou&s;ne&s;fs,</HI> hath in&s;tituted Government for the &s;ecuring of Men in the Enjoyment of the&s;e their Rights and Privileges.</P>
<P>IF there were none in Authority, but every Man was left to do what was right in his own Eyes, there would be <HI>no</HI> &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of any Thing. Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s would &s;oon for&s;ake the Earth; Rapine &amp; Violence, Fal&s;hood &amp; Oppre&s;&s;ion would every where pre|vail &amp; triumph, and tho&s;e <HI>that turn Judgment to Wormwnood; and leave off Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Earth</HI> be multiplied. Neither Promi&s;es nor Bonds would avail Strength of Arm would be the only <HI>Law of Ju&s;tice</HI> obtaining and acknowleged among Men.</P>
<P>FOR the maintaining of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Judgment therefore in the Earth, is Govern|ment &s;et up. And therefore GOD charges his Mini&s;ters intru&s;ted with the Admini&s;tration
<PB N="11" REF="006430_0014_1028E8D3E046C970">
thereof, to <HI>execute Judgment &amp; Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and deliver the &s;poiled out of the hand of the Oppre&s;&s;or,</HI> and to <HI>let Judgment run down as Wa|ters, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s as a mighty Stream,</HI> (Jer. 22.3. Amos 5.24)</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides our temporal Rights, we have our <HI>Spiritual</HI> Ones, as <HI>we are Members of the Body of Christ</HI>; even the invaluable <HI>Privileges of the Go&s;pel</HI>: Which, if they &s;hould be taken from us, <HI>what have</HI> we more!</P>
<P>AND yet, there may be Men di&s;pos'd to take the&s;e from us; who, if unre&s;train'd would <HI>&s;pread forth their Hands upon all our plea&s;ant Things</HI>; drive us from the Hou&s;e of the LORD, or di&s;turb us in our Wor&s;hip there; <HI>break down the carved Work</HI> of the Hou&s;e of GOD, or <HI>cast Fire into his Sanctuary.</HI></P>
<P>GOVERNMENT is therefore al&s;o de&s;ign'd to protect Men in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;piritual Privileges. And therefore 'tis &s;aid concerning Zion, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 49.23. <HI>Kings &s;hall be thy nur&s;ing Fathers, and their Queens thy nur&s;ing Mothers.</HI> They are to be Guardians of the Religion, as well as the civil Rights &amp; Liberties of their People.</P>
<P N="3">3dly; ANOTHER great <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of Govern|ment, and &s;o what Men <HI>intru&s;ted</HI> with the Admi|ni&s;tration thereof are continually to attend up|on, is, to <HI>incourage Men in well Doing.</HI> The A|po&s;tle &s;aith in v.3, of our Context, <HI>Do that which
<PB N="12" REF="006430_0015_1028E8D573B4C548">
is good, and thou &s;halt have Prai&s;e of the &s;ame,</HI> i.e. Of the Powers and Rulers.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT is appointed to incourage &amp; promote univer&s;al Righteou&s;ne&s;s &amp; Goodne&s;s; that Men might live not only peaceably and hone&s;tly, but <HI>religiou&s;ly</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>THERE hath indeed been a great Cry of <HI>late</HI> Years, that the civil Magi&s;trate hath Nothing to do about religious Matters, nor ought to make any Laws for the Incouragement of Re|ligion and Protection of the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> But this is <HI>new</HI> Doctrine to the Church of Chri&s;t: Which hath always expected that <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> Kings &s;hould be it's <HI>nur&s;ing Fathers,</HI> and <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> Queens it's <HI>nur&s;ing Mothers.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, whil&s;t the civil Powers remain'd <HI>E|nemies to the Cro&s;s of</HI> CHRIST, nor acknow|leged <HI>Him</HI> their Head &amp; King, the Churches expected no great Help from them.

And &s;urely it becomes us to &s;upport that, which is of <HI>divine Appointment.</HI> Surely, as GOD <HI>him&s;elf</HI> hath rai&s;ed Rulers on high for the good of Men, We are oblig'd, to do all we properly can, to &s;upport their Dignity, and maintain their Character.</P>
<P N="2">2dly; AN Obligation on us, to endeavour to &s;upport Government, ari&s;es from <HI>the great Ne|ce&s;&s;ity and Benefit of it to the World.</HI></P>
<P>As the State of our World is, Government is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for it's Well-Being; and there could be no tolerable Living without it: And therefore GOD hath in <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> to Man|kind, appointed Government for their own Good, that they <HI>may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</HI> As therefore we de&s;ire the <HI>Welfare</HI> of Mankind; as we de+&s;ire the Ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>Peace, Godline&s;</HI> &amp; <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> it concerns us to &s;upport Government.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, All, that wi&s;h well to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> will be Friends to Government; for; 'tis the <HI>ordinary</HI> Means GOD makes u&s;e of, to &s;upport his Church in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="006430_0041_1028E91960C13160">INDEED, He, that is anointed King in <HI>Zion</HI> is able to protect his Church, if earthly Powers &s;hould de&s;ert it, and willingly &s;ee it labouring under all imaginable Di&s;couragements, yea, ra&s;ed to the Foundation.</P>
<P>AND therefore, when the civil Powers were Per&s;ecutors of the Truth, as in the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity; when they refus'd to exert their Power to protect the Church, and defend the Faith, yea, rather imploy'd their Power to pull down and de&s;troy the &s;ame, yet the Church was upheld, to the Admiration &amp; a&s;toni&s;hing Confu&s;ion of her Enemies. The Lord alone was her Defence. As the Rulers of the World knew him not, his own almighty Arm, in a miraculous Way, br&ocirc;t Salvation to his People.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince Chri&s;tianity is become the Reli|gion of many Nations, and &s;o many Princes have laid down their Scepters at the Feet of Chri&s;t, and as it were taken out their Com|mi&s;&s;ions from Him, he is plea&s;ed to make the&s;e Powers his Mini&s;ters to protect his Church.</P>
<P>AND we may conclude, that, if among&s;t the chri&s;tian Nations, their Rulers will not favour <HI>Zion,</HI> it is a Day of the Lord's Di&s;plea&s;ure with his People, and that the Lord is plea&s;ed to take away their Hedge and their Defence: And therefore we may expect, that it will be <HI>a Day of treading down in the Valley of Vi&s;ion,</HI> and of <HI>breaking down the Wells</HI> of Zion; Her <HI>Glory

<P>ALMOST any, even a <HI>tyrannous</HI> Government is better than none; becau&s;e, while the Govern|ment is never &s;o tyrannical, there are but a few cxerci&s;ing that Tyranny: The Multitude are in

the mean Time under Re&s;traint.

<P>THE Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions of Men are &s;uch, that if entirely left loo&s;e, to them&s;elves, without any Re&s;traint of Govcrnment, the World it &s;elf would &s;carce be a habitable Place, but rather a confu&s;ed Scene of Intemperance, Lewdne&s;s, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Robbery, Murder, and all Manner of Exorbitances. <HI>By Reafon of the Multitude cf Oppre&s;&s;ions, they</HI> would <HI>make the Oppre&s;&s;ed to crie; Violence and Spoil</HI> would be <HI>heard</HI> in the Mid&s;t of them, and <HI>Grief and Wounds</HI> be <HI>conti|nually before</HI> them.

<P>'Tis Matter therefore of great Thankfulne&s;s, when any are favour'd with a <HI>legal</HI> well con&s;ti|tuted Government, &s;uch as that of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions, perhaps the be&s;t in any, of the Nations of the Earth.</P>
<P>IT is therefore Matter of Wonder, that &s;o many, who have &s;at fo <HI>&s;ecurely</HI> under the Sha|dow of &s;o <HI>excellent</HI> a Government, and enjoy'd &s;o many <HI>Liberties</HI> and valuable <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> under the Same, have been di&s;pos'd to rebel, and to exchange &s;o <HI>good</HI> a Government for <HI>Bondage</HI> and <HI>Slavery.</HI></P>
