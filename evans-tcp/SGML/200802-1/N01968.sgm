<PB N="5" REF="002339_0009_0FDB2BEF17AA0B60">
of the Tran&s;actions&punc; excepted.</HI>) Dr. MATHER did indeed &s;end, A <HI>Letter to the Phy&s;icians in the City of Bo&s;ton,</HI> and directed it to One of them, a Worthy Schoolma&s;ter, (whom we did not reproach for going out of his Line for prac|ti&s;ing Phy&s;ick.) This he de&s;ired to be communicated to them; and, <HI>Sawny,</HI> your honourable <HI>Name</HI> was particularly in|&s;erted, and principally in the Direction. But he never &s;ent a particular or &s;eperate Epi&s;tle to <HI>Ev'ry One,</HI> as you mu&s;t mean, or otherwi&s;e exclude your &s;elf from the Number of <HI>Practitioners.</HI> Indeed, he wrote a <HI>&s;eparate Note</HI> to one or two, but no more; with another Copy of his Letter to you, for fear they &s;hould be overlook'd among them. Be&s;ides, <HI>Sawny,</HI> this <HI>General Letter</HI> it &s;elf was not directed to ALL, there was <HI>&s;ome</HI> he had no thoughts of, as he told the Per&s;on by whom he de&s;ir'd it might be Communicated.</P>

<P>But now for the other Sentence, (<HI>The Owner of the Tran&s;actions excepted</HI>;) Truth! it is &s;omewhat hard, that the Dr. &s;hould affront your honour &s;o much, as to di|rect the Letter to any but your &s;elf, when you know there is not a Phy&s;ician in the Town, that ought to be named the &s;ame Day with you. But however, Ma&s;ter <HI>Sawny,</HI> he in&s;erted <HI>your Name in particular</HI>; and de&s;ired <HI>expre&s;sly,</HI> that they would not forget YOU. And notwith&s;tanding you are &s;o given over to <HI>Lying,</HI> and &s;o <HI>brazen</HI> in it, as to &s;ay over again, that the DOCTORS <HI>Probity</HI> in his Abrig|ment could not be concluded from his Addre&s;&s;ing it to tho&s;e who had the <HI>Original</HI> in their Hands; For &s;ay you the Truth is, he &s;ent his <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> to <HI>all</HI> the Noted Phy&s;icians in the Town, but not to the <HI>Owner</HI> of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> and then cry out <HI>Proh Fides</HI>! Ah <HI>Sawny, Proh Fides,</HI> &s;ure enough! But now for t'other Pa&s;&s;age; You &s;ay Dr. MATHER, <HI>invited them to come into the Practice of Inoculating the Small-Pox.</HI> And before this in the News-Letter, <HI>He applied to the Practitioners of the Place, to put this far fetcht, and not well voucht Method into Practice.</HI> But to &s;ee how far all this is true, I'le re|cite the Conclu&s;ion of his <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> to the Physicians, wherein the World may &s;ee his un&s;potted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ocence, and uncommon Charity.

you rail at Dr. BOYLESTON, for propagating the <HI>In|fection of the Small-Pox,</HI> and in a few lines after &s;ay, <HI>the Ino|culation produces nothing analogous to the Small-Pox</HI>: here is ignorance and incon&s;i&s;tency too!

<P>THe <HI>Author</HI> of this <HI>language</HI> is one MUNDUNGUS; who tho' he moves in the dark, and &s;moaky Sphere of a <HI>Tobacco-Cellar,</HI> has a very <HI>diffu&s;ive</HI> Light; and has lately ble&s;&s;ed the whole Country, with two Superlatively excellent, and <HI>matchle&s;s</HI> Treati&s;es; in which we may ven|ture to &s;ay, he hath &s;et the Scriptures in a very <HI>new Light</HI>: and di&s;covered a profound knowledge in the <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sci|ences.</HI> This his <HI>Language</HI> is without controver&s;y very <HI>nice</HI> and curious: And we know none &s;o proper to be declared, the <HI>Univer&s;al Language.</HI> And &s;ince he has &s;o honoured this part of the World, as fir&s;t to impart it to <HI>us</HI>; we humbly conceive, &s;ome public <HI>marks</HI> of Honour ought to be conferred upon him: and we propo&s;e, that he be pre|ferred <HI>Pro&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> of <HI>it,</HI> among the <HI>Sons of Harvard</HI>; his <HI>Language</HI> be inrolled into the Number of the <HI>learned Tongues,</HI> and his <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> be pre&s;erved as a Valuable <HI>Cu|rio&s;ity</HI> in the <HI>Library</HI>; tho' two or three pages of it, we think ought to be exactly tran&s;cribed and &s;ent to <HI>Peters|burgh</HI> as a <HI>Key</HI> to the 3 Volumes, lately carried there by the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Travellers. And further, <HI>whither</HI> he &s;hould not be con&s;tituted <HI>Cen&s;or</HI> of the Age, and <HI>Imprimator</HI> of the Pre&s;s? And be de&s;ired, to write a <HI>Spelling-Book,</HI> for the u&s;e of the <HI>Schools</HI> &s;ince he has rendered STRONG and WATTS, &amp;c. altogether u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>And &s;ince <HI>it</HI> is &s;o <HI>Rhetorical</HI> and per&s;ua&s;ive, we move that, he be the <HI>Prolocutor</HI> in all public A&s;&s;emblies, and A&s;&s;ociations of the <HI>People.</HI> And now, &s;ince we have enter|ed his Prai&s;es, we can't pa&s;s by his profound skill in <HI>Logic,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 line">

be ordained <HI>Moderator</HI> of all di&s;putes, controver&s;ies, and <HI>publick Acts.</HI> He is al&s;o very expert in <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> and Medicine, and can by two principles alone, i. e. <HI>Sempeti</HI> and <HI>Anthepeti</HI> explain the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ecrets of Nature; therefore we propo&s;e that an <HI>Infirmary</HI> be erected for him, that &s;o he may <HI>Head</HI> all the <HI>Invalids</HI> in the Country: tho' pro|bably the new Brick <HI>Edifice</HI> in the <HI>Common,</HI> may do for the pre&s;ent. He has al&s;o di&s;cover'd &s;o great a knowledge in <HI>Divinity</HI> that we move he be elected CONSCIENCE-KEEPER-GENERAL of the Country; and all Ca&s;es of difficulty be referred to him; and if any MINISTER &s;hall meddle without his Liberty, it &s;hall be deemed <HI>a going out of his line,</HI> and he &s;hall be obliged to pay <HI>fourfold</HI> for the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r'd</HI> Breeches. And whereas his Skill in <HI>Politicks</HI> is &s;o very profound, as with one <HI>&s;ingle glance</HI> to di&s;cover the Origin of all <HI>State Differences,</HI> &amp;c. we move that, his <HI>Bugget</HI> be hung up in the <HI>State Hou&s;e,</HI> and con&s;ulted upon all difficult Emergencies.</P>
