<HI>Labour's</HI> as needful to procure <HI>Food</HI> for our Bodies.

As to <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> though we are at no pains to <HI>rai&s;e</HI> them, yet we are to <HI>catch</HI> them, with <HI>Hooks, Nets,</HI> &amp;c, and often to <HI>&s;pirt, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, dry</HI> them be|fore they are fit for our <HI>Food,</HI> or at lea&s;t fit to be <HI>kept</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> time without <HI>rotting</HI> and peri&s;hing.

<P><HI>Labour's</HI> al&s;o as needful to procure <HI>Cloaths;</HI> the great|e&s;t part whereof is commonly made of <HI>Sheeps Wool, Cot|ton Wool, Flax, Hemp, Silk</HI> (that's fir&s;t Spun fine by the <HI>Worms) Skins</HI> of Bea&s;ts for <HI>Shoes, Gloves,</HI> &amp;c. As to Sheep there's <HI>Labour</HI> to <HI>rai&s;e, tend, feed</HI> them Winter and Summer before their <HI>Wool</HI> is come to its full growth, and then, how much <HI>Labour</HI> in <HI>wa&s;hing, &s;hearing, card|ing, combing, &s;pinning, weaving</HI> (or <HI>knitting) fulling, making</HI> before we put it on our Bodies to <HI>wear?</HI> As to <HI>Flax</HI> there is Labour in <HI>&s;owing, pulling, dew-rotting,</HI> or <HI>water-rotting, breaking, hatchelling, &s;pining, weaving,</HI> &amp;c. before we u&s;e it for <HI>Cloathing.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e few and brief Hints plainly &s;how, that much <HI>Work</HI> or <HI>Labour</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our comforta|ble Living in the World. The Wi&s;e Creator and Gover|nour of all things has <HI>fitted</HI> and <HI>adapted</HI> Man for <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> be&s;ides the rational Endowments of his Immortal Soul, he has <HI>Feet</HI> for walking &amp; <HI>Hands</HI> for working; that when <HI>the Sun ari&s;eth, he may go forth to his work &amp; labour till the evening: he &s;hould work</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002010_0003_0FBA7CEDE6F76EF0">
<HI>while it is day.</HI> As God has <HI>fitted</HI> Man for <HI>Work,</HI> &s;o he has rendred his <HI>working</HI> ab&s;olutely needful for his own <HI>Support</HI> and <HI>Comfort;</HI> and has likewi&s;e &s;aid, <HI>Six Days &s;halt thou labour, and do all they work: Do your own bu&s;ine&s;s, work with your own hands that ye may have lack of nothing; if any will not work neither &s;hould he eat.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things being &s;o, I dont &s;ee how we can po&s;&s;i|bly excu&s;e our &s;elves, or have &s;olid peace in our own Brea&s;ts, if we indulge our &s;elves in <HI>Idlene&s;s.</HI> If &s;ome have &s;uch <HI>E&s;tates,</HI> that the <HI>Yearly Income's</HI> enough to maintain them, yet &s;ince they have the <HI>&s;ame Powers</HI> and Capacities for <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and are under the &s;ame <HI>Supream Law</HI> with others, they &s;eem inexcu&s;able if they <HI>wrap up their Talent in a Napkin,</HI> for they &s;hould be <HI>good Stewards</HI> of the Abilities betru&s;ted with them. The greater E&s;tates they have, the more they're indebted to Divine Providence, and &s;hould make grateful returns by vertuou&s;ly imploying betru&s;ted Abilities; yet as they have <HI>opportunity they may do good to all Men,</HI> and be|come more able <HI>to give to him that needeth.</HI> But <HI>Idle|ne&s;s</HI> &s;eems to be a double aggravated crime in tho&s;e, who&s;e hone&s;t Incomes can't maintain them. If they <HI>can Work</HI> and <HI>won't,</HI> they may well be counted <HI>Publick Nu|&s;ances,</HI> for in the <HI>Victuals</HI> they eat and <HI>Cloaths</HI> they wear, they really live on the <HI>Labour of others,</HI> yet make them no recompence for it: whether this may be &s;tyled <HI>open Inju&s;tice</HI> or <HI>&s;ecret Theft,</HI> I'll leave to the ingenious co decide. God's <HI>Authority</HI> and Mens own <HI>Nece&s;&s;ities,</HI> makes <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for them. Therefore Children &s;hould be Educated (not only in re|ligious Learning but al&s;o) to <HI>good Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> for they &s;hould <HI>be trained up in the way wherein they &s;hould go. Idlene&s;s</HI> &s;hould be indulged by none, but <HI>Diligence</HI> in proper Bu&s;ine&s;s, (which by God's Ble&s;&s;ing makes rich) &s;hould be ezemplifyed in all; the more there is of &s;uch <HI>Diligence</HI> among a People, &s;o much the more 'tis (or|dinarily) for their own Support and Comfort. So far as
<PB N="4" REF="002010_0004_0FBA7CEF322E6F80">
we are thus <HI>Indu&s;trious</HI> we are obedient to God, profitable to our &s;elves, u&s;eful to our Neighbours, advantagious to Po&s;terity, but <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> is the <HI>rever&s;e</HI> of all the&s;e. If <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> wont, I believe <HI>pre&s;&s;ing, pinching nece&s;&s;ity</HI> will make &s;ome more <HI>indu&s;trious</HI> than they u&s;ed to be. Yet to prevent mi&s;takes, I'll &s;ay, there is a great variety of Work needful for the good of Hu|mane Per&s;ons and Societies; be&s;ides <HI>Plowing, Hewing</HI> or an <HI>immediate laborious working with the bands.</HI> The &s;tudying of <HI>Languages, Arts, Sciences, Divinity, Phy&s;ick,</HI> &amp;c. and the employing the skill or knowledge obtained by &s;uch Study, may greatly promote the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ons own benefit,</HI> and the good of tho&s;e he is con|cerned with. This is true as to <HI>Mini&s;ters, School-Ma&s;ters, Phy&s;icians,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Hints about LABOUR, we pa&s;s to con&s;i|der &s;omething about COMMERCE, by which I here under&s;tand all manner of <HI>Exchange</HI> in dealing; whether we Exchange <HI>Money</HI> for <HI>Goods, Victuals, Labour,</HI> or Exchange one &s;ort of Goods for another, or Labour either for Labour or Wages. All &s;uch Exchange I here com|prehend under the name of <HI>Commerce,</HI> and &s;uch Com|merce is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the good of Humane Societies. Tho' an <HI>Hou&s;e, Food, Raiment,</HI> are needful for my comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence, yet I can't be &s;uppo&s;ed to be equally skilled in making, rai&s;ing, and providing the&s;e various and different nece&s;&s;aries. A Great variety of <HI>Arts, Skill, Labour,</HI> and a great number of Per&s;ons is ss needful ordinarily, to furni&s;h &s;o much as one Per&s;on with what is proper, for his <HI>Habitation, Food</HI> and <HI>Rai|ment.</HI> Such is the &s;canty narrowne&s;s of our Capacities, that generally much U&s;e, Habit, Cu&s;tom is needful to render a Per&s;on truly skilful or accurate at any one &s;ort of Bu&s;ine&s;s. Common &s;ayings declare, that <HI>U&s;e makes perfect. Experience is the be&s;t School-Ma&s;ter.</HI> Studious Diligence in a <HI>Particular Calling,</HI> generally makes a Per&s;on skilful at it; the more Skilful, &s;o much the fa&s;ter
<PB N="5" REF="002010_0005_0FBA7CF1E7B8F200">
and better he can Work. The better he Works, &s;o much the more profitable to him that buys and pays; and the fa&s;ter he Works or the more he does, &s;o much the more profitable 'tis for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Every Per&s;on therefore &s;hould endeavour to be Skilful and Accurate at &s;ome &s;uitable and proper Work or Bu&s;ine&s;s. that thereby he may be able to manage an hone&s;t <HI>Commerce</HI> with his Neighbours, and may make a ju&s;t recompence for the various benefits he receives from them. For in&s;tance, if a <HI>Shoe-maker</HI> with the <HI>Shoes</HI> he makes, hone&s;tly pay one for the <HI>Leather,</HI> another for the <HI>Thread</HI> he works up, another for the <HI>Food</HI> his Family eats, another for the <HI>Cloaths</HI> they wear, &amp;c. herein he manages an hone&s;t <HI>Commerce</HI> &amp; <HI>Exchange</HI> with tho&s;e he is &s;upplyed or benefited by. Or if he Sells his <HI>Shoes</HI> for an hone&s;t price in <HI>Money,</HI> &amp; with that Money pays particular Per&s;ons he deals with, and al&s;o Publick dues to <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> &amp;c. herein &s;till he manages an <HI>hone&s;t Commerce.</HI> And I think &s;ome <HI>Commerce</HI> of this general Nature, mu&s;t be managed by every one that would live hone&s;tly. When do we eat one <HI>mouthful of Bread,</HI> or put on any <HI>Rai|ment</HI> whether <HI>Woolen</HI> or <HI>Linen,</HI> but that &s;everal Scores of different Per&s;ons have been imployed more remotely or immediately, to rai&s;e and prepare the &s;ame for our u&s;e? And when the Labour of &s;o <HI>many</HI> is imployed for <HI>my</HI> benefit, if <HI>my</HI> Labour (or the produce of it) be not immediately or remotely an equivalent benefit to them, I am then unju&s;t and di&s;hone&s;t to them; for why &s;hould I be benefitted by their <HI>Labour,</HI> without making a ju&s;t return in being &s;ome way or other as &s;erviceable to them as they are to me? If we (being able) do'nt do at lea&s;t as much good to Mankind, as we receive from them: then we are Debtors to our Neighbours, and unju&s;t in our Conduct to them.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as we &s;hould de&s;ire to benefit others, as well as be benefitted by them; therefore we &s;hould not Sell our Labour or the produce of it, for more than 'tis
<PB N="6" REF="002010_0006_0FBA7CF4D6FF19A8">
worth, according to the Rules of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Equity:</HI> nor &s;hould we de&s;ire to have our Neighbours Labour, or the produce of it, for <HI>le&s;s</HI> than the <HI>ju&s;t Value</HI> of it. Therefore to Sell as high or dear, and Buy as cheap or low, as po&s;&s;ibly we can, is no good Rule for Chri&s;tians to go by: <HI>for we &s;hould love our Neighbours as our &s;elves, &amp; do as we would be done by.</HI></P>
<P>Among the many <HI>Products</HI> of <HI>Humane Labours</HI> &s;ome are looked on as <HI>nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> others as being chiefly for convenience, ornament or delight. It's as plain that we &s;hould prefer <HI>Nece&s;&s;aries</HI> to what is only for Ornament, or to plea&s;e the fancy. <HI>Raiment</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary for us, tho' this or that particular <HI>Mode, Cut, Fa&s;hion</HI> or <HI>Trimming</HI> is not &s;o. Its criminal therefore if thro' <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> we neglect to provide nece&s;&s;aries for our &s;elves, or Families; its criminal al&s;o, if we employ &s;o much of our <HI>Labour</HI> or the <HI>Produce</HI> of it, in getting Things for Ornament or Delight, as to pinch or &s;traighten our &s;elves as to <HI>Ne|ce&s;&s;aries;</HI> or render us unable to pay our ju&s;t Debts. On the other hand, it's more noble to be employed in &s;erv|ing and &s;upplying the nece&s;&s;ities of others, than meer|ly in plea&s;ing the fancy of any. The <HI>Plow-Man</HI> that rai&s;eth Grain, is more &s;erviceable to Mankind, than the <HI>Painter</HI> who draws only to plea&s;e the Eye. The <HI>hungry</HI> Man would count fine Pictures but a mean Entertain|ment. The <HI>King him&s;elf is &s;erved by the Field.</HI> The <HI>Carpenter</HI> who builds a good <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> to defend us from Wind and Weather, is more &s;erviceable than the curious <HI>Carver,</HI> who employs his Art to plea&s;e the Fancy. This condemns not Painting or Carving, but only &s;hows, that what's more &s;ub&s;tantially &s;erviceable to Mankind, is much preferrable to what is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. Doubtle&s;s <HI>Nebuchadnezzers</HI> Politick's led him to think &s;o, when to <HI>weaken the Jews,</HI> he carried from them not only the <HI>Princes</HI> &amp; <HI>Mighty Men of Valour,</HI> but al&s;o the <HI>Carpen|ters</HI> and <HI>Smiths</HI> who&s;e Occupation was very nece&s;&s;ary &amp; u&s;eful to humane Society.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002010_0007_0FBA7CF7245719C0">
Indeed when a People <HI>grow numerous,</HI> and part are &s;ufficient to rai&s;e nece&s;&s;aries for the whole, then tis al|lowable and laudable, that &s;ome &s;hould be imployed in <HI>Innocent Arts</HI> more for <HI>Ornament</HI> than <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity:</HI> any innocent bu&s;ine&s;s that gets an hone&s;t penny, is better than <HI>Idlene&s;s.</HI> If &s;ome do <HI>nice, curious</HI> works in <HI>Gold, Sil|ver, Bra&s;s, Iron, Linnen, Silk</HI> &amp;c. and others who&s;e E&s;tates will bear it pay them for their <HI>Labour</HI> and buy what they make, this is much better for the <HI>Publick,</HI> than that any &s;hould be idle: This yields the greate&s;t &s;atis|faction to me, as to many unnece&s;&s;ary Niceties and Curi|o&s;ities in <HI>building, adorning furni&s;hing</HI> of <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> in making fine <HI>co&s;tly Gardens, Cloaths</HI> &amp;c. that hereby the <HI>Poor</HI> are <HI>imployed</HI> and <HI>maintained,</HI> when they could &s;carce <HI>find work and get a living;</HI> if no bu&s;ine&s;s was done among&s;t mankind, but what is in its own nature ne|ce&s;&s;ary to provide <HI>Habitations, Food</HI> and <HI>Raiment:</HI> If the Rich thus pay for &s;uch needle&s;s Curio&s;ities, chiefly to <HI>imploy and maintain</HI> the <HI>Poor,</HI> its noble and generous in them, better than if they had given them the Co&s;t thereof for nothing: but if chiefly to gratifie their own <HI>pride,</HI> its <HI>criminal in them.</HI> Yet ob&s;erve, if we are rich and able; its better to imploy and maintain the <HI>Poor</HI> among <HI>our-&s;elves,</HI> than tho&s;e in <HI>forreign parts.</HI></P>
<P>And we had better give &s;omething to tho&s;e that cant work, and to educate <HI>poor Children</HI> &amp;c, than to be lavi&s;h in buying of needle&s;s curio&s;ityes for our-&s;elves.</P>
<P>But truly our Country is not yet of that <HI>Age,</HI> Peo|ple not &s;o numerous, nor we in &s;uch plentiful circum|&s;tances, as to require that many (if any) &s;hould be im|ployed in niceties and curio&s;ities. Tho' God has given us a good Land, a very good Countrey for tho&s;e that will be indu&s;trious, yet it is a <HI>Northern Climate,</HI> the winter &s;o long and cold, as to make much diligent Labour ne|ce&s;&s;ary to provide <HI>Dwelling, Food</HI> and <HI>Raiment,</HI> tho' curio&s;ities are neglected. We &s;hould therefore Exerci&s;e our-&s;elves, and incourage one another in imployments

directly tending to &s;upply our nece&s;&s;ities, and promote our comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In <HI>Commerce</HI> to be managed by a <HI>private Family,</HI> do's not prudence direct us, that we &s;hould &s;ell or part with what we can be&s;t &s;pare, and receive by way of exchange for it, what is mo&s;t needful for us? If we receive mo|ney that an&s;wers all things procurable by commerce; if we can't get that, we &s;hould fir&s;tly aim at whats mo&s;t <HI>&s;erviceable</HI> rather than at <HI>curio&s;ities.</HI> And I pre|&s;ume the &s;ame rules hold good, as to <HI>Commerce</HI> between one Countrey and another. I &s;uppo&s;e this Province doth not rai&s;e nigh &s;o much <HI>Provi&s;ions</HI> as is needful to feed our-&s;elves, and &s;upply our <HI>Shipping,</HI> we buy much from other places, while &s;o, would it not be an hurt to &s;end any <HI>Provi&s;ions</HI> to a <HI>Forreign Market?</HI> But out of the produce of our Labour, we may &s;pare great quan|tities of <HI>Fi&s;h, Oyl, Whalebone,</HI> &amp;c. and for the&s;e, what returns &s;hould we chiefly de&s;ire? Why things that are mo&s;t &s;erviceable and nece&s;&s;ary for us, and not for needle&s;s Commodities, &s;undry of which were glanced at in the Letter <HI>March 6th.</HI></P>
<P>And I think lea&s;t of all &s;hould we de&s;ire &s;o much <HI>Rum</HI> as is &s;pent here. The&s;e <HI>Northern Plantations</HI> on the Continent, are great &s;ufferers by the va&s;t quantities of <HI>Rum</HI> &s;pent among them. Tho' in &s;ome ca&s;es it may be u&s;eful <HI>medicinally,</HI> yet I have no rea&s;on to think that 'tis proper for any, to make an u&s;ual <HI>drink</HI> of it if the <HI>Exci&s;e</HI> were &s;o rai&s;ed, that it could not be retailed under Ten Shillings a Quart, I believe it would be ten times better for this <HI>Province</HI> than it is. If the high price might re&s;train many of the poor labourers, from getting <HI>Rum</HI> and <HI>Flip;</HI> I believe their needy Families would be much better provided for than they are. Don't &s;ome &s;ay, that when Men drink &s;o much, they drink the blood of their Wives and Children; that is, they wa&s;te the co&s;t which &s;hould provide nece&s;&s;aries for their Families.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Labourers</HI> in my Family &s;pend one fortnight

(I'll &s;uppo&s;e) in a year, to get <HI>Hoops</HI> or <HI>Staves</HI> for a We&s;t India Market; and we &s;pend the returns of it in <HI>Rum,</HI> this would be but a mi&s;erable <HI>Commerce</HI> for my Family. We could have done well enough without the <HI>Rum,</HI> and if that Fortnights Labour had been &s;pent in rai&s;ing <HI>Grain,</HI> there would have been a better &s;upply of Nece&s;&s;aries; if in rai&s;ing <HI>Flax</HI> or <HI>Hemp,</HI> we might be employ'd in the Winter in dre&s;&s;ing it; in&s;tead of &s;pending our Time and burning our Skins over our <HI>Drams.</HI></P>
<P>I'm humbly of the Opinion, that multiplying of <HI>Taverns, Licences</HI> to Retail Drink, and the Drinking &s;o much <HI>Rum,</HI> have been un&s;peakably hurtful to this Province, and if not &s;peedily retrenched will evidently hurt and impoveri&s;h us much more. If the needle&s;s co&s;t in <HI>Rum</HI> in a few Years pa&s;t were computed, would it not amount to as much as the Inhabitants of the Province have taken up upon their Lands? If that co&s;t in <HI>Rum</HI> had been &s;pared, might not this Mortgaging their Lands have been in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevented? If any ingenious Per&s;on could pretty fully inform the Publick, how much <HI>Rum</HI> is Retailed and Spent in this Province in One Year; it might po&s;&s;ibly give to &s;ome a new view of things, and make them more careful to prevent or &s;uppre&s;s what threatens us.</P>
<P>The Order that I propo&s;ed, requires that I &s;hould nextly &s;ay &s;omething about MONEY. And by this I principally mean &amp; intend, <HI>Gold</HI> or <HI>Silver</HI> that has &s;ome <HI>Mark</HI> or <HI>Stamp</HI> on it by <HI>Publick Authority,</HI> &s;hewing it to be Legal and Current Coin, whether it pa&s;&s;eth by Tale or Weight. Tho' I conceive what pa&s;&s;es by <HI>Tale</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;uch a <HI>Weight</HI> as the Law pre&s;cribes for it, as <HI>Crowns, Shillings,</HI> &amp;c. As for &s;uch <HI>Silver &amp; Gold Money,</HI> I think it is Univer&s;ally e&s;teemed by all Civilized Nations, has been &s;o in all Ages; and is reckoned the be&s;t <HI>Medium of Trade</HI> or <HI>Exchange,</HI> by all that are much u&s;ed in Buying and Selling.</P>
<P><HI>Money's</HI> more durable than Eatables, Drinkables and other Commodities which Per&s;on often Exchange with

one another. In <HI>Silver</HI> &amp; <HI>Gold</HI> a great Price or Value may be contained in a &s;mall Compa&s;s, a &s;mall Quantity: a &s;mall handful of <HI>Money</HI> may buy Cart-Loads of &s;ome other things that are yet very u&s;eful for us. <HI>Money</HI> al&s;o is ea&s;y of <HI>Tran&s;portation,</HI> a great Value may be ea&s;ily Tran&s;ported by Land or Water. The&s;e con&s;iderations render <HI>Money</HI> very Commodious and U&s;eful in <HI>Trade</HI> or <HI>Commerce. Gold</HI> &amp; <HI>Silver</HI> are reckon'd to have an <HI>in|trin&s;ick Value</HI> in them, and &s;ometimes they are u&s;ed to make <HI>Rings, Jewels, Spoons, Cups,</HI> &amp;c. but <HI>Money's</HI> chiefly u&s;eful to Men, as its the mo&s;t convenient Medium of Exchange or Commerce. The Wi&s;e Man &s;ays, <HI>Money an&s;wers all things.</HI> If a Man has <HI>Money</HI> enough, he may buy <HI>Food</HI> and <HI>Raiment,</HI> any thing for <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> or <HI>Delight,</HI> that's attainable by Commerce. Generally, Men had rather have <HI>ready Money</HI> than any thing el&s;e, for what they Sell; and <HI>Money</HI> will more readily Buy what's wanted, than any thing el&s;e will. This proceeds from the Univer&s;al Value and E&s;teem, which Men have for <HI>Money.</HI> It's true, <HI>The love of Money is the root of all Evil; Coveteou&s;ne&s;s is Idolatry;</HI> if we take &s;uch <HI>Cor|ruptable Things as Silver and Gold for our chief trea|&s;ure;</HI> if we make <HI>Gold our hope, &amp; fine Gold our Confidence;</HI> I &s;ay, to do this, mu&s;t needs be criminal, provoking to God and hurtful to our &s;elves; yet the U|niver&s;al E&s;teem Men have for <HI>Money</HI> (if it be not ex|ce&s;&s;ive) &s;eems to be a favour and benefit of God to Man|kind; becau&s;e thereby it becomes an Univer&s;al Medium of Exchange or Commerce. If a Man has Forty diffe|rent things to buy, and <HI>Money</HI> enough; 'twill buy them all as readily or more readily, than if he had Forty &s;orts of Commodities to part with for them. There's an E&s;teem of <HI>Money</HI> which is lawful not vicious; when its valued as the be&s;t Medium of Trade or Exchange. Such an E&s;teem of it <HI>Abraham</HI> had, when he offered <HI>Money</HI> to buy a Burying Place; and <HI>Jacob,</HI> when he &s;ent <HI>Money</HI> to <HI>Egypt</HI> to buy Corn in a time of Famine; and <HI>David</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="002010_0011_0FBA7D00852EB8A0">
when he offered <HI>Money</HI> for a Spot of Ground to build an Altar on. <HI>Money</HI> being the be&s;t, mo&s;t approved Univer&s;al Medium of Exchange; the more plenty there is of it among a People, the more ea&s;ily they may ma|nage all their Affairs of <HI>Trade</HI> or <HI>Commerce.</HI> If a Man can have <HI>ready Money</HI> for what he doth, or Sells, and his <HI>Money</HI> will Buy what he has occa&s;ion for, this renders the management of his Affairs very ea&s;y, to what other|wi&s;e 'twould be. A Bartering <HI>Trade</HI> is very trouble&s;ome, tho' &s;ometimes needful for want of <HI>Money.</HI> It was one of the great Outward Ble&s;&s;ings of King <HI>Solomons</HI> Reign, that <HI>Money</HI> was very plenty among his People.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much therefore as the <HI>Export</HI> of this Conntry, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exceed what we &s;pend of Imported Com|modities, in order to the making <HI>Money</HI> pa&s;s Current among us; it mu&s;t needs be wi&s;e in us, to Spend as little as need requires of Imported Goods, and to Rai&s;e, Make, Produce, as much as we can for our own Supply. The great Wi&s;dom of our <HI>Briti&s;h Nation</HI> appears in incou|raging their own <HI>Produce,</HI> their own <HI>Manufacture;</HI> in incouraging <HI>Labour, Indu&s;try, Diligence,</HI> U&s;eful <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Trades</HI> among them&s;elves, that &s;o their <HI>own People</HI> may live by their <HI>own Labour.</HI> And &s;hould not we who proceed from them imitate this their laudible <HI>Wi&s;|dom and Indu&s;try?</HI> Methinks the more we do &s;o, the more we de&s;erve their Prai&s;e and Commendation. If it is Wi&s;e and advantageous in them to do thus, mu&s;t they not commend it as Wi&s;e and Advantageous in us, to imitate them herein?</P>

Would it not grieve them to &s;ee us Proud, Lazy, Extra|vagant, Spendthrifts, bringing our &s;elves (for want of Wi&s;e Indu&s;trious Methods) into perplexing Difficulties? Yet how faulty are we herein? We have been &s;o defi|cient in <HI>Farming,</HI> and managing our own <HI>Manufacture,</HI> lived &s;o much above our <HI>Abilities,</HI> &s;pent &s;o much of <HI>Imported</HI> Commodities; that our <HI>Money's</HI> gone, there's &s;carce a Penny of it pa&s;&s;ing for a Twelvemonth.

<P>Now Con&s;ider, NOTES OR BILLS OF CREDIT. Indeed I have not &s;o great a clearne&s;s in my own mind about the&s;e things, as po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome others have: Yet I'll humbly offer, that I take the Nature of &s;uch <HI>Bills</HI> to be to help our <HI>Memories,</HI> &s;hewing how much is Due to us; and the &s;ecuring our Intere&s;t, by Intitling us to &s;o much as the Bill &s;pecifies, from tho&s;e obliged by it to pay us. A <HI>Note</HI> or <HI>Bill of Credit</HI> is not <HI>Money,</HI> nor &s;uppo&s;ed (in it &s;elf con&s;idered) to be <HI>Payment,</HI> but rather a Security that Payment &s;hall be made in &s;uch a time. A. obliges him&s;elf by a Note under his Hand, to pay <HI>Five Pounds</HI> to B. in Two Months time; this Note is neither Money nor Payment, but carries the Nature of a Bond or Obli|gation, to make Payment at the Time mentioned. The pre&s;ent want of <HI>Money,</HI> &s;eems to be the very rea&s;on &amp; Foundation of this Note; for if he who Binds him&s;elf by it, had <HI>Five Pounds Money</HI> to lay down, what need he Bind him&s;elf to pay it Two Months hence? Every one had rather have pre&s;ent pay, than be a&s;&s;ured by a Note he &s;hall be paid hereafter. If every one could make pre&s;ent Pay, for Work done or Goods Bought; he would have no occa&s;ion to de&s;ire <HI>Creditor's</HI> Patience, or
<PB N="13" REF="002010_0013_0FBA7D02F98F32F0">
to give a Note to Pay him after &s;uch a Time. So that generally &s;peaking, <HI>Pre&s;ent want of Money,</HI> is the Rea&s;on or Foundation of Notes or Bills of Credit.</P>
<P>Of &s;uch Bills, &s;ome are of a more Private, &s;ome of a more Publick nature. I conceive their private ones con|cern (ordinarily) only tho&s;e particular Per&s;ons who&s;e names are mentioned therein. If <HI>A.</HI> obliges him&s;elf by a Note to pay Five pounds to <HI>B.</HI> in three months from the Date thereof; this Note is of no benefit but to <HI>B.</HI> nor can it effect any good for him, till the three months are ended. If a Note mentions the term of time, when payment is to be made; at the Expiration of that term, the Obligation &s;hould be fulfilled, and payment be defer|red no longer. If no particular term be mentioned, but <HI>A,</HI> is obliged to pay Five Pounds to <HI>B.</HI> upon Demand, it's then &s;uppo&s;ed, that very quickly, or whenever <HI>B,</HI> plea&s;es, he may demand and receive his Five Pounds.</P>
<P>Some &s;uch thing as this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be under&s;tood, where there's no particular term &s;et for payment; el&s;e the Note would only be a Declaration, that <HI>A.</HI> would always owe for Five Pounds to <HI>B.</HI> and a thou&s;and of &s;uch Notes or Declarations are not worth a <HI>Straw:</HI> I would thank no man for his <HI>Note</HI> or <HI>Bond,</HI> obliging him&s;elf always to owe me a Thou&s;and Pounds, for if he always owes it, he never pays it, and &s;o I &s;hall never be the better for it.</P>
<P>This may &s;hew too, how weak and groundle&s;s a fancy 'tis, that <HI>Paper Money</HI> (as it's called) or <HI>Province Bills,</HI> or <HI>Bank Bills,</HI> if &s;uch there were, might be confirmed and e&s;tabli&s;h'd &s;o, as to be of perpetual cur|rency and u&s;e like <HI>Silver Money.</HI> Tho&s;e who entertain this Notion, may for all me, plea&s;e them&s;elves with <HI>Notes</HI> and <HI>Bonds,</HI> whereby Per&s;ons ingage always to owe (con&s;equentially never to pay) them &s;o much&mdash;A|gain, <HI>A.</HI> may give a <HI>Note</HI> to <HI>B.</HI> to receive Five Pounds of <HI>C.</HI> or in other words, may draw a Note upon <HI>C.</HI> to pay unto <HI>B.</HI> Five Pounds upon &s;ight of &s;aid Note, or
<PB N="14" REF="002010_0014_0FBA7D06D1E56BC0">
in &s;o many Days after. If C. doth prote&s;t or refu&s;e this Note, then 'tis of no pre&s;ent immediate u&s;e to any one. If C. accepts the Note, he's then oblig'd to act as that directs. In this ca&s;e the Note is of no immediate u&s;e or benefit to any but to B. again.</P>
<P>If A. gives a <HI>Note</HI> in General terms to this purpo&s;e, <Q><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> I acknowledge my &s;elf Debtor Five Pounds to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Note, and oblige my &s;elf to pay &s;aid Sum at the end of Three Months, from the Date here|of. Dated this &amp;c.&mdash;A.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Such a <HI>Note,</HI> per&s;ons may receive or refu&s;e at plea&s;ure, none can be obliged to accept it, but the more the Abili|ty and Hone&s;ty of A. (who Sub&s;cribes the Note) is known, &s;o much the more likely 'tis, that the Note will pa&s;s with &s;ome per&s;ons, if they're &s;atisfied 'tis not Counterfeit.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Bills</HI> or <HI>Notes</HI> already mentioned, are of a private Nature; their whole Credit or Value depends on the Ability, and Obligation of &s;ome particular per&s;on con&s;idered as in a private capacity.</P>
<P>But then other <HI>Notes</HI> or <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> are of a Pub|lick Nature; there is, the Anthority or Government in a Kingdom or Country, ingages to make them good, to Pay or Di&s;count them. I take our <HI>Province</HI> Bills (and tho&s;e of Neighbouring Governments, <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire, Connecticut,</HI> &amp;c. to be of this Nature. And tho' the&s;e Bills are in common Di&s;cour&s;e called <HI>Paper Mo|ney,</HI> yet the Law does not look on them as <HI>Money,</HI> but calls them <HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Publick Credit.</HI> He therefore that receives one of the&s;e Bills, doth not receive Money, nor pay properly &s;o called. He that pays down what he ows, hath not occa&s;ion to be credited or tru&s;ted; but ina&s;much as the <HI>Province</HI> had not ready Money to &s;erve the Publick occa&s;ions, therefore they emitted the&s;e Notes or Bills of Credit, as Security to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Bill for the Sum &s;pecified in it. For In&s;tance, the Twenty Shillings Bill. <Q>This Indented Bill of Twenty
<PB N="15" REF="002010_0015_0FBA7D08F8ACE940">
Shillings due from the Province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay in <HI>New-England,</HI> to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or thereof, &s;hall be in value equal to Money; and &s;hall be accordingly ac|cepted by the Trea&s;urer, and Receivers &s;ubordinate to him in all Publick payments, and for any Stock at any time in the Trea&s;ury &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>He that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the Bill, do's not po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>Twenty Shillings,</HI> for that Sum is due (therefore not paid) to him; nor do's he po&s;&s;e&s;s Money, for the Bill is to be in value equal to Money, therefore the Bill is nothing but a Note or In&s;trument whereby the Province is obliged to Pay or Di&s;count Twenty Shillings to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. I u&s;e the word pay or di&s;count, becau&s;e tho' the Bill &s;ays, Twenty Shillings are due, from the <HI>Province</HI> to the <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or,</HI> yet it do's not directly &s;ay, that the Province &s;hall pay Twenty Shillings to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; but only that this Bill &s;hall be accepted as equal to Money by the Trea&s;urer, &amp;c. or if there be any Stock in the Trea&s;ury the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or may bring his Bill, and have Twenty Shill|ings worth (as I take the meaning to be) of &s;aid Stock.</P>
<P>But I don't &s;ee it likely, that there &s;hould be any Stock in the Trea&s;ury be&s;ides Bills; while the Bills are to be received there at <HI>five per Cent advance;</HI> for while &s;o, who would pay his <HI>Tax</HI> in any thing be&s;ides Bills? The Province owes the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or Twenty Shillings, when the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is taxed one and Twenty Shillings to the Province, and brings this Bill, the Trea&s;urer receives it, and &s;o the Twenty Shillings due to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is dis|counted, yea, his Twenty Shillings pa&s;s for Twenty one Shillings, by the five per Cent. advance. So that I hum|bly conceive, the principal way of Sinking the Bills, will be by calling them in, and di&s;counting with (rather than paying) the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The Fund or Security for Province Bills, is the Duties of Impo&s;t and Exci&s;e, and al&s;o the Tax to be levied on Polls, and E&s;tates both Real and Per&s;onal; as appears by the Acts for emitting Bills. <HI>Anno. Dom.</HI> 1702. &amp; 1703.
<PB N="16" REF="002010_0016_0FBA7D10F65F3468">
Therefore the more of the&s;e Bills are received into the Trea&s;ury, by <HI>Impo&s;t, Exci&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Rates,</HI> &s;o much the le&s;s the Province is in Debt; for this drawing Bills, di&s;|counts with the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them.</P>
<P>And the &s;horter the time is for drawing in of Bills the greater will be their value and e&s;teem in the minds of Per&s;ons. Every one de&s;ires pre&s;ent pay; if this can't be had, yet the &s;ooner the Debt is paid or di&s;counted, &s;o much the better to the Creditor. Any one had rather have a Note from his Debtor; to pay him in Three Months, than in three Years. Therefore to defer the paying or di&s;counting a Bill of Credit is a certain and ef|fectual way to depreciate or le&s;&s;en the value of it. In Private Dealings, if a Per&s;on finds that he whom he Trades with, doth not keep his word, nor pay at the time he oblig'd him&s;elf by his Note; he'll be the more backward to deal with or tru&s;t him for the future: This is too true and plain to need proof. The nature of the thing is the &s;ame, as to Publick Bills. It's the promi&s;e or ingagement of the Government, that gives the whole value and currency to the Bill, and makes &s;o much due from the Province to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it. If therefore the Ingagement be not complied with at the time &s;et, but payment (or calling in or di&s;counting the Bill) be po&s;tponed; does not this le&s;&s;en the value of the Bill? and &s;ome wi&s;e and good Per&s;ons even doubt about the fair|ne&s;s of this po&s;tponing, however it &s;eems plain, that it do's not commend Publick Ingagements, to the belief or tru&s;t of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Do's it not give them an handle to argue; that if the fulfilling of one Publick promi&s;e be po&s;tponed, &s;o it may be with another, and what will publick Faith (or ingage|ment) &s;ignifie after this rate? Whereas it is the Wi&s;|dom, Honour and Safety of any Government to have their Credit &s;trengthen'd, and all their Ingagements readily relied on.</P>
<P>If &s;ome will &s;ay this <HI>Po&s;tponing</HI> is no hurt, for the
<PB N="17" REF="002010_0017_0FBA7D13A83409B8">
promi&s;e is made to our&s;elves, and we may defer the ac|compli&s;hment at plea&s;ure. Reply. But is not the matter otherwi&s;e? The Ingagement in the Bill is made by the Province or Government, not to it, but to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Bill. And generally &s;peaking, none but he to whom the Promi&s;e is made; can fairly <HI>relea&s;e</HI> or <HI>defer</HI> the Accompli&s;hment of it. If a Per&s;on engageth to pay me 20 <HI>s.</HI> at Two Months end, when that term is Expir|ed, he can't fairly <HI>defer</HI> Payment, without my leave or Allowance.</P>
<P>However, if <HI>Po&s;tponing the drawing in of Bills,</HI> does &s;ink the Credit or E&s;teem of them, and &s;o rai&s;e the Price of Commodities Imported and Produced here; this hurts many. The <HI>Merchant</HI> and <HI>Husbandman</HI> &s;eems lea&s;t hurt, becau&s;e they can rai&s;e on the Commodities they Sell to each other, and &s;o keep a &s;ort of Ballance. But tho&s;e &s;uffer greatly, who live on <HI>Salaries</HI> and on the <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> or Incomes of their E&s;tates; and &s;o do <HI>Tradesmen</HI> and <HI>Day-Labourers.</HI> If I'm a <HI>Labourer</HI> and can have <HI>Four Shillings</HI> for a Days Work, and a few Years ago I could buy <HI>Wheat</HI> for <HI>Five Shillings</HI> a Bu&s;hel, but now mu&s;t give <HI>Ten;</HI> this &s;hows, that the Produce of my Labour is not above half the Benefit to me that it was. This is a very great pre&s;&s;ure and burden on poor Labourers, and I can't but think it's much owing, to the mean opinion Per|&s;ons have of <HI>Bills of Credit.</HI></P>
<P>I think I have heard, as tho' in <HI>South-Carolina, Silver Money</HI> has been at above 30 <HI>s.</HI> an Ounce, and that a <HI>pair of Shoes</HI> have co&s;t above <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> there in Bills, when po&s;&s;ibly 8 or 9 Shillings in <HI>Silver</HI> would have pur|cha&s;ed them. We &s;hould take heed in this <HI>Province,</HI> that we don't &s;tear the &s;ame Cour&s;e with them. Therefore it &s;eems much for the advantage of this People (in my appre|hen&s;ion) to have the <HI>Bills of Publick Credit</HI> called into the Trea&s;ury, as &s;oon as the E&s;tabli&s;hment they are on will admit of. To increa&s;e &s;uch Bills, or continue them out longer than the foot they're on requires, appears to me to be a me|thod
<PB N="18" REF="002010_0018_0FBA7D151FB2F998">
for continuing and increa&s;ing our mi&s;ery. To de&s;ire the Emitting more Bills, or Po&s;tponing the Collecting of out&s;tanding ones, is plainly de&s;iring to be in Debt, when as every wi&s;e and hone&s;t Man &s;hould de&s;ire to be out of Debt, <HI>&amp; to owe no Man any thing but love. Parents &s;hould lay up for their Children,</HI> but if the pre&s;ent Gene|ration do not draw in the Publick Bills as &s;oon as fairly may be, they may Intail Debts on their Po&s;terity; who mu&s;t (Buy as it were, &amp;) Pay for the <HI>Inheritances</HI> their Fathers left them, if they would be the full and proper Owners of them. And is it not unkind in <HI>Parents,</HI> thus to antecipate, and while Living to &s;pend on that which after they are Dead, their Children mu&s;t Labour and Pay for?</P>
<P>But here's a Difficulty to be con&s;idered, <HI>Paper Money</HI> (as 'tis called) is &s;o &s;carce already, that it's &s;omething trouble&s;ome to deal between Man and Man for want of more; and the more is called in, the greater will the Difficulty be.</P>
<P>Reply. Tho' its difficult now and probably will be more &s;o for a while, yet it may be con&s;idered, that the pre&s;&s;ing Difficulty &s;hould make us do all we can to get rid of it; which (I &s;uppo&s;e) can't be done, till the <HI>Bills</HI> are called in and Burnt. This can't be done at once but gradually. And the le&s;&s;ening their Quantity will certain|ly increa&s;e their Value, &s;o that gradually they'l be e&s;teem|ed as good as <HI>Silver Money,</HI> tho' now there's a va&s;t Difference. And I think the Price of Commodities Im|ported and Produced here, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily <HI>fall,</HI> as the Value and E&s;teem of <HI>Bills</HI> do <HI>ri&s;e.</HI> This &s;eems a likely way too, to make <HI>Money</HI> gradually pa&s;s again among us; For if the Value of <HI>Bills</HI> does ri&s;e to be Equal with <HI>Money</HI> in Private Commerce, and Five Shillings in <HI>Mo|ney</HI> will Buy no more than a Five Shilling <HI>Bill,</HI> then the <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or</HI> will almo&s;t as readily part with one as t'other. But now, tho' Quantities of <HI>Silver</HI> (as I've heard) are Yearly brought into the Country, yet the difference between
<PB N="19" REF="002010_0019_0FBA7D169AB97610">
that and Bills being &s;o great as 'tis, the <HI>Silver</HI> does not pa&s;s between Man and Man in common dealing, but is bought up by the <HI>Merchants</HI> to make Returns to Great Britain.</P>
<P>If you ask, Whether An Act to cau&s;e <HI>Impo&s;t</HI> &amp; <HI>Exci&s;e</HI> to be paid in <HI>Silver,</HI> would not oblige Merchants to bring it into the Country, and &s;o gradually make it pa&s;s among us?</P>
<P>I'll mode&s;tly reply, it belongs not to me to decide this Ca&s;e; yet Two Difficulties &s;eem to attend it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Would not this le&s;&s;on the Value of <HI>Bills,</HI> if the <HI>Publick</HI> &s;hould prefer <HI>Silver</HI> to them in &s;uch a way?</P>
<P>Secondly, Is not this directly contrary to the Tenor of the <HI>Bills</HI> them&s;elves? That &s;ays, the <HI>Bill &s;hall be in Value equal to Money, and &s;hall be accordingly accepted by the Trea&s;urer, &amp;c. and in all Publick Payments.</HI> If to give Currency to the Bill, the Government have made it Equal to <HI>Money</HI> in all <HI>Publick Payments;</HI> nay 5 per Cent. better in &s;uch Payments; then how can it be re|fu&s;ed in <HI>any</HI> Publick Payment, and <HI>Silver</HI> be preferred to it, without directly contradicting the Publick Engage|ments, which alone has given it all the Value it has? If therefore we would make no <HI>infraction</HI> on the <HI>Bills,</HI> or the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> they are on; I &s;ee no way to <HI>rai&s;e</HI> their Value and E&s;teem among People, but by le&s;&s;ening their Quantity and calling them in as &s;oon as fairly may be. And tho' the doing this may increa&s;e our Difficulties in &s;ome regards, yet it may decrea&s;e them in others. I think our over Trading, Living above our Abilities, needle&s;ly &s;pending <HI>Imported</HI> Commodities, and doing too little to &s;upply our &s;elves, have evidently, tho' gradually brought the&s;e Difficulties, we &s;hould therefore be patient (not fretful and quarrel&s;ome) under them, and be thankful to Divine Providence, if we may gradually (tho' with many an hard rub) get rid of them, and not Intail them as a mi&s;chief and mi&s;ery on Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Money</HI> is now as <HI>Plenty</HI> as ever in the World
<PB N="20" REF="002010_0020_0FBA7D18EA190DC8">
in General, and daily increa&s;es rather than decrea|&s;es; its now as much e&s;teemed as ever, as a Medium of Trade. And if we were Prudent and Indu&s;trious and Frugal, I don't &s;ee but that we might have our &s;hare in it (in an ordinary cour&s;e of Pro|vidence) as well as formerly, and as well as other Coun|tries who have no <HI>Mines</HI> but receive it only by Com|merce. Po&s;&s;ibly the Ingenious may have many <HI>Schemes</HI> and <HI>Projections,</HI> to bring and keep <HI>Money</HI> in the Coun|try, but I can think of none &s;o hone&s;t and likely, as to make our <HI>Export</HI> exceed our <HI>Import,</HI> which by Indu&s;try and Frugality (with an ordinary ble&s;&s;ing) we might ea&s;ily do. We can't be &s;o <HI>Sanguine</HI> as to think, that other Countries will give us <HI>Money</HI> for nothing; if we have it of them, it mu&s;t be by way of Exchange for &s;ome Produce of our Country, or the Fruit of our Labour. It therefore we make our <HI>Export</HI> exceed our <HI>Import,</HI> it mu&s;t needs bring and keep <HI>Money</HI> here, and I'm humbly of Opinion, that no other method will be effectual to do it. If a Private <HI>Family,</HI> be&s;ides what they &s;pend of their own <HI>Produce</HI> rai&s;e <HI>Twenty Pounds</HI> worth for a <HI>Market</HI> Year|ly, and Yearly Buy <HI>Thirty Pounds,</HI> then they're <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> in Debt and behind hand. But if of the <HI>Twenty</HI> they <HI>Sell,</HI> they lay out but half, then they're <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> before hand, they have it ready to &s;erve their occa&s;ions. And if the Province in general would do thus with refe|rence to other Countries, would it not bring <HI>Money</HI> here. I think all the Province in their various Capaci|ties &s;hould endeavour this; and none more (with Sub|mi&s;&s;ion) than you in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>I humbly conceive, your ca&s;e as loudly calls for pity and &s;ome &s;peedy methods of redre&s;s, as the Ca&s;e of any Town in the Province, if not more. Your thriving (hu|manely &s;peaking) depends on the numerou&s;ne&s;s of your People; and their being &s;uitably imployed. But don't your numbers of late decrea&s;e? has not the low e&s;teem of Bills &s;o rai&s;ed the price of nece&s;&s;aries, That <HI>Trade&s;|men</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="002010_0021_0FBA7D1A682CED68">
and <HI>Labourers</HI> can &s;carce &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Is not their being put off with half <HI>Money,</HI> and half <HI>Goods,</HI> a great damage to them? Be&s;ides this, if they're Diligent and receive great wages (as the hirer thinks) yet that wages &s;uffi|ceth not to payment; <HI>Rates,</HI> to buy <HI>Wood, Food, Cloath|ing,</HI> &amp;c. Have not the&s;e difficulties cau&s;ed many of your Laborious People to move out of your Town? and if the&s;e difficulties continue and grow, wont they drive a|way more? And do's not this thining of your <HI>Laborious Inhabitants,</HI> tend to hurt and weaken you? If your Members continue to decrea&s;e, &s;ome of your wealthy Men may rather be called owners of Hou&s;es and Shops, than Land-Lords, for they'l &s;carce have Tenants to hire them, or if they have, the continued high price for ne|ce&s;&s;aries, will render them unable to pay rent, and po&s;&s;i|bly make them a Charge to the <HI>Town</HI> too. If this be not the pre&s;ent A&s;pect of the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of Affairs, then I'm mi&s;taken in my gue&s;s.</P>
<P>Therefore I think Wi&s;dom and Intere&s;t &s;hould move you, to endeavour in your Station as far as fairly may be, to dimini&s;h the quantity and thereby rai&s;e the value, of Bills of Credit, that &s;o a reducing the price of nece&s;&s;a|ries may incourage your indu&s;trious Inhabitants to abide with you, and draw others &s;uch unto you. And for you to pitch on &s;ome proper methods, to promote <HI>In|du&s;try,</HI> &amp; <HI>Manufacture</HI> among you, that &s;o your People (by Gods ble&s;&s;ing) may live by the fruit of their La|bours, to me &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to prevent your farther <HI>Diminution,</HI> and to prevent your Poor being &s;o <HI>numerous,</HI> that their Neighbours will &s;carce be able to Support them, but rather be obliged to Sink with them; I've heard that you in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> are very charitable, ready to give Alms, and I believe it; Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome think, if good Part of what's thus be&s;towed, were put into a <HI>Stock</HI> to imploy the Poor, it might be better for your Town. You lay up <HI>Grain</HI> in Store to &s;upply your Inhabitants, I &s;uppo&s;e it prudent to do &s;o, But if your Inhabitants
<PB N="22" REF="002010_0022_0FBA7D1E3667BFE8">
by the produce of their Labour, can't pay for it, it's but a &s;orrowful Ca&s;e &s;till.</P>
<P>You may think on two things. Would not the &s;ettling of a <HI>Market</HI> help you? are there not many needle&s;s <HI>Re|tailers,</HI> who buy up <HI>Provi&s;ions</HI> and Sell them with ad|vance to their poorer Neighbours? Do not the Poor oppre&s;s the Poor in this? Is there no remedy for this? Would not a well regulated <HI>Market</HI> help you greatly? The Scripture frequently &s;peaks of <HI>Markets</HI> as u&s;ual in former times; And I &s;uppo&s;e the Ancient and Populous Cities who now u&s;e them, would by no means be without them.</P>
<P>If the Licences to Sell Drink among you, were great|ly dimini&s;hed, would not this help you? If I'm not greatly mi&s;-inform'd abundance of Co&s;t and Time is need|le&s;ly &s;pent among you in Drink, and even by the <HI>Poor</HI> that can't &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Alms.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>Retailing Drink promote, Trade.</HI> An&s;. It's the <HI>Re|dundance</HI> and <HI>Exce&s;s</HI> of it that I'm again&s;t. In this the Seller &s;pends his time, without rai&s;ing one farthings worth produce for Publick Good, and the buyer &s;pends Time and Co&s;t for what he had better be without. This is double damage to the Publick.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould now ask, whether a Law to make Bills equal to <HI>Money</HI> between Man and Man, and to make them an&s;wer Specialties that is Bonds for <HI>Silver</HI> &amp;c. would not ea&s;e our Difficulties and bring in <HI>Silver</HI> a|mong us.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I own my &s;elf unable to &s;ee thro' the Proprie|ty of &s;uch a Law. For I conceive it not ea&s;ie if po&s;&s;ible for humane Laws to change Mens minds about things?</P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>Law</HI> allows <HI>five per Cent. advance</HI> to Bills in Publick payments; and made the tender of them for payment (<HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1712) &s;ufficient to &s;top Executi|on, I &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Acts in favour of the Bills, yet Men don't e&s;teem them as Money, but will give (as I am told, Twelve Shillings in Bills for an Ounce
<PB N="23" REF="002010_0023_0FBA7D21076AF0E8">
of Silver, which Ounce by our Law is but a &s;mall matter above Seven Shillings; A Law indeed might lay re|&s;traints and threaten Penalties, but it can't change Men's minds, to make them think a piece of Paper is a piece of Money, They'll not readily believe &s;uch a Tran&s;ub&s;tanti|ation, if Men really think that Silver is more for their profit than Bills, I don't &s;ee how a Law to make them equal in Trade, can univer&s;ally govern their Practice in buying and &s;elling which are voluntary actions; For if the Law &s;hould threaten a Fine to him, that would ask Twenty Five Shillings in Bills for Twenty Shillings in Silver, yet if a man ask me whether I'll &s;ell &s;uch a Com|modity I have; I may &s;urely ask him how much he'll give and in what. And if he offers me Twenty Five Shil|ings in Bills, I may refu&s;e it if I plea&s;e, who can oblige me to Sell? When yet if he offered Twenty Shillings in Sil|ver, po&s;&s;ibly I might gladly receive it.</P>
<P>I readily grant, that a Law to make Bills and Money equal in Trade, might probably make &s;ome alteration in practice; but as to the Expedience of &s;uch a Law, I he&s;itate, and &s;ubmit it to wi&s;er Judgments.</P>
<P>As to the other part. <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> To make Bills to an&s;wer Specialties, I'm at pre&s;ent not able to &s;ee thro' the fair|ne&s;s and hone&s;ty of it.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h Men are ju&s;tly Fond of Property as well as Li|berty. If I have Land or Goods to &s;ell, I may ask a price I think proper; If none will gave it, I keep what's my own. If any offer to buy, I may ask how much they'll give and in what? if they offer to pay me in Gold, I may refu&s;e it, if I chu&s;e Silver rather, and if we make a plain hone&s;t Bargain, the buyer is obliged to pay me &s;o much Silver in &s;uch a time; &s;urely I may ju&s;tly claim it, when the Time's expired, if he neglects to pay and I thereupon &s;ue him, would not any hone&s;t <HI>Jurors</HI> and <HI>Judges</HI> find and declare for the Plantiff? In matters of <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI> as they're called, I think the common rules of Ju&s;tice and Equity would &s;ay; that
<PB N="24" REF="002010_0024_0FBA7D22812D0A68">
none but he to whom the Obligation is made, can fairly relea&s;e or le&s;&s;en that Obligation; If I Sold Land a Year ago, and the Buyer was obliged to pay me &s;o much Silver for it, at the Term of Two Years; and a Law comes between and &s;ays, I &s;hall take <HI>Bills</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Silver,</HI> am not I a &s;ufferer? I think Laws are commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to look forward, and not backward. The Law in <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1712. which made the offer of Bills for payment &s;ufficient to &s;top Execution for Debts, contracted &s;ince <HI>Octob.</HI> 30. 1705. yet did it on this foot, as appears from the <HI>Preamble,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That &s;uch Debts were generally un|der&s;tood to be contracted for Bills. And &s;o that Law, ju&s;tly made an exception for <HI>Specialties,</HI> and expre&s;s Contracts in Writing. If you &s;ay, But to make Bills an&s;wer <HI>Specialties,</HI> would be an ea&s;e to many poor Debtors. <HI>Reply.</HI> But if it's unju&s;t and inju|rious to Creditors (whether poor or rich) who dare plead for it? God him&s;elf has &s;aid, <HI>he &s;hall do no un|righteou&s;ne&s;s in judgment, thou &s;halt not re&s;pect the per&s;on of the Poor; nor honour the per&s;on of the migh|ty. Neither &s;halt thou Countenance a poor man in his cau&s;e. Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Equity</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;erved between Debtor and Creditor; whether they're rich or poor.</P>
<P>If you &s;ay, What then &s;hall tho&s;e do who are obliged by their own voluntary Bonds to pay Silver, now there's no Silver pa&s;&s;ing? <HI>Reply,</HI> I would advice &s;uch Debtors to beg forbearance in their Creditors, and &s;ay to them, (&s;ubmitting to Providence,) Have patience with me and I'll pay thee all; and let them hone&s;tly and indu&s;triou&s;ly indeavour to do &s;o. And I would advi&s;e Creditors to a|void extremities, vigour, not needle&s;ly take their Brother by the Throat; nor gladly catch at an advantage, to &s;queeze from a Debtor, twice &s;o much in value, merely becau&s;e he can't get Money. Whatever advantage we may happen to have by any humane Laws, yet con&s;idered as <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> we can't be exempted from that rule, <HI>As ye would that Men &s;hould do unto you, do ye al&s;o to</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="002010_0025_0FBA7D28E6B28A38">
<HI>them likewi&s;e;</HI> we &s;hould rather &s;uffer &s;ome damage our&s;elves, than bring a very great one on our Neigh|bours. I pre&s;ume that as Bills decrea&s;e in quantity they'll increa&s;e in value, and gradually before they are all in, be as good as <HI>Money.</HI> Therefore <HI>Indu&s;try, Hone&s;ty, Frugality</HI> in him that's under Bonds, and Patience and Forbearance in him that hath the <HI>Obligation</HI> (&s;o far as he well can) &s;eems the be&s;t way to prevent very great wrong, either to <HI>Debtor</HI> or <HI>Creditor.</HI> This advice re|fers e&s;pecially to Hone&s;t Indu&s;trious Debtors, for if a per&s;on is in my Debt, and yet lives idly, extravagantly, is in no likely way to pay what he owes, but rather to &s;pend and wa&s;te the Sub&s;tance of <HI>Creditors,</HI> then what rea&s;on is there I &s;hould forbear him? Why &s;hould I &s;uffer my Sub&s;tance (gotten by hone&s;t In|du&s;try) to be wa&s;ted in gratifying his <HI>Pride, Idle|ne&s;s or Extravagance,</HI> If thro' his Extravagance he's not able to pay <HI>Fifty per Cent.</HI> why &s;hould I &s;uffer him to go on till he can't pay <HI>Twenty Five?</HI> I pre|&s;ume many are now convinced, that the giving too much and too long Credit has been hurtful both to the Per&s;ons tru&s;ting and tru&s;ted, and 'twill be well if there don't &s;peedily appear many more proofs of this.</P>
<P>As I would not advi&s;e any <HI>Creditor</HI> rigorou&s;ly to take the advantage of his <HI>Debtor,</HI> &s;o neither would I advi&s;e any Friend of mine, if he were <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>able,</HI> to hoard up <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> meerly to make his Neighbours buy them with Silver at legal weight, to pay their <HI>Taxes</HI> with. I &s;ay I would not advi&s;e any Friend of mine to <HI>hoard up Bills</HI> for this pur|po&s;e, le&s;t he &s;hould get that Di&s;plea&s;ure from Hea|ven which will be more bitter to him than all his <HI>gain</HI> by it, on Earth, would be &s;weet.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002010_0026_0FBA7D2B54F9C428">
Since we &s;hould <HI>love our Neighbour as our &s;elves,</HI> how can we receive <HI>Bills</HI> of them at the low Value they're now of; and yet lay them by on purpo&s;e to make them Pay us near twice as much for them in a little time? I de&s;ire no &s;uch Gain. And if any &s;hould hoard up <HI>Bills,</HI> thinking in a few Years to be paid for them out of the Trea&s;ury in <HI>Silver,</HI> at Legal Weight, they may po&s;&s;ibly find them&s;elves mi&s;taken. For they are to be received for <HI>any Stock</HI> in the Trea&s;ury, and if the <HI>Government</HI> &s;hould &s;ee meet as <HI>Bills</HI> grow few and &s;carce, to take &s;omething el&s;e <HI>be&s;ides Silver</HI> for <HI>Rates,</HI> whether <HI>Grain, Flax, Hemp,</HI> &amp;c. po&s;&s;ibly when Per&s;ons come to have their <HI>Bills</HI> paid for, they may be obliged to take <HI>&s;uch things</HI> as &s;hall <HI>then</HI> be in the Trea&s;ury. I humbly con|ceive therefore, it's mo&s;t fair, hone&s;t and neighbourly to keep the <HI>Bills pa&s;&s;ing in Commerce,</HI> till they're gradu|ally called in and burnt, and not to hoard them up from any <HI>Private veiws</HI> or thir&s;t after <HI>Self-Intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Sir, out of true Love to my Country, who&s;e Welfare I heartily wi&s;h and aim at, and without being asked by any one, or de&s;igning to flatter or di&s;gu&s;t any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons what&s;oever, I have once more open'd my Thoughts to you; I don't offer them with an impo&s;ing air, but mode&s;tly &s;ubmit them to Cen&s;ure. If upon Scaning what's offered, you &s;ee rea|&s;on to fault any Sentiments therein, plea&s;e to A&s;cribe it to the want of <HI>more Skill,</HI> and not want of <HI>Good-Will,</HI> to promote the Publick Welfare.
