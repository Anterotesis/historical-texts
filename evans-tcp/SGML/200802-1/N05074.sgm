<Q><L><HI>And he &s;aid al&s;o to the people, When ye &s;ee a cloud ri&s;e out of the we&s;t, &s;traightway ye &s;ay, There cometh a &s;hower; and &s;o it is.</HI></L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the words of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: and the occa&s;ion of them &s;eems to have been as follows&mdash;He had been preach|ing the go&s;pel in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the neigh|bouring cities of the <HI>Jews;</HI> and had, by the purity of his doctrine, the holine&s;s of his life, together with the nature and number of his miracles, convinced many per&s;ons, that he was the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah that was to come,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="006365_0005_1028AF0C08EF0C60">
and that they were not to <HI>look for another.</HI> However the chief of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> rejected him as an impo&s;tor, attributing his miraculous works to the power of <HI>magic,</HI> or his &s;uppo&s;ed familiarity with <HI>evil &s;pirits.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is ea&s;y to &s;ee what an influence this conduct of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> in vilifying our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, mu&s;t unavoidably have upon the generality of the people. For they were in the highe&s;t e&s;teem among&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> both becau&s;e they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have the deepe&s;t in&s;ight into things of a religious nature, and, at the &s;ame time, to be men of extraordinary piety. This favourable opinion concerning them, was indeed ill-grounded. But they had the talent of impo&s;ing upon the people, in great perfection; and, in fact, managed matters with &s;o much craft and &s;ubtilty, that they were thought almo&s;t the only &s;aints in the world, and the great oracles to be con&s;ulted upon all occa&s;ions. The people placed an implicit faith in their dogma's and deci&s;ions. Nothing was thought to bear the genuine &s;tamp of truth, unle&s;s they had had the coining of it: And their cen&s;ure of any particular per&s;on, or doctrine, was &s;ufficient to make either of them odious to the multitude.</P>
<P>WHEN, therefore, the&s;e infalliable guides &s;tigmatized our Lord as an ill man; when they reproached him as one, who, without any rea&s;on or authority, was attempt|ing to di&s;credit certain opinions which they had <HI>received to have and to hold from their fore-fathers;</HI> when they accu&s;ed him of making innovations in the old e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, to the great hazard of the &s;ouls of men; I &s;ay, when they talked and railed in this <HI>pious &s;train,</HI> it gave a general alarm to the people, e&s;pecially to the <HI>&s;uper&s;ti|tious vulgar;</HI> and expo&s;ed our Lord to their contempt and hatred and in&s;ults. They gave them&s;elves no far|ther trouble to inquire into the grounds of his preten&s;ions to the <HI>me&s;&s;iah-&s;hip;</HI> concluding that <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t needs be a
<PB N="3" REF="006365_0006_1028AF532BF674A0">
deceiver, who was condemned by &s;uch a learned and holy body of men, as that of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI></P>
<P>FEW of them conde&s;cended &s;o far as to come and hear him preach, (this being repre&s;ented to them as dangerous) that &s;o they might know what he had to &s;ay for him&s;elf: and tho&s;e that did, came rather as &s;pies, that they might find occa&s;ion to cavil, and to ac|cu&s;e him to the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> than with &s;uch an unprejudiced and candid di&s;po&s;ition as became inquirers after the truth.</P>
<P>BUT although the generality of the <HI>Jews</HI> were &s;uch abject &s;laves to the dictates of their &s;piritual in&s;truc|tors, never daring to he&s;itate concerning the truth of what they a&s;&s;erted upon religious &s;ubjects, but receiving every thing, how ab&s;urd &s;oever, with all the humility of implicit faith; yet it &s;eems, that in their <HI>temporal</HI> and <HI>worldly</HI> concerns, they were cautious enough. Here they were not fond of taking up &s;atisfied with any man's word; but were forward to think, inquire and judge for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;hort character of the people to whom our Lord &s;peaks in the text. And this being kept in view, his addre&s;s will appear very natural and &s;ea&s;onable.&mdash;<HI>And he &s;aid al&s;o to the people, When ye &s;ee a cloud ri&s;e out of the we&s;t, &s;traightway ye &s;ay, There cometh a &s;hower; and &s;o it is. And when ye &s;ee the &s;outh-wind blow, ye &s;ay there will be heat; and it cometh to pa&s;s. Ye hypocrites, ye can di&s;cern the face of the &s;ky, and of the earth: but how is it, that ye do not di&s;cern this time? Yea, and why even of your &s;elves judge ye not what is right?</HI></P>
<P>THESE Words &s;eem to be very plain of them&s;elves: but the &s;en&s;e of them may be expre&s;&s;ed more at large in the following paraphra&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006365_0007_1028AF0EE0A74890">
<Q>AND after the&s;e things, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were generally prejudiced again&s;t him, thro' their blind attachment to their &s;piritual guides; and &s;aid&mdash;Ye that &s;uffer your&s;elves to be led blind|fold by others, with regard to me and my doctrine, and things of a religious concern in general, are never|thele&s;s &s;agacious enough in matters of equal difficulty, and much le&s;s importance&mdash;Ye are apt and &s;kilful enough at di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;igns and tokens of things that are to come to pa&s;s in the natural world, in which your pre&s;ent intere&s;t is concerned.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Clarke's</HI> paraphra&s;e.</NOTE> Ye can, (for example) by ob&s;erving the colour of the &s;ky, and the blowing of the wind, form a true judg|ment concerning the future change of the weather. How comes it to pa&s;s, then, ye deluded hypocrites, that amid&s;t all your &s;agacity in things that relate to the pre&s;ent world, ye are &s;till blind and undi&s;cerning in things of a religious nature? why do not ye that can pre&s;age various changes from the appearance of the earth and heavens, di&s;cern al&s;o the periods and revolutions of things; the various di&s;pen&s;ations of providence in the moral world? In particular, how comes it to pa&s;s that ye do not di&s;tingui&s;h the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, in which God is erecting a new di&s;pen&s;ation, to &s;ucceed that of <HI>Mo&s;es?</HI> There are &s;igns and tokens enough to convince you that &s;uch a revolution is now taking place, if ye would but examine them atten|tively. Why, then, will ye &s;uffer your&s;elves to be blinded by the authority of the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> when God has given you &s;ufficient abilities to gain the knowledge of the truth? Why will ye not exert your own faculties, and judge for your&s;elves what is true and right in this matter, as ye do in things of a worldly nature?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006365_0008_1028AF54B04DC0D0">
THUS I have endeavoured to give a true idea of the original &s;cope and meaning of the words which I have cho&s;en for the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e. I &s;hall now wave every thing in them peculiar to the time and circum&s;tances wherein they were &s;poken; and ob&s;erve from them &s;everal univer&s;al truths which concern all times and per&s;ons and places alike.</P>
<P>As
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THAT there is a natural difference betwixt truth and fal&s;hood, right and wrong.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT men are naturally endowed with faculties proper for the di&s;cerning of the&s;e differences.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>and la&s;tly,</HI> THAT men are under obligation to ex|ert the&s;e faculties; and to judge for them&s;elves in things of a religious concern.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. THEN, there is a natural difference betwixt truth and fal&s;hood, right and wrong.&mdash;<HI>Why even of your&s;elves judge ye not what is</HI> right?</P>
<P>BY <HI>what is right,</HI> it is probable that our Saviour here more immediately intends, what is <HI>true;</HI> for his di&s;cour&s;e in this place turns upon <HI>examining, judging,</HI> and <HI>inferring</HI> one thing from another. But whether by this term we under&s;tand, what is <HI>true in theory,</HI> or what is <HI>right in practice,</HI> it will come to much the &s;ame thing at la&s;t; for there is an in&s;eparable connexion betwixt them. If certain things are <HI>true</HI> in &s;peculation, there mu&s;t be &s;ome corre&s;pondent <HI>fitne&s;s</HI> of actions re&s;ulting therefrom. And, on the other hand, if any thing be allowed <HI>fit</HI> in a practical &s;en&s;e, that <HI>fitne&s;s</HI> or <HI>rightne&s;s</HI> mu&s;t be founded in certain <HI>truths</HI> and <HI>relations</HI> before &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. I &s;hall, therefore, take it for granted, that the text &s;uppo&s;es, That there is in nature both a <HI>True,</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;peculative <HI>Error;</HI> and a <HI>Right,</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from
<PB N="6" REF="006365_0009_1028AF1065915EE0">
<HI>Wrong</HI> in <HI>Conduct.</HI> And the remainder of this di&s;cour&s;e will be taken up with the&s;e important di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>INDEED the &s;pending of time to prove that there are really &s;uch differences as tho&s;e mentioned, may appear to &s;ome to be rather childi&s;h impertinence, or formal trifling, than a proper employment for rea&s;onable Crea|tures, it being &s;uch a plain and obvious truth. However it is to be remembered, that no notion is too ab&s;urd to de&s;erve to be refuted, while &s;ome are ab&s;urd enough to propagate, and others to believe, it: e&s;pecially if it be &s;uch an one as &s;trikes at the root of all religion, and every thing wherein the happine&s;s of mankind con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>AND &s;uch is the notion of an ab&s;olute indifference in nature with relation to truth and fal&s;hood, right and wrong. For this being allowed, it follows that we have no invariable rule of life and conduct. No man, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition is under a po&s;&s;ibility either of judging or acting <HI>ami&s;s;</HI> or of the contrary. Each man <HI>thinks</HI> as ju&s;tly as another, how contrary &s;oever his &s;entiments are: And &s;o al&s;o each one <HI>acts</HI> as rightly as any other, let him act how he will. This is to make &s;hort work with all que&s;tions and debates concerning truth, religion, and the rule of human conduct: it &s;uper&s;edes all inquiries about them, by pre&s;uppo&s;ing that they have no exi&s;tence but in the idea of certain doting men who have employed them&s;elves in inventing arbitrary di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>THERE &s;eem to have been two <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of <HI>Scepticks</HI> in the World: one of which exploded the whole notion of truth and right, as oppo&s;ed to fal&s;hood and wrong con|duct: and another which &s;eemingly allowed &s;uch differ|ences to have an exi&s;tence in nature; but held it impo&s;|&s;ible for <HI>us</HI> to <HI>di&s;cern</HI> them. It is only the fir&s;t of the&s;e opinions that we are concerned with at pre&s;ent; the latter will be con&s;idered in our next di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="006365_0010_1028AF577598F668">
To begin with <HI>truth</HI>&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding what &s;ome are plea&s;ed to pronounce with their lips concerning the indifference of truth and fal&s;hood, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible but that their hearts &s;hould be at variance with their mouths, and give them the <HI>lie,</HI> even while they are de|nying there is any &s;uch thing as <HI>fal&s;hood.</HI> For if there be any thing <HI>exi&s;ting,</HI> (which &s;urely no body was ever &s;o ab&s;urd as to deny) there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;uch a thing as truth; truth, as ab&s;tracted from mind or intel|ligence, being nothing di&s;tinct from the real nature and properties of things exi&s;ting. Whatever exi&s;ts, has a real exi&s;tence; and if &s;o, it cannot be true that it has no exi&s;tence. Whatever has a being, mu&s;t al&s;o exi&s;t in <HI>&s;ome certain, determinate manner;</HI> with &s;uch and &s;uch properties, affections and attributes; with &s;uch and &s;uch proportions, a&s;pects and relations. And we can as little alter <HI>the&s;e</HI> by our opinions, as we can cau&s;e the things them&s;elves to exi&s;t and not exi&s;t, alternately, as our thoughts vary concerning them. Thus truth is &s;ome|what determinate in it&s;elf; it exi&s;ts indpendently of our notions concerning it: And the preci&s;e boundaries be|twixt <HI>that,</HI> and <HI>fal&s;hood,</HI> are al&s;o determined by the real nature and properties of things, whether they are per|ceptible to us, or not.</P>
<P>TRUTH, as it exi&s;ts in the <HI>mind,</HI> is nothing but the perception or knowledge of that independent truth now mentioned; or a knowledge of things as they really exi&s;t. And as it relates to <HI>words</HI> and <HI>propo&s;itions,</HI> it is nothing but the <HI>right</HI> u&s;e of certain arbitrary &s;igns, having a meaning annexed to them by common con&s;ent; i. e. the u&s;ing them in &s;uch a manner that they &s;hall be con|formable to, and expre&s;&s;ive of, the real nature and pro|perties of the thing treated of.</P>
<P>To return&mdash;Can any man think it equally true that he does, and that he does not, exi&s;t? I in&s;tance in this, becau&s;e it is familiar; but the &s;ame que&s;tion may be
<PB N="8" REF="006365_0011_1028AF13718DDE08">
a&s;ked concerning every thing el&s;e. This is an univer&s;al dilemma, applicable to every thing that comes under con|&s;ideration&mdash;"It is, or it is not." No middle way can be taken. This is indeed no new di&s;covery: it is &s;elf-evident, and a fir&s;t principle.</P>
<P>THUS, that we either do, or do not, conver&s;e with &s;en&s;ible objects, &s;o that one may be truly affirmed, and the other denied, is as plain as it is, that we either do, or do not exi&s;t. We may proceed in the &s;ame manner to con&s;ider things, which, if they exi&s;t at all, lie beyond the reach of our animal &s;en&s;es. It is as certain in it&s;elf, that there are, or that there are not, &s;piritual and invi|&s;ible agents, as it is that there are, or are not &s;en&s;ible ob|jects. And with relation to the being of a GOD, it is as plain, that there is, or that there is not, &s;uch a <HI>Being,</HI> as that there are, or are not, invi&s;ible agents in general.</P>
<P>WE may de&s;cend in the &s;ame way to all the particular que&s;tions that have ari&s;en concerning the particular na|ture of this <HI>Being,</HI> upon &s;uppo&s;ition he exi&s;ts&mdash;concern|ing the nature of his government&mdash;concerning the reality of a revelation from him&mdash;concerning the im|mortality of our &s;ouls, &amp;c. There mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a <HI>true</HI> and a <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> with relation to every que&s;tion that can be propo&s;ed, or come into our minds. We cannot &s;o much as doubt of the truth of any particular propo&s;i|tion, without &s;uppo&s;ing that truth lies on one &s;ide or the other.</P>
<P>IT will be ob&s;erved that I have not attempted to de|termine any of the above-mentioned que&s;tions. This was beyond my pre&s;ent de&s;ign. All I aim at, is to &s;how, that there is, and mu&s;t be, a natural di&s;tinction betwixt truth and error, in <HI>general;</HI> a di&s;tinction which does not depend upon the precarious humours and opinions of men: Whatever judgment we may form in any particular
<PB N="9" REF="006365_0012_1028AF58FA146880">
ca&s;e, it no ways affects the truth of it. Truth &s;till re|mains the &s;ame &s;imple, uniform, con&s;i&s;tent thing, amid&s;t all the various and contrary opinions of mankind con|cerning it.</P>
<P>THE natural di&s;tinction betwixt truth and fal&s;hood being exploded, &s;uch paradoxes as the&s;e mu&s;t follow&mdash;That no man's opinions are either <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong</HI>&mdash;That however contrary the &s;entiments of different men are to one another, they are both equally conformable to the nature and reality of the things they judge upon&mdash;That there are neither any knowing nor any fooli&s;h men in the world&mdash;That what we u&s;ually call wi&s;dom and folly, are the &s;ame&mdash;And, what is &s;tranger than all, That the&s;e paradoxes are neither true nor fal&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>IF there be any &s;uch thing as wi&s;dom, as oppo&s;ed to ignorance and folly, it con&s;i&s;ts in knowing the truth; and a man is wi&s;e in the &s;ame degree that he does &s;o. There is no knowledge, but of &s;ome truth or fact: Or, in other words, knowledge pre&s;uppo&s;es the being of truth, or &s;omething to be known. Now if there be no &s;uch thing as truth, there is nothing to be known: and con&s;equently every man, yea, every being whatever, mu&s;t be intirely ignorant and de&s;titute of knowledge; as de|&s;titute of it, not only as <HI>the hor&s;e and mule which have no under&s;tanding,</HI> but as any part of &s;en&s;ele&s;s inanimate mat|ter. So that notwith&s;tanding all the noi&s;e there has been in the world about wi&s;dom and folly; notwith|&s;tanding the univer&s;al applau&s;e that has been be&s;towed on &s;ome per&s;ons, as gloriou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of mankind by a happy <HI>genius</HI> and peculiar <HI>&s;agacity;</HI> yet in reality all this is at bottom nothing but empty words without any meaning at all. <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Plato, Locke</HI> and <HI>Newton,</HI> were not &s;uperiour, in point of wi&s;dom, to the mo&s;t illiterate hu&s;band-man. Nay; upon this &s;up|po&s;ition, even <HI>Pyrrho</HI> and <HI>Arce&s;ilaus</HI> them&s;elves, the great leaders of the <HI>&s;ceptic</HI> tribe, knew no more than tho&s;e

whom they upbraided with their ignorance. This, in|deed, is a con&s;equence which the <HI>Pyrrhoni&s;ts</HI> will hardly be per&s;waded to own. For there are none more apt than they, to value them&s;elves upon their &s;uperiour wi&s;dom and penetration. And they plea&s;e them&s;elves in par|ticular with the thought of their being the di&s;coverers of this mighty <HI>arcanum,</HI> that there is no &s;uch thing as truth, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from error. But if there be no &s;uch thing as truth, why will they plea&s;e them&s;elves for their &s;agacity in making this di&s;covery? Or why will they endeavour to bring others over to their opinion, when by their fir&s;t, and I might add, their only, principle, tho&s;e <HI>others</HI> are no more in an error than them&s;elves. Such is the perplexity, the endle&s;s labyrinth, that a man brings him&s;elf into, by a&s;&s;erting for truth, that there is no &s;uch thing as truth.</P>
<P>WE are indeed left intirely in the dark with re&s;pect to many things; our knowledge is, at be&s;t, but of &s;mall extent; and the opinions of men are various. It is this that has given &s;ome men occa&s;ion to confound truth and error, as though there were in nature no differ|ence betwixt them. But I hope it is needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing more in oppo&s;ition to an opinion &s;o directly contrary to common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the other di&s;tinction mentioned above; the di&s;tinction betwixt <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> in <HI>conduct</HI> And, as it was before ob&s;erved, &s;uch a di&s;tinction mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily take place in con&s;equence of the former. There are, perhaps, &s;ome things &s;o indifferent as no ways to affect practice, whether they are true or fal&s;e. But there are other principles which, being allowed true, imme|diately induce upon us an obligation to act in a <HI>particu|lar, determinate manner;</HI> &s;o that to act thus &s;hall be <HI>right</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable;</HI> and to do the contrary <HI>unfit</HI> and <HI>wrong.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006365_0014_1028AF5CE8834AC8">
THUS, for example, it being &s;uppo&s;ed, That there is &s;ome particular cour&s;e or method of acting, which tends to promote our happine&s;s upon the whole; and that a contrary conduct tends to our mi&s;ery, (which by the way are not bare &s;uppo&s;itions, but plain facts) a fitne&s;s of the former cour&s;e of action, in oppo&s;ition to the latter, nece&s;&s;arily follows. For happine&s;s being in it&s;elf a <HI>good,</HI> and mi&s;ery an <HI>evil,</HI> it is in it&s;elf right and rea&s;onable to pur&s;ue the former, and to avoid the latter. If to this we add, (which experience &s;hows to be fact al&s;o) that the &s;ame cour&s;e of action which tends to <HI>private</HI> hap|pine&s;s, tends to <HI>publick</HI> al&s;o, this lays us under a twofold obligation to take that cour&s;e. For it is in it&s;elf right to do good to others, as well as to our&s;elves, happine&s;s being as valuable to them as it is to us. From this general principle our obligation to what is u&s;ually called moral and &s;ocial virtue; to fidelity, ju&s;tice, charity; to humility and temperance, may be ea&s;ily inferred. For it is appa|rent, from experience, that by the &s;teady, uniform prac|tice of the&s;e virtues, both the good of individuals, and of the publick, is promoted. Indeed it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible but that &s;uch a practice as tends to the good of one, &s;hould tend to the good of the other al&s;o. For publick happine&s;s is nothing but the happine&s;s of a <HI>number</HI> of <HI>in|dividuals</HI> united in &s;ociety: So that if the individuals of which the &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ts, be happy, the community mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be happy al&s;o. And on the other hand, the <HI>community</HI> is rendered mi&s;erable in the &s;ame degree that <HI>individuals</HI> are &s;o. Virtue, then, is what we are under obligation to practi&s;e, without the con&s;ideration of the being of a God, or of a future &s;tate, barely from its apparent tendency to make mankind happy at pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>AGAIN, let us &s;uppo&s;e, (what is at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;eable) That there is a God; a being who created, and who governs the world, in infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s: i.e. in &s;uch a manner as to communicate the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="12" REF="006365_0015_1028AF191F49D3A0">
happine&s;s to his creatures con&s;idered collectively.&mdash;This being is plainly the object of e&s;teem, gratitude, love, reverence, tru&s;t, &amp;c. to all his rational creatures. His character is in it&s;elf amiable and perfect. To treat him with contempt, or di&s;regard, is to treat him as being what he <HI>is not;</HI> which certainly cannot be <HI>right. Piety,</HI> therefore, is what we are under obligation to, upon &s;up|po&s;ition there is any &s;uch being as this, exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>BUT farther&mdash;If there be &s;uch a being, he is <HI>perfect</HI> in all moral excellence, and therefore we, and all other intelligent beings, are under obligation to copy after, and imitate, him, according to the condition and capa|city of our natures, without the con&s;ideration of his en|joining it upon us by any expre&s;s and po&s;itive law. For &s;o far as we fall &s;hort of him, we fall &s;hort of per|fection, according to the &s;uppo&s;ition, he being the rule and &s;tandard of perfection. And &s;o, on the other hand, we are perfect, in proportion as we re&s;emble him in the tem|per of our minds; and imitate him in the conduct of our lives. And this brings us in another way, to the former conclu&s;ion, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That we are under obligation to practi&s;e what is u&s;ually called moral virtue; for by this we imitate God: and fall in with his benevolent de&s;ign in creating and governing the world.</P>
<P>AGAIN&mdash;It follows upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch a being, That his declared will ought to be univer&s;ally the rule of our actions, in whatever manner it is made known to us, whether by natural <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> or &s;upernatural <HI>revela|tion;</HI> and whether we are able to &s;ee the rea&s;on and grounds of his injunctions, or not. For, properly &s;peak|ing, our obligation to obey the commands of &s;uch a being as knows and wills always what is be&s;t, does not ari&s;e in any degree from the particular <HI>manner</HI> in which we come to the knowledge of his commands; or from our &s;eeing the grounds of them: but &s;olely from our knowing that they are <HI>in fact</HI> his commands: Thus if
<PB N="13" REF="006365_0016_1028AF5FA7868BA8">
this being has, commanded us, be&s;ides practi&s;ing &s;uch moral virtues as tho&s;e mentioned above, to do certain things not dictated by the light of nature; if he has commanded us to &s;ubmit our&s;elves to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of <HI>Nazareth</HI> as <HI>his</HI> Son and Delegate, and <HI>our</HI> Lord and Ma&s;ter; we ought to comply immediately with his will, a&s;&s;oon as it is made known to us. For it is apparently wrong and unrea&s;onable to thwart the will and authority of him who is infinitely wi&s;e and good, although he had no power to cha&s;tize us for it. It will not &s;o much as bear a di&s;pute, whether it is wrong or not, to act counter to the injuncti|ons of that being in <HI>any</HI> ca&s;e, who in <HI>every</HI> ca&s;e injoins that, and that only, which is rea&s;onable for him to in|join.&mdash;If he command with wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, we cannot di&s;obey without folly and wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT after all, there is really no nece&s;&s;ity of going &s;o far to find our obligation to what is u&s;ually called <HI>moral virtue,</HI> as to con&s;ider its tendency to happine&s;s; its ren|dering us like to God, the &s;tandard of perfection; or to inquire whether the practice of it be injoined upon us by the po&s;itive will and command of God. We may find the grounds of this obligation nearer home, even in our own brea&s;ts. There is &s;uch a <HI>law written in our hearts;</HI> &s;uch an internal con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the moral excellency of virtue, and of the odiou&s;ne&s;s of its contrary, as really leaves us no room to doubt of our obligation to it; and &s;o, in a great mea&s;ure &s;uper&s;edes all other arguments. For we cannot ordinarily violate the rules of ju&s;tice, &amp;c. without violating our own minds at the &s;ame time; and turning our own accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>THE principal objection that can be urged again&s;t the moral difference of actions, is taken from the difficulty there is, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to determine the boundaries be|twixt right and wrong; the variety of opinions that have prevailed in the world concerning que&s;tions of right, e&s;pecially in political affairs; and the different, yea,
<PB N="14" REF="006365_0017_1028AF1D0F06C188">
contrary laws, enacted by wi&s;e men in different ages and countries, and all equally under the notion of their being right and equitable. <Q>But (to u&s;e the words of a learned writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. S. CLARKE.</NOTE>) as in painting, two very different colours, by diluting each other very &s;lowly and gradually, may, from the highe&s;t inten&s;ene&s;s in either extreme, terminate in the mid&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly; and &s;o run one into the other, that it &s;hall not be po&s;&s;ible even for a &s;kilful eye to determine exactly where the one ends and the other begins; and yet the colours differ as much as can be, not in <HI>degree</HI> only, but intirely in <HI>kind,</HI> as <HI>red</HI> and <HI>blue,</HI> or <HI>white</HI> and <HI>black:</HI> So though perhaps it may be very difficult in &s;ome nice and perplext ca&s;es (which yet are very far from occuring frequently) to define exactly the bounds of right and wrong, ju&s;t and unju&s;t, and there may be &s;ome latitude in the judgment of different Men, and the laws of divers nations; yet right and wrong are neverthe|le&s;s totally and e&s;&s;entially different; even altoge|ther as much as white and black, light and dark|ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>THE admirable writer who&s;e words I have here quoted, &s;eems very charitably to attribute men's intirely con|founding right and wrong, to the difficulty which they find in &s;ome ca&s;es, to determine what is right and equita|ble, and what wrong and injurious; or to di&s;cern the ter|minating line betwixt them. And this difficulty is doubt|le&s;s what gives men an opportunity to oppo&s;e the notion of &s;uch a moral difference in actions, under &s;ome little colour of argument. However an internal perception of the moral difference of things in general, is &s;o inter|woven with our very nature, that it is hardly credible that any man &s;hould really think all actions to be indif|ferent in their own nature. Or if any actually entertain &s;uch an opinion, it is not <HI>natural.</HI> It does not proceed
<PB N="15" REF="006365_0018_1028AF626610FAD8">
&s;o much from men's originally wanting clear ideas of the difference in general betwixt right and wrong, as from their having <HI>made</HI> the&s;e things indifferent, as far as their own <HI>practice</HI> could effect it. Men have naturally as clear a conception of the general difference betwixt moral good and evil, antecedent to all con&s;ideration of human laws and compacts, yea, to the con&s;ideration of the will of God him&s;elf, as they have of the difference betwixt light and darkne&s;s. But as the organs of &s;ight may be abu&s;ed and weakened to &s;uch a degree that a man &s;hall at la&s;t perceive no difference betwixt the night and the day: and as mo&s;t of our other animal &s;en&s;es may be perverted and debauched, &s;o as to be incapable of an|&s;wering their original de&s;ign; &s;o al&s;o men's natural con&s;ci|ence of good and evil, may, by frequent violations, lo&s;e its quickne&s;s; and the mind it&s;elf become blind, cal|lous and in&s;en&s;ible. Our natural &s;en&s;e of the moral dif|ference in actions and characters, may be rendered dull and u&s;ele&s;s. And thus the law written in the hearts of men by the finger of God him&s;elf, may be repealed, and era&s;ed by the powerful influence of vice: whereupon they deny that there was ever any &s;uch law engraved on their minds. This is ju&s;t as if <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when his <HI>anger wax|ed hot,</HI> and he ca&s;t the two <HI>tables of the law</HI> out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount, &s;hould have immediately denied that God had ever written them, or given them to him to pre&s;erve. It is natural for men of corrupt minds and morals, to endeavour to get rid of all unea&s;y reflections upon what is pa&s;t, and terrible pre|&s;ages of what may be future, by intirely throwing a&s;ide the di&s;tinction betwixt moral good and evil, as if the&s;e were but empty names without any meaning, invented by civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>tyrants</HI> to keep the world in awe.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, although the vices of men may go far towards darkning their under&s;tandings, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the mo&s;t degenerate of them ever arrive at
<PB N="16" REF="006365_0019_1028AF1E92BCCC78">
&s;uch a &s;tate of blindne&s;s as to have no real &s;en&s;e of the difference betwixt right and wrong, whatever they may pretend. For &s;uch a &s;en&s;e in &s;ome degree of it, &s;eems in&s;eparable from a rational nature: and cannot be totally extingui&s;hed, but with rea&s;on it&s;elf. And it is worth ob|&s;erving, That with how good a con&s;cience &s;oever the great ma&s;ters of <HI>&s;ceptici&s;m</HI> pretend they commit the mo&s;t flagrant immoralities, under the notion of all things being indifferent in their own nature; yet they cannot help betraying them&s;elves, and &s;howing their natural &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, upon certain occa&s;ions. For who are more aver&s;e than <HI>they,</HI> to take the character of <HI>knave</HI> to them&s;elves, though they generally take no care not to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> it? They chu&s;e to be e&s;teemed as men of hone&s;ty and integrity. And when it comes to their own turn to be injured, they are as ready as any of their neighbours to accu&s;e the aggre&s;&s;or of wrong and inju&s;tice. If their moral &s;en&s;e were before a&s;leep, &s;uffering injuries awakens it in a moment. And if they are not right down <HI>athei&s;ts,</HI> they are ready to think &s;trange that God &s;hould let his thunder &s;leep while &s;uch villanies are perpetrated.&mdash;Thus hard is it for men to di&s;gui&s;e the inward &s;entiments of their hearts in this ca&s;e: the ma&s;k will drop off, and nature peep out in &s;ome unguarded hour&mdash;</P>
<P>IF men would go no farther than to a&s;&s;ert, That there are &s;ome que&s;tions of right, &s;o intricate and complicated, that it is difficult, or even impo&s;&s;ible, to determine them, none would contradict them but &s;uch arrogant and con|ceited per&s;ons as imagine their knowledge has no limits. But when, not content with this, they boldly &s;trike at the foundation of every thing that is good and prai&s;e worthy, by denying the moral difference of actions in general; and yet upon every turn, are complaining of injuries and abu&s;es, done, or offered to them&s;elves; it is hard to &s;ay whether they are more proper objects of pity or contempt; of indignation or ridicule: For they have doubtle&s;s a good title to all.</P>

THERE can be no danger of being too &s;evere in cen|&s;uring men of this &s;tamp. For what they &s;ay concerning the ab&s;olute indifference of actions is either fal&s;e or true. If it be fal&s;e, nothing is too bad to be &s;aid of them for thus &s;etting a&s;ide the moral difference of actions; for putting the mo&s;t excellent virtues and the mo&s;t odious vices upon the &s;ame footing; for making it as in|nocent for a child to murther his aged parents, as to kill a viper; and to bla&s;pheme his Maker, as it is to deride a &s;ot; and, in this way, di&s;&s;olving all the ties and obligations both of private and of &s;ocial virtue. But, on the other hand, if what they a&s;&s;ert be true, there is not even a bare po&s;&s;ibility of injuring them; for there can be no &s;uch thing as wrong or injury, if all actions are ab&s;olutely indifferent in their own nature.</P>
<P>I hope it in &s;ome mea&s;ure appears from what has been &s;aid, That as <HI>truth</HI> has a real exi&s;tence in nature, &s;o the di&s;tinction betwixt <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> nece&s;&s;arily takes place in con&s;equence thereof.

<P>THE next thing propo&s;ed was to &s;how, That men are naturally endowed with faculties proper for the di&s;cerning of tho&s;e differences of which we have been &s;peaking. But this mu&s;t be left for the &s;ubject of another di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude for the pre&s;ent with an obvious infer|ence from what has been &s;aid; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That &s;ince <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>right</HI> have a real exi&s;tence in nature, independent on the <HI>&s;entiments</HI> and <HI>practices</HI> of men, they do not nece&s;&s;arily follow the multitude, or major part: nor ought we to make <HI>number</HI> the <HI>criterion</HI> of the true religion. Men are &s;ickle and various and contradictory in their opinions and practices: but truth and moral rectitude are things fixed, &s;table and uniform, having their foundation in the nature of things. They will not change their nature out of

complai&s;ance to the mo&s;t numerous and powerful body of men in the world. We may <HI>conform</HI> to them; but they will not <HI>conde&s;cend</HI> to us. Were number the mark of truth and right, religion it&s;elf would be a perfect <HI>Proteus,</HI> &s;ometimes one thing, and &s;ometimes another, according to the opinion that happens to prevail in the world. But if one man may err, why not two? And if two, why not two thou&s;and? And then, why not all mankind? If truth and right are &s;omewhat fixed, and men &s;ickle and various, men may err both with re&s;pect to principle and practice. But upon the other hand, if truth and right have no exi&s;tence but in the opinions of men, then indeed they might depend upon number and mul|titude. But then it may be rea&s;onably a&s;ked how many votes are nece&s;&s;ary to change a great lie into a glo|rious truth? how many, to change a flagrant crime into a meritorious virtue? and a &s;inner, into a &s;aint?

but break through all the ties of honour, friend&s;hip, humanity, charity and piety, making intire &s;hipwreck of a good con&s;cience. Afterwards they ima|gine that number is the principal criterion of truth; and flatter them&s;elves that they are always &s;ecure of being in the right, while they adhere to that &s;ide that can carry the vote.

THIS is evidently implied in my text&mdash;<HI>How is it that ye do not di&s;cern this time? Yea, and why even of your &s;elves judge ye not what is right?</HI></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledged that the <HI>Pyrrhoni&s;ts,</HI> who demand great encomiums for teaching men (not to <HI>know</HI> any thing, but) to <HI>doubt</HI> of every thing, have not ge|nerally carried their <HI>Sceptici&s;m</HI> any farther than to deny all certainty in a <HI>relative</HI> &s;en&s;e, or with <HI>re&s;pect to us.</HI> To the mo&s;t of them it appears too gro&s;s to affirm that there is no difference in things them&s;elves; and &s;o no &s;uch thing as truth and right ab&s;olutely, in oppo&s;ition to error and wrong conduct. What they principally in|&s;i&s;t upon is, that all things are totally incomprehen&s;ible by us; that there is no <HI>criterion</HI> of truth and right; by which they may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from error and wrong action: So that although there be, in nature, a difference betwixt them, yet <HI>we</HI> have no faculties for di&s;covering it.</P>
<P>Now upon this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, it is evident that the que&s;tions in the text would be altogether imperti|nent&mdash;as impertinent as they would have been upon the former &s;uppo&s;ition, That there is no real difference in things; but all propo&s;itions, equally true; and all actions, equally right. When it was a&s;ked&mdash;<HI>How is it that ye do not di&s;cern this time? Yea, and why even of your &s;elves judge ye not what is right?</HI> it would have been ea&s;y and natural to an&s;wer&mdash;<Q>Becau&s;e we have no faculties to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt truth and error, right and wrong. The&s;e things are left &s;o uncertain and precarious with re&s;pect to us, that after all our re|&s;earches, we are as di&s;tant from them as ever. It is not po&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t critical inquirer to find the truth in any in&s;tance, this being like a bird that con&s;tantly flies from us with a &s;peed proportioned to that with which we pur&s;ue it. All we can do, is fir&s;t to fatigue our &s;elves in que&s;t of truth, and then

to delude our &s;elves by fancying we have found her.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH is the dark and unhappy condition in which the <HI>&s;ceptical</HI> doctrine &s;uppo&s;es mankind! doomed to total ignorance, and wandering from the right path: Or if, in any ca&s;e, they think and act right, it is by mere <HI>chance;</HI> nor can they have the plea&s;ure of knowing it, if they happen to be in the right. But it is to be hoped that the Author of our being has not been &s;o &s;paring of his favours to us, as to leave us at &s;uch uncertainties about every thing, e&s;pecially about what concerns our own welfare. However, were this really our ca&s;e, one would think that tho&s;e who are &s;en&s;ible it is &s;o, in&s;tead of deriding the doctrine of a &s;upernatural revelation, (as is the practice of modern <HI>Scepticks</HI>) &s;hould accommodate the words of <HI>David</HI> to their own ca&s;e and circum&s;tances&mdash;<HI>Who will &s;hew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us!</HI> The blinder we are naturally, the more need we have of &s;upernatural light and in&s;truction.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of our total <HI>incapacity</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h be|twixt truth and fal&s;hood, right and wrong, has much the &s;ame a&s;pect upon common life, civil &s;ociety, philo&s;ophy and religion, with that of the ab&s;olute indifference of all things <HI>in their own nature:</HI> And the like ab&s;urdities will follow from it. Thus (for example) it follows that there is no difference at all in men with re&s;pect to wi&s;dom and knowledge. For in order to con&s;titute &s;uch a difference, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be a natural di&s;tinction betwixt truth and fal&s;hood; but al&s;o, that &s;ome, at lea&s;t, &s;hould have faculties for di&s;co|vering it. Knowledge, if there be any &s;uch thing, con|&s;i&s;ts in <HI>&s;eeing</HI> or <HI>perceiving</HI> truth. But if no men have a capacity for this, all men mu&s;t be intirely de&s;titute of knowledge; as de&s;titute of it, as if there were in nature no di&s;tinction betwixt truth and error.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="006365_0028_1028AF6F51116668">
THE doctrine of our inability to <HI>di&s;cover</HI> truth and right, has much the &s;ame a&s;pect upon common life, civil &s;ociety, philo&s;ophy and religion, with that of the ab&s;olute <HI>indifference</HI> of all things in their own nature. It as effectually precludes all inquiries concerning truth and virtue, private and publick good; and every other &s;ubject. For what does it &s;ignify to us, that there is a true and a right in nature, while it is &s;uppo&s;ed, we have no faculties for di&s;covering them. If they lie intirely beyond our reach, we have no more concern with them, than if they had no exi&s;tence at all: and it is folly for any one to bu&s;y him&s;elf about them. Nor can any man con&s;i&s;tently take &s;atisfaction in his own opinions and ac|tions, as though the former were true, and the latter, right; or blame another for error in principle or prac|tice, while he a&s;&s;erts that there is equal evidence for the truth of all opinions, and for the regularity of all ac|tions; i. e. no real evidence for the truth and regularity of any. Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, he that denies his own exi&s;tence, and commits murther, adultery and robbery, has as much to &s;ay in his own vindication, as he that a&s;|&s;erts a circle is not a &s;quare, and &s;aves his country from ruin. And from hence it appears, that tho&s;e who carry their <HI>&s;ceptici&s;m</HI> no farther than to que&s;tion the abilities of men to di&s;cover truth and right in all ca&s;es, are guilty of the &s;ame incon&s;i&s;tency with tho&s;e who explode the whole notion of a real di&s;tinction betwixt truth and right, and their contraries. For why will they attempt to in|ve&s;tigate truth? Or why will they plume them&s;elves upon their &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;covery of this notable truth, That men are unable to di&s;cover truth? Why will they up|braid their antagoni&s;ts with ignorance? Why will they, in any ca&s;e, attempt to vindicate their own conduct, under the notion of its being right? Or why will they cen&s;ure that of others, and re&s;ent things under the no|tion of <HI>injury?</HI> This has ever been their practice; which goes wholly upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that truth and right are not only &s;omewhat real in nature; but al&s;o, that they
<PB N="26" REF="006365_0029_1028AF2CD0926A98">
be <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI> from their contraries, at lea&s;t by the&s;e &s;agacious men them&s;elves. What <HI>Ariadne's clue</HI> can be found to extricate them from this labyrinth of folly and contradiction? If there be no <HI>criterion</HI> of truth, let them not pretend to have found one them&s;elves; and then deride others for &s;uppo&s;ing that truth may be di&s;|covered. There are many dogmati&s;ts about the world, who allow them&s;elves only to be the proper judges of truth and right; which is arrogant enough. But no bigotted dogmati&s;t in half &s;o ab&s;urd and in&s;olent as the <HI>Sceptic.</HI> For he endeavours to make a monopoly of truth, and to engro&s;s the whole of that &s;acred trea&s;ure, to the beggaring of the re&s;t of mankind, even while the fir&s;t (and I might add, the only) article of his creed is, <HI>That truth cannot be di&s;covered by any.</HI> It is hard to &s;ay, whether this conduct has in it more of &s;tupidity or of in&s;olence. But thus much is certain, that a thorough-pac'd <HI>Sceptic</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;illy, conceited and incon&s;i&s;tent bigot in the world.</P>
<P>HE that allows of no certainty in any ca&s;e, cannot even be &s;ure that he imagines there is no &s;uch thing as certainty. Perhaps he may be mi&s;taken in thinking he believes what he &s;ays he believes. To &s;ay he is certain he believes what he thinks he does, is to admit of cer|tainty in general, which is to give up the point in que&s;tion. But &s;uppo&s;ing him certainly to know what his own &s;entiments are, how comes he to know that any one contradicts them; or differs from him in opinion? He need not make him&s;elf unea&s;y at the oppo&s;ition of any &s;uppo&s;ed adver&s;aries: For, upon his own &s;cheme, the&s;e adver&s;aries and their oppo&s;ition, may not be real, but wholly <HI>imaginary.</HI> And if one &s;hould call him hard names, per&s;ecute him for his opinion, and an&s;wer his argu|ments with a brick bat in&s;tead of a &s;yllogi&s;m, this may be <HI>imaginary</HI> al&s;o. At lea&s;t, he has nothing to complain of, upon his own principles; for &s;uch a conduct towards him, may po&s;&s;ibly be as right and rea&s;onable, as it in to

<P>BUT to come more directly to the point&mdash;Some things are in them&s;elves &s;o evidently true, that no <HI>criterion</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our knowing them with <HI>certainty.</HI> Thus, for example, that we exi&s;t, is what we have an immediate and intuitive certainty of. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid concerning the <HI>reality</HI> of all our own <HI>ideas</HI> and <HI>perceptions.</HI> That we experience plea&s;ure and pain; that we conver&s;e with various objects which affect us in a dif|ferent manner; that colour is one thing, and &s;ound another; and that &s;melling is not ta&s;ting; the&s;e things are &s;elf-evident, and no <HI>medium</HI> can make them plainer. But it will perhaps be &s;aid, that all this is only phan&s;y and imagination, there being no archetypes exi&s;ting <HI>without</HI> us, of which the&s;e perceptions are the <HI>images</HI> or <HI>repre&s;entations.</HI> Be it &s;o: &s;till the perceptions and ideas them&s;elves are <HI>real:</HI> this we are <HI>certain</HI> of, whether there be any thing <HI>external,</HI> of which they are the an|titypes, or not. So that certainty may be had in &s;ome re&s;pects at lea&s;t. And this is &s;ufficient to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; for we are not &s;peaking concerning the <HI>extent,</HI> but the <HI>certainty,</HI> of human knowledge.</P>
<P>OF the truth of other things we may be certain in a different manner, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by rea&s;on, deducing them from other truths of which we have an intuitive knowledge. Thus it is that a thou&s;and mathematical truths are de|mon&s;trated; and that with a certainty little or nothing
<PB N="28" REF="006365_0031_1028AF2E5B7EDD38">
inferiour to tho&s;e fir&s;t principles from which they are deduced, the connection in every &s;tep through the whole proce&s;s being &s;o apparent, that to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary would be a plain contradiction, and amount to the de|nying a thing to be what it is acknowledged to be. And in the &s;ame way many moral and religious truths may be demon&s;trated al&s;o&mdash;As the being of a God; his power, wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and providence: and our obligation to obey him.</P>
<P>For the truth of many other things we can, indeed, have no more than <HI>probable</HI> evidence; but which is, in many ca&s;es, almo&s;t as &s;atisfactory to the mind as <HI>intuitive</HI> and <HI>demon&s;trative</HI> certainty. Thus who doubts but that the &s;un will &s;et in a few hours?&mdash;that the &s;ea will ebb and flow to morrow, as u&s;ual?&mdash;that autumn will &s;uc|ceed to &s;ummer; winter, to autumn; and &s;pring, to winter, as in times pa&s;s? But of the&s;e things there is no certainty. For God has power to put a &s;top to the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature; and we cannot be certain that he will not do it the next moment. Thus al&s;o probable evi|dence is all we can have for the truth of facts recorded in ancient hi&s;tory. Men may po&s;&s;ibly deceive us. But who has ever been in &s;uch a doubting humour, as to que&s;tion whether there have been &s;uch men as <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> and <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar;</HI> whether they fought, and triumphed, &amp;c? Indeed we can have no more than probable evidence that food and &s;leep will refre&s;h us for the future, as heretofore. Our whole in&s;titution of life, as it relates to the pre&s;ent world, is grounded upon evidence of this &s;ort, and not upon intuitive or demon|&s;trative certainty. Such evidence is ea&s;y to be had; and is &s;ufficient to the purpo&s;es of life, as daily experi|ence &s;hows us. We may, if we plea&s;e, perplex our&s;elves about the nature of <HI>time, place</HI> and <HI>motion:</HI> But men who are no philo&s;phers, find the way <HI>home</HI> at <HI>one o'clock</HI> without any difficulty. We may puzzle our&s;elves about the <HI>e&s;&s;ences</HI> of things, and the <HI>manner</HI> in which one ope|rates
<PB N="29" REF="006365_0032_1028AF760CD10568">
upon another: But experience teaches the hu&s;band|man how to manure his fields, &s;o as to make them fruit|ful: We all know that drink allays our thir&s;t, and food, our hunger; nor do we ever he&s;itate whether we &s;hall make u&s;e of <HI>them,</HI> or of &s;omething el&s;e, to remove tho&s;e natural unea&s;ine&s;&s;es. But &s;till there is no infallible and nece&s;&s;ary connection betwixt tho&s;e cau&s;es and the effects that are u&s;ually produced by them.</P>
<P>NOR is there more room for <HI>&s;ceptici&s;m</HI> in relation to morals and religion, than in common life; nor indeed &s;o much, with regard to the principal branches of our <HI>duty.</HI> But, however it comes to pa&s;s, men take more pains to doubt in one ca&s;e than in the other. We have &s;tronger evidence for the proof of the chief articles of religion, than we have for mo&s;t other things, of which we are fully &s;atisfied. The being and perfections of God may be known without much difficulty; and the&s;e being known, it is as ea&s;y to know how we ought to conduct our&s;elves towards him in general, as it is for a &s;ervant to know how to plea&s;e a ma&s;ter who&s;e temper and character he is ac|quainted with. And it is at lea&s;t as plain that the Sovereign of the world will make a di&s;tinction betwixt the righteous and the wicked, as that a wi&s;e and good prince will make a di&s;tinction betwixt dutiful &s;ubjects, and rebels.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, in general, that men are able to di&s;|tingui&s;h betwixt truth and fal&s;hood, right and wrong. But I &s;hall now make &s;everal ob&s;ervations upon this pro|po&s;ition, in order farther to explain the real intention of it, to obviate &s;ome objections again&s;t it, and to guard it again&s;t tho&s;e abu&s;es to which it may appear liable.</P>
<P>And</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is not intended in this a&s;&s;ertion, that all men have <HI>equal abilities</HI> for judging what is true and right. The whole creation is diver&s;ified, and men in particular. There is a great variety in their intellectual faculties.
<PB N="30" REF="006365_0033_1028AF3276860DB8">
That which principally di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;ome men from the bea&s;ts of the field, is the different formation of their bodies. Their bodies are <HI>human,</HI> but they are in a man|ner <HI>brute</HI> all be&s;ide. Whether the difference that there is in the natural powers of men, proceeds from the ori|ginal make of their minds, or from &s;ome difference in tho&s;e bodily organs upon which the <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> of the rational faculties may be &s;uppo&s;ed to depend; it is apparent that there is, in fact, &s;uch a difference. And therefore when it is &s;aid that men are able to judge what is true and right, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as is con&s;i&s;tent with this fact. Tho&s;e of the lower cla&s;s can go but a little ways with their inquiries into the natural and moral con&s;titution of the world. But even the&s;e may have the power of judging, in <HI>&s;ome degree.</HI> However, upon &s;up|po&s;ition that &s;ome were wholly ignorant even of their own exi&s;tence, it does not follow that all mu&s;t be &s;o, any more than that all bodies mu&s;t be round, becau&s;e &s;ome are of that particular figure. From the mo&s;t dull and &s;tupid of the human &s;pecies, there is a continual ri&s;e or gradation, there being as great a variety in the intellec|tual powers of men, as in their bodily and active powers. And &s;o it may be true of &s;ome in an higher and more proper &s;en&s;e than of others, that they may <HI>even of them|&s;elves judge what is right.</HI> Many things are obvious, and, in a manner fir&s;t principles to <HI>them,</HI> which to others are my&s;terious and incomprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P N="2">2. As a farther limitation of this a&s;&s;ertion, I would ob&s;erve, that it does not imply, that the <HI>&s;ame per&s;ons</HI> are equally adequate judges of truth and right, in all con|ditions and circum&s;tances. There is a great difference in the powers of different men: But no one differs more from another than he does from him&s;elf, con&s;idered in childhood and mature life, before and after his mind is cultivated by &s;tudy and exerci&s;e. The <HI>man</HI> knows what the <HI>child</HI> was ignorant of. We come into the world ignorant of every thing. But he that, in his natural,
<PB N="31" REF="006365_0034_1028AF78C2F270B8">
rude and uncultivated &s;tate, is unqualified to judge what is true and right, unle&s;s it be in a few obvious ca&s;es, is capable of con&s;iderable improvements by &s;tudy and ex|perience. Our intellectual faculties were given us to improve: they ru&s;t for want of u&s;e; but are brightened by exerci&s;e. Exerci&s;e &s;trengthens and invigorates our mental faculties as well as our bodily. And the more a man habituates him&s;elf to intellectual employments, the greater will be his aptne&s;s and facility in di&s;covering truth, and detecting error. Without &s;ome previous &s;tudy and application, it is as impo&s;&s;ible that men &s;hould be accurate judges of truth and right, as it is that they &s;hould be compleat artificers in any mechanical bu&s;ine&s;s, without &s;pending time to learn the trade. They may <HI>bungle</HI> and <HI>cobble;</HI> but can do nothing that will bear the in&s;pection of a <HI>ma&s;ter-workman.</HI> It is the unhappine&s;s of a great part of mankind that they do not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider this natural weakne&s;s, ineptitude and awkward|ne&s;s of human rea&s;on before cultivation; but &s;it down contented with their imaginary &s;agacity and prompt|ne&s;s of under&s;tanding, without u&s;ing the proper means to qualify them for judging of things that may come under their con&s;ideration. Hence it is that we have &s;o many <HI>quacks</HI> and ignorant pretenders in all arts and &s;ciences&mdash;What need of &s;tudy to come at an acquain|tance with tho&s;e &s;ubjects which we may under&s;tand at any time only by opening our eyes? Who will de&s;cend into the bowels of the earth to dig for gold, while it lies in plenty within his reach upon the &s;urface of the ground? Who will dive for pearls, while he imagines they float upon the waves? Or what need has that field of tillage, who&s;e &s;oil is &s;o fertile, that, like that of <HI>Eden,</HI> it pro|duces &s;pontaneou&s;ly the riche&s;t fruits? When men ima|gine that the depths of &s;cience may be fathomed by a &s;ingle glance of thought, without any previous appli|cation to intellectual exerci&s;es, it can not be expected that they &s;hould be able to determine ju&s;tly upon any points but &s;ome of the mo&s;t familiar and obvious. In
<PB N="32" REF="006365_0035_1028AF3674128930">
this ca&s;e, he that was <HI>born like the wild a&s;&s;es-colt,</HI> mu&s;t needs continue to be &s;o; or, at be&s;t, come to maturity, and grow up into an a&s;s him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE alteration which time and &s;tudy make in the abilities of men for judging concerning truth and right, is &s;ufficient to account for the diver&s;ity of &s;entiments entertained by the <HI>&s;ame per&s;ons</HI> at different periods of their life, without having recour&s;e to <HI>&s;ceptici&s;m,</HI> or &s;up|po&s;ing all our notions, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, to be mere phan&s;y and illu&s;ion. A man may err once without erring always. Nor can we argue from the reveries of youth, and the ab&s;urd conceits of the illiterate, that all mankind are but a mighty nation of fools and luna|ticks, plea&s;ing them&s;elves with idle dreams and delu&s;ive appearances, in&s;tead of realities.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT men are able <HI>even of them&s;elves to judge what is right,</HI> does not imply, that they can receive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from books, and the conver&s;ation of learned men; Or that they may judge as well without the&s;e helps as with them. Although all men are capable of di&s;cerning truth and right in &s;ome degree, by the bare exerci&s;e of their own natural faculties, it does not follow that they can &s;tand in no need of any foreign aid, in order to their judging in a more perfect manner. The more knowing may be helpful to others in their pur&s;uit of knowledge. And the abilities of men for rea&s;oning ju&s;tly, and judging truly, may depend, in a great mea&s;ure, upon the method of their education, the books they read, and the genius and abilities of the per&s;ons they conver&s;e with. Who will pretend that the natives of <HI>Greenland,</HI> or the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> enjoy the &s;ame, or equal, means of knowledge, with tho&s;e that are born in the polite and learned nations of <HI>Europe?</HI> Who ima|gines that one brought up at the plough is as likely to form right notions of things, as if he had been educated at a univer&s;ity? Or that a man who has con|ver&s;ed

only with ordinary Mechanics, has the &s;ame advantages with tho&s;e who have enjoyed the fa|miliarity of the greate&s;t proficients in literature? To &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e things, is to contradict daily experi|ence. And, therefore, to decline all a&s;&s;i&s;tances from others in the &s;earch of knowledge, under a notion, that we are able to <HI>judge even of our&s;elves what is right,</HI> is pride and vanity, and not the part of an ingenuous in|quirer after truth. This may be allowed by the mo&s;t &s;trenuous a&s;&s;erter of mens natural abilities, and natural right, to judge for them&s;elves, without any appearance of incon&s;i&s;tency or contradiction. For it amounts to no more than this, that &s;ome men are &s;uperiour to others, and may help them to the knowledge of &s;ome things which they would not have known without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is not implied in this doctrine, that mens intel|lectual powers have no bounds at all; or that they are equally able to determine upon all points, although they &s;hould improve all the helps to knowledge, and culti|vate their rea&s;on in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible. There are many ca&s;es wherein the wi&s;e&s;t of men are unable to form any judgment at all&mdash;difficulties which they cannot &s;olve&mdash;heights which they cannot climb&mdash;depths which they cannot fathom&mdash;Some may, per|haps, think this a reflection upon human under&s;tanding. And indeed it is &s;o, if it be any reflection upon it to &s;ay, that it is not infinite like that of God; but not otherwi&s;e. To &s;ay that human rea&s;on is confined to a certain &s;phere, beyond which it cannot penetrate, is, in reality, no more than to a&s;&s;ert that man is a finite, and not an infinite, being; a creature, and not the Creator. There are probably created intelligences much &s;uperiour to man even <HI>in his be&s;t e&s;tate:</HI> But it is no derrogation from their real dignity, to &s;ay they are not omni&s;cient. Why then &s;hould man gra&s;p at omni&s;cience? imagine he may know every thing becau&s;e he may know &s;ome?
<PB N="34" REF="006365_0037_1028AF37F8108618">
and look upon it as a reproach, when it is &s;aid that his rea&s;on, and all his other faculties are circum&s;cribed?</P>
<P>WE may know what is proper to be known by beings of our rank, &s;o as to fill our place, and an&s;wer the de&s;ign of our creation, without being able to comprehend all things. We may know that <HI>this earth</HI> is inhabited by creatures, the law of who&s;e nature is virtue, and its end happine&s;s; although we cannot certainly tell whether the <HI>planets</HI> are inhabited, or not; or, if they are, by what kind of beings, and what their condition and cir|cum&s;tances. We may know, in general, what tends to health and felicity in this world, although the real e&s;&s;en|ces of things &s;hould be beyond our reach. We may know that whatever <HI>came into exi&s;tence,</HI> (as it is demon|&s;trable that every thing did which we behold) mu&s;t have &s;ome <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> cau&s;e adequate to it, although we were not able to form a clear idea of creative power, or the manner of its exertion. We may know that beauty, order, harmony and de&s;ign, in the works of nature, pre|&s;uppo&s;e a <HI>de&s;igner,</HI> or, intelligent artificer; although we cannot comprehend the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e. We may know that a con&s;titution of things, actually tend|ing to happine&s;s, mu&s;t be the product of goodne&s;s, al|though we are not able exactly to define, beforehand, that &s;y&s;tem the corre&s;pondent parts of which &s;hall be &s;o adju&s;ted as to effect the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good. We may know in general that the Author of the world mu&s;t be a wi&s;e and good being, although the final cau&s;es of &s;ome things which we &s;ee in it, are beyond our &s;ight. In fine, we may know that <HI>God is, and that he is a rewar|der of them that diligently &s;eek him;</HI> although we cannot <HI>by &s;earching find out the almighty unto perfection;</HI> or comprehend his nature; or &s;ee through the whole &s;cheme of his works, government and providence.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;e&s;t of men was not a&s;hamed to own this imperfection of human rea&s;on, even under its greate&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="006365_0038_1028AF7E77EEA250">
improvements, and carried to its mo&s;t exalted pitch. <HI>When I applied mine heart to know wi&s;dom,</HI> &s;ays Solo|mon, <HI>then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out all the work that is done under the &s;un; becau&s;e though a man &s;eek it out, yet &s;hall he not find it; yea farther, though a wi&s;e man think to know it, yet &s;hall he not be able to find it.</HI> However <HI>Solomon</HI> was no <HI>Sceptic.</HI> In the &s;ame book we find him &s;aying, <HI>that wi&s;dom excel|leth folly, as much as light excelleth darkne&s;s:</HI> And with him the conclu&s;ion of the whole matter is,&mdash;<HI>Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole of man.</HI> Whatever he might be in doubt about, he was &s;atisfied of this, That there was a God who governed the world, that his will and commandments might be known, and that the bu&s;ine&s;s and happine&s;s of man, con|&s;i&s;ts in obeying them.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="5">5. WHEN it is &s;aid we are able <HI>even of our&s;elves to judge what is right,</HI> this is not de&s;igned to &s;ugge&s;t that our in|tellectual faculties are &s;o capacious as to render a <HI>&s;u|pernatural revelation</HI> of no u&s;e or importance to us. Certainly we cannot &s;uppo&s;e this to be the intention of him that uttered the words of our text, &s;ince one of the titles which he took upon him&s;elf, was that of a <HI>Prophet,</HI> or a <HI>Teacher &s;ent from God.</HI> And indeed it nece&s;&s;arily follows from the &s;uppo&s;ition of our rational faculties be|ing <HI>limited,</HI> that there is <HI>room</HI> for our being in&s;tructed by revelation. If one man may in&s;truct another, much more may we &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for <HI>him that is perfect in knowledge</HI> to &s;upply the natural defects of human rea&s;on by a &s;upernatural communication of light and knowledge. When, and how far, it is expedient for him to do this, He only knows. However upon &s;up|po&s;ition of &s;uch a revelation, we mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be able to &s;ee the evidence of its being &s;uch. It is the proper office of rea&s;on to determine whether what is propo&s;ed to us under the notion of a revelation from God, be attended with &s;uitable atte&s;tations and cre|dentials,
<PB N="36" REF="006365_0039_1028AF3C6D3DB9E0">
or not. So that even in this ca&s;e, we may <HI>of our&s;elves judge what is right.</HI> If there be no rational evidence of its coming from God, no rational man can receive it as &s;uch: And, on the other hand, if it be ac|companied with rational evidence, no rea&s;onable man can reject it. Indeed what Je&s;us Chri&s;t, particularly blames the <HI>Jews</HI> for in the text, is their not exerci&s;ing their rea&s;on in this way. He had &s;ufficiently proved his divine mi&s;&s;ion; but they would not <HI>di&s;cern the time,</HI> nor <HI>judge what was right,</HI> being under the influence of prejudice, and not of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, it is the proper office of rea&s;on to de|termine the meaning of the particular parts of a re|velation, after the divine authority of it in general is e&s;tabli&s;hed and allowed. And this mens natural fa|culties qualify them for, much in the &s;ame manner that they qualify them for interpreting other writings. If God gives men a revelation, he gives it to be under|&s;tood by men: And if he gives it to be under&s;tood by men, he mu&s;t give it in human language, and accommodate it to human capacity. For otherwi&s;e, a &s;econd revelation would be nece&s;&s;ary to explain the fir&s;t: And then, why not a third to explain the &s;econd; and &s;o on <HI>in infinitum?</HI> And &s;o nothing would be really <HI>revealed</HI> after all.</P>
<P>I &s;hall ju&s;t add in the</P>
<P>6th, and la&s;t place, as a farther limitation of the propo&s;ition before us, That it does not intend that we are able to determine, with an equal degree of certainty, all points which we are capable, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, of com|ing to a conclu&s;ion about. Although truth does not ad|mit of <HI>degrees,</HI> yet the evidence of truth does. So that of various propo&s;itions equally true in them&s;elves, &s;ome may be known with greater certainty than others. Probable evidence is indeed all that can be had in mo&s;t ca&s;es, as was ob&s;erved before. It is by virtue of this,
<PB N="37" REF="006365_0040_102885F26EEA3D18">
that the intercour&s;e of man with man, and all the bu&s;ine&s;s and commerce of the world, is carried on. Experience &s;hows that &s;uch evidence is &s;ufficient in <HI>&s;ecular</HI> affairs: And it may be &s;ufficient in <HI>religious</HI> affairs al&s;o, in tho&s;e ca&s;es where ab&s;olute certainty cannot be had.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude this head concerning the cer|tainty and &s;ufficiency of human knowledge, with the words of Mr. <HI>Locke.</HI> <Q>If&mdash;any one, &s;ays he, will be &s;o &s;ceptical as to di&s;tru&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and to affirm that all we &s;ee and hear, feel and ta&s;te, think and do, dur|ing our whole being, is but the &s;eries and deluding appearances of a long dream, whereof there is no rea|lity; and therefore will que&s;tion the exi&s;tence of all things, or our knowledge of any thing: I mu&s;t de&s;ire him to con&s;ider, that if all be a dream, then he doth but dream that he makes the que&s;tion; and &s;o it is not much matter, that a waking man &s;hould an&s;wer him. But yet, if he plea&s;es, he may dream that I make him this an&s;wer, that the certainty of things ex|i&s;ting <HI>in rerum natura,</HI> when we have the te&s;timony of our &s;en&s;es for it, is not only as great as our frame can attain to, but as our condition needs. For our facul|ties being &s;uited not to the full extent of being, nor to a perfect, clear and comprehen&s;ive knowledge of things, free from all doubt and &s;cruple; but to the pre&s;er|vation of us in whom they are; and accommodated to the u&s;e of life; they &s;erve our purpo&s;e well enough, if they will but give us certain notice of tho&s;e things which are convenient, or inconvenient to us. For he that &s;ees a candle burning, and hath experimented the force of its flame, by putting his finger in it, will little doubt that this is &s;omething exi&s;ting,&mdash;which does him harm, and puts him to great pain: which is a&s;&s;urance enough, when no man requires greater certainty to govern his actions by, than what is as certain as his actions them&s;elves. And if our dreamer plea&s;es to try, whether the glowing heat of a gla&s;s
<PB N="38" REF="006365_0041_102A22FB6AF2A4E8">
furnace, be barely a wandring imagination, in a drow&s;y man's fancy; by putting his hand into it, he may per|haps be wakened into a certainty, that it is &s;omething more than bare imagination. So that this evidence is as great as we can de&s;ire, being as certain to us as our plea&s;ure or pain, i. e. happine&s;s or mi&s;ery; be|yond which we have no concernment, either of know|ing or being.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Locke's</HI> works, edit. 4th Vol. 1. <HI>p.</HI> 312.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THUS it appears that men are naturally endowed with faculties proper for di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt truth and error, right and wrong. And hence it follows, that the doctrine of a total ignorance, and incapacity to judge of moral and religious truths, brought upon mankind by the apo&s;tacy of our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents,</HI> is without foundation. How much brighter and more vigorous our intellectual faculties were in <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;ix thou&s;and years before we had any exi&s;tence, I leave others to determine. It is &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e to con&s;ider mankind as they are at pre|&s;ent, without inquiring what they were before they had any being. And it appears that they have now a natural power to judge what is true and right, with the re&s;tric|tions mentioned above. But it is, neverthele&s;s, the man|ner of vain <HI>Enthu&s;iasts,</HI> when the ab&s;urdity of their doctrines is laid open, to fall a railing, telling their oppo|&s;ers that they are in a <HI>carnal &s;tate, blind,</HI> and unable to judge: but that them&s;elves are <HI>&s;piritually illuminated.</HI> Thus they endeavour to palm the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities upon their neighbours, under the notion of their being divine truths and holy my&s;teries: So that the&s;e en|lightened Ideots make in&s;piration, and the Spirit of truth and wi&s;dom, the vehicle of non&s;en&s;e and contradictions. Whatever is rea&s;onable, is, with them, carnal: and nothing is worthy of belief, but what is impo&s;&s;ible and ab&s;urd in the eye of human rea&s;on.</P>

WE &s;ee that our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour did not &s;uppo&s;e that the minds of men had &s;uffered any &s;uch total eclip&s;e, or were wholly over&s;pread with darkne&s;s.

<P>LET us retain a &s;uitable &s;en&s;e of the dignity of our nature in this re&s;pect. It is by our rea&s;on that we are exalted above the bea&s;ts of the field. It is by this, that we are allied to angels, and all the glorious intelli|gences of the heavenly world: Yea, by this we re&s;em|ble God him&s;elf. It is principally on account of our rea&s;on, that we are &s;aid to have been <HI>created in the image of God.</HI> So that how weak &s;oever our intellectual faculties are, yet to &s;peak reproachfully of rea&s;on in ge|neral, is nothing le&s;s than bla&s;phemy again&s;t God. Let us, therefore, in&s;tead of contemning this ine&s;timable gift, in which con&s;i&s;ts the glory of our nature, employ it to the ends for which it was de&s;igned, in the &s;ervice of the great Father of our &s;pirits.</P>
<P>BUT we have had occa&s;ion, in this di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;peak of the imperfection, as well as of the &s;trength, of human rea&s;on.

This will naturally lead us to humility; and excite us to improve, with gratitude and diligence, all the means of knowledge which we are favoured with; e&s;pecially that revelation which God has given us by his Son, whom he has &s;ent from heaven to be <HI>a light unto the Gentiles,</HI> as well as <HI>the glory of his people I&s;rael.</HI> A Sen&s;e of our ignorance would al&s;o teach us mode&s;ty in critici&s;ing the works of nature and providence. The &s;cheme of God's govern|ment is va&s;t; our under&s;tandings are narrow, and not proportion'd to it. We are at pre&s;ent, as it were, but rational beings in <HI>embrio,</HI> unborn to light and knowledge. At lea&s;t we are mere <HI>babes</HI> in &s;peculation; we <HI>&s;peak as children;</HI> we <HI>think as children;</HI> we <HI>under&s;tand as chil|dren:</HI> But perhaps we may e'erlong <HI>become men, and put away childi&s;h things.</HI> 'Till we arrive at that maturity of life and knowledge, towards which we are in progre&s;s during our abode in the pre&s;ent world, we ought not to think &s;trange that our under&s;tandings are baffled; or that many things remain my&s;terious and unaccount|able to us, both in the natural and moral government of God. And in&s;tead of boldly cen&s;uring the author of the univer&s;e, as taking wrong mea&s;ures in any re&s;pect, it becomes us to u&s;e that humble language, not only of a great man, but an in&s;pired <HI>apostle&mdash;O! the depths of the riches both of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of God!

<P>HAVING attempted to &s;how, in two former di&s;|cour&s;es up on the&s;e words, That there is a natural difference betwixt truth and fal&s;hood, right and wrong: And, That men are naturally endowed with fa|culties proper for the di&s;cerning of the&s;e differences: I proceed now to &s;how in the</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="006365_0045_1028AF44C91977C0">
IIId. <HI>And last place,</HI> That men are under obligation to exert the&s;e faculties; and to judge for them&s;elves in things of a religious concern. It cannot be doubted but that this is fairly implied in my text. For the words evidently carry in them a &s;evere cen&s;ure and reproof of the per&s;ons to whom they were originally addre&s;&s;ed, on account of their neglecting to judge for them&s;elves concerning our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and his doctrine. He makes this neglect, an argument of their hypocri&s;y, one of the ba&s;e&s;t vices&mdash;<HI>Ye hypocrites, ye can di&s;cern the face of the &s;ky&mdash;and why, even of your&s;elves judge ye not what is right?</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ubject before us being the duty of private judg|ment, I &s;hall briefly explain what I intend by per&s;ons judging for them&s;elves; or by freedom of thought and inquiry in religious matters: And then &s;how, that this is what we are all obliged to.</P>
<P>Now what I intend by a man's judging for him&s;elf with freedom, and exerting his own faculties in the &s;earch of truth and right, may be compri&s;ed under the following particulars&mdash;</P>
<P>THAT he &s;u&s;pends his judgment intirely concerning the truth or fal&s;hood of all doctrines; and the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s of all actions; 'till &s;uch time as he &s;ees &s;ome rea&s;on to determine his judgment one way rather than the other. He that de&s;ires to come to the knowledge of the truth, puts him&s;elf in a &s;tate of <HI>indifferency</HI> with regard to the point to be judged of; that &s;o his mind being as it were, in <HI>aequilibrio,</HI> his judgment may be de|termined &s;olely by rea&s;on and argument. He does not bring his old prejudices and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to determine the point; but comes prepared, by an unbia&s;&s;ed mind, to receive the impre&s;&s;ions of rea&s;on, and of rea&s;on only. All propo&s;itions are the proper &s;ubject of inquiry and examination, except <HI>first principles,</HI> which are few in
<PB N="43" REF="006365_0046_1028AF869BE576D8">
number, and which do not extend to any doctrines either of <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>revealed</HI> religion, how nearly &s;oever they may be connected with &s;ome of <HI>both.</HI> And therefore, in order to our judging with true freedom, we ought to con&s;ider all &s;uch doctrines with an eye of indifferency, neither fancying them to be true or fal&s;e; nor even <HI>wi&s;hing</HI> them to be &s;o, till we &s;ee they are connected with, or contrary to, &s;ome of tho&s;e fir&s;t principles of human knowledge, which being &s;elf evident, are not the &s;ubject of examination. Thus, for example, we ought not to believe that there is, or that there is not a God; that the Chri&s;tian religion is from God, or an impo&s;ture; that any particular doctrine fathered upon it, is really contained in it, or not; or that any particular &s;ect of chri&s;tians, is in the right, or in the wrong; 'till we have impartially examined the matter, and &s;ee evidence on one &s;ide or the other. For to determine any point without rea&s;on or proof, cannot be to judge <HI>freely,</HI> unle&s;s it be in a bad &s;en&s;e of the word. So that &s;u&s;pen&s;e or indif|ferency, is the fir&s;t thing implied in free inquiry: or, to &s;peak more properly, it is a pre-requi&s;ite, and prepara|tory to it.</P>
<P>AGAIN: The next &s;tep towards freedom of exami|nation and judgment, is the exerting of our own rea&s;on in weighing arguments and evidences that offer them|&s;elves to us, or that are offered by others. He that in|quires freely after truth, is not content with barely &s;u&s;|pending his judgment till &s;uch time as evidence forces it &s;elf upon his mind. In this way, a man may perhaps avoid error; but will not gain much knowledge; for truth is coy, and mu&s;t be courted. To gain any con&s;ide|rable degree of knowledge, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we are active and vigorous in the pur&s;uit of it; that we make u&s;e of all the means and helps to knowledge that are within our reach; that we inquire into facts; that we view things in different lights, not taking up &s;atisfied with fir&s;t appearances; that we weigh the arguments
<PB N="44" REF="006365_0047_1028AF465281DE88">
that are brought to &s;upport any doctrine or practice; that we balance them with contrary arguments; and the like.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing implied in the freedom of judgment is, that a man hone&s;tly <HI>embraces</HI> for truth, whatever there appears evidence for, without endeavouring to evade it, to &s;hift it off, or &s;tifle the conviction of his own mind. To inquire into evidence, is to no purpo&s;e, unle&s;s we fol|low it wherever it leads, and chearfully receive the truth wherever it is to be found; whatever notions it may contradict; whatever cen&s;ures it may expo&s;e us to. It is an idle and incon&s;i&s;tent thing to examine, if we are determined before hand to retain our former &s;entiments; to believe as our fore-fathers did, or as any particular body of men does at pre&s;ent. A man does not really inquire after truth and right at all, unle&s;s he determines from the very fir&s;t, to have no &s;uper&s;titious veneration for <HI>great names;</HI> but to yield him&s;elf up to evidence wherever it appears; and how much &s;oever it might have contributed to his pre&s;ent intere&s;t and reputation to have embraced other tenets.</P>
<P>LASTLY: Judging with freedom and impartiality, implies, that in giving our a&s;&s;ent to any propo&s;ition, we give it in proportion to the degree of evidence that ap|pears to &s;upport it. All truths are not equally clear and inconte&s;tible: Innumerable lie quite beyond our &s;ight; &s;ome ju&s;t down upon our minds; others appear in a &s;trong and convincing light, tho' not &s;o &s;trong as to exclude all doubt; while others glare upon us with all the force of demon&s;tration. Now as there are innumerable degrees of evidence betwixt the lowe&s;t probability, and that in|tuitive certainty which we have of fir&s;t principles; &s;o a man ought not to give the &s;ame degree of a&s;&s;ent to every thing he receives for truth; but to proportion his a&s;&s;ent to the nature and degree of the apparent evidence, whe|ther it be greater or le&s;s. Not to a&s;&s;ent to what is, in
<PB N="45" REF="006365_0048_1028AF898403AA08">
the lowe&s;t degree, probable upon the whole, di&s;covers a backwardne&s;s to entertain the truth. And, on the other hand, to give an a&s;&s;ent to any truth, over and beyond what the nature of its evidence naturally demands and calls forth, is much the &s;ame thing with believing without any evidence at all. For all that redundancy of a&s;&s;ent, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, is mere credulity and ra&s;hne&s;s: and this is as unbecoming a rea&s;onable creature as ob|&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>HAVING thus briefly explained what I intend by judg|ing for our&s;elves, with freedom, I proceed now to &s;how, That this is what every man is under obligation to do. This I propo&s;e to prove <HI>directly</HI> by rea&s;on and revela|tion; and then to an&s;wer the principal <HI>objections</HI> that are urged again&s;t it.</P>
<P>EACH individual has an intere&s;t of <HI>his own</HI> depending. We find, by experience, that we are all capable of being happy or mi&s;erable to a great degree. Pain and plea|&s;ure, at lea&s;t, are private and per&s;onal things. And even they that arrogate to them&s;elves the right of <HI>judging for us,</HI> do not pretend to <HI>feel for us</HI> al&s;o. Now if it be of any importance to us to be happy for our&s;elves, it is of importance to judge for our&s;elves al&s;o; for this is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to our finding the path that leads to happine&s;s. Indeed if others can afford us any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in finding this path, it is rea&s;onable to make u&s;e of it; but not to give our&s;elves up intirely to their di|rection. It is the greate&s;t folly imaginable, to give our|&s;elves no concern about our own welfare, unle&s;s we were certain it is &s;ecured to us already, &s;o that we cannot po&s;|&s;ibly mi&s;s of it, which is a &s;uppo&s;ition contrary to daily experience. We find that our happine&s;s depends, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, upon our conduct; and that we often take &s;ome wrong &s;tep, through ignorance; which ought to be a warning to us to look about us, and take heed to our ways.&mdash;Without knowing which is the
<PB N="46" REF="006365_0049_1028AFCF8D1482C0">
right path, we can never take it, unle&s;s it be by <HI>chance;</HI> and though we &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to get into it, we cannot have the &s;atisfaction of knowing it.</P>
<P>IN our pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate, &s;uch inquiries as the following, become every man that has not yet re&s;olved them in his own mind&mdash;<Q>What is my chief good? Where is the road that will convey me to my happi|ne&s;s? Where &s;hall I find this ine&s;timable jewel? this <HI>pearl of great price?</HI> In what mountain &s;hall I dig for it? In what ocean &s;hall I dive? Amid&s;t the various opinions, and contrary pur&s;uits of mankind, what road &s;hall I my&s;elf travel? What cour&s;e &s;hall I &s;teer? Shall I find my felicity in retirement and &s;olitude? Or in the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle of the world? Is it to be found in the humble and quiet cottage? Or in proud and envious courts? Is it to be found in peace at home? Or in war abroad? Does it con&s;i&s;t in indulg|ing to my animal nature without controul? Or in im|proving my mind in what &s;ome men call <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>virtue?</HI> Shall I &s;eek it in my own country? Or ex|plore &s;ome di&s;tant region in hopes to find it? Shall I &s;earch it upon the &s;eas, or upon the dry land? In the earth beneath, or in the heavens above? In this world, or in <HI>&s;ome other?</HI> Is my &s;pirit immortal? Am I to &s;urvive the di&s;&s;olution of my body, and to live forever in &s;ome other &s;tate? Or &s;hall this vital &s;park that thinks, perceives and wills, and is anxious about futu|rity, be wholly extingui&s;hed in a few days, when my body falls to du&s;t? Is there any being who created, and who governs the world? Or is this beautiful and &s;tupendous fabrick of the univer&s;e, the offspring of chance? And without any <HI>guide, over&s;eer</HI> or <HI>ruler?</HI>&mdash;a fatherle&s;s World, which the next moment may fall into ruins, or into nothing? If there be a God, what is his character? Is he powerful, wife, righteous and good; or is he not? Does my happine&s;s depend upon plea&s;ing and obeying him, and conforming my|&s;elf to his will? If it does, what is his will? What are
<PB N="47" REF="006365_0050_1028AF8D6C6BDF38">
his laws? What does he expect of me? What kind of government is it I am under? What is the particular and certain way, in which I may obtain the good-will of this great Parent of the world, <HI>in who&s;e favour is life, and who&s;e loving-kindne&s;s is better than life?</HI></Q></P>
<P>THESE, methinks, are &s;uch inquiries as every man &s;hould endeavour to get &s;ome &s;atisfaction about in his own <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">nd&mdash;&s;atisfaction of quite another kind than any that can be had barely from the deci&s;ions of others con|cerning them. The que&s;tions are too intere&s;ting and im|portant to be &s;ubmitted to the determination of a &s;econd per&s;on.</P>
<P>BUT were we di&s;po&s;ed to leave matters of this con|&s;equence to reference, who &s;hall be the judges? There are almo&s;t as many opinions in the world, as there are men. The <HI>Talapoins</HI> of <HI>Siam</HI> have one &s;y&s;tem of religi|on: the <HI>Mufti</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> another: and Chri&s;tians, a third; and &s;o on. And almo&s;t all alledge divine revela|tion in their own favour. There are even &s;ome <HI>fools</HI> who <HI>&s;ay in their heart, there is no God;</HI> and not only in their <HI>heart,</HI> but repeat it with their <HI>lips</HI> al&s;o. Now &s;hall we &s;ubmit to the <HI>Thei&s;ts,</HI> or to the <HI>Athei&s;ts?</HI> How &s;hall we know on which &s;ide the truth lies, without examination? But &s;uppo&s;e we embrace <HI>Thei&s;m,</HI> what &s;ect of the <HI>Thei&s;ts</HI> &s;hall we fall in with? With tho&s;e who deny, or tho&s;e who maintain, a revelation from God? Is it rea&s;onable to give in to either party, before we inquire which has the be&s;t of the Argument? But &s;uppo&s;e we fall in with the <HI>latter,</HI> there are &s;everal &s;ects of them, the principal of which are <HI>Jews, Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> It cannot be a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> part to fall in with one, in oppo&s;ition to the other two, <HI>without rea&s;on.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;e we are con|vinced that the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion is true, do not <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> differ very widely in their &s;entiments? Do they not dif|fer &s;o much in explaining the doctrines of their common revelation, as to agree in hardly any thing be&s;ides the name

of <HI>Chri&s;tian?</HI> Are they not divided into many &s;ects, the mo&s;t of which &s;trenuou&s;ly maintain, that not only truth, but &s;alvation al&s;o, is confined to them&s;elves? Do they not deal out their cur&s;es mutually with a liberal hand?

<P>Now amid&s;t the&s;e differences and altercations, what is the part of a rea&s;onable man, but to &s;it down, and ex|erci&s;e, as well as he can, his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> intellectual powers; and &s;o to <HI>judge even of him&s;elf what is right?</HI> What &s;y&s;tem of doctrine&mdash;what mode of wor&s;hip&mdash;what form of church-government and di&s;cipline, is mo&s;t agreable to &s;cripture and rea&s;on&mdash;what &s;ect of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> he &s;hall unite with&mdash;and whether with any one, in all its minute and di&s;tingui&s;hing tenets and u&s;ages&mdash;? <Q>A man mu&s;t join him&s;elf to the <HI>true, primitive</HI> and <HI>catholic</HI> church.</Q> What church is that? all churches lay claim to that title: and the que&s;tion to be decided is, which of them &s;upports its claim the be&s;t? which cannot be decided with|out previous inquiry. <Q>But there is a <HI>living infallible guide</HI> upon earth, to whom it is ea&s;y to repair; and then we may be &s;ure of being in the right without any farther trouble.</Q> Where is he? Many deny there is any &s;uch unerring guide, and infallible umpire, as confidently as others affirm it. But even tho&s;e who agree that there is &s;uch a &s;overeign judge of religious controver&s;y, are not yet fully agreed who he is; or whe|ther infallibility be to be found in one &s;ingle per&s;on or more. The heads of all &s;ects u&s;ually decide di&s;putable matters with full as much a&s;&s;urance and lordline&s;s as it would become infallibility it&s;elf to do it, although they do not all, in &s;o many words, pretend to be exempted from a po&s;&s;ibility of erring. Tho&s;e who claim infalli|bility, often decide and order as if they were fallible: And tho&s;e who do not claim it, are often full as po&s;itive, and given to dominineering as much, as if it unque&s;ti|onably belonged to them.</P>

<P>BUT his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> thinks this a bold in|fringement of his prerogative, and univer&s;al juri&s;dic|tion in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters. Who&s;e word, then, is to be taken?

<P>THUS it appears that a regard to our own intere&s;t ought to put us upon examining and judging for our|&s;elves in religious concerns. The &s;ame thing might be argued from the faculty of rea&s;on it&s;elf, which is com|mon to all. If we &s;uppo&s;e an intelligent author of our nature, who had &s;ome <HI>de&s;ign</HI> in giving us our pre&s;ent con&s;titution, it is plain that his end in endowing us with faculties proper for the inve&s;tigating of truth and right, was, that we &s;hould exerci&s;e them in this way. Each of our bodily organs, and animal faculties, has an apparent <HI>final cau&s;e.</HI> Our eyes are for &s;eeing; our ears, for hear|ing; our hands, for handling; our feet, for walking|ing;
<PB N="50" REF="006365_0053_1028AFD5040995A8">
&amp;c. Nor is it le&s;s apparent that our under&s;tandings were given us to be employed in the &s;earch of truth, and in embracing it. Truth is the natural object of rea&s;on, as much as any thing el&s;e is the proper object of that particular faculty or pa&s;&s;ion, to which God and nature have adapted it. Our obligation, therefore, to inquire after truth, and to judge what is right, may be found within us, in our own frame and con&s;titution. This ob|ligation is as univer&s;al as rea&s;on it&s;elf; for every one that is endowed with this faculty, is, by the very nature of it, obliged to exerci&s;e it in the pur&s;uit of knowledge; e&s;pecially of moral and religious knowledge. All men are not obliged to &s;tudy the <HI>mathematicks, law</HI> and <HI>phy&s;ick.</HI> But all are obliged to acquaint them&s;elves with their <HI>duty</HI>&mdash;what they owe to God, to their neighbour and them&s;elves. If one man is to think and judge for all the re&s;t of the &s;pecies, why was rea&s;on given to all? why was it not confined to him alone who has a right to u&s;e it? In &s;hort, we may &s;ay with as much propriety, that we are to &s;ee only with another's eyes, hear with another's ears, &s;peak with another's tongue, and walk with another's feet, and neglect our own; as, that we are to think and judge and believe, with another's un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IT appears, then, that rea&s;on is no enemy to free in|quiry, and private judgment, in religious matters. And I &s;hall now endeavour to &s;how that the <HI>Chri&s;tian religion</HI> is no enemy to it; but, on the contrary, enjoins it upon us as a duty.</P>
<P>OUR Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>the author and fini&s;her of our faith,</HI> con&s;tantly appealed to the &s;en&s;es, and to the rea&s;on of mankind, as the proper judges of his miracles, divine mi&s;&s;ion and doctrine. He did not demand of men an implicit and blind belief in him&s;elf, without offering matter of conviction to their under&s;tandings; but put them upon examining in a &s;ober rational way, whether
<PB N="51" REF="006365_0054_1028AF91E90995B0">
he was authorized from heaven, or were an impo&s;tor; and &s;o, whether his doctrine were <HI>of God, or whether he &s;pake of him&s;elf.</HI> He rea&s;ons with the <HI>Jews</HI> in my text: he blames them for their blind attachment to the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> their <HI>&s;piritual guides;</HI> and for not judging for them&s;elves in religious matters. Our Lord, pretended (at lea&s;t) to prove his divine mi&s;&s;ion to the unprejudiced rea&s;on of mankind in a &s;ober, argumenta|tive way. In di&s;puting with the <HI>Jews,</HI> he appealed to their ancient writings who&s;e divine authority they ac|knowledged; and to the miracles which he wrought, in order to convince them that he was the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> This is evident from almo&s;t every page of the evangelical hi&s;|tory, notwith&s;tanding what the di&s;ingenuous author of <HI>Chri&s;tianity not founded upon argument,</HI> has confidently a&s;|&s;erted upon this &s;ubject, taking advantage of what &s;ome weak Chri&s;tians have advanced concerning the nature and grounds of <HI>faith.</HI> Whether the arguments which our Lord u&s;ed for the conviction of the <HI>Jews,</HI> were con|clu&s;ive or not, is a que&s;tion which I am not now con|cerned with. But it is plain that he con&s;idered them as being &s;o, requiring people to examine them, and to judge whether they were conclu&s;ive or not. Barely pro|po&s;ing arguments to the con&s;ideration of another, is a di&s;claiming of <HI>authority</HI> properly &s;o called: for it im|plies, that the arguments are to be judged of by the rea&s;on of him to whom they are propo&s;ed. I might bring many pa&s;&s;ages from the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> to &s;how that the method which our Lord took to gain pro&s;elytes, was to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> them into faith. But I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with quoting one pa&s;&s;age only to this purpo&s;e, for the pre&s;ent&mdash;<HI>John</HI> V. 31. and onward, <HI>If I bear witne&s;s of my&s;elf, my witne&s;s is not true</HI> [i. e. my te&s;timony in my own favour&mdash;my declaring my&s;elf to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> ought not to be depended upon as true, without farther evidence.] <HI>There is another that beareth witne&s;s of me&mdash;Ye &s;ent unto John, and he bare witne&s;s unto the truth&mdash;But I have greater witne&s;s than that of John; for the
<PB N="52" REF="006365_0055_1028AFD7B8A59258">
works that the Father hath given me to fini&s;h, the &s;ame works that I do, bear witne&s;s of me, that the Father hath &s;ent me&mdash;Search the &s;criptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which te&s;tify of me&mdash;There is one that accu&s;eth you, even Mo&s;es, in whom ye tru&s;t.

And this al&s;o &s;hows that our Lord aimed at bringing men to believe in him, only by dint of argu|ment. And as our Lord performed his mighty works with a de&s;ign to beget in tho&s;e that beheld them, a rati|onal belief, a belief re&s;ulting from proper evidence; &s;o the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> committed tho&s;e facts to writing, that they might have a like effect upon tho&s;e that had not been eye-witne&s;&s;es of them&mdash;<HI>The&s;e things are written that ye might believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life through his name. John XX. 31.</HI></P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles al&s;o con&s;tantly incouraged free inquiry, as it is natural for hone&s;t unde&s;igning men to do. It is for the intere&s;t of &s;ome to di&s;courage it, and to keep people muffled up in darkne&s;s and ignorance, that &s;o they may &s;ubmit to their dictates with the more readine&s;s and humility. Their <HI>craft is in danger</HI> of being detected, and their doctrine, of being exploded, as &s;oon as people have &s;o much pre&s;umption as to open their eyes. Free inquiry bodes ill to the de&s;ign which they are ingaged in; for they are &s;en&s;ible it will not be &s;afe for them&s;elves to be <HI>knaves</HI> any longer than others are <HI>fools.</HI> But he that has nothing in view but the intere&s;t of truth and virtue, de&s;ires nothing more, than that per&s;ons would give them|&s;elves the trouble of a free and impartial examination. Now the apo&s;tles knowing the goodne&s;s of their cau&s;e, and following the example of their divine Ma&s;ter, made
<PB N="53" REF="006365_0056_1028AF939F9EDD28">
it their practice to incourage liberty and freedom of thought; never intimating, a mo&s;t of their <HI>pretended &s;ucce&s;&s;ors</HI> have done, that this is hazardous to men's &s;ouls.</P>
<P>IN the apo&s;tolic age there were many impo&s;tors and enthu&s;ia&s;ts; fal&s;e pretenders to in&s;piration, as there are at pre&s;ent, and as there have been in almo&s;t every age of the chri&s;tian church. And for this rea&s;on the apo&s;tles directed chri&s;tians to examine the preten&s;ions of all, that &s;o they might di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt really in&s;pired per&s;ons and deceivers&mdash;Thus 1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 1. <HI>Beloved, believe not every &s;pirit; but try the &s;pirits, whether they are of God; for many fal&s;e &s;pirits are gone out into the world.</HI> No one, &s;urely, will be &s;o ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e this was a direc|tion to <HI>try deceivers only;</HI> and not <HI>true</HI> prophets and apo&s;tles. For this would &s;uppo&s;e that they might be known one from the other, without <HI>trying</HI> them at all: and then no examination of either of them would be nece&s;&s;ary. "Determine fir&s;t; and then examine," is the <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> advice of &s;ome <HI>grave divines:</HI> But the apo&s;tles exhorts us to examine all things, before we be|lieve any thing. The <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Berea</HI> are celebrated, Acts xvii. 10. and onwards for not believing the apo&s;tles them&s;elves without critically examining their doctrine, and comparing it with the writings of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the prophets: and in the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age, an implicit cen&s;ure at lea&s;t, is pa&s;&s;ed upon the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> as being indo|lent, credulous, and too ea&s;y of belief. The words of the hi&s;torian are the&s;e, <HI>And the brethren&mdash;&s;ent away Paul and Silas&mdash;unto Berea; who coming there, went into the &s;ynagogue of the Jews. The&s;e were more noble than tho&s;e of The&s;&s;alonica; for they received the word with all rea|dine&s;s of mind: and &s;earched the &s;criptures daily whether tho&s;e things were &s;o.</HI> By their <HI>receiving the word with all readine&s;s of mind,</HI> nothing more is here intended, than that they gave a ready and candid attention to what <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> had to &s;ay: Afterwards, like prudent and
<PB N="54" REF="006365_0057_1028AFDA81EE08A8">
rational men, they examined into the truth of it. And it follows immediately in the next ver&s;e&mdash;<HI>There|fore many of them believed</HI>&mdash;A natural con&s;equence of a free and impartial inquiry into the grounds of the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> religion. I ob&s;erved above, that the <HI>The&s;&s;alo|nians</HI> are cen&s;ured in this pa&s;&s;age, for their credulity, and not u&s;ing &s;uitable precaution in receiving chri&s;tianity. And it is probable that the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> had a view at this incurious and over credulous humour of theirs, in his 1 Epi&s;tle to them, Chap. v. ver. 21. <HI>Prove</HI> (or examine) <HI>all things,</HI> &s;ays he; <HI>hold fast that which is good.</HI> This advice was, indeed, proper for all; but peculiarly &s;o for tho&s;e who were backward to examine, and forward to believe, the&s;e being in the greate&s;t dan|ger of being &s;educed.</P>
<P>AGAIN, What be&s;ides free inquiry after truth and knowledge, does the apo&s;tle intend, Phil. xix. 10? <HI>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment, that ye may approve things that are excellent</HI>&mdash;(Or as &s;ome under&s;tand the&s;e la&s;t words, <HI>that ye may try things that differ, and are controverted.</HI>) To the &s;ame purpo&s;e are the Words of this apo&s;tle, <HI>Eph.</HI> vi. 14, 15. <HI>That we be henceforth no more children, to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the &s;leight of men, and cunning craftine&s;s whereby they lye in wait to deceive: but &s;peak|ing the truth in love,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>I &s;hall, however, beg leave, from what has been &s;aid already, to look upon the point as proved; and &s;o to clo&s;e with a few reflections &s;uitable to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IT appears, then, that all who any ways di&s;courage freedom of inquiry and judgment in religious matters, are, &s;o far forth as they are guilty of this, encroachers upon the natural rights of mankind; that they &s;et up their own authority in oppo&s;ition to that of al|mighty God; and that they are enemies to truth, and the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;They are encroachers upon the natural rights of mankind, becau&s;e it is the natural

<P>THOSE that are guilty of this crime in the highe&s;t degree, are &s;uch as inflict capital puni&s;hments upon tho&s;e that embrace opinions contrary to their own.

<P>IN a &s;omewhat lower degree are they chargeable with the &s;ame crime, who puni&s;h <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI> and <HI>non-&s;ub&s;cribers,</HI> by fines and impri&s;onments, and by de|priving them of tho&s;e civil privileges, emoluments and honours, which, as good &s;ubjects and friends, to the &s;tate, they might ju&s;tly expect. It is well known in what church this inhuman practice has been carried to a prodigious length: and in which it is not yet wholly laid a&s;ide. It is well that, not <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> but <HI>another Per&s;on,</HI> is &s;aid to be the <HI>&s;upreme Head</HI> of this church.

<P>AGAIN: Another practice akin to tho&s;e mentioned above, and which has an apparent tendency to hinder men from judging for them&s;elves, is that of <HI>Creed-making;</HI> &s;etting up human te&s;ts of <HI>orthodoxy,</HI> in&s;tead of the infallible word of God; and making other terms of chri&s;tian communion than tho&s;e explicitly pointed out in the go&s;pel. For any man, or any &s;et of men whatever, to do thus, is plainly to arrogate to them|&s;elves the right of judging for their neighbours; and to deter people, as far as they are able, from &s;eeing with their own eyes, and <HI>judging even of them&s;elves what is right.</HI> Indeed this practice is not &s;o criminal as that of per&s;ecuting and murthering men for their re|ligious &s;entiments: for any rea&s;onable man had rather

For when a creed is begun, or eked out with &s;everal reverend, eccle&s;ia&s;tical cur&s;es; and when it is confidently affirmed, that <HI>unle&s;s a man believe faithfully</HI> every article contained in it, <HI>he &s;hall without doubt peri&s;h everla&s;tingly;</HI> it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the ge|nerality of people &s;hould ever have the courage to he|&s;itate in the lea&s;t concerning the truth of it, although it may be really an affront to common &s;en&s;e, a medly of non&s;en&s;e and contradiction. Nor are there wanting innumerable in&s;tances of per&s;ons, who have, in this way, been fir&s;t frighted out of their &s;en&s;es, and then into the belief of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities; and paying a &s;acred regard to them under the notion of their being orthodox, &s;oul-&s;aving truths and divine my&s;teries&mdash;&s;uch as are not to be examined with rea&s;on, but to be believed and adored without it.</P>
<P>IT is indeed pretended that all the&s;e different me|thods of keeping men from exerci&s;ing their own rati|onal faculties, are entered upon with a very pious and godly de&s;ign; and with an holy zeal to keep here&s;ies out of the church; to reclaim tho&s;e that are un&s;ound in the faith; and to pre&s;erve the chri&s;tian verity pure and undefiled. But the proud, domineering, unchri&s;tian &s;pirit that has been betrayed by the&s;e holy murtherers, robbers, and faith-impo&s;ers, leaves us but little room to think that they were actuated by a real concern for the intere&s;ts of chri&s;tianity, and the &s;alvation of men's &s;ouls.

and to fall in with the opinions of the rich and pow|erful, which is the road to wealth and preferment. And there is really much more need of incouraging freedom of thought, and an inqui&s;itive turn of mind, by hand&s;ome gratuities; than there is of keeping people in the old beaten track by the terror of penal laws, gibbets, inqui&s;itions, <HI>&s;piritual</HI> courts, and <HI>carnal</HI> cur&s;es.

But whether the&s;e are the triumphs of <HI>real heroes,</HI> or only the vain <HI>ga&s;conades</HI> and <HI>Te Deums</HI> of <HI>imaginary conquerors,</HI> will, perhaps, be ea&s;y to determine, when we come to take a view of their <HI>weapons,</HI> and to &s;ee the manner in which they have employed them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not have much regard to order and method in propo&s;ing the objections now to be con&s;idered; but mention them ju&s;t as they pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my mind. And, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, it may be ob|jected,</P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>THAT God him&s;elf under the <HI>mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;a|tion,</HI> required that <HI>idolaters,</HI> and <HI>di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church,</HI> &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death.</Q> From hence it may be argued, <Q>That uncontrouled liberty in religious matters ought not to be allowed of; but the <HI>true church</HI> is obliged in duty to re&s;train and correct infidels and &s;chi&s;maticks; and all in ge|neral that &s;he judges unfound in the faith.</Q></P>
<P>To this it may be an&s;wered,</P>
<P>1&s;t. THAT we cannot argue from what was lawful un|der the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> oeconomy, to what is lawful &s;ince that is aboli&s;hed, and &s;uper&s;eded by another &s;o different from it as the <HI>chri&s;tian.</HI> There might be, and doubtle&s;s were, &s;ome peculiar rea&s;ons for authorizing and enjoining &s;uch a <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> then, which do not take place at pre&s;ent. This might be as peculiar to <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> as <HI>circumci&s;ion,</HI> or the <HI>&s;acrificing</HI> of bea&s;ts, &amp;c. And in reality it does not any more follow from the <HI>Jews</HI> being commanded
<PB N="67" REF="006365_0070_1028AFA6D8AA4CF0">
to extirpate idolaters, that chri&s;tians may de&s;troy hea|thens and hereticks, than it does from <HI>Abraham's</HI> being commanded to &s;acrifice his <HI>&s;on,</HI> that all <HI>parents</HI> may and ought to &s;acrifice their <HI>children</HI> now.</P>
<P>IT is to be remembred, that <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> was at lea&s;t as much a <HI>political</HI> as a <HI>religious</HI> in&s;titution. The <HI>Jews</HI> had God for their immediate <HI>king</HI> and <HI>lawgiver,</HI> both in <HI>church</HI> and <HI>&s;tate.</HI> Their <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> polity were blended together; and being derived from the &s;ame &s;ource, every violation of the law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> might be con&s;idered and puni&s;hed as an offence again&s;t the &s;tate, in a greater or le&s;s degree: And <HI>idolatry</HI> being in the&s;e circum&s;tances equivalent to <HI>high trea&s;on,</HI> it is not &s;trange that a capital puni&s;hment &s;hould be annexed to it. But the ca&s;e is much altered &s;ince the promulgation of the chri&s;tian religion. Chri&s;t's kingdom is not at all a <HI>kingdom of this world.</HI> It is wholly a religious in&s;titu|tion. The laws, the penalties, the rewards of it, are wholly of a &s;piritual nature: And men are to be won over to it, and kept in it, only by &s;piritual and moral means.</P>
<P>BUT 2dly, If the <HI>true church</HI> ought to puni&s;h &s;uch as &s;he looks upon to be erroneous, heretical or &s;chi&s;matical, then a war mu&s;t immediately commence in <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> and continue till all are de&s;troyed, but one party: For each &s;ect thinks it&s;elf in the right; and that all the re&s;t are tinctured with here&s;y: This mu&s;t certainly be the con&s;e|quence of this maxim, that the right of u&s;ing violence and per&s;ecution is the prerogative of the true church; which one would think &s;ufficient to convince any rea&s;on|able man, that the maxim is fal&s;e. Be&s;ides, from whence comes this doctrine, that true orthodox chri&s;tians have a right to per&s;ecute hereticks and unbelievers? (i. e. to be <HI>more wicked</HI> and <HI>immoral</HI> than hereticks and unbeliev|ers?) The &s;cripture, indeed, (and experience very of|ten) teaches us, that <HI>tho&s;e who will live godly in Chri&s;t
<PB N="68" REF="006365_0071_1028AFEF85197B20">
Je&s;us, mu&s;t</HI> &s;uffer per&s;ecution; but not, that they mu&s;t <HI>per&s;ecute others.</HI></P>
<P>BUT perhaps it will be objected in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place,</P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>THAT our Lord him&s;elf required his apo&s;tles to u&s;e external force, in order to bring men over to the true faith, if gentler methods failed of &s;ucce&s;s.</Q> The objection will be taken from the <HI>parable of the &s;upper, Luke</HI> 14. When the gue&s;ts that were bidden, refu&s;ed the invitation, the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t is repre&s;ented as &s;aying to his &s;ervant, ver. 23. <HI>Go out into the high ways and hedges, and</HI> compel <HI>them to come in, that my hou&s;e may be filled.</HI> <Q>Now as the &s;ervant was commanded to <HI>compel</HI> the gue&s;ts to come to the &s;upper, &s;o the apo|&s;tles were injoined to u&s;e external violence, if nece&s;&s;a|ry, in order to bring men over to a belief of the go&s;|pel; from whence it follows that men are not left to their freedom in religious matters.</Q> The</P>
<P>1&s;t THING I would ob&s;erve with relation to this ob|jection is, that great caution is nece&s;&s;ary in the applica|tion of parables and allegories, le&s;t the &s;imilitude &s;hould be carried farther than was originally intended. Nor is it by any means &s;afe to build &s;uch a doctrine, (or rather &s;uch a practice) as that of compul&s;ion in religious mat|ters, but upon the mo&s;t plain and expre&s;s command.</P>
<P>2dly, THIS parable, at mo&s;t, only authorizes the com|pelling of <HI>infidels</HI> to embrace the go&s;pel: And &s;o it has nothing to do with the controver&s;ies among&s;t the differ|ent &s;ects of chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>3dly, ALTHOUGH it &s;hould be allowed, that this pa|rable injoined the <HI>in&s;pired</HI> apo&s;tles to compel men, by external violence, to embrace chri&s;tianity, it will not fol|low that <HI>unin&s;pired</HI> men &s;ince, men who have no commi&s;|&s;ion <HI>immediately</HI> from heaven, have a right to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="006365_0072_1028AFA993E110C8">
4thly, IT is to be ob&s;erved, that according to the pa|rable, the per&s;ons to be compelled are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>&s;ame</HI> who had before ob&s;tinately rejected the kind invitation given them; but &s;uch as had not yet been &s;ent to. For when the ma&s;ter &s;ends out his &s;ervant a &s;econd time, to compel people to <HI>come in,</HI> it follows&mdash;<HI>For I &s;ay unto you that tho&s;e men who were hidden, &s;hall not ta&s;te of my &s;upper.</HI> So that even according to this parable, tho&s;e who will not be per&s;waded by gentle methods, are to be given over, and not to have any farther means u&s;ed with them. From whence it follows,</P>
<P>5thly, THAT none at all are to be compelled by ex|ternal violence: for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that force &s;hould be applied fir&s;t of all; and before other methods prove ineffectual, if at all.</P>
<P>6thly, EITHER the apo&s;tles did not under&s;tand this as a command to u&s;e violence in propagating chri&s;tian|ity, or they neglected to obey it; neither of which can be &s;uppo&s;ed, had there really been &s;uch a command. They never attempted to u&s;e force; but declared, on the contrary, that <HI>the weapons of their warfare were not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of &s;trong holds,</HI> &amp;c. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> X. 4.</P>
<P>7thly, THAT this cannot be the &s;en&s;e of the parable, appears from hence, that it is, in the nature of the thing, impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>force</HI> men really to believe the go&s;pel, and become good chri&s;tians, though one had more <HI>dragoons</HI> to employ in this <HI>pious work,</HI> than <HI>Louis</HI> the XIVth &s;ent to convert the <HI>Hugonots.</HI> Faith and repentance are the work of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of God; and cannot be wrought in a man by a <HI>cudgel,</HI> a <HI>&s;word,</HI> or a <HI>gallows.</HI></P>
<P>8thly, WERE this in it&s;elf po&s;&s;ible, how could twelve <HI>unarmed</HI> apo&s;tles, who were allowed to carry only a <HI>&s;taff</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="006365_0073_1028AFF109B35278">
with them in their journies, convert the whole world by force of arms?</P>
<P>9thly, AND <HI>la&s;tly;</HI> After all the flouri&s;h that has been made with this pa&s;&s;age by <HI>Roman-Catholicks,</HI> and <HI>popi&s;h Protestants,</HI> the word we render <HI>compel,</HI> as often &s;ignifies a <HI>moral,</HI> as a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> compul&s;ion. And the &s;ubject here &s;poken of, nece&s;&s;arily determines it to &s;uch a &s;ignification in this place. It is as if the <HI>ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t</HI> had &s;aid to his &s;ervant, <Q>Since the per&s;ons before invited to my &s;upper, [the <HI>Jews</HI>] refu&s;e to come, go to others, [the <HI>Gentile</HI> nations] and give them the &s;ame invitation: And u&s;e the greate&s;t importunity with them; rea&s;on with them, exhort and per&s;wade them; u&s;e all ra|tional methods to convince them, and bring them in.</Q></P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t proceed to another objection: And per|haps one may be urged in &s;ome &s;uch manner as this&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>IF every man is allowed to think and judge for him&s;elf, the con&s;equence will be that many will fall into erroneous and hurtful opinions. This doctrine opens a door for here&s;ies to enter into the church: it gives men a liberty to trample upon all our creeds and confe&s;&s;ions of faith; to depart from the doctrines of their pious fore-fathers; and to de&s;pi&s;e their &s;piritual guides. And what will this i&s;&s;ue in, but the over|throw of all religion.</Q> To this objection I would an&s;wer,</P>
<P>1&s;t. THAT it does not follow from men's being at liberty to judge for them&s;elves, and to chu&s;e their own religion, that they are at liberty to judge wrong, and to reject the true religion, let it be what it will. If they are obliged to judge and chu&s;e, for them&s;elves at all, they are obliged to judge truly and ju&s;tly, and to reject only what is wrong. The right of private judgmen
<PB N="71" REF="006365_0074_1028AFAB487000F0">
does not imply, that it is indifferent whether a man judges truly, or not, any more than a man's right of di&s;po&s;ing of his own property, implies that he may as innocently &s;quander it away in rioting and drunkenne&s;s, as pay his debts with it, or appropriate it to charitable u&s;es. As a man has not a right to do what is wrong with his own &s;ub&s;tance, &s;o neither has he any, to judge wrong with his own under&s;tanding. He is under a moral obligation to reject error, and to embrace truth, as far as he is able to detect the former, and to di&s;cern the latter.</P>
<P>2dly, AS the right of private judgment, does not leave men at liberty to judge wrong, and to embrace a fal&s;e religion; &s;o neither has the exerci&s;ing that right any tendency to mi&s;lead men, as the objection &s;uppo&s;es. The tendency of it is directly the contrary way. Free examination, weighing arguments <HI>for,</HI> and <HI>again&s;t,</HI> with impartiality, is the way to find the truth. Who ima|gines that free inquiry into philo&s;ophical &s;ubjects, has any tendency to lead men into a wrong idea of the na|tural world? No one was ever &s;o infatuated as to a&s;&s;ert this. And it is in all re&s;pects as improbable, that free enquiry into religious &s;ubjects &s;hould lead us into wrong notions concerning the moral world. One would think that a man who had received his religious principles upon mature and deliberate con&s;ideration, and &s;o had in his own mind rational arguments to &s;upport them, could not have the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of their &s;uffering any thing by being thoroughly &s;canned and examined to the bottom. Error and impo&s;ture fly from the light, like the <HI>owl</HI> and <HI>bat:</HI> But truth and hone&s;ty, like the noble <HI>eagle,</HI> face to the &s;un. The cau&s;e of error and &s;uper&s;ti|tion may &s;uffer by a critical examination; its &s;ecurity is to lurk in the dark: But the true religion flouri&s;hes the more, the more people exerci&s;e their right of private judgment. This is apparent: And therefore it is no uncharitablene&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e, that all who are backward to have their doctrines called in que&s;tion, and to &s;tand a
<PB N="72" REF="006365_0075_1028AFF3C075F350">
fair trial at the bar of impartial rea&s;on, have at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;ecret &s;u&s;picion in their own minds, that they will not &s;tand the te&s;t, and <HI>come forth as gold when it is tried,</HI> but be found no better than <HI>dro&s;s.</HI> We pay but a bad compliment to our religion, when we cry out that it is in danger, if men are left to the free exerci&s;e of their own rational faculties in judging of it. A man that is con|&s;cious his cau&s;e at court is good, chu&s;es it &s;hould be tried by the mo&s;t &s;evere and critical eye. But he that either knows, or &s;u&s;pects, he has a dirty one, had much rather that people would &s;pare them&s;elves the trouble of exa|mining into its merits, and take his own word for the goodne&s;s of it. But</P>
<P>3dly, As to the lamentable havock which the objec|tion &s;uppo&s;es will be made among&s;t our <HI>creeds</HI> and <HI>for|mularies,</HI> if the doctrine of free inquiry &s;hould prevail; this is, doubtle&s;s, a very natural con&s;equence: for this would probably prove fatal, at lea&s;t to many articles contained in them. For it is plain that many of them are &s;tuffed with the mo&s;t ridiculous jargon, and are as contrary to &s;cripture, as they are to common &s;en&s;e. But this, in&s;tead of being an objection again&s;t free inquiry, is one of the &s;tronge&s;t arguments for it. If the&s;e creeds and formularies were true, agreeable to rea&s;on and reve|lation, the more thoroughly they are examined the bet|ter; for then their truth would appear: But if they are fal&s;e, it is &s;till be&s;t they &s;hould be examined, in order to their being exploded. It is no matter how <HI>old,</HI> or how <HI>new</HI> they are. Truth does not die with age, and then revive again, as is fabled of the <HI>phaenix:</HI> it flou|ri&s;hes in immortal youth. Error may indeed become <HI>venerable</HI> and <HI>gray headed</HI> with length of time: but a fal&s;hood of a thou&s;and years &s;tanding, remains as much a fal&s;hood as ever, although it may have been con&s;ecrated by the church, and tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity in a creed. Whatever truths it may have had to <HI>keep it company;</HI> and however it may have been pre&s;erved amid&s;t the
<PB N="73" REF="006365_0076_1028AFAF59D37EF8">
&s;torms that have beat upon the church, it is only like one of <HI>Noah's unclean bea&s;ts</HI> pre&s;erved in the <HI>ark,</HI> among&s;t tho&s;e of a pure, and more u&s;eful nature. There is no|thing more fooli&s;h and &s;uper&s;titious than a veneration for <HI>ancient</HI> creeds and doctrines, <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> and nothing more unworthy a rea&s;onable creature, than to value <HI>principles</HI> by their <HI>age,</HI> as &s;ome do their <HI>wines.</HI> But, in|deed, this is as common as it is ridiculous. With many people, "Antiquity! Antiquity! Antiquity!" is the cry: And, <Q>Who will be &s;o hardy as to di&s;pute the truth of what was believed a thou&s;and years ago?</Q> Ju&s;t as if what was fal&s;e formerly, were not &s;o &s;till; but might be ripened and refined by age into a <HI>doctrine of grace.</HI> Mo&s;t things are, indeed, changed by <HI>time. Time</HI> makes the child a man: <HI>Time</HI> makes the ignorant wi&s;e: <HI>Time</HI> often turns a friend into a foe, and a foe into a friend: <HI>The fa&s;hion of the world pa&s;&s;eth away</HI> by <HI>time:</HI> And <HI>time</HI> &s;hall change the whole face of nature. But truth, like the <HI>Father of lights,</HI> is without <HI>variablene&s;s,</HI> or <HI>&s;hadow of turning.</HI></P>
<P>To proceed,</P>
<P>4thly, IT is &s;uppo&s;ed in the la&s;t mentioned objection, that freedom of inquiry will naturally bring our <HI>&s;piritual guides</HI> into contempt, and weaken their authority. To this I reply, That it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be of any di&s;advan|tage to the &s;ober and rational part of the <HI>clergy;</HI> but has a tendency to make them more e&s;teemed. But as to the vain and proud; the ignorant and a&s;&s;uming; the enthu&s;ia&s;tic and &s;uper&s;titious; it has doubtle&s;s a natural tendency to bring the&s;e into contempt: And the &s;ooner the better, that &s;o they may not have &s;o much power to do mi&s;chief. The&s;e are the per&s;ons that are generally the mo&s;t aver&s;e to people's &s;eeing and judging for them|&s;elves: And the rea&s;on why they are &s;o, is too apparent to need mentioning. But</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="006365_0077_1028AFF547847040">
5thly, AND <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> Upon &s;uppo&s;ition that the cau&s;e of truth and real religion, might &s;uffer in &s;ome re&s;pects, by per&s;ons exerci&s;ing their right of private judgment; yet this is no ju&s;t rea&s;on for denying them &s;uch a liber|ty. This right is given them by God and nature, and the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: And no man has a right to de|prive another of it, under a notion that he will make an ill u&s;e of it, and fall into erroneous opinions. We may as well pick our neighbour's pocket, for fear he &s;hould &s;pend his money in debauchery, as take from him his right of judging for him&s;elf, and chu&s;ing his religion, for fear he &s;hould judge ami&s;s and abu&s;e his liberty.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to another objection, which is fre|quently urged with a great deal of confidence, and very little rea&s;on. It is near akin to that la&s;t mentioned; and may be put into &s;ome &s;uch form as this,</P>
<P N="4">4. <Q>IF all are left at liberty to chu&s;e their own reli|gion, and to enjoy it unmole&s;ted, we &s;hall have innu|merable <HI>&s;ects</HI> &s;pringing up among&s;t us; which tends to <HI>confu&s;ion,</HI> and de&s;troys the <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>unity of the church.</HI> It is therefore expedient that the <HI>governors of the church</HI> &s;hould injoin upon all, the belief of certain articles of faith, and the ob&s;ervation of certain modes and rites of wor&s;hip. Without &s;ome common rule of faith, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, beyond what the &s;crip|tures contain, there can be no &s;ufficient bond of union among&s;t chri&s;tians. And &s;o the church mu&s;t inevi|tably be crumbled to pieces; whereas there ought to be <HI>no &s;chi&s;m in that &s;piritual body.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WITH relation to this objection I would ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>1&s;t. THAT if any rule of faith, wor&s;hip and di&s;ci|pline, be&s;ides that which our Saviour and his apo&s;tles have left us, be nece&s;&s;ary in order to the peace and good government of the church, then the church had no peace
<PB N="75" REF="006365_0078_1028AFB0DC8B3870">
and was not well governed during the apo&s;tolic age. For chri&s;tians had then no common rule of faith, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline be&s;ides that which they received from our Lord him&s;elf, or his apo&s;tles, who were under the extra|ordinary influence and direction of his &s;pirit. Which rule is tran&s;mitted to us in the writings of the new te&s;tament; and is &s;ufficient <HI>now,</HI> for the regulation of the church, if it was <HI>then.</HI> That this was &s;ufficient then, is not denied; and therefore it cannot be deficient at pre|&s;ent. But</P>
<P>2dly, IF any farther regulations had been nece&s;&s;ary in order to pre&s;erve the peace and unity of the church, it is &s;trange that neither our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who <HI>loved the church and gave him&s;elf for it,</HI> nor the apo&s;tles, who liv'd and dy'd in the &s;ervice of the church, &s;hould have taken more care to provide for its peace and pro&s;perity. Can we &s;uppo&s;e that they did their work to the halves, and left others to fini&s;h and perfect it?</P>
<P>3dly, WHO gave the governors of the church, any authority in matters of faith, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline? Do we find one word of it in &s;cripture? No. The church of Chri&s;t, as &s;uch, has no legi&s;lator be&s;ides Chri&s;t him&s;elf, whom the Father <HI>has made head over all things to the church.</HI> And whatever church that be, who&s;e rulers have any power of legi&s;lation, &s;o far forth it is not the church of Chri&s;t. For Chri&s;t equally forbids all his di&s;ciples to a&s;&s;ume authority over their brethren; and to &s;ubmit to any who &s;hall arrogate to them&s;elves any au|thority in matters of a religious concern.</P>
<P>4thly, and la&s;tly, As no order of men has any au|thority to enjoin the belief of any articles of faith; or the u&s;e of any modes of wor&s;hip, not expre&s;ly and ex|plicitly pointed out in the &s;criptures; &s;o neither has the enjoining any &s;uch, a tendency to pre&s;erve the peace and harmony of the church; but directly the contrary. The
<PB N="76" REF="006365_0079_1028AFF9CDCE1A78">
confu&s;ion and di&s;order that have hitherto been in the church, have not ari&s;en from chri&s;tians exerci&s;ing their own judgment, and wor&s;hipping God according to their con&s;ciences; (though in a manner &s;omewhat different from others) but from the pride and in&s;olence of tho&s;e who deny their chri&s;tian brethren this liberty; and who undertake to pre&s;cribe authoritatively to others what they &s;hall believe, and how they &s;hall wor&s;hip. Were it not for the turbulent, domineering &s;pirit of &s;ome Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, who de&s;ire more power than Chri&s;t &s;aw &s;it to intru&s;t them with, there would be but little of that wrangling and di&s;cord which have hitherto di&s;turbed the peace of the church. The divi&s;ions and contentions that have hitherto happened, and &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the chri&s;tian church, are all, in a manner, owing to the unchri&s;tian temper and conduct of tho&s;e who could not con|tent them&s;elves with <HI>&s;cripture orthodoxy,</HI> with the &s;im|ple and <HI>&s;piritual wor&s;hip of the Father,</HI> enjoined by our Saviour, and with the <HI>platform of church di&s;ci|pline</HI> contained in the new te&s;tament; but mu&s;t go to coining new articles of faith, new modes and rites of wor&s;hip, making new canons, and pre&s;cribing new rules for the regulation of the church. It is about the&s;e com|paratively novel inventions, that the governors and <HI>fathers of the church,</HI> (as &s;ome affect to call them) have generally been more warm and zealous, than about an holy and godly life. They have ordinarily given pretty good quarter to the mo&s;t vicious and debauched of men, provided their own authority was acknowledged; their own peculiar whim&s;ies embraced; and their <HI>decent</HI> (or rather ridiculous) <HI>forms</HI> and <HI>ceremonies</HI> were religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved. But the mo&s;t peaceable, &s;ober and virtuous per&s;ons, who would not &s;ubmit to their tyrannical yoke, have all along been treated with contempt and inhuma|nity, as being hereticks, &s;ci&s;maticks, &amp;c. And all this, perhaps only for not practi&s;ing &s;uch rites, as have no more relation to chri&s;tianity than <HI>telling beeds,</HI> or <HI>cracking the fingers;</HI> and for not believing &s;uch doctrines as have

no more to do with the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, than the idle &s;tories of <HI>bell and the dragon,</HI> or <HI>Tobit and his dog.</HI> Here is the true &s;ource of religious di&s;cord. Had Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, in&s;tead of <HI>lording it our God's heri|tage,</HI> and &s;etting up their own authority in the room of Chri&s;t's, put on <HI>the meekne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of Chri&s;t;</HI> and &s;et a better <HI>example to the flock;</HI> had they endeavoured to remove all <HI>&s;tumbling blocks</HI> out of the way, in&s;tead of in&s;i&s;ting upon indifferent things as nece&s;&s;ary terms of chri&s;tian communion; had they taught and practi&s;ed <HI>the weightier matters of law,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;pending their zeal upon trifles; had they taught mutual forbearance and charity, in&s;tead of fomenting a furious party &s;pirit, and exciting ignorant bigots to rail at &s;ober peaceable chri|&s;tians; had they done thus, the peace and harmony of the church might have been very well pre&s;erved, without <HI>creeds</HI> and <HI>formularies,</HI> or an exact uniformity in faith and wor&s;hip. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and his apo&s;tles, it is plain, have left matters &s;o that there may be a con&s;iderable latitude and difference in the &s;entiments of good chri|&s;tians, and in the manner of their wor&s;hip. But <HI>His</HI> am|ba&s;&s;adors, and <HI>their</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, it &s;eems, have found out that this is a great defect. Accordingly they under|take to &s;upply it, under the notion of pre&s;erving the peace of the church. And this is what has hitherto been, and mu&s;t continue to be, the cau&s;e of angry de|bates and endle&s;s contentions; a means of dividing the church, in &s;tead of uniting it; and of in&s;piring chri&s;tians with mutual rage, in&s;tead of mutual love and brotherly affection.</P>
<P>IT may be objected, in the <HI>fifth</HI> place,</P>
<P N="5">5. <Q>THAT the doctrine of private judgment is in|con&s;i&s;tent with that of a &s;tanding mini&s;try in the chri|&s;tian church, appointed by Chri&s;t to in&s;truct people in religious matters. An order of men was divinely in|&s;tituted to do the office of <HI>in&s;tructors,</HI> or <HI>teachers</HI> in the
<PB N="78" REF="006365_0081_1028AFFE0A12B088">
church: Con&s;equently there mu&s;t be others who&s;e duty it is to <HI>learn of them,</HI> and not to pretend to a right of judging for them&s;elves. It is incumbent upon the <HI>Laiety</HI> to go to their &s;piritual guides; and to receive their in&s;tructions with humility and rever|ence, without pretending to di&s;pute the truth of what they a&s;&s;ert in the name of the Lord.</Q> This, we know, is the manner in which many expre&s;s them&s;elves upon this &s;ubject. And the po&s;itive, dogmatical air with which mo&s;t of our pulpit-di&s;cour&s;es are delivered is a &s;ufficient proof, that the&s;e &s;entiments are adopted by the generality of tho&s;e that &s;tile them&s;elves the <HI>amba&s;&s;a|dors of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> But to this objection it may be an&s;wered in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P>1&s;t. THAT, allowing there is &s;omewhere in the chri&s;tian church, a &s;et of Men who&s;e office it is to teach authoritative|ly, and by divine right, &s;till people mu&s;t judge for them|&s;elves <HI>who the&s;e men are.</HI> Almo&s;t all publick teachers of religion pretend a divine right to be &s;o. But they do not all teach the &s;ame doctrines. How then &s;hall we know whom to chu&s;e for our &s;piritual in&s;tructor, without exa|mining into, and judging upon, the claims of tho&s;e who demand our attention, and the direction of our under|&s;tandings and con&s;ciences? But</P>
<P>2ly. SUPPOSING we have found who the&s;e per&s;ons are, to whom this authority is given, it does not follow that they are to be <HI>implicitly</HI> believed in every thing they &s;ay, or even in any thing. No man is to be believed implicitly, unle&s;s he is infallible: but infallibility is not nece&s;&s;arily connected with a divine right to teach. Al|though it &s;hould be allowed, that kings reign by divine right, in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e pleaded for by the advocates for <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience</HI> and <HI>non-re&s;i&s;tence,</HI> &s;till it is po&s;&s;ible that they may make an ill u&s;e of their power; command things expre&s;ly forbidden by God, and forbid what God has injoined. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, it will be allowed
<PB N="79" REF="006365_0082_1028AFB6B9120BE0">
that they have no title to the active obedience of their &s;ubjects. So al&s;o, he that has a divine right to in&s;truct others in religion, may po&s;&s;ibly &s;peak fal&s;e, either ig|norantly or with de&s;ign: And if he does &s;o, no one will be &s;o extravagant as to &s;ay, that he ought to be believed. God has given him a right to teach; but it is only to teach truth; if, therefore, he <HI>teaches for doctrines the commandments of men,</HI> and lies, for the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, he exceeds his commi&s;&s;ion; and has no more right to demand our a&s;&s;ent, than any other liar, or deceiver who is <HI>uncon&s;ecrat|ed.</HI> So that let us carry our idea of the authority of chri&s;ti|an teachers ever &s;o high, yet if we &s;top &s;hort of infallibity, we are in rea&s;on obliged to examine all that they &s;ay, and either to receive or reject it, as evidence of its truth does, or does not appear. Even the apo&s;tles them|&s;elves (who were divinely authorized teachers in a much higher and more proper &s;en&s;e than any &s;et of men can pretend to be at this day) never pretended to &s;uch a right of dictating to others what they &s;hould believe and do, as interfered with the right of private judgment. Chri|&s;tian teachers in after ages are (or at lea&s;t ought to be) only <HI>commentators</HI> upon the &s;criptures: and we cannot &s;uppo&s;e their <HI>commentaries</HI> have greater weight and authority than the <HI>text</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>A man of &s;uperior knowledge and integrity may be of great advantage in a chri&s;tian &s;ociety, by helping his brethren and neighbours to a right under&s;tanding of the &s;criptures, although he be not infallible, and although nothing he advances is to be received for truth without examination and proof. We have <HI>authorized</HI> profe&s;&s;ors and teachers of <HI>law, phy&s;ic, philo&s;ophy,</HI> &amp;c. who are doubtle&s;s helpful to &s;uch as devote them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of the&s;e &s;ciences. But who ever imagined that the end of their in&s;titution was authoritatively to dictate what is true in their re&s;pective provinces, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as to preclude examination; and to render it unnece&s;&s;ary for their pupils and auditors to inquire into the founda|tion
<PB N="80" REF="006365_0083_1028AFFF8E022A98">
of what they a&s;&s;ert? This is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e, that 'tis confe&s;&s;ed their chief bu&s;ine&s;s is to open and enlarge the minds of their &s;cholars; to propo&s;e rea&s;ons and arguments to their under&s;tandings, and to endea|vour to make them apprehend their force; and in this way to bring them acquainted with the &s;ciences to which they re&s;pectively apply them&s;elves. A <HI>mathematician</HI> would think his pupil had made but a &s;mall proficiency, if he only believed upon <HI>authority,</HI> all the propo&s;itions in <HI>Euclid,</HI> and other books of the &s;ame kind, without &s;eeing what principles they were grounded upon, or be|ing able to demon&s;trate them him&s;elf. And as the bu|&s;ine&s;s of an in&s;tructor is not to inforce certain dogma's purely by dint of authority; &s;o the bu|&s;ine&s;s of a learner is not to receive for truth whatever his in&s;tructor in any &s;cience advances as &s;uch; but to exerci&s;e his own intellectual powers, and to enter into the rea&s;ons and grounds of what is taught, and to receive nothing without evidence. No one imagines that a per|&s;on's exerci&s;ing his own under&s;tanding in this manner, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the notion of his having &s;omebody to lead and in&s;truct him in any branch of natural know|ledge. And the ca&s;e is much the &s;ame in morals and religion. A man's being an authorized (if you plea&s;e, a <HI>divinely</HI> authorized) in&s;tructor in religious matters, is no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with the right of private judgment in others. Indeed if they reject the truth when it is &s;uffi|ciently proved, they do it at their peril; and that, let it be offered by whom it will. But &s;till all are left at as much liberty to examine and judge for them&s;elves, as if there were no public teachers at all.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the <HI>&s;ixth,</HI> and la&s;t objection I &s;hall have time to con&s;ider. The objection I intend may be put into &s;ome &s;uch form as this&mdash;</P>
<P N="6">6. <Q>ALTHOUGH men may be at liberty to judge for them&s;elves, and to chu&s;e their own religion, when
<PB N="81" REF="006365_0084_1028AFBAA9AF5F18">
the <HI>civil magi&s;trate</HI> does not interpo&s;e with his autho|rity; yet when articles of faith have once received a royal &s;anction; and a particular religion is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by the laws of the land; then certainly we are bound to di&s;mi&s;s all our former &s;cruples of con&s;cience, and to &s;ubmit to the <HI>religion of the &s;tate.</HI> For the a|po&s;tle has told us expre&s;ly, That <HI>the powers that be, are ordained of God, that he that re&s;isteth the power, re|&s;isteth the ordinance of God, and &s;hall receive to him&s;elf damnation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to this objection, I would beg leave to query in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, whether chri&s;tians are bound in con&s;cience to believe and conform to that religion, what|ever it be, which is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, in the countries where they re&s;pectively live? This is a plain que&s;tion: and they either are, or are not &s;o obliged. There is no medium. If they are not &s;o obliged, but only in ca&s;e they apprehend the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion is agreeable to the word and will of God, this &s;uppo&s;es a right of pri|vate judgment, and &s;o gives up the whole point in de|bate. But on the other hand, if they are bound in con|&s;cience to conform in the manner before expre&s;&s;ed, from hence it follows, that he that lives in <HI>Scotland</HI> is bound in con&s;cience to be a <HI>Pre&s;byterian;</HI> he that lives in <HI>Eng|land</HI> to be an <HI>Epi&s;copalian;</HI> he that lives in <HI>Italy, France, Spain</HI> or <HI>Portugal</HI> to be a <HI>Roman Catholick;</HI> he that lives in <HI>Constantinople</HI> mu&s;t be a <HI>Mahometan;</HI> and he that lives in a <HI>Heathen</HI> country, mu&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;ly comply with all the idolatrous rites that are injoined by the civil authority; and &s;o be an <HI>Heathen</HI> in order to obey the <HI>go&s;pel-precept</HI> concerning &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to lawful autho|rity. Moreover, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, it follows that a traveller who has occa&s;ion to pa&s;s through all tho&s;e dif|ferent countries, mu&s;t change his religion with his climate. He mu&s;t be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a <HI>Presbyterian, Epi&s;copalian, Papi&s;t, Mu&s;&s;ulman,</HI> and a <HI>Heathen;</HI> and then be a good <HI>orthodox</HI> believer when he comes into <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> again.
<PB N="82" REF="006365_0085_1028B002A63AE938">
The&s;e con&s;equences are unavoidable upon &s;uppo&s;ition that the &s;ubject ought univer&s;ally to embrace the religion of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate. And &s;ome men will not be &s;hocked at the&s;e con&s;equences; for nothing plea&s;es them better than to change their religion as often as they can with conveniency and profit; oaths and &s;ub&s;criptions are, with them, of no &s;ignification; if they <HI>&s;wear to their own hurt,</HI> it is but to <HI>change.</HI> They are governed by the fa&s;hion in their religion, as much as they are in the cut of their cloaths; they have none but a &s;tate con|&s;cience; and either rail or &s;mile at tho&s;e who are &s;o whim&s;ical and &s;uper&s;titious as to pretend to have any other. What they have to do in order to know the true religion, is not to inquire into the nature of things, and the infallible oracles of God, but to &s;earch the <HI>Codes</HI> and <HI>Regi&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Law-books</HI> in the country where they live. However it is to be hoped that &s;ome others do not trifle with their Maker in this manner; but think it of &s;ome importance to know the will of God; and to obey it con&s;cientiou&s;ly, whatever may be the religion by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. Is it not po&s;&s;ible for the command of the civil magi&s;trate to interfere and cla&s;h with the laws of God? No man will pretend to deny this. Who&s;e authority, then is to be regarded, that of the King, or that of the Monarch of the univer&s;e, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords? Will any man &s;ay it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s as men, and e&s;pecially as chri&s;tians, to judge whether the injunctions of the civil magi&s;trate may be complied with con&s;i&s;tently with our allegiance and loyalty to the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty of heaven and earth? And if they cannot, will any one make it a &s;erious que&s;tion, <HI>whether it is better to obey God or man?</HI> But</P>
<P>2dly. I would humbly inquire how any civil maje&s;trate came by any authority at all in religious matters; and <HI>who gave him this authority?</HI> Has the &s;upreme magi&s;trate of every nation, as &s;uch, a right to make a religion for his &s;ubjects? No. For then a heathen magi&s;trate, would
<PB N="83" REF="006365_0086_1028AFBC2D4585F8">
have a right to enjoin idolatry and pagani&s;m; and to puni&s;h all chri&s;tians that came within his territories, if they would not conform. Does the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t give the chri&s;tian magi&s;trate authority in matters of faith and wor&s;hip? No. It &s;ays not a word about any &s;uch thing. But</P>
<P>3dly. AND la&s;tly here, It is evident beyond all di&s;|pute, that the apo&s;tle in injoining obedience to the civil magi&s;trate, had no thought of injoining obedience to him in religious matters. For all the &s;upreme magi&s;trates then in the world were Pagan; and idolatry was the re|ligion by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. And certainly we cannot &s;up|po&s;e that the apo&s;tles could injoin it as a chri&s;tian duty to embrace the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, when that was di|rectly oppo&s;ite to Chri&s;tianity. To have threatned dam|nation to tho&s;e who di&s;obeyed in this ca&s;e, would have been to threaten damnation to them&s;elves, and to denounce an anathema again&s;t all the chri&s;tians in the world, and even again&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf; for the&s;e were all di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; and thou&s;ands gloriou&s;ly &s;uffered martyrdom, for refu&s;ing to comply with the religion of the &s;tate, and for a&s;&s;erting that right of private judgment which we are now endeavouring to defend.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to <HI>St. Paul,</HI> the magi&s;trate is <HI>ordained of God for a terror to evil doers; and for a prai&s;e to them that do well.</HI> His office is to pre&s;erve the liberties and natural rights of his &s;ubjects, one of the mo&s;t important of which rights is that of private judgment, and an unmole&s;ted enjoyment of a man's own religion, let it be what it will, provided he is a peaceable &s;ub|ject, and a good member of &s;ociety. The&s;e and &s;uch like are the ends for which, according to &s;cripture, the magi&s;trate is ordained of God, and not to make a religion for his &s;ubjects. This would be to invade, and incroach upon, tho&s;e natural rights of his &s;ubjects, which

it is his bu&s;ine&s;s to pre&s;erve inviolable. As the Jews &s;aid occa&s;ionally to <HI>Pilate, We have no king but Cae&s;ar;</HI> &s;o chri&s;tians, as &s;uch, may &s;ay, <HI>We have no king but Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> And they are <HI>traitors</HI> to him their lawful &s;overeign if they &s;wear allegiance to any other as the lord of their faith, and the director of their religious conduct.

<P>THUS I have endeavoured with all po&s;&s;ible brevity and plainne&s;s to an&s;wer the mo&s;t material objections again&s;t freedom of thought, and the rights of con&s;cience in re|ligious concerns. I have aimed at provoking no &s;ect of chri&s;tians whatever; nor at plea&s;ing any; but have &s;poken my &s;entiments, &s;uch as they are, with the hone&s;t &s;implicity that I think becomes a chri&s;tian: And with &s;uch <HI>freedom</HI> as I apprehend is agreable to the cau&s;e I have been attempting to defend; the cau&s;e of <HI>religious liberty;</HI> that liberty which God and the go&s;pel of his Son have granted to us; that liberty, for the &s;ake of which our pious fore-fathers for&s;ook their native land, where they had a <HI>goodly heritage,</HI> and &s;ought a &s;afe retreat in this we&s;tern world, a wilderne&s;s inhabited by &s;avage bea&s;ts and more &s;avage men; though both were le&s;s &s;avage than &s;ome of tho&s;e epi&s;copal blood-thir&s;ty tyrants from who&s;e rage they fled. This is a cau&s;e of no le&s;s importance even to the pre&s;ent happine&s;s of human &s;ociety, than that of civil liberty, in oppo&s;ition to ar|bitrary power. And here I beg leave to u&s;e the words of a truly catholic prelate of <HI>the church of England</HI>&mdash;<Q>To liberty and property, &s;ays he, I add the free exerci&s;e of religion as nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of a governed &s;ociety: becau&s;e as there is no tyranny &s;o odious to God, as tyranny over the con&s;cience; &s;o is there no &s;lavery &s;o unea&s;y and ignominious, as a forced religion, or a wor&s;hip impo&s;ed upon&mdash;men by the fear or applica|tion

of outward inconveniencies: be&s;ides that nothing promotes the flouri&s;hing condition of a nation more than the indulgence of this freedom to all who&s;e prin|ciples are not manife&s;tly incon&s;i&s;tent with the publick &s;afety.</Q> Thus the bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> the noted &s;courge of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny.</P>

<P>LET us take pains to find out the truth, and after we are &s;etled in our judgment concerning any religious tenet or practice, adhere to it with con&s;tancy of mind, till convinced of our error in a rational way. Let us de&s;pi&s;e the frowns and cen&s;ures of tho&s;e vain con|ceited men who &s;et them&s;elves up for the oracles of truth and the &s;tandard of orthodoxy; and then call their neighbours hard names&mdash;We have not only a right to think for our&s;elves in matters of re|ligion, but to act for our&s;elves al&s;o.

<P>DID I &s;ay, we have a <HI>right</HI> to judge and act for our|&s;elves? I now add&mdash;it is our <HI>indi&s;pen&s;ible duty</HI> to do it. This is a right which we cannot relinqui&s;h, or neglect to exerci&s;e, if we would, without being highly culpable; for it is ab&s;olutely unalienable in its own nature. We may di&s;po&s;e of our temporal &s;ub&s;tance if we plea&s;e; but God and nature and the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t injoin it upon us a duty to maintain the right of private judgment, and to wor&s;hip God according to our con&s;ciences, as much as they injoin us to give an alms to the poor, to love God and our neighbour, and practi&s;e univer&s;al righ|teou&s;ne&s;s: and we may as well talk of giving up our right to the <HI>latter,</HI> as the <HI>former.</HI> They are all <HI>duties,</HI> and not <HI>rights</HI> &s;imply; duties equally founded in the rea&s;on of things; duties equally commanded by the &s;ame God; duties equally injoined by the &s;ame Lord; duties equally required in the &s;ame go&s;pel. And a neglect of the duty of private judgment may po&s;&s;ibly be attended with wor&s;e con&s;equences to our&s;elves and others than the neglect of almo&s;t any other. For he that does not examine for him&s;elf what is true and right, acts in|tirely in the dark, and &s;o may run into the mo&s;t irregular and de&s;tructive practices that can be conceived of, ju&s;t as his weak or wicked guides are plea&s;ed to prompt him. He is fit only for a tool to the devil and his emi&s;&s;aries: and may flatter him&s;elf that he is <HI>doing God good &s;ervice,</HI> while he is imbrueing his hands in the blood of the innocent, and per&s;ecuting the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But</P>
<P>2ly. AND to conclude, while we are a&s;&s;erting our own liberty and chri&s;tian rights, let us be con&s;i&s;tent and uni|form; and not attempt to incroach upon the rights of

And nothing is more incongruous than for an advocate for liberty, to tyrannize over his neighbours. We have all liberty to think and act for our&s;elves in things of a religious concern; and we ought to be content with that, without de&s;iring a liberty to oppre&s;s and grieve others. However we have &s;ome ignorant railing zealots among&s;t us, fired with a furious party &s;pirit, who are not &s;atisfyed that they enjoy their own liberty, but mourn that their neighbours enjoy the &s;ame, and that they have it not in their power to afflict them for their religious &s;entiments. They groan under the righteous <HI>act of toleration,</HI> as much as our fathers groaned under the unrighteous one of <HI>uniformity.</HI> However, through mercy, we have but a few men of this &s;tamp among&s;t us; and tho&s;e are &s;uch ignorant and de&s;picable creatures, that they are more proper objects of pity, than of anger.

Let us, <HI>as much as in us lies, live peaceably with all men;</HI> but &s;uffer none to lord it over our con|&s;ciences. Let us avoid a contracted, cen&s;orious &s;pirit in our&s;elves, and pity and de&s;pi&s;e it in others. Let us be courteous and friendly to all men of what denomination &s;oever they be; and how much &s;oever their religious principles may differ from our own. If we think them erroneous, let us not rail at them, but rea&s;on with them in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s. Let us u&s;e no methods but tho&s;e of &s;ober argument and kind per&s;wa&s;ion, in order to bring men over to a belief and practice of <HI>the truth as it is in Je&s;us:</HI> and let us &s;corn tho&s;e who are for u&s;ing any other methods with us. God grant that how different &s;oever our &s;entiments are, we may be united in love and charity; and that chri&s;tians of all per&s;wa&s;ions, and

<P>THAT which renders it a matter of the highe&s;t importance to examine with freedom into moral and religious &s;ubjects, is not &s;o much the advan|tage &s;imply of <HI>knowing</HI> what is <HI>true</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> as the nece&s;&s;ity of this in order to true and right <HI>action.</HI> It is &s;carce of any importance to us to gain a &s;peculative knowledge of true religion, but as this has relation to practice; and may teach us what temper of mind to|wards our Creator, and one another, we ought to culti|vate; and what an external conduct we ought to adorn our lives with, in order to an&s;wer the end of our being;
<PB N="90" REF="006365_0093_1028B00CD9F3C4B0">
in order to our filling up our place in the creation, and acting our part well in the great <HI>drama</HI> of the world. This is the view which ought to accompany all our in|quiries into religious &s;ubjects. If we are &s;ollicitous only about knowing what is true and right, and terminate our de&s;ires in &s;uch knowledge, we pur&s;ue as an end what ought to be looked upon only a means to &s;omewhat farther and beyond, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> &s;uch a conduct as may render us acceptable to our creator, and lay the foundation for rational happine&s;s here and hereafter. Knowledge can hardly be &s;aid to be valuable for its own &s;ake, but only as it may be improved to good and excellent purpo&s;es: Nor is it eventually advantageous to us, any farther than we conform our&s;elves to truth and right in our be|haviour.</P>
<P>FOR what end does the <HI>marriner</HI> &s;tudy the art of <HI>navi|gation?</HI> Not, &s;urely, for this only or chiefly, that he may plea&s;e and amu&s;e him&s;elf with the <HI>theory</HI> of it: but rather, that he may be able to <HI>&s;teer his cour&s;e aright</HI> through the ocean, and arrive &s;afe at length at the port for which he is bound. Without applying his knowledge in this way, all the advantage it will be to him, is that of being <HI>&s;hipwrecked with his eyes open,</HI> while others run upon ruin <HI>blindfold,</HI> and purely through <HI>ignorance.</HI>&mdash;We al&s;o are marriners; bound to <HI>another country,</HI> to <HI>another world.</HI> We &s;ail at pre&s;ent upon a boi&s;terous &s;tormy ocean, in which we are in danger of &s;uffering &s;hipwreck.

And to be <HI>ca&s;taways</HI> through our own negligence, while we know the cour&s;e we &s;hould &s;teer, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, will augment our &s;orrow.

</LIST></P>
<P>I. THEN, let us inquire di&s;tinctly into the nature and obligation of the two duties here mentioned; the fir&s;t of which is expre&s;&s;ed thus, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind.</HI></P>
<P>WE know that in &s;cripture language and indeed in common di&s;cour&s;e, it is u&s;ual for one duty or virtue to &s;tand for all the re&s;t. <HI>A righteous, a godly, a merciful a ju&s;t,</HI> or <HI>an upright man,</HI> often &s;ignifies <HI>a good man in ge|neral.</HI> And &s;o, when we are commanded to love or fear God, or to work righteou&s;ne&s;s, the meaning is not that we &s;hould practi&s;e only the particular duty men|tioned, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from others; but often, at lea&s;t, that we &s;hould become good men in general, and <HI>walk in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamele&s;s.</HI> And this is the &s;en&s;e which is &s;ometimes put upon the precept now under con&s;ideration. However it &s;eems plain, that this cannot be the true intention of it. For were it to be under&s;tood in this latitude, as injoining obedience to the commandments in general, it would in|clude in it the <HI>love of our neighbour,</HI> which is expre&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed, in this place, from the <HI>love of God.</HI> Here is plainly a compari&s;on made betwixt two command|ments, one of which is &s;aid to be <HI>the fir&s;t and great com|mandment,</HI> and the other to be <HI>like unto it.</HI> This, there|fore, which is &s;tiled <HI>the fir&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t be altogether di&s;tinct from that with which it is compared. Love is, indeed, the duty injoined in both; but the object of the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> is <HI>our Creator</HI> only; of the latter, only <HI>our fellow-creatures.</HI> This precept, therefore, does not include any of the du|ties of the <HI>&s;econd table</HI> of the moral law, as they are com|monly called. The mo&s;t it injoins, is, <HI>all</HI> the duties of the <HI>fir&s;t table,</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of the <HI>&s;econd.</HI> But, if I mi&s;take not, this command &s;till admits, and
<PB N="93" REF="006365_0096_1028AFCB18BD8AB8">
requires a farther <HI>limitation.</HI> It injoins certain di&s;po&s;i|tions and affections of the <HI>heart,</HI> towards God, as di&s;|tingui&s;hed from all <HI>external acts of devotion and religion;</HI> &s;uch as <HI>praying, offering &s;acrifices, fa&s;ting,</HI> ob&s;erving <HI>&s;abbaths</HI> and <HI>ordinances,</HI> &amp;c. The manner in which the precept is expre&s;&s;ed, &s;eems to &s;how, that the duty it in|joins is wholly <HI>internal&mdash;Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart;</HI> i. e. &s;incerely and unfeignedly&mdash;<HI>and with all thy &s;oul</HI>&mdash;in the exerci&s;e of thy under&s;tanding, and rational faculties&mdash;<HI>and with all thy mind</HI>&mdash;freely, voluntarily, without reluctance or con&s;traint. The&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions &s;eem to relate wholly to the mind. And that which determines this to be the true intention of the command, is what we find in the parallel place in another <HI>Evangeli&s;t.</HI> St. <HI>Mark</HI> relates the &s;tory of a per&s;on's com|ing to our Saviour with the &s;ame que&s;tion which is here an&s;wered; and the an&s;wer to it is in effect the &s;ame. Upon which the <HI>Scribe</HI> (as he is called in St. <HI>Mark</HI>) replied thus&mdash;<HI>Ma&s;ter, thou hast &s;aid the truth; for there is one God; and to love him with all the heart&mdash;is more than</HI> all whole burnt offerings and &s;acrifices&mdash;From this reply of the <HI>Scribe,</HI> it appears, that in propo&s;ing his que&s;tion ju&s;t before, he had a particular eye to the <HI>external</HI> &s;ervices required under the Law, compared with an <HI>in|ward</HI> regard to God, and &s;incere benevolence to man|kind: And that he accordingly under&s;tood our Lord in his an&s;wer, as making a di&s;tinction and compari&s;on, not only betwixt the duties of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;econd table;</HI> but al&s;o, betwixt the &s;everal duties of the <HI>fir&s;t table;</HI> and pre|ferring the <HI>internal</HI> love and reverence of God, <HI>to all burnt offerings and &s;acrifices;</HI> and con&s;equently, <HI>to all ex|ternal acts of piety and devotion,</HI> as injoined in the cere|monial law. This is plainly the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Scribe;</HI> and it is equally evident that our Lord approved his &s;en&s;e: For it follows immediately in the next ver&s;e&mdash;<HI>And when Je&s;us &s;aw that he an&s;wered di&s;cretely, he &s;aid unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</HI> I &s;hall, there|fore, take it for granted, or rather proved, That the pre|cept
<PB N="94" REF="006365_0097_1028B013B6AA27E8">
which our Lord calls the <HI>first and great command|ment,</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;hed not only from all the duties of the <HI>&s;econd table,</HI> but likewi&s;e from many of the fir&s;t; particularly, from all external acts of devotion; from all rites and ceremonies and legal in&s;titutions; and in &s;hort from all duties whatever, be&s;ides tho&s;e internal ones of the <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>affections;</HI> and of which God is the <HI>only</HI> and the <HI>immediate object.</HI> The duty here required, is wholly a <HI>&s;piritual &s;acrifice;</HI> and the <HI>heart</HI> is the only <HI>altar</HI> upon which it is to be <HI>offered.</HI> Accordingly, in the following di&s;cour&s;e, we &s;hall have no concern with any thing be&s;ides the inward &s;entiments of the heart; the di&s;po&s;itions and &s;allies of the &s;oul towards its Creator, the <HI>Father of &s;pirits.</HI> But let none think I am going to inculcate <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;peak of the <HI>religion</HI> and <HI>devotion</HI> of the <HI>heart.</HI> I propo&s;e to &s;peak of nothing but what has its foundation in &s;cripture, and the nature of things: Nor will any <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> be incouraged, be|&s;ides that which <HI>&s;ober rea&s;on</HI> requires.</P>
<P>WHAT then is it to <HI>love the Lord our God,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of the text? Or wherein does this duty con&s;i&s;t? I an&s;wer in general, That it con&s;i&s;ts in exerci&s;ing tho&s;e internal regards towards our Maker, which the perfections of his nature, and our relation to him require. And here I &s;hall not &s;pend time to prove, but take it for grant|ed, That God is infinite in <HI>power, knowledge</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s;</HI>&mdash;That he is able to perform whatever he plea|&s;es;&mdash;That he knows univer&s;ally what is wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t;&mdash;And that the moral rectitude of his nature is &s;uch, that his will and actions are always conformable to truth and right:&mdash;That as he created all things, &s;o he con&s;tantly upholds them, and governs them with per|fect wi&s;dom and equity, accommodating and attemper|ing his laws to the <HI>common good</HI> of his creatures&mdash;That as he is the <HI>father of all,</HI> &s;o his government is <HI>paternal,</HI> free from all unnece&s;&s;ary rigor;&mdash;uniform and &s;teady, in oppo&s;ition to all capriciou&s;ne&s;s and arbitrary proceedings;
<PB N="95" REF="006365_0098_1028AFCCC6BF62F0">
And <HI>finally,</HI> in the words of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> That he <HI>is good to all, and his tender mercies, over all his works.</HI></P>
<P>IT is &s;ufficient to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, ju&s;t to have hin|ted in this general way at the character and perfections of God: For it being &s;uppo&s;ed that he is really <HI>&s;uch a Being,</HI> it will not, perhaps, be very difficult to point out the principal of tho&s;e movements of mind, and internal regards, which are due to him: and &s;o to a&s;certain the nature of the duty under con&s;ideration. And I think the various things included in this important and com|prehen&s;ive duty of loving God, may not unfitly be re|duced to the following heads&mdash;<HI>Love, in a &s;trict restrained &s;en&s;e&mdash;Gratitude&mdash;De&s;ire of the divine approbation, and delight in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of it&mdash;Tru&s;t in, and dependence upon God&mdash;Ab&s;olute re&s;ignation of heart to his will</HI>&mdash;And la&s;tly, <HI>Joy in the con&s;ideration of our filial relation to him.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT I mentioned <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> was the <HI>love of God in the &s;trict re&s;trained &s;en&s;e of the word.</HI> By this I do not in|tend tho&s;e fla&s;hy and rapturous &s;allies of the heart to|wards God, which may proceed only from a fond conceit, that we are &s;ingled out to be the peculiar favourites of heaven. We may ea&s;ily fall into an exta&s;y, and run mad in religious contemplation, without having any thing of that divine love which is due to the perfecti|ons of our Creator. The love of God is a &s;teady, &s;o|ber, calm and rational thing, the re&s;ult of thought, and con&s;ideration&mdash;It is indeed a <HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> but a pa&s;&s;ion excited by rea&s;on pre&s;enting the proper object of it to the mind. Nor ought we to be &s;o &s;ollicitous about avoiding one extreme, as to fall into the contrary. We ought not to run &s;o far from <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> as to lo&s;e &s;ight of real devo|tion; we ought not to be &s;o fond of a <HI>rational religion,</HI> as to &s;uppo&s;e that religion con&s;i&s;ts wholly in cold dry &s;peculation, without having any concern with the <HI>affecti|ons.</HI> Real piety nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, that the heart is touched, affected, warmed, inflamed: and not barely
<PB N="96" REF="006365_0099_1028B049F8AE1608">
that we have right &s;peculative notions concerning God. A religion con&s;i&s;ting in nothing but a knowledge of God's attributes, and an external conduct agreeable to his laws, would be a lifele&s;s in&s;ipid thing: It would be neither a &s;ource of happine&s;s to our&s;elves nor recom|mend us to the approbation of him, who requires us to <HI>give him our heart.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED St. <HI>John</HI> &s;ays, That <HI>this is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments.</HI> But it is plain, both from the nature of the thing it&s;elf, and from the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle in this place, that his meaning is no more than this&mdash;That the <HI>natural effect</HI> or <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of love to God, is <HI>obedience to his commandments:</HI> And not &s;trictly &s;peaking, that keeping the commandments, is a proper definition of the love of God. The&s;e are evi|dently two di&s;tinct things; as di&s;tinct as love and obe|dience to any other being or per&s;on; or as any two things whatever. And how clo&s;e a connection &s;oever there may be betwixt them, they ought not to be con|founded. It is evident at fir&s;t view, that this com|mand, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind,</HI> carries in it &s;omething altogether different from an in|junction of <HI>external obedience.</HI> The precept relates to the heart and affections, as di&s;tingui&s;hed even from the un|der&s;tanding, whereby we di&s;cern and contemplate the di|vine perfections; and much more di&s;tinct from all ex|ternal actions of what kind &s;oever. Let any one &s;ee whether the following pa&s;&s;ages in the writings of the <HI>royal poet and prophet,</HI> do not carry in them the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of inward e&s;teem, approbation and love. <HI>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is nothing upon earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee. My fle&s;h and my heart faileth me; but God is the &s;trength of my heart, and my portion for ever. Like as the heart panteth after the water-brooks, &s;o longeth my &s;oul after thee, O God. My &s;oul is a thir&s;t for God; yea even for the living God.
<PB N="97" REF="006365_0100_1028B05979C31430">
When &s;hall I come and appear before him!</HI>&mdash;It is plain that this is the language not barely of <HI>rea&s;on;</HI> but of <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>fervour</HI> and <HI>emotion of &s;pirit.</HI> Nor can any tolerable account be given of the&s;e, and &s;uch like ex|pre&s;&s;ions in the devotional parts of &s;cripture, without &s;uppo&s;ing that the affections of tho&s;e who uttered them, were rai&s;ed to a great degree of warmth; and that they terminated in God him&s;elf, as their proper and ultimate object, without regard to any farther or future advantage: they terminated in him as their end, in much the &s;ame manner that our animal affections and appetites centre in their re&s;pective objects. Nor is there any thing that is ab&s;urd or romantic in this &s;uppo&s;ition; any thing that will not approve it&s;elf to our under&s;tandings upon the clo&s;e&s;t examination.</P>
<P>THERE is a natural di&s;tinction betwixt actions and characters, &s;ome being in them&s;elves morally good, and others evil. Mankind have faculties for di&s;cerning the&s;e moral differences: and what is in it&s;elf right and good, is al&s;o in it&s;elf amiable in the eye of every rational be|ing: it is in it&s;elf <HI>right</HI> to approve and love what is right, and <HI>wrong</HI> to approve and love what is wrong. Our Creator, be&s;ides endowing us with rea&s;on to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt moral good and evil, has moreover given us another faculty which is &s;ometimes called <HI>a moral &s;en&s;e;</HI> and which St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of under the titles of <HI>the law written in the heart,</HI> and <HI>the law of the mind.</HI> By virtue of this faculty, moral good and evil, when they are objects to our minds affect us in a very different manner; the fir&s;t affording us plea&s;ure, the other pain and unea&s;ine&s;s: And this, as unavoidably as the eye is differently affected with regular and irregular figures in the body; or the ear, with the mo&s;t grateful harmony, and the mo&s;t har&s;h and grating di&s;cord: I &s;ay <HI>as unavoidably;</HI> but neither of them are ab&s;olutely unavoidable.

&s;o there are &s;ome, perhaps, who have little or no <HI>ta&s;te</HI> in <HI>morals.</HI> However, as to the latter, this is not the natural &s;tate of their minds; but proceeds from their abu&s;ing and perverting <HI>nature.</HI> (And all our animal &s;en&s;es may be viciated al&s;o.)

None can avoid looking upon the <HI>former</HI> as the proper object of di&s;plea&s;ure, and upon the <HI>latter</HI> as the proper object of love and com|placency, although his own intere&s;t is no ways affected by the conduct of either.</P>
<P>BUT what relation, it may be a&s;ked, has all this di&s;|cour&s;e to do with the love of God? I an&s;wer, a very near relation: For God, according to the &s;uppo&s;ition mentioned above, is perfect in all tho&s;e moral qualities and excellencies which we e&s;teem amiable in mankind: and which if any man does not e&s;teem and admire and love, he is looked upon as a mon&s;ter, deba&s;ed below hu|manity,

and unworthy to be reckoned among rational creatures. Now if it be rea&s;onable to e&s;teem and love our fellow-men in proportion to their ju&s;tice, integrity and be|nevolence, mu&s;t not he who is perfect in all moral excel|lence be in proportion the proper object of tho&s;e &s;ame affections? The goodne&s;s of God &s;o far tran&s;cends that of the be&s;t of his creatures, that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour has told us, <HI>There is none good but one, that is God.</HI> The mo&s;t that any can pretend to without arrogating too much to them&s;elves, is a faint re&s;emblance of the divine per|fections. And can it be rea&s;onable to love and admire the mere portrait of moral excellence, and to let the &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;ource and &s;tandard of it, remain unre|garded. If goodne&s;s in a limited degree be worthy the e&s;teem of all rational beings, &s;hall not that goodne&s;s that is without bounds, and ab&s;olutely perfect, be thought worthy to excite in all, a real inward e&s;teem al&s;o? an hearty and &s;incere complacency? an ardent, inextingui&s;h|able love? <HI>A love &s;trong as death? A love which many waters cannot quench, nor the floods drown?</HI> In this there is no <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m:</HI> in this there is nothing unrea&s;onable and fanciful: For undoubtedly tho&s;e qualities which be|ing found in a limited degree, are really amiable, do not cea&s;e to be &s;o, when they become infinite; but in&s;tead of this, become <HI>infinitely</HI> amiable.</P>
<P>WERE it po&s;&s;ible for us to contemplate the divine perfections without con&s;idering <HI>our own</HI> relation to God; <HI>our own</HI> dependance upon him, and his providential care of <HI>us;</HI> could we con&s;ider him only as exerci&s;ing his moral perfections towards other beings with whom we have no concern, &s;till it would be rational to love and e&s;teem him. For the&s;e perfections are in them&s;elves amiable, and con&s;equently they are &s;o to all beings who are capable of di&s;cerning them. And we find our&s;elves in a manner nece&s;&s;itated to love tho&s;e virtuous characters which we meet with in hi&s;tory;&mdash;characters of men who lived in remote ages, and the di&s;tant parts of the
<PB N="100" REF="006365_0103_1028B0198EDBF480">
globe; although our own intere&s;t neither has, nor can be, any ways affected by their virtue. And thus al&s;o the moral perfections of God demand our love, &s;eparate from the con&s;ideration of our own particular relation to him. But when we con&s;ider him under the notion of being <HI>our</HI> Creator, <HI>our</HI> moral Governour, <HI>our</HI> Father, <HI>our</HI> Friend, <HI>our</HI> Patron; this brings the matter <HI>home to our&s;elves,</HI> and tends &s;till farther to endear him to us.</P>
<P>AND this naturally brings us to another of tho&s;e re|ligious regards which we owe immediately to God: I mean <HI>gratitude.</HI> This is nearly allied to the former; but intirely di&s;tinct from it. The love of God, in the mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e of it, is an inward e&s;teem, and de|lightful admiration of the divine perfections, without the con&s;ideration of any good we have either received or expect from them. But gratitude has re&s;pect to &s;ome|thing pa&s;t; 'tis a thankful &s;en&s;e and recognition of cer|tain benefits which we have actually received. And it is plain that if the moral attributes of God, are in them|&s;elves a proper object of love, their being exerted in po&s;itive acts of goodne&s;s and beneficence to us, calls for the returns of gratitude. Ingratitude is always looked upon as an indication of a ba&s;e, &s;ordid and degenerate mind: It is what we cannot avoid condemning in tho&s;e to whom we have &s;hown favour in any in&s;tance: we expect, at lea&s;t, that they &s;hould retain in their minds a &s;en&s;e of our munificence. All the world are agreed that this is what every man owes to his neighbour who has proved a benefactor to him. Why then &s;hould not the &s;ame temper of mind take place in us with relation of God? If we think our&s;elves obliged to thank our fellow men for tho&s;e incon&s;iderable favours, which they are &s;carce more than the <HI>in&s;truments</HI> of conveying to us, what degree of gratitude can be &s;ufficient for us to exerci&s;e towards our con&s;tant and <HI>infinite Benefactor?</HI> towards that Being to whom we are indebted for our exi&s;tence; for all the faculties of our minds and bodies? that Being who is

the <HI>original, voluntary</HI> be&s;tower of all that is valuable and dear to us? that Being from whom de&s;cends <HI>every good and every perfect gift?</HI> And as we are <HI>chri&s;tians,</HI> I may add, that Being who <HI>&s;o loved the world as to give his only begotten &s;on that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life?&mdash;What &s;hall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?

<P>BUT to proceed&mdash;Another branch of that religious temper of mind which is implied in the love of God, is a <HI>de&s;ire of his approbation and delight in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or the pro&s;pect of it.</HI> We de&s;ire to be thought favourably of, by mankind; and to be thought &s;o by the wi&s;e and good, yields no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to ingenuous and vir|tuous minds. But as God is the only perfect judge of real merit, to gain his approbation ought to be the highe&s;t ambition of every rea&s;onable creature. We are apt to lay traps and &s;nares to catch the fluttering applau&s;es of the multitude; and delight to be <HI>ho&s;anna'd</HI> by them. But are <HI>they</HI> the &s;upreme judges of what is really worthy of applau&s;e? Is it rea&s;onable to be &s;ollicitous about the &s;entiments of the world concerning us, and to take no thought about the approbation of the great <HI>In&s;pector</HI> and <HI>Cen&s;or</HI> of that world who&s;e e&s;teem we court? No man that has any ju&s;t conceptions of God's perfections can be regardle&s;s with what eye he views his conduct upon that &s;tage where his place of action is a&s;&s;igned him. God him&s;elf is a <HI>&s;pectator</HI> in this great <HI>theatre</HI> of the univer&s;e. A de&s;ire of his applau&s;e, therefore, and of the <HI>honour that comes from him,</HI> &s;hould in a manner exclude all lower ambition from our brea&s;ts. And the pro&s;pect of it mu&s;t afford the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction to every virtuous man, without the con&s;ideration of any reward con&s;equent there|upon.

<P>IN the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e we inquired into the na|ture and obligation of the love of God. The love of our neighbour is to be the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent. The precept injoining this duty, is thus expre&s;&s;ed in the text&mdash;<HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI> Now the general que&s;tion, What is implied in this precept, naturally re&s;olves it&s;elf into the&s;e three particulars and &s;ubordinate inquiries.</P>

<ITEM>1&s;t. WHO is here intended by our <HI>neighbour?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2ly. WHAT <HI>the love</HI> of our neighbour implies in it?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>AND, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> what is intended by our loving our neighbour <HI>as our&s;elves?</HI> A re&s;olution of the&s;e three par|ticular inquiries will give us a full idea of the nature and extent of the duty under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>1&s;t. THEN, who is intended by our <HI>neighbour?</HI> I an&s;wer, primarily and &s;trictly, tho&s;e who dwell <HI>near us;</HI> with whom it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed we have a frequent inter|cour&s;e;&mdash;and &s;o have more opportunities either to <HI>&s;erve</HI> or <HI>injure</HI> them, than we have to &s;erve or injure tho&s;e that are far &s;eparated from us. But the term al&s;o includes all tho&s;e with whom we have any thing to do&mdash;all who come within the reach of our abilities, &s;o that we can do them good either by communicating po&s;itive hap|pine&s;s of any kind to them, or by removing the cau&s;es of their mi&s;ery. Any per&s;on with whom we have any kind of intercour&s;e, whether he be one of our kindred or not; whether he be an acquaintance or a &s;tranger; whether he be a friend or an enemy; whether he pro|fe&s;s the &s;ame religion with our&s;elves, or a different one; whether he be in a private or a publick &s;tation; whether he be our own countryman, or a foreigner; let him be who he will, he is our neighbour in the &s;en&s;e of the text, when providence puts it in our power to relieve his wants, and render him happy. That this is the &s;en&s;e in which our Lord u&s;es the word <HI>neighbour,</HI> appears by St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account of what pa&s;&s;ed betwixt <HI>him</HI> and a cer|tain <HI>lawyer</HI> upon this &s;ame &s;ubject. Our Lord had told him that if he <HI>loved God with all his heart, and his neigh|bour as him&s;elf, he &s;hould live.</HI> Upon this the <HI>lawyer</HI> a&s;ked the que&s;tion which we are now endeavouring to an&s;wer&mdash;<HI>And who is my neighbour? Luke</HI> x. 29. Upon this our Lord relates a &s;tory concerning a <HI>Jew</HI> who fell into the mercile&s;s hands of robbers. He was found in
<PB N="113" REF="006365_0116_1028B06F78C53FB8">
the road by two travellers, a bigotted hard hearted <HI>prie&s;t,</HI> and a <HI>levite</HI> of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition. Neither of them afforded the pitiable object any relief, although he were one of their own nation and religion. But when a <HI>Sa|maritan,</HI> a man of another country, and a different re|ligion, a man who had <HI>le&s;s orthodoxy</HI> and <HI>more charity,</HI> than the other, found this unhappy &s;tranger, he had com|pa&s;&s;ion on him, and relieved him. <HI>Which now,</HI> &s;ays our Saviour, <HI>of the&s;e three was neighbour unto him that fell among thieves. And he &s;aid, he that &s;hewed mercy on him: Then &s;aid Je&s;us unto him, go thou and do likewi&s;e.</HI> Go thou, and act the &s;ame neighbourly part: Look upon thy &s;elf to be a neighbour to every man, and every man a neighbour to thee, who has any wants and calamities to recommend him to thee. Think not that thou di&s;|charge&s;t the duty of loving thy neighbour, by returning the kind offices of thy friends; by doing good to thy acquaintance; to thy country-men; to tho&s;e of thine own &s;ect in religion; but extend thy friend&s;hip to all whom thou art capable of &s;erving.</P>
<P>FROM this piece of hi&s;tory, or this <HI>moral fable,</HI> (call it which you plea&s;e) it appears, in general, that the charity which is injoined in revelation, is infinitely more noble, generous and di&s;intere&s;ted than the <HI>love of our country,</HI> as &s;uch, &s;o much extolled by &s;ome dei&s;tical writers: And than that <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> which is recommended by wri|ters of the &s;ame &s;tamp&mdash;A friend&s;hip confined to a particular knot of men, whom humour or intere&s;t, or perhaps only a &s;imilitude of vices, has tied and united together. To be a friend in the u&s;ual &s;en&s;e of the word, is to act a kind part to &s;ome one, or more particular per&s;ons; but to love our neighbour, in the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, is to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ve the world; and to be <HI>that</HI> to <HI>all</HI> with whom we have any concern, which friend&s;hip is to <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two.</HI></P>

LEST we &s;hould take up a notion that the proper objects of our love were our friends, our kindred, tho&s;e of our own party, or our country only, our ble&s;&s;ed &s;aviour took care particularly to enjoin upon his di&s;ciples the love of their <HI>enemies,</HI> after his own example, who died for us while we were <HI>enemies in our minds by wicked works;</HI> and after the example of <HI>his God and our God; his Father and our Father, who maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good, and &s;endeth rain on the ju&s;t, and on the unju&s;t</HI> Our <HI>enemies</HI> are included in the general term <HI>neighbour;</HI> but it was highly proper and nece&s;&s;ary that <HI>they</HI> &s;hould be particularly, and expre&s;ly pointed out to the <HI>Jews,</HI> becau&s;e they were generally &s;uch blind, narrow-hearted bigots, that they looked upon all the world be&s;ides their own nation, to be the proper objects of their contempt and hatred. This national hardne&s;s and &s;tingine&s;s of &s;oul, was continually increa&s;ed by the influence of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who, like too many modern teachers and doctors, in&s;tead of inculcating the great duty of univer&s;al charity, expended their zeal upon frivolous matters; and laboured more abundantly to make the populace adore them&s;elves; and to rai&s;e their in|dignation again&s;t all &s;uch as dared to &s;ay any thing again&s;t their <HI>old traditions,</HI> or <HI>new whims, by which they made void the law of God.</HI> And that which made it nece&s;&s;ary for our Saviour particularly to recommend to his hearers the love of their enemies, makes it proper for every other preacher to do the &s;ame, where bigotry and a party &s;pirit prevails; and would to God, that there were not enough of this wretched &s;pirit to be &s;een in our own land, at the pre&s;ent day, to make the &s;ame thing nece&s;&s;ary now!</P>
<P>HAVING thus con&s;idered the <HI>object</HI> and <HI>extent</HI> of the love recommended in the text; we proceed to inquire,</P>
<P>2ly. INTO the <HI>nature</HI> of the thing it&s;elf. What then is implied in the <HI>love</HI> of our neighbour? I an&s;wer, it is
<PB N="115" REF="006365_0118_1028B0722FBF8A90">
the &s;ame thing with benevolence, good-will, or charity; a di&s;po&s;ition to do good and communicate happine&s;s. The &s;ame word that is u&s;ed in the text to expre&s;s that temper of mind which becomes us towards our Maker, is u&s;ed al&s;o to expre&s;s the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of heart which is required towards our neighbour. Both are expre&s;&s;ed by the word <HI>love&mdash;Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart&mdash;and thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI> However, although the words are the &s;ame, the things intended by them are very different; as different as the objects of this love. When it is referred to God, no one imagines it means benevolence, or wi&s;hing well, or doing good to our Creator; but e&s;teem, complacency, admiration, reverence, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the like. The rea&s;on of the thing, con&s;idering God's independency, power and wi&s;dom and moral perfections, and our own relation to him, plainly points out the&s;e to be the things intended, when we are commanded to love <HI>him.</HI> And it is equally plain that when our neighbour is propo&s;ed to us as the object of our love, it cannot intend that we &s;hould pay him that &s;ame internal reverence, honour, re&s;ignation, &amp;c. which we pay to our Maker. This would be <HI>idolatry</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>charity.</HI> So far as our neigh|bours re&s;emble God, &s;o far indeed they are proper objects of the &s;ame kind of internal regards which we owe to him: And it is doubtle&s;s our duty to e&s;teem, and rever|ence them in proportion to their real greatne&s;s and merit. For God requires us to <HI>give honour to whom honour is due.</HI> However, this is not what is primarily or princi|pally intended by the love of our neighbour. This is a duty which we owe to all in common, with whom we have any concern; too many of whom have little or nothing in them that renders them the proper objects of delight, complacency, e&s;teem and reverence. Nor can they be all in common the object of any other pa&s;&s;ion be&s;ides that of benevolence or good will: This, there|fore, is what the precept in the text injoins upon us. And our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour plainly leads us to this general idea
<PB N="116" REF="006365_0119_1028B02EAC26AC60">
of the duty, in his di&s;cour&s;e with the lawyer before re|ferred to, <HI>Luke</HI> 10. When the <HI>lawyer</HI> a&s;ked, who was in|tended by his neighbour whom he was to love as him&s;elf, our Lord told him the &s;tory of the <HI>Jew</HI> who was neg|lected in his mi&s;ery by the <HI>prie&s;t</HI> and <HI>levite;</HI> and kindly relieved by the <HI>&s;chi&s;matical Samaritan</HI>&mdash;and then ad|ded, <HI>Go thou, and do likewi&s;e.</HI> This &s;hows that the primary and mo&s;t proper notion of the love of our neighbour, which he had ju&s;t before recommended, is a kind and charitable di&s;po&s;ition. It al&s;o &s;hows farther, that the love of our neighbour, as the word is u&s;ed by our Saviour, is not re&s;trained to the heart and affections, in the &s;ame manner with the love of God: but is u&s;ed in &s;uch a large complex &s;en&s;e as to include be|nevolent <HI>action</HI> as well as benevolence of <HI>mind.</HI>&mdash;"Go thou, and <HI>do likewi&s;e.</HI>" As the natural, and perhaps unavoidable, con&s;equence of God's being good, is his doing to his creatures; &s;o there is a clo&s;e connexion betwixt the&s;e, in all other beings. We cannot conceive of a man's being truly charitable in his heart towards his neighbour, without doing good to him al&s;o, when it is in his power, and the pro|per occa&s;ions pre&s;ent for calling forth this internal prin|ciple into action. What a man really wills and wi&s;hes in his heart, he effects al&s;o, when it does not exceed his abilities. So that benevolent action will always be in proportion to the &s;trength of the benevolent principle, allowing for the different powers, talents, and opportuni|ties for doing good, which take place in the world. This I take to be the intention of St. <HI>John,</HI> in his 1 Epi&s;. chap. 3d. ver. 7. <HI>Little children let no man deceive you: be that doth righteou&s;ne&s;s, is righteous, even as he is righ|teous.</HI> He that acts well, is really good to the degree that he acts well; and he doth righteou&s;ne&s;s in proportion to the righteous principle in his heart: the&s;e things keep pace, and the one is always the mea&s;ure and &s;tandard of the other.</P>

LOVE is, in its own nature, an active and vigorous principle. This godlike gue&s;t, does not lie dozing in that brea&s;t where it takes up its abode, and conceal it&s;elf from the ob&s;ervation of mankind, like ea&s;tern monarchs in their palaces. Its <HI>light &s;hines before men, and they &s;ee its good works.</HI> It is con&s;tantly exerting it&s;elf for the benefit of tho&s;e we love: The charitable man <HI>loves not in word and in tongue</HI> only, <HI>but indeed and in truth.</HI> Cha|rity contents not it&s;elf with good wi&s;hes; with kind &s;peeches, and a courtly addre&s;s; but does &s;ub&s;tantial acts of beneficence, according to the exigences of our neighbours, and our own abilities. It contents not it&s;elf, with &s;aying to the naked <HI>be ye clothed;</HI> and to the hungry, <HI>be ye filled;</HI> but admini&s;ters to their nece&s;&s;ities. Love is infinite and the methods of its acting various, and innu|merable. It originates in the heart, and from thence points every way, like various lines drawn from the centre of a circle, or rays i&s;&s;uing from the &s;un. It &s;hines with its benign influence upon all that come in its way. It is <HI>eyes to the blind; and feet to the lame;</HI> it draws upon it the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing of him that is ready to peri&s;h, and cau&s;es the widows heart to &s;ing for Joy.</HI> It is in&s;truction to the ig|norant; and con&s;olation to the &s;orrowful; it is a timely redre&s;s to the injured and oppre&s;&s;ed; and liberty to the captive. <HI>Charity &s;uffereth long and is kind; charity en|vieth not; charity vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly; &s;eeketh not her own; is not ea&s;ily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth: Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</HI></P>

the faults and follies that are to be &s;een in the world, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the love of truth and virtue and piety: It is a calm and unruffled &s;elf-enjoyment; a com|po&s;ed temper of &s;oul, amid&s;t all the tumults and di&s;or|ders of the world. Thus comprehen&s;ive is the duty of charity, or the love of our neighbour, in the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e of it; neither indeed, have we yet carried it to its full extent. Charity, con&s;idered in its greate&s;t latitude, comprehends in it all moral and &s;ocial virtues. He that is a real lover of mankind will, from this &s;imple uniform principle, practice all tho&s;e virtues upon which the good order and happine&s;s of the world depends: Benevolence naturally and nece&s;&s;arily leads to this; i. e. to the prac|tice of every virtue without exception. For there is not any particular one that can be omitted, nor any vice that can be indulged, without detriment to the world. The connexion betwixt the practice of all moral virtues, and publick happine&s;s, is clo&s;e and intimate: Nor are tho&s;e more private virtues that fall under the denomination of <HI>temperance,</HI> exceptions to this general a&s;&s;ertion. It would take us too long a time to &s;how how all particular vir|tues, (or if you plea&s;e <HI>chri&s;tian graces</HI>) that re&s;pect either our&s;elves or our neighbour, may be derived from this one &s;ource of benevolence: But St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s authority will be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the a&s;&s;ertion, without any far|ther proof. <HI>He that loveth another,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>hath fulfilled the law: For this, Thou &s;halt not commit adultery; thou &s;halt not &s;teal; thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s; thou &s;halt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, namely, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfil|ling of the law.</HI> And for this rea&s;on the &s;ame apo&s;tle calls charity by that emphatical name&mdash;<HI>The bond of perfectne&s;s,</HI> Col. i 14&mdash;The <HI>tie</HI> and <HI>nexus,</HI> the common &s;ource and fountain of all moral perfections and excel|lencies: From that they all flow, and into that they may all be re&s;olved again: As benevolence in the &s;upreme

Father and Lord of all things compri&s;es in it all the moral perfections of God: And as that &s;imple principle, under the direction of infinite wi&s;dom, exerting it&s;elf in a variety of ways, in order to accompli&s;h the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good in the whole, receives the various denomi|nations of <HI>goodne&s;s, grace, mercy, forbearance, ju&s;tice</HI> &amp;c. &s;o all particular &s;ocial virtues, may be only the various <HI>modifications</HI> of charity, exerted into action.</P>
<P>WHEN we are &s;peaking of the virtue of charity in mankind, it &s;hould always be remembered that we are not &s;peaking of a blind impul&s;e or in&s;tinct; a &s;ort of mad&mdash;good nature, that diffu&s;es it&s;elf abroad without prudence, fore thought or di&s;cretion; but of the bene|volence of rational beings towards their fellow-creatures; which &s;uppo&s;es, that benevolence is always under the direction of rea&s;on, pointing out to it the ways in which it is to exert it&s;elf, and the channels in which it ought to flow. Simple benevolence, not directed by know|ledge, would be only a <HI>loving, kind</HI> &s;ort of <HI>phrenzy</HI> or <HI>di&s;traction,</HI> which it is probable might do as much hurt as good. For a being without rea&s;on to govern his ac|tions by, would be as likely to do wrong as right; to make the object of his kindne&s;s mi&s;erable, as happy. But he that is wi&s;e as well as benevolent, will ob&s;erve tho&s;e methods of acting, which are the mo&s;t conducive to happine&s;s; that is, he will u&s;e the mo&s;t effectual <HI>means</HI> to bring about his <HI>end.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is no conceiveable goodne&s;s or evil in the actions of an intelligent creature, but as they conduce to &s;ome good or bad end. And &s;ince happine&s;s, in a large &s;en&s;e of the word, is the only good end, the only thing that is valuable for its own &s;ake, it follows that an action is &s;o far good, and no farther, than it produces happine&s;s: And this is the general rule which we ought to govern our&s;elves by in our intercour&s;e with the world. To do good is what we &s;hould aim at. But then there are
<PB N="121" REF="006365_0124_1028B0794F94A5C0">
other particular, and &s;ubordinate rules of conduct, flowing from this general one, which ought to be the more <HI>im|mediate regulators</HI> of our actions, in order to our doing the greate&s;t good we are capable of; &s;uch as adhering to <HI>truth, ju&s;tice;</HI> doing good to a <HI>benefactor</HI> rather than to another; providing for our <HI>own families</HI> and <HI>kindred</HI> rather than for others; and the like: For there are cer|tain peculiar ties and relations, which make it rea&s;onable to give the preference to &s;ome in our kind offices, rather than to others. And this is &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with univer&s;al charity, that it is upon the whole mo&s;t advantageous to the world. Our benevolence would be too vague, and diffu&s;e; it would be in danger of evaporat|ing without doing much &s;ervice to any, had not the wi&s;e author of our nature by the con&s;titution he has given us, and certain particular affections, pointed it to &s;ome <HI>particular objects more e&s;pecially.</HI> In general our kindred demand our fir&s;t concern; our other friends and bene|factors the next; tho&s;e of our neighbourhood the next&mdash;and &s;o on to our country, our nation; and from our own nation, to all others. This &s;eems to be the order which God and nature have pointed out to us; and if &s;o, then to ob&s;erve it, and to ari&s;e in our good-will by tho&s;e <HI>gradations,</HI> mu&s;t certainly be the mo&s;t conducive to the general happine&s;s of mankind; for the order e&s;tabli&s;hed by God can never thwart, or interfere with, the good of his creatures. To break in upon the <HI>order of nature,</HI> or to act out of our <HI>proper &s;phere,</HI> can never i&s;&s;ue in greater happine&s;s to our&s;elves or others, than keeping &s;trictly to <HI>both.</HI> And the method of being &s;erviceable to mankind, whatever our &s;tation, and circum&s;tances in life are, is ordinarily plain enough to tho&s;e who have any real inclination to follow it. But I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to the third and la&s;t inquiry under this head, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>3ly. WHAT is intended by our loving our neighbour <HI>as our&s;elves?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="006365_0125_1028B036398F5A00">
IT has been ob&s;erved<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol's</HI> &s;ermon on this &s;ubject.</NOTE> by &s;ome, That this expre&s;&s;ion is capable of three different &s;en&s;es&mdash;It may intend that we &s;hould love our neighbour with <HI>as great a degree of inten&s;ene&s;s</HI> as we do our&s;elves: and be as &s;ollicitous about his happine&s;s as about our own. This would indeed be a glorious temper of mind. But it may be rea&s;onably que&s;tioned whether it is po&s;&s;ible for mankind in this world, or perhaps in any other, to be &s;o benevolent, as not to have a peculiar feeling for them&s;elves. And as the po&s;&s;ibility of this may be que&s;tioned, it may, in the &s;ame degree, be que&s;tioned whether this is the true in|tention of the precept. For all God's commands are adapted to our &s;tate, circum&s;tances and capacities. Again, the precept may intend that we &s;hould have a love to our neighbour <HI>of the &s;ame kind</HI> with that which we bear to our&s;elves: i. e. that as we are all naturally concerned for our own welfare, &s;o we &s;hould al&s;o have <HI>a real concern,</HI> in &s;ome degree for the welfare of others. But this in|terpretation &s;eems to be as much too low and jejune, as that above mentioned was too &s;ublime and elevated. For a man may have a real love to mankind in this &s;en&s;e, and yet be a wicked, and unju&s;t man, by rea&s;on that his benevolence is not &s;trong enough to be a balance for his principle of &s;elf-love. All men have doubtle&s;s &s;ome degree of real benevolence; but a regard to their own private good may be &s;o &s;trong as to counter-act and defeat it; and &s;o lead them habitually to the mo&s;t cruel and inhuman practices.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, that we pitch upon &s;ome third way of interpreting the precept before us. And perhaps the &s;en&s;e of it may be this&mdash;That we &s;hould not barely love our neighbour; but that our love to him <HI>bear &s;ome certain proportion</HI> to our &s;elf-love; that we love him to &s;uch a degree, as &s;hall prevent us from do|ing any injury to him for the &s;ake of private intere&s;t;
<PB N="123" REF="006365_0126_1028B07C04A6F2D0">
that in all our intercour&s;e with him, we &s;hould <HI>do to him, as we would that he &s;hould do to us.</HI> More cannot be well intended in the precept; and it is certain that le&s;s cannot. And &s;uch a love to our neighbour as this, does not only imply that we ab&s;tain from all acts of inju&s;tice towards him; but al&s;o that we are active in &s;erving him when he &s;tands in need of our a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for certainly this is what we &s;hould expect of him. It is impo&s;&s;ible exactly to determine <HI>how far</HI> we ought to go in acts of beneficence to our neighbour; but certainly &s;omething is ju&s;tly expected of us, be&s;ides <HI>not injuring</HI> him. I &s;hall beg leave to u&s;e the words of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> upon this &s;ubject, who &s;eems to prefer the la&s;t mentioned &s;en&s;e of the words. <Q>Both our nature and condition, &s;ays he, require that each particular man &s;hould make particular provi&s;ion for him&s;elf: And the inquiry what proportion benevolence &s;hould have to &s;elf-love, when brought down to practice, will be, what is a competent care and provi&s;ion for our|&s;elves. And how certain &s;oever it be, that each man mu&s;t determine this for him&s;elf; and how ridiculous &s;oever it would be for any to attempt to determine it for another; yet it is to be ob&s;erved that the pro|portion is real; and that a competent provi&s;ion has a bound; and that it cannot be all which we can po&s;|&s;ibly get, and keep within our gra&s;p, without legal in|ju&s;tice. Mankind almo&s;t univer&s;ally bring in vanity, &s;upplies for what is called a life of plea&s;ure, covetou&s;|ne&s;s, or imaginary notions of &s;uperiority over others, to determine this que&s;tion: But every one who de&s;ires to act a proper part in &s;ociety, would do well to de|termine how far any of them come in to determine it in a way of moral con&s;ideration. All that can be &s;aid is, &s;uppo&s;ing, what as the world goes is &s;o much to be &s;uppo&s;ed that 'tis &s;carce to be mentioned, that per&s;ons do not neglect what they really owe to them|&s;elves; the more of their care and thought, and of their fortune they employ in doing good to their fel|low

<P>WE have now done with the three inquiries which we propo&s;ed to an&s;wer&mdash;Who is our <HI>neighbour?</HI> what is it <HI>to love</HI> our neighbour? what is it to love him <HI>as our|&s;elves?</HI> We &s;hall conclude the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e with a few words concerning our obligation to the duty, the nature of which we have been con&s;idering.

No man wants, that any one &s;hould point out the particular grounds of the obligation that others are under to love and a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>him.</HI> Every man naturally and unavoid|ably expects, and thinks he has a right to expect, kind u&s;age from tho&s;e about him. But will any man be &s;o vain as to imagine that him&s;elf is the only per&s;on in the world that has any title to &s;uch treatment? Can he, if he tries, per&s;wade him&s;elf, that all are obliged to love and do good to him, according to <HI>their</HI> abilities, and <HI>his own</HI> wants; and yet that he is under obligation to none? No man can &s;eriou&s;ly believe this, 'till <HI>the light that is in him is become darkne&s;s.</HI> Let us deal fairly with our&s;elves: Let the &s;ame rea&s;on, whatever it be, that &s;a|tisfies us, that others ought not to injure us, but to be beneficent and humane to us, &s;atisfy us al&s;o, that we ought not to be injurious to them, but &s;tudious of their happine&s;s. Happine&s;s is what each man de&s;ires for him&s;elf as a real good; and he cannot be ignorant that others de&s;ire it al&s;o, and have a right to expect it upon the &s;ame terms with him&s;elf. Either no one had a right to expect kindne&s;s, candour and good will; or all men have the &s;ame. And then mutual benevolence, and an intercour&s;e of good offices, ought to take place in the world univer&s;ally.&mdash;But</P>

2ly. GOD has required us to be benevolent, and friendly to each other. He that commands us to love him&s;elf with all our heart, commands us al&s;o to love our neighbour as our&s;elves. And the will or law of a per|fect Being, a Being who is in all re&s;pects fit to be obeyed, is what con&s;titutes obligation in the primary and mo&s;t formal notion of obligation. We cannot properly be &s;aid to be under obligation, but <HI>to &s;ome Being,</HI> who has a right to give us law; and the more perfect that right is, the &s;tronger is our obligation. But</P>
<P>3ly. To inquire why we are obliged to be beneficent ju&s;t and charitable, is to inquire why we are obliged to be morally good; a que&s;tion that &s;eems to carry its own an&s;wer with it&mdash;To &s;uppo&s;e there is &s;uch a thing as moral goodne&s;s and excellence, is to &s;uppo&s;e that all ra|tional beings are under obligation to conform to the rules of it. It is a contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e that any parti|cular temper, or cour&s;e of action is <HI>right,</HI> and yet that it may be right for us <HI>to deviate</HI> from it. It is eternally right to conform to what is right: Nor need we look out for any farther obligation after we are &s;atisfied that a thing is really right: This of it&s;elf &s;uppo&s;es we are un|der obligation to do it; and that we cannot do the con|trary without acting a wrong and unrea&s;onable part.</P>
<P>4ly THE nearer we conform to the great law of be|nevolence, the nearer we conform to the perfections of the Deity. God is infinite in goodne&s;s. In this the moral perfection of the divine nature con&s;i&s;ts. And if this be what renders God perfect, it mu&s;t in proportion render us perfect al&s;o. And &s;o far as we fall &s;hort of it, &s;o far we fall &s;hort of perfection.</P>
<P>5ly. THE order and the common good of the world evidently depend upon the exerci&s;e of mutual benevolence. From what proceed the tumults and principal calamities that are daily &s;een in the world, but from a neglect of
<PB N="126" REF="006365_0129_1028B03BCB9EB370">
this duty, and from the indulgence of a narrow &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit? Were men to <HI>put on, as the elect of God, bowels of love and compa&s;&s;ion;</HI> did they feel for others as well as them&s;elves; we &s;hould no more hear of &s;trife and de|bate betwixt private families; there would be no longer tho&s;e contentions and animo&s;ities that di&s;turb the peace either of church or &s;tate: We &s;hould no longer hear of the tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion of princes; or the envy and rebellion of &s;ubjects; we &s;hould hear no more of <HI>wars and rumours of wars;</HI> of fields drunk with human gore, and <HI>garments rolled in blood;</HI> we &s;hould hear no more of cities &s;tormed; countries laid de&s;olate; men devour|ed by their fellow-men; or carried into inglorious cap|tivity and &s;lavery; but all the world would be hu&s;hed into peace, <HI>every one &s;itting &s;ecurely under his own vine, and under his own fig-tree.</HI> It is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, prevailing over charity and humanity, that has &s;pread de&s;truction and de&s;olation through the world; that has depopulat|ed the earth; that has turned the whole ocean into a <HI>red &s;ea;</HI> and the whole world into <HI>Golgotha</HI> and <HI>Aceldema, the place of a &s;kull,</HI> and a <HI>field of blood.</HI></P>
<P>The con&s;titution of the world is &s;uch, that plenty, peace and happine&s;s can prevail no farther than a foun|dation is laid for them in mutual benevolence, and an exchange of good offices. Love is the &s;pirit that ce|ments mankind together; and pre&s;erves that order and harmony among&s;t them, which is requi&s;ite in order to the general &s;afety and welfare; ju&s;t as the regular mo|tions and harmony of the heavenly bodies depend upon their mutual gravitation towards each other: Let this catholic and univer&s;al principle be once de&s;troyed, and confu&s;ion, di&s;cord, and the cru&s;h of worlds inevitably follow: And di&s;orders &s;imilar to the&s;e unavoidably &s;uc|ceed in the moral world, upon the neglect of tho&s;e &s;o|cial duties that have their foundation in love.</P>

IT is this divine principle that makes a good king; a good &s;ubject; a good ma&s;ter, and a good &s;ervant. This is &s;uch a temper of mind as would lead every man to fill up his own particular &s;tation in life with honour to him&s;elf; and &s;o as to contribute to the general happine&s;s of mankind; it would &s;weeten the nau&s;eous draught of life, and make us all pa&s;s the days of our pilgrimage in this world with plea&s;ure; it would &s;pread joy through out the earth. How glorious would it be if that time &s;hould come, that every man was &s;ure, that he &s;aw <HI>his friend</HI> every time he &s;aw <HI>his neighbour!</HI> Would men take as much pains to do good, as they do to afflict and grieve and devour one another, the &s;ociety of men on earth would re&s;emble that of angels in heaven: But as things generally are, there is &s;o much &s;trife and envy, and malice, and revenge, that a good man is &s;ick of the world: And is ready to cry out with the prophet, <HI>Oh that I had wings like a dove; for then would I fly away and be at re&s;t.</HI> But</P>
<P>6ly. AN argument for charity may be taken from &s;elf-love. That which tends to publick good, tends to private good al&s;o. To &s;uppo&s;e the contrary is a manife&s;t contradiction. For <HI>publick</HI> happine&s;s is increa&s;ed no far|ther than the happine&s;s of <HI>individuals</HI> is &s;o. The temper of love is in it&s;elf, the temper of happine&s;s, and &s;erene, &s;elf-enjoyment: And if the world be under the govern|ment of a righteous and wi&s;e providence, tho&s;e mu&s;t, in the final re&s;ult of things, be found be&s;t to have con&s;ult|ed their own intere&s;t, who have been the mo&s;t indu&s;trious to advance the happine&s;s of others. Wherefore, let the&s;e con&s;iderations laid together excite us to put on the divine temper of love. That charity which rea&s;on dic|tates, is &s;o far from being the love of any &s;ect or party of men, that it ought not to be confined even to the whole human &s;pecies. It ought to extend to every order of beings that is capable of happine&s;s. There are none &s;o high and &s;o much above us, as not to have a ju&s;t claim
<PB N="128" REF="006365_0131_1028B04019F41AA0">
to it; none &s;o low and de&s;picable as not to de&s;erve our kind regards. The rea&s;on why we are not commanded to extend our love to the angels, and all the glorious inhabitants of the other world, is not becau&s;e they are a different order of beings; but becau&s;e they are out of the reach of our abilities; becau&s;e their happine&s;s is not placed in our power, like that of our neighbour. And as to the lower animal world, it is as truly a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the laws of benevolence and humanity to put them to mi&s;ery out of mere wantonne&s;s, and when no good end can be an&s;wered by it, as it is groundle&s;ly to afflict our fellow men. Nothing ought to be below our no|tice, that is not &s;o low in the &s;cale of being, as to be ex|empted from pain, and incapable of happiness. The lower animals are not; and <HI>Solomon</HI> makes it one part of the character of <HI>a righteous man,</HI> that he <HI>regardeth the life of his bea&s;t.</HI> They are all, in a good &s;en&s;e, <HI>the offspring of God:</HI> God is the common parent to us and them: And we may &s;ay&punc; without a metaphor, even to the worm, <HI>Thou art my &s;i&s;ter.</HI> Although we may be apt to think that our great &s;uperiority to the other inhabitants of this earth, &s;ets us above an obligation to regard their happine&s;s; yet God had a particular regard to them in the in&s;titution of the <HI>&s;abbath;</HI> he even <HI>heareth the young ravens when they cry; and not a &s;parrow falleth to the ground without him.</HI> If we would avoid a narrow, &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, we &s;hould con&s;ider the whole univer&s;e as one magnificent building, with different apartments for different inhabitants, all &s;ubjects of the &s;ame King, and children of the &s;ame Father, who&s;e general law is bene|volence and kindne&s;s. <HI>Him</HI> we &s;hould con&s;ider as &s;itting upon <HI>the circuit of heaven,</HI> and &s;aying with a loud voice to <HI>all,</HI> what St. <HI>John</HI> &s;aid only to a <HI>few&mdash;My children!

<P>THIS earth, where mankind have their re&s;idence, bears but a &s;mall proportion to the univer&s;e. And this earth is again divided into different countries and na|tions;

the&s;e countries and nations, into different cities and towns; into di&s;tinct &s;ocieties and corporations and families. This is nece&s;&s;ary and convenient; and every one ought to be principally concerned for the welfare of tho&s;e to whom he is the mo&s;t nearly allied. But he ought not to let any <HI>part</HI> ingro&s;s <HI>the whole</HI> of his bene|volence. As a man's belonging to a particular family, does not de&s;troy his relation to the whole common|wealth of which he is a member; &s;o his particular re|lation to one political or civil &s;ociety, does not de&s;troy his relation to the greater &s;ociety of mankind in general; not this, his relation to the whole rational creation. He that &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;iders him&s;elf in this light, as a member and part of one &s;tupendous whole, will find little need of any farther arguments to convince him of the folly of being &s;elfi&s;h, and contracted: He will be a&s;hamed of any thing that looks like a <HI>party &s;pirit:</HI> A vitious &s;elf-love will naturally be weakened in him: Benevo|lence will &s;pring up in his heart; it will diffu&s;e it&s;elf like light from the &s;un; it will &s;pread from kindred to a country; from a country to a kingdom; and from one kingdom to another, till it reach not only all the inhabi|tants of this little &s;pot of ground called <HI>the earth,</HI> but till it gra&s;p the univer&s;e; and then a man bears the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to that <HI>one God and Father of all,</HI> who <HI>is good to all, and who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works.</HI></P>
<P>SPECULATIONS of this kind may &s;ometimes be of &s;ervice to us, in order to open and enlarge our hearts: But our <HI>proper bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> lies chiefly much <HI>nearer home.</HI> It is our <HI>neighbour</HI> that we are more immediately con|cerned with; it is him that we are commanded to love as we do our&s;elves; and if we comply with this precept, according to its true intention, we cannot be deficient in our kind regards to tho&s;e that are more remote from us. Benevolence and charity will be the general turn and bent of our mind; and will naturally be felt towards all beings when they pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our thoughts.

WE may ob&s;erve, that this a&s;&s;ertion of our Lord con|tains an expre&s;s and po&s;itive an&s;wer to the que&s;tion pro|po&s;ed ju&s;t before by the <HI>lawyer.</HI> It &s;eems that the <HI>Jews</HI> (as was ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject) were not agreed among&s;t them&s;elves which command|ment in the law [of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>] was the greate&s;t, or mo&s;t important. Some pitched upon <HI>that</HI> relating to <HI>circum|ci&s;ion;</HI> others <HI>that</HI> concerning the ob&s;ervation of the <HI>&s;abbath;</HI> and &s;o on. Now it was a re&s;olu|tion of this point, which the <HI>lawyer,</HI> in his query, de&s;ired of our Lord. And con&s;equently, the &s;en&s;e of our Lord's an&s;wer will be this&mdash;<Q>In making a <HI>compari&s;on</HI> be|twixt the various precepts of the <HI>mo&s;aic in&s;titution,</HI> the <HI>pre-eminence</HI> ought to be given to that which re&s;pects the love of God; this is the <HI>principal,</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>important</HI> and <HI>fundamental</HI> of all duties; and which, therefore, demands your <HI>chief</HI> care and at|tention.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is the purport of our Lord's an&s;wer. Now the inquiry which naturally ari&s;es here, is, What is the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>ground</HI> of this preference? Or, upon what account does our Lord &s;tile this, the fir&s;t and great com|mandment? The rea&s;on is too obvious to need mention|ing, why the pre-eminence or fir&s;t place &s;hould be given to this commandment, had the competition been only betwixt the internal love and reverence of the one true God, and the <HI>rituals</HI> of religion ordained in the cere|monial law. But it appears that the compari&s;on is made betwixt all the commandments in general, <HI>moral</HI> as well as <HI>ritual.</HI> And that which may &s;eem &s;trange to &s;ome, is, That the love of <HI>God</HI> &s;hould be looked upon as of more importance than the love of our <HI>neighbour.</HI> As <HI>God is not</HI> externally <HI>wor&s;hipped of men's hands, as though he needed any thing;</HI> &s;o neither can our loving him <HI>with all our heart,</HI> be any advantage to him, he being ab&s;o|lutely independent. But our righteou&s;ne&s;s and charity may profit men like our&s;elves: our neighbour may be
<PB N="133" REF="006365_0136_1028B08B281C3040">
really benefited by our love and good offices. And as we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>end</HI> of all God's command|ments, mu&s;t be the advancement of the happine&s;s of his creatures, and not his own, &s;o one might po&s;&s;ibly think that tho&s;e commandments &s;hould be e&s;teemed the mo&s;t important, and claim our primary regard, in which the good of mankind is the mo&s;t immediately concerned, &s;uch as ju&s;tice, charity, and, in &s;hort all tho&s;e particular duties which are comprehended in the general one of love towards our neighbour. It might, therefore have been expected, that our Lord's an&s;wer &s;hould have run thus&mdash;<HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf; this is the fir&s;t and great commandment.</HI> But we find, on the contrary, that he has a&s;&s;igned only the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place to this duty, and re&s;erved the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> for the love of God. Now if this &s;hould appear a difficulty to any, as pro|bably it does, the difficulty may, po&s;&s;ibly be removed by the following con&s;iderations, which I &s;hall &s;carce have more than time enough to mention.</P>
<P N="1">1. IF it be our duty to love God at all, this is the duty which is plainly <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in the <HI>order</HI> of offices. Our obliga|tion to our Creator is prior in the order of nature to our obligation to our fellow-men. This appears particularly from hence, That our obligation to love our neighbour ari&s;es principally from the will and command of God: but we could not have been under any obligation to comply with his will in this <HI>particular in&s;tance,</HI> had we not been under &s;ome antecedent obligation to him in general. It is the perfections of God that induce upon us an obligation to obey him at all. Our obligation, therefore, to acknowledge the divine perfections, to cul|tivate a proper regard to our Maker, or in the words of the text, to <HI>love the Lord our God with all our heart,</HI> is, in the nature of things, prior to all others: And upon this account it may be &s;aid, that <HI>this is the fir&s;t and great commandment.</HI> If, in our imaginations, we dive&s;t God of tho&s;e perfections, which at pre&s;ent we &s;uppo&s;e him to
<PB N="134" REF="006365_0137_1028B04738EF39D0">
be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, our obligation to obey him in any in|&s;tance vani&s;hes of cour&s;e. But &s;uppo&s;e him infinitely wi&s;e, good and powerful, and our obligation to love, honour and obey him, takes place immediately. So that our obligation to God is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> which we are under; it is, indeed, that into which all others may be re&s;olved. There is no duty which we owe to our neighbour, con|&s;idered as a <HI>religious</HI> duty, but what derives its obliga|tory force from the will and authority of God. And as the divine perfections are the original and &s;ole ground of all religious obligations in general, &s;o to have a &s;uitable internal love and e&s;teem of, and regard towards, tho&s;e perfections, is the primary and principal of all duties and obligations. But I &s;hall explain my&s;elf farther upon this head, under a <HI>&s;econd</HI> ob&s;ervation, <HI>namely,</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THAT the whole of <HI>religion,</HI> in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, ought to be con&s;idered as <HI>the &s;ervice of God,</HI> the &s;upreme Governour of the univer&s;e: and in this light it is u&s;ually con&s;idered in &s;cripture. Now 'tis apparent, that the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> thing, not only in point of <HI>order,</HI> but of importance al&s;o, is to form ju&s;t &s;entiments con|cerning the Being whom we &s;erve; to be &s;uitably af|fected towards him; to cultivate tho&s;e regards of e&s;teem, love, reverence, &amp;c. which the perfections of his nature, and his relation to us, demand. Religion mu&s;t originate here; there can be really no religion, no &s;ervice, that God can look upon as done in obedience to him, but what proceeds from this principle of love to him; and &s;uch a principle does, as it were, in&s;ure our obedience to him in all other in&s;tances. <HI>Loyalty of heart</HI> to our earthly <HI>&s;overeign;</HI> a proper &s;en&s;e of our duty to him, in general, is the foundation of obedience to him in all par|ticular in&s;tances. The more our hearts are attached to our <HI>prince,</HI> the better prepared, and, the more likely, are we, to yield a thorough and univer&s;al obedience to his laws. I &s;peak now of a temporal prince; but this holds equally with regard to God, the King of kings and
<PB N="135" REF="006365_0138_1028B08CB9D21020">
Lord of lords. Piety, or the love of God is the fir&s;t and principal thing is religion, as much as loyalty to our earthly &s;overeign, is the fir&s;t and principal thing in the character of a good <HI>&s;ubject.</HI> And this is, doubtle&s;s, the rea&s;on why the <HI>decalogue,</HI> that &s;ummary of man's duty, begins with our immediate duty to our Creator. When the <HI>law</HI> was given at <HI>mount Sinai,</HI> it was u&s;hered in thus, <HI>I am the Lord thy God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Thou &s;halt have no other gods before me.</HI> This injunction of loyalty, to the one true God prepared the way to, and u&s;hered in, all the other commandments. Nor was this order in delivering the law, <HI>accidental,</HI> or without any particular <HI>de&s;ign.</HI> It would be prepo&s;terous for a legi&s;lator to promulge any particular laws to his &s;ubjects, without fir&s;t a&s;&s;erting his own authority, and requiring his &s;ubjects to own, ac|knowledge and honour him as their prince, or lawgiver. This is the purport of the fir&s;t commandment in the decalogue: it requires tho&s;e to whom it was given, to own, acknowledge and honour the only true God; or, in the words of my text, to <HI>love the Lord their God with all their heart.</HI> And there is &s;omething analogous to the divine conduct in this particular, in the conduct of earthly princes, who, in the fir&s;t place, require <HI>an oath of allegiance</HI> from their &s;ubjects, in order to make way for their laws to be cordially received and obeyed. This is a cu&s;tom which has prevailed pretty generally in the world; and it is plain that it an&s;wers good ends in government. Nor is it le&s;s proper in the divine go|vernment, than in human, that we &s;hould be required in the fir&s;t place, and as the ground-work, the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of all, to have a &s;uitable regard towards him, who&s;e &s;ubjects we are; i. e. to honour and re&s;pect him as our prince. The general rea&s;on of this, is the &s;ame in both ca&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the nece&s;&s;ity of our acknowledging the legi&s;lator, in order to our obeying his laws. And this brings me to ob&s;erve, in the <HI>third</HI> place,</P>

3. THAT the love of God is the only &s;ure and &s;teady principle of virtue and righteou&s;ne&s;s in our conduct to|wards our fellow-men. The moral and &s;ocial virtues are, indeed, amiable in them&s;elves; worthy to be prac|ti&s;ed; and it would (ordinarily at lea&s;t) be the intere&s;t of mankind to practi&s;e them, even although there were no God at all. But con&s;idering the weakne&s;s of human rea&s;on, the &s;trength of human pa&s;&s;ion, and the force and variety of temptation; con&s;idering what men are in them&s;elves, and what a world they live in; it cannot well be &s;uppo&s;ed that they &s;hould uniformly act a vir|tuous part, from tho&s;e con&s;iderations alone. Virtue is amiable, and excellent in it&s;elf: But the bulk of man|kind are not formed to be &s;o powerfully &s;truck with the beauty and amiablene&s;s of it, as to di&s;arm temptation, and cau&s;e them to adhere to truth and right at the ex|pence of their pre&s;ent ea&s;e and plea&s;ure. To the con|&s;ideration of the <HI>fitne&s;s</HI> of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all other moral virtues; and the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> tendency of them towards happine&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the con&s;ideration of a righ|teous Governour of the world &s;hould be added; who&s;e po&s;itive will and command it is, that we &s;hould invari|ably practi&s;e tho&s;e virtues which are in them&s;elves good&punc; and who will finally <HI>render to every man according as his work &s;hall be</HI>&mdash;To exclude a God, and a righteous pro|vidence from the world, is (I will not &s;ay, wholly to break down the fence betwixt vice and virtue, and to make it wholly indifferent whether we practi&s;e the former or the latter; but it is) to deprive virtue of one of its greate&s;t &s;upports and guards. And it is to be remem|bered, that not to love God, not to cultivate tho&s;e reli|gious regards towards him, which the perfections of his nature demand, is to <HI>exclude</HI> him to all intents and pur|po&s;es, as to any influence which the knowledge and be|lief of him, can have upon our behaviour. The ac|knowledging of a God can have no good effect upon our conduct any farther than our hearts are &s;uitably af|fected towards him. So that there can be little or no
<PB N="137" REF="006365_0140_1028B090AABD4CA8">
real <HI>virtue</HI> without <HI>piety.</HI> If any thing puts men upon doing their duty towards their neighbour, and deters them from vice, when the eye of the world is not upon them, and when their temporal intere&s;t is forfeited thereby, it mu&s;t be a &s;en&s;e of the divine perfections upon their hearts; i. e. a principle of love to God, in the large &s;en&s;e in which that duty was before explained. Without this he will be continually in danger of relap&s;ing into vice, whenever a pre&s;ent advantage is to be gained thereby, notwith&s;tanding the beauty and amiablene&s;s of a contrary conduct. But let a man once have a &s;uitable &s;en&s;e of the Deity upon his mind; let him really <HI>love the Lord his God with all his heart,</HI> and this will be a con&s;tant principle of virtuous conduct in all conditions and circum|&s;tances of life. It amounts to little le&s;s than a contra|diction to &s;uppo&s;e that a man &s;hould really love God, and yet indulge him&s;elf in the practi&s;e of tho&s;e &s;ins which God has forbidden; and which he knows are con|trary to the divine perfections. The connexion betwixt the love of God, and obedience to his commandments, is &s;o clo&s;e and in&s;eparable, that St. <HI>John</HI> tells, That <HI>this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments:</HI> and again, <HI>Hereby do we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments&mdash;He that &s;aith, I know him, and keep|eth not his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him</HI>&mdash;The love of our neighbour (which includes all moral virtues in it) nece&s;&s;arily flows from the love of God, according to the &s;ame apo&s;tle&mdash;<HI>If any man &s;ay, I love God, and bateth his brother, he is a liar.</HI>&mdash;Nor is this le&s;s evident from rea&s;on than revelation. The love of God is the love of the divine perfections; 'tis the love of truth, goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice, holine&s;s, and all moral excellencies. And he that loves the&s;e perfections, can|not indulge him&s;elf in tho&s;e vices which are contrary to them: but will, of cour&s;e, practice all the moral vir|tues in his own life. It is a common ob&s;ervation, <HI>that &s;imilitude begets love;</HI> and it is equally true, <HI>that love be|gets &s;imilitude.</HI> What we love and admire in others,
<PB N="138" REF="006365_0141_1028B04E10A565F8">
we imitate, as naturally as we love in others tho&s;e di&s;po|&s;itions and humours that prevail in our&s;elves. So that if a man love God, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all moral perfec|tions, he mu&s;t, of cour&s;e be moulded into the &s;ame image him&s;elf; he will naturally conform his own temper and behaviour to the moral character of God, and <HI>be perfect, even as his Father which is in heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the&s;e con&s;iderations it follows, that although the ultimate de&s;ign of all the divine commandments, were to bring us to a &s;uitable temper and behaviour towards each other, in order to our mutual happine&s;s; yet &s;till, to <HI>love the Lord our God with all our heart,</HI> would be <HI>the fir&s;t and great commandment;</HI> upon account of the influence which the performance of this duty mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily have upon our moral conduct towards our neighbour; and the impo&s;&s;ibility of our adhering &s;tead|fa&s;tly to the practice of virtue without &s;uch a principle of divine love. Where the love of God takes place, the love of mankind and all the virtues that are com|prehended in it, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take place al&s;o: Nor can the latter take place to any good purpo&s;e or degree, where the former is wanting. The love of God is the fountain from whence the love of our neighbour flows: and to expect to find the latter in the brea&s;t where the former is not, is as vain as to expect to find a &s;tream which has no &s;ource from whence it is derived. All moral excellencies in mankind have their origin here, in a proper regard and di&s;po&s;ition of heart towards God: and this is &s;ufficient, of it&s;elf, to intitle this command to the place which our Lord has a&s;&s;igned it. But</P>
<P N="4">4. AND <HI>la&s;tly</HI> here, This may be &s;aid to be <HI>the fir&s;t and great commandment,</HI> becau&s;e the happine&s;s of good men in this world con&s;i&s;ts principally in exerci&s;ing tho&s;e re|ligious regards which are intended by the love of God. The duty con&s;i&s;ts in delight and complacency in God;
<PB N="139" REF="006365_0142_1028B0922EE4E200">
in contemplating his perfections; in re&s;ignation of heart to his will; in tru&s;t and dependance upon him; and hope and confidence in his goodne&s;s. And he that is formed to &s;uch a divine and heavenly temper as this, has the temper of happine&s;s. He has within him a &s;ecret &s;pring of peace and con&s;olation, that not only forbids him to be mi&s;erable, but al&s;o cau&s;es him to <HI>rejoice with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory.</HI> Without this principle of divine love, and tru&s;t in God, there can be but little happine&s;s injoyed in &s;uch a world of confu&s;ion and di&s;|order as this, where every thing is in a fluctuating con|dition; where nothing can be depended upon. God is the adequate, the only adequate, object of our affections; and our &s;upreme felicity in this world, as well as in the next, con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>enjoyment</HI> of him. So that had God con&s;ulted only our pre&s;ent happine&s;s, he could not have commanded us to do any thing which has &s;o great a tendency to promote it, and is &s;o clo&s;ely connected with it, as <HI>loving him with all our heart.</HI> This will, indeed, appear wild and fanciful to &s;ome men, who value them|&s;elves much upon their <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> but have no <HI>parts</HI> or <HI>capacity</HI> for devotion. However the happine&s;s of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ouls are formed to the love of God, the &s;upreme and everla&s;ting good, is not the le&s;s, becau&s;e &s;ome men have no <HI>ta&s;te</HI> or <HI>reli&s;h,</HI> for the &s;ublime and exalted plea&s;ures of piety.</P>
<P>HAVING thus, briefly &s;hown &s;ome of the grounds of that pre-eminence which our Lord gives to this com|mandment, I proceed</P>
<P>III.

<P N="1"><PB N="140" REF="006365_0143_1028B04F94AAF078">
1. UNDER the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> in&s;titution, and during the mini&s;try of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> prophets, the love of God and man, were the <HI>principal</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t important</HI> duties; more excellent in them&s;elves, more acceptable to God, and more beneficial to mankind, than the mo&s;t punctilious ob&s;ervation of the ceremonial parts of the law. The love of God, comprehending a &s;incere regard to, and hearty complacence in, all the divine perfections; and the love of our neighbour, compre|hending all moral, &s;ocial and relative virtues, were the <HI>&s;um</HI> and <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> of religion under the legal di&s;pen&s;ation. This is plainly implied in the a&s;&s;ertion, That <HI>on the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</HI> Every thing was of little account when put in competi|tion with the&s;e great and excellent duties. And this is plainly the light in which the prophets con&s;tantly taught the <HI>Jews</HI> to look upon the various precepts of the law. I &s;hall have time to quote only two or three pa&s;&s;ages, where &s;uch a pre-eminence is evidently given to the un|alterable duties of inward piety, and a life of charity and holine&s;s. To this effect are the words of the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> chap. i. <HI>To what purpo&s;es is the multitude of your &s;acrifices unto me, &s;aith the Lord?&mdash;Bring no more vain oblations&mdash;your hands are full of blood. Wa&s;h ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well, &s;eek judgment, re|lieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, judge the fatherle&s;s, plead for the widow.</HI> So <HI>Micah</HI> vi. 5, and onwards&mdash;<HI>Hear O my people! remember now what Balak king of Moab con&s;ulted&mdash;wherewith &s;hall I come before the Lord, and bow my&s;elf before the high God? &s;hall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be plea&s;ed with thou|&s;ands of rams, or with ten thou&s;ands of rivers of oil? &s;hall I give my fir&s;t born for my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; the fruit of my body for the &s;in of my &s;oul? He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord thy God re|quire of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</HI> The&s;e duties are the &s;ame
<PB N="141" REF="006365_0144_1028B094F3DE6D58">
with tho&s;e in the text; and the &s;ame which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;tiled <HI>the weightier matters of the law, Matt.</HI> xxiii. 23. and with the omi&s;&s;ion of which, he upbraids the <HI>Phari&s;ees, Luke</HI> xi. 42. <HI>But woe unto you Phari&s;ees; for ye tythe mint and rue and all manner of herbs; and pa&s;s over judgment and the love of God; the&s;e ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE a&s;&s;ertion before us may carry &s;omething more in it, than that the love of God and man, were the <HI>mo&s;t important</HI> of any duties of the law&mdash;<HI>On the&s;e two com|mandments hang all the law and the prophets</HI>&mdash;This may po&s;&s;ibly intend, that the&s;e two general precepts, do in effect, and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, comprehend all other duties in them, of what kind &s;oever.&mdash;Not &s;trictly, indeed; for then no compari&s;on could properly be made betwixt them, and others&mdash;But as he that obeys them, he that has a real principle of love to God and man in his heart, will naturally be led to do his duty in every other in|&s;tance&mdash;to wor&s;hip God in &s;uch manner as he requires, and to di&s;charge all the duties which he owes to him&s;elf, and to his neighbour, in his particular &s;tation. The&s;e two virtues, as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> were, comprehend all others in them. For he that &s;incerely loves and honours God in his heart, cannot fail to perform all the external acts of piety which God has injoined, all the duties of the <HI>fir&s;t table;</HI> and from the love of our neighbour naturally flow, all the duties of the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> all the duties which we owe to one another. So that to love God and our neighbour, is, in effect, to obey the whole law and the prophets; and to do all that God requires of us. And thus do <HI>all the law and the prophets, hang on the&s;e two commandments.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. AND <HI>la&s;tly;</HI> In this po&s;ition it may be implied, That the <HI>end</HI> and <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of all po&s;itive in&s;titutions; of all precepts not &s;trictly comprehended in the&s;e natural and unalterable duties of piety and charity, was to bring men to the practice of them. All the rituals of religion,

as appointed under the law, had &s;ome reference to the&s;e e&s;&s;ential duties; they were not injoined under the no|tion of having any natural and inherent excellence or goodne&s;s in them; but as means to bring men to a proper temper of mind towards their Maker, and one another; neither were they valuable or beneficial any farther than as they promoted this end, even &s;incere piety, and a life of holine&s;s and charity. In the&s;e things con&s;i&s;ted real religion; and every thing be&s;ides, had no other relation to religion, but that of <HI>means</HI> to an <HI>end.</HI> The rituals of religion, though ob&s;erved with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s, were rather an abomination, than a plea&s;ure, to the Lord, when they were not accompanied, or followed, by the&s;e natural and e&s;&s;ential duties. Thus much is plainly implied in tho&s;e words of the prophet, I&s;ai. lxvi. 2&mdash;5.&mdash;<HI>To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite &s;pirit, and trembleth at my word.

I al&s;o will chu&s;e their delu&s;ions,&mdash;becau&s;e when I called, none did an&s;wer; when I &s;pake they did not hear; but they did evil before mine eyes, and cho&s;e that in which I delighted not.</HI></P>

IV. To &s;how, that the&s;e two commandments have the &s;ame place and pre-eminence, under the <HI>go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> which they had under the <HI>legal:</HI> Or, in other words, That <HI>all the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t hangs on the&s;e two commandments,</HI> in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that <HI>all the law and the prophets did.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, that I may avoid ob&s;curity, and obviate &s;ome objections which the ignorant, or the cavilling, might, perhaps, rai&s;e again&s;t this a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall briefly premi&s;e two or three things for the explanation of it, before I proceed to prove it.</P>
<P>FIRST then, it may be ob&s;erved, That this a&s;&s;ertion relates only to <HI>duty,</HI> or <HI>practical religion,</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>faith</HI> or <HI>belief.</HI> When our Saviour &s;aid that <HI>all the law and the prophets hang on the&s;e two commandments,</HI> he &s;pake of the <HI>preceptive</HI> part of the law, and the <HI>duty</HI> of <HI>Jews,</HI> who were &s;uppo&s;ed already to <HI>believe</HI> the law and the prophets, and to be fully convinced of their di|vine original. To &s;uch per&s;ons as the&s;e he &s;ays, that there were no commands of &s;o much importance, as tho&s;e which related to the love of God, and of their neighbour. In the&s;e things con&s;i&s;ted the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of duty under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> oeconomy. Our Lord was not &s;peak|ing of what was the &s;ub&s;tance of <HI>natural</HI> religion, but of the <HI>mo&s;aic,</HI> which was of divine in&s;titution, and received as &s;uch by the po&s;terity of <HI>Abraham.</HI> And accordingly, when it is now &s;aid under the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, that <HI>all the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t hangs on the&s;e two commandments, the love of God and man,</HI> it is pre&s;uppo&s;ed that chri&s;tianity is believed; that Chri&s;t is received as <HI>a teacher &s;ent from God;</HI> as the <HI>promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> and that the doctrines of his <HI>incarnation, death, re&s;urrection</HI> and <HI>a&s;cention</HI> into heaven; and, in &s;hort, all the doctrines delivered either by him&s;elf, or his in&s;pired apo&s;tles, are firmly believed. This being &s;uppo&s;ed, if the que&s;tion were a&s;ked, <HI>which is the great commandment in the go&s;pel?</HI> the true an&s;wer
<PB N="144" REF="006365_0147_1028B0558CC0B5A0">
to it, (putting only the term <HI>go&s;pel</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>law</HI> and <HI>prophets)</HI> would be the &s;ame our Lord gives to the <HI>lawyer</HI> in the text&mdash;<HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind. This is the fir&s;t and great commandment: And the &s;econd is like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf: on the&s;e two commandments hangs all the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, It is not implied in this, that it is of no importance, whether <HI>chri&s;tians</HI> obey the <HI>po&s;itive in&s;titutions</HI> of the go&s;pel or not, provided they practice the natural duties of piety and charity. As our Lord did not &s;et a&s;ide the rituals of religion under the law intirely by giving the preference to the love of God, and of man|kind; &s;o neither are they &s;et a&s;ide by tho&s;e who apply his a&s;&s;ertion concerning the law and prophets, to the go&s;pel. The contrary is rather implied. And it is a truth obvious to common &s;en&s;e, that all God's command|ments, without exception, are to be obeyed; tho&s;e of a <HI>ritual,</HI> as well as tho&s;e of a <HI>moral,</HI> nature. But &s;till, as there were <HI>the weightier matters of the law</HI> under the <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation, when a compari&s;on was made be|twixt the &s;everal commandments of it; &s;o there are <HI>the weightier matters of the go&s;pel</HI> al&s;o; and the&s;e are exactly the &s;ame under both di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>LASTLY here: When I &s;peak of the &s;ub&s;tance of <HI>chri&s;tian duty,</HI> and the weightier matters of the go&s;pel, as con&s;i&s;ting in the natural duties of piety and charity; or the love of God, and man; I would be &s;uppo&s;ed to intend, that the&s;e duties &s;hould be performed upon <HI>evan|gelical</HI> principles. The duties in them&s;elves are really duties of <HI>natural religion;</HI> but being adopted into <HI>chri&s;tianity,</HI> they are to be performed upon <HI>chri&s;tian principles,</HI> and from <HI>go&s;pel motives;</HI> with a proper <HI>re|gard to,</HI> and <HI>dependance upon,</HI> the <HI>Mediator of this new covenant, who gave him&s;elf for us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="006365_0148_1028B09AB7049C28">
WITH the&s;e explanations, I hope none will think the a&s;&s;ertion &s;trange, That the&s;e two commands contain the &s;um of chri&s;tian duty; and that they ought to have the &s;ame pre-eminence under the go&s;pel, which they had under the law.</P>
<P>THE main de&s;ign of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution is evi|dently to bring men to that moral purity of heart and life, which is compri&s;ed in the love of God and of our neighbour. Neither the mo&s;t exact compliance with the po&s;itive precepts of the go&s;pel, nor any kind or de|gree of faith, unaccompanied with a principle of &s;incere piety and charity; nor, indeed, any thing el&s;e, where the love of God and man are wanting, can intitle us to the divine acceptance hereafter; or <HI>make us meet to be par|takers of the inheritance of the &s;aints in light.</HI> If we believe in Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, &s;o far it is well: but this does but lay the foundation for our doing that, upon which our &s;alvation finally turns. A right faith is an excellent and valuable thing; but it is advantageous no farther than it <HI>purifies the heart,</HI> and <HI>works by love;</HI> no farther than it transforms our minds into the divine likene&s;s; and leads us to live an holy and godly life. Thus the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> exhorts us, to <HI>give all diligence,</HI> and to <HI>add to our faith, virtue;</HI> [con&s;tancy, re&s;olu|tion, fortitude] <HI>and to virtue, knowledge; and to know|ledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to pa|tience, godline&s;s; and to godline&s;s, brotherly kindne&s;s; and to brotherly kindne&s;s, charity. For,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>if the&s;e things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye &s;hall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But he that lacketh the&s;e things is blind</HI>&mdash;2 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 5&mdash;It is practical religion, the love of God, and a life of righteou&s;ne&s;s and charity, proceeding from faith in Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, that denominates us good men and good chri&s;tians&mdash;Not wearing <HI>the form of godli|ne&s;s</HI>&mdash;Not the <HI>belief</HI> of any doctrines, however true, concerning the <HI>atonement</HI> of Chri&s;t&mdash;Not a lazy <HI>recum|bency</HI>

upon the righteou&s;ne&s;s of another&mdash;Not any <HI>en|thu&s;ia&s;tic fervors</HI> of &s;pirit&mdash;Not a firm <HI>per&s;wa&s;ion</HI> that we are <HI>elected</HI> of God, and that our <HI>names are written in the book of life</HI>&mdash;Some of the wor&s;t men in the world, have as much <HI>faith</HI> as any in it&mdash;attend upon <HI>&s;ermons</HI> and <HI>&s;acraments</HI> as often&mdash;<HI>rely</HI> as confidently&mdash;have as <HI>warm frames</HI> and <HI>lively imaginations</HI>&mdash;and are as fully <HI>per&s;waded</HI> of their being <HI>cho&s;en to &s;alvation.</HI> But what does all this avail, if that <HI>faith be without works?</HI> if that <HI>form of godline&s;s</HI> be without <HI>the power?</HI> if that <HI>reliance</HI> upon the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, be thought to &s;uper&s;ede <HI>per&s;onal</HI> and <HI>inherent</HI> holine&s;s?&mdash;if tho&s;e <HI>fervors</HI> of &s;oul, are unattended by <HI>divine love</HI> and <HI>charity?</HI>&mdash;if tho&s;e <HI>tow|ring imaginations,</HI> are but the <HI>vagaries of a wild fancy?</HI>&mdash;and that <HI>per&s;wa&s;ion</HI> of their <HI>election,</HI> proceed from vanity only, and not from their having <HI>given diligence to make their calling and election &s;ure?</HI></P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in the iid chap. of his epi&s;tle to <HI>Titus,</HI> charges him to inculcate various moral and rela|tive duties in his preaching; and then inforces this charge with an argument taken from the general de&s;ign of the go&s;pel.&mdash;<HI>For the grace of God,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>has ap|peared unto all men, teaching us that, denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly and righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world, looking for the ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might re|deem us from all iniquity; and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</HI> The&s;e words are plainly expre&s;&s;ive of the main &s;cope and intention of Chri&s;t's me|diation, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the bringing of mankind to real holine&s;s of heart and manners; or, in other words, to the love of God and of our neighbour. In the next chapter this &s;ame apo&s;tle commands <HI>Titus</HI> to teach the importance and nece&s;&s;ity of chri&s;tian obedience, and good works. <HI>This is a faithful &s;aying, &s;ays he, and the&s;e things I will that thou affirm con&s;tantly, that they which have believed in

God might he careful to maintain gook works: the&s;e things are good and profitable unto men.</HI> In what does St. <HI>James</HI> place the &s;ub&s;tance of religion? <HI>Pure religion and unde|filed before God, even the Father is this, to vi&s;it the father|le&s;s and widows in their affliction, and to keep a man's &s;elf un&s;potted from</HI> the world.

and irrational manner of preaching, have even been compelled to deny that he preached the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> or de&s;igned to do it; alledging that his doctrines and manner of preaching were <HI>legal.</HI> The irre&s;i&s;tible conviction which the&s;e men have, that their own doc|trines and di&s;cour&s;es are of a very different ca&s;t and tenor from tho&s;e of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, has put them upon making this wretched and impious eva&s;ion.

<P>I hope it appears from what has been &s;aid, that the love of God and of our neighbour; that &s;incere piety of heart; and a righteous, holy and charitable life; are <HI>the weightier matters of the go&s;pel,</HI> as well as of <HI>the law.</HI> Indeed the&s;e are more evidently the &s;ub&s;tance of <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> duty, than of <HI>jewi&s;h.</HI> Under the go&s;pel, rituals are in|deed of le&s;s account than they were under the law.

and beggarly elements</HI> even under the law. And they are much more &s;o under the Go&s;pel, when compared to that <HI>&s;piritual &s;acrifice</HI> which chri&s;tians are to offer to God.

<P>UPON the whole then, the ca&s;e &s;eems to &s;tand thus&mdash;Although the chri&s;tian revelation brings us acquainted with many truths be&s;ides tho&s;e which the light of nature &s;ugge&s;ts, or <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> plainly taught; although it injoins us to do &s;everal things which would not have been ob|ligatory without an explicit command; although it furni&s;hes us with a great variety of new and excellent motives to excite us to the practice of our duty in all its branches; and although chri&s;tianity cannot, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, with any &s;en&s;e or propriety, be &s;aid to be the &s;ame with natural religion, or only a re-publication of the law of nature; yet the principal, the mo&s;t important and fundamental duties required by chri&s;tianity are, neverthele&s;s, the &s;ame which were injoined as &s;uch under the legal di&s;pen&s;ation; and the &s;ame which are dictated by the light of nature. They are natural moral duties, inforced with revealed and &s;upernatural motives; and to be performed from principles peculiar to the go&s;pel. And, indeed, it is plain beyond di&s;pute, that the &s;ub|&s;tance of true religion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the &s;ame, not only under the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> di&s;pen&s;ations, but al&s;o, in all countries, to all rational creatures, in all parts of the univer&s;e, in all periods of time. Modes and cere|monies of religion may, indeed, be various as the circum|&s;tances and condition of men; and God may afford dif|ferent degrees of light and knowledge in different times and places: But the &s;um of our duty re&s;ults from the nature of God, our relation to him, and one another. And this mu&s;t therefore be as immutable as God him&s;elf, <HI>with whom is no variablene&s;s, neither &s;hadow of turning.</HI> As God is the &s;ame in all times and places; as mankind

bear the &s;ame general relation to him in all times and places; and as our relation to each other is always the &s;ame, except as to &s;ome trivial and merely circum&s;tantial difference; &s;o the &s;ub&s;tance of human duty mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be the &s;ame al&s;o in all times and places. There cannot be any other than circum&s;tantial differences in the duty, obligation and religion, of creatures who are the offspring of the &s;ame God; creatures endowed with the &s;ame common nature; and creatures bearing the &s;ame general relation to each other. Now that religion which mu&s;t remain invariably the &s;ame, under every change of circum&s;tance, through all ages, in all places, and to all rational beings, con&s;i&s;ts in the love and veneration of the &s;upreme Father and Lord of the univer&s;e, and in the practice of righteou&s;ne&s;s and charity. This is the reli|gion which is common to earth and heaven: It is the religion of <HI>angels</HI> and <HI>arch-angels</HI> above, as well as of <HI>&s;aints</HI> below: This was the religion of paradi&s;e before the apo&s;tacy of mankind: This was the religion of <HI>Noah</HI> before the flood: This was the religion of the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> afterwards: This was the religion of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> before the law: This was the religion which was ra|tified by God at mount <HI>Sinai:</HI> This was the religion of <HI>the law and the prophets</HI> to the day of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah:</HI> This was the religion which <HI>He</HI> and his apo&s;tles principally inculcated upon mankind, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation: And this will be the religion, the employment and the happine&s;s of <HI>the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect</HI> here|after in the kingdom of heaven; for the love of God, and <HI>charity</HI> &s;hall <HI>never fail,</HI> although <HI>whether there be pro|phecies, they &s;hall fail; whether there be tongues, they &s;hall cea&s;e; and although, whether there be knowledge, it &s;hall vani&s;h away.</HI></P>
<P>THUS do the&s;e two duties claim the &s;ame place and pre-eminence under the evangelical di&s;pen&s;ation which they had in the law and the prophets: <HI>On the&s;e two commandments hangs all the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>

There are various moral reflections and inferences which naturally ari&s;e from what has been now di&s;cour&s;ed; and &s;o I mu&s;t beg your patience a few minutes longer.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEN, if the love of God and of our neighbour be the <HI>weightier matters of the go&s;pel</HI> as well as of <HI>the law,</HI> we are naturally led to bewail the folly, and un|happy condition of tho&s;e who, in a manner, leave the&s;e out of their religion. There are innumerable per&s;ons even in the chri&s;tian world, who, neglecting that &s;ub|&s;tantial religion which con&s;i&s;ts in the practice of the&s;e &s;ublime and heavenly duties, employ all their zeal, care and diligence about things of little or no importance. Chri&s;tianity is principally an in&s;titution of life and man|ners; de&s;igned to teach us how to be good men, and to &s;how us the nece&s;&s;ity of becoming &s;o. But there are multitudes who call them&s;elves chri&s;tians, who content them&s;elves with an idle, &s;peculative belief of certain notions and doctrines, without troubling them&s;elves about that <HI>holine&s;s, without</HI> which we are told, that <HI>no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> They <HI>know</HI> their duty <HI>&s;o exactly,</HI> and <HI>be|lieve</HI> it <HI>&s;o firmly,</HI> that they imagine they may well be excu&s;ed from <HI>doing</HI> it. If they have but a great deal of faith, and rely &s;trongly upon the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, they think they cannot mi&s;s of &s;alvation, al|though, by their &s;ins, they daily <HI>crucify the &s;on of God afre&s;h, and put him to an open &s;hame.</HI> Some are plea&s;ing them&s;elves with a round of empty formalities, imagining that religion con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in frequent fa&s;tings, attend|ing upon &s;acraments, and wor&s;hiping God with a great deal of outward pomp and ceremony. They forget that <HI>God is a &s;pirit;</HI> and to be <HI>wor&s;hipped</HI> chiefly <HI>in &s;pirit:</HI> and love all kinds of ordinances much better than they love their neighbours. There are many, were they a&s;ked, which was the fir&s;t and great commandment, if they gave an an&s;wer agreable to their own practice,
<PB N="153" REF="006365_0156_1028B0A74A6DD490">
mu&s;t &s;ay&mdash;Thou &s;halt tell beads devoutly; vi&s;it the &s;epulchres of antient &s;aints; fall down before reliques; pay homage to painted canvas, to carved &s;tones, and moulded clay, pray frequently to the mother of God; or the like: and if they thought at all of the love of God, and our neighbour, would a&s;&s;ign them only that low place which our Lord gives to tything mint, ani&s;e and cummin. Others place religion chiefly in having frequent raptures, and &s;trange tran&s;ports of mechanical devotion; in which the le&s;s they exerci&s;e their rea&s;on, the better and more glorious it is. For 'till they have lo&s;t all <HI>human under&s;tanding,</HI> they think it impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould get a <HI>divine one.</HI> Thus they go on, rai&s;ing them|&s;elves from one degree of religious phrenzy to another, till they run quite <HI>divinely mad;</HI> and then they imagine, that with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> they are <HI>caught up into the third heaven;</HI> that they <HI>hear un&s;peakable words;</HI> that they <HI>&s;ee vi&s;ions,</HI> and have <HI>a multitude of revelations given to them.</HI> And the con&s;equence of this is, that they <HI>are lifted up above mea&s;ure.</HI> They then look down with contempt upon all <HI>moral duties,</HI> as being below &s;uch <HI>&s;piritual men.</HI> They are for a religion that con&s;i&s;ts in &s;omething more refined and &s;ublime than the love of God and their neighbour; the&s;e are but barely rational and natural duties, and fit only for <HI>carnal men,</HI> or, at be&s;t, babes in grace. Nothing can hit the refined ta&s;te of the&s;e <HI>Goliah's</HI> in chri&s;tianity, but what has &s;ome my|&s;terious &s;ublimity in it, and is quite remote from rea&s;on. What is plain and obvious is too low and vulgar for &s;uch great proficients in grace and &s;piritual knowledge. God forbid that I &s;hould &s;ay any thing to di&s;courage a lively and warm devotion. But &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;tic flights as the&s;e, have no countenance from the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. And the almo&s;t invariable con&s;equence of indulging them, is the neglect of &s;olid, &s;ub&s;tantial religion; a rational love of God, of mankind, and the practice of moral virtue. When per&s;ons once get to ga&s;ping thus eagerly after immediate in&s;piration, they generally bewilder them|&s;elves,
<PB N="154" REF="006365_0157_1028B0BC14689048">
lo&s;e &s;ight of common &s;en&s;e, and neglect &s;ober religion for the &s;ake of having fermented &s;pirits, and &s;uperficial fla&s;hes of joy. They impute all their ravings and follies and wild imaginations to the &s;pirit of God; and u&s;ually think them&s;elves <HI>converted,</HI> when the poor, unhappy creatures are only <HI>out of their wits.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. SINCE the &s;ub&s;tance of chri&s;tian duty con&s;i&s;ts in the love of God and of our neighbour, and in the practice of morality, this &s;hows us what a go&s;pel-mini&s;ter's preaching ought chiefly to turn upon. When he is con|cerned with &s;uch as are already chri&s;tians in <HI>belief</HI> and <HI>&s;peculation;</HI> that which he has to do &s;till is to bring them to be chri&s;tians in heart and behaviour&mdash;Not to dwell upon &s;peculative points&mdash;upon trifling di&s;tinctions, and upon metaphy&s;ical niceties, which can only perplex his hearers, without bettering their minds and morals&mdash;But to ex|cite them to put on a temper of mind and an outward conver&s;ation, which corre&s;ponds to their holy profe&s;&s;ion; and, in the words of my text, to <HI>love the Lord their God with all their heart, and their neighbour as them&s;elves</HI> However, this is too plainly neglected by many. Their con&s;tant cry is&mdash;"Believe, believe"&mdash;"Come to Chri&s;t"&mdash;"Depend upon his righteou&s;ne&s;s." As for holine&s;s and good works, they very rarely mention them; and when they do, it is rather with a de&s;ign to undervalue them, and per&s;wade people that they are good for nothing, than to inforce them as the indi&s;pen|&s;able condition of &s;alvation. Nay, the&s;e things are not only &s;poken of very often as being perfectly u&s;ele&s;s, but even hazardous to the fouls of men. Good God! that the de&s;ign of thy go&s;pel &s;hould be thus fru&s;trated by tho&s;e who&s;e immediate office it is, to inforce the holy precepts of it upon mankind!&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. HENCE it follows, that tho&s;e people who are of|fended with moral di&s;cour&s;es, under the notion that they are not <HI>evangelical,</HI> are gro&s;ly ignorant of the very &s;pirit
<PB N="155" REF="006365_0158_1028B0A8CD27CC40">
and de&s;ign of chri&s;tianity&mdash;They <HI>know not what they &s;ay, nor whereof they affirm;</HI> and <HI>need to be taught what</HI> are the rudiments and <HI>fir&s;t principles of the oracles of God.</HI> Such ignorant, licentious perverters of the go&s;pel, the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy. The time will come,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>when they will not endure &s;ound doctrine. But after their own lu&s;ts &s;hall they heap unto them&s;elves teachers, having itching ears; and they &s;hall turn away their ears from the truth, and be turned unto fables.</HI> And, indeed, of all <HI>fables</HI> that ever were devi&s;ed, there was never one that, either for &s;illine&s;s or impiety, equalled this, that faith without works, without the love of God and man, and a life of holine&s;s, is &s;ufficient to bring us to heaven.</P>
<P N="4">4. FROM what has been &s;aid, we may &s;ee what tho&s;e doctrines of the go&s;pel are, which ought to be defended and propagated with the greate&s;t zeal, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> tho&s;e which more immediately relate to practice; to the love of God and man&mdash;A zeal for all &s;uch doctrines is <HI>a zeal ac|cording to knowledge.</HI> But it is apparent, that the&s;e have been but little regarded by many chri&s;tians, in compari&s;on of others which a man might di&s;believe without hurting his morals, or endangering his &s;alvation. Tho&s;e things which have kept the chri&s;tian world in an eternal fer|ment; which have &s;harpened the &s;pirits of men; and &s;et little angry bigots a &s;narling and growling at one another, are nice metaphy&s;ical fooleries, &s;chola&s;tic di&s;tinctions without any difference, and mere words without a mean|ing. The&s;e are the things, (or rather the <HI>nothings</HI>) which have been di&s;puted about, to the neglect of <HI>the weightier matters of the go&s;pel;</HI> and even to the de&s;truc|tion of all piety and brotherly love; of every thing be|coming a man and a chri&s;tian. So hot and furious have many profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians been in all ages, and &s;o wrath|ful their contentions, about nothing, or mere trifles, that one unacquainted with the genius of their religion, would be apt to think it a very different thing from what it is.
<PB N="156" REF="006365_0159_1028B0C04AAEDD00">
He might be apt to think that the ma&s;ter of the&s;e furi|ous, railing, and burning di&s;putants, had left it in expre&s;s charge, as the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of his di&s;ciples,&mdash;not that they &s;hould <HI>be wi&s;e as &s;erpents, and harmle&s;s as doves</HI>&mdash;not that they &s;hould <HI>love one another;</HI> and prac|tice mutual forbearance and conde&s;cention&mdash;and do unto all men as they would be done by&mdash;but that they &s;hould be venemous and malicious as &s;erpents&mdash;hate one another with all their hearts&mdash;do to every one as they would be willing to be done to by none&mdash;go together by the ears about words and &s;ounds&mdash;drag each other to goals and gibbets&mdash;to dungeons, and the flames&mdash;and con&s;ign all over to hell-fire at la&s;t, who could not immediately pronounce their uncouth <HI>&s;hibboleths</HI>&mdash;But O ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us! thou Saviour of the world! is this for <HI>thy di&s;ciples to love one another as thou ha&s;t loved them?</HI> Or did&s;t thou mercifully <HI>make peace</HI> betwixt God and man <HI>by the blood of thy cro&s;s,</HI> that men being at peace with God, might thus make war upon one another, and inhumanly &s;hed each others blood! But</P>
<P N="5">5. AND to conclude: &s;uffer me to be&s;eech you all &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider of the nature, the great end and de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, and principally to regard what is of the great|e&s;t importance. Content not your&s;elves with believing well&mdash;with being zealous either for, or again&s;t, any particular doctrines&mdash;with practi&s;ing the rituals of religion&mdash;with being &s;anguine in the vindication of any particular &s;ect or party, or in oppo&s;ing any&mdash;The&s;e things will not &s;ecure your &s;alvation. 'Tis then and then only, that you will be the real di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, &s;uch as he will own and reward at the la&s;t day, when your faith has its genuine influence upon your hearts and lives; when it in&s;pires you with the love of God, and of your neighbour; when it cau&s;es you to <HI>break off your &s;ins by repentance, and your iniquities by turning to the Lord.</HI> This moral purity of heart and life, is that religion which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour has taught; it is that religion which employed

his lips; and which all his behaviour preached to the world, more eloquently and louder than a thou&s;and tongues. For God's &s;ake, for your own &s;ake, for the honour of the go&s;pel, and your profe&s;&s;ion; <HI>let no man deceive you with vain words. He that doth righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and he only, <HI>is righteous.</HI> Let no man amu&s;e you with idle, impious &s;tories, as if faith, and reliance upon Chri&s;t, were all that the go&s;pel made nece&s;&s;ary in order to your &s;alvation. As &s;urely as the go&s;pel is a real revelation, &s;o &s;urely are the&s;e notions a mere dream&mdash;a fable&mdash;a fable wherein folly and wickedne&s;s &s;eem to &s;trive for prece|dency&mdash;As &s;ure as there is a God in heaven, no man will go thither <HI>to behold his glory,</HI> and to enjoy the ever|la&s;ting plea&s;ures that are at his right hand, unle&s;s he for|&s;akes his &s;ins, and becomes holy as God is holy. I con|clude with tho&s;e words with which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour concluded his &s;ermon upon the <HI>mount, Mat.</HI> 7. 24&mdash;28.&mdash;<HI>who&s;oever heareth the&s;e &s;ayings of mine, and doth them, I will like him unto a wi&s;e man which built his hou&s;e upon a rock: And the rain de&s;cended, and the floods came, and the wilds blew, and beat upon that hou&s;e&punc; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth the&s;e &s;ayings of mine, and doth them not, &s;hall be likened unto a fooli&s;h man which built his hou&s;e upon the &s;and: And the rain de&s;cended, and the floods came, and the wilds blew, and beat upon that hou&s;e; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</HI></P>
