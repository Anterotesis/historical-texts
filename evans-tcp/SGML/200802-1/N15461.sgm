Dead flies cau&s;e the ointment of the Apothecary to &s;end forth a &s;tinking &s;avor: &s;o doth a little folly him that is in repu|tation for wi&s;dom and honour.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is hoped that the feelings of none in the a&s;&s;embly will be wounded by the introduction of this maxim, which may &s;eem unpoli&s;hed; when it is con&s;idered that it was penned by a per&s;on of the fir&s;t character for di&s;cern|ment: who was al&s;o the chief magi&s;trate of a great king|dom, and under the &s;uperintending influence of the Holy Spirit. King Solomon made choice of the wi&s;dom requi|&s;ite for his important &s;tation, and God graciou&s;ly gave him his de&s;ire.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, iii.5&mdash;12.</NOTE> From that wi&s;dom, improved by long experience, and directed by &s;upernatural influence, he was eminently qualified to give proper in&s;truction to per|&s;ons of every condition in life: both as it con&s;i&s;ted in general maxims, and in the application of them to particular ca&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="019699_0005_0FAC99482285F3A0">THE pa&s;&s;age before us contains a general principle, ap|plicable to a variety of particular characters. It will ap|ply to all who are di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;uppo&s;ed worth, and re&s;pected by mankind on that account: to all who are in &s;tations of eminence, where their accompli&s;hments are con&s;picuous, and their faults, if they have any, are not hidden. The&s;e are the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of that wi&s;dom and ho|nour, which is compared to the precious ointment of the apothecary: that good name which is even more valuable than precious ointment. A little folly, however, in a character &s;o con&s;picuous, and exalted, will tarni&s;h its beauty, and diffu&s;e an ill favour through the &s;weet per|fume.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Text and Chap vii.1.</NOTE></P>
<P>As the maxim in the text is fitted to &s;uch an exten&s;ive application, to per&s;ons of eminence in the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, it requires our &s;erious attention on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>A DISCUSSION of the &s;ubject is propo&s;ed in the following manner.</P>
<P N="1">I. A DESCRIPTION of a reputable character, or good name, will be attempted.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE de&s;tructive influence of folly, when mixed with &s;uch a character, will be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="3">III. AN application of the general maxim to particular characters, will conclude the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. A DESCRIPTION of a good name, or reputable cha|racter, will be attempted.</P>
<P>THE compari&s;on of a good name, to the precious oint|ment of the apothecary, is implied in the text and other &s;acred pa&s;&s;ages.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;tes vii.1. Canticles i.3.</NOTE></P>
<P>FROM an in&s;titution in the antient Mo&s;aic writings we learn that an holy anointing oil was to be made, by a mix|ture
<PB N="7" REF="019699_0006_0FAC9948E267F008">
of the mo&s;t excellent &s;pices, with the pure oil of the olive tree. With this precious ointment, the prie&s;ts, the tabernacle, and its uten&s;ils were to be anointed, as a con|&s;ecration to the particular &s;ervice of God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exodus xxx.22&mdash;38.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS holy oil which was not to be imitated, or even applied, except for the purpo&s;es, and in the manner &s;peci|fied in the institution, was evidently de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the excellent nature of true religion, and of the Holy Spi|rit, in his &s;anctifying influences on the hearts of men.&mdash; Tho&s;e be&s;t accomplishments of the human mind&mdash;as there is, in the&s;e, a combination of the mo&s;t amiable qual|ities compo&s;ing the character of the man of God.</P>
<P>A LIKE mode of expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed, by the in&s;pired p&s;almi&s;t, to illu&s;trate the mutual and harmonious affection of brethren, dwelling together in unity&mdash;and the happy influence of that affection.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxxxiii.</NOTE> Finally, the excellent qual|ities and unequalled glories of the divine Me&s;&s;iah, are repre&s;ented under this &s;ame metaphor.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xlv.6, 7, 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE idea running through the &s;everal repre&s;entations is, obviou&s;ly, the &s;ame. A variety of individual objects, excellent in them&s;elves, united and combined, in &s;uch a manner as to con&s;titute one complete object. In which the beauty of each is, not only pre&s;erved, but exhibited, with &s;uperior advantage; by its connection with the re&s;t, in &s;uch a manner, as to heighten the perfection of the whole.</P>
<P>THIS is true with regard to the beauty of all complex objects. <HI>It con&s;i&s;ts in the due proportion of each part, to the u&s;e for which it is de&s;igned&mdash;to its various relations, and to the whole.</HI> This will appear by an application of the ob|&s;ervation to objects confe&s;&s;edly beautiful, in the various productions of nature and art. In the&s;e la&s;t, we are, &s;ometimes, agreeably entertained and improved, by view|ing the di&s;plays of human &s;agacity. But, in the fir&s;t, we
<PB N="8" REF="019699_0007_0FAC994A6292F3C0">
are &s;truck with plea&s;ing and devout a&s;toni&s;hment, at their inimitable beauty and grandeur. And, by the perfection di&s;cernible in his various works, from the mo&s;t &s;imple and minute, to the mo&s;t complex and magnificent, we are led "to look through nature, up to nature's God."</P>
<P>THE beautiful, the exact gradations, and proportions, by which they are con&s;tituted and directed, impre&s;s the devour philo&s;opher with the deepe&s;t reverence for the Mo&s;t High, and lead him to acknowledge that "the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament &s;heweth his handy works"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xix.i.</NOTE>&mdash;and that "in wi&s;dom he hath made them all."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm civ.24:</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t not indulge in the&s;e general reflections, but confine our attention to that particular &s;pecies of beauty, which con&s;titute a good character. Are material and inanimate objects beautiful, intelligent creatures mu&s;t be capable of that which is far greater, and more perfect &mdash;in proportion to the &s;uperior nature of the &s;oul. This beauty of the mind, is what renders man worthy of e&s;teem, and by which he obtains the approbation of the wi&s;e and good.</P>
<P>IT is worthy of notice, that the perfection of the pre|cious ointment, referred to in the text, con&s;i&s;ted in the ex|cellent quality of its &s;everal parts, and their due propor|tion to each other. In like manner, a good name is the re&s;ult of a compo&s;ition of mental excellencies, fitly pro|portioned to each other, and to their object.</P>
<P>HUMAN perfection may be &s;ummed up in the excel|lent qualities of the under&s;tanding, and the heart. All our perceptions and knowledge belong to the former, and all emotions, affections, and determinations, to the latter. The beauty of the under&s;tanding con&s;i&s;ts in its &s;u&s;cepiibil|ity of tho&s;e perceptions, by which we are furni&s;hed with the knowledge requi&s;ite to our place and &s;tation: or, in
<PB N="9" REF="019699_0008_0FAC994B2388A630">
their actual exi&s;tence. The other e&s;&s;ential branch of hu|man perfection is compri&s;ed in affections corre&s;ponding to our perceptions: or, in the qualities of the heart. If the&s;e are proportioned, to a proper knowledge of the ob|jects of perceptions, it forms that amiable and worthy character, which comports with the nature and dignity of man&mdash;as he is related to his pre&s;ent and future &s;elf, to his fellow creatures and to his Creator.</P>
<P>THE duly proportioned knowledge of the objects of human perception, may be &s;tiled <HI>the natural beauty,</HI> or perfection, of man; and the corre&s;ponding affections of the heart, that which is <HI>humane, dome&s;tic, civil, moral,</HI> or <HI>evangelical:</HI> according to the qualities or relations of the objects, on which they terminate. And the oppo&s;ite to the&s;e, are the deformity of the under&s;tanding, and the heart. The beauty, or perfection of the heart, is evident|ly of the greate&s;t importance. Without this, the fine&s;t accompli&s;hments of the under&s;tanding are of little worth &mdash;Yea when connected with a heart, altogether deform|ed, they con&s;titute a character, utterly unworthy. And that deformity is even increa&s;ed, in con&s;equence of its connection with &s;uperior knowledge. For, it is the lan|guage of rea&s;on and revelation that, "to him who know|eth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is &s;in."</P>
<P>By &s;uitable exertions of the heart, the perceptions, and knowledge of the mind, are applied to their proper u&s;e, and rational exi&s;tence is both honorable and happy. But this can be a&s;&s;erted, with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety, of tho&s;e affections and exertions only, which are of the moral, or evangelical kind. The others, which have been men|tioned, have obtained the name of virtues, or perfections, on account of their coincidence with particular objects. A virtuous hu&s;band, friend, citizen or ruler, is denomi|nated from his acting agreeably to tho&s;e relations: with|out any re&s;pect to what he is, in regard to his more ex&s;ten&s;ive connections. And, it is very &s;uppo&s;able, that a per&s;on may be eminent in one, or more, of tho&s;e particu|lar
<PB N="10" REF="019699_0009_0FAC994BE3D86828">
virtues, and yet be utterly deformed, or vicious, in re&s;pect to his great and important relations, as the crea|ture of God, a rational and immortal being.</P>
<P>FROM hence it appears that though certain affections may be beautiful, in a &s;eparate view, and as proportioned to particular objects, or relations&mdash;the character, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of them, may be exceedingly deformed, on the whole: in con&s;equence of an oppo&s;ition of heart, to its more exten|&s;ive and important connections. And tho&s;e particular attachments, though agreeable in a &s;ubordination to &s;u|perior affections, &s;erve to heighten the deformity of the character, in a different connection. As we &s;ee men, eminent for &s;ome of the private virtues, often the mo&s;t inveterate and dangerous enemies to the &s;tate: when they are de&s;titute of public affection, and con&s;ider the intere&s;t of their particular connections, and that of the public, in oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>IN like manner, a per&s;on may be po&s;&s;e&s;ed of many of tho&s;e agreeable qualities, which are denominated vir|tues, and yet, through the influence of private affection, he may be oppo&s;ed to the honour of his Creator, and the intere&s;t of his fellow creatures. And tho&s;e very attach|ments, &s;o agreeable and u&s;eful, when &s;ubordinated to pub|lic affection may be &s;ub&s;ervient to that oppo&s;ition, and greatly enhance it. But that coincidence of affection, and exertion, to our great moral objects and relations, which obtains the name of <HI>moral virtue,</HI> or perfection in rational beings who have never tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and <HI>is evan|gelical virtue</HI> or holine&s;s in man, as corre&s;ponding to the go&s;pel revelation of &s;alvation.&mdash;<HI>That,</HI> is truly excel|lent, both as it is proportional to our mo&s;t exten&s;ive re|lations, and involves a proper affection to all particular objects, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, and as &s;ubordinate to the whole.</P>
<P>WERE we to apply the&s;e general principles to particu|lar characters, the evidence would appear to be &s;till more
<PB N="11" REF="019699_0010_0FAC994CA2B51220">
deci&s;ive. The great law of religion, in reference to our duty to God, our Creator, is &s;ummed up in that reveren|tial and practical affection, which is proportioned to our utmo&s;t ability. In relation to our fellow men, we are to love our neighbours as our&s;elves&mdash;their happine&s;s being of equal importance with our own. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the le&s;s good is to give way to the greater, the private to the public, and the intere&s;t of all finite, created beings, &s;hould be &s;ubordinated to the infinite and uncreated Ori|ginal of all. To man, as related to his pre&s;ent, and future &s;elf, it is the voice of rea&s;on and revelation&mdash;"Do thy&s;elf no harm." He is directed to &s;eek that happine&s;s, which comports with the dignity and importance of his exi&s;tence as a man.&mdash;A happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ting in union to his Creator, and to his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>THUS the great principles of rea&s;on, and revelation, form a mo&s;t beautiful and harmonious &s;y&s;tem. And the man, who is practically conformed to them, is po&s;&s;e&s;ed of the excellent qualities con&s;tituting that good character, which is repre&s;ented by the precious ointment, and is declared to excel it.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the chri&s;tian religion, as a &s;cheme adapt|ed to the ca&s;e of lap&s;ed creatures, we &s;hall find a no le&s;s beautiful harmony in its &s;everal parts&mdash;to their re&s;pective objects, to each other, and to the whole.</P>
<P>THIS divine &s;y&s;tem is con&s;tituted of two great branches. The fir&s;t, is a &s;upernatural revelation of the way of par|don and &s;alvation for &s;inners of mankind, through the me|diation and atonement of Chri&s;t; who is "God mani|fe&s;t in the fle&s;h." An atonement every way &s;uitable to the perfection of God, both as it exhibits the original ex|cellence of his character and government, and prepares the way for the fulle&s;t manife&s;tation of them, to the rati|onal creation, in the actual recovery, and &s;alvation, of &s;inners.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="019699_0011_0FAC994D62B37028">THE other branch, of the chri&s;tian revelation, contains what man is to believe and do, in reference to this reve|lation&mdash;the whole train of chri&s;tian graces and exertions, which corre&s;pond to his condition as a &s;inner, to his re|lations to God, as Creator, Redeemer, Sanctifier and Judge&mdash;to mankind, and to his own pre&s;ent and future exi&s;tence. The&s;e, fitly expre&s;&s;ed, in a life of chri&s;tian holine&s;s, form the character of "the man of God, fur|ni&s;hed to every good work." Each of the&s;e is excellent in it&s;elf, and as connected with the re&s;t. And all of them, collectively viewed, and rai&s;ed to their proper &s;tandard, form the chri&s;tian for that &s;tate of perfection to which he is redeemed; and prepare him to fill a place in that church of the fir&s;t-born, of which he is a member.</P>
<P>So little cau&s;e love the oppo&s;ers of chri&s;tianity to re|ject it, as a &s;cheme unworthy of God, and repugnant to the dictates of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy. It was, long &s;ince, ob&s;erved by a great ma&s;ter of rea&s;on, that "true and deep philo&s;ophy always leads men to a profound admi|ration of <HI>the fir&s;t cau&s;e.</HI>" It may be added, that this pro|found admiration will be abundantly increa&s;ed by a pro|per view of that great fir&s;t cau&s;e, as di&s;played in the chri&s;|tian revelation. It is a <HI>minute philosophy only</HI> which leads men to reject this divine &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>WE now proceed to the next branch of our &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider the de&s;tructive influence of &s;olly, when mixed with a good name.</P>
<P>THAT we may under&s;tand the force and propriety of the compari&s;on implied in the text, it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that one e&s;&s;ential excellence of the precious oint|ment refered to, con&s;i&s;ted in its fragrant and reviving &s;mell.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. i.3.</NOTE> The de&s;ructive influence of the dead fly, con|&s;i&s;ted in its taking away the &s;weet &s;avour of the oint|ment,
<PB N="13" REF="019699_0012_0FAC994E22788A08">
or in cau&s;ing it to &s;mell di&s;agreeably. By its pu|tre&s;action a poi&s;onous, as well as offen&s;ive, quality was al|&s;o diffu&s;ed through the compo&s;ition. And as this &s;weet and refre&s;hing ointment, would become di&s;agreeable, and de&s;tructive, by the mixture of the dead fly&mdash;&s;o the mo&s;t re&s;pectable character may loo&s;e its lu&s;tre, and be covered with di&s;grace, by the mixture of folly.</P>
<P>THAT the repre&s;entation may be more fully under|&s;tood, it may be farther ob&s;erved, that the term <HI>folly,</HI> as u&s;ed by this in&s;pired writer, is not re&s;trained to its prima|ry &s;ignification, to denote a de&s;titution of rational percep|tions, or an imbecility of intellect&mdash;Perfons of this de&s;cription cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in reputation for wi&s;dom and honour.</P>
<P>IT will likewi&s;e appear, by an examination of the pa&s;|&s;ages where this and other like terms are u&s;ed, that they are e&s;pecially de&s;igned to expre&s;s the quality and charac|ter of tho&s;e who neglect the proper application of their intellectual powers, or u&s;e them for oppo&s;ite and de&s;truc|tive ends. In this &s;en&s;e the term <HI>folly</HI> is to be under&s;tood in the pa&s;&s;age before us.</P>
<P>ONCE more, it mu&s;t be remembered, that the charac|ter mentioned, in the text, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be eminent. It belongs to &s;uch as are "in reputation, for wi&s;dom and honour." The a&s;&s;ertion might be illu&s;trated by an ap|plication to particular in&s;tances, of the mixture of folly, in a character otherwi&s;e reputable. The expre&s;&s;ions of a bad heart reproach the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation. And, folly is the rever&s;e of <HI>that wi&s;dom</HI> which is the honour of a vir|tuous character, in the various applications of the expre&s;|&s;ion: &s;ome of which have been named already.</P>
<P>A PERSON po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, even the be&s;t, intellectual ac|compli&s;hments, but the reverie of what he ought to be in the &s;everal relations of human life, and his connections in &s;ociety, is de&s;titute of the whole train of virtues; and his
<PB N="14" REF="019699_0013_0FAC994F0459E828">
character &s;ends forth an offen&s;ive &s;avour. This will be evident in real life: it is true of a hu&s;band and father, de&s;titute of conjugal and paternal affection&mdash;a nominal patriot, void of public &s;pirit&mdash;a judge, under the blinding influence of the love of money&mdash;and a rich man, de&s;titute of compa&s;&s;ion and liberality to the poor. Men, de&s;titute of the virtues &s;uitable to their particular conditions and re|lations, and under the influence of the oppo&s;ite vices, are the objects of ju&s;t abhorrence, in proportion to their op|portunity to be u&s;eful, to the eminence of their abilities and &s;tations.</P>
<P>THIS truth will be &s;till more obvious by applying it to the great moral objects, and relations, of man. By a &s;ingle fault, the mo&s;t awful ruin is diffu&s;ed through the human race. In place of that holy affection, to the Mo&s;t High, and to our brethren of mankind, which is &s;uitable to our nature and relations, and is our highe&s;t perfection; &s;elfi&s;h propen&s;ities have the dominion in the human heart, and "all men &s;eek their own." This is the general &s;ource of ruin to mankind. From hence, as their proper fountain, proceed, the private and public quarrels, the cruel wars and &s;laughters, which have filled our world&mdash; all the oppre&s;&s;ions and per&s;ecutions which, under various pretences, have &s;pread de&s;olation through the earth. The wide-&s;preading ruin has diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through all ages, all nations, and cla&s;&s;es of mankind. It has infected all degrees of &s;ociety, from the meane&s;t cottages, to the mo&s;t magnificent empires.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of pa&s;t ages, and kingdoms, will atte&s;t the truth of the&s;e observations, and general experience will confirm them. This dead fly, with its malignant infec|tion, enters the retirements of dome&s;tic quiet, and di&s;|turbs the &s;weet enjoyment of its tender friend&s;hips; and, in many in&s;tances, utterly de&s;troys them. It even &s;ets a man at variance with him&s;elf, and the conflict u&s;ually i&s;|&s;ues in his falling a prey to this baneful pa&s;&s;ion. To this
<PB N="15" REF="019699_0014_0FAC994FA25BB720">
mu&s;t be traced, <HI>&s;uicide it&s;elf,</HI> that mo&s;t unnatural of all the crimes of wretched mortals.</P>
<P>FINALLY, this &s;ets man at oppo&s;ition to his Maker, and leads him to reject the proffered grace and &s;alvation of the go&s;pel, procured and offered by the great Redeemer&mdash;and thus to plunge him&s;elf into the mo&s;t agravated, and remedile&s;s ruin. But for this, how happy were the lot of men! united to their Creator, to each other, and to them&s;elves; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of intellectual and other endowments, &s;u&s;&s;icient for the &s;ublime&s;t pur&s;uits and en|joyments, in a reciprocation of benevolent exertions, and in united reverential love and obedience, to the fountain of good.</P>
<P>BUT it is time to di&s;mi&s;s this gloomy &s;ide of human na|ture, and of our &s;ubject, and proceed to the concluding branch of it.</P>
<P N="3">III. IN an application, of the general maxim, to par|ticular characters.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent joyful anniver&s;ary, and this re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly, invite us to apply the &s;ubject to the intere&s;ting concerns of juri&s;-prudence and civil government. The gentlemen of the two hou&s;es of A&s;&s;embly, are the per&s;ons pointed out in the text, elected to their re&s;pective pla|ces of honour and reputation, by the <HI>unpurcha&s;ed, un&s;oli|cited</HI> votes of the freemen of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>IN a con&s;titution like our's, nothing but di&s;tingui&s;hed merit can be a recommendation to public office. It is tho&s;e, who are thus cho&s;en, who are in reputation for wi&s;dom and honour. Happy indeed! if no dead fly be ever found in this venerable "a&s;&s;embly of wife men." In the pre&s;ent application of the &s;ubject, we have only to &s;hew, that each branch of the legi&s;lature, and admini&s;tra|tion, mu&s;t be compo&s;ed of men equal in ability, and rec|titude of di&s;po&s;ition, to the importance of their &s;tation.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="019699_0015_0FAC9950681D68C0">As the object of government is the good of &s;ociety, it is natural to remark, that the rulers of a &s;tate &s;hould have a thorough knowledge of its intere&s;ts, on the whole. A &s;uperficial rea&s;oner in politics, is a very bad &s;tate&s;man. Such an one will often pur&s;ue &s;ome trifling intere&s;t of the &s;tate, real or imaginary, to the neglect and hazard of its greate&s;t, and mo&s;t la&s;ting emolument.</P>
<P>IF I rightly apprehend the nature of our con&s;titution, the honorable members of the Upper Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, be&s;ide acting as a&s;&s;i&s;tants to <HI>his Excellency,</HI> are repre&s;enta|tives of the &s;tate, <HI>at large.</HI> To the&s;e, in particular, it is given in charge "<HI>that the commonwealth receive no dam|age.</HI>" The gentlemen of the Lower Hou&s;e, &s;tand in much the &s;ame relation to their re&s;pective corporations, as the honourable council, to the whole &s;tate. In legis|lation and government, the intere&s;t of each corporation is to be regarded individually, and as connected with that of the &s;tate&mdash;in &s;uch a manner as to con&s;titute a common good, in which each town and, as far as po&s;&s;ible, each individual, &s;hall find it to be his intere&s;t to unite. This common good of the &s;tate, mu&s;t al&s;o be pur&s;ued in a man|ner coinciding with the intere&s;t of the confederacy at large.</P>
<P>THE members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives ought to have a good acquaintance, at lea&s;t, with the re&s;pective intere&s;ts of their own corporations, and to know how to promote them by the wi&s;e&s;t means, in con&s;i&s;tence with the common good of the &s;tate. The honourable mem|bers of the Council &s;hould have a &s;till more exact and exten&s;ive knowledge of the public intere&s;t, in its &s;everal branches, as they are guardians to the whole &s;tate&mdash;and &s;hould know how to &s;ecure and promote its welfare, &s;o as to produce the greate&s;t quantity of good, to each branch, and to the whole. And, as &s;hall mo&s;t exactly coincide with the intere&s;t of the United States&mdash;and bear a friend|ly a&s;pect to the good of &s;ociety, and mankind, at large.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="019699_0016_0FAC995123460780">IT is the part of the accompli&s;hed legi&s;lator to inve&s;ti|gate the be&s;t intere&s;t of each cla&s;s of &s;ociety, and ri&s;e, by ju&s;t gradations, in his plans and &s;y&s;tem, from parts to the whole; till he fix a common good, compri&s;ing the wel|fare of his &s;ubjects, as a body, and this, in con&s;i&s;tence with the intere&s;t of mankind. Such may the legi&s;lature of Connecticut be, and adopt the wi&s;e&s;t plans to promote its true intere&s;t, and to advance the pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s and glory of the United States; as a con&s;ede|rate republic, acting on the great theatre of the world, ranking with other nations, and having, in various re&s;|pects, a common intere&s;t with them; and, involving the happine&s;s, or mi&s;ery, of the many unborn millions who are to &s;ucceed us; and fill our exten&s;ive territory with, flouri&s;hing &s;ettlements: who&s;e it will be to complete the glorious fabric of liberty and equal government, founded by the wi&s;dom of our venerable &s;enators, and cemented by the blood of our &s;ons and brothers.</P>
<P>SUCH, and &s;o great, are the events connected with the pre&s;ent day. It is even an aera pregnant with the fate of a world! Where then, it will be a&s;ked, is the wi&s;dom, not more than human, which is equal to the importance of legi&s;lation and government, in founding this ri&s;ing empire? In this, however, as in other branches of practical know|ledge, though the highest degree of perfection can not be obtained, the man who would de&s;erve to be in reputation for wi&s;dom and honour, mu&s;t climb the lofty &s;teep of knowledge, in his profe&s;&s;ion, with unabating a&s;&s;iduity, and approach, as near as po&s;&s;ible, to the unattainable height.</P>
<P>THE other accompli&s;hment of the good legi&s;lator, and which renders him worthy of the highe&s;t re&s;pect, is exer|tion for the public intere&s;t, proportionate to his abilities. Without this, the greate&s;t &s;kill in juri&s;-prudence and civil government, will be vain. Indeed, knowledge, howe|ver nece&s;&s;ary, derives its importance from its connection
<PB N="18" REF="019699_0017_0FAC9951E41EF6A8">
with exertions, for the good of &s;ociety. And, unconnect|ed with a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;uch exertions, in a ruler, it may produce con&s;equences&mdash;fatal to the &s;tate. The public man mu&s;t be like the excellent Centurion, who had the te&s;timony of the Jews that he loved their nation.&mdash;Or, like the celebrated Emperor who, when a &s;ingle day had pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed without any particular in&s;tance of benificent exer|tion, lamented &s;aying, "I have lo&s;t a day."</P>
<P>WHO can &s;ufficiently revere the venerable patriot, who&s;e life is devoted to the &s;ervice of his country, and of man|kind?&mdash;From determination of the human mind, which is univer&s;al, this character has been the admiration of all nations, and cla&s;&s;es of men. "Ble&s;&s;ed art thou, O land, when thy king is the &s;on of nobles, and thy princes eat in due &s;eason, for &s;trength, and not for drunkennefs."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;tcs x.17.</NOTE> Here is full &s;cope for the collected wi&s;dom and virtue of our venerable A&s;&s;embly!

<P>AMONG the&s;e, and at their head, we behold, with thankful prai&s;e to <HI>the great Pre&s;erver,</HI> &s;afe from the perils of the war, "The Hero who redeemed our land!"&mdash; From the mid&s;t of ten thou&s;and dangers, re&s;tored to the bo&s;om of peace, and dome&s;tic felicity&mdash;Above the wi&s;h for other honours than tho&s;e which his di&s;tingui&s;hed vir|tue has &s;ecured.&mdash;Happy in the &s;afety of his country, like the parent cla&s;ping his dear child, ju&s;t &s;natched from the jaws of death.</P>
<P>WHAT is all tin&s;eled greatne&s;s of haughty mon|archy, compared with the meek maje&s;ty, the &s;weet and dignified &s;erenity of that heroic brea&s;t|&s;oftened with the mo&s;t tender &s;entiments of humanity! con&s;cious of his own

<P>SUCH are the &s;weet rewards of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit.&mdash; May tho&s;e which are far greater and more la&s;ting attend <HI>the illu&s;trious</HI> WASHINGTON.&mdash;May he be the care of heaven, the highly favoured &s;ubject of the King of Kings. &mdash;May he grow old in con&s;cious peace with God, and the &s;weet &s;en&s;ibility of chri&s;tian con&s;olation.

<P>THE &s;ubject opens an extended field, for u&s;eful and en|tertaining reflections, which will readily occur to the feel|ing mind, and &s;hall not, therefore, be particularly named.

<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>THROUGH the good hand of our God upon us, in the peace of 1783, our freedom and independence are recog|nized, by the Briti&s;h court.&mdash;We rank among other na|tions.&mdash;Have an immen&s;e territory, extending through a variety of climates.&mdash;A wide field is opened for the cul|tivation of the arts of peace&mdash;An opportunity for perfect|ing and perpetuating the mo&s;t happy con&s;titution of go|vernment, in the federal union. And, by the divine ble&s;|sing on proper civil and military di&s;cipline, we &s;hall be &s;ecure from the attacks, or, at lea&s;t, from the ravages of an enemy.</P>
<P>WHAT remains then, but that we take the cup of &s;alva|tion, and call on God&mdash;thankfully accept his ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings, and improve them&mdash;to be happy our&s;elves, and to leave the invaluable inheritance to po&s;terity? To this we have motives the mo&s;t numerous and weighty, but above all, we owe it to that omnipotent goodne&s;s&mdash;that God of grace, "who ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whom&s;oever he plea&s;eth," and who hath cau&s;ed his tender mercy to triumph over all our unwor|thine&s;s</P>
<P>THAT we may enjoy the proffered ble&s;&s;ings, much is yet to be done.&mdash;The various and complicated intere&s;ts of the &s;tate are to be fixed and &s;ecured.&mdash;The energy of
<PB N="23" REF="019699_0022_0FAC9956054964C0">
government, en&s;eebled by the revolution, and other cau|ses is to be re&s;tored&mdash;the principles of the union im|proved, and confirmed&mdash;the public credit e&s;tablished&mdash;and the whole &s;y&s;tem of the finances placed on a wi&s;e and re&s;pectable footing.</P>
<P>AMONG the many &s;ubjects which will engage the at|tention of the legi&s;lature the following de&s;erve particular attention. That, in the weighty &s;ubject of legi&s;lation, whatever &s;tatutes may be requi&s;ite, &s;hould be founded on principles of private and public ju&s;tice and utility, combining, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the intere&s;t of individuals with that of the public.&mdash;Laws &s;hould be plain, &s;imple, and but few:&mdash;Would rulers wi&s;h to govern well, they will not attempt to govern too much.</P>
<P>YOUR honours will not be unmindful of the va&s;t im|portance of the executive branch. In particular, that your Judges are men of the fir&s;t character, for wi&s;dom, and unbia&s;&s;ed rectitude of heart&mdash;well acquainted with the laws of the &s;tate, and with the principles and &s;pirit of law in general. And, who are exemplary for tho&s;e vir|tues, which give energy to their determinations.</P>
<P>As the &s;ame cour&s;e of <HI>external conduct,</HI> which flows from a heart animated by the &s;pirit of true religion&mdash;and, as &s;uch, is evangelical obedience&mdash;is, in many re&s;pects, e&s;|&s;ential to the well being of &s;ociety:&mdash;<HI>In this la&s;t view</HI> it is the proper object of civil government. While, there|fore, it is remembered that Chri&s;t's kingdom "is not of this world," and as fuch "calls no man mailer," it is proper to ob&s;erve that <HI>the manners</HI> of the people mu&s;t be formed by education and government. Admitting that an exact determination of the boundaries between the rights of con&s;cience, and of the magi&s;trate may be diffi|cult, in &s;ome ca&s;es&mdash;the mo&s;t important and practical principles, on this &s;ubject, are extremely plain; and are admitted by the mo&s;t enlightened, of every denomination, as e&s;&s;ential to good order and happine&s;s in &s;ociety. Your

honors, &s;en&s;ible of the importance of the general princi|ple, will apply it in your wi&s;dom for the good of this people.</P>
<P>AMOMG the many vices, which tend to the ruin of in|dividuals and society, perhaps none are more fatal than tho&s;e of needle&s;s law&s;uits, and the intemperate u&s;e of &s;trong drinks. The expence of the&s;e destructive practices is the lea&s;t of their evils; but even this is not incon&s;iderable. It would be easy to &s;hew, were it needful, that the u&s;ele&s;s con&s;umption of time end money, in the&s;e &s;ocial vices, far exceeds the whole co&s;t of &s;upporting civil government, and the public worship of God. But were this all, it would be comparatively, trifling.&mdash;What is of, almo&s;t infinitely, greater importance is the de&s;truction of virtue and good manners; which is hereby effected, in individ|uals, in families, and the public. "Who hath wo? Who hath &s;orrow? Who hath contention? Who hath babbling? Who hath wounds without cau&s;e ? Who hath redne&s;s of eyes?&mdash;They who tarry long at the wine: they who go to &s;eek much wine."&mdash;At the la&s;t it biteth like a &s;erpent and &s;tingeth like an adder."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proverbs, xxiii. 29&mdash;32.</NOTE></P>
<P>YOUR honours will be happy if you can &s;ave this peo|ple from that gulph of ruin. We rejoice that our rulers &s;o generally remember the excellent maxim, which king Lemuel received from his mother. "It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings, to drink wine, nor for princes &s;trong drink: left they drink and forget the law, and pervert the judgement of any of the afflicted.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Proverbs, xxxi. 4, 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE intere&s;t of education, and literature in general, are humbly recommended to this honorable A&s;&s;embly. The Univer&s;ity in the &s;tate, under the au&s;pices of a gen|tleman who&s;e prai&s;e is far extended in the religious and literary world&mdash;flouri&s;hing in numbers, in literature and reputation&mdash;is, however, expo&s;ed to many inconveni|encies;
<PB N="25" REF="019699_0024_0FAC995727DA2DD0">
e&s;pecially from the want of proper edifices to contain the &s;tudents under the eye of the executive autho|rity, and funds to &s;upport &s;ome additional profe&s;&s;or&s;hips. The paternal attention of this venerable A&s;&s;embly, is re|quested to that important in&s;titution; where &s;o many of us have received our education: in which we have a com|mon intere&s;t, and where we wi&s;h that our &s;ons may be united as a band of brothers, in treading the delightful paths of &s;cience, and forming for public u&s;efulne&s;s&mdash; when we &s;hall &s;leep in the du&s;t of death.</P>
<P>YOUR honours are no &s;trangers to the pre&s;ent alarm|ing &s;tate of public credit, and the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity for the adoption of deci&s;ive mea&s;ures to re&s;tore it. That our foreign and dome&s;tic creditors mu&s;t be &s;atisfied is not problematical&mdash;it is certain. Our national character is at &s;take, with all the invaluable ble&s;&s;ings of freedom and independence. In vain have the&s;e been purcha&s;ed, at &s;uch an expence of blood and trea&s;ure, unle&s;s our national credit be &s;upported.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;ubject no le&s;s important than difficult. It is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee <HI>what will not</HI> &s;ucceed, but hard to de|termine <HI>what will.</HI> An attempt to remedy the evil by a new emi&s;&s;ion of paper currency would, no doubt, come under the former de&s;cription, and be making bad wor&s;e. Our public &s;ecurities, of every denomination, are of this kind, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the recommending qualities which could attend a new paper currency, de&s;titute of a fund for its redemption. But, like the thin ears, and lean kine, in the dream of Egypt's king, they have already devoured the fat and full ears of gold and &s;ilver with which our country abounded at the peace in 1783&mdash;and they are nothing better but are, continental money ex|cepted, <HI>&s;uch as were never &s;een in all the land of America for badne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>THIS, however, is not the fault of any cla&s;s of men, whether rulers or &s;ubjects, but of the times. It is the re|&s;ult

of a combination of circum&s;tances attending the late revolution, in connexion with the imperfection common to man. How to remedy the evil is the que&s;tion.&mdash;The collected wi&s;dom of this A&s;&s;embly, and of the united Re|public, will be &s;trenuously, and, we tru&s;t, &s;ucce&s;sfully, employed in devi&s;ing means to re&s;tore our credit, as a &s;tate and nation.&mdash;<HI>These,</HI> it is not the province of the &s;peaker to &s;ugge&s;t: but it is easy to obe&s;erve, that our re|&s;ources are not incon&s;iderable, Be&s;ide our unlocated lands, a future revenue of immen&s;e value, the fruits of a well directed industry and oeconomy.&mdash;Our advantage for &s;hip|building, for trade, and, e&s;pecially, for the fi&s;h|ery.&mdash;With other &s;ources of private and public wealth may be directed in &s;uch a manner as to fix, and perpetu|ate, the public credit.</P>
<P>YOUR honours would be happy if you could devi&s;e &s;ome better expedient, than has yet been adopted, for <HI>the gradual, but total abolition of &s;lavery</HI>; and, in the mean time, protect the friendle&s;s Africans among us from a|bu&s;e, on the one hand, and, on the other, &s;ecure &s;ociety from injury by improper and ill-timed manumi&s;&s;ions.</P>

But the mea&s;ures, then adopted, are evidently inadequate, and attended with con&s;equences unfriendly to &s;ociety, and to them. In each of the&s;e views, the &s;ubject calls for public attention: but, immediate danger being pa&s;t, it engages little notice.&mdash;And, not a few of the citizens of the United States are returning, "like the dog to his vomit," to that dreadful infraction of the law of nature and of God, the practice of &s;tealing their brethren of the human race, and &s;elling them. While many Briti&s;h &s;ubjects and &s;ome of the fir&s;t dignitaries of their e&s;tab|li&s;hed church, are pleading the cau&s;e of tho&s;e friendle&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ed &s;trangers, with a noblene&s;s of &s;entiment

As the members of that &s;ociety are numerous and re&s;|pectable, the publication of the Sermon is no &s;mall indication of the humane &s;entiments which are prevailing in Great-Britain, on this &s;ubject.</NOTE></P>
<P>COULD your honours do any thing effectual, however the intere&s;ted and unfeeling might oppo&s;e, humanity would approve, with the mo&s;t friendly ardour.

<P>MUCH RESPECTED FATHERS AND BRETHREN,</P>
<P>THOUGH we have no &s;hare in legi&s;lation and govern|ment, a large field is open, in which we are to diffu&s;e the &s;weet perfume of that mo&s;t fragrant compo&s;ition, <HI>the chri&s;|tian religion,</HI> which we are to preach to others, and prac|tice our&s;elves. Nothing is more obvious than that the &s;pirit and in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel bear a friendfy a&s;pect

to &s;ociety and government. And that, in &s;uch a manner, as is true of no other religious &s;y&s;tem:&mdash;for no other, teaches its votaries to place their felicity in the public good, and to think and act on the extended &s;cale of the mo&s;t perfect general happine&s;s. But chri&s;tianity not on|ly <HI>teaches,</HI> but <HI>in&s;pires</HI> its &s;ubjects with this truly noble liberality of &s;entiment and affection. It expands the heart of each individual to embrace the good of all, and to re&s;t ultimately, in the perfection of the divine glory, and of the felicity of God's kingdom. And, &s;urely, a heart thus dilated with public affection, can not fail to exert it&s;elf for the good of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>WE are to teach our people "the whole council of God," as it re&s;pects doctrinal, experimental, and practi|cal chri&s;tianity.&mdash;But let it &s;uffice, on the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion, to ob&s;erve, that we muft "put them in mind to be &s;ubject to principalities and powers, to obey magi&s;trates, to be ready to every good work, to &s;peak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, &s;hewing all meekne&s;s to all men."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus iii.1, 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>BY in&s;truction and example, we are to &s;hew them the way to exhibit the amiable beauties of pure chri&s;tianity, in the exertions of well directed benevolence and public &s;pirit, and a becoming di&s;charge of all the relative duties. From us, they &s;hould learn the &s;weet plea&s;ure of dome&s;tic virtue and religion, in all its branches. And how good and plea&s;ant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. Society is con&s;tituted of families, and from them, it re|ceives its complexion.&mdash;In this way let us teach our peo|ple to reverence the laws, the rulers, and judges of the &s;tate. And, above all, to reverence our great Creator and Redeemer, and imitate his goodne&s;s&mdash;to be fathers to the poor&mdash;the friends of &s;trangers&mdash;to wipe the tear from the orphan's eye&mdash;and cau&s;e the widow's heart to &s;ing for joy.</P>
