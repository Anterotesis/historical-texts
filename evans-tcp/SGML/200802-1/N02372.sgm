<P>IT is in my Mind to write &s;omething as a Te&s;timony concerning my dear and well-beloved Friend <HI>Eliza|beth Stirredge,</HI> decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>She was one who received the Truth in the Love of it in her young Years, as I have heard from her own Mouth, and as in her following Book is more fully related: Wherefore I need &s;ay no more of that, but de&s;cend to write &s;omething concerning her, during the Time of my Acquaintance with her, which was about Fifteen Years.</P>
<P>She lived for that Time about Se|ven Miles from us, and &s;ometimes would come to vi&s;it our Meeting at <HI>Watford,</HI> whom I and many more were glad to &s;ee, &s;he being one whom the Lord was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow a Ta|lent and Gift of the Mini&s;try upon (which he is plea&s;ed to give unto both Male and Female, they being all one

<P>It was her Lot, many Times, when &s;he came to our Meeting, to lodge at my Hou&s;e, (my dear Mother <HI>Han|nah Neale</HI> and &s;he being very intimate Friends, and heartily loving each o|thers Company) and indeed her Com|pany I al&s;o loved, for it was plea&s;ant and delightful to the hone&s;t-hearted; and I may &s;ay, her Di&s;cour&s;e was edifying to me.</P>

after a very &s;trict Manner, &s;o that I can truly &s;ay, I was much a Strang|er unto the World, and its Ways. In my tender Years I was one of a &s;ad Heart, and much concerned and &s;ur|pri&s;ed with inward Fear what would become of me when I &s;hould die: And when my Lot was to be near any that would talk rudely, or &s;wear, or be overcome with &s;trong Drink, I dreaded to pa&s;s by them; and when I did hear it thunder, O the Dread and Terror that would fall upon me; and I would get the private&s;t Place that I could to mourn in &s;ecret, thinking the Lord would render Vengeance upon the Heads of the wicked. When I &s;aw the Fla&s;hes of Lightning, Oh! think I, whither &s;hall I go to hide my &s;elf from the Wrath of the dread|ful and terrible God? Thus was I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with my Soul's Concern, before I was ten Years of Age; I was &s;o filled with Fears and Doubts, that I could take no Delight in any thing of this World. And when I grew up to riper Years, I went to hear tho&s;e

Surely if it were po&s;&s;ible for me to have enjoyed all the World, I could freely have parted with it, for Peace, Comfort and Satisfaction for my poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul, that mourned as with|out Hope; and many a time, and many Hours have I been alone, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead|ing and mourning, when no Eye &s;aw me, nor Ear heard me, neither could I find comfort in Reading, becau&s;e it was a Book &s;ealed unto me.

<P>And under this exerci&s;e I grew very &s;ad, in&s;omuch that my Mother feared

I was going into a Con&s;umption, and greatly fear'd my Death; and would &s;ay to me, <HI>Can&s;t thou take Delight in nothing?

<P>Then did I fall down upon my Knees, to pray unto the Lord, with my Heart full of Sorrow, and the Tears running down my Face, and could not utter one Word; which

But it was the Ene|my's Work to per&s;wade me, there was none like unto me: And becau&s;e I could not pray in Words, as others could, and likewi&s;e under Afflictions, therefore the Lord had no Regard un|to me. But the Enemy is a Lyar, as ever, for the Lord was near me in every Exerci&s;e, and broke my Heart, and melted my Spirit, or el&s;e it would not have been &s;o with me.

and keep him in your Remembrance, and pray unto him in the inward of your Minds. Altho' you cannot utter one Word, know it a&s;&s;uredly, that he is near to help his afflicted Children at all Times, as they &s;tand in Need or him.

And in my Di&s;tre&s;s and Afflictions, wil|ling to have a little Re&s;t and Comfort, I lent out an Ear to the Enemy of my Soul, and let my Mind go forth after fine Clothes; but when it was drawn out, it went without Limit; and when

<P>But tho' he had drawn out my Mind, the Lord did not leave me; for I &s;hould many Times have a Concern upon my Mind what would become of me; and if at any Time I was drawn out into any Mirth or Laugh|ter, I &s;hould feel &s;omething &s;mite my Heart, and bring great Heavine&s;s over my Spirit; but I knew not what it was, and I little thought it was the Lord, who was ever good and gra|cious, kind, merciful, and &s;low to Anger, and not willing People &s;hould run into De&s;truction, nor peri&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002815_0028_0FE64364451D0D30">
I little thought he looked &s;o nar|rowly to my Ways; but &s;ince the Lord hath been plea&s;ed to open my Eyes, I can look back and admire his Goodne&s;s, and ble&s;&s;ed be his worthy Name, and the right Arm of his Strength, who hath early been my Guide, and kept me in great Part from running into the Evil of the World, which greatly attends young People. But ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Lord, he took me by the Hand, and led me when I knew not of it, in the Days of my tender Years; and if I had not hearkened unto the Enemy, my Con|dition had been well. But as &s;oon as he had drawn my Mind into Pride, and to take Delight in fine Clothes, it &s;oon became my Burden; for in a little Time after, the Lord in the Riches of his Love, was plea&s;ed to fit and furni&s;h his Faithful Servants, and painful Labourers, who&s;e Indu&s;triou&s;|ne&s;s the Lord greatly pro&s;pered, two Men of worthy Memory, dear <HI>John Audland,</HI> and <HI>John Camm,</HI> in 1654.

<P>After Meeting was over, I &s;epara|ted my &s;elf from my Company, and travelled alone two Miles, becau&s;e no Ear &s;hould hear me making my Moan unto the Lord; and out of the Bit|terne&s;s of my Spirit did I &s;ay, <HI>Lord, what &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?

<P>I thought I could have been con|tented; but it plea&s;ed the Lord to o|pen the Eyes of my Under&s;tanding, and to lead me by a Way that I knew not, and to begin the fir&s;t Day's Work in my Heart, <HI>which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as the Spirit of the Lord to move upon the Waters, and to divide the Light from the Darkne&s;s;</HI> and when the Separation was made, then could I &s;ee my Way in the Light, <HI>which was the Light unto</HI> David's <HI>Feet, and was a Lanthorn unto his Paths;</HI> and it will order every one's Goings aright, if they take Heed unto it.</P>

I was 21 Years of Age when I was in this Condition; but after Meeting was ended, I dreaded to go unto him, for I thought that he was one of a great di&s;cerning, and he would be &s;en&s;ible the Hardne&s;s of my Heart; and if he &s;hould Judge me, I &s;hould not be able to bear it; but yet I could not go a|way in Peace, until I had been with

<P>Oh! he was one that had good Tidings for me in that Day, and great Power was with his Te&s;timony at that very Time; for the Hardne&s;s was taken away, and my Heart was open|ed by that Ancient Power that opened the Heart of <HI>Lydia;</HI> everla&s;ting Prai&s;es be given unto him that &s;its upon the Throne for ever, who hath pre&s;erved me out of the Snares and &s;ubtil Con|trivances of the Adver&s;ary.</P>

Then the Power of the Lord fell upon me, and filled my Heart with a very dreadful Warning among&s;t them; tel|ling them, <HI>That it was in vain for them to be found &s;triving again&s;t the Lord, and his People; their Work would not pro&s;per; for the great God of Heaven and Earth would be too &s;trong for them.

<P>Therefore, my dear Children, re|member your latter End, and the Day of Account, and keep a Bridle to your Tongues; for he that knows not a Bridle to his Tongue, his Religion is vain.

took me from a Burial, and had me before them; the Manner of which, comes up before me at this Time.</P>
<P>It being my Lot to be at the Bu|rial of a Daughter of one profe&s;&s;ing Truth, where I had a Te&s;timony to the People, many being there of the Prie&s;t's Company, which greatly of|fended him. The next Week after, the Father of this young Woman dy|ing al&s;o; the Day of his Burial hap|ning on the very Day that &s;everal Ju|&s;tices were met at their Petty-Se&s;&s;ions, near the Burying-Place of Friends, they &s;ent a Warrant, with &s;ome Of|ficers, into our Burying-Yard, to bring away Preacher and Hearers (if any one there was, that did take upon them to preach) there being a great Concour&s;e of People, many coming in with the Officers, to &s;ee what they would do unto us; and a very great Company with the Corps. And no &s;ooner were we come into the Yard&punc; and the Multitude, but the Power of the Lord &s;eized upon me, and made me to tremble, that I could hardly

&s;tand on my Feet; but by taking hold on a Friend that was near me, I &s;aid, <HI>There is a Day coming, in the which, the God of Heaven and Earth will be too &s;trong for the &s;tout-hearted among&s;t you; therefore repent, and amend your Lives, while you have a Day, and a Time; for as the Tree falls, &s;o it li|eth, and as Death leaves, Judgment finds, for there is no Repentance in the Grave; therefore ha&s;ten, ha&s;ten to Re|pentance, and Amendment of Life, for the Great God of Heaven and Earth will thin this Nation, for the Peo|ple are too many that are &s;inning a|gain&s;t the Lord.</HI> This, and much more ran thro' me; for my Heart was opened, and my Spirit great|ly enlarged by the mighty Pow|er of the Lord, and drawn forth in Bowels of Love towards the People; for I &s;aw the Tears running down many Faces, and many &s;aid, they would never be again as they had been.

<PB N="91" REF="002815_0108_0FE64F0847CD1200">
open the Warrant, without rend|ing it, crying, <HI>Oh! that I had been twenty Miles from my Habitation, that I had not had a Hand in this Work this Day; pray don't you take it ill of me, for I am forced to it; you mu&s;t go with me before the Ju&s;tices, but I wi&s;h I had been farther off, then I had had no Hand in troubling of you, pray don't you be angry with me.</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>Don't be trou|bled &s;o much, I am not offended.

She &s;aid, There was a Day coming, in which the God of Heaven and Earth would be too &s;trong for the &s;tout-heart|ed among&s;t us; and proclaimed a Day of Mortality among&s;t us, and warned us to repent, and amend our Lives; &s;ure|ly it made my Heart to tremble.</HI> How!

Relea&s;e at that Time. The Ju&s;tice re|turning in again &s;aid, <HI>Pray Neighbour</HI> Stirredge <HI>go home about your Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> So I returned to my Habitation again, and had the Peace of the Lord in my Bo&s;om; everla&s;ting Prai&s;es be gi|ven to the Lord our God for ever.</P>
<P>But this wicked Prie&s;t after this Burial, went from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and threatned the People, <HI>That it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould co&s;t them Five Pound a-piece for going to hear the Quakers.</HI> And &s;ome being affrighted at his Threat|ning, asked him Forgivene&s;s; others &s;aid, they would go again.

For after he had &s;ent the Officers to our Meeting, which dealt roughly with us, by pulling and throwing, and threatning; all which did not content him. But a little after, as he was preaching in his Pulpit, he fell down dead, whil&s;t the Words were in his Mouth; as many of the Hea|rers being th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n and there pre&s;ent, de|clared unto me, that they thought he

would never have drawn Breath a|gain. But after a great a do, and all Means u&s;ed, that they could make U&s;e of, he a little recovered again. But, &s;aid the People, we hope it will be a Warning to him for to leave off per&s;ecuting his Neighbours. But it was not, for he was heard to &s;ay, <HI>That if he could but live to accompli&s;h that Work that he had began, he did not care if he died pre&s;ently.</HI> So he &s;eeing his Neighbours not forward in an&s;wering his Will to the full, he &s;ends to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> for <HI>John Hellier,</HI> with more of his Confederates, who was the great Per&s;ecutor at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> whom he thought did his Work to the full; for they came in with many Officers, into our Meeting at <HI>Chew-magna,</HI> Five Miles from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where we were &s;olemnly met together to wait upon the Great God of Heaven and Earth; they ru&s;hed in among&s;t us, and arre&s;t|ed us all in the King's Name, and left a Guard upon us, and went to the Prie&s;t's Hou&s;e to Din<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">r, and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d near two Hours; in which Time we

<P>So after they had fed to the full, and drank in Abundance, they brought with them Faggots of Wood from the Prie&s;ts, with a Hatchet, and great, Ax, and commanded the People to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t them.

threatning them to burn them; bringing &s;ome of them out, they &s;aid, <HI>We will make them a Warning to all o|thers, and make them repent that ever they were Quakers Ba&s;tards.</HI></P>
<P>Then they laid Hands on us, haling and dragging us along, beating &s;ome with a Cane, and hewing off the Legs of the Forms, and taking other Forms by the two Ends, and &s;o threw the <HI>Friends</HI> backwards that &s;ate thereon; often calling to our Neighbours to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t them.

<P><HI>John Hellier</HI> being the Head Man in this Work, our Headborough ask|ed him, <HI>What he &s;hould do with us?</HI> he replied, <HI>Have them away to Pri|&s;on pre&s;ently.</HI> The Day being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pent, and the Journey long, it be|ing Twenty and two Miles to the County Goal, he asked <HI>J.

put off his Hat, and thanked them, and &s;aid, <HI>It would add Years to his Life, now he &s;hould live in Peace.</HI> But take Notice how &s;hort his Days were.

Come, put your Hands to the Work, and your Shoul|ders to the Burden, and cry mightily unto the Lord to &s;pare a little, and give a little Time to renew your Strength in him, that you may do &s;omething for the Lord, tho' but at the la&s;t Hour; for &s;urely Friends, the la&s;t Hour to many is very near; and the long invited, if they mi&s;s of this Hour, they will never have ano|ther Hour to work for the living God; and therefore is my Soul concerned, and my Heart pained within me, and Shortne&s;s of Time is much before me, and therefore I beg it of you, that you will lay it to Heart, before it be too late, and con&s;ider how &s;oon the Lord can call for your Breath; for our Lives here are likened to the Flower of the Field, as the Lord &s;aid to his Prophet, when he &s;aid, <HI>What &s;hall I cry?

<P>Oh! the Lord grant me my Re|que&s;t, and bow his Ear to my Prayer; for I am very earne&s;t with the Lord, and my Heart is pained within me on your Behalf. Oh! it is you, it is you that &s;hould have been as <HI>Pillars in the Hou&s;e of the Lord,</HI> that the weak|e&s;t might have leaned upon you, that your Courage and Valour might have appeared in the Sight of the Weak, that they might have been encoura|ged by it, that the Strong and the Weak might have gone up together to the Mountain of the Hou&s;e of the Lord, where the Lord would have taught you of his Ways, and you might have walked in his Paths, and he would have fortified you with Might, Courage, Strength and Valour, and your Bow would have abode in his Strength, &s;o that you would have

Oh <HI>Friends!</HI> I can hardly write what ari&s;eth in my Heart, as touching this Matter; but in the Fear of the Lord, I have this to &s;ay, Your Eyes &s;hould have &s;een the Wonders of the Lord in a miraculous Manner, as they did that thus leaned upon the Lord, and tru&s;t|ed in his Strength, and believed in him, and then all Things were po&s;|&s;ible; and by obeying of the Com|mand of the Lord, the Walls of <HI>Je|richo</HI> fell: But if they had rea&s;oned with Fle&s;h and Blood, or thought the In&s;truments too mean, or con&s;ulted with Rea&s;oning, they had never &s;een the Power of the Lord to do his Work; neither &s;hall any now this Day, that rea&s;on with Fle&s;h and Blood:

<P>So, <HI>dear Friends,</HI> keep your Hearts with all Diligence; for out of it are the I&s;&s;ues of Life; for we all well know, that the People that live mo&s;t cha&s;te, keep neare&s;t to the Lord, and they that are neare&s;t, hear mo&s;t of his Coun&s;el: And truly <HI>Friends,</HI> the Time is at Hand, when all &s;hall be di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed for the Lord, and the mo&s;t Faith|ful will not &s;pare of the Heavenly Oyl; then it will be too late for any to go to buy. Oh! it often ri&s;eth in my Heart, that yet a little Time, and Time unto many will be no more, for which my Soul is more concern|ed, than for any outward Suffering; for, &s;urely <HI>Friends,</HI> it is in my Heart to believe, that the great God of Hea|ven and Earth, who hath been long provoked, and tried many Ways, and
