<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>IT is above Sixty years &s;ince Courts of Ju|dicature have been Erected in the Town of <HI>Ip&s;wich;</HI> yet was it never known in all that time any per&s;on Arraigned there for any Capital Offence. Which might ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the rea&s;on that &s;o ma|ny Thou&s;ands were there gathered, as was &s;carcely ever heard of or &s;een upon any occa|&s;ion in any part of <HI>New England.</HI> Which could not but put all &s;erious and thoughtful Spirits in mind of the Great and General A&s;&s;embly that will appear at the Great Day to receive their final Sentence: Which Mul|titude were gathered to behold the Tragical End of the per&s;on then Executed, which was attended with &s;o many &s;ignals of Divine Grace and Favour, as the following pages will give a more perfect and di&s;tinct Account of, which not to have publi&s;hed, would have been a concealing of the Di&s;plays of the De|clarative Prai&s;e and Glory of God; and a damp to the Encouragement of Paenitent Sin|ners to hope for Mercy at the la&s;t hour. The&s;e following Subjects that were handled on tho&s;e

Lecture Weeks when the Criminal was Tryed, Condemned, and afterwards Executed, appea|ring to be very &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion. And the Di&s;cour&s;es which were rai&s;ed from them being judged worthy of publication; not only to revive the memory of tho&s;e that were hap|py in hearing of them; but that all others, who may providentially come to the view of them, may be &s;tirred up to prai&s;e the Lord for his wonderful goodne&s;s, in making &s;uch an heinous Sinner &s;uch an In&s;tance of Converting Grace and Mercy: Neither &s;hall any need to que&s;tion the truth of the repentance of the per&s;on Condemned, &amp; after Executed, from the &s;hortne&s;s of the time of her Experiences: The Thief that Commenced Converted on the Cro&s;s (as was expre&s;&s;ed by him that Preach|ed on that occa&s;ion) is a proof of the po&s;&s;ibili|ty hereof; <HI>for with God all things are po&s;&s;ible:</HI> Seeing we read not any thing of his Conver&s;ion before he was Nailed thereon, but God (who&s;e gifts of Grace &amp; Mercy are free, and di&s;po&s;es of them, to whom, and at what time he plea&s;es, did ble&s;s the publick and pri|vate means that were u&s;ed, &s;o as to bring about this marvellous Change in this poor Creature, for the Exalting of the Riches of his Grace to mi&s;erable Sinners.

<P>THE Word of the Lord is in it &s;elf always precious, yet be&s;t e&s;teemed where and when there are few or no open Vi|&s;ions; therefore it is &s;aid when <HI>Samuel</HI> began to Prophe&s;y, <HI>the word of the Lord was precious in tho&s;e days,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3 1.

<P N="1">1. <HI>The weightine&s;s of the Subject on which the Sermons treats.</HI> It is no le&s;s then <HI>LIFE</HI> and <HI>DEATH</HI> is to be &s;et before you: which when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;et before <HI>I&s;rael, he call'd Heaven and Earth to Record, Deut.</HI> 30.19.

<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>What is Sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> In general, 'Tis the &s;werving or declining of the Nature or Act of the Rea&s;onable Creature from the Will and Law of the Creator: It is the Ha|bitual or Actual Exorbitancy, or Devi|ation of the Affections and Actions of man from the Commands of God. God is the la&s;t End, the End of all things. As he is <HI>Alpha,</HI> &s;o <HI>Omega,</HI> the Fir&s;t and La&s;t, Beginning and Ending. <HI>Of him and from him are all things,</HI> and al&s;o to him; from him as their Origi|nal, to him as their End. His Will therefore is the Creatures Rule. The Will that is In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eriour, is to be regulated b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Will of the Superiour: The will of the Father is the Rule of the Child: The Command of the Leader is the Rule of his Souldiers: The Supream Will is the Rule of that which is Subor|dinate. Hence the Will of God Revea|led is the &s;ole Rule and Law of our Inclinations, Di&s;po&s;itions and Actions. It is the right &s;traight line by which
<PB N="4" REF="001020_0016_0FAEE891A773BF28">
our whole cour&s;e &s;hould be ordered. Now any warping or turning from this line is Sin. The Statutes of the Lord are right, the ob&s;erving them is Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. The Conformity of our Nature, Powers, Faculties and Acts unto the Law of God; For Sin is a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.4. <HI>Who&s;oever com|mitteth &s;in Tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth the Law.</HI> A Con|cordance of our hearts and ways with the Law of God; This is Righteou&s;ne&s;s.

<P>Que&s;t. 2. <HI>What is Death?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> As Sin is the privation of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s in a Subject who&s;e it ought to be; &s;o Death is the privati|on of Happine&s;s in a Subject where it might be, or is capable of it: Death is the privation of Life. Now Life being the greate&s;t Natural Good, its put for all Good; and &s;o Death being the pri|vation
<PB N="5" REF="001020_0017_0FAEE8924BEF6798">
of it, and mo&s;t contrary to it, is the &s;umme and comprehen&s;e of all Evil; The lo&s;s of all that Happine&s;s and Good both of Soul and Body which man was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of here, and was to be commu|nicated to him afterwards: Likewi&s;e the &s;en&s;e of all that Evil which he is the Sub|ject of, both now and for ever.

The lo&s;s of External Good re+lating to the Body or Outward man, is a fruit and puni&s;hment of Sin: There had never been any want of the&s;e things, no poverty or indigency, had <HI>Adam</HI> re|main'd in Innocency. But Sin has de|prived man, not only of &s;elf perfections, but the excellency, &s;uitablene&s;s and &s;ub|jection of the Creatures to him.

How could <HI>Adam</HI> think, but that God who was his Law-giver, and had given him Law, would al&s;o be his Judge in inflicting the penalty due for the breach thereof, and that with|out mercy. No wonder then that <HI>Adam</HI> flees from the pre&s;ence of God.

<P>When we read the former part of the Text, with <HI>Adam</HI> we may be ready to flee away from God, from his Pre&s;ence; we ju&s;tly dread this voice of God, this word, <HI>THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH.</HI> But if we &s;tay a little, and hear further what God the Lord will &s;peak, he &s;peaks <HI>Peace unto the Chil|dren of men, be turns that Death into Life.

<P><HI>That there is Life for Sinners: viz. Life Eternal.</HI> Under which general term is comprehended every good thing: All that is needful or de&s;irable, what&s;oever makes to the well being or perfection of a man. Death is the &s;umm and comprehen&s;e of all Evil, Life is al&s;o the comprehen&s;e of all Good. Particu|larly, the Life here &s;poken of is Eternal Life, and by it we may under&s;tand the Life of Grace and of Glory. The&s;e are not di&s;tinct in kind, there is only a gra|dual and circum&s;tantial difference be|tween them. The truth of the Propo|&s;ition may be &s;een both in general and particular. There is Life for Sinners&punc; this is the voice of the Go&s;pel. The Law brings news of Death, the Go&s;pel
<PB N="45" REF="001020_0057_0FAEEC46001600D0">
brings the glad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">idings of life. The Law concludes all under Death, the Go&s;pel excludes none from Life; &s;tretching forth its Arms to all that will receive it. The Law brings Condemnation, the Go&s;pel Salvation. The Law ca&s;ts all in|to Hell, and as <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Dives, between us and you there is a great Gulph fixed, &s;o that there is no pa&s;&s;ing from one to the other.</HI> Yet now we may truly &s;ay, that this Gulph is pa&s;&s;ible, or here is a pa&s;&s;age from Hell to Heaven. The Gulph is exceeding great, Heaven and Hell are far a&s;under, Death and Life, there is a va&s;t di&s;tance between them; but yet there is a pa&s;&s;age <HI>from Death to Life,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.14. A Sinner may be brought out of the belly of Hell, as &s;ometimes <HI>Jonah</HI> out of the Whales Belly. Indeed the Law leaves us without hope or help, like <HI>Jo&s;ephs</HI> Brethren, it ca&s;ts into the Pit, &amp; does not regard our crying: But the Go&s;pel lets down tho&s;e Cords by which we may be drawn out thence. The Pit indeed is deep, but there is an Infinite Arm of Grace that can fathom &amp; reach to the bottom of it, and bring us out of it. A Sinners Chains and Fetters may

be broken, and made to fall from him; The Pri&s;on doors are &s;et open for man to come out; yea, the door of Heaven is now open, the Gate of Life, wherein who&s;oever will, may enter, and Live for ever.</P>
<P>Further to illu&s;trate this, Con&s;ider two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Life is tendered unto all.</HI> The Go&s;|pel is univer&s;al in its offers: <HI>Who&s;oever believeth&punc; and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved</HI>; according to our Saviours Commi&s;&s;ion to the Preachers of it, <HI>Matt.</HI> 28.19. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15. Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, both the Word and the Spirit &s;ays, <HI>Who&s;oever will let him come &amp; take of the waters of Life freely.</HI> Rev. 22.17.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Life is actually be&s;towed and conferred upon many, even on all that embrace the Go&s;|pel.</HI> There is Grace enough for all in the Go&s;pel, but all will not accept of it. There are tho&s;e that will not come unto Chri&s;t that they might have li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; <HI>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God</HI>; and Heirs of his Kingdom; Hei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of Life and Glory. So <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians, You hath he quickned who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.</HI> Though Death has pa&s;&s;ed up|on
<PB N="47" REF="001020_0059_0FAEEC47140CFAF8">
all becau&s;e all have &s;inned; yet many are already pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life.</P>
<P>If any ask, <HI>What Life is</HI>?</P>
<P>They mu&s;t tarry till they come to Heaven for a full An&s;wer of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his Que&s;ti|on. No man living can here tell what Life is. Angels know it, but can't im|part the knowledge of it to us.</P>
<P>It is all that Glory, begun in this World and perfected in Heaven, which the Saints &s;hall enjoy to all Eternity. 'Tis the happine&s;s and perfection of the Rea&s;onable Creature in the full enjoy|ment of God for ever. <HI>There is This Life for Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>Man though a Sinner may yet be uni|ted to God. Tis mo&s;t true, that God is a holy God, <HI>and of purer Eyes then to be|hold iniquity.</HI> He cannot approve Sin, yet he can love the Sinner: He hates Sin with a perfect hatred, infinitely; and yet he loves the Sinner with an infinite love. His heart loaths Sin; he is an E|nemy to all Sin, and that irreconcileably; yet he can be reconciled to the Sinner, and become his Friend. They call'd our Saviour Chri&s;t a friend to <HI>Publicans</HI> and <HI>Sinners.</HI> God is a friend of Publicans
<PB N="48" REF="001020_0060_0FAEEC4821645ED0">
and Sinners, and as it were Courts their Friend&s;hip. He is &s;o far from being im|placable to his greate&s;t Enemies, that he is fir&s;t in moving for Peace, and by his Amba&s;&s;adors be&s;eeches them to be re|conciled.</P>
<P>Thus in general, There is Life for the Children of Death. More particularly, There is a removal of Death, and Life that is recovered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a removal of Death here im|plyed</HI>; or Death is taken away. That is, All evil of Sin, and Suffering. As to the evil of Sin.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a freedom from the Guiltine&s;s.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a freedom from the Guiltine&s;s of Sin.</HI> And Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters are di|rected by Chri&s;t, <HI>To give knowledge of Salvation to his People by the Remi&s;&s;ion of their Sins, Luke</HI> 1.77.

<HEAD>THE Declaration &amp; Confe&s;&s;ion OF E&s;ther Rodgers, Of <HI>Kittery</HI> in the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> in <HI>New England,</HI> Single woman.</HEAD>
<P>I was born at <HI>Kittery</HI> &s;ometime in <HI>May,</HI> 1680. At the Age of Thirteen came to live as an Apprentice to Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Woodbridge</HI> of <HI>Newbury.</HI> Had little or no thoughts of God or Re|ligion, though Living in a Religious Fa|mily; was taught to Read, Learned Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> Catechi&s;m, and had frequent op|portunities of going to Publick Meetings; but was a carele&s;s Ob&s;erver of Sabbaths, and Hearer of Sermons; no Word that

ever I heard or read making any Impre&s;|&s;ion upon my Heart, (as I Remember) Neither did I at all give my &s;elf to Secret Prayer, or any other Duty that concern|ed the Salvation of my Soul. And becau&s;e I thus neglected God, refu&s;ed his Coun|&s;il, and would not walk in his Ways, therefore he ju&s;tly gave me up to my own hearts Lu&s;ts, and ways of Wicked|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>About the Age of Seventeen, I was left to fall into that foul Sin of Unclean|ne&s;s, &s;uffering my &s;elf to be defiled by a <HI>Negro</HI> Lad living in the &s;ame Hou&s;e. After I perceived that I was wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Child, I meditated how to prevent coming to Publick Shame; Satan pre&s;ently &s;etting in with his Temptation, I &s;oon comply|ed and re&s;olved to Murder the Child, if ever I &s;hould have one born alive: and continued in my wicked purpo&s;e all a|long, till I had the fatal Opportunity of putting it into Execution. Being deli|vered of a Living Child, I u&s;ed means pre&s;ently to &s;top the breath of it, and kept it hid in an upper Room, till the Darkne&s;s of the Night following, gave advantage for a Private Burial in the Garden.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="001020_0135_0FAEE9A0B4577D88">All this was done in Secret, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er|&s;on living what&s;oever, no not &s;o much as the Father of the Child him&s;elf was privy to my di&s;po&s;al of it, or knew that I ever had &s;uch a Child.</P>
<P>Afterwards reflecting on what I had done, was followed with &s;ome Awak|ening, Frights and Convictions during my abode at Mr. <HI>Woodbridges,</HI> which was about half a year. Yet, never mak|ing any &s;erious Addre&s;s to God for par|don of the&s;e my great and hainous Sins.

<P>About a year after, I returned to <HI>Newbury</HI> to Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Woodbridges</HI> again, where my former Sins came fre&s;h to Re|membrance, and troubled me a while; which together with other rea&s;ons, oc|ca&s;ioned my Removal to another place in the Town. But there al&s;o I took all Opportunities to follow my old Trade of running out a Nights, or entertaining my Sinful Companions in a back part

And being with Child again, I was in as great concern to know how to hide this as the former. Yet did not &s;o &s;oon re&s;olve the Murder|ing of it, but was continually hurried in my thoughts, and undetermined till the la&s;t hour. I went forth to be deli|vered in the Field, and dropping my Child by the &s;ide of a little Pond, (whe|ther alive, or &s;till Born I cannot tell) I covered it over with Dirt and Snow, and &s;peedily returned home again.

<P>THE fir&s;t time Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> came to &s;ee me; after much other Di&s;|cour&s;e, he told me of the odiou&s;ne&s;s of Sin; and that if ever I came to be &s;en|&s;ible of it, I &s;hould loath it, and not be|cau&s;e of my own puni&s;hment procured thereby, but becau&s;e of the Di&s;honour done to God. Then after he was gone, I began to think that I never loathed Sin &s;o as yet, and was in a dreadful Ca&s;e indeed; to think what a wretched Con|dition I had brought my &s;elf into, and had di&s;honoured God: in&s;omuch that I

After a while God made me to think that it was Satans Temptation to keep me from Repen|tance: But if I could Repent and Be|lieve in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I might find mercy, although I was &s;uch a Sin|ner. And although I am &s;uch a vile Sinner, I hope God has made me &s;en&s;i|ble of my &s;ins, he has made me to loath my &s;elf, and truly to Repent for Sin. God has made me to &s;ee that there is nothing that I can do can &s;ave me, but that there is a &s;ufficiency in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And I do throw my &s;elf at his Feet for mercy, and have hope from his promi&s;es. <HI>Let the wicked for|&s;ake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him Return to the Lord, for he will have mercy on him: and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI> And I do &s;o far as I know my &s;elf, Repent of my &s;o great &s;ins again&s;t &s;o good a God; for that which has been the delight of
