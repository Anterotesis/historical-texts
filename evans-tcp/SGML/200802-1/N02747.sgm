<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Letter was wrote and publi&s;h'd more than eight Years agoe, when the Town was in great Di&s;tre&s;s by the &s;preading of the Small Pox, which had not vi&s;ited it for nineteen Years before; and when the new Method of receiving the Di&s;temper by Inoculation fir&s;t began to be put in Practice among us. It &s;oon appear'd that the Hazard of Inoculation was much le&s;s than of common Infection, yet it met with much Oppo&s;ition. Not a few of tho&s;e who expected to undergo the Di&s;temper, had <HI>re|ligious Scruples</HI> in their Minds again&s;t re|ceiving it in this Way; and &s;uch would fre|quently ask my Tho'ts about the Lawfulne&s;s of it, with all the Signs of con&s;cientious Doubters. It was certainly my Duty to an|&s;wer them according to the be&s;t Light I had, leaving them then to judge for them&s;elves. And having often done this in a private Way, to &s;ave Time and Trouble to my &s;elf and others, I publi&s;hed the following Reply to all or mo&s;t of the Objections I then met with. I endea|voured to make the An&s;wers &s;hort and plain, and &s;o to fit them for common U&s;e. The
<PB N="ii" REF="003270_0004_0FF02F9F91C554E8">Reoder will ea&s;ily perceive that &s;ome of the Objections relate to the peculiar Circum&s;tan|ces of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> at that Time; and he may, perhaps, think many of them weak and trifling; yet they were &s;uch as were commonly offer'd, and in &s;uch Ca&s;es the weake&s;t mu&s;t be conde|&s;cended to.</P>
<P>And now that the Di&s;temper has again vi&s;ited the Town, and <HI>Inoculation</HI> is &s;till in &s;ome mea&s;ure the Subject of Di&s;pute, I have been applied to for my Con&s;ent to another Impre&s;&s;ion. I know of no Rea&s;on to be again&s;t it, my Tho'ts continuing &s;till the &s;ame, and my Opinion in favour of the Practice being more confirmed; And I think I have &s;aid nothing that can offend any, but &s;uch as will a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the Government of others Con&s;ciences, or will be di&s;pleas'd with any thing that does not agree with their e&s;pou&s;ed Sentiments.</P>
<P>By the be&s;t Information I can get, the learned and pious, both <HI>Divines</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;i|cians,</HI> do more and more give into the Prac|tice, <HI>here</HI> and in <HI>England.</HI> Soon after the following Letter was printed here in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> it was reprinted in <HI>London,</HI> together with the Reverend Mr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Account of the Method and Succe&s;s of this Practice; to which was prefix'd an hi&s;torical Introduction by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Neal.</HI> I have the Satisfaction
<PB N="iii" REF="003270_0005_0FF02FA241BD7AF8">to &s;ee that <HI>Gentleman</HI> &s;ay of the An&s;wers, that He thinks they are <HI>clear and &s;olid; but whether they are &s;ufficient to encou|rage con&s;cientious and tender Parents, to provide for the &s;afety of their Children in this Way, mu&s;t be left</HI> (He &s;ays) <HI>to the Judgment of every Reader.</HI> This indeed is a Ca&s;e I have not directly an&s;wered; nor did I think there was much Occa&s;ion for it. It has always been allow'd that Parents have a Power to act for their Children, in Things wherein their Lives, as well as other Inte|re&s;ts, are concern'd, till they are capable to judge and act for them&s;elves. And I believe few Parents who are clear in it for them|&s;elves, will neglect it for their Children.</P>
<P>I would take this Opportunity, now that the Practice is le&s;s formidable than it was, and con&s;iderable Numbers are like to go into it, to caution Per&s;ons again&s;t acting ra&s;hly and precipitantly in &s;o tender and important an Affair. I would advi&s;e none to go into it without a due regard to their Con&s;titution, and &s;uch a Preparation of their Bodies as the Phy&s;ician whom they con&s;ult may advi&s;e to. Much le&s;s &s;hould any dare to venture upon it till they have &s;eriou&s;ly endeavour'd by the Help of divine Grace, to get the great Con|cerns of their Souls well &s;ecur'd; and till they have &s;uch a Satisfaction in their own Minds, as that they can in this way as well as the

<HEAD>A REPLY TO THE <HI>Religious Scruples</HI> again&s;t Inocula|ting the SMALL POX.
In a Letter to a Friend.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE new Method of receiving the Small Pox by <HI>Inci&s;ion</HI> (or <HI>In|oculation</HI> as 'tis commonly call'd) has been, you know, the Subject not only of plentiful Di&s;cour&s;e, but of angry Debate, and fierce Contention among us in this Town. And it is a very un|happy Circum&s;tance attending us here, that almo&s;t every thing that is now done or doing among us, if it be at all of a publick Nature, creates Heats and Animo|&s;ities. I am in hopes our good People will by and by be &s;en&s;ible of the Folly and
<PB N="2" REF="003270_0008_0FF02FA6D353C4E8">Mi&s;chief of this, and come to &s;uch a Tem|per as will &s;uffer them to <HI>differ</HI> from one another, without being <HI>angry</HI> with one a|nother. In the mean Time, I hope that the People in other Towns where the Di|&s;temper has made its Entrance, will pre|&s;erve a better Temper, if any among them &s;hould put this Method into Practice.</P>
<P>However &s;ome among us may appear again&s;t it out of Party and Prejudice, yet there are many who are <HI>con&s;ci|entiou&s;ly</HI> aver&s;e to it, I believe; and, if the&s;e pre&s;erve the <HI>Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom,</HI> they are (as a <HI>very Reverend Per&s;on</HI> has lately &s;aid of them) greatly to be commended and honoured, in that they will not act a|gain&s;t a doubting Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>I perceive that the Scruples and Obje|ctions commonly offer'd by People here, have &s;uch a Force upon your Mind, as keeps you from going into this Method, which may, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, be your Safety and Pre&s;ervation. Now <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> (the Offices of which &s;hould be &s;acredly regarded by us) obliges me to attempt to relieve and help you, in a Matter wherein your <HI>Life,</HI> &s;o precious in it &s;elf, and de&s;ervedly dear to me, is &s;o much concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003270_0009_0FF02FAAD309D338">For Satisfaction about the Method and Succe&s;s of this Practice, I refer you to the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> on it made and pub|li&s;h'd by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Colman</HI>; hav|ing been my &s;elf a Witne&s;s to mo&s;t of the In&s;tances he mentions.</P>
<P>But that which you want Satisfaction a|bout is, the <HI>Scruples</HI> and Objections of a <HI>con&s;cientious</HI> or religious Nature, which are commonly offer'd by People again&s;t this Method. The&s;e I &s;hall endeavour to an|&s;wer and re&s;olve, as I am able, in a few Words; and if they afford you any Light or Satisfaction re&s;pecting the &s;ame, you may communicate them to whom you plea&s;e; and if it &s;hould be thought worth while to make them publick, I think none can cen&s;ure me for &s;tarting out of my Line, or medling with what is none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ince the Thing I am now upon relates to <HI>Religion and Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 1. One great Thing urg'd again&s;t this Practice is, <HI>That it is not lawful for me to make my &s;elf &s;ick when I am well. Or vo|luntarily to bring a Di&s;temper upon my &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> To bring Sickne&s;s upon one's &s;elf for its own &s;ake, is what no Man in his right Wits would do. But to make my &s;elf &s;ick in <HI>&s;uch a Way,</HI> as may prabably &s;erve my Health, and &s;ave my Life, and with
<PB N="4" REF="003270_0010_0FF02FAE85505A00">&s;uch a <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> is certainly fitting and rea|&s;onable, and therefore lawful. This is eve|ry Day practis'd among People without any Scruple, in Purges and Vomits, and other Things in medical U&s;e. Now, if I may lawfully make my &s;elf &s;ick by taking &s;omething in at my Mouth, why not by putting &s;omething in at my <HI>Arm</HI>? Or, if I may lawfully make my &s;elf &s;ick for <HI>one Day,</HI> why not for <HI>two Days,</HI> or more, as the Ca&s;e may require? Aye, but this is to bring a <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> upon my &s;elf. I think it can <HI>hardly be call'd</HI> bringing it upon my &s;elf, when the Ca&s;e is &s;o with me, (not having had the Di&s;temper, and living in an infected Air) that I can't but expect to undergo it in a very little time. I know indeed God can pre&s;erve me from the In|fection; but when my Neighbours all round me are vi&s;ited, I know of no <HI>War|rant</HI> that any particular Per&s;on has to ex|pect an <HI>extraordinary Pre&s;ervation.</HI> He that has no Rea&s;on to think, but that he is as liable to the <HI>Small Pox</HI> as other People are, and yet keeps in the Way of it, <HI>ex|pecting that God will pre&s;erve him untouch'd,</HI> however &s;ome may give it the Name of Tru&s;t, and Faith, and the like, I cannot but look upon it and call it <HI>Pre&s;umption.</HI> In &s;hort, I can't but think, when I am in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, that I can neither <HI>ra|tionally</HI> not <HI>warrantably</HI> expect to e&s;cape
<PB N="5" REF="003270_0011_0FF02FB00D5AD6A8">the Di&s;temper, that it is <HI>then</HI> lawful for me to bring upon my &s;elf a <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> Degree of it, to prevent a <HI>greater.</HI> I'll put the Ca&s;e thus, If I have not had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed there is in my Body, what I'll call the <HI>Fuel</HI> of that Di&s;temper, and there only wants the lighting of a <HI>Spark</HI> to &s;et this Fuel on burning. The <HI>Air</HI> I breath in is full of the&s;e Sparks; and I may expect <HI>every Breath I fetch</HI> to draw &s;ome of them in: If now it appears upon daily Experi|ence, that by making an Inci&s;ion in my <HI>Arm,</HI> and letting the Spark in that Way, the Fuel will burn with le&s;s Fiercene&s;s, and con&s;equently Danger, why may'nt I take it in that Way? Why mu&s;t I needs &s;tay till it comes in at my <HI>Mouth</HI> or <HI>No&s;trils,</HI> or thro' &s;ome of the <HI>porous Parts</HI> of my Body? For my Part, I think the Law of <HI>Self-Pre&s;ervation,</HI> which is God's <HI>Law,</HI> re|quires me to take this Method of Safety, whereby (to u&s;e the apt Words of another) the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> is, thro' God's common Ble&s;&s;ing, happily converted into a <HI>Remedy.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. 2. <HI>But ought we not to wait God's Time for it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I think <HI>then is the Time</HI> Providence calls me to this Method of Safety, when I am in imminent and <HI>immediate</HI> Danger of the Di&s;temper the other Way. Should any one go into the Practice of Inoculation,
<PB N="6" REF="003270_0012_0FF02FB2DD518DE0">out of a <HI>Bravado,</HI> without his being in known hazard of the Di&s;temper by the common Way of Infection, I &s;hould not think it warrantable. But <HI>then is God's time</HI> for us to u&s;e Means of Safety, when we are in <HI>apparent Danger</HI> of any deadly or de&s;tructive Evil.</P>
<P><HI>Obj</HI> 3. But 'tis objected again, <HI>Can we not tru&s;t God</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e every Body will allow that the U&s;e of Means is not incon&s;i&s;tent with Tru&s;t in God; and why there can't be Tru&s;t in God in the U&s;e of <HI>this</HI> Means, as well as other, I cannot imagine.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 4. But, <HI>it is a going from God to Man.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> How! Can't we make U&s;e of Men and Means in a Time of Danger without going from God? If any, like <HI>A&s;a,</HI> look to the <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> and <HI>not to the Lord,</HI> they are very irreligious and profane therein. But if any do <HI>principally</HI> and in the fir&s;t Place &s;eek to God, may they not then in|nocently and lawfully make u&s;e of the <HI>be&s;t human Help</HI> the Providence of God affords them? I mu&s;t profe&s;s and declare on the Part of many of the inoculated, that they, and their Friends concern'd for them have gone into the Practice, with <HI>many Prayers</HI> to God, and other &s;uitable Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Tru&s;t and Devotion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003270_0013_0FF02FB4870D4C40"><HI>Obj.</HI> 5. But &s;till &s;ome &s;ay, this Practice looks to them, like <HI>taking God's Work out of his Hand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Indeed this Di&s;temper can arre&s;t none without a Commi&s;&s;ion from God. But yet it is not inflicted by God's <HI>immediate Hand</HI>; we receive it in a <HI>Natural Way,</HI> and by Means of <HI>&s;econd Cau&s;es</HI>; and <HI>this we do in the Way of Inoculation,</HI> as well as of com|mon Infection. If we have the Small Pox in either of the&s;e Ways, it is &s;till the Work of God: For all the &s;econd Cau&s;es de|pend on and act under Him the fir&s;t Cau&s;e. And, <HI>the Application of Means natural for this or that End, is it not an Application to the God of Nature</HI>? If God does not co|operate by his <HI>actual Providence,</HI> can the Effect be produc'd? For, <HI>Who is he that &s;aith, and it cometh to pa&s;s, when the Lord commandeth it not</HI>? What is there of the Hand or <HI>Power of Man</HI> in this Work, after the Inci&s;ion is made, and the Matter ap|ply'd? The <HI>Work is &s;till left with God,</HI> and we mu&s;t wait upon him for his actual Influence and Ble&s;&s;ing, even as the Hu&s;|bandman does for the Rain and Sun-&s;hine of Heaven, after the Seed is thrown into the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 6. <HI>But the Small Pox <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a Judgment of God, &s;ent to puni&s;h and humble us for our
<PB N="8" REF="003270_0014_0FF02FBA53DE5D60">Sins; and what &s;hall we &s;o evade it, and think to turn it away from us?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I fully agree to it, that it is a &s;ore Judgment of God upon us for our Sins, which we have much de&s;erv'd: And it is greatly to be lamented that it has no bet|ter Effect upon the Hearts of Men &mdash; But is it unlawful to u&s;e Means for our Pre&s;ervation from a de&s;olating Judgment? <HI>E&s;pecially,</HI> if at the very Time that God &s;ends the Judgment, he &s;hews us a Way to e&s;cape the <HI>Extremity</HI> and De&s;truction at lea&s;t, if not the Touch of it. If a gracious God &s;hews us &s;o much <HI>Mercy</HI> as this un|der the Judgment, does it become us to <HI>put it away from our &s;elves,</HI> or rather &s;hould we not accept it with <HI>Adoring Thankful|ne&s;s</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 7. But &s;ome have &s;aid to me, <HI>This Method tends to take off the Fears of this Di&s;temper from the Minds of People; and who knows of what &s;piritual Advantage the&s;e Fears might be to them</HI>?</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to this I would ask, whether God cannot make the <HI>Mercy</HI> of their Pre|&s;ervation and Recovery in this Way, of &s;piritual Advantage to them al&s;o, and by that <HI>lead them to Repentance</HI>? And, I truly hope, the Salvation of God be&s;tow'd upon &s;ome in <HI>this Way,</HI> as well as the o|ther, will have a gracious &s;anctifying Effect
<PB N="9" REF="003270_0015_0FF02FBD43EA3E38">upon them, under the powerful working of the Spirit of Grace. I was glad to &s;ee the &s;erious Frames <HI>&s;ome of them</HI> were in at the very Time; how much affected they &s;eem'd to be with the Favour of God to them; what a good Profe&s;&s;ion of holy Re&s;olutions, &s;ome of them made. And I would take this Opportunity to call upon them from God to remember the &s;ame, and to be <HI>daily performing their Vows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 8. Some object again&s;t the <HI>Practice</HI> becau&s;e of the <HI>unhappy Con&s;equents</HI> of it among us; <HI>the Feuds and Contention, Sin and Mi&s;chief that it has occa&s;ioned.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Of this, I hope, I am a mournful Spec|tator; And it has made me &s;undry times rea|dy to take up that Wi&s;h, <HI>Oh that I had Wings like a Dove</HI>! And I mu&s;t freely declare, that I look upon that Spirit of Party and Divi&s;ion that is reigning among us, to be a &s;orer Judgment of God upon us, than the Di&s;temper which has &s;o di&s;tre&s;s'd us. But yet, I am far from thinking that the <HI>Badne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>thing</HI> in its &s;elf is to be ar|gu'd or infer'd from this <HI>Effect</HI> of it. For does not the &s;ame Effect attend many o|ther things unque&s;tionably <HI>good</HI> in them|&s;elves; &s;uch as the building of Hou&s;es for the Wor&s;hip of God, the Choice of Mini|&s;ters, and of Per&s;ons to &s;erve in the State, <HI>&amp;c</HI>? Nay, the very preaching of the Go&s;|pel

For I am come to &s;et a Man at variance again&s;t his Father, and the Daughter again&s;t her Mo|ther, and the Daughter-in-law again&s;t her Mother-in-law.

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> But this <HI>Argument</HI> may as well be urg'd again&s;t the U&s;e of <HI>all Phy&s;ick,</HI> nay, even of <HI>Food,</HI> as again&s;t this Practice. I truly believe, as my Bible teaches me, that God has fix'd the Period of every one's Life; but I al&s;o believe, that he has done it with <HI>a Regard to Second Cau&s;es,</HI> or that Cour&s;e of Nature which he has e&s;tabli&s;h'd; <HI>the End and Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s are deter|min'd together.</HI> He that has find in his

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It is &s;trange that any &s;hould put the Que&s;tion! when there is none can give the A&s;&s;urance of this, <HI>not in the mo&s;t inno|cent and common Means,</HI> that are every Day made u&s;e of: Why then &s;hould they de|mand it in <HI>this</HI>? I know of one who died under a Vomit. Another, whom I al&s;o knew, died by pulling out a Tooth; the bleeding at the Gums, after the Extraction of the Tooth could not be &s;topt, and in a little Time he died. And for my own part, as much as I am now for Inoculation, I am not at all &s;hy to &s;ay, that a Per&s;on may mi&s;carry under it: For <HI>God is Sovereign,</HI> and will keep us in a Dependence upon him, in the U&s;e of all Means. But if it appear from Matter of Fact, and Experi|ence truly repre&s;ented, that the Hazard in this Way is far le&s;s than that of accidental Contagion, this I conceive is &s;ufficient to legitimate the Practice, and ju&s;tify any one's going into it, when there is Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003270_0018_0FF02FC4D6414018">Obj. 11. <HI>But &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould die in the Way of Inoculation, would it not make a dying Hour very dark to me, to think that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Means to bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon my &s;elf?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This is a Que&s;tion, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, has been the mo&s;t <HI>affecting</HI> to me, of any that have related to this Matter. But af|ter the mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration I have be&s;tow'd upon it, I thus think; If a Per|&s;on &s;hould die under Inoculation, he dies in the U&s;e of the mo&s;t <HI>likely</HI> Means he knew of, to &s;ave his Life in a Time of common Peril; he dies <HI>then</HI> in the <HI>Way of Duty,</HI> and <HI>&s;o</HI> in <HI>God's Way</HI>: If the Ble&s;&s;ing is denied, he mu&s;t humbly re&s;ign this his frail <HI>Life,</HI> unto the <HI>God of it, Looking for the Mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto Eter|nal Life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 12. There is one thing more &s;aid again&s;t this Practice, which I am loth to take any Notice of, becau&s;e of the <HI>Propha|ne&s;s</HI> of it; but it being &s;o frequently in the Mouths of People, I cannot but name it. 'Tis this, <HI>That it is originally from the De|vil.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Sure this is the Effect of <HI>Tran&s;|port</HI>! I will return a better An&s;wer to it than it de&s;erves: If it be a <HI>Method of Safety,</HI> and a <HI>Benefit to Mankind,</HI> as hitherto it ap|pears to be, how came the Devil to be the Author of it? Was he ever a <HI>Benefactor</HI> to
<PB N="13" REF="003270_0019_0FF02FC92891BA18">Mankind? No: But he is <HI>a Murderer from the Beginning.</HI> Every Age of the World produces &s;ome <HI>new</HI> and u&s;eful Di&s;|coveries, in one Profe&s;&s;ion, Art and Science or another: And if this Di&s;covery be re|&s;erv'd for our Day, why &s;hould it not be accepted <HI>in all Places with all Thankfulne&s;s</HI>? In a Word, I cannot but think its Origi|nal derived el&s;ewhere, becau&s;e my <HI>Bible</HI> teaches me, that <HI>every good and perfect Gift comes down from the Father of Lights.</HI></P>
<P>As to that Objection, of <HI>the Danger of others catching the Di&s;temper from the Ino|culated,</HI> there needs only this to be &s;aid; That as tis to be &s;uppo&s;'d, the Practice will not be gone into till the Danger of Infection becomes common in a Place, &s;o there may be Methods ea&s;ily taken, to prevent its hazarding of others that can't yet come into it. And I think there ought to be a prudent Care in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have freely given you my Thoughts about this Practice, &s;o <HI>much &s;po|ken again&s;t.</HI> I mu&s;t now leave you to judge for your &s;elf, praying God to <HI>&s;hew</HI> you <HI>his Way.</HI> If you come into the Prac|tice, I know you will not do it in <HI>carnal Security</HI>; for that may provoke God to deny the Ble&s;&s;ing. And, if God plea&s;e to give it the de&s;ir'd Succe&s;s, you'll religiou&s;|ly
<PB N="14" REF="003270_0020_0FF02FCAB0612D78">give Glory to him, not only for deli|vering you from <HI>Death,</HI> but for &s;aving you from &s;uch a <HI>Bed of Corruption,</HI> as others have many <HI>weari&s;ome Days and Nights ap|pointed</HI> them in; you'll think your &s;elf the <HI>more oblig'd</HI> to thank and prai&s;e your <HI>kind Phy&s;ician,</HI> (I mean the <HI>Great One</HI>) who has wrought your Cure by &s;o <HI>gentle</HI> a Method.</P>
<P>I have no more to add, but my Prayers, that you and I may be made meet for, and, in God's Time, brought &s;afe to, that World, where there &s;hall be <HI>no more Sick|ne&s;s, nor any more Death,</HI>; where Sin, and all the penal Con&s;equences of it, &s;hall be done away for ever. I am,</P>

<P>HAving Room left for it, I would take the Liberty to offer to your View, <HI>a Scheme of Principles,</HI> (which I take from that truly great Man, and bright Orna|ment of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, <HI>Bi&s;hop Wil|kins</HI>) in the &s;ame Way and Method as is us'd in the Mathematicks, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Po&s;tulata, Definitions</HI> and <HI>Axioms</HI>; which
<PB REF="003270_0021_0FF02FCC38B7D620">are indeed no other than the common Dic|tates of Nature, and agreable to the Rea|&s;on of all Mankind; and which being ap|plied to <HI>Inoculation,</HI> &s;eem unan&s;werably to ju&s;tify the Practice, &s;uppo&s;ing the Proba|bility of Succe&s;s to be much greater on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>A <HI>Scheme</HI> of Natural Principles.</P>
<P>Po&s;tulatum. <HI>Every Thing is endow'd with &s;uch a natural Principle, whereby it is nece&s;|&s;arily inclin'd to promote its own Pre&s;erva|tion and Well-being.</HI></P>
<P>Defin. 1. <HI>That which hath in it a Fitne&s;s to promote this End, is called</HI> Good. <HI>And on the contrary, that which is apt to hinder it, is called</HI> Evil. <HI>Among&s;t which there are &s;e|veral</HI> Degrees, <HI>according as Things have more or le&s;s Fitne&s;s, to promote or hinder this End.</HI></P>
<P>Defin. 2. <HI>The le&s;&s;ening or e&s;caping of</HI> Evil <HI>is to be reckoned under the Notion of Good. The le&s;&s;ening or lo&s;s of</HI> Good <HI>is to be reckoned under the Notion of</HI> Evil.</P>
<P>Axiom 1. <HI>That which is</HI> Good <HI>is to be cho&s;en and pro&s;ecuted, that which is</HI> Evil <HI>is to be avoided.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The greater</HI> Good <HI>is to be preferred
<PB REF="003270_0022_0FF02FCF698B44E8">before the le&s;s, and the le&s;&s;er</HI> Evil <HI>to be en|dured rather than the greater.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Such kinds of Things or Events, as will certainly come to pa&s;s, may fall under Compu|tation, and be e&s;timated as to their &s;everal Degrees, as well as Things pre&s;ent.</HI> Becau&s;e when &s;uch a Space of Time is elaps'd; that which is now <HI>future,</HI> will become <HI>pre&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>And thus likewi&s;e is it for &s;uch Things as may</HI> probably <HI>come to pa&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>A pre&s;ent Good may rea&s;onable be par|ted with, upon a probable Expectation of a future Good which is more excellent.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>A pre&s;ent Evil is to be endur'd, for the avoiding a probable future Evil, which is far greater.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The greater the Evil is, the more Rea|&s;on is there to venture the lo&s;s of a le&s;s Good, or the &s;uffering of a le&s;s Evil, for the e&s;ca|ping of it.</HI></P>
