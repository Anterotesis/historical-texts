<P>AN anxious wi&s;h to &s;ee the &s;ubject of the following &s;heets treated by an abler pen, has hitherto pre|vented the Author from offering the Public this feeble effort to promote their welfare. Finding, however, that nothing adequate to its impor|tance has appeared; and being con|&s;cious of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of perhaps more exten&s;ive experience in the

Malignant Pe&s;tilential Fever, than has fallen to the lot of almo&s;t any practitioner in this country, he thinks it would be acting contrary, to the principles of humanity, as well as the intere&s;t of the medical profe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould he delay any longer a publi|cation, which indeed claims no other merit than truth with re&s;pect to the &s;tatement of facts, and novelty with re&s;pect to the mode of treatment found &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>That the Malignant Pe&s;tilential Fever is no rare occurrence in cold climates, has been too fatally expe|rienced.
<PB N="ix" REF="035302_0008_100217C80BCC2440">
It is not &s;o, however, in hot climates, if we may judge from the writings of medical practitioners; for although &s;ymptoms of malignan|cy have appeared in the Yellow Fe|ver of the country, in its advanced &s;tage, &s;eldom have tho&s;e of pe&s;tilence &s;hewn them&s;elves; and never has contagion till now, rendered the u&s;ual precautions ob&s;erved in Eu|rope again&s;t the introduction of the Plague, nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Perhaps the following con&s;idera|tion may con&s;titute a further apo|logy for the Author's intruding him|&s;elf on the Public: It is evident that
<PB N="x" REF="035302_0009_1002179E0F1E6838">
the mo&s;t re&s;pectable writers on the Malignant Fever have found infinite difficulty in a&s;certaining an appro|priate mode of cure: what but this are we to infer from the following pa&s;&s;ages: "I have ob&s;erved before, that a delirium would ari&s;e from two oppo&s;ite errors; one from large and repeated bleedings; and the other from wine and the cordial me|dicines being taken too early. It ap|pears therefore how nice the princi|ples are that regard the cure: thus, neither a hot nor a cool regimen will an&s;wer with every patient, nor in every &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e."&mdash;"Yet
<PB N="xi" REF="035302_0010_100217CBF25CD668">
were putrefaction the only change made in the body by contagion, it might be ea&s;y to cure &s;uch fevers by the u&s;e of acids only, or other anti&s;eptics. But as the di&s;ea&s;e, when once formed, is not to be removed by &s;uch means alone, it would there|fore &s;eem as if &s;ome parts of the brain, or nervous &s;y&s;tem, were early inflamed, and the fever kept up by that inflammation; as if to this circum&s;tance mo&s;t of the &s;ymptoms were owing; and, as if in the ad|vanced &s;tate, a cure could not be obtained until the ob&s;tructing matter was re&s;olved by &s;uppuration or putre|faction."

which may throw light on this very ob&s;cure &s;ubject.

let prejudice be &s;et a&s;ide, and let facts only be attended to, and &s;ure he is, a candid practitioner will find &s;ufficient encouragement to adopt them.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter on the Hi&s;tory of the Malignant Pe&s;tilential Fever, which &s;o generally prevailed in this and the neigh|bouring i&s;lands, I think it may not be im|proper to give &s;ome account of Grenada, as far as relates to the face of the country, its productions, its di&s;ea&s;es, and the &s;tate of the weather. On &s;ettling in this i&s;land, I was convinced that a knowledge of the climate, and of the various changes which take place in the weather throughout the year, would be highly conducive to &s;ucce&s;s in the practice of Medicine; and I was the more &s;trongly inclined to ob&s;erve and record the&s;e, by finding that nothing of the kind had been hitherto done. For this purpo&s;e I immediately began a diary or journal of the weather; and have ever &s;ince continu|ed it, with few interruptions; but, as a journal of the whole period would be tedi|ous
<PB N="2" REF="035302_0017_100217D9737AD158">
and unnece&s;&s;ary, I have given only that of the three fir&s;t years; and to illu&s;trate my Ob&s;ervations on the Malignant Pe&s;tilential Fever, I have added the journal of the wea|ther for the year 1793. Dr. Hillary is the only medical writer I am acquainted with, who has given the public any account of the weather of the&s;e i&s;lands; but, although his very able account may be very u&s;eful to practitioners in Barbadoes, and other i&s;lands who&s;e &s;urface is comparatively level, and who&s;e hills ri&s;e only to a trifling height, and in no in&s;tance exhibit the wild and pic|ture&s;que &s;cenes of Grenada, St. Vincent, Do|minica, and a few others, it is not &s;o here: and the rea&s;on is evident. The windings of the innumerable hills in Grenada pro|duce a change of temperature at the end of every hundred yards; under their &s;helter the heat is often almo&s;t un&s;upportable, and the body is bathed in the mo&s;t profu&s;e &s;weat: beyond this, turning an angle, and being &s;uddenly expo&s;ed to the prevailing winds, which there blow with violence, propor|tioned to the narrow vallies which confine them, the body is in an in&s;tant dried up: an agui&s;h &s;en&s;ation takes place, and not un|frequently
<PB N="3" REF="035302_0018_100217DB32441E48">
topical pains and inflammations of a mo&s;t dangerous nature, are in&s;tantaneou&s;ly produced. It is from this cau&s;e, as much as from any other that hepatic and pulmonary inflammations are more frequent, and more violent in the&s;e rugged mountainous i&s;lands than in Barbadoes, Antigua, and others of a &s;moother and le&s;s divided &s;urface: and this is the principal cau&s;e al&s;o that topical in|flammations, particularly tho&s;e of the liver, are met with at all &s;ea&s;ons, during the hot and rainy as well as the cool and dry: a cir|cum&s;tance otherwi&s;e inexplicable. It al&s;o accounts for the efficacy, as a preventative of any medium between the &s;hirt and &s;kin, which may ab&s;orb the per&s;pired fluid, whil&s;t it keeps up an equal temperature on the &s;urface, whatever changes take place in the &s;urrounding atmo&s;phere. Thus, a flannel-&s;hirt, however &s;trange it may &s;eem to an European not acquainted with the circum|&s;tance above mentioned, is the be&s;t pre&s;er|vative of health in this i&s;land, and perhaps throughout the torrid zone.</P>
<P>The atmo&s;phere of Grenada differs widely from that of the low i&s;lands, Barbadoes, An|tigua,
<PB N="4" REF="035302_0019_100217DD900C71B8">
&amp;c. The innumerable points and ridges of the two mountains, which run nearly north and &s;outh, and &s;eparate the windward from the leeward di&s;tricts, arre&s;t or attract the pa&s;&s;ing clouds. The&s;e, either falling in rain, or giving ri&s;e to &s;prings, whil&s;t they fertilize the &s;oil, fill the atmo|&s;phere with watery particles. This moi&s;t &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere exi&s;ts throughout the whole year; but is greater in proportion to the quantity and den&s;ity of the clouds. In the rainy &s;ea&s;on torrents of water ru&s;h down the craggy &s;ides of the higher regions of the&s;e mountains; and the rivulets, often overflow|ing their banks by this addition, inundate the country below. In the dry &s;ea&s;on, a con&s;i|derable degree of moi&s;ture is always percep|tible; but then it falls during the night in the form of dew; and the &s;treams and rivu|lets, though plentifully &s;upplied, run in their natural channels with a placid current, ex|cept where their cour&s;e is interrupted by precipitous rocks or large &s;tones. The at|mo&s;phere of the low i&s;lands, on the con|trary, is generally remarkably dry; nor are they ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;treams and rivers which beautify and benefit Grenada. Hence the temperature in &s;ituations even not &s;ub|ject
<PB N="5" REF="035302_0020_100217E0BB917748">
to alternate cold and heat, is very irre|gular; and from this al&s;o it is &s;eldom po&s;|&s;ible to work an electrical machine with advantage, the fluid collected continually flying off, attracted by the &s;urrounding moi&s;ture. From this cau&s;e too the i&s;land, &s;een from &s;ea, is for ever ob&s;cured with clouds; the &s;ummits of the mountains are almo&s;t never di&s;tingui&s;hable; and even hills nearer the coa&s;t, on account of the den&s;ity of the medium through which they are viewed, &s;eldom exhibit their true &s;hape, height, and colours. The low i&s;lands are never thus enveloped in mi&s;t, never thus &s;eem "ever-threat'ning &s;torms;" their atmo&s;phere being le&s;s loaded, becomes a purer medium, and &s;eldom lets fall the deluges experienced here. From the&s;e con&s;iderations, the following Journal may have its u&s;e.</P>
<P>Grenada is one of the mo&s;t &s;outhern of the Caribbean i&s;lands: a &s;ituation which exempts it from the dreadful hurricanes which frequently lay wa&s;te tho&s;e farther northward. It is compo&s;ed of two immen&s;e mountains, which terminate in peaks; but, being united a little below their &s;ummits
<PB N="6" REF="035302_0021_100217E2548FAC00">
by a gradual &s;lope, the divi&s;ion is not at fir&s;t very perceptible. On the windward, or north-ea&s;t &s;ide, the de&s;cent is infinitely more gradual than on the leeward or &s;outh|we&s;t &s;ide; nor is it there encumbered with the multitude of conical hills, and rocks of various form and magnitude, which charac|teri&s;e the latter. So gradual is the ri&s;e of the country in the di&s;trict of Marquis and part of Seauteur, as to give the idea of an ex|ten&s;ive plain, mo&s;t beautifully diver&s;ified by gentle &s;lopes, rivers, delightful vales, thick|ets and exten&s;ive cane-fields, and termin|ated by wooded mountains, who&s;e pointed tops are often hid in clouds. The leeward &s;ide, on the contrary, is mountainous to the very &s;ea; and the whole is thrown together in the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t picture&s;que manner. Magnitude and boldne&s;s of de&s;ign are the prevailing features. In general, excepting a part of the windward &s;ide of the i&s;land, by &s;uppo&s;ing innumerable and di&s;tinct ac|clivities of conical or angular figures, in|crea&s;ing in bulk as they are removed from the &s;ea, crowding on each other, and at length terminating in two enormous piles, who&s;e crags and ridges &s;hagged with wood,
<PB N="7" REF="035302_0022_100217E3E84D94C8">
and who&s;e cliffs, often &s;een towering above the floating clouds in augu&s;t and gigantic forms, exhibit a mo&s;t &s;tupendous back|ground,&mdash;we &s;hall be able to conceive a to|lerably ju&s;t idea of the grand outlines of the very &s;ingular &s;cenery of this romantic coun|try. On more attentively viewing the picture, we find hills precipitous, acclivous, or winding circularly in &s;harp inacce&s;&s;ible ridges, &s;o as to form frightful gullies, torn by torrents in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, or deep, dark glens and bounded hollows, &s;eldom trod by human foot; where &s;treams, brawling over pebbly beds, or often interrupted in their cour&s;e, and falling over the &s;urface of a rocky &s;carp, and collected in &s;tony ba&s;ons underneath, form &s;hady cool retreats; in which alone

ca&s;cades, &s;ometimes fifty feet in height; but no living creature, except the wood-pigeon; a few &s;mall birds, the dappled agootee, and the armadilloe, inhabit the&s;e wilds. Where cultivation ends, little &s;cattered &s;pots are &s;een diver&s;ifying this wilderne&s;s of wood, on which the indu&s;trious hands of poor &s;ettlers, chiefly French, have formed &s;mall plantations of coffee, intermixed with plan|tains, and &s;heltered from the rude &s;hock of the prevailing north-ea&s;t wind, by hedges of the ever green calaba<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Calophyllum Calaba, Linnaei.</NOTE>, who&s;e deep &s;hade affords an intere&s;ting variegation from the &s;urrounding paler green. Alternating with the&s;e are &s;een neat but &s;mall patches, pro|ducing all the kitchen can require in the vegetable kingdom; which, continual moi&s;|ture and coolne&s;s contributing to their pro|duction, are ever plentifully rai&s;ed. Beyond this, cultivation takes a larger &s;weep, and often with coffee, cacao, cotton, are &s;een fields of &s;ugar-cane, planted and flouri&s;hing on the &s;teep &s;ides of hills, or in narrow winding vallies, frequently chequered by in|&s;ulated cones, or tu&s;ted craggs of grote&s;que

Here too are &s;een the &s;tately mountain-cabbage, and the wide-&s;preading &s;ilk cotton-trees, towering above all others, in maje&s;tic pre|eminence: rivers are &s;een winding through every valley, and here and there natural pa&s;|tures are left, on which the cattle and &s;tock of neighbouring plantations are &s;een feeding. Farther on, and even to the &s;ea, where the &s;urface admits of cultivation, the whole is covered with the &s;ugar-cane, regularly plant|ed in oblong fields, &s;eparated by hedges of

the lime, the logwood, the Angola-pea, the fal&s;e acacia, the prickly pear, phy&s;ic-nut, &amp;c. The&s;e are frequently diver&s;ified by irregular groupes of negroe-huts, &s;urrounded by and intermixed with groves of the banana, and arbours of the grenadilla, water-lemon, and various viminious plants of the pea kind. Ad|joining the&s;e romantic groupes, are &s;een the dwelling-hou&s;es, and the works, as they are called, or the buildings erected for the manu|facture of the cane-juice into &s;ugar; to which not unfrequently are attached orchards con|taining a great variety of indigenous and exotic fruit-trees. In detached corners al&s;o are &s;een the gardens or provi&s;ion-grounds of the negroes, planted according to the whim or ta&s;te of the temporary owner; and here and there the tops of conical hills, too &s;teep or too barren for culture, crowned with tufts of natural wood, become intere&s;ting objects, from the variety of tints they in|troduce.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t in many places terminates ab|ruptly in rocky precipices, the face of which is often curiou&s;ly perforated into caverns, arches, &amp;c. by the continual da&s;hing of

The tops of the&s;e pre|cipices are &s;ometimes fertile, but more ge|nerally either a bare &s;oft rock, probably a volcanic production, called by the inhabit|ants, Tuf, or producing a curious &s;pecies of cyperus, intermixed with trees of the erect prickly pear, or the Aby&s;&s;inian koll-quall of Mr. Bruce. In other places, it runs out into long narrow points, frequently end|ing in high cliffs of tuf, but more fre|quently in curious rocks or congeries of the Madripore coralline, the cells of which neare&s;t the &s;ea, and occa&s;ionally overflowed by it, are inhabited by zoophytes, litho|phytes, and animals of the Mollu&s;ca-tribe.

The&s;e coralline-beds and groves are frequently extremely dangerous to &s;hipping.

The tran&s;parency of the water over the&s;e coral|lines is &s;o remarkably great, that the bottom can be di&s;tinctly &s;een at the depth of ten and fifteen fathoms; and on taking a view of the coa&s;t from any con&s;iderable adjoining height, the whiti&s;h or light green colour of the &s;ea, clearly points out the limits of the&s;e curious productions. Every where on their &s;urface va&s;t quantities of echini and a&s;terias are found; the former trouble&s;ome and even dangerous, by their long and &s;trong prickles, or &s;pines. They con&s;titute al&s;o the &s;ecure abode, except in &s;tormy weather, of innu|merable crabs, &s;ea cray-fi&s;h and univalve &s;hell-fi&s;h: of the la&s;t of which there is a great and beautiful variety.

The gentleman who re|lated the anecdote to me, with another, vi|&s;ited this old gentleman two or three years before his death. They found him employed in having a negro-wench flogged: and as he was blind, he was led to the place where the culprit lay, in order, by feeling, to know whether the puni&s;hment had been properly inflicted or not. Being &s;atisfied in this point, he returned with a firm &s;teady &s;tep to his &s;eat. The cau&s;e of this puni&s;hment was &s;till more extraordinary. A Mr. Maly, Mr. Forthon's grand&s;on-in-law, a&s;&s;ured my in|formant, that Forthon puni&s;hed the wench, who acted as a kind of hou&s;ekeeper to him, for refu&s;ing to admit of his embraces.&mdash;The French and Creole inhabitants are never afflicted with the fatal topical inflam|mations, often epidemic among the Engli&s;h and negroes; nor do fevers of a bad kind ever appear among them.

One very extraordinary in&s;tance will &s;uffice to &s;how the propriety of con&s;idering this di&s;ea&s;e as one of the epidemics of the dry &s;ea&s;on. On the e&s;tates of Edmund Thornton, E&s;q. &s;ituated in the di&s;|trict of St. George's pari&s;h, called Point Saline, already de&s;cribed, and at the farthe&s;t extremity of it, the ne|groes are attacked regularly every year, about the begin|ning of November, with &s;ymptoms of the Guinea-worm. In the month of January the di&s;ea&s;e &s;preads throughout the greate&s;t part of the gang; and in the month of March it entirely di&s;appears; and they continue ex|empted from it till the following November. The cau&s;e of this &s;ingular di&s;ea&s;e on the e&s;tates I have men|tioned, &s;eems to be confined to the water of &s;ome wells, which have been dug in the &s;ub&s;tance, called Tuf, of which the whole gang drink; there being no &s;prings or rivulets in the di&s;trict, and unfortunately no ci&s;terns to collect and pre&s;erve the rain water. This has been ren|dered evident by what has happened on &s;ome neigh|bouring e&s;tates; the negroes of which, till of late, were as &s;ubject to this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing complaint as tho&s;e belong|ing to Mr. Thornton. The wells were filled up, ci&s;|terns built, or wells dug in places not &s;ubject to the in|fluence of the flow and ebb of the tide; and at the re|turn of the u&s;ual period of the appearance of the Guinea-worm, nothing of the kind happened. They have ever &s;ince (three years now) continued exempted from the di&s;ea&s;e. In the water which contains the embryos of the dracunculi, the naked eye di&s;tingui&s;hes innumerable animalcules, darting in every direction with a&s;toni&s;hing force and rapidity: the&s;e, on being &s;ub|jected to examination in a &s;mall micro&s;cope, exhibit a very extraordinary figure, differing from any animal|cules hitherto de&s;cribed. Till within the&s;e few years, this di&s;ea&s;e was con&s;idered as peculiar to that part of the coa&s;t of Guinea contained between Cape Coa&s;t Ca&s;tle and Acras, about ninety miles in extent: and it was believed that the &s;laves from the Gold Coa&s;t were alone &s;ubject to it, and always brought it with them to the We&s;t Indies, but never contracted it there. This how|ever has been proved to be without foundation; for the Creole-negroes are as &s;ubject to it as the Africans. In|fants have it as well as the mo&s;t aged; and no part of the body or extremities is exempted from it: the arms, legs, every part of the trunk, the &s;crotum, penis, and even the pudenda muliebria, within the labia.</NOTE>

lepro&s;y, and tetanus, may be ranked among the &s;poradic endemics of this country, and are certainly not the lea&s;t tremendous of them; but fortunately they are either confined to the negro race, or rarely occur. The &s;pecies of tetanus peculiar to infants, and hence called Tri&s;mus Na&s;centium, is an endemic of this i&s;land, and always a fatal one: it prevails only in the mar&s;hy and moi&s;t parts of the i&s;land, and takes place any time before the ninth day after birth; after which period it has never been known to happen. It does not appear to ari&s;e from a retention of the meconium; for however carefully infants have been evacuated, the di&s;ea&s;e has in no in&s;tance been thereby prevented. From its preva|lence in moi&s;t, cold, or mar&s;hy &s;ituations, we may with more propriety attribute it to cold and impure air. This dreadful malady admits of no cure; but we fortunately po&s;&s;e&s;s a mo&s;t certain preventive. It is with &s;ingular plea&s;ure I a&s;&s;ign the di&s;covery of this beneficial application to my worthy and experienced friend Dr. John Stewart, of this i&s;land. About five or &s;ix years ago, on an e&s;tate which this gentleman had the
<PB N="37" REF="035302_0052_100218266F5FEA18">
charge of, the manager frequently men|tioned to him the unfavourable circum&s;tance of all the infants born on it dying of the locked jaw before the ninth day, and that this had uniformly been the event in every in&s;tance for many years, although every po&s;&s;ible caution had been taken to prevent it. The plantation was &s;ituated in a valley, and con&s;equently damp; but in all other re&s;pects healthy. Ob&s;erving that the negro midwives were not very nice in their choice of the in&s;trument with which they cut the umbilical cord, he &s;u&s;pected that the rubiginous particles might produce &s;uch irritation as to cau&s;e the fatal di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion. Having this in view, he directed the midwives to dre&s;s the part with a folded piece of &s;oft linen, well &s;moaked in &s;pirit of turpentine, in&s;tead of the common way. They attended to his directions; and not a &s;ingle infant has died on the e&s;tate &s;ince. The practice, in &s;ituations wherein this di&s;ea&s;e has occurred, has become general, and has been attended with &s;ucce&s;s in every in&s;tance. It may not be u&s;ele&s;s to add, that &s;everal planters, both here and in Tobago, make u&s;e of this application to lambs, calves,
<PB N="38" REF="035302_0053_1002182809893D08">
and colts, with equal &s;ucce&s;s. As many of the&s;e animals die &s;oon after they are dropped in moi&s;t and mar&s;hy &s;ituations of this coun|try, the adoption of this &s;imple preventive may be a general benefit to the inhabit|ants.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is frequently vi&s;ited by the &s;mall pox, &s;ometimes of the confluent or malignant kind. It has in almo&s;t every in&s;tance been introduced from the coa&s;t of Africa, in the &s;lave-&s;hips; on board of which it frequently breaks out, and commits dread|ful ravages on the pa&s;&s;age to the We&s;t Indies; but as inoculation is always had recour&s;e to at the time, or &s;oon after this di&s;ea&s;e ap|pears, the mortality occa&s;ioned by it is &s;el|dom con&s;iderable. The chicken-pox is com|mon almo&s;t every year; and as it appears without any evident introduction, it may be con&s;idered as more an endemic than a foreign di&s;ea&s;e. It is always mild, and re|quires no other treatment than a laxative at the turn, or when the pu&s;tules dry.</P>
<P>The mea&s;les and hooping cough &s;eldom appear here; for in the cour&s;e of ten years

I recollect only two in&s;tances of the former, and one of the latter: they were of a very bad kind, and proved fatal to many children.</P>
<P>No in&s;tance, as far as I have been able to learn, has occurred of a bite or &s;ting of any poi&s;onous reptile, &s;nake, or &s;erpent; and indeed of the latter there are only two kinds found, both of which are &s;aid to be harmle&s;s. Scorpions, &s;colopendras, a large &s;pecies of &s;pider called Tarantula, and two or three &s;pecies of wa&s;ps, are &s;ometimes trouble&s;ome, and by their &s;tings occa&s;ion painful inflammations; but are never poi|&s;onous. The &s;ting-rays very frequently in|flict very dangerous wounds; and the pric|kles of the &s;ea-eggs, often unperceived, give the unwary a &s;hock as violent and unex|pected as that of electricity. The little wounds they inflict, though not dangerous, are exceedingly trouble&s;ome and painful. The negroes make u&s;e of a very &s;imple me|thod of extracting the&s;e prickles; they place the patient's foot over a fire as clo&s;e as po&s;|&s;ible, without burning, and when it is &s;uf|ficiently heated, they rub it well with can|dle-grea&s;e,
<PB N="40" REF="035302_0055_1002182C022024C8">
and repeat the operation three or four times; they then wrap it up, and a few hours after, the prickles fall out. The pain cea&s;es after the fir&s;t application of the heat and grea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that Grenada &s;urpa&s;&s;es almo&s;t all the Windward and Lee|ward i&s;lands in the abundance and good|ne&s;s of its water. I may add, that it al&s;o excels in its medicinal &s;prings: &s;ome of the&s;e are hot, but the greate&s;t number are cold. Of the former the mo&s;t noted are tho&s;e of Duque&s;ne Valley, &s;ituated in the pari&s;h of St. Patrick. The temperature of the hotte&s;t of the&s;e &s;prings is 116 degrees; and from their habitudes with precipitants, compared with Bergman's Analy&s;is,<NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Bergman's Chemical E&s;&s;ays, Vol. 1.</NOTE> they appear to contain a con&s;iderable portion of iron, magne&s;ia, a mineral alkali, and common &s;alt. Aerated acid is not indi|cated by lime-water, or the blue flowers of the vervein. Their &s;mell is pretty much hepati&s;ed; from which, and their heat, it is probable they contain a &s;mall portion of &s;ulphur in a very volatile &s;tate. They
<PB N="41" REF="035302_0056_1002182ECD2036D8">
have been u&s;ed frequently internally and ex|ternally, with con&s;iderable advantage in chro|nic rheumati&s;ms, herpetic complaints, old ulcers, &s;crophula, and lepro&s;y; but they ri&s;e in a country &s;o extremely rugged, and unfortu|nately &s;o little attention has been paid to the road or path which leads to them, that much general benefit cannot be expected from them. Of the cold medicinal &s;prings, the mo&s;t remarkable are tho&s;e of Montro&s;e and the Hermitage, in the pari&s;h of St. Patrick; and tho&s;e of Beaugency, in St. George's pari&s;h. The temperature of all the&s;e is 78 degrees; and from their habitudes with precipitants, they appear (particularly the two former) to contain a large portion of vitriolated magne&s;ia and a mineral alkali. The Beaugency water appears to be true Selt|zer, containing a much larger proportion of aerated acid than the former. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;prings, there are found in a few places, particularly on the Hermitage, mephitic exhalations, of a mo&s;t pernicious nature. The Hermitage vapour i&s;&s;ues from a &s;mall hole in the &s;ide of a ri&s;ing ground, within a few yards of the river Antoine; no water ri&s;es with it, but in i&s;&s;uing it makes a &s;in|gular

hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e. Around the opening from whence this &s;tream of mephitic air comes, a number of birds, lizards, and other &s;mall animals are found dead; and experiments have been made which prove its deadly influence on dogs and fowls.</P>
<P>The year in the We&s;t Indies is divided into two portions; the one called the Dry, the other the Wet &s;ea&s;on. Some divide each of the&s;e al&s;o into two; which they call the Long and Short winter, and the Short and Long &s;ummer. The latter divi&s;ion has been made by the French; but as it is not always ob&s;ervable, it will be &s;ufficient barely to have mentioned it. What is generally under&s;tood by the expre&s;&s;ion Dry Sea&s;on, is the portion of the year contained between the beginning of December and the end of April. The commencement and termina|tion however of this &s;ea&s;on are not always ob&s;erved to happen at tho&s;e periods; for the rains may continue till the beginning of January, recur frequently during the vernal months, and &s;et in again at the be|ginning of April; or not appear till June or July. It is fortunate however for the
<PB N="43" REF="035302_0058_10021831F568ED88">
planter, that the&s;e deviations from the u&s;ual cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on &s;eldom occur; for, when they do, their effects are often fatally experi|enced on the extent of the crops. The dry &s;ea&s;on, in its ordinary cour&s;e, is plea&s;ant and healthy, the &s;ky exhibiting a va&s;t expan&s;e of azure, uninterrupted by clouds or any den&s;e medium; and the atmo&s;phere being pure, dry, and-temperate. It is almo&s;t con&s;tantly u&s;hered in by northerly, or north|we&s;terly winds, and the&s;e and north-ea&s;t|erly winds prevail with little variation the whole of its continuance; but are mo&s;t chilly, dry, and boi&s;terous in the months of December, January, and Fe|bruary. If however the wind, during this &s;ea&s;on, &s;hould in the day-time blow from any other point but tho&s;e I have mentioned, it always towards the clo&s;e of evening re|turns to a northerly point. Thus it &s;ome|times happens in extraordinary years, that from 6 A. M. to 7 or 8 P. M. the wind is from a point between S. and E. or S. and W. but, at the latter hour, it &s;uddenly veers round to the northward, and con|tinues &s;o till the following morning, when it again changes to the &s;outhward. The
<PB N="44" REF="035302_0059_10021833960C9F70">
total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of vegetation during this &s;ea&s;on is &s;urpri&s;ing, and &s;eems to be oc|ca&s;ioned by the want of moi&s;ture, and the ex&s;iccative &s;hrivelling quality of the north|erly winds. That it is to be attributed chiefly to the latter is evident, from the in|efficacy of the rain which &s;ometimes falls very plentifully in the dry months, in ex|citing a &s;pring in vegetables: when how|ever they are longer continued than u&s;ual, their vegetative power faintly di&s;covers it|&s;elf; but is never permanent. All deci|duous trees are &s;triped of their leaves; the pa&s;tures become parched and brown; the cane-fields lo&s;e their vivid green, and a&s;|&s;ume the autumnal hue of northern climes. The latter months of this &s;ea&s;on are the mo&s;t plea&s;ant of the year; Nature beginning to recover from the torpor in which &s;he had been &s;unk, gives new life to the whole vegetable creation; and &s;o great is the ve|getative power di&s;played at this period, that leaves and blo&s;&s;oms are &s;een &s;hooting forth on the &s;ame tree, with fruits already formed, and fa&s;t approaching to maturity. Nothing can equal the delightful fre&s;hne&s;s of the mornings, and the &s;oftne&s;s of the evenings

of April and May, in this &s;ea&s;on. The at|mo&s;phere is dry, cool, and &s;aturated with the perfume of a thou&s;and blo&s;&s;oms; ver|dure is univer&s;al, and tempered with the &s;ofte&s;t tints of &s;pring; the winds are gentle and &s;oft, and never charged with the &s;ul|try heats of July.</P>
<P>The rainy &s;ea&s;on includes the &s;ummer, autumn, and generally the fir&s;t month of winter; its approach is awful, and always indicated by thick fog re&s;ting on the tops of the higher mountains; this is &s;oon fol|lowed by heavy, black, watery clouds, &s;lowly rolling along from the north-ea&s;t, in terrific volumes, enveloping the mountains, and darting bright electric coru&s;cations from their edges. The&s;e clouds, &s;ometimes bur&s;t|ing in the mountainous tracts, are &s;uddenly converted into torrents of water, which fre|quently, inundating the country below, commit con&s;iderable deva&s;tation in their progre&s;s; a body of water, not unfrequently &s;ix feet high, rolling down the beds of the rivulets, carries every thing before it, and di&s;colours the &s;ea &s;everal miles in every di|rection from their mouths, with the ochry

earth of the interior country. But although this portion of the year is called the rainy &s;ea&s;on, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from that ju&s;t de|&s;cribed, we are not to imagine that it is compo&s;ed of a continued &s;eries of rainy weather, comfortle&s;s, gloomy, and never brightened by the cheerful-rays of the &s;un. Many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days occur of dry weather; and it &s;ometimes happens, that the length of time without rain endangers the &s;ucce&s;s of the planters exertions. The&s;e dry tracts chiefly occur in Augu&s;t and September, and are almo&s;t un&s;upportably &s;ultry and clo&s;e. The rains fall in a&s;toni&s;hing quantities;&mdash;but as I unfortunately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no means of mea&s;uring it, I cannot with pre|ci&s;ion &s;ay what the average quantity is: no idea however can be formed of it from what falls in Europe. During the rainy &s;ea&s;on, &s;outherly, ea&s;terly, and we&s;terly winds prevail, and are always hot and &s;ultry.</P>
<P>The months of March and September, when the equinoxes happen, are particularly &s;tormy; the winds are uncommonly boi&s;|terous, but generally unaccompanied with

rain. Gu&s;ts &s;uch as are every autumn and &s;pring experienced in the continent of North America, are never known to happen here; and hurricanes, which often lay wa&s;te the &s;i&s;ter colonies to the northward, &s;eldom occur in Grenada; or if they do, they are little more violent than common gales of wind. The dreadful hurricane of the year 1780, which proved &s;o de&s;tructive in Ja|maica, Barbadoes, Antigua, Dominica, St. Vincent, and the French i&s;lands, did no other damage here than throwing down &s;ome trees, and a few old buildings. A few neutral ve&s;&s;els indeed were driven a&s;hore in the carenage; but it was an event to be attributed entirely to the negligence of their captains.</P>
<P>The regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ea and land-breezes, &s;o con&s;tantly ob&s;erved in the larger i&s;lands, and on the continent, never occurs here: but there are two periods in the twenty-four hours, during which there is a perfect calm, and con&s;equently a very di&s;agreeable oppre&s;&s;ive heat, from eight till ten in the morning, and from two till four in the afternoon.</P>

That northerly and ea&s;terly winds are the mo&s;t prevalent, is demon&s;trated by the manner in which all the trees on the ea&s;t|ern &s;ide of the mountains are bent: they are all, particularly tho&s;e growing on the mo&s;t expo&s;ed &s;ituations, &s;tinted and dwarf; and their branches are inclined to the &s;outh|we&s;t. Next to the&s;e is the &s;outherly; and the lea&s;t frequent is the we&s;terly.</P>
<P>Lightning, and its con&s;equence thunder, are phenomena not &s;o frequent in Grena|da as the &s;ituation of the i&s;land and its high conical mountains might induce us to expect; nor are the fla&s;hes and the explo|&s;ions &s;o tremendous, by any means, as they are in the &s;outhern &s;tates of North America. It &s;eldom happens that lightning is the cau&s;e of much mi&s;chief here; for in the cour&s;e of twelve years, I know of only two in&s;tances of its mi&s;chievous effects. In the dry &s;ea&s;on they never occur: they are ge|nerally preceded by whiti&s;h clouds hang|ing on the &s;ides and tops of the mountains, in the form of huge bales; and fleecy clouds di&s;per&s;ed in various forms throughout the &s;ky. Southerly winds accompany them ge|nerally.</P>

The thermometer I u&s;ed is a mercurial one, graduated by Fahrenheit's &s;cale, and mode by Fra&s;er, London. The hall in which it hung is reckoned one of the coole&s;t rooms in St. George's, &s;ituated on the &s;um|mit of the part of the town called The Hill: it was almo&s;t con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to a cur|rent of air, which pa&s;&s;ed between the door and one of the windward windows; and the height of the mercury in the tube was almo&s;t always taken at 7 A. M. at 1 P. M. and at 10 P. M. The choice of the&s;e pe|riods in the twenty-four hours, aro&s;e from my ob&s;ervation of the following fact: At 7 A. M. the heat begins to increa&s;e, and continues to do &s;o till 1 P. M.; from which time till 4 P. M. it is &s;tationary; it then begins to dimini&s;h, and continues to do &s;o till about 10 P. M.; from which till 7 A. M. it is again &s;tationary. This routine of tem|perature is di&s;turbed only when any re|markable change takes place in the atmo|&s;phere, &s;uch as much rain, attended with &s;trong wind; and during &s;ome part of the dry &s;ea&s;on, when, as I have already ob|&s;erved, &s;outh-ea&s;terly winds are &s;ucceeded at night by northerly ones. Thus, from
<PB N="50" REF="035302_0065_10021841903BF5C8">
the latter cau&s;e, the thermometer &s;inks in the cour&s;e of the night two, three, or four degrees; &s;o that when it is 80 at 10 P.M. it will be only 76, 77, or 78, at 7 of the following morning, in January, February, and March. A fall of rain, accompanied with wind, has a very remarkable effect on the thermometer. The greate&s;t change I ever ob&s;erved was ten degrees; the lea&s;t, four; &s;o that the medium may be about &s;even degrees. The&s;e changes are mo&s;t fre|quent in the &s;ummer and autumnal months, when the rains fall in greate&s;t abundance: and when there is often an alternate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of rain with cold, and dry weather with heat. It may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, however, that during rain, &s;hould the atmo&s;phere remain &s;till, the thermome|ter continues at the &s;ame height as before it began to rain. I have repeatedly ob&s;erved this, even when the quantity of rain has been very con&s;iderable; and it is a pheno|menon which &s;hould not &s;urpri&s;e us, &s;ince we know the great &s;hare which winds, or currents of air, have in evaporation, and this in the production of cold.<NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">See E&s;&s;ays and Ob&s;ervations, Phy&s;ical and Literary, Vol. II. p. 159.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="035302_0066_1002184324C3DD80">
When I have expo&s;ed the thermometer to the direct rays of the &s;un, in an inclo&s;ed yard, where the wind could have little effect upon it, the mercury has ri&s;en in ten minutes to 130 degrees, or 42 degrees above its &s;tationary point at noon, in the hall where the in&s;trument was before &s;u&s;p&eacute;nded; but as the reflection from the walls of the yard might con&s;iderably increa&s;e the heat, I did not con&s;ider this as a fair trial of the natural heat of the &s;un. I have there|fore frequently, on clear days, &s;u&s;pended the thermometer in a gallery, directly expo&s;ed to the &s;un's rays, and found that the mer|cury ro&s;e to 113 degrees, and once to 120 degrees at noon, or generally about 30 de|grees above the u&s;ual height in the &s;hade at noon.</P>
<P>Another thing to be ob&s;erved, is the dif|ference between the heat of the air at the hotte&s;t time of the day, and during the night; or the periods during which the thermometer is generally &s;tationary. The medium of the heat in the &s;hade at noon, or 1 P. M. is about 83, 30; at night 74; &s;o that in general the difference is about
<PB N="52" REF="035302_0067_10021845816F10C0">
9 degrees. I have not found that the de|gree of heat in the ground, and fir&s;t floors of my hou&s;e, differed much from that in the upper, which was covered with a tiled roof: and con&s;equently the air contained in it we would expect &s;hould be more af|fected by the heat of the &s;un than the lower floors. In general, this difference has never exceeded 1 degree.</P>
<P>I may here take notice of the difference of temperature produced in water, by the heat of the atmo&s;phere, during the day and night. It &s;hews how extremely &s;en&s;ible the human body is to the &s;malle&s;t deviation, from the u&s;ual heat it is expo&s;ed to; and that our &s;en&s;e of cold, in this climate, is merely relative. At 10 P. M. into a Spa|ni&s;h unglazed earthen guglet (of that kind generally u&s;ed here for cooling water) full of water, I plunged a &s;mall thermometer: in five minutes the mercury &s;unk 3 degrees, its &s;tationary point then, in the open air, being 82 degrees. I then placed the guglet in an open window, where it was left till 6 A. M. On plunging the thermometer into the water, the mercury &s;unk to 72 degrees, or 10 degrees lower than its &s;ta|tionary
<PB N="53" REF="035302_0068_1002184896210618">
point during the night. This de|gree of coolne&s;s in the water was, to my ta&s;te, rather cold and chilling. At 1 P. M. I plunged the thermometer into a guglet of water which had been &s;tanding in the &s;hade all the forenoon, when the mercury fell to 82 degrees, or 2 degrees lower than the heat of the room at that time. It is to be ob&s;erved, that the guglets u&s;ed here, for the purpo&s;e of cooling water, are brought from South America, are porous, and of cour&s;e a con&s;iderable evaporation takes place from all their external &s;urface.</P>
<P>It is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing that this coun|try &s;hould be &s;ubject to earthquakes. The conical hills and mountains into which the &s;urface of the i&s;land is divided; the lakes<NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">One of the&s;e, called the Grand Etang, or Great Lake, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from another on the windward &s;ide of the i&s;land, is &s;ituated in a circular ba&s;on, cut out of the &s;ummit of the highe&s;t mountain of the i&s;land. It is about a mile in circumference; and its depth is, in general, about 14 feet. The other, called the Lake of the River Antoine, retains the appearance of an extingui&s;hed volcano, much more perfectly than the Grand Etang. The hollow which contains it is perfectly circular, and gradually &s;lopes from the brim to the edge of the water, which is of very con&s;i|derable depth.</NOTE>

contained in what have every appearance of having been once the craters of immen&s;e volcanos; the regular horizontal &s;trata of the &s;ub&s;tance called Tuf, which &s;eems &s;till to retain many of the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of lava; the&s;e and &s;everal other peculiarities to be ob&s;erved in the &s;tructure of this as well as mo&s;t of the windward i&s;lands, give us room to believe that volcanos did once exi&s;t in them; and we know that where volcanos are, or have been, earth|quakes are very frequent. In the cour&s;e of the three fir&s;t years of my re&s;idence in Grenada, there were five earthquakes. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t violent happened on the 22d of December, 1784, about 2 P. M. In St. George's it continued about a minute and a half, and ran from about N. N. W. to S. S. E. It &s;hook the earth in a violent manner, and when &s;tronge&s;t, occa&s;ioned an undulating motion of the &s;urface. It was attended with a hollow rumbling noi&s;e, like di&s;tant thunder. The atmo&s;phere was &s;till and clo&s;e while it la&s;ted; the thermometer 82. The &s;ea did not appear to be in the lea&s;t agitated. The mar&s;hes at Calivini were much agitated by it; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> of their

&s;urface was perceived to be very great, and to continue &s;ome time after the &s;hock cea&s;ed. On the windward &s;ide of the i&s;land, the &s;hock continued about two minutes; and was much more violent than in town. The captain of a &s;hip, at that time off the coa&s;t of the i&s;land, &s;aid, the &s;en&s;ation which the &s;hock occa&s;ioned on board, was &s;imilar to that of the &s;hip's bottom rubbing again&s;t rocks; but that the &s;ea was not agitated. The &s;ame was ob&s;erved by &s;ome gentlemen going to Cariacou. On the 24th of April, 1785, about 40 minutes pa&s;t &s;ix A. M. a &s;hock of an earthquake was felt, which la&s;ted only about two &s;econds; but about 20 &s;econds after, a &s;econd was felt, which continued a little longer. It was very gentle, was not general, and appeared to run from N. N. W. to S. S. E. The morn|ing was calm. On the 26th of May, about midnight, a &s;hock was generally felt, run|ning from about W. to E.; it continued about 30 &s;econds, and &s;hook the hou&s;es very con&s;iderably. On the 29th of the &s;ame month, about 10 P. M. another &s;hock was generally felt, and continued about 20 &s;econds. And on the 16th of January,
<PB N="56" REF="035302_0071_1002184E298F8AA8">
1786, in the morning, three &s;hocks were perceived running from N. N. W. to S. S. E. the two fir&s;t were very &s;light; but the third was violent. During the &s;even la&s;t years, not a &s;ingle &s;hock has occurred: an extraordinary circum&s;tance, con&s;idering their frequency in the preceding years. In tho&s;e i&s;lands, however, on which the volcanic appearances are more perfect than they are here, &s;uch as St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and Dominica, earthquakes are much more fre|quent and violent.</P>
<P>Water-&s;pouts are very rarely &s;een around Grenada; for during the la&s;t ten years, I re|collect only two.</P>
<P>The barometer does not appear to be affected much in this climate. A moi&s;t at|mo&s;phere, with &s;outherly and we&s;terly winds, makes the mercury to &s;ink a little; and northerly winds, with a dry cold at|mo&s;phere, make it ri&s;e. But notwith&s;tanding the irregularity of temperature, and the moi&s;|ture which (prevails more or le&s;s throughout the whole year here) of the atmo&s;phere, the greate&s;t range of the barometer during

any year, has not exceeded one inch and five-tenths. This is, however, con&s;iderably greater than that which happens at Bar|badoes, where the greate&s;t range is not more than half an inch. In uncommon years, when a long continuance of northerly winds produces a degree of cold in the atmo&s;phere extremely di&s;agreeable to our feelings, the barometer has &s;tood for a month together at 30 degrees. In the months of July and Augu&s;t, when much rain falls, it has con|tinued at 28: 5 &s;everal days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and the atmo&s;phere then is in&s;ufferably clo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned, that it was not in my power to determine the quantity of rain, owing to my not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the proper in&s;truments; but with a view to remedy this defect, I have, following the example of the late Dr. Cleghorn in his account of the weather at Minorca, marked the rainy days, and the proportion they bore to each other, by dots.

<HEAD>AN ESSAY, ON THE MALIGNANT PESTILENTIAL FEVER, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere between the tropics, does not &s;eem to admit of the generation of a high degree of con|tagion; and wherever &s;uch exi&s;ts, it mu&s;t ari&s;e from the mo&s;t unpardonable neglect of cleanline&s;s, and the retention of contagi|ous effluvia from a total want of ventila|tion. The heat and con&s;equent rarefaction of the air in hot climates, where due atten|tion is paid to cleanline&s;s and ventilation, mu&s;t prevent infection; and it is probable, that it is only where there is not a &s;uf|ficient number of people to render, by their exertions, the places they inhabit, clean and &s;weet, that infection takes place and is retained. The ob&s;ervation made by Dr.
<PB N="80" REF="035302_0095_1002188DC2CF48B8">
Blane on this &s;ubject, is, in many re&s;pects, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and may be confirmed by that of every intelligent practitioner in this country. He &s;ays, "there is rea&s;on to think that the open air very &s;oon di&s;&s;ipates, and renders inert all infections of the volatile kind; and of cour&s;e, the warmer the air is, the more readily it will have this effect. It is accordingly ob&s;erved, that infection is much le&s;s apt to be generated about the per&s;ons of men, and that it adheres to them for a much le&s;s &s;pace of time in a hot climate than in a cold or temperate one."<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on the Di&s;ea&s;es of Seamen, p. 277.</NOTE> If in|fection, or rather the contagion ari&s;ing from accumulated human effluvia, is produced only in &s;ituations wherein many are crowded together in a comparatively &s;mall &s;pace, it becomes a que&s;tion of no &s;mall importance, why malignant and infectious fevers are never, or very &s;eldom, generated on board &s;lave-&s;hips. In the&s;e the number is much greater than tran&s;ports, or &s;hips hired for the purpo&s;e of emigration, ever contain: the &s;laves, in order to prevent in|&s;urrection, are generally kept below, &s;ome|times

in irons, particularly during the night: the &s;mell between decks is intolerably offen|&s;ive to tho&s;e not accu&s;tomed to it. Infection, however, is prevented, where &s;o many cau&s;es combine to produce it, by the following means: The crew of a &s;lave-&s;hip is gene|rally very numerous; whereby the ri&s;k, &s;hould in&s;urrection happen, is much le&s;|&s;ened, and the attention to the &s;laves is proportionally increa&s;ed: the &s;pace be|tween decks is regularly wa&s;hed every day, if the weather permits: the &s;laves are, in parties of thirty or forty, taken on deck in fine weather, their irons taken off, and they are encouraged, by every po&s;&s;ible means, to exerci&s;e them&s;elves by dancing: they have no cloathing to which infectious particles can adhere: their per&s;ons are frequently wa&s;hed: their diet is always compo&s;ed of vegetables, without any mixture of animal food, and &s;ea&s;oned highly with cap&s;icum: their drink is water: and &s;cuttles are cut in the &s;ides of the &s;hip, by means of which, and wind&s;ails when they can be u&s;ed, there is kept up a con&s;tant change of air, and as free a ventilation as the &s;ituation can admit of. But in every &s;ituation wherein the ge|neration
<PB N="82" REF="035302_0097_10021892D3019DA8">
of infection is po&s;&s;ible, the pre|vention of it is proportional to the degree of intere&s;t of tho&s;e who have the direction and command. In &s;hips of war, in mer|chant &s;hips, in tran&s;ports, and in &s;hips hired for emigration, the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who command extends not beyond the opera|tion of a &s;en&s;e of duty; of cour&s;e we find it generally weak: it is rare, indeed, to meet an in&s;tance of the contrary; but where we do, the effect is con&s;picuous. In &s;lave-&s;hips, the profits of the captain and &s;urgeon are more or le&s;s, according to the number brought to market and actually &s;old; hence their intere&s;t in their welfare is great, and their exertions to maintain it are proportional. It is di&s;graceful that 
  
  <Q>quaerenda pecunia primum, virtus po&s;t nummos,</Q>
  
&s;hould be in all ages the pre|vailing maxim of mankind.</P>
<P>In &s;hips therefore in which the captains are not urged to prevent infection by mo|tives of intere&s;t, fevers of a malignant and pe&s;tilential nature may be generated, even in hot climates. A &s;hip of this de&s;cription in|troduced the very fatal fever which raged

in the port and town of St. George, during &s;everal months of the year 1793. The circum&s;tances of this &s;hip are in many re|&s;pects &s;ingular. The following account I was favoured with by a gentleman,<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Mr. J. Paiba.</NOTE> who was one of the adventurers in the Boullam Scheme, and who, de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s, left the coa&s;t of Africa in this &s;hip.</P>
<P>The Hankey &s;ailed from England, in company with another &s;hip, both chartered by the Sierra Leona company, loaded with &s;tores and adventurers for the projected co|lony at Boullam, about the beginning of the month of April, 1792. When the&s;e &s;hips &s;ailed, and during the voyage out, the crews and &s;ettlers were all healthy; and as the latter were in general of the middling cla&s;s of people, and appeared to be induced to &s;ettle in this new country, more from the delu&s;ive pro&s;pect of wealth held out to them, and the fanatic enthu&s;ia&s;m for the Abolition of the Slave Trade of the mo|ment, than by any deprivation of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in their own country, no &s;u&s;|picion

whatever can be entertained of the exi&s;tence of latent infection among them; nor can mar&s;h effluvia be &s;uppo&s;ed as the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e which afterwards &s;wept off &s;o many of tho&s;e unhappy people. Boul|lam being &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, enjoys all the advantages of the &s;ea-breeze; and be|ing dry, and not incommoded by any mar&s;hy tracts, it is con&s;idered as the healthie&s;t &s;pot on the windward coa&s;t.<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">This part of Africa is allowed, by all who have vi&s;ited it, to be uncommonly healthy and plea&s;ant. I have conver&s;ed with &s;everal intelligent captains of &s;lave-&s;hips, who have uniformly agreed in this point: and indeed the appearance of the &s;laves brought from the windward coa&s;t, part of which this is, con&s;titutes a convincing proof of the &s;alubrity of the climate. Many travellers have given their te&s;timony to this effect: the Chevalier de Marchais, in particular, is very full of its prai&s;e: "Le lit de cette riviere (Sierra Leona) renferme quantit&eacute; d'i&s;les d'un terrein par|faitement bon, gras et profond qui produit de lui-meme et pre&s;que &s;ans culture tout ce-qui e&s;t nece&s;&s;aire &aacute; la vie&mdash;Mais ce qu'on ne &s;&ccedil;auroit e&s;timer a&s;&s;ez, c'e&s;t que l'air y e&s;t tr&egrave;s pur, et qu'on n'y e&s;t point &s;ujet &agrave; ces maladies violentes et dangereu&s;es qui regnent &agrave; la Cot&eacute; de Guin&eacute;e et qui ont fait perir tant d'Europ&eacute;ens.

It appears to be nearly cir|cular, about 15 miles long, and 15 broad; and con&s;e|quently about 45 round.</NOTE> It

is not inhabited, but occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited by the natives of the adjoining continent, who have &s;mall &s;cattered patches of millet on it. It is, however, de&s;titute of fre&s;h water; and that, procured by digging tem|porary wells on the beech, is bracki&s;h, and con&s;equently unwhole&s;ome. The negroes of this part of Africa are ferocious in an extraordinary degree; and are even &s;aid to be cannibals. This circum&s;tance prevent|ing the erection of any &s;ort of accommo|dation on &s;hore, during the nine months the Hankey lay there, the &s;ettlers were obliged to live on board; and the rainy &s;ea&s;on coming on almo&s;t immediately after their arrival, and the heat being at the &s;ame time exce&s;&s;ively great, they endeavoured to &s;helter them&s;elves from both, by rai&s;ing the &s;ides of the &s;hip &s;everal feet, and covering her with a wooden roof.</P>

Among upwards of two hundred people, of whom women and children con&s;tituted a part, thus confined in a &s;ultry, moi&s;t at|mo&s;phere, cleanline&s;s could not be well at|tended to, however well-inclined the people them&s;elves might be. The&s;e circum&s;tances, joined to the depre&s;&s;ion of mind con&s;equent upon their di&s;appointment, mu&s;t certainly be con&s;idered as the cau&s;es of the malignant fever which broke out among tho&s;e unfor|tunate people, &s;ome time after their arrival at Boullam. And no doubt can be enter|tained, that neglecting to &s;weeten the &s;hip, to ventilate her afterwards, and to de&s;troy the clothes, bedding, &amp;c. of tho&s;e who died on board, was the &s;ole cau&s;e of her retaining the &s;eeds of infection when &s;he arrived at this port. The following facts will &s;erve to illu&s;trate this: Capt. Coxe, finding the water at Boullam unwhole&s;ome, proceeded with his &s;hip to Bi&s;&s;ao, where there is a Portugue&s;e &s;ettlement, for a &s;upply. The &s;hip was navigated by about twelve &s;eamen, mo&s;t of whom had not experienced &s;ickne&s;s, and had been probably procured from Sierra Leone: at any rate they were then taken on board for the fir&s;t time. Of the&s;e,
<PB N="87" REF="035302_0102_1002189D354E5108">
before the return of the Hankey to Boullam, nine died; and the remainder, with the captain, were reduced to a deplorable &s;tate. The time for which the Hankey was char|tered being expired, Mr. Paiba, with his family, intended to return to England in her; but as no &s;eamen could be procured, they were obliged to proceed to &s;ea, having on board the captain &s;ick, and only the mate, Mr. Paiba, and two &s;eamen to navigate the &s;hip. With much difficulty they arrived at St. Jago, where they fortunately found the Charon and Scorpion &s;hips of war. Capt. Dodd, of the former, humanely rendered them every &s;ervice in his power; and on leaving them, put two men of each &s;hip on board the Hankey. With this aid they proceeded to the We&s;t-Indies; a voyage to England being impracticable in their wretched &s;tate. On the third day after leav|ing St. Jago, the men they procured from the &s;hips of war were &s;eized with the fever, which had carried off three-fourths of tho&s;e on board the Hankey at Boullam; and having no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, two of the four died: the remaining two were put on &s;hore here in the mo&s;t wretched &s;tate po&s;&s;ible.

Capt. Dodd, on his arrival at Barbadoes from the coa&s;t of Africa, was ordered by Admiral Gardener to convoy the homeward-bound fleet of merchantmen. In the ex|ecution of his orders, he came to Grenada on the 27th of May, and hearing of the mi&s;chief which the Hankey had been the cau&s;e of, mentioned that &s;everal of the Cha|ron's and Scorpion's people were &s;ent on board the Hankey at St. Jago, to repair her rigging, &amp;c. that from this circum|&s;tance, and the communication which his barge's crew had with that &s;hip, the pe&s;ti|lence was brought on board both &s;hips; and that of the Charon's crew thirty died; and of the Scorpion's about fifteen. The Han|key arrived at the Port of St. George on the 19th of February, in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation; and for a few days lay in the Bay, but was afterwards brought into the Carenage.<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Our Lieut. Governor, Ninian Home, E&s;q. &s;ome|time after the di&s;ea&s;e became epidemic, informed me, that in con&s;equence of the information he had received of the clothes, &amp;c. of the victims of the &s;ever at Boul|lam being &s;till on board the Hankey, he ordered Capt. Coxe to be brought before him and &s;ome gentlemen of the council, &amp;c. He then acknowledged that all the effects of tho&s;e who had died were then on board his &s;hip; and &s;aid, that he would not de&s;troy them, unle&s;s he was indemnified for the lo&s;s he might &s;u&s;tain, &s;hould the heirs of the decea&s;ed call on him for tho&s;e effects. Every argument was u&s;ed to induce him to de&s;troy the articles, but the only one which influences a man of this de&s;cription, Indemnification; and be of cour&s;e carried the &s;eminium of the di&s;ea&s;e to England when the Hankey &s;ailed with a convoy in July. Mr. Hume was &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with the idea of the danger which Capt. Coxe's conduct might be productive of on the arrival of the &s;hip in England, that he wrote to the Secretary of State, &s;tating the danger. Proper notice of this repre&s;entation was taken by Government; for the Hankey, I under&s;tand, was obliged to perform quarantine.</NOTE></P>

<P>The manner in which this di&s;ea&s;e was fir&s;t communicated, and its &s;ub&s;equent pro|gre&s;s, too clearly evinced its malignant and pe&s;tilential nature. A Capt. Remington, an intimate acquaintance of Capt. Coxe's,
<PB N="90" REF="035302_0105_100218A368325050">
was the fir&s;t per&s;on who vi&s;ited the Han|key, after her arrival in St. George's Bay. This per&s;on went on board of her in the evening after &s;he anchored, and remained three days; at the end of which time he left St. George's, and proceeded in a Drogher<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">A coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;el.</NOTE> to Grenville Bay, where his &s;hip, the Ad|venture, lay. He was &s;eized with the ma|lignant pe&s;tilential fever on the pa&s;&s;age; and the violence of the &s;ymptoms increa&s;ed &s;o rapidly, as, on the third day, to put an end to his exi&s;tence. The crew of the Defiance of Blythe port, near Newca&s;tle, were the next who &s;uffered by vi&s;iting this &s;hip: the mate, boat&s;wain, and four &s;ailors went on board the day after her arrival: the mate re|mained either on deck or in the cabin, but the re&s;t went below, and &s;taid all night there. All of them were immediately &s;eized with the fever, and died in three days. The mate was al&s;o taken ill, but, probably from his having been le&s;s expo&s;ed to the virulence of the infection, he recovered. The crew of the &s;hip Baillies, from the &s;ame impru|dent civility or curio&s;ity, were the next
<PB N="91" REF="035302_0106_100218A59C405490">
who &s;uffered. The&s;e communicated the in|fection to the &s;hips neare&s;t them; and it gradually &s;pread from tho&s;e neare&s;t the mouth of the Carenage, where the Hankey for &s;ome time lay, to tho&s;e at the bottom of it; not one e&s;caping, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, whatever means the captains took to prevent it; even the &s;mell and &s;moke of coal-tar, which is un|commonly pungent and penetrating, had no effect as a preventive; for the Hope of Lon|don, then careening, and having her bot|tom paid with this bitumen, received the infection as exten&s;ively as the others, al|though none of her crew died of it. In the &s;hort &s;pace of time from the beginning of March to the end of May, 200 of about 500 &s;ailors, who manned the &s;hips in the regular trade, died of this fever. If to the&s;e we add, tho&s;e who &s;uffered on board Guinea-&s;hips, and other tran&s;ient ve&s;&s;els, the num|ber cannot fall &s;hort of 250; which is nearly one in three, or a third of all the &s;ailors du|ring about ten weeks in harbour. From the beginning of June till the middle of Augu&s;t, when the di&s;ea&s;e had nearly di&s;|appeared, the number of &s;ailors was con&s;i|derably dimini&s;hed, by two fleets having
<PB N="92" REF="035302_0107_100218A894A556E0">
&s;ailed for Europe, but the mortality was proportionably great. Although &s;o great a mortality naturally leads us to form a dread|ful idea of the virulence of the contagion which gave ri&s;e to it, it mu&s;t not remain uncon&s;idered, that the predi&s;po&s;ition of the cla&s;s of men among whom it happened, was very great. The &s;ailors were men from the age of fifteen to fifty; and the circum|&s;tances which appeared to predi&s;po&s;e them more &s;trongly than other men to the action of the contagion, were violent exerci&s;e in the &s;un; the immoderate u&s;e of undiluted new rum; bathing in a &s;tate of intoxication, and often when violently heated; &s;leeping on deck during the night. Other circum|&s;tances which did not depend &s;o much on their own prudence, no doubt, contributed very much to give the di&s;ea&s;e &s;o very fatal a tendency: the damp heat between decks; the exce&s;&s;ive filth of mo&s;t of the &s;hips; and the uncleanly &s;tate of the per&s;ons and clothes of the men them&s;elves.</P>
<P>About the middle of April the di&s;ea&s;e be|gan to appear on &s;hore. The fir&s;t hou&s;e it &s;hewed it&s;elf in, was that of Me&s;&s;rs. Stowe-wood
<PB N="93" REF="035302_0108_100218AA290DA0D8">
and Co. &s;ituated clo&s;e to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and the infection was evidently introduced by a negro-wench, who took in &s;ailors clothes to wa&s;h. The whole of the fa|mily were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively afflicted with it; and by them communicated to all tho&s;e with whom they had any intercour&s;e. The dif|ference of temperature, and free circula|tion of air; the temperament of the inha|bitants, in general, le&s;s di&s;po&s;ing them to be acted on by the contagion; the &s;uperior care and attention to cleanline&s;s, rendered the fever infinitely milder when it ap|peared among the inhabitants. The man|ner, however, in which it &s;pread in town, clearly evinced its contagious nature; for all who from friend&s;hip, bu&s;ine&s;s, or duty, communicated with the di&s;ea&s;ed, were them|&s;elves infected: and no in&s;tance occurred wherein the contagion could not be traced to its particular &s;ource. A few, who more &s;edulou&s;ly avoided the hou&s;es where the infected actually were, e&s;caped: but all the means which come under the general de|&s;ignation of Prophylactics, were, as may be readily conceived, totally inefficacious. Of the&s;e, the celebrated "Vinaigre de quatre
<PB N="94" REF="035302_0109_100218ABD41553B0">
Voleurs," or the Acetum Aromaticum of the Ed. Ph. was generally u&s;ed, and always without &s;ucce&s;s. Camphor, &s;ewed into a &s;mall linen bag, and hung round the neck, was another of this tribe; but equally in|effectual. It will not appear extraordinary, that the lower cla&s;&s;es of men, and tho&s;e more e&s;pecially of loo&s;e and debauched man|ners, &s;hould be the mo&s;t &s;ubject to this di&s;|ea&s;e; their greater expo&s;ition to the influ|ence of infection, which their bu&s;ine&s;s as trade&s;men rendered nece&s;&s;ary, contributed al&s;o not a little. But the de&s;cription of men by far the mo&s;t obnoxious to this con|tagion, and who &s;uffered mo&s;t from it, were tho&s;e lately arrived from Europe; and of them, tho&s;e who had never before been in a hot climate. In general, tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ten&s;e fibres and &s;anguineous tempera|ment, were the mo&s;t readily infected; and among whom the di&s;ea&s;e was mo&s;t fatal. It is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain with preci&s;ion the number of the infected among the in|habitants, and the proportion of the deaths to that, or to the general number of white males and females in St. George's; but where certainty is not, conjecture, on good grounds,
<PB N="95" REF="035302_0110_100218AEB26E7620">
may be admitted. We may therefore &s;ay, that the proportion which the deaths bore to the &s;ick, might have been about one to five; and the &s;ick to the total number of white inhabitants, about one to about one and a half.</P>
<P>That part of the garri&s;on quartered neare&s;t to where the Hankey lay, were the fir&s;t of this cla&s;s of men who received the infection. A barrack, containing nearly one-half of the 45th regiment, was &s;ituated exactly to leeward of the Hankey, and di&s;tant from her about two hundred yards. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this circum&s;tance alone could be productive of a di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;ing from contagion; but it was &s;o in a &s;econdary manner, by exciting the curio&s;ity of &s;ome of the officers. One of the&s;e vi&s;ited the Hankey, and, with two or three &s;oldiers who rowed his boat, remained on board &s;ome time. The con&s;equence of this im|prudence was fatal to him&s;elf almo&s;t im|mediately after; and, in a little time, to many of the men: all the officers and men were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e; but it proved fatal only to recruits who had

lately joined. The &s;trength of the regi|ment at this time was 280, and of the&s;e 24 died; &s;o that the proportion was one to &s;omething le&s;s than twelve. The &s;mall|ne&s;s of this proportion aro&s;e from the mode of treatment; as will be &s;hewn hereafter.</P>
<P>About the beginning of May, the di&s;|ea&s;e made its appearance in the detachment of Royal Artillery: a circum&s;tance rather extraordinary, as that corps were quartered in a &s;ituation far removed from the focus of infection. It was evidently produced, how|ever, by the communication which the gunners, doing duty in Fort George, had with the 45th regiment; and the predi&s;|po&s;ition of the men to receive infection as far as that could be induced by exce&s;&s;es in drinking, and other irregularities, was by no means le&s;s than that of the &s;ailors and &s;ol|diers of the 45th regiment. Of 84 people belonging to the ordnance department at that time, about 56 were &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e before the fir&s;t of July, and of the&s;e five died: a trifling mortality, con&s;idering the nature of the complaint. All the&s;e men, however, had been about three years
<PB N="97" REF="035302_0112_100218B27AC7ED88">
in the country, and con&s;equently &s;uffered le&s;s from the di&s;ea&s;e, than about 27 re|cruits who joined the artillery in July. Of 26 of the&s;e unfortunate men who were infected, 21 died before the middle of Augu&s;t: a dreadful in&s;tance of its peculiar tendency to prove fatal to &s;trangers to the climate.</P>
<P>About the fir&s;t of June, the di&s;ea&s;e began to appear among the negroes of the e&s;tates in the neighbourhood of town; and the alarm this occa&s;ioned was in proportion to the intere&s;t of tho&s;e concerned in the &s;afety and welfare of the &s;laves; but our apprehen&s;ions were &s;oon found groundle&s;s; for the di&s;ea&s;e did not &s;pread much among them, nor was it marked with the fatality which attended it when it appeared among the whites. In the cour&s;e of a month its progre&s;s was &s;o trifling, that only about one in four was &s;eized with it; and the proportion of its mortality was &s;till more trifling, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> one to 83. It is more than pro|bable, that had not this di&s;ea&s;e been &s;uper|added to the cacochymic complaint, called in this country Mal d'E&s;tomac, in the two
<PB N="98" REF="035302_0113_100218B41728A660">
ca&s;es which terminated fatally, there would have been no mortality at all occa&s;ioned by it.</P>
<P>About the middle of June, the di&s;ea&s;e broke out in the 67th regiment; and among the artificers and labourers on Richmond-hill. The infection was communicated by &s;ome of the latter, who had vi&s;ited their friends in town labouring under it. All were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;eized with it; but it fell heavier on the officers than the men, &s;everal of the former being young men lately ar|rived from Europe. The proportion of deaths was about one to fifteen.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e in the cour&s;e of the months of May, June, and July, appeared in &s;everal di&s;tinct and di&s;tant parts of the country, whither the infection was carried by per|&s;ons who had imprudently vi&s;ited infected hou&s;es in town.</P>
<P>But the infection was not confined to Grenada alone; from this, as a focus, it &s;pread to the other i&s;lands, to Jamaica, St. Domingo, and Philadelphia, by means of
<PB N="99" REF="035302_0114_100218B653C1A5D0">
ve&s;&s;els on board of which the infection was retained by the clothes, more e&s;pecially the woollen jackets of the decea&s;ed &s;ailors.</P>
<P>I have been thus particular in &s;tating the progre&s;s of this malignant pe&s;tilential fever, chiefly with a view to demon&s;trate, 1&s;t, That it was uncommonly infectious. 2d, That it aro&s;e from human contagion, heightened by various cau&s;es to a pe&s;tilential degree of violence. And 3d, That, like the plague, it has been communicated, in every in&s;tance, either by actual contact with an infected per&s;on; or, by breathing air charged with effluvia per&s;pired or di&s;charged from the lungs of an infected per&s;on; or by touching the clothes of or &s;leeping in a place where an infected per&s;on had been.</P>
<P>It is curious, and may be u&s;eful, to ob|&s;erve the gradation of this fatal malady, with re&s;pect to the various de&s;criptions of people expo&s;ed to its infection. Neither age nor &s;ex were exempted from its attack; but &s;ome were more obnoxious to it than others; and the colour had evidently much influence in determining its violence. The &s;cale of
<PB N="100" REF="035302_0115_100218B94ECF0BD0">
its violence, or the gradation it ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to the different cla&s;&s;es of the inhabitants, appeared to be the following:</P>

It had been urged by &s;ome, that the di&s;|ea&s;e aro&s;e from the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere; and that human contagion could not give ri&s;e to it, as it was &s;o prevalent in di&s;tant and di&s;tinct places at the &s;ame time. That this opinion was without foundation, mu&s;t evidently appear from the foregoing narra|tive: but had there been no other proofs of its contagious nature, the &s;tate of the weather alone during the months of Fe|bruary, March, April, May, June, July, and Augu&s;t, will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew that the temperature of the air could not produce an epidemic of &s;o uncommon a character. The weather, though previous to the appearance of this di&s;ea&s;e much more wet and boi&s;t|erous than is u&s;ual at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, was, after it broke out, mild; and would rather have tended to check than promote infection, if that had been of a na|ture to be affected by &s;uch an agent. The two fir&s;t months of the year were almo&s;t con&s;tantly rainy. The latter part of March, all April, and the fir&s;t fifteen days of May, were dry, with the wind generally at ea&s;t. The thermometer never ro&s;e higher than 87, nor fell lower than 85. Almo&s;t all the re|mainder
<PB N="104" REF="035302_0119_100218C0EF1E2A10">
of May was rainy, with &s;ome|times thunder and lightning. In June the quantity of rain was much greater. As the change to moi&s;ture was remarkably &s;udden and great, much expectation was formed that the virulence of the infection would be done away, or con&s;iderably abated; but as neither happened, the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible argument was afforded again&s;t the agency of the weather in the production of the di&s;ea&s;e. In June the thermometer, more than once, fell to 77 at noon; and ro&s;e once as high as 88. All July was rainy al&s;o, with boi&s;terous wind from N. E. and much thunder and lightning; thermometer highe&s;t 88, lowe&s;t 77. In Augu&s;t le&s;s rain fell; but the atmo&s;phere was generally clo&s;e and &s;ultry; wind variable, but chiefly S. and W. Thermometer highe&s;t 89, lowe&s;t 80.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects of this di&s;ea&s;e may be di|vided into three cla&s;&s;es; but differing from each other only in the degree of violence of the &s;ymptoms; and from the &s;cale or gra|dation already given, it will readily appear that the three fir&s;t de&s;criptions of men con|&s;titute
<PB N="105" REF="035302_0120_100218C286FCF0C0">
the fir&s;t cla&s;s; the 4th and 5th the &s;econd; and the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th the third. To avoid repetition, I &s;hall fir&s;t de|&s;cribe it as it appeared in tho&s;e &s;eized with it in its mo&s;t violent and fatal form; and afterwards treat more particularly of its mo&s;t remarkable &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>The patient, without any previous com|plaint, &s;uddenly becomes giddy; he lo&s;es his eye-&s;ight; every thing &s;eems to move round him with inconceivable velocity; he falls down almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, and in that &s;tate remains half an hour or upwards. During this paroxy&s;m the body feels cold, and is over&s;pread with cold &s;weat, which i&s;&s;ues from every pore in a&s;toni&s;hing abundance. On his recovery, the cold goes off, and is in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded by inten&s;e heat, and quick, &s;mall, hard pul&s;e; the head achs dreadfully, particularly the forehead and &s;inciput, which is generally accompanied with pain in the right &s;ide, and at the prae|cordia. The la&s;t, however, has never been acute, and may rather be called oppre&s;&s;ion than pain. The eyes are much inflamed, watery, protruded, and wildly rolling; the
<PB N="106" REF="035302_0121_100218C4CE931C10">
face much flu&s;hed; much heat is felt at the pit of the &s;tomach; and that organ &s;eems to be con&s;iderably affected by the nau&s;ea and frequent retching and vomiting, which then come on. The patient &s;oon after com|plains of intolerable pain in the &s;mall of his back, and in the calves of his legs; but the la&s;t appears to be the mo&s;t violent, During twelve, eighteen, twenty-four, or thirty-&s;ix hours, the&s;e &s;ymptoms continue increa&s;ing, except the quickne&s;s and hard|ne&s;s of the pul&s;e, which do not change ma|terially during that time, and are then &s;uc|ceeded by general coldne&s;s, cold &s;weat, a greater or le&s;s degree of coma and deli|rium, or a &s;tate very much re&s;embling in|toxication. Life in this &s;tate is lengthened out to &s;ixty or ninety hours from the fir&s;t attack. A &s;hort interval of rea&s;on then takes place; the patient con&s;iders him&s;elf better, and is for a moment flattered with the pro&s;pect of recovery; but a fit as &s;ud|den and unexpected as the fir&s;t comes on, during which he foams at the mouth, rolls his eyes dreadfully, and throws out and pulls back his extremities in violent and quick alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In general the
<PB N="107" REF="035302_0122_100218C709C386E8">
patient expires in this fit; but &s;ome have recovered from it, and continued rational for a few hours longer, when a &s;econd fit has carried them off. This has been the general progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e in its wor&s;t form; and indeed there have not been many deviations from it; the principal of the&s;e were, the general &s;ymptoms coming on without any preceding convul&s;ion. The patient has been, in &s;ome in&s;tances, coma|to&s;e from the very commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e; others have had the di&s;ea&s;e u&s;hered in by a frequent &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;hort con|vul&s;ive fits, and it has afterwards been marked with con&s;tant delirium and cold clammy &s;weat, without any intervening heat of &s;urface, &amp;c. The di&s;ea&s;e too, in a few ca&s;es, has &s;eized the patient in the manner mo&s;t other fevers come on; that is, with &s;hivering and a &s;en&s;e of cold. The mo&s;t con&s;tant &s;ymptoms, and con&s;equently tho&s;e which di&s;tingui&s;hed the di&s;ea&s;e, were the uncommon &s;uddenne&s;s of its attack; the remarkably acute pain in the loins and calves of the legs: the watery, inflamed, and rolling eye; the flu&s;hing of the face; the tendency to coma from the very on&s;et;
<PB N="108" REF="035302_0123_100218CAADF27B50">
the peculiarity of the delirium attending; and the pain confined to the forehead &s;el|dom extending to the temples, or even to the &s;inciput. However mild ca&s;es might be in other re&s;pects, the&s;e were always pre|&s;ent. In no di&s;ea&s;e I have ever met with, is the phy&s;ician more liable to be deceived; for often when every &s;ymptom, indicating danger, has been apparently removed; when the &s;kin has become cool, the pul&s;e &s;eemingly natural, and the &s;tomach &s;o re|tentive as to receive a large quantity of bark, convul&s;ions &s;uddenly &s;eize the pa|tient and &s;oon deprive him of life; or de|lirium and cold clammy &s;weats &s;uper&s;ede the favourable appearances, and forerun di&s;|&s;olution. How applicable therefore is M.

<P><PB N="109" REF="035302_0124_100218CC46DFB460">
The delirium attending this fever is of a peculiar ca&s;t. During it, the countenance, the eyes, and the actions of the patient re&s;emble very much tho&s;e of a per&s;on in|ebriated. It is almo&s;t always mild, and ne|ver furious; but is accompanied con&s;tantly with re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and efforts to get out of bed. In a few in&s;tances the&s;e ro&s;e &s;o high, as to render the attempts of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants of no avail; the patients dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, went out, and walked a con&s;iderable way before they could be overpowered. The mind &s;eems agitated by the objects which were mo&s;t its pur&s;uit during health. An engineer, in his delirium, is continually em|ployed in giving directions to the inferior officers, advi&s;ing with them, and &s;uper|intending the labour of the workmen. A man much involved in debt, is ince&s;&s;antly arranging with his creditors. A &s;oldier talks of the duty he is employed in, and ever and anon expre&s;&s;es his fear of the offi|cer's di&s;plea&s;ure. A &s;ailor, in the &s;ame man|ner, is &s;olely engaged in maritime affairs. Scenes of former plea&s;ure are eagerly re|called, and pre&s;ented to the imagination in their mo&s;t alluring circum&s;tances; and if a
<PB N="110" REF="035302_0125_100218CE725EBAC8">
momentary interval of rea&s;on takes place, the mo&s;t piercing lamentations are the con|&s;equence. But in all ca&s;es of delirium, whatever the &s;ubject may be which the pa|tient raves about, he is evidently and &s;trongly actuated by fear; and a word from the phy&s;ician immediately reduces him to the mo&s;t implicit obedience, however re&s;t|le&s;s he might have been before. No pain is complained of during this &s;tate; the ir|ritation of bli&s;ters has no effect in rou&s;ing the patient; and the operation of medi|cines that prove laxative, though not ad|mini&s;tered with that intention, pa&s;&s;es with|out ob&s;ervation, and without &s;en&s;ibility. The patient, on being que&s;tioned re&s;pecting his &s;ituation, &s;eems to recognize the per&s;on who &s;peaks; but never complains of any thing; his an&s;wer being con&s;tantly that he is very well. Indeed, during the low &s;tate of the fever, whether delirium is pre&s;ent or not, the &s;en&s;ations of the patient &s;eem ex|ceedingly imperfect; and in&s;tead of refer|ing to any &s;ymptom which the by&s;tanders perceive evidently, his an&s;wer invariably is, that he is very well; and &s;en&s;ible of no pain. During delirium, the patient's lips are in con|tinual

motion; he is continually muttering, and he is continually attempting to reach to &s;ome object which his deranged imagi|nation pre&s;ents to him. The &s;trength, during the delirious &s;tate, appears to be &s;urpri&s;ingly great, for it is frequently nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e the united efforts of two or three men to keep the patient in bed. This is however no more than a &s;pa&s;modic affection of the mu&s;cles, for in reality the powers of the &s;ick in this di&s;ea&s;e are reduced to the extreme of debility, as is &s;een in the convale&s;cent &s;tate. The delirium comes on generally at the commencement of the low &s;tate, but is frequently pre&s;ent during the whole of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Coma is the next mo&s;t remarkable &s;ymp|tom in this fever. After the fir&s;t two days there is always more or le&s;s tendency to it; but after the third day, if the patient &s;ur|vives it, it has been in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, pre&s;ent. He appears drow&s;y, and is in|&s;en&s;ible of pain, or irritation of any kind; he moans and &s;ighs much, but is immove|ble, unle&s;s called on. He generally lies on his back, with his eyes half open, the

balls of which do not appear to be capable of motion: if there is any it is extremely languid; their lu&s;tre is al&s;o much dimi|ni&s;hed. For &s;ome time I could not account for the &s;upervention of this &s;tate at a cer|tain &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e: anxious to di&s;cover whether it depended on any peculiar af|fection of the &s;en&s;oriu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, I examined the brain of two men who died on the fifth day. The&s;e patients, after the &s;ymptoms &s;trictly febrile had abated, became coma|to&s;e; in which &s;tate they continued till a convul&s;ion put a period to their exi&s;tence on the fifth day. In the fir&s;t I examined the upper part of the cranium, on being &s;awed and prized up by a chi&s;&s;el, was &s;o pre&s;&s;ed from inwards by the &s;welling of the cerebrum as to fly off, or &s;eparate in &s;uch a manner as if a &s;pring from within acted on it. On cutting into the cerebrum, the quantity of &s;erous fluid was &s;urpri&s;|ingly great; but as the greate&s;t part was lo&s;t, it was impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain it. In the brain of the &s;econd, the quantity of water was al&s;o con&s;iderable. After ob&s;erv|ing the&s;e appearances, I was led to exa|mine more attentively the &s;tate of the eyes

of my patients in this di&s;ea&s;e; and I have not the &s;malle&s;t he&s;itation in declaring, that in all tho&s;e who became comato&s;e, there was a very con&s;iderable and permanent di|latation of the pupils: an appearance which left no room to doubt re&s;pecting the &s;tate of the brain, and the nature of the &s;ymptom it gave ri&s;e to. I believe this appearance has not been noticed by writers on this &s;ub|ject. Of tho&s;e at pre&s;ent in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, M.

<P>Dr. Ru&s;h informs us, that a dilatation of the pupils was a very general &s;ymptom of the malignant pe&s;ti|lential fever, as it appeared in Philadelphia.&mdash;"For a while I a&s;cribed this peculiarity in the pul&s;e (a &s;mall intermitting, &s;low, and ten&s;e, or chorded pul&s;e) more e&s;pecially its <HI>&s;lowne&s;s,</HI> to an affection of the brain only, and &s;u&s;pected that it was produced by what I have taken the liberty el&s;ewhere to call the <HI>phrenicula,</HI> or inflamma|tory &s;tate of the internal drop&s;y of the brain; and which I have remarked to be an occa&s;ional &s;ymptom and con|&s;equence of remitting fever. I was the more di&s;po&s;ed to adopt this opinion, from perceiving this &s;low and inter|mitting pul&s;e more frequently in children than in adults. Impre&s;&s;ed with this idea, I reque&s;ted Mr. Coxe, one of my pupils, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in examining the &s;tate of the eye.

The appearance which marked the cha|racter of the fever mo&s;t unequivocally, was a &s;pecies of efflore&s;cence, which is &s;aid to be peculiar to malignant and pe&s;tilential fevers: this efflore&s;cence re&s;embled more patches of red or livid &s;pots, than what is generally under&s;tood by the word Petechiae; and appeared &s;ometimes at the commence|ment of the &s;low or comato&s;e &s;tate; but oftener a few hours before death. It was a very fatal &s;ymptom; for I do not recollect a &s;ingle in&s;tance of recovery when it took place.

ca&s;es, almo&s;t the whole body has be|come of a deep livid or black colour three hours before death. In one in&s;tance, a young woman ju&s;t arrived from England, petechiae evidently appeared on her neck, brea&s;t, and arms; and it was the only one in which I perceived any thing of the kind; they con&s;tituted as fatal a &s;ign as the vibices, for the patient died &s;oon after their eruption, on the third day of the fever.

<P>The pains complained of in this fever, particularly tho&s;e of the head and legs, are in many re&s;pects peculiar to it. The for|mer is confined to the forehead, and &s;hoots inwardly towards the bottom of the orbits,

where it is generally exqui&s;ite; it al&s;o &s;ome|times extends to the temples, where indeed there is always a throbbing. In no ca&s;e has pain been felt in the occiput, or ge|nerally throughout the head. The albu|ginea of the eyes is always much inflamed at the &s;ame time; the balls are generally protruded, or &s;eem ready to &s;tart from their orbits; and the patient is &s;en&s;ible of a pain in them, which renders the admi&s;&s;ion of light intolerable. It has &s;ometimes hap|pened that the right eye has been mo&s;t con|&s;iderably affected; and when this has been the ca&s;e, the pain has been mo&s;t felt in the right &s;ide of the head. The pain in the legs has been always felt immediately below the calf, where the ga&s;trocnemii and &s;oleus mu&s;cles unite and form the great tendon. A con&s;iderable involuntary contraction of the leg takes place in con&s;equence of it; and in the point where it is chiefly felt, it communicates a &s;en&s;ation &s;imilar to gnaw|ing, which from time to time occa&s;ions ex|treme torture. Upon the whole, this pain re&s;embles very much the cramp; with this difference only, that it is, during the con|tinuance of the fever, more permanent.</P>

I have already ob&s;erved, that at the com|mencement of this fever the pul&s;e is quick, hard, and &s;mall; and it is always &s;o in the more violent ca&s;es. It is often, however, very full at this period; and when it is &s;o, it affords a favourable progno&s;tic. But in no di&s;ea&s;e is the &s;tate of the pul&s;e more &s;ubject to variation than in this before us. It has frequently happened, and more e&s;|pecially with the robu&s;t, that during the &s;tage immediately &s;ucceeding the febrile one, flu&s;hing and chilline&s;s have oftentimes alternated in le&s;s than a minute; and that although the &s;kin felt con&s;iderably warm, the pul&s;e has been no more than 52; but that, even when the low &s;tate came on, in which there is always a di&s;agreeable cold|ne&s;s of the &s;urface, it has been as quick and nearly as full as during the preceding febrile &s;tage, although unaccompanied with thir&s;t, or any other evident &s;ymptom of the exi&s;tence of fever. One remarkable cir|cum&s;tance of the pul&s;e in this di&s;ea&s;e is, that it never intermits; even at the ap|proach of death it has not intermitted; but has been generally remarkably tremulous, and &s;o &s;low, as to beat no more than thirty

times in a minute. Upon the whole, I have never found it quicker than 130, nor &s;lower than 30, in a minute.</P>
<P>Sub&s;ultus tendinum is by no means a common &s;ymptom in the advanced &s;tage; but tremor of the hands and of the lips, and violent &s;pa&s;modic contraction of the legs and arms are very common, and al|ways progno&s;ticate much danger.</P>
<P>The appearance of the tongue is very various; in &s;ome patients continuing white with florid edges to the very la&s;t; in others, becoming dark-coloured very early, and changing to black a little before death; but in general, the change of colour of the fur with which the tongue, teeth, and even the fauces are covered, is gradual. Thus, during the two fir&s;t days it is a white or clayey; it afterwards becomes buffy; then of a deep orange; about the fifth day, browni&s;h; and when the ca&s;e terminates in death, black. The thickne&s;s of the fur increa&s;es with the di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;eems latterly to impede much the &s;peech of the patient. The edges of the tongue are generally florid, exactly

re&s;embling its appearance in chronic aphthae. I have not unfrequently &s;een the tongue have the appearance of having been ex|po&s;ed to foot, and covered with it: a &s;in|gular circum&s;tance, and mentioned by no writer I am acquainted with, except M.

There were two kinds of eruption about the lips, of a very oppo&s;ite nature; one &s;uch as frequently appears at the termi|nation of common remittents, and indicat|ing a favourable change; the other, con|&s;i&s;ting of black &s;pots or &s;pecks, &s;uch as might be made by the point of a painter's fine pencil, all round the mouth, but e&s;pe|cially the upper lip, and near the edge of the prolabium; and indicating with cer|tainty a fatal termination.

<P>Haemorrhage has occurred in this di&s;ea&s;e much oftener and more profu&s;ely, and has been attended with more dangerous con|&s;equences than in any other, the &s;curvy perhaps excepted, that I have met with. In &s;everal in&s;tances, the immen&s;ity of blood di&s;charged has evidently been the more immediate cau&s;e of death. The robu&s;t, ple|thoric, and gro&s;s habits have been the mo&s;t &s;ubject to it. It has taken place from the no&s;trils, mouth, anus, and urethra; &s;ome|times from the canthi of the eyes; but
<PB N="121" REF="035302_0136_100218E64851DA30">
never, I believe, from the ears or pores of the &s;kin. The mo&s;t profu&s;e di&s;charge has been from the no&s;trils and anus, and has frequently amounted to three or four pounds at a time; the &s;tools having been on the&s;e occa&s;ions entirely compo&s;ed of pure blood. Towards the clo&s;e of life, the blood thus di&s;charged has appeared granulous, or like ichor, with a &s;ediment of a black gritty &s;ub|&s;tance; and has been &s;o extremely offen&s;ive as to oblige all the attendants to keep at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance till the haemorrhage cea&s;ed. Haemorrhage, however, has never been critical, nor has it in any in&s;tance per|manently relieved the headach or pain in the brea&s;t or &s;ide. I have &s;ometimes been induced to think, that it had benefited the patient, by his declaring that the headach had abated in con&s;equence of it; but cold clammy &s;weats, an almo&s;t imperceptible pul&s;e, and delirium or coma &s;upervening &s;oon after, evinced the imperfect &s;tate of the patient's feelings, and the fallacy of the progno&s;tic.</P>
<P>Nearly about the period the&s;e profu&s;e di&s;|charges of blood came on, a rawne&s;s was
<PB N="122" REF="035302_0137_100218E8B6F83460">
felt on the whole of the interior &s;urface of the no&s;e; and on &s;everal parts of it, little ulcers formed; on others, &s;mall e&s;cars, which were remarkably itchy; but on being touched, or an attempt made by the patient to detach them from the membrane of the no&s;e, were very painful, and bled. The&s;e di&s;appeared in proportion to the patient's recovery; and I had much rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that when the i&s;&s;ue of the di&s;ea&s;e was fatal, the&s;e little e&s;cars became gangrenous.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time another &s;ymptom appeared in many in&s;tances; which, were it not for its &s;ingularity, might be con&s;idered as too minute to be mentioned among tho&s;e which di&s;tingui&s;hed the di&s;ea&s;e. Its &s;ingu|larity ari&s;es chiefly from the &s;ilence of mo|dern writers on the malignant ho&s;pital or jail fever, with re&s;pect to it; and from its appearing to be critical in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance.<NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Dr. Donald Monro mentions the occurrence of a &s;welling and &s;ub&s;equent &s;uppuration of the te&s;ticles in the malignant fever. <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es of the Army,</HI> 1&s;t.

I. p. 291. I think &s;omething of this kind is mentioned by Thucydides, in his cele|brated account of the Plague of Athens; but as I have not the original, I cannot &s;peak with certainty. In Dr. Clifton's tran&s;lation of this part of Thucydides's hi&s;tory, there is the following pa&s;&s;age: "For the di&s;|ea&s;e went through the whole body, beginning fir&s;t in the head; and, if any e&s;caped, where the ca&s;e was very de&s;perate, this was denoted by the extremities being af|fected; for it broke out <HI>upon the private parts,</HI> the fingers, and toes,' &amp;c. <HI>Clifton's Tran&s;lation of Hyppocrates upon Air, Water, and Situation,</HI> &amp;c. Ed. 1739, p. 97. Hippocrates in &s;everal places mentions an affection of the &s;crotum and te&s;ticles in malignant and pe&s;tilential fevers. Does this afford a collateral proof of the pe&s;tilential nature of the di&s;ea&s;e before us? A remarkable ca&s;e of this kind occurred in the month of May, 1794. Mr. O'Hara, an officer of his Maje&s;ty's 56th regiment, un|commonly robu&s;t, and aged about twenty, having been &s;eized with all the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms in the more violent degree of the Boullam Fever, as it was then di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, had on the 4th day a very large di&s;charge of purulent matter from the urethra, attended with very con&s;iderable &s;welling of the &s;crotum. The di&s;charge continued to increa&s;e all the 5th; and I began to form a favourable progno&s;tic from it. On the 6th, however, it became ichorous; the penis &s;welled to a mon&s;trous &s;ize, as did the &s;crotum; and both began to change to a black colour. The&s;e unfavourable appearances in|crea&s;ed rapidly the 7th and 8th, and the di&s;charge be|came then a putrid &s;anies, exce&s;&s;ively offen&s;ive. On the day of his death, the 9th, the &s;crotum was fully nine inches in diameter, and the penis three; and both were completely mortified and black. During the latter days of his illne&s;s, he lo&s;t a prodigious quantity of blood from the no&s;e, mouth, ears, eyes, and even from the pores of his &s;kin.</NOTE> About the end of the &s;econd day,

the patient begins to complain of a violent pain in his te&s;ticles; on que&s;tioning him, he
<PB N="124" REF="035302_0139_100218ED4B91EDE8">
&s;ays he feels a contraction of the &s;per|matic chord, and is &s;en&s;ible of a drawing up of the te&s;ticles towards the abdominal ring. On examination they appear very much le&s;&s;ened in &s;ize, are drawn up con&s;i|derably towards the abdomen; and the &s;crotum appears at the &s;ame time remark|ably flaccid and empty. The &s;urface of the &s;crotum becomes &s;oon after very pain|ful, and an excoriation takes place, chiefly at the mo&s;t de&s;cending part, from which a con&s;iderable quantity of very offen&s;ive pu|rulent matter i&s;&s;ues: at the &s;ame time a &s;imilar di&s;charge from the urethra takes place; which cea&s;es with the di&s;ea&s;e when the event is favourable, or becomes icho|rous or bloody, and in&s;ufferably foetid when death is the con&s;equence. In ca&s;es which
<PB N="125" REF="035302_0140_100218EEDE957BA8">
terminate favourably, the whole of the &s;cro|tum in a few days is covered with a coat of hardened pus, which, in the convale&s;cent &s;tate, comes away very ea&s;ily by means of a warm bath. The thickne&s;s of this coat way be about a fourth of a line, and when &s;eparated, re&s;embles much moi&s;tened parch|ment. In fatal ca&s;es, this affection of the &s;crotum always terminates in gangrene a few hours before death.</P>
<P>The change of voice is very remarkable in this fever; for from a &s;trong tenor or manly &s;ound, it &s;inks to a treble, or a &s;ound much &s;ofter, lower, and &s;hriller than the natural one; the &s;yllables are more di&s;tingui&s;hed, and the words are &s;trangely lengthened out in a draw|ling or whining manner. In the patients who have &s;unk under this di&s;ea&s;e, the change of voice happens much earlier, and more re|markably than in others. It has therefore always afforded me a pretty certain prog|no&s;tic of the event; for any alteration of the &s;ound towards the natural one, is an al|mo&s;t certain &s;ign of a favourable change.</P>
<P>A &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine is by no means an uncommon &s;ymptom in the bilious remit|tents
<PB N="126" REF="035302_0141_100218F0728238B8">
of the country; and, in general, it is a circum&s;tance which often occurs in fevers of a &s;ynochus or typhus character; but in the malignant pe&s;tilential fever, it is par|ticularly remarkable for its coming on early, its duration, and the cau&s;e which &s;eems to produce it. In the third volume of the Edinburgh Literary E&s;&s;ays, there is a very ingenious and u&s;eful paper on the affection of the urinary bladder, which Dr. Gilchri&s;t, the author, has called a "thickening of the bladder." To this I might refer for a de&s;cription of the &s;tate of the bladder occa|&s;ioning urinary &s;uppre&s;&s;ion in this fever; for on di&s;&s;ection it appears exactly &s;imilar. Here I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion is accompanied by a violent pain above the os pubis; a &s;calding in the urethra; a &s;en&s;e of fullne&s;s, without any vi&s;ible tur|ge&s;cence in the region of the pubes; a con|&s;iderable contraction and contortion of the penis; and the urine is generally of a very deep red colour; &s;ometimes browni&s;h; &s;ome|times green; very frequently bloody; and, in a few in&s;tances, much inclining to black, and of an oily con&s;i&s;tence. The &s;mell of the urine was generally offen&s;ive in the highe&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="035302_0142_100218F3A0487338">
degree. Indeed, all the excretions were re|markably foetid; but the &s;tools were more e&s;pecially &s;o. Con&s;tipation almo&s;t univer|&s;ally prevailed: a circum&s;tance extremely unfavourable, as the means u&s;ed to obviate it always increa&s;ed the tendency to putre|faction, by bringing on debility propor|tioned to their effect. This appeared to ari&s;e from a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of tone in the in|te&s;tinal canal; for on exciting the fibres to act, a redundant evacuation was gene|rally the con&s;equence. The faeces at the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e were &s;eldom very foetid; but, during its progre&s;s, be|came exce&s;&s;ively &s;o; and, a little before death, when they were di&s;charged in&s;en|&s;ibly, the &s;mell was intolerable. The co|lour and con&s;i&s;tence of this di&s;charge varied much; from yellow, or a yellowi&s;h white to black; and from a con&s;iderable degree of thickne&s;s, to the exact appearance of coffee-grounds. The di&s;charge by vomiting, which became a mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptom at the commencement of the low &s;tate, al&s;o varied much; although for the mo&s;t part pora|cious; but towards the fatal cri&s;is, always black, and re&s;embling coffee badly boiled.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="035302_0143_100218F534EF7BB0">
The thir&s;t was not very con&s;iderable in general, and no very u&s;eful indication could be drawn from the &s;tate of it. It was, however, a bad &s;ign when the thir&s;t cea&s;ed, e&s;pecially if at the &s;ame time the tongue appeared parched, cracked, and black.</P>
<P>A principal di&s;tinction between this di&s;|ea&s;e and typhus icteroides, is the yellow &s;uf|fu&s;ion, which in the former very &s;eldom hap|pened; in the latter almo&s;t always. But as this appearance can never be con&s;idered as a di&s;|tingui&s;hing &s;ymptom in any highly malig|nant fever, it frequently occurring where the other &s;ymptoms point out a di&s;ea&s;e differing e&s;&s;entially from that in which it mo&s;t gene|rally takes place, it will be &s;ufficient to mention, that in &s;ome protracted ca&s;es on &s;hore, and in &s;ome among the &s;ailors which might have been a combination of the pe&s;tilential and yellow fevers, this &s;ymptom appeared about the 5th, 7th, or 9th day.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t other di&s;ea&s;es degenerated into, or partook very much of the nature of this. Dy&s;enteries &s;uddenly &s;topped, and were im|mediately &s;ucceeded by the &s;ymptoms of the
<PB N="129" REF="035302_0144_100218F779C66BA8">
pe&s;tilential fever. A remarkable in&s;tance of this occurred in the month of July, 1793. About the beginning of the month, twenty-&s;even recruits joined the detachment of royal artillery in this i&s;land. The&s;e men formed part of the artillery, which, with other troops under the command of Major Ge|neral Bruce, landed on the i&s;land of Marti|nique about the middle of June. During the three days they remained on &s;hore, they were encamped, and almo&s;t the whole time expo&s;ed to very heavy rain. Dy&s;enteries were the con&s;equence; and mo&s;t of them, on their arrival here, were immediately ad|mitted into the royal artillery ho&s;pital; where at that time, as has been already ob&s;erved, there were many ca&s;es of the pe&s;tilential fever. The apparent effect of the medicines they took very much &s;urpri&s;|ed me; but I &s;oon found that the original di&s;ea&s;e only yielded to one more powerful; for in a few hours after the &s;ymptoms of dy&s;entery di&s;appeared, tho&s;e of the pe&s;ti|lential fever came on. Catarrhal com|plaints, &s;imple at fir&s;t, &s;oon changed their nature: convale&s;cents from other di&s;ea&s;es were very &s;ubject to this, but it generally
<PB N="130" REF="035302_0145_100218F91A4109F0">
proved mild. Tho&s;e labouring at the time under chronic complaints, particularly rheu|mati&s;m and hepatitis, were al&s;o very &s;ubject to it. The puerperal fever became malig|nant, and of cour&s;e fatal; and even among pregnant negro-women, who otherwi&s;e might have had it in the u&s;ual mild degree peculiar to that de&s;cription of people, were reduced to a very dangerous &s;ituation by it. In &s;hort, every di&s;ea&s;e, in which the patient was liable to infection, &s;ooner or later a&s;&s;um|ed the appearance, and acquired the danger of the pe&s;tilential fever.</P>
<P>Although the contagion &s;eemed to vary much in different de&s;criptions of people, it is highly probable that the virus of the contagion it&s;elf was uniformly the &s;ame, only variou&s;ly modified by peculiar con&s;ti|tutions, habits, or modes of living. Thus among &s;ailors, perhaps a &s;corbutic taint, joined to extreme irregularity and impru|dence, rendered the di&s;ea&s;e infinitely more fatal than among any other cla&s;s of men. On the other hand, among field-negroes who certainly po&s;&s;e&s;s an idio&s;yncra&s;y peculiar to them&s;elves, and who&s;e mode of living is
<PB N="131" REF="035302_0146_100218FBD40F8368">
generally temperate and regular in a re|markable degree, the virus of the conta|gion was &s;o blunted, as to act in the milde&s;t form. Why, however, it &s;hould operate with mo&s;t violence on Europeans ju&s;t arriv|ed, and who had never entered the torrid zone before, is a &s;ingularity I do not pre|tend to explain. The advice of Cel&s;us is very applicable in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, and may afford us a hint with re&s;pect to the cau&s;e of this &s;ingularity: "Si plenior ali|quis, et &s;pecio&s;ior, et coloratior factus e&s;t, &s;u&s;pecta habere &s;ua bona debet."<NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Lib. II. cap. 2.</NOTE> Every thing debilitating predi&s;po&s;ed the body to be acted on by this contagion; fear; an hypochondriacal di&s;po&s;ition; inebriation; fa&s;ting, or vi&s;iting the &s;ick with an empty &s;tomach; great fatigue; entering the cham|ber of the &s;ick in full per&s;piration, &amp;c. But whatever were the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es, the contagion always acted within four days from its application to the body. I am aware of the difficulty of a&s;certaining the time which contagion takes to act on the &s;y&s;tem after its admi&s;&s;ion into it; but my
<PB N="132" REF="035302_0147_100218FE447576D8">
&s;ituation afforded me many opportunities of knowing it with &s;ufficient exactne&s;s. In &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;ymptoms of its action have ap|peared in &s;ix hours; in others, in twenty hours; in others in forty-eight; and in others, not till the expiration of the fourth day; &s;o that, in general, we may con&s;ider the &s;pace of time required for the production of di&s;ea&s;e con&s;equent upon the application of the contagion, as about a trifle &s;hort of two days. For although all from whom I have received the information which has enabled me to make the above calculation, have been &s;en&s;ible of receiving the contagion, the in|&s;tant it was applied, by nau&s;ea and &s;light rigor indicating it, yet tho&s;e &s;ymptoms were only momentary.

Dr. Guthrie of St. Peter&s;burgh, from the information he re|ceived from the medical gentlemen of the Ru&s;&s;ian army, as well as from the event of the inoculation for the plague in one in|&s;tance, &s;eems inclined to fix the time of action of pe&s;tilential contagion, at the fourth

The importance of a&s;certaining this point with tolerable preci&s;ion, is evident; preven|tion altogether depending on it.</P>
<P>Another point &s;ubject to much uncer|tainty, and a good deal agitated among phy|&s;icians, is the di&s;tance at which it is po&s;|&s;ible to communicate the contagion. The re&s;ult of my inquiries and ob&s;ervation on this &s;ubject amounts to the following facts: 1. That tho&s;e who mo&s;t carefully avoid hou&s;es where the infection is, are the mo&s;t certain to e&s;cape it. 2. That although the di&s;ea&s;e is in the &s;ame hou&s;e, avoiding the chamber of the &s;ick, prevents infection. 3. That the merely entering the chamber of the &s;ick, without nearly approaching the di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on, has never communicated infection. 4. That approaching &s;o near the di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on as to be &s;en&s;ible of the foetor of his breath; or of the peculiar &s;mell
<PB N="134" REF="035302_0149_100219027B76DEB0">
which is always emitted from the bodies of the &s;ick in this di&s;ea&s;e; or to touch the bed-clothes he lies on, generally occa&s;ions nau&s;ea, &s;light rigors, and often headach at the moment, and &s;ome hours after the di&s;|ea&s;e it&s;elf. 5. That actual contact, &s;o that the per&s;pired fluid of the &s;ick per&s;on may adhere to the hands, &amp;c. of the healthy per&s;on, more certainly produces this di&s;ea&s;e. 6. That touching the wearing apparel of a per&s;on who is actually di&s;ea&s;ed, or has ju&s;t recovered from the di&s;ea&s;e, as certainly com|municates the infection to the healthy per|&s;on. And, 7. That frequently the merely pa&s;&s;ing a per&s;on infected, or who wears the clothes he had on during the exi&s;tence of the di&s;ea&s;e, in &s;uch a manner as that the effluvia proceeding from them may be blown on the healthy per&s;on, has produced the di&s;|ea&s;e. From hence it is evident, that the infectious effluvia do not extend them&s;elves beyond a limited di&s;tance from the per&s;on or thing from which they are emitted; and this di&s;tance may be fixed at the utmo&s;t at &s;ix or ten feet. Dr. Lind, however, thinks that "in the open free air, this infection does not appear to diffu&s;e it&s;elf above fifty

&s;ixty feet from its nidus; though even at that di&s;tance a per&s;on might run &s;ome ri&s;que from being expo&s;ed to a current of air highly impregnated with the contagion which immediately i&s;&s;ued from a door or window, where it had been long pent up.<NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">Dr. James Lind's E&s;&s;ays, Ed. 1774, p. 319.</NOTE> Although this, during the time the malignant pe&s;tilential fever prevailed here, never, I believe, happened, both accounts may be reconciled, by allowing for the influence of heat in this climate, occa&s;ioning &s;uch a degree of rarefaction of the air as to prevent the diffu&s;ion of contagion beyond the at|mo&s;phere immediately &s;urrounding the di&s;|ea&s;ed or infected body, the radius of which may be e&s;timated at &s;ix or ten feet. And Dr. Blane very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that "viru|lent matter is of &s;uch a degree of volatility as to be readily di&s;&s;ipated in a certain de|gree of heat."<NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Di&s;ea&s;es of Seamen, p. 279.</NOTE> But whatever the limits of infection may be with re&s;pect to its power of acting on healthy bodies, much mu&s;t de|pend on the &s;tate of the&s;e bodies at the time they are expo&s;ed to the contagion.</P>

The danger attending the opening of bodies in this di&s;ea&s;e, prevented me from extending my inquiries this way &s;o far as I otherwi&s;e would have done. I opened only five, the appearances in which I &s;hall here give an account of. Three of the five were &s;ailors, who died on the fifth day, and laboured under the wor&s;t &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e. In one of them it began and ter|minated with convul&s;ive paroxy&s;ms. The inte&s;tines were much inflated, inflamed, and &s;phacelated, particularly the duodenum, a lit|tle beyond the pylorus; the liver had &s;hrunk to le&s;s than one-half its natural &s;ize, was uncommonly flaccid, and of a colour nearly approaching to buff; or a mixture of yellow and that of a&s;hes; the gall-bladder was flaccid and greyi&s;h, and contained a &s;mall quantity of very dark-coloured, ropey bile. The &s;pleen and pancreas were in a natural &s;tate; but the lungs were highly inflamed, and of a livery texture and hue: a circum|&s;tance the more extraordinary, as no &s;ymp|tom of marked pulmonary affection could be perceived during the exi&s;tence of the di&s;ea&s;e. The bladder contained near three quarts of urine; and was dilated to con&s;i|derably
<PB N="137" REF="035302_0152_1002190980C47CC8">
above the os pubis; and its coats were much thickened. This patient had been con&s;tantly tormented with pain, through|out the whole region of the pelvis, and al|mo&s;t a total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine.</P>
<P>The &s;econd was remarkably robu&s;t and athletic, and had been &s;eized with the di&s;|ea&s;e in the form of an agui&s;h paroxy&s;m; but died &s;trongly convul&s;ed. The vi&s;cera were in general in the &s;ame &s;tate, particularly the liver. All the ve&s;&s;els of the inte&s;tines were uncommonly turgid; the right kidney was mortified; although, during his illne&s;s, no &s;ymptom of inflammation of that organ was perceived. The quantity of urine was &s;mall, although the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion had been con&s;iderable; and the bladder, a good deal enlarged, felt much like an ela&s;tic gum-&s;yringe; the coats very much thickened, but renitent.</P>
<P>The principal morbid appearances in the bodies of the third and fourth, I have al|ready de&s;cribed. The&s;e two were the only &s;ubjects in which I examined the &s;tate of the brain. To what I have already &s;aid on
<PB N="138" REF="035302_0153_1002190B1525FC78">
the di&s;&s;ection of the&s;e two bodies, I have only to add, that the vi&s;cera of the abdo|men and thorax, were exactly in the &s;ame &s;tate as the others; and that one was a young man of the royal artillery, about 18 years of age, who arrived with his ma&s;ter, Capt. Irwin of that corps, about &s;ix weeks before; was remarkably florid, robu&s;t, and lively; and ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to avail him|&s;elf of medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance during the whole of his illne&s;s. In the brain of this young man, the quantity of blood was &s;urpri&s;ingly great; for, exclu&s;ive of what was lo&s;t in opening the cranium, fully two pounds were collected. In the left ventricle the quantity of water was al&s;o con&s;iderable; but there was none in the right. The fourth ventricle contained a larger quantity than ordinary; and the plexus choroides was almo&s;t obliterated. There was no poly|pous concretion in either of the ventricles of the heart.</P>
<P>In the fifth, a young man of the royal artillery, ju&s;t arrived from England, who died in twenty-nine hours from the com|mencement of the fever, the appearance of
<PB N="139" REF="035302_0154_1002190D791C54B0">
the vi&s;cera was exactly the &s;ame. This man's fever abated con&s;iderably on the breaking out of a copious diaphore&s;is; his &s;tomach was remarkably retentive, which enabled him to take at lea&s;t two ounces of bark in a very few hours. As he was preparing to take a do&s;e of this medicine, he felt a little unea&s;ine&s;s at his &s;tomach, which induced him to defer it; but on lay|ing his head on the pillow, he expired without a groan, or the lea&s;t &s;truggle.</P>
<P>Mr. White, mate to the 45th regiment, who at that time attended the ho&s;pital of the regiment, with much and de&s;erved credit to him&s;elf, opened &s;everal bodies of &s;oldiers who died of the malignant pe&s;ti|lential fever; and he in all remarked the &s;ame appearances I have above de&s;cribed. He did not examine the brain in any in&s;tance but from the &s;ymptoms, particularly the coma, delirium, and dilatation of the pupils, being exactly &s;imilar, little doubt can re|main with re&s;pect to the &s;tate of it.</P>
<P>I may here ob&s;erve, that the appearances in the bodies of twenty which were opened
<PB N="140" REF="035302_0155_1002191071B47CC0">
at Bre&s;t, were almo&s;t exactly &s;imilar, that of the liver in particular, which M.

<P>The only material difference which ap|pears between the di&s;&s;ections de&s;cribed by Sir John Pringle, and tho&s;e which were made here is, that in his there were ab|&s;ce&s;&s;es in the brain; whereas in ours, a con|&s;iderable quantity of &s;erous fluid in one, and of &s;erous fluid and blood in another, alone were found. But this difference, I appre|hend, may be very readily accounted for by the very rapid progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e in our ca&s;es, and the length of time to which tho&s;e Sir John Pringle treated, were pro|tracted. In ours, the di&s;ea&s;e terminated fatally in five days; in his, death did not

happen till the expiration of a fortnight or a month.<NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Di&s;ea&s;es of the Army, 7th ed. p. 301. It is &s;ingular that no mention is made, by this illu&s;trious phy&s;ician, of dilatation of the pupils of the eyes. Does this &s;ymptom di&s;tingui&s;h the two di&s;ea&s;es?</NOTE></P>
<P>From the circum&s;tances of this di&s;ea&s;e related in the foregoing &s;heets, it will rea|dily appear that the mode of termination could not with certainty be foretold by any one of them alone. The particular &s;tate of any of the excretions, unle&s;s the changes which took place in the other &s;ymp|toms were at the &s;ame time attended to, could not afford any preci&s;e progno&s;tic. In a word, it was only from attention to the general &s;tate of the patient, we could form any idea of what the event might be. It is a general ob&s;ervation, that in malignant fevers the critical periods are more di&s;tinctly marked than in any other; the di&s;ea&s;e be|fore us affords an additional proof of this. I have not met with any di&s;ea&s;e in this cli|mate, in which the periods were more di&s;|tinctly a&s;certained. The di&s;appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e, or the death of the patient,
<PB N="142" REF="035302_0157_10021913A046C588">
always happened on the odd days; but the change in the &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, which preceded either event, took place on even days. Thus, if the patient was wor&s;e on the evening of the &s;econd day, he would die on the third; if wor&s;e on the fourth, he would die on the fifth; and &s;o on, as far as the fourteenth day. Beyond that period, I have not &s;een an in&s;tance of the di&s;ea&s;e ending fatally, although it has been pro|tracted, in a few in&s;tances, to the 21&s;t day. In the &s;ame manner, if the patient felt better, or if there was an evident abate|ment of the &s;ymptoms on the 2d, 4th, 6th, &amp;c. days, the re&s;olution of the di&s;ea&s;e would happen on the following days. But per|haps the &s;ubjoined Table of the &s;tate of the patients in the royal artillery ho&s;pital, who recovered, and died, will illu&s;trate this point more fully than any other mode of expla|nation. I make choice of this in preference to any other part of my practice, becau&s;e there my ob&s;ervations were nece&s;&s;arily more accurate; and becau&s;e few in private life enjoy the advantages which the &s;ick of the royal artillery do; ari&s;ing from the very liberal manner in which their ho&s;pitals are

The very uncommon malignity which marked this di&s;ea&s;e after its appearance, and during its progre&s;s here, and &s;ome of its &s;ymptoms re&s;embling tho&s;e of pe&s;tilence; the manner too in which it was introduced, and afterwards propagated among the &s;ailors, garri&s;on, and inhabitants, will induce us to con&s;ider it as in no &s;mall degree partak|ing of the nature of true plague. It is ge|nerally agreed among writers, who have them&s;elves &s;een and treated the di&s;ea&s;e in all its various forms, that the only &s;ymp|toms, which can be with propriety con&s;i|dered as characteri&s;tic of the plague, are the buboes and carbuncles which appear about the critical period, and generally forerun a re&s;olution of the di&s;ea&s;e; but it has been at the &s;ame time allowed, that the plague does &s;ometimes appear without buboes. Whether the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion may be cla&s;&s;ed among the pe&s;tilential or not, I leave to tho&s;e to determine who have more lei&s;ure and fitter opportunities than I have. I &s;hall only further ob&s;erve on this head, that I have not &s;een carbuncles in any ca&s;e which ended in death; but that in many who recovered they were nume|rous,
<PB N="146" REF="035302_0161_1002191D574759C0">
large, and very trouble&s;ome. The&s;e occurred chiefly in the young and robu&s;t; and always about the period the dangerous &s;ymptoms di&s;appeared; and indeed &s;o ex|actly did the appearance of the carbuncles fall in with the favourable change in the di&s;ea&s;e, that I have always con&s;idered them as a critical di&s;charge: the only thing of the kind, except the purulent di&s;charge from the &s;crotum and urethra, I have been able to ob&s;erve in this fever. Swellings on the parotids, and buboes in the groins and arm|pits al&s;o occurred in &s;everal ca&s;es; but the&s;e generally terminated in death.</P>
<P>When this di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared here, and for &s;ome time after, the prevalent opi|nion was, that it was the yellow-fever of the We&s;t-Indies, engrafted on the European jail-fever. But it mu&s;t appear from the foregoing account, that though it is evi|dently of the nature of jail-fever, height|ened by &s;ome pe&s;tilential &s;ymptoms, it does not partake in the lea&s;t of the typhus ic|teroides. The mo&s;t obvious circum&s;tances which di&s;tingui&s;h the two di&s;ea&s;es are the following: The nature of the delirium in
<PB N="147" REF="035302_0162_1002191EF0787668">
the malignant pe&s;tilential fever is &s;ingular, and re&s;embles that in the plague, being marked with the fatuity, &s;illine&s;s, and the &s;tammering and faultering of the voice pe|culiar to that malady; the delirium in yel|low-fever is generally more of the wild, furious kind, and is never attended with the circum&s;tances mentioned. The yellow-fever is endemic and &s;poradic; the other, epidemic, and imported from another coun|try. The yellow-fever is always influenced by the weather; and, indeed, depends al|together on the heat of climate; the other, till of late, was thought to be peculiar to the temperate and cold climates. The one is evidently cau&s;ed by mar&s;h effluvia, heat, violent exerci&s;e in that heat; thick, hot, moi&s;t atmo&s;phere; night air, and dews; and the abu&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors. The other, on the contrary, is cau&s;ed by contagion alone. This is certainly the mo&s;t remark|able difference; and con&s;titutes an obvious, clear, and undi&s;putable diagno&s;is. I have never in any in&s;tance, and I have &s;een many, of yellow-fever, known it to be contagious: it has always been evidently produced by the cau&s;es mentioned; and other per&s;ons on
<PB N="148" REF="035302_0163_100219221A15A878">
board the &s;aid &s;hip, or in the &s;ame hou&s;e, have continued in perfect health. But what more po&s;itively demon&s;trates the difference between the two di&s;ea&s;es is, that the yellow-fever has been known in the We&s;t Indies ever &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the co|lonies; the malignant pe&s;tilential fever ne|ver, I believe, till the year 1793. When the yellow-fever appeared at Barbadoes in 1721, Dr. Warren, who then practi&s;ed there, was induced from its violence, and the &s;eeming likene&s;s of many of the &s;ymp|toms, to call it a &s;pecies of the plague im|ported from Mar&s;eilles to Martinique, and from thence to Barbadoes. That it was not pe&s;tilential, however, is manife&s;t from the united te&s;timony of contemporary practi|tioners, and from the account given by Mr. Hughes, the Natural Hi&s;torian of the colony at that period.<NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. Griffith Hughes's <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory of Barbadoes,</HI> folio ed. p. 37, 38. Dr. William Hil|lary, 2d ed. <HI>On the Air and Di&s;ea&s;es in Barbadoes,</HI> p. 144, 145. M. Poupp&eacute; De&s;portes, in his de&s;cription of the yellow-fever, corre&s;ponds exactly with the idea he gives of it in his Con&s;titutions of the different Years: "On a ignor&eacute; pendant long-temps les fune&s;tes effets de cette maladie dans les i&s;les; la regularit&eacute; avec laquelle elle &s;e reproduit, &s;emble devoir la faire regarder comme une de ces maladies dont il faut chercher la cau&s;e dans la con&s;titution de l'air." <HI>Hi&s;toire des Maladies de S.

The attentive peru&s;al of this writer's Con&s;titutions of the Air at Cape Francois from 1732 to 1748, when he died, will give a much better idea of the cau&s;es and nature of the yellow-fever, or "Maladie de Siam," as he calls it, than all that has been written on the &s;ubject by others&mdash;to tho&s;e who are not practically acquainted with it.</NOTE></P>

Upon the whole therefore, if we draw our conclu&s;ion with re&s;pect to the diag|no&s;tic of this di&s;ea&s;e, from the remote and proximate cau&s;es, from the &s;ymptoms, from the di&s;&s;ections, I apprehend, we mu&s;t con|&s;ider it as truly pe&s;tilential, and differing from the plague &s;trictly &s;o called, only, in not always exhibiting the &s;ymptoms that are &s;aid to be peculiar to that malady.</P>
<P>The &s;udden manner in which this fever attacked, in every ca&s;e, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to admini&s;ter any thing in the way of pre|vention. Had the &s;ick, indeed, been al|ways &s;en&s;ible of the infection the in&s;tant it was applied, no doubt much might have been done in this way; but unfortunately
<PB N="150" REF="035302_0165_10021925E3D825C0">
this happened in very few in&s;tances, com|paratively &s;peaking; and when it did, none were willing to believe that any dangerous con&s;equence would en&s;ue. In the cure therefore of the di&s;ea&s;e, I was always obliged to begin at, or &s;oon after its actual inva&s;ion; but as the &s;ymptoms very &s;eldom directed to a proper knowledge of its true nature; and as the fatal termination often happened at a very early period, and unexpectedly, I found it a mo&s;t difficult as well as painful ta&s;k, for &s;ome time after the di&s;ea&s;e broke out, to form a plan of cure. Finding at length the total inefficacy of the u&s;ual method recommended in treating malignant fevers; and becoming by con&s;tant ob&s;er|vation on a multitude of ca&s;es, in its mo&s;t violent form, better acquainted with the di&s;ea&s;e, I founded my plan on the follow|ing rea&s;oning. It was evident, however indirectly marked by the &s;ymptoms, that the fir&s;t &s;tage of the fever was an inflam|matory diathe&s;is, peculiar in this re&s;pect, that its tendency to terminate in gangrene was infinitely greater than in any other di&s;ea&s;e I ever met with. It was no le&s;s evident that this &s;tage was &s;ucceeded by
<PB N="151" REF="035302_0166_100219278155C430">
one wherein nervous excitement and a pu|tre&s;cent diathe&s;is were equally remarkable, and equally tended with an uncommon ra|pidity to the di&s;&s;olution of the patient. It was al&s;o evident, that the&s;e diathe&s;es had an extraordinary aptitude to run into each other, without &s;howing any di&s;tinct ter|mination of the one, or acce&s;&s;ion of the other; and it appeared, that the imprudent u&s;e, or the anticipation of the means of obviating either of the&s;e &s;tates or diathe&s;es, inevitably ha&s;tened the progre&s;s of the other to its peculiar termination. Having the&s;e facts before me, it was clear that if I at once went on the antiphlogi&s;tic plan, I would, with certainty, anticipate the fatal i&s;&s;ue of the di&s;ea&s;e, by inducing an extreme degree of debility; and that, on the other hand, if I adopted at the commencement of my treatment, the anti&s;eptic plan, I would inevitably increa&s;e the tendency of the exi&s;ting inflammation to terminate in gangrene. Many proofs of both the&s;e fatal errors occurred daily for &s;ome time after the introduction of the di&s;ea&s;e; and &s;urely the practitioner could not be blamed when it is con&s;idered that the di&s;ea&s;e was new, and

unknown in the climate. From the fore|going data, the following indications natu|rally re&s;ulted, and always guided me in my future practice; for however varied the remedies might be, &s;till the&s;e were the points to be gained:</P>
<P N="1">1. To di&s;charge from the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines acrid and offen&s;ive humours.</P>
<P N="2">2. To obviate inflammatory diathe&s;is, without producing a tendency to putre&s;|cence.</P>
<P N="3">3. To moderate the tendency to putre&s;|cence, and to obviate it when actually pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="4">4. To re&s;tore tone and energy to the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In the remittent fever of the country, and indeed in every di&s;ea&s;e in which there is a bilious accumulation in the primae viae, I have generally u&s;ed a &s;olution of the na|tron vitriolatum and tartari&s;ed antimony in water, in preference to any other eva|cuating
<PB N="153" REF="035302_0168_1002192BE2F3F7B0">
medicine. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this &s;ingular advantage of effecting three evacuations in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time; and although a powerful emetic, it by no means occa&s;ions any untoward irritability of &s;tomach. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance I had recour&s;e to this excellent remedy, and gave it in the follow|ing manner: An ounce and an half of the &s;alts, and two grains of the tartari&s;ed antimony, being di&s;&s;olved in a pound and an half of pure cold water, a large wine-gla&s;sfull of the &s;olution was given every hour to the patient, until a &s;ufficient effect was produced, or till the whole of the quantity was taken. The two fir&s;t gla&s;sfulls generally operated as an emetic, and fully evacuated the &s;tomach; the medicine after this acted on the inte&s;tines, and excited a copious di&s;charge of their con|tents. If, at the &s;ame time, a diaphore&s;is broke out (and it almo&s;t always did) the patient found him&s;elf con&s;iderably relieved. I have &s;ometimes, however, dreading the con&s;equence of copious evacuation by &s;tool, contented my&s;elf with an emetic alone, com|po&s;ed of from ten to thirty grains of ipeca|cuanha, and one or two of the tartari&s;ed antimony; but any advantage derived from
<PB N="154" REF="035302_0169_1002192D890F2720">
this practice, did not compen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of time; for if a gentle purge was ad|mini&s;tered after the operation of the emetic, it took &s;everal hours to produce its effect: and if cly&s;ters were depended on, their ac|tion did not extend beyond the larger in|te&s;tines. In &s;everal ca&s;es of the third cla&s;s, and a very few of the &s;econd, in which my a&s;&s;i&s;tance was called for very early in the fever, I had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing a &s;peedy and complete termination put to the complaint, by the &s;olution. This, in|deed, was doing what has been recom|mended by Sir John Pringle, preventing the di&s;ea&s;e, or rather carrying off its fomites before they can act generally on the &s;y&s;tem; but perhaps the means were better. When the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared among us, fear of anticipating the irritability of &s;tomach, in|duced &s;ome practitioners, and my&s;elf before I became fully acquainted with the di&s;ea&s;e, to give at fir&s;t a pill of &s;olid opium, and after allowing an hour or two for its &s;olu|tion, to admini&s;ter the evacuating medicine; but for the rea&s;ons already given, the im|propriety of this practice mu&s;t be obvious. As it is highly probable, from the manner
<PB N="155" REF="035302_0170_1002192FBB291C70">
in which the contagion acted, that it was carried into the &s;y&s;tem chiefly by means of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, the importance of admini&s;tering a medicine which in the &s;horte&s;t &s;pace of time po&s;&s;ible will evacuate them, at the &s;ame time that it tends to ob|viate any general febrile affection which may have taken place, mu&s;t be evident. I have often derived con&s;iderable advantage from u&s;ing the bitter purging-&s;alts, in&s;tead of Glauber's, either in the &s;ame proportion, or a larger one; and I have rendered the &s;olution much more palatable by the addi|tion of lime-juice and &s;ugar.</P>
<P>To fulfil the &s;econd indication was infi|nitely more difficult; and the danger of making an improper choice of the means, much greater. The fate indeed of the pa|tient altogether depended on the judicious &s;election of means, in removing the inflam|matory without producing a tendency to putre&s;cent diathe&s;is.</P>
<P>It has been very generally recommended to draw &s;ome, blood before other means are u&s;ed, at the beginning of malignant and
<PB N="156" REF="035302_0171_10021932C40E6420">
pe&s;tilential fevers. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the ardent heat of the &s;urface, the oppre&s;&s;ed hard pul&s;e, the pain of the &s;ide, the oppre&s;|&s;ion at the praecordia, the headach, and the throbbing in the temples, &s;eemed &s;trongly to indicate the u&s;e of bleeding. Very little experience, however, was &s;ufficient to &s;hew the impropriety of it; and in&s;tructed by repeated examples of its hurtful effects, I very early laid a&s;ide all thoughts of le&s;&s;ening the inflammatory &s;tate by means of it. Al|though the blood, drawn in the ca&s;es wherein this remedy was employed, was remarkably florid, and always threw up an inflammatory cru&s;t of greater or le&s;s thickne&s;s; and although the pains &s;eemed to undergo a temporary mitigation, yet the con&s;equence at the expiration of a few hours was always fatal. I was the more &s;urpri&s;ed at this event, as the patients were remarkably robu&s;t, florid, and generally in the vigor of life.</P>
<P>Having thoroughly clean&s;ed the primae viae, my next object was to encourage a di|aphore&s;is, if it had already come on, which I have ob&s;erved often happened in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="157" REF="035302_0172_1002193456D26458">
of the u&s;e of the evacuating medi|cine; or if it had not, to promote one. For this purpo&s;e, I made u&s;e of various means; &s;uch as the &s;aline draughts of Rive|rius, with and without the addition of the aethereal &s;pirit of nitre or vitriol; and I often preferred this addition, on account of the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine. In all ca&s;es, the &s;ymp|toms of which did not run high, this was a mo&s;t u&s;eful medicine; and although the ta&s;te was often complained of, it &s;eldom de|ranged the &s;tomach. With this I generally gave a powder every two hours, compo&s;ed of nitre, camphor, and the pulvis antimo|nialis; and in order to give the&s;e medicines a greater tendency to act on the &s;kin, a few drops of laudanum were occa&s;ionally added to the draught, or a &s;mall proportion of opium joined to the powder. Per&s;everance in this plan, in the le&s;s violent ca&s;es, was &s;ometimes attended with complete &s;ucce&s;s; for the pul&s;e becoming &s;lower and &s;oft, the pains abating, and the &s;kin being covered with an agreeable moi&s;ture, all that remain|ed to complete the cure, was to prevent the tendency to putre&s;cence by the liberal u&s;e of bark, wine, and nouri&s;hing food.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="035302_0173_10021894B8A6EE00">
This &s;ucce&s;s, however, was confined to the third, and a very &s;mall part of the &s;e|cond cla&s;s of patients. The more violent ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e, in which the patients were hurried out of exi&s;tence, wherein the whole frame was agitated by a conflict the mo&s;t dreadful, demanded a treatment in which the mo&s;t vigorous and &s;peedy de|ci&s;ion, the bolde&s;t per&s;everance in the adopt|ed plan, and the clo&s;e&s;t attention and ob|&s;ervation became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. In the&s;e ca&s;es local inflammation was more clearly indicated than in others; but bleed|ing was, if po&s;&s;ible, a more dangerous re|medy here than in them. Finding all the antiphlogi&s;tics I had u&s;ed totally ineffectual, and that bleeding was on no account ad|mi&s;&s;ible, I had recour&s;e to the only remedy left me, mercury. I was encouraged to the practice by the appearances I ob&s;erved in the two fir&s;t bodies I opened. The liver was evidently the mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;ed part, and I knew that mercury was &s;pecific in all in|flamations of that organ; be&s;ides, it was at all events better to try a doubtful one than remedies of no efficacy. I accordingly admini&s;tered calomel either combined with
<PB N="159" REF="035302_0174_10021936B7247480">
nitre, camphor, and the antimonial powder, or in the form of a pill. After many trials of both, I preferred the la&s;t, chiefly on account of the nitre and camphor di&s;|agreeing with the &s;tomach. The pill was generally compo&s;ed of five grains of calo|mel, two of the antimonial powder, and one of opium; and repeated four times in the twelve hours, or eight in the twenty-four hours. I confe&s;s it was with no &s;mall degree of anxiety I ventured on this practice, unwarranted by any other authority than di&s;&s;ection and my own ob&s;ervation; but its &s;ucce&s;s ju&s;tified my temerity. If &s;alivation was &s;peedily rai&s;ed, the danger was re|moved, and the patient recovered. But in order to effect this, it was frequently ne|ce&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the quantity and number of the do&s;es; and, in &s;everal in&s;tances, I have pu&s;hed it to an almo&s;t incredible length, with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s. In one ca&s;e in particular, a gunner of the royal artillery, named Thomas Smith, in whom &s;igns of recovery did not appear till the twenty-fir&s;t day, fully 400 grains were given before the &s;alivary glands were af|fected.</P>

For &s;ome time the que&s;tion re&s;pecting the propriety and impropriety of this practice was much agitated among my fellow-practitioners. The principal arguments of|fered again&s;t it were founded on its no|velty; its militating again&s;t the received theory of the nature of malignant and pe&s;tilential fevers; and on the very limited duration of the di&s;ea&s;e, which, it was &s;aid, did not admit the admini&s;tration of a quan|tity large enough to excite &s;alivation, where|by, even was mercury u&s;eful, time &s;uffici|ent was not given it to act.

I mentioned to him the difficulties I had for &s;ome time laboured under, the re|&s;ult of my ob&s;ervations, and the treatment I found alone u&s;eful in the more violent ca&s;es; and recommended it to him as the mo&s;t likely to be &s;ucce&s;sful among his pa|tients. He immediately adopted it, and has &s;ince frequently declared to me, that

he did not lo&s;e afterwards one man, who had taken a &s;ufficient quantity of calomel to excite &s;alivation. Mr. White and my&s;elf were &s;triking in&s;tances of the efficacy of the practice; we were both infected, were very dangerou&s;ly ill, and cured by exciting &s;ali|vation.</P>
<P>By comparative want of &s;ucce&s;s in treat|ing this dreadful malady with any other means than tho&s;e I have mentioned, might render any account of them unnece&s;&s;ary. I &s;hall, however, offer a few ob&s;ervations on the mo&s;t remarkable of them, chiefly with a view to &s;how how inefficacious remedies &s;trongly recommended by expe|rienced and judicious writers in certain &s;tates of the malignant fever, were found to be in the di&s;ea&s;e before us.

In one of the&s;e, a &s;oldier of the royal artillery, the irritabi|lity of the &s;tomach was completely removed by a bli&s;ter applied to the &s;crobiculus cordis. The other ca&s;e was &s;ingular. In a trade&s;|man of the town of St. George, all the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e appeared, except the febrile heat. A bli&s;ter was applied be|tween the &s;houlders, without admini&s;tering any medicine previou&s;ly, except the &s;olu|tion, which operated very moderately. The effect was wonderful; the di&s;charge was uncommonly large, black, and foetid in an intolerable degree; and the in&s;tant this took place the patient became better; and &s;oon after, without the u&s;e of any other remedy, recovered. A medical gentleman of the army, at that time with the 67th regiment, informed me, that in his own ca&s;e, as well as tho&s;e of four or five &s;oldiers, he expe|rienced extraordinary relief from the appli|cation of a bli&s;ter to the forepart of the

head, or &s;inciput. It is probable that the ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e he treated were le&s;s violent than mo&s;t of tho&s;e which occurred in my practice; otherwi&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to ac|count for &s;o great a difference of re&s;ult in the &s;ame practice.</P>
<P>From the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e, it will not appear extraordinary that practitioners &s;hould have recour&s;e to bark very early in it. The &s;uddenne&s;s of the changes, and the apparent &s;inking of the vital powers a few hours after the acce&s;&s;ion of fever, naturally incline us to con&s;ider it as a di&s;ea&s;e wherein tonics and anti&s;eptics, with the whole tribe of cordials, could be alone u&s;eful. But no indication can be more fallacious than this; and innumerable in&s;tances occurred of the fatal con&s;equence of adopting it. The u&s;e of the bark in the violent ca&s;es of the malignant pe&s;tilential fever, immediately after the ope|ration of the evacuating medicines, was hurtful in the extreme; many continued the practice, notwith&s;tanding the glaring ab&s;urdity as well as danger of it. But by way of removing &s;pa&s;m, and obviating the tendency of the phlogi&s;tic &s;ymptoms, which
<PB N="171" REF="035302_0186_100219618FFB3B78">
they con&s;idered as unimportant, put in com|petition with the expected putrefaction, they accompanied it with warm bathing, either partial or general, and occa&s;ional purges. Their &s;ucce&s;s, as might be expected, was proportional to the unaptne&s;s of the means.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e wherein &s;alivation took place, little farther was required than the plentiful u&s;e of nouri&s;hing &s;imple food, and wines. But when the mercury had not this effect, or when its action was &s;o tardy as to give room for the mo&s;t &s;erious appre|hen&s;ions of the event, it was nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to the bark. This medicine, in remittent bilious fevers, is &s;eldom un|commonly di&s;gu&s;ting to the patient; for although the &s;tomach is very often irritable in the&s;e fevers, and con&s;equently incapable of retaining the bark, yet the patient &s;eldom expre&s;&s;es any di&s;like to &s;wallowing it. In this fever, however, this medicine was ex|tremely di&s;agreeable to the patient, and the irritability of the &s;tomach at the period when it became nece&s;&s;ary was &s;o great, as very frequently to baffle every attempt to
<PB N="172" REF="035302_0187_10021963251F5390">
render it retentive. Nature &s;eemed to point out the impropriety of admini&s;tering the bark, by not only rendering the palate ab|horrent to it, but exciting &s;uch a degree of &s;pa&s;m in the &s;tomach, as made that organ totally unequal to even the reception of it. Hence we are not to be &s;urpri&s;ed that the bark did &s;o little in this fever. In fact, except in the third, and part of the &s;econd cla&s;&s;es of patients, it was not a medicine to be depended on; and even in the&s;e, the &s;ucce&s;s was obtained chiefly by the agency of other medicines in re&s;toring &s;ome degree of tone to the &s;tomach. Opium, &s;o often u&s;eful in other fevers, attended with irri|tability of the &s;tomach, was in this &s;eldom beneficial. Burnt ardent &s;pirits &s;eemed to give a momentary relief; but it was merely momentary. Nor had a repetition of them a &s;imilar effect, for they were then in&s;tantly rejected. Bli&s;ters, I have already ob&s;erved, did almo&s;t no good in this way. Tincture of bark, or a very &s;trong infu&s;ion of it in Port-wine, was &s;ometimes u&s;eful. But aether was the only medicine that was in any degree truly and permanently beneficial in enabling the &s;tomach to receive and
<PB N="173" REF="035302_0188_100219659D099030">
retain the Peruvian bark. Many ca&s;es fully evinced this; and a few occurred in my practice, wherein the cure was completed by this medicine alone. The only writer I have met with, who recommends the u&s;e of aether in malignant pe&s;tilential fevers, is M. Poi&s;&s;onnier: "C'e&s;t dans ce <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ur|tout qu'on peut propo&s;er avec confiance quelques petites do&s;es d'&eacute;ther vitriolique &s;ur du &s;uore, afin de combattre plus efficace|ment la pourriture, et de retabler le ton de l'e&s;tomac, et de toutes les parties.

to try it in a malady that had hitherto re&s;i&s;ted all the means u&s;ually re|curred to. The event ju&s;tified the practice. I gave the aether in the following man|ner. The patient being allowed to re|main undi&s;turbed about an hour, I gave him about a tea-&s;poonful in about half a wine-gla&s;sfull of cool water. After this he continued undi&s;turbed about two hours, when the do&s;e was repeated. At the expi|ration of another hour, the bark was of|fered him; and if he &s;wallowed and re|tained it, the aether afterwards was given only once in five or &s;ix hours. But as this very &s;eldom happened, it was generally ne|ce&s;&s;ary to repeat the aether in the &s;ame quan|tity every three hours, till the &s;pa&s;m of the &s;tomach was entirely overcome. AEther, given in the manner I have mentioned, is extremely grateful to the patient; it occa|&s;ions an agreeable warmth along the oe&s;o|phagus, and gently &s;timulates the &s;tomach. This effect, however, does not continue long; but the frequent production of it at length gives it permanency. It appears to act as a tonic, an anti&s;eptic, and an agree|able &s;timulant; a warm glow over&s;preads

the &s;urface, and thir&s;t, nau&s;ea, and oppre&s;|&s;ion often have fled before it. I have gene|rally during the exhibition of the aether, and till the &s;tomach became retentive, or|dered bark to be admini&s;tered in the form of injections.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to injections of bark in general, a great deal cannot be expected from them. In the di&s;ea&s;e before us, when the ca&s;e was of the more violent kind, the &s;pa&s;m which affected the &s;tomach, prevailed more or le&s;s throughout the whole length of the inte&s;tinal canal; con&s;equently the injections were almo&s;t always immediately voided; or if they were retained, &s;o little of the anti&s;eptic part of the medicine was ab&s;orbed, as to be totally inadequate to com|bat the rapidly increa&s;ing putre&s;cence. In a &s;tate of the inte&s;tines &s;o highly morbid, the action of the ab&s;orbents mu&s;t have been imperfect; or if, with Dr. Cullen, we con|&s;ider the operation of bark as ari&s;ing merely from a tonic power, the &s;pa&s;modic &s;tate of the inte&s;tinal fibres mu&s;t have prevented any efficacy from its application to them. But as the tonic power of this medicine
<PB N="176" REF="035302_0191_1002196DEF41F620">
could be alone efficacious, I did all in my power to obviate the &s;pa&s;m, by anti&s;pa&s;|modics, by di&s;ten&s;ion of the fibres of the rectum and colon, and by the addition of Port-wine to the bark. The anti&s;pa&s;mo|dics I u&s;ed were, opium in watery &s;olution, a&s;afoetida, and camphor rendered &s;oluble in water by mucilage; but I derived very little benefit from any of them. The mo&s;t u&s;eful was the opium, of a &s;trong watery &s;olution, of which I generally added two tea-&s;poonfuls to an injection compo&s;ed of an ounce and an half of bark, and eight or ten ounces of water moderately warm, or of &s;trong chicken-broth or beef-tea. This injection was repeated, day and night, every three hours; and if uniformly retained, a laxative injection was admini&s;tered once in the twenty-four hours to carry off the accumulated bark, which, otherwi&s;e, gave the patient con&s;iderable unea&s;ine&s;s. With a view to overcome the &s;pa&s;m by di&s;ten&s;ion, I had a pint and a half of the above mix|ture injected into the rectum, and ordered an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to compre&s;s the anus with &s;ome degree of violence, by means of a towel well rolled up, the in&s;tant the pipe of the
<PB N="177" REF="035302_0192_1002196FA21D8540">
&s;yringe was withdrawn. This &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded, when the patient could be pre|vailed on to lie quiet in one po&s;ture; but in mo&s;t ca&s;es, the patient being comato&s;e, delirious, or re&s;tle&s;s, from the general un|ea&s;ine&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion which then prevail|ed, it could not be put in practice.<NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">In the very trouble&s;ome &s;pa&s;modic affection of the &s;tomach and oe&s;ophagus, particularly the latter, called Hiccup, or Singultus, proceeding from irregu|larities in diet, nothing &s;ooner or more effectually re|lieves than di&s;tention of the oe&s;ophagus by the detention of as large a quantity of very cold water, as po&s;&s;ible, in that pa&s;&s;age, for a minute or thirty &s;econds. This is ea&s;ily effected by throwing the head back, and putting the mu&s;cles of deglutition into action, in &s;uch a manner as to compre&s;s the oe&s;ophagus. I have often expe|rienced the good effects of this operation; and it was this which fir&s;t induced me to try the above practice.</NOTE> The total inability of the &s;tomach to receive either medicine or nouri&s;hment in many ca&s;es; and the inefficacy of the bark in|jections de&s;cribed, in obviating or correct|ing the tendency to putre&s;cence, at length induced me to u&s;e Port-wine, as the mo&s;t re&s;tringent, in&s;tead of the water, chicken-broth, or beef-tea. As the practice was not warranted by any medical authority, I

confe&s;s it was after &s;ome he&s;itation I ven|tured on it; and my he&s;itation aro&s;e chiefly from a fear of the irritation which the wine might occa&s;ion when applied to the tender &s;urface of the inte&s;tines; and, in a healthy &s;tate, perhaps very untoward &s;ymp|toms might be the con&s;equence. But in the pre&s;ent morbid &s;tate of the&s;e vi&s;cera, &s;o far from its producing irritation, I found it a mo&s;t u&s;eful, and not unfrequently a very efficacious practice. To two ounces of bark, I added as much Port-wine as ren|dered the mixture &s;ufficiently thin to pa&s;s through the pipe of the &s;yringe; and after adding the u&s;ual proportion of the &s;olution of opium, had it admini&s;tered every three hours, taking care to u&s;e a con&s;iderable de|gree of compre&s;&s;ion on the anus for &s;ome time after, to prevent its being too &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed. Although this medicine was by no means always effectual in &s;topping the pro|gre&s;s of putrefaction, yet it was infinitely more &s;o than any other anti&s;eptic combi|nation u&s;ed in this way, when the &s;to|mach did not admit of the exhibition of bark in any other. Per&s;everance, however, was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to pro|duce
<PB N="179" REF="035302_0194_100219751E223FA8">
the de&s;ired effect; and it was al&s;o equally nece&s;&s;ary to leave the &s;tomach un|di&s;turbed, as long as any irritation remained in it.</P>
<P>Frequently baffled in my endeavours to fulfil the third indication of cure, by the ex|hibition of the bark in the forms I have de|&s;cribed; and often induced from many of the &s;ymptoms, as well as the general cha|racter of the di&s;ea&s;e, to con&s;ider it as a plague or pe&s;tilence; I had, in a few ca&s;es, recour&s;e to the practice de&s;cribed by Dr. Guthrie, and &s;aid by him to be uncommonly &s;uc|ce&s;sful in the treatment of the plague by the Ru&s;&s;ian phy&s;icians. I followed it exactly, with this exception only, that the dread of producing or increa&s;ing irritability, pre|vented me from repeating the emetics &s;o frequently as recommended by the Ru&s;&s;ian phy&s;icians. The re&s;ult of this practice is laid down in the foregoing table, from which it appears, that as the number of un&s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es was exactly equal to the recoveries, the encouragement to proceed was not very great. One of the patients treated in this way, Martin Gray, a &s;oldier
<PB N="180" REF="035302_0195_1002197770B2CFE8">
of the royal artillery, had been apparently cured by mercury, without its producing &s;alivation; but having relap&s;ed, I put him on this cour&s;e. After a flattering but mo|mentary change on the fifth, he died on the &s;eventh day. Another of the &s;ame corps, Richard Ducket, had recovered in the &s;ame manner, by means of mercury, but relap&s;ing, he was treated in this method, and recovered. This difference of re&s;ult in circum&s;tances exactly parallel, mu&s;t have ari&s;en from the former being a recruit ju&s;t arrived from Europe; the latter, near three years in the climate.</P>
<P>It may not, perhaps, be con&s;idered as foreign to my &s;ubject, to remark here, that in the furunculus, which prevailed very generally almo&s;t immediately after the ma|lignant pe&s;tilential fever had abated about the end of Augu&s;t or beginning of Septem|ber, I found the combination of bark and &s;ulphur, which forms part of the above plan, a mo&s;t excellent remedy in increa&s;ing the eruption, and promoting the &s;uppu|ration. The&s;e furunculi, or as they are com|monly called, Blind-boils, were very large,
<PB N="181" REF="035302_0196_10021979D4044480">
&s;eldom le&s;s than an inch in diameter, very painful, and di&s;charged a very uncommon quantity of purulent matter, frequently mixed with ichor. They appeared on every part of the body; but in greate&s;t number near the &s;crotum, the hips, and on both upper and lower extremities.</P>
<P>Wi&s;hing to leave nothing untried that promi&s;ed any relief to my patients in this fatal malady, I determined on trying what the Angu&s;tura bark would do. On a for|mer occa&s;ion, this bark &s;eemed u&s;eful in an irregular fever depending on local di&s;|ea&s;e. Since then, I have read Mr. Brand's "Experiments and Ob&s;ervations on the An|gu&s;tura Bark," wherein its efficacy, as an an|ti&s;eptic and tonic, are highly commended in various &s;tates of fever. Encouraged by the&s;e, and perceiving that this bark po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a pungency or &s;picy ta&s;te, a quality which the Peruvian bark had in a very inferior degree, I made u&s;e of it, in expectation that by gently &s;timulating the &s;tomach, and thereby obviating the &s;pa&s;m with which that organ was affected, it might have a better chance of being retained. I did
<PB N="182" REF="035302_0197_1002197B682BB8D0">
not begin to u&s;e this medicine till towards the end of July, and gave it in only twelve ca&s;es. Five of the&s;e were &s;oldiers of the royal artillery; and the remaining &s;even, inhabitants and tran&s;ient people. The for|mer recovered with remarkable rapidity, and three of the latter; &s;o that only one in three died. Although this &s;ucce&s;s was greater than I expected, I did not think my&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in tru&s;ting altogether to the An|gu&s;tura bark, when I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a re|medy more certain in its effect, and of who&s;e &s;afety exten&s;ive experience had fully &s;atisfied me. From the event, however, it was evidently a more &s;uitable medicine than the Peruvian bark. Three of the five of the artillery, who took the Angu&s;tura bark were young men, who had never entered the torrid zone before, and were almo&s;t total &s;trangers to the climate; and tho&s;e who died were &s;ailors, who had only lately arrived from Europe. It was evident there|fore, that although frequently an u&s;eful medicine, and although it generally agreed with the &s;tomach, it was by no means to be &s;afely depended on in ca&s;es of great violence. I always preceded the admini|&s;tration
<PB N="183" REF="035302_0198_100219509F74FE68">
of this medicine with the deob|&s;truents and diaphoretics I have already mentioned; and after the operation of the&s;e, I gave a &s;cruple of the powder of the An|gu&s;tura bark mixed with water, every hour, or two &s;cruples in three hours. In the eight ca&s;es wherein this practice was &s;ucce&s;sful, I was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee an almo&s;t immediate change take place; for in&s;tead of the heat being increa&s;ed, and the &s;urface becoming dry, which too often followed the too early u&s;e of the Peruvian bark, an agreeable glow, an increa&s;e of warm &s;weat, and a diminution of pain were the con&s;e|quences. For in&s;tance, if the patient was &s;eized with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms on the evening, I had immediately the vomit ad|mini&s;tered, and repeated if nece&s;&s;ary; this was followed up, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, by the cooling diaphoretic, or with the &s;aline draughts, with a &s;ufficient addition of the bitter cathartic &s;alts; or in&s;tead of all the&s;e, the &s;olution of &s;alts and tartari&s;ed antimony, in the manner already de&s;cribed. The&s;e having operated &s;ufficiently during the night, I began the u&s;e of the Angu&s;tura bark in the morning. By the following evening,
<PB N="184" REF="035302_0199_1002197FE5B7BF18">
all the &s;ymptoms were relieved; and on the &s;econd morning, the patient was up, walked a little, and had &s;ome appetite; and from that time, u&s;ing occa&s;ionally the Angu&s;tura bark, he continued to recover. How dif|ferent this from the effect of the Peruvian bark; nau&s;ea, vomiting, heat, dry &s;kin, quickened pul&s;e, increa&s;ed pain; often &s;uc|ceeded by coma, delirium, &amp;c. and &s;eldom admini&s;trable without aether. Upon the whole it appeared, that the inefficacy of the Angu&s;tura bark in the more violent ca&s;es, aro&s;e from the irritability of the &s;to|mach being greater, and le&s;s tractable in them; and from an in&s;ufficiency of the an|ti&s;eptic power in the bark it&s;elf.<NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">From &s;ome experiments I made, after the above &s;ucce&s;sful exhibition of the Angu&s;tura bark in the malignant pe&s;tilential fever, with a view to di&s;cover to what particular qualities it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, this &s;ucce&s;s was to be attributed, I was induced to refer it to an uncommon quantity of fixed air or aerial acid, and to a volatile alkali which this bark appeared to contain. As however experiments of this kind are often &s;ubject to deception, I &s;hall not take upon me to &s;peak with cer|tainty on the &s;ubject. But in order that the experi|ments I allude to may be repeated by tho&s;e more ex|perienced in this way than I am, I &s;hall in&s;ert them here. "In order to di&s;cover whether this infu&s;ion, made of one ounce of the powder of Angu&s;tura bark in eight ounces of water, contained any fixed air or aerial acid, I added to one ounce of it filtered, a &s;mall quantity of filtered lime-water. The infu&s;ion became immediately turbid, and of a dirty yellow colour approaching to white, and depo&s;ited &s;oon after, on the &s;ides and bot|tom of the gla&s;s, a &s;mall quantity of a greyi&s;h-white powder. The infu&s;ion, after the powder &s;ub&s;ided com|pletely, was perfectly tran&s;parent, and of a beautiful amber-colour." "To two ounces of the infu&s;ion, I added a &s;mall quantity of a watery &s;olution of corro&s;ive &s;ublimate. The mixture became in&s;tantly whiti&s;h, which, no doubt, had the colouring matter of the bark been wanting, would have been milky; a whiti&s;h powder was &s;oon after precipitated." The infu&s;ion of pale Peruvian bark &s;uffered no change on the ad|dition of lime-water; but with the addition of the wa|tery &s;olution of corro&s;ive &s;ublimate, it became in&s;tantly whiti&s;h, and a precipitation of a whiti&s;h powder took place. The anti&s;eptic power of this medicine in in|fu&s;ion is evidently extremely weak, but not &s;o in powder; thus, the infu&s;ion with fre&s;h meat becomes highly offen&s;ive in thirty hours, in the common tem|perature of the air; that is, in a heat at an average about 83 degrees of Farenheit; but a piece of meat of equal weight, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> two drams, well rubbed with the powder and wrapped in a piece of paper, placed in the &s;ame heat, was perfectly &s;weet at the end of ten days, no other &s;mell being perceptible but that of the bark. Does this corroborate the re&s;ult of the above experi|ments? And is not the remarkable efficacy of this medicine in dy&s;entery, which I have frequently expe|rienced, to be attributed to the powers a&s;cribed to it here?

from the orbits, low &s;pirits, thir&s;t, and a total want of appetite, were the general con&s;equences of the treatment with bark, without the previous u&s;e of deob&s;truents, and the appropriate antiphlogi&s;tic. None of the&s;e unplea&s;ant feelings attended con|vale&s;cence, when the di&s;ea&s;e had been re|moved by mercurials; and I had frequently rea&s;on to imagine, that a &s;erous accumu|lation continued in the brain a con&s;iderable time after the di&s;appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e, when treated in the former way. Com|pre&s;&s;ion indeed was evidently indicated by the appearance of the eyes, the continual headach, a frequent nau&s;ea, and a tendency to &s;tupor and &s;leepine&s;s; and as no means were u&s;ed during the exi&s;tence of the di&s;|ea&s;e to excite an ab&s;orption of the exhaled fluid in the brain, it was highly probable that the compre&s;&s;ion aro&s;e from this defi|ciency. Although nothing of this kind fol|lowed the mercurial plan, extreme debility was the immediate con&s;equence of the di&s;|ea&s;e in all ca&s;es.

To obviate this evil, a change of air and &s;ituation became ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary the moment &s;igns of con|vale&s;cence appeared; and indeed, of all the means I know for recovery from this &s;tate of debility, it is the mo&s;t efficacious. Even the in&s;tant the patient was carried into the open air, he was &s;en&s;ible of a wonderful degree of refre&s;hment; and the purer the atmo&s;phere, and the higher the &s;ituation of the place, provided there was no dampne&s;s, the &s;peedier was his acqui&s;ition of &s;trength. The in&s;tances of this were innumerable; as were likewi&s;e tho&s;e of a contrary treatment. The 45th regiment afforded one of the mo&s;t remarkable of the former. The &s;ick &s;oldiers, as &s;oon as they were able to bear any degree of motion, were &s;ent to Ho&s;pital-hill, where they were kept till they acquired their u&s;ual health; which happened in a &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;hort time. The di&s;tance from Fort George, where the regiment was &s;tationed, to the
<PB N="189" REF="035302_0204_1002198A33543A70">
barracks on Ho&s;pital-hill, is fully a mile; and the a&s;cent for the mo&s;t part is very con|&s;iderable. Although the &s;ick, at the time they began their walk, or ride, from the Fort were apparently &s;o weak and languid as to be &s;carce able to bear exerci&s;e, before they reached their barracks, in&s;tead of being overcome with fatigue, they were &s;en&s;ibly better and &s;tronger. The change to a purer air, a high rocky &s;ituation, abundance of good water, and the di&s;tance from infection, produced an alteration in a few days; and this was rendered &s;till more remarkable, by their accommodation being cold and ex|po&s;ed to the weather; for the barracks in which they were lodged, were &s;o much decayed as to admit the rain and wind al|mo&s;t every-where. Under circum&s;tances which did not admit of changes of this nature, much benefit to the patient accrued from the moving him from the infected chamber to one adjoining. In the ho&s;pitals this was frequently done, and always with the be&s;t con&s;equences. I have even ex|tended this removal to that &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e which immediately &s;ucceeds the in|flammatory, and frequently with evident

advantage; nor is it to be wondered at, &s;ince it is ea&s;y to conceive that the violence of a contagious di&s;ea&s;e will increa&s;e in propor|tion to the accumulation of infection in the atmo&s;phere immediately &s;urrounding the per&s;on afflicted with it. Something of this kind was done on &s;hip-board, where the accommodation was in general wretchedly bad and confined. In a few of the &s;hips, the captains had the humanity to give up their cabins altogether to the &s;ick; and in the&s;e, the &s;ick enjoying &s;ufficient room, good air, and better ventilation than between decks, the mortality was infinitely le&s;s. As I con&s;idered cleanline&s;s and free venti|lation as two principal agents in de&s;troy|ing contagion, I always enjoined particular attention to them: where the&s;e were more immediately in my own power, nothing was left undone to effect them. In the royal artillery ho&s;pital, when the di&s;ea&s;e was almo&s;t at its height of violence, I had all the wards &s;ucce&s;&s;ively white-wa&s;hed; in doing which I effected another object, the removal of the &s;ick from the infected wards to others that were not &s;o.

Twice or thrice in the week, moi&s;tened gunpowder was burnt in each ward; and thrice in the day, the floors and bed&s;teads of the &s;ick were &s;prinkled with vinegar.

Suitable diet was the next means of re|&s;toring tone and energy to the &s;y&s;tem. During the exi&s;tence of the di&s;ea&s;e, it was of little importance whether the patient took nouri&s;hment or not; and indeed, from the circum&s;tances under which the &s;ick ge|nerally laboured, it is evident that nothing material in this way could be admini&s;tered.

Another ve&s;&s;el from New London touched at St. Pierre, in her way to Grenada, and received the infection. On her arrival, in February, 1794, the &s;ick were put under my charge; and I found the di&s;ea&s;e to be my old enemy, the malignant pe&s;tilential fever.

All writers agree in this; and the ob&s;ervations of Dr. Guthrie have thrown
<PB N="202" REF="035302_0217_100219A4873DE1C0">
much light on the manner in which the&s;e cau&s;es act to produce &s;o dreadful an effect. Baron de Tott has given the public a mo&s;t important ob&s;ervation with re&s;pect to the manner in which the plague is propagated at Con&s;tantinople: "Qui qu'il en &s;oit ii n'y a point d'incertitude &s;ur le foyer qui la con&s;erve, ni &s;ur les cau&s;es que la propagent. On retrouve l'un et l'autre, chez les mer|chands fripiers de Con&s;tantinople, et chez les particuliers qui con&s;ervent dans leurs coffres tous les v&ecirc;tements, les fourures m&ecirc;mes des per&s;onnes mortes de la pe&s;te.

Into the&s;e &s;inks of pe&s;tilence and de&s;tructive di&s;&s;ipation, captains of ve&s;&s;els, during the prevalence of the malignant pe&s;|tilential fever, induced by the apparent cheapne&s;s of the accommodation, hurried their wretched &s;ailors labouring under the di&s;ea&s;e in its wor&s;t form.

they became the &s;eminium of the di&s;ea&s;e, and were the principal means of propa|gating it. Another cau&s;e contributed not a little to &s;upport the contagion: From the indolence peculiar to all cla&s;&s;es of people in this climate, and from the novelty of the thing it&s;elf, few paid the nece&s;&s;ary attention to &s;weetening and ventilating the rooms of the &s;ick when the di&s;ea&s;e cea&s;ed; from this it frequently happened that a healthy per&s;on on entering any of the&s;e infected rooms, was in&s;tantly &s;truck with the infec|tion. The&s;e facts demon&s;trate, that means are always in the power of the inhabitants of the torrid zone to check or prevent con|tagion. That the di&s;ea&s;e therefore might have been prevented in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and that the propagation of it afterwards might have been confined to tho&s;e places which fir&s;t received the infection, is certain, had the nature of it been properly under|&s;tood, and had laws which oblige the ob|&s;ervance of quarantine been in exi&s;tence, But much, very much depends on indi|vidual prudence, as well as public policy; and it is to be feared that plans of preven|tion, however well adapted they may be

<P>The means of prevention which more im|mediately depend on the prudence and ex|ertion of individuals, have been &s;o often and &s;o ably &s;tated by writers on this &s;ubject, as to render it unnece&s;&s;ary for me to enlarge on them here. When an individual of a family has been &s;eized with a contagious or pe&s;tilential fever, care &s;hould be taken to prevent all, except tho&s;e who are nece&s;&s;ary in attending him, from going into the room in which he is confined; if he recovers, the bed-clothes and wearing apparel which he u&s;ed during his illne&s;s, &s;hould be as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible de&s;troyed by fire; his per&s;on well wa&s;hed, and dre&s;&s;ed with clothes that cannot be &s;ubject to &s;u&s;picion; he &s;hould be carried into the country, if po&s;&s;ible, and re|main in it till he acquires his u&s;ual degree of &s;trength: the room he lay in &s;hould be

new painted if wain&s;cotted, or white-wa&s;hed if otherwi&s;e; and the floor and ceiling, doors, window-&s;hutters, &amp;c. &s;hould be well &s;crubbed, and the whole afterwards fumi|gated with moi&s;tened gunpowder; the at|tendants, before they again mix with &s;ociety, &s;hould be obliged to purify their per&s;ons, and change their clothes. When the di&s;|ea&s;e appears on &s;hip-board, the &s;ick &s;hould be in&s;tantly &s;eparated from the healthy, and carried to a place on &s;hore, from which the infection cannot &s;pread; the &s;pace be|tween decks, the hold, the cabin, &s;hould be immediately well &s;crubbed, and, if it can be done, white-wa&s;hed; fires &s;hould be lighted in the hold and between decks, and whil&s;t they are burning, the hatches &s;hould be kept clo&s;e &s;hut; and the whole for &s;everal days &s;hould be carefully fumigated and &s;prinkled with vinegar. But as the hammocks and mattre&s;&s;es of &s;eamen are more &s;ubject to re|ceive and retain infection than any thing el&s;e on board, the greate&s;t care &s;hould be taken to wa&s;h them well; and if any have been u&s;ed by the &s;ick, to burn them. A re|markable in&s;tance of the efficacy of the&s;e means of prevention on &s;hip-board, I have
<PB N="211" REF="035302_0226_100219B6B8A2BBC8">
at pre&s;ent (February 20th, 1794) before me. The &s;hip Mary of Liverpool, of 26 guns and 70 men, received the infection either from an American ve&s;&s;el, the crew of which had been infected at Martinique, or from the rum-&s;hops I have already de&s;cribed. I advi&s;ed the captain to &s;eparate the &s;ick from the healthy, and if po&s;&s;ible to &s;end them on &s;hore; and afterwards to wa&s;h all the decks well with vinegar, to light fires be|tween decks and in the hold, and to fu|migate the whole with gunpowder. He complied with my directions, and the re&s;ult has been mo&s;t happy; for after the four in whom the di&s;ea&s;e appeared were &s;ent on &s;hore, and the means I have mentioned were u&s;ed, the di&s;ea&s;e entirely cea&s;ed to &s;pread. I may ob&s;erve here, that &s;ome of the methods recommended in Europe for preventing the &s;preading of a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, are not always nece&s;&s;ary, the cli|mate it&s;elf in &s;ome circum&s;tances doing what in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, mu&s;t be done by artificial means. I &s;hall only mention two in&s;tances. It is by no means nece&s;&s;ary, or rather it is augmenting the virulence of the contagion, to &s;hut up

families in their hou&s;es, when an individual of it has been &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e. I have already ob&s;erved, that the &s;phere of infectious atmo&s;phere in this climate, has in no in&s;tance exceeded ten feet; and that all beyond that, have remained untaint|ed. It therefore is evident, that a mea|&s;ure of this kind would not only be unne|ce&s;&s;ary, but extremely hurtful; for con|fined air in the torrid zone, becomes in a very &s;hort time totally unfit for re&s;pira|tion, however large the rooms may be: a proof of which is the oppre&s;&s;ion and other unea&s;y &s;ymptoms a per&s;on is &s;en&s;ible of in a room, the doors and windows of which are clo&s;e &s;hut. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, what has been propo&s;ed by Dr. Lind, if executed in this climate, would produce an effect in every re&s;pect rever&s;e of that which that ingenious and experienced phy&s;ician ex|pected from it. His propo&s;al is, that "the di&s;per&s;ed &s;ick &s;hould be carefully collected into one place, and the hou&s;es be purified on their removal; as others are taken ill, they &s;hould al&s;o be immediately put with the &s;ick, and in a &s;hort time, the infection

It is therefore ho&s;pitals, unle&s;s they have been con&s;tructed on a very large &s;cale, that have always been hurtful. On every account, &s;eparate rooms are better, were they even huts, providing due care is taken to ventilate them properly, and keep them clean. A &s;triking illu&s;tration of this is, what happened in the royal ar|tillery ho&s;pital of this i&s;land, already related; and it is the more de&s;erving of attention, as the ho&s;pital is a &s;tone building, &s;ituated in the mo&s;t favourable &s;ituation po&s;&s;ible for ventilation; as the rooms are large, lofty, and well perflated in every direction; and as every thing is kept remarkably clean and &s;weet.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s or duty lead them to the chambers of the &s;ick, &s;hould be par|ticularly careful to avoid entering them with

an empty &s;tomach; or when they are heated; or when they are in per&s;piration. The la&s;t caution is more particularly to be attended to, as the pores of the &s;kin in that &s;tate, may be con&s;idered as &s;o many open mouths ready to receive and &s;wallow the infectious effluvia; which no po&s;&s;ible means can pre|vent. The u&s;ual manner of u&s;ing the aro|matic gums, or keeping camphorated or aromatic vinegar to the no&s;e, or &s;u&s;pending &s;mall bags of camphor, mu&s;k, a&s;afoetida, &amp;c. on the brea&s;t, as I have already ob|&s;erved, have not the &s;malle&s;t efficacy in pre|venting infection when the body is expo&s;ed to it. But as it is evident that the conta|gious effluvia do not extend them&s;elves be|yond a limited di&s;tance from the infected per&s;on, &s;o the be&s;t preventive mu&s;t of cour&s;e be the taking care not to go nearer the &s;ick, if po&s;&s;ible, than the limits of the infected at|mo&s;phere. The duty, however, of phy&s;i|cians, nur&s;es, and other nece&s;&s;ary attendants, mu&s;t render their ob&s;erving that precaution impo&s;&s;ible; they mu&s;t therefore tru&s;t more to their temperance than prophylactics of this kind for exemption from infection. One caution, however, may be u&s;eful even

to them, if &s;trictly ob&s;erved. It is probable that the matter of contagion enters the body more readily by the lungs and &s;to|mach, than by the &s;kin; con&s;equently, if care be taken to keep the mouth and no&s;trils &s;hut during the examination of the patient or the more immediate attendance on his per&s;on, by means of handkerchiefs &s;prink|led with any anti&s;eptic fluid, particularly camphorated vinegar, or the little balls re|commended by Dr. Lind, there will be le&s;s ri&s;k of their receiving the infection. Al|though I have little faith in amulets, and indeed none of the tribe recurred to here were u&s;eful during the prevalence of the malignant pe&s;tilential fever, perhaps the &s;in|gular one mentioned by Dr. Lind, may be employed on the&s;e occa&s;ions with advan|tage. I mean the quill filled with quick-&s;ilver, and corked at each end, carried in a pocket near the groin, which the Doctor &s;ays, "&s;everal &s;urgeons in our ho&s;pitals, who had recour&s;e to it, imagined it was attended with &s;ucce&s;s."<NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lind's E&s;&s;ays, p. 346.</NOTE> In general, both as preventive of infection and as a means of rendering

the di&s;ea&s;e milder, every thing po&s;&s;ible &s;hould be done to keep the room cool, and &s;o ventilated as that whil&s;t a con&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h to infected or foul air takes place, no current of it can immediately affect the per&s;on of the &s;ick; and in ad|dition to its fre&s;hne&s;s, no doubt much ad|vantage will ari&s;e from &s;aturating it with anti&s;eptic particles; &s;uch as tho&s;e which ari&s;e from boiling vinegar, burning cam|phire, and other &s;ub&s;tances of the &s;ame na|ture. I may here al&s;o mention the u&s;e of vitriolic aether, the evaporation of which in an infected atmo&s;phere, may have an ex|cellent effect in purifying it, and perhaps rendering healthy per&s;ons le&s;s obnoxious to the action of contagion. I have met with no writer who recommends this me|dicine as a prophylactic, but M.

But as, notwith&s;tanding the ju&s;tice and hu|manity of M.

The rubbing the bed-po&s;ts with a little of this, and &s;prinkling it on places mo&s;t liable to receive and retain infection, would, I have no doubt, be infinitely be|neficial.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the evident nece&s;&s;ity exi&s;ting for the adopting a plan &s;uch as that I have propo&s;ed for the prevention of infection, and de&s;troying it when it appears on &s;hip-board, it is probable that the cau&s;es I have mentioned may always render the mea&s;ure abortive. If therefore no proper places are cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e of per|forming quarantine, and no lazarettoes are built, &s;ome other temporary expedient mu&s;t be thought of in an emergency &s;o pregnant with mi&s;chief. At the time the malignant pe&s;tilential fever began to rage on &s;hip-board,
<PB N="218" REF="035302_0233_100219C5B8995D58">
and before it was communicated to the inhabitants, &s;everal expedients were propo&s;ed to &s;top its progre&s;s; but none were put in execution. Among the&s;e, I &s;ugge&s;ted to many of the captains, and &s;ome of the principal inhabitants, the following: The carenage or harbour is &s;ituated at the bottom of a very exten&s;ive bay, and &s;o com|pletely &s;urrounded by land, as to be per|fectly &s;ecure again&s;t every wind, except the S. W. which &s;eldom blows. The opening into this fine ba&s;on is on the S. W. and is formed by two rocky promontories, on one of which Fort St. George &s;tands; the other is private property, but perfectly barren, and &s;o &s;ituated with re&s;pect to the inhabited part of the neighbouring country, as to be in a manner in&s;ulated. On this I propo&s;ed to have tents, formed of &s;ails and &s;pars, pitched, in which the &s;ick from the dif|ferent &s;hips were to be lodged; temporary cooking places and privies were to be erected in the rear of the encampment; and proper nur&s;es, and careful &s;en&s;ible negroes, as la|bourers, were to be employed. After land|ing and lodging the &s;ick, &s;uch &s;hips as had no part of their cargoes on board, were to
<PB N="219" REF="035302_0234_100219C74F8A31F8">
put in practice all the u&s;ual means of de|&s;troying infection; and others were to do the &s;ame thing after re-landing the &s;ugar and other produce they had taken on board. To prevent the &s;preading of the infection from this encampment, centinels were to be po&s;ted in &s;uch a manner as would effectually prevent &s;tragglers from it or to it. It cer|tainly requires no more than the &s;imple de|&s;cription of the plan to &s;hew its utility; and, &s;ure I am, had it been adopted, all the &s;ub|&s;equent mortality and &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s might have been altogether prevented.</P>
<P>During the prevalence of a pe&s;tilential fever, the great prophylactics are temper|ance in eating and drinking; regularity in exerci&s;e; the proper di&s;tribution of time with re&s;pect to &s;leep and watching; atten|tion to cleanline&s;s of per&s;on; and the avoid|ing &s;uch gratifications as have a tendency to weaken the vital powers. The words of Cel&s;us in his "Ob&s;ervatio in Pe&s;tilentia," or fevers ari&s;ing from mar&s;h effluvia, are very comprehen&s;ive: "vitare fatigationem, cruditatem, frigus, calorem, libidinem; mul|toque magis &s;e continere." Whil&s;t the
<PB N="220" REF="035302_0235_100219C981630E88">
pe&s;tilential fever raged here, the utility of the&s;e means was remarkably illu&s;trated by the almo&s;t total exemption of the French inhabitants from the di&s;ea&s;e. Their mode of living, compared to that of the Engli&s;h, is temperate and regular, in an uncommon degree; animal food and &s;trong liquors are very moderately u&s;ed by them; vegetables and &s;mall red-wine chiefly compo&s;e their diet; their pa&s;&s;ions are &s;eldom excited to any degree bordering on exce&s;s; their minds &s;eem in general tranquil, or actuated by a vivacity peculiar to them&s;elves; and de|pre&s;&s;ion, or that &s;tate of the animal &s;pirits they call Ennui, is never perceived to have place among them. The event too among the negroes, more e&s;pecially tho&s;e employed in the cultivation of plantations, affords another &s;triking proof of the great benefit re&s;ulting from temperance during the ex|i&s;tence of pe&s;tilence; for although it is pro|bable that the negro race po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething con&s;titutional which re&s;i&s;ts the action of contagion in a very great degree, &s;till it mu&s;t be admitted that their nece&s;&s;ary tem|perance mu&s;t have contributed much in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance to their exemption from
<PB N="221" REF="035302_0236_100219CC42DF9498">
or to the mildne&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e when it appeared among them. Many of the emi|grants from the French i&s;lands, particularly Martinique, who from their unhappy &s;itu|ation could not accommodate them&s;elves with their cu&s;tomary modes of living, and who&s;e minds, &s;uffering under the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;appointment and deprivation of pro|perty, were &s;ubject to an unnatural de|pre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits: and &s;ome French pri|&s;oners, who, at this time, were obliged to live on &s;alted animal food, and to u&s;e rum diluted for their drink, which articles com|po&s;ed the ration of provi&s;ions allowed them by government, did not enjoy the exemp|tion their countrymen, inhabitants of the i&s;land, experienced. Many of the former, and all the latter had the di&s;ea&s;e; and many fell victims to it. Want of cleanline&s;s and due ventilation could have little &s;hare in increa&s;ing the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e among the pri&s;oners; for their confinement was limited to the extent of the ridge of Ho&s;|pital-hill; from the purer air of which the 45th regiment had immediately before de|rived &s;o much benefit.</P>

&s;hivering, which were very &s;oon after fol|lowed by convul&s;ions that continued about two hours, as he was told; for he was by no means &s;en&s;ible him&s;elf either of their pre&s;ence or duration.

A &s;olution of &s;alts and tartar emetic was immediately given; but not having operated well, on the 11th he had a bolus of ten grains of calomel,

followed up by a bri&s;k purge of jalap. By means of the&s;e, the &s;ymptoms having con|&s;iderably abated, he began the u&s;e of the Peruvian bark on the 12th. In the even|ing of that day, however, he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with delirium, and in the night-time, taking advantage of the quiet in the ho&s;|pital, he &s;tole out, and walked to the bar|racks, at lea&s;t a mile di&s;tance; in which the commanding officer, imagining he was intoxicated, had him confined. On being brought back the following morning, he had every appearance of fatuity, low fever, cold clammy &s;weats, dilated pupils, and &s;taring eyes. With the utmo&s;t difficulty the a&s;&s;i&s;tants could keep him confined to bed.

15th. The powders occa&s;ioning irritabi|lity of the &s;tomach, a pill was &s;ub&s;tituted of five grains of calomel, and a grain and a half of opium.</P>
<P>16th. Notwith&s;tanding the u&s;e of the pills, which agreed well with him, the more untoward &s;ymptoms, coma, low de|lirium at times, cold clammy &s;weats came on &s;o rapidly, as to induce me to di&s;con|tinue the calomel all this day and the fol|lowing, and to give bark and wine. The&s;e, however, had no effect; his &s;tate &s;eemed de&s;perate; and perceiving, with the &s;ymp|toms mentioned, the dilatation of the pupils, I had again recour&s;e to the calomel on the</P>

In the evening, matters becoming wor&s;e, ordered &s;ixteen grains of calomel to be given at one do&s;e. The quantity taken, including this to-day, forty grains.</P>
<P>20th. The &s;ame. Fifty grains of calomel to be given at three times, with opium.</P>
<P>21&s;t. In addition to the calomel, I now ordered as much &s;piced Port-wine, and bark and Port-wine, to be given to him as he could po&s;&s;ibly take.</P>
<P>22d. Still the &s;ame. Took fifty-four grains of calomel, and four pints of &s;piced wine ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>23d. As he &s;till continued in the &s;ame &s;tate, and as a black fur had formed on his teeth, gums, and tongue, I was afraid to pu&s;h the calomel any further. He had already taken 254 grains without its purg|ing him, and without &s;howing any di&s;po&s;i|tion to act on the &s;alivary glands. I there|fore now left him to Nature, only endea|vouring

to a&s;&s;i&s;t her by the plentiful u&s;e of &s;piced wine, and bark and wine. In this &s;tate he continued till about noon of the 24th, when a gentle &s;pitting came on, which, however, di&s;appeared about mid|night. With a view to encourage and bring on the &s;alivation, I had his head well wrapped in flannel; and his neck and jaws frequently anointed with warm camphorated oil; and he &s;till continued the bark and &s;piced wine. By means of the&s;e, a gentle &s;alivation was again brought on, and continued till the third of July, when carbuncles broke out all over his body, par|ticularly in the mo&s;t fle&s;hy parts: &s;ome of the&s;e were as large as a &s;mall pullet's egg; but in general they were of the &s;ize of a pigeon's egg. Tho&s;e of them which opened naturally were dre&s;&s;ed with dige&s;tive ointment, and the others had a poultice applied to them.

<P>16th. Had 76 grains of calomel &s;ince ye&s;terday morning; the la&s;t 20 without opium; in con&s;equence of which, he had two &s;tools.

A bli&s;ter that was applied to the head, and one to the in&s;ide of each thigh, in the even|ing of ye&s;terday, ro&s;e well; but during the night delirious at times; at pre&s;ent coma and clammine&s;s of the &s;urface, although pul&s;e 100. and pretty full, with &s;ome degree of hard|ne&s;s.

<P>17th. In the cour&s;e of the night &s;ome|times delirious; calm and collected at pre|&s;ent, but coma and clammine&s;s of the &s;ur|face &s;till continue.

is very much affected in the malignant pe&s;|tilential fever, this, as an anti&s;pa&s;modic, will be found a mo&s;t u&s;eful medicine; and given, mixed with the anti&s;eptic, will have the double advantage of quieting the general irregular motions of the nerves, and of act|ing on the &s;tomach in &s;uch a manner as to enable it to retain the medicine with which it is combined.

and con&s;titution, aged 25, on the evening of the 29th of Augu&s;t, a few days after his arrival on the i&s;land, was &s;eized with all the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of the malignant pe&s;tilential fever in the more violent degree. This gen|tleman had heard before his arrival of the dreadful deva&s;tation committed by this di&s;|ea&s;e; and knew that three other officers, who had &s;ome time before cro&s;&s;ed the At|lantic in the &s;ame &s;hip with him, had fallen &s;acrifices to it in the very hou&s;e in which he was then quartered. The&s;e circum&s;tances had impre&s;&s;ed him with a ju&s;t dread of the evil he had much rea&s;on to expect, and no doubt added very con&s;iderably to the na|tural violence of the &s;ymptoms. After being well evacuated by means of a vomit of ipecacuanha and tartar-emetic, and a &s;o|lution of &s;alts and tartar-emetic, and a pro|fu&s;e diaphore&s;is having broken out by noon of the 30th, he began the Angu&s;tura bark in do&s;es of a &s;cruple, repeated every hour. The two fir&s;t he retained; but afterwards, the in&s;tant the bark reached the &s;tomach, it was rejected. During the remainder of this day, all the 31&s;t, and greate&s;t part of the 1&s;t of September, the irritability continued.
<PB N="265" REF="035302_0280_10021A3295ED4800">
Neither medicine nor nouri&s;hment could be retained; his &s;kin became dry, his tongue and fauces parched, the former of a brown|i&s;h colour; a weakening di&s;charge by &s;tool came on, of a mo&s;t foetid &s;mell and blacki&s;h colour. I gave him calomel joined to &s;olid opium all the 31&s;t; but this pa&s;&s;ing off by &s;tool, increa&s;ed the general weakne&s;s, with|out a po&s;&s;ibility of its acting on the &s;alivary glands. He now again tried the Angu&s;tura bark, but in vain; and as nothing el&s;e could be at all effectual in &s;topping the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, I determined to per&s;evere in it, in hopes of its being at length wholly re|tained, or at lea&s;t &s;uch a portion of it as might be &s;ufficient to prevent gangrene. In the night-time, he him&s;elf propo&s;ed that this bark &s;hould be mixed in &s;ome &s;trong wine or &s;pirit, which might prevent its re|jection. Capt. D'Arcy, of the &s;ame corps, who carefully attended him, luckily recol|lected that he had by him &s;ome infu&s;ion of Peruvian bark in Port-wine, that had been made upwards of a month before; and of this he gave Mr. Watkins an half wine-gla&s;sful, and repeated it at the end of two hours. Its effect was a&s;toni&s;hing; for

when, at the expiration of two hours more, a do&s;e of Angu&s;tura bark in water, with ten drops of laudanum, was given, he &s;wal|lowed it without di&s;gu&s;t, and kept it. From this time he continued the Angu&s;tura bark with the laudanum, and, retaining it, was, when I &s;aw him on the 2d about noon, by which time he had taken and retained twelve do&s;es, totally free from fever; ea&s;y in every re&s;pect; his &s;kin agreeably cool, with a general warm moi&s;ture on it; the &s;taring prominency and redne&s;s of his eyes had almo&s;t entirely di&s;appeared.

On vi&s;iting him on the 3d, I found a change had taken place in the night; he &s;uddenly became delirious, the protru&s;ion and &s;taring of his eyes returned, every mu&s;cle was affected with tremor; but his &s;kin continued cool, and his &s;tomach &s;till retained the Angu&s;tura bark. When I &s;aw him he was nearly in this &s;tate, only the coolne&s;s of the &s;kin was attended with a clammy moi&s;ture. Together with the bark,

<P>4th. During the night the delirium in|crea&s;ed much, and alternated with coma; the mu&s;cular &s;pa&s;m was much more violent; the &s;urface of his body was cold and clam|my, and &s;ome vibices appeared on the neck. The bli&s;ter ro&s;e remarkably well, and his &s;tomach continued remarkably retentive; this was his &s;tate, with the addition of in|&s;en&s;ibility, when I &s;aw him near noon. A curious circum&s;tance (ob&s;erved by the at|tendants frequently, and by my&s;elf once) was the rapid change and alternate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of colour of the &s;kin, from very pale to dingy, or livid, or to bright yellow; the&s;e &s;ucceeded each other in the &s;pace of a few minutes; at the end of which, his &s;kin became of the u&s;ual dirty, livid hue, pe|culiar to the complaint. An hour after, the alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would come on again; and after continuing the &s;ame length of time, would be &s;ucceeded by the livid co|lour, and &s;o on. About four in the after|noon,
<PB N="268" REF="035302_0283_10021A394E29CB20">
a violent convul&s;ion came on, and continued a few minutes; his re&s;piration became now extremely oppre&s;&s;ed, and he frequently, as if by a natural impul&s;e, laid his hand acro&s;s the pit of the &s;tomach; the mu&s;cular &s;pa&s;m now increa&s;ed &s;o much as to &s;hake the bed with much violence. About &s;ix o'clock, another violent convul&s;ion car|ried him off. During the two la&s;t days he took upwards of three ounces of the An|gu&s;tura bark, and fully three bottles of Port-wine, with a good deal of nouri&s;hment, which indeed he generally had a craving for.</P>

AFTER fini&s;hing the foregoing little ESSAY, it was not my intention to add any thing further on the &s;ubject. Since then, however, &s;o many aditional, and if po&s;&s;ible more powerful, proofs have occurred of the &s;uperior efficacy of the Mercurial Treatment in the Malignant Pe&s;tilential Fe|ver, that I &s;hould con&s;ider my&s;elf as acting unju&s;tly to the Public, as well as wanting in humanity, did I withhold a &s;hort account of them, by way of Po&s;t&s;cript to what I have already written.</P>

THE year 1794, whil&s;t it unhappily pro|duced many hundred in&s;tances of the ma|lignant pe&s;tilential fever in Grenada, al&s;o afforded the mo&s;t unequivocal proofs of the &s;uperior efficacy of mercury in the treatment of that dreadful malady. Although in one in&s;tance the di&s;ea&s;e was evidently introduced by an American ve&s;&s;el from Martinico, in the month of February; and in another, by an Engli&s;h trader from the &s;ame i&s;land, after its capture, yet it is highly probable, that, from the cau&s;es I have mentioned, the town of St. George has been at no time &s;ince the fir&s;t introduction of the di&s;ea&s;e by the Hankey, in February, 1793, intirely clear of the infection; the rum-&s;hops having been a never-failing receptacle of it. The want of &s;ubjects to act on, might &s;u&s;pend the operation of the contagion for a time; but the arrival of &s;trangers, to whom it has uniformly been deleterious, gave life to its &s;eeds, which had hitherto been concealed, not de&s;troyed.</P>

As it formerly not unfrequently hap|pened, from the nece&s;&s;ary timidity a practi|tioner feels who adopts a new remedy in the treatment of one of the mo&s;t dangerous and de&s;tructive maladies the human frame is &s;ubject to, that that remedy was not al|ways pu&s;hed to the length which &s;ecures its efficacy; &s;o on the reappearance of the di&s;|ea&s;e, I was determined to give the calomel earlier, and in much greater quantity than the preceding year. Accordingly, in&s;tead of preceding the admini&s;tration of this ex|cellent remedy with the u&s;ual evacuating medicines, I began with it, and continued it without the interpo&s;ition of any other, till &s;alivation took place. The &s;ucce&s;s at|tending this practice exceeded my mo&s;t &s;an|guine expectation; &s;o great indeed was it, that I did not lo&s;e a &s;ingle patient in who&s;e ca&s;e it was pu&s;hed to the full extent. My practice will, no doubt, by many be con&s;i|dered as unwarrantably bold; but as its wonderful &s;ucce&s;s has been experienced by &s;everal other practitioners, who can bear te&s;|timony to it, I feel not the &s;malle&s;t he&s;itation in recommending it with all the fervor which an earne&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ave the lives of
<PB N="272" REF="035302_0287_10021A4162F7ACE8">
men, and the fulle&s;t conviction of, I am almo&s;t inclined to &s;ay, its infallibility, can give ri&s;e to.</P>
<P>My mode of u&s;ing the calomel &s;ince the reappearance of the di&s;ea&s;e, is to give ten grains to an adult patient as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible after I &s;ee him. This generally acts as an aperient in the degree required, about an hour or two after it is given. At the end of three hours I repeat the &s;ame do&s;e without opium, if the fir&s;t had not purged more than twice. At the end of three hours more, the &s;ame quantity is given, adding opium or not, as the pre|ceding do&s;es have acted. In this manner ten grains are given every three hours till the &s;alivary glands become affected; which ge|nerally happens in le&s;s than twenty-four hours from the commencement of the treat|ment. The effect of the medicine given in this manner, may be perceived after the third do&s;e in general; the patient becoming calmer, le&s;s re&s;tle&s;s, le&s;s anxious; his &s;kin being &s;ofter, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an agree|able heat; the &s;tomach being perfectly re|tentive, however irritable it might have
<PB N="273" REF="035302_0288_10021A42F7473EC0">
been before; and the eyes recovering their former lu&s;tre and &s;en&s;ibility. When, at length, &s;alivation takes place, the patient is left free from di&s;ea&s;e, with a moderate warm moi&s;ture on his &s;kin; and very &s;oon after, &s;igns of returning health are indicated by calls for food, &amp;c. The recovery of &s;trength is proportionally rapid to that from di&s;ea&s;e; nor is it at all nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to bark, or any other medicine what&s;oever: a circum&s;tance truly gratify|ing both to the patient and phy&s;ician, in a di&s;ea&s;e wherein Nature revolts at the very idea of it. In fact, calomel is the only medicine, except the occa&s;ional addition of opium, I have latterly given; of cour&s;e the practice has been as &s;imple as it has been efficacious: an additional encouragement to the practitioner, and to tho&s;e who&s;e &s;itua|tion may render them liable to receive the pe&s;tilential infection.</P>
<P>On my way to Europe, in the month of July la&s;t, I was detained a month at St. Chri&s;topher's, waiting for convoy. During that time, I had frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing on the malignant pe&s;tilential
<PB N="274" REF="035302_0289_10021A452F2D1A48">
fever with &s;ome ingenious and eminent practitioners of that i&s;land; who informed me, that the want of &s;ucce&s;s they expe|rienced in the various modes of treatment they adopted during the prevalence of that epidemic, in the latter months of 1793, made them dread a &s;econd vi&s;it of it as the greate&s;t calamity that could befal the colony, At this time the arrival of a &s;hip at Ba&s;&s;e|terre from Martinico, with the malignant pe&s;tilential fever on board, gave me an op|portunity of di&s;playing the efficacy of the mercurial treatment; which had never before been thought or heard of there. Dr. Arm&s;trong, who to the mo&s;t plea&s;ing man|ners of a gentleman adds uncommon me|dical ability, and the candor which always accompanies both, attended the &s;ick on board this ve&s;&s;el. The fir&s;t patient was a &s;trong, robu&s;t man, &s;ome time before arrived from Europe, and who had the further di&s;ad|vantage of having been three days ill before medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be called in. The wor&s;t &s;ymptoms had already appeared; &s;uch as continual vomiting, coma, and the de|lirium peculiar to the di&s;ea&s;e. The Doctor, by my advice, began with ten grains of
<PB N="275" REF="035302_0290_10021A47F2C41FD0">
calomel, and repeated it without opium, as it did not purge, every three hours. To his a&s;toni&s;hment, and contrary to the prog|no&s;tic of the other medical gentlemen to whom he communicated the ca&s;e, a &s;ali|vation coming on before the expiration of twenty-four hours, the u&s;ual &s;igns of re|turning health immediately after &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Since my arrival in England, I have had peculiar &s;atisfaction in finding that a treat|ment nearly &s;imilar to the above had been adopted with great &s;ucce&s;s in the malignant pe&s;tilential fever, which &s;o fatally prevailed at Philadelphia during the autumn of 1793. Dr. Ru&s;h's medical talents and merit are too well known and too generally acknow|ledged to require the feeble efforts of my pen to extol them. If any thing, however, could add to the excellence of this gentle|man's character, it mu&s;t be his benevolent exertion, and unwearied per&s;everance dur|ing the exi&s;tence of this dreadful calamity, in relieving his helple&s;s and afflicted fel|low-citizens, and in pur&s;uing the mer|curial mode of treatment, with the weight of prejudice and malignity in oppo&s;ition
<PB N="276" REF="035302_0291_10021A498B23FD60">
to him. Such fortitude is rarely met with in the medical profe&s;&s;ion; and when it is, it mu&s;t &s;ecure our admiration and re&s;pect. Whether the di&s;ea&s;e de&s;cribed by Dr. Ru&s;h, under the name of the "Bilious Remitting Yellow Fever," was produced in the man|ner the malignant pe&s;tilential fever was in Grenada, is a matter of no great import|ance; it is &s;ufficient to know, that the di&s;|ea&s;es were exactly the &s;ame; and that a &s;imilar treatment proved &s;ucce&s;sful in both. I have al&s;o had uncommon &s;atisfaction in reading the following note in the ingenious Dr. Clark's late publication: "Ob&s;ervations on the Di&s;ea&s;es which prevail in long Voy|ages to Hot Countries," &amp;c. vol. II. p. 297. "When engorgement of the brain takes place, to any con&s;iderable degree, in fevers, no medicine which has hitherto been re|commended is capable of removing it; and therefore I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed for pro|po&s;ing mercury (the only medicine which has been found adequate to remove ob&s;ti|nate conge&s;tions in the other vi&s;cera) in &s;uch a deplorable and dangerous &s;ituation. But, at the &s;ame time, I confe&s;s I am not able to point out the particular ca&s;es to which
<PB N="277" REF="035302_0292_10021A4B450DC320">
this practice will apply, from not being able, certainly, to di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>engorgement</HI> of the brain from mere <HI>irritability</HI> of that organ; the &s;ymptoms in both being &s;imilar." I tru&s;t the ob&s;ervations I have offered in the foregoing &s;heets will remove the difficulty &s;tarted by Dr. Clark, and direct the practi|tioner, in the exhibition of mercury, in malignant pe&s;tilential fevers, at lea&s;t to tho&s;e &s;tadia of the di&s;ea&s;e wherein it is the only remedy that can be given with advan|tage. I am confident, not from analogy, or the probability of the thing it&s;elf, but from actual and very exten&s;ive experience, that mercury is, in general, the only truly u&s;eful medicine in all fevers depending on conge&s;tions it the vi&s;cera; or, as I have expre&s;&s;ed it in another place,<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Medical Commentaries. vol. 19.</NOTE> on glandular ob&s;truction and vi&s;ceral inflammation. And is it not probable that all fevers depend, proximately, on tho&s;e cau&s;es? Upon the whole, the weight of evidence in favour of the mercurial treatment brought forwards by Dr. Clark, Dr. Ru&s;h, Dr. Wade, and
<PB N="278" REF="035302_0293_10021A4E1CE1F390">
my&s;elf, in circum&s;tances nearly &s;imilar, mu&s;t &s;urely impre&s;s every mind, even tho&s;e mo&s;t influenced by prejudice and theory, with a conviction not only of its utility, but of its certainty, if judiciou&s;ly conducted.</P>
<P>In India, in England, in North America, and the We&s;t India i&s;lands, medical gen|tlemen, totally unconnected with each other, have recurred to the &s;ame practice, and he&s;itate not to declare to the public, that the event has been uniformly the &s;ame.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to your de&s;ire, I have &s;ent you the hi&s;tory of the yellow fever as it appeared here in the year 1748, which, as far as I can remember, agreed in its &s;ymptoms with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, when it vi&s;ited this town in former years. In <HI>this</HI> hi&s;tory, I have confined my&s;elf to a faith|ful narration of facts, and have avoided any phy&s;ical inquiry into the cau&s;es of the &s;everal &s;ymptoms in this di&s;ea&s;e; as that would have required more lei&s;ure than I am, at pre&s;ent, ma&s;ter of, and would per|haps have been le&s;s u&s;eful than a plain de|&s;cription.</P>

I wrote this hi&s;tory, &s;o far as it relates to the &s;ymptoms and progno&s;tics, in the year 1748, when we had the di&s;ea&s;e la&s;t in this place; intending afterwards, if it return|ed, to add, from further experience, the method of cure, and likewi&s;e an account of any other &s;ymptoms which might at|tend it; but as no &s;uch opportunity has offered, I mu&s;t now omit that part. How|ever, I hope the de&s;cription which I have given of this dreadful malady, which &s;o frequently rages like the plague in the &s;outhern parts of America, is &s;o full, that a phy&s;ician may, from thence, not only form a true judgment of its nature, but likewi&s;e be able to deduce and communi|cate &s;ome more certain method of cure, than has perhaps hitherto been u&s;ed.</P>

<P>II. THIS fever does not &s;eem to take its origin from any particular con&s;titution of the weather, independent of <HI>infectious mia&s;mata,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Warren</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his Treati&s;e concerning the malignant fever in Barbadoes, page 8.</NOTE> has formerly well ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>FOR within the&s;e twenty-five years, it has only been four times epidemical in this town, namely, in the autumns of the years 1732, 39, 45 and 48, though none of the&s;e years (ex|cepting that of 1739, who&s;e &s;ummer and autumn were remarkably rainy) were either
<PB N="284" REF="035302_0298_10021A31023406A0">
warmer or more rainy (and &s;ome of them le&s;s &s;o) than the &s;ummers and autumns were in &s;everal other years, in which we had not one in&s;tance of any one being &s;eized with this fever; which is contrary to what would probably have happened, if particular con&s;ti|tutions of the weather were productive of it, without infectious <HI>mia&s;mata.</HI> But that this is really an infectious di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eems plain, not only from this, that almo&s;t all the nur&s;es catched it and died of it; but likewi&s;e, as &s;oon as it appeared in town, it &s;oon invaded new|comers, tho&s;e who never had the di&s;ea&s;e be|fore, and country-people when they came to town, while tho&s;e who remained in the coun|try e&s;caped it, as likewi&s;e did tho&s;e who had formerly felt its <HI>dire</HI> effects, though they walk|ed about the town, vi&s;ited the &s;ick in all the different <HI>&s;tadia</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e, and attended the funeral of tho&s;e who died of it. And la&s;tly, whenever the di&s;ea&s;e appeared here, it was ea&s;ily traced to &s;ome per&s;on who had lately arrived from &s;ome of the We&s;t-Indian I&s;lands, where it was epidemical. Although the in|fection was &s;pread with great celerity through the town, yet if any from the country receiv|ed it in town, and &s;ickened on their return
<PB N="285" REF="035302_0299_10021A59FA90E3B0">
home, the infection &s;pread no further, not even &s;o much as to one in the &s;ame hou&s;e.</P>
<P>III. THE &s;ubjects which were &s;u&s;ceptible of this fever, were both &s;exes of the white colour, e&s;pecially &s;trangers lately arrived from cold climates, Indians, Mi&s;tees, Mulat|toes of all ages, excepting young children and of tho&s;e only &s;uch as had formerly e&s;caped the infection. And indeed it is a great happi|ne&s;s that our con&s;titutions undergo &s;uch al|terations in the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les and yel|low fever, as for ever afterwards &s;ecure us from a &s;econd attack of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. There is &s;omething very &s;ingular in the con&s;titution of the Negroes, which renders them not lia|ble to this fever; for though many of the&s;e were as much expo&s;ed as the nur&s;es to the infection, yet I never knew one in&s;tance of this fever among&s;t them, though they are equally &s;ubject with the white people to the <HI>bilious fever.</HI></P>
<P>IV. THIS fever began in the middle or rather towards the end of Augu&s;t, and con|tinued till near the middle of October, when the weather became cold enough to prevent

Towards the termination of the fever, the pul&s;e be|came &s;maller, harder, and le&s;s frequent. In &s;ome there was a remarkable throbbing in the carotids and in the <HI>hypochondria;</HI> in the latter of which it was &s;ometimes &s;o great, that it cau&s;ed a con&s;tant tremulous motion of the <HI>abdomen.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>heat,</HI> generally, did not exceed 102 degrees of Farenheit's thermometer; in &s;ome it was le&s;s, it varied frequently, and was commonly nearly equal in all parts, the heat about the <HI>praecordia</HI> being &s;eldom more inten&s;e than in the extremities, when the&s;e were kept covered.

di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ome had frequent returns of a &s;en&s;e of chillne&s;s, though there was not any abate|ment of their heat. In a few, there hap|pened &s;o great a remi&s;&s;ion of the heat for &s;ome hours, when at the &s;ame time the pul&s;e was &s;oft and le&s;s frequent and the &s;kin moi&s;t, that one from the&s;e circum&s;tances might rea&s;onably have hoped that the fever would only prove a remittent or intermit|tent.

<P>ON the fir&s;t day, the &s;weating was com|monly profu&s;e and general; on the &s;econd day, it was more moderate: but on both the&s;e, there happened frequent and &s;hort re|mi&s;&s;ions of the &s;weatings; at which times the febrile heat increa&s;ed, and the patient became more unea&s;y. On the third day, the di&s;po&s;ition to &s;weat was &s;o much abated, that the &s;kin was generally dry; only the forehead and backs of the hands continued moi&s;t.</P>

<P N="7">7.

<P N="17">17. THE <HI>&s;tools,</HI> after the fir&s;t day, were fetid, inclined to a black colour, and were very rarely bilious, &s;oft or liquid, excepting when forced by art; for an ob&s;tinate co&s;tive|ne&s;s attended the febrile &s;tate.</P>

<P>VII.

No; this fever did not terminate in either of the&s;e &s;alutary ways, excepting in &s;ome, who were happy enough to have the di&s;ea&s;e conquered in the

beginning by proper evacuations, and by keeping up a plentiful &s;weat, till the total &s;o|lution of the fever, by proper mild diapho|retics and diluents. But tho&s;e who had not that good fortune, however tranquil things might appear at this period, (as great debi|lity and a little yellowne&s;s in the white of the eyes, &s;eemed then to be the chief com|plaints, excepting when the vomiting con|tinued), yet the face of affairs was &s;oon chan|ged; for this period was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by the &s;econd <HI>&s;tadium;</HI> a &s;tate, though without any fever, much more terrible than the fir&s;t: the &s;ymptoms in which were the following.</P>
<P>VIII. 1. THE <HI>pul&s;e,</HI> immediately after the rece&s;s of the fever, was very little more fre|quent than in health, but hard and &s;mall. However, tho' it continued &s;mall, it became, &s;oon afterwards, &s;lower and very &s;oft; and this &s;oftne&s;s of the pul&s;e remained as long as the pul&s;e could be felt. In many, in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, the pul&s;e gradually &s;ub&s;id|ed, until it became &s;carce perceptible; and this, notwith&s;tanding all the means u&s;ed to &s;upport and fill it; and when this was the ca&s;e, the icteritious-like &s;uffu&s;ion, the vo|miting

<HI>delirium,</HI> re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> increa&s;ed to a great degree. In &s;ome, the pul&s;e, after being exceedingly &s;mall and &s;carce percepti|ble, recovered con&s;iderably its fullne&s;s; but that favourable appearance was generally of but &s;hort continuance.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>heat</HI> did not exceed the natural animal heat; and when the pul&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, the &s;kin became cold, and the face, brea&s;t and extremities acquired &s;omewhat of a livid co|lour.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>&s;kin</HI> was dry when the weather was cold, but was moi&s;t and clammy when the weather was hot.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>re&s;piration</HI> was natural or rather &s;low.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE <HI>tongue</HI> was moi&s;t and much clean|er than in the former (VI. 5.) &s;tage, its tip and edges, as al&s;o the gums and lips, were of a more florid red colour than u&s;ual.</P>

7. THE <HI>vomiting</HI> or <HI>reaching</HI> to vomit in|crea&s;ed, and in &s;ome was &s;o con&s;tant, that neither medicines nor aliment of any kind were retained. Some vomited blood; others only what was la&s;t exhibited, mixed with phlegm; and others again had what is called the <HI>black vomit.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That which is called the <HI>black vomit,</HI> at fir&s;t &s;ight, ap|pears to be black; but on a more careful examination, I ob&s;erved, that this colour proceeded from a great quantity of &s;mall, flakey, black &s;ub&s;tances which floated in the liquor thrown up by vomit; but the colour of this liquor was much the &s;ame with that which the patient had la&s;t drank, and was by no means black. Tho&s;e black flakey &s;ub&s;tances are the bile mixed with, or adhering to the <HI>mucus</HI> which lined the &s;tomach. For, upon di&s;&s;ection of tho&s;e who died of this di&s;ea&s;e, not only in this but former years, I always ob&s;erved that the <HI>mucus</HI> of the &s;tomach was abraded, and the bile in its <HI>cy&s;tis</HI> was black and &s;ometimes very vi&s;cid. In a lad who died of this di&s;ea&s;e in the beginning of the fourth day, and who was immediately opened, the bile was not only black, but had the con&s;i&s;tence of thick <HI>Venice</HI>-tur|pentine, and was exceedingly tough. On the in&s;ide of the &s;tomach, there were &s;everal carbuncles or gangrenous &s;pecks.

<P N="8">8. THE inquietude was very ob&s;tinate, and when they dozed, their &s;lumbers were but &s;hort and unrefre&s;hing. There were &s;ome who were drow&s;y; but the&s;e always awaked, after the &s;horte&s;t &s;lumbers, with a great de|jection of &s;pirits and &s;trength.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE <HI>jactations</HI> or re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s was &s;ur|pri&s;ing; it was frequently &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to keep the patients in bed, though, at the &s;ame time, they did not complain of any anxiety or unea&s;ine&s;s; but if a&s;ked how they did, the reply was, <HI>Very well.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. THE <HI>debility</HI> was &s;o great, that, if the patient was rai&s;ed erect in the bed, or, in &s;ome, if the head was only rai&s;ed from the pillow, while a cup of drink was given, the pul&s;e &s;unk immediately, and became &s;ome|times &s;o &s;mall, that it could &s;carcely be felt; at this time, they became cold, as in a <HI>hor|ripilatio,</HI> but without the an&s;erine-like &s;kin:

their &s;kin became clammy, the <HI>delirium</HI> in|crea&s;ed, their lips and &s;kin, e&s;pecially about the neck, face and extremities, together with their nails, acquired a livid colour.</P>

<P N="12">12. THE inflammation of the <HI>tunica con|junctiva</HI> or white of the eyes increa&s;ed much, but without pain.</P>
<P N="13">13.

in &s;moothne&s;s, tenacity, colour and con&s;i&s;|tence.</P>
<P N="18">18. THE <HI>urine</HI> was di&s;charged in a large quantity, in proportion to the drink retain|ed by the patient: it was pale if the patient was not yellow; but if yellow, then it was of a deep-&s;affron colour; in either ca&s;e it had a &s;ediment, or at lea&s;t a large cloud, which remained at the bottom of the gla&s;s; in &s;ome, it was very turbid, in others, it was bloody, and the quantity of blood di&s;charged with the urine bore always &s;ome proportion to the &s;tate of the pul&s;e; when that became fuller, the quantity of blood in the urine was dimini&s;hed: when the pul&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, the bloody urine increa&s;ed, and even returned af|ter it had cea&s;ed &s;ome days, &s;oon after the pul&s;e became &s;maller.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e continued &s;ome|times &s;even or eight days before the patient died.</P>
<P>IX. WHEN this <HI>&s;tadium</HI> (VIII.) of the di&s;|ea&s;e terminated in health, it was by a rece&s;s or abatement of the vomiting, haemorrhagies,
<PB N="301" REF="035302_0315_10021A7A9ACCE2B8">
<HI>delirium,</HI> inquietude, jactations, and icteri|tious-like &s;uffu&s;ion of the &s;kin and white of the eyes; while, at the &s;ame time, the pul&s;e became fuller, and the patient gained &s;trength, which, after this di&s;ea&s;e, was very &s;lowly.</P>
<P>BUT when it terminated in death, tho&s;e (VIII.) &s;ymptoms not only continued, but &s;ooner or later increa&s;ed in violence, and were &s;ucceeded with the following, which may be termed the <HI>third &s;tadium</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e, which quickly ended in death.</P>
<P>X. THE pul&s;e tho' &s;oft became exceeding|ly &s;mall and unequal; the extremities grew cold, clammy and livid; the face and lips, in &s;ome, were flu&s;hed; in others, they were of a livid colour; the livid &s;pecks increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, that in &s;ome, the whole brea&s;t and neck appeared livid; the heart palpitated &s;trongly; the heat about the <HI>praecordia</HI> in|crea&s;ed much; the re&s;piration became diffi|cult, with frequent &s;ighing; the patient now became anxious, and extremely re&s;tle&s;s; the &s;weat flowed from the face, neck and brea&s;t; blood flowed from the mouth, or
<PB N="302" REF="035302_0316_10021A7C2D307758">
no&s;e or ears, and in &s;ome, from all tho&s;e parts at once; the deglutition became diffi|cult; the hiccoughs and <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus</HI> of the tendons came on, and were frequent; the patients trifled with their fingers, and picked the naps of the bed-cloaths; they grew co|matous, or were con&s;tantly delirious. In this terrible &s;tate, &s;ome continued eight, ten or twelve hours before they died, even after they had been &s;o long &s;peechle&s;s, and with|out any perceptible pul&s;ation of the arteries in the wri&s;ts; whereas, in all other acute di&s;ea&s;es, after the pul&s;e in the wri&s;ts cea&s;es, death follows immediately. When the di&s;|ea&s;e was <HI>very</HI> acute, violent convul&s;ions &s;eized the unhappy patient, and quickly brought this <HI>&s;tadium</HI> to its fatal end. After death, the li|vid blotches increa&s;ed fa&s;t, e&s;pecially about the face, brea&s;t, and neck, and the putre|faction began very early, or rather increa&s;ed very quickly.</P>
<P>XI. THIS was the progre&s;s of this terrible di&s;ea&s;e through its &s;everal <HI>&s;tadia.</HI> But in hot weather, and when the &s;ymptoms in the fir&s;t &s;tage were very violent, it pa&s;&s;ed thro' tho&s;e &s;tages, as Dr. <HI>Warren</HI> has likewi&s;e ob&s;erved,
<PB N="303" REF="035302_0317_10021A7DCA172528">
with &s;uch precipitation, that there was but little opportunity of di&s;tingui&s;hing its diffe|rent <HI>&s;tadia;</HI> the whole tragedy having been fini&s;hed in le&s;s than 48 hours.</P>
<P>XII. IT was remarkable, that, 1. The infection was increa&s;ed by warm and le&s;&s;ened by cold weather. 2. The &s;ymptoms in the &s;everal <HI>&s;tadia</HI> were more or le&s;s violent, ac|cording to the heat or coolne&s;s of the wea|ther. In hot days, the &s;ymptoms were not only more violent, but in tho&s;e who &s;eemed, in moderate weather, to be on the recovery, or at lea&s;t in no danger, the &s;ymptoms were all &s;o greatly heightened, when the weather grew con&s;iderably warmer, as frequently to become fatal. In cool days, the &s;ymptoms were not only milder, but many, who were apparently in great danger in hot days, were &s;aved from the very jaws of death by the weather becoming happily cooler. 3. The di&s;ea&s;e was generally more fatal to tho&s;e who lay in &s;mall chambers not conveniently &s;itu|ated for the admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air, to tho&s;e of an athletic and full habit, to &s;trangers who were natives of a cold climate to tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t dread of it, and to
<PB N="304" REF="035302_0318_10021A808C480EE8">
tho&s;e, who, before the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, had overheated them&s;elves by exerci&s;e in the &s;un, or by exce&s;&s;ive drinking of &s;trong li|quors; either of which indeed &s;eemed to render the body more &s;u&s;ceptible of the in|fection. La&s;tly, the di&s;ea&s;e proved mo&s;t certainly fatal to valetudinarians, or to tho&s;e who had been weakened by any previous di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>XIII. THE <HI>progno&s;tics</HI> in the fir&s;t <HI>&s;tadium</HI> are the&s;e. 1. The more acute and con&s;tant the pains are in the head, loins, knees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the more the eyes are inflamed; the greater their inability is to bear light, and the more the face is flu&s;hed at the fir&s;t attack, the fever and all the &s;ymptoms (VI.) in the fir&s;t <HI>&s;tadium</HI> will be the more violent. 2. The more inten&s;e the &s;ymptoms are in the fir&s;t &s;tate, the &s;ooner will the fever terminate. 3. The &s;ooner the di&s;ea&s;e runs thro' the fir&s;t <HI>&s;tadium,</HI> the &s;horter will be the duration of the &s;econd, and <HI>&egrave; contra.</HI> 4. The &s;horter the duration is of the fir&s;t, the greater and more certain is the danger in the &s;econd &s;tate. For when the fever terminated before the beginning of the third day, death &s;eemed
<PB N="305" REF="035302_0319_10021A82B854E600">
inevitably to be the con&s;equence, as there was then no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting the pul&s;e, and as all the bad &s;ymptoms were then hurried on with &s;uch precipitation, that the patient generally died before the end of the fifth day, excepting a con&s;iderable cool|ne&s;s of the weather happily intervened; but on the contrary, it was a favourable circum|&s;tance when the fever was protracted to the end of the third day, without any remarkable hardne&s;s or depre&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;e. 5. A great depre&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;e, about the ter|mination of the fever, is bad, &s;ince, from that circum&s;tance, the vomitings, ince&s;&s;ant jactations, the coldne&s;s and lividne&s;s of the extremities, haemorrhagies, <HI>delirium, &amp;c.</HI> are u&s;hered in with &s;urpri&s;ing celerity. 6. The more the &s;trength is pro&s;trated from the fir&s;t attack, the greater is the danger. 7. A vomiting coming on early in the di&s;ea&s;e, and continuing or increa&s;ing, is bad, and generally pre&s;ages the <HI>black vomit.</HI> 8. A &s;ediment in the urine in the fir&s;t and &s;econd day of the di&s;ea&s;e is bad, and the more copious the &s;ediment is, the greater is the danger.</P>

XIV. THE progno&s;tics in the &s;econd <HI>&s;ta|dium</HI> are the&s;e: 1. An early yellowne&s;s in the white of the eyes is bad: when it is ob&s;ervable about the end of the &s;econd day, in the fir&s;t <HI>&s;tadium,</HI> the patient generally dies about the beginning of the fourth day from the fir&s;t attack of the di&s;ea&s;e. But when the yellowne&s;s does not appear till the end of the third day, if the patient does not re|cover, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes continues to the 9th or 10th day of the &s;econd <HI>&s;tadium</HI> before the patient dies. When the yellow|ne&s;s of the &s;kin and eyes increa&s;es fa&s;t and acquires &s;oon a deep icteritious-like colour, the greate&s;t danger is to be apprehended. 2. If the inflammation of the white of the eyes increa&s;es, it is bad. 3. The more in|flamed and bloody-like the &s;kin is where it has been bli&s;tered, the greater is the danger. 4. If the vomiting continues or increa&s;es, it is bad, but the <HI>black vomiting</HI> is generally mortal. 5. When the pul&s;e varies frequently in its fullne&s;s, being &s;ometimes &s;mall, then fuller, it is bad. But there was le&s;s de|pendence to be had on the pul&s;e in this than is common in other di&s;ea&s;es; for in &s;ome patients, in the &s;econd &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e,
<PB N="307" REF="035302_0321_10021A86081D1660">
even within a few hours of their death, the pul&s;e, with re&s;pect to its fullne&s;s, &s;oft|ne&s;s, equality and frequency, has continued like that of one in perfect health, although, from the other &s;ymptoms, the death of the patient could be foretold with great cer|tainty. 6. The more the &s;trength of the patient is reduced in the fir&s;t, the greater is the danger in the &s;econd <HI>&s;tadium.</HI> 7. Great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, inquietude, an early <HI>delirium</HI> and a continuation of it are very bad. 8. Livid blotches about the neck and brea&s;t, a livid|ne&s;s of the lips and nails flu&s;shing of the face, or a livid colour thereof, are &s;ure &s;igns of the quick approach of death. 9. Fre|quent loo&s;e &s;tools, which give not any re|lief are bad, and &s;ooner they &s;ponta|neou&s;ly happen, the greater is the danger: but those which are black, and continue &s;o without any abatement of the &s;ymptoms, are generally mortal. 10. Bloody urine and all haemorrhagies, excepting flight ones from the no&s;e, are bad; and more copious they are, the greater is the danger. But a flux of the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> though not at their regular period, if attended with an abatement of the &s;ymptoms, is a favourable circum&s;tance,
<PB N="308" REF="035302_0322_10021A8966129CD0">
otherwi&s;e it is bad. 11. A &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e, who, in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, have had large di&s;charges that way, is a certain &s;ign of the quick approach of death.</P>
