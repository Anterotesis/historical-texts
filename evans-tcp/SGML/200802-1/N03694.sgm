<P>IT being the plea&s;ure of the All-wi&s;e GOD to &s;uffer War to happen in our Nation at this Day as in gives us all grounds to fear that our Ways have not been Plea&s;ing un|to Him; &s;o if we are &s;en&s;ible o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Danger, it can &s;carcely be imagined, but that we &s;hould be thoughtful &amp; inqui&s;itive what we may be&s;t do to &s;ecure our &s;elves from the inva&s;ions of our Enemies&punc;</P>
<P>And truly at this day, this has been the &s;oli|citous tho't &amp; Enquiry of many in this Govern|ment: And in a time of Danger it is but rea|&s;onable that every one &s;hould have a &s;uitable Concern for his own &amp; others Safety.

They were stoned, they were

&s;awn a&s;under, werr <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">emoted and &s;lain by the Sword; They wandred about in Sheep-skins &amp; Goat-skins, be|ing destitute, afflicted, tormented: They wandred in De&s;erts and Mountains, in Dens and Caves of the Earth.</HI> So that to a carnal Eye, one would be ready to think this Aphori&s;m of <HI>Solomon</HI> to be but a Paradox, and that the Truth lay in the Rever&s;e; and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e had the fewell Enemies and mo&s;t Peace who&s;e ways di&s;plea&s;ed God: As it hath been often found in Experience, That <HI>the tabernacles of Robbers pro&s;per, and that tho&s;e that temp God are &s;ecure.</HI></P>
<P>How then mu&s;t we under&s;tand this &s;aying of <HI>Solomon,</HI> That <HI>when a mans ways plea&s;e the Lord, he will make even his Enemies to be at peace with him?</HI></P>
<P>Now for an <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to this <HI>Objection,</HI> we mu&s;t remember, That God makes a mans Enemies to be at Peace with him in a two-fold &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When he makes them become his Friends:</HI> When tho&s;e that were at Enmity with him and hated him, become Reconciled &amp; cordial Friends to him, to love him &amp; carry it friendly to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God makes a mans Enemies to be at Peace with him, when He protects &amp; &s;ecures him from all harm from them:</HI> So that tho' their Enmity remains and they would de&s;troy him if they could, yet God curbs &amp; re&s;trains their Power, &s;o that <HI>their hands cannot perform their Enterpri&s;e:</HI> And &s;o a man is as &s;ecure from all harm from his Enemies, as if they were at perfect Peace and Amity. In
<PB N="5" REF="004526_0005_100DA16D02024070">
this &s;en&s;e we may under&s;tand that Text, Job 5. 23. <HI>Thou &s;halt be in league with the &s;tones of the field, &amp; the bea&s;ts of the field &s;hall be at peace with thee.</HI> That is, You &s;hall be &s;ecure from harm by them. Now tho' it be true. That when a mans ways plea&s;e the Lord, he doth not always make his Enemies become his Friends, and &s;o at peace with him in that &s;en&s;e; yet He doth al|ways &s;ecure him from all harm from his Ene|mies, whether &s;ecret or open; and doth in his Providence &s;o order the matter, That tho' the Enemies of the godly are &s;omtimes permitted to make a &s;poil and a prey of their E&s;tates, and to de&s;troy their Children &amp; Friends, yea, and &s;omtimes al&s;o to take them Captives &amp; keep them in Slavery, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;omtimes to de&s;troy their Per&s;ons; yet nothing they do or can do to them, &s;hall be for their hurt: And God per|mits them to take nothing from them, but what they may better want than have: For this &s;tands &amp; mu&s;t &s;tand as an everla&s;ting truth, Rom. 8. 28 <HI>All things &s;hall work together for good, to them that love God.</HI> So that in this &s;en&s;e, when a mans ways plea&s;e the Lord, He doth always make his Enemies to be at peace with him: That is, So far as that they &s;hall do him no hurt, but good, whatever their evil intentions may be.</P>
<P>And we may farther take notice, That <HI>So|lomon</HI> here &s;peaks of man in particular, and not of man in general; becau&s;e it might then be
<PB N="6" REF="004526_0006_100DA16F2FFC2248">
ju&s;tly Objected, That &s;uch a thing never was, and probably never would be, that all men &s;hould con&s;pire together to plea&s;e God in their ways; And yet it is &s;o &s;poken of man in parti|cular, that all men in general may be encou|raged to endeavour after it; and every one has rea&s;on to hope for the good of the Promi&s;e if his ways plea&s;e God.</P>
<P>And we may farther ob&s;erve, That <HI>Solomon</HI> here &s;peaks of the Ways of a man plea&s;ing the Lord, rather than of his Heart, becau&s;e the <HI>ways</HI> of man are the be&s;t di&s;covery of his <HI>heart;</HI> and it is but in vain for men to flatter them|&s;elves that they plea&s;e God in their <HI>hearts,</HI> when they di&s;plea&s;e him in their <HI>lives</HI> &amp; <HI>ways.</HI></P>
<P>And the words thus con&s;idered may afford us this</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE,</LABEL>
<HI>That the be&s;t way for men to be Secured from all their Enemies, is to Plea&s;e GOD.</HI></P>
<P>So much <HI>Solomon</HI> here teaches us in this Text, <HI>When a mans ways plea&s;e the Lord, he ma|keth even his Enemies to be at Peace with him.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;peaking to this Doctrine, I &s;hall offer the&s;e Two <HI>Propo&s;itions.</HI> [<HI>I.</HI>] That all men are more or le&s;s &s;ubject &amp; lye expo&s;ed to Enemies. [<HI>II.</HI>] That the be&s;t way for them to be &s;ecured from all their Enemies is to plea&s;e God.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>That all men are more or le&s;s &s;ubject and lye expo&s;ed to Enemies,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004526_0006_100DA16F2FFC2248">
There is no man on this &s;ide Heaven, can ju&s;tly look upon him&s;elf as altogether free &amp; out of danger from his Enemies. Now, as men are made up of two main con&s;tituent parts, Namely, their Souls and their Bodies; &s;o there are two &s;orts of Enemies that all men are more or le&s;s expo&s;ed to, Namely, the Enemies of their Souls &amp; the Enemies of their Bodies.</P>
<P>And under the fir&s;t &s;ort of Enemies may be compri&s;ed <HI>the Devil &amp; his Angels;</HI> even all the powers of Hell &amp; Darkne&s;s, even all tho&s;e A|po&s;tate Angels that kept not their fir&s;t State, but left their own Habitation; who are re&s;er|ved in everla&s;ting chains under darkne&s;s to the <HI>Judgment of the great Day;</HI> who being filled with rage &amp; malice again&s;t God and all that belongs to Him. The&s;e envious &s;pirits being grieved that any of the Sons of men &s;hou'd fill up tho&s;e empty Man&s;ions in glory, which they by Sin have lo&s;t, are therefore continually doing their utmo&s;t to hinder men from happine&s;s. And they are very &s;ubtil and cruel Enemies, and &s;uch as all men have need to watch again&s;t &amp; beware of; as the Apo&s;tle exhorts us, 1 Pet, 5. 8 <HI>Be &s;ober, be vigilant, becau&s;e your adver&s;ary the devil as a roaring lion walks about, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI> And under this head, may al&s;o be comprehended <HI>the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h,</HI> even all Sins which have a tendency to de&s;troy the Souls of men, <HI>the wages of which is death.</HI> And there|fore
<PB N="8" REF="004526_0007_100DA171A10552C8">
the Apo&s;tle for this rea&s;on exhorts men <HI>to ab&s;tain from fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts which war again&s;t the Soul,</HI> 1 Pet 2 11 Yea, and men them&s;elves, &s;o far as they by their Temptations, Per&s;wa|&s;ions &amp; evil Examples, do draw us to Sin, are the Enemies of our Souls</P>
<P>And under the &s;econd &s;ort of Enemies, even the Enemies of our Bodies, may be compre|hended <HI>whatever is Hurtful and De&s;tructive to our Bodies and outward E&s;tate;</HI> Even Men that are Enemies to us in a more &s;ecret or open way; and all things that tend to the hurt and de&s;truction of our Bodies, even all Sickne&s;s &amp; Ca&s;ualties that we are expo&s;ed to in this world, which have a tendency to &s;horten our days &amp; bring us to death. And truly, if there be &s;o many things that may be counted Enemies, what man is there or can there be on Earth that is not &s;ubject to them? And truly, if we look upon our&s;elves &amp; con&s;ider, our &s;tate, we &s;hall &s;ee our &s;elves more or le&s;s expo&s;ed to Enemies.

<P>And to explain this Propo&s;ition, we &s;hall con&s;ider two things.</P>

<ITEM>1. How men are to plea&s;e God. And</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Evidence that this is the be&s;t way for men to be &s;ecured from all their Enemies.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. We &s;hall con&s;ider, <HI>How men are to plea&s;e God</HI> And truly this is a Que&s;tion of very great importance. And it will be the Inquiry of every Soul truly &s;en&s;ible of Sin and of the dreadfulne&s;s of God's Wrath. Thus the Peo|ple of God of old, were very inqui&s;itive how to plea&s;e God: And were ready to offer him any kind of Service, even that which was im|po&s;&s;ible, if they might but plea&s;e him. Mic. 6. 6, 7 <HI>Wherewith &s;hall I come before the Lord and how my &s;elf before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be plea&s;ed with thou&s;ands of rams, or ten thou&s;ands of rivers of oyl? Shall I give my fir&s;t-born for my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the fruit of my body for the &s;in of my &s;oul?</HI> But however, men are naturally at a lo&s;s about the way how to plea&s;e God, yet He hath clearly Revealed it in his Word: As the Lord told his People, afore&s;aid, Mic. 6. 8 <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord thy God require of thee.</HI> And as <HI>Adam</HI> was to plea&s;e God by keeping the Law of his Creation and performing the Covenant of Works, &s;o now this power being lo&s;t by the Fall, and man rendered unable to plea&s;e God by the works of the Law, we mu&s;t now only endeavour to plea&s;e God by direction from the
<PB N="10" REF="004526_0008_100DA1736D6F87E0">
Go&s;pel. Therein the Lord hath &s;hewed us what is good and what he doth require of us in order to plea&s;e him. And particularly,</P>
<P>(1) <HI>If we would plea&s;e God we mu&s;t believe in his Son.</HI> This is the great Command of God in the Go&s;pel, <HI>That we believe in the Name of his Only Begotten Son.</HI> And this is the &s;ummary Condition of the Go&s;pel Covenant. And as the Covenant of Works required us, <HI>To do and live,</HI> &s;o the Covenant of Grace requires us, <HI>To believe &amp; be &s;aved.</HI> And who&s;oever now plea&s;es God, mu&s;t plea&s;e him in his Son: For it is in <HI>Him only</HI> that he is well plea&s;ed with &s;inners, <HI>Mat</HI> 3. 17. And all men out of Chri&s;t, are un|der the Anger of God; for <HI>He is angry with the wicked every day.</HI> Man being fallen and &s;inful, and God being infinitely holy, of purer Eyes than to behold evil and that cannot look upon iniquity, it is impo&s;&s;ible for men to obtain the Favour of God without Faith in his Son, So the Apo&s;tle tells us, Heb 116. That <HI>without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.</HI> This therefore is the only way which God hath found out &amp; reveal'd in the Go&s;pel for men to plea&s;e him, <HI>even to believe in Chri&s;t:</HI> By which we &s;hall obtain the forgivene&s;s of our Sins and an Inheritance a|mong all them that are &s;anctified: And &s;o &s;oon as we are Ju&s;tified by Faith, we have Peace with God thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5 1.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004526_0008_100DA1736D6F87E0">
(2) <HI>The way for men to plea&s;e God, is to Repent &amp; turn from all their Sins.</HI> This is another great go&s;pel Command, Act&punc; 17. 30. <HI>He now commands all men every where to repent.</HI> This Repentance implies the work of God's grace in the thoro' Change of heart and life; which the Apo&s;tle calls. <HI>A turning from darkne&s;s unto light, &amp; from the power of &s;atan unto God,</HI> Act. 26. 18 And this the Go&s;pel doth require of men, in order to the obtaining the Pardon of their Sins and the Favour of God, Act. 3. 19. <HI>Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out.</HI> And in this way God does in his Word give men good a&s;&s;urance of their obtaining his Favour; See I&s;a. 1. 16, 17 <HI>Wa&s;h you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Come now, let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord; though your &s;ins are as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be white as &s;now; though they be red like crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool.</HI> So I&s;a&punc; 557. <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the un|righteous man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord and he will have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI> So Jer. 3 12. <HI>Go and proclaim the&s;e words towards the north, and &s;ay, Return thou back&s;liding I&s;rael, &s;aith the Lord, and I will not cau&s;e mine anger to fall upon you for I am merciful, &s;aith the Lord, and will not keep anger for ever.</HI> So Jer. 31. 20. Upon their Re|pentance God &s;aith, <HI>Is Ephraim my dear &s;on? is
