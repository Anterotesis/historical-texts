<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Sheets are offered to the World as containing the &s;ub&s;tance of a Cour&s;e of Lectures on the Materia Medica, delivered by a celebrated Profe&s;&s;or at Edinburgh. As they are not alledged to be printed by his direction, it may &s;eem nece&s;|&s;ary to lay before the Public the rea&s;ons which in|duced the Editors to this &s;tep, as nothing can be farther from their thoughts than the lea&s;t intention of injuring either the fame or intere&s;t of that Gentleman, for who&s;e mind and abilities they have the highe&s;t admiration and e&s;teem. This is &s;o far the ca&s;e, that they would think them&s;elves extremely happy, if, on a &s;ight of this Work, the learned Author could be induced to favour the world with his improved &s;entiments on this &s;ubject, which could not fail of being a mo&s;t u&s;eful, as well as an ac|ceptable pre&s;ent to the Public. The Editors have no
<PB N="iv" REF="014000_0003_0F92581D05494968">
other motive for making this Work public, than a con|cern to find a Performance, which &s;o far excels in me|thod, copiou&s;ne&s;s of thought, liberality of &s;entiment, and judgment, all that have been before written on the &s;ubject, in danger of being lo&s;t to the world.</P>
<P>Near the end of 1761, and about the time when, by the academical rules of the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, the Lectures on Medical Subjects ought to begin, Dr. Al&s;ton, who was at that time Profe&s;&s;or of the Materia Medica, died. By this unexpected event, the Univer&s;ity would have received an injury, if Dr. Cullen, who was then Profe&s;&s;or of Chemi&s;try, had not voluntarily offered to &s;upply the place of Dr. Al&s;ton, in reading Lectures on the Materia Medica for that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>This was gladly accepted, and the offer was made with greater propriety, as the &s;tudy in which he was then principally engaged as a Profe&s;&s;or, led more directly to this &s;ubject, than any other branch of Phy&s;ic what|ever.</P>
<P>It is obvious to every one's under&s;tanding, how diffi|cult it was for the learned Author to acquit him&s;elf pro|perly in this arduous task. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;|couraging circum&s;tance, our Profe&s;&s;or attempted a plan
<PB N="v" REF="014000_0004_0F92581DE91A1458">

entirely new and original, and executed the &s;ame in a manner which gained univer&s;al approbation. The &s;ub|&s;tance of that Performance is the Work now offered to the Public, which, during an interval of eight years pa&s;t, has been much de&s;ired by the Faculty, and it was long hoped that the learned Author him&s;elf would have been induced to communicate them to the world: But, it is pre&s;umed, that his other avocations and exten&s;ive practice have not afforded him &s;ufficient lei&s;ure for &s;uch an Undertaking.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing Sheets are printed from a correct copy, which has been carefully compared with &s;everal others. If, after all, any inaccuracies in the &s;tyle &s;hould have e&s;caped, they are not, in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, to be imputed to the Author, who&s;e manner of expre&s;&s;ion is as pure and elegant, as the matter he delivers is great and original.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the merit of the Performance &s;tands in need of no eulogium, and the method is too clear to require explanation, e&s;pecially as the original Syllabus is &s;ubjoined, with the blank &s;paces filled up (in <HI>Italics,</HI>) as directed to be done in the Cour&s;e of the Lectures. This is the only material alteration that the Editors have made, and the propriety of this will &s;carcely be que&s;tioned.</P>

<HEAD>Additional PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE EDITORS, in publi&s;hing the&s;e Lectures, hoped they were not doing a thing di&s;agreeable to the Author, but in this they were mi&s;taken, and, &s;oon after the Publication, found he did not approve of it; he complained that the Work was by no means &s;ufficiently perfect to do him honour; he &s;aid it was originally im|perfect, having been unexpectedly undertaken, and nece&s;|&s;arily executed in great hurry; and it was &s;till more im|perfect from the inaccuracy of the Gentlemen who had taken the&s;e Notes of the Lectures. In &s;hort, the Doctor &s;aw all this in &s;o &s;trong a light, that, as &s;oon as he was informed of the Publication, he applied for, and obtained from the Lord Chancellor, an Injunction, prohibiting the Sale of the Book. Upon this occa&s;ion the Editors, who never meant to do any thing di&s;agreeable to the Author, applied to him&s;elf for leave to renew the &s;ale. The &s;ame rea&s;ons, however, which made him di&s;approve of the fir&s;t publication, made him very unwilling to admit of it again; but finding that many copies of the book had been di&s;|per&s;ed before the Injunction was &s;erved, being at the &s;ame time per&s;uaded of the innocent intentions of the Editors, and &s;olicited by &s;everal of his Friends, he has at length

This condition the Editors have now complied with as well as they can, and have received from &s;everal Manu&s;cripts &s;uch improvements as occa&s;ioned the re|printing of the fir&s;t &s;heet, and enabled them to give many corrections in other parts of the Work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole of the European Editor's EMENDANDA, which they in&s;erted at the end, is carefully in&s;erted at each proper place, throughout the body of the Work, in this American Edition.</NOTE>. They hope they have done enough to &s;hew what might be expected from the accuracy of the Author's own hand put to &s;uch a Work, and for which they would have willingly waited, but they are a&s;&s;ured by him&s;elf, that his other occupati|ons, and time of life, make it very probable that he never will engage in it.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURES ON THE MATERIA MEDICA, 1761.</HEAD>
<P>A Knowledge of the Materia Medica comprehends a know|ledge of all the &s;ub&s;tances employed in preventing or cu|ring di&s;ea&s;es, and therefore of all tho&s;e employed either in diet or medicine. Different authors have followed different methods in delivering the knowledge of this part of &s;cience, all of them lia|ble to objections, which need not be here pointed out. I &s;hall &s;hew you the plan which I intend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ollow; and, if you &s;hall be con|vinced of the propriety of this, you will ea&s;ily &s;ee the faults of o|thers. Mo&s;t of the &s;ubjects will be con&s;idered under four different heads.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t, The knowledge of the &s;ubject in it&s;elf, and the di&s;tinction of it from every other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d, Its virtues in diet or in medicine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d, The foundation of the&s;e virtues, &s;o far as it can be perceived in the &s;en&s;ible or chemical qualities of the &s;ubject.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th, Its pharmaceutical treatment, and other circum&s;tances nece&s;|&s;ary to its application in medicine or diet.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>With re&s;pect to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> head. The &s;ubjects are of two kinds, as immediately produced by nature, or as farther prepared by art. The knowledge of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is to be got by the &s;tudy of Natural Hi&s;tory; the knowledge of the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> by an acquaintance with the arts which have been employed on them. Under the <HI>&s;econd</HI> head, the virtues &s;hall be delivered, fir&s;t, according to the &s;everal general indica|tions, and then as more e&s;pecially applicable to particular di&s;ea&s;es. Here we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that there is no very good foundation for many
<PB N="2" REF="014000_0008_0F925820CC575510">
of the virtues which are a&s;cribed to medicines by the writers on the Ma|teria Medica. The doctrine of Signatures, the fancies of A&s;trology, and the mi&s;taken application of Chemi&s;try, have very much corrupted this part of &s;cience. Even what is pretended to be drawn from experience, as much of it has proceeded from the errors and prejudices of the ignorant, and much from the fal&s;ehood of de&s;igning men, it is very little to be tru&s;ted. The writers, however, on this &s;ubject, have commonly copied from one another; but I hope I &s;hall be par|doned if I do not repeat after them; and indeed I &s;hall willingly ap|pear rather <HI>pauca &s;cire, quam multa opinari.</HI> Under the <HI>third</HI> head, we &s;hall find &s;till more uncertainty. The &s;en&s;ible qualities of &s;ub&s;tan|ces go but a little way towards di&s;covering their medical virtues. The <HI>Colour</HI> is a very uncertain guide; the <HI>Smell</HI> goes but a little farther; and it is the <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> only that is of any exten&s;ive application. Sir John Floyer, in his <HI>Phytoba&s;anos,</HI> was the fir&s;t who pro&s;ecuted this &s;tudy to any length; and the indu&s;trious Linnaeus has &s;ince be|&s;towed &s;ome attention upon it; but both of them, in &s;training to form a &s;y&s;tem, have carried the matter too far. The Chemical A|naly&s;is, &s;trictly &s;o called, has been found of very little u&s;e; but the treatment, by the application of different men&s;truums, has been of more &s;ervice, and, by re&s;olving vegetables into their gummy or re|&s;inous parts, we have been able &s;ometimes to &s;eparate the &s;alutary from the pernicious, and the efficacious from the inert parts of ma|ny &s;ub&s;tances. Under the <HI>fourth</HI> head, we &s;hall mention the phar|maceutical treatment which medicines have commonly, or may pro|perly receive, and, therefore, the &s;everal compo&s;itions they enter in|to, with &s;ome other particulars relative to their admini&s;tration in diet or medicine.</P>
<P>Of the &s;everal plans of a Materia Medica, that to be found in the treati&s;e <HI>De viribus Medicamentorum,</HI> imputed to the celebrated Dr Boerhaave, appears to be one of the be&s;t. It treats of the &s;everal &s;ub|jects as they occur in the order of the <HI>Methodus Medendi;</HI> and it has premi&s;ed &s;ome phy&s;iological doctrines that are nece&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to the whole. I find it nece&s;&s;ary to follow this part of the plan, e&s;pecially, as I have &s;ome peculiar notions on the &s;ubject, which, as they are not common in our &s;chools, it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to ex|plain.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, we adopt the propo&s;ition very well e&s;tabli&s;hed, <HI>Medicamentum non agit in Cadaver:</HI> That is to &s;ay, That the opera|tion
<PB N="3" REF="014000_0009_0F92582581FBA508">
of medicines does not depend on the laws of matter and mo|tion, which take place in inanimate bodies, but on a principle which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in living animals only. We inquire therefore after this vital principle. It mu&s;t be connected with the primary and fundamen|tal functions of the animal oeconomy; but the functions of the ani|mal oeconomy are mutually &s;o much the cau&s;es and effects of each other, and run &s;o much in a circle, that it is difficult to chu&s;e where to begin. Many think the circulation of the blood may be con&s;i|dered as the vital principle upon which all the other functions de|pend; but we mu&s;t trace this to its cau&s;e in the action of the heart; and this again manife&s;tly depends upon a certain power acting in or upon the mu&s;cular fibres of this organ. When we con&s;ider this power, we find it belongs, in common with tho&s;e of the heart, to e|very mu&s;cular fibre in the whole body. At the &s;ame time, we find, that the power of mu&s;cular fibres every where depends upon the nerves; that the&s;e nerves, for what power they communicate, depend upon their connection with their common origin in the brain and <HI>me|dulla &s;pinalis;</HI> the nerves and mu&s;cular fibres therefore form a &s;y&s;tem, who&s;e functions may be con&s;idered as primary and fundamental in the animal oeconomy. The principal part of this nervous &s;y&s;tem is manife&s;tly the common origin, which is properly enough con&s;idered as the <HI>&s;en&s;orium commune,</HI> as the more immediate organ of the &s;oul. It is therefore with probability &s;uppo&s;ed, that our intellectual part, or the &s;oul, is the vital principle of the animal oeconomy. With regard to this, there is &s;ome difference of opinion, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to influence the &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;ic, and particularly the que&s;tion, Whether our intellectual part depends on a certain con&s;titution of matter, or upon an immaterial &s;ub&s;tance connected with our mate|rial part? We are of the latter opinion, and think it is fully proved, by ob&s;erving, that there are laws of the animal oeconomy ab&s;olutely incompatible with the ordinary powers of matter and motion. But, on this &s;ubject, I refer you entirely to Dr Whytt, who, in his book on the vital and involuntary motions of animals, has put the mat|ter beyond all doubt. I will add only one argument, which is, That the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, a very fundamental part of all our intellec|tual operations, cannot be explained upon any &s;uppo&s;ed organiza|tion of matter. There is indeed &s;omething analogous to it in &s;ound|ing &s;trings, that are in a certain proportion to one another; but, if the &s;imultaneous motions of our intellectual part depended on &s;uch a mechani&s;m, we &s;hould find, that the&s;e &s;imultaneous motions would
<PB N="4" REF="014000_0010_0F92582758AEBDA8">
be confined to certain parts, and take place in the&s;e only; but, of the motions of living animals, any one may be a&s;&s;ociated with any o|ther; and the a&s;&s;ociation depends entirely upon the impre&s;&s;ions pro|ducing them being made, and frequently repeated, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of a <HI>Soul</HI> admitted, we mu&s;t next inquire into the circum&s;tances of its operating in the &s;y&s;tem. With re&s;pect to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, we find, That the notion of the &s;oul's governing the whole animal functions is very ancient, as we meet with it in the Timaeus of Plato. It has &s;ince been revived in different &s;hapes by Helmont, Wepfer, and Dolaeus, and e&s;pecially by Stahl, who plainly main|tains, that the &s;oul, as in a great mea&s;ure independent of the body, and as in it&s;elf a rational being, pre&s;ides over and directs mo&s;t of the animal functions. In this he has been followed by many phy|&s;icians in Germany, by Dr Nichols in England, as appears from his di&s;&s;ertation, intitled <HI>Anima Medica;</HI> and our countryman Dr Por|terfield has al&s;o &s;hewn a &s;trong bias to the &s;ame opinion. We can|not, however, join in this with the&s;e re&s;pectable per&s;ons, as we nei|ther find it founded in truth, nor that it can have any good in|fluence on the &s;y&s;tem or practice of phy&s;ic. Although the &s;oul is certainly a di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;tance from the body, it appears highly pro|bable, that the &s;oul, while connected w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> the body, &s;eldom acts, but it con&s;equence of motions fir&s;t excited in the latter; and that it is ge|nerally true, that <HI>Nihil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t in intellectu, quod non prius fuerat in &s;en|&s;u.</HI> Even our reflex &s;en&s;ations &s;eem to depend upon certain condi|tions of the organ of our intellectual functions; and the&s;e conditions being given, the reflex &s;en&s;ations are always nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. The impo&s;&s;ibility of a perpetual motion or au|tomaton being demon&s;trated with re&s;pect to matter, this is con&s;i|dered as a proof, that the &s;eeming automaton in a living animal mu&s;t depend upon a &s;oul animating all its motions. That the &s;oul is con&s;tant|ly nece&s;&s;ary to the motions of the body, we readily admit; but the ar|gument is pu&s;hed too far, when it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e motions are &s;upported by the power of the &s;oul alone; for, it appears, that motions excited by the impul&s;e of external bodies, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to that &s;upport. Take away all impre&s;&s;ions on the external &s;en&s;es, and mo&s;t per&s;ons will fall a&s;leep, and that &s;leep would probably continue and end in death, were it not for impre&s;&s;ions being renewed. The power of the &s;oul appears, e&s;pecially in what are called the voluntary motions; but the&s;e, properly con&s;idered, do not &s;hew that power exerted in
<PB N="5" REF="014000_0011_0F92582792DF5450">
an arbitrary manner, or with any attention to the motions of the body. How the Will is determined in all ca&s;es, we do not &s;ay; but, however determined, it is merely the conception of an end or pur|po&s;e to be executed; and, with this, certain motions of the body are nece&s;&s;arily connected, without the &s;oul's being con&s;cious, in ma|ny ca&s;es, even of the motions of the limbs produced, and in no ca&s;e of the action of the mu&s;cles which produces the&s;e motions. Anger makes me Will to give a blow; I make a full in&s;piration; I conti|nue it; I bend back my body; I lift up my arm, and &s;tretch it to the utmo&s;t; I clo&s;e my fi&s;t, and bring down my arm with force upon the part I would &s;trike; and, with all this, my limbs are &s;et in a particular po&s;ition, my eye-brows are knit, my eyes are fixed, and the features of the face are &s;et in a particular manner. Of the&s;e &s;e|veral motions, the &s;oul is very little con&s;cious, and not at all of the &s;everal mu&s;cles employed. The &s;oul is indeed a nece&s;&s;ary part of the&s;e motions, but cannot be &s;aid to direct and govern them inde|pendent of the conditions of the body. This is &s;till more clear with re&s;pect to the internal, and what are called Involuntary Motions, with which phy&s;ic is more e&s;pecially concerned. The Stahlians would have us believe, that the increa&s;ed action of the heart and arteries which appears in fevers, does not ari&s;e from the phy&s;ical power of the cau&s;e of fevers, but from hence, that the &s;oul, percei|ving the noxious tendency of &s;ome matter pre&s;ent in the &s;y&s;tem, ex|cites the action of the heart and arteries as a means of expelling &s;uch noxious matter. This cannot be proved; and it appears to us more probable, that, analogous to a general law of the &s;y&s;tem, the material cau&s;e of fevers has a phy&s;ical power of exciting tho&s;e mo|tions that are fitted to expel it out of the body. In &s;hort, whatever &s;hare the &s;oul may have in &s;upporting the motions of the body, we can have no art of phy&s;ic, but in &s;o far as we &s;uppo&s;e, that the cau&s;es operating upon the body act by a phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity; and that, by a knowledge of &s;uch cau&s;es, we can produce certain changes in the &s;tate of the matter and organization of the body. We agree therefore with Dr Boerhaave, that, when a medical pro|blem is pro&s;ecuted &s;o far as to be carried to circum&s;tances depending upon the connection between the &s;oul and body, it may be con&s;ider|ed as &s;olved for all the purpo&s;es of phy&s;ic. Upon the whole, there|fore, we conclude with the &s;ame celebrated phy&s;ician, that the con|&s;ideration of the &s;oul is not nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;ic; In&s;t.
<PB N="6" REF="014000_0012_0F92582A1E4849F0">
Med. Art. 696. And, laying a&s;ide the doctrine of the Stahlians, we return to con&s;ider the animal oeconomy under another view.</P>
<P>We have hinted already, that the functions of the <HI>&s;en&s;orium com|mune</HI> are fundamental in the &s;y&s;tem. It is connected with the ex|tremities of the nerves every where, &s;o that, by an impre&s;&s;ion made upon certain of the&s;e extremities, a motion is propagated from thence to the &s;en&s;orium; in con&s;equence of which, a &s;en&s;ation ari&s;es; and, by &s;en&s;ations ari&s;ing in the &s;en&s;orium, a motion is propaga|ted from thence to certain extremities connected with mu&s;cular fi|bres, whereby the&s;e are excited to contraction. Tho&s;e parts of the body upon which impre&s;&s;ions made give occa&s;ion to &s;en&s;ation, are &s;aid to be &s;en&s;ible; and tho&s;e parts which are excited to motion by impre&s;&s;ions made upon them, or upon the &s;en&s;orium, are &s;aid to be irritable. Now, it is pretty obvious, that mo&s;t of the motions of the body depend upon the action of irritable parts; and as in many ca&s;es the action of the&s;e parts is only excited in con&s;equence of &s;en|&s;ations, or other powers acting on the &s;en&s;orium, it is plain, that mo&s;t of the functions of the body depend upon a communication of motion by means of the nerves. This may be called the Nervous Power; and its nature has been variou&s;ly judged of. It is perhaps not very nece&s;&s;ary to determine it; but we &s;hall venture to &s;ay, that it is pro|bably a &s;ubtile ela&s;tic fluid inherent in the whole medullary fibres of the nervous &s;y&s;tem; and that this is probably the material vital principle of animals. Somewhat analogous to it appears in ve|getables, many of which are manife&s;tly endowed with irritability. Perhaps it is common to all nature, and only under different modi|fications by certain conditions of other matter.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ibility and irritability of the &s;y&s;tem, as depending upon a nervous power, being in general e&s;tabli&s;hed, it is of importance to determine, what parts are more e&s;pecially endowed with the&s;e properties. Irritability is evident wherever we can di&s;tinctly ob&s;erve the pre&s;ence of mu&s;cular fibres, as in the organs of voluntary motion, in the heart, the bronchiae, and alimentary canal; and in &s;ome parts, where the mu&s;cular &s;tructure is not quite evident, experiment has &s;hown the irritability, as in the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, and in mo&s;t of the excretories. The irritability of the&s;e la&s;t appears in every ex|cretion, that of &s;weat excepted; for this &s;eems e&s;pecially, or only, promoted by the increa&s;ed action of the heart, while every other is
<PB N="7" REF="014000_0013_0F92582A8D67BB70">
by an irritation applied to the excretories them&s;elves; and not only by applications to the excretories, but al&s;o by tho&s;e applied to other parts having a &s;ympathy with particular glands: Thus, certain &s;ounds can occa&s;ion an increa&s;ed excretion of &s;aliva, and a fractured &s;cull increa&s;es the evacuation of bile. The important que&s;tion on this &s;ubject is, Whether the arteries are endowed with irritability? It is alledged by &s;ome anatomi&s;ts, that what has been called the mu&s;|cular coat of the arteries con&s;i&s;ts only of fibres, &s;uch as are in the tendons or ligaments, and which are no where el&s;e &s;en&s;ible or irri|table; that, in experiment, the arteries do not appear irrit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">e by mechanical &s;timuli; and though they appear to contract upon the application of &s;trong acids, this is no more than what happens to the veins, and even to the fibres of dead animals. But, on the o|ther hand, it is &s;aid, that, if the arteries are &s;imple ela&s;tics, the &s;tate of the circulation in every part of the body mu&s;t, for the mo&s;t part, depend upon the action of the heart alone; and, if the im|petus of the blood be increa&s;ed in one part only, while the action of the heart continues the &s;ame, it will be difficult to account for it upon that &s;uppo&s;ition. Thus, in blu&s;hing, the impetus of the blood is increa&s;ed in the ve&s;&s;els of the face, and in tho&s;e of the cheeks more particularly. Now if this depended upon the increa&s;ed action of the heart, the redne&s;s produced &s;hould appear over the whole &s;urface of the body; and, if it depended on certain circum|&s;tances in the &s;tate of the re&s;piration, the effect &s;hould appear e|qually over the whole &s;uperior parts; but neither of the&s;e happen; the effects are truly partial, and they are only to be accounted for by &s;uppo&s;ing, that the arteries are endowed with irritability and a mu&s;cular power, which can be increa&s;ed in particular parts of them, while the action of the heart and other arteries continue the &s;ame as before. Dr Haller endeavoured formerly to account for the&s;e inequalities in the &s;tate of the circulation, by the contraction of the nerves &s;urrounding &s;everal arteries; but, perceiving that truly the nerves are endued with no contractility, he has entirely given up that theory.</P>
<P>Having thus pointed out the extent of irritability, and of the ef|fects of a nervous power in the &s;y&s;tem, it is evident, that the laws by which the action of the nervous power is regulated require to be attended to, and &s;tudied more carefully than hitherto they have been. We &s;hall not attempt to &s;upply this at pre&s;ent; but &s;hall en|deavour to do &s;omewhat, as particular &s;ubjects may give occa&s;ion to
<PB N="8" REF="014000_0014_0F92582B505CD7C0">
it. Ju&s;t now we &s;hall only make &s;ome general application of what has been &s;aid. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> With regard to the &s;olids of the body, the &s;tate of laxity or rigidity in the &s;imple &s;olids has had a great &s;hare in our modern pathology; and we think that the con&s;ideration is not to be neglected altogether; but, at the &s;ame time, think, that the laxity or rigidity of the &s;imple &s;olids being given, it is not rea|dily or occa&s;ionally changed; and that all &s;udden and occa&s;ional changes in debility or &s;trength, contractility or flaccidity, are more probably referred to the &s;tate of the moving fibres under the influ|ence of the nervous power: <HI>Quam facile mille res turbant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Every change in the &s;tate of the fluids poured out, has been con&s;idered as depending upon the &s;tate of the fluids in the ve&s;|&s;els; and it may be &s;o in &s;ome ca&s;es. But, as it is probable that the &s;ecreted fluids are chiefly formed in the &s;ecretory organs, &s;o it is cer|tain, that the &s;tate of the &s;ecreted fluids is changed by the relaxa|tion or con&s;triction of the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els; and, therefore, the fluids poured out are more frequently a mark of the &s;tate of the moving powers than of the general condition of the fluids. Thus, the u|rine, which has been &s;o long con&s;idered as a mark of the &s;tate of the circulating fluids, is however, for the mo&s;t part, no other than a mark of the &s;tate of the &s;ecretory organ.</P>
<P>The <HI>third,</HI> and only other application we &s;hall make of the con|&s;ideration of the influence of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, is to ob&s;erve, that, as the whole of the &s;en&s;ible and irritable parts have a connec|tion with the &s;en&s;orium, &s;o certain parts have a more particular con|nection with certain others. This connection, &s;ympathy, or con&s;ent, has been often taken notice of; but not &s;o accurately and fully as is to be wi&s;hed. At pre&s;ent I &s;hall mention only one in&s;tance, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that of the &s;tomach, as it is to be more particularly regarded in account|ing for the operation of medicines. Nothing affects the mind more than the &s;tate of the &s;tomach, and nothing draws the &s;tomach into &s;ympathy more than affections of the mind. This is evident in hypochondriac people, who&s;e di&s;ea&s;e being chiefly &s;eated there, has often grievous effects on the <HI>&s;en&s;orium commune,</HI> or the &s;eat of it, the head. This is farther illu&s;trated by wounds of the head. Does not, in the&s;e ca&s;es, the vomiting of bile proceed from con&s;ent between the &s;tomach and liver? 2dly, The &s;tomach has a con&s;iderable con|nection with the vi&s;cera of the thorax, ab&s;tracting from its contiguity or di&s;tention. In hypochondriac ca&s;es, the heart and lungs are often
<PB N="9" REF="014000_0015_0F92582C0D7EA6A0">
variou&s;ly affected by the &s;tomach. Convul&s;ions of the diaphragm are often occa&s;ioned by &s;light irritations of the cardia. Many other morbid &s;ymptoms might be adduced in proof of the &s;ame thing, were it nece&s;&s;ary. 3dly, The &s;tomach is connected with the ab|dominal vi&s;cera, and fir&s;t with the inte&s;tines; &s;econdly, with the other contiguous as well as more di&s;tant organs. 4thly, This vi&s;cus is connected with the extremities. This I have often experienced in my&s;elf, by tran&s;ition of the gout, from the feet to the &s;tomach, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Cold and heat likewi&s;e applied to the extremities, affect the &s;tomach. 5thly, It is connected with the whole &s;urface of the body, and &s;eemingly with the extreme ve&s;&s;els every where. This is demon&s;trable by many ob&s;ervations; <HI>e. g.</HI> no &s;ooner do &s;ome aliments reach the &s;tomach of <HI>particular</HI> per&s;ons, than &s;pots and efflore&s;cences are occa&s;ioned on the &s;kin. Van Swieten gives &s;uch an in&s;tance from crabs eyes. I my&s;elf had a patient labouring under the <HI>malum hypochondriacum,</HI> who was relieved of his complaints by pimples appearing between his thumb and finger, and as immediately <HI>op|pre&s;&s;ed</HI> by their retropul&s;ion, or di&s;appearing. Vomiting from con|&s;triction of the cutaneous pores is another in&s;tance of &s;uch &s;ympathy. Such &s;ymptoms, therefore, are fal&s;ly attributed to acrimony; and in general we conclude, that the &s;tomach has a very general con&s;ent with the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Operation of medicines depends &s;omewhat on their own nature, but as much on the particular modification of the &s;y&s;tem to which they are applied. In&s;tead, therefore, of &s;pending time, in examin|ing the different <HI>figure</HI> of the particles of medicine, their &s;harpne&s;s, oilyne&s;s, &amp;c. it will be more u&s;eful to &s;ay &s;omewhat on tempera|ments. Temperament is the general &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem; idio&s;yn|cracy the <HI>peculiar</HI> &s;tate of a <HI>particular</HI> part. The variety of tempe|raments is prodigious. The ancients have confined them to four, and we, through a blind attachment to antiquity, have made few farther advancements in this di&s;tinction. It would be difficult to enumerate all the different temperaments; I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider, rather, the &s;everal particulars in the &s;y&s;tem that are apt to be varied in
<PB N="10" REF="014000_0016_0F92582CC136E9C0">
different con&s;titutions, and who&s;e varieties con&s;titute diver&s;ity of temperaments. The&s;e particulars may be reduced to five. 1. The &s;tate of the &s;imple &s;olids. 2. The proportion of the fluids to the &s;olids. 3. The &s;tate of the fluids. 4. The di&s;tribution of the fluids: <HI>i. e.</HI> of particular determination to this or that part of the &s;y&s;tem. 5. The &s;tate of the nervous power.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the &s;tate of the <HI>&s;imple &s;olids,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> their laxity, or rigidity. Under the fir&s;t is comprehended flaccidity, and debility; under the la&s;t ela&s;ticity, and &s;trength. It may be doubted, whether the&s;e &s;hould be taken in here, as they are variable in every per&s;on, and, through the whole cour&s;e of life, growing gradually from lax to rigid, as age encrea&s;es, and therefore might be &s;uppo&s;ed not to affect tempera|ments. Something, however, depends on the primitive &s;tamina, in the formation of temperaments; <HI>e. g.</HI> two children, born at the &s;ame time, brought up exactly under the &s;ame management, will differ very con&s;iderably, as to the &s;tate of their &s;imple fibres.</P>
<P>Univer&s;ally, Phy&s;icians have taken their mark of the &s;tate of the &s;imple &s;olids from the hair. In a ca&s;e of laxity the hair is &s;oft, and in &s;mall quantity. In ca&s;e of rigidity, it is copious, and liable to cri&s;pature and curling. The paler colours are, in general, an indi|cation of laxity; as the black, in all its &s;hades, is an evidence of rigi|dity. Thus, in children, the hair is generally &s;oft and pale, and gains, by age, hardne&s;s, and a darker colour. Another mark of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing the nature of the &s;imple fibres, is the &s;oftne&s;s and hardne&s;s of the fle&s;hy parts. When the body is fle&s;hy, and the mu&s;cles and tendons di&s;tinctly <HI>marked,</HI> and along with this a con&s;iderable <HI>&s;trength of &s;y&s;tem,</HI> we infer a rigidity of the &s;imple fibres, with a con&s;iderable exertion of the nervous power. Succulency, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, mu&s;t be a &s;ymptom of laxity.</P>
<P N="2">2. The proportion <HI>between &s;olids</HI> and <HI>fluids.</HI> There has been no|thing &s;o much talked of as plethora, and yet it has been commonly confounded with <HI>obe&s;ity</HI> and corpulency. There is, however, a ma|nife&s;t <HI>difference,</HI> though difficultly di&s;tingui&s;hed by particular marks,
<PB N="11" REF="014000_0017_0F92582D9639DD78">
and at the &s;ame time a connection. Plethora implies a greater quantity of fluids <HI>circulating</HI> in the ve&s;&s;els, di&s;tingui&s;hable by ruddi|ne&s;s of colour, and a number of veins di&s;tended over the body. Of obe&s;ity, the greater proportion of it <HI>lies without the laws of circulation.</HI> Obe&s;ity may cau&s;e plethora; as in obe&s;ity, though a greater quantity is &s;ecreted, it is not let off from the body, and may therefore pre&s;s upon the ve&s;&s;els and cau&s;e plethora.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The &s;tate of the fluids.</HI> The&s;e, in my opinion, might be di&s;|regarded, as they depend on the &s;tate of the &s;olids and the nouri&s;h|ment. But we mu&s;t not di&s;regard what the Ancients have a&s;&s;igned as the cau&s;e of the different temperaments, which they made to de|pend on four different humours. This doctrine, however, of the Ancients, is now almo&s;t entirely neglected. The Chemi&s;ts have delivered nothing clear or preci&s;e on this head, from the different proportions of oil, earth, &s;alt, &amp;c. in the blood. They have even added mercury and iron, as the latter is found in all human blood. But we are not a&s;&s;ured of other principles, be&s;ides tho&s;e of red globules, coagulable lymph, and &s;ero&s;ity, which la&s;t is water impreg|nated with a &s;aline principle. The&s;e, I make no doubt, are in dif|ferent proportions, from the nature of the aliment or di&s;ea&s;es. But I do not know how to make u&s;e of this, at lea&s;t till we be more fully acquainted with the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>proportions</HI> of the&s;e, and the proper methods of di&s;tingui&s;hing them, which are at pre&s;ent very inaccurate and imperfect; <HI>e. g.</HI> the proportion of red globules is not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, as the <HI>le&s;s</HI> or <HI>more florid colour of the whole</HI> depends not on their quantity, but on the &s;tate of diffu&s;ion. Again, the proportion of coagulable lymph is not even evident from <HI>con&s;i&s;tence</HI> as in per|&s;ons where there is the &s;ame quantity of &s;erum, the con&s;i&s;tence is different. Ligature on the ve&s;&s;els, child-bearing, &amp;c. cau&s;e a dif|ferent degree of &s;eparation of coagulable lymph, &amp;c. &s;o that no per&s;on can make any accurate judgment from appearance of the blood. Den&s;ity is a more certain mark. The blood is den&s;er in proportion to rigidity of the ve&s;&s;els, and in the &s;ame &s;pecies in pro|portion to the age; <HI>e. g.</HI> it is more den&s;e in cows than calves, &amp;c.
<PB N="12" REF="014000_0018_0F92582E41DDD820">
The <HI>quantity</HI> of &s;aline matter may al&s;o affect the den&s;ity of the blood, and therefore we cannot po&s;itively determine whether the fluidity of the blood, in particular ca&s;es, be owing entirely to the abundance of a pure watery part, as &s;aline matter may contribute con&s;iderably towards the production of that quality.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Di&s;tribution of the fluids.</HI> This is different in the &s;ame per|&s;on, according to his age, owing to a difference in the &s;tructure and di&s;tribution of the ve&s;&s;els. It &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary that the brain &s;hould be brought to its &s;ize quickly; hence the head in a foetus is much greater in proportion to the other parts, and then con&s;titutes one-fifth of the whole; whereas in an adult it does not exceed one-ninth, and, frequently, one-tenth only. After birth, a new deter|mination is given to the circulating fluids; the circulation being &s;topt in the umbilical ve&s;&s;els, is determined to the iliacs, and hence the growth afterwards of the lower extremities is more remarkable. This accounts for haemorrhages, &amp;c. which happen in different parts of the body, at different periods of life, <HI>e. g.</HI> bleeding of the no&s;e in young per&s;ons. Again, if a tall per&s;on have not hands and feet proportionate to the length of his body, he is liable to di&s;ea&s;es. Thus I have &s;een a <HI>phthi&s;is pulmonalis,</HI> of which this di&s;proportion was the mo&s;t probable cau&s;e. Hence if we could a&s;certain the pro|portions of the human body exactly, we might form a notion how di&s;ea&s;es might ari&s;e according to the various deviations from it.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now take notice of the different di&s;tribution into the arterious and venous &s;y&s;tems. The arteries are larger in proportion to the veins in the young than in old &s;ubjects. Wintringham, jun. finds the den&s;ity of the arterious coats in proportion to tho&s;e of the veins le&s;s in young than in old animals. The arteries, therefore, from being laxer, grow more rigid, and are laxer as nearer to the heart. All this is wi&s;ely ordered; for the arteries being more ex|po&s;ed to the <HI>action</HI> of the heart, and the fluids, in their moving from a greater to a le&s;&s;er diameter, are &s;ooner rendered rigid, than the veins, in which the power of the heart is weaker, and the fluids
<PB N="13" REF="014000_0019_0F92582F582021D8">
move in a contrary manner. Hence ari&s;es in young per&s;ons the <HI>arterious,</HI> in old the <HI>venous plethora,</HI> a di&s;tinction commonly unob&s;erv|ed, though it gives a con&s;iderable difference in point of temperament. Arterious plenitude is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the florid complexion, the venous by di&s;ten&s;ion of veins and palene&s;s of the body. This change of plenitude is gradually taking place in all people, though the degree of it is con&s;iderably varied in different per&s;ons.</P>
<P>We con&s;ider here, very properly, the proportional capacity and force of the heart in regard to the &s;y&s;tem, at different times of life, as al&s;o the proportion of the lungs to the re&s;t of the body: For as the &s;ame quantity of fluids, in a given time, pa&s;&s;es through them, as through the <HI>whole body,</HI> any large proportion of fluids in the &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be very &s;en&s;ibly felt <HI>there,</HI> and, con&s;equently, have an effect in the production of temperament. Thus narrow che&s;ted people are more &s;ubject than others to haemopto&euml; and conge&s;tion in the lungs.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Different &s;tate of the nervous power,</HI> with regard to &s;en&s;ibility, irritability, mobility, and &s;trength. By &s;en&s;ibility we mean the fitne&s;s for having &s;en&s;ation excited by external impre&s;&s;ion; and as different forces of impre&s;&s;ion are nece&s;&s;ary to move different per&s;ons, the &s;en&s;ibility is greater, as the le&s;s force of impre&s;&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;en&s;ation. By irritability, we mean the fitne&s;s for having motions excited in con&s;equence of &s;en&s;ation, or other cau&s;es; and this appears different, not only with re&s;pect to the degree of force in the cau&s;e, but with re&s;pect to the extent of the effects in the &s;y&s;tem. Thus, of two per&s;ons, not only one will be vomited by a much &s;maller quantity of an emetic than the other, but al&s;o two per&s;ons taking the &s;ame do&s;e will be very differently affected, while, in the one, the effects will be confined to the &s;tomach, and the parts nece&s;&s;arily connected with it in vomiting, and, in the other, the effects will be extended &s;o as to produce convul&s;ions over the whole body. Of the difference of &s;en&s;ibility we are able to judge but gro&s;sly, as it does not always depend on the degree of force in impre&s;&s;ion, but in this
<PB N="14" REF="014000_0020_0F9258300BC2AA78">
re&s;pect is greatly changeable by cu&s;tom and practice. This is par|ticularly to be ob&s;erved, that there is a great difference between the &s;en&s;ibility to a &s;ingle impre&s;&s;ion, and the &s;en&s;ibility to the difference of force in the &s;ame &s;pecies of impre&s;&s;ions, or to the difference of impre&s;&s;ions nearly akin to one another. Thus, there may be two per&s;ons equally &s;en&s;ible to the &s;malle&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of any &s;apid body on the tongue; but, while the one may be able to di&s;tingui&s;h only green from bohea tea in infu&s;ion, and hardly any difference in the qualities of each, the other &s;hall be able to di&s;tingui&s;h not only many different degrees in the qualities of either &s;pecies, but al&s;o, in the ca&s;e of their mixture, be able to di&s;cern the proportion in which they are mixed together. The &s;ame difference of &s;en&s;ibility occurs more frequently &s;till with re&s;pect to &s;ound. A per&s;on may be exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible to the &s;ofte&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of &s;ound, but, at the &s;ame time, may be very little &s;en&s;ible to any difference of tones. Irritability mu&s;t commonly be connected with &s;en&s;ibility; for, as motion de|pends upon &s;en&s;ation, that, therefore, will be generally in proportion to this: But they are not ab&s;olutely connected; for, independent of the nervous power in the brain, the &s;ubject of &s;en&s;ations, irritability is often varied by the greater or le&s;&s;er ten&s;ion, and perhaps other circum&s;tances, of the moving fibres them&s;elves. Both &s;en&s;ibility and irritability are often connected with the weakne&s;s of the nervous power, never remarkably with its &s;trength.</P>
<P>Another particular in which the &s;tate of the nervous power may be different, is mobility, that is, the facility and readine&s;s with which not only motions are in general excited, but e&s;pecially that al&s;o with which different motions &s;ucceed one another. In the fir&s;t re&s;pect, mobility is the &s;ame with irritability; but, in the la&s;t, it is &s;omewhat different. It is obvious, that the nervous power or &s;en&s;o|rium, is more tenacious of impre&s;&s;ions in one per&s;on than in another; and the change, therefore, from one motion to another, will, in &s;uch per&s;ons, be in the &s;ame proportion; which amounts to this, that there is a difference of mobility in the nervous power of different per&s;ons. However, we ob&s;erve that this mobility is commonly
<PB N="15" REF="014000_0021_0F9258345D253650">
greate&s;t in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and irritable &s;y&s;tems. La&s;tly, The nervous power, or energy of the brain, differs greatly in point of &s;trength. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;trength of the body de|pended upon the &s;trength of the &s;imple &s;olids; and I allow that it is often connected with this. But, as the &s;tate of the &s;imple &s;olids cannot be &s;uddenly changed, tho&s;e changes of debility and &s;trength which are &s;udden and tran&s;itory, mu&s;t be owing to changes in the &s;tate of the nervous power. Thus, at the inva&s;ion of fevers, we ob&s;erve a con&s;iderable debility take place, more &s;uddenly than we can &s;uppo&s;e any change to be made in the &s;tate of the &s;imple &s;olids. Again, in maniacal per&s;ons, there is often an incredible increa&s;e of &s;trength, which we cannot &s;uppo&s;e to proceed from an increa&s;ed rigidity of the &s;imple &s;olids &s;o &s;uddenly produced. This &s;trength of the nervous power is oppo&s;ed to &s;en&s;ibility, as appears from a much &s;tronger do&s;e of any medicine being required, to produce the &s;ame effects on the above-mentioned maniac than other per&s;ons. In my opinion it is al&s;o oppo&s;ed to irritability, though not &s;o remarkably, for weakly &s;y&s;tems are, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> more irritable. Strength of nervous power is al&s;o oppo&s;ed to mobility, for the more weakly the &s;ubject the impre&s;&s;ions are more tran&s;itory, whereas in &s;trong people the contrary takes place.</P>
<P>Having thus enumerated the different cau&s;es of temperament, we &s;hall now con&s;ider how the&s;e cau&s;es are variou&s;ly combined, in order to form different temperaments. Of particular temperaments, tho&s;e are mo&s;t &s;trongly marked, which are owing to the different &s;tages of life. As changes in the &s;y&s;tem take place very gradually, it were proper to a&s;&s;ume a middle point, to and from which the &s;y&s;tem is gradually advancing or declining, and at the &s;ame time to mark the different gradation of decline and advance; but as this would be very difficult, I &s;hall only handle the matter gro&s;sly, and point out tho&s;e &s;tages where the mo&s;t remarkable changes occur. The&s;e may be reduced to four, Infancy, Youth, Manhood, and Old Age. To begin with the&s;e, therefore, in their order.</P>

The &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility and irritability continue, perhaps, as before, but the former is more accurate, from the ten&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;equently the fibres.

<HEAD>MANHOOD.</HEAD>
<P>It is difficult to fix this period; different per&s;ons attaining their Acm&eacute; at different times. I would take the thirty-fifth year for a &s;tandard. The &s;olids are now tending to exce&s;s of rigidity, with re|&s;pect to the middle point; the fluids are le&s;s, in proportion to the &s;olids, hence dryne&s;s begins to take place; the heart is &s;maller, with re&s;pect to the arteries, and exerts le&s;s force than formerly; hence &s;lower circulation, more copious &s;ecretion of oil, and obe&s;ity, with con&s;equent &s;ucculency. Hitherto little change has happened in the &s;tate of the fluids, but now they begin to tend towards acrimony. The arteries, now become le&s;s, and the ballance is turned to the &s;ide of the veins: The &s;ecretory glands are now increa&s;ed, while the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els are dimini&s;hed, as al&s;o the conglobate glands. Sen&s;ibility, irritability, mobility, and con&s;equently celerity and levity, gradually dimini&s;h from this time. Till this period the &s;trength has been gradually encrea&s;ing, but is now at its height, and afterwards decays, chiefly on account of the rigidity of every part of the &s;y&s;tem. In infants the mu&s;cles con&s;i&s;t of truly mu&s;cular fibres, or with very little tendon; but now the tendinous exceed the mu&s;cular parts, and in proportion perhaps the force is dimi|ni&s;hed. This &s;tate of manhood is very variable as to its period, happening in &s;ome &s;ooner, in others later; but from this to fifty, the changes are le&s;s remarkable than at any other &s;tate of life.</P>

cohe&s;ion. In&s;tead of an <HI>arterious,</HI> a <HI>venous</HI> plethora obtains. The lymphatic &s;y&s;tem almo&s;t di&s;appears. Both from weakne&s;s of the nervous power, and rigidity of the &s;imple &s;olids, &s;en&s;ibility, irritability and mobility, formerly &s;o remarkable, are now greatly dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Thus have we pretty well di&s;tingui&s;hed the four grand &s;tages of life, by the changes which are ob&s;erved to take place in the &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e different changes do not happen &s;o uniformly, but &s;ome pecu|liarities are remarkable through the whole of life. Thus each &s;ex is di&s;tingui&s;hed. In the female, there is greater laxity, with humidity and thinne&s;s of the fluids, arterious plethora, more &s;en&s;ibility, irrita|bility, levity and weakne&s;s, &s;o that in them the character of youth continues longer than in the male. In every per&s;on are appearances of a temperament peculiar to him&s;elf, though the Ancients only took notice of four, and &s;ome have imagined the&s;e were deduced from the theories of the four humours, or four cardinal qualities; but it is more probable that they were fir&s;t founded on ob&s;ervation, and afterwards adapted to tho&s;e theories, &s;ince we find that they have a real exi&s;tence, and are explicable on the doctrine already de|livered. The two that are mo&s;t di&s;tinctly marked, are the Sanguineous and Melancholic, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the temperaments of Youth and Age.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="temperament">
<HEAD>SANGUINEOUS.</HEAD>
<P>Here there is laxity of &s;olids, di&s;coverable by the &s;oftne&s;s of hair and &s;ucculency; large &s;y&s;tem of arteries, redundancy of fluids, florid complexion; &s;en&s;ibility of the nervous power, e&s;pecially to plea&s;ing objects; irritability from the plethora, mobility and levity from lax &s;olids. The&s;e characters are di&s;tinctly marked, and they are proved by the di&s;ea&s;es incident to this age, as haemorrhages, fevers, &amp;c. but the&s;e, as they proceed from a lax &s;y&s;tem, are more ea&s;ily cured.</P>

and leanne&s;s; &s;maller arteries, hence pale colour; venous plethora, hence turge&s;cency of the&s;e, and lividity; &s;en&s;ibility, frequently ex|qui&s;ite, but with great accuracy; moderate irritability, with remark|able <HI>tenacity</HI> of impre&s;&s;ions; &s;teadine&s;s in action and &s;lowne&s;s of motion, with great &s;trength; for exce&s;s of this con&s;titution in maniacs gives the mo&s;t extraordinary in&s;tance of human &s;trength I know. This temperament is mo&s;t di&s;tinctly marked in old age, and in males. The &s;anguineous temperament of youth makes us not di&s;tingui&s;h the me|lancholic till the decline of life, when it is very evident, from di&s;ea&s;es, (of the veins,) haemorrhoids, apoplexy, cachexy, ob&s;tructions of the vi&s;cera, particularly of the liver, drop&s;ies, affections of the alimentary canal, chiefly from &s;lower and weaker influence of the nervous power. So much for the &s;anguineous and melancholic tem|perament; the other two are not &s;o ea&s;ily explained. The Choleric temperament takes place between Youth and Manhood. In the CHOLERIC, the di&s;tribution of the fluids is more exactly ballanced; there is le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility, and le&s;s obe&s;ity, with more irritability, proceeding from greater ten&s;ion; le&s;s mobility and levity, and more &s;teadine&s;s in the &s;trength of the nervous power. As to the PHLEGMATIC: This temperament cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed by any characters of age or &s;ex: It agrees with the &s;anguineous in laxity and &s;ucculency; it differs from that temperament, and the melancholic, by the more exact di&s;tribution of the fluids. Again, it differs from the &s;anguine|ous, by having le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility, irritability, mobility, and perhaps &s;trength, though &s;ometimes, indeed, this la&s;t is found to be great.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the <HI>ancient temperaments,</HI> which we have brought in as in&s;tances of the combinations which might take place. The tem|peraments, indeed, are much more <HI>various,</HI> and very far from being ea&s;ily marked and reduced to their genera and &s;pecies, not only on account of variety of temperaments them&s;elves, but al&s;o on account
<PB N="20" REF="014000_0026_0F925838C98CB3C0">
of Idio&s;yncra&s;y. The whole of this &s;ubject might be prettily illu|&s;trated by con&s;idering the difference of genus, &amp;c. and even morals, to which the different temperaments are liable; but, as this di&s;|qui&s;ition is very &s;ubtile, and does not properly belong to this place, I &s;hall wave it on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>To conclude; the&s;e circum&s;tances, which we have ob&s;erved to concur chiefly in production of temperaments, were the more nece&s;&s;ary to be taken notice of, as they give indications in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;o may influence what we have to &s;ay on the &s;ubject of medicines; but as we have found that the nervous power alone is capable of con&s;iderable and &s;udden changes, it is to this that our medicines &s;hould be chiefly directed; for the &s;tate of the &s;imple &s;olids, the proportion and &s;tate of the fluids, and the di&s;tribution of the&s;e, we have little in our power. To this purpo&s;e ob&s;erve, 1. That medicines which act on the &s;imple &s;olids, cannot propagate far their effects on the &s;y&s;tem. 2. As to the &s;tate of the fluids, I &s;hall treat this more fully afterwards, and &s;hall only &s;ay at pre&s;ent, that me|dicines can have but little effect upon them, and any changes we can produce are produced by diet, and therefore mu&s;t be &s;low. 3. The di&s;tribution of the fluids is &s;carcely to be altered, but by the gradual progre&s;s of life, and therefore is mo&s;t of all out of the reach of medicines. 4. The &s;tate of the nervous power, is what medicines chiefly affect, and being that part of temperament which mo&s;tly modifies their operation, we &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon it in particular. Haller, in 2d. vol. of the <HI>Elem. Phy&s;iol.</HI> has treated on Temperaments; I therefore beg you would compare what I have &s;aid on this &s;ubject with his ob&s;ervations. We now go on to con&s;ider the influence of Idio&s;yncra&s;y and the effects of Cu&s;tom, as the doctrine of tem|peraments is every where perplexed and confounded with the&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>IDIOSYNCRASY.</HEAD>
<P>Idio&s;yncra&s;y is a peculiarity of temperament in a particular part of the &s;y&s;tem; <HI>e. g.</HI> Error on the &s;ide of laxity, or rigidity, or having a
<PB N="21" REF="014000_0027_0F92583980E1C4E0">
larger or le&s;s proportion of fluids to the &s;olids. The &s;tate of the fluids al&s;o is often affected by idio&s;yncra&s;y, being different in dif|ferent con&s;titutions, owing, as I believe, to peculiar ferments ope|rating in the &s;y&s;tem: Thus a putrefactive ferment may occa&s;ion a greater alkale&s;cency of the fluids even in a per&s;on who lives on vege|table diet, than in one who &s;eeds on animal food. Idio&s;yncra&s;y chiefly &s;hews it&s;elf, by a peculiar &s;en&s;ibility or irritability of a parti|cular part, which renders that part &s;u&s;ceptible of weak impre&s;&s;ions of one kind, and not of another; thus I have known a per&s;on faint at the &s;mell of mutton, which we will allow to be a very &s;ingular idio&s;yncra&s;y. No part of the &s;y&s;tem is exempt from idio&s;yncra&s;y: It is needle&s;s to enumerate them all, as you may do it your&s;elves by examining the di&s;ea&s;es on which they evidently depend. Nothing is more nece&s;&s;ary than to ob&s;erve, that the operation of medicines is as much or much more connected with idio&s;yncra&s;y than with temperament. In &s;hort, it has &s;uch an effect on the operation of medicines, that we &s;hould never give a do&s;e of any efficacious one, without previou&s;ly examining whether the patient has any &s;uch pe|culiarity, that contraindicates either the medicine it&s;elf, or its u&s;ual do&s;e: And if the patient have not yet experienced this medicine, it will be proper, as idio&s;yncra&s;y is often hereditary, to enquire if any &s;uch have ever affected his parents.</P>
<P>We are next to ob&s;erve, that both temperament and idio&s;yncra&s;y may be variou&s;ly affected by <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> in&s;omuch that by this any tem|perament may be corrected, confirmed, obliterated, or even a new one induced.</P>

<P>Every body knows the effect of Cu&s;tom, in the moral as well as the natural world, and therefore, without regarding the&s;e effects, we cannot be &s;aid to have fully handled the doctrines of tempera|ments and idio&s;yncra&s;y. Our time will only, however, allow to give the great outlines of this &s;ubject, which you afterwards may fill

up at your lei&s;ure. Cu&s;tom is the frequent <HI>repetition</HI> of impre&s;&s;ions on the &s;y&s;tem. Cu&s;tom is often confounded with habit. <HI>Habit</HI> is only the effect of Cu&s;tom, as when frequent repetition of impre&s;&s;ions <HI>has given laws to the &s;y&s;tem.</HI> The effects of cu&s;tom may be reduced to five heads. 1. On the &s;imple &s;olids. 2. On organs of &s;en&s;e. 3. On moving power. 4. On the whole nervous power. 5. On the &s;y&s;tem of blood ve&s;&s;els.</P>

<P><HI>Effects on the &s;imple &s;olids.</HI> Cu&s;tom determines the degree of flexibility, which they are capable. By frequently repeated flexion, the &s;everal particles of which the&s;e &s;olids con&s;i&s;t, are ren|dered more &s;upple and moveable on each other. A piece of catgut, <HI>e. g.</HI> when upon the &s;tretch, and having a weight appended to it's middle, will be bended thereby perhaps half an inch; afterwards, by frequent repetitions of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> weight, or by <HI>increa&s;ing</HI> the weight, the flexibility will be rendered double. The degree of flexibility has a great effect in determining the degree of o&s;cillation, provided that <HI>ela&s;ticity</HI> is not <HI>affected;</HI> if it go <HI>beyond</HI> this it produces flaccidity. Again, Cu&s;tom determines the degree of ten&s;ion; for the &s;ame ela&s;tic chord that now o&s;cillates in a certain degree of ten&s;ion, by frequent repetition of the&s;e o&s;cillations, it will be &s;o far relaxed, that the exten&s;ion mu&s;t be renewed, in order to produce the &s;ame ten&s;ion, and con&s;equently the &s;ame vibrations as at fir&s;t. The ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a certain degree of ten&s;ion appears in many in&s;tances in the animal oeconomy, as when different mu&s;cles concur to give a fixed point, or <HI>ten&s;ion</HI> to each other; and thus a weakly child totters as it walks, but by giving it a weight to carry, and by thus encrea&s;ing the ten&s;ion of the &s;y&s;tem, it walks more &s;teadily. In like manner the fullne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem gives &s;trength, by <HI>di&s;tending</HI> the ve&s;&s;els every where, and &s;o giving ten&s;ion; hence a man, by good nouri&s;hment, from being weak, acquires a great increa&s;e of &s;trength <HI>in a few days;</HI> and, on the other hand, evacuations <HI>weaken</HI> by <HI>taking</HI> off the ten&s;ion. The&s;e are the chief effects of ten&s;ion on the &s;y&s;tem. What I have here &s;aid mu&s;t not be <HI>&s;trictly</HI> applied to the &s;imple fibres, as, perhaps, it belongs partly to the moving fibres.</P>

<P><HI>Effects on the organs of &s;en&s;e.</HI> Repetition dimini&s;hes &s;en&s;ibility, and if, upon occa&s;ion, it &s;eems to increa&s;e it, it is only in &s;o far as it renders perception of the different degrees of impre&s;&s;ion more accurate. Repetition alone gives la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions, and thus lays the founda|tion of memory; for &s;ingle impre&s;&s;ions are but retained for a &s;hort time, and are &s;oon forgot. Thus a per&s;on, who at pre&s;ent has little knowledge of cloths, will, by frequently handling them, acquire a &s;kill of di&s;cerning them, which to others &s;eems almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible. Many are apt to mi&s;take this for a nicer <HI>&s;en&s;ibility,</HI> but they are much mi&s;taken; for it is an univer&s;al law, that the repetition of impre&s;&s;ion renders us le&s;s acute. This is well illu&s;trated by the operation of medicines; for all medicines which act on the organs of &s;en&s;e mu&s;t, after &s;ome time, be increa&s;ed in their do&s;e, to produce the &s;ame effects as at fir&s;t. This affords us a rule in practice with regard to the&s;e medicines; it becoming nece&s;&s;ary, after a certain time, to change one medicine even for a weaker of the <HI>&s;ame nature.</HI> Thus medicines, which even have no great apparent force, are found, by long u&s;e, to de&s;troy the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;y&s;tem to other impre&s;&s;ions. But to this general rule, that, by repetition, the force of impre&s;&s;ions is more and more dimini&s;hed, there are &s;ome exceptions. Thus I have known per&s;ons, by frequent emetics, render their &s;tomachs &s;o irritable, that one-twentieth of the fir&s;t do&s;e was &s;ufficient to produce the &s;ame effect. This, I believe, oftner takes place when the vomit is repeated <HI>every day,</HI> or <HI>oftner,</HI> as I have &s;ometimes &s;een; for if the &s;ame vomit be given at pretty con&s;iderable <HI>intervals,</HI> the general rule is ob&s;erved to hold good. Thus two contrary effects of habit are to be noted; and it is proper to ob&s;erve, that the greater irritability is more readily produced when the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion is <HI>great,</HI> as in the ca&s;e fir&s;t given of the &s;trong emetic. This may be farther illu&s;trated by the effect of fear, which is commonly ob&s;erved to be dimini&s;hed on repetition, which can only be attributed to cu&s;tom; while, on the other hand, there are in&s;tances of per&s;ons, who, having once got a <HI>great</HI> fright, have for ever after continued &s;laves to fears excited by impre&s;&s;ions of the like kind, however &s;light, which mu&s;t be imputed entirely to <HI>exce&s;s</HI> of the
<PB N="24" REF="014000_0030_0F9258401F588D28">
fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, as has been already ob&s;erved. The determining the force of impre&s;&s;ions from the relation they have to each other, is nece&s;&s;ary to be taken notice of here. In this manner the <HI>want</HI> of any particular &s;en&s;ation becomes unea&s;y. Weak &s;en&s;ations approach|ing to this <HI>want</HI> are therefore di&s;agreeable. Very &s;trong &s;en&s;ations are, on the other hand, di&s;agreeable likewi&s;e, becau&s;e plea&s;ant &s;en&s;a|tions are generally of a <HI>middle force</HI> of impre&s;&s;ion, though, no doubt, they &s;ometimes depend on the nature of the impre&s;&s;ion. The reflex &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure and pain are mutually exchangeable by repe|tition, in con&s;equence of the force being dimini&s;hed or augmented. Thus tobacco, certainly at fir&s;t very unplea&s;ant, by cu&s;tom is ren|dered very &s;oon agreeable. The plea&s;ing <HI>middle</HI> impre&s;&s;ions become at la&s;t <HI>in&s;ipid</HI> by repetition. Hence the love of novelty. Not only are our &s;en&s;ations varied in this manner, but they al&s;o, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, depend on <HI>relation.</HI> Thus, according to the &s;tate of the body, the &s;ame thing feels <HI>cold</HI> at one time, and <HI>warm</HI> at another. Plea|&s;ing objects al&s;o vary in the &s;ame manner. Much u&s;e has been made of heat and cold in philo&s;ophy, and many endeavours made to e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;itive nature in each. What I have now &s;aid con|tributes&punc; among other arguments, to &s;how they are purely <HI>relative.</HI> This leads me to an ob&s;ervation I formerly made, that increa&s;ed den&s;ity and rigidity of our fibres <HI>dimini&s;hes</HI> &s;en&s;ibility, which, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> is ob&s;ervable at all periods of life; &s;o that, in this view, <HI>cold</HI> not only operates on our &s;y&s;tem by <HI>repetition,</HI> but al&s;o by con|tracting the &s;olids and rendering them more rigid: While <HI>beat</HI> has the contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ffect, of encrea&s;ing &s;en&s;ibility, by <HI>relaxation.</HI> To this head al&s;o belongs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, which is the foundation of memory and all our intellectual faculties, and is entirely the effect of cu&s;tom; its influence even on morals is very great, but the con&s;i|deration of it does not properly belong to this place. With regard to the body al&s;o, the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations often take place. <HI>E. g.</HI> A di&s;|agreeable medicine will cau&s;e a nau&s;ea, or even vomiting, and ever afterwards the &s;ight of it will produce the &s;ame effects. We &s;hall only make one application of this in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, which very much depends on avoiding irritation. It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore in
<PB N="25" REF="014000_0031_0F925840547E5680">
&s;uch ca&s;es, to avoid not only the irritating or exciting cau&s;e, but al&s;o every other which have been any way connected with it. Thus when maniacs are &s;trongly affected with the &s;ight of any one per&s;on, we mu&s;t not only keep the per&s;on out of their &s;ight, but every other, who, being often &s;een with that per&s;on, might recall him to their re|membrance. Again, in producing effects on the body, a&s;&s;ociations &s;eemingly oppo&s;ite are formed, which, through cu&s;tom, become ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>e. g.</HI> A per&s;on long accu&s;tomed to &s;leep in the neighbourhood of a great noi&s;e, is &s;o far from being incommoded on that account, that afterwards &s;uch noi&s;e becomes nece&s;&s;ary to pro|duce &s;leep. It will be of u&s;e to attend to this in practice, for we ought to allow for, however oppo&s;ite it may &s;eem at the time, what|ever u&s;ually attended the purpo&s;e we de&s;igned to effect. Thus, in the in&s;tance of &s;leep, we mu&s;t not exclude noi&s;e when we want to procure re&s;t, or any cau&s;es which may &s;eem oppo&s;ite to &s;uch an effect, pro|vided cu&s;tom has rendered them nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

This &s;ubject of ten&s;ion, formerly attributed to the <HI>&s;imple fibres,</HI> is probably more &s;trictly applicable to the moving; for, be&s;ides a ten&s;ion from exten&s;ion, there is al&s;o a ten&s;ion from <HI>irritation</HI> and <HI>&s;ym|pathy; e. g.</HI> The ten&s;ion of the &s;tomach from food, gives ten&s;ion to the whole body. Wine and &s;pirituous liquors give ten&s;ion; <HI>e. g.</HI> a per&s;on that is &s;o affected with <HI>tremor</HI> as &s;carcely to hold a gla&s;s of any of the&s;e liquors to his head, has no &s;ooner &s;wallowed it, than his whole body becomes <HI>&s;teady,</HI> and after the &s;y&s;tem has been <HI>accu&s;tomed</HI> to &s;uch &s;timuli, if they are not applied at the u&s;ual time, the whole body becomes flaccid, and, of con&s;equence, un&s;teady in its motions.</P>
<P>Again, cu&s;tom gives <HI>facility</HI> of motion. This &s;eems to proceed from the di&s;ten&s;ion which the nervous power gives to the moving fibres them&s;elves. But in what ever manner it is occa&s;ioned, the effect is obvious, for any new or unu&s;ual motion is performed with great difficulty.</P>
<P>We have &s;hewn that &s;en&s;ation depends on a communication with the <HI>&s;en&s;orium commune,</HI> by means of organs &s;ufficiently di&s;tended with nervous influence. We have likewi&s;e found, that &s;en&s;ibility is <HI>dimini&s;hed</HI> by repetition. I am now to ob&s;erve, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome ca&s;es it may be <HI>encrea&s;ed</HI> by repetition, owing to the nervous power it&s;elf flowing more ea&s;ily into the part, on account of cu&s;tom. Attention to a particular object may al&s;o determine a greater influx into any particular part, and thus the &s;en&s;ibility and irritability of that parti|cular part may be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>But with regard to <HI>facility</HI> of motion, the nervous power, no doubt, flows mo&s;t ea&s;ily into tho&s;e parts, to which it has been accu&s;tomed: But facility of motion does not <HI>entirely</HI> depend on this, but in part al&s;o on the concurrence of the action of a great many mu&s;cles; <HI>e. g. Win&s;low</HI> has ob&s;erved, that in performing any motion a number of mu&s;cles concur to give a fixed point to tho&s;e intended <HI>chiefly to act,</HI> as well as to <HI>others</HI> that are to <HI>vary</HI> and <HI>modify</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="014000_0033_0F925846925FACA0">
their action. All this is a&s;&s;i&s;ted, not only by the influx into the &s;everal mu&s;cles becoming more free, but al&s;o by frequent repetition, as it is only by &s;uch experience that we learn the mo&s;t proper atti|tude and concurrence of mu&s;cles for performing any action with facility and &s;teadine&s;s.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom gives a &s;pontaneous motion al&s;o, which &s;eems to recur at &s;tated periods, even when the exciting cau&s;es are removed; and there are not wanting in&s;tances of habitual vomiting, from the in|judicious admini&s;tration of emetics. It is on this account that all &s;pa&s;modic affections &s;o ea&s;ily become habitual, and are &s;o difficult of cure, as we mu&s;t not only avoid all the exciting cau&s;es, even in the &s;malle&s;t degree, but al&s;o their a&s;&s;ociations.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom al&s;o gives <HI>&s;trength</HI> of motion: Strength depends on &s;trong <HI>o&s;cillations,</HI> a free and <HI>copious influx</HI> of the <HI>nervous power,</HI> and on <HI>den&s;e &s;olids.</HI> But in what manner all the&s;e circum&s;tances have been brought about by repetition, has been already explained. The effect of cu&s;tom, in producing &s;trength, may be thus illu&s;trated: A man that begins with lifting a calf, by continuing the &s;ame practice every day, will be able to lift it when grown to the full &s;ize of a bull.</P>
<P>All this is of con&s;iderable importance in the practice of Phy&s;ic, though but too little regarded; for the recovery of weak people, in great mea&s;ure, depends on the u&s;e of exerci&s;e, &s;uited to their &s;trength, or rather <HI>within</HI> it, frequently repeated and gradually increa&s;ed. Farther, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that Cu&s;tom regu|lates the particular celerity with which each motion is to be per|formed; for a per&s;on accu&s;tomed, for a con&s;iderable time, to one degree of celerity, becomes incapable of a greater; <HI>e. g.</HI> A man accu&s;tomed to &s;low walking will be out of breath before he can <HI>run</HI> twenty paces. The <HI>train,</HI> or order, in which our motions are to be performed, is al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed by Cu&s;tom; for if a man hath
<PB N="28" REF="014000_0034_0F9258470527D6E8">
repeated motions, for a certain time, in any particular order, he cannot afterwards perform them in any other. Cu&s;tom al&s;o very frequently <HI>a&s;&s;ociates</HI> motions and &s;en&s;ations: Thus, if a per&s;on has been in u&s;e of a&s;&s;ociating certain ideas with the ordinary &s;timulus, which in health excites urine, without the&s;e ideas the u&s;ual incli|nation will &s;carce excite that excretion; and, when the&s;e occur, will require it even in the ab&s;ence of the primary exciting cau&s;e; <HI>e. g.</HI> It is very ordinary for a per&s;on to make urine when going to bed, and if he has been, for any length of time, accu&s;tomed to do &s;o, he will ever afterwards make urine at that time, though other|wi&s;e he would often have no &s;uch inclination: By this means &s;ome &s;ecretions become, in a manner, &s;ubject to the will. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of going to &s;tool: And this affords us a good rule in the ca&s;e of co&s;tivene&s;s; for by endeavouring to fix a &s;tated time for this evacuation, it will afterwards, at &s;uch time, more readily return. It is farther remarkable, that motions are in&s;eparably a&s;&s;ociated with other motions: This, perhaps, very often proceeds from the nece&s;|&s;ary degree of ten&s;ion, but it al&s;o often depends merely on Cu&s;tom, an in&s;tance of which we have in the uniform motions of our eyes.</P>
<P>On Cu&s;tom depends the &s;trength and &s;teadine&s;s, perhaps, of all the internal functions, as, <HI>e. g.</HI> the heart, which probably was once under the power of the will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;teadine&s;s, produced by Cu&s;tom, &s;erves a good purpo&s;e, as otherwi&s;e the heart, being under the power of the will, would be too liable to its pa&s;&s;ions.</NOTE>.

<P><HI>Effects of Cu&s;tom on the whole nervous power.</HI> We have found that, by Cu&s;tom, the nervous influence may be determined more ea&s;ily into one part than another, and therefore, as all the parts of
<PB N="29" REF="014000_0035_0F925847F7EC5090">
the &s;y&s;tem are &s;trongly connected, the &s;en&s;ibility, irritability, and &s;trength of any particular part, may be thus increa&s;ed. Cu&s;tom al&s;o has the power of altering the natural temperament, and of in|ducing a new one. It is al&s;o in the power of Cu&s;tom to render motions periodical, and periodically &s;pontaneous. An in&s;tance of this we have in &s;leep, which is commonly &s;aid to be owing to the nervour power being exhau&s;ted, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of which is &s;leep, <HI>i. e.</HI> a re&s;t of the voluntary motions to favour the recruit of that power: But if this were the ca&s;e, the return of &s;leep &s;hould be at different times, according as the cau&s;es which dimini&s;h the nervous influence operate more or le&s;s powerfully; whereas the ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e, the&s;e returns of &s;leep being quite regular. This is no le&s;s remarkable in the appetites, that return at particular pe|riods, independent of every cau&s;e but Cu&s;tom. Hunger, <HI>e. g.</HI> is an extremely unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation, but goes off of it&s;elf, if the per&s;on does not take food at the u&s;ual time. The excretions are farther proofs of this, <HI>e. g.</HI> going to &s;tool, which, if it depended on any particular irritation, &s;hould be at longer or &s;horter intervals, according to the nature of the aliment. There are many other in&s;tances of this di&s;po&s;ition of the nervous influence to periodical motions, as the &s;tory of the Idiot of <HI>Stafford,</HI> recorded by Dr. <HI>Plot, (Spectator,</HI> No. 447.) who, being accu&s;tomed to tell the hours of the church clock, as it &s;truck, told them as exactly when it did not &s;trike, by its being out of order. Montaigne tells us of &s;ome oxen that were employed in a machine for drawing water, who, after making three hundred turns, which was the u&s;ual number, could be &s;timulated by no whip or goad to proceed farther. Infants, al&s;o, cry for, and expect the brea&s;t, at tho&s;e times in which the nur&s;e has been accu&s;tomed to give it.</P>
<P>Hence it would appear, that the human oeconomy is &s;ubject to periodical revolutions, and that the&s;e happen not oftner may be imputed to variety; and this &s;eems to be the rea&s;on why they oftner happen in the body than mind, becau&s;e that is &s;ubject to greater variety. We &s;ee frequent in&s;tances of this in di&s;ea&s;es, and in their

cri&s;is; intermitting fevers, epilep&s;ies, a&s;thmas, &amp;c. are examples of periodical affections: And that critical days are not &s;o &s;trongly marked in this country as in Greece, and &s;ome others may be imputed to the variety and in&s;tability of our climate, but perhaps &s;till more to the le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility and irritability of our &s;y&s;tem, for the exhibition of medicine has little effect in di&s;turbing the cri&s;is, though it be commonly a&s;&s;igned as a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We are likewi&s;e &s;ubject to many habits independent of our|&s;elves, as from the revolutions of the cele&s;tial bodies, particularly the &s;un, which determines the body, perhaps, to other daily re|volutions be&s;ides &s;leeping and waking. There are al&s;o certain habits depending on the &s;ea&s;ons. Our connections, likewi&s;e, with re&s;pect to mankind, are means of inducing habits. Thus regula|rity from a&s;&s;ociating in bu&s;ine&s;s, induces regular habits both of mind and body.</P>
<P>There are many di&s;ea&s;es, which, though they aro&s;e at fir&s;t from particular cau&s;es, at la&s;t continue merely through cu&s;tom, or habit. The&s;e are chiefly of the nervous &s;y&s;tem. We &s;hould, therefore, &s;tudy to counteract &s;uch habits; and accordingly Hip|pocrates, among other things for the cure of epilep&s;y, orders an entire change of the manner of life. We likewi&s;e imitate this in the chincough, which often re&s;i&s;ts all remedies till the air, diet, and ordinary train of life are changed.</P>

On this head I may ob&s;erve, that blood-letting has a manife&s;t tendency to increa&s;e the quantity of the blood; and if this evacu|ation be repeated at &s;tated times, &s;uch &s;ymptoms of repletion, and &s;uch motions are excited at the&s;e times as render the operation ne|ce&s;&s;ary. The &s;ame has been ob&s;erved in &s;ome &s;pontaneous haemor|rhages. The&s;e, indeed, at fir&s;t, may have &s;ome exciting cau&s;es, but afterwards they &s;eem to depend chiefly on Cu&s;tom. The be&s;t proof of this is with regard to the men&s;trual evacuation. There is certainly &s;omething originally in females, that determines that evacuation to monthly periods. Con&s;tant repetition of this, comes to fix it, independent of &s;trong cau&s;es, either favouring or preventing repletion; <HI>e. g.</HI> blood-letting will not impede it, nor filling the body induce it: And, indeed, &s;o much is this evacuation connected with periodical motions, that it is little in our power to produce any effect by medicines but at tho&s;e particular times. Thus if we would relax the uterine &s;y&s;tem, and bring back this evacuation when &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, our attempts would be vain and fruitle&s;s, unle&s;s given at that time when the men&s;es &s;hould have naturally returned.</P>

This I have done; but to &s;hun di&s;putes which are unavoidable on &s;o dark a &s;ubject, I have rendered the divi&s;ion very <HI>general.</HI> I have, with the generality of authors, divided medicines into two cla&s;&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> tho&s;e which act on the <HI>&s;olids,</HI> and tho&s;e which act on the <HI>fluids.</HI> Some have added a third cla&s;s, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> tho&s;e which act on both &s;olids and fluids. This I have not done, becau&s;e it often happens that the&s;e actions are only <HI>&s;econdary,</HI> pro|ceeding from their action on the &s;olids or fluids. There are, no doubt, medicines which act on <HI>both</HI> &s;olids and fluids at the &s;ame time, as &s;alts; but as no medicine whatever is perfectly <HI>&s;imple</HI> in its operation, I chu&s;e to cla&s;s &s;uch medicines as &s;eem <HI>complex</HI> in their operation, under that head to which their principal action belongs.</P>
<P>Thus far I have explained my general plan of indication. There may, indeed, be &s;tarted &s;ome objections, <HI>e. g.</HI> It may be &s;aid, if evacuants, in&s;tead of acting on the <HI>fluids,</HI> as I have cla&s;&s;ed them in my table, produce their effect by operating on the <HI>&s;olids;</HI> I admit the force of this objection, though it appears allowable to take the ulti|mate effect in&s;tead of the cau&s;e, and the more &s;o as it is con&s;onant to the u&s;ual &s;y&s;tems. I have made two divi&s;ions of the medicines which act on the &s;olids. The fir&s;t comprehends tho&s;e which act on the <HI>&s;imple</HI> fibres, the &s;econd tho&s;e which act on the <HI>moving</HI> fibres, or, as Gaubius calls them, <HI>&s;olida viva.</HI> I have ranged the medicines which act on the <HI>&s;imple</HI> &s;olids according to the di&s;ea&s;es to which <HI>they</HI> are liable. My indications here are taken from Boerhaave, who, in his chapter <HI>de morbis fibrae debilis &amp; laxae,</HI> begins with <HI>nutrientia, i. e.</HI> tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances which afford matter for nouri&s;hing the weakened fibres. This indication, indeed, is not <HI>&s;trictly</HI> correct, for though in &s;ome mea&s;ure it is applicable, yet it is not calculated to bring about <HI>&s;udden</HI> changes. I now proceed to explain tho&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="014000_0039_0F92584AC866DD18">
technical terms which I employ in order that my meaning may afterwards be under&s;tood. To begin, then.</P>
<P>By <HI>nutrientia,</HI> I mean every thing received by mankind as food. The &s;econd indication in laxity comprehends &s;uch medicines as increa&s;e the cohe&s;ion of the particles of the &s;imple fibres, and &s;o render them more den&s;e. The&s;e we have di&s;tingui&s;hed by <HI>a&s;trin|gentia.</HI> This term has been u&s;ed more loo&s;ely, for every thing that gives &s;trength, and &s;tops evacuations that are &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from laxity. In the ca&s;e of rigidity of the &s;imple fibres, there are al&s;o two indications, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> 1. To dimini&s;h the nutriment or appli|cation of new &s;ub&s;tance to the &s;olid fibre; but of this afterward. The &s;econd that is mentioned in the table comprehends emollients, by which I under&s;tand &s;uch medicines as dimini&s;h the <HI>cohe&s;ion</HI> of the &s;imple fibres.</P>
<P>We next &s;peak of tho&s;e medicines which act on the <HI>&s;olida viva.</HI> The di&s;ea&s;es of the moving fibres are very various, but taking a general view of them, we reduce them to three kinds; 1. Where contractility or motion are <HI>dimini&s;hed.</HI> 2. Where they are too <HI>&s;trong,</HI> or too much <HI>increa&s;ed.</HI> 3. Where there is <HI>irregularity</HI> of motions. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the <HI>&s;timulants</HI> are indicated, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> &s;uch medicines as excite more vigorous contractions. 2. Here are indicated the <HI>&s;edativa,</HI> by which term I mean tho&s;e medicines, in whatever man|ner they act, which dimini&s;h too great contractility and motion. 3. In this ca&s;e the <HI>anti&s;pa&s;modica</HI> are indicated, under which term, to avoid cavil, I mean &s;uch medicines as <HI>compo&s;e,</HI> or <HI>take off,</HI> irre|gular motions in our &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e medicine which act on the fluids, in compliance to general cu&s;tom, I divided into <HI>alterants</HI> and <HI>evacuants.</HI> By the fir&s;t, I mean medicines which produce changes in the <HI>circulating</HI> fluids, and are reckoned of two kinds, as they operate on the <HI>mixture</HI> or <HI>con&s;i&s;tence</HI> of our fluids; though perhaps the&s;e cannot be &s;eparated, as we have already ob&s;erved in the preliminary lectures. With regard to the
<PB N="34" REF="014000_0040_0F92584B88693E78">
con&s;i&s;tence of our fluids, they may be too thick, (which property is called lentor and vi&s;co&s;ity,) or too thin. Remedies for the fir&s;t are called <HI>attenuantia,</HI> for the la&s;t <HI>in&s;pi&s;&s;antia.</HI> As to mixture we are well acquainted with its variety only in <HI>one</HI> ca&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>acrimony</HI> There may, indeed, be other faults, but the&s;e we neglect, as the doctrine of the fluids is very incomplete. Medicines adapted to acrimony are of two kinds. Fir&s;t, tho&s;e for acrimony in general, the <HI>demulcentia.</HI> The &s;econd, are tho&s;e &s;uited to particular kinds of acrimony. Some have entered with great &s;ubtility in their enquiries into the different kinds of acrimony, but it appears to me, that we are only well acquainted with two &s;pecies, which are the &s;ource of the re&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>acid</HI> and <HI>alkaline.</HI> Mo&s;t part of what our own fluids are formed of, either are <HI>originally</HI> or have a <HI>tendency</HI> to become acid in the &s;tomach, and, therefore, we may <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> an acid acrimony even &s;ometimes to enter the &s;y&s;tem, and to prevail there. Medicines which correct this acrimony I have termed <HI>antacid.</HI> Again, it is found to be the con&s;tant effect of the animal oeconomy to convert the acid into an oppo&s;ite acrimony. Some affirm, that this is a perfect alkali, but all agree it is of alkale&s;cent nature. The medi|cines again&s;t this acrimony I have named <HI>antalkalina.</HI> In the general indication for correcting acrimony, I might have made a divi&s;ion; fir&s;t, into tho&s;e medicines which correct, and, &s;econdly, into tho&s;e which obviate acrimony. Tho&s;e that obviate the too great acrimonious alkale&s;cency of our fluids I have &s;et down under the title of <HI>anti&s;eptica.</HI></P>
<P>Having explained the different terms which occured under the head of <HI>alterantia,</HI> we are now to con&s;ider tho&s;e under <HI>evacuantia.</HI> By this term we under&s;tand tho&s;e medicines which encrea&s;e the <HI>excretion</HI> of fluids to be thrown out of the body. There may, indeed, be remedies which encrea&s;e the internal <HI>&s;ecretions,</HI> but we are as yet unacquainted with them; <HI>e. g.</HI> we have no medicine which will purge the pancreas alone without affecting the inte&s;tinal glands.

To <HI>nutrientia</HI> are the terms <HI>re&s;taurantia</HI> and <HI>analeptica,</HI> for they are only a &s;pecies of <HI>nutrientia.</HI> Writers have extended the meaning farther, and ranked under this head, many I comprehend under medicines: For if &s;alep, &s;atyrion, &amp;c. be re&s;toratives, it is only &s;o far as they are <HI>nutritives. Linnaeus</HI> names <HI>analeptica</HI> tho&s;e medicines, <HI>quae vires in&s;tant,</HI> or which quickly give a certain vigor to the &s;y&s;tem, as wine, &amp;c. but the&s;e properly belong to the <HI>&s;timulantia.</HI></P>
<P>II. <HI>Ad&s;tringentia.</HI> 1. <HI>Ex&s;iccantia;</HI> this term &s;hould be confined to <HI>external</HI> medicines; for though laxity may depend upon moi&s;ture,
<PB N="36" REF="014000_0042_0F92584D45037E38">
they can only act in external applications, for if there be &s;uch internal remedies they mu&s;t act as a&s;tringents. 2. <HI>Indurantia:</HI> This is al&s;o a complex term, for they harden, by bringing the fibres clo&s;er together, and &s;o are no other than a&s;tringents. 3. <HI>Roborantia:</HI> This is al&s;o a complex term, comprehending medicines of different cla&s;&s;es, as <HI>nutrientia,</HI> &amp;c. but in &s;o far as the&s;e medicines act on the &s;imple fibres, they are the &s;ame as <HI>ad&s;tringentia.</HI> 4. When our fibres are endued with a power nece&s;&s;ary to perform the functions, they are &s;aid to be in tone; medicines, therefore, which promote this &s;tate are called <HI>tonic,</HI> but they act only as <HI>a&s;tringents.</HI> 5. <HI>Si&s;ten|tia,</HI> or medicines which &s;top evacuations. The&s;e are commonly <HI>a&s;tringent:</HI> But this term ought to be rejected, as it leads to an ambiguity. Opium, <HI>e. g.</HI> is a powerful &s;i&s;tent, though it does not act by its a&s;tringent quality, but by taking off the &s;en&s;ibility of the fibres, and &s;o dimini&s;hing their o&s;cillations.</P>
<P>III. <HI>Emollientia.</HI> 1. <HI>Laxantia:</HI> This is &s;ynonymous to <HI>emollientia,</HI> and perhaps the properer of the two&punc; were it not ambiguous, by its being applicable likewi&s;e to purg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ives of a more gentle kind. 2. <HI>Humectantia:</HI> This term is al&s;o &s;ynonymous, comprehending &s;uch medicines as add moi&s;ture to the fibres which is perhaps the chief effect of emollients; but &s;ome extend the meaning of <HI>humectantia</HI> farther, to encrea&s;e the fluid part of the &s;y&s;tem in general.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Stimulantia.</HI> 1. <HI>Calefacientia:</HI> As there is no way of in|crea&s;ing animal heat, but by increa&s;ing motion, all the medicines comprehended under this term are really &s;timulants. 2. <HI>Attra|hentia:</HI> This term &s;trictly means all tho&s;e topical medicines that determine a greater flow of the humours externally; but the&s;e, in my opinion, are univer&s;ally &s;timulants. The term <HI>attrahentia</HI> comprehends three &s;ubdivi&s;ions; fir&s;t, &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as increa&s;e the heat of the part; &s;econdly, tho&s;e which excite the heat with &s;ome degree of inflammation, called <HI>rubefacientia;</HI> thirdly, tho&s;e which rai&s;e bli&s;ters, the <HI>ve&s;icantia,</HI> and now frequently <HI>epi&s;pa&s;tica,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="014000_0043_0F92584DF3BA2060">
though this term more &s;trictly implies <HI>attrahentia,</HI> and is &s;ynony|mous to it.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Sedativa.</HI> I have formerly ob&s;erved, that this is a complex indication: As the &s;ub&s;tances which dimini&s;h motion in the &s;y&s;tem are very various, hence the &s;ynonimes of <HI>&s;edativa</HI> mu&s;t be &s;o too; <HI>e. g. Antiphlogi&s;tic</HI> is a term very generally u&s;ed for &s;ub&s;tances which abate inflammation; but, as the&s;e depend on an increa&s;ed motion, in this &s;en&s;e the term is the &s;ame as <HI>&s;edativa.</HI> Antiphlo|gi&s;tics are al&s;o &s;uch medicines as relax the &s;olids, de&s;troy contrac|tility, or attenuate the fluids; but here the term, being too loo&s;e, ought to be rejected, 2. <HI>Refrigerantia:</HI> This term is more pre|ci&s;e, meaning &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as dimini&s;h the motion of a particular part, or of the &s;y&s;tem in general. I &s;hall not here enquire into the manner in which the&s;e effects are produced. 3. <HI>Anodyna:</HI> This term &s;trictly means medicines which ea&s;e pain. It would be difficult to determine whether there is an increa&s;ed motion in every ca&s;e of pain; if &s;o, which I think probable, all anodynes are &s;edatives. Whatever be in this, anodynes, I may &s;ay, act fir&s;t either by dimini&s;hing the motion, or taking off the feeling of the pained part. Of late, anodyne has been confined to medicines which act in this la&s;t way, and therefore is commonly under&s;tood to be the &s;ame with <HI>hypnotica,</HI> or &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as induce &s;leep, though it would be more proper to make a di&s;tinction. <HI>Somnifera</HI> and <HI>&s;opori|fera</HI> are the &s;ame as <HI>hypnotica,</HI> and all &s;ynonymous to <HI>&s;edativa.</HI> La&s;tly, <HI>Paregorica,</HI> which, by the ancient Phy&s;icians, were con&s;i|dered as <HI>&s;edativa,</HI> and the &s;trict meaning of the term implies that &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>Anti&s;pa&s;modica.</HI> To this term, the only &s;ynonymous term I know, is <HI>carminative,</HI> which &s;trictly implies &s;uch anti&s;pa&s;modics as have the power of taking off &s;pa&s;ms depending on intercepted air in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">e&s;tines.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="014000_0044_0F92585C9A2417C8">
VII. <HI>Attenuantia.</HI> The&s;e act either, fir&s;t, by increa&s;ing the quantity of our fluids, or, &s;econdly, by dimini&s;hing the cohe&s;ion, the quantity continuing the &s;ame. 1. <HI>Diluentia:</HI> This term is &s;ynonymous to the fir&s;t &s;ignification of <HI>attenuantia,</HI> and diluents only act in proportion to the quantity of water they contain, water being the only diluent: But writers on the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> often, im|properly, u&s;e this term in the &s;ame general &s;en&s;e as <HI>attenuantia.</HI> 2. <HI>Incidentia:</HI> This is u&s;ed in the &s;econd &s;ignification of <HI>attenuantia,</HI> and is thus called from a &s;uppo&s;ed theory, that &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances break down the fluids as with &s;harp edges or points. 3. <HI>Re&s;ol|ventia</HI> are properly &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as give fluidity to portions of our fluids, that had been formerly concreted. Authors, however, u&s;e this term in the &s;ame general &s;en&s;e as <HI>attenuantia,</HI> and not without propriety, as the &s;ame medicines an&s;wer both intentions.</P>
<P>VIII. <HI>In&s;pi&s;&s;antia.</HI> 1. <HI>Incra&s;&s;antia:</HI> This term is, perhaps, equally proper.</P>
<P>IX. <HI>Demulcentia.</HI> Such &s;ub&s;tances as cover and &s;heath acri|mony, are called demulcents. 1. <HI>Antacria: Materia Medica</HI> writers u&s;e this term in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as I do <HI>demulcents,</HI> but improperly, as this term may imploy every medicine which de&s;troys acrimony, as <HI>antacida,</HI> &amp;c. and even tho&s;e which obviate acrimony, as the <HI>anti&s;eptica.</HI> 2. <HI>Lenientia:</HI> This has been u&s;ed for <HI>emollientia,</HI> but it is properly &s;ynonymous to <HI>demulcentia.</HI> Other terms have been introduced from theories, <HI>e. g.</HI> Acrimony has been &s;uppo&s;ed to depend on angular pointed &s;piculae, hence <HI>obtundentia,</HI> and <HI>obvol|ventia,</HI> which mean &s;uch medicines as break off and &s;heath the&s;e &s;piculae: But the&s;e terms &s;hould be avoided, as this theory is neither clear nor well founded. Again, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed that acrimony depends on the two great prevalency of any of the com|ponent parts of the blood, and tho&s;e medicines which brought it back to its own natural &s;tate, which they &s;uppo&s;ed always to be bland, were called <HI>temperantia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="014000_0045_0F92585CCFC8D908">
X. <HI>Antacida.</HI> Boerhaave has divided this cla&s;s into <HI>ab&s;orbentia</HI> and <HI>immutentia;</HI> by the fir&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as took the acid into their pores without changing its nature; and by the la&s;t, tho&s;e which did. But we now know that nothing ab&s;orbs an acid, without a <HI>tertium quid</HI> re&s;ulting. In the fir&s;t intention, ab&s;orbent earths can only be u&s;ed; in the la&s;t, alkaline &s;alts.</P>
<P>XI. <HI>Antalkalina.</HI> This term has no &s;ynonymes.</P>
<P>XII. <HI>Anti&s;eptica.</HI> I know no &s;ynonymous term to this but <HI>con|dientia,</HI> employed by De Gorter. By <HI>anti&s;eptics,</HI> we mean &s;uch medicines as obviate the too great putre&s;cency of our fluids; but <HI>condientia</HI> extends farther, implying &s;uch medicines as, without obviating any particular changes, keep the fluids in their pre&s;ent &s;tate. But the fluid circulating in our ve&s;&s;els being &s;ubject only to putre&s;cency, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that any &s;uch medicines, of that kind, exi&s;t, except they are anti&s;eptics.</P>
<P>XIII. <HI>Errhina.</HI> Synonymous to this term is <HI>ptermica</HI> and <HI>&s;ternu|tatoria,</HI></P>
<P>XIV. <HI>Sialagoga.</HI> To this is &s;ynonymous the <HI>Apophlegmatizonta,</HI> which is likewi&s;e &s;ynonymous to <HI>errhina.</HI> It is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t more upon the&s;e terms, as they are plain from the very etymology; and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, we &s;hall pa&s;s overtho&s;e that follow in the catalogue.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next take notice of &s;uch terms as have been employed by other <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers, and are va&s;tly too complex to give a di&s;tinct idea of the indications they are intended to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Many di&s;ea&s;es have been &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from ob&s;truction, and &s;o the cure of the di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t be effected by removing that ob&s;truction: Hence the terms <HI>aperientia, deob&s;truentia, deoppilantia. Aperientia</HI> has been u&s;ed, in a more vague &s;en&s;e, for every medicine which, in whatever manner, re&s;olves ob&s;truction; and al&s;o for
<PB N="40" REF="014000_0046_0F92585EB15C3B00">
&s;uch as increa&s;e &s;ecretions, though no ob&s;truction &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. <HI>Deoppi|lantia</HI> has a more &s;trict allu&s;ion to the nature of the ob&s;truction, as when it proceeds from &s;omething &s;tuffing up the ve&s;&s;els. But none of the&s;e terms convey any &s;trict meaning, as they do not explain the manner of their action. The &s;tudent, therefore, ought not to be &s;atisfied, till he has carefully evolved them, and reduced the medi|cines, which have the&s;e terms applied to them, to their mo&s;t &s;imple action.</P>
<P>We now proceed to the terms employed in Chirurgical indications; and fir&s;t, of tho&s;e in cure of tumors. Here the fir&s;t indication is to di&s;cu&s;s or re&s;olve; hence the terms <HI>di&s;cutientia</HI> and <HI>re&s;olventia.</HI> Although I do not deny the ultimate effect of the&s;e, yet the terms are too complex, as comprehending medicines very various in their operations, as <HI>emollientia, anti&s;pa&s;modica,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Reprimentia, reper|cutientia, repellentia,</HI> are all &s;uppo&s;ed, by many, &s;ynonymous to <HI>a&s;tringentia,</HI> but they are too various in their operation to come under any one head; for though <HI>&s;acch. &s;aturni,</HI> oak bark, and opium, be all repellents, yet their manner of operation is very different. When a tumor can neither be repelled nor di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, our next indi|cation is to attempt &s;uppuration, which has given ri&s;e to the terms <HI>&s;uppurantia</HI> and <HI>maturantia.</HI> The&s;e terms are too general, and we ought to con&s;ider in what manner they bring about their effects, whether by operating on the &s;olids, or increa&s;ing the putre&s;cency of the fluids, and then give them names according to their mo&s;t &s;imple operation.</P>
<P>Suppuration being brought on, our next intention is to produce, or continue, good pus: Hence the term <HI>dige&s;tiva,</HI> which is equally complex with the former, and therefore ought to be &s;tudiou&s;ly evolved. Dige&s;tion often depends on keeping up a proper degree of inflammatory motion in the part, and frequently al&s;o on removing &s;ungo&s;ities. <HI>Detergentia, ab&s;tergentia, mundificantia, depurantia,</HI> are &s;ynonymous terms. <HI>Detergentia</HI> and <HI>ab&s;tergentia</HI> have been transferred to internal remedies, and applied to &s;uch as have the
<PB N="41" REF="014000_0047_0F92585F06D9E030">
power of wa&s;hing off, or de&s;troying vi&s;cidities adhering to the ve&s;&s;els, and carrying them off from the body; and therefore, in this &s;en&s;e, if there be any &s;uch, they are no other than <HI>attenuantia. Depurantia</HI> have been defined &s;uch medicines as clean&s;e the body, by promoting the excretion of the degenerated fluids; therefore, in this &s;en&s;e, they are &s;ynonymous to aperients and at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nuants.</P>
<P>The next indication commonly laid down by Chirurgical Writers, in the ca&s;e of ulcers, is to renew the &s;ub&s;tance, and they called me|dicines for this intention <HI>&s;arcotica.</HI> This indication is entirely imaginary, unle&s;s in &s;o far as it is applied to medicines which re|move ob&s;tacles to Nature's performing the operation, and therefore are nothing but detergents or ab&s;tergents. Another indication laid down by Surgeons, is to agglutinate or con&s;olidate; hence <HI>aggluti|nantia</HI> and <HI>con&s;olidantia,</HI> as though the&s;e medicines united the parts to which they are applied. But this indication is equally imaginary with the former, being entirely the work of nature; therefore bandages are the only applications which can a&s;&s;i&s;t here. The&s;e terms, <HI>agglutinantia,</HI> &amp;c. have been transferred to remedies given internally, and are then called <HI>vulneraria.</HI> This indication is likewi&s;e entirely the work of nature, for I know no agglutinants, and only two medicines which promote &s;uppuration, mercury and peruvian bark; and if writers on the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> do mean any thing by vulneraries, it is a&s;tringents, but they are unfitly called &s;o, a&s;trin|gents being never proper, nor are they indeed ever employed in &s;uch ca&s;es, at lea&s;t in this country, and if abroad, it is rather in compliance with a rotten practice, and to amu&s;e the patient.</P>
<P>The la&s;t indication in the cure of ulcers is to <HI>cicatrize,</HI> or draw a &s;kin on the part. The medicines &s;uppo&s;ed to an&s;wer this end are called <HI>epulotics</HI> and <HI>cicatrizers,</HI> but this is entirely an operation of nature, though <HI>charpie</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dry lint.</NOTE> or dry powders, may a&s;&s;i&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="014000_0048_0F92585FC2C8D848">
I am to mention &s;ome terms ari&s;ing from a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pecific pro|perty in the medicines: The&s;e were &s;uppo&s;ed of two kinds; I. Such as were &s;pecific to a certain part of the &s;y&s;tem; II. To particular di&s;ea&s;es. The fir&s;t divi&s;ion has been carried to great exce&s;s, as there is &s;carce a part of the &s;y&s;tem which has not had a medicine adapted to it; but at fir&s;t &s;ight this divi&s;ion mu&s;t appear fal&s;e, as there is no di&s;ea&s;e of any particular part that is not common to any other part of the &s;y&s;tem. I &s;hall now mention the terms of this fir&s;t divi&s;ion in my u&s;ual order, <HI>a capite as calcem.</HI> 1. <HI>Cephalics:</HI> By the&s;e are meant &s;uch medicines as are &s;uited to di&s;ea&s;es of the head; but the&s;e are very various, and often oppo&s;ite in their nature. By this term writers generally mean certain &s;ub&s;tances, which, by an agreeable odour and fragrancy, were grateful to the nerves at their origin in the head. If this were the ca&s;e, the term might be admitted: But I &s;hall afterwards &s;how, that little virtue depends on the odour; and all tho&s;e remarkable for their odour are &s;timulants. A term &s;ynonymous to cephalic, is, 2. <HI>Nervous;</HI> but this is &s;till more ambiguous and exten&s;ive in its &s;ignification, as comprehending medicines &s;uited to all nervous di&s;ea&s;es, <HI>e. g.</HI> &s;timu|lants, &s;edatives, anti&s;pa&s;modics. 3. <HI>Ophthalmics</HI> are medicines &s;uppo&s;ed to act &s;pecifically in di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes; but as medicines good for di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes are al&s;o equally efficacious for the &s;ame di&s;orders in any other part of the body, this term has no proper meaning. Some medicines, as <HI>euphra&s;ia,</HI> have been extolled as &s;pecifics here, but I know they have no title to any pre-eminence. 4. <HI>Pectorals, thoracics, pulmonics, pneumonics,</HI> are all terms applied to medicines &s;uited to di&s;ea&s;es in the brea&s;t, but not one of them has a &s;pecific virtue; for I imagine tho&s;e medicines which increa&s;e the bronchial mucus will al&s;o promote the &s;ecretion of mucus in any other part of the body. But writers in general mean, by pectorals, all tho&s;e medicines which promote or correct the bronchial mucus, two very oppo&s;ite effects, and therefore the terms are confounding. 5. <HI>Cardiacs.</HI> Cordials act in general on the nervous &s;y&s;tem, and not &s;pecifically on the heart. 6. <HI>Stomachics.</HI> Many of the&s;e medicines excite appetite and promote dige&s;tion, but they are of &s;uch different
<PB N="43" REF="014000_0049_0F925860C3EBF7A0">
kinds, and to be u&s;ed in &s;uch different circum&s;tances, that no &s;uch term ought to be admitted. With regard to the other abdominal vi&s;cera, the terms are applied with even le&s;s propriety than in the former. 7. <HI>Hepatic.</HI> This term &s;eems to have no meaning at all, as we cannot conceive any medicine has a &s;pecific operation on the liver preferable to any other part of the &s;y&s;tem. If any medicine more directly promoted &s;ecretion of bile, it might be called hepatic. Some &s;uch indeed have been &s;uppo&s;ed, but I am not acquainted with them. 8. <HI>Splenetics.</HI> This is &s;till more improper than the former. 9. <HI>Nephritics.</HI> It is po&s;&s;ible there may be medicines which act more directly on the kidneys, but it is only in &s;o far as they are diuretics. Nephritics are appropriated to di&s;ea&s;es of the kidneys, but they are here the &s;ame with demulcents, as they act by defending the kidney from the acrimony of the urine, and &s;harp points of the gravel. Nephritics have not only been &s;uppo&s;ed to act as diuretics, but al&s;o to pu&s;h out, and even di&s;&s;olve, &s;and or gravel; but we know none of this kind but &s;uch as are diuretics. 10. <HI>Uterines.</HI> This term is equally exceptionable with any of the former, for I doubt even if the <HI>menagoga</HI> act directly on the uterus. 11. <HI>Aphrodi&s;iaca:</HI> The medicines which act on the genitals, and &s;timulate to venery. I imagine this al&s;o a fal&s;e indication; for we know no medicines which do this by their immediate action on tho&s;e organs. Cantharides have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be of this kind, but they act only by being received into the blood, and &s;timulating the bladder, and &s;o communicating their effects to the organs of generation. There are other aphrodi&s;iacs, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to increa&s;e the &s;eminal turge&s;cency; but the&s;e are imaginary, for we know none but nutrients, which, by being long detained in the &s;y&s;tem, di&s;tend all the ve&s;&s;els, and the &s;eminal ve&s;icles al&s;o. 12. <HI>Antaphrodi&s;iacs.</HI> I can &s;ay, with more certainty, that this is an unmeaning indication.</P>
<P>II. We now come to con&s;ider &s;pecifics, with regard to particular di&s;ea&s;es. Many, di&s;&s;atisfied with the rea&s;onings of dogmatic Phy&s;i|cians, have been led into pur&s;uits of &s;pecifics: If this could be done
<PB N="44" REF="014000_0050_0F9258616FAA4158">
with &s;ucce&s;s it would certainly be very de&s;irable; but at this day I know no medicine who&s;e action I do not think I can explain by its an&s;wering a particular indication, which entirely de&s;troys the notions of a &s;pecific.</P>
<P>I &s;hall content my&s;elf with barely enumerating, in our u&s;ual order, the terms of &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pecifics, what we have already &s;aid &s;uper&s;eding a farther explanation: <HI>Anti epileptica, anti m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">aca, anti melancholica, anti hypochondriaca, anti catarrhalia, anti phthi&s;ica, anti hectica, anti cachectica, anti dy&s;enterica, anti icterica, anti &s;trumatica, anti &s;corbutica, anti podagrica, anti venerea, anti febrilia.</HI></P>
<P>We now proved to another divi&s;ion of terms ari&s;ing from &s;uper|&s;tition or fal&s;e notions.</P>
<P><HI>Anti magica, anti pharmaca, anti toxica, alexeteria, anti ga|lactophora, anti lactifera, or lactifuga, ebolica, ari&s;tolochica, abortiva, lithontriptica, catagmatica.</HI> I have put <HI>lithontriptica</HI> in this ca|talogue, though I allow there are &s;ome medicines which de&s;erve that name, as <HI>aq. calc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> and alkaline &s;alts; but the&s;e have been but lately found out, and as the term is u&s;ed in the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> Writers, it is improperly applied.</P>
<P>Thus far have I thought proper to treat of terms, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t your under&s;tanding of different Authors, and to guard you again&s;t their ambiguous and inaccurate expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Before proceeding to our immediate bu&s;ine&s;s we &s;hall mention two indications omitted in the catalogue; the fir&s;t <HI>erodentia,</HI> or medicines which de&s;troy the &s;imple fibres; &s;econdly, <HI>anthel|mintica:</HI> This indication is a proper one, as there are medicines which act &s;pecifically on worms, but it could not be introduced into my plan.</P>

<HEAD>NUTRIENTIA.</HEAD>
<P>Perhaps the whole of our &s;ubject might be divided into <HI>food</HI> and <HI>medicine.</HI> The fir&s;t is implied by the term <HI>nutrientia,</HI> which comprehends every thing u&s;ed by mankind in their daily food, as well the &s;ub&s;tances which are &s;trictly nutrient, as tho&s;e which are employed to <HI>obviate</HI> and <HI>correct</HI> the degeneracy to which the nouri&s;hment is liable. But more &s;trictly <HI>nutrientia</HI> are &s;uch &s;ub|&s;tances as are fitted by the vital power to be converted into our fluids and &s;olids, in order to &s;u&s;tain their growth and repair their daily wa&s;te. Here a que&s;tion ari&s;es, whether our &s;olids and fluids are formed from one common aliment, or out of a mixed, <HI>i. e.</HI> one containing a principle of nouri&s;hment &s;uited to each. The fir&s;t opinion appears to me the mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>All aliment differs in two particulars; fir&s;t, as it is already a&s;&s;imilated into the animal nature, or requires to be <HI>converted</HI> into it, by a particular proce&s;s of the animal oeconomy. Of the fir&s;t kind are all <HI>animal &s;ub&s;tances,</HI> which, if not &s;imilar, are nearly &s;o to our nature, and require only for that a&s;&s;imilation <HI>&s;olution</HI> and <HI>mixture.</HI> The &s;econd kind comprehends <HI>vegetables,</HI> which mu&s;t undergo &s;everal changes before they can be a&s;&s;imilated. But as the nouri&s;h|ment of all animals, even of tho&s;e who live on other animals, can originally be traced to the vegetable kingdom, it is plain that the principle of all nouri&s;hment is in vegetables, and that, therefore, we ought to begin with the&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>VEGETABLE ALIMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion that ari&s;es here is, What are the vegetables which are peculiarly appropriated for food? Perhaps there is no vegetable but what affords aliment to &s;ome animal. But I will venture to &s;ay, that in human aliment a choice is nece&s;&s;ary, and a di&s;tinction ought to be made. The fir&s;t di&s;tinction is, that tho&s;e vegetables which are of a mild, bland, agreeable ta&s;te, are proper
<PB N="46" REF="014000_0052_0F925870EDA637E0">
<HI>nouri&s;hment;</HI> while tho&s;e of an acrid, bitter, nau&s;eous nature are improper. Every body, <HI>en gros,</HI> will allow the truth of this. There are, however, &s;everal <HI>acrid</HI> &s;ub&s;tances that we u&s;e as food, but the mild, the bland, the agreeable, are in the large&s;t propor|tion in every vegetable; whereas the acrid, the bitter, the di&s;|agreeable enter in the lea&s;t quantity; which la&s;t, however, may prove nouri&s;hment, provided our &s;y&s;tem is capable of <HI>&s;ubduing</HI> their nature. Thus we &s;ee that &s;ome animals live on what is poi&s;onous to others, which &s;eems entirely owing to the particular <HI>confor|mation</HI> of the&s;e animals. Of all the&s;e animals the human body is mo&s;t delicate in the choice of its food, and the acrid, bitter, and di&s;agreeable can never be admitted as aliment. There, however, &s;eem &s;ome exceptions. Thus <HI>celeri</HI> and <HI>endive</HI> are u&s;ed in common food, both &s;ub&s;tances of con&s;iderable acrimony; but you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that when we u&s;e them, they are previou&s;ly blanched, which almo&s;t entirely deprives them of that &s;u&s;picious tendency. Or if we employ other acrid &s;ub&s;tances, we generally, in great mea&s;ure, deprive them of their <HI>acrimony</HI> by boiling. In different countries the &s;ame plants grow with different degrees of acrimony. Thus garlic here &s;eldom enters our food; but in the &s;outhern countries, where they grow more mild, they are frequently u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. Again, the plant which furni&s;hes <HI>ca&s;&s;ada,</HI> being very acrimonious, and even poi&s;onous in its recent &s;tate, affords an in&s;tance of the nece&s;&s;ity of preparation of acrid &s;ub&s;tances even in the&s;e countries; for by a particular management they allow the acrimonious juice to run off, and the farinaceous nutritious part of it is left behind. Upon the whole, therefore, I maintain, that we u&s;e no acrid &s;ub&s;tances in our food that are not previou&s;ly deprived of their acrimony; or, if we do, they are only employed as <HI>condimenta.</HI> But if the que&s;tion &s;till remain, if it is &s;till urged, that acrid &s;ub&s;tances <HI>are</HI> employed in our food, I alledge they are only &s;uch as the human body, by its particular <HI>conformation,</HI> is capable to &s;ubdue. Here then begins the divi&s;ion of plants, into food and medicine, the mild, the bland, the agreeable plants, or their parts, being fit for food; while the acrid, &amp;c. are proper for
<PB N="47" REF="014000_0053_0F925871324B59D8">
medicine. For this rea&s;on Linnaeus's aphori&s;ms are well founded, <HI>in&s;ipida &amp; inodora nutriunt, &s;apidiora non nutriunt.</HI> The rea&s;on is very obvious, for unle&s;s &s;ub&s;tances <HI>affect remarkably</HI> our organs of &s;en&s;e, they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to operate powerfully on our &s;y&s;tem. And this very effect of operating powerfully on our &s;y&s;tem, de&s;troys their <HI>expediency</HI> as food. Again, as &s;apid and odorous &s;ub&s;tances have the power of operating changes in our &s;y&s;tem, they mu&s;t act on the <HI>nervous power,</HI> the part chiefly changeable. The in&s;ipid and bland do, indeed, act on our fluids, but the changes they pro|duce mu&s;t be very <HI>&s;low.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall now enquire what part of the mild and bland &s;ub&s;tances con&s;titutes the <HI>proper</HI> aliment. In general, the more &s;weet &s;ub|&s;tances are all nutritious: The&s;e are little known here as food, but in the warmer climates make the greate&s;t part of it. We have now facts to prove, that &s;ugar alone is nutritious, and we &s;hall afterwards endeavour to prove, that all fruits we u&s;e are nutritious <HI>only from their &s;ugar.</HI> Here, the farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances are more evidently nutritious, as likewi&s;e the bland mucilaginous. The&s;e two are nearly connected with each other, and both with the <HI>&s;accharine</HI> &s;ub&s;tance; for all farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances, before maturity, are &s;weet, and, after maturity, can be re&s;tored to their &s;weet &s;tate by malting. Again, in fruits we ob&s;erve a change from &s;weet to farinaceous, which la&s;t property many of them attain upon maturity; and all fari|naceous &s;ub&s;tances, when mature, abound in oil; &s;o that it appears that the &s;accharine and oily part, blended together, make the mu|cilaginous and farinaceous matters, <HI>i, e.</HI> the intermediate &s;tates be|tween &s;ugar and oil; &s;o that I conclude, that &s;ugar and oil blended together, and forming the farinaceous &s;ub&s;tance, is the nutritious part of vegetables. You will now &s;ee what I formerly a&s;&s;erted, that either oil may enter into the nutritious &s;ub&s;tance, or that the nutri|tious &s;ub&s;tance, by animal proce&s;s, may afford oil.</P>
<P>We are next to con&s;ider on what the difference of nutritious &s;ub|&s;tances depend. This turns on two heads; 1. On the quantity of
<PB N="48" REF="014000_0054_0F925871C0E9A098">
nutriment each &s;ub&s;tance contains; 2. On its being more or le&s;s ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imilated.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="characteristic">
<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<P>This depends on two circum&s;tances; 1. On their containing the proportion of &s;ugar, or oil, or both; and that proportion even being given, it may depend al&s;o on the <HI>texture</HI> of the &s;ubject, which al|lows a quantity of nouri&s;hment more or le&s;s ea&s;ily to be extracted from it. Thus, <HI>e. g.</HI> if my &s;tomach extract from a plant, which contains a le&s;s proportion of nouri&s;hment than another, that nou|ri&s;hment more <HI>ea&s;ily,</HI> it will compen&s;ate for the quantity. As to the difference, with regard to the quantity of nouri&s;hment <HI>each &s;ub|ject affords,</HI> we refer that till we come to treat of each in particular.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="characteristic">
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<P>As to more or le&s;s ea&s;y a&s;&s;imilation. This difference ari&s;es not only from <HI>quality</HI> of the &s;ub&s;tance taken in, but al&s;o as often from its <HI>relation</HI> to the &s;tomach, or &s;tate of the animal organs. Nothing is more common, or more ridiculous, than to a&s;k whether this or that &s;ub&s;tance be whole&s;ome. As to the quantity, indeed, the an&s;wer might be ea&s;y; but as to quality it entirely depends on peculiarity of con&s;titution. The changes our aliments undergo, are of three kinds; 1. In re&s;pect of a&s;&s;imilation; 2. of &s;olution; 3. mixture.</P>
<P N="1">1. A&s;&s;imilation implies a change of the nature of the &s;ubject, which &s;pontaneou&s;ly is inclined to alterations, different from tho&s;e intended to be wrought by the a&s;&s;imilatory proce&s;s; <HI>e. g.</HI> all vege|tables are &s;pontaneou&s;ly ace&s;cent, and as there is nothing of that beyond the <HI>primae viae,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, that it &s;hould be <HI>overcome.</HI> Again&s;t this it may be objected, that vegetables are both ace&s;cent and alkale&s;cent; but I am ready to prove them all of the fir&s;t nature. Do vegetables then become acid previous to their undergoing any other change? I confe&s;s this is my opinion, though it is not the common one. For it is &s;uppo&s;ed, <HI>e. g.</HI> that
<PB N="49" REF="014000_0055_0F9258728AC60E80">
in the &s;tomach of a &s;trong healthy man the food in&s;tead of becoming acid, tends directly to the putrefactive fermentation. The arguments adduced in favour of this opinion are, 1. That an acid fermenta|tion cannot be carried on without a con&s;iderable admi&s;&s;ion of air, and that the &s;tomach, being a <HI>clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el,</HI> excludes the acce&s;s of that fluid; 2. That the heat of the &s;tomach is too <HI>great</HI> for the acetous proce&s;s; and, 3. That the admixture of the &s;pontaneou&s;ly pu|tre&s;cent animal fluids would be&s;ides <HI>obviate</HI> this ace&s;cency.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t objection, the &s;tomach is not the clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el alledged, for it admits a large quantity of <HI>air</HI> along with the food, &amp;c. Secondly, I have found, by accurate experiments, that the acetous fermentation can be carried on in a heat equal to that of the human body, I believe it even admits of the vinous; although I con|fe&s;s that it will be <HI>difficult</HI> to conduct the proce&s;s in &s;uch degree of heat, yet it may be done, and indeed it always does take place, although <HI>rapidly,</HI> and &s;oon terminating in the acetous proce&s;s. Third, as to this objection, Dr. Pringle, I think, has &s;ufficiently proved, that the admixture of animal fluids cannot hinder the acetous proce&s;s, but, on the contrary, that in certain proportion they promote it. None of the&s;e three circum&s;tances, therefore, are &s;ufficient to prevent the &s;pontaneous tendency of the vegetable aliment to acidity; and I am certain, from experiments, that the vegetable aliment fir&s;t turns acid in the &s;tomach; for every &s;tomach, human or brute, is always, on examination, found to have an acid pre&s;ent in it. Hence that ace&s;cency is not a di&s;ea&s;e, but a &s;tep towards a&s;&s;imilation: And if Phy&s;icians ob&s;erve di&s;ea&s;es proceeding from this cau&s;e, they ought to be attributed to the <HI>&s;tate</HI> and <HI>degree</HI> of it. As to the &s;tate or condition of it I think, it is this: Whenever the aliment enters into a high vinous fermentation, with copious generation of fixed air, commonly called <HI>gas &s;ilve&s;tre,</HI> as of the &s;ame nature with that produced in the ordinary vinous proce&s;s, it becomes a <HI>di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> and has the power of de&s;troying the <HI>mobility</HI> and <HI>contractility</HI> of the moving fibres, and even the tone of the &s;tomach it&s;elf, producing there flatulency and &s;pa&s;m from irre|gular

<PB N="50" REF="014000_0056_0F92587340C60750">
motions of the nervous power, and, at la&s;t, &s;tupor, lethargy, apoplexy, and death. This happens chiefly from fault of animal organs; for though it appears, by Pringle's experiments, that ani|mal fluids do not prevent fermentation, yet they have the power in their &s;ound &s;tate of moderating the <HI>generation of air.</HI></P>
<P>When acidity is a di&s;ea&s;e, it always depends on the above, and on the <HI>degree</HI> or quantity of it; for although I have &s;aid that acidity is nece&s;&s;ary, yet it &s;hould only be of &s;uch a degree as afterwards to be overcome by the mixture of the animal fluids. I have yet only mentioned the <HI>organs</HI> as the cau&s;e of acidity; but it al&s;o depends on the <HI>quantity</HI> of acid naturally in the vegetable, and its tendency to undergo the vinous fermentation. For the di&s;ea&s;e con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in acidity as in the <HI>vinous</HI> fermentation. For if we take in vegetable matters, after having undergone the vinous fermentation, their effects are not &s;o much to produce flatulency, but depend on the quantity of acid taken in. Hence farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances, naturally ace&s;cent, when leavened, <HI>impede,</HI> though not <HI>prevent,</HI> the generation of flatulencies; and hence the &s;ame quantity of <HI>vinegar</HI> does not produce equally bad effects, as of vegetable unfermented juices.</P>
<P>Acidity, as a di&s;ea&s;e, depends on the aliment; 1. As it contains a large proportion of &s;accharine matter. 2. When to that is joined a fre&s;h acidity, which renders it more liable to ferment. In&s;tances of this in the <HI>fructus acido dulces.</HI> 3. When, by a <HI>previous</HI> acci|dent it is put into a &s;tate of active vinous fermentation, and in its fermenting &s;tate is taken into the &s;tomach, as new wines, ales, &amp;c. The&s;e are the <HI>qualities</HI> that are apt to be mo&s;t hurtful in their con&s;equences. On the contrary, tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, which have under|gone fermentation, are le&s;s liable to produce bad effects, and only do &s;o from their quantity.</P>
<P>In the next place, this morbid tendency in the aliment depends on the &s;tate of the body, and chiefly on a weaker action of the
<PB N="51" REF="014000_0057_0F92587434943098">
&s;tomach (for I pa&s;s over the effects of the ga&s;tric liquors, as we are yet but little acquainted with them, and as the&s;e effects depend on the &s;tate of the &s;tomach.) To the more or le&s;s bri&s;k action of the &s;tomach, may likewi&s;e be referred the greater or le&s;s quantity of ga&s;tric liquor emulged, or &s;queezed out; and al&s;o in proportion to the weaker &s;tate of the &s;tomach, the food is longer retained there.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the circum&s;tances which &s;hould be in view, with regard to aliments, in different per&s;ons.</P>
<P>When the aliment is pu&s;hed into the <HI>inte&s;tines,</HI> its ace&s;cency is more certainly overcome by the addition of the bile, and a &s;upply of pancreatic and inte&s;tinal fluids, analogous to the <HI>&s;aliva</HI> and ga&s;tric liquor; and as the aliment never <HI>re&s;ts</HI> in the inte&s;tines, it is always expo&s;ed to mixture of new juices. Effects of the bile on the ali|ment are as yet little known. Vegetable acids change the bile in colour, con&s;i&s;tence, and ta&s;te, which la&s;t is &s;weet, and this mixture probably affords a new &s;timulus when the <HI>acidity</HI> prevails; and in this way our vegetable aliment <HI>&s;timulates</HI> the inte&s;tines, produces purging, and even a greater di&s;charge of choler it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It has been imagined by Phy&s;icians, that aliments differ in their <HI>effects</HI> on the bile, &s;ome <HI>encrea&s;ing</HI> its acrimony, &amp;c. but what they have &s;aid &s;eems to me loo&s;e and inaccurate. Whether there are &s;ub&s;tances which have different properties with regard to the bile. I dare not determine, and I think whatever is &s;aid by authors on this &s;ubject may be reduced to the greater or le&s;s acidity of the aliment.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid with regard to the a&s;&s;imi|lation of the aliment; we are next to treat of its <HI>&s;olubility.</HI> Solu|bility always depends on the <HI>more or le&s;s firm texture</HI> of the &s;ubject. We are apt to mi&s;take on this head; for animal &s;ub&s;tances, though &s;eemingly of more cohe&s;ion, are found, to be of ea&s;ier &s;olubility. Solubility, then, is more to be noted in vegetables than animals; thus the hu&s;ks of vegetables are of much more difficult &s;olubility
<PB N="52" REF="014000_0058_0F92587DAFA6B718">
than animal &s;ub&s;tances of apparently the &s;ame cohe&s;ion. In general, the &s;oft, pulpy, &amp;c. vegetable &s;ub&s;tances are ea&s;ily &s;oluble, and the tough, &amp;c. the contrary, and the&s;e are al&s;o the longer retained in the &s;tomach. Almo&s;t all vegetable &s;ub&s;tances employed in diet are &s;pecifically lighter than water, and con&s;equently than the ga&s;tric fluids; hence they will float near the cardia, and cau&s;e eructations. For &s;ome hours the&s;e firmer &s;ub&s;tances give no unea&s;ine&s;s, but afterwards begin to operate on the upper orifice of the &s;tomach. 2. The &s;olubility of our aliment is diver&s;ified according to firmne&s;s of texture; for, in proportion to the &s;olubility, two &s;ub&s;tances, con|taining equal quantity of nouri&s;hment, give more or le&s;s of it to the extracting powers, and in proportion to the quantity of nouri&s;hment extracted, more or le&s;s faeces are left. Vegetable aliments, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> give more faeces.</P>
<P N="3">3. With regard to the <HI>mixture</HI> of the aliment. Whenever the oil and watery parts of our aliment are <HI>naturally</HI> mixed, the &s;tomach does little. But commonly this is not the ca&s;e, and the oil and water &s;eparate in the &s;tomach, and mu&s;t be at lea&s;t in that vi&s;cus intimately confounded. This previous mixture need little to be regarded in &s;trong &s;tomachs, but in weak ones; in this ca&s;e the oil and water &s;eparate, the former floating near the upper orifice, and cau&s;ing unea&s;y &s;ymptoms. I have known many per&s;ons who&s;e eructations were purely oily, and would flame in the fire, and in|deed, this is the &s;tronge&s;t proof of a weak &s;tomach. Oil is liable to particular changes: Out of the body it checks fermentation, but is apt in weak &s;tomachs to turn rancid, and occa&s;ion heart-burn, a di&s;ea&s;e more frequent from this than any other cau&s;e. Not only is the aliment thus diver&s;ified, but the qualities of the food al&s;o often depend on peculiar &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;tomach, or idio&s;yncra&s;y, which here oftener occur than in any other part of the &s;y&s;tem, <HI>e. g.</HI> With re&s;pect to honey, though, indeed, I think, &s;ome rea&s;on may be given for this, &s;uch per&s;ons being often affected with it who are affected with acidity, as honey con&s;i&s;ts of acid and &s;ugar, the matter of fermentation. This &s;eems to be confirmed by &s;uch per&s;ons eating
<PB N="53" REF="014000_0059_0F92587DEBDF6E18">
it with impunity, when new, mixed with the comb, or when, by boiling, its air is di&s;&s;ipated, and its acid more intimately mixed with the &s;accharine part. I am not certain whether this theory be &s;ound, but though it <HI>be,</HI> it cannot extend to &s;pa&s;modic &s;ymptoms, &amp;c. produced by a &s;mall bit of egg, crab, &amp;c. which &s;ymptoms can only be explained from idio&s;yncra&s;y. The&s;e extraordinary in&s;tances lead me to &s;u&s;pect the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;tomach extends further than is &s;u&s;pected, and may be reckoned the cau&s;e of different ta&s;tes, &amp;c. The primary cau&s;e of the &s;tomach's &s;en&s;ibility &s;eems to be, that it may extend this &s;en&s;ibility over the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>That the &s;tomach is &s;en&s;ible to different degrees of &s;olubility and mixture, is evident from what has been already &s;aid. Thus, a quantity of warm water and oil is almo&s;t always thrown up. A &s;mall quantity of oil it&s;elf will produce this effect. The different &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;tomach will determine the &s;tay of the food in that organ. Hence peculiar flavours affect this longer or &s;horter &s;tay. To all the&s;e I have to add a peculiar effect of the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;tomach, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> whenever the &s;tomach is employed in dige&s;ting the aliment, it &s;eems to be an e&s;tabli&s;hed law of the animal oeconomy, that there is more or le&s;s fever excited during the time of dige&s;tion, nece&s;&s;ary, indeed, in &s;ome degree, but when it proceeds to a <HI>noxious</HI> one it ought to determine a change of our aliment. The&s;e preliminaries being &s;ettled, I proceed to talk of particular &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>With regard to the vegetable aliments, I have thrown them into three divi&s;ions. The fir&s;t comprehends all the different kinds of <HI>nutriment;</HI> the &s;econd the <HI>drinks;</HI> the third the <HI>condiments.</HI> Again, I have divided the foods according to the <HI>quantity</HI> of nutri|ment they afford, &s;etting them in the following order, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> fruits, herbs, roots, &s;eeds; thus giving the lea&s;t nouri&s;hing fir&s;t, &amp;c. This, however, is not &s;trictly true, as &s;ome fruits are more nouri&s;hing than certain herbs, or perhaps roots, &amp;c. but the&s;e exceptions &s;hall be marked as we go along. Fruits are &s;ubdivided into tho&s;e we eat <HI>fre&s;h,</HI> or tho&s;e we eat <HI>dry,</HI> or more concentrated. With regard to

the <HI>whole,</HI> I have not pretended to enumerate <HI>all</HI> the different kinds of aliment, as they differ in different countries; and as of many of them I have little or no experience: I &s;hall, therefore, confine my|&s;elf to tho&s;e known in this <HI>country,</HI> and from what application may be made to &s;uch as occur el&s;ewhere.</P>

Being of firmer texture they are of le&s;s ea&s;y &s;olution, apt to be retained longer in the &s;tomach, and, though le&s;s acid them&s;elves, are more apt to generate a noxious one. They
<PB N="55" REF="014000_0061_0F9258882028F0D0">
have the cooling virtues of acids, but are more to be taken notice of for their a&s;tringency, by both which qualities they dimini&s;h the peri&s;taltic motion of the inte&s;tines, retard the pa&s;&s;age of the aliment, and occa&s;ion an accumulation and retention of hardened faeces.</P>
<P N="2">2. ACIDITY. In moderate degree acids are grateful to the &s;tomach, and excite appetite. Directly as acid they are refrigerant, <HI>i. e.</HI> they weaken the active power of the animal fibres. This is not incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;timulating, which afterwards I &s;hall &s;hew is often combined with a refrigerant power in one and the &s;ame &s;ubject. Again, by weakening the &s;tomach, they weaken the whole &s;y&s;tem. The acid of vegetables is never pure, but commonly joined with a &s;weet, and therefore in &s;tomachs &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, is apt to produce there an active noxious fermentation.</P>
<P N="3">3. SWEETNESS. This is the only nutritious quality of vege|tables, and as &s;uch is perfectly innocent, but is liable al&s;o to bad effects from <HI>&s;pontaneous</HI> changes, which depend on its <HI>accompanying acid,</HI> and the <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> of the animal organs. All the&s;e have, in the inte&s;tines, a purgative quality, from the changes they produce on the bile, acerbity as <HI>acid,</HI> and &s;weetne&s;s as <HI>changed</HI> into an acid.</P>
<P N="4">4. TEXTURE. As of more aqueous and tender con&s;i&s;tence they are more readily di&s;&s;olved, and hence, perhaps, are more liable to fermentation. If of a very compact texture, by &s;taying longer in the &s;tomach, they, however, are apt to generate a &s;tronger acid.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the qualities of fruits; and one may judge from the ta&s;te what nature they will be of, the &s;tate of the &s;tomach being known. Let us then apply the&s;e general principles to the &s;tone fruits. The&s;e are of a &s;oft lax texture, and their juices dilute, by which means they are ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved in the &s;tomach, and for this rea&s;on they are apt to be taken in large quantities: As they are
<PB N="56" REF="014000_0062_0F925888589EFE68">
<HI>acido dulces,</HI> they are apt to ferment, perhaps more &s;o than any others, from the quantity &s;wallowed; hence they produce a copious acid, which irritating the inte&s;tines, cau&s;es diarrhoeas and cholera, taking their ri&s;e more frequently from this than any other cau&s;e. Upon the whole, I endeavour to a&s;&s;ign virtues in general, and I beg it may always be noticed, I except particular virtues: Thus there are plumbs of firmer texture, and therefore as little liable to ferment as firmer fruits.</P>
<P>Of the four following kinds of fruits, the PLUMB is mo&s;t refrigerant, and liable to ferment and produce <HI>cholera, diarrhoea,</HI> &amp;c. The CHER|RIES are commonly imagined le&s;s noxious, but to me there &s;eems little difference. The APRICOT is a &s;weeter, richer, and le&s;s noxious fruit. As to the PEACH, I have le&s;s experience: In tho&s;e countries where it comes to full maturity, it may be &s;afe, on account of the <HI>richne&s;s</HI> of its juice; but with us, its juice is poor, crude, and wa|tery, its ta&s;te acid, and almo&s;t acerb, its con&s;i&s;tence lax. Here, in general, we may ob&s;erve, that the later fruit is always the riche&s;t.</P>
<P>The ancients alledged, that the &s;tone fruits were di&s;po&s;ed to pro|duce fevers, an effect &s;eemingly oppo&s;ite to their qualities. This they do by their refrigerating power, and preventing dige&s;tion; and, perhaps, in tho&s;e countries, may be the primary exciting cau&s;e. It is imaginary, that &s;tones of fruits, &s;wallowed with them, prevent their bad effects, and may &s;ometimes be noxious, as they have been the foundation of &s;tony concretions, e&s;pecially if &s;wallowed unripe, with an acerb cru&s;t adhering to them; be&s;ides, this &s;hould not be confined to cherries, and, were it true, would extend to the other &s;tone fruits. Although I have mentioned only a few &s;tone fruits, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> &s;uch as occur here, they are, if found el&s;ewhere, of nearly the &s;ame qualities, and to be pre&s;umed of much the &s;ame virtues.</P>
<P>The next &s;et of fruits in the catalogue are APPLES and PEARS, the <HI>Pomaceae</HI> of Linnaeus. The&s;e have the common properties of the other fruits, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> being liable to acerbity, acidity, &amp;c. They are
<PB N="57" REF="014000_0063_0F9258898D8C3B30">
le&s;s dilute than the &s;tone fruit, have a le&s;s active acid, and &s;o are le&s;s liable to a noxious fermentation; but being of firmer texture, are longer detained in the &s;tomach, and &s;o produce a noxious acid. Apples are, in general, of a more firm texture, and le&s;s &s;oluble than pears: Some pears, indeed, are firmer than apples, but commonly, when ripe, are more pulpy; while apples, &s;wimming near the top, elude the action, and al&s;o, by irritating the cardia, produce unea&s;y &s;ymptoms. Again, <HI>pears</HI> have more of &s;weetne&s;s than apples, on account of which they are more nouri&s;hing, and, from the conjoin|ed acerbity, are le&s;s liable to active fermentation. Writers on the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> have a&s;cribed, without foundation, cardiac and pec|toral virtues to the&s;e fruits.</P>
<P>I had an idea of arranging here a natural order, called by Linnaeus <HI>He&s;perideae,</HI> which takes in more than are here mentioned; but their acid is &s;o pure that they ought to be con&s;idered as <HI>condimenta.</HI> I have &s;et down only the China oranges, which, from their &s;weetne&s;s, are certainly nutritive, but from their acidity they are &s;ubject to fermentation, and have, be&s;ides, the other qualities of &s;tone fruits.</P>
<P>The next mentioned are STRAWBERRIES and RASBERRIES, be|longing to the <HI>Sentico&s;ae</HI> of Linnaeus. The&s;e are very tender, and therefore ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved, pa&s;&s;ing off before a very active fermentation can take place, which likewi&s;e is prevented by their <HI>&s;weetne&s;s,</HI> which is greater than in &s;tone fruits; on all which accounts they are very innocent.</P>
<P>In cla&s;&s;ing all &s;ub&s;tances, after giving tho&s;e which belong to a natural order, I throw together the mi&s;cellaneous by them&s;elves, as here; the grapes, currants, goo&s;eberries.</P>
<P>CURRANTS, with us, may be always con&s;idered as an acid fruit, con&s;iderably dilute and very pulpy, when kept clear of the acerb
<PB N="58" REF="014000_0064_0F925889C54C2BB0">
hu&s;k; they have very little &s;weetne&s;s, very little nouri&s;hment, and are liable to all the bad qualities of &s;tone fruits.</P>
<P>GOOSEBERRIES are much &s;weeter, more nouri&s;hing, and more innocent, and without the hu&s;ks are very ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved, and readily evacuated, and, on account of their &s;weetne&s;s, are le&s;s &s;ubject to active fermentation.</P>
<P>GRAPES are a richer fruit, and preferred for the making of wines, as they contain a great quantity of &s;accharine matter; on which account they al&s;o are more nutritive than any we have mentioned, perhaps as much as the <HI>dates</HI> and figs afterwards to be taken notice of. In the unripe &s;tate they are acerb, in their middle &s;tate they are apt to ferment, when perfectly ripe, and taken in a moderate quantity, they are among the innocent fruits.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude what I have to &s;ay on the recent fruits, with &s;ome ob&s;ervations of the different method of u&s;ing them. We have al|ready ob&s;erved their effects when u&s;ed fre&s;h. Wherever we employ heat we change their qualities, di&s;&s;ipate their active acid, and di&s;|po&s;e them le&s;s to ferment. Thus acerb fruits, by the di&s;&s;ipation of their acid by boiling, &amp;c. are rendered more &s;o, and con&s;equently not &s;o liable to a noxious di&s;po&s;ition. Hence univer&s;ally, roa&s;ted or boiled fruits are &s;afer than fre&s;h. We commonly al&s;o join them with matters which di&s;po&s;e them le&s;s to an active fermentation. Thus milk, or, more properly, cream is often u&s;ed, having that effect from its oily nature. We &s;hall afterwards &s;ee what effect acids have in coagulating the milk. We al&s;o now commonly u&s;e aromatics, as pepper, which, by &s;timulating and invigorating the &s;tomach, by taking off &s;pa&s;ms, excited from <HI>gas &s;ylve&s;tre,</HI> and by their anti&s;eptic virtue, enable them to re&s;i&s;t fermentation, and prevent their bad effects. Wine is u&s;ed to obviate the bad effects of fruit, but this depends on its &s;pirituous part, and therefore pure &s;pirit, were it not
<PB N="59" REF="014000_0065_0F92588AA7A3DB90">
otherwi&s;e noxious, would be mo&s;t eligible. If wine be u&s;ed it &s;hould be &s;trong, and &s;uch as has undergone its fermentation, and is ripe and mellow. Another method &s;till of u&s;ing them is with &s;ugar. This &s;urely renders fruit more nutritive; whether it prevents fermen|tation may be doubted; but, as I have ob&s;erved, that &s;weet fruits are &s;afe&s;t, &s;o mu&s;t a moderate addition of &s;ugar to acid fruits; in or|der to &s;upply their want of native &s;weet, &s;ometimes we u&s;e oily mat|ters, as butter in apple pie. This is a very proper, though le&s;s u&s;ual addition, from its antifermentative quality. But in a weak &s;tomach, where the inquiline humours are le&s;s in quantity, and le&s;s &s;apona|ceous, the oil is apt to &s;eparate, and produce ill con&s;equences, as heart-burn, &amp;c. as we have formerly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>It has been a que&s;tion agitated among Phy&s;icians, whether fruits are &s;afer before or after meals. The an&s;wer of this &s;eems to depend on a knowledge of the &s;tomach. In a weak &s;tomach they are more apt to be noxious when empty, than when di&s;tended with animal food. Here likewi&s;e they cannot be taken in &s;uch quantity as to hurt. In &s;trong &s;tomachs there is little difference; there they would &s;eem to promote appetite. In weak &s;tomachs, even when full, if taken in too great quantity, they may be very hurtful, by encrea&s;|ing the active fermentation of the whole. The ancients alledged, that the mild fruits &s;hould be taken before, and the acerb after meals, as being fitter to brace up the &s;tomach, and promote dige&s;tion. And, indeed, if taken in moderate quantity, the rule may hold true.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if you ob&s;erve the effect of the four qualities, acerbity, &amp;c. you are then in a condition to judge of the&s;e and any other wherever they occur.</P>

I have &s;aid that &s;ugar it&s;elf was nutritive; nay, indeed, the very principle of nouri&s;hment, of which we have various proofs: Thus the Negroes employed in the &s;ugar manufacture live almo&s;t &s;olely on this, and fatten exceedingly. Another chief proof is, from the fruits which I am to &s;peak of, which are remarkably fattening, but chiefly in their dried &s;tate. Again, birds, in fruit time, when the fruits are ripe, increa&s;e in fatne&s;s; and at &s;uch time, Dr. Robin&s;on has ob&s;erved, that their livers are enlarged; whence we &s;ee how fat people are &s;o much &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es of the vi&s;cera, e&s;pecially the liver.</P>
<P>The dried fruits I am to treat of, are the grape, date, and fig. They have the common properties of ripe fre&s;h fruits, but are not joined with &s;o powerful an acid, part of it being di&s;&s;ipated in drying. Hence they are le&s;s liable to run into active fermentation; but if taken in too great quantities, they will run into that, and the acid produced will have all the bad effects of fre&s;h fruits, in producing <HI>diarrhoeae, cholera,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing of the dried fruits; they contain a large portion of &s;accharine matter, united with mucilage. From their containing much &s;ugar, and from being vi&s;cid and le&s;s readily per&s;pired, they are more fit for nouri&s;hment. They are al&s;o, from their &s;ugar and mucilage, u&s;ed as demulcents, as their juice is mo&s;t fit for covering acrimony. The date and rai&s;in were formerly u&s;ed in this intention: The fir&s;t is now laid a&s;ide, but we retain the rai&s;in as giving a grateful acidity to the too lu&s;cious ta&s;te of the fig. The fig is al&s;o nephritic from its demulcent quality. They have been &s;aid to produce lice, but there is no foundation for believing this, either from information, or from our experience of them in this country. It is true, that in their native country they make the chief food of the poore&s;t people, who are generally dirty, and this may have given ri&s;e to the opinion.</P>

Although cucumber is neither &s;weet nor acid, yet it is con&s;iderably ace&s;cent, and &s;o produces flatulency, <HI>cholera, diarrhoea,</HI> &amp;c.

I have &s;een them di&s;charged with little change from the &s;tomach, after being detained there for forty-eight hours. By this means, therefore, their acidity is greatly encrea&s;ed. Hence oil and pepper, the condiments commonly employed, are very u&s;eful to check their fermentation. We have lately u&s;ed another condi|ment, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the &s;kin, which is bitter, and may, therefore, &s;upply the place of aromatics.

<P>Nothing is more common than the opinion that all the&s;e <HI>olera</HI> are of a nitrous quality.

entirely to the herb, for the root is very &s;weet, and, according to Margraaf's experiments, contains a larger proportion of &s;ugar than any other root he examined. But the nature of this will be better under&s;tood when we come to &s;peak of roots.</P>
<P><HI>Bra&s;&s;ica:</HI> The&s;e belong to an order of plants much u&s;ed in food. Their general character is, that they are remarkably acrid, but not poi&s;onous; on the contrary, their acrimony is of con&s;i|derable u&s;e in medicine, and in their bland &s;tate, being deprived of this acrimony in boiling, they are u&s;ed in food. Hence I took the general rule, that all our aliment is remarkably bland, and that the acrimonious part has little &s;hare in it: Of the&s;e we only u&s;e the <HI>bra&s;&s;ica</HI> and turnep as food, the others only as condiment. <HI>Bra&s;&s;ica</HI> is mo&s;t frequent in u&s;e, and of this there are many varieties, as colewort, cauliflower, brocoli, &amp;c. All the&s;e are &s;en&s;ibly &s;weet, and therefore more nutritious than mo&s;t of the herbaceous kind. The di&s;tinction we make of them depends mo&s;tly on their texture. Formerly we only employed the colewort, which has given place to the more tender &s;avoy; and perhaps this la&s;t will give way to the &s;till tenderer cauliflower. Tho&s;e of the <HI>bra&s;&s;ica</HI> kind are more flatulent than the <HI>oleraceae,</HI> as having more of a &s;accharine quality, which enables them to ferment, and, by this means, to produce an acid in the &s;tomach. I believe they produce the&s;e effects in a milder degree, in proportion to the richne&s;s of their &s;weet, and tenderne&s;s of texture. On this account cabbage is rendered more flatulent, and hence a confirmation of the general rule, that flatulency is mo&s;t owing to firmne&s;s of texture: Thus cabbage it&s;elf, when very young, is tender, and le&s;s flatulent, than when full grown.</P>

the re&s;t; it may, however, be broke down into a fine meal. With water, it forms the mo&s;t gluey vi&s;cid &s;ub&s;tance of any of the <HI>farinaceae,</HI> therefore &s;hould be well opened by fermentation, to make it fit for tender &s;tomachs. In our trials we have never been able, when we imported it in times of &s;carcity, to make it undergo &s;uch a fermentation as to have the friability of our grains.</P>

<HEAD>BUCK WHEAT.</HEAD>
<P>This is a farinaceous &s;eed, but does not belong to the &s;ame cla&s;s with the former. It is employed as food in this country now very rarely. It is u&s;ed for &s;ome other purpo&s;es, particularly to give a thick mucilage, of u&s;e to give tenacity to yarn in weaving, for which purpo&s;e it an&s;wers better than oats, barley, or wheat. I am led to make the &s;ame ob&s;ervations on it as the maiz, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that it is a hard, vi&s;cid, le&s;s &s;oluble &s;ub&s;tance than any of the other grains. It cannot be reduced to a fine enough meal. If we could open it by fermentation, it might be u&s;eful in food.</P>
<P>Having thus treated of the principal &s;pecies of the <HI>farinacea,</HI> I now come to their preparations. By much the mo&s;t common of the&s;e is bread, and without &s;omewhat of this form no nations &s;eem to live. Thus the Laplanders, having no corn of their own, make a &s;ort of bread of their dried fi&s;hes and of the inner rind of the pine, which &s;eems to be u&s;ed not &s;o much for their nouri&s;hment as for &s;upplying a dry food. For this mankind &s;eem to have an univer&s;al appetite, rejecting bland, &s;lippery, mucilaginous foods. This is not com|monly accounted for, but &s;eems to depend or very &s;imple principles. The preparation of our food depends on the mixture of the animal fluids in every &s;tage. Among others the &s;aliva is nece&s;&s;ary, which requires dry food as a nece&s;&s;ary &s;timulus to draw it forth, as bland, &s;lippery fluid aliments are too inert, and make too &s;hort &s;tay in the mouth to produce this effect, or to cau&s;e &s;ufficient degree of man|ducation to emulge that liquor. For this rea&s;on we u&s;e commonly dry bread along with animal food, which otherwi&s;e would too
<PB N="77" REF="014000_0083_0F92589E5B550A30">
quickly be &s;wallowed. For blending the oil and water of our food, nothing is &s;o fit as bread, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a previous manducation. For which purpo&s;e bread is of like nece&s;&s;ity in the &s;tomach, as it is proper, that a &s;ub&s;tance of &s;olid con&s;i&s;tence &s;hould be long retained there. Now I have &s;aid that the animal fluids mu&s;t be mixed with our aliments, in order to change the ace&s;cency it undergoes. But liquid foods would not attain this end, whereas the &s;olid &s;timulates and emulges the glands of the &s;tomach. The bread then appears to be exceedingly proper, being bulky without too much &s;olidity, and firm without difficulty of &s;olution. Although the bread I here men|tion only of our own <HI>farinacea,</HI> yet in different countries others are u&s;ed, as &s;ago, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Bread is of two kinds, leavened or unleavened, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;ubjected to fermentation, or only &s;imple dough made or water. Leavened bread is of two kinds; fir&s;t, as made of dough &s;et to ferment naturally, and afterwards employed as a ferment to other dough; &s;econdly, where we employ a ferment of vinous liquors. The fir&s;t is a pre|carious uncertain operation in it&s;elf, and more e&s;pecially &s;o in its application to a fre&s;h ma&s;s of unfermented dough. This is the method u&s;ed in the &s;outhern countries of Europe. The yea&s;t u&s;ed in the &s;econd more preferable method is a more active ferment, and le&s;s liable to accident than the leaven, even although it is &s;ubject to be u&s;ed too old, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o we find Briti&s;h bread better rai&s;ed than the French and more &s;pungy; but it has a di&s;advantage, e&s;pe|cially to &s;trangers, from the di&s;agreeable bitterne&s;s of hops often tainting our yea&s;t, and &s;o the bread as formed with it. The ad|vantages of leavened bread are to promote a&s;&s;imilation and &s;olution.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, all vegetable food becomes naturally more or le&s;s ace&s;cent, and it is the mode of this that forms a di&s;ea&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> when the vinous fermentation takes place. Indeed, I al&s;o own, that di&s;ea&s;e may &s;ometimes depend on the quantity of acid produced. One way of obviating the vinous fermentation is, by giving our food &s;omewhat of the acetous tendency, or throwing into the &s;tomach
<PB N="78" REF="014000_0084_0F9258A22D4B7198">
&s;omewhat to have this effect. Unfermented, or too little fermented bread, will cau&s;e heart-burn; when too acid from over fermenta|tion it will purge. This then explains the u&s;e of bread, and the degree of leavening nece&s;&s;ary, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that it &s;hould not be &s;o much leavened as to purge, but &s;ufficiently &s;o, in order to check the noxious vinous fermentation. The more ace&s;cent grains, as barley and rye, are more e&s;pecially purgative, and the hu&s;ks of all grain are &s;omewhat of this nature, while the pure farina has lo&s;s of it. Thus then the fine&s;t bread will be lea&s;t purgative, and the coar&s;e&s;t mo&s;t certainly &s;o. So far as to the a&s;&s;imilation, now with regard to the &s;olution.</P>
<P>In all bodies there is blended a certain quantity of air, and nothing promotes &s;olution more than the extrication of this air, which is particularly effected by fermentation. Application of heat, of a men&s;truum applied, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would be of little avail, unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a fermentation going on in the &s;tomach, which is particularly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by bread, which, be&s;ides the advantages of &s;olidity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is of u&s;e, as having its own texture already opened, to prove a ferment to other food. Bread is nece&s;&s;arily in a &s;olid and dry form, and hence is le&s;s &s;oluble. To prevent this, and at the &s;ame time pre&s;erve the &s;olid form, is the purpo&s;e of baking. To make the bread cohere, water is u&s;ed, and there is no greater &s;ecret in the art of baking than the quantity of this u&s;ed, which, if too great, makes the whole concrete into a firm in&s;oluble ma&s;s. Here we are apt to be deceived, as meal, like clay, will ab&s;orb a con&s;iderable quantity, and &s;till retain its mealy form. This mixture mu&s;t be made not with gentle &s;tirring, but accurate kneading, in order to make a &s;mall quantity of water &s;uffice; for if gentle mixture were u&s;ed, it, like the clay before-mentioned, would take in too much water, before it would cohere. After the mixture is made, we proceed to drying, which mu&s;t be performed &s;uddenly, all &s;low drying giving to &s;ub|&s;tances a tough compact form, while &s;udden drying gives a &s;pongy porous texture. This is illu&s;trated in making of paper, which, &s;lowly dried, is of fine compact texture; whereas, if taken &s;ud|denly
<PB N="79" REF="014000_0085_0F9258A357E1E828">
from the mill, it is porous, &s;inking, and &s;pungy. Hence we can apprehend what are the qualities of bread properly dried; for the water, interpo&s;ed as a gluten, is di&s;&s;ipated, and leaves the bread in a con&s;iderable degree of friability. Its friability depends al&s;o on the finene&s;s of the meal, and quality of the ferment applied, ren|dering it fit for manducation and &s;olution in the &s;tomach: Hence the difference between new bread and &s;tale; the latter being more friable, and more ea&s;ily &s;oluble, is preferable, provided it has got none of the putrefactive taint: However, in &s;trong &s;tomachs, this may too ea&s;ily be di&s;&s;olved and dige&s;ted, and therefore, in &s;uch ca&s;es, the other is to be cho&s;en.</P>
<P>As to unleavened bread, which is u&s;ed both here and in many other parts of Europe; this nece&s;&s;arily comes into a firm and tough cake, not having the advantage of fermentation to extricate the air. On account of this clo&s;ene&s;s of texture, it will retain the water more tenaciou&s;ly: Hence the rea&s;on of the different form of un|leavened bread being made out into thin cakes to favour their dry|ing, which the more expeditiou&s;ly it is done, for rea&s;ons already a&s;&s;igned, without burning, it is the more &s;oluble, friable, and po|rous. People obliged to u&s;e unleavened bread, have thought of adding butter, to render it more friable; but from this, perhaps, it is le&s;s mi&s;cible with the watery fluids, and tho&s;e in the &s;tomach; and hence, as we have &s;aid, it is more ace&s;cent, and apt to produce heart-burn. We al&s;o &s;ometimes u&s;e bread leavened to a very great degree, under the name of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our cakes. The&s;e are made by adding a good deal of water to give them vi&s;cidity, that they may be thinly extended. To obviate the effects of this vi&s;cidity, they are ren|dered proportionably more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our, on which account, when taken in con&s;iderable quantities, they are purgative. So far with regard to bread.</P>
<P>We now proceed to the other preparations of <HI>farinacea.</HI> The&s;e, when made into pa&s;te with water, and expo&s;ed to a heat capable of coagulating our fluids, are hardened into indi&s;&s;oluble ma&s;&s;es; but
<PB N="80" REF="014000_0086_0F9258A540988AC8">
when they are mixed with cold water, and afterwards expo&s;ed to a gradual heat, their &s;olution is effected. This is illu&s;trated by the preparation of ha&s;ty-pudding and water-gruel. The fir&s;t practice is the mo&s;t common, probably from being more &s;olid and longer retained in the &s;tomach, till it undergoes the proper ace&s;cent changes, while the water-gruel is little con&s;idered as a food, but rather as a drink, becau&s;e it pa&s;&s;es quickly off. All the puddings are analogous in their preparation to the ha&s;ty-pudding. The <HI>farinacea</HI> prepared by coagulation are of three kinds, pudding, pancake, and baken pa&s;te; pudding is of two kinds as made of flour or bread. The fir&s;t is coagulated into a firm ma&s;s, which we &s;hould not be able to di&s;&s;olve unle&s;s mixed with other matters, as &s;uet; on the contrary, that made of bread, &s;till remains, after being drenched with water, ea&s;ily &s;oluble. The&s;e are the common forms of pudding, though &s;ometimes they are made of grain, as rice, millet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In this ca&s;e the grain is fir&s;t boiled, and then dried to a proper con&s;i&s;tence, and mixed with variety of &s;ub&s;tances. In all of the&s;e forms milk is commonly u&s;ed rather than plain water, as giving a le&s;s tough con&s;i&s;tence. Eggs are al&s;o u&s;ed to obviate ace&s;cency, as being of animal nature. 2. Pancakes. Here &s;omewhat of a firm texture is required, and they are made out into thin plates for the &s;ame rea&s;on as the unleavened cakes. More water is nece&s;&s;ary to give them tenacity, and butter is added to pre|vent fermentation. 3. Pa&s;te. This is &s;ometimes made of fer|mented bread, but ordinarily of flour. As it is to be converted into various forms, it is made con&s;iderably tenacious. This is done by adding a large quantity of water, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low drying, and other means. It would, therefore, be very hard without the addition of butter, and, after all, it is very indige&s;tible, and apt to produce heart|burn and ace&s;cency. Perhaps this is increa&s;ed by the burned butter, from a certain &s;en&s;ibility in the &s;tomach, which occa&s;ions all empyreumatic oils to be long retained, and &s;o turn rance&s;cent and acid.</P>

<HEAD>LEGUMINA.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e are unctuous and oily, and have the oil intimately blended with a &s;accharine matter, &s;o that they afford a pure and &s;trong nouri&s;hment; and that they do &s;o appear from experiments made on dome&s;tic animals. It is ob&s;erved too that &s;ervants, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> living on low grounds, where the <HI>legumina</HI> grow in great plenty, and are their chief food, fatten remarkably, and then when tran&s;|ported to the higher ground, they turn weak and lean, living mo&s;tly on the <HI>culmiferous farinacea,</HI> and &s;ometimes cannot recover them without having recour&s;e to the former diet. That the <HI>legumina</HI> are intended for food, a curious rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned. The <HI>culmiferous,</HI> indeed, are intended for food, but the &s;ame ground cannot produce them above one or two years without being exhau&s;ted; whereas the <HI>legumina</HI> have no &s;uch effect, and interpo&s;ed between the culmiferous crops, make the&s;e be borne more ea&s;ily: And thus I have known a field, by alternate crops of the <HI>culmiferae</HI> and <HI>legumina,</HI> after twenty-four years, without any particular manure, capable to produce the &s;ame crop of <HI>culmiferae</HI> as at fir&s;t. This practice is very ancient, and therefore <HI>legumina</HI> very early mu&s;t have made a part of food.</P>
<P><HI>Legumina</HI> are of a more firm texture and le&s;s &s;oluble, therefore their u&s;e in food &s;hould be confined to the hardy robu&s;t farmer. They are more flatulent than mo&s;t vegetables, at lea&s;t than the <HI>farinacea.</HI> This depends not merely on that quantity of &s;accharine matter (which appears to be con&s;iderable, as appears from the rich &s;weet procurable from them) as the bad effects of this are obviated by its intimate mixture with their oil, but on the great quantity of air there is lodged in that texture, and which, during their fermenta|tion, is copiou&s;ly extricated; and hence they are improper aliment for weak &s;tomachs. They are u&s;ed in two different &s;tates, not only when fully ripe, (their effects in which ca&s;e I have ju&s;t now mentioned,) but al&s;o when very tender and green, at which time

they have not attained the oil they afterwards gain, approach in their qualities to other <HI>olera,</HI> and are hardly more &s;en&s;ibly flatulent than the&s;e; but after all, in compen&s;ation for the&s;e properties, their nutriment is proportionably dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the Catalogue I have only &s;et down of the <HI>legumina,</HI> peas, beans, and French beans, though many more of the &s;ame kind might have been added, as lentils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but they are purpo&s;ely omitted, as all of the &s;ame qualities, and I have only mentioned the three mo&s;t com|monly u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>pha&s;eoli,</HI> or French beans, are here little known in their mature &s;tate, but are u&s;ed with their cod in the manner of <HI>olera,</HI> than which they are &s;omewhat more firm and more nutritious.

<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t agreeable of the nuts, but are no where pro|duced in &s;uch quantity as to afford a food.

The farina and oil of it are ex|actly the &s;ame, but its bitter makes it &s;u&s;picious, as the laurel bitter, afterwards to be mentioned, may be procured from it, and as it is a poi&s;on to many animals. Some men, indeed, u&s;e them with impu|nity, but I think it a dangerous practice. They are, however, de|prived of this acrimony by heat, and hence are u&s;ed in baking; but we &s;hould not from this infer, that the u&s;e of them, when fre&s;h, is allowable.</P>

<HEAD>CACAO NUTS.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e contain the large&s;t proportion of oil, and thence are hardly u&s;ed without preparation, by mixing the oily with the farinaceous part, and on the accuracy of this mixture the quantity of their nouri&s;hment depends, as well as its ea&s;ine&s;s of dige&s;tion. The cho|colate made in Portugal and Spain is not near &s;o well prepared as the Engli&s;h, depending, perhaps, on the machine employed here, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the double cylinder, which &s;eems very well calculated for exact triture. If perfectly prepared, no oil appears on the &s;olution. London chocolate gives up no oil like the foreign, and it al&s;o may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, depend on the thickne&s;s of the preparation. The &s;olution requires more care than is commonly imagined. It is proper

to break it down, and di&s;&s;olve it thoroughly in cold water, by mill|ing with the chocolate &s;tick. If heat be applied, it &s;hould be done &s;lowly; for if &s;uddenly, the heat will not only coagulate it, but &s;eparate the oil, and therefore much boiling after it is di&s;&s;olved is hurtful. Chocolate is commonly required by people of weak &s;tomachs, but often rejected for want of proper preparation.

<P>The&s;e might be referred to the head of Condiment, and they are even u&s;ed only picked in tho&s;e countries where they are native, and their di&s;agreeable bitter is by this means corrected. I only mention them here, on account of the oil they afford &s;o copiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>I formerly &s;tarted a que&s;tion about the u&s;e of oil, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Whether oil was nece&s;&s;ary for nouri&s;hment, or only for &s;upplying the great quantity of oil in the &s;y&s;tem? Though the latter opinion be granted, yet I imagine oils are al&s;o directly nutritive, being copi|ou&s;ly mixed and intimately blended with the other parts of our aliment, and thus con&s;tituting a part of the proper nutritious fluid. They are al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary for a&s;&s;imulation; for the ace&s;cency of the <HI>fructus acido dulces</HI> would be difficultly &s;ubdued without the&s;e. Hence the u&s;e of oil and butter is almo&s;t as univer&s;al, and as nece&s;|&s;ary, as that of the <HI>farinacea.</HI> They give an aliment which approaches mo&s;t to that obtained from animal food. They give a more den&s;e ela&s;tic blood, and probably, too, a more putre&s;cent one than vegetables. Their vi&s;cidity al&s;o remains in &s;ome degree in the blood ve&s;&s;els, on which account we &s;hall mention them under the cla&s;s of medicines. Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, in his <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory of Aleppo,</HI> tells us, <Q>that in certain &s;ea&s;ons, when they u&s;e a great quantity of oil there, they are then di&s;po&s;ed to &s;omewhat of fever, with remarkable infarction of the lungs, which &s;ymptoms wear off on

retrenching the u&s;e of oil.</Q> Con&s;idered as aliment, oil is diffi|cultly per&s;pired, the meaning of which &s;hall be afterwards explained. The&s;e are the properties in general of our oily nouri&s;hment, whether oil or butter. Here a que&s;tion ari&s;es, Whether the Northern or Southern countries are &s;upplied with the mo&s;t agreable &s;ub&s;tance of this kind? With regard to butter, it has always a quantity of animal mucllage mixed with it, and hence is ea&s;ier mi&s;cible with water. But hence, although from the mu&s;cilage it receive con|&s;i&s;tence and &s;omewhat of mi&s;cibility with water, and hence more ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, yet from this very mixture it is more rance&s;cent, and does not keep &s;o long fre&s;h as oil, and hence produces di&s;orders in the <HI>primae viae.</HI> In the Southern countries oil is procured little di&s;po&s;ed to rance&s;cency, and therefore, where it can be u&s;ed per|fectly fre&s;h, it is not &s;o apt to produce rance&s;cent di&s;orders as butter. But here it is not &s;o equal advantage, and I never &s;aw any in this country but had &s;ome degree of rancidity, and therefore, we ought not in any ca&s;e, to prefer the imported oils to good fre&s;h butter. However, as fre&s;h oil is certainly eligible, and as almonds, who&s;e oil is better than that of olives, afford it but in incon&s;iderable quan|tity, I think we ought, as we have native &s;eeds which will afford a pure oil in pretty large quantity, to endeavour to procure it from them.</P>

<HEAD>DRINK.</HEAD>
<P>The general u&s;e of drink is to &s;upply fluid, facilitate &s;olution, in con&s;equence of that to expede the evacuation of the &s;tomach, and promote the progre&s;s of the aliment through the inte&s;tines; for, by the contraction of the longitudinal fibres of the &s;tomach, the <HI>pylorus</HI> is drawn up, and nothing but fluid can pa&s;s, which, by its bulk, makes a hurried progre&s;s through the inte&s;tines, and &s;o determines a greater excretion by &s;tool, as le&s;s than can be ab&s;orbed by the lacteals. Hence a large quantity of common water has been found purgative, and, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> that aliment which is accompanied with the large&s;t proportion of drink, makes the large&s;t evacuation by
<PB N="87" REF="014000_0093_0F9258AA3359A910">
&s;tool. Here a que&s;tion has ari&s;en, about where the feculent part of the aliment is fir&s;t remarkably collected? It is commonly thought to be in the great guts, but undoubtedly it often begins in the lower part of the <HI>ileum,</HI> e&s;pecially when the drink is in &s;mall proportion, and when the progre&s;s of the aliment is &s;low; for when the con|tents of the guts are very fluid, they are quickly pu&s;hed on, and reach the great guts before they depo&s;it any feculency. Another effect of drink is, to facilitate the mixture of the lymph, refluent from every part of the &s;y&s;tem, with the chyle. In the blood-ve&s;&s;els, where all mu&s;t be kept fluid, in order to proper mixture, drink increa&s;es the fluidity, and gives ten&s;ion, by its bulk, without concomitant acrimony or too much ela&s;ticity, and &s;o &s;trength and o&s;cillatory motion; Hence drink contributes to &s;anguification, as &s;ometimes food gives too den&s;e a nutriment to be acted upon by the &s;olids; and hence al&s;o we can &s;ee how drink promotes the &s;ecretions. The&s;e are the effects of drink in general; but what I have &s;aid mu&s;t be taken with &s;ome limitations, for the more liquid the food, it is &s;ooner evacuated, and le&s;s nouri&s;hment is extracted: Hence drink is, in &s;ome degree, oppo&s;ed to nouri&s;hment, and &s;o, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> tho&s;e who u&s;e lea&s;t drink are mo&s;t nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>All the effects of drink above-mentioned are produced by &s;imple water, and it may be &s;aid, that other liquors are fit for drink in proportion to the water they contain. Water, when u&s;ed as drink, is often impregnated with vegetable and farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances, but, as drinks, the&s;e impregnations are of little con&s;equence; they add, indeed, a little nouri&s;hment, but this is not to be regarded in a healthy &s;tate. Sometimes we impregnate water with the <HI>fructus acido dulces,</HI> and then, indeed, it acquires other qualities of con&s;i|derable u&s;e in the animal oeconomy. All drinks, however, may be reduced to two heads, fir&s;t, pure water, or where the additional &s;ub&s;tance gives no additional virtue; &s;econdly, into the <HI>fermentatae.</HI> Of the fir&s;t we have already treated, and the latter have not only the qualities of the fir&s;t, but al&s;o qualities peculiar to them&s;elves.</P>

Fermented liquors are more or le&s;s poignant to the ta&s;te, and better calculated to quench thir&s;t. Thir&s;t may be owing to various cau&s;es; fir&s;t, to defect of fluid in the &s;y&s;tem, which occa&s;ions a &s;canty &s;ecretion in the mouth, fauces, and &s;tomach; the dryne&s;s of the mouth and fauces will al&s;o, in this ca&s;e, be increa&s;ed, by their continual expo&s;ure to perpetual flux and reflux of the evaporating air; &s;econdly, thir&s;t depends on a large proportion of &s;olid vi&s;cid food; thirdly, on an alkale&s;cent aliment, e&s;pecially if it has attained any thing of the putrefactive taint; fourthly, on the heat of the &s;y&s;tem; but this &s;eems to operate in the &s;ame manner as the fir&s;t cau&s;e, giving a &s;en&s;e of dryne&s;s from its di&s;&s;ipation of the fluids. The fermented liquors are peculiarly adapted for obviating all the&s;e cau&s;es, &s;timulating the mouth, fauces, and &s;tomach, to throw out the <HI>&s;aliva</HI> and ga&s;tric liquor by their poignancy; by their ace&s;cency they are fitted to de&s;troy alkale&s;cent acrimony, to quench thir&s;t from that cau&s;e; by their fluidity they dilute vi&s;cid food; though here, indeed, they an&s;wer no better than common water. In two ways they promote the evacuation by &s;tool, and progre&s;s through the inte&s;tines; fir&s;t, by their fluidity and bulk; &s;econdly, by their ace&s;cency, which, uniting with the bile, forms the peculiar &s;timulus formerly mentioned. Carried into the blood ve&s;&s;els, in &s;o far as they retain any of the &s;aline nature, they &s;timulate the excretories and promote urine and &s;weat, correcting thus alkale&s;cency not only by mixture, but di&s;&s;ipation of the degenerated fluids.</P>
<P>Many Phy&s;icians, in treating of fermented liquors, have only mentioned the&s;e qualities, rejecting their nutritious virtue, which certainly ought to be taken in; though by expeding the evacuation by &s;tool they make le&s;s of the nutritious parts of the aliment to be taken up, and by &s;timulating the excretories make the&s;e nutritious parts to be for &s;horter time in the &s;y&s;tem. All the&s;e, and many more effects, ari&s;e from fermented liquors. Their ace&s;cency &s;ometimes promotes the di&s;ea&s;e of ace&s;cency, by increa&s;ing that of vegetables, acting as a ferment, and &s;o producing flatulency, purging, cholera, &amp;c. &s;o that, with vegetable aliment, as little drink

is nece&s;&s;ary, the mo&s;t innocent is pure water; and it is only with animal food that fermented liquors are nece&s;&s;ary. In warmer climates <HI>fermentata</HI> would &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to obviate alkale&s;cency and heat. But it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that though fermented liquors contain an acid, yet they al&s;o contain alcohol, which, though it adds &s;timulus to the &s;tomach, yet is extremely hurtful in the warmer climates, and wherever alkale&s;cency prevails in the &s;y&s;tem. Na|ture, in the&s;e climates, has given men an appetite for water im|pregnated with acid fruits, <HI>e. g.</HI> &s;herbet, but the u&s;e of this needs caution, as in the&s;e countries they are apt to &s;hun animal food, u&s;ing too much of the vegetable, and often thus cau&s;ing dangerous refri|gerations, choleras, diarrhoeas, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Of varieties of fermented liquors, I &s;hall only mention here the chief heads on which the&s;e varieties depend; fir&s;t, they are owing to the quality of the &s;ubject, as more or le&s;s vi&s;cid, upon its capa|city al&s;o of undergoing an active fermentation, although, perhaps, the more vi&s;cid be more nutritious. Hence the difference between ales and wines, by the fir&s;t meaning fermented liquors from <HI>fari|nacea,</HI> by the &s;econd from the fruits of plants. It depends, &s;econdly, on the acerbity, acidity, nature, and maturation of the fruit. Thirdly, the variety depends on the conduct of the fermentation. In gene|ral, fermentation is progre&s;&s;ive, being at fir&s;t active and rapid, de|taching the fixed air, or <HI>gas &s;ylve&s;tre,</HI> at the &s;ame time acquiring more acid than before. The&s;e qualities of flatulency and acidity remain for &s;ome time, but as the fermentation goes on, the liquor becomes more perfect, no air is detached, and alcohol is produced, &s;o that fermented liquors differ according to the progre&s;s of the fer|mentation, and have different effects on the &s;y&s;tem. When fer|mentation is &s;topped before it comes to maturity, though naturally it proceeds in this way, yet by addition of new ferment it may again be renewed with a turbid inte&s;tine motion.</P>

<P>The&s;e are certain acrid &s;ub&s;tances that we take in to give more ta&s;te to our aliment; for though I &s;aid our aliment &s;hould be bland, yet the &s;y&s;tem requires it &s;hould be &s;apid. This we obtain from the aromata, which &s;trictly are &s;uch as are pungent with &s;ome degree of fragrancy, as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, pimento, &amp;c. which are the produce of the warmer climates. Analogous to the&s;e, in Europe are the umbelliferous &s;eeds, ani&s;e, carraway, coriander, and the &s;weet herbs.

From the&s;e qualities they are fitly conjoined with our vegetable food, &s;timulating the &s;tomach, promoting the mixture and afflux, in proper quantity, of the animal fluids, and obviating the effects of flatulency. They ought properly only to be u&s;ed in tho&s;e countries where they are produced, becau&s;e from the heat people <HI>there</HI> live chiefly on vege|table diet.

<P>This is the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;ub&s;tance as a &s;apid, is mo&s;t univer&s;ally u&s;ed, and lea&s;t apt to pall, but beyond that quality I am at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay, as its effects are not yet well explained by Phy&s;icians. It is &s;aid to be anti&s;eptic; but this &s;eems contradicted by ob&s;erving, that it is often u&s;ed with vegetables, and that carnivorous animals are poi&s;oned by it, where its anti&s;eptic quality would be mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary; while the graminivorous &s;eem fond of it, and the hu&s;bandman often gives it to his cattle; and &s;ure here it cannot act by its anti&s;eptic quality. Dr. Pringle &s;ays, that a &s;mall quantity of &s;alt is &s;eptic, and a large one anti&s;eptic: But here I think the ex|periment was not accurate, as the &s;alt he employed was the common table &s;alt, which is far from being a pure common &s;alt. How this impure &s;alt acted in promoting putrefaction may be ea&s;ily conceived, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by the &s;uperabundant alkali, or earth of the &s;alt ab&s;orbing the acid, which would, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, have prevented putrefaction.

The nature of this body, as we take it with our a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ment, is little under&s;tood. As it has been found to be &s;eptic, we, apt to run into extremes, have concluded it produces &s;curvy from that power. Although &s;curvy is apt to be produced from &s;alted means, yet experiments evince that the &s;ame effects will re&s;ult from animal foods alone, long continued, and &s;alt alone has not yet been &s;een to produce that di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P>It is enquired whether it is hurtful as an acid, and avoided by tho&s;e who are affected with recent ace&s;cent vegetables?

Its anti&s;eptic virtue is proved by experiment, and therefore is properly u&s;ed with animal food. Its anti&s;eptic property, however, is not very powerful.</P>
<P>Other acids are u&s;ed as condiments with animal food, as juice of lemons, which, as acerb, is therefore le&s;s liable to active fermenta|tion&punc; but as their acerbity differs much in different lemons, the &s;ame quantity of vinegar is more &s;eldom found to have bad effects than of lemon juice, which, however, is more univer&s;ally preferred to the vinegar, which, be&s;ides its qualities formerly mentioned, is often ropy, foul, and di&s;agreeable.

<P>This is one of the principal ingredients in vegetable aliment, and affords a pure and copious nouri&s;hment; it is frequently em|ployed as a condiment al&s;o, but cannot be u&s;ed for the &s;ame length of time, and in &s;uch quantity, as common &s;alt, as its ta&s;te &s;oon palls on repetition. It may likewi&s;e be con&s;idered as an anti&s;eptic, and, as a vegetable &s;ub&s;tance, is capable of all the effects of ace&s;cent vegetables. With vegetables it increa&s;es their quantity of nutri|ment, but does not, I believe, correct their bad qualities, or hinder fermentation. It is le&s;s actively fermentable than the <HI>acido dulces</HI> or <HI>olera,</HI> more &s;o than the dried juice of fruits, as figs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it ought, therefore, to be u&s;ed &s;paringly with vegetables, and mo&s;t with ani|mal food: If not over expen&s;ive, it might be u&s;ed with the latter as an anti&s;eptic, being more vi&s;cid, and le&s;s liable to be decompo&s;ed by &s;olution, than common &s;alt.</P>

Putrid fevers, and epidemics, are al&s;o le&s;s frequent, as may appear from Sydenham's and Pringle's Ob&s;ervations, which I impute to the more frequent u&s;e of &s;ugar.

<HEAD>ANIMAL FOOD.</HEAD>
<P>We formerly di&s;tingui&s;hed animal from vegetable food, by &s;aying, that it required no a&s;&s;imilation, but only &s;olution and mixture. But this is not &s;o clear as has been commonly imagined. What gives ri&s;e to this doubt is, that carnivorous animals live on that without any vegetable mixture, or even &s;alt, by which they are even poi&s;oned, living long without putrid accumulations, which, though for a &s;hort time might produce little inconvenience, yet, in the cour&s;e of life, would certainly produce bad con&s;equences. This accumulation is obviated by particulars in their oeconomy, as &s;hort inte&s;tines; whereas in the phytovorous, long inte&s;tines are given to give ri&s;e to putre&s;cency. Again, the carnivorous animals are expo&s;ed to putri|dity, from their irregularity, taking in water in &s;mall quantity, &amp;c. They are &s;aid to be of quick excretions; but this is contradicted from their being capable to bear long ab&s;tinence, being glutted to|day with a full meal, and &s;tarved perhaps for &s;everal weeks after, which would be in other animals as the &s;ure&s;t means of pu&s;hing pu|trefaction to the greate&s;t degree. From all this we mu&s;t &s;u&s;pect &s;omething in carnivorous animals to prevent putrefaction.</P>
<P>Here let me offer a conjecture, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the food in the &s;tomach of carnivorous animals &s;uffers a decompo&s;ition in &s;ome degree, and becomes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. This appears probable, from the change which de|cocted or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lixated animal &s;ub&s;tances undergo, the&s;e broths becoming in time ace&s;cent: Be&s;ides, it has been &s;aid, that an acid is always found in the &s;tomach of the&s;e animals: If it be really &s;o, it can proceed from no other &s;ource but decompo&s;ition. However, in accounting for the effects of animal food on the human body, we may neglect this, and con&s;ider the di&s;ea&s;es thence ari&s;ing to proceed from
<PB N="96" REF="014000_0102_0F9286307A5716D0">
putridity; for no man, as has been proved from experiment, can bear animal food alone, without nau&s;ea, for even a few days. Putre&s;cency takes place in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, in the fir&s;t producing nau&s;ea and thir&s;t, which would oftener occur unle&s;s obviated by the acid of vegetables conjoined with it; in the &s;econd, violent purging, cholera, and dy&s;entery, from putrid exhalations.</P>
<P>Next, as to the &s;olution of animal food. This, though &s;eemingly of greater cohe&s;ion, is of more ea&s;y &s;olubility than vegetables. How|ever, I do not mean by this a quicker but a more entire &s;olubility; for very firm animal &s;ub&s;tances are extracted and di&s;&s;olved in the human body, and the firme&s;t, as bones, in &s;tomachs <HI>&s;imilar</HI> to the human, though, at the &s;ame time, I am convinced, that vegetables, which are not di&s;&s;olved at all, have yet their juices more <HI>quickly</HI> extracted than animal food, and pa&s;s <HI>&s;ooner</HI> off. For ea&s;ine&s;s of &s;olubility does not depend &s;o much on the firmne&s;s of texture, as on the vi&s;cidity of the juice. Thus the more young and &s;ucculent animal food is le&s;s &s;oluble than the old, veal than beef, lamb than mutton, &amp;c. And Dr. Robin&s;on relates, that a Gentleman who u&s;ed to take an evening puke, would throw up chicken unchanged, while of beef there were no remains. Animal food excites the fever mentioned as con&s;equent on dige&s;tion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> greater degree than ve|getable, giving a greater &s;timulus to the &s;tomach, and &s;o to the whole &s;y&s;tem; and the difference of animal foods depends on the putre&s;cency and vi&s;cidity taken together. Thus young food, being more vi&s;cid than old, though le&s;s putre&s;cent, is yet le&s;s &s;oluble. Ani|mal food differs al&s;o as to its per&s;pirability, or pa&s;&s;ing of the la&s;t con|coction. Sanctorius found mutton the mo&s;t per&s;pirable, and Keil and he call oy&s;ters lea&s;t &s;o, &s;o animal foods differ in their per&s;pira|bility, according as in their nature they approach nearer or recede farther from the&s;e.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>With regard to their difference in the &s;tomach.</HI> What we have &s;aid of decompo&s;ition, or ace&s;cency of animal food, never comes to a morbid degree, but the di&s;ea&s;e is always on the &s;ide of putre|&s;cency, which degree, however &s;eldom occurs, except when animal food has been repeated in too great proportion, or too frequently, either from nece&s;&s;ity, or too delicate luxury. The ace&s;cency, then, of vegetable aliment is more frequent, and ought more to be attended to than the alkale&s;cency of animal, which la&s;t, even in weak &s;tomachs, is &s;eldom felt; while ace&s;cency affects much both the &s;tomach and &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>With regard to their difference of &s;olution.</HI> Heavine&s;s, as it is called, is &s;eldom felt from vegetables, except from tough fari|naceous pa&s;te, or the mo&s;t vi&s;cid &s;ub&s;tances; while the heavine&s;s of animal food is more frequently noticed, e&s;pecially when in any great quantity. Difficulty of &s;olution does not depend &s;o much on firmne&s;s of texture, (as a man, from fi&s;h of all kinds, is more op|pre&s;&s;ed than from firmer &s;ub&s;tances) but on vi&s;cidity, and hence is more frequent in animal food, and e&s;pecially in the younger ani|mals; all which makes it evident, that both &s;low &s;olution, and the pa&s;&s;age of the food from the &s;tomach, is more owing to vi&s;cidity than firmne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>With regard to mixture.</HI> There is no in&s;tance of difficult mixture in vegetables, except in vegetable oils, while animal foods, from both vi&s;cidity and oiline&s;s, e&s;pecially the fatter meats, are re|fractory in this re&s;pect. I do not know whether the difference of animal and vegetable foods might not be referred to this head, of di|fficult mixture, for though the vegetable food may continue long in the &s;tomach, it gives little &s;timulus to the &s;y&s;tem. Now the &s;y&s;tem is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in proportion to the extent of this &s;timulus, which is in|comparably greater from the animal vi&s;cid oily food, than from the vegetable, &s;inner, and more aqueous. However, let me ob&s;erve
<PB N="98" REF="014000_0104_0F9286345957E270">
here, that there are certain applications to the &s;tomach, which have a tendency to bring on the cold fit of fever, independent of &s;timu|lus, merely by their refrigeration; and this often ari&s;es from vege|tables; as we &s;ee, in tho&s;e hot countries where intermittents prevail, they are oftner induced from a &s;urfeit of vegetable food than ani|mal. A proof of this is, that when one is recovering of an inter|mittent, there is nothing more apt to cau&s;e a relap&s;e than cold food, e&s;pecially if taken on tho&s;e days when the fit &s;hould return, and particularly ace&s;cent, fermentable vegetables, as &s;allad, melons, cucumbers, <HI>fructus, acido dulces,</HI> &amp;c. which are in my opinion, tho&s;e foods which are the mo&s;t frequent occa&s;ional cau&s;e of epide|mics; therefore, when an intermittent is to be avoided, we &s;hun vegetable diet, and give animal foods, although their &s;timulus be greater; and this, among others, is a proof that fever depends very much on the cold fit. Upon the whole, in attending to the&s;e four heads, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> A&s;&s;imilation, Solution, Mixture, and Stimu|lus, we &s;hall be able to judge of the choice of food with regard to the <HI>&s;tomach.</HI></P>
<P>Next, <HI>as to the inte&s;tines.</HI> When the putre&s;cency of animal food has gone too far, it produces, as I have &s;aid, an active &s;timulus, cau&s;ing <HI>diarrhoea, di&s;entery,</HI> &amp;c. But the&s;e effects are but rare; whereas from vegetable food and its acid, which, united with the bile, proves a pretty &s;trong &s;timulus, they more frequently occur, but luckily, however, are of le&s;s con&s;equence, if the refrigeration is not very great. In the autumnal &s;ea&s;on, when there is a tendency to dy&s;entery, if it is ob&s;erved that eating of fruits bring it on, it is rather to be a&s;cribed to their cooling than &s;timulating the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P><HI>As to the effects of animal and vegetable food on &s;tool.</HI> Wherever neither putrefaction, nor acidity, have gone a great length, I alledge that animal food keeps the belly more regular, and vegetable food gives a greater proportion of faeculent matter, and when ex&s;uccated by the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, is more apt to &s;tagnate, and produce &s;low belly and co&s;tivene&s;s than animal &s;timulating food, which, be|fore it comes to the great guts, where &s;toppage is made, has attained
<PB N="99" REF="014000_0105_0F928634ED499508">
a putrefactive tendency, and gives a proper &s;timulus, and thus tho&s;e who are co&s;tive, from vegetable food, when they have recour&s;e to animal, are in this re&s;pect better.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Effects of animal and vegetable foods in the blood ve&s;&s;els.</HI> They both give a blood of the &s;ame kind, but of different quality. Ani|mal food gives it in greater quantity, being wholly, as the expre&s;&s;ion is, convertible <HI>in &s;uccum et &s;anguinem,</HI> and of ea&s;y dige&s;tion; where|as the vegetable is more watery, and contains a portion of uncon|querable &s;aline matter, which cau&s;es it to be thrown cut of the body by &s;ome excretion. Animal food affords a more den&s;e &s;timu|lating ela&s;tic blood than vegetable, &s;tretching and cau&s;ing a greater re&s;i&s;tance to the &s;olids, and again exciting their &s;tronger action. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that ace&s;cency of vegetable food is carried into the blood ve&s;&s;els, and there exerts its effects; but the tendency of animal fluids is &s;o &s;trong to alkale&s;cency, that I cannot be per&s;uaded an acid acrimony every exi&s;ted in animal blood. Animal food alone will &s;oon produce an alkale&s;cent acrimony, and if a per&s;on who lives entirely on vegetables, were to take no food for a few days, his acri|mony would be alkale&s;cent.</P>
<P>We are next to take notice of the quantity of nutriment the&s;e different foods afford. Nutriment is of two kinds; the fir&s;t repairs the wa&s;te of the &s;olid fibres, the other &s;upplies certain fluids: The chief of the&s;e fluids is oil. Now, as animal food is ea&s;ier converted, and al&s;o longer retained in the &s;y&s;tem, and as it contains a greater proportion of oil, it will afford both kinds of nutriment more co|piou&s;ly than vegetables. A proof that corpulency is produced mo&s;t by animal food is, that in England there are more fat people than in any country of twice the bulk in the world.</P>
<P N="5">5. La&s;tly, <HI>As to the different degrees of per&s;pirability of the&s;e foods.</HI> This is not yet properly determined. Sanctorius con&s;tantly &s;peaks of mutton as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> per&s;pirable of all food, and of vegetables as checking per&s;piration. This is a con&s;equence of the different &s;ti|mulus
<PB N="100" REF="014000_0106_0F928635AF238528">
tho&s;e foods give to the &s;tomach, &s;o that per&s;ons who live on vegetables have not their per&s;piration &s;o &s;uddenly excited. In time of dige&s;tion, per&s;piration is &s;topped from whatever food, much more &s;o from cooling vegetables. Another rea&s;on why vegetables are le&s;s per&s;pirable, is, becau&s;e their aqueo-&s;aline juices determine them to go off by urine, while the more perfectly mixed animal food is more equally diffu&s;ed over the &s;y&s;tem, and &s;o goes off by per&s;piration. Hence Sanctorius's accounts may be under&s;tood; for vegetable <HI>aliment</HI> is not <HI>longer</HI> retained in the body, but mo&s;tly takes the cour&s;e of the kidneys. Both are equally per&s;pirable in this re&s;pect, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that a per&s;on living on either, returning once a day to his u&s;ual weight; and if we con&s;ider the little nouri&s;hment of vegetables, and the great tendency of animal food to corpulency, we mu&s;t allow that vegetable is more quickly per&s;pired than animal food.</P>
<P>Here I cannot avoid the que&s;tion &s;o often handled, <HI>Whether man was de&s;igned for animal or vegetable food?</HI> This que&s;tion has been managed unfairly; for in all other animals they take it up as a fact, by ob&s;erving what the animal chu&s;es; but they tell us man's rea&s;on leads him a&s;tray. For my part, I conceive little in this argument; for if in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e countries where no prejudice of cu&s;tom prevails, I &s;ee people live promi&s;cuou&s;ly on both, I conclude Nature has de&s;igned both for them; and, indeed, when we examine the &s;tructure of man's body, his, teeth, &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, we find Nature has de&s;igned him for a mixed aliment. He has <HI>dentes inci&s;ivi &amp; canini</HI> like the carnivorous, and a double row of grinders like the gramini|vorous. His &s;tomach approaches to that of the carnivorous animals, and his inte&s;tines in a middle between both, not &s;o long as the phy|tovorous, but not &s;o &s;hort as the carnivorous animals. But I would tru&s;t more to in&s;tinct producing practice, ab&s;tracted from artificial opinions; and in the&s;e ca&s;es we find the u&s;e of animals and vegeta|bles promi&s;cuou&s;ly. The Pythagoreans, and their modern imitators, the Brachmans, live on vegetables, merely from prejudice of opi|nion; and we need not heed tho&s;e mythologi&s;ts, who tells us that
<PB N="101" REF="014000_0107_0F92863671059B38">
man at fir&s;t lived on vegetables, as their accounts are not founded on fact. They are oppo&s;ed by this, that there are many nations &s;till in a rude &s;tate, and whom luxury has not yet perverted, who are &s;o far from living on vegetable food, that, from climate, they are obliged to live pretty entirely on animals; and the &s;tate of the Hunter and Shepherd is more &s;imple, and more ancient, than that of the Farmer or Gardener.</P>
<P>With regard to the effects of the&s;e foods on men, I would alledge, there are no per&s;ons who live entirely on vegetables; and the Py|thagoreans them&s;elves eat milk; and tho&s;e who do &s;o mo&s;tly, as the Pythagoreans above-mentioned, are weakly, &s;ickly, and meagre, labouring under a con&s;tant <HI>diarrhaea,</HI> and &s;everal other di&s;ea&s;es. None of the hardy robu&s;t laborious live on the&s;e, but chiefly &s;uch as gain a livelihood by the exertion of their mental faculties, as in the Ea&s;t Indies, factors and brokers; and this method of life is now confined to the hot climates, where vegetable diet, without inconve|nience; may be carried to great exce&s;s. Though it be granted, therefore, that man is intended to live on the&s;e different foods pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly, yet the vegetable &s;hould be in very great proportion. Thus the Laplanders are &s;aid to live entirely on animal food; but this is contradicted by the be&s;t accounts; for Linnaeus &s;ays, that be|&s;ides milk, which they take &s;our, to obviate the bad effects of animal food, they u&s;e al&s;o <HI>calla, menyanthes,</HI> and many other plants copi|ou&s;ly. So there is no in&s;tance of any nation living entirely either on vegetable or animal food, though there are indeed &s;ome who live particularly on one or other in the greate&s;t proportion. In the cold countries, <HI>e. g.</HI> the inhabitants live chiefly on animal food, on account of the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, their &s;maller per&s;piration, and little tendency to putrefaction.</P>
<P>Of more importance is the following than the former que&s;tion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>In what proportion animal and vegetable ought to be mixed?</HI> Fir&s;t, I &s;hall ob&s;erve that when I &s;peak of animal or vegetable foods here, I mean tho&s;e foods given in great proportion. To go on,
<PB N="102" REF="014000_0108_0F9286372E7E5FD0">
then; animal food gives mo&s;t &s;trength to the &s;y&s;tem. It is a known aphori&s;m of Sanctorius, that <HI>pondis addit robur,</HI> which may be ex|plained from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he impletion of the blood ve&s;&s;els, and giving a proper degree of ten&s;ion for the performance of &s;trong o&s;cillations. Now animal food not only goes a greater way in &s;upplying fluid, but al&s;o gives the fluid more den&s;e and ela&s;tic. The art of giving the utmo&s;t &s;trength to the &s;y&s;tem is be&s;t under&s;tood by tho&s;e who breed fight|ing cocks. The&s;e people rai&s;e the cocks to a certain weight, which mu&s;t bear a certain proportion to the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, and which, at the &s;ame time, is &s;o nicely proportioned, as that on lo&s;ing a few ounces of it, their &s;trength is very con&s;iderably impaired. Dr. Robin&s;on, of Dublin, has ob&s;erved, that the force and weight of the &s;y&s;tem ought to be determined by the largene&s;s of the heart, and its proportion to the &s;y&s;tem; for a large heart will give large blood ve&s;&s;els, while, at the &s;ame time, the vi&s;cera are le&s;s, particularly the liver, which la&s;t being increa&s;ed in &s;ize, a greater quantity of fluid is deter|mined into the cellular texture, and le&s;s into the &s;anguineous &s;y&s;tem. Hence we &s;ee how animal food gives &s;trength, by filling the &s;an|guiferous ve&s;&s;els. What pains we now be&s;tow on cocks, the an|cients did on the <HI>Athletae,</HI> by proper nouri&s;hment bringing them to a great degree of &s;trength and agility. It is &s;aid that tho&s;e men were at fir&s;t fed on figs, a proof of which we have &s;aid formerly of their nutritious quality; however, in this re&s;pect they were &s;oon found to fall far &s;hort of animal food; and thus we &s;ee, that men, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, will work in proportion to the quality of their food. The Engli&s;h labour more than the Scots, and wherever men are expo&s;ed to hard labour, their food &s;hould be animal, Animal food, al|though it gives &s;trength, yet loads the body; and Hippocrates long ago ob&s;erved, that the athletic habit, by a &s;mall encrea&s;e, was ex|po&s;ed to the greate&s;t hazards. Hence it is only proper for bodily labours, and entirely improper for mental exerci&s;es; for whoever would keep his mind acute and penetrating, will exceed rather on the &s;ide of vegetable food. Even the body is oppre&s;&s;ed with animal food; a full meal always produces dulne&s;s, lazine&s;s, and yawning; and hence the feeding of game&s;ters, who&s;e mind mu&s;t be ready to
<PB N="103" REF="014000_0109_0F928637EDFF8728">
take advantages, is always performed by avoiding a large quantity of animal food. Farther, with regard to the &s;trength of the body, animal food in the fir&s;t &s;tage of life is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;trength; in manhood, when we are expo&s;ed to active &s;cenes, it is more allow|able; and even in the decline of life, &s;ome proportion of it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the body in vigour. There are &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, which come on at the decay of life, at lea&s;t aggravated by it; among the&s;e I mean the Gout. This, when it is in the &s;y&s;tem, and does not appear with inflammation in the extremities, has pernicious effects there, attacking the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;tomach, head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now to deter|mine this to the extremities, a large proportion of animal food is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially as the per&s;on is commonly incapable of much exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Animal food, although it gives &s;trength, is yet of many hazards to the &s;y&s;tem, as it produces plethora and all its con&s;equences. As a &s;timulus to the &s;tomach and to the whole &s;y&s;tem, it excites fever, urges the circulation, and promotes per&s;piration. The &s;y&s;tem, however, by the repetition of the&s;e <HI>&s;timuli,</HI> is &s;oon worn out; and a man who has early u&s;ed the athletic diet, is either early carried off by inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, or, if he takes exerci&s;e &s;ufficient to render that diet &s;alutary, &s;uch an accumulation is made of putre&s;cent fluids, as in his after life lays a foundation of the mo&s;t inveterate chronic di&s;tempers. Therefore it is to be que&s;tioned, whether we &s;hould de&s;ire this high degree of bodily &s;trength, with all the inconveniencies and dangers. Plain it is, that tho&s;e who are chiefly employed in mental re&s;earches, and not expo&s;ed to too much bodily labour, &s;hould avoid an exce&s;s of animal food. There is a di&s;ea&s;e which &s;eems to require animal food, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the hy&s;teric or hypochondriac, which to me &s;eems to be very much a-kin to the Gout, affecting the alimentary canal. All people affected with this di&s;ea&s;e are much di&s;po&s;ed to ace&s;cency, and I have &s;een it go &s;o far, that no other vegetable but bread could be taken in, without occa&s;ioning the wor&s;t con&s;equences. Here then we are obliged to pre&s;cribe an animal diet, even to tho&s;e of very weak organs, for it generally obviates the &s;ymptoms. However, I have known &s;everal
<PB N="104" REF="014000_0110_0F92863974A67078">
in&s;tances of &s;curvy in exce&s;s produced by a long continued u&s;e of this diet, which it is always unlucky to be obliged to pre&s;cribe; and when it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;cribe, it &s;hould be joined with as much of the vegetable as po&s;&s;ible, and when a cure is performed, we &s;hould gradually recur to that again. If this luxurious age could be per&s;uaded, this di&s;ea&s;e might be removed with much le&s;s danger, by exerci&s;e, fre&s;h air, and avoiding warm chambers, venery, and late hours.</P>
<P>Next, let us con&s;ider the vegetable diet. The chief inconve|niency of this is difficulty of a&s;&s;imilation, which, however, in the vigorous and exerci&s;ed, will not be liable to occur. In warm climates the a&s;&s;imilation of vegetable aliment is more ea&s;y, &s;o that <HI>there</HI> it may be more u&s;ed, and when joined to exerci&s;e gives a pretty tolerable degree of &s;trength and vigour; and though the general rule be in favour of <HI>animal</HI> diet, for giving &s;trength, yet there are many in&s;tances of their being remarkably produced from vegetable. Vegetable diet has this advantage, that it whets the appetite, and that we can hardly &s;uffer from a full meal of it. Be&s;ides the di&s;orders it is liable to produce in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and its falling &s;hort to give &s;trength, I do not know any bad con&s;equences it can produce in the blood ve&s;&s;els, for where there is no in&s;tance where its peculiar acrimony was ever carried there, and it is cer|tainly le&s;s putrifiable than animal food; nor without the utmo&s;t indolence, and a &s;harp appetite, does it give generally plethora, or any of its con&s;equences; &s;o that we cannot here but conclude, that a large proportion of vegetable food is u&s;eful for the generality of mankind.</P>
<P>There is no error in this country more dangerous, or more com|mon, than the neglect of bread; for it is the &s;afe&s;t of vegetable ali|ment, and the be&s;t corrector of animal food; and, by a large propor|tion of this alone, have I obviated its bad con&s;equences, when u&s;ed in a hypochondriac &s;tate. The French apparently have as much animal food on their tables as the Britons, and yet, by a greater u&s;e
<PB N="105" REF="014000_0111_0F92863B66263470">
of bread, and the dried acid fruits, its bad effects are prevented; and therefore bread &s;hould be particularly u&s;ed by the Engli&s;h, as they are &s;o voracious of animal food. Vegetable food is not only nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ecure health, but long life; and, as we have &s;aid, in infancy and youth we &s;hould be confined to it mo&s;tly; in manhood, and decay of life, u&s;e animal; and, near the end, vegetable again.</P>
<P>There is another que&s;tion much agitated, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>What are the ef|fects of variety in food?</HI> Is it nece&s;&s;ary and allowable, or univer|&s;ally hurtful? Variety of a certain kind &s;eems to me nece&s;&s;ary, as vegetable and animal foods have their mutual advantages, tending to correct each other. Another variety, which is very proper, is that of liquid and &s;olid food, which &s;hould be &s;o managed as to temper each other; and I formerly ob&s;erved, that liquid food, e&s;pe|cially of the vegetable kind, is too ready to pa&s;s off before it is properly a&s;&s;imilated, while &s;olid food makes a long &s;tay. But this does not properly belong to the que&s;tion, whether variety of the &s;ame kind is nece&s;&s;ary or proper, as in animal foods, beef, fi&s;h, fowl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I indeed have never perceived any inconvenience ari&s;ing from this mixture, or difficulty of a&s;&s;imilation, provided a moderate quantity be taken; when any inconvenience does ari&s;e, it probably proceeds from this, that one of the particular &s;ub&s;tances in the mixture, when taken by it&s;elf would produce the <HI>&s;ame effect;</HI> and, indeed, it appears to me, that this effect is not <HI>heightened</HI> by the mixture, but probably <HI>obviated</HI> by it. There are few excep|tions to this, if any, <HI>e. g.</HI> taking a large proportion of ace&s;cent &s;ub&s;tances with milk. The coldne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> acidity, flatulency, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may appear, and it is po&s;&s;ible that the coagulum, from the ace&s;cency of the vegetables, being &s;omewhat &s;tronger induced, may give oc|ca&s;ion to too long retention in the &s;tomach, and to acidity in too great degree. Again, the mixture of fi&s;h and milk often occa&s;ions inconveniencies. The theory of this is difficult, though, from uni|ver&s;al con&s;ent, it mu&s;t certainly be ju&s;t. Can we &s;uppo&s;e that fi&s;h gives occa&s;ion to &s;uch a coagulum as rennet? If it does &s;o, it may produce the fore-mentioned bad effects. Be&s;ides, fi&s;h approach
<PB N="106" REF="014000_0112_0F92863C42F10188">
&s;omewhat to vegetables, in giving little &s;timulus, and are accu&s;ed of the &s;ame bad effects as the&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> bringing on the cold fit of fever.</P>
<P>Thus much may be &s;aid for variety: But it al&s;o has its di&s;advan|tages, provoking to gluttony; this, and the art of cookery, making men take in more than they properly can dige&s;t; and hence, per|haps very ju&s;tly, Phy&s;icians have univer&s;ally almo&s;t preferred &s;im|plicity of diet; for, in &s;pite of rules, man's eating will only be mea&s;ured by his appetite, and &s;atiety is &s;ooner produced by <HI>one</HI> than by <HI>many</HI> &s;ub&s;tances. But this is &s;o far from being an argument again&s;t variety, that it is one for it, as the only way of avoiding a full meal of animal food, and its bad effects, is by pre&s;enting a quan|tity of vegetables. Another mean of preventing the bad effects of animal food, is to take a large proportion of liquid; and it is on that account the bad effects of animal food are not &s;o much felt here, on account of our drinking much with it, and u&s;ing broths, which are at once excellent correctors of animal food, and preventors of gluttony.</P>
<P>Having now fini&s;hed what we had to &s;ay on animal food in ge|neral, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed &s;everal compari&s;ons and que&s;tions which aro&s;e on that &s;ubject, I now come to the particular &s;ub&s;tances mentioned in the Catalogue.</P>

<HEAD>MILK.</HEAD>
<P>Of the foods taken from animals, I chu&s;e to begin with milk, as it is a connecting and intermediate &s;ub&s;tance between animals and vegetables.

uncertain, though at the &s;ame time no ob&s;ervation proves the con|trary, whether it is not &s;o likewi&s;e in carnivorous animals. If it really be found of this nature it will &s;olve the que&s;tion about the de|compo&s;ition and ace&s;cency of the food of the&s;e la&s;t mentioned animals in the <HI>primae viae.</HI> But whatever be in this, it is certain, that the milk of all animals, who live on vegetables, is ace&s;cent. Milk being derived from the chyle, we thence conclude its vegetable nature, for in tho&s;e who live on both promi&s;cuou&s;ly, more milk is got, and more quickly, from the vegetable than the animal food. Milk, how|ever, is not purely vegetable, though we have a vegetable liquor that re&s;embles its ta&s;te, con&s;i&s;tence, colour, ace&s;cency, and the &s;epara|bility of the oily part, I mean an emul&s;ion of the <HI>nuces oleo&s;ae</HI> and farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances. But the&s;e want the coagulable part of milk, which &s;eems to be of animal nature, approaching to that of the coagulable lymph of the blood. Milk, then, &s;eems to be of an inter|mediate nature, between chyle taken up from the inte&s;tines, and their albumen, or fully elaborated animal fluid.</P>
<P>Its contents are of three kinds; fir&s;t, an oily part, which, what|ever may be &s;aid concerning the origin of other oils in the body, is certainly immediately derived from the oil of the vegetables taken in, as with the&s;e it agrees very exactly in its nature, and would entirely, if we could &s;eparate it fully from the coagulable part. Another mark of their agreement is the &s;eparability, which proves that the mixture has been lately attempted, but not fully performed. 2dly, Be&s;ides this oily, I have told you there is a proper coagulable part; and, 3dly, much water accompanies both, in which there is di&s;&s;olved a &s;aline &s;accharine &s;ub&s;tance. The&s;e three can be got &s;eparate in chee&s;e, butter, and whey, but never perfectly &s;o, a part of each being always blended with every other part.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common, from what has been &s;aid of its intermediate nature, than to &s;uppo&s;e that it requires no a&s;&s;imilation, and hence has been deduced the rea&s;on of its exhibition in the

mo&s;t weakly &s;tate of the human body. But wherever we can examine milk we always find that it coagulates, &s;uffers a decompo&s;ition, and becomes ace&s;cent. Again, infants, who feed entirely on milk, are always troubled with eructations, which every body ob&s;erves are not of the &s;ame quality with the food taken, and therefore I would alledge, that, like all other food, milk turns naturally ace&s;cent in the &s;tomach, and only appears in the chyle and blood, in con&s;equence of a new recompo&s;ition. It approaches then to the nature of vege|table aliment, but is not capable of its noxious vinous fermentation, and therefore has an advantage over it; neither from this quality, like animal food, is it heating in the &s;tomach, and productive of fever, though at the &s;ame time, from its quantity of coagulable matter, it is more nouri&s;hing than vegetables.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the general qualities of milk; now let us con&s;ider the&s;e as applicable to food. Milk is the food mo&s;t univer&s;ally &s;uited to all ages and &s;tates of the body, but it &s;eems chiefly de&s;igned by Nature as the food of infants. When animals are in the foetus &s;tate, their &s;olids are a perfect jelly, incapable of an a&s;&s;imilatory power. In &s;uch &s;tate Nature has perfectly a&s;&s;imilated food, as the <HI>albumen ovi</HI> in the oviparous, and in the viviparous animals certainly &s;omewhat of the &s;ame kind, as it was nece&s;&s;ary the ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be filled with &s;uch a fluid as would make way for an after a&s;&s;imilation. When the infant has attained a con&s;iderable degree of firmne&s;s, as when it is &s;eparated from the mother, yet &s;uch a degree of weakne&s;s &s;till re|mains, as makes &s;omewhat of the &s;ame indication nece&s;&s;ary. It behoves the infant to have an alkale&s;cent food ready prepared, and at the &s;ame time its noxious tendency to be avoided. Milk then is given, which is alkale&s;cent, and, at the &s;ame time, has a &s;ufficient quantity of acidity to correct that alkale&s;cency. As the body advances in growth, and the alkale&s;cent tendency is greater, the animal, to obviate that tendency, is led to take vegetable food, as more &s;uited to its &s;trength of a&s;&s;imilation.</P>

I ob&s;erved, that milk was almo&s;t &s;uited to all temperaments, and it is even &s;o to &s;tomachs di&s;po&s;ed to ace&s;cency, more than tho&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances which have undergone the vinous fermentation; nay, it even checks vinous fermentation, curing the heart-burn, and preci|pitating the lees, when, by renewal of fermentation, the wine hap|pens to be fouled. It therefore very properly accompanies a great deal of vegetable aliment, although &s;ometimes its ace&s;cency is trouble&s;ome, either from a large proportion taken in, or from the degree of it; for according to certain unaccountable circum&s;tances, different acids are formed in the &s;tomach, in a healthy body a mild one; in the hypochondriac di&s;ea&s;e, <HI>e. g.</HI> one &s;ometimes as corro&s;ive as the fo&s;&s;il acids. When the acidity of milk is carried to a great degree, it may prove remarkably refrigerant, and occa&s;ion cold cru|dities, and the recurrence of intermittent fevers. To take the com|mon notion of its pa&s;&s;ing, unchanged, into the blood, it can &s;uffer no &s;olution. But if, with me, you admit its <HI>coagulum</HI> in the &s;to|mach, then it may be reckoned among &s;oluble or in&s;oluble foods, according as that <HI>coagulum</HI> is more or le&s;s tenacious. Formerly ren|net, which is employed to coagulate milk, was thought an acid, but, from late ob&s;ervations, it appears that, if it be an acid, it is very different from other acids, and that its <HI>coagulum</HI> is &s;tronger than that produced by acids. It has been imagined that a rennet is to be found in the &s;tomachs of all animals, which cau&s;es coagulation of milk; but to me the coagulation of milk &s;eems to be owing to a weak acid in the &s;tomach, the relicts of our vegetable food induc|ing, in healthy per&s;ons, a weak and &s;oluble <HI>coagulum;</HI> but in dif|ferent &s;tomachs this may be very different, in the&s;e becoming heavy and le&s;s &s;oluble food, and &s;ometimes even evacuated in a coagulated undi&s;&s;olved &s;tate, both by &s;tomach and &s;tool.</P>
<P>As milk is ace&s;cent, it may be rendered &s;ometimes purgative by mixing with the bile; and I know &s;ome examples of this. More commonly, however, it is reckoned among tho&s;e foods which occa|&s;ion co&s;tivene&s;s.</P>

Hoffman, in his Experiments on Milk, found, that all kinds of it contained much water, and when this was di&s;&s;ipated, found the re&s;iduum very different in their &s;olubility. But we mu&s;t not thence conclude that the &s;ame in&s;olubility takes place in the &s;tomach, for extracts made from vegetables with water are often very in&s;oluble &s;ub&s;tances, and hardly diffu&s;ible through water it&s;elf; therefore in Hoffman's extracts, if I may &s;o call them, of milk, &s;omewhat of the &s;ame kind might have appeared, and the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, which in their natural &s;tate were not &s;o, might appear very in&s;oluble. However, we may allow that milk is always &s;omehow in&s;oluble in the inte&s;tines, as it is of a drying nature, and, as chee&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is very co&s;tive. And this effect, I think, &s;hows that milk is always coagulated in the &s;tomach; for if it remained fluid no faeces would be produced, whereas &s;ometimes very hard ones are ob&s;erved. In the blood ve&s;&s;els, from its animal nature, it may be con&s;idered as nutritious; but when we con&s;ider its vegetable contents, and ace&s;|cency in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> we find that, it does not like animal food, excite that degree of fever in the time of dige&s;tion, and that from its ace&s;cency it will re&s;i&s;t putrefaction. Hence is the foundation of its u&s;e in hectic fevers, which, whatever be their cau&s;e, appear only to be exacerbations of natural feveri&s;h paroxy&s;ms, which occur twice every day, commonly after meals, and at night. To obviate the&s;e, therefore, we give &s;uch an aliment as produces the lea&s;t exacerbation of the&s;e fevers; &s;uch is milk, on account of its ace&s;cent vegetable nature.</P>
<P>There appears al&s;o &s;omewhat peculiar in milk, which requires only a &s;mall exertion of the animal powers in order to its a&s;&s;imila|tion; and be&s;ides, in hectic complaints there is wanted an oily, bland food, approaching to the animal nature, &s;o that on all the&s;e accounts, milk is a diet peculiarly adapted to them, and, in general, to mo&s;t convale&s;cents, and to tho&s;e of inflammatory temperaments. There is a certain di&s;ea&s;e who&s;e proper &s;alutary form is that of inflammation, I mean the Gout. There is no method of curing, I had rather &s;ay preventing this, but by avoiding this inflammatory

tendency by a proper regulation of diet. The inflammatory form, which I &s;aid was the &s;alutary one, is al&s;o attended with a weakne&s;s of the nerves, &s;o that in our prevention we &s;hould not weaken the &s;y&s;tem too much, as would be done by vegetables, and therefore milk may be employed with advantage. However, it may be a que&s;tion how far, and in what ca&s;es, we ought even to obviate the gout, which is often a con&s;titutional di&s;ea&s;e, and has taken deep root in the &s;y&s;tem, and if prevented in its native inflammatory form, as it may often be by weakening too much, and &s;o will appear in other more pernicious ones. But there can be no objection again&s;t at|tempting this by milk. However, that attempt ought not be made but very early in life, and then, if this diet be u&s;ed with proper exerci&s;e, temperance, and avoiding of venery, there may be ex|pectations of &s;ucce&s;s; for in the decline of life, after one has been u&s;ed to high living, this low diet is often attended with pernicious con&s;equences. So far of milk in general. We &s;hall now &s;peak of the particular kinds mentioned in the Catalogue, and which are in common u&s;e. I have &s;et them down in the proportion of their &s;olid contents.</P>
<P>The three fir&s;t agree very much in their qualities, being very dilute, having little &s;olid contents, and, when envaporated to dryne&s;s, having the&s;e very &s;oluble, containing much &s;accharine matter, of a very ready ace&s;cency, and when coagulated, their <HI>coagulum</HI> being tender and ea&s;ily broke down. From this view you &s;ee they have le&s;s oil, and le&s;s coagulable matter than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The three la&s;t agree, in oppo&s;ite qualities, to the three men|tioned; but here there is &s;omewhat more of gradation. Cows milk comes neare&s;t to the former milks: Goats milk is le&s;s fluid, le&s;s &s;weet, le&s;s flatulent, has the large&s;t proportion of in&s;oluble part after coagulation, and indeed the large&s;t proportion of coagulable part; its oily and coagulable part are not &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;eparable, never throwing out a cream, or allowing butter to be readily ex|tracted from it. Hence the virtues of the&s;e milks are obvious,
<PB N="112" REF="014000_0118_0F928642A9E52C88">
being more nouri&s;hing, though, at the &s;ame time, le&s;s ea&s;ily &s;oluble in weak &s;tomachs, than the three fir&s;t, le&s;s ace&s;cent than the&s;e, and &s;o more rarely laxative, and peculiarly fitted for the diet of convale&s;cents without fever. The three fir&s;t, again, are le&s;s nou|ri&s;hing, more &s;oluble, more laxative as more ace&s;cent, and adapted to the convale&s;cents with fever.</P>
<P>The&s;e qualities, in particular milks, are con&s;iderably diver&s;ified by different circum&s;tances. Fir&s;t, Different animals, living on the &s;ame diet, give a con&s;iderably different milk; for there &s;eems to be &s;omething in the con&s;titution, ab&s;tracting from the aliment, which con&s;titutes a con&s;iderable diver&s;ity of milk, not only in the &s;ame &s;pecies of animals, but al&s;o in the &s;ame animal, at different ages, and at different di&s;tances after delivery: This, you will ea&s;ily per|ceive, applies to the choice of nur&s;es. Secondly, Milk follows the nature of the aliment more than any other juice in the human body, being more or le&s;s fluid and dilute, more or le&s;s &s;olid and nouri&s;hing, in proportion as the&s;e qualities are more or le&s;s in the aliment. <HI>(a)</HI> The nature of the aliment differs according to its time of growth, <HI>e. g.</HI> old gra&s;s being always found more nouri&s;hing than young. <HI>(b)</HI> Aliment, too, is always varied according to the &s;ea&s;on, as that is warm or dry, moi&s;t or cloudy.</P>
<P>The milk of each particular kind of animal is fitter for particular purpo&s;es, when fed on proper food. Thus the cow delights in the &s;ucculent herbage of the vale: If the &s;heep be fed there he certainly rots, but on the higher and more dry &s;ide of the mountain he feeds plea&s;antly and healthy; while the goat never &s;tops near the bottom, but a&s;cends to the craggy &s;ummit: And certainly the milks of the&s;e animals are always be&s;t in their proper &s;oil, and that of goats is be&s;t on a mountainous country. From a di&s;&s;ertation of Linnaeus, we have many ob&s;ervations concerning the diver&s;ity of plants on which each animal chu&s;es to feed. All the Swedi&s;h plants, which could be collected together, were pre&s;ented alter|nately to dome&s;tic animals, and then it appeared that the goat
<PB N="113" REF="014000_0119_0F92864384CD08D0">
lived on the greate&s;t variety, and even on many which were poi|&s;onous to the re&s;t; that the cow cho&s;e the fir&s;t &s;ucculent &s;hoots of the plant, and neglected the fructification, which la&s;t was preferred by the goat. Hence may be deduced rules concerning the pa&s;turage of different animals; <HI>e. g.</HI> Farmers find that, in a pa&s;ture which was only fit to feed a certain number of &s;heep, an equal number of goats may be introduced, while the &s;heep are no le&s;s nouri&s;hed than before.</P>

<HEAD>RULES for the USE of MILK.</HEAD>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign the difference between milk fre&s;h drawn and that detained in the open air for &s;ome time, but certainly there is &s;ome material one, otherwi&s;e nature univer&s;ally would not have directed infants to &s;ucking; and indeed it &s;eems, better than the other, fitted for dige&s;tion and nouri&s;hment. Phy&s;icians have &s;up|po&s;ed that this depended on the evaporation of &s;ome &s;pt. rector. but indeed I cannot conceive any &s;uch, except common water here; and be&s;ides, the&s;e volatile parts can hardly be nutritious. A more plau&s;ible account &s;eems deducible from mixture: Milk expo&s;ed for &s;ome time to the air, &s;uffers more or le&s;s of &s;pontaneous &s;eparation, a circum&s;tance hurtful to dige&s;tion, none of the parts being, by them&s;elves, &s;o ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imilated as when they are all taken together. Hence, then, milk new drawn is more intimately blended, and there|fore then is mo&s;t proper to the weakly and infants.</P>
<P>Another difference in the u&s;e of milk expo&s;ed for &s;ome time to the air, is taking it boiled or unboiled. Phy&s;icians have generally recommended the former, but the rea&s;on is not ea&s;ily a&s;&s;igned. Perhaps the rea&s;on is this, Milk kept for &s;ome time expo&s;ed to the air has gone &s;o far to a &s;pontaneous &s;eparation; whereas the heat thoroughly blends the whole, and hence its re&s;olution is not &s;o ea&s;y in the &s;tomach; and thus boiled milk is more co&s;tive than raw, and gives more faeces. Again, when milk is boiled, a con&s;i|derable quantity of air is detached, as appears from the froth on the &s;urface, and air is the chief in&s;trument of fermentation in
<PB N="114" REF="014000_0120_0F928643ED87DE58">
bodies, &s;o that, after this proce&s;s, it is not liable to ace&s;cency; for the&s;e rea&s;ons it is proper for the robu&s;t and vigorous.</P>
<P>Another difference of milk is, according as it is fluid or coagu|lated. The coagulated is of two kinds, as induced by rennent, or the natural ace&s;cency of the milk. The former preparation makes the firmer and le&s;s ea&s;ily &s;oluble <HI>coagulum,</HI> though, when taken with the whey un&s;eparated, it is le&s;s difficult of &s;olution, though more &s;o than any other <HI>coagulum</HI> in the &s;ame ca&s;e. Many nations u&s;e the latter form, which is ea&s;ier &s;oluble, but very much ace&s;cent, and there|fore the former, in point of &s;olution, &s;hould be confined to the vigo|rous; the latter, in point of ace&s;cency, to tho&s;e who live on al|kale&s;cent food; and in the la&s;t ca&s;e the Laplanders u&s;e it as their chief ace&s;cent condiment. From the &s;ame con&s;iderations it is more cooling, and in its other effects like all other ace&s;cent vegetables.</P>
<P>We now come to the examination of the parts into which milk &s;eparates; and fir&s;t, with regard to the</P>

<HEAD>COAGULABLE PART.</HEAD>
<P>This we u&s;e at all different ages, from fre&s;h curd to old chee&s;e. The whole of this is chiefly animal; hence it is the mo&s;t nutritive part, and much the mo&s;t in&s;oluble, and hence gives mo&s;t faeces, and therefore the common notion of chee&s;e's co&s;tivene&s;s is ju&s;t. So far of chee&s;e in general. It differs in proportion to the quantity of oily parts natural in or added to the coagulable part. The more rich oily parts there are in chee&s;e, the more it is nutritive and &s;oluble, lean chee&s;e being among the mo&s;t in&s;oluble aliments. Chee&s;e is liable to rancidity and putrefaction, and then we mu&s;t con&s;ider it as having all the effects of animal food the farther ad|vanced to putrefaction; at this time it cea&s;es to be nutritive, and is only to be con&s;idered as a fit condiment for vegetable food. In general, chee&s;e, as an aliment, is only fit for the laborious and robu&s;t.</P>

<P>We u&s;e this, in con&s;equence of its immediate &s;pontaneous &s;epara|tion, in the &s;tate of cream. This is liable to acidity and rancidity, on both which accounts it is of difficult mixture and dige&s;tion in the &s;tomach, and I do not know but all the bad effects of milk may be imputed to cream, the quarter part of which is not pure oil, and the re&s;t coagulable and &s;aline parts. In the form of butter the oil is much more pure, and then may be u&s;ed with advantage in diet: I have mentioned it as a &s;trong nutriment, fit to accompany our vegetable diet, e&s;pecially to the leaner <HI>farinacea,</HI> in order to give them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the qualities of the rich <HI>nuces oleo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</HI> Butter is more ran|ce&s;cent than olive oil, but as that cannot be had here, either pure or fre&s;h, we u&s;e our own butter with greater propriety.</P>

<HEAD>WATERY SALINO-SACCHARINE PART.</HEAD>
<P>This will be different, according as the milk has been coagulated by rennet, or its own ace&s;cency. By rennet, the coagulable part is more purely &s;eparated, and a proportion of oil goes along with the whey; but when the milk is coagulated by its own &s;ouring, the watery part is almo&s;t purely acid, and &s;eldom u&s;ed. The whey contains much &s;accharine part, and &s;o is more ace&s;cent than entire milk, and has even been &s;aid to be capable of vinous fermentation: Certainly it approaches nearer to it than milk it|&s;elf, and hence is more capable of a noxious ace&s;cency, and hence is more purgative and flatulent than milk. Of all ingredients in milk, there is a great proportion which goes along with the whey, and therefore it will be a nutritious &s;ub&s;tance, though at fir&s;t &s;ight, as that was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;eparated, it might &s;eem otherwi&s;e. Diffe|rent milks yield wheys of different qualities; cows milk allows le&s;s of its oil to be &s;eparated with the whey; from that of &s;heep and goats, there is more. In &s;ome mea&s;ure the whey follows the nature of the milk; goats whey is more nutritious, and may be &s;ub&s;tituted for womens, a&s;&s;es, and mares, in hectic ca&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Goats whey is

a medicine of great u&s;e in many ca&s;es, and perhaps its advantages are improved by the nece&s;&s;ary reparation to mountainous countries to obtain it, not only becau&s;e it is there more perfect, but al&s;o be|cau&s;e of the change of the &s;moaky city air into light and &s;alubrious. By taking the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances in the form of whey, there is introduced into the habit a bland, ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imilated nouri&s;hment, pa&s;&s;ing off ea&s;ily by the &s;ecretions, and &s;oon changing the &s;tate of the fluids. If it were not for regard to the &s;tate of the &s;tomach, liquid food would often be employed with advantage, as, in many ca&s;es, encrea&s;e of fluidity gives encrea&s;e of nouri&s;hment; and thus a calf is more effectually nouri&s;hed by diluting its milk with equal quantity of water, than if the milk were given alone. Quite analogous to this is the taking in this bland and mild nouri&s;hment in form of whey, e&s;pecially from the richer milk.</P>

<P>Here the whey and coagulable part are more entirely &s;eparated from the oily, but the coagulable part in butter milk is broke down, re&s;olved, and of ea&s;y dige&s;tion.

<P>The fir&s;t difference of animal food regards its &s;olubility, de|pending on a lax or firm texture of its different kinds. Solubility of animal food &s;eems to de&s;erve le&s;s attention than is commonly imagined; for I have known per&s;ons of a weak &s;tomach incapable of breaking down the texture of vegetables, or even of di&s;&s;olving a light pudding, to whom hung beef, or a piece of ham, was very grateful, and ea&s;ily dige&s;ted. None of the theories given for the &s;olution of animal food in the human &s;tomach &s;eem to me &s;uffi|ciently to have explained that proce&s;s. Long ago has been di&s;carded the &s;uppo&s;ition of an active corro&s;ive men&s;truum there, and al&s;o the doctrine of trituration, for which, indeed, there &s;eems no mechani&s;m in the human body; and we now commonly agree with Boerhaave, &s;uppo&s;ing nothing more nece&s;&s;ary than a watery men&s;truum, moderate heat and frequent agitation. This will account for &s;olution in &s;ome ca&s;es, but not entirely. Let us try to imitate it out of the body with the &s;ame circum&s;tances, and in ten times the time in which the food is di&s;&s;olved in the &s;tomach, we &s;hall not be able to bring about the &s;ame changes. Take the coagulated white of an egg, which almo&s;t every body can ea&s;ily dige&s;t, and yet no artifice &s;hall be able to di&s;&s;olve it. Hence then we are led to &s;eek another cau&s;e for &s;olution, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> fermentation, a notion, indeed, formerly embraced, but on the introduction of mechanical philo&s;ophy, indu&s;|triou&s;ly bani&s;hed, with every other &s;uppo&s;ition of that proce&s;s taking place at all in the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>Many of the ancients imagined this fermentation to be putre|factive; but this we deny, as an acid is produced; though hence
<PB N="118" REF="014000_0124_0F92864995A55608">
the fermentation might be reckoned the vinous, which, however, I have formerly proved to you to be morbid. Neither, indeed, is the fermentation purely acetous, but modified by putre&s;cents; for Pringle has ob&s;erved, that animal matters rai&s;e and even expede the acetous proce&s;s. The fermentation, then, in the &s;tomach is of a mixed nature, between the acetous and putrefactive, mutually modifying each other; though, indeed, in the inte&s;tines, &s;omewhat of the putrefactive &s;eems to take place, as may be ob&s;erved from the &s;tate of the faeces broke down, and from the little di&s;po&s;ition of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances to be &s;o, which are not liable to the putrefactive proce&s;s, as the firmer parts of vegetables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon this view &s;olution &s;eems to be extremely ea&s;y, and tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances to be mo&s;t ea&s;ily broke down which are mo&s;t &s;ubject to putrefaction.</P>
<P>But &s;olution al&s;o depends on other circum&s;tances, and hence requires a more particular regard. Fir&s;t, there is a difference of &s;olubility with re&s;pect to the manducation of animal food, for which bread is extremely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to keep the more &s;lippery parts in the mouth till they be properly comminuted. From want of proper manducation I have known many per&s;ons &s;ubject to eructations, and this more frequently from the firm vegetable foods than from the animal, as apples, almonds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> though, indeed, even from animal food, very tendinous, or &s;wallowed in unbroken ma&s;&s;es, &s;uch &s;ometimes occur. Manducation is &s;o much connected with &s;olution, that &s;ome, from imperfectly performing that, are obliged to belch up their food, remanducate it, and &s;wallow it again before the &s;tomach can di&s;&s;olve it, or proper nouri&s;hment be extracted. Another proof of our regard to &s;olubility, is our re|jecting the firmer parts of animal food, as bull beef, and generally carnivorous animals.</P>
<P>Its effects with regard to &s;olubility I al&s;o take, &s;econdly, to be the foundation of our choice between <HI>fat</HI> and <HI>lean, young</HI> and <HI>old meats.</HI> In the <HI>lean,</HI> although, perhaps, a &s;ingle fibre might be &s;ufficiently tender, yet the&s;e, when collected in <HI>fa&s;ciculi,</HI> are very firm
<PB N="119" REF="014000_0125_0F92864A7A270DF0">
and compact, and of difficult &s;olution; whereas in the <HI>fat</HI> there is a greater number of ve&s;&s;els, a greater quantity of juice, more inter|po&s;ition of cellular &s;ub&s;tance, and con&s;equently more &s;olubility. Again, in young animals, in my opinion, there is the &s;ame number of fibres as in the older, but the&s;e more connected; whereas, in the older, the growth depending on the &s;eparation of the&s;e, and the encrea&s;e of ve&s;&s;els and cellular &s;ub&s;tance, the texture is le&s;s firm and more &s;oluble, which qualities, with regard to the &s;tomach, are at that time too encrea&s;ed, by the encrea&s;ed alkale&s;cency of the animal. To this al&s;o may be referred our choice of ca&s;trated animals, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> on their di&s;po&s;ition to fatten after the operation.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is with a view to the &s;olubility, that we make a choice be|tween meats recently killed, and tho&s;e which have been kept for &s;ome time. As &s;oon as meat is killed the putrefactive proce&s;s be|gins, which commonly we allow to proceed for a little, as that proce&s;s is the mo&s;t effectual breaker down of animal matters, and a great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;olution. The length of time during which meat ought to be kept, is proportioned to the meat's tendency to undergo the putrid fermentation, and the degree of tho&s;e circum&s;tances which favour it: Thus in the Torrid Zone, where meat cannot be kept above four or five hours, it is u&s;ed much more recent than in the&s;e northern climates.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Boiled</HI> or <HI>roa&s;ted</HI> meats create a difference of &s;olution. By boiling we extract the juices interpo&s;ed between the fibres, approxi|mate them more to each other, and render them of more difficult &s;olubility, which is encrea&s;ed too by the extraction of the juices, which are much more alkale&s;cent than the fibres; but when we want to avoid the &s;timulus of alkale&s;cent food, and the quick &s;olu|tion, as in &s;ome ca&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e, boiled is not to be cho&s;en. Of roa&s;ted meat, it may be a&s;ked whether are more proper, tho&s;e which are mo&s;t or lea&s;t roa&s;ted. That which is lea&s;t done is cer|tainly the mo&s;t &s;oluble; even raw meats are more &s;oluble than dre&s;&s;ed, as I know from a per&s;on who from nece&s;&s;ity was obliged,
<PB N="120" REF="014000_0126_0F92864AAEDBE538">
for &s;ome time, to eat &s;uch: But at the &s;ame time that meats little done are very &s;oluble, they are very alkale&s;cent; &s;o that, wherever we want to avoid alkale&s;cency in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> the mo&s;t roa&s;ted meats &s;hould be cho&s;en. Tho&s;e who throw away the broths of boiled meat do very improperly; for, be&s;ides their &s;upplying a fluid, (as I formerly ob&s;erved,) from their greater alkale&s;cency they en|crea&s;e the &s;olubility of the meat. Here we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that pure blood has been thought in&s;oluble; undoubtedly it is very nutritious, and though out of the body, like the white of eggs, it &s;eems very in&s;oluble, yet, like that too, <HI>in</HI> the body it is commonly ea&s;ily di|ge&s;ted. Mo&s;es very properly forbad it the I&s;raelites, as, in warm countries, it is highly alkale&s;cent, and even here, when it was u&s;ed in great quantity, the &s;curvy was more frequent; but to a moderate u&s;e of it, in the&s;e climates, no &s;uch objection takes place.</P>
<P N="5">5. Solubility is varied from another &s;ource, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> vi&s;cidity of the juice of aliment. Young animals, then, appear le&s;s &s;oluble than old, not on account of their compaction and firmne&s;s of texture, but rather on their greater vi&s;cidity of juice. See Dr. Brian Robin&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Dublin, on this head. And nothing is more common, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;erved, than to be longer oppre&s;&s;ed from a full meal of veal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the &s;ame quantity of beef, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon account too of their greater vi&s;cidity of juice, are the tendinous and ligamentous parts of animals longer retained than the purely mu&s;cular, as well as on account of their firmne&s;s of texture. Even fi&s;hes, who&s;e mu&s;cular parts are exceedingly tender, are, on account of their gluey vi&s;co&s;ity, longer of &s;olution in the &s;tomach. And eggs, too, which are exceed|ingly nouri&s;hing, have the &s;ame effect, and cannot be taken in great quantity: For the &s;tomach is peculiarly &s;en&s;ible to gelatinous &s;ub|&s;tances, and by this means has Nature perhaps taught us, as it were by a &s;ort of in&s;tinct, to limit our&s;elves in the quantity of &s;uch nutri|tive &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P N="6">6. With regard to &s;olution, we mu&s;t take in the oils of animal food, which, when tolerably pure, are the lea&s;t putre&s;cent part of
<PB N="121" REF="014000_0127_0F92864B6E66FB88">
it, and by dimini&s;hing the cohe&s;ion of the fibres, render them more &s;oluble. On this la&s;t account is the lean of fat meat more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved than other lean. But when the meat is expo&s;ed to much heat, this oil is &s;eparated, leaving the &s;olid parts le&s;s ea&s;ily &s;oluble, and becoming it&s;elf empyreumatic, rance&s;cent, and of difficult mixture in the &s;tomach. Fried meats, from the rea&s;ons now given, and baked meats, for the &s;ame, as well as the tenacity of the pa&s;te, are preparations which dimini&s;h the &s;olubility of the food. From what has been &s;aid, the preparation of food by fattening it, and keeping it for &s;ome time after killed, although it may admini&s;ter to gluttony, will yet, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, encrea&s;e the &s;olution of the food.</P>
<P>The &s;econd difference of animal food is with regard to</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="characteristic of food">
<HEAD>ALKALESCENCY.</HEAD>
<P>Of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> we have taken a little notice already under the fir&s;t head of Solubi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the too great alkale&s;cency we commonly avoid the carnivorous animal, and the <HI>ferae,</HI> and chu&s;e rather the granivorous. Some birds, indeed, which live on in&s;ects, are admitted into our food; but no man, without <HI>nau&s;ea,</HI> can live long upon the&s;e alone, for any length of time. Fi&s;hes, too, are an exception to this rule, living almo&s;t univer&s;ally on each other. But in the&s;e the alkale&s;cency does not proceed &s;o far; whether from the vi&s;cidity of their juice, their want of heat, or &s;ome peculiarity in their oeconomy, I will not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>Secondly, Alkale&s;cency is determined by difference of age. The older animals are always more alkale&s;cent than the young, from their continual progre&s;s to putrefaction. Perhaps this may depend on the nouri&s;hment of the younger animals, milk, vegetables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Homberg always found, in his endeavours to extract an acid from
<PB N="122" REF="014000_0128_0F92864C2F3E5C40">
human blood, that more was obtained from the young than from the old animals.</P>
<P>A third circum&s;tance which varies the alkale&s;cency of the food, is the wildne&s;s or tamene&s;s of the animal; and this again &s;eems to depend on its exerci&s;e. I knew a Gentleman who was fond of cats for food, but he always u&s;ed to feed them on vegetable food, and keep them from exerci&s;e; and in the &s;ame manner did the Romans rear up their rats, when intended for food. In the &s;ame way the fle&s;h of the partridge and hen &s;eems to be much the &s;ame; only, from its being more on the wing, the one is more alkale&s;cent than the other. Again, tame animals are commonly u&s;ed with|out their blood, whereas the wild are commonly killed in their blood, and upon that account, as well as their greater exerci&s;e, are more alkale&s;cent.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The alkale&s;cency of food may be determined from the quantity of volatile &s;alt it affords. The older the meat is, it is found to give the greater proportion of volatile &s;alt.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The alkale&s;cency of aliment may al&s;o, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be determined from its colour, the younger animals being whiter and le&s;s alkale&s;cent. We al&s;o take a mark from the colour of the gravy poured out, according to the redne&s;s of the juices judging of the animal's alkale&s;cency.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The reli&s;h of food is found to depend much on its alka|le&s;cency, as al&s;o the &s;timulus it gives and the fever it produces in the &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e effects are al&s;o complicated with the vi&s;cidity of the food, by which means it is longer detained in the &s;tomach, and the want of alkale&s;cency &s;upplied.</P>
<P>Having mentioned Animal Food as differing in &s;olubility and alkale&s;cency, which often go together in the &s;ame &s;ubject, we come to the third difference, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="quantity of food">
<PB N="123" REF="014000_0129_0F92864D1C04E9A0">
<HEAD>QUANTITY of NUTRIMENT,</HEAD>
<P>Which is either ab&s;olute or relative; ab&s;olute with re&s;pect to the quantity it really contains, &s;ufficient powers being given to extract it; relative, with re&s;pect to the a&s;&s;imilatory powers of tho&s;e who u&s;e it. The ab&s;olute nutriment is of &s;ome con&s;equence, but the relative in the robu&s;t and healthy, and except in ca&s;es of extraordi|nary weakne&s;s, may, without much inconvenience, be di&s;regarded. In another ca&s;e is the quantity of nouri&s;hment relative, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> with regard to its <HI>per&s;pirability;</HI> for if the food is &s;oon carried off by the excretions, it is the &s;ame thing as if it contained a le&s;s proportion of nouri&s;hment. For, giving more fluid, that which is longer retained affords mo&s;t, and for the repair of the &s;olids, that retention al&s;o is of advantage. Now gelatinous &s;ub&s;tances are long retained, and are, be&s;ides, animal &s;ub&s;tances them&s;elves, di&s;&s;olved &s;o, that, both ab&s;o|lutely and relatively, &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances are nutritious. Of this kind are eggs, &s;hell fi&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In adults, though it is di&s;puted whether their &s;olids need any repair, yet at any rate, at this period, fluid is more required; for this purpo&s;e the alkale&s;cent foods are mo&s;t proper, being mo&s;t ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved. They are, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t per&s;pirable; on one hand that alkale&s;cency leading to di&s;ea&s;e, while on the other their per&s;pirability obviates it. Adults, therefore, as Writers ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, are better nouri&s;hed on the alkale&s;cent; the young and growing, on gelatinous foods. All this leads to a com|pari&s;on of young and old meats, the fir&s;t being more gelatinous, and the la&s;t more alkale&s;cent. This, however, by experience, is not yet properly a&s;certained. Mr Geoffroy is the only per&s;on I know who has been taken up with the analy&s;is of foods. See Memoirs de l'Academie l'an 1731 &amp; 1732. His attempt was certainly laudable, and in &s;ome re&s;pects u&s;efully performed, but in general his expe|riments are not &s;ufficiently repeated, nor, indeed, &s;ufficiently accu|rate; and I would refu&s;e that beef and veal have been properly examined, for he has not been on his guard again&s;t the various circum&s;tances which affect meats; the cow kind liking a moi&s;t

&s;ucculent herbage, which is not to be got in warm climates; while the &s;heep are fond of a dry food, and thrive be&s;t there. Again, &s;ome of his experiments &s;eem contradictory. He &s;ays, that veal gives more &s;olution than beef, while lamb gives le&s;s than mutton; which, I confe&s;s is much to be doubted. If both he and Sanctorius had examined Engli&s;h beef, the re&s;ult, probably, would have been very different as to its per&s;pirability, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Be&s;ides, Mr. Geoffroy has only anali&s;ed beef and veal when raw, has made no proper circum|&s;tantial compari&s;ons between quadrupeds and birds, and has exa|mined the&s;e la&s;t along with their bones, and not their mu&s;cles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by them&s;elves, as he ought to have done, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If a &s;et of experi|ments of this kind were properly and accurately performed, they might be of great u&s;e; but at pre&s;ent, for the purpo&s;e of deter|mining our pre&s;ent &s;ubject, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to our alka|le&s;cency, &s;olubilty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="characteristic of food">
<HEAD>PERSPIRABILITY.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;um of what I have to &s;ay on this matter is this, that &s;uch foods as promote an accumulation of fluid in our ve&s;&s;els, and di&s;po&s;e to plethora, are the lea&s;t per&s;pirable, and commonly give mo&s;t &s;trength; that the more alkale&s;cent foods are the mo&s;t per&s;pirable, though the vi&s;cid and le&s;s alkale&s;cent may attain the &s;ame property by long retention in the &s;y&s;tem. The authors on Per&s;pirability have determined the Per&s;piration of Foods as imperfectly as Mr. Geoffroy has done the Solubility, and in a few ca&s;es only. We
<PB N="125" REF="014000_0131_0F928650EB0AF390">
mu&s;t not lay hold on what Sanctorius has &s;aid on the per&s;pirability of mutton, becau&s;e he has not examined, in the &s;ame way, other meats in their perfect &s;tate; far le&s;s on what Keil &s;ays of oy&s;ters, as he him&s;elf was a valetudinarian, and con&s;equently an unfit &s;ubject for &s;uch experiments, and probably of a peculiar temperament.</P>
<P>Having now fini&s;hed the examination of Animal Food in general, we come to the con&s;ideration of particular animals, of which much cannot be expected to be &s;aid, after we have &s;o fully delivered our general principles.</P>
<P>Animals are divided into &s;ix cla&s;&s;es, the <HI>Quadrupedia, Aves, Am|phibia, Pi&s;ces, In&s;ecta, Vermes.</HI> In my Catalogue I have entirely omitted the <HI>Amphibia,</HI> but &s;hall &s;upply them in their proper place, The advantages of this divi&s;ion will be known to any one who con|&s;ults the fir&s;t volume of Linnaeus's great <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae.</HI> That it &s;hould often contradict common language, is not to be wondered at, &s;ince that aro&s;e from a gro&s;s &s;uperficial view of things. Linnaeus, for the term <HI>Quadrupedia,</HI> now u&s;es that of <HI>Mammalia,</HI> on account of the former excluding the cetaceous fi&s;hes, which, although they have not four feet, have yet the other di&s;tingui&s;hing properties of the <HI>Quadrupedia,</HI> an heart with two auricles and two ventricles, lungs with which they breathe alternately, <HI>penis intrans,</HI> and, be|&s;ides, are viviparous and lactiferous, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This cla&s;s is &s;ubdivided into different orders, and it &s;eems doubt|ful whether any of them are rejected from our food, e&s;culent animals, (if I may &s;ay &s;o,) in different countries, being taken from every one of them. The <HI>Pecora</HI> are the order chiefly u&s;ed here, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by being hoofed, ruminant animals, phytovo|rous, dome&s;tic, tame, and generally horned. The&s;e, from living on vegetables, are perhaps the mo&s;t proper food, and al&s;o from their being tame and dome&s;tic. Of the <HI>Pecora,</HI> tho&s;e more com|monly in u&s;e are the cow, &s;heep, goat, and deer or hart. In other

<P>This we u&s;e as others, in two different ways, <HI>young</HI> and <HI>old.</HI> Beef, compared with mutton, is of a more firm texture, and le&s;s &s;oluble, but I am per&s;uaded is equally alkale&s;cent, per&s;pirable, and nutritious: If, in the &s;outhern countries, it is not e&s;teemed &s;o, it is on account of its imperfection there, as already ob&s;erved. With regard to young and old foods, a great deal has been already &s;aid: I &s;hall confirm that here, with an ob&s;ervation on our u&s;e of <HI>veal.</HI> If we were purely to con&s;ider tenderne&s;s of texture, the younge&s;t animals certainly would always be preferred; but you ob&s;erve, that we u&s;e veal at a certain age, and perhaps the rea&s;on of it may be this; when an animal is very young, although its fibres, taken by them&s;elves are more tender, yet, on account of their great connec|tion and complication, they are le&s;s &s;oluble; whereas, in the &s;pace of a month or two, by proper nouri&s;hment, the fibres come to be more and more &s;eparated, a greater quantity of cellular &s;ub&s;tance is interpo&s;ed, and they are rendered more &s;oluble and nutritious: Now, after this period, perhaps after the third month, the animal's nature tends towards robu&s;tne&s;s, firmne&s;s, and rigidity, becoming more fibrous again, and more difficultly di&s;&s;olved. When an animal is very young, we commonly have an aver&s;ion to it; the whole of it then is, as it were, a &s;emifluid ma&s;s, which we cannot take in &s;uf|ficient quantity, and which, from its watery con&s;i&s;tence, mu&s;t be but little nutritious.</P>

<HEAD>HARE.</HEAD>
<P>This animal is much exerci&s;ed, and thereby acquires a great firm|ne&s;s of fibres; and, though &s;ufficiently alkale&s;cent, and killed in the blood, is yet of difficult &s;olubility. As the tenderne&s;s of meats de|pends on the &s;ucculency of the mu&s;cular parts, the hare killed after a long chace, when much of the oil of the body is ab&s;orbed, is much firmer and tougher than when killed in the &s;eat.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="food">
<HEAD>RABBIT.</HEAD>
<P>This animal is of very little exerci&s;e, moderately alkale&s;cent, and one of the white meats without vi&s;cidity. Whether on the&s;e ac|counts, or &s;ome particulars in its oeconomy, I have always found it one of the lighte&s;t and mo&s;t &s;oluble animal foods.</P>
<P>Next <HI>Lepus,</HI> in the Catalogue, is placed the term, <HI>Sus,</HI> Hog.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="food">
<HEAD>HOG; PORK.</HEAD>
<P>This animal is of a peculiar make, and difficultly reduced to any particular order, placed, however, among the <HI>Mammalia Be&s;tiae</HI> of Linnaeus. It is the only dome&s;tic animal that I know, of no u&s;e to man when alive, and therefore properly de&s;igned for food. Be&s;ides, as loath&s;ome and ugly to every human eye, it is killed without reluctance. The Pythagoreans, whether to pre&s;erve health, or on account of compa&s;&s;ion, generally forbid the u&s;e of animal food, and yet it is alledged that Pythagoras re&s;erved the u&s;e of hogs fle&s;h for him&s;elf.

or of the precept given to &s;ome of them, though commonly &s;uch as are not given without a particular one. The Greeks gave great commendations to this food; and Galen, though indeed that is &s;u&s;|pected to be from a particular fondne&s;s, is every where full of it. The Romans con&s;idered it as one of their delicacies; and if &s;ome of the inhabitants of the northern climates have taken an aver&s;ion to it, that probably aro&s;e from the uncultivated &s;tate of their country not being able to rear it. Pork is of a very tender &s;tructure, encrea&s;ed perhaps from a peculiarity in its oeconomy, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> taking on fat more readily than any other animal. Pork is a white meat even in its adult &s;tate, and then gives out a jelly in very great quantity. On account of its little per&s;pirability and tenderne&s;s, it is very nutritious, and was given for that intention to the <HI>athletae.</HI> With regard to its alkale&s;cency, no proper experiments have yet been made, but as it is of a gelatinous and &s;ucculent nature, it is probably le&s;s &s;o than many others.</P>
<P>Many others of the <HI>Mammalia,</HI> or Quadrupeds, are u&s;ed in different countries, and it is not certain which of the Quadrupeds may be ex|cepted from the rule. Thus the Tartars eat hor&s;es, the Romans ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;&s;es, dogs, rats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but of the&s;e, as we have no experience, little can be &s;aid, though their qualities may probably be under&s;tood from the principles already delivered.</P>
<P>We now come to con&s;ider the Cla&s;s of BIRDS, which is di|vided into &s;ix orders, <HI>Accipitres, Picae, An&s;eres, Grallae, Gallinae,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;eres.</HI> The <HI>Accipitres</HI> and <HI>Picae</HI> are carnivorous Birds, and not u&s;ed by us, or indeed much by any nation in food. The other four are what are chiefly u&s;ed, of which we have begun with the <HI>Gallinae,</HI> as the chief of our dome&s;tic fowl; and of the&s;e the fir&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Gallus Gallinaceus,</HI> is comprehended by Linnaeus, under the general name of <HI>Pha&s;ianus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="014000_0136_0F9286555BB48398">
The COCK, HEN, CHICKEN, and CAPON, are entirely dome&s;tic animals, there being no country, as far as I know, in which they are found wild. They take little exerci&s;e, live mo&s;tly on vegetables, though &s;ometimes, indeed, they pick up in&s;ects, and are chiefly delighted with grain. Hence they are a food of tender &s;tructure, ea&s;y &s;olution, little alkale&s;cency, and, as a white meat, gelatinous. When very young, they are extremely vi&s;cid, when old, tough and ligamentous; &s;o that the proper time of u&s;ing them is in a middle &s;tate, between the&s;e two extremes, <HI>i. e.</HI> when about a year old.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion here ari&s;es about the feeding of animals, it being doubted whether a crammed, or barn-door fowl, is preferable. Many of our modern arts of feeding, be&s;ides giving more &s;ucculency and ten|derne&s;s to the food, encrea&s;e its alkale&s;cency: As giving &s;ucculency, they are an improvement, but, as giving alkale&s;cency, a dangerous one, though even with that they make &s;olution more ea&s;y. Exerci&s;e, however, is nece&s;&s;ary to give perfection, for, by this means, the fat of the animal is equally di&s;per&s;ed through the mu&s;cular parts, whereas, when the animal is fatted ha&s;tily, the fat is accumulated in a particular part, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in the cellular texture, more &s;trictly &s;o called; &s;o that an exerci&s;ed animal of equal weight, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> with a fed one, is much preferable.</P>
<P>The next bird mentioned in the Catalogue, is The MELEAGRIS GALLOPAVO. another of the <HI>Galinae,</HI> under the generical name of <HI>Meleagris.</HI> The <HI>Meleagris Gallopavo,</HI> or turkey, with regard to its qualities in food, is entirely the &s;ame as the proceeding, being equally tender, &s;oluble, and alkale&s;cent.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="014000_0137_0F9286575121C1E8">
The next bird we come to, is The PAVO CRISTATUS, or PEACOCK, which is &s;omewhat of a white fle&s;h, but firm and rigid, and partly from the coar&s;ene&s;s of its texture, and partly from its not being pro|lific, is now properly enough neglected. The Romans formerly u&s;ed, but probably only for &s;how, our Peacock as food. It was remarked that the boiled Peacock would keep very long; but in this there is nothing extraordinary, as was imagined; for the mo&s;t pu|tre&s;cent part of the food is the fluid, and this, by boiling, is ex|tracted, and leaves only the &s;olid fibres behind. Now, if what is called jerking of beef in the We&s;t-Indies, or hand-roa&s;ting it, in both which ca&s;es the fluids are not &s;o accurately drawn out, have the effect of pre&s;erving meat for a con&s;iderable time, how much greater mu&s;t that effect be expected to be from the more rigid texture of the Peacock, ex&s;uccated by boiling.</P>

<HEAD>PHEASANT.</HEAD>
<P>Next the Peacock &s;hould have been in&s;erted the Phea&s;ant, as it is the fir&s;t among the wild fowl; but becau&s;e Linnaeus has given <HI>Pha|&s;ianus</HI> as his generical name for the <HI>Gallus Gallinaceus,</HI> &amp;c. it was omitted: Here, however, it &s;hall be mentioned, as it is in its proper place. The Phea&s;ant is a wild fowl, is more exerci&s;ed, and hence, and from its living on the drier vegetables, and in&s;ects, more alkale&s;cent than the &s;ame fowl, and al&s;o, from its being capable of fattening, is more &s;oluble.</P>
<P>The five following belong all to one genus, the <HI>Tetrao</HI> of Linnaeus. The two fir&s;t,

TETRAO PERDIX <HI>et</HI> COTURNIX, <HI>i. e.</HI> the PARTRIDGE and QUAIL, approach in their nature to the tame fowl, but are more &s;apid, ten|der and alkale&s;cent, the chief cau&s;e of difference re&s;iding in the alka|le&s;cency.</P>
<P>The three la&s;t, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>The LAGOPUS, TETRIX et UROGALLUS, as living more on in&s;ects, are more alkale&s;cent than the two former, much more &s;o than the tame fowl.</P>
<P>In following Linnaeus, I have omitted The GROUSE, or RED GAME, which, however, I meant to comprehend under the term <HI>Lagopus;</HI> although Linnaeus does not &s;eem to be acquainted with our red game, which, however, is the <HI>Lagopus</HI> of other Naturali&s;ts, and the <HI>Lagopus altera Plinii.</HI> The qualities of the&s;e are very much in common. From its &s;ize, rather than any real difference, is, I ima|gine, the black game thought more firm, tho' perhaps, from its living on very high mountains, it is &s;eldomer got young. I have men|tioned young food as vi&s;cid and gelatinous, but the&s;e of which we are &s;peaking are not &s;o, which is an exception to the general rule, and which I impute to the greater alkale&s;cency of the kind.</P>

<HEAD>ANSERES.</HEAD>
<P>Next in order come the <HI>An&s;eres</HI> of Linnaeus, which term may properly be tran&s;lated Water Fowl.</P>
<P>From their nature, the water fowl are much exerci&s;ed, and being

generally carnivorous, are more alkale&s;cent than the tame; whether they are more &s;o than the wild fowl, is undetermined. Certain however it is, that, whether from their le&s;s alkale&s;cency, or peculiar nature, they are le&s;s &s;oluble than the&s;e, &s;o that if we here appre|hend a greater alkale&s;cency, we mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e a greater vi&s;cidity, which indeed they generally po&s;&s;e&s;s more than the wild fowl.</P>

<HEAD>ANAS DOMESTICA, the TAME DUCK.</HEAD>
<P>Here Naturali&s;ts commonly have, although different in their manner of living, con&s;idered the tame and wild animal as the &s;ame: However that may hold in natural hi&s;tory, we mu&s;t make a difference in their qualities, as food. The wild duck is more alkale&s;|cent, more tender, and more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved than the tame, and, in general, this difference takes place between wild and tame ani|mals, if they are taken at a &s;uitable age and proper &s;ea&s;on. Old animals are generally more alkale&s;cent and more ea&s;ily &s;oluble than the young: Many animals, however, are not vi&s;cid when young, &s;o that, in this ca&s;e, the rule in contradicted. All wild animals too, differ according to the &s;ea&s;on, either from the time of their molting or the quantity of food they then get.</P>

<HEAD>Of QUALITIES of FISHES in general.</HEAD>
<P>Their <HI>texture</HI> is generally more tender than that of Fle&s;h, and they have nothing of a fibrous &s;tructure. With re&s;pect to their <HI>&s;olution,</HI> after all, the matter does not &s;eem determined; for from Geoffroy's experiments it appears, that they give le&s;s &s;oluble matter out of the body than fle&s;h. It is however very probable, that the powers of our &s;tomach, the fermentation which is excited there, exceeds greatly any power we can apply out of the body; and, &s;o far as we are able to judge, they are of more ea&s;y &s;olution than Fle&s;h meats. Broths, however, of Fi&s;hes do not form into a jelly, though there is &s;omewhat gluey and vi&s;cid, which, like the young meats, makes them long retained in the &s;tomach; yet, after all, I do not find, that even in this ca&s;e of their longer retention and dif|ficult per&s;pirability, that by ruminant men, if I may &s;o call them, they are &s;o often brought up as other foods.</P>
<P>The alkale&s;cency of Fi&s;hes &s;eems le&s;s than that of Meats, their putrefaction being flower, and their yield of volatile alkali le&s;s. There is in the &s;olution of this food &s;omething particular, which is not yet properly enquired into. We u&s;e oil or butter &s;ometimes with our vegetable aliment, oftner with meats, but more frequently &s;till, and in greater quantity, with Fi&s;hes. This certainly, if pro|perly under&s;tood, would throw &s;ome light on &s;olution of this ali|ment, as it &s;eems to be a rule followed from &s;ome in&s;tigation of in&s;tinct, rather than precept of rea&s;on. I formerly &s;poke of the <HI>&s;timulus</HI> given to the &s;tomach by the alkale&s;cency of meats, which, at the &s;ame time, I told you might be produced by vi&s;cidity and long retention there. In the fi&s;h kind this is more remarkable, they being a very &s;hort time in the &s;tomach before they produce heat, fever, thir&s;t, and &s;ometimes efflore&s;cences over the whole &s;urface of the body.</P>

In order to the under&s;tanding the qualities of Fi&s;hes, they have been con&s;idered as differing in being River or Sea Fi&s;h, <HI>Saxatiles</HI> or <HI>Limo&s;ae, i. e.</HI> tho&s;e living in gravelly bottoms, or &s;uch as, like the Lamprey, lie at the bottom, in the mud, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But in neither of the&s;e divi&s;ions do I find any certain foundation for a&s;certaining the difference of Fi&s;hes as aliment. Dr. Cheyne was extremely fond of the di&s;tinction by Colour, the White being &s;uppo&s;ed le&s;s &s;timulant, and the Red more &s;o. In Birds and Quadrupeds this, indeed, will hold; but there are, except the Salmon, few Fi&s;hes but what are of a white colour, &s;o that this di&s;tinction will go but a little way. As we found a difference in other aliment from a difference of food, the &s;ame would &s;eem to take place in Fi&s;hes, all of whom are mo&s;tly carni|vorous; nor does any difference in the kind of animals they eat &s;eem to make any difference in their qualities: The Perch, <HI>e. g.</HI> who eats mites, fi&s;hes, in&s;ects indifferently, and all of them rapaciou&s;ly, and indeed, be&s;ides, water fowl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is not more alkale&s;cent than tho&s;e who live on in&s;ects alone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor indeed are they to be di&s;tingui&s;hed entirely from their different <HI>genera,</HI> though that indeed comes neare&s;t the truth of any other of the di&s;tinctions.

With regard to the &s;nail, it has the general qualities of the Worms in a high degree, of a tender texture, ea&s;ily &s;oluble, but vi&s;cid and imper&s;pirable. The Garden Snail is not known here as food, but in &s;ome of the &s;outhern countries it is reckoned a deli|cacy, and very nouri&s;hing food. Our own &s;nails are &s;ometimes boiled in milk and employed as a medicine in hectic ca&s;es, and I my&s;elf have &s;een remarkable advantage from them where there were no ulcerations, they &s;oon recruiting the emaciated habit; but in ca&s;e of ulcerations, the&s;e, as well as all other animal food, are very improper. A remarkable in&s;tance of the nutritious quality of Snails appears in the famine, which happened in this country about &s;ixty years ago, of two girls being found to be remarkably nouri&s;hed from &s;nails alone, while others of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;ort were meagre and half-&s;tarved.</P>

<HEAD>EGGS of BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e might have been &s;et down after the Birds, but, as they are &s;omewhat analogous to the la&s;t mentioned food, I have placed them here. It is obvious, from their nature and u&s;e in the nou|ri&s;hment of the <HI>foetus,</HI> that they contain a larger proportion of pure nutriment than any other aliment, as they give no <HI>foeces;</HI> for every other kind of animal food has &s;ome of its juices gone farther to putrefaction than the <HI>albumen,</HI> which is extracted in our &s;tomach, which are depo&s;ited in that form. After all, Eggs are not of ea&s;y dige&s;tion, and, from the proportion of nouri&s;hment they afford, cannot be taken in large quantity. Whether the difficulty of di|ge&s;tion in Eggs re&s;ides naturally in the vi&s;cidity of the <HI>albumen,</HI> or, in the coagulated &s;tate in which we take it in, is a que&s;tion; it &s;eems at lea&s;t to be encrea&s;ed by coagulation, as the harde&s;t Egg is mo&s;t difficult of dige&s;tion. I do not think the in&s;olubility re&s;ides in the Yolk, as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed, for I have known per&s;ons reject the White, and live on the Yolk entirely, which is of different qua|lities and de&s;igned for an after-food. I have already mentioned the in&s;olubility of the <HI>albumen ovi</HI> out of the body, by heat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;aid it could only depend on fermentation. Eggs approach to the <HI>Vermes</HI> in vi&s;cidity and difficult per&s;pirability; they are le&s;s alkale&s;|cent than Fle&s;h, &s;ome of who&s;e juices have always proceeded too far. A proof of the little alkale&s;cency of Eggs, is from their being the Animal Food lea&s;t apt to pall. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed bad qua|lities,
<PB N="149" REF="014000_0155_0F928668275EACA0">
but I know no in&s;tance of any: They are &s;ometimes noxious to certain per&s;ons, but this we mu&s;t explain from an idio&s;yncra&s;y.</P>
<P>This is all that occurs on the &s;ubject of Eggs. I &s;hould next go on to con&s;ider medicines, but, before that, &s;hall recapitulate a little what has been &s;aid on the &s;ubject of Aliment. From the whole you will perceive, that Aliment is divided into Vegetable and Animal, and that Milk is of an intermediate nature between both, ace&s;cent as the vegetable, but not liable to its noxious ace&s;cency; nouri&s;hing as the Animal, though not liable to its noxious alkale&s;cency. The ace&s;|cent Vegetable Aliment &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the human oeconomy, and there are none of the human &s;pecies but what em|ploy it. How far we could di&s;pen&s;e with Animal Food is uncertain; it &s;eems rather u&s;eful than nece&s;&s;ary, in order to give great &s;trength, and for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and long duration of life little proper. Farther, the Vegetable Aliment is never hurtful, except in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and in the&s;e only of the di&s;ea&s;ed: Its effects never appear in the blood-ve&s;&s;els. On the contrary, Animal Food, which is more nouri&s;hing, ea&s;ily goes to exce&s;s, and expo&s;es to danger, readily, by its alkale&s;cency, laying the foundation of di&s;ea&s;es, and as well as its other qualities, <HI>e. g.</HI> corpulency, obe&s;ity, and putre&s;cent acrimony.</P>

regulated by our appetite, as in the quality, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> a large proportion of Vegetable Aliment. So much in general. Vegetable Aliment con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ugar and oil, both &s;eparately nutritious, but in that &s;tate liable to di&s;advantages. Sugar is of difficult a&s;&s;imilation, e&s;pecially if its acid is evolved; as then, like the recent fruits, it will be a pro|per &s;ubject for the vinous fermentation. Oil is more difficultly mixed, and oily foods more &s;o in proportion, as that is more &s;eparate. The <HI>Farinacea,</HI> where the oil and &s;ugar are intimately blended, are the mo&s;t perfect of Vegetable Aliment, and of the&s;e the <HI>Cerealia,</HI> as you will now ea&s;ily know from their qualities.</P>
<P>Animal food differs in alkale&s;cency and vi&s;cidity. The Quadru|peds and Birds are the mo&s;t alkale&s;cent, the Fi&s;hes and Vermes the mo&s;t vi&s;cid. Alkale&s;cency &s;eems to depend on the heat of the ani|mal. The Quadrupeds and Birds have the greate&s;t heat, the Fi&s;hes and worms lea&s;t. A farther proof of the le&s;s alkale&s;cency of Fi&s;hes is, that with Animal Food we are con&s;tantly led by in&s;tinct to take in Vegetable Aliment. The &s;ame in&s;tinct has never led us to take it in with Fi&s;hes. For experiment &s;ake, I have &s;ometimes taken Ap|ples along with Fi&s;h, and found them to di&s;turb dige&s;tion. The fle&s;h of Quadrupeds and Birds is, on account of its alkale&s;cency, more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved, and &s;ooner a&s;&s;imilated into blood, giving ea&s;ie&s;t nouri&s;hment and &s;trength, while on the &s;ame account it is wi&s;ely or|dained that it is &s;ooner expelled. Fi&s;hes and worms, on account of their vi&s;cidity, are more difficultly di&s;&s;olved and a&s;&s;imilated, retained longer in the &s;y&s;tem, and only heating from their retention, and thus even accumulating the fluids, and affording nouri&s;hment to the &s;olid parts.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE VIRTUES OF MEDICINES.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING fini&s;hed the &s;ubject of Aliments, I proceed in the next place to con&s;ider <HI>Medicines.</HI> As introductory to this, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to tell you the manner of inve&s;tigating their virtues. As the foundation of what I have to &s;ay on this, I &s;hall ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the following Canon from Linnaeus, in his <HI>Materia Medica: Sy&s;te|mate, Qualitate, et Experientia cruitur omnis u&s;us Plantarum.</HI></P>
<P>What he here applies to Vegetables, will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;uit the other Kingdoms. The two fir&s;t qualities he explains more fully in his <HI>Philo&s;ophia Botanica,</HI> where he employs the term <HI>Fructification,</HI> which is the &s;ame with the term <HI>Sy&s;tem;</HI> for according to the fruc|tification, are plants &s;y&s;tematically di&s;po&s;ed. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> giving the qualities of Aliment, I have often alluded to its place in Natural Hi&s;tory, and &s;hall be obliged hereafter to do &s;o more in giving the qualities of Medicine. This method of inve&s;tigating the virtues from the Bota|nical Divi&s;ions, was long &s;ince &s;tarted by Hoffman, in his treati&s;e <HI>De compendio&s;o methodo, &amp;c.</HI> and before him by our countryman Dr. Blair, in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, &amp;c.</HI> The Botanical Rules are, however, far from being general; but, as far as they go, they &s;erve very well for analogy, and it is on this account we &s;hall often have recour&s;e to them. But before you can be acquainted with the&s;e Rules, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give you an idea of Method in Natural Hi&s;tory in general.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="014000_0158_0F92866A2D661200">
Method in Natural Hi&s;tory in general, is that by which a pro|duction of Nature being pre&s;ented, we can proceed to know how it can be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other productions of Nature, and the name by which <HI>Writers</HI> have di&s;tingui&s;hed it, in order that, by this means, we may arrive at a knowledge of its nature, qualities, and virtues. This is done by collecting natural productions into King|doms, Cla&s;&s;es, Orders, <HI>Genera,</HI> and Species. As to the fir&s;t divi|&s;ion, if a &s;ubject were pre&s;ented to me, in which I could ob&s;erve no proper organization, no difference between the containing and con|tained parts, I would conclude it to be of the <HI>Mineral</HI> or <HI>Fo&s;&s;ile Kingdom.</HI> A Fo&s;&s;ile al&s;o has no appearance of the <HI>vita multiplicata,</HI> or power of propagating its like. But if there be a difference be|tween the containing and contained parts, and if it have the power of multiplying it&s;elf, I conclude it is either of the <HI>Animal,</HI> or <HI>Vege|table Kingdom.</HI> Again, to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e, if I find the &s;ubject fixed, or, when moved, to have no locomotive power, or arbitrary means of moving it&s;elf, I conclude our &s;ubject to be Vegetable; for Animals are organized bodies, endued with <HI>vita multiplicata</HI> and a locomotive power, or, if fixed, have the arbitrary power of moving their parts. The&s;e are the large&s;t collections, and are called KINGDOMS.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e is again &s;ubdivided into Cla&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In order to give a notion of the&s;e, it will be ea&s;ie&s;t to take examples from the Animal Kingdom; as with that you mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be already ac|quainted. The Animal Kingdom is divided into &s;ix <HI>Cla&s;&s;es.</HI> Lin|naeus has fir&s;t attempted a divi&s;ion of them into three; from the &s;tructure of their heart, and the heat and colour of the blood. The fir&s;t have a heart of two ventricles, and two auricles, and a warm red blood; the &s;econd have a heart of one ventricle, and one auricle, with a cold red blood; the third have a heart of one auricle, and one ventricle, with a cold white blood, or, as Linnaeus calls it, <HI>&s;anies.</HI> If we were to examine the&s;e &s;trictly, I believe they would not an|&s;wer &s;o well; &s;o I rather chu&s;e to take the &s;ix &s;ubdivi&s;ions; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Mammalia, Aves, Amphibia, Pi&s;ces, In&s;ecta, Vermes.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="153" REF="014000_0159_0F92866AED7FA0F8">
1. The <HI>Mammalia</HI> have a heart with two auricles, and two ven|tricles, with a warm red blood, are nece&s;&s;arily breathing, having their re&s;piration alternate, &s;ucceeding in a &s;hort time; <HI>maxillae incum|bentes,</HI> or jaws laid horizontally on each other; in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e which open laterally, and the&s;e jaws always covered; <HI>penis intrans,</HI> or the parts of generation of the male entering the female, who is always viviparous, provided with brea&s;ts, and &s;uckles her young.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Aves,</HI> &s;ame heart and re&s;piration as the <HI>Mammalia; maxillae incumbentes,</HI> but not covered, <HI>ex&s;ertae,</HI> or having the <HI>maxillae</HI> &s;tretch|ed, without the parts of the head; <HI>edentulae,</HI> or without teeth; the male, too, enters the female, but are without external te&s;ticles. Their females are oviparous, and have their eggs covered with a calcarious cru&s;t. The whole of them are always covered with feathers, and have only two feet. I &s;hall give the rea&s;on why I did not u&s;e this in the di&s;tinction of the <HI>Mammalia,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that it did not &s;uit to all of them; &s;ome having, and &s;ome wanting, four feet.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Amphibia,</HI> have a heart of one ventricle, and one auricle, with a cold red blood. There is &s;ome doubt with regard to the univer&s;a|lity of di&s;tingui&s;hing them by one auricle, and one ventricle; but the exceptions are not certain. When I &s;ay a <HI>cold,</HI> I mean one not much warmer than the &s;urrounding medium, whether that be air or water. They have lungs with which they breathe arbitrarily; they agree with the two former in <HI>maxillae incumbentes;</HI> they have two <HI>peni&s;es:</HI> The females are generally oviparous, though not always &s;o; when they are, their <HI>ova</HI> are covered only with a membrane.

<P N="4">4. <HI>Fi&s;hes;</HI> one auricle, and one ventricle, with the &s;ame blood as the <HI>Amphibia.</HI> They differ from the three former, in not being breathing animals; but in&s;tead of lungs are provided with <HI>bronchiae,</HI> which alternately take in and let out water, in&s;tead of air. They have <HI>maxillae incumbentes,</HI> no <HI>penis,</HI> all are oviparous,
<PB N="154" REF="014000_0160_0F92866BB1E26E78">
and their eggs are &s;aid to want an <HI>albumen;</HI> a fact which I am very aver&s;e to believe. As to their <HI>tegmenta,</HI> their &s;kin is univer&s;ally covered with &s;cales, and they have fins with which they &s;wim.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>In&s;ecta;</HI> heart with one auricle and one ventricle, hardly a coloured fluid for blood. As to their re&s;piration it is uncertain; they have no lungs, but are &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;omewhat analogous to them, <HI>maxillae laterales, penis intrans;</HI> they are generally oviparous, whether univer&s;ally is yet undetermined. I believe they are not. As to teguments, they are covered with a hard &s;helly &s;ub&s;tance, <HI>cataphracta,</HI> or coat of mail. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the other Cla&s;&s;es by their <HI>Antennae,</HI> i. e. horns, or feelers, for di|recting their way, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but, indeed, we are not at all certain of their u&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Vermes.</HI> The&s;e have a heart with one ventricle, and one auricle, <HI>&s;anie frigida.</HI> With regard to their re&s;piration nothing is determined, as they appear to have nothing analogous to it. As to their jaws they are various. As to their <HI>tegmenta</HI> they are never covered with &s;hells; &s;ometimes, indeed, they have a calcarious cover|ing, &s;eparable from the body, and di&s;tinct from it; they have neither feet nor fins.</P>
<P>This is a &s;pecimen of our method of di&s;tingui&s;hing into <HI>Cla&s;&s;es.</HI> The&s;e Cla&s;&s;es are divided into orders. Of the <HI>Orders</HI> we &s;hall give you an example in the <HI>Mammalia.</HI></P>
<P>Of the <HI>Mammalia</HI> there are eight Orders. The fir&s;t Order is, &s;o many of Quadrupeds, and others which are not, but in&s;tead of feet have fins with which they &s;wim, and are inhabitants of the water: They have the other general qualities of the <HI>Mammalia.</HI> The&s;e make a di&s;tinct Order, the <HI>Cete.</HI> The Quadrupeds are divided into the other &s;even Orders, according to the &s;tate of their teeth. 1. Tho&s;e which have no fore teeth below or above, are called <HI>Bruta.</HI> Tho&s;e which have them below and not above, are
<PB N="155" REF="014000_0161_0F92866C6BA946D0">
the <HI>Pecora.</HI> Tho&s;e which have only two fore teeth above and below, without laniary, are called <HI>Glires,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>But to take them in the order which Linnaeus has placed them: 1. <HI>Primates</HI> have four upper teeth, &s;ingle <HI>canini,</HI> or laniary. 2. <HI>Bruta</HI> have no fore teeth above or below. 3. <HI>Ferae</HI> have fore teeth both above and below; &s;ix above, and all of them acute and &s;harp, with &s;ingle <HI>canini.</HI> 4. <HI>Be&s;tiae;</HI> the&s;e have always more then one canine tooth in each jaw. 5. The <HI>Glires</HI> we have mentioned al|ready; as al&s;o, 6. The <HI>Pecora.</HI> 7. The <HI>Belluae</HI> have &s;everal fore teeth, which are blunted and obtu&s;e.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Orders,</HI> the next divi&s;ion is into <HI>Genera;</HI> of which I &s;hall give you an example in the <HI>Pecora,</HI> with which you are be&s;t acquainted. The ordinal character was taken from the teeth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the generical characters are taken from the horns. The <HI>Pecora</HI> comprehends &s;ix <HI>Genera,</HI> the Camel, the Mu&s;k Deer, the Sheep, the Ox, the Stag, and Goat. The two fir&s;t have no horns; the four la&s;t are horned. The Stag has &s;olid horns without a hollow, branching backwards; the other three have their horns hollowed, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the direction of the&s;e horns. The cow kind have their horns turned forwards, <HI>(porrecta)</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Vide Linnaei Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> vol. I. La&s;tly, the <HI>Genera</HI> are divided into &s;pecies, which are individuals which Nature has created. Of the&s;e I &s;hall give you an example in the Camel. The whole &s;pecies is not known. Four are mentioned by Linnaeus: The Camel, Dromedary, <HI>Glama,</HI> and <HI>Pacos.</HI> The Camel has only one bunch, the Dromedary two, the <HI>Glama</HI> has no &s;uch bunch on the back, but one on the brea&s;t; the <HI>Pacos</HI> has no &s;uch tophy, or bunches at all, and is more di&s;tinctly covered with wool. Now to go backwards, and give an example of the whole. Suppo&s;e an unknown animal, <HI>e. g.</HI> the <HI>Pacos,</HI> was pre|&s;ented. From its four feet we reduce it to the cla&s;s of the <HI>Mammalia,</HI> from having no teeth in the upper jaw, we trace it to the <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Pecora,</HI> from having no horns, we range it in the fir&s;t or &s;econd <HI>Genus</HI> of tho&s;e, we determine it to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, from its having
<PB N="156" REF="014000_0162_0F92866F65FF2088">
more than one <HI>laniarius,</HI> or canine tooth, and la&s;tly, from its being without <HI>tophi,</HI> and more di&s;tinctly covered with wool, we bring it to the <HI>Pacos,</HI> the fourth &s;pecies of the Camel. When we have thus got its name, we look into books, and find its nature, hi&s;tory, and qualities. You &s;ee, then, how u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, although &s;eem|ingly laborious, this method of Natural Hi&s;tory is. From what I have &s;aid, you will under&s;tand what I mean by deducing the virtues of Medicines, from the place they have in Natural Hi&s;tory; al|though to confirm you in it, more practice will be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>We have now &s;poken of Kingdoms, Cla&s;&s;es, Orders, Genera, and Species. This la&s;t is divided into <HI>Varieties.</HI> That is a Variety where the differences or marks by which it is known are not inherent in the &s;ubject, but depend on the &s;oil, climate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This takes place in the Animal Kingdom, but is much more remarkable in the Ve|getable. In the la&s;t a variety is di&s;tingui&s;hed in this way, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> if the &s;eed put into the ground does not propagate the &s;ame variety, but comes up agreeing with the &s;pecies. Now to go on with this &s;ubject a little further. I mu&s;t inform you, the Method in Natural Hi&s;tory is far from being perfect: For many di&s;putes &s;ub&s;i&s;t among Naturali&s;ts, about the Cla&s;&s;es and Orders to which &s;ubjects ought to be reduced. This depends on the characters a&s;&s;umed for arranging them at fir&s;t; <HI>e. g.</HI> If I were to give flying as the fundamental cha|racteri&s;tic of a bird, this would not be perfect, becau&s;e there are flying <HI>Amphibia,</HI> &amp;c. We much better than with Linnaeus fix the character from the feathers, legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the fir&s;t method the Bat would be ranked among the Birds: But when we find that it has four feet, is viviparous, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is properly placed among the Qua|drupeds. Di&s;putes of this kind have often occured, and Linnaeus him&s;elf is an example of this. Formerly, <HI>e. g.</HI> the <HI>Cete</HI> was ranked among the Fi&s;hes, as an inhabitant of the water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but now, Linnaeus con&s;idering that, excepting in this re&s;pect, it agreed entirely with the <HI>Mammalia,</HI> he has very properly ranked it among them; in which opinion Ray long ago agreed with him. In &s;hort, if we a&s;&s;ume as the fundamental character of Fi&s;hes, that they are inha|bitants
<PB N="157" REF="014000_0163_0F92866F993579D8">
of the water, we &s;hall take in many <HI>amphibia,</HI> worms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into the &s;ame Order. We mu&s;t have regard to other qualities, as the &s;tructure of the heart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before mentioned.</P>
<P>There &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t many &s;uch di&s;putes among Naturali&s;ts, with regard to every one of the divi&s;ions I &s;poke of; <HI>e. g.</HI> Klein, of Dantzick, divides Animals according to their claws, while Linnaeus's divi&s;ion you know, is according to the teeth. The Camel, with Linnaeus, is in the order of the <HI>Pecora;</HI> with Klein among the Animals of two claws. Linnaeus very properly ranked the Camel with the <HI>Pecora,</HI> for be&s;ides the external &s;tructure, it agrees with the re&s;t of its rank in the internal, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> &s;tomach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereas merely on account of an agreement in claws, by Klein it is ranked among animals, otherwi&s;e e&s;&s;entially different. This leads you to under&s;tand the difference between natural and artificial order in Natural Hi&s;tory. That method is artificial, which brings together Cla&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> merely from one &s;ingle arbitrary mark, or one that &s;eemed mo&s;t convenient in di&s;tributing the&s;e Cla&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That method natural, which brings into Cla&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;uch &s;ubjects as have the greate&s;t number of marks or characters in common. The arti|ficial method, although &s;ometimes it may more ea&s;ily enable us to di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>genera,</HI> is yet, on the whole, very trouble&s;ome and confounding; and univer&s;ally, the method which in Natural Hi&s;tory is mo&s;t natural, will be in practice of the ea&s;ie&s;t applica|tion; for be&s;ides collecting &s;ub&s;tances, which agree in external marks, it places together tho&s;e who&s;e internal properties are in common. There are few &s;y&s;tems where we can pre&s;erve the natural method. The <HI>Mammalia</HI> of Linnaeus is a very natural Cla&s;s, as indeed mo&s;t of his Cla&s;&s;es are; but of this Cla&s;s there are no natural orders, but the <HI>Pecora</HI> and <HI>Cete.</HI> The <HI>Ferae</HI> are nearly &s;o, but all the re&s;t are artificial di&s;tributions; <HI>e. g.</HI> in the <HI>Primates,</HI> which order comprehends Man, the Monkey is properly enough &s;et down; for, be&s;ides having four teeth above, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it re&s;embles in other internal properties; but the addition of the Bat, which agrees with the re&s;t of the order only by its teeth, is certainly very unna|tural.
<PB N="158" REF="014000_0164_0F9286707088E570">
In his other Orders, the &s;ame difficulty is often found, to which only the &s;ubject of Quadrupeds, by attempting to reduce the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to a few Orders (in which, indeed, he is much to be com|mended) he is perpetually expo&s;ed. Other examples will occur to you, upon looking into the &s;y&s;tem, as in his placing the Hor&s;e in the &s;ame genus with the <HI>Hippopotamus,</HI> merely on account of its teeth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To apply all this to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, which was in giving this &s;ketch of Method in Natural Hi&s;tory, chiefly to make you under&s;tand the difference between natural and artificial method.</P>
<P>Vegetables, in the &s;ame manner as Animals, are divided into Cla&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In every botanical method care has been taken to a&s;&s;ume a natural one; but in none has it yet been perfectly obtained: And plants of di&s;&s;imilar qualities in nature are often a&s;&s;ociated together, merely <HI>lege &s;y&s;tematis</HI> as they &s;peak. The inve&s;tigation of the virtues of plants, from the &s;y&s;tem, is thus &s;poke of by Linnaeus, in his <HI>Philo&s;ophia Botanica. Plantae quae genere conveniunt virtute etiam</HI> conveniunt, <HI>quae in ordine</HI> naturali <HI>conveniunt</HI> virtute proprius accedunt, <HI>quae cla&s;&s;e</HI> naturali <HI>conveniunt virtutibus quodam modo con|gruunt.</HI> This rule is more exact as you advance to the lowe&s;t di&s;tributions, for in Nature there is no di&s;tribution certain, but that of &s;pecies; even tho&s;e of <HI>genera</HI> are much more artificial; and the higher you ari&s;e always more &s;o; and for the application of this rule, as you &s;ee Linnaeus has carefully marked, you mu&s;t alone have re|cour&s;e to the <HI>natural</HI> divi&s;ions. He has given the&s;e, independent of his Cla&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in his <HI>Philo&s;ophia Botanica,</HI> in what he calls his <HI>Fragmenta Methodi Naturalis.</HI> For our purpo&s;e, then, you mu&s;t only &s;tudy Natural Hi&s;tory in this way, and you may always allow, I mean mo&s;tly, that tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, which are in the &s;ame natural order, are &s;omewhat of corre&s;ponding virtues.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Jalap, Mechoacan,</HI> &amp;c. are very properly ranged together. In looking over Linnaeus's li&s;t, I find the majority he puts together
<PB N="159" REF="014000_0165_0F928670F19BEF98">
are of the &s;ame virtues, and perhaps &s;hould find &s;till more, if they were all employed in medicine. But often there are exceptions, and Linnaeus ranges &s;everal, not without doubt, or <HI>punctum interro|gandi?</HI> So much may be &s;aid in favour of the general rule. But although as an analogy it will &s;erve to direct in the beginning of &s;tudy, yet afterwards, on applying it to particular purpo&s;es, it is found to be fallacious; &s;o that always we &s;hould be on our guard in u&s;ing it. Cinnamon, Camphire, and Benzoin are ranged toge|ther under the <HI>genus laurus.</HI> All the&s;e, indeed, agree in <HI>aroma,</HI> but their particular virtues are very different. Many examples of the &s;ame kind occur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;t of the <HI>Sedums</HI> are mild, but there is one very <HI>acrid.</HI> Among the <HI>Cucumis,</HI> the Colocynth is by far the &s;tronge&s;t.</NOTE>, and no order is without exceptions, when even in varieties<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Of this the Bitter and Sweet Almond is an example; one of which is an innocent, mild &s;ub&s;tance, and very nutritious; the other, to &s;ome animals, poi&s;onous.</NOTE> the virtues are different, and often in the <HI>&s;ame part</HI> of the plant; as in the aromatic rind, the bitter &s;eed, and acid juice of the &s;ame Orange, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Be&s;ides, in medicine we often u&s;e different parts of the plant of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Thus of <HI>Senna</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia,</HI> in the one we u&s;e the leaves, in the other the bark; parts which are found of different virtues. If the leaves of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia</HI> were employed, it is probable the general rule would apply<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Potatoe, which belongs to the <HI>Genus Solanum,</HI> is another in&s;tance of this kind; and perhaps the &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be extended to it.</NOTE>. Our preparation al&s;o of a plant will alter its virtues, by correcting, de&s;troying, or ab|&s;tracting its acrid parts, an example of which you had formerly in the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ada.</HI></P>
<P>In my Catalogue I have &s;et down my Plants according to the na|tural order. In how much they contradict the general rule, &s;hall be mentioned when I come to treat of them particularly.</P>
<P>There is nothing, about which Phy&s;icians have been more anxious, than in finding the be&s;t method of inve&s;tigating the virtues of un|experienced

&s;ub&s;tances. Various have been the methods for this purpo&s;e; many more than the&s;e I have mentioned. All the me|thods I chu&s;e to employ, are expre&s;&s;ed in the aphori&s;m of Linnaeus, which I have already &s;et down. I have now explained the fir&s;t means of inve&s;tigation, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Sy&s;temate.</HI> I &s;hould next proceed to the &s;econd means, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Qualitate;</HI> but previous to that, I &s;hall take no|tice of &s;everal other aphori&s;ms of Linnaeus; and fir&s;t of that con|cerning the &s;oil, or, as he calls it, the <HI>locus</HI> of Plants. It is this: <HI>Locus ficcus &s;apidas, &s;ucculentus in&s;ipidas magis, aquo&s;us corro&s;ivas reddit.</HI></P>
<P>This rule, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, may be admitted like other general rules, but, like them, has al&s;o a great many exceptions. Thus Rice and Rye, both of them bland nutritious &s;ub&s;tances, are exceptions to this rule. Rice mu&s;t grow in &s;ome mea&s;ure in water; while the Rye delights in a dry &s;oil. The <HI>Becabunga</HI> is a very mild plant, the <HI>Hyo&s;cyamus</HI> one of the mo&s;t acrid, and yet the former grows in watery, the latter in dry &s;ituations. Even plants of the &s;ame ge|nus, will, in the &s;ame &s;oil, be very different; <HI>e. g.</HI> the <HI>Per&s;icaria mitis &amp; urens.</HI> Upon the whole, this rule &s;eems to have been taken from a few ob&s;ervations, and tho&s;e chiefly on the order of the <HI>umbellati.</HI> I imagine the two fir&s;t <HI>loci</HI> mentioned, the <HI>&s;iccus</HI> and <HI>&s;ucculentus,</HI> will apply be&s;t to the &s;ame plant, growing in diffe|rent &s;oils. Thus an Aromatic in a dry &s;oil is in the greate&s;t per|fection, while, tran&s;planted to a rich moi&s;t one, it lo&s;es its fra|grancy, and becomes in&s;ipid. This does not apply &s;o well to other &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Another aphori&s;m of Linnaeus is &s;till more general: <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Lacte&s;centes plantae communiter venenatae &s;unt.</HI> For my part, I have met with no exception to this rule, and even tho&s;e which have the milky con&s;i&s;tence, though without the colour, generally agree with it. Linnaeus him&s;elf gives &s;ome exception: <HI>e. g.</HI> the <HI>Semiflo&s;culo&s;ae,</HI> an order of plants, which we had occa&s;ion to mention as u&s;ed in aliment. All the&s;e give milky juices, but are,
<PB N="161" REF="014000_0167_0F928672794BA9E0">
however, no certain exceptions; for &s;everal of the cla&s;s are of deleterious qualities; and if tho&s;e we employed as food, were allowed to attain their full perfection, they would probably be found of the &s;ame kind. It is on this account that we blanch them, or u&s;e them only when young. Linnaeus, in a note, gives another exception, the <HI>Campanulatae</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of the&s;e enter into our food.</NOTE>, which in general are milder than the former; but as &s;ome of them are of dan|gerous qualities, the general rule ought &s;till to make us cautious concerning them, and all other lacte&s;cent plants, which are un|known to us.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the inve&s;tigation of the virtues of plants, <HI>ex Qualitate, i. e.</HI> according to the ta&s;te, &s;mell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Linnaeus, 1. Aphori&s;m&punc; here is, <HI>In&s;ipidae et inodorae vim medicam vix exercent.</HI> This rule &s;eems to be without any exception; and it is on this ac|count, and not on any proper experience, that many plants are ex|punged from the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> as having no ta&s;te or odour, which &s;hould point out in them any active qualities; and mo&s;t &s;uch, I believe, are employed as aliment. His other general rule, <HI>Sapidi&s;&s;imae et odorati&s;&s;imae maximam vim po&s;ident,</HI> I cannot admit &s;o indi&s;criminately; for the odour of Plants often re&s;ides in a portion incon&s;iderably &s;mall, who&s;e effects mu&s;t be very incon&s;iderable; neither mu&s;t we take the medical virtues merely from the poignancy of ta&s;te, as that often is deceitful. Thus Ipecacuana, a medicine of active powers, has no &s;mell; as to ta&s;te, it is very often latent, and not found till long chewed. On the contrary, the Cre&s;s kind, though of con&s;iderable poignancy of ta&s;te, are endued with very little medi|cal powers, at lea&s;t not with a <HI>vis maxima.</HI> However, as the want of odour, or ta&s;te, rejects the &s;uppo&s;ition of medical virtue, we may, on the whole, conclude, that tho&s;e which po&s;&s;e&s;s them, have more or le&s;s of &s;uch; the difficulty is to a&s;certain the degree.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="014000_0168_0F928673764DE6B8">
With regard to odours, I find this very difficult, as they are of &s;uch infinite variety, and of &s;o little re&s;emblance, as makes it very difficult to reduce them to any general heads, &s;o that thence we might derive particular virtues from the different kinds of them. Linnaeus has attempted a di&s;tinction of this &s;ort. The &s;imply fra|grant, as the Violet and Wall flower, &amp;c. the <HI>ambro&s;iaca,</HI> as the <HI>a&s;perula.</HI> By <HI>ambro&s;iacae</HI> he means &s;omewhat of a mu&s;k odour, and gives us another example, the <HI>malva mo&s;chata;</HI> which, by the bye, I take to be an evidence of very &s;trong odour, being accom|panied with little medical virtue; for this plant is of very inert qualities. Another odour he mentions, is the aromatic, compre|hending under it Thyme, Lavender, Saffron, Cinnamon, Sa&s;&s;afras, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all the&s;e are of a di&s;tinct odour, and any re&s;emblance they have, is found not to be &s;upported by their virtues in medicine, which are found by experience to be very different. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a kind &s;omewhat betwixt the fragrant and foetid, which I would call the <HI>graveolenta,</HI> &s;uch as that of Cummin, Co|riander, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The more directly foetid are as much to be di&s;|tingui&s;hed from each other as the aromatic, <HI>i. e.</HI> the difference of the Rue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is very different from the &s;tupifying odour of To|bacco or Opium, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, very little of the medicinal powers are to be de|termined from the odour. Some degree of it, indeed, may be de|termined from a very &s;trong one, though even that is often falla|cious.</P>
<P>Linnaeus's other general rule, <HI>Sapidae et &s;uaveolentes bonae &s;unt; nau&s;eo&s;ae et graveolentes venenatae &s;unt,</HI> will be found often to be fal&s;e; nay, in many ca&s;es, the rever&s;e. Thus, almo&s;t all the Lily kind, which are certainly <HI>&s;uaveolentae,</HI> are poi&s;onous, as al&s;o the Ja&s;mine; and on the other hand, the nau&s;eous and foetid are often without any dangerous powers, while tho&s;e altogether inodorous often po&s;&s;e&s;s them. Linnaeus al&s;o pretends to &s;ay, that <HI>&s;apida non agunt in nervos, nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> olida in fibras mu&s;culares, &amp;c.</HI> This depends
<PB N="163" REF="014000_0169_0F9286742EF773E8">
on a nice, phy&s;iological di&s;tinction, and if, as I think, the moving fibres are continuations of the nerves, or at lea&s;t intimately affected by them, what acts upon the one, will certainly do &s;o on the other.</P>
<P>Linnaeus's next aphori&s;m, <HI>Ambro&s;iaca analeptica, Fragrantia or|ga&s;tica, Aromatica excitantia, Tetra &s;tupefacientia. Nau&s;eo&s;a corro&s;iva,</HI> is very difficult to under&s;tand, and, were it nece&s;&s;ary to comment upon it, might ea&s;ily be &s;hown to have little foundation in nature.</P>
<P>So much with regard to Smell. Ta&s;te is of con&s;iderable more u&s;e than Smell in determining the virtues <HI>a priori.</HI> Authors on this &s;ubject have generally &s;topt at generalities. Linnaeus is very imper|fect upon it. Our countryman, Abercrombie, has al&s;o touched on the &s;ame &s;ubject; but from Sir John Floyer's Treati&s;e, though at fir&s;t attempted with imperfection. I find I am able to draw the mo&s;t u&s;eful hints. Having then &s;poken on the Subject of Sy&s;tem and Quality &s;o far as regards Odour (of which having &s;aid enough) I go on to</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="characteristic">
<HEAD>TASTE.</HEAD>
<P>Ta&s;te labours under the &s;ame difficulties as Odour. The per|ceptions from the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion vary in Smell remarkably, in Ta&s;te con&s;iderably &s;o. There is not only the &s;ame difference of what is grateful to one being not &s;o to another, but al&s;o a dif|ference with regard to impre&s;&s;ion, what is acrid to me being al|mo&s;t in&s;ipid to another. It is not with regard to &s;weet and bitter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that men differ, it is with regard to compound ta&s;tes, in expre&s;|&s;ing which there is no &s;mall difficulty; but as this &s;ubject leads farther than any other to the knowledge of unexperienced &s;ub|&s;tances, I &s;hall attempt, as a foundation for ob&s;ervations after|wards to be made upon it, to give &s;omewhat of an arrangement of Ta&s;tes.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="164" REF="014000_0170_0F92867624D6D4F8">
1. <HI>In&s;ipid.</HI> This is of three kinds: The watery, mucilaginous, and oily; in all of which we judge properly of the con&s;i&s;tence, and not of the impre&s;&s;ion or Ta&s;te. Of the Ta&s;tes that produce &s;api|dity, I &s;hall fir&s;t take notice of one in common to the whole vege|table kingdom, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the 2d, the <HI>Herbaceous.</HI> In many plants we have this perception, joined with many others, &s;o that, however, the herbaceous lurks under the whole, and in common to the whole plant.</P>
<P>Sometimes again it is <HI>&s;imple,</HI> as in Chickweed. The herbaceous is frequently mixed with more or le&s;s of the oily, poignant, &s;aline, called a nitrous ta&s;te, as in raw Beets, and Spinage. Another diffe|rence of it belongs to the <HI>Legumina,</HI> called the Pea Ta&s;te, found in the leaves of Pea&s;e and other <HI>Legumina.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Acid.</HI> This is &s;imple and pure, in &s;ome fruits of a watery con|&s;i&s;tence, as Oranges &s;eparated from the rind.</P>
<P N="4">4. Next to this is the Au&s;tere, or Styptic Ta&s;te, as that in galls, or the barks of trees: In which la&s;t it is as fundamental as the herbace|ous Ta&s;te in vegetables. <HI>Acerb</HI> is often confounded with acid or au&s;tere, but it is properly a compound of both. All fruits in their unripe &s;tate are acerb, &s;ome of them always remain &s;o, as Sloes. Between the acid and acerb, there are intermediate degrees. Lemons have a degree, <HI>e. g.</HI> of au&s;terity along with their acid.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Sweet,</HI> e. g. <HI>Sugar.</HI> This is &s;eldom pure, and commonly united and confounded with acid, as in the <HI>acido dulces:</HI> And that again has commonly &s;omewhat of acerbity along with it. Sweet is al&s;o united with au&s;tere, producing what Floyer calls the Fern Ta&s;te. This is obvious in polypody, ferns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The next &s;imple Ta&s;te is <HI>the Bitter.</HI> This is &s;eldom pure, often confounded with acrimony, aromatic, or au&s;tere. To me an in&s;tance of the pure Bitter occurs in Gentian.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="165" REF="014000_0171_0F92867659003138">
7. The <HI>pure Acrid</HI> is difficult to find. An example occurs in Guinea Pepper. When an acrimony is joined to fragrancy of odour it is aromatic. This is more or le&s;s pure. Cinnamon is an in&s;tance of the pure&s;t aromatic. When an acrid is joined with a di&s;agreeable odour, it may be called foetid or nau&s;eous. Some, however, take the nau&s;eous as a &s;imple ta&s;te, an in&s;tance of which is given in Opium, which is neither bitter nor acrid.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the &s;imple Ta&s;tes. Various are the Ta&s;tes com|pounded of the&s;e; the au&s;tere bitter of Rhubarb; the aromatic bitter, as in Orange or Lemon peel; the nau&s;eous bitter, as in <HI>A&s;&s;a Foetida;</HI> the peculiar bitter of Floyer, which he calls the &s;moaky or &s;ooty bitter, and Naturali&s;ts the <HI>amaro frigida,</HI> as Lettuce, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Laurel bitter, which is commonly enclo&s;ed in &s;hells, as bitter Almonds, kernels of black Cherries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the bal&s;amic or terebinthinate bitter, as that of Turpentine, Re&s;ins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are exam|ples of compound bitters, and probably the foundation of all their varieties.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of compound Acrids occur in the bitter Acrid, as <HI>Cur|cuma,</HI> the nau&s;eous Acrid, which is commonly purgative, as Seneka, in chewing of which you have a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Ta&s;tes, in&s;ipid, &s;weet, nau&s;eous, acrid, which commonly, as I &s;aid ju&s;t now, &s;erves to di&s;tingui&s;h purgatives.</P>
<P>Compound aromatic Ta&s;tes occur in Ginger. Cinnamon, I have &s;aid, is purely and &s;imply aromatic; in Ginger the acrimony is more evident with le&s;s of the <HI>aroma.</HI> It is thus we di&s;tingui&s;h between the acrid aromatic and the aromatic acrid.</P>
<P>The Cre&s;s and Garlic Acrids occur in Cre&s;&s;es, Garlic, Onions, and others of the Cla&s;s.</P>
<P>This li&s;t of Ta&s;tes is very far from being compleat. However, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to give it, in order for a foundation for more accurate di&s;tinctions, as they are the leading experiments of judging
<PB N="166" REF="014000_0172_0F928676EBA96228">
by analogy. On the whole, the virtues of &s;ub&s;tances accompany pretty con&s;tantly and regularly their peculiar Ta&s;tes, e&s;pecially if they are &s;imple. In compound Ta&s;tes we ought always to he&s;itate, for the virtues of a medicine are often found to re&s;ide principally in a very &s;mall proportion of &s;apid &s;ub&s;tance, which, amid&s;t the confu&s;ion of other Ta&s;tes, will often di&s;cover it&s;elf imperfectly and ob&s;curely, if it is not hid altogether. As to the &s;imple Ta&s;tes, the pure au&s;tere is a&s;tringent, the &s;weet nutritious, and the pure bitter of the &s;ame virtues with the re&s;t of the kind; but more of this &s;hall be ob&s;erved afterwards, when I come to treat of particular &s;ub&s;tances, which in my Catalogue I have &s;ometimes arranged, according to their unifor|mity of Ta&s;tes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="characteristic">
<HEAD>COLOUR.</HEAD>
<P>Linnaeus has taken in Colour, as varying the virtues of Medicines. His aphori&s;m is this, <HI>Color pallidus in&s;ipidum, viridis crudum, luteus amarum, ruber acidum, albus dulce, niger ingratum indicat.</HI> All the&s;e of Colour is le&s;s u&s;eful than the Odour, much le&s;s &s;o than the Ta&s;te, and is very far from being general.</P>
<P><HI>Luteus amarum indicat.</HI> I formerly ob&s;erved, the lacte&s;cent plants, and even &s;uch as were of milky con&s;i&s;tence, were often poi&s;onous, and had a degree of acrimony and bitterne&s;s with them. If Linnaeus, then, had &s;aid, that the yellow juices of plants were bitter, or acrid, his rule would have been much more general. The yellow Plumb is an exception.</P>
<P><HI>Rub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r acidum.</HI> This is not founded. It is applicable only to fruits, which, in proportion to their redne&s;s, have often their acerbity turned to an acid; for many flowers are red, which have no acidity. Several plants which are of a green colour are acid, as Sorrel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but the&s;e Linnaeus &s;ays are only &s;uch as turn red in autumn. But &s;urely the <HI>Bra&s;&s;ica,</HI> which is of this kind, has in it no acidity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="014000_0173_0F92867844831B08">
<HI>Viridis crudum.</HI> This ob&s;ervation is only relative, being applica|ble only to fruits, which, in the progre&s;s of their growth, change their colour with their maturity.</P>
<P><HI>Pallidus in&s;ipidum.</HI> This is a &s;till greater mi&s;take, for pale plants are far from being generally in&s;ipid. Linnaeus means here tho&s;e plants which, being naturally green, attain, by blanching, a white colour.</P>
<P><HI>Albus dulce.</HI> This rule is relative to fruits. Thus the white cur|rant is &s;weeter than the red. Whether it applies to apples, plumbs, ra&s;ps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is a que&s;tion. Certain it is, that the red plumb is as &s;weet as the white, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This rule, as well as the re&s;t, is of very little u&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Niger ingratum.</HI> This is far from being conclu&s;ive, although when a general rule of this kind leads to an important caution, it ought to be ob&s;erved. Black currants, in contradiction to it, are equally harmle&s;s with the red.</P>
<P>This fini&s;hes what I had to &s;ay on the &s;en&s;ible qualities. Another method of examining and detecting the virtues of plants is by their chemical qualities.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="qualities">
<HEAD>CHEMICAL QUALITIES.</HEAD>
<P>From chemical inve&s;tigation much has been expected; but it is now known little can be obtained. The fir&s;t means of applying Chemi&s;try to this purpo&s;e, is by the di&s;tillation <HI>per &s;e.</HI> It is now known, that the matters hence produced, are the &s;ame in all plants; their proportion only being different in different &s;ub&s;tances. It &s;erves, however, to di&s;tingui&s;h between animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances; the fir&s;t giving a volatile alkali, the &s;econd an acid, in the fir&s;t part of their di&s;tillation. The <HI>fungi,</HI> however, and e&s;culent mu&s;hrooms, according to Geoffroy, give out a volatile alkali in the fir&s;t part of the di&s;tillation. If any other &s;uch be found, we may conclude
<PB N="168" REF="014000_0174_0F92862BF865F530">
them among the more putre&s;cent vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, and of pe|culiar qualities. Chemical analy&s;is may be employed in &s;uch a ca&s;e as the following, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> of an expre&s;&s;ed juice pre&s;ented to us, which has come from abroad. If &s;uch give out a volatile alkali in di&s;til|lation, we may conclude, that the &s;ub&s;tance was very nearly animal, or, indeed, what is more probable, that it had undergone the putre|factive proce&s;s in tran&s;portation. With regard to the acid of vegeta|ble, I do not know whether it will bear any application; for not only is it varied in different vegetables, but al&s;o is not regular, that is, in any determinate proportion to the virues of the recent plant, that which in its fre&s;h &s;tate has lea&s;t of it, affording &s;ometimes mo&s;t in di&s;tillation. The quantity of volatile alkali is al&s;o much diver&s;ified, but from the&s;e I am of opinion we might determine the different alkale&s;cency of animal food.</P>
<P>If time were allowed me, it is very po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould go through a great number of di&s;tillations, in order to determine what influence the difference of proportion might have. The experiments of the French Academy are not properly compared on this &s;ubject, of the proportion of different principles by chemical analy&s;is. 1. With regard to &s;pt. rector. &s;ome have given it without decompo&s;ition, and allowed it to pa&s;s over unnoticed into the receiver, or allowed to mix indi&s;criminately with the other parts. 2. Acid is gro&s;ly e&s;timated from the proportion of water; whereas in all ca&s;es it ought to have been determined from a further rectification. 3. Alkali is &s;till more imperfectly computed, being never e&s;timated but in &s;o far as it appeared in a &s;olid form; whereas &s;ome of it is always in the phlegm, and &s;ome of it united with the acid into an ammoniacal &s;alt. Neither, 4. with regard to the oil is the e&s;timate fair. They have always neglected that which is in the charcoal, who&s;e black|ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is often owing to this, and, in my opinion, the diminu|tion it &s;uffers of weight in the open air, may always be reckoned as &s;o much oil of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="014000_0175_0F92867873F4A8C0">
Upon the whole, although this &s;ubject had been properly execut|ed, it is uncertain what inferences might have been drawn from it; but, as the matter is at pre&s;ent, in talking of medicines I &s;hall always neglect it.</P>
<P>Another le&s;s violent Chemi&s;try has been propo&s;ed by Lemery, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Fermentation; but that, in my opinion, would as much alter our &s;ubjects as Fire.</P>
<P>Another method of inve&s;tigation has been propo&s;ed from the E&s;&s;ential Salts; but this has been &s;o little followed, that I do not know what can be drawn from it; and indeed they generally ari&s;e from a decompo&s;ition: However, if they be in very great proportion, &s;ome judgment may be formed, as, <HI>e. g.</HI> a large proportion of Sugar may be inferred nutritious.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Solution and Extraction by different <HI>Men&s;trua</HI> has been propo&s;ed, but I am afraid on as weak foundations, for di&s;covering the virtues of remedies, as any of the former. The <HI>Men&s;trua</HI> u&s;ed are commonly Water and Alcohol. The re&s;inous parts extracted by the Alcohol are ordinarily mo&s;t active, although this is far from being general, as the gummy often are &s;o. But this, as leading to, and being the foundation of, the pharmaceutical treatment, I &s;hall always in&s;ert from the be&s;t Authors, and give ob&s;ervations in con&s;e|quence.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="class of medicine">
<HEAD>ADSTRINGENTIA.</HEAD>
<P>The di&s;tribution of particular &s;ub&s;tances I have formerly explained: The different Medicines were di&s;tributed according to the indicati|ons, and, if the&s;e were one and the &s;ame, according to their common operation on the human body. The order of the &s;everal indications was this: 1. According to their operation on the Solids and Fluids. The operation on the &s;olids is divided into two kinds; fir&s;t, as they act on the &s;imple &s;olid; &s;econdly, as on the <HI>&s;olida viva,</HI> or the organs of animals, who&s;e properties di&s;appear with life.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="014000_0176_0F92867938759D00">
With regard to the&s;e generalities, I need not hint that it is im|po&s;&s;ible ab&s;olutely to be correct, for there is no di&s;tribution which is not liable to very great difficulty: We have, however, given that which to us &s;eemed the be&s;t, for in the beginning of &s;tudy we ought to acquire general propo&s;itions, afterwards finding out excep|tions, or applying them to particular ca&s;es. We now begin with tho&s;e Medicines which act on the &s;imple Solids: The&s;e are of two kinds; fir&s;t, as they increa&s;e; &s;econdly, &s;uch as dimini&s;h the cohe|&s;ion and &s;trength of the &s;imple Solid. Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t kind are what are &s;trictly A&s;tringents, called al&s;o Con&s;tringents, Styptics, Tonies, Roborants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as we have formerly mentioned: This is the &s;imple&s;t view of them, and what we mu&s;t here nece&s;&s;arily take. With regard to this, as well as all other heads, we &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew their manner of action on the human body, the di&s;ea&s;es in which they are required, the particulars wherein they are hurt|ful, in what manner their virtues are di&s;covered to be pre&s;ent, and along with that the particular part or parts in which their virtue re|&s;ides, which leads us, la&s;tly, to the Pharmaceutical Rules for their Extraction.</P>
<P>As to the Operation of ASTRINGENTS, &s;ome people have ima|gined to them&s;elves a very &s;imple theory. Animal Fibres they &s;uppo&s;ed or con&s;idered as compo&s;ed of &s;olid earthy particles, ad|hering together in a line, by means of a gluten compo&s;ed of water and oil; <HI>vide Boerhaave.</HI> Now, with regard to increa&s;ing the Cohe&s;ion of the Fibres, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to depend on the prox|imity of the particles. If then we in&s;inuate between each particle another of the &s;ame kind, we encrea&s;e the Cohe&s;ion of the Fibre, and in this manner have A&s;tringents been &s;uppo&s;ed to act. This theory is very uncertain, and there is no in&s;tance in other parts of Nature, of increa&s;ing the Cohe&s;ion of Bodies in this manner: Even in the Coagulation of Fluids, which is analogous to this, we cannot cer|tainly &s;ay it is performed by the interpo&s;ition or in&s;ertion of particles of another of the &s;ame kind. Some appearances, however, &s;eem to contradict this: Thus the coagulation of White of Eggs by Spirit
<PB N="171" REF="014000_0177_0F92867A095DBC50">
of Wine may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be by the in&s;inuation of the particles of the Spirit of Wine between tho&s;e of the Albumen, and &s;o attracting them to each other. To me it &s;eems rather owing to a decompo|&s;ition, the Spirit of Wine attracting the Water, and &s;o the &s;olid parts running together. Coagulation &s;eems to be a-decompo&s;ition, or a detraction of &s;ome parts, in the &s;ame manner as a fluid volatile <HI>alkali</HI> forms with Spirit of Wine an <HI>Offa Helmontii,</HI> by attracting the water of the volatile <HI>alkali.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;imple fibre, then, being compo&s;ed of fluid and &s;olid, the co|he&s;ion of the whole may be encrea&s;ed, by dimini&s;hing the watery &s;ub&s;tance, or by addition of &s;olid. It appears to me, that A&s;trin|gents act more in the fir&s;t way, by ex&s;iccating or ab&s;orbing the fluids interpo&s;ed. Thus the operation of tanning, which is entirely analogous to this, is carried on almo&s;t entirely by ab&s;traction of fluids. So much for the action of A&s;tringents on the &s;imple &s;olid fibres. I mu&s;t now ob&s;erve, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep to our fir&s;t re&s;olution of &s;eparating bodies, which act on the &s;imple &s;olids, from tho&s;e which act on the moving fibres. A&s;tringents, then, mu&s;t have a double action, fir&s;t, on the &s;imple &s;olid; &s;econdly, on the <HI>&s;olida viva,</HI> or the fibres of living bodies. If the action was only on the &s;imple fibres, it mu&s;t be confined to the part, to which the &s;ub&s;tance was directly applied, by ab&s;orbing its fluid, or increa&s;ing its &s;olid parts; whereas we &s;ee the effect propagated to the re&s;t of the body. Thus, Alum applied to the tip of the tongue, does not &s;top in its action there, but, independent of diffu&s;ion, induces cohe&s;ion and corrugation over the whole mouth. If then A&s;tringents taken into the &s;tomach extend, in a &s;hort time, their action over the &s;y&s;tem, I maintain it is owing to their ef|fect on the moving fibres. If then we look to an A&s;tringent's action on a particular part, and then its operation over the whole &s;y&s;tem, it is inconceivable, and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to alledge, that the do&s;e can be &s;o divided, as to be conveyed to every particular part, or, far le&s;s, to the morbid part. We mu&s;t, therefore, &s;up|po&s;e &s;ome other rea&s;on, and the effect on the &s;y&s;tem is in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="172" REF="014000_0178_0F92867AB35E3908">
of the univer&s;al &s;ympathy of the &s;tomach; as when we give an A&s;tringent internally in an Haemorrhagy of the <HI>Uterus,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible that a &s;mall portion of an A&s;tringent can be &s;o divided as to be carried there, far le&s;s that the whole of it &s;hould be &s;o, to pro|duce this effect. The propagation of virtues, then, as all other effects on the nervous power is &s;carcely explicable, but as innumerable in|&s;tances of it occur, we mu&s;t admit it as a fact.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have only con&s;idered A&s;tringents as acting on a particular part, but they al&s;o may be con&s;idered in different lights, <HI>e. g.</HI> certain Stimulants may be a&s;tringent. The&s;e encrea&s;e the con|traction of the moving fibres, and are either tonic or clonic, pro|ducing a &s;imple contraction which remains, or alternate o&s;cillatory motions. If &s;uch then as produce only that &s;imple contraction exi&s;t, they mu&s;t be a&s;tringents. Of this I &s;hall afterwards &s;peak under the head of &s;timulants. There is another view in which A&s;tringents have been taken, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that of &s;topping encrea&s;ed eva|cuations. Whatever dimini&s;hes the&s;e, mu&s;t be a&s;tringents; and it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate the &s;topping of Evacuations, from the operation of a&s;tringents in this view.</P>
<P>This introduces &s;ome confu&s;ion, as the means of &s;topping Eva|cuations are various; 1. Encrea&s;ing the contraction of the lax &s;imple fibre; 2. Of the moving fibres; 3. By le&s;&s;ening the impetus of the blood on a particular part. Here, then, Sedatives are A&s;|tringents, and A&s;tringents Sedatives. Sedatives operate either by dimini&s;hing the influx of the nervous power, or its mobility, and &s;o are what is called refrigerant. In this view farther, then, as Evacua|tions depend often on too great influx of the nervous power, and that often on mobility induced by acrimony, Demulcents may be a&s;trin|gent, as &s;heathing the acrimony. There may be farther means of &s;topping encrea&s;ed Evacuations that may be referred to this head. All Ob&s;tructions may depend on two cau&s;es; either a Contraction of the Solids, or a Coagulation of the Fluids. If any medicines be introduced into the body, which coagulate the fluids, they are certainly A&s;tringents.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="diseases">
<HEAD>The DISEASES in which ASTRINGENTS are indicated.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e naturally follow from what we have been &s;aying; 1. They are indicated in laxity of the &s;imple &s;olid. This is the object of their operation, which has been mo&s;t commonly con&s;idered. Howe|ver, I have a doubt whether this laxity &s;o often takes place as is imagined; for the &s;tate of the &s;imple &s;olids &s;eems permanent and fixed, or varied &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly and &s;lowly by the age of the animal, that for the cour&s;e of a year, far le&s;s that of months, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we can conceive very little change of laxity or rigidity of the &s;imple fibres produced, or, indeed, remedied, in the &s;ame time. Wherever we &s;ee weakne&s;s, we deduce it from laxity of the &s;imple fibres, but this never occurs, except in very few in&s;tances. The&s;e, I think, are &s;carcely more than the following, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> application of Emollients in over proportion to a particular part, an overflow of moi&s;ture, as the di&s;&s;olution of even the bones by the Rickets, or an over&s;tretching, de&s;troying the tone of the part. The&s;e, however, are but rare ca&s;es, and &s;uch laxity of the &s;imple &s;olids as is commonly imagined, I can neither &s;uppo&s;e or believe; &s;o that this indication from the laxity of the &s;imple &s;olids, very &s;eldom takes place. I think A&s;tringents &s;el|dom act by re&s;toring this cohe&s;ion: I admit, indeed, that they do externally in topical application; but with regard to internal action, I cannot conceive them capable of being applied to the ultimate fibres in the common cour&s;e of circulation. Nor, indeed, can I ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e this di&s;tribution through the &s;ides of a &s;mall artery, who&s;e &s;ides again are &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of the&s;e, di&s;po&s;ed along its &s;ides, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To me, the Nerves &s;eem the ultimate fibres of the human body, through which a fluid is di&s;tributed by filtration along their &s;ub&s;tance, in the &s;ame manner as in vegetables; &s;o that in this view a very &s;mall proportion of A&s;tringent may produce a very great effect.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="174" REF="014000_0180_0F92867C328A04D0">
2. A&s;tringents are indicated in debility of moving fibres. This manife&s;tly often takes place, and may be induced in a month, or a moment, for the motion of the nervous fluids may be arre&s;ted by the lea&s;t affection. The&s;e are the ca&s;es where mo&s;t univer&s;ally A&s;trin|gents are nece&s;&s;ary, and in which they mo&s;t commonly act.</P>
<P N="3">3. A&s;tringents are indicated in encrea&s;ed action of the &s;olids. I explained before how an encrea&s;ed action of the &s;olids may depend on irritability, and not on encrea&s;ed &s;trength. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, where encrea&s;ed action depends on the irritability or mobility of the part, A&s;tringents act by dimini&s;hing the impetus of the nervous fluid, and &s;o taking off the encrea&s;ed irritability and encrea&s;ed action. As &s;pa&s;modic affections often ari&s;e from encrea&s;ed mobility or irritability, A&s;tringents, as taking off the&s;e, have been reckoned Anti&s;pa&s;modics.</P>
<P N="4">4. A&s;tringents are more univer&s;ally indicated in encrea&s;ed evacua|tions depending on laxity of the &s;imple &s;olids, or mobility and irrita|bility of the moving fibres, in which la&s;t ca&s;e their action has been commonly confounded with their action on the &s;imple &s;olids.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another indication is, when A&s;tringents have been employed, as in the ca&s;e of wounds. There is no term more frequent than that of Vulneraries, which are commonly A&s;tringents. I &s;aid for|merly, that mo&s;t Vulneraries were built on an imaginary founda|tion; but con&s;idering the matter more nearly, I now &s;ee a ca&s;e, where they may be u&s;ed in &s;ome &s;uch view, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in tho&s;e ulcers which are con&s;equent upon wounds. It is but a late di&s;covery that internal medicines promote the formation of <HI>pus</HI> in ulcers; for this purpo&s;e the Peruvian Bark has been effectually employed, which I con&s;tantly con&s;ider as more or le&s;s of an A&s;tringent; for in other ca&s;es where Peruvian Bark is u&s;ed, as in &s;evers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> other A&s;tringents have been &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;ub&s;tituted, &s;o that I imagine in them &s;omewhat of a common virtue, and hence we may &s;uppo&s;e, that our A&s;tringents, as well as the Bark, may be favourers of &s;up|puration
<PB N="175" REF="014000_0181_0F92867CED7A5968">
in wounds, and that we may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;tore the term of Vulnerary.</P>

<HEAD>DISEASES, or CASES, where they are contraindicated.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. They may be hurtful by inducing too great a degree of con|&s;triction in the &s;y&s;tem, and thus have I known a &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s brought on by their u&s;e, which mu&s;t either depend on an over quan|tity of fluids in proportion to the &s;olids, or on a con&s;triction of the &s;olids.</P>
<P N="2">2. Exce&s;s in the u&s;e of A&s;tringents may de&s;troy the mobility of the moving fibres, and it is from this effect that they have perhaps been ju&s;tly accu&s;ed of a deleterious poi&s;onous quality, bringing on pal&s;ies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and weakne&s;s and flaccidity may as well appear from taking off the mobility too much, as by any other means. The&s;e effects appear in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the natural and nece&s;&s;ary excre|tions; &s;o that in the u&s;e of A&s;tringents, we &s;hould never proceed &s;o far, as to hazard the &s;toppage of the&s;e. I formerly mentioned one principal u&s;e of A&s;tringents to be in &s;topping encrea&s;ed evacuations. Here, by the u&s;e of A&s;tringents, if we proceed carele&s;sly, we are apt to run into extremes; and there is nothing more difficult in the practice of phy&s;ic, than to judge the degree in which A&s;tringents are to be given, without injuring the healthy evacuations, as well as the kinds which are proper. <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers are very imperfect upon this head, and commonly under each A&s;tringent, they tell us it is anti-dy&s;enteric, and a medicine for the <HI>diarrhoea,</HI> &amp;c. but they always ought to have added the&s;e two cautions; 1. That A&s;tringents never ought to be employed where the morbid &s;timulus or acrimony, which produces or continues the di&s;ea&s;e, has not been previou&s;ly evacuated; for then occa&s;ion is given it to ferment, to multiply it&s;elf and a&s;&s;imilate other fluids to its nature, which will cau&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e to return with accumulated violence; or, if the A&s;tringents have been &s;o &s;trong as to prevent this effect, it will cau&s;e the acrimony to fall on other parts of the &s;y&s;tem; perhaps with more dangerous con&s;equences. This general rule requires &s;ome
<PB N="176" REF="014000_0182_0F92867FE6CC9630">
nicety in the application. Too great an attention to the acrimony is not always nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Another view of this matter is, that the&s;e encrea&s;ed evacuations often depend on a determination of the fluids to particular parts, as in a plethoric habit to the no&s;e, uterus, or lungs, which may be e&s;tabli&s;hed by laws of the &s;y&s;tem, or by habits which are equal to the&s;e laws. If then we u&s;e A&s;tringents here, we may perhaps lo&s;e our labour, or, which is of more importance, by &s;uddenly &s;topping the flow of fluids to the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o &s;uddenly changing the balance, a determination is made to places of more con&s;equence, where di&s;ea&s;e is of more danger.</P>
<P>Evacuations often take place al&s;o, in con&s;equence of a con&s;triction of the &s;urface, determining a greater flow to the inte&s;tines. There is no method of remedying this, but by giving way, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, to the evacuations, or cau&s;ing the determination &s;ome other way, and till this be obtained, A&s;tringents ought never to be u&s;ed. If their determination have not continued &s;o long as to e&s;tabli&s;h a law, then we &s;hould endeavour to return it by the &s;kin, its proper emunctory.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the chief cautions in the u&s;e of A&s;tringents. There are &s;till two others. One ari&s;es from this ob&s;ervation, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that al|though I have &s;aid that A&s;tringents, when taken into the mouth, extend their action over the whole &s;y&s;tem, yet that their effects mu&s;t be greater in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> to which they are immediately applied; &s;o that in the exhibition of A&s;tringents, we mu&s;t take care not to &s;uppre&s;s the natural evacuations, while we only endeavour to check the morbid. Another caution is, that in all the&s;e ca&s;es, where the&s;e A&s;tringents are to be employed as Roborants, they ought to be thrown in only in &s;mall do&s;es, and at proper intervals; for in this indication we only intend to give &s;uch an a&s;triction, as by en|crea&s;ing the &s;trength of the ve&s;&s;els, they may be enabled to propel their fluids properly. Thus when we u&s;e Steel as an A&s;tringent,
<PB N="177" REF="014000_0183_0F9286801BE9B0E0">
we mu&s;t ob&s;erve this caution; for if we give it in large quantities, &s;uch a &s;udden con&s;triction may be induced as entirely to counteract our intention. We now go to the</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="methods">
<HEAD>MEANS of di&s;covering the VIRTUES of ASTRINGENTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. One method of knowing A&s;tringents is by their experienced effects in arts, particularly in the art of tanning leather. Several Societies have been employed in finding a variety of &s;ub&s;tances, which may be employed in this way; and have accordingly produced a large li&s;t of vegetables employed, or which <HI>may</HI> be &s;o, in this way, be&s;ides the oak bark. We may allow that all the plants which are found in tho&s;e li&s;ts, may be concluded A&s;tringents, and in propor|tion to the effect they had in the tanning proce&s;s, may we infer their a&s;tringent virtue in animal bodies. Here, however, a caution is nece&s;&s;ary; for &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances, be&s;ides their A&s;tringency, may often be accompanied with other matters, which may render their u&s;e noxious. Perhaps it may be &s;aid that &s;everal of the &s;ub&s;tances, given by tho&s;e Gentlemen in their li&s;ts, were employed on a pre|vious knowledge of their A&s;tringency; but this does not contradict what we have &s;aid of &s;ub&s;tances which an&s;wered in tanning, being capable of being u&s;ed as A&s;tringents, if they po&s;&s;e&s;s no other noxious quality.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another method of di&s;covering A&s;tringents is by their decoctions, which, thrown into a &s;olution of green vitriol, &s;trike a black colour, and form an ink; and tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances which thus give the blacke&s;t ink, provided they are not accompanied with any peculiar acrimony, which di&s;charges their u&s;e as A&s;tringents, may be reckoned the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. A&s;tringents are di&s;coverable by an au&s;tere, or acerb ta&s;te. Some are endued with an odour, but this is a &s;eparate matter, ac|cidentally accompanying them, and adds nothing to their a&s;tringent virtue; for true and pure A&s;tringents have an acerb, au&s;tere ta&s;te,
<PB N="178" REF="014000_0184_0F928680EBA44590">
without odour; for when the odour is great, and joined with other &s;ub&s;tances, we mu&s;t reject their u&s;e as A&s;tringents.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="sources">
<HEAD>PARTS of VEGETABLES where ASTRINGENCY is lodged.</HEAD>
<P>I think the <HI>au&s;tere</HI> A&s;tringents are lodged univer&s;ally in the &s;olid parts of vegetables, mo&s;t commonly in the bark, frequently in the woods, and &s;ometimes in the roots, and indeed I imagine there is an A&s;tringency in the &s;olid parts of all vegetables, and that in mo&s;t it is only accompanied with other parts which prevent our per|ceiving it. The acerb A&s;tringents are found in the fluid parts of plants, and that commonly in the juices of unripe fruits, or perhaps in other unripe juices of plants. The Chemi&s;ts have gone further in a&s;certaining where the a&s;tringent part is lodged. They alledge, per|haps with &s;ome propriety, that it always re&s;ides in the earthy parts, which they have &s;uppo&s;ed, in order to form this A&s;tringency, to be joined with an acid. In the acerb A&s;tringents &s;ome acid is found, but in au&s;tere A&s;tringents none &s;uch has been found, even on che|mical trials, and the&s;e are indeed &s;ub&s;tances which them&s;elves attract acid. In what part the a&s;tringent virtue re&s;ides is uncertain. Here, however, I may ob&s;erve one fact, namely, that all A&s;tringents act more powerfully in &s;ub&s;tance than in decoction, or any other method of preparation; for our &s;tomach has powers of &s;olution, which out of the body we cannot imitate. Here &s;aline A&s;tringents are excepted, <HI>e. g.</HI> the vitriols, for it is indifferent in what form they are introduced. It is however, often nece&s;&s;ary for the more con-convenient exhibition, to extract our A&s;tringents, and employ them in a fluid form, which leads me to the pharmaceutical treatment.</P>

<HEAD>PHARMACEUTICAL TREATMENT of ASTRINGENTS.</HEAD>
<P>By Newman's and Cartheu&s;er's Experiments, it appears, that A&s;tringents are equally &s;oluble in water and alcohol. They &s;ay a &s;piritous men&s;truum is be&s;t, and that though water extracts more,
<PB N="179" REF="014000_0185_0F92868170187C18">

<HEAD>BOLES.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the term of <HI>Bole,</HI> the application of it has been various at different times. The Boles of the Ancients, <HI>e. g.</HI> the Boles of Galen, &s;eem to have been our ab&s;orbent Earths; whereas the Boles we employ, are not ab&s;orbents; for they are neither &s;oluble nor efferve&s;ce with acid in the cold. Their variety is very con&s;iderable, but we need only make one di&s;tinction of them, that tho&s;e of the greate&s;t purity are be&s;t, and only fit to be employed. They are frequently adulterated; for our Druggi&s;ts &s;eldom take the trouble of bringing Boles from A&s;ia; for we have Boles at home of the &s;ame quality and virtues, only wanting their colour, which we give them, by making a mixture of the pure&s;t white Clay and red Ochre, which, however it may be a fraud in trade, an&s;wers equally well in Medicine. We have been retrenching the Boles; for my part, I think we might altogether reject them. Their virtues are very incon&s;iderable. Applied to the tongue they give a certain rough ta&s;te, and appear a&s;tringent. But, in my opinion, it is only an ex&s;iccating quality, drinking up the moi&s;ture of the tongue, for when pure Bole is diffu&s;ed in water no &s;uch ta&s;te is ob&s;erved. With regard to Earthy Medicines, which are not &s;oluble in our fluids, little effect can be expected from them; and in order to render them fit for medicine they mu&s;t be previou&s;ly combined with acids, either by <HI>nature</HI> or <HI>art;</HI> or if intended to ex&s;iccate, they mu&s;t be given in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uch a mon&s;trous quantity as entirely to overload the &s;tomach.

Perhaps they are already combined with an acid, or if not may be di&s;&s;olved by that in our &s;tomach, becoming in this way medicated. Many al&s;o con|tain Alum, and on this account may be medicated &s;ub&s;tances; but in the&s;e ca&s;es it is only on account of the Vitriol and Alum they contain, and certainly it would be much better to u&s;e the&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances by them&s;elves, than in &s;uch an uncertain manner as they mu&s;t be in tho&s;e combinations.</P>

I forgot to mention, that Boles were hardly di&s;&s;oluble in acids, except when very concentrated or a&s;&s;i&s;ted with much heat, and the Earth of Alum is now known to be furni&s;hed, by every Bole and Clay, which may be extracted by every acid, even the weak vege|table, and &s;o likewi&s;e by the acid in our &s;tomach, in which view likewi&s;e they only act as Alum.</P>

O&s;teocolla is a calcarious earth, which has been &s;u&s;pended in water, and afterwards depo&s;ited and concreted in a powdery form, on different &s;ub&s;tances, e&s;pecially the roots of plants, and, from the other matters being &s;eparated by

putrefaction, or otherwi&s;e, called <HI>O&s;teocolla,</HI> from its then being like a hollow tube. Hence al&s;o it was employed in the cure of fractured bones, and hence, probably, too, the &s;uppo&s;ition of Ab|&s;orbent Earths being a&s;tringent. In no one in&s;tance do I think this is well founded. With vegetable Acids they even form a laxative &s;ub&s;tance, nor to the ta&s;te do they &s;hew any au&s;tere or &s;typtic qua|lity. Formerly we employed an animal Earth procured from bones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Hart&s;horn,</HI> which was, when calcined, particularly u&s;ed in a&s;tringent decoctions, as the <HI>Decoctum album.</HI> Here I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that this is an in&s;oluble &s;ub&s;tance, hardly yielding to Acids, and only as uniting with Acids do earths &s;eem to act in the human body. In&s;tead of calcined Hart&s;horn, we have introduced into the <HI>Decoctum album,</HI> Chalk and Crabs eyes, though I am afraid on no very good foundation, as Chalk, united with Acids, has no a&s;tringent quality, but is rather laxative.

However, on the whole, I believe the calcined Hart&s;horn preferable to Chalk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which we now employ, for although it unites &s;paringly with acids, yet part of it is &s;till corroded by them, and acts as an Alum.</P>

<P>The chief, and perhaps the only one of the&s;e, is Alum. This is a &s;ub&s;tance with who&s;e chemical hi&s;tory we are but lately ac|quainted. Formerly it was &s;uppo&s;ed the vitriolic acid in Alum was joined to a calcarious earth, and this perhaps, as well as the rea&s;ons before given, contributed to give ri&s;e to the opinion of calcarious earths being thought a&s;tringent, when joined with acids.

<P>Alum is found native in a fine fibrous form, called then <HI>Alumen plumo&s;um.</HI> This is &s;o &s;carce as to be mi&s;taken for <HI>Amianthus,</HI> which often in our &s;hops is &s;ub&s;tituted for it.

<DIV3 TYPE="characteristics">
<HEAD>VIRTUES of ALUM.</HEAD>
<P>From experience, Alum is found to be a powerful A&s;tringent, and perhaps one of the mo&s;t &s;afe. Being readily di&s;&s;olved, it acts quickly, and is one of tho&s;e A&s;tringents, which extends its action over the &s;y&s;tem; its effects appearing much &s;ooner than we po&s;&s;ibly could &s;uppo&s;e them to be, (in con&s;equence of the circulation) in the part affected. It acts more quickly, and in a &s;maller do&s;e, than the ve|getable A&s;tringents, and is le&s;s deleterious, le&s;s &s;timulant, and of more general u&s;e than the metallic. Alum is one of tho&s;e A&s;tringents which we can mo&s;t conveniently employ externally. It is often employed in Inflammations of the Eyes. Alum not only contracts the fibres, but dimini&s;hes the mobility, &s;o that it here acts in two ways, by correcting the laxity of the ve&s;&s;els, and at the &s;ame time dimini&s;hing the impetus of the fluids. The white of egg, with which it is commonly joined for this purpo&s;e, has been thought to
<PB N="184" REF="014000_0190_0F928686CF91D318">
have particular virtues, but in my opinion it has no other in this ca&s;e, than that of giving con&s;i&s;tence, and contributing to more convenient exhibition. Alum is al&s;o u&s;ed for bracing lax and flaccid gums in &s;corbutic habits, for which purpo&s;e the vegetable A&s;tringents have little effect, and the metallic, on account of their bad ta&s;te, &s;trength, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are improper. Alum is applied with advantage in inflammati|ons of the throat, and <HI>anginas,</HI> where there is much laxity. Syden|ham here formerly propo&s;ed the vitriolic acid alone in &s;trong do&s;es, but be&s;ides the too great &s;trength of his do&s;es, the vitriolic acid, mitigated by the earth in Alum, an&s;wers much better.</P>
<P>Externally Alum has been employed to dry up exce&s;&s;ive excre|tions of the &s;kin, as &s;weat in the armpits, with &s;ucce&s;s. But here I need not repeat what I have &s;aid formerly about the drying up &s;uch excretions at all.</P>
<P>Internally it is u&s;ed in Haemorrhages as an A&s;tringent. In Hae|morrhages of the <HI>uterus</HI> it is the &s;ub&s;tance we can mo&s;t depend upon. For this purpo&s;e it is generally employed in the <HI>Pulvis &s;typticus.</HI> The <HI>Sanguis draconis,</HI> with which it was there joined, has been imagined an A&s;tringent, but to me it &s;eems to have very little of that power, as not being &s;oluble in our fluids, and I think an improvement is made in the la&s;t edition of the <HI>Pharmacopoeia Pauperum,</HI> in &s;ub&s;ti|tuting for this the <HI>Terra Japonica.</HI> We have lo&s;t the original in|tention of Helvetius in addition of the <HI>Sanguis draconis,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that of forming the Alum into pills, which is often required for more con|venient exhibition. It is done by melting the <HI>Sanguis draconis</HI> on the fire, and mixing with it a proper proportion of Alum, and this is the only means of reducing Alum into this form, and the only proper u&s;e of the <HI>Sanguis draconis.</HI></P>
<P>Alum may be employed in all ca&s;es where A&s;tringents are u&s;ed. In <HI>diarrhoeas,</HI> &amp;c. it has been little u&s;ed, but here it might not only act by bracing the inte&s;tines, but as an anti&s;eptic, e&s;pecially if exhibit|ed in &s;mall do&s;es.</P>

<P>It is a powerful &s;timulant, very immediately and in &s;mall do&s;es exciting vomiting, in&s;omuch as to make it difficult to exhibit it with|out this effect. Here, then, we have rea&s;on to be anxious in the choice of the preparation. We &s;hould mo&s;tly avoid the combination with acids, univer&s;ally that with alkalis, and prefer the neutral &s;alts. In the inte&s;tines, Copper acts as a purgative, and may be u&s;ed with advantage in hydropic ca&s;es, not only on this account, but al&s;o on the diuretic quality it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es when properly managed. Whether Copper exerts this diuretic quality in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> or by being a&s;&s;umed into the ma&s;s of blood, I &s;hall not determine.</P>
<P>Copper, too, acts as an A&s;tringent in &s;topping Evacuations; but we &s;eldom can throw it in, without its &s;timulating effects. For this purpo&s;e, <HI>Ens Veneris</HI> was recommended by Boyle; but after|wards neglected. There has been a di&s;pute among the Chemi&s;ts, whether Mr. Boyle's <HI>Ens Veneris</HI> was procured from Iron or Cop|per. Boyle him&s;elf tells us, that he u&s;ed a pure venereal vitriol, and be&s;ides, it is impo&s;&s;ible to imitate the properties of the <HI>Ens Veneris</HI> by any preparation of Iron. This preparation is to be con&s;idered as a combination of Copper with an ammoniacal Salt, and &s;ometimes with a portion of muriatic acid. This pre|paration
<PB N="187" REF="014000_0193_0F928688EE55C160">
may be obtained in Chry&s;tals in the following manner, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by adding gradually to a &s;olution of blue vitriol in water, a volatile alkali, till no longer any cloud appear in the addition; after which, to the diaphanous liquor, pouring on as much alcohol as is &s;ufficient to &s;eparate the water; after which, very elegant &s;mall &s;apphire coloured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By being chry&s;tallized thus, it is freed from all adhering acid, and is rendered more a&s;tringent. <HI>Vid.</HI> Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, <HI>de Cupro</HI> Edin. 1757.</NOTE> chry&s;tals will concrete. <HI>Vid.

Wherever Copper is introduced in this form, it acts as an A&s;tringent, and de&s;troys the mobility of the nervous power, and &s;o is very u&s;eful in that di&s;ea&s;e of univer&s;al laxity, the Rickets, as Boyle ob&s;erves. It is al&s;o anti&s;pa&s;modic, and has been pre&s;cribed in the Epilep&s;y, as I my&s;elf have &s;ometimes ob&s;erved, with appearance of &s;ucce&s;s; where its action would &s;eem to depend on giving a ten&s;ion to the &s;y&s;tem, and de&s;troying that irritability on which Epilep&s;y &s;eems to depend. Boyle al&s;o recommends <HI>Ens Veneris</HI> as an anodyne, when he &s;ays it acts without the inflammable qualities of opium, the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> produced. Experience, however, does not &s;eem to confirm this.</P>
<P>Boyle recommends Copper in petechial fevers, with <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus tendinum,</HI> &amp;c. and found that it &s;topt the&s;e, and brought the fever to a happy i&s;&s;ue. Van Swieten tells us of a preparation of Copper, which, immediately after taking, produces a <HI>formicatio</HI> over the whole body, without any of the bad effects which occur from the &s;timulating power of Copper, and that it is an efficacious medicine in the Epilep&s;y. The method of preparation of it has not yet been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Out of the body, Copper kills Worms; but from its &s;timulating powers, it is very difficult to exhibit it internally for that pur|po&s;e.

I &s;hall here mention one par|ticular in&s;tance of a di&s;ea&s;e not known in the books of Phy&s;ic, where the effects of Copper were remarkable. A di&s;order in this country appeared a good many years ago, with exulcerations of the mouth, and fauces, with ulcers in the tongue, about the anus, and in different parts of the body, re&s;embling the venereal di&s;ea&s;e; but di&s;tingui&s;hed by the different &s;loughs of the ulcers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pinnated to it.</NOTE>, by the different manner of its appearance, its want of infection from carnal communication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mercury in this di&s;ea&s;e was tried with no &s;ucce&s;s; but Copper almo&s;t always effected a cure.

<HEAD>VIRTUES of IRON.</HEAD>
<P>Iron is purely a&s;tringent, without the &s;timulating qualities of copper, or the deleterious ones of lead. However, neither is it &s;o powerful an a&s;tringent as the one, nor &s;o powerful an anti&s;pa&s;modic as the other. The aperient and a&s;tringent preparations of Iron are the &s;ame, differing only in degree of virtue. In all ca&s;es of laxity and debility, and in ob&s;tructions and &s;lowne&s;s, proceeding from the&s;e cau&s;es, Iron is employed, though other &s;imple a&s;tringents might al&s;o an&s;wer the effect. Here we ought to beware of a &s;udden a&s;triction, which may be attended with bad con&s;equences, and, therefore, in exhibiting it in the&s;e ca&s;es, we &s;hould give it in &s;mall do&s;es, and tru&s;t to length of time for a cure; and by this means we &s;hall avoid tho&s;e inconveniences, of which Phy&s;icians often complain in pre|parations of Iron.</P>
<P>Mineral waters often produce cures, which we in vain attempt to perform by the combinations in our &s;hops; even although the&s;e waters contain nothing but Iron. This is manife&s;tly owing to the weakne&s;s of the do&s;e; in proof of which we find, that the &s;trongly impregnated water &s;eldom an&s;wer &s;o well, as tho&s;e weak ones we commonly reject. Iron may be employed as an anti&s;pa&s;modic, and then mu&s;t be u&s;ed in &s;mall do&s;es. Hy&s;teric ca&s;es are tho&s;e in which it is commonly u&s;ed, and then &s;ometimes bad effects attend its exhibition. Different rea&s;ons have been given for this. That given by Carthu&s;er &s;eems not without foundation, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that often in the&s;e ca&s;es there are ob&s;tructions of the vi&s;cera, which are confirm|ed by the u&s;e of Iron, but that if the&s;e are removed, it proves a valuable cure. There is another di&s;tinction which I would make between the Hypochondriac and Hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;es, which influences our practice very much. The Hypochondriac di&s;ea&s;e often depends on a rigidity of the &s;olids, is a di&s;ea&s;e of the habit, and occurs in the decline of life; whereas the Hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e is often attended with a laxity of the &s;olids, is often inci|dental, and is more purely &s;pa&s;modic. In Hy&s;teric ca&s;es, the

Iron may be employed with &s;ucce&s;s, while in the Hypochondriac it is hurtful.</P>
<P>Iron has al&s;o been employed in Intermittent Fevers. Stahl and his followers, laying it always down as a rule, that a fever being an effort of nature to throw off from the body &s;ome morbid matter, thought they very &s;eldom ought to be &s;topped; and even in Agues, on this account, they have been very &s;paring of the Pe|ruvian Bark. They u&s;ed, however, for this purpo&s;e of Intermit|tents a very &s;ubtile Crocus of Iron, obtained by applying nitre to the martial regulus of Antimony in fu&s;ion. We &s;hall afterwards find that this acts in the &s;ame manner as other A&s;tringents, and even as Peruvian Bark it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Iron, as a&s;tringent, is improper in inflammable ca&s;es. Some A&s;tringents are employed in Continual Fevers, but Iron ought to be avoided, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the inflammatory diathe&s;is. This applies to other ca&s;es, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is more commonly u&s;ed, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in Hae|morrhages, <HI>e. g.</HI> in the Haemopto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;is. This &s;ometimes may depend on a laxity of the &s;olids, but much oftner owes its ri&s;e to an encrea&s;ed impetus of the fluids. This ca&s;e, if not inflammatory, is very nearly akin to it, and the &s;ame cru&s;t occurs in the blood as in other inflammatory ca&s;es. Iron, then, in the&s;e ca&s;es, ought to be given with great caution, for Haemoptoes are often the cau&s;es of Phthi&s;is, or Con&s;umption of the Lungs. Iron, in the&s;e ca&s;es, by its &s;udden a&s;triction may &s;top the flux, but then the inflammatory diathe&s;is is continued, and often a &s;uppuration brought on. Even Alum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not very proper, and bleeding and the antiphlogi&s;tic method is much preferable.</P>

<HEAD>LEAD.</HEAD>
<P>This is not u&s;ed in medicine, except when combined with other bodies. With oil its calces combine and form the common pla&s;ter, which is the foundation of mo&s;t of the re&s;t. To this pla&s;ter, Lead gives no other property, but that of con&s;i&s;tence. Lead unites with the &s;everal acids. For medical u&s;e the vegetable is commonly u&s;ed, and acts on it as well as the others. The preparations with this acid and lead in common u&s;e are the <HI>Saccharum Saturni, Acetum Lithar|gytes,</HI> and common <HI>Ceru&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Externally Lead is u&s;ed as an a&s;tringent. It dimini&s;hes the mobi|lity more than alum, <HI>e. g.</HI> in &s;ore eyes. But let it be ob&s;erved here, that Lead ab&s;olutely de&s;troys the mobility of our fibres. Lead has been u&s;ed in ery&s;ipelas, but in general a&s;tringents are often improper in this ca&s;e, and great caution is to be enjoined in the u&s;e of Lead, as it often brings on pal&s;y in our fibres. I my&s;elf have &s;een it produce gangrene in the ery&s;ipelas.</P>
<P>In burns it is often employed in the <HI>Unguentum album;</HI> but if long u&s;ed, it induces flaccidity of the part, and makes the ulcers difficult to heal. Mercury and Lead, combined, have cured &s;crophulous ulcers, where other means had failed; but a caution

<P>Internally Lead is a powerful A&s;tringent, and is employed in Hae|morrhages. We mu&s;t, however, always be aware of its deleterious effects.</P>
<P>Every body knows its bad con&s;equences to the Miners; and the cu&s;tom which &s;ome Vintners had formerly of mixing Lead with their wine, in order to obviate its acidity, which indeed it did powerfully, &s;hewed &s;ufficiently its poi&s;onous effects. In Haemorrhages, its action is on the nervous power; for it is never given in &s;uch quantity as to &s;top the Haemorrhage by corrugating the fibres, or coagulating the ma&s;s of blood. Its effects being of this kind, have made it to be employed in <HI>Diarrhoeas</HI> and <HI>Dy&s;enteries,</HI> in the <HI>Fluor albus</HI> and <HI>Gonorrhoeas.</HI> In all the&s;e ca&s;es its effects are powerful, &s;o that I could wi&s;h to be able to inculcate its u&s;e. For a few do&s;es, if we have occa&s;ion for it, may &s;ometimes be u&s;ed without bad effects; but if its u&s;e is continued for any length of time, its bad con&s;equences will certainly appear.</P>
<P><HI>Saccharum Saturni</HI> and <HI>Tinctura antiphthi&s;ica,</HI> into which that certainly enters, have been employed in Continual Fevers, with re|markable &s;ucce&s;s, not having &s;uch a &s;timulus as the copper, and taking off the nervous &s;ymptoms, the <HI>Delirium, Sub&s;ultus tendinum, &amp;c.</HI> as may be &s;een in the <HI>Acta Naturae Curio&s;orum.</HI> I have no manner of doubt of its efficacy in this re&s;pect as an A&s;tringent, and con&s;equently an Anti&s;pa&s;modic, but as its effects in any large quan|tity are &s;o pernicious, in &s;pite of the recommendations of &s;everal Germans, we &s;hould always u&s;e &s;uch a remedy with very great caution.</P>

<P>We now proceed to the&s;e; for the Animal Kingdom &s;carcely fur|ni&s;hes any A&s;tringents, except the Animal Earth, commonly called calcined Hart&s;horn, be reckoned as &s;uch.</P>
<P>With regard to Vegetable A&s;tringents, they are of le&s;s &s;udden operation than tho&s;e of the Fo&s;&s;ile Kingdom.</P>
<P>I imagine Vegetable A&s;tringents, as well as all others, act in the <HI>primae viae;</HI> but the &s;timulus of metallic A&s;tringents, makes their

effects much more propagated over the &s;y&s;tem, than tho&s;e of the vegetable. Applied to the tongue, Vegetable A&s;tringents give a much weaker impre&s;&s;ion, and there is no Phy&s;ician will have re|cour&s;e to them for &s;topping Haemorrhages, upon any exigency. They may indeed exert their powers over the &s;y&s;tem, but then they do &s;o, only &s;lowly and gradually. Vegetable A&s;tringents, when we want them to be efficacious, mu&s;t be exhibited in &s;ub&s;tance. This has been little attended to. The rea&s;on for this method of exhi|bition is, becau&s;e we have no powerful men&s;truums for their &s;olution. We have, indeed, water and alcohol, but the former will not di&s;&s;olve one ounce of any a&s;tringent without repeated affu&s;ions and decoctions; and with the latter a very great quantity of the men|&s;truum is requi&s;ite; and, after all, in either ca&s;e, the impregnation is incon&s;iderable, We do not chu&s;e to u&s;e the&s;e &s;olutions for an|other rea&s;on, becau&s;e the means u&s;ed for &s;olution have an effect upon the medicine; much heat and long boiling actually de&s;troying the a&s;tringent quality and vegetable texture. Water, too, although it wa&s;hes out the a&s;tringent quality, when boiling, and &s;eemingly &s;u&s;pends it, yet upon cooling, depo&s;its much of what it had taken up. Upon the&s;e accounts, Vegetable A&s;tringents &s;hould, if po&s;&s;i|ble be given in &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on not commonly given, why the Vegetable A&s;trin|gents are weaker than the Fo&s;&s;ile, and why they &s;hould be always admini&s;tred in &s;ub&s;tance, is, that the Vegetable A&s;tringents may have their texture de&s;troyed in our &s;tomach, from the fermentation going on there; whereas the Fo&s;&s;ile A&s;tringents are not liable to this effect, and can only be hurt by mixture.</P>
<P>There is a curious ob&s;ervation of the late worthy Dr. Al&s;ton, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that the Peruvian Bark, operating in the &s;tomach, remains for a long time in the &s;olid form in which it is exhibited, and there is great rea&s;on to believe, that all Vegetable A&s;tringents act in the &s;ame manner. I my&s;elf have &s;een Peruvian Bark thrown up, un|changed, after having remained in the &s;tomach eight days. Hence
<PB N="196" REF="014000_0202_0F928B9E42B28D40">
if we throw in this, or other a&s;tringents, in a fluid form, both becau&s;e they are liable to pa&s;s ea&s;ily off, and becau&s;e they are thus more &s;ubject to the fermentative proce&s;s, we may often be di&s;ap|pointed in their &s;ucce&s;s. Here al&s;o is an additional rea&s;on for the &s;udden operation of the Fo&s;&s;ile A&s;tringents, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> becau&s;e they are more quickly di&s;&s;olved than the vegetable. But wherever there is danger from a &s;udden a&s;triction, and wherever a &s;low operation is re|quired, the Vegetable A&s;tringents are preferable, and are univer&s;ally u&s;ed in all &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Vegetable A&s;tringents are recommended in Haemorrhoidal Swel|lings and Bleedings, but it is extremely doubtful, how far their u&s;e is proper. Wherever the&s;e are the effects of <HI>plethora,</HI> and Nature attempting a di&s;charge, we mu&s;t be very &s;paring in the u&s;e of A&s;tringents. But this is not always the ca&s;e; they are often in con&s;equence of a habit induced of co&s;tivene&s;s, where the blood, hindered in its pa&s;&s;age, is poured out into the cellular membrane, and the <HI>ecchymo&s;es</HI> there kept up on account of laxity; for it is not owing to a varicous di&s;tention of the veins, as &s;ome have imagined; for in&s;pection proves the contrary. In this ca&s;e, where the &s;welling is kept up from laxity, Vegetable A&s;tringents may be of con&s;iderable &s;ervice. But &s;ometimes, although the&s;e evacuations are not na|tural, yet they are habitual, and when &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;uddenly, may bring on equally bad effects, as if they were critical; &s;o that Fo&s;&s;ile A&s;tringents are not to be u&s;ed here, on account of their being apt to induce a &s;udden a&s;triction. Vegetable A&s;tringents, then, are preferable, becau&s;e they operate &s;lowly and gradually on the con|&s;titution; but even the&s;e, from a long continued u&s;e, are liable to bring on a co&s;tivene&s;s, which is ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent, with the cure of Haemorrhoidal Fluxes. In the exhibition, then, of the&s;e A&s;tringents, we &s;hould always take care to obviate this co&s;tivene&s;s they are &s;o apt to produce.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much of Vegetable A&s;tringents in general, I now proceed to talk of particulars; where, indeed, properly we

&s;hall have little to &s;ay upon each. If you look into <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers, you will find them, under each particular A&s;tringent, telling you, that it is fit for Spitting of blood, <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> Dy&s;entery, <HI>Fluor albus,</HI> and every other fancied encrea&s;ed excretion; in order to &s;well up their volumes. They do not always, however, put all of the&s;e under each particular &s;imple, but di&s;tribute their di&s;ea&s;es to peculiar ones, and &s;ay, that this is good in Dy&s;entery, that in <HI>Fluor albus, &amp;c.</HI> All this, however, is not always merely for o&s;tentation; for it &s;ometimes happened that one, accidentally being pre&s;cribed in a particular ca&s;e, was afterwards always u&s;ed for the &s;ame; al|though the others might have an&s;wered equally well. You will not, then, expect that I &s;hall follow the&s;e writers in this method of procedure. I &s;hall only mention where a particular A&s;tringent is accompanied with &s;ome other peculiar property which modifies its operation.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve here, that I have thrown the &s;ub&s;tances into di&s;tinct <HI>fa&s;ciculi,</HI> with blank &s;paces and letters between. Many of the&s;e &s;paces may be filled up with the name of the natural order of Linnaeus.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t eight at <HI>a</HI> belong to the <HI>Sentico&s;ae</HI> of Linnaeus, and is the thirty-fifth order of his <HI>Fragmenta.</HI> This natural order is better e&s;tabli&s;hed than many of the others. They are all of one common quality, but &s;ome of them are not u&s;ed in medicine. I have only &s;et down &s;uch as are to be found in our Di&s;pen&s;atory li&s;ts. If in any place of the world the&s;e I have mentioned are not to be found, we may &s;afely &s;ub&s;titute for them any others of the &s;ame natural order. With regard to this order, as all the <HI>genera</HI> agree, &s;o do each of the &s;pecies in virtue; &s;o that be&s;ides the officinal &s;pecies we may take any one &s;pecies of any of the&s;e <HI>genera,</HI> for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Whence we &s;ee the exten&s;ive u&s;e of di&s;tributing plants according to their natural order in Botany, if this is made up with &s;ufficient accuracy. It has been common for <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers to introduce the variety of names, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> under each par|ticular
<PB N="198" REF="014000_0204_0F928BA2D921AB88">
&s;ub&s;tance; but I think it is much better to refer you to the late Authors, e&s;pecially to Linnaeus's <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> where you will find his own name, Ca&s;par Bauhine's name, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which means you will be enabled to get the names of other authors.</P>
<P>The&s;e preliminaries thus &s;ettled, as to the eight plants, at the head of which is <HI>Agrimonia,</HI> they are all of the &s;ame virtues, which are &s;hortly &s;ummed up in their A&s;tringency. They may po&s;&s;e&s;s diffe|rent degrees of this, but that difference is not a&s;certained; in qua|lity they hardly differ. Some of them have annexed to their A&s;|tringency &s;ome other qualities, <HI>e. g. Argentina</HI> root has a &s;weet with its A&s;tringency; <HI>Fragaria</HI> more Bitterne&s;s than any of the others; in <HI>Tormentilla, Caryophillata,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ome <HI>aroma.</HI> Except from Sir John Floyer, I have got very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the &s;en|&s;ible qualities; for Lewis has copied him very inaccurately, or, when he has advanced any thing of his own, has done it im|perfectly.</P>
<P>With regard to the&s;e plants, as they &s;tand in our &s;hops, the fir&s;t five &s;tand in the Edinburgh, and not in the London Di&s;pen&s;atory. But neither in the former are they in&s;erted from any particular vir|tue, but only from a timidity of rejecting too many &s;ub&s;tances; thinking it better, as in &s;ome editions of the Di&s;pen&s;atory it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed, <HI>copia quam penuria premi;</HI> neither again have the Lon|don College expunged them from any noxious quality, but only from their not being u&s;ed in pre&s;ent practice; which, by the bye, is far from being a te&s;t of the inefficacy of medicines. However, it is certainly true, that the three which the London College retain, are certainly the mo&s;t powerful; for we u&s;e only the herbs of the fir&s;t, whereas the A&s;tringency re&s;ides mo&s;t in Barks.</P>
<P>The London College &s;till retain the Ro&s;e, on account of its fra|grancy; but certainly <HI>Quinquefolium</HI> and <HI>Tormentilla</HI> are the mo&s;t powerful of the eight &s;et down; whether we tru&s;t to experience, or
<PB N="199" REF="014000_0205_0F928BA3F96B3418">
their &s;en&s;ible qualities. As to the &s;en&s;ible qualities, in the leaves there is a mucilaginous quality, in the roots the A&s;tringency is more pure and entire. <HI>Quinquefolium</HI> and <HI>Tormentilla</HI> are both remark|able A&s;tringents, and have the &s;ame virtue with the&s;e. The fir&s;t has been u&s;ed by Hippocrates, and &s;ince his time in the cure of In|termittent Fevers. Many other common A&s;tringents have been u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The <HI>Quinquefolium</HI> has a Bitterne&s;s with its A&s;tringency, which is perhaps nece&s;&s;ary in the cure of Intermittents, as the Bark po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it &s;o much. The Germans u&s;e <HI>Tormentilla</HI> for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, but join it with Gentian and other Bitters, which they &s;ay an&s;wers equally well with the Bark in the cure of Intermit|tents. <HI>Tormentilla,</HI> and other A&s;tringents, have al&s;o been &s;poken of for their alexipharmic virtues in pe&s;tilential di&s;orders; that is, in putrid continual Fevers. In Germany, <HI>Tormentil,</HI> &amp;c. have been u&s;ed in the Small pox; &s;o that hence we may &s;uppo&s;e, that other A&s;tringents, be&s;ides the Bark, may be u&s;eful in Fevers, in bringing on &s;uppuration.</P>
<P><HI>Tormentilla</HI> and <HI>Quinquefolium</HI> may be extracted by water or alco|hol, but from either, a &s;light impregnation is procured, and much boiling in water deprives them of &s;omewhat of that a&s;tringency.</P>

<P><HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers have commonly under do&s;ed the&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances. The medical virtues of the roots are almo&s;t all lodged in the cortical parts; &s;o that when the roots are &s;o large, that you can throw away the pith, the do&s;e may be in a &s;maller quantity, than if we employed the entire root. When thus prepared, they may be given in a do&s;e of half a drachm or one drachm, and where a more &s;udden a&s;triction is wanted, we repeat the do&s;e &s;o often, as to give one ounce in twenty-four hours, as in the u&s;e of the Bark.</P>

is but a &s;mall order, even among the Botani&s;ts. The three &s;et down are what are retained in the Edinburgh Li&s;t. The London College only retain the <HI>Rubia.</HI> They all po&s;&s;e&s;s the a&s;tringent qua|lity &s;o weakly, that they may be rejected. They are con&s;tantly marked by <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers as Diuretics. We might reject this as imaginary, were it not &s;o con&s;tantly repeated, and, indeed, by authors of &s;ome credit; &s;o that we &s;hould always have this qua|lity in contemplation. To other A&s;tringents the &s;ame property has been attributed; but for my part, I am able to give no rea&s;on for it. <HI>Rubia</HI> has been lately ob&s;erved to colour the bones of animals who feed upon it. Long ago it was ob&s;erved to have the power of colouring the urine, and by &s;ome experiments of Dr. Young, it has been al&s;o found to colour the milk. This &s;hews that vegetable &s;ub&s;tances penetrate farther, unchanged, into the &s;y&s;tem, than has been imagin|ed. It &s;eems to contradict what I was &s;aying, of Vegetables undergoing a change in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and having their pecu|liar qualities de&s;troyed. Here we &s;ee the colouring &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>Rubia</HI> carried through the circulation, and depo&s;ited in the excretions, but how far this retention of colour implies a reten|tion of virtue, I &s;hall not &s;ay. Often the colouring matter re|&s;ides in a very &s;mall quantity, and diffu&s;ion of &s;ub&s;tances often prevents their operation; &s;o that the reuniting of the colouring &s;ub&s;tance in the excretions is no proof of its being in &s;uch quantity in the blood, as to produce any con&s;iderable effect. Madder is found to change the health of the animal who takes it, making it di&s;pirited, &s;luggi&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence, then, we &s;ee it certainly exerts powers over the &s;y&s;tem, and whatever has the power of even hurting, may be of u&s;e in medicine. But with regard to the <HI>Rubia,</HI> as it requires very large quantities, it cannot be u&s;ed, and its do&s;e is uncertain. <HI>Rubia</HI> has been recommended in the Jaundice, but may &s;afely be rejected, with many other medicines recommended for the &s;ame malady; and there is no tribe of Me|dicines which may more &s;afely be &s;o, than tho&s;e recommended for this purpo&s;e. Now we know that this di&s;ea&s;e depends &s;o often on &s;tones in the biliary duct, and can only be cured by &s;olution or
<PB N="201" REF="014000_0207_0F928BA4F6747DA0">
evacuation, and as very few medicines can produce this effect, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Rubia</HI> of any con&s;equence in this di&s;ea&s;e. The cure of the Jaundice is almo&s;t always &s;udden, from the &s;tone being evacuated, and hence it is that many medicines have been &s;uppo&s;ed to cure the Jaundice, from their being luckily given when that effect happened. The cure, then, of this di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t depend on &s;olution, or evacuation.

<P>With regard to this &s;et of Plants, they differ al&s;o in another way, many of them containing an Acid be&s;ide their A&s;tringency, and in this &s;et of plants we have the different gradations of acid, au&s;tere, and acerb. The A&s;tringency is lodged chiefly in the roots, the more pure Acidity in the leaves. In the roots al&s;o there is frequently, more or le&s;s of a purgative quality, mo&s;t remarkably in the <HI>Rheum,</HI> though in &s;ome degree al&s;o in the <HI>Lapatha,</HI> or Dock kind, &s;o much a-kin to it. There has been a di&s;pute about this purgative quality in the Dock kind. Their A&s;tringency in this country is often &s;o great, as to overpower that effect, but this does not at all refute the truth of that a&s;&s;ertion; and I my&s;elf have &s;een Monks Rhubarb&punc; given in &s;ufficient quantity, produce that effect. The <HI>Bi&s;torta</HI> of all the&s;e Plants contains the &s;imple&s;t and pure&s;t A&s;tringency, and therefore is of mo&s;t frequent u&s;e as an A&s;tringent.</P>

A&s;tringents are frequently of u&s;e in Scurvy. The <HI>Vaginales</HI> are more frequently employed for this purpo&s;e, though at the &s;ame time there are in&s;tances of the others being employed in the &s;ame way, which prevent our thinking that this virtue in them is pecu|liar. In the&s;e, however, their Acidity may add to their effect; for that, either &s;eparate or conjoined into Acerbity, is found mo&s;t appropriated to the Scurvy. Here the vague and undetermined no|tion of the Scurvy has occa&s;ioned confu&s;ion in the <HI>Materia Medica.</HI> This term has been transferred to many cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, which are of a very different nature, and with who&s;e nature we are not &s;o well acquainted.

that the roots have been employed in times of &s;carcity, as food; we cannot &s;uppo&s;e them very efficacious, as medicines. But, though &s;ome of the&s;e may thus be employed, yet many are too a&s;tringent to be nutritive, and many have a &s;en&s;ible acrimony. <HI>Polypody,</HI> one of the&s;e, on account of its acrimony, is transferred to the purgatives; and as this quality is very &s;en&s;ible in one, we &s;hould always con&s;ider that it may be in the others. It is &s;aid, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure vouched, that the roots of &s;ome of our plants have been u&s;eful in de&s;troying Worms.

We may with more &s;afety reject their hepatic and &s;plenetic virtues. How medicines act on the&s;e <HI>vi&s;cera,</HI> is at all times very difficult to explain, and a &s;pecific virtue is perfectly unintelligible. If the liver or &s;pleen are &s;pa&s;modically affected, the Ferns, as An|ti&s;pa&s;modics, may be u&s;eful, but that they can take down the Spleen, or make it di&s;appear altogether, is a mere chimera.

<HEAD>ACIDO AUSTERE, or ACERB.</HEAD>
<P>We have now fini&s;hed tho&s;e A&s;tringents which can be ranged in botanical order; I have, therefore, next pur&s;ued the analogy of the &s;en&s;ible qualities. The number of the <HI>Acido au&s;tere</HI> might have been much encrea&s;ed, by adding all unripe fruits; but I have con|fined my&s;elf to &s;uch as have this quality in their ripe &s;tate.

efficacy; though from all this I would not have you conclude, that I think the general rule, of Nature's having given to every particular country remedies adapted to all its di&s;ea&s;es, to be true. I &s;hall only mention the Sloe, as I think it may &s;erve for all the re&s;t. In the Edinburgh Di&s;pen&s;atory, an Extract is ordered to be made of this; in the London, a Con&s;erve. As it is a &s;ub&s;tance that acts more on the <HI>primae viae,</HI> than in remote places, its acerbity will, perhaps, make it preferable, in the Dy&s;entery, to the more pure au&s;tere. <HI>Diar|rhoeas,</HI> though <HI>&s;eldom</HI> epidemic ones, may be brought on by eat|ing too much ripe fruits; to obviate who&s;e effects the acerb will be proper; but then they mu&s;t be &s;uch as are not liable to a fermenta|tion; &s;o that when &s;weetne&s;s, the cau&s;e of fermentation, is joined, tho&s;e will be improper, and they &s;hould be more acerb than &s;weet. The preparation, then, of the London College, by adding three parts of &s;ugar, is certainly wrong; neither is that of Edinburgh without its di&s;advantages; for, by long continued coction, the a&s;tringency is apt to be de&s;troyed, and, if the extract be dried, towards the end of the proce&s;s, it is rendered a very difficultly diffu&s;ible &s;ub&s;tance. In my opinion, a medium is be&s;t. It ought to be made like elder-rob, boiled to a certain height, and then &s;ome &s;ugar added, to keep it diffu&s;ible. This method of treatment will apply to other &s;ub&s;tances.</P>

<P>Much &s;uper&s;tition has been mixed with the u&s;e of this medicine; &s;o much, that its real qualities have been &s;uppo&s;ed fal&s;e. But in this I cannot agree. It has been particularly famous in the cure of Epilep&s;y. When Epilep&s;y proceeds from an increa&s;ed mobility, al|lowing the &s;pa&s;modic affection to recur upon &s;light occa&s;ional cau&s;es, A&s;tringents are certainly u&s;eful, and in this ca&s;e have I &s;een the Mi&s;letoe u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s. It has Bitterne&s;s joined with its A&s;trin|gency; and Sir John Floyer &s;ays, that he has &s;een it in &s;ome in|&s;tances cure Quartans, where the do&s;e was con&s;iderable, and con|tinued for a length of time. This remedy gained great reputation in England, where &s;everal treati&s;es have been written upon it; and Cartheu&s;er now gives his te&s;timony in &s;upport of its virtues.

<HEAD>UVA URSI.</HEAD>
<P>This is a title which has &s;eldom appeared in the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> and never in any officinal li&s;t. <HI>Uva Ur&s;i</HI> is not the proper botanical appellation. From the Practitioners at Vienna, we have accounts of very extraordinary virtues imputed to this plant. If the&s;e turn out to be true, it will &s;hew us that very curious virtues may be lodged in un&s;u&s;pected &s;ub&s;tances. I cannot &s;ay what has led them to make u&s;e of it. It has been recommended by &s;ome as an A&s;trin|gent. The Phy&s;icians of Montpelier have hinted in general, that it is good in calculous ca&s;es. Van Swieten recommended it to De Haen, who tells us, that it has been found a certain cure in all ca&s;es of purulency, and al&s;o in any ulcers of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages; &s;econdly, in calculous ca&s;es, it enables them to retain their urine, and obviates the &s;trangurious pains. It al&s;o changed the appearance of the urine. In &s;ome of the&s;e ca&s;es, where it was bloody, alkaline, and purulent, nay &s;o &s;trongly alkaline as to efferve&s;ce with acids, it brought the urine back to its natural appearance, and made it depo&s;ite a healthy &s;ediment. In &s;ome ca&s;es, indeed, he &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> failed, but the&s;e were &s;uch, that in them the urinary pa&s;&s;ages were in &s;uch morbid &s;tate, that it was pa&s;t the power of Nature to have effected a cure, or even Lithotomy it&s;elf to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

catheter always found the &s;tone of the &s;ame &s;ize and roughne&s;s as before. The plant was always u&s;ed in &s;ub&s;tance. At fir&s;t, De Haen's do&s;e was half a drachm of it powdered, once a day; but he now tells us, in his la&s;t volume, that he u&s;es the &s;ame quantity three times a day. He makes no ob&s;ervation on the operation of the medi|cine, whether it bound the belly, palled the &s;tomach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> neither does he mention the remedies which accompanied it. He only &s;ays, that opiates in the beginning were given, to ea&s;e the pain, and that only injections were thrown in; but that &s;oon both the&s;e were &s;u|per&s;eded as unnece&s;&s;ary. To leave without doubt the efficacy of this remedy, De Haen tells us, that, as it required a length of time, many, when their &s;ymptoms were a little alleviated, tired with the di&s;agree|able do&s;e, laid it a&s;ide, but that &s;oon the &s;ame &s;ymptoms recurred, which were again relieved by returning to this remedy, and that this renewal of the &s;ymptoms from laying a&s;ide of the remedy, and re|lief of them from rea&s;&s;uming it, happened to the &s;ame per&s;ons five or &s;ix times. Taking all the&s;e circum&s;tances together, with the au|thority of two &s;uch remarkable per&s;ons, acting under the eye of &s;o many people, I think we can hardly doubt of the facts. From &s;ome difficulties in theory, and in&s;tances where &s;uch like te&s;timonies have failed, &s;ome doubts may ari&s;e; but certainly the&s;e &s;hould not prevent our making a trial of the medicine.</P>
<P>De Haen has attempted the rationale of this medicine's action, but after many attempts, has at la&s;t given it up, as uncertain. Till we have an opportunity of making the experiment, it is worth while to attempt the rationale. It may be ob&s;erved, and De Haen a&s;&s;i&s;ts me in the ob&s;ervation, that in the Annals of Phy&s;ic there have been many in&s;tances where calculi have been carried in the kidneys and bladder without inconvenience. This is difficult to account for. Some may think the &s;moothne&s;s of the &s;tone to have been the rea&s;on; but it is found, and I have &s;een &s;tones as &s;mooth as poli&s;hed marble, give great unea&s;ine&s;s; while, on the

other hand, rough ones gave none; and even this would not obviate the inconveniences, from the weight of the &s;tone. In&s;tances have been given of lime-water relieving the &s;ymptoms of the &s;tone; while at the &s;ame time, the catheter &s;hewed the &s;tone &s;till remained in the bladder. Dr. Whytt thinks the lime-water acts by di&s;&s;olving the &s;tone into a mucus &s;tate, <HI>i. e.</HI> its &s;urface, and &s;o taking off the a&s;perity. The&s;e, I imagine, will not an&s;wer entirely, and in the <HI>Uva Ur&s;i,</HI> the &s;tones have been found equally rough as before; though the &s;ymptoms have been relieved; and be&s;ides, if the lime-water acted in the way alledged, the di&s;&s;olved mucus mu&s;t be car|ried away by the urine, and if the lime-water continued to act in the &s;ame manner, the whole &s;tone would be di&s;&s;olved, which, in &s;tones of any con&s;iderable largene&s;s, has not been found to be the ca&s;e. We mu&s;t, therefore, endeavour to find &s;ome other explana|tion.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms of the &s;tone do not &s;o much depend on the &s;ize or &s;urface of the &s;tone, as on the acrimony of the urine, which con|&s;tantly accompanies the &s;tone. This is certainly the ca&s;e in the <HI>Uva Ur&s;i,</HI> it removing the bad &s;tate of the urine, with little effect upon the &s;tone, which, except the &s;ymptoms of the &s;tone depended on the acrimony of the urine, would be inconceivable. In &s;tones of the kidneys, the con&s;equent &s;trangury has been &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from con&s;ent of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, but much more probably does it ari&s;e from acrimony of the urine. Here let me throw in an ob|&s;ervation, by the bye. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed a &s;pecious proof of the efficacy of Lime-water, that out of the body it di&s;&s;olves &s;tones; but in the&s;e ca&s;es the very alkaline urine mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to do the &s;ame. In changing the urine, I imagi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Uva Ur&s;i</HI> may act in changing the &s;tate of the &s;ecretory organ, inducing a &s;tricture and &s;trength of the part; &s;o that you &s;ee there might be &s;ome foun|dation for the &s;o often repeated nephritic and lithontriptic virtue of A&s;tringents, by <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers.

As Lime-water and Cau&s;tic Alkali out of the body di&s;&s;olve &s;tones, &s;o they relieve its &s;ymptoms in the &s;ame manner. If it comes out that the <HI>Uva Ur&s;i</HI> has the effects alledged, we mu&s;t certainly then think, that the Lime-water acts more as an A&s;trin|gent than a Solvent; for there are many objections with regard to the &s;olution.</P>

<HEAD>1. ACIDS as ASTRINGENTS.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e were formerly mentioned in the <HI>Nutrientia,</HI> at <HI>a,</HI> in my li&s;t, and will afterwards be &s;o more particularly in my eleventh head, the <HI>Antalkalina,</HI> at 1, and 2. I &s;hall only ju&s;t now &s;ay &s;ome|what on them as a&s;tringent.</P>
<P>That all Acids are A&s;tringents is pretty manife&s;t. Applied to the &s;kin they produce contraction and corrugation. Nothing is more common than for the weake&s;t Acids &s;o much to contract the lips, as to take away their colour, hindering them to receive &s;o much red blood as they received in their natural &s;tate. With regard to the A&s;tringency of Acids, it may be a que&s;tion whether it is naturally connected with particular Acids, or whether it is common to all, and only differs from the different concentration. Thus &s;ome have imagined that the vitriolic and perhaps the muriatic Acid are &s;tronger than the nitrous or vegetable. Whatever is in this, to me there is certainly a difference between the fo&s;&s;ile and vegetable acids. The vegetable Acid, in oppo&s;ition to the fo&s;&s;ile, is capable of being changed in the <HI>primae viae</HI> by fermentation, and of having its acid nature de&s;troyed before they enter the blood. Again, the fo&s;&s;ile Acid &s;timulates the excretories; and if this effect is to be expected from the vegetable, they mu&s;t be given proportionably in greater quantity. I &s;hall go farther with this ob&s;ervation, and &s;ay, that of the vegetable Acid even a difference is to be made. The native Acid is more liable to undergo changes than the fermented, having both the vinous and acetous fermentations to go through, which are pa&s;t in the fermented Acid. Hence a que&s;tion ari&s;es, whether the acid
<PB N="220" REF="014000_0226_0F928BBDC7F1DFE0">
fruits be recommended properly in the Dy&s;entery? To me, indeed, in &s;uch ca&s;es, vinegar would &s;eem preferable, unle&s;s the native Acid had &s;o much acerbity with it, as to have the power of checking the putrefactive fermentation. Hence I imagine there is &s;ome propriety in the practice of the German &s;oldiers in the Dy&s;entery, of taking vinegar and cream. As A&s;tringents in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> the fermented Acid may be proper, but wherever we want to have the effect of the Acid extended farther, as in Haemorrhages, there we &s;hould prefer the fo&s;&s;ile Acids. The&s;e have not only the power of producing con|traction, but al&s;o dimini&s;h the mobility, acting as &s;edatives. With regard to the u&s;e of A&s;tringents in Haemorrhages, it has been ob|jected to its propriety, as their A&s;tringency may often encrea&s;e the impetus of the blood. Now the fo&s;&s;ile Acids obviate this objection, for they not only con&s;tringe, but al&s;o take off the encrea&s;ed impetus of the blood, both as acting like &s;edatives, by dimini&s;hing their moving power, and on the fluids, as far as they enter into them, by allaying their inte&s;tine motion.</P>

<P>The&s;e act as acerb; but are liable to the &s;ame objections as the native Acid.

By this means they may be trouble&s;ome in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and may there be changed before they enter into the blood. Burnt wines are properly employed as A&s;tringents, becau&s;e by this means their au&s;terity is encrea&s;ed, and they are rendered le&s;s liable to ferment. Upon the whole, a&s;tringent wines are of little efficacy, and au&s;tere wines are only to be preferred where a choice of <HI>wine</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary.

<HEAD>EMOLLIENTIA.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e are &s;uch medicines as dimini&s;h the cohe&s;ion of the &s;imple &s;olids, in oppo&s;ition to A&s;tringents. The operation of A&s;tringents is difficult to explain, and is &s;till doubtful, that of Emollients is hardly &s;o. Whether we con&s;ider the &s;imple &s;olids as compo&s;ed of earth, inter&s;per&s;ed with gluten, or take them as a mixt, they may be &s;oftened by the interpo&s;ition of fluid parts, or by thinning the gluten. Po&s;&s;ibly the term laxative would be more proper than emollient, but we are obliged to retain the latter, as the former would be apt to be confounded with eccoprotics. Emollients are applied with a double intention, not only to dimini&s;h the cohe&s;ion, but to &s;often; and may act, either by di&s;&s;olving the gluten, or by introducing a larger proportion of fluid parts into the compo&s;ition of the fibre. Perhaps their action ought not to be entirely confined
<PB N="223" REF="014000_0229_0F928BC032AFAD70">
to this. Around every &s;olid fibre there is a proportion of cellular membrane; nay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have &s;uppo&s;ed, that the whole &s;olids of the body are only conden&s;ed cellular membrane. Hence, then, Emol|lients, without entering into the compo&s;ition of the &s;olid fibre, may act upon them, and produce relaxation, by more fluids being inter|po&s;ed in the cellular texture.</P>
<P>We can hardly &s;ay, that Emollients act upon the moving fibres. They can only do &s;o, in &s;o far as ten&s;ion and firmne&s;s of the &s;imple fibres is connected with the o&s;cillatory power of the <HI>&s;olida viva.</HI> It is not the &s;ame with the Emollients as with the A&s;tringents; for the&s;e la&s;t always extend their action, and have &s;omewhat of a &s;timulating power. If the Emollients propagate their action, it is only in &s;o far as they alter the equilibrium, <HI>i. e.</HI> in cau&s;ing an in|crea&s;ed flow of fluid to the part relaxed. Hence they have been &s;uppo&s;ed Derivatives, but they are very &s;eldom u&s;ed <HI>&s;imply</HI> in this intention. Thus we &s;eldom u&s;e plain oil, <HI>e. g.</HI> as a Derivative, but commonly a&s;&s;i&s;t our Emollients with warmth, which here acts as a &s;timulant, and determines a greater flow of humours to the part. The operation of Emollients occurs only externally; for we can have but little conception of internal Emollients; We can|not &s;uppo&s;e them given in any quantity, &s;ufficient to be introduced in &s;uch proportion, to every &s;olid fibre, as to bring on an univer&s;al relaxation. Indeed, by &s;imple water, we may dimini&s;h the den|&s;ity of the blood, and bring on laxity, and debility of the &s;y&s;tem; but that this is purely by applying as Emollient to the &s;imple &s;olids, is hardly conceivable. Emollients may have &s;ome effect in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and relax the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines; but even there, I am per&s;uaded, their operation is perfectly different from &s;imple relaxation; for the inte&s;tines are lined with a mucus, which will hinder their immediate application to the &s;olid fibres. The effect of warm water on the &s;tomach is a very difficult problem. After reflection, I have not thought of any thing more &s;ati&s;|factory than this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that Nature has given us an inclination for cold, and an aver&s;ion for warm water, which, though a mo&s;t mild

<HEAD>INDICATIONS of EMOLLIENTS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. They are indicated in every ca&s;e of too much dryne&s;s of the &s;imple &s;olids. Here they can only be applied externally, where there are fi&s;&s;ures, chaps, and indurations of the &s;urface. 2. Emol|lients are indicated in all ca&s;es of rigidity, whether it exi&s;t in the &s;imple &s;olids, or in the moving fibres. Where the fir&s;t are within our reach, the effects of Emollients are evident; with regard to the moving fibres, Emollients may act in &s;o far as they fill the cellular texture with water, oil, or mucilage; thus taking off the ten&s;ion of the &s;olid fibres, and &s;o dimini&s;hing the o&s;cillation of the moving. 3. Independent of a morbid rigidity, Emollients are indicated in ca&s;es of inflammation. 4. Emollients are indicated, wherever we want to induce a greater laxity, for the &s;ake of derivation or revul&s;ion. I will not determine here, whether they operate in this ca&s;e by the heat commonly joined with them, or by their moi&s;ture; or whether the relaxation is confined to a particular part, or extended over the &s;y&s;tem. Certain it is, that ten&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;y&s;tem, and that this ten&s;ion depends on the ten&s;ion of the neighbouring parts, and &s;o of the whole &s;y&s;tem; and it is to be imputed to this, that re|laxants, applied to a particular part, will &s;ometimes induce a relaxa|tion of the whole body.</P>

<HEAD>PARTS of EMOLLIENTS in which their VIRTUES re&s;ide.</HEAD>
<P>Wherever any &s;ub&s;tances act as Emollients, it is in con&s;equence of the water, oil, or mucilage they contain; which, wherever they occur without acrimony, are emollient; and wherever that virtue takes place, it is in con&s;equence of one or more of the&s;e. Water, as penetrating more immediately, is, perhaps, mo&s;t con|&s;iderable in producing relaxation; but then it has the di&s;advantage of being &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, of taking off with it part of the animal gluten, and of leaving the &s;olids more friable than before. If oil could be as ea&s;ily introduced, its effects would be much more du|rable, without the inconveniency of water. The extremities of the apertures of the ve&s;&s;els on the &s;urface are extremely apt to be affected with any thing blocking them up. In warm countries, where <HI>&s;ordes</HI> are very apt to adhere to the &s;kin, warm bath is u&s;ed to clean them off. At the &s;ame time unction is u&s;ed to obviate the cri&s;pature, to which the &s;kin would be liable, to prevent its chapping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mucilages, compo&s;ed of oil and water, are of a mixed nature, more approaching to water, perhaps, in its penetra|tion, and certainly in its leaving the part more dry and friable. With regard to the u&s;e of oil, it is &s;uppo&s;ed an improper Emollient, as from its tenacity it may &s;top per&s;piration; on which account it has been thought that it ought to be rejected in Surgery. All of this theory &s;eems to be un&s;ound. If &s;uch was its property in warm countries, where per&s;piration is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, it would not be much u&s;ed. I imagine, that, unle&s;s where it is &s;o thick as to dry on the &s;kin, and entangle the du&s;t in the air, and the <HI>&s;ordes</HI> of the &s;kin, it can hardly affect per&s;piration. Hence, then, the practice of the warm countries &s;hould always be taken together, unction and warm bathing. Per&s;piration flows with &s;ome force from the &s;kin, as any one may ob&s;erve, who will take the trouble to render it vi&s;ible. This velocity is &s;o great, that it would &s;eem to be ca|pable of overcoming the re&s;i&s;tance of any &s;uch fluid as oil. Nay, I have &s;uppo&s;ed that oil may excite per&s;piration, by relaxing the orifices of the ve&s;&s;els, at lea&s;t &s;ome of its effects &s;eem to &s;ay &s;o.

<P>Both for an Emollient and Demulcent, the root &s;hould not be em|ployed as recently dug up, nor, at the &s;ame time, too much dried. In the one ca&s;e it is too much diluted with water, in the other the mucilage is not ea&s;ily extracted, &s;o that an intermediate &s;tate, between both the&s;e, is to be cho&s;en, which, I imagine, is &s;eldom the ca&s;e in our &s;hops. <HI>Althaea</HI> root might be prepared in the &s;ame manner as Salep, and, in a powder of that kind, it would yield its mucilage much more ea&s;ily.</P>

<HEAD>MANNER of OPERATION.</HEAD>
<P>Here Stimulants, perhaps, may be con&s;idered as of two kinds; Fir&s;t, Tho&s;e which are indirect, <HI>i. e.</HI> which act on the organs of &s;en&s;e, by which means a perception is excited in the <HI>Sen&s;orium com|mune,</HI> which, acting there, determines the nervous power to flow more copiou&s;ly into the whole, or a particular part of the &s;y&s;tem. Secondly, Tho&s;e which are direct, <HI>i. e.</HI> becau&s;e they are imagined to act directly on the moving fibres. The indirect are the mo&s;t com|mon and univer&s;al; in&s;omuch that it has been a que&s;tion, whe|ther the direct action of Stimulants ever takes place, and whether it is not always in con&s;equence of impre&s;&s;ions on the organs of &s;en&s;e. But there is nothing more evident, than that Stimulants may excite motion in the moving fibres them&s;elves, independent of any con|nection with the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune.</HI> Thus we may &s;eparate a &s;in|gle moving fibre from the body, where there cannot be any con|nection &s;uppo&s;ed with the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune;</HI> and yet, while heat remains in it, it is capable of having a motion excited in it by Stimulants. Hence I would alledge, that when the living body is entire, that medicines may act directly on the moving fibres, be|cau&s;e in many in&s;tances, no effects on the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune</HI> are previou&s;ly evident. The metaphy&s;ical Phy&s;iologi&s;ts have &s;uppo&s;ed the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;entient principle pre&s;ent in every action; and if, &s;ometimes, there is a want of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, they &s;ay that this is de&s;troyed by repetition and habit; and, indeed, in
<PB N="234" REF="014000_0240_0F928BD3BAA8CCC8">
many in&s;tances, this &s;eems to be the ca&s;e. Thus the motions of our eyes are owing to &s;en&s;ations excited by the impre&s;&s;ions of light; but cu&s;tom has &s;o familiarized this, that motions come to be excited without our direction. But &s;urely there is no habit of emetics or purgatives, and the&s;e do not produce their effects on the &s;en&s;e till the evacuation is made; and if they are &s;ometimes attended with pain, this is not produced directly by the medicine, but by its effect, the &s;pa&s;modic contraction.</P>
<P>From the&s;e, and other con&s;iderations, we mu&s;t admit of two kinds of Stimulants. With regard to their operation, in both ca&s;es the theory is difficult. In ca&s;es of &s;en&s;ation, &s;ome kind of mechanical impul&s;e is &s;ufficiently evident; but we can hardly &s;uppo&s;e, that from this we mu&s;t deduce its effects. The motions produced, are not to be &s;o accounted for. The effects are not at all proportional to the force of impre&s;&s;ion, <HI>i. e.</HI> the force of mechanical impul&s;e. Weak impre&s;&s;ions often produce &s;trong &s;en&s;ation, and &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions oftner extend no farther than the part to which they are applied. I own it is to be wi&s;hed, and the Phy&s;iologi&s;ts are in the right to en|deavour to account for motions, as near as may be, from mechanical operation. Thus it is common to ob&s;erve, that &s;harp pointed bodies &s;timulate, and ju&s;tly, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;uch effect may be attributed to the figure, and motions thus excited may properly enough be &s;aid to be produced from mechanical &s;timulus. However, Stimu|lants are not alone &s;harp or pointed bodies. Every thing impre&s;&s;ed on the fibres, which &s;tretches them out, whether it be blunt or not, proves a Stimulus, and cau&s;es contraction. From this effect of &s;tretch|ing, joined with that of points, have Phy&s;iologi&s;ts laid down a rule, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that whatever approaches to produce a &s;olution of continuity i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Stimulus. But it is extremely difficult to prove this; and ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fibres may be put in motion by &s;uch cau&s;es as will not act in this manner. However, let us grant this for the pre&s;ent, yet it will have little effect in accounting for <HI>Stimuli;</HI> and it is as difficult as to ac|count for the tremor of the air producing &s;ound, or that of the rays of light our ideas of light. Nay, it is thought by Phy&s;iologi&s;ts.
<PB N="235" REF="014000_0241_0F928BD4DF2A60D8">
that we might have been &s;o con&s;tituted, that what now produces odour might have produced light, <HI>et contra, &amp;c.</HI> Thus you plainly &s;ee, we cannot account for &s;uch effects from a mechanical operation, and, indeed, impre&s;&s;ions on our &s;en&s;es, with regard to the ideas pro|duced, and their effects, are by no means mechanical, or explicable upon any theory we know. Even the changes made on the &s;imple fibres cannot be thus explained. The operation of cold is directly contrary to the &s;olution of continuity, for it acts by conden&s;ing or encrea&s;ing, and yet this is certainly a Stimulus. In &s;hort, we are &s;en&s;ible to every mode of motion, if &s;en&s;ible at all, and to every con|dition in which the fibres may be in.</P>
<P>Hence the difference Phy&s;icans have made between mechanical and chemical Stimuli; the fir&s;t, where the operation can be explained from the figure; the &s;econd, where it depends on the operation of &s;mall parts of bodies upon each other, from a peculiar property which we do not know. I mention all this, not for any a&s;&s;i&s;tance it will give us in our di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, but in order to avoid fooli&s;h theories. Whatever we &s;ee &s;timulates the body, we call it acrid, or &s;harp. The former term is very proper, but where we &s;ay the operation depends upon figure, we can explain nothing from it; &s;o that the Corpu&s;cularian doctrine is very frivolous. The operation of <HI>Stimuli</HI> requires a chemical theory, with which we are not yet provided; but although we cannot explain the direct operation, yet we have &s;ome ob&s;ervations to make concerning it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The operation of <HI>Stimuli</HI> is of two kinds; fir&s;t, that which is in common, or general to the &s;y&s;tem, and is liable to affect every fibre; &s;econdly, that which is confined to a particular part of the &s;y&s;tem only. Impre&s;&s;ions, made on our &s;en&s;es, give us a notion of &s;pecific <HI>Stimuli.</HI> There are plainly certain parts of the body liable to be affected with particular <HI>Stimuli,</HI> as the eye with the rays of light, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The organs of &s;en&s;e are not a&s;certained. Five principal are &s;uppo&s;ed, but many more are comprehended under the Touch&punc; All this leads us into the notion of &s;pecific <HI>Stimuli;</HI> but we are often
<PB N="236" REF="014000_0242_0F928BD530A811E8">
apt to be mi&s;taken, and conceive &s;pecifics, where there is only a common and general operation. Thus we are very apt to con&s;ider as &s;uch, tho&s;e medicines which are nece&s;&s;arily fir&s;t applied to, and obliged to act on, a particular organ. Thus every medicine which is &s;wallowed, mu&s;t fir&s;t thus nece&s;&s;arily act on the throat and &s;to|mach, but is no &s;pecific. Thus emetics are &s;ub&s;tances of con&s;ider|able acrimony, and ready &s;olution; in con&s;equence of which they &s;timulate the &s;tomach, and are thrown out before they arrive at the inte&s;tines; but we know that, if from difficult &s;olubility they do not act upon the &s;tomach, they will arrive at the inte&s;tines, and will al&s;o act upon the&s;e. We are very ready to imagine here, that there is a &s;pecific action. Many think that emetics are &s;pecifically di&s;po&s;ed to operate on the fibres of the &s;tomach, and purgatives on tho&s;e of the inte&s;tines; and it is alledged, that, when mixed with the blood, their operation is only upon the&s;e parts: But, the experiments adduced in proof of this fact are very fallacious; and it is &s;till pro|bable, that the effects of the&s;e medicines, as commonly exhibited, depend entirely on the quantity and &s;olubility of the medicine, and &s;en&s;ibility of the different parts.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is another ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, in which we may be deceived in the &s;pecific action of medicines, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> when they are carried into the blood ve&s;&s;els. Here we are very ready to call &s;uch medicine as operates more on one &s;ecretion than another, a &s;pecific. But here we are apt to be deceived from any circum&s;tances which may de|termine the operation to particular organs, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> from particular al|liances to certain <HI>men&s;trua,</HI> as, <HI>e. g.</HI> that of &s;aline &s;ub&s;tances with the watery part of the blood, by which means they go off by the kid|neys, and thus prove a <HI>Stimulus</HI> to them, without acting &s;pecifi|cally: For the&s;e very &s;ub&s;tances may al&s;o, by other means, be deter|mined to other &s;ecretions. Thus, if the pores of the &s;kin are &s;hut, the&s;e medicines will go off by the kidneys; but if by any means, as lying in bed, they are rendered open, the&s;e medicines will be de|termined to that more general excretory, the &s;kin: And it is a common ob&s;ervation, that the &s;ame medicine may be indifferently
<PB N="237" REF="014000_0243_0F928BD5DC34D728">
diuretic, diaphoretic, or pectoral; the la&s;t in &s;o far as they promote the &s;ecretion of mucus in the lungs, the rea&s;on of which effect, however is not &s;o ea&s;y to explain.</P>
<P N="3">3. Medicines have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have a &s;pecific virtue, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that they have a peculiar power of altering the texture of our blood, in&s;pi&s;&s;ating or attenuating it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by preparing a great quantity of matter for particular &s;ecretions. Thus the ope|ration of Mercury has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;pecific with regard to the &s;alivary glands. Others, however, &s;uppo&s;e that proceeds from the Mercury being more particularly a&s;&s;ociated to &s;uch parts of the blood as pa&s;s by the &s;alivary glands, and that hence it exerts its <HI>Stimulus</HI> more particularly there; which otherwi&s;e it does in common to the whole &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e are the arguments which are brought again&s;t &s;pecific <HI>Stimuli.</HI> If medicines, applied to the external part of the body, be ab&s;orbed, and then act always on a particular part, &s;uch may be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pecific. Again, if in injecting &s;ub&s;tances into the blood ve&s;&s;els, &s;uch medicines are always &s;een to exert their effects on particular parts, as, <HI>e. g.</HI> if jalap always purges, and ipeca|cuanha vomits, &s;uch may be reckoned &s;pecific, for &s;uch medicines mu&s;t be poured out promi&s;cuou&s;ly on all the glands at once, and &s;hould therefore &s;timulate them all alike. At the &s;ame time, there are &s;till difficulties to obviate the various cau&s;es, which may deter|mine the operation to peculiar parts. There are who, not con|&s;idering the&s;e difficulties, have been very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ond of &s;pecific <HI>Stimuli.</HI> Some thus have &s;uppo&s;ed different effects of different medicines acting in the nervous power, and affecting the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune.</HI> Some they have &s;uppo&s;ed acting on the organs of voluntary motions, others more particularly on the heart and blood ve&s;&s;els. Hence has ari&s;en the di&s;tinction between Cardiac and Cephalic. But I know no in&s;tance where &s;uch effects take place.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another difference of Stimulants has been made from the de|gree of force. Linnaeus's definition of Stimulants is, <HI>Stimulantia &s;ecretiones incitant.</HI> This certainly very often they do, by acting on the excretory organ. Formerly, when I talked of my divi&s;ion of
<PB N="238" REF="014000_0244_0F928BD6862D9E88">
medicines, which acted on the fluids, into the <HI>Alterantia</HI> and <HI>Eva|cuantia,</HI> I ob&s;erved that in the&s;e the medicines act on the moving fibres, and only from their more direct application to the fibres of a particular organ, excited that evacuation. Here let me add, that, taking any particular part of the body, to which a Stimulant is ap|plied, if excretory orifices be the part, their &s;ecretion will be pro|duced; and perhaps the action of the <HI>Stimulus</HI> will extend to the moving fibres of the &s;ecretory organ. If the &s;timulant externally applied acts only on the nerves of the &s;kin, it will cau&s;e a greater flow of blood to the part, and prove <HI>rubi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aciens,</HI> which is the fir&s;t appearance of inflammation; and, if the <HI>Stimulus</HI> be &s;trong, inflam|mation it&s;elf; and if in a certain degree of inflammation the <HI>rete muco&s;um</HI> be affected, rai&s;e bli&s;ters, and perhaps gangrene. The&s;e effects have given occa&s;ion to a particular term applied, <HI>Epi&s;pa&s;tica,</HI> in Latin <HI>Attrahentia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>None of the manu&s;cripts we have &s;een make any tolerable &s;en&s;e of the following paragraph, and it &s;hould therefore, perhaps, be left out altogether; but we &s;hall venture to give here what we conceive to be the Doctor's &s;en&s;e of this matter.</HI></P>
<P>Ab&s;tracting from the effects of the increa&s;ed action of the moving fibres upon the motion of the fluids, we think it proper here to con|&s;ider more &s;imply the effects of &s;timulants on the moving fibres them&s;elves. The&s;e are, in general, the increa&s;ing the influx, or ex|citing the action of the nervous power in the fibres; and this, ac|cording to the different degrees of force in the &s;timulus, may be in different &s;tates; as, 1. An increa&s;e of tone only. 2. Involuntary and convul&s;ive action. And, 3. Spa&s;modic contraction. The tone or con&s;tant tendency to contraction which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the moving fibres of living bodies under any degree of exten&s;ion, is partly owing to the ela&s;ticity of the &s;imple &s;olid, but more con&s;iderably to the con|&s;tant energy of the brain, in determining the nervous power into the moving fibres; and it is owing to the various &s;tates of this energy of the brain, that we ob&s;erve &s;uch &s;udden vici&s;&s;itudes of debility and &s;trength in the moving fibres of whole body. Hence, &s;timulants applied to any part, often have their action communicated to the &s;en|&s;orium,
<PB N="239" REF="014000_0245_0F928BD75847CA30">
and may increa&s;e the energy of the brain &s;o much, as to increa&s;e the tone of the moving fibres over the whole &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e &s;timulants, therefore, may be employed as tonics, but &s;eldom with conveniency, as they are apt to increa&s;e too much the action of the&s;e parts, which are otherwi&s;e expo&s;ed to a con&s;tant &s;timulus. Such is the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem; and, as the inflammatory diathe&s;is con&s;i&s;ts in the increa&s;ed tone of the heart and arteries, our &s;timulants are very apt to induce or increa&s;e this diathe&s;is. However difficult it may &s;eem to di&s;tingui&s;h between the tonic effects of a&s;tringent, &s;e|dative, and &s;timulant medicines; it is certain that the &s;timulants are more remarkable than the others for their inflammatory powers, and are therefore, upon many occa&s;ions, inconvenient. The influx of nervous power capable of giving tone, we &s;uppo&s;e to be in a le&s;s degree than is nece&s;&s;ary to excite contraction, and it is only when the &s;timulus is &s;tronger, that contractions are produced. In the&s;e it is ob&s;erved, that they are not naturally of long continuance, but are nece&s;&s;arily &s;ucceeded by a relaxation; and &s;o far is this a law of the &s;y&s;tem, that, in many ca&s;es, tho' a &s;timulus is con&s;tantly applied, it does not produce a con&s;tant contraction, but a number of contractions alternating with relaxations. In this ca&s;e, the motions are called convul&s;ions. The motions appearing in this &s;hape depend probably on the force of the &s;timulus, and the degree of contraction pro|duced; for there is a contraction of mu&s;cles which does not alternate with relaxation. It is what modern Phy&s;icians more &s;trictly call a &s;pa&s;in; and, as the contraction is not only more permanent, but ap|pears al&s;o to be in a more con&s;iderable degree, we think it may be con&s;idered as the effect of a &s;tronger &s;timulus. From the whole, it appears, that the effects of &s;timulants, as operating on the moving fibres only, are, increa&s;ing tone, exciting convul&s;ions, or producing &s;pa&s;m; and that the&s;e will ari&s;e according to the degree of force in the &s;timulus and the irritability of the parts taken together.</P>

and kind. Some are di&s;po&s;ed to affect di&s;tant parts, but tho&s;e very &s;lightly. Thus a pimple on the knee affects, as has been ob&s;erved, the oppo&s;ite &s;houlder; and I my&s;elf, if a dog with his tongue a little rough licks my hand, feel an unea&s;y tickling in the &s;oles of my feet. The difference in the effects of <HI>Stimuli</HI> in the parts to which they are applied &s;eems to depend on arbitrary laws of the animal oeconomy. Thus &s;neezing is produced from tickling the no&s;e, coughing from any part of the <HI>trachaea, &amp;c.</HI> People here may talk of con&s;ent of nerves, but this will not an&s;wer to explain the effect. From the&s;e in&s;tances, we can only ob&s;erve, that the effects of <HI>Stimuli</HI> may be &s;trangely diver&s;ified. I entered upon all this, chiefly for this ob&s;ervation, that many, and perhaps mo&s;t me|dicines act on the &s;tomach, and, in con&s;equence of their <HI>Stimulus</HI> there, propagate their effects over the &s;y&s;tem. It is no objection to this, that we are not able to explain the method of their action, on the&s;e di&s;tant parts. The action of Stimulants are very much re|gulated by habit and cu&s;tom; in &s;o far as they act on the organs of &s;en&s;e, repetition dimini&s;hes the force of the impre&s;&s;ion; &s;o that to produce the &s;ame effect after a &s;hort time, a greater impre&s;&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary, and an increa&s;ed do&s;e to produce the &s;ame effect. A dif|ference here occurs in practice, which we do not know very well to di&s;tingui&s;h in theory. There is a difference in the action of <HI>Stimuli</HI> in producing motion or &s;en&s;ation. Wherever <HI>motions</HI> are excited by <HI>Stimuli,</HI> repetition renders them more ea&s;ily &s;o, and upon &s;lighter cau&s;es; but <HI>Sen&s;ations</HI> again upon repetition, are rendered more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light.

<HEAD>CONTRA INDICATIONS of STIMULANTS in the SAN|GUIFEROUS SYSTEM.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. As in ca&s;es of languid motion Stimulants were indicated, &s;o in ca&s;es of increa&s;ed motion the&s;e are improper. There is no doubt of this, where Haemorrhage, Inflammation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> depend on an increa&s;ed <HI>impetus</HI> of the fluids, and in every <HI>diathe&s;is</HI> where there is a tendency to the&s;e. In the ca&s;e of Fever, this contra-indication is more com|plex. Wherever the Fever is in an inflammatory &s;tate, Stimulants are hurtful.</P>
<P>Wherever Fever is accompanied with languor and weakne&s;s, Sti|mulants are u&s;eful; but we are not to exhibit them in all ca&s;es where the pul&s;e &s;inks, for that is often attended with inflammation; but where the di&s;ea&s;e manife&s;tly appears without inflammation, and where its long continuance has weakened the patient, then Stimulants may be u&s;eful. In general, Stimulants are improper in the beginning of Fevers, and, in the end, allowable.</P>
<P N="2">2. Stimulants are forbid in all Ob&s;tructions, which, though attend|ed with <HI>inertia,</HI> yet from the nature, duration, and degree of the
<PB N="244" REF="014000_0250_0F928BE022EA3B80">
Ob&s;truction, we know that it is not to be overcome by &s;uddenly in|crea&s;ing the <HI>impetus</HI> of the blood, but that, by this means, we are in danger of fixing it more, or even of de&s;troying the &s;tructure of the part. If Stimulants, here, be &s;lowly thrown in, they, however, may be u&s;eful; but here the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary means are relaxing the &s;pa&s;ms, and di&s;&s;olving the fluids.</P>
<P N="3">3. Stimulants, wherever the &s;olids are over-&s;tretched, or wherever, from other cau&s;es, they are rendered tender and friable, <HI>rupturae proxima,</HI> as it is called, are contra-indicated. This they are in all ca&s;es where the fluids are remarkably thin and acrid. Here I have in view two ca&s;es, Cachexy and Scurvy. By the former, if Phy&s;i|cians mean any thing at all, they generally mean ob&s;tructions in the lower belly, where, in many ca&s;es, Stimulants would rather have the effect of fixing the Ob&s;truction, and de&s;troying the part, from tearing the &s;olids already over-&s;tretched, and rendered friable by acrimony. This gives a caution to what we &s;aid of the u&s;e of Stimulants formerly in Cachexy. In the Scurvy, where the fluids are &s;o acrid as to have eroded the ve&s;&s;els, are poured out, and have cau&s;ed Ob&s;tructions, Stimulants are entirely hurtful. We do, indeed, &s;ometimes u&s;e Sti|mulants in this di&s;ea&s;e, but they are of &s;uch nature as only to pro|mote &s;ome excretions, without producing motions, and extending their effects over the whole of the &s;y&s;tem. In general, I may ob|&s;erve, that I do not extend what I have &s;aid on the &s;ubject of the contra-indication of Stimulants, to their effects on the &s;ecretions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>REMARKS with regard to the USE of STIMULANTS.</HEAD>
<P>The frequent u&s;e of Stimulants de&s;troys the tone of the moving fibres, and dimini&s;hes the mobility of the nervous fluid. Whatever may be in this la&s;t effect, there is one ob&s;ervation which &s;erves to con|firm the fir&s;t; Nature &s;eems to have adapted our organs to the reli&s;h of the mild and bland, for &s;uch are the &s;ub&s;tances we employ in food, and univer&s;ally has &s;he given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s an aver&s;ion to the poignant and &s;timu|lant. With regard to the mild and bland, with them no per&s;on is naturally palled, but there are always in&s;tances, through the whole of life, of per&s;ons entertaining an aver&s;ion for the &s;timulant. Me|dicines
<PB N="245" REF="014000_0251_0F928BE313B9AAD8">
are di&s;tingui&s;hed as active, acrid &s;ub&s;tances, and an aver&s;ion to &s;uch is univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed, and therefore Stimulants are &s;uited to the body as medicines, but, in the main, they are hurtful to the &s;y&s;tem, and tend to de&s;troy its tone. Hence, then, we &s;hould avoid Stimulants as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ince, &s;o produce their fir&s;t effect, they always require a &s;tronger and &s;tronger do&s;e; &s;o that, at la&s;t, &s;o much is nece&s;&s;ary as will de&s;troy the tone of the &s;tomach, and that of the whole &s;y&s;tem. In the fir&s;t part of life, Nature has wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ely given us mo&s;t aver&s;ion to the&s;e, as then they would be mo&s;t hurtful, and, before the natural duration of life was at an end, would require to be given in &s;uch quantity as would totally de&s;troy us; in the latter part of life we come to reli&s;h them m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re, as then the time we have to live is &s;horter, and, con&s;equently, the danger le&s;s.</P>
<P>As to their u&s;e, therefore, in general, we ought, wherever they are nece&s;&s;ary, to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gin with &s;mall do&s;es; &s;o that if a long continuance of them is nece&s;&s;ary, we may increa&s;e the do&s;e without danger. What|ever di&s;ea&s;e requires Stimulants, we at fir&s;t reap good effects from them, but afterwards, from habit, the&s;e effects are de&s;troyed. Hence, then, when we can, we ought frequently to interrupt their exhibition, in order to interrupt the habit by which their effects are lo&s;t. Nothing is more common than Phy&s;icians pre&s;cribing a medi|cine for years, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but certainly it would be much better to order an intermi&s;&s;ion, and perhaps by this means we &s;hould attain our pur|po&s;e better at the la&s;t, and be&s;ides could frequently recur to the &s;ame cour&s;e with advantage.</P>
<P>There is, however, one exception to this rule of beginning with &s;mall do&s;es, and that is, wherever a &s;udden effect is to be produced. This I have frequently &s;een in the u&s;e of Opiates; where con&s;idera|ble effects might have been certainly obtained by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ull do&s;e at fir&s;t, which could not be attained by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mall ones frequently repeated and encrea&s;ed. This exception mo&s;t generally takes place with regard to Stimulants, which act as anti&s;pa&s;modic.</P>
<P>The principal purpo&s;es of Stimulants have been now marked out, but the&s;e effects are &s;eldom obtained by the Stimulants, we are to

Hence the u&s;e of Stimu|lants has declined of late, and does &s;o daily, and many are marked in our Catalogue, which are di&s;regarded in practice, and known only in our Di&s;pen&s;atory li&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD>FOUNDATION of STIMULANT VIRTUE in SENSIBLE QUALITIES.</HEAD>
<P>In general, a Stimulant virtue is di&s;covered by a &s;trong ta&s;te, and odour; and all &s;ub&s;tances, which make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on our &s;en&s;es, may be con&s;idered as &s;uch. It is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h them all here; as &s;ome of the&s;e may be &s;edative, and &s;ome anti&s;pa&s;modic; but even th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e have always more or le&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;timulant virtue.

<HEAD>What PART the STIMULANT VIRTUE is lodged.</HEAD>
<P>Very univer&s;ally in the e&s;&s;ential oil of plants. The &s;aline part of plants is not remarkably &s;timulant. Wherever, therefore, we have means of di&s;covering e&s;&s;ential oil, we al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure have the power of judging of a &s;timulant virtue.

We mu&s;t not imagine, that becau&s;e a plant gives out an e&s;&s;ential oil by di&s;tillation, that the&s;e plants are &s;timulant; for many &s;uch are of a very mild nature. Again, &s;ub&s;tances acrid to the ta&s;te give out a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld oil; as that of Cloves, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nce the acrimony would &s;eem not always to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the e&s;&s;ential oil.

Acrimony often &s;eems to be lodged in a gummy matter, &s;oluble in water. The acrid part is &s;aid to be extremely volatile, and not to be obtained in the form of e&s;&s;ential oil; as in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>Siliquo&s;ae,</HI> Mu&s;tard, and others of the Cre&s;s kind; in which it is &s;uppo&s;ed the acrimony is not lodged in the e&s;&s;ential oil, but in a &s;ubtile volatile part diffu&s;ible, in water. But I find that, on proper examination, an e&s;&s;ential oil may be obtained from the&s;e, containing all their acrimony; and I am inclined to be|lieve their acrimony is lodged in an e&s;&s;ential oil; though that be ex|tremely volat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure mixed with water.

<P>Mo&s;t properly, and very univer&s;ally, are our acrid Stimulants to be extracted by alcohol.

<P>There is a very common preparation in the &s;hops, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> an impreg|nation of water with e&s;&s;ential oil, in what is called di&s;tilled waters.

All this would lead us to u&s;e our Simulants in &s;ub&s;tance, &s;ince we find there is in the plant a virtue not to be procured by any extract, and, in many ca&s;es, we can make a better &s;olution in our &s;tomach than any where el&s;e. With regard to u&s;ing the Stimulants in &s;ub&s;tance, we mu&s;t be aware of the method of preparing them; for, in drying and powdering, the volatile part, and, with it, the virtues are often lo&s;t; &s;o that, indeed, it &s;eems to be a doubt whether &s;timulants &s;hould be exhibited in this manner.

It is a mild Sternutatory, and, as &s;uch, will be mentioned in the cla&s;s of Errhines. It has been &s;aid to to be hypnotic and anodyne, by Pauli; and, by better authority, Bartholine. Not any &s;uch virtue appears in the bark, or leaves. The root is an acrid, emetic &s;ub&s;tance, and perhaps may contain virtues of &s;ome con&s;equence. The <HI>Veronica</HI> is joined by Cartheu&s;er in the &s;ame &s;ection with Betony, though of a different natural order, and &s;en&s;ible qualities. Perhaps he was led

The Coriander &s;eeds are agreeably aromatic, but come from a plant foetid, and &s;u&s;|pected of poi&s;onous qualities.

<PB N="255" REF="014000_0261_0F928BEE3B5B01E0">
of the <HI>Umbellatae</HI> are what are chiefly known in medicine. The&s;e have all one common virtue. They are all in the common language carminative, <HI>i. e.</HI> anti&s;pa&s;modic in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ting dige&s;tion, relieving head-achs ari&s;ing from crudity, di&s;pelling flatulencies, and curing cholics. The&s;e virtues are certainly real, depending on an e&s;&s;ential oil manife&s;t in all the&s;e plants, which is remarkably aro|matic, with little acrimony, and with little &s;u&s;picion of being of an inflammatory nature, and are, therefore, the &s;afe&s;t of the <HI>aromata</HI> we can u&s;e in the&s;e intentions. As natives of Europe, they &s;eem intended by nature for the&s;e cold climates, where there is &s;o great a tendency to Inflammation.

Spirits, and weak punch, are often very improperly employed by the nur&s;es. Ani&s;e &s;eeds are very effectual for the purpo&s;e, as they act in an incon&s;iderable &s;mall do&s;e, and therefore are &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, either as they are not in hazard of inducing bad habits, or &s;timulating too much. The&s;e are their real virtues. Many others are attributed to them. They are &s;aid to increa&s;e the milk of nur&s;es. They do, indeed, come off unchanged in it, and &s;ometimes, by condi|ment of this kind, given to the nur&s;es, I have &s;een them &s;o far con|veyed to children, who laboured under Cholics (either from their natural di&s;po&s;ition, or from the nature of the milk) as to obviate entirely the&s;e complaints. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that as they pa&s;s un|changed, they may &s;timulate the excretories, and give milk; but for my part, I think this is injudiciou&s;ly attempted, by any thing but proper nouri&s;hment, and if this fails, the complaint lies too deep for any medicine, by &s;timulating the excretories, to have effect. They are &s;aid to be diuretic, and the <HI>Daucus &s;ylve&s;tris</HI> has been employed for this effect; but I could never, even in con&s;iderable do&s;es, ob&s;erve its diuretic virtues.

Many others of the &s;ame cla&s;s are &s;aid to be diuretic.

The &s;hare the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances have in aliment, I have formerly mentioned. As Medicines, they act &s;uddenly and powerfully, and their <HI>Stimulus</HI> is quickly diffu&s;ed, &s;o that they are u&s;eful in all tho&s;e ca&s;es where the motion of the nervous power is languid, weak, or ob&s;tructed, as in paralytic and apoplectic ca&s;es; where I have found no <HI>Stimulus</HI> better (as I formerly ob&s;erved) than a little Mu&s;tard. Habit wears off the&s;e effects, and I have frequently &s;een Hor&s;e-radi&s;h, when Mu&s;tard failed, &s;ub&s;tituted with advantage. U&s;ed internally for any length of time, their effects, through habit, come to be trivial. Ex|ternally they are u&s;ed with better effect, as we can increa&s;e their power, by increa&s;ing the &s;urface to which they are applied; but it is difficult to get it with its proper qualities in that powdery form, which is here nece&s;&s;ary. They have likewi&s;e an inconvenience, that, retained long on the &s;kin, they are apt to be inflammatory, which is not near &s;o u&s;eful as their fir&s;t exten&s;ive impre&s;&s;ion. In mo&s;t ca&s;es we &s;hould &s;eek for the fir&s;t operation, and avoid the la&s;t. As con|fined to a particular part in their action, we &s;hall talk of them under the head of <HI>Attrahentia.</HI> They prove particular <HI>Stimuli,</HI> not from any &s;pecific virtue, but according to the place to which they are applied. Thus, in the &s;tomach, while they act as promoting di|ge&s;tion in general, and as carminative in di&s;pelling crudities, if &s;trong they will prove emetic, Accordingly Mu&s;tard and Hor&s;e-radi&s;h are employed as gentle emetics, as they are &s;ub&s;tances thrown up at fir&s;t, and without continuing their effects. When the &s;tomach is once &s;et in motion, the vomiting, if that be found nece&s;&s;ary, may be continued by repeated draughts of warm water, or with &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Stimuli</HI> in it. The be&s;t method of exhibiting Mu&s;tard, as a vomit, is, fir&s;t to give a table &s;poonful of it, diffu&s;ed in a gla&s;s of
<PB N="258" REF="014000_0264_0F928BF01D2D0650">
warm water, and afterwards, to add a little Mu&s;tard to every &s;ub|&s;equent draught. Others are fond of Hor&s;e-radi&s;h in a &s;trong in|fu&s;ion, of which a &s;poonful is given in warm water. In my opinion the mu&s;tard is preferable; for the Hor&s;e-radi&s;h, as very volatile, lo&s;es its virtue, when kept, and, even in infu&s;ion, is liable to the &s;ame inconvenience, except that is performed in very clo&s;e ve&s;&s;els; nor when the infu&s;ion is obtained, can it produce the effects pro|po&s;ed without large and nau&s;eous draughts frequently repeated. If the emetic virtue of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances does not take place, they are carried into the inte&s;tines, which they &s;timulate, and promote the evacuation by &s;tool. In order to obtain the purgative effect, the &s;eed is given entire; <HI>i. e.</HI> in the Mu&s;tard, commonly in the do&s;e of a table &s;poonful. Of the &s;ame &s;eed powdered we could not give one drachm, without vomiting, whereas I have &s;een even two table &s;poonfuls unbrui&s;ed, which is one ounce, given without that effect. In this manner, Mu&s;tard &s;eldom fails to move the belly, and an&s;wers very well for keeping a co&s;tive habit regular. Its effect in this ca&s;e is difficult to explain. We can only &s;uppo&s;e, that it is not extracted in &s;ufficient quantity in the &s;tomach to act as emetic, but is carried into the inte&s;tines, who&s;e contents it &s;timulates them to di&s;charge, in con&s;equence of its quantity and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive action. Upon the &s;ame footing it may go farther into the &s;y&s;tem, before it has exerted any <HI>Stimulus</HI> &s;ufficient to throw it out of the body. If given entire in &s;uch quantity as neither to vomit nor purge, it will enter into the blood ve&s;&s;els, where it is directed to the kidneys, and &s;hews diu|retic powers. All diuretics, by proper management, may be ren|dered diaphoretic. If the &s;urface is kept warm, the medicine goes off by the &s;kin; if it is cool, an increa&s;e of urine is effected, and the medicine is determined to act upon the kidneys. In this manner &s;ome of the <HI>Siliquo&s;ae</HI> have been employed as &s;udorific, and a Mu&s;tard-whey has been given for this purpo&s;e.

As this cla&s;s, then, are u&s;ed in food, as they can be taken in con&s;iderable quantity, and as they are likewi&s;e proper as medicine, they are, with|out doubt, peculiarly adapted to this intention. As diuretic and dia|phoretic, it is probably not without rea&s;on they are called pectoral. Something &s;eems to be in common with the &s;urface of the lungs and the &s;kin; and Dr. Hales has &s;hewn, that a good deal of what we call in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, goes off by that organ. As then the kid|neys have an intimate connection with the &s;urface of the body, and as that again is connected with the lungs, it is probable that medi|cines which &s;timulate the kidneys and &s;kin will likewi&s;e have effect upon the lungs, by cau&s;ing &s;ecretion from their &s;urface. Altho' it is difficult to explain, they &s;eem to have a power of &s;timulating the mucous glands of the lungs, and it is probable, that in this way they are &s;o often u&s;eful in di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t. Externally applied to the excretory ducts of the&s;e glands, they &s;timulate them, and hence are &s;o often mentioned as curing hoar&s;ene&s;s. <HI>Eruca</HI> and <HI>Ery&s;imum,</HI> when fre&s;h, are famous for this u&s;e. In producing this effect, they are &s;aid to add more than natural clearne&s;s to the voice: Whence, in French, one of them is called <HI>Herbe aux Chantres.</HI> The method of u&s;ing them is to make them into a &s;yrup, a &s;mall quantity of which is laid on the tongue, and &s;wallowed &s;lowly, by which means they come to be applied to the mucous glands of the <HI>Fauces,</HI> whence we may &s;uppo&s;e their action extended to the <HI>Bronchiae.</HI> The&s;e virtues I have had confirmed by experience, but have not confined my&s;elf to the <HI>Eruca</HI> or <HI>Ery&s;imum,</HI> but have u&s;ed the Hor&s;e-radi&s;h with the &s;ame advantage. The&s;e are the common virtues of the order. The particular &s;pecies of this order only differ in degree of virtue, that is, in proportion as they have their acrimony more o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in compari&s;on to the other parts.

in point of &s;trength, it does not appear to be properly determined by experiment. We &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the Mu&s;tard, as a &s;eed, the Hor&s;e-radi&s;h, as a root, and the Scurvy-gra&s;s, as a plant, are probably the &s;tronge&s;t of the kind, and tho&s;e we are be&s;t acquainted with.</P>
<P>The virtue of the&s;e Stimulants (as of mo&s;t other cla&s;&s;es) are not accompanied with other qualities, Bitterne&s;s, A&s;tringency, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Siliquo&s;ae</HI> have indeed a bitterne&s;s in common to the whole cla&s;s, from their peculiar acrimony. Some, however, are &s;aid to be a&s;tringent. The <HI>Bur&s;a pa&s;toris</HI> has been &s;aid to be &s;o, but, upon trial, I have found no &s;uch qualities in it. The virtue of the <HI>Siliquo&s;ae</HI> is not only more in common, but more equally diffu&s;ed over the plant, than in any order I know. If there is any di&s;tinction to be made, I think the &s;tronge&s;t acrimony is lodged in the &s;eeds, the next &s;tronge&s;t in the roots, and the weake&s;t in the leaves. Hence the&s;e la&s;t are the mo&s;t proper Anti&s;corbutics, as they can be thrown in both as a food and as a medicine, in the greate&s;t quantity. The virtue of all the&s;e re&s;ides in a very volatile &s;ub&s;tance, for it is di&s;&s;ipated in drying. When fre&s;h, this volatile principle comes over from the plant, in di&s;tillation with water. Hence it has been &s;uppo&s;ed of a &s;aline na|ture, but more accurate enquiry now &s;hews us, that it re&s;ides in an e&s;&s;ential oil of this peculiar property, that, though extremely volatile, it is yet &s;pecifically heavier than water. It remains (for I have not tried it) to enquire whether this oil has the &s;ame volatility when &s;e|parate, as in the plant. It mu&s;t not only be &s;topped with common &s;toppers, but kept with water under ground. It may be a &s;ubtle &s;pi|ritus rector, a &s;maller portion of the oil that is thus di&s;po&s;ed to fly off. With this acrid, volatile, e&s;&s;ential oil, the&s;e plants &s;hew they al&s;o contain an expre&s;&s;ed oil, which is not only a curious fact in che|mi&s;try, but al&s;o in the anatomy of the plant, and which we &s;hould not have expected <HI>&agrave; priori.</HI> The&s;e two oils are lodged in different parts of the &s;eed, otherwi&s;e, on expre&s;&s;ion, a part of the e&s;&s;ential oil would always come away with the expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="014000_0267_0F928BF24A1E58E8">
As to the exhibition of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, they always ought to be given in &s;ub&s;tance entire, e&s;pecially in the Scurvy, in order that we may give a vegetable aliment along with our medicine, without which the Scurvy cannot be cured. The e&s;&s;ential oil of the plant, though diuretic, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would not an&s;wer, unle&s;s al&s;o the expre&s;&s;ed oil were joined with it, in the entire &s;tate, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in affording the aliment we &s;poke of; and I am per&s;uaded, that though the e&s;&s;en|tial oil were never &s;o well extracted and pre&s;erved, it could never cure the Scurvy. Though this be really the ca&s;e, yet if the e&s;&s;en|tial oil could be extracted at a moderate expence, or give a &s;trong impregnation to &s;pirit, it might &s;erve for other purpo&s;es in which the&s;e medicines were recommended, e&s;pecially in paralytic ca&s;es. In the mean time, we know no other preparation but the &s;yrup, which an&s;wers not only for hoar&s;ene&s;s, but in paralytic ca&s;es, and, as I have &s;een, in pectoral. In making this, we &s;hould confine our|&s;elves to the &s;eeds and roots. Hor&s;e-radi&s;h is the mo&s;t fit of any. This is not &s;o &s;ucculent as that it can be extracted by expre&s;&s;ion. As a very volatile &s;ubject, it &s;hould be taken fre&s;h, &s;craped down quickly, and let fall into water, to prevent the effects of air, then &s;hut up in clo&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and &s;et in balneo, and, after &s;tanding there for &s;ome time, be taken out, and expre&s;&s;ed upon a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;ugar, with which it may be again committed to the bath, with the &s;ame precautions, and afterwards corked up in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, in order that, when it is opened, it may be quickly con&s;umed, and have as little of the bad effects from the air as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<HEAD>ALLIACIAE.</HEAD>
<P>Though of a very different botanical tribe, I have &s;et the&s;e down immediately after the <HI>Siliquo&s;ae,</HI> as agreeing with them very much in medicinal virtues and chemical qualities. Even in &s;en&s;ible qualities there is a re&s;emblance, and one of the <HI>Siliquo&s;ae</HI> is called <HI>Alliacia,</HI> from its alliaceous odour. The <HI>Alliacia</HI> and <HI>Siliquo&s;ae</HI> agree, too, in having their virtue re&s;iding in a volatile principle, and in having that volatile principle re&s;iding in an e&s;&s;ential oil, which &s;inks in
<PB N="262" REF="014000_0268_0F928BF2F593CA30">
water. The only difference is, that the <HI>Alliaciae</HI> contain more of a mucilaginous matter, which, when their acrimony is di&s;&s;ipated by boiling, &s;hews more of a nutritious, and, if you will, demulcent quality. Neither, indeed, is their acrimony &s;o volatile, or &s;o im|mediately active as that of the former cla&s;s, nor &s;o exten&s;ive in the propagation of their &s;timulus, if they are equally acrid. Hence they are not &s;o frequently employed in paralytic ca&s;es; but, bating the&s;e differences, their diuretic, diaphoretic, and pectoral qua|lities, &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing as tho&s;e of the <HI>Siliquo&s;ae.</HI> There is, too, a farther analogy, that, if exhibited in the &s;ame manner, they are apt to affect the &s;tomach with pain and vomiting. If intended to be conveyed into the ma&s;s of blood, they ought to be exhibited in their entire texture. Thus the cloves of Garlic ought to be dipped in oil, and &s;wallowed entire, for the common Garlic pill will &s;eldom prove diuretic. Sometimes, indeed, that pill grows pectoral, but never &s;o con&s;iderably as in the other manner. The Syrup of Garlic is the only preparation which is a good one; and proper directions for it may be &s;een in the London Di&s;pen&s;atory. The Garlic, like Mu&s;tard, will act as an external &s;timulus, and, ex|cept from its di&s;agreeable odour, an&s;wers equally, and may likewi&s;e be very properly applied to the extremities in low fever. The Gar|lic is not &s;o liable to ulcerate the part, but is more apt to be ab&s;orbed and to extend its effects to di&s;tant parts. Some &s;ay, that this is pectoral externally applied, but I have never been able to ob&s;erve this effect.</P>
<P>As to any difference in the <HI>Alliaciae,</HI> it is only a difference in im|pregnation and &s;trength.

<HEAD>6. BALSAMICA.</HEAD>
<P>The title of Bal&s;am has been applied to oily or re&s;inous bodies of a middle con&s;i&s;tence, betwixt oil and re&s;in. The&s;e are commonly obtained from the <HI>Coniferae,</HI> and all approach to the nature of our Turpentine. Of Turpentine, and the four Bal&s;ams that follow, I am apt to think the virtues very much in common, and nearly the &s;ame in all. All have manife&s;tly the power of &s;timulating the inte&s;tines, whether thrown in by injection into the <HI>anus,</HI> or &s;wallowed by the mouth. Hence the Peruvian Bal&s;am has been recommended in that dry belly-ach, which is called the <HI>Colica Pictonum.</HI> We know the daily u&s;e of Turpentine in cly&s;ters, and, indeed, in my opinion, it is one of the be&s;t &s;ub&s;tances we u&s;e for that purpo&s;e. Wherever there is an ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, Turpentine an&s;wers much better than &s;aline matters; not that it is a &s;tronger &s;timulus, but that it is more durable, and more certain, remaining longer than the &s;alts, which are &s;oon thrown out, from their &s;timulus. The Turpentine, too, is much better than acrid purgatives, which often increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e. This
<PB N="264" REF="014000_0270_0F928BF4833BC628">
effect is not peculiar to the Turpentine, but al&s;o exi&s;ts in greater per|fection in the <HI>Bal&s;am Copaibae.</HI> Guiac, too, has been u&s;ed as a pur|gative, and I make no doubt but the Bal&s;ams of Gilead and Tolu would act in the &s;ame manner. All carried farther, &s;eemingly into the ma&s;s of blood, are diuretic, diaphoretic, and pectoral, perhaps on the ordinary footing of &s;timulating excretions, which have &s;o much in common. More e&s;pecially do we ob&s;erve their diuretic effects, in &s;o far as we can perceive them pa&s;&s;ing off in &s;ub&s;tance, by the urinary excretion. Turpentine, and the other Bal&s;ams, give what is called a violet odour to the urine; but &s;everal times have I found it the &s;ame as that of Turpentine it&s;elf. Fuller tells us, that <HI>Bal&s;am Copaibae</HI> gives a bitterne&s;s to the urine; but on having this tried, I did not find any &s;uch effect, but ju&s;t the &s;ame as is given by other Bal&s;ams.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances contain &s;omewhat &s;aline, re&s;embling much &s;uch an acid &s;ub&s;tance, as is got from Benzoine. Such a &s;aline matter I have &s;een concreted in oil of Turpentine, Which &s;ome have &s;aid they extracted by it&s;elf, and the &s;ame thing is ob&s;ervable in Pe|ruvian Bal&s;am. Po&s;&s;ibly their diuretic virtues may depend upon this Salt, and all of them contain an acid of the &s;ame kind. Con&s;tantly, by <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers, have they been recommended in the <HI>Ne|phritis,</HI> but the propriety of the exhibition here is very doubtful; as the&s;e ca&s;es are generally attended with an inflammation, which would be rendered wor&s;e by <HI>&s;timuli.</HI> Surely if &s;and is impacted in the <HI>tubuli uriniferi,</HI> or ureters, we mu&s;t u&s;e anti&s;pa&s;modics and re|laxants; for in &s;uch ca&s;es the u&s;e of <HI>&s;timuli</HI> would be very danger|ous. If it be confirmed, that the <HI>Uva Ur&s;i,</HI> and other a&s;tringents, have &s;uch good effects in di&s;ea&s;es of the kidneys, we may very &s;afely &s;ay with Ovid, <HI>Parce, puer, &s;timulis, &amp; fortius utere loris.</HI> I my&s;elf have &s;een the bad effects of Stimulants in &s;uch ca&s;es, in producing inflammation in the neck of the bladder.

<PB N="265" REF="014000_0271_0F928BF56577A108">
in gleets; and as they affect the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, &s;o they do what is contiguous to them, the uterine, and have therefore al&s;o been recom|mended in <HI>fluor albus.</HI> Their effects in &s;uch ca&s;es are confirmed by experience. It is difficult to explain how they act. They do not act by their a&s;tringency; for they po&s;&s;e&s;s no &s;uch property. They are &s;aid to have an agglutinant quality, and from this is their operation explained in wounds, and ulcers. Even in &s;uch ca&s;e they do not act from &s;uch pretended quality; and although it &s;hould be granted they did, yet we can never &s;uppo&s;e they act in the &s;ame man|ner in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages; nay, the &s;ame virtue re&s;ides in the oil, and other Stimulants have the &s;ame effect. I have &s;een <HI>Cantharides</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ure both the <HI>fluor albus</HI> and gleet, and nothing but its very acrid qualities, and the uncertainty of its action upon different people, hinders, in &s;uch ca&s;es, its more frequent u&s;e. From this view, I think there is no &s;ort of doubt, but that our Bal&s;ams act in &s;uch ca&s;es, by bringing an inflammation on the lax ve&s;&s;els, inducing in them contraction and firmne&s;s. Several accidents tend to illu&s;trate the &s;ame theory. I have &s;een per&s;ons cured of an ob&s;tinate gleet by long journeys, and riding po&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Injections of Calomel I have &s;een given in &s;uch quantity as to produce an inflammation, which it was nece&s;&s;ary to calm by repeated bleedings, but it was with the good con&s;equence of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the gleet. Corro&s;ive Sublimate I have &s;een produce bloody urine, but at the &s;ame time cure the patient; and &s;omething al&s;o of the &s;ame kind I have &s;een occur from <HI>Bal&s;. Copaibae.</HI> All this ought to make us cautious in the u&s;e of tho&s;e medicines; as it is very difficult to mea&s;ure the inflammation, and proportion the do&s;e to what degree of it we would produce.</P>
<P>As to the pectoral virtue of the Bal&s;ams we are &s;peaking of, it mu&s;t be admitted on the &s;ame footing as that of other Stimulants. In &s;ome a&s;thmas without fever, where the excretion of mucus is &s;topped by &s;pa&s;modic affections, our Bal&s;ams may promote that excretion by their anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue. Their u&s;e mu&s;t not be promi&s;cuous. The&s;e, and the Bal&s;ams of Sulphur, were formerly employed in all di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t, and even in ulceration of the
<PB N="266" REF="014000_0272_0F928BFDA8FD1E48">
lungs, but as producing that inflammation, which is in &s;uch a ca&s;e &s;o dangerous, they are now in &s;uch intention properly laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>With regard to the diaphoretic virtue, they have it in &s;o far as they are diuretic; but though they are diaphoretic by &s;timulating the excretions, yet they al&s;o &s;eem to be &s;o by acting on the &s;tomach. I have &s;een Guaiacum exert this property before it entered the in|te&s;tines; and Oil of Turpentine before exerting its diuretic quality, which, however, afterwards it did. The diaphoretic virtue of the&s;e Bal&s;ams &s;eems the foundation of their u&s;e in the Sciatica, in which di&s;ea&s;e Pitcairn gave Oil of Turpentine, in do&s;es of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In another copy the do&s;es expre&s;&s;ed are from one to two drachms, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be nearer the truth.</NOTE> four drachms, or two drachms, with &s;ucce&s;s. For my part, I never could come up to this do&s;e; from the heat and unea&s;ine&s;s produced in the &s;tomach. Sometimes, however, even in the &s;mall do&s;es in which I could exhibit it, I have &s;een good effects in Lumbagos and Sciaticas; but as often have I given it without any relief, and have &s;ometimes &s;een inflam|mation occa&s;ioned by it. On the &s;ame footing is the u&s;e of Guaiacum in the Rheumati&s;m, in which it is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pecific. In the <HI>Angina,</HI> where there is no inflammation, it may be u&s;eful by promoting the diaphore&s;is; but in the ca&s;e of inflammation, it always does harm, and I have often in &s;uch ca&s;es &s;een the effects of it very difficult to remove. In &s;everal chronic rheumati&s;ms it is u&s;eful. In gouty ca&s;es, in &s;o far as it &s;timulates the &s;tomach, it may be u&s;eful; as every medicine in that di&s;ea&s;e will, which &s;timulates only to that degree, as to &s;trengthen. Guaiac, too, is &s;aid to prevent the Gout in the ex|tremities. How far that ought to be done by this, or any other me|dicine, &s;hall afterwards be mentioned.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the common virtues of our Bal&s;ams. They have vir|tues depending on their e&s;&s;ential oil, which, perhaps, in proportion to the quantity they contain of that, they will exert more power|fully. Thus the <HI>Bal&s;. Copaibae</HI> has much more oil in its compo&s;i|tion,
<PB N="267" REF="014000_0273_0F928BFEDFC3A720">
and is more powerful than the Turpentine. The others in this re&s;pect are not examined. Odour, too, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to vary the virtues of the&s;e Bal&s;ams; but a very great odour may re&s;ide in a very &s;mall quantity of matter. Whatever, then, may be &s;aid of the <HI>Bal&s;. Gileaden&s;e</HI> in the ea&s;tern countries, I do not know, as upon proper trial. I have not examined its virtues; but <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> I &s;hould expect little from it. I &s;hould much rather prefer tho&s;e which are cheaper, and le&s;s apt to be adulterated.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Bal&s;ams are apt to &s;tay long upon the &s;tomach, and I have known Turpentine continue there for &s;everal days in &s;ome ca&s;es, with trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms. In whatever manner they are divided, whether by yolk of egg, or more elegantly by mucilage, they are &s;oon collected, and re&s;i&s;t the power of the &s;tomach. Hence I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">magi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, we &s;hould get a better medicine by applying &s;pirituous men&s;trua to Fir-tops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than by giving the Bal&s;ams them&s;elves.

I was pre&s;ent at &s;ome experiments intended to a&s;certain the virtues of this medicine. In the do&s;e of half a drachm it heated the &s;tomach, produced &s;weat, and agreed with the Bal&s;ams in affecting the urinary pa&s;&s;ages. As commonly joined with the foetid gums, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed to promote the men&s;trual flux; but this virtue is only in common to it with other Stimulants. It does not, as the Aloes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> act by rarifying the blood.</P>

<HEAD>GUAIACUM.</HEAD>
<P>This wood certainly contains in its &s;ub&s;tance all the virtues of the Gum, but then this cannot be extracted from it, but by a &s;pi|rituous men&s;truum. Its &s;hare in the <HI>Tinct. Sennae compo&s;ita</HI> is re|commended by Dr. Lewis as a con&s;iderable improvement to that medicine. He &s;ays, that two drachms of Senna, infu&s;ed in eight ounces of Decoction of Guaiacum, will work as bri&s;kly as three drachms in plain water. The fact is certainly true, but it is owing merely to the largene&s;s of the men&s;truum; and I have known two pounds of Decoction of Guaiacum given without purgative quality. I &s;ay it is owing merely to the largene&s;s of the men&s;truum. For two drachms of Senna, infu&s;ed in eight ounces of water, will have equal effect with three drachms in four ounces. The decoction of the Woods is a medicine of little efficacy, and, I imagine, wholly in&s;ignificant. The virtues of the Woods re&s;ide in an e&s;&s;ential oil, which cannot be extracted with little boiling, or a &s;mall quantity of men&s;truum. If the coction and the men&s;truum are increa&s;ed, the e&s;&s;ential oil is di&s;&s;ipat|ed as much as the quantity extracted is enlarged. In &s;hort, during a practice of thirty years, I have never &s;een one cure performed by it, &s;o that it does not matter whether we allow the impregnation or not. It has been reckoned &s;pecific in venereal ca&s;es, but it is only efficaci|ous in the&s;e in &s;o far as joined with a &s;weating and emaciating cour&s;e; by which means the fluids are changed, e&s;pecially that in which Boerhaave &s;uppo&s;es the venereal poi&s;on to re&s;ide, the oil of the body. Although I do not entirely agree with Dr. Boerhaave in this notion, yet I am convinced that the emaciating cour&s;e is what in this ca&s;e has the &s;ole effect, and the <HI>Decoctum Bardanae</HI> will an&s;wer equally well with that of Guaiacum.</P>

About twenty years ago it was reckoned in&s;ignificant, but lately the Phy&s;ician at Li&s;bon having done great &s;ervice in venereal ca&s;es, by what is called the Li&s;bon diet-drink, many conjectures were about its compo&s;ition,
<PB N="271" REF="014000_0277_0F928C014E3A70D8">
and, among other things, it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be no other than a de|coction of Sar&s;aparilla, and this came again into practice under the reputation of curing venereal ca&s;es, in which Mercury failed. For|dyce, in the London Medical E&s;&s;ays, gives us &s;everal ca&s;es, in which Sar&s;aparilla was of con&s;iderable &s;ervice. Whatever, then, we may object to the difficulty of finding an explanation for tho&s;e virtues, to its want of &s;en&s;ible qualities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet the ca&s;es mentioned make me &s;ee foundation for the u&s;e of Sar&s;aparilla in practice. Fordyce con|de&s;cends upon particular times of the di&s;ea&s;e. None of the ca&s;es, in which Sar&s;aparilla cured, were recently venereal: It &s;eemed nece&s;|&s;ary that Mercury &s;hould have preceded its exhibition, and that in con&s;iderable quantity; &s;o that its u&s;e &s;eemed preferably confined to &s;uch ca&s;es as Mercury had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed in. We in this country know no peculiar <HI>Lues,</HI> and I have &s;een no ca&s;e in which Mercury failed; but certainly there may be &s;uch, ari&s;ing either from mi&s;management, and perhaps the bad effects of the Mercury, or perhaps the inveteracy of the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf. Whatever is in this, Sar&s;aparilla is chiefly directed in pains of the bones, from &s;uch circum&s;tances either ari&s;ing from cold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet &s;urely venereal. This I would take as a te&s;t of the efficacy of the Sar&s;aparilla, that in &s;uch pains where the patient had not &s;lept for a con&s;iderable time, the exhibition procured ea&s;e and re&s;t. If in &s;uch ca&s;es, after &s;uch te&s;timony as has been given, it fails, I would alledge, it was from the badne&s;s of the Sar&s;aparilla, or the inaccuracy in preparing it. I think that the fir&s;t ca&s;e is very com|mon, for I have never &s;een it with any &s;en&s;ible qualities; and in one ca&s;e where it had, they were different from tho&s;e a&s;cribed to it by <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers.

diaphoretic, or, as <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers call it, alexipharmic. It is u&s;ed in malignant, low, nervous Fevers, to &s;upport the <HI>vis vitae,</HI> and promote &s;weat. With regard to the u&s;e of acrid medicines in Fevers, I find it very difficult to know when they &s;hould be employ|ed, nor can we do &s;o till we have got a farther light into the theory of fevers.

<HEAD>AROMATICA FRAGRANTIORA.</HEAD>
<P>Such medicines are termed aromatic, as join with a pungent acrid ta&s;te a fragrant odour of the agreeable kind. They all abound in an e&s;&s;ential oil, which in the proper aromatics is &s;pecifically heavier than water, and are generally natives of the Torrid Zone. The whole of our li&s;t do not exactly agree in the&s;e characters, but are &s;ome of them &s;et down for the &s;amene&s;s of their e&s;&s;ential oil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They are di&s;|tributed into <HI>fa&s;ciculi.</HI> The fir&s;t &s;ix are be&s;t entitled to the appella|tion in every view. All of them have qualities very much in com|mon;
<PB N="273" REF="014000_0279_0F928C02B5D29080">
they &s;timulate the &s;tomach, a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion, and encrea&s;e ap|petite; in a &s;tronger degree take off &s;pa&s;ms in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> by maintaining the &s;tronger action of the &s;tomach; take off &s;pa&s;ms ari&s;ing from vegetable aliment, and, in general, except in inflamma|tory ca&s;es, are u&s;eful in all &s;pa&s;modic affections of the alimentary canal. However, they &s;eem rather appropriated for relieving tho&s;e &s;pa&s;ms when they occur, than to obviate them. Nothing is more common than to give aromatics with purgatives, which are liable to produce &s;pa&s;ms; but in obtaining the pretended effect of their obviat|ing &s;uch, I have been frequently di&s;appointed. On other occa&s;ions, Aromatics are u&s;ed in all cold di&s;ea&s;es of the head and brain, in all languors of the &s;y&s;tem, and, in &s;hort, for all the purpo&s;es of &s;timu|lants. All of them are of an inflammatory nature, having their virtue depending on an e&s;&s;ential oil, and apt to inflame the part to which they are applied. Tho&s;e Aromatics are mo&s;t &s;o which have this oil in greate&s;t quantity, and of the mo&s;t acrid kind.</P>
<P>They have been employed in the ca&s;e of Intermittent Fevers, in order to obviate the return of the fit, but by this practice we are always liable to change an Intermittent into a Continued Fever. Many Intermittents are of an inflammatory nature, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on; and in the&s;e e&s;pecially would aromatics be im|proper. The&s;e are the virtues of Aromatics in general, and are ap|plicable to each.</P>
<P>Though di&s;tributed into <HI>fa&s;ciculi,</HI> I do not well know how to di|&s;tingui&s;h them. The fir&s;t &s;ix are the mo&s;t proper Aromatics, mo&s;t agreeable, and mo&s;t u&s;ed in food. The <HI>Canella alba, Cortex Win|teranus,</HI> and <HI>Ginger,</HI> are of inferior degree of fragrancy, but &s;till are entitled to be ranked with the others. The <HI>Pepper</HI> and <HI>Cap&s;icum</HI> have little odour, but mo&s;t poignancy of ta&s;te, and are the mo&s;t powerful; which is an evidence of the &s;mall efficacy of odour in giving virtue; and from the want of odour they are more recom|mended in food in certain circum&s;tances. The e&s;&s;ential oil extracted from the&s;e, is milder than their &s;ub&s;tance; which &s;hows, we &s;hould

not always &s;uppo&s;e we have extracted all the virtues, where we have extracted the e&s;&s;ential oil, for often a part of that is &s;o heavy as not to ri&s;e. Alcohol, in &s;uch ca&s;es, affords the be&s;t impregnation. Pep|per, like Mu&s;tard, can be taken in &s;ix times the quantity when whole as in powder, without producing the &s;ame heat. In Inter|mittents, where Pepper is commended, this is the proper method of exhibition; for by this means the &s;tomach cannot extract &s;uch a con&s;iderable quantity at a time as to produce inflammation.</P>
<P>The next three have not an odour of the fragrant kind, and therefore are not u&s;ed in food. They have no other virtues but tho&s;e of the foregoing, and might be &s;afely rejected, were it not to afford that variety which is &s;ometimes required to adapt Stimulants to particular ta&s;tes.</P>
<P>The next three &s;ub&s;tances ought to be &s;eparated from this cla&s;s; for though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an acrid ta&s;te, they have a di&s;agreeable odour, and may be of different virtues.</P>
<P><HI>Galangals</HI> were introduced when we were in the humour of in|troducing every other exotic medicine. It is neither agreeable in odour nor ta&s;te, and is the weake&s;t of the cla&s;s, and therefore now properly rejected.</P>
<P><HI>Zedoary</HI> has a penetrating odour, like that of Camphire, and is &s;aid to afford a concrete of much the &s;ame nature, and therefore probably has anti&s;pa&s;modic virtues, which, however, are not yet a&s;|certained.</P>
<P><HI>Serpentaria Virginiana.</HI> This contains an acrid e&s;&s;ential oil, and therefore is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the virtues of the Aromatics. Its odour ap|proaches nearly to that of Valerian. Perhaps it is too frequently pre&s;cribed in the Edinburgh Di&s;pen&s;atory. Surely as an Aromatic it is le&s;s agreeable than many of the others. It is &s;uppo&s;ed of pecu|liar virtues. It is almo&s;t the only Aromatic we u&s;e in continual Fe|vers,

and I have &s;een it of good effect in low nervous Fevers, rai&s;|ing the pul&s;e, dimini&s;hing its frequency, and bringing the Fever to a happy i&s;&s;ue. It is certainly preferable to the <HI>Contrayerva.</HI> We call tho&s;e Fevers low and nervous, in which there is always a languor of the <HI>vis vitae,</HI> and of the nervous power. When this proceeds to a higher degree, and is accompanied with putrefaction, we call the Fever malignant. In the la&s;t ca&s;e, in the malignant Fevers, the <HI>Ser|pentaria</HI> is often evidently u&s;eful, and in the beginning of nervous Fevers, where there is no manife&s;t putrefaction, it is often of per|nicious con&s;equence. Dr. Pringle has been very attentive to malig|nant Fevers, and de&s;erves great prai&s;e for his ob&s;ervations on them, for from the&s;e we under&s;tand them better, and are le&s;s apt to &s;uppo&s;e their exi&s;tence oftner than it really is. From his notion of anti&s;eptics he was laid to exhibit the <HI>Serpentaria.</HI> But he him&s;elf gives us a caution, tho' prejudiced in its favour, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that he was now obliged to dimini&s;h his do&s;e, from the heating effects of this medicine. The&s;e heating effects are not &s;ometimes to be mea&s;ured by the temperature of the &s;kin, but the frequency of the pul&s;e. Tho' I have often &s;een good effects from this medicine, yet, as they are always very doubt|ful, as malignancy &s;eldom occurs here, and as I can obtain its good effects from medicines of a le&s;s inflammatory nature, and which I can exhibit with greater &s;afety, I have now laid it entirely a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Of the five next following, the <HI>Malabathrum</HI> and the two <HI>Nardi</HI> are now entirely neglected. The others manife&s;tly contain &s;ome|what of aromatic virtue, but &s;o weakly, that they have neither de|&s;erved nor obtained reputation.

This &s;aline &s;ub&s;tance in our Gums, is joined with a re&s;inous matter of remarkable acrimony. To both the Flowers and Gum have been attributed the &s;ame virtues, which makes me, indeed, very uncertain about them, as it is what I cannot po&s;&s;ibly imagine. They are &s;aid to be pectoral. I have &s;een them exhibited without &s;hewing any anti&s;pa&s;modic power, or promoting expectoration. In general, we ought to be very cautious in exhibit|ing &s;timulant Pectorals.

It is commonly &s;aid, that Bitters give more fixed alkali than other plants, and from a variety of trials I believe the fact to be true. What is to be inferred from this is very uncer|tain. The chymi&s;ts imagine they contain this, in the mixt, in the &s;ame &s;tate; but in this they are mi&s;taken; and though Bitters check fermentation, it is very far from being in the &s;ame manner as an al|kali, which acts by de&s;troying an acid.</P>

<HEAD>The common VIRTUES of BITTERS are the&s;e:</HEAD>
<P>All are more or le&s;s &s;timulating and &s;trengthening, hence are &s;uppo&s;ed to promote appetite, and a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion. In the <HI>Stomach</HI> they check fermentations of all kinds, on the one hand preventing a noxious acid, and on the other re&s;i&s;ting putrefaction. It is very probable, that their a&s;&s;i&s;ting dige&s;tion depends as much on this re&s;i&s;ting putrefac|tion, as on their &s;timulant quality; for many &s;ub&s;tances which con|tain more &s;timulus, are without that effect. Many Bitters excite

vomiting, but without any emetic power, as has been &s;uppo&s;ed. Univer&s;ally they are nau&s;eous; and, when taken in warm water, expede, rather than promote vomiting. The proof is this, that if a &s;light impregnation be equally nau&s;eous, it will be as effectual as a &s;trong one; and that given in powder, &s;o as to pa&s;s the fauces with|out being ta&s;ted, they have no &s;uch property.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI> their &s;timulant virtue is better founded. Their ta&s;te re&s;embles the bile of animals, and &s;eemingly in the &s;ame manner as that does, they &s;eem to promote the peri&s;taltic motion. In trying Chamaemile for the curing Intermittents, I have given it in the do&s;e of one ounce, without any proper purgative quality; though I mu&s;t own, in &s;uch quantity it commonly moves the belly. In the inte&s;tines we mu&s;t mention their anthelmintic quality. All animals &s;eem to &s;hew an aver&s;ion to the Bitters, and there are in&s;tances of in&s;ects avoiding their odour, which po&s;&s;ibly may be the ca&s;e with worms; and undoubtedly if the&s;e creatures &s;wallow them they may be de&s;troyed, as Bitters are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a poi&s;onous quality. But we now know, that anthelmintic bitters are of very little efficacy, and Phy&s;icians &s;uppo&s;e they act by &s;trengthening the tone of the in|te&s;tines, and &s;haking off the mucus, in which the eggs of the in&s;ects are contained. This, however, cannot be proved.</P>
<P>In the <HI>ma&s;s of blood.</HI> I have &s;een Bitters pa&s;s off by urine, in &s;ome ca&s;es giving colour and &s;mell to it, and at lea&s;t changing its condition. Bitters have been recommended in the Jaundice. The virtues, as we have formerly &s;aid of all medicines recommended in this di&s;ea&s;e, are much to be &s;u&s;pected. I mu&s;t now own, that after the u&s;e of Bitters, when the urine flowed yellow, its con&s;i&s;tence and condition was changed. As promoting urine, they have been u&s;ed in Drop&s;ies. By them&s;elves, their effects here are not very re|markable, but are promoted by union with alkaline &s;alts. The&s;e two medicines &s;eem mutually to increa&s;e each other's powers. Bit|ters are &s;aid to be diaphoretic and &s;udorific; and actually, in large do&s;es, and under proper regimen, they will excite &s;weat as &s;oon as
<PB N="280" REF="014000_0286_0F928C0BAAF44EB0">
any medicine I know. Whether this virtue is to be imputed to their action on the &s;kin, or on the &s;tomach, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. From the &s;uddenne&s;s of their effect, the latter is the more probable ca&s;e. In con&s;equence of their diaphoretic virtue, they are recommended as alexipharmics in Fevers, in which ca&s;es they may be given with more &s;afety than the Stimulants formerly mentioned, or the <HI>Ser|pentaria.</HI> In con&s;equence of their alexipharmic virtue, they have been &s;uppo&s;ed Deob&s;truents in the whole of the &s;y&s;tem, and u&s;ed in rheumatic affections. They have been &s;uppo&s;ed, too, as Stimu|lants, to promote the haemorrhoidal flux, and that of the men&s;es. Aloes has been alledged as an in&s;tance of Bitters promoting tho&s;e fluxes, but in that the Bitter is joined with a &s;ubtile purgative quality. In haemorrhoidal ca&s;es, in great quantity, they may be of &s;ome &s;ervice; in the ordinary quantity we employ them for the men&s;es, they are of none. As &s;trengthening the &s;y&s;tem, they have been u&s;ed in the cure of intermittents. They certainly will cure; but, after repeated trials, I have found them not near &s;o powerful as the Bark.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o been employed in continued Fevers, but the particular ca&s;es in which they are proper, are difficult to deter|mine. They have been &s;uppo&s;ed to remove ob&s;tructions in the abdominal vi&s;cera, and have been called hepatics and Splenetics. Their &s;pecific property I cannot conceive. They may be u&s;eful in Ob&s;tructions of the Liver and Spleen, as in tho&s;e of the other abdominal vi&s;cera, and therefore may be employed in cachectical ca&s;es. In &s;crophulous ca&s;es, if the Peruvian Bark be found of ad|vantage, we may infer the analogy to other Bitters. Bitters have been &s;uppo&s;ed to cure the <HI>Gout,</HI> and in one &s;hape they really do &s;o.</P>
<P>Not long ago, in England, the Duke of Portland's powder came into great reputation. It is compo&s;ed of the <HI>Ari&s;tolochia,</HI> and four other Bitters; for I con&s;ider the <HI>Ari&s;tolochia</HI> as a Bitter; though from its foetid odour it be transferred to another cla&s;s. This powder, in the Duke of Portland him&s;elf, and in many others who
<PB N="281" REF="014000_0287_0F928C0C9BCF79F0">
u&s;ed it, prevented the painful return of the Gout in Inflammation of the extremities, and thus &s;eemed to cure the di&s;ea&s;e; but almo&s;t always with a con&s;iderable change in the &s;y&s;tem, and pernicious con&s;equences. I may venture to &s;ay, that ninety of an hundred, who have taken this remedy, in a year or two after have been carried off by apoplexy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or &s;ome other mortal di&s;ea&s;e. In Scotland only twelve or fourteen per&s;ons have taken this powder, and all have done it with the con&s;equences I mention. The cour&s;e of the medicine mu&s;t be continued for two years to produce the cure propo&s;ed. Many have not had patience to go through this cour&s;e, and therefore with them the medicine has neither had the effect of curing the Gout, nor of bringing on any other di&s;ea&s;e. All this I mention from my own knowledge. For the hi&s;tory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of this medicine, you may look into a paper of Dr. Clephane, in the London E&s;&s;ays, where he &s;hews us it has been mentioned by every practical Phy&s;ician, &s;ince the time of Galen. Some alterations, at different times, have been made in the pre&s;cription; but &s;uch as allow it always to be con&s;idered as a bitter medicine. At the &s;ame time that Authors recommend it, they have always &s;ubjoined a caution as to its u&s;e. Upon its reputation in England, trial was made of it; and Gabius gives te&s;timony of its having the &s;ame effects we have &s;aid. Such is the &s;tate of the facts with regard to this u&s;e of Bitters. How they act in either ca&s;e, we &s;hall not take upon us ab&s;olutely to determine. This may throw &s;ome light upon any method, which may be taken to explain it. We have &s;aid that Stimulants de&s;troy the tone of the &s;tomach. Boerhaave, in a work, which, as &s;purious, I &s;hould not quote, were I not certain of the fact alledged, in his Praelections on the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> tells us, that <HI>Ari&s;tolochia</HI> de&s;troys the tone of the &s;tomach, &s;mooths the inner &s;ide of the &s;tomach, and takes off its villous coat. From all this we &s;ee how &s;paring ought to be the u&s;e of bitters in &s;tomach complaints. But as the Gout &s;eems to be &s;ent to the extremities, by the tone of the &s;tomach, we in &s;ome mea&s;ure conceive how Bitters act in pre|venting the appearance in the extremities. Whether it is from the
<PB N="282" REF="014000_0288_0F928C0D256768B0">
arthritic effort, if I may &s;o &s;peak, that the di&s;ea&s;e is thrown upon the brain, I &s;hall not determine.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the arthritic, we &s;hall here &s;peak of the antinephritic virtues imputed to Bitters, where they are &s;uppo&s;ed to act as diuretics. As this effect of being diuretic is not con&s;iderable, and as they are not &s;uppo&s;ed to change the figure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the &s;tones in the kidneys, from analogy we may infer, that their action is much in the &s;ame way with &s;ome medicines mentioned for the &s;tone. There is a &s;imilarity between arthritic and nephritic ca&s;es. It is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed that the nephritic fit is owing to the &s;ize, weight, roughne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the &s;tone in the kidneys. When a per&s;on is &s;eized with the Gout, he is relieved from the &s;ymptoms en&s;uing from &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;es; though how an inflammation can take off the &s;ize, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of a &s;tone in the kidneys, is to me im|po&s;&s;ible to imagine. We mu&s;t then &s;uppo&s;e, that the affection of the kidneys is the cau&s;e of concretion of the &s;tone, and not the latter of the former; in the &s;ame manner as Gout cau&s;es concretions of chalk, &s;o the Gout, from taking off this affection of the kidneys, relieves the &s;ymptoms con&s;equent upon it. This will be under&s;tood from what we have &s;aid on the <HI>Uva Ur&s;i.</HI> I cannot help mentioning a remarkable in&s;tance, where the &s;tone in the kidneys remained, and yet the patient was relieved from nephritic complaints by the attack of a gouty paroxy&s;m. A Gentleman, from nephritic com|plaints was &s;eized with exce&s;&s;ive &s;trangury, foetid purulent urine, and ulcers in the whole track of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, hectic par|oxy&s;ms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in&s;omuch that it was thought his ca&s;e was de&s;perate, when being unexpectedly &s;eized with the Gout, he was relieved from the&s;e complaints; his urine became le&s;s foetid, freer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and, for a fortnight, during which the Gout la&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, enjoyed an interval of ea&s;e from his nephritic pains. Nothing more clearly than this &s;hews the connexion between the <HI>Arthritis</HI> and <HI>Nephritis.</HI></P>
<P>I knew another per&s;on, who being troubled with the Gout, was &s;eized with a <HI>Nephritis,</HI> upon who&s;e encrea&s;e the Gout was propor|tionably
<PB N="283" REF="014000_0289_0F928C1117329D28">
dimini&s;hed. Upon di&s;&s;ection, no &s;tone was found in the kidneys. This ca&s;e &s;eems peculiarly to have been adapted to the <HI>Uva Ur&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>We have commonly been in u&s;e to neglect the antinephritic powers of Bitters; yet certainly, although we know their bad effects in the Gout, yet in nephritic ca&s;es they may have &s;till enough to be worth enquiring into. Upon the whole, we &s;ee the intimate connection between the two di&s;ea&s;es, which po&s;&s;ibly al&s;o may extend to their remedies; and certainly it would be equally ridiculous to reject their power upon the kidney, as to admit of their action on the &s;tone.</P>
<P>Bitters are alledged to have &s;omewhat of a narcotic quality, e&s;pe|cially applicable to tho&s;e which abound in e&s;&s;ential oil. So far as it is di&s;covered in Wormwood, it depends on the peculiarity of its e&s;&s;ential oil, and not on its Bitterne&s;s. Opium is a Bitter, but it would be fooli&s;h to &s;ay its narcotic qualities depended upon this. I chu&s;e to mention this, as &s;ome deduce the bad con&s;equences of Bitters from it.</P>
<P>Bitters are &s;aid to weaken the &s;y&s;tem in general, and particularly the genital powers. Of the truth of this I cannot &s;ay. It is &s;carcely to be known but from a very di&s;agreeable experiment, an experiment on one's-&s;elf. More certain am I of another bad effect imputed to them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> hurting the eyes. This, down from the times of the ancients, it has been ob&s;erved, that Wormwood (and the &s;ame pro|perty may re&s;ide in all) affects, like Sage, the eyes, with an unea&s;y dryne&s;s, weakne&s;s, contraction, and inflammation, attended with head-ach. The&s;e effects &s;eem to depend on the narcotic quality, as the few which have them abound in e&s;&s;ential oil.</P>

<P>It is in the leaves of the&s;e that the Bitterne&s;s re&s;ides; the root commonly contains an aromatic re&s;in, or, if it contains Bitter, it is of a weaker kind than that of the leaves.

<P>The three following are taken notice of as &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus, and therefore as of kindred virtues. Phy&s;icians, however, have been chu&s;ing, and di&s;puting about that choice. To me, the greate&s;t power of this genus &s;eems to re&s;ide in the <HI>Ab&s;ynthium vul|gare,</HI> and there in the leaves. It contains a con&s;iderable quantity of e&s;&s;ential oil, and is therefore chiefly noted for tho&s;e narcotic quali|ties we mentioned, and effects on the eyes. Its &s;mell is rank and di&s;|agreeable, but is lo&s;t by keeping; that is, evaporation of the vola|tile part. Dr. Lewis &s;ays, that after di&s;tilling Wormwood for the &s;imple water, that which remains in the &s;till, after the e&s;&s;ential oil is gone, is a pure bitter &s;ub&s;tance, and gives a con&s;iderable impregna|tion to <HI>alcohol.</HI> I am doubtful whether this practice be right, either in this, or other ca&s;es in which Lewis recommends it: At lea&s;t it remains to be enquired into, whether either the Bitter, or e&s;&s;ential oil, when &s;eparated, contain the virtues of the entire plant. The <HI>Ab&s;ynthium vulgare</HI> gives foundation for what I &s;aid of the root of this cla&s;s differing from the plant. Tho' I &s;aid <HI>Ab&s;ynthium</HI> was the &s;tronge&s;t of this cla&s;s, there may be others more &s;trongly aromatic; <HI>e. g.</HI> Haller mentions one which he found in Switzerland, which was u&s;ed as an univer&s;al febrifuge by the inhabitants of the Alps. Of the <HI>Artemi&s;ia</HI> we &s;hall &s;peak afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Carduus benedictus</HI> contains a more pure Bitter, and le&s;s e&s;&s;ential oil, and that not very volatile. It may be extracted like Wormwood,
<PB N="285" REF="014000_0291_0F928C127873ACE8">
but we find that heat applied di&s;&s;ipates it, in&s;omuch that the only agreeable Bitter to be obtained from <HI>Carduus benedictus,</HI> is by infu|&s;ion in cold water.</P>

<P><HI>Chamaemelum</HI> is the mo&s;t frequently employed, and undoubtedly has almo&s;t all the virtues we have been talking of. It abounds in pungent aromatic oil, is con&s;idered as the mo&s;t active of the Bitters, and, before invention of Peruvian Bark, was employed as a &s;ub|&s;titute for it. I have frequently tried it, and &s;ometimes with effect; but it falls much &s;hort of the powers of the Cortex, and, when given in con&s;iderable quantity, is much more apt to run off by &s;tool, and di&s;appoint our purpo&s;e. Simon Pauli relates, that a &s;trongly im|pregnated decoction of it in wine, comes at la&s;t to acquire a remark|ably &s;aline ta&s;te, like that of common &s;alt. Neuman confirms the &s;ame thing, and finds, that, like common &s;alt, it makes Precipitates, but that they are different from tho&s;e obtained by it. Believing this might ari&s;e from the wine, Neuman boiled that in the &s;ame manner by it&s;elf, but without obtaining what he got from its im|pregnation with the Wormwood.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, No. 173.</NOTE> Lewenhoeck, in his Experi|ments, finds the &s;ame &s;ort of cry&s;tals, re&s;embling tho&s;e of common &s;alt in <HI>Carduus benedictus,</HI> but unluckily did not try <HI>Chamaemile.</HI> This preparation ought to be enquired into.

We &s;eldom find it &s;o here; &s;o that I cannot give you the method of detecting it.

Whether its action here depends on the pro|per exhibition, or on a &s;pecific power, is di&s;puted. The la&s;t is com|monly &s;uppo&s;ed, and the manner of operating as difficult, &s;eems altogether neglected at pre&s;ent. I have formerly mentioned my aver&s;ion to &s;pecifies. Many perhaps we may be &s;till obliged to leave among that number, but &s;urely we ought to endeavour to leave as few as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In order to cure an Intermittent, the Bark mu&s;t be given in the interval of paroxy&s;ms, and it is univer&s;ally agreed, that in the fever they are hurtful. Here it acts in preventing the return of the cold fit, and it is pretty generally agreed, that the cold fit is the
<PB N="289" REF="014000_0295_0F928C1564784208">
cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Thus Boerhaave, after telling us the order of the fits, tells us, <HI>videtur is, qui primum tempus, &amp; primam cau&s;am, &s;uperare po&s;&s;it, etiam totum illum, paroxy&s;mum po&s;&s;e tollere.</HI></P>
<P>The prevention of Intermittents depending, then, on the pre|vention of the cold fit, and the Bark acting on this, its method of action mu&s;t be explained from the theory we form of the paroxy&s;m of Intermittents. If the cold fit be &s;aid to depend on the accumula|tion of the fluids in the extreme ve&s;&s;els, the Bark alters that accu|mulation; if on an affection of the moving fibres, the Bark obviates the return of the &s;pa&s;modic affection. One of the&s;e we mu&s;t take up with. I agree with the la&s;t. At this time I will not enter into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that opinion, or the rea&s;ons for a&s;&s;enting to it. On this &s;ubject you may con&s;ult Van Swieten, Hoffman, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;hall give a hint or two upon it.</P>
<P>The paroxy&s;m of Intermittents &s;eems &s;o much an affection of the nervous power, that it is frequently induced and obviated by <HI>animi pathemata.</HI> All periodic affections are either of the &s;pa&s;modic or feveri&s;h kind. I own there may be &s;ome difference between the&s;e, but, from being the only di&s;tinctions, they may be &s;uppo&s;ed very much of the &s;ame nature. That neither <HI>lentor,</HI> nor a putrid <HI>fomes,</HI> as &s;ome have alledged, takes place, may be concluded hence, that all periodic affections may become habitual. It is a rule of Cel&s;us, that when a per&s;on is cured of an Intermittent, he ought to avoid every thing which would cau&s;e a return of the paroxy&s;m, e&s;peci|ally on tho&s;e days in which the fit <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to return. Now in this ca&s;e, that per&s;on who thus (and it is frequently the ca&s;e) is apt to have a recurrence of the paroxy&s;m, is commonly in good health, and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be affected with a putrid <HI>fomes.</HI> It is my opinion, then, that the Bark acts by obviating the &s;pa&s;modic af|fection, to which the &s;y&s;tem is &s;o liable, and accordingly we find it a remarkable remedy in all affections of this kind.</P>
<P>We &s;hould wi&s;h to go farther, and find this property connected with the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the Bark. The Bark is a Bitter, and
<PB N="290" REF="014000_0296_0F928C190CC48248">
other Bitters have the &s;ame effect. I have &s;een in&s;tances, but not frequently, of Bitters curing intermittents. That Bitters are not &s;o powerful as the Bark, may ari&s;e from that being &s;tronger, from their being joined with other qualities, from improper exhibition, or exhibition in too &s;mall do&s;es. Thus Chamaemile flowers &s;up|po&s;ed by Pitcairn equally &s;pecific with the Bark, are much more li|able to run off by &s;tool; po&s;&s;ibly, if joined with an opiate, that effect might be prevented. The Bark, then, being only a &s;tronger Bitter, we mu&s;t not confine the property of curing Intermittens to it, but extend it to other Bitters. All this, however, amounts to nothing more than a &s;pecific quality of Bitters.</P>
<P>Let us view this matter in another light. Bark is &s;en&s;ibly an A&s;tringent, and other A&s;tringents have been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in the &s;ame ca&s;es; Alum, Steel, and vegetable A&s;tringents. Galls, in France, by Renaud and Homberg, were found a remedy in Inter|mittents. The Academy ordered Lemery, Geoffroy, and other Members, to make trial of it, and their report was, that Galls did cure Intermittents, though not &s;o con&s;tantly as the Bark. Bark, then, as an A&s;tringent, may only be of a &s;tronger nature, &s;ince proof remains of pure A&s;tringents acting in the &s;ame way. Far|ther it does not appear, from experiments mentioned, how much may be the effect of pure A&s;tringents; for Renaud only gave the medicine in a &s;mall do&s;e; for in the exhibition of A&s;tringents we are ever in fear of exceeding in quantity; and it has been objected to the Bark, &s;uppo&s;ing it an A&s;tringent, that by its exhibition in the quantity given, we &s;hould be in danger of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing healthy eva|cuations. It is po&s;&s;ible, then, that had the Galls been given in &s;uf|ficient do&s;e, they had much oftner effected a cure. Others who are of a different opinion, allow the A&s;tringents may cure Inter|mittents, but that that is very &s;eldom, and that it is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary Bitters &s;hould be joined with A&s;tringency. Hence it is, that in Germany they u&s;e Trifoil and Tormentil joined, and with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As A&s;tringents, in many other ca&s;es, are anti&s;pa&s;modic, it is highly probable that the action of the Bark is nearly of the &s;ame kind.
<PB N="291" REF="014000_0297_0F928C194170E198">
Whether in any &s;en&s;e it is anti&s;pa&s;modic, in the common accepta|tion of the word, I &s;hall not determine. Its operation may be ex|plained in this manner.</P>
<P>I have formerly told you what I meant by tone of the fibres. Tonic medicines are &s;uch as give this tone to the fibres, oppo&s;ed on the one hand to rigidity, and on the other to laxity. That &s;uch a tone takes place in the whole fibres of the human body, e&s;pecially in the blood ve&s;&s;els, where &s;ome have doubted it, appears to me &s;ufficiently evident. This tone depends on the firmne&s;s of cohe&s;ion of the &s;imple &s;olids, and on the influx of the nervous power. The fir&s;t being commonly given, it is plain tone mu&s;t depend chiefly on the la&s;t. Now although it be doubted of the mu&s;cular fibres of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, yet as they are of the &s;ame nervous origin, they are therefore depending, for their tone, on a certain influx of the nervous power. Nothing is more common than to &s;ee mobility de|pending on <HI>atonia,</HI> as Hoffman terms it. By increa&s;ing the tone of our fibres, does the Bark &s;eem to act in obviating the return of &s;pa&s;modic affections. All this will be confirmed by attending to the hi&s;tory of Intermittents, and the proper exhibition of the Bark in them.</P>
<P>In their paroxy&s;m it is pretty evident, that amid&s;t tho&s;e &s;pa&s;modic motions which occur, there is always a con&s;triction in the &s;urface of the body. Our tonic medicine encrea&s;es that con&s;triction, and there|fore ought not to be exhibited in the hot fit where that takes place.</P>
<P>That con&s;triction, e&s;pecially at the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, not only remains through the whole fit, but al&s;o in the interval, and therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary to allow the di&s;ea&s;e to go on, through &s;everal paroxy&s;ms, till by repeated &s;weats the con&s;triction is removed. Hence the caution of practitioners, not to give the Bark till after the di&s;ea&s;e has had a few returns.</P>
<P>In proof of con&s;triction taking place in the extreme ve&s;&s;els, the blood, during the paroxy&s;m, is collected in the vi&s;cera or abdomen.
<PB N="292" REF="014000_0298_0F928A9274585848">
Till this determination, therefore, be taken off, and the balance re|&s;tored to the &s;urface, it is imprudent to exhibit the Bark. Hence we premi&s;e Emetics, to determine to the &s;urface and take off ob|&s;tructions, in the abdominal vi&s;cera. When the Bark is exhibited, it mu&s;t be joined with purgatives, to obviate the a&s;triction in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and the ob&s;tructions we have mentioned. When the&s;e are removed, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the purgative effect of the Bark it&s;elf, or the exhibition of other purgatives along with it, will di&s;|appoint our intention. The rea&s;on is this: It is found, that every debilitating power applied to the body, &s;uch as evacuations, cooling medicines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> favour the return of Intermittents. Hence, then&punc; the evacuation produced, either by the Bark it&s;elf, or other &s;ub&s;tances, does more than compen&s;ate by its weakening effects, the power of the Bark, in &s;trengthening the tone of the fibres. Sometimes, however, effects may be mixed, and the Bark an&s;wer where a purging en&s;ues. Here, although the chief operation of the Bark be on the &s;tomach, yet a part of it may be carried into the blood, and obviate, compen|&s;ate, or overpower the effects of the purging.</P>
<P>Wherever an inflammatory diathe&s;is obtains in the &s;y&s;tem, where|ever the <HI>vis tonica</HI> is increa&s;ed, there the Bark is hurtful. In the blood ve&s;&s;els this increa&s;e of the <HI>vis tonica</HI> appears from the ten&s;ion of the pul&s;e. Hence it is the Bark is not near &s;o effectual in vernal, as in &s;ummer or autumnal agues.</P>
<P>On the contrary, wherever a putrid diathe&s;is prevails, there the <HI>vis tonica</HI> is dimini&s;hed below the &s;tandard, and there univer&s;ally the Bark is u&s;eful. I am very ready to allow, with Dr. Pringle, that a putre&s;cency accompanies Autumnal Intermittents, and that the Bark is noted for its anti&s;eptic quality. But the &s;mall quantity given, and &s;till more, the very &s;mall quantity extracted, and the little that mu&s;t be ab&s;orbed of that quantity extracted, to me would &s;eem to have very little effect in preventing the putre&s;cency of the fluids. Much more do I imagine (and Dr. Pringle con&s;ents to it, and enumerates other A&s;tringents which have the &s;ame property) that the Bark, in
<PB N="293" REF="014000_0299_0F928A932D2B5AC0">
&s;uch ca&s;es, acts by re&s;toring tone to the fibres, debilitated by putre|faction.</P>
<P>Hence not only in Autumnal Intermittents, but in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> putrid Fe|vers and in putrid diathe&s;is of all kinds; in all remittent Fe|vers, where the remi&s;&s;ion is evident, and in anomalous or malig|nant Fevers, where a putrefaction takes place, the Bark is u&s;ed with advantage. With regard to continued Fevers, there al&s;o the Bark is employed; but with more di&s;pute than in the former ca&s;es, and without any per&s;ons, as far as I know, having a&s;certained the &s;tate of continued Fevers in which it &s;hould be exhibited. Continued Fevers are not what the ancients called <HI>Febres continentes,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> &s;uch as after the cold fit had a hot fit following it, and continued during the whole cour&s;e, till the Fever was terminated by a cri&s;is. There is a di&s;tinction betwixt the <HI>Febres continentes</HI> and <HI>continuae;</HI> for in the la&s;t they acknowledged a remi&s;&s;ion to occur. In my prac|tice I have never been able to &s;ee a continent Fever, and I find, from the accounts of the ancients, that they confirm me in this. Hence I would alledge, that every Fever whatever con&s;i&s;ts of the return of a repeated number of paroxy&s;ms. If this be the ca&s;e, and as the return of the paroxy&s;ms depends on that of the cold fit, it is plain that by obviating the return of &s;pa&s;modic acce&s;&s;ion, the Bark may be as u&s;eful in continued, as in intermittent Fevers. But the difficulties attending the exhibition of the Bark in Intermittents, are much greater here. <HI>There,</HI> as the Bark can neither be given in the cold nor hot fits, nor &s;ometimes even in the interval, when the con|&s;triction on the &s;urface is not removed, it is plain that <HI>here</HI> the exhi|bition will be more dubious, where the effects of the hot fit will be more continued. Wherever an inflammatory diathe&s;is and encrea&s;ed <HI>vis tonica</HI> are pre&s;ent, we mu&s;t certainly avoid the Bark; and in the continued Fever, it is very difficult to a&s;certain the times of acce&s;|&s;ion or remi&s;&s;ion, another ob&s;tacle to its u&s;e. <HI>If a di&s;tinct remi&s;&s;ion ap|pear, we may exhibit the Bark with confidence and &s;ucce&s;s.</HI> No body better illu&s;trates this than Cleghorn. When the Bark was not given at the remi&s;&s;ion, his patients died. He watched the time of re|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="294" REF="014000_0300_0F928A93E719E340">
and, given then, found the Bark &s;ucceed in ca&s;es termed de&s;perate. If any body would &s;tudy this &s;ubject farther, he mu&s;t con&s;ult Dr. Morton, a writer who abounds as much in practical facts and ob&s;ervations as any, but, as falling into a &s;y&s;tem of theory very different from the &s;imple &s;agacity of Sydenham, too much neglected. He con&s;tantly u&s;ed the Bark in continued Fevers with the cautions mentioned. One ca&s;e, however, of continued Fever (whatever ambiguity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> as to the re&s;t) there is, where the Bark may be employed without regard to intermi&s;&s;ion, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> where|ever a putrid diathe&s;is has gone to a great length in the &s;y&s;tem. I would alledge this often takes place where the di&s;ea&s;e is very in|flammatory in the beginning. Wherever <HI>maculae petechiae, &amp;c.</HI> appear, there, I think, the Bark may be univer&s;ally employed. A di&s;pute is carried on between De Haen and Pringle about the na|ture of <HI>petechiae.</HI> From the experiments of the latter it appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, that in all &s;uch ca&s;es the Bark is the remedy chiefly to be tru&s;ted. De Haen, in his <HI>Ratio medendi,</HI> gives many in&s;tances of putrid Fevers cured by this remedy; and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, who have u&s;ed the Bark in the&s;e Fevers, give &s;imilar in&s;tances of its good effect. For the u&s;e of the Bark in Fevers, be&s;ide the authors above-men|tioned, you &s;hould carefully con&s;ult Franci&s;cus Torti, in his <HI>The|rapeutice &s;pecialis,</HI> and Werlhoff, <HI>De Febrib.</HI> edit. 1745.</P>
<P>In Dy&s;entery the Bark is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o frequently employed as in &s;ome of the foregoing ca&s;es, but &s;till &s;o often as to convince us of its utility. I con&s;ider Dy&s;entery as a febrile di&s;ea&s;e, and every body knows, that it is founded in, or cau&s;es a putrid diathe&s;is. This di&s;ea&s;e in the beginning is often inflammatory, and then the Bark is improper. Such inflammatory Dy&s;enteries, by continuance, often grow putrid, and in all &s;uch, as well as the originally putrid, the Bark is of great efficacy. In one of the&s;e ca&s;es, if given in &s;ufficient quantity, the action of the Bark may be con&s;idered as anti&s;eptic to the fluids in the <HI>primae viae;</HI> but in a more advanced Dy&s;entery it mu&s;t act chiefly as a&s;tringent. We have had much delicacy in the u&s;e of A&s;tringents in the Dy&s;entery, but, in gener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="295" REF="014000_0301_0F928A94AE2B0BC8">
we &s;hould &s;ucceed much better, did we exhibit them more fre|quently, and more early than we do. Dy&s;entery, as Sydenham terms it, may be con&s;idered as a <HI>Febris introver&s;a,</HI> with con&s;tric|tion of the &s;kin. Now the Bark, as a tonic medicine, may not only be more &s;afely applied than &s;imple A&s;tringents, but will like|wi&s;e act in re&s;toring the equilibrium to the &s;urface. Several writers have taken notice of the u&s;e of the Bark in Dy&s;entery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you may con&s;ult a treati&s;e by Wil&s;on at Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Bark is al&s;o employed in Gangrene and Mortification. Its effi|cacy is now &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed by univer&s;al con&s;ent. If any doubt remain of its virtue here, where the ill &s;ucce&s;s has not ari&s;en from mi&s;management, it may, perhaps, be thus explained. There are properly two kinds of Gangrene; the one kind ari&s;ing from the violence of inflammation purely, the other from a flaccidity of the ve&s;&s;els of the part, or, at the &s;ame time, an <HI>atonia</HI> of the whole &s;y&s;tem. Every body knows the fir&s;t; the la&s;t is what occurs in hydroptic, paralytic, or old people. It is in the la&s;t, that the Bark &s;eems peculiarly appropriated, and very &s;eldom, in the&s;e ca&s;es, if given in a proper do&s;e, does it fail to bring on a &s;uppuratory inflam|mation, and &s;eparate the mortified part. In purely inflammatory Gangrenes, if it has not been &s;ucce&s;sful, it is from improper exhibi|tion, and the rea&s;on is obviou&s;ly this, that the Bark, acting by giving tone to the moving fibres, mu&s;t certainly be hurtful where that is &s;o much encrea&s;ed by di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>We have attempted to cure Fevers by a variety of Stimuli, in order to excite &s;uch a degree of Fever, as might obviate the &s;ymp|toms of acce&s;&s;ion. But the Peruvian Bark does not operate by its aroma; for the pul&s;e by it is not encrea&s;ed above its healthy &s;tand|ard; and altho' it takes off flaccidity, yet it does not irritate the heart and ve&s;&s;els. It is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve this, in order to talk of the cau&s;e and cure of &s;uppuration. Where &s;uppuration is wanting, it depends very often on the flaccidity of the part. In this ca&s;e, it is brought on by Stimulants applied to the part. It is in this
<PB N="296" REF="014000_0302_0F928A96DA5C5A20">
manner that I think all the bal&s;amic &s;ub&s;tances act, and likewi&s;e Copper and Mercury, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in re&s;toring the tone of the flaccid fibres. In the &s;ame way, in &s;tagnating, &s;anious, and ichorous Ulcers, the Bark mends the &s;uppuration, and brings on a kindly healing of the &s;ore.</P>
<P>Not long ago the Bark has been &s;aid to cure Cancers, but in all of the&s;e its effects are not remarkable; and we are here liable to be deceived, as very often where there is an Ulcer <HI>mali moris,</HI> it is apt to be confounded with a Cancer. But even in Cancers I have &s;een its good effects, and the matter mended by its u&s;e; and Ulcers <HI>pe&s;&s;imi moris</HI> I have &s;een cured by it. In &s;hort, wherever a &s;up|puration is to be carried on, not in its own nature inflammatory, and wherever, in &s;uch ca&s;es, there is a tendency to the &s;inking of the <HI>vis vitae,</HI> the Bark is u&s;eful. Hence, &s;ucce&s;sfully it has been ex|hibited in the Small Pox, which I con&s;ider merely as a &s;uppura|tory di&s;ea&s;e. Wherever the Small Pox are attended with an in|flammation round the pu&s;tules, and that inflammation extends to the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem, the Bark may be pernicious, and is cer|tainly hurtful; whereas at tho&s;e times where a putrid diathe&s;is is more evident, and the topical inflammation does not appear, it has been as remarkably u&s;eful in bringing on a proper &s;uppuration. If any doubt remain of its efficacy in the Small Pox, it is from its promi&s;cuous u&s;e. You &s;ee it ought properly to be confined to the &s;uppuratory &s;tate, and, in general, ought not to be given till the fifth or &s;ixth day. I know it has been u&s;ed in the eruptive Fever, but I imagine with bad con&s;equences; for where there is an in|flammatory &s;tate over the whole body, it mu&s;t certainly do mi&s;|chief. This la&s;t rule is without exception, except in Small Pox of a &s;ingular kind, where, from the very beginning, they appear with <HI>petechiae.</HI> As to the &s;econdary Fever of the Small Pox, its u&s;e there is more doubtful. This I know, that very often, (and it is commonly the ca&s;e) that Fever is inflammatory, and much better cured by blood-letting and purging, than any other means, and rendered wor&s;e by the u&s;e of the Bark; for by the eruptive
<PB N="297" REF="014000_0303_0F928A98DEE754C8">
Fever the body is left in an inflammatory &s;tate. In the Mea&s;les this is very remarkable, and al&s;o occurs in the Small Pox, and I take it, that wherever an evacuation is to be carried on, the Bark is in|con&s;i&s;tent, &s;uperfluous, or hurtful, and then only u&s;eful where a pu|trid diathe&s;is is very evident in the fir&s;t part of a &s;econdary Fever, or apt to occur in its continuance.</P>
<P>As efficacious in Ulcers and in the Small Pox, &s;ome have thought of extending the u&s;e of the Bark to internal Ulcers, and have u&s;ed it in the <HI>phthi&s;is pulmonalis.</HI> Phy&s;icians now &s;ee that its bad effects are evident&punc; and almo&s;t inevitable in this ca&s;e. The rea&s;on is, that the <HI>phthi&s;is pulmonalis</HI> is accompanied with an inflammatory &s;tate. A practice, about thirty years ago, was propo&s;ed by Dr. Dover, of curing Con&s;umptions by frequent and &s;mall bleedings, and I my|&s;elf have &s;een a phthi&s;ical per&s;on bled to the fiftieth time, and I ne|ver &s;aw the blood drawn in &s;uch ca&s;es without that cru&s;t which is the &s;ign of inflammation. Very often the ca&s;e is purely inflamma|tory, and almo&s;t always partly &s;o.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal u&s;es of the Bark, in which I have en|deavoured to explain its operation. Some &s;pecial ca&s;es yet remain. The Bark has been employed in &s;crophulous ca&s;es. The Scro|phula is attended with Ulcers <HI>mali moris,</HI> depending on a flaccidity of the ve&s;&s;els of the part, and of the &s;y&s;tem in general very often; &s;o that here the Bark is plainly indicated, and I make no doubt of the &s;ucce&s;s had by Doctors Fothergill and Fordyce in &s;uch circum&s;tances. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the Bark very often fails in this di&s;ea&s;e. But even the&s;e Gentlemen have not always &s;ucceeded, becau&s;e I im|agine this di&s;ea&s;e is often not to be cured certainly by any medicine; for it &s;eems often a di&s;ea&s;e of the lymph, &s;eated in the &s;ymphatic ve&s;&s;els, and not depending &s;o much on a general flaccidity of the &s;y&s;tem in general, as in &s;ome peculiar affection of the lymphatics, and matter generated there.</P>
<P>More &s;ucce&s;sfully has the Bark been given, as a remedy of &s;pa&s;modic affections, in the hypochondriac and hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e,
<PB N="298" REF="014000_0304_0F928A9A0FCFC290">
and in certain kinds of A&s;thma; but here not with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s as to be reckoned a &s;pecific. Wherever di&s;ea&s;e depends on a mo|bility, and that on a debility, and wherever the&s;e are cau&s;es or effects of di&s;ea&s;e, and not complicated with ob&s;tructions formed, there the Bark may be &s;afely and &s;ucce&s;sfully employed. In the hy|pochondriac di&s;ea&s;e, then, where the vi&s;cera yet remain entire, we may have recour&s;e to the Bark; but in the decline of life, when the di&s;ea&s;e is properly hypochondriac, and where there are con&s;iderable ob&s;tructions in the vi&s;cera, there it mu&s;t manife&s;tly do prejudice. On the contrary, in the pure hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e, without labes of the vi&s;cera, depending on cau&s;es acting on too moveable con&s;titutions, pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Bark is very proper, and &s;hould al|ways be u&s;ed. Epilep&s;y often depends on &s;imilar mobility, and here al&s;o it mu&s;t be u&s;eful; but where that di&s;ea&s;e depends on a wrong conformation of the brain, little &s;ervice can be expected from the Bark. Sir John Floyer found the &s;pa&s;modic A&s;thma, and the hy|&s;teric, without labes of the lungs, pretty certainly relieved by the Bark, but wherever the lungs are over-loaded, and expectoration is nece&s;&s;ary, there it is found hurtful.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Chorea Sancti Viti,</HI> or tho&s;e complicated, irregular, &s;pa&s;|modic motions, which occur in per&s;ons of a lax moveable con&s;ti|tution, the Bark is a remedy to be depended on. Sydenham pro|po&s;es this di&s;ea&s;e to be treated by evacuations, and in the begin|ning, where there is a fulne&s;s, they may certainly be nece&s;&s;ary; but by their continuance, I have never &s;een the di&s;ea&s;e cured; while the Bark prevailed, after an un&s;ucce&s;sful trial of them.</P>
<P>The Bark has been propo&s;ed in the ca&s;e of men&s;trual ob&s;tructions. The&s;e are of various kinds. One &s;pecies, which occurs at the fir&s;t attack of the men&s;es, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Chloro&s;is,</HI> &s;eems, when we take a view of it, to be attended with all the &s;ymptoms of flaccidity and want of tone, and for this rea&s;on is commonly treated with Steel; and wherever that remedy &s;ucceeds, there have I &s;een the Bark ex|hibited with equal advantage. Men&s;trual ob&s;tructions, however, may ari&s;e from cau&s;es acting particularly on the uterus, and not on
<PB N="299" REF="014000_0305_0F928A9AB2A5D9D0">
the &s;y&s;tem in general, and there neither Bark nor Chalybeates &s;hould be given. It is not very common to employ Bark in <HI>Chloro&s;is,</HI> or ob&s;tructed men&s;es.</P>
<P>Much more commonly is the Bark exhibited in the <HI>fluxu nimio men&s;ium.</HI> Here, too, A&s;tringents and Chalybeates are employed, and given in &s;uch quantity as to bring on &s;trong a&s;triction. Whe|ther the Bark an&s;wers equally well as an a&s;tringent with the preparations of Iron, I &s;hall not &s;ay. Wherever the profu&s;ion depends on irritability and flaccidity, there I employ the Bark joined with <HI>Sal martis,</HI></P>
<P>It has been a que&s;tion, whether the Bark may be employed in other Haemorrhages? I think we may an&s;wer in the negative, generally. In ca&s;es of Haemorrhage that depend on mobility and debility, the Bark may be u&s;ed with advantage; and in tho&s;e by long &s;ub&s;i&s;tence become habitual and periodical. But Haemorrhages &s;trictly con&s;idered, and tho&s;e by unu&s;ual outlets, are con&s;tantly of the inflammatory kind. Thus Haemopto&euml;, in nine of ten ca&s;es, depends on an inflammatory diathe&s;is. There may, however, be ca&s;es of Haemopto&euml;, which have long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and are kept up by laxity, where both the Bark and A&s;tringents may do &s;ervice. The&s;e it is very difficult to di&s;cern, and where the in|flammatory are mi&s;taken for them, bad con&s;equences will follow.</P>
<P>In Dr. Haller's collection of Di&s;&s;ertations, there is one on the u&s;e of the Bark in Jaundice. I will not ab&s;olutely deny the u&s;e of the Bark in this ca&s;e. We might &s;ay, that other A&s;tringents have been u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. But now we know that Jaundice very often depends on &s;tones in the biliary ducts, which pa&s;s &s;lowly through; &s;o that the medicine given at the time of their falling out, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> has imputed to it the virtue of curing the di&s;ea&s;e. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ee how medicines of this kind &s;hould promote the pa&s;&s;age of &s;uch &s;tones, and at any rate, from the Author of the Di&s;&s;ertation, we cannot be certain of the

effects of the Bark. He &s;eems unacquainted with the po&s;&s;ibility of the accidents above-mentioned, and joins with the Bark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides, he gives the Bark in too &s;mall quantity to produce any effect.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> farrago of other medicines, &s;ome of which, perhaps, are more adapted to the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>There is another di&s;ea&s;e, in which the Bark is employed, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Chin-cough. I have had frequent experience of the u&s;e of the Bark here. The efficacy of the Bark here &s;hews the di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;pa&s;modic kind, or, the &s;pa&s;modic nature of the di&s;ea&s;e being given, &s;hews the rea&s;onablene&s;s of u&s;ing the Bark in it. Wherever a child can be made to take the Bark in &s;ufficient quantity, by the mouth, it is almo&s;t a certain cure for the chin-cough; and even by injec|tion, though not &s;o con&s;tantly, it &s;ucceeds. As to the time of ex|hibition, when the di&s;ea&s;e is recent, and there are &s;ymptoms of an infarction in the lungs, while yet no &s;olution of the &s;pa&s;m appears, nor expectoration takes place, I imagine the exhibition of the Bark is dangerous, and bleeding and emetics mu&s;t be premi&s;ed. Often in the Chin-cough a bleeding at the no&s;e and vomiting en&s;ue, both which are favourable &s;ymptoms, and therefore before a bleeding at the no&s;e or vomiting en&s;ue, if there be not a certainty of no in|farction in the Lungs, I never gave the Bark; but after the&s;e I always exhibit it with &s;ucce&s;s. I have had in the exhibition of this remedy in the Chin-cough little regard to the Fever, except in the beginning, always giving it where the di&s;ea&s;e has been drawn out to a great length. The only caution to be regarded is this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to avoid giving it in the evening hours, where an exacerbation of the Fever en&s;ues, and rather to exhibit it in the morning and forenoon, &s;topping before the mid-day acce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have only to add one more practical direction, which I had not an opportunity of mentioning. I mentioned how apt intermittents were to return, from habit. This leads us to give the Bark in con&s;iderable quantity. The Bark has been &s;aid not to cure Quar|tans. In the&s;e the tendency to continue is very great, and a large
<PB N="301" REF="014000_0307_0F928A9C287F7268">

proportion of Bark is nece&s;&s;ary; nor, indeed, ought it to be limi|ted to any quantity, but given in as great as the &s;tomach can bear. There are in&s;tances of per&s;ons taking one ounce at one do&s;e, without bad con&s;equences; and I my&s;elf have &s;een half an ounce exhibited with great &s;afety. In general, the bad effects of the Bark depend on exhibiting it in improper ca&s;es, &s;eldom on the quantity given. We are often &s;traitened with regard to the interval for the u&s;e of the Bark, as even in the Quotidian Ague, we ought never to exhibit it, but between the paroxy&s;ms. Some are &s;o nice, that although the paroxy&s;m does not appear, yet they &s;top the exhibition of the Bark, till the time in which the interval &s;hould again appear. But I find, that if the paroxy&s;m does not come on, and no &s;en&s;e of cold, palene&s;s of the nails, or languor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> take place, we may continue with &s;afety; and by this method have I cured Agues which would not yield in the other way.</P>
<P>It has been objected to the u&s;e of the Bark, that Intermittents are apt to return, that there is no end of pouring in the Bark, and that the &s;y&s;tem will be de&s;troyed by it. But I am per&s;uaded, that this is owing to not continuing the Bark in &s;ufficient quantity; for though the paroxy&s;m di&s;appears for a &s;hort time, yet the tendency &s;till remaining, it &s;oon gains &s;trength and recurs. We ought to proceed in this manner. After the di&s;ea&s;e is removed, we &s;hould return to the u&s;e of the Bark in three or four days; after that in the interval of a week, then a fortnight, and &s;o on, if I may &s;o call it, during the epidemic &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>As to the pharmaceutical treatment of the Bark, it ought always to be exhibited in large quantities, and in &s;ub&s;tance; for the powers of the &s;tomach &s;eem much greater upon it than tho&s;e of any men&s;truum out of the body. With &s;ome rea&s;on it has been imagined, that the action of the Bark is upon the &s;tomach. Hence it has been &s;aid, that all fluid preparations of it pa&s;s off by the pylorus, and for that rea&s;on do not an&s;wer &s;o well as the &s;imple Bark, which remains much longer. This rea&s;oning is ingenious, but we may be &s;atisfied with what was alledged of the &s;mallne&s;s
<PB N="302" REF="014000_0308_0F928A9CE7E14A20">
of the quantity extracted. With regard to the extraction, long boiling de&s;troys its virtues. Ten grains of the Extract has been &s;aid to be equal to half a drachm of the Bark in powder; but in practice I find that equal quantities are nece&s;&s;ary, and con&s;idering the long coction de&s;troys the texture, as much as it enlarges the quantity extracted, it is no wonder that it is &s;o. As &s;pirits di&s;agree with many, wherever extraction is nece&s;&s;ary, we mu&s;t employ water; and infu|&s;ion with water is preferable to decoction, being equally &s;trong and pre&s;erving the aroma.

<HEAD>PHARMACEUTICAL TREATMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Pretty univer&s;ally they are more agreeable in their dry &s;tate than in their recent. Mo&s;t of them contain an oil, of which a portion is more volatile than the re&s;t, and gives a rank, di&s;agreeable odour to the &s;ubject, and, which I imagine is not without foundation, thought of a narcotic, inebriating quality. This odour is lo&s;t by drying, and even the milde&s;t Bitters, <HI>e. g.</HI> Centaury, have &s;ome of it. When any con&s;iderable efficacy is to be expected from their u&s;e, they &s;hould be exhibited in &s;ub&s;tance, both on account of the diffi|culty, except they are in a very tender herbaceous &s;tate, of extract|ing them perfectly, and perhaps al&s;o from its being nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be detained &s;ometime in the &s;tomach. Another ob&s;tacle is, that in their recent or di&s;&s;olved &s;tate, they are much more apt to run off by &s;tool than when dry. Their bitterne&s;s does not re&s;ide in an e&s;&s;ential oil to be rai&s;ed by di&s;tillation, but in a more fixed, partly gummy, and partly re&s;inous &s;ub&s;tance, and therefore to be extracted both by water and alcohol; by water a greater quantity, by &s;pirit a &s;tronger, purer, and more elegant Bitter being extracted, which
<PB N="305" REF="014000_0311_0F928AA2F98094C0">
leads us to think that it chiefly re&s;ides in a re&s;in. The more heat is applied in the extraction, the Bitter will be more di&s;agreeable, and by boiling, the whole of the e&s;&s;ential oil will be di&s;&s;ipated. It is true the more pure Bitter &s;till remains; but I think it very doubtful whether al&s;o &s;ome virtue does not depend on the Aroma, united with the Bitter. In extracting the&s;e Bitters we want to &s;hun their di&s;|agreeablene&s;s. Spirit, without de&s;troying the quality, renders the Bitter more agreeable; water renders it more har&s;h, and wine, tho' rather a watery than a &s;pirituous men&s;truum, yet here corrects the Bitterne&s;s; but whether without changing the virtue is not certain. All the fo&s;&s;ile acids, in a very &s;mall quantity, de&s;troy Bit|ters. Perhaps it is from the acid in wine, acting in this manner, that it mitigates the nau&s;eous ta&s;te of the Bitter. For my part, I think it very doubtful, whether acids are well employed in extract|ing acrid &s;ub&s;tances. The very &s;trong Squill may &s;till retain its properties, but this will &s;carcely apply to others. Alkali, too, is &s;ometimes added, but contributes nothing to the extraction; for the &s;ame colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is procured by adding alkali to the common &s;olu|tion after it is made, as before.

<HEAD>2. WINE.</HEAD>
<P>The di&s;ti&s;tingui&s;hing property of that part of the <HI>Mu&s;t</HI> which is converted into Wine, is, that it now contains an Alcohol, at lea&s;t it is that on which the chief effects of the pure vinous part, which I &s;aid was in Wine, depends. On this head, therefore, we mu&s;t con|&s;ider the effects of Alcohol. 1. Alcohol applied to the fluids, co|agulates them; 2. to the &s;olids, con&s;tricts and hardens them; and hence, in &s;topping Haemorrhages, may act in either way. Applied either to the fluids &s;uddenly, or injected into the ve&s;&s;els of living ani|mals, in &s;mall quantity, it will produce death. 3. In the &s;tomach, its chemical effects on the fluids and &s;olids may almo&s;t be neglected; nor can we &s;uppo&s;e, with Boerhaave, that, carried thence into the ve&s;&s;els of animals, it can be &s;ubject to tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold, producing conden&s;ation and rarefaction, and thus unequal compre&s;&s;ions, and thence di&s;ea&s;es. Alcohol diluted, lo&s;es that &s;trong power to generate heat; it mu&s;t al&s;o lo&s;e its coagulating powers, di|luted in the blood ve&s;&s;els. Alcohol, internally, acts on the nervous &s;y&s;tem purely, chiefly by means of the &s;tomach. In &s;mall do&s;es it &s;imply &s;timulates, increa&s;es the action of the heart and ve&s;&s;els, in|crea&s;es the nervous flow over the whole of the &s;y&s;tem, whence more &s;erenity and ea&s;e of mind, more clearne&s;s and liveline&s;s of imagination, and the vigorous exertion of every faculty. In large do&s;es it has a contrary effect; it de&s;troys the mobility of the nervous power, in interrupting its flow from the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune;</HI> whence from its &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ative and &s;timulant effects mixed, it produces confu&s;ion of ideas and delirium; if the do&s;es are &s;till repeated, the nervous flow is arre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, the voluntary and involuntary motions are de&s;troyed,

In Wines them&s;elves, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t &s;tage, the effects are almo&s;t never &s;o violent, for the Wine is nece&s;|&s;arily thrown in more dilute at fir&s;t, and in &s;maller do&s;es, and has, in a manner, the con&s;equence of one do&s;e di&s;&s;ipated, before another is repeated, and therefore is more &s;timulant, and rai&s;es the &s;pirits more. It does produce &s;tupor, but &s;eldom death; for be&s;ides it being more dilute, from its &s;timulant qualities it is apt to be thrown up from the &s;tomach, and again has, by the other matters in it, the powers of the Alcohol moderated. Whether the <HI>Mu&s;t, Acid,</HI> and <HI>Alcohol</HI> are all in every Wine, I &s;hall not determine. Certain it is, that if any body were to drink of pure Alcohol as much as they can drink of Wine, in proportion to the &s;trength it would have deleterious effects. Alcohol is more inflammatory too, and productive of an inflamma|tory diathe&s;is, than Wine, becau&s;e of the acid, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> accompanying the latter. A proof of this is, that Punch, which is an artificial Wine, is le&s;s noxious than the &s;ame quantity of diluted Alcohol. Some|thing al&s;o depends on the accuracy of mixture, for Punch, tho' le&s;s noxious than Alcohol, is more &s;o than Wine. Hence I imagine it is a very bad practice to mix Alcohol with fermented Wines; for though it is better than Punch, and by very long dige&s;tion may be po&s;&s;ibly mixed accurately with the Wine, yet it is far le&s;s &s;afe than the &s;ame quantity of &s;pirit, gained by the vinous liquors them&s;elves, during their fermentation.</P>

<HEAD>3. ACID.</HEAD>
<P>The Acid of Wines may be con&s;idered as of two kinds; 1.

That which is generated, from part of the vinous liquor going on to the acetous proce&s;s more copiou&s;ly and more &s;eparate, then called Vinegar. This renders the Wine m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e grateful to the palate, &s;timulates the mucous glands, and quenches thir&s;t; and in the &s;tomach, by obviating putrefaction, exerts &s;ome|what of the &s;ame quality.

mixed body, at lea&s;t on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, containing, be&s;ides the Acid, a part of unconverted, &s;accharine matter. As containing &s;uch, it may be laxative in the inte&s;tines, have the effect of unconverted <HI>Mu&s;t,</HI> generate <HI>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;ylve&s;tre</HI> in the inte&s;tines, and, in &s;hort, have all the properties of fre&s;h juice. When thoroughly converted, it acts in another manner. By the quantity of Acid, it determines other vegetables to ace&s;cency, weakening the &s;tomach, and, therefore, hurtful to &s;uch as have their health very much depending on the tone of that organ in arthritic and hypochondriac ca&s;es. This cool|ing quality in vinegar may go &s;o far as to imitate the effects of the <HI>gas &s;ylve&s;tre,</HI> prove &s;pa&s;modic, and have all the con&s;equences of Acid, generated in the &s;tomach it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In &s;o far as Wine contains Vinegar, or <HI>Mu&s;t,</HI> it is not perfect; but it is unavoidable but that in every Wine we have, they &s;hould be more or le&s;s pre&s;ent. In the combined &s;tate of the&s;e qualities in Wine, they are much more innocent than we have de&s;cribed them as &s;eparate; the Alcohol and Vinegar obviate the fermentation of the <HI>Mu&s;t,</HI> the &s;timulant of the Alcohol obviates the cooling quality of the Vinegar, and this again, with the <HI>Mu&s;t,</HI> the inflammatory con&s;equences of the Alcohol. There is in Wine a fourth ingredient, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Water, which, according to its proportion, moderates the other qualities.</P>
<P>In many countries weak Wine is u&s;ed as common drink, without any bad con&s;equences. For my part, I imagine it has con&s;iderable advantages, tending to obviate the ace&s;cency of vegetable aliment, as we &s;ee in &s;trong Wines, taken with ace&s;cent fruits, and more univer&s;ally the putre&s;cency of the animal diet. Hence, I imagine, dilute Wine is not improperly employed in tho&s;e countries where the food is chiefly animal, as obviating its noxious tendency, and promoting the excretion of the putre&s;cent parts of our food. As u&s;ed with aliment, Phy&s;icians have, indeed, con&s;idered Wine as di|luent, and moderately &s;timulating; as anti&s;eptic, and promoting the
<PB N="313" REF="014000_0319_0F928AA9A7E1D6C0">

<P>As a medicine, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the effects of Wine in its differ|ent kinds, for according to the kind of Wine, mu&s;t its effects be diver&s;ified.</P>

The effects of the&s;e will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood, but it is often very dif|ficult to be able to know the&s;e &s;tates of Wine, for the Merchant takes every method of concealing them. We &s;hall now &s;ay &s;ome|what on the different qualities of Wines.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sweet and Sharp.</HI> Sweetne&s;s in Wines may depend on the natural richne&s;s of the grape, its maturity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but much more com|monly is it the effect of imperfect fermentation, from racking off the vinous liquor from the lees, as &s;oon as the fermentation is tole|rably active, into new ve&s;&s;els &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, till once it be checked, and a &s;weetne&s;s remain. Such are the Spani&s;h and Italian Wines. Sweetne&s;s al&s;o may ari&s;e from the Vintner mixing with &s;harp Wines a quantity of unfermented <HI>Mu&s;t.</HI> The qualities are ea&s;ily under|&s;tood. Where the &s;weetne&s;s, or rather crudene&s;s of the Wine, de|pends on the quantity of <HI>Mu&s;t</HI> pre&s;ent, it will have the &s;ame effects as <HI>Mu&s;t,</HI> generate <HI>gas &s;ylve&s;tre,</HI> prove laxative, purgative, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Where the &s;weetne&s;s depends on the native richne&s;s of the grape, the bad effects will be obviated by the greater quantity of Alcohol, as in Canary and Tokay. But even in the&s;e, I am per&s;uaded the richne&s;s of the juice, and the vi&s;cidity attending it, prevent the generation of as much Alcohol as might be produced; and accordingly we find that the&s;e Wines have always a good deal of the effect of crude Wine.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="014000_0320_0F928AAC18936990">
<HI>Sharp Wines</HI> may have that property from different cau&s;es; 1. From the nature of the grape, to be judged of according to the climate. Thus the Wines of the Northern countries po&s;&s;e&s;s this property more than tho&s;e of the Southern. 2. Sharpne&s;s, whatever be the &s;tate of the grape, ari&s;es from every active fer|mentation. 3. Sharpne&s;s may proceed from Wines being kept long, and partly converted into vinegar. In one ca&s;e, then, you &s;ee, Sharpne&s;s is a &s;ymptom of weak Wine, and, therefore, of a cooling, le&s;s heating, and le&s;s inflammatory liquor. In healthy &s;tomachs the&s;e may be more freely indulged, and prove good con|diments for animal food, and likely to prove diuretic and anti|&s;eptic. When the Sharpne&s;s proceeds from an unfini&s;hed active fermentation, the&s;e Wines may be hurtful, as too cooling, and as debilitating the &s;tomach, and thus produce arthritic and nephritic paroxy&s;ms, and <HI>haemorrhoidal pains,</HI> which al&s;o depends very much on the &s;tomach's tone.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Bri&s;k and Flat; i. e.</HI> more or le&s;s poignant. 1. Flatne&s;s of Wines may depend on the want of a due degree of fermentation. 2. Flatne&s;s may proceed from too great ripene&s;s, or mellowne&s;s, and the Wine encrea&s;ing in age. Thus Wine kept long in well corked bottles, not having the air nece&s;&s;ary for the acetous proce&s;s, turns &s;imply vapid. 3. When artificial means is u&s;ed to prevent fermentation, it will induce flatne&s;s, as brandy mixed with Wines. Hence the flatne&s;s of the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e Wines, in compa|ri&s;on of the French.</P>
<P>Bri&s;kne&s;s al&s;o alone proceeds from an active fermentation pre|&s;ent, and always implies more or le&s;s of a crude &s;tate; whence, though more agreeable, it is more dangerous. A di&s;tinction of Wines is made into tho&s;e which are apt to affect the nerves and the head, and tho&s;e which produce fever. Champaign, from u&s;ing it flowering in the cup, is very apt to intoxicate. Experi|enced dinkers have a rule for this; rejecting &s;uch Champaign as retains its flower long in the cup.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="315" REF="014000_0321_0F928AAD986898A0">
3. <HI>Strong and Weak.</HI> The&s;e are compatible with the various other qualities, but entirely depend on the quantity of alcohol. All wines are, in &s;ome degree, heating and inflammatory, but their property in the&s;e re&s;pects is not entirely to be mea&s;ured from the quantity of alcohol. The &s;ame quantity of Wine diluted, intoxi|cates &s;ooner than the &s;ame quantity drank in the &s;ame time with|out that dilution; at lea&s;t this is a common ob&s;ervation of drinkers. The rea&s;on &s;eems to be this, that the Wine, by this means, is applied to a larger &s;urface in the &s;tomach, and its dilution cau&s;es a quicker diffu&s;ion over the &s;y&s;tem. Some have endeavoured to explain this from the bulk of liquor in the &s;tomach, but I cannot conceive it in that way. Though Wines thus diluted are, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> &s;ooner intoxicating, yet their effects are al&s;o &s;ooner over. With regard to the quick diffu&s;ion, it is ob&s;erved, too, that the Wine which provokes urine &s;oone&s;t, is al&s;o the &s;ooner intoxicating; which proceeds plainly from its being applied to a larger portion of the &s;y&s;tem. For whatever other purpo&s;es Wines are wanted, ei|ther as diluent, diuretic, or anti&s;eptic, the weake&s;t are always to be preferred. Wine, you will now &s;ee, like Opium, has a double effect. In &s;trong Wines both the &s;timulant and narcotic qualities are in a high degree, and, therefore, in the&s;e, there can be no &s;afety; but in weak wine we are &s;afe, becau&s;e with the&s;e we can more ea|&s;ily &s;top, before the narcotic effects are exerted.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Smooth and Rough.</HI> Smoothne&s;s depends on the &s;weetne&s;s or mellowne&s;s, except where it is mi&s;taken for flatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Roughne&s;s depends, 1. On the natural acidity and want of &s;ugar in the juice; 2. On the unripe &s;tate of the juice. At fir&s;t the fruit is of a hard cellular texture, which is filled fir&s;t in the middle with a fluid, which gradually extends over the fruit; &s;o that within the center is always ripe&s;t.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Colour of Wines.</HI> Colour depends very little on the juice of the grape, the red grape, I am well a&s;&s;ured, affording a Wine equally tran&s;parent with the naturally white. When a red Wine is wanted, the red hu&s;ks are thrown in, &s;o that, <HI>caeteris paribus</HI> the red Wines are more a&s;tringent. Here we are apt to be deceived. White Wines are rejected when brown and rough, which they grow by age; hence the merchant dies them red, in which kind of Wines &s;uch qualities are expected. Sometimes al&s;o, the &s;ame practice is performed, from a greater demand at market.

<HEAD>REMARKS on the WINES of different Countries.</HEAD>
<P>The Wines of the Northern climates are generally of a weak body, more acid, and of a more &s;harp ta&s;te, and affording a larger proportion of tartar. The rea&s;on of their greater acidity is ea&s;ily under&s;tood. With regard to the tartar of Wines, we have not yet &s;poken of it. Tartar accompanies &s;harpne&s;s and au&s;terity, and thence its effects are to be under&s;tood. Though tartar be a pur|gative, yet in any quantity we drink Wines, they cannot, from
<PB N="317" REF="014000_0323_0F928AAF044CEBF0">
the tartar, be more active, or exert their purgative quality. Their laxative virtue is owing to the ace&s;cent Wine mixing with the bile. It has been alledged, that tartarous Wines are apt to produce the Stone in the kidneys; but neither theory nor experience proves this. There is not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance between the &s;tones, and the tartar in their nature, and Hoffman tells us, that tho&s;e who drink Rheni&s;h Wine were rather freer of it than the others. Hence, then, the qualities of the&s;e Wines depends chiefly on their weak|ne&s;s and acidity, and from the&s;e qualities their virtues may be un|der&s;tood. Of this kind are the Mo&s;elle, Rheni&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Southern Wines are &s;trong, &s;weet, and unctuous. The Hungarian Wines, <HI>e. g.</HI> Tokay, are &s;uppo&s;ed the be&s;t at pre&s;ent. The Canaries, though more Southern, do not afford Wines &s;o rich as the former. The rea&s;on &s;eems to be, that being in&s;ular, the grape is expo&s;ed to the cooling breezes of the &s;ea. Madeira is the growth of a warm climate; but from an accidental ta&s;te, which prevails at pre&s;ent, a particular management of it has been intro|duced. In Madeira there are mountains upon which they can grow Wines as weak as tho&s;e of the Northern climates. The&s;e, as more ace&s;cent, are more grateful, but, at the &s;ame time, more dangerous. In order to tran&s;portation, they have a quantity of alcohol mixed with them, and after that, to gain a proper degree of activity, require to be kept, for &s;ome time, in the warmer climates.</P>
<P>The Italian Wines, as Southern, &s;hould be &s;trong but from their being checked in the fermentation, are &s;weet and weak. They come over to us in fla&s;ks, covered with oil, and cannot be kept above a year.</P>

Champaign is in active fermentation, and not &s;o &s;afe as the mellow Burgundy, but this formerly, from being imported in fla&s;ks, was never properly mellowed, and was very heady. This practice is now prohibited, and we have a Wine le&s;s delicate, but more &s;afe, particularly to the nerves.

they cannot be given, but in &s;mall do&s;es. In large do&s;es their effects might appear general on the &s;y&s;tem; but as we manage them, even in pretty large do&s;es, they affect the urinary pa&s;&s;ages only, very little the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem. To me it &s;eems very cu|rious, that thus, without affecting the <HI>primae viae,</HI> they &s;hould only exert their action on a more di&s;tant part of the &s;y&s;tem. The rea&s;on &s;eems to be this. In the <HI>primae viae</HI> they are con&s;tantly and equally diffu&s;ed through the whole ma&s;s of matter contained there, which is in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ufficient to obviate the effect of <HI>Cantha|rides,</HI> which mu&s;t be given in a great mea&s;ure concentrated. In their farther progre&s;s in the blood, they are &s;till more diffu&s;ed, and thence &s;till unactive, but from their connection to a particular por|tion of the blood; they are again collected in their concentrated form, in the kidneys, and con&s;equently there exert their effects. In proof that it is thus from its dilution, it does not act on the other parts of the body, even in the kidneys, if it is exhibited very weak. I have known half a grain of <HI>Cantharides</HI> bring on a &s;trangury, and yet if this &s;ame half grain was diluted in much water, <HI>e. g.</HI> it would have no effect at all. Hence it is very difficult to do&s;e them pro|perly. When carried to the kidneys, they &s;timulate them, prove di|uretic, and hence are recommended in drop&s;ies. Even here their dilution may in &s;ome mea&s;ure account for their not &s;ucceeding, and if that be not the ca&s;e, they then are found &s;ooner to affect the neck of the bladder, than to prove diuretic. Upon the &s;ame footing, they have been u&s;ed in nephritic ca&s;es. It is very doubtful whether Di|uretics there are proper at all. Surely tho&s;e which are inflamma|tory will be prejudicial. Any effect they exert internally, is, I imagine, from their common enough action on the neck of the bladder and urethra. By inducing an inflammation there, they cure Gleets. This I have formerly &s;hewn, under the Bal&s;amics, to be a fact, in whatever method it be explained. Whatever method has been recommended in the <HI>Gonorrhoea benigna,</HI> has been al&s;o recom|mended in the <HI>Fluor albus.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re, from the contiguity of the parts, it may act in the &s;ame manner we have mentioned; but to extend that effect, the inflammation in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages mu&s;t be &s;o great, as to

make their exhibition very inconvenient. As diruetic they may be &s;uppo&s;ed diaphoretic, and hence probably have been recommended in cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, as in the <HI>Lepra</HI> by Dr. Mead. I have &s;een them exhibited in this di&s;ea&s;e without any good con&s;equence. This, however, does not contradict their diaphoretic virtue. I imagine the <HI>Lepra</HI> is a topical di&s;ea&s;e, yielding little to internal remedies, but chiefly to tho&s;e applied to the part, as bathing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As diuretic and diaphoretic, <HI>Cantharides</HI> have been &s;uppo&s;ed pectoral. The only ca&s;e of this kind, in which I know they have been tried, is the Chin-cough, in which Dr. Burton propo&s;ed them. As in the &s;ame compo&s;ition was joined the Bark and Camphire to correct the <HI>Cantharides,</HI> I ea&s;ily &s;aw the Bark was the &s;ub&s;tance on who&s;e virtue the medicine depended, and therefore u&s;ed it alone. Other prac|titioners of my acquaintance took the pre&s;cription as it &s;tood, and found them&s;elves expo&s;ed to all the inconveniencies of <HI>Cantharides,</HI> without obtaining any other good effect than what was got by the Bark alone. The&s;e, then, are the virtues of <HI>Cantharides,</HI> which you &s;ee are very precarious. As to their effects on the &s;kin, we mu&s;t take notice of them when we come to other &s;ub&s;tances which po&s;|&s;e&s;s the &s;ame property.</P>
<P>As to the manner of exhibiting <HI>Cantharides</HI> &s;everal doubts have ari&s;en, which &s;eem &s;till to remain. As to the antient opinion, of the &s;everal parts of the fly being mutual antidotes, that I di&s;regard, and cannot at pre&s;ent decide. A more important di&s;qui&s;ition is, to determine whether they ought to be given in &s;ub&s;tance or &s;olution. In &s;ub&s;tance they may po&s;&s;ibly be given in larger quantity, be gra|dually extracted, and gradually (and perhaps more &s;ucce&s;sfully) dif|fu&s;ed over the &s;y&s;tem. On the other hand, they are &s;o ea&s;ily ex|tracted, that we cannot tru&s;t much to this; and po&s;&s;ibly the com|mon method of giving them in &s;olution an&s;wers better. For the wa|tery or &s;pirituous men&s;truum an&s;wers equally well. In what &s;ub&s;tance, whether re&s;inous or gummy, their virtues con&s;i&s;t, is not decided; neither, indeed, is it accurately of any other animal or vegetable &s;ub|&s;tance; neither is it known whether &s;olution does not decompound

them. With regard to all the do&s;e is undetermined. This mu&s;t depend on the &s;tate of the body, on the greater quantity of mucus in the kidney, the quantity of urine naturally &s;ecreted, or at the particular time in which <HI>Cantharides</HI> are given. We &s;hould begin with &s;mall do&s;es, as five drops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and increa&s;e them, till once they affect the urinary pa&s;&s;ages. The &s;imple London Tincture is preferable to the Edinburgh, in which, indeed, the &s;ub&s;tances added agree with the intention, but in the pre&s;ent form cannot be given in &s;uch quantity as to have any effect.</P>

<HEAD>SEDATIVA.</HEAD>
<P>Sedatives are &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as dimini&s;h motions in the &s;y&s;tem, and the force of the moving power. There is a di&s;tinction between the&s;e two, which is not ea&s;y to be made, &s;eeing we &s;uppo&s;e the la&s;t always to take place. Sedatives may either dimini&s;h motion in a part, or in the whole of the &s;y&s;tem. In this view, blood-letting is a Sedative, as taking off ten&s;ion; but at pre&s;ent I am only to con&s;ider &s;uch Sedatives as act particularly upon our nervous power, which can, by medicines, have its mobility entirely de&s;troyed. Their operation on the nervous &s;y&s;tem is not ea&s;y to determine, and as to their ultimate effect, I &s;hall not endeavour to explain it. We know very little of the nervous power, having nothing analogous to it in nature, at lea&s;t nothing exhibiting analogous effects; for though the powers of the &s;en&s;itive plant &s;eem &s;omewhat of the &s;ame nature, yet they give us no analogy with regard to the operation of medi|cines. However, by enquiring into this &s;ubject, we may di&s;|cover &s;ome laws of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, and di&s;cu&s;s &s;ome que&s;tions which have ari&s;en on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion we &s;hall take notice of is, Whether the action of Sedatives be mediate or immediate? From my definition you will &s;ee I have a&s;&s;umed the la&s;t, but others are of a different opi|nion. It is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, that the motion of the &s;everal parts of the body depend on an influx derived from the <HI>Sen&s;orium.</HI> This once being given, we can ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that when the blood is rari|fied,
<PB N="324" REF="014000_0330_0F928AB727CF2598">
and di&s;tending the ve&s;&s;els of the brain, it may compre&s;s the origin of the nerves, and impede the influx of the nervous power. Hence &s;ome have imagined, that Sedatives act by rarifying the blood. Others again have adopted a contrary opinion, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that Sedatives act by inducing a coagulation or vi&s;co&s;ity in the blood, whence the &s;ecretion in the brain is de&s;troyed. We may di&s;cu&s;s both the&s;e opinions together; 1. We conclude Sedatives do not act mediately, from the &s;mallne&s;s of the do&s;e required to produce their effect, no medicine in &s;uch &s;mall quantity acting on our fluids, ex|cept in the way of a ferment. 2. Sedatives act after the circula|tion is taken away, and Dr. Whytt has &s;hewn, that after the heart is taken out, Opium has the &s;ame effect as before, in &s;topping the motion of the &s;y&s;tem, which bani&s;hes altogether the notion of Seda|tives acting on the blood. 3. Farther, the quick operation of &s;ome poi&s;ons &s;hews, that medicines, confined to the &s;tomach, can act on the nervous powers, and be extended over the &s;y&s;tem, without any ab&s;orption into the blood. I need not here mention experiments where the&s;e effects have en&s;ued, and the medicine been found to con&s;trict both its orifices. Whether the effects, on the nervous &s;y&s;tem does not produce changes in the fluids, I &s;hall not deny. It is that probably which has given ri&s;e to the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>The immediate action of Sedatives on the nervous power being proved, we proceed to a &s;econd que&s;tion, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Whether Sedatives act on the nerves to which they are applied, or whether more di|rectly on the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune?</HI> Although we acknowledge a <HI>Sen|&s;orium commune,</HI> or prime mover, yet I think it is &s;ufficiently proved, that the nervous power is pre&s;ent in every part of the animal body during life; and that, independent of any new afflux, a motion may be excited; and therefore Sedatives act primarily on the part to which they are applied. There are enough of experiments to &s;hew, that the heart, &s;eparated from the body, retains its mobility for &s;ome time after the &s;eparation, will even palpitate of it&s;elf, can have its motion renewed by Stimuli, and its mobility de&s;troyed by Sedatives&punc; it is probable, then, the Sedatives act on the part to which they are
<PB N="325" REF="014000_0331_0F928AB7E69D48D0">
applied, and thence propagate their effects to other parts of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, mo&s;t ea&s;ily to the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune.</HI> It has been a&s;ked, whether Sedatives act on the &s;tomach? there is no doubt of it; but the&s;e effects appear in tho&s;e parts which con&s;ent mo&s;t with the &s;tomach, and mo&s;t ea&s;ily in the common origin.</P>
<P>Sedatives, acting on the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune,</HI> exert their power in two ways; 1. In de&s;troying the mobility of the nervous fluid there, and &s;o de&s;troying its afflux to the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem; 2. By de&s;troy|ing the mobility in the extreme parts, and &s;o making a re&s;i&s;tance to the impul&s;e from the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune,</HI> and con&s;equently making it incapable to receive impre&s;&s;ion. I can &s;ee in&s;tances where it is proper to make this di&s;tinction. Thus I think cold undoubtedly acts on the extreme nerves, de&s;troys the mobility in the&s;e, and at la&s;t &s;huts up the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In order to the univer&s;al action of Sedatives in the &s;y&s;tem, their effects mu&s;t be exerted in the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune.</HI> But here &s;uch effects are found to be very unequal, the rea&s;on of which we mu&s;t now endeavour to explain. This difference of effect &s;eems to be varied, 1. according to the proximity of the part; 2. According to the Stimulus to which it is expo&s;ed; 3. According to the habit induced.</P>
<P N="1">1.

Upon a compari&s;on with different copies, this &s;eems to be the meaning: <Q>The nervous power is, <HI>cae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eris paribus,</HI> weake&s;t in tho&s;e parts which are mo&s;t di&s;tant from the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune.</HI> Hence, whenever any cau&s;e operates on the <HI>Sen&s;orium</HI> in &s;uch a manner as to dimini&s;h its influence on the re&s;t of the body, the effects will appear mo&s;t evident in the extremities, as being the parts which, on account of their di&s;tance, have the &s;light<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> connection with it. Thus Sedatives &s;hew their action by inducing a Pal&s;y of the lower extremities. But the rever&s;e is true in the ca&s;e of medicines that excite and encrea&s;e the action of the <HI>Sen&s;orium</HI> upon the body. Here the parts &s;ituated neare&s;t to the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune</HI> &s;oone&s;t partake of its affections. From this con&s;ideration, we are furni&s;hed with a method of terminating a di&s;pute among authors concerning the nature of Convul&s;ions. It has been a &s;ubject of controver&s;y, whether they ari&s;e from affections of the <HI>Sen&s;orium</HI> only; or from irritations of particular portions of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, made in the different parts of the body? Both ca&s;es, in my opinion, occur, and are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed; in the one, by the Con|vul&s;ion beginning in the extremities, and gradually &s;preading over the different parts, till they reach the <HI>Sen&s;orium;</HI> in the other, by the Convul&s;ions beginning in the mu&s;cles of the face, and extending from thence to the re&s;t of the body.</Q> The re&s;t of the paragraph is ea&s;y and clear.</NOTE>.

The &s;ecretory &s;y&s;tem to me appears to be a di&s;tinct portion from that of the heart and ve&s;&s;els, though conti|guous to them, for they are very often differently affected. Nerves enter into the &s;ecretory organs, which are not continued from tho&s;e of the ve&s;&s;els; each particular &s;ecretory has Stimuli, that act in a particular manner upon it, without affecting the &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els: Motion is &s;ometimes de&s;troyed in the &s;ecretories, without affecting the heart and ve&s;&s;els: The principal &s;timulus to the &s;ecretories is that on their excretories, by which not only the excretion, but the &s;ecretion is encrea&s;ed, without affecting the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem; as in &s;ucking, or even handling a nur&s;e's nipples, by which not only will the excretion for the time be encrea&s;ed, but the &s;ecretion afterwards. Again, in the encrea&s;ed action of the heart and ve&s;&s;els there is no &s;ecretion but that of &s;weat encrea&s;ed. All the&s;e di&s;tinct effects are to be ob&s;erved, and perhaps are depending on the head we are now treating of.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This paragraph is intended to prove, that the action of Sedatives on any part is always varied in proportion to the degree of Stimulus to which that part is expo&s;ed. This it does pretty clearly; but there are &s;everal things in it, of which I cannot di&s;cern the con|nection with the re&s;t of the &s;ubject. I have, therefore, copied this paragraph from another manu&s;cript, which, though likewi&s;e ob&s;cure, may, perhaps, &s;erve to make it &s;omewhat more plain.</P>
<P><Q>The inequality of the action of Sedatives likewi&s;e depends upon the degree of Stimulus to which the parts are expo&s;ed. Thus the heart and lungs are con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to Stimulus; in con&s;equence of which their actions are but little affected by Sedatives operating on the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune,</HI> while tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem are de&s;troyed. Authors, indeed, have endeavoured to explain this effect from the different &s;ource of the nerves here affected. They tell us, that the nerves, by which the vital functions are car|ried on, ari&s;e from the <HI>Cerebellum;</HI> while tho&s;e which govern the other functions are derived immediately from the Brain. Whether this explanation might not be urged with &s;ome degree of plau&s;ibility in the ca&s;e of Apoplexy, is a different que&s;tion; but &s;urely in the ca&s;e of &s;leep, and in the action of Sedatives, no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why an affection of the one can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without that of the other. Add to this, that Dr. Haller has demon&s;trated that the nerves of the vital functions are not, as was generally &s;uppo&s;ed, di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem; and you will hardly require any thing further to per&s;uade you, that the explanation we have delivered is by much the more probable, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that a Stimulus being con&s;tantly applied to the vital organs, and only occa&s;ionally to the voluntary ones, the latter are much more readily and con&s;iderably affected than the former. From hence it follows, that whenever we would wi&s;h to have the full effect of any &s;edative medicine, care &s;hould be taken that every thing which acts on the organs of &s;en&s;e, every thought which affects the involuntary motion, &s;hould be removed. It may be doubted, indeed, how far this la&s;t is practicable. It has been alledged that the &s;oul always thinks. Not to enter into the &s;ubtilty of this di&s;pute, we may content our&s;elves with alledging, that we are not con&s;cious of it, at lea&s;t, in healthful &s;leep. Dreams occur only in con&s;equence of <HI>Stimuli,</HI> and hence do not &s;o frequently happen in the fir&s;t part of &s;leep, as towards the latter end, when, from a re|tention of the &s;everal &s;ecretions, an accumulation takes place, which gives the Stimulus. Of dreams there &s;ub&s;i&s;ts all the po&s;&s;ible degrees that can take place between the &s;y&s;tem's being perfectly awake, and buried in the mo&s;t profound &s;leep. Of the &s;lighte&s;t kind, or tho&s;e which recede lea&s;t from a &s;tate of perfect wakefulne&s;s, are the <HI>Somnambulantes.</HI> It is remarkable with what &s;teadine&s;s they perform their actions. The rea&s;on of which is, that their attention is not di&s;tracted by a number of objects, as in the time of wakeful|ne&s;s; be&s;ides, being ignorant of the dangerous &s;ituation in which they frequently are, they are wholly dive&s;ted of fear, and, therefore, pay a calm and undi&s;turbed attention to the thing about which they happen to be employed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But for the mo&s;t part dreams are extravagantly wild and incoherent. That they generally bear &s;ome conformity to our waking thoughts is acknowledged, and this happens &s;o frequently, that when we cannot di&s;cern it, we ought neverthele&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e it. For our thoughts in dreams not depending on the action of bodies on our external &s;en&s;es, but on internal <HI>Stimuli,</HI> tho&s;e ideas will generally be excited, of which there are at that time the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions in the mind. The&s;e are &s;uch as have been the &s;ubject of our contemplation the preceding day, which, being more recent, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have their impre&s;&s;ion much clearer and &s;tronger than any other. But then they are irregularly and extravagantly combined; becau&s;e that power, by which the mind thinks and judges clearly, requires for its exertion a free and undi&s;turbed <HI>Sen&s;orium,</HI> which in dreams, being partly free and partly ob&s;tructed, occa&s;ions this irregularity. This partial ob&s;truction is likewi&s;e the cau&s;e of the incoherence of our ideas in delirium, which differs from dreams in this, that here the organs of &s;en&s;e are awake. We have commonly thought the application of a Stimulus to the brain &s;ufficient to excite a delirium; but we &s;hall afterwards &s;ee, that this will not do without an ob&s;truction of the <HI>Sen&s;orium.</HI> And accordingly we more frequently cure a delirium by means that remove the ob&s;truc|tion, than tho&s;e that take off the Stimulus.</Q> The conformity between the copies is now &s;o great, that I have omitted to copy the re&s;t of this paragraph.</P></NOTE> 2. The effects of Sedatives, or other medicines acting on the <HI>Sen&s;orium,</HI> depend on the expo&s;ure of the parts to &s;timulus. Thus the heart and lungs have their motions entire, while tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem are de&s;troyed. It has been &s;aid, that the nerves of the&s;e differ, and that in &s;uch ca&s;es tho&s;e of the former are not affected. In Apoplexy this la&s;t may be &s;ometimes the ca&s;e; but &s;urely in the ca&s;e of &s;leep, and of &s;edative medicines, no &s;uch diffe|rence is to be ob&s;erved; and be&s;ides, Dr. Haller has demon&s;trated, that the nerves of the animal and vital functions are the &s;ame, and
<PB N="328" REF="014000_0334_0F928ABA252FE1D8">
not di&s;tinct as was imagined. Much more properly is the continu|ation of motion in the&s;e to be a&s;cribed to the Stimulus to which they are expo&s;ed. Accordingly we &s;ee, that this effect is not confined to the heart and lungs, but extended to other parts, in proportion to the Stimulus to which they are expo&s;ed. Thus any part of the alimentary canal can be brought into action from the Stimulus of the food, and, in &s;hort, by &s;uch means, any one part can be kept in motion inde|pendent of any other part, notwith&s;tanding the action of Sedatives, or of &s;leep, and all this from the &s;timulus applied to it. Thus, in
<PB N="329" REF="014000_0335_0F928AC050EF3480">
order to the action of &s;leep, or Sedatives, every thing which acts on the organs of &s;en&s;e, every thought which affects the organs of voluntary motion, mu&s;t be removed. Whether the &s;oul always thinks, we cannot determine, at lea&s;t we are not con&s;cious of it in healthful &s;leep. Dreams always occur in con&s;equence of &s;timuli applied to particular parts, and hence, in the fir&s;t part of &s;leep, they are not &s;o apt to occur as in the morning, when accumulation gives &s;timulus. It is no wonder that the mind, occupied during the day, retains the impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;timuli it received at night, and therefore as we &s;ee dreams always depending upon &s;timulus, where &s;uch cannot be ob&s;erved, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e them. Again, the body can be in any degree of waking; and it is thus we mu&s;t account for the <HI>Somnambulantes.</HI> The &s;teadine&s;s of motion in &s;uch ca&s;es de|pends on the mind not being &s;en&s;ible to other impre&s;&s;ions, or &s;ti|muli, becau&s;e there is a total ab&s;ence of fear, and therefore a more exact and undi&s;turbed attention to the action we perform. I &s;hould have taken notice of the incoherence of our thoughts in dreams. That a&s;&s;ociation of Ideas on which judgment is formed, depends on the whole <HI>Sen&s;orium</HI> being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ree. When this, therefore, is at re&s;t in one part, and awake in another, wildne&s;s of thought mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily follow. Hence we can under&s;tand the nature of delirium, in which, in opp&s;ition to &s;leep, the greate&s;t part of the organs of &s;en&s;e, and the voluntary motions, can be performed, but in which there is an ob&s;truction in the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune.</HI> The incoherence of ideas in delirium depends upon the &s;ame cau&s;e as in &s;leep. We have commonly imagined delirium owing to a &s;timulus applied to the brain, but we &s;hall afterwards &s;ee that this will not do without re&s;i&s;tance, and accordingly we &s;ee delirium oftner removed by tak|ing off the re&s;i&s;tance, than by taking off the &s;timulus; by Anti|&s;pa&s;modics than by blood-letting. It is on the &s;timulus taken off that depends the ce&s;&s;ation of &s;ecretion and excretion, for the&s;e are always excited by the action of &s;timuli on the motion of the neigh|bouring parts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence we ea&s;ily &s;ee how a Salivation is &s;lopt by &s;leep and a Diarrhoea from the &s;ame, taking off the action of the parts, and dimini&s;hing the flow of the ga&s;tric and inte&s;tinal liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="330" REF="014000_0336_0F928AC1881E2BB8">
The &s;ecretion is &s;topt at the &s;ame time, in &s;o far as it depends on the excretion, as it often does.</P>
<P>The excretion of urine depends on the quantity pre&s;&s;ing on the neck of the bladder, and perhaps on the &s;timulus given by it. This bears a curious application. A &s;mall &s;tone falling into the neck of the bladder, by its irritation not allowing a &s;ufficient quantity of urine to be collected for dilating the neck of the bladder, hinders its own expul&s;ion; Opium given here cures the complaint, by taking off, for a time, the mind from the irritation, cau&s;ing an accumulation of urine, which, when the effects of the Opium are gone, by dilating the neck of the bladder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> expels the &s;tone.</P>
<P N="3">3. According to habit are the effects of Sedatives varied. Every motion may become habitual, and then acquire a greater force. From this, as well as the &s;timulus applied, are the lungs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> le&s;s affected than the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem. All periodical motions are diffi|cult to remove, and hence it is that Opium has a much greater effect at bed-time, than at any other hour, and this &s;hould give us a cau|tion both in the exhibiting Sedatives and Stimulants, which &s;hould always be given at the time when the motion or ce&s;&s;ation u&s;ually occurred, if we want to induce the&s;e. It has been thought danger|ous to exhibit Opiates during the men&s;trual flux, even although &s;pa&s;|modic motions &s;hould occur at that time; but I have found that Opiates may very &s;afely be given in &s;uch ca&s;es, and even as taking off the &s;pa&s;modic affections I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound them to encrea&s;e the excretion. However, I mu&s;t own that in &s;uch ca&s;es caution is required. Seda|tives are often u&s;eful in preventing the power of morbid habits, and, given before the fit of an Intermittent, I have &s;een them entirely prevent it.</P>
<P>All this explains the inequality of the effects of Sedatives on diffe|rent parts.</P>

<P>With regard to the different kinds, and extraction of this, I refer you to Dr. Al&s;ton's paper in the Medical E&s;&s;ays. Opium is one of the mo&s;t important articles of <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> a medicine of &s;uch con&s;iderable power, that it may prove deleterious, and de&s;troy the &s;y&s;tem altogether; and therefore always requiring great caution of exhibition. Not only have the ancients di&s;puted whether it was cold or hot, but we are at this moment di&s;puting whether it acts chiefly as a Stimulant, or whether in any ca&s;e it acts directly as a Seda|tive.(<HI>Vid.</HI> Tralles on Opium.) The&s;e doubts probably ari&s;e from the effects of Opium being mixed, and proving different, according to the do&s;e, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ime of exhibition, and the &s;tate of the patient. To throw &s;ome light upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall lay before you the phae|nomena which appear on the exhibition of Opium. This I take to be the mo&s;t difficult part of my ta&s;k, as the&s;e effects are much diver&s;ified.

Whether it may have different effects in di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons, or whether it may not be very much diver|&s;ified by different di&s;ea&s;es, are que&s;tions that remain to be decided by experience.</NOTE> Fir&s;t, a frequency of pul&s;e, after which the body is &s;en&s;ibly warmed, generally with a redne&s;s and flu&s;hing of the countenance. While the&s;e effects proceed, a &s;erenity of mind en&s;ues, and a lively imagination, which, when it occurs, is almo&s;t con&s;tantly of the chearful and plea&s;urable kind. To the&s;e in particular per&s;ons often &s;ucceed chagrin, irritability, and irra&s;cibility. By the time that the&s;e become remarkable, the &s;en&s;es appear imperfect, the imagi|nation fal&s;e, and directly a delirium takes place, and intoxication. The imperfection of the &s;en&s;es proceeds to a total want of &s;en&s;ibility, which end in &s;tupor and appearance of &s;leep. Under this &s;leep the pul&s;e is pretty con&s;tantly full and frequent, though varying in different per&s;ons. During the &s;leep a &s;weat takes place, while the other &s;ecretions are &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed. After this the per&s;on is awaked, and, if no other &s;timulus takes place, he is at|tended with a &s;en&s;e of coldne&s;s and weakne&s;s. Such is the &s;eries of the phaenomena, which plainly points out a mixture of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mulant and Sedative. The&s;e, as I &s;aid, will vary in different per&s;ons, according to the do&s;e. From this mixture of the &s;timulant and &s;edative properties the whole may be explained. 1. The &s;timulant power is exerted on the heart and larger ve&s;&s;els, whence the fre|quency of pul&s;e, heat, and flu&s;hing. Next the &s;timulant power is exerted on the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune.</HI> I mu&s;t be content here to &s;ay, and it may be demon&s;trated, that a free flow through the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune</HI> is always attended with &s;erenity of mind, in oppo&s;ition to chagrin, and that on the &s;ame free and equitable flow depends the lively, the chearful, and plea&s;urable imagination. The&s;e are the effects of the &s;timulant power, except &s;uch as pro|ceed from it in a &s;econdary way. As the &s;edative power takes
<PB N="333" REF="014000_0339_0F928AC3331CC338">
place, demon&s;trable changes follow, partly ari&s;ing from the encrea&s;ed re&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Sen&s;orium commune,</HI> partly from the increa&s;ed cir|culation producing tone and irritation, partly from the imperfect &s;en&s;e, and fal&s;e imagination. It is difficult to give an account of the rea&s;on of gaiety or &s;ullenne&s;s in different per&s;ons, and there|fore we &s;hall neglect it. The &s;edative &s;till mixing with the &s;timu|lant power, as in other ca&s;es, &s;o here produces delirium, which here, be&s;ide the re&s;i&s;tance given to the nervous power by the &s;e|dative, the &s;timulant &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, is owing al&s;o partly to the fal&s;e imagination. More directly owing to the &s;edative power are the Stupor and Sleep. During the Sleep, the fullne&s;s of the pul&s;e is owing to the accumulation in the larger ve&s;&s;els, and the laxity induced in them, the frequency of the pul&s;e to the &s;timulus of the Opium &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting un&s;ubdued by the &s;edative power. The &s;ame &s;edative power weakens the powers of &s;en&s;e and voluntary motion, by weakening the energy of the &s;en&s;orium. The &s;ecretions are dimini&s;hed from the di&s;tance, except &s;weat, which depends on increa&s;ed circulation.</P>
<P>From the &s;edative power prevailing, langour, coldne&s;s, weakne&s;s, and head-ach. If the &s;timulant power prevail, recurrence of fe|ver, inflammation and pain, e&s;pecially if any other &s;timuli are ur|gent in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>From what we have &s;aid, the effects (good and bad) of Opium may be under&s;tood. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that from the &s;timulant power of Opium, it may be an excellent cordial, though at the &s;ame time, when the &s;timulant power is great, or other &s;timuli &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the &s;y&s;tem, it will produce Fever and Inflammation. On the contrary, by its &s;edative power, it may be even u&s;ed to correct motion, except in the heart and ve&s;&s;els; that is, in fever. As its &s;edative power may de&s;troy motion entirely, &s;o al&s;o, in par|ticular ca&s;es, we may comprehend how it will induce debility. The&s;e are the principles upon which may be under&s;tood in what manner Opium is hurtful or &s;alutary in different di&s;ea&s;es. How|ever, I &s;hall proceed a little farther in detail.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="014000_0340_0F928AC431BEE0E8">
I chu&s;e fir&s;t to begin with the anodyne qualities of Opium as tending to explain the re&s;t. Pain may be con&s;idered as of three kinds, ari&s;ing from three different cau&s;es, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Di&s;ten&s;ion, Spa&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Irritation;</HI> from Di&s;ten&s;ion, more e&s;pecially of the inflammatory kind, as the Pleuri&s;y; from Spa&s;m, more frequently in the ali|mentary canal, as in Cholic; from Irritation, or acrid Stimulants applied, as in Cancers.</P>
<P N="1">1. In pain from inflammatory Di&s;ten&s;ion. As Opium, in its fir&s;t operation, encrea&s;es the circulation and impetus of the blood, and even in its la&s;t accumulates the blood in the larger ve&s;&s;els, and thus brings a &s;timulus to the heart, it mu&s;t increa&s;e inflammatory di&s;ten&s;ion. When given in &s;uch a large do&s;e as to lull the &s;en&s;es, as that its &s;edative effects do take place, yet as not removing the inflammatory di&s;ten&s;ion, or its cau&s;e, and as producing an accu|mulation in the larger ve&s;&s;els, and as thus cau&s;ing a &s;everer return of the pains, it mu&s;t be hurtful in this way al&s;o. In inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, which depend for their &s;olution on a particular excretion, as in the Pleuri&s;y, Opium, by checking this, prevents the only &s;afe and &s;alutary cri&s;is of the di&s;ea&s;e. From all this it is ea&s;ily un|der&s;tood, why Opium is hurtful in inflammatory pains. But there are &s;ome inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, which, though founded on an in|flammatory diathe&s;is, are apt to turn chronic, as the Rheumati&s;m. The acute Rheumati&s;m is always an inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e; the chronic much oftner than is imagined, and to be cured by the antiphlogi&s;tic method; &s;o that the u&s;e of Opium, in this di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t at be&s;t be doubtful. This will perhaps clear it up. In the ab&s;ence of fever, in pain of long &s;tanding, and confined to a parti|cular part, Opium may be employed for a temporary relief; but in no one in&s;tance does it contribute to the cure; nay, even in pains of the longe&s;t &s;tanding, and confined to the mo&s;t &s;ingle part, it will often be hurtful, by increa&s;ing the irritation; which gives us great caution as to the free u&s;e of it in &s;uch ca&s;es. It may be applied to a particular part with more &s;afety. This I imagine to be &s;ome foundation for the external u&s;e of the <HI>Cicuta</HI> being found
<PB N="335" REF="014000_0341_0F928AC4C1E14AF0">

of benefit in chronic Rheumati&s;ms. There is one in&s;tance of the external application of Opium having good effect, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in the Tooth-ach, which is a pain of the rheumatic kind, &s;ometimes ari&s;ing from inflammatory Di&s;ten&s;ion, &s;ometimes from Irritation. In the la&s;t, it is often u&s;eful, applied to the nerves of the part. Whether in the pure rheumatic Tooth-ach it &s;hould be employed, I am not certain. I have &s;een it of &s;ervice by de&s;troying the nerves of the part. To this head of inflammatory Di&s;ten&s;ion mu&s;t be re|ferred the u&s;e of Opium in the <HI>Gout.</HI> The pains occuring in the extremities, in this di&s;ea&s;e, are certainly of the inflammatory kind, and therefore Opium may be &s;uppo&s;ed to encrea&s;e the&s;e, which indeed I have &s;een it do, though in &s;o far it is &s;afe, as the health of the body depends on this inflammation. Whether we ought to proceed further, and take off the pain, has been much di&s;puted. The founder practitioners, as Sydenham, are ju&s;tly of opinion, that the more violent the pain the &s;horter is its duration, and le&s;s hurt|ful to the &s;y&s;tem. If the pain be &s;o violent as to overcome all patience, they admit Opium may be given; burthen it is very ju&s;tly added, that it is always with danger of the di&s;ea&s;e attacking other parts more violently; and I my&s;elf have &s;een in&s;tances of it. The rule then is this, that Opium ought not to be employed at the attack of the Gout, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> even at the height of the di&s;ea&s;e, except &s;ome violent &s;ymptom en&s;ue from mere irritation of pain. When the pains are gone, it may be given, but then, as weakening the tone of the &s;tomach, it debilitates that power upon which depends the healthy termination of the Gout. However, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that at the end of the di&s;ea&s;e, I have often &s;een good effects follow from it, re&s;toring the patient &s;oon to health, and preventing many an unea&s;y night. I have known al&s;o &s;ome who obtained the &s;ame effects from taking to a cour&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors immediately after the removal of the pains. I imagine, then, that if the &s;timu|lant effect of the Opium take place here without much of the &s;eda|tive, and at the &s;ame time as &s;weat is promoted, that the Opium will act chiefly as a &s;trengthener.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="014000_0342_0F928AC6C18E3950">
To this head of inflammatory Di&s;ten&s;ion mu&s;t be referred a &s;pe|cies of it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that which occurs in <HI>Suppuration,</HI> an immediate con&s;equence of Inflammation, but different from the fir&s;t &s;tage of it, of which we have &s;poken. The u&s;e of Opium here may be thought a contradiction to what we have &s;aid, but there is certainly a difference between this and Inflammation, although we do not know on what that difference depends. Practice &s;hews, that the pains ari&s;ing from Suppuration are not only properly and &s;afely allayed, but the Suppuration it&s;elf promoted by Opium. Certainly upon this is the u&s;e founded of Opium in the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> Did not experience and our own practice make it very evident, we might know, from that of Sydenham, the u&s;e of Opium in this di&s;ea&s;e; though, indeed, long ago it was em|ployed by the Arabians, in the &s;ame intention. Some doubts have lately ari&s;en with regard to Sydenham's practice in this di&s;|ea&s;e. It has been ob&s;erved, that Opium produced Co&s;tivene&s;s and Fever, dimini&s;hing the &s;ecretions, and encrea&s;ing the di&s;ten&s;ion and determination to the head. With many, the&s;e doubts have checked the u&s;e of Opium in the Small-pox altogether. Syden|ham takes no precaution to obviate the effects mentioned, and certainly there are &s;ome ca&s;es where the Co&s;tivene&s;s produced by Opium in the Small-pox has, as I have &s;een, been of advantage. But the better, more &s;afe, and now more common practice is, to obviate the Co&s;tivene&s;s by emollient cly&s;ters during the whole &s;uppuratory &s;tate, and in this way is &s;uppuration promoted by the u&s;e of Opium, and all bad effects avoided in this di&s;ea&s;e. Some are &s;o fond, on the other hand, of Opium in the Small-pox, that they give it in the purely inflammatory &s;tate, in the eruptive Fever; but I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> always found it hurtful here, and, in general, I think it ought never to be given before the fifth or &s;ixth evening after the attack. As to the &s;econdary Fever of the Small-pox, it is often inflammatory, and we want to obtain a diarrhoea in it, &s;o that here the u&s;e of Opium is very ab&s;urd. Even where there were the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ymptoms of determination to the brain and delirium, or what he improperly calls <HI>Phrenitis,</HI> Sydenham gave do&s;es of
<PB N="337" REF="014000_0343_0F928AC6F3DDA238">
Opium till he overcame that &s;ymptom. There are other analogous ca&s;es, where the &s;ymptoms, which are apt to alarm from the u&s;e of Opium, are only to be taken off by a larger exhibition of it. We now come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To the u&s;e of Opium in pains ari&s;ing from Spa&s;ms. The&s;e are mo&s;t effectually in all ca&s;es cured by Opium. At all times there have been di&s;putes about the virtues of extraordinary medi|cines. While Hecquet, at Paris, carries the u&s;e of Opium to an extravagant length; on the other hand, the Stahlians will not admit it at all; &s;aying it operates merely as a palliative, without removing the cau&s;e. Mo&s;t manife&s;tly here it has a different effect, not only removing the &s;en&s;e of pain, but al&s;o its cau&s;e. Spa&s;ms only &s;ub&s;i&s;t in con&s;equence of an unequal di&s;tribution of the ner|vous power, and therefore are to be cured from Stimulants, or Sedatives exhibited. Of what u&s;e Opium is in curing Spa&s;ms, appears from its being the only &s;ucce&s;sful remedy in tho&s;e violent &s;pa&s;modic affections, the <HI>Tetanos</HI> and <HI>Opi&s;thotonos,</HI> which occur in the warmer climates, as you can &s;ee from the accounts of Cham|bers and Hillary. I therefore take it to be a rule, that in all &s;pa&s;modic affections, and in all pains produced by them, which are not attended with an inflammatory effect, Opium is not only in|nocent, but nece&s;&s;ary, both as a Sedative and Simulant. We &s;hall here proceed a little in detail. There is no part &s;o liable to &s;pa&s;|modic affections as the alimentary canal, where Opium will not only be u&s;eful, as acting on the &s;y&s;tem in general, but as here being applied to the morbid part, and therefore is Opium &s;o efficacious in all ca&s;es of Cholics. Spa&s;ms in the alimentary canal may ari&s;e from a great variety of cau&s;es, which &s;ometimes point out a different method of exhibition; though none of them ex|clude the u&s;e of our medicine entirely. To be a little more par|ticular. Spa&s;ms of the inte&s;tines are &s;ometimes of the hy&s;teric kind, &s;ometimes of the hypochondriac, and frequently pa&s;s for one or other of the&s;e, when they are properly arthritic. In other ca&s;es they are connected with the haemorrhoidal flux, either attend|ing

In the whole of the&s;e, except the la&s;t, the cure is generally &s;ounded on Opium. In the different &s;pecies of Cholic, varieties ari&s;e, which give &s;omewhat different indications, and point out the joining of other &s;ub&s;tances with the Opium; for in &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is an ab&s;olute cure, in others only a palliative. In all the ca&s;es mentioned Opium is u&s;eful, and may be an entire cure, except where Co&s;tivene&s;s is to be overcome, acrid matter or hardened faeces to be evacuated. But this exception is by no means &s;o &s;trong as has been imagined, and even where acrid matter and hardened faeces are to be &s;ubdued, Opium may be employed. Thus in Diarrhoeas and Choleras, where the evacuation of the acrid matter is very proper, we mu&s;t not proceed too long with this evacuation, but generally, in &s;uch ca&s;es where they are violent, mu&s;t quiet the &s;pa&s;ms for &s;ome

time, and defer the evacuation. The ca&s;e is much &s;tronger in har|dened faeces. Opium certainly produces a &s;low action of the peri|&s;taltic motion, and co&s;tivene&s;s; but this co&s;tivene&s;s in the Ileus, <HI>e. g.</HI> and <HI>Colica Pictonum,</HI> depends upon &s;pa&s;ms, without allaying of which the faeces cannot be expelled, and, in effect, we &s;ee pur|gatives often do no good without Opium. Nay, there are many in&s;tances, and I my&s;elf have &s;een of them, where Opium has procured an evacuation without the purgatives. But the Opium and the purgative may be given at the &s;ame time, and experience proves, that though it does check the operation of the purgative, it does more than compen&s;ate for that, by taking off the &s;pa&s;ms. Now I &s;ee that practitioners are agreed, that in the Ileus and Dry Belly|ach, we ought not to wait till the evacuation is procured, but &s;hould give the Opium at fir&s;t, and the purgatives directly afterwards, or very often <HI>&s;imul et &s;emel.</HI> Nothing has mi&s;led us more, than &s;up|po&s;ing the Ileus always attended with inflammation. If, indeed, we can &s;ee undoubted &s;igns of it, the hard frequent pul&s;e, fixed pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we &s;hould &s;top the exhibition of the Opium. But even with the&s;e we are often deceived, and the &s;udden operation in &s;uch ca&s;es, and cure produced by the Opium, have evinced, that no In|flammation took place. Often in the Ileus, and <HI>intus</HI> &s;u&s;ception ari&s;es from Spa&s;ms, and inflammation is only in con&s;equence of that. If you look into writers, as De Haen and Hillary, you will find the u&s;e of Opiates well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the <HI>Colica Pictonum.</HI> I cannot en|ter into a detail upon this head, but this general rule may &s;uffice, that except in &s;o far as inflammation may check its u&s;e altogether, or in &s;o far as hardened faeces require its exhibition to be deferred, or to be joined with purgatives, there is no ca&s;e in which the Opium is not of &s;ervice. We &s;hall here, however, mention particularly the &s;pa&s;modic pains of the &s;tomach, di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the inte&s;tines, and often ari&s;ing from acidity, arthritic, hy&s;teric, and hypochondriac affections. Opium certainly may be employed in the&s;e, as well as the other ca&s;es, but in the three la&s;t, as the Diathe&s;is &s;till remains in the &s;y&s;tem, as Opium is apt to induce a habit, as the fit is often apt to &s;ecur, as Opium, by weakening the &s;tomach, tends to make
<PB N="340" REF="014000_0346_0F928ACB571CA040">
that recurrence more frequent, it is very doubtful whether, in all ca&s;es, &s;uch &s;pa&s;modic affections of the &s;tomach &s;hould be checked by this remedy. It would be much better, except where the ut|mo&s;t violence of pain forces the u&s;e of Opium, to u&s;e riding on hor&s;e|back. If Opiates are nece&s;&s;ary, they &s;hould be mixed with An|ti&s;pa&s;modics, or the &s;timulant Aromatics formerly mentioned, though even with the&s;e there is the &s;ame danger of habit and weak|ening as with the Opium. Here many would proceed by Evacuants, as the fit often ari&s;es from crudities, and it is on this footing that vomiting has been pre&s;cribed. But there is the &s;ame objection to Emetics as to Opium, that they do not take off the cau&s;e; and be&s;ides I have &s;een the tone of the &s;tomach entirely de&s;troyed by their u&s;e. Upon the whole, then, in cardialgic pains, there is no one remedy to be depended upon, or always to be continued, but &s;ometimes we mu&s;t u&s;e Evacuants, &s;ometimes warm Aromatics and Anti&s;pa&s;modics, and in more violent ca&s;es Opiates.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now &s;ay &s;omewhat of Spa&s;ms in the other abdominal vi&s;cera. 1. As to Spa&s;ms in the <HI>Uterus;</HI> the&s;e may be of three kinds, 1. at the men&s;trual period; for be&s;ide tho&s;e mentioned to occur in the alimentary canal at that time, they al&s;o take place in the Uterus; 2. more manife&s;tly they occur at the flow of the <HI>Lochiae,</HI> in what we call grinding pains; 3. there are ca&s;es where &s;pa&s;modic pains of the Uterus accompany child-birth. In all the&s;e Opium is the only effectual remedy. We have already mentioned, under Sedatives in general, that in tho&s;e pains which precede or accompany the men&s;trual flux, Opium not only takes off the&s;e pains, but, &s;o far from checking the &s;alutary excretion, pro|motes the free flow. In the grinding pains Opium is al&s;o an effectual cure, except where, from any hurt given in delivery, a pain from inflammatory di&s;ten&s;ion is produced, and then we mu&s;t u&s;e it with greater caution. With regard to the pains which accompany birth it&s;elf, the&s;e are often of the &s;pa&s;modic kind, and commonly called fal&s;e pains. It is now an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, that Opium takes off the&s;e, without hindering the &s;alutary to en&s;ue, and therefore in all
<PB N="341" REF="014000_0347_0F928ACB8B938FE0">
Spa&s;ms of the Uterus, is Opium u&s;eful, except where they are ac|companied with inflammation. I forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t to mention, in talking of the grinding pains, that by long continuance they are apt to induce an inflammatory diathe&s;is, and in &s;uch &s;tate of them, Opium mu&s;t be exhibited with very great caution. 2. As to the u&s;e of Opium in Spa&s;ms of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, the kidneys, ureters, and bladder; pains ari&s;ing from affections of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages are commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from &s;tones &s;ticking in the <HI>tubuli urini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eri,</HI> ure|ters, or neck of the bladder, and con&s;equently from inflammatory di&s;ten&s;ion; but often al&s;o they proceed from Spa&s;ms, and there is no other method of accounting for the great pain produced by &s;mall &s;tones in the ureters, &s;uch &s;tones as would ea&s;ily pa&s;s through them, but from their irritation producing a Spa&s;m which hinders their pa&s;&s;age; and hence we mu&s;t account for the effect Opium is found to have in expeding the evacuation of &s;and and gravel in nephritic ca&s;es. But con&s;tantly here we mu&s;t have in our eye this exception, that whenever the pul&s;e is hard, whenever the per&s;on is young and plethoric, we mu&s;t u&s;e bleeding to take off the inflammation, and fomentations to the part. With re&s;pect to &s;mall &s;tones at the head of the urethra, we have already &s;poken under Sedatives in general. 3. As to icteric Spa&s;ms from &s;tones in the <HI>Ductus choledochus,</HI> I think we frequently &s;ee ca&s;es where the Spa&s;ms in this duct are the cau&s;e of ob&s;truction and regurgitation of the bile. The only per|fect cure, in &s;uch ca&s;es, is, from the &s;tones cau&s;ing the Spa&s;m being dropt out into the inte&s;tines. Probably here, as in the ca&s;e of the ureter, the pa&s;&s;age is more &s;low from the &s;pa&s;modic affections of the duct, and therefore, in the&s;e icteric pains, Opium may be of &s;er|vice, by obviating the irritation, dulling the &s;en&s;e of the duct, and allowing its dilatation.</P>
<P>We next come to talk of the u&s;e of Opium in &s;pa&s;modic affec|tions of the thorax. Perhaps there may be &s;ome variety in the&s;e. The heart it&s;elf is &s;ubject to Spa&s;m, at lea&s;t to palpitation and &s;pa&s;|modico-convul&s;ive motions, but the&s;e are not to be cured by opiates. The Lungs are, of the thoracic vi&s;cera, mo&s;t frequently &s;ubject to
<PB N="342" REF="014000_0348_0F928ACC2C1F8070">
Spa&s;ms, but the&s;e are often without pain, and perhaps I &s;hould have made a head of &s;pa&s;modic affections without pain; but as they are &s;o few, I &s;hall comprehend them under this head. Opium, as increa&s;ing the action of the heart, and accelerating the circulation through the lungs, mu&s;t make the breathing more difficult, and more frequent, and therefore the practice with it in a&s;thmatic ca&s;es, had been &s;uppo&s;ed very nice. I think this may be in &s;uch ca&s;es a general rule, that in all ca&s;es of pure Spa&s;m, Opium is u&s;eful; in all ca&s;es of infarction hurtful. The &s;pa&s;modic periodic A&s;thma is often of a mixed kind, attended with infarction, and terminating by expectoration; &s;o that here the Opium would &s;eem to do more harm, by hindering the excretion, than good, by relieving the Spa&s;m. For the method of proceeding here, I would refer you to Sir John Floyer. He, in &s;uch ca&s;es, emptied the guts by a gly&s;ter, and the &s;tomach by a puke, and then exhibited the Opium. I have fol|lowed the &s;ame practice with &s;ucce&s;s, and have &s;ound, that though the Opium did, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, hinder the expectoration, yet that after the Spa&s;m was taken off by it, the expectoration became more free. Next, as to the u&s;e of Opium in &s;pa&s;modic pains of the head. Head-ach is a very frequent ailment, ari&s;ing from a very great va|riety of cau&s;es, producing, as I have now found, after endeavour|ing to di&s;tingui&s;h Head-achs from their cau&s;es, feelings exactly of the &s;ame kind. Of the&s;e Head-achs, &s;everal are not of a &s;pa&s;modic nature, in which the Opium is hurtful, as tho&s;e proceeding from in|flammatory pains, and, what is more frequent, from rheumatic af|fections. There is a third kind, the apoplectic, by which I mean a certain &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, where the blood is apt to be collected in great quantity in the veins of the head, and proves the cau&s;e of Vertigo, Lethargy, and other &s;oporo&s;e affections, where the Opium is al&s;o hurtful. In the pure &s;pa&s;modic Head-achs, which we di&s;cern by their happening in per&s;ons &s;ubject to other Spa&s;ms, by their tran&s;ient continuance, and the remedies u&s;ed, Opium is u&s;eful. The&s;e may be con&s;idered as of two kinds; idiopathic, where the di&s;ea&s;e is in the head it&s;elf; &s;ympathetic, where it proceeds from connection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with other parts, particularly the &s;tomach. In the idio|pathic
<PB N="343" REF="014000_0349_0F928ACCE96630B8">
&s;pa&s;modic Head-ach, where we can di&s;cover it, Opium is u&s;eful. In the &s;ympathic, although Emetics there be indicated, yet Opium is al&s;o u&s;eful. It is doubted whether the <HI>Clavis hy&s;tericus</HI> be idiopathic or &s;ympathic. Certain I am of having often &s;een it affecting the head, where no other &s;pa&s;modic affection was pre&s;ent in the &s;y&s;tem, or occurred for a long time afterwards. As purely &s;pa&s;|modic, this affection is to be cured by Opium. To this may be referred the laceration. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of tendons, producing the Locked Jaw, which is now found to be mo&s;t effectually relieved by Opium. This, perhaps, may rather belong to the head of Irritation, or to Spa&s;ms in the extremities. As to the &s;pa&s;ms in the extremities, the Opi&s;thotonos, in which we have already mentioned the good effects of Opium, and referred you to Authors, comprehends them all.</P>
<P N="3">3 We come to the u&s;e of Opium in pains ari&s;ing from <HI>Irritation.</HI> The&s;e are of various kinds, not ea&s;ily to be enumerated. The mo&s;t remarkable are tho&s;e which attend Cancers and other Ulcers: In all of the&s;e Opium is a &s;afe palliative. Tho&s;e, who are prejudiced again&s;t Opium, condemn it as only a palliative, and often bringing back the pain which it palliated with exacerbation; but this is by no means &s;o often the ca&s;e as has been imagined. Thus, for in&s;tance, if an acrid matter be lodged in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> if we can check its effects and take off the &s;pa&s;ms, in con&s;equence of the powers of dige&s;tion, and the afflux of the animal fluids, the acri|mony may be corrected, in &s;ome ca&s;es even evacuated, and &s;o the Opium prove more than a palliative. Dr. Young imagines it a hurtful palliative, but even his own facts being given, his rea&s;oning upon them is not good. But the facts he alledges do not agree with my experience, and I have often &s;een the pain ca&s;ed without any bad con&s;equences. The virtues of the narcotic Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ta leads us to &s;uppo&s;e Opium may at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be a &s;afe palliative; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t I think more may be added; for I find that Opium will even mend the di|ge&s;tion in Cancers. In other ulcers, attended with pain, Opium al&s;o may be exhibited with good effect. The&s;e are perhaps the only Irritations we can here &s;peak of. In pains ari&s;ing from fractures,
<PB N="344" REF="014000_0350_0F928ACDA7486968">
wounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the temporary relief given by Opiates, as the&s;e are of inflammatory nature, will be hurtful. I think it even dangerous, as Young advi&s;es, to exhibit them before operations. But in the ca&s;e of wounds, whether given by art, or de&s;ign, or got by accident, if tending to &s;uppuration, and accompanied with pain, I think I have not only &s;een the good effect of Opium in relieving that, but al&s;o in promoting the &s;uppuration it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The other general head, to which may be referred the ca&s;es in which Opium is employed, is in <HI>praeternaturally encrea&s;ed Evacu|ation.</HI> But before we enter upon that, we &s;hall &s;peak of the u&s;e of Opium in <HI>Fever.</HI> In Intermittent Fevers the u&s;e of Opium was common and con&s;tant among the ancients, and we have in this en|deavoured to imitate them in modern times. A celebrated writer, in the French Memoirs, has given us an account of his practice with Opium in Intermittents. He was led accidentally to u&s;e them from the occurrence of an uncommon degree of &s;pa&s;m; and laying down as a rule, I imagine very properly, that the acce&s;&s;ion was owing to &s;pa&s;m, he ventured to try the effects of Opium again&s;t it. He gave it about an hour before the acce&s;&s;ion, which it commonly prevented, and procured a mild &s;weat. If given in the time of the acce&s;&s;ion, he found it was employed with danger, if long before it, that its effects were lo&s;t: H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, that one hour before was what an&s;wered be&s;t, and allows only a deviation of a quarter more or le&s;s. He thinks Intermittents may be di&s;tingui&s;hed according to their degree of acce&s;&s;ion; in &s;ome very &s;trong &s;pa&s;modic motions, rigor, tremor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> en&s;uing, in others, the&s;e being in a much milder de|gree. It was in the former ca&s;e he found Opium chiefly of &s;ervice. It has been a frequent practice to exhibit Opium in different ca&s;es. Boerhaave's <HI>Antipyreticum raro fallens</HI> contains two grains of Opium; and, indeed, I imagine it is only from our extraordinary attention to the Bark, that we do not perceive the effects of Opium. We chiefly join it with the Bark to prevent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ging, but I think it has al&s;o a con&s;iderable effect as anti&s;pa&s;modic. In continued Fevers Opium has been more frequently employed. Tralles has
<PB N="345" REF="014000_0351_0F928ACE67B97EA0">
be&s;towed much pains on this part of his &s;ubject; but he appears to me to argue like a man who had already &s;ettled his point, and to have been prejudiced again&s;t it; nay, indeed, to overlook, or rather to be totally ignorant of the con&s;iderations which &s;hould deter|mine the que&s;tion. In inflammatory Fevers Opium is certainly hurtful, but all Fevers are not of this kind, either in their begin|ning or continuance; and every body allows now the Nervous Fever, or that wherein the <HI>vis vitae</HI> is apt to &s;ink; and al&s;o that every continued Fever con&s;i&s;ts of repeated paroxy&s;ins. In the ca&s;e of the Nervous Fever Opium may be u&s;ed as a Stimulant, and where the remi&s;&s;ions are di&s;tinct, and the acce&s;&s;ions in con&s;equence, as a Sedative. In the la&s;t ca&s;e it may be u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as the Bark, and whenever a di&s;tinct acce&s;&s;ion comes on, and it is u&s;eful to throw in the Bark, Opium may be al&s;o employed. Of the&s;e things Tralles takes no notice. Wine, I think, is an analogous remedy to Opium, being both &s;edative and &s;timulant. In the la&s;t intention it is preferable to Opium, as it can be given in a &s;maller do&s;e, and al&s;o from the acid which accompanies it, is le&s;s inflammatory, and there|fore, on this account, in doubtful ca&s;es may be more effectually u&s;ed, as well as from the &s;ubdivided and gradual manner in which we can exhibit it. But I have &s;een Fevers attended with very &s;trong &s;pa&s;mo|dic affections, where Camphire, Mu&s;k, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were u&s;ed, where the Opium was of much more con&s;equence, and even, as I have &s;een, it removed delirium it&s;elf; and indeed I believe it may be &s;aid univer|&s;ally, there is no ca&s;e in which we u&s;e Wine, where we may not al&s;o employ Opium.</P>
<P>We now go on to con&s;ider the u&s;e of Opium in <HI>encrea&s;ed evacu|ations.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e which I &s;hall mention is the Catarrh, an affec|tion in common to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> head and brea&s;t. In general this di&s;ea&s;e may be con&s;idered as an encrea&s;ed evacuation of mucus, more commonly in the thin acrid &s;tate in which it is then immediately &s;ecreted. More commonly, however, as we have con&s;idered Catar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h as a di&s;ea&s;e
<PB N="346" REF="014000_0352_0F928AD0A59D70B8">
in the membrane of the bronchiae, and as accompanied with in|farction, Opium has been thought of di&s;advantage. I think the matter may be compromi&s;ed by the&s;e general rules; 1&s;t, Catarrh may be a recent affection from Cold, and then is more or le&s;s of an inflammatory and feveri&s;h nature, and con&s;equently here Opium may be hurtful and dangerous. But there are many ca&s;es of recent Cold, attended with Cough and Catarrh, where I have &s;een Opium employed with &s;afety, very often operating by diaphore&s;is or &s;weat, which obviated its bad effects. A di&s;pute has ari&s;en, whether we &s;hould attempt to cure a recent cold by &s;weating. I have &s;een &s;uch a practice encrea&s;e it. In general, if there is any degree of Fever, it is not advi&s;eable to attempt the cure by opiates. 2dly, Where the Catarrh is of long &s;tanding, is habitual, not inflammatory, where the &s;tillicidium is thin and acrid, Opium is the only effectual remedy, as taking off the &s;en&s;ibility of the part, &s;topping the evacuation, and allowing the matter to remain in the follicles till it has obtained its proper con&s;i&s;tence and blandne&s;s. This I con&s;ider as an encrea&s;ed <HI>excretion.</HI> 3dly, In Catarrhs where there is an increa&s;ed <HI>&s;ecretion,</HI> and a great deal of gro&s;s mucus, &s;eemingly ari&s;ing from a greater quantity of the fluids, which furni&s;h this mucous matter, being car|ried to the lungs, I con&s;ider the di&s;ea&s;e as an infarction.</P>
<P>Next the encrea&s;ed Evacuation, in which we &s;hall con&s;ider the effects of Opium, is Vomiting. This might have been referred to the head of Spa&s;m, but as there is an appearance of Evacuation, it is indifferent whether we con&s;ider it here or there. With regard to the u&s;e of Opium in Vomitings, the practice is difficult, as they may ari&s;e from &s;uch a prodigious variety of cau&s;es. When Vomitings ari&s;e from acrid matters taken into the &s;tomach, they mu&s;t be cured by their expul&s;ion. Thus it would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">very ab&s;urd to check the effects of poi&s;ons &s;wallowed by the exhibition of Opium: But when the Vomiting proceeds from acrid matter generated in the &s;tomach it&s;elf, acting as a leaven, and changing into its nature the other juices poured into that organ; when the Vomiting has been drawn out to a great length and proceeds to debilitating, it may be quieted by
<PB N="347" REF="014000_0353_0F928AD314CAEFE0">
Opium. Nay, perhaps by this means the matter may be thrown into the inte&s;tines, there corrected by a greater afflux of fluids, and by means of a gly&s;ter evacuated. Thus in Cholera, where the &s;tomach has been cleared, and the vomiting proceeds from a greater flow of bile cau&s;ed by an inverted motion of the guts, Opium may be u&s;eful, by taking off the inverted motion. Where the vomiting proceeds from inflammation or &s;cirrho&s;ity, Opium is u&s;ele&s;s, in many &s;uch ca&s;es hurtful. Where vomiting is a &s;ympathetic affection, from &s;pa&s;ms of the alimentary canal communicated to the &s;tomach, Opium is univer&s;ally u&s;eful. There is one ca&s;e in which it is very doubtful, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in that Vomiting which occurs in the cold fit of In|termittent Fevers. Some check this by Opium, and &s;ome mix it with their &s;aline draughts. If the &s;aline draught could be retained in the &s;tomach, then perhaps Opium might be u&s;eful in de|termining to the &s;urface. But in mo&s;t ca&s;es this Vomiting is a &s;a|lutary effort of Nature to throw off the offending cau&s;e, and to de|termine to the &s;urface, and therefore ought not to be checked by Opium.</P>
<P>We are now to talk of encrea&s;ed Evacuations in the lower belly. In Diarrhoea and Dy&s;entery the u&s;e of Opium is very common, but the particular circum&s;tances in which it ought to be exhibited are not &s;o well a&s;certained. Where Dy&s;entery is recent, accompanied with Fever, and perhaps inflammatory dia|the&s;is, and, in &s;hort, wherever one would think of bleeding in this di&s;ea&s;e, Opium &s;hould not be employed. Some are for con&s;idering Dy&s;entery always as an inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e; but I imagine this is but &s;eldom the ca&s;e, and where it is not, Opium may be em|ployed. Di&s;putes have ari&s;en on this &s;ubject, and it has been &s;aid, as giving occa&s;ion to the retention of the acrid matter, and hardened faeces, Opium &s;hould not be u&s;ed. To be &s;ure the whole of the cure mu&s;t not be tru&s;ted to it. Dr. Young's arguments, who thinks he has treated this part of his &s;ubject very fully, amounts to no more than what we have &s;aid of the retention of the acrid matter. But Opium may certainly be compatible with the Eva|cuation
<PB N="348" REF="014000_0354_0F928AD444E91C50">
of the&s;e hardened faeces, and acrid matter. Often, as in the <HI>Ileus</HI> and <HI>Colica Pictonum,</HI> they owe their ri&s;e to &s;pa&s;ms, and can only be removed by Opiates. As the giving Opium with pur|gatives has been allowed by Dr. Young him&s;elf, I think the whole of the di&s;pute ought to have been &s;uper&s;eded, and a general rule been e&s;tabli&s;hed, that Opium univer&s;ally may be u&s;ed, where it does not interfere with the Evacuation. Opium is not to be con&s;idered as a&s;tringent; it only dimini&s;hes the moving powers in the ve&s;&s;els for a time, leaving the &s;y&s;tem as lax as before.</P>
<P>We &s;hall next con&s;ider the effects of Opium in Evacuations of Blood, natural or morbid. The only natural Evacuation of Blood is the men&s;trual. The encrea&s;e of this may be con&s;idered as of three different kinds. The fir&s;t, which rarely happens, is attended with an inflammatory diathe&s;is; the &s;econd depending upon Spa&s;ms; the third on debility, which is &s;eldom free from the &s;e|cond. In the two la&s;t, Opium is a &s;afe and u&s;eful remedy, but not to be depended upon for a cure; for the a&s;tringency of Opium is only temporary, and it is given only as a Palliative, till other A&s;tringents can be u&s;ed, to give tone to the parts. Nay, I would advi&s;e again&s;t the too frequent u&s;e of it, as it is apt to bring on an inflammatory diathe&s;is. In too great flow of the <HI>Lochiae</HI> Opium is very proper, for this encrea&s;ing flux is often attended with &s;pa&s;modic affections, and debility; but here we mu&s;t con&s;tantly have in our view the inflammatory diathe&s;is, apt to be induced in child-birth. There is a third-ca&s;e analogous to the&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> where pregnant women are threatened with abortion, and already a flow of blood has taken place. There is no ca&s;e in which the u&s;e of Opium is more difficult than this. I have &s;een it frequently pre|vented, frequently brought on by bleeding. I dare not confine the bleeding to the plethoric, for even in the&s;e has it produced abortion, and therefore I am not ready to mark out the ca&s;es where one or the other is proper. Where the di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;es from any cau&s;e of inflammatory nature, I would admit that Bleeding is the remedy, and Opium is hurtful. Again, where the flux depends
<PB N="349" REF="014000_0355_0F928AD689F25748">
on hy&s;teric affections, and there is no inflammation, Bleeding is hurtful, and Opium is the cure. Where the abortion is owing to habit, as every body knows it may, Opium is always u&s;eful, and I have &s;een in&s;tances, where by the u&s;e of it women retained children, of which they would otherwi&s;e have mi&s;carried. The u&s;e of Opium in pregnant women is doubtful. Where pregnancy is attended with &s;pa&s;modic affections of the &s;tomach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Opium would be a palliative, but &s;till it is doubtful if it ought to be u&s;ed. In every pregnant woman, there is an inflammatory diathe&s;is, and the blood covered with a cru&s;t. Though on other occa&s;ions, I have u&s;ed this as an argument again&s;t that cru&s;t being always a morbid appearance, as in the mo&s;t healthy women it occurred, yet here I mu&s;t own, that it gives a &s;u&s;picion of the inflammatory &s;tate, and therefore &s;hould make us cautious in the u&s;e of Opium. The&s;e are the natural evacuations of Blood. What comes neare&s;t to a natural evacuation is the haemorrhoidal. I would not allow, with the Stahlians, that the haemorrhoidal flux is always a natural evacuation, but frequently, from various accidents, it becomes a habit, and a law to the &s;y&s;tem, and nece&s;&s;ary for health. From the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, being a di&s;ten&s;ion and collection of blood in the cellular membrane of the <HI>rectum,</HI> often depending on a laxity of the ve&s;&s;els, Opium may be u&s;eful; but as co&s;tivene&s;s is commonly the cau&s;e, which Opium would encrea&s;e, it will as frequently be hurtful in this di&s;ea&s;e. It is only in great urgency, and when the di&s;ea&s;e is attended with Spa&s;ms in the alimentary canal, that the exhibition of Opium &s;hould be attempted. In morbid haemorrhages, there is no doubt but that the &s;edative power of Opium will relieve their exce&s;s; but the haemorrhagic diathe&s;is is very near a-kin to the inflammatory, and whatever accumulates the fluids in the larger ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t be hurtful in haemorrhages, and accordingly we &s;ee that when they are repre&s;&s;ed by Opium, it is not uncommon to &s;ee them return with greater violence. The ancients employed Opium and Hyo&s;cyamus in &s;pitting of blood, and &s;ome lately have renewed the practice, though &s;eemingly with a good, yet, in my opinion, always with a doubtful effect. Mo&s;t
<PB N="350" REF="014000_0356_0F928AD6C1CCC8F0">
of the &s;pittings of blood are attended or followed with an inflam|matory diathe&s;is, and end in <HI>phthi&s;is pulmonalis,</HI> which is likewi&s;e of the &s;ame nature, and there the Opium is hurtful. But there are ca&s;es of &s;pitting of blood, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting for forty years, where there is no tendency to phthi&s;is, or tubercles, and where the di&s;ea&s;e has ari&s;en merely from an accidental rupture of the ve&s;&s;el, and after|wards kept up by laxity and habit. It is in &s;uch ca&s;es only in which Opium can be exhibited with any &s;afety.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the ca&s;es in which Opium is hurtful, or of advan|tage. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;everal may be omitted. At pre&s;ent I recollect one, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the u&s;e of Opium in the Mea&s;les. The Mea&s;les, from being an eruptory di&s;ea&s;e, and being frequently joined with the Small Pox in Treati&s;es of Phy&s;ic, has probably had the u&s;e of Opium transferred to it, from its being employed in the other. But in the Mea&s;les it ought not to be exhibited on the &s;ame footing as in the Small Pox, for the Mea&s;les is not a &s;uppuratory di&s;ea&s;e, and it was as a Suppuratory that I &s;aid Opium acted in the Small Pox. The Mea&s;les are &s;eldom dangerous in their fir&s;t attack, but after|wards are &s;o, from their inducing more or le&s;s of an inflammatory peripneumonic &s;tate, and therefore Opium mu&s;t be u&s;ed in this di&s;ea&s;e with caution. A &s;ymptom frequently indicates it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the Cough which occurs, with thin acrid di&s;tillation without much mucus, and I imagine in the beginning it may be employed, but &s;hall not determine whither it would obviate the di&s;ea&s;e in the lungs. When the eruption is over, and the peripneumonic &s;ymptoms are coming on, it is dangerous to give Opium. There is ano|ther &s;ymptom, the diarrhoea, to wit, which indicates Opium. Nothing better &s;hews the inflammatory &s;tate in the Mea&s;les than the ob&s;ervation of Sydenham, that the diarrhoea occuring here is be&s;t removed by bleeding.</P>
<P>As to the pharmaceutical treatment of Opium, little need be &s;aid about it. Its virtues may be extracted equally by every men&s;truum. All the preparations of it are only made with the

<P>Oppo&s;ite to <HI>b</HI> &s;tands the title <HI>Umbellatae.</HI> I have mentioned only two genera of the &s;ame order, the re&s;t of which may have &s;imilar virtues.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="sedative">
<HEAD>CICUTA.</HEAD>
<P>Linnaeus applies the term <HI>Cicuta</HI> to the <HI>Cicuta aquatica,</HI> calling this, of which we are &s;peaking, <HI>Conium.</HI> From what we now know of the <HI>Cicuta,</HI> I am apt to &s;u&s;pect we &s;hall find &s;ome uncommon virtues in Par&s;ley and Fennel. Fennel has, in effect, been &s;een to di&s;cu&s;s hard Tumors.</P>
<P>Of late the <HI>Cicuta</HI> is &s;o famous, that I need give no account of it, but only refer you to Stork's pamphlet. At the end he has drawn up &s;ome corollaries upon the whole of what he has &s;aid. At all times externally applied, the <HI>Cicuta</HI> has been known for re&s;olving &s;cirrhous tumors. We now learn it may be applied in|ternally for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. We imagined that medicines in|ternally given, could not reach the ve&s;&s;els of the affected parts, and I believe we were right in that &s;uppo&s;ition; for the <HI>Cicuta</HI> probably acts on the nervous power, and communicates its action to the mo&s;t di&s;tant moving fibre of the body. I leave you then to judge whether it be from encrea&s;ing the action of the ve&s;&s;els, or by di&s;&s;olving the concreted fluids, that the <HI>Cicuta'</HI>s action is exerted.</P>
<P>We cannot admit &s;ome of the corollaries at the end of Dr. Stork's pamphlet. It is a&s;&s;erted the <HI>Cicuta</HI> has no &s;en&s;ible effects. This contradicts our practic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. I have known twelve ca&s;es where vertigo was produced, one particularly where the vertigo, and &s;ome kinds of convul&s;ion was produced, and although the patient took, at length, forty grains for a do&s;e, yet did the <HI>Cicuta</HI> not cure his di&s;ea&s;e; and, what was extraordinary, even externally applied had
<PB N="352" REF="014000_0358_0F928AD82A202A18">
the &s;ame con&s;equences mentioned. Hence it cannot be &s;o &s;afe to every age and &s;ex as he mentions. Be&s;ides, as to the &s;en&s;ible eva|cuations, I my&s;elf have &s;een the <HI>Cicuta</HI> move the inte&s;tines; have good authority for its acting by urine and &s;weat, but do not indeed know if its effects were different when it had or had not (which was more commonly the ca&s;e) any &s;en&s;ible evacuation produced by it. Stork recommends the <HI>Cicuta</HI> in the Struma, which is a very vague term, and has been applied to every &s;welling of the conglo|bate glands. This does not apply to our Scrophula, which is not a topical di&s;ea&s;e, but diffu&s;ed over the whole of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, and occurring more frequently in the young than old. The fir&s;t, &s;econd, ninth, tenth, and thirteenth ca&s;es are all different from our Scrophula, except the tenth, which comes neare&s;t to it; and in the other the di&s;ea&s;e is in old per&s;ons, and much farther extended than our Scro|phula, in which we have commonly employed the <HI>Cicuta,</HI> and com|monly indeed failed, from the rea&s;ons given.</P>
<P>From having had lately recommended in Cancers a remedy which failed, I imagine we are too apt to di&s;tru&s;t the <HI>Cicuta.</HI> I have &s;een two de&s;perate ca&s;es, one of a Cancer in the lip, and another in the brea&s;t, which are nearly cured by it; and have had accounts of others from per&s;ons of verocity. For my part, I have no manner of doubt in believing in the &s;ucce&s;s of the Vienna practice. Many circum&s;tances may mi&s;lead us in judging of the virtues of the <HI>Cicuta.</HI> We may have applied it to di&s;ea&s;es to which it is not &s;uited, as in the <HI>Scrophula</HI> or Cancers, and <HI>Scirrhi,</HI> which ari&s;e from cau&s;es not to be removed by it; we may have failed from u&s;ing an improper medicine, <HI>i. e.</HI> taken at a wrong time of the year, or a wrong pre|pared extract; from u&s;ing it for too &s;hort a time, (for in many of Stork's ca&s;es a very long time was required;) from too gradual an application perhaps of the do&s;e, by which, when we have attained a large one, we lo&s;e its effects; and &s;everal other cau&s;es to which we do not attend. In many of the ca&s;es, both here and at London, the medicine has procured a good &s;uppuration, but gone no further, which I imagine to be owing to the &s;mall do&s;e having lo&s;t its effects

<HEAD>CICUTA AQUATICA.</HEAD>
<P>Since &s;uch virtues are found in the common <HI>Cicuta,</HI> we may infer the &s;ame to the <HI>Cicuta aquatica,</HI> which has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the poi&s;oning <HI>Cicuta</HI> of the ancients. Poi&s;on and medicine only differ in degree, and I imagine we are very ra&s;h in rejecting &s;ub&s;tances, from &s;u&s;picion of the danger. I had &s;et this down in order, with that of &s;everal others, to give you the hi&s;tory of it as a poi&s;on, but that I find our time obliges us to neglect. As poi&s;onous, this plant belongs to the next &s;et, which is a natural order, called by Linnaeus LURIDAE, which he imagines to be poi&s;onous, from their malignant a&s;pect; but the botanical analogy likewi&s;e takes place, for all of the &s;ame cla&s;s have the &s;ame virtues. Of the &s;ix mentioned, the virtues are much the &s;ame. Po&s;&s;ibly there may be &s;ome variety, and indeed experiments &s;eem to &s;how it. We &s;hall only remark upon three of them.</P>

<HEAD>BELLADONNA, or SOLANUM LETHALE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>This is marked out as a poi&s;on, which does not exclude it as a medicine. Ge&s;ner tells us, that the expre&s;&s;ed juice of the berries, made into a &s;yrup, is a &s;afe and u&s;eful anodyne; and by a pea&s;ant in Utland, infu&s;ed in wine, it was found to be employed as a cure for the Dy&s;entery. Another author, tells us of its &s;ucce&s;s in cancerous ca&s;es, and the&s;e are the be&s;t te&s;timonies of its virtues, which indeed, from analogy, we &s;hould readily expect. Lambergen abroad, and Gataker at home, have given us in&s;tances of its &s;ucce&s;s; and if well atte&s;ted in&s;tances are brought of its &s;ucce&s;s, although it has failed both here and at London, we may judge of it in the &s;ame manner as of the <HI>Cicuta.</HI> From my own experience I can &s;ay

&s;omewhat of it. A woman, born of a mother who died of a Cancer, and her &s;on, had, the one a Cancer in the Lip, the other on the Cheek near the angle of the eye. The &s;on, who had the Cancer in the Lip, got the <HI>Belladonna,</HI> began with half a grain, and by degrees had the do&s;e encrea&s;ed to twelve grains of the dry herb, which produced a good pus in the wound, prevented its &s;preading, and healed it up, all to a &s;mall &s;peck covered with a &s;cab. The medicine had produced a heat, and afterwards a con&s;triction of the fauces, from which it was given up, but the Cancer afterwards breaking out, recour&s;e was again had to the <HI>Belladonna,</HI> and with the &s;ame good effect as before, but with the &s;ame con&s;triction of the fauces. After this the lad was &s;eized with a vomiting of blood and died. This vomiting of blood I impute to the <HI>Belladonna.</HI> In the mother the Cancer was of fifteen years &s;tanding, and began a &s;mall ero&s;ion, which gradually extended to her eye: She u&s;ed the <HI>Belladonna</HI> very cautiou&s;ly, and &s;oon found relief from the pain, found the farther extent of the &s;ore prevented, good pus formed, and at la&s;t a contraction of the &s;ore. In this &s;tate has &s;he continued for the&s;e four years. Whenever the &s;ore again renews, &s;he has re|cour&s;e again to the medicine, which effectually prevents its extend|ing; nay, &s;ometimes &s;he goes &s;o far as to make it contract a little, but never &s;o much as to heal it up entirely.</P>
<P>There is a ca&s;e mentioned in Juncker's <HI>Con&s;pectus Therapeiae,</HI> of what he calls the wonderful effects of the <HI>Belladonna</HI> in curing Can|cers, but he al&s;o gives us another in&s;tance in which it failed. The&s;e, and the ca&s;es I have mentioned, only &s;hew that the <HI>Belladonna</HI> is not fit for all ca&s;es of Scirrhus and Cancers, which is al&s;o true of the <HI>Cicuta;</HI> but this does not hinder either the one or the other from being a valuable remedy.</P>

<P>The anodyne and narcotic virtues are here joined with a large proportion of the Stimulant. Every body knows its errhine power, its power of &s;timulating the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, and internal parts of the &s;y&s;tem. Its errhine and &s;alivatory powers are too fre|quently employed. I take the u&s;e of it to be very uncertain. As errhine, its effects are lo&s;t by habit, though it is &s;uppo&s;ed to continue to produce the excretion of mucus, which, as it is an excrement, is not of much harm. As &s;alivatory, it does not encrea&s;e the &s;ecre|tion, and takes off and expends a fluid nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;y&s;tem, palls the appetite, hurts dige&s;tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;ame is to be &s;aid of the u&s;e of it in fumes. Its quality as emetic is valued by &s;ome, but I know no advantage it has above other acrids. In the Dy&s;entery, Opium is conjoined with purgatives. The <HI>Nicotiana</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in it|&s;elf both the &s;timulant and &s;edative qualities, and by Diemerbrock has been employed, with advantage, in the di&s;ea&s;e of which we are &s;peaking. Given by the mouth, it is &s;o liable to prove emetic, that it is very inconveniently employed as a purgative. Given in a gly&s;ter it an&s;wers much better. Its do&s;e may be from half a drachm to one drachm in infu&s;ion. It is as certain a remedy in all ca&s;es where gly&s;ters are wanted, as any I know, only if the do&s;e be large, it is apt to produce weakne&s;s at &s;tomach, vomiting, and tremors and &s;pa&s;ms over the whole body; however, properly exhibited, it is of advantage in many ca&s;es. Du Haen has found the fumes of it very

<P>From the effect of the fumes, we &s;ee the active parts may, in great mea&s;ure, be volatilized. Hence we can obtain a milder pre|paration by boiling. It has been long u&s;ed in &s;yrup. When the acrimony is taken off by boiling, it may be exhibited with more confidence internally, though its purgative effects are, by this means, taken off; but here it may be introduced into the &s;y&s;tem, and prove diuretic and pectoral. If in this &s;tate it retain its nar|cotic and &s;timulant effects, it may an&s;wer better than Opium, or &s;imple Stimulants. Externally, like the <HI>Cicuta,</HI> it has been employ|ed for re&s;olving Scirrhu&s;&s;es; and, made into ointment, has been em|ployed as a detergent, and dige&s;tive in Ulcers.

nay, we are apt not only to deceive others, but our&s;elves, and to fancy tho&s;e qualities we wi&s;h to exi&s;t. All the&s;e circum&s;tances take place with regard to Coffee and Tea. Their effects are, in my opi|nion, very much mixed, depending on the warm water. All this has &s;o much weight with me, that I cannot &s;peak po&s;itively on this head. The a&s;&s;i&s;ting dige&s;tion, relieving the &s;tomach from a load of aliment, from crudities, and from head-achs ari&s;ing from them, promoting the &s;ecretion of the urine, and perhaps of per&s;piration, may all fairly be attributed to the warm water. The &s;ame, al&s;o, will have the effect of keeping from &s;leep. The&s;e are the chief of the virtues a&s;cribed to Tea and Coffee. The weakening the tone of the &s;tomach by frequent u&s;e, weakening the &s;y&s;tem in con&s;e|quence, inducing tremors and &s;pa&s;modic affections, are the effects of the Tea it&s;elf, though in &s;ome mea&s;ure al&s;o of the warm water. This applies to Tea chiefly. I have a &s;tomach very &s;en&s;ible, which I have found to be hurt by Tea, which I attributed to the warm water, but having u&s;ed &s;ome indigenous plants with the &s;ame heat of water, I found no harm en&s;ue, and this I have repeated above fifty times. I continue now to u&s;e Tea, but without the &s;ame effect as before from habit, and al&s;o from my advance in life. Many others I know, who have had the &s;ame experience. The &s;ame effects are not &s;o remarkable in Coffee; but &s;till experience &s;hews them to be of the &s;ame nature. From the u&s;e of it I have always an arthritic affection of my &s;tomach but no tremor. Farther, I can &s;upport what I have &s;aid on Tea, from botanical analogy, for it belongs to an order of plants of the narcotic kind, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Coadunatae.</HI> The&s;e narcotic effects are &s;o remarkable, that the people of A&s;ia do not u&s;e it till it is a year old. As we have it, it is always of that age, and has its acrimony in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;&s;ipated; but as it has an emetic quality, it &s;hews that it is not all gone.</P>
<P>After all, I think we may conclude, that Coffee and Tea, how|ever their effects be varied by habit, or particular con&s;titutions, are here properly placed as Sedatives, as weakening the tone of the &s;y&s;tem, and dimini&s;hing the force of the nervous power.</P>

<P><HI>[We are now enabled, by the &s;ight of other manu&s;cripts, to put the whole of this paragraph in a better condition; and give it accordingly as follows:</HI></P>
<P>With regard to every affection of the nervous power, we have been much in the dark, and particularly, with regard to the nature of &s;pa&s;modic affections, and anti&s;pa&s;modic remedies. The learned Gaubius thus defines Spa&s;m: <HI>Spa&s;mus dicitur violenta, invita, inordi|nata fibrarum motricium actio.</HI> The original word in the Greek language means no more than contraction; but it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;|tingui&s;h tho&s;e contractions which are performed in health, from tho&s;e which are morbid, and it is only to the la&s;t that the term Spa&s;m is now applied. Dr. Gaubius, by the terms of his definition, in|tends
<PB N="361" REF="014000_0367_0F928AE4E85E51F0">
to expre&s;s the circum&s;tances of the morbid &s;tate. The actions of mu&s;cles are voluntary or involuntary, the fir&s;t are morbid when <HI>invitae,</HI> and both are &s;o when <HI>violentae et inordinatae.</HI> But, to render the definition &s;till clearer, the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rm <HI>inordinata</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood to comprehend a great deal with re&s;pect to both the cau&s;e and the manner of contraction: Thus, the contraction of the heart is ordina|rily excited by the influx of venous blood, and, in health, is in pro|portion to the &s;tate of that; but, if excited by other cau&s;es, it may be &s;aid to be an <HI>inordinata contractio.</HI> The term &s;eems to be more properly applied to &s;ome irregularity in the manner of contraction; and we &s;hall mention a chief in&s;tance of this kind. We think it is a law of the animal oeconomy, that the contraction of moving fibres is naturally &s;ucceeded by a relaxation of them; and, common|ly, the mu&s;cles contracted by the power of the will, or other natural cau&s;es, are ea&s;ily &s;tretched out again by their antagoni&s;ts, or other powers applied. If, therefore, it happens, that the contraction of a mu&s;cle is not &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;ucceeded by a relaxation, and does not ea&s;ily yield to antagoni&s;t or other &s;tretching powers applied, &s;uch a contraction may be &s;aid to be <HI>inordinata;</HI> and it is to this &s;tate of con&s;traction, that many of the moderns confine the term Spa&s;m, while the other &s;tates of inordinate contraction, they call Convul|&s;ions. Thus, Dr. Gaubius, <HI>'Qui &s;pa&s;mum a convul&s;ione di&s;tinguunt, illum vocant continuam, hanc alternantem, mu&s;culorum contractionem;</HI> This excellent author, however, is doubtful if &s;uch di&s;tinction is nece&s;&s;ary; <Q><HI>Perinde fuerit,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>num eodem an diver&s;is nominibus utere; uterque enim effectus ad idem genus pertinet, partes ea&s;dem occupat; &s;imile&s;que et cau&s;as et differentias agno&s;cit; quin et haud raro alius in alium tran&s;it.</HI></Q> It is certainly ju&s;t, as the learned au|thor ob&s;erves, that the&s;e affections are nearly related to each other, and truly belong to one genus; but, at the &s;ame time, they are evi|dently different &s;pecies, and may therefore properly be di&s;tingui&s;hed by different appellations. However, we mu&s;t own, that this is hardly the place for it, as we cannot &s;ay that the &s;everal medicines to be here mentioned under the title of Anti&s;pa&s;modic, are more &s;uited to
<PB N="362" REF="014000_0368_0F928AE5A7C876A8">
the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e than to the other &s;pecies of affection.

Affec|tions; and, by anti&s;pa&s;modic, we mean &s;uch medicines as are &s;uited to take off either, or both affections.</P>
<P>As to the manner of operating, it is difficult to explain. Spa&s;modic affections may depend upon an extraordinary influx of nervous power, and that, either in con&s;equence of a &s;timulus applied to the part or to the &s;en&s;orium, or in con&s;equence of an unequal di&s;tribution, de|pending upon the weakne&s;s and mobility of the nervous power. From hence it may be perceived, why &s;ometimes Sedatives and &s;ometimes Stimulants prove anti&s;pa&s;modic, and &s;ome have thought, that all anti&s;pa&s;modics are either the one or the other; but be&s;ides tho&s;e more obviou&s;ly &s;edative or &s;timulant, there &s;eem to be anti|&s;pa&s;modics di&s;tinct from both. Stimulants are very generally &s;uch to the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem, and very often &s;edatives &s;hew the &s;ame effects; but there are anti&s;pa&s;modics which do not at all. Again, there are anti&s;pa&s;modics which di&s;cover none of the narcotic quali|ties of &s;edatives; and therefore, from both con&s;iderations, we pre|&s;ume there are anti&s;pa&s;modics di&s;tinct from both the &s;timulants and &s;edatives. We &s;hall, indeed, have occa&s;ion frequently to &s;ay, that the anti&s;pa&s;modics are intimately connected with the&s;e other cla&s;&s;es, but &s;till, we do not allow this to be univer&s;al, and would rather a&s;|&s;ert, that mo&s;t of the medicines in our li&s;t of anti&s;pa&s;modics, are more &s;uch than in proportion to their &s;timulant or &s;edative pro|perties.</P>

<P>All fo&s;&s;ile oils have been reputed anti&s;pa&s;modic, but are likewi&s;e very powerful Stimulants, and by this means often unfit for u&s;e. They have been received as pectoral, and the &s;ame cautions take place with regard to them, as with regard to other acrids u&s;ed in that intention; for many chronic di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t are of in|flammatory nature. Be&s;ides their anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue, the fo&s;&s;ile oils have had a&s;cribed to them that of emmenagogue. Their u&s;e in this intention mu&s;t be where there are &s;pa&s;modic affections of the uterus; But I have often been deceived with them when the&s;e
<PB N="364" REF="014000_0370_0F928AE7513A6680">
affections were pre&s;ent. They are of &s;o much reputation with the women, that they take them unpre&s;cribed, and I have known ca&s;es where they have been given to procure abortion, but even in very large do&s;es without the effect, they only di&s;turbing the &s;y&s;tem in general. I mu&s;t here, however, take notice, that our <HI>Petroleum</HI> is commonly adulterated with two thirds of oil of turpentine, &s;o that, properly &s;peaking, the ca&s;es mentioned were only trials of the oil of turpentine. Fo&s;&s;ile oils have been &s;aid to be u&s;eful in Quartans, and, indeed, I conceive this probably to belong to every Anti|&s;pa&s;modic. Externally applied, their effects are more con&s;iderable and more ardent. Anointed on the extremities they are &s;aid to defend them from cold, and this virtue has been a&s;cribed to the Oil of Turpentine and Amber; but on trial they never could be applied without irritation, and di&s;appointing the effect. They have been recommended in oedematous &s;wellings, upon the &s;up|po&s;ition that that di&s;ea&s;e depended on a laxity of the part; but oedematous &s;wellings are often attended with an eri&s;ypelatous in|flammation and tendency to gangrene, which la&s;t I have &s;een brought on by the application of <HI>Petroleum.</HI> But here we need not be anxious about topical applications, for none of them are of any &s;er|vice except bandages in convale&s;cents, as the &s;welling commonly de|pends on a fault in the &s;y&s;tem. In paralytic ca&s;es they are more effectually employed. Here they &s;ometimes penetrate deep in the &s;y&s;tem, but I have no faith of their being capable to &s;timulate the <HI>Medulla &s;pinalis</HI> when rubbed along the &s;pine; nor have I any notion of their &s;topping Intermittents when rubbed upon the brea&s;t.

wherefore, as plants of this cla&s;s are frequent in Europe, and as the Gums of the&s;e exotics come &s;o often to us adulterated, we &s;hould carefully endeavour to find &s;omething of the &s;ame kind in our own plants. Though I have formerly pointed out the <HI>Umbelliferae</HI> as poi&s;onous, and the Gums might be &s;uppo&s;ed of the &s;ame virtues, yet as &s;uch qualities are often lo&s;t by drying, I would hence in&s;i|nuate, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t acrid juices of our own plants may prove the mo&s;t excellent medicines. Of <HI>A&s;&s;afoetida, Galbanum,</HI> and <HI>Sagapenum,</HI> the virtues &s;eem manife&s;tly lodged in an e&s;&s;ential oil, which ri&s;es either with water or &s;pirit.

Hence I would alledge, that of tho&s;e which have the greate&s;t proportion of e&s;&s;ential oil the anti&s;pa&s;modic virtues are greate&s;t, and &s;o in proportion. They all &s;timulate the &s;tomach, and in the countries where they are produced are employed to excite appetite and promote dige&s;tion. With us they are u&s;ed as &s;timulant and anti&s;pa&s;modic, proving carminative in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines&punc; and u&s;ed to take off the remarkable &s;pa&s;modic affections happening in the alimentary canal in the hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e. Like Aloes they are laxative to a certain degree, and like this, too, by frequent u&s;e, are apt to irritate the <HI>rectum,</HI> though neither in their irritant or purga|tive qualities are they &s;o powerful as Aloes. The&s;e, like the <HI>Foetidae</HI> formerly mentioned, have been u&s;ed as anthelmintic; and there are frequent in&s;tances of &s;trong odour affecting the in&s;ect tribe. <HI>A&s;&s;a Foetida</HI> has been long employed for this purpo&s;e, and lately has again been brought into practice. In the blood they are frequently diuretic, but are more remarkable &s;till for their dia|phoretic virtues.

From the&s;e qualities they may be ju&s;tly reckoned pectoral, not only promoting the &s;ecretion of mucus in the lungs, but perhaps al&s;o as carrying thither their anti&s;pa&s;modic virtues. The Ammoniac being recommended as the mo&s;t powerful pectoral, would make me doubt of this la&s;t &s;uppo&s;i|tion; but for my part, I am apt to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the preference to the <HI>A&s;&s;a foetida,</HI> which, however, is one of the warm pectorals mo&s;t fre|quently abu&s;ed.

Fevers, and where we can judge the proper time of exhibiting &s;ti|mulant Anti&s;pa&s;modics, they might be u&s;eful; but as I find their &s;timulant exceed their anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue, I employ them very little. Their emmenagogue property I con&s;ider as an effect on the whole &s;y&s;tem, and &s;hall afterwards mention it. I imagine it is not without &s;ome foundation, that they have been &s;aid to occa&s;ion a ra|refaction and turge&s;cence of the whole ma&s;s of blood. With regard to Aloes, this is in a manner proved, it not only inducing the hae|morrhoidal flux, but al&s;o promoting other haemorrhages, and po&s;|&s;ibly, by this means, the men&s;trual evacuation. In general, as an|ti&s;pa&s;modic, the more &s;ubtile the odour the better, and therefore I imagine it is not without rea&s;on, that <HI>A&s;&s;afaetida,</HI> in our pre&s;ent practice, &s;eems to have &s;upplanted the re&s;t.</P>
<P>As to all, for the purpo&s;e of medicine, they are of ea&s;y prepa|ration, and may be extracted either by water or &s;pirit, more effec|tually by the la&s;t. The do&s;e is difficult to a&s;&s;ign, not only on the account of their different effects on different per&s;ons, but al&s;o from their &s;trength varying according to the time kept. I exhibit them from five grains to one drachm. I have known two drachms of <HI>A&s;&s;afaetida</HI> taken in twenty-four hours with little effect, but this mu&s;t not be taken as a general rule, and probably depended on the impu|rity of the medicine.</P>

<P>This is a &s;ub&s;tance, which, for the good or harm it can do in medicine, de&s;erves particular attention. It is a &s;ub&s;tance of a very peculiar kind in nature, like to which we can produce nothing by art. It approaches in its nature to the e&s;&s;ential oils, is got from ve|getables by di&s;tillation with water, is of an acrid odour, and &s;oluble in Alcohol; but, like the&s;e, it does not &s;uffer a decompo&s;ition with di&s;tillation, nor &s;eparate as they do into oil, acid, and earth, but ri&s;es always in the &s;ame manner as before. It differs al&s;o in its relation to acids, uniting with them without efferve&s;cence, and &s;eparable from them by affu&s;ion of water, without any change. We may
<PB N="369" REF="014000_0375_0F928AEEA7B1AAB8">
allow, la&s;tly, its mode of concretion to be peculiar. It is alledged, indeed, that &s;omething of the &s;ame kind is to be &s;een in e&s;&s;ential oils. I have always perceived this concretion in e&s;&s;ential oils to be different, and more approaching to regular chry&s;tallization. What is to be made of the&s;e peculiarities, I cannot determine. As to its botanical analogy, it is got from a &s;pecies of the <HI>Laurus.</HI> Our common <HI>Laurus,</HI> in its &s;en&s;ible qualities, is nearly related to the <HI>Lauro-cera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">us,</HI> which I mentioned as a &s;trong Sedative; and, in|deed, all the &s;ub&s;tances which have the laurel bitter, are ju&s;tly &s;u&s;|pected of the &s;ame nature. Camphire, though more poignant, ap|pears to me to have the &s;ame ta&s;te and odour, and therefore, in the fir&s;t place, I would in&s;inuate a &s;u&s;picion of the &s;ame qualities, and con&s;equently a caution in the exhibition. Menghini, of Bologna, has been employed in making experiments with Camphire upon different animals, and has found it poi&s;onous to every one of them. Birds were killed with a few grains, and large do&s;es either drove into a rage, or de&s;troyed, quadrupeds. I have only the&s;e accounts from a Literary Journal. From it, however, it appears, that in &s;ome animals it produced &s;leep, followed by death, without any other &s;ymptom; that in other, before death, they were awakened into convul&s;ions and rage. It &s;eems, too, to act chiefly on the &s;tomach, for an entire piece &s;wallowed, produced the effects mentioned, with very little diminution of weight, as appeared from its being after|ward thrown up. I mention all this, to &s;hew the power of Cam|phire on the &s;y&s;tem, and at the &s;ame time to point out its danger.</P>
<P>The virtues of Camphire have been much di&s;puted. You will ea&s;ily &s;ee how that happens, from the different effects of different do&s;es on different con&s;titutions. Its con&s;iderable acrimony, &s;trong odour, and that of the di&s;agreeable kind, would lead us to think Camphire a &s;timulant. The&s;e &s;en&s;ible qualities have given occa|&s;ion to a di&s;pute not yet properly determined, whether this medicine be heating or cooling. In the fauces it produces heat, and in &s;ome, when taken into the &s;tomach, this is affected with an unea&s;y &s;en&s;a|tion of heat, while in others it may be taken in large do&s;es, with|out any &s;en&s;ible effect at all. Di&s;putes al&s;o have ari&s;en about the
<PB N="370" REF="014000_0376_0F928AEF6B732B40">
rea&s;on of this diver&s;ity of the effects of Camphire. Some account for it from the Camphire being taken in entire pieces, and alledge, that in our powders there are always &s;ome entire molecules, which, from their le&s;s &s;pecific gravity, are bouyed up, and &s;timulate the &s;en&s;ible upper orifice of the &s;tomach, and produce the heat mentioned. This certainly ought to give us a caution, in order to the minute divi&s;ion of Camphire, when exhibited. But to proceed with re|&s;pect to its heating and cooling effects. I think it is now pretty generally agreed, that it is rather cooling, not &s;timulating the heart and ve&s;&s;els, nor producing exacerbation or Fever. In &s;hort, the an|ti&s;pa&s;modic virtues of Camphire are the only ones agreed upon, and it is for this, and &s;uch like di&s;puted &s;ub&s;tances, that we mu&s;t make a di&s;tinct head of Anti&s;pa&s;modics.</P>
<P>As anti&s;pa&s;modic, it has frequently been employed in the hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e, and complaints of the hypochondriac kind, and wherever the&s;e are purely &s;pa&s;modic, in a proper do&s;e, it may be of &s;ervice. Camphire has al&s;o been employed in <HI>Mania.</HI> Dr. Kinnear, in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, gives us &s;everal in&s;tances of <HI>Manias</HI> cured by it, when given in the do&s;e of half a drachm. I am ready to believe the Doctor's &s;ucce&s;s; but there are &s;everal different kinds of <HI>Mania,</HI> and, after &s;everal experiments, I cannot &s;ay the Camphire &s;ucceeded. Sometimes indeed it produced a quieter night and day, but never effected a cure; but in a di&s;ea&s;e &s;o ob&s;tinate, and &s;o adapted to violent remedies, the Camphire ought not too ha&s;tily to be rejected. Like other Anti&s;pa&s;modics, Camphire has not been much recom|mended in Epilep&s;y, perhaps from the uncertainty of its effects, and the great variety of cau&s;es from which that di&s;ea&s;e may proceed; and indeed I have &s;een it fail in Epilep&s;y. But in other ca&s;es I have &s;een its good effects, and where the fits were frequent, it often produced large intervals; and where the di&s;ea&s;e was in &s;ome mea&s;ure accident|al, ari&s;ing from pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, as fear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have &s;een it work a perfect cure.</P>
<P>The chief u&s;e of Camphire has been in Fever. Whether there it acts as an Anti&s;pa&s;modic, I &s;hall leave you to decide, Some ex|tend

it univer&s;ally to all Fevers, while others confine its u&s;e to tho&s;e of the malignant kind, recommend it even in the Plague it&s;elf, in putrid Fevers and all tho&s;e attended with Exanthemata, as the miliary, and petechial Fevers. In this country we have no proper malignant Fever, &s;o that I cannot &s;peak as to its u&s;e in the&s;e. We u&s;e it in the nervous Fever, where the <HI>vis vitae</HI> is &s;unk, and there find it of great &s;ervice, and I begin to think we &s;hould find it of &s;till greater, were we to employ it in larger do&s;es. Heucher, in his Di&s;&s;ertation, entitled, <HI>Ignis igne extinguendus,</HI> who appears to have much experience upon this &s;ubject, recommends Camphire in Fe|vers of all kinds, e&s;pecially the la&s;t we have mentioned. Pou|teau, who attends an ho&s;pital of lying-in women, in a book lately publi&s;hed, entitled, <HI>Melange de Chirurgie,</HI> tells us, that an epide|mic &s;eized upon the women, attacking them with Cholic and a Fever, who&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;hewed it of an inflammatory nature, and where, on di&s;&s;ection, the bowels were found inflamed, which in|flammation extended to the uterus, who&s;e inner membrane appeared livid and gangrenous. Here Mr. Pouteau exhibited Camphire, di&s;|&s;olved in oil, and made into a &s;yrup, in the quantity of five grains, of which three do&s;es were repeated in half an hour, and one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">e hours after, and &s;o on till about thirty grains a day, by which means he operated a perfect cure. As to the manner of action: In one woman, after delivery, who was &s;eized with a violent pain and cholic, and in whom the di&s;ea&s;e was urgent, the Camphire was given to the quantity of &s;ixty grains in half an hour, by which &s;he was entirely relieved; but upon being put to bed, was &s;eized with a palene&s;s and chillne&s;s, which &s;eemed to threaten in&s;tant expiration, which &s;ymptoms were relieved by warm wine, and the application of warm cloths. The coldne&s;s was without any <HI>fri&s;&s;on,</HI> or &s;hivering, and ended with a &s;weat, and the woman was quite well afterwards. An in&s;tance analogous to this has occurred to my&s;elf, of a maniac, who got forty grains of Camphire at once, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell down cold and pale, with a weak and &s;mall pul&s;e, but &s;oon after re|covered. Another in&s;tance of the effect of Camphire you may &s;ee in Dr. Hoffman, in the fir&s;t volume of his Con&s;ultations, in a ca&s;e entitled, <HI>De Camphorae in Do&s;i tres &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rupuli effectu.</HI> I have menti|oned

all the&s;e in&s;tances, to &s;hew the effects of Camphire as a Seda|tive, in weakening the motions of the &s;y&s;tem, in weakening the action of the heart and ve&s;&s;els. But to go o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the u&s;e of Camphire in Fevers. Pouteau alledges, that Camphire is of no u&s;e in a Phleg|mon, but in the Ery&s;ipelas is a perfect cure. He tells us it is of u&s;e in vernal Pleuri&s;ies and Perip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eumonies, which, he &s;ays, are of the ery&s;ipelatous kind, and that it was from &s;eeing in the ca&s;e of the women, the ery&s;ipelatous nature of the inflammation upon di&s;&s;ection, that led him then to the u&s;e of Camphire. This &s;ort of rea&s;oning is very doubtful. The Ery&s;ipelas and Phlegmon are very dif|ficult to di&s;tingui&s;h, and in our practice here we u&s;e Camphire promi&s;cuou&s;ly in all external inflammations, and &s;eemingly with equal &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ometimes an&s;wering and &s;ometimes failing. There is one ca&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in rheumatic affections, which approaches nearer to the phlegmonic nature, where we find the Camphire of parti|cular u&s;e. If externally the di&s;tinction between Ery&s;ipelas and Phlegmon is &s;o difficult, it mu&s;t be more &s;o internally. There are very few authors who take notice of internal Ery&s;ipelas. You may &s;ee an in&s;tance of it in Lommius; but &s;uch are very rare. It was therefore incumbent on Mr. Pouteau to di&s;tingu&s;h them; for Vernal Pleuri&s;ies and Peripneumonies are here, and, as far as I have been able to learn, even the torrid zone, of a general inflammatory nature. Nay, we may go farther, and &s;ay, that even Pouteau's di&s;&s;ections &s;eem to &s;hew the inflammation of a phlegmonic nature. If we can make any proper di&s;tinction between phlegmon and Ery&s;ipelas, it is this, that the Phlegmon is in the proper cellular membrane below the &s;kin, while Ery&s;ipelas is &s;ituated in the rete muco&s;um. Hence, then, we are rather to take Mr. Pouteau's facts as in&s;tances of the powers of Camphire in inflammatory ca&s;es in general. Although we cannot admit of the di&s;tinction here, yet there is another curious enough in&s;tance given by the &s;ame Gentleman. He tells us, that a Gangrene is &s;urrounded with an ery&s;ipelatous circle, which &s;eems to be the cau&s;e of its &s;preading, and that, on the exhibition of Cam|phire, the progre&s;s of the mortification is &s;topped, and the Ery&s;ipelas changed into a Phlegmon. So much for the u&s;e of Camphire,
<PB N="373" REF="014000_0379_0F928AF6B394D198">
in Fever. Hoffman, in his treati&s;e, <HI>De tuto Camphorae u&s;u interno,</HI> gives us a great many in&s;tances of Nervous Fevers cured by Cam|phire, and al&s;o &s;ome of the purely inflammatory kind. Here we do not employ it in the la&s;t mentioned ca&s;es. When the effects of Camphire are not evident, I imagine it is from not throwing it in &s;ufficient large do&s;es.</P>
<P>As a-kin to its effects in inflammatory ca&s;es, we &s;hall next men|tion the u&s;e of Camphire in Haemorrhages. Hoffman, and the German Phy&s;icians recommend it &s;trongly in Haemorrhages of all kinds, and when given in the do&s;e of half a drachm, it does not en|crea&s;e the frequency of the pul&s;e, and &s;o po&s;&s;ibly may be of advan|tage; but I have had no experience of it. This quality does not agree with another a&s;cribed to Camphire, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> promoting the men|&s;trual flux, which from its anti&s;pa&s;m die power it may. Neither is this ea&s;ily reconciled with another effect attributed to Camphire, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> giving fluidity to the blood. I could wi&s;h the experiments upon which &s;uch conclu&s;ions have been formed had been more accurately examined.</P>
<P>Hoffman mentions the u&s;e of Camphire in the <HI>Lues Venerea,</HI> in all its &s;tages, and even in a recent Gonorrhoea recommends it as a mo&s;t effectual remedy. Hoffman, in this ca&s;e, appears not to have &s;poken from his own practice, and, indeed, he talks very loo&s;ely upon the &s;ubject, and not conde&s;cending on the manner of exhibi|tion. Po&s;&s;ibly in the recent Gonorrhoea it might be rubbed exter|nally on the penis, in the manner of unction, in order to allay the in|flammation, which is the fir&s;t thing indicated in that di&s;ea&s;e and in the more advanced &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e might be joined with other diaphoretics. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome might think here of its acting in ano|ther way. Camphire has been &s;aid to weaken the genital powers. It is not ea&s;y from experience, to determine this. Some experiments mentioned in authors &s;eem directly to contradict it; and from the&s;e Camphire &s;eems rather to promote venery. However, if it has the power of allaying Inflammation, &s;topping Haemorrhage, and acting as a powerful Sedative to the &s;y&s;tem in general, I mu&s;t &s;ay I would expect that it &s;hould al&s;o weaken the genital parts.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="014000_0380_0F928AF6EA61ABA0">
This leads to another di&s;ea&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> where an inordinate venereal &s;timulus produces nocturnal pollutions or emi&s;&s;ions without erection. The cure here is extremely difficult, for the di&s;ea&s;e appears at|tended with a weakne&s;s of the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, and tho&s;e affected in the manner mentioned, are &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable Hypochondriacs I have &s;een. In fir&s;t treating this di&s;ea&s;e, I thought of interrupting the habit, and gave Opium in this inten|tion. Sometimes for once it would &s;top the recurrence, but on frequent exhibition I found it rather to encrea&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e from its &s;timulating and accumulating properties, I therefore had recour&s;e to Camphire, which I found have the de&s;ired effect. It was exhibited at bed-time, as anodyne, and the patient at other times took Chalybeates. The&s;e are the particular di&s;ea&s;es in which Camphire has been employed. We &s;hall now talk of &s;ome general qualities attributed to it.</P>
<P>Camphire has been &s;poken of for its &s;oporific virtue. In any quantity in which we give Camphire in the human body, I have never &s;een this effect. It is never evident, except when there is an irritation, which Camphire, by taking off, allows the natural tendency to take place. Another general quality attributed to Cam|phire is that of diaphoretic. Here, in &s;o far as diaphore&s;is may be promoted by relaxing the &s;urface of the body, and taking off &s;tricture, Camphire may be of u&s;e; but in &s;o far as a &s;timulus is wanting, Camphire is of none at all; and I have &s;een two &s;cruples of it given without any effect, and probably when diaphoretic in Fever, it acts by taking off the inflammation, the &s;timulus &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>Camphire has been &s;aid to be anti&s;eptic, and to this quality Pringle attributes its effect in malignant Fevers. From what we have &s;aid formerly, and Menghini's experiments, it is probable that Camphire acts on the &s;tomach; though if any &s;ub&s;tance in &s;mall quantity can be anti&s;eptic to our fluids, Camphire has a very good chance to be &s;o, as &s;o ea&s;ily diffu&s;ible and penetrating over the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>

of different production, yet of &s;imilar virtues. Its effects as anti|&s;pa&s;modic are now &s;ufficiently known.

There is one ca&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> The Tooth-ach, in which, if properly applied, it not only gives a momentary, but durable relief.

Hence AEther is properly preferred to it in all &s;pa&s;modic affections of the &s;tomach and <HI>primae viae.</HI> The method of exhibiting it, is by diffu&s;ion in water, by which means, if not di&s;&s;ipated, it will probably act more powerfully. How far its u&s;e might be extended to other &s;pa&s;modic ca&s;es, I do not know. Perhaps it might be employed in Epilep&s;y. In Fevers it is not employed; but if you con&s;ult Dr. Hoffman, you will find it often employed here; and in &s;o far as his te&s;timony is to be taken for a medicine of his own invention, (for the <HI>Liquor anodyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s mineralis</HI> is nothing el&s;e but AEther diffu&s;ed in Spirit of Wine,) and by which he was to obtain profit, it is found of con&s;iderable virtues.</P>

matter. Procured with all the art po&s;&s;ible, E&s;&s;ential Oils are liable to &s;uffer con&s;iderable changes on being kept, and to lo&s;e their <HI>&s;piri|tus rector</HI> and medical portion, unle&s;s accurately &s;ecured from the air. The <HI>&s;piritus rector</HI> has, indeed, gone off, but in incon&s;iderable quantity, but the remainder is &s;o entangled in the now thickened oil, as not to exert its medical virtues. All this &s;hews us, that if we depend on any virtues in the E&s;&s;ential Oils, we mu&s;t u&s;e them as recent as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The virtues of E&s;&s;ential Oils are generally tho&s;e of the Plants, from which they are derived. Formerly it was &s;uppo&s;ed they con|tained all the virtues of their re&s;pective &s;ubjects, and hence were called E&s;&s;ences; but this we now find is the ca&s;e with very few. The virtues of plants are not always confined to the&s;e odorous parts. We are not to expect the A&s;tringency of Cinnamon in its E&s;&s;ential Oil, or the Bitterne&s;s of Wormwood. Hence it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, we could talk in general of the virtues of E&s;&s;ential Oils as di&s;tinct; but there are not yet a &s;ufficient number of ex|periments to enable us to attempt this, or to determine their differences.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ential Oils are chiefly taken from the cla&s;s of Stimulants. The <HI>Verticillatae</HI> all give out an E&s;&s;ential Oil, the virtues of which are more in common than that of the Plants them&s;elves; for the&s;e often have their di&s;tingui&s;hing property depending on a more fixed part. With regard to the <HI>Umbellatae,</HI> the &s;ame &s;eems to take place; but &s;ufficient experiments have not been made to deter|mine, whether the E&s;&s;ential Oils of this cla&s;s partake of its poi&s;onous qualities. The <HI>Siliquo&s;ae</HI> are not commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to contain an E&s;&s;ential Oil, but accurate experiments now &s;hew that they do, and that an E&s;&s;ential Oil, of a valuable kind probably, as very volatile, pungent, and diffu&s;ible, and the more volatile and penetrating the parts, the more anti&s;pa&s;modic virtues we find. The <HI>&s;piritus rector</HI> is very copious in Mu&s;tard and Hor&s;e-radi&s;h, and &s;o al&s;o is, probably, in their E&s;&s;ential Oil. The &s;ame ob&s;erva|tions
<PB N="379" REF="014000_0385_0F928AFD90E95880">
po&s;&s;ibly apply to the oils of the <HI>Alliaciae.</HI> A particular kind of E&s;&s;ential Oils is got from the <HI>Coniferae,</HI> affording us the &s;everal bal&s;amic &s;ub&s;tances. The Oils of the aromatic cla&s;s approach to the nature of Camphire. The Oils of other &s;ub&s;tances have different virtues, which will be under&s;tood from what we have &s;aid of the virtues of their re&s;pective plants re&s;iding in a volatile or fixed part.</P>
<P>All the E&s;&s;ential Oils have been introduced as anti&s;pa&s;modic, but fall &s;hort of Camphire, Empyreumatic Oils, or AEther. Their ac|tion is more confined to the part to which they are applied, and hence they are more remarkable as Carminatives, than in their effects on the &s;y&s;tem. They, too, have more of a &s;timulus than any of the &s;ub&s;tances we have been mentioning, and therefore they &s;hould be given to the torpid and flaccid, and not to the inflamma|tory.</P>
<P>From their not containing all the virtues of the &s;ubjects from whence they are drawn, and from their frequent adulteration, a great many of the E&s;&s;ential Oils have been rejected from practice, and even tho&s;e which are &s;till in our di&s;pen&s;atories, rarely occur in pre&s;cription. We are, however, apt to run into exce&s;s, both in our favours and prejudices, and po&s;&s;ibly there may be exceptions to our general rules. What we have &s;aid of E&s;&s;ential Oils applies &s;till more to di&s;tilled waters; for the impregnation in them is incon&s;i|derable, in&s;omuch, that little virtues are now expected from them. Even here, however, there are exceptions, and we &s;ee Pepper-mint water is a very valuable medicine, both as carminative and anti&s;pa&s;|modic in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and this virtue probably is more active in the water than in the E&s;&s;ential Oils. This is &s;omewhat contra|dictory to what we were ju&s;t now &s;aying; but certain it is, that &s;everal plants have their E&s;&s;ential Oils and di&s;tilled Waters more active than in the plant in &s;ub&s;tance. A glaring in&s;tance we have of this in the <HI>Lauro-cera&s;us,</HI> which Langri&s;h found of &s;uch perni|cious properties in di&s;tilled Waters, and of a much milder nature when exhibited in &s;ub&s;tance.</P>

<HEAD>MUSK.</HEAD>
<P>As approaching to the former &s;ub&s;tances in virtues, I chu&s;e to treat of Mu&s;k here. Mu&s;k is among the few medicines afforded us by the animal kingdom. It is an animal &s;ub&s;tance of a peculiar kind, containing a con&s;iderable portion of E&s;&s;ential Oil, and on that ac|count belonging to the anti&s;pa&s;modic cla&s;s. It is extremely volatile, quickly diffu&s;ed, the mo&s;t odoriferous &s;ub&s;tance in nature, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t retentive of its odour. Mu&s;k has long &s;tood in the li&s;t of officinal medicines, but its virtues, I imagine, have not been known till of late; for which we are entirely obliged to the Chine&s;e. As by them taught to exhibit it in a large do&s;e, we have found it a valuable anti&s;pa&s;modic, and indeed have u&s;ed it in all kinds of &s;pa&s;modic affections. We have employed it in hy&s;teric and hypohondriac affections, which we are very apt to think always to take place, when there are &s;pa&s;modic affections of the alimentary canal; whereas they often proceed from Gout; but even here Mu&s;k has been found of advantage, and it has been known to cure a Gout in the &s;tomach, as may be &s;een in the London E&s;&s;ays. In &s;hort, it is limited to no &s;pa&s;modic affection. It has been found of advantage in the Hiccup, and from Hillary we learn, in tho&s;e violent &s;pa&s;mo|dic affections called the <HI>Colica pictonum.</HI> The analogy has not been extended to the <HI>Ileus,</HI> though I think it may. Mu&s;k is often u&s;eful in Epilep&s;y, but with the &s;ame re&s;triction as we have given already upon the u&s;e of Empyruematic Oils there. In the <HI>Tetanos,</HI> we learn from Hillary, that Mu&s;k, conjoined with Opium, is an effectual remedy. The Mu&s;k, as we now employ it, was chiefly intoduced for its effects in the <HI>Rabies canina,</HI> by the Chine&s;e, and its efficacy here is now &s;ufficiently known; and, indeed, we have rea&s;on to imagine it would be &s;ucce&s;sfully employed there, as it is pretty gene|rally thought, that this di&s;ea&s;e is only to be con&s;idered as a &s;pa&s;modic affection; and wherever we are doubtful of the nature of the di&s;|ea&s;e, we may rea&s;onably deduce it from the nature of the remedy employed.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="014000_0387_0F928AFEE5028878">
In Fever, too, Mu&s;k has been exhibited. Whether this is always to be con&s;idered as a &s;pa&s;modic affection, I &s;hall not determine; but wherever the&s;e occur, accompanied with tremors, <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus tendinum, &amp;c.</HI> Mu&s;k not only is effectual in relieving the&s;e, but in taking off the Fever it&s;elf. From Dr. Wall's practice we find it has been of u&s;e, where an inflammatory diathe&s;is is pre&s;ent; but whether pro|perly it ought to be employed in &s;uch ca&s;e, I &s;hall not determine. In all the nervous and malignant Fevers, Mu&s;k is of &s;ignal advan|tage; and Mr. Reid has found it of great efficacy in the jail di&s;tem|per. I wonder Dr. Pringle &s;ays nothing of its u&s;e in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. From this, however, I would conclude, he has no material objecti|on to it. He gives, indeed, an in&s;tance, where its effects, he &s;ays, were not &s;o &s;udden as in Mr. Reid's ca&s;es, but this was far from making a fair trial.</P>
<P>There is one other di&s;ea&s;e in which Mu&s;k has been employed, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in <HI>Mania.</HI> This di&s;ea&s;e often depends upon cau&s;es not to be removed by any medicine, and is often hereditary. In &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, Mu&s;k, like other remedies, fails: But I have &s;een Mu&s;k have more effect than any other remedy. I have &s;een a cure ob|tained by it; and in other ca&s;es it would probably have the &s;ame effect, had the do&s;e been largely continued.</P>

<P>Civet is an odorous, oily, animal &s;ub&s;tance, which we may there|fore &s;uppo&s;e of &s;imilar virtues to Mu&s;k; but I know nothing in practice that either confirms or confutes this analogy.</P>

<P>This is more frequently employed. It has its virtues depending on an E&s;&s;ential Oil. Be&s;ides this and the two former, I know few animal &s;ub&s;tances of the &s;ame kind. In the Ca&s;tor the odour is not &s;o volatile, and is of the foetid kind, which has been &s;uppo&s;ed the foundation of its anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue; but from the analogy of Mu&s;k
<PB N="382" REF="014000_0388_0F928AFF2D485C88">
we &s;ee, that agreeable odours may be anti&s;pa&s;modic as well as fetid. Ca&s;tor has been employed as an antihy&s;teric, and in feveri&s;h ca&s;es. Like the E&s;&s;ential Oils it has a &s;timulant joined with an anti&s;pa&s;|modic quality, and is often more hurtful by the former than ad|vantageous by the latter. Its anti&s;pa&s;modic qualities otherwi&s;e are by no means remarkable, whence it is, that Ca&s;tor of late has been much neglected in practice.</P>
<P>In our Di&s;pen&s;atory &s;tand both a &s;imple and compound tincture of Ca&s;tor, the former intended for tho&s;e with whom <HI>A&s;&s;a foetida</HI> di&s;agrees. There have been di&s;putes about the men&s;truum, but it is now agreed that pure Alcohol is be&s;t, and that any other men&s;truum extracts more of the di&s;agreeable, and le&s;s of the u&s;eful parts. Our College, in the compound tincture, have attempted a refinement, and ordered the extraction to be made by the <HI>Spiritus volatilis oleo&s;us,</HI> but this limits the do&s;e of the Ca&s;tor, and weakens the &s;pirit, which gives us a weaker impregnation.</P>
<P>The next thing we con&s;ider is the proportion; and in ordering a greater quantity of Ca&s;tor, the Edinburgh college is the more ju|dicious. Nay, Alcohol will di&s;&s;olve more Ca&s;tor than is commonly imagined. The fir&s;t extraction is of the mo&s;t &s;ubtile kind, the others le&s;s u&s;eful, and more di&s;agreeable. Hence I think we might employ cohobation; emloy, <HI>e. g.</HI> one pound of Alcohol, to extract one ounce of Ca&s;tor, and then apply the &s;ame Alcohol to fre&s;h parcels of the drug.</P>

<P>We have, in the account of the &s;ub&s;tance in the Catalogue, been obliged to tran&s;po&s;e a little, in order to bring our mo&s;t powerful An|ti&s;pa&s;modics together.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;&s;umuniar</HI> &s;hould not have &s;tood in this part of our li&s;t, but along with the <HI>Zedoary</HI> and <HI>Serpentaria.</HI> With the Zedoary it agrees both in botanical analogy and &s;en&s;ible qualities, and hence its
<PB N="383" REF="014000_0389_0F928AFFE64082D0">
virtues may be deduced. It is now, however, di&s;regarded, though formerly in high reputation, on account of that favour we &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;tow upon exotic medicines.</P>
<P><HI>Paeony</HI> has long &s;tood in our li&s;ts, but I can find no writer or practitioner who can give te&s;timony of its virtues from particular experience. Be&s;ides, there is a &s;u&s;picion of its poi&s;onous qualities, and botanical analogy in&s;erts it into an acrid cla&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Valeriana Sylve&s;tris</HI> is the only one of the three which is at pre|&s;ent in repute as an Anti&s;pa&s;modic. It was introduced on the au|thority of Fabius Columna, one of the re&s;torers of botanical know|ledge, and a man of indu&s;try and di&s;cernment. He tells us, he cured him&s;elf of an Epilep&s;y by it. It was afterwards di&s;regarded, but is now u&s;ed in every &s;pecies of &s;pa&s;modic affection. Its ordour &s;eems to point out this quality; but for my part, after having &s;een it employed in a number of ca&s;es, it has failed altogether, or produced very incon&s;iderable effects. Phy&s;icians acknowledge this, but &s;ay it is owing to the &s;mallne&s;s of the do&s;e. Linnaeus, who &s;eems to have had a good opinion of Valerian, marks, as the medium do&s;e, two drachms of the root in powder. I have given to the quantity of half an ounce, without any effect. However, I am apt to think this might be owing to the badne&s;s of the medicine. Valerian is only perfect when it is taken up in the &s;pring, before its leaves are &s;hot out; whereas we commonly get it as taken up at the end of &s;ummer, when it is flowering. When in proper condition, it is alledged to be gently purgative and diuretic. It contains a con&s;iderable portion of &s;aline matter, which &s;upports its diuretic virtue.</P>
<P>The do&s;e in which Valerian mu&s;t be exhibited in &s;ub&s;tance, &s;hews that little advantage can be got in extracting it by any men&s;truum, as we can hardly get one in which it could be taken in &s;ufficient quantity. Hence the impropriety of Alcohol, Brandy, or even Wine. Water is the only men&s;truum by which we can extract it, and at the &s;ame time could exhibit it, thus extracted, in &s;ufficient
<PB N="384" REF="014000_0390_0F928B00B02E9458">
quantity. The London College infu&s;e it in <HI>Spt. volatilis aromaticus,</HI> but it is plain that this mu&s;t give but a weak impregnation, that the impregnation got can only be exhibited in very &s;mall do&s;es, and that the whole of its virtues mu&s;t depend upon the men&s;truum. It is the chief ingredient in our <HI>Tinctura Cephalica.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="antispasmodic">
<HEAD>VOLATILE ALKALI.</HEAD>
<P>I have &s;aid that the anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue re&s;ided in E&s;&s;ential Oil. There &s;eems an exception with regard to the volatile alkaline &s;alts, but if we con&s;ider their origin, and inflammability with nitre, this exception will not appear &s;o &s;triking as would be at fir&s;t imagin|ed. As Mu&s;k is the mo&s;t odoriferous of natural &s;ub&s;tances, &s;o Vola|tile Alkali is the mo&s;t odoriferous of the artificial. Upon this footing it has been frequently experienced a powerful Anti&s;pa&s;modic. It is con&s;iderably acrid when applied to the tongue, and that in incon&s;i|derable quantity; but if by any means we could defend from its action the mouth and fauces, it might be thrown into the &s;tomach in a large do&s;e, even without inconvenience. From its volatility and &s;ubtilty it proves the quicke&s;t Anti&s;pa&s;modic in the &s;tomach in nervous affections. I have &s;aid the&s;e &s;pa&s;modic affections often de|pend upon Gout.</P>
<P>Hence it is employed in all ca&s;es of Fever, where Simulants and Anti&s;pa&s;modics are nece&s;&s;ary. In con&s;equence of tho&s;e virtues, it is a powerful Diaphoritic. On this account it has been &s;aid to be alexiphermic, or expelling poi&s;on and contagion of all kinds. Now we know that in the ca&s;e of poi&s;on, as well as many others, we ought not &s;o much to regard the cau&s;e as the effects, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the &s;pa&s;|modic affections, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> commonly produced. It is on this account Ju&s;&s;ieu, in France, has found the Volatile Alkali, after repeated trials, &s;o u&s;eful in obviating the effects of the bite of the viper. Thus from the nature of the remedy, we may fairly make a judgment of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e. But with regard to its effects in deter|mining to the &s;urface. The danger of Fevers depends mo&s;tly on
<PB N="385" REF="014000_0391_0F928B01A1480500">
the cold fit, and it is in the cold fit of Intermittents that mo&s;t people die. To relieve this, we have not many medicines, but the Volatile Alkali is employed with advantage. This cold fit appears in various forms, and I have &s;een it often appear in a &s;traitening of the che&s;t, and cough. The Volatile Alkali given here, brings on an agreeable heat, and determines powerfully to the &s;urface. It is al&s;o recom|mended as pectoral on the &s;ame footing. We cannot omit &s;aying &s;omewhat here as to the anti&s;eptic quality attributed to it by Pringle. It is as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this virtue, that he employs it in malignant and putrid Fever; but it is evident, from the &s;mall quantity in which it acts, and the &s;uddene&s;s of the operation, that, as anti&s;eptic to our fluids, it is of no efficacy, and that it acts almo&s;t entirely in the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>Formerly it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the Volatile Alkali differed accord|ing to the &s;ub&s;tances from which it was procured; but now we know, that, if equally pure, it is always one and the &s;ame. Got from Sal Ammoniac, it is pure; as procured from animal &s;ub&s;tances, it is contaminated with empyreumatic oil, and perhaps that oil con|tributes to its virtues; but &s;urely the difference cannot be great; and if we want to join &s;uch an Anti&s;pa&s;modic along with it, we &s;hould chu&s;e one who&s;e do&s;e and effects we can better a&s;certain, <HI>e. g.</HI> the <HI>Oleum animale.</HI> But there is another more con&s;iderable dif|ference, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> as it is employed in its cau&s;tic, or mild &s;tate. Cer|tainly, as an application to the no&s;trils, the former is preferable, and the French practice with <HI>Eau de Luce,</HI> confirmed, indeed, by our own experience, &s;hews the u&s;efulne&s;s of it in that condition. It acts without inconvenience, and more &s;uddenly, which is a great matter; and indeed I make no doubt, but that in almo&s;t all ca&s;es it would be preferable, could we defend from its acrimony the mouth and fauces.</P>

ar&s;enical matter, however, may accompany frequently the fo&s;&s;ile Soot, volatilized from the pyrites contained in fo&s;&s;ile inflammables, and therefore a proper caution is nece&s;&s;ary when we u&s;e it as a me|dicine. Soot is a very heterogeneous &s;ub&s;tance, containing, be&s;ides Sal Ammoniac, a quantity of naked Volatile Alkali, enveloped more or le&s;s in an empyreumatic oil. The Volatile Alkali is very apt to fly off, and hence we &s;hould u&s;e the Soot as fre&s;h as po&s;&s;ible. Even as the Volatile Alkali and Oil &s;tand in Soot, they are certainly anti&s;pa&s;modic; and I have known ob&s;tinate head-achs cured by the u&s;e of Soot, in the do&s;e of half a drachm, continued for &s;ome days; but then in other ca&s;es it failed in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>As Fuligo even fails in &s;ub&s;tance, much more will it do &s;o in the weak impregnation obtained by tincture. The <HI>A&s;&s;a foetida</HI> joined to it may be of &s;ome advantage, but that can be very little. The London College gives us a tincture of <HI>A&s;&s;a foetida</HI> with Soot, which may be u&s;eful, as the men&s;truum employed extracts the E&s;&s;ential Oil, on which its virtues depend; but even there the do&s;e is limited by the men&s;truum.</P>

<P><HI>A&s;tringents</HI> are anti&s;pa&s;modic, by taking off the laxity on which mobility depends. All our Anti&s;pa&s;modics are only effectual in the time of the fit. It is A&s;tringents which we mu&s;t u&s;e to obviate the return of &s;pa&s;m, and when &s;pa&s;m occurs, Anti&s;pa&s;modics. To ob|viate Spa&s;m we u&s;e Iron, Lead, Copper, and Peruvian Bark. Spa&s;m may &s;ometimes, be owing to an over di&s;tention, as well as laxity, and hence <HI>Emollients,</HI> by relaxing the &s;imple &s;olids, may take off the continuance of the Spa&s;m. A very frequent cau&s;e of Spa&s;m is Acrimony. <HI>Demulcents,</HI> by obtunding this, will take off the Spa&s;m, by le&s;&s;ening or removing the cau&s;e.

<HEAD>On the NATURE of ANIMAL FLUIDS.</HEAD>
<P>This I con&s;ider as the mo&s;t difficult part of the ta&s;k in which I have been engaged. Mo&s;t of what has been &s;aid or wrote upon this &s;ubject is very imperfect. There was no book in which I expected more than the &s;econd volume of Haller's Phy&s;iology; but as a compilation, I find it only collected from tho&s;e, who&s;e views are not opened on the &s;ubject, and &s;till leaving us as uncertain as before. Perhaps more is contained in that book than any where el&s;e; but there is &s;carcely a page in which I cannot &s;ee faults, in which I cannot point out errors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We would wi&s;h to &s;ay here, that this cen&s;ure of Dr. Haller's works mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be &s;trictly confined to tho&s;e parts of it only which relate to the chemical doctrine of the fluids; for we know that in other re&s;pects our Author has a high e&s;teem of the judgment and erudi|tion of Dr. Haller.</NOTE>. There are two other authors from whom
<PB N="388" REF="014000_0394_0F928B06D8107DF0">
materials may be drawn; Gaubius, in his Pathology, and Senac, in his treati&s;e <HI>Du Coeur.</HI> Even in the&s;e, however, the materials are involved in ob&s;curity, or error. Formerly I intended to have taken Gaubius for a text, but I found I &s;hould be &s;o often engaged in critici&s;m, that it would have been very di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e who are engaged in the beginning of &s;tudy. I do not pretend to correct the errors of the&s;e writers, but only to point out what I think is fully e&s;tabli&s;hed on the &s;ubject. All the fluids in animal bodies mu&s;t be, if not formally, yet materially pre&s;ent in the common ma&s;s of blood. In con&s;idering this, then, we con&s;ider the foundation of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the common ma&s;s of blood three different portions may be di&s;cerned. Fir&s;t, the coagulable lymph; &s;econdly, the red glo|bules; thirdly, the &s;ero&s;ity. The&s;e three portions are con&s;tantly ob&s;ervable in the blood of animals. There are, indeed, a &s;et of animals called the <HI>Ex&s;anguia,</HI> but I find that there are very few of the&s;e, even tho&s;e of the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ect tribe, but what contain more or le&s;s of the abovementioned portions. Although the&s;e be the proper con|&s;tituant parts of animal blood, yet it mu&s;t be allowed there are &s;e|veral others occa&s;ionally pre&s;ent, as, <HI>e. g.</HI> a quantity of una&s;&s;imi|lated chyle, and, though not &s;o con&s;tantly, a quantity of reab&s;or|bed &s;ecreted liquors, either of tho&s;e intended to be thrown out of the body, or of tho&s;e &s;ecreted into particular cavities, for particular purpo&s;es. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there may be, on various occa&s;ions, a num|ber of extraneous matters, not capable of being converted into animal fluids, taken in with our aliment, or given in the way of medicine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are conveyed out of the &s;y&s;tem, as &s;oon as the laws of the oeconomy admit. The&s;e we &s;hall talk of afterwards. At pre&s;ent we proceed to con&s;ider tho&s;e principal portions we have mentioned; and fir&s;t,</P>

<HEAD>COAGULABLE LYMPH.</HEAD>
<P>This was fir&s;t taken notice of by Malphigi, under the title of the <HI>Pars fibro&s;a &s;anguinis,</HI> and is what Davies and others call the
<PB N="389" REF="014000_0395_0F928B076A37C8F8">
<HI>Gluten.</HI> I keep to the term impo&s;ed by Senac, before who&s;e writings it had not been taken notice of as a con&s;tant con&s;tituent part of the blood. That it is always pre&s;ent, is &s;hewn by ea&s;y experiments, by wa&s;hing the <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum,</HI> by agitating the blood drawn from veins or arteries in a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el, and pouring off the other parts from it, and by coagulating the &s;erum. In is al&s;o found both in the di&s;ea&s;ed and healthy, appearing in the form of what is called inflammatory cru&s;t.</P>
<P>From examining it, in con&s;equence of the experiments above|mentioned, it appears to be that portion of the blood mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to concrete upon &s;tagnation, or cooling of the whole; and, there|fore, the foundation of the concretion in extrava&s;ated blood. From concreting along with the colouring parts, it has commonly e&s;caped the notice of Phy&s;icians. When freed of this colouring part, it appears more or le&s;s white, perfectly mild and bland, re&s;embling, in &s;en&s;ible qualities, and chemical principles, the <HI>albumen ovi</HI> of oviparous animals; whence I conclude them to be entirely the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tances, only that the coagulable lymph can never be got &s;o accurately &s;eparated, as the <HI>albumen ovi.</HI> As that &s;erves for the nouri&s;hment of the chick, &s;o the coagulable lymph is the nutritious part of animal fluid, that into which our aliment is converted, and that in con&s;equence of who&s;e changes the &s;olid parts of the body are formed. This is confirmed when we compare it with animal &s;olids, which, upon chemical trials, and other ap|pearances, are evidently one and the &s;ame kind of matter. The co|agulable lymph is chiefly acted upon, or undergoes changes, in con&s;equence of heat, cold, or putrefaction. It is not to be changed by any &s;ub&s;tances which can be taken into the ve&s;&s;els of animals con&s;i&s;tent with life. It is, indeed, affected by concentrated acids, cau&s;tic alkali, and neutrals, but never with the&s;e when taken in by the mouth, and when injected into the ve&s;&s;els they produce death.</P>

<HEAD>2. RED GLOBULES.</HEAD>
<P>By former Phy&s;iologi&s;ts the&s;e were con&s;idered as a very great proportion of our fluids; but are now found, in compari&s;on with the whole, to come in but for a very &s;mall &s;hare. In other re&s;pects they are not near &s;o much the object of our attention as formerly; for the Lewenhoeckian doctrine now is entirely exploded, which no ob&s;ervation, even with the micro&s;cope, has confirmed, and which every later ob&s;ervation contradicts. Every experiment proves them to be a di&s;tinct part of the blood.</P>
<P>The chief property of red globules is, that they refu&s;e mixture, and are only diffu&s;ed in the other parts. With the &s;ero&s;ity they readily admit of diffu&s;ion; and though joined to the coagulable lymph, yet there is no intimate union, and the two portions can be ea&s;ily &s;eparated without re&s;olution of their mixture. It is on ac|count of this want of mi&s;cibility, that they appear in a globular form, in the &s;ame manner as oil in water, or, if the oil be in greater pro|portion, water in oil. We never can &s;ee the ultimate particles of bodies; and whenever we &s;ee a globular appearance in mixed bodies, we mu&s;t conclude it is only in con&s;equence of diffu&s;ion. Gaubius &s;uppo&s;es the red globules of an oily nature; but their more ready diffu&s;ibility with water, preferable to the &s;erum or coagulable lymph, contradicts this opinion. Neither, indeed, will they unite with oils, which holds true with no other oily body I know. It has been &s;aid they are inflammable, and give out much oil in di&s;til|lation; but again&s;t this it may rea&s;onably be alledged, that tho&s;e who made the experiment were not &s;ufficiently accurate in &s;epa|rating them from the other parts. Thus we have &s;aid what the red globules are not, I wi&s;h we could &s;ay what they are. We have called them globular, but Haller and Senac di&s;pute about this, the one calling them globular, the other lenticular. An|other que&s;tion has ari&s;en, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Whether every &s;ingle globule is of a red colour; or whether they only attain that when placed in a quantity above each other, in the &s;ame manner as happens in tinged

gla&s;s, which, if divided into thin films, becomes tran&s;parent and colourle&s;s; but if the&s;e tran&s;parent colourle&s;s films be laid above each other, the &s;ame colour as formerly again appears. Haller &s;ays, that the globules have &s;ingly their red colour; Senac the contrary. We may allow to Senac, that if the &s;ingle globules are red, they are but faintly &s;o, and that it depends chiefly on their being laid on one another; and that the deepne&s;s or brightne&s;s of the red depends on the diffu&s;ion or concentration of the red globules,. I am in|clined to think of their &s;eparate red colour; for in very &s;mall proportion they give colour to a large quantity of water. The na|ture of this part of our blood depends &s;o much on micro&s;copical ob|&s;ervations, and the&s;e are &s;o liable to error, that we cannot depend upon one particular which has been &s;aid concerning it. It is &s;aid that the red globules remain not only of the &s;ame &s;ize, in the &s;ame animal, at different times, but in all different animals at all times. If this were true, it would be very difficult to account for; but I imagine the fact is not accurately e&s;tabli&s;hed. Whether the colour of the red globules is heightened or le&s;&s;ened by particular circum|&s;tances, and what is the rea&s;on of the&s;e changes, is a great <HI>de&s;ide|atum;</HI> but not determined. That they are changed by putrefaction, may be allowed; but that ever their ultimate particles are changed, require confirmation, or that any medicines exi&s;t which have the power of altering their colour or form. In &s;hort, how the red globules are produced, to what purpo&s;e they &s;erve, in what proportion they exi&s;t, and by what powers they are altered, &s;eems altogether unknown.</P>

<HEAD>3. SEROSITY.</HEAD>
<P>Allowed to cool, the blood &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;eparates into <HI>Cra&s;&s;a|mentum</HI> and <HI>Serum.</HI> The&s;e are commonly thought homogeneous, but it is found the <HI>Cra&s;&s;amentum</HI> is compounded of the two la&s;t parts which we have mentioned, and the <HI>Serum</HI> of the <HI>Lympha coa|gulabilis,</HI> and the portion which by Senac has been properly called Sero&s;ity, or that watery part which runs out of the pores of the cut <HI>Serum</HI> when coagulated. It is ob&s;erved, that, when warm, the Se|rum
<PB N="392" REF="014000_0398_0F9289D644099990">
&s;hews both a ta&s;te and odour, which experiment finds to be owing to the &s;ero&s;ity, which con&s;i&s;ts of pure water with &s;aline mat|ters di&s;&s;olved, and probably a portion of an oily matter adhering, in which is found to po&s;&s;e&s;s the ta&s;te and odour mentioned, more or le&s;s &s;trongly, in proportion as it has been accurately &s;eparated from the coagulable lymph. The Sero&s;ity, then, is to be con&s;idered as a &s;eparate part of the blood, and from many circum&s;tances it ap|pears a-kin to the urine in the kidneys, and to be properly the ex|crementitious part of the blood. As putrefaction renders volatile, &s;aline and oily matters, it is no wonder how they come to exi&s;t in the &s;ero&s;ity. It is the&s;e which probably fly off in the <HI>halitus &s;an|guinis,</HI> which is not, as &s;ome have imagined, a di&s;tinct part, but found by experiment to be of the &s;ame nature with the Sero&s;ity. Whether a peculiar matter flies off along with the Sero&s;ity, is not &s;o ea&s;y to decide. Experiments &s;hew, that air is contained in the blood, but whether this be common or fixed air, is not determined. Shut up accurately in clo&s;e ve&s;&s;els, the blood remains remarkably fluid for a long time. Air is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the foundation of fluidity in water, and on both the&s;e accounts may perhaps be &s;up|po&s;ed the foundation of fluidity in our blood. The only author from whom you will, perhaps, gain any knowledge on the Sero&s;ity of the Blood, is Mr. Senac.</P>
<P>With regard to the union of the Sero&s;ity with the other parts of the blood. It pretty manife&s;tly does not unite with the red globules. I &s;aid that the red globules were wa&s;hed out with the Serum, but then they very &s;oon precipitate to the bottom. How far the Sero|&s;ity unites with the coagulable lymph, is not &s;o certain. It is plain that a portion of the coagulable lymph &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;eparates from the Sero&s;ity, to form the <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum,</HI> but then another part goes along with the Sero&s;ity; but I imagine there is never between them a perfect union. The &s;ero&s;ity is always acrid, and whatever &s;ub|&s;tance, therefore, it is mixed with, it mu&s;t communicate that acrimo|ny to; but the coagulable lymph, &s;eparated from the Sero&s;ity, retains no &s;uch property. Again, when we coagulate the Serum, we find
<PB N="393" REF="014000_0399_0F9289D6EBA5A138">
the Sero&s;ity run out from the pores of the coagulable lymph, which &s;hews that it was only entangled in the &s;ame manner as the fluid vo|latile alkali coagulates with &s;pirit of wine. From this view we would be led to imagine, that the three parts of the blood are never joined by proper mixture, but only kept in union by motion and agitation. If this be confirmed by u&s;eful purpo&s;es deduced, as thence accruing to the animal oeconomy, it will appear more certain. The Sero&s;ity &s;eems de&s;igned to take off the putrid parts of the blood, and to furni&s;h the excrementitious &s;ecretions. If a proper mixture &s;hould take place, it would take off the nutritious coagulable lymph along with it, which we could not conceive to be &s;eparated by the &s;ecretory organs. Again, the Sero&s;ity &s;eems to hold any occa&s;ional matters which may exi&s;t in the blood, and which, by this means, are &s;oon carried off by the &s;ecretions, but otherwi&s;e would later the na|ture of the animal fluids. This &s;hews that matters, introduced into the ma&s;s of blood, can have little effect in altering i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, but may be, as they actually are, &s;oon di&s;covered in the &s;ecretion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e there is a portion of matter pretty con&s;tantly pre&s;ent in the body, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the oil which mu&s;t have been &s;ecreted from the common ma&s;s into the cellular texture and may again be reab&s;orbed. How this exi&s;ts in the blood is not determined; whether united with all the other parts of the blood before-mentioned, and &s;eparat|ed by the &s;ecretory organ; whether formally as well as materially pre&s;ent; or whether joined with the &s;ero&s;ity. It is this la&s;t opinion I am apt to favour, for we find often the oil formally pre&s;ent in the urine; we find, that in a due quantity the oil will act as a demulcent, and will take off, e. g. the acrimony of the mucus in the branchiae, whence we would be laid to conclude, that it is de&s;igned by nature to obviate the acrimony of the &s;ero&s;ity. Wherever there is a tendency to putrefaction, there the acrimony of the &s;ero&s;ity is encrea&s;ed, and there con&s;equently would be more occa&s;ion for the oil as a demulcent. Accordingly we find, that in ninety-nine Fevers of an hundred, there is an emaciation and an ab&s;orption of the oil from the cellular mem|brane.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="014000_0400_0F9289D945DCF230">
May we then conclude, that tho&s;e we have mentioned are the only con&s;tituent parts of the blood, or are there &s;till others? It has been &s;uppo&s;ed by Haller, Gaubius, and Senac, that there is a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> matter</HI> &s;imilar to the vegetable mucus; and the latter al&s;o &s;uppo&s;es what he calls a <HI>gelatinous matter.</HI> It will be proper to take notice of their arguments. We are daily taking in a quantity of vegetable aliment, which furni&s;hes a vegetable mucus, which may pa&s;s through the <HI>primae viae</HI> unchanged, and exi&s;t in the ma&s;s of blood. Indeed this &s;eems to be the ca&s;e; but then this mucus fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ats in the &s;ero&s;ity without furni&s;hing any nutritious fluid, and &s;o is thown out of the body. By the&s;e Gentlemen it has been &s;aid to furni&s;h the mucous &s;ecretions. If you look into Dr. Fordyce's <HI>The&s;is de Catarrho,</HI> you will find the &s;ecreted mucus has a great re|&s;emblance to the coagulable lymph, from &s;ome experiments, which indeed were made with a view to this very que&s;tion; a portion only of the &s;ero&s;ity being mixed along with it; and indeed every view of this &s;ubject &s;eems to confirm what is &s;hewn by the&s;e experi|ments. As a foundation, indeed, for his opinion, Senac alledged, that the mucus is pre&s;ent in the ma&s;s with the &s;ame qualities as &s;e|creted. He took a &s;tomach, and emulged from it a con&s;iderable quantity of mucus, more, he &s;ays, than could be contained in the follicles, and which, therefore, he concludes mu&s;t have been drawn directly from the blood. But who determined for Senac the capa|city of the follicles of the &s;tomach, or &s;hewed him, that, though that was not great, it might not be compen&s;ated by their number? Again, in any irritation applied to the excretories, the mucus runs out in a fluid &s;tate, and it is only in con&s;equence of &s;tagnation, that it attains its vi&s;cid con&s;i&s;tence. Hence, then, we are led to think, that any mucus Senac obtained from a dead animal, was only in con|&s;equence of its having &s;tagnated in the follicles of the &s;tomach. Be&s;ides, Senac always &s;uppo&s;es the mucous matter to exi&s;t formally in the ma&s;s of blood, whereas it is much more probable that it is formed in the &s;ecretory organs.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="014000_0401_0F9289DB74C362A0">
As to the <HI>gelatinous matter,</HI> it may be more &s;hortly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Senac only infers the pre&s;ence of this matter, from the nature of animal &s;olids, which are made up of the fluids, and are re&s;olved into a jelly different from the coagulable lymph, which jelly he concludes thence mu&s;t exi&s;t in the blood. But we never can fairly re&s;olve animal &s;olids; nay, as in the ca&s;e of vegetables, there is always a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;olution and re&s;olution, as will appear &s;uffi|ciently evident from the experiments of the Bologna Society, and of Geoffroy; &s;o that &s;till we may admit that animal &s;olids are com|po&s;ed of the coagulable lymph, although by rea&s;on of the re&s;olution which en&s;ues, we cannot extract it in its original form.</P>
<P>Having thus a&s;certained the <HI>con&s;tituent parts</HI> of our blood, it would be of advantage to determine the <HI>proportion.</HI> This, how|ever, cannot well be done. Although only diffu&s;ed or entangled, it is very difficult to di&s;join the parts of the blood, the &s;ero&s;ity en|tangling and being entangled in the coagulable lymph, and that again concreting with the red globules; and although the&s;e parts may be &s;eparated, yet never can the &s;eparation be made with that accuracy &s;ufficient to determine the proportion. Haller, when he examines the quantity of cruor, has no notion of its entangling the &s;ero&s;ity; and, in &s;hort, all the experiments which have been made before it was known of what parts the proportion was to be a&s;|&s;igned, mu&s;t go for nothing. <HI>En gros,</HI> the red globules &s;eem to be in &s;malle&s;t proportion, and the &s;ero&s;ity in greater than the coagu|lable lymph.</P>
<P>Here, then, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the changes the blood is apt to un|dergo, by &s;pontaneous or artificial &s;eparation. Nothing is more common than to judge of di&s;ea&s;es by the appearance and &s;eparation of the blood; but when we con&s;ider the variety of circum&s;tances which influence this &s;eparation, the &s;ize of the orifice, the manner in which the blood flows, the &s;hape and capacity of the ve&s;&s;el which receives it, the temperature of the air at the time, the air in which the blood is allowed to &s;tagnate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we mu&s;t ea&s;ily &s;ee that
<PB N="396" REF="014000_0402_0F9289DCB2AABFB8">
our judgment mu&s;t be very fallacious, when which of the&s;e different cau&s;es affects the &s;eparation at the time, is &s;o difficult to a&s;certain. Brown Langri&s;h has made many experiments to determine the judg|ment to be formed of di&s;ea&s;es from the appearance of the blood; but as he could not, and certainly was not aware of the cau&s;es, which varied the blood's appearance, I maintain his experiments mu&s;t go for nothing. May we not al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e, that the blood in the ve&s;&s;els is affected with very &s;mall changes, while the real nature and condition of the fluids is not altered? Senac gives us an in|&s;tance of blood's concreting, and forming a rope as it flowed from the vein, without its appearing that the patient laboured under any di&s;|ea&s;e. Again, a ligature kept on a limb for &s;ome time, will produce that inflammatory cru&s;t, which has always been con&s;idered as a morbid &s;tate of the blood. I had a patient affected with an Epilep&s;y, who had been accu&s;tomed to have blood drawn before the fit, at which time it appeared of the natural condition, but in an hour after, in the time of the fit, the blood drawn concreted, without any &s;pontaneous &s;epara|tion. Upon the whole, it will appear, that our judgment, with regard to the &s;tate of the fluids, is at pre&s;ent upon a very uncertain footing.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, the Sero&s;ity is a watery fluid, and therefore not apt to concrete, e&s;pecially on account of the &s;aline matters di&s;&s;olved in it. The red globules &s;hew no concreting di&s;po&s;ition, and it is therefore only the coagulable lymph, which, in its own nature, is ready to concrete. It will be therefore next curious to enquire, what are the means in the living body which prevent this concretion, and allow its pa&s;&s;age through the minute&s;t ve&s;&s;els. 1. From the view of the proportion, we may perceive that the diffu&s;ion of the more fluid parts will prevent the concretion of the re&s;t. 2. Whatever pre&s;erves the mixture, pre&s;erves the fluidity. This pre&s;ervation will then depend on agitation, and the action of the ve&s;&s;els. How much the&s;e take place, appears from experiments out of the body. If blood is kept in con&s;tant agitation, even below the animal heat, the fluidity will be pre&s;erved. 3. We mu&s;t take in, as a prevent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of concretion, the degree of heat in animal bodies, which, with a
<PB N="397" REF="014000_0403_0F9289DCEDCBA200">
certain degree of motion, and clo&s;e ve&s;&s;els, always take place in the animal oeconomy. Here we would be apt to re&s;t in explaining the fluidity in the ma&s;s of blood, but I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, &s;till upon im|perfect foundation. If we agitate vehemently blood in clo&s;e ve&s;|&s;els, the coagulable lymph is &s;eparated, and the other parts may be poured out from it. This coagulation even takes place in animal bodies, even when life and the natural heat &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. We con|&s;tantly find it in aneuri&s;mal &s;acs, and often taking place in the heart, under the name of <HI>polypus.</HI> However, I am apt to think the&s;e <HI>po|lypi</HI> do not &s;o often take place in living healthy bodies as is ima|gined, but are formed in the agonies of death, or immediately after it. Still, however, there are in&s;tances of their continuing for a length of time; <HI>i. e.</HI> in&s;tances where all the circum&s;tances we men|tioned as pre&s;erving the fluidity take place, and yet a concretion ob|tains. This is very difficult to explain. Perhaps this may illu&s;trate it. It is a curious fact in chemi&s;try, that when two bodies are joined by &s;olution, or diffu&s;ion, more particularly by the fir&s;t, as in a &s;atu|rated &s;olution of &s;alt, the chry&s;tallization will not take place, except where there is a contact with &s;ome third body, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the air, a &s;olid body immer&s;ed, the bottom, or &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el. Thus we &s;ee that if a dry body is put into the blood, a con&s;iderable concretion will be formed upon it, as in the whi&s;king of the blood with rods. Hence we are furni&s;hed, be&s;ides ligatures, with another means of &s;topping haemorrhage, and it is by furni&s;hing an opportunity to this concretion, that <HI>charpie</HI> acts, and probably agaric, who&s;e fine fibrous texture gives an occa&s;ion to the &s;eparation; for which rea&s;on, I ima|gine the &s;crapings of a hat would an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e. This &s;ame fact bears a curious application, and &s;eems probably to be the rea&s;on of the &s;eparation of &s;aline matters and air from water, upon filtration through &s;and.</P>
<P>But to proceed; this concretion does not take place in our ve&s;&s;els becau&s;e there is never a dry body in contact with them, a thin fluid, oozing out from their &s;ide, continually moi&s;tening them, of the &s;ame nature perhaps as the &s;ero&s;ity, and repelling the particles of the
<PB N="398" REF="014000_0404_0F9289DDB2606878">
blood. But why does not the coagulable lymph concrete to the &s;ides of ve&s;&s;els applied to receive the blood? Becau&s;e, probably, the heat pre&s;erves the fluidity for a little, and the &s;ero&s;ity gets it&s;elf inter|po&s;ed; but wherever there is a dry contact the concretion takes place. This dryne&s;s happens in the ve&s;&s;els, as in the ca&s;e of Inflam|mation, and probably al&s;o aneuri&s;mal &s;acs; and hence it is that I imagine, where <HI>polypi</HI> are found they are owing to a previous In|flammation. All this, however, is not &s;ufficient. Other con|cretions take place, and I &s;u&s;pect, that a violent agitation, produced in a particular portion of the blood, may produce them. Hence, then, concretion is not a con&s;equence of the ordinary circulation, becau&s;e there the powers are &s;o directed as to pre&s;erve the proper mixture and proper fluidity; whereas, in the agitation of a particular part of the blood, I conceive the &s;erum taking hold of the red globu|les, and allowing the lymph to concrete. But even in the progre&s;|&s;ive motion, it is po&s;&s;ible the agitation may go &s;o far as to give occa|&s;ion to the concretion of the &s;aid lymphatic part. In a healthy per&s;on, this does not take place, and the coagulable lymph does not &s;eparate from the red globules, but when violently agitated by inflammation the lymph gets up to the &s;urface and concretes by it&s;elf. This in|flammatory cru&s;t is no new matter generated by the inflammation, as &s;ome have imagined, nor is it then pre&s;ent in greater quantity. No experiments have been adduced to confirm the&s;e opinions. I have &s;aid, that it was very difficult to a&s;&s;ign the proportions of our blood, and therefore this que&s;tion ought properly to remain in doubt, as belonging to that head. In &s;pite of this, I believe we may take upon us to determine; for when this inflammatory cru&s;t is &s;een, the <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum</HI> is in le&s;s quantity and not &s;o firm. Neither, indeed, can we conceive in what manner &s;uch new matter can be generated. If a ligature produce the &s;ame appearance, we cannot imagine it ari&s;es from any change of aliment. As the &s;ero&s;ity is furni&s;hed by the coagulable lymph, and as we know &s;o little of the red globules, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, or at lea&s;t explain any change in the latter part, which &s;hould convert it into coagulable lymph, or in order to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, any retrograde change in the &s;ero&s;ity. It
<PB N="399" REF="014000_0405_0F9289DE77746558">
may here be a&s;ked, whether or not this cru&s;t is encrea&s;ed in den&s;ity? This I would deny; for in its &s;pontaneous &s;eparation it never ap|pears of greater den&s;ity, than when procured in the ordinary way. Nay, the force of cohe&s;ion in the particles of the coagulable lymph &s;eems rather dimini&s;hed; which gave occa&s;ion to the &s;eparation. In putrid Fevers, and &s;corbutic ca&s;es, this cru&s;t is very frequent, and there, as in other ca&s;es, depends on &s;ome change of the lymph, which cau&s;es an ea&s;y &s;eparation. The appearance of this cru&s;t is commonly, and may be taken as a &s;ign of inflammation; but it is by no means an univer&s;al one; for in healthy per&s;ons it will remain for a length of time, as, <HI>e. g.</HI> in the ca&s;e of child-bearing women. In Fevers, where there is no topical inflammation, the cru&s;t has commonly been &s;uppo&s;ed an indication of inflammatory diathe&s;is, and of blood letting. I would allow this, in &s;o far as we allowed the inflammatory cru&s;t as a &s;ign of inflammation. Formerly I u&s;ed to employ this appearance as a mark, whether a fever was nervous or inflammatory; and, indeed, it often an&s;wers; but now I find that it is not a con&s;tant mark, and that the Fevers, in which it appears, would often be the wor&s;e for having the evacuation pu&s;hed, and were of the nervous or putrid kind.</P>
<P>Having now &s;poken of the con&s;i&s;tence of our fluids in health, we proceed to con&s;ider their morbid variations, with regard to the two heads marked out in the Catalogue, of <HI>Attenuants</HI> and <HI>In&s;pi&s;&s;ants.</HI></P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the &s;ubtile ve&s;&s;els, through which the circu|lation is to be made, we would think, that only a fluid of extreme exility was fit for it; but we find that our fluids, which &s;eem not to be of a perfect fluidity, are capable even of filtrating along the &s;ides of the &s;imple fibres, through pores inconceivably &s;mall. There is, then, adapted to each animal a certain degree of fluidity, which mu&s;t be placed as a &s;tandard, from which deviations on either &s;ide may be produced. Where the con&s;i&s;tence is thicker than the na|tural, we call it lentor, where thinner, no technical term has been applied.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="014000_0406_0F9289DF4A361ED8">
Proper con&s;i&s;tence &s;eems to depend, fir&s;t, on the due proportion of the parts; &s;econdly, on the&s;e parts being kept accurately diffu&s;ed together; thirdly, on the due force of cohe&s;ion in the con&s;tituent parts of each.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Due proportion of the &s;everal parts.</HI> In order to produce len|tor, we &s;hould conceive this chiefly to ari&s;e from an over-proportion of coagulable lymph, and 1. from a large proportion of aliments, or convertible parts, thrown into bodies of &s;trong and rigid &s;olids, we might &s;uppo&s;e this encrea&s;ed quantity of coagulable lymph to take place; and, in fact, different proportions &s;eem to be in different animals, and if we examine them in gro&s;s, we &s;hall find, that the den&s;ity of the blood is in proportion to the &s;trength and vigour of the &s;olids, and therefore in proportion to the different age and &s;ex, and the&s;e being given, to the different temparament with regard to rigidity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but, as ari&s;ing from the&s;e cau&s;es, lentor will &s;eldom be a di&s;ea&s;e. Rigid and robu&s;t &s;olids require a &s;trong and den&s;e blood as a balance, nor indeed do I think it ever probable, that the natural powers can produce a di&s;ea&s;e. We may indeed &s;ee, that the coagu|lable lymph is in greater proportion where there are den&s;e &s;olids, but then the greater action of the&s;e &s;olids will prevent its concretion. Again, wherever the coagulable lymph is encrea&s;ed, it has the power of invi&s;cating the other parts, of preventing the &s;ecretions, and thus obviating the effects of lentor, and if at any time the &s;ecretions be di|mini&s;hed, the &s;aline parts mu&s;t be encrea&s;ed, mu&s;t become more and more putrid, and thereby occa&s;ion a greater fluidity of the whole. Although, however, we &s;hould allow, that an encrea&s;e of animal nouri&s;hment in weak per&s;ons may produce an encrea&s;e of coagulable lymph, yet even here the con&s;i&s;tence will not be much varied, for it will be counterbalanced by encrea&s;ed putrefaction le&s;&s;ening the co|he&s;ion. Upon the whole, there is little rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the ani|mal powers can produce lentor from encrea&s;ing coagulable lymph,
<PB N="401" REF="014000_0407_0F9289DFED83F270">
nor indeed do we know any matter which particularly furni&s;hes coagulable lymph, or that it can be procured by any means, but from our aliment.</P>
<P>What next will vary the con&s;i&s;tence, is the proportion of &s;erum. This may be dimini&s;hed either by too great evacuation, or by the ordinary evacuation not being &s;upplied by drink. With regard to the la&s;t, as the diminution of drink dimini&s;hes all the fluid &s;ecretions, its want is compen&s;ated. It may act al&s;o in another way. The fluid accompanying our aliment promotes its &s;olution: The le&s;s of this, therefore, we take in, le&s;s nouri&s;hment is extracted, and con&s;equent|ly le&s;s coagulable lymph is carried into the blood, &s;o that in either way, no encrea&s;e of the blood's den&s;ity is produced. I think this is confirmed by experience. I know many per&s;ons, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the female &s;ex, who take exceedingly little drink, and yet there blood is not more den&s;e than that of other people; and the &s;ame thing I have found to take place with my&s;elf, and, therefore, I think per&s;ons, in this re&s;pect, may be allowed their own choice, without &s;u&s;picion of any bad con&s;equences. Another counterpoi&s;e to the keeping back of fluid parts is, that the fluid &s;ecretions are di|mini&s;hed, as the urine and per&s;piration; from which retention of the &s;aline parts, a putre&s;cency takes place, which compen&s;ates entirely the effect of the diminution of drink on the con&s;i&s;tence. Next, with regard to the ab&s;traction of the fluid parts. In the living body there is no exhalation or di&s;&s;ipation of fluid parts but what is made by &s;e|cretion. Nothing is more talked of by Phy&s;icians, than that by the di&s;&s;ipation of the more fluid parts, an in&s;pi&s;&s;ation of the re&s;t is pro|duced; and yet I am of opinion, it very &s;eldom takes place. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable fluid &s;ecretion is that of urine, not, indeed, greater than per&s;piration, but more con&s;iderable, as made from a &s;maller portion of blood. Let us &s;uppo&s;e one drachm of blood goes through them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Kidneys.</NOTE> at every pul&s;ation of the heart, which let us &s;uppo&s;e &s;ixty-four times in a minute, then will eight ounces of blood pa&s;s
<PB N="402" REF="014000_0408_0F9289E0DD371488">
through the kidneys in a minute, which is a very moderate calcula|tion, con&s;idering the proximity of the emulgents to the heart, and thirty pounds in an hour. From this quantity let us &s;uppo&s;e four ounces of urine in an hour to be &s;eparated, which is a great propor|tion, making &s;ix pounds a day, then will the whole quantity &s;ecreted be only an hundred and twentieth part of the blood which &s;e|creted it, which can very little alter the con&s;i&s;tence. When &s;uch is the ca&s;e in the &s;ecretion of urine, where &s;o much is taken from &s;o little blood, much more will it take place in other more diffu&s;ed &s;ecretions. But when are the &s;ecretions encrea&s;ed? When there is a con&s;iderable quantity of fluid taken in. Again, when the &s;ecretions are encrea&s;ed, the encrea&s;e of one is always followed by the diminution of another, and the body becomes in an ab&s;orbent &s;tate, and attracts moi&s;ture from the air. Again, encrea&s;ed &s;ecretion is always followed by thir&s;t, and then a &s;upply of fluid is thrown in, or, if we are prevented from drink for any length of time, it never mi&s;&s;es to dimini&s;h the &s;ecretions. Hence, then, di&s;&s;ipation of the fluid parts can have little effect in producing lentor.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cau&s;e of Lentor may be a&s;&s;igned <HI>Defect of Motion.</HI> To this purpo&s;e it may be ob&s;erved, in the fir&s;t place, that if blood be received and kept in clo&s;e ve&s;&s;els, it retains as much fluidity as is con&s;i&s;tent with the cold to which it is expo&s;ed, &s;o that without exhalation, the fluidity is not much altered, and accordingly in the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els of a dead body the whole was fluid almo&s;t as in the living. Sometimes, indeed, in the larger ve&s;&s;els we do find coagula, but the&s;e are owing to particular cau&s;es, <HI>e. g.</HI> agitations in a particular part, or the agonies of death. In fact, we have not much to &s;u&s;pect from &s;mall &s;tagnation, unle&s;s &s;ome other circum&s;tances concur to favour &s;ome &s;ecretion; or if concretion &s;hould take place, fluidity is &s;oon re&s;tored by the action of the containing ve&s;&s;els, as in per&s;ons recovered from a long &s;yncope. This is mo&s;t remarkable in the &s;leeping animals, who&s;e fluids actually concrete during the winter, and are re&s;tored to
<PB N="403" REF="014000_0409_0F9289E16BC37DC0">
fluidity by the vernal warmth exciting the action of the ve&s;&s;els. Van Swieten clearly &s;hews, that in a bat's wing, which he exa|mined, the fir&s;t change was produced in the &s;olids, and that the grume accompanied their motion till it was totally di&s;&s;olved. Formerly we imagined, that when fluids were concreted beyond the ve&s;&s;els, as in Cancers and Scirrho&s;ities, that the di&s;ea&s;e was incurable; but late experience has happily &s;hewn this to be a mi&s;take, and awakes our remembrance to other facts of the &s;ame kind, long ago alledged. Such are the provi&s;ions we &s;ee afforded by the animal oeconomy, in order to avoid di&s;ea&s;e, in&s;omuch that hope need not fail us while life remains. Even when the blood &s;tagnates in &s;uch a manner as to favour concretion, as in Ecchy|mo&s;es, fal&s;e Aneuri&s;ms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we &s;ee there are undoubtedly &s;ome powers in the animal oeconomy, which re&s;tore fluidity, and cau&s;e ab&s;orption.</P>
<P>The third cau&s;e of Lentor may be <HI>an increa&s;ed Force of Cohe&s;ion</HI> in the coagulable lymph, or in any other part of our blood. This may ari&s;e, fir&s;t, from the nature of the fluids them&s;elves; or, &s;e|condly, coagulable &s;ub&s;tances applied; or, thirdly, coagulating powers, as cold. The fir&s;t may take place in con&s;equence of dif|ference of aliment, and vigour of the a&s;&s;imilatory powers; but in &s;o far as increa&s;ed cohe&s;ion ari&s;es from the&s;e, it is never a di&s;ea&s;e, for it is always in proportion to the &s;trength of the &s;olids. But aliment may be con&s;idered in another light, according to its per|&s;pirability; <HI>e. g.</HI> Oy&s;ters are more unper&s;pirable than mutton, which is explained from their greater vi&s;cidity in the blood. How far this may go on in producing a vi&s;cidity of the whole ma&s;s is uncertain. If the &s;ame aliment be not continued, the effect is &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on over; if the aliment is continued for a length of time, a di&s;ea&s;e indeed is produced, but then the retained per&s;piration obviates the vi&s;cidity, which would be apt to occur, by cau&s;ing putrefaction; and therefore it is a Scurvy, and not a lentor, which we mu&s;t apprehend from too vi&s;cid aliment.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="014000_0410_0F9289E4DC7C53F0">
The &s;econd means of encrea&s;ing cohe&s;ion was, by coagulating &s;ub&s;tances introduced into the blood.

It is plain, then, in &s;uch dilution and dif|fu&s;ion, the &s;en&s;ible effects of coagulating &s;ub&s;tances introduced by the mouth cannot be perceived. Injected, indeed, into the veins, they will exert their effects, but then this is not to be con&s;idered as a di&s;ea&s;e, and, in fact, is entirely incompatible with life. Dr. Boerhaave adds an in&s;tance of the effects of Gyp&s;um, which needs no animadver&s;ion here. Coagulum, then, in our fluid, from co|agulating &s;ub&s;tances, can never take place in the living body.</P>
<P>The third means of encrea&s;ing cohe&s;ion mentioned, was by coagulating powers applied, <HI>i. e.</HI> Cold or Heat. Why &s;uch op|po&s;ite degrees of the &s;ame power &s;hould have &s;uch &s;imilar effects, it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s here to enquire. The coagulating effects of neither of the&s;e on our fluids can take place in the living body. Cold cannot coagulate the fluids till it has de&s;troyed the action of the moving fibres, and the mobility of the nervous power, to which all its effects are to be imputed. On the other hand, coagulating heat can never take place till it has de&s;troyed the whole &s;y&s;tem, or the peculiar part to which it is applied. From the&s;e con&s;iderations it will appear, that though we cannot ab&s;olutely deny &s;uch effect upon the fluids, yet that it occurs much more rarely than was imagined, and that, when it does, it is not much to be regarded.</P>

Although not &s;trictly connected with this &s;ubject of <HI>Lentor,</HI> I cannot help taking notice, that Ob&s;truction has been con&s;idered as an univer&s;al cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e. Ob&s;truction may depend either on the thickened con&s;i&s;tence of the fluids, or the &s;traitening of the ve&s;&s;els.

<P>However, as I am not certain whether I can deny the&s;e altoge|ther, I have &s;et down in our li&s;t &s;uch as are &s;uppo&s;ed to have the&s;e properties. Attenuants may be of two kinds; 1.

<HEAD>WATER.</HEAD>
<P>Of this I am only to talk of the internal u&s;e. Externally, cold Water proves a &s;timulus to the moving fibres, and in the &s;ame manner acts internally on the &s;tomach, overcomes the <HI>plethora quoad vires,</HI> removes that load which an oppre&s;&s;ed &s;tomach gives to the &s;y&s;tem, promotes dige&s;tion, promotes evacuation of the faeces. It is in this way only we can explain a common application of it. Chocolate is a very vi&s;cid aliment, and apt to &s;tay long upon the &s;tomach; but if the u&s;e of it be followed with a draught of cold Water, it is ea&s;ily dige&s;ted. The efficacy of cold Water on the &s;tomach is diffu&s;ed over the &s;y&s;tem, and cau&s;es a determination to the &s;urface of the body; and indeed there is no means more effectual in procuring a &s;weat, than a large draught of cold Water. This I cannot explain, but may illu&s;trate it by the effects of the &s;aline draught, which has the &s;ame effect. Cold Water, too, will an&s;wer in relieving Vomiting, wherever the &s;aline draught is effectual, when vomiting depends on want of determination to the &s;urface of the body. The ancients employed cold Water to relieve the vomiting in Intermittent Fevers; and the &s;outhern nations &s;till u&s;e it for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Cold water has likewi&s;e been employed in con|tinued Fevers. The u&s;e of it here you mu&s;t &s;tudy in Lommius, and
<PB N="407" REF="014000_0413_0F9289E6A89B0500">
the ancients, and in the writings of the Phy&s;icians of Italy and Spain, who not only u&s;e cold Water, but Ice Water, and have be&s;towed whole volumes on the &s;ubject. As among the ancients di&s;putes aro&s;e, whether hot or cold water &s;hould be employed at different times, &s;o the&s;e di&s;putes &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t. What are the limits I cannot determine, from want of experience, and perhaps al&s;o, from not having con&s;ulted with &s;ufficient accuracy the authors I have men|tioned. Here is, however, one deci&s;ion which I can offer, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that in inflammatory Fevers, more e&s;pecially tho&s;e attended with topical inflammation, as Angina, Pleuri&s;y, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> cold water has often bad effects; but again, is u&s;eful in Fevers of the malignant, nervous, and putrid kind. In the northern countries our Fevers are more of the inflammatory kind, and therefore cold Water is not &s;o commonly u&s;ed; but perhaps not merely from the difference of the di&s;ea&s;e, but al&s;o from the Carte&s;ian theory, by which the u&s;e of warm Water was introduced along with the notion of lentor. However, there are certainly exceptions to this. We every day &s;ee the country people employ it with impunity, with advantage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This holds true, particularly in Autumnal Fevers, of which the poor are often by this means cured, while the rich go on in their di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE>, often exciting a &s;weat, which produces a &s;olution of the Fever. The&s;e are the effects of cold Water in the &s;tomach, and in con&s;equence on the &s;y&s;tem. One, however, &s;till remains, when cold Water is thrown into oily mat|ters, or where oil is diffu&s;ed, as an emul&s;ion, it immediately &s;eparates the oil, and does not allow the proper diffu&s;ion. Something of the &s;ame kind &s;eems to occur in the &s;tomach. I my&s;elf was once troub|led with weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach, in&s;omuch that oil would not &s;tay upon it, but flowed near the upper orifice, and was thrown up in pure oily inflammable eructations. Now though this di&s;ea&s;e is gone, I &s;till find upon a draught of cold water, the oil will &s;eparate as before, which can be explained on no other foundation, but that oil does not unite even with mucilaginous matter without triture, but is thus &s;e|parated by the cold Water.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="014000_0414_0F9289E76CD7D008">
As a diluent and &s;olvent, the advantage is entirely on the &s;ide of warm Water, which proves a &s;timulus to the &s;tomach, and by ex|peding &s;olution, mixture, and evacution of the &s;tomach, favours dige&s;tion very much, and hence we mu&s;t deduce the effects of Tea and Coffee for the &s;ame purpo&s;e after a full meal. But with the&s;e effects it produces a relaxation of the &s;tomach, who&s;e tone is in common to the whole of the &s;y&s;tem, and weakened, produces a tremor, extending the relaxation and heat over the whole &s;urface of the body, and producing diaphore&s;is and &s;weat. In inflammatory Fevers, then, and inflammatory Diathe&s;is, warm Water is very proper in the&s;e intentions; but in weak, lax, and flaccid habits is pernicious. Hence in the &s;ame per&s;ons, be&s;ides the ingredients them|&s;elves, we may &s;ee the bad effects of Tea and Coffee may al&s;o ari&s;e from the warm Water.</P>
<P>In the milder aromatics, with moderate re&s;triction, we &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ame effects of Tea in promoting dige&s;tion, without their relax|ing debilitating qualities. The&s;e are the effects of cold and warm Water in the &s;tomach, except what regards their emetic property, which properly comes under that head.</P>
<P>Carried from the &s;tomach into the inte&s;tines, their effects are en|tirely the &s;ame, becau&s;e when they have arrived there, the hot or cold Water has gained equally the temperature of the body. The effects of cold water in the &s;tomach may be propagated by con&s;ent into the inte&s;tines, but as taken down and materially pre&s;ent there, it differs nothing from warm water. In the inte&s;tines, Water pro|motes &s;olution, dilutes the chyle, and the vi&s;cid &s;tuff contained in them, and wa&s;hes off the mucus adhering to their internal &s;urface; by giving greater fluidity of their contents will favour ab&s;orption, and by encrea&s;ing their bulk the progre&s;s downwards, in&s;omuch as &s;ometimes even to prevent its own ab&s;orption. Given in con&s;idera|ble quantity, as in that of a Scots pint, by its bulk it will &s;o much encrea&s;e the peri&s;taltic motion, as to become purgative. This only can explain the purgative effect of &s;ome Mineral Waters, which often
<PB N="409" REF="014000_0415_0F9289E829FD86E8">
are &s;o, merely on account of the dilution in which their &s;aline mat|ters are held, and who&s;e effects can be encrea&s;ed by encrea&s;ing the dilution. Thus, one pound or two pounds of Mineral Water in which two drachms of Glauber's Salt is di&s;&s;olved, will prove more powerfully purgative, than half a pound, in which one ounce is di&s;|&s;olved. I am per&s;uaded, it is a mi&s;take to limit the do&s;e of our Mine|ral Waters of this kind, for we &s;ee the common people, who pour them down in large quantities, obtain their effects more remarkably, both with re&s;pect to their purgative as well as other properties. Cer|tainly this of Water is one of the &s;afe&s;t purgatives, acting merely by its bulk, without &s;timulating, inflammatory, or &s;edative weak|ening powers. Ab&s;orbed into the lacteals, Water mu&s;t dilute the chyle and favour its mixture with the lymph; but its effects are much more con&s;iderable in wa&s;hing out the me&s;enteric glands, that important part of the lacteal &s;y&s;tem. The Scrophula is now found to be a di&s;ea&s;e of the lymph, and often to effect the me&s;enteric glands, which Water will not only wa&s;h out, but encrea&s;e the action of their ve&s;&s;els. Mineral Water and Salt Water are mo&s;t noted for their effects in this di&s;ea&s;e, and, con&s;idering the weakne&s;s of their impregnation, and the great variety occuring in that where the effects have been found the &s;ame, we have great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that a con&s;iderable part of their virtue is to be imputed to Water. To this purpo&s;e I &s;hall give you a fact. I am ready to believe, with Ru&s;&s;el, that Sea Water cures more effectually than Mineral Water; but then from its im|pregnation it proves &s;o purgative, that thence its do&s;e is much limited. My practice is, both with children and adults, to join an equal quantity of Common to the Sea Water, and I find remarkable good effects from the addition. All this &s;eems to prove the action of the Water here to be that of wa&s;hing out the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Carried into the blood-ve&s;&s;els, Water expedes the freedom of the circulation, and promotes a more free &s;ecretion; but here there is no danger from its quantity, for it is &s;oon thrown out by the &s;ecretions it promotes. It increa&s;es the motion of the ve&s;&s;els, while at the &s;ame time it opens tho&s;e of the extremities to give way to the in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="410" REF="014000_0416_0F9289E8EA8B5F68">
impetus. It is one of the &s;afe&s;t Stimuli, and, by diluting the &s;aline and putre&s;cent matters in our fluids, checks their inte&s;tine mo|tion. By one and the other effect, it expedes every &s;ecretion, as has been mentioned, but more e&s;pecially the excrementitious &s;e|cretions of &s;weat and urine. By expeding the&s;e, it wa&s;hes acri|mony from the coagulable lymph, and di&s;charges that acrimony out of the &s;y&s;tem. By diluting the coagulable lymph, it &s;eems to faci|litate its application to &s;ubtiler parts, or its filtration along our &s;imple fibres. It is a certain fact, that calves, <HI>e. g.</HI> are much more nouri&s;hed by an equal quantity of milk and water, than by milk alone, which can only be explained from the water producing more ea&s;y appli|cation. We thus con&s;ider the effects of Water on every part of the &s;y&s;tem, and upon the whole, the u&s;e of it in di&s;ea&s;es. We &s;hall, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be ready to allow, with Hoffman, that the title of <HI>Panacea</HI> more properly belongs to it, than to mo&s;t other medicines.</P>

<P>This mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be given thus cau&s;tic, in order to have any effect on our fluids It di&s;&s;olves the coagulable lymph, and may be thrown in in greater proportion than alkali, but never can be given in &s;uch large quantity as to have any con&s;iderable action as attenuant. Be&s;ides, it is u&s;ed as a medicine, to obviate acidity, a proof that it is neutralized in the &s;tomach; from all which, with the alkali, it may be con&s;idered as exerting only its power in the kid|neys. Both this and Alkali have been &s;aid to di&s;&s;olve &s;tones. <HI>A priori,</HI> we &s;hould certainly deny this; <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI> we are very certain that in many ca&s;es they do not. Du Haen gives us an in|&s;tance of fifteen hundred weight of quick-lime being taken, be&s;ides many pounds of &s;oap, and all without any &s;en&s;ible action on the &s;tone. Lime-water, however, on the other hand, has been &s;aid as undoubtedly to di&s;&s;olve &s;tones, and calculous concretions of the kid|neys, but then the&s;e are of exceeding great variety, and in &s;ome the &s;olution may be obtained. I think I have &s;een &s;uch, where the urine was turbid, with greater quantity of &s;andy matter, and matter of a flaky appearance. Here, however, there might be a deception, and a &s;light change of urine might have had the effect; and indeed we mu&s;t allow, that many more experiments are wanted, and better directed ob&s;ervations. In many in&s;tances the pain and &s;trangury are relieved where there is no &s;olution; and indeed if we allow that the <HI>Uva Ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i</HI> can operate without that effect, we may admit that Lime-water and Alkali may operate in the &s;ame manner. Again

But I do not know how far this can be carried, for the den&s;ity of the blood depends very much on the &s;tate of the oeconomy with regard to the &s;olids. Thus a robu&s;t laborious man, who lives on vegetables, will have den&s;er blood than a fine gentleman who lives on animal food. Again, vegetables, as

<HEAD>INSPISSANTIA.</HEAD>
<P>Under the head of <HI>Attenuantia</HI> we have con&s;idered how far Lentor may take place. We are now to con&s;ider the deviation of the fluids towards the &s;ide of too great fluidity. This change mu&s;t depend on an over-proportion of fluid aliment, or a diminu|tion in the force of cohe&s;ion of our fluids. A defect of motion was &s;peciou&s;ly enough alledged to be the cau&s;e of Lentor, &s;o that an encrea&s;ed motion might be reckoned the cau&s;e of fluidity; but while the proportion of the parts remain, great motion will not alter it. Fluidity, then, depends chiefly on the proportion, which may be varied in two ways, either by the introduction of a great proportion of fluid aliment, or by the retention of the &s;ecretions.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the over-proportion of fluid aliment; if this be per|fectly mild, we have mentioned the &s;alutary effects that may ari&s;e from it, as that of encrea&s;ing the &s;ecretions, by which means the over-proportion would run off. It has been alledged, that, in|&s;tead of being carried out of the body, water may run off into the cellular membrane, or into the cavities, and produce Ana&s;arca or A&s;cites. From ob&s;ervation I never &s;aw a Drop&s;y ari&s;ing from this cau&s;e. Univer&s;ally it depends on a con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance made to the return of the venous blood, or a defect of ab&s;orption. Hence I would doubt whether ever an over-proportion of fluid aliment could produce di&s;ea&s;e. An over-proportion of warm liquors may certainly be hurtful, but then we mu&s;t a&s;cribe this to the relaxation they induce in the &s;tomach, and con&s;equently over the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="014000_0421_0F9289F1C20C23B0">
As to the retention of the &s;ecretions. If we could &s;uppo&s;e this to take place over the whole &s;y&s;tem, the effect would certainly fol|low, but this we cannot expect; and if the retention is only partial, it will always be compen&s;ated by the encrea&s;e of other &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>The fluidity of the blood may al&s;o be varied by the proportion and &s;tate of the more den&s;e and concreting parts of it, and the fluidity may be encrea&s;ed either by a defect of the&s;e parts, or by a diminution of their force of cohe&s;ion. A faulty proportion may occur from a defect of the more con&s;i&s;tent parts of the blood, by ab&s;tracting nou|ri&s;hment altogether, or to a defect of a&s;&s;imilation. As to the fir&s;t, it is doubtful how far fluidity may ari&s;e from this cau&s;e, con&s;idering how fruitful the animal oeconomy is in making pro|vi&s;ion again&s;t any &s;uch changes. A blood once provided with a due proportion of coagulable lymph is only liable to lo&s;e it by putrefaction, and it is of this that tho&s;e die who die for want of food. More to be attended to is what we mentioned la&s;t, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> when the dige&s;tive and a&s;&s;imilatory powers are too weak to convert aliment into proper juice. I am ready to believe this may happen; but in the formation of our blood, the effects of mo|tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;o little known, <HI>e. g.</HI> whether it would produce vi&s;cidity or fluidity, or whether there be not provi&s;ions to obviate the&s;e, that we cannot yet &s;peak po&s;itively on the &s;ubject. In one other way our fluid may be varied on the &s;ide of fluidity, by the more den&s;e parts being evacuated. Such effect might be &s;uppo&s;ed to take place in haemorrhage, but here it is uncertain whether the haemorrhage operates by ab&s;tracting the den&s;e parts, or by retaining the &s;ecretions, and &s;o occa&s;ioning fluidity.</P>
<P N="2">2. With regard to the production of fluidity by the dimini&s;hed force of cohe&s;ion in our fluids. This may happen from the fluids proceeding too far towards putrefaction, or from other cau&s;es, of an over proportion of &s;aline matter in the blood.</P>
<P>From whatever &s;ources this of fluidity may proceed, it will ap|pear they are very doubtful, and therefore that the exi&s;tence of it
<PB N="416" REF="014000_0422_0F9289F1F2A99AC0">
is not &s;o frequent. When it occurs, however, we mu&s;t next con&s;i|der how it is to be remedied. This may be affected in two ways; 1. by re&s;toring the due proportion of vi&s;cid fluids; 2. by encrea&s;ing their force of cohe&s;ion. The &s;ub&s;tances proper for the fir&s;t indica|tion are marked under the general title, to be mentioned afterwards. As to the &s;econd, the only medicines marked for this head are <HI>Acids</HI> and <HI>Alcohol.</HI> The&s;e can never be u&s;ed internally to produce their effect, and therefore are only employed externally in the ca&s;e of Haemorrhages.

<P>To the <HI>Nutrientia</HI> we mu&s;t add a number of Demulcents, which, as they contain a mucilaginous matter, may have the effect of en|crea&s;ing the vi&s;cidity of the ma&s;s; but then they float only in the &s;ero&s;ity, and are &s;oon carried off with it.</P>

<HEAD>DEMULCENTIA.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e are medicines which correct the acrimony of our fluids. Changes may be made in the mixture of our fluids when no Acri|mony takes place, but this is a &s;ubtilty not yet e&s;tabli&s;hed. Medi|cines correcting acrimony may be of two kinds, as correcting Acri|mony in general, or particular Acrimonies. It is the fir&s;t of the&s;e which is properly meant by Demulcents, which act not by chang|ing the nature of the acrimony, but merely by &s;heathing or covering it, in imitation of Nature, who has covered our &s;olids with a mucus for the &s;ame intention; for it is the &s;ame thing whether our &s;olids are wrapped up in this mucus, or whether the fluids are mixed with it. Hence all our Demulcents are mucilaginous, or oily matters, or a mixture of both. It is the &s;ero&s;ity which is the vehicle of acrimo|ny, in order that it may be carried off by the &s;ecretions. In the&s;e acrimony exerts its chief effects, and it is there, too, that our De|mulcents are collected, in order to defend the &s;ecretory organ. But before this I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that Demulcents which &s;heath
<PB N="417" REF="014000_0423_0F9289F2C67CFAF0">
acrimony, which in the heart-burn affects the upper orifice of the &s;tomach, have the &s;ame effect in the inte&s;tines, &s;upplying the natu|ral mucus, as in the ca&s;e of Dy&s;entery, and al&s;o defending the rec|tum in ca&s;e of very hard acrid faeces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the blood ve&s;&s;els, I do not imagine acrimony takes place, on account of the diffu&s;ion, and likewi&s;e becau&s;e the ve&s;&s;els are lubri|cated and defended from it by a mucus con&s;tantly ex&s;uding from their &s;ides. It is in the &s;ecretions, as we have &s;aid, where the acrimony pa&s;&s;es in greate&s;t plenty, and exerts mo&s;t of its effects. Hence in acrid urine, the efficacy of our Demulcents, which, carried along in the &s;ame &s;ero&s;ity with the acrimony, defends the kidneys from its effects; and hence in this, as well as other di&s;ea&s;es of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, calculous and nephritic ca&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;o very u&s;eful. An encrea&s;ed &s;ecretion of mucus is always acrid, being poured out from the follicles, before by &s;tagnation it has time to become mild. Thus poured out in the <HI>bronchiae,</HI> it produces an irritation, creates a vio|lent cough, and affects the lungs. Hence, in almo&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t our Demulcents are very effectual in covering the acrimo|ny of the mucus. Fluor albus is nothing more than an encrea&s;ed evacuation of mucus in an acrid &s;tate, and hence Demulcents be|come good palliatives. Nay, &s;ometimes the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to be con|tinued merely from the effects of the acrimony, and in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances I have &s;een Demulcents operate a perfect cure. Demul|cents are al&s;o u&s;eful in the flux of the lochiae in women.

only to be removed by Demulcents, externally or internally applied.

<HEAD>ANTACIDA.</HEAD>
<P>Animal bodies are formed, both fluids and &s;olids of them, from the aliment we take in. No portion of the&s;e fluids is of any dura|tion in the &s;y&s;tem, but is con&s;tantly wa&s;hing out, and &s;upplied from the aliment. Vegetable food is the only food of animals who&s;e changes we need properly enquire after, as all animals either live directly upon it, or on animals who do. The ace&s;cent matter of vegetables, for it is by that they are chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed from animal nature, is converted into animal matter in con&s;e|quence of powers &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the animal body. Hence, then, vegetable aliment in animal bodies goes through all the &s;teps to putrefaction, which, however, in its highe&s;t degree, never takes place in animal bodies. Hence we are led to con&s;ider animal fluids in three &s;tates; 1. a portion &s;till remaining ace&s;cent; 2. a portion in an intermediate &s;tate betwixt ace&s;cency and putrefaction, or the proper animal fluid; 3. a portion degenerated towards pu|trefaction. This view leads us to ob&s;erve the morbid deviations, while, on the one hand, our food retains too much ace&s;cency, or, on the other, is gone too far towards putrefaction. The&s;e two acrimonies, the acid and alkaline, are the chief, and perhaps the only ones we can di&s;tinctly mark. We may, indeed, perceive extraneous acrimonies introduced by different means into the body, but into the&s;e we cannot, nor is it our bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent to en|quire.
<PB N="421" REF="014000_0427_0F9289F5DA0AE690">
How far even in the common ma&s;s there may not be a variety of Acrimonies different from tho&s;e we &s;peak of, I &s;hall not &s;ay; but I maintain that no body has explained or &s;hewn of what kind they are, in what ca&s;es they appear, and with what &s;ymptoms they occur, or what &s;ymptoms they produce; and <HI>de non entibus, ac de non operantibus, fere eadem e&s;t ratio.</HI> There is yet a more fruitful &s;ource of acrimony in the body, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> from degenerated fluids being ab&s;orbed, and acting upon the &s;y&s;tem. But to know what acrimonies they would produce, we mu&s;t be acquainted with the &s;tate of all the &s;ecreted fluids, a knowledge we are very far from having attained. Every one of them which has been lately examined, has turned out different from what it was formerly imagined, and till once we are well acquainted with their nature, it is in vain to &s;peak of the changes to which they are liable; &s;o that, though we allow an infinite variety of acrimony, certainly we ought not to talk of them &s;o confidently as we do. As an apology for this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion I may ob&s;erve, that perfection is not to be expected in a &s;y&s;tem of the theory of Phy&s;ic, and that it is nece&s;&s;ary to point out its errors. I can venture at lea&s;t to &s;ay, that acrimony is often accu&s;ed without foundation. No &s;ooner do we &s;ee a motion excited in the &s;y&s;tem, than we refer it to &s;timulus, and that to acrimony; but every motion of the &s;y&s;tem can be ex|cited independent of the&s;e, as in the hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the pa&s;&s;ions of the mind. This, indeed, may be thought a &s;timulus, but &s;urely it is neither of the mechanical nor chemical kind. Acrimony, indeed, does exi&s;t, but its &s;pecies can never be preci&s;ely determined; nay, when it does exi&s;t, we may neglect it. Thus, undoubtedly, in the Small Pox, and other contagious di&s;ea&s;es, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> acrimony is certainly pre&s;ent; but in the cure it gives us no indication, and we do not regard the acrimony, but the effects it pro|duces. In the &s;ame manner, in the ca&s;e of poi&s;ons, we obviate their effects, for we very &s;eldom know the nature of the particular poi&s;on. Even when we do know them, it is very &s;eldom we can give medicines to correct them. However, there are a few ca&s;es where the indication is to expel the morbific matter; but then
<PB N="422" REF="014000_0428_0F9289F66A344A70">
this is only in a very general way, and by &s;uch medicines as bring a total change on the fluids. Upon the whole, then, you will &s;ee, with what impropriety we amu&s;e our&s;elves with acrimony, &s;eeing we accu&s;e it &s;o often without foundation, talk of it with &s;o little preci&s;ion, and may neglect it with &s;o much &s;afety. From all this we &s;hall treat only the acid and alkaline, as with the&s;e we are be&s;t acquainted.</P>
<P>Acid Acrimony takes place when the vegetable aliment retains its acid nature to a morbid degree. In what part of the &s;y&s;tem does this take place? In the fir&s;t &s;tage in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and almo&s;t only in the &s;tomach it&s;elf. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed it goes into the blood, and there occa&s;ions di&s;ea&s;es. For my part, I am of a contrary opinion. Even in the inte&s;tines an acid has never been found, for it is there covered with fluids. As &s;oon as it comes out of the &s;tomach it is mixed with the bile, and forms with it a compo&s;ition which is the cau&s;e of its effects in the inte&s;tines. Much le&s;s then can we &s;uppo&s;e it in the blood ve&s;&s;els. I doubt if even the chyle ever appears there, as &s;ome alledge, con&s;idering the diffu&s;ion it mu&s;t undergo immediately after pa&s;&s;ing from the thoracic duct into the &s;ubclavian vein. All the chyle &s;een in the&s;e days in the blood is only a portion of the coagulable lymph, &s;eparated by it&s;elf. Even although we allowed it did take place, in twelve hours it would di&s;appear; for after that time having elap&s;ed from the taking of food, no milk is &s;ecreted, &s;o that we cannot conceive it having any effect on the con&s;i&s;tence or mixture of our fluids. How far a certain modification in the &s;tate of our fluids may take place, I will not &s;ay. Vegetable aliment may, indeed, give a le&s;s den&s;e blood, but even that was doubted; but &s;uppo&s;ing it did, it would by no means be acid. Dr. Boerhaave is the chief leader of this doctrine, and, in his <HI>Aphori&s;ms,</HI> talks of an acid milk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> produced by it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The very &s;ame Boerhaave, in his Chemi&s;try, contradicts this opinion, and maintains the contrary again&s;t Lemery and Homberg. Nay, he goes to an exce&s;s on this &s;ubject, and denies an Acid could be extracted from human blood, an experiment &s;ucce&s;sfully re|peated
<PB N="423" REF="014000_0429_0F9289F9CEDE8C90">
&s;ince Homberg, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by every &s;ucceeding Chemi&s;t. When Van Swieten was publi&s;hed, I expected to have &s;een the matter confirmed; but if you look into his Commentary, you will find him talking &s;ceptically upon the &s;ubject, and giving no in&s;tances to confirm the allegations of Boerhaave. I &s;hall then ab&s;tract entirely from the con&s;ideration of Acid in the blood ve&s;&s;els, and talk of it only as exi&s;ting in the &s;tomach. There it many take place on two footings; 1. When the ace&s;cent fermentation is of the vinous kind, producing <HI>gas &s;ylve&s;tre,</HI> &s;pa&s;modic pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2. where, though the fermentation is calm, &s;uch a quantity of acid may be generated as to produce bad effect, uniting with the bile, and cau&s;ing Cholera, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e may depend on a variety of cau&s;es; 1. From an over proportion of ace&s;cent aliment, which may leave &s;o much Acid as to prove a ferment for &s;ome time after|wards. This cau&s;e is much con&s;idered, but of a nature ea&s;ily to be overcome. 2. The &s;ault more commonly lies in a defect of the dige&s;tive liquors, as an ab&s;traction of the &s;aliva, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 3. More frequently &s;till do the&s;e effects proceed from a weak &s;tomach; for by its natural action the aliment is compre&s;&s;ed, the air generated in the formation invi&s;cated and reab&s;orbed. Slow evacuation is another con&s;equence of a weak &s;tomach; and indeed this might have been made a di&s;tinct head, as Acidity is always greater in the proportion as the aliment is longer detained; and I have &s;een no in&s;tances of a very &s;trong Acid produced, except where there were &s;cirrho&s;ities of the pylorus, and then it had the effects of mineral acids, eroded linen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Not only is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low evacuation thus hurtful by cau&s;ing ace&s;cency, but al&s;o by preventing its pa&s;&s;age into the inte&s;tines, and being corrected by mixture with the inte&s;tinal fluids. From all this it appears, that vegetable aliment mu&s;t be more ace&s;cent, as le&s;s &s;oluble. The weaker action of the &s;tomach, de|&s;erves particular attention, as ari&s;ing from &s;o many &s;econdary cau&s;es, and the&s;e depending on the con&s;titution of the &s;y&s;tem, in general, the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es being &s;eldom a topical affection, and being produced even by pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and every encrea&s;ed evacuation of the &s;y&s;tem. In order, therefore, to a cure, we mu&s;t
<PB N="424" REF="014000_0430_0F9289FADAEDDC20">
eradicate the&s;e various cau&s;es; but our time forbids us now to enter upon &s;uch a con&s;ideration, and we are only to talk of &s;uch medicines as de&s;troy Acidity for the time pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The medicines &s;et down under the article <HI>Antacida,</HI> are tho&s;e which de&s;troy Acidity by neutralizing it. The&s;e are divided into three cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t contains Earths, the &s;econd Alkalines, the third Neutrals, under which is comprehended one compound of another kind.</P>

<P>All the &s;et marked at <HI>a,</HI> are <HI>Ab&s;orbents.</HI> They are divided into two fa&s;ciculi, the Fo&s;&s;ile and Animal.</P>
<P>Of the Fo&s;&s;ile I have &s;et down tho&s;e employed in our Di&s;pen&s;atory. <HI>Lapis calcarius</HI> may remain, though of no peculiar u&s;e. <HI>O&s;tiocolla</HI> &s;hould be rejected, as &s;trangers may &s;uppo&s;e we have &s;ome confi|dence in the virtues its name implies. <HI>Chalk,</HI> when wa&s;hed from its flint, is a pure Ab&s;orbent, perhaps the be&s;t of them, and preferable to the animal Ab&s;orbents. <HI>Magne&s;ia alba</HI> &s;hould have been added to this &s;et. It has had a con&s;iderable reputation as an Ab&s;orbent; and, when neutralized, as a Purgative; but I find it is not more ab&s;orbent than any of the re&s;t, nor more pur|gative in le&s;s quantity; as Chalk or Crabs eyes, given in the &s;ame do&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> two drachms will have the &s;ame effect. Therefore it may be neglected.</P>
<P>The Animal Ab&s;orbents are all of a common nature except the <HI>C. C. u&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">um,</HI> which ab&s;orbs le&s;s than any of the others, and for that rea&s;on has been propo&s;ed to be rejected; but its &s;alt is manife&s;tly of an a&s;tringent kind, and therefore it may very properly be retained, to be employed in &s;uch ca&s;es where we want an a&s;tringent joined with an ab&s;orbent power. I do not here &s;peak from experiment.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="014000_0431_0F9289FB0F60C098">
All the others are of common nature and virtues. They differ in &s;ome mea&s;ure in the quantity of acid they ab&s;orb, but this &s;o in|con&s;iderably, that cheapne&s;s may regulate our choice.</P>
<P>When the pre&s;ence of acid in the &s;tomach demands the u&s;e of ab&s;orbents, they may be u&s;ed with freedom, at lea&s;t we need not limit the do&s;e for fear of what &s;ome have imagined, that they &s;hall be entangled in the vi&s;cid matter and form hard cru&s;ts; for &s;o much does the &s;tomach tend towards acidity, that they would &s;oon be wa&s;hed out in a &s;aline &s;tate. We may not, however, go too far in ab&s;tracting acid, which &s;eems to take place for good purpo&s;e in the animal oeconomy, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to obviate the alkale&s;cency &s;o remarkable in the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem. If this be too much corrected, the putrid tendency will, in proportion, take place. Dr. Pringle has mentioned them, from their &s;eptic quality, as mi&s;chievous in dy&s;entery and pu|trid Fever. His rea&s;oning is tolerably well founded, but I do not apprehend the con&s;equence, for it is not a &s;mall quantity, nay, not even a large one, of ab&s;orbents, which will hurry on to putrefaction, &s;o much acid is continually generated, and we &s;ee every day per&s;ons of acid &s;tomachs take large and repeated do&s;es of them without producing that effect. Again, when they are joined to the acid in the &s;tomach, and neutralized, I conceive them acting like other neutrals as anti&s;eptic, and correcting any bad effects they produce by ab&s;traction of acid. In the inte&s;tines they are purgative, and partly with &s;ome degree of a&s;triction. At all times Ab&s;orbents have been noted as diuretic and diaphoretic, which properties, I believe, they exert in the &s;ame manner as neutral &s;alts. Carried into the blood, and pa&s;&s;ing by the excretories, they are in &s;ome mea&s;ure diuretic, and there are more e&s;pecially a&s;tringent. Liquid &s;hell, a combination of the muriatic acid with a calcarious earth, I have employed in nephritic ca&s;es with a manife&s;t alleviation of the &s;ymptoms. I &s;u&s;pected a &s;olvent power, but &s;ound none &s;uch out of the body, and therefore thought my &s;ucce&s;s imagination. But now that I find other medicines have the &s;ame property without affecting

the &s;tone, I make no doubt of its action, e&s;pecially as ab&s;orbent earths have had the &s;ame property a&s;cribed to them, and tho&s;e could never reach the kidneys without being joined to an acid in the &s;tomach.</P>

<P>Externally it di&s;covers &s;omewhat of an a&s;trictive quality, and &s;o is u&s;eful in lax and flaccid ulcers. Whether there it has any effect as an Anti&s;eptic, I cannot &s;ay. In the &s;tomach its chief effects are as and Ab&s;orbent and Solvent, correcting the too great vi&s;cidity of the mucus. I have &s;aid, that Arthritics and Nephritics are liable to di&s;orders of the &s;tomach. Lime-water relieves &s;uch di&s;orders. Some would alledge this to be in con&s;equence of a farther operation in the &s;y&s;tem, but to me its operation &s;eems to be in the &s;tomach, depending on its &s;olvent, ab&s;orbent, and a&s;trictive power.

<HEAD>FIXED ALKALIS.</HEAD>
<P>The fo&s;&s;ile and vegetable fixed Alkali have, as far as we know, the &s;ame effects in medicine; the fo&s;&s;ile is the milder.</P>
<P>Deprived of their air, or in their cau&s;tic &s;tate, they have the power of de&s;troying animal &s;ub&s;tances altogether; and hence are employed as the common e&s;charotic of the Surgeons. The &s;tronge&s;t Cau&s;tic is always the be&s;t, &s;oone&s;t performing what is intended, and I believe with lea&s;t pain. Prepared by it&s;elf, it is always fluid in the air, and it has been found u&s;eful to obtain it in a firm con&s;i&s;tent form. For this purpo&s;e, the preparation of the London College is preferable, and the Quick-lime there added, not only gives a dry form, but pre&s;erves the Alkali in its cau&s;tic &s;tate.</P>
<P>When not &s;o cau&s;tic, but more dilute, it is a fine &s;olvent and de|tergent in various foulne&s;&s;es of the &s;kin, freckles, morphew, where matter &s;ticks in the &s;ebaceous excretories.</P>
<P>It is extremely effectual in wa&s;hing off every thing that adheres to the body, and &s;o at fir&s;t gives a nitor and poli&s;h to the &s;kin; but upon frequent u&s;e, by wa&s;hing out the &s;ebaceous matter, it leaves it dry, &s;hrivelled, and parched.</P>
<P>Dr. Boerhaave employs it as a detergent in ulcers; but in ge|neral, except &s;uch as are very foul, and covered with cru&s;ts, ulcers do not bear &s;aline medicines at all, as they all produce inflammation. Hence the fixed Alkali has been thrown out of our tincture of myrrh,

and aloes, mixed with ointments it has been recommended for dre&s;&s;ing i&s;&s;ues by &s;ome. In the &s;tomach, fixed Alkali may be ab&s;orbent, but unle&s;s it meets with &s;ufficient quantity of acid, it will act as a &s;timu|lant, &s;o that in this intention it is a very uncertain medicine, very apt to be over do&s;ed, not exceeding in this property the ab&s;orbent earths, and not, like them, remaining innocent till an acid be produced to wa&s;h them away. Even as a &s;timulant I do not know but we have properly omitted the fixed Alkali, as in that intention more diffu&s;ible &s;timuli are preferably employed. It has, however, been mentioned as an u&s;eful &s;timulus to the inte&s;tines. Boerhaave talks of it as a con|venient purgative; but in this view, I imagine, with little advantage; for in &s;o far as not neutralized, it proves acrid and inflammatory, and when it is, excels not the neutral &s;alts, which are therefore, with ju&s;tice, more generally u&s;ed. Carried into the blood, and collected in the excretories, fixed Alkali proves diuretic; and perhaps there is none more powerful in that operation. It has been employed in vari|ous cachectic and e&s;pecially hydropic ca&s;es. Whether it acts by remaining alkaline, is doubtful. It is certainly proper to combine it with a little acid. In its cau&s;tic &s;tate the fixed Alkali is always mo&s;t powerful, but then it is too acrid. We &s;hould, however, take as near to Cau&s;ticity as we conveniently can; and I imagine Practi|tioners are right in u&s;ing the a&s;hes of plants; becau&s;e the Alkali of the&s;e is in a cau&s;tic &s;tate. It is commonly joined to an acid wine, by which it is half neutralized, and thus may be exhibited in greater quantity. The wine we commonly u&s;e is Rheni&s;h. Fixed Alkali may be a powerful &s;olvent of mucus, but Lime-water is &s;afer, and more effectual.</P>
<P>Huxam accu&s;es fixed Alkali as producing Scurvy, probably only from theory. It may act, however, by ab&s;orbing acid, and &s;o hur|rying putre&s;cency.</P>

BORAX has been &s;aid to be ab&s;orbent. It has been &s;aid to be diuretic, but I have never found it to have that property. In the &s;tomach it may be decompo&s;ed by the acid, there be ab&s;orbent, and act as other neutrals. It may be employed, where that is &s;afe, to take away <HI>Aphthae,</HI> which it does very well.</P>
<P>TARTARUS SOLUBILIS is the mo&s;t agreeable of the neutral &s;alts. The French have u&s;ed it, and recommended it. It is found that with the fo&s;&s;ile Alkali it will be got cry&s;tallized, and it is this which is called <HI>Sel de Seignette,</HI> from its inventor, and has been di&s;per&s;ed over France as a valuable remedy. But either in one or the other form it is a purgative, little to be depended upon, becau&s;e all the tartarous neutrals are liable to be decompo&s;ed by the acid in the &s;tomach; and becau&s;e in &s;oluble Tartar there is only a &s;mall portion of Alkali, and the re&s;t Cream of Tartar; and when the alkali of the &s;oluble tartar is taken away, the cream of tartar does not remain in a &s;ufficient do&s;e.

<P>SOAP, as an attenuant, has been already mentioned. I have &s;et it down here as decompo&s;ed in the &s;tomach, and I imagine its reputation twenty years ago, as of &s;o much u&s;e in arthritic ca&s;es, depends greatly upon that. Lime-water, too, may have &s;omewhat of the &s;ame action.</P>

<HEAD>ANTALKALINA.</HEAD>
<P>There is a doubt whether we can &s;peak of Acrimony as properly alkaline, and perhaps when this exi&s;ts, it is always with de&s;truction to the &s;y&s;tem. Du Haen, however, has &s;hewn us, that an Alkali may be developed in the &s;ecretories, as in the urine of calcalous pa|tients, who&s;e urine efferve&s;ced with acids, and turned &s;yrup of violets green. But in general, our fluids are only in an alkale&s;cent &s;tate, and it is to this our medicines mu&s;t be directed. This may occur in any part of the &s;y&s;tem, wherever there are animal fluids. It may even happen in the &s;tomach, though, on account of its ace&s;cent tendency, but &s;eldom. More copiou&s;ly it may exi&s;t in the inte&s;tines, mo&s;t of all in the common ma&s;s of blood, and the &s;everal excretories. In all the&s;e ca&s;es it may be con&s;idered as of two kinds, the chronic and acute; the former in Scurvies, the latter in putrid and malig|nant Fevers. With regard to the fir&s;t, the nature and cau&s;es are &s;ufficiently evident, it ari&s;ing, <HI>e. g.</HI> in con&s;equence of alkale&s;cent ali|ment taken in, or ob&s;truction of tho&s;e excretions by which alkale&s;|cent parts are thrown off. With regard to putrid Fevers, there is much darkne&s;s and ob&s;curity. In the ca&s;e of Scurvy, we can &s;up|po&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e to take place without a ferment; whereas in the latter ca&s;e that mu&s;t be taken in; and, indeed, a ferment of a pow|erful nature, and rapid progre&s;s. As to its manner of operation, it is doubtful whether it acts wholly on the fluids, or chiefly on the &s;olids. That it does act on the &s;olids often, is evident from the nervous affections accompanying it, and from the cure, we doing much more by Anti&s;pa&s;modics than Anti&s;eptics. I have no doubt of the action of contagion being on the nervous &s;y&s;tem, though at the &s;ame time I will not deny their action on the fluids. I have &s;een in&s;tances of it. A &s;ervant, in a family where I was employed, who lived very much upon vegetables, and was without any ob|&s;tructed &s;ecretions, on a &s;udden was &s;eized with a flaccidity of the gums, violent incoercible haemorrhage and <HI>pet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">hiae,</HI> and a putrid Fever, &s;oon ending with death. Here, certainly, the operation was on the fluids; and many in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind occur in the
<PB N="431" REF="014000_0437_0F928A004211B960">
annals of Phy&s;ic; but wherever this action on the fluids occurs, a cure is very little in our power. A chronic alkale&s;cency in the blood-ve&s;&s;els is only to be cured by throwing in a large quantity of vegetable ace&s;cents, and by opening the excretions, promoting per|&s;piration and urine. It is not to be cured by any &s;ub&s;tances not converted into our fluids, however powerful Anti&s;eptics, or effectual neutralizers of Alkali, becau&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary the vitiated fluids &s;hould be entirely &s;upplied with new ones. Practice confirms this; and I mention it to prove what I &s;o frequently inculcate, that medicines have little power of altering our fluids. As alkale&s;cency may occur in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> it is to be corrected by Acids. The&s;e are of two kinds, native and artificial. In treating their virtues, we &s;hall fir&s;t &s;peak of Acids in general, and then of particular Acids.</P>

<P>Applied to the lips, they &s;hew an a&s;tringent quality, as appears by vinegar expelling from them the red blood. This a&s;tringency is only proper to be taken notice of when they are con&s;iderably di|luted. Hence the vegetable Acid is commonly u&s;ed, and where this part of their operation is required; and hence they are u&s;ed to bathe over-&s;tretched ligaments. In a more concentrated &s;tate, to this a&s;tringent they join a &s;timulant and rubifacient power, and therefore we have thought of applying them in paralytic ca&s;es; for which purpo&s;e we blend them with oily matters, as hogs lard, in the <HI>Unguentum paralyticum,</HI> to obviate an exce&s;s of their inflamma|tory property. A more fluid Oil than the former may be employed, with the advantage, perhaps, of more accurate mixture. This ointment is certainly &s;erviceable, though not with great advantages. If the Acid be blended with too great proportion of oil, the &s;timulus is not con&s;iderable; if not, it is inflammatory, and does not extend over the &s;y&s;tem. It ought only to be employed where benefit is expected from a few applications of it; for on repeated u&s;e, in&s;tead of encrea&s;ing, you will ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ily &s;ee it mu&s;t impair and de&s;troy the &s;en|&s;ation

Applied alone in a concentrated &s;tate, Acids prove corro&s;ive, and de&s;troy the texture of animal &s;ub&s;tances. This corro&s;ive quality is not taken off by an union with metals, but encrea&s;ed by it. Thus, in the lunor cau&s;tic; &s;omewhat of its effects are to be attributed to the metal. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e with the Butter of Antimony, to which, as well as to the Acids, as cau&s;tics, may be objected the inconveniences of fluidity. How much Acid can perform alone, may be &s;een in the Medical E&s;&s;ays. It has there been propo&s;ed to make an alternate application of acid and cau&s;tic Alkali, giving the one, when the other had begun to pain; but in this method, each would hinder the other's operation, and a cru&s;t of neutral &s;alt would be formed, which would de&s;troy the effect of the Cau&s;tic. In &s;hort, the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eems to be a mere whim&s;y of refinement.</P>
<P>With regard to the internal u&s;e of Acids. In the mouth they exert <HI>a&s;tringent</HI> effects. To obtain this property, they have been exhibited in various forms. It was Sydenham's practice in the Angina to give the vitriolic Acid with <HI>Mel ro&s;arum.</HI> Where laxity prevails this may be u&s;eful, but it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;uch ca&s;es; and in more violent inflammation they are certainly hurtful and dangerous, by their &s;timulant, and, perhaps al&s;o, their a&s;tringent power. Acids al&s;o exert their <HI>&s;timulus</HI> in the mouth, and encrea&s;e the excretion of &s;aliva and mucus, and hence allay thir&s;t, in which intention they are &s;ometimes given in Drop&s;ies, where we want that effect without encrea&s;ing the quantity of fluids. It has been &s;aid, that they di&s;&s;olve the mucus, but this is not properly proved. On experiment, they do not coagulate it like blood, but &s;hew a tendency to that way, and their operation is proba|bly by &s;timulating the excretories, and drawing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orth a fluid, by which cru&s;ts and &s;loughs are pu&s;hed of. In any &s;ort of catarrhal

where a load of mucus is accumulated in the mouth of the glands or throat, they may be u&s;ed. Alum and Acids have been employed to cure <HI>Aphthae,</HI> but the practice is doubtful. They will, indeed, take away the <HI>Aphthae,</HI> but then they are very apt to return wor&s;e than before, except in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, which are difficult to di&s;tin|gui&s;h. Borax an&s;wers much better, e&s;pecially in children.</P>
<P>Carried into the &s;tomach, Acids prove a grateful &s;timulus to it, and promote appetite, which &s;hews they are not unfamiliar to the &s;y&s;tem. The acid <HI>reliquiae</HI> in the &s;tomach are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the cau&s;e of appetite, but this is more connected with the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem in general. Acids, by checking putrefaction, &s;erve to pre|&s;erve at lea&s;t, if not to excite, appetite; but not only do they obviate the putrefactive, but al&s;o check the vinous and acetous fermentati|ons; whence they are u&s;ed to prevent flatulencies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the con&s;e|quence of the&s;e. At fir&s;t I thought this difficult to account for, but I now &s;ee that it is not acid but ace&s;cency which is the di&s;ea&s;e; that vinegar, which has already undergone the acetous fermentation, is not near &s;o hurtful as vegetable ace&s;cents, and mineral acids &s;till le&s;s &s;o. Thus lemon, having its a&s;tringency improved by roa&s;ting, I have &s;een cure Spa&s;ms ari&s;ing from ace&s;cency; and thus the chlorotic girl eats the &s;our green fruit with &s;afety, while the ripe encrea&s;e her di&s;order, unripe fruit are much le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to ferment than the ripe; and hence the magi&s;trate in wine countries does not &s;uffer the grapes to be gathered till they are fully ripe, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the wine &s;hould not be well fermented. In the &s;tomach, too, Acids quench thir&s;t, by pro|moting a flow of liquors to it, by preventing putrefaction, and per|haps, too, as refrigerant. This property which Acids po&s;&s;e&s;s, of being cooling and &s;edative to the whole &s;y&s;tem, &s;eems contradictory to the &s;timulus we a&s;cribed to them; but as Acids in certain do&s;es and dilution are a&s;tringent, and as A&s;tringents are &s;edative, the effect is more ea&s;ily under&s;tood. Whether their action be not analogous to that of cold water, I &s;hall not determine. They may be diuretic and diaphoretic, by being carried to the &s;ecretory organs; but it is certain al&s;o, they exert this property before they arrive there.</P>
<P><PB N="434" REF="014000_0440_0F928A04F0E1FA20">
In the inte&s;tines. When Acids arrive there unaltered, they may be detergent by promoting the excretion of mucus. As checking putrefaction, as &s;edative, checking the peri&s;taltic motion, and al&s;o as a&s;tringent, Acids are u&s;eful in Dy&s;entery, but chiefly as altering the bile, to a change of which, Dy&s;entery &s;eems owing. It is the Acids in this di&s;ea&s;e which we prefer to the Ace&s;cents, perhaps from &s;edative powers analogous to neutrals. The fo&s;&s;ile Acids have not the &s;ame bad effect with the others, not proving much purgative. Their action in the inte&s;tines ought to be enquired into, as they precipitate the bile.</P>
<P>Whether in their progre&s;s through the lacteals they can act as acid, or in the ma&s;s of blood, is extremely doubtful, from the dilution they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily undergo before they reach the&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem. They might be &s;uppo&s;ed to cure, at lea&s;t to check the Scurvy, but neither the one nor the other is ob&s;erved, &s;o that their effects on the ma&s;s of blood are very doubtful. They have been recommended in Haemorrhagy. Here it is &s;uppo&s;ed they act on the open ve&s;&s;els, and by coagulating the fluids; but we cannot imagine them to be carried thither, and we mu&s;t rather &s;uppo&s;e they have their effect in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and not materially, but by con&s;ent on the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Though their effect on the blood be denied, yet it has been con&s;tantly allowed they may be collected in the excretories. Like other &s;aline matters they may go along with the &s;ero&s;ity, pa&s;s by the kidneys, and prove diuretic. On this foundation al&s;o they might be diaphoretic and &s;udorific, but from their manner of action the&s;e properties &s;eem to be in con&s;equence of their effects in the <HI>primae viae.</HI></P>

<P>We divided into native and artificial. The native Acids in ge|neral have the effects we mentioned of Acids, as exerted in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> but beyond that they &s;carcely act as acid; but by the action of the &s;y&s;tem are liable to be converted in <HI>&s;uccum et &s;an|guinem,</HI> and hence are adapted to the cure of the Scurvy, and it is there we frequently employ them. They differ as more or le&s;s mild or acerb.</P>
<P>Of the artificial Acids the fir&s;t mentioned is Wine, the Acid of which approaches to the la&s;t, as more or le&s;s convertible into the animal fluids. The others are more a-kin, and more invincible to the &s;y&s;tem, if we except the vegetable, which is divided into the fermented and di&s;tilled, which la&s;t is le&s;s convertible than the former. Such di&s;tilled Acid appears in Tar-water, who&s;e action &s;eems only to be in &s;o far as it is acid. It might, indeed, owe much of its virtue to the oil; but practice does not confirm this. Tar-water may be u&s;eful in promoting the whole fluid &s;ecretions, and in &s;ome ca&s;es anti&s;eptic; and if you look into what has been writ upon it, you will under&s;tand its real virtues from what has been already &s;aid.</P>
<P>The fo&s;&s;ile Acids are &s;tronger. Muriatic Acid has at all times been famous as promoting appetite, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting dige&s;tion. I have not given it pure, but joined with &s;ome alkali. This Hoffman tells us is the <HI>Tinctura aperitiva Moebii,</HI> only reddened by the addition of &s;ome ro&s;es.</P>
<P>Vitriolic Acid is employed for mo&s;t of the purpo&s;es of Acids ob|viating fermentation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uperior in haemorrhagic ca&s;es, but I cannot perceive this.

<P><PB N="436" REF="014000_0442_0F928A063ABCDD80">
The nitrous Acid is commonly excluded entirely, out of prejudice, for if equally dilute, it is as &s;afe as any of them. It is not, how|ever, totally di&s;u&s;ed. Boerhaave employed it in his <HI>Nitrum nitra|tum,</HI> which is a nitrous ammoniac, only with a &s;uperabundant quan|tity of acid.</P>
<P>Sedative Salt by Homberg was recommended as of extraordinary power, but in no in&s;tance has that been di&s;covered fairly. In one or two in&s;tances, I thought it had given relief in the Chincough, but I found afterwards its effects mu&s;t be attributed to other medi|cines joined with it. Any virtue it has, is that of being gently and weakly &s;edative, but even this is not well e&s;tabli&s;hed. The French now acknowledge all this.</P>
<P>Acid of Amber has been frequently u&s;ed in medicine, though it be not &s;o long &s;ince we di&s;covered it to be an Acid. It has failed me in every trial.

<HEAD>EVACUANTS in GENERAL.</HEAD>
<P>A doubt ari&s;es with regard to the propriety of placing the&s;e among the medicines which act upon the fluids. They act, proba|bly, on the &s;olids, but have the fluids for their object. With re|gard to their operation, there have been &s;everal opinions. 1. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed they act on the ma&s;s of blood, as, by rendering the blood of a fluid con&s;i&s;tence, they promote the fluid &s;ecretions;
<PB N="439" REF="014000_0445_0F928A08C34FC358">
but this operation extends &s;o much in common to all the &s;ecretions, as not to explain how particular ones are promoted; for it will &s;till be a doubt how we can give the fluidity proper to particular &s;ecre|tions. 2. To obviate this, it has been &s;aid, that all the &s;ecreted liquors exi&s;t formally in the ma&s;s of blood, and that the &s;ecretory organ only &s;eparates them; and with regard to the Evacuants, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed that they have an elective attraction to particular portions of our fluids. But all this is a mere &s;uppo&s;ition. There is no proof of the formal exi&s;tence of the&s;e matters, and of their not being altered in the &s;ecretory organ. Neither of the&s;e are &s;atis|factory, and hence we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to this third &s;uppo&s;ition, that Evacuants, particularly Stimulants, &s;timulate their re&s;pective excretories, as can be proved in the ca&s;e of Errhines and Siala|gogues. It is difficult to apply this to Evacuants diffu&s;ed in the ma&s;s of blood. We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e them &s;omehow determined to pa&s;s by particular excretories, in con&s;equence of being joined to particular parts of the blood more copiou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ing there, and thus &s;timu|lating tho&s;e very &s;en&s;ible and irritable organs. Still a que&s;tion re|mains, whether evacuants may not have a &s;pecific power in &s;timu|lating one excretory more than another? This is difficult to deter|mine. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that Evacuants are general Stimulants. Tho&s;e which affect the no&s;e, carried into the &s;tomach, will prove emetic; into the blood, diuretic, diaphoretic, and pectoral. The Stimulus is not in any that I know of certainly &s;pecific, and a com|mon power is evident in mo&s;t of them. This que&s;tion will be more fully mentioned under Particulars.</P>
<P>With regard to particular Evacuants, I have in&s;erted them at ran|dom. I have begun <HI>a capite ad calcem,</HI> and therefore the fir&s;t on which our enquiries will be be&s;towed, is the following head of Errhines.</P>

<HEAD>ERRHINA.</HEAD>
<P>Errhines are medicines applied to the inner membrane of the no&s;e, producing a di&s;charge of mucus, accompanied with a &s;timu|lus, and commonly &s;ternutatory. With regard to their effects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

cured by Evacuants, are more effectually cured by the&s;e being ap|plied near to the part affected. There are, indeed, ca&s;es where the evacuation mu&s;t be great, and &s;uch direct application cannot be made, and in &s;uch ca&s;es where we intend to alter the di&s;tribution of the fluids in the &s;y&s;tem; but the&s;e are the only exceptions. Upon this is the foundation of the virtue of Errhines. They are adapt|ed to di&s;ea&s;es of the head, acting partly by the &s;neezing, that ge|neral convul&s;ive motion they produce, and partly by evacuation. Since ob&s;ervations have been accurate, Errhines have not been much u&s;ed; and where they are u&s;eful, is difficult to determine. They are certainly proper in rheumatic affections about the head, in which evacuations of any kind are nece&s;&s;ary. I have known in|&s;tances of not only temporary relief procured from them in &s;uch ca&s;es, but even the rheumatic diathe&s;is being removed. I have known per&s;ons, unaccu&s;tomed to Tobacco, on the fir&s;t beginning to &s;nuff, relieved, and even cured of the tooth-ach, and other rheu|matic affections, to which they were &s;ubject. In all rheumatic head|achs, they are u&s;eful; and, analogous to the&s;e rheumatic affections, in all neighbouring inflammations of the chronic kind, as inflam|mations of the eyes frequently are. I &s;ee practitioners cautioning again&s;t Errhines, as producing conge&s;tions in the ve&s;&s;els of the head. If the di&s;ea&s;e be recent, certainly we ought not to u&s;e them; but when it has continued for &s;ome time, I have &s;een a cure from Errhines. Many di&s;ea&s;es are of this inflammatory nature, which we do not imagine to be &s;o, as the opacity of the Cornea, which is frequently founded in inflammation, though there be no &s;eeming redne&s;s, and al&s;o in a beginning cataract. In the&s;e, Errhines of the &s;tronge&s;t kind may be u&s;ed. At different times, Errhines have been employed in all di&s;ea&s;es of the head, though with what &s;afety or limitation I cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the general virtues of Errhines. The virtues of par|ticular ones cannot well be fixed. I believe our li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> might have been more general, as there is no &s;u&s;picion of a &s;pecific virtue.

Among the <HI>Acriora,</HI> Euphorbium &s;hould have been placed lower. Among the Errhines none is more famous than <HI>Turpeth mineral.</HI> In di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes it has been much commended in general; but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this and other Acrids are not only apt to produce violent inflammation and dangerous Haemorrhage in the membrane of the no&s;e it&s;elf, but al&s;o in the neighbouring parts. I have &s;een a few drops of the <HI>Iris no&s;tras,</HI> or <HI>Iris palu&s;tris lutea,</HI> occa&s;ion a vio|lent &s;neezing and di&s;charge of mucus with blood, &s;welling of the whole head and neck, and, perhaps from &s;ome neglect of the patient in keeping him&s;elf warm, indurations of the cheeks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> only yielding to repeated bleedings, but curing, however, the patient of the tooth-ach, and di&s;ea&s;e for which it was applied. Even where it was given in a &s;lighter do&s;e, often a great rheumatic affection was caught during the u&s;e of it. I mention all this, to give a caution that cold got during the u&s;e of the&s;e remedies is often wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e they were intended to cure.</P>
<P>The only two I have known employed with &s;afety and advantage, are Tobacco and A&s;arum. The fir&s;t is only u&s;eful when we begin the practice. A&s;arum is recommended as keeping up a longer flow of mucus than any other. Tho&s;e who favour it, &s;ay it is nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould produce a mucus with &s;treaks of blood.

<HEAD><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following account of Mercury is added from the Author's works on Chemi&s;try, and though not &s;o complete as might be wi&s;hed, may &s;erve to explain the &s;ubject more fully.</P>
<P>This is a &s;ubject that has been of all the mo&s;t laboured in Chemi&s;try, and mo&s;t frequently employed in Medicine.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here endeavour to &s;hew its variety of preparations, and e&s;tabli&s;h their relation in regard to each.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t que&s;tion that ari&s;es is, Whether Mercury is active in its crude &s;tate, as is not (in that) acted on by the vegetable acid? This, however, is &s;omewhat doubted; but &s;ome &s;peak much of its efficacy, and Dover gave it in a variety of di&s;ea&s;es; and when this is the ca&s;e, a medicine will frequently reap that honour which is only due to nature. It certainly may be converted into an active &s;tate, by a &s;mall degree of trituration. Nay, even the agitation of the &s;teadie&s;t buildings, when &s;tanding in a phial, will induce a black powder on its &s;urface, and, probably, the agitation in the &s;tomach may an&s;wer the &s;ame intention.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is rendered active by being turned into vapour, and is then indued with a &s;edative power, and can induce pal&s;ies of various kinds; hence Gilders are particularly &s;ubject to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Vide</HI> De <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n. When u&s;ed in venereal ca&s;es, it brings on a &s;alivation. Why &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> two ca&s;es be &s;o different? But this action, in a &s;tate of fume, is not peculiar to Mercury <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> common to other metals in &s;ome degree; but its operation can never be conducted with accuracy.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is rendered active when calcined, whether by it&s;elf, or with gold. It is by this means, probably, only more capable of being acted on by the vegetable acid, and con&s;e|quently by the acid in the &s;tomach.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is peculiar to Mercury to be rendered active by trituration. It can be thus con|verted into a black powder, manife&s;tly active to the human body. This trituration goes on &s;lowly in gla&s;s ve&s;&s;els when <HI>per &s;e,</HI> but may be expeded by the addition of rough bodies, or even of fluids; and when a &s;mall portion is thus converted into a black powder, it gives the whole that appearance; however, upon wa&s;hing it, it will ea&s;ily &s;eparate from the crude.</P>
<P>Key&s;er, a celebrated empiric in France, has found a way of converting it into this &s;tate more effectually, by triturating it with water, which wa&s;hes out the powder as it forms, and hence ari&s;es its peculiar efficacy. In this &s;tate it is &s;oluble in the vegetable acid, for which rea&s;on he adds a quantity of that acid, which a&s;&s;i&s;ts in &s;eparating the pure powder.</P>
<P>Other &s;ub&s;tances have been u&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the trituration. Honey is much preferable to either the bal&s;ams, or gums, of which la&s;t I have &s;een pills made of &s;o &s;tiff a con&s;i&s;tence, as to pa&s;s through the body undi&s;&s;olved, and unaltered.</P>
<P>This objection is applicable to gum ammoniac likewi&s;e, unle&s;s at the &s;ame time an equal quantity of &s;oap is added, which gives it con&s;i&s;tence and &s;olubility.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o given it with re&s;in of guiacum, but this is &s;till wor&s;e than the foregoing, as being more difficultly triturated, and le&s;s &s;oluble.</P>
<P>In making the trituration we are very apt to be deceived, by thinking it &s;ufficient when no globules appear to the micro&s;cope, for after an intermi&s;&s;ion of the triture, globules will appear that did not before; we &s;hould return to it at intervals, and continue it till it is almo&s;t &s;oluble in water.</P>
<P>From this difference of triture, very different effects will ari&s;e in the &s;ame medi|cine. I have thus &s;een &s;even grains produce the &s;ame effect with three drachms of a wor&s;e prepared medicine. Oils of any kind likewi&s;e, as &s;uet, &amp;c. may be joined, when we u&s;e it externally. Some of the Bal&s;ams would extingui&s;h it better, as Bal&s;. Terebinth Liquid Storax, or Bal&s;. of Sulphur, but their ero&s;ion of the &s;kin renders them u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Here the &s;ame cautions are nece&s;&s;ary, with regard to triture, and the efficacy of the oint|ment will be proportionable.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e triturated with te&s;taceous and dry powders, and thus forms the <HI>Merc. alcalizatus.</HI> It is thus rendered capable of being active, but as its action depends on the acid of the &s;tomach, and as the te&s;taceous powders would de&s;troy that acidity, its power of acting would be thus de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Sugar an&s;wers better, e&s;pecially if we add a drop or two of e&s;&s;ential oil to a&s;&s;i&s;t its divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Triturated with &s;ulphur it becomes an inert &s;ub&s;tance, as being capable of re&s;i&s;ting the vegetable acid.</P>
<P>This I could determine <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> whether it was in the form of AEthiops Mineral, or native, or factitious Cinnabar. Some &s;ay the&s;e are active, but I never could find them to have any effect. I have &s;een the AEthiops Mineral given in as large quantities as the &s;tomach could bear, when the Sulphur only exerted its laxative effects.</P>
<P>Mercury may be united with Sulphur in three ways; fir&s;t, by trituration; &s;econdly, by fu&s;ion; thirdly, by &s;ublimation; of which the la&s;t is the wor&s;t, becau&s;e the clo&s;er the con|nection the le&s;s active.</P>
<P N="5">5. We are now come to its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tate. There are &s;ome of its combinations with &s;aline &s;ub&s;tances that are not &s;oluble in water. This, perhaps may be thought an objection to the term, but we &s;hall wave this, and call every combination with acid &s;aline. Here the alkalies are entirely out of the que&s;tion, as it entirely rejects any union with them, and as the lea&s;t of their pre&s;ence entirely de&s;troys the gilding proce&s;s; the &s;ame, too, with regard to neutrals.</P>
<P>Its union with the Fo&s;&s;il Acids has always been known, and to the&s;e I have added the Vegetable. I &s;hall &s;peak of it as combined with the&s;e in its crude, calcined, or triturated &s;tate.</P>
<P>The calcination and trituration of Mercury is a curious problem, and what other metals are not &s;ubject to.</P>
<P>In trituration, Are the particles that con&s;tituted its crude nature &s;eparated? Or does it admit of any addition under it? I &s;hould be rather of the latter opinion; but what this addition is, whether of &s;ome matter univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, I know not. We may next con&s;ider it, as it is diver&s;ified by the acids.</P>
<P>Turpeth Mineral may be made in two ways; fir&s;t, by adding the Mercury to the Vitriolic Acid, when at the boiling heat, and thus obtaining a matter that has the appear|ance of a white calx, which, on being wa&s;hed in pure water, is converted into a yellow powder.</P>
<P>This change of colour is a curious problem. Secondly, it may be made by di&s;&s;olving the Mercury in the Nitrous Acid, and then adding the Vitriolic, and then by wa&s;hing it we get the Turpeth.</P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t ea&s;y proce&s;s, but it is the mo&s;t acrid preparation, becau&s;e there is a quantity of the Acid adhering, but by repeated affu&s;ions, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heat, it may be made nearly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Mercury is next combined with the Nitrous Acid. The&s;e preparations have been but little employed in medicine, and have rather been u&s;ed as the foundations of others.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e combined with the Muriatic Acid, and this either by precipitation or cal|cination, and accordingly forms either the Mercurius &s;ublimatus corro&s;ivus, or the Mercurius precipitatus albus of Boerhaave.</P>
<P>The Marine Acid does not unite with it in a fluid form, and mu&s;t therefore be u&s;ed either as combined with metals, or with neutral &s;alts; for this purpo&s;e common &s;alt is added to Mercury di&s;&s;olved in the Nitrous Acid.</P>
<P>A certain rule to judge of its acrimony, is from its &s;olubility in water, for the greater quantity the water will take up, the more &s;alt adheres to it, and con&s;equently the more acrid is the preparation.</P>
<P>The method of precipitation from the men&s;truum, when it is in the form of a Calx Mercurii, is much ea&s;ier; but there is an objection, that the Acid is in too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> quantity, and the preparation is not ea&s;ily brought into a cry&s;talline form. We have &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d a way, however, of managing this, by &s;u&s;pending it in <HI>Nitrous Ammoniac,</HI> and then adding common &s;alt. All the other preparations of Mercury depend on their being rendered more mild, or more acrid.</P>
<P>They are rendered milder, fir&s;t, by the ab&s;traction of the Acid; or, &s;econdly, by the addition of Mercury.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the ab&s;traction of the Acid. Some have doubted if Mercury is rendered more powerful, by being added to Acids; but I think none who are conver&s;ant in practice can deny it. The degree of trituration certainly varies its efficacy, but one-eighth of a grain of corro&s;ive Mercury is a do&s;e.</P>
<P>One method of ab&s;tracting the Acid is by calcination, as in the Red Precipitate. The foreign Precipitates are thought to be better than tho&s;e made at home. The London College has, therefore, given particular directions, nay, more than nece&s;&s;ary, as I think; for the whole difference between the foreign and dome&s;tic &s;eems to depend on the degree of calcination, which is &s;ometimes carried too far, &s;o as to &s;ublime too much of the Acid.</P>
<P>Another method is by attraction of the Acid. This is of two kinds, fir&s;t, when the acid is attracted only; and, &s;econdly, where the Mercury is precipitated. An in&s;tance of the fir&s;t is the <HI>Pulvis Principis. Vide</HI> Lewis. The water here di&s;&s;olves that part which has the large&s;t proportion of acid, and leaves the le&s;s &s;oluble, and con&s;equently le&s;s acrid behind. Water applied to any of the &s;aline Calces will thus ab&s;tract the more active part.</P>
<P>Ardent Spirit, in many in&s;tances, ab&s;tracts the Acid from metallic &s;ub&s;tances pretty entirely. I think I have &s;een Corro&s;ive Sublimate rendered inactive by this means. It may likewi&s;e, when dilute, act like the water, in ab&s;tracting the mo&s;t acrid part. This is the foundation of the <HI>Mercurius Corallinus</HI> and <HI>Panacea Mercurii.</HI></P>
<P>Camphor unites with Acids in the large&s;t quantity of any other &s;ub&s;tance. It triturates ea&s;ily with, and has been added to the Turpeth Mineral, (<HI>Vide Edin. Med. E&s;&s;ays;</HI>) and I have often u&s;ed it with &s;ucce&s;s before our late improvements.</P>
<P>Mercury is rendered milder by attraction and precipitation. The <HI>Mercur. precip. Fu&s;cus Wortzii</HI> is Mercury di&s;&s;olved in the Nitrous Acid, and precipitated by a fixed alkaline Salt; this gave a mild preparation, but its un&s;eemly colour was the chief objection. To obviate this the Muriatic Acid was u&s;ed, which gives us the <HI>Merc. precipitatus dulces</HI> of the former Edinburgh Di&s;pen&s;atory; but it has been but little u&s;ed in our &s;hops, though it might be an u&s;eful medicine, and an&s;wer pretty nigh the &s;ame intentions with Calomel.</P>
<P>The Muriatic Acid has been u&s;ed in conjunction with Copper, &s;o that the Mer|cury was precipitated in a green powder. Different accounts have been given of this, &s;ome approving, others di&s;approving of it; but it &s;eems to act uncertainly, and with violence. I &s;hould think that from this combination of copper we might receive ad|vantages in external applications.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mercur. precipit. albus</HI> of the London Di&s;pen&s;atory is made both with fixed and volatile Alkali; the colour depends on the proportion of the volatile Alkali.</P>
<P>Another way by which mercurial preparations are rendered milder, is by a fre&s;h quantity of Mercury. This is effected in the proce&s;s for Calomel, where a fre&s;h quantity of Mercury is added to a portion of Corro&s;ive Sublimate. The union of the&s;e is fir&s;t made by trituration, and it then is more intimately effected by repeated &s;ublimations.</P>
<P>Sublimation to the &s;econd or third time may produce the intention, but to carry it farther will only &s;eparate the Mercury.</P>
<P>The only true &s;tandard of a &s;ufficient &s;ublimation is to examine its &s;pecific gravity in ardent &s;pirits, and &s;o determine their comparative mildne&s;s. Two &s;ublimations, after a &s;ufficient previous triture, generally are &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>The metal may have the acid adhering to it in any proportion, but the acid &s;eems to have a point of &s;aturation with regard to the metal, and when this proportion is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> water nor alcohol will have any effect on it. But thus endeavouring to render the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mild, we bring it to a Mercurius dulcis, and this equally well, either by ab&s;tracting the Acid, or by adding Mercury.</P>
<P>MERCURIAL PREPARATIONS <HI>rendered acrid, or kept &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are rendered more acrid by redi&s;&s;olving the Precipitates. When Mercury is precipitated from any of the fo&s;&s;il acids by alkalis, it is &s;oluble in the vegetable acid. I have precipitated Mercury from the nitrous acid, by means of fixed alkalies, and again di&s;&s;olved it in the muriatic, and from thence obtained it in cry&s;tals. This is a pretty accurate preparation; one grain of this I di&s;&s;olved in an ounce of water, and gave twenty drops of it for a do&s;e, &s;o that &s;uppo&s;ing this grain contained one third of Mercury, which &s;eems to be the ca&s;e, this one third di&s;&s;olved in an ounce of water, or four hundred and eighty drops, the&s;e twenty drops could only contain 20-480 of 1-3 of a grain of Mercury. This &s;hews the great addition of power that Mercury acquires by being joined to Acids. This is the <HI>Mercurius &s;olutus,</HI> as I have called it.</P>
<P><HI>By Su&s;pen&s;ion with</HI> SAL AMMONIAC.</P>
<P>I u&s;ed formerly to &s;ay, that the combination with the muriatic Acid was more cor|ro&s;ive than that with the nitrous or vitriolic, but I have found the nitrous equal to either of the others; but when di&s;&s;olved in water or alcohol, a portion of the acid is ab&s;tracted, &s;o that the Mercury falls to the bottom in form of a powder; hence aro&s;e the difference of its efficacy, and the dangerous in accuracy attending it; for whether di&s;&s;olved in water or brandy, the &s;trength of the &s;olution will be widely different at different times, and every day fre&s;h Mercury will be &s;ub&s;iding. For the&s;e rea&s;ons it was that I fir&s;t thought of the preparation ju&s;t mentioned. Sal Ammoniac renders the Metallic Salt more capable of being taken in greater proportions, as it increa&s;es the &s;u&s;pen&s;ibility of water to twenty times its natural power. The Sal Ammoniac not only enables us to give it in a &s;maller do&s;e, but by continually &s;u&s;pending the Mercury it renders that do&s;e always accurate. All the&s;e preparations differ only in being mild or acrid.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Action of</HI> MERCURY.</P>
<P>I imagine that Mercury acts only as a &s;timulus on the &s;en&s;ible and irritable parts of the &s;olids. It has been long thought to have acted on the fluids by di&s;&s;olving them; but &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould do &s;o, there are undoubted proofs, too, of its acting on the &s;olids. Thus it acts as an emetic and purgative, as a &s;timulant to the whole va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, as a diaphoretic and diuretic. Had it acted on the fluids only, every &s;ecretion would have been increa&s;ed equal with the &s;alivary. It never produces any effects on the &s;ecretions, till it has arrived in form and &s;ub&s;tance at the &s;ecretories. Thus we &s;ee it produces a &s;light inflammation, and increa&s;ed di&s;charge at the &s;alivary glands.</P>
<P>In the height of a &s;alivation, where the inflammation runs &s;o high as to render bleeding nece&s;&s;ary, an inflammatory cru&s;t was found upon the blood, a circum&s;tance very incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>We &s;hall, however, advance, on the other hand, the mo&s;t favourable fact, in &s;upport of its acting on the fluids. It is found greatly to aggravate the &s;curvy, where the blood is found to be alkale&s;cent, and di&s;po&s;ed to fluidity; and that the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of a &s;curvy are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of an incipient &s;alivation, <HI>i. e.</HI> a putrid laxity of the gums, tendency to bleed on the &s;lighte&s;t injuries, and a fetid breath. So far I allow. But I imagine it has only the&s;e effects when accumulated in large quantities in the &s;alivary glands, and that it does not produce the &s;ame effects in other parts of the body. By this particular accumula|tion in the &s;alivary glands, it &s;timulates them, and cau&s;es a greater flow through their organs, but does not, by inducing a di&s;&s;olution, occa&s;ion the blood to di&s;charge it&s;elf by this outlet. The acrid preparation &s;timulate the &s;tomach, and, in con&s;equence of that, perhaps the whole &s;y&s;tem by con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The mild preparations never an&s;wer but when they run off by the &s;aliva. This accounts for the &s;uppo&s;ition, that &s;alivation was the only true application of it. If Mercury had acted on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> poi&s;on as an antidote, it might have been expected to have performed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> without any &s;en&s;ible evacuations. Salivation was thought to be the only way of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it, but we now know that it may be done by other ways, and with le&s;s trouble. We have in&s;tances of its being cured by the inte&s;tinal di&s;charge; but this is tedious and doubtful. The cure by urine or &s;weat mu&s;t chiefly be promoted by the more acrid preparation. But in &s;ome people all mercurial prepa|rations have a particular tendency to the mouth; here we mu&s;t yield to the natural tenden|cy, and &s;uffer the &s;alivation to go on; but when it can be done otherwi&s;e, it is with le&s;s trou|ble to the patient, and le&s;s care and attention to the practitioner.</P>
<P>N. B. There is one preparation of Mercury which I forgot to in&s;ert, <ABBR>viz</ABBR>. a third way of uniting it with the muriatic acid. Sal Ammoniac is triturated with Mercury till the glo|bules di&s;appear; this is put into a moi&s;t place, where it &s;uffers a delique&s;cence, &s;ome of the Mercury re-a&s;&s;umes its fluid form, the delique&s;cent part is to be poured off, and the re&s;t tri|turated with the liquefied Mercury, till the whole is di&s;&s;olved. This operation is founded on the &s;tronger attraction Mercury has to the muriatic Acid than the volatile Alkali has.</P></NOTE> MERCURY.</HEAD>
<P>Upon this head we &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider the operation of Mercury in general; and here the fir&s;t que&s;tion that occurs, is, whether it operates on the fluids or &s;olids; as di&s;&s;olving the former, or as a &s;timulant to the latter, exciting the re&s;pective &s;ecretions of tho&s;e to which it is applied?</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="014000_0449_0F928A0C2C3C7680">
The fir&s;t is the common &s;uppo&s;ition. That opinion, in the fir&s;t place, has been &s;upported by arguments <HI>&agrave; priori.</HI> 1. It has been &s;aid, that it acts from its &s;pecific gravity, its great momentum in the ma&s;s of blood breaking down its texture. But to me this
<PB N="444" REF="014000_0450_0F928A0E466B5750">
is not at all &s;atisfying; for, fir&s;t, it is proved by Chemi&s;try, that mechanical force never divides Mixts, but only Aggre|gates. Our ve&s;&s;els, indeed, who&s;e action may be &s;uppo&s;ed me|chanical, &s;eem to have &s;ome &s;uch power; but then this is from
<PB N="445" REF="014000_0451_0F928A0E765B3110">
breaking the cohe&s;ion, but not altering the mixture. 2. Suppo&s;ing &s;uch effect could take place from mere mechanical force, that here is not &s;ufficient; for any body reduced to &s;o great tenuity as to &s;wim in a fluid, will have in proportion to its greater tenuity, the ratio of its

&s;uperficies to the quantity of matter &s;o increa&s;ed; as not to be able to overcome the re&s;i&s;tance. Thus the mo&s;t ponderous gold can be &s;o mi|nutely divided as not to be able to overcome the cohe&s;ion of water or &s;pirit of wine, but to be &s;u&s;pended in them; &s;o that much le&s;s can
<PB N="447" REF="014000_0453_0F928A0FF26CB100">
Mercury be &s;uppo&s;ed to alter the cohe&s;ion of our blood. 3. Sup|po&s;ing the force of Mercury capable to break down our blood, the quantity, even the greate&s;t we can &s;uppo&s;e to be introduced, will not have the effect, &s;o that every thing &s;aid on the mechanical action of Mercury on the Fluids is without foundation.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="014000_0454_0F928A10AF641C50">
Secondly. Tho&s;e who alledge that Mercury acts on the Fluids, alledge it acts by a &s;eptic power. The proofs brought are, the remarkable faetor of the &s;aliva, the tumid flaccid gums, and the blood ready to flow out from them. The&s;e arguments &s;eem very &s;pecious. Again, &s;ay they, experience &s;hews that Mercury is hurtful in the Scurvy. With re&s;pect to its effects in the Scurvy, that may depend on its irritation and &s;timulus, and all other &s;timu|lants have the &s;ame effect in aggravating Scurvy. As to the faetor of
<PB N="449" REF="014000_0455_0F928A1174AB3EF0">
the &s;aliva, po&s;&s;ibly it may have the power of producing that, but not of extending putrefaction over the &s;y&s;tem. But the foetor can be pro|duced without Mercury, and there is no in&s;tance of an encrea&s;ed &s;e|cretion being kept up for any length of time, without the &s;ame &s;ymp|toms occurring. This accounts for the other effects in the mouth, which ari&s;e evidently from the putrid &s;aliva; for no one in&s;tance is alledged of a &s;corbutic putrefactive taint taking place in any other part of the &s;y&s;tem. There is no alteration in the blood during a &s;a|livation, and its vi&s;cidity appears then as &s;trong as at any other time. Salivation is attended with an inflammation, and the blood &s;hews an inflammatory cru&s;t, which, indeed, may be &s;aid to be a &s;ymptom of the Scurvy; but then, if we examine it, we find it den&s;er than it ap|pears in that di&s;ea&s;e. Again, after the operation of Mercury is over, no taint appears in the blood, but, on the contrary, the per|&s;on is in better health than before, and gives marks of a firmer &s;tate of it.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, I would conclude, though not certainly, that Mercury acts neither by its mechanic nor &s;eptic powers. We have proved at lea&s;t that it is not &s;eptic in the ma&s;s of blood; but if it be &s;o, only as collected in the &s;ecretories. But though we &s;hould allow Mercury in a con&s;iderable quantity to have &s;omewhat of a &s;eptic power, yet in the ordinary do&s;e in which we exhibit it, it can never have that effect. In the ca&s;e of unction, that indeed may be
<PB N="450" REF="014000_0456_0F928A122F941D60">
denied; but we have many in&s;tances of a very &s;mall quantity of &s;ome preparations of it taken internally having the &s;ame effect as &s;ome ounces by unction.</P>
<P>All this will be farther confirmed by the arguments we can bring for the action of Mercury being as a &s;timulant. All its effects may be explained from this &s;uppo&s;ition. From its &s;timulus in the &s;tomach it proves emetic; and carried into the inte&s;tines, it is pur|gative from the &s;ame quality; into the blood, diuretic and diaphore|tic; and, in &s;hort, like other evacuants, a very general &s;timulus. Other arguments for its action as a &s;timulant are, that it never acts but in an acrid condition, di&s;coverable by its metallic cupreous &s;tate in the mouth; that a &s;alivation can be excited by its external application to the &s;alivary glands; that its effects are always accompanied with &s;ome degree of fever and inflammation; that its effects in ulcers are plainly derived from its &s;timulant powers producing that degree of inflam|mation nece&s;&s;ary to the being of good pus, and that it produces the&s;e effects much better by external application than internal exhibition. In proportion as the&s;e proofs of the &s;timulant power of Mercury are convincing, they weaken all others that may be alledged for any other method of action.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning is &s;omewhat connected with another que&s;tion, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Why Mercury is more particularly and naturally determined to go by the &s;alivary glands? The fact is certainly true, and more &s;o of this than of any other acrid acting by a common &s;timulus. Tho&s;e who talk of its mechanical power &s;ay, that the more ponderous parts of the blood keeping the axis of the canal, and the cour&s;e of the blood, from the left ventricle to the head, being more in a &s;trait line than in the de&s;cending aorta, that therefore the more ponderous and &s;olids parts will be determined thither. I would alledge that this hypothe&s;is is not &s;upported by Anatomy; for the aorta &s;uffers a curvature before it gives off the carotids, &s;o that the heavier mole|culae mu&s;t be reflected into this curvature, and con&s;equently the
<PB N="451" REF="014000_0457_0F928A1357AB8648">
rea&s;oning mu&s;t be groundle&s;s which is built on the contrary &s;uppo|&s;ition. Another &s;uppo&s;ition is, that Mercury breaks down the blood to the &s;ize which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">its it for pa&s;&s;ing off by the &s;alivary glands; but this is very difficult to &s;uppo&s;e, and entirely hypothetical: Much rather may we &s;ay, that Mercury goes chiefly to the glands, from a certain attraction to the liquor of the &s;alivary glands, in the &s;ame manner as neutrals, by an alliance to the watery parts of the blood, are concentrated in the kidneys. The nature of the &s;aliva and of ma|ny other of the &s;ecreted fluids is not known. I would alledge For|dyce's experiments, that it comes nearer to the mucus than has been imagined. This uncertainty with regard to the &s;aliva, prevents my endeavouring to go farther to give the rea&s;on why Mercury is particularly related to that liquor. Upon the whole, Mercury ap|pears a very univer&s;al Stimulant, and general Evacuant, being emetic, cathartic, diaphoretic, diuretic, and &s;alivatory, and accord|ingly we find it one of the mo&s;t univer&s;al aperients and deob&s;truents with which we are yet acquainted.</P>
<P>Thus much we have thought proper to &s;ay with regard to the general operation of Mercury. We &s;hall now proceed to talk of the preparations of Mercury, as in the&s;e the effects are diver&s;ified.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>PREPARATIONS of MERCURY.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the u&s;e of the preparations in practice, Crude Mercury, and the combination in <HI>Cinnabar</HI> and <HI>AEthiops mineralis,</HI> to which may be added the <HI>AEthiops antimonialis,</HI> in &s;o far as it contains Mercury, can only by accident, or indirectly, prove medicines. All the others are not only active but powerful; the only di&s;tinction, however, &s;eeming to be, that of being more or le&s;s acrid. How to determine their difference in that re&s;pect is not ea&s;y. It is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed that Mercury, triturated with Turpentine and Honey, is one of the milde&s;t preparations, and that every addition, as well that by acid, as the fire, gives additional acrimony. The prepartions by triture are very apt to be imperfect, and I maintain they are more
<PB N="452" REF="014000_0458_0F928A13E74E2628">
active, as longer triture is be&s;towed. Hence I &s;hould imagine, that if Mercury in this way were properly divided, the preparation might prove equally acrid with the precipitate <HI>per &s;e.</HI> As prepared in the &s;hops, the &s;trength of this medicine is very imperfect, and uncertain. Generally no other te&s;t is &s;ought of the preparation's accuracy, but the blackne&s;s and di&s;appearance of the particles. Although they di&s;appear at pre&s;ent, upon &s;tanding they very fre|quently are collected, and re-a&s;&s;ume their form, and therefore, after having obtained the foregoing te&s;ts, we &s;hould let the ointment &s;tand for a day, and u&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a gla&s;s, to &s;ee if any collected globules can be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Mercury united with the Vegetable Acid, as in Key&s;er's <HI>Drageae,</HI> &s;hould be one of the milde&s;t preparations. The preparations of Mercury with the nitrous Acid are milder than tho&s;e with the vitriolic, and the&s;e again le&s;s acrid than the muriatic preparations.</P>
<P>All the&s;e differ in their operation as that is exten&s;ive or partial. Taken into the &s;tomach, they &s;hew their effects by producing &s;ick|ne&s;s and pain, and &s;ometimes go the length of vomiting. This leaves &s;ome doubt of the &s;pecific &s;timulus of Mercury, which, in oppo&s;ition to Antimony, will often &s;ooner inflame the &s;tomach than prove emetic. Whenever Mercury is to be u&s;ed in that inten|tion, it mu&s;t be given in a large do&s;e. I do not know whether it is by accident, or de&s;ign, that Turbith Mineral has been here commonly employed. Given in the do&s;e of half a grain, it acts on the &s;y&s;tem in general; but in a large do&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> gr. viij. it is &s;aid to prove emetic. In le&s;s quantity it excites in&s;ufferable pain, and mu&s;t be given &s;o as to operate directly. This Turbith Mineral is found to have effects different from any other of the preparations. The&s;e will be known from what we &s;hall afterwards &s;ay on Emetics in general. It is found to re&s;olve &s;welled te&s;ticles, when Mercury in other forms has failed: It al&s;o &s;alivates longer than many other of its preparations; but this is not peculiar to it.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="014000_0459_0F928A1468523078">
In the inte&s;tines, the &s;timulus of the mercurial preparations is exerted with greater effect, but &s;till it is confined to the part, and Mercury acting in this manner is carried off without any farther effects on the &s;y&s;tem. Mercurial purgatives are &s;eldom employed alone, but in conjunction with other purgative medicines, although I have known do&s;es of Calomel alone employed with advantage. When we purge, we commonly think we are operating on the common &s;ewer of the &s;y&s;tem; but little advantage is to be found from Mercury employed in this way, as its virtues depend chiefly on its operation on the body in general. As a purgative, the mo&s;t in&s;oluble preparation of Mercury is the be&s;t, and therefore Calomel is u&s;ed; but when u&s;ed in this way we are di&s;appointed if we ex|pect it &s;hould exert the other virtues of Mercury.</P>
<P>The great effects of Mercury &s;eem to be exerted when it is again carried into the ma&s;s of blood, and is united in the excretories. A diffu&s;ible preparation of it is nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, and advan|tages ari&s;e from the different determinations. Mercury &s;eems to change the whole ma&s;s of blood: This it does in three ways, by Purging, Sweating, and Salivation.</P>
<P>Purging is one of the flowe&s;t means. There may be another way than the common of making Mercury exert this action, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by introducing it into the blood, and then determining it to the in|te&s;tines. Purging is never excited by any means without &s;pa&s;ms of the inte&s;tines, which, when the operation is continued, are apt to end in durable &s;pa&s;m and inflammation. The&s;e are attended with very dangerous con&s;equences; and neither does the method of purg|ing by unction an&s;wer much better, (altho' perhaps more effectual,) becau&s;e it is attended with very great pain. The method of Douglas is, on this account, now neglected. He followed, in this method, De&s;&s;aut. Sweating is the ea&s;ie&s;t operation of Mercury that I know, but the difficulty here lies in preventing any of the others from tak|ing place.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="014000_0460_0F928A18599EF5C0">
As this of Sweating is &s;o difficult an operation, Phy&s;icians have been led to employ Salivation, which, however, is attended with many inconveniencies, as inflammation often to a dangerous degree; and it is the univer&s;al con&s;ent of Practitioners, that they employ only Salivation becau&s;e no other means can be u&s;ed. It then means be found of exciting copiou&s;ly, and keeping up a Sweat, it &s;hould be univer&s;ally practi&s;ed. We have now learned that the mo&s;t acrid pre|parations of Mercury, as the corro&s;ive &s;ublimate, are mo&s;t apt to have this effect, becau&s;e they will more readily produce that encrea&s;e of circulation, on which the encrea&s;e of this excretion depends. Here the Acrid mu&s;t be given in &s;maller quantity than will make it run to the &s;alivary glands. In a great do&s;e, indeed, the&s;e preparations are apt to inflame the &s;tomach, and if they go to the &s;alivary glands are more trouble&s;ome than others; but where this can be prevented their operation is much more ea&s;y.</P>
<P>In order to avoid the inconveniencies ari&s;ing from Salivation, rai&s;ed by the acrid preparations, the milder ones &s;hould be cho&s;en, and &s;lowly introduced, and that by way of unction. One of the incon|veniencies of a Salivation is, that when Mercury is going off by the &s;alivary glands, there are certain cau&s;es which drive it to the inte&s;|tines. This mu&s;t be guarded again&s;t; but in a medicine introduced by the mouth there is more danger of this happening, e&s;pecially as we intend it &s;hould be mild, and con&s;equently le&s;s &s;oluble; whereas by unction it can be given &s;lowly without that effect; and for the me|thod of exhibition, A&s;truc's directions are the be&s;t. All the&s;e vari|ous preparations vary according to regimen.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now proceed to the particular di&s;ea&s;es in which Mercury is u&s;eful; but as its action is never &s;pecific, and only as an evacuant in general, I &s;hall decline this at pre&s;ent. It is ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inly one of the mo&s;t univer&s;al Deob&s;truents and Aperients yet known.

<HEAD>EXPECTORANTIA.</HEAD>
<P>Expectorants have been much talked of, but little under&s;tood.

By <HI>Expectorantia</HI> here, we have only in view &s;uch medicines as promote the &s;ecretion of mucus in the lungs. To talk of the&s;e is difficult. I have &s;et down a long li&s;t; but, after attending a thou&s;and times to their operation, I am not able to &s;ay whether the effect produced depended upon the medicine, or nature. This &s;hews the uncer|tainty, not only of medicines acting on the fluids, but of &s;uch as are thence depo&s;ited on the excretories, they being liable to &s;o many changes in the <HI>primae viae, &amp;c.</HI> before they get thither. Expecto|rants have been &s;uppo&s;ed attenuant. The difficulties regarding &s;uch a power have been formerly mentioned. This &s;uppo&s;ition has been of bad con&s;equence in practice, having led us to employ a great num|ber of acrid medicines in this intention. On this head Dr. Boer|haave has been extremely u&s;eful. In his Chemi&s;try he very properly cautions us again&s;t the u&s;e of medicines of an acrid kind, in di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t. In &s;o far as our Expectorants are attenuant, they act only as &s;timulating the excretories. Po&s;&s;ibly another action of them may occur, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that of anti&s;pa&s;modic. Some medicines are diapho|retic from this quality, and hence I imagine <HI>A&s;&s;a foetida</HI> acts as ex|pectorant rather from its anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue, by which it removes the ob&s;truction of mucus.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our fir&s;t plants in the Catalogue were mentioned among the <HI>Verticillatae.</HI> They all contain an e&s;&s;ential oil, acrid and inflam|matory.

<P>The next three, <HI>Iris Florentina, Nicotiana,</HI> and <HI>Scilla,</HI> are all emetic and purgative, only pectoral in con&s;equence of a common and univer&s;al &s;timulus, and in &s;o far as by any means their other qualities are taken off.</P>
<P>IRIS FLORENTINA, in its recent &s;tate, is very acrid, but lo&s;es that acrimony by drying, when, if it has any virtue at all, it is that of expectorant.</P>
<P>NICOTIANA, under any preparation, is more powerful than the former, and may de&s;erve the prai&s;es of <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers; but its acrimony, and &s;en&s;ible qualities, prevent its frequent exhibition.</P>

SCILLA is an univer&s;al &s;timulant and remarkably acrid &s;ub&s;tance. It acts as an Emetic, and in that intention is frequently employed, whe|ther with any particular advantage I cannot determine. It is al&s;o purgative, with a hydragogue effect. Among Haller's Di&s;&s;ertations, there are two upon Squills, where its con&s;iderable effect in hydro|pic ca&s;es is ob&s;erved, and that large do&s;es of it have proved a cure; but in &s;uch ca&s;e it is merely on the footing of the common hydra|gogue purgatives. Carried into the blood, the Squill is diuretic; but in that view it oftener di&s;appoints than an&s;wers our intention. Its pectoral effects, though much cried up, as well as its diuretic, are very liable to deceive us; and it is very difficult to introduce the medicine &s;o far. The only chance we have of &s;ucceeding, is this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the di&s;&s;ipation of the more volatile parts, by which means we prevent the immediate action in the &s;tomach, and have a better chance of introducing our medicine, in greater quantity, into the ma&s;s of blood. Hence almo&s;t always they &s;hould be u&s;ed dry. This drying, however, &s;hould have bounds, which cannot be well fixed by a Phy&s;ician. If Squills be dried in tunicles, it does not an&s;wer, and therefore it is very proper to cut it tran&s;ver&s;ely; for otherwi&s;e the drying is prevented, by the membrane covering the tunicles. When we want to extract the Squill by vinegar, in order to mitigate its ta&s;te, or whenever we are to infu&s;e it in wine, or water, it &s;hould always be in a dry &s;tate; and this is a general rule with regard to all plants; for their common juices hinder the application of any men&s;truum. Hence the London <HI>Acetum &s;cilli|ticum</HI> is preferable to the Edinburgh. <HI>Oxymel &s;cilliticum,</HI> with all the other <HI>Mellita,</HI> &s;hould be rejected from the Di&s;pen&s;atory. We have indu&s;triou&s;ly cho&s;en fre&s;h Squills in the <HI>Pilulae &s;cilliticae.</HI> The&s;e Squills &s;uffer a change by drying, &s;o that their do&s;e is very uncertain, and they become in&s;oluble; wherefore, in this preparation al&s;o, the dry Squills &s;hould be employed.</P>

From experience, I have great rea|&s;on to believe Dr. Fuller in the right, and that <HI>Tu&s;&s;ilago</HI> will &s;uc|ceed where &s;alt water has failed. I u&s;ed it in different &s;hapes. I employed the recent juice in the quantity of three ounces or eight ounces a day, and when the juice could not be procured, I u&s;ed, like Fuller, the dry herb in decoction, and I believe with greater advantage. I find the di&s;ea&s;e oftene&s;t in the &s;pring, at which time the fre&s;h herb is not in &s;o perfect a &s;tate as it may attain, and there|fore I believe the decoction will be found the mo&s;t convenient, as well as effectual method of exhibition.

<HEAD>EMETICA.</HEAD>
<P>What Vomiting is, it is not nece&s;&s;ary for me to define; and in what &s;tate of the &s;tomach it con&s;i&s;ts, I leave to Pathologi&s;ts. With regard to this head, it would &s;eem unnece&s;&s;ary to mention the various effects of Vomiting; but as I find the effects of particular Emetics are not to be under&s;tood without a knowledge of the effects of Vomiting in general, and as I have little to &s;ay on particular Emetics, I &s;hall enter a little upon that enquiry. Fir&s;t, then, as to the various effects of Vomiting, or a &s;tate of the &s;tomach analogous to it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Vomiting evacuates the contents of the &s;tomach it&s;elf. It is not ea&s;y to know when that is fully performed. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that various matters may be detained in the <HI>plicae,</HI> or <HI>mucus,</HI> &s;o that frequent ablution mu&s;t be required. Many have got now into a me|thod of promoting few repetitions in Vomiting, and giving &s;mall ablutions; but I think I can maintain, that by this method we di&s;|appoint our&s;elves of the effects to be obtained from a full evacua|tion. Small quantities of a medicine may excite vomiting, but that they will produce a full evacuation is very doubtful.</P>
<P N="2">2. Vomiting cau&s;es a flow of liquors to the &s;tomach, purges it, (if I may &s;o &s;ay,) and emulges its mucous glands; which operation
<PB N="461" REF="014000_0467_0F928A1E34AA5C60">
&s;eems not occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulus, but produced in the &s;ame manner as in Senac's experiments.</P>
<P N="3">3. Vomiting not only emulges the mucous follicles of the &s;to|mach, and promotes a flow of ga&s;tric liquor, but has the &s;ame effect in the neighbouring glands, e&s;pecially the pancreas and liver.</P>
<P N="4">4. While Vomiting continues, it not only inverts the peri&s;taltic motion of the &s;tomach it&s;elf, but al&s;o of the inte&s;tines, which pour out their mucus to be carried to the &s;tomach, and evacuated with its contents. This &s;erves to explain the throwing up of bile, but is by no means the common cau&s;e of it, for it is manife&s;tly produced by &s;queezing of the liver and gall bladder, a proof of which is, that it occurs at the end of the operation; which throwing up of bile is, not without rea&s;on, thought a te&s;t of a Vomit's perfect operation, and was the rule to &s;top, of a Phy&s;ician who employed Vomiting as a <HI>panacea.</HI> As &s;queezing the liver and gall bladder, Vomiting may pu&s;h biliary &s;tones into the inte&s;tines, and cure the jaundice; of which, however, I have frequently &s;een it a cau&s;e, becau&s;e Vomiting, by the &s;ame method of operation, might force the &s;tone into the duct. As inverting the peri&s;taltic motion, Vomits are u&s;eful in diarrhoea and dy&s;entery; but, independent of that, they are probably more u&s;eful as purging the inte&s;tines, occa&s;ioning a greater flow of liquors into the inte&s;tinal canal, which, if the Vomiting continues, are ejected by the &s;tomach; a proof of which is, that the faeces are often thrown up; which again, by the bye, &s;hews that the inte&s;tines may be inverted in the whole track. If the Vomiting cea&s;es, the encrea&s;ed &s;ecretion is carried off by &s;tool, &s;o that, at any rate, the adherent foulne&s;s is wa&s;hed away. This al&s;o explains another point, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that, independent of being carried thither, Emetics may be purgative, by &s;queezing the track of in|te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">&punc;</P>
<P N="5">5. Vomiting &s;queezes, and occa&s;ions a con&s;triction of the whole abdominal vi&s;cera, e&s;pecially the me&s;enteric glands, and in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="462" REF="014000_0468_0F928A1EF248C998">
pumps the whole lymphatic &s;y&s;tem. On this account Vomiting has the power of encrea&s;ing ab&s;orption, as al&s;o from its evacuating property. Purges are, indeed, more frequent|ly employed in that intention, but Emetics an&s;wer equally well. There are &s;everal in&s;tances of the waters of hydropic per&s;ons evacuated by Vomiting, and I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve &s;uch a ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. As Vomiting occa&s;ions a con&s;triction, &s;queezes and emulges the whole abdomen, &s;o I imagine it has the power of affecting the kidneys. Emetics indeed, commonly do &s;o, but this may be &s;aid to be owing to the quantity of water drank along with them; but I think a great deal depends on the con&s;ent between the two organs; for as irritation of the kidney will produce Vomiting, &s;o, on the other hand, it is rea&s;onable to think that Vomiting may al&s;o act upon the kidney. Hence, Vomiting would &s;eem u&s;eful in pro|pelling &s;tones in the kidneys. This, indeed, is difficult to determine, and &s;ome have imagined they are always dangerous in nephritic ca&s;es. As to my&s;elf, I confe&s;s I am afraid of them, but others u&s;e them with &s;ucce&s;s and &s;afety; and thus much may be &s;aid for the practice, that it &s;eems to be an imitation of Nature, which often excites a Vomiting in the ca&s;es mentioned, and probably for good purpo&s;es. So much for the effect of Vomiting in the abdomen.</P>
<P N="7">7. The&s;e effects are, perhaps, extended to the vi&s;cera of the thorax. I have ob&s;erved to you, that the promoting of expec|toration was very doubtful: I have &s;een it much oftener ef|fected by Vomiting than by any other means. We may here ob&s;erve, that the action of Vomiting is attended with ob&s;truc|tion of in&s;piration, as vomiting can only take place when the diaphragm is relaxed in ex&s;piration. The application of this will appear afterwards.</P>
<P N="8">8. Vomiting encrea&s;es the con&s;triction of the fauces, and forcibly emulges the whole of the mucus and &s;alivary glands. I have &s;een
<PB N="463" REF="014000_0469_0F928A1FAC2404B0">
it have the effect of ma&s;ticatories, relieving rheumatic affections of the head, tooth-ach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>By preventing in&s;piration, Vomiting occa&s;ions the regurgitation of the blood which u&s;ually happens at the end of expiration. The accumulating of blood produced by Vomiting is only momentary, and may be &s;oon counterpoi&s;ed, as we &s;hall &s;ee by con&s;idering its advantageous effects on the &s;y&s;tem in general.</P>
<P N="1">1. During the time of Vomiting the pul&s;e is &s;mall, weak, and intermitting.</P>
<P N="2">2. If when Vomiting is over, the &s;timulus continues, the circula|tion is encrea&s;ed, with a fulne&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s of the pul&s;e, a determi|nation to the &s;urface of the body, and &s;weat; this la&s;t may be &s;up|po&s;ed to proceed from the encrea&s;ed circulation; but it may al&s;o from the con&s;ent of the &s;tomach and &s;urface; and I think it is probable, that here, as in other ca&s;es, an anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue takes place with regard to the extreme ve&s;&s;els, which is illu&s;trated from this, that Emetics, combined with other Anti&s;pa&s;modics, as Opium, encrea&s;e the virtue; &s;o that combined they become more power|ful Diaphoretics than each when alone.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the primary effects of Emetics. With regard to the &s;econdary, it is impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate them all here. They will ea&s;ily be deduced from their emptying the &s;tomach, and encrea&s;ing &s;ecretion and circulation, which may be a part of their anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue, e&s;pecially in the extremity of the ve&s;&s;els, as in the ca&s;e of Fevers. On the con&s;ideration of the&s;e we mu&s;t not enter at pre&s;ent. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that as the animal oeconomy has numberle&s;s means of preventing di&s;ea&s;e, the Vomiting excited in the beginning of Fe|vers &s;eems to be for good intention; and though it does not always cure, it may ju&s;tly give indication.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="014000_0470_0F928A2069C953A0">
After thus mentioning the operation of Emetics, with regard to their &s;alutary effects, we &s;hall next mention the ca&s;es where they are forbid.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are forbid in all ca&s;es of firm and ob&s;tinate ob&s;truction, not to be overcome by the force of circulation. Hence in inveterate Scirrho&s;ities, in Calculi firmly impacted in the biliary ducts, Emetics &s;hould not &s;eem proper to be given; but as we have mentioned the uncertainty of the rule in the&s;e ca&s;es, it may po&s;&s;ibly be liable to the &s;ame in others. Po&s;&s;ibly in Scirrho&s;ity, Vomiting not only extends its effects to the gland, but to the ve&s;&s;els in the place of the ob&s;truction. This doubt &s;hould point out an enquiry into the u&s;e of Emetics in the ca&s;e of &s;cirrhous vi&s;cera. They have been known to be u&s;ed with &s;afety. There is one ca&s;e, however, where caution ought certainly to be u&s;ed with regard to them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> when the parts are lax and tender. In Scurvy, where there is a laxity of the ve&s;&s;els, and in Cachexy, where there is the &s;ame tender|ne&s;s. Vomiting mu&s;t then be hurtful, and accordingly Phy&s;icians ob&s;erve, that they are dangerous wherever there are &s;tagnating putrefactive humours.</P>
<P N="2">2. Wherever there is an encrea&s;ed impetus already, we &s;hould judge <HI>a priori</HI> that Vomiting is hurtful; but as it cannot be proved that it encrea&s;es the inflammatory diathe&s;is, Vomiting may happen to be employed with &s;afety. Dr. Robin&s;on gives in&s;tances of inflammatory ca&s;es where it was u&s;eful. He &s;eems, indeed, pre|judiced, and I have not tried its effects, but I have &s;een it employed in Peripneumony and Pleuri&s;y. Pleuritic pain was not encrea&s;ed by it, which &s;eemed to depend on Vomiting &s;topping in&s;piration, in which that increa&s;e is felt; but &s;till in other ca&s;es the Vomiting was hurtful, and much ambiguity occurs with regard to it, as I have learned from the practice of the per&s;on whom I mentioned as u&s;ing Emetics in every in&s;tance. I &s;hould not think in topical affections that Vomiting without bleeding could be &s;afely pre&s;cribed. It is not
<PB N="465" REF="014000_0471_0F928A21486F4D40">
u&s;ed, as is agreed upon, in topical affections of the &s;tomach it&s;elf, or in topical affections of the neighbouring vi&s;cera.</P>
<P N="3">3. In Haemorrhagy it is not certain whether it is &s;alutary. Robin&s;on, in his E&s;&s;ay on Emetics, maintains there is no more u&s;eful remedy in Haemorrhage univer&s;ally, and he gives examples of its good effects; and I have &s;een confirmation of what he ad|vances. The &s;ame Dr. Robin&s;on gave Emetics in &s;pitting of blood. In the Infirmary I have exhibited them without bad effect, and perhaps it was for want of courage to continue them that they did not work a cure. There are certainly ca&s;es where they may be u&s;eful; and uterine Haemorrhage has been cured by the <HI>&s;tibium ceratum</HI> when it vomited; and I have employed Ipecacuan with the &s;ame effects as well as Dr. Robin&s;on. In Dy&s;entery the good effects of Emetics are certainly confirmed, and they may be here in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>All this contradicts our theory. It may be &s;aid, that in the time of Vomiting a con&s;triction takes place over the whole body; but Robin&s;on ob&s;erves, that the circulation is &s;oon encrea&s;ed, which is certainly incon&s;i&s;tent with the cure of Haemorrhagy. Robin&s;on is of opinion, that Vomiting acts in con&s;equence of re&s;toring an equa|ble circulation. I imagine &s;omething el&s;e mu&s;t be taken in. In Haemorrhagy, as Dr. Hoffman ob&s;erves, a &s;pa&s;modic affection often takes place, and Vomiting may act by taking off that &s;pa&s;m. This rea&s;oning de&s;erves at lea&s;t con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="4">4. Emetics are very dangerous in conge&s;tions of the head, in apoplexy, pal&s;y, and in &s;maller collections in the veins of the brain. Vomiting may be &s;uppo&s;ed to pu&s;h &s;uch to the utmo&s;t violence, and to cau&s;e a rupture of the ve&s;&s;els on which they depend. Many, however, alledge they are u&s;eful. It may be &s;aid their con&s;trictory power obviates their other effects. Indeed, I do not remember, in the annals of Phy&s;ic, a fatal apoplexy produced by Vomiting. As
<PB N="466" REF="014000_0472_0F928A235B709110">
this effect, then, is not to be expected, their other good properties may then take place; and I have &s;een in&s;tances of them; though in tho&s;e in&s;tances they were exhibited much at random, nor can I particularize tho&s;e in which they are proper.</P>
<P>From the whole of what we have &s;aid, it appears, that the bad effects of Vomiting are precarious, the good undoubted, and that its real virtue favours, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the &s;uppo&s;ition entertained by the practitioner we had occa&s;ion to mention, of their being a <HI>panacea.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PARTICULAR EMETICS.</HEAD>
<P>Particular Emetics differ in degree of acrimony, and in extent of their effects. I have forgot to mark in my Catalogue the great variety of them, and their gradation. I &s;hould have mentioned <HI>Warm Water,</HI> which operates, from its bulk, in the &s;ame manner as cold water, and al&s;o from its nau&s;ea. Impregnated with oil, it becomes more powerful, and the &s;ame with bitters, and other nau|&s;eous additions. Next to the&s;e, Mu&s;tard and Hor&s;e-radi&s;h exceed in acrimony; and more acrid and more powerful than the&s;e are Squills, which indeed, if given dried, and in &s;ufficient do&s;e, are as acrid as any other emetics. After fre&s;h Squills, and exceeding them in power, is to be placed Ipecacuan; and exceeding that again <HI>Erige|rum, A&s;arum,</HI> and <HI>Nicotiana.</HI> With regard to the gradation of the three la&s;t, I am not certain; <HI>Erigerum</HI> is more mild than the <HI>A&s;arum.</HI> As to the rank of the fo&s;&s;il Emetics, neither am I certain with regard to it.

<HEAD>ANTIMONY.</HEAD>
<P>Antimony began very early to be the favourite of the chemical pur&s;uits. It certainly affords us &s;ome very efficacious remedies, and this very efficacy of it was brought as an objection again&s;t its u&s;e, till of late the&s;e prejudices have been triumphed over, and its credit re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; not but that even now it is attended with &s;ome doubts. I &s;hall therefore bring to your view its various preparations, &s;hew the foundation of each, and their relation to each other.</P>
<P>Antimony con&s;i&s;ts of a Regulus and Sulphur; this Sulphur was, for a long time, imagined to be of a particular kind, but this is now found to be erroneous; hence its peculiar medical virtues mu&s;t re&s;ide in its Regulus. To procure this, various means have been thought of and practi&s;ed, which is a proof of the confu&s;ion of their chemical knowledge. But they are all founded on the general rules applicable to the &s;melting of metals. We &s;hall &s;peak of two kinds. Fir&s;t, <HI>Simplex,</HI> with fixed alkalies; or, &s;econdly, <HI>Martialis,</HI> when with Iron.</P>
<P>The Chemi&s;ts, indeed, have employed different metals, imagin|ing they imparted different virtues to the Regulus, and even a com|bination of them; but the differences are rather in the quantity than quality of the Regulus; the pre&s;cription of the London Col|lege coincides with the fir&s;t method, where the Black Flux is u&s;ed. The Crude Antimony and the Flux are ground together, and then thrown, in &s;mall parcels, into a hot crucible; a deflagration en&s;ues, and the Regulus is precipitated; part of the Sulphur is di&s;&s;ipated with the nitrous Acid, part forms a <HI>Hepar Sulphuris</HI> with the re|maining fixed Alk, which di&s;&s;olves &s;ome of the Regulus; for the purpo&s;es of arts, therefore, the Regulus is never prepared in this way, but by the other, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Martialis.</HI> Iron is here added to ab&s;orb the Sulphur; but if too great a quantity is added, the &s;uper|fluity will unite with the Regulus. With regard to Iron, indeed, this addition would be harmle&s;s, but not &s;o if we made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e of other
<PB N="468" REF="014000_0474_0F928A24277CAC50">
metals. When we have thus get the Regulus pure, we have a &s;ub|&s;tance capable of being acted on by the acid in the Stomach, hence the <HI>Perpetual Pills,</HI> which are emetic and cathartic. This is the only &s;hape in which the pure Regulus is employed.</P>
<P>Crude Antimony &s;hould, from a general principle, be inert, as we have &s;aid of Mercury combined with Sulphur, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but tho' experi|ment confirms that in general, and I have given it triturated to two drachms without any effect; I have no le&s;s &s;een it rai&s;e a vomiting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> like the other preparations. This we mu&s;t account for from the different &s;trength of the Acid in different per&s;ons, and in the &s;ame per&s;on at different times. Moreover, different portions of Antimony have different quantities of Sulphur, and it is alledged, that even the &s;ame c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ne differs in different parts of it, that there is more Sulphur at the ba&s;is than at the apex. Hence in pre&s;criptions we have di|rections what part to take it from. From this uncertainty of the ma|terial circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary to its action, its crude &s;tate is looked on as an inaccurate medicine. To render it more certain we ab&s;tract part of its Sulphur, and that is done,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, by Alkalies. If Crude Antimony is fu&s;ed with four-fifths of its weight of common &s;alt, and one-fifth of a fixed Alkali, the Re|gulus falls to the bottom, and the Sulphur floats on its &s;urface in form of <HI>Scoriae.</HI> This is the <HI>Regulus medicinalis.</HI> This was taken from a pre&s;cription in great vogue in Germany, called the <HI>Febrifugium Cranii.</HI> The common &s;alt is added only to float on its &s;urface, and prevent the acce&s;s of the air. This proce&s;s has been variou&s;ly diver&s;ified; &s;ome have cho&s;e to add vitriolated Tar|tar. The ready fu&s;ion of this is a curious circum&s;tance; but the effect is &s;imilar to the foregoing.</P>
<P>Another method is the preparation of the Kermes Mineral. This was a curious &s;ecret in France, fir&s;t invented by Glauber, afterwards in the hands of the Carthu&s;ians, at length the prepara|tion was purcha&s;ed by the French King, and made known.</P>
<P><PB N="469" REF="014000_0475_0F928A26361D4968">
A quantity of Crude Antimony is boiled in a lixivium of Salt of Tartar; the Sulphur forms a Hepar with the fixed Alk&punc; and &s;u&s;|pends part of the Regulus. When this is decanted and &s;et to cool, part of the Regulus with its Sulphur falls to the bottom in a red powder. The quantity of Sulphur is not, however, &s;ufficient to prevent its being acted on by the Acid of the Stomach.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sulphur auratum Antimonii</HI> is of the &s;ame nature, but milder than the foregoing. There are various ways of making it; one is of taking the &s;coriae of the <HI>Regulus &s;implex,</HI> and putting them into boiling water; on cooling it falls down in a powder. The Chemi&s;ts thought this too &s;imple a proce&s;s, and hence thought proper to add Acids, which precipitate the Sulphur in greater quan|tity, but of le&s;s efficacy, and le&s;s impregnated with Antimony. But there is no certainty in any of the&s;e; for they will vary accord|ing to the different times of the precipitation; the different &s;ub&s;ida|tions of the &s;ame proce&s;s &s;hould be intimately mixed; but we never can be &s;ure that we have the &s;ame power in different pre|parations.</P>
<P>Antimony is likewi&s;e deprived of part of its Sulphur by Nitre. I am not certain of the accuracy of attributing this &s;eparation to the Nitre, but it is rather owing to the action of its parts &s;epa|rately, in the decompo&s;ition of it, when the Acid carries off part of the Sulphur with it, while the Alkaline ab&s;orbs the re&s;t, and forms an Hepar Sulphuris. This proce&s;s is diver&s;ified according to the quantities of Nitre u&s;ed. If we u&s;e an eighth part we ob|tain the <HI>Regulus Antimonii medicinalis;</HI> only as we increa&s;e the quan|tity we make the preparation more and more acrid, till we arrive at equal parts of each, which is the <HI>Crocus Metallorum.</HI> If we go on increa&s;ing the Nitre it grows milder; on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, if we u&s;e one and a half of Nitre to one of Antimony, we obtain the <HI>Crocus Metallorum mitis;</HI> if two parts of Nitre to one of Antimony, we obtain the <HI>Pulvis Cornachini,</HI> or James's Powder, or the <HI>Emeti|cum mite</HI> of Boerhaave.</P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="014000_0476_0F928A266CCE61F8">
I never could di&s;cover the power of diaphoretic Antimony; for three parts of Nitre will render it an inert &s;ub&s;tance. I believe we &s;hould to four of Antimony take only &s;even, perhaps &s;ix and an half of Nitre; nay, perhaps only &s;ix; we may then get a powder that will act as an Emetic and Diaphoretic; but it is not reduced to any proper &s;tandard.</P>
<P>Secondly, by Calcination. If we treat it with a heat le&s;s than is nece&s;&s;ary for its fu&s;ion, we do much the &s;ame as by adding Al|kali, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> de&s;troy part of the Sulphur; but as we continue to eva|porate more Sulphur we calcine more of the Metal, and during the calcination &s;omething is added to the Metal from the fire, which renders it inert; but if we afterwards encrea&s;e the fire &s;uddenly, we bring it to a gla&s;s, and in that &s;tate it is capable of being acted on by all the Acids.</P>
<P>Thirdly, by Sublimation. The <HI>Flores Antimonii</HI> are procured by joining aludels to each other, and then &s;ubliming the Anti|mony. In the farthe&s;t aludel we &s;hall find mo&s;t Sulphur, in the neare&s;t mo&s;t Antimony.</P>

<P>With the Muriatic. Antimony may be combined with this in different ways, but not conveniently, unle&s;s it is in a concentrated form. Different compounds are therefore made u&s;e of for this pur|po&s;e, but chiefly the Corro&s;ive Sublimate. In this ca&s;e the Muri|atic Acid joins the Antimonial Regulus, while the Mercury unites with the Sulphur.

<P>The &s;pirituous &s;trong Portugue&s;e wines are not &s;o good for this purpo&s;e; the lighter French wines, or the more acid, as the Rheni&s;h, make a &s;tronger &s;olution of it, and our own home-brewed wines exceed either.

<HEAD>Of the MEDICAL VIRTUES of ANTIMONY.</HEAD>
<P>Antimony is purely &s;timulant, it no where &s;hews any a&s;tringent, tonic, or &s;edative power, or, if it ever does, it is in con&s;equence of its &s;timulus. It certainly &s;timulates very readily, as a very &s;mall quantity will act as an Emetic. It has long been a great de&s;idera|tum to get a preparation that would act on the other parts of the
<PB N="473" REF="014000_0479_0F928A28A8185010">
&s;y&s;tem without this effect. When it pa&s;&s;es the &s;tomach, and acts only on the inte&s;tines, it acts as a Purgative. I doubt much if it acts as a Diuretic or Sudorific by being properly applied to the or|gans of the&s;e evacuations, and rather imagine that it produces the&s;e effects by acting on the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines. It is difficult to conceive this, though we evidently &s;ee its effects on the &s;urface or kidneys, &s;ometimes before it can po&s;&s;ibly have arrived there. Other Emetics certainly do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It is certain, from matter of fact, that, from its action on the &s;ur|face, it can both &s;timulate and relax the ve&s;&s;els on the &s;urface of the body, but this is common to it with other Emetics, to produce con&s;trictions on the &s;urface, and hence its &s;ervice in haemorrhages; that, however, is in con&s;equence of the nau&s;ea it creates.</P>

<HEAD>Of its FEBRIFUGE QUALITY.</HEAD>
<P>It is no difficult matter to &s;hew te&s;timonies of efficacy, adduced in favour of the mo&s;t inert medicines. But I allow that practition|ers of candor and di&s;cernment acknowledge the virtue of James's powder; and, indeed, the <HI>Pulvis Cornachini</HI> and <HI>Antiquartzium of Riverius,</HI> medicines of a &s;imilar nature, have been extolled with the &s;ame commendations.

Such a proportion of Nitre &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary as will leave it to be acted on by the acid of the &s;tomach, and that &s;timu|lus &s;hould not be too great, but that it &s;hould &s;uffer it to pa&s;s into the inte&s;tines. For this purpo&s;e Cornachinus adds Scammony, and James adds Mercury, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> a preparation of it in the Nitrous Acid.

<HEAD>CATHARTICA.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e are medicines which evacuate by &s;tool. They are called Cathartics, or Purgers, by way of emmence, from a gro&s;s view, they being &s;uppo&s;ed to carry off all the impurities of the body; but the term mu&s;t be con&s;idered only as metaphorical. Here, as under the head of Emetics, we &s;hall mention the effects of the medicines at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="1">1. They evacuate the ordinary contents of the Inte&s;tines. As this is a nece&s;&s;ary operation of the animal oeconomy, and not occa|&s;ional and accidental, as in the ca&s;e of vomits, they have been con&s;idered as medicines friendly to nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be&s;ides evacuation, by exciting a more active peri&s;taltic motion, Cathartics &s;queeze out the glands of the Inte&s;tines, and occa&s;ion a greater afflux of inte&s;tinal liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As operating on the whole alimentary canal, they draw al&s;o from the &s;tomach. Whether it is peculiar to any to be &s;tomach purgers, we may afterwards con&s;ider. From all the&s;e con&s;iderations, their evacuating property mu&s;t be very great.</P>
<P N="4">4. They al&s;o evacuate the whole glands of the Inte&s;tines, and tho&s;e which pour their liquors into them, particularly the pancreas and liver, by expeding the circulation, in which la&s;t they have effect on the &s;pleen, and all the abdominal vi&s;cera. If there is a certain con|nection between &s;ecretion and ab&s;orption, by encrea&s;ing the former they promote the latter. Hence they are called Hydragogues, not only as evacuating, but occa&s;ioning the ab&s;orption of water which has &s;tagnated in any cavity.</P>
<P>From this view of their operation our medicines might be con|&s;idered as Cathartics in general, and if the evacuation be continued
<PB N="475" REF="014000_0481_0F928A2A28C560C0">
for a length of time, they may mo&s;t certainly purge the whole body. But this con&s;tant evacuation is not to be &s;upported except by repe|tition of acrid medicines, which is a dangerous practice, and only to be applied to bodies of a lax flaccid kind, &s;o that &s;till we mu&s;t refu&s;e them as general purgers. Upon this plan we may object to their u&s;e in the <HI>Lues venerea,</HI> and I doubt whether we can ever con|tinue them &s;o long without danger, as to change the whole ma&s;s of fluids. Hence the di&s;charge by &s;alivation, urine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is preferable. You &s;ee even the &s;ame objection holds again&s;t Salivation, and this becau&s;e both are attended with inflammation of the parts where the medicine is collected and applied.</P>
<P N="5">5. The evacuation by &s;tool, and derivation to the inte&s;tines, nece&s;&s;arily determines more blood into the de&s;cending aorta, whereby they make a revul&s;ion from the head, and I have no doubt of their encrea&s;ing every evacuation made from the extremities of the de|&s;cending aorta, &s;o that, therefore, Cathartics may very probably be con&s;idered as promoting the men&s;trual flux, opening ob&s;truction in the uterus, and u&s;eful in wa&s;hing off the virulency of <HI>Gonorrhoea,</HI> u&s;e|ful in Ulcers, by evacuating the &s;y&s;tem in general; to Ulcers in the inferior part of the body, as cau&s;ing a greater flow to the part.</P>
<P N="6">6. Cathartics have a &s;timulant power, which, as applied in the inte&s;tines, excites, or at lea&s;t aggravates inflammation in them; nay, &s;ome of them there are which will propagate the &s;ame over the &s;y&s;tem. Again, there is hardly a purgative, which, conveyed into the ma&s;s of blood, is not diuretic and pectoral. The&s;e are in general the ope|rations of Cathartics, but it may be proper al&s;o to point out more particularly &s;ome of their bad effects.</P>
<P>As repeated Emetics weaken the &s;tomach, &s;o Cathartics often re|newed, dimini&s;h the tone of the inte&s;tines, and their &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;o,</P>
<P N="1">1. Partly by this, and partly in con&s;equence of mere evacuation, their frequent u&s;e renders the inte&s;tines very liable to irregular &s;pa&s;|modic affections.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="476" REF="014000_0482_0F928A2AF245ACB8">
2. Of mo&s;t Purgatives the acrimony is of an inflammatory na|ture, not only exciting inflammation in the part to which they are applied, but acting in the &s;ame manner as poi&s;ons. Narcotics, as the <HI>Nicotiana,</HI> are accounted purgative, much oftner are purga|tives narcotic.</P>
<P N="3">3. The inflammatory &s;timulus is extended to the &s;y&s;tem, and pro|duces or aggravates Fever and inflammatory Diathe&s;is.</P>
<P N="4">4. Their inflammatory &s;timulus is directed to the <HI>rectum,</HI> through which the whole acrid matter mu&s;t pa&s;s. Hence all Purgatives encrea&s;e haemorrhoidal &s;wellings.</P>
<P N="5">5. They not only inflame the <HI>rectum,</HI> but al&s;o extend the ir|ritation to the <HI>urethra.</HI> The&s;e effects are varied in particular ca&s;es. This fini&s;hes what we were to &s;ay on the good and bad qua|lities of Cathartics in general.</P>
<P>PARTICULAR CATHARTICS are of two kinds. Acids poured more copiou&s;ly into the bile, give it a purgative quality, and the &s;ame effect will en&s;ue from a more copious Acid produced in the &s;tomach pa&s;&s;ing into the in|te&s;tines. The two kinds of Cathartics then, are, 1. Acids, or ace&s;cent aliment; 2. Medicinal &s;timulants, who&s;e acrimony is fitted to purge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fructus acido dulces; Prunes, Tamarinds,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia; Serum lactis, Lac ebutyratum,</HI> and <HI>Olera blanda,</HI> have all their chief effect in con&s;equence of their ace&s;cency in the &s;tomach. In &s;o far as they contain &s;ugar, they &s;timulate the inte&s;tines, which we may conclude from the effect of &s;ugar it&s;elf applied in gly&s;ters.</P>
<P>Medicinal &s;timulants differ greatly in their degree of acrimony, and &s;o in their purgative effects. It were proper to arrange them
<PB N="477" REF="014000_0483_0F928A2E96ADD8E0">
in this order. Fir&s;t, I would put <HI>common water,</HI> which, in con|&s;iderable quantity, is purgative, operating by its bulk, &s;timulating the peri&s;taltic motion, thus pu&s;hing forwards the contents fa&s;ter, and evading the ab&s;orption by the Lacteals. Thus many Mineral-waters act.</P>
<P>Next I would in&s;ert <HI>Bland expre&s;&s;ed oils;</HI> the&s;e, when taken in &s;uch quantity as to evade changes in the &s;tomach, may prove laxa|tive, but, like water, I believe it is chiefly from their bulk. Simple oil is employed in the <HI>Colica Pictonum.</HI> I have &s;een it given in the quantity of one pound, but its action &s;eemed always to be in the way we alledge.</P>
<P>After the&s;e we may place <HI>Soap.</HI> With regard to the operation of this, I am doubtful. Though mild to the ta&s;te, it has the power of &s;timulating the inte&s;tines, and proving purgative. This it will &s;ometimes do in the quantity of one drachm, and at other times the effect is not con&s;iderable from two ounces. This has led me to imagine, that Soap has no effect but when decompounded in the &s;tomach. Soap, as contaminated with common &s;alt, may owe &s;ome of its purgative quality to it. Accordingly, upon u&s;ing the Soap made by Lewes's direction, free from common &s;alt, I never found it pur|gative.</P>
<P>Following this I &s;hall mention <HI>Sulphur,</HI> which, in its perfect &s;tate, is mild and brand. The theory of the action of this is as difficult as that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oap, for, in &s;pite of its mildne&s;s, it is &s;timu|lating to the inte&s;tines. Whether our fluids have the power of di&s;&s;olving it, I cannot &s;ay. It is certainly a mild and &s;afe Cathartic, never producing my con&s;iderable evacuation, but keeping up the natural excretion without any irritating or heating effects. I have frequently had occa&s;ion to employ it, where irritation would have been harmful, and co&s;tivene&s;s encrea&s;ed the di&s;ea&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in uterine and hae|morrhoidal haemorrhagy, and there it was effectual without incon|venience. Sulphur has been accu&s;ed of griping, but I imagine this is owing to its having &s;uffered that delique&s;cence to which we
<PB N="478" REF="014000_0484_0F928A30A907F7A0">
know it is liable&punc; for in that condition its purgative property di&s;|appears, and the griping takes place, which gives us a caution to u&s;e our Sulphur always in a mild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, or previou&s;ly to wa&s;h it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here in&s;ert one or two medicines, of which I am not cer|tain whether they be entirely in their place. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> is capable of &s;timulating the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines. Its effect, as a purgative, is only to be obtained when it is entire, and then given in the quan|tity of half an ounce or one ounce; if not purgative, it keeps up a regular excretion.</P>
<P>Next I would place <HI>Bile,</HI> which, as &s;uited by nature to promote evacuation, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have that effect when introduced into the body in a larger proportion. Accordingly it has been recom|mended. I have made experiments with it; but whether it be that Bile has really no effect, or whether I may have fallen &s;hort of the proper do&s;e, it is certain I did not &s;ucceed with it. I gave in&s;pi&s;&s;ated Bile in the quantity of half a drachm, but on continued practice ne|ver found from it any &s;en&s;ible effect.</P>
<P>Approaching next to the&s;e mentioned in mildne&s;s are the <HI>Saline Purgatives,</HI> and of the&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, <HI>Sugar;</HI> and, connected with it, <HI>Honey, Manna,</HI> and the <HI>&s;weeter Fruits.</HI> Indeed their pur|gative quality &s;eems &s;omewhat contrary to their Sugar; tho&s;e con|taining mo&s;t of it not being &s;o purgative, as Tamarinds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence I would &s;ay, that none of the&s;e can be conveniently employed, ex|cept where we may put up with the effects of ace&s;cent fermen|tation.</P>

<P><HI>Tartar</HI> acts more con&s;iderably by its neutral qualities, and the <HI>Magne&s;ia Alba</HI> is only purgative as converted into a Neutral, &s;o that this is the proper place for con&s;idering <HI>Neutral Salts in general</HI> as Purgatives, and for marking out their peculiar differences. The

fixed Alkali is only purgative as converted into regenerated Tartar.</P>
<P>Where acidity prevails Magne&s;ia is preferable to other Neutrals, but it is uncertain whether it is &s;o to other ab&s;orbents.</P>
<P>Neutral Salts taken internally &s;timulate the &s;tomach, excite ap|petite, and promote dige&s;tion; hence the term <HI>dige&s;tivum</HI> applied to one of them. Since Neutral Salts are directly &s;timulant, as we &s;ee by their effects on the &s;tomach, and by their &s;ometimes pro|ducing vomiting, we give them in divided do&s;es. Some of the Neutral Salts, however, are remarkably antiemetic, &s;edative, and refrigerant. Hence their u&s;e in fevers, inflammations, and haemor|rhagy. When u&s;ed frequently, or in large quantities, they impair the tone of the &s;tomach, bring on flatulencies, and weaken the in|te&s;tines, as is &s;een by the frequent u&s;e of Nitre, Glauber's Salts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They have in &s;ome degree a &s;edative power, and &s;ometimes a dia|phoretic one, which they exert in the &s;ame manner that a draught of cold water does. They are of u&s;e in the cold fit of an ague, by promoting a critical diaphore&s;is. In like manner they &s;top vomit|ing, by determining to the &s;urface of the body. Cu&s;tom has given a preference to the Neutrals made with native vegetable acids, before the artificial, as Vinegar, but I know not upon what foundation. It is ob&s;erved, that the Neutral made with the Vola|latile Alkali, as an antiemetic and &s;udorific, is preferable to regenerated Tartar. When admitted into the inte&s;tines they act as purgatives, and pretty &s;harply; and hence, from the quantity and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence tho&s;e Neutrals that are the mo&s;t &s;timulant, as tho&s;e of the muriatic kind, are thought be&s;t in Fevers.</NOTE> &s;uddenne&s;s of the evacuation, u&s;eful in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">everi&s;h di&s;orders.

makes the&s;e Salts improper for tho&s;e who have a lax tone of their &s;tomach, as hy&s;teric and hypochondriac per&s;ons. In ob&s;ti|nate co&s;tivene&s;s they are given in &s;mall quantities, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> one quarter of a do&s;e in an hour, until the quantity of two or three do&s;es are taken, and this often with the be&s;t effect. All Neutral Salts prove purgative; but as &s;oluble Tartar has no di&s;agreeable ta&s;te, it &s;hould be, on that account, preferred, was not its operation &s;o very precari|ous, as the acid of Tartar is &s;eparated from its Alkali by every other acid, and hence would be decompo&s;ed by the acid of the &s;tomach. Hence it is generally given as an ab&s;orbent. As the quantity of fixed Alkali is but &s;mall, it will not be very purgative by the effect of the Acid it finds in the &s;tomach, as this combination is le&s;s &s;timu|lant to the inte&s;tines than &s;oluble Tartar. Regenerated Tartar has no peculiar efficacy, and when exhibited requires a large and ex|pen&s;ive do&s;e. Vitriolate Tartar is given as a purgative, in do&s;es from two to four drachms, but neither this, nor the <HI>Sal polychre&s;tum</HI> is often u&s;ed, on account of its difficult &s;olution in water, and the great increa&s;e of the bulk of the do&s;e on that account.</P>
<P>Hence Glauber's Salt is preferred, which, though of ea&s;y &s;olu|bility, have a mo&s;t nau&s;eous ta&s;te, but this may be in &s;ome degree alleviated, by the addition of Aromatics, among which I think nut|meg has the be&s;t effect, with &s;ome &s;weet &s;ub&s;tance added to it, which would coincide with the purgative intention. I find but little difference between the medical effects of the true, and the Magne&s;ia Glauber's Salt. Neutral Salts, though in the large&s;t quantities we could exhibit them, when diluted, can have very little effect upon the fluids as introduced into the body. Some have alledged, that they cool and allay the heat of the blood, be|cau&s;e all the Neutral Salts, when powdered, and thrown into water, generate cold. But it is only during their &s;olution that they have this effect; &s;o that they would be mo&s;t likely to exert the&s;e effects, if given in form of a bolus, as, when the Salts are already di&s;&s;olved, they have no farther effect in producing cold. Perhaps by their cooling power they may &s;hew &s;ome &s;mall &s;edative effects on

the &s;tomach, but the&s;e would be trifling. Their anti&s;eptic quality is very &s;mall. But although they cannot much affect the ma&s;s of blood, they &s;hew very con&s;iderable effects on the &s;ecretory organs, and hence very powerful diuretics and diaphoretics. On this may be founded the virtues of many Mineral Waters impregnated with Neutral Salts.</P>
<P>All the medicines hitherto mentioned are <HI>Eccoprotics,</HI> or tho&s;e laxatives of a more gentle and cooling kind. All tho&s;e afterwards to be mentioned mu&s;t be con&s;idered as having an inflammatory &s;timulus, though &s;till we are to &s;peak of a few which mu&s;t be &s;epa|rated from the acrid Purgatives.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e plants enumerated formerly under the title of <HI>Amara calida,</HI> are more or le&s;s purgative. <HI>Chamaemile flowers</HI> are &s;o much &s;o, that this quality is the chief hindrance of their being effectual in Intermittents.</P>
<P>More powerful than tho&s;e may be con&s;idered the <HI>Foetid gums</HI> enumerated among the Anti&s;pa&s;modics. In their purgative effect they all approach to the nature of <HI>Aloes.</HI> Though the foetids ju&s;t now taken notice of are Bitters, tho' the Bitters mentioned before them are purgative, and though Aloes be bitter, yet a Purgative is not a common quality in Bitters, and therefore in Aloes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is to be con&s;idered as a peculiar property.</P>

<P>If any medicine be entitled to the appellation of a &s;tomach purge, it is certainly Aloes. It is remarkable with regard to it, that it operates almo&s;t to as good purpo&s;e in a &s;mall as in a large do&s;e, that five grains will produce one con&s;iderable dejection, and twenty grains will do no more, except it be, that in this la&s;t do&s;e the ope|ration will be attended with gripes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Its chief u&s;e is to render the peri&s;taltic motion regular, and is one of the be&s;t cures of ha|bitual

co&s;tivene&s;s. There is a difficulty we meet with in the exhibi|tion of Purgatives, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that they will not act but in their full do&s;e, and will not produce half their effect if given in half the do&s;e. For this purpo&s;e we are chiefly confined to Aloes. Neutral Salts in half their do&s;e will not have half their effect, although even from the&s;e, by large dilution, we may obtain this property; but be&s;ides them, and our pre&s;ent medicine, I know no other which has any title to it, except Sulphur. Aloes &s;ometimes cannot be employed. It has the effect of &s;timulating the rectum more than any other, and with ju&s;tice has been accu&s;ed of exciting haemorrhoidal &s;wellings, &s;o that we ought to ab&s;tain from it in &s;uch ca&s;es, except when we want to promote them. Aloes has the effect of rarifying the blood, and di&s;po&s;ing to haemorrhagy, and hence it is not recommended in uterine fluxes. Foetid gums are of the &s;ame nature in producing haemorrhagy, and perhaps this is the foundation of their menagogue power.</P>

<HEAD>BALSAMICS.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e have the power of &s;timulating the inte&s;tines, and are next in virtue to Aloes, being very proper to overcome a co&s;tive habit, and peculiarly u&s;eful where the co&s;tivene&s;s is attended with great &s;pa&s;ms, as in the dry belly-ach; they are more heating to the whole of the &s;y&s;tem, and produce more copious evacuations. Of the&s;e the whole variety, as Turpentine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be u&s;ed. Turpentine, on account of its difficult diffu&s;ibility, is not very proper. The mo&s;t conve|nient, and perhaps the mo&s;t efficacious of all, is Gum Guaiac, which is found an u&s;eful Purgative in all ca&s;es of ob&s;tinate Co&s;|tivene&s;s, where there is no danger from its heating quality. We are apt to mi&s;s the effects of this in a &s;olid form, and therefore it &s;hould be well di&s;&s;olved in mucilage, or yolk of egg. With &s;ugar it is not &s;o effectual, depending more on the &s;olvent powers of diffe|rent &s;tomachs.</P>

<P>All the Purgatives in&s;erted in our Catalogue, after the title <HI>Anti&s;pa&s;modica,</HI> are,</P>
<P><HI>Acrid Purgatives,</HI> of which <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers &s;ay very little but what concerns their natural or chemical hi&s;tory. With regard to the fir&s;t, we have, in general, purpo&s;ely avoided it. Little has been obtained from the chemical hi&s;tory, nor is it yet determined in what &s;ub&s;tance the medicinal powers re&s;ide.

<P><HI>Rhubarh</HI> has, be&s;ides its purgative quality, an a&s;tringent one, and hence is peculiarly adapted to the dy&s;entery. It al&s;o has a bitterne&s;s joined to it.</P>

<HI>Senna.</HI> Whether there be any foundation for this being one of the mo&s;t frequently employed purgatives, I cannot &s;ay, nor have I been able to find it. It is as acrid and inflammatory as any. It ought to be infu&s;ed in a large proportion of water, which is preferable to decoction, in &s;o far as the purgative quality re&s;ides in a volatile part, which flies off by the treatment. This volatile part, obtained by the largely diluted infu&s;ion of Senna, is that who&s;e operation is mo&s;t gentle and ea&s;y. Juice of Lemons and Cream of Tartar correct the bitterne&s;s of our pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Helleborus niger</HI> is commonly placed among the mo&s;t acrid pur|gatives. It is to me a medicine of uncertain qualities. As employ|ing it in infu&s;ion or extract, I have been di&s;appointed of its effects as a purgative at all. It has al&s;o been recommended as a powerful emmenagogue by Dr. Mead, but I have never met with in&s;tances of its efficacy.</P>
<P>The five next are all &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus, the <HI>Convolvulus,</HI> and are exotics. Our common <HI>Convolvulus</HI> de&s;erves a trial, to &s;ee if it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ame virtues.</P>

<P><HI>Jalap</HI> is neither more violent in its effects, as a purgative, than Senna, nor is it &s;o griping. If any purgative be diuretic, this is remarkably &s;uch, when treated like Seneka by decoction, which di&s;&s;ipates its virulent acrimony.</P>
<P><HI>Scammony</HI> has been always placed among the acrid purgatives. Its ta&s;te is not very di&s;agreeable. It requires to be very well divided, is frequently adulterated; I imagine it has &s;omething of the nature of aloes.</P>
<P>The purgatives that follow are more acrid than tho&s;e we have mentioned, but none of them have any &s;pecific powers.</P>

It has been &s;ometimes em|ployed with advantage, and in other ca&s;es done harm. They u&s;ed it after wa&s;hing it from its acids; but in this &s;tate, though not &s;o|luble in watery fluids, yet it may, like other precipitated metals, be acted on by the weaker acids, as that of the &s;tomach. Hence its action would depend, in a great degree, on the quantity of acid pre|&s;ent there, and hence t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> are derived the various accounts of its effects. In general it acts as a purgative, &s;ometimes as a diaphoretic, and, like other metal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">c preparations, is al&s;o anthelm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ntic.

<P><HI>Silver.</HI> This metal is inactive in its metallic form, nor can it be rendered &s;aline by the acid of the &s;tomach, unle&s;s when precipitated from the nitrous Acid.

where a quick effect is de&s;ired, it does not &s;ucceed &s;o well, as it is delique&s;cent. It is u&s;eful as a &s;typtic, and may an&s;wer as a deter|gent. Internally it may be of &s;ervice, when the cry&s;tals are ren|dered milder, by extracting part of the acid. Lewis, in the New Di&s;pen&s;atory, has given the be&s;t directions for this. It has been employed chiefly as a Purgative. Boerhaave and Boyle recommend it much in hydropic ca&s;es, as evacuating the contents of the vi&s;|cera by &s;tool and urine with great ea&s;e, but a long u&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f it hurts their tone.

<HEAD>DIURETICA.</HEAD>
<P>The effect of Diuretics is very uncertain. Many medicines are enumerated as having a diuretic quality, but there is not one of them that exerts it always, nor any to a con&s;iderable degree. There is not a more powerful &s;timulus to the kidneys than the Cantharides, and yet even the effect of the&s;e in increa&s;ing urine, was not &s;teady, although at the &s;ame time I have &s;een them produce a &s;trangury. The failure of the Diuretics is probably owing to the diffu&s;ion which all the medicines pa&s;&s;ing through the ma&s;s of blood are liable to. We may be di&s;appointed in many &s;uppo&s;ed Diuretics from the medicines mentioned by <HI>Materia Medica</HI> writers relieving only di&s;ea&s;es of the kidneys. There is evidence of many A&s;tringents, be&s;ides the <HI>Uva Ur&s;i,</HI> being in the li&s;t of Diuretics. A Phy&s;ician wrote a Di&s;&s;ertation, pub|li&s;hed forty years ago, entitled, <HI>De Calculo per A&s;tringentia pellendo,</HI> and I do not doubt but A&s;tringents may &s;ometimes promote this eva|caution. I am told that Stock, in a late book, his <HI>Annus Me|di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> recommends &s;everal A&s;tringents, in ob&s;tinate ca&s;es of the <HI>Co|lica</HI>

<HI>Pictonum,</HI> which &s;ufficiently &s;hews the uncertainly of the ope|ration of any medicine.</P>
<P>The operation of Diuretics does not depend on their changing the con&s;i&s;tence of our fluids, and I have no doubt in &s;aying, that univer&s;ally they act either by a &s;timulus directly applied to the kid|neys, or to the parts con&s;enting with them. That the kidneys may be affected by con&s;ent, appears from their being a copious flow of limpid urine in hy&s;teric paroxy&s;ms, in the &s;ame manner as nephri|tic affections cau&s;e vomiting. It is from acting in the Inte&s;tines that purgatives, I imagine, exert their diuretic power, at lea&s;t it is very doubtful if it be not &s;o, &s;ince &s;tones in the kidneys cau&s;e Cholics. Commonly, and perhaps properly, the &s;timulus of Diure|tics is &s;uppo&s;ed of a &s;aline nature; but I would by no means confine it to this. Any Acrid will do, and there is Acrimony of an oily kind, and others with which we are not acquainted.</P>
<P>As to their general effects:</P>
<P N="1">1. They evacuate water from the blood-ve&s;&s;els, and by the eva|caution cau&s;ing an ab&s;orption, they draw out water accumulated in any quantity and &s;tagnating in the cavities. Hence they are &s;uppo&s;ed to cure Drop&s;y, but their &s;timulus is generally but gentle, and we &s;ucceed le&s;s often than we would wi&s;h or imagine.</P>
<P N="2">2. They evacuate with the water, the &s;aline, putre&s;cent parts of our blood, and hence all Diuretics are anti&s;corbutic; and the contrary.</P>
<P N="3">3. With the&s;e Diuretics wa&s;h out all the extraneous bodies in the &s;ero&s;ity. Hence they may be u&s;eful in evacuating every &s;ort of Acrimony.</P>
<P>If their operation were certain, this cla&s;s of medicines would be of infinite advantage; nay, they may often be &s;o without any &s;en&s;ible effect, for every Diuretic is a Diaphoretic. In order to ex|pede their operation, it is always proper to throw in much water,
<PB N="488" REF="014000_0494_0F928A3D17C61328">
which may run off by the &s;erous excretories. The only exception to this is the ca&s;e of Drop&s;y, but even here we are not certain. We have had lately an in&s;tance, in this place, of a woman labouring under an Ana&s;arca, and &s;eemingly an A&s;cites, which has re&s;i&s;ted every medicine, who, by drinking largely of a mineral water, brought on a great flow of water, and was relieved.

<HEAD>PARTICULAR DIURETICS.</HEAD>
<P>Of the vegetable Diuretics I have marked two natural orders.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Umbellatae,</HI> which have univer&s;ally a diuretic power a&s;cribed to them. Their effects are never very evident, although, like the Cicuta, they may be u&s;eful without the&s;e being &s;en&s;ible. I have &s;et down &s;uch as are mo&s;t employed, but cannot &s;ay how far the choice is accurate.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Stellatae.</HI> The whole of this cla&s;s are a&s;tringent, and it is to this property that their diuretic virtue, if ever they exert it, is, I imagine, to be imputed. Although the&s;e are the only natural orders particularized, yet under the title <HI>Stimulantia,</HI> referred to, will be found the <HI>Siliquo&s;ae, &amp;c.</HI> with which I might have encrea&s;ed the li&s;t, as every one of them is famous in this way.</P>
<P>What follow next are a <HI>Mi&s;cellaneous Set,</HI> put together from various &s;ources, upon very uncertain foundation, except with regard to a few.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;arum, Geni&s;ta,</HI> and <HI>Seneka,</HI> are mentioned, to &s;hew that all Emetics and Cathartics, by proper management, may be rendered diuretic. Thus Ipecacuan, by &s;trong coction, will lo&s;e its emetic, but re&s;erve a diuretic power.</P>
<P><HI>Ab&s;ynthium, Carduus, Ruta,</HI> &amp;c. are all, on many occa&s;ions, evi|dently diuretic, but without any preten&s;ions to &s;aline acrimony.</P>
<P>With regard to the re&s;t, hardly any particular marks need be made.</P>
<P><PB N="489" REF="014000_0495_0F928A3DB66362B8">
<HI>Dulcamara</HI> is a &s;pecies of Solanum, and of the nature of it and the other <HI>Luridae.</HI> Its berries are narcotic, which the leaves and bark are, in a le&s;s degree, with the addition of a purgative virtue. The woody parts are lea&s;t narcotic, &s;omewhat purgative, and more diuretic.

<P><HI>Saline Diuretics.</HI> The increa&s;e of urine is never very remarkable from the&s;e, except when the &s;alt is accompanied with a large quan|tity of water, to which the increa&s;e may be greatly imputed. The mo&s;t powerful of the Saline Diuretics is the Cau&s;tic Alkali properly diluted, and perhaps more effectual when joined to the Bitters, the virtues of the one mutually encrea&s;ing, and being encrea&s;ed by, the virtues of the other.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="type of medicine">
<HEAD>DIAPHORETICS.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e are properly of two kinds; 1. Tho&s;e &s;trictly &s;o called, which promote in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration only; 2. Tho&s;e which cau&s;e &s;weat. Of the Diaphoretics, &s;trictly &s;o called, as the effect is not evident to the &s;en&s;es, and &s;eldom tried by &s;tatical experiments, our knowledge is not accurate. We have only account of one by Sanc|torius, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> A&s;&s;a Foetida.</P>
<P>As to their general effects, they are analogous to tho&s;e of Di|uretics. Sudorifics act thus &s;en&s;ibly, and &s;o have been employed in Drop&s;y, but their u&s;e is uncertain, as the means employed to obtain their operation excite a fever, which is not always &s;afe. They e&s;pecially evacuate every putre&s;cent part of the blood, every acrimony generated there, and every extraneous matter. We are more certain of this operation, by making external a&s;&s;i&s;tants concur with our internal Diaphoretics. Here we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, as the action is more extended, that a more copious evacuation is made, and more convenient, as we can in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ecure it, when the&s;e means are not hurtful with regard to the di&s;ea&s;e we could cure. In the Scurvy, Sweating would be hurtful, and a Diaphore&s;is is only proper. In the <HI>Lues Venerea</HI> Sweating has peculiar advan|tages.
<PB N="490" REF="014000_0496_0F928A3E8000DAC0">
It can be kept up more &s;teadily than the evacuation by &s;tool, and more conveniently than &s;alivation, and if it could be excited with ea&s;e, is certainly the be&s;t method of cure. Sweat is the only excretion, which, independent of particular &s;timulus, merely follows the increa&s;e of circulation, which connection &s;eems to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by Nature, in order to obviate the effects which would ari&s;e from heat, motion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and hence Sweating might cure Fever, without having recour&s;e to the evacuation of any particular matter. Fever is always founded in a con&s;triction of the &s;urface of the body, and if this be granted, it is plain the relaxation of the con&s;triction may take it off. Hence there is no doubt but Sweating may cure Fever, but whether at all times it is proper, I will not &s;ay. It is alledged, that if we can bring out a Sweat in the beginning, we may obviate any Fever; but this needs confirmation, and I do not agree to it. Certain, however, it is, that the ca&s;e is often thus. Some are of opinion, that Sweating may be u&s;ed during the whole cour&s;e of a Fever, while others think it ought only to be employed in the beginning. This di&s;cu&s;&s;ion we cannot enter upon at pre&s;ent. To determine when and where they &s;hould be exhibited is very difficult, but it mu&s;t be admitted, that in many ca&s;es Sudorifics are u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Sudorific power and &s;udorific medicines are of different kinds. All general Stimulants of the &s;y&s;tem, as motion and heat, are power|ful Sudorifics. The la&s;t &s;eems to concur with the others I am to mention. Particular Stimulants may be of two kinds; 1. Tho&s;e which are applied to the excretories them&s;elves; 2. Tho&s;e applied to parts con&s;enting with them, as the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>In the next place, Sudorifics may be Anti&s;pa&s;modics. The&s;e are of two kinds; 1. The Sedative and Narcotic; 2. The Anti&s;pa&s;mo|dics, &s;trictly &s;o called. The fir&s;t relax the &s;maller, and give a &s;ti|mulus to the larger ve&s;&s;els. The &s;econd are &s;uch as we are not cer|tain by what power they act.</P>
<P>With regard to all of them, we had occa&s;ion to mention them before. We have only one thing to ob&s;erve. Stimulant Sudo|rifics
<PB N="491" REF="014000_0497_0F928A3F4CBF61C8">
are only to be employed as Evacuants, when there is no feveri&s;h Spa&s;m, except to obviate the Spa&s;m at a new acce&s;&s;ion, or when the anti&s;pa&s;modic virtue is in con&s;iderable proportion, becau&s;e febrile Spa&s;m is not to be overcome, but aggravated, by increa&s;ing the cir|culation. This e&s;pecially takes place with regard to inflammatory Spa&s;m. In order, therefore, to proceed &s;afely, we mu&s;t u&s;e Anti&s;|pa&s;modics. Whether or not the&s;e are &s;o with regard to inflammatory Spa&s;m, as is alledged of Camphire, I &s;hall not determine, but un|doubtedly this, Mu&s;k, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are u&s;eful in the feveri&s;h Spa&s;m, and where Nature points out a remi&s;&s;ion and acce&s;&s;ion, and then may &s;afely be employed.</P>

<HEAD>MENAGOGA.</HEAD>
<P>In concluding our la&s;t head, we were engaged in a difficult &s;ubject, and at pre&s;ent we enter upon one of the &s;ame nature, in the con&s;i|deration of Emmenagogues, for there is not an indication which we have le&s;s in our power. It differs in this from the other evacuations, that we never think of encrea&s;ing it above its natural quantity, or of applying medicines but to overcome its ob&s;truction. Hence, medicines on this head mu&s;t differ as the cau&s;e of ob&s;truction differs. 1. Nothing has been more common than to &s;uppo&s;e the men&s;trual flux depending on an univer&s;al plethora, &s;o that a defect of it mu&s;t depend on a defect of fluids, and whatever re&s;tores the plethora mu&s;t re&s;tore this. But in my opinion this cannot be the ca&s;e, for the flux often goes on &s;teadily and regularly where this defect of fluids in the &s;y&s;tem takes place. 2. A certain lentor and vi&s;cidity of the blood has been reckoned a cau&s;e of the men&s;trual flux. Again&s;t this I would alledge, that the pre&s;ence of &s;uch an actual lentor has never been proved, and although it had, it is very unlikely that it &s;hould ever affect the lax dilatable &s;y&s;tem of uterine ve&s;&s;els. 3. With more probability has a defect of motion been blamed, as it is often apt to occur in the weak, as in the ca&s;e of Chloro&s;is, and where there is a weak &s;y&s;tem of the uterus. But &s;till there is an uncertainty here, and it is doubtful of the weakne&s;s and ob&s;truction, whether it is cau&s;e or effect. To remove the di&s;ea&s;e, however, it is nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="492" REF="014000_0498_0F928959130AF448">
remove the flaccidity. 4. But the mo&s;t obvious cau&s;e is the con|&s;triction of the extreme ve&s;&s;els, the <HI>contractio va&s;i propria aucta,</HI> which is often produced by cold, pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for &s;up|po&s;e we &s;hould admit the weaker impetus, it could not have the ef|fect, unle&s;s as it gives an opportunity for a &s;trong &s;tricture in the ex|tremities. Hence Menagogues may be con&s;idered as of three kinds.</P>
<P N="1">1. A&s;tringents, in &s;o far as they can be employed to re&s;tore the tone of the &s;y&s;tem, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;uch as produced a con&s;triction, which does not go &s;o far as a &s;pa&s;modic affection, but increa&s;es the impetus of the &s;y&s;tem. Almo&s;t all of the&s;e have been, at different times, em|ployed. I have only &s;et down Iron as mo&s;t commonly in u&s;e. Pro|bably, by introducing it in &s;mall quantities, and at intervals, it might be made to act as a tonic. The a&s;tringent Bitters, as the Bark, might be employed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Menagogues may be Stimulants, of which there are of diffe|rent kinds. 1. Such as act on the &s;y&s;tem more generally, and only indirectly increa&s;e the impetus of the blood in the uterus, as exter|nally the Cold Bath, and internally Mercury, which produces bri&s;ker o&s;cillations in the extreme ve&s;&s;els of the whole &s;y&s;tem. 2. Stimulants may be &s;uch as act on the uterus it&s;elf. The&s;e have been &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch as act &s;pecifically upon the uterus. Specific &s;ti|muli to the &s;ecretions can be explained, by &s;uppo&s;ing an affinity be|tween the medicine and the fluid to be &s;ecreted, but &s;uch explication cannot be given here; and I would alledge, that no &s;pecific &s;timuli of the uterus are yet &s;hewn, and that the direct &s;timulants of the uterus are only the external. There is no doubt but application might be made to the uterus by way of fotus, but this is not &s;o convenient, and could only be in common to it with the whole lower belly. In|jection into the vagina has been propo&s;ed, but this can &s;eldom be ad|mitted; ca&s;es, however, have been alledged of its &s;ucce&s;s. The injec|tion of the &s;moke of tobacco has been propo&s;ed, and I make no doubt of the exertion of its &s;timulus: Such medicines al&s;o as aloes and the foetid gums (of which, tho' difficult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ain, the virtue in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;eems to be proved, of a &s;pecific power of encrea&s;ing hae|morrhagy,)
<PB N="493" REF="014000_0499_0F928959B3917638">
may be employed. 3. There is another way &s;till of u&s;ing Stimulants, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by determining the blood in greater quantity to the de&s;cending aorta and its branches, and &s;o to the uterus. Such is the application of warm water to the extremities, and opening the veins of the foot, which la&s;t is an evacuation certainly of little con|&s;equence in encrea&s;ing the impetus indirectly, and is not &s;en&s;ible on a calculation. Purging is a more effectual determination, as the &s;timulus &s;ub&s;i&s;ts &s;ome time, as the evacuation that way may be greater than any other, and as the &s;timulus even may be communi|cated from the con&s;ent between the womb and alimentary canal: Hence acrid purgatives are often effectual Menagogues. The &s;ame thing is effected by &s;uch medicines as have a particular power of &s;timulating the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, as Cantharides, which excite the venereal appetite, which cannot be done without a con&s;iderable de|termination of the blood to the genital parts, and to the uterus in particular. On this account I doubt not but that &s;uch, if they could be &s;afely employed, would prove menagogue.</P>
<P N="3">3. Anti&s;pa&s;modics may be menagogue, as the di&s;ea&s;e is founded in &s;pa&s;modic con&s;triction. Tho&s;e of the foetid kind are &s;uppo&s;ed to be peculiarly appropriated, but the others would an&s;wer equally well, if we had the proper method of applying them, which, as there is a continued &s;pa&s;m, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e might be done at all times; but, on repeated experience, I have found they are only u&s;eful in the time of the men&s;trual period.</P>
<P>None of the medicines proper for the removal of the men&s;trual ob&s;truction can be employed at all times, and when the period is not near at hand, except the A&s;tringents and Mercury; but it is only at the return of the men&s;trual period, where there is an aggra|vation of the &s;ymptoms, and an effort of nature, that the Stimu|lants, and more e&s;pecially the Anti&s;pa&s;modics, can be effectual. I have no doubt that mu&s;k may be a powerful remedy, when given at the time of the paroxy&s;m, or aggravation. Ca&s;tor is &s;et down as a general title for the foetid Anti&s;pa&s;modics. Crocus is very &s;eldom to be depended upon.</P>
