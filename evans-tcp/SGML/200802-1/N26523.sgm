<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Philadelphia Medical Society,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO embalm, by offerings of tributary monuments, the memory of the wi&s;e, the valiant, the good, and the great, is a cu&s;tom co-eval with the hi&s;tory of man. Nor is this cu&s;tom le&s;s honourable and prai&s;e-worthy, from its nature, than venerable, from the cir|cum&s;tance of its high antiquity. Whether we view it, in its relation&s;hip to the cultivation of private virtues, or to the promotion of public good, its objects are highly intere&s;ting and important. They are, to fan in our brea&s;ts the flame of friend&s;hips threatened with extinction by the damps of death, to add perpetuity to &s;entiments of gratitude for di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervices, to cheri&s;h in our bo&s;oms a love of exalted worth, and to allure us on to virtuous conduct, through the me|dium of our con&s;titutional propen&s;ity to imitation, and by the powerful motives of emulation and the love of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>For the&s;e purpo&s;es have the rude but energetic &s;ongs of the bards and min&s;trels, of old, re&s;ound|ed&mdash;for the&s;e purpo&s;es have temples and other archi|tectural monuments been erected in honour of de|parted heroes&mdash;for the&s;e purpo&s;es has the chi&s;&s;el of the &s;kilful &s;tatuary been plied&mdash;for the&s;e purpo&s;es has
<PB N="4" REF="035262_0004_1001B3785059CA80">
the pencil of the painter been exerci&s;ed&mdash;for the&s;e purpo&s;es have the pens of the hi&s;torian and biogra|pher been employed&mdash;and, for the&s;e purpo&s;es has the voice of the eulogi&s;t been heard&mdash;Allow me to add, for the&s;e purpo&s;es have we a&s;&s;embled on the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting, but mournful, occa&s;ion!&mdash;</P>
<P>Death, my fellow members, has, not long &s;ince, in|vaded our in&s;titution, and &s;wept off one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of our colleagues!&mdash;The name of Coop|er is &s;till alike dear and familiar to mo&s;t of you, though he, who bore that name, has &s;unk, with all his virtues, to an untimely grave!&mdash;But I renounce the unfounded thought, and retract the unwelcome and injurious a&s;&s;ertion!&mdash;Though our ine&s;timable col|league has him&s;elf, di&s;appeared, it is not &s;o with his numerous virtues! They &s;till remain, a guardian con|&s;tellation&mdash;a glittering galaxy, to light his &s;urviving friends, on the dark and intricate journey of life!&mdash; Thus were the pious &s;ages of the ea&s;t, originally appri&s;ed of the birth of the Me&s;&s;iah, and afterwards conducted on their way to do him homage, by a bright and &s;upernumerary &s;tar in the heavens!&mdash; Though &s;natched away by a &s;udden and unexpected &s;troke, this amiable young philo&s;opher has not left us without a fair and authentic te&s;timonial of his affec|tion and regard! We have even become his heirs&mdash; He has bounteou&s;ly bequeathed to us his character and example&mdash;a legacy, as far &s;uperior to the ordina|ry beque&s;ts of men, as moral excellence &s;urpa&s;&s;es the value of peri&s;hable matter; or, as the beauty of intel|lect &s;urpa&s;&s;es the beauty of material objects! Mine is the melancholy, yet not unwelcome ta&s;k, to examine
<PB N="5" REF="035262_0005_1001B37B601BA678">
well the contents of this legacy; to endeavour to appreciate each &s;eparate article of the trea&s;ure it em|braces, and exhibit a detailed &s;tatement of the whole, that you may, then, with the more facility, arrive at an e&s;timate of its real worth&mdash;To drop the language of metaphor, I am called on, by your &s;uffrages, to &s;peak what I know, re&s;pecting the general character of our decea&s;ed friend.</P>
<P>As the field, on which I am about to enter, abounds with the choice&s;t flowers and fruits of intellect and morality, you will pardon me &s;hould I leave it with much reluctance. But it is not more rich and beauti|ful, than exten&s;ive and capacious. For though our friend and colleague did not, in age, complete his twenty-&s;eventh year, in &s;cientific acquirements, in rec|titude of principle, and in acts of benevolence and virtue, he had already attained an advanced longevi|ty. Let my reluctance, then, to lo&s;e &s;ight of a pro&s;|pect &s;o fair and enchanting, as that exhibited by the character of the gentleman, who&s;e worth we com|memorate, be received as an apology, for any unin|tentional tre&s;pa&s;s I may commit on your patience.</P>
<P>In your late re&s;olution to perpetuate, by an eulogi|um, the memory of Dr. Cooper, you have done e|qual honour to me, to your&s;elves, to genius, to &s;ci|ence, to morality, to religion, and to the healing art.</P>
<P>You have done honour to me, by the appointment which your flattering partiality has a&s;&s;igned me: you have done honour to your&s;elves, by avowing your un|alterable attachment to di&s;tingui&s;hed excellence: you
<PB N="6" REF="035262_0006_1001AE0248F8BCD8">
have done honour to genius, by an attempt to pre|&s;erve from the &s;hades of oblivion, one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon &s;hare of this fir&s;t of endowments: you have done honour to &s;cience, by paying due re&s;pect to the memory of one, who would &s;hortly have been ranked among its brighte&s;t ornaments: you have done honour to morality, by doing homage to a cha|racter formed on the ba&s;is of its pure&s;t principles: you have done honour to religion, by a re&s;pectful tribute to the worth of a young philo&s;opher, whose life was a &s;eries of conduct conformable to its pre|cepts: and you have done honour to the healing art, by making honourable and worthy mention of one, who had &s;pent many toil&s;ome years in its cultivation, and who&s;e talents and indu&s;try would have rai&s;ed him, in time, to a level with the mo&s;t exalted medi|cal characters of the age.</P>
<P>Dr. Cooper was a native of the &s;tate of Maryland. He was born in Talbot county, on the Ea&s;tern Shore, on the 8th of September, 1772. Amid the fields and fore&s;ts, in the neighbourhood of this place, did he imbibe, from early ob&s;ervation, the rudiments of that knowledge of nature, which he afterwards cultivated with &s;uch indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s. Though him&s;elf the only &s;urviving individual of his family, he, notwith|&s;tanding, retained and exhibited, through the whole of his life, the mo&s;t re&s;pectful and affectionate attach|ment to the place of his birth, being al&s;o the place where the relics of his forefathers and kin&s;men were depo&s;ited. Re&s;pecting the parentage of our de|cea&s;ed colleague, my knowledge is extremely limited and defective. As his pre-eminent mode&s;ty kept him
<PB N="7" REF="035262_0007_1001B3861B7ED180">
for ever &s;ilent on &s;ubjects that bore relation to him|&s;elf, I never, during the whole of our acquaintance, received from him, a &s;ingle article of information re|&s;pecting his de&s;cent and family connections. I well know, however, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither the right nor the inclination, to avail him&s;elf of that mo&s;t empty and unmeaning of all boa&s;ts, a long and &s;plendid line of ance&s;try. As far as I have been able to learn, his parents were remarkable for nothing except their ho|ne&s;ty, their indu&s;try, and the general decorum and rectitude of their conduct. No uncommon blaze of parental genius, no glitterring pomp of accidental riches, no towering pride of family alliances, no lengthened catalogue of ance&s;tral greatne&s;s, contri|buted to add an artificial lu&s;tre to the birth of our young philo&s;opher. Like the fair &s;tar of the morning, &s;pringing from the bo&s;om of the darke&s;t hour, he ro&s;e to what he was, from the lap of ob&s;curity. Nor let the <HI>haughty</HI> and the high-born, tho&s;e &s;laves to con&s;pi|cuous de&s;cent, and titled greatne&s;s, con&s;ider his re|&s;pectability and merit as dimini&s;hed by this&mdash;Let &s;uch remember, that to the humble valley, no le&s;s than to the cloud-capt mountain, are many of our mo&s;t beau|teous and maje&s;tic &s;treams indebted for their origin. Who, in gazing on the brilliancy of the diamond, can &s;uffer the darkne&s;s of the matrix, where its beau|ties were matured, to throw, in imagination, an en|vious &s;hadow over its lu&s;tre?&mdash;Or who, on &s;urveying the maje&s;ty of the oak, that exults in its &s;trength, and towers aloft, the glory of the fore&s;t, can con&s;ider its grandeur as, in any mea&s;ure, dimini&s;hed by the &s;mall|ne&s;s of the acorn from which it &s;prang?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035262_0008_1001B38C44B49318">As my acquaintance with our fellow-member, who&s;e worth we commemorate, did not commence till his arrival at manhood, I am di&s;qualified for being a minute biographer of his earlier years. I am una|ble to a&s;cend, hi&s;torically, to the period of his infan|cy, when his ob&s;ervation was gradually awakening to the beauties, the harmonies, and the contra&s;ts of na|ture. I will not undertake to portray to you, from po&s;itive anecdote, the impre&s;&s;ive wonder with which he, at fir&s;t, viewed the general fabric of vi&s;ible crea|ation&mdash;the delight he derived from an immediate ex|amination of &s;urrounding bodies&mdash;nor the &s;ilent rap|ture, with which he &s;urveyed the di&s;tant expan&s;e of the &s;tarry heavens! His &s;en&s;ations, when fir&s;t intro|duced to an interview with the more bold and &s;ublime &s;cenes of nature&mdash;when the heavens were involved in a dark and tumultuous covering of clouds&mdash;when all nature &s;eemed immer&s;ed in a depth of expectation and &s;olicitude, on account of the impending elementary convul&s;ion&mdash;when, at length, the fierce lightning be|gan to dart, in all directions, its dreadful coru&s;cations, and the mingled roar of tempe&s;t and of thunder to be, every moment, reiterated in his ears&mdash;the &s;en&s;ations, I &s;ay, of our young philo&s;opher, on &s;uch an intere&s;t|ing occa&s;ion as this, con&s;titute a &s;ubject of which it is not my de&s;ign to attempt a de&s;cription. Allow me, however, to ob&s;erve, that they mu&s;t have been &s;uch, as could be experienced only, by a young mind of &s;uperior &s;trength and con&s;ummate &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;a mind exqui&s;itely formed for the enjoyment of that plea&s;ure, ari&s;ing from the contemplation of objects of grandeur and &s;ublimity. I can, at lea&s;t, very confidently a&s;|&s;ert,
<PB N="9" REF="035262_0009_1001B390DF285568">
that, when arrived at manhood. Dr. Cooper po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mind peculiarly adapted to the enjoyment of this &s;uperior de&s;cription of plea&s;ure&mdash;a mind, form|ed to li&s;ten, with that of the min&s;trel of Beattie, <Q>with plea&s;ing dread, to the deep roar of the wide-weltering waves;</Q> or, with that of Shake&s;pear, to exult in the whirlwind, and enjoy the &s;torm!</P>
<P>The progre&s;s, which our decea&s;ed friend made, in the cultivation and evolution of his intellectual pow|ers, are points, which I will, in like manner, pa&s;s over in &s;ilence. I will not attempt to trace the ex|pan&s;ion of his mind through all its infinitude of gra|dations from his early infancy, when it was but little &mdash;perhaps, I might even &s;ay, nothing more than a &s;en&s;itive germ, till that period of maturity in which it became capable of the mo&s;t glowing conception, and the mo&s;t powerful exertion of philo&s;ophic thought. In vain would I attempt to point to the time, when his opening imagination commenced its &s;portive ex|cur&s;ions, to collect materials for its future &s;cenes of mimic creation&mdash;and, in vain, to the time, when his under&s;tanding began to di&s;cern and di&s;criminate, and his rea&s;on to unravel, by degrees, its &s;lender and in|tricate thread of induction. The&s;e are themes of refinement, which I am obliged to re&s;ign to a better informed, a more metaphy&s;ical, and more de&s;criptive pen.</P>
<P>The particulars of Dr. Cooper's early &s;chola&s;tic education, in the country, are wholly unknown to me. Being unacquainted with him&s;elf, at this intere&s;t|ing period of life, and having, &s;ince, had no know|ledge
<PB N="10" REF="035262_0010_1001B39701FA9398">
of any of his teachers, patrons, or &s;chool-fel|lows, I am con&s;trained to leave a blank in this part of his biography. If we may judge, however, of his cha|racter, as a &s;tudent, at this, from that which he bore at a &s;ub&s;equent period, he was equally di&s;tingui&s;hed for the inten&s;ity of his application to &s;tudy, the amiability of his manners, the decorum of his general deportment, and the accuracy and rapidity of his literary acquire|ments. It may not be ami&s;s, however, to ob&s;erve, that there, not unfrequently, exi&s;ts between the early and &s;ub&s;equent periods of the lives of illu&s;trious cha|racters, the mo&s;t &s;triking di&s;&s;imilitude both with re|gard to their habits of &s;tudy, and the evidences of talents which they exhibit to the world. Thus, even the celebrated Dean Swift was once con&s;idered by his &s;chool-fellows and teachers, as an incorrigible block|head; the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tupidity of the great Newton him&s;elf, the illu&s;trious father of a&s;tronomic philo&s;o|phy, procured for him, on fir&s;t entering the univer&s;i|ty, the nick-name of "The Calf;" and the afterwards laborious and learned Gibbon, was pointed at, in the earlier part of his life, as a perfect paragon of idle|ne&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>When of feeble and tender age, and wholly inade|quate to the ta&s;k of &s;elf-direction, young Cooper had the misfortune to be deprived of both his parents. On the occurrence of this event, our minor was in|tru&s;ted to the guardian&s;hip of Mr. John Needles, a gentleman, who&s;e name alone, con&s;titutes the only article in his hi&s;tory, re&s;pecting which I po&s;&s;e&s;s any in|formation. Thus circum&s;tanced, before precept and example had fully formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed his princi|ples
<PB N="11" REF="035262_0011_1001B39A14381DF0">
of conduct&mdash;before ob&s;ervation and experience had furni&s;hed him with knowledge, or rea&s;on had lighted up her lamp for the direction of his &s;teps, the &s;ituation of our young friend was critical and perilous. Suddenly ca&s;t on the fathomle&s;s and tur|bulent ocean of life, with the &s;yren-voice of di&s;&s;ipa|tion and plea&s;ure, for ever melodiou&s;ly vibrating in his ear, and no venerable Mentor to conduct him, in &s;afety, to the wi&s;hed-for Utica of virtue, dark and du|bious, at be&s;t, were his pro&s;pects of future celebrity and happine&s;s! But no &s;ituation, however perilous and unfavourable, in appearance, can ju&s;tify our &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to a &s;pirit of de&s;pondency. Fortune is ever changeful, and may, in the cea&s;ele&s;s revolution of events, give birth to &s;omething unexpectedly au&s;pici|ous. Such was her conduct to our young philo&s;o|pher. Though &s;he appeared to frown, malignantly, on his earlier years, &s;he favoured him with her &s;miles, at a &s;ub&s;equent period. In his pa&s;&s;age through life, he acquired, by the mildne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, the at|tractive gentlene&s;s and mode&s;ty of his manners, and the general rectitude of his deportment, friends and patrons, who&s;e conver&s;ation and advice, &s;upplied, in a great mea&s;ure, the want of parental admonition and example.</P>
<P>In the year eighty-&s;ix, being, then, in the fourteenth year of his age, young Cooper was removed, by his guardian, to Philadelphia, for the purpo&s;e of complet|ing his cla&s;&s;ical education. Here he had the good for|tune to be placed under the au&s;pices of a chartered &s;chola&s;tic in&s;titution, the mo&s;t ancient of the kind in the &s;tate, yet not more venerable, from its age, than
<PB N="12" REF="035262_0012_1001AE20EEDA8990">
re&s;pectable, from its good government and exten&s;ive utility. I allude to the Friends' public grammar &s;chool, taught, at that time, by Mr. Robert Proud, a gentleman, who&s;e qualifications, as a teacher, can receive no additional re&s;pectability or lu&s;tre, by any thing that can re&s;ult from the efforts of my pen. Mr. Proud is a character, who&s;e unaccommodating &s;incerity and attachment to truth, are well known to prevent him alike from cen&s;uring unju&s;tly the faults of his enemies, or be&s;towing unmerited prai&s;es on the excellencies of his friends. Nor is he, perhaps, &s;econd to any one, in his powers for the di&s;covery of youthful merit. To acquire the particular friend&s;hip of &s;uch a teacher, and to be &s;poken of by him in terms of the highe&s;t applau&s;e, mu&s;t be alike grateful to the feelings of a pupil, and evidential of his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uperior worth. Such a pledge was it the good fortune of our colleague to receive and retain. Mr. Proud was his inalterable friend when living&mdash; He faithfully watched and recorded, in his memory, his numerous virtues as they opened, and does not cea&s;e to dwell on them now, as a ju&s;t and grateful tri|bute to his memory when dead.</P>
<P>Dr. Cooper continued a pupil in the grammar &s;chool, in Philadelphia, till &s;ome time in the autumn of the year ninety. During this period he was equal|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed for his &s;tudious habits, his decorum of behaviour, and the ea&s;e and rapidity of his advance|ment in the various branches of &s;chola&s;tic literature. Be&s;ides the acqui&s;ition of a very liberal acquaintance with geography, mathematics, hi&s;tory, and natural philo&s;ophy, he became &s;o perfectly ma&s;ter of the La|tin,
<PB N="13" REF="035262_0013_1001B3A65B4C0D68">
French, and Greek languages (particularly of the two former) as to write and conver&s;e in them with elegance and ea&s;e. I believe I am correct in a&s;&s;erting, that, in point of &s;chola&s;tic and philo&s;ophical acquirements, he &s;tood alone, the pride, the boa&s;t (I had almo&s;t &s;aid) the idol, of the in&s;titution!</P>
<P>But the re&s;ources of his genius were, by no means, expended on the &s;tudy of the cla&s;&s;ics. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an imagination towering, active, fertile, and creative&mdash; an imagination bright and fervid as a &s;un-beam, and co|exten&s;ive in its range with the land-marks of creation, his mind was not to be impri&s;oned in the narrow cloi&s;ter of &s;chola&s;tic learning. With a native and &s;trong predi|lection for works of fancy, he faithfully devoted his hours of amu&s;ement to the cultivation of an intimate ac|quaintance with the writings of the poets. No puerile attachment to giddy and unmeaning &s;ports&mdash;no di&s;lo|cated propen&s;ity to the idle amu&s;ements and di&s;&s;ipation of the times&mdash;no criminal pur&s;uit of forbidden plea|&s;ures, ever diverted his attention from its favourite channel. In&s;tead of dexterou&s;ly &s;pinning the well-poi&s;ed top, or following, with his eye, the poli&s;hed marble rolling along the pavements of our &s;treets, he cho&s;e to pur&s;ue, with the illu&s;trious Newton, the hea|venly bodies revolving on high, in their &s;pacious or|bits. In&s;tead of con&s;uming his hours in the lap of apathy and idlene&s;s&mdash;in&s;tead of participating, with a circle of di&s;&s;olute companions, in &s;hameful and peril|ous &s;cenes of immorality and vice, he cho&s;e to &s;oar, with his beloved Milton, through the haunts of angels, to the throne of the Deity&mdash;to de&s;cend, in imagina|tion, to the infernal regions, and &s;urvey the glooms,
<PB N="14" REF="035262_0014_1001B3AAF54BB8F8">
the torments, and the horrors of the place, in compa|ny with Homer, Virgil, and Fenelon&mdash;or to unravel the mazes of the nature and character of man, with Horace, Juvenal, Shake&s;pear, and Pope. But his amu&s;ements did not con&s;i&s;t &s;olely in traver&s;ing the &s;u|perior regions of poetry; he would oftentimes, in his more gay and &s;portive moments, de&s;cend to li&s;ten to the &s;hrill and piercing notes of the harp of Gray&mdash;to enjoy the melody of the tuneful Waller's lute&mdash;to dwell enraptured on the voice of the mu&s;e of Thom|&s;on&mdash;or &s;tray enchanted through the fairy regions of the de&s;criptive Spencer!</P>
<P>Such were the elegant and rational amu&s;ements, which occupied, during the earlier part of his life, the lei&s;ure hours of him who&s;e virtues we have met to commemorate. But he did not remain &s;atisfied with cultivating, and regaling his ta&s;te for the poetical beauties contained in the writings of others. Such an end was, by far, too groveling for his literary am|bition. Nor was that ambition de&s;titute of the aid of talents, fully adequate to its gratification. Born with a genius almo&s;t equally competent to every &s;pe|cies of literary exertion, he, not unfrequently, indulg|ed his imagination in the mo&s;t cha&s;te and elegant ef|fu&s;ions of poetry. Many of the&s;e productions, of our young bard and philo&s;opher, were publi&s;hed, under fictitious names, in the different prints of the city, and were &s;ought after, with avidity, by readers of ta&s;te.

While others, of his age, were engaged in pur&s;uit of evane&s;cent plea&s;ures, in parties, at balls, at concerts, or at the theatre, he, in his clo&s;et, &s;ur|rounded by the writings of poets, philo&s;ophers, and &s;ages, and zealous in the inve&s;tigation of &s;ome favour|ite &s;ubject, was in the actual enjoyment of that more rational and permanent plea&s;ure, ari&s;ing from the con|templation of truth, and the cultivation of the &s;everal powers of the mind.

<P>The mind of Dr. Cooper, as far as relates to the hi&s;tory of its phy&s;ical powers, would appear to have involved, in its con&s;titution, little le&s;s than an ab&s;olute contradiction. Among its a&s;&s;emblage of brilliant and valuable qualities, it embraced &s;uch as have been ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed to be ho&s;tile and incompatible. While it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in an eminent degree, the properties of the world-de&s;crying tele&s;cope, it was, by no means, a &s;tranger to tho&s;e of the micro&s;cope. While it &s;hone a Her&s;chel, in its capacious range, and boundle&s;s comprehen&s;ion, it was, no le&s;s, a Leewenhoek, in its painful and accurate examination of the minutiae of matter. Exqui&s;ite in its &s;en&s;ibility, and nice in its perception, no phy&s;ical object, however incon&s;idera|ble, could be pre&s;ented, nor any phenomenon occur, without giving ri&s;e to an appropriate impre&s;&s;ion, or exciting a corre&s;ponding exerci&s;e of thought. Like the well-poi&s;ed needle, tremblingly alive to the at|tractions

of the pole, his mind appeared to po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;titutional bent and affinity to truth. Nor was this affinity under the government of quantity, &s;o much as of quality. It was called into action by truths the mo&s;t minute, no le&s;s than by tho&s;e of &s;u|perior magnitude.</P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved that Dr. Cooper's ima|gination was &s;o enterprizing and powerful, as, occa&s;i|onally, to accompany his mu&s;e in the loftie&s;t flights. It might be &s;aid, like the poet's eye, to range "from heaven to earth and from earth to heaven," collect|ing every thing fair and valuable in its way. But it was not left to its own wild, de&s;ultory excur&s;ions, like a tempe&s;t-driven ve&s;&s;el, without a pilot and with|out a helm. It was ever reined in, and governed, by a &s;olid and luminous under&s;tanding, and corrected by the mo&s;t delicate and accurate ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Nor was his capacity for rea&s;oning at all inferior to his other intellectual powers. For ever tracing, with nice di&s;cernment, and uncommon facility, the exi&s;t|ing relations and connections between propo&s;itions or things, it &s;eldom failed to conduct him to fair and happy conclu&s;ions. In rea&s;oning, what was to others toil&s;ome and fatiguing, appeared, with him, but plea|&s;ure and amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>His memory was a capacious and faithful repo&s;itory of facts, opinions, and principles. It was fed through the avenues of all his &s;en&s;es, for each &s;en&s;e was ren|dered &s;ub&s;ervient to the information of his mind. So comprehen&s;ive was it as to admit every thing intere&s;t|ing
<PB N="19" REF="035262_0019_1001B3CB743F03E8">
from whatever quarter, and &s;o faithfully tenacious, as &s;eldom or never to lo&s;e a u&s;eful fact or truth, by which it had, once, been duly impre&s;&s;ed. In a word, his ob&s;ervation and indu&s;try had collected, and his memory gave reception to, an inconceivable volume of materials, to be arranged, &s;y&s;temized, and con|verted to their proper purpo&s;es, by the other kindred powers of his mind.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;uperlatively eminent, in its expan&s;ion and vi|gor, and nicely balanced, in all its powers, the mind of Dr. Cooper was to be re&s;pected as the dwelling-place of genius. This divine endowment does not appear to con&s;i&s;t, as has been &s;u&s;pected by &s;ome, in an additional or &s;upernumerary faculty of the mind, to be denominated, a &s;en&s;e of truth, and repre&s;enting, in miniature, the immediate intuition of the Deity. Such velocity is there, however, in the movements of genius&mdash;with &s;uch rapidity and ea&s;e does it bound from truth to truth, and from principle to principle, mo&s;t perfectly comprehending each, yet dwelling long on none, that the exi&s;tence of &s;uch an opinion is, by no means, extraordinary. This fir&s;t gift of heaven would &s;eem to be the re&s;ult of an exqui&s;ite degree of mental &s;en&s;ibility, a talent for exten&s;ive, rapid, and accurate ob&s;ervation; a capacious and retentive mem|ory; a lively, &s;trong, and enterprizing imagination; a clear and profound under&s;tanding; and vigorous and active powers of rea&s;on, all nicely balanced, and reciprocally aiding each other in the di&s;covery of truth.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="035262_0020_1001B3D1976165B8">By the balance of the mental powers, I mean, that they &s;hould all be equal in point of &s;trength and per|fection, the one not characterized by exce&s;s, nor the others by deficiency. Like the different parts of a well-fini&s;hed edifice, they &s;hould &s;upport, &s;trengthen, and ornament each other. Thus, the man, who&s;e mind is nothing but an entire blaze of imagination, can, by no means, be &s;aid to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of genius&punc; Nor can he, who&s;e imagination is weak, or phlegma|tically dull, though his other powers be of the mo&s;t exalted grade.

The man of real ge|nius po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a mind that can, at once, feel, perceive, ob&s;erve, retain, di&s;tingui&s;h, &s;oar, and combine, and that can perform all the&s;e functions, in a manner the mo&s;t perfect&mdash;Though &s;uch a mind mu&s;t be e&s;teemed a phoenix, no le&s;s in rarity than in beauty and excel|lence; yet &s;uch was the mind of our departed col|league!</P>
<P>Beneath the au&s;pices, and amid the numerous lite|raty advantages of Philadelphia, the intellect of our young friend di&s;clo&s;ed its re&s;ources, with a rapidity, and acquired, finally, a degree of expan&s;ion, &s;trength, and activity, to which, under circum&s;tances, le&s;s fa|vourable, it could never have attained. Had it been &s;uffered to remain &s;eque&s;tered, in a di&s;tant and ob|&s;cure part of the country, where the orb of &s;cience &s;heds, at be&s;t, but a faint and &s;ickly gleam, its pow|ers might have lain for ever dormant and undi&s;cover|ed

Thus lies the marble, a crude and &s;hapele&s;s ma&s;s, till, touched by the magic chi&s;&s;el of the &s;tatuary, it &s;prings erect, with the beauty and ele|gance of the human form. And, thus, beneath the raging of the wintry elements, lies, cold and torpid, the vegetable embryo, till, awakened into life by the voice of &s;pring, it expands its tender leaves and flow|ers, a harbinger and pledge of its impending fertility!</P>
<P>In the autumn of the year ninety, young Cooper left the grammar &s;chool in this city, by the direction of his guardian, and returned to Maryland, with a view to engage in the &s;tudy of a profe&s;&s;ion. His lo&s;s was much and &s;incerely regretted, by a very re&s;pecta|ble acquaintance, who followed him, to his retreat in the country, with the mo&s;t cordial expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and affection. Nor was this an occurrence at all unexpected. For &s;uch was his general charac|ter and deportment, that to know, and admire him, were events in&s;eparably and nece&s;&s;arily connected.</P>
<P>Sometime in the year ninety-one, he entered on his medical &s;tudies, in his native &s;tate, under the direc|tion of Dr. Martin, a gentleman who&s;e e&s;teem and confidence he very &s;oon acquired, and of whom I have always heard him &s;peak in terms the mo&s;t re|&s;pectful. In ninety-two he returned to Philadelphia, on an invitation from the managers of the Penn&s;ylvania
<PB N="22" REF="035262_0022_1001B3DF5EBC6C68">
ho&s;pital, and, on the 28th of Augu&s;t, in the &s;ame year, entered as an apprentice to that celebrated, and benevolent in&s;titution&mdash;an in&s;titution, which reflects equal honour on its original founders, and on tho&s;e, who, at the pre&s;ent day, conduct it with &s;uch con|&s;ummate wi&s;dom and fidelity!</P>
<P>Here our young friend found him&s;elf in a &s;ituation admirably calculated to exerci&s;e, and rear to full ma|turity, every bright and amiable quality of his mind. The ancient and venerable man&s;ion, where he re&s;ided, enclo&s;ed by a ma&s;&s;y wall, and over&s;hadowed by lofty trees, prepared, in appearance, to bid defiance to the &s;hock of ages, impre&s;&s;ed his mind with &s;en&s;ations of &s;olemnity, favourable to the contemplation and recep|tion of the truths of nature. Nor were the be&s;t &s;ources wanting for the &s;upply of &s;uch truths. Fur|ni&s;hed with a large and choice collection of books, on every branch of phy&s;ical &s;cience, immer&s;ed in walks well &s;uited for the purpo&s;es of ob&s;ervation and reflec|tion, and &s;urrounded by numerous objects of di&s;tre&s;s, claiming equally his attention and &s;kill as a phy&s;ician, and philo&s;opher, and his &s;ympathy and &s;oothing ten|derne&s;s, as a man; he found ample &s;cope for the ex|erci&s;e of all his intellect and benevolence. Nor did he &s;uffer either the powers of his head, or the virtues of his heart, to contract the cankering ru&s;t of indo|lence. Ever bu&s;ied in pur&s;uits of &s;cience, of litera|ture, or of humanity, his life was a perpetual circle of action. Except during his hours of repo&s;e, which were but few, and when engaged in familiar inter|cour&s;e with his friends, his mind was but &s;eldom in|dulged in the luxury of relaxation. To him the a|mu&s;ements
<PB N="23" REF="035262_0023_1001B3E708637600">
of the city pre&s;ented no attractions. Su|premely intent on acquiring knowledge, and on doing good, he found no time to be&s;tow on &s;uch u&s;ele&s;s en|gagements. His bu&s;ine&s;s way &s;tudy, his plea&s;ure re|&s;ulted from the alleviation of human mi&s;ery, and his amu&s;ement con&s;i&s;ted in the cultivation of polite litera|ture; but, more particularly, in frequenting the haunts of the mu&s;es. It may not, perhaps, be deemed inadmi&s;&s;ible to ob&s;erve, that, during the whole time of his apprentice&s;hip to the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital, he attended the theatre but twice, both times in complai|&s;ance to my importunity. His fir&s;t vi&s;it was, to be pre&s;ent at the performance of Shake&s;pear's celebrated tragedy of Othello; and his &s;econd, at that of the Revenge, by Dr. Young. Though &s;truck by the brilliancy and elegance of the &s;cenery of the &s;tage, and delighted with the &s;ublimity of &s;entiment, and energy of expre&s;&s;ion, which characterize tho&s;e two monuments of genius, his enjoyment was, notwith|&s;tanding, mingled with much regret, that talents, which might be employed for the important purpo&s;e of ameliorating the condition of man, &s;hould be &s;uf|fered to evaporate in theatrical declamation!</P>
<P>Of the attention and ability, with which he di&s;charg|ed his numerous and arduous offices, as an appren|tice to the ho&s;pital, the united applau&s;e of the mana|gers and phy&s;icians of that benevolent in&s;titution, con&s;titute the mo&s;t re&s;pectable degree of te&s;timony. Never were the duties of that appointment performed with greater tenderne&s;s, fidelity, and &s;kill, than when it was filled by our decea&s;ed colleague. But this fact does not, for its authenticity, re&s;t, exclu&s;ively, on
<PB N="24" REF="035262_0024_1001B3EB9F305448">
the evidence with which we are furni&s;hed by the ma|nagers and phy&s;icians: it is &s;till farther &s;ub&s;tantiated, by the &s;pontaneous reports, and heart-felt effu&s;ions, of many individuals, who, during his apprentice&s;hip, found an a&s;&s;ylum from death, within the walls of the ho&s;pital. Long will the&s;e characters, with gratitude, remember, and long will they continue to declare to the world, with what &s;kill and &s;olicitude he combated their di&s;ea&s;es; and, with what a friendly and unweari|ed hand, he held to their view the all-&s;upporting mir|ror of hope. Nor will this be the amount of their tributary evidence&mdash;Often will they forego the gene|ral and fa&s;hionable topics of conver&s;ation, to &s;peak of the times, when, as he pa&s;&s;ed along the wards, who&s;e very breezes were the vehicle of &s;ighs, and who&s;e walls had been long the melancholy man&s;ion of the echo of di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;oftentimes, I &s;ay, will they delight to tell, how, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, the benignity of his addre&s;s, and the &s;ympathy of his manners, &s;u&s;|pended the impre&s;&s;ion of their ruthle&s;s maladies, and lulled, for a while, their agonies to re&s;t! Thus, amid the wild di&s;order of a troubled ocean, does oil, diffu&s;ed over the &s;urface of the water, afford a tem|porary re&s;pite to the convul&s;ions of the deep!</P>
<P>But tho&s;e within the walls, where he re&s;ided, were not the only objects who experienced his beneficence and humanity. The out-patients of the ho&s;pital were, at that time, numerous, and widely di&s;per&s;ed through the city and liberties. I will venture to affirm, with|out any wi&s;h to throw a &s;hade over the merits of his predece&s;&s;ors, that his exertions, for alleviating the &s;uf|ferings of the&s;e indigent applicants, were unprecedented
<PB N="25" REF="035262_0025_1001B3F5670E7D48">
in the annals of the in&s;titution which he &s;erved. Of this de&s;cription of patients he vi&s;ited upwards of five hun|dred, during the two la&s;t years of his apprentice&s;hip. Nor did he attend them with that cold indifference, which, too generally, characterizes the actions of man, when directed to objects of wretchedne&s;s and charity. Painfully &s;en&s;ible to their &s;ufferings and wants, he was a &s;tranger to that counterfeit humanity, which evapo|rates in the empty parade and profe&s;&s;ions of &s;ympathy. Leaving to others the &s;u&s;picious practice of announ|cing, in words, their benevolent and charitable di&s;po|&s;itions, he &s;poke, by his actions, the reality of his feelings. When called on to admini&s;ter relief in the line of his profe&s;&s;ion, his exertions were paramount to every difficulty. Neither the inclemency of the weather, nor the untimeline&s;s of the hour, could operate as barriers to the accompli&s;hment of his pur|po&s;es. The &s;tream of humanity, i&s;&s;uing from the copi|ous re&s;ervoir of his heart, was neither to be congealed by the wintry bla&s;t, nor evaporated to dryne&s;s by the &s;ummer blaze! Fed by a tributary &s;treamlet from every fibre in his &s;y&s;tem, it could be exhau&s;ted, only, with the termination of his life! There &s;tands &s;carce|ly a hovel of indigence in the neighbourhood of the ho&s;pital (and the &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of many at a di&s;tance) that does not exhibit &s;ome memorial of his &s;kill, as a phy&s;ician, and of his humanity, as a man. Such was the labour and a&s;&s;iduity with which he attended the&s;e objects of penury and misfortune, that the temporary lo&s;s of his own health was not unfrequently the painful con&s;equence. In his toil|&s;ome rounds, to admini&s;ter to the&s;e paupers gratu|itous relief, he was lighted on his way by the twink|ling

fires of the night, perhaps, not much le&s;s fre|qently than by the orb of day. But for this, his re|ward was high and enviable: it was nothing le&s;s than a con&s;cious enjoyment of the heaven-born "luxury of doing good!"&mdash;a reward, denied to all except to minds of true benevolence! Allow me to add, a re|ward, for the enjoyment of which, no mind was more perfectly calculated&mdash;no mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a more exqui|&s;ite reli&s;h, than that of our friend, whom we this day commemorate!</P>
<P>So wi&s;e and economical was Dr. Cooper's divi&s;ion and appropriation of time, that, notwith&s;tanding the wide and diver&s;ified &s;cene of his active engagements, he &s;till found lei&s;ure for cultivating the field of gene|ral &s;cience. To the divi&s;ions of chemi&s;try, and natu|ral hi&s;tory (including the &s;ubordinate compartment of botany) he exhibited a more decided and elective attachment. In the&s;e delightful and important branches of &s;cience, his accumulation of knowledge was alrea|dy exten&s;ive and re&s;pectable. Had he lived to the cu&s;tomary period of human life, there is little doubt, but that he would have acquired a place and a name among the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed chemi&s;ts and naturali&s;ts of the age.</P>
<P>Nor did either his ta&s;te for polite literature, or his propen&s;ity to frequent the haunts of the mu&s;es, for|&s;ake him while immer&s;ed in the cares and duties of the ho&s;pital.

On taking a general &s;urvey of the character of our departed fellow-member, quality has crouded on my view after quality, and virtue after virtue, and each one too fair and tempting to be pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed. Nor have I yet completed the illu&s;trious catalogue. Though &s;ome &s;mall tribute has been paid, yet &s;till am I deeply in arrears to his merit. I have briefly &s;po|ken of the phy&s;ical talents he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and have &s;lightly glanced at &s;ome of the amiable qualities of his heart. But re&s;pecting his moral virtues, I have, hitherto, been &s;ilent. To &s;uffer the&s;e to remain &s;till in the back ground, unnoticed, and unapprai&s;ed, would render my biographic &s;ketch extremely imperfect and

exceptionable, and would, indeed, be little le&s;s than trea&s;on to the memory of our friend!</P>
<P>Of the moral virtues of Dr. Cooper I can &s;ay, in general, that their connected lu&s;tre con&s;tituted the ur&s;a major, the brighte&s;t con&s;tellation in the hemi&s;|phere of his character. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed none of tho&s;e wild irregularities, none of tho&s;e immoral habits, none of tho&s;e vicious propen&s;ities, which are too of|ten the lamentable concomitants of genius. Time would fail me were I to attempt a detailed and indivi|dual de&s;cription of this fair and ine&s;timable a&s;&s;emblage of virtues. I can only add, that they were &s;uch, as &s;eemed calculated to form a perfect equilibrium and corre&s;pondence between the moral and phy&s;ical parts of his character. We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s powers of intellect origi|nally &s;trong? his moral virtues were, in like manner, un&s;ullied&mdash;Were the former improved by high culti|vation? the latter were confirmed by experience and habit.</P>
<P>But in that galaxy, formed by the combined radi|ance of the moral qualities of Dr. Cooper, there were two which &s;hone with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre. I mean his love of ju&s;tice, and his attachment to the indefea&s;ible rights of man. Such was the power of the&s;e two virtues, that it led him to a voluntary &s;acri|fice of more than half his fortune, by executing ma|numi&s;&s;ions to all his &s;laves. Nor was this action per|formed with that pau&s;ing he&s;itation, that calculating reluctance, characteri&s;tic of a ba&s;e and mercenary di&s;|po&s;ition: It was &s;pontaneous and prompt, as if pro|ceeding from a mind urged on by a pure and irre&s;i&s;t|ible
<PB N="30" REF="035262_0030_1001B41597237E10">
&s;en&s;e of right. Le&s;t accident, or death, might intercept the accompli&s;hment of his upright and be|nevolent purpo&s;es, Dr. Cooper executed manumi&s;&s;ions to his negroes, on the morning of the day in which he had emerged from the character of a minor. De|termined that the &s;un &s;hould never behold him volun|tarily aiding in the unprincipled bu&s;ine&s;s of African &s;lavery, before that luminary had gilded the moun|tains with his earlie&s;t beams, the pen was in his hand, to &s;ub&s;cribe to the deed, that now gilds his memory with &s;uch a blaze of honour. But his humanity, on this occa&s;ion, was in no degree inferior to his love of ju&s;tice, which re&s;tored to freedom this injured people. For tho&s;e of his &s;laves who were incapable of &s;elf-government and &s;upport, he made &s;uch provi&s;ions, as were &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve them from poverty and want.</P>
<P>As far as relates to the enjoyment of freedom, he acknowledged no di&s;tinction between the &s;able Afri|can, in his humble hut, and the lordly monarch on his ermined throne. So liberal and exten&s;ive were his &s;entiments and &s;chemes of benevolence, that, like the all-pervading light of heaven, they embraced the whole circle of animated nature.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The extent of the charity, benevolence, and al&s;o of the grati|tude of Dr. Cooper, is evidenced by the tenor of his la&s;t will and te&s;tament, &s;ubjoined as an appendix to this publication. This in|&s;trument is, without any comment, re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted to the attention of the reader. I would beg leave, however, to ob&s;erve, that it &s;peaks the prai&s;es of the te&s;tator, in a higher &s;train of eulo|gium, than even the pen of a Burke or a Grattan could be&s;tow?</NOTE> In this re&s;pect, he even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the compliment paid to the late earl

of Chatham, by his eloquent friend and eulogi&s;t, the celebrated Grattan. In &s;ketching the outlines of the character of this unrivalled &s;tate&s;man and orator, the Iri&s;h Demo&s;thenes has the following bold and com|prehen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ion. "His object was England, his ambition was fame." With truth may I &s;ay of our departed friend, that his object was more than Eng|land, it was the peopled world; and that his ambiti|on was more than fame, it was the happine&s;s of the whole human race!</P>
<P>But I have not yet completed my analy&s;is of his mind, nor &s;ummed up, in full, my account of his me|rit. Over the preceding a&s;&s;emblage of talents and of virtues, was thrown a &s;hade of retiring mode&s;ty, which, by &s;oftening and even, in appearance, at|tempting to conceal their lu&s;tre, rendered them dou|bly impre&s;&s;ive and intere&s;ting. Thus, the gauzy veil, floating before the countenances of the fair, height|ens their beauty, and adds &s;uperior power to their charms. And, thus, the &s;hadowy curtains of the night, &s;pread along the vault of heaven, awaken into life the lu&s;tre and beauty of its &s;lumbering fires!</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the theological principles of Dr. Cooper, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, except that he was an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of the pure and &s;ublime morality of the chri&s;tian religion, and regulated, by its pre|cepts, the tenor of his conduct. So &s;uperlative was his attachment to a life of peace, that he was never known to interfere in a controver&s;y, either of a religi|ous or of a political nature. He was a quaker, by prin|ciple and adoption, though not by birth or early edu|cation.
<PB N="32" REF="035262_0032_1001B425576384B0">
He was led to attach him&s;elf to this denomi|nation of chri&s;tians, in con&s;equence of di&s;covering, that their &s;entiments and collective di&s;po&s;ition were, in mo&s;t re&s;pects, in uni&s;on with his own. He admir|ed the mode&s;t &s;implicity of their manners, the moral|ity and uprightne&s;s of their general conduct, and their love of an orderly and peaceful life, and, therefore, re&s;olved to become one of their &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In May, ninety &s;even, our colleague completed his &s;tudies, and was admitted to the degree of doctor of medicine, in the univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania. On this occa&s;ion, he acquitted him&s;elf, in all re&s;pects, with di&s;tingui&s;hed reputation. But his celebrity, as a gra|duate, aro&s;e, more particularly, from the merit of his inaugural di&s;&s;ertation. This performance treated of the hi&s;tory and medicinal virtues of the <HI>Datura Stram|monium,</HI> an indigenous and very powerful vegetable of our country. It is not exce&s;&s;ive eulogy to &s;ay, that, as a piece of experimental inve&s;tigation, it is not, perhaps, inferior to any di&s;&s;ertation, of the kind, that has ever appeared, either in this, or in any other country. Was America favoured with many &s;uch pupils, to adorn, by graduation, her ri&s;ing &s;emina|ries, we would &s;oon become acquainted with the me|dicinal virtues and powers of all her indigenous ve|getables, many of which now bloom and wither in her fields and fore&s;ts, neglected through inattention, and, through ignorance, unknown!</P>
<P>In the autumn of ninety-&s;even, Dr. Cooper left the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital (his term of apprentice&s;hip hav|ing now expired) and &s;ettled, as a practitioner of me|dicine,

in the city of Philadelphia. He had, previ|ou&s;ly to this, received &s;everal pre&s;&s;ing, and very flat|tering, invitations to &s;ettle in different and re&s;pectable parts of the country; but he rejected them all, de|claring, that he had rather live on bread and water, in Philadelphia, in the mid&s;t of literary &s;ocieties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Cooper was, already, an active, faithful, and di&s;tingui&s;h|ed member of various literary in&s;titutions in Philadelphia.

<P>Though &s;urrounded by phy&s;icians of talents, learn|ing, long e&s;tabli&s;hments, and powerful family con|nections, yet &s;till was he ri&s;ing, with rapidity, in pro|fe&s;&s;ional reputation. Already was he employed by many wealthy and re&s;pectable families: already was he, occa&s;ionally, called into con&s;ultation with the old and e&s;tabli&s;hed practitioners of the city, who had, even, been his fathers and teachers in medicine. But his principal bu&s;ine&s;s, and, with truth, may I add, his principal plea&s;ure, as a phy&s;ician, aro&s;e from his hu|mane and gratuitous attentions to the poor. His ha|bits of practical benevolence and charity he did not leave behind him, within the walls of the ho&s;pital. He bore them with him to the heart of the city, even farther brightened and confirmed by a change of &s;itu|ation. Thus the fruit tree, ingrafted on a foreign &s;tock, or tran&s;planted into a different &s;oil, regales the &s;en&s;es by a greater luxuriance of flowers and
<PB N="34" REF="035262_0034_1001B42E8F855BB0">
fruit! A knowledge of this, often drew to his door objects of poverty, wretchedne&s;s, and di&s;ea&s;e. Nor did he ever give them cau&s;e to go murmuring or di&s;|con&s;olate away. By his &s;kill, as a phy&s;ician, he ad|mini&s;tered relief to their maladies, and, by the cheer|fulne&s;s of his conver&s;ation, the mildne&s;s of his man|ners, and the inde&s;cribable tenderne&s;s of his attention, as a man, he often &s;ucceeded in di&s;&s;ipating the gloom that over&s;hadowed their minds.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed, till the month of Augu&s;t, ninety-eight, the hours of our beloved colleague, not con|&s;umed in a round of di&s;&s;ipation, not immer&s;ed in apa|thetic indolence, nor yet devoted to the indulgence of philo&s;ophic ea&s;e&mdash;but divided between the real du|ties of his profe&s;&s;ion, the active pur&s;uits of &s;cience, and the various offices of charity, ari&s;ing out of his &s;ituation. At this period an event occurred, which the genius of Philadelphia has already enrolled in the darke&s;t page of her catalogue of misfortunes, and the effects of which, &s;he will long&mdash;very long, con|tinue, with ju&s;tice, to deplore. Nor did, even, the ge|nius of Columbia remain in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;orrows of his daughter. The general concerns of the nation, for a while, neglected, he appeared to mingle his tears with hers, over &s;uch an unprecedented in&s;tance of calamity. But the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our city were not confined to the bo&s;oms of its own immediate inhabi|tants: Like the ripple, &s;preading around over the &s;ur|face of the lake, they were communicated along the inexplicable web of human feeling, till, by brea&s;ts of &s;ympathy, they were finally realized, even in the mo&s;t di&s;tant extremes of our country.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="035262_0035_1001B43634B024D8">To you it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to mention the cau&s;e of this unparalleled extent and complexity of di&s;tre&s;s. It is already imprinted on your memories, in charac|ters, which, in point of permanency, beggar any im|pre&s;&s;ions that can po&s;&s;ibly re&s;ult from my feeble ac|cents. It is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to inform you, that, at this period, we were a third time vi&s;ited by that fir&s;t of phy&s;ical evils, which, by way of pre-eminence in horror and fatality, our divines have emphatically denominated "the de&s;troying angel," I mean the vengeful &s;pirit of pe&s;tilence! This in&s;atiate demon (like the poet's Python, de&s;cended from the ferment|ing filth, depo&s;ited by the waters of Deucalion's flood)&mdash;this demon, I &s;ay, &s;prung from the co-opera|ting &s;ources of filth, in our city, our &s;uburbs, and along our wharves, invaded our habitations in all his horrors. Nor did he come alone: Terror was com|mi&s;&s;ioned the leader of his van, while agony, death, and de&s;olation were mar&s;halled in the rear. Thus ac|companied, and thus arrayed, the malignant &s;pirit &s;wept, with his inexorable myrmidons, along our &s;treets, diffu&s;ing around his envenomed breath. At once were our pro&s;pects of plea&s;ure and &s;ecurity bla&s;t|ed; at once was the a&s;pect of our city metamorpho&s;ed. No longer the crouded emporium of our country&mdash;no longer the haunt of gaiety and ea&s;e, Philadelphia was converted into a &s;cene of con&s;ternation and tumult. From every tongue dropped expre&s;&s;ions of terror&mdash; on every face &s;at the gloom of dejection, mingled with the wildne&s;s of deep apprehen&s;ion. Flying from the city, as if its foundations were convul&s;ed by the rockings of an earthquake, or its buildings threaten|ed

to be whelmed in a deluge of lava, the eyes and foot&s;teps of all were directed in que&s;t of an a&s;&s;ylum, in the depth of the country!

<P>Amid this embattled chaos of di&s;order and confu|&s;ion, our departed colleague was by no means, an idle, or an indifferent &s;pectator. He early di&s;covered, and mo&s;t devoutly deprecated, the impending cloud of calamity, nor &s;aw, without &s;olicitude, the bur&s;ting of the tempe&s;t. But his fears and anxieties re&s;pected not his own per&s;onal health and &s;afety. They &s;prang from a much more generous &s;ource, the health and &s;afety of his friends and fellow-citizens. Calm, intre|pid, and re&s;igned, as far as re&s;pected him&s;elf, he re|&s;olved, from the fir&s;t, to ride out the &s;torm, or be wrecked, a faithful and &s;pontaneous matryr to the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion. So powerful was this &s;en&s;e of duty, and &s;o unconquerable this &s;entiment of hero|i&s;m, that neither the entreaties of his friends, nor the mo&s;t bold and picture&s;que repre&s;entation of the dan|ger that awaited him, could have the &s;malle&s;t effect in diverting him from his purpo&s;e. With a mind that delighted in contending with difficulties&mdash;a mind, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing an elective attraction to objects of greatne&s;s,
<PB N="37" REF="035262_0037_1001B440FA38A1F0">
he determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to take his &s;tand, amid the mo&s;t formidable concentration of di&s;ea&s;e!</P>
<P>While influenced by this temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, Dr. Cooper was called, in conjunction with his illu&s;trious friend and colleague, Dr. Phy&s;ic, to take the medical charge of the city ho&s;pital. The end and object of this in&s;titution it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to mention. It is known to you all, to have been in|tended, as a receptacle for pe&s;tilential &s;ubjects, from all parts of the city and liberties. Amid the ravages of &s;uch a de&s;olating calamity, the walls of the ho&s;|pital were &s;oon found to be too contracted, to an&s;wer the benevolent purpo&s;es of its e&s;tabli&s;hment. So un|expectedly rapid and profu&s;e was the influx of the &s;ick, that it became nece&s;&s;ary to pitch tents, and erect temporary buildings for their accomodation.</P>
<P>Here was a &s;cene, where, even, the mind of Dr. Cooper might find ample room for the exerci&s;e of all its powers, and the exhibition of all its virtues. Here it might exhau&s;t the &s;ources of its &s;trength and inge|nuity, here find &s;cope for its unwearied activity, here expend the la&s;t drop of its benevolence and humani|ty!&mdash;For the ability and addre&s;s of the phy&s;ician, here exi&s;ted a malignant and formidable epitome of all febrile di&s;ea&s;es; for the engagement of the man of active indu&s;try, here were duties, numerous, diver&s;i|fied, and pre&s;&s;ing, in the extreme; and to excite the &s;ympathetic attention of the man of humanity and benevolence, here was a con&s;ummation of wretched|ne&s;s and mi&s;ery!</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="035262_0038_1001B44BB85981B0">In each branch of this threefold character, Dr. Cooper was qualified to acquit him&s;elf with equal e|minence. But, on the pre&s;ent important and melan|choly occa&s;ion, the extent of his abilities was the only mea&s;ure of the &s;ervices he rendered. It is not &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that his life, while engaged in the city ho&s;pital, was a circle of action, it was an uninterrupted &s;eries of laborious exertion. Ever awake to the whi&s;perings of duty&mdash;ever painfully &s;en&s;ible to the &s;ufferings of his pa|tients, he acted as the phy&s;ician, the nur&s;e, and the friend, to tho&s;e whom di&s;ea&s;e had &s;ubjected to his care. But his attention to him&s;elf bore an inver&s;e ra|tio to his attention to others. Ab&s;orbed in his views of public good, his own individual &s;afety was bani&s;h|ed from his mind. In his exce&s;&s;ive zeal for the inter|e&s;t of the in&s;titution which he &s;erved, he even neg|lected or re&s;i&s;ted the calls of his &s;y&s;tem for refre&s;h|ment and repo&s;e. Often has he relinqui&s;hed his table for the more delicious banquet of contributing to the relief and &s;afety of the agonized objects by which he was &s;urrounded&mdash;Often has the noon of night looked down, with approbation, on his round, through the crowded wards, and the following day-dawn de&s;|cried him remote from his pillow!</P>
<P>In the intervals of his exertion as a phy&s;ician, nur&s;e, and friend, to the &s;ick, he devoted his time to di&s;&s;ec|tions, and various phy&s;ical experiments, calculated to throw light on the &s;eat, the cau&s;e, the nature, and the treatment of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es. By this was his &s;ituation rendered doubly perilous. But, in a mind like his, a &s;en&s;e of duty, co-operating with a zeal for the promotion of &s;cience, is paramount to every &s;el|fi&s;h

Under &s;uch a combination of circum&s;tances, the &s;eeds of pe&s;tilence, which Dr. Cooper appears to have inhaled from the atmo&s;phere of Philadelphia, and which had lain, for &s;ome time, dormant in his &s;y&s;tem, could not avoid being awak|ened into life and action. Accordingly, this melancho|ly occurrence took place on the 26th of Augu&s;t, the &s;ame month in which he received his appointment to the ho&s;pital.</P>

<P>To the melancholy circum&s;tances attending the clo&s;e of the life of Dr. Cooper, I beg leave to apply a quotation from an epi&s;tolary poem, I had the plea|&s;ure to receive from him, in the autumn of ninety-three, in which, with a boldne&s;s and pathos peculiar to him&s;elf, he de&s;cribes and laments the death of an intimate friend, who fell a &s;acrifice to the pe&s;tilence of that period.</P>
<Q><L>The young di&s;ea&s;e, wak'd by &s;ome demon's rage,</L>
<L>A&s;&s;erts its &s;way, o'erpowers his vigorous age,</L>
<L>Along his &s;y&s;tem &s;teals in tremors fleet,</L>
<L>Shakes his lax arms, and chills his torpid feet,</L>
<L>O'er his red cheek, and redder eye ball glows,</L>
<L>Burns in his bo&s;om, rends his aching brows,</L>
<L>Goads and inflames his &s;tomach's velvet &s;ides,</L>
<L>In torturing trains through every fibre glides,</L>
<L>Or, with delirium, fierce, a&s;&s;ails, en&s;hrin'd</L>
<L>In the bright brain, the &s;hadowy tribes of mine&mdash;</L>
<L>Now, i&s;&s;uing from pale lips, dark currents flow,</L>
<L>Or, downward, &s;eek the long canal below,</L>
<L>And bile, in novel ducts meandering, dies</L>
<L>His lifele&s;s limbs, and paints his beamle&s;s eyes&mdash;</L>
<L>Weak throbs his heart, and faint the living fire,</L>
<L>And failing lungs unaltered air re&s;pire,</L>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF <HI>DR. SAMUEL COOPER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I, SAMUEL COOPER, late of Maryland, but now of Philadelphia, phy&s;ician, do make my la&s;t will and te&s;tament, in manner and form following, viz.</P>
<P>I will, that my debts be di&s;charged, and my fune|ral expen&s;es paid by my executors.</P>
<P>Having always abhorred &s;lavery, in every &s;hape, I have freed all my negroes, by executing, as I appre|hend, proper manumi&s;&s;ions; but if any thing is infor|mally done, or any thing is wanting to complete their emancipation, I reque&s;t my executors to do it, and to liberate the girls at eighteen, and the boys at twenty-one years of age, if any of them &s;urvive me, and to charge the expen&s;e to my e&s;tate; and I allow my executors, if they &s;ee occa&s;ion, to pay any charge that may be found nece&s;&s;ary by them, to procure &s;uitable places for the young children, and to &s;ecure to them the opportunity of obtaining a little &s;chool learning.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="035262_0046_1001B4782CDC15C8"><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;I will, that my executors collect my out|&s;tanding debts, in particular, a legacy of one hundred and fifty pounds, with its intere&s;t, which was left me by my grandfather, Thomas Winche&s;ter, decea&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;I will, that my executors, hereafter named, &s;hall &s;ell, at any time they may think be&s;t, at public or private &s;ale, for ca&s;h or on credit, at their own di&s;cretion, my two plantations or tracts of land, in Talbot county, in the &s;tate of Maryland, with all their improvements, and make good and &s;ufficient titles for the &s;aid lands and improvements, to the purcha&s;er or purcha&s;ers, in fee &s;imple; and all the monies ari&s;ing therefrom (after payment of my debts, and providing, if need be, for my young negroes, as above mentioned) I give, with all the &s;ecurities they may take for the &s;aid lands, to <HI>the Contributors to the Penn&s;ylvania Ho&s;pital.</HI> But as it may happen, that I may &s;ell tho&s;e lands my&s;elf, which I have &s;ome thoughts of doing, it is my will, in that ca&s;e, that the &s;aid contributors &s;hall have and po&s;&s;e&s;s all the monies and &s;ecurities I take for both or either of tho&s;e places, in the &s;ame manner as if my executors were to &s;ell them, under the preceding directions.</P>
<P>Having &s;erved my apprentice&s;hip in the Penn&s;ylva|nia ho&s;pital, I know it to be a mo&s;t valuable and u&s;e|ful in&s;titution, not only as the be&s;t a&s;ylum in Ameri|ca, for lunatics and the &s;ick poor, but al&s;o the be&s;t &s;chool of in&s;truction for a medical pupil. With the&s;e &s;entiments, I e&s;teem it a duty I owe to the communi|ty, to devote my earthly &s;ub&s;tance to encourage and promote it, in preference to any temporal con&s;idera|tion;
<PB N="47" REF="035262_0047_1001AEDC7B81EEB8">
I do, therefore, give to the contributors to the &s;aid ho&s;pital and to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever, as well my &s;aid two plantations, as all the monies that may ari&s;e from the &s;ale thereof, by me, or by my execu|tors, and all my other e&s;tate, both real and per&s;onal, what&s;oever, to and for the following u&s;es, viz.</P>
<P>I reque&s;t them to buy a neat, &s;ub&s;tantial coachee, or light waggon, that will conveniently hold a dri|ver and &s;ix per&s;ons, with its furniture complete, to procure which I allow them to pay a &s;um not to ex|ceed &s;ix hundred dollars.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;I reque&s;t them to buy two good, &s;ound, and able-bodied hor&s;es, neither of which to be more than eight years old, in the opinion of good judges; to purcha&s;e which, I allow them to expend a &s;um not exceeding five hundred dollars.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;I allow them to retain, of my e&s;tate, any &s;um they may think &s;ufficient to pay a coachman two years' wages.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>&mdash;I recommend that the carriage or hor&s;es may never be lent from the hou&s;e, nor &s;uffered to be out all night, unle&s;s the carriage is &s;ent to be mended, or the hor&s;es to pa&s;ture; that it be u&s;ed, only, for the pa|tients and their needful attendants, or to bring to, or take from, the ho&s;pital, the managers, trea&s;urer, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> phy&s;icians, when employed in the &s;ervice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hou&s;e; and it is further my de&s;ire, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> may never be driven, on any pretence, more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> miles in one day.

<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I nominate and appoint my friends, Samuel Coates, Thomas Morris, Mordecai Lewis, and Elli&s;|ton Perot, the executors of this my la&s;t will and te&s;|tament, hereby revoking and making null and void, every other will by me heretofore made.</P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here|unto affixed my &s;eal and &s;ub&s;cribed my name, <DATE>this fifteenth day of Augu&s;t, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-&s;even.</DATE></DATELINE>
