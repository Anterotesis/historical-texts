<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE DISEASES INCIDENT TO ARMIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE great and frequent inconveniences attending a military life, are of &s;uch a nature, as to make the greate&s;t ha|vock even among the mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;ti|tutions. It is not, therefore &s;urpri&s;ing, that an Army is &s;eldom or ever without a great number of &s;ick.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, it has been ob&s;erved, that the di&s;tempers mo&s;tly prevalent among the Troops are not in number very con&s;i|derable.</P>
<P>WE have, for this rea&s;on, thought it &s;ufficient to &s;peak of tho&s;e, who&s;e attacks the &s;oldier is mo&s;t &s;ubject to, to de&s;cribe them in &s;uch a manner, as they may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another by certain &s;igns; and at the &s;ame time to give an ac|count of &s;uch &s;ymptoms as characteri&s;e the decrea&s;e or increa&s;e of each di&s;order; and la&s;tly, to &s;pecify the medicines proper for the cure of the &s;ick, and the diet they are to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015100_0005_0F95D31BAD5B63A0">IT will be perceived, that, in our little E&s;&s;ay on this &s;ubject, it was equally nece&s;|&s;ary to be &s;hort, and to endeavour to avoid being ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>THIS Work, however, no wi&s;e regards the Phy&s;icians, who, ma&s;ters of their art, and in daily practice, &s;tand in no need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e fir&s;t elements.</P>
<P>BUT it often happens, in an army, that the number of &s;ick is &s;o great, and they are di&s;per&s;ed in &s;o many different places, that it is impo&s;&s;ible the phy&s;icians &s;hould go every where, and give their attendance to each individual. In &s;uch ca&s;es, nece&s;|&s;ity obliges the &s;ick to be entru&s;ted to per|&s;ons who cannot be expected to have the &s;ame knowledge with tho&s;e of the profe&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>FOR the u&s;e of &s;uch practitioners, not &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed, this &s;mall Tract is de&s;igned, that, by the &s;igns exactly de&s;crib|ed, they may under&s;tand the nature of the di&s;temper, the conduct they are to ob&s;erve, and the remedies proper to be admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>AT the end are in&s;erted the RECIPES or pre&s;criptions referred to in the cour&s;e of the Work. They are rendered as &s;imple as po&s;&s;ible, and preference given to tho&s;e medicines that are ea&s;ie&s;t to be procured, and ea&s;ie&s;t to be prepared.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="015100_0006_0F95D31C6A162798">IT may not be ami&s;s to premi&s;e &s;ome ob&s;ervations, by means of which, &s;ickne&s;s may in &s;ome degree be prevented, and the health of the &s;oldier pre&s;erved. We are &s;en&s;ible, that, in time of war, it is not al|ways po&s;&s;ible to ob&s;erve exactly all what we are going to &s;ay; but it cannot but be of u&s;e to know what is mo&s;t advantageous, that it may be put in practice, at lea&s;t when circum&s;tances permit.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> The &s;oldier fre&s;h li&s;ted, and torn at once from his family, no &s;ooner lo&s;es &s;ight of his village, but he becomes melan|choly; and tho' a robu&s;t hu&s;bandman, finds him&s;elf &s;carce able to bear the fatigues and inconveniences of a military life. It were to be wi&s;hed, that he could be u&s;ed, little by little, to this new kind of life; but in the mean time nothing is better, than to procure him all kinds of amu&s;ement and diver&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> GARDEN &s;tuff and fre&s;h greens are a whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment for the &s;ol|dier; ripe fruits are equally good, and never hurt but by their abu&s;e; but unripe and acrid fruits are very hurtful. The u&s;e of garden &s;tuff and fruit prevents the &s;curvy, and even cures tho&s;e already attacked with it.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> THE choice of water is e&s;&s;en|tial:
<PB N="8" REF="015100_0007_0F95D31E224C9BF0">
If there is none to be found ab&s;o|lutely pure, the preference is to be given to that lea&s;t loaded with heterogeneous parts. There is an ea&s;y way to di&s;tingui&s;h water that is pure, from that which is le&s;s &s;o, by means of <HI>oleum tartari per deliquium.</HI> If you let fall a few drops of this in a gla&s;s of water, if not pure, it becomes in&s;tantly thick, and milky, whil&s;t the &s;ame opera|tion produces only a &s;mall cloud in that which is more pure.</P>
<P>RIVER water &s;hould not be drawn near the banks; that which is in the middle of the &s;tream is always be&s;t.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, indeed, Troops are re|duced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of drinking bad water; in which ca&s;e it may be much cor|rected, by mixing a certain quantity of vinegar. Six ounces, mixed with three quarts of water, will render the drink even more agreeable.</P>
<P>THE water may al&s;o be rendered le&s;s hurtful by &s;teeping in it &s;ome pieces of the root of the <HI>calamus aromaticus.</HI> This root is found every where, e&s;pecially in mar&s;hy places, where commonly the water is wor&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth.</HI> THE &s;oldier ought to be well clothed and covered; his &s;hoes of a thick and &s;trong leather. and the thread they are &s;ewed with well covered with wax:
<PB REF="015100_0008_0F95D31EAAD7E928">
if all the &s;eams could be well waxed the water would be prevented from penetrating.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth.</HI> CAMPS ought to be pitched on a dry &s;pot, as much as po&s;&s;ible. That which appears &s;uch is &s;ometimes quite the rever&s;e, becau&s;e the waters are but at a little di&s;tance below the &s;urface. It is, however, very ea&s;y to know that, by digging the ground, or even merely by examining the wells of the neighbouring villages</P>
<P>IF the water is high in the wells, the &s;oil is damp,; if the water is low, the &s;oil is dry.</P>
<P>IT would likewi&s;e be proper to avoid the neighbourhood of thick fore&s;ts; they prevent the wind from penetrating, and render the air of the circumjacent parts damp and clo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT if there is a nece&s;&s;ity of encamping in a damp ground, the &s;oldiers mu&s;t have their &s;traw changed oftner than u&s;ual. The officers will be much benefited by &s;preading a waxed cloth under their bed.</P>
<P>IN times of rain, the tighter the tents are extended, the le&s;s it penetrates: &s;mall trenches dug round the tents contri|bute to the dryne&s;s of the &s;pot where the &s;oldier lies, becau&s;e they receive the water that falls from above.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth.</HI> WHEN an army remains long
<PB REF="015100_0009_0F95D31F6B581D78">
in the &s;ame camp, the unwhole&s;ome ef|fluvia from &s;o many bodies always occa&s;ion &s;ickne&s;s, unle&s;s there happen to be violent and frequent winds. The&s;e exahalations are mo&s;tly to be feared in a hot and moi&s;t air. The changes of camps on this ac|count, contribute much to the health of the &s;oldier, more e&s;pecially when the bloody flux prevails. Hence ari&s;es one rea&s;on the more for avoiding the neigh|bourhood of thick fore&s;ts, which prevent the free pa&s;&s;age of the winds.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh.</HI> NOTHING is more prejudicial to the &s;oldier, when heated with work, than to &s;trip, expo&s;e him&s;elf to the cool air, and greedily drink cold water, and e&s;|pecially well-water, which commonly is very much &s;o. River water is le&s;s hurtful, as the rays of the Sun, to which it is con|&s;tantly expo&s;ed, prevent its being &s;o cold.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth.</HI> CARE mu&s;t be taken, during the great heats, that the &s;oldier on duty &s;hould remain expo&s;ed to the heat of the Sun as little as po&s;&s;ible, and that he avoid &s;leeping there. The cuira&s;&s;iers, e&s;pecially, when once their cuira&s;s is thoroughly heat|ed, are tho&s;e who &s;uffer mo&s;t by the &s;un.</P>
<P><HI>Ninth.</HI> NEATNESS connot be too much in&s;i&s;ted on. Let &s;oldiers frequently wa&s;h their hands, their face, and their feet;
<PB REF="015100_0010_0F95D3202A90B2B0">
and, if the &s;ea&s;on permits, let them bathe as much as po&s;&s;ible in running water.</P>
<P><HI>Tenth.</HI> GREAT care ought to be taken not to lodge many men together in a &s;mall &s;pace; and if it cannot be avoided, let the air be at lea&s;t renewed as often as it can, whether tho&s;e who lodge together are in health or &s;ickne&s;s; for from hence ari&s;e the mo&s;t dangerous, and even the contagious di&s;|tempers.</P>
<P><HI>Eleventh.</HI> THE bread ought to be well baked, and made of good and pure flour; for it is certain, that very dangerous di&s;|tempers are occa&s;ioned by mu&s;ty or &s;poiled bread.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE DISEASES OF THE ARMY.</HEAD>
<P>IF the troops encamp in the &s;pring, e&s;peci|ally early in the &s;ea&s;on, there will in|fallibly be many &s;ick. The Di&s;ea&s;es, that principally prevail at that time, are, very trouble&s;ome Coughs, &s;ore Throats, Pleu|ri&s;ies, Peripneumonies, and Rheumati&s;ms.</P>
<P>THESE Di&s;tempers, tho' not contagious, do not admit of much motion in the Pa|tients, wherefore it &s;hould be endeavoured to have the Ho&s;pitals nigh hand, and, if the &s;tate of the Di&s;temper requires it, to bleed the Patient, before he be moved, the delay of which may produce very trouble&s;ome con&s;equences.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES al&s;o intermitting Fevers pre|vail during this &s;ea&s;on, but they generally are le&s;s ob&s;tinate than tho&s;e that happen in Autumn. In Spring they are commonly Tertians, or Quotidians, but &s;eldom Quar|tans, unle&s;s in tho&s;e &s;ubjects, who have been before attacked during the Winter, and in whom, properly &s;peaking, they are only Relap&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>COUGHS.</HEAD>
<P>COUGHS are more trouble&s;ome than dangerous: but if they continue any of time, and are neglected, they &s;ome|times degenerate into a <HI>Phthi&s;is Pulmonalis.</HI></P>
<P>LET the Patient make u&s;e of the receipt No. 1. for his common drink, and drink it luke-warm; it will be of &s;ervice to add a fourth part of new milk.</P>
<P>THE Patient mu&s;t ab&s;tain from wine, from &s;alt and acid food. Rice, and barley broth, and new milk, with the yolk of an egg, will be &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>IF the Cough becomes too violent and trouble&s;ome, &s;o as to prevent the Patient from &s;leeping, he may take the pre&s;cription No 2.</P>
<P>IF the Cough is attended with a Fever, bleeding will be nece&s;&s;ary to prevent an In|flammation, which is then to be appre|hended.</P>
<P>WHEN the Cough dimini&s;hes, and the excretions, which before were without con|&s;i&s;tence, become thick, and are ea&s;ily ex|pectorated, the di&s;temper is at an end.</P>

<PB N="15" REF="015100_0014_0F95D3232E520070">
<HEAD>SORE THROAT.</HEAD>
<P>IF the action either of &s;wallowing or re&s;pi|ration &s;uffer an impediment, attended with &s;en&s;ible pain, and the cau&s;e is in the neck, or throat, the di&s;order is called a &s;ore Throat, (<HI>Angina.</HI>)</P>
<P>It is a very dangerous di&s;temper, and &s;ometimes even mortal; it is known to be &s;o, when re&s;piration is greatly impeded, the voice extremely &s;harpened, and the anxiety very con&s;iderable. A large bleeding is immediately requi&s;ite, and cupping gla&s;|&s;es are to be applied, around and on the nape of the neck, which often give in&s;tant relief: the drink No. 1. mu&s;t be kept con&s;tantly in the mouth warm; and the poultice No. 3. applied, and continued hot on the neck, night and day.</P>
<P>IF the Patient can &s;wallow, let him take every hour a cupfull of the drink No. 1. made hot, with the addition of twenty grains of purified nitre to each pint. If the redne&s;s appears on the neck or brea&s;t, the Patient often recovers. Otherwi&s;e this Di&s;ea&s;e is frequently mortal; but it is not common. The following &s;pecies is much more fre|quent.</P>
<P>ONE of the <HI>ton&s;ils,</HI> grows red, &s;welled,
<PB N="16" REF="015100_0015_0F95D323EDB2C6B8">
and painful, and the pain commonly ex|tends it&s;elf to the internal part of the ear of the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;ide. In a day or two, the Di&s;ea&s;e attacks the <HI>gland of the other &s;ide,</HI> while the &s;welling di&s;appears from that which was fir&s;t affected. Sometimes the pul&s;e is hard and quickened, and &s;ometimes not at all</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the urine appears of a deeper colour than it is in health; bleeding is then nece&s;&s;ary; and if the redne&s;s, &s;welling of the throat, and difficulty of breathing do not give way, it will be proper to repeat it.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd ca&s;e, viz. if the pul&s;e is na|tural, there is no nece&s;&s;ity for bleeding, un|le&s;s the Patient be of a replete habit.</P>
<P>THE nouri&s;hment mu&s;t be re&s;trained to light broth, to which may be added rice or barley <HI>cream.</HI></P>
<P>LET the Patient take a tea-cup of the drink No. 4. every hour, warm, unle&s;s he &s;leeps: and let him often keep in his mouth &s;ome of the medicated tea, No 5. warm, with which he is al&s;o to gargle his throat.</P>
<P>NEXT day let him be purged with the draught No. 6. which, if the di&s;order does not abate, he may take it again after two days, continuing, in the mean time, the u&s;e of No. 4. and No. 5. till he can &s;wallow
<PB N="17" REF="015100_0016_0F95D324AE0547D0">
freely, and the redne&s;s hath di&s;appeared from the in&s;ide of the throat.</P>
<P>IF the di&s;order has continued too long, be|fore relief was applied, or the inflammation is too con&s;iderable, (to give way,) &s;uppura|tion will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>THAT there will be a &s;uppuration is known, by the &s;welling and redne&s;s in the throat continuing above three days, without any abatement. In this ca&s;e, the Patient is to keep continually in his mouth &s;ome of the decoction No. 7. warm, which likewi&s;e may be lightly injected into his throat.</P>
<P>THE catapla&s;m No. 8. is to be applied, and kept night and day round about his throat.</P>
<P>If the &s;welling of the throat then begins to grow &s;oft, the ab&s;ce&s;s will &s;oon bur&s;t: if there appear a little &s;pot elevated and white, the concealed lancet <HI>(pharyngotomus)</HI> may with all &s;afety be u&s;ed, to give, by this means, a freer i&s;&s;ue to the pus.</P>
<P>The ab&s;ce&s;s being either broke of it&s;elf or opened by the lancet, the gargari&s;m No. 9. mu&s;t be frequently u&s;ed, and the cure will &s;oon be compleated.</P>
<P>WHEN it happens that the &s;welling pre|vents deglutition entirely, a gli&s;ter of twelve ounces of new milk and &s;ix ounces of barley water is to be admini&s;tered every four hours, which the Patient mu&s;t retain as long as he
<PB N="18" REF="015100_0017_0F95D3256C7A1BC0">
po&s;&s;ibly can. By this means he may be &s;u&s;|tained till the ab&s;ce&s;s breaks.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;till another &s;pecies of &s;ore throat, which, in the beginning, is ea&s;ily cured, but by neglect degenerates into a &s;ort of mortification, and corrodes all the parts attacked, cau&s;ing at the &s;ame time a mo&s;t horrible &s;tench.</P>
<P>THERE appears on the ton&s;ils, on the pa|late, on both &s;ides of the interior part of the mouth, or within the lips, one or &s;everal white &s;pots, &s;ometimes yellowi&s;h, and even brown, according as the di&s;order is more or le&s;s violent. The places round the&s;e &s;pots are much inflamed and painful. It &s;ome|times happens that the patient has no fever; and the &s;welling is never &s;o con&s;iderable in this ca&s;e, as in the before de&s;cribed &s;ore throat.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t &s;pecies generally goes off pretty &s;oon, by rubbing every two hours lightly the parts affected with a pencil dipped in the mixture No. 10. and u&s;ing for a gargari&s;m a &s;imple infu&s;ion of elder flowers. It is proper the Patient &s;hould drink &s;ome cups of the &s;ame infu&s;ion about four times a day.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that the &s;aid &s;pots in|crea&s;e very &s;uddenly, when the &s;tench of the mouth is great: in that ca&s;e, the quan|tity of <HI>&s;p. &s;al. mar.</HI> mu&s;t be augmented, to &s;top the progre&s;s of this evil.</P>

<HEAD>The PLEURISY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pleuri&s;y is known by a &s;harp pain, and &s;titches, felt in the brea&s;t, and at|tended with a fever.</P>
<P>THIS pain is increa&s;ed by in&s;piration, and le&s;&s;ened by ex&s;piration, and by holding the breath; the pul&s;e is generally hard, as in all acute and inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es: in violent Pleuri&s;ies the pain is &s;ometimes &s;o &s;harp, that the Patient &s;carce dares to draw his breath, the face grows lived, and he feels him&s;elf ju&s;t &s;uffocating; in this &s;tate the pul&s;e is &s;mall and low.</P>
<P>The Cough is almo&s;t continual, but inter|rupted by the violent pain: in &s;ome ca&s;es, this Cough is dry, without any excretion; in others it is, from the beginning, attend|ed with excretions; le&s;s danger is to be ap|prehended in the la&s;t ca&s;e than in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>THO' the &s;ides of the brea&s;t are mo&s;t com|monly attacked in this di&s;temper, yet the anterior and po&s;terior parts may be equally affected.</P>
<P>IF the pain is mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt exter|nally, and chiefly upon touching the part, the di&s;order is commonly named a fal&s;e Pleu|ri&s;y, and is to be treated as follows:</P>
<P>BLEEDING is the fir&s;t and chief remedy:
<PB N="20" REF="015100_0019_0F95D327010A1530">
let twelve ounces of blood, or even more, if the &s;ubject is replete and robu&s;t, be taken from the arm, on the &s;ide where the pain is. While the vein is open, let the patient re&s;pire &s;trongly, and cough. Bleeding com|monly le&s;&s;ens the pain, and &s;ometimes car|ries it off altogether.</P>
<P>SOME hours after the bleeding, the gly&s;ter No. 11. ought to be given.</P>
<P>FLANNELS dipt in the fomentation No. 12, are to be con&s;tantly applied to the place where the pain is felt; and as it would be trouble&s;ome to apply this topic during the night, a plai&s;ter of Labdanum, &s;pread on leather or linen, may be applied in its room.</P>
<P>IN the morning this plai&s;ter mu&s;t be taken off, the part rubbed with the <HI>ung. altheae</HI> and the medicine No. 12. Let the patient take every half hour, if he be awake, a &s;poonful of the mixture No. 13. and drink after it a warm cupfull of the decoction No. 1. to each pint of which one ounce of honey &s;hould be added.</P>
<P>IT often happens, that the pain, which after bleeding was much le&s;&s;ened, or quite cea&s;ed, returns with as much violence as at fir&s;t: in this ca&s;e a &s;econd bleeding is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, but commonly not &s;o large as the fir&s;t, which always ought to be very copi|ous:
<PB N="21" REF="015100_0020_0F95D327AEFFEFC8">
if after this the pain &s;till returns very &s;en&s;ibly, you mu&s;t bleed a third time, and &s;ometimes even a fourth, according to the violence of the di&s;temper.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t, however, be ob&s;erved, that &s;light remains of pain, and &s;uch as but little impede re&s;piration, do not require fre&s;h bleedings: the Patient might by them be too much weakened, and rendered languid a long time after.</P>
<P>BLEEDING, therefore, mu&s;t only be re|peated in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the pain is vio|lent enough to ob&s;truct the breath con&s;ider|ably; the velocity of the pul&s;e, increa&s;ed commonly at the &s;ame time, &s;hows the ne|ce&s;&s;ity for this evacuation.</P>
<P>IT is a good &s;ign, when the pain changes its place, and affects the clavicles, the &s;houlder-blades, the &s;houlders and back; and that this new pain requires no bleeding. The&s;e changes generally happen about the &s;ixth day: it is then &s;ufficient to chafe the parts in pain lightly, and then anoint them with the <HI>ung. alth.</HI></P>
<P>LET the nouri&s;hment be light, and con|&s;i&s;t of thin broth, roa&s;ted apples, and well fermented bread: the decoction No. 1. or plain barley water with one fourth of new milk, may &s;erve for common drink. If the belly be con&s;tipated, the gly&s;ter No. 11. may be repeated.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="015100_0021_0F95D32966F261F8">As &s;oon as re&s;piration grows ea&s;ier, and the pain is con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, it will be &s;ufficient to give every two hours a &s;poon|ful of No. 13. with a cupfull of the de|coction No. 1. warm after it.</P>
<P>BUT if, notwith&s;tanding &s;everal bleed|ings, the pain continues, without any &s;en|&s;ible diminution; and above all, if the rat|tling of the brea&s;t, and want of expecto|ration &s;hew the lungs to be filling, a bli&s;ter is to be applied to each calf of the leg.</P>
<P>A &s;harp bli&s;ter applied on the painful part has often been attended with very good effects, even when repeated bleedings had procured no ce&s;&s;ation of the pain of the &s;ide.</P>
<P>CARE mu&s;t be taken in this, as well as in all inflammatory di&s;tempers, that the Patient be not kept too hot, and that the air be often renewed.</P>
<P>WHEN the illne&s;s begins to grow milder, by the u&s;e of the above medicines, fre&s;h &s;ymptoms will appear, which &s;how the morbific matter is concocted, and ready to be expelled.</P>
<P>GREAT care mu&s;t then be taken, not to prevent its cour&s;e, but, on the contrary, to facilitate it by all the means that art can &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>BLEEDING piles are of &s;ervice; a white, reddi&s;h, or &s;ometimes a browni&s;h &s;ediment
<PB N="23" REF="015100_0022_0F95D329EAF71988">
in the urine is a favourable &s;ymptom: to encourage its continuance, the &s;ick mu&s;t drink plentifully.</P>
<P>IF in the progre&s;s of the di&s;temper, after the &s;ymptoms grow milder, the excrements are yellow, and bilious, it is a good &s;ign; but at the beginning it affords but a bad progno&s;tic.</P>
<P>IN general this di&s;ea&s;e is carried off by expectoration, e&s;pecially if the excretions are plentiful and dimini&s;h the pleuritic pain, and above all, if they are ripe and re&s;emble pus. Sometimes they are glewy, tenacious, and &s;anguineous; but there is nothing to fear from them, if the pain abates, the fever dimini&s;hes, and re&s;piration becomes more free. Be cautious, however, not to repeat the bleeding, which, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, mu&s;t be prejudicial. Some|times the excretions are yellowi&s;h, and mix|ed with &s;treaks of blood, and this al&s;o is a favourable &s;ign.</P>
<P>LASTLY, it may be laid down as a ge|neral rule, that expectoration is to be e&s;teem|ed a happy &s;ymptom; whenever the excre|tions are thrown off with ea&s;e, they dimini&s;h the pain and fever, and render the re&s;pira|tion ea&s;ier.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a &s;tate of the expectoration, the mixture No. 13. mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide, and the
<PB N="24" REF="015100_0023_0F95D32AAB442430">
linctus No. 14. &s;ub&s;tituted in its place; two &s;poonfuls of which are to be given once in an hour, and lei&s;urely &s;wallowed, with a cup of the decoction No. 1, warm after it.</P>
<P>IF the expectoration does not continue, but &s;uddenly &s;tops, and there comes on a rattling in the brea&s;t, attended with anxiety, the danger is very great; bli&s;ters on the legs mu&s;t be applied immediately, the powder No. 15. be given every four hours, and the warm decoction No. 1. &s;weetened with a little honey, be drank plentifully, till the &s;pitting comes on again, and the brea&s;t is relieved.</P>
<P>THERE comes on &s;ometimes, but not often, a painful &s;welling behind the ears, or on the thighs, which pain is followed by a diminution of that of the brea&s;t: in this ca&s;e, the immediate u&s;e of the catapla&s;m No. 8. or &s;uch like, is nece&s;&s;ary, to ripen the &s;welling, which is to be opened with a lancet, as &s;oon as it comes to a head, and be dre&s;&s;ed afterwards as an ulcer.</P>
<P>THE violence of the di&s;temper may be &s;o great, that the mo&s;t efficacious remedies are in&s;ufficient to overcome it, and to expel the morbific matter. In this ca&s;e, &s;uppu|ration, which is always dangerous, comes on, and mo&s;t commonly the illne&s;s degene|rates into a con&s;umption, unle&s;s means be
<PB N="25" REF="015100_0024_0F95D32B6AC55358">
found to evacuate the already formed pus.</P>
<P>THAT this is the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, may be known by the following &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>THE pain is &s;tubborn, and yet le&s;s violent than at the beginning: it is attended with a dry cough, or with unripe excretions; there is a continual quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e, which encrea&s;es towards night, or when|ever the patient takes any nouri&s;hment; the cheeks and lips become red; he has fre|quent &s;hiverings and night-&s;weats; the urine is frothy and pale, and he &s;oon becomes extremely weak and lean. The ab&s;ce&s;s, formed in the lungs, is &s;ometimes evacuated by excretions; when they begin to appear, and are purulent, the infu&s;ion No. 16. &s;weetened with a little honey, is to be given every hour: broths, in which fre&s;h chervil, lettuce, and par&s;ley roots, are boiled, may &s;erve for nouri&s;hment; and for drink, bar|ley water, with a fourth part of new milk, both to be continued till the purulent mat|ter is quite evacuated.</P>
<P>BUT this does not always happen; the pus is often formed in a bag; and in that ca&s;e it mu&s;t be attempted to draw out this collection of matter.</P>
<P>A SMALL plai&s;ter applied, and made to &s;tick clo&s;ely to the mo&s;t painful place, will be very proper in the beginning of the ill|ne&s;s;
<PB N="26" REF="015100_0025_0F95D32C31C9ED08">
becau&s;e if the Pleuri&s;y &s;hould dege|nerate into an ab&s;ce&s;s, the collection of mat|ter will point towards that place.</P>
<P>WHEN an Ab&s;ce&s;s is known to be form|ed, by the &s;igns that have been de&s;cribed, the marked place is to be corroded by a light cau&s;tic; and when open, care mu&s;t be taken to keep up the &s;uppuration. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, there is rea&s;on to hope, as the re&s;i&s;t|ance is the lea&s;t at this place, that the mat|ter collected will take its cour&s;e, and be di&s;|charged by it; for the&s;e collections are often lodged between the Pleura and the adjacent parts.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on, a &s;eton on the &s;pot is &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed; and the pus has often been &s;een to di&s;charge through &s;uch a pa&s;|&s;age procured by art.</P>
<P>IF the matter contained in the ab&s;ce&s;s can|not be drawn to the external parts, it will occa&s;ion a &s;welling of the Pleura towards the cavity of the brea&s;t; whereby the lungs will be oppre&s;&s;ed, the anxiety daily increa&s;e, the Pleura bur&s;t, all the &s;ymptoms &s;udden|ly di&s;appear, but come on again &s;oon, and the pus fall into the cavity of the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e circum&s;tances, no other method can be u&s;ed but the Paracenthe&s;is, to di&s;charge the brea&s;t from the pus there lodged, and prevent a mortal con&s;umption.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="015100_0026_0F95D32CEB5F7848">DURING this la&s;t trial; the u&s;e of the me|dicine No. 16. is to be continued. If, during the cour&s;e of the di&s;temper, the pa|tient can get no &s;leep, a pint of the emul|&s;ion No. 17. is to be admini&s;tered, to which may occa&s;ionally be added an ounce of the &s;yrup of white poppies, or more if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>PERIPNEUMONY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Di&s;temper is, properly &s;peaking, an inflammation of the lungs: it is dangerous, and even more &s;o than the Pleuri&s;y it&s;elf, which &s;ometimes degenerates into a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ripneumony, when the patient is forced, by exce&s;s of pain, to keep in his breath.</P>
<P>A DIFFICULTY of breathing, the load and oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, and an acute and continual Fever, indicate a Peripneu|mony. In this di&s;temper the patient feels no pain; or if he does complain of any, it is of &s;uch a dull one as di&s;tingui&s;hes the Peripneumony from the Pleuri&s;y; which la&s;t, in in&s;piration, gives the patient a very acute pain.</P>
<P>THE pul&s;e is not &s;o hard in the di&s;ea&s;e we are now de&s;cribing, as in the Pleuri&s;y and other inflammatory di&s;tempers; but, on the contrary, it generally found much &s;ofter.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="015100_0027_0F95D32DADDC5758">IF the Peripneumony is violent, there immediately comes on a great weakne&s;s, the pul&s;e becomes &s;mall, &s;oft, unequal; the re&s;piration is &s;hort, frequent, difficult, and accompanied with a continual cough; the patient cannot lie down for fear of &s;uffoca|tion, but is obliged to &s;it upright in his bed; his face, eyes, tongue, and lips, become red and inflamed: the&s;e &s;ymptoms are fol|lowed by an in&s;upportable anxiety, and &s;oon after by a delirium, and death.</P>
<P>ALL the &s;igns, therefore, that we have recited, give us a very bad progno&s;tic.</P>
<P>A GREATER hardne&s;s in the pul&s;e, a le&s;s difficulty in breathing, more ea&s;e in lying down, le&s;s redne&s;s and &s;welling in the face, the eyes, and the lips, are, on the contrary, favourable &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;temper requires immediate help, for very &s;oon it brings the patient into evi|dent danger.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t begin by a large bleeding in the arm, and repeat it in the &s;ame manner as in a Pleuri&s;y, if the anxiety and difficulty of breathing do not dimini&s;h. If the blood, when drawn, remains fluid and thin, and &s;carce coagulates at all, and if after the bleeding the re&s;piration is not freer, it is a bad &s;ign, which indicates, that the thicker parts are retained in the lungs, and the
<PB N="29" REF="015100_0028_0F95D32E6B74B9B0">
thinner only di&s;charged. In this ca&s;e, a fre&s;h bleeding would produce no effect, and only evacuate that part of the blood which is lea&s;t thick, and could &s;till have made its way thro' the lungs.</P>
<P>SOME hours after the bleeding, it will be proper to give the gly&s;ter No. 11. Fomen|tations, ointments, and plai&s;ters, may be applied to the brea&s;t, but it mu&s;t not be ex|pected that the&s;e &s;ort of things will be attend|ed with as good &s;ucce&s;s as in the Pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>It will be better to apply frequently to the patient's mouth and no&s;trils, a linen or &s;ponge &s;oaked in warm water, the vapours of which may, together with the air, enter by in&s;piration into the lungs.</P>
<P>THE diet ought, as in the Pleuri&s;y, to be extremely light, and the broths &s;till thinner.</P>
<P>Let the common drink be the decoction No. 1. or barley-water; but in&s;tead of mix|ing milk with it, add to each pint half an ounce of pure honey.</P>
<P>WHILE the patient is awake, let him take every half hour a &s;poonful of No. 13. and drink after it a warm cup of the decoc|tion No. 1.</P>
<P>IF, on the u&s;e of the&s;e medicines, the anxiety dimini&s;hes, the re&s;piration becomes freer, the Fever le&s;s violent, the pul&s;e more vigorous and equal, the tongue moi&s;t, and
<PB N="30" REF="015100_0029_0F95D32F2D02F6E8">
every part of the body, even to the extre|mities, of an equal heat; if, above all, the &s;kin is moi&s;t and &s;oft, we may hope for the be&s;t, and nothing more is required than a continuance of the &s;ame means, as the in|flammation of the lungs is beginning to be re&s;olved, and gradually to decline.</P>
<P>BUT things &s;eldom take this turn, unle&s;s the di&s;temper is not violent, the &s;olid parts are &s;upple, and relief has been applied from the beginning. It oftner happens, that the matter of this Di&s;ea&s;e is evacuated by expec|toration.</P>
<P>The &s;pitting mu&s;t, therefore, be carefully attended to; and it is a very bad &s;ign, when at the &s;ame time the patient does not expec|torate at all, and has a difficulty to breathe, with a rattling in his throat. The &s;pittings are good, if di&s;charged &s;peedily, copiou&s;ly, and ea&s;ily. They &s;hould be of a proper con|&s;i&s;tence; &s;ometimes they appear yellow, and &s;treaked with a little blood; which ought to give no unea&s;ine&s;s, for excretions of this &s;ort are always good, and grow white in time.</P>
<P>THE effect they produce is remarkable, by the diminution of anxiety, the freedom of re&s;piration, and the alteration in the pul&s;e, which grows &s;tronger and fuller.</P>
<P>LET the patient, at that time, take two
<PB N="31" REF="015100_0030_0F95D32FEC0E1380">
tea-&s;poonfuls of the linctus No. 14. and after &s;wallowing them &s;oftly, drink a cup of the warm decoction No. 1.</P>
<P>NOTHING more is to be done under the&s;e circum&s;tances; and bleeding, purging, or exciting &s;weats, would be detrimental.</P>
<P>WE ought chiefly to guard again&s;t the cold air, and cold drinks, for either the one or the other will &s;top the expectoration, and thereby throw the patient into imminent danger.</P>
<P>IF a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pitting &s;hould happen, and the anxiety be followed by the rattling of the throat, bli&s;ters are to be ap|plied to the legs, the powder No. 15. is to be given every four hours, and the &s;ame de|coction No. 1. be u&s;ed as was ordered for the Pleuri&s;y. The patient is al&s;o to in&s;pire by the mouth and no&s;trils the vapour of warm water.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens, that, during the cour&s;e of the di&s;temper, the patient voids by &s;tool a yellow and bilious matter, and is re|lieved by it. This is al&s;o a favourable &s;ign, as has been ob&s;erved, in &s;peaking of the Pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>A LARGE and thick &s;ediment in the urine, at fir&s;t red, afterwards turning white, is likewi&s;e a good &s;ymptom. When this happens, the patient mu&s;t drink plentifully
<PB N="32" REF="015100_0031_0F95D330AE2E8668">
as in the Pleuri&s;y. Neverthele&s;s, it rarely happens that the cau&s;e of the evil is di&s;|charged merely by urine; the &s;pitting, which generally comes on about the &s;ame time, contributes greatly to the entire cure.</P>
<P>WHEN the patient, by the means of the&s;e evacuations, begins to find his brea&s;t di&s;en|gaged, he may have his broth &s;omewhat &s;tronger; but he &s;hould con&s;tantly take but little at a time and often, that the lungs may not afre&s;h be overcharged by a chyle, both too crude and too copious. Sometimes a plentiful bleeding of the no&s;e gives relief to the patient; but this &s;eldom happens.</P>
<P>IF none of the evacuations here de&s;cribed are ob&s;erved within the &s;pace of a fortnight, if the Fever continues pretty &s;trong, and the Cough dry; if the heat extends to the ex|tremities of the body; if the pul&s;e is quick, &s;oft, and wavering; if a difficulty of breath|ing and &s;hiverings accompany the&s;e &s;ymp|toms; if the cheeks and lips are red, the thir&s;t great, and, la&s;tly, the Fever &s;tronger towards night, it is certain that the inflam|mation is turning to an Ab&s;ce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE indications of an Ab&s;ce&s;s already formed in the lungs, be&s;ides the &s;ymptoms already de&s;cribed, are as follow: A dry continual ob&s;tinate cough, which increa&s;es when the &s;ick moves, or takes any nouri&s;h|ment;
<PB N="33" REF="015100_0032_0F95D3316D2DF2D0">
he can only lie on the affected &s;ide, without its being po&s;&s;ible for him to lie on the other; he has periodically a little con|tinued Fever, which augments whenever he eats, drinks, or &s;tirs, and is attended with a redne&s;s of the lips and cheeks; he has no appetite, but a violent thir&s;t, and complains of night-&s;weats, e&s;pecially of the head, and the upper part of the brea&s;t; the urine is &s;pumous, he is greatly emaciated, and extremely weak.</P>
<P>WHILE the Ab&s;ce&s;s remains whole, the purulent tumor increa&s;es more and more; it pre&s;&s;es upon tho&s;e parts of the lungs which as yet are found; it ob&s;tructs the re&s;piration, and, after the mo&s;t terrible anxieties, &s;uffo|cates the patient.</P>
<P>IT is therefore e&s;&s;ential, that the Ab&s;ce&s;s &s;hould break, and be maturated, in order that the pus be evacuated. But it may happen to break in &s;uch a manner, as to di&s;per&s;e the matter into the brea&s;t, and occa&s;ion an Em|pyema, which almo&s;t always proves mor|tal. This is known to be the ca&s;e, by the &s;udden diminution of all the &s;ymptoms, &s;ometimes attended with &s;light faintings, and the total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of purulent &s;pittings. It is becau&s;e the Ab&s;ce&s;s is in effect bur&s;t, that the &s;ymptoms proceeding from the di&s;|tention of the purulent bag immediately
<PB N="34" REF="015100_0033_0F95D3322C629C20">
cea&s;e; but the matter &s;pread in the cavity of the brea&s;t, growing every day more co|pious, and more acrid, &s;oon occa&s;ions new &s;ymptoms, wor&s;e than the preceding ones.</P>
<P>THE Paracenthe&s;is is the only means of help le&s;t; but as the ulcer has already cor|roded the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs, the &s;uc|ce&s;s will be very doubtful: and even tho' the pus is evacuated, the &s;ick per&s;on gene|rally dies after the operation.</P>
<P>MUCH more is it to be wi&s;hed, that the Ab&s;ce&s;s may break in &s;uch a manner, as to let the pus fall into the bronchi or air ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, that &s;o it may be evacuated by &s;pitting.</P>
<P>WHEN this happens, it is to be feared, le&s;t the bronchi be totally filled and &s;topped by the quantity of pus &s;preading it&s;elf in|&s;tantly, and all at once, and occa&s;ioning thereby a &s;uffocation: but if the pus that falls in the&s;e ve&s;&s;els can &s;till be di&s;charged, the patient often recovers, tho' the purulent con&s;umption is always to be apprehended.</P>
<P>THE following are the principal, &s;uccours which art has found out to forward the open|ing of the Ab&s;ce&s;s into the bronchi, and the evacuation of the pus by expectoration.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;ymptoms of an Ab&s;ce&s;s, as de&s;cribed above, are perceived, let the &s;ick in&s;pire continually by the mouth and
<PB N="35" REF="015100_0034_0F95D332EDC15548">
no&s;trils the vapour of warm water, to &s;often and relax the parts.</P>
<P>LET him take fatter broth, and in larger quantity than before, that the &s;tomach being filled, the de&s;cent of the diaphragm may be more difficult, and the Ab&s;ce&s;s more com|pre&s;&s;ed. The patient mu&s;t be excited to cough, by applying warm vinegar to his no&s;trils, or to cry with a loud voice. This may procure a chance of breaking the Ab&s;ce&s;s, which, if the &s;trength of the &s;ick per&s;on can bear it, may be &s;till forwarded by giving him an airing in a carriage, on a rough road, where he may be well &s;hook.</P>
<P>AS it is impo&s;&s;ible to know exactly the moment when the Ab&s;ce&s;s will break, you mu&s;t repeat, from time to time, the at|tempts here de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>IF, when the Ab&s;ce&s;s is broke, the ex|cretions are purulent, white, and &s;mooth; if the fever di&s;appears, or dimini&s;hes con&s;i|derably; if the appetite returns, the thir&s;t cea&s;es, and, la&s;tly, the excrements are &s;olid and natural, there is rea&s;on to hope that the &s;ick will recover.</P>
<P>IF, on the contrary, the excretions are &s;tained of different colours, with a bad &s;mell; if the fever doth not cea&s;e, or, hav|ing cea&s;ed, returns again; if the thir&s;t re|mains,
<PB N="36" REF="015100_0035_0F95D333AA703260">
and the appetite doth not increa&s;e, it is to be feared the patient will &s;ink under it.</P>
<P>WHEN the Ab&s;ce&s;s of the lungs di&s;|charges it&s;elf by means of purulent ex|cretions, a little rice, or oats boiled in milk, affords an excellent nouri&s;hment; but care mu&s;t be taken, that the &s;ick take not too much at once, but little and often.</P>
<P>THE infu&s;ion No. 15. with a third part milk and a little honey, will be a proper drink. He is to take thrice a day the pow|der No. 18. and as the lungs have been fa|tigued by a continual cough during the day, &s;ome relaxation ought to be procured in the night; wherefore let the patient take two pills No. 19.</P>
<P>IF he is &s;omewhat co&s;tive, it is not ami&s;s, but if he remains &s;o &s;everal days, the gly&s;ter No. 11. is to be given. If the excretions dimini&s;h little by little, appetite comes on, &s;trength increa&s;es, and the patient gets rid of his fever, a quick cure may be expected.</P>
<P>WHEN the excretions are con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened, the powder No. 18. and infu&s;ion No. 16. are no more to be u&s;ed; in&s;tead of which, three &s;mall &s;poonfuls of the linctus No. 20. and after it three cups of the infu|&s;ion No. 21. may be taken thrice a-day.</P>
<P>IF, notwith&s;tanding this, the cough re|turns
<PB N="37" REF="015100_0036_0F95D3346AE049B0">
&s;tronger towards night, the patient may continue to take the pills No. 19. which otherwi&s;e are al&s;o to be le&s;t off.</P>
<P>IF, after the Ab&s;ce&s;s in the lungs hath begun to be evacuated by excretion, this evacuation &s;hould &s;uddenly &s;top, an extreme anxiety &s;ucceeds, together with a rattling in the brea&s;t, and the &s;ick is in very imminent danger. This accident is commonly cau&s;ed by the imprudent admi&s;&s;ion of cold air, or by &s;ome violent emotion of the mind, as anger, fear, or &s;uch like.</P>
<P>A SPEEDY relief mu&s;t be given, by cau&s;ing the patient to in&s;pire the vapour of warm water, both by the mouth and no&s;|trils, making him drink freely of the warm infu&s;ion No. 16. and giving him every four hours the powder No. 13. until the brea&s;t be di&s;engaged, and expectoration comes on again; after which the u&s;e of the powder is to be di&s;continued.</P>
<P>IT will be of &s;ervice to apply bli&s;ters to the calves of the legs, as has been recom|mended in the Pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>WHEN the purulent matter is re&s;orbed by the veins, it &s;ometimes occa&s;ions a &s;ud|den depo&s;it of matter in other parts of the body, and there cau&s;es an ab&s;ce&s;s, viz. about the ears, the arms, or thighs. The load of the brea&s;t cea&s;es at the &s;ame time; and
<PB N="38" REF="015100_0037_0F95D3361F9F3318">
the &s;ame remedies are to be u&s;ed, and the &s;ame rules ob&s;erved, as in the ca&s;e of an Ab&s;ce&s;s after a Pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>AS the inflammations of the external parts may degenerate into &s;chirrous hard|ne&s;&s;es, the &s;ame accident is to be feared in inflammations of the internal parts: for af|ter a Peripneumony, there &s;ometimes re|mains in the lungs a &s;chirrous and callous hardne&s;s, in which ca&s;e there is al|mo&s;t always an adhe&s;ion to the Pleura. Re&s;piration continues in that ca&s;e difficult for the re&s;t of life, attended with a little cough, chiefly after meals, and after exer|ci&s;e; and there is no appearance of any of the indications of an Ab&s;ce&s;s we have been de&s;cribing. This accident can rarely be got the better of; and the little relief that may be afforded is &s;carce to be expected in a military life, unle&s;s it be for the cavalry, by riding on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>LASTLY, if the Peripneumony be &s;o violent, that the remedies have no effect, gangrene and death are the con&s;equence. This is fore&s;een, when the patient labours with intolerable anxiety, falling into ex|treme and &s;udden faintne&s;&s;es, with an un|equal, feeble, and very quick pul&s;e, and the excretions without con&s;i&s;tence, &s;tinking and black. All the&s;e &s;igns indicate a &s;peedy and inevitable death.</P>

<HEAD>RHEUMATISM, and RHEUMATIC PAINS.</HEAD>
<P>THE general cau&s;e of the Rheumati&s;m is the &s;udden expo&s;ition of the body to the cold after being con&s;iderably heated, either by work or the weather; e&s;|pecially if a per&s;on, being overcome by the heat, throws off his cloaths, and re&s;ts him|&s;elf in a damp and cold place,</P>
<P>THE &s;oldier is mo&s;t frequently liable to this di&s;order, when heated by fatigue, and expo&s;ed to rain, he is obliged to wear his wet cloaths, without changing them.</P>
<P>THE cold nights, which in Spring and Autumn &s;ucceed very warm days, are al&s;o a cau&s;e of the Rheumati&s;m. This di&s;temper begins with an univer&s;al &s;hivering, followed by heat, thir&s;t, unea&s;ine&s;s and fever. After a day or two, and even &s;ometimes &s;ooner, the patient feels a &s;harp pain, not confined to one place, but moving from one limb to another, viz. at the wri&s;ts, the &s;houlders, the knees; and &s;o different parts of the bo|dy are in this manner &s;ucce&s;sfully affected; and the articulations, that are attacked, be|come red and &s;welled.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, in this di&s;order, the ten|dinous expan&s;ions covering the mu&s;cles are
<PB N="40" REF="015100_0039_0F95D3376DCF2C40">
attacked, and occa&s;ion an exce&s;&s;ive pain off the lea&s;t motion of the part affected. Some|times the Fever cea&s;es in a few days, though the pain continues. In general, it is a very trouble&s;ome di&s;order, e&s;pecially when it attacks the loins, as the &s;ick is then con|fined to a &s;upine po&s;ture, without motion, and, as it were, like a log. It often pa&s;&s;es from the loins to the hips, or upper joints of the thighs; where, if it remains long fixed, the cure becomes very difficult.</P>
<P>WHEN the pain &s;uddenly and often changes from place to place, it is to be feared that the cau&s;e of the illne&s;s will be drove inwardly, and attack the lungs or brain, which would be attended with the greate&s;t danger. This accident is di&s;co|vered by a delirium, or a violent oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, &s;ucceeding a ce&s;&s;ation of pain in the extremities.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e is &s;eldom mortal; but the violence of the pains, and their continua|tion upon an improper treatment, induce us to employ quick and efficacious reme|dies. When the di&s;order is neglected, it often happens, that the articulations are de|prived of motion, and there remains for life an incurable &s;tiffne&s;s of the joint. <HI>(Anchylo&s;is.)</HI></P>
<P>THE method of treatment is as follows,</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="015100_0040_0F95D3382C74B4F0">TAKE ten ounces of blood from the arm of the affected &s;ide.</P>
<P>LET flannels, imbibed in the warm fo|mentation No. 12. be con&s;tantly applied to the part in pain.</P>
<P>THE diet ought to be light, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall broth, with decoctions of barley, oats, or rice, and with roa&s;ted apples.</P>
<P>FOR common drink, u&s;e the decoction No. 1. or barley-water with a fourth part milk.</P>
<P>Two &s;poonfuls of the mixture No. 22. with a cupfull of the infu&s;ion No. 23. warm, may be given every hour, unle&s;s the pa|tient be a&s;leep.</P>
<P>THE following day let him have the gly&s;ter No. 11. and con&s;tantly continue the medicines No. 22. and 23.</P>
<P>IF the pain does not give way, and the Fever continues, the bleeding is to be re|peated the next day, the fomentation No. 12. and the medicines No. 22. and 23. are to be continued; after which, the follow|ing morning, let the patient take the purge No. 6. omitting during this day the u&s;e of No. 22. and 23. and taking at night the anodyne draught No. 24. Let him after|wards continue two days longer the u&s;e of No. 22. and 23. and on the third day re|peat
<PB N="42" REF="015100_0041_0F95D338F1143968">
the purge No. 6. and at night the draught No. 24.</P>
<P>BY this method, we commonly get the better of this di&s;order. If a good deal of a brick coloured &s;ediment appears in the urine, attended with a general breathing &s;weat, it is a good &s;ign.</P>
<P>IT will then be &s;ufficient to compleat the cure, to keep the patient warm in bed, and make him take the decoction No. 23.</P>
<P>BUT if, after the u&s;e of the&s;e remedies, the pain &s;till continues, and the part af|fected grows red, leeches are to be applied upon it.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the Fever cea&s;es, the patient appears recovered, but the pain &s;till roves from one joint to another: in this ca&s;e, let the patient take half a drachm of Venice &s;oap made into pills, morning, noon, and night, drinking after it &s;ix ounces of the infu&s;ion No 23. made warm. He mu&s;t be kept from the cold, and the articulations lightly rubbed with a piece of dry flannel.</P>
<P>IT happens likewi&s;e &s;ometimes, that the patient, tho' otherwi&s;e recovered, has a fixed pain le&s;t about the articulation of the hip. Apply in that ca&s;e a bli&s;ter, about the &s;ize of a crown piece, upon the part for twelve hours, then take it off, and
<PB N="43" REF="015100_0042_0F95D339AB073E58">
pierce the bladder it has rai&s;ed, that the lymph ama&s;&s;ed may flow out, and cure the wound by means of the plai&s;ter, called <HI>empl. allum coctum.</HI></P>
<P>EIGHT days after the place where the bli&s;ter was applied is healed, apply another, and proceed as before, and if the pain is then not entirely vani&s;hed, this operation may be repeated four times. Ob&s;erve, when you take off the bli&s;ter, only to pierce the ve&s;icle, and not take the epidermis, for the place thus made bare, would be extremely painful, and without any advance towards the cure.</P>
<P>THOSE who have &s;uffered of this di&s;or|der in Autumn, mu&s;t take care, during the following winter, not to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the cold, and the injuries of the &s;ea&s;on, for they would certainly have a relap&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN by the pain continuing long fixed in the &s;ame place, the affected articulation begins to &s;tiffen, let the part be twice a day held over the &s;team of hot water, then well wiped with hot linen, lightly rubbed, and anointed with <HI>ung. altheae.</HI></P>

<HEAD>INTERMITTING FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>A FEVER is known by a quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e, u&s;ually attended with la&s;&s;itude, languor, weakne&s;s, thir&s;t, and &s;eve|ral other &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>WHEN after a fit of &s;everal hours, it &s;en|&s;ibly dimini&s;hes, with all its &s;ymptoms, and at la&s;t ab&s;olutely cea&s;es, but in &s;uch a manner as to return again, it is called an Intermitting Fever.</P>
<P>THIS Fever has different appellations, according to the length of the interval be|tween the &s;its.</P>
<P>IF it returns every day, it is called a Quotidian; if there is a day between each fit, it is called a Tertian; if the return is after two days free, it is named a Quartan.</P>
<P>THE Intermitting Fever comes on with gaping, la&s;&s;itude, debility, colds, &s;hiver|ings, tremblings, palene&s;s of the extremi|ties, anxieties, &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;ometimes vo|mitting. The pul&s;e is feeble and &s;mall and the thir&s;t pretty great. Heat &s;ucceeds af|ter &s;ome time; it in&s;en&s;ibly augments till it becomes extreme. The body then grows red, the anxiety dimini&s;hes, the pul&s;e is fuller and &s;tronger, the thir&s;t exce&s;&s;ive, and the patient complains of a violent headach,
<PB N="45" REF="015100_0044_0F95D33B2CF5BC30">
and pain in all his limbs; la&s;tly, a general &s;weat &s;ucceeds; all the de&s;cribed &s;ymptoms dimini&s;h, and the patient often falls into a &s;leep, after which he wakes without Fever, his pul&s;e is natural, and there remains no|thing but la&s;&s;itude, and weakne&s;s. Some|times during the hot fit of the Fever; bilious matters are thrown up with a per|ception of relief.</P>
<P>THE urine after the Fever, or during the &s;weat, is reddi&s;h and frothy; and as &s;oon as it is cold, there appears on the top a peli|cle, adhering to the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el, at the bottom of which is depo&s;ed a &s;ediment, in colour re&s;embling pounded brick or bole ar|moniac.</P>
<P>THIS appearance is, however, &s;eldom ob&s;erved in any other but autumnal inter|mittent fevers, and it is more &s;o after &s;eve|ral paroxy&s;ms. In the &s;pring Intermittents, the urine is commonly le&s;s red, and rather yellowi&s;h, a cloud forms in the middle, and it depo&s;es a white &s;ediment, which is a good &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>OF the two &s;pecies of Intermitting Fe|vers we have ju&s;t mentioned, the vernal ones are ea&s;ier cured than the autumnal ones, which are attended with more trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>THE Intermittents which prevail from
<PB N="46" REF="015100_0045_0F95D33BEEC027A8">
February to July, are called Vernal; and tho&s;e that begin in the latter end of July, or beginning of Augu&s;t, and cea&s;e at the end of January, or &s;ometimes &s;ooner, are called Autumnal Intermittents.</P>
<P>AFTER the long and violent heats of the &s;ummer, if the troops have been much fa|tigued, there will be many Autumnal Fevers, and of the mo&s;t dangerous kind, e&s;pecially if the military operations require camping in mar&s;hy places.</P>
<P>IN September and October the number of the&s;e Fevers is commonly very con&s;ider|able, but there is great hope to &s;ee that number dimini&s;h at the fall of the leaf, e&s;|pecially if the winds blow any thing hard.</P>
<P>AS there is a great difference between the Spring and Autumn Fevers, and as the method of treating them often differ much, we &s;hall treat &s;eparately of each.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SPRING INTERMITTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>SPRING Intermittents are generally Ter|tians, very often of a kindly &s;ort; &s;ome|times double Tertians, but &s;eldomer than in Autumn.</P>
<P>WE call that Fever a double Tertian, where a fre&s;h paroxy&s;m comes on every
<PB N="47" REF="015100_0046_0F95D33CACE6F6F0">
day, but the fit is generally &s;lighter on the alternate days.</P>
<P>DURING the paroxy&s;m, it will be &s;uffi|cient to take a large quantity of any dilut|ing liquor, made agreeable to the palate, but always warm, &s;ince cold draughts would be hurtful.</P>
<P>THE patient may therefore drink of the pti&s;an No. 25. keeping him&s;elf quiet and in a moderate degree of heat.</P>
<P>THE fit mo&s;t commonly goes off by an univer&s;al &s;weat, which mu&s;t be kept up by warm drink, but ought not to be rendered exce&s;&s;ive by too much covering, or other means that provoke heat.</P>
<P>JUST at this time, viz. on the going off of the fit, or as &s;oon as it is over, the pa|tient mu&s;t have a me&s;s of broth with &s;ome lemon juice, or cream of tartar in it, to make it acid.</P>
<P>THE intermediate days that are free from Fever, he may take food &s;omewhat more &s;olid, viz. a little meat, provided the fle&s;h be of young animals: beef will not hurt, &s;o it be but tender, but all &s;orts of fat are to be avoided.</P>
<P>NOTHING is to be eat near the time that the return of the paroxy&s;m is expected; the nouri&s;hment then taken would load the &s;to|mach
<PB N="48" REF="015100_0047_0F95D33D6B82D6F8">
during the fit, and cau&s;e a bad di|ge&s;tion.</P>
<P>FOUR hours, however, before the fit, the patient may take &s;ome light broth. As in &s;pring Agues, the paroxy&s;ms commonly an|ticipate the time they &s;hould return at, regard mu&s;t be had thereto in the taking of nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>IF the day the patient is without Fever be &s;erene, it will be proper for him to u&s;e a little exerci&s;e; but not to la&s;&s;itude; he ought likewi&s;e to endeavour to &s;leep rather more than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>IT is to be remarked, that tho&s;e &s;pring Agues often turn to inflammatory di&s;orders, e&s;pecially in young and &s;anguine &s;ubjects: bleeding is therefore proper, e&s;pecially if the &s;ick have a redne&s;s in the face, a vio|lent head-ach, or feel &s;ome pain on the &s;ide of the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>IF attended with frequent flatulent erup|tions, if the tongue is charged, a bitter ta&s;te in the mouth, or a light vertigo, it will be proper to give him an emetic.</P>
<P>LET him take four hours before the re|turn of the fit the powder No. 26. or No. 27. if of a weaker con&s;titution, as &s;oon as he &s;hall have vomited, let him drink warm water plentifully; he will &s;oon throw it up, and vomit afre&s;h; he then mu&s;t repeat his
<PB N="49" REF="015100_0048_0F95D33E2E21D080">
drinking, and go on in this manner till what is to be thrown off his &s;tomach, be diluted, and his vomiting made ea&s;y.</P>
<P>AFTER vomiting &s;everal times, the wa|ter drank commonly &s;tays one hour: after the vomiting hath cea&s;ed, let the patient have the potion No. 24. and &s;o wait for the paroxy&s;m, during which let him take the pti&s;an No. 25. ob&s;erving the rules before laid down.</P>
<P>IF he complains of pains cro&s;s his back, of grumbling or wind in his bowels, if his belly is &s;welled or hard, he mu&s;t be purged in the following manner.</P>
<P>EIGHT hours before the return of the fit, let him take the purge No. 28. and &s;ix hours after he hath taken it, that is, two hours before the fit, give him the draught No. 24.</P>
<P>IF the &s;ymptoms, that gave occa&s;ion to the purge, or the vomit, continue, the&s;e remedies may be repeated, which however is but &s;eldom the ca&s;e in &s;pring Fevers.</P>
<P>OBSERVE, that &s;ometimes emetics do not evacuate only by vomit, but by &s;tool al&s;o, and that purges act likewi&s;e &s;ometimes by vomit. There is nothing to be feared when this happens, &s;ince the only object of the&s;e remedies is to evacuate the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines. After the bowels are thus
<PB N="50" REF="015100_0049_0F95D33EEDC6A4A8">
clean&s;ed, let the patient take every two hours a &s;poonful of the mixture No. 29. drinking after it a cup of camomile flower tea. This remedy mu&s;t not be u&s;ed in the paroxy&s;m, but only whil&s;t the patient is without Fever, nor &s;hould he be waked to take it.</P>
<P>THIS is the method of treating Spring Fevers: and there is &s;eldom a nece&s;&s;ity for u&s;ing the bark.</P>
<P>IF after the third or fourth paroxy&s;m, ulcerated pu&s;tules break out about the no&s;e or lips, it is a good &s;ign, and the fever quickly cea&s;es: but this is not &s;o &s;ure in Autumnal Fevers.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens, tho' rarely, that after &s;even or eight fits, the Spring Fever does not cea&s;e, nor even con&s;iderably di|mini&s;h, and that, on the contrary, the fit become longer and &s;tronger. This is par|ticularly the ca&s;e, where the patients are &s;ubject to &s;weat copiou&s;ly, as &s;oon as they are in bed. Here the bark becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>LET him take every three hours while the Fever is off, one of the powders No. 30. in &s;ome wine.</P>
<P>THIS method will &s;oon complete the cure; and as in the &s;pring the weather grows better every day, there is but little fear of a relap&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>AUTUMNAL INTERMITTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Fevers are more ob&s;tinate than tho&s;e in the &s;pring; and of the&s;e the wor&s;t &s;ort happen commonly after a very hot &s;ummer.</P>
<P>THEY are al&s;o harder to be known; for when they fir&s;t begin, the fits are &s;o long, and the returns &s;o frequent, that they &s;eem continued Fevers, with little or no inter|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the Fever abates a little, and then returns in a few hours, after a light &s;hivering. It is only when it begins to give way its character is fir&s;t known; it then appears that the di&s;order is a true in|termittent. The&s;e Fevers, which at fir&s;t appear to be continued, often degenerate into Quartans.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the&s;e Fevers, which in the beginning did intermit, after long and re|doubled paroxy&s;ms, are changed into dan|gerous continued Fevers.</P>
<P>THESE Fevers are always bilious; the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines are filled with putrid matter, which mu&s;t be di&s;charged without delay; to po&s;tpone it would be detrimental.</P>
<P>LET the patient take the emetic No. 26. or 27, having regard, on this occa&s;ion, to
<PB N="52" REF="015100_0051_0F95D340707BC610">
what has been &s;aid on the &s;ubject of inter|mitting Spring Fevers.</P>
<P>IF the &s;kin of the face is tight and red, the eyes inflamed, and the heat great and general throughout the body, a bleeding mu&s;t precede the vomit.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, if the face is &s;hrunk and pale, and the pul&s;e not full, bleeding would hurt, and mu&s;t be refrained from.</P>
<P>THE vomit mu&s;t be given in the inter|mi&s;&s;ion of the Fever; or if it does not cea&s;e entirely, that in&s;tant is to be cho&s;en when it is lea&s;t violent.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES al&s;o, in an Autumnal Fe|ver, it is nece&s;&s;ary to repeat the vomit, that is, when the nau&s;eous &s;ickne&s;s, the bitter ta&s;te of the mouth, and the foulne&s;s of the tongue, continue.</P>
<P>THE day the patient takes no vomit, let him drink the decoction No. 25. adding an ounce of the oxymel No. 31. to every pint of the decoction.</P>
<P>AFTER the fir&s;t or &s;econd vomit, the powder No. 32. is to be taken every four hours.</P>
<P>THIS method will commonly &s;ucceed in the&s;e Fevers; and if before, they were con|tinued, they will become intermittent, &s;o that there will be a con&s;iderable interval from one paroxy&s;m to another, let the pa|tient

<HEAD>THE DROPSY.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the aqueous part of the blood is ama&s;&s;ed together, and retained in any cavity of the body greater or le&s;s, this di&s;ea&s;e is called a Drop&s;y.</P>
<P>THE denominations of it are different, according to the parts of the body affected.</P>
<P>IF the water is detained in the adipo&s;e membrane, and thereby cau&s;es a general &s;welling, it is called <HI>Ana&s;arca.</HI> The &s;wel|ling generally begins in the inferior parts, and gains in&s;en&s;ibly the whole body; the eyes are languid, the face and body &s;allow, the urine in &s;mall quantity, and the patient never &s;weats. On pre&s;&s;ing the &s;welled part, it pits. The &s;welled parts, and chiefly the thighs and feet, are always very cold.</P>
<P>IT is common enough in the Army for this di&s;ea&s;e to &s;ucceed Intermitting Fevers of long duration, e&s;pecially in autumn and winter. The &s;oldier is al&s;o &s;ubject to it, when after having &s;uddenly drank a quanti|ty of cold water, he re&s;ts him&s;elf in a cold place: it is al&s;o frequently the con&s;equence
<PB N="59" REF="015100_0058_0F95D3466B369B58">
of a con&s;iderable lo&s;s of blood, either from wounds, or bleedings too often repeated.</P>
<P>WHEN the Ana&s;arca comes on after a long Intermittent Fever, evacuations are not extremely nece&s;&s;ary; but it is common|ly cured by giving thrice a day, viz. in the morning fa&s;ting, one hour before dinner, and one hour before &s;upper, two ounces of the prepared wine No. 38.</P>
<P>TO fini&s;h the cure, the patient mu&s;t be kept warm, either by the natural heat of the air, or by an artificial one; he ought to be well covered in the night, keep to dry food, &s;uch as meat or fi&s;h roa&s;ted; his drink &s;hould be little and pure, and as much exerci&s;e be u&s;ed as his &s;trength will admit of.</P>
<P>IT will be found u&s;eful to rub the &s;welled parts with warm flannels, as often as you can. If the patient voids urine in larger quantity, and begins to &s;weat in bed, and the &s;welled parts come down, it is a very favourable &s;ign.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;welling hath di&s;appeared, there remains &s;uch a relaxation in the parts as threaten a relap&s;e; this may be prevented by cau&s;ing the patient to wear his cloaths &s;traiter than u&s;ual, and rolling his legs and thighs with bandages. Bodily exerci&s;e in the open air, and warm weather, does infinite good.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="015100_0059_0F95D3472C74B8D8">IN this manner generally the Ana&s;arca that fucceeds Intermittent Fevers is cured happily enough. But when this di&s;temper proceeds from other cau&s;es, it often is more ob&s;tinate, and requires large evacuations of the &s;erous humour. Many ways are tried to procure the&s;e evacuations, but experience &s;hews the remedy No. 39. to be &s;ure and efficacious. The patient is to take a &s;poon|ful of this in the morning; or if, as it &s;ome|times does, it brings on a vomiting, only half a &s;poonful. The mo&s;t common effect is, however only a &s;imple &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE urine after the u&s;e of this remedy comes away in large quantity, and affords a con&s;iderable relief. It &s;eldom purges; but if it &s;hould, does no harm.</P>
<P>THIS medicine is to be taken every day, till all the &s;ero&s;ities are evacuated, and the &s;welling of the body entirely come down. If the do&s;e is not efficacious enough in robu&s;t con&s;titutions, it &s;hould be in&s;en&s;ibly aug|mented till it procures a large di&s;charge by urine. When the patient is on the recovery, the &s;ame regimen mu&s;t be ob&s;erved as has been ju&s;t de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the extrava&s;ated lymph is accumulated in the lower belly, and the quantity increa&s;es &s;o much as to cau&s;e it to &s;well exce&s;&s;ively. When &s;o, by pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="61" REF="015100_0060_0F95D347EDB67038">
with one hand on one &s;ide of the belly, and &s;triking on the other with the other hand, the fluctuation is felt, and water is found to abound.</P>
<P>WHEN the di&s;temper is recent, it is cured often enough only by the u&s;e of the remedy No. 39. but if the flux of urine does not come on in &s;ome days, nor the &s;welling of the belly dimini&s;h, ha&s;te mu&s;t be made to draw off the water by the punc|ture. The operation is &s;afe, and &s;ure e|nough; but if attempted when the di&s;ea&s;e is more inveterate, it is le&s;s efficacious.</P>
<P>IT will be proper, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to draw off all the water all together at once; which may be done &s;afely, by &s;traiten|ing the patient's belly with a bandage, by little and little, and more and more, as the water runs off: the faintings and other accidents will, by this means, be avoided.</P>
<P>AFTER the evacuation procured by the puncture, the belly mu&s;t be bound tight with rollers, and the patient ob&s;erve the diet we have de&s;cribed above.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e of the remedy No. 38. will be very proper here. Sometimes the belly &s;wells again, and the puncture is then to be repeated.</P>
<P>AS it &s;ometimes, though but rarely, happens, that the &s;welling of the belly is
<PB N="62" REF="015100_0061_0F95D348ADB43DB8">
cau&s;ed only by wind, and not at all by a collection of lymph, the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention mu&s;t be u&s;ed in ob&s;erving what the ca&s;e is, becau&s;e in this la&s;t the punc|ture is &s;carce ever of u&s;e, and, on the con|trary, generally accelerates death.</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t di&s;ea&s;e is called <HI>Tympanites,</HI> or Drop&s;y of the Belly.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. GENERALLY the belly is not &s;o ex|ce&s;&s;ively &s;welled as in the Drop&s;y.</P>
<P N="2">2d. THE belly appears elevated before, and depre&s;&s;ed on the lateral parts.</P>
<P N="3">3d. WHEN the belly is &s;truck, the mo|tion of water is not felt, but it gives a &s;ound &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of a drum.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Tho' the &s;ick lie on either of his &s;ides, the form of the belly remains the &s;ame, the &s;kin of which is white, extend|ed, and ela&s;tic.</P>
<P N="5">5th. COSTIVENESS, and gripings about the navel, often precede this di&s;temper.</P>
<P N="6">6th. THE body of the patient is lighter than in a Drop&s;y of the Belly, where the collection of water con&s;iderably augments the weight.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, this di&s;temper is more dangerous than the other, and is often mortal.</P>
<P>THE cure may be attempted in the fol|lowing manner. Let the patient's belly be
<PB N="63" REF="015100_0062_0F95D3496C317230">
rubbed with flannel, for a quarter of an hour at a time, twice a day; and after each friction, let it be anointed with the li|niment No. 40. and for &s;everal days let him at night take the powder No. 41.</P>
<P>If the wind begin to pa&s;s by the anus, and the belly grows le&s;s, there is room to hope a cure.</P>
<P>It happens &s;ometimes, that the lymph collects in the cavity of the brea&s;t; and it has been often ob&s;erved, that &s;oldiers are &s;ubject to this kind of Drop&s;y, when, after having been heated by work, and all in a &s;weat, they &s;uddenly expo&s;e them&s;elves to the cold, and greedily drink cold water.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is known by the preceding cau&s;es, by the difficulty of breathing, e&s;pe|cially when the patient begins to &s;leep, and by a dry cough; he cannot lie down, but is obliged to fit up in his bed, his body bent forwards, and has commonly his feet &s;wel|led at the beginning of this di&s;temper.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, that the brea&s;t is &s;ome|times di&s;engaged when the &s;wellings of the legs and thighs become very con&s;iderable; and that, on the contrary, the bread be|comes more oppre&s;&s;ed, when this &s;welling &s;uddenly di&s;appears.</P>
<P>This &s;ort of Drop&s;y, e&s;pecially if not in|veterate,
<PB N="64" REF="015100_0063_0F95D34A2CE80478">
is often &s;ucce&s;sfully cured by the u&s;e of the remedy No. 39.</P>
<P>If this does not an&s;wer, nothing remains but the puncture; but we find by expe|rience, that this is but a doubtful means, and not always attended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>As the Diarrhoea &s;ometimes &s;erves for the evacuation of bad humours, it follows, that it is not always hurtful, and that it may even be advantageous.</P>
<P>It is of &s;ervice when it does not affect the &s;trength, but, on the contrary, renders the body more light and alert. On the other hand, it is hurtful when it brings on langour and weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Diarrhoea, that at fir&s;t appeared &s;er|viceable, may become detrimental, by its too long duration, viz. if it la&s;ts four or five days; for then the body is worn out by too long a flux, the inte&s;tines excoriate, a lively pain of the lower belly, with

<HEAD>THE DYSENTERY.</HEAD>
<P>A DIARRHOEA too long neglected often, degenerates into a Dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>BUT it mo&s;t commonly happens, that it is not preceded by that di&s;order; and in the army it reigns during the heat of &s;um|mer, and the beginning of autumn.</P>
<P>A FLUX of the belly, attended with vio|lent gripings, and very painful &s;trainings for &s;tool, is called a Dy&s;entery.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="015100_0068_0F95D34DEC37D6E8">THE &s;tools are not always accompanied with blood, as &s;everal phy&s;icians have pre|tended, who therefore have called this di&s;|order <HI>the bloody flux.</HI></P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, the foecal matters are often reddi&s;h and bloody, e&s;pecially if the di&s;order has la&s;ted any time.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;temper chiefly prevails among the troops. The cau&s;es that produce it are as follow:</P>
<P>THE bile grown acrid by the great heats and the fatigues of war; e&s;pecially if the &s;oldier, when heated, &s;uddenly expo&s;es him&s;elf to cold air, or &s;leeps in his cloaths, &s;oaked with rain: for which rea&s;on it is often brief in places, where cold nights &s;ucceed to hot days.</P>
<P>STAGNATING, or mar&s;h water for common drink.</P>
<P>MEAT, or fi&s;h, beginning to be tainted, mu&s;ty bread, or bread made of mu&s;ty corn for food.</P>
<P>SURE and reiterated ob&s;ervations con|vince us, that &s;ummer fruits &s;carce ever cau&s;e the Dy&s;entery; but the exce&s;s of them may do hurt.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;temper proceeding from the cau&s;es ju&s;t de&s;cribed, &s;oon infects a whole army: the healthy &s;oldiers are more e&s;pe|cially infected by the putrid exhalations of
<PB N="70" REF="015100_0069_0F95D34EAE0D2F40">
the foecal matters, if they u&s;e the &s;ame bog-hou&s;es as the &s;ick.</P>
<P>THIS point mu&s;t therefore be carefully attended to, when the Dy&s;entery prevails among the troops: it would be proper to dig deep trenches to &s;erve for nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;ick &s;oldiers, to cover &s;everal times in a day the foecal matters with earth, and to have other trenches re&s;erved altogether for tho&s;e in health.</P>
<P>TO change the camp often would al&s;o be a proper means to &s;top the progre&s;s of this di&s;order; and by what has been &s;aid re|lative to the cau&s;es, it will appear nece&s;|&s;ary to take all po&s;&s;ible care to avoid them.</P>
<P>THE manner of treating the Dy&s;entery is as follows:</P>

<P>AS the Dy&s;entery is &s;eldom attended with a Fever, and then bleeding is of no u&s;e, it will be &s;ufficient to give the patient the powder No. 46. in wine.</P>

<P>THE &s;ame remedies are to be repeated next day; and if the di&s;order is not entire|ly, or much abated, the third day again.</P>
<P>BUT if the di&s;temper is con&s;iderably di|mi&s;hed, it will be proper to leave a day's interval between the u&s;e of the&s;e remedies, before they are given a third time.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE has &s;hown, that in&s;tead of the powder No. 46. that No. 48. with the pill No. 47. at night, has been given with good &s;ucce&s;s.

After the&s;e evacuations, the patient may, for &s;everal days, take at morning, noon, and night, one drachm of the electuary No. 49.</P>
<P>HIS drink mu&s;t be two parts in three of barley or millet water, and one of new milk; and this is to be u&s;ed in large quantities.</P>

<P>BUT if the malignity or duration of the di&s;temper &s;hould have, in a manner, anni|hilated the &s;trength of the patient, evacuat|ing medicines mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide, as he is already but too weak.</P>
<P>THIS is known to be the ca&s;e, by the violence of the gripings and &s;trainings, by the vacillating &s;mall pul&s;e, by the pale countenance, by the nau&s;eating all food, and by an unextingui&s;hable thir&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>INFLAMMATION of the INTESTINES.</HEAD>
<P>AN INFLAMMATION of the INTES|TINES, a very dangerous di&s;temper, often ari&s;es from the &s;ame cau&s;es as a Dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>IT is di&s;covered by a violent pain of the lower belly, which often increa&s;es upon the touch; by the &s;welling of the belly, by vomitings, and by con&s;tipation. The&s;e &s;ymptoms are attended, at the &s;ame time, with an acute and continual Fever, and a violent heat: the pul&s;e is hard, the urine clear, and of a bright red, and there is a &s;udden pro&s;tration of &s;trength.</P>
<P>IF the &s;ymptoms are violent, mo&s;t com|monly death is &s;oon the con&s;equence. Be|fore the patient expires, the pain cea&s;es; but the extremities become cold and livid, the face cadaverous, the pul&s;e &s;mall, quick,
<PB N="74" REF="015100_0073_0F95D352A143E650">
and unequal. All the&s;e are &s;igns of ap|proaching death; altho' the &s;ick, and tho&s;e about him, are apt to draw an happy omen from the ce&s;&s;ation of pain.</P>
<P>COPIOUS bleeding is immediately to be had recour&s;e to, and repeated boldly if the pains do not go off, or remit con&s;iderably; or if they return again.</P>
<P>LET the patient take the gly&s;ter No. 52. three or four times in a day.</P>
<P>HIS belly mu&s;t be con&s;tantly fomented with flannels &s;teeped in the fomentation No. 12.</P>
<P>THE caul of an animal fre&s;h killed &s;ome|times produces a good effect.</P>
<P>LET the patient take every half hour a warm cup of No. 53.</P>
<P>IT is a good &s;ign if the pul&s;e becomes equal, and remains &s;o, if the pain dimi|ni&s;hes, the &s;ick break wind downward, and the gly&s;ter bring away with it foecal matter.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, notwith&s;tanding &s;everal gly&s;ters, the belly remains ob&s;tinately con|&s;tipated: in this ca&s;e the fumes of tobacco injected thro' the anus have produced very good effects.</P>
<P>THE drink is to be warm barley water, and light broths the whole nouri&s;hment,

until three days after the di&s;order &s;hall have entirely cea&s;ed.</P>

<P>THIS di&s;temper is indeed &s;o violent, that if it does not quickly give way to proper application, it degenerates immediately in|to a mortal gangrene. But, by the careful u&s;e of the above recited remedies, one may hope to re&s;olve the Inflammation of the Inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>IF this method has begun to be u&s;ed too late, if the di&s;temper la&s;ts, without grow|ing wor&s;e, three or four days, and a dead pain &s;ucceeds to the acute pain of the lower belly; if at the &s;ame time the patient feels an unu&s;ual heavine&s;s, and has wander|ing &s;hiverings all over his body, it is certain there is an Ab&s;ce&s;s forming.</P>
<P>IN which ca&s;e he mu&s;t have the fomen|tation No. 12. con&s;tantly applied on his belly during the day, and at night a plai&s;ter of labdanum.</P>
<P>IF the Ab&s;ce&s;s &s;eems to be ready to pierce externally, which may be if the Inte&s;tines adhere to the peritoneum, it mu&s;t be open|ed to di&s;charge the pus. But this ca&s;e &s;el|dom happens.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="015100_0075_0F95D353EB4773D8">IF the Ab&s;ce&s;s breaks in the cavity of the lower belly, the con&s;equence is much to be feared, unle&s;s the matter can be drawn off directly, which is very difficult to be done: nor is it ea&s;y to judge of the exi&s;tence of this ca&s;e, becau&s;e the quantity of matter from out of this Ab&s;ce&s;s is not con&s;iderable enough to cau&s;e any remarka|ble &s;welling of the belly.</P>
<P>THE pus is more frequently evacuated by the anus: the gly&s;ter No. 52. repeated &s;e|veral times, after &s;uppuration is perfected, facilitates its cour&s;e. By the &s;moothing of the internal coat of the inte&s;tines the evacu|ation of the matter becomes ea&s;ier that way.</P>
<P>AFTER the pus is evacuated, whether alone or with the excrements, the patient mu&s;t drink plentifully of the decoction No. 16. &s;weetened with honey, and is to take the powder No. 18. three times a day.</P>

<HEAD>PHRENZY.</HEAD>
<P>A PHRENZY is a continued delirium, at|tended with an acute Fever. It is thereby di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Deli|rium, which is &s;ometimes ob&s;erved in the height of Intermitting Fevers, and which fini&s;hes with the fit.</P>
<P>AN extreme heat, and a violent inflam|matory head-ach, commonly precede the Phrenzy: the eyes and face are red; the patients, when a&s;ked que&s;tions, an&s;wer with ferocity; they pluck the knap of their cover-lids.</P>
<P>THE more frequent cau&s;es of this di&s;tem|per are, the violent heat of the &s;un, to which the &s;oldier is expo&s;ed, e&s;pecially if bare headed, &s;leeping in that condition, long watches, extreme emotions of anger, exce&s;s of wine, brandy, or other &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P>IN this di&s;temper the pul&s;e commonly is quick, and re&s;piration &s;trong, and not fre|quent.</P>
<P>A Phrenzy is very dangerous, and often occa&s;ions &s;udden death, for it is a true in|flammation of the meninges, and &s;ome|times even of the brain it&s;elf.</P>
<P>GREENISH vomitings, frequent &s;pitting, &s;hiverings, crude aqueous and pale urine,

convul&s;ions, and no thir&s;t, are bad &s;igns: bleeding piles, a flux of the belly, a copi|ous haemorrhage of the no&s;e, give relief to the patient.</P>
<P>PAIN of the brea&s;t, or of the lower parts, is good in this illne&s;s: a &s;trong cough coming on, &s;ometimes al&s;o gives ea&s;e.</P>
<P>BLEEDING here is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary: it &s;hould be large, and chiefly in the foot: if the Fever and heat continue, it mu&s;t be re|peated: and it will be right, after the fir&s;t bleeding of the foot, to open one of the jugulars.</P>
<P>THE bleedings mu&s;t be repeated, till the extreme heat and the violence of the Deli|rium are abated. While the patient does not &s;leep, he mu&s;t take every hour a cup of the remedy No. 54. warm.</P>
<P>FOR his common drink, the decoction No. 25. may be u&s;ed, and night and morn|ing the gly&s;ter No. 11. be given.</P>
<P>IF the haemorrhoids &s;well, let leeches be applied.</P>
<P>IT will be proper to &s;have the patient's head, and to make him rin&s;e his mouth often with warm water: let a compre&s;s dip|ped in oxycrate, or vinegar, and water, in equal quantities, be applied on his forehead: fre&s;h and temperate air is mo&s;t proper for him, and he ought to be kept &s;itting up|right

<P>IT would be al&s;o proper to make him ri&s;e twice a day, to &s;et him in an arm chair, and bathe his feet in warm water. After the night bathing, the pa&s;te No. 55. &s;hould be applied to the &s;oles of his feet, and lie on till morning.</P>
<P>DURING the whole time of the illne&s;s, he mu&s;t be confined to plain barley water, or water gruel.</P>
<P>IF, after the u&s;e of the&s;e remedies, the Fever begins &s;en&s;ibly to grow le&s;s, and the Delirium to wear off, but the patient can get no &s;leep, let him have the emul&s;ion No. 17. at night, with the addition of an ounce and a half of &s;yrup of white poppies.</P>
<P>BUT anodynes mu&s;t be carefully avoided, while the illne&s;s continues in its force.</P>
<P>AT the beginning of this dangerous di&s;|temper, all the remedies here recited mu&s;t be vigorou&s;ly employed: but when the heat and Delirium are con&s;iderably dimi|ni&s;hed, bleeding and gly&s;ters are no longer nece&s;&s;ary, the drink No. 25. will be &s;uffi|cient, and the nouri&s;hment may be a little &s;tronger.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the diminution of the &s;ymptoms, it happens often enough, that the Delirium does not entirely give way:

<HEAD>HAEMORRHAGE of the NOSE.</HEAD>
<P>AS Bleeding of the No&s;e is a pretty common &s;ymptom in ardent Fevers, almo&s;t always giving relief, and &s;ometimes even curing the di&s;temper, it is ea&s;ily apprehended, that it mu&s;t not be too lightly &s;topped.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ometimes the Bleeding of the No&s;e is &s;o violent, both in &s;ick per&s;ons, and in tho&s;e who are in health, that bodily &s;trength is &s;o wa&s;ted, as to bring on total faintings, &s;o that even death may en&s;ue.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e, the too violent Haemorrhage mu&s;t be &s;topped. To judge when this ought to be done, requires a little attention to the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>WHILE the pul&s;e keeps full, and the heat of the body is every where equal, even to the extremities, and the lips and the face keep their red colour, there is no fear from the Haemorrhage, was it even violent.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="015100_0080_0F95D357AD9C9320">BUT when the pul&s;e begins to undulate, and the face and lips grow pale, it is time to &s;top the bleeding.</P>
<P>THE means of &s;topping it are, applying bandages to the arms and thighs of the pa|tient, becau&s;e the veins being thereby com|pre&s;&s;ed, the reflux of the blood to the heart is in le&s;s quantity. The Haemorrhage &s;topped, the bandages are not to be loo&s;en|ed all at once, but &s;ucce&s;&s;ively one after another, in &s;uch a manner as to leave the &s;pace of a quarter of an hour between the loo&s;ening of each bandage.</P>
<P>IF, by the application of the bandages in the manner de&s;cribed, the Haemorrhage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not &s;topped, or if it comes on again after taking them off, the following meth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to be u&s;ed:</P>

If &s;ome lint dipped in the &s;tiptic be wrapped round a quill, it will be ea&s;ily introduced up the no&s;e: at fir&s;t, for about half an inch, it mu&s;t be put up ho|rizontally, then rai&s;ing the quill in&s;en&s;ibly, it is to be pu&s;hed gently, and by this means the lint introduced as far as po&s;&s;ible with|out hurting the adjacent parts. Afterwards, by gently compre&s;&s;ing the no&s;trils, the quill may be withdrawn, and the lint le&s;t in the

<HEAD>A CONTINUED FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>A FEVER, that la&s;ts from the moment of the fir&s;t acce&s;s, without interrup|tion, to the end of the di&s;ea&s;e, is called a continued Fever.</P>
<P>THE principal cau&s;es of Fevers of this &s;ort in an Army, are, exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, and extreme la&s;&s;itude, which is its con&s;equence, e&s;pecially during the heat of &s;ummer, if the &s;oldier is under the nece&s;&s;ity of endur|ing thir&s;t, or drink too much &s;piritous li|quors.</P>
<P>FOR the mo&s;t fluid and lighte&s;t parts of the blood being by the&s;e means lo&s;t; what remains, grown more thick and acrid, is in a &s;tate to occa&s;ion great di&s;orders, and above all inflammatory ones, becau&s;e the ma&s;s of humours &s;o thickened is now greatly di&s;|po&s;ed to inflammation.</P>
<P>WHEN a Fever of this &s;ort produces a topical inflammation, the di&s;ea&s;e takes its
<PB N="83" REF="015100_0082_0F95D3592B3E9268">
name from the part affected: for the Pleu|ri&s;y, Peripneumony, Phrenzy, &s;ore Throat, (<HI>Quinzy,</HI>) Inflammation of the inte&s;tines, are often preceded, and always accompa|nied with a continued Fever.</P>
<P>BUT when it happens that &s;ome of the above recited cau&s;es occa&s;ion this Fever, and that it affects no part in particular, it is called &s;imply a Continued Fever.</P>
<P>THIS Fever is known by the cau&s;es that precede it, by the vigour of the time of life, and a hot and &s;anguine con&s;titution, by a hard and quick pul&s;e, and chiefly by its extreme heat, which burns, as it were, the fingers of him who touches it. The urine is red, thick, turbid, the tongue dry, the thir&s;t great; often an intolerable pain of the head, and an ob&s;tructed re&s;piration.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e, always dangerous, is more or le&s;s &s;o according to the violence of the de&s;cribed &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>LARGE bleedings are nece&s;&s;ary in the be|ginning, which are to be repeated till the great heat and dryne&s;s of the tongue begins to abate. Barley water is the common and proper drink; but to every pint &s;hould be added an ounce of the remedy No. 31. of which let him take largely; let there be given him every two hours a cup of the de|coction
<PB N="84" REF="015100_0083_0F95D359EC1AAE10">
No. 54. and twice a day the gly&s;ter No. 11.</P>
<P>THIS method is to be continued till the decline of the di&s;temper, which is known by the diminution of heat, of the quick|ne&s;s of the pul&s;e, and of thir&s;t; by the hu|midity of the mouth and tongue, by the urine being not &s;o high coloured, and by the &s;ediment it then depo&s;es. The &s;ame regimen to be ob&s;erved as in the Pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>AS the di&s;ea&s;e grows milder, the decoc|tion No. 25. will be &s;ufficient for common drink, and let the diet be gradually aug|mented till he is quite well.</P>
<P>IT is highly nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that there is al&s;o another &s;ort of Continued Fever, without an inflammatory thickne&s;s of the blood, but rather occa&s;ioned by a putrid di&s;&s;olution of the humours. This la&s;t &s;ort is much wor&s;e, and more dange|rous than the other, and very often this Fever proves contagious.</P>
<P>THIS happens mo&s;t frequently, when, during the great heats, the Army is en|camped in mar&s;hy places; for then they re&s;pire an air corrupted with bad effluvia. This &s;ort of Fever prevails al&s;o very much, where many men, even were they healthy, are lodged together in a narrow &s;pace, where the air cannot be renewed
<PB N="85" REF="015100_0084_0F95D35AABF0DB08">
often enough. Ships of war and ho&s;pitals, where the &s;ick and wounded are much &s;traitened, are frequently vi&s;ited by the&s;e Fevers, e&s;pecially if the air cannot be re|fre&s;hed often enough; becau&s;e the air then to be re&s;pired is &s;o corrupted by the effluvia from the bodies, the &s;tink of the excre|ments, and the putridne&s;s of the gangrened parts, that it engenders a very bad, and truly putrid Fever, which &s;oon grows con|tagious. It is therefore &s;ometimes called the Jail or Ho&s;pital Fever. Its particular &s;ymptoms &s;hould be exactly de&s;cribed, thereby to know this di&s;temper.</P>
<P>IT begins by a &s;hivering, followed by a heat, but not violent; &s;oon after, the &s;hivering again, after which the heat, and &s;o the &s;hiverings and heat alternately.</P>
<P>TOTAL lo&s;s of appetite, &s;leep di&s;turbed, and without refre&s;hment, a heavy pain of the head, affecting e&s;pecially the anterior part: the pul&s;e is almo&s;t as in a natural &s;tate: the &s;kin is not always very dry: the &s;ick langui&s;h on in this manner &s;ome days, without being able to attend their bu&s;ine&s;s, yet without being obliged to keep their bed. The tongue is &s;eldom dry; it is more commonly &s;oft, moi&s;t, and covered with a &s;ort of cru&s;t of yellowi&s;h green. The patient dozes much, &s;leeps little, and &s;eems quite ab&s;orbed in profound reveries;
<PB N="86" REF="015100_0085_0F95D35B6CE9F878">
in the progre&s;s of the illne&s;s, comes on a trembling of the hands, hardne&s;s of hear|ing, and dimne&s;s of &s;ight; the pul&s;e be|gins to grow feeble, and the patient is de|&s;irous of cordials and wine. Towards night, all the &s;ymptoms grow wor&s;e: la&s;tly, at different times during the cour&s;e of this di&s;temper, there appear purple &s;pots of an irregular figure.</P>
<P>THE following &s;ymptoms are con&s;idered as mortal: A &s;udden pro&s;tration of &s;trength, weakne&s;s of the &s;ight: the po&s;ture of the &s;ick, &s;tretched on his back, and drawing up his knees to him; reiterated efforts to get out of bed, black aphthae, livid pete|chiae, and &s;tripes al&s;o livid, re&s;embling the blow of a whip &s;pread over the body; the flux of the belly, with lead coloured or blacki&s;h &s;tools, weaken the patient more and more.</P>
<P>DEAFNESS is not a bad &s;ymptom in this di&s;temper. Nay, it has been ob&s;erved, that patients on their recovery are apt to grow deaf, and that &s;ometimes they have an Ab&s;ce&s;s in the conduit of the ear.</P>
<P>BILIOUS &s;tools, thick urine, a moi&s;t tongue, are good omens, e&s;pecially if the patient keep up his &s;trength.</P>
<P>A NUMBER of little red pu&s;tules, or white and elevated miliary ones, are good,

if at the &s;ame time expectoration is ea&s;y, and the urine depo&s;es a thick &s;ediment. La&s;tly, it is counted a good &s;ign, when an ea&s;y &s;weat comes on, and relieves the patient, or the parotids &s;well, or there appear white ap|thae.</P>
<P>AS the cau&s;es here recited indicate that all things tend to putrefaction, and that the &s;trength is extremely exhau&s;ted, bleed|ing can &s;eldom be of u&s;e, unle&s;s in replete habits, and that but once: for large bleed|ings abate the &s;trength immediately, and occa&s;ion a Delirium. It is very nece&s;&s;ary that the air be often renewed.</P>

<HEAD>THE SCURVY</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a common di&s;temper, and of difficult cure, more e&s;pecially in &s;ieges and unhealthy places, where &s;ome|times the troops are obliged to take up their winter-quarters.</P>
<P>IT begins by a numbne&s;s of the limbs, with an unu&s;ual la&s;&s;itude of the whole body: after walking, the limbs and mu&s;cles feel quite fatigued, and, as it were, broken. In the increa&s;e of the di&s;temper, re&s;piration be|comes &s;hort and difficult; &s;ometimes the thighs &s;well; at fir&s;t the face is pale, then grows brown, and the &s;kin is &s;tained with &s;pots of different colours, the mouth begins to &s;mell, the teeth loo&s;en in the &s;ockets, the gums &s;well, itch, grow painful, and bleed on the lea&s;t touch; la&s;tly, wandering pains affect different parts of the body.</P>
<P>IN the progre&s;s of the di&s;temper, the gums putrify and exhale an horrid &s;tench; the teeth grow yellow, then black and calious. Sometimes happen violent haemorrhages; very bad conditioned ulcers break out, e&s;pe|cially on the thighs; the patient feels vio|lent and painful &s;hootings in all his limbs, which increa&s;e in the night, and the body is covered with black &s;pots. At this period
<PB N="90" REF="015100_0089_0F95D35E6972D700">
the di&s;temper &s;uddenly grows wor&s;e, Fevers come on of different kinds, every thing grows quickly putrid, and mortal haemor|rhages break out of the mouth, the no&s;e, or about the anus; the vi&s;cera putrify; and faintings &s;ucceed, which are &s;oon followed by death.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;temper is frequent in winter quarters, from the following cau&s;es.</P>
<P>NOISOME vapours, ari&s;ing from mar&s;hy, grounds and &s;tagnating waters, inaction, &s;carcity of greens and vegetables, drinking of corrupted and &s;tagnating waters, the u&s;e of &s;alted and &s;moaked fle&s;h and fi&s;h, and of chee&s;e too old and acrid; damp and low lodgings, and not being open to the cour&s;e of the winds.</P>
<P>FEAR and &s;orrow al&s;o occa&s;ion this di&s;|order, and increa&s;e it in tho&s;e already at|tacked with it. By that, and by bad food, it often makes &s;uch ravages in be&s;ieged places.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE &s;hows, that the humours in this di&s;ea&s;e are not only putrid and acrimonius, but al&s;o conden&s;ed.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, in the cure, care mu&s;t be taken to attenuate the vi&s;co&s;ity of the hu|mours, and to prevent or correct putre|faction.</P>
<P>WE, are to lend all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art
<PB N="91" REF="015100_0090_0F95D360234F8148">
to prevent, or avoid the cau&s;es of this evil, and thereby pre&s;erve the &s;oldier from the ravages of this di&s;temper.</P>
<P>FIRST, by correcting the impure waters. This is done by mixing two ounces of vi|negar, and two ounces of brandy, to every pot of water. For want of the&s;e, &s;ome &s;lices of calamus aromaticus may be &s;teeped in the water. This is a &s;ort of reed, very common, growing almo&s;t every where, in &s;uch low, mar&s;hy, and damp grounds, as are mo&s;t &s;ubject to the Scurvy.</P>
<P>STRONG purges, vomits, and bleeding, do no &s;ervice in this di&s;temper.</P>
<P>BUT as bad nouri&s;hment is one cau&s;e that produces the &s;curvy, the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines mu&s;t be cleared, and evacuated, which is ea&s;ily done, by gentle and reite|rated purges, &s;uch as No. 34. to be taken three times, with the interval of a day be|tween each.</P>
<P>THE food &s;hould be broth, with chervil, &s;orrel, &s;pinage, lettice, endive, &s;uccory, cabbage, e&s;pecially red cabbage, young nettle buds and tops, or any other &s;ort of tender herbage, boiled in it; the preference to be given to tho&s;e ea&s;ie&s;t to come at.</P>
<P>FRUIT quite ripe, u&s;ed moderately, al|ways produces a good effect: but if neither fruit nor greens can be procured, the pa|tient
<PB N="92" REF="015100_0091_0F95D360AA7D6D18">
mu&s;t have his broth with barley, oats, or rice; he may eat likewi&s;e a little veal, or fowl, but it mu&s;t be moderately.</P>
<P>AFTER the u&s;e of light purgatives, anti|&s;corbutics will be proper, but which are to be varied according to the different con&s;ti|tution of the patient.</P>
<P>IF he feels him&s;elf cold, his face pale, his legs &s;well, and his thir&s;t is not great, let him take two ounces, that is, about a tea-cup of the decoction No. 62. thrice a day.</P>
<P>IF he is hot, his pul&s;e feveri&s;h, his thir&s;t great, his breath bad, his gums bleeding and half putrid, the decoction No. 62 is not &s;o proper as No. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. to the quantity of three ounces thrice a day.</P>
<P>RIPE fruits, and roa&s;ted apples and pears, ea&s;y to be procured, are al&s;o very proper.</P>
<P>THE remedies are to be continued a great while. When the limbs move ea&s;ier, and the pain dimini&s;hes, the di&s;temper grows better, and then exerci&s;e and good food will be &s;ufficient to compleat the cure. To carry of all relicks, it will be proper, on recovery, to take fifty drops of the elixir No. 64. in wine and water, equal quan|tities thrice a-day.</P>
<P>ALTHO' it be certain, that when the di&s;temper is at an end, the &s;ymptoms
<PB N="93" REF="015100_0092_0F95D3616C92C828">
ought likewi&s;e to cea&s;e; yet it is no le&s;s true, that after the &s;curvy, we often &s;ee tho&s;e who have been attacked by it &s;ubject to ulcers of the gums, lips, in&s;ide of the cheeks, and of the palate, which &s;oon &s;pread, and corrode the&s;e parts, and in a little time turn to a gangrene. The&s;e ul|cers often deceive tho&s;e who do not rightly under&s;tand them: they appear in form of white or yellowi&s;h &s;pots, red, and inflamed round the border, and often very painful. A great &s;tench accompanies them, and the &s;pittle, which comes in plenty, is al&s;o of a bad &s;mell. This evil requires an imme|diate remedy, otherwi&s;e all would &s;oon be infected with a gangrenous putrid hu|mour, the teeth would fall out of the &s;ockets, the jaws would be affected, and entirely corrupted.</P>
<P>BUT this di&s;order is ea&s;ily got the better of, by touching the parts lightly and often in the day with a little lint dipped in the pre|paration No. 65. Little compre&s;&s;es, imbued with the &s;ame, may al&s;o be applied between the gums and lip, and renewed from time to time.</P>
<P>CARE mu&s;t be taken not to rub the parts affected too much, as is the bad cu&s;tom of &s;ome, for the evil and pain is thereby aug|mented.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="015100_0093_0F95D3622AA7B938">IF the &s;tench is great, and the ulcers ex|tend them&s;elves rapidly, the quantity of &s;pirit of &s;ea &s;alt is to be augmented, till you get the better of the gangrenous cor|ruption.</P>

<HEAD>THE GANGRENE.</HEAD>
<P>AS mention has been made of the gan|grane, it may be here proper to take notice, that the bark taken internally is a mo&s;t efficacious remedy for this di&s;|temper, what&s;oever part is attacked.</P>
<P>THE patient is to take every four hours one of the powders No. 30. till the gan|grene begins to &s;eperate from the &s;ound parts, and a good &s;uppuration comes on: at which time it will be &s;ufficient for him to take them twice a-day till the ulcer is mundified.</P>
<P>THE bark is equally proper, when the &s;corbutic ulcers of the in&s;ide of the mouth threaten to gangrene.</P>

<HEAD>LUES VENEREA.</HEAD>
<P>VENEREAL di&s;orders are always cau&s;ed by contact, communicated by the infected to, even, the &s;ounde&s;t bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="015100_0094_0F95D362ED56B080">THIS contagion produces many different di&s;orders, which, according to the different parts of the body where it fixes, go under different denominations.</P>
<P>SMALL ulcers appearing at the extremi|ty of the penis, or on the prepuce, are called venereal &s;hancres: if the nervous papillae of the genital parts form little eleva|tions like warts, they are called venereal verrucae: if the internal &s;uperficies of the urethra is affected, there ari&s;es a difficulty and pain in making water, named a &s;trangury, and a running of a yellowi&s;h, greeni&s;h, or &s;ometimes browni&s;h matter; it is then called a gonorrhoea; if &s;wellings in the groins, buboes.</P>
<P>WHEN the virus having gained the blood circulates with the humours, where-ever it &s;tops, it produces evils of different kinds, for in&s;tance, pu&s;tules, and &s;pots upon the &s;kin, that &s;ometimes degenerate into filthy cru&s;ts: ulcers in the adipo&s;e membrane, not giving way in the lea&s;t to &s;uch medi|cines as are proper in other ulcers; which corroding the adjacent parts, leave pro|found and frightful cicatrices: the&s;e ulcers no &s;ooner di&s;appear from one place, but they quickly &s;how them&s;elves again in &s;ome neighbouring part.</P>
<P>THE throat mo&s;t frequently, and the
<PB N="96" REF="015100_0095_0F95D363A9BCAD58">
roof of the mouth, are corroded little by little by this di&s;temper: there appears in the&s;e parts a &s;pot, re&s;embling bacon; the voice becomes hoar&s;e, the action of &s;wallowing is attended with pain, and the &s;pot we &s;poke of gaining ground by little and little, de&s;troys all the &s;oft parts, and at length attacks the bones of the palate and mouth; which grow rotten and fall in, and leave for the re&s;t of life a deformity, for which there can be no remedy.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;temper, e&s;pecially if it is inve|terate, attacks al&s;o the bones, and cau&s;es &s;wellings on them, which if lo&s;t, are called tophi or gummi; if hard, nodes or vene|real exo&s;to&s;es; whence en&s;ue very bad ca|ries, with intolerable pain, wor&s;e in the night, the warmth of the bed increa&s;ing it; but rather ea&s;ier in the day.</P>
<P>WHEN the bones are corroded even to the marrow, the cure is extremely difficult, and tho' cured in appearance, it often re|turns.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;temper may be ea&s;ily known by the de&s;cribed &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>THE following is a &s;afe method of treat|ing it.</P>
<P>LET the patient take, night and morn|ing, one &s;poonful of the medicine No. 66. drinking after it a pint of barley water with
<PB N="97" REF="015100_0096_0F95D3646B48F690">
a third of milk in it, u&s;ing the &s;ame for his common drink: if milk is difficult to get, the decoction No. 67. may be &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in its room.</P>
<P>THIS medicine gives no manner of trouble to the patients; to &s;ome it procures &s;ome light &s;tools, but this &s;eldom; in others it works by urine and &s;weat. Its u&s;e may be continued with the greate&s;t &s;afety till all the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e have ab&s;olutely di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>IF the weather is mild and temperate, the patient may go out; but in cold and damp weather, it is better he &s;hould keep his room.</P>
<P>IF the medicine &s;eems to act too &s;low in robu&s;t habits, or when the di&s;temper is in|veterate, the do&s;e may be augmented to a &s;poonful and a half: and if in &s;ome days the &s;ymptoms do not dimini&s;h, two &s;poonfuls may be given every night and morning, in all four &s;poonfuls a-day.</P>
<P>THE time the patient is to continue the u&s;e of this medicine, cannot be exactly li|mited: often, if the di&s;temper is not very bad, the cure is performed in three weeks; if inveterate, it takes up more time. But it may certainly be u&s;ed along while without the lea&s;t inconvenience.</P>
<P>WHEN the ulcers clean&s;e, and cicatrize,
<PB N="98" REF="015100_0097_0F95D3652C0881B8">
when the rotten parts of the bone &s;eparate and fall off, and when the tumours and nocturnal pains dimini&s;h, the di&s;temper gives way to the remedy.</P>
<P>AS to the regimen of the diet, let the patient have broths with barley, rice, or oats, or tender greens, his fle&s;h meat lean, milk diet, and ripe fruit.</P>
<P>FAT and &s;moaked or &s;alted meat, e&s;pe|cially bacon, are bad.</P>
<P>THE following remark is nece&s;&s;ary to be attended to. Sometimes a &s;alivation comes on from the u&s;e of this medicine, but this is but &s;eldom, and almo&s;t only to tho&s;e who have before made u&s;e of mercury, either internally or externally: neverthele&s;s, &s;ali|vation not being nece&s;&s;ary to the cure, the u&s;e of the medicine No. 66. is to be left off immediately on the fir&s;t &s;igns of a &s;pitting coming on.</P>
<P>BUT the decoction No. 67. may be &s;till continued.</P>
<P>THE &s;igns of an approaching &s;alivation are as follow.</P>
<P>THE gums begin to &s;well, to grow red, to itch, and become painful, and the breath to &s;mell ill. As &s;oon as the&s;e &s;ymptoms are remarked, the u&s;e of the remedy No. 66. mu&s;t, as has been before &s;aid, be &s;u&s;|pended: but if in eight or ten days the&s;e

&s;ymptoms di&s;appear, and the patient is not cured, it may again be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>IF he has a gonorrhoea, he mu&s;t drink plentifully of the decoction No. 67. to take off the acrimony of the urine; he may bathe the penis thrice a-day, for a quarter of an hour at a time, in equal quantities of water and milk warm.</P>
<P>IF, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the gonnorrhoea, or from any other cau&s;e, a te&s;ticle becomes &s;welled and painful, and the &s;crotum red; let him be bled immediately, the fomenta|tion No. 12. applied to the te&s;ticle, and let him drink plentifully of the decoction No. 1. adding twenty grains of nitre to each pint. After the redne&s;s, &s;welling, and Fever, which often attend &s;welled te&s;ticles, are appea&s;ed, it will be proper to make u&s;e of the remedy No. 66.</P>
<P>IF venereal buboes grow hard, a plai&s;ter of galbanum is to be applied.</P>

<P>IS a very trouble&s;ome di&s;temper to armies, and immediately &s;preads by contact, un|le&s;s the affected &s;oldiers are &s;eparated from tho&s;e who are well.</P>
<P>THOUGH all the external parts of the

It is not ea&s;y in the beginning to di&s;tingui&s;h the Itch, unle&s;s one is well acquainted with this di&s;order: but in its progre&s;s the pu&s;tules augment both in number and &s;ize; and when opened by &s;cratching, a di&s;gu&s;t|ful cru&s;t is formed, and the evil gains the &s;uperficies of the whole body.</P>
<P>HITHERTO the Itch hath its &s;eat be|tween the epidermis and the &s;kin; but if it continues long, it makes way through the &s;kin into the membrana adipo&s;a, where it forms &s;mall ulcers, commonly in great number. This &s;ort of Itch is the na&s;tie&s;t and wor&s;t, and at the &s;ame time extremely contagious.</P>
<P>IT is to be treated in the following manner.</P>
<P>THE body is to be kept clean, and linen often changed: if the &s;ea&s;on of the year per|mit, they mu&s;t bathe, and in waters im|pregnated with &s;ulphur, if they can: if they cannot, experience &s;hews, that to bathe
<PB N="101" REF="015100_0100_0F95D2E5AE0D1BB8">

<P>LET the patient take the purging powder No. 68. in the morning fa&s;ting, and repeat it every eight days.</P>
<P>ON the intermediate days, let him take, morning, noon, and night, one of the pow|ders No. 69.</P>
<P>LET the parts affected be anointed every night with the ointment No. 70.</P>
<P>IF the Itch covers both the whole body and all the limbs, they mu&s;t not all be a|nointed together at once; but you may be|gin by the hands, and the arms; continue the next day by the feet, legs, and thighs, and the third day the body; the fourth day to begin again by the hands and arms, the fifth the feet, &amp;c. and &s;o on to the entire cure.</P>
<P>WHEN the pu&s;tules are dry, the cru&s;ts fall, and the ulcers di&s;appear and return no more, the patient is well.</P>
<P>SOME &s;pots will, indeed, remain on the &s;kin, but the&s;e marks wear off in&s;en&s;ibly, and in time quite di&s;appear.</P>

<HEAD>OF WOUNDS OF THE VEINS, ARTERIES, NERVES, AND TENDONS, WITH OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IN Wounds of the Veins, the blood flows with a &s;mooth even &s;tream, of a gro&s;s con&s;i&s;tence and dark color; and is ordi|narily re&s;trained by the common methods, &s;uch as dry lint, &s;typtics, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If an Artery is wounded, the blood flows impetuou&s;ly and per &s;altum, and is of a florid color; to &s;uppre&s;s which, if the ori|fice be acce&s;&s;ible, make a ligature on the Artery with a crooked needle and waxed thread, which is the &s;ure&s;t and be&s;t me|thod: but the haemorrhage may be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by the torniquet, till the ligature can be made. If it be not acce&s;&s;ible, and the Artery runs along the &s;ide of a bone, apply a &s;uitable bandage, compre&s;&s;es, or bol&s;ters. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to compre&s;s it &s;o much as totally to preclude the acce&s;&s;ion of any blood, but only to impede its efflux, and retain the thrombus, &s;o as to grow to the &s;ides of the divided arterial coats. It requires great judgment, however, not to let the compre&s;&s;ion be too &s;mall, to prevent an Aneuri&s;m. But if the wounded artery lies within a bone which prevents its late|ral compre&s;&s;ion, the only means remaining is to apply dry lint, and retain it forcibly again&s;t the divided orifice. Neither &s;typtics nor cauteries &s;hould ever be u&s;ed to &s;up|pre&s;s an haemorrhage when ligature or com|pre&s;&s;ion can take place.</P>
<P>If a large Nerve be totally divided, at
<PB REF="015100_0114_0F95D2F0EE488A90">
fir&s;t it cau&s;es excruciating pain and inflam|mation by contracting and &s;tretching the other branches communicating with it; afterwards the part becomes paralytic, and either fades by an atrophy, or is con&s;umed by a mortification. For the arteries being no longer able to propel their contained fluids, for want of the Nerves which &s;up|ply their coats, the humors are accumulat|ed, &s;tagnate, corrupt, and mortify the part. But if the Nerve (or even a Tendon) be only half divided, there follows a continual and &s;low laceration, a &s;preading inflammation, excruciating pain, fever, delirium, convul|&s;ions, &amp;c. with a gleet, or thick &s;erous di&s;charge; which &s;ymptoms are in propor|tion more violent as the Nerve is more di|&s;tended or &s;tretched.</P>
<P>In order to the cure, if the Nerve lie cove|red, under the &s;kin and membrana adipo&s;a, dilate the Wound, that the medicaments may penetrate to the part. Dre&s;s with bal&s;. peruv. warm (dropped in) a pledget of &s;oft dige&s;tive, and an emollient poultice, with a proper bandage to take off the di&s;ten|tion. Wounds of the Tendons and Liga|ments are to be dre&s;&s;ed after the &s;ame man|ner, only the applications &s;hould be more drying.</P>
<P>In the u&s;e of the&s;e, if the patient feel the heat of the topics moderate, then they are rightly fitted: if the part itch and &s;mart, and the aperture become wider, the topics are &s;tronger than they ought to be.</P>

<HEAD>OF GUN-SHOT WOUNDS, THEIR NATURE AND TREATMENT, WITH OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>"GUN-SHOT Wounds, of all others, are more complicate, and much more difficult of cure than an inci&s;ed Wound, even with lots of &s;ub&s;tance: becau&s;e here the fibres and ve&s;&s;els being lacerated, their juices extrava&s;ated, and their texture de&s;troyed, a large dige&s;tion or &s;uppuration is nece&s;&s;ary to remove the injured parts, before the Wound can be incarned and healed; and hence al&s;o the &s;ymptoms of inflammation, pain, &amp;c. are commonly more violent in Contu&s;ed Wounds."</P>
<P>"They are more or le&s;s dangerous, ac|cording to their extent, and the part in which they are &s;eated. Tho&s;e which extend into the bones, vi&s;cera, or joints, are of the wor&s;e kind; and e&s;pecially when any of the wadding, cloths, or &s;plinters are car|ried into the part together with the ball; for the con&s;equences, in the&s;e ca&s;es, mu&s;t be inflammations, gangrenes, caries, &amp;c. which make an amputation nece&s;&s;ary. But Gun-&s;hot Wounds in the cranium are above all the mo&s;t malignant and fatal; though even here we have often &s;urpri&s;ing
<PB N="118" REF="015100_0116_0F95D2F26ABBD5A8">
in&s;tances of cures made by art and the ef|forts of nature, when the ca&s;e has appeared to be de&s;perate."</P>
<P>"The following method is extracted from Mr. Ranby's excellent Treati&s;e on Gun-&s;hot Wounds, who&s;e penetrating judgment, and great experience in &s;uch ca&s;es, mu&s;t be univer&s;ally acknowledged."</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t intention, in regard of acci|dents cau&s;ed by a mu&s;ket or pi&s;tol ball, is, if po&s;&s;ible, to extract the ball, or any other extraneous body that may be lodged in the wounded part. And whenever the&s;e ca&s;ualties are attended with a great effu|&s;ion of blood, from the rupture of &s;ome con&s;iderable arterial ve&s;&s;el, it will be ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, with all imaginable di&s;|patch, to re&s;train the bleeding by taking up the artery with the needle; and, at the &s;ame time, to be particularly careful that your held proves no way elu&s;ive. There is no depending on any applications, however &s;typtic, on the&s;e occa&s;ions."</P>
<P>"In order to get at the ball, or any other foreign matter that infe&s;ts the wound, I would advi&s;e probing or poking to be u&s;ed as &s;paringly as po&s;&s;ible; having con&s;tantly experienced, through the whole cour&s;e of my attendance in the&s;e ca&s;es, that &s;uch a method is highly detrimental to the patient:
<PB N="119" REF="015100_0117_0F95D2F32C9DAD38">
and, indeed, where probing is nece&s;&s;ary, I would always prefer the finger as the be&s;t and true&s;t probe."</P>
<P>"If a ball, or any other body happens to be lodged near the orifice, or is found by the touch to lie under the &s;kin, though at &s;ome di&s;tance from the mouth of the Wound; in the fir&s;t ca&s;e it is requi&s;ite immediately to remove &s;uch extraneous matter; and, on the other occa&s;ion, to cut upon it, and take it out. But when it is &s;unk deep, and lies ab&s;olutely beyond the reach of the finger, I could never bring my&s;elf to thru&s;t tho&s;e long forceps the Lord knows where, with &s;carce any pro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s."</P>
<P>"A great number of in&s;tances have oc|curred to me, where balls have been quietly lodged in the body; till, after many years, they have worked them&s;elves a pa&s;&s;age to|wards the &s;urface, and were con&s;equently very ea&s;ily extracted. In ca&s;e the wound be occa&s;ioned by a mu&s;ket or pi&s;tol &s;hot, and con&s;equently but &s;mall, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to dilate it immediately: yet, I think, in Wounds near a joint, or in very membra|nous or tendinous parts, the knife, as well as forceps, &s;hould be put under &s;ome re&s;traint; nor any more opening made,
<PB N="120" REF="015100_0118_0F95D2F3EDEC8010">
than what is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for the free di&s;charge of the matter lodged within."</P>
<P>"Wounds in the joints are always dan|gerous, let them proceed from whatever cau&s;e, whether a bullet, or any cutting in&s;trument; and membranous or tendinous parts mu&s;t undoubtedly &s;uffer from their being thus expo&s;ed to the very &s;en&s;ible im|pre&s;&s;ions of the air. I could produce many in&s;tances of balls going through mu&s;cular parts, and the Wounds being healed with very little trouble. And I have known Wounds of the &s;kull from a broad-&s;word (both tables having been cut through, and a con&s;iderable piece loo&s;ened) which were &s;uffered to bleed for &s;everal hours, and did well; nor were attended, at lea&s;t very &s;eldom, with any feveri&s;h complaint; which was probably owing to the great quantity of blood lo&s;t immediately after the parts had been injured. If the ball has gone quite through, both orifices are to be wid|ened (if in a part where it can be done with &s;afety) and particular care is to be taken to pre&s;erve both openings, that e&s;pecially which is the mo&s;t depending. No tents are to be made u&s;e of, where there is any po&s;&s;ibility of avoiding them; and I would, in general, recommend light, ea&s;y dre&s;|&s;ings, with a &s;light, moderate bandage, ju&s;t
<PB N="121" REF="015100_0119_0F95D2F4ABF80EC8">
&s;ufficient to keep them on the part. Thin flannel is what I would prefer, in ca&s;e it can be got."</P>
<P>"Where the wounded per&s;on has not &s;uffered any great lo&s;s of blood, it will be advi&s;eable to open a vein immediately, and take from the arm a very large quantity, and to repeat bleeding, as circum&s;tances may require, the &s;econd, and even the third day. This timely precaution will pre|vent a god deal of pain and inflammation, forward the dige&s;tion, and contribute to|wards obviating a long train of compli|cated &s;ymptoms, that are wont otherwi&s;e to interrupt the cure, mi&s;erably harra&s;s the poor patient, and too often endanger his life."</P>
<P>"For the fir&s;t twelve days it will be proper to ob&s;erve a cooling regimen, both in re&s;pect of medicines and diet: and as, in circum&s;tances of this kind, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the body &s;hould by all means be open, a &s;tool &s;hould be every day procured, either by emollient cly&s;ters, or &s;ome gentle lax|ative. Whatever application is of a hot, &s;piritous nature, I find remarkably injurious on the&s;e occa&s;ions, and what no wounded part can in any degree bear."</P>
<P>"Let the fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ing be with lint, dry, or moi&s;tened with a little oil, and a
<PB N="122" REF="015100_0120_0F95D2F56ED1E2B8">
very light bandage; the next with a di|ge&s;tive warmed, and over it the bread and milk poultice, mixed with a &s;ufficient quantity of oil to keep it moi&s;t: and, where there is a great ten&s;ion, and the Wound large, a fomentation. This cour&s;e is to be continued till the &s;ore is clean; and then it is to be healed according to art."</P>
<P>"This method will commonly promote a con&s;tant, ea&s;y per&s;piration, abate the pain, very much facilitate the dige&s;tion, and remove all danger of any approaching inflammation. What induces me to moi|&s;ten the lint with oil, is the ea&s;e that is procured to a Contu&s;ed Wound from &s;uch an application, in compari&s;on with one of an ab&s;orbent, drying di&s;po&s;ition; which, in&s;teed of giving free liberty to the &s;anious blood to di&s;charge it&s;elf, and con&s;equently preventing an inflammation by unloading the part, would po&s;&s;ibly ob&s;truct the mouths of the capillary ve&s;&s;els, and hinder nature from getting rid of that incumbrance, which &s;he endeavors to throw off."</P>
<P>"Should an inflammation &s;eize any part, through the lodgment of a bullet, or any other foreign body, that could with &s;afety have been more immediately extract|ed; all attempts for di&s;lodging &s;uch ex|traneous
<PB N="123" REF="015100_0121_0F95D2F62AA73850">
matter &s;hould be po&s;tponed, till the &s;welling has in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ub&s;ided, and the inflammatory di&s;po&s;ition of the fibres is nearly vani&s;hed: unle&s;s the ball, or other extraneous body, lies at no great di&s;tance from the orifice; and there is, on that account, a certainty of removing this incumbrance, without any material trouble to the patient."</P>
<P>"If a Wound be of &s;uch a de&s;perate nature, as to require amputation (which is often the ca&s;e, when it happens in any particular joint) it would certainly be of con&s;equence to perform the operation im|mediately as &s;oon as the patient is brought down; le&s;t by delaying it an inflammation, which one may very rea&s;onably expect, &s;hould ob&s;truct a work that ought rarely to be entered upon during the continuance of &s;o calamitous a circum&s;tance as that of a &s;mart engagement. The neglecting this critical juncture of taking off a limb fre|quently reduces the patient to &s;o low a &s;tate, and &s;ubjects the blood and juices to &s;uch an alteration, as mu&s;t unavoidably ren|der the &s;ub&s;equent operation, if not entirely un&s;ucce&s;sful, at lea&s;t exceedingly dubious. And in Wounds even where no amputation is required, it is equally advi&s;eable not to defer me care nece&s;&s;ary to be taken of them;

<P>"Wounds that border on any con&s;ider|able artery are very apt to bleed afre&s;h upon motion, or a return of a free circulation of the blood into the part which was inter|rupted at fir&s;t by the violence of the injury offered it; and this is almo&s;t always the the ca&s;e, when the &s;lough begins to &s;epa|rate: for which rea&s;on one &s;hould never attempt to remove it by force; but wait, with patience, till there be a perfect &s;epa|ration of this &s;lough; nor be in the lea&s;t|wi&s;e &s;hocked at the accident of arteries thus opening them&s;elves, which a very moderate experience will convince one to be almo&s;t inevitable. The patient frequently gives warning of what is coming upon him, by complaining of a great weight and ful|ne&s;s in the limbs, which are ever accom|panied with more or le&s;s pul&s;ation in them: an infallible progno&s;tic of the con&s;equences. Let the Wound afflict what&s;oever part, if the&s;e complaints attend it, I in&s;tantly en|join bleeding and the bark."</P>
<P>"I have known &s;everal in&s;tances of per&s;ons lo&s;ing their lives from the &s;tarting of an artery before the &s;urgeon could reach them; particularly where there has

preceded an amputation. And I dare affirm, the quantity of blood lo&s;t in &s;ome ca&s;es, which I have ob&s;erved to kill, has not a|mounted to twelve ounces; which I do not know how to account for otherwi&s;e, than by the drain which had been made from the ma&s;s of blood both before and during the operation; whence a &s;udden gu&s;h, though of &s;o moderate a portion of blood, after the great quantity already lo&s;t, gives a check to the circulation, and cau&s;es immediate death."</P>
<P>"This reflection, I think, ought to be a le&s;&s;on to every practitioner, to be parti|cularly intent on the faithful di&s;charge of his duty in regard of tying the ve&s;&s;els. Repeated bleedings in the beginning draw after them many advantages: they gene|rally prevent, and always le&s;&s;en, any feve|ri&s;h attacks, and &s;eldom fail to obviate impo&s;thumations."</P>

<P>"In this unhappy &s;tate, the bark, given in do&s;es of a drachm each, and repeated every three hours (or oftener, if the &s;to|mach will bear it) &s;urpri&s;ingly repairs the breach made in the con&s;titution by the&s;e terrible accidents. Elixir of vitriol taken three times a-day, in a gla&s;s of water, I find to be of &s;ingular benefit, and to prove a very good a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the virtues of the bark. And if the body be co&s;tive, to each do&s;e of the bark I add four or five grains of rhubarb, till that inconvenience is remedied. Should the bark run off by more than four or five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tools, I take care to check this effect of it by ordering two or three drops of laudanum, or two &s;poonfuls of the dia&s;cordium mixture along with it, every time it is given".</P>

<HEAD>SOME BRIEF DIRECTIONS PREVIOUS TO, AND IN ENGAGEMENTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE value of an able &s;urgeon, and the nece&s;&s;ity of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, never more plainly appears than in dangerous wounds received in an engagement or battle; where many brave men mu&s;t unavoidably peri&s;h from lo&s;s of blood and other cau&s;es, unle&s;s re&s;tored and &s;natched, as it were, from the jaws of death by the &s;kill of their &s;urgeon. And no doubt, the better opi|nion the officers and men conceive of their &s;urgeon, the more &s;pirits they have for the action; being confident, the wounds, &amp;c. they may chance to receive will be properly treated, and their lives (if po&s;&s;ible) pre|&s;erved. Therefore a &s;urgeon of a man of war &s;hould have every thing needful, in a &s;ufficient quantity, always by him in readi|ne&s;s (but more particularly in time of war) placed in &s;ome kind of box or drawer by them&s;elves. His capital in&s;truments &s;hould be con&s;tantly kept clean, bright, and in good order. His apparatus &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal tourniquets (of which Petit's &s;crew tourniquet is the mo&s;t convenient, as the patient can ea&s;ily manage it him&s;elf, after it is fixed) crooked needles of all &s;izes, threaded with proper flat ligatures, in pro|portion to the needle; a large quantity of
<PB N="130" REF="015100_0128_0F95D2FC2B047F38">
&s;craped (&s;hort) lint, &s;ome mixed with flour in a bowl; double and &s;ingle headed rol|lers (or bandages) of all breadths and lengths, in good &s;tore; for &s;light wounds and con|tu&s;ions, tho&s;e made of bunting (the fly-part of an old en&s;ign) will be &s;ufficient; but for ca&s;es of more con&s;equence, &s;uch as am|putations, fractures, di&s;locations, &amp;c. the linen rollers mu&s;t be u&s;ed. He ought to be furni&s;hed with common needles and thread, with pins in plenty; pledgets of tow, of what &s;izes he plea&s;es; after they are made, they may be wet with water, or oxycrate, on the &s;ame board, and dried either by the galley-fire or in the &s;un. By this means he may the better lay them to|gether (in a drawer or box) without in|tangling, and they are both much better and readier to &s;pread, when wanted, with any cerate, ointment, or liniment.</P>
<P>Splints of all &s;izes mu&s;t al&s;o be at hand, and when u&s;ed armed with tow, or old linen cloth; likewi&s;e bol&s;ters, or compre&s;&s;es of cloth, or coar&s;e tow; but the&s;e may be readily made as occa&s;ion requires. To the above add yards of incle, or &s;trong tape, to &s;ecure your &s;plints in fractures, and for other u&s;es. By this method a &s;ur|geon will always be provided again&s;t every accident which may befall his Crew.</P>

<P>A number of large candies &s;hould be im|mediately lighted, as &s;oon as the engage|ment begins, not forgetting to have your mates and a&s;&s;i&s;tants properly in&s;tructed in what part they are to act, that every one may know his &s;tation, and what he has to

to prevent confu&s;ion in time of action.

<P>All things being ordered, and placed as above in readine&s;s, and the &s;urgeon's and pur&s;er's cabbin beds made up, to receive the captain, or any of his commi&s;&s;ion of|ficers, who may chance to be wounded; if you have any &s;ick on board, that can|not &s;tand to their quarters, let them be put down with their hammock and bedding into the hold, fore cockpit, or &s;heet cable tier, out of the way before the action begins; but be &s;ure to keep your platform entirely for the wounded men. Let one of your mates or a&s;&s;i&s;tants go to them now-and-then to &s;ee how they are; or el&s;e order one of the &s;toute&s;t of the convale&s;cents to come to you at times, if he is able, and acquaint you if any of them are wor&s;e, and in ca&s;e of faintne&s;s, to give them a little cordial, which he &s;hould have by him for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When the action is begun, if more than one wounded is brought down at a time,
<PB N="134" REF="015100_0132_0F95D2FF2ED3E658">
always fir&s;t take care of him who is in the mo&s;t immediate danger; but otherwi&s;e dre&s;s them as they come, without di&s;tinc|tion: if any is brought down with a limb off, or a violent haemorrhage, and you hap|pen to be in the mid&s;t of an amputation, or other capital operation, and cannot that in&s;tant attend, order your mate or a&s;&s;i&s;tant (for the pre&s;ent) immediately to &s;ix a tour|niquet on the part, to re&s;train the flux of blood from being fatal to the patient, and do what el&s;e you may think nece&s;&s;ary, till you have fini&s;hed the operation you were about, and laid the patient in bed.</P>
<P>Never encourage tho&s;e to &s;tay below (after their wounds, &amp;c. are dre&s;t) who have been but little hurt, but in&s;i&s;t on their going up again to their quarters, otherwi&s;e threaten to report them when the engage|ment is over. I have many times known cowardly lubbers come tumbling down the ladder with mo&s;t violent groans and com|plaints, though at the &s;ame time they have received little or no hurt; and all I could do or &s;ay would not prevail on them to make a &s;econd trial of their courage, nor go up again till the action was all over. Nay, I have been told (by tho&s;e quartered at the &s;ame gun) that &s;ome da&s;tardly-fel|lows have actually put their feet, or &s;tood
<PB N="135" REF="015100_0133_0F95D2FFED518448">
in the way of the carriage, on purpo&s;e to be hurt, that they might have a plau&s;ible pretence for going down to the doctor; which I mu&s;t own I have great rea&s;on to believe, having &s;ometimes met with &s;uch contu&s;ions in the legs and feet, occa&s;ioned (according to their own confe&s;&s;ion) by the carriage, but at the &s;ame time &s;o &s;light as was &s;carce worth mentioning; though &s;ometimes very violent, at other times there was &s;carce any injury or contu&s;ion to be perceived, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t grievous complaints of pain and unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When you are entering on any capital operation, you &s;hould u&s;e your utmo&s;t en|deavours to encourage the patient (if he is &s;en&s;ible) by promi&s;ing him, in the &s;ofte&s;t terms, to treat him tenderly, and to fini&s;h with the utmo&s;t expedition; and indeed you &s;hould u&s;e expedition but not hurry: you &s;hould not make more ha&s;te than the ca&s;e requires, nor cut le&s;s than is nece&s;&s;ary, or leave any mi&s;chief unremedied; for the neglecting this critical juncture of taking off a limb, frequently reduces the patient to &s;o low a &s;tate, and &s;ubjects the blood and juices to &s;uch an alteration, as mu&s;t unavoidably render the &s;ub&s;equent opera|tion, if not entirely un&s;ucce&s;sful, at lea&s;t exceedingly dubious. Therefore, if a
<PB N="136" REF="015100_0134_0F95D300ADA009D8">
wound be of &s;uch a de&s;perate nature as to require amputation (which is often the ca&s;e in &s;ea engagements) it is certainly of con&s;equence to perform the operation immediately as &s;oon as the man is brought down: and in wounds, even where no amputation is required, it is equally ad|vi&s;eable not to defer the care nece&s;&s;ary to be taken of them.</P>
<P>In regard to the wounded, you &s;hould act in all re&s;pects as if you were entirely unaffected by their groans and complaints; but at the &s;ame time I would have you be|have with &s;uch caution, as not to proceed ra&s;hly or cruelly, and be particularly care|ful to avoid unnece&s;&s;ary pain.</P>
<P>When the action is all over, you are then to go round your patients, and examine if the wounds have bled any thing con&s;ider|ably &s;ince they were dre&s;t; and if the haemorrhage &s;till continues, remove the dre&s;&s;ings very gently and carefully, and ap|ply fre&s;h ones.</P>
<P>It is not improper here to remark that the tourniquets &s;hould &s;till remain on tho&s;e patients, who have had their limbs amputated or &s;hot off; that they may be always in readine&s;s, in ca&s;e of a fre&s;h hae|morrhage; and in ca&s;e there be no a&s;&s;i&s;tant pre&s;ent when it happens, the patient &s;hould

<P>As &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after the engagement is ended, and your wounded are all taken proper care of, acquaint the captain how many there are wounded, and the nature of their wounds, if they are like to prove mortal, &amp;c. And de&s;ire he will plea&s;e to order cradles forthwith to be made, as ma|ny as you think nece&s;&s;ary, wherein your wounded men mu&s;t be placed, with their bedding, in a proper birth by them&s;elves. The cradles are fir&s;t to be well cleated, and &s;ecured to the deck and &s;ides of the &s;hip, placed &s;o, as that you may ea&s;ily go between to dre&s;s the people.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;hip arrives in a harbour, the &s;ick and wounded mu&s;t be immediately &s;ent on &s;hore, where their cures will be perfected in a much &s;horter time than it is po&s;&s;ible on board in an in&s;alubrious air, and on &s;uch diet only as the &s;hip affords.</P>

<HEAD>PREVENTATIVES OF THE SCURVY AT SEA, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE be&s;t method of preventing the Scurvy at Sea is a liberal u&s;e of acids (particularly tho&s;e of vegetables) and to avoid eating the &s;hips &s;alt provi&s;ions as much as po&s;&s;ible, to u&s;e friction daily, either with a fle&s;h-bru&s;h or coar&s;e cloth. Proper exerci&s;e, dry linen, and cleanline&s;s, not a little contribute to health.</P>
<P>It appears from many repeated experi|ments of Dr. Lind, and a number of Sur|geons in the royal navy, that of all acids, oranges and lemons have the be&s;t effect in
<PB N="139" REF="015100_0137_0F95D302EEFA65D0">
preventing and curing the Scurvy (the lat|ter I &s;hall here omit mentioning, it being already laid down in the Marine Surgeon, Vol. II. Chap. VIII. Sect. VI. Art. Scurvy, to which the reader is referred). Oranges, in my opinion, are better than lemons, for by the&s;e Lord An&s;on's people were &s;o &s;peed|ily and &s;urprizingly recovered at the i&s;land of Tinian. It is certain, when they are properly and &s;ufficiently u&s;ed, they are an infallible cure in every &s;tage and &s;pecies of the Scurvy, if there is any degree of natu|ral &s;trength left; and where a diarrhoea, lientery, or dy&s;entery are not joined to the other &s;ymptoms. Some are apt to think tamarinds, vinegar, &s;pirit of &s;alt, elixir of vitriol, and other acids of the &s;ame kind, will do as well; but experience (that be&s;t of ma&s;ters) plainly &s;hews the contrary; and though acids agree in certain proper|ties, they differ widely in others. When|ever the&s;e fruits are given without &s;ucce&s;s, you may be fully a&s;&s;ured the di&s;ea&s;e is not the Scurvy; for in the real genuine Scurvy they were never yet known to fail. How|ever it is nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to ob&s;erve that fre&s;h vegetables of all kind prove a great relief to &s;corbutic patients when &s;et on &s;hore.</P>
<P>But as oranges and lemons are apt to &s;poil in keeping, there is now to be had an
<PB N="140" REF="015100_0138_0F95D303AA4CB858">
excellent quinte&s;&s;ence of the&s;e fruits, which may be very advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed as a &s;uc|cedaneum, being but little inferior to the recent juice.</P>
<P>When you are in countries where oranges and lemons grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and can be procured in great plenty at a &s;mall ex|pence, I &s;hall here &s;hew how to bring their juices, by a very ea&s;y method, into a &s;mall quantity without prejudice to their virtues.</P>
<P>Let the juice of the&s;e fruits be well cleared from the pulp, and depurated by &s;tanding &s;ome time; after which it may be poured off from the gro&s;s &s;ediment: let it then be poured into any clean open ve&s;&s;el of china or &s;tone ware, which &s;hould be wider at the top than at the bottom, that it may evaporate more readily. A china ba&s;on or punch bowl is mo&s;t proper on account of the form. Put this into a pan of water over a clear fire; let the water come almo&s;t to boil, and continue nearly in that &s;tate, with the bowl full of juice in the middle of it, till the juice is found of the con&s;i&s;tence of a thick &s;yrup when cold. The &s;lower the evaporation of the juice is, the better; that is, it ought to continue twelve or fourteen hours over the fire: when it is cold it is to be corked up in a bottle for u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="015100_0139_0F95D30563BC73E8">Two dozen of good oranges, weighing five pounds four ounces, will yield one pound nine ounces and a half depurated juice; and when evaporated there will re|main five ounces of extract, which in bulk will be equal to le&s;s than three ounces of water: &s;o that twelve dozen of oranges or lemons may be put into a quart bottle, and pre&s;erved good &s;everal years. When this is mixed with water, and made into punch, few are able to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the fre&s;h juice mixed up in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>However, when the fre&s;h fruit can be had, the fragrancy of the peel may contri|bute &s;omewhat to the cure of the Scurvy; and when the&s;e are wanting, the &s;ame thing may be obtained from a few drops of their chymical e&s;&s;ence, or the aromatic oil con|tained in their rinds; and if a &s;mall quan|tity of this be added to the extract, it will give it the &s;mell and fragrancy of the fre&s;h fruit in great perfection: or rather add a little of the outer peel to the extract, a lit|tle before it is taken off the fire, and then the nice&s;t ta&s;te will not be able to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the difference between the fre&s;h fruit and this. The virtues of this extract, thus made, lie in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s, that a quart bottle full will &s;erve one man at &s;ea

<P>It will likewi&s;e be of great u&s;e to all &s;ea-faring people to have always with them, bullace, &s;loes, wild-plums, hips, elder|berries, goo&s;e-berries, and the like, pre|&s;erved in bottles, in the &s;ame manner as the pa&s;try-cooks keep the latter. Cabbage, French beans, &amp;c. may be pre&s;erved by putting them in clean dry &s;tone pots or jars, with a layer of &s;alt at the bottom, then a thin layer of the vegetable covered with &s;alt, and &s;o alternately till the pot is full; then the whole mu&s;t be pre&s;&s;ed down with a weight, and its mouth quite &s;topped with a cork or timber plug, well pitched over, that no air or moi&s;ture may enter: thus the vegetable may be kept fre&s;h and green for a whole year.</P>
<P>At the time of u&s;ing, the &s;alt is to be wa&s;hed off with warm water. This is the manner by which they pre&s;erve that never-failing remedy Greenland &s;curvy-gra&s;s. Every common &s;ailor &s;hould al&s;o lay in a &s;tock of onions and mu&s;tard, for they are a great pre&s;ervative at &s;ea. The Dutch &s;ailors are pre&s;erved from the Scurvy by pickled cabbage. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, likewi&s;e, that a &s;oup of boiled cabbage and onions will cure an adventitious Scurvy in

its fir&s;t &s;tage, either at land or &s;ea, in any part of the world; and what will cure will prevent.</P>
<P>Salt provi&s;ions &s;hould always be eaten with plenty of vinegar, mu&s;tard, and onions, but as little of the meat as po&s;&s;ible, e&s;pe|cially when the Scurvy begins to make its appearance in the &s;hip. Tho&s;e who have been weakened by long illne&s;s &s;hould be more particularly guarded again&s;t the Scur|vy, by living on boiled bi&s;cuit, with a few drops of the quinte&s;&s;ence or extract of le|mons or oranges, and a &s;poonful of wine; as al&s;o oatmeal and rice gruels, flummery, &s;tewed barley, with rai&s;ins or currants, &s;ago, and wine, &amp;c. But more particu|larly pickled green cabbage or beans, as before mentioned, and &s;mall onions boiled with the portable &s;oup made weak. Mo&s;t of their food ought to be acidulated with orange and lemon juice, their quinte&s;&s;ence or extract.</P>
<P>The in&s;pi&s;&s;ated juice of turnips (a thing very ea&s;ily and cheaply procured) is on ex|cellent kind of ingredient in &s;oup for &s;ea u&s;e. The water-dock (hydrolapathum) the berries mentioned above, and crab apples; al&s;o apples, pears, or any other fruit, either pre&s;erved with coar&s;e &s;ugar (by being boiled in it) or el&s;e brought to a

rob or extract, by boiling their expre&s;&s;ed juices, &amp;c. as already laid down for that of lemons and oranges, by which means it may be kept good through the longe&s;t voyages. Apples, pears, &amp;c. when well cho|&s;en, and well packed in dry tight ca&s;ks, will keep very good for two or three months; or they may otherwi&s;e be cut in &s;lices, and put upon &s;trings in dry weather, by which they will be dried without lo&s;ing their flavour or ta&s;te; they are then to be care|fully &s;towed in very dry boxes, and aired &s;ometimes to prevent their mouldering or being damaged.</P>
<P>Good wine may be made by fermenting the before-mentioned extracts with water and &s;ugar; bullace and &s;loes are preferable to any other (oranges and lemons excepted) being a noble anti&s;eptic a&s;tringent.</P>
<P>Poor people that winter in Greenland, under va&s;t di&s;advantages in point of air and diet, pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the Scurvy by &s;pruce beer.</P>
<P>The common beer brewed for the u&s;e of &s;hips &s;hould be imbittered with wormwood, chamomile flowers, or even gentian, rather than by means of hops; and by the for|mer it will keep longer than with the latter, without acquiring any bad property, and have full as agreeable a ta&s;te; but it &s;hould be
<PB N="145" REF="015100_0143_0F95D3083009A350">
plentifully impregnated with tho&s;e ingre|dients.</P>
<P>The &s;hrub black &s;pruce of America makes a mo&s;t whole&s;ome drink, and affords a bal|&s;am &s;uperior to mo&s;t turpentines; it is of the fir kind. A &s;imple decoction of the tops, cones, leaves, or even of the green bark, or wood of the&s;e, is an excellent anti&s;corbutic; but perhaps it is much more &s;o when fermented, as in making &s;pruce beer, which may be brewed fre&s;h every two or three days. It is to be made by pouring boiling water on the tops, cones, leaves, bark, or wood of the &s;pruce, or any other fir, dried or green; the latter may be ea&s;ily carried in bags at &s;ea: but when the&s;e cannot be had, a little turpentine or worm|wood may be &s;ub&s;tituted; which ever be u&s;ed, it is then to be fermented by the addi|tion of a proper quantity of mola&s;&s;es, which, by its diaphoretic quality, makes it a more &s;uitable medicine.</P>
<P>Again, when &s;pruce cannot be had, the common fir-tops u&s;ed for fuel in the &s;hip &s;hould be fir&s;t boiled in water, and then the decoction be fermented with mo|la&s;&s;es; to which may be added a &s;mall quantity of wormwood and root of hor&s;e|radi&s;h (when it can be got); the fre&s;her it is drank the better. When other things
<PB N="146" REF="015100_0144_0F95D308EB465A98">
are wanting, tar-water may be fermented in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>A drink may al&s;o be brewed the &s;ame way from the &s;a&s;&s;afras chips, or from the branches or berries of the juniper plant: for if the benefit is &s;uppo&s;ed to depend (as it certainly does) upon the fermentative quality, or to be derived from an ace&s;cent, anti&s;eptic, corro|borative, and bal&s;amic virtue in the reme|dy, what is more liberally endowed with the&s;e qualities than the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances I have mentioned?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides fre&s;h and pre&s;erved fruits, vege|tables, and the drinks above mentioned, fermented liquors of all &s;orts are good, but more particularly cyder; among the&s;e are included many wines of every kind; or the juices of fruits (already taken notice of) may be fermented with ale, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The late very learned and ju&s;tly cele|brated Doctor Huxham &s;ays, "Let all &s;hips, that are to proceed on a long crui&s;e or voyage, be &s;upplied with a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;ound generous cyder; the rougher, provided it is perfectly &s;ound, the better."</P>
<P>If apples are found of &s;uch va&s;t &s;ervice in the Scurvy, &s;urely the juice of them, when become a vinous liquor, cannot but
<PB N="147" REF="015100_0145_0F95D309ADDCBCE8">
be very &s;alutary, and &s;eems exceedingly well adapted, as a common drink, to correct by its acidity the alcale&s;cent, putrefying quality of bad, corrupted provi&s;ions. This cyder &s;hould be at lea&s;t three months old before it is &s;erved in, and quite fine; if it be too new, and foul, it is apt to give &s;evere colics: it &s;hould be racked off (once at lea&s;t) from its gro&s;s ley into good and &s;weet ve&s;&s;els, which will contribute to its becom|ing fine, and prevent it from growing ropy, in which &s;tate it is good for nothing: but if &s;ome of it &s;hould turn to vinegar, which may frequently happen, it will &s;till be very &s;erviceable; but it is found, when well managed, to keep good and &s;ound even to the Indies. Every &s;ailor &s;hould have at lea&s;t a pint of cyder a day, be&s;ides beer and water.</P>
<P>The prize wines, which are commonly low and thin, and very frequently &s;poil by keeping, might be di&s;tributed among the &s;hip's company (e&s;pecially in want of cyder) to very good purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The ventilators &s;hould be con&s;tantly worked, once a day at lea&s;t; and the decks frequently wa&s;hed or &s;prinkled with vine|gar. In ca&s;e of &s;tinking water, lemon juice, elixir of vitriol, or vinegar &s;hould always be mixed with it, which will render it
<PB N="148" REF="015100_0146_0F95D30A6C522930">
much le&s;s unwhole&s;ome. A &s;mall drachm of garlic brandy, or the tincture of bark, taken in the mornings fa&s;ting, and when going on the night watch, is a great pre|&s;ervation. See the next Chapter on the Pre&s;ervation of Health, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Cream of tartar, being the e&s;&s;ential ve|getable &s;alt of wine, is a very proper &s;uc|cedaneum when fruit is wanting; and orange or lemon peel (or its e&s;&s;ence) will greatly improve the flavour: be&s;ides cream of tartar is the mo&s;t grateful of all acids, &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of the juice of le|mons and oranges, and be&s;t adapted to the con&s;titution of mariners: it is al&s;o the cheap|e&s;t; for an allowance of the eighth part of an ounce a day will not co&s;t the govern|ment much more than one &s;hilling yearly for each man, or eighteen pence at mo&s;t. Two pounds and a half of cream of tartar will be &s;ufficient to acidulate an hog&s;head of water; this, with rum and &s;ugar, will become a &s;alutary compo&s;ition of a cooling, &s;trengthening, anti&s;eptic, and diuretic na|ture; for there is nothing more repre&s;&s;es the inflammatory and intoxicating power of &s;pirits than acids. Such a liquor would prove infinitely more whoel&s;ome than the grog, wherewith the navy is commonly

&s;erved when &s;pirits are u&s;ed, both in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The officers and men (that can afford it) &s;hould always carry to &s;ea a very con&s;iderable quantity of pickles of different kinds, par|ticularly onions; and pre&s;erves and extracts of all acid fruits, &s;uch as &s;loes, bullace, dam|&s;ons, &amp;c. They mu&s;t all be properly pre|&s;erved in gla&s;s bottles or &s;tone jars well tied over; glazed earthen ve&s;&s;els are very dan|gerous either for pre&s;erves or pickles.</P>
<P>Allowing cyder, &amp;c. to the fleet, in|deed, may be deemed a very expen&s;ive project; but where the lives of &s;o many brave and u&s;eful people are in the ca&s;e, I think (as Dr. Huxham very humanely ob|&s;erved) the co&s;t &s;hould by no means come into competition with the advantage that may be received from it. The Romans con&s;tantly carried with them vinegar and wine in their fleets and armies, and the common &s;oldier and &s;ailor daily partook of both; nay, they were at many other con|&s;iderable expences to pre&s;erve the health of their armies, &amp;c. New, if that glorious prudent people thought the life of a Ro|man &s;oldier &s;o valuable, and were at &s;uch expence to pre&s;erve it, why &s;hould not we have as much regard to that of a Briti&s;h

&s;ailor, who is altogether as brave, and as u&s;eful to the Common wealth?</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary here al&s;o to remark, that the u&s;ual method of impre&s;&s;ing &s;eamen on their return from long and tedious voyages, void of nece&s;&s;aries, chagrined at not &s;eeing their friends and families, and mo&s;t com|monly in a bad &s;tate of health, and not allowed time and opportunity to recover it, hath been the bane of thou&s;ands: and I mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h, for the honor of the nation and the good of the public, that a method of manning our fleet could be found out more con&s;i&s;tent with common humanity and Briti&s;h liberty; and like|wi&s;e to have it &s;erved with more whole|&s;ome provi&s;ion, better beer, and a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;ound generous cyder on board every &s;hip, to be u&s;ed at di&s;cretion, and as nece&s;&s;ity required; from the foregoing re|marks it is evident what advantages would accrue from it.</P>

<HEAD>RULES FOR PRESERVING HEALTH, IN WARM, AND COLD CLIMATES, BY DOCTOR LIND, and SURGEON NORTHCOTE.</HEAD>
<P>HEAT it&s;elf is not &s;o prejudicial to Health as is generally imagined; but when joined to moi&s;ture it is remark|ed, that it occa&s;ions the mo&s;t fatal di&s;|tempers in all warm climates.</P>
<P>When a &s;hip rides at anchor near mar&s;hy ground or &s;wamps, and the wind blows di|rectly from thence in hot weather, the gun ports ought to be kept &s;hut; and if &s;he rides with her head to the wind, a thick &s;moke &s;ail &s;hould be con&s;tantly kept up to the fore|ma&s;t, to carry up the &s;moke of the galley, and prevent its coming aft over the &s;hip: at &s;uch times the men &s;hould be injoined to &s;moke tobacco, and the &s;hip &s;hould often be fumigated with it, as well as with pitch and tar; the method of procuring tobacco to be &s;o u&s;ed, without any additional ex|pence to the government, is, in&s;tead of burning the great quantities every year &s;eiz|ed by the co&s;tom-hou&s;e and exci&s;e-officers, to order it to be pre&s;erved, and &s;ent to the dock yards to &s;upply the &s;hips de&s;tined for foreign voyages; it may be either added to the boat&s;wain's or carpenter's &s;tores, in &s;uch large quantities as may be thought convenient for the above u&s;e of fumigating: to prevent
<PB N="152" REF="015100_0150_0F95D30D6B8C4508">
abu&s;e, it &s;hould never be u&s;ed without the captain's order, and always i&s;&s;ued out by weight; it would likewi&s;e be proper that centinels &s;hould attend the burning it to prevent embezzlement, which precaution in my opinion would be of infinite advantage on many occa&s;ions, and a much more pru|dent way than the pre&s;ent method of con|&s;uming it, without the lea&s;t benefit accruing to any individual.</P>
<P>Boats crews and men employed on &s;hore, being mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the open air, &s;hould be often relieved, and never &s;uffered to &s;leep on &s;hore, not even in tents or otherwi&s;e, if to be avoided; but &s;hould always be obliged to return and lie aboard at night: but when this cannot be complied with, and men are obliged to remain on &s;hore, their tents &s;hould be very clo&s;e, and erected on the drye&s;t &s;pot they can find, that is, upon dry &s;and, gravel, or chalk, near the &s;ea &s;hore. The negroes, and &s;ome of the Indians on the coa&s;t of Guinea, both of whom &s;leep on the ground, have con&s;tantly a fire producing a little &s;moke burning in the huts where they &s;leep, which corrects the moi&s;ture of the night, and renders the damp of the earth le&s;s noxious; therefore if your tent is made on the gra&s;s, and at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea|&s;hore, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the &s;ame rule: the door of the tent &s;hould be towards the &s;ea, and the back part &s;ecured
<PB N="153" REF="015100_0151_0F95D30E2CEF5390">
by double canvas. All old for&s;aken hou&s;es, caves, and &s;uch like places, &s;hould be well purified with large fires; the men &s;hould never &s;leep on the ground, but in their hammocks, and be very well covered; every morning and evening they &s;hould take a dram of the &s;pirituous tincture of the bark: likewi&s;e the officers and men, when on &s;hore, &s;hould be allowed a more plentiful, but not immoderate u&s;e of vinous liquors.</P>
<P>Dr. LIND &s;ays, that people coming fir&s;t from a cold into a hot climate, are apt to have plethoric &s;ymptoms (which in general I have found to be the ca&s;e in many &s;outhern voyages, with &s;ome few exceptions) a pain of the head, giddi|ne&s;s, a &s;en&s;e of the weight, and fulne&s;s of the brea&s;t, and &s;ome are apt to be &s;eized with ardent fevers and diarrhoeas.</P>
<P>All practitioners have ob&s;erved, that new comers into warm climates are at fir&s;t liable to fevers tending to the ardent kind, and are very &s;ubject to fevers of the remitting and intermitting kind, which are the en|demics of all warm countries at certain &s;ea|&s;ons of the year; and after &s;ome time they are apt to fall into fluxes, the yellow-fever, and othe di&s;ea&s;es depending on a putre&s;cent &s;tate of the juices.</P>
<P>Nothing has been found to be more pro|ductive of di&s;ea&s;es in tho&s;e warm climates, than indulging freely in the u&s;e of &s;pirits and
<PB N="154" REF="015100_0152_0F95D30EEC570F18">
other &s;trong fermented liquors, lying on the ground, being expo&s;ed to damps and dews, and working hard, or u&s;ing violent exerci&s;e in the heat of the day.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t dangerous di&s;ea&s;es in intem|perate climates, and voyages to the &s;outh|ward, proceed from a continuance of hot, moi&s;t, clo&s;e weather, or from heavy rains, common at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of the year be|tween the Tropics; at fir&s;t a few of the men are &s;eized with the bloody-flux, which is &s;ucceeded by a malignant fever of the remitting or intermitting kind, but mo&s;t commonly it is like a double tertian: this is epidemic between the Tropics, and is the autumnal fever of all hot countries; the &s;afety of the patient entirely depends on the fever's intermitting, or at lea&s;t on its remitting &s;o much as to allow an opportu|nity of throwing in the bark, which is the only &s;overeign remedy in the&s;e &s;ort of ma|lignant fevers, though they put on differ|ent appearances.</P>
<P>The bark might be made extremely pa|latable by infu&s;ing it in &s;pirits with orange peel, and the billious fever and the bloody flux might be prevented by it: four ounces of bark and two ounces of dried orange peel will be &s;ufficient for a gallon of &s;pirits; and two ounces may be allowed each man a day when there is an apprehen&s;ion of the&s;e malignant di&s;ea&s;es: it will be be&s;t to
<PB N="155" REF="015100_0153_0F95D30FAD6F6C88">
take half in the morning on an empty &s;to|mach, and the other half when they are called out to their night watch.</P>
<P>The bark is an excellent medicine for &s;ailors on many accounts, it being the greate&s;t anti&s;eptic taken inwardly of any yet di&s;covered; but as it is a very expen&s;ive drug in England, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;hips will carry &s;uch a quantity of it as to be of common benefit to the whole crew: though this may unhappily be the ca&s;e for the poor &s;eamen, yet they may be &s;upplied at the cheape&s;t rate with a medicine of nearly equal goodne&s;s and efficacy from our own &s;oil, and if prudently employed, the &s;curvy, that maritime pe&s;tilence, will &s;eldom or never make its alarming appear|ance among a &s;hip's crew on long and dan|gerous voyages, proper care with regard to cleanline&s;s and provi&s;ions being ob&s;erved; the medicine here recommended to their u&s;e is the fine bark of the Engli&s;h oak, which is ea&s;ily pre&s;erved, and may be con|veniently taken in the quantity of a drachm at a time, occa&s;ionally in powder, extract, decoction, or tincture. In intermittents (for poor people) it has been frequently u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that in &s;ultry climates, or during hot weather in all places &s;ubject to great rains, where the country is over-run by thickets, &s;hrubs, or
<PB N="156" REF="015100_0154_0F95D3106A232F88">
woods, e&s;pecially if there are mar&s;hes or &s;tagnating waters in the neighbourhood (which are exceedingly pernicious to the health of all Europeans) the malignant di&s;ea&s;es above-mentioned may ju&s;tly be dreaded: the fens and mar&s;hes even in England are bad for &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The &s;hip &s;hould never lie &s;o near the &s;hore, as that the mountains (if there be any) may intercept the &s;ea breezes (or in the &s;ea term, &s;he &s;hould never be land lock'd); the &s;ame precautions are nece&s;&s;ary in places, either during or &s;oon after the rainy &s;ea&s;on: in hot climates wind-&s;ails in in the day-time &s;hould con&s;tantly be kept up, and at &s;ea in the night likewi&s;e; the ventilators &s;hould be continually worked, and the lower deck ports kept open, when the weather will permit, from &s;un ri&s;ing to &s;un-&s;et; the decks mu&s;t be kept clean &s;craped and wa&s;hed, but the latter never after &s;un-&s;et. When &s;ickne&s;s begins on board a &s;hip, the &s;ick &s;hould immediately be removed as much as conveniently may be from the &s;ound; the &s;ick-birth &s;hould be as airy as po&s;&s;ible, without expo&s;ing the &s;ick to catch cold, and always kept as clean as may be; the centinels over the &s;ick &s;hould con&s;tantly empty and wa&s;h the buc|kets which the &s;ick make u&s;e of every watch.</P>
<P>The &s;hip (particularly a new one) &s;hould
<PB N="157" REF="015100_0155_0F95D31222EEE2E8">
be every day fumigated with the &s;teams of tar or pitch, and in wet, damp weather, fires often lighted between decks, with proper centinels over them to prevent any danger.</P>
<P>To boil vinegar between decks or in the hold fills the whole cavity of the hull with a vapour that is &s;alutary and anti&s;eptic to a very great degree; and this may perhaps be the be&s;t way of u&s;ing vinegar to prevent a corruption of the air, or the &s;preading of di&s;ea&s;es; fumes of tobacco (as already men|tioned) may be employed to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e with good &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The cloaths of the &s;ick and the &s;ick birth ought particularly to be fumigated; their foul cloaths &s;hould always be in&s;tantly &s;prinkled with vinegar, or tied to a rope and plunged into the &s;ea, to wa&s;h them from all &s;eeds of contagion; vinegar &s;hould al&s;o be di&s;per&s;ed plentifully every where through the &s;hip, cloths dipt in it hung up in all parts, and fre&s;h vinegar frequently &s;prinkled upon them, to keep the vapour of it continually afloat, but e&s;pecially the &s;ick birth ought to be daily well wa&s;hed with vinegar.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of cold bathing-tubs under the fore ca&s;tle, and bathing in the &s;ea early in the morning, have been found extremely beneficial in hot countries, for this practice
<PB N="158" REF="015100_0156_0F95D312AB0C2C10">
not only braces up the fibres, and contri|butes to health but cleanline&s;s likewi&s;e, and promotes per&s;piration; but then the people &s;hould not &s;tay too long in the water, nor go in when overheated with work or liquor, nor when the &s;tomach is full, or there is an eruption with a prickly heat on the &s;kin. Diarrhoeas and other complaints, the ef|fects of great heat, have been cured by bathing, and their returns prevented.</P>
<P>Wine is the be&s;t of all cordials in the de|cline of fevers, (provided it is &s;ound and good) and is a much better re&s;torative than rum, or any other &s;pirits however mixed or prepared; it is likewi&s;e an excellent means to prevent infection; &s;ome ca&s;ks of Madeira Wine (which keeps good in all climates) &s;hould be pre&s;erved for the u&s;e of the &s;ick in the&s;e voyages.</P>
<P>The &s;wallowing large draughts of undi|luted &s;pirits has always the mo&s;t fatal con|&s;equences in every climate; but when they are converted into punch, they become very &s;alutary, preventing di&s;ea&s;es which a|ri&s;e from hot and moi&s;t weather, and the tendency to corruption in the animal fluids, which is con&s;tantly induced thereby; as cleanline&s;s alone greatly contributes to health, it may not be ami&s;s to propo&s;e, that when at &s;ea, the &s;eamen and marines &s;hould be mu&s;tered when the &s;eparate watches are called every Sunday, and pa&s;s

<P>I &s;hall here only mention that when men are &s;eized with inflammatory &s;ymptoms on entering into warm climates, they may be blooded freely; afterwards they do not ea&s;ily bear &s;uch copious evacuations, but rather require to have them made in &s;maller quantities, and very early and frequent, as it flammations make a rapid progre&s;s in warm countries.</P>
<P>Doctor Lind &s;ays, many practitioners di&s;approve of bleeding in tho&s;e countries which lie under the torrid zone, on a &s;up|po&s;ition that the blood is too much di&s;&s;olv|ed, but he thinks (very ju&s;tly) that this
<PB N="160" REF="015100_0158_0F95D3142B0FF0E8">
rule will admit of many exceptions, and that &s;ailors being &s;trong and expo&s;ed to greater vici&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold, and more exce&s;&s;es and other accidents, bear freer bleeding in general than any other &s;et of people. After &s;ome time the di&s;ea&s;es in the&s;e warm climates tend to the putrid kind, and then mu&s;t be treated as &s;uch.</P>
<P>In warm climates the &s;hips are generally mo&s;t healthy at &s;ea, where the air is dry and &s;erene, and the heat moderated by refre&s;hing breezes.</P>

<HEAD>RULES FOR PRESERVING HEALTH, IN COLD CLIMATES.</HEAD>
<P>IN northern climates and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hannel cruiz|ing, though the cold is inten&s;e, yet if the air is pure and dry and the men are well cloathed, there are few di&s;ea&s;es; but when the weather is un&s;ettled, cloudy, wet and rainy, the u&s;ual con&s;equences are colds, attended with feveri&s;h and inflam|matory &s;ymptoms, and e&s;pecially rheu|matic, pleuritic, and peripneumonic com|plaints, the&s;e ia&s;t require plentiful evacu|ations, but chiefly bleeding, which, when timely and freely u&s;ed, will prevent con|&s;umptions and chronic rheumati&s;ms.</P>
<P>When the men are almo&s;t con&s;tantly wet and chill from bad weather, and un|dergo an uncommon degree of fatigue, it

will be proper to let them have the follow|ing mixture, viz. a pint of &s;mall beer, and a quartern of brandy &s;weetened with mo|la&s;&s;es, to which may be added as much vinegar as will render the mixture palata|ble; or, in&s;tead of the la&s;t, cream of tar|tar; this the Ru&s;&s;ians call <HI>a&s;hbetten.</HI> Dry beds and cloathing are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary arti|cles; for it is ob&s;ervable that the mo&s;t naked ragged fellows are principally at|tacked with winter di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;curvy is a di&s;ea&s;e common in the winter and &s;pring; the method to prevent which is already laid down in the preceding &s;ection, and to which the reader is referred.</P>
<P>Dr. Lind &s;ays, the mo&s;t proper cordial dram a &s;ailor can u&s;e in the winter is gar|lic brandy, for a &s;mall quantity of it, not only warms the &s;tomach, but keeps the brea&s;t, kidneys, and &s;kin free from ob&s;truc|tions; but neither this nor any other dram &s;hould be given to a man almo&s;t chilled to death with cold, having his limbs quite benumbed, and their extremities fro&s;t bit (as it is called); for, in this ca&s;e, it has often proved fatal; but he &s;hould be im|mediately put into a warm bed, and have &s;ome warm gruel, &s;age tea, or &s;ome &s;uch diluting liquor, given him; after which a dram may be allowed, when it will prove le&s;s dangerous, and more beneficial.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="015100_0160_0F95D315AD2EAE50">A very remarkable ca&s;e to this purpo&s;e is related by Hildanus, viz. a man was found quite &s;tiff and frozen all over; he was put into cold water, and immediately the icy &s;picula were di&s;charged from all parts of his body, &s;o that he &s;eemed covered with an icy cru&s;t; he was then put into a warm bed, took a cordial draught, and a plentiful &s;weat followed; after which he recovered with the lo&s;s of the la&s;t joints of his fingers and toes. De Gang aena, chap. XIII.</P>
<P>People who are benumbed with cold in fro&s;ty weather, ought never to be brought immediately near a fire; for that has been found either to cau&s;e immediate death, or gangrenes of the extremities. Any kind of fruit frozen, when put immediately to the fire, will turn &s;oft and rot; but if put into cold water, it throws out the icy &s;picula, and recovers &s;o as to be almo&s;t as good as before, which, proves the above method u&s;ed with the man to be right.</P>
<P>In cold rainy weather, tea made with &s;age, &s;a&s;&s;afra&s;, or a few roa&s;ted juniper ber|ries, with the addition of a little garlic brandy, will be very beneficial; likewi&s;e a man will never be &s;o liable to catch cold when he is wet upon the deck, and u&s;es exerci&s;e, as when he is below in his wet cloaths, or &s;leep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in them, or in a damp bed; when he goes upon deck he &s;hould
<PB N="163" REF="015100_0161_0F95D3166DC4A8D8">
eat a bit of bi&s;cuit, and drink a little a&s;hbet|ten, and then the weather will probably have but little power to alter his health for the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>When a &s;ailor happens to be dead drunk, his head &s;hould be rai&s;ed, and a &s;punge dipped in vinegar &s;hould be held to his no&s;e; and if he can drink, he &s;hould have warm water mixed with vinegar; bleeding will likewi&s;e be proper, and a gentle emetic which operates &s;peedily, &s;uch as the oxymel. &s;cillitic. &s;al vitriol. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e dipping the feet in cold water will take off the pre&s;&s;ure from the brain; and &s;olutive cly&s;ters will abate the di&s;ten|&s;ion; it is but too well known how many people lo&s;e their lives by exce&s;&s;ive drinking, and &s;pirituous liquors; the &s;ame treatment will be u&s;eful after a large do&s;e of opium.</P>
<P>The&s;e methods here laid down (chiefly taken from Doctor Lind) but partly from others, I have practi&s;ed for many years in the royal navy; and with the ble&s;&s;ing of God it has in general been attended with great &s;ucce&s;s; for which rea&s;on I can the more &s;trongly recommend it; if it be true, as was publi&s;hed in December 1760, taken as is &s;uppo&s;ed from returns made to the Hou&s;e of Commons, that of 185,000 men, rai&s;ed for the &s;ea-&s;ervice during the late war, above 130,000 peri&s;hed by di&s;ea&s;es; and that two thirds of this number may be &s;afely charged
<PB N="164" REF="015100_0162_0F95D3172DA30390">
to the account of di&s;ea&s;es that take their ri&s;e from putrefaction; &s;urely every motive of policy and humanity &s;hould excite men to endeavour at finding out &s;omewhat to check that fatal and de&s;tructive diathe&s;is; for if &s;ea|men could be pre&s;erved free from it other kinds of di&s;ea&s;es would &s;eldom endanger them.</P>
