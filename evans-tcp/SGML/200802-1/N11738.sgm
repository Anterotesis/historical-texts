<P>And Jacob &s;aid, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father I&s;aac, the Lord which &s;aid&s;t unto me, Return unto thy country and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: I am not worthy of the lea&s;t of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou ha&s;t &s;hewed unto thy &s;ervant; for with my &s;taff I pa&s;&s;ed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.

<P>FROM the time of God's entering into co|venant with Abraham, it became nece&s;&s;ary that the father of each family &s;hould, at the clo&s;e of life, convene his children to inform them in what line the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham was to de|&s;cend, as he the father had been in&s;tructed by God. The promi&s;ed &s;eed being explicitly declared to be in I&s;aac, there was no occa&s;ion for Abraham's do|ing this; but when I&s;aac was advanced in age and in the decline of life, he thought proper to pro|nounce his ble&s;&s;ing upon his &s;ons, and proceeded without having received any &s;pecial direction from heaven. I&s;aac being partial towards E&s;au, e&s;peci|ally
<PB N="6" REF="014831_0004_0F978A16ACA9F1D8">
becau&s;e he provided him with Veni&s;on, called him unto him. Rebeckah, I&s;aac's wife, perceiving that he was about to promi&s;e the ble&s;&s;ing of Abra|ham not to the per&s;on for whom it was de&s;igned, re&s;olved if po&s;&s;ible to prevent it; &s;he accordingly concerts a &s;cheme for Jacob's obtaining the ble&s;&s;ing: The artifice we find related in Gen. xxvii. E&s;au upon this <HI>hated Jacob and &s;aid in his heart, the days of mourning for his father were at hand, then would he &s;lay his brother Jacob</HI>; which led Rebeckah to apply her&s;elf to I&s;aac, &s;hew the unhappine&s;s of E&s;au's con|nections, and the plea&s;ure they might promi&s;e them|&s;elves in Jacob if he would di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf better; her governing de&s;ign was to get Jacob out of the way of E&s;au. I&s;aac <HI>called Jacob, ble&s;&s;ed him, and &s;ent him away to Padan Aram, unto Laban</HI> the <HI>brother of Rebeckah,</HI> directing him to <HI>take a wife of his daugh|ters</HI>; Jacob <HI>went out from Beer&s;heba</HI> agreeable to his father's direction, <HI>went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the Ea&s;t,</HI> and arrived at the hou&s;e of Laban, where he married his daughters Rachel and Leah. After twenty years he was di|rected by God to <HI>return unto the land of his fathers and to his kindred,</HI> and he with his &s;ons and wives retired &s;ecretly. Laban following, overtook him, and when, after &s;ome conference, Laban departed, Jacob recollecting the di&s;plea&s;ure of E&s;au his bro|ther, <HI>&s;ent me&s;&s;engers to him that he might find grace in his &s;ight.</HI> The me&s;&s;engers upon their return in|crea&s;ed the fears of Jacob, and alarmed him greatly by telling him that E&s;au <HI>was coming to meet him,</HI> at|tended with four hundred men: Mi&s;apprehending the de&s;ign of E&s;au, he contrived the mo&s;t likely means of defence and &s;afety; and, as in the text, applied to God for &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

In the cour&s;e of providence he was his <HI>&s;hield and exceeding great re|ward</HI>; he influenced Melchizedeck King of Salem, to <HI>ble&s;s him</HI>; when the cities of the plain were de|&s;troyed he remembered Abraham, and warned Lot his brother to flee; he interpo&s;ed once and again with regard to a deception re&s;pecting his wife, in|fluencing Abimeleck to offer him a &s;ettlement in his land, and was at all times at his right hand.</P>
<P>That the Lord was the God of I&s;aac likewi&s;e appears from his promi&s;ing to <HI>be with him and ble&s;s him, to perform the oath which he &s;ware unto Abraham his father, and to multiply his &s;eed.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxvi.3, 24.</NOTE> By the inter|po&s;ition of divine Providence <HI>his</HI> life was pre&s;erved when to appearance in imminent danger; and <HI>he</HI> pro&s;pered and flouri&s;hed.

<P>From what we have already &s;een of Jacob, it is evident that the Lord was his God.</P>
<P>There was then a propriety in Jacob's addre&s;&s;ing the &s;upreme Being in the&s;e characters, and warming his heart with a recollection of God's favourable regards to his family. There is in the prayer of the text</P>
<P N="2">2. An acknowledgment of unworthine&s;s of pa&s;t

favours. <HI>I am not worthy of the lea&s;t of all the mer|cies and of all the truth which thou ha&s;t &s;hewed unto thy &s;ervant; for with my &s;taff I pa&s;sed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.</HI></P>
<P>The mercy of God towards Jacob in having di|rected a method of evading the immediate re&s;ent|ment of E&s;au, his pre&s;ence with him to Haran, a kind reception by Laban, &s;ucceeding in his de&s;ign, and his pro&s;perity upon the whole while with La|ban, with the repeated promi&s;es of God and his truth and faithfulne&s;s in the performance of them, of the&s;e <HI>mercies</HI> of God and of <HI>all the truth &s;hewed unto</HI> him, Jacob very humbly acknowledges him&s;elf <HI>not worthy.</HI> And particularly of one expre&s;&s;ion of God's goodne&s;s he deems him&s;elf unworthy; when he <HI>went out from Beer&s;heba,</HI> he went as a traveller, having no more than nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion, and the <HI>&s;taff</HI> in his hand, but when he returns he has <HI>people with him, and flocks, and herds, and camels,</HI> which for defence and &s;afety he is able to <HI>divide into two bands.</HI></P>
<P>It was fit and proper that Jacob &s;hould by re|cognizing the mercies and truth of God, impre&s;s his mind with a &s;en&s;e of his dependance upon him, e&s;pecially when about to a&s;k any favour at his hand.</P>

<P>Jacob knowing the promi&s;es that God made to his fathers Abraham and I&s;aac, and having ob|&s;erved his faithfulne&s;s to <HI>them,</HI> recollecting the re|peated promi&s;es and the truth of God to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> has a &s;trong faith; he confides in the veracity of God, and is encouraged to hope for &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In this part of his prayer, he refers to a &s;ea&s;on|able relief afforded him &s;ome years before; altho' he was the heir of a powerful family, we have &s;een that he was obliged to take his leave of his aged parents, and depart from his father's hou&s;e, for fear of an angry brother; the night following, as it is repre&s;ented, his undertaking this journey to Haran, that beneficent Being who &s;urrounds the bed and path of every individual, a&s;&s;ured him of his kind protection; a &s;ublime repre&s;entation filled the mind of Jacob! a repre&s;entation of a ladder extending from earth to heaven, with angels de&s;cending and a&s;cending upon it, and emblematical of a particular Providence! <HI>Behold, the Lord &s;tood above this ladder and &s;aid, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of I&s;aac; the land whereon thou lie&s;t, to thee will I give it, and to thy &s;eed.

<P>The words thus opened offer the&s;e ob&s;ervations,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That although our beginning be but &s;mall, our latter end may increa&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the pro&s;perity of any &s;ociety or com|munity depends upon public virtue, while di&s;tre&s;s and trouble will be connected with vice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That prayer is a proper exerci&s;e in a day of trouble. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That our &s;tate may be &s;o mixed as to afford us rea&s;on for mourning, as well as rejoicing.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The fir&s;t ob&s;ervation, That although our be|ginning be but &s;mall, our latter end may increa&s;e, is true, whether applied to individuals or &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>It is verified in Abraham, in I&s;aac, and in Jacob, which has been already cur&s;orily mentioned; and daily ob&s;ervation will furni&s;h many in&s;tances of per|&s;ons ri&s;ing from poverty to affluence, and from ob&s;curity to eminence and di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Societies have, no le&s;s than individuals, ro&s;e from &s;mall beginnings to large increa&s;e; for the truth of which, we need have recour&s;e to no other people but our own: Our fathers but few in number, yet how have we increa&s;ed! their territories but &s;mall, yet how are they enlarged! poor, yet how rich now! trifling then, yet how important now to the parent &s;tate! though our beginning was but &s;mall
<PB N="11" REF="014831_0009_0F978A1B0E4F6BF0">
in all re&s;pects, yet what &s;trides! what advances! and how great the acce&s;&s;ion! The truth of the re|mark is thus obvious at the fir&s;t &s;ight.</P>
<P>But as a probability is not immediately connected with the po&s;&s;ibility of our &s;till continuing to increa&s;e, I &s;hall immediately proceed to the &s;econd ob&s;erva|tion; and &s;hew the ground of that probability, which is righteou&s;ne&s;s or public virtue.</P>
<P>That pro&s;perity is intimately connected with public virtue, is a matter of which we ought to be well a&s;certained; and &s;o on the contrary that trou|ble will follow vice.</P>
<P>It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;upreme Being &s;hould call men to account AS members of &s;ociety, and di&s;pen&s;e rewards and puni&s;hments as his ju&s;tice &s;hould direct: and THAT in this world, becau&s;e we are not held <HI>by &s;ocieties and bodies of men</HI> to an&s;wer for our conduct in another world. God di&s;po&s;es and inclines us to form &s;ocial and civil connections, and has given us laws and commands to govern our&s;elves by in tho&s;e connections; and upon a regard to tho&s;e laws and commands, or public virtue, does the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of any people depend. Thus we find that when <HI>the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah</HI> was <HI>great,</HI> when <HI>their &s;in was very grievous,</HI> the Lord went <HI>down to &s;ee whether</HI> the inhabitants <HI>had done altogether according to the cry which had come unto him,</HI> and upon enquiry find|ing that wickedne&s;s had become univer&s;al, that they were unanimous in iniquity, and were <HI>&s;inners ex|ceedingly before</HI> him, he <HI>rained upon them brim&s;tone and fire out of heaven,</HI> and <HI>overthrew the cities and all their inhabitants and that which grew upon the ground.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, Babylon that glory of kingdoms and prai&s;e of the whole earth, <HI>&s;hall be,</HI> &s;ays the pro|phet
<PB N="12" REF="014831_0010_0F978A1BDC5D1BC0">
I&s;aiah, <HI>as when God overthrew Sodom and Go|morrah</HI>; and this for their iniquity, for the puni&s;h|ment of their &s;in.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es promi&s;ed the people of I&s;rael that if they would <HI>diligently hearken to the voice of God, ob&s;erve and do all his commandments,</HI> they &s;hould be &s;afe and ea&s;y; their families &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed with abun|dance; &s;ucce&s;s &s;hould attend them in all their em|ployments; they &s;hould have honour among their neighbours, and be victorious over their enemies. But on the contrary, if they would not keep God's commandments, his di&s;plea&s;ure would overtake them; they &s;hould be vi&s;ited with &s;ickne&s;s and fa|mine; they &s;hould be &s;o infatuated in their coun|&s;els as not to di&s;cern their true intere&s;t, nor effect any thing for the public good; and their name &s;hould be for <HI>an a&s;toni&s;hment.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Henry upon Deuter. 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>But a que&s;tion may here ari&s;e, viz. Whether this connection between vice and mi&s;ery, virtue and happine&s;s is not in con&s;equence of that political co|venant between God and I&s;rael, and &s;o <HI>peculiar</HI> to that people? and whether it be ju&s;t to argue from thence, that the pro&s;perity of a people or &s;ociety depends upon their obeying the commandments of God, while adver&s;ity will be the con&s;equence of their di&s;obedience? In an&s;wer to which it may be &s;aid, that it is the will of God, who always con&s;ults the good of his creatures, that we &s;hould incorpo|rate our&s;elves into larger &s;ocieties than tho&s;e which every family of it&s;elf forms; our general &s;ecurity and happine&s;s could not otherwi&s;e have been pro|moted, nor could we have been furni&s;hed with the conveniences of life. It is highly ju&s;t and rea&s;on|able, that God &s;hould take cognizance of, and call men to account in this their capacity as &s;ocieties;
<PB N="13" REF="014831_0011_0F978A1C924C4BB0">
di&s;tributing upon the whole body rewards or pu|ni&s;hments, and a&s;&s;igning them to adver&s;ity or pro&s;|perity, according to the nature of their united con|duct. Seeing the bonds of &s;ociety are di&s;&s;olved by death, after which per&s;onal characters only will be examined, this bu&s;ine&s;s (as has already been ob|&s;erved) will be tran&s;acted in this world. There is a greater nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a di&s;tribution taking place <HI>here,</HI> than there is of that with re&s;pect to per&s;onal characters; for although God often &s;uffers wicked men to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed here, they cannot e&s;cape his notice on the day of general judgment; but communities and &s;ocieties, as &s;uch, can never be puni&s;hed or rewarded, except in this world.</P>
<P>According to the common method of providence, the &s;tate of a people is good or bad according to the general nature of their actions; if they are careful to plea&s;e God, good and virtuous, ju&s;t and merciful, they flouri&s;h and are happy; but on the other hand, if profanity and impiety gain footing among them, a cloud &s;its upon their affairs, and calamity, ruin and de&s;truction &s;oon follow. Such ob&s;ervations have found entertainment in the minds of men in all ages; the decay of the Roman &s;tate was attributed
<Q>not to chance, fortune or &s;ome unhidden cau&s;es, but to the general loo&s;ene&s;s and corruption of manners.</Q>
And it was re|marked by Scipio,
<Q>that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any &s;tate to be happy though their walls were firm, if their manners were decayed.</Q></P>
<P>That God <HI>does</HI> charge guilt upon nations as well as particular per&s;ons or individuals, is implied in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture; when Abner had re|volted to David, David &s;aid, <HI>I and my kingdom are guiltle&s;s before the Lord,</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. iii.28.</NOTE> &amp;c. and when upon Am|non's

<P>Virtue promotes the honour of a people abroad, and will engage the confidence of di&s;tant nations and higher powers; it prevents private animo&s;ities and civil di&s;cord at home, it exhilerates the &s;pirits and in&s;pires with courage and magnanimity; it is a &s;ecu|rity and defence again&s;t the greate&s;t dangers; and wherever we find it is generally countenanced and encouraged, <HI>there</HI> we find the good of the whole is promoted; there the peaceable enjoyment of the comforts of life is allowed, and the true end of civil exi&s;tence is an&s;wered. On the contrary, vice renders a people de&s;picable in the eyes of the world; depre&s;&s;es the &s;pirits, and introduces confu&s;ion at home; and expo&s;es to the greate&s;t evils. When the former takes place in a &s;ociety, people or nation, that nation, people or &s;ociety will flouri&s;h; <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv.34.</NOTE> &s;ays the wi&s;e man. But when the latter, <HI>it is a reproach,</HI> and calls for divine judgments.</P>
<P>The judgments either feared or felt in &s;uch a ca&s;e, can be averted only by reformation.</P>
<P>Which leads to the</P>

<P><Q>There is a natural propen&s;ity in the mind of man,</Q>

<P>I have now cur&s;orily run over tho&s;e circum&s;tances which call for mourning; let us change the view, and recollect the rea&s;ons we have for rejoicing.</P>
<P>We of this land, have been the peculiar care of Providence from our earlie&s;t periods; the tender mercies of God have been con&s;tantly over us; thro' the benignity of Providence, we have greatly flou|ri&s;hed; in general, the &s;ea&s;ons have been fruitful, and we have been ble&s;&s;ed with abundant provi&s;ion.</P>

<Q>in the mid&s;t of affliction, we are &s;urrounded with mercies.</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t and principal mercy to be regarded is this, that whereas many are involved in darkne&s;s, others debarred a free u&s;e of the &s;acred &s;criptures, and popery is making its &s;trides into the Northern parts of this continent,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Quebec Bill, in the letter and &s;pirit of it.</NOTE> we are &s;urrounded with the light of the go&s;pel, yet allowed acce&s;s to the &s;acred &s;criptures, and favoured with wor&s;hipping God as our con&s;ciences dictate to us.</P>

And let us not be diverted from an attentive regard to this our duty, by an apprehen&s;ion of certain inconve|niences which may occur under a new e&s;tabli&s;h|ment; con&s;idering that as the conte&s;t we are now engaged in, is &s;ingular and different from any other, &s;o we mu&s;t expect &s;ome unavoidable incidents; though trifling when put in a balance with peace and liberty, without which life would be an into|lerable burden.]</P>
<P>Finally, &s;eeing our help mu&s;t come from above, let us pour out our &s;ouls in language &s;imilar to that of the P&s;almi&s;t, and of Jacob in the text; "O God of our fathers, who in the times of old did&s;t drive out the heathen with thy hand, and planted&s;t them; by who&s;e right hand, by who&s;e arm, and by the light of who&s;e countenance they were &s;upported; thou art our king, O God. We are not worthy of the lea&s;t of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou ha&s;t &s;hewed unto thy &s;ervants, for we have ri&s;en from the &s;malle&s;t beginnings, have been che|ri&s;hed, &s;upported and greatly enlarged by thy hand; but few pa&s;&s;ed over to this land, and attended with very few of the conveniences of life, and now we are become many bands. Deliver us, we pray thee, from the hand of our brethren, for they have come and &s;mote us."</P>
<P>"Awake, why &s;leepe&s;t thou O Lord? Ari&s;e, ca&s;t us not off forever. Wherefore hide&s;t thou thy face and forgette&s;t our affliction and our oppre&s;&s;ion? For our &s;oul is bowed down to the du&s;t; ari&s;e for our help, and redeem us for thy mercy's &s;ake. Thou ha&s;t &s;aved us from our enemies, and ha&s;t put them to &s;hame that hated us. We will not there|fore tru&s;t in our own bow, neither &s;hall our &s;word &s;ave us. But in thee we boa&s;t all the day long, and prai&s;e thy name forever."</P>
