</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT was &s;poken by the prophets to the an|cient people of God, is written for our u&s;e, that we, through the warnings of &s;cripture, might be moved with fear; and, through the comforts of &s;cripture, might have hope.</P>
<P>OUR relation to God, as a people redeemed by his hand and pre&s;erved by his care, as a people en|joying his oracles and profe&s;&s;ing obedience to his laws, is &s;o &s;imilar to <HI>theirs,</HI> that we may ju&s;tly ap|ply to our&s;elves what was here &s;poken to them. I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider my text in accommodati|on to our own ca&s;e: and &s;hall ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">I. That the land, in which we are placed, is a <HI>good</HI> land: and,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="020451_0004_0FAF0E9373BF73A8">II. That our <HI>enjoyment</HI> of the good of the land de|pends on our <HI>obedience</HI> to God.</P>
<P N="1">I. It may as truly be &s;aid of <HI>us,</HI> as of ancient <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> that God has given us a <HI>good land.</HI></P>
<P>WE lately thought it worth defending by our <HI>arms:</HI> it is &s;till worth &s;ecuring by our <HI>virtue.</HI></P>
<P>IT is an <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> land. Few empires on the globe are &s;o large, as the territory claimed by the&s;e &s;tates. It will admit a va&s;t increa&s;e of numbers; and probably di&s;tant generations will not find them|&s;elves &s;traitened for room.</P>
<P>IT is a <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> and <HI>fruitful</HI> land. As it lies in the mid&s;t of the temperate regions, no part of it is afflicted with intolerable heat, or rendered uninha|bitable by eternal fro&s;ts and &s;nows. With proper culture it yields us, not only the nece&s;&s;aries, but the delicacies of life, in &s;uch plenty and variety, that we need to be but little indebted to foreign trade.</P>
<P>GREATER <HI>indu&s;try</HI> may be nece&s;&s;ary here, than in &s;ome other climes: but this is no unfavourable cir|cum&s;tance; for indu&s;try contributes to health, vir|tue, freedom and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>WITH regard to <HI>commerce,</HI> nature has given us e|very advantage that can be wi&s;hed. We have an exten&s;ive coa&s;t, convenient harbours, navigable bays and rivers, materials of all kinds for &s;hipping, a rich and inexhau&s;tible fi&s;hery, and a variety of exporta|ble produce, which may be exchanged for the riches of other climes. Late experience &s;hews, that, we are in greater danger from the <HI>exce&s;s,</HI> than from the <HI>want</HI> of commerce. Moderate trade contributes to poli&s;h and enrich a people; but when it is carried beyond its proper limits, it produces contrary ef|fects, di&s;&s;ipation, poverty and vice.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="020451_0005_0FAF0E93AC350440">THIS is a <HI>healthful</HI> land. Tho&s;e direful pe&s;tilen|ces, which have ravaged other countries, are un|known here. A con&s;iderable proportion of the peo|ple live to old age; fewer die in infancy than in mo&s;t European nations: Our natural increa&s;e is &s;uppo|&s;ed to double our numbers as often as once in twen|ty five years.</P>
<P>IT is a land of <HI>liberty,</HI> and has been &s;o, with little interruption, from the days of our fathers.</P>
<P>THE royal charters fir&s;t granted to the American colonies, particularly to tho&s;e of New-England, were of the mo&s;t liberal kind, and fully agreeable to their views and wi&s;hes. No attempts hitherto made, to &s;ubvert our liberties, has been &s;ucce&s;sful. They will probably be pre&s;erved, until the people them&s;elves, &s;unk in vice and corruption, de&s;troy them with their own hands. How near we are to this fatal period, Heaven knows!</P>
<P>THE freedom of the&s;e colonies was fir&s;t invaded by James II, who, with a de&s;ign to e&s;tabli&s;h an ab|&s;olute monarchy, &s;eized their charters, together with tho&s;e of the corporations in England. But by the revolution which took place on the acce&s;&s;ion of the prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to the throne, the freedom both of Britain and America was re&s;tored and e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE late encroachments of the Briti&s;h court on our charter-rights awakened a ju&s;t and general con|cern. Though we were but an infant people, and our enemies were an ancient, rich and powerful na|tion, we ventured to re&s;i&s;t their claims; and, by a &s;eries of wonderful interpo&s;itions, our re&s;i&s;tance de|feated their de&s;igns and terminated in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of our independence.</P>
<P>WE are now under a government of <HI>our own</HI> fram|ing
<PB N="8" REF="020451_0006_0FAF0E9474ED2DD8">
and chu&s;ing. There is perhaps &s;carcely another in&s;tance of the kind on earth. It is a privilege, which few nations ever enjoy, and which the &s;ame nation probably can never enjoy more than <HI>once.</HI></P>
<P>MANY of the governments, now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the world, were e&s;tabli&s;hed by the conquering arms of a powerful invader; &s;ome were introduced by the u&s;urpation of princes; others have been fixed in con&s;equence of a civil war, in which one party pre|vailing has by arms given law to the re&s;t. Govern|ments, which owe their exi&s;tence to &s;uch a birth, mu&s;t, you know, in their very nature, be <HI>tyrannies.</HI> The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution was &s;ettled in a more liber|al manner, by an explicit compact between the king, the hereditary nobles and the repre&s;entatives of the people; and it is undoubtedly more favour|able to liberty, than mo&s;t other forms of government in Europe. But the con&s;titution of the&s;e &s;tates, and particularly of <HI>this,</HI> was framed and ratified in a manner &s;till more liberal. It is not, in any &s;en&s;e whatever, a compact between the rulers and the people; but it is a &s;olemn, explicit agreement of the people among them&s;elves. It was con&s;tructed by a convention of wi&s;e men, whom the people de|puted &s;olely for that purpo&s;e, and who, at that time, could have no &s;hare, and no appearance of a future &s;hare in the government they were framing. It was then remitted to the people at large, and competent time allowed for their deliberate examination and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and it was finally adopted and confirm|ed in con&s;equence of their <HI>general</HI> approbation. So happily was it adju&s;ted to the views of the people, at a time when the &s;pirit of liberty was at the height, that not a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> article was found in the <HI>whole,</HI> but
<PB N="9" REF="020451_0007_0FAF0E9574C58D50">
what met the approbation of more than <HI>two thirds</HI> of the inhabitants a&s;&s;embled in the &s;everal towns to give their voices upon it. It is therefore, in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e, THE CONSTISTUTION OF THE PEOPLE; and, in this view, it is more &s;acred than any form of government in Europe. Being framed by the people, it never ought to be changed, or al|tered without their <HI>general</HI> con&s;ent <HI>fairly</HI> a&s;ked, and <HI>freely</HI> given. There may undoubtedly be defects in it: nothing human is perfect: but &s;till it is <HI>our own;</HI> not impo&s;ed, but <HI>cho&s;en.</HI> And whatever imperfec|tions attend it, yet it is acknowledged, by all, to be formed on the highe&s;t principles, of liberty. The admini&s;tration of it is committed to men appointed by, and from among <HI>our&s;elves;</HI> to men who are fre|quently to return to <HI>private</HI> life; to men who are &s;ubject to the <HI>&s;ame laws</HI> and <HI>burthens,</HI> which they impo&s;e on their fellow citizens. The people have it in their power always to influence the mea&s;ures of government by <HI>petition</HI> and <HI>in&s;tructions,</HI> and often to change their rulers by <HI>new elections.</HI> Nations, who&s;e government is ab&s;olute, may be under the &s;ad ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to oppre&s;&s;ion, or of repelling it <HI>by force. This</HI> is a dreadful alternative, and u&s;ually terminates in the increa&s;e of the evil. We are un|d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity. Our government is &s;o con|&s;tituted, that publick oppre&s;&s;ions may be &s;oon re|moved without <HI>force,</HI> either by <HI>remon&s;trances</HI> again&s;t the mea&s;ures of rulers, or by a <HI>change</HI> of the rulers them&s;elves.</P>
<P>YOU will a&s;k, 'What if our new-cho&s;en rulers pur&s;ue the mea&s;ures of the former?' In this ca&s;e can|dour will lead us to &s;u&s;pect, that po&s;&s;ibly <HI>they</HI> may judge better than <HI>we.</HI> If their mea&s;ures meet with
<PB N="10" REF="020451_0008_0FAF0E95F724FD38">
<HI>general</HI> approbation, the <HI>few</HI> who are di&s;&s;atisfied mu&s;t &s;ubmit, until, by &s;peaking and publi&s;hing their &s;entiments, they can give general <HI>conviction.</HI> If we &s;hould ever be &s;o unhappy as to fall under <HI>&s;ucce&s;|&s;ion</HI> of wicked rulers, we mu&s;t cen&s;ure our <HI>ill choice.</HI> We have &s;till wi&s;e and good men among us If the time &s;hould come, when there is not a man to be found, who will execute judgment, and &s;eek the truth, how will God pardon us for this! Nothing, but immediate reformation, can prevent the fatal con&s;equences of &s;uch woful depravity. <HI>The&s;e</HI> fol|low by a <HI>divine</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hment, and it is not in the power of <HI>human</HI> government to guard again&s;t them.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it will be a&s;ked, 'Is there no ca&s;e in which a people may re&s;i&s;t government?' Yes, there is <HI>one</HI> &s;uch ca&s;e; and that is, when rulers <HI>u&s;urp</HI> a power <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive</HI> to the people, and continue to &s;up|port it by <HI>military force</HI> in contempt of every <HI>re&s;pect|ful remon&s;trance.</HI> In this ca&s;e the <HI>body</HI> of the people have a <HI>natural</HI> right to unite their &s;trength for the re&s;toration of <HI>their own con&s;titutional</HI> government. And, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, if a <HI>part</HI> of the people at|tempt by arms to controul or &s;ubvert the govern|ment, the rulers, who are the <HI>guardians</HI> of the con|&s;titution, have a right to call in the aid of the people to protect it. If the people may u&s;e force to &s;up|pre&s;s an armed <HI>u&s;urpation</HI> of uncon&s;titutional autho|rity, rulers may, on the &s;ame principle, u&s;e force to &s;uppre&s;s an armed <HI>in&s;urrection</HI> again&s;t con&s;titutional authority.</P>
<P>CIVIL liberty is a very valuable ble&s;&s;ing. It was the profe&s;&s;ed object of the late dangerous war. It is &s;ecured to us, as far as &s;ucce&s;s in the pro&s;ecution of the war, wi&s;dom in the &s;ettlement of the peace, and
<PB N="11" REF="020451_0009_0FAF0E987904A630">
deliberation in framing our government, <HI>could</HI> &s;e|cure it. Our own virtue and prudence, under pro|vidence, mu&s;t do the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS is a land; not only of civil, but <HI>religious</HI> li|berty. The enjoyment of go&s;pel-privileges was a grand motive with our ance&s;tors to enterpri&s;e on emigration to this di&s;tant world. They brought with them the &s;acred &s;criptures, early formed church|es for divine wor&s;hip, diligently in&s;tructed their chil|dren in the knowledge of religion, erected private &s;chools for their education, and, as &s;oon as the a|bilities of the country would permit, they e&s;tabli&s;hed larger &s;eminaries, in which youth might be trained up for publick employments, e&s;pecially for the mi|ni&s;try, that this important office might not become u&s;ele&s;s and contemptible by falling into the hands of illiterate men. Care was taken to &s;ecure to the churches the privilege of chu&s;ing their own teachers, and of wor&s;hipping God according to the dictates of their own con&s;ciences; a privilege which the&s;e churches now po&s;&s;e&s;s in the ample&s;t manner, and which is happily confirmed by the civil government under which we are placed. In con&s;equence of the pious zeal of our fathers, we &s;till, through the divine goodne&s;s, enjoy the go&s;pel of the Redeemer, and the offers and means of eternal &s;alvation. The word of God is di&s;pen&s;ed, his ordinances admini&s;tred, his &s;abbaths continued, churches are maintained and religious wor&s;hip pre&s;erved in them, and, we have rea&s;on to hope, that the gracious influences of the divine &s;pirit, are not wholly withdrawn, but are &s;till vouch&s;afed to render the go&s;pel &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>IS any thing now wanting to make this a <HI>good land?</HI> &mdash;Nothing but our own virtue and wi&s;dom in the improvement of the&s;e advantages.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="020451_0010_0FAF0E99796CD9F8">THIS thought naturally introduces our other ob|&s;ervation,</P>
<P N="2">II. That our <HI>enjoyment</HI> of the <HI>good</HI> of this land de|pends on our <HI>obedience</HI> to God.</P>
<P><HI>External</HI> advantages, without wi&s;dom and virtue to apply them, will make neither a people, nor a per&s;on happy. A man, &s;urrounded with all the means of wealth, will be indigent, if he knows not how to u&s;e them. One po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the ample&s;t for|tune, without a capacity to enjoy it, will &s;uffer all the mi&s;eries of real poverty. The be&s;t natural con|&s;titution of body will &s;oon be ruined by exce&s;&s;ive indulgence. So a people, ble&s;t with all imaginable circum&s;tances of national felicity, may be en&s;laved, and even de&s;troyed by their own vices and follies.</P>
<P>There is a connection between virtue and happi|ne&s;s; between vice and wretchedne&s;s, in &s;ocial as well as private life. From the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of the &s;upreme Governour, we may naturally con|clude, that he will protect and pro&s;per a virtuous people, while he leaves corrupt and irreclaimable nations to &s;uffer the fatal effects of their own per|ver&s;ene&s;s. This natural conclu&s;ion from the divine character is confirmed by the declarations of &s;crip|ture, and the u&s;ual cour&s;e of providence. The threatning and the promi&s;e in our text are mo&s;t ex|plicit and peremptory; and to give them the great|er &s;olemnity, it is added, <HI>The mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken them.</HI></P>
<P>IT will be proper for us particularly to con&s;ider, what tho&s;e virtues are, on which our national hap|pine&s;s principally depends.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t thing that here meets our thoughts is <HI>internal peace</HI> and <HI>union.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="020451_0011_0FAF0E9A934457B0">CAN a man be happy, who&s;e brea&s;t is the &s;eat of contending pa&s;&s;ions? Can a family pro&s;per, who a members continually oppo&s;e and counteract each o|ther? Can the harve&s;ts of your fields &s;tand &s;ecure a|mid&s;t a war of conflicting elements?&mdash;No more can a nation flouri&s;h, while it is di&s;tracted with inte&s;tine broils. 'Every kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf is bro't to de&s;olation.' A &s;mall people united will be &s;trong and re&s;pectable: the large&s;t community broken and disjointed becomes impotent and contemptible. It was our union in the late war, that gave us &s;trength to bear up again&s;t the power of a &s;uperiour enemy. Had we been divided, we mu&s;t have fallen. The union, which was nece&s;&s;ary to an effectual defence, is &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to our enjoying the good of the land.</P>
<P>IT is not uncommon, that when the burthens ari|&s;ing from a long war pre&s;s hard on a people, and the terrour of the invading enemy, which for a while animated and united them, is intirely remov|ed, they lo&s;e their patriotick zeal, and fall into dan|gerous contentions. This is an event which our enemies predicted for us; which our friends fore|warned us of, and which, to our di&s;grace, we now begin to realize.</P>
<P>WHATEVER oppre&s;&s;ions we &s;uffer, or &s;eem to &s;uf|fer, our mea&s;ures of redre&s;s mu&s;t be only &s;uch, as may con&s;i&s;t with our internal peace; for being di|vided again&s;t our&s;elves, we &s;hall become an ea&s;y prey to foreign invaders; or rather, &s;hall fall a con|temptible prey to one another. Contentions, once begun, may proceed to, we know not what, dreadful lengths; and may terminate in, we know not what, direful events. While, with a watchful eye we guard again&s;t every <HI>real</HI> inva&s;ion of our rights, we
<PB N="14" REF="020451_0012_0FAF0E9B382E5AD0">
mu&s;t place a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> confidence in our rulers, and &s;tudy and pur&s;ue the things which contribute to peace, both in our &s;maller &s;ocieties, and in the com|munity at large.</P>
<P>A general di&s;tru&s;t is incon&s;i&s;tent with government and &s;ubver&s;ive of all &s;ecurity. Confidence joined with circum&s;pection tends both to peace and liber|ty. Let not Ephraim envy Judah, nor Judah vex Ephraim, and their common adver&s;aries will be re|moved.</P>
<P N="2">2. In order to our enjoying the good of the land, there mu&s;t be mutual <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>benevolence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary to internal peace, and branches of the obedience recommended in the text. <HI>Seek judgment, relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, plead for the widow.</HI></P>
<P>OUR fir&s;t obligation to mankind is <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> This is rendering to all their dues, in oppo&s;ition to every kind of fraud, oppre&s;&s;ion and violence. The great law, which ought to govern our &s;ocial conduct, is <HI>to do to others, as we would, that they &s;hould do to us; to owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</HI> This law, written in the heart, will prompt us to the <HI>vo|luntary</HI> exerci&s;e of equity, integrity and righteou&s;|ne&s;s. It is the want of <HI>this,</HI> that makes the <HI>coercion</HI> of <HI>human</HI> government &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of &s;ociety. 'The law is made for the lawle&s;s.' Every man can ea&s;ily judge of him&s;elf what is right, by a&s;king his own heart, what, in a &s;imilar ca&s;e, he would expect from another.</P>
<P>OUR next obligation is <HI>goodne&s;s.</HI> The poor we have always with us: and there are times when their number is increa&s;ed. The late war, as might na|turally be expected, has made a con&s;iderable change of property. It has reduced many to ab&s;olute po|verty,
<PB N="15" REF="020451_0013_0FAF0E9BF127F048">
and others to an incapacity of &s;u&s;taining any great &s;hare of the common burthen without leaving their families to want. Government, at &s;uch a time, ought to adju&s;t their demands to the common abil|ity; and this, we hope, is their <HI>aim,</HI> for <HI>they</HI> bear a part of the burthen with others. But it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the <HI>general</HI> rules, by which the mea&s;ures of government <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be directed, will often operate with <HI>&s;ome inequality.</HI> This is an <HI>unavoidable</HI> imperfection of human &s;ociety. In &s;uch ca&s;es, in|&s;tead of charging government with cruelty, it would be proper for the more &s;trong to a&s;&s;i&s;t the weak. <HI>Bear ye one another's burthens,</HI> &s;ays the law of Chri&s;t. The law of rea&s;on &s;ays the &s;ame.</P>
<P>NO community ought to leave her prudent and indu&s;trious members to &s;truggle in vain under an in&s;upportable load. By mutual &s;uccour in times of di&s;tre&s;s we increa&s;e the common &s;trength. Recip|rocal &s;upport and protection is one end of &s;ociety. 'Two are better than one, for if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but wo to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up. And if one prevail again&s;t him, two &s;hall with|&s;tand him, and a threefold cord is not quickly brok|en.'</P>
<P>A community, in which an oppo&s;ite &s;pirit prevails, cannot be happy. Mutual fraud, inju&s;tice and op|pre&s;&s;ion cau&s;e perpetual animo&s;ities, and frequent litigations, di&s;courage indu&s;try and enterprize, de&s;|troy all confidence, and ob&s;truct every mea&s;ure pro|po&s;ed for the common good.</P>
<P N="3">3. The happine&s;s of a people farther depends on <HI>indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>frugality.</HI></P>

idlene&s;s and profu&s;ene&s;s. If it would, it mu&s;t &s;oon cea&s;e to be a good land. In a country, where every man could grow rich with little labour, almo&s;t every man would in fact be poor; for there being no &s;pur to indu&s;try and few examples of it, the body of the people would &s;ink into idlene&s;s, luxury and wretched|ne&s;s. All the wealth, and all the power would be engro&s;&s;ed by the provident and enterprizing few. The re&s;t would be &s;laves, or little &s;uperiour.</P>
<P>AT a time like this, when the expen&s;es, incurred by the late conte&s;t for independence, are lying as a burthen on the country, diligence in our callings, and prudence in our manner of living, are of pecu|liar importance. While the object of the war ap|peared precarious, we thought no &s;acrifice too great to obtain it. Since we have obtained it, let us &s;ub|mit to &s;ome &s;elf-denial, that we may &s;ecure it. Tho' our burthens are heavy, yet we may hope, that by tho&s;e &s;miles of heaven, which will always attend a virtuous people, we &s;hall &s;oon, in a way of prudence and indu&s;try, find relief: without <HI>the&s;e,</HI> miracles could not make us happy. Idlene&s;s and luxury brings on poverty; <HI>this</HI> multiplies the temptations to inju&s;tice; inju&s;tice breeds contention, and this makes confu&s;ion and every evil work.</P>
<P N="4">4. Our enjoyment of the good of the land will de|pend on the <HI>regular admini&s;tration</HI> of, and a <HI>peacea|ble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> to civil government.</P>
<P>MANKIND cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ociety, nor &s;o|ciety without government. If there was no way to controul the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, check the pa&s;&s;ions and re&s;|train the vices of men, they would &s;oon become in|tolerable to each other. Government is the com|bination of the whole community again&s;t the vices
<PB N="17" REF="020451_0015_0FAF0E9F30A191D8">
of each member. The de&s;ign of it is not meerly to provide for general defence again&s;t <HI>foreign</HI> power, but to exerci&s;e a controul over every individual, to re&s;train him from wrong, and compel him to right, &s;o far as the common &s;afety requires. The be&s;t form of government will not make a people happy, without a <HI>ju&s;t admini&s;tration</HI> of it, and <HI>cheerful obe|dience</HI> to it; and both the&s;e very much depend on the virtue of the people. We mu&s;t commit the ad|mini&s;tration of our government to our wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men: not to tho&s;e, whom we would not dare to tru&s;t in our private affairs; but to tho&s;e, who&s;e known ability and integrity intitle them to our confidence; for 'he that is faithful in the lea&s;t, is faithful al&s;o in much; and he that is unju&s;t in the lea&s;t, in un|ju&s;t al&s;o in much.'</P>
<P>WILL you think a man capable of being a <HI>patriot</HI> whom you &s;ee to be di&s;hone&s;t, unfaithful, di&s;&s;olute, and profane? You may as well judge him a <HI>&s;aint.</HI> As well may your <HI>charity</HI> &s;end him to heaven, as your <HI>prudence</HI> prefer him to be a leader in the affairs of &s;tate. We mu&s;t al&s;o contribute our aid to car|ry into effect the <HI>good</HI> laws of the &s;tate, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which relate to virtue and morals. If we di&s;|cover errours, we mu&s;t endeavour to rectify them; but let us not, under pretence of redre&s;&s;ing wrongs, de&s;troy what is right; nor in our zeal to amend the &s;tate, forget to amend our&s;elves. The more virtue there is among the people, the more there will be a|mong rulers, becau&s;e better men will be elected to power; and they, who are elected, will be more &s;trongly influenced to a right u&s;e of their power. If we indulge in our&s;elves the faults that we condemn
<PB N="18" REF="020451_0016_0FAF0EA07193B238">
in rulers; if, while we complain of publick oppre&s;|&s;ion or profu&s;ene&s;s, we are prodigal in our expen&s;es, or unju&s;t to our neighbours, we are gro&s;sly incon|&s;i&s;tent. We &s;hew, how government <HI>would</HI> be ad|mini&s;tred, if it was committed to <HI>our</HI> hands.</P>
<P>ZEALOUS for a good government, let us be zea|lous of good works, maintain them our&s;elves, en|courage them among others, and, as far as our in|fluence extends, give efficacy to whole&s;ome laws, that they may be a terrour to evil doers and a pro|tection to them who do well.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another thing nece&s;&s;ary to our national happi|ne&s;s is <HI>a diligent attendance on the in&s;tituted means of religion.</HI></P>
<P>THE go&s;pel inculcates tho&s;e virtues, which imme|diately conduce to publick felicity, &s;uch as peace, ju&s;tice, charity, indu&s;try and temperance; and there|fore our attendance on its in&s;titutions, which are de&s;igned for the promotion of the&s;e virtues, is a prin|cipal mean of national pro&s;perity. The ob&s;ervance of &s;abbaths and of &s;ocial wor&s;hip is, in this view, of va&s;t importance to &s;ociety, and of &s;till higher im|portance to each individual in regard to his future &s;alvation. It much concerns us therefore as mem|bers of civil &s;ociety, and more as chri&s;tians, to main|tain the publick di&s;pen&s;ation of God's word and ordinances, to attend on it our&s;elves and encourage the attendance of others, and to be likeminded one toward another, that we may with one mind and one mouth glorify God.</P>
<P N="6">6. As we wi&s;h to tran&s;mit to our children the <HI>good|ne&s;s</HI> of our land, we mu&s;t train them up in &s;uch a manner, that they may be <HI>capable</HI> of enjoying it.</P>
<P>WE have generally profe&s;&s;ed, that the happine&s;s
<PB N="19" REF="020451_0017_0FAF0EA132E79DC0">
of <HI>po&s;terity,</HI> rather than our own, was our object in the late war. This was our <HI>language,</HI> 'The pre|&s;ent generation will &s;uffer much in the conflict; but we cannot be reconciled to the pro&s;pect of leaving our children &s;laves. <HI>We</HI> &s;uffer to purcha&s;e freedom for <HI>them?</HI> The war has ended as &s;ucce&s;sfully as we wi&s;hed, and we have &s;uffered no more than we pro|fe&s;&s;ed to exert. If the good of po&s;terity was our aim, let us not lo&s;e &s;ight of it now. Let us educate them in knowledge and virtue, and teach them to be will|ing and obedient, that they may eat the good of the land. What benefit will all our labours and &s;uffer|ings in the cau&s;e of <HI>liberty</HI> tran&s;mit to them, if we leave them to grow up &s;laves to their own lu&s;ts and to the evil manners of the world, and thus to bring down on them&s;elves the fatal judgments of an an|gry Deity?</P>
<P>POLITICAL liberty depends on national virtue. Prevailing vice &s;ooner or later introduces national &s;lavery. Under almo&s;t any form of government a virtuous people will be free and happy. But a peo|ple &s;unk in corruption mu&s;t be wretched. Their go|vernment, however liberal in its principles, will be fevere in its admini&s;tration, becau&s;e they can &s;ub|&s;i&s;t under no other. If we would convey to our chil|dren the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible freedom, we mu&s;t train them up in virtuous &s;entiments and manners.</P>
<P>HAVING illu&s;trated the ob&s;ervations contained in the text, let us now &s;eriou&s;ly apply them.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee what obligations we are under to God for his goodne&s;s to our nation; and how we may enjoy the continuance of his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>HE has placed us in a land of health, plenty, free|dom and go&s;pel light; defended us in the enjoy|ment
<PB N="20" REF="020451_0018_0FAF0EA1EFA26988">
of our privileges; pro&s;pered us in a dangerous war; granted the &s;weet return of peace; allowed us the independence which we &s;ought; &s;ettled us under a government of our own chu&s;ing; given us abundance of health; made the &s;ea&s;ons peculiarly favourable for &s;everal years, and e&s;pecially in the year pa&s;t, and &s;miled on all the labours of our hands.</P>
<P>IT becomes us, under a thoughtful &s;en&s;e of his great goodne&s;s, to prai&s;e and exalt his name, and to re&s;olve that our future conduct &s;hall be corre&s;pon|dent with our pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude. 'They who offer prai&s;e glorify God, and to them who or|der their conver&s;ation aright, 'he will &s;hew his &s;al|vation.'</P>
<P>LET us, as becomes a people profe&s;&s;ing their de|pendence on God, deeply humble our&s;elves for our &s;ins. One principal de&s;ign of his goodne&s;s is, to lead us to repentance.</P>
<P>LET the re&s;toration of peace, after a bloody and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war, influence us to peace and union a|mong our&s;elves. How provoking, in the &s;ight of the God of peace, would be inte&s;tine divi&s;ions and animo&s;ities, after &s;uch recent experience of the cala|mities of war, and of the divine goodne&s;s in our de|liverance! Would he not be angry with us, till he had con&s;umed us?</P>
<P>LET the bounty of our divine Benefactor, in &s;up|plying our various wants, excite us to do good to the needy. The be&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of gratitude to God, is an imitation of his beneficence. We are to offer the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e continually, and e&s;pecially to do good and communicate, for with &s;uch &s;acrifices he is be&s;t plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="020451_0019_0FAF0EA2E2D47548">LET us u&s;e the bounties of his providence with temperance and moderation. This is a moral duty at all times; it is a political duty at &s;uch a time as this. As chri&s;tians we are required to be temper|ate in all things, and with quietne&s;s to work the thing that is good, that we may eat our own bread, and have to give to tho&s;e who need. As members of &s;ociety we are now under additional obligations to indu&s;try and &s;obriety, that we may relieve our|&s;elves and our country from the peculiar burthens of the day, and may enjoy the good of the land.</P>
<P>LET us remember our obligations to God for con|tinuing to us his glorious go&s;pel, and pray for its ge|neral &s;ucce&s;s, and for a divine power to accompany it in our own &s;ouls.</P>
<P>LET us attend on the in&s;tituted wor&s;hip of God, cultivate peace in the religious &s;ocieties of which we are members, and avoid all &s;uch divi&s;ions as tend to ob&s;truct the influence of the go&s;pel and to defeat the end for which churches are formed.</P>
<P>LET us bring up our children in the knowledge, and inculcate on them the duties of religion, teach|ing them to deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and piou&s;ly in the world, and thus to look for the ble&s;&s;ed hope which the go&s;|pel &s;ets before them.</P>
<P>WORLDLY pro&s;perity, however de&s;ireable, is not an object of the fir&s;t importance. We are &s;oon to quit this mortal &s;tate; let us be chiefly &s;olicitous to &s;ecure a title to a better country.</P>
<P>WE have here no continuing city. In a few days we &s;hall make our final remove, and another &s;et of mortals will &s;ucceed in our places. Every year makes con&s;iderable changes; a few years produce va&s;t al|terations
<PB N="22" REF="020451_0020_0FAF0EA5D9CD0E88">
in the inhabitants of this dying world. Though the pa&s;t year has been generally healthful, yet the number of deaths in this &s;ociety has been greater than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>GOD's providence utters a warning voice to people of every age.</P>
<P>CHILDREN and youths are &s;olemnly warned of their mortality, and urged to give an immediate at|tention to their everla&s;ting concerns. Let this day, be with you, my children, not a day of thoughtle&s;s levity, wanton mirth and wild di&s;&s;ipation; but a day of &s;erious recollection, fervent prayer, and humble dedication of your&s;elves to God. While you prai&s;e him for his goodne&s;s in pre&s;erving you another year, repent of the &s;ins and follies of the year pa&s;t, con|&s;ecrate your &s;pared lives to his &s;ervice and enter on a &s;peedy preparation for the changes, that may await you in the year to come.</P>
<P>HEADS of families, and per&s;ons in the mid&s;t of life, are taught the uncertainty of their continuance here. While the death of a neighbour and friend awakens in our minds a grateful remembrance of God's &s;par|ing mercy to us and our families, let it al&s;o impre&s;s us with a &s;en&s;e of the changes to which we are ex|po&s;ed, and excite a &s;erious concern to maintain re|ligion in our hearts, and promote it in our hou&s;es.</P>
<P>THE <HI>aged</HI> have been repeatedly warned. My fa|thers, a greater number of your cotemporaries have been removed in the year pa&s;t, than has been com|mon in preceding years. God's voice to you is, <HI>Be ye al&s;o ready.</HI> You &s;tand on the borders of the eternal world. Soon you mu&s;t go the way, whence you will not return. Within the en&s;uing year, it is probable, &s;ome of your &s;mall number will make
<PB N="23" REF="020451_0021_0FAF0EA6F00EBC00">
their la&s;t remove. You ought to examine your &s;tate, to be in&s;tant in prayer, to live in the daily ex|erci&s;e of faith and piety, and by a holy and blame|le&s;s example recommend religion to tho&s;e who are coming after you. May you, and may we all, when the time of our departure is come, be able to rejoice in the reflection, that we have fini&s;hed our cour&s;e well, and in the hope that there is laid up for us a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS, though on many accounts a day of rejoice|ing, is, in other re&s;pects, a day of danger and dark|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE general indifference to the in&s;tituted ordi|nances of the go&s;pel, threatens the di&s;continuance of them; the prevalence of wickedne&s;s forbodes divine judgments; and our civil commotions and di&s;tur|bances give cau&s;e to apprehend a troublous &s;cene approaching. Should they &s;pread and prevail &s;o far as to involve the &s;tate in a civil war, what have we to expect as the con&s;equences, but general poverty, bondage and wretchedne&s;s?</P>
<P>THAT the people are under great burthens, all are agreed. Whether there are <HI>grievances,</HI> I leave with others to determine. Admitting there are, undoubt|edly there may be methods of redre&s;s more &s;afe, and more effectual than <HI>arms.</HI> If any of you have thought this a nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure, I only a&s;k, that you would calmly review what I have &s;aid on the nature of our government, and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider what may be the con&s;equences of drawing the &s;word; and po&s;|&s;ibly you will &s;ee rea&s;on to alter your &s;entiments.</P>
<P>I have &s;poken with freedom, becau&s;e I am anxious for my country; and without fear of offending, be|cau&s;e I know the candour of my audience.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="020451_0022_0FAF0EA72C4B91B0">LET us all be &s;olicitous to prove what is acceptable with God. Let us &s;tudy the wi&s;dom which is pure and peaceable, full of mercy and good fruits. Let us humbly implore the interpo&s;ition of that being, who has all events, and all hearts in his hand, to a|vert the evils that threaten us, to awaken our drow|&s;y hearts to a &s;en&s;e of the importance of religion, to lead us to repentance and amendment of life, to pre|pare us for his mercies and make us a happy people.</P>
