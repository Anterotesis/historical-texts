<HEAD>TO JOHN ADAMS, L.L.D. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH I am aware, that by electing for my humble productions a patron|age &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, I hazard the accu&s;ation of pre&s;umption, I re&s;t confident that your candour will a&s;cribe my temerity to the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible motive.</P>
<P>THAT benignity and dignified affability, which is perhaps in&s;eparable from a truly no|ble mind, may be compared to the lucid veil, that, thrown around the orient beam, accom|modates to our imbecile gaze tho&s;e &s;plendors, which might otherwi&s;e dazzle and confound; we trace with enkindling ardor the mildly at|tempered radiance, we learn to appreciate its worth, and &s;pontaneou&s;ly we ble&s;s its genial path.</P>
<P>To dwell with accumulating energy upon the plea&s;ing pa&s;t, is one of the appropriate felicities of rea&s;on; and, amid the review of other times, retro&s;pection frequently pre&s;ents to my mental eye, a period which memory piou&s;ly con&s;e|crates, when, privileged by an opportunity of
<PB N="iv" REF="034162_0003_0FFC5DA10E47DE58">
contemplating the Pre&s;ident, during the white moments of &s;ocial plea&s;ure, the dome&s;tic vir|tues collected and embodied, were exemplified with uncommon lu&s;tre; and while the recol|lection of his philanthropic manners, and uni|form elevation, gives me to mark with addi|tional complacency, the a&s;cendency he hath &s;o meritoriou&s;ly obtained in the public mind, I re|gard the authority to in&s;cribe the&s;e volumes to him among the mo&s;t elating circum&s;tances of my life.</P>
<P>WERE I to indulge the genuine language of my heart, it would be a ta&s;k of no ordinary de|&s;cription, to circum&s;cribe within due bounds tho&s;e expan&s;ive effu&s;ions re&s;ulting from admi|ration of his character, and from affectionate gratitude for the very e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices he hath rendered to a country, that may con&s;ider his birth as an era in her annals, and that ju&s;tly places this event among her highe&s;t honours.</P>
<P>THE homage we yield to eminent abilities, and luminous rectitude, can never involve the charge of &s;ingularity; for genius, elevated by virtue and unimpeached integrity, adorned by literature, elegance and ta&s;te, have in all ages commanded the e&s;teem and veneration of man|kind: but although I might plead the &s;anction of numerous and re&s;pectable examples, I can|not,
<PB N="v" REF="034162_0004_0FFC5D9F8B13EC18">
however, di&s;cern the utility of e&s;&s;aying to prove, that the maje&s;ty of day illumines our world, or that his &s;alutary influence, like &s;ome gladdening deity, diffu&s;es over the face of na|ture, con&s;i&s;tency, harmony, and unrivalled beauty.</P>
<P>THAT America has looked up to you, Sir, as her &s;econd hope, is a truth which carries in its bo&s;om a panegyric upon your virtues more im|pre&s;&s;ive, than if an angel had pronounced your eulogy; and while our fervid benedictions mu&s;t ever follow the retiring Chief, who&s;e guardian care conducted our benighted foot&s;teps over paths untried and perilous, to a brilliant morn|ing, the refulgent dawn of which is regarded as the harbinger of a glorious meridian, we hail with ardent expectancy his patriotic &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, who, like another Eli&s;ha, clothed in the &s;acred ve&s;tments of authority, inherits a full proportion of that &s;pirit, which re&s;ted upon him, who, emancipating his country from un|warrantable u&s;urpations, will ever be recog|ni&s;ed as her DELIVERER: Thus, in the &s;ame moment that to the name of Wa&s;hington, re|&s;pectful gratitude, bending over the unperi&s;h|ing record of his illu&s;trious acts, e&s;tabli&s;hes in the Columbian bo&s;om her eternal monuments; we exult in an ADAMS, who&s;e tran&s;cendent tal|ents,
<PB N="vi" REF="034162_0005_0FFC5D9A396469D0">
and who&s;e vigilance, are fully adequate to the emergencies and the dangers of a FREE GOVERNMENT; who&s;e wi&s;dom and magnanim|ity will firmly guide the helm of State; who, although contending &s;torms may a&s;&s;ail, and the big waves of oppo&s;ition may la&s;h the bark, will pur&s;ue with unwavering intrepidity, his de&s;tin|ed way; while rectitude his chart, and expe|rience his compa&s;s, he mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly make the broad and ample harbour of Security.</P>
<P>YES, Sir, I indulge a hope that your name may not only &s;hield me from the oblivion I dread, but po&s;&s;ibly confer a degree of celebri|ty, to which my own merit may not furni&s;h a title; yet whatever is the fate of preten&s;ions originating perhaps in arrogance, may you, Sir, pur&s;ue your cour&s;e with ever new effulgence. The guardian of a nation's weal, you will watch over us for good. May you long continue to direct, enliven, and invigorate; and may your parting moments &s;et &s;erenely bright.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>MY Readers will not call my veracity in que&s;tion, when I a&s;&s;ure them that I am ardently anxious for their approbation. A lover of hu|manity, I do not remember the period when I was not &s;olicitous to render my&s;elf acceptable to all tho&s;e who were naturally or adventitiou&s;ly my a&s;&s;ociates. Had I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ability, I &s;hould have advanced every individual of my &s;pecies to the highe&s;t &s;tate of felicity, of which the pre&s;ent &s;cene is &s;u&s;ceptible; but circum&s;cribed within very nar|row bounds, I have, I had almo&s;t &s;aid momently, been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of lamenting the in|efficacy of my wi&s;hes. Yet this my <HI>ruling pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> a fondne&s;s to &s;tand well in the opinion of the world, having given a prevalent hue to every im|portant action of my life, hath operated powerfully upon my ambition, &s;timulated my efforts, and im|planted in my bo&s;om an invincible de&s;ire to pre|&s;ent my&s;elf before a public which I reverence, ir|re&s;i&s;tibly impelling me to become a candidate for that complacency we naturally feel toward tho&s;e per&s;ons, or that performance, which hath contrib|uted to our emolument, or even amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>MY de&s;ires are, I am free to own, a&s;piring&mdash;perhaps pre&s;umptuou&s;ly &s;o. I would be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="viii" REF="034162_0007_0FFC5D92D6492F58">
and re&s;pected by my contemporaries; I would be continued in grateful remembrance when I make my exit; and I would de&s;cend with celeb|rity to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>HAD I been mi&s;tre&s;s of talents for an achievement &s;o meritorious, my fir&s;t object in writing would have been the information and improvement of my readers; nor will I deny that a plea&s;ing hope plays about my heart, &s;ugge&s;ting a po&s;&s;ibility of my becoming in &s;ome &s;mall degree beneficial to tho&s;e young people, who, ju&s;t entering the career of life, may turn, with all the endearing ardour of youth|ful enthu&s;ia&s;m, to a <HI>New Book,</HI> to an <HI>American Au|thor;</HI> and while with partial avidity they pur&s;ue the <HI>well intended</HI> pages, they may &s;elect a hint, or trea&s;ure up a remark, which may become u&s;eful in the de&s;tined journey of life.</P>
<P>BUT vanity, in the mo&s;t extravagant moments of her triumph, having never flattered me with the capability of conveying in&s;truction to tho&s;e, who&s;e under&s;tandings have pa&s;&s;ed the age of adole&s;cence, my view has only been to <HI>amu&s;e;</HI> and if I can do this without offending, I &s;hall be honoured with a place in &s;ome gentle bo&s;om where I &s;hould el&s;e have been unknown; I &s;hall obtain a portion of e&s;teem, and my <HI>ruling pa&s;&s;ion</HI> will be thus far gratified.</P>
<P>To have pre&s;ented a fini&s;hed or perfect produc|tion, (&s;uch is my fondne&s;s for literary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame) I would gladly have relinqui&s;hed my <HI>pre&s;ent mode of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, more&mdash;I would have laboured for the comple|tion
<PB N="ix" REF="034162_0008_0FFC5D914EB9B6E0">
of &s;uch a compo&s;ition through a long &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of lengthening years, although my life had been a &s;cene of <HI>penury</HI> and <HI>hard&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>WITH &s;uch &s;entiments I &s;hall not be &s;u&s;pected of writing ha&s;tily or carele&s;sly. The truth is, I have penned every e&s;&s;ay as cautiou&s;ly as if I had been a&s;&s;ured my reputation re&s;ted &s;olely upon that &s;ingle effort: yet defects of almo&s;t every de|&s;cription may too probably occur; the Gramma|rian, the Rhetorician, the Poet, the&s;e may all trace &s;uch palpable deviations from the given &s;tandard, as may render me, in their opinion, an unpardona|ble offender again&s;t the rules of language, and the elegance and graces of &s;tyle. Po&s;&s;ibly too, thus laid open to all the &s;everity of critici&s;m, I may be arraigned, tried and condemned; and in this ca&s;e it is certainly true, that I am preparing for my&s;elf the &s;evere&s;t pangs. But, be this as it may, I re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the feelings of the Morali&s;t being in no in&s;tance wounded, he will accept with complacency my efforts in the common cau&s;e, and humanely &s;hield me from tho&s;e &s;hafts which might otherwi&s;e transfix my peace.</P>
<P>HAVING, in the concluding E&s;&s;ay, given my rea&s;ons for a&s;&s;uming the ma&s;culine character, I have only further to ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e who ad|mit the utility of conveying in&s;truction and amu&s;e|ment by allegory or metaphor, and who allow the propriety of giving a tongue to the inanimate world, and &s;peech to the inferior orders of the creation, will not object to the liberty I have taken. It is
<PB N="x" REF="034162_0009_0FFC5D8FC8FE3F00">
&s;uperfluous to add, that allegory and fable are not only authorized by the be&s;t moral writers, but are al&s;o &s;anctioned by holy writ.</P>
<P>I CANNOT urge in defence of my temerity, that the importunity of friends hath drawn me forth&mdash;certainly not. But, worthy reader, I repeat that I have been animated, in this my arduous pur&s;uit, <HI>by a de&s;ire to be introduced to thee, by a wi&s;h to make one in the number of thy friends. I am &s;olicitous to ob|tain an e&s;tabli&s;hment in the bo&s;om of virtue</HI>&mdash;I would advance my claim to the &s;weetly &s;oothing &s;trains of ju&s;t applau&s;e; and I would &s;ecure for my&s;elf, and for my infant daughter, (&s;hould our future exi|gencies require it) thy amity and thy patronage.</P>
<P>IF thou proceede&s;t through the volumes before thee, we &s;hall pa&s;s on together through many a page; the &s;entiments of my heart will be unre&s;erv|edly pourtrayed; and I fondly per&s;uade my&s;elf that thou wilt, without reluctance, embrace in the arms of thy complacency, thy mo&s;t obedient, and &s;incerely devoted friend, and very humble &s;ervant,</P>

<P>OBSERVING in the general preface, publi&s;hed in the <HI>December</HI> Magazine,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader is reque&s;ted to remember, that the E&s;&s;ays which compo&s;e this Fir&s;t Volume were written purpo&s;ely for the Monthly Mu&s;eum, in which they originally appeared; and that they now &s;tand precisely in the order, and nearly in the manner, in which they were fir&s;t pre&s;ented.</NOTE> a hint which I have con&s;trued into a de&s;ire to increa&s;e the number of your mi&s;cellaneous corre&s;pondents; and, &s;timulated by the delicate reproof upon literary indolence, which that elegant exordium contains, I feel my&s;elf, while &s;itting quite at my lei&s;ure, on this evening of January 27th, 1792, &s;trongly incited by my <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad genius&mdash;the event</HI> mu&s;t determine the character of the &s;pright which is goading me on, to take into my &s;erious con&s;ideration, the &s;olicitation which in &s;aid preface is &s;o mode&s;tly urged, and which &s;quares &s;o wonderfully well with my ideas of the rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of things.</P>
<P>Not that I &s;hall aim at palming my&s;elf upon the pub|lic, for a &s;on of literature, a votary of the nine, or a dabbler in wit. I have no preten&s;ion to any of the&s;e characters. I am <HI>rather</HI> a plain man, who, after &s;pend|ing the day in making provi&s;ion for my little family, &s;it my&s;elf comfortably down by a clean hearth, and a good fire, enjoying, through the&s;e long evenings, with an ex|qui&s;ite
<PB N="14" REF="034162_0013_0FFC5D8529C36FD0">
ze&s;t, the plea&s;ures of the hour, whether they happen to be furni&s;hed by an amu&s;ing tale, a well written book, or a &s;ocial friend. Po&s;&s;ibly I might have jogged on to the end of my journey, in this &s;ober, tranquil manner: but alas, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, I think, as near as I can remember, ever &s;ince the commencement of your Magazine, I have been &s;eized with a violent de&s;ire to become a writer. To combat this unaccountable itch for &s;cribbling, it is in vain that I have endeavoured; it follows me through all the bu&s;y &s;cenes which the day pre&s;ents; it is my con&s;tant accompaniment in every nocturnal haunt; and it often keeps me waking, when, I verily believe, but for this re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire, I might enjoy, in the fulle&s;t latitude, every ble&s;&s;ing which hath ever yet been a&s;cribed to &s;leep.</P>
<P>The many comprehen&s;ive titles, and alluring &s;ig|natures, which have from time to time embelli&s;hed your Magazine, have well near captivated my rea&s;on; and among many <HI>et ceteras,</HI> which might be enumer|ated, the following appellations have had for me pe|culiar charms: An ample field &s;eemed opening in the title page of the <HI>General Ob&s;erver;</HI> the name <HI>Philo</HI> appeared replete with &s;tudious lore; the <HI>Politician</HI> was indefatigable for the good of the nation; the <HI>Philanthropi&s;t</HI> bled &s;ympathy; and with the <HI>Rivulet</HI> I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">raptured. At the bar of fancy, many a title for my intended e&s;&s;ays hath been tried, and hath been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively condemned. A variety of &s;ignatures have been deliberately adopted, and as deliberately di&s;placed, until my pericranium hath been nearly turned with thinking. Unfortu|nately, with my wi&s;h to commence author, originated al&s;o, a mo&s;t inordinate ambition, and an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for applau&s;e. In whatever line I made my appearance, I was &s;olicitous to &s;tand unequalled.&mdash;I would be Ce&s;ar, or I would be nothing. The &s;moothne&s;s of Addi&s;on's page, the purity, &s;trength and correctne&s;s of Swift, the magic numbers of Pope
<PB N="15" REF="034162_0014_0FFC5D827B376898">
&mdash;the&s;e mu&s;t all veil to me. The Homers and Vir|gils of antiquity, I would rival; and, audacious as I am, from the Philenia's of the pre&s;ent age, I would arrogantly &s;natch the bays. Strange as is this ac|count, it is neverthele&s;s true. And, moreover, all the&s;e wild extravagancies have been engendered in a brain, which it may be, doth not po&s;&s;e&s;s abilities ade|quate to the furni&s;hing a paragraph in a common new&s;paper! My ca&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you, Gentlemen, hath been truly pitiable, while, for three years pa&s;t, I have been &s;truggling with an inflatus, which hath been almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible. Rea&s;on, however, aided, as I &s;aid, by a conviction of inferiority, hath hitherto re&s;trained me; but your la&s;t preface hath done the bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;it hath intere&s;ted my feelings, and induced <HI>even rea&s;on</HI> to enli&s;t under the banners of temerity&mdash;the fire thus long pent up, cannot now be &s;mothered, but acquiring, from its confinement, additional fer|vour, it at length produces me a candidate for that applau&s;e, by a pro&s;pect of which, you are &s;olicitous to engage your readers in the arduous pur&s;uit of fame.</P>
<P>Thus re&s;olved, the die is ca&s;t, and this ungovernable mania admits of one only remedy. But having once made up my mind to write, an appellation is the next thing to be con&s;idered; for as to &s;ubjects, my &s;an|guine hopes a&s;&s;ure me they will follow of cour&s;e. A writer of facetious memory, hath repre&s;ented his dear Jenny, when &s;he could not obtain the ti&s;&s;ued robe, as meekly a&s;&s;uming the humble&s;t garb which frugality could furni&s;h. I am fond of re&s;pectable examples, and I have humility enough to be influenced by them.</P>
<P>My title having much exerci&s;ed my mind, and be|ing convinced that any con&s;iderable achievements are beyond my gra&s;p, upon mature deliberation I have thought be&s;t to adopt, and I do hereby adopt, the name, character, and avocation of a GLEANER; and this appellation, I do freely confe&s;s, gives a full and

<P>Here pride &s;ugge&s;ts a que&s;tion, What is any mod|ern &s;cribbler better than a Gleaner? But I very <HI>&s;aga|ciou&s;ly</HI> reply, Let my brethren and &s;i&s;ters of the quill characterize them&s;elves; I &s;hall not thus, upon the very thre&s;hold of the vocation of my election, enter the li&s;ts.</P>
<P>The truth is, I am very fond of my title: I con|ceive that I &s;hall find it in many re&s;pects abundantly convenient; more e&s;pecially, &s;hould an accu&s;ation of plagiari&s;m be lodged again&s;t me, my very <HI>title</HI> will plead my apology; for it would be indeed pitiful if the opulent reaper, who&s;e granaries are confe&s;&s;edly large, and variou&s;ly &s;upplied, &s;hould grudge the poor Gleaner what little he indu&s;triou&s;ly collects, and what, from the richne&s;s and plenty of his ample harve&s;t, he can never want.</P>
<P>With diligence then, I &s;hall ran&s;ack the fields, the meadows, and the groves; each &s;ecret haunt, how|ever &s;eque&s;tered, with avidity I &s;hall explore; deem|ing my&s;elf privileged to crop with impunity a hint from one, an idea from another, and to aim at im|provement upon a &s;entence from a third. I &s;hall give to my materials whatever texture my fancy directs; and, as I &s;aid, feeling my&s;elf entitled to toleration as a Gleaner, in this expre&s;&s;ive name I &s;hall take &s;helter, &s;tanding entirely regardle&s;s of every charge relative to property, originality, and every thing of this nature, which may be preferred again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Mean time, &s;hould any of the Parna&s;&s;ian girls, or his god&s;hip Apollo, or any other genius, &s;ylph, or gnome, of legendary or fairy ance&s;try, fond of encou|raging a young beginner, throw into my ba&s;ket an <HI>unbroken &s;heaf,</HI> you may depend upon it that I will a&s;&s;ay to form the valuable original, with all the care, ac|curacy and &s;kill which clo&s;e thinking, deep &s;tudy, and an ardent de&s;ire to excel, can be&s;tow; and you may far|ther

<P>You, Gentlemen, po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;pecific at which I have already hinted, and by which I may be radically cured; and if this attempt is really as ab&s;urd as I am even now, at times, inclined to think it, your non-in&s;ertion of, and &s;ilence thereto, will operate as effect|ually as the &s;evere&s;t reprehen&s;ion, and will be regard|ed by the Gleaner as a judgment from which there is no appeal.</P>

<P>Ble&s;s me! cried Margaretta, while, in the hope of meeting &s;omething from the pen of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;he threw her fine eyes in a cur&s;ory manner ever the in|dex to the February Magazine. But pray, it may

be a&s;ked, who is Margaretta? Curio&s;ity is, without doubt, a u&s;eful if not a laudable propen&s;ity; and, if it is the parent of many evils, it is but fair to ac|knowledge, that it hath al&s;o among its numerous &s;ons and daughters &s;ome extremely well favoured children. Curio&s;ity hath given birth to the mo&s;t arduous pur|&s;uits; its achievements have been of the greate&s;t util|ity; and without this &s;timulus we &s;hould have great rea&s;on to fear an univer&s;al &s;tagnation in every branch of knowledge. Moreover, this &s;ame curio&s;ity con|&s;orts, at this pre&s;ent, very exactly with my feelings; for the que&s;tion&mdash;Pray, who is Margaretta? involves a &s;ubject upon which I expatiate with infinite &s;atisfac|tion, and upon which I have never yet lo&s;t an oppor|tunity of being loquaciou&s;ly communicative.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the late war, when I was an idle young fellow, fond of indulging my&s;elf in every lux|ury which the &s;mall patrimony that de&s;cended to me from a very worthy father, would permit, I conceived an invincible de&s;ire of becoming a &s;pectator of the felicity which I imagined the inhabitants of South-Carolina, particularly the &s;uffering metropolis of that State, would experience on their emancipation from a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of evils, which, for a period of &s;even years, had continued to occupy their minds, giving them to ta&s;te deeply of every calamity con&s;equent upon a war, conducted in that part of our country with almo&s;t unparalleled barbarity. I had early connected my|&s;elf in the bands of wedlock with a young woman of a mild and conceding di&s;po&s;ition, who &s;incerely loved me, and who, accommodating her&s;elf even to my caprices, hath made it the &s;tudy of her life, when &s;he could not convince my judgment, however ra|tional her arguments in her own e&s;timation, to bend to my purpo&s;es her mo&s;t approved wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>When I announced my intention of vi&s;iting South Carolina, &s;he could not forbear &s;ugge&s;ting &s;ome economical ideas; but upon a declaration that I was determined to execute my plan, &s;he &s;ub|mitted
<PB N="19" REF="034162_0018_0FFC5D7648CEB320">
with that kind of acquie&s;cence, which our &s;ex is &s;o fond of con&s;idering as the proper charac|teri&s;tic of womanhood. For a progre&s;s then of many hundred miles, in a one hor&s;e chai&s;e, we commenced our journey; we intended to pa&s;s on by ea&s;y &s;tages; and, moreover, we were accom|panied by one of the patriotic exiled citizens of Charle&s;ton, with whom, during a &s;truggle which a&s;&s;o|ciated the remote&s;t &s;ubjects of the union, we had contracted an intimate acquaintance. The kindne&s;s of this gentleman, who was well mounted, &s;erving us as a relay, we proceeded expeditiou&s;ly enough, and I do not remember that I ever in my life pa&s;&s;ed my time more agreeably. Many &s;cenes novel and inter|e&s;ting, pro&s;pects exten&s;ive, and views truly pictur|e&s;que, arre&s;ted our attention; and were I not ha&s;ting to give a &s;olution to the reader's que&s;tion, I might perhaps amu&s;e him very tolerably, in the de&s;criptive line, through two or three pages clo&s;e printing; but in a cour&s;e of publications, I may po&s;&s;ibly again re|cur to exhibitions which plea&s;ed me &s;o highly at the time, when I may be more at lei&s;ure to <HI>glean</HI> what|ever flower recollection may furni&s;h.</P>
<P>On our arrival in Charle&s;ton we found our mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations an&s;wered; the joy of the libe|rated citizens was unbounded&mdash;it was beyond de|&s;cription; nor can I give a better idea of their &s;at|isfaction than by pronouncing it in exact proportion to, and fully commen&s;urate with, their preceding &s;ufferings. Our companion, however, was, by the &s;ame unwarrantable mea&s;ures which had wrecked many a princely fortune, &s;tripped of his whole in|heritance; &s;o that being entire &s;trangers in Charle&s;ton, we were nece&s;&s;itated to provide our&s;elves with hired lodgings.</P>
<P>Our landlady was a widow of reputation, who&s;e hou&s;e was frequented only by people of the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection. The &s;econd day after our arrival, as the good woman was pouring the tea, which
<PB N="20" REF="034162_0019_0FFC5D74C708B860">
we had cho&s;en for breakfa&s;t, a gentle tap at the door drew our attention. My wife, who is in fact the pink of civility, was mechanically ri&s;ing to open it, when &s;he was prevented by our ho&s;te&s;s, who cried, Sit down, Madam, it is nobody but the child. My dear Mary, who is extravagantly fond of children, catching at the &s;ound, eagerly replied, "Then, Madam, you have a young family." "No, Madam," returned the ho&s;te&s;s, "it is long &s;ince my young folks have been grown up about me; but this little creature belongs to an unfortunate lodger of mine, who is continually weeping over her, and who I am afraid will not long be an inhabitant of this bad world; indeed I &s;uppo&s;e her pre&s;ent errand is occa|&s;ioned by &s;ome new di&s;tre&s;s of her mother's, for the pretty thing is wonderfully &s;en&s;ible for &s;uch a mere baby." My poor wife, in who&s;e compo&s;ition human|ity is the paramount ingredient, in&s;tantly found her benevolence engaged; all her tender feelings took the alarm; and, precipitately quitting her chair, in a tre|mulous voice &s;he exclaimed, "Pray, Madam, neglect not the unfortunate &s;ick per&s;on for us; I can fill the tea, and I be&s;eech you to admit the little petitioner." The good woman, pronouncing a panegyric upon the tenderne&s;s of my wife's di&s;po&s;ition, forthwith threw open the door, when a little female, apparently about ten years of age, pre&s;ented her&s;elf; &s;he was beautiful as innocence, and her figure was of that kind, which &s;eems formed to intere&s;t every benign principle of the &s;oul; which is calculated to invigorate, even in the bo&s;om of the mo&s;t phlegmatic, the latent &s;parks of pity, although nearly &s;mothered there.</P>
<P>"Oh Mrs. Thrifty!" exclaimed the heart affecting pleader, <Q>will you not come to my mamma? will you not give her &s;ome more of them ble&s;&s;ed drops which ye&s;terday made her &s;o much better? &s;he is&mdash;indeed &s;he is</Q>&mdash;Here, ca&s;ting her eyes toward us, whom her concern had before prevented her from &s;eeing, and who were regarding her with a mixture of pity and
<PB N="21" REF="034162_0020_0FFC5D73459E2410">
admiration, a mode&s;t blu&s;h tinged her cheek, which, even at that early age, had been too often wa&s;hed by the tear of &s;orrow; and, bur&s;ting into an agony of grief, &s;he remained &s;ilent. "Go on, Margaretta, &s;aid Mrs. Thrifty; let us know what new complaint you have to make; this gentleman and lady are very good, and will excu&s;e you." Mary took the hand of the weeping cherub, and drawing her to her, im|printed upon her humid cheek one of tho&s;e balmy ki&s;&s;es which &s;he is always ready to be&s;tow upon the young proficient, thus early enli&s;ted under the ban|ners of misfortune. "Mrs. Thrifty &s;ays right, my dear, every body will love and pity you; tell us, how is your mamma?" The child, hanging upon the arm of my wife, expre&s;&s;ed by her intelligent eyes a thou&s;and mingling &s;en&s;ations; &s;urpri&s;e, love, gratitude, and a corrected kind of joy, &s;eemed to grow at once in her &s;oul; and, bowing upon the hand of Mary in a per|turbed manner, &s;he &s;pontaneou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed the invol|untary emotions of her bo&s;om: <Q>Oh my dear lady, will you not &s;ee my mamma? certainly you can make her well, and &s;he is indeed very &s;ick; I thought this morning &s;he would &s;peak to me no more&mdash;&s;he looked &s;o pale&mdash;and was &s;o long before &s;he bid me repeat my morning hymn: Oh if my poor mamma &s;hould die&mdash;I cannot&mdash;indeed I can|not &s;tay here.</Q></P>
<P>Mary, it will not be doubted, bent her utmo&s;t efforts to &s;oothe the &s;weet mourner. But not to dwell longer upon a &s;ubject, on which it will per|haps be thought I have already too much enlarged, it &s;hall &s;uffice to &s;ay, that, through the good offices of her little friend, Mary &s;oon procured an intro|duction into the chamber of the &s;ick&mdash;that, feel|ings, which at fir&s;t originated in compa&s;&s;ion for the charming child, meliorated into a &s;ympathetic kind of amity&mdash;and that, for the cour&s;e of one week, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a very large proportion of her time in endeav|ouring to mitigate the calamities of the &s;uffering mat|ron,
<PB N="22" REF="034162_0021_0FFC5D6D834F55F8">
Her a&s;&s;iduities, however, were not crowned with the &s;alutary effects &s;he wi&s;hed; the patient, it was but too apparent, was ha&s;tening on to the hour of her di&s;|&s;olution; her di&s;order was a regular decline; the &s;hafts of a deep-rooted and incurable grief, mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be unerring; and it was evident, that in the bo&s;om of the fair afflicted, corroding &s;orrow had in|fixed its envenomed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ooth. My wife often recom|mended a re&s;ignation to, and reliance on, the di&s;po&s;i|tions of a paternal God; but the dying woman &s;hook her head, and continued her pity moving &s;ighs: And about ten days after our abode at Mrs. Thrifty's, the poor lady recovering from a fainting fit, during which it was &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had breathed her la&s;t, &s;ummoned us into her apartment, and, con&s;igning Margaretta to the care of Mrs. Thrifty, &s;he thus addre&s;&s;ed us:&mdash;</P>
<Q><P>You &s;ee before you, my friends&mdash;for friends, &s;hort as is the interval in which I have known you, a num|ber of concurring circum&s;tances evinces you, in the mo&s;t exalted &s;en&s;e of the term, to be; but you are uniformly, I doubt not, the friends of the unfortu|nate, and the Searcher of all hearts knows that my claim to your regards in this character is indubitable. You &s;ee before you, I &s;ay, a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed woman; for the &s;ake of the child who is ju&s;t gone from me, I will briefly recount to you the outlines, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, of my life. She is not, as &s;he &s;up|po&s;es, my daughter&mdash;I never was a mother&mdash;I was the elde&s;t of two &s;i&s;ters, who &s;aw our&s;elves reduced from affluence to penury; we were orphans, and we were, by the rapacious hand of unexampled fraud, de&s;poiled of our patrimony; our mutual affection, however, &s;urvived; and, upon the altar which our misfortunes had erected, we exchanged vows of eter|nal amity. To a &s;mall town in the environs of London we retired, endeavouring to &s;helter our de|fencele&s;s heads, and to &s;eek from hone&s;t indu&s;try, that &s;upport, of which, by faithle&s;s tru&s;tees, we had been robbed.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="034162_0022_0FFC5D6BDAA92260">
My &s;i&s;ter was addre&s;&s;ed by a young man, whom I conceived altogether unworthy of her; for the pride of my heart was yet un&s;ubdued; &s;he, how|ever, notwith&s;tanding all my remon&s;trances, per&s;i&s;ted in encouraging the pur&s;uit of young Melworth; while, &s;o rooted was my aver&s;ion, &s;o impa&s;&s;ioned my decla|rations, and &s;o unyielding the anger which deformed my &s;oul, that I ra&s;hly prote&s;ted, the hour which made them one, &s;hould fix between us an everla&s;ting bar, and that I would on no account, after &s;uch an event, hold with her the &s;malle&s;t intercour&s;e. Their mar|riage neverthele&s;s took place, and to my &s;i&s;ter's en|treaties for a re&s;toration of our former amities, my obdurate heart continued in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>About this time, Captain Arbuthnot made his ap|pearance in our village; a tender friend&s;hip grew between us; it meliorated into love, and he, in &s;ome &s;ort, &s;upplied to me the place of my lo&s;t &s;i&s;ter: Hymen &s;anctified our union, and I e&s;teemed my&s;elf the happie&s;t of women.</P>
<P>Of my &s;i&s;ter, I knew but little; common &s;ame indeed informed me, that &s;he was &s;atisfied with her connexion, that her circum&s;tances were ea&s;y, that &s;he had given birth to one daughter, and with this intel|ligence I was well enough contented. It is true, I was, by private whi&s;pers, a&s;&s;ured that &s;he pined after a reconciliation, and that &s;he had often been heard to &s;ay, that a renewal of our once warm and glow|ing attachment, was the only remaining requi&s;ite which was yet wanting to complete her felicity. Still, however, I was unmoved; and I verily believed that every tender &s;entiment, in regard to my &s;i&s;ter, was eradicated from my bo&s;om. It was at this junc|ture that I accompanied Captain Arbuthnot in a journey of &s;ome months; and on my return, being upon a vi&s;it, among other occurrences which were retailed to me, I learned that Mr. Melworth, having engaged on board a &s;hip which had foundered at &s;ea, every life had been lo&s;t; and that Mrs. Melworth,

who&s;e health was before in a declining &s;tate, was fa&s;t &s;inking under this calamitous event. The feelings of nature, were now, as by a &s;hock of electricity, in|&s;tantly rou&s;ed. Un&s;peakable was the agony of my &s;oul! with the utmo&s;t &s;peed I ha&s;ted to her abode; but alas! I was only in time to receive her la&s;t &s;ighs! the dart which my unkindne&s;s had aimed at her peace, urged by a &s;troke &s;o fatal, deeply transfixed her &s;pirit, and &s;he was ab&s;olutely expiring a martyr to the &s;everity of her fate. Yet, ere &s;he breathed her la&s;t, &s;he bequeathed her little Margaretta to my care. The &s;weet infant, then only two years old, intuitively, as it &s;hould &s;eem, threw her arms about my neck, while in the pre&s;ence of Heaven, and in the hearing of her departing mother, I &s;olemnly &s;wore never to for&s;ake her; and, &s;ince that hour, to &s;helter, to &s;oothe, to re&s;train, and to direct my lovely charge, hath been the prime object of my life; but, yet a little while, and I &s;hall be here no more. Oh thou &s;ainted &s;hade of my much wronged Margaretta! may my death, &s;o &s;imilar to thy own, expiate my inju&s;tice to thee, thou fir&s;t, mo&s;t indulgent, and milde&s;t of women.</P>
<P>In one of the regiments &s;tationed in Ireland, and in the year eighty-one ordered to America, Captain Arbuthnot had a command; he was now my only friend, and with my little orphan, who imagined us her real parents, I re&s;olved to follow his fortunes. We had been induced to &s;uppo&s;e that ca&s;e and afflu|ence awaited us here; that the country was &s;ubdued, and that nothing remained for us but to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the forfeited lands; but we have been mi&s;e|rably deceived. Landing in this city, upon the third of June, as early as the &s;eventh of the &s;ame month, the troops marched under the command of Lord Rawdon, encountering inconceivable difficulties, in a rapid progre&s;s beneath the inten&s;e rays of a burning &s;un, through the whole extent of the State. My un|fortunate hu&s;band fell a victim to the climate, and to the wounds which he received in the engagement,
<PB N="25" REF="034162_0024_0FFC5D65B8E406A0">
which took place near Shubrick's plantation. Need the re&s;t be told?&mdash;Upon the evacuation of Charle&s;ton, I was unable to embark with the troops. For my lit|tle Margaretta, my la&s;t &s;igh will be breathed; it is for her, as I &s;aid, my humane friends, that I have thus long detained you. By the injuries of which they complain, the benevolent feelings of the inhabit|ants of this city are blunted&mdash;what can I do? &s;trang|ers as you are, I &s;olicit your advice&mdash;was &s;he but provided for, my pa&s;&s;age out of time would be ea&s;y; for, with regard to my&s;elf, I know no pro&s;pect &s;o plea&s;ing, as a &s;peedy reunion with my Henry and my much injured &s;i&s;ter&punc; Mary ca&s;t upon me her intelligent eyes; I under&s;tood the reference, and I ha&s;tily replied, If, Madam, your confidence in us is &s;ufficient to calm your mind, you may make your&s;elf entirely ea&s;y about your girl; for, from this moment, we jointly inve&s;t our&s;elves with the guardian&s;hip of the little orphan, and we promi&s;e to con&s;ider her as the child of our affection. This was enough; the matron yielded up her &s;pirit without a remaining re|gret; and, after a&s;&s;i&s;ting at her ob&s;equies, we returned home, well plea&s;ed with our new acqui&s;ition.</P></Q>

my countenance, I endeavoured to pre&s;erve my ac|cu&s;tomed gravity. Margaretta interrogated&mdash;"Dear Sir, did I not lately hear you &s;ay, that if you ever appeared in the world as an author, you would cer|tainly be known by this appellation?"

Had I, immediately on my election, engaged in a compo&s;ition of &s;ome kind or other, (for the ver&s;atility of the title allows the utmo&s;t latitude) had I forthwith &s;ent it forward to the Editors, I &s;hould thus have &s;ecured, by appropria|tion, the de&s;ignation of my choice; but what regrets can redeem the pa&s;t? read it, however, my dear, and let us profit by every means.</P>
<P>The reader will remember that at the time of this confab, the &s;econd number of the Gleaner was not written.</P>
<P>Margaretta read, and when &s;he had fini&s;hed the piece, I proceeded, without commenting thereon, to harangue the good girl, and Mary my wife (though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that few females &s;tand le&s;s in need of lecturing) upon the value of time, upon the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eizing it by the forelock, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. And indeed is there a more e&s;timable gem, a pearl of more intrin&s;ic worth, than that quota of days, which is committed to every hand? and, &s;ince by gra&s;ping the moments we cannot detain them, &s;ince when once they have winged their flight, it is only by reflection that they are known, what indu&s;trious lapidaries ought we to be, that &s;o their radiant influ|ence may emit the mo&s;t &s;uperb and lengthening beams of light. I have long been a warm admirer of that Roman Emperor, who is repre&s;ented as lamenting in &s;o impa&s;&s;ioned a manner, the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle day; and in truth, he could not po&s;&s;ibly have been furni&s;hed with a more rational cau&s;e of regret; for, had he been robbed of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as an individual, the wheel of fortune is &s;till revolving, and his ancient patrimony might have once more been e&s;tabli&s;hed; were his va&s;t dominions in any part di&s;membered, armed for conque&s;t, he might have gone forth, and his victorious arm might po&s;&s;i|bly have reunited the &s;evered di&s;trict; was he de|prived of the choice&s;t of his friends, with the gods they &s;till remained, and futurity would doubtle&s;s

<P>If then, time is a good, which when gone is beyond redemption, utterly and altogether irretrievable, the wonder is, that we are &s;o little attentive to its wa&s;te that in its regulations and di&s;tribution we economize &s;o little! I have thought, that if par&s;imony is ever tolerated, it ought to be in the di&s;po&s;ition of time, and that the penurious hand, when employed in appor|tioning the moments, may with propriety be account|ed under the direction of virtue. It is &s;trange to hear from the mouth of one who murders above half the hours, by con&s;igning them to oblivious &s;leep, a com|plaint of the &s;hortne&s;s of time, and yet nothing is more frequent. Six hours in four and twenty, devoted to &s;leep, when the con&s;titution is naturally good, is &s;aid, by the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians, to be fully adequate to every purpo&s;e of health. If we have accu&s;tomed our&s;elves, when the &s;un is upwards of fifteen hours above our horizon, to pro&s;trate before the drow&s;y god, until the hour of eight in the morn|ing, let us by per&s;everance acquire the habit of quitting our pillows at five, at a moment when the blu&s;hing face of nature is clothed in tranquillity; when every breeze &s;eems commi&s;&s;ioned to invigorate the mind; when the weary frame which the evening before &s;unk down languid, debilitated, and almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, is as it were renovated; when, aided by

But it is not enough that we become careful to enrich our&s;elves by an accumulation of hours, an exact attention to their appropriation being to the full as requi&s;ite.

<P>I wi&s;h not, &s;aid Erne&s;tus to Cra&s;tinatus, to entru&s;t my only &s;on to the fluctuating waves of the treacherous ocean; but, in my opinion, neither Charybdis nor Scyl|la, though armed with all the terrors once attributed to them, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lf &s;o fatal to a young fellow, as a mind unoccupied by laudable pur&s;uits, and that pernicious habit of idly di&s;&s;ipating time, which hath da&s;hed &s;o many high rai&s;ed hopes.

<Q><L>But let us give the pre&s;ent times their due.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is &s;carce an ob&s;erver in all the purlieus of contemplation, but mu&s;t recollect, in &s;ome part or other of his life, to have met with &s;pirited declamations upon the degeneracy of the times. O Tempora! O Mores! is an exclamation frequently in the mouths of tho&s;e who inherit much, and who are, by the good and whole&s;ome laws of their coun|try, guaranteed the peaceable enjoyment of their am|ple po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. There is a &s;et of people who can never &s;ee a tax-bill, or attend to the requi&s;itions of government, without mutinou&s;ly, if not treacherou&s;ly, running the parallel between what they term the pre&s;ent exorbitant demands, and the moderate char|ges of the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration; and while they are blind to the emoluments of independence, they &s;eem to forget that <HI>hou&s;e keeping is of nece&s;&s;ity more expen&s;ive than a re&s;idence in the dwelling of a parent or a ma&s;ter</HI> If the &s;pirit of di&s;content was peculiar to the&s;e incon|&s;iderate cavillers, it would be well; but we are con|cerned to find, that it pervades all orders of men, from the philo&s;opher down to the verie&s;t grumbler&mdash;from the prie&s;t to the cobler&mdash;from the aggrandized lawyer to his fleeced client&mdash;from the mo&s;t enlight|ened phy&s;ician to his &s;uffering patient&mdash;from the &s;tate&s;man to the beggar&mdash;and from the liberally en|dowed and independent gentleman to the common day's labourer. In &s;hort, every de&s;cription of peo|ple are found crying out on the depravity of the times; and were we to give full credit to the te&s;ti|mony of tho&s;e, who, from age to age, have taken an unaccountable plea&s;ure in <HI>depreciating the time being,</HI> we &s;hould be ready to conclude, that we mu&s;t at length have arrived at the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of turpitude,
<PB N="33" REF="034162_0032_0FFC5D5353A95B10">
and have become adepts in every &s;pecies of atrocious criminality. Yet the accu&s;ation proceeds from the lips of very re&s;pectable complainants, who&s;e judg|ment, in many re&s;pects, is hardly problematical, and to who&s;e deci&s;ions we &s;ubmit perhaps with too much docility.</P>
<P>In order to exalt the ancients, and to render them &s;upreme in the &s;cale of excellence, it is cu&s;tomary to level the moderns; and the fame of the one is appre|ciated, in an exact ratio, as that of the other is under|valued.</P>
<P>We are told much of the <HI>golden age;</HI> but the mo&s;t careful inve&s;tigator is at a lo&s;s at what period of the world to date its epoch; &s;ince, immediately upon the expul&s;ion of Adam from the paradi&s;e which he had forfeited, the battery of hatred and malevolence was opened; grants were abroad in the earth, and nations no &s;ooner exi&s;ted, than they learned war.</P>
<P>The golden age, then, with all its &s;plendid charac|teri&s;tics, we are feign to con&s;ign to the region of fancy, denying it a being, but in the breath of poetic fiction, or the annals of imagination.</P>
<P>The &s;uperiority which we are &s;o ready to award to the ancients, may be equally without any foundation in reality; and it is in my humble opinion probable, that their principal advantages were derived from their being fir&s;t upon the &s;tage of action. Methinks I &s;ee the blu&s;h of indignation tinge the face of the reader, and he is ready to execrate the Gleaner, for attempting to pluck from the venerable brow of an|tiquity the &s;malle&s;t twig of fame. Yet, while I reverence a prejudice, which very po&s;&s;ibly originates in the mo&s;t laudable affections, I neverthele&s;s reply&mdash;But let us give revolving time its due. Pray, my good Sir, or Madam, if a certain opulent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is endowed with va&s;t dominions, in con&s;equence of his elder&s;hip&mdash;am I, an hone&s;t Gleaner, to whom only a few barren tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> remain, or who&s;e lot, perhaps, it is to examine with unwearied diligence every &s;pot of

the wide domain, if perchance I may glean the pit|tance which affluence has overlooked&mdash;am I, for this, in a judgment of unimpa&s;&s;ioned rea&s;on, to be the le&s;s regarded? or, what principle of equity, pa&s;&s;ing &s;en|tence without a trial, will pronounce, that had I been placed preci&s;ely in the &s;ituation of the original occu|pier, I might not have laid out my grounds to equal advantage, &s;upporting a character to the full as dig|nified, as con&s;i&s;tent, and as becoming.</P>
<P>Man is u&s;hered into being; he finds him&s;elf ex|po&s;ed to all the vici&s;&s;itudes with which the various &s;ea&s;ons are replete; the wintery &s;torms are abroad; hail, rain and &s;now po&s;&s;e&s;s a power e&s;&s;entially to afflict him; he burns beneath a torrid zone, or he freezes beneath a frigid; in &s;hort, every thing points out to him the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;helter, and accord|ingly, he &s;inks the hollowed cavity, or he rai&s;es the thatched hut; with proper repairs, this homely dwel|ling would an&s;wer full as well for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; but his &s;on improves thereon, and every generation adds &s;omething, till at length the fini&s;hed edifice becomes complete. Now, I would a&s;k, is not every genera|tion entitled to its quota of prai&s;e? and &s;ince the ori|ginal inventor was urged merely by nece&s;&s;ity, and performed no more than what the beaver and other animals have frequently done, may not the <HI>improver,</HI> who had not this incitement, come in for his full &s;hare?</P>
<P>Surely the annals of antiquity record in&s;tances of barbari&s;m in per&s;ons, when the manners were deemed highly poli&s;hed, which would &s;hock the pre&s;ent feel|ings of the mo&s;t illiterate. Let us take a view of the Athenians, at an era when a &s;tate of great refine|ment was attributed to them, when they were, it is &s;aid, an intelligent and a learned people; let us take a &s;eat in their theatre; let us li&s;ten while they, al|mo&s;t unanimou&s;ly, applaud the coar&s;e ribaldry of an Ari&s;tophanes, while they complacently attend the degradation of virtue, encouraging a rude and indel|icate

buffoon to hold up a Socrates as a fit &s;ubject for the ridicule of the people!</P>
<P>But the ancients made many di&s;coveries&mdash;very true&mdash;and is not the rea&s;on obvious? <HI>There was much to di&s;cover;</HI> moreover, nece&s;&s;ity, as hath been before hinted, is an excellent &s;timulus to promptitude; yet, in &s;ome re&s;pects, it would &s;eem that they were va&s;tly deficient in ingenuity: For example; through re|volving centuries they remained ignorant of the art of printing, by which they might &s;o eligibly have tran&s;mitted to us their elaborate productions, although they could not &s;et a foot upon the <HI>yielding</HI> earth, with|out producing an <HI>impre&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;ufficient to &s;ugge&s;t to them &s;o valuable an idea.</P>
<P>The education of a modern &s;tudent is by no means fini&s;hed, without an exten&s;ive acquaintance with the hi&s;tory, learning, manners and cu&s;toms of the an|cients; the be&s;t part of his life is therefore devoted to acquire this knowledge, and when thus accom|pli&s;hed, he finds that the age of fancy is well near fled, and that to him the door of originality &s;eems effectually barred. The &s;tudent of antiquity was not thus encumbered; from his predece&s;&s;ors he had little to reap, and the volume of nature was opened before him; yet his acquirements were often &s;uperficial, while the deepe&s;t re&s;earches, with their con&s;equent improvements, were re&s;erved for later ages.</P>
<P>How dreadful are the preparations for war, which the page of antiquity recounts! their terrific habili|ments; their deathful chariots; their elephants, with all the &s;hocking apparatus! &s;carcely are they exceed|ed by the arrangements of an American &s;avage, and hardly are the tortures which he meditates, more fearfully tremendous. What &s;cenes of blood and de|va&s;tation doth the annals of ancient hi&s;tory exhibit! how frequently are the feelings of humanity pierced to the very &s;oul! what fratricide! what parricide! while in&s;tances are not wanting of <HI>mothers,</HI> who wade to empire through the blood of tho&s;e children, in

<P>The government of the ancients, whether demo|cratical, ari&s;tocratical, monarchical, &s;imple or mixed; all the&s;e, if examined by the eye of impartiality, the boa&s;ted wi&s;dom of their legi&s;lators, yielding in many re&s;pects to modern improvements, will, if I mi&s;take not, by exactly &s;triking the balance, prove the arrange|ments of Deity to be equal, and manife&s;t him di&s;trib|uting with a paternal hand, to every age their exact proportion of talents, endowing every divi&s;ion of time, with men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing under&s;tandings alike capable of profiting by the circum&s;tances in which they were involved. With regard to the religion of the an|cients, I &s;uppo&s;e it will be granted, that it was a heap of ab&s;urdities; that it con&s;i&s;ted of contradictions, im|purities, and my&s;teries; the character of their very deities are lewd and otherwi&s;e immoral; with the ri|val&s;hip and content on of their gods we are di&s;gu&s;ted; and even the hi&s;tory of their Jupiter is replete with crimes, that abundantly ju&s;tify the ill humour of his Juno, that would have warranted the mo&s;t coercive proceed|ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t him, for which he merited condign pun|i&s;hment, and which would have induced us wholly to acquit his brothers, Pluto and Neptune, (their own enormities notwith&s;tanding) if they had, uniting their powers, precipitated him from his Olympian height, and confined him in adamantine chains to the Sty|gian flood, or the Tartarean gulph.</P>
<P>But to re&s;ume the language of rea&s;on; this fond predilection for, and preference of the ancients, is, in reality, altogether unaccountable; it is a &s;ingular trait in the hi&s;tory of mankind, &s;ince, in every other in&s;tance, the per&s;ons, places and things, with which we have a&s;&s;ociated, and to which we are accu&s;tomed, po&s;&s;e&s;s a charm, the blandi&s;hments of which we find

it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape: With what ardour do we re|member the &s;cenes of our youth! upon the tablets of our brea&s;ts how indelibly is the love of the place of our nativity engraved! what noble enthu&s;ia&s;m fires the patriotic mind, when the intere&s;ts of his country are at &s;take, and how gladly would the man of filial integrity, &s;acrifice his faire&s;t hours, to advance the importance of his parent &s;oil!

The idea, which to embody and effectuate, I would not only relinqui&s;h whole years of my exi&s;tence, but I would ab&s;olutely be contented to live and die in ob&s;curity, originated in an hour, which having appropriated to &s;ome choice &s;pirits, I pa&s;&s;ed convivially over a bottle; we were not, however, bacchanalians, and our wine but &s;erved to meliorate and give an edge to our reflections.</P>

Our &s;ubjects were multifarious, and with the ut|mo&s;t freedom we arraigned, tried, and condemned. Among other matters of &s;peculation which we had taken it upon us liberally to analyze and critically to &s;can, the cau&s;e of the little encouragement which is generally throughout the world, and e&s;pecially in our own country, given to genius, we carefully en|deavoured to inve&s;tigate; but for this ab&s;urdity, it was in vain that we a&s;&s;ayed rationally to account; and we were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of lamenting a fact, the &s;ources of which, our utmo&s;t re&s;earches could not penetrate. The di&s;appointments of a Butler, the melancholy fate of an Otway, with a long train of et-ceteras, we could not review, without pathetically deploring; and &s;o far were we from conceiving that the ta&s;te of the pre&s;ent times was in any degree refined, that one of our party gave it as his decided opinion, that if Pope, Addi&s;on and Swift flouri&s;hed in America, their merit would be almo&s;t entirely di&s;regarded, and that there would &s;carce be found a &s;ingle wight, who would acknowledge their &s;uperior claims. From regretting, we naturally proceeded to devi&s;ing the ways and means, and our pericraniums were fruitful in expedients to remedy an evil which we regarded as a real blot upon the ri&s;ing fame of this new world. After many pro's and con's, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed among us, (and I do a&s;&s;ure you there was in our junto many re&s;pectable per&s;ons) that it would be a mo&s;t happy arrangement, if the con&s;ti|tution of the United States of America would admit an additional article, providing for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>real genius,</HI> whether it be found in the male or female world. It is not &s;eldom the ca&s;e, that, to an&s;wer the pre&s;&s;ing wants of life, the efforts of the mind are &s;o wholly engro&s;&s;ed, that the operations of genius are &s;u&s;pended, if not wholly bla&s;ted, and the door to intellectual fame is thus of nece&s;&s;ity barred. Again&s;t this inconvenience, in its utmo&s;t latitude, our plan went to the providing. Congre&s;s &s;hould appoint per&s;ons, duly qualified to examine every

<P>BEING nece&s;&s;itated, in the cour&s;e of my bu&s;ine&s;s, to make frequent vi&s;its to our metropolis; and bearing about me, neither in my per&s;on, or habili|ments, any di&s;tingui&s;hing mark, I have the advantage of mixing unnoticed, in places of general re&s;ort, with people of various de&s;criptions, and not &s;eldom of im|portant characters. It was in one of my late excur|&s;ions, that I found my&s;elf at a table where the gue&s;ts took their &s;eats with that freedom which is &s;o eligible, and which is always tolerated in a public hou&s;e. After playing their parts, like men who perfectly well under&s;tood them&s;elves, &s;wallowing a &s;ufficient quantity of ham and chicken, and liberally moi&s;tening the clay with the juice of the apple, they imagined them&s;elves duly qualified to &s;it as judges of literary merit; for my own part, I am obliged to confe&s;s, that in regard to the gifts requi&s;ite in conver&s;ation, nature hath been unto me a perfect niggard, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;e&s;s not, in orally delivering my ideas, the &s;malle&s;t degree of facility.

<P>I was amazed to find with how little accuracy, and with what arrogant freedom, their dogmatizing

deci&s;ions were, for the mo&s;t part, made; and I felt a kind of horror at the mangling of names, which I had accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to con&s;ider in the mo&s;t re&s;pectable point of view. From que&s;tioning the correctne&s;s and the delicacy of Addi&s;on, the wit of Swift, and the poetical merit of Pope, they &s;um|moned before their imperious tribunal, the candidates for fame, which, in this younger world, di&s;tingui&s;h the pre&s;ent day: Trumbull, Barlow, Humphreys, Warren, Morton, Belknap, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;the&s;e all pa&s;&s;ed in review before them; and as they &s;eemed determined to &s;et no bounds to their invidious cen&s;ures, their ob&s;ervations were of cour&s;e equally de&s;titute of ju&s;tice and of candour. From the&s;e luminous bodies in the hemi&s;phere of literature, de&s;cending in their career, they fell pell-mell upon the poor Gleaner. He was regarded as free plunder, &s;erving as a mark at which to point their keene&s;t &s;hafts of &s;atire; he was <HI>any body, every body,</HI> or <HI>nobody.</HI> One while he was certainly a <HI>Par&s;on,</HI> for, in his la&s;t number, throwing off the ma&s;k, he had po&s;itively &s;ermonized throughout; it was true he had taken his text from a brother chip; but what of that? his &s;peech betrayed him. A &s;econd gravely declared, that he was credibly informed, the Gleaner was, at this pre&s;ent, a &s;tudent in Harvard College; and indeed, (he added) it is <HI>evident, that he needs in&s;truction.</HI> Here a loud laugh interrupted, for a moment, the progre&s;s of their critical and judicious remarks; when a young barri&s;ter, taking up the matter, for the &s;ake of the argument, ju&s;t to exerci&s;e his talents, profe&s;&s;ionally pronounced, that mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t had been gro&s;sly impo&s;ed upon, in the plea of ve&s;ting the prop|erty under con&s;ideration; for that the Gleaner cer|tainly bore &s;trong marks of genius&punc; that, to his knowl|edge, it was the production of a Connecticut p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and it was well known that Connecticut was the land of e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts. A magi&s;terial voice now interfered&mdash;P&s;haw, p&s;haw, brother litigant, I &s;ay you are wrong, ab&s;olutely wrong; for if we except the fir&s;t number of

the Gleaner, there is not to be found, in that writer, a &s;ingle &s;entence of &s;heer wit. From the fir&s;t number, indeed, I encouraged a hope of originality, of a &s;pe|cies of entertainment, not every day to be met with; but that, it &s;hould &s;eem, was a forced matter, a mere hot-bed production, a &s;park &s;truck from a flint, rather than the offspring of that pure, cele&s;tial and immor|tal fire, which, like its ethereal &s;ource, can never be extingui&s;hed, and which, ever genuine, glowing, and animated, is with propriety hailed by that dignify|ing appellation&mdash;true genius. But the Gleaner, O &s;hocking! in his Margaretta, indeed, I took an inter|e&s;t, but he ju&s;t p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pt her upon us, and very &s;oon run|ning him&s;elf out there, whip, in a moment, &s;he was gone.

A middle-aged gentleman, who &s;at at the bottom of the table, and who had been, till then, &s;ilent, actu|ated, as I conceive, by a kind of &s;ympathy, being him&s;elf probably a &s;upplicant at the &s;hrine of fame, now joined in the conver&s;ation, by candidly &s;ugge&s;t|ing, that it did not appear the Gleaner had laid any claim to extraordinary talents; that he had very early renounced the vain hopes by which he had been inflated; that if every writer could not reach the eminence of a Boyle, a Locke, or a Newton, yet tho&s;e who were contented with the &s;ubordination of their &s;everal departments, were entitled to their quota of prai&s;e; that if the ob&s;ervations of the Gleaner were trite, he was but a Gleaner, and the mode&s;ty of his preten&s;ions entitled him to the full exerci&s;e of candor. But your Honor, (continued the good-natured gentleman) was intere&s;ted in his Margaretta; now I think it very po&s;&s;ible that Mi&s;s Melworth may again make her appearance, and it is my opinion, that the Gleaner withholds her now, not altogether from poverty of genius, but from the fear of giving

to his productions the air of a novel&mdash;(I could hardly forbear taking my advocate in my arms)&mdash;and you know, Gentlemen, in what a frivolous point of view, the noveli&s;t, at this pre&s;ent, &s;tands. It is painful to &s;ink, and who would wi&s;h to deba&s;e the e&s;&s;aye&s;t (for &s;o it would be e&s;teemed) into a mere annali&s;t of brilliant fictions; yet, for my own part, I am free to own, that I cla&s;s this &s;pecies of writing in the very highe&s;t grade of excellence; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t is true that the be&s;t things may be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the wor&s;t of pur|po&s;es, and the pen, &s;eized by the &s;ingers of imagina|tion, hath not &s;eldom proved licentiou&s;ly luxurious. Thus, even a Richard&s;on, though his writings abound with the pure&s;t morals, and though his Clari&s;&s;a, with a &s;ingle exception, may be regarded as a model, cannot, perhaps, be con&s;idered as altogether faultle&s;s; yet I have thought, that under proper regulations, the province a&s;&s;igned to the novel writer, might be productive of the highe&s;t utility; love, I would not hail as almighty; I would not create a de&s;pot, before who&s;e throne every other con&s;ideration mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, pro&s;trate; I would not repre&s;ent him as reducing to va&s;&s;alage every faculty of the &s;oul, and riding victorious over decency, propriety, and every other virtue; but I would de&s;cribe him as a benign monarch, to whom rea&s;on &s;hould admini&s;ter; his powers &s;hould be limited, and cha&s;tized by prudence; and, by a &s;eries of intere&s;ting, circum&s;tantial and well dige&s;ted narrations, I would produce events deeply marked, and &s;trikingly natural, which &s;hould indi&s;putably evince the triumphs of di&s;cretion over the impa&s;&s;ioned dictates of the perturbed &s;pirit; vol|umes, wrote upon &s;uch a plan, would, I venture to a&s;&s;ert, be more &s;erviceable to the intere&s;ts of virtue than even the ethic page; for, however plau&s;ibly we may harangue, the voice of the narrator will &s;till be heard, when, perhaps, the mo&s;t elaborate e&s;&s;ays, not thus embelli&s;hed, which ever i&s;&s;ued from the clo&s;et of the &s;tudious, will pa&s;s the torpid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar without leaving the &s;lighte&s;t impre&s;&s;ion.

<SALUTE>GOOD MAN GLEANER.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM, d'ye &s;ee, an old &s;ea commander, and many a tough bout have I had on it in my day; with the wind in my teeth, I have been blown hither and thither, coa&s;t wi&s;e, and every wi&s;e; but what of that? with a pretty breeze, mayhap, I can carry as much &s;ail, and &s;teer as &s;trait forward as another man. Now I have been plaguily puzzled to know at what you were driving: I never, in the whole cour&s;e of my life, was fond of an uncertain navigation, becau&s;e,
<PB N="59" REF="034162_0058_0FFC5D009B159800">
d'ye &s;ee, there is no knowing what rocks and quick|&s;ands may take one up. For my part, I never wa&s;t|ed many gla&s;&s;es in poring over your books, and your hi&s;tories, and all that&mdash;not I&mdash;it was my bu&s;ine&s;s to mind how the &s;hip worked, to &s;ee if &s;he made good way, and failed as many knots in an hour as the charming Sall, or Bet. When I was a lad, my father &s;ent me to &s;chool, and would have made a par&s;on of me; but it would not do&mdash;the wind pointed another way, and &s;o I up jib, and bore away, making all the &s;ail I could to more convenient moor|ings: How&s;omever, I learned enough of the art to en|able me to make an ob&s;ervation, by the help of which I can carry my &s;hip round the globe, pa&s;&s;ing with &s;afety through the narrowe&s;t &s;traits, always keeping her clear of a lee &s;hore, and never running foul of any rock or &s;hoal, though I have made ever &s;o many voyages; but I always kept a good look out, was careful to heave the log, attending, with my own eyes, to the veerings, and my reckonings were as &s;ure and as certain as the rock of Gibraltar. But what is all this to the purpo&s;e? ava&s;t a moment, and you &s;hall hear. Being pretty much weather beaten, I thought be&s;t, &s;ome|time &s;ince, to make the &s;afe and convenient harbour of matrimony, and my daughter Molly, for that was the &s;ober name we gave her at the fount, though, by the bye, my wife very &s;oon tacking about, cho&s;e to call her Maria, till returning from a trip &s;he hath made to a neighbouring town, the wind again &s;hifting, there is nothing &s;o proper, &s;o &s;edate, and which, &s;he &s;ays, &s;quares &s;o well with her ideas, as Mary; thus reducing us to the nece&s;&s;ity of beginning our traver&s;e anew; well, but my &s;aid daughter Molly, Maria, or Mary, being born ju&s;t a year after our marriage, and very &s;oon becoming a fine ro&s;y cheeked girl, I have ever &s;ince been examining every point of direction, &s;o belaying the lifts and the braces, the clewlines and the buntlines, that &s;he may be as good a &s;ail, make as good way, and procure as good a birth, as any little tight &s;ea boat of them all. Her mother was for

putting her adrift at a boarding &s;chool, but by virtue of my authority, I have hitherto kept her in her old moorings, being hugely afraid of the breakers, which &s;he may encounter upon the ocean of inexperience; but my education being &s;uch as I have &s;aid, I am &s;omething &s;u&s;picious that I may not perfectly under|&s;tand every point of the compa&s;s; and being embark|ed in &s;o difficult a navigation, I am, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince I undertook the command of a &s;hip, rather doubtful of my cour&s;e. Now you mu&s;t know, that though I am no reader, I have, in order to find out by the entries and clearances, which way the wind &s;ets with my old comrades, made it my practice to take on board the news-papers; that &s;ince my mat|rimonial adventure, I have al&s;o &s;hipped their fir&s;t cou&s;ins, the magazines, and that one cold evening, upon the fir&s;t of April la&s;t, my wife and I being &s;afely hauled up along &s;ide of a good fire, were mightily taken with your Margaretta, and that im|mediately &s;triking our colours, we lovingly agreed to di&s;po&s;e of our Molly, preci&s;ely as you &s;hould inform us you had done of the little yawl belayed along &s;ide your anchorage by dame Arbuthnot; but now, Mr. Gleaner, I am coming to the point; though we have ever &s;ince kept watch and watch, placing upon the ma&s;t-head of &s;crutiny the careful eye of intelligence, yet we cannot e&s;py the &s;malle&s;t appearance of the little &s;kiff for which we are looking out; on the con|trary, you &s;eem to have hoi&s;ted every &s;ail, bearing directly from the port to which we &s;uppo&s;ed you were bound! And pray now what have you got by all this? I doubt your voyage will prove rather unprofitable; for, &s;ay what you will, people will turn in when they plea&s;e, and though your mornings &s;hould break ten times hand&s;omer, they will not quit their cabins a &s;ingle gla&s;s the &s;ooner. It is true, you have taken us a round about cour&s;e to Athens, and the Lord knows where, paraphra&s;ing upon the times, and the times, though you do not make them a rope's end the better: and I know, in the very teeth of all

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS early left an orphan, and my education was much neglected; but neverthele&s;s, a variety of con|curring circum&s;tances, di&s;po&s;ing the heart of a very worthy gentleman in my favour, I happily became his wife. For a few years, the hi&s;tory of my life may be regarded as the annals of felicity; but alas! I have laid my hu&s;band in the grave, and the &s;tory of my enjoyments is fini&s;hed; yet, in a little daughter, I once again revive; my girl &s;till attaches me to humanity. I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what I deem a competency; and, being entru&s;ted by her decea&s;ed father with the entire di&s;po&s;al of my child, I would adopt, in the forming of her mind, that &s;y&s;tem, which may be the be&s;t calculated to make her good and happy.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, I have looked with very much anxiety, into every late publication, which I have thought calculated for the meridian of my under&s;tanding; and in this pur&s;uit, your lovely or|phan very naturally attracted my attention; if I was amu&s;ed with an agreeable fiction, I was, neverthele&s;s, intere&s;ted and plea&s;ed; if the charming &s;tranger was endowed with more than a fanciful exi&s;tence, I &s;hed tears of joy that &s;he had found upon this Amer|ican &s;hore &s;o able a patron; and I have for many weeks expected from your gentle Mary, and her beau|teous Margaretta, &s;ome hint, whereby to &s;hape my future conduct.

<P>AS I &s;uppo&s;e it will be your care to di&s;po&s;e of Mi&s;s Melworth to the be&s;t advantage; as I think that &s;he mu&s;t now be marriageable, and as I have been for &s;ome time looking out for a wife, I have thought be&s;t to addre&s;s you upon the &s;ubject. Indeed, I &s;hould have wrote you before; but expecting, every number, to hear &s;omething further of the girl, I po&s;tponed my intention, until by your long-winded remarks, (you will pardon me, Sir) my patience is quite exhau&s;ted. In truth, as I am turned of fifty, I have no time to &s;pare; and having a hand&s;ome and di&s;encumbered e&s;tate, it is fit that I procure lineal de&s;cendants, who, in ca&s;e of my decea&s;e, may become legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. From applying to the girls of our day, whom I have &s;een, notwith&s;tanding your opinion of "<HI>the pre&s;ent times,</HI>" I am deterred by the little chance which a man hath of obtaining a woman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that di&s;cretion which is &s;o requi&s;ite in a wife; for, what with <HI>morning vi&s;its, family and public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;mall &s;trolling, evening tea parties, mid|night <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and the time which is nece&s;&s;arily devoted to &s;leep and dre&s;&s;ing, the four and twenty hours are completely filled up!

Mrs. Aburthnot, &s;he hath continued to progre&s;s in our affections, endearing her&s;elf to us by every act of duty, and having laid her in our bo&s;om, &s;he hath be|come unto us indeed a daughter. Heaven hath de|nied us children; but we regret not that circum&s;tance, while this amiable female lives to prop, to &s;oothe, and to &s;lope our pa&s;&s;age through the journey of life. Having packed up her little moveables, the mo&s;t val|uable of which was a miniature of her mother, put into her hands by her aunt (who&s;e degree of affinity &s;he hath &s;ince under&s;tood) ju&s;t before &s;he expired, we quitted the capital of South-Carolina. I took a place for my&s;elf in the &s;tage; and Mary, accommodating her&s;elf to the movements of that vehicle, came on with the child. Mary hath the peculiar talent of &s;tealing from the unfortunate their &s;harpe&s;t &s;orrows; moments of the keene&s;t angui&s;h &s;he can &s;ometimes beguile; and by her addre&s;s &s;he hath not &s;eldom ex|tracted from the wounded bo&s;om the lacerating &s;haft. To &s;oothe and to &s;upport the little Margaretta, who was at fir&s;t overwhelmed with grief, &s;he bent her ut|mo&s;t efforts; and as the minds of children, at that early and intere&s;ting age, are commonly very &s;u&s;cep|tible, and ea&s;ily impre&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;ucceeded wonderfully well; while the little creature, a&s;&s;ured and comfort|ed, before we had reached the northern extremity of the middle States, with her heart as light as the go&s;|&s;amer, prattled away mo&s;t delightfully.</P>
<P>When we returned home, we fitted up a little chamber, of which we con&s;tituted Margaretta the &s;ole proprietor; my wife informing her that &s;he &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;t betwixt her apartment and her own, that if they cho&s;e, upon any occa&s;ion, to &s;eparate, they might with the greater convenience open a cor|re&s;pondence by letter. The rudiments of Margaret|ta's education had been attended to; in her plain work &s;he had made con&s;iderable proficiency; &s;he could read the &s;eventh, tenth, eleventh and twelfth chapters of Nehemiah, without much difficulty; and when her aunt was taken ill, &s;he was on the point of

being put into joining-hand; but Mary very &s;oon &s;ketched out for our charge rather an exten&s;ive plan of education; and as I was not entirely convinced of the inutility of her views, the natural indolence of my temper induced me to let the matter pa&s;s, without en|tering my caveat by way of &s;topping proceedings; and indeed, I think the propriety of circum&s;cribing the education of a female, within &s;uch narrow bounds as are frequently a&s;&s;igned, is at lea&s;t problematical. A celebrated writer, I really forget who, hath penned upon this &s;ubject a number of &s;elf-evident truths; and it is an incontrovertible fact, that to the matron is en|tru&s;ted not only the care of her daughter, but al&s;o the forming the fir&s;t and oftentimes the mo&s;t important movements of that mind, which is to inform the fu|ture man; the early dawnings of rea&s;on &s;he is ap|pointed to watch, and from her are received the mo&s;t indelible impre&s;&s;ions of his life. Now, was &s;he properly qualified, how enviable and how dignified would be her employment. The probability is, that the family of children, whom &s;he directed, &s;uppo&s;ing them to po&s;&s;e&s;s common capacities, being once initiat|ed into the flowery paths of &s;cience, would &s;eldom &s;top &s;hort of the de&s;ired goal. Fine writing, arithme|tic, geography, a&s;tronomy, mu&s;ic, drawing; an attach|ment to all the&s;e might be formed in infancy; the fir&s;t principles of the fine arts might be &s;o accommodated, as to con&s;titute the pa&s;time of the child; the &s;eeds of knowledge might be implanted in the tender mind, and even budding there, before the avocations of the father permitted him to combine his efforts. Affec|tion for the &s;weet preceptre&s;s, would originate a &s;trong predilection for in&s;tructions, that would with intere&s;t|ing tenderne&s;s be given, and that would be made to a&s;&s;ume the face of entertainment, and thus the young proficient would be, almo&s;t imperceptibly, engaged in tho&s;e walks, in which an advantageous per&s;everance might rationally be expected.

her children, I conceive, will find it little more diffi|cult to teach them to li&s;p in two languages, than in one: and as the powers of the &s;tudent advanceth, cer|tain portions of the day may be regularly appropriat|ed to the conver&s;ing in that language which is not de&s;igned for the common intercour&s;es of life. Let|ters, in either tongue, to the parent, or fictitious char|acters, may be alternately written, and thus an ele|gant knowledge of both may be gradually obtained. Learning, certainly, can never with propriety be e&s;teemed a burthen; and when the mind is judiciou&s;ly balanced, it renders the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or not only more valu|able, but al&s;o more amiable, and more generally u&s;e|ful. Literary acqui&s;itions cannot, unle&s;s the facul|ties of the mind are deranged, be lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t; and while the goods of fortune may be whelmed beneath the contin|gencies of revolving time, intellectual property &s;till remains, and the mental funds can never be exhau&s;t|ed. The accompli&s;hed, the liberally accompli&s;hed female, if &s;he is de&s;tined to move in the line of com|petency, will be regarded as a plea&s;ing and in&s;truc|tive companion; whatever &s;he does will connect an air of per&s;ua&s;ive elevation; wherever &s;he may be ad|ventitiou&s;ly called, genuine dignity will be the accom|paniment of her &s;teps; &s;he will always be attended to with plea&s;ure, and &s;he cannot fail of being di&s;tin|gui&s;hed; &s;hould &s;he, in her career of life, be arre&s;ted by adver&s;e fortune, many re&s;ources of relief, of plea&s;|ure, and of emolument, open them&s;elves before her; and &s;he is not <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> condemned to laborious ef|forts, or to the drudgery of that unremitted &s;amene&s;s, which the rotine of the needle pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the merits of the cour&s;e which I am thus <HI>apparently</HI> advocating, without &s;topping to examine the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, I proceed to &s;ay, that the plan of education adopted for Marga|retta was, as I have already hinted, &s;ufficiently ex|ten&s;ive, and that Mrs. Vigillius (to addre&s;s my good wife, in her dignified character of governante, with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect) having in&s;tructed her pupil in the
<PB N="70" REF="034162_0069_0FFC5CDAE6DDD058">
grand fundamental points of the philanthropic re|ligion of Je&s;us, was never ea&s;y while any branch of improvement, which could by the mo&s;t remote con|&s;truction be deemed feminine, remained une&s;&s;ayed; and I mu&s;t in ju&s;tice declare, that the con&s;equence, by producing Margaretta at the age of &s;ixteen, a beautiful and accompli&s;hed girl, more than an&s;wered her mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations.</P>
<P>Of needle work, in its varieties, my wife pronounc|ed her a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s; her knowledge of the Eng|li&s;h, and French tongues, was fully adequate to her years, and her manner of reading had, for me, pe|culiar charms; her hand writing was neat and ea&s;y; &s;he was a good accomptant, a tolerable geographer and chronologi&s;t; &s;he had &s;kimmed the &s;urface of a&s;|tronomy and natural philo&s;ophy; had made good proficiency in her &s;tudy of hi&s;tory and the poets; could &s;ketch a land&s;cape; could furni&s;h, from her own fancy, patterns for the mu&s;lins which &s;he wrought; could bear her part in a minuet and a co|tillion, and was allowed to have an excellent hand upon the piano forte. We once entertained a de|&s;ign of debarring her the indulgence of novels; but tho&s;e books, being in the hands of every one, we conceived the accompli&s;hment of our wi&s;hes in this re&s;pect, except we had bred her an ab&s;olute reclu&s;e, almo&s;t impracticable; and Mrs. Vigillius, therefore, thought it be&s;t to permit the u&s;e of every decent work, cau&s;ing them to be read in her pre&s;ence, hoping that &s;he might, by her &s;ugge&s;tions and ob&s;ervations, pre&s;ent an antidote to the poi&s;on, with which the pen of the noveli&s;t is too often fraught. The &s;tudy of hi&s;tory was pur&s;ued, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, &s;y&s;tematically: To the page of the hi&s;torian one hour every day was regularly devoted; a &s;econd hour, Mary conver&s;ed with her adopted daughter upon the &s;ubject which a uniform cour&s;e of reading had fur|ni&s;hed; and a third hour Margaretta was directed to employ, in committing to paper &s;uch particular facts, remarks and con&s;equences deduced therefrom, as had,
<PB N="71" REF="034162_0070_0FFC5CD77014DA68">
during the hours appropriated to reading, and con|ver&s;ing, mo&s;t &s;trikingly impre&s;&s;ed her mind; and by the&s;e means the leading features of hi&s;tory were inde|libly imprinted thereon. Mrs. Vigillius al&s;o compo&s;|ed little geographical, hi&s;torical, and chronological catechi&s;ms, or dialogues, the nature of which will be ea&s;ily conceived; and &s;he pronounced them of infinite advantage in the pro&s;ecution of her plan; &s;he &s;ub|mitted likewi&s;e, at lea&s;t once every week, to little voluntary ab&s;ences, when my boy Plato, being con&s;ti|tuted courier betwixt the apartments of my wife and daughter, an epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence was carried on between them, from which more than one impor|tant benefit was derived; the penman&s;hip of our charge was improved; the beautiful and elegant art of letter writing was by degrees acquired; and Mar|garetta was early accu&s;tomed to lay open her heart to her maternal friend.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons when holding the pen, generally expre&s;s them&s;elves more freely than when engaged in conver|&s;ation; and if they have a perfect confidence in tho&s;e whom they addre&s;s, the probability is, that, unbo&s;om|ing them&s;elves, they will not fail to unveil the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of their &s;ouls&mdash;thus was Margaretta properly and happily habituated to di&s;clo&s;e, without a blu&s;h, each ri&s;ing thought to her, on whom the care of pre|paring her for the great career of life had devolved.</P>
<P>No, Mr. Pedant, &s;he was not unfitted for her prop|er &s;phere; and your &s;tomach, however critical it may be, never dige&s;ted finer puddings than tho&s;e which I, with an uncommon ze&s;t, have partook, as knowing they were the compo&s;ition of her fair hand&mdash;yes, in the receipts of cookery &s;he is thorough|ly ver&s;ed; &s;he is in every re&s;pect the complete hou&s;e|wife; and our linen never received &s;o fine a glo&s;s as when it was ironed and laid in order by Margaretta. Mrs. Vigillius was early taught the &s;cience of economy, and &s;he took care to teach it to her daughter; and being more e&s;pecially economical of time, &s;he &s;o ar|rangeth matters as never to appear embarra&s;&s;ed, or in
<PB N="72" REF="034162_0071_0FFC5CD5DFBBB7E0">
a hurry, having always her hours of lei&s;ure, which &s;he appropriates to the contingencies of the day. It is true, &s;he does not often engage in vi&s;its of mere cer|emony, &s;eldom making one of any party, without &s;ome view either to her own emolument, or that of tho&s;e about her; and with regard to dre&s;s, &s;he &s;pends but little time in a&s;&s;orting an article which is, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, too generally a monopolizer of a ble&s;&s;ing, that can hardly be too highly e&s;timated. She doth not think it nece&s;&s;ary to have her di&s;habille for the morning, her robe-de-chambre for noon, and her full trimed polanee or trollopee, for the evening. The morning generally, except in ca&s;es of any particular emergency, pre&s;ents her dre&s;&s;ed for the day; and as &s;he is always elegant, of cour&s;e &s;he can never be pre|po&s;terous, extravagant or gaudy. It will be hardly nece&s;&s;ary to add, that Mi&s;s Melworth was, and is, her exact copie&s;t; and indeed &s;he is &s;o warmly attached to my dear Mary, that I verily believe it would have been in her power to have initiated her into the devi|ous paths of error; and this is &s;aying a great deal of a mind which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth &s;uch innate goodne&s;s, as doth that which inhabits the gentle bo&s;om of my Mar|garetta. Upon the &s;ubject of dre&s;s, I am naturally reminded of the reque&s;t of my fanciful corre&s;pondent Monimia Ca&s;talio, relative to the dre&s;s of Margaretta, and particularly the height of her head; and I am happy that I can gratify Mi&s;s Monimia Ca&s;talio, by rec|ollecting a circum&s;tance, which being in point, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the general &s;tyle of Margaret|ta's dre&s;s. I think &s;he was about fifteen, when Mrs. Vigillius conforming as much as her ideas of propriety would admit, to the then fa&s;hion of the times, made for her a hat of white &s;atin. I remember there was a prettily fancied ribbon to it; and it had, I thought, rather a jauntee appearance. Margaretta put it on, and &s;allied forth to pay a vi&s;it to an acquaintance, a Mi&s;s Preedy; and the next morning, when &s;eated at the breakfa&s;t table, with much he&s;itation &s;he reque&s;t|ed her mamma to purcha&s;e for her, as an additional
<PB N="73" REF="034162_0072_0FFC5CD32B4600C0">
ornament to her hat, &s;ome beautiful feathers, which &s;he &s;aid were to be di&s;po&s;ed of at the very next &s;hop. Mrs. Vigillius, with great calmne&s;s, replied, "Yes, my dear, without doubt I can obtain for you the feathers; but I have for &s;ome time been endeavouring to accumulate a &s;um, which I had intended to ap|propriate for the completion of your little library; and a crown laid out in feathers, will take therefrom at lea&s;t one hand&s;ome and in&s;tructive volume; it is true, I have &s;ome money now by me, de&s;igned for another u&s;e&mdash;Poor Mrs. Lovemore, over who&s;e mis|fortunes you have &s;hed &s;o many tears, &s;till &s;wells the &s;igh of &s;orrow&mdash;he, who&s;e pre&s;ence would turn her little cottage into a palace, yet remains impri&s;oned! I have long had it in contemplation to dry the tear of angui&s;h from the cheek of that &s;olitary mourner; and I have anticipated the plea&s;ure I &s;hould experi|ence while witne&s;&s;ing the mantling joy, and the dimp|ling &s;miles, which would, upon an occa&s;ion &s;o happy, pervade the faces of the little beings who owe to her their exi&s;tence&mdash;Genius of &s;en&s;ibility! how extatic would be my emotions, could I be made in&s;trumental in re&s;tering to their embraces the hu&s;band and the father! The &s;um for which Mr. Lovemore is held in durance, is &s;mall, and his misfortunes could not by human prudence be either fore&s;een or prevented. From the late expenditures in our family, I have &s;o far economized, as to have at length made up the requi&s;ite &s;um; and I had thought to have taken a walk this fine morning, in order to liberate the poor man&mdash;but you want the feathers, and Lovemore mu&s;t con|tinue in captivity until I can lay by another crown."</P>
<P>Never &s;hall I forget the expre&s;&s;ion, the animated expre&s;&s;ion, which lighted up the countenance of Mar|garetta; tears of mingling plea&s;ure and delicate ap|prehen&s;ion, were upon her cheek; with a kind of du|teous eagerne&s;s, &s;he &s;eized the hand of Mary, and in a mo&s;t graceful manner bowing thereon, with a trem|ulous voice &s;he thus que&s;tioned&mdash;thus entreated&mdash;"And will the &s;orrows of the poor Mrs. Lovemore
<PB N="74" REF="034162_0073_0FFC5CCE7853CCC0">
know an end? O friend, patrone&s;s, protectre&s;s, pre|&s;erver, mother&mdash;what &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;Already my obli|gations to you are infinite&mdash;but tell me, dear lady, will you &s;till add thereto&mdash;&s;hall I accompany you to the abode of Mrs. Lovemore? I know that you will con&s;ent&mdash;let us go this in&s;tant&mdash;I will fly for your cloak, and we will not delay a moment."</P>
<P>It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to add that Margaretta obtain|ed her &s;uit, and I &s;ubjoin a declaration, that the&s;e kind of feathers are the mo&s;t beautiful, and the highe&s;t plum|ed, of any &s;he hath ever yet worn in her hat or cap.</P>
<P>But while we have been a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed in cul|tivating the mind of Margaretta, we have been endeav|ouring to eradicate the &s;eeds of that over-weening &s;elf conceit, which, while it would induce an o&s;tentatious exhibition of tho&s;e talents natural, or adventitious, which &s;he may po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;like a rampant weed would im|pede and over&s;hadow the growth of every virtue. Again&s;t pride and affectation we have been careful to guard her, by con&s;tantly inculcating one grand truth; a truth, to the conviction of which every ingenuous mind mu&s;t be ever open. Her per&s;on, the &s;ymmetry of her features, the ro&s;e and lily of her complexion, the <HI>tout en&s;emble</HI> of her exterior, the harmony of her voice, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;the&s;e are the endowments of nature&mdash;while the artificial accompli&s;hments with which &s;he is inve&s;t|ed, re&s;ulting wholly from accident, and being alto|gether independent of her own arrangements, confer upon her no real or intrin&s;ic merit.</P>
<P>We are daily a&s;&s;uring her, that every thing in future depends upon her own exertions, and that her character mu&s;t be de&s;ignated by that con&s;i&s;tent decency, that ele|gant propriety, and that dignified conde&s;cen&s;ion, which are indeed truly e&s;timable. We have apprized her, that in every &s;tage of her journey through life, &s;he will find friends&mdash;or a &s;ocial intercour&s;e with the circles in which &s;he may be called to move&mdash;con&s;tituting one of her principal enjoyments, and that if &s;he is not eager for admiration, if &s;he avoids making a di&s;play of &s;uperior abilities, &s;he will e&s;cape tho&s;e &s;hafts of envy which
<PB N="75" REF="034162_0074_0FFC5CCCF1D896F0">
will otherwi&s;e be too &s;urely aimed at her peace; and &s;ecure to her&s;elf the complacent feelings of tho&s;e with whom &s;he may be conver&s;ant.</P>
<P>Margaretta hath a becoming &s;pirit, and di&s;&s;imula|tion is a &s;tranger to her heart; &s;he is rather cheerful than gay; &s;he never diverts her&s;elf with &s;implicity and ignorance; <HI>double entendres</HI> &s;he dete&s;ts; &s;he is not an adept in the pre&s;ent fa&s;hionable mode of play|ing upon words, and &s;he never de&s;cends to what is call|ed je&s;ting; &s;he can deliver her&s;elf upon any &s;ubject, on which &s;he ventures to &s;peak, with great ea&s;e; but in large or mixed companies &s;he engages in conver&s;a|tion with manife&s;t reluctance; and I have heard her declare, that &s;he hath frequently, when encircled by &s;trangers, felt alarmed at the &s;ound of her own voice; &s;he never comments upon tho&s;e blunders which are the re&s;ult of a neglected education, nor will &s;he lend her &s;miles to tho&s;e who are thus employed; and &s;he ob&s;erves, that &s;uch kind of peccadillos have upon her no other ef|fect, than to excite in her bo&s;om the &s;en&s;ation of gratitude</P>
<P>With the laws of cu&s;tom, or fa&s;hion, &s;he is thorough|ly acquainted, and &s;he con&s;ents to follow them as far as they &s;quare with the dictates of rectitude; but &s;he never &s;acrifices to their documents either her humani|ty, or her convenience; &s;he regards, as extremely venial, an ignorance of their de&s;potic in&s;titutions; (indeed the multifarious requirements of mere ceremony, &s;trike her in &s;o trifling a point of view, that &s;he conceives it rather a matter of cour&s;e that they &s;hould &s;ometimes be omit|ted) and &s;he prefers plain manners to all the glitter of a &s;tudied or laboured addre&s;s.</P>
<P>But it is again&s;t the unaccountable freaks of the ca|pricious, that all the artillery of that humour, of which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a natural fund, is levelled; frank and inge|nuous her&s;elf, &s;he laughs at the vagaries of the whim&s;i|cal, and her heart is ever upon her lips; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he reflects much, and her judgment is fa&s;hioned by rea&s;on; &s;he cannot be &s;een without plea&s;ure, nor heard without in&s;truction.</P>
<P>But I am rather de&s;cribing what Margaretta <HI>is,</HI> than what &s;he <HI>was,</HI> at the period of her hi&s;tory
<PB N="76" REF="034162_0075_0FFC5CCB6DE3F878">
to which we are arrived. Three or four years have matured her talents, pre&s;enting the daily improv|ing and promi&s;ing girl, a truly lovely and accom|pli&s;hed woman, abundantly an&s;wering the fonde&s;t ex|pectations which were formed of her.</P>
<P>When our beloved charge had completed her &s;ix|teenth year, we conceived it full time to introduce her an intere&s;ting and beautiful object to a world, of who&s;e deceptions we had been careful to warn her, and for who&s;e intercour&s;e, we flattered our&s;elves, &s;he was as well qualified as girls at her age generally are.</P>
<P>It was at this period that Mrs. Vigillius, in compli|ance with the pre&s;&s;ing entreaties of a friend in whom &s;he entirely confided, reluctantly con&s;ented that Mi&s;s Melworth &s;hould pa&s;s a few weeks in the city of New-Haven.</P>
<P>But it may be proper to refer the opening of a new, and important &s;cene, to a &s;eparate e&s;&s;ay; and we &s;hall proceed to bring forward the appropriate number, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>

Well, but my mamma hath taught me not to dwell upon the dark &s;ide of events; and finding an adherence to her pre|cepts my &s;ure&s;t path, I wave every thing of a mel|ancholy nature, and proceed to &s;ay&mdash;that Mrs. Wor|thington received me with much affection; that &s;he treats me in all re&s;pects with the &s;ame tender atten|tion which &s;he be&s;tows upon her own daughter, Mi&s;s Amelia; and that I do not believe, if I except my own dear mamma, that there is in the whole world a better woman. Col. Worthington, as we were told, is at pre&s;ent ab&s;ent from home; &s;o that, excepting the do|me&s;tics, who are decent and obliging people, our family con&s;i&s;ts only of Mrs. Worthington, Mi&s;s Ame|lia, and my&s;elf. I am delighted with New-Haven, with its beautiful plains, its high &s;urrounding mountains, its neat built hou&s;es, its ample &s;treets, and the tall trees by which on either hand they are &s;haded. Yale Col|lege, an epi&s;copalian church, and three di&s;&s;enting meeting hou&s;es, are &s;ituated contiguous to each other. You know, my mamma, you directed me to write as if you were a &s;tranger to every particular. As I walk|ed over the green, the neighbourhood of the&s;e build|ings &s;eemed to con&s;ecrate the &s;pot, rendering it, as it were, hallowed ground. Yale College is not near to &s;pacious as the de&s;cription which we received from Edward Hamilton of the &s;eminary in which he was educated; indeed, ever &s;ince the evening upon which Edward entertained us &s;o agreeably with an account of Harvard College, I have had a very &s;trong inclina|tion to behold tho&s;e venerable domes. Many &s;tudents, however, pro&s;ecute their &s;tudies here; and I cannot but e&s;teem every young creature happy who hath the di&s;po&s;ition, and is pre&s;ented with the opportunity, of acquiring knowledge. As I have been introduced by Mrs. Worthington as the adopted daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Vigillius, and as the characters of my dear parental friends are &s;o properly revered here, I have
<PB N="78" REF="034162_0077_0FFC5CC2F8123F80">
received the mo&s;t marked attentions. If I might be allowed to give an opinion, I would &s;ay that the gen|tlemen of New-Haven appear to me to be friendly, and ho&s;pitable, and that the ladies are truly polite. Per|haps I may be permitted to pronounce, that tho&s;e whom I have &s;een, an&s;wer very exactly to the idea of genuine urbanity, which you, Madam, have taught me to form. Among the many who have mo&s;t obliging|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed me, the limits of a letter will only al|low me to mention Mrs. Edwards. Mr. Edwards, you will recollect, Madam, is an eminent barri&s;ter; and the per&s;on who is permitted to mingle in their &s;ocial circles, cannot but enjoy a &s;atisfaction of a &s;uperior kind.</P>
<P>The ladies of New-Haven are remarkably fond of cultivating flowers; and a di&s;qui&s;ition upon the beau|ties of the parterre makes a part in almo&s;t every con|ver&s;ation. Mrs. Edwards counted in her garden at one time, no le&s;s than eight hundred tulips all in full blow, among which the various &s;treaks and &s;hades were innumerable. Doubtle&s;s I could be very happy in New-Haven, if it was the re&s;idence of my papa and mamma, but were it the paradi&s;e of the globe, I &s;hould &s;igh for the village of their abode; and the elegant &s;aloon which my mamma devotes to &s;entimental friend|&s;hip, the &s;ocial breakfa&s;ting parlour, the ample dining room, the chamber, of which with &s;uch unexampled goodne&s;s I was con&s;tituted &s;ole proprietor, the &s;weet little flower garden, the &s;mooth gravel walk termina|ted by the woodbine alcove, &amp;c. &amp;c. the&s;e would all live in my idea as the haunts of perfect happine&s;s. Mrs. Worthington in&s;i&s;ts on my tarrying here until the expiration of the Commencement holidays; but in truth, I am well plea&s;ed that my leave of ab&s;ence ex|tendeth not near &s;o far; and I am glad that my mam|ma hath fixed preci&s;ely the time of my return; for I always feel a&s;&s;ured and tranquil when I am entirely under her direction. You will plea&s;e to a&s;&s;ure all my young acquaintance, particularly Serafina and Ed|ward Hamilton, that they are often pre&s;ent to my imagination; that in my dreams I &s;till mix in their
<PB N="79" REF="034162_0078_0FFC5CC04E314148">
little parties; and that it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould cea&s;e to remember them, or to love them very &s;incerely.</P>
<P>Well, I have written more than two pages, and yet have not executed the purpo&s;e I formed when I &s;at me down to this employ: You have accu&s;tomed me, deare&s;t lady, to unbo&s;om my&s;elf to you, and though this is my fir&s;t &s;eparation from you, yet the epi&s;tolary corre&s;pond|ence, with which I have for &s;uch a length of time, though continued under your roof, been indulged, hath given me the habit of expre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to you in this way, with the utmo&s;t freedom; and as a proof that I will never wear di&s;gui&s;es, when addre&s;&s;ing her who&s;e care hath rendered life to me a valuable gift, I will confe&s;s that I make the following communication with more reluctance than I ever yet, upon any occa&s;ion, experienced; but truth &s;hall be my motto, and to my loved patrone&s;s I will have no re&s;erves. I had been but one hour in the family of Mrs. Worthington, when a young gentleman, Mr. Sini&s;terus Courtland, made his appearance in that lady's drawing room; he enter|ed with the air of an e&s;tabli&s;hed acquaintance, and in|deed he &s;tands high in the e&s;teem of Mrs. Worthing|ton; a large party was collected, all of whom he ad|dre&s;&s;ed in a manner truly engaging, and upon my be|ing introduced, payed me a compliment in a &s;tyle &s;o new, &s;o elevated, and &s;o &s;trikingly plea&s;ing, that my heart in&s;tantaneou&s;ly acknowledged an involuntary prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour; &s;en&s;ations with which I was till that moment unacquainted, pervaded my bo|&s;om; I felt my face in a glow, and a plea&s;ing kind of perturbation took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my faculties. My op|portunities of &s;eeing Mr. Courtland have been &s;ince frequent. Three days afterwards he declared him&s;elf my lover; his a&s;&s;iduities are unwearied; he profe&s;&s;es to live but in my pre&s;ence, and he prote&s;ts that my re|jection of him will make him the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men. Mrs. Worthington a&s;&s;ures me, that Mr. Court|land is a gentleman who&s;e addre&s;&s;es no lady need blu&s;h to receive; and I will own to you, Madam, that if a few years more had pa&s;&s;ed ever my head, as you have

taught me to conceive a union with a man of worth may rationally be the ultimatum of a woman's wi&s;hes; I &s;hould think I &s;tood a greater chance for happine&s;s with this gentleman, than with any other in|dividual of his &s;ex.</P>
<P>Mr. Courtland is a native of V&mdash;in the State of&mdash;he &s;ays he had formerly the honour of an acquaintance with my papa. He is tall and well made, his addre&s;s is ea&s;y, and commanding; the contour of his face is &s;trikingly agreeable; indeed, his whole exteriour is a combination of elegance and dignity, and his manners are confe&s;&s;edly de&s;criptive of the fini&s;hed gentleman. I am told that he adds to the&s;e &s;uperficial accompli&s;h|ments a &s;ub&s;tantial and cultivated under&s;tanding; that he is a man of erudition, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth al&s;o, with a gen|eral knowledge of books, an exten&s;ive acquaintance with the world. On my return, he will pre&s;ent him|&s;elf before my parental friends. Perhaps they may not approve a connexion &s;o di&s;proportioned in regard to years, Mr. Courtland having numbered full thirty, and I but little better than &s;ixteen. I confe&s;s that I feel a degree of culpability while detecting my heart, thus audaciou&s;ly leaning toward an election, until my honoured benefactors, pointing the finger, had united|ly pronounced, "There, Margaretta, there is your con|genial &s;oul; behold the per&s;on whom we direct you to regard, as him who is de&s;tined the a&s;&s;ociate of your future life;" but my fault is altogether involuntary, and I pray you, my dear lady, to pre&s;ent to my papa my re&s;pectful regards; and to a&s;&s;ure him that from his honoured lips, and tho&s;e of my mamma, mu&s;t proceed the award which will decide the fate of their ever du|teous, ever grateful, ever affectionate</P>

<P>This letter, I &s;ay, inflicted upon my bo&s;om the mo&s;t pungent anxiety. Full well I knew Sini&s;terus Courtland. I knew him much better (for my per&s;onal interviews with him had been but few) than he was apprized of; I knew him to be ba&s;e, de&s;igning, and however incon|gruous

the&s;e qualities may &s;eem, improvident al&s;o; his father had bred him a gentleman, leaving him on|ly a &s;lender patrimony to &s;upport his preten&s;ions, while he was wholly de&s;titute of the means, di&s;po&s;ition, or talents, to add thereto; nay, even his &s;mall inheritance, without &s;pending a &s;ingle thought on the future, he had deeply involved, until pre&s;&s;ed upon by his creditors, he was finally induced to an effort to extricate him|&s;elf, by the very <HI>honourable method</HI> of deluding &s;ome wo|man who&s;e expectations were tolerable, into an affair of the heart, the matrimonial termination of which, he con&s;idered as an axiom, which was too irrefragable to admit of doubt; he had &s;pent the morning of his life in fluttering from town to town, paying his devoirs to every incon&s;iderate girl, who, allured by his flattery, and charmed by an exteriour which is indeed unex|ceptionable, and deceived al&s;o by the ea&s;e, brilliancy, and eclat of his appearance into a good opinion of his finances, became the dupe of her own vanity, finding her inclinations betrayed, in favour of an impo&s;tor, who on his part, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not depth of under&s;tanding &s;ufficient to render him capable of a &s;erious or la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to add a fini&s;hing to the character that now pre&s;ented a formidable candi|date for the heart of my girl; and, in addition to the unfavourable light in which I beheld Mr. Courtland, I had long entertained other views for Mar|garetta, adju&s;ting my plans in &s;uch a manner, as I conceived well nigh precluded a di&s;appointment: I was &s;en&s;ible, that as I had no near relation of my own, it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed Mi&s;s Melworth would be my heir, and I &s;huddered at the idea of the little fortune which, with much indu&s;try, application and economy, I had accumulated, being &s;quandered by a &s;pendthrift, while my daughter, and her de&s;cendants, were left pennyle&s;s! For a moment, regarding my&s;elf as a &s;hip|wrecked voyager, bereaved of every hope, I was ready, yielding the point, to &s;tretch my&s;elf upon the barren heaths of de&s;pair; but after deliberating the matter, I conceived, that though my fabric tottered, it was not

<P>I PERSUADE my&s;elf, my dear Margaretta, that it would at this time be wholly &s;uperfluous to expre&s;s to you the very high &s;atisfaction which both your father and my&s;elf mutually experience, at that unfeigned complacency in your &s;ituation, which you take every opportunity &s;o gratefully to avow. Once for all, my dear girl, you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf that your affection|ate regards are abundantly reciprocated; that we have no idea of a warmer attachment than we have con|ceived for you; and, that if the hearts of natural parents beat with ardours &s;tronger than tho&s;e which expand our bo&s;oms, they mu&s;t border &s;o nearly upon angui&s;h, that we are not ambitious of being able, experimentally to a&s;certain the difference; neither &s;hall I, at this time, expatiate upon the merit of your letter&mdash;my opinion of your epi&s;tolary talents, you already know, though per|haps I &s;hould not &s;o ea&s;ily deny my&s;elf a repetition of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e fond expre&s;&s;ions of admiration, to which I am ac|cu&s;tomed, and which, po&s;&s;ibly, in &s;ome degree originate in the predilection which my maternal feelings hath in|duced&mdash;were it not that the important communication you have forwarded to us, ab&s;orbs in my &s;oul every con&s;ideration of le&s;s weight.</P>

I hardly know where to begin, or how to ex|pre&s;s to you the anxiety to which you have given birth in our bo&s;oms. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that my Marga|retta can <HI>love</HI> where &s;he cannot <HI>entirely e&s;teem!</HI> and can &s;he have &s;o far forgot the le&s;&s;ons of her youth, as <HI>entirely to e&s;teem</HI> Mr. Courtland! What is the conduct of a man of honour in &s;o delicate a conjuncture as you delineate? doth he wait till he hath, as he &s;uppo&s;es, irrevocably fixed him&s;elf in the heart of a young woman, before he deigns to apprize tho&s;e who&s;e nights and days have been &s;pent in watching for her welfare? Certainly not&mdash;but immediately after his propo&s;als have been made to her, who I grant is the per&s;on principally concerned, if he can di&s;cern the &s;malle&s;t appearance of &s;ucce&s;s, (and men are eagle eyed upon the&s;e occa&s;ions) he will &s;olicit the &s;anction of her guardian friends, that he may either avail him&s;elf of them as auxiliaries in his pur&s;uit; or, if nece&s;&s;ary, &s;et about conquering a pa&s;&s;ion which cannot be con&s;ecrated by duty&mdash;rever&s;e the picture, and the man of duplicity &s;tands confe&s;t; he will &s;teal into the confidence of the un&s;u&s;pecting virgin, obtaining what he conceives an unalterable and undi|vided a&s;cendency over her mind, and then, <HI>merely as a compliment,</HI> the parents are made acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s, who, if they pre&s;ume to enter their caveat, however improper the connexion may in fact be, are accu&s;ed of tyranny, barbarity, and what not.</P>
<P>Thus Mr. Courtland&mdash;the po&s;t pa&s;&s;es by our door, but he hath not conde&s;cended to pen for us a &s;ingle line, which might inform us of his enterprize. Doubtle&s;s his intention is to a&s;&s;ail your pa&s;&s;ions during the whole period of your purpo&s;ed vi&s;it, when deeming the matter irremediable, he will make us a genteel bow, and <HI>in&s;ult</HI> us by reque&s;ting our advice! But from you, my dear child, we expect a deci&s;ion more upright&mdash;you have deviated, it is true, but you have as yet taken but one &s;tep, and we doubt not that you will very &s;peedily re|cover the path of di&s;cretion.

<P>A&s;k your&s;elf, my dear, what opportunity have you had of becoming acquainted with the views, hab|its, or temper of Mr. Courtland; and yet, although, when your letter was written, only <HI>ten days</HI> from the moment of your introduction to him had elap&s;ed, you <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly pronounced him the individual, who of all his &s;ex is the mo&s;t capable of making you happy!</HI> Such is the natural good &s;en&s;e of my Margaretta, that I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf I need not comment upon this declaration.</P>
<P>I am rather &s;urpri&s;ed at the part which my friend Mrs. Worthington hath taken in this affair; &s;urely, in this in&s;tance, &s;he hath been mi&s;led by the goodne&s;s of her own heart. Mr. Courtland is only a vi&s;itor in New-Haven; the place of his nativity and u&s;ual re&s;i|dence is at a great di&s;tance; and &s;he can only know in general that he is a man of family and education. But in truth, I my&s;elf have been wrong; I ought not to have parted with my Margaretta. Yet, while I palli|ate my fault, by a declaration that I conceived her extreme youth would have protected her from over|tures &s;o important; I tru&s;t, that the tears which I have &s;hed upon this occa&s;ion, will expiate it.</P>
<P>Yes, my love, your father knows Mr. Courtland&mdash;<HI>he knows him well;</HI> and without further inve&s;tigating the character of that gentleman, he bids me tell you, that he hath long entertained views of e&s;tabli&s;hing you

in our own neighbourhood. Edward Hamilton&mdash;&s;tart not, my dear, at a name, which in the innocence of your heart you have a thou&s;and times declared you loved&mdash;hath now completed his nineteenth year; he bids fair to be every thing which a fond father could wi&s;h for the man, to whom he yielded the beloved daughter of his affections; his character is bottomed upon integrity; he is every way accompli&s;hed; his pro&s;pects are good; his knowledge of the profe&s;&s;ion of his election, indeed his exten&s;ive acquaintance with mercantile affairs, is, for his years, prodigious; with regard to his exteriour and addre&s;s, if we allow for the charm of novelty, he might rival even a Courtland; and I declare I know not the youth who can equal him for gentility of mein, and beauty of per&s;on. But the&s;e are attractions, &s;im|ply con&s;idered, to which the heart of my Margaretta, when &s;he &s;uffers her&s;elf calmly to reflect, will, I am per|&s;uaded, ever remain impregnable. Before the death of your reverend friend, old Mr. Hamilton, the plan of uniting our children, &s;uppo&s;ing their hearts were not reluctant, was adju&s;ted. The good gentleman re|garded his &s;on as almo&s;t an affianced lover; otherwi&s;e I imagine he would not have left his ward, the beau|tiful and accompli&s;hed Serafina, &s;ituated as &s;he is in regard to Edward; who, however unblemi&s;hed his character may be, is neverthele&s;s, as a young man, a very ill-judged guardian for a young and unconnected woman. Hitherto, being de&s;irous of leaving you wholly unre&s;trained, we have kept our &s;ecret clo&s;e locked in our own bo&s;oms; and until the receipt of your letter, we have beheld with plea&s;ure the gradual advancement of our wi&s;hes. For Edward, he is wholly devoted to you, and while hardly con&s;cious of the mo|tives by which he is actuated, he is a&s;&s;iduous in every thing which relates to you; even trifles are inve&s;ted with importance, if they are in&s;cribed with your name&mdash;if you are unexpectedly mentioned, his whole frame is vi&s;ibly agitated, his complexion a&s;&s;umes a more ani|mated glow, his voice is mellowed into an unu&s;ual &s;oftne&s;s, and his tongue is never tired in rehear&s;ing

<P>Your intere&s;t and happine&s;s is the &s;ole motive of our actions; it is the pole &s;tar by which all our movements are directed, and if we can but &s;ee you plea&s;ingly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tranquillity, we &s;hall lay us down in perfect peace.

We have not yet di&s;clo&s;ed our|&s;elves to Edward; we are not in favour of early mar|riages; and though the laws of Heaven and of good citizen&s;hip, have ordained the &s;exes for each other, yet we think that years are requi&s;ite to ripen the judg|ment, and to a&s;certain the choice, which a young per|&s;on may have every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e immutably fixed. We have conceived, that a female who takes a &s;tep &s;o important, at the age of twenty three, or upwards, hath lo&s;t no time; and it was only in compliance with the dying reque&s;t of Mr. Hamilton, that we con&s;ented, &s;uppo&s;ing our young people &s;hould be propitious, that you &s;hould, at the period when you &s;hall have com|pleted your nineteenth year, exchange your vows with his de&s;erving &s;on.</P>

<P>IT will not be doubted but the urgency of my af|fairs, very &s;oon made my New-Haven expedition a matter of nece&s;&s;ity: nor will it, I pre&s;ume, be re|garded as problematical, that Mi&s;s Melworth, with duteous acquie&s;cence, became the companion of my return. But alas! that cheerfulne&s;s, which had &s;o long pre&s;ided in her bo&s;om, had taken its flight; and though joy gladdened in her countenance at the entrance of our village, and at the appearance of our habitation; though &s;he &s;eemed, while cla&s;ped in the arms of Mary, to be lo&s;t in extacy&mdash;yet, upon her lovely countenance the cloud again gathered; her eye beamed a melan|choly languor; the ro&s;e upon her cheek vi&s;ibly gave place to the lily of her complexion, and we were well nigh di&s;tracted by the gloomy forebodings which her altered figure originated in our &s;ouls. We had con|certed our plan, the ultimatum of which was her feli|city; and we were determined, if we could not bend her to our wi&s;hes, to follow her through all the vici&s;&s;i|tudes her unfortunate preference might involve, with every alleviation which we could furni&s;h. We con|templated the yielding her to the youth we loved, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> full and deliberate choice. Nothing &s;hort of this would &s;atisfy our affection, or re&s;tore to us the en|tire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that peace, which the late event had invaded; yet we abhorred con&s;traint, and we regard|ed per&s;ua&s;ion, con&s;idering the tender and conceding mildne&s;s of that heart which was almo&s;t in our hands, as no better than a &s;pecious kind of tyranny. But be|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in regard to the doctrine which extends the empire of <HI>genuine love, in my virtuous bo&s;om, beyond
<PB N="88" REF="034162_0087_0FFC5CA4C070FDC8">
the exi&s;tence or agency of e&s;teem,</HI> we doubted not, if we could era&s;e from the brea&s;t of our orphan, tho&s;e high ideas &s;he had conceived of the merit of her lover, the <HI>belle pa&s;&s;ion</HI> would very &s;peedily evaporate. Our bu&s;i|ne&s;s then being to convince the judgment, while we a&s;&s;ured our&s;elves, if this was po&s;&s;ible, the con&s;equences we wi&s;hed would inevitably follow, again&s;t a confi|dence which we conceived &s;o highly mi&s;placed, the whole force of our artillery was, of cour&s;e, levelled. Having, however, &s;o great a &s;take, it became us to de|liberate much, to be very cautious in our movements; a precipitate &s;tep might ruin our mea&s;ures, and it was our aim to be guarded at all points. Courtland very &s;oon made his appearance in our village, we extended to him the rights of ho&s;pitality; and, as an admirer of Mi&s;s Melworth's, we gave him every decent opportu|nity of advocating his cau&s;e. To this mode of proce|dure we were impelled by the following con&s;iderations: Should we refu&s;e, to this pretender, that uniform civil|ity, with which we have di&s;tingui&s;hed every &s;tranger, the wound thereby given to the feelings of Margaretta, might very po&s;&s;ibly add to the &s;trength of her attach|ment; and the idea of his &s;uffering upon her account, intere&s;ting her gratitude, would &s;till more have en|deared him to her; while, in the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of her &s;oul, accu&s;ing us of inju&s;tice, &s;he would &s;yllogi&s;tically have concluded, that error in one particular involved a po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;take in another. And it would, in truth, have been in a very high degree ab&s;urd, to have denied his claim to common attentions, merely becau&s;e he had eyes for the charms of a per&s;on, whom our partiality induced us to think, had merit &s;ufficient to captivate every beholder. In this arrangement we al&s;o made our&s;elves witne&s;&s;es of every movement, pre|cluding all nece&s;&s;ity for, and po&s;&s;ibility of, clande&s;tine views; and we conceived, be&s;ides, that as Mi&s;s Mel|worth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a penetration far beyond her years, frequent interviews with <HI>Sini&s;terus Courtland</HI> would in|fallibly develope to her under&s;tanding his true charac|ter, effectually de&s;troying that ma&s;k under which he
<PB N="89" REF="034162_0088_0FFC5C9FDC2F4560">
had continued to betray the unwary; and we well knew, that could <HI>&s;he her&s;elf</HI> make the di&s;covery we wi&s;hed, &s;uch an event would operate more propitiou&s;ly than any information, however important, which might be handed her from any other quarter. Perhaps it may be matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that being my&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of &s;uch material documents, I did not come to an immediate explanation, thus adju&s;ting the bu&s;ine&s;s agreeably to my own de&s;ignation. But though, as I apprehend, the preceding remark anticipates this ob|&s;ervation, I have yet to &s;ay, I was aware of the &s;ub|terfuges to which bad men often have recour&s;e: Had I declared my knowledge of what I termed Court|land's enormities, it would have been ea&s;y for him to have availed him&s;elf of the plea of youth and inexpe|rience, of a change of &s;y&s;tem, reformation, pre&s;ent regularity, &amp;c. &amp;c. and, for his poverty, it was an objection which the ardour of young affection would not only find a <HI>laudable genero&s;ity</HI> in palliating, but it would, with glowing zeal, a&s;&s;ay to enli&s;t again&s;t &s;o <HI>mercenary</HI> and <HI>unworthy</HI> a con&s;ideration, the mo&s;t vir|tuous propen&s;ities of the &s;oul. I knew that to era&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, made upon the youthful bo&s;om, violent efforts mu&s;t generally be inadequate; that they would much more frequently lacerate, than obliterate; and I was not willing to leave in the bo&s;om of Margaretta the &s;malle&s;t fear. I had not forgotten the integrity and the ingenuity which characterizes the morning of life; and I remembered al&s;o, that the enthu&s;ia&s;m of an early love, is fruitful in its vindications of the ob|ject of its preference; and that it is ready to accu&s;e every objector as prejudiced and unju&s;t. Taking the matter up in this view, we thought be&s;t to await &s;ome fortunate cri&s;is, holding the <HI>unque&s;tionable facts</HI> of which we were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, relative to Courtland, as our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;ource.</P>
<P>Mean time, we de&s;cended not to di&s;gui&s;es: Upon the application of that gentleman, we informed him of our prior engagement to young Hamilton's father&punc; of our wi&s;hes for the &s;ucce&s;s of the projected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="90" REF="034162_0089_0FFC5C9B78B10020">
of our determination to take every proper &s;tep, which we &s;hould deem likely to propitiate the mind of Mar|garetta, re&s;pecting an event which we regarded in &s;o eligible a view; and we grounded our objections to him on the di&s;parity of years, the &s;hort date of his ac|quaintance with Mi&s;s Melworth, and the di&s;tance of his re&s;idence; neverthele&s;s, we added, that if we had the power, even of natural parents, over the final de|ci&s;ion of that young lady, we &s;hould not hold our&s;elves authorized to direct her any further than rea&s;on point|ed; and that we left him at full liberty to pro&s;ecute his &s;uit with what advantage he might, only promi&s;|ing, that we &s;hould not con&s;ent to di&s;po&s;e of Mi&s;s. Melworth, even to Hamilton him&s;elf, until &s;he had com|pletely rounded her nineteenth year. Courtland, up|on this a&s;&s;urance, reddened exce&s;&s;ively; he had hoped <HI>his happine&s;s might have been much &s;ooner accelerated, and &s;ome very pre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances, relative to him, demanded a very early e&s;tabli&s;hment.</HI> Our determination upon this head continued, however, unalterable; while our e&s;|pou&s;ing, as we apparently did, the intere&s;ts of Hamil|ton, occa&s;ioned in the bo&s;om of our daughter &s;uch a &s;truggle between inclination and duty, as &s;till looked with a very &s;erious and unfriendly a&s;pect upon her health. Upon our grand &s;ubject, both Mary and my|&s;elf held with her many conver&s;ations, which, I am vain enough to imagine, might be u&s;eful to young per&s;ons thus circum&s;tanced, and which, did not the limits pre&s;cribed to a writer for the Magazine, &s;et bounds to my encroachments, &s;hould mo&s;t certainly be recounted; but &s;hould they be demanded, as they were immediately committed to paper, future Glean|ers &s;hall certainly record them. One &s;entiment, how|ever, which dropped from the mouth of Mary, which I accidentally overheard, and which was perfectly new to me, I cannot excu&s;e my&s;elf from giving. She was, one fine afternoon, while &s;eated with Margaretta in the arbour to which they were both &s;o much attached, endeavouring, in a manner peculiar to her&s;elf, to &s;ooth the feelings of her daughter; thus encouraging her to

lay open her whole &s;oul, that &s;he might, from &s;uch confidence, the better judge of the nature of the rem|edy &s;he was to apply; when Mi&s;s Melworth, &s;en&s;ibly regretting that &s;he was &s;o unfortunately &s;ituated, as to feel a di&s;po&s;ition to act contrary to the wi&s;hes of her be&s;t friends; by turns lamenting and accu&s;ing the treachery of a heart which had thus betrayed her, concluded a very tender harangue, by a declaration, that though Hamilton was every thing amiable, yet &s;he was certain &s;he could never feel for him that pref|erence which &s;he did for Courtland; &s;he could never regard him in any other view than that of a brother. "Will you, my &s;weet girl," replied Mary, "<HI>re-con&s;ider</HI> this affirmation? you are fond of rea&s;oning, you know; and tru&s;t me, my dear, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that an at|tachment which embraceth not rea&s;on as its auxiliary, is not worth cheri&s;hing. You own that Hamilton is every thing amiable; but you can only love him as a brother! you pretend not to point out a &s;ingle vir|tue, a &s;ingle accompli&s;hment, a &s;ingle grace, in which Courtland can claim a &s;uperiority over Hamilton; yet you can only love Hamilton as a brother, while you love Courtland as&mdash;as what, my dear? Will you, Margaretta, plea&s;e to point out the di&s;tinction between tho&s;e attachments which you feel for the one and the other? You blu&s;h, my love; let me ki&s;s off that con&s;cious tear&mdash;Say, my charming rea&s;oner, would the&s;e over nice di&s;tinctions, for which you cannot find a name, ever have found entrance into the bo&s;om of a virtuous girl, were it not for that fal&s;e ta&s;te which is formed by novel reading? What is this &s;omething which you feel for Courtland, and which you cannot feel for Hamilton? Certainly it is, at be&s;t, but the fever of the imagination, the delirium of fancy; and ever experienced votary of this <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> if under the direction of truth, will tell you, that the duration of the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">xi&s;m is extremely &s;hort, that the &s;ober and healthy age of rea&s;on awaits, when love and friend&s;hip wear the &s;ame face, when only &s;olid advantages can plea&s;e; and, they will add, that no well informed per|&s;on

would &s;acrifice to the illu&s;ion of a moment, the happine&s;s of a life. Did you never, my dear, reflect upon the connexions which mu&s;t have been formed by the immediate de&s;cendants of the pair who were cre|ated in Paradi&s;e? brothers then interchanged the nup|tial vow with &s;i&s;ters; they were unacquainted with the refinements of modern times; the virtues which en|deared the brother, rendered the hu&s;band amiable; and we have no authority for &s;uppo&s;ing, that their matri|monial felicity was more circum&s;cribed than that of their po&s;terity. It is true, that the multiplication of our &s;pecies have rendered other regulations, relative to the marriage contract, or the parties contracting, both nece&s;&s;ary and proper; and it is undoubtedly true, that an ob&s;ervation of the&s;e regulations, is religiou&s;ly obli|gatory; but yet, in my opinion, the ab&s;urdity of hold|ing a character in great e&s;timation, and highly accom|pli&s;hed, as a brother, which we &s;hould at the &s;ame time regard with reluctance as a conjugal companion, is &s;till palpable; and I mu&s;t repeat, that the preva|lency of &s;uch romantic ideas can originate only in the regions of fancy." Thus far my hone&s;t woman. But Margaretta, in a letter to Mi&s;s Worthington, which lately came under my ob&s;ervation, hath be&s;t de&s;cribed her own &s;en&s;ations; I &s;ubjoin it therefore, <HI>verbatim,</HI> as it flowed from as &s;u&s;ceptible and upright a heart, as ever beat in the bo&s;om of humanity.</P>

<P>I AM, my dear Mi&s;s Worthington, highly plea&s;ed, that my account of my reception in&mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid, my native village&mdash;hath been productive to you, of even a momentary &s;atisfaction; and I do a&s;&s;ure you that I am not a little elated, when I am told, your honoured mother pronounces my de&s;cription replete with &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful traits of nature: I know, that to her partiality and candour, I ought to impute much; but, by the commendation of &s;o re&s;pectable a judge, I am neverthele&s;s exhilarated, and I am almo&s;t induced to

think it allowable, to plume my&s;elf upon an award &s;o honorary. You will plea&s;e to offer to the dear lady my acknowledgments, accompanied by my mo&s;t re&s;|pectful regards.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me if I have recovered my tranquillity; alas, no! and I fear, my Amelia, that peace hath fled forever from my bo&s;om. Mr. Courtland, as you &s;up|po&s;e, is here; would I had never &s;een him&mdash;I might then have been happy. Edward Hamilton&mdash;the bloom hath for&s;aken his checks&mdash;the lu&s;tre of his fine eyes is no more&mdash;I never &s;aw &s;o total a change in a youth, who but lately might have figured as the per&s;onifica|tion of health, enlivened and informed by the mo&s;t endearing vivacity: Would I had never &s;een Court|land&mdash;I might then have been happy. When Edward Hamilton &s;uffers, I feel that I cannot &s;tand by regard|le&s;s; I follow him with the affection of a &s;i&s;ter; but of late, he &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;huns my advances: It was but ye&s;terday, that with trembling eagerne&s;s, he gra&s;ped my hand; &s;omething he was about to &s;ay; but, as if recollecting him&s;elf, in&s;tantly, like the &s;pectre of a dream. he fled away. And I not ju&s;tified in &s;ayings that if I had never &s;een Courtland, I might then have been happy? Serafina too, is often drowned in tears. Serafina is the &s;i&s;ter of my heart. Why will &s;he not exchange her vows with. Edward? how rich &s;hould I then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with &s;uch a brother&mdash;&s;uch a &s;i&s;ter. You a&s;k if Mr. Courtland is an approved lover&mdash;alas, no!&mdash;alas, yes!&mdash;You will be at no lo&s;s to explain this &s;eem|ing paradox. I &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pect that my guardian friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome &s;ecret, relative to Mr. Courtland, which they have not yet unfolded; for &s;urely they could not be &s;o &s;trongly oppo&s;ed, on account of inequality of years. The engagement en|tered into with old Mr. Hamilton was conditional; and you know, my dear, that though I am&mdash;though I <HI>was,</HI> I &s;hould &s;ay, cheerful, it never could be &s;aid that I was gay; and I think I could accommodate my|&s;elf to the grave&s;t humour: But my parents, you will &s;ay, are the be&s;t judges; and you, Mi&s;s Worthington,
<PB N="94" REF="034162_0093_0FFC5C8DBB595C00">
are a good girl, while I, methinks, am become a faulty, a very faulty creature. My mother&mdash;but my mother is an angel&mdash;I do a&s;&s;ure you, my dear, that I not &s;eldom feel a degree of awe, while contemplating the character of &s;o divine a woman, which ab&s;olutely deters me from arrogating to my&s;elf the title, with which her conde&s;cending indulgence hath inve&s;ted me. This &s;uperior woman, you will recollect, a&s;&s;ured me that I &s;hould never be the wife of Hamilton, except both my judgment, and my be&s;t affections were con|&s;enting; exactly with this declaration, doth every ar|rangement corre&s;pond; and, while neither &s;he nor my father produce a &s;ingle argument in favour of the man of their election, which rea&s;on doth not fully au|thorize, they unitedly and repeatedly engage, that however I may ultimately determine, they will nev|er cea&s;e to be my parental friends. Tell me, my dear, what returns doth &s;uch matchle&s;s genero&s;ity merit? And help me to di&s;charge as I ought, with becoming decency, a daughter's part. Unexampled indeed is their con&s;ideration for me; and &s;till the more to en|hance their goodne&s;s, and ally it to perfection, they a&s;&s;ay to wear a tranquillity which is foreign from their hearts; for alas! do I not hourly ob&s;erve the anxious &s;olicitude but too vi&s;ibly pourtrayed in the manly fea|tures of my father&mdash;often have I wiped the tear from the &s;woln eye of my mother&mdash;often have I witne&s;&s;ed the chagrin which they have mutually and involun|tarily manife&s;ted at any di&s;covery which I have un|warily made of my attachment to Courtland; and I have but too well marked the joy of their brightened countenances, at the &s;malle&s;t in&s;tance of my tenderne&s;s for Edward. What right do I po&s;&s;e&s;s thus to &s;tab the bo&s;oms which have &s;o long fo&s;tered me? Better I had been whelmed beneath tho&s;e waves which gave death to him from whom I derived my exi&s;tence, than thus to become the &s;ource of corroding anxiety, to characters &s;o exalted. Every pen&s;ive look of theirs pierces me to the &s;oul; and I &s;eem to move an evil genius, doomed to chace peace from their revered bo&s;oms. Amelia,

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THUS, for a con&s;iderable time, matters remained &s;tationary as it were, in my family. Courtland continued his pur&s;uit. In the bo&s;om of Margaretta, the conflict between duty and inclination was unyield|ingly &s;evere; and Hamilton, with a noble con&s;i&s;tency,
<PB N="97" REF="034162_0096_0FFC5C8AAC413940">
per&s;evered in declining a competition, which he deem|ed unworthy that rational, di&s;intere&s;ted and fervent attachment, which every faculty of his &s;oul had long acknowledged for Mi&s;s Melworth.</P>
<P>Courtland, evidently exulting in his &s;ucce&s;s, felici|tated him&s;elf upon his opening pro&s;pects; and calculat|ing upon the tenderne&s;s of Margaretta, he became con|fident it would be in his power to obtain a much ear|lier day, than the very di&s;tant era which we had &s;o peremptorily named.</P>
<P>We were thus circum&s;tanced, when the following little poem that made its appearance in the Gazette, however incon&s;iderable it may in fact be, from the important con&s;equences by which it was attended, mer|its a place in my narration.</P>

well known benevolence, her conde&s;cending affability to her inferiors, her complacently dignified deportment to her equals, and her veneration for all tho&s;e whom years had rendered her &s;uperiors&mdash;had &s;o well e&s;tab|li&s;hed her in the hearts of our connexions, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ender her an object generally beloved; and, indeed, the pro|priety and equality of her conduct had been &s;uch, as to produce a &s;oleci&s;m to the adage, which creates envy as the &s;hadow of merit; nor did we know that the pa&s;|&s;ion of malevolence was in exerci&s;e toward her. It was &s;oon noi&s;ed abroad that Margaretta had been eu|logized in the news paper, and it furni&s;hed a topic for tho&s;e circles in which &s;he moved; her partial favourers found beauties in the piece, which perhaps a critic would have been far from allowing it. They made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to find out the Author; they applied them&s;elves with much avidity to the pur&s;uit; and they determined, if they &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to &s;uc|ceed, to hail him as the prince of poets.</P>
<P>We had, among the number of our vi&s;itors, and old lady by the name of Clacket, who was al&s;o much at|tached to Mi&s;s Melworth, and who&s;e curio&s;ity was upon this occa&s;ion rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch. She roundly taxed Courtland with being the author of the poem; and the embarra&s;&s;ment which be di&s;covered, abun|dantly ju&s;tified her &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>The piece had, as I hinted, its admirers; and Court|land either &s;aw, or thought he &s;aw, an advantage in adopting this fugitive relation of the Parna&s;&s;ian la&s;&s;es: He managed the matter with &s;ome adroitne&s;s; his &s;er|vant was authorized to whi&s;per, as it profound &s;ecret to lady Clacket's maid, that his ma&s;ter had in truth compo&s;ed the favourite lines, which had originated to much &s;peculation; and &s;he reporting it in confidence to her lady, it was in a few days entru&s;ted to the taci|turnity of the whole neighbourhood. Courtland was repeatedly complimented upon his poetical abilities, and he he&s;itated not to wear the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ays.</P>
<P>It happened about this time that Courtland made one of a large circle which were collected round our
<PB N="100" REF="034162_0099_0FFC6302C3675E50">
&s;ocial board, when the before mentioned lady intro|duced the &s;ubject of the poem, and proceeded with all the loquacity of talkative volubility, to pronounce a panegyric upon our gentleman, as the author. The poet bowed, blu&s;hed, and looked &s;illy. Margaretta was evidently plea&s;ed; while I, regarding the whole affair, as another <HI>much ado about nothing,</HI> &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed it without further ob&s;ervation, had I not acci|dentally glanced the face of Serafina, who was al&s;o of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r' party, and who&s;e countenance, in the cour&s;e of a few moments, expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;ations. Her heightened complexion during the conver&s;ation, now changing to the cleare&s;t white, and now a&s;&s;uming the deepe&s;t colouring with which the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned feelings could tinge it. I marked Serafina, but I mark|ed her in &s;ilence; for, from the&s;e &s;u&s;picious appear|ances, I was induced to fear that the &s;pecious manners of our gallant, had made al&s;o upon the youthful mind of this young lady, an impre&s;&s;ion which would be with difficulty eradicated! But I was not &s;uffered to remain long under this deception; our company &s;oon &s;eparat|ed, and only Courtland, Margaretta, Serafina, Mary and my&s;elf, remained. The chagrin upon the face of Serafina was &s;till vi&s;ible, when, &s;tanding up with much dignity in her manner, &s;he in&s;tantly accounted for the appearance, by which I had been mi&s;led.</P>
<P>Addre&s;&s;ing Mr. Courtland, &s;he thus expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf: "I am, Sir, the friend of Edward Hamilton; we have been educated together, almo&s;t from the fir&s;t moment of our exi&s;tence, and every &s;ecret of his &s;oul is repo&s;ed in my bo&s;om. I am not &s;ure that he would approve of what I am about to &s;ay; nay, feeling my mind at this pre&s;ent in a great mea&s;ure governed by indigna|tion, I am not my&s;elf po&s;itive, that I am quite right; however, like all angry folks I am hurried on by an impetuo&s;ity which I find altogether irre&s;i&s;table. Is it not enough, Sir, that you have &s;upplanted that unhappy young man in his deare&s;t hopes? Is it not enough that you have &s;tepped between him and that hoard of feli|city which he fondly fancied was trea&s;ured up for him?
<PB N="101" REF="034162_0100_0FFA6523F38D9608">
but mu&s;t you al&s;o <HI>poorly &s;teal</HI> that pittance of fame, which ju&s;tice re&s;erved for him? You know, Sir, that you never wrote the piece for which you have been contented to receive the prai&s;es of &s;o many admirers. I have at this moment the original lines upon Mi&s;s Mel|worth, which were written by Edward, in my pocket|book; they were penned upon yonder verdant bank, during Mi&s;s Melworth's continuance at New-Haven, while I was prattling by his &s;ide. It is true he im|agines they are de&s;troyed; he reque&s;ted that I would de&s;troy them; but I have imprudently and unkindly given a copy of them to Mi&s;s Predy, and thus they have found their way to the pre&s;s."</P>
<P>What would I have then given for the pencil of a Hogarth, that I might have &s;ketched the group which my parlour at that in&s;tant exhibited. Need I tell thee, reader, that I am not even a de&s;cendant of Hogarth's? I trow not; but I add, by way of inform|ation, that having a mortal aver&s;ion to daubing, it is therefore that I pa&s;s ha&s;tily over every expre&s;&s;ive fea|ture, which was then replete with the deepe&s;t meaning, and only ob&s;erve, that Courtland, almo&s;t immediately recovering him&s;elf, &s;uddenly &s;eized the out&s;tretched hand of Mi&s;s Clifford, and pre&s;&s;ing it with much ad|dre&s;s to his lips, bur&s;t into an immoderate fit of laugh|ter, affecting great &s;urpri&s;e, that &s;he took the matter &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly, and declaring that he meant nothing more than a je&s;t, and merely to amu&s;e him&s;elf with the &s;im|plicity and credulity of lady Clacket.</P>
<P>For my own part, my a&s;toni&s;hment at the impu|dence of the fellow, ab&s;olutely &s;truck me dumb; and I &s;uffered him to give his adventure what turn he plea&s;|ed, without even the capability of interrupting him! I &s;aw, however, by the altered looks of Margaretta; by a degree of di&s;gu&s;t which pervaded her fine counte|nance, and the pointed reprehen&s;ion which &s;he darted from her charmingly expre&s;&s;ive eyes; from all the&s;e au&s;picious indications, I gathered, that the full time for executing my &s;cheme, was at length arrived, and that the mine being thus accidentally and advanta|geou&s;ly
<PB N="102" REF="034162_0101_0FFA6526A03E9F98">
&s;prung, it became me to continue my opera|tions with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>Courtland, therefore, had no &s;ooner taken his leave for the evening, than without taking the lea&s;t notice of the rhymes, or their effect, I ob&s;erved to my daughter&mdash;that having long noted with much concern her wa&s;ting frame, and impaired con&s;titution, I was at la&s;t come to the re&s;olution of bending my&s;elf entirely to her wi&s;hes; that upon the next morning's vi&s;it which we &s;hould receive from her lover, I would lead him imme|diately to my library&mdash;that po&s;&s;ibly I might have mi&s;|taken his character, but that I would then enter into a conver&s;ation with him, of a nature &s;o &s;erious, as fully to a&s;certain our man&mdash;that I would reque&s;t her, accom|panied by her mother, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat her&s;elf in the adjoining apartment, where they might be ear witne&s;&s;es of our di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;and that if, after the inve&s;tigation to which I &s;hould oblige Mr. Courtland to &s;ubmit, he &s;hould &s;till continue the object of a choice, which would then be &s;o deliberate, I would my&s;elf lead her to the altar, at any hour which &s;he &s;hould judge mo&s;t proper; and, furthermore, that I promi&s;ed on behalf of Mary, as well as in my own name, that we would continue through life, in every event, to partake her felicity, and to gild for her, to the utmo&s;t of our ability, every misfortune which might await her.</P>
<P>Margaretta trembled exce&s;&s;ively; her complexion now reddened to the deepe&s;t dye, and now changed to the mo&s;t deadly pale! we were fearful that &s;he would faint. Mary addre&s;&s;ed her in the mo&s;t &s;oothing language; this had the de&s;ired effect; and, bur&s;ting into tears, &s;he rai&s;ed her cla&s;ped hands, while a kind of agonized expre&s;&s;ion was depictured upon her coun|tenance, and, ere we were aware, with a &s;udden and tremulous emotion, quitting her &s;eat, &s;he &s;unk down upon her knees! &s;ore us. "Oh Sir, oh Madam!" in a broken voice &s;he exclaimed, "&s;pare your child, &s;pare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this trial; your conde&s;cen&s;ion is &s;ufficiently mani|fe&s;ted; never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore do I wi&s;h to behold the man who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this evening pa&s;&s;ed your doors; I am convinced
<PB N="103" REF="034162_0102_0FFC63004A796580">
that he is poorly mean, that he is capable of the mo&s;t deliberate ba&s;ene&s;s; and never &s;hall my &s;oul bind it&s;elf in alliance with an unworthy pretender, who can thus pitifully &s;toop to purloin the fame, with which un|doubted merit had inve&s;ted his &s;uperior."</P>
<P>"Nay, my love," rejoined Mary, "you are now again too precipitate; would you di&s;card the man of your heart, merely becau&s;e he is ambitious of adorning him|&s;elf with the poet's laurel? be&s;ides, the&s;e tears, the&s;e looks of angui&s;h, the&s;e broken accents, and heart-affect|ing &s;ighs; the&s;e all betray a mind not &s;ufficiently at ea&s;e, to make up a determination &s;o important; &s;hould you thus ha&s;tily proceed, you may po&s;&s;ibly repent at lei&s;ure. Come to my arms, my daughter&mdash;let me pre&s;s this throbbing heart to the bo&s;om of friend&s;hip; let us take time, my love; your father, who&s;e wi&s;dom not &s;eldom leads him through the labyrinth of the human heart, &s;hall pro&s;ecute his plan, while we, &s;um|moning the aid of mild re&s;ignation, abide, with patient acquie&s;cence, the event."</P>
<P>Thus, then, we adju&s;ted our mea&s;ures; and the returning &s;un, according to cu&s;tom, pre&s;enting Mr. Courtland, u&s;hered in an hour which I regarded among the mo&s;t important of my life. My unalterable intention was to con&s;titute Mi&s;s Melworth &s;ole heire&s;s of every &s;hilling which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; yet, regarding our &s;park, in pecuniary matters, as another <HI>Zeluco,</HI> I con|ceived my&s;elf ju&s;tified in practi&s;ing a little addre&s;s, in order to the unma&s;king an impo&s;tor, who, by meth|ods &s;o unwarrantable, had obtained &s;uch hold of the affections of my daughter.</P>
<P>Behold me then, gentle reader, with the&s;e impre&s;|&s;ions, &s;eated in my library, and Courtland, with <HI>un|blu&s;hing effrontery,</HI> lolling upon a &s;ofa before me; li&s;ten, al&s;o, while with a &s;olemn, but compo&s;ed coun|tenance, and in a re&s;olute and peremptory tone of voice, I thus deliver my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I have reque&s;ted this interview, Sir, in order to obtain your ear upon a very important &s;ubject. I ob|&s;erve that your preten&s;ions to Mi&s;s Melworth, notwith|&s;tanding

your knowledge of our predilection for Mr. Hamilton, are &s;till continued; and I repeat, that no parental friends, ought <HI>unduly</HI> to influence in an affair, which cannot &s;o deeply intere&s;t them, as the individuals who are principally concerned; we con&s;ent, therefore, &s;uppo&s;ing Mi&s;s Melworth's preference &s;hould remain, to yield you her hand, and we a&s;&s;ure you that her matrimonial choice &s;hall, in no &s;ort, influence her for|tunes." Here Courtland bowed exultingly, and I proceeded to &s;ay&mdash;"But, Sir, it is ju&s;t, that upon this occa&s;ion, I add, that, as Mi&s;s Melworth is not in fact, our daughter, &s;he is not by nature entitled to our inheritance. My heart, Sir, my paternal heart, ac|knowledges for that young lady the &s;tronge&s;t affection; but family claims are re&s;pectable, and the pride of re|lation&s;hip is &s;eldom wholly eradicated from the bo&s;om. There is now living in a certain metropolis upon this continent, a di&s;tant relation of mine, who bears my name; it is true he is rich, but his family is large, and as I am fond, I confe&s;s, of e&s;tabli&s;hing my name, the world, in general, will not condemn me, &s;hould I de|vi&s;e the greater part of my real e&s;tate to this my kin&s;|man; while prudence directs me to &s;ecure to Marga|retta and her po&s;terity, whatever part of my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions I &s;hall judge proper to endow her with; and I am po&s;itive that Mi&s;s Melworth will not accu&s;e me of want of affection for her, whatever arrangements I may be induced to make."</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ay not to de&s;cribe the agitated alterations, which the countenance of Courtland underwent, during the latter part of my harangue; anger, di&s;appointment, and the deepe&s;t chagrin, were marked there; when, &s;tarting from his &s;eat, with an indignation but ill con|cealed, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the following effect: <Q>I was informed, Sir, that you had no relation in ex|i&s;tence; I was informed that Mi&s;s Melworth would undoubtedly &s;ucceed to your e&s;tates; and I was moreover informed, that you had de&s;tined a very hand&s;ome &s;um, as a nuptial pre&s;ent, for the hu&s;band of that young lady, upon the day of marriage; if I
<PB N="105" REF="034162_0104_0FFC62FC136940E8">
am deceived, Sir, though I <HI>adore</HI> Mi&s;s Melworth, yet neither my fortune nor my family will admit of my union with a young lady, who, (excu&s;e me, Sir) doth not &s;eem to have <HI>any</HI> well grounded expectations, and who cannot claim a &s;ingle per&s;on in the world, as her natural relation.</Q></P>
<P>It was with difficulty that I &s;tifled my re&s;entment; but, a&s;&s;uming an air of calmne&s;s, I returned&mdash;"I am ignorant, Sir, who was your informant; but I am con|fident I have never before explained my&s;elf upon this &s;ubject, to any one, and I am not an&s;werable for the erroneous conjectures of the bu&s;y multitude: But, Sir, you, in your turn, mu&s;t excu&s;e me, when I &s;ay, that I &s;hould imagine a per&s;on upon the eve of bankruptcy, if he really loved the woman whom he was &s;eeking to affiance to penury, would be happy to find her inve&s;ted with a &s;hare of property, which being independent of his failure, would &s;et her above ab&s;olute want."</P>
<P>This was enough; it worked him up to a degree of frenzy; and, clenching his fi&s;t, with a menacing air, he approached my &s;eat.</P>
<P>"What, Sir, can you mean? What do you mean Mr. Vigillius? I demand an explanation."</P>
<P>"Compo&s;e your&s;elf, Sir," I rejoined, "I am not to be intimidated by tho&s;e big looks, or that air of haughty defiance. Had you, Mr. Courtland, when you pre|&s;ented your&s;elf in my family, as a candidate for the affection of my daughter, ingenuou&s;ly favoured me with a <HI>real</HI> &s;tatement of your affairs, I would have u&s;ed my intere&s;t to have adju&s;ted them amicably with your creditors; and had the attachment of Margaretta been permanent, while I regarded you as a worthy, though an unfortunate man, I &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding my conditional engagement with Mr. Hamilton, have viewed the matter with tolerable complacency: but, when you pa&s;s your&s;elf upon us as a man in affluent circum&s;tances, when you act, in every in&s;tance, the de|liberate deceiver, I &s;hould greatly grieve, did I not know that my daughter's eyes were already opened: She, even at this moment, regains her former tran|quillity.
<PB N="106" REF="034162_0105_0FFC62F9DC446F58">
You are no &s;tranger to me. Sir; your <HI>amours,</HI> your <HI>improvidence,</HI> the <HI>ruined &s;tate of your finances,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. I have this moment letters in my pocket, from your principal creditors, and I could long ere this have apprized Mi&s;s Melworth, had I not judged it ex|pedient that &s;he &s;hould make the di&s;covery for her&s;elf&mdash;&s;he hath made it, and I am again a happy man."</P>
<P>Courtland's cowardly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oul now &s;hrunk from my gaze; but a&s;&s;uming, with his wonted fine&s;&s;e, the air of an injured man, as he darted from the library, and from the hou&s;e, he &s;aid, <Q>It is well, Sir, it is well that your connexion with Mi&s;s Melworth is your protec|tion; otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not fail to call you to a very &s;evere account, for fal&s;ehoods and ab&s;urdities, which the bo&s;om of malevolence hath doubtle&s;s orignated.</Q></P>
<P>From the library, I immediately pa&s;&s;ed to the ad|joining apartment. Margaretta hid her blu&s;hing face in the bo&s;om of her mother: and while I pre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e beautiful females to my heart, I prote&s;ted, by the ten|derne&s;s which I bore them, that I was, at that in&s;tant, the happie&s;t of human beings.</P>
<P>Margaretta propo&s;ed a thou&s;and que&s;tions in a breath; and, while &s;he ble&s;&s;ed the hour of her emanci|pation, &s;he begged to learn the re&s;idence of the dear family I had mentioned, who, from their affinity to me, &s;he gratefully &s;aid, were already imaged in her heart, and to whom &s;he wi&s;hed &s;peedily to devote the page of tender acknowledgment, for the &s;hare they unde&s;ignedly had, in liberating a mind which had been &s;o unworthily en&s;laved. Tapping her cheek, I ex|pre&s;&s;ed my wonder that &s;he too had been deceived; for, my dear, I added, though there is actually, in the city of&mdash;, a gentleman of my name, circum&s;tanced exactly as I have &s;tated, yet I am not per&s;onally ac|quainted with him; nor do I know that there is the remote&s;t con&s;anguinity between us, in any other line, than as we are alike de&s;cended from the hone&s;t couple who had their re&s;idence in Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>In fact, not having, in my conver&s;ation with Court|land, ab&s;olutely avowed an intention of alienating
<PB N="107" REF="034162_0106_0FFC62F68DB9D310">
from Margaretta any part of my e&s;tate; only &s;imply &s;ugge&s;ting the rationality and equity of &s;uch a pro|cedure, and having fully accompli&s;hed my de&s;ign, I was not anxious to guard my &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Courtland, who &s;till continued in our neighbour|hood, was &s;oon apprized of the &s;tratagem which I had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully employed; and &s;uch was the egregious vanity of the coxcomb, that he entertained no doubt of being able to rein&s;tate him&s;elf in the bo&s;om of Margaretta; to which end, he addre&s;&s;ed her by many expo&s;tulatory letters; imputing the part he had acted in the library, entirely to &s;urpri&s;e, and di&s;avowing ev|ery tittle of what had been alleged again&s;t him; de|claring, that tho&s;e calumnies had undoubtedly been fabricated by &s;ome friends of Hamilton's, on purpo&s;e to ruin him in his love; and, that however &s;he might determine, his inviolable attachment to her would never permit him to be other than the humble&s;t of her <HI>adorers.</HI> It was in vain Mi&s;s Melworth a&s;&s;ured him, that his real &s;ituation, his wi&s;hes, or his pur&s;uits, could affect her in no other way, than as &s;he was a general well-wi&s;her to her &s;pecies; and that, having outlived the e&s;teem &s;he once avowed for him, &s;he mu&s;t beg leave to decline all corre&s;pondence with him in future. No &s;ooner were his letters returned unopened, than he per&s;i&s;ted in be&s;ieging every door which &s;he entered; and, having once cro&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold, his clamorous prote&s;tations bore a &s;tronger re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of a madman, than to a rationally attached lover. Mi&s;s Melworth, however, acquitted her&s;elf upon every of the&s;e occa&s;ions, with that cool and determined con&s;i&s;t|ency, which was nece&s;&s;ary to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her character, which confirmed the general &s;entiment in her favour, and placed the whole affair in its true light.</P>
<P>But many days elap&s;ed, before my girl regained her wonted <HI>&s;elf-complacency.</HI> She often lamented the weak|ne&s;s which thus, &s;ubjecting her to &s;o humiliating an attachment, had involved us al&s;o in the utmo&s;t anx|iety; and not being able to forgive her&s;elf, for a time

&s;he continued to deplore. But the good &s;en&s;e &s;he &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, leading her at length to impute her error to inexperience, finally bani&s;hed every re|maining regret, and enabled her to pen a letter to Mi&s;s Worthington, which I produce as a contra&s;t to that which appeared in my la&s;t Gleaner.</P>

<P>For &s;ome time, being left by my matchle&s;s parents wholly to the exerci&s;e of my own rea&s;on, I had begun to di&s;cover that Courtland was not the faultle&s;s be|ing which my imagination had almo&s;t deified. He let &s;lip no opportunity of piqueing Hamilton; he &s;eemed ungenerou&s;ly to aim at pointing the &s;haft which &s;o apparently wounded the bo&s;om of my early friend; and his triumphant exultation partook a degree of meanne&s;s, at which I felt my bo&s;om involuntarily reluct. Once or twice, too, I looked in upon &s;ome poor neighbours of ours, who were &s;truggling with di&s;ea&s;e and penury, in order, in my little way, to af|ford

them what relief my angel benefactor had com|mi&s;&s;ioned me to yield; methought his &s;oul was not formed for pity or for &s;ympathy; no tear &s;tarted in his eye; and while his complai&s;ance induced him to accompany me in my walk, his features gathered a &s;evere and rigid kind of au&s;terity; that gentle and engaging demeanor, for which we have together ad|mired him, was no more; his air was haughty and forbidding, and he deigned not to pour even the oil of &s;oothing words, into the lacerated bo&s;om of &s;or|row! Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions di&s;gu&s;t grew in my &s;oul, and I was con&s;cious that my attachment was gradu|ally dimini&s;hing. A little poem, written by Edward Hamilton, he had the weakne&s;s to claim; this al&s;o, exhibiting him in a new and di&s;agreeable light, made large inroads unpon that e&s;teem, which, while with you, (not con&s;idering, that I thereby violated the du|ty I owed my revered friends) I had &s;o fondly cher|i&s;hed; but the fini&s;hing &s;troke was re&s;erved for the inve&s;tigating wi&s;dom of my father. By the dictates of equity Courtland was tried, and he came out&mdash;I will not &s;ay what he came out. In &s;hort, my Amelia, no longer en&s;laved by that dangerous man, it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to pur&s;ue him by invectives; he mingles, in regard to me, with the re&s;t of his &s;pecies: I owe him no ill-will, and I am only &s;olicitous that no un|happy young body, not patronized and directed, as I have been, may fall a victim to the wiles which an en|emy &s;o fa&s;cinating may prepare for her.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, my utmo&s;t wi&s;hes are gratified; joy once more illumines the revered countenances of my parental friends: I am con&s;cious that I have bani&s;hed anxiety from their bo&s;oms, and this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s &s;eems to dignify and render my exi&s;tence of importance; it is of it&s;elf a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for years of &s;uffer|ing; from a mighty pre&s;&s;ure my &s;oul is relieved; every thing wears its accu&s;tomed face; I &s;kip about the hou&s;e as u&s;ual, and this dwelling is the &s;ame ble&s;&s;|ed man&s;ion which it heretofore was.

<P>GRACIOUS Heaven, what are my &s;en&s;ations! Never did I expect to addre&s;s my dear Mi&s;s Melworth under a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having contributed (as the event may prove) to her ruin: But in deed, and in truth, we have not intentionally erred; and &s;urely the tale which I have to unfold, will bani&s;h from a mind, where integrity and every other virtue have taken up their abode, a wretch, who ought never to have pro|faned a temple &s;o &s;acred.</P>
<P>My poor mother weeps ince&s;&s;antly; &s;he &s;ays &s;he &s;hall never know peace again, if you are not enabled to a&s;&s;ure her, that tranquillity is re&s;tored to a bo&s;om,
<PB N="111" REF="034162_0110_0FFC62EBC5A5C918">
where &s;he hath been acce&s;&s;ary in planting &s;o &s;harp a thorn. Li&s;ten, my beloved Margaretta, to the recital I have to make; and let the virtues of Hamilton ob|tain their due e&s;timation.</P>
<P>About &s;ix years &s;ince, a gentleman by the name of wellwood, was one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable dwellers in this city; his family con&s;i&s;ted only of his lady and daughter, with their dome&s;tics; his daughter had been educated with the exacte&s;t care, and &s;he was, at eight|een, a beautiful and accompli&s;hed young woman. Ju&s;t at this important period, Mr. Wellwood paid the great debt of nature; and &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion did this melancholy and calamitous event make upon the mind of Mrs. Wellwood, who was one of the fir&s;t of women, that after langui&s;hing a few weeks, under all the pre&s;|&s;ure of a rapid decline, &s;he al&s;o obtained her pa&s;&s;port, re&s;igning her life, a confe&s;&s;ed and lamented martyr to grief.</P>
<P>Thus, in a very &s;hort interval, the unfortunate Fran|ces Wellwood &s;aw her&s;elf precipitated from a &s;ituation the mo&s;t eligible, with which the di&s;po&s;itions of pater|nal Providence can po&s;&s;ibly endow a young creature, to that of an unprotected orphan; no guardian father, no indulgent mother remained, to direct her &s;teps, or to approbate her movements! She had been accu&s;|tomed to regard her parents as the &s;ource of wi&s;dom; no de&s;ign had &s;he ever executed, un&s;anctioned by the parental voice, unpropitiated by the maternal &s;mile; and the authors of her exi&s;tence had, in every &s;en&s;e, continued the prop and the confidence of the being they had reared. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Wellwood were natives of this city; none of their kindred re&s;ided among us: So that the beauteous orphan viewed her|&s;elf as alone in the univer&s;e; and when &s;he ca&s;t her di&s;tracted gaze upon the clay cold tenements of a fa|ther and a mother; upon tho&s;e eyes, now for ever clo&s;ed, which, while the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of life remained, had &s;till darted upon her the mo&s;t benign and unequiv|ocal te&s;timonies of affectionate tenderne&s;s; upon tho&s;e lips never again to be un&s;ealed, which had opened but
<PB N="112" REF="034162_0111_0FFC62E8EA25B410">
to enrich her with advice, admonitions, directions, or benedictions; when, with folded arms, &s;he contem|plated tho&s;e trophies of relentle&s;s death, the unutterable angui&s;h of her &s;pirit, depriving her for a time of rea|&s;on, &s;u&s;pended the operation of the &s;ilent &s;orrow, which afterward reduced her to the very verge of the grave! Not a benevolent heart in this city, but deeply felt for the lovely mourner; never did I &s;ee a more pathetic|ally intere&s;ting object. But time, that &s;overeign phy|&s;ician, and the &s;oothing of tho&s;e friends, to whom her virtues and her misfortunes had inexpre&s;&s;ibly endeared her, at length effectuated in her bo&s;om preci&s;ely that &s;tate of tender melancholy, which, in a delicate and &s;en|timental mind, is de&s;cribed as finding a luxury in tears; and her youth and an excellent con&s;titution, &s;urmount|ing the ravages which had been made in her health, &s;he was gradually re&s;tored to a pen&s;ive kind of &s;erenity.</P>
<P>The effects, of which Mr. Wellwood had died po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, exclu&s;ive of his hou&s;ehold moveables, which were very genteel, con&s;i&s;ting altogether of navigation and articles of merchandize, he had directed in his will that they &s;hould be immediately converted into ready money; and the gentleman whom he had appointed his executor, with that integrity and di&s;patch, which are &s;uch con&s;picuous traits in his character, &s;peedily di&s;bur&s;ing every arrearage, and adju&s;ting every affair relative to his tru&s;t, delivered into the hands of Mi&s;s Wellwood the &s;um of two thou&s;and pounds in ca&s;h; this being the whole amount, after &s;uch &s;ettlement, of what remained of her decea&s;ed father's e&s;tate; and of this her patrimony, &s;he was, agreeably to his direction, the &s;ole and uncontrolled po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Behold her then, before &s;he had completed her nineteenth year, ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf and fortune: Her apartments were elegantly furni&s;hed; &s;he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hand|&s;ome library, and two thou&s;and pounds in ready &s;pe|cie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; but her di&s;cretion was unque&s;tionable, and no one pre&s;umed to dictate to Mi&s;s Wellwood.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this cri&s;is, Courtland made his fir&s;t appear|ance at New-Haven. His exteriour and deportment,
<PB N="113" REF="034162_0112_0FFC62E741752758">
we have mutually agreed, are plea&s;ingly fa&s;cinating, and our unguarded &s;ex are but too ea&s;ily captivated. His arts of &s;eduction mu&s;t be prodigious. When I &s;ee you, I will recount the gradual advances, by which he undermined a virtue, that would have been proof again&s;t a common a&s;&s;ailant. Hoodwinking her rea|&s;on, and mi&s;leading her judgment by arguments the mo&s;t &s;ophi&s;tical, <HI>he induced her to view, as the re&s;ult of human regulations, the marriage vow;</HI> it was not to be found in the law of God, and it (or rather, the calling a prie&s;t to witne&s;s it) was calculated only for the meridian of common &s;ouls: True, the in&s;titution an&s;wered political purpo&s;es, and it might be nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve a character; but for him&mdash;his nuptial hour&mdash;&s;hould it take place previous to the death of a ca|priciou&s;ly ob&s;tinate old uncle, who was a bachelor, and who had made his &s;ucceeding to his e&s;tate to de|pend upon his continuing &s;ingle, would mark him the mo&s;t imprudent of men. Mean time, his love for Mi&s;s Wellwood was unbounded; he could not po&s;&s;i|bly exi&s;t without her; he could not bear the idea of &s;eeing her hourly expo&s;ed to the &s;olicitations of tho&s;e numerous pretenders, who thronged about her, while he was con&s;cious that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no &s;uperior claim to her attention; and &s;urely, as they had the &s;ole di&s;po|&s;al of them&s;elves, they might, in the &s;ight of Heaven, exchange their vows; while that Heaven, which would record the deed, would al&s;o &s;anction and crown with &s;ucce&s;s, a union &s;o pure, &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted, and formed &s;o wholly under its own &s;acred au&s;pices; this tran&s;|action would in fact con&s;titute their real nuptials, and upon the demi&s;e of the old gentleman, they would immediately &s;ubmit to authori&s;e their union by mod|ern rites.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Wellwood loved the villain&mdash;Horrid wretch!&mdash;he &s;ucceeded but too well, and &s;he was involved in the deepe&s;t ruin! My tears blot the paper&mdash;would to God that they could cancel her faults, and &s;erve as a <HI>lethe</HI> for her &s;ufferings. Not a &s;oul was apprized of their intercour&s;e; and &s;o well were their mea&s;ures taken,
<PB N="114" REF="034162_0113_0FFC62E514669C48">
that when, &s;ix months after, the young lady di&s;appear|ed, amid the various conjectures which were formed, not even the &s;hadow of &s;u&s;picion glanced upon Court|land; every one expre&s;&s;ed, in their own way, his or her wonder, grief, and apprehen&s;ion; the whole town took an intere&s;t in her unexpected removal, and Court|land was with the foremo&s;t to expre&s;s his a&s;toni&s;hment; but as Mi&s;s Wellwood was entirely independent, no one was authori&s;ed to commence an active inquiry or pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The attention excited by any extraordinary event, after having its run, at length &s;ub&s;ides; and Mi&s;s Wellwood cea&s;ed by degrees to be the &s;ubject of con|ver&s;ation; nor hath her &s;trange flight been in any &s;ort accounted for, until two days &s;ince, when Bridget in|troduced into our breakfa&s;ting parlour this forlorn female, who, immediately upon fixing her eyes on my mother, &s;unk down almo&s;t breathle&s;s at her feet! It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to add, that we in&s;tantly rai&s;ed the haple&s;s orphan, and that after recognizing, with &s;ome difficulty, the well-known features of Mi&s;s Wellwood, we received from her lips the foregoing particulars.</P>
<P>Upon her quitting New-Haven, &s;he repaired directly to apartments, which had been taken for her by Court|land, in a di&s;tant village; her patrimony, you will not doubt, was relinqui&s;hed to her betrayer. After &s;acri|ficing her honour, every thing el&s;e became a trifle. At fir&s;t, he vouch&s;afed to &s;upport her; but for the&s;e two la&s;t years, either wanting ability or inclination, &s;he has not been able to obtain from him the &s;malle&s;t &s;um! Of her furniture, of her valuable library, of every thing &s;he is &s;tripped; and for &s;ome months pa&s;t &s;he hath been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of parting with her clothes, and of availing her&s;elf of her &s;kill in needle work, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of her&s;elf and three &s;ons, whom &s;he hath borne to Courtland; and the little wretches, with their injured mother, have long been in want of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life! Yet, through all this, &s;he hath been &s;upported, being buoyed up by the hope of an ultimate re&s;idence with the father of
<PB N="115" REF="034162_0114_0FFC62E226D187D0">
her children: By the laws of Heaven, &s;he regards her|&s;elf as already his wife, while &s;he hath repeatedly, with floods of tears, be&s;ought the abandoned man to confer upon her, by the rites of the church, a title &s;o honourable; and, though &s;till repul&s;ed, and often with &s;everity, &s;he hath never de&s;paired, until the tidings that Courtland was on the point of marriage with a young lady, who had abode for &s;ome time with us, reached her ears; this heart-rending intelligence pro|duced her, upon the before mentioned morning, in our parlour; this hath al&s;o procured you the &s;orrow, which &s;o melancholy a recital will doubtle&s;s occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The once beautiful form of Mi&s;s Wellwood is now &s;urpri&s;ingly emaciated; the few pa&s;t weeks hath made dreadful havoc in her con&s;titution; we a&s;&s;ay to pour into her lacerated bo&s;om what con&s;olation is in our power; we have made her acquainted with your char|acter, with its marked integrity and uniform con&s;i&s;|tency; and we have encouraged her to hope every thing from a goodne&s;s &s;o perfect. The de&s;olated &s;uf|ferer will her&s;elf addre&s;s you. Alas, alas! what fur|ther can I &s;ay! it is with difficulty that I have written thus far; but this information we have judged ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. May God pre&s;erve my dear Mi&s;s Melworth from &s;o black a villain&mdash;every thing is to be feared. For my&s;elf, I &s;tand, in my own apprehen&s;ion, as a culprit before you.

by which &s;he might have &s;haped her cour&s;e, through an <HI>event-judging</HI> and <HI>unfeeling</HI> world.

Mi&s;s Worthington hath conde&s;cended to become my in|troducer, and &s;he informs me that &s;he hath unfolded to you the &s;tory of my woes!</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, I write not, mo&s;t re&s;pected young lady, either to exonerate my&s;elf, or to criminate an unfortu|nate man, who hath had the pre&s;umption to a&s;pire to &s;uch daring heights! Regi&s;tered in the uncontrovert|ible records of heaven, the wife of Courtland, in walks &s;o reprehen&s;ible, it would ill become me to be found. No, Madam, I write to &s;upplicate, and on my bended knees I am pro&s;trated before you&mdash;I write to &s;upplicate you to u&s;e your intere&s;t in the heart of Courtland, in my favour. Help me, O thou unblemi&s;hed votary of virtue! help me to reclaim a hu&s;band, who, not naturally bad, hath too long wandered in the danger|ous paths of di&s;&s;ipation; who hath drank too deeply of the empoi&s;oned cup of error; and who, if he is not &s;oon rou&s;ed from his vi&s;ionary career, may &s;uddenly be precipitated into the gulph of perdition!</P>
<P>I &s;aid that Mr. Courtland was not naturally bad; and believe me, good young lady, I have, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, ob&s;erved the rectitude of his heart. Early indulgence, and a mi&s;taken mode of education, hath been his ruin; but the amiable qualities which are natal in his bo&s;om, have, neverthele&s;s, through the weeds by which they have been well nigh choaked, oc|ca&s;ionally di&s;covered them&s;elves. Yet, whatever are his faults, they can never obliterate my errors; <HI>doubt|le&s;s he ob&s;erved in me &s;ome blameable weakne&s;s,</HI> or he would never have taken tho&s;e unwarrantable &s;teps, which were the con&s;equence of our acquaintance; and now, circum&s;tanced as we are, a failure of duty in

him, can never apologize for the want of every proper exertion on my &s;ide. He is the father of my children; I have a pre&s;entiment that he may be re|covered to the bo&s;om of equity; and, if he will permit me, I will watch over him as my deare&s;t trea&s;ure. Let him but acknowledge the honourable and endear|ing ties, father and hu&s;band; let him but &s;anction them in the face of the world, and I will &s;oothe his aching head; I will &s;mooth his thorny pillow; and, in every circum&s;tance, in &s;ickne&s;s and in health, I will continue that faithful Fanny, whom he hath &s;o often &s;worn never to for&s;ake, and whom, in the fulne&s;s of his heart, he hath called Heaven to witne&s;s, he would ever prefer to all created beings.</P>
<P>Perhaps he can no more command the &s;ums which I have yielded into his hands&mdash;be it &s;o, they were mine, I made them his, and he had a right to di&s;po&s;e of them&mdash;Nay, I think I had rather find him de&s;ti|tute; for &s;uch a &s;ituation will acquit him of that cru|elty, with which he is otherwi&s;e chargeable on account of his late neglects. What are pecuniary emoluments, compared to that real felicity, which is to be derived from a mutual, a faithful, and an unbroken attach|ment? I have made the experiment, and I can confi|dently pronounce it in truth a fact&mdash;<HI>that we want but little here below.</HI> Let him know, Madam, that I will draw the impenetrable veil of &s;ilence over the pa&s;t; that we will commence anew the voyage of life; and that if he will at length be ju&s;t, his returning kindne&s;s, by invigorating once more this poor, this enervated frame, will re&s;tore alacrity to my efforts; and that I am, in that ca&s;e, po&s;itive, our combined exertions will procure for our&s;elves, and our little ones, the <HI>nece&s;&s;aries of life.</HI></P>
<P>What can I &s;ay? It is for my children I am thus importunate; were it not for their dear &s;akes, the &s;to|ry of my &s;ufferings &s;hould never interrupt the felicity of Mi&s;s Melworth. No, believe me, no&mdash;but I would &s;eek &s;ome turfed pillow, whereon to re&s;t my weary head; and, clo&s;ing forever the&s;e humid lids, I would

<P>IT was well that my girl had di&s;carded Courtland from her heart, and that &s;he had almo&s;t entirely re|covered her tranquillity, previous to the receipt of the&s;e letters; otherwi&s;e, the &s;udden revolution they would have occa&s;ioned, mu&s;t, in a young and impa&s;&s;ioned mind, have uprooted her rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Old Mr. Wellwood had been one of the fir&s;t of my friends; and from his countenance and advice, on my &s;etting out in life, I had derived material advantages. The di&s;appearance of his daughter had much per|plexed me. I was fearful &s;he was ill advi&s;ed, but from the idea I had entertained of her di&s;cretion, I had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the truth. Yet &s;he never ru&s;hed upon my memory, without giving birth in my bo&s;om to &s;en&s;ations truly painful; and I had been con&s;tantly &s;olicitous to di&s;cover the place of her retreat.</P>
<P>Thus, under the influence of equity and gratitude, I hope my readers will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that in Mi&s;s Wellwood's affairs, I found my&s;elf nat|urally impelled to take a very active part. Marga|retta &s;peedily re&s;ponded to both the ladies; but

<HEAD>Mi&s;s MELWORTH to Mi&s;s WELLWOOD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Village of&mdash;, <DATE>Augu&s;t 1&s;t, 1789.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE my dear Madam, received your pathet|ically plaintive epi&s;tle; and, over the melancholy re|cital of your woes, I have &s;hed many tears. I lament your &s;orrows, and I honour the propriety of your pre&s;ent feelings and wi&s;hes: but a letter which I ye&s;terday wrote to Mi&s;s Worthington, and which &s;he will &s;oon receive, will, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, convince you of the indelicacy and inutility of my interference relative to Mr. Courtland. Before the name of Mi&s;s Wellwood had been announced to me, I had been con|vinced of my error, in entertaining the mo&s;t di&s;tant views of a &s;erious connexion with that gentleman; and the preference my inexperienced heart had avow|ed for him, was eradicated from my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, if the ever honoured guardians of my unwary &s;teps, had not &s;till been continued to me. <HI>en|&s;nared as I too certainly was,</HI> Mi&s;s Wellwood's <HI>wrongs would not have exhibited a &s;olitary trait in the hi&s;tory of the unfeeling de&s;poiler!</HI> You mu&s;t excu&s;e me, Madam, if I do not adopt <HI>your mildne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> when &s;peak|ing of a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> who&s;e atrocious conduct hath bla&s;ted in their early blow, the opening pro&s;pects of a young lady, who&s;e fair mind &s;eems eminently formed for all tho&s;e &s;ocial and tender intercour&s;es, which con&s;titute and brighten the plea&s;ing round of dome&s;tic life. Surely, Mi&s;s Wellwood&mdash;yet, &s;en&s;ible that painful retro&s;pection will avail us nothing, I &s;top &s;hort.</P>
<P>But, my amiable panegyri&s;t, though I, my&s;elf, am ineligible as a mediatre&s;s, between parties who&s;e inter|e&s;ts <HI>ought indeed to be con&s;idered as one,</HI> I am authorized to offer you the extricating hands, and protecting arms of tho&s;e matchle&s;s benefactors, who, with unex|ampled conde&s;cen&s;ion, have dignified the <HI>orphan</HI> Mar|garetta, by inve&s;ting her with the title of <HI>their daugh|ter;</HI>

nor is this an empty title; their parental wi&s;dom, their parental indulgence&mdash;<HI>but come and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> I am commanded to &s;olicit you immediately to repair to an a&s;ylum, and to hearts, which will ever be open for your reception. My father, Madam, confe&s;&s;es e&s;&s;en|tial and various obligations to your decea&s;ed parent; and he hath long been anxiou&s;ly de&s;irous to render the arrears, which were due to Mr. Wellwood, into the hands of his ever lovely repre&s;entative. The bearer of this letter is commi&s;&s;ioned to pay you the &s;um of fifty pounds, which you are reque&s;ted to receive, as a <HI>part of the intere&s;t,</HI> which hath been, for &s;uch a length of time, your due; it may an&s;wer your pre&s;ent ex|igencies, and the <HI>principal</HI> is &s;till in re&s;erve. It is with much plea&s;ure, I avail my&s;elf of the orders which are given me, to repeat my &s;olicitations, that you would, without he&s;itation, ha&s;ten to this man&s;ion. An elderly man and woman, who are to return to our village in the next &s;tage, and who have long been our very re&s;|pectable neighbours, will call upon you at Colonel Worthington's, to take your commands; and if you will be &s;o obliging as to put your&s;elf under their care, they will &s;ee you conveyed in &s;afety to one, who, in addition to the general and unque&s;tionable humanity of his character, feels his heart operated upon, in re|gard to Mi&s;s Wellwood, by the ancient and inviolable claims of gratitude.</P>
<P>Mr. Courtland, though not at pre&s;ent our vi&s;itor, is &s;till a re&s;ident in this neighbourhood; and my father bids me a&s;&s;ure you, that every rational &s;tep &s;hall be taken, which can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have the remote&s;t tendency toward the re&s;toration of your peace. He him&s;elf will undertake your cau&s;e; and as his plans are always the re&s;ult of wi&s;dom and penetration, he is not &s;eldom gratified by the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes. He will &s;eek Mr. Courtland; he will a&s;&s;ail him by tho&s;e invincible arguments, with which equity, rea&s;on and nature will furni&s;h him; and &s;hould he &s;till remain obdurate, my dear and commi&s;erating father will, neverthele&s;s, aid you by his coun&s;el, and continue

unto you his protection; he will a&s;&s;i&s;t you in educat|ing your young people, and in di&s;po&s;ing of them in a manner, which will render them <HI>u&s;eful members of &s;oci|ety:</HI> In &s;hort, no efforts which benevolence can com|mand, will be wanting, to alleviate your misfortunes. Cheer up then, lovely mourner; the orphan's friend is ours: I predict that the &s;mile of tranquillity will again illumine your grief-worn countenance; and &s;hould I yet have to rai&s;e to you the voice of felicita|tion, <HI>good, in that event, will be educed from evil,</HI> and I &s;hall then cea&s;e to regret a circum&s;tance, which at pre&s;ent, as often as it is remembered, tinges my cheek with the blu&s;h of confu&s;ion. Were it nece&s;&s;ary, I would add, that no means &s;hall be left una&s;&s;ayed, which may be within the reach of, dear Madam, your truly commi&s;erating, and &s;incere well-wi&s;her,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>TAKING it for granted, that the candid reader will allow for the partiality of a young creature, <HI>who&s;e high &s;en&s;e of common benefits,</HI> and who&s;e gratitude had rendered her almo&s;t an enthu&s;ia&s;t,&mdash;I intrude no com|ment thereon. Margaretta's letter &s;oon produced Mi&s;s Wellwood in our family; and upon the morning af|ter her arrival, I &s;at off in pur&s;uit of Mr. Courtland. My mo&s;t direct cour&s;e brought me to rap at the door of his lodgings, and as I was rather early, I made my&s;elf &s;ure of finding him within. My a&s;toni&s;hment, however, was not equal to my regret, when I was in|formed by his landlady, that a writ of attachment, being the evening before &s;erved upon him, at the &s;uit of Mr.&mdash;, and he not being able to procure &s;ure|ties, he was then lodged in the county jail. I he&s;i|tated not in regard to the mea&s;ures which were be&s;t to be taken; a few moments produced me in that abode of the mi&s;erable; and I found little difficulty in ob|taining an interview with the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Courtland&mdash;never &s;hall I forget his appearance&mdash;all tho&s;e airs of importance, which had marked his innate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperiority, were whelmed in the &s;torm
<PB N="122" REF="034162_0121_0FFC62D0CE531570">
of adver&s;ity, that had at length bur&s;t upon him. His haggard looks proclaimed, that &s;leep, in her accu&s;|tomed manner, had for&s;aken his dreary abode; his dre&s;s was neglected; his hair in di&s;ordered ringlets hung upon his &s;houlders: In &s;hort, &s;carce a ve&s;tige of the fini&s;hed gentleman remained; and his folded arms and vacant countenance, as I beheld him unob&s;erved, were almo&s;t de&s;criptive of in&s;anity: But the jailer announcing my name, his agonized and unaffected di&s;compo&s;ure commanded my utmo&s;t commi&s;eration; an expre&s;&s;ion indicative of mingling confu&s;ion, &s;urpri&s;e and apprehen&s;ion, in&s;tantly &s;uffu&s;ed his cheek; and, with extreme perturbation, he exclaimed, <Q>Good God! Mr. Vigillius&mdash;this is too much&mdash;but, for|give me, Sir, <HI>the uniformity of your character</HI> will not permit a continuance of the idea, that you are come hither either to reproach or in&s;ult me.</Q></P>
<P>"To in&s;ult you, Mr. Courtland! God forbid. I come hither rather the petitioner of your favour; and it is a truth, that I at this moment feel in regard to you, all the father predominating in my bo&s;om; but, having matter for your private ear, I mu&s;t beg the indulgence of this gentleman for a few moments."</P>
<P>The humane keeper withdrew with much civility; and the con&s;ternation of our delinquent was unuttera|ble, while I proceeded to inform him of the early knowledge I had obtained of the commencement and progre&s;s of his career; of my information in regard to the ruined &s;tate of his affairs; and of my actual cor|re&s;pondence with his principal creditors. "I have opened my bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir," I added, "by this exordi|um, on purpo&s;e to let you know how well qualified I am to &s;erve you; and however you may have &s;mart|ed, while I have thus taken it upon me to probe your wounds, I flatter my&s;elf you may be induced to ble&s;s the hand, which is furni&s;hed al&s;o with a &s;pecific. In &s;hort, Sir, I am this morning authorized to act in your affairs&mdash;<HI>a fair plaintiff hath con&s;tituted me her attorney, and I come to offer you terms of accommodation</HI>&mdash;Mi&s;s Wellwood, Sir&mdash;" At the &s;ound of this name he

changed colour, bit his lips, groaned deeply, and vehe|mently articulated&mdash;"<HI>Je&s;us God, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on me!</HI>" and, as if that injured female her&s;elf had been pre&s;ent, he thus continued: <Q><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> Wellwood&mdash;<HI>lovely, but too credulous fair one&mdash;wretched woman!&mdash;I have undone thee; but, Madam, my death &s;hall &s;oon pre&s;ent you the only compen&s;ation in my power.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"I came not, Sir," interrupted I, "<HI>to point to the defencele&s;s bo&s;om the &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t of de&s;pair:</HI> If you plea&s;e, I will read a letter, which was written by Mi&s;s Well|wood to my daughter." I read; and, as I folded the paper, I beheld with a&s;toni&s;hment, the tear of contrition bedewing his pallid cheek! "<HI>Welcome &s;tranger!</HI>" he exclaimed&mdash;<Q><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">n&mdash;injured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aint&mdash;forgiving martyr I&mdash;Yes, Heaven is my witne&s;s, that the tendere&s;t affection of which this obdurate heart hath ever been capa|ble, hath &s;till been the undivided, unalienated po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of</HI> Fanny Wellwood&mdash;but, Sir, &s;he knows not the depth of my mi&s;ery&mdash;God of heaven! my crimes have <HI>already precipitated me into the gulph of perdition,</HI> and there remains no remedy.</Q></P>
<P>But not to fatigue my readers by further circumlo|cution, I found that our gentleman had become as wax in my hand; and I propo&s;ed to him, that if I could procure his enlargement, he &s;hould retire imme|diately to my dwelling, where he would meet Mi&s;s Wellwood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that the nuptial ceremony being <HI>le|gally</HI> performed, my hou&s;e &s;hould become his ca&s;tle; that I my&s;elf would undertake his affairs, thoroughly inve&s;tigate every point, and endeavour to adju&s;t mat|ters with his creditors.</P>
<P>My propo&s;al was accepted, <HI>with the mo&s;t extravagant and rapturous demon&s;trations of joy;</HI> and my intere&s;t, combined with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a &s;ub&s;tantial neighbour's, &s;oon liberating the captive, produced him a <HI>happy and a grateful bridegroom.</HI> The rites of the church were per|formed; not a &s;ingle ceremony was omitted&mdash;while Margaretta and Serafina, blooming as Hebe, and cheer|ful as the morning, officiated as bride-maids.</P>
<P>Agreeably to my promi&s;e, I very &s;oon opened my

negociation with the different claimants upon Mr. Courtland. New-Haven furni&s;hed me with many auxiliaries; it was &s;ufficient to produce the daughter of Mr. Wellwood, to command, in her favour, the mo&s;t energetic efforts: We &s;peedily obtained a very advantageous compromi&s;e; our debtor was, by the joint a&s;&s;i&s;tance of many re&s;pectable characters, &s;et up in bu&s;ine&s;s; and the deficiencies of nature and education, which we have noted in him, were abundantly &s;up|plied, <HI>by the abilities, application, and economical arrange|ments of</HI> Mrs. Courtland. Every year, a regular divi|dend of the profits of their bu&s;ine&s;s is remitted to their creditors; a large part of the old arrears is di&s;charged; and they bid fair, in the run of a few revolving &s;ea|&s;ons, to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of a very hand&s;ome compe|tency.</P>

<Q><L>And now the ripening harve&s;t clu&s;tering round,</L>
<L>With fruits mature our well form'd hopes were crown'd.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I AM &s;ometimes wonderfully amu&s;ed by the vari|ous comments upon the&s;e my lucubrations, which in the cour&s;e of my peregrinations are frequently pour|ed into my ear. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that as I jour|ney from place to place, I am &s;ufficiently &s;olicitous to collect the &s;entiments of my readers; and that although I am often &s;ubjected to extreme mortification in this my anxious pur&s;uit, yet I have, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, inhaled, from the voice of the genuine critic, the fine effluvia of well-judged prai&s;e.</P>
<P>But during a late tour, which I made to a di&s;tant metropolis, I was not &s;o fortunate as to ob&s;erve that my laurel crown was much indebted to the brighten|ing hand of fame; for although I then breathed the natal air of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Magazine, yet I found that upon the ear of <HI>the many,</HI> even the name of the Gleaner had never vibrated; and that a con&s;iderable
<PB N="125" REF="034162_0124_0FFC62C763C26370">
majority of tho&s;e who&s;e attention he had engaged, &s;eemed more occupied in detecting the <HI>real author,</HI> than in e&s;&s;aying to inve&s;tigate the merit of his productions! An old lady, (taking off her &s;pectacles, and laying down her knitting-work) informed me &s;he had been credibly a&s;&s;ured, that the Gleaner had in fact never been married; that he was a young man, a dweller in Worce&s;ter, and that he never having had a <HI>bit of a wi&s;e,</HI> it was impo&s;&s;ible to tell what to believe.</P>
<P>A <HI>facetious divine,</HI> &s;itting by, gravely replied, "Well, if the &s;coundrel has impo&s;ed upon the public by a fic|titious tale, he ought &s;urely to be to&s;&s;ed in a blanket; and I, for my part, am willing to lend any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power, to deliver a delinquent, &s;o atrocious, to con|dign puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>A &s;ober young woman next joined in the conver&s;a|tion, proceeding with great &s;olemnity to give in her evidence: She &s;aid &s;he had but ju&s;t returned from New-Haven; that &s;he happened to be there when the &s;tory of Mi&s;s Wellwood came out; and that &s;he was, by unque&s;tionable authority, po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured they had never heard the name of Margaretta Melworth, until they &s;aw it in the Magazine; that the Wellwoods, the Courtlands, and even the Worthingtons, (as de&s;crib|ed by the Gleaner) were wholly unknown in that city.</P>
<P>"P&s;haw, p&s;haw, young woman," &s;aid a pedant, who had eyed the fair &s;peaker with an air of &s;uper|cilious contempt, "you know nothing of the matter; but ignorance is always forth putting. I tell you that I had the honour of receiving my education at Yale College; I was there at the very period, on which the Gleaner repre&s;ents his Margaretta as having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in the city of New-Haven, and I more than once &s;aw that young lady at church, and in &s;everal private families; it is true that being then but a you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, (for it was my fir&s;t year in the &s;eminary) I was not very intimate with Mi&s;s Melworth, otherwi&s;e, I doubt not, I &s;hould have been made acquainted with every particular which he records." A te&s;timony &s;o deci&s;ive, could not be controverted; the old lady re&s;umed her knitting, and an air of general complacency took place.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="034162_0125_0FFC62C5E196DC98">
I cannot help regarding this <HI>hunting after names,</HI> as de&s;criptive of the frivolity of the human mind: No &s;ooner does an anonymous piece make its appearance, than curio&s;ity inve&s;ts it&s;elf in the &s;tole of &s;agacity, conjecture is upon the rack&mdash;Who is he? Where does he live? What is his <HI>real name,</HI> and occupation? And to the importance of the&s;e que&s;tions, con&s;iderations of real weight give place; as if the being able to a&s;cer|tain a name was replete with information of the mo&s;t &s;alutary kind. Whereas, if the writing is in no &s;ort per&s;onal, and cannot be con&s;trued into a libel, a knowl|edge of the author can be of no moment, neither can a name de&s;ignate a character. <HI>Facts, real events,</HI> have often been communicated to the world <HI>under feigned names;</HI> and in&s;truction not &s;eldom arrays it&s;elf in the decent and alluring veil of allegory.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the reader is to &s;can the <HI>intrin&s;ic value</HI> and <HI>general tendency</HI> of the compo&s;ition; if that is con&s;iderable, if that is laudable, he ought to leave the author to announce him&s;elf under what au&s;pices he &s;hall judge proper.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing from the&s;e <HI>name-hunters,</HI> I joined a &s;elect tea party, when I had an opportunity of hearing the work it&s;elf very freely de&s;canted upon; and while I was hum|bled by the uncandid and &s;atirical di&s;qui&s;ition which I underwent, I was proportionably elated at ob&s;erving that my daughter was as much a favourite in the world at large, as in the village in which &s;he hath been educat|ed. In Margaretta every one appeared intere&s;ted; and, however que&s;tionable the merit of the Gleaner was deemed, Mi&s;s Melworth obtained her full &s;hare of applau&s;e. A dam&s;el, verging upon thirty, the height of who&s;e feathers was enormous, pronounced the poet|ry of the Gleaner <HI>pitiful;</HI> declared his e&s;&s;ays in general much <HI>below a mediocrity;</HI> and &s;he added, that in her opinion they depreciated as rapidly as the paper cur|rency of in&s;olvent memory; that his la&s;t numbers were <HI>mon&s;trou&s;ly</HI> unnatural; that the library &s;cene in partic|ular was quite <HI>outree,</HI> &s;ince it was impo&s;&s;ible to con|ceive of a man &s;o <HI>truly polite,</HI> thus pa&s;&s;ionate; that her

friend Mrs. G&mdash;condemned tho&s;e writings altogeth|er, and that Mrs. G&mdash;having <HI>travelled, and &s;een the world, mu&s;t undoubtedly be acknowledged a competent judge.</HI> Yet &s;he allowed Margaretta to be a decent young per|&s;on; and &s;he doubted not if &s;he had been left entirely to her&s;elf, &s;he would have generou&s;ly cho&s;en the <HI>man of her heart,</HI> whatever might have been the embarra&s;&s;ments in which his <HI>juvenile errors</HI> might have involved him.</P>
<P>"<HI>Juvenile errors!</HI>" repeated a female who &s;at next her. "Is it po&s;&s;ible, Madam, that you can be&s;tow an epithet &s;o gentle upon crimes of &s;o deep a die? O! that our &s;ex were con&s;cious of their true dignity; <HI>that they were ju&s;t to them&s;elves;</HI> then &s;hould we no longer behold the unprincipled betrayer obtaining the confi|dence of virtue; then would the de&s;poiler, bani&s;hed from &s;ociety, be nece&s;&s;itated to pre&s;s forward to the path of rectitude, and a uniform pur&s;uit of goodne&s;s becoming the price of his re&s;toration to the privileges and immunities of a &s;ocial being, he would be compell|ed to array him&s;elf in the garments of con&s;i&s;tent equi|ty. For my own part," continued the fair rationali&s;t, "I am free to own, however &s;ingular it may be deemed, that unblemi&s;hed virtue is, in my e&s;timation, as e&s;&s;ential in a man, as in a woman; and that as <HI>man is commonly the primary aggre&s;&s;or,</HI> I regard a <HI>male pro&s;ti|tute</HI> with even greater dete&s;tation than I do an aban|doned female. I profe&s;s my&s;elf an admirer of the Gleaner. I conceive him to be a moral writer; and I mu&s;t own that far from thinking the library &s;cene <HI>un|natural,</HI> I have conceived it inimitably drawn. <HI>Court|land</HI> is repre&s;ented from the beginning as a man ex|tremely &s;uperficial; that &s;hallow waters are not &s;el|dom noi&s;y, is a common ob&s;ervation; and it is as true that in &s;ilent maje&s;ty the great profound may &s;tand collected. Mr. Vigillius, with infinite addre&s;s, had wrought up to the highe&s;t pitch, the &s;anguine expecta|tions of his man; he is in fancy placed upon an emi|nence at which he had long aimed; and having, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, at length obtained the enviable &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes, he is &s;uddenly da&s;hed therefrom.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="034162_0127_0FFC62C1F57C42C0">
"Is it then &s;urpri&s;ing to find him off his guard, e&s;|pecially when it is remembered, that his rea&s;ons for keeping mea&s;ures with the Gleaner were no longer in force? Viewing the matter in this light, I confe&s;s, it appears to me rather extraordinary, that his pa&s;&s;ions di&s;covered <HI>no greater exce&s;s.</HI> But, be this as it may, I declare to you, that Margaretta captivates my very &s;oul; that the virtues attributed to Hamilton &s;trike me mo&s;t plea&s;ingly: I am charmed with the open in|tegrity, and the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ly con&s;i&s;tency of the character of that youth; and I cannot but hope that the en&s;uing Gleaner, recounting his union with Mi&s;s Melworth, will give us an opportunity of contemplating the mo&s;t faultle&s;s pair who have ever lighted the torch of Hy|men, &s;ince the lord of paradi&s;e received our general mother from the hand of her Creator."</P>
<P>"What in the name of ingenuity," interrupted the lady who was filling tea, "<HI>has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e done with Hamilton?</HI> I prote&s;t I am enchanted by that divine fellow; his di&s;daining to enter the li&s;ts with Courtland, and his ab&s;enting him&s;elf during the pur&s;uit of that unworthy pretender, was a deportment at once dignified, proper and manly. I confe&s;s that it hath been no &s;mall di&s;|appointment to me, to find him in the &s;everal la&s;t Gleaners but barely mentioned; and I am ab&s;olutely impatient to hear of his return from exile, and of the re&s;toration of his hopes."</P>
<P>The lovely &s;entimentali&s;ts here adverted to, will rec|ollect a conver&s;ation &s;o recent; and, from the throng which upon that occa&s;ion crowded the levee of Mrs.&mdash;, they may po&s;&s;ibly recognize the Gleaner; but even in this ca&s;e, I feel plea&s;ingly a&s;&s;ured, that in the bo&s;om of candour, di&s;cretion and good-nature, <HI>my &s;e|cret is perfectly &s;afe,</HI> while I am confident, that by <HI>the many I &s;hall remain untraced.</HI> My amiable panegyri&s;ts were uncon&s;cious that they delivered their &s;entiments in the pre&s;ence of an <HI>intere&s;ted man, who hung upon their lips, engraving their words in characters indelible upon the tablets of his brea&s;t;</HI> yet, as I am happy in an opportu|nity of rendering to &s;uperior merit the tribute of

<P>It happened that Mr. Hamilton returned home up|on the very evening which witne&s;&s;ed the nuptials of Mr. Courtland and Mi&s;s Wellwood. Being ignorant of his route, it had not been in our power to follow him by letter; and he was con&s;equently unacquainted with every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed in our village, during his ab&s;ence. This plan he had purpo&s;ely concerted, with an expectation of bani&s;hing from his bo&s;om tho&s;e tender &s;entiments of Margaretta, which were incon&s;i&s;t|ent with his peace; and fondly imagining that he had effectuated his wi&s;hes, he alighted at the lodgings of Serafina, whither he fir&s;t repaired, in tolerable tran|quillity; but, on inquiring for Mi&s;s Clifford, being rather abruptly informed by her maid, that her young lady pa&s;&s;ed that evening in the family of Mr. Vigillius, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the marriage of Mr. Courtland, he di&s;covered, in a &s;ingle moment, the cruel fallacy of tho&s;e hopes he had &s;o confidently cheri&s;hed. He was unacquainted with the exi&s;tence and even the name of Mi&s;s Wellwood: It was Courtland's wedding night; he could think of no one but Margaretta; a thou&s;and varying ideas ru&s;hed in&s;tantaneou&s;ly upon his mind; all his purpo&s;es were broken; and he &s;aw that, &s;o far from accompli&s;hing the laudable end which he had propo&s;ed, by tearing him&s;elf from the beloved object, he had too probably accelerated his own ruin.</P>
<P>In &s;peechle&s;s agony he cla&s;ped his hands, and rai&s;|ing his fine eyes to Heaven, he ha&s;tily withdrew to the retirement of his own chamber, where, &s;ummon|ing rea&s;on, fortitude and religion to his aid, he en|deavoured to rally his &s;cattered forces, to recollect

What progre&s;s he would have made in this conflict, and on which &s;ide victory would have declared, I pre|tend not to determine; for after the combat had con|tinued, with various &s;ucce&s;s, from twilight grey, until the &s;ober hour of twelve, the whole phalanx of di&s;cre|tion was thrown into di&s;order, by the following little harmle&s;s &s;crip of paper, received from the hand of Serafina; true, it bore on its milk-white &s;urface cer|tain <HI>caballi&s;tic</HI> in&s;criptions, which &s;eemed endowed with magic influence; and Hamilton read with no le&s;s ar|dour than it was penned, the language of friend&s;hip.</P>

<P>IT is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to add, that Edward imme|diately obeyed this flattering &s;ummons: He was at a lo&s;s what to conceive, and he was ready to hope
<PB N="131" REF="034162_0130_0FFC62B9BB78DA80">
for impo&s;&s;ibilities; but a &s;hort interval pre&s;enting him before the companion of his youth, he had little time for conjecture; and the propitious explanation was no &s;ooner given, than, ab&s;orbed in a delirium of joy, he lo&s;t &s;ight of every ill, and pronounced him&s;elf wholly invulnerable, altogether &s;uperior to the &s;hafts of fu|ture &s;orrow.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing morning produced him, the image of rationally complacent happine&s;s, in our bridal circle. He attended Mi&s;s Clifford; Mary and my&s;elf were addre&s;&s;ed by him with plea&s;ing re&s;pect; and while he bowed upon the hand of Margaretta, his eye beamed unutterable tenderne&s;s; a refined and animated kind of affection, and a glow of ineffable &s;atisfaction, &s;well|ed every expre&s;&s;ive feature, mantled upon his cheek, and &s;eemed to inve&s;t him with &s;upernatural graces: In &s;hort, the fine manly open countenance evidently a&s;&s;umed a cele&s;tial contour, and the charming youth was never before &s;o completely captivating.</P>
<P>In the beautiful face of Margaretta, mingling &s;ur|pri&s;e and plea&s;ure were agreeably blended; a blu&s;h of &s;en&s;ibility pervaded her cheek; and an attachment, which I dare believe will be la&s;ting as her life, gradu|ally enli&s;ted every faculty of her &s;oul; an attachment, rai&s;ed upon the &s;uper&s;tructure of e&s;teem, entwining a full growth of amity, and finally attaining the hono|rary wreath of rationally approved love. Such an attachment was alone worthy the bo&s;om of Mi&s;s Mel|worth; and I had the happine&s;s to ob&s;erve, that her meliorated pa&s;&s;ions, rectified and confirmed, at length pointed to the centre of true and cha&s;ti&s;ed felicity.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was &s;he a&s;&s;ured of the continued, and even augmented tenderne&s;s, and of the confiding friend&s;hip of her Edward, than &s;he yielded up her whole heart, without he&s;itation, to the &s;weetly fa&s;cinating impre&s;|&s;ion. Sanctioned by duty, authorized by rea&s;on, and borne forward upon the feathery &s;ails of white-bo&s;omed hope, &s;he did not &s;ee that &s;he ought to blu&s;h at avow|ing tho&s;e &s;entiments of preference, which her youthful heart acknowledged; and they were, in truth, as pure
<PB N="132" REF="034162_0131_0FFC62B6C6A6C240">
as tho&s;e which are impre&s;&s;ed upon &s;eraphic bo&s;oms, amid the paradi&s;e of their God.</P>
<P>During the period which preceded her marriage, &s;he gave and received many vi&s;its to and from Mi&s;s Worthington. She made many little tours round the country; and, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;trikingly commanding ex|terior, with manners &s;o truly plea&s;ing, &s;he was, of cour&s;e, followed by a train of admirers. Courtlands, Bellamours and Plodders, of every de&s;cription, crowded about her; and, a&s;&s;ailed on every &s;ide by the perni|ciou&s;ly enervating and empoi&s;oned airs of adulation, the uniformity of her character was put to the &s;e|vere&s;t te&s;t.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Melworth, however, was fully equal to the or|deal which was thus prepared for her; and &s;he con|tinued to receive her admirers of every de&s;cription, in a manner which was truly worthy of approbation. The impa&s;&s;ioned feelings of the devoted heart, never contributed, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, to her amu&s;ement: She had not to charge her&s;elf with inflicting a &s;ingle moment's unnece&s;&s;ary pain; and no &s;ooner did the &s;erious pretender advance his claim, then his profe&s;|&s;ions of love, though received with grateful re&s;pect, were deci&s;ively rejected. Obligations for every hon|orary te&s;timony, &s;he was free to acknowledge; but &s;he was not ambitious to enli&s;t a train of danglers. Her heart, tremblingly alive to the merits of Hamilton, al|though the nature of their connexion was not publickly known, was ready, almo&s;t indignantly, to re&s;ent the officious competition of tho&s;e, whom her delicacy in|duced her to con&s;ider as intruders. But rea&s;on, true to its office, corrected the fervid ebullitions of pa&s;&s;ion, and always brought her back to that tranquillity of mind, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the full exerci&s;e of her fine tal|ents. Ob&s;ervation, experience, rea&s;on and judgment, the&s;e all combined to confirm her in the election &s;he had made; and, on the bo&s;om of &s;erenity, her hours rolled on.</P>
<P>Both the mental and exterior accompli&s;hments of our children were &s;till improving; their mutual at|tachment

<P>Rea&s;on authori&s;es us at this time thus to addre&s;s you; but when once the hallowed hour, that &s;hall witne&s;s your plighted faith, is pa&s;t, the tran&s;action of that hour will be indi&s;&s;oluble!

<P>Thus rolled on the weeks, months, and years, until revolving time produced the promi&s;ed era: It took place in the la&s;t vernal &s;ea&s;on, when the humid &s;teps of April were on the point of re&s;igning their tear gem|med empire to the bland and flowery feet of the wreath crowned and odour breathing month of May. Marga|retta had then ju&s;t rounded her nineteenth year; and, much &s;ooner than would have been our <HI>uninfluenced wi&s;h,</HI> we re&s;igned our lovely charge into the hands of him, who had long been the deliberate choice of her heart.</P>
<P>Arrayed in maje&s;ty &s;erene, the morning broke. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of day a&s;&s;umed to our grateful view an uncommon cheerfulne&s;s&mdash;all nature looked gay&mdash;the flowers &s;eemed ju&s;t expanding with emblematic &s;weetne&s;s&mdash;and the birds carolled mo&s;t divinely.</P>

But though only a &s;elect party were &s;ummoned to partake our felicity, and to gild, by their pre&s;ence, our bridal day, yet we were ambitious of diffu&s;ing the face of gladne&s;s over our village; and we therefore appro|priated the &s;ums which we might have expended in the flowing goblet, and at the fe&s;tal board, to the pre|paring nuptial pre&s;ents for tho&s;e who mourned beneath the iron &s;way of penury, and who, by this well-timed relief, felt their hearts once more attuned to the genial voice of plea&s;ure; who halted to entwine for us the wreath of gratitude, the perfume of which was as the &s;weete&s;t incen&s;e to our &s;ouls; and who, bending at the foot&s;tool of paternal Deity, &s;upplicated Heaven to confer upon us the choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>The bride appeared among us arrayed in &s;potle&s;s white; her robe was a delicate mu&s;lin, drawn in many a flower, from the rich variety of her elegant fancy, and neatly wrought by her own fair hands. She be|held the approach of her wedding day, uncon&s;cious of tho&s;e terrors attributed to her &s;ex. Upon the evening preceding the appointed morning, &s;he entertained us, at our fir&s;t reque&s;t, with many of our favourite airs, upon her piano forte. I did not perceive her heart flying through her bodice! and her tremors being of the governable kind, &s;he was all her own agreeable &s;elf. What pa&s;&s;ed between her and her mother, with whom &s;he retired for a few hours, I am yet to learn; but this I know, that the day it&s;elf was not u&s;hered in either by fits, or any violently agonized emotions. Vir|gin delicacy only &s;erved to animate, to heighten, and to new point the exqui&s;ite beauties which adorn the fine&s;t face I have ever &s;een; and &s;he accompanied us to the altar, where the ceremony was performed, with a &s;ober and cha&s;ti&s;ed expre&s;&s;ion of complacency, which &s;eemed to &s;ay&mdash;<HI>I have taken &s;ufficient time to deliberate&mdash;I am under the direction of my be&s;t friends</HI>&mdash;every &s;en|timent, every pa&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul approves the man who is this day to become my hu&s;band.

For Hamilton, the unbounded rapture which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his bo&s;om, was blended, however, with a dignified and manly manife&s;tation of tenderne&s;s, which &s;erved to tranquillize his deportment, and to pre&s;ent him in a &s;tate of mind becoming the &s;acred rites which were to be performed: Yet, when he received the hand of Margaretta, the big emotions of his bo&s;om refu|&s;ed to be wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed&mdash;"Conde&s;cending excel|lence!" he exclaimed "may He, who thus enriches me, render me worthy of &s;o much goodne&s;s." The cere|mony, excepting this interruption, pa&s;&s;ed agreeably to its &s;acred arrangement; and, after the good Urbanius had pronounced the benediction, we adjourned to our own man&s;ion; and, &s;ince, what halcyon days, weeks and months have revolved! Not a cloud has yet ob|&s;cured our horizon.</P>
<P>La&s;t week, Margaretta pre&s;ented Edward with her fir&s;t born&mdash;it is a male infant. Let me &s;ee&mdash;elev|en months of uninterrupted felicity!! Can this la&s;t? The pre&s;ent is a checkered &s;tate.</P>

<P>But while I confe&s;s an equal, and in &s;ome in&s;tances perhaps a greater degree of culpability, than what I attribute to my neighbour, I may be tolerated in la|menting a frailty, which is common to all, and in an effort to correct, with that <HI>application</HI> and <HI>avidity</HI> prop|er to a <HI>re&s;pon&s;ible</HI> and <HI>probationary</HI> being, the di&s;orders which a&s;&s;ail the intellectual world.</P>

<P>For the &s;oft endearments of their infant progeny, the opening bud of rea&s;on, which was &s;o fondly marked, the intere&s;ting prattle of childhood, the big emotions which &s;welled the parental bo&s;om, as they beheld the forming virtues clu&s;tering in the progre&s;&s;ive mind; for the expan&s;ive joy they experienced, while they wit|ne&s;&s;ed the rapid advancement to an honorary maturi|ty; for the rich completion of felicity which crowned their wi&s;hes, when they beheld their &s;atisfactory and comfortable e&s;tabli&s;hment; for the marked and grate|ful acts of duty, they have continued to receive; for for all the&s;e various &s;cenes of heartfelt good, which for a &s;eries of years have been &s;o richly enjoyed&mdash;they are enumerated, it is true, but not as a balance for the pre&s;|ent evil; far from it&mdash;they only &s;erve to point the poignancy of the di&s;tre&s;sful era, and to &s;well the fea|tures of &s;uch unheard of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Yet it is a fact, that the removal of the&s;e objects of complacency will &s;lope their pa&s;&s;age to that grave in which the good old man and woman mu&s;t lay down; and a reunion with their children, in future worlds, they confidently expect.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that he who thus tacitly or indirectly arraigns the de&s;ignations elanced upon this globe, can believe in the &s;uperintendence of an all-wi&s;e, all-gra|cious, all-powerful and paternal God? Certainly he does. <HI>Thou, Lord, ha&s;t done this,</HI> is a common expre&s;|&s;ion; and yet, &s;trange to tell, he is con&s;tantly found thus cavilling at the di&s;po&s;itions of the Almighty!</P>
<P>Surely it ought to be remembered, that we &s;ee but a part of the immea&s;urable whole; that he who formed the &s;pirit, can give it, in a &s;ingle luxuriant moment, fully to partake an ample compen&s;ation for years of &s;uffering.</P>

Tho&s;e families which are yielded to the hard allot|ments of penurious fortune, experience the mo&s;t lively &s;atisfaction, as often as the flowery feet of bland and genial charity vi&s;it their abodes; they have re&s;ources unknown to the affluent; and highly reli&s;hed is that refection, however homely it may in reality be, which is &s;erved up with the &s;auce of hunger.</P>
<P>Exqui&s;ite is the moment of ea&s;e to the tortured frame; ineffable are the &s;en&s;ations it partakes; and it is well purcha&s;ed by the previous &s;ufferings which are its price. Tho&s;e who have laid their children or other friends in the grave, have perhaps enjoyed them <HI>long,</HI> or <HI>much; "they are not lo&s;t, but gone before,</HI>" and in another, and better &s;tate of exi&s;tence, they &s;hall receive them again. I &s;ay, then, it is more becoming to en|deavour to mitigate the ills of life, than by the routine of complaints to be impiou&s;ly murmuring again&s;t the decrees of Heaven, which mu&s;t indi&s;putably re&s;ult from a righteous and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent arrangement; and I aver, that it is a fal&s;e calculation which makes the <HI>&s;um total of human evils more than that balance,</HI> which, upon a fair and open e&s;timation, would appear at the foot of a regular and well dige&s;ted account, of tho&s;e plea&s;urable or peaceful moments, which are the por|tion of mortality.</P>
<P>But to &s;uch a pitch of infatuated ab&s;urdity has a per|&s;ua&s;ion of the calamities incident to the pre&s;ent &s;tate arrived, that we are ab&s;olutely enjoined to hold lightly the mo&s;t virtuous enjoyments, to be con&s;tantly looking for an evil day, and to tremble when we have attained to the &s;ummit of our wi&s;hes! What would be the feel|ings of that father whom his child &s;hould thus addre&s;s: "I will forbear to take plea&s;ure in the portion with which you have endowed me. I am momently ex|pecting the exertions of your power again&s;t me. I know that the rod of correction is lifted up, and that you mean to cha&s;ti&s;e me. I expect <HI>evil and not good</HI> from your hands; and though you have at pre&s;ent gratified me, by putting me in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the inherit|ance for which I have &s;ighed, yet, as I am confident

<P>I would rather &s;ay, that as I po&s;&s;e&s;s much, I will en|joy much; the <HI>virtuous plea&s;ures</HI> of my &s;oul &s;hall not meet a barrier; freely I will expatiate, nor will I know a boundary, &s;ave what rectitude &s;hall throw around me; the pre&s;ent moment is replete with ble&s;&s;ings, and though the next may intercept &s;ome plea&s;ing view, yet, it is the hand of a Father which will be &s;tretched out, and my ultimate felicity will con&s;equently be con|&s;ulted.</P>
<P>It is well that the Creator, enthroned in maje&s;ty &s;e|rene, is beyond the capability of adopting that mode of conduct, to which repeated provocations would pre|cipitate the lap&s;ed nature; it is well that his ways are not like our ways; it is well that he regardeth with a &s;teady eye the creature which he hath made, and that neither the caprices nor the inquietudes of the children of men, can bend the determined purpo&s;es of his un|changing plans.</P>
<P>I have been &s;hocked when I have heard the rea&s;on for con&s;olation, which is &s;ometimes offered to the child of &s;orrow.&mdash;"You have &s;uffered much," exclaims the commi&s;erating friend, "many are the ills which you have been called to encounter, and doubtle&s;s the pe|riod of retribution, winged by hours and days of &s;miling tranquillity, is at hand." Ah! is it then true that we can challenge the Sire of men and angels, as our debtor! mo&s;t irreverent and impious idea! Surely if our calculations were more accurate, and if we were under the influence of gratitude to the Supreme Being, the genuine breathings of our &s;pirits would be&mdash;In every calamity I have been upheld, and often have I partook the enjoyments of life.

It is true, I have experienced my moments of &s;orrow; but they have been abundantly compen&s;ated by innu|merable felicities, by plea&s;ures &s;carcely marked, and by gratifications now perhaps forgotten.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is beyond a doubt, that much depends upon our efforts to cultivate an equal and acquie&s;cent ar|rangement of the pa&s;&s;ions. We are certainly too prone to be unmindful of benefits, and to &s;well, with cen&s;urable ingenuity, even to a gigantic &s;tature, the ills of life.</P>
<P>The jaundiced eye will create the hue that does not in fact exi&s;t; &s;ources of tormenting anxiety, to the murmuring and ungrateful man, will grow thick upon every bough, while a mind habituated to a retro&s;pect of its privileges and exemptions, will gather, from the &s;ame tree, fruits of the mo&s;t meliorated and delicious flavour. I can hardly conceive of an affliction &s;o complicated, as to drive upon the tumultuous waves of de&s;pair, the &s;pirit upon which fortitude hath im|pre&s;&s;ed its image.</P>
<P>The firmly virtuous man will indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;eek the means of con&s;olation; when &s;tripped of all el&s;e, he will float buoyant upon the &s;trong plank of re&s;olution; he will revert to the good which is pa&s;t; he will re|member the fluctuating &s;cenes of the pre&s;ent &s;tate; he will recollect the character of the Sovereign Di&s;po&s;er of events; and he will po&s;&s;e&s;s light &s;ufficient to &s;hape his weather-beaten prop, even upon the trackle&s;s deep. But how often are the&s;e proper and dignified exertions rever&s;ed! The mind which is debilitated by enervat|ing pur&s;uits and irrational hopes, which hath formed
<PB N="144" REF="034162_0143_0FFC6299E8E803F0">
the mo&s;t elevated e&s;timation of <HI>its own de&s;erts,</HI> and which hath con&s;equently plumed its expectation to the highe&s;t pitch; &s;uch a mind, even in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t happy arrangement, finds it&s;elf a prey to di&s;ap|pointment and di&s;gu&s;t; though &s;urrounded by almo&s;t every enjoyment, its feelings are palled, and it experi|ences all the di&s;agreeables of &s;atiety; a &s;tranger to moderation, and unble&s;t by contentment, although marked by &s;ucce&s;s, and crowned by the completion of many hopes, it is, neverthele&s;s, langui&s;hing under the domination of murmuring inquietude; often it accu&s;es its God of inju&s;tice; and it is frequently found exclaim|ing&mdash;"If I am not, in future worlds, to be rewarded for my &s;ufferings in this, it would have been better I had never known a being!"</P>
<P>We do inju&s;tice to our&s;elves, when we &s;upinely de|clare, that all this is wholly con&s;titutional; that it de|pends merely upon the mechani&s;m of the mind; and that per&s;ons are born with a yielding, equal, and cheer|ful di&s;po&s;ition, or with a refractory, peevi&s;h, ungrateful, and gloomy temper of &s;oul: This general a&s;&s;ertion may be convenient for the indolent; but tho&s;e who a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivate the virtues, and endeavour to ex|terminate the offending propen&s;ities, which together grow in the &s;oil of their own bo&s;oms, while they allow &s;omething to nature, will al&s;o acknowledge, that much depends upon the unwearied and uniform exertions, which it is certainly incumbent upon every child of mortality to make.</P>
<P>If the phy&s;iognomi&s;t ju&s;tly delineated the mind of Socrates, as that incomparable philo&s;opher a&s;&s;ures us he did, we are thus furni&s;hed with an illu&s;trious proof of the ine&s;timable acquirements which depend upon, and are produced by, the admini&s;tration of rea&s;on. In truth, there is a &s;weet pliability in the mind of man, which can familiarize it even with &s;orrow; ac|commodating and acquie&s;cent, cu&s;tom habituates and almo&s;t reconciles us to grief; we bend beneath the bur&s;ting &s;torm; and though, with the elegant and ex|qui&s;itely &s;u&s;ceptible Philenia, we may "<HI>fling the lorn

pathos to the pa&s;&s;ing gale,</HI>" yet, becoming experimentally acquainted with the <HI>charms</HI> of <HI>melancholy,</HI> we &s;hall not fail, with that beautiful and plaintive mourner, to gem our &s;orrows with a brightening tear.</P>
<P>A friend of mine was once in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of affluence, &s;urrounded by friends; he &s;eemed the favourite of fortune; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that the means of em|bracing his utmo&s;t wi&s;hes re&s;ted wholly with him&s;elf; yet vexatious inquietude &s;eemed the motto of his life; and a prey to chagrin, amid his ample endowments, he hardly ever ta&s;ted the felicity of a tranquil mo|ment! But my friend, by various accidents, was reduced to a &s;tate of penury; and I have, in that &s;it|uation, heard him declare without the &s;malle&s;t appear|ance of affectation, even when the la&s;t mor&s;el he could command was produced upon his &s;canty board, that he felt contented and grateful, experiencing that ac|quie&s;cence in the allotments of Providence, and tho&s;e agreeable anticipations of futurity, to which he had been a &s;tranger, in tho&s;e days which had been regard|ed as the epoch of his pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>In fact, it is amid the clouds which adver&s;ity throws around the child of mortality, that the efforts of the mind are called forth, and that all the energetic pow|ers of the &s;oul are formed to action; and it is al&s;o ir|refragably true, that heart-felt enjoyments depend al|together upon the cultivation of a philanthropic &s;pirit, upon cheri&s;hing &s;entiments of general complacency in the economy of Deity, in our&s;elves and others, and in thus embodying (if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf) the vir|tues of the mind.</P>
<P>I have at this moment my eye upon two gentle|men, whom I have per&s;onally known almo&s;t from their infancy; they are the &s;ons of one man and woman; their education was the &s;ame; their hopes and fears were &s;imilar; and they commenced the ca|reer of bu&s;ine&s;s with like e&s;tabli&s;hments, like advan|tages, and like expectations.</P>
<P>Early in life they were both united to de&s;erving females, to females apparently of their choice; and
<PB N="146" REF="034162_0145_0FFC6294DABBDB58">
they were thus furni&s;hed with every incitement to vir|tuous per&s;everance; while the avenues to rational en|joyment were thrown open before them, and the tran|quillity of their days &s;eemed in&s;ured.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time, fortune, liberal of her favours, acted the part of an impartial parent, di&s;tributing her emol|uments with an equal hand; but her various di&s;po&s;i|tions at length predominating, the &s;imilitude of her operations was no more.</P>
<P>Placidius, the elde&s;t of tho&s;e gentlemen, experienced her frowns; the tide of &s;ucce&s;s began to turn; mi&s;|fortunes &s;ucceeded each other; and without the &s;had|ow of a rea&s;on, upon which to ground the &s;malle&s;t im|peachment of his integrity, or a &s;ingle circum&s;tance, upon which even malevolence could call in que&s;tion his abilities, he beheld his affairs irretrievably embar|ra&s;&s;ed, his be&s;t laid plans fru&s;trated, and him&s;elf advan|cing rapidly to that &s;tate of in&s;olvency, which his up|right &s;oul, glowing with a ju&s;t and high &s;en&s;e of prob|ity, deprecated as a mo&s;t aggravated evil. Gradually the means of bu&s;ine&s;s vani&s;hed out of his hands; his &s;tock in trade was no more; and even the commodious man&s;ion, which with much ingenuity and ta&s;te, though with a proper attention to frugality, he had reared, with the hope that it would &s;till remain in his family, even this habitation became the property of his creditors!</P>
<P>Placidius had ever expre&s;&s;ed a great de&s;ire to per|petuate him&s;elf in his lineal de&s;cendants; and this nat|ural wi&s;h, might in him be de&s;ignated as his ruling pa&s;&s;ion: but many revolving &s;ea&s;ons pa&s;&s;ed, ere Placi|dius hailed the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes in this re&s;|pect; and when at la&s;t, his Matilda pre&s;ented him with her fir&s;t born &s;on, the chalice of joy which he had but lifted to his lips, was da&s;hed from his gra&s;p, by the &s;udden death of an infant upon who&s;e little form the traces of longevity &s;eemed in&s;cribed. For this &s;troke he was wholly unprepared; and, to complete his cat|alogue of evils, his bo&s;om friend, his long loved, and ever e&s;teemed Matilda&mdash;even at a life &s;o precious, the king of terrors too &s;urely aimed his mi&s;&s;ive &s;hafts! the
<PB N="147" REF="034162_0146_0FFC62927701DD08">
icy darts of <HI>indulged &s;orrow</HI> found their way to the vi|tal &s;tream of life, and, congealing the purple flow, the virtuous and accompli&s;hed Matilda was numbered with the dead.</P>
<P>Placidius now felt as a man; his rea&s;on was the forfeit; and the hour which re&s;tored this regent to her accu&s;tomed operations, only gave her to witne&s;s the melancholy void in a mind which had once been the feat of expectations bland and cheering, and which had been enriched by every white winged hope, which rectitude could authori&s;e. Recollection, gloomy recol|lection returned; dreadful was the contra&s;t with the <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> which the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> exhibited! Placidius &s;hrunk from the view; his health became the &s;acrifice, and for many months he &s;eemed to langui&s;h through all the different &s;tages of a gradual and unyielding de|cline. Fortitude, however, was at la&s;t triumphant; a calm, and rational tranquillity &s;ucceeded the &s;ub|&s;iding tumults which had agitated his &s;oul. The re&s;toration of the health of Placidius, was the happy con&s;equence of this change; and he reflected as be|came a man, a philo&s;opher, and a religioni&s;t.</P>
<P>Fortune, too, &s;o far relented as to put it in the power of Placidius to reimbur&s;e his creditors; and he was inve&s;ted with the means of procuring for him&s;elf a competency. It is true the &s;plendour of his former pro&s;pects can never be re&s;tored; but Placidius is con|tented. "I cannot," &s;aid he the other day, "regard life as an evil: I &s;hould be mo&s;t ungrateful, did I not own, that to me it hath been more fruitful of plea&s;ure than of pain. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that for a time I &s;unk beneath the agonizing &s;troke; for a time I was wretched! it is true that the bla&s;ting of tho&s;e pre|&s;umptuous hopes, which I had arrogantly formed for the meridian of my days, rendered me beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion mi&s;erable; but my youth was &s;erenely hap|py; <HI>for a great length of time</HI> I enjoyed the mo&s;t plea&s;|ing pro&s;pects; and though I have laid the wife of my bo&s;om in the grave, yet delicious are the tears which I now &s;hed to her memory; and in the faire&s;t pages
<PB N="148" REF="034162_0147_0FFC628FF4CAF038">
of retention, are trea&s;ured up the days, months, and years, during which I partook with her the highe&s;t &s;tate of felicity, which can fall to the lot of mortality, which can be experienced this &s;ide that paradi&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ed, where I &s;hall again meet the virtuous com|panion, in who&s;e faithful bo&s;om I repo&s;ed the fonde&s;t hopes and wi&s;hes of which my being was capable; where I &s;hall be reunited to a Matilda ever blooming, ever immortal&mdash;united too, by ties which will be then indi&s;&s;oluble. And though no &s;on or daughter will gem my parting moments with a filial tear, yet the family of mankind is wide, the children of my adoption are many&mdash;from one &s;ource we originated, and my bo&s;om feels and owns the great fraternity.</P>
<P>For Agetius, the brother of Placidius, we need &s;carce do more than rever&s;e the picture. In one even tide of pro&s;perity his commercial tran&s;actions have glided on; or if a trifling lo&s;s hath &s;ometimes origin|ated a cloud, his &s;ub&s;equent gains, by pre&s;enting abun|dant compen&s;ation, hath &s;peedily di&s;&s;ipated it: As a merchant he is e&s;tabli&s;hed; his trade is lucrative; eve|ry year enriches him; he hath lately completed an elegant dwelling; and the amiable and gentle Anna &s;till remains the &s;ocial partner of his days. His &s;on and daughter po&s;&s;e&s;s plea&s;ing exteriors, and improving minds; he hath educated them agreeably to plans which he deliberately formed, and they will &s;oon take rank with the fir&s;t young people of their circle. Age|tius hath &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uninterrupted cour&s;e of health; and no per&s;on can recollect any &s;erious mi&s;|fortune which, as an individual, he hath been called to &s;uffer&mdash;yet Agetius always appears anxious, and even perturbed; <HI>he &s;eems fearful le&s;t you &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e him enjoying a &s;ingle good</HI>&mdash;he will not acknowledge a tran|quil moment&mdash;"<HI>no one can &s;o well &s;ay where the &s;hoe pinches, as him who wears it,</HI>" is an adage frequently in his mouth; and he &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ionately declares that he wi&s;hes he had never been born!</P>
<P>I &s;aid that I conceived &s;uch manife&s;tations of in|gratitude peculiar to man; and &s;urely, as far as we
<PB N="149" REF="034162_0148_0FFC628DB2F8ACF0">
can ob&s;erve, the children of in&s;tinct fail not to <HI>enjoy</HI> the good which they po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>In the early days of Placidius and Agetius their minds di&s;covered, to common ob&s;ervation, no e&s;&s;en|tial difference. One remark I have however gleaned: Agetius, when a boy, attempted not to re&s;train a haughty, choleric and unrea&s;onable ambition, which might be common to both; and his little heart &s;welled with indignation, as often as he encountered a &s;uperi|or, in any of tho&s;e advantages, which are calculated to captivate the inexperienced eye. Upon the&s;e occa|&s;ions, his brother was ever at hand, to pre&s;ent the mir|ror of rea&s;on; and he hath often been heard to &s;ay&mdash;"Turn, my dear Agetius&mdash;turn thine eyes to the mul|titude below thee, and from thence let thy compari&s;ons be rai&s;ed; a&s;pire not to &s;uch dangerous heights, but learn to e&s;timate properly thy own exemptions, thy own privileges, and to cultivate complacency in that happy mediocrity which is allotted thee."</P>
<P>Placidius early habituated him&s;elf to commune with his own heart; he had a &s;erious turn, and was fond of u&s;eful information; he endeavoured to moderate his de&s;ires, and to entwine, <HI>with every arrangement, the ble&s;|&s;ings of contentment;</HI> he aimed at regulating his pa&s;&s;ions, at obtaining a due &s;ubordination in the intellectual &s;y&s;|tem; and his plan was, to reduce every movement of his &s;oul, and every action of his life, to the domination of <HI>rea&s;on, irradiated by genuine religion.</HI></P>

The fir&s;t which I &s;hall point out, (which is, I confe&s;s, the lea&s;t commanding) is the contracted &s;pirit which their <HI>practice</HI> not &s;eldom evinces in the <HI>irrational partiality</HI> they di&s;cover to men of their own de&s;cription; whereas, if the advantages of a brother are as great as is in&s;inuated, an <HI>unworthy ma&s;on</HI> &s;hould take rank in the lowe&s;t grade of mankind.</P>
<P>I know that ma&s;ons make very pompous profe&s;&s;ions of philanthropy, and that the broad expan&s;ive glow, the ties which bind the univer&s;al brotherhood, is full often the theme of their lectures. "Upon the unalter|able region of nature," &s;ay they "our mo&s;t ancient and honourable fraternity is e&s;tabli&s;hed. As this can never be invalidated, di&s;annulled, or made void; &s;o neither can the obligations that render this exten&s;ive &s;ociety indi&s;&s;oluble ever be aboli&s;hed or in the &s;malle&s;t degree violated by &s;uch as walk in the light of ma&s;on|ry. They that occupy the&s;e man&s;ions of truth, unity and joy, which the royal craft has furni&s;hed for <HI>&s;ocial</HI> delight, may as well annihilate them&s;elves, as by the lea&s;t oblique direction to deviate from the &s;quare of integrity, <HI>in any imaginable ratio to dimini&s;h the circle of benevolence;</HI> or in the &s;malle&s;t in&s;tance to fail of laying righteou&s;ne&s;s to the line, and judgment to the plum|met."</P>
<P>All this is very fine; and if realized, it would in|deed prove the magnificent theatre of &s;implicity, which they boa&s;t they are employed in rearing, to be founded in the mo&s;t &s;plendid region of the orient beam; and we might in truth expect to &s;ee, in <HI>real characters upon this my&s;terious &s;tage, all the graces and virtues that ble&s;s and adorn human nature. The exhibitions upon this theatre would doubtle&s;s in&s;pire the mo&s;t rapturous compla|cency; and the beholder could not but rejoice, as he marked

the kindred &s;treams of devotion and philanthropy, refre&s;hing the gardens of paradi&s;e, and rein&s;tating mankind in that felicity for which the race was fir&s;t created, and to which it is a&s;&s;erted the royal laws of ma&s;onry are infallibly cal|culated to re&s;tore them:</HI> But rhap&s;ody apart; who does not know, that example hath ever taken the lead, in <HI>point of utility,</HI> of the faire&s;t precepts? Yet I repeat that the <HI>appropriation of benefits to a &s;elect party,</HI> is not that commanding or di&s;tingui&s;hing trait in the craft of which I <HI>principally</HI> complain; for it is undoubtedly true, that although this <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> di&s;po&s;ition is very con&s;picuou&s;ly marked in the conduct of the a&s;&s;ociates of the Lodge, it is not, however, peculiarly ma&s;onic; &s;ince it more or le&s;s characterizes every detached body of men, pervading even the mo&s;t liberal codes, and thru&s;ting its forbidding front into every congregated &s;ociety, enlightened combination, or &s;ect of benevo|lence.</P>
<P>But the grand di&s;criminating peculiarity which I have particularly in view, and which I have regarded as objectionable, is that impenetrable veil of &s;ecrecy, they affect to draw over their proceedings. Rea&s;on, di&s;engaged from the thin bandeau, with which they a&s;&s;ay to hoodwink her, naturally interrogates&mdash;If the in&s;titution con&s;i&s;ts with rectitude, and is replete with that &s;alutary influence attributed thereto, why limit its operations within &s;uch narrow bounds? Why cir|cum&s;cribe, either by compa&s;s or &s;quare, the progre&s;s of genuine utility? Why not throw open the doors to inve&s;tigation? Why not freely communicate? and, unlocking the trea&s;ury of knowledge which they may have accumulated, encourage tho&s;e, who&s;e abilities are adequate, to new light their lamps at a flame &s;o refulgent and &s;o unextingui&s;hable? Who can &s;ay, what &s;uch an event might produce; what flowers might &s;pring up; what &s;cientific di&s;coveries might be made, if, like that <HI>impartial</HI> orb who&s;e face of fire dec|orates and dignifies the ma&s;onic in&s;ignia, the lights they have obtained, were to become generally diffu&s;ive, extending their genial countenance, and powerful pat|ronage

to the meritorious of every age, <HI>&s;ex,</HI> and de&s;crip|tion? Thus far rea&s;on. And &s;hould ma&s;onic &s;uperiori|ty be once more urged; &s;hould it be, as heretofore, again a&s;&s;erted, that the my&s;teries of the <HI>royal craft</HI> are too &s;acred for the uncon&s;ecrated or vulgar eye; holy <HI>truth, which ought to be the rule of &s;peech, as well as action, and every principle of &s;elf complacency, which is confe&s;&s;edly coincident with benevolence,</HI> will reluct at the very idea of &s;ub&s;cribing to a conce&s;&s;ion &s;o humiliating; and the atrocious deviations and paucity of intrin&s;ic worth, or apparent re&s;pectability, &s;ometimes exhibited in the char|acter of the free and accepted ma&s;on, will look with a very unfriendly a&s;pect upon every attempt to hallow his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Perhaps, in this levelling age, which &s;eems to be marked as the era for de&s;troying all arrogant di&s;tinc|tions, the period is not far di&s;tant which may throw down every &s;eparating barrier, which may annihilate every ari&s;tocratic elevation, and the terms <HI>wor&s;hipful</HI> and <HI>right wor&s;hipful</HI> may &s;ound as di&s;cordant upon the democratic ear of knowledge, as that of monarch, prince, or duke, upon the auditory never of the politi|cal hero. The literary or the ma&s;onic world may hear the voice of liberty; in the empire of arts a Thomas Paine may ari&s;e; and we may chance to hear of a <HI>cide|vant grand ma&s;ter,</HI> who may then be content to relin|qui&s;h this high &s;ounding title, for a more humble and equal appellation; the avenues to the goal of wi&s;dom, being widely expanded, proficients of every de&s;crip|tion may throng her ample courts, and to every member of the mental <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> the road to lite|rary honours may be alike open.</P>
<P>But, to be &s;erious&mdash;for in fact, while thus engaged in the routine of my occupation, I have, almo&s;t without de&s;ign, wandered through the gate of an enclo&s;ure, which the owners have been careful to guard from the approaches of every Gleaner, and at which it was my purpo&s;e but barely to glance; I confe&s;s, that in thus trifling, I appear rather the incon&s;iderable idler, than that careful and pains taking being, who is in|du&s;triou&s;ly

<P>It is not my de&s;ign to retail the various opinions formed of your writings in this place, nor even to ex|pre&s;s my own &s;entiments thereof; for I have been, for

many years, an irreconcileable enemy to the cu&s;tom of prai&s;ing a man to his face; nay, I have not to charge my&s;elf, &s;ince I could write man, with any thing like adulation, even to a woman, who&s;e under&s;tanding I have conceived one tenth part of a degree above par. No, Mr. Gleaner, nothing of all this; and had you been ten times more excellent than you are, though I &s;hould have continued reading you with much avidity, yet, had I not a communication to make, which I have long with much impatience expected to &s;ee i&s;&s;u|ing from the pre&s;s, and which I think will figure, mo&s;t meritoriou&s;ly, in the annals of benevolence,&mdash;my pen would have &s;till continued dormant.</P>
<P>Regarding you as a man, in who&s;e mental compo|&s;ition the milk of human kindne&s;s redundantly flows, I have for &s;ome months formed the de&s;ign of u&s;hering my little narrative to public view, through the channel of your paper; but ob&s;erving you engaged in a regu|lar detail, I have waited until you have conducted your account to a convenient pau&s;e; not thinking it proper, or even entertaining a wi&s;h, to interrupt you in the mid&s;t of &s;uch intere&s;ting occurrences; but learn|ing by your la&s;t number, which I peru&s;ed a few even|ings &s;ince, that you have for the pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pended your dome&s;tic &s;ketches, and wi&s;hing very &s;incerely, that your Margaretta may figure as plea&s;ingly in the character of a matron, as &s;he has in that of a daughter, I ha&s;ten to execute my purpo&s;e, le&s;t I &s;hould not be in time for an exhibition in the pre&s;ent month.</P>
<P>I experience not the &s;malle&s;t apprehen&s;ion, that the anecdote I am about to furni&s;h, will be viewed by the general eye as trivial or indifferent.

that it is very ill judged, to render the dimen&s;ions of the portal more &s;pacious than the building, I &s;hall therefore come immediately to the point.</P>
<P>Captain Mayhew, a very worthy and re&s;pectable inhabitant of this town, and who is al&s;o a navigator of con&s;iderable merit, hath for &s;ome time been employed in the whale fi&s;hery, by Captain David Pearce, a very u&s;eful and enterpri&s;ing merchant, in the town of Glouce&s;ter, commonly called Cape-Ann. He was lately on his return from a whaling voyage, which had been uncommonly prolonged, &s;inking under a &s;curvy of a mo&s;t alarming and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing nature. That truly &s;hocking di&s;order, &s;o afflicting in its con&s;equences to the hardy &s;ons of the ocean, &s;eizing him with every indication of a fatal termination, he was reduced to the mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation; the &s;eamen too, were all langui&s;hing under the melancholy effects of this debilitating and mind affecting malady; and there was hardly ability left with a &s;ingle man, to di&s;charge the duties which were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their common exi&s;tence. Captain Mayhew was de&s;titute of every thing, which could be con&s;idered as a &s;pecific, in this cruel di&s;ea&s;e; and the &s;alted or dried meat, which they were obliged to &s;wallow, hourly adding to the evil, gave it the mo&s;t frightful appearance. Thus, in effect di&s;abled, he was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of putting into the i&s;land of St. Helena.</P>
<P>As the i&s;land of St. Helena is a domain of the Briti&s;h crown, and as Captain Mayhew was a &s;ubject of an American republic, &s;o recently e&s;teemed a rebel|lious, and now a di&s;membered territory, the probabil|ity was that the rights of ho&s;pitality would be but <HI>&s;paringly</HI> exerci&s;ed toward him; and it was only the urgency of his condition, that determined him to flee for &s;uccour to &s;o que&s;tionable a port.</P>
<P>It happened for &s;ome time previous to the arrival of Captain Mayhew at St. Helena, that the fertilizing &s;howers had been withheld, and the in&s;ufferable blaze of day, &s;o genial when qualified by their bland and humid influence, now &s;pread over the face of nature a &s;ick|ening
<PB N="156" REF="034162_0155_0FFC627D5D5ADCB0">
and deathful hue; the thir&s;ty earth vi&s;ibly mourned the continuity of its inten&s;e and gairi&s;h rays; no &s;ilvery dews be&s;pangled her now yellow mantle; her once velvet covering became parched and heathy; the green vegetable lifted not its head, while even the &s;tinted growth which the ground, thus circum&s;tanced, produced, were by this melancholy drought cut &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;hort, as to yield the inhab|itants but a &s;canty and even penurious &s;upport. This intelligence was as a death warrant to Captain May|hew and his company; the fruits of the earth were become indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to their exi&s;tence; it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to procure them, and they viewed death as inevitable.</P>
<P>Daniel Corneille, E&s;q. was at that time (and for the benefit of human nature, unle&s;s he is removed to a more exten&s;ive &s;phere of operation, I tru&s;t that he &s;till is) governor of the i&s;land, and Henry Brooks, E&s;q. deputy-governor. I confe&s;s I take a &s;uperior plea&s;ure in penning the names of tho&s;e philanthropic gentle|men; and if the general tenor of their lives corre&s;|ponds with their conduct to Captain Mayhew and his comrades, I pronounce, that both their names, and acts of liberality, ought to be engraved "by the con|centred rays of the &s;un, upon the azure &s;urface of the heavens."</P>
<P>The governor's private gardens, and grounds of every de&s;cription, were irrigated by means of aque|ducts, which conveyed the water &s;everal leagues, from tho&s;e immen&s;e re&s;ervoirs, the mountains; and in con|&s;equence of being thus plentifully accommodated by the fructifying &s;treams, the vegetable productions of nature revelled there, in all the pride and vigour of a healthy and rich maturity; the hand of &s;kilful and a&s;&s;iduous culture had been regularly employed; and in addition to the perfection of the plants, the mo&s;t lux|uriant abundance laughed around.</P>
<P>How many there are, who would have re&s;erved the ripened fruit of &s;uch unremitted care for them&s;elves, or for others of their own de&s;cription? How many
<PB N="157" REF="034162_0156_0FFC627A17594F68">
there are, who would have trembled at the very idea of admitting a number of &s;trangers, of a grade, too, not accu&s;tomed to regularity, into grounds laid out by the hand of judgment, combined with the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite ta&s;te, and kept with a very exact attention to order? How few there are, who would have &s;ought out the <HI>di&s;ea&s;ed captain of an ob&s;cure whaleman, and his unpoli&s;hed a&s;&s;ociates!</HI> But governor Corneille and his deputy are <HI>citizens&mdash;they are citizens of the univer&s;e;</HI> and it appears that they are perfectly ver&s;ed in the rights of humanity.</P>
<P>To their beautiful gardens, Captain Mayhew, with the re&s;t of the &s;ick, were conducted; they were au|thorized to make an unre&s;trained u&s;e of the nece&s;&s;aries with which they were &s;tored, and a free acce&s;s was at all times granted them! The &s;ick and debilitated &s;ea|men &s;trolled at plea&s;ure there; under the wide &s;pread|ing tree, upon mo&s;&s;y &s;eats they reclined; or, &s;tretching them&s;elves in the foliage crowned arbour, as they &s;lum|bered upon the enamelled gra&s;s, they inhaled the &s;alu|brious breeze, which, richly impregnated with the re&s;torative effluvia, collected from a thou&s;and health|ful &s;ources, new &s;trung their nerves, pre&s;ented the &s;ove|reign panacea, communicating to the life &s;tream, which had moved with morbid and &s;low paced languor, the animating and &s;prightly glow, thus bequeathing to the whole &s;y&s;tem returning agility. The tall, finely formed and white grooved celery; the medicinal wa|ter-cre&s;&s;es, with every other anti&s;corbutic, with benev|olent avidity were plentifully furni&s;hed; and when, by the&s;e &s;alutary means, &s;uch a mea&s;ure of &s;trength was obtained, as to enable them to pur&s;ue, with renovated &s;pirit and returning alacrity, a voyage which Capt. Mayhew was ardent to terminate; by the &s;ame lib|eral hands they were amply &s;upplied with every veg|etable, and other requi&s;ite, which could be procured in the i&s;land of St. Helena.</P>
<P>It is, I conceive, hardly nece&s;&s;ary to add, that both the governor, and deputy-governor, di&s;dained a pe|cuniary reward. The truly philanthropic man, con|&s;cious
<PB N="158" REF="034162_0157_0FFC62779011F3E0">
that he is amply repaid by the feelings of his own heart for every benevolent action, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth too much integrity to accept a &s;econd recompen&s;e; and I have only fervidly to wi&s;h, that the Corneille's, and the Brooks's, of every age and country, may &s;till find them&s;elves, from &s;o rich and exhau&s;tle&s;s a &s;ource, re|imbur&s;ed for every humane and benign interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed as if Capt. Mayhew, who was &s;till in a degree enfeebled by the effects of his di&s;order, had ob|tained the particular patronage of &s;ome powerfully propitious invi&s;ible, who&s;e agency was employed in cau&s;ing the &s;ons of philanthropy to pa&s;s in review be|fore him. As he proceeded in his cour&s;e, cro&s;&s;ing the equator, he met with &s;everal European &s;hips, making their homeward pa&s;&s;age from a We&s;t-India voyage. By the commander of one of tho&s;e &s;hips, who was a de&s;cendant of the Gallic nation, (and right &s;orry am I, good Mr. Gleaner, that I cannot give you his name) he was hailed, who finding him a &s;ufferer from a malady &s;o common to &s;eamen in long voyages, mo&s;t generou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on his accepting wines, cordials, vegetables, and live &s;tock, to a very con&s;iderable amount; and when Capt. Mayhew ventured ju&s;t to hint at the propriety of his receiving &s;ome kind of compen&s;ation, <HI>this humane Frenchman</HI> nobly, liberally, and in the true &s;pirit of <HI>cidevant</HI> French politene&s;s, replied, "<HI>Pardonez moi, Mon&s;ieur;</HI> my whole &s;hip and cargo, were they nece&s;&s;ary to your relief, &s;hould, I a&s;&s;ure you, be at your &s;ervice."</P>
<P>What truly complacent &s;en&s;ations, mu&s;t gladden the expanded heart, as it contemplates remote indi|viduals, de&s;cendants of the &s;ame &s;tock, when acciden|tally collected, thus benignly engaged in the exerci&s;e of good offices; thus benevolently contributing to the relief of their fellow men. But, Sir, I invade not your province; many a &s;cattered reflection you will doubtle&s;s glean; while I, &s;atisfied with having publi&s;h|ed this te&s;timony of the gratitude of my town&s;man, Capt.

<P>I HAVE &s;ometimes been induced to think, after a &s;erious attempt to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es which have operated in the production of &s;o many needy de|pendents of both &s;exes, upon the bounty of, or civil requi&s;itions made upon, the more &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;y&s;tem|atic or indu&s;trious members of the community; that the origin of this prevalent evil may generally, with a very few exceptions, be traced to that luxuriant &s;ource of folly, an unwarrantable, and irrational kind of pride, or fal&s;e notions of gentility. Parents, in a certain line, either educate their &s;ons with a view to one of the three learned profe&s;&s;ions, to a pur&s;uit of the fine arts, or, apprenticing them to the merchant, or &s;ea-faring adventurer, conceive they have placed them in the road, which will mo&s;t probably terminate in crowning them with opulence and re&s;pectability.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly for the intere&s;t of &s;ociety, that a con&s;iderable proportion of our young people &s;hould
<PB N="162" REF="034162_0161_0FFC626E2B5D5568">
be thus appropriated; but when it becomes evident that any particular department is over&s;tocked, a wi&s;e father ought certainly to turn his attention to tho&s;e branches of bu&s;ine&s;s, which, by being le&s;s occupied, give the youthful candidate a fairer chance of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing him&s;elf of that competency, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upporting <HI>real dignity</HI> of character. But gen|tlemen who con&s;titute the particular grade to which I advert, look with di&s;dain upon every handicraft occu|pation; the whole routine of arts mechanic, or, in other words, u&s;eful employments, they regard with &s;overeign contempt; and they would e&s;teem their &s;ons degraded beyond redemption, if they de&s;ignated them by any one of tho&s;e callings, which have been appel|lated &s;ervile. I will ju&s;t hazard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> que&s;tion, relative to the propriety of the conjugation, which places <HI>&s;ervile</HI> as the adjective of mechanic. Doth not that man bid the faire&s;t for <HI>genuine independence,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in him|&s;elf the means, whenever he choo&s;es to call his indu&s;|trious application into action, of &s;upplying him&s;elf <HI>even from the wants of others,</HI> with the nece&s;&s;aries of life? And if &s;o, is not the above mentioned <HI>attempt at approximation</HI> extremely heterogeneous?</P>
<P>Prejudices &s;o ab&s;urd are particularly ludicrous in a government, the genius of which is, to cultivate as great a degree of equality as will con&s;i&s;t with the requi&s;ite order and well being of the Commonwealth; and yet, &s;trange to tell, perhaps there is no part of the world, where the&s;e unnatural di&s;tinctions, &s;o humiliating to the mechanic, and &s;o elevating to the <HI>&s;uppo&s;itious</HI> gentleman, are &s;o prevalent, or exi&s;t more forcibly, than in &s;ome of the&s;e American States; and, however obvious it may be, that the predominating bent, or predilection, with which nature may have endowed the boy, ought to claim &s;ome &s;hare in the determina|tion; it is, neverthele&s;s, irrevocably decreed, <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> mu&s;t be prepared to fill a <HI>gentleman like &s;phere;</HI> and though it is very po&s;&s;ible, that not a &s;hilling of prop|erty may be re&s;erved for his commencing the career of bu&s;ine&s;s; yet, however <HI>below a mediocrity</HI> his talen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">

During the hours of childhood, by arrangements the mo&s;t ill judged, an undue exaltation is cheri&s;hed; by degrees he becomes habituated to con&s;ider him&s;elf as &s;uperior to various cla&s;&s;es of his fellow men; his adole&s;cence is pa&s;&s;ed in frivolous pur&s;uits, and if his maturity is &s;upine, indo|lent, or de&s;titute of enterpri&s;e; if he wants genius, which is a gem as rare as e&s;timable, or even if he is un&s;ucce&s;sful, or unfortunate, (and who does not know that merit cannot always command its wi&s;hes?) he is, of nece&s;&s;ity, thrown a u&s;ele&s;s burden upon the public.</P>
<P>I &s;aid the probability was, that the&s;e unju&s;tifiable prejudices, were more particularly the growth of the American world, than of any other &s;oil; and I have hazarded this conjecture, from the compari&s;on I have been led to make, between a variety of <HI>facts</HI> that have pa&s;&s;ed under my own ob&s;ervation, and the records of other nations.</P>
<P>"A printer!" &s;aid a young &s;pruce coxcomb, who po&s;&s;ibly might have had the honour to &s;tand be|hind a counter, and who was fortuitou&s;ly jumbled into the &s;tage-coach with Mr. Bache, as it performed its tour of duty through a part of Penn&s;ylvania&mdash;"A printer!" and, drawing him&s;elf up into a corner of the vehicle, with a &s;upercilious air, he maintained an ob&s;tinate &s;ilence during the remainder of a journey, which having, previous to his learning the occupation of young Bache, conceived, from his appearance, a high idea of his importance, he had commenced with <HI>in&s;ignificant volubility;</HI> but he was ignorant that he with whom he journeyed, was the lineal de&s;cendant of the immortal Franklin; otherwi&s;e, it may fairly be inferred, that the eclat of his birth, might, in the opin|ion of this &s;uperficial Billy Varni&s;h, have atoned for the mechanical complexion of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A quondam acquaintance of mine, who is a mer|chant, not extremely remarkable for the moderation of his de&s;ires to accumulate gain, was, &s;ome months

&s;ince, on the verge of &s;uffering very con&s;iderably, from the undue influence of this very prejudice. He had appointed an intelligent young man to the command of a &s;hip of his, during a long and intricate voyage. It happened, in the cour&s;e of the navigation which the Captain was directed to pur&s;ue, that he found him&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to put into a port in England, at a di&s;tance from the metropolis. A variety of circum&s;tances contributed to produce, in the affairs entru&s;ted to his care, a very embarra&s;&s;ing and di&s;agreeable event. He was compelled to depart full &s;peed for London, while his &s;hip continued at anchor in Liverpool. An hone&s;t gentleman, with whom he had commenced an intimacy upon the Albion coa&s;t, gave him a letter to a trunk-maker in the capital, who, he informed him, was capable of doing him great &s;ervice. <HI>A trunk-maker! how, in the name of common &s;en&s;e, &s;hould a trunk-maker be in&s;trumental in effectuating any important pur|po&s;e?</HI> A deci&s;ion upon the Captain's bu&s;ine&s;s remain|ed with the high court of admiralty; <HI>could a trunk-maker influence the determinations of that augu&s;t body?</HI> The &s;uppo&s;ition was ridiculous; it could never obtain the &s;malle&s;t degree of attention <HI>in the &s;erious reflections of an American.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain proceeded &s;y&s;tematically; he applied to a certain commercial gentleman, well known in America, and who&s;e exten&s;ive exports to this new world, &s;upply many of our capital dealers with large quantities of European commodities: By this re&s;pecta|ble auxiliary, he was introduced to the American con|&s;ul re&s;ident in Great-Britain, and the mo&s;t favourable repre&s;entation that truth could authori&s;e, was made. The con&s;ul, however, received him rather roughly. Fatigued, perhaps, by a multiplicity of applications, he &s;eemed not di&s;po&s;ed to interpo&s;e his good offices, in order to promote an accommodation of the difficulty; he in&s;i&s;ted much upon the ill conduct of American &s;eamen, and ob&s;erved that if they per&s;i&s;ted in thus careles&s;ly involving them&s;elves in ambiguities, and in flying in the face of tho&s;e adju&s;tments, which had been
<PB N="165" REF="034162_0164_0FFC6266C2AAA1E8">
legally made, they mu&s;t extricate them&s;elves as they could, or be contented to &s;ubmit to the con&s;equences; and he ab&s;olutely declined addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the lords of the admiralty, or the adopting of any concili|atory mea&s;ure, except the Captain returned to Liver|pool, and brought with him certain evidence, or evi|dences, which he in&s;i&s;ted would be the only proper vouchers of his integrity.</P>
<P>It was in vain that our young adventurer remon|&s;trated; that he repre&s;ented the amazing increa&s;e of expen&s;e, which &s;uch a journey, and the detention of the &s;hip, would accumulate to his employer; it was to no purpo&s;e he &s;ugge&s;ted the po&s;&s;ibility, that &s;uch an enormous expenditure might i&s;&s;ue in his own ruin. The con&s;ul continued unyieldingly ob&s;tinate, and the &s;ituation of the Captain was truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing! The merchant, to whom he returned to relate the ill &s;uc|ce&s;s of his application, had exhau&s;ted the utmo&s;t of his influence, in pre&s;enting him to the con&s;ul; he was not particularly known to the officers of the admiral|ty, and he declined any further interference in the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was in this moment of cruel anxiety, that the <HI>trunk-maker</HI> occurred to our &s;ea commander; yet the idea was the drowning man catching at a &s;traw; but having got, however, into the narrowe&s;t and mo&s;t dan|gerous frith, it might be nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould ply his oars, if a full &s;ail would not avail him. He could at lea&s;t deliver his letter; and in a &s;tate of vexation, al|mo&s;t bordering on de&s;pair, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the door of the trunk-maker, which opened, only not &s;pon|taneou&s;ly, and he found him&s;elf in a &s;hop of a &s;pacious and thrifty appearance; it was furni&s;hed with a pro|digious number of trunks, of various &s;izes, and differ|ent degrees of elegance; and every arrangement pro|claimed the <HI>indu&s;trious and ingenious mechanic. All this looked very well in its place; but all this, &s;aid our agitated young man, is nothing to the purpo&s;e.</HI> The ma&s;ter work|man &s;oon made his appearance, and he regarded the &s;tranger with intelligent civility. The letter of intro|duction
<PB N="166" REF="034162_0165_0FFC62649F8B3DB8">
was produced, which being peru&s;ed, the trunk-maker with an air of <HI>true old Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality,</HI> &s;hook the &s;on of Neptune by the hand. "Walk in, Sir; walk in: You have got a little di&s;agreeably entangled, and I &s;uppo&s;e your feelings are all up in arms. To a young man, undi&s;ciplined in the &s;chool of misfortune, the fir&s;t on&s;ets of di&s;appointment are truly painful; but the <HI>vici&s;&s;itudes</HI> of life are as well calculated to furni&s;h a <HI>rational being with hope as with fear; for light as &s;urely &s;ucceeds the darkne&s;s, as the darkne&s;s the light.</HI> Probably you may be at a lo&s;s to conceive in what manner my a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be of u&s;e to you, and as I am at pre&s;ent a little engaged, if you will throw your eye over them loo&s;e papers, they may help you to a clue, which may unravel the my&s;tery."</P>
<P>The Captain, it will not be doubted, eagerly availed him&s;elf of this permi&s;&s;ion; and &s;o regular was the di&s;|po&s;ition of the different e&s;&s;ays, which this <HI>uncommon</HI> compting-hou&s;e di&s;played, that a cur&s;ory glance was &s;ufficient to evince the literary abilities of the author; his con&s;equence to certain per&s;ons high in office was extremely obvious; and it was apparent that his merit, rendering him nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>great,</HI> had procured him free acce&s;s to their private ear, and a con&s;ider|able degree of influence over their determinations.</P>
<P>In two days our Captain received an invitation, to dine in a family way with the trunk-maker; and his reception at his patron's was marked with an expre&s;|&s;ive &s;mile, which indicated a happy termination of his difficulties. <HI>The trunk-maker had conver&s;ed with the lords in office, he had made the nece&s;&s;ary repre&s;entations,</HI> and he had obtained explicit and indi&s;putable credentials for his client, who having gratefully partook of a plain, &s;ub&s;tantial dinner, received with tran&s;port his legal per|mit; and, returning to Liverpool, with a heart glad|dened by the joys of emancipation, immediately reim|barked, proceeding with all expedition to pro&s;ecute his voyage.</P>
<P>Was I the father of a family, the trunk-maker &s;hould be my model; it would be my wi&s;h to furni&s;h the open|ing
<PB N="167" REF="034162_0166_0FFC62630D2F9858">
rea&s;on of my children with every help which might be nece&s;&s;ary to produce them with advantage in the career of knowledge: I would aid them to fig|ure in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed circles; I would &s;timulate them to every laudably &s;plendid pur&s;uit; the avenues of literature &s;hould be thrown open before them, and they &s;hould receive as much information as it was in my power to procure for them: But as, with all my gifts, I &s;hould be anxious to endow them with the means of obtaining as great a &s;hare of <HI>independence</HI> as might con&s;i&s;t with humanity, I would certainly aim at inve&s;ting them with &s;ome u&s;eful qualification, which might &s;erve them in the <HI>la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> as a fund upon which they might draw &s;ufficient to command the nec|e&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>But if the male part of our American world are, in the morning of their lives, too much neglected in this re&s;pect, females have abundantly more rea&s;on to com|plain. Our girls, in general, are bred up with one particular view, with one monopolizing con&s;ideration, which &s;eems to ab&s;orb every other plan that rea&s;on might point out as worthy their attention: An e&s;tab|li&s;hment by marriage; this is the goal to which they are con&s;tantly pointed, the great ultimatum of every arrangement: <HI>An old maid,</HI> they are from infancy taught, at lea&s;t indirectly, to con&s;ider as a contemptible being; and they have no other means of advancing them&s;elves but in the matrimonial line.</P>
<P>Perhaps this is one of the &s;ources, from which orig|inate the infelicities, too often witne&s;&s;ed, in wedded life; the young creature, ardent in the pur&s;uit, is &s;ed|ulou&s;ly employed in di&s;playing all her accompli&s;h|ments; fearful that if &s;he refu&s;es the pre&s;ent offer, no future &s;uppliant may advance his &s;uit; &s;he throws her|&s;elf away upon the fir&s;t pretender, though, po&s;&s;ibly, he may be very ill calculated to embark with her upon the voyage of life.</P>
<P>Well, but &s;he hath gained her point; and the pur|&s;uit over, any further efforts would be u&s;ele&s;s; ev|ery attempt to plea&s;e is given up; and the con&s;e|quences
<PB N="168" REF="034162_0167_0FFC6260481BAB18">
which mu&s;t follow, are too obvious to need the pen of an ob&s;erver to point them out.</P>
<P>I would give my daughters every accompli&s;hment which I thought proper; and, to crown all, I would early accu&s;tom them to habits of indu&s;try and order: They &s;hould be taught with preci&s;ion the art economi|cal; they &s;hould be enabled to procure for them&s;elves the nece&s;&s;aries of life; independence &s;hould be placed within their gra&s;p; and I would teach them "<HI>to rev|erence them&s;elves.</HI>"</P>
<P>Marriage &s;hould not be repre&s;ented as their <HI>&s;umum bonum,</HI> or as a certain, or even nece&s;&s;ary event; they &s;hould learn to re&s;pect a &s;ingle life, and even to regard it as the <HI>mo&s;t eligible,</HI> except a warm, mutual and ju|dicious attachment had gained the a&s;cendancy in the bo&s;om.</P>
<P>If they were thus qualified to admini&s;ter by their <HI>own efforts, to their own wants,</HI> the probability is, that impre&s;&s;ions of this nature, would frequently prevent precipitation, and call into exerci&s;e that deliberation which ought, upon all occa&s;ions, to be the concomitant of every important &s;tep.</P>
<P>Girls, by the avidity and <HI>marked de&s;ign of their op|erations, generally defeat their own purpo&s;es.</HI> I would have the fair minds of young women occupied by &s;chemes of enjoyment, and by modes of living, which, depending principally upon them&s;elves and their <HI>nat|ural connexions,</HI> would involve a greater probability of fruition.</P>
<P>Surely the &s;ituation of that young creature mu&s;t be very plea&s;ing, who, by her &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, engaging manners, and many accompli&s;hments, hath endeared her&s;elf to the circles in which &s;he moves. Why &s;hould contingent events be held up to her view, or made an ab&s;olute part of her expectations? and if her hours are pa&s;&s;ed in endeavouring to augment her little income, whatever it may be, or in cultivating the means which may render her, as an individual, &s;uperior to the caprices of tho&s;e about her, &s;he will certainly be le&s;s likely to look out of her&s;elf for happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="034162_0168_0FFC625DE0DA33B8">

<P>WHEN I was a young man, I had a friend, to whom I was particularly attached; we had lived from our boyi&s;h years in habits of intimacy; and I was of cour&s;e an intere&s;ted ob&s;erver of all his movements.</P>
<P>His family was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the marked integ|rity of even the <HI>minute&s;t</HI> tran&s;actions of its individ|uals; my friend was the younge&s;t born, and every branch, except him&s;elf and his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, were e&s;tab|li&s;hed in little families of their own. They were in|du&s;trious and frugal, realizing, in con&s;equence of their own exertions, an income which enabled them to live in a genteel &s;tyle; and as they were of that grade which is termed <HI>well born,</HI> their right to min|gle in the polite&s;t circles was indi&s;putable. But, as I &s;aid, living within compa&s;s, they were ea&s;y in their circum&s;tances, they were affectionate to each other, and always ready to relieve, to the utmo&s;t of their a|bilities, the nece&s;&s;itous of every de&s;cription.</P>
<P>My friend, at length, after making frequent vi&s;its to New-York, pre&s;ented them with a daughter and a &s;i&s;ter, who, though both a beautiful and an amiable woman, had neverthele&s;s received from education, dif|ferent ideas of life. Gay, unthinking, and profu&s;e by nature, &s;he had never been accu&s;tomed to &s;et bounds
<PB N="170" REF="034162_0169_0FFC625AE1894808">
to her inclinations; and though &s;he truly loved her hu&s;band, &s;he was con&s;tantly involving him in difficul|ties, in order to &s;upport a &s;tyle of life to which his fi|nances were inadequate, and which, however, the re|ciprocality of his attachment induced him to exert eve|ry nerve to maintain. All his connexions &s;aw with pain that his ruin was, by ha&s;ty &s;trides, approaching; but the &s;ubject was delicate, and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that an interference would be ineffectual.</P>
<P>A period of &s;eventeen years was marked by dre&s;s, equipage, and entertainments, while even the <HI>idea of economy</HI> never once mole&s;ted the plea&s;urable arrange|ments of the fair Amanda. At the expiration of this term, that ill-directed female was &s;eized with the &s;mall pox, of which &s;he &s;oon became the victim; and her un|fortunate companion, (who was before &s;inking under the united pre&s;&s;ure of broken health and &s;pirits, that were doubtle&s;s produced by a certainty of the rapid ap|proach of tho&s;e calamities which his good &s;en&s;e could not but acknowledge as the procurement of folly) was, in the cour&s;e of a few &s;ucceeding weeks, inhumed in the &s;ame vault with the beloved object who had co&s;t him &s;o dear.</P>
<P>Two beautiful females were the i&s;&s;ue of this ill-fated marriage; they were not however de&s;titute; for though the effects of the decea&s;ed Henry would not give his creditors ten &s;hillings in the pound, yet the rites funere|al due to the haple&s;s pair, being decently performed, and the hallowed earth that encircled their cold re|mains embalmed by a filial tear, the&s;e lovely orphans were immediately &s;heltered in the bo&s;om of their friends.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Helen, then ju&s;t fifteen years old, accompanied the &s;i&s;ter of Amanda to her abode in the city of New-York; and Mi&s;s Penelope, who had nearly attained her fourteenth year, continued with the relations of Henry.</P>
<P>By way of exemplifying the force of example and the different characters, which the two young ladies from that period a&s;&s;umed, I &s;elect, from a corre&s;pond|ence that continued unbroken during their &s;eparation, the &s;ubjoined letters.</P>

<P>But to be &s;erious&mdash;for once I will endeavour to meet my lovely Monitre&s;s (and dearly do I love my Penel|ope, notwith&s;tanding the air of &s;uperiority, and &s;tyle of reprehen&s;ion, which her letters a&s;&s;ume) upon her own ground; and, by way of re&s;ponding in the mo&s;t explicit manner to her catechi&s;ing epi&s;tle, I will take a &s;light glance at the years which have elap&s;ed &s;ince our &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival in this city, the pre&s;&s;ure upon my &s;pirits which I have already recounted to you, and which was occa&s;ioned by the lamented death of our parents, by my removal from my native place, and from a &s;i&s;ter whom I held dearer than any thing el&s;e which this world contained, was almo&s;t in&s;upportable. However, the efforts of my kind aunt, with the united good offices of my numerous relations and friends, by degrees re&s;tored me to tranquillity; and as I have nat|urally a great deal of vivacity, my wonted gaiety did not long &s;tand aloof.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="034162_0171_0FFC625563C53A00">
Since that period&mdash;what hath taken place &s;ince that period? Po&s;itively I am a mortal enemy to reflection; and my cou&s;in Caroline declares a young lady hath no bu&s;ine&s;s with it. So, my dear Pen, you mu&s;t even re|ceive, as the &s;um total of vi&s;iting, cards, balls and plays, that fa&s;cinating comprehen&s;ive little word, <HI>plea&s;|ure;</HI> and this very <HI>plea&s;urable mode of enjoying life,</HI> you, for&s;ooth, pre&s;ume to chri&s;ten by the odious term <HI>di&s;&s;i|pation;</HI> and my poor &s;uperannuated grandmother, and my good old aunt Dorothy are alarmed at the <HI>di&s;&s;ipated</HI> life which I lead; and becau&s;e, truly, I have no for|tune, I am to make a mope of my&s;elf altogether. I remember this aunt Dorothy of ours never vi&s;ited my mother but &s;he left her in a fit of the vapours; yet if &s;he had intended us for the humble dependants of &s;ome wealthy fool, &s;he &s;hould have forbid our receiving &s;uch in&s;tructions as were calculated to unfit us for &s;o &s;ervile a de&s;tination, though it is well known that the good old &s;oul was always fond of our attaining every accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>For my part, though perhaps I may lay in bed un|til ten in the morning, and though I am not &s;o egre|gious an ignoramus as to be governed by any of your &s;tupid rules, and plodding regulations, yet I can make &s;hift, when I am up, to work a &s;prig upon my mu&s;lin; to chant to the &s;ound of my piano forte, upon which, by the way, I am much improved; to put on the head-dre&s;s which I have received from my milliner with elegance; to figure in any polite a&s;&s;embly; or if, by way of variety, I &s;hould choo&s;e to pa&s;s an hour in my own dre&s;&s;ing-room, I have always the prettie&s;t &s;entimental novels imaginable at hand, to amu&s;e me. Now the&s;e qualifications my dear aunt M&mdash;, who hath been as the tendere&s;t mother to me, declares are quite &s;ufficient for a per&s;on in my line of life; and for cal|culations of every kind, and all peeps into futurity, as I pretend not to the lea&s;t &s;kill in a&s;trology, I leave all the&s;e occult matters to the wi&s;e penetration of my &s;i&s;ter Pen.</P>
<P>One thing, however, my dear, that you may not be unnece&s;&s;arily concerned for your giddy &s;i&s;ter Helen,
<PB N="173" REF="034162_0172_0FFC6253DF6F87F8">
I will ju&s;t whi&s;per you&mdash;I can, whenever I think prop|er, procure my&s;elf the mo&s;t genteel e&s;tabli&s;hment. Many &s;ighing &s;wains are in my train; they do full ju&s;tice, both by words and actions, to my charms; and though they have not yet <HI>ventured an explicit decla|ration, they wait but my imperial nod to &s;ubmit them&s;elves implicitly to my deci&s;ive election.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, any little articles of which I &s;tand in need, are liberally &s;upplied by the ready genero&s;ity of my friends; and I really experience much compla|cency in my &s;ituation, except (you will excu&s;e me, my dear) when I am broken in upon, by your wi&s;e lec|tures; and after all, my dear girl, though you ri&s;e early, live &s;y&s;tematically, and are as grave as the &s;anc|tified wife of a &s;ober country par&s;on, yet I do not &s;ee that your pro&s;pects are in any &s;ort better than mine; and I think the only advantage which you &s;eem to have acquired over me, is the privilege of document|ing your elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, whenever your economical di&s;|po&s;ition of your time will permit you to &s;pare an hour.</P>
<P>Say, Pen. is not this true? Have you any matri|monial &s;cheme in your little head? if you have, do in the name of laughter let us have it. O how delighted I &s;hould be to &s;ee my dear &s;age &s;i&s;ter &s;oberly pacing to church with one of the &s;till life methodical enamo|rato's by whom &s;he is &s;urrounded; but I rather think, and if &s;he will indulge me &s;o far, I will &s;ay, hope, that &s;he will have judgment &s;ufficient to &s;pare my ri&s;ibles this trial.</P>
<P>Now I talk of <HI>judgment,</HI> and am impelled by your remon&s;trances to a kind of retro&s;pect, I recollect but one <HI>capital tran&s;action,</HI> in which my <HI>judgment</HI> hath ever been called into action&mdash;You remember, upon the day of my departure from H&mdash;, that our uncle Horatio, one hour before I took my leave, pre&s;ented me with a hundred pounds, advi&s;ing me to con&s;ult my uncle and aunt M&mdash;in the di&s;po&s;al thereof: But my indul|gent benefactors thinking it right that I &s;hould have the &s;ole and ab&s;olute direction of this &s;um, I locked it up &s;afe in my dre&s;&s;ing-box, until it was proper for me
<PB N="174" REF="034162_0173_0FFC6251B3FEBAE0">
to appear in colours, when I expended it in purcha&s;ing as complete and as elegant a &s;uit of clothes, if not as rich with blond lace, and every other appendage, as New-York can produce! There, my girl&mdash;as I know that my uncle Horatio pre&s;ented you with a like &s;um, let us hear if yours was more advantageou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, dear Pen.

<P>Yet, however we may continue antipodes in every thing el&s;e, I tru&s;t that we &s;hall meet in the centre of mutual affection; at lea&s;t I know, that in all events, I &s;hall &s;till continue your truly attached &s;i&s;ter,</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Mi&s;s PENELOPE to Mi&s;s HELEN AIRY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Town of H&mdash;, <DATE>June 15th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you very &s;incerely, my dear Helen, for every tender expre&s;&s;ion which your letter contains. It is in vain you would a&s;&s;ay to &s;mother the feelings of your &s;i&s;terly heart; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire of natural affection dif|fu&s;es through your lovely bo&s;om its genial heat. In your la&s;t half angry letter, it breaks forth in a variety of places; and I am &s;oothed by the concluding a&s;&s;ur|ance, that you will &s;till continue my tenderly attached &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, my dear, I have learned to re&s;pect the &s;uperior rights, with which &s;ome months elder&s;hip have inve&s;ted you; and if I have been betrayed into any undue warmth, I am po&s;itive that your never que&s;tioned genero&s;ity will forgive me, when you con|&s;ider that the fervour of my remon&s;trances hath pro|ceeded
<PB N="175" REF="034162_0174_0FFC624ED5430610">
entirely from my &s;olicitude, re&s;pecting my be|loved Helen. Perhaps, in my re&s;pon&s;es, I may again be &s;o unhappy as to offend; but plea&s;ingly confident of the advocate which I retain in your brea&s;t, and penning my remarks with all the frankne&s;s of &s;incer|ity, I &s;hall rely wholly upon your invoked candour, to award my pardon.</P>
<P>No, my facetious &s;i&s;ter, <HI>deep thinking</HI> hath not yet furrowed my cheek; and had I no other view than the pre&s;ervation of the &s;mooth poli&s;h of my complexion, it would be incumbent upon me to realize &s;uch a men|tal fund, as would enable me to encounter with due equanimity the ills of life, thereby avoiding that hur|ricane of the pa&s;&s;ions, which in its progre&s;s not only levels intellectual tranquillity, but makes al&s;o dread|ful ravages in the beauty of the fine&s;t face.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over, without a comment, your account, with its &s;um total, of your manner of pa&s;&s;ing your time; but I cannot forbear expre&s;&s;ing the keen regrets I ex|perienced, when my honoured grandmamma, reach|ing forth her hand for the letter, that had been an|nounced from the child of her affection; from that child, for whom her revered bo&s;om hourly heaves the tender and apprehen&s;ive &s;igh; my feelings, I &s;ay, were perfectly agonized, when I found my&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to deny her a gratification which &s;he had fondly an|ticipated; but when I beheld the venerable matron, matured by wi&s;dom, and dignified by a length of years, every hour of which had been marked by pro|priety, and elevated by a uniform pur&s;uit of virtue, when I was daily receiving proofs that her &s;trong mind, &s;uperior to the decays of nature, was &s;till augmenting its acquirements, was &s;till more invigorated by ob&s;er|vation, could I &s;o far outrage her tenderne&s;s, or vio|late that deference which was due to her experience, as to put a letter, in which &s;he was &s;o unworthily men|tioned, into her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? Neither to my aunt Dor|othy could I be more communicative&mdash;Alas! alas! But I will only &s;ay, that in the <HI>name of &s;acred duty I conjure you</HI> no more to pen a line which I cannot read
<PB N="176" REF="034162_0175_0FFC624CF7F43BE8">
for per&s;ons, who are at lea&s;t entitled to your inviola|ble re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Our aunt Dorothy, my dear, wi&s;hes not to &s;ee us dependant upon any one; &s;he is anxious to in&s;pire our bo&s;oms with the <HI>noble ardour of independence;</HI> and, to this end &s;he is &s;olicitous that we &s;hould cultivate, to their utmo&s;t extent, the talents we po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;upplies which you receive from our York friends, are plea&s;ing in&s;tances of their genero&s;ity; but can you not conceive a <HI>&s;uperiour plea&s;ure</HI> in being able to <HI>admini&s;ter to your own wants?</HI> And do you not re|member, that agreeably to the cour&s;e of nature the probability is, that tho&s;e neare&s;t to you in con&s;anguin|ity, will be removed; and will you be content to re|main the dependant upon the caprice, or even bounty, of more di&s;tant relations?</P>
<P>You &s;eem to que&s;tion if the arrangements which I have been directed to make, are more promi&s;ing. I proceed, my dear, to &s;ketch them for you, and you may then be able to form an accurate judgment, rel|ative to the comparative eligibility of our pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>To begin with the hundred pounds, of which you require an account. It was, agreeably to the direction of my aunt Dorothy, the very next day after its re|ceipt, put into the hands of a &s;ub&s;tantial friend, who accounts with me for it, upon legal compound intere&s;t; if it had been a <HI>le&s;s &s;um,</HI> I &s;hould have di&s;po&s;ed of it preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner; nor have I ever yet a|vailed my&s;elf of the profits of a &s;ingle penny ari&s;ing therefrom.</P>
<P>I will confe&s;s to you, that having ob&s;erved the gen|eral approbation by which my aunt Dorothy was di&s;tingui&s;hed, I have regarded her as my model.</P>
<P>My time, &s;ince our melancholy &s;eparation, hath been divided among my numerous friends; and they are &s;o indulgent as to con&s;ider my vi&s;its rather as a plea&s;ing circum&s;tance. But though they are in gen|eral po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the means of living genteelly, yet I know that they are in the practice of economy. I do not choo&s;e to le&s;&s;en the patrimony of my cou&s;ins; and
<PB N="177" REF="034162_0176_0FFC624A163E5DD0">
if I con&s;ent to receive any pecuniary mark of their favour, it mu&s;t be <HI>&s;ome trifle,</HI> which I accept as a <HI>me|mento of their affection.</HI></P>
<P>One month's per&s;everance, enabled me to ri&s;e each morning, mechanically with the &s;un; and this habit now con&s;titutes one of the plea&s;ures of my life, nor would I relinqui&s;h it, was I empre&s;s of the globe. I do not neglect to pur&s;ue tho&s;e &s;tudies, of which my dear and tender parents were careful to furni&s;h the rudiments; neither my reading, mu&s;ic, draw|ing, or geography are forgotten; they make a part of the employments of every day; they &s;erve to improve and to poli&s;h my mind; and when I have made &s;ufficient progre&s;s therein, they will open to me, &s;hould there be occa&s;ion, new &s;ources of emolument as well as plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>With regard to my apparel, the hand&s;ome dividend of that which was the property of my beloved mother, and which fell to my &s;hare, is to me an ample &s;upply of almo&s;t every article. You will perhaps be &s;urpri&s;ed, when I tell you I do not wear wrought mu&s;lin; it is true, much of my time is devoted to the pro&s;ecution of this fa&s;hionable and elegant employ; but my younger cou&s;ins are ornamented by the product of my indu&s;try, while I receive, for every hour of needle work, not nece&s;&s;arily appropriated to my&s;elf, a liberal compen&s;ation; and, from &s;ums thus accumulated, I not only command the articles of which I am in want, I have not only made hand&s;ome additions to my original fund, but I always have in re&s;erve, little &s;ums, which I con&s;ecrate to the relief of the nece&s;&s;itous; and, believe me, my dear Helen, that when I am ar|rayed in my decent plain mu&s;lin, or milk white mu&s;li|net, fitted clo&s;e to my little wai&s;t, I feel an innate con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of much greater propriety of character, <HI>the mediocrity of my circum&s;tances con&s;idered,</HI> than if I was arrayed in flowing robes of the fine&s;t texture which ever i&s;&s;ued from the loom, in the mo&s;t variegated ti&s;&s;ue which art hath ever yet invented.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="034162_0177_0FFC6246DBDFD188">
It is really &s;urpri&s;ing, how much <HI>order</HI> and <HI>indu&s;try</HI> will accompli&s;h; and my retro&s;pect is truly plea&s;ing, when I reflect upon the different pieces of needle work, which I have, in the cour&s;e of a few years, &s;o advan|tageou&s;ly completed. Yet my application is not un|remitted; and I vi&s;it, as often as is nece&s;&s;ary, though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, my &s;ingers are generally employed.</P>
<P>I &s;ometimes mingle in a ball-room; dancing is an amu&s;ement of which I am peculiarly fond; and I have <HI>literally murdered</HI> &s;ome evenings at cards. An oppor|tunity of &s;eeing a good play, as they are with us &s;o unfrequent, I have not to charge my&s;elf with ever mi&s;&s;ing; and I am careful to take as much exerci&s;e as will conduce to my health. Stimulated by my aunt, in every action, <HI>independence</HI> hath been my ardent pur&s;uit; and I am &s;olicitous to realize &s;ufficient, &s;hould I be overtaken by ill health, to prevent my devolving as a burthen upon others.</P>
<P>It is the wi&s;h of my aunt, as &s;he hath no immediate de&s;cendants of her own, to dedicate her little fortune, upon her demi&s;e, to charitable u&s;es; and as &s;he cannot con&s;cientiou&s;ly gratify this her favourite plan, if &s;he leaves behind her any needy relation, &s;he is the more de&s;irous that her family &s;hould, individually, po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of obtaining for them&s;elves an honourable &s;upport. God forbid, that ever my dear Helen, or my&s;elf, &s;hould, however remotely, curtail the &s;ums that may be employed for the &s;alutary purpo&s;e of wiping the tear from the cheek of indigence.</P>
<P>With regard to my matrimonial expectations, upon which you are &s;o ludicrou&s;ly playful, I have to &s;ay, that the idea of marriage makes no part of my <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> plans; this, my dear, is a <HI>calculation, at which you &s;eem to be abundantly</HI> more expert than my&s;elf; it is a con|tingence which, being within the chapter of po&s;&s;ibilities, may, or may not happen; if it &s;hould, my arrange|ments mu&s;t, in &s;ome re&s;pects, be different; if it &s;hould not, I am contented; at any rate, I e&s;teem it an error; to reckon upon an event, which is at be&s;t but uncer|tain.
<PB N="179" REF="034162_0178_0FFC6244785927D8">
I am ignorant, if I have ever yet been regarded with particular attention by the other &s;ex; no one hath <HI>profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a candidate for my election; and, however a&s;&s;iduous any gentleman might be, I &s;hould not deem my&s;elf authorized to &s;et him down as a lover, except his declarations were of a nature the mo&s;t explicit.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;ay truth, I am not over &s;olicitous upon this head; having before me &s;uch an example as my aunt Dorothy, I know that re&s;pectability, u&s;efulne&s;s, tran|quillity, independence, &s;ocial enjoyments, and holy friend&s;hip, are to be found in a &s;ingle life; and I am induced rationally to conclude, that if minds are not congenial, if they are not di&s;creetly, mutually, and permanently attached, a &s;tate of celibacy is by far the mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>But having, by my circum&s;tantial replies, dimpled the blooming cheek of my charming Helen, perhaps by a &s;mile of pity; I only add, the warm and tender &s;alutations of her &s;incerely affectionate</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mi&s;s Helen put up her pretty lip&mdash;her &s;i&s;ter's letter was unan&s;werable; but &s;he was unconvinced, or at lea&s;t uninfluenced, and they both progre&s;&s;ed on, in the different paths in which example had produced them.</P>
<P>The virtues of Penelope were &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed by an amiable man, who was indeed her congenial &s;oul; his fortune was moderate, and his pro&s;pects were good: A happy hymen was the con&s;equence, and they con|tinue as amiable a pair as over exchanged the matri|monial vow.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;ipated manners of Helen, her fondne&s;s for dre&s;s and &s;how, with the extravagant &s;entiments which &s;he at all times avowed, deterred the &s;en&s;ible part of the male world from cheri&s;hing an idea of a &s;erious connexion with a young per&s;on whom they conceived

it impo&s;&s;ible to dome&s;ticate. Her uncle and aunt are no more; and their prodigality expended even the patrimony of their children. A &s;imilar mode of living hath circum&s;cribed the career of all her boa&s;ted ma|ternal connexions; and Mi&s;s Helen, now rapidly ap|proaching the decline of life, hath become a fixed ap|pendage to the family of her &s;i&s;ter; <HI>a dependant upon the liberality of tho&s;e, whom &s;he regarded with &s;en&s;ations bordering upon contempt:</HI> But their fine qualities will doubtle&s;s render that dependance as &s;ilken as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Barckley Rece&s;s, <DATE>September 13th, 1793.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>FRIEND VIGILLIUS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO &s;eriou&s;ly confe&s;s unto thee, that I am not a little plea&s;ed with the light which <HI>&s;eemeth</HI> to be within thee; yet feeling my&s;elf wonderfully at a lo&s;s, what conclu&s;ion to draw concerning thee, I am jealous over thee with a godly jealou&s;y. From &s;ome precious gems which have been &s;cattered up and down thy publications, I have been ready to think, that thou wert truly of the fraternity of Friends, that thou had&s;t obtained uncommon lights, and that thy heart was in|deed
<PB N="181" REF="034162_0180_0FFC624098917978">
touched by that &s;eraph, who, taking a coal from the altar, con&s;ecrated therewith the till then unhal|lowed lips of the prophet I&s;aiah. I mu&s;t acknowledge that I have a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, and perhaps vainly, encour|aged this idea; and moreover, that when I &s;aw thee lead the comely maiden, whom thou ha&s;t cheri&s;hed, to the altar, after the manner of the profane, with no &s;mall inquietude I relinqui&s;hed my hopes in regard to thee.</P>
<P>But if thou art not a Friend, the que&s;tion remain|eth, What then art thou? I believe that thou meane&s;t very well; and that thou ha&s;t great goodne&s;s of heart at the bottom; but &s;uffer an hone&s;t ob&s;erver to &s;et up for thee a land-mark; take care that thou art not mi&s;led thereby, that thou &s;ticke&s;t not fa&s;t in the quick|&s;ands of error, or, that following an <HI>ignis &s;atuus,</HI> thou runne&s;t not on &s;hore upon the &s;hoals of mi&s;conception. There is a fatal delu&s;ion, which is now but too preva|lent in our country; a delu&s;ion, the fundamental principle of which, re&s;toring the lap&s;ed nature, finally returns every individual of the degenerate children of men to the &s;tate of felicity which they have &s;o notori|ou&s;ly forfeited: Verily I &s;hudder at the bare penning of &s;o pernicious and heterodox a vagary; and I am rendered the more fearfully apprehen&s;ive, from a knowledge of the plau&s;ibility with which its enthu&s;i|a&s;tic advocates enwrap the &s;oul-de&s;troying here&s;y! Many paragraphs in thy lucubrations, render me &s;u&s;|picious that, under the influence of benevolence, thou ha&s;t inhaled the &s;treams which have i&s;&s;ued from &s;o poi&s;onous a fountain; but again, from a number of choice &s;entiments, which thou ha&s;t occa&s;ionally inter|&s;per&s;ed, I am led to &s;uppo&s;e that thou looke&s;t upon thy&s;elf as a re&s;pon&s;ible being, that thou conceive&s;t thy|&s;elf accountable for thy actions, and that thou ration|ally conclude&s;t thou &s;halt receive a reward according to the deeds done in the body.</P>

<P>As a general an&s;wer to friend Doubtful, it may be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the Gleaner a&s;pireth not to the dignified chair of the theologician; that whatever are his &s;entiments, he hath entire complacency therein; that he is content with propo&s;ing them to the rea&s;on of his family, without parading them to public view, or enforcing them upon any one.</P>
<P>Yet, thus called upon, though he doth not propo&s;e him&s;elf as a &s;ectarian, and though <HI>upon this occa&s;ion,</HI> he may not avow the creed of the chri&s;tian Univer&s;ali&s;t; he yet craves the indulgence of his readers, while he takes leave to hazard a few remarks.</P>
<P>He is free to own, notwith&s;tanding the de&s;poti&s;m of tradition, the prejudices of education, and the predom|inating &s;way of revered opinions, that he cannot help regarding that plan as the mo&s;t eligible, which repre|&s;ents the Father of eternity, as beneficently planning, before all worlds, the career of a race of beings, who however they were immer&s;ed in ills, and from the various vici&s;&s;itudes of time, plunged into a &s;eries of misfortunes, were de&s;tined, neverthele&s;s, to progre&s;s on to a &s;tate of never ending felicity. Jehovah, while thus employed, appears augu&s;tly <HI>good,</HI> as well as au|gu&s;tly <HI>great,</HI> and every faculty of the mind rejoiceth to adore the paternal Deity.</P>
<P>We he&s;itate not to combine, in our ideas of the great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e, with an unrivalled &s;overeignty of power, that unerring <HI>pre&s;cience,</HI> which, indeed, &s;eems truly nece&s;&s;ary to infinite wi&s;dom, and the fullne&s;s of the Godhead.</P>
<P>Would it not be impious, to &s;uppo&s;e the Creator originating the va&s;t de&s;igns of creation with a di&s;po|&s;ition unpropitious to the well being of his creatures?
<PB N="183" REF="034162_0182_0FFC623B6BC39D00">
Would it not be mo&s;t ab&s;urdly irreverent, to repre&s;ent the creature as independent of the power which had formed him, and as unexpectedly e&s;caping from the orbit in which he was placed? Would it not be bla&s;|phemous to arm him with &s;trength &s;ufficient to fru&s;|trate the benevolent purpo&s;es which primarily gave him exi&s;tence? Is not that conjecture highly irrational which renders him capable of obtaining the knowledge of good and evil, without the permi&s;&s;ion of that om|nipotent Father of univer&s;al nature, who had moulded him agreeably to his own de&s;ignation, who had &s;haped for him his little part, who had commanded him into being, who could make him whatever he plea&s;ed, and who could, in a &s;ingle moment, recal the animating breath of life, which he is &s;aid to have breathed into him? We can ea&s;ily reconcile, with the arrangements of equi|ty, allotments which may be clouded with mi&s;ery, through the lengthening period of many revolving years, provided that the horizon at length brightens upon us, and we are finally pre&s;ented with a happy termination.</P>
<P>The &s;oul of man is indeed capacious; it can inhale, in one luxuriant moment, &s;uch large draughts of di|vine enjoyments, as may in effect obliterate the pain|ful remembrance of calamitous centuries; and, in a future de&s;tination, we may awake only to the &s;acred rapture of corrected plea&s;ures. Nor do we know that &s;entiments of this complexion are unfriendly to the in|tere&s;ts of virtue; for, be&s;ides the oft cited ob&s;ervation, that rectitude in&s;ures its own reward, and that a &s;tate of &s;uffering mu&s;t ever be con&s;idered as an appendage to vice; there is a view in which we may &s;till be re|garded as probationers, as accountable beings; and re|wards and puni&s;hments mu&s;t ever remain in the hands of our common Father.</P>
<P>We conceive that the &s;y&s;tem, which, bounding the &s;alutary operations of Deity, confines his gracious in|terference to an <HI>elected few, while the many are con&s;igned to perdition,</HI> and which con&s;iders this awful decree as irrever&s;ible, looks with a much more unfavourable a&s;|pect upon the moral walk, than the denounced &s;enti|ments

of the Univer&s;ali&s;t; &s;ince it as effectually de|&s;troys every exertion to obtain the prize of future be|atification, for the immutable determination of Jehovah hath unalterably fixed the de&s;tiny of every candidate. This di&s;criminating plan, while it merits, in a high de|gree, the accu&s;ation of unwarrantable partiality, (the mo&s;t reprehen&s;ible characters not &s;eldom becoming the objects of its predilection) throws open, at the &s;ame time, the widely terrific gates of de&s;pair. It is more|over the parent of &s;chi&s;m; and it inve&s;ts the arrogant mind with every incentive to pride and undue &s;elf-e&s;timation, authorizing the &s;uppo&s;ed privileged being to believe, that the eternal difference, which mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity forever exi&s;t between him&s;elf and the greater part of his fellow-mortals, may ju&s;tify proceedings again&s;t them, for which a jury of philanthropy would find him guilty of high trea&s;on again&s;t the Rights of Man.</P>
<P>We think the hypothe&s;is, which is ever goading us to the performance of duty, by threats of the uplifted la&s;h, is not a little derogatory to the dignity of our nature.

<P>I remember, &s;ome fifteen or &s;ixteen years &s;ince, be|ing on a vi&s;it to a friend in the capital of the State of Rhode-I&s;land, that chance threw me one evening into a company, in which a certain tran&s;atlantic preacher,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author's de&s;ign in thus expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf of a per&s;on with whom &s;he boa&s;ts the mo&s;t intimate connexion, will be ob|vious to every intelligent reader.

time, and I am told that he &s;till continues to attract much attention in the religious world. Perhaps he may ju&s;tly be &s;tyled the father of the Univer&s;ali&s;ts in this country; and however cen&s;urable I may be deem|ed, I freely confe&s;s that I was not, upon the occa&s;ion adverted too, di&s;plea&s;ed at his ideas. Among other curious anecdotes and ob&s;ervations, which con&s;tituted his quota of the conver&s;ation, he produced a dream, which made no &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind; wheth|er he him&s;elf was favoured with this nocturnal vi&s;ion, or whether it was the privilege of a friend, I do not recollect; nor is it of importance to determine.</P>
<P>Its outlines were as follows: Sleep had &s;pread over the clo&s;ed eyelids its &s;ombre veil, and the illimitable region of fancy became illumined by a prodigious va|riety of lu&s;tres; myriads of winged beings &s;eemed to flit around; now, the empre&s;s of the &s;lumbering hour crowded the &s;cene with motley &s;ketches of every ob|ject which a teeming imagination could devi&s;e; and anon, as if &s;olicitous to vary the entertainment of the night, a &s;plendid &s;olitude gradually pervading, ex|tended it&s;elf around. It was at this moment that an intere&s;ting form, robed in &s;potle&s;s white, and moving with inexpre&s;&s;ible velocity, pre&s;ented her&s;elf before the &s;leeper: Dignity was in&s;cribed on her very mien, her a&s;pect was maje&s;tic, and every look became expre&s;&s;ive of &s;ome important de&s;ignation; in her right hand &s;he gra&s;ped a blazing torch, and in her left &s;he bore a tran&s;parent va&s;e, which, con&s;tantly i&s;&s;uing a copious &s;tream, &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the properties of a living &s;pring. Ha&s;ting along, with inconceivable rapidity, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed forward, and it was with difficulty that he detained her, while he humbly reque&s;ted information re&s;pecting the nature of her office and employ; briefly &s;he replied, "Know, inqui&s;itive mortal, that, commi&s;|&s;ioned by the Ancient of Days, I go forth, with this flaming torch, to light up a conflagration which &s;hall con&s;ume the heaven of heavens, while the exhau&s;t|le&s;s fountain in my left hand &s;hall pour forth a flood, who&s;e waters &s;hall utterly extingui&s;h the devouring,

<P>The con&s;ternation produced by this a&s;toni&s;hing piece of information, di&s;pelled the &s;omnific influence of the drow&s;y godde&s;s; and the reflections which it originated in his bo&s;om, mu&s;t occur to every &s;erious mind.</P>
<P>I have been amazed when I have li&s;tened to the declarations of tho&s;e, who have prote&s;ted, that if a &s;tate of retribution was not in re&s;erve, they would em|bark, with a full &s;ail, upon what they have termed the ocean of unlicen&s;ed plea&s;ure, and that they would take in large draughts of illicit gratifications!&mdash;Surely, &s;uch per&s;ons have never yet awaked to the be&s;t enjoy|ments of life&mdash;are yet to receive the perceptions, which alone can entitle them to a rank among the dignified order of rational beings.</P>
<P>Independent of every future con&s;ideration, how &s;e|renely rolls on the days of that individual, who is &s;o|licitous to employ his time, his talents, and his abili|ties of every de&s;cription, in a manner calculated to do honour to him&s;elf, and to conduce to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of his fellow mortals!</P>
<P>View the well regulated family; no &s;ooner do their eyelids unclo&s;e, than their grateful ori&s;ons &s;pontane|ou&s;ly and individually a&s;cend the vaulted &s;kies; with the fir&s;t upri&s;ing of the orient beam, they are a&s;&s;em|bled in the neatly furni&s;hed parlour, where, from the &s;acred oracles, a portion for their improvement and con&s;olation is &s;elected; where their common teacher, in words fitly cho&s;en, energetic and conci&s;e, and in a manly and endearing tone of voice, offers up their unit|ed and early thank&s;givings, &s;upplications and prai&s;e, to the univer&s;al Sire of angels and of men.</P>
<P>This &s;eparate and collected intercour&s;e with Heaven, will con&s;titute them reciprocal guards upon them&s;elves and each other; they will be cautious of offending; their words and their actions they will con&s;ider, and

they will be anxious to conduct as per&s;ons privileged by a frequent acce&s;s to the Sovereign Di&s;po&s;er of events.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic departments will be filled in an allot|ted and regular manner; the affairs of the hou&s;ehold will go &s;moothly forward; the individuals will recip|rocally a&s;&s;i&s;t each other; and pla&s;tic order, with af|fectionate harmony, will pre&s;ide among them. They will look abroad, and, finding a complacency in com|municating good, they will feel it their intere&s;t, as well as their duty, to relieve, to &s;oothe, to &s;uccour, and to &s;upport, to the utmo&s;t of their ability, the &s;uf|fering &s;ons and daughters of men; and while thus en|gaged in mitigating foreign woes, in extending the extricating hand, they will find that the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven-born peace have become natal in their bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>In the varied and intere&s;ting offices of &s;ocial life, they will cheerfully engage; they are apprized of what their characters demand of them; and the hap|pine&s;s of their exten&s;ive connexions, they are careful to promote. As members of the community, they will di&s;charge with propriety their parts, and they will ever reflect the highe&s;t honour upon their coun|try. When they are overtaken by the unavoidable calamities incident to the pre&s;ent mode of exi&s;tence, in every affliction, they will naturally pour out their &s;pirits in prayer: This is a privilege which will meli|orate their &s;ufferings; and, accu&s;tomed to addre&s;s the great Origin of being, they will ha&s;ten with alac|rity to the throne of grace. Whatever may be their employments or amu&s;ements, in the cour&s;e of the day, or during the clo&s;ing evening, being careful to com|bine innocence withal&mdash;they will gladly turn from every inferior or trivial pur&s;uit, and when the empire of night is commencing, they will re-a&s;&s;emble in the peaceful apartment, that will be thus con&s;ecrated, and, by the mouth of their revered head, they will perform the evening pro&s;trations of their devoted &s;pirits, wor|&s;hipping with &s;incere hearts, enumerating the multi|plied ble&s;&s;ings of the day, and offering up their ming|ling

hallelujahs, thank&s;givings and adorations. Their errors, of whatever nature, they will deplore with con|trite hearts; but with child-like di&s;po&s;itions they will approach, and they will be confident that their augu&s;t Father, who pitieth their infirmities, bendeth to their &s;upplications a gracious ear. Calm, grateful, and di&s;burthened of their heavie&s;t load, they will retire to pre&s;ent their &s;eparate ejaculations, and they will com|mit them&s;elves to the &s;lumbers of the pillow with heart felt tranquillity.</P>
<P>The theme is copious; I have rapidly hurried along; I could dwell untired upon the charms, and the un|que&s;tionable utility, attendant upon the pre&s;ent hours of an unoffending and u&s;eful life.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>"ALL <HI>is not right at Margaretta's"</HI>&mdash;&s;aid my poor Mary, &s;ome nights &s;ince, as &s;he laid her head upon her pillow. It was an involuntary expre&s;|&s;ion, and from the fullne&s;s of her heart it e&s;caped her: She would gladly have recalled it, or at lea&s;t have pal|liated its effects, but it was too late, for the impre&s;&s;ion was indelibly made&mdash;<HI>all is not right at Margaretta's!</HI> Her words reverberated through the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of my &s;oul; they &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a deadly power, which, at a &s;ingle blow, annihilated the &s;erenity of my bo&s;om. A thou&s;and painful ideas ru&s;hed in a moment upon my mind, and they originated the mo&s;t alarm|ing and affecting conjectures.</P>
<P>I had ob&s;erved, that a kind of pen&s;ive melancholy had for &s;ome time clouded the fine open countenance of my wife; that her wonted equanimity was inter|rupted; that her &s;lumbers were di&s;turbed and broken;
<PB N="189" REF="034162_0188_0FFC622E32E4F9F8">
and that the admirable regularity of her move|ments were evidently di&s;compo&s;ed. As I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a perfect confidence in her prudence, I had forborne to pre&s;s her upon &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a change, well knowing, that whenever it was advantageous or proper, di&s;cre|tion would not fail of prompting her to pour into my ear the &s;orrows of her heart.</P>
<P>Maternal affection had armed her with an anxious and vigilant attention to her daughter; &s;he had for &s;ome months marked a vi&s;ible alteration in her child; the dimpling &s;mile of complacency no more &s;ponta|neou&s;ly welcomed her approach; thick glooms en|circled her brow; and while &s;he vi&s;ibly &s;truggled to pre&s;erve appearances, the tenor of her &s;oul was ap|parently lo&s;t! Whenever Mary occa&s;ionally looked in upon her Margaretta, if her vi&s;it was unexpected, &s;he was &s;ure to find her bathed in tears; and the apologies which &s;he &s;eemed to &s;tudy, but ill concealed the di&s;compo&s;ure of an agonized bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Mary, with all her penetration, could not divine the cau&s;e of an event, which &s;he &s;o greatly deplored; &s;he imagined that her daughter was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing which could conduce to the mo&s;t plea&s;ing kind of tranquillity; and &s;he conceived that the grateful affections of her heart ought to be in con&s;tant exerci&s;e. Competency beamed its regular, mild, and equal ble&s;&s;ings upon her; her infant was not only lovely and promi&s;ing, but he &s;eemed almo&s;t exempted from tho&s;e di&s;orders, which are u&s;ually attendant upon his imbecile age; her own health was uniformly good; and though Edward Hamilton partook, of cour&s;e, the morbid contagion of her grief, yet he was &s;till the pen&s;ively plea&s;ing and entertaining companion.</P>
<P>Mary concluded, that nothing remained, but for Margaretta to re-a&s;&s;ume the accu&s;tomed equability of her temper, in order to the perfect re&s;toration of that &s;un&s;hine, which had for a &s;ea&s;on illumed her hours; and tenderly intere&s;ted, while her heart was torn by anxiety, &s;he could not forbear to interrogate&mdash;but the only replies &s;he could obtain were &s;ighs and tears,

interrupted by broken a&s;&s;urances, that indeed &s;he was&mdash;&s;he was very happy; and that &s;he &s;upplicated her dear Mamma to put upon every appearance the mo&s;t candid con&s;truction. Her mother, however, made wi&s;e by the ob&s;ervations &s;he had collected from books, from the &s;tudy of her fellow mortals, and from a large &s;hare of natural di&s;cernment, could not be thus ea&s;ily deceived.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity was, upon this occa&s;ion, her &s;malle&s;t in|ducement; and &s;he trembled at the impervious dark|ne&s;s of a cloud, which &s;he rationally apprehended involved the deare&s;t hopes of her Margaretta! Baffled in repeated attempts to fathom a my&s;tery, which had yielded her bo&s;om a prey to the keene&s;t angui&s;h, &s;he changed the mode of her attack; and, addre&s;&s;ing her daughter by letter, in the language of di&s;cretion, in the language of tenderne&s;s, &s;he penned the feelings of her &s;oul.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mrs. HAMILTON.</HEAD>
<P>IS it po&s;&s;ible for Margaretta Hamilton to conceive her mother a calm &s;pectator of that corroding inqui|etude, which is gradually and too &s;urely undermining the peace of a child, who is, &s;he had almo&s;t &s;aid, dearer to her than any other human being? As I have not been &s;timulated by an idle wi&s;h to obtain your &s;ecret, I am hurt that my inquiries have proved &s;o ineffectual. Can Margaretta wi&s;h to veil her&s;elf from the eye of the guardian friend of her early years? Believe me, I &s;eek only to probe the wound, that I may the more a&s;&s;uredly arre&s;t the progre&s;s of the envenomed poi&s;on, and be enabled to judge what pre&s;cription may operate as a &s;pecific.</P>
<P>But, for the tender age of innocence, the advice of the phy&s;ician is the &s;uper&s;tructure of conjecture; and in this in&s;tance I am nece&s;&s;itated to follow the example of the benevolent practitioner, at all hazards a&s;&s;aying to throw in &s;omething, which may po&s;&s;ibly pre&s;erve the opening life of tho&s;e budding joys, the growth of
<PB N="191" REF="034162_0190_0FFC6228EF92E4E0">
which I had fondly hoped to have watched, until I had gratulated their confirmed maturity.</P>
<P>When we gave our Margaretta to Edward Hamil|ton, <HI>we conceived that we had yielded her to the man of her heart;</HI> and, believing him to be every way worthy, we congratulated our&s;elves upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the felicity of our child. What, my love, can have produced a change &s;o affectingly agonizing? When|ever you <HI>appear</HI> tolerably compo&s;ed, it is <HI>evident</HI> that you are <HI>acting</HI> a part.</P>
<P>I tremble le&s;t your father &s;hould penetrate the thin di&s;gui&s;es which you a&s;&s;ume; and, &s;anguine as his ex|pectations in regard to you have been, it is difficult to &s;ay, what &s;erious con&s;equences his di&s;appointment might produce.</P>
<P>Oh, my child, my &s;oul is torn by the mo&s;t fearful conjectures! will you not endeavour to a&s;&s;uage the &s;orrows of my heart? will you not at lea&s;t relieve me from the pangs of &s;u&s;pen&s;e? Can it be, that Mrs. Hamilton is &s;o far &s;ubjected to &s;exual weakne&s;s, as to have delivered her&s;elf up to the mo&s;t alarming cha|grin, merely becau&s;e, perhaps, &s;he receives not from the hu&s;band &s;uch <HI>adulatory devoirs</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed the lover? Surely I ought to regard this idea as inad|mi&s;&s;ible; and yet, the &s;tronge&s;t minds may have their moments of imbecility; and, my Margaretta, all accompli&s;hed, all lovely as &s;he is, mu&s;t neverthele&s;s &s;till be con&s;idered as a young and inexperienced woman.</P>
<P>If this is indeed the &s;ource of your perturbed anxiety, I per&s;uade my&s;elf that &s;ome &s;uch reflections as the following, will ere long awaken you to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to change the order of nature. De|lighted admiration of plea&s;ing novelties, is the &s;ponta|neous growth of every bo&s;om; a &s;econd view finds us more calm; a third, a fourth, may po&s;&s;ibly rou&s;e us to plea&s;ure; but a con&s;tant repetition will create that indifference, which will con&s;titute a perfect contra&s;t to the keen edge of our new-born feelings. The impa&s;|&s;ioned ardours of the &s;oul mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ub&s;ide;

<HI>they are but created to expire:</HI> But I pity the mind which prefers not the calm rational affections that &s;uc|ceed, to all the hurricane of the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Love, as it is commonly de&s;cribed, is undoubtedly a &s;hort-lived being; it is a luxurious glutton, that in|variably gormandizeth to its de&s;truction; but from its perfumed a&s;hes ari&s;eth a &s;tar-gemmed &s;oother, that the wedded pair may either cru&s;h in the birth, or agree to cheri&s;h, as the &s;ecurity of their mutual happine&s;s. E&s;teem may &s;ometimes be traced as the <HI>parent,</HI> but I think it will be found that it is oftener the <HI>offspring</HI> of love.

<P>Behold your Edward in a large circle of ladies; doubtle&s;s, he is all attention; his features are animat|ed; and if they are young, beautiful and &s;entimental, he is all &s;oul; he &s;eems to tread on air, and he hath no eyes or ears, but for them; he will addre&s;s to them the mo&s;t refined gallantries, and he will appear lo&s;t amid a con&s;tellation &s;o &s;plendid. But think you, my love, that he would experience &s;en&s;ations thus highly wrought, were he to mingle every hour in their &s;oci|ety? and would you wi&s;h to exchange for &s;uch <HI>men|tal gewgaws,</HI> if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, the &s;olid plea&s;ures of endearing familiarity; the advantages re|&s;ulting from unbroken confidence, from a &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e, uninterrupted by the fopperies of language, and from all the matchle&s;s and &s;erene enjoyments which wedded friends may know?</P>
<P>Are you not apprehen&s;ive that the continued clouds which gloom your lovely face, may prematurely de|&s;troy your bloom, and, by imperceptible degrees, alienate the affections of your hu&s;band? If once you relinqui&s;h your place in his bo&s;om, it will require a &s;eries of the mo&s;t arduous efforts to re&s;tore you to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion you will have thus imprudently ab|dicated!</P>

<P>PITYING angels&mdash;and mu&s;t I then &s;peak? a&s;&s;ur|edly I mu&s;t&mdash;every con&s;ideration unque&s;tionably points out an explanation.</P>
<P>I have &s;unk, mortifyingly &s;unk, in the e&s;timation of her who&s;e <HI>approbation</HI> I would die to pre&s;erve; and I have inflicted upon her the &s;evere&s;t angui&s;h; yet, prob|ably, her tender bo&s;om may be di&s;burthened, by a knowledge that her Margaretta is not altogether &s;o culpable as &s;he hath apprehended: And duty &s;eems to impel an unre&s;erved confidence; for the honoured woman, to whom I am primarily indebted for every thing that can render life valuable, hath commanded me to be explicit.</P>
<P>But &s;top!&mdash;can duties cla&s;h? Ought the di&s;creet female to accu&s;e him to whom &s;he hath voluntarily yielded her mo&s;t &s;acred and &s;olemn vows? Can Mar|garetta criminate her Edward!!!!</P>
<P>Yet, po&s;&s;ibly, what I have to urge in my own de|fence, may not exhibit my Hamilton in a cen&s;urable point of view; from a mutable being we are not to expect immutability; and, if my conjectures have their foundation in truth, though I may be wretched, I will not be unju&s;t. It is nece&s;&s;ary that I ju&s;tify my|&s;elf to my mother; but I will not dare to ca&s;t a &s;hade upon the character of a man, whom I regard as the fir&s;t of created beings.</P>
<P>Hardly three months after our marriage had elap|&s;ed, when Edward exhibited marks of a growing and deep-felt inquietude! an impenetrable gloom over|&s;hadowed every feature! Had you witne&s;&s;ed, as I have done, and &s;till do, the la&s;ting and &s;erious &s;orrows of his bo&s;om, your maternal remon&s;trance would have been addre&s;&s;ed to him, rather than to your unfortunate child. Often hath he regarded me with a fixed and melancholy attention: and when, alarmed and terri|fied, I have &s;ought the cau&s;e of his my&s;terious deport|ment, as if unable to command his grief, he hath fled with precipitation from my importunities. To induce
<PB N="195" REF="034162_0194_0FFC62247ACE5628">
him to di&s;clo&s;e the fatal &s;ecret of his heart, no means within my power have been left una&s;&s;ayed; and al|though failing in my well intended efforts, I have &s;till endeavoured to &s;oothe and woo his &s;teps to the &s;weet and flowery paths of peace.</P>
<P>With the &s;evere eye of unrelenting rigour, I have examined my own conduct: Probably I am under the dominion of <HI>&s;elf-partiality;</HI> for, in regard to him, I cannot view my&s;elf as reprehen&s;ible either in thought, word, or deed.</P>
<P>When, by your direction, I announced to him my expectation of pre&s;enting him with a little being, who would bring into the world with it, its claims to his fonde&s;t affections,&mdash;Oh, Madam! in&s;tead of the effect which we naturally imagined, the &s;orrows of his heart became ungovernable; with convul&s;ed and agonized emotions, he cla&s;ped his hands&mdash;Never &s;hall I forget his exclamation; it &s;ounded like a death-warrant to my ear&mdash;"<HI>Gracious God! wretch, wretch that I am!</HI>"&mdash;What he would have added, I know not; for, over|powered by my grief and my &s;urpri&s;e, I &s;unk lifele&s;s at his feet; and when, by his endeavours, and tho&s;e of the attendants whom he &s;ummoned to my relief, I was recalled to &s;en&s;e and to recollection, I found him kneeling by my bed &s;ide, a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly and tenderly em|ployed in my re&s;toration, and his tran&s;ports at behold|ing me, as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, once more open my eyes to love and to him, at &s;eeing the bloom again re|vi&s;it my cheeks, were, he declared, the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite he had ever experienced!</P>
<P>You will not doubt, that I &s;eized this tender mo|ment, to expo&s;tulate with him relative to his heart-af|fecting and &s;oul-piercing expre&s;&s;ions of grief, and con|tinued melancholy; but, although he beheld me, as I then &s;uppo&s;ed, with unabating affection, although he &s;oothed my &s;pirit by the mo&s;t delicate and unequivo|cal a&s;&s;urances, he neverthele&s;s turned a deaf ear to the voice of my &s;upplication! Edward Hamilton hath a &s;trong and determined mind; fortitude is innate in his bo&s;om; he can wear to the public eye, and even to
<PB N="196" REF="034162_0195_0FFC622251D66BE8">
the circle of his friends, a face of tranquillity, while his brea&s;t is a prey to the mo&s;t perturbed &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Fearful of di&s;gu&s;ting him by my per&s;ecutions, I ban|i&s;hed from my lips every expre&s;&s;ion of my anxiety; and, as far as was in my power, I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from my features the inquietude of my bo&s;om. I &s;tudied, by my every movement, his plea&s;ure; and I flattered my|&s;elf, that the birth of my child, by giving a new turn to his ideas, would re&s;tore my felicity. It is true that I had nothing to complain of, except the corroding grief, with which he evidently &s;truggled, and which, notwith&s;tanding his efforts to conceal it, was generally the companion of his private hours: For the re&s;t, I judged my&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart, and his de|portment was de&s;criptive of the mo&s;t refined and faith|ful attachment.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the days, until the arrival of my pang|ful hour. You, dear Madam, were a witne&s;s to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing agitation of his &s;oul, during that perilous and tremendous period; you heard and repeated his fervid vows for my &s;afety; they were mu&s;ic in my ears; doubtle&s;s they were &s;incere, for the heart of Edward Hamilton is as tender as it is manly. You al&s;o witne&s;&s;ed the rapt &s;en&s;ation of his grateful &s;pirit, when he received his &s;on; you heard and marked the paternal ble&s;&s;ings, which he poured upon his young|ling head; and, it is true, that the little creature is as dear to him, as the vital &s;park which warms him to exi&s;tence&mdash;<HI>but alas! this is the &s;um total of my enjoy|ments!</HI> The angui&s;h of heart, which is de&s;troying the <HI>father of my child,</HI> &s;eems daily to augment! The tears, of which he is apparently uncon&s;cious, often bedew the face of my infant! Frequently, as if by mutual con|&s;ent, we gaze in &s;ilent &s;orrow upon the dear innocent, and when Hamilton &s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf unob&s;erved, his eyes and hands are rai&s;ed toward heaven; and in all the maje&s;ty of innate woe, he pathetically makes his appeal to the Searcher of all hearts, while rectitude, it &s;hould &s;eem, is the motto of his life.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="034162_0196_0FFC6220CFEAD440">
Yet, I will not withhold &s;ome circum&s;tances, that have produced inferences, which my full &s;oul hath re|coiled at admitting. Alas, my mother! will you not e&s;teem me wretched, when I confe&s;s to you, that I have but too much rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>my&s;elf the origin of his misfortune.</HI></P>
<P>Some weeks after the birth of my little William, I was alarmed by the frequent ab&s;ence of Hamilton; and as I <HI>forbore any remarks thereon, being unwilling to embitter, by my expo&s;tulations, the few moments which he allowed me,</HI> I continued ignorant of the manner in which he appropriated his time. <HI>Accident,</HI> at length, informed me that all tho&s;e hours of which he had rob|bed me, were devoted to Serafina! and from her he always returned a prey to the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t fear|ful chagrin.</P>
<P>The &s;hock which my tenderne&s;s and my &s;en&s;ibility received, in a moment &s;o replete with angui&s;h, I a&s;|&s;ay not to de&s;cribe; but rea&s;on, I ble&s;s God, darted athwart the region of my &s;oul her beamy influence. Serafina was the &s;i&s;ter of my heart; &s;he was a lovely and an amiable woman. Edward and Serafina had been educated together from early life; their habits of intimacy were confirmed; and I con&s;idered, that if her &s;ociety po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more charms than mine, Edward was unfortunate, but not culpable.</P>
<P>I immediately formed the re&s;olution of &s;oliciting her to become an inmate in our hou&s;e; and when I made my propo&s;al to Hamilton, <HI>he received it with more &s;atis|faction than my feelings could well tolerate;</HI> he ki&s;&s;ed my hand with rapture; a gleam of joy vermilioned his cheek, and he flew to acquaint Mi&s;s Clifford with the wi&s;hes which I had expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Serafina too demon&s;trated the highe&s;t complacency; a re&s;i|dence with her Margaretta, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, would complete her felicity; and &s;he could not he&s;itate, when a &s;it|uation every way eligible way tendered to her acceptance.</HI></P>
<P>Our plan was no &s;ooner concerted than put into ex|ecution; Mi&s;s Clifford was e&s;tabli&s;hed in this man&s;ion, and Hamilton no longer wandered abroad! When I
<PB N="198" REF="034162_0197_0FFC621EA225FD38">
am pre&s;ent, Hamilton hath never, for a &s;ingle moment, abated his marked attentions to me; and he regards Serafina in his accu&s;tomed manner; but if I unex|pectedly join them, although they have apparently been engaged in the mo&s;t affectingly intere&s;ting con|ver&s;ation, they are immediately &s;ilent, embarra&s;&s;ed and unea&s;y!</P>
<P>The fine eyes of Serafina are often drowned in tears, and the grief of Hamilton &s;eems to know no bounds! Two weeks &s;ince, upon the morning of the day on which you &s;urpri&s;ed me yielding up my whole &s;oul to &s;orrow, &s;uppo&s;ing Hamilton in his clo&s;et, I took my needle-work, with a de&s;ign, while &s;itting be&s;ide him, to make one more effort to allure him into the &s;weet and flowery walks of tranquillity. He was not there&mdash;but an open piece of paper lying upon his &s;crutoire, written by the hand of Serafina, in which I &s;aw my name in large characters in&s;cribed, caught my atten|tion.

<P>SITTING, la&s;t evening, in the little apartment which I have devoted to plea&s;ures, properly term|ed &s;entimental, I was endeavouring, while Mary was &s;eated by my &s;ide, to amu&s;e the hours which &s;he em|ployed at her needle, by a re-peru&s;al of Gibbon's Roman Hi&s;tory. We had pa&s;&s;ed our afternoon, in a vain attempt to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of the infelicity of our daughter; we went over and over the ground, we traced and re-traced, we exhau&s;ted the powers of retro&s;pection, until wearied amid the wilds of conjec|ture, we attained the preci&s;e point from which we at fir&s;t &s;at off.</P>
<P>I had forborne to que&s;tion either Mr. or Mrs. Ham|ilton, imagining that the di&s;cretion of Margaretta mu&s;t inevitably become finally triumphant; and I conceived, be&s;ides, that any interference, con&s;idering the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility and delicate circum&s;tances of the parties, mu&s;t unavoidably increa&s;e the evil we lamented.</P>
<P>But to delineate the agonized perplexity which tempe&s;ted the bo&s;om of Mary, is impo&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the per|turbed &s;igh, humid cheek, and &s;woln eye, proclaimed the angui&s;h of her &s;pirit; while &s;he in vain endeavoured to rea&s;&s;ume the wonted fortitude and equability of her di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>La&s;t evening, however, wiping from her face the tear of maternal woe, and calling into action all tho&s;e efforts which it is the privilege of tender e&s;teem to embody, I &s;o far &s;ucceeded in my attempts to &s;oothe her mind, as to procure a temporary calm; and pre&s;&s;|ing, as an auxiliary, my admired hi&s;torian, my pur|po&s;e was to draw her off, at lea&s;t for the moment,
<PB N="201" REF="034162_0200_0FFA6535026CED08">
from the contemplation of the melancholy con&s;e|quences of her daughter's marriage.</P>
<P>We had but ju&s;t inve&s;ted our pen&s;ive <HI>tete-a-tete,</HI> with a degree of apparent &s;erenity, when Mrs. Hamilton, without being announced, ru&s;hed ha&s;tily into the apart|ment. Our a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;o unexpected a vi&s;it, was in no &s;ort abated by the wild extravagance of which her air and manner were de&s;criptive; it was, however, the mania of joy; and, without giving us time for re|flection or interrogation, throwing her&s;elf &s;uddenly at my feet, with cla&s;ped hands, and all the delirium of rapture, &s;he exclaimed&mdash;<Q>O Sir! O my father! ble&s;s, ble&s;s, your happy child!&mdash;delay not to be&s;tow your benediction upon this, the mo&s;t bli&s;sful period of her life; thus giving the paternal voice, to &s;anction and complete that mea&s;ure of felicity, which per|haps her wayward and de&s;ponding heart hath but ill de&s;erved.</Q></P>
<P>Alarmed and apprehen&s;ive, I would have folded her to my brea&s;t, at no moment he&s;itating to pronounce a ble&s;&s;ing, which was ever the &s;pontaneous dictate of my heart; but ere I could utter a word, &s;pringing up and ha&s;ting forward, &s;he threw her &s;nowy arms around the neck of Mary. <Q>O my mother, my more than mother! embrace your now not &s;orrow|ing, but perfectly a&s;&s;ured and extaticly enraptured Margaretta!</Q></P>
<P>Mary, alternately cla&s;ping her to her bo&s;om, and regarding her with looks of agonized terror, &s;truggled in vain for utterance; the impa&s;&s;ioned feelings of her &s;oul di&s;dained language, and the perturbed emotions which agitated her &s;pirit, were expre&s;&s;ed only by an affecting and de&s;criptive &s;ilence.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, I am free to own, that the &s;cene had al|mo&s;t unmanned me; and, that trembling equally for my wife and daughter, I could not have &s;upported it a moment longer. It was interrupted by the entrance of Edward Hamilton and Serafina. "Ah, my love!" cried Hamilton, <Q>why do you thus cruelly deprive me of your pre&s;ence; at a moment too, when you
<PB N="202" REF="034162_0201_0FFA6550355AA160">
have, as it were, renovated my exi&s;tence; when you have relieved me from a burthen that, by its mighty pre&s;&s;ure, had well near cru&s;hed my every hope of happine&s;s this &s;ide the eternal world; when you have new pointed every felicity, and taught me &s;till more highly to appreciate the ine&s;timable worth of your&s;elf, and of your ennobling affection! Were it po&s;&s;ible I could call my Margaretta unkind, her ab&s;ence at &s;uch a time, would be the only plea that could ju&s;tify my accu&s;ation. <HI>But who talks of accu|&s;ation?</HI> Margaretta, like the Being from whom &s;he originates, and who hath formed her a near re&s;em|blance of his ble&s;&s;ed &s;elf, <HI>unre&s;ervedly forgives;</HI> and, influenced al&s;o by an example &s;o fair, while urged by their own lenient benevolence, our revered bene|factors, parents, friends, will likewi&s;e conde&s;cend to &s;ign my acquittal; and thus their once almo&s;t de&s;|pairing culprit, re&s;tored to peace and to them, will new plume his hopes, and, re-embarking upon the voyage of life, he will tru&s;t that pro&s;perous gales may attend his once &s;hipwrecked pro&s;pects.</Q></P>
<P>Margaretta, encircled in the arms of her hu&s;band, bent her &s;weet face upon his bo&s;om, while Serafina, enthu&s;ia&s;tically pre&s;&s;ing her hands to her lips, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in broken &s;entences&mdash;<Q>Lovely and forgiving <HI>&s;i&s;ter!</HI> a &s;i&s;ter indeed! angelic Margaretta! May God in heaven greatly reward and forever ble&s;s my indulgent Margaretta.</Q></P>
<P>But not to fatigue the reader, by the incoherently agitated manner, in which we finally obtained an ex|planation of the&s;e my&s;terious appearances, I will piece together materials which, through many breaks and pau&s;es, I received, and pre&s;ent a &s;uccinct narrative of circum&s;tances, that have produced an ecclairci&s;ement, which hath rendered Margaretta, in her own e&s;tima|tion, the happie&s;t of women.</P>
<P>The opening dawn of ye&s;terday pre&s;ented a &s;erene autumnal morning, and the advancing day confirmed the plea&s;ing indications of its ro&s;y harbinger.</P>

The ripened fruits of autumn gathered in, the in|du&s;trious &s;wain once more hailed the interval which, crowning his hopes, permitted him to indulge a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of his labours; the very air, gently moving the motley foliage of the grove, impregnated with the &s;eeds of bland and &s;ocial peace, and di&s;burthened of the undulating and bu&s;y clang, &s;eemed to breathe the true &s;pirit of grateful and unmole&s;ted contemplation; while all varying nature apparently wore the &s;emblance of tranquillity.</P>
<P>Margaretta made the compari&s;on&mdash;&s;he could no longer &s;upport the dreadful contra&s;t which her bo&s;om exhibited; and, a&s;&s;erting her&s;elf, &s;he determined to be peremptory in her demand of an explanation. For many hours &s;he revolved her important purpo&s;e; her &s;pirit laboured with its intere&s;ting de&s;ign; her brea&s;t was the &s;eat of inquietude, and her &s;oul was heavily oppre&s;&s;ed. How to pre&s;ent her&s;elf; how to introduce her &s;ubject; in what language to clothe tho&s;e &s;orrows which &s;he had hitherto &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;ought to veil from the eye of Hamilton&mdash;the&s;e were que&s;tions which &s;trongly agitated every faculty of her mind; but all her attempts to concert a plan of operation were inef|fectual, until at length, tortured by reflection, he&s;itat|ing, trembling and irre&s;olute, &s;he bent her &s;teps toward that &s;aloon, which Edward had con&s;ecrated the &s;cene of his mo&s;t retired moments; thither, at certain hours of the day, &s;he knew that he repaired; upon this &s;oli|tude &s;he had never before ventured to intrude; yet, by &s;low and &s;olemn movements, urged by de&s;pair, &s;he now approached: She drew toward the rece&s;s, the door was but half clo&s;ed; Edward and Serafina, for the purpo&s;e of obtaining an uninterrupted conference, had pre|viou&s;ly retired there. Serafina was &s;eated on a &s;ofa, her face bathed in tears; Edward, evidently over|powered by grief, reclined by her &s;ide; he pre&s;&s;ed the left hand of Serafina to his lips, while her right was thrown affectionately over his &s;houlder!</P>
<P>"O Edward!" with a voice almo&s;t choaked by &s;orrow, exclaimed Mi&s;s Clifford, <Q>why are you thus
<PB N="204" REF="034162_0203_0FFC6553A69B4918">
unkindly per&s;evering? Fal&s;e &s;entiments betray you. My attachment to you is clo&s;ely interwoven with my exi&s;tence. I &s;tand upon the brink of a precipice, down which your unyielding obduracy will not fail to plunge me! Again I a&s;&s;ure you, that my happi|ne&s;s or mi&s;ery is involved in yours! If you become an exile from your country, doubtle&s;s I &s;hall be the companion of your flight; but whither &s;hall we go? in what rece&s;s can we hide our&s;elves? Is it po&s;&s;ible that we can voluntarily con&s;ign to irremediable ruin, the <HI>lovely and affectionate Margaretta?</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible that <HI>you, that a father,</HI> can deliberately re&s;olve to bla&s;t the ju&s;t budding pro&s;pects of him, who now, un|con&s;cious of the threatened danger, lulled in the cra|dle of innocence, &s;miles with cele&s;tial &s;weetne&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>Margaretta had entered unob&s;erved; &s;he had beheld the attitude of two per&s;ons whom &s;he had accu&s;tomed her&s;elf not only tenderly to love, but reveringly to e&s;|teem. The mo&s;t envenomed pangs of de&s;pair at that moment pervaded her bo&s;om&mdash;a feveri&s;h kind of an|gui&s;h &s;eemed to drink up the purple &s;tream of life&mdash;her voice was lo&s;t, and her &s;ight well near ab&s;orbed. Unable to proceed, &s;he &s;unk upon the ready &s;ettee, which the &s;econd &s;tep pre&s;ented&mdash;&s;he di&s;tinctly heard the exclamation of Serafina!!&mdash;and the powers of an|imation &s;u&s;pending their operations, &s;he &s;unk motion|le&s;s upon the &s;ettee&mdash;a &s;igh bur&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly from her bo&s;om&mdash;a &s;igh, that might well be imagined the immediate harbinger of death; it fir&s;t drew the atten|tion of Serafina&mdash;Hamilton &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and with mingling &s;urpri&s;e, angui&s;h and terror, they mutu|ally flew to the &s;uppo&s;ed expiring &s;ufferer. Their ap|plications were in part &s;ucce&s;sful; the active principle of life re&s;umed its functions, and a gradual re&s;u&s;citation pervaded the &s;y&s;tem. Rea&s;on, neverthele&s;s, as if in|dignant at the outrages which &s;he had &s;u&s;tained, &s;tood aloof; and it was but too evident, that Margaretta po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not that fine arrangement which had hith|erto regulated the feelings of her dignified and gen|tle mind.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="034162_0204_0FFC655223575148">
Her wanderings, however, imbibed the hue, and partook the prevailing bent of her natural di&s;po&s;ition; and amid her incoherent ramblings, the true &s;ituation of her &s;oul was expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In pathetic language &s;he lamented her own hard fate; and, addre&s;&s;ing Serafina, whom &s;he believed to be Mary, &s;he que&s;tioned her in regard to the propriety and eligibility of a &s;eparation from Edward. She &s;aid that her attachment to her hu&s;band could never know abatement; but (lowering her voice, as if fearful of being overheard) as he was devoted to another, &s;he thought it was becoming her character to relinqui&s;h her claims; &s;he wi&s;hed, indeed, that Edward and Mi&s;s Clifford had &s;ooner under&s;tood the nature of their mu|tual attachment&mdash;But perhaps they might have much to plead in their own defence; and that, for her part, though &s;he was at a lo&s;s to trace the origin of the ca|lamity which had overtaken her, and could not ju&s;tly accu&s;e her&s;elf of intentional error, yet &s;he wi&s;hed ev|ery body well. That they need not be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of abandoning the country; for if &s;he could but obtain one of tho&s;e mo&s;s-grown caverns, which &s;he had heard were &s;o numerous in the dominion of Old Ocean's God, in tho&s;e watery abodes &s;he would &s;eek her decea&s;ed father; po&s;&s;ibly too, her &s;upplications might draw down the &s;ainted &s;pirit of her injured mother; and if &s;he might be permitted to take with her the darling boy, for whom her la&s;t &s;igh would ari&s;e, they would be a family of love&mdash;&s;he would &s;oothe the woe-fraught bo&s;oms of her parents&mdash;&s;he would pre|pare for her infant &s;on an oozy bed, the &s;ea-green turf &s;hould pillow his little head, and, by the murmuring waters of &s;ome coral grove, he &s;hould be lulled to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Hamilton, agonized beyond expre&s;&s;ion, in the fren|zy of the moment, would have put a period to his ex|i&s;tence; but by Serafina, who is ever pre&s;ent to her|&s;elf, he was wooed, and awed to &s;ome degree of com|po&s;ure.</P>
<P>Serafina, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a faithful female, con|ducted Margaretta to her chamber; and, while &s;he
<PB N="206" REF="034162_0205_0FFC654D5BEBC038">
offered up to Heaven her &s;ilent and fervid vows for the perfect re&s;toration of her friend, &s;he availed her&s;elf of the idea &s;he entertained that &s;he was her mother; and, a&s;&s;uming the mildly commanding air, &s;he had &s;o frequently ob&s;erved Mary to wear, &s;he gently remon|&s;trated, pre&s;&s;ed and &s;oothed, until &s;he had placed Mrs. Hamilton upon her pillow, when, &s;eizing the exact cri&s;is, in the &s;ofte&s;t key, &s;he proceeded to chaunt the mo&s;t plaintive, harmonizing and dulcet &s;trains, within the compa&s;s of her mu&s;ical voice, until &s;he beheld the di&s;ordered mourner embraced by tho&s;e &s;lumbers, from which &s;he doubted not &s;he would awake, in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her charming intellects. Having thus ef|fectuated this &s;alutary purpo&s;e, leaving Margaretta to an attendant, her next care was to rejoin Hamilton.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible not to under&s;tand the nature of the &s;u&s;picions, which, it was apparent, had &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed the &s;oul of Margaretta; and a retro&s;pection convinced them, that even in the bo&s;om of apathy, rea&s;on, from a variety of circum&s;tances, would have originated conjectures. Edward acknowledged, that a de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;e demanded a deci&s;ive remedy; he trembled for the con&s;equences; but his deare&s;t hopes now pointed out the mo&s;t unre&s;erved confidence. Alas! had he known the heart of my daughter, how many pangs he might have &s;pared her. But the lim|ited pages of this publication forbid remarks.</P>
<P>Serafina, obtaining full power to act agreeably to her own di&s;cretion, returned to the chamber of Marga|retta, fraught with a &s;overeign &s;pecific for her wounded &s;pirit; when, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the girl, and &s;eating her&s;elf be|&s;ide her, &s;he impatiently waited her relea&s;e from that &s;alutary repo&s;e, to which &s;he had been &s;o &s;olicitous to con&s;ign her.</P>
<P>Margaretta at length opened her grief-&s;woln eyes; the traces of deep-felt melancholy were vi&s;ible in her countenance; but rea&s;on, it was evident, had re&s;umed her operations, and the expre&s;&s;ion of every feature was de&s;criptive of a mild and affecting kind of re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>"How are you, my &s;weet friend?" &s;oothingly que&s;tioned Serafina.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="034162_0206_0FFC654BD89198B8">
"Not well, Serafina;" returned Margaretta; and, after a moment's pau&s;e, letting fall &s;ome tears, in an affecting tone of voice, &s;he added; <Q>I am, Mi&s;s Clif|ford, the daughter of misfortune; my parentage was early announced; and though the interpo&s;ition of my ble&s;&s;ed friends and benefactors, would, by adopting me into their family, have &s;natched from me the bitter cup of adver&s;ity, yet, to &s;truggle again&s;t the unalterable decrees of an all-wi&s;e Providence, it is in vain we a&s;&s;ay!</Q></P>
<P>Serafina, inexpre&s;&s;ibly affected, delayed not her rem|edy, but immediately taking her hand, which &s;he be|dewed with her tears, &s;he delivered her&s;elf to the fol|lowing effect:&mdash;</P>
<Q><P>You are undoubtedly an angelic woman; hardly any lot could be con&s;idered as fully adequate to your uncommon merit; yet, if my admea&s;urement of the mind of Margaretta is ju&s;t, the &s;ecret which I have to communicate, will bani&s;h from her bo&s;om its mo&s;t corroding &s;orrows.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make my recital in as few words as po&s;&s;ible; and, although I may criminate the everla&s;tingly ab&s;ent, yet I will not be &s;o unju&s;t to my&s;elf, as to &s;uppo&s;e that the fact which I have to &s;tate, will le&s;&s;en me in your e&s;teem. The bo&s;om of my Margaretta is the natal habitation of candour; and, while I in|form her that Edward Hamilton and my&s;elf, owe our being to the &s;ame father, the &s;en&s;ation that is mo&s;t prevalent in my brea&s;t, is a plea&s;ing kind of con&s;cious pride.</P>
<P>While Mr. Hamilton, the elder, tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s in Europe, he &s;aw and di&s;tingui&s;hed my unfortunate mother. A circum&s;tantial narrative of the tender, though unwarrantable connexion, which was the con&s;equence, you will find in the&s;e &s;heets, <HI>which are the hand-writing of my father; the characters are familiar to your eye,</HI> and I yield them cheerfully to the peru&s;al of &s;ome &s;erene hour.</P>
<P>It appears, that the only fault of which my ill-fated mother could be accu&s;ed, was her unju&s;tifiable and
<PB N="208" REF="034162_0207_0FFC65489D544530">
fatal attachment to my father: the &s;truggles of her &s;oul were great; her &s;ufferings were accumulated; a number of <HI>extenuating facts</HI> the narrative faithfully records; and the filial feelings of a daughter's heart, naturally &s;ugge&s;t a per&s;ua&s;ion, that when, at the moment of my birth, &s;he yielded up her life, the &s;acrifice may be regarded as an expiation for her indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>My father called me by her name; and, return|ing to America, pre&s;ented me, then only &s;ix months old, to his lady, as an orphan, who&s;e per&s;on and for|tune were entru&s;ted to his care by her expiring pa|rents, and to whom he was determined to di&s;charge the part of a tender and faithful guardian.</P>
<P>The &s;oul of Mrs. Hamilton was the &s;eat of <HI>un&s;u&s;|pecting virtue,</HI> and &s;he received me to the bo&s;om of commi&s;erating affection; but I had not pa&s;&s;ed my third year, when this excellent lady was &s;ummoned to the man&s;ion prepared for her; and my father ex|changed no &s;econd vows. The attention which he paid to my education, hath often been remarked to you; and though, until I had completed my twelfth year, I viewed him only as my guardian friend, yet upon the tablets of my heart the &s;incere&s;t veneration for his character was in&s;cribed. Edward, born dur|ing the ab&s;ence of his father, had only one year the advantage of me, and it was on the twelfth return of my natal day, that, leading us to his library, and putting into my hands tho&s;e papers, which I have now committed to yours, he thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf: Receive&mdash;Serafina Clifford&mdash;and the big tear rolled down his venerable cheek&mdash;receive the recital of your mother's woes. I have marked, with a per|turbed and anxious kind of plea&s;ure, the uncommon attachment by which my children di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves; yours is the age of innocence, and your affections bud on the &s;tem of virtue; but a little on|ward, and the pa&s;&s;ions of youth too often a&s;&s;ume a baleful and fatal hue&mdash;the&s;e, alas! may perhaps pre|cipitate you into a gulph of ruin&mdash;I judge it
<PB N="209" REF="034162_0208_0FFC654608042B78">
proper to commit to you a <HI>&s;ecret</HI>&mdash;that I command you never, but in an hour of <HI>unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> to divulge&mdash;<HI>Know, Edward Hamilton, that Serafina Clifford is your &s;i&s;ter; &s;he is the daughter of your fa|ther&mdash;Know, Serafina Clifford, that Edward Hamilton is your brother; he is the &s;on of your father; and upon the heads of my children may the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven de|&s;cend!</HI> Here the emotions of his &s;oul became too big for utterance; he was unwilling to &s;ubmit them even to the eye of duteous affection, and he ha&s;tily withdrew.</P>
<P>For us, our bo&s;oms were awake only to the ming|ling &s;en&s;ations of &s;urpri&s;e and joy. I, for my part, never experienced a rapture &s;o &s;incere; and, no longer re&s;trained by the pre&s;ence of our father, we flew into each other's arms, eager to exchange tho&s;e vows of eternal amity, which we have ever &s;ince in|violably ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>With one half of his ample fortune, my father, by gifts, inve&s;titures and la&s;t te&s;tament, &s;crupulou&s;ly endowed me; and, as I enjoy no maternal inherit|ance, my every pecuniary emolument is derived from him: Yet, he &s;o well concerted his mea&s;ures, as to lead every one concerned to imagine, that he was only relinqui&s;hing a tru&s;t that had been repo&s;ed in him.</P>
<P>The remainder of my account I &s;hall pa&s;s rapidly over. When Mr. Courtland's preten&s;ions were ap|parently approbated by you, my brother, &s;truggling in vain to ri&s;e &s;uperior to an attachment, which he then deemed unfortunate, &s;ought a remedy in ab|&s;ence; and, flying for refuge to the &s;outhern States, melancholy, and almo&s;t de&s;pairing, he a&s;&s;ayed the various rounds of di&s;&s;ipation; gaming became his favourite amu&s;ement; and, in a few weeks, it is &s;carcely credible what immen&s;e &s;ums of money were &s;quandered! Mortifying embarra&s;&s;ments were the con&s;equence; and had it not been for the extraordi|nary interpo&s;ition of a friend of uncommon merit, his immediate ruin would have &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="034162_0209_0FFC6541D03064D8">
Viewing him&s;elf, however, as young, and uncon|nected, he was prepared to meet the frowns of for|tune; and &s;uppo&s;ing he had obtained the cure of a pa&s;&s;ion, that had gained &s;trength with almo&s;t every added year of his life, he returned home, well plea&s;ed with his expedition. The event proved what an er|roneous calculation he had made; and when he re|ceived your hand at the altar, he tru&s;ted that future &s;ucce&s;&s;es, economy and application, would retrieve his affairs. What &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;every month he hath accumulated misfortunes; and the rapid decline of his finances hath operated as a &s;evere check upon his deare&s;t plea&s;ures. When you communicated to him your expectation of augmenting his felicity, by pre&s;enting him an invaluable pledge of love, he was then &s;truggling under the pre&s;&s;ure of a recent di&s;ap|pointment; he reflected upon him&s;elf as a prodigal, who had wa&s;ted the patrimony of the unborn. You mu&s;t recollect his unguarded and impa&s;&s;ioned expre&s;|&s;ions, with the alarming effects which they produced upon you. He accu&s;es him&s;elf as a wretch who hath deceived you; and he is mi&s;erable. The generous forbearance of his &s;outhern friend, hath hitherto up|held him; but that benevolent creditor hath him&s;elf become a bankrupt, and the &s;tate of my brother's af|fairs can no longer be concealed. My lovely &s;i&s;ter mu&s;t &s;oon have known, that her hu&s;band is &s;ome thou&s;ands in arrears, which he hath not a &s;hilling to di&s;charge. My fortune would completely rein&s;tate him; often have I tendered it&mdash;Interrupt me not, my love;&mdash;for Margaretta was eager to expre&s;s her feelings; I have written, I have repeatedly re|mon&s;trated: To effectuate this favourite purpo&s;e of my &s;oul, I have revolved a variety of plans; my nights have been &s;pent in tears, and my days in at|tempts to conceal from you my chagrin.</P>
<P>Edward is withheld, by fal&s;e principles of delicacy, from availing him&s;elf of what the laws of his coun|try, but for the regulations of his father, would un|doubtedly have inve&s;ted him with: Gladly would I
<PB N="211" REF="034162_0210_0FFC65404DBCCCC8">
commit my&s;elf wholly into the hands of my brother. The good or evil which awaits him, I would wi&s;h to &s;hare; I would have but one intere&s;t between us, and I would be regarded only as the &s;i&s;ter of his heart.</P>
<P>But for him, he &s;tyles him&s;elf a wretch who hath deceived and betrayed you, and, under this appella|tion, he &s;huns your pre&s;ence; he cannot bear to ap|pear before your parents, the victim of extravagance; he meditates ab&s;conding from. America, and if he cannot be induced to relinqui&s;h his de&s;ign, his &s;i&s;ter will bear him company in exile: But if matters can be adju&s;ted, Edward may receive my intere&s;t, at lea&s;t as a loan. If Margaretta can forgive, and will be|come my auxiliary, &s;he may yet po&s;&s;e&s;s tranquillity; and &s;he will en&s;ure to her&s;elf the eternal gratitude of two per&s;ons, who will, upon all occa&s;ions, devote them&s;elves to the promotion of her felicity.</P></Q>
<P>As Mi&s;s. Clifford proceeded in her narrative, Mar|garetta had quitted her couch; &s;he had continued highly agitated, traver&s;ing up and down her apart|ment. Now her cla&s;ped hands, rai&s;ed eyes, and accel|erated movements, expre&s;&s;ed the big emotions which &s;truggled in her bo&s;om; now &s;he threw abroad her hands in admiration, and now rai&s;ed them to Heaven, in a delirium of joy: Vehemently &s;eizing the fir&s;t pau&s;e, &s;he repeated&mdash;<Q><HI>Tranquillity!</HI>&mdash;Gracious God!&mdash;Can Serafina Clifford Hamilton&mdash;my divine &s;i&s;|ter&mdash;my angel friend&mdash;my peace-&s;peaking, hope in|&s;piring genius&mdash;can <HI>&s;he give &s;o cold a term to the ex|tatic rapture of this bli&s;sful moment?</HI> Creator, and Almighty Pre&s;erver of my life, how have I de&s;erved this fullne&s;s of felicity, which, like a mighty torrent, now bur&s;ts upon me? O Edward! my <HI>faultle&s;s, my injured hu&s;band!</HI> but in&s;tantly, on my knees, I will &s;upplicate the benign tenderne&s;s of that manly bo|&s;om, to intercede in my favour.</Q></P>
<P>Margaretta glided through the pa&s;&s;age&mdash;Hamilton met her in an adjoining chamber; where, with a per|turbed and anxious &s;pirit, he had waited the re&s;ult of what he termed the cri&s;is of his fate. It was not in
<PB N="212" REF="034162_0211_0FFC653CD04EF8F8">
his power to prevent the humble po&s;ture of his charm|ing wife; Margaretta bent before him; and, with &s;treaming eyes and &s;upplicating hands, be&s;ought his pardon for the error, into which a ha&s;ty, inexperienced and &s;u&s;picious &s;pirit had precipitated her. Edward in vain a&s;&s;ayed to rai&s;e her; by the events of the day her rea&s;on was &s;till in a degree di&s;ordered, and &s;he in|&s;i&s;ted upon receiving her forgivene&s;s in form.</P>
<P>"My God!" cried Edward, flinging him&s;elf be&s;ide her, <Q>this is too much; receive once more your of|fending Hamilton; endeavour to era&s;e from thy lovely bo&s;om every painful remembrance of his pa&s;t irregularities, and you may then number him among the happie&s;t of human beings. Dearer to my &s;oul than the light of heaven, my Margaretta hath ever been: All amiably con&s;i&s;tent; and mildly good as &s;he is, &s;he hath not, &s;he never could be found in a reprehen&s;ible walk; and con&s;equently, her hu&s;band mu&s;t have marked her progre&s;s with an approbating eye; con&s;equently, he can have nothing to con|demn, nothing to forgive.</Q></P>
<P>The appearance of Mi&s;s Clifford &s;u&s;pended the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> tender contention; and Margaretta embraced the op|portunity of ha&s;ting to impart to us, the a&s;toni&s;hing change which had taken place in her favour.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent &s;cene, in my reading parlour, nat|urally re&s;ulted; and, I only add, that if there are, who do not greatly admire, and highly applaud the une|quivocal demon&s;trations of joy, with which my daugh|ter received the knowledge, that &s;he mu&s;t relinqui&s;h the independence of affluence, and de&s;cend to the hum|bling grade, which <HI>&s;canty and precarious circum&s;tances enrolls,</HI>&mdash;I pity the frigidity of their bo&s;oms.</P>

<P>MY mind, much occupied and greatly exerci&s;ed, by the deranged &s;tate of Mr. Hamilton's af|fairs, together with &s;ome other very painful and deep|ly lacerating events, hath not found it&s;elf at liberty to pur&s;ue, with wonted avidity, its accu&s;tomed avocations.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, as a &s;ub&s;titute for the &s;ubject on which I had intended to expatiate, I pre&s;ent, for the pe|ru&s;al of the reader, the contents of a folded paper I
<PB N="214" REF="034162_0213_0FFC6538D7A59E90">
lately picked up, in one of my &s;olitary rambles; and which, being without a &s;ignature, it is not in my pow|er to re&s;tore, in any other way, to its original proprie|tor. The &s;entiments and language of this little per|formance, are evidently the devout and &s;pontaneous breathings of a chri&s;tianized mind. And, as I think that the piece, altogether, may properly enough be characterized, a Eulogy upon the month of December, I have cho&s;en to chri&s;ten this Gleaner by the name of that celebrious portion of time.</P>
<P>[<HI>Here followeth the Paper.</HI>]</P>
<P>"DECEMBER&mdash;it is true thou ha&s;t been fruitful to me of misfortunes; many a time ha&s;t thou lacerat|ed my bo&s;om, by ravi&s;hing from me my deare&s;t enjoy|ments; thou ha&s;t &s;tabbed me in the tendere&s;t part, and thy broadly wild and congealing eye hath &s;eemed to glut it&s;elf with my tears; into thy frozen ear it is in vain that I have poured my &s;orrows; harder than adamant, thou &s;eeme&s;t to arre&s;t the &s;tream of pity, and thou regarde&s;t my lamentations with &s;tern and unre|lenting &s;everity; thy &s;torms have been as a whirlwind to my &s;oul; and thy tempe&s;ts, up-rooting my peace, have well near whelmed, beneath the barren heaths of de&s;pair, my every hope.</P>
<P>Fell De&s;poiler I have called thee&mdash;for thy hoary vi&s;age hath &s;till for me been marked with terror&mdash;But hark! what &s;weet voice is that which i&s;&s;ues from yon|der Angel of peace?&mdash;it &s;oothes my &s;pirit by the mo&s;t con&s;olatory a&s;&s;urances&mdash;rea&s;on and religion it com|bines&mdash;with the Shepherd of I&s;rael the commi&s;&s;ion originates&mdash;and, with bland and gentle pity, deep in my bo&s;om it implants immortal Hope.</P>
<P>December&mdash;ble&s;t era!&mdash;thou art the natal month of the <HI>Saviour of the world&mdash;Let thy winds convey my individual &s;ufferings</HI> to that oblivion, to which the Re|deemer hath, eventually, con&s;igned the woes of the exonerated children of men.</P>
<P>To the private con&s;iderations of corroding &s;orrow, let me no longer li&s;ten&mdash;Let me gird up the loins of

my mind, and look forward to that bli&s;sful con&s;um|mation, the dawning of which was pre&s;ented in thy admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Hail! returning period&mdash;white-garbed month!&mdash;thou &s;halt ever be right welcome to my devoted bo|&s;om&mdash;Every moment which con&s;titutes thy admea&s;ure|ment, &s;hould be con&s;ecrated as &s;acred to the mo&s;t re|fined enjoyments of the &s;oul&mdash;Henceforth, waving my accumulated griefs, I will love thy flaky foot&s;teps&mdash;I will anticipate their approach; and my &s;pirit &s;hall &s;o|lace it&s;elf, by a confiding view of the accompli&s;hment of that arrangement, which was de&s;ignated in thy ap|portioned round.</P>
<P>December&mdash;ble&s;t period!&mdash;mo&s;t illu&s;trious in the order of time!&mdash;thou containe&s;t the natal day of the Son of God&mdash;and thy broad encircling eye extende&s;t from the man of paradi&s;e, to that infant who &s;hall late&s;t &s;well the &s;igh of humanity.</P>
<P>Yes, I will love thy flaky foot&s;teps&mdash;darkne&s;s can|not over&s;hadow thee&mdash;Thy &s;hades but &s;erve to render the brightening &s;plendours of thy cour&s;e the more con|&s;picuous. <HI>The natal day of the Son of God!</HI>&mdash;what records have engraven &s;o &s;tupendous, &s;o &s;alutary, &s;o momentous a truth!&mdash;Thy hours regi&s;ter his birth&mdash;the birth of the Prince of Peace&mdash;During thy prog|re&s;s, the Virgin brought forth her <HI>fir&s;t-born &s;on</HI>&mdash;and renovated nature &s;miled extatic&mdash;healing breezes cha&s;e the chills of winter&mdash;and cele&s;tial &s;pirits clu&s;ter round the haunts of men.</P>
<P>Soft as the vernal &s;hower his doctrine di&s;tilled&mdash;and the plant of perfection attained maturity&mdash;From the &s;torm he is a Hiding Place&mdash;and the burning eye of Divine Ju&s;tice can never pierce that invulnerable en|velopement, by which he hath encompa&s;&s;ed the &s;ons and daughters of men&mdash;Sickne&s;s fleeth before him, and imbecility dwelleth not with him&mdash;Evil &s;hall be exterminated from his dominion&mdash;rectitude &s;hall ad|mini&s;ter unto him&mdash;peace &s;hall erect an immortal &s;tandard&mdash;and innocence, adorned with chaplets of equity, &s;hall be the gift of the Mo&s;t High.</P>

<P>TAKING my &s;eat, the other evening, in a front box at the play-hou&s;e, I was, previous to the drawing up of the curtain, not a little amu&s;ed by the chit-chat of a couple of &s;prightly girls, who occupied &s;eats at my right hand. The hou&s;e, the company, and the expected entertainment, alternately engaged their attention. I found, by their conver&s;ation, that they, as well as my&s;elf, were &s;trangers in the metropo|lis, and that the witne&s;&s;ing the repre&s;entation of a play, was rather an extraneous occurrence in their catalogue of enjoyments.</P>
<P>"In the name of wonder, &s;i&s;ter Peggy," exclaimed the younge&s;t of the girls, "who is that figure that &s;eems placed as a &s;entinel over yonder avenue, and who is at the &s;ame time &s;o curiou&s;ly bandeaued, that one might be ready to imagine him ju&s;t &s;tarting off upon a game of blind-man's buff?" "That figure? &s;i&s;ter Clary," replied Peggy, "why that figure, my dear, is the figure of Ju&s;tice." "O my con&s;cience, &s;i&s;ter," cried Clary, "<HI>Ju&s;tice, do you &s;ay?</HI> Why &s;urely, Peggy, you mu&s;t have made a mon&s;trous blunder; for I have heard a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times, that <HI>Ju&s;|tice</HI> was nothing but eyes, and that &s;he could &s;ee every way at once." "You are thinking of Argus, Clary: The poets indeed de&s;cribe him with his hundred eyes; but <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> believe me, is always painted blind." "Poh, poh, Peggy, you are certainly in the wrong; or, if it is as you &s;ay, your great writers, or painters, or who|ever they be, mu&s;t certainly all have been in a dream: Why I would not &s;uffer a blind man to choo&s;e me a &s;et of ribbons, much le&s;s &s;hould he decide upon a que&s;|tion
<PB N="218" REF="034162_0217_0FFC652EB3FEE1F0">
which involved my life, my character, or even my e&s;tate."</P>
<P>The girl's ob&s;ervation was the &s;pontaneous lan|guage of nature, and truth and nature are generally upon the &s;ame &s;ide.</P>
<P>How long my fair neighbours continued their enter|taining confab. I know not, for the ingenuity of Clary, throwing me into a train of thinking, from which I was only rou&s;ed by the appearance of the players, I unfortunately lo&s;t the remainder of their remarks.</P>
<P>The &s;entiments of the lively Clary are certainly authorized by rea&s;on. Fortune is de&s;cribed as blind; and &s;he is &s;aid to be&s;tow her benefactions mo&s;t capri|ciou&s;ly. The rich, it is thought, con&s;idered in the ag|gregate, derive not their claim to the di&s;tinctions with which they are inve&s;ted, from the &s;uffrage of virtue; Fortune is frequently lavi&s;h of her favours to vice, while the good man is &s;een &s;truggling with all tho&s;e ills which are the accompaniments of penury. Yet did Fortune always thus de&s;ignate, we might be ready to &s;ay &s;he had undoubtedly the gift of &s;ight, and that the depravity of her ta&s;te led her to &s;elect her favour|ites from the children of error. But to &s;hield her god|de&s;s&s;hip from a conclu&s;ion &s;o derogatory to her mor|al character, in&s;tances may be produced, where the votaries of rectitude ba&s;k in the &s;un&s;hine of her &s;miles; integrity is &s;ometimes crowned by her with affluence, and the upright, being liberally endowed, are appoint|ed to admini&s;ter to the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;ons and daugh|ters of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>Fortune, moreover, is extremely variable in her di&s;po&s;itions, and in the con&s;tant revolutions of her wheel, tho&s;e who are to-day &s;tanding tip-toe, upon the highe&s;t eminence, may to-morrow be precipitated into the aby&s;s of entanglements, embarra&s;&s;ments, and com|fortle&s;s de&s;pair. Ingenious therefore is the allegory which permits us to attribute the caprice of Fortune to her deficiency of vi&s;ion; and tho&s;e ancients were happy, who, thus regarding her di&s;tributions, con&s;oled them&s;elves in the deprivation of her favours, by the
<PB N="219" REF="034162_0218_0FFC652B2AD076E8">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that intrin&s;ic worth, which it is not in the power of &s;o uncertain a being to de&s;ignate or to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>But whatever may be urged for veiling the optics of dame Fortune, is undoubtedly point blank again&s;t hood-winking the godde&s;s Themis, or Ju&s;tice. I am aware that the deci&s;ions of Ju&s;tice &s;hould ever be im|partial, and that her vi&s;ual ray is &s;aid to be thrown into the &s;hade, to prevent the bias in favour of appear|ances, that her judgment would otherwi&s;e have receiv|ed; but it &s;hould be remembered that Ju&s;tice, <HI>dive&s;t of fable,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t dignified attributes of Deity; that it partakes the nature of its augu&s;t Original; and that it is, by con&s;equence, infinitely &s;uperior to party.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice is enthroned far above all law, &s;ince no hu|man arrangements can take cognizance of every po&s;&s;i|ble event, and much mu&s;t at all times be left to the &s;pontaneous dictates of this illu&s;trious vicegerent of Omnipotence.</P>
<P>Were I to per&s;onify Ju&s;tice, in&s;tead of pre&s;enting her <HI>blind,</HI> I would denominate her the godde&s;s of fire; &s;he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ubtle e&s;&s;ence, which &s;hould pene|trate through, and pervade the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the &s;oul; by every in&s;ignia of light I would &s;urround and de&s;ignate her; while among the ornaments which compo&s;ed her cre&s;t, a broad and never clo&s;ing eye &s;hould &s;tand con&s;picuous; &s;he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the pow|er to unravel the knotty entanglements of the mo&s;t &s;o|phi&s;ticated web; piercing as the forked lightning, in|&s;tantaneous and penetrating, &s;he &s;hould di&s;clo&s;e, at a &s;ingle glance, the &s;ecret and crooked windings of the mo&s;t profound labyrinth, while, patient and unerring, &s;he &s;hould li&s;ten with calmne&s;s to the various di&s;qui&s;i|tions of the intere&s;ted claimant; and, careful to inve&s;|tigate, her deci&s;ions &s;hould always accord with her own important nature and office.</P>
<P>Uniform in her awards, neither youth, beauty, nor innocence, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a charm to &s;often her firm in|flexibility; dignity, age, the venerable head of &s;now, the&s;e &s;hould not awe; adver&s;ity &s;hould not excite an
<PB N="220" REF="034162_0219_0FFC65298C0C1758">
<HI>improper compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> nor &s;hould the tears of the widow, or of the orphan, unduly per&s;uade. Of unbending integrity, Ju&s;tice &s;hould <HI>feel, hear and &s;ee,</HI> but <HI>truth</HI> alone &s;hould be the pole &s;tar, by which &s;he &s;hould &s;hape her movements, and equity only &s;hould con&s;train her determinations. To the ravages of wayward pa&s;|&s;ions &s;he &s;hould be at all times &s;uperior; and her ad|mini&s;tration &s;hould be under the regulation of wi&s;dom. Elevated beings are di&s;honoured by the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they can po&s;&s;ibly be influenced by improper or foreign repre&s;entations, and my delineation of Ju&s;tice, armed at all points, &s;hould be inacce&s;&s;ible even to the <HI>&s;u&s;picion</HI> of imbecility.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t and dignified delegate of the great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e! to thee the nations appeal, whatever form their governments may a&s;&s;ume, whether democratical, repub|lican, oligarchal, monarchical, or de&s;potical&mdash;&s;till they are careful to give their doings the inve&s;titure of thy &s;acred name; they affect thy &s;anction, they arre&s;t thy ti|tles; the violation of thy laws, is the <HI>o&s;ten&s;ible</HI> rea&s;on for the battles which they &s;eek; and, a&s;&s;uming thy ban|ners, they anticipate &s;ucce&s;s, exulting in victories, which, agreeably to thy allotments, the iniquity of their cau&s;e may forbid their ever obtaining. Nor is the general di&s;po&s;ition of great events alone under thy direction; thou take&s;t cognizance of the minutiae of human life, and with an unerring hand, thou directe&s;t all tho&s;e occurrences in the career of being, which the infidel is accu&s;tomed to a&s;cribe to the agency of a blind and unde&s;cribable chance. To thee the good man rai&s;es the eye of confidence; virtue is &s;ure of thy award; and the oppre&s;&s;ed of all ages have flown to thee for refuge.</P>
<P>Thus far I had written, aiming, gentle reader, at thy amu&s;ement&mdash;when Edward Hamilton looked in upon me. "You are bu&s;y, Sir, and I will not inter|rupt you." No, my &s;on, I have always lei&s;ure to receive your vi&s;its. Sit down, Sir, and unfold the tale, to which your perplexed countenance is a preface.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="034162_0220_0FFA652B6A047458">
"I come, Sir, to take your direction in regard to the line of conduct which the untoward &s;tate of my affairs renders it proper for me to pur&s;ue." I threw down my pen which I had till then held in my fingers; and, gra&s;ping his hand, I eagerly exclaimed&mdash;<HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> Sir, <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> mu&s;t be your guide&mdash;you are an excellent young man, Mr. Hamilton; and I am happy in the a&s;&s;urance, that you will find no difficulty in following the cour&s;e of the radiant director, which I take the liberty to point out as the guardian of your every &s;tep. Endear|ed as you are to me, Sir, your very fault, the occa&s;ion con&s;idered, &s;erving to intere&s;t me &s;till more in your happine&s;s, I could at this moment with plea&s;ure dive&s;t my&s;elf of my little inheritance in your favour: Start not, Sir, (for he was extremely agitated at this &s;ug|ge&s;tion) con&s;iderations of tenderne&s;s to the <HI>unborn,</HI> for|bid my taking this &s;tep, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of her fa|ther, mu&s;t be &s;ecured to the children of our Margaret|ta. I approve much of your declining to avail your|&s;elf of the genero&s;ity of Mi&s;s Clifford. <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> would redden indignant at &s;uch a &s;acrifice. <HI>Nature,</HI> howev|er, legi&s;lators may have ordained, gave that young lady a right to the patrimony &s;he enjoys; and your fraternal affection ought not to &s;uffer you to ri&s;k prop|erty, the lo&s;s of which would render &s;o amiable a wo|man dependent and unea&s;y.</P>
<P>Such, my &s;on, hath been the uniform integrity of your commercial tran&s;actions, that, to abridge you of your liberty, not a &s;ingle creditor will pre&s;ent him&s;elf.

this hou&s;e is large, and the hearts of your parents are open to receive you; hither, until the &s;torm be over|blown, you mu&s;t retire; and by the re&s;toration of that &s;ociety, the lo&s;s of which, I do a&s;&s;ure you, we have not cea&s;ed &s;ecretly to regret, our dome&s;tic enjoyments will be inexpre&s;&s;ibly advanced. <HI>Fortune is blind,</HI> and her di&s;po&s;itions are extremely variable; you mu&s;t per|&s;everingly pur&s;ue her; po&s;&s;ibly &s;he may relent, and &s;hould &s;he in future be&s;tow upon you her gifts, you mu&s;t not fail to di&s;charge, to the la&s;t farthing, every ju&s;t demand which can be made upon you. I ble&s;s God that your own habits, and upright way of think|ing, will irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;timulate you upon this occa&s;ion. Bankrupt and limitation acts may &s;ucceed each other, and all the&s;e may be very well in their place; but the hone&s;t man will hear the voice of Ju&s;tice, he will bend his ear attentive to her pleadings, and Virtue will be the motto of his actions.</P>
<P>Fame once wafted to my ear, a little narrative, which indelibly impre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mind; and I have never reflected upon it, without the accompaniment of an exqui&s;ite kind of complacency. I will give it you, my &s;on, as an example.</P>
<P>A gentleman, engaged in the mercantile line, had followed bu&s;ine&s;s with little &s;ucce&s;s; his integrity, his efforts, and his abilities were unque&s;tionable, and for many years they enabled him to make head again&s;t a tide of misfortunes, which would have overwhelmed a common capacity; his creditors them&s;elves, well con|vinced of the propriety and frugality of his arrange|ments, readily contributed the means, which his con|tinued lo&s;&s;es only converted into an accumulation of his arrears. Weary, at length, of a warfare that fate &s;eemed to render &s;o unequal, he &s;ummoned all tho&s;e to whom he &s;tood indebted, and forcing upon them, according to the amount of their demands, an exact proportion of the intere&s;t which remained with him; after thus voluntarily dive&s;ting him&s;elf of every &s;hil|ling of property, he found, to his great regret, that it was only adequate to the di&s;charging of a very &s;mall
<PB N="223" REF="034162_0222_0FFC6524DB40D268">
part of his arrears; he received, however, from his approbating creditors, receipts in full; and, thus ex|onerated in the e&s;timation of the law, he very &s;oon made up his mind, relative to his future de&s;tination. A generous friend &s;upplied him with a &s;mall &s;um, by the means of which he embarked upon a foreign voy|age; pro&s;perous gales &s;oon wafted him to his de&s;ired port, and he pre&s;ented him&s;elf with &s;uch credentials as he merited. Shake&s;peare &s;ays, there is a tide in men's affairs! he had embraced the favourable moment of opportunity; every thing he undertook was pro&s;per|ous; all his tran&s;actions were marked and crowned by &s;ucce&s;s, and a few years &s;aw him ma&s;ter of a very hand&s;ome property. He had kept no corre&s;pondence with his friends during what he termed his period of exile; but he no &s;ooner attained that independence, af|ter which his noble &s;pirit had &s;o long and &s;o ardently &s;ighed, than he departed in a &s;hip of his own, richly freighted, full &s;peed for his native country. Inform|ation of his return was conveyed to his creditors, through the medium of a card, &s;oliciting their pre&s;ence at a public hou&s;e, to partake of an entertainment which he had ordered for them. His creditors remembered him as an unfortunate, but an hone&s;t man, who&s;e ar|rival they &s;hould gladly welcome, and they obeyed with avidity his &s;ummons. The fir&s;t compliments were marked by mutual expre&s;&s;ions of &s;atisfaction, and from the lips of the welcome claimants the warme&s;t gratulations &s;pontaneou&s;ly i&s;&s;ued. A &s;uperb dinner, with much elegance, was &s;erved up, and the covers being removed, the bottle was bri&s;kly pu&s;hed about; but who can expre&s;s their a&s;toni&s;hment, when, in the mid&s;t of their hilarity, every man was pre&s;ented with the full &s;um he had &s;o formally relinqui&s;hed, together with every &s;hilling of intere&s;t, which would have been legally due, had they received promi&s;&s;ory notes in&s;tead of the relea&s;es they had &s;o voluntarily given! A gen|erous contention immediately en&s;ued; but our mer|chant convincing his friends of his ability, they finally yielded to his remon&s;trances.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="034162_0223_0FFC6521A5DE5218">
They were, however, determined to exhibit a monu|ment of their admiration and their gratitude; and they &s;olicited and obtained permi&s;&s;ion of the govern|ment to erect, in a public &s;tand, a magnificent obeli&s;k, the faces of which were in&s;cribed with the name of the upright debtor, and with a circum&s;tantial account of the whole tran&s;action.</P>
<P>How much more honorary is a virtuous fame, than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of hou&s;es or of lands.

<P>THE various parterres, now putting forth their promi&s;ing buds, in many &s;ections, in this our country, looks with a very favourable a&s;pect upon a man of my profe&s;&s;ion; and I cannot but hope, that in the occupation of a Gleaner, I &s;hall be able to cull many a fragrant flower, wherewith to compo&s;e a bou|quet, that may throw an agreeable perfume over the lei&s;ure hours of the &s;entimental &s;peculator.</P>
<P>To <HI>expre&s;s my&s;elf le&s;s technically.</HI> The progre&s;s of the Drama, in this new world, mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly intere&s;t the feelings of every ob&s;erver; and, being under the plea&s;|ing nece&s;&s;ity, in the routine of my excur&s;ions, of vi&s;it|ing many parts of the United States, and thus, having frequent opportunities of pre&s;enting my&s;elf in our &s;ev|eral theatres, from the elegant hou&s;e in Philadelphia to the temporary re&s;orts of itinerant companies, in tho&s;e little country towns, which will invariably copy the examples they receive from the metropolis, I nat|urally,
<PB N="225" REF="034162_0224_0FFC651FDBA9AA40">
in the cour&s;e of my perambulations, pick up many ob&s;ervations, that may po&s;&s;ibly &s;erve for the amu&s;ement of my readers.</P>
<P>The great que&s;tion which does, and <HI>ought</HI> to occupy the mind of every patriotic morali&s;t, is the <HI>utility</HI> of licen&s;ed &s;tage-playing. Perhaps I may as well with|draw the word <HI>licen&s;ed;</HI> for, in the pre&s;ent enlightened era and admini&s;tration of liberty, the citizen would hardly con&s;ent to an abridgment of tho&s;e amu&s;ements, the evil tendency of which could not be unequivocally demon&s;trated to his under&s;tanding; and the late &s;trug|gle in the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, evinces the futility of erecting barriers, not &s;ub&s;tantiated by rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The law in that State was outraged in its very face: the flim&s;y &s;ubterfuge of <HI>moral lectures</HI> deceived no one; and though, as I am informed, the theatrical prohibition is but <HI>partially repealed re&s;pecting the Bo&s;to|nians, and remains in full force upon the re&s;t of the State,</HI> yet it is notorious, that itinerant players are con&s;tantly marching and counter-marching from town to town, to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of the good people of this very re&s;pectable member of the Union. But, without pre&s;uming to intermeddle with the policy of the legi&s;|lature, my de&s;ign is, to hazard a few remarks upon the &s;ubject in general.</P>
<P>As I abhor the domination of prejudice, and, upon the &s;tronge&s;t conviction, regard it as a tyrant, that if once brought to the guillotine, would <HI>(provided it is not of the Hydra kind)</HI> leave an opening for the intro|duction of an era far more friendly to the progre&s;s of <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>corrected</HI> liberty, than the murder of all the <HI>humane, virtuous,</HI> and <HI>religious princes in the univer&s;e;</HI> &s;o I mo&s;t &s;incerely deprecate its de&s;poti&s;m; and when|ever I &s;eat my&s;elf, with the pen of inquiry, I am &s;o|licitous to rai&s;e a rebellion again&s;t encroachments, that, however &s;anctioned by time, cannot, in my opinion, be con&s;idered in a court of equity, as legal or natural. The objections to theatrical amu&s;ements are many and plau&s;ible. I pretend not to decide for others; I would only inve&s;tigate.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="034162_0225_0FFC651D77BDB6E0">
If I mi&s;take not&mdash;<HI>Wa&s;te of time&mdash;Imprudent expen|ditures&mdash;Encouragement of idlene&s;s</HI>&mdash;and, <HI>Relaxation of morals,</HI> &s;tand foremo&s;t in the catalogue of objections.</P>
<P><HI>Prodigality of time,</HI> is indeed an irremediable evil; and if it can be proved, that an hour devoted to the theatre would certainly have been appropriated to any beneficial employment, for which no moment of lei&s;|ure will in future pre&s;ent, I, for one, &s;hall be impelled to allow the validity of the allegation; and, I do hereby inve&s;t &s;uch plea with full authority to detain every &s;uch per&s;on from all dramatical repre&s;entations whatever: But, with the &s;ame breath I contend, that tho&s;e evenings which are immolated at the &s;hrine of Bacchus, which are loitered in a tavern, in unnece&s;&s;ary go&s;&s;iping, cards, &s;candal, and the numerous vagaries of fa&s;hion, will be <HI>comparatively redeemed,</HI> if marked by an entertainment &s;o incontrovertibly rational.</P>
<P><HI>The complaint of exorbitant expenditures,</HI> is of a &s;imilar de&s;cription. A friend of mine, who re&s;ided for &s;ome time abroad, once informed me, that he had frequent|ly been &s;topped, when in full career to the play-hou&s;e, by a con&s;ideration that the indulgence he was about to procure him&s;elf, would &s;upply &s;ome tearful &s;ufferer with bread, for at lea&s;t one whole week. Now, all &s;uch per&s;ons, provided they can make it appear, they are not in the u&s;e of any <HI>as expen&s;ive and more &s;uperflu|ous gratification,</HI> &s;hall be relea&s;ed, upon their parole given, that they will ab&s;olutely and <HI>bona fide</HI> employ their &s;ix &s;hillings to the afore&s;aid purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To the third objection I cannot allow the &s;malle&s;t weight: <HI>Who, I would a&s;k, are the Idlers?</HI> Perhaps there is no mode of life which requires more a&s;&s;iduous and laborious application, than that of a <HI>good</HI> and <HI>con|&s;i&s;tent</HI> actor. School exerci&s;es are certainly not the mo&s;t <HI>plea&s;urable</HI> employments of adole&s;cence; and ev|ery adult can tell, how much more ea&s;ily he could imprint the memory of his early years, than that re|tention which is the accompaniment of his matured life. But the <HI>ambitious</HI> and <HI>principled</HI> actor hath pa&s;t the age of flexibility, and &s;till his days are, almo&s;t un|cea&s;ingly,

devoted to &s;tudy: By frequent repetitions, &s;uch is the con&s;titution of the mind, the fine&s;t &s;enti|ments too often pall; and the well informed, in|genious and meritorious performer is in danger of lo&s;ing his ta&s;te for the highe&s;t mental enjoyments; while the entertainment which he produces for oth|ers, is the re&s;ult of unremitted and painful labour to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Why then, permit me to a&s;k, if he is &s;olicitous to blend, with our amu&s;ements, the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible im|provement; if he profe&s;&s;edly pur&s;ues the means of living; if his manners and his morals are unblemi&s;hed; and if, by becoming &s;tationary, he in effect takes rank with our citizens&mdash;why, I a&s;k, is he <HI>&s;o lightly e&s;teemed?</HI> Surely, if, under the influence of rea&s;on, of gratitude and impartiality, I mu&s;t unhe&s;itatingly acknowledge, per&s;ons ardently engaged in procuring for us a <HI>ra|tional entertainment,</HI> are entitled to a <HI>degree of genuine re|&s;pect,</HI> to encouragement, and even to patronage.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted, and the a&s;&s;ertion does not appear un|founded, that a <HI>virtuous theatre</HI> is highly influential in regulating the opinions, manners, and morals of the populace.</P>
<P>Here we are naturally led to the fourth and la&s;t di|vi&s;ion of our &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Relaxation of morals.</HI>&mdash;And I a&s;k, Doth not a <HI>virtu|ous theatre</HI> exemplify the le&s;&s;ons which the ethic preacher labours to inculcate? I take it for granted, that none but a <HI>virtuous and well regulated theatre</HI> will be tolerated. In the &s;outhern and middle States, Philadelphia particularly, no performance can make its appearance upon the &s;tage, without pa&s;&s;ing under the previous examination of the governor and two other re&s;pectable magi&s;trates, who, by their avowed appro|bation, become re&s;pon&s;ible to the public for the merit of the piece. Similar re&s;trictions will, perhaps, be adopted, wherever the Drama &s;hall progre&s;s; and my confidence in the tru&s;tees of the Bo&s;ton theatre, repre|&s;ents to my view every apprehen&s;ion, not only as &s;uper|fluous, but ab&s;olutely injurious.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="034162_0227_0FFC65178B247A60">
Virtue then will be adorned with all her native love|line&s;s, and vice exhibited, deformed and mi&s;hapen, as that dete&s;ted hag, which Milton's energetic pen hath &s;o hideou&s;ly pourtrayed. Is there a bo&s;om that will not ha&s;ten to embrace the one? Is there a mind that will not &s;hrink with horror from the other? The man of firmne&s;s, of principle, and of worth innate; the mild, the con&s;i&s;tent, the regular, the maternal fair one; the&s;e &s;hall be rewarded with bur&s;ts of heart-felt applau&s;e; while the imbecile or irre&s;olute votary of error, the unprincipled betrayer, the fraudulent villain, the licen|tious, perver&s;e and abandoned female; the&s;e <HI>charac|ters</HI> &s;hall be &s;tigmatized with reproach, exhibited in their native atrocity, and &s;et up as beacons to deter our young people from pur&s;uing a path, which will render them odious to every per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;enti|ment and virtue.</P>
<P>Socrates, Cicero, and even Cato, have mingled with the audience in a theatre; and as it is pre&s;umed that the buffoonery of an Ari&s;tophanes will not be tolerated upon an American &s;tage, it is plea&s;ingly believed, that the dignity of years, of wi&s;dom, and of virtue, will, in no in&s;tance, be outraged by the children of the Drama.</P>
<P>The Pompeys of our day, it is to be hoped, will learn many a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on; they will commence &s;tu|dents in the &s;chool of the <HI>rights of man;</HI> and, becoming proficients in the laws of equity and of nature, like the Roman general, they will retire from the theatre, converts to the virtuous and impartial de&s;ignations of equality.</P>
<P>Religious wor&s;hip, it is &s;aid, gave birth to the Drama; and under proper regulations, it may &s;till conduce to acts of devotional piety. To Athens and to Rome, the theatre became a &s;ource of information, refined perception, and genuine morality; and we have only to avoid the cau&s;es which finally produced its de|generacy in the elder world, to continue it among us, in the&s;e States, an excellent exemplar and pre&s;ervative of rectitude. The theatre opens a wide field for litera|ry exertions; and we anticipate a rich harve&s;t of in|tellectual
<PB N="229" REF="034162_0228_0FFC65155DA1A9B0">
plea&s;ure and improvement. The &s;ons and daughters of fancy, the &s;entimentali&s;t, and the moral|i&s;t; the&s;e will engage in the intere&s;ting competition. They will con&s;ider that their productions are not in|tended barely for the amu&s;ement of a &s;olitary hour; that the Drama, pointing every excellence, will im|print upon the heart the &s;entiment of worth; that it may be in their power to fa&s;hion, and to lead, a <HI>na|tional ta&s;te;</HI> that by <HI>exalting virtue, and adorning reli|gion, rendering vice di&s;gu&s;ting, and &s;tigmatizing infidelity,</HI> they will mo&s;t effectually &s;econd the endeavours of that revered body, profe&s;&s;edly engaged to beautify mo|rality, and elevate religion.</P>
<P>We tru&s;t that a &s;pirit of <HI>laudable emulation</HI> will be excited; and while the &s;ummit of fame, in brighten|ing per&s;pective, uprears its wreath-crowned head, writers will be animated to the &s;plendid career, and with glowing ardour they will ha&s;ten forward to the de&s;ired goal. How delightful the employ! the mind, while engaged in painting the native charms of genu|ine and philanthropic religion, catching the fervour of divine in&s;piration, will nece&s;&s;arily become rectified and ameliorated by the delineation. Rectitude, a|dorned by her &s;i&s;ter graces, heaven-born contentment, con&s;equent felicity, and ever blooming joy&mdash;the&s;e will captivate every beholder. Economy, attired by her handmaid competence, with &s;erene tranquillity, pre&s;ent|ing to view the peace reflecting mirror, will not fail of reclaiming from the paths of profligacy the mo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated wanderer; and frugality and equity will remain prevalent in the mind. Nor will the exhibi|tion of vice be unattended with its &s;alutary effects. Conviction will be pointed to the bo&s;om of the aggre&s;|&s;or; the deformity of atrocious offences, &s;triking by illu&s;trating examples, will pre&s;ent the di&s;gu&s;ting figure, which the con&s;cious culprit will a&s;&s;uredly recognize, and the probability is, that abhorrence and reforma|tion will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Shake&s;peare, that penetrating ob&s;erver, &s;kilful in|ve&s;tigator, and indi&s;putable judge of the human heart,

makes his Hamlet &s;ay, "<HI>I've heard, that guilty creatures, at a play, have, by the very cunning of the &s;cene, been &s;truck &s;o to the &s;oul, that pre&s;ently they have proclaimed their male|factions. I'll have the&s;e players play &s;omething like the murder of my father, before my uncle.</HI>" And again; "<HI>The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the con&s;cience of the king.</HI>"</P>
<P>If it may be pre&s;umed, that the &s;tated objections, thus con&s;idered, are obviated, I conceive it will not be denied that, from a <HI>cha&s;te and di&s;creetly regulated</HI> thea|tre, many attendant advantages will indi&s;putably re|&s;ult. Young per&s;ons will acquire a refinement of ta&s;te and manners; they will learn to think, &s;peak, and act, with propriety; a thir&s;t for knowledge will be originated; and from attentions, at fir&s;t, perhaps, con&s;tituting only the amu&s;ement of the hour, they will gradually proceed to more important inquiries.</P>
<P>Clarinda Meanwell, the daughter of a gentleman whom I highly re&s;pect, who&s;e education hath been upon the very be&s;t plan, continued neverthele&s;s, for the fir&s;t twenty years of her life, without manife&s;ting the &s;malle&s;t literary curio&s;ity. It was impo&s;&s;ible to intere&s;t her, even in the pages of a novel; and what|ever &s;he learned, was more the re&s;ult of a di&s;po&s;ition naturally conceding, than of voluntary application. A company of itinerant players vi&s;ited her native vil|lage; the night of exhibition was announced, <HI>every body,</HI> as they phra&s;ed it, was going; but Mi&s;s Clarinda could not be animated to a wi&s;h for the entertainment; her accu&s;tomed complacency of di&s;po&s;ition yielded her, however, the companion of her a&s;&s;ociates; the piece was intere&s;ting; it forcibly &s;eized her faculties; it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, to <HI>her,</HI> in every &s;en&s;e, the charms of novelty; for the world &s;he would not be ab&s;ent upon any fu|ture occa&s;ion.

reach. Hi&s;tory, geography, a&s;tronomy&mdash;in all the&s;e, her proficiency is prodigious; and, in one word, I hardly know a better informed, or more amiable young woman in the circle of my acquaintance. But Cla|rinda Meanwell is not a &s;olitary in&s;tance; and as I have very frequently ob&s;erved the good effects of dra|matical repre&s;entations, I tru&s;t that my readers are enough acquainted with a heart, the feelings of which I have, upon various occa&s;ions, e&s;&s;ayed to &s;ketch, to give me full <HI>credit,</HI> for that throb of deep-felt compla|cency, which I experienced upon receiving informa|tion of the elegant and &s;uperb theatre, which hath &s;o recently been erected for the reception of the Drama, in the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>And here, gentle reader, I would with all my &s;oul gratify thee by a full and complete de&s;cription of this well built and beautifully decorated man&s;ion of the Mu&s;es&mdash;&s;uch as it appeared upon the fir&s;t drawing up of the curtain; but from the multiplicity of ideas which then crowded the mind, it is impo&s;&s;ible to pre|pare an accurate de&s;cription, and as I <HI>write for po&s;teri|ty,</HI> I would not willingly leave a &s;ingle pillar, capital, architrave, entablature, or cornice, unnoted: Fu|ture opportunies may pre&s;ent, and, if I am not fore|&s;talled, a future Gleaner may delineate the building. My brother Ru&s;&s;ell hath already informed thee, that "the hou&s;e was filled from the lowe&s;t note to the top of the compa&s;s;" and his ob&s;ervations upon the audi|ence may be recognized by truth. The long expected era arrived; it was indeed replete with expectation&mdash;the interpo&s;ing veil was thrown back, and that plea&s;|ing actor, who&s;e eulogy hath been &s;o frequently pro|nounced, made his entrance amid the mo&s;t unequivo|cal demon&s;trations of &s;atisfaction which a &s;en&s;ible, an|ticipating, and admiring a&s;&s;embly could exhibit. The effects of a reception, which mu&s;t have been every way adequate to his wi&s;hes, were plea&s;ingly evinced, by a &s;u&s;ceptibility honorary to the manly character; and the prologue then fir&s;t vibrated upon the public ear,
<PB N="232" REF="034162_0231_0FFC650B3AAF8770">
with every advantage, which that truly cla&s;&s;ical per|formance &s;o indi&s;putably merits.</P>
<P>That this prefatory addre&s;s is a genuine prologue, notwith&s;tanding every objection which hath been ad|vanced, I take leave to affirm. What can &s;o proper|ly be con&s;tituted the harbinger of a dramatic perform|ance, as a &s;uccinct account of that drama it is intend|ed to introduce? and what &s;o natural for a general dedication of a theatre, as a delineation of the prog|re&s;s of the art, to which it is con&s;ecrated? If variety, and richne&s;s of imagery, cla&s;&s;ical allu&s;ions, found mo|rality, nervous expre&s;&s;ions, beauty of diction, and much information, con&s;titute a fir&s;t rate poem, the prologue is certainly inve&s;ted with the faire&s;t preten&s;ions to the honorary palm. To point out all its beauties, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert the compo&s;ition entire; yet I cannot forbear repeating the following charm|ingly figurative lines:
<Q><L>Warm to the heart the chymic fiction &s;tole,</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, by moral alchymy, the &s;oul.</L></Q>
And again,
<Q><L>The globe's proud butcher grew humanely brave!</L>
<L>Earth &s;taunch'd her wounds, and ocean hu&s;h'd his wave.</L></Q></P>
<P>The allu&s;ion to the general deluge is &s;trikingly and inimitably beautiful. The poet was mo&s;t happy in this thought: I think I have not &s;een it &s;urpa&s;&s;ed; and I que&s;tion if the Shake&s;pearian panegyri&s;ts have ever yet done that immortal bard more ample ju&s;tice, than he hath received in the&s;e finely expre&s;&s;ed lines:
<Q><L>But hark! her mighty rival &s;weeps the &s;trings:</L>

&s;tinted pages of a Magazine, damped the mo&s;t fervid wi&s;hes of my &s;oul.

The Poet mu&s;t doubtle&s;s feel him&s;elf much exhilerated, as he contemplates the well earned <HI>guerdon</HI> of &s;uperior talents; yet I dare &s;ay that he will wear his honours with becoming meekne&s;s; and when it is remembered, that Sophocles, the illu&s;trious ornament and patron of the Grecian drama, ab&s;olutely <HI>died of joy,</HI> upon obtaining from his competitors the prize of merit, adjudged him for one of his tragedies, our youthful hard will be tolerated in a con&s;iderable expan&s;ion of plea&s;urable feelings.</P>
<P>The play was admirably cho&s;en; it is a <HI>time hon|oured piece;</HI> and it contains many &s;entiments, which can never reverberate upon the ear of &s;en&s;ibility with|out &s;peaking to the fine&s;t feelings of the &s;oul. In the very fir&s;t &s;cene, in the fir&s;t act, our attention is forci|bly arre&s;ted, and we cannot avoid taking the deepe&s;t intere&s;t in the di&s;gui&s;ed hero, although immured in the mines of Dalecarlia; and while "<HI>&s;tretch'd there, where reigns eternal night, the flint his pillow, and cold damps his coverings; yet we behold him bold of &s;pirit, and robu&s;t of limb, throwing inclemency a&s;ide, &s;uperior to the lot of human frailty.</HI>" With Ander&s;on, &s;pontaneou&s;ly, "<HI>we breathe the voice of virtue, of cordial amity, from man to man, and that benignity that whi&s;pers to the &s;oul, to &s;eek and cheer the &s;ufferer.</HI>"</P>
<P>The &s;entiments of Ander&s;on, of Arnoldus, and of Gu&s;tavus, are the very &s;oul of valour, benevolence, patrioti&s;m, and every &s;hining virtue. The &s;ub&s;equent di&s;covery, the entrance of Arvida&mdash;the tenderne&s;s, the amity of heroes is per&s;onified, and we experience an exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction, in yielding our applau&s;e to tho&s;e Dalecarlians, of whom Gu&s;tavus &s;ays, "<HI>I've &s;earch'd the&s;e men, and find them like the &s;oil, barren without, and to the eye unlovely; but they've their mines within them, and this the day I mean to prove them.</HI>"</P>

The character of Cri&s;tiern is a complete exemplifi|cation of whatever is dete&s;table in a tyrant: Perhaps no language can more conci&s;ely group the traits, which go to the compo&s;ition of the in&s;ufferable de&s;|pot, than the following: "<HI>Wretches! &s;hall I go por|ing on the earth, le&s;t my imperial foot &s;hould tread on emmets?</HI>"</P>
<P>The trial of Arvida is admirably conceived; it was an ordeal adequate to the warrior, the lover, and the friend.

"<HI>If thou ha&s;t aught to urge again&s;t Arvida, the man of virtue, tell it not the wind, le&s;t &s;lander catch the &s;ound, and guilt &s;hould triumph.</HI>" The interview be|tween the matchle&s;s friends, is uncommonly high wrought, and &s;upported too upon the be&s;t principles. Unlike our modern votaries of an <HI>illu&s;ion,</HI> which they <HI>bla&s;phemou&s;ly term honour,</HI> Gu&s;tavus, innately elevated, e&s;teems it no diminution of his glory, to develop a my&s;tery, which was on the point of precipitating his Arvida into irretrievable ruin. How doth the expla|nation dignify the hero, and how generou&s;ly pathetic is his defence of the beguiled chief: "<HI>Unhappy man! my heart bleeds for thee: fal&s;e I had &s;urely been, had I like thee been tempted.</HI>" But the &s;elf-reproach which had planted all its daggers in the bo&s;om of Arvida, pro|claims him the proper object of a hero's confidence, and we mo&s;t &s;incerely join i&s;&s;ue in his conclu&s;ion: "<HI>Pardon can expiate; it is the lethean &s;weet, the &s;now of heaven, new blanching o'er the black'ning front of guilt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">at, to the eye of mercy, all appears fair as the unwritten page.</HI>"</P>
<P>To the bo&s;om of filial piety, the apology of Chri&s;|tina is a nece&s;&s;ary and timely relief: "<HI>Had I to death or bondage &s;old my &s;ire, or had Gu&s;tavus on our native realms made ho&s;tile inroad! then, my Mariana! had I then &s;av'd him from the &s;troke of ju&s;tice, I &s;hould not cea&s;e my &s;uit for pardon.

lov'd, I might have &s;taid with honour.</HI>" This fini&s;hing of the character of Chri&s;tina, is unexpected, and, in my opinion, completes the beauty and &s;ymmetry of the performance.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to give language to the feelings of an attentive and &s;u&s;ceptible audience during the rep|re&s;entation of this ma&s;terly compo&s;ition. The fini&s;hed elegance of the building, the &s;urrounding lights, the brilliant a&s;&s;embly, &s;o &s;trikingly contra&s;ting the &s;tage &s;cene, where was exhibited the country of Dalecarlia, the tents in per&s;pective, the hardy veterans, arrayed in martial order, pa&s;&s;ing in review, &amp;c. &amp;c. all this, to|gether with the novelty of arrangements, &s;o far &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing what we had ever before witne&s;&s;ed, was, in truth, inexpre&s;&s;ibly captivating.</P>
<P>The di&s;tant country of the admired chief &s;eemed in reality extended to our view; and, for my&s;elf, I am free to own, that as I glanced my eye from the &s;tage, to the throng of re&s;pectable citizens, occupying the pit, boxes, and galleries; as I ob&s;erved the marked attention in the <HI>never deceptive eye,</HI> the &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s, the tender tear upon the cheek of beauty, and the hu|mid eye of manhood, with the alternate bur&s;ts of ap|plau&s;e, betokening <HI>congenial virtues</HI>&mdash;as I marked the&s;e effects, the agitation of my bo&s;om became well near ungovernable.</P>
<P>On the performers, perhaps, I ought not to hazard a remark. As an American, <HI>comparatively new</HI> to ob|&s;ervations of this nature, I cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed a com|petent judge; yet, &s;o complete was my &s;atisfaction, that I did not hear without pain, that many individu|als expre&s;&s;ed di&s;plea&s;ure; and I can only account for this by a &s;uppo&s;ition that there expectations were too high rai&s;ed to admit of gratification in the pre&s;ent in|fancy of our Drama.</P>
<P>Surely it ought to be remembered, that the plant, however luxuriant, doth not, immediately on being removed to a foreign &s;oil, continue its pri&s;tine vigour; and candor hath already ob&s;erved that the <HI>prohibited play then fir&s;t</HI> arre&s;ting the attention of the performers,
<PB N="239" REF="034162_0238_0FFC64FFAC9A2AC8">
could not, in &s;o early an exhibition, obtain, in the rep|re&s;entation, the perfection of which it is doubtle&s;s &s;u&s;|ceptible. Yet we think it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that Mr. Powell, in the character of Cri&s;tiern, in&s;pired all tho&s;e abhorrent feelings which the poet intended to originate; that Mr. Jones &s;upported with admirable kill the part of Trollio, and that the Swedi&s;h prie&s;t, by &s;o finely contra&s;ting the treachery and baleful tal|ents of the infamous bi&s;hop, pre&s;ented to the mind a mo&s;t agreeable relief. Such &s;hould always figure a herald of genuine religion.</P>
<P>Gratitude and faithfulne&s;s, in the character of Laer|tes, were per&s;ua&s;ively delineated by his repre&s;entative. Mr. S. Powell &s;eemed indeed Arvida; and Gu&s;tavus &s;hone upon us enriched with native &s;plendour.</P>
<P>In the female parts, the beauty and propriety of fil|ial piety, the captivating magic of the tender pa&s;|&s;ion, the dignity of the prince&s;s and the woman, were &s;trikingly exemplified by Mi&s;s Harri&s;on; her pronun|ciation was di&s;tinct, her empha&s;is generally proper, and her ge&s;tures naturally expre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>The Spartan virtues per&s;onified in Augu&s;ta, and en|twining all the tenderne&s;s of the maternal character, demanded the mo&s;t glowing, dignified, and deeply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> action. We conceive the fir&s;t theatrical abil|ities were <HI>requi&s;ite</HI> to the performing this part with propriety.</P>
<P>The young Gu&s;tava was truly intere&s;ting; nor was there a &s;ympathizing mother pre&s;ent, who&s;e bo&s;om did not throb to &s;natch from the envenomed talons of the fell de&s;troyer the &s;oul-affecting innocent. Mariana was not de&s;titute of merit; &s;he &s;eemed to de&s;erve the place &s;he occupied in the confidence of the royal virgin.</P>
<P>To the comic powers, exhibited upon that evening, ample ju&s;tice has been done. Unequivocal demon&s;tra|tions of applau&s;e re&s;ounded from every corner of the hou&s;e, and, for my part, I congratulate the &s;ons of Momus with all my heart; for, having never yet been
<PB N="240" REF="034162_0239_0FFC64FD7308ED18">
able to conceive the &s;malle&s;t evil in laughter, &s;imply con&s;idered, I cannot but give my vote in favour of <HI>cor|rected mirth.</HI> Mr. Collins, Mi&s;s Baker, &amp;c. &amp;c. the&s;e have all received the tributary laurel; and I do not feel in the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to enter my caveat upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Gleaner confe&s;&s;es that his expectations were more than an&s;wered; but the Gleaner hath never wit|ne&s;&s;ed the theatrical abilities of a Garrick, or a Sid|dons; nor is he certain he ought to regard this as a misfortune.</P>
<P>It is always invidious to point out faults; at lea&s;t it is to me an unplea&s;ing ta&s;k. From an infant &s;tage I look for improvement. The time will arrive when the performers will <HI>in no in&s;tance "O'er&s;tep the mode&s;ty of Nature.</HI>" Even tragedy may deal too much in &s;tarts: It &s;hould be energetic; it &s;hould be pathetic; but the pompous &s;well and &s;trut, make no part of its excellence. Ea&s;e and elegance are the naivette of com|edy, and its features are the features of poli&s;hed and corrected nature.</P>
<P>But I repeat, I look for improvement; gradually we &s;hall progre&s;s; the performers will think more of the audience, and they will, by con&s;equence, <HI>appear</HI> to <HI>think le&s;s;</HI> in other words, they will <HI>&s;eem</HI> to forget the circles that attend them. <HI>Their frequent appeals by eye and hand</HI> will in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ub&s;ide; and, through the whole of the repre&s;entation, they will &s;ee the propriety of addre&s;&s;ing the per&s;on, or per&s;ons, to whom they are <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> particularly to &s;peak. In one word&mdash;the au|dience will refine the players, and the players will re|fine the audience.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE often thought, that &s;erious and well di&s;|po&s;ed believers of the heathen mythology, mu&s;t have found them&s;elves wonderfully impelled to acts of devotional piety. It was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch per&s;ons to pur&s;ue their cour&s;e in any direction, which did not pre&s;ent to their external optics, or to the eye of their imagination, beings who were, <HI>in their e&s;timation,</HI> proper objects of adoration. A re&s;pectable writer de|&s;cribes the va&s;t univer&s;e as the &s;olemn temple of the pagans; and, we may add, that in every divi&s;ion of this &s;uperb fane, altars, &s;acred to their various rituals pre&s;ent. The empire of fancy is thronged by per&s;on|ified ideas; the pro&s;opopoeia is ea&s;y, and gods and godde&s;&s;es clu&s;ter in every walk. He&s;iod, in his gene|alogical hi&s;tory of the heathen deities, delineates thirty thou&s;and of the&s;e dignified beings, and an indulgent imagination readily inve&s;ts them with their peculiar properties and offices.</P>
<P>To the child of fancy, &s;heltered in the &s;eque&s;tered grove from the inten&s;e heat of &s;ummer, the &s;alutary breeze which gently agitates the leaves is the ro&s;y breath of the winged zephyrus, and the murmuring of that &s;tream, which winds its gla&s;&s;y cour&s;e, is the &s;oft &s;ighing of a river nymph, while, with equal ingenuity, amid the pelting &s;torm, he con&s;iders the hoar&s;e bellow|ing of the winds as the &s;onorous voice of &s;ome potent god.</P>
<P>Neptune gra&s;ps his trident, and holds dominion in the va&s;t world of waters. Pluto, borne in his &s;able chariot, bears the keys of ages and of dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">; while Jupiter, a&s;cending the &s;kies, mounts his throne of ivory, extending in his right hand the avenging thunder-bolt,
<PB N="242" REF="034162_0241_0FFC64F89287FCF0">
and in his left the &s;ceptre of &s;overeignty. To the&s;e &s;uc|ceed a train of &s;ubordinate immortals, all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their peculiar attributes, and occupying their various departments. Of the &s;ea&s;ons of the year, the fruits of the earth, and the different &s;tages of life, infancy, adole&s;cence, maturity, and old age, a pre&s;iding deity took charge. In the catalogue of divinities, every virtue found its patron and its patrone&s;s; nay, among this multifarious generation of immortals, even the reprehen&s;ible pa&s;&s;ions were not de&s;titute of their pro|tectors. The &s;incere votary of this mythology, I &s;ay, mu&s;t have been continually &s;timulated to acts which his directory a&s;&s;ured him were proper and nece&s;&s;ary; and, for my own part, I am free to own, that however fanciful <HI>rea&s;on</HI> may con&s;ider this fabulous hierarchy, I &s;ee no impropriety, in &s;till allowing it, in the works of imagination, a <HI>vi&s;ionary being;</HI> and poetry, certainly, even to the pre&s;ent era, gathers &s;ome of its mo&s;t orna|mental flowers from this magical, or legendary garden of antiquity.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the heathen gods and godde&s;&s;es is &s;o interwoven with the occurrences of ancient times, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to peru&s;e tho&s;e venerable pages with advantage, without a competent knowledge of their various characters and powers. I remember, when Margaretta was a child, I began a little biographical volume, which entitling a Theogeny, the better to captivate her attention, I threw into doggerel ver&s;e. My de&s;ign was, to give a &s;uccinct account of tho&s;e de|ities who had figured in hi&s;tory, and who &s;till hold their rank in &s;ome of our be&s;t poetical performances. An attention to bu&s;ine&s;s prevented my completing this <HI>bagatelle;</HI> but I am not &s;ure that I &s;hall not look it up, giving it a form, and the la&s;t poli&s;h, for the ben|efit of her children.</P>
<P>If we trace the traditionary fables which make up the bulk of the pagan &s;y&s;tem, we &s;hall generally find they originate in &s;ome momentous and incontroverti|ble truth; and however they may have been combined and adulterated, in the various channels through which
<PB N="243" REF="034162_0242_0FFC64F65EA77D08">
they have adventitiou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed, they &s;till retain &s;ome features, which, to the eye of ob&s;ervation, &s;ufficiently evince their augu&s;t parentage.</P>
<P>Through the labyrinth of error, the &s;criptuarian often follows a clew, which leads him directly to the fundamental principles of that <HI>revealed religion,</HI> which he reverences as of God, which he believes to be mo&s;t holy, and which he receives as the ground of his pre&s;|ent tranquillity, and his future hopes.</P>
<P>That chaos, which He&s;iod dignifies by the appella|tion of The Father of the Gods, Mo&s;es &s;imply calls <HI>The earth, without form and void.</HI> He&s;iod's relation is undoubtedly an allegorical account, wherein the vari|ous parts of nature are per&s;onified, of that hi&s;tory of the creation, which the Hebrew writer; in language na|tural and beautifully &s;ublime, &s;o inimitably narrated. Writers have appeared, who have &s;uppo&s;ed the fable of Prometheus to have taken ri&s;e in the character of Noah; others imagine they trace the features of the &s;econd founder of mankind in Deucalion. Plau&s;ible rea&s;ons are adduced for the&s;e conjectures; but perhaps we hazard le&s;s, in yielding credence to the re&s;pectable Boc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">art, who conceived this favourite of the Almigh|ty to have been wor&s;hipped, in &s;ucceeding times, by the name and attributes of Saturn. The golden age which is placed under the admini&s;tration of that deity; the tranquillity, friend&s;hip, and innocence, which is &s;aid to have reigned in the bo&s;om of every de&s;cription of mankind; the perpetual &s;pring which invariably flouri&s;hed; the temperate &s;erenity of the atmo&s;phere, neither veiled by gathering clouds, nor deformed by bur&s;ting &s;torms; the&s;e, and &s;imilar arrangements, un|doubtedly proclaim the interpo&s;ition of &s;ome philan|thropic prince, or benefactor of the race.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the Deucalion flood, if not a de&s;crip|tion, by another name, of the general deluge, bears, neverthele&s;s, &s;trong marks of affinity thereto. Lucian, giving &s;ome account of Syria, where it is &s;aid the del|uge of Deucalion originated, a&s;&s;ures us, <Q>That the Greeks a&s;&s;ert in their fables, that the fir&s;t men being

of an in&s;olent and cruel di&s;po&s;ition, inhuman, inho&s;|pitable, and regardle&s;s of their faith, were all de|&s;troyed by a deluge&mdash;the earth pouring forth va&s;t &s;treams of water</Q>&mdash;(in the Mo&s;aic language, the fountains of the great deep were broken up)&mdash;<Q>&s;well|ed the rivers, which, together with the rains, made the &s;ea ri&s;e above its banks and overflow the land, &s;o that all was laid under water: That Deucalion alone, &s;aved him&s;elf and family in the ark: That two of each kind of wild and tame animals, lo&s;ing their animo&s;ity, entered into it of their own accord: That this Deucalion floated upon the waters, until they became a&s;&s;uaged, and that he then repaired the human race.</Q> Writers al&s;o de&s;cribe the eminence which arre&s;ted the cour&s;e of this ve&s;&s;el; and by the authority of the celebrated biographer, Plutarch, we catch a glimp&s;e of the i&s;&s;uing dove which Abydenus denominates a certain fowl, that being twice let out of the ark, and finding no place of re&s;t, returned into the ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<P>The fable of Typhon, and the re&s;t of the giants, with the daring temerity of tho&s;e hideous mon&s;ters; their audacious in&s;ult upon the re&s;idence of the cele&s;|tials, and their levelling war with the gods; all the&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing circum&s;tances may find their origin in the Hebrew hi&s;torian, who de&s;cribes the earth as bearing a race of men of uncommon &s;tature, and complicated atrocity; who delineates the tower of Babel, and the defeat of that impious confederacy. The de&s;ign form|ed by Agamemnon, of immolating, upon the altar of idolatry, his unoffending daughter, may be nothing more than a vitiated tradition of that illu&s;trious period in the life of the patriarch Abraham, which exhibits him as preparing, at the command of the Almighty, to &s;acrifice as a burnt offering, that &s;on, then a beard|le&s;s youth, among who&s;e de&s;cendants he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to expect the Shiloh, to whom the gathering of the people &s;hould be. But however amu&s;ing the tracing this analogy may be, were I to pur&s;ue &s;o fruit|ful a &s;ubject, I &s;hould a&s;&s;uredly multiply words beyond the indulgence of my readers.</P>
<P>It is evident from &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory, that in the beginning, one only Omnipotent, Omnipre&s;ent, and Omni&s;cient Sovereign of the univer&s;e, was deem|ed a proper object of adoration; and this unknown Being was devoutly hailed as life, light, and wi&s;dom. All created beings were &s;uppo&s;ed to be beneficently di|rected by a &s;elf-exi&s;tent and eternal mind to the pre&s;er|vation, protection, and final felicity of the whole. This great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e, ere yet the imagination of men had clothed him in the habiliments of caprice, was addre&s;&s;ed under &s;everal appellations. Perhaps the <HI>ra|tional religioni&s;t</HI> of every age hath found no difficulty in adopting the language of Seneca&mdash;"By Jove," &s;ays that celebrated Roman, "the wi&s;e men among the an|cients, did not mean &s;uch a one as we &s;ee in the capitol,

It is not &s;trange that a lively and pious imagination, &s;hould gradually deify the attributes and favours of &s;o un&s;earchable, augu&s;t, and beneficent a being. Thus the family of the gods claim their origin; and, in proce&s;s of time, the depravity of mankind en|dowing them with ab&s;urd and reprehen&s;ible pa&s;&s;ions, rendered them in their de&s;criptions altogether like un|to them&s;elves. Re&s;pectable per&s;ons of both &s;exes were next pre&s;&s;ed into this &s;acred order, and thus the multi|farious catalogue was &s;welled to an enormous &s;ize. The joys, the &s;orrows, the apprehen&s;ions, and the ca|lamities of mankind, &s;upplied the materials from which the convenient deity was &s;haped; the apotheo&s;is was conferred, and divine honours were next in cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to inform thee, gentle reader, that I am no pagan. The heathen &s;y&s;tem is long &s;ince ex|ploded; and we have, by common con&s;ent, circum|&s;cribed their deities within <HI>comparatively</HI> narrow bounds; but yet it may be a que&s;tion, whether in ceding to them the empire of imagination, in leaving the domain of fancy open to their juri&s;diction, we have not a&s;&s;igned them circles which are &s;ufficiently ample. However, be this as it may, I am free to own, that while I trace in the Jupiter of antiquity many of the features of that Omnipotent, who pre&s;ideth over the informed mind of more refined ages, arguing from analogy, I am fond of conceiving, that not a few of their &s;ubor|dinate traditions originating in truth, may thus po&s;&s;e&s;s a right to claim their ance&s;try in the invi&s;ible world.</P>

A pla&s;tic and beneficent hand, fa&s;hioning and up|holding the great and various productions of nature, is momently evinced, both to &s;en&s;e and to rea&s;on.

<P>The doctrine of guardian &s;eraphs&mdash;this al&s;o makes a part of my creed. Some bright cele&s;tial was com|mi&s;&s;ioned at my birth, to pre&s;ide over my infantile years, and to continue the attendant of my mortal ca|reer. During the hour which &s;hall terminate my pre&s;|ent mode of being, he will be bu&s;y round the bed of death, and he will gratulate, with ineffable tran&s;port, the liberated &s;pirit. "<HI>Myriads of beings tread this globe un&s;een, both when we wake and when we &s;leep.</HI>" I per|&s;uade my&s;elf that truth guided the pen of the poet in this a&s;&s;ertion. The gro&s;s film of mortality veils for the pre&s;ent the vi&s;ual ray; yet there are, who have been &s;o favoured, even while &s;ojourning in terre&s;trial abodes, as to catch a glimp&s;e of tho&s;e natives of Ely&s;ium; and the period ha&s;tens when the wide expan&s;e &s;hall be out&s;pread before us. But be&s;ide tho&s;e beneficent &s;er|aphs who, with angelic vigils guard our path, the &s;hades of departed friends hover round; and, when worn by &s;ickne&s;s or by &s;orrow, the gradually attenuated machine admits, through apertures thus made, the dawning light of paradi&s;e. The&s;e tenderly intere&s;ted and &s;ym|pathizing denizens of the cele&s;tial world, not unfre|quently, with mildly &s;ympathizing a&s;pect, &s;tand con|fe&s;&s;ed to the patient &s;ufferer, pointing him, with the finger of affiance, to that opening heaven, upon which

he is &s;o apparently verging: And hence perhaps it is, that the period of di&s;&s;olution is &s;eldom to the expiring individual, marked with tho&s;e horrors, which in a &s;tate of health and vigour are commonly anticipated. Po&s;|&s;ibly the felicity of tho&s;e who have bid adieu to time, may not be completed until the final con&s;ummation, which &s;hall pre&s;ent the family of man entire. They may witne&s;s our actions; when our conduct is marked by regularity and propriety, we in&s;ure their approba|tion. When, deviating from the line of rectitude, we engage in reprehen&s;ible pur&s;uits, we incur the cen&s;ure of beatified &s;pirits, and they experience that kind of pain to which immortals of this de&s;cription may be &s;ubjected; the lu&s;tre of cele&s;tial vi&s;ages are dimmed; a tran&s;ient cloud ob&s;cures their brightening joys, and the pearly drop of regret &s;uffu&s;es the radiant eye of &s;eraphic plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>What a forcible incentive to a per&s;everance in the career of virtue, do con&s;iderations of this nature fur|ni&s;h! The eye of my mind is at this moment thrown upon an amiable and elegant woman, whom I have long known; her whole life hath exhibited a uniform exemplification of every &s;ocial, every humane, and ev|ery endearing excellence; her conjugal engagement hath been remarked, for &s;ome uncommonly &s;plendid traits, and the cha&s;te correctne&s;s of her manners have been regarded as the pattern of feminine demeanour. Her married life hath compri&s;ed a period of forty years. She has never been a mother, and yet perhaps the an|nals of her &s;ex cannot produce a more perfect model of the maternal character. No le&s;s than twenty or|phan girls, at different periods of time, with great care, a&s;&s;iduity and tenderne&s;s &s;he hath genteelly edu|cated. By her a&s;&s;i&s;tance and patronage, they are com|fortably e&s;tabli&s;hed, and they look up to her, as the revered &s;ource of their every enjoyment.</P>
<P>She is even now, in the pre&s;ent advanced &s;tage of her life, &s;urrounded by a virgin train, who pay her honours, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed only by tho&s;e which they devote to heaven. She hath her &s;tated days of fe&s;tivity, the

return of which are very frequent, when &s;he &s;ummon|eth her children, as &s;he calls them&mdash;all tho&s;e who have taken rank in families of their own, to join with her in tender and grateful commemorations. No &s;ove|reign, attended by the dependants upon his bounty, ev|er looked round with half the exultation, which, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, glows in, and elevates her bo&s;om. The figure is not good&mdash;&s;he is not a &s;overeign, &s;he is a ten|der parent, regarded with the cheerful eye of duteous affection, by the little community which her own hand hath formed to virtue and to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was on one of tho&s;e convivial days, that, induced by curio&s;ity, I lately looked in upon her. She was &s;eated in the mid&s;t of the plea&s;ed and plea&s;ing a&s;&s;em|bly. Methought I had never &s;een an object more in|tere&s;tingly beautiful: <HI>Yes, beautiful,</HI> for the <HI>wrinkles</HI> of her face po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more charms, than adorn the red and white of the poli&s;hed &s;kin of that giddy flutterer, whom all the energy of &s;entiment could never rai&s;e to the en|nobling &s;well of elevated thought or exemplary action. Dignity was impre&s;&s;ed upon her every feature, and it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could fail of in&s;piring the venerat|ing glow of admiration. I was coxcomb enough to pay her a flouri&s;hing compliment, which I concluded with pronouncing deci&s;ively&mdash;The reward of your be|nevolence, undoubtedly, Madam, will be very great.</P>
<P>Echoing my la&s;t words with inimitable grace, &s;he replied, "<HI>Will be very great?</HI> Tru&s;t me, dear Sir, I have <HI>no arrearages to demand.</HI> If, as you &s;ay, I have obtained the approbation of the good, that approbation is of it&s;elf a rich reward; and, Mr. Vigillius," placing her hand upon her brea&s;t, "<HI>I have peace at home;</HI> the plaudit of my own bo&s;om is indeed of countle&s;s worth; be&s;ides which, the duteous complacency at this mo|ment imprinted upon the countenances of the&s;e dear girls, is in truth a great and immea&s;urable reward; every decent ge&s;ture, every proper action, every grate|ful expre&s;&s;ion, have &s;till continued to me, through a cour&s;e of many years, a ready &s;ource, from which I have momently derived a cea&s;ele&s;s and abundant rec|ompen&s;e.

And, Sir, if you will indulge me &s;o far, I will confe&s;s a &s;entiment which hath, through life, very forcibly operated upon my mind. I have ever &s;uppo&s;|ed my&s;elf con&s;tantly under the in&s;pection of numerous, although viewle&s;s, witne&s;&s;es of my actions. The&s;e en|circling &s;pectators I have regarded as beings of the an|gelic order, a&s;&s;ociating with tho&s;e &s;pirits who were once clothed in mortality; and the approbating &s;mile of cele&s;tial joy, which I have con&s;idered as illuming the &s;eraphic countenances of the progenitors of the&s;e my adopted children, while they have &s;een me bu&s;ied about their offspring, engaged in eradicating the evil, pru|ning the luxuriant growth of &s;entiments, equitable in their &s;ource, and in directing and cheri&s;hing the prin|ciples of rectitude. Such ob&s;ervance, and &s;uch com|placent applau&s;e hath frequently given energy to my efforts, placed me buoyant upon the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of that invention, which is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to allure to virtue the &s;teps of youth, and abundantly &s;trength|ened, encouraged, and confirmed me in tho&s;e walks, which lead, as I conceive, to the paradi&s;e of the good. And, Sir, you will give me leave to add, that ideas of this kind obtaining in my mind, operate at once as an incitement to regularity of conduct, and con&s;tituteth a fund, from which I can freely draw the large&s;t com|pen&s;ation."</P>

<P>By the &s;elf poized hero, and the wor&s;hipper of chance, the Gleaner, henceforward, may be accounted a <HI>ridiculous vi&s;ionary:</HI> But he is per&s;uaded that the Chri&s;tian religioni&s;t will enli&s;t upon his &s;ide&mdash;for in the oracles of his God, the &s;cripturian will find, that the Author and Fini&s;her of his faith, hath &s;anctioned the idea of guardian &s;pirits, where he pronounces that the <HI>angels of the &s;ojourners in mortality, do always be|hold the face of Omnipotence.</HI></P>
<P>The immediate di&s;ciples of the Redeemer &s;poke <HI>confidently of the angel of Peter:</HI> And the apo&s;tle to the Hebrews characterizes the angels, <HI>as &s;pirits, mini&s;tring unto the heirs of &s;alvation.</HI> Upon our knowledge of de|cea&s;ed per&s;ons, the &s;cene di&s;played upon the mount of transfiguration, decides: For Peter &s;aid&mdash;Lord, if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for Mo&s;es, one for Elias, and one for thee.

<P>The Gleaner perceives, while embracing this per|&s;ua&s;ion, viz. the doctrine of angels and of &s;pirits, that a mo&s;t plea&s;ing tranquillity pervades his mind; and he cannot willingly relinqui&s;h it, except, in ex|change for &s;entiments, that he can conceive more di|vinely con&s;olatory, or more morally influential.</P>

<P>THAT melancholy pau&s;e, and <HI>extreme</HI> dejection, which at this pre&s;ent &s;o apparently pervades every order of citizens among us, is, methinks, rather derogatory to the American character.

<P>That our country hath, during a mo&s;t au&s;picious period, been borne forward upon the full tide of pro&s;|perity, no one but the embittered, the cynical, or the intere&s;ted incendiary, will deny.

Our manufactures have &s;urpri&s;ingly advanced.

<P>But deliberation here maketh a pau&s;e&mdash;Again&s;t whom &s;hall we commence ho&s;tilities?

<P>I SAID that genuine liberty recognized her &s;y&s;tems, her laws, and her regular chain of &s;ubordination; to all of which &s;he exacted the mo&s;t &s;crupulous obedi|ence; and, if this were not true, I confe&s;s that I, for one, &s;hould be inclined to deprecate her domination.

of the &s;ea. The elephant and the tatou, the o&s;trich and the humming bird, re&s;pire in our world, while naturali&s;ts are at a lo&s;s even to name the numer|ous grades, which make up and complete the &s;hades between the&s;e extremes. A various growth of flow|ers plea&s;e the eye; vegetables &s;u&s;tain and nouri&s;h; fruits regale the palate; and poi&s;onous plants, obtain|ing a luxuriant growth, rear their baleful heads. To trace the varieties of nature, is indeed a fruitful avo|cation; the region of fancy is &s;tocked with reflec|tions, while, to the curious ob&s;erver, engaged in the pur|&s;uit, hardly an hour revolves, which produces not an acce&s;&s;ion of ideas.</P>
<P>Light and &s;hade are productive of the fine&s;t effects; the eye is offended by a continuity of the &s;ame objects; hills and vallies, &s;ucceeding each other, furni&s;h the mo&s;t enchanting views; the interjacent plain is plea&s;|ingly terminated, by the &s;eque&s;tered grove; the glade beautifully diver&s;ifies the fore&s;t; and yonder tall ma|je&s;tic eminence is gracefully &s;kirted by the enamelled meadow which is out&s;pread beneath. The &s;ea&s;ons &s;ucceed each other, and the revolutions of day and night, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing their peculiar charms, are &s;alutary and grateful. Nor is this multiformity ob&s;ervable only in the le&s;s no|bler parts of the creation: The human being has va|rieties, which may almo&s;t be pronounced endle&s;s. The degrees of intellect, if we may judge by effects, are ve|ry unequally proportioned. Now a luminous genius darts through the complicated arrangements of nature; its pervading ken is &s;ubtil and energetic; its powers are adequate to re&s;earches the mo&s;t profound; it in|ve&s;tigates, and ob&s;curity is no more; the arcana of ages, yielding to its animated and elucidating progre&s;s, relinqui&s;heth the impenetrable veil; its ver&s;atility, and the depth of its ob&s;ervations are a&s;toni&s;hing; and, amid the blaze of refulgent day, it lifts its a&s;piring head.

her to the following effect:&mdash;Madam, influenc|ed by your good &s;en&s;e, and the irrefragable &s;trength of your arguments, you at this moment behold before you, the pro&s;elyte of your opinions. I am at length confident, that the children of men are all upon an equal footing; and, Madam, to give you proof po&s;i|tive that I am indeed a convert, here is a very &s;en&s;ible, civil, worthy, well-behaved citizen, your footman; I make it my reque&s;t that he may be permitted to &s;it down and dine with us. Doctor John&s;on, upon this, or &s;ome &s;imilar occa&s;ion, made a remark, which, agree|ably to the general tenor of his ob&s;ervations, carrieth its evidence along with it, and which the experience of every day may &s;erve to corroborate. "Your <HI>levellers,"</HI> &s;aid the Doctor, "wi&s;h to <HI>level down</HI> as far as them|&s;elves, but they cannot bear levelling <HI>up</HI> to them&s;elves; they would all have &s;ome people under them; why not then have <HI>&s;ome people</HI> above them?

William &s;ides with me, and we prepare for a trial of &s;trength; equally divid|ed, our oppo&s;ition bars our purpo&s;e; from words we proceed to blows; the females are alarmed; they take their &s;ides; the plot thickens; appearances grow for|midable; a doughty battle en&s;ues; bloody no&s;es are the con&s;equence; and the day is &s;acrificed to di&s;cord. Every morning is thus u&s;hered in; every portion of time is marked by oppo&s;ition. Now the land &s;hall be hedged with bu&s;hes, anon the ready rock &s;hall pre&s;ent the barrier, and again the wooden enclo&s;ure is all the rage. To day we will plough, to-morrow we will &s;ow. Nay, you are too early, you are too late; this is &s;uf|ficient, that is not enough; we will go hither and thither, every where, and no where.</P>
<P>Thus roll on the days, weeks and months. Au|tumn is at the door, the lands are uncultivated, and famine, with its meagre &s;tride, is rapidly advancing to our borders. Meanwhile, even in this tumultuous era, my hou&s;e, my e&s;tate confe&s;&s;eth a potentate. An|archy reigneth &s;upreme, and de&s;olation admini&s;tereth her commands.

which every &s;ober &s;entiment mu&s;t deprecate, becomes impo&s;&s;ible; no member of the family hath authority to interpo&s;e the dictatorial document, and the commands of the fiend are perforce obeyed. Who &s;hall prevent the &s;preading evil? If licentiou&s;ne&s;s is &s;ucce&s;sful in her impo&s;ture; if, a&s;&s;uming the ma&s;k of liberty, &s;he completeth her deception; if we pro&s;trate before this baleful de&s;troyer, where, I demand, is my &s;afety? What &s;ecurity can I have, that my neighbour, who&s;e &s;inewy arm can bear away the prize of &s;trength, will not &s;natch from me that patrimony, which, de|&s;cending from a virtuous line of ance&s;tors, I have pre|&s;erved, at the expen&s;e of laborious days, and many a &s;elf-denying conflict?

<P>But if the <HI>theory</HI> of equality is not <HI>practicable</HI> in the contracted circle of dome&s;tic life, much le&s;s will that experiment &s;ucceed which would realize it, in regard to the heterogeneous collection of beings who con&s;ti|tute a nation. Doth not Liberty a&s;&s;ociate her laws, her regulations, and her di&s;tinctions? Is not good gov|ernment the ba&s;is on which &s;he erecteth the &s;uper&s;truc|ture of all tho&s;e operations &s;o beneficial to mankind? Yes, Liberty, &s;acred and genuine Liberty, draweth with preci&s;ion the line, nor will &s;he permit a litigation of the inherent Rights of Man. She alloweth no im|aginary claims; &s;he is fearful of di&s;turbing the regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of order; &s;he is fond of the nece&s;&s;ary ar|rangement of civil &s;ubordination; and &s;he dreadeth that tumultuous and up-rooting hurricane, which, in|mingling the various cla&s;&s;es of mankind, de&s;troyeth the beautiful gradation and &s;eries of harmony, again re&s;toring all that wild uproar, re&s;ulting from the rude and mi&s;hapen domination of chaos. Yes, we repeat it, that people, that nation, that tribe or family, which is de&s;titute of legi&s;lation, regulation, and officers of government, mu&s;t unque&s;tionably be in a deplorable &s;ituation.

<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e a people in a &s;tate of nature, and let us &s;uppo&s;e them made up of all tho&s;e varieties of con|&s;titution, intellect, pa&s;&s;ions, and corporeal &s;trength, which are commonly found in a community. Expe|rience hath convinced them, that anarchy is pregnant with every evil; and they finally combine to form the league of government. What is the mode for the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, which we would recommend to &s;uch a people?

Fancy, for a moment, inve&s;ts me with the venerable and honorary character of a legi&s;lator; and, for the purpo&s;e of forming, for a &s;et of well di&s;po&s;ed men, a code of regulations, I imagine my&s;elf &s;eated, with the pen of inquiry in my fingers, and my de&s;ign being to compile a government of <HI>laws,</HI> rather than of <HI>individuals,</HI> I am naturally &s;olicitous to promulgate in&s;titutions, which &s;hall be at once &s;alutary, efficacious and plea&s;ing.

writers? Doubtle&s;s we &s;hould find our&s;elves in|volved in a labyrinth of oppo&s;ite te&s;timonies; and, confu&s;ed by a multiplicity of contradictory and per|haps fallacious opinions, reflection would be ab&s;orbed, and deci&s;ion at a &s;tand.</P>
<P>The ancients have remarked, that, cultivated by the hand of liberty in the dwellings of freedom, the arts and &s;ciences flouri&s;hed with invigorated charms; that neither the Per&s;ians or Egyptians under&s;tood their beauties; that from the Greeks, although too often engaged in ho&s;tilities, and &s;truggling in the toils of poverty, they obtained maturation; that they declined with that freedom, once the glory of the Grecian re|publics, and that, with their augu&s;t patrone&s;s, winging their etherial way to celebrious Rome, they there con|tinued their &s;plendid career, until the immolation of liberty, in that imperial city, muffled in dark and por|tentous clouds tho&s;e intellectual luminaries; and hence, from the&s;e incontrovertible facts, it is confi|dently a&s;&s;erted, that the arts and &s;ciences can never flouri&s;h but in the &s;oil of freedom. Yet, in oppo&s;ition to a conclu&s;ion which may have been too ha&s;til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> formed, we are told, that <HI>modern Rome</HI> and Florence have enwreathed with perfection, &s;culpture, painting, mu&s;ic and poetry; and that Florence, after the u&s;urp|ations of the family of Medici, made the mo&s;t rapid proficiency in tho&s;e arts. Ario&s;to, Ta&s;&s;o, Galileo, Raphael, and Michael Angelio; the&s;e illu&s;trious paint|ers, poets and mathematicians, it is ob&s;erved, were not born in republics. Reubens, it is &s;aid, collected and e&s;tabli&s;hed his &s;chool at Antwerp, and not at Am&s;ter|dam; and in Germany, the true poli&s;h of manners is rather to be found at Dre&s;den than at Hamburgh.</P>
<P>France hath undoubtedly furni&s;hed a &s;triking exam|ple of the pro&s;perity of literature in an ab&s;olute gov|ernment. Philo&s;ophy, poetry, dramatic eminence, oratory, hi&s;tory, painting, architecture, &s;culpture, mu|&s;ic&mdash;the&s;e have received the mo&s;t exten&s;ive cultivation, and the highe&s;t honours in the <HI>kingdom</HI> of France: And we are moreover a&s;&s;ured, that the <HI>cidevant</HI> &s;ubjects
<PB N="269" REF="034162_0268_0FFC64B355E813F8">
had a&s;toni&s;hingly meliorated that mo&s;t grateful and beneficial of all arts, <HI>l' Art de Vivre,</HI> the nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ocial art, which involves a mutual interchange of &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>contradictory</HI> are tho&s;e &s;treams of information, which yet may have originated in the fountain of wi&s;|dom. The &s;uper&s;tructures of governments have gen|erally been rai&s;ed upon apprehen&s;ion and compul&s;ion; in &s;uch circum&s;tances, error hath been almo&s;t unavoid|able, and it can never be matter of wonder, that hu|man &s;y&s;tems are &s;u&s;ceptible of improvement.</P>
<P>In the novelties of Lycurgus, the features of artifice and fraud are but too prevalent. Solon, although the votary of wi&s;dom, and undoubtedly the mild and be|neficent friend of mankind, yet even Solon entertained de&s;potic ideas of the powers ve&s;ted in him, and we can|not forbear ob&s;erving, that he con&s;idered him&s;elf as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an <HI>optional</HI> authority, to implant the germe of de&s;poti&s;m, or to emit the rays of bland and correct|ed freedom. Numa, by virtue of the godde&s;s Egeria, might have originated the gro&s;&s;e&s;t impo&s;itions; and it is an indubitable truth, that the rights of man are irreconcileable with a relinqui&s;hment of that privilege of inquiry, which may erect a barrier to the inunda|tion of evil. Turning, for a moment, from all tho&s;e re&s;ervoirs of knowledge, which, neverthele&s;s, I mu&s;t ever uncea&s;ingly venerate, I wave the occupation of a Gleaner, and &s;imply lighting the torch of rea&s;on at the flame of experience, I will, for the organization of my &s;ketch of immunities, con&s;ult tho&s;e &s;entiments and conclu&s;ions, which are the natural growth of a plain mind.</P>
<P>Common &s;en&s;e pronounces, that a people de&s;titute of a leader, and de&s;titute of legi&s;lation, loudly demand the <HI>protecting hand of a guardian power;</HI> and, liberty adds, that a chief &s;hould be obtained by the joint &s;uf|frages of the people at large. To this end, they mu&s;t be convened in their &s;everal di&s;tricts, where, uninflu|enced by party or by pa&s;&s;ion, let them commi&s;&s;ion him, whom they e&s;teem mo&s;t worthy, to a&s;&s;ume that augu&s;t

Let this their cho&s;en patriot be aided by a general council, con&s;i&s;ting of delegates according to the number of the people. Let the&s;e delegates be appointed by a deci&s;ion, influ|enced only by the intrin&s;ic worth of the candidates. Let them form two di&s;tinct deliberative bodies, or hou&s;es, properly qualified and authorized to ACT AS CHECKS upon each other; and, let the&s;e three branches be inve&s;ted with powers, fully adequate to all the pur|po&s;es of legi&s;lation. To the <HI>departments</HI> thus appoint|ed to the&s;e <HI>high offices</HI> of tru&s;t, let the utmo&s;t veneration be annexed; but I would ordain, that the individuals who filled them, &s;hould, after a &s;tated time, be remov|able at the plea&s;ure of the people. Even the Fir&s;t Magi&s;trate &s;hould hold his place but in con&s;equence of frequent re-elections; and for high crimes and mi&s;de|meanors, he &s;hould be con&s;idered as amenable to the laws. Upon legi&s;lative acts he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s only a conditional negative; and while his fellow-citizens were aided by his coun&s;els, they &s;hould be &s;ecured from his encroachments. He &s;hould always be con&s;idered as the Chief Warrior of the people; but in the forma|tion of treaties, he &s;hould call in, at lea&s;t, one branch of the legi&s;lature, and the &s;ame concurrence &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to the appointment to offices. The com|merce or currency of the nation &s;hould not be &s;ub|jected to the pre&s;criptions of its Executive, nor &s;hould he arrogate, in matters of con&s;cience, even the &s;hadow of juri&s;diction. As a faithful and vigilant friend of the people, he &s;hould be unwearied in his informations, recommendations, and all &s;uch con&s;titutional mea&s;ures, as he &s;hould conceive would conduce to the public weal; and, during his admini&s;tration, he &s;hould be careful to exact a faithful obedience to the laws.

<P>The judicial power &s;hould be &s;eparate from the ex|ecutive, and I would inve&s;t it with as large a &s;hare of <HI>independence</HI> as could con&s;i&s;t with <HI>reciprocality</HI> and <HI>union;</HI> while the degree of guilt involved in crimes of almo&s;t every de&s;cription, &s;hould be determined by the empan|nelled peers of the culprit.

that per&s;ons of this de&s;cription have, from time to time, been con&s;trained to take an intere&s;t in the fate of Margaretta Melworth Hamilton. I &s;ay, <HI>good-natur|ed reader,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>the Gleaner</HI> hath never yet had the arrogance to conceive his powers &s;ufficiently energet|ic to arre&s;t the attention of the phlegmatic, the &s;atur|nine, or the fa&s;tidious. Individuals po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing minds ca&s;t in the&s;e moulds, he hath con&s;idered as inacce&s;&s;ible, and he hath imagined them turning from the pages of the Gleaner, with all the frigidity of apathy, with all the glooms attendant upon rigorous &s;everity, di&s;gu&s;t, or contempt. Nor doth he enter this remark as a complaint; he hath been <HI>humble enough</HI> to content him|&s;elf with the e&s;teem of the <HI>candid</HI> and <HI>&s;incere;</HI> in the bo&s;om of &s;en&s;ibility he fondly conceives he hath ob|tained a place, and he is ambitious of rendering his efforts worthy that degree of con&s;ideration with which they may be regarded. Addre&s;&s;ing then the humane, the benevolent, and the ingenuous; in one word, tho&s;e who are willing to be plea&s;ed, he hardly he&s;itates in promi&s;ing him&s;elf at lea&s;t a hearing: and, he is free to own, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch a comfortable &s;hare of &s;elf complacency, as to become confident, that when|ever he con&s;ecrates his efforts by the name of the daughter of his affection, he en&s;ures a &s;hare of ap|probation; nor will he con&s;ent that this idea &s;hould be imputed altogether to an over-weening conceit of his own abilities; for &s;urely it mu&s;t be acknowledged that an amiable and meritorious woman, &s;truggling with misfortunes, is an object which virtue mu&s;t ever regard with commi&s;eration and applau&s;e. For the officious length of this exordium, I &s;upplicate the indulgence of tho&s;e gentle &s;pirits, upon who&s;e favour I have pre&s;um|ed; a candidate for the patronage of benignity &s;hould ha&s;ten to gratify the feelings of &s;u&s;ceptibility, and af|ter narrating a few previous arrangements, without further delay, I &s;hall pa&s;s on to a developement, which hath not only inve&s;ted our daughter with high afflu|ence, but hath, moreover, re&s;tored to her a ble&s;&s;ing, which &s;he entertained not the &s;malle&s;t conception of ever being permitted to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>

My la&s;t communications relative to Mrs. Hamilton, crowned her with tho&s;e honours which bloom mo&s;t becomingly upon a female brow; the propriety of her conduct in the matrimonial career could not be que&s;|tioned, and her patient merit was, in her own opinion, amply rewarded, by a di&s;covery that neither misfor|tunes or caprice had robbed her of, or in the &s;malle&s;t degree abated the affectionate attachment of him, to whom her gentle heart was unre&s;ervedly devoted.</P>
<P>That tumultuous delirium of joy, of which the &s;ketch of the &s;cene in my reading parlour, in the month of November la&s;t, can have given but an in|competent idea, gradually &s;ub&s;ided into an exqui&s;itely plea&s;ing calm. Peace, with every accompaniment, which ever clu&s;ters in the train of tranquillity, was re|in&s;tated in her bo&s;om; ro&s;y confidence, fruitful in the &s;oil of conjugal complacency, again lifted its au&s;pi|cious head, and the rich perfumes which it breathed around, &s;cattered tho&s;e &s;alutary &s;weets that gave to every object a face of plea&s;ure. Margaretta &s;eemed to regard poverty as the angel of &s;erenity: Indeed a true knowledge of her circum&s;tances had relieved her from a mighty pre&s;&s;ure, which, becoming quite in&s;upporta|ble, had well near broken the &s;lender thread of her ex|i&s;tence; and an a&s;&s;ured knowledge that &s;he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed tho&s;e undivided regards, which &s;he had &s;trong rea|&s;on to believe no longer reciprocated, very naturally, for a time, ab&s;orbed in her gentle bo&s;om every other con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Some days delightfully &s;erene, thus rolled on. I knew that the bur&s;ting &s;torm, the tremendous and up|rooting hurricane mu&s;t &s;ucceed; but I trembled to di&s;turb the innocent and unreflecting felicity of the moment. Mr. Seymour, the generous young man who had extricated Hamilton from his difficulties, while hopele&s;s love produced him a wandering fugi|tive in the &s;outhern States, had failed for &s;ome thou|&s;ands; and although repeated letters, glowing with friend&s;hip and matchle&s;s genero&s;ity, penned by the hand of Mr. Seymour, a&s;&s;ured us, that he would ward
<PB N="275" REF="034162_0274_0FFC64A3F92F0DA8">
the blow from us, to the extreme&s;t verge of po&s;&s;ibility; yet as he continued, for the &s;afety of his per&s;on, a pri&s;|oner in his own hou&s;e; as all his books, bonds, and papers, of every kind, were &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pec|tion of his creditors; and, as he a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf that a fair adju&s;tment, producing an amicable compromi&s;e, would u&s;her in his liberating hour, the utmo&s;t creduli|ty could not flatter us with continued exemption. Mr. Hamilton too, had many other creditors, and they be|came much more &s;u&s;picious, inqui&s;itive, and trouble|&s;ome, than we had expected.</P>
<P>The &s;cene once opened, my knowledge of mankind induced me to fear a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing events; and nece&s;&s;ity, therefore, impelled me to obtrude upon the halcyon hours of my children con&s;iderations which threw open the avenues of uncounted cares, and great inquietude. Serafina Clifford continued un|wearied in her remon&s;trances; &s;he was eager to di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;s her&s;elf, in favour of her brother, of every &s;hilling which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and again&s;t the ardour and gen|erous impetuo&s;ity of her attack, honour, ju&s;tice, and fraternal affection, although embodied for the purpo&s;e, maintained but a doubtful combat; until availing my|&s;elf of the rights inve&s;ted in me by my paternal author|ity, I was reduced to the di&s;agreeable alternative of interpo&s;ing a po&s;itive prohibition.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Clifford, in a kind of frenzy, cla&s;ped the little William to her bo&s;om, and calling upon the &s;hade of her departed father to witne&s;s her engagements, &s;he vowed henceforward to devote her&s;elf and fortune entirely to him; adding, <Q>I will, my lovely child, be indefatigable in guarding the &s;oil of thy infant mind from the admi&s;&s;ion of that fatal germ, which never fails to produce a growth of fal&s;e principles, of prin|ciples that pro&s;titute the &s;acred names of honour and integrity, be&s;towing them upon an <HI>un&s;ocial kind of pride,</HI> a barbarous &s;entiment, which compels its ad|herents, although placed upon a precipice of inter|minable ruin, to di&s;dain the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that friend|&s;hip which is warm, natural, glowing, and &s;incere;
<PB N="276" REF="034162_0275_0FFC649FC62BF8A8">
of that friend&s;hip, which, as it originates affinity and gratitude, as it is the re&s;ult of the fonde&s;t attachment, and meliorated by deliberate e&s;teem, can &s;urely nev|er be regarded as problematical. Sweet innocent! may the kindred blood that &s;wells thy little veins, render thee one day le&s;s obdurate than thy dear in|flexible parents. From this moment the intere&s;ts of Serafina and thine are in&s;eparably interwoven.</Q></P>
<P>Fear not, gentle reader, by virtue of the patriarchal dignity which I have a&s;&s;umed, I will, <HI>upon a proper oc|ca&s;ion,</HI> grant unto the &s;aid Serafina Clifford, a full and free ab&s;olution from this her incon&s;iderate vow, which I &s;hall take care to impute to the irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e of an impa&s;&s;ioned moment.</P>
<P>In concert with Mr. Hamilton, without delay I took mea&s;ures to place the property in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, beyond the reach of <HI>any &s;ingle</HI> creditor; regulating it in &s;uch a manner, as would inconte&s;tibly be mo&s;t for the advantage of, and yield unto <HI>every claimant an equal</HI> and hand&s;ome dividend. Thus prepared for a contingency that we had but too much rea&s;on mo|mently to expect, I reque&s;ted Mary once more to call into action that admirable addre&s;s which &s;he had &s;o repeatedly exemplified. Go, my love, &s;aid I, with all thy winning graces, and affectionate per&s;ua&s;ion; with all thy angel &s;oftne&s;s, and reconcile our daughter to that revolution in her pro&s;pects, which mu&s;t place her again a re&s;ident in this family. Margaretta was far advanced in her &s;econd pregnancy, and we judged it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, in regard to her, the utmo&s;t del|icacy; but we had not yet learned properly to appre|ciate the mind of our amiable child. Tho&s;e particu|lars, which are generally &s;o alluring to a young woman, were not con&s;idered by her, of &s;ufficient importance to give her e&s;&s;ential or la&s;ting pain. An e&s;tabli&s;hment, ranking as the head of a family, pre&s;iding at her ta|ble, giving laws to a train of &s;ervants, receiving vi&s;its in her own hou&s;e, with a number of <HI>et-ceteras,</HI> which have frequently the power of fa&s;cinating a young mind, were regarded as con&s;iderations <HI>comparatively</HI> of little
<PB N="277" REF="034162_0276_0FFC649E42F04220">
or no moment; and while con&s;cious &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the affections of the man of her heart; while &s;he retained his &s;ociety; while &s;he could cla&s;p to her throbbing bo|&s;om her lovely infant; while indulged with the pre&s;|ence of Mi&s;s Clifford, now more than ever endeared to her, and bound to her &s;oul by motives of the mo&s;t del|icate and indi&s;&s;oluble tenderne&s;s and e&s;teem; while &s;he enjoyed the approbating countenance of her parents, her &s;uperior under&s;tanding could &s;carce forbear a &s;mile at the &s;olicitude we di&s;covered re&s;pecting her removal; and, relinqui&s;hing her elegant apartments, I verily be|lieve without a &s;ingle murmur, &s;he ha&s;tened, together with her amiable friend, to tho&s;e parental arms which were ever open to receive her.</P>
<P>Trials, however, awaited her. It was nece&s;&s;ary that Mr. Hamilton, who was anxious to accelerate the hour that &s;hould honourably exonerate him from his embarra&s;&s;ments, and who was extremely de&s;irous of making provi&s;ion for the growing family which he had in pro&s;pect, &s;hould immediately apply to &s;ome bu&s;i|ne&s;s, which might afford an expectation of putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wi&s;hes &s;o indi&s;putably lauda|ble. A &s;hip bound for Europe, in which he was offered, with the probability of great commercial advantage, a very lucrative and honorary birth, propitiou&s;ly pre&s;ented. Of an opening &s;o fortunate, intere&s;t loudly called upon him to avail him&s;elf; the favourable gale of opportunity was not to be &s;lighted. But his heart bled for his Margaretta; yet manly de|ci&s;ion he&s;itated not, and every thing was in train for his departure. We conceived it advi&s;eable to conceal our purpo&s;e from my daughter as long as po&s;&s;ible; and it was not until two days previous to the period de&s;tined for his embarkation, that I took upon my&s;elf the painful ta&s;k of di&s;clo&s;ing to her an event, which we judged mu&s;t inevitably take place. Mary, Mi&s;s Clif|ford, Edward and my&s;elf, &s;eated with Margaretta, in a retired apartment, had for &s;ome time been employed in ob&s;erving her; while on her part &s;he &s;eemed whol|ly ab&s;orbed in contemplating the features of the little William, who, &s;leeping on a pillow before her, di&s;play|ed
<PB N="278" REF="034162_0277_0FFC649B6498CA28">
a countenance truly cherubic. Soul of &s;en&s;ibility! mo&s;t unwillingly did I recall her from her maternal reverie! but nece&s;&s;ity apparently impelling, I thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed her:</P>
<P>What is there that Mrs. Hamilton would not &s;acri|fice, to advance the happine&s;s of the little being, whom &s;he hath introduced into exi&s;tence? Margaretta &s;tart|ed&mdash;it &s;eemed as if her apprehen&s;ive bo&s;om compre|hended, in a &s;ingle in&s;tant, the agonizing intelligence which &s;he was about to receive. She continued, how|ever, &s;ilent, while urged by nece&s;&s;ity, I reluctantly pro|ceeded&mdash;There is a duty incumbent upon parents, to|wards their children, and from the moment of their birth they are bound to every po&s;&s;ible exertion, which they can rationally &s;uppo&s;e will contribute to their <HI>re|al felicity.</HI> Upon Margaretta Hamilton claims of this &s;ort will &s;oon be multiplied, and the probability is, that a long train of &s;ons and daughters will ri&s;e up and call her ble&s;&s;ed. Margaretta will not &s;urely be found deficient in her maternal character; the expen|&s;es attendant upon the education of young people, their advancement in life, e&s;tabli&s;hment, &amp;c. how quick|ly will they &s;ucceed. It is happy, that when a &s;ingle means of acquiring property fails, there are others which pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The ocean opens its ho&s;pitable arms to the unfortu|nate man, from whom every other re&s;ource is cut off; while the dangers, &s;uppo&s;ed peculiarly incident to a &s;eafaring life are in reality chimeras, calculated only to appal per&s;ons unaccu&s;tomed to reflect. Tho&s;e who acknowledge the &s;uperintendence of Providence, the exi&s;tence of Deity, if they a&s;cribe to him tho&s;e powers and properties which are e&s;&s;ential to the being of a God, mu&s;t acknowledge, that his protecting arm is, upon all occa&s;ions, &s;tretched forth; that he can pre|&s;erve upon the mighty waters with the &s;ame facility with which he upholdeth the dweller upon the land. The truth is, we are immortal until the &s;eparating warrant pa&s;&s;es the great &s;eal of Heaven; and, the breath arre&s;t|ed by a de&s;ignation &s;o inevitable, no arrangement can
<PB N="279" REF="034162_0278_0FFC64989B4DF998">
redeem. I flatter my&s;elf, my beloved Margaretta, that your mind, equal, energetic, and con&s;iderate, would not &s;uffer it&s;elf to be over much depre&s;&s;ed, &s;hould the vici&s;&s;itudes of life produce contingencies, unavoid|ably condemning you to a few months ab&s;ence from Mr. Hamilton; two or three voyages might perhaps entirely retrieve his affairs, and you would ever after have the &s;atisfaction to reflect that you had contributed every thing in your power; every thing which forti|tude and uniform exertions could achieve, in order to re-in&s;tate your Edward in that independence to which he was born. I was proceeding&mdash;but I had not been &s;ufficiently cautious. My daughter, during my ha|rangue, frequently changed colour; the lily and the ro&s;e &s;eemed to cha&s;e each other upon her now mant|ling, and now pallid cheek; &s;he trembled exce&s;&s;ively; and upon my particular application to her, the agita|tion of her bo&s;om, becoming in&s;upportable, &s;he &s;unk breathle&s;s into the arms of that pa&s;&s;ionately beloved, and truly afflicted hu&s;band, who ha&s;ted to prevent her fall.</P>
<P>"My God!" exclaimed Hamilton, <Q>it is too much; re&s;tore, compo&s;e, and &s;oothe this &s;uffering angel, too often exerci&s;ed by pangs of &s;o &s;evere a nature; and do, with a wretch who hath betrayed and undone her, whatever &s;eemeth to thee good.</Q></P>
<P>Mary and Serafina &s;oon recalled the fleeting &s;pirit of the lovely mourner. Hamilton once more kneeled before her, and the copious tears, with which he be|dewed the hand that he alternately pre&s;&s;ed to his bo&s;om and to his lips, called forth a mingling &s;tream from the eyes of the beauteous &s;ufferer. The &s;cene was inex|pre&s;&s;ively tender, but the humid drops upon the face of my daughter annihilated at lea&s;t one half of my fears upon her account. "And can you, Sir," in a tremulous accent &s;he exclaimed&mdash;<Q>can you condemn my Edward to bondage, perhaps to irretrievable &s;lavery?</Q> What means my love? <Q>Ah, Sir! do you not recollect Briti&s;h depredations? Do you not rec|ollect the ruthle&s;s and unrelenting rigour of that

fate which awaits the captive, doomed to wear out a wretched life under the galling yoke of an Algerine de&s;pot? Might I but have been &s;pared at this time! might a &s;tep &s;o fatal to my peace, at lea&s;t have been deferred, until the face of affairs wore, to the poor, de&s;olate, and exiled voyager, a more confirmed a&s;|pect, I think I could have acquie&s;ced.</Q> For a mo|ment &s;he pau&s;ed; &s;ighs, expre&s;&s;ive of the deepe&s;t angui&s;h, bur&s;t from her bo&s;om. Again &s;he re&s;umed&mdash;<Q>Gracious Heaven! what an exten&s;ive and wide &s;preading error hath my early indi&s;cretion proved! and perhaps its cruel con&s;equences will follow me to the late&s;t period of my exi&s;tence! <HI>Had I waited the parental &s;anction, ere I lent an ear to a wretch, prac|ti&s;ed in the arts of deception;</HI> had I not blindly and precipitately given the reins to reprehen&s;ible inclina|tion, I &s;hould never have li&s;tened to the pernicious voice of adulation; the faithful heart of my Edward would not have received a corroding wound; he would not have been impelled to a voluntary bani&s;h|ment; he would never have had recour&s;e to an ex|pedient, which hath too &s;urely involved in ruin my terre&s;trial hopes! Forgive me, O my parents! for|give me, O thou be&s;t of men! and thou &s;leeping innocent, forgive, O forgive thy wretched mother! It is now indeed that Margaretta is completely un|done!</Q></P>
<P>I was immea&s;urably affected; yet I knew that my daughter would &s;oon become capable of rea&s;oning. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in an uncommon degree, the power of accurately di&s;cu&s;&s;ing points, in which &s;he is the mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted; but altogether unprepared for the pre&s;ent calamity, rea&s;on had been violently forced from the helm, and we unitedly endeavoured to re|&s;tore her to that reflection, to which we well knew &s;he was eminently adequate. The &s;oothings of unque&s;|tioned friend&s;hip are the &s;weete&s;t &s;olace; they yield a balm which is endowed with the &s;overeign power of mitigation, and they are a con&s;olation in almo&s;t every &s;orrow. It was nece&s;&s;ary to bend the mind of Mar|garetta

to our purpo&s;e, and a few hours accompli&s;hed our wi&s;hes; gradually we opened our plan; &s;he &s;aw the propriety of every arrangement; the nece&s;&s;ity for the &s;teps we had taken, and the idea, then fir&s;t held up, of the po&s;&s;ibility that the time was not far di&s;tant, which might legally immure her Hamilton within the walls of a pri&s;on, produced the expected effect. Wav|ing her &s;nowy hand with peerle&s;s grace, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed it upon her clo&s;ed lips, and bowing her afflicted head, thus tacitly gave that expre&s;&s;ive, although melancholy a&s;&s;ent, of which, from the beginning, con&s;idering the ju&s;tne&s;s of her way of thinking, we had made our&s;elves &s;ure. Two days, as I &s;aid, only remained, and they were marked by a deeper &s;orrow, than any which has yet pierced the bo&s;om of my daughter! It will not be doubted, that we called into action every motive which could give energy and firmne&s;s to her feelings; yet, while pen&s;ive re&s;ignation dwelt upon her lips, her altered countenance and debilitated frame evinced the &s;truggles of her &s;oul. It was a trial upon which &s;he had never reckoned; in every event, &s;he had calculated upon the &s;upporting pre&s;ence of her hu&s;band, and that &s;he was thus unprepared for the &s;troke, mu&s;t apologize for the agonized emotions with which &s;he &s;ubmitted to the blow! The evening at length arrived, which we conceived de&s;tined to u&s;her in the morning, upon which our adventurer was to depart for a neigh|bouring town, in order to his embarkation, and its progre&s;s was noted by the heart-felt &s;ighs of corrod|ing angui&s;h.</P>
<P>But ju&s;t at this juncture, unfortunately, as I then imagined, our Federal Government interpo&s;ed the late embargo, and joy once more mantled upon the cheek of Mrs. Hamilton. Thus it is, we &s;ubmit to nece&s;&s;ity; we are convinced of the utility of certain arrange|ments, and we are con&s;trained, by conviction, to yield our a&s;&s;ent to events which, neverthele&s;s, pierce the bo|&s;om with the barbed arrows of affliction: Yet, if an interpo&s;ing hand breaks the order to which we had reluctantly &s;ubmitted; if we are con&s;cious that we
<PB N="282" REF="034162_0281_0FFC649153923548">
have no how aided in producing the incident; if we have, in every re&s;pect, acted up to our duty, we &s;eem to forget the good we had expected; we rejoice in a change, which emancipates us from tho&s;e &s;orrows we had impo&s;ed upon our&s;elves; we &s;eem to have attain|ed the goal of felicity; and, for a little moment, we become unmindful of tho&s;e compul&s;ory con&s;iderations, which had urged the application of a remedy, ac|knowledged indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite. Margaretta, not|with&s;tanding the good &s;en&s;e of which &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of rea&s;on&mdash;not only regarded the embargo as a reprieve, but involuntarily breathed her wi&s;hes for its continuance; and I produce it as an irrefragable fact, that our country contains not a &s;ingle partizan, who&s;e bo&s;om glowed with more ill-advi&s;ed zeal, for the exten&s;ion or renewal of this &s;ame embargo. The 25th in&s;tant, however, arrived&mdash;it pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;the fleet and welcome foot&s;teps of no new commi&s;&s;ioned expre&s;s gladdened the ear of impetuo&s;ity&mdash;and the embargo expired&mdash;Hamilton was again on the eve of his departure. Ye&s;terday, exactly at one o'clock, we were a&s;&s;embled in the dining parlour. This very morning was to have witne&s;&s;ed the agon|ized moment of &s;eparation&mdash;and melancholy dejection brooded in the countenance of Margaretta.</P>
<P>My &s;ervant, a man whom I have loved for the&s;e forty years, entered:&mdash;"A &s;tranger, Sir, is importu|nate to &s;ee you." Admit him, by all means. Marga|retta was ha&s;ting from the parlour; &s;he was &s;olicitous to hide her grief from the ob&s;ervation of the uninter|e&s;ted; but the &s;tranger was clo&s;e upon the heels of the &s;ervant, and not being able to make her e&s;cape, &s;he withdrew to the window.</P>
<P>The gentleman, the &s;tranger, I &s;ay, entered; upon his features were imprinted the &s;tronge&s;t marks of per|turbed and tender anxiety; and, moreover, they were features <HI>with which I was confident I had long been familiar,</HI> although, for my &s;oul, I could not recollect at what time, or in what place, they had met my view. He, however, fixing his inquiring eyes, with impatient

&s;olicitude, on the face of my wife, and drawing up a heavy &s;igh, thus laconically apologized:</P>
<P><Q>Excu&s;e me, Madam, excu&s;e me, Sir&mdash;but my feel|ings di&s;dain ceremony.</Q> The &s;crutiny under which the countenance of Mary pa&s;&s;ed, was &s;oon performed; and Mi&s;s Clifford next engaged the attention of a man, who, but for the benign a&s;cendancy, which, amid the mo&s;t tumultuous agitation I had ever witne&s;&s;ed, was &s;till con&s;picuous in his countenance, I &s;hould have con|cluded, entirely deprived of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>"You are lovely," he exclaimed, addre&s;&s;ing Mi&s;s Clifford, <Q>but you are not the angel&mdash;at lea&s;t, I think you are not&mdash;of whom I am in pur&s;uit.&mdash;Tell me, Mr. Vigillius; tell me, ye incomparable pair! ye who have &s;till continued the matchle&s;s guardians of my long lo&s;t and uncea&s;ingly lamented Margaretta, what apartment in this happy dwelling contains my only &s;urviving trea&s;ure?</Q> Margaretta, who had &s;ought to hide her &s;orrow-marked vi&s;age from the gaze of a &s;tranger, now, lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment, mechanically turning from the window, pre&s;ented to his view her tearful face; &s;he catched a glance, and, faintly &s;hriek|ing, would have &s;unk upon the floor, had not the &s;tranger, whom we now regarded with a kind of indig|nant horror, &s;natched her to his embrace! Our re|&s;entment, however, &s;oon gave place to all tho&s;e en|raptured emotions, which the acce&s;&s;ion of high and unexpected felicity originates in the bo&s;om, when, in a voice expre&s;&s;ive of paternal tenderne&s;s, of paternal tran&s;port, he &s;oothingly &s;aid&mdash;</P>

&s;u&s;pend its functions; and while &s;he &s;eemed, in the arms of the &s;tranger, an almo&s;t lifele&s;s cor&s;e, her lips yet moved, and every charming feature received an extatic kind of ejaculatory impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Among the trinkets belonging to her mother, which had come into her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on the death of Mrs. Ar|buthnot, was a miniature picture of her father: Per|haps there was not a &s;ingle day, on which &s;he did not gaze with filial devotion upon this picture. It was a &s;triking likene&s;s; and, by its general contour, her mind was &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed. Hence the effect pro|duced, by a &s;ingle glance at the original; and it was a frequent ob&s;ervation of this picture, that occa&s;ioned the confu&s;ed recollection, for which, upon the fir&s;t ap|pearance of the &s;tranger, I was at a lo&s;s to account.</P>
<P>It cannot be matter of wonder, that at an interview &s;o a&s;toni&s;hingly intere&s;ting, not an individual retained that &s;elf-command, &s;o requi&s;ite to common forms: At length, however, recollection re&s;umed, in a degree, its office. Mary conducted Mrs. Hamilton to a &s;ofa, when, a flood of tears unlocking for her the powers of utterance, with a look of profound and dignified veneration, &s;he quitted her &s;eat, and &s;uddenly kneeling before the honoured man, in this devotional attitude, with cla&s;ped hands, and in broken accents, &s;he per|turbedly que&s;tioned&mdash;<Q>Art thou a &s;pirit ble&s;t&mdash;di&s;|patched from Heaven's high court to &s;oothe thy &s;orrowing child?&mdash;or art thou indeed my father? Ha&s;t thou never ta&s;ted death? and, if thou ha&s;t not, by what miracle did&s;t thou e&s;cape tho&s;e tremendous waves, which we have &s;uppo&s;ed commi&s;&s;ioned for thy de&s;truction?</Q> Mr. Melworth, for&s;ooth, to &s;ay it was he, his very &s;elf, rai&s;ed his kneeling child, and again cla&s;ping her to his paternal bo&s;om, in &s;trains of exqui&s;ite tenderne&s;s, affectionately replied&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Be comforted, my love; be compo&s;ed, my heart's be&s;t trea&s;ure; I am indeed thy father. At a proper time, thou &s;halt be made acquainted with every par|ticular; and, in the interim, as I have been inform|ed of thy embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, know, that

"Then he &s;hall not go," &s;he ex|claimed&mdash;<Q>Avaunt, ye brooding fiends, that hover round the land of murder!&mdash;ye &s;hall not intercept the virtuous career of Hamilton&mdash;ye &s;hall not pre|&s;ume to manacle tho&s;e hands that have, a thou&s;and times, been &s;tretched forth to wipe the tear from the face of &s;orrow&mdash;Avaunt, ye hell-born fiends!&mdash;Al|giers, united for his de&s;truction, &s;hall not detain him; for lo, a ble&s;&s;ed father de&s;cends from heaven, to &s;ave his well near &s;inking Margaretta!</Q></P>
<P>Edward, who, from the entrance of Mr. Melworth, had remained, as it were, entranced, or petrified by a&s;|toni&s;hment, rou&s;ed by his fears for the rea&s;on of Mar|garetta, now coming forward, pro&s;trated him&s;elf at the feet of Mr. Melworth. No one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficient compo&s;ure to introduce him&mdash;nor was this nece&s;&s;ary; the &s;trong &s;en&s;ations which pervaded his almo&s;t bur&s;ting heart, in&s;cribing upon every manly and ex|pre&s;&s;ive feature, veneration, joy, gratitude, and appre|hen&s;ion, emphatically pointed him out, and rendered a doubt impo&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>And, gentle reader, for thy con&s;olation, I give thee my word and honour, that the very next Gleaner, by recounting to thee every particular, relative to Mr. Melworth, which &s;hall come to my knowledge, &s;hall, if it is within the compa&s;s of my power, amply gratify a curio&s;ity, which thou neede&s;t not he&s;itate to own, and which I &s;hould have been mortified in the extreme, not to have excited.</P>

<P>THE author, who leaves nothing to the imagina|tion of his readers, is frequently accu&s;ed of blameable arrogance; and it is often a&s;&s;erted that, puffed up by an over-weening &s;elf-conceit, he vainly &s;uppo&s;es, that the germ of fancy can flouri&s;h no where but in the &s;oil of his own wonderful pericranium.</P>
<P>Now, as the fact is, that I am anxiou&s;ly &s;olicitous to avoid every occa&s;ion of offence, I &s;hall (taking into con&s;ideration the feelings of &s;en&s;ibility, and properly influenced by an idea of the ingenuity which is its ac|companiment) wave the de&s;cription of tho&s;e delightful &s;en&s;ations, which, in rapturous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, were the nat|ural appendages of the introduction of the father of Margaretta. The extatic fondne&s;s with which he hung upon the accents of his daughter&mdash;the mingling plea&s;ures and regrets&mdash;the big emotions which &s;ur|pri&s;ed his &s;oul, as he traced each lovely feature&mdash;tho&s;e well-known features, which exhibited to his view a beau|teous

tran&s;cript of tho&s;e that he had early learned to admire in the face of her departed mother&mdash;the ex|qui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations with which he traced the kindred lineaments&mdash;comparing them &s;eparately and collect|ively with a miniature of his lady, which he wore in his bo&s;om, and which might have pa&s;&s;ed for an exact copy of Mrs. Hamilton&mdash;the glowing expre&s;&s;ions of paternal tenderne&s;s, with which he folded the little William to his bo&s;om&mdash;the marked approbation, une|quivocally demon&s;trated toward every movement of the hu&s;band of his Margaretta&mdash;the manly and com|placent regards that he be&s;towed upon Mi&s;s Clifford&mdash;the &s;weet incen&s;e of expan&s;ive and immea&s;urable prai&s;e, that he addre&s;&s;ed to me, &s;tyling me the &s;aviour, the benefactor, the genuine father of his poor orphan girl&mdash;the elevated regards, &s;hort only of adoration, which he devoted to my dear Mary&mdash;tho&s;e charming effu|&s;ions, con&s;i&s;ting in expre&s;&s;ive looks, broken words, and unambiguous ge&s;tures; effu&s;ions which were the &s;pon|taneous growth of uncommon felicity, the reciprocity of exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction which we abundantly inhaled&mdash;All this, and whatever el&s;e the &s;oul of &s;en&s;ibility can conceive, gladly do I refer to the glowing mind of the <HI>feeling &s;entimentali&s;t;</HI> and I do hereby inve&s;t imagin|ation, in the utmo&s;t latitude of its powers, with full &s;cope; it is impo&s;&s;ible it can paint too high; language is indeed in&s;ufficient, and the mo&s;t vivid tints of fancy can alone pourtray.</P>
<P>Nay, gentle reader, I take upon me to a&s;&s;ert, that however elaborately thou maye&s;t fini&s;h thy picture, after thou has be&s;towed upon it thy la&s;t touches, it may, after all, fall va&s;tly &s;hort of the original; and, right &s;orry am I, that my powers are &s;o circum&s;cribed, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for me to place it in its genuine lu&s;tre before thee. But, finite efforts, being doomed to &s;ubmit to a nece&s;&s;ity, the effects of which it mu&s;t ever be unavailing to lament; we will, without further preamble, proceed in our narration. And here I would not have thee conceive, that I am &s;o unrea&s;onable as to condemn thee to the drudgery of accounting for the
<PB N="288" REF="034162_0287_0FFC648247F7CB80">
&s;udden appearance of Mr. Melworth, nor can I con|&s;ent, that, &s;etting me down as a de&s;cendant of Merlin, thou &s;hould&s;t place in my hand the magic wand; in|ve&s;t me with the powers of incantation, the gift of working miracles, or, of &s;ummoning "<HI>&s;pirits from the va&s;ty deep.</HI>" No, believe me, I am no conjurer, and the better to bani&s;h every idea of a &s;upernatural inter|po&s;ition, I ha&s;ten to bring forward the promi&s;ed facts. Imagine then, that the tumultuous and perturbed &s;en|&s;ations of ungovernable tran&s;port, which were con&s;e|quent upon the late developement, are &s;ucceeded by that kind of &s;atisfaction which is the re&s;ult of high com|placency in the pre&s;ent, and the mo&s;t agreeable antici|pations of the future; or by that &s;tate of tranquillity, which mu&s;t always be con&s;idered as a de&s;irable &s;ub|&s;titute for the hurricane of the pa&s;&s;ions, whatever may be the magnitude of the event which produced it. The extreme of joy and &s;orrow, originating commotions as de&s;tructive to the order of the mental &s;y&s;tem, as the up|rooting &s;torm to the apparent harmony of the natural world; the mild and equal di&s;po&s;ition cannot but re|gard as a relief, the regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events. Im|agine that our happy circle is retired to the little apart|ment &s;acred to &s;entimental plea&s;ures; to that apart|ment, upon which the &s;tep of incon&s;iderate levity, or indifference, obtrudeth not. Margaretta is &s;eated be|tween her enraptured father, and that hu&s;band, who experiences for her exemplary worth, with every ri&s;ing hour, augmenting admiration and new e&s;teem. Ma|ry, Serafina and my&s;elf, complete the group, and Mr. Melworth, pre&s;&s;ing the hand of Mrs. Hamilton, thus commences his intere&s;ting communications.</P>
<Q><P>I ob&s;erved, my dear, the &s;weet blu&s;h that tinged thy lovely cheek, upon my mentioning in terms of rep|rehen&s;ion, the name of Mrs. Arbuthnot; yet you mu&s;t allow for the feelings of a de&s;olate father&mdash;but for her unforgiving and obdurate &s;pirit, the probabil|ity is, that your angelic mother would, at this delight|ful moment, have partook, and doubled all tho&s;e ex|qui&s;itely charming &s;en&s;ations, which &s;well a parent's
<PB N="289" REF="034162_0288_0FFC6480C39799F8">
bo&s;om, and which pre&s;ent &s;uch an ample compen&s;ation for every evil. From the hour which ble&s;&s;ed me with the hand of my Margaretta, &s;he continued &s;edulou&s;ly intent on procuring a reconciliation with her &s;i&s;ter; for the companion of her youth the &s;igh of her bo&s;om &s;till aro&s;e, and while the utter improbability of obtain|ing her wi&s;hes embittered our mo&s;t plea&s;urable mo|ments, her inten&s;e and unavailing &s;olicitude vi&s;ibly impaired her health!</P>
<P>I flattered my&s;elf that the period which gave thee, my love, to her arms, would &s;upply that void in her heart, which, however ardent the attachment of your &s;ex to the man of their choice may be, &s;uch is the del|icacy of the female mind, a tender and re&s;pectable <HI>fe|male friend</HI> can alone fill. Your mother, my dear, was early left an orphan. Her &s;i&s;ter had for a long peri|od reigned &s;upreme in her bo&s;om. Fate pre&s;ented her not a Mrs. Vigillius; goodne&s;s &s;o unexampled is not the growth of every clime; neither was a Sera|fina Clifford contained in the circle of her connexions. Yet, as I had hoped, the birth of her daughter opened a &s;ource of new and exhau&s;tle&s;s plea&s;ure; and when &s;he cla&s;ped her lovely infant to her bo&s;om, &s;he forgot, for a moment, her &s;i&s;ter; but memory, too faithful to its office, officiou&s;ly pre&s;ented the mirror.&mdash;"Dear im|placable Henrietta!" &s;he exclaimed, "why wilt thou &s;tand aloof? why wilt thou refu&s;e to heighten the tran&s;ports of this delicious period? Thy pre&s;ence, thy &s;anction would indeed add a completion to my feli|city, which would mark me the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed of women!</P>
<P>The novelty, however, the &s;oft endearments, the thou&s;and namele&s;s perturbations, and tender intere&s;t of the maternal character, were powerful alleviations, and the tranquillity of the mother was in a mea&s;ure re|&s;tored. Eighteen halcyon months revolved, when fate, as if envious of our felicity, pre&s;ented me with a pro&s;|pect of obtaining great emolument, by engaging on board a &s;hip bound for the Ea&s;t-Indies. I was flatter|ed by the idea of obtaining for my Margaretta and her infant, an elegant independence, and that re&s;olution
<PB N="290" REF="034162_0289_0FFC647D348F2788">
which became the &s;uper&s;tructure of a ba&s;is &s;o proper and &s;o deeply laid, could not be ea&s;ily &s;haken. Mar|garetta, while &s;he acknowledged the eligibility of my plan, &s;hrunk from its execution. Her tenderly ap|prehen&s;ive bo&s;om foreboded a thou&s;and evils. Yet the heroi&s;m of her character can never be too much ad|mired.</P>
<P>"Go, my Charles"&mdash;with emotions of tender and unutterable agony, &s;he exclaimed&mdash;"&s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, go!&mdash;and may the upholding hand of Heaven be, in every event, thy never-failing &s;upport!" Repeated|ly &s;he &s;obbed out the convul&s;ed and agonizing adieu, while ingenious in inventions to retard my departure, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me to her throbbing heart. "Oh! my love," in broken accents &s;he whi&s;pered, "if we meet again, we &s;hall then be happy. But alas! alas!" &s;he could not add. Yet &s;till her cla&s;ped hands and &s;tream|ing eyes continued to &s;upplicate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of that God, on whom her firm reliance was invariably placed. I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly moved. My &s;oul was little le&s;s tempe&s;ted; yet the &s;plendour of my pro&s;pects, my pre|vious arrangements, my pledged honour, all urged me on; and, by one violent effort, I tore my&s;elf from the mo&s;t beloved of women! Our mutual &s;ufferings may be regarded as a prediction of the fatal event. It was decreed that we never more &s;hould meet! Propitious gales attended the fir&s;t part of our voyage, and I had began to anticipate the rich harve&s;t that a few painful &s;ea&s;ons would enable me to lay at the feet of my heart's be&s;t trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>We had already doubled the &s;outhern extremity of the great continent of Africa, commonly called the Cape of Good Hope; and, &s;haping our cour&s;e north-ea&s;t to the continent of India, we were proceeding with all di&s;patch&mdash;when, lo! on a &s;udden, the &s;cowl|ing atmo&s;phere gathered darkne&s;s; dreadfully por|tentous the winds of heaven aro&s;e. Waves beat on waves frightfully tempe&s;tuous. The tumultuous ocean &s;eemed to la&s;h the contending &s;kies. Louder and louder the de&s;tructive whirlwinds bellowed round.
<PB N="291" REF="034162_0290_0FFC647BAEF1FD78">
Hoar&s;e thunders roared terrific peals &s;ucceeding peals. The heavens poured forth a deluge of rain, and the forked lightnings were all abroad. Surrounded on every &s;ide by the tremendous world of waters, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance was impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;no a&s;ylum pre&s;ented. The &s;ea|man's art was in vain, and death, in its mo&s;t &s;hocking form, appeared inevitable. But to de&s;cribe the hor|rors of our &s;ituation is beyond the reach of language. In the latitude in which we then were, there is a large ridge of rocks, they are pointed out in mo&s;t of our &s;ea charts; but if our pilot was aware of them, it was not in his power to avoid them; they accelerated that fate which, imagining the &s;hip might live many hours, I had not &s;o &s;peedily expected; and, bilging in&s;tantly upon one of tho&s;e rocks, a &s;econd &s;troke &s;evered her in twain! The &s;hrieks of the mariners were &s;hocking be|yond expre&s;&s;ion. How long they &s;urvived, or what ef|forts they made, I am not able to &s;ay; for, &s;eizing a part of a &s;hattered raft, upon which, floating at the mercy of the winds, and waves, while I momently ex|pected di&s;&s;olution, I commended my &s;pirit to that God who&s;e protection and who&s;e favour I had never cea&s;ed to invoke.</P>
<P>And how many of the children of men have been con&s;trained to a&s;k, What circum&s;tances are beyond the reach of Omnipotence? <HI>He who holdeth in the hol|low of his hand, the great deep,</HI> &s;uddenly hu&s;hed the winds; and, driven upon a &s;mall uninhabited i&s;land, my fir&s;t &s;en&s;ations, it will not be doubted, &s;pontaneou&s;ly i&s;&s;ued in the mo&s;t grateful ori&s;ons to the God of my life, who had thus graciou&s;ly interpo&s;ed for my pre&s;|ervation. But &s;oon the image of my Margaretta, clothed in the habiliments of immea&s;urable woe, har|rowed up my &s;oul; her forlorn and helple&s;s &s;ituation&mdash;her unprotected infant!&mdash;My God! madne&s;s was in the thought. I was on the point of again plunging into that ocean from which I had &s;o recently e&s;caped; but the good hand of upholding Deity &s;till prevented me, and was &s;till my &s;hield. Gradually the heavens re&s;umed a &s;erene a&s;pect; my mind too became a&s;toni&s;h|ingly
<PB N="292" REF="034162_0291_0FFC647A2C028678">
calm; and, drying the only ve&s;tments which now remained to me upon a &s;un-beat rock, who&s;e craggy &s;ides received the mo&s;t inten&s;e rays of that luminary, beneath the foliage of a &s;heltering tree I &s;tretched my weary limbs. Sleep &s;pread over me its downy mantle, and I obtained a temporary oblivion of tho&s;e lacerat|ing reflections, with which &s;ucceeding hours, in dread|ful order, appalled my &s;inking &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Nece&s;&s;ity compelled me to &s;earch out the good, if any remained, which was yet within my gra&s;p. At the &s;alutary &s;tream I &s;laked my thir&s;t; the nutri|tious berry, ze&s;ted by hunger, afforded me a delicious repa&s;t, and by one &s;oothing hope I was &s;till buoyed up: I traced unequivocal ve&s;tiges of the human &s;tep&mdash;&s;hips, I was po&s;itive, had recently touched there&mdash;I might yet recognize my fellow man&mdash;I might yet be borne to my native i&s;le. De&s;pair, however, too often gained the a&s;cendancy, and at &s;uch intervals, inexpre&s;|&s;ible angui&s;h overwhelmed my &s;oul. But it is impo&s;&s;ible to paint the unequalled calamities of his &s;ituation, who is thus circum&s;tanced. Even the glowing imagination of a Thom&s;on could only &s;ketch them. Yet, not a revolving hour but heard me, to the li&s;tening echo, repeat&mdash;
<Q><L>Unhappy he! who from the fir&s;t of joys,</L>
<L>Society, cut off, is left alone</L>
<L>Amid this world of death. Day after day,</L>
<L>Sad on the jutting eminence he &s;its,</L>
<L>And views the main that ever toils below;</L>
<L>Ships, dim di&s;cover'd, dropping from the clouds;</L>
<L>At evening to the &s;etting &s;un he turns</L>
<L>A mournful eye, and down his <HI>dying heart</HI></L>
<L>Sinks hopele&s;s; while the <HI>wonted roar</HI> is up,</L>
<L>And hi&s;s continual through the tedious night.</L></Q>
But forever ble&s;&s;ed be the all-gracious Di&s;po&s;er of events! the term of my &s;ufferings was cut &s;hort. It was the employment of my fir&s;t rational moment, af|ter I had been thrown upon the i&s;land, to make, with a part of my clothing, a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s. Upon a prominent angle a&s;cended a &s;mall acclivity, on the &s;ummit of which &s;tood the tall trunk of a tree, that
<PB N="293" REF="034162_0292_0FFA6529311D45D0">
contending &s;torms had &s;tripped of its branches. To this di&s;robed trunk I contrived to fa&s;ten the beacon of my di&s;tre&s;s, and I con&s;ecrated it, with many &s;upplica|tions to Him who was alone able to &s;ave.</P>
<P>The morning of the fifth day (after I had &s;o providentially e&s;caped the waves) broke divinely &s;e|rene. An amazing continuity was out&s;tretched before me. With &s;olded arms, and an aching heart, I con|templated the exten&s;ive main. The frightful &s;olitude, the awful &s;tillne&s;s to which I was condemned, aro&s;e dreadfully terrific to my &s;oul. I threw abroad my anxiou&s;ly inquiring gaze; a cloud &s;eemed to gather at a di&s;tance&mdash;It is not a cloud&mdash;What can it be?&mdash;Swiftly it approaches&mdash;Great God! is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;Saviour of &s;inners! it is, indeed, the white &s;ails of a Heav|en directed bark!&mdash;It is bending toward me!&mdash;Ah! it recedes, and my bounding &s;pirit dies within me!</P>
<P>Again, however, its altered cour&s;e bore rapidly down upon my de&s;olate abode. The in&s;ignia of ca|lamity reared not in vain its petitioning head. The nece&s;&s;ary arrangements were made. The boat was manned. My heart leaped exulting; it was too big for its pri&s;on. My tongue refu&s;ed utterance, while, with that commi&s;erating cordiality, which &s;eamen know &s;o well to practi&s;e, and which is a characteri&s;tic trait of their order, I was received on board the &s;hip. To complete my joy, the captain and crew were Engli&s;h. The captain was a humane and venerable man, who had numbered more than three&s;core years: A &s;hower of tears relieved my bur&s;ting heart. I told my tale of woe, and he regarded me with even paternal goodne&s;s. Few know how to re&s;pect the unfortunate; ine&s;timable are the &s;oothings of benevolence to the children of ad|ver&s;ity.</P>
<P>A tedious voyage was now to be performed: and although a proper &s;en&s;e of the divine interpo&s;ition in my favour, forbid every murmur, yet a recurrence to tho&s;e pangs which I well knew would lacerate the gentle bo&s;om of her my &s;oul held mo&s;t dear, could not fail of pointing the keene&s;t arrows of affliction! Ten long
<PB N="294" REF="034162_0293_0FFC6475AAADE358">
months (dating from the time of my departure) per|formed their tedious round, ere the white cliffs of Al|bion again met my longing gaze. With what extacy did I leap upon the &s;trand. To the parent &s;oil I low|ly bent my head; with filial lips I ki&s;&s;ed the kindred turf, and my bounding &s;pirit, &s;truggling with its ming|ling &s;en&s;ations, poured forth the rapt ori&s;ons of a &s;hip|wrecked, exiled, re&s;cued, and re&s;tored man! On the wings of &s;peed I ha&s;ted to my native village; to that village which I &s;uppo&s;ed contained my only trea&s;ure. But what became of me, when, po&s;ting to the apart|ments of Margaretta, I found them occupied by &s;tran|gers!&mdash;Yet, hope &s;till whi&s;pered &s;he had removed to &s;ome other abode; and I ha&s;ted to the dwelling of a friend, from whom I learned the &s;um of my misfor|tunes!!</P>
<P>You are, my friends, acquainted with the feelings of the heart. Every feature in your expre&s;&s;ive coun|tenances are vouchers of your &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;Why &s;hould I aim at delineation!</P>
<LG>
<L>When to the height of hopele&s;s &s;orrow wrought,</L>
<L>The fainting &s;pirit feels a pang of thought,</L>
<L>Which, never painted in the hues of &s;peech,</L>
<L>Lives at the &s;oul, and mocks expre&s;&s;ion's reach.</L>
</LG>
<P>I drop the curtain over a train of &s;ucceeding ills; &s;ickne&s;s, lo&s;s of rea&s;on, comfortle&s;s calamities!</P>
<P>Mrs. Arbuthnot, when &s;he accompanied her hu&s;|band to Ireland, bore my child with her. My aged, widowed mother, gently remon&s;trated. My &s;uppo&s;ed death, and the demi&s;e of Margaretta, had centered her every remaining wi&s;h in the little prattler. Mrs. Ar|buthnot plead the dying injunctions and beque&s;t of her &s;i&s;ter. This was deci&s;ive. The regulations &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the everla&s;tingly ab&s;ent &s;hould be deemed inviolably &s;acred, and my mother with floods of una|vailing tears &s;ubmitted. A few painful weeks devoted to heartfelt regret, had &s;ucceeded a &s;eparation judged unavoidable, when my unfortunate mother received a line from Mrs. Arbuthnot, acquainting her that the little Margaretta was no more. This proved a fini&s;h|ing
<PB N="295" REF="034162_0294_0FFC6473F1A12788">
&s;troke. So many calamities, in &s;uch &s;wift &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, treading upon the heels of each other, brought down the grey hairs of my aged parent with &s;orrow to the grave. Could &s;he have been &s;pared to have witne&s;&s;ed the returning foot&s;teps of the &s;on of her youth, a gleam of joy would have diffu&s;ed its genial and &s;olac|ing influence over her parting &s;pirit. But Heaven de|creed otherwi&s;e, and &s;he clo&s;ed a life, the &s;orrows of which had accumulated with every added moment! What could induce Mrs. Arbuthnot to pen a mi&s;repre|&s;entation, calculated to pierce with &s;o keen a &s;haft the bo&s;om of an aged and &s;orrow worn &s;ufferer, I can only conjecture. Probably &s;he might be influenced by her plan of pa&s;&s;ing the child for her own; or, &s;he might imagine that my mother, being inve&s;ted with the rights of a parent, would again demand the child, &s;hould the contingencies, peculiar to a &s;oldier's life, remove Cap|tain Arbuthnot (whom it was well known &s;he deter|mined to follow) to a remote or foreign de&s;tination; and it may be pre&s;umed that &s;he made up the matter in her own mind, by a con&s;ideration that if &s;he return|ed her niece to our village, the extreme age of my mother, would &s;oon leave her de&s;titute of every nat|ural guide.</P>
<P>For me, after a long and debilitating fever, ob|taining a &s;tate of convale&s;cence,&mdash;youth, and a con&s;ti|tution uncommonly good, &s;oon completed my re&s;tora|tion. The &s;ame intere&s;t which had before placed me on board an Ea&s;t-India &s;hip, procured me a &s;econd em|ployment. I made &s;everal &s;ucce&s;sful voyages. I ac|cumulated riches; and at length &s;aw my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of affluence. But alas! tranquillity was not in the gift of affluence. In the variety by which I was &s;ur|rounded my heart took no intere&s;t; and it refu&s;ed to acknowledge a &s;econd attachment. Yet I determined to regulate my feelings by the dictates of fortitude, and to bend my wayward &s;pirit to a &s;tate of acquie&s;cence in the de&s;ignation of that God who ruleth in the heav|ens. I became a citizen of the world; and, con&s;ider|ing my&s;elf born for the univer&s;al family, and for the
<PB N="296" REF="034162_0295_0FFC647088246960">
emolument of my fellow men, I indu&s;triou&s;ly made the mo&s;t of every acqui&s;ition. Under the influence of this &s;entiment I proceeded in the career of life; and if my path produced not tho&s;e high &s;cented perfumes, of which the exqui&s;ite &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of dome&s;tic enjoy|ments is &s;u&s;ceptible, I was, notwith&s;tanding, &s;o far favoured, as to obtain a degree of compo&s;ure. Thus rolled on &s;ucceeding years, until upon an uncommon fine night, three months &s;ince, feeling no di&s;po&s;ition to retire to my chamber, I felt con&s;trained to devote an hour to a contemplative walk, and after having &s;trolled &s;ome moments upon the road-&s;ide, I bent my &s;teps toward St. George's fields, where, experiencing an unu&s;ual kind of perturbation, with folded arms, and rai&s;ed eyes, I continued my de&s;ultory aberration.</P>
<P>Methought the &s;hade of my Margaretta accom|panied my &s;teps: The ample heavens, the &s;tarry lumi|naries, the full orb'd moon, the blue expan&s;e; the&s;e all combined to image the beauteous form of her, on whom fond remembrance &s;till regretting dwelt.</P>
<P>An a&s;&s;ociation of ideas gave birth to a wi&s;h, to pa&s;s &s;ome moments be&s;ide a &s;ketch of tho&s;e waters, on which, bidding an eternal adieu to the injured &s;ufferer, I had heretofore cruelly embarked; and toward We&s;t|min&s;ter bridge I rapidly took my way, which having reached, with an expedition for which I could not ac|count, I de&s;cended the &s;teps of the landing place; but no &s;ooner had I put my foot upon the third &s;tair than an unu&s;ual da&s;h of the waters of the Thames, for which the &s;tillne&s;s of the night rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on, &s;till further accelerated my move|ments. I ha&s;ted forward, and was only in time to &s;eize by his garments, an unfortunate man, who had plunged into the &s;tream, with the unwarrantable pur|po&s;e of putting a period to his exi&s;tence. I remon|&s;trated again&s;t the atrocious audacity of the deed that he had well near perpetrated, in terms expre&s;&s;ive of the horror which it in&s;pired. For a time he pre&s;erved an indignant kind of &s;ilence; and when he deigned to ut|ter him&s;elf, he breathed only expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;entment,
<PB N="297" REF="034162_0296_0FFC646F04BA0D70">
for what he termed my officious interpo&s;ition. It was manife&s;t that his rea&s;on was di&s;ordered, and pity grew in my &s;oul. I addre&s;&s;ed him in the language of com|mi&s;eration, and he gradually became &s;oftened and com|municative.</P>
<P>"Generous &s;tranger," he exclaimed, "I give thee no mark of confidence in the brief recital, which as an apology for my &s;uppo&s;ed ra&s;hne&s;s, your apparent com|mi&s;eration demands. To him, who is re&s;olved on death, the di&s;clo&s;ure of &s;ecrets which effect only him&s;elf, can be of little importance. Know then, that, born to af|fluence, I was bred a gentleman. Know al&s;o, that, pur&s;uing my plea&s;ures in a neighbouring kingdom, I &s;aw and <HI>loved</HI> a beauteous woman. I <HI>wooed</HI> and <HI>won</HI> her. Her parents were no more; but her brethren, her &s;i&s;ters, a numerous family, her fortune, her coun|try, her religion&mdash;all the&s;e &s;he for&s;ook, and fled with me to our Albion coa&s;t. Indi&s;cretion and misfortunes have robbed me of every penny which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. I have no means of obtaining the common nece&s;&s;aries of life; the few articles of which I have not yet di&s;|po&s;ed, will not di&s;charge the debts already contracted. Tho&s;e flatterers, who ba&s;ked in the &s;un&s;hine of my for|tune, have now utterly for&s;aken me. My wife, my beloved wife, and her helple&s;s children, are reduced to the la&s;t extremity. I have left no means una&s;&s;ayed, by which I could pre&s;ume upon relief; but every effort hath proved ineffectual, and I have now quitted my Almira, with an expre&s;&s;ed hope, for which, alas! there is no foundation. She will expect me with the return|ing &s;un; but &s;he will no more behold me. I can no longer exi&s;t a witne&s;s of tho&s;e ills, of which I have been the wretched cau&s;e!" Need I add, that I was eager to &s;peak, to this &s;on of &s;orrow, the words of con&s;ola|tion? Con&s;idering my&s;elf as the banker of the unfor|tunate, his draught upon me was indi&s;putable; and the rays of night's fair empre&s;s, lent a light &s;ufficiently &s;trong, to evince the authenticity of its characters.</P>
<P>I accompanied my new claimant, now incredulous, and now frantic with joy to his dwelling. I had de|termined
<PB N="298" REF="034162_0297_0FFC646C828DD6D0">
to keep guard the remainder of the night. We entered &s;oftly. His little family had retired to re&s;t. I in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould in&s;tantly &s;peak peace to his beloved. I in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould not revi&s;it the par|lour, until the ri&s;ing &s;un &s;hould enable me to commence my propo&s;ed arrangements. I will repo&s;e, &s;aid I, in this ea&s;y chair; or here are books, with which I may a|mu&s;e my&s;elf. Awed by that tone of authority which I had a&s;&s;umed, with looks of a&s;toni&s;hment, and the mo&s;t profound obei&s;ance, he left me; and &s;leep being beyond my reach, I endeavoured to obtain &s;ufficient compo&s;ure to amu&s;e my&s;elf by reading. I turned over the books&mdash;it would not do. A new and painful kind of agitation hurried my &s;pirits; at length a parcel of Magazines &s;eized my attention. I glanced confu|&s;edly upon the bundle. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Magazine caught my eye&mdash;<HI>an American production</HI>&mdash;curio&s;ity was enli&s;ted; I opened one and another; an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e &s;till urged me on; the fir&s;t page of the Mag|azine for March, 1792, arre&s;ted my ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;"<HI>Ble&s;s me, cried Margaretta,</HI>"&mdash;you will recollect, Sir, that you thus commenced the enchanting narrative.</P>
<P>The appellation <HI>Margaretta</HI> vibrated intere&s;tingly upon my ear; it was the &s;weet tali&s;man of a thou&s;and mingling &s;en&s;ations; no power on earth could have prevented my reading on. I accompanied you in your journey to South-Carolina, and I entered with you the city of Charle&s;ton. The little Margaretta's tap at the door po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fa&s;cinating power&mdash;the in|troduction of the lovely cherub penetrated my very &s;oul; I waited impatiently for the i&s;&s;ue; I attended at the bed of death&mdash;but, great and good God! what were my &s;en&s;ations when I heard from the lips of Mrs. Arbuthnot, the well known &s;tory of my Marga|retta's &s;ufferings&mdash;when I learned that the dear pledge of our &s;acred loves was yet alive! when I recognized her in the per&s;on of the little petitioner&mdash;when I be|came a&s;&s;ured that &s;he had been received by &s;uch pro|tectors! I &s;hrieked aloud, wrung my hands, wept, laughed, pro&s;trated my&s;elf in adoration of a pre&s;erving

God&mdash;traver&s;ed up and down the apartment, until, at length impelled by perturbed anxiety, I was con&s;train|ed to trace my daughter's wondrous fortune through the various Magazines, which, until the clo&s;e of the month of November la&s;t, pre&s;ented them&s;elves in or|der before me. How did my full &s;oul ble&s;s her god|li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e benefactors! During the connexion with Court|land, the mo&s;t tumultuous agitations tempe&s;ted my bo&s;om; but the cata&s;trophe, I conceived, gave her honoured guardians a title to almo&s;t divine honours. Again I became a prey to all tho&s;e agonizing fears which can lacerate a father's heart. Even of Mi&s;s Clifford, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I was not a little &s;u&s;pi|cious. My feelings again&s;t thee, my &s;on, were replete with indignation; and I be&s;towed upon thy &s;uppo&s;ed incon&s;tancy a parent's malediction. But November pre&s;ented the extatic eclairci&s;&s;ement. I &s;aw that nothing was wanting, but what I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed abundant ability to &s;upply; and, in broken and almo&s;t frantic ejaculations, I &s;obbed out my gratitude. The dawn at length broke. Memorable, ever memorable night! Never, never can I be forgetful of the events which thou produced!</P>
<P>An early hour pre&s;ented the now not de&s;pairing Altamont. He led his Almira by the hand. I had cautioned him not to &s;hock the delicacy of her feel|ings, by a recital of the extremity to which he had been precipitated; and he had been di&s;creet enough to follow my advice. He had &s;imply informed her that Heaven had &s;ent him a friend, and this informa|tion had proved &s;ufficient to excite the mo&s;t lively emo|tions. Altamont began a &s;peech expre&s;&s;ive of his gratitude; but I cut him &s;hort, by deci&s;ively pronoun|cing, that fate had ordained me eternally his debtor. My di&s;ordered countenance, and the energy of my manner, alarmed him; and he in his turn became doubtful of <HI>my</HI> rea&s;on. I gave him, however, a &s;im|ple relation of facts. I held up the divine pages. Had I not met thee; had I not con&s;ented to deliver to thee that dividend of our common Father's intere&s;t, with
<PB N="300" REF="034162_0299_0FFC68F29C822FF0">
which he has entru&s;ted me for thy behoof, I had not met the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed records; I had not received intelli|gence, which hath communicated to my &s;oul immea&s;|urable felicity. <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> amply hath our God rewarded me for de&s;igning an act of common ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>Grateful tears of rapture, it will not be doubt|ed, we mingled. Every thing was &s;peedily adju&s;ted to the complete &s;atisfaction of Altamont and his Al|mira. With the fir&s;t &s;hip, I embarked for America. The name of Colonel Worthington, of New-Haven, was my clue; and I bore with me the heaven in&s;pired Magazines. From Colonel Worthington I learned every nece&s;&s;ary particular. I was told, my &s;on, of your intended voyage, of the con&s;equent angui&s;h of my daughter's &s;oul. I ble&s;s God that I am in time to prevent its pro&s;ecution. Every individual &s;hall re|ceive his dues; that good young man, your <HI>forbearing friend,</HI> the benevolent Seymour&mdash;every one &s;hall be happy!</P></Q>
<P>Unwilling to leave the curio&s;ity of the reader un|gratified, during the tardy revolution of another month, I have felt my&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to curtail the narrative of Mr. Melworth. Many u&s;eful ob&s;erva|tions are omitted. The frequent interruption, breaks, and pau&s;es, occa&s;ioned by the &s;u&s;ceptibility of Mrs. Hamilton, and the agitation of her father; the unbounded and venerating gratitude of Edward; and the combining admiration, and rapt felicity of our whole party; all this was in cour&s;e, and to every thing of this &s;ort, I mu&s;t repeat, that the &s;ilently expre&s;&s;ive touches of that vivid pencil, which is found in the glowing hand of fancy, can alone do ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Already our young people have re&s;umed their ele|gant family &s;eat. Mi&s;s Clifford is &s;till the companion of Margaretta. Amelia Worthington is now a congrat|ulating vi&s;itor at Hamilton-Place. Mr. Melworth is for the pre&s;ent a re&s;ident in that &s;weetly romantic man|&s;ion; and this very morning, the &s;econd day of July, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-four, witne&s;|&s;ing the birth of a daughter to Margaretta, hath &s;eem|ed to complete our family felicity.</P>

<P>THE multifarious ligaments which bind fam|ilies together, being the handy-work of na|ture, and e&s;&s;entially or clo&s;ely interwoven with our exi&s;tence, that &s;hock mu&s;t be indeed violent, that can bur&s;t them a&s;under. It is true that a long continued &s;eries of di&s;obligation may ob&s;cure the vivid glow of tho&s;e images, which nature and habit have impre&s;&s;ed upon the intellect. Unkindne&s;s is the opaque body, which intercepts the &s;unny beams of luminous and in|born tenderne&s;s; but the eclip&s;e is &s;eldom total, and the cheering influence of affection is frequently invig|orated, and often becomes the more tran&s;cendent, for the momentary ob&s;truction, by which it &s;eemed well near enveloped.</P>
<P>Surely that heart mu&s;t be &s;trangely deficient, which the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations that are attendant upon the fir&s;t &s;tage of being, hath not indelibly impre&s;&s;ed; and, that mind is unwarrantably implacable, which, intrenched by inexorable inflexibility, is incapable of being rou&s;ed to the tenderne&s;s of recollection; which is not &s;oftened by the remon&s;trances of nature, fur|ni&s;hed with arguments, drawn from a &s;eries of endear|ing and &s;ub&s;tantially beneficial proofs, of a generous attachment. Yet I know there are a variety of com|bu&s;tibles, which although perhaps not radically natives of the human &s;oil, having, however, obtained a growth therein, and once taking fire, it is difficult to &s;ay where the conflagration may end. I am aware there are in|juries which pride and &s;elf e&s;timation, con&s;ider as un|pardonable. It is a melancholy truth there are ob|durate hearts; and, it may be, that the &s;trong winds
<PB N="302" REF="034162_0301_0FFC68EFDA8F3D78">
of pa&s;&s;ion may obliterate, or uproot from the bo|&s;om every proper &s;en&s;ation of the &s;oul. But grant|ing that the empoi&s;oned plant may become rampant in the rancorous brea&s;t, the Gleaner, while engaged in the routine of his profe&s;&s;ion, hath at no moment bound him&s;elf to &s;elect the noxious weed; he confe&s;&s;es he is fond of culling the flowers of humanity, and that, with the&s;e, as often as may be, he is &s;olicitous to furni&s;h and adorn his page.</P>
<P>To the well regulated mind, the contemplation of family harmony is inexpre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ing. The phi|lanthropic &s;peculator views the little &s;ociety unaltera|bly attached, bound together by the &s;trong cords of mutual affection, and ri&s;ing &s;uperior to the adver&s;e in|fluence of &s;eparate or &s;elfi&s;h claims, as a miniature of that va&s;t family of man, which futurity &s;hall &s;ee col|lected under the protecting au&s;pices of a benign and paternal God. Order, unbroken confidence, cele&s;tial tenderne&s;s, energetic love&mdash;in this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, the&s;e &s;hall all triumphantly officiate. Peaceful an|gels &s;hall hover round; di&s;cord &s;hall find no entrance there; offences &s;hall be no more; but truth, &s;ky ro|bed innocence, unimpeached integrity, unblemi&s;hed virtue, and undeviating holine&s;s, &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed, <HI>from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting, and of their dominion there &s;hall be no end.</HI> Yes, it is plea&s;ing to trace the &s;trik|ing re&s;emblance which is exemplified in the animated &s;ketch. Mild, affectionate and <HI>judiciou&s;ly</HI> indulgent parents; duteous and confiding &s;ons and daughters; mutually complacent, and unequivocally attached brothers and &s;i&s;ters. The royal bard of I&s;rael, &s;triking|ly, feelingly, and poetically delineates the family of love: "<HI>Behold how good, and how plea&s;ant it is for breth|ren to dwell together in unity.</HI>" Well might the &s;acred poet &s;ummon the aid of a &s;plendid fancy, and arre&s;t the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive figures to image the fine effects and plea&s;ing utility of dome&s;tic complacency; the rich perfumes which con&s;ecrated the anointed prie&s;t of the Hebrew tribes, the fertilizing dew de&s;cending up|on Hermon's verdant &s;ummit, and re&s;ting with ge|nial

influence upon the adjacent eminence; the&s;e but &s;hadow forth the &s;ublimity of that union, upon which our God hath commanded a ble&s;&s;ing, which originates a dignified and bli&s;sful immortality.</P>
<P>Yes, it is plea&s;ing to trace the &s;triking re&s;emblance which is exemplified in the animated &s;ketch. The contemplation of dome&s;tic harmony &s;oothes and ele|vates the mind, and although it is undeniably true, that the philo&s;opher will extend his regards from the little group which con&s;titutes his <HI>relative circle, to friends, to country, to the univer&s;e at large, until he commences a citizen of the domain of heaven;</HI> yet he will not refu&s;e to acknowledge tho&s;e ardors, tho&s;e hopes, and tho&s;e fears, which upon his opening mind, in the white winged hours that marked his dawn of being, were, by the &s;trong hand of nature, irrever&s;ibly engraved.</P>
<P>Affection is very properly &s;aid to de&s;cend; and it is generally true, that while we venerate with pious duty the authors of our being, while our hearts are warm|ed for them by love and reverence, we are in the &s;ame moment impelled to acknowledge for our offspring, augmented and more energetic tenderne&s;s. Nature, it is &s;aid, hath implanted the&s;e &s;uperior and irre&s;i&s;ti|ble &s;en&s;ations, for the purpo&s;e of nerving our efforts for the pre&s;ervation and advancement of the infant candidate; but, be this as it may, in whatever wi&s;e regulations it hath originated, the fact is indubitable. Family ties of every de&s;cription are variou&s;ly re&s;pect|able, and variou&s;ly e&s;timable, in their various depart|ments: I have been lately led to an appreciation of their comparative value by a di&s;qui&s;ition on which I was a &s;ilent attendant, that aimed at deciding what relative character de&s;erved the preference. The inve&s;ti|gation was rather curious than important; but it &s;erv|ed, however, to amu&s;e, during a vacant hour, which might have been wor&s;e appropriated.</P>
<P>The attachment of a well informed and tender fa|ther, to an amiable and grateful daughter, has been &s;aid to re&s;emble that which is experienced by a guar|dian angel, to the being who is committed to his charge
<PB N="304" REF="034162_0303_0FFC68EA1AAB4D10">
&mdash;tender, delicate, and dive&s;ted of all that can deba&s;e, the paternal eye regards with immea&s;urable com|placency, his beauteous, his dependent child; and the fine&s;t feelings of his &s;oul become embodied. To pro|tect her from every ill he is &s;edulou&s;ly attentive; his judicious cautions hover round her inexperienced &s;teps; his protecting arm would pre&s;ent the invulnerable &s;hield; and his au&s;pices are tho&s;e of wi&s;dom. Ever vigilant, ever upon his guard, to &s;ave her, even from the imputation of di&s;honour, he would con&s;ider his life as a comparatively trivial &s;acrifice. It is true that he is impa&s;&s;ioned, but his ardours are tho&s;e of virtue; his affections are pure, innocent, laudable, elevated, and refined; and, originating in nature, orig|inating in God, they will be perfected in heaven. All this is irrefragably ju&s;t, and yet I take leave to ob|&s;erve, that the <HI>fraternal</HI> department, when filled by a good and virtuous mind, more exactly an&s;wers the ideas which I have indulged, of that attendant cher|ub, ordained to tread with holy vigils, the de&s;tined path of the expecting voyager. In contemplating the character of a father, however beneficial its offices, we can hardly forbear recollecting, that, having pro|duced the being which is cheri&s;hed, the con&s;equent at|tachment may be the re&s;ult of that <HI>&s;elfi&s;h principle</HI> which &s;o univer&s;ally, more or le&s;s, actuates the human mind; and, it is undeniably true, that the operation of a <HI>&s;elfi&s;h principle</HI> e&s;&s;entially dimini&s;hes the lu&s;tre of the mo&s;t beneficial and exemplary action.</P>
<P>A brother, it hath been divinely ob&s;erved, is born for adver&s;ity; a gentle and confiding female can hard|ly boa&s;t a more agreeable or <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> relation; the general arrangements of nature authorizes a hope, that his protection will continue coeval with her mor|tal career, and if he fulfils the duties of the fraternal name, he will &s;till continue a natural, patronizing, and con&s;olatory re&s;ource. What eye is not charmed by a view of the marked and delicate attention, which is paid by an elegant young man to the gentle and ac|compli&s;hed maiden, who is the daughter of his father
<PB N="305" REF="034162_0304_0FFC68E88559CBF8">
and of his mother. Grant that opportunities of this kind are extremely rare, the &s;en&s;ations derived there|from are, neverthele&s;s, in a &s;uperior degree, plea&s;ing. The attachment of a brother to a &s;i&s;ter, if it is genu|ine and &s;incere, if it corre&s;ponds with the de&s;ignation of unadulterated and upright nature, partakes the ex|qui&s;ite delicacies and refinements of love, devoid of its tumultuous caprices, or intere&s;ted and ungovernable fervors; with ineffable &s;atisfaction it yields that pro|tection, to which nature and education combine to give the &s;ex a claim. It is not &s;tinted in its regards; it is tender, elevated and refined; it is generous and com|municable; it is &s;ympathetic and permanent. A true brother unites the duties of the <HI>paternal,</HI> with the more equal, &s;weet, and &s;ocial plea&s;ures of the <HI>fraternal</HI> in|tercour&s;e; the heart of a brother he&s;itates not to ac|knowledge the bland, endearing, and indi&s;&s;oluble ties of amity. A true brother is at all times a guardian friend; he rejoiceth in his fraternity; and, I repeat, that his attachment may claim kindred with tho&s;e &s;en|timents, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to actuate the tenderly watchful &s;eraph, who, commi&s;&s;ioned by the high court of Heaven, enters with the fir&s;t moment of our exi&s;t|ence upon his tru&s;t, and fulfils his cele&s;tial mi&s;&s;ion, by attending through every &s;tage of life his progre&s;&s;ing charge.</P>
<P>Richard&s;on exhibits the character, proper to a Broth|er, in the mo&s;t vivid and glowing hues; but if his Grandi&s;on originated not in fiction, the portrait doubt|le&s;s owes many embelli&s;hments to the incomparable pen of that inimitable writer. It is a melancholy fact, that eminent virtue, of whatever de&s;cription, is a gem that the hand of nature, however indulgent, hath too &s;eldom produced. Yet, for the honour of humanity, I cannot deny my&s;elf the gratification of affirming that I, at this moment, contemplate <HI>more than one brother</HI> who hath uniformly &s;upported that endearing character.

Much do I regret that I am not authorized to name tho&s;e fair examples, which, through a cour&s;e of years, I have been accu&s;tomed to admire. But the emblaz|oning voice of fame might po&s;&s;ibly tinge their cheeks with the hue of di&s;approbation; for it is certainly true, that genuine merit "<HI>Does good by &s;tealth, and blu&s;hing finds it fame.</HI>" Yet, if, while &s;ketching the outlines of characters &s;o replete with excellence, their celebrity &s;hould induce the finger of perception to point out the living portraits, the Gleaner pre&s;umes he ought not to be made re&s;pon&s;ible for con&s;equences which, by the foreign traits wherewith he hath &s;tudiou&s;ly diver&s;ified his de&s;criptions, he hath been &s;olicitous to avoid. It is indubitably an exalted and &s;ublime kind of plea&s;ure which we derive from a view of tran&s;cendent worth; and that writer &s;hould at lea&s;t be con&s;idered as venial, who, fond of contributing to enjoyments re&s;ulting from an unexceptionable &s;ource, is careful to collect in&s;tances which adorn and elevate his &s;pecies. A laudable mo|tive is ju&s;tly admitted as an advocate for the propriety of an action. If it i&s;&s;ues pure from the fountain of rectitude, we are not, I have conceived, to be regarded as re&s;pon&s;ible, for the adventitious mixtures which it may connect, as it winds its cour&s;e through the murky grounds of opinion, malevolence, mi&s;conception or de|traction. But, be this as it may, the reflections to which this e&s;&s;ay owes its being, have originated in a view of <HI>real life;</HI> and the probability is, that if virtu|ous, informed and judicious parents were multiplied among us, family attachment would be continued, and individuals, branching out in their &s;everal directions, would &s;till, however, reverting to their ancient &s;tock, continue encircled by the bonds of amity. <HI>Character</HI> may &s;ome time pre&s;erve its a&s;cendency over <HI>education;</HI> but education will, neverthele&s;s, remain a powerful agent in the formation both of the heart and the man|ners; and ob&s;ervation convinces us, if the <HI>principals</HI> exhibit the <HI>pattern,</HI> the family will generally be en|dowed with the <HI>virtues,</HI> the <HI>graces,</HI> and the <HI>elegance of humanity.</HI></P>

In the families of &s;uch parents, <HI>regularity</HI> pre|&s;ides. The morning is u&s;hered in by the devout breathings of cheerful and &s;olemnized &s;pirits, and the return of "<HI>&s;ober &s;uited evening,</HI>" witne&s;&s;eth their grate|ful and pious ori&s;ons. The various duties of humanity are punctually di&s;charged, and the hours of lei&s;ure are uniformly devoted to the cultivation of the minds of tho&s;e children, whom they de&s;ign as <HI>natural friends to each other,</HI> and as u&s;eful and ornamental members of the <HI>community</HI> to which they appertain.</P>
<P>It was from &s;uch a &s;tock that the venerable and truly re&s;pectable Horten&s;ius de&s;cended; and, having marked with uncommon &s;atisfaction the &s;erene plea&s;|ures which gild the evening of his days, we wave the privilege of a noveli&s;t, who&s;e character places in his gift a choice of heroes, and hazard the mentioning a character, the original of which, having continued through revolving years the boa&s;t of fraternal records, may perhaps immediately occur to the reader, who is at all conver&s;ant in the li&s;t of tho&s;e worthies, that in our Columbian world have given &s;plendor to the pre&s;|ent day.</P>
<P>Horten&s;ius was bred to bu&s;ine&s;s, and his probity through all the complicated &s;cenes in which he hath been engaged hath remained unimpeached. Frugali|ty and indu&s;try are con&s;iderable traits in his charac|ter; his efforts are crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, and he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of affluence. A &s;evere di&s;appointment in early life, relative to the maiden of his election, &s;teel|ed his heart again&s;t every &s;ub&s;equent approach of the tender pa&s;&s;ion, and ambitious of the title, <HI>Citizen of the World,</HI> he devoted him&s;elf to a &s;eries of beneficent ac|tions, con&s;ulting in every movement the felicity of the family of man.</P>
<P>Horten&s;ius was exemplary as a &s;on, and it was one of his principal enjoyments, "<HI>to rock the cradle of declining
<PB N="309" REF="034162_0308_0FFC68DD2B6DC470">
age;</HI>" his parents continued in life to extreme old age, and after gently &s;loping for them their pa&s;&s;age out of time, he laid them decently in the earth, bedewing their exit with a manly and a filial tear. In the me|tropolis, where he was u&s;hered into being, he hath &s;u&s;tained through &s;ucceeding years, and with unblem|i&s;hed reputation, the office of an upright and impor|tant magi&s;trate, and he is beloved and re&s;pected as univer&s;ally as he is known. Horten&s;ius is learned, re|ligious and cheerful, and his liberality is only circum|&s;cribed by his abilities. But if you would give the fini&s;hing touches to the character of Horten&s;ius, you mu&s;t borrow the pen of his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>This amiable woman, although accu&s;tomed to his benignity, can hardly mention him, e&s;pecially if you advert to his benevolence, without tears. To the nu|merous family, of which he is the head, he at once di&s;charges the duties of a parent, and a brother; but, by her, he is con&s;idered as meriting epithets more ten|der, more re&s;pectful, and more expre&s;&s;ive than language hath yet fa&s;hioned; and her tongue untired, delights to expatiate upon his many virtues. She was in the bloom of life widowed of her deare&s;t hopes, and the hour which marked the exit of him, with whom &s;he had exchanged her youthful vows, who had been the deliberate choice both of affection and of judgment, and to whom &s;he was devoted by every motive which can endear a bo&s;om friend, that fatal hour yielded her a monument of woe! while the virtues of her lo&s;t companion, &s;eemed amply to ju&s;tify tho&s;e demon&s;tra|tions of heart-felt angui&s;h, which, notwith&s;tanding the length of years that have &s;ince elap&s;ed, &s;he &s;till occa|&s;ionally indulges. A number of infant &s;ons and daughters, incapable of e&s;timating the amount of their deprivation, while they augmented her grief, armed her with re&s;olution to attempt encountering the ills of life. Yet, de&s;titute of property, (for a train of pe|cuniary misfortunes had preceded the demi&s;e of the father of her children) unaccu&s;tomed to any ardu|ous effort, and rendered imbecile by &s;orrow, the prob|ability
<PB N="310" REF="034162_0309_0FFC68D73A17E708">
is, &s;he mu&s;t have &s;unk under the pre&s;&s;ure of calamity.</P>
<P>But Horten&s;ius &s;aw, he pitied, and he flew to re&s;|cue. A commodious and elegant habitation was pre|pared; his &s;i&s;ter and her little family were put into immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof; and, taking apartments for him&s;elf under the &s;ame roof, he became her &s;olace, her companion, and her protector; and he was, at once, the guardian, the &s;upport, and the preceptor of her children. Their education has been the mo&s;t lib|eral which our country can afford; her elde&s;t &s;on is now a barri&s;ter of di&s;tingui&s;hed eminence; her daugh|ters are apportioned and married into the genteele&s;t families, and they are con&s;idered as ornaments of their &s;ex; while the glad emotions of their grateful hearts unre&s;ervedly hail the good Horten&s;ius as their father and their friend; and they equitably acknowledge higher obligations to him, than they could have owed to the author of their beings, who&s;e indi&s;pen&s;able duty it would have been, to have reared and cheri&s;hed them.</P>
<P>A view of Horten&s;ius, placed in the mid&s;t of the charming group, is gratifying to the be&s;t feelings of the heart; he experiences the rapture of a parent, while the children of his affectionate bounty, attached by affinity, gratitude, love, and veneration, behold him as a guardian &s;eraph, clothed in the habiliments of humanity, by that watchful Providence, who de|&s;igned him their benefactor, their guide, and their truly munificent re&s;ource! Doubtle&s;s, the fir&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings will be found in his train. Nay, he is already in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of that "<HI>&s;weet peace of mind, which goodne&s;s bo|&s;oms ever.</HI>"</P>

<P>NO&mdash;Athei&s;m will never do. The prime procurer and mini&s;ter of the French arrangements, at length accedes to this axiom; and Gallia, having guil|lotined her &s;overeign, and bla&s;phemou&s;ly &s;ought to dethrone and annihilate the Monarch of Heaven, be|comes, in her pre&s;ent re&s;olutions, &s;olicitous to re-e&s;tab|li&s;h the Deity in her &s;y&s;tems, to inve&s;t the Supreme with tho&s;e divine honours, which the language of na|ture ha&s;teth to be&s;tow, which the dictates of rea&s;on in|variably award.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ed, from principle, to tho&s;e &s;anguinary decrees, which, pronouncing the death-warrant of whole heca|tombs of my &s;pecies, fail not to let loo&s;e the dogs of war, I will confe&s;s, that I have not felt for the name of Robe&s;pierre any of tho&s;e cordialities which con&s;ti|tute the aggregate of amity. The anarchy and con|&s;equent enormities, prevalent in France, together with tho&s;e licentious principles, which have apparently been &s;o generally embraced, I have con&s;idered as replete with incalculable evils, as the baleful precur&s;ors of ev|ery ill which can afflict humanity! Such my &s;enti|ments, I expected not from the report of Robe&s;pierre, tho&s;e &s;trong and glowing &s;en&s;ations, which, whenever I attend to the voice of truth, mo&s;t delightfully expand my &s;oul&mdash;But I have read&mdash;and, charmed with the prevalent contour of the compo&s;ition, the energy and beauty of the diction, and the demon&s;trative propriety

and &s;ublimity of the ob&s;ervations&mdash;while I do homage to the tran&s;lator, I cannot but join my &s;uffrage to tho&s;e applau&s;es, by which America has marked the <HI>new-born</HI> piety of the French politician.</P>
<P>It is true that, as being a member of the prote&s;tant community, I am nece&s;&s;itated, by my creed, to re|nounce all &s;upplications made to &s;aints, whatever eclat may have attended their canonization. I may not feel at liberty to cry out, "Oh! <HI>Sancta Robe&s;pierre, ora pro nobis;</HI>" yet if he, <HI>in reality,</HI> &s;hall at length pur&s;ue the <HI>mild dictates</HI> of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> every &s;enti|ment of my &s;oul will combine to wi&s;h him God &s;peed. An admirer of the report in the gro&s;s, I yet conceive that the following extracts can hardly be too often repeated, can &s;carcely be too &s;trongly inculcated, or too deeply engraven upon the tablets of reflection. "What was the wi&s;h of tho&s;e, who, in the bo&s;om of the con&s;piracies with which we were &s;urrounded, in the mid&s;t of the embarra&s;&s;ments of &s;uch a war, at the moment while the torch of civil di&s;cord was &s;till &s;mok|ing, &s;uddenly attacked all kinds of wor&s;hip by violence, to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves as the furious apo&s;tles of anni|hilation, and as the fanatic mi&s;&s;ionaries of athei&s;m? Attend only to the happine&s;s of your country and the intere&s;ts of humanity; <HI>cheri&s;h all opinions and in&s;titu|tions which con&s;ole and elevate the mind;</HI> reject tho&s;e which tend to degrade and corrupt them; <HI>revive</HI> and exalt all tho&s;e generous &s;entiments and tho&s;e great moral ideas which they have wi&s;hed to extingui&s;h; <HI>reconcile by the charms of friend&s;hip, and the bonds of virtue, tho&s;e citizens whom they have wi&s;hed to divide. Who has given thee the mi&s;&s;ion of announcing to the peo|ple, that the Deity does not exi&s;t?</HI> To you who are at|tached to this barren doctrine, and who are not ani|mated in the cau&s;e of your country, <HI>what advantage do you derive</HI> from <HI>per&s;uading man that a blind force pre&s;ides in his de&s;tiny, and &s;trikes by chance his virtues or his vices; and that his &s;oul is only a tran&s;ient breath which is extin|gui&s;hed at the tomb? Will the idea of his annihilation in&s;pire him with more pure or more elevated &s;entiments than that
<PB N="313" REF="034162_0312_0FFC68D0624A6588">
of his immortality?</HI> Will it in&s;pire him with more re|&s;pect for his fellow men, or for him&s;elf; more attach|ment to his country; more firmne&s;s in braving tyran|ny; more <HI>contempt for death</HI> or plea&s;ure? <HI>You who re|gret a virtuous friend, do you not delight to reflect that the mo&s;t valuable part of him has e&s;caped decea&s;e?</HI> You who weep over the corp&s;e of a &s;on or a wife, <HI>are you con&s;ol|ed by him who tells you that nothing more of them remains than a vile heap of du&s;t?</HI> Unfortunate men, who expire under the &s;troke of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in! your la&s;t &s;igh is an appeal to eternal ju&s;tice! Innocence, on the &s;caffold, makes the tyrant turn pale in his triumphal car: Would it have this a&s;cendency if the tomb put upon a level the oppre&s;&s;or and the oppre&s;&s;ed? Mi&s;erable &s;ophi&s;t! from whence do you derive this right of rending from in|nocence the &s;ceptre of rea&s;on, and of placing it again in the hands of vice; <HI>to throw a melancholy veil over na|ture, to drive misfortune to de&s;pair;</HI> to encourage vice, to afflict virtue, to degrade humanity? <HI>The more a man is endowed with &s;en&s;ibility and genius, the more is he at|tached to tho&s;e ideas which aggrandize his being, and which elevate his mind; and the doctrine of men of this character &s;hould become that of the univer&s;e.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Ah! how can tho&s;e ideas differ from truth? At lea&s;t I cannot conceive how nature could have &s;ug|ge&s;ted to man any <HI>fictions</HI> more u&s;eful than the&s;e <HI>real|ities;</HI> and if the exi&s;tence of a God, if the immortality of the &s;oul, were only dreams, they would &s;till remain the mo&s;t &s;plendid of all the conceptions of the human mind.</P>
<P>The idea of the Supreme Being, and the immortal|ity of the &s;oul, is a continual invitation to ju&s;tice: It is then &s;ocial and republican. He who can replace the Deity in the &s;y&s;tem of &s;ocial life, is, in my opinion, a prodigy of genius; and he, who without having re|placed him, only endeavours to bani&s;h him from the mind of man, appears to me a prodigy of &s;tupidity or perver&s;ity. If the principles I have hitherto develop|ed are errors, I am deceived in what the world unite to revere. Ob&s;erve with what art Ce&s;ar, pleading in

the Roman &s;enate in favour of the accomplices of Cataline, lo&s;t him&s;elf in digre&s;&s;ion again&s;t the doctrine of the immortality of the &s;oul; &s;o well calculated did the&s;e ideas appear to him, to di&s;tingui&s;h in the hearts of the judges the energy of virtue; &s;o clo&s;ely did the cau&s;e of vice appear to him, connected with that of Athei&s;m. Cicero, on the contrary invoked again&s;t the traitors both the &s;word of the law and the thunder of the gods. Socrates, when dying, conver&s;ed with his friends on the immortality of the &s;oul. Leonidas, at Thermopyles, &s;upping with his companions in arms, at the moment of executing the mo&s;t heroic de&s;ign that human virtue ever conceived, invited them for the next day to another banquet in a new life.</P>
<P>A great man, a real hero, e&s;teems him&s;elf too much to be plea&s;ed with the idea of his annihilation. A vil|lain, contemptible in his own eyes, and horrible in tho&s;e of other men, perceives that nature cannot afford him a more &s;plendid boon than that of his annihilation. Religion collects mankind together, and by collecting them together you will render them better; for when men are thus a&s;&s;embled, they endeavour to plea&s;e each other, which can only be effected by tho&s;e things that render them e&s;timable. Give to their reunion a great moral and political motive, and the love of virtuous things will, with plea&s;ure, enter their hearts; for man|kind do not &s;ee each other without plea&s;ure.</P></Q>
<P>I had but recently peru&s;ed the whole of this very excellent moral report, when one of the be&s;t informed, and mo&s;t &s;entimental of my friends, put into my hands a piece &s;elected from the London Morning Chronicle of November 29, 1793.</P>
<P>To the matured judgment of this friend I am in the habit of paying high deference; and he conceived, that whether we regarded the little narration as a fact, or an ingenious reproof of the conduct of the predomi|nant party in France, it contained a &s;ufficient quantum of good &s;en&s;e to merit pre&s;ervation. It is a proper &s;upplement for the celebrated report of Robe&s;pierre, and in my office of caterer for my readers, perhaps I
<PB N="315" REF="034162_0314_0FFC68CBB4A631F8">
could not do better than to offer it to their acceptance. I &s;ubjoin it, therefore, with an added with, that it may contribute as largely to their plea&s;ures, as it did to the &s;atisfaction of the Gleaner.</P>
<P>"A few days after the bi&s;hop of Paris and his vi|cars had &s;et the example of renouncing their clerical character, a curi from a village on the banks of the Rhone, followed by &s;ome of his pari&s;hioners, with an offering of gold, &s;ilver, &s;aints' chalices, rich ve&s;tments, &amp;c. pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the bar of the hou&s;e. The &s;ight of the gold put the Convention in very good hu|mour, and the curi, a thin venerable looking man, with grey hair, was ordered to &s;peak. I came, &s;aid he, from the village of&mdash;, where the only good building &s;tanding (for the chatteau has been pulled down) is a very fine church; my pari&s;hioners beg you will take it to make a ho&s;pital for the &s;ick and wound|ed of both parties, they being equally our countrymen; the gold and &s;ilver, part of which we have brought you, they entreat you will devote to the &s;ervice of the State; and that you will ca&s;t the bells into cannon, to drive away its foreign invaders. For my&s;elf I am come with great plea&s;ure to re&s;ign my letters of ordination, of induction, and every deed of title, by which I have been con&s;tituted a member of your eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity. I am &s;till able to &s;upport my&s;elf with the labour of my hands, and I beg you to believe that I never felt &s;in|cerer joy than I now do in making this renunciation&mdash;I have longed to &s;ee this day; I &s;ee it, and am glad."</P>
<Q><P>When the old man had done &s;peaking, the ap|plau&s;es were immoderate. You are an hone&s;t man, &s;aid they all at once; a brave fellow, you do not be|lieve in God; and the Pre&s;ident advanced to give him the fraternal embrace. The curi did not &s;eem greatly elated with the&s;e tokens of approbation; he retired back a few &s;teps, and thus re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e:</P>
<P>Before you applaud my &s;entiments, it is fit you un|der&s;tand them; perhaps they may not entirely coincide with your own. I rejoice in this day, not becau&s;e I wi&s;h to &s;ee religion degraded, but becau&s;e I wi&s;h to &s;ee
<PB N="316" REF="034162_0315_0FFC68C9F6D75E20">
it exalted and purified. By di&s;&s;olving its alliance with the State, you give it dignity and independence; you have done it a piece of &s;ervice which its well-wi&s;hers would never have had courage to render it, but which is the only thing wanted to make it appear in its gen|uine lu&s;tre and beauty. Nobody will now &s;ay of me, when I am performing the offices of my religion&mdash;It is his trade&mdash;he is paid for telling the people &s;uch and &s;uch things&mdash;he is hired to keep up a u&s;eful piece of mummery. They cannot now &s;ay this; and therefore I feel my&s;elf rai&s;ed in my own e&s;teem, and &s;hall &s;peak to them with a confidence and frankne&s;s, which before this I never dur&s;t venture to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>We re&s;ign, without reluctance, our gold and &s;ilver images and embroidered ve&s;tments, becau&s;e that we have never &s;ound, that looking upon gold or &s;ilver made the heart more pure, or the affections more heavenly: We can al&s;o &s;pare our churches; for the heart that wi&s;hes to lift it&s;elf up to God, will never be at a lo&s;s for room to do it in;&mdash;but we cannot &s;pare our religion, becau&s;e, to tell you the truth, we never had &s;o much occa&s;ion for it. I under&s;tand that you accu&s;e us prie&s;ts of having told the people a great many falsehoods. I &s;uppo&s;e this may have been the ca&s;e; but till this day we have never been allowed to inquire, whether the things which we taught them were true or not. You required us formerly to receive them all without proof, and you now would have us reject them all without di&s;crimination. Neither of the&s;e modes of conduct become philo&s;ophers, &s;uch as you would be thought to be. I am going to employ my&s;elf diligently, along with my pari&s;hioners, to &s;ift the wheat from the bran, the true from the fal&s;e: If we are not &s;ucce&s;sful, we &s;hall be at lea&s;t &s;incere.</P>
<P>I do fear, indeed, that while I wore tho&s;e ve&s;tments which we have brought you, and &s;poke in the large gloomy building which we have given up to you, I told my poor flock many idle &s;tories. I cannot but hope, however, that the errors we have fallen into have not been very material, &s;ince the village has in
<PB N="317" REF="034162_0316_0FFC68C6F095CA38">
general been &s;ober and good; the pea&s;ants are hone&s;t, docile, and laborious; the hu&s;bands love their wives, and the wives their hu&s;bands; they are fortunately not too rich to be compa&s;&s;ionate, and they have con|&s;tantly relieved the &s;ick and fugitives of all parties, whenever it has lain in their way. I think, therefore, what I have taught them cannot be &s;o very much ami&s;s. You want to extirpate prie&s;ts; but will you hinder the ignorant from applying for in&s;truction, the unhappy for comfort and hope, the unlearned from looking up to the learned? If you do not, you will have prie&s;ts, by whatever name you will order them to be called; but it is certainly not nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould wear a particular dre&s;s, or be appointed by &s;tate letters of ordination. My letters of ordina|tion are, my zeal, my charity, my ardent love for my dear children of the village&mdash;if I were more learned, I &s;hould add my knowledge; but, alas! we all know very little; to man every error is pardonable, but want of humility.</P>
<P>We have a public walk, with a &s;preading elm tree at one end of it, and a circle of green round it, with a convenient bench. Here I &s;hall draw together the children as they are playing round me. I &s;hall point to the vines laden with fruit, to the orchard, to the herds of cattle lowing round us, to the di&s;tant hills &s;tretching one behind another, and they will a&s;k me how the&s;e things came? I &s;hall tell them all I know or have heard from wi&s;e men who have lived before me; they will be penetrated with love and veneration; they will kneel, I &s;hall kneel with them; they will not be at my feet, but all of us at the feet of that good Being, whom we &s;hall wor&s;hip together; and thus they will receive within their tender minds, <HI>a religion.</HI> The old men will come &s;ometimes from having depo&s;|ited under the green &s;od one of their companions, and place them&s;elves by my &s;ide; they will look wi&s;hfully at the turf, and anxiou&s;ly inquire&mdash;<HI>Is he gone forever?

<P>In a clear night, when the &s;tars &s;lide over our head, they will a&s;k what tho&s;e bright bodies are, and by what rules they ri&s;e and &s;et? And we will conver&s;e about different forms of being, and di&s;tant worlds, in the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, governed by the &s;ame laws, till we feel our minds rai&s;ed from what is grovelling, and refined from what is &s;ordid.</P>
<P>You talk of Nature&mdash;this is Nature; and if you could at this moment extingui&s;h religion in the minds of all the world, thus would it be kindled again. You have changed our holy days; you have an undoubted right, as our civil governors, &s;o to do; it is very im|material whether they are kept once in &s;even days, or once in ten; &s;ome, however, you will leave us, and when they occur, I &s;hall tell tho&s;e who choo&s;e to hear me, of the beauty and utility of virtue, and of the dig|nity of upright conduct. We &s;hall talk of good men who have lived in the world, and of the doctrines they have taught; and if any of them have been per&s;ecuted and put to death for their virtue, we &s;hall reverence their memories the more&mdash;I hope in all this there is no harm. There is a book, out of which I have &s;ometimes taught my people: It &s;ays, we are to love tho&s;e who do us hurt, and to pour oil and wine into the wounds of a &s;tranger; it has enabled my children to bear patiently the &s;poiling of their goods, and to give up their own intere&s;t to the general welfare. I think it cannot be a very bad book. I wi&s;h more of it had been read in your town; perhaps you would not have had &s;o many a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and ma&s;&s;acres. In this book we hear of a per&s;on called JESUS; &s;ome wor&s;hip him as a God; others, as I am told, &s;ay it is wrong to do &s;o;&mdash;&s;ome teach that he exi&s;ted before the beginning of ages; others, that he was born of Jo&s;eph and Mary. I cannot tell whether the&s;e contro|ver&s;ies will ever be decided; but in the mean time, I

<P>Fellow citizens, as I travelled hither from my own village, I &s;aw pea&s;ants &s;etting among&s;t the &s;moak|ing ruins of their cottages; rich men and women re|duced to deplorable poverty; fathers lamenting their children in the bloom and pride of youth; and I &s;aid to my&s;elf&mdash;<HI>the&s;e people cannot afford to part with their religion.</HI> But indeed you cannot take it away; if, con|trary to your fir&s;t declaration, you choo&s;e to try the experiment of per&s;ecuting it, you will only make us prize it the more, and love it the better. Religion, <HI>true</HI> or <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the mind of man, that you have already begun to make your&s;elves a new one. You are &s;owing the &s;eeds of &s;uper&s;tition at the moment you fancy you are de&s;troying &s;uper&s;tition; and in two or three generations your po&s;terity will be wor&s;hipping &s;ome clum&s;y idol, with the rights perhaps of a bloody Moloch, or a la&s;civious Thamu&s;ar. It was not worth while to have been philo&s;ophers, and de&s;troyed the images of our &s;aints for this; but let every one choo&s;e the religion that plea&s;es him: I and my pari&s;hioners are content with ours; it teaches us to bear the evils your childi&s;h or &s;anguinary decrees have helped to bring upon the country.</P></Q>

<P>THE value of an equal and accommodating di&s;|po&s;ition, cannot, I conceive, be too highly appre|ciated, too energetically inculcated, or too often ex|patiated upon. Such, and &s;o frequent are the vici&s;|&s;itudes of life, that an unbending mind, refu&s;ing to yield to that nece&s;&s;ity which is impo&s;ed upon its ex|i&s;tence, is broken by the boi&s;terous winds which are abroad, and too frequently pro&s;trated by tho&s;e calam|ities, or adver&s;e tran&s;itions, to which an acquie&s;cent &s;pirit finds it wi&s;dom, with humble patience, to &s;ubmit. "The burden becomes light by being well borne." I have not forgot that this is an old adage, but I re|peat, that its antiquity doth not deduct the &s;malle&s;t par|ticle from its rationality; the&s;e venerable old &s;aws fre|quently contain the very pith and e&s;&s;ence of &s;entiment, and I have often thought that the pen appropriated to the pointing out their excellence, might be <HI>much wor&s;e</HI> employed.</P>
<P>Say, thou di&s;contented and repining mortal, what emol|ument ha&s;t thou derived from continually tracing the dark &s;hades in the picture? Ha&s;t thou received injuries, and do&s;t thou find thy recompen&s;e in eternally brood|ing thereon? Do &s;uch contemplations meliorate thy vir|tues, or promote the &s;un&s;hine of the &s;oul? Are the ge|nial and &s;alutary airs of tranquillity originated or waft|ed forward by reflections, which wound the mind, and fire the bo&s;om with indignation?</P>
<P>Health of body, &s;erenity of &s;oul, &s;weet complacency, &s;prightly mirth&mdash;all the&s;e are among the victims of <HI>cheri&s;hed, gloomy</HI> and <HI>corroding re&s;entment!</HI> The &s;oul of the vindictive is the region of horror, and the mo&s;t black and baleful pa&s;&s;ions harbour there. What are

the plea&s;ures of the angry man? It is undeniably true that he is his own tormentor; and if he throws the reins upon that implacability and inveterate revenge which &s;o fearfully predominate in his brea&s;t, his mo&s;t uniform or confirmed enemy could hardly devi&s;e means more adequate or better calculated for the de&s;truction of his felicity. Have not the attentions I have received been commen&s;urate with that merit, with which my &s;elf-par|tiality hath inve&s;ted me? Have I to complain of cold indifference or neglect from tho&s;e upon whom nature, circum&s;tances, or amity, had furni&s;hed me with indi&s;|putable claims? Have I not only been defrauded of tho&s;e dues to which the inviolable laws of &s;ociety hath entitled me; but hath in&s;ult, and even outrage been al&s;o added? Well, it is really a pity-moving &s;ituation, <HI>and I would certainly turn as often as po&s;&s;ible from the view.</HI> Can&s;t thou derive either &s;atisfaction or profit from an enumeration of thy grievances? I pity the malignant &s;pirit, which can delight to prey upon food on which the fiends a&s;&s;embled in Pandemonium might joy to riot. Reader, if thou wert ever angry, then ha&s;t thou expe|rienced the ravages which the war of the pa&s;&s;ions mak|eth upon thy peace&mdash;like all other wars, de&s;olation follows in the train, and rea&s;on can never e&s;timate their profit; yet, if upon a fair calculation, the &s;um total proves thee a &s;ingle drachm, or even a half drachm, nay, the hundredth part of a &s;cruple the gainer; I will then con&s;ent that thou &s;halt in future vex thy&s;elf to a &s;keleton more hideous than the brain of fertile poe&s;y ere conjured up, though &s;ickening envy, or yellow jeal|ou&s;y, or fell revenge, &s;talked full in view&mdash;"Yes," cried Maria, <Q>the &s;en&s;ations which are attendant upon the contemplation of a virtuous action, are undoubt|edly divine. <HI>I would pa&s;s by a thou&s;and &s;uppo&s;ed injuries,</HI> but I would dwell forever upon the contemplation of genuine worth. <HI>The reflections which are the accom|paniments of offences do not exerci&s;e, they do not invigorate the finer feelings of the &s;oul.</HI> I li&s;tened to the plea&s;ing matron,</Q> continued Maria, <Q>I li&s;tened with rapture, for her tongue expatiated upon the philanthropy of Alberto.</Q></P>

"My &s;on," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>was on a voyage; he was a &s;tranger, and he took rank among the lowe&s;t grade which made up the &s;hip's company&mdash;my &s;on fell &s;ick; he was dangerou&s;ly ill; gloomy was his &s;itua|tion&mdash;but Alberto commanded the &s;hip; he &s;ought out my &s;on; he &s;oothed his woes; he lodged him in his own cabin; he attended him in per&s;on, and my &s;on was re&s;tored to health. Immea&s;urable are my obligations to Alberto; and his name, next to that of the Supreme, is entitled to my utmo&s;t veneration. Alberto is my brother; I am many years his &s;enior; I have known him the mo&s;t beauteous of infants, and he gladdened the hearts of his parents. How &s;weet are the prai&s;es of a brother! Alberto, dear Alberto, for this, and many &s;imilar anecdotes of thy &s;hort life, I will remit unto thee all, and every one of the peccadillos, which, &s;hading thy character, do but &s;erve to render thy virtues the more con&s;picuous.

<P>The election of Maria exemplified her accu&s;tomed penetration; for reiterated ob&s;ervation of proper and becoming actions, has upon the heart the mo&s;t &s;aluta|ry effect. Was I called upon to delineate the path which would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly lead to as great a &s;hare of happine&s;s as is compatible with humanity, I &s;hould dictate to the candidate for felicity, a frequent recur|rence to the fair &s;ide of per&s;ons, circum&s;tances and events; almo&s;t every thing may be viewed in different mediums, and even the various empha&s;izing of any given narration, may furni&s;h the &s;ame fact with fea|tures directly oppo&s;ite.

<P>Re&s;olution can do much, the embodied faculties of the mind, di&s;ciplined by virtue, are equal to almo&s;t any &s;ituation; and they effectually arre&s;t the progre&s;s of that fretful <HI>ennui</HI> which is commonly the offspring of indolence, and &s;trongly marks the want of tho&s;e efforts that are &s;o proper to a rational being.</P>

coloured; and it is ju&s;t as true at the pre&s;ent day, as it was near eighteen hundred years &s;ince. Seneca, upon anger, may not be in your library; I take leave, there|fore, to tran&s;cribe an extract from his admired page.</P>
<P>"He was much in the right, whoever he was, that fir&s;t called anger a &s;hort madne&s;s; for they have both of them the &s;ame &s;ymptoms; and there is &s;o wonder|ful a re&s;emblance between the tran&s;ports of choler and tho&s;e of frenzy, that it is a hard matter to know the one from the other. A bold, fierce and threatening countenance, as pale as a&s;hes, and in the &s;ame moment as red as blood; a glaring eye, a wrinkled brow, violent motions, the hands re&s;tle&s;s and perpetually in action, wringing and menacing, &s;napping of the joints, &s;tamp|ing with the feet, the hair &s;tarting, trembling lips, a for|ced voice; the &s;peech fal&s;e and broken, deep and frequent &s;ighs, and gha&s;tly looks; the veins &s;well, the heart pants, the knees knock; with a hundred di&s;mal accidents that are common to both di&s;tempers. Neither is anger, only a bare re&s;emblance of madne&s;s, but many times an irrecoverable tran&s;ition into the thing it&s;elf. How many per&s;ons have we known, read, and heard of, that have lo&s;t their wits in a pa&s;&s;ion, and never came to them&s;elves again? It is therefore to be avoided not only for moderation &s;ake, but al&s;o for health. Now, if the outward appearance of anger be hideous, how deformed mu&s;t that mind be that is hara&s;&s;ed with it? for it leaves no place either for coun&s;el or friend&s;hip, hone&s;ty or good manners; no place either for the ex|erci&s;e of rea&s;on, or for the offices of life. If I were to de&s;cribe it, I would draw a tyger bathed in blood; &s;harp &s;et, and ready to take a leap at its prey; or dre&s;s it up as the poets repre&s;ent the furies, with whips &s;nakes and flames. It &s;hould likewi&s;e be &s;our, livid, full of &s;cars, and wallowing in gore, raging up and down, de&s;troy|ing, grinning, bellowing, and pur&s;uing; &s;ick of all other things, and mo&s;t of all of it&s;elf. It turns beauty into deformity, and the calme&s;t coun&s;els into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: It di&s;orders our very garments, and fills the mind with horror. How abominable then is it in the &s;oul!

Is not he a mad man who hath lo&s;t the government of him&s;elf, and is to&s;&s;ed hither and thither by his fury, as by a tempe&s;t; the executioner of his own revenge, both with his heart and hand; and the murderer of his neare&s;t friends? The &s;malle&s;t matter moves it and makes us un&s;ociable and inacce&s;&s;ible.

<P>It was on a beautiful morning of April la&s;t that, &s;eeking the plea&s;ures of &s;olitude, I wandered from the company at our little inn, and, mounting my hor&s;e, I threw the reins upon his neck, determining to leave to chance the direction of my ramble. We were equally &s;trangers to the road, and a few miles in a country hardly emerging from a &s;tate of nature, conducted us to a thick wood, when, &s;ecuring my hor&s;e to the trunk of a tall tree, I prepared to penetrate a coppice which pre&s;ented the only ve&s;tige of the wants or ingenuity of man, which the eye could trace; and, proceeding onward to the extremity of the wood, which bordered a few acres of ground, equally remarkable for the &s;terility of its &s;oil, and the &s;trong indications it bore of the per&s;evering patience and uncommon indu&s;try of its proprietors, I was rou&s;ed from my reverie by a number of voices that, arre&s;ting my attention, imme|diately drew me forward to the place from whence they proceeded. I &s;u&s;pected the employment of our ru&s;tics, and, le&s;t I &s;hould interrupt operations &s;o prop|er to the &s;ea&s;on, I made my advances with care. The opening &s;cene pre&s;ented a poor built cottage, which, in language unequivocal, proclaimed indu&s;trious pov|erty; the heathy appearance of the grounds evinced the &s;tinted produce, with which they repaid the ma&s;|ter's culture; a few &s;heep and a &s;ingle cow, who&s;e thin forms demon&s;trated the &s;canty pittance on which they fed, &s;tood forth additional vouchers of the penu|rious &s;oil. But a fertilizing &s;tream, which murmured by, and bore in its bo&s;om various de&s;criptions of the finny tribe, diver&s;ified the view, and gave birth to the plea&s;ures of hope.</P>
<P>A well looking man was bu&s;ily employed in turn|ing up and &s;haping the glebe; a &s;entimental carol vibrated upon his tongue, and his features were ex|pre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="327" REF="034162_0326_0FFC68AEEBB65E60">
of content. A graceful female at a little di&s;|tance, round whom no le&s;s than eleven children, of different ages, were collected&mdash;was directing the eld|e&s;t boy, a ro&s;y-cheeked youth, in &s;etting &s;ome plants, while &s;he her&s;elf committed to the prepared earth, tho&s;e &s;eeds from which &s;he cheerfully anticipated the di&s;tant harve&s;t. The ve&s;tments of the family were the ve&s;t|ments of penury; and if they could be con&s;idered as garments, they were entitled, for &s;o re&s;pectable an ap|pellation, to the unwearied diligence, which, &s;till fol|lowing the well worn robe, had &s;o repeatedly repaired each time made breach, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to decide, of what hue or texture it was originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed: Yet the voice of gladne&s;s echoed round, and the hi|larity of the heart &s;eemed impre&s;&s;ed upon every feature.</P>
<P>I contemplated, with folded arms and grateful ad|miration, the uncommon group. The face of the matron was not immediately turned toward me, nei|ther had the &s;hepherd ob&s;erved me; but the children had begun to amu&s;e them&s;elves with my figure, when their mother, having fini&s;hed her employ, was drawn by their innocent mirth to the &s;pot on which I was fixed. I have already confe&s;&s;ed mingling &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure at the gay tranquillity, which was apparently the appendages of a &s;cene &s;o barren of good, and &s;o remarkably devoid of the eligibles of life; but no language can expre&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment, when, in the countenance of the penuriou&s;ly garbed matron, I re|cognized the once opulent, truly amiable, and highly de&s;erving Flavilla!</P>
<P>Gracious God!&mdash;&s;pontaneou&s;ly I exclaimed&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible? do I in reality behold the long idolized, and ever charming Mi&s;s Kneller? Flavilla, accu&s;tomed to the vici&s;&s;itudes and caprices of events, uttered no per|turbed exclamation; but, with that genuine dignity, which nature delights to confer upon a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innate worth, with a grace and manner which I have not often &s;een equalled in a drawing-room, pre|&s;enting her hand, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction in an interview &s;o unexpected; and, leading me to her hum|ble abode, we were &s;oon joined by Honorius and the
<PB N="328" REF="034162_0327_0FFC68AD5B3272B8">
little family. I had known Flavilla from early youth: She was born to affluence, and her education had been in the fir&s;t line. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kneller, had no other child; and this daughter, promi&s;ing in every view, was, of cour&s;e, regarded as an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure. Honorius was the man of her heart, and her union with the youth &s;he loved, and who recipro|cated her attachment, received the cheerful &s;anction of the authors of her being.</P>
<P>Soon after the marriage of Mi&s;s Kneller, her pa|rental friends paid the great debt of nature, leaving Honorius and Flavilla in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an ample for|tune. But, from this period, thick clouds began to gather, and they experienced a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing rever&s;e of circum&s;tances. The <HI>career</HI> of their misfortunes was u&s;hered in by a dreadful conflagration, in which their man&s;ion-hou&s;e, containing many valuable articles, was reduced to a&s;hes; a &s;eries of calamities &s;ucceeded, un|til, at length, of all their va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;carce a ve&s;|tige remained; yet a principle of rectitude triumphed in their &s;ouls; of their inborn integrity, the malice of their fate could not dive&s;t them; and di&s;charging, with intere&s;t, the la&s;t farthing for which they were in|debted, with the poor pittance which was left, they retired, like Thomp&s;on's Lavinia&mdash;"<HI>far from tho&s;e &s;cenes that knew their better days,</HI>" and purcha&s;ed in this remote &s;pot&mdash;<HI>'twas all they could</HI>&mdash;the barren grounds from which they have ever &s;ince obtained a &s;canty and hard earned &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Their original &s;tock con&s;i&s;t|ed of thirty &s;heep, one cow, and a yoke of oxen; the &s;heep were almo&s;t immediately de&s;troyed by the wolves; the cow fell a victim, probably, to the &s;teril &s;oil to which &s;he was confined; and, in an attempt to level a tall tree, one of their oxen was killed upon the &s;pot. Succeeding years has reduced to the lowe&s;t &s;tate the nece&s;&s;aries which made up their per&s;onal and family wardrobe, and it has not been in their power to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the &s;malle&s;t &s;upplies! Yet, &s;trange to tell, neither time nor &s;orrow hath been able to infix their deadly fangs in the bo&s;om of Flavilla; health dances in her veins, and beauty glows upon her cheek; her

It was impo&s;&s;ible I could forbear expre&s;&s;ing my a&s;ton|i&s;hment and my admiration! and when I inquired by what means they had, Flavilla e&s;pecially, &s;upported &s;uch an uncommon mea&s;ure of tranquillity, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch a calamitous rever&s;e of circum&s;tances, Flavilla replied&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is &s;imply this, we have con&s;idered the <HI>brevity</HI> of life, and the certainty of our removal to another, a better, and a more permanent &s;tate of being; we have adopted, realized, and reduced to practice, the &s;entiment of an admired poet; we have been taught by experi|ence, that "<HI>earth-born cares are vain;</HI> that <HI>man wants but little here below,</HI>" we have fully known; and we do not expect to want "<HI>that little long.</HI>"</P>
<P>To contribute to the relief of Flavilla, or her family, is impo&s;&s;ible; for &s;ince the di&s;covery of her retirement, in regard to which &s;he hath enjoined the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ecre&s;y, however ingenious I have been in my attempts to aug|ment their finances, I have &s;till found my&s;elf, and with a firmne&s;s almo&s;t unexampled, uniformly repul&s;ed. To have put Flavilla in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing which her &s;ituation &s;eemed to claim, would have been the highe&s;t luxury which benevolence could have ta&s;ted; but while I regret, as an individual, her &s;teady rejec|tion of all pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I cannot but admire the genuine elevation of her high-&s;ouled &s;entiments.

<P>DISGUISES are frequently the convenient a&s;y|lums of villany; and as they are always que&s;|tionable, they are with propriety always &s;u&s;pected. To trace the labyrinth of folly, into which the flagitious delinquent is precipitated, requires more than human penetration. Many are the windings and doublings of the proficient in error; all his paths are intricate; he is fruitful in &s;ubterfuges, and he is enveloped in my&s;|tery. I do not &s;ay that virtue hath never worn a veil, or that integrity may not &s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;&s;ary to hold up fal&s;e lights; but I contend that the <HI>practice</HI> of <HI>deception,</HI>

<P>The &s;mooth &s;urface of the limpid &s;tream out-&s;preads its azure flow to the mo&s;t curious inve&s;tigation; the orient luminary of day emits a flood of light; it i&s;&s;ues forth a tran&s;cendent body, elevated in it&s;elf, while its &s;plendours are confe&s;&s;ed by every eye; and the upright ancient wi&s;hed for a gla&s;s in his brea&s;t, that the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of concealment might be thus era&s;ed from the cata|logue of his abilities. Ambiguity ca&s;ts a veil over the mo&s;t irreproachable life; it originates the <HI>invidious ar|dours of &s;peculation;</HI> and it gives to the features of vir|tue the contour of folly. I confe&s;s I am charmed by frankne&s;s of &s;oul; ingenuity and integrity of manners, carry with them their title to my unre&s;erved e&s;teem, and upon the hone&s;t &s;incere man, rea&s;on, unbia&s;&s;ed by fa&s;hion or habit, is ever ready to pronounce a eulogy. I abhor duplicity in every form; doubtful meanings, <HI>double entendres,</HI> playing upon words, with every baga|telle of this de&s;cription, are, in my opinion, at lea&s;t in|elegant and unbecoming; nor can I allow that they make any part of <HI>manly &s;en&s;e, true wit,</HI> or <HI>genuine hu|mour.</HI> In a fair, open, con&s;i&s;tent manner of thinking, conver&s;ing and acting, there is both dignity and pro|priety; and an elevated reputation is the well earned reward of per&s;evering and unequivocal worth. We li&s;t|en, with unre&s;trained plea&s;ure, to the man of unim|peached honour; to him, who&s;e upright &s;oul hath never been entangled in the wiles of deceit, who hath never deba&s;ed him&s;elf by an alliance with fal&s;ehood, nor &s;ported with the credulity of his a&s;&s;ociates; who, wor&s;hipping at the &s;hrine of truth, hath &s;till held her inviolate, regarding all her in&s;tigations as &s;acred, and di&s;daining to purcha&s;e the <HI>&s;mile</HI> of <HI>levity at the expen&s;e of that j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t which borrows its humour from a breach of ve|racity;</HI> and it is then that we confer upon him the mo&s;t honorary di&s;tinction, when, with unlimited confi|dence, we repo&s;e upon his word the mo&s;t unhe&s;itating faith.</P>

It is dangerous to amu&s;e our&s;elves with the <HI>&s;emblance</HI> of <HI>vice; the habit</HI> of uttering <HI>merry fal&s;ehoods,</HI> will &s;oon blunt the fine edge of our feelings, and we &s;hall ea&s;ily &s;lide into the mo&s;t <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>capital violations of truth.</HI> Integrity dignifies a character; frankne&s;s is truly ami|able, and if the offence is not highly enormous, &s;often|ed by the ingenuity of a candid acknowledgment, we are ready to pre&s;s the offender to our bo&s;oms; we al|low him a &s;econd lea&s;e of our e&s;teem, and it depends altogether on him&s;elf, whether we &s;hall ever again &s;erve upon him a writ of ejection.

<P>I grant they are at pre&s;ent <HI>comparatively</HI> &s;mall; yet if I am unhappy, I am unhappy, whatever may have pro|duced the evil; and when the peace of a family, or even of an individual is involved, a full explanation, with ev|ery attempt to &s;oothe, is as nece&s;&s;ary as it is generous; and it &s;hould always be remembered, that the unex|tingui&s;hed flame, which, raging with increa&s;ing vio|lence, pur&s;ues its de&s;olating career, and i&s;&s;ues in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing conflagration, was once a lambent &s;park, who&s;e genial warmth might ea&s;ily have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and who&s;e agency, under a judicious direc|tion, might have produced the mo&s;t beneficial effects.</P>
<P>Yes, the peace of families is too often &s;acrificed to fal&s;e delicacy, and to an ill-judged &s;ilence on facts and circum&s;tances, which ought to have been &s;crupu|lou&s;ly narrated and critically examined.

recollection; &s;he is not per&s;onally known to me, but although the va&s;t Atlantic rolls its waves between us, yet, with reiterated plea&s;ure, I have frequently traced the lineaments of her fair mind, as I have &s;een it pour|trayed in many a well-written page, the product of her inimitable pen. She hath, I am told, a plea&s;ing exterior, and her under&s;tanding is elevated much a|bove the level of mediocrity. Nature, when &s;he be|&s;towed upon her uncommon parts, endowed her al&s;o with an exqui&s;ite tenderne&s;s of &s;oul. Her imagina|tion is lively and fertile, and &s;he has a ta&s;te capa|ble of di&s;tingui&s;hing, and highly enjoying the beauties of poetry. Early enli&s;ting in the &s;ervice of the Mu&s;es, &s;he became one of their mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful votaries; and, from the beautiful parterres which ornament the Par|na&s;&s;ian grounds, &s;he hath &s;kilfully and happily combin|ed many an elegant fancied bouquet. She was always a nymph of the <HI>&s;ober-&s;uited train,</HI> and to airs the mo&s;t pen&s;ively melodious her lyre was uniformly attuned.</P>
<P>Sweet Eliza! in the enchanting walks of poe&s;y, thy feet have cea&s;ed to &s;tray; that confirmed melancholy, which the &s;unny beams of hope can no longer impre&s;s, will no more permit thee to attune the neglected chords; the voice of the chantre&s;s is forever mute, and the lovely min&s;trel hath forgotten to charm. Unhap|py fair one! the ro&s;e of thy tranquillity is blighted, and "<HI>thy violets, alas! have all withered.</HI>"</P>
<P>It is to the ill-judged &s;ilence of Eliza, and her ma|ternal parent, that her misfortunes mu&s;t be imputed, The &s;tory of her life is &s;imple: I owed unreturnable obligations to her father; it was to him I was indebt|ed for the &s;y&s;tematic and rational mode of thinking, which has con&s;tituted the mo&s;t tranquil and refined moments of my exi&s;tence. He was a man in the lite|rary line; his writings are copious and energetic; and for &s;trength of argument, per&s;picuity of diction, and &s;elf-evident demon&s;tration, he hath never yet been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed; but having attained, in his favourite pur&s;uit, the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible excellence; he became nearly ab&s;orbed in tho&s;e contemplations from which originated &s;o large a part of his felicity, and repre|hen&s;ibly

inattentive to every con&s;ideration which he deemed of le&s;s moment. It too often happens that real or original genius, although rich in re&s;ources, and di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the mo&s;t &s;hining qualifications, is never|thele&s;s found de&s;titute of tho&s;e very nece&s;&s;ary requi|&s;ites, which can alone be&s;tow a capability of a bene|ficial intercour&s;e with mankind.</P>
<P>Mr. Mortimor, the father of Eliza, made his nup|tial choice with &s;o little di&s;cretion, as to exchange the marriage vow with a woman, who, at the very mo|ment &s;he met him at the altar, knew her&s;elf to be the wife of another! With this perfidiou&s;ly abandoned in|grate, he lived in total ignorance of her criminal con|nexion; and lavi&s;hing upon her every proof of an at|tachment almo&s;t unexampled, until the perjured mi&s;|creant, having &s;tripped him of every valuable article which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, found means to ab&s;cond with the paramour of her choice, at a period when the treach|erou&s;ly betrayed Mortimor was engaged in the di&s;|charge of &s;ome benevolent offices, which his philan|thropic di&s;po&s;ition had impo&s;ed upon him as duties.</P>
<P>It was not until after her elopement, that the turpi|tude of her life was di&s;clo&s;ed to him; and yet he could not, even then, although convinced of her atrocity, be per&s;uaded to take mea&s;ures calculated to bring her to condign puni&s;hment! Many years elap&s;ed before the wound he had received admitted a cure; his ten|derne&s;s of &s;oul, and his innate &s;en&s;e of rectitude, &s;till combated his peace, and rea&s;on, for a long time, plead in vain. At length, however, the lenient hand of a&s;|&s;uaging years, aided by the intellectual accompli&s;h|ments, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing exterior, of a truly de&s;erving female, effectuated the mo&s;t &s;alutary change. Hope once more dawned in his bo&s;om; it gleamed like &s;ome heavenly vi&s;itant athwart the melancholy region of his benighted &s;oul; by degrees it obliterated the gloo|my ideas which hovered there, and he again a&s;&s;erted the native dignity of his character. To the &s;weet &s;ooth|er of his &s;orrows, his hours of lei&s;ure were invariably de|voted; a &s;entimental intercour&s;e commenced; it was ameliorated by the &s;tricte&s;t amity, and it terminated in an attachment of the tendere&s;t kind.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="034162_0335_0FFC689AAB20C968">
Hymen once more light for Mortimor his &s;acred torch; and had he attended to &s;ome legal &s;teps, which &s;hould previou&s;ly have been taken, the au&s;pices under which he entered into this &s;econd engagement, would have been mo&s;t happy: Yet, tho&s;e arrangements, which &s;lower &s;ouls would have deemed indi&s;pen&s;able, mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned delays; the proce&s;s of the law was tedious; Mortimor had many enemies; ob&s;tacles might be interpo&s;ed; and if upon application he &s;hould not be able to obtain the nece&s;&s;ary form of divorce, his expectation of happine&s;s would be defeated. What was to be done? Concealment was a ready re&s;ource; and, wrapping him&s;elf about in the veil of &s;ecre&s;y, in his own retired apartment, in the pre&s;ence of the ho|ly prie&s;t and a few &s;elect friends, he plighted his wil|ling faith. Mrs. Mortimor (&s;till received merely as the friend of her hu&s;band) retained her family name; and, although many might &s;u&s;pect, tho&s;e only who were bound to &s;ecre&s;y could deci&s;ively pronounce.</P>
<P>At length, however, revolving months u&s;hered into the world the infant Eliza; and impenetrable my&s;tery &s;tanding centinel at her birth, &s;he was produced in &s;o|ciety by the name of Montague; and her parents in|troduced her as the orphan daughter of decea&s;ed rela|tives. Indeed, having conducted their engagement with &s;o little ob&s;ervance of forms, however <HI>innocent</HI> in
<HI>intention</HI> and in <HI>fact</HI> the parties in reality were, the &s;e|vere penalty annexed by the laws of England, again&s;t that irregularity or breach, a de&s;cription of which would undeniably involve their connexion, rendered it incum|bent upon them carefully to avoid an explanation.</P>
<P>Eliza was educated with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous atten|tion; &s;he was nurtured by the hand of elegance, and trained to the ob&s;ervance of every virtue. As early as her opening rea&s;on authorized a confidence &s;o im|portant, under the &s;tronge&s;t injunctions of inviolable &s;ilence, &s;he was made acquainted with the &s;ecret of her birth; and that di&s;cretion, armed by filial piety, with which &s;he guarded a communication on which was &s;u&s;pended the life of her father, abundantly ju&s;tified the repo&s;ing a tru&s;t of &s;uch a nature in &s;o tender a

bo&s;om. Fifteen happy years were pa&s;&s;ed by Eliza, amid the &s;oft endearments of parental tenderne&s;s; each cheerful morn was u&s;hered in by new proofs of provi|dent care, and the feathery hours were all marked by gentle admonitions, tender cautions, or well-judged ad|vice; and each returning evening &s;aw her encircled by tho&s;e arms, and pre&s;&s;ed to the faithful bo&s;oms of per|&s;ons, who &s;ealed upon her balmy lips their wi&s;hes for the repo&s;e of the night, always concluding their pious benedictions by &s;o natural an avowal of feelings, which were the genuine offspring of a &s;pecies of tenderne&s;s that perhaps cannot be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed. How fatal for Eliza was the hour, that ju&s;t at this period robbed her of a father, who, actuated by a &s;pirit of univer&s;al benevo|lence, and breathing the milde&s;t and mo&s;t benign ex|pre&s;&s;ions of philanthropy, glowed with uncommon ten|derne&s;s for a daughter, whom, in his mo&s;t unimpa&s;&s;ioned moments, he could not but acknowledge as highly de|&s;erving, every way amiable, and compri&s;ing in her&s;elf the &s;um total of a father's wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The demi&s;e of Mr. Mortimor pre&s;ented a moment, in which it would have been wi&s;dom to have opened on &s;ociety, with a full and unequivocal eclairci&s;&s;ement. Death had placed the victim the law would have de|manded, beyond the reach of its penalties; and, clothed in the habiliments of con&s;cious integrity, <HI>they had then nothing to hazard by an explanation.</HI> The prie&s;t, who joined the hands of the parents of Eliza, could, at that juncture, have been produced; and the few friends who were pre&s;ent at the marriage, were &s;till in exi&s;tence.&mdash;Alas, alas! they are now con&s;igned to the &s;ilent tomb! and, &s;trange to tell, letting &s;lip the golden &s;ea&s;on of op|portunity, Mrs. Mortimor was &s;till known by the name of Laughton, while Eliza was addre&s;&s;ed by that of Montague!</P>

But her choice once made, &s;he deferred not to bani&s;h from the bo&s;om of him &s;he approbated, that perturbed &s;u&s;pen&s;e that &s;o fatally corrodes each promi&s;ed joy; and al|though her every &s;tep was pointed by virgin delicacy, yet did &s;he &s;kilfully enwreath therewith a noble and dignified frankne&s;s, which hu&s;hed that tumultuous whirlwind of the pa&s;&s;ions, that hath &s;hipwrecked the peace of many a manly brea&s;t. Pity &s;he was not per|mitted to be uniformly explicit; but the maternal pro|hibition was &s;trangely and unaccountably interpo&s;ed, and her nuptials were &s;olemnized under that di&s;gui&s;e, which, although ju&s;tifiable for a time, was mo&s;t im|prudently continued, and &s;hould never have been worn in the pre&s;ence of a man, whom, in every other re&s;pect, &s;he had honoured by the mo&s;t unbounded confidence; but &s;he remained per&s;everingly, reprehen&s;ibly &s;ilent! and this &s;ilence hath been fatal to her peace. The fir&s;t years of her wedded life were uncommonly &s;erene; &s;he bore to Altamont many fine children; and none but tranquil days &s;eemed written for her. How pre|carious are terre&s;trial joys! An untoward accident &s;ud|denly rever&s;ed the &s;cene. A paper, written by her&s;elf, and addre&s;&s;ed to her mother, breathing the language of ambiguity, deeply fraught with my&s;tery, and yet ob&s;curely hinting at the truth, unfortunately met the eye of Altamont! To the nice&s;t &s;en&s;e of honour Atla|mont is exqui&s;itely alive&mdash;the &s;oul of ingenuity is his, and the delicacy of his &s;entiments refu&s;eth to tolerate the mo&s;t di&s;tant appearance of deception. He drank in the contagious lines; every word operated as an envenomed draught; and while he &s;hrunk from the fearful contents, they became, in effect, like tho&s;e &s;ubtil poi&s;ons, which are &s;aid to procure immediate death; for they infixed their deadly fangs in the very vitals of that tranquillity, which he had fondly hoped was be|yond the malice of fate.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly the fiend, de&s;pair, embodied its mini&s;ters; they were bu&s;y about his heart; complacency was

cha&s;ed from his bo&s;om; the &s;miles of benevolence are no more; a deep and &s;ettled melancholy lowers upon his brow; and the &s;ullen &s;ilence which he ob&s;tinately ob&s;erves, effectually bars an eclairci&s;&s;ement. His hou&s;e, once the &s;eat of &s;ocial happine&s;s&mdash;now, alas! dire &s;u&s;picion, dark conjecture, and baleful jealou&s;y, hover there; and although months and years have re|volved, no beam of elucidation hath yet illumined tho&s;e heartfelt glooms, by which he is enveloped. The tear is upon the cheek of Eliza; and her dream of happi|ne&s;s, of terre&s;trial happine&s;s, is gone forever.</P>
<P>The deep melancholy which impre&s;&s;ed the mind of Altamont, was immediately &s;ucceeded by the mo&s;t alarming e&s;trangement; his temper &s;eems totally ru|ined. He regards the partner of his &s;ufferings with a mi&s;tru&s;tful kind of indignation; &s;he has lo&s;t his confi|dence; &s;he has every rea&s;on to believe &s;he no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his affection; and, the probability is, that was &s;he now to come forward with a full and undi&s;gui&s;ed explanation, it would produce no &s;alutary effect; her vouchers, as we ob&s;erved, are numbered with the dead; Altamont is haughty and implacable, and Eliza, hav|ing once indi&s;putably deceived him, it is to be feared that he will yield her no future credence!!!</P>

<P>UPON my word, Mr. Gleaner, I believe you are a &s;ly old fellow, after all. Let me tell you, Sir, it ill &s;uits with your <HI>a&s;&s;umed gravity,</HI> to be thus foi&s;ting your&s;elf into the &s;ecrets of all the young, hand&s;ome, married women of your acquaintance. Mighty fine, mighty fine, truly. <HI>Delicacy, for&s;ooth, forbid Monimia to que&s;tion her hu&s;band;</HI> but <HI>delicacy,</HI> it &s;eems, did not think proper to interfere, while &s;he contrived to pour her pity-moving tale into the bo&s;om of <HI>nobody knows who&mdash;one who is here, and there, and every where, and very po&s;&s;ibly not of much importance any where. A perfect Proteus to the imagination, a&s;&s;uming a thou&s;and fanta&s;tical forms, and becoming &s;tationary in no one re&s;pectable charac|ter; a bird of pa&s;&s;age, emigrating from &s;tate to &s;tate, and picking up a &s;canty pittance, after a whole month's toil, which but ill repays the labour of travelling through the dull pages he is &s;o &s;tudious to multiply.</HI> You may think me &s;evere, Mr. Gleaner, but I have the &s;atisfaction of knowing I am <HI>ju&s;t;</HI> and I add, that you might have gone on with your itinerant gleaning, to the end of the chapter, for me, if you had not rou&s;ed the feelings of an injured hu&s;band, by thus palpably in&s;inuating, that you are a greater favourite with his wife than he is him&s;elf! Really, Mr. Morality, you make a very pretty <HI>con&s;i&s;tent, heterogeneous</HI> figure; and I &s;hould like va&s;tly to have your motley image &s;tuck up in a print-&s;hop, by way of relief to the &s;tudies of the chubby-faced &s;chool-boy, as he trudges along the academical way to his daily labours.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e man &s;ays, that laughter doeth good like a medicine; and it is undeniably true, that the ludicrous is a wonderful &s;pecific in every intellectual complaint. But let me whi&s;per you, good Mr. Prig, you are a
<PB N="341" REF="034162_0340_0FFC688DF4C7FE50">
coxcomb; and you may ble&s;s your &s;tars that I am not able to collect the trio, which you have huddled to|gether in your la&s;t Gleaner; for, if I could name my fellow-&s;ufferers, we would unite together in obtaining a mo&s;t &s;ignal revenge; but you are &s;uch a doughty hero, and, withal, &s;o evane&s;cent a &s;pright, that you elude the force of common exertions.</P>
<P>How you became acquainted with Monimia's tale of &s;orrow, is an enigma, of which it will be conceived that <HI>delicacy</HI> forbids me to &s;eek an explanation! The probability is, that you have practi&s;ed upon her &s;im|plicity, and, in&s;inuating your&s;elf into the good graces of the afflicted fair one, by &s;ome illicit methods, you have at length obtained her confidence; and, as I am one of the be&s;t natured men in the world, extending the &s;ceptre of my clemency, I &s;hall view, with proper indulgence, the <HI>imbecilities of nature.</HI> Doubtle&s;s, I could have re&s;tored the tranquillity of my wife, with|out troubling either you or my&s;elf with my ob&s;erva|tions; but, be&s;ides that I conceive your temerity mer|its cha&s;ti&s;ement, as you have impertinently precipitat|ed me, and an affair which was wholly mine, to public view. I am induced to believe, that the eclairci&s;&s;ement hath thus acquired a kind of right to publicity.</P>
<P>Monimia will remember, that I not long &s;ince paid a vi&s;it to my relations at B&mdash;. My kin&s;man S&mdash;has a daughter, <HI>not yet twelve years old,</HI> who is very in|genious, and handles her &s;ci&s;&s;ors to admiration; <HI>&s;he cut my watch-paper, and &s;he will be proud of furni&s;hing Monimia with any little fancy pieces which &s;he may wi&s;h.</HI> On my return home, I made a di&s;play of my acqui&s;i|tion. Monimia, <HI>ha&s;tily</HI> and <HI>tremulou&s;ly, made &s;ome round about inquiries, relative to the fair artificer&mdash;the&s;e I would not under&s;tand&mdash;I di&s;like every &s;ymptom of &s;u&s;picion in la|dies; &s;u&s;picion looks &s;o like jealou&s;y, and jealou&s;y looks &s;o like want of confidence, I remained &s;ilent, and affected a kind of, what the ladies call, delicate embarra&s;&s;ment.</HI> Perhaps I was wrong; but had I been appri&s;ed that the impre&s;&s;ion made by <HI>&s;o light a thing as a watch-paper,</HI> could have been &s;o &s;erious, I &s;hould certainly have endeavoured to era&s;e it.</P>
<P>I have, Mr. Meddler, the honour&mdash;<HI>the honour</HI>&mdash;no, that's wrong&mdash;<HI>I have not the honour</HI>&mdash;I have <HI>the conde|&s;cen&s;ion</HI>

<SALUTE>MR. VIGILLIUS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have given your examples under fictitious names, I am not furni&s;hed with a rational cau&s;e of an|ger; and yet, Sir, you have &s;o well pointed circum&s;tan|ces, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for the real claimant to avoid a&s;&s;uming habiliments, which can fit no one but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>My&s;tery is indeed the parent of conjecture, and con|cealment mo&s;t &s;urely engenders &s;u&s;picion. Authors are doubtle&s;s ju&s;tifiable, in procuring every warranta|ble illu&s;tration of their &s;entiments, and of tho&s;e infer|ences which they wi&s;h to deduce; and even a <HI>de&s;ire</HI> to inform, or to improve, is entitled to grateful re&s;pect. If my Clari&s;&s;a, or her favoured Altamont, can furni&s;h either amu&s;ement or in&s;truction to the Gleaner and his numerous readers, any little anecdote, relative to us, is extremely at their &s;ervice. My Clari&s;&s;a is more dear to my &s;oul than the life-blood which warms me to ex|i&s;tence; &s;he hath not, &s;he never had, nor ever can have, a rival in my affections. She reigns &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s in my heart, and to her peerle&s;s virtues my every thought does homage. Yet, while I avow a fealty &s;o unre&s;erved, I am bold enough to confe&s;s my property in the beautifully glo&s;&s;y look of hair, a di&s;covery of which has been &s;o &s;urreptitiou&s;ly obtained; that I have trea&s;ured up this lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k of hair, I al&s;o acknowledge; nor will I con&s;ent to part with it, until the la&s;t breath &s;hall quiver upon my lips. Further, my own hands &s;evered the conte&s;ted lock from the head of a lovely female, who was dear to me as nature, as amity, or as my fonde&s;t hopes of happine&s;s. All this is mo&s;t true; and it is likewi&s;e true, that this female was not Clari&s;&s;a!</P>
<P>Are you immea&s;urably a&s;toni&s;hed? Step to the oth|er &s;ide of the piece, and it will a&s;&s;ume another hue. I am not a native of America; I have lived only five years in this paradi&s;e of liberty. I had a &s;i&s;ter&mdash;good
<PB N="343" REF="034162_0342_0FFA653A5A4BA8B0">
God! how unfortunate was that &s;i&s;ter! amiable as virtue, and indulgent as Heaven; &s;he merited every thing &s;hort of adoration, from that world which per&s;e|cuted her, almo&s;t from the fir&s;t hour of her exi&s;tence. Execrable world!&mdash;the virtues of a Clari&s;&s;a were nec|e&s;&s;ary to reconcile me to an abode among thy deeply de&s;igning and treacherou&s;ly murderous inhabitants! I have forborne to narrate to my Clari&s;&s;a the &s;tory of my &s;i&s;ter's woes; her misfortunes were too &s;trongly marked with angui&s;h, to be impo&s;ed upon the exqui|&s;itely tender feelings of that &s;u&s;ceptible bo&s;om, which melts with &s;oft regrets at the tale of woe, and which has a &s;igh even for the common ills of life. Nay, tho&s;e deplorable circum&s;tances which hovered round the &s;teps of my ill-fated &s;i&s;ter, I have &s;edulou&s;ly &s;ought to blot even from my own memory. I would remem|ber only her virtues, her angel goodne&s;s, her beauteous image, and her &s;aint-like fortitude; but, alas! tho&s;e recollections are &s;o interwoven with the cruel events of her life, as to render a &s;eparation impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Orphanaged in her earlie&s;t bud; the &s;port of ca|price, malice and duplicity, through the un&s;u&s;pecting morn of life; and, in her marriage choice, placing her virtuous confidence in a man, who, by a &s;pecious exterior, villanou&s;ly deceived her; who wore the garb of integrity, honour, genero&s;ity, and a mild and con|ceding di&s;po&s;ition of &s;oul, on purpo&s;e to betray her ea&s;y faith; who no &s;ooner exchanged the nuptial vow, than throwing off the ma&s;k, and commencing tyrant, he became unweariedly ingenious in his devices to tor|ment the victim of his power; who per&s;ecuted her to the death, nor &s;u&s;pended, for a &s;ingle moment, his &s;av|age and dete&s;ted operations, until, with a broken heart, &s;he yielded up her breath, falling the martyr of a&s;&s;um|ed prerogative, cruelty and de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>Angelic &s;ufferer! mild and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, thou utter|ed no complaint; not a vindictive expre&s;&s;ion e&s;caped thee; and had thy murderer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but common pru|dence, the knowledge of thy unprecedented wrongs would have been con&s;igned to the grave with thee. Through all thy hard fortune, I followed &s;till an im|potent &s;pectator of thy injuries; but, while appearan|ces
<PB N="344" REF="034162_0343_0FFC688A063E53E0">
were pre&s;erved, cu&s;tom forbid a brother's interfer|ence, and an impeachment of thy hu&s;band's character would have been an incurable wound to thy delicacy. What &s;hall I further &s;ay? He who made her, regard|ing her with &s;acred pity, the pity of a God, her eman|cipation was accelerated, and &s;he drew her la&s;t breath in my arms! I &s;aw her lovely bo&s;om &s;urcea&s;e the corroding &s;igh; I &s;aw her heavenly form quietly di&s;|po&s;ed upon the bed of death; and, my Clari&s;&s;a, it was in that agonized moment, that I &s;evered from its kin|dred tre&s;&s;es, the &s;hining ringlet, which, &s;traying from its inclo&s;ure, fell uncon&s;cious upon her &s;nowy forehead.</P>
<P>I grieve that it hath been to you the &s;ource of in|quietude; but its value, at that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing period, ap|peared to me immen&s;e; nor has rea&s;on or time e&s;&s;en|tially depreciated its importance. I could never per|&s;uade my&s;elf to part with it to an arti&s;t, who would have o&s;ten&s;ibly returned it to me, in the form of cher|ubs, urns and in&s;criptions; for I have &s;till preferred contemplating its natural beauties; and I employed my fir&s;t &s;erene moments in preparing tho&s;e lines, in which to en&s;hrine it, that have been erroneou&s;ly called poetical. For the gratification of the curio&s;ity of your readers, Mr. Gleaner, I take leave to &s;ubjoin a copy of them:

Wi&s;dom pointed out the wretched &s;tate of inquietude, anxiety, nightly watch|ings, and daily fatigues, to which that unhappy and mi&s;guided wight is condemned, who, betrayed by an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> is allured from the humble vale of &s;oft and &s;ilent repo&s;e; from the calm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each &s;ocial and dome&s;tic enjoyment, to encounter the various ills attendant upon a pur&s;uit of <HI>artificial good.</HI> Wi&s;dom enumerated a ho&s;t of weary toils, of woe-begone re|grets, of unrecompen&s;ed deeds of worth, of thankle&s;s achievements, and of barbed di&s;appointments; and &s;he painted in glowing colours the ingratitude of that world to which I would madly devote tho&s;e hours, that might otherwi&s;e revolve, marked by the mo&s;t re|fined, rational and exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom delineated the thorny circles which begirt the hill of fame; &s;he bid me ha&s;te from the magic of her voice, from the mad contagion of her votaries; and, &s;heltering in the &s;weet and flowery walks of hu|mility, &s;he conjured me to embo&s;om my a&s;piring views in the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of my native &s;hades; and, that &s;he might forever da&s;h my proud preten&s;ions, and in|vigorate that de&s;pair, which, with icy gra&s;p, and tor|pid influence, hovered round my &s;teps, &s;he repre&s;ented in forms tremendou&s;ly terrific, tho&s;e deadly fiends, that with gha&s;tly features, and unrelenting rigour, eternal|ly guard the glittering domes of &s;ame.

&mdash;Malice, with tongue envenomed, armed with ten thou&s;and &s;hafts of in&s;tant death, and &s;miling at de&s;truc|tion&mdash;Pale di&s;appointment, marked by &s;orrow's train, with &s;ad and &s;olemn &s;tep, heaving corroding &s;ighs, quaffing her copious tears, and in de&s;pondence garbed&mdash;and, la&s;t of all, deep &s;hame, with face averted, eyes withdrawn, and red con&s;uming angui&s;h, confe&s;&s;ed thy power, heart appalling, &s;pirit wounding, &s;oul aba&s;hing &s;corn.

<P>Yet my a&s;piring mind, &s;teeled for the conflict, all in ar|mour clad, and &s;hielded by temerity&mdash;a&s;&s;uming re&s;o|lution, and armed by pertinacity, pre&s;umed with dar|ing &s;teps, and enterprizing ra&s;hne&s;s, to penetrate the embodied oppo&s;ition, <HI>and Rea&s;on plead in vain.</HI> Head|long ambition, all precepts notwith&s;tanding, continu|ed inflexibly per&s;evering, and triumphed in the con|flict. Ambition &s;elected its ornaments, and it wore on its left brea&s;t, clo&s;e to the heart, a bouquet, who&s;e per|fumed buds were, with intrepid daring, &s;natched from the &s;tock of ever blooming hope. In this it prided much, and fondly fancied that &s;ome future day, be|decked with &s;unny beams, would give the deathle&s;s flowre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s to enwreath its time di&s;tingui&s;hed, time adorn|ed brow. Thus breathing mid &s;uch odoriferous airs; incen&s;e &s;o &s;weet inhaling, intoxicated rea&s;on, treading enchanted ground, by magic &s;pells enfolded, and wrapped in gay delu&s;ion, its firmne&s;s lo&s;t&mdash;Ambition &s;eized the reins&mdash;the die was ca&s;t&mdash;and helter-&s;kelter round the world we drove.</P>
<P>But, &s;eriou&s;ly, although thus ra&s;hly embarked, <HI>judg|ment</HI> occa&s;ionally officiates; and while temerity &s;ets at the helm, <HI>&s;he</HI> often, matron like, interpo&s;es her cau|tionary directions, and to be duly influenced by her coun&s;els, is a prime object, even in the arrangements of ambition.</P>
<P>There is hardly any thing I have &s;o much feared, as the &s;ands of oblivion; and that I might produce a &s;tream of &s;ufficient depth to fleet my little &s;kiff, my

faculties, diligently exerci&s;ed, have been almo&s;t con|&s;tantly employed. Mankind have generally furni&s;h|ed my re&s;ervoir; and I have &s;et in the circles which I frequent, indu&s;triou&s;ly improving a hint, marking the &s;entiment of worth, catching every unwrought gem, and eagerly availing my&s;elf of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which I conceived I might <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> appropriate. Names I have been careful to conceal; and &s;tudiou&s;ly embel|i&s;hing events, and qualifying them to convey amu&s;e|ment, information, or even in&s;truction, I have produ|ced them as candidates for the attention of a vacant moment. Thus occupied, it will cea&s;e to be matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that I have trea&s;ured even the <HI>whi&s;pers</HI> of conver&s;ation; my ear is con&s;tantly on duty, and it hath proved to me a truly faithful &s;cout. Collected in my&s;elf, I am often regarded as a mute in &s;ociety; but I am careful to hoard every remark, and bearing the multifarious burden to my working hive, it under|goeth a chymical proce&s;s; and, after receiving in my pericranium the de&s;tined form, it is with all due hu|mility &s;ubmitted to public ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Thus Eugenio, if he will give his candour full play, may perceive, that without being the favourite confi|dante, "<HI>of all the young, hand&s;ome married women of my acquaintance,</HI>" I may, <HI>the loquacity of the &s;ex con&s;idered,</HI> legally become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>&s;ecrets,</HI> which are <HI>whi&s;pered to &s;elect friends,</HI> which are gathered from <HI>my&s;terious</HI> words, and which &s;ometimes re&s;ult from tho&s;e <HI>expre&s;|&s;ive</HI> looks, in which the <HI>female world</HI> are &s;uch proficients, and which they &s;o well know <HI>when to a&s;&s;ume.</HI> On the whole, while I have generally aimed at utility, I have &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavoured to avoid all occa&s;ion of offence; but if my hone&s;t intentions have not been crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to recal the pa&s;t, I can only a&s;&s;ure Eugenio, and every reader of his de&s;crip|tion, that I will be indefatigably indu&s;trious to render my future numbers le&s;s exceptionable.</P>

<P>"TAKE away this child," &s;aid the late benevo|lent Dr. Cooper, while &s;eated with the cele|brated Dr. Franklin, in a little retired breakfa&s;ting parlour&mdash;<Q>Take away this child&mdash;her que&s;tions inter|rupt our conver&s;ation, and are an impertinent intru|&s;ion upon the enjoyments of an hour, devoted to an entertainment of the highe&s;t kind.</Q> "Nay, nay," cried the philo&s;opher&mdash;<Q>let her &s;tay, let her &s;tay; &s;he is a &s;tranger in our world, and &s;he has a right to make her inquiries relative to the manners and cu&s;|toms of the people, among whom, the probability is, &s;he has many years to &s;ojourn.</Q></P>
<P>Men and women are too haughty, and form too ele|vated conceptions of the di&s;tance between them and the little race of mortals who are, <HI>for a &s;ea&s;on,</HI> their dependants. There is a freedom of acce&s;s, and a cha&s;|tized familiarity, which is very compatible with a due &s;pirit of government; but <HI>mild dignity</HI> is an a&s;&s;ociation too little known, and too rarely exemplified in the pre&s;|ent order of things.</P>
<P>The tru&s;t repo&s;ed in parents and preceptors, is in|deed important; the character of the ri&s;ing generation
<PB N="6" REF="034162_0352_0FFC6B2B61D88D00">
is in their gift, and the peace or anarchy of &s;ociety mu&s;t re&s;ult from them. When we con&s;ider how few parents are endowed by nature, or qualified by im|provement, for the judicious as di&s;charge of duties &s;o e&s;|&s;ential, we are almo&s;t ready to give our voice in favour of that plan, which, in a certain celebrated communi|ty, placed their youth under the tutelage of the State, commiting their education to per&s;ons deliberately cho|&s;en, and properly qualified for their high office. Yet, again&s;t this arrangement, the authority derived from the Father of the univer&s;e, forcibly pleads! The feel|ings of the parent indignantly revolt; and my right to direct my own child, is, in my own e&s;timation, unque&s;|tionable. Well then, there remains but one remedy&mdash;Let the cultivation of the minds of the man and woman, in miniature, be of that de&s;cription which will, in future, enable them to a&s;&s;ume with advantage, the guardian&s;hip of their de&s;cendants.</P>
<P>Much, in this momentous department, depends on <HI>female admini&s;tration;</HI> and the mother, or the woman to whom &s;he may delegate her office, will imprint on the opening mind, characters, ideas and conclu&s;ions, which time, in all its variety of vici&s;&s;itudes, will never be able to era&s;e.</P>
<P>Surely then, it is politic to be&s;tow upon the educa|tion of girls the mo&s;t exact attention: Let them be able to conver&s;e correctly and elegantly, (in their native &s;trains) with the children they may u&s;her into being; and, &s;ince the pronunciation is be&s;t fixed in the early part of life, let them be qualified to give the little pro|ficients a plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion of the French language; nor, it is conceived, ought it to be con&s;idered as <HI>un&s;exual,</HI> if they were capacitated to render the rudiments of the Latin tongue familiar. An acquaintance with hi&s;tory would capacitate mothers to &s;elect their nur&s;ery tales from tho&s;e tran&s;actions which have actually taken place upon our globe, and thus u&s;eful knowledge would &s;u|per&s;ede fairy legendary witches, and hob-goblins. Geography al&s;o might be introduced, and the little prattlers, by information that the great globe whereon
<PB N="7" REF="034162_0353_0FFC6B28F41EC600">
they move, has received the form of that orange which &s;o plea&s;ingly regales their palate, would, ere they were aware, be u&s;hered to the avenues of in&s;truction. A&s;|tronomy too may lend its aid; the blazing fire may repre&s;ent the &s;un, and the little bird revolving to its flame, on which they &s;o impatiently wait to fea&s;t, un|der the direction of the well informed and judicious tutore&s;s, may gradually account for light and heat, the grateful vici&s;&s;itudes of night and day, with the alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;ea&s;ons; and thus would the ta&s;k of the future preceptor be rendered ea&s;y, a thir&s;t for knowledge created, and the thre&s;hold of wi&s;dom &s;trewed with flowers.</P>
<P>But children commonly pa&s;s from the hands of their parents to that of their tutors at a very early period; and was I inve&s;ted with the powers of legi&s;la|tion, or was the gift of conferring honours mine, there is no order of citizens which I would &s;o liberally en|dow, and rai&s;e to &s;uch di&s;tinction, as tho&s;e individuals who devote them&s;elves to the education of youth. But then they &s;hould be per&s;ons unque&s;tionably qual|ified for their office, and entitled beyond all contro|ver&s;y to the approbation of their country. Arduous is the undertaking&mdash;the fir&s;t abilities are requi&s;ite&mdash;and it is impo&s;&s;ible to rate too high the worth of tho&s;e who are thus &s;uitably accompli&s;hed. Permit me, reader, to &s;ketch the outlines of the character of a Pre|ceptor whom I &s;hould delight to honour. Imagination this moment pre&s;ents him&mdash;he blends exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;i|bility with uniform patience&mdash;he is remarkably en|during&mdash;never ha&s;ty or impetuous&mdash;calmly deliberate in all his movements&mdash;carefully inve&s;tigating, nor ever inflicting puni&s;hments, but &s;uch as both in <HI>quantity</HI> and <HI>quality</HI> are righteou&s;ly due. <HI>He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth exten&s;ive knowledge of the &s;cience</HI> or <HI>&s;ciences which he teaches</HI>&mdash;he is free from every external blemi&s;h, and remarkable for no unfortunate &s;ingularity&mdash;his manners are elegant, and in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word de&s;criptive of the gentleman. He is celebrated for benevolence&mdash;he is an indi&s;putable philanthropi&s;t&mdash;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the hap|py
<PB N="8" REF="034162_0354_0FFC6B276D95C8D8">
&s;ecret of a&s;&s;imilating dignity and conde&s;cen&s;ion&mdash;his inborn integrity is undoubted, and he is ma&s;ter of &s;ufficient addre&s;s to obtain an entire a&s;cendency over the minds of his pupils&mdash;a &s;tranger to prejudice, he is, &s;trictly &s;peaking, impartial&mdash;and, to &s;ay all in one word, he embodies every virtue of which humanity is &s;u&s;ceptible: Nor is the &s;ketch too highly wrought, for it is a&s;&s;uredly true, that to accommodate the mind to the various di&s;po&s;itions to be found in a large &s;chool, and &s;o to under&s;tand the intellectual arrangement of each individual as to be capable of rendering him the important &s;ervices, which are nece&s;&s;ary, mu&s;t indi&s;pu|tably require every excellence, and the utmo&s;t perfec|tion of our nature.</P>
<P>The au&s;tere man can never be &s;ucce&s;sful; he will bani&s;h &s;miles from the face of that &s;ea&s;on which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> made for joy; and if the &s;tudent is not uncommonly endowed by nature, he will create in him an aver&s;ion to his book. Severity will always operate upon the opening mind, like the chilling bla&s;ts of winter upon the tender plant; it droops its blighted head, its pow|ers are rendered torpid, its &s;trength is pro&s;trated, and it is well, if the progre&s;&s;ing principle (if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s my&s;elf) which is at pre&s;ent latent, doth not be|come wholly extinct. Blows are the mo&s;t ea&s;y expe|dient, and are, perhaps for that rea&s;on, too often re&s;orted too&mdash;the <HI>ca&s;tigation of the boy, frequently gratifies the pa&s;&s;ions of the ma&s;ter,</HI> and he is &s;ometimes vindictive and inhuman in his puni&s;hments. If the giving a <HI>wrong &s;ound to a letter, or forgetting a &s;entence, is to be marked by blows&mdash;what re&s;ource, permit me to a&s;k, has the Preceptor in the event of capital crimes?</HI> A man who is him&s;elf free from error, or, which will have the &s;ame effect upon his pupils, who is &s;tudious to conceal his foibles from their knowledge, who is &s;olicitous to attach them to his per&s;on, and who carefully impre&s;&s;es an idea of his own affection toward them, who labours to obtain their confidence, and makes free u&s;e of that <HI>noble incentive, Prai&s;e</HI>&mdash;&s;uch a man will &s;eldom, I im|agine, find it nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to &s;everity;
<PB N="9" REF="034162_0355_0FFC6B25339287A8">
and it is inconte&s;tibly true, that puni&s;hments, <HI>e&s;pecial|ly blows,</HI> &s;hould be repeated as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible; for a&s;&s;uredly, nothing can be obtained by rendering the little offender <HI>callous, familiarizing him to di&s;grace, or bani&s;hing from his bo&s;om the hope of unblemi&s;hed reputation. The fir&s;t offences of children,</HI> whatever may be their na|ture, &s;hould invariably be con&s;idered as venial; and it would be always right, if practicable, to convict them <HI>without a witne&s;s</HI>&mdash;we cannot be too &s;olicitous to &s;pare them he <HI>fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lu&s;h of guilt; the &s;econd will not be &s;o deep,</HI> and they will too &s;oon leap the boundaries of inno|cence. I would <HI>affect</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e them incapable of the turpitude of a criminal action; and I would con&s;tantly repeat, while there remained the lea&s;t &s;hadow of prob|ability for &s;uch an avowal, that I was confident they would never <HI>deba&s;e</HI> them&s;elves by the infamy of delib|erate vice; thus, it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> that the fear of forfeiting our <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed good opinion</HI> would engage them <HI>&s;ilently to tread back the path they have reprehen&s;ibly entered.</HI></P>
<P>I remember, &s;ome time &s;ince, being greatly &s;hocked at receiving an account of an arrangement (which I would fain hope is &s;ingular) in a certain &s;chool of &s;ome celebrity, &s;ituated in one of our &s;ea-ports not far di&s;tant from the metropolis.

What has the little wretch to hope for under &s;uch tuition; after &s;uch a procedure, (labouring under the weight of a mo&s;t opprobrious verdict, and the victim of unwarrantable &s;everity) where will he find &s;pirits to pur&s;ue, with the requi&s;ite alacrity, his appointed &s;tud|ies? Or how can he advantageou&s;ly receive le&s;&s;ons from the mouth of him, who has thus unmercifully bli&s;tered his reputation? Are not the ill effects of this arrangement both upon the <HI>&s;chool in general, and the offender in particular,</HI> &s;ufficiently obvious? Is not undue degradation, envy, rancour, implacability, everla&s;ting, di&s;grace, and con&s;equent de&s;pair, thus &s;y&s;tematized, and embattled again&s;t that order, harmony, and im|provement, which would inevitably re&s;ult from the adoption of a mild &s;pirit of government?

the recovery of a beloved and notorious offender; and all who do, will not fail to applaud. It is, however, a melancholy truth, that the&s;e mild efforts will not always procure a reformation. But &s;urely, previous to a <HI>publication of di&s;grace,</HI> a con&s;ultation of parents or guardians &s;hould be obtained; and as tho&s;e deeply intere&s;ted characters ought invariably to <HI>coale&s;ce with the preceptors in whom they confide,</HI> no important &s;tep &s;hould be taken, without their knowledge and appro|bation. I am aware that this precludes the idea of <HI>&s;ecrecy</HI> in regard to &s;chool di&s;cipline; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I &s;eriou&s;ly wi&s;h the <HI>telling tales out of &s;chool,</HI> was no longer held up as a bug-bear to children, and that the terror it has &s;o long excited, was entirely aboli&s;hed. Rectitude &s;ubmitteth its admini&s;tration to the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny; the more it is known, the more it is admir|ed; and the arrangements of equity &s;oliciteth inquiry.</P>
<P>The magnitude of my &s;ubject, bars the &s;uppo&s;ition that it can be too warmly expatiated upon. Children, I in&s;i&s;t, &s;hould be brought forward with gentlene&s;s. The wi&s;e king of I&s;rael was not <HI>always wi&s;e;</HI> and when he is found &s;o <HI>petulantly</HI> exclaiming, "<HI>Spare the rod and &s;poil the child,</HI>" the probability is, that, crowded upon by the <HI>ill-regulated offspring of his illicit and multifarious amours,</HI> he had lo&s;t that balance of equanimity, which is &s;o proper to the philo&s;opher. The tutor &s;hould nev|er be permitted to act the part of a de&s;pot; he &s;hould ever be free of acce&s;s, and while he uniformly pre|&s;erves a mild &s;pirit of government, the pupil, under proper regulations, &s;hould be permitted a &s;ufficient lat|itude of inquiry.</P>
<P>Every anxious parent experiences the difficulty of obtaining a preceptor, to whom he can confide the care of his children. But if the emoluments of the office were proportioned to the &s;olicitude and impor|tance of the undertaking, if it was more honorary, and if there were greater di&s;tinctions annexed thereto, an adequate number of candidates, of meritorious candi|dates, would pre&s;ent. Countle&s;s advantages would

accrue to families, and con&s;equences the mo&s;t benefi|cial, would re&s;ult to the community at large.</P>
<P>The ancients, we are told, formed &s;uch ju&s;t ideas of the nature and momentous con&s;equences of education, as to e&s;teem the cultivation of the minds of their young people among their mo&s;t dignified offices; and per|&s;ons of the fir&s;t con&s;ideration, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing affluence, and obtaining general confidence, engaged in the arduous ta&s;k, delighting to employ them&s;elves in &s;haping the principles, and pointing the views, of tho&s;e who were to &s;ucceed them in the great drama of life. And was not this perfectly right? The good preceptor is of cour&s;e ennobled; and no ju&s;t rea&s;on can be given why he &s;hould not take rank in the highe&s;t grade of the community. For my own part, I again repeat, that deliberate reflection upon the nature of his duties, and the magnitude of tho&s;e effects which frequently de|pend upon his regency, has con&s;trained me to regard him as more con&s;equential, and of higher importance, than even the authority which is con&s;tituted &s;upreme in any country; nay, further, that &s;chool dame, redu|ced by adver&s;e circum&s;tances to confer the rudiments of in&s;truction, and to call into action the latent &s;eeds of worth, is of more value (&s;uppo&s;ing &s;he judiciou&s;ly and faithfully performs the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in her) in the great &s;cale of excellence, than &s;he, who, from con&s;ider|ations of wealth or beauty, receives the adulation of gathering crowds. This is an obvious truth, ina&s;|much as it is the exertions of the tutore&s;s, &s;ucceeded by the more exten&s;ive operations of the preceptor, that will render ea&s;y the &s;eat of the magi&s;trate, and &s;uper|cede the nece&s;&s;ity of coercive interpo&s;ition, giving uni|ver&s;al order to take place, as naturally as the hours &s;ucceed each other, or as the ble&s;&s;ings of light proceed from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rb of day. From whence is derived the fe|licity of families? Undoubtedly from a due regulation of the individuals of which they are compo&s;ed, and particularly from a proper arrangement of the young people who con&s;titute &s;uch important parts thereof. From what &s;ource re&s;ults the well-being of the great
<PB N="13" REF="034162_0359_0FFC6B1AB75B6EB8">
body of the people? Indi&s;putably from the informa|tion, correct movements, and order of its members. And is not the due qualification of teachers, and the faithful di&s;charge of the duties of their office, the broad and &s;olid ba&s;is, on which is erected the &s;uper&s;tructure of what&s;oever is nece&s;&s;ary in the economy of private life, public u&s;efulne&s;s, or general celebrity?

<P>"GOOD Mr. Gleaner," &s;aid a rural friend of mine, <Q>I think you <HI>lo&s;e ground</HI> by the prolixity of your numbers; and, to &s;ay truth, you often remind me of Farmer Straggleford, who whim&s;ically erect|ed a number of huge enormous granaries, which, when completed, remained monuments of his o&s;ten|tation, for having rendered him&s;elf, by his prodig|ious exertions, and the exten&s;ivene&s;s of his plans, an in&s;olvent debtor; his buildings, of cour&s;e, contain nothing of value, indeed they are nearly unoccupied, and he is regarded as a poor bankrupt, who has been the fabricator of his own <HI>con&s;picuous in&s;ignificancy.</HI> Now, had neighbour Straggleford contented him|&s;elf with a &s;nug little barn, he might have kept his grounds, and, &s;toring it every year with the ripened produce of the &s;ea&s;on, he might&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="034162_0360_0FFC6B17F085A568">
Say no more, Brother Thrifty, cried I&mdash;&s;ay no more; I perfectly under&s;tand you, although it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed your illu&s;tration is rather far fetched; yet, tru&s;t me, it &s;hall be my endeavour in future to circum&s;cribe, as much as po&s;&s;ible, my excur&s;ive rambles; and agree|able to this determination I abridge a number of &s;heets, that I had entitled an e&s;&s;ay on education, confining my&s;elf to a few ob&s;ervations, which I mo&s;t unfeigned|ly wi&s;h may be duly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion whether private or public education is of the mo&s;t general utility, has agitated the minds, and employed the pens, of many ingenious writers; but the &s;ubject, as far as I am informed, &s;till remains prob|lematical; nor &s;hall I arrogantly pretend to decide where tho&s;e Doctors of literature &s;o widely di&s;agree. Yet the Gleaner, without incurring the charge of temer|ity, may perhaps be permitted to a&s;k whether it would not be wi&s;dom to defer the choice of public or private tuition, until the di&s;po&s;ition of the child is a&s;certained? The mode&s;t, diffident mind, may &s;tand in need of all tho&s;e &s;timulatives that are in the gift of a large &s;chool. Retiring efforts are often rou&s;ed to action by emula|tion; and that fame which a con&s;picuous &s;ituation fre|quently confers, may at once allure, and give a mo|tive to ambition. There are minds, peculiarly attu|ned to all the &s;en&s;ibilities, which are at once the ce|ment, the ornament, and the &s;ource of tho&s;e gentler virtues that connect, that meliorate, and that actuate beings who combine, and who are formed to cultivate the endearing charities, the elegancies, and the ble&s;|&s;ings of &s;ocial life. To accommodate an intellect of this de&s;cription to the multifarious and frequently di&s;|cordant &s;cenes that are to be encountered in a world, where ill-judged a&s;perities too often wound the exqui|&s;itely delicate feelings of &s;u&s;ceptibility, a various and exten&s;ive intercour&s;e with mankind may be nece&s;&s;ary. But the boy, who&s;e bold a&s;piring temper precipitates him upon an undue a&s;&s;umption of importance, who &s;uddenly ru&s;hes forward to tho&s;e di&s;tinctions, which are only proper to maturity; &s;uch a boy, methinks, &s;hould
<PB N="15" REF="034162_0361_0FFC6B155506B0C0">
receive the checks of retirement; &s;hould be formed to knowledge and to virtue, amid the &s;hades of &s;eque&s;|tered life; care being taken to furni&s;h him with tho&s;e views, which may gradually accu&s;tom him to a proper e&s;timation of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>My wi&s;hes, relative to the in&s;truction of young peo|ple, compri&s;e every thing which can be con&s;idered as u&s;eful or ornamental; but I am e&s;pecially &s;olicitous, that they &s;hould be made <HI>critically</HI> acquainted with that language, in which they are de&s;tined to <HI>conver&s;e, tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>adju&s;t their plea&s;urable pur&s;uits.</HI> Some of my acquaintance have made greater profi|ciency in many branches of &s;tudy, than in their mother tongue; and I know per&s;ons who can pa&s;s rapidly through a Latin author, who cannot ea&s;ily trace the lineage or de&s;cription of the &s;everal parts of &s;peech in their native Engli&s;h; who cannot readily decline a noun; who he&s;itate with re&s;pect to the ca&s;es nomina|tive, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ive, and objective; and who are at a lo&s;s to follow the verb through number, per&s;on, mood, and ten&s;e.</P>
<P>Latidius &s;hould be a good Latin &s;cholar; he has received the honours of a univer&s;ity; and yet it is a fact, that Latidius cannot write a billet, in which an Engli&s;h grammarian will not be able to point out, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, as many errors as there are lines! Is Latidius cen&s;urable for this deficiency? Perhaps he is much le&s;s &s;o than tho&s;e who had the direction of his education. Great care was taken to u&s;her him into the world, perfectly accompli&s;hed in every requi&s;ite except his vernacular tongue; but, while engaged in the &s;tudy of the <HI>dead languages,</HI> he was never taught a due deference for, or proper e&s;timation of, his own:</P>
<P>I &s;hould not be &s;atisfied, if my &s;ons and daughters did not &s;peak, read, and write Engli&s;h, <HI>grammatically, critically,</HI> and even <HI>elegantly.</HI> Perhaps the accurate ob|&s;erver may, at this moment, &s;hrewdly remark&mdash;<HI><Q>Sure|ly, be who takes upon him&s;elf the character of Dictator, or arrogantly a&s;&s;umes the &s;eat of the Cen&s;or, ought to be per|fectly free from the errors which he condemns.</Q></HI> This i&s;
<PB N="16" REF="034162_0362_0FFC6B12F388F670">
a&s;&s;uredly true; and, to the well-meaning and candid objector, I calmly an&s;wer&mdash;<HI>I have no where propo&s;ed my|&s;elf as a model: It may be, that I am experimentally qual|ified to de&s;cant upon the di&s;advantages attendant upon early inattention. For aught thou knowe&s;t, the Gleaner may have been doomed to the toil&s;ome drudgery of gleaning his information, when years, dimini&s;hing the flexibility of the mental faculties, have rendered it difficult for them to re|ceive impre&s;&s;ions;</HI> and, if I am thus circum&s;tanced, I may be allowed to delineate the inconveniences of, and energetically to lament a deficiency from which I &s;o e&s;&s;entially &s;uffer. Admitting, I &s;ay, this to be the ca&s;e, I may, with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety and the utmo&s;t con&s;i&s;tency, proceed to point out the &s;hoals which too often impede, and frequently wholly arre&s;t my progre&s;s.</P>
<P>One thing is certain; for the ri&s;ing generation, the devout ori&s;ons of my &s;pirit are daily breathed. I have written <HI>primarily</HI> for my amu&s;ement&mdash;Truth is my pole &s;tar&mdash;I would contribute my mite to benefit my fellow-mortals&mdash;I have not de&s;igned ill&mdash;and, if I err, I hum|bly entreat tho&s;e who confer on my pages the honour of a peru&s;al, to impute my errors rather to my head than to my heart.</P>
<P>The modern literati are generally &s;ufficiently liberal in the eulogies which they be&s;tow on the ancients; and, as <HI>imitation</HI> is commonly the offspring of <HI>admiration,</HI> is it not wonderful, they do not more frequently tread in their &s;teps? Neither the Greeks nor the Romans in|cumbered them&s;elves with a variety of tongues; their own language always obtained a ju&s;t <HI>pre-eminence,</HI> and never failed of engaging their earlie&s;t and mo&s;t unre|mitted application. The re&s;ult was, natural children were qualified to conver&s;e, and to expre&s;s them&s;elves on paper, with elegance and accuracy; they were in|itiated, in the morning of their days, into an acquaint|ance with all the varieties of grammar; they could de|lineate the &s;everal parts of &s;peech; the intricacies of their language were rendered familiar to their under|&s;tandings; they were capable of determining its com|pa&s;s,
<PB N="17" REF="034162_0363_0FFC6B116EBA5378">
and of analyzing every &s;entence; they could, with the greate&s;t preci&s;ion, re&s;olve each component word, placing it under its original head or de&s;cription; And hence, it is &s;aid, (and the conjecture is founded in rea&s;on) proceeded tho&s;e works of <HI>educated genius,</HI> which have &s;tood the te&s;t of time, extorting a tribute of applau&s;e from every &s;ucceeding generation.</P>
<P>If I mi&s;take not, (and upon this occa&s;ion I do what I &s;eldom do&mdash;tru&s;t to the tenacity of my memory) there were periods, when the Romans, mea&s;uring the importance of their language by the dignity of their rational character, <HI>di&s;dained the &s;tudy even of the Greek tongue.</HI> Victors are fond of impo&s;ing their laws, their cu&s;toms, and their language; and the univer&s;al preva|lence of any particular mode of &s;peech, would be one &s;tep toward the introduction of univer&s;al dominion. National attachment &s;hould, therefore, dictate the &s;tu|dious cultivation of a national language; and it may be worthy the exertions of an enlightened legi&s;lature, to erect a &s;tandard, to rai&s;e, to dignify, to perfect, and to poli&s;h a common tongue.</P>
<P>Is the &s;tudent de&s;igned for the profe&s;&s;ion of any par|ticular art or &s;cience, a vernacular language mu&s;t be the vehicle of his ideas. Gentlemen at the bar de|liver their harangues in their mother tongue; in na|tive &s;trains they addre&s;s the impannelled jury, and ju&s;|tice frequently hangs upon their forcible, intelligent, and well con&s;tructed periods. The &s;acred Orator ad|dre&s;&s;es his li&s;tening audience in familiar accents. The Repre&s;entatives of our free, &s;overeign and independ|ent States&mdash;Senators enrobed with power&mdash;Chief Ju&s;|tices delivering their &s;olemn charges&mdash;and our augu&s;t Pre&s;ident, the Patriot WASHINGTON, inve&s;ted with all that authority which <HI>virtuous liberty</HI> can confer, with every intervening grade&mdash;are all found delivering their &s;entiments, and arre&s;ting attention, in the well known &s;ounds which de&s;ignate the Engli&s;h tongue.</P>
<P>Letters are indi&s;putably the elements of language; and the due arrangement, and fit con&s;truction of tho&s;e words which they compo&s;e, is the broad ba&s;is on which
<PB N="18" REF="034162_0364_0FFC6B0E59540DF8">
towers the arts and &s;ciences, forming, in their &s;everal orders, a &s;uper&s;tructure replete with elegance, beauty and u&s;efulne&s;s. It is from this &s;ource that the orator mu&s;t draw his materials; poets too &s;ubmit to its ad|mea&s;urement; and the grave hi&s;torian mu&s;t be tried by its rules. Indeed, an early acquaintance with the nature, con&s;truction and latitude of a vernacular lan|guage, is of &s;uch importance to every cla&s;s of people, that it is wonderful there &s;hould be found parents and preceptors who can pre&s;erve their equanimity, while con&s;cious that tho&s;e committed to their charge are, in this truly e&s;&s;ential part of education, almo&s;t totally neglected.</P>
<P>The train of reflections introduced by my &s;ubject, at this moment pre&s;ents to my mind a per&s;on, who is now &s;uffering much from this unnatural omi&s;&s;ion; and, as examples often enforce conviction more effectually than general remarks, I pre&s;ent him by way of illu&s;|tration.</P>
<P>Leontius, born in the mid&s;t of affluence, was nur&s;ed in the lap of plenty; and being the only &s;on of de&s;erv|ing parents, who were generally judicious in their ar|rangements, his education was regarded as a matter of the greate&s;t moment. No expen&s;e was &s;pared; and his preceptors were rewarded for their exertions not only with a liberal, but with a lavi&s;h hand. He had hardly completed his &s;ixth year, when it was judged nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould commence his &s;tudies of the Latin tongue; and from that moment, hurried on from one &s;tage of erudition to another, no portion of time was found to attend to his progre&s;s in that language, from which he was in a great mea&s;ure to derive his future re&s;pectability. It was ab&s;urdly &s;uppo&s;ed, (if indeed it ever obtained a place in the reflections of either pa|rents or tutor) that Engli&s;h would be a matter of cour&s;e; and thus the boy was left to form unto him&s;elf a &s;tyle, ju&s;t as whim or caprice might direct. For a place at a celebrated &s;eminary he was early pre&s;ented a candidate; his acceptation was full and honorary&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e pa&s;&s;ed through the univer&s;ity, attending the accu&s;|tomed
<PB N="19" REF="034162_0365_0FFC6B0B12A2B4C8">
routine of in&s;truction, and, enriched with aca|demical applau&s;e, he received his fir&s;t degree. Thus endowed, he made his <HI>entr&eacute;e</HI> upon &s;ociety, better quali|fied to figure in any walk than as an Engli&s;h &s;cholar. Without arrogating the gift of prophecy, it was ea&s;y to predict an event, which was preci&s;ely that which rea&s;on would have calculated. Awkward and untaught, his education had in effect produced him a &s;tranger to tho&s;e &s;cenes in which he was hourly called upon to take a part. If he a&s;&s;ayed the, to him, arduous ta&s;k of entertaining his friends with an Engli&s;h book, fal&s;e pronunciation, empha&s;is, and accent, were vi&s;ible in every paragraph; comma's a&s;&s;umed the di&s;tinction of full &s;tops, while the finely turned period lo&s;t all its beauty: Colons, &s;emicolons, notes of interrogation and admiration, the&s;e were all promi&s;cuou&s;ly huddled together; and while by one continued monotony of &s;ound, ideas were jumbled, and the auditory nerve di&s;|gu&s;ted, it was in vain that his hearers fatigued them&s;elves by an expectation of the &s;entiment of an author. Har|monious accents, delicate inflexions of voice, and that animation, or energetic propriety, which is the vehi|cle of intelligence&mdash;of the&s;e he had no idea; he &s;eem|ed in effect the determined foe of good reading, and he ought to have been arraigned as the murderer of &s;en&s;e. Candour would, however, have appeared as his advocate; and &s;he might truly have &s;pecified, that &s;uch erroneous conclu&s;ions had obtained in his bo&s;om, as taught him to regard every thing <HI>merely Engli&s;h</HI> with a &s;en&s;ation bordering upon contempt; and, &s;he would have added, that he had been unavoidably pre|cipitated upon the&s;e conclu&s;ions, by the total &s;ilence of his preceptors. As a writer, too, Leontius is highly deficient; and a girl who is dependent upon her nee|dle for her &s;upport, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he has been properly educated, ought to blu&s;h if &s;he could not &s;urpa&s;s him in the correctne&s;s of her epi&s;tolary productions.</P>
<P>Yet it was expected that our young gentleman would attain eminence, de&s;erve well of his country, and make his way to popularity among a race of beings who
<PB N="20" REF="034162_0366_0FFC6B0990063BE0">
&s;poke, wrote, declaimed, and tran&s;acted their commer|cial concerns, altogether in Engli&s;h. Leontius was bred to no bu&s;ine&s;s; he was, as has been intimated, born to high pecuniary expectations, and it was pre&s;umed that his natural and acquired abilities would rai&s;e him to di&s;tinction. His exterior is dignified and prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing; and, notwith&s;tanding his deficiencies as an En|gli&s;h &s;cholar, high ideas of his literature are entertain|ed. He early wedded the di&s;creet and beautiful Hen|rietta, and &s;oon became the father of a family; his parents and the friends of his youth have &s;unk into the grave, and misfortunes have robbed him of that patrimony, which, in the warmth of a youthful imag|ination, he had calculated as exhau&s;tle&s;s.</P>
<P>For Leontius what now remains? Education hath unfitted him for the preceptor of his own children&mdash;he is unqualified for every thing that is <HI>&s;imply Engli&s;h;</HI> and while nature has endowed him with abilities which might capacitate him to become the bard, the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, or even the hi&s;torian of his country, education inter|po&s;es its effectual barriers.</P>
<P>The want of an early and critical knowledge of a vernacular tongue, is deeply felt by a writer; an em|ployment, which might otherwi&s;e be advantageous and plea&s;ing, becomes real drudgery, and the experience of per&s;ons thus circum&s;tanced, will oblige them to confe&s;s that it is &s;omething late to begin the &s;tudy of a lan|guage, after the age of adole&s;cence hath pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>Nece&s;&s;ity, however, hath called into action the facul|ties of Leontius; &s;ome beautiful e&s;&s;ays, with infinite labour, he hath completed; but he blu&s;hes at every line, le&s;t the critic &s;hould detect him in doing violence to the &s;ubtleties of grammar; and each revolving day witne&s;&s;es his lamentations that he was not early taught his mother tongue.</P>
<P>I condemn not the exten&s;ive &s;tudies in which our youth are engaged&mdash;far from it&mdash;French, Latin, Italian, and whatever el&s;e the under&s;tanding can attain, the&s;e are all little enough; but while my mind continues under the dominion of rea&s;on, I &s;hall ever contend for a de|cided
<PB N="21" REF="034162_0367_0FFC6B07349F8EC0">
preference as indi&s;putably due to the mother tongue; and under this per&s;ua&s;ion the nece&s;&s;ity of en|treating parents, guardians and preceptors of every de&s;cription, continually to bear in mind what country is de&s;tined the theatre of action to tho&s;e committed to their care, becomes apparent.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h language is by inheritance ours. It is that in which we fir&s;t breathe forth our filial grati|tude; in tho&s;e &s;entences which it compri&s;es, we mani|fe&s;t our family attachments&mdash;expre&s;s our amities&mdash;&s;hape our devotional ori&s;ons&mdash;tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;form the mo&s;t tender of all ties&mdash;addre&s;s an infant family&mdash;fa&s;h|ion the lives and manners of that family&mdash;and, final|ly, embody that la&s;t &s;olemn adieu, which is to precede our exit from the pre&s;ent to a higher order of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The advantage of acquitting our&s;elves, on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, with propriety, mu&s;t be obvious to every thinking mind; and the Gleaner imagines he can hardly be too importunate on a &s;ubject of &s;uch magnitude.</P>

"<HI>Fear not, gen|tle reader&mdash;by virtue of the patriarchal dignity which I have a&s;&s;umed, I will, upon a proper occa&s;ion, grant unto the &s;aid Serafina Clifford, a full and free ab&s;olution from this her incon&s;iderate vow, which I &s;hall take care to impute to the irre&s;i&s;table influence of an impa&s;&s;ioned moment.</HI>"</P>
<P>Now I &s;ay, Mr. Vigillius, if you do in reality po&s;|&s;e&s;s &s;uch a power, and if you will ab&s;olutely and <HI>bona fide</HI> clear Mi&s;s Clifford, and the heirs lawfully born of her body, <HI>from all claims what&s;oever, which the Ham|iltons may, on any future emergency, find it convenient to lay to her e&s;tate, I will pa&s;s over the queer manner of her birth,</HI> and the odd way in which her true father con|trived to &s;muggle her into his family, and &s;he &s;hall forthwith become my <HI>true</HI> and <HI>lawful</HI> wife <HI>until death.</HI> You know, friend Vigillius, there are &s;ome men of not <HI>half my property,</HI> who would be more <HI>&s;queami&s;h;</HI> but &s;o that I do but &s;ecure the <HI>main chance,</HI> I will not lo&s;e a bargain, although its in&s;trument may not chance to be &s;tampt with other people's ideas of legitimacy, and all that. To &s;ay truth, I think I cannot do better than to enter into your family; and, as you &s;eem to have &s;o much authority over Mi&s;s Clifford, (and &s;he is now, by all account, the &s;i&s;ter-in-law of Mrs. Hamilton) I con&s;ider her all one as a girl of yours; and being more and more determined to marry, I am in down|right earne&s;t in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I have lately lo&s;t a &s;i&s;ter, who, though &s;he was what is commonly called an old maid, was neverthele&s;s a very good hou&s;e-wife, and managed my matters <HI>to a fraction; nothing was lo&s;t,</HI> and every <HI>penny</HI> was di&s;po&s;ed

<SALUTE>OLD FELLOW,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM willing to believe, as you &s;ay, that your girl was ab&s;olutely di&s;po&s;ed of, before you received my let|ter, making known my de&s;igns in regard to her; and I can tell you, old Gentleman, it is well for you that I am&mdash;yes, Sir, <HI>it is well for you that I am</HI>&mdash;for I am connected with a &s;et of high-blooded blades, every in|dividual of whom, have all rea&s;onable attachment to my per&s;on and my intere&s;t; and we are, moreover, bound to each other, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements, to aid and abet each other, upon all occa&s;ions, and to render to every member of our invincible community all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and 'fore gad, old Square Toes,
<PB N="27" REF="034162_0373_0FFC6AF69FF503D8">
if you had not given unequivocal demon&s;tration, that your Margaretta was ab&s;olutely and <HI>bona fide</HI> &s;hackled, before you was apprized of the <HI>honour I intended her,</HI> we would have made nothing of <HI>to&s;&s;ing your Wor&s;hip in a blanket,</HI> and of leaving you, after your a&euml;rial eleva|tion, hand&s;omely &s;ou&s;ed in the fir&s;t hor&s;e-pond in our way. I give you this information for your future government; and, as I have a new propo&s;al to make, I expect it will be properly influential. Do not deceive your&s;elf, good Mr. Prig, with an idea, that the para|doxical my&s;teries, in which you have contrived to wrap your&s;elf about, will much longer avail you; for Dick Blu&s;ter, Tom Pompous, Ned Mettle&s;ome, and the re&s;t of us, are expert at finding out the &s;ecret haunts of you <HI>&s;ly ones;</HI> and we are, moreover, whatever you may think of it, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a <HI>clue to your ca&s;tle, which will lead us directly upon the ground,</HI> and we are both able and willing to turn <HI>knight-errants, to &s;torm enchant|ed ca&s;tles, fight magicians, and deliver all the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed dam&s;els, who may be &s;ound within the territory of the United States.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you are forewarned, and if you are but fore|armed, that is, if the weapons of your warfare are not carnal, but &s;piritual; if you enli&s;t only under the banners of rea&s;on, we may adju&s;t matters amicably enough. Serafina Clifford is a fine girl, by Jupiter&mdash;my intentions are honourable matrimony, and Mi&s;s Clifford is my object; for although her <HI>birth is not quite the thing,</HI> yet &s;he is a good generous girl; and as &s;he appears to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>ready,</HI> I very glad|ly make a transfer of my <HI>penchant</HI> for her little meek &s;i&s;ter to her fair &s;elf; and I expect &s;he will not find much difficulty in &s;ub&s;tituting as her heir apparent, a gay, hand&s;ome young fellow, in&s;tead of the little chap of whom &s;he has appeared &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately fond&mdash;her hu&s;band will very naturally &s;ucceed to her <HI>affections,</HI> and all her other <HI>goods</HI> and <HI>chattels;</HI> and if &s;he continues her fondne&s;s for the &s;miling brats, <HI>y'clepped the comforts of matrimony,</HI> I may po&s;&s;ibly furni&s;h her with a plen|ty of them, while &s;he, continuing to &s;upply me with

the <HI>ready,</HI> we &s;hall thus very hand&s;omely reciprocate obligations.</P>
<P>But, in the mean time, as I have already been fool|i&s;h enough to inform you that my e&s;tate was a little embarra&s;&s;ed, and as her &s;age brother may not be over and above fond of the &s;crapes into which that mi&s;erly and de&s;potic old curmudgeon, Poverty, is &s;o ungen|tlemanly as to lead the &s;ubjects of his ragged empire; he may probably think it becomes him to make a few pragmatical inquiries, and as I do not wi&s;h to be at odds with the brother of my &s;pou&s;e elect, you may in|form Edward Hamilton, that I have a hand&s;ome e&s;tate in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; it is true, it is encumbered with a few mortgages, but the <HI>ready,</HI> which I take it for granted the young lady has in her gift, will ea&s;ily clear off all the&s;e, and we &s;hall then be as hand&s;ome and as fa&s;hionable a pair, as any of the gay circles in or about town can produce. But Edward is a &s;ober dog&mdash;Well, hang it, &s;o am I&mdash;and all this I am able and willing to demon&s;trate at whatever moment, and in whatever place, you and brother Hamilton may appoint.

<P>Lord, Lord!&mdash;if I had but been &s;uffered to take the <HI>command of my own &s;hip</HI>&mdash;but not a <HI>rope have I veer|ed out,</HI> without orders fir&s;t had and obtained from <HI>lub|bers</HI> who never yet under&s;tood <HI>plain &s;ailing,</HI> and who are, over and above, forever <HI>fi&s;hing in troubled waters.</HI> A thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times have I told Deborah Seafort what her <HI>yaws</HI> and her <HI>veerings</HI> would bring her to; and, &s;ure as St. Peter's at Rome, &s;he hath now run <HI>fa&s;t a-ground</HI> upon a <HI>lee &s;hore,</HI> and here we mu&s;t remain, <HI>wearing</HI> our <HI>&s;ides,</HI> and <HI>beating,</HI> mayhap, again&s;t the <HI>rocks,</HI> if you, Sir, who &s;eem to know ev|ery <HI>rope in the &s;hip,</HI> do not <HI>lend a hand</HI> to help us off. You mu&s;t know, that when, by the orders of our <HI>&s;elf-created</HI> captain, Deborah Seafort, we <HI>crowded every &s;ail</HI> for the land of matrimony, as we had a <HI>gallant &s;hip</HI> under foot, we fooli&s;hly enough hung out ever &s;o ma|ny &s;treamers; and, not having taken on board a &s;uf|ficient quantity of balla&s;t, we &s;hipped, in lieu thereof, &s;uch a cargo of <HI>&s;elf-conceit, affectation, prim-o&s;ity,</HI> and
<PB N="30" REF="034162_0376_0FFC6AEFA6668160">
other femalities, as rendered us &s;o <HI>crank,</HI> that we were many a time within <HI>an ame's-ace</HI> of over&s;etting.</P>
<P>But, mayhap, Mr. Gleaner, if you have never ploughed the ocean, you may not under&s;tand the&s;e &s;ea terms; and &s;o, <HI>d'ye &s;ee,</HI> I will endeavour <HI>for to let my|&s;elf down</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible. Why, you mu&s;t know, that our girl Molly&mdash;for may I receive the <HI>cat-o' nine-tail upon my beam timbers,</HI> in pre&s;ence of the whole &s;hip's crew, if I ever call her Mary, or Maria, again.&mdash;I &s;ay, Mr. Gleaner, our girl Molly, being a good tight little hu&s;&s;y, and, withal, hand&s;omely <HI>built, rigged,</HI> and, though I &s;ay it that &s;hould not &s;ay it, <HI>properly &s;ound,</HI> was judged a fit match for any <HI>&s;ea-boat</HI> whatever. I did not, as I have hinted above, like her manner of &s;ailing, or the way which &s;he made. Frequently has &s;he flung out <HI>fal&s;e colours,</HI> and after bringing to her lure many a <HI>gallant &s;ail,</HI> &s;he has <HI>up jibb,</HI> and borne away, quite in another direction. This I have pro|nounced da&s;tardly, and have thought fit to enter my prote&s;t; but I have been charged with fomenting a mutiny, and <HI>belayed</HI> fa&s;t in the cabin, or the &s;hip's hold, as a meddling, dangerous and officious fellow. You will under&s;tand, that I &s;peak by way of metaphor, &s;imile, or the like of that. It is in vain that I have, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, run over a whole catalogue of &s;ea oaths, that has frightened many a Jack Tar into obedience. The women, as they &s;ay, have got harden|ed to them, and they do not value them a <HI>rope's end!</HI> Deborah was above con&s;ulting her compa&s;s, and I have looked every moment when we &s;hould <HI>&s;plit to pieces.</HI> At length they have &s;prung a ma&s;t, and, entirely igno|rant of their <HI>chart,</HI> and not knowing which way to <HI>wear the &s;hip,</HI> and being brought to their wit's end, they have conde&s;cended to place me at <HI>the helm.</HI> But, Mr. Gleaner, this being a kind of navigation at which I am not expert, I am much in the &s;ame &s;ituation of your land-lubbers, who find them&s;elves at &s;ea in a &s;torm; and I am, as it were, obliged to bend my cour&s;e to the <HI>harbour of your experience:</HI> You have erected a <HI>beacon,</HI> and if you can but <HI>warp us out</HI> of the pre&s;ent
<PB N="31" REF="034162_0377_0FFC6AEE232F2808">
difficult &s;trait, in which we are <HI>becalmed,</HI> you &s;hall be our <HI>land mark</HI> in future.</P>
<P>It goes to the heart of me, Mr. Gleaner, to &s;ee our Molly opening the &s;luices of her eye-pumps, and pour|ing forth &s;uch a torrent of &s;alt-water &s;orrow. You mu&s;t know, Sir, that after &s;he had kept <HI>at bay ever &s;o many pickeroons,</HI> &s;he was at la&s;t brought to, by a &s;mart, well-built <HI>brigantine,</HI> who &s;eemed to under&s;tand every point of the compa&s;s, who was wonderfully <HI>trim,</HI> and fur|bi&s;hed out to the be&s;t advantage. Molly, knowing how to calculate her own force, would not immediate|ly <HI>&s;trike,</HI> and, to &s;ay truth, our &s;park rather played <HI>fa&s;t</HI> and <HI>loo&s;e,</HI> as the &s;aying is&mdash;not choo&s;ing to come to an open parley. How&s;omever, he contrived, <HI>d'ye &s;ee,</HI> to be con&s;tantly in <HI>the girl's wake;</HI> if ever &s;he hoi&s;ted &s;ail, he was &s;ure to follow, and like the old Roman Mark Anthony, who we read of at &s;chool&mdash;who, by the bye, was as little of a <HI>&s;ailor</HI> as a <HI>&s;oldier</HI>&mdash;he &s;eemed to think the <HI>world well lo&s;t for our Cleopatra.</HI> Well, but after Molly had &s;tood out <HI>many gla&s;&s;es,</HI> Deborah, who is as <HI>yare</HI> as any old &s;ea-boat need to be, having the watch, and having, as &s;he &s;aid, thoroughly overhauled the <HI>lifts</HI> and the <HI>braces, the clew-lines</HI> and &s;he <HI>buntlines;</HI> hav|ing <HI>top't her yards,</HI> and d'ye &s;ee, got every thing in read|ine&s;s, thought proper to heave out a <HI>white flag,</HI> by way of concluding upon terms of capitulation. But no &s;ooner had we begun to <HI>veer</HI> out our <HI>fa&s;ts.</HI> than, zounds, Mr. Gleaner&mdash;for, d'ye &s;ee, it is enough to make the be&s;t mini&s;ter in the United States &s;wear&mdash;if the cow|ardly, ra&s;cally pickeroon, did not <HI>&s;lip his cable,</HI> and &s;heer off, when, hoi&s;ting every &s;ail, he was nearly out of &s;ight before we knew he had <HI>weighed anchor.</HI> We immediately called a council, when, according to our <HI>reckoning,</HI> the &s;hip had &s;ailed too many <HI>knots</HI> for a pur|&s;uit; and, moreover, our fair weather &s;park had &s;o <HI>managed</HI> his <HI>tack,</HI> as to put it out of our power to <HI>libel the &s;hip;</HI> and, over and above all this, it is deemed con|trary to all rule, to <HI>give chace</HI> in this kind of navi|gation.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="034162_0378_0FFC6AECA0ED36E8">
Well, here then we are&mdash;and faith and troth, all in the dumps&mdash;Deborah is con&s;tantly <HI>&s;nivelling</HI>&mdash;I can &s;carcely keep above water; and poor Molly, like a di&s;|abled weather-beaten yacht, is laid up. For forty years did I follow the &s;ea&mdash;ay, and many a tough gale have I been in; but, <HI>&s;plit my timbers,</HI> if I ever knew what trouble was until now. Po&s;&s;ibly, Mr. Gleaner, as you have already &s;hown your&s;elf wonderfully &s;kil|ful at <HI>refitting,</HI> you may be able to <HI>&s;plice us</HI> together once more, and then, with both <HI>wind</HI> and <HI>tide</HI> in our favour, mayhap we may yet bear a good &s;ail, and after all the&s;e &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, arrive &s;afe at the de&s;ired port. But, Mr. Gleaner, by my &s;oul, you mu&s;t <HI>bear a hand,</HI> for our poor <HI>wave-broken invalid is almo&s;t a wreck,</HI> and &s;he will be &s;peedily <HI>pa&s;t repairing.</HI> I am, Sir, un|til death, your &s;orrowful friend,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From the Saloon of Solitude, <DATE>December 15th, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>WORTHY SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is ju&s;t two years and four months, this day, &s;ince I had the pre&s;umption to addre&s;s you before. I have &s;een with plea&s;ure the gradual progre&s;s of your Margaretta; &s;he &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s every &s;exual virtue, while her attainments render her in every view &s;upe|rior. A &s;uper&s;tructure &s;o rare, however excellent the materials, could not have been accompli&s;hed without the &s;uperintendence of uncommon abilities. The lot of the lovely orphan has been highly di&s;tingui&s;hed; and may &s;he, as far as humanity will permit, be happily exempted from every future evil.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday my girl completed her twelfth year, and while every moment grows more and more intere&s;ting, my mind is &s;truggling under the pre&s;&s;ure of a thou&s;and anxieties. Sophia Aimwell&mdash;tears &s;tream from my eyes while I make the confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;is not exactly what I could wi&s;h! It is true her gentle bo&s;om harbours no
<PB N="33" REF="034162_0379_0FFC6AE8BAFE0918">
particularly alarming propen&s;ities, and, that nature has endowed her with a good under&s;tanding, is al&s;o evi|dent; but notwith&s;tanding the variety of expedients to which I have had recour&s;e, I have never yet been able to impre&s;s upon her mind, the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>appli|cation.</HI> She &s;eems unalterably oppo&s;ed to <HI>uniformity;</HI> nor doth &s;he ever, by her own choice, pur&s;ue either her book, her needle, or her pen, or even tho&s;e lighter matters to which her attention is required, with the <HI>regularity</HI> which is, I have conceived, ab&s;olutely <HI>e&s;&s;en|tial</HI> to any <HI>con&s;iderable proficiency.</HI> My wi&s;h has been to produce her in &s;ociety an accompli&s;hed female; but, alas! the execution of our plans remain not with us. Sophia is particularly aver&s;e to reading and writing; novels have not yet come under her ob&s;ervation. I have thought it too early to entru&s;t tho&s;e fa&s;cinating volumes to her in&s;pection. It appears, Sir, that you do not altogether approve of novels, although, &s;ub|mitting to the impo&s;ition of nece&s;&s;ity, you have put them into the hand of your daughter. Pray, Sir, did you not exerci&s;e di&s;crimination in this re&s;pect, or was Mi&s;s Melworth indulged with the free u&s;e of tho&s;e books? Is it not po&s;&s;ible to <HI>create, by habit,</HI> a ta&s;te for reading, where, unhappily, it is not inherent?</P>
<P>If it is con&s;i&s;tent with your plans, you would do me a particular favour, if you would furni&s;h me with cop|ies of a few of tho&s;e letters, ju&s;t by way of &s;pecimen, which pa&s;&s;ed between Mrs. Vigillius, and her amiable charge, by the po&s;t that was e&s;tabli&s;hed between their re&s;pective chambers; and, any hint of direction which you may conde&s;cend to favour me with, will be re|ceived with much gratitude.</P>
<P>Sophia has never appeared &s;o deeply intere&s;ted in any thing, as in the &s;tory of your Margaretta; and a word from the Gleaner, will go farther than volumes written by any other pen. I am, worthy Sir, with high e&s;teem, your con&s;tant reader, and &s;incere ad|mirer,</P>

<Q><L>Joyle&s;s the man, who hails no bo&s;om friend,</L>

<L>In his lorn &s;elf, who&s;e pains and plea&s;ures end,</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE picture which Mr. Plodder has given of his &s;ituation, is truly pitiable; and I am &s;o far from regarding it as a <HI>caricature,</HI> that I am induced to be|lieve its mo&s;t prominent features will generally &s;tand confe&s;&s;ed, in the life of tho&s;e, who live and die bach|elors. I, however, once knew a happy exception to this conclu&s;ion, who, I confidently conclude, has now taken his &s;tation in a higher &s;tate of being. His de|parture out of time was marked by the <HI>orphan</HI> and the <HI>widow,</HI> with the deepe&s;t regret&mdash;&s;ighs and tears were a tribute which his virtues nece&s;&s;arily drew forth, and his memory is embalmed by the riche&s;t per|fumes which gratitude can be&s;tow. But the dwelling of this &s;ingular character was not a <HI>dreary &s;olitude;</HI> it was <HI>irradiated</HI> by the <HI>&s;miles of infancy;</HI> and while the &s;ons and daughters of penury, of every de&s;cription, &s;hared his bounty, the numerous offspring of a wid|owed &s;i&s;ter, with their truly amiable mother, who was endeared to him, as well by kindred virtues, as by con&s;anguinity, graced his board, became unto him as the children of his youth, and not only threw into ac|tion tho&s;e paternal feelings which were inherent in his bo&s;om, but furni&s;hed al&s;o an ample field for the exer|ci&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="034162_0381_0FFC6AE4A6F144D0">
of tho&s;e uncommon abilities, which were largely drawn out in the cour&s;e of their education. All who knew John Parker, e&s;quire&mdash;generally di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Sheriff Parker&mdash;of Port&s;mouth, in the State of New-Hamp&s;hire, will readily acknowledge, that the voice of panegyric can hardly &s;well too high a note, when &s;ounding the prai&s;es of this great and good man, who lived and died a bachelor.</P>
<P>But it is true, neverthele&s;s, that the life of a bachel|or is almo&s;t invariably gloomy, or thinly &s;trewed with rational plea&s;ure. My friend O&s;wald may &s;erve as an epitome of this cla&s;s of men; he was bred a lawyer, and his youth pa&s;&s;ed in literary application; he either regarded <HI>la belle pa&s;&s;ion</HI> as below that dignity of character at which he aimed, or his moments of lei&s;ure were not &s;ufficient to tho&s;e attentions which its refinements require. Years rolled on, and &s;ucceeding &s;ea&s;ons &s;till found him bu&s;ily engaged in &s;cientific pur|&s;uits, until he attained the &s;ober age of &s;ixty, without having made a <HI>&s;ingle attachment</HI> which could <HI>intere&s;t the heart,</HI> or forcibly engage the tender affections. The cla&s;&s;ics were enchanting; they &s;till continued the fa&s;ci|nating companions of his &s;tudious hours; and, although highly &s;ocial by nature, his <HI>ruling</HI> propen&s;ities &s;eem to have been, for a cour&s;e of years, &s;trangely <HI>over-ruled</HI>&mdash;but when once they were &s;et afloat by reflection, he was rou&s;ed to a melancholy view of his &s;ituation, and could not forbear regarding him&s;elf, in a very e&s;&s;ential &s;en&s;e, <HI>alone in the univer&s;e.</HI> The guides of his youth, tho&s;e per&s;ons whom he had been accu&s;tomed to revere, were mo&s;tly removed out of time, and the companions of his juvenile years were, to a man, "<HI>doubled in wed|lock and multiplied in children.</HI>" O&s;wald was &s;olicited to pa&s;s a month at the villa of Myrtilus, who had been his cla&s;s-mate; he obeyed the &s;ummons, and he found the man&s;ion of his friend the &s;eat of dome&s;tic happine&s;s.</P>
<P>During a period of twenty-five years, the life of Myrtilus had been ameliorated by the &s;ympathies, cor|rected &s;entiments, endearing tenderne&s;s, and faithful attachment, of a lovely and elegant woman; a nume|rous
<PB N="36" REF="034162_0382_0FFC6AE263BDE700">
and beautifully promi&s;ing family of &s;ons and daughters &s;eemed to emulate each other in their filial attentions; eagerly they watched every turn in his countenance, and while their animated features were impre&s;&s;ed by glowing and duteous affection, they de|lighted to anticipate his wi&s;hes, and were on the wing to fulfil his commands. Thom&s;on's family piece was &s;trikingly exemplified; the union of Myrtilus and his charming wife was cemented by &s;acred love; the holy prie&s;t had witne&s;&s;ed their plighted faith; and, enriched by his pious benediction, their mutual tenderne&s;s con|fe&s;&s;ed the righteous &s;anction. "<HI>The world, its pomp, its plea&s;ures and its non&s;en&s;e,</HI>" were to them compara|tively of &s;mall e&s;timation; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing in each other what|ever they accounted tran&s;cendantly excellent, <Q><HI>&s;ome|thing than beauty dearer, both in the mind, and mind illu|mined face&mdash;truth, goodne&s;s, honour, harmony and love.</HI></Q> In natural &s;ucce&s;&s;ion their &s;miling <Q><HI>offspring ro&s;e around</HI></Q> tran&s;cripts of either parent&mdash;<Q><HI>by degrees tho&s;e human blo&s;&s;oms blew, while each &s;ucceeding day, &s;oft as it rolled, evinced &s;ome new charm, the father's lu&s;tre, and the mother's bloom</HI></Q>&mdash;the &s;kilful hand of kind a&s;&s;idu|ous care, had formed their opening minds; <Q><HI>to rear the tender thought, to teach the young idea how to &s;hoot. To pour the fre&s;h in&s;truction o'er the mind&mdash;to breathe the enlivening &s;pirit, and to fix the generous purpo&s;e in the glowing brea&s;t.</HI></Q> This had been, of the&s;e ble&s;t pa|rents, the "<HI>delightful ta&s;k.</HI>" Perhaps they would have found it difficult to embody, by language, the &s;en&s;a|tions of their enraptured bo&s;oms, when, glancing round upon their little family, <Q><HI>Nothing &s;truck their eye but &s;ights of bli&s;s&mdash;All various nature pre&s;&s;ing on the heart: An elegant &s;ufficiency, content, retirement, rural quiet, friend&s;hip, books. Ea&s;e and alternate labour, u&s;eful life, progre&s;&s;ive virtue, and approving Heaven;</HI></Q> and perhaps, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, the tear of luxury which &s;trayed adown their checks, was the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive te&s;timony they could give of their ineffably exqui&s;ite feelings.</P>
<P>On the contemplative mind of O&s;wald nothing was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t&mdash;the pa&s;t, the pre&s;ent, and the future, crowding
<PB N="37" REF="034162_0383_0FFC6AE0800EFFD8">
to his view, combined to furni&s;h a mo&s;t <HI>humiliating compari&s;on;</HI> and &s;pontaneou&s;ly he exclaimed&mdash;<Q><HI>The&s;e are the matchle&s;s joys of virtuous love; and thus their moments fly. The &s;ea&s;ons thus, as cea&s;ele&s;s round a jar|ring world they roll, &s;till find them happy; and con&s;ent|ing Spring &s;heds her own ro&s;y garland o'er their heads: Till evening comes at la&s;t, &s;erene and mild; when, after the long vernal day of life, enamoured more, as more remembrance &s;wells with many a proof of recollected love&mdash;together down they &s;ink in &s;ocial &s;leep; together freed, their gentle &s;pirits fly to &s;cenes where love and bli&s;s im|mortal reign.</HI></Q> What an enchanting view! how beautiful, and how highly fini&s;hed! Did poet ever pen &s;uperior lines?</P>
<P>Our bachelor heaved a &s;igh&mdash;a contra&s;t &s;o glaring was forcibly felt. "No young props," &s;aid he, <Q>lift their green heads for my &s;upport; not an indi|vidual of the ri&s;ing generation is bound to me by the &s;ilken bands of attachment, and this is a con&s;equence of the arrangements of nature and of ju&s;tice; for no mode of rea&s;oning will inve&s;t me with a title to the fervours of that mind, which I have not particularly contributed to form, and in who&s;e flexile dawn I have not been &s;olicitous to obtain an intere&s;t. No de&s;erving female honours me with her di&s;tingui&s;hing regards&mdash;no gentle bo&s;om &s;wells for me the &s;igh of affection. I have not &s;ought to lay the foundation of happine&s;s; and it is in vain that I look for the &s;uper&s;tructure of enjoyment. I have lived in vain, alas! for me <HI>it is now too late to form advantageous connexions, or to enter into engagements which &s;hould be the growth of many ripening &s;uns.</HI> When I expire, my name will be extinct, and all remembrance of me will cea&s;e from the earth!!</Q></P>
<P>Our comfortle&s;s old gentleman was perfectly right in his conclu&s;ions; and we would advi&s;e friend Plod|der to take the hint&mdash;&s;hould any mercenary female, caught by the lure of that e&s;tabli&s;hment in his gift, ca&s;t her lot with him, we are apprehen&s;ive his chance for happine&s;s will be &s;mall. It is too late in life for
<PB N="38" REF="034162_0384_0FFC6ADED08AE8B8">
him to begin that career, which &s;hould at lea&s;t com|mence in the meridian of our days; and, be&s;ides, we think his motive for wi&s;hing to become a married man, is rather invidious. Revenge is rarely ever the parent of that tenderne&s;s, which is &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite in a matrimonial connexion. We think he may have judged erroneou&s;ly of his kindred; it will be &s;trange if in a family &s;o numerous he cannot find a worthy object; we advi&s;e him to make the experi|ment, to cultivate tho&s;e attachments which nature authorizes, and to re&s;ign, at this <HI>late period</HI> (for we have good and cogent rea&s;ons to believe him turned of <HI>&s;ixty</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>fifty</HI>) all preten&s;ions to wedlock.</P>
<P>But however Mr. Plodder may determine, it cannot affect Serafina. The name of Clifford is now ab&s;orb|ed in that of Seymour; and the accompli&s;hed maiden, who wore it with tran&s;cendent honour, has added one more to the li&s;t of tho&s;e matrons, who give dignity to, and be&s;tow the brighte&s;t ornament upon humanity. I will own that &s;ome months have elap&s;ed &s;ince the receipt of Mr. Plodder's letter; and, farther, that the marriage of Mi&s;s Clifford was not then &s;olemnized; but as I was apprized of her engagements to a <HI>worthy</HI> man, and as neither his epi&s;tle, nor that of the facetious Mr. Bellamour, contained any thing which was con&s;idered of &s;ufficient importance to <HI>&s;top proceedings,</HI> I did not think it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to derange my plans, by an earlier attention to their letters. Uninfluenced and undi&s;mayed by the threats of Mr. Bellamour, I might have contented my&s;elf with &s;imply announcing the marriage of Mi&s;s Clifford; but feeling a degree of compa&s;&s;ion for Mr. Plodder, and &s;incerely wi&s;hing ev|ery man and woman judiciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed of in holy wedlock, before they have fully completed their thir|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eth year, I have produced a more copious exordium, than is perhaps nece&s;&s;ary; and, as I know a <HI>wedding</HI> is a very grateful &s;ubject to mo&s;t of <HI>my fair readers,</HI> I will, after briefly narrating a few preliminary articles, invite them to that of Mi&s;s Clifford.</P>

The reader will have the goodne&s;s to recollect the important advantages which Edward Hamilton re|ceived, during his &s;outhern tour, from a friend, re&s;i|dent in the State of South-Carolina; he will remem|ber al&s;o, the &s;ub&s;equent embarra&s;&s;ments of that friend, and that circum&s;tances induced a belief that the &s;tate of bankruptcy, into which the generous Seymour was precipitated, if not <HI>procured,</HI> was at <HI>lea&s;t accelerated</HI> by his efforts in favour of Edward Hamilton. Ingrati|tude can never take root in a noble mind; it could therefore find no place, either in the bo&s;om of Mr. Hamilton, or that of the father of his Margaretta.</P>
<P>The abilities of Mr. Melworth were, on this occa&s;ion, commen&s;urate with his wi&s;hes; and, after devoting a few days to paternal claims, and making ample pro|vi&s;ion for the complete adju&s;tment of Hamilton's af|fairs, he ha&s;ted upon the broadly philanthropic wings of benevolence, to South-Carolina. His dignified mein, con&s;picuous merit, and letters of addre&s;s, pro|cured him a free acce&s;s to the creditors of Mr. Sey|mour; and, with that di&s;patch which evinced the thor|ough accomptant, their &s;everal claims were examined, and a fund appropriated fully adequate to the reim|bur&s;ement of every ju&s;t debt, while the unfortunate debtor, uncon&s;cious of the &s;teps taking in his favour, wore away his melancholy hours immured within the walls of a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The misfortunes of Seymour were not the re&s;ult of mi&s;conduct; if there was a fault in his arrangements, the <HI>principle</HI> which produced it, conferred thereon a lu&s;tre which gave it, both in <HI>appearance</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> the rich colouring of the mo&s;t &s;plendid virtue. It is im|po&s;&s;ible but he who &s;uffers by his exten&s;ive benevolence, and his commi&s;eration for the unhappy, mu&s;t carry with him his <HI>credentials of &s;uperior worth</HI>&mdash;mu&s;t exhibit unequivocal te&s;timonies of the ju&s;tice of his title to <HI>admiration.</HI> It is true that the injunction to be <HI>ju&s;t</HI> before we are <HI>generous,</HI> is worthy of ob&s;ervation; but if I endow a fellow creature with the means of obtain|ing a competency to-day, and to-morrow the &s;hip in

which was contained my remaining property, is, by a &s;troke of Providence, whelmed beneath the waves, I do not &s;ee that I am <HI>greatly cen&s;urable</HI> becau&s;e I did not, in the dread of this evil, withhold the &s;olace which it was <HI>ye&s;terday in my power to give.</HI> Mr. Seymour was of that cla&s;s of men who never &s;hut their ears again&s;t a tale of woe, and by con&s;equence he could not lay up to him&s;elf much trea&s;ure; and when his &s;hips of mer|chandize were either wrecked or captured, he had no means of &s;atisfying tho&s;e rapacious creditors, who, op|erated upon by principles the rever&s;e of tho&s;e which actuated his bo&s;om, pur&s;ued him with unrelenting &s;e|verity.</P>
<P>It was not until Mr. Melworth had procured a reg|ular cour&s;e of proceedings; until every thing was in train; legal documents obtained, and the formalities nece&s;&s;ary to his liberation completely adju&s;ted, that he waited upon Mr. Seymour in his confinement; and he introduced him&s;elf to the then, (in his own e&s;timation) unfortunate man, by words to this effect:&mdash;</P>
<P>"My name, Sir, is Charles Melworth. I am no &s;tranger to the feelings of the unhappy. I am perfect|ly acquainted with the hi&s;tory of your rectitude, of your misfortunes, and of your generous munificence. But, Sir, you mu&s;t not expect to contribute &s;o nobly to the nece&s;&s;ities of an Edward Hamilton, and to exerci&s;e toward that young man &s;uch unexampled forbearance with impunity: <HI>The day of retribution is at length ar|rived; the &s;on of Charles Melworth, the hu&s;band of his Margaretta, mu&s;t not &s;ubmit to unreturnable obligations. Here, Sir, is your di&s;charge in full; you are, from this moment, exonerated from a pre&s;&s;ure, which mu&s;t have been truly irk&s;ome to a mind like your's; and you receive this exoneration as a debt, which is your incontrovertible due.</HI> At liberty to pur&s;ue your own wi&s;hes, you will, doubt|le&s;s, be expeditious in departing from a place &s;o little &s;uited to your feelings and your character. <HI>But, ere you go, as we are now upon even ground, I reque&s;t a lea&s;e of your good opinion, to be continued or forfeited, as I &s;hall, in future, merit.</HI>"</P>

Melworth might have proceeded uninterruptedly to a much greater length; the under&s;tanding of Sey|mour underwent a kind of temporary petrifaction; a&s;toni&s;hment ab&s;orbed his every faculty. Melworth pau&s;ed in vain, and it was not until he had taken a variety of methods to rou&s;e him to attention, that he was capable of li&s;tening to a regular eclairci&s;&s;ement. But to &s;ketch his feelings, when the liberating truth fir&s;t opened upon him, were a fruitle&s;s attempt; as well might I delineate to mortal view a di&s;embodied &s;pirit, as give the form of language to tho&s;e exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations which then pervaded the bo&s;om of Sey|mour; he however &s;truggled not again&s;t the extricat|ing hand of his nobly generous friend&mdash;his compo&s;i|tion contained not a particle of <HI>fal&s;e delicacy</HI>&mdash;he was con&s;cious that a change of circum&s;tances would have produced in him a &s;imilarity of exertions; and his unexpected enlargement, while it confounded his ene|mies, re&s;tored to his numerous friends that peace which his misfortunes had cha&s;ed from their bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>His emancipation, giving him an opportunity of an accurate inve&s;tigation, he di&s;covered many frauds by which he had been gro&s;sly injured; the&s;e he expo&s;|ed, and debts to a con&s;iderable amount were recover|ed, while the <HI>return</HI> of &s;everal cargoes, that had been <HI>detained by the Briti&s;h for adjudication,</HI> by putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of con&s;iderable property, once more un|furled for him the golden wings of &s;ucce&s;sful com|merce! Again he floated buoyant upon the &s;tream of pro&s;perity; and the expanding buds of hope obtained in his bo&s;om primeval vigour. Hardly had he com|pleted his twenty-eighth year, ere he had witne&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes which I have thus ha&s;tily &s;ketched; and he may in truth be con&s;idered as an early profi|cient in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity. That he embraced the fir&s;t po&s;&s;ible opportunity of vi&s;iting Hamilton-Place will not be doubted; and it will readily be conceived that his arrival there was expected by his friends with uncommon impatience. Seymour was not only an accompli&s;hed man, but he had performed the part of a

guardian angel to Edward; and both Margaretta and Serafina regarded the moment which was to introduce them to a character who&s;e virtues were unequivocal, and to whom they were e&s;&s;entially indebted among the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of their lives. Margaretta ad|vanced to meet the <HI>protector of her hu&s;band,</HI> with that cha&s;te and elegant freedom which the dignified mat|ron knows to a&s;&s;ume, nor did &s;he conceive &s;he tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed any rule of propriety when her &s;nowy hand was extended to his manly pre&s;&s;ure, and her lovely cheek was mode&s;tly bent to his &s;alute. Serafina ac|quitted her&s;elf with more timidity&mdash;her manner was characteri&s;tic of virgin delicacy; and while Seymour pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his lips, "<HI>a higher bloom</HI>" &s;uffu&s;ed her animated features; and &s;he permitted tho&s;e civilities to which as the &s;i&s;ter of Hamilton &s;he was entitled, with &s;ilent complacency: Admiration and tender grat|itude were, however, evinced in her every ge&s;ture; and her expre&s;&s;ive eye beamed tho&s;e unequivocal tokens of welcome which her tongue refu&s;ed to utter.</P>
<P>Edward ardently wi&s;hed to reward the de&s;erving Seymour, by &s;ome &s;ignal token of his grateful affec|tion. He regarded the hand of his &s;i&s;ter as an ine&s;ti|mable prize&mdash;too rich, in his e&s;timation, to be con|&s;igned to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any but his friend; and Seymour, on his part, from the moment he beheld Mi&s;s Clifford, became the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned of men. But Serafina, devoted to the family of her brother, had repeatedly declared her <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> and <HI>unalterable</HI> predilection for a &s;ingle life. Seymour was privately advertized of this re&s;olution, and <HI>its motive,</HI> by Ed|ward and Margaretta; and thus obtaining a <HI>&s;ecret clue to her affections,</HI> he made his approaches with that addre&s;s, which, in this age of <HI>fine&s;&s;e,</HI> &s;eems to be a nec|e&s;&s;ary part of the character of a fini&s;hed gentleman. Had he directly attacked the fortre&s;s, by the common methods of a&s;&s;ailment, the po&s;&s;ibility is, that, prepared for an event, an expectation of which might have been induced by a variety of circum&s;tances, &s;he would re&s;olutely have maintained her ground; but, proceed|ing

covertly to undermine, he &s;lowly made his advan|ces, until, gradually &s;apping the foundation of her re|&s;i&s;tance, a coalition became an event in cour&s;e. <HI>Ham|ilton and his charming wife; the little gentleman, whom Serafina regarded as a prodigy, with the infant Margaret|ta; the&s;e were the themes of panegyric, on which the enam|oured de&s;igner copiou&s;ly dwelt, during tho&s;e interviews that were frequently extended far beyond the limits which would have an&s;wered the wi&s;hes of common amity.</HI> The hours pa&s;&s;ed unheeded by; they were &s;entimental and refin|ed; the heart of Serafina was deeply impre&s;&s;ed; &s;he was con&s;cious of her &s;ituation, and &s;he &s;ecretly ex|claimed&mdash;"<HI>Yes, the&s;e delicious moments, &s;natched with the man who hath thus imperceptibly intere&s;ted my be&s;t affec|tions, are productive of more highly ze&s;ted plea&s;ures, than I have ever yet experienced.</HI>"</P>
<P>Edward and Margaretta &s;aw that their utmo&s;t wi&s;h|es for their lovely &s;i&s;ter was on the point of gratifica|tion, and they felicitated them&s;elves on the pro&s;pect of an e&s;tabli&s;hment for Mi&s;s Clifford, that was every way commen&s;urate with her beauty and rare qualifications. They were careful not to interrupt the progre&s;s of a union they had &s;o much at heart. <HI>Apparently uncon|&s;cious</HI> of the growing importance of a friend, to whom they were &s;o warmly attached, not a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation e&s;caped them; and thus was Serafina <HI>entrapped</HI> and <HI>captivated,</HI> before &s;he had received the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the combination formed again&s;t the &s;ingular re&s;olu|tion &s;he had avowed.</P>
<P>Seymour is one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed men I ever beheld; his per&s;on is uncommonly hand&s;ome, and wonderfully prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing; his manners are ea&s;y and dignified; his morals are unexceptionable; and, me|liorated in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, he unites, in him|&s;elf, every requi&s;ite which can in&s;ure felicity to a con|fiding female. To Serafina he every moment became of &s;till more con&s;equence, until, imaged upon her every thought, <HI>that hour was marked by frigid in&s;ipidity, that pre&s;ented not the man of her heart</HI>&mdash;that witne&s;&s;ed not his indefatigable and tender a&s;&s;iduities.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="034162_0390_0FFC6ACCCE2E3BD8">
It was after his return from one of tho&s;e little nece&s;|&s;ary ab&s;ences, which Serafina &s;ecretly lamented as real misfortunes, that, finding her alone, with his accu&s;|tomed freedom, he took a &s;eat by her &s;ide; and, after relating a new in&s;tance of the benevolence of her broth|er, he fixed his fine eyes tenderly upon her; the ready tear, at the recital of Edward's virtues, had &s;trayed unbidden from its chry&s;tal &s;ource, and was making its pearly way adown her lovely cheek, when, unable longer to re&s;i&s;t his feelings, he took her not reluctant hand, and impre&s;&s;ing upon i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>&s;econd ki&s;s of love,</HI> he ardently exclaimed&mdash;"Ah!

Surely, the &s;i&s;ter of Edward Hamilton may &s;till pre&s;erve that enviable character, and yet conde&s;cend to wear the title of the tender friend of Seymour.

<P>Serafina, overcome by a declaration which &s;he had long fervently wi&s;hed, had averted her face for the purpo&s;e of regulating tho&s;e tender emotions, that, ri&s;|ing in rebellion again&s;t their lovely mi&s;tre&s;s, crim&s;oned her face, and filled her eyes with the mo&s;t delicious tears &s;he had ever &s;hed. Soon, however, re&s;uming her native fortitude, &s;he wiped from her checks tho&s;e of|ficious drops; and, &s;miling with more beauty than poets ever yet attributed to the dewy morn, with mild dig|nity (having previou&s;ly entreated the &s;upplicating Sey|mour to quit his humble po&s;ture) &s;he thus re&s;ponded: "You are, Sir, entitled to my utmo&s;t frankne&s;s&mdash;the confidence which you repo&s;e in me, inve&s;ts you with this claim. I had formed a re&s;olution to continue &s;ingle: Penetrated by the virtues of my brother, and my not le&s;s amiable &s;i&s;ter, I knew not that the univer&s;e

produced &s;imilar excellence&mdash;But you, Sir, appear to me to po&s;&s;e&s;s a mind fraught with tho&s;e perfections I have delighted to trace. To adhere to my plan, <HI>after conviction of the error which originated it,</HI> would draw upon me the accu&s;ation of ob&s;tinacy.

<P>Serafina cea&s;ed to &s;peak&mdash;&s;he trembled exce&s;&s;ively; and, by a kind of involuntary motion, threw her hand|kerchief over her glowing face&mdash;Seymour caught her hand in exta&s;y&mdash;But it was not our de&s;ign to fini&s;h this &s;cene; and not a &s;tep further will we proceed therein.</P>
<P>The now affianced lovers received the congratula|tions of their friends, with their accu&s;tomed dignity of character; no unnece&s;&s;ary delays were permitted; a few revolving weeks produced the bridal morn; Sey|mour plighted his faith with Serafina at the altar. Mr. Melworth, with that delicacy and propriety, for which he is remarkable, officiated as the nuptial father of Mi&s;s Clifford, and the venerable Urbanus <HI>received, while bending angels regi&s;tered, their vows.</HI> Serafina was a beautiful tran&s;cript of Margaretta; her dre&s;s was white mu&s;lin, wrought after the &s;ame elegant pattern of the robe, which had been worn upon a &s;im|ilar occa&s;ion by her friend. But our party was not &s;o &s;elect as that which had graced Margaretta's wedding-day. Some choice &s;pirits attended the relations of Mr. Seymour, from South-Carolina; and they were re&s;olved, as they &s;aid, to make a day of it. Their boi&s;terous mirth, however, did not e&s;&s;entially impede the plea&s;ure of the &s;entimentali&s;t. Margaretta, aided

by Mary, pre&s;ided; and it is unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that hilarity was cha&s;ti&s;ed by delicacy. The evening was concluded by an elegant rural ball, and every arrange|ment announced the ample fortune and capacious heart of the munificent Hamilton.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour has erected a neat edifice in the neigh|bourhood of Hamilton-Place; he has di&s;played much ta&s;te in his buildings and his gardens; but his elegant fancy has been no where &s;o con&s;picuous as in a beau|tiful grove, on which he has be&s;towed every embel|li&s;hment of art and nature; and his &s;eat, principally di&s;criminated by this enchanting &s;pot, is be&s;t known by the name of Seymour-Grove.</P>
<P>Mr. Melworth too, has tried his talents at architec|ture, and he has di&s;tingui&s;hed the paradi&s;iacal retire|ment which he has completed, by the appellation of the Cottage of Amity. Thither, when we would inhale plea&s;ures of the pure&s;t and the highe&s;t kind, our re|&s;pective families collect; and if mortality is ever the abode of felicity, this man&s;ion is, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, its re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Serafina's attachment to the family of her brother, is, if po&s;&s;ible, augmented &s;ince her marriage, and her regards are abundantly reciprocated.</P>
<P>Margaretta has introduced into being her third in|fant, to whom &s;he has given the combined names of Mary-Augu&s;ta. Serafina continues her predilection in favour of the little William; but Mary whi&s;pers me, that a few months will probably produce a new candi|date for the affections of Mrs. Seymour, who will, doubtle&s;s, generalize, or render le&s;s marked, her at|tachment to the children of her brother; and, in the mean time, &s;he has perfect complacence in her matri|monial connexion; &s;he regards her hu&s;band as the fir&s;t of men, and he&s;itates not to confe&s;s her&s;elf the happie&s;t of women.</P>

<P>HONEST Captain Seafort is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the full commi&s;eration of our re&s;pective families. The Melworths, the Hamiltons, the Seymours, with Mary, and my&s;elf, &s;well for him the &s;igh of regret.

<P>If we comprehend Captain Seafort, when he &s;ays&mdash;"<HI>frequently has &s;he flung out fal&s;e colours, and after bring|ing to her lure many a gallant &s;ail, &s;he has up jibb, and borne away quite in another direction</HI>"&mdash;we cannot altogether acquit Mi&s;s Seafort. It is true, a weak, incon&s;i&s;tent, and irregular mode of conduct in the commerce be|tween the &s;exes, from its <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed characteri&s;tic</HI> features, hath been hitherto tolerated, or has not excited that degree of contempt, and &s;everity of reprehen&s;ion, in the <HI>female,</HI> as in the <HI>male</HI> world. But in this enlight|ened period, when the &s;ex &s;eem emerging from the clouds which have hitherto enveloped them, and the <HI>revolution of events is advancing that half of the human &s;pecies, which hath hitherto been involved in the night of darkne&s;s, toward the irradiating &s;un of &s;cience,</HI> we had <HI>ho|ped</HI> that women would have been contented to have re&s;igned their charter for ab&s;urd and cruel trifling, and that a <HI>female coquette</HI> would have been held in as much dete&s;tation as a <HI>male.</HI> We allow, however,
<PB N="48" REF="034162_0394_0FFC6AC25B7C8B78">
that <HI>old habits</HI> are not ea&s;ily relinqui&s;hed; gradually the morning breaks, and we are willing to wait, until mid-day, for the meridian perfection of the &s;ex.</P>
<P>For Mi&s;s Seafort, we hope &s;he will call into exer|ci&s;e the heroi&s;m of the female character. Upon the gla&s;&s;y &s;tream of tranquillity, her own efforts mu&s;t again produce her. It is &s;urely a pity to yield a <HI>coxcomb &s;uch a triumph,</HI> as her continued inaction, and melan|choly <HI>wearing away, upon the flats of apathy,</HI> would be|&s;tow. She will con&s;ider that by the "<HI>fal&s;e colours &s;he has hung out,</HI>" &s;he has in &s;ome mea&s;ure provoked the attack, that &s;he is in one view <HI>the aggre&s;&s;or</HI>&mdash;that if &s;he <HI>hath &s;uffered,</HI> &s;he hath al&s;o <HI>inflicted &s;ufferings;</HI> and that although it is evident &s;he hath not merited the neglect of him for whom &s;he mourns, yet it is rare that re|taliation is con&s;igned to the individual hand of him, who was originally aggrieved: The pa&s;t, we know, cannot be recalled, and we coun&s;el Mi&s;s Seafort to view her accounts with the world as adju&s;ted, the bal|ance &s;truck, and her arrearage fully paid.

<P>The poor Lavinia is a melancholy in&s;tance of the fa|tal con&s;equence of an unlimited indulgence of tho&s;e &s;en|&s;ibilities, which, under the requi&s;ite control, frequently make the felicity, and are always the ornament of humanity. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a heart, glowing with every &s;entiment which is dictated by benevolence; &s;he was eminently capable of friend&s;hip; di&s;daining &s;u&s;picion, her confidence in the <HI>appearances</HI> of virtue was exactly what it &s;hould have been in long tried worth, and her &s;u&s;ceptibility was extreme. Born to an opulent for|tune, &s;he had multiplied opportunities of gratifying the propen&s;ities of a munificent mind, and &s;he was re|garded by the &s;ons and daughters of penury as the angel of con&s;olation. She had lo&s;t her father in her in|fancy, and &s;he continued the only prop of an amiable mother, of whom &s;he was the riche&s;t &s;olace; &s;he was beautiful in her per&s;on, of a plea&s;ing under&s;tanding, and highly accompli&s;hed; her manners were a tran&s;cript of her mind, open and unde&s;igning; and a man of feel|ing would have &s;uffered death, rather than have pur|loined the tranquillity of a bo&s;om &s;o exqui&s;itely at|tuned, or betrayed the confidence repo&s;ed in him by &s;uch tran&s;cendent excellence. I think I have never &s;een a more amiable female than Lavinia; I recollect attending Mary and Margaretta, on a vi&s;it made to her and her worthy mother. Margaretta was then a child&mdash;&s;he had been with us only one month; but young as &s;he was, the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Lavinia captivated her little heart. A large party was a&s;&s;embled, La|vinia
<PB N="51" REF="034162_0397_0FFC6AB9BA9446E0">
extorted general admiration; her <HI>equal attentions</HI> to her numerous gue&s;ts, the elegance of her move|ments, her &s;olicitude to contribute to the plea&s;ures of every individual, her duteous attention to her mother, the eagerne&s;s with which &s;he ha&s;tened to dive&s;t her of every care, while the eyes of her enraptured parent followed her with an expre&s;&s;ion of extacy, which I have &s;eldom &s;een equalled, and never &s;urpa&s;&s;ed; all this was calculated to produce the highe&s;t degree of approbation, and &s;he nece&s;&s;arily received the hom|age of every eye. At our reque&s;t, &s;he played and &s;ung, and her execution gave general &s;atisfaction; dancing con&s;tituted a part of our entertainment, and the movements of Lavinia were attuned by harmony. Every heart congratulated the mother of &s;uch a daughter; and we became a&s;&s;ured that Emly-Hou&s;e was indeed the abode of felicity.</P>
<P>From this &s;ketch it will be imagined that the edu|cation of Lavinia had not been neglected; and indeed, the truth is, that her anxious and tenderly intere&s;ted mother had &s;pared, in the cultivation of her mind, neither pains nor expen&s;e; nor was there any defi|ciency, except in tho&s;e <HI>cautionary guards</HI> with which young people &s;hould invariably be furni&s;hed, particu|larly when their &s;en&s;ibilities are manife&s;tly glowing, and their brilliant imaginations are &s;ketching &s;cenes, which, alas! the pre&s;ent lap&s;ed &s;tate of humanity will never give them to realize. To throw a re&s;traint up|on the confiding innocence, the fine feelings, and gen|erous propen&s;ities of the opening mind&mdash;<HI>to plant the germ of &s;u&s;picion</HI> in that &s;oil which hath hitherto pro|duced only a growth of the mo&s;t &s;weet &s;cented flowers, is an act which &s;eems to wear an invidious a&s;pect, and it is undoubtedly a painful effort; yet, &s;uch is the imbecility of our nature, and &s;uch, in many in&s;tances, its depravity, as to render it the duty of every pre|ceptor, to endeavour as early as prudence will permit, or rea&s;on can dige&s;t the information, to give his pupils an accurate view of "<HI>man as he is.</HI>"</P>

It will not be doubted that the per&s;onal charms, fine accompli&s;hments, and <HI>independent fortune</HI> of La|vinia, produced many candidates for her favour. In fact, &s;he was &s;urrounded by a little army of admirers; but although her heart refu&s;ed to &s;urrender to any of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate declarations, which a&s;&s;ailed her ear, (and &s;he invariably received every one who di&s;tingui&s;h|ed her by his regard, with that ingenuous frankne&s;s, which, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, always marks the conduct of an amiable woman) they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their &s;o|licitations, affirming that her avowed preference of an individual &s;hould alone con&s;titute a period to their pur&s;uit. Among the acquaintance of Lavinia, figured con&s;picuou&s;ly an accompli&s;hed youth, for whom her gentle bo&s;om had long &s;ighed. All her &s;ecret wi&s;hes were breathed for Alphon&s;o, but Alphon&s;o had never taken rank among the number of her declared ad|mirers. This, however, was, by the enamoured La|vinia, imputed to an <HI>exce&s;s of del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y;</HI> and often did &s;he whi&s;per a &s;election from a favourite ballad:&mdash;"<HI>Among the re&s;t young Edwin bow'd, but never talk'd of love.</HI>" Mean time, every day, and almo&s;t every hour, gave new energy to the a&s;&s;iduities of Alphon&s;o; and no opportunity pa&s;&s;ed unmarked by his di&s;tingui&s;hing attentions. In tho&s;e rural walks, in which it was the cu&s;tom of Lavinia to accompany her juvenile compan|ions, Alphon&s;o was &s;till by her &s;ide; for her the ripen|ed berry was culled, the elegantly fancied bouquet was pre&s;ented with a mode&s;t and impre&s;&s;ive air, and, to encircle her auburn tre&s;&s;es, he enwreathed a garland of the choice&s;t flowers.</P>
<P>He was careful to procure for her every new pub|lication, and he would pa&s;s whole days in reading to her tho&s;e volumes which he judged worthy her atten|tion; <HI>every impa&s;&s;ioned &s;entence</HI> he would render &s;till more glowing, never forgetting, by <HI>empha&s;is</HI> and <HI>ge&s;ture,</HI> to point to the <HI>heart</HI> of Lavinia each moving &s;enti|ment. Often did he fix his eyes, <HI>apparently beaming with love, on her glowing face; on the&s;e occa&s;ions he would a&s;&s;ume a tender air, &s;igh deeply, place his &s;pread hands upon

his heart, anon cla&s;p them in a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;tic rap|ture; and rarely ever did he conclude this well acted farce without a tear, which he affected to conceal, and which the too credulous Lavinia never failed to impute to delicacy, &s;trength of affection, and unexampled re&s;pect.</HI> He was inva|riably her conductor to places of public re&s;ort; and he &s;eemed to regard every gentleman who offered him&s;elf by way of e&s;cort, as an invader of his prerogative.</P>
<P>Thus rolled on the halcyon months. Lavinia's at|tachment every hour augmented; all her &s;en&s;ibilities were in full force; her unbounded confidence was en|gaged, and her highe&s;t complacency en&s;ured. Of du|plicity &s;he had formed but a vague idea; &s;he had heard, it is true, of the exi&s;tence of a propen&s;ity which &s;he e&s;teemed <HI>mon&s;trous,</HI> and it ranked in her mind, with the &s;tories of giants and hobgoblins, which &s;he had received from her nur&s;e, in her days of childhood. To have imputed nefarious purpo&s;es to Alphon&s;o, &s;he would have regarded as a mo&s;t cruel outrage again&s;t the brighte&s;t a&s;&s;emblage of virtues, which ever irradiated a human bo&s;om; <HI>and to re&s;train the expan&s;ive flights of an ardent and luxuriant fancy, &s;he had never been taught.</HI> She e&s;teemed&mdash;&s;he loved&mdash;and at the &s;hrine of tender friend&s;hip, &s;he offered the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned vows. The numerous friends of Alphon&s;o and La|vinia, gave them to each other; the world announced their marriage as an event which would &s;peedily take place; her profe&s;&s;ed admirers, conceiving &s;he had made her election, decently withdrew their preten&s;ions, avowing a manly re&s;olution, to act, in future, "<HI>a brother's part.</HI>" Alphon&s;o continued to evince him&s;elf in every action, and in every arrangement, the mo&s;t <HI>impa&s;&s;ioned of lovers;</HI> and yet, &s;trange to tell, his tongue had never uttered a <HI>&s;ingle &s;entence,</HI> which announced what <HI>his eyes were continually proclaiming;</HI> which amounted to the &s;imple declaration&mdash;<HI>I love you.</HI> The mother of Lavinia beheld with approbation the grow|ing attachment of her beloved child&mdash;&s;he regarded Alphon&s;o as a man every way worthy of her daughter; and &s;he anticipated a rich harve&s;t of dome&s;tic felicity,
<PB N="54" REF="034162_0400_0FFC6AB421249E80">
when Lavinia, wedded, &s;hould augment her joys, and probably give to her embraces a blooming offspring, amid who&s;e endearing care&s;&s;es &s;he &s;hould breathe her la&s;t maternal &s;igh.</P>
<P>At length, however, the wary matron could not for|bear to que&s;tion&mdash;"It is &s;trange, my dear Lavinia, that Alphon&s;o is not <HI>more explicit</HI>&mdash;you have received his attention with all that indulgent complacency, which is proper to a mode&s;t and a decent girl; he cannot doubt your approbation; what then can &s;u&s;pend his mo&s;t unequivocal declarations?

Lavinia <HI>blu&s;hed expre&s;&s;ive|ly;</HI> but it was not, however, a <HI>blu&s;h of conviction.</HI> The doubt, implied in the ob&s;ervations of her mother, &s;he conceived derogatory to the <HI>immaculate honour of the man, whom &s;he deemed incapable of error;</HI> and &s;he had never before felt &s;o much inclined to arraign the can|dour, and even the ju&s;tice, of her, who, from the fir&s;t dawn of rea&s;on, &s;he had regarded as a perfect model of every excellence. <Q>Alphon&s;o, &s;he replied, is the mo&s;t <HI>delicate of men</HI>&mdash;of his ardent love I have had <HI>incon|te&s;tible proofs</HI>&mdash;a thou&s;and times has the mo&s;t une|quivocal declarations trembled upon his lips; but that <HI>uncommon re&s;pect</HI> which inmingles with his re|gards, his tender <HI>awe of me,</HI> hath hitherto re&s;trained the fervour of an avowal, which is <HI>but delayed.</HI> Ought I to regard as reprehen&s;ible a mode of conduct, manife&s;tly the re&s;ult of his <HI>con&s;ideration for my feelings?</HI> Alphon&s;o, Madam, is not to be influenced by <HI>common principles;</HI> he is affectionate, amiable, and di&s;inter|e&s;ted; his pa&s;&s;ion is <HI>&s;entimental,</HI> preci&s;ely of that de|&s;cription which I wi&s;h; and &s;o eligible is my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, indulged, as I am, with the pre&s;ence and tender approbation of my dear mamma, and amply gratified by the full enjoyment of tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which I derive from contributing to the relief of the nece&s;&s;itous, that, provided the a&s;&s;iduities and tender friend&s;hip of Alphon&s;o is allowed me, I cannot form a higher idea of earthly felicity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="034162_0401_0FFC6AB02DA8C050z`">
Thus was the matron &s;ilenced; and &s;he the more readily acquie&s;ced in the &s;entiments of her daughter, as her upright mind could not conceive of turpitude &s;o <HI>enormous,</HI> as that which mu&s;t excite a being, <HI>deliber|ately to perpetrate the murder of the peace of a fellow creature, without a &s;ingle apparent motive to &s;timulate to a deed of &s;uch atrocity.</HI> She al&s;o knew how to e&s;timate the value of her daughter; &s;he was con&s;cious of her exqui&s;ite beauty, and rare accompli&s;hments, and &s;he was &s;en&s;ible that her fortune was amply &s;ufficient to gratify the mo&s;t ambitious views; an impartial deci&s;ion would, &s;he confidently imagined, pronounce her in every re&s;pect the equal of Alphon&s;o, and &s;he therefore gave to the winds her maternal anxieties.</P>
<P>In this train matters continued many weeks longer: Alphon&s;o contrived to extend his treacherous entangle|ments to the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible duration. Perceiving, however, that he had at length attenuated the thread to the very point of breaking, he thought proper &s;ud|denly to decamp; and having made up his mind, he announced to the family, quite in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> manner, his intention of taking a journey, mentioning it as a thing of cour&s;e, and, quaintly enough, expre&s;&s;ing his wi&s;hes that he might &s;oon meet again, friends, whom he &s;hould <HI>ever value.</HI></P>
<P>The mother of Lavinia now &s;aw clearly the fate of her beloved child; but &s;he he&s;itated to make a di&s;cov|ery, an apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equence of which, fill|ed her with immea&s;ureable dread! while Lavinia &s;till continued ingeniou&s;ly rea&s;oning away appearances. Alphon&s;o was &s;till the be&s;t, and mo&s;t unde&s;igning of men&mdash;&s;he confidently expected his &s;peedy return; nor did &s;he experience any other regret, than what his ab|&s;ence occa&s;ioned, until many &s;ucceeding po&s;ts pa&s;&s;ed without bringing her a &s;ingle line; then, indeed, her utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s and candour was put to the te&s;t, to invent apologies, or to account for a conduct &s;o am|biguous. Still, however, <HI>the particular days in which the po&s;t returned, might have &s;lipped his memory; his letters might have been written; his &s;ervant might have delayed
<PB N="56" REF="034162_0402_0FFC6AADDCEB7140">
to put them in the office; the courier might have been un|faithful.</HI> In &s;hort, &s;truggling to detain the deluder hope, there was &s;carce an ab&s;urdity which &s;he would not have admitted, rather than &s;uppo&s;e that bo&s;om, where &s;he had trea&s;ured up her deare&s;t expectations of earthly bli&s;s, &s;hould have relinqui&s;hed every good. Conviction, however, could not be delayed; it per|force obtained; and when &s;he learned that the beau|tiful Monimia had become the object of his pur&s;uit, &s;he could no longer doubt.</P>
<P>She received the information with a &s;teadine&s;s and compo&s;ure, which was more terrifying to her mother, than the mo&s;t violent exclamation of grief. She &s;hed no tears, nor uttered a &s;ingle complaint; but, folding her &s;nowy arms, with a look expre&s;&s;ive of the deepe&s;t woe, and all the aggravated angui&s;h of a broken &s;pirit, &s;he meekly bent her head in token of re&s;ignation; and while evidently a&s;&s;aying to arm her&s;elf with fortitude, overpow|ered by the magnitude of the &s;truggle, &s;he fainted in the arms of her agonized parent! On her return to life, &s;he gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tokens of a deranged intellect; and the di&s;order of her mind hath hitherto baffled the power of art. For a time, her lucid intervals cheri&s;hed the hope of a perfect re&s;toration; but her &s;en&s;ibility was extreme; and, <HI>unaccu&s;tomed to yield the control of the pa&s;&s;ions to the regency of rea&s;on, is it wonderful that, upon an occa&s;ion &s;o cruelly calamitous, &s;he became unequal to the combat?</HI></P>
<P>Let the Monimia's of the female world beware, however meritorious they may be&mdash;they do not, they cannot &s;urpa&s;s the amiable, the highly accompli&s;hed Lavinia; and an Alphon&s;o who could meditate the de&s;truction of a happine&s;s &s;o well founded, as was that of the now de&s;olate &s;ufferer, is abandoned enough to harbour the mo&s;t atrocious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The glimmerings of rea&s;on which Lavinia di&s;cov|ered, during the fir&s;t weeks that &s;ucceeded her misfor|tune, were tran&s;ient, and more and more unfrequent; and the faint traces of recollection which &s;he evinced, produced the mo&s;t heart affecting melancholy that

can be imagined. She is now a confirmed maniac; and &s;o total is her derangement, that &s;ome months have elap&s;ed &s;ince &s;he has manife&s;ted the &s;malle&s;t atten|tion even to her mother. She frequently holds long ideal dialogues with Alphon&s;o, re&s;ponding for him, and it is ob&s;ervable that &s;he utters the an&s;wers which &s;he &s;hapes for him <HI>preci&s;ely in his tone of voice.</HI> Accord|ing to the caprice of the time being, &s;he alternately upbraids and &s;oothes him; and &s;he is, by turns, grave and gay. Now with floods of tears &s;he weeps his exit, chanting at his &s;uppo&s;ed ob&s;equies, the funeral dirge; and anon, in an extacy of joy, &s;he felicitates her&s;elf on his re&s;toration to virtue and to her; not a &s;entiment does &s;he utter in her &s;tronge&s;t paroxy&s;ms, but is cha&s;ti&s;ed by delicacy, but is de&s;criptive of the purity and benev|olence of her &s;oul. The &s;cattered gems glitter with tran&s;cendent lu&s;tre upon the dark clouds in which &s;he is enveloped; and it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to conceive a more calamitous &s;ituation, than to be marked down the hourly witne&s;s of her plaintive &s;orrows. Yet this ta&s;k is a&s;&s;igned to a fond, an aged, and a widowed mother. To other hands &s;he refu&s;eth to relinqui&s;h the care of her poor unfortunate! "No mercenary hireling" &s;he exclaims, "&s;hall inflict upon my gentle child, unnece&s;&s;ary &s;ufferings. It is enough, that the blo&s;&s;oms of her youth have been thus untimely blight|ed. It is the part of her mother to &s;oothe, as far as circum&s;tances will admit, her woe &s;tricken &s;pirit; and no earthly con&s;ideration &s;hall induce me to yield my melancholy charge, or quit for a &s;ingle hour my faultle&s;s mourner!" Every night her bed is prepared in the apartment of her daughter; and &s;he takes no &s;u&s;tenance but what &s;he receives in her pre&s;ence. Alas! alas! what a heart piercing contra&s;t is mo|mently exhibited, to tho&s;e &s;cenes which &s;he had con|templated as unveiling to her declining life, when, in the full enjoyment of her complacent hours, the chil|dren of her beloved daughter pa&s;&s;ed in vi&s;ion before her.</P>

Lavinia, like another Maria, is &s;uffered to wander over the grounds which make a part of her paternal inheritance.

<P>IT appears that the declaration of Mi&s;s Clifford's marriage, has an&s;wered only one part of the letter of my fair corre&s;pondent, Mi&s;s Monimia Ca&s;talio; and, as I make a point of paying the mo&s;t minute at|tention to the epi&s;tles addre&s;&s;ed to me in my official capacity, before I commence my re&s;pon&s;es to the wor|thy Mrs. Aimwell, I will briefly reply to the remain|ing query contained in that addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ee&mdash;Mi&s;s Monimia Ca&s;talio and Mi&s;s Prim|ro&s;e wi&s;h to know, what the ladies Hamilton and Sey|mour think of <HI>naked elbows;</HI> whether they have thrown a&s;ide their <HI>mode&s;ty pieces,</HI> and whether they dre&s;s their <HI>wai&s;ts as &s;hort</HI> as <HI>Mrs. Modi&s;h</HI> &s;ays they do? Now, that I may give to my anxious inquirers every po&s;&s;ible gratification, I &s;hall an&s;wer their queries both <HI>generally</HI> and <HI>particularly:</HI> And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>generally.</HI> It is not true, that the ladies are in the habit of employing <HI>Mrs. Modi&s;h.</HI> It is notori|ous,
<PB N="60" REF="034162_0406_0FFC6AA3A5C0E2F0">
that this <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> excellent modeller, at <HI>all times pertinaciou&s;ly</HI> in&s;i&s;ts upon her own whims, however ab|&s;urd and fanta&s;tical they may chance to be, and that &s;he frequently precipitates her determined votaries in|to the mo&s;t ridiculous vagaries. Margaretta and Sera|fina take a cur&s;ory view of her followers, and adopt only &s;uch regulations as are proper and becoming; they are never fond of extremes; and hence the &s;ud|den tran&s;itions of fa&s;hion cannot produce them <HI>outr&eacute;e figures.</HI> If a particular colour is &s;aid to be the <HI>rage,</HI> and it does not happen to &s;uit their complexions, they do not impo&s;e upon them&s;elves the nece&s;&s;ity of wear|ing it; their ambition is, to di&s;play their fine features and per&s;ons to the be&s;t advantage, and this their pre|dominant wi&s;h in dre&s;s is never pro&s;trated to any in|ferior con&s;ideration; they have no violent de&s;ire to be con&s;idered as the <HI>&s;tandards</HI> of mode, or to be exalt|ed to the <HI>&s;ummit of ta&s;te;</HI> they have heard a favourite poet &s;ay, that
<Q><L>Beauty, when unadorn'd, is then adorn'd the mo&s;t;</L></Q>
and, following the example of all other commentators, they contrive that the text &s;hould &s;quare exactly with <HI>their own ideas previou&s;ly conceived;</HI> they produce it as an antidote to all extravagance in the materials or modification of their habiliments; di&s;carding <HI>pomp,</HI> they adopt <HI>elegance,</HI> and generally appear as if attired by the Graces.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>particularly.</HI> I have never heard them give an opinion relative to <HI>naked elbows;</HI> but, &s;ince the reque&s;t of Mi&s;s Monimia Ca&s;talio, I have accu|rately ob&s;erved their &s;leeves, or, to &s;peak more tech|nically, the dre&s;s of their arms, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my good Mary, I may perhaps pre&s;ent an intelligi|ble view of this &s;ection of their garments. It &s;eems they have never worn long &s;leeves, except when rid|ing; and hence, it will rationally enough be conclud|ed, they have no violent predilection for a long &s;leeve; but I will whi&s;per in the ear of my fair readers, a truth to which they may not perhaps immediately recur&mdash;

<HI>they have uncommonly fine arms:</HI> Their &s;leeve, then, de|&s;cending one quarter of an inch, more or le&s;s, below that well turned curvature <HI>y'clepped</HI> an elbow, there re|ceives its graceful &s;lope, the extreme edge being orna|mented with mu&s;lin, &s;light gauze, blond, or Bru&s;&s;els, as may &s;uit the quality of the gown, or the occa&s;ion on which it is to be worn. They have not thrown a&s;ide <HI>their veils of mode&s;ty</HI>&mdash;God forbid they ever &s;hould&mdash;but with regard to <HI>mode&s;ty pieces, &s;o called,</HI> in all their varieties, or tho&s;e parapets upon parapets, behind which brea&s;t-work the fair intrencher &s;eems to challenge the attack&mdash;as a &s;ub|&s;titute for all the&s;e, their delicate mu&s;lin, &s;imply edged with a border, varied agreeably to the elegance of their fancy, is drawn round the neck, and fa&s;tened with a knot of ribbon behind, over which the handkerchief receives a form &s;omewhat conformable to the reigning ta&s;te. For their wai&s;ts, as they never appeared like <HI>inverted cones, &s;o their &s;kirts have not yet obtained an addi|tional half yard in length, for the purpo&s;e of u&s;urping that part of the body where the blond tucker formerly obtained a &s;tation.</HI> If the ladies make up a new dre&s;s, they &s;o far conde&s;cend to the then fa&s;hion, as not to render them&s;elves con&s;picuous for their non-conformity; and I believe this piece of accommodation makes up the &s;um total of their compliance with the fa&s;hionable world.</P>
<P>Thus having adju&s;ted, as I conceive, this <HI>important</HI> particular, I turn with plea&s;urable alacrity to the ma|ternal epi&s;tle of the truly de&s;erving Mrs. Aimwell. Tremblingly alive to every thing which can affect her beautiful charge, does not Mrs. Aimwell too readily admit tho&s;e corroding apprehen&s;ions which undermine her peace? She confe&s;&s;eth that nature hath been liber|al, and that the mind of her daughter is exempt from tho&s;e adver&s;e inclinations which too often, even in the bo&s;om of childhood, become fearfully productive. Ought &s;he not then to felicitate her&s;elf upon the happy di&s;po&s;ition of her Sophia? I pronounce that patience and per&s;everance will perfect her wi&s;hes. Mi&s;s Aim|well hath but recently attained her twelfth year. It is
<PB N="62" REF="034162_0408_0FFA654C1304CA28">
rather early to expect a love of uniformity, and a pur|&s;uit of regularity, <HI>as a matter of choice.</HI> The &s;ea&s;on of youth is happily marked by vivacity; and the playful candidates for more &s;ub&s;tantial good are filled with intere&s;ting wonder at every novel &s;cene that comes un|der their ob&s;ervation. They love to walk, &s;et, or &s;tand, preci&s;ely as an imagination which does not readily &s;ubmit to the &s;ober agency of rea&s;on, &s;hall dic|tate. The young lady in que&s;tion at pre&s;ent, takes rank among this little eccentric cla&s;s of beings; but under the judicious au&s;pices of Mrs. Aimwell, &s;he will eventually become that accompli&s;hed female, who will exhibit an exact tran&s;cript of the model already form|ed in the mind of her excellent mother.</P>
<P>Yes, indeed, I do conceive that the hand of &s;kilful cultivation may implant an ardent thir&s;t for knowl|edge; or, in other words, a love of reading in that mind of which it was not the original growth; nay, further, I affirm, upon the authority of experience, that the u&s;eful and fertile exotic will take as deep root, flouri&s;h as luxuriantly, and produce as plentiful a har|ve&s;t, as in its native &s;oil; and perhaps the conforma|tion of this artificial ta&s;te, is one of the <HI>mo&s;t eligible u&s;es which can be made of novel reading.</HI> Curio&s;ity in the minds of young people is generally if not always up|on the wing; and I have regarded curio&s;ity, combined with nece&s;&s;ity, as the grand &s;tamina of almo&s;t every improvement. Narrative, unencumbered with dry re|flections, and adorned with all the flowers of fiction, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es for the new plumed fancy a mo&s;t fa&s;cinating charm; attention is arre&s;ted, every faculty of the &s;oul is engaged, and the pages of the intere&s;ting and en|tertaining noveli&s;t are almo&s;t devoured. Thus an at|tachment to reading is formed, and this primary ob|ject once obtained, in that paucity of tho&s;e kind of writings, <HI>which the watchful parent will know how to create,</HI> the entertaining biographer will become an acceptable &s;ub&s;titute; the tran&s;ition to hi&s;tory will be in cour&s;e; geography con&s;titutes an e&s;&s;ential part of hi&s;tory; and the annals of the heavenly bodies will ul|timately

be &s;tudied with avidity. Pope's Homer may originate a ta&s;te for poetry, even in the very &s;oul of frigidity; and a peru&s;al of the beautifully diver&s;ified and richly ornamented numbers of the Adventurer, induces a perigrination through every e&s;&s;ay which has been written, from the days of their great primogeni|tures, Steele and Addi&s;on, down to the &s;imple num|bers of the humble Gleaner. In this view, novels may be con&s;idered as rendering an important &s;ervice to &s;ociety; and I que&s;tion whether there is not le&s;s ri&s;k in placing volumes of this kind in the hands of girls of <HI>ten or twelve years of age,</HI> than during that in|tere&s;ting period which revolves from <HI>fifteen to twenty.</HI> The mind is in&s;tructed with much more facility, at an early age, than afterwards; and I have thought that many a complete letter writer has been produced from the &s;chool of the noveli&s;t; and hence, po&s;&s;ibly, it is, that females have acquired &s;o palpable a &s;uperiority over us, in this elegant and u&s;eful art. Novels, I think, may very properly and advantageou&s;ly con&s;titute the <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> of a girl from <HI>eight to fourteen years of age, provided always that &s;he pur&s;ues her reading under the ju|dicious direction of her guardian friend:</HI> By the time &s;he hath completed her fourteenth year, (&s;uppo&s;ing the voice of well-judged and tender premonition has occa&s;ion|ally &s;ounded in her ears) I am mi&s;taken if her under|&s;tanding will not have made &s;uch progre&s;s, as to give her to ri&s;e from the table with proper ideas of the light|ne&s;s of the repa&s;t; of the frivolity of tho&s;e &s;cenes to which &s;he hath attended; of their in&s;ufficiency, as &s;ources of that kind of information which is the off|&s;pring of truth, and of their inability to be&s;tow <HI>real knowledge,</HI> or tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial qualities that nerve the mind, and endow it with the fortitude &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in the career of life.</P>
<P>Under the requi&s;ite guidance, &s;he will learn properly to appreciate the heroes and heroines of the noveli&s;t; repetition will create &s;atiety, and &s;he will have ri&s;en from the banquet before the con&s;equences of her intox|ication can materially injure her future life. She will

have drank largely, it is true, but revolving hours will give her to recover from her inebriety, and happily tho&s;e hours will intervene ere yet &s;he is called to act the part a&s;&s;igned her; and &s;he will have extracted every advan|tage within the reach of po&s;&s;ibility, from this line of reading, while the pernicious effects attributed thereto, can in no re&s;pect e&s;&s;entially hurt her.</P>
<P>When a torrent of novels bur&s;ts &s;uddenly on a girl, who, bidding adieu to childhood, hath already entered a career, to her of &s;uch va&s;t importance, the evils of which they may be productive are indeed incalculable! aided by a glowing imagination, &s;he will take a deep intere&s;t in the fa&s;cinating enthu&s;ia&s;m they in&s;pire; each gilded illu&s;ion will pa&s;s for a &s;plendid reality; <HI>&s;he will &s;igh to become the heroine of the drama; and, &s;electing her hero, it is po&s;&s;ible &s;he may be precipitated into irremediable evil, before &s;he may have learned to make a ju&s;t e&s;timation of the glittering trifles, by which &s;he is thus captivated.</HI> I &s;ay, therefore, I would confine novels to girls from eight to fourteen years of age; and I would then lay them by, for the amu&s;ement of tho&s;e vacant hours, which, in advanced years, are frequently marked by a kind of <HI>ennui,</HI> the re&s;ult, probably, of a &s;eparation from tho&s;e companions, with whom we have filled the more bu&s;y &s;cenes of life.</P>
<P>I grant that novels, under proper direction, might be made much more exten&s;ively &s;ub&s;ervient to the well being of &s;ociety, than, <HI>with a very few exceptions,</HI> they have ever yet been. Was not <HI>love, unconquerable, unchanging, and omnipotent, their everla&s;ting theme,</HI> they might abound with precepts and examples conducive to the be&s;t of purpo&s;es. This remark leads to the con&s;ideration of the que&s;tion propo&s;ed by my anxious corre&s;pondent. <HI>In my toleration of novels, have I not exerci&s;ed a di&s;criminating power?</HI> Mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly I have. There is a cla&s;s of novels, and of plays, which it ap|pears to me &s;hould be burnt by the hands of the com|mon executioner; and were it not that the <HI>good natured world</HI> generally takes part with the &s;ufferer, I could

wi&s;h to &s;ee &s;trong marks of public odium affixed upon the authors of tho&s;e libidinous productions.</P>
<P>But it is as painful to dwell upon &s;ubjects of repre|hen&s;ion as it is plea&s;urable to hold the pen of pane|gyric&mdash;let me ha&s;ten, therefore, to a &s;election which I have conceived indi&s;putably worthy of preference; and, in the fir&s;t grade of tho&s;e writings, that take rank under the general de&s;cription of novels, and that are entitled to the highe&s;t notes of eulogy, I have been accu&s;tomed to place the hi&s;tory of Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe.</P>
<P>In my decided approbation of this admired pro|duction, I have the &s;atisfaction to reflect that I am not &s;ingular. My paternal grand-father, who was one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters of the era in which he lived, indulged, perhaps to exce&s;s, an invincible aver|&s;ion to novels. Yet, the Holy Bible and Clari&s;&s;a Har|lowe, were the books in which he accu&s;tomed his daughters to read alternately, during tho&s;e hours in which he attended to them him&s;elf. The Rev. James Hervey, Rector of We&s;ton Favell, in Northampton|&s;hire in England, celebrated as well for an exemplary life and purity of manners, as for the elegance and piety of his literary compo&s;itions, in a treati&s;e written upon the education of daughters, recommends Clari&s;&s;a, as a &s;uitable pre&s;ent to tho&s;e young ladies, who are to be trained in the paths of virtue and propriety; and a <HI>late writer,</HI> has a&s;&s;erted, that Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe is the <HI>fir&s;t human production now extant.</HI> He he&s;itates not to place it, for <HI>literary excellence, above the Iliad of Homer, or any other work, ancient or modern, the &s;acred oracles excepted.</HI></P>
<P>But without taking it upon me to defend this opin|ion. I will only &s;ay, that it appears to me admirably well calculated as a u&s;eful companion for a female, from the fir&s;t dawn of her rea&s;on, to the clo&s;ing &s;cene of life. It has been &s;aid that many a Lovelace has availed him&s;elf of plots, fabricated and developed in tho&s;e volumes, which would never el&s;e have entered his imagination&mdash;be it &s;o, I only contend for the placing them in female hands; and I affirm that they con|tain
<PB N="66" REF="034162_0412_0FFC6A955C3154B8">
the be&s;t code of regulations, the be&s;t directions in every &s;ituation which they exemplify&mdash;in one word, the be&s;t model for the &s;ex, that I have ever yet &s;een pourtrayed. The character of Clari&s;&s;a, it has been a&s;|&s;erted, is too highly wrought: but I a&s;k, what perfec|tion did &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s that we &s;hould be willing to di&s;|pen&s;e with, in the female, who we &s;hould delineate as an accompli&s;hed woman! Was I to advance an objection again&s;t a work of &s;uch acknowledged merit, I would &s;ay that it is the character of Lovelace, and more par|ticularly of the Sinclairs, the Martins, the Hortons, and the Harlowes, of tho&s;e pages, which are <HI>too highly wrought.</HI> It is &s;urely much more ea&s;y to conceive of an amiable woman, acting preci&s;ely as did Clari&s;&s;a, than of that degree of turpitude and inexorable &s;e|verity, which mu&s;t have preceded the perpetration of actions &s;o black, and the manife&s;tation of rigour &s;o ill &s;ounded and unrelenting.</P>
<P>It has been generally imagined that Clari&s;&s;a's only deviation from &s;trict propriety, con&s;i&s;ted in her flight from the protection of her father; but a moment's re|flection will evince the error of this conclu&s;ion&mdash;<HI>that cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e a fault to which I am compelled.</HI> Clari&s;&s;a met her betrayer with a de&s;ign to remon&s;trate, and to con|ciliate, but with a <HI>determined re&s;olution not to abandon the paternal man&s;ion;</HI> it appears that &s;he was precipi|tated upon that fatal &s;tep, and, environed by the deep laid machination of the deceiver, her e&s;cape would have been miraculous, yet &s;he continued to &s;truggle, and even at the moment &s;he was hurried away, the beauteous &s;ufferer &s;till vehemently prote&s;ted again&s;t accompanying the wretch, who was armed for her de&s;truction. Clari&s;&s;a's <HI>error</HI> (<HI>if indeed, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, &s;he was ever in any &s;ort reprehen&s;ible</HI>) mu&s;t be traced further back; it con&s;i&s;ted in her <HI>corre&s;pondence after the parental prohibition, and in her con&s;enting to meet the treacherous villain.</HI> Yet, when we take a view of the <HI>motives</HI> which &s;timulated her to tho&s;e deci&s;ive mea&s;ures, we can &s;carcely deem her cen&s;urable; and
<PB N="67" REF="034162_0413_0FFC6A93A018B0A8">
&s;he extorts from every bo&s;om that kind of applau&s;e, which we &s;pontaneou&s;ly yield to per&s;ecuted merit.</P>
<P>Love, in the bo&s;om of Clari&s;&s;a, was always &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to virtue. It would never have taken the lead of duty; and, had &s;he been left to the free exerci&s;e of her fine faculties, had &s;he been permitted to call into action tho&s;e rare abilities of which &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he would have <HI>completely extricated her&s;elf from every embarra&s;&s;ment.</HI> Love, in the bo&s;om of Clari&s;&s;a, was the <HI>noble&s;t of principles;</HI> it was uniformly &s;olicitous for the <HI>genuine felicity, e&s;tabli&s;hment and elevation of its object;</HI> but it would never have permitted her to have allied her&s;elf to a man, who could <HI>barbarou&s;ly triumph in the de&s;truction of that &s;weet peace of mind, which is the bo&s;om friend of the innocent and of the good; who could inhuman|ly meditate the ruin of tho&s;e confiding females who were en|titled to his pity and his protection.</HI> Liberated from the re&s;entment of her hard hearted relations, and moving in that enlarged and elevated &s;phere, to which her matchle&s;s intellect and uncommon information en|titled her, &s;he would doubtle&s;s have inve&s;tigated. The libertine would inevitably have &s;tood confe&s;&s;ed, and would as a&s;&s;uredly have been di&s;carded from her fa|vour. In one word, love, in the bo&s;om of Clari&s;&s;a, was what I wi&s;h, from my &s;oul, it may become in the bo&s;om of every female.</P>
<P>The deportment of Clari&s;&s;a, after Lovelace had &s;o artfully betrayed her into a &s;tep which her judgment invariably condemned, has been the &s;ubject of much cavilling; &s;he is accu&s;ed of undue haughtine&s;s; but &s;urely &s;uch cen&s;urers have not well weighed either her character and &s;ituation, or that ambiguous mode of conduct, which the de&s;poiler &s;o early a&s;&s;umed. How often did he <HI>hold her &s;oul in &s;u&s;pen&s;e,</HI> and how nece&s;&s;ary was it for his nefarious purpo&s;es thus to do.</P>
<P>But I am not now writing a critici&s;m upon Clari&s;&s;a; the foregoing hints will inform Mrs. Aimwell what cla&s;s of novels I particularly approbate; and I proceed, agreeably to her reque&s;t, to &s;elect a few of tho&s;e let|ters, which made a part of the corre&s;pondence be|tween

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>NO courier ever produced a letter with an air of greater importance than did our boy Plato, when, ten moments &s;ince, he handed me yours. Indeed he &s;eems much elated with his new office; and I freely own to you, my dear girl, that I am fond of giving plea&s;ure even to Plato. When plea&s;ure re&s;ults from duty, as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, it can hardly be en|joyed too luxuriantly. Tho&s;e beings who are fre|quently &s;ubjected to the caprice of the petty tyrants whom they &s;erve, derive their exi&s;tence from the &s;ame &s;ource with their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; their de&s;tina|tion is al&s;o &s;imilar to ours; and, con&s;idering the natur|al love of liberty which predominates more or le&s;s in every human bo&s;om, and the pangs which mu&s;t con&s;e|quently re&s;ult from &s;ervitude, it is a duty incumbent upon us to render that &s;tate of &s;ubordination in which &s;ervants are providentially placed, as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible. Reflection will &s;ugge&s;t the policy of this conduct, con|&s;idered in every view; and as the face of things is continually changing, and it is difficult to &s;ay what events time may produce&mdash;our fate may, in future, remain with him, who is to day under our direction: At any rate, if we would in&s;ure to our&s;elves a fund of plea&s;ing reflections, we mu&s;t trea&s;ure up tho&s;e proper and becoming actions, which will alone &s;tand the te&s;t of accurate inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>I thank you, my love, for your letter: It is a charm|ing &s;pecimen of what I am to expect in future; and as you have &s;o well profited by my premonitory addre&s;s, I calculate upon your continued docility, and antici|pate from this corre&s;pondence the mo&s;t de&s;irable con|&s;equences.</P>

feelings of my &s;ympathetic bo&s;om are beyond expre&s;|&s;ion. The de&s;cription of the waking infant is highly fini&s;hed: I behold, in idea, the long dark eye-la&s;hes, &s;uddenly contra&s;ted by tho&s;e mildly beaming &s;plendors, which produced upon the paternal Count &s;uch enchant|ing effects. In &s;hort, the whole of that animated page is truly charming; and I will confe&s;s to you, my dear, that it is with pa&s;&s;ages of this complexion, I am mo&s;t plea&s;ed in the Count de Poland.</P>
<P>Ah! my Margaretta, I once had a brother!&mdash;que&s;|tion me not relative to this brother. His fraternal bo|&s;om is now as in&s;en&s;ate as the cold by which it is cov|ered; his mind was the &s;eat of every virtue. Had he lived&mdash;but I forbear&mdash;Let me not pre&s;s upon the &s;weet bud of your opening youth, with tho&s;e deeply &s;urcharged &s;orrows, which a retro&s;pect would occa|&s;ion&mdash;let me drop over them the impenetrable veil of &s;ilence!!!</P>
<P>With the maternal character of Mrs. O&s;mond, and with the di&s;cretion of Lady Edgerton, I am much plea&s;ed: But it is not the fault of noveli&s;ts, to be nig|gard of the virtues or the graces to tho&s;e characters which they produce as objects of admiration. Hold|ing the pen of di&s;tribution, it is ea&s;y for them to com|mand an a&s;&s;emblage of every excellence; and the&s;e &s;plendid habiliments, <HI>never impaired by u&s;e,</HI> will &s;uit as well the hero or heroine of the pre&s;ent era, as tho&s;e who figured centuries ago. <HI>The pecuniary fund of the noveli&s;t is al&s;o inexhau&s;tible,</HI> and the liberality of tho&s;e endowments, drawn therefrom, is only bounded by that &s;en&s;e of probability, which happens to exi&s;t in the mind of the munificent conferer of tho&s;e a&euml;rial be&s;tow|ments. To &s;ay truth, my love, that particular, which &s;eems lea&s;t to have commanded your attention, in the Count de Poland, is preci&s;ely <HI>that which, in my opinion, con&s;titutes its principal value;</HI> it is a trait rarely met with in works of this kind; but it is, neverthele&s;s, &s;u&s;|ceptible of high improvement; and was it often dwelt on, exemplified, and richly coloured, it would proba|bly produce, upon the mind of the youthful reader, the
<PB N="71" REF="034162_0417_0FFC6A865D679E50">
mo&s;t beneficial effect. Are you at a lo&s;s to compre|hend me? I will be more explicit. <HI>I mean the com|plete triumph, which Lord Harenbrook and Lady Morpeth obtained over an incon&s;iderate attachment, that &s;eemed vio|lently to have tempe&s;ted the mind of the enamoured &s;wain, and to have made no incon&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion upon the heart of the fa&s;hionable nymph.</HI> Her recovery from tho&s;e paths of di&s;&s;ipation, into which &s;he had been betrayed by a pernicious plan of education, is truly acceptable to the intere&s;ted reader; and the <HI>grateful attachment,</HI> which, it is apparent, &s;he ultimately conceives for Lord Mor|peth, is a completion of her character.</P>
<P>Indeed, nothing can be imagined more ab&s;urd, than the endowing a ha&s;ty predilection, formed in <HI>childhood,</HI> or at be&s;t, in the days of <HI>inexperienced youth,</HI> with <HI>invin|cibility!</HI> I do not &s;ay that &s;uch attachments are al|ways improper: If they are approved of, after accu|rate inve&s;tigation, and crowned by the &s;anction of guardian friends, their permanency is de&s;irable, and we ought &s;tudiou&s;ly to cultivate every &s;entiment which can contribute to their e&s;tabli&s;hment. But the <HI>election</HI> of the <HI>uninformed</HI> mind is &s;eldom <HI>judicious,</HI> and the <HI>im|mortality</HI> which we confer thereon, exi&s;ts no where but in an over-heated imagination. <HI>A happy marriage</HI> is nothing el&s;e but the <HI>highe&s;t &s;tate of friend&s;hip,</HI> of which the &s;ons and daughters of mortality are capable; and, in the choice of a companion for life, <HI>perfect e&s;teem</HI> &s;hould point the election. If you di&s;cover either of the young ladies, to whom your gentle bo&s;om is already &s;o tenderly attached, to be unworthy of your regard, although &s;he may &s;till be followed by your anxious wi&s;hes for her re&s;toration to virtue, yet you will no longer confer on her your <HI>confidence;</HI> and, was the &s;ame <HI>re&s;olution</HI> in exerci&s;e, a di&s;covery of the want of merit in the object, <HI>until then beloved,</HI> would as ea&s;ily <HI>obliterate</HI> the attachment exi&s;ting between the &s;exes, and we &s;hould &s;hrink from the idea of embarking on the important voyage of life, without the rich cargo of e&s;teem.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO arre&s;t the warm affections of the youthful voyager, very little addre&s;s is requi&s;ite. Ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions, the opening mind generally e&s;timates per&s;ons and things, with the benefits which accrue therefrom, agreeably to its own vivid imagina|tion; and its calculations, accumulated by a productive fancy, highly o'ertop the judgment of rea&s;on. Grat|itude, if not &s;pontaneous, is implanted in the glowing bo&s;om, almo&s;t without an effort; and <HI>affection, &s;tamped by gratitude,</HI> is a &s;ub&s;tantial ba&s;is for the &s;uper&s;tructure of education. To convince young people of our en|tire attachment, and that all our views, and every ar|rangement relative to them, are directed to their pre&s;|ent and future advancement, is <HI>indi&s;putably</HI> of the greate&s;t importance. Children will receive le&s;&s;ons with confidence and advantage, from the lips of tho&s;e who&s;e tender attachment they do not con&s;ider as prob|lematical; and reciprocity of regards, between the teacher and the taught, is ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>Happily, in the mind of Margaretta, an indelible conviction of our unalterable and di&s;intere&s;ted attach|ment was early produced; and a reciprocation of re|gards, a decided preference, and even veneration, for our characters, with that calm repo&s;ing confidence,
<PB N="73" REF="034162_0419_0FFC6A81A5C9EF58">
which naturally re&s;ults from affection &s;o entire, and e&s;teem which &s;he conceived &s;o well grounded, origin|ated in her gentle bo&s;om the warme&s;t &s;en&s;ations, and ultimately procured the very be&s;t effect. Many of her letters are too expre&s;&s;ive of the impa&s;&s;ioned feelings of a fervid and enthu&s;ia&s;tically grateful heart, to meet the public eye; and, as Mrs. Aimwell requires only a &s;pecimen, I am at liberty to &s;uppre&s;s them; &s;electing others, as they may happen to occur, without attend|ing to the order in which they were written.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR MAMMA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO not know that there is &s;o happy a being in this world, as your little Margaretta. Your letters, be&s;t of friends, are more plea&s;ing to me than I can find words to expre&s;s. Alas! alas! who would have thought it?&mdash;When my aunt Arbuthnot u&s;ed to weep over me, apprehending that &s;he &s;hould leave her poor child quite friendle&s;s, &s;he would &s;igh as if her heart would bur&s;t; and I, for my part, had no wi&s;h, but to go to &s;leep on the dear bo&s;om of her, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be my mother, and never, never more to wake in a world, where I thought there was no one to cheri&s;h and to love the poor little creature, who was &s;o &s;oon to be deprived of her only friend! Were any one now to &s;ee the rich joyful Margaretta, as happy as the days are long, would it be po&s;&s;ible to conceive her the &s;ame little de&s;titute child, who &s;hed &s;o many tears in Mrs. Thrifty's hou&s;e in Charle&s;ton? Dear me!&mdash;the <HI>big waves &s;wallowed up my father!&mdash;my mother broke her poor heart!&mdash;and my aunt too, very &s;oon followed to that better world, whence &s;he can no more return, and ev|ery body &s;aid, there was no one remained to take care of me!</HI>&mdash;But God has &s;ent two ble&s;&s;ed angels to take charge of me; and for this I will pro&s;trate my&s;elf be|fore him every morning and evening, and love and honour him all my days.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="034162_0420_0FFC6A801B539B00">
Well now, I think, if I &s;hould be a third time or|phanaged, I &s;hould never again hold up my head! You know, mamma, <HI>you have taught me</HI> to make <HI>ob&s;er|vations</HI> and <HI>compari&s;ons;</HI> and &s;o, &s;tanding in the bow window the other day, I could not help weeping at the fate of the plant, which we have &s;o long cheri&s;hed and watched with &s;o much care. It was the la&s;t &s;tormy day&mdash;and, although it had &s;tood upright during the burning heat of &s;ummer, and the heavy rains of au|tumn, yet, the torrent that bur&s;t upon it from the fir&s;t wintry &s;torm, &s;tripped it of all its leaves, and levelled it with the earth, from which it has never &s;ince lifted its head. Ju&s;t &s;o, thought I, it would fare with thee, Margaretta; thou ha&s;t &s;urvived the lo&s;s of thy parents, and of thy &s;econd mother; but, if envious death &s;hould deprive thee of thy pre&s;ent guardian friends, thou mu&s;t never think to look abroad again; thou mu&s;t lie down with the pro&s;trate plant, and all thy fine expectations will be trodden to the ground! Dear me! my tears fell like big drops of rain. You remember, my mam|ma, that you had the goodne&s;s to wipe them away with your own handkerchief, that you ki&s;&s;ed my cheek, and wi&s;hed to know the cau&s;e of my &s;orrow. I could not then &s;peak&mdash;but I determined to write you about it&mdash;they were partly tears of joy, and partly of &s;or|row&mdash;of joy, for the pre&s;ent; and of &s;orrow, for what may happen; but your indulgent &s;miles &s;oon left nothing in my little heart but joy and gladne&s;s. Cer|tainly, as Mrs. Trueworth &s;ays, if I am not the be&s;t, I &s;hall be the wor&s;t young body in all this world; and if I &s;hould ever be ungrateful to you or my papa, I &s;hall de&s;erve the di&s;plea&s;ure of every good per&s;on.</P>
<P>Lady Morpeth's di&s;re&s;pect for her excellent parents &s;urpri&s;ed me very much; and although I was plea&s;ed with her fine qualities, yet, on account of this circum|&s;tance, it was &s;ome time before I could be reconciled to her character&mdash;But what a &s;hocking woman was Lady Ann Fo&s;te&s;s! <HI>Are there &s;uch ladies in England as Lady Ann Fo&s;te&s;s?</HI> fie upon them, if there are! I am &s;ure they are not worthy to be called ladies;
<PB N="75" REF="034162_0421_0FFC6A7D6C26BFE8">
and if they are, in reality, to be found in Old Eng|land, how happy am I that I have e&s;caped to this new world, where <HI>&s;incerity and kindne&s;s are created king and queer, and where all their &s;ubjects obey their laws.</HI> I wi&s;h, mamma, you had written me your &s;entiments of Lady Ann&mdash;I am &s;ure you mu&s;t dete&s;t her.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t I &s;hall never have a friend whom you do not approve; and you &s;peak the very heart and &s;oul of your Margaretta, when you &s;ay, that if any of my a&s;&s;ociates were to addict them&s;elves to tho&s;e habits, which you and my dear papa have pointed out to me as reprehen&s;ible, I &s;hould immediately become de&s;ir|ous of &s;eparating my&s;elf from them, however dear they might have been to me; and I do believe it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould continue to love tho&s;e, whom you a&s;&s;ure me are unworthy of my attention.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Hayden has been diverting her&s;elf this hour pa&s;t, with what &s;he calls our <HI>funny</HI> corre&s;pondence; &s;he ru&s;hed into my chamber, (you know &s;he vi&s;its when and where &s;he plea&s;es, without ever thinking it nece&s;|&s;ary to a&s;k her mamma's permi&s;&s;ion) having found her way up the back &s;tairs, ju&s;t as I was preparing to write. She had not &s;topped to put on either hat or &s;carf, and her appearance was &s;o wild, that it ab&s;olute|ly frightened me!

<P>THE <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of uttering to my Margaretta the lan|guage of cen&s;ure, of penning the line of reprehen&s;ion, will ever inflict upon my own bo&s;om, pangs corre&s;pon|dent with, if not &s;uperior to, tho&s;e which &s;he may, up|on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, experience. Contrary to my wonted cu&s;tom, I deny my&s;elf the indulgence of re&s;ponding to your la&s;t epi&s;tle in cour&s;e. Your account of Mi&s;s Hay|den is &s;o <HI>foreign from your u&s;ual &s;tyle,</HI> &s;o unlike every trait I have hitherto ob&s;erved in a mind, of which I had <HI>conceived I had obtained an intimate knowledge,</HI> and, altogether, &s;o extraordinary, as to demand my fir&s;t and undivided attention.

<P>"Mi&s;s Hayden ru&s;hed into your chamber without hat or &s;carf."

<P><PB N="77" REF="034162_0423_0FFC6A77386312E8">
I would have my girl regard the faults that may pa&s;s under her ob&s;ervation, as <HI>cautionary occurrences,</HI> that may direct her to avoid the rocks on which too many have &s;plit; but &s;he mu&s;t not be <HI>eager to detect, nor ha&s;ty to expo&s;e.</HI> If, from whatever motive, there has not been that plan in the education of Mi&s;s Hay|den, without which, <HI>&s;carce any thing valuable can be achieved,</HI> is &s;he not therefore inve&s;ted with a claim to your kind commi&s;eration?

Early accu&s;tom|ed properly to appreciate time, &s;he would not then have &s;lumbered away her hours in bed, but each re|turning morning, as it gilded the ea&s;tern &s;ky, would have witne&s;&s;ed the glad ori&s;ons of the lovely maiden, would have marked in its progre&s;s tho&s;e habits of in|du&s;try &s;o proper, and &s;o becoming, e&s;pecially to the &s;ea&s;on of youth.

Of <HI>inju&s;tice,</HI> becau&s;e, as I have ju&s;t hinted, we thereby condemn, or make an individual &s;uffer, for a circum&s;tance not to be avoided, and which the voli|tion of the being, who&s;e misfortune we thus aggra|vate, was no how acce&s;&s;ary in procuring.

e&s;caped your lips, it is beyond your control, and while it may inflict the deepe&s;t wounds, a remedy re|maineth not in your gift; you can only lament the melancholy effects of your indi&s;cretion. Often, al&s;o, have I known the tale of &s;lander to implant in the bo|&s;om of the propagator its deadly talons, and the un|wary detractor hath him&s;elf become the ultimate &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>But to dwell on the evils of detraction, would require powers more energetic than words can command. De|traction is the fir&s;t-born of envy, the fiend of &s;ociety, and the fell de&s;poiler of hone&s;t &s;ame. <HI>Beware</HI> then, my child, of its blighting influence; let your friend Mi&s;s Clifford al&s;o <HI>beware, for there is not a calamity written in the book of adver&s;ity, of which it may not be productive.</HI> I am fearful you have treated Mi&s;s Hay|den unkindly. I recollect when &s;he quitted your cham|ber that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the parlour window in tears; and your avowed complacency in her departure, and &s;ub|&s;equent declaration, with that of your friend, relative to her future vi&s;its, abundantly ju&s;tify my &s;u&s;picion. Mi&s;s Hayden is a mild tempered girl, and her ea&s;y good humour, when told of her faults, evinceth the &s;erenity of her di&s;po&s;ition. <HI>To point out faults,</HI> is an office that ought to be &s;acred to that <HI>experience which is the growth of a length of years, or to that tried friend|&s;hip that hath &s;tood the te&s;t of various &s;ituations. Marga|retta Melworth is yet too young to take upon her this impor|tant ta&s;k:</HI> If you can influence your companions by the <HI>propriety</HI> and <HI>beauty</HI> of your <HI>example,</HI> it is well; <HI>admo|nition</HI> and <HI>cen&s;ure, mu&s;t be referred to a riper age.</HI> If you have, indeed, deported your&s;elf with undue re&s;erve, &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s, or mortifying neglect, you have but one way of re&s;toring your&s;elf to my good opinion. Seek Mi&s;s Hayden&mdash;and in your own amiable manner cancel a fault, which I am willing to con&s;ider as pro|ceeding from a want of reflection&mdash;cancel this <HI>e&s;&s;ential deviation from the con&s;i&s;tency of your character,</HI> by conde|&s;cending to <HI>&s;olicit</HI> a reconciliation.

<P>Do not, my daughter, &s;uffer the freedom of my re|marks upon this occa&s;ion, to envelop your future &s;enti|ments and actions in a veil of my&s;tery or <HI>concealment;</HI> &s;eek not to re&s;train the frankne&s;s of your di&s;po&s;ition; but let your lovely bo&s;om be &s;till open to my in&s;pection.

Anxious for the con&s;i&s;tency of her character, I &s;hall, as often as I &s;ee occa&s;ion, freely cor|rect; and while I point out tho&s;e mi&s;takes, upon <HI>which per&s;ons le&s;s intere&s;ted will be &s;ilent, or, perhaps, a&s;&s;ail her ear with the &s;trains of adulation, I &s;hall thereby be&s;t evince my maternal regards.</HI></P>
<P>I am, my dear, enchanted by your letter; and al|though I have ha&s;ted to era&s;e from &s;o fair a page the extraneous blot, I have not been the le&s;s captivated by its beauties.

your di&s;plea&s;ure. I &s;aw, immediately upon my enter|ing the dining parlour this day, that you did not look upon your poor girl exactly as you have heretofore done&mdash;your eye, as it met mine, did not &s;ay, "Mar|garetta, you are a good girl, and I am,"&mdash;as I re|member you have frequently &s;tyled your&s;elf&mdash;"<HI>your approbating mother.</HI>" You called me too, "<HI>Mi&s;s Mel|worth!</HI>"&mdash;and although you looked tenderly upon me, when this coolne&s;s drew from me a &s;igh, which indeed came from the bottom of my trembling bo&s;om, yet I could &s;ee, <HI>too plainly,</HI> that you were not reconciled to me; and I &s;hould immediately have thrown my&s;elf at your dear ble&s;&s;ed feet, entreating you to tell me in what I had offended, and &s;upplicating your forgive|ne&s;s, had I not been &s;ure and certain, that your di&s;ap|probation was occa&s;ioned by my letter, and had you not given it as a rule, that I &s;hould not refer, in con|ver&s;ation, to tho&s;e letters, until the clo&s;e of a corre&s;|pondence &s;o delightful to me. The wonder is, how I continued at table&mdash;but dinner over, I was no longer able to &s;uppre&s;s my emotions, and I flew to my cham|ber to weep over a fault, that I was &s;ure I had com|mitted! Plato followed with your letter&mdash;with trem|bling lips I ki&s;&s;ed the &s;eal&mdash;I ha&s;tened to read, and the rea&s;on for the unu&s;ual reception I had met, was fully explained! I read it over and over again, blu&s;hing and weeping by turns. Ah, mamma! it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever commit a &s;econd error of this kind! Mo&s;t &s;incerely do I de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf, while my mother appears more an angel than before! You are all good|ne&s;s and &s;weet conde&s;cen&s;ion to every body&mdash;every one whom I know has told me this again and again; and be&s;ides, I &s;ee it my&s;elf every day&mdash;how then could I act &s;o very different from my mamma!

<P>Well, but when my poor heart was almo&s;t ready to bur&s;t, I began to &s;ee that there were many lines in your letter, from which I ought to take comfort. You

did not &s;ay, your poor orphan child had <HI>forfeited your good opinion forever</HI>&mdash;no indeed, no &s;uch thing&mdash;there was yet one way left, by which I might again become your <HI>own Margaretta;</HI> and, dropping down on my knees before the chair, (in which you u&s;ually &s;it, when you pa&s;s tho&s;e charming moments in my chamber, that you bid me call the vi&s;its of my maternal friend) I thanked God and my ble&s;&s;ed mother, for the con&s;ola|tion contained in that dear charming line, <HI>that there was yet one way left, by which I might be re&s;tored to your good opinion</HI>&mdash;and jumping upon my feet, I clapped my hands out of pure joy; and &s;o, mamma, I immediate|ly tripped down &s;tairs, <HI>without either hat or &s;carf,</HI> (for I thought it right to puni&s;h that impertinent pride, which had officiou&s;ly brought upon me &s;o much evil) and &s;at off in pur&s;uit of Mi&s;s Hayden. When I en|tered her parlour, I began an apology; but &s;he, not in the lea&s;t attending to what I was about to &s;ay, threw into my arms a little lap-dog, which &s;he &s;aid was the mo&s;t beautiful creature in the world; that her mamma had ju&s;t purcha&s;ed it for her; and, "Margaretta," &s;he added, <Q>you will be plea&s;ed when you hear, that for this one indulgent action of my mamma's, (for &s;he her&s;elf dete&s;ts lap-dogs) I am determined to become the be&s;t girl in the world!

<P>I will confe&s;s to you, my mamma, that I was mor|tified to ob&s;erve Mi&s;s Hayden had thought my rude|ne&s;s <HI>(for indeed it de&s;erves no better name)</HI> below her attention. At that moment I could not forbear ac|knowledging her &s;uperiority; and, had it not been that I mu&s;t have <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from your care,</HI> I would gladly have changed characters with Mi&s;s Hayden; &s;o much did her <HI>manner</HI> of pa&s;&s;ing by my unbecoming conduct, exalt her in my opinion.

<P>Mi&s;s Hayden, notwith&s;tanding Florus was repo&s;ing upon her lap, immediately ro&s;e from her chair, and, throwing her arms about my neck, &s;he bur&s;t into tears! Never, methought, did any one, <HI>except my mam|ma,</HI> appear &s;o lovely.

I thought there could not be a better time to &s;et about <HI>my ref|ormation, as mamma calls it;</HI> and I was rejoiced too, that you thought enough of me to vi&s;it me. With regard to forgivene&s;s, it is too much to &s;ay. I was, I remember, very provoking; I felt uncommon|ly mi&s;chievous.

I produced from my pocket-book your dear letter, and put it into the hands of the young lady with a look of entreaty; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the paper, and pre&s;ented it with inimitable gracefulne&s;s to her mamma. Mrs. Hayden read it and commented upon it, in a way calculated to improve both her daughter and my&s;elf. I have heard you &s;ay, mamma, if I remember right, that Mrs. Hayden is an accompli&s;hed woman: She regret|ted that her Emily had been &s;o little attended to; &s;he wi&s;hed &s;he may be permitted to peru&s;e as many of the letters of a corre&s;pondence &s;o <HI>well judged,</HI> as might con&s;i&s;t with propriety; and, that if it were not too great a favour, &s;he might &s;ometimes be permitted to make one of tho&s;e reading parties, of which &s;he had heard &s;o much, and from which it was evident, Mi&s;s Clifford and my&s;elf had derived &s;uch e&s;&s;ential advan|tages. I ventured to a&s;&s;ure both the ladies, that it would add to the happine&s;s of my mamma, if Mi&s;s Hayden would regularly join us upon our &s;tated read|ing hours, (was I right, mamma?) and &s;he will, ac|cordingly, meet us in the reading parlour when we next a&s;&s;emble. I took my leave, with repeated a&s;&s;ur|ances, that I would endeavour, by future acts of kind|ne&s;s, to cancel the di&s;obligation of the pa&s;t; and, ha&s;|tening to my own apartment, I could not enjoy a mo|ment until I had given you this circum&s;tantial account.</P>
<P>And now, mamma, again kneeling at the chair you have &s;o often filled, I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly &s;upplicate your forgivene&s;s for the trouble I am &s;en&s;ible I mu&s;t have given you. Let me entreat you, in your own charm|ing words, "<HI>Re&s;tore your Margaretta to your good opin|ion;</HI>" for indeed, indeed, &s;he is lo&s;t to every comfort until you do! When I &s;ee you at tea will you again look kindly upon me, ki&s;s my cheek, and call me once more your good little girl? If you a&s;&s;ure me of your full and free pardon, and of your re&s;tored approbation, then will my poor heart leap for joy; and then, and not till then, will your ever dutiful child be again your truly happy</P>

<P>Margaretta, thus receiving permi&s;&s;ion, ru&s;hed in|&s;tantly into our apartment, and &s;uch were the rapidity of her movements, that, ere we were aware, flinging her&s;elf almo&s;t breathle&s;s at the feet of her mother, and cla&s;ping her knees in a kind of exta&s;y, &s;he exhibited a &s;pectacle the mo&s;t charmingly intere&s;ting which can be imagined.

<P>Thus ended an affair, that &s;ome may po&s;&s;ibly regard as a "<HI>much ado about nothing;</HI>" but Mary, availing her|&s;elf of the a&s;cendency &s;he had obtained over the mind of her daughter, <HI>had purpo&s;ely wrought it up to the high|e&s;t

<P>It was the de&s;ign both of Mary and my&s;elf, to pro|duce our daughter, in that career on which &s;he was entering, both theoretically and practically, a philan|thropic morali&s;t.

within the boundaries of virtue; that we erected our &s;tandard of rectitude, and fir&s;t of all, carefully impre&s;&s;ed an idea of the <HI>&s;uperior importance of &s;elf-complacency, and of approving Heaven.</HI> But, having taken down in &s;hort hand, as I was &s;eated at my writing-de&s;k, in a clo&s;et adjoining to Margaretta's, a few disjointed &s;entences, which fell from the lips of my wife, during one of tho&s;e hours appropriated to the in&s;truction of her beloved charge, I tran&s;cribe them from my minutes.</P>
<Q><P>There are, my love, a variety of means, by which you may in&s;ure to your&s;elf the general good wi&s;hes and e&s;teem of all tho&s;e with whom you a&s;&s;ociate; and this, too, without parting with a &s;hilling of your prop|erty, or the &s;malle&s;t inconvenience to your&s;elf. Nay, on the contrary, it may happen that you will thus procure con&s;iderable pecuniary emolument; and you will certainly reap incalculable mental advantages; your bo&s;om will be tranquillized, and you will po&s;&s;e&s;s that harmony of intellect, which few events will be ca|pable of interrupting. But let me be more particular: Avoid engaging warmly as a di&s;putant; deliver your &s;entiments, when called upon, with calmne&s;s and dig|nity; and never a&s;&s;ume a <HI>deci&s;ive</HI> air, or tone of voice.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tom your&s;elf to dilate on plea&s;ing facts; dwell with plea&s;ure on every good action; <HI>advocate the cau&s;e of the ab&s;ent,</HI> and do not &s;uffer your&s;elf to repeat tho&s;e in&s;tances of mi&s;conduct, which you may have heard. Hide the faults which may happen to come under your ob&s;ervation, with as much care as if they were your own; never make them the &s;ubject of your animadver&s;ions, except you have <HI>good ground</HI> for imagining that you &s;hall thereby effectuate &s;ome <HI>valuable purpo&s;e.</HI> Be &s;crupulou&s;ly exact in your ob|&s;ervance of that intercour&s;e of civilities, pronounced, by a certain cla&s;s of people, <HI>e&s;&s;ential to good breeding.</HI> It is true, we may regard tho&s;e ceremonies as trivial; but nothing, <HI>in fact,</HI> can be indifferent, on which the <HI>ine&s;timable enjoyments of &s;ociety are made to depend;</HI> in|deed, a regular ob&s;ervance of punctuality, in every department, will always be recognized as a virtue.</P>

But while I coun&s;el you to be a tenacious ob|&s;erver of the <HI>etiquette,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed in tho&s;e circles in which you may happen to move, as far as it relates to others, being careful, in no in&s;tance, to draw upon your&s;elf the accu&s;ation of neglect, I would wi&s;h you, on your own part, to ri&s;e &s;uperior to tho&s;e, in <HI>reality, little</HI> punctilios; be not ea&s;ily betrayed into re&s;entment; do not indulge an irritable di&s;po&s;ition of mind, nor &s;ub|ject your a&s;&s;ociates to the nece&s;&s;ity of moving as if they trod on gla&s;s, for fear of wounding your feel|ings. There is one rule to which it will be well con|&s;tantly to adhere&mdash;never take offence at any inatten|tion you may have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e unde&s;igned; when you are in reality injured, accept an apology; and let that <HI>mild indulgence, &s;o proper to a being &s;ubjected to error, be ever prominent in your conduct.</HI> With the ex|ample of my grandmother, of celebrious memory, I have been particularly charmed; as often as &s;he found the &s;hafts of &s;lander aimed again&s;t her&s;elf, if the ca|lumniator ranked in the number of her o&s;ten&s;ible friends, it was her cu&s;tom to take an early opportunity of vi&s;iting them, <HI>not to reproach them,</HI> but to evince, by the augmented urbanity and indulgent forgivene&s;s of her manners, how little &s;he merited their cen&s;ure: If the maligner was found among the &s;ons and daugh|ters of penury, &s;he never failed of be&s;towing upon them &s;ome extraordinary and liberal mark of the un|common elevation of her &s;pirit. Thus did her <HI>enemies become her warme&s;t panegyri&s;ts, and every malevolent princi|ple was ab&s;orbed in the &s;plendor of her almo&s;t peerle&s;s virtues.</HI></P>
<P>But while I am &s;olicitous to put you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the good opinion of that world, upon the great the|atre of which you are &s;o &s;oon to make your <HI>entr&eacute;e,</HI> I wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld not, however, wi&s;h you to purcha&s;e it at the expen&s;e of the integrity or &s;incerity of your character.

Be not ha&s;ty to make profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, nor credit tho&s;e feveri&s;h impre&s;&s;ions, which probably are, at be&s;t, but the paroxy&s;ms of an hour; but regard the <HI>deliberate and uniform e&s;teem of per&s;ons of e&s;tabli&s;hed vir|tue and reputation, as an incalculable trea&s;ure, and endeav|our to pre&s;erve their good opinion, by pur&s;uing tho&s;e attain|ments that, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, will infallibly be&s;tow upon you the perfumed wreath of &s;weet applau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Much hath been &s;aid re&s;pecting the virtue of &s;ecret-keeping, and the nece&s;&s;ity of electing a di&s;creet confi|dant; let me rather hope that you will have <HI>no &s;ecrets to keep.</HI> You will, I dare believe, be careful to obtain, and to perpetuate, that equity of thinking, and pro|priety of acting, which will paint your cheek with the hue of innocence, endow with mode&s;t confidence your words and actions, and in&s;ure a continuity of that charming &s;erenity and cheerful expectation, that at pre&s;ent triumphs in your bo&s;om. Yet, it is true, that there are a thou&s;and little delicacies, contingent alarms, hopes and fears, which alternately predominate in the female mind. The&s;e may create embarra&s;&s;ments, ob|&s;curing, po&s;&s;ibly, the better way, and enveloping in clouds tho&s;e enjoyments, that, under proper regula|tions, would unque&s;tionably be&s;tow the riche&s;t com|placency. Of all tho&s;e <HI>entanglements,</HI> and <HI>intricacies of every de&s;cription,</HI> the brea&s;t of a <HI>maternal</HI> friend is the only proper repo&s;itory. Years almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en|dow with experience; and <HI>affection, directed by knowl|edge, is demon&s;trably the &s;ure&s;t guide.</HI> A judicious moth|er, ri&s;ing &s;uperior to con&s;iderations, which generally influence a younger and <HI>le&s;s intere&s;ted confidant,</HI> will not cheri&s;h ill founded hopes, nor give energy to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions that are founded in weakne&s;s; <HI>but &s;he will do better; by her &s;y&s;tematic efforts, &s;he will annihilate the dif|ficulty,</HI> and again lead the foot&s;teps of the lovely trem|bler into the beamy paths of peace. A mother will neither indulge nor &s;oothe tho&s;e errors, which are pro|ductive of imbecility; her plan is, to cru&s;h in embryo every thing that may have a pernicious influence up|on the future progre&s;s of her child, <HI>to nerve by re&s;olution,</HI>

and to cultivate that fortitude &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in the ca|reer of life; and hence it is, that a mother &s;hould be con&s;idered as the only proper confidant of her daughter.</P>
<P>I will confe&s;s, my dear, that I am not only &s;atisfied, but perfectly charmed with your conduct. Your re&s;|olution to become exactly what I wi&s;h, has been inva|riably reduced to practice; and the &s;weet con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s, and tender ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of your apologies, have totally cancelled tho&s;e mi&s;takes, on which you have been precipitated by inexperience. Never, I ble&s;s God, have I di&s;covered in you a blameable impatience of reproof, nor cen&s;urable ha&s;te to procure your own ju&s;tification; all <HI>aggravating, &s;elf-applauding</HI> replies, <HI>implied accu&s;ations of rigour, audacious pertne&s;s and &s;elf-&s;ufficient loquacity, or di&s;contented gloomy re&s;erve, &s;ullen glances, angry and provoking ge&s;tures, with dumb indigna|tion</HI>&mdash;from all the&s;e you have &s;till been wholly exempt, and I have to acknowledge your mild &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;weet di&s;cretion, and affectionate duty, as the riche&s;t &s;olace, both to your father and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Such al&s;o is your conduct to our dome&s;tics, as to merit our highe&s;t approbation. The authority which I have thought proper to delegate to you, has been admirably &s;upported. Without a&s;&s;uming arrogance, or that imperious haughtine&s;s, &s;o vexatiou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to dependants, you have conducted with dignity, amelio|rated by conde&s;cen&s;ion; and this hath in&s;ured you both re&s;pect and e&s;teem. I am plea&s;ed with your <HI>man|ner</HI> of <HI>directing;</HI> and the habit you have &s;o happily ac|quired, of <HI>reque&s;ting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> of tho&s;e about you, is certainly preferable, both in <HI>form</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> to that peremptory commanding tone of voice, and imperious &s;tyle of language, &s;o generally adopted. Nothing can merit contempt, but unworthy actions; and you therefore rightly judge, that the individual, who, in the order of things, is employed in the lowe&s;t u&s;eful occupa|tion, provided he &s;ills his &s;phere with propriety, &s;hould not only be exempted from &s;corn and deri&s;ion, but <HI>is, in reality, &s;uperior to the crowned head,</HI> who&s;e life is a

combination of atrocious crimes. It is well ob&s;erved, that good &s;ervants &s;hould be regarded as humble friends. I am per&s;uaded it will ever be your aim to make their yoke ea&s;y; and I repeat, that in this hou&s;e, the mild benignity of your temper, and your engaging deportment, without in the &s;malle&s;t degree dimini&s;h|ing the con&s;ideration due to you, as the daughter of our election, has e&s;tabli&s;hed you in every heart. It has been your object to mitigate the unavoidable evils, and to le&s;&s;en the re&s;pective burdens of tho&s;e in|dividuals who compo&s;e our hou&s;ehold; and I ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure, that you have become the &s;overeign lady of their affections.</P>
<P>I am not apprehen&s;ive, that the rendering you the prai&s;e, &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably your due, will be, in any &s;ort, injurious. You will not, I flatter my&s;elf, be un|duly elated&mdash;far otherwi&s;e&mdash;the noble energies of your di&s;po&s;ition will be thus &s;timulated to yet higher excel|lence. Nothing is more di&s;gu&s;ting than an overween|ing &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and pre&s;umptuous pride, particu|larly in young per&s;ons; mode&s;t diffidence carries with it its own recommendation. I &s;hould blu&s;h to find my Margaretta; except induced by particular circum|&s;tances, making her&s;elf the heroine of her own narra|tions. Tho&s;e events which may be importantly inter|e&s;ting to you, and from which you conceive you derive an elevation of character, will, too probably, fatigue in the recital; the indifferent will con&s;ider them as in&s;ip|id; you will be &s;ubjected to ridicule, and a&s;&s;uredly draw upon your&s;elf the odium of <HI>egoti&s;m and imper|tinence.</HI></P>
<P>It is wi&s;dom to cultivate a complacency in the &s;cene under your pre&s;ent ob&s;ervation. <HI>Contentment is the riche&s;t gem within the gra&s;p of mortality;</HI> hardly any price can be too great for &s;o valuable an acqui&s;ition; it is a <HI>&s;ub&s;titute</HI> for almo&s;t every le&s;&s;er enjoyment, and often &s;upplies, with much re&s;pectability, the place of higher orders of felicity. <HI>You cannot call back the pa&s;t, you may never attain the future, and,</HI> &s;urely then, I may repeat, <HI>it is wi&s;dom to cultivate complacency in

<P>My minutes go no further, yet they may &s;erve to give an idea of tho&s;e &s;entiments, which were repeatedly and carefully inpre&s;&s;ed upon the mind of Margaretta; and I can &s;carcely imagine the reader will think their introduction in this place &s;tands in need of an apology.</P>

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible for any words of mine to &s;ay, with what unequalled plea&s;ure I read over and over again, tho&s;e letters which you have conde&s;cended to write to me. I have this morning been placing them according to their dates. I have be&s;towed upon them more ki&s;&s;es than there are lines; and, conjoining them with a piece of purple ribon, I can thus turn to them the more readily; the impre&s;&s;ion made by the folds will gradually di&s;appear, and, while I live, I &s;hall be able to pre&s;erve them. The la&s;t ten letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e letters do not appear.</NOTE>, contain|ing directions for my conduct, in all tho&s;e &s;ituations in which you &s;uppo&s;e I may po&s;&s;ibly be placed, I &s;hall certainly read, at lea&s;t once, every day.</P>
<P>Surely, never&mdash;no, never&mdash;was poor, rich orphan &s;o completely ble&s;&s;ed as your Margaretta. When you
<PB N="95" REF="034162_0441_0FFC6A4BB1431580">
went through Evelina ye&s;terday, I could &s;carcely for|bear interrupting you by an expre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e feel|ings of gratitude, which were all collected, if I may &s;o &s;ay, in one delightful emotion of exqui&s;ite and almo&s;t ungovernable joy! Evelina, it is true, did not find a mo|ther; but Mr. Villars was exactly &s;uch a man as my ten|derly indulgent father; and, methought, it was my own dear papa who was addre&s;&s;ing Lady Howard, when he &s;o affectionately &s;ays, <Q><HI>That child, Madam, &s;hall never, while life is lent, know the lo&s;s &s;he has &s;u&s;tained. I have cheri&s;hed, &s;uccoured and &s;upported her, from her earlie&s;t infancy to her &s;ixteenth year.</HI></Q> Good, kind gen|tleman&mdash;I was uncommonly affected. I have been looking over Evelina again this morning; and, on my knees, I pray God, that both you and my papa may be able to &s;ay of your Margaretta, as Mr. Villars of his Evelina, that &s;he has amply repaid your care and affection, and that &s;he is all which your fonde&s;t wi&s;hes had anticipated.</P>
<P>Evelina was very happy to meet in Lord Orville, a friend &s;o like her papa. Is it not very uncommon, mamma, for &s;o young a gentleman to be in the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e virtues which &s;eemed to have found a home in the bo&s;om of the venerable Mr. Villars?</P>
<P>But Evelina de&s;erved every thing&mdash;Was &s;he not, my mamma, a <HI>faultle&s;s character?</HI> Surely the Engli&s;h reviewers, of whom I have heard &s;o much, mu&s;t have &s;poken highly of tho&s;e volumes. I have again been weeping over the &s;ufferings of Lady Belmont&mdash;Sir John Belmont I al&s;o pity&mdash;May God protect me from the cruel impo&s;itions of ba&s;e and intere&s;ted men! I think, mamma, you did not give your opinion of Eve|lina. Your next letter, I hope, will teach me how I ought to think of it; and may I never take a &s;tep without your kind advice and direction, and may I always continue your affectionately dutiful,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR CHILD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>RARELY doth a day pa&s;s without furni&s;hing me with &s;ome new rea&s;on to love and admire my Marga|retta. You have experienced that I am not niggard of prai&s;e, nor is it proper I &s;hould be &s;o. I would as &s;oon withhold from you the light of heaven, le&s;t you &s;hould become enamoured with the beauty of your face, or the &s;ymmetry of your per&s;on, (neither of which you have been any how in&s;trumental in pro|curing) as I would keep back tho&s;e commendations decidedly due to unequivocal merit, in the fear they might be productive of &s;elf-conceit.</P>
<P>Prai&s;e operates upon the youthful mind like the vernal &s;hower upon the tender plant, or like the clear &s;hining of that parent orb, who&s;e genial ray &s;ucceeds the fertilizing irrigation. And I am, at this moment, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a motive &s;ufficient to extort applau&s;e even from the frigidity of apathy. Yes, my love, &s;ince you retired to your pen this morning, I have made a di&s;covery, that, while it <HI>elevates to a degree of rapture, the complacency I am in the habit of experiencing in my child,</HI> incalculably augments my confidence in her virtues.</P>
<P>You recollect when your papa fir&s;t informed you, that you &s;hould receive, at the clo&s;e of every week, a &s;mall &s;um, as pocket money, (which has &s;ince been regularly paid you) he at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ured you, it &s;hould remain entirely at your own di&s;po&s;al; that he would never require, or receive an account of its expenditure; and that, however you might think proper to enter it in your calculation of expen&s;es, it &s;hould, on no occa&s;ion, be &s;ubjected to his in&s;pection; and by this a&s;&s;urance he has ever &s;ince been religiou&s;ly bound. I will confe&s;s to you, my dear, that having never ob&s;erved even a ve&s;tige of this money, I have had a &s;trong curio&s;ity to know in what manner it was be&s;towed; but regarding the <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> of your father as <HI>rules</HI> for my conduct, I have forborne to inve&s;tigate;
<PB N="97" REF="034162_0443_0FFC6A456AA04AE0">
and, as the &s;um was &s;mall, I was the le&s;s anxious re|&s;pecting it. This morning, however, has produced a mo&s;t unexpected and captivating eclairci&s;&s;ement. In|duced, by its beauties, to prefer a walk to a book, I &s;trolled further than I have done &s;ince the illne&s;s under which I &s;o long laboured, and which filled the bo&s;om of my Margaretta with &s;uch tender apprehen&s;ions. It happened in my walk, that I pa&s;&s;ed the cottage of Me|lona, whom I have not &s;een for more than a year; and, indulging a hope, that time, aided by nece&s;&s;ity, might have procured that reformation, for which my coun|&s;els had been ineffectual, I felt a &s;trong inclination to look in upon the poor woman. I pa&s;&s;ed her humble thre&s;hold, marking, with plea&s;ure, an appearance of neatne&s;s, I had never before witne&s;&s;ed in the dwelling of Melona.</P>
<P>The cottage, you know, has two apartments; no per&s;on was in that which I entered; but it bore &s;trong te&s;timony of the cleanline&s;s and indu&s;try of its mi&s;tre&s;s; and, moreover, the buz of a &s;pinning-wheel &s;aluted my ear! This is excellent, thought I, and ju&s;t as I was about to enter the other room, little Peggy open|ed the door, and carefully &s;hutting it after her, tripped into the &s;treet. The child had her eyes &s;o &s;teadily fix|ed upon the &s;pelling-book, which &s;he held open in her hand, that &s;he did not ob&s;erve me; and the grateful noi&s;e of the &s;pinning-wheel &s;till continued. Peggy's apparel was &s;trikingly de&s;criptive of <HI>&s;canty means, dili|gently employed to the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible advantage;</HI> and this cir|cum&s;tance, together with the new face which every thing in the cottage of Melona a&s;&s;umed, determined me to interrogate the child, expecting, from her inno|cence and &s;implicity, a clue of direction for my ap|proaches to her mother. I &s;oon overtook her, and in|terrupted her &s;tudies with a&mdash;How are you, my pretty little Peggy? She had no recollection of me, and not having reflection enough to teach her to wonder at my knowledge of her name, with a childi&s;h kind of ba&s;h|fulne&s;s, &s;he dropped a courte&s;y, and &s;aid, "Pretty well I thank you, Madam." Where are you going, Peggy?
<PB N="98" REF="034162_0444_0FFC6A43E197FDA8">
"I goes every day to &s;chool, Ma'am, now-a-days." And what do you read in, pray? "I reads in this here &s;pelling-book; and I &s;tudies my le&s;&s;on every morning." That is very proper, my dear; you &s;eem to have a very hand&s;ome &s;pelling-book, quite new; I hope you take care of it: Who gave it to you, Peggy? "That I mu&s;t not tell, Madam; for Mi&s;s Melworth would be angry if I &s;hould." Mi&s;s Melworth! &s;aid I, almo&s;t ga&s;ping for breath; why, child, what has Mi&s;s Melworth to do with it? "I mu&s;t not &s;ay, Madam, for Mi&s;s Margaretta her&s;elf bid me not to &s;peak; but for all that, my mamma &s;ays how that &s;he is an angel, and that &s;he has &s;aved us all, and made her a thou&s;and times <HI>gooder</HI> than &s;he was before; but this is all a &s;e|cret, and I would not tell for the world."</P>
<P>Here I will own to you, my love, that your <HI>per|&s;evering</HI> &s;uperiority originated in my bo&s;om, admira|tion of my daughter, and accu&s;ation of my&s;elf. But determining to trace every &s;tep, by which you had ef|fectuated &s;o valuable a change, I took Peggy by the hand, and once more entered the cottage of Melona. "<HI>The wicket opening with a latch,</HI>" gave us a ready ad|mittance into its back apartment. Melona threw her eyes over a countenance &s;he had &s;o long known; a crim&s;on blu&s;h in&s;tantly &s;uffu&s;ed her cheek, and was as in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded by a death-like palene&s;s; her wheel &s;topped, and, &s;inking upon a chair, it was with difficulty that the immediate application of my &s;alts pre&s;erved her from fainting.</P>
<P>When &s;he was a little compo&s;ed I began my attack, and managing with &s;ome addre&s;s, I &s;oon obtained the full confe&s;&s;ion of a &s;ecret, which adds another beauti|ful trait to the character of my Margaretta. She in|formed me of your appearance under her humble roof upon the week you fir&s;t received your little &s;ti|pend&mdash;of your &s;age admonitions&mdash;of your earne&s;t en|treaties that &s;he would permit you to put her little Peggy to &s;chool&mdash;of your propo&s;al to purcha&s;e the &s;pinning-wheel&mdash;of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he had received from you during her illne&s;s, and that of her hu&s;band&mdash;and

of the happy change a patronage &s;o unexpected had produced in her life. Reflecting, &s;he &s;aid, upon the great goodne&s;s of &s;o young a lady, upon her &s;tooping to take &s;uch a compa&s;&s;ionate intere&s;t in her affairs, and conde&s;cending to urge her, with &s;uch extraordinary earne&s;tne&s;s, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her&s;elf to have pity on her hu&s;band, to have pity on her poor little Peggy, and to make the be&s;t of that little which was allowed her, filled h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r with grief, joy and a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;grief, at her own unworthine&s;s and great wickedne&s;s&mdash;and joy and a&s;toni&s;hment, that a <HI>little angel had come down from Heaven, to dwell among the &s;inners of mankind</HI>&mdash;(I give you her own words.) She immediately made a vow, that nothing &s;tronger than water &s;hould, in future, pa&s;s her lips; and, that &s;he might have no temptation to forfeit a re&s;olution &s;o &s;alutary, &s;he forthwith com|mitted <HI>the intoxicating di&s;tillation, hitherto carefully con|cealed for her own particular u&s;e,</HI> to the &s;tream which winds its way at a little di&s;tance from the cottage; and, being earne&s;tly bent upon a thorough reform, her application became as remarkable as her previous negligence had been; and habit reconciling her to her new walk, frugality, neatne&s;s and indu&s;try, with all their captivating charms, &s;oon bur&s;t upon her.</P>
<P>Melona informs me, that &s;he long refu&s;ed to receive any part of your weekly &s;tipend; but that, on your po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance, that the kindne&s;s of your parents had left you no wi&s;h ungratified; that you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an undoubted right to di&s;po&s;e of this &s;um exactly accord|ing to your own plea&s;ure; and, that her acceptance was the only compen&s;ation &s;he could make to you for the intere&s;t you &s;o kindly took in her welfare, &s;he had at length con&s;ented to receive from you weekly dona|tions; that you had furni&s;hed her hu&s;band with many articles nece&s;&s;ary to his bu&s;ine&s;s; and that you par|ticularly paid for the in&s;truction of Peggy. But &s;he added, that &s;he believed, &s;he and her little family were not your only pen&s;ioners! Matchle&s;s child!

<P>Do you not think I came home in raptures with tho&s;e peerle&s;s virtues which I have the honour to cher|i&s;h and to protect? I could hardly, upon this occa&s;ion, arrogate to my&s;elf the title of your Mother, and I felt my mind &s;pontaneou&s;ly pro&s;trating before an intel|lect, who&s;e brilliant dawn &s;urpa&s;&s;es the meridian ef|fulgence of common intelligence.</P>
<P>Plato met me with your letter. I was prepared to accede to any reque&s;t of yours&mdash;and, as your father does not return until the evening, I re&s;erve, till that period, the plea&s;ure of a circum&s;tantial account of Me|lona and her cottage; of the means by which I ob|tained the delightful particulars which I &s;hall narrate; and of be&s;towing upon the brow of merit, the wreath of unequivocal applau&s;e. Shall we not, my dear, en|joy a mo&s;t enchanting evening? Well, but you &s;olicit my &s;entiments of Evelina. Surely, my Margaretta is an enthu&s;ia&s;t in her gratitude&mdash;<HI>but the enthu&s;ia&s;m of virtue is a noble enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>The plot of Evelina is well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and happily executed. It is a novel to which we can return with plea&s;ure, even to a &s;econd or third peru&s;al, and this is more than can be &s;aid of common productions of this kind. The &s;tyle is familiar and ea&s;y; and the ideas &s;eem naturally to grow out of each other.</P>
<P>Evelina is &s;aid to be a fir&s;t production, and, if &s;o, it is entitled, or the abilities of its author, to high admi|ration. But I think you will e&s;teem Cecilia (which is a publication of the &s;ame author) as a work which merits a <HI>decided preference.</HI> The character of Albany, in Cecilia, is a highly fini&s;hed original, and has for me peculiar charms. <HI>I do not &s;ay it is natural;</HI> but I could wi&s;h to render &s;uch characters <HI>official,</HI> and to <HI>multiply them in &s;ociety.</HI> Mi&s;s Burney's publications have hith|erto

done honour both to her fine genius and benevo|lent heart; and, I think, they have much appropriate excellence. I am ignorant in what cla&s;s the reviewers have placed the productions of Mi&s;s Burney; but ju&s;|tice mu&s;t award them a very high rank in the literary line. Yet, it appears to me, that Evelina, as a com|po&s;ition, is not without a blemi&s;h; and, I conceive, the heroine her&s;elf <HI>is &s;trikingly deficient</HI> in one particu|lar, which con&s;titutes a capital requi&s;ite in the compo|&s;ition of a <HI>young and amiable woman.</HI> The ta&s;k of a cen&s;urer mu&s;t always appear invidious; yet, for the &s;ake of my Margaretta, who warmly demands, "<HI>Was not Evelina a faultle&s;s character?</HI>" I expre&s;s my &s;enti|ments without re&s;erve. Evelina then, was <HI>greatly want|ing in that delicacy,</HI> which &s;hould have marked her de|portment to Madame Duval. Madame Duval had been <HI>denied the aids of education; this was her misfortune, rather than her fault; and a well informed, amiable de|&s;cendant &s;hould have thrown over this defect the veil of du|ty,</HI> and not have &s;ought every opportunity to have <HI>expo&s;ed it in the mo&s;t glaring colours!</HI> In the letters ad|dre&s;&s;ed to her <HI>reverend corre&s;pondent,</HI> the old lady is rarely mentioned without a &s;ketch of her bad Engli&s;h, as, <HI>"Ay now," cried Madame Duval, "that's another of the unpolitene&s;&s;es of you Engli&s;h, to go to talking of &s;uch things as that: Now, in Paris, nobody never &s;ays nothing about religion, no more than about politics.</HI>" And again, "<HI>I would have you learn to be more politer, Sir,</HI>" &amp;c. &amp;c. Was it, I a&s;k, the part of a <HI>well di&s;po&s;ed, well educated young lady,</HI> to hold up to view errors of this kind, when found in the mouth of a per&s;on, <HI>who&s;e years,</HI> and <HI>who&s;e affinity,</HI> entitled her to a more <HI>candid</HI> and <HI>dutiful</HI> repre&s;entation?</P>
<P>It appears that Madame Duval was indebted to na|ture for nothing but the charms of her per&s;on, and that her temper was very unhappy and cruelly implacable; yet it is not in&s;inuated, that <HI>her enormities were greatly multiplied.</HI> She is, however, treated as the mo&s;t atro|cious of criminals; and, by the in&s;tigations of a Cap|tain Mirvin and the <HI>lover of her grand-daughter,</HI> &s;he re|ceives
<PB N="102" REF="034162_0448_0FFC6D79A70837D0">
the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and cruel outrage. The <HI>gentle</HI> Evelina, <HI>who is apprized that &s;ome mi&s;chievous plot is in agitation again&s;t her grandmother, &s;ets out without a &s;ingle remon&s;trance,</HI> attended only by the &s;ervants, to accom|pany her to a ju&s;tice of peace, <HI>although &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed previous fears of entru&s;ting her&s;elf to her care!</HI> A farce, of which I cannot &s;ee the <HI>wit,</HI> &s;ucceeds. <HI>The poor old lady is made to believe her&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;avage banditti&mdash;her apprehen&s;ions for her life are apparently well founded&mdash;&s;he is torn from the carriage by ma&s;ked men&mdash;&s;he is dragged along the road, cruelly agitated, &s;hook, and thumped about&mdash;&s;tuck fa&s;t in a ditch&mdash;her legs bound&mdash;tied to a tree&mdash;and, robbed of her head dre&s;s, &s;he is thus left to her own contemplations, while her grand-daughter continues in her chariot, li&s;tening to a tale of love!!</HI></P>
<P>In one &s;en&s;e, Evelina mu&s;t be con&s;idered as <HI>acce&s;&s;ary to the&s;e unwarrantable proceedings; a &s;ingle hint would have &s;aved her parent all the cruel mortifications to which &s;he was &s;ubjected; but this hint &s;he withheld!</HI> If conduct &s;o reprehen&s;ible is <HI>too gro&s;s, even for a romping mi&s;s, in pur&s;uit of fun,</HI> how mu&s;t it detract from the character of a pupil of the venerable Villars? <HI>Surely, Evelina &s;hould not have been a&s;toni&s;hed, (con&s;idering the propen&s;ities of Madame Duval) at the &s;lap which &s;he received in her face&mdash;and the unre&s;trained violence of the old lady's di&s;po&s;i|tion, is, upon this occa&s;ion, rather too conciliatory. An air of ridicule</HI> is thrown over this doleful narrative by Evelina, who, giving it in the manner of the poor &s;uf|ferer, inter&s;per&s;es it with &s;uch &s;entences as this&mdash;"<HI>I am &s;ure, I dare &s;ay, I am out of joint all over, &amp;c.</HI>" Evelina is a <HI>&s;ilent ob&s;erver of the mirth of the &s;ervants, and confe&s;|&s;es that &s;he was, her&s;elf, almo&s;t compelled to laugh at the pity-moving recital!!</HI> For a conduct &s;o unequal to every other in&s;tance of her blamele&s;s life, there can be but one rea&s;on, the fear of offending a <HI>&s;ea-mon&s;ter,</HI> on whom &s;he in no &s;ort depended, and from whom &s;he could, in any moment, e&s;cape to that &s;anctuary, which had, for &s;o many years, continued the a&s;ylum of her innocence. But, if the fear of giving offence is an apology for Evelina, can it be con&s;idered as &s;uch
<PB N="103" REF="034162_0449_0FFC6D7822CEB0B8">
for the venerable Villars, to whom every circum&s;tance is related, and <HI>from whom &s;he receives not the &s;malle&s;t re|proof?</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible to inculcate upon the mind of young people too high a re&s;pect for years; age is ever entitled to veneration, and we &s;hould regard the feel|ings of per&s;ons in advanced life with the utmo&s;t de|ference. It is true, that Madame Duval had been im|placable to the mother of Evelina; but it does not ap|pear, that the young lady had embraced a vindictive plan; and it is al&s;o true, that the mother of Evelina had <HI>imprudently confided in a libertine!</HI> Nor can we oth|erwi&s;e account for this ra&s;hne&s;s, con&s;idering that &s;he too had pa&s;&s;ed eighteen years of her life with the re|&s;pectable Villars, than by &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he inherited a portion of the imbecility &s;o &s;trongly marked in the conduct of her parents. The agonies of Madame Du|val, on the death of lady Belmont, &s;hould, to erring mortals, have palliated her offence; and it ought al|ways to have been remembered, whatever were her faults, or foibles, that &s;he was &s;till the grand-parent of Evelina.</P>
<P>At a tran&s;action &s;o enormous as the unprovoked attack upon Madame Duval, we conceive additional di&s;gu&s;t, from the con&s;ideration that it was perpetrated by per&s;ons taking rank in a circle, which, we are in|duced to &s;uppo&s;e, was the &s;eat of elegance. But, for the honour of human nature, I tru&s;t, no one of its fraternity ever &s;at for the picture of a Captain Mirvin. I know not what the Briti&s;h &s;ailors may be, but I have had an opportunity of making many ob&s;ervations upon various characters among that cla&s;s of people in this country, and I have never yet met with a re&s;emblance to this extravagant caricature! Do but recur to his capital enormities, plotting &s;o unwarrantably again&s;t a female, who was countenanced as a vi&s;itor to the re&s;pectable Lady Howard; and, in the clo&s;e of the third volume, throwing the whole company, con&s;i&s;ting of genteel, well bred per&s;ons, into con&s;ternation, alarm|ing the ladies, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing every individual! Are you not ready to a&s;k, could exploits of this nature have
<PB N="104" REF="034162_0450_0FFC6D7654083838">
been &s;ubmitted to in any civilized country under heaven? The general terror excited upon that &s;ingular occa&s;ion, (it is unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that I refer to the introduction of the monkey) with the blood &s;tream|ing from the ear of poor Lovel, would have drawn upon the malevolent plotter of the outrage, the vindictive re&s;entment and con&s;equent cha&s;ti&s;ement of a horde of &s;avages.</P>
<P>Yet this invader of the rights of ho&s;pitality and betrayer of the peace of &s;ociety, is fir&s;t announced to the reader, by the penetrating, refined and &s;entimental Lady Howard, <HI>as the man of her daughter's heart, and as a per&s;onage, who&s;e unexpected</HI> return had given birth to joyful &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>It is difficult to conceive how a lady of Mrs. Mir|vin's refined &s;en&s;ibility, could ever unite her&s;elf to &s;uch a man&punc; but, having thus done, <HI>the propriety of her &s;ub&s;equent conduct will not admit a doubt.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay I am plea&s;ed with tho&s;e de&s;criptions, which attribute to humanity a greater degree of de|formity than con&s;i&s;ts with experience. It is a &s;ufficient apology for the <HI>exaggerated delineation of an exalted character, that it may have its u&s;e.</HI> It frequently <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> a <HI>&s;pirit of emulation;</HI> and, although we may not reach the goal of perfection, yet every advance we make thereto, is a very valuable point gained, and certainly an ample compen&s;ation for our mo&s;t arduous efforts. But vice and folly are <HI>&s;ufficiently odious,</HI> when exhibited in their own native colours; <HI>and, while I can &s;ee no benefit in heightening the imbecility and atrocious de|pravity of the &s;pecies, I am fearful that the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, when called to the ob&s;ervation of hues &s;till blacker than the turpitude of his own enormities have ever yet a&s;&s;umed, may thence conclude his offences comparatively venial.</HI></P>
<P>The trivial &s;cenes inter&s;per&s;ed through the pages of Evelina and Cecilia, are, it is &s;aid, too frequent and too prolix; but I am not convinced of the ju&s;tice of this remark; and I have to &s;ay, that whatever may be the defects (and no human performance is without its blemi&s;h) of tho&s;e ine&s;timable productions, their beau|ties
<PB N="105" REF="034162_0451_0FFC6D74C7A1A4D0">
are of <HI>the fir&s;t order.</HI> And I repeat, that their right to rank with compo&s;itions of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, in their line, is indi&s;putable.</P>
<P>The character of Lord Orville is indeed highly fin|i&s;hed; it is enriched with every virtue of which our nature, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of degradation, is &s;u&s;cepti|ble. Nor do I find it difficult to conceive of a &s;en&s;i|ble, di&s;creet young man, who&s;e mind has been early occupied by &s;entiments of propriety, acting, upon ev|ery occa&s;ion, preci&s;ely as did Lord Orville. The ven|erable Villars may al&s;o be regarded at nearly faultle&s;s. The mo&s;t beautiful pa&s;&s;ages in Evelina are to be found in his letters. How tenderly affecting is his addre&s;s to Lady Howard, by his Evelina! It can hardly be read too often.</P>
<P>Do you not think, my Margaretta, <HI>that I too, make my applications?</HI> But every heart mu&s;t be intere&s;ted in &s;uch a character; and after having, in idea, followed with him his orphan child to the ordeal over which &s;he victoriou&s;ly triumphed, we li&s;ten, with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure, to his concluding addre&s;s.</P>
<P>I adopt the language of this venerable man as a pe|riod to this letter. <Q><HI>The&s;e wounds, which the former &s;everity of fortune hath inflicted, are healed by the ulti|mate con&s;olation of pouring forth my dying words in ble&s;|&s;ings on my child!

<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not blame your tears, my dear; the lo&s;s of your young friend is a &s;erious calamity, and it is natural to weep over our misfortunes. Horatio was a promi&s;ing youth; his demi&s;e has overwhelmed with di&s;tre&s;s a worthy family, and the well grounded hopes of tender and judicious parents are thus laid in the du&s;t. But, my dear Margaretta, while I allow you to regret the removal of Horatio, I cannot ju&s;tify your impa&s;&s;ioned exclamation&mdash;"To what purpo&s;e was he &s;o good, &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o learned, and &s;o every way accompli&s;hed?" Does not my daughter know that virtue, tran&s;planted to a cele&s;tial &s;oil, will flouri&s;h with immortal beauty? The faculties, while embodied in this clay-built tenement, are <HI>literally</HI> muffled by the den&s;e and heavy materials, in which they are envel|oped. The mind is only in its dawn of being; but the valuable acquirements which it attains while here, are not, upon its emancipation, lo&s;t; far otherwi&s;e&mdash;they are rather introductory to that career, which is to be continued and perfected in future worlds.</P>
<P>The &s;tudent of hi&s;tory becomes acquainted with all tho&s;e characters that have borne con&s;picuous parts upon the va&s;t theatre of this globe. The philo&s;opher, devoted to the &s;tudy of nature, attaining tho&s;e bli&s;sful regions, &s;hall pur&s;ue, with abundant advantage, his delightful employ. The a&s;tronomer will behold, with a&s;toni&s;hment, where other &s;y&s;tems ri&s;e! Suns, which
<PB N="107" REF="034162_0453_0FFA655EEA8ACAF8">
have not even theoretically darted a &s;ingle ray on his inquiring mind, will then bur&s;t in re&s;plendent lu&s;tre to his enraptured gaze. The laws of attraction, of gravitation, the centrifugal and centripetal force of bodies; the&s;e will be fully under&s;tood. <HI>Cau&s;es,</HI> as well as <HI>effects,</HI> will &s;tand confe&s;t; and knowledge, combining complacency, will accumulate in &s;ublime progre&s;&s;ion. Every laudable inve&s;tigation, which may be ranked un|der the head, of intellectual contemplations, will prob|ably be re&s;umed with augmenting energy, while the virtues, attaining their native &s;kies, will flouri&s;h with immortal beauty.</P>
<P>Thus the young Horatio may be con&s;idered as an amiable novitiate, who obtaining, while here, the ru|diments of &s;cience, is now removed to a &s;uperior &s;em|inary, where every acquirement worth pre&s;erving will receive the highe&s;t fini&s;hing of which it is &s;u&s;cep|tible. This reflection is a &s;ource of infinite con|&s;olation, and often have I experienced its &s;oothing ef|ficacy. I was once tenderly attached to a youth, beau|tiful, virtuous and informed as Horatio. His under|&s;tanding unfolded with uncommon brilliancy; an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for knowledge gave him to pur&s;ue, with eagerne&s;s, tho&s;e branches of literature which were propo&s;ed to his con&s;ideration, and he acquired in his little &s;pan, a va&s;t &s;tock of erudition, for which, alas! he had no u&s;e in time! From this youth I received even filial attention; but he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut off in the bloom of life, and melancholy hours were written for me.</P>
<P>On my b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nded knees, with every ri&s;ing day, I offer up my ori&s;ons of devout thankfulne&s;s to that God, who hath given my Margaretta to fill up the void in my bo&s;om, which the demi&s;e of a youth &s;o beloved had left therein; and I will, ere long, put into your hands a collection of my letters in manu&s;cript, addre&s;&s;|ed to this &s;on of my affection, while he was a &s;tudent at the academy of&mdash;, including a conci&s;e view of per&s;ons and events; and, in the mean time, as you have already made con&s;iderable proficiency in the &s;tudy of biography and hi&s;tory, I reque&s;t you, as an
<PB N="108" REF="034162_0454_0FFA655D357447C8">
exerci&s;e from which will re&s;ult obvious advantages, to an&s;wer me unre&s;ervedly, according to the dictates of your deliberate judgment, to the following que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, To which of the heroes, who&s;e actions are re|corded by Plutarch, you give the preference?</P>
<P>Secondly, Whom you e&s;teem mo&s;t of all the mon|archs who have &s;wayed the Briti&s;h &s;ceptre, from the year eight hundred and twenty-&s;even, which united the kingdoms of the heptarchy, under Egbert, when he was &s;olemnly crowned king of England, unto the acce&s;&s;ion of George III. to that throne?</P>
<P>Thirdly, What were your &s;en&s;ations as you read, and what are your &s;entiments of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, Henry IV. of France, Charles I. of En|gland, and Peter the Great, Czar of Ru&s;&s;ia?</P>
<P>And, fourthly and la&s;tly, although I do not enjoin you to weigh with accuracy the <HI>murders of a Cortez,</HI> although I expect you will pa&s;s rapidly over the pages in which a Montezuma bled, and in which are regi&s;|tered the ma&s;&s;acre of an innocent and defencele&s;s people; yet, my dear, I am &s;olicitous to know whom you characterize as the mo&s;t amiable of all tho&s;e ad|venturers, who, quitting the chalky cliffs of your native land, cro&s;&s;ed the broad Atlantic, to obtain e&s;tabli&s;h|ments in North-America?</P>
<P>It is by the careful inve&s;tigation of proper, great and virtuous actions, as performed by others, that the glow of emulation is enkindled in our bo&s;oms. We gaze at each tran&s;cendent excellence, until our minds acquire n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w energy; they are nerved by fortitude, and we are rendered equal, as far as opportunity calls us forth, to the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent and uniform exertions.</P>

<HEAD>To my honoured MOTHER.</HEAD>
<P>THANK you, my mamma, for permitting me to weep for Horatio; you are in all things indulgent; and I cannot but blu&s;h for an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;orrow, which is, indeed, unbecoming in a young creature, who has been privileged by receiving your in&s;tructions, and ob&s;erv|ing your example. I will no more <HI>regret the virtues of Horatio;</HI> but I will endeavour to obtain tho&s;e ac|quirements which &s;hall render me a fit companion for him in that world whither he hath flown.</P>
<P>You, my mamma, have often been afflicted, and yet you are cheerful and happy! It will be my pride to tread in your &s;teps, and for two very good rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, I &s;hall thus become amiable and virtuous; and, &s;econdly, I &s;hall give joy to your maternal bo&s;om. To be called your daughter, and to merit, in any de|gree, that di&s;tinction, is my highe&s;t ambition; and while I am thought worthy to &s;ucceed the beloved child whom you mourn, I &s;hall indeed be the happy Margaretta. The letters which you are to give me, are a new in&s;tance of your goodne&s;s; my trea&s;ures are daily augmenting, and my gratitude ought to be proportioned.</P>
<P>I have again carefully looked over the volumes of biography and hi&s;tory, which I have &s;o lately read in

your pre&s;ence; and, although they are all fre&s;h in my memory, yet I can hardly tell how to give an opin|ion re&s;pecting them, and, but in obedience to the wi&s;hes of my Mother, I &s;hould not pre&s;ume to expre&s;s my &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Plutarch has recorded &s;o many great actions, that I am almo&s;t lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment while I read his pages; but, after he&s;itating who, of all his heroes, to name upon this occa&s;ion, I have thought that as Ari&s;tides &s;o generally obtained the appellation <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> he mu&s;t have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uperior excellence; and, upon attentive|ly examining his deeds of worth, I cannot &s;ay that he did not de&s;erve the title which he received. I am ready to a&s;k, Was not Ari&s;tides a perfect character? and, &s;ince you have put me upon the compari&s;on, I have taken the liberty to conceive, that there are not many of the Engli&s;h kings worthy to be compared with him.</P>
<P>If Edward VI. had lived, as he was &s;o early re|markable for virtue and for learning, he might have exceeded all who went before; and I &s;hould not then have he&s;itated in my an&s;wer to the &s;econd que&s;tion of my dear mamma. The reply of the &s;on of Henry VI. upon being interrogated by the prince whom he deem|ed a u&s;urper, relative to his appearance in England, betokened an intrepid mind: But this youth was bar|barou&s;ly murdered. Henry VII. was a good king; he is &s;aid to have rendered his &s;ubjects powerful and happy, and to have wrought a great change in the manners of the people. Henry V. is a celebrated and victorious warrior. The Black Prince is rendered il|lu&s;trious by many virtues. Gold&s;mith tells us, that he left behind him a character <HI>without a &s;ingle blemi&s;h</HI>&mdash;that time could &s;carcely alleviate the &s;orrows occa&s;ion|ed by his death&mdash;that his affability, clemency, and lib|eral di&s;po&s;ition, is extolled by many hi&s;torians; and that, although he was born in an age in which milita|ry virtues alone were held in e&s;teem, he cultivated the arts of peace, and &s;eemed ever more happy in <HI>de&s;erving prai&s;e, than in obtaining it</HI>&mdash;<HI>But he was not a monarch.</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="034162_0457_0FFC6D6884158070">
Thom&s;on's Edward and Eleonara, has prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my mind in favour of that monarch. Shall I, my mamma, greatly err, if I give the preference to the hero of the poet? Suffer me to point out a few in|&s;tances wherein I have been charmed with the charac|ter of that &s;overeign.</P>
<P>At an early period, when Prince of Wales, he ap|pears fighting the battles of his father, who&s;e rebellious &s;ubjects had taken arms again&s;t him. Fired by the in&s;ults offered to his royal parents, he pur&s;ues and takes vengeance upon them; he &s;ubmits, with calm re&s;ignation, to the hard&s;hips impo&s;ed upon him, and becomes a voluntary ho&s;tage for his father: he extri|cates him&s;elf with great dexterity from the difficulties in which he was involved; he e&s;capes from the am|bitious Leice&s;ter, and &s;uddenly appearing the brave leader of his armies, his pre&s;ence in&s;ures &s;ucce&s;s; he ha&s;tes, with filial eagerne&s;s, to &s;natch his father from the threatened danger; he overcomes, in &s;ingle com|bat, the rebel Gordon, a veteran trained to arms, and &s;killed in combat! He does more; for, <HI>good</HI> as he is brave, he obtains his pardon, rein&s;tates him in the king's favour, and re&s;tores him to his family and e&s;tates! He mourned for his father with true filial &s;orrow. When he came to the throne, <HI>he might have been de&s;potic; but he contented him&s;elf with limited power.</HI> In the mid&s;t of danger he di&s;covered great intrepidity; no circum&s;tance could dimini&s;h his valour; he was never vindictive but when he conceived the exigencies of the State required it. We are informed, that he added much to the real emolument of his &s;ubjects; <HI>that he was &s;olicitous for the tranquillity of the people,</HI> and was &s;eldom arbitrary but with a view to their intere&s;t. He was devout, fond of ju&s;tice, e&s;&s;ayed to di&s;tribute it indi&s;criminately, and <HI>confirmed the rights of the people.</HI> Such is the character of Edward I. and yet, methinks, many of his actions were deeply tinged with &s;everity.</P>
<P>To read the life of the Queen of Scots without tears, appears to me impo&s;&s;ible. I prefer <HI>Doctor Stuart</HI> to <HI>Doctor Robin&s;on,</HI> and I view Mary as the mo&s;t injured

of women. I cannot regard her as a murderer&mdash;I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed if &s;he is accu&s;ed&mdash;I am fond of con&s;idering her as blamele&s;s. <HI>I do not love Elizabeth</HI>&mdash;I am a&s;ton|i&s;hed to find her at any time the object of admiration; and I feel di&s;appointed, that no remarkable calamity overtook her as a puni&s;hment for her cruelty to a woman &s;o unfortunate and &s;o meritorious! The Earl of Murray I dete&s;t, nor did I part with a &s;ingle tear at his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>Henry IV. of France (excu&s;e the arrogance of your girl) was, I conceive, <HI>inferior</HI> to the Duke of Sully. I have been ready to think he owed his greatne&s;s, in many in&s;tances, to his mini&s;ter; he is often extricated by him from his difficulties, and &s;aved from the mo&s;t di&s;honourable connexions; yet the king is frequently angry with the duke without a cau&s;e. Be&s;ides, <HI>the king was an apo&s;tate;</HI> and the duke of Sully, although im|portuned by his &s;overeign, who enforced his arguments by the mo&s;t &s;plendid offers, pre&s;erved his religion inviolate. The duke is tenderly attached to his family, while the king very &s;oon enters into habits of intimacy with per&s;ons who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have procured the death of his mother! nor does he pay much attention to the feelings of his &s;i&s;ter! And indeed I am ready to a&s;k, Was not the duke of Sully, as well as Ari&s;tides, with|out a fault? The action of Ravaillac was horrid, and, methought, I felt the wound which pierced the &s;ide of the king.</P>
<P>The fate of king Charles has co&s;t me unnumbered &s;ighs and tears. Surely, had the advances which he conde&s;cended to make, been accepted, he would have become the father of his people. The heroi&s;m of Lady Fairfax, at the trial of the unfortunate monarch, excites my gratitude and my admiration. When the royal &s;ufferer takes leave of his children, and when, for the la&s;t time, he pre&s;&s;es his in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ant &s;on to his bo&s;om, I can &s;carce control the angui&s;h of my &s;pirit; a &s;ick|ne&s;s comes over my heart, and I feel as if I were about to part with the deare&s;t of my friends. I follow Charles to the &s;caffold&mdash;I attend to the good bi&s;hop&mdash;
<PB N="113" REF="034162_0459_0FFC6D6268E2C818">
I behold the venerable &s;ufferer&mdash;I li&s;ten to his em|phatic "REMEMBER"&mdash;I &s;ee his head extended on the block, his hands out-&s;tretched! and I &s;hudder at the fatal blow!&mdash;I turn from the bleeding trophy of rebellion!&mdash;I execrate the enemies of the martyred monarch!&mdash;I join in the lamentations of the deeply affected &s;pectators; and, I think, I would not be Eliza|beth of England, nor Oliver Cromwell, although I might thus be rai&s;ed to the empire of the whole world.</P>
<P>I take plea&s;ure in travelling with the Czar Peter; I admire him while in Holland and England. He was called great&mdash;but I had rather he had been le&s;s rigorous to his &s;on.</P>
<P>You have taught me, Madam, to venerate the char|acters of tho&s;e matchle&s;s men, who, quitting their native country, and tho&s;e commodious habitations where they enjoyed the elegancies of life, cro&s;&s;ed the wide Atlantic, and took up their re&s;idence in a wil|derne&s;s, where even the articles nece&s;&s;ary to their exi&s;tence were with difficulty obtained; thus encoun|tering various hard&s;hips, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of ob|taining liberty to wor&s;hip God agreeably to the dictates of their con&s;ciences; and I attend, with &s;uperior &s;atisfaction, to the actions of per&s;ons, who were thus di&s;tingui&s;hed for patience, fortitude and piety.</P>
<P>But, when I am required to &s;ay which I admire mo&s;t, I again feel as when making a choice among Plutarch's Greeks and Romans; and I am ready to conceive, that the naming one would render me guilty of di&s;re&s;pect to the re&s;t; yet my mother would not put a que&s;tion to her girl unbecoming for her to an&s;wer, and I cannot but feel a plea&s;ure in accommo|dating my&s;elf to her reque&s;ts. Mr. John&s;on, of Clip&s;|ham, &s;eems to have exerci&s;ed him&s;elf in acts of kind|ne&s;s towards America; he was an upright and pious man; after his death, the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts evinced the e&s;timation in which they held him, by <HI>directing their bodies, as they departed out of time, to be interred around him.</HI> But the peru&s;al of the life of

Govenor Winthrop has given me inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atis|faction; he was early di&s;tingui&s;hed in Suffolk, and his being appointed a ju&s;tice of peace at the age of eighteen, is a &s;triking proof that he was &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;upe|rior virtue. He enjoyed an e&s;tate of many hundreds a year; but he he&s;itated not in parting with every thing which was eligible in his pro&s;pects, when they were &s;et in competition with his integrity and his religion. Placed, by general con&s;ent, at the head of the new formed colony, he was eleven times cho&s;en its gov|ernor, and it appears that he conducted with prudence and ju&s;tice. The death of Governor Winthrop, who was &s;tyled, the Father of the infant State, cau&s;ed a general lamentation throughout the colony; and his virtues, it is &s;aid, were many, while his errors were few&mdash;perhaps he had no &s;uperior.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear mamma, have I endeavoured to obey you. <HI>Often attending to conver&s;ations pa&s;&s;ing between my papa and you, on intere&s;ting points in hi&s;tory, I have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with the greater confidence.</HI> I know you will have the goodne&s;s to point out my mi&s;takes, and tell me how I ought to think of per&s;ons and things, and I reque&s;t you to write me a &s;eparate letter upon each of the &s;ubjects you have propo&s;ed, and thus add to the number of tho&s;e plea&s;ing obligations, which you have long been in the habit of conferring upon your ever duteous and affectionate</P>

<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have, my love, fully an&s;wered my expecta|tions, and I <HI>pronounce deci&s;ively,</HI> (a liberty which you know I &s;eldom allow my&s;elf to take) that few young women have made better improvement of their time and advantages than my Margaretta; and, as I am in the habit of gratifying all your rea&s;onable wi&s;h|es, I &s;hall, according to your de&s;ire, addre&s;s you in &s;eparate letters upon the principal points to which I have required your attention.</P>
<P>I did not calculate on preci&s;ion of compari&s;on from my daughter. Plutarch, after carefully collecting the materials for the lives which he hath written; after weighing every circum&s;tance, and dige&s;ting them with that admirable regularity in which they are handed down to us, is often at a lo&s;s to e&s;timate the <HI>compara|tive</HI> excellence of his heroes. He narrates particulars, places them in a parallel view, and &s;eems rather to leave the deci&s;ion to his readers. My purpo&s;e, in the exerci&s;e which I have exacted, was to in&s;ure your ac|curate attention; well knowing, that the di&s;qui&s;ition of a &s;ubject, a conference on its merits, and, more e&s;pe|cially, tho&s;e re&s;earches which are requi&s;ite to the mak|ing up of an opinion that we are to commit to writing, is the mo&s;t probable means of impre&s;&s;ing the mind. Be&s;ides, we cannot too often contemplate virtuous ac|tions. Stimulated by the approbation that will, indi&s;|putably, &s;ooner or later, attend on rectitude, we be|come
<PB N="116" REF="034162_0462_0FFC6D5A9BBEC880">
enamoured thereof, and, aiming at tho&s;e excel|lencies which may entitle us thereto, we &s;eek to implant in our bo&s;oms every good and proper principle.</P>
<P>The heroes of antiquity, grouped together, may be con&s;idered as a &s;plendid con&s;tellation, illumining tho&s;e tremendous periods, which, fraught with blood and murder, unveiled &s;cenes that &s;eemed to threaten the univer&s;al wreck of nature! Lycurgus, the Lacedemo|nian legi&s;lator, evinced his integrity in the mo&s;t ardu|ous actions of his life; no difficulties were too great for his enterprizing &s;pirit. Zealous for his country's weal, he endured every hard&s;hip; vi&s;iting the learned men in various cities, that he might, by their collected wi&s;dom, become qualified to con&s;ult the general good. His valour was equal to his love of information. In early life he was proof again&s;t the a&s;&s;ault of perfidious beauty; he cheerfully re&s;igned royalty; and, although &s;ome of his regulations, apparently at variance with nature, may be deemed rigorous and cruel, yet we cannot call in que&s;tion his probity, nor the light in which he him&s;elf regarded his in&s;titutions, when we find him voluntarily yielding up his life, in the hope of in&s;uring their perpetual operation.</P>
<P>Solon, the Athenian law-giver, united wi&s;dom and clemency; his philanthropy was demon&s;trated by his <HI>remi&s;&s;ion of debts,</HI> and his exempting the <HI>body from &s;eiz|ure in ca&s;es of in&s;olvency.</HI> He abrogated the bloody laws of Draco, and equity was the ba&s;is of his pro|ceedings: He ordained, al&s;o, that no one &s;hould <HI>&s;peak evil of the dead.</HI> The&s;pis, the immortal father of the drama, was cotemporary with Solon.</P>
<P>Numa Pompilius was a virtuous prince. He &s;eemed born to humanize the ferocity of the Romans; he cul|tivated the arts of peace; and his &s;uppo&s;ed intercour&s;e with the godde&s;s Egeria, giving him the a&s;cendency over the minds of the people, he became indeed a &s;ov|ereign, and he employed his power for the emolument of his &s;ubjects. His acceptance of the royal dignity was in conformity to their per&s;evering importunity, and he ju&s;tified their utmo&s;t confidence. His in&s;titu|tions
<PB N="117" REF="034162_0463_0FFC6D579CD55900">
were de&s;criptive of wi&s;dom; he erected public edifices; he &s;hut up the temple of Janus; and, al|though he exerci&s;ed &s;overeignty for the &s;pace of forty-three years, this temple was never again opened dur|ing his reign. Numa exhibited an example of ju&s;tice, clemency and goodne&s;s; and the benign virtues of humanity prevailed throughout his dominions. The &s;ources of contention were cut off; the gentle breezes of complacency were abroad; the healthful and tran|quillizing occupations of agriculture were diligently pur&s;ued; the authority of religion was e&s;tabli&s;hed; the people &s;aw good days; fe&s;tivity gladdened their hearts; and amu&s;ements, under the au&s;pices of virtue, were e&s;tabli&s;hed. Italy a&s;&s;umed a face of confidence and contentment; an amicable intercour&s;e &s;ucceeded tho&s;e ho&s;tilities which had di&s;tracted the land; a per|&s;ua&s;ion of &s;ecurity obtained, and commerce revived.</P>
<P>Valerius became illu&s;trious by his virtues. He was the <HI>friend of the people;</HI> his conde&s;cen&s;ion to their feel|ings obtained for him the &s;irname of Publicola. He demoli&s;hed, without he&s;itation, the &s;uperb man&s;ion which gave them offence; he inverted the <HI>in&s;ignia</HI> of authority as he approached their a&s;&s;emblies; thus in|ferring his reverence for their &s;entiments, and his ac|knowledgment of their &s;overeignty. By the&s;e judicious conce&s;&s;ions he cut a&s;under the &s;inews of envy, and e&s;|tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in the hearts of the many. He was the fir&s;t Roman con&s;ul that ever mounted a triumphal chariot; and the oration which he delivered at the funeral of Brutus, is &s;aid to have originated that cu&s;|tom among the Romans. Publicola enacted wi&s;e and equitable laws, and he communicated to his admini&s;|tration the requi&s;ite energy. He gave liberty to of|fenders, condemned by the con&s;uls, to appeal to <HI>the people.</HI> No per&s;on could legally exerci&s;e any office, who had not been elected by the free &s;uffrages of <HI>the people; and he exempted the poor from any cu&s;tom,</HI> or <HI>im|po&s;t of any de&s;cription!</HI> He ordained que&s;tors; he exer|ci&s;ed him&s;elf in acts of liberality; and he was indu&s;|trious in e&s;tabli&s;hing all <HI>that equality which is con&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="118" REF="034162_0464_0FFC6D5615FE18B0">
with the regular admini&s;tration of government.</HI> He was an intrepid warrior; he was victorious over the ene|mies of his country; he was frequently elected con&s;ul; his triumphs were repeated; and he died, honoured and regretted. The Roman ladies, to demon&s;trate their high &s;en&s;e of the merit of this illu&s;trious citizen, <HI>appeared in black one whole year after his decea&s;e.</HI> If Solon's definition of happine&s;s is admitted, <HI>Publicola was happy, for he was virtuous; he &s;erved his country honourably as a legi&s;lator and a general, and his &s;ervices were gratefully compen&s;ated. He died amid the continued victories of the republic, which had attained re&s;pectability under his au&s;pices; and to him is referred the &s;plendor and ance&s;try of the noble hou&s;es of the Publicoloe, the Me&s;&s;alloe and Valerii.</HI></P>
<P>Marcus Furius Camillus bore many honourable of|fices under the Roman commonwealth. Perhaps, if we except the Decii and the Regulii of the Roman hi&s;tory, it records few, if any lives, that exhibited more uniform and glowing patrioti&s;m. He was five times cho&s;en dictator; and his deeds of worth rendered the family of Furia illu&s;trious. The authority which de|volved &s;ingly upon him&s;elf, he judiciou&s;ly communicat|ed; and when he was a&s;&s;ociated with others, the ele|vation of his under&s;tanding, giving him to <HI>originate</HI> every &s;ea&s;onable and important regulation, rendered his &s;uperiority apparent. It is remarked of him, that he <HI>commanded without envy,</HI> and that his contemporaries <HI>cheerfully</HI> yielded him the <HI>preference.</HI> It was during a conte&s;t relative to Camillus, that the Roman ladies evinced their patrioti&s;m by parting with their jewels; in con&s;ideration of which, a decree pa&s;&s;ed the &s;enate, that orations &s;hould be pronounced at the funeral of meritorious women. The indignation with which Ca|millus received the infamous pedagogue who betrayed the Falerian youth, ba&s;ely conducting the &s;tudents committed to his care into the Roman camp, and his equitable deci&s;ion relative to the traitor, demon&s;trates the wi&s;dom and integrity of his character; while his re|marks, on that memorable occa&s;ion, are de&s;criptive of
<PB N="119" REF="034162_0465_0FFC6D525AACD3B0">
magnanimity, heroi&s;m and rectitude. <HI>War,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is of it&s;elf a &s;ufficient evil; oppre&s;&s;ion, cruelty and blood&s;hed are in its train: Neverthele&s;s, the man of probity will &s;till &s;quare his actions by the rule of right; he will not accept a victory obtained by perfidy; but he will tru&s;t to his own valour to procure for him that deci&s;ion, which the ju&s;|tice of his cau&s;e may authorize him to expect.</HI> Virtue, as it often happens, was, in this ca&s;e, its own reward. The unexpected re&s;toration of the Falerian children, with the marks of ignominy be&s;towed upon the per|fidious preceptor, were circum&s;tances which enkindled in the bo&s;oms of the well near di&s;tracted parents, the mo&s;t ardent veneration for the Roman character; and while their emancipated &s;ons extolled Camillus as their father, their god and their deliverer, amba&s;&s;adors were immediately di&s;patched to the Romans, and an advan|tageous and a bloodle&s;s peace was obtained.</P>
<P>Yet Camillus, at a period when he was involved in the deepe&s;t dome&s;tic calamity, when the cheek of the warrior was wet with the tears which fell over the early grave of the &s;on of his bo&s;om, became the victim of ingratitude! Arraigned by the ill-founded malice of the people, he anticipated judgment, and only e&s;|caped an ignominious &s;entence, by &s;ubmitting to vol|untary bani&s;hment. But, unlike Coriolanus, during his exile, his good genius &s;till hovered round the city of Rome, and, as her guardian angel, he watched over her for good. The Gauls attacked and de&s;troyed the city, ma&s;&s;acreing the &s;enators in their robes of dig|nity; but the exiled hero was fruitful in re&s;ources, and his mo&s;t arduous efforts were embodied for the relief of his de&s;olated country. As a private &s;oldier, a&s;&s;ociating with a veteran band, he obtained a &s;ignal victory over the common enemy; <HI>and, &s;o &s;acred did he hold the authority legally appointed, that he refu&s;ed the com|mand which he was &s;olicited to a&s;&s;ume, until the repre&s;ent|atives of the State, then be&s;ieged in the capitol, &s;hould elect him to that office!</HI> The heroi&s;m of an individual pro|cured the nece&s;&s;ary inve&s;titure; and, thus armed with <HI>regular powers,</HI> his actions proclaimed the patriot, the

He led an army again&s;t Bren|nus; di&s;appointed the mercenary views of that Gaul; &s;et the battle in array; obtained a deci&s;ive victory; extricated his native city; entered Rome amid the ac|clamations of the citizens, and was received with every po&s;&s;ible demon&s;tration of joy! Camillus rebuilt the city of Rome, and was honoured by the appellation of its &s;econd founder. He enjoyed, for the fourth time, that triumph which he had &s;o well de&s;erved! In &s;hort, he attained the highe&s;t &s;ummit of human glory.</P>
<P>Cincinnatus is enrolled in the brighte&s;t annals of fame! His magnanimity, his abilities and his moder|ation merit the &s;ublime&s;t eulogy. Departing from the rural haunts of peaceful virtue, he &s;aved Rome, obtained a triumph, and returned to that retirement, where he had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully reared to maturity that noble patrioti&s;m, which, in the hour of danger, had nerved his arm, and led him forth to victory!</P>
<P>Cimon, the Athenian, it is &s;aid, "<HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e qualities that dignify the &s;oul.</HI>" He was zealous for his country's weal; his politics were upright; he was an accompli&s;hed general; mode&s;t, when rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t employments and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed honours, liberal and beneficent, &s;imple, and aver&s;e to o&s;tenta|tion. He had the glory of <HI>curbing</HI> the vanity of his countrymen, and di&s;&s;uading them from acting tyran|nically; and he uniformly inveighed again&s;t that pro|pen&s;ity, which taught them to &s;acrifice virtue to profit, and honour to power.</P>
<P>Philopoemen, <HI>produced in the old age of Greece,</HI> is characterized as the la&s;t of her &s;ons. He was an un|daunted warrior; he trained his countrymen to arms, and led them forth to victory: Many were his valorous deeds; and he continued, through a long life, the de|termined enemy of tyrants. The integrity of Philo|poemen was not to be corrupted; and &s;uch were the impre&s;&s;ions of his rectitude, that no Lacedemonian dared to offer him a bribe. The citizens of Sparta wi&s;hed to tender him the &s;ums, accruing from the &s;ale
<PB N="121" REF="034162_0467_0FFC6D4D80F5AAA0">
of tho&s;e valuable articles, which had been the proper|ty of the tyrant whom he had &s;ubdued by his valour: But they were aware that much addre&s;s was requi&s;ite, and they committed the bu&s;ine&s;s to Timolaus; who, after undertaking it, upon ob&s;erving the wi&s;dom, ju&s;|tice, temperance and moderation of Philopoemen, de&s;pairing of &s;ucceeding, pronounced him &s;uperior to &s;eduction, and returned to his employers without exe|cuting his commi&s;&s;ion! A &s;econd attempt was alike ineffectual; a third trial, however, enabled him to produce the gratuity; when Philopoemen, rejecting the large&s;s, calmly ob&s;erved to the Spartans, that it would be economical to re&s;erve their gold for tho&s;e <HI>unprincipled men, who&s;e nefarious purpo&s;es</HI> might el&s;e ac|compli&s;h the public ruin.</P>
<P>Philopoemen was the eighth time appointed general of the Achaeans, after he had completed the &s;eventieth year of his age! What mortal could achieve he great|ly wrought: But misfortunes overtook the winter of his days. He was impri&s;oned by Dinocrates; and when the impoi&s;oned chalice was placed in his hands, he que&s;tioned the me&s;&s;enger of death relative to the hor&s;emen who were in his train, and upon being in|formed they had e&s;caped, he replied with a &s;mile, "<HI>It is well</HI>&mdash;<HI>we are not every way unfortunate;</HI>" and, &s;wallowing the fatal draught, uttered not another &s;en|tence! The Achaeans revenged his death. The body of the hero was placed upon the funeral pile&mdash;the con|&s;ecrated urn received the a&s;hes, and it was adorned with garlands of flowers. Polybius, the hi&s;torian, conveyed it to his native city. The whole army, drawn up in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, attended the venerable re|mains. People, of all ranks and conditions, flocked from the towns and villages, to meet the &s;ad retinue; pre&s;&s;ing, with tears and lamentations, to touch and embrace that &s;acred urn, in which was depo&s;ited all that was mortal of him, who had &s;o often delivered them from impending evil. He was interred with ev|ery demon&s;tration of re&s;pect; and &s;tatues aro&s;e to his memory in all the principal cities of Greece.</P>

But Plutarch pronounces deci&s;ively, that neither Philopoemen, nor any other warrior, can be compared to Titus Quintius Flaminius, in regard to benefits conferred upon the Grecian States. Titus combined gentlene&s;s of manners and piety with his valour. He was &s;teady in his friend&s;hips; and his clemency to a conquered foe was exemplified in many in&s;tances. He was judicious in his arrangements: deliberation preceded his actions; and his bravery was tempered by wi&s;dom. Being victorious over Philip of Macedon, he left him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his realm and crown; and he manife&s;ted great tenderne&s;s to the Etolians.</P>
<P>I pity the reader who is not elevated to a tone of extacy, when, borne on the wings of imagination, he pre&s;ents him&s;elf amid the a&s;&s;embled Grecians, and li&s;|tens to the proclamation of the Roman herald.</P>
<P>Greece had been torn by inte&s;tine di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and alternately the prey of contending nations. At length, &s;ubdued by the Romans, &s;he looked for de&s;poti&s;m and bondage. The Macedonians were expelled; they were totally di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all their conque&s;ts in Greece, and their garri&s;ons were, by con&s;equence, re|moved.</P>
<P>They were without a remedy, wholly at the mercy of the victor. That the Romans would relinqui&s;h the cities they had conquered, was improbable; the very idea was infinitely ab&s;urd and romantic. Solacing them&s;elves, however, with the pro&s;pect of that repo&s;e which peace might confer, they prepare to celebrate the I&s;thmian games. A va&s;t concour&s;e of people are a&s;&s;embled&mdash;every heart is replete with expectation&mdash;per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank mingle in the crowd&mdash;a decree is to be promulgated; <HI>a decree of their conquer|ors; and their fate hangs upon the lips of tho&s;e who have obtained the power of deci&s;ion.</HI> Hope and fear alternate|ly prevail; but the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectancy could only calculate upon being indulged with a mild &s;y&s;|tem of government.

<P>"<HI>IS not the character of Ari&s;tides perfect?</HI>" This is the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. Let us, my love, pro|ceed to a careful inve&s;tigation thereof, and our an|&s;wer will follow of cour&s;e. It appears that Ari&s;tides was, indeed, <HI>eminently virtuous;</HI> and, that although highly capable of friend&s;hip, his attachments could never render him unju&s;t. His deci&s;ions, when &s;itting in the &s;eat of judgment, were not influenced by a &s;en&s;e of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> injuries. "<HI>Friend,</HI>" &s;aid he, to a plaintiff who &s;ought to bias him in favour of his &s;uit, by repre|&s;enting the aggre&s;&s;or as the adver&s;ary of Ari&s;tides; <Q><HI>Friend, tell me only what injuries he has done to thee; for it is thy cau&s;e, and not mine, which I &s;et to judge.</HI></Q> He was mode&s;t, and aver&s;e from o&s;tentation, nor was he ambitious of the pageantry of office.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="034162_0471_0FFC6D4290D9E378">
He was highly patriotic; the public good was the prime object of his pur&s;uit; and, to a con&s;ideration &s;o im|portant, he cheerfully pro&s;trated his individual glory; yet, in fact, he thus rendered him&s;elf truly illu&s;trious. I regard the action, by which Ari&s;tides relinqui&s;hed his authority to Miltiades, among the mo&s;t &s;plendid of his life; the con&s;equences were happy; he thus extermin|ated the noxious &s;eeds of jealou&s;y and contention, which, taking root, gave indications of a plentiful growth; and he taught the Grecian warriors the ad|vantage of being led to battle by a veteran, experi|enced in the toils and arts of war; nor could inferior chiefs, thenceforward, refu&s;e to follow an example &s;o evidently productive of general utility. Ju&s;tice is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t prominent virtue which Ari&s;tides po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed; it rai&s;ed him from the humble walks of life to the highe&s;t honours his country could confer; and the a&s;cendency with which it inve&s;ted him, giving a colour to the plea, that the liberties of Athens were in danger, became the foundation of that verdict of the <HI>o&s;traci&s;m,</HI> by which he was bani&s;hed. "Hath Ari&s;tides ever injured you?" &s;aid the hero, to an illiterate &s;tran|ger, who, ignorant to whom he applied, reque&s;ted him to in&s;cribe the devoted name upon the &s;hell. "Not in the lea&s;t," replied the cynic, "neither do I &s;o much as know him; but I am weary of hearing every where of <HI>Ari&s;tides the ju&s;t.</HI>"</P>
<P>His prayer, at departing from Athens, breathed the true &s;pirit of that kind of philanthropy, which is nearly allied to Deity; and his conduct during his bani&s;hment, together with his coalition with Themi&s;tocles, taking mea&s;ures, <HI>from devotion to the public good, to advance to the highe&s;t eminence, the reputation of an inveterate foe, gives him an incontrovertible right to that &s;plendid immor|tality, which is entitled to deathle&s;s prai&s;e.</HI> Who can &s;et bounds to their admiration, when they behold the enterpri&s;ing hero, bidding defiance to every danger&mdash;forcing his way, at the extreme&s;t peril, through the enemy's fleet, and &s;uddenly pre&s;enting him&s;elf in the tent of Themi&s;tocles, not with the language of re|proach,
<PB N="126" REF="034162_0472_0FFC6D40176D6020">
but in a tone that announced the friend of his country, glowing with unabating zeal for her intere&s;t, and ready to devote him&s;elf to her &s;ervice?</P>
<P>The virtues of Ari&s;tides &s;eem, on this occa&s;ion, to have attained the highe&s;t pitch of which humanity is &s;u&s;ceptible; the intrigues of Themi&s;tocles had procured his bani&s;hment, and the invidious calumniator was then inve&s;ted with that authority, to which the &s;ervices and tran&s;cendent merit of the illu&s;trious exile had given him an indi&s;putable title! Yet he is &s;uperior to re&s;ent|ment&mdash;he takes no retro&s;pect of injuries. The &s;tate of Athens is in danger, and he utters not a recriminating &s;entence! In one word, he approximates to divinity. The concentrated riches of the univer&s;e, in the e&s;tima|tion of Ari&s;tides, would not have been held as an equivalent for the liberties of Greece; and had he &s;till &s;ojourned in mortality, he would have waged war with her enemies, &s;o long as the &s;un and the moon endured.</P>
<P>His benign efforts were indu&s;triou&s;ly employed to mollify the enkindling re&s;entments of chiefs, engaging in the common cau&s;e; and he gained every thing by his pacific interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>His addre&s;s relative to the di&s;affected Grecians, can|not be too much applauded; nor do I conceive, that, in this in&s;tance, he &s;acrificed ju&s;tice, &s;ince the two de|linquents, again&s;t whom he proceeded, were confe&s;&s;edly the <HI>mo&s;t culpable,</HI> and the re&s;t were referred to the battle, as an ordeal, by which they might &s;ilence the clamours of accu&s;ation, and produce a conviction that they had never imagined any thing prejudicial to the welfare of Greece. Ari&s;tides exemplified both his policy and his ju&s;tice, by the decree which declared the victorious citizens alike eligible to the offices of government, and which authorized an <HI>impartial election of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> the great body of the people.</HI></P>
<P>We find Ari&s;tides repeatedly oppo&s;ing him&s;elf to the treacherous policy of Themi&s;tocles, and it appears that the Athenians at length knew how to appreciate properly, the abilities and the virtues of tho&s;e two
<PB N="127" REF="034162_0473_0FFC6D3D34A52858">
warriors. I have conceived a de&s;ign, &s;aid Themi&s;to|cles, which will be of va&s;t advantage to the State, but its &s;ucce&s;s depends upon its continuing a profound &s;ecret. Communicate your de&s;ign to Ari&s;tides, cried the Athenians, and we will abide by his deci&s;ion. The project was, to burn the combined navy of Greece, which conflagration would have inve&s;ted Athens with &s;overeignty. But one judgment can be formed of this &s;cheme&mdash;it was infamou&s;ly perfidious. "<HI>Nothing,</HI>" &s;aid Ari&s;tides, as he gave in his report to the a&s;&s;embly&mdash;"<HI>could be more advantageous, and nothing could be more unju&s;t.</HI>" We conceive a high idea of the <HI>integrity of the Athenians, and of their unbounded confidence in Ari&s;|tides,</HI> when we hear them, without waiting to inve&s;ti|gate, command Themi&s;tocles to relinqui&s;h his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The dignified conde&s;cen&s;ion of Ari&s;tides induced the confederated forces to &s;olicit his acceptation of the general command of their united army; and his matchle&s;s integrity con&s;trained the Lacedemonians to &s;upplicate the Athenians, that he might have leave of ab&s;ence, while he examined, in per&s;on, the compli|cated revenues, and a&s;&s;igned to every citizen their due proportion of the expen&s;es accruing from the general burden of the war. Yet this per&s;onage, rendered illu&s;trious by an a&s;&s;emblage of virtues, led a life of poverty, and daily practi&s;ed a clo&s;e ob&s;ervance of the mo&s;t rigid frugality. His candour and moderation were frequently apparent. Themi&s;tocles continued the determined foe of his virtues; yet he "<HI>refu&s;ed to join in the pro&s;ecution of that citizen,</HI>" when his practices being unveiled, he was finally accu&s;ed of capital crimes, and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too much real dignity of mind, to in&s;ult him in his misfortunes.</P>
<P>My Margaretta repeats her que&s;tion, "<HI>Is not the character of Ari&s;tides perfect?</HI>" I an&s;wer&mdash;we have hith|erto only attended to the fair &s;ide of his conduct. Perhaps Ari&s;tides attained to as much rectitude of life, as hath ever yet fallen to the &s;hare of a being who is &s;ubject to the a&s;&s;aults of pa&s;&s;ion, who is the &s;port of contingencies, and who too frequently finds him&s;elf
<PB N="128" REF="034162_0474_0FFC6D3ABB6E4778">
involved in a labyrinth of error. But neither Ari&s;tides nor any other <HI>mere mortal,</HI> &s;ince the defection of him who was placed in the garden of Eden, hath ever yet been, <HI>&s;trictly &s;peaking, wholly exempted</HI> from the effects of that imbecility, which, from the abovementioned pe|riod, hath, more or le&s;s, pervaded human nature. But Plutarch &s;ays, "<HI>that he was firm and &s;teady in his behaviour, immoveable in every thing that appeared ju&s;t, and incapable of u&s;ing the lea&s;t fal&s;ehood, flattery, di&s;gui&s;e, or deceit, &s;o much as in je&s;t.</HI>" True, he does &s;o, and this very a&s;&s;ertion is another proof of the imperfection of <HI>poor human nature.</HI> Plutarch is highly re&s;pectable as an hi&s;torian, and yet his life of Ari&s;tides expre&s;sly contradicts this &s;ummary which he has given us of his character; for, be&s;ides that, he &s;eems to adopt the opinion, that the enmity of Ari&s;tides and Themi&s;to|cles originated in an <HI>unwarrantable</HI> attachment, which they had mutually conceived to a beautiful individual. He repre&s;ents <HI>Ari&s;tides the ju&s;t</HI> as &s;trenuou&s;ly combating a mea&s;ure of great importance and advantage, <HI>merely becau&s;e it had been propo&s;ed by Themi&s;tocles!</HI> I confe&s;s, on this occa&s;ion, he acted in contradiction to the general rectitude of his mind; <HI>but he did act,</HI> and a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of the impropriety of his conduct, extorted from him a confe&s;&s;ion, "that the Athenians would never be &s;afe, <HI>till they threw Themi&s;tocles and him&s;elf into the Barathrum.</HI>"</P>
<P>I am aware that his matured judgment amply cor|rected this error; but neither were his riper years en|tirely free from blame. As a trea&s;urer, he di&s;charged his tru&s;t with that integrity which made &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part of his character; but upon &s;urrendering up his accounts, being accu&s;ed by Themi&s;tocles, and other nefarious incendiaries, of embezzling the public monies, although he was honourably acquitted by the <HI>chief and be&s;t men of the city, and continued in his office,</HI> he affected, during the cour&s;e of a complete year, an utter derelic|tion of his former probity; he courted the approbation of tho&s;e who robbed the public, and pa&s;&s;ed their ac|counts, without that equitable inve&s;tigation and detec|tion
<PB N="129" REF="034162_0475_0FFC6D385248ADE8">
of treachery, to which he had been accu&s;tomed. It is true, that upon his &s;econd re-election, he thus ob|tained the privilege of rebuking the Athenians, by the following addre&s;s: <Q><HI>When I di&s;charged my office faithfully and honourably, I was reviled and di&s;graced: but now, when I have &s;uffered your trea&s;ury to be robbed by the&s;e public plunderers, I am admired and applauded at the be&s;t of citizens.</HI></Q> It is al&s;o true, that this plan might be politic. Athens, thus warned, probably reaped the benefit in her &s;ub&s;equent regulations and appoint|ments; but &s;urely it is a circum&s;tance which de&s;troys the a&s;&s;ertion of his biographer, for he appears during the tran&s;actions of a year, <HI>capable of "u&s;ing fal&s;ehood and deceit."</HI> Thus, if we would not be mi&s;&s;ed, the nece&s;&s;ity of an accurate inve&s;tigation of even the be&s;t authors, becomes obvious.</P>
<P>But having adju&s;ted our fir&s;t point, we proceed to the &s;econd. You have very naturally accounted for your predilection in favour of Edward I.; but your favourite poet has enriched the drama, by rendering another Engli&s;h monarch the hero of his production. Alfred the Great was &s;urely not inferior even to Ari&s;tides. I will confe&s;s to you, my daughter, that I have never read the hi&s;tory of this prince without the mo&s;t animated and plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations. I may be an enthu&s;ia&s;t in my admiration of his virtues; but he appears to me to have united in him&s;elf every ex|cellence which can dignify or adorn humanity; and I experience a degree of elevation, in the con&s;ideration that this magnanimous monarch was of that order of beings, in which nature hath conferred on me, al&s;o, the gift of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Let us, my good girl, take a cur&s;ory view of the &s;plendid actions which rendered illu&s;trious one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed lives that is to be found in the an|nals of human nature. The favourite &s;on of a father, who, from misjudging fondne&s;s, neglected his education; we find him, at the age of twelve years, ignorant of the lowe&s;t rudiments of literature; but the productions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ard, recounting the valorous deeds

of heroes, are rehear&s;ed in his pre&s;ence, and his noble faculties are rou&s;ed to action; an ardent thir&s;t of knowledge, and de&s;ire of virtue, pervades his bo&s;om, and his <HI>maternal parent</HI> cheri&s;hes the princely emula|tion, which is thus happily originated. The elevated and penetrating genius of Alfred was &s;uperior to every impediment. Both Engli&s;h and Latin were &s;oon attained, and his progre&s;s in every u&s;eful and ornamental &s;tudy was a&s;toni&s;hing. The death of his father placed his brother Ethelred upon the throne, by whom he was deprived of his patrimony; yet, relinqui&s;hing at the &s;hrine of public &s;afety, his &s;en&s;e of individual wrongs, he bravely fought the battles of his brother. Providence at length inve&s;ted him with the &s;overeign authority; but his dominions were previou&s;ly reduced to the very brink of de&s;truction, and his pro&s;|pects were indeed truly lamentable. The progre&s;s of the Danes was fearfully rapid. Agriculture was arre&s;ted in its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential operations&mdash;the grounds remained uncultivated&mdash;the &s;acred temples were laid in a&s;hes&mdash;every re&s;ource &s;eemed cut off, and de&s;pair, with tremendous a&s;pect, &s;talked through the de&s;olated land! yet virtue, valour and wi&s;dom united in the per&s;on of Alfred&mdash;the trio was augu&s;t&mdash;it was equal to the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing achievements&mdash;the clouds gradually di&s;per&s;ed&mdash;every evil was redre&s;&s;ed&mdash;and confidence, regularity and felicity were re&s;tored!</P>
<P>ALFRED, ju&s;tly receiving the epithet GREAT, was anointed by Heaven, the deliverer, re&s;torer and pro|tector of his pro&s;trate country; and although his fir&s;t on&s;ets were un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the Danes &s;till continued their barbarous ravages, yet no misfortune could repre&s;s his heroic ardour; but yielding, for a &s;ea&s;on, to tho&s;e melancholy nece&s;&s;ities, impo&s;ed by an enemy, rendered powerful by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive victories, who&s;e per|fidy no treaty could bind, and con&s;trained al&s;o by the &s;uper&s;titious fears of tho&s;e few followers who remained, he relinqui&s;hed the en&s;igns of royalty, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his attendants, and, clad in a &s;hepherd's garb, he took his way to the cottage of a herd&s;man, to whom his rank
<PB N="131" REF="034162_0477_0FFC6D3548AAE328">
was unknown; where, in this di&s;gui&s;e, he continued, impatiently expecting the hour, when he might advan|tageou&s;ly pre&s;ent him&s;elf, and reduce to practice tho&s;e preconcerted plans, which were to emancipate his bleeding country. Equal to every &s;ituation in life, he &s;upported him&s;elf with propriety during this rever&s;e of fortune. Mu&s;ic con&s;tituted the prime &s;ource of his amu&s;ement, and hope illumined his hours. Thom&s;on lays the &s;cene of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of his dramatic productions, in this rural abode of royalty. The Ma&s;que of Alfred opens with a dialogue of the &s;hep|herd and his wife, re&s;pecting the &s;tranger who re&s;ided in their cottage. It commences in the following beautiful manner:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Emma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shepherd, 'tis he. Beneath yon aged oak, all on the flowery turf he lays him down.</P>

<SPEAKER>Corin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soft! let us not di&s;turb him, gentle Emma. <HI>Poor though he be; unfriended and unknown; my pity waits with reverence on his fortune.</HI> Mode&s;t of carriage, and of &s;peech mo&s;t gracious. As if &s;ome &s;aint or angel in di&s;gui&s;e had graced our lowly cot|tage with his pre&s;ence&mdash;he &s;teals, I know not how, into the heart, and makes it pant to &s;erve him. Tru&s;t me, Emma, he is no common man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some lord, perhaps, or valiant chief, that from our deadly foe, the haughty, cruel, unbe|lieving Dane, &s;eeks &s;helter here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Corin.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;helter he &s;hall find. <HI>Who loves his country, is my friend and brother.</HI> Behold him well. Fair virtue in his a&s;pect, even through the homely ru&s;&s;et that conceals him, &s;hines forth, and proves him noble.

<P>The &s;ucceeding &s;cene between Alfred and the Earl of Devon, is deeply intere&s;ting; but as your father intends reading for us this evening Thom&s;on's Alfred, I forbear a continuation of my extracts.</P>
<P>The au&s;picious era at length dawned, and the di&s;|per&s;ed Saxons once more rallied round the &s;tandard of their prince. But a hazardous enterprize remained;
<PB N="132" REF="034162_0478_0FFC6D2FDBD54650">
a knowledge of the numbers and &s;ituation of the foe was ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen&s;able; and Alfred, at a lo&s;s to whom to confide an undertaking &s;o important, devoted him&s;elf to the perilous inve&s;tigation! In his ru&s;tic habiliments, with his harp in his hand, he pa&s;&s;ed the Dani&s;h lines&mdash;amu&s;ed the &s;oldiers&mdash;addre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;oothing &s;trains, the admiring officers; and thus procuring an introduction to the Dani&s;h prince, con|tinued with him many days; until, obtaining the requi&s;ite information, he departed to that retreat from whence he i&s;&s;ued tho&s;e commands which placed him at the head of an army, re&s;olutely determined to make for their lives and their liberties a vigorous &s;tand! The con&s;equence was glorious. The Danes, a&s;toni&s;hed to behold again in the field, a power which they had con&s;idered as totally annihilated, gave way on every, &s;ide; a deci&s;ive victory was obtained; and, although tho&s;e who e&s;caped, again intrenched them&s;elves, yet &s;peedily &s;urrendering at di&s;cretion, they experienced the clemency of the conqueror. From this period Alfred continued victorious; a &s;eries of brilliant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es utterly expelled the treacherous invaders, while the fleet which he appointed, de&s;troyed their ve&s;&s;els, and defended the Engli&s;h coa&s;t. It was now that he attained the extreme acme of human glory. His territories were extended far beyond the domain of his predece&s;&s;ors. The Wel&s;h monarchs acknowledged his &s;uperiority; the Northumbrians accepted the &s;ove|reign whom he appointed; no enemy remained; and general peace was re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Twelve years of profound tranquillity en&s;ued, and Alfred appropriated this interval to the originating, re&s;toring and e&s;tabli&s;hing whatever could be con&s;id|ered as contributing to the welfare of his &s;ubjects, whom he regarded as his children. The cities rav|aged by the Danes, were rebuilt; a regular militia, well ordered and equipped, was embodied. He num|bered and regi&s;tered the people, and, placing weapons in their hands, he taught them to defend them&s;elves. He divided the kingdom into cla&s;&s;es, a&s;&s;igning to each
<PB N="133" REF="034162_0479_0FFC6D2E58ADD348">
a re&s;pective routine of duty; thus the lands were cultivated, while well appointed and duly regulated bands held them&s;elves in readine&s;s to repel an invading foe. The navy, al&s;o, obtained a due &s;hare of his fo&s;ter|ing care; an able and completely furni&s;hed fleet, con|&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and twenty &s;hips of war, were &s;tationed along the Albion coa&s;t; and the Engli&s;h, in this reign, became expert in &s;ailing and in naval en|gagements; and thus were &s;ucceeding incur&s;ions ad|vantageou&s;ly repul&s;ed.</P>
<P>He next turned his attention to the embelli&s;hment of the kingdom which he had thus delivered and pro|tected; he enacted laws, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the mo&s;t judicious regulations. The wi&s;dom of his civil in&s;ti|tutions is highly celebrated. The trial by jury, that grand palladium of ju&s;tice, is a&s;cribed to him; and to &s;uch perfection had he conducted the &s;y&s;tem which he originated, and &s;o well did the morals of his &s;ubjects harmonize therewith, that he is &s;aid to have ordered bracelets of gold to be hung up in the high-way, as a challenge to robbers, which bracelets remained in perfect &s;ecurity. He was the uniform friend and patron of literature; this nece&s;&s;arily ameliorated the manners, and humanized the habits of the people. He mounted the throne at a period when his &s;ubjects were enveloped in the mo&s;t profound ignorance. The <HI>character of the age was ferocious;</HI> and the fluctuating &s;tate of the Engli&s;h government, together with the depredation of the Danes more e&s;pecially, impre&s;&s;ed upon that nation the features of barbari&s;m. The Latin tongue was almo&s;t wholly unknown in England; and Alfred took mea&s;ures to allure to his dominions the mo&s;t learned men of Chri&s;tendom. He renovated the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, and conferred on that &s;eminary many privileges. He was truly economical of his own time, regulating his hours to the be&s;t advantage, and appropriating them mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly: Grammar, rhetoric, philo&s;ophy, architecture, and geometry, con|&s;tituted a part of his &s;tudies. He is celebrated as an hi&s;torian; his knowledge in mu&s;ic is &s;aid to have been
<PB N="134" REF="034162_0480_0FFC6D2A79D705A8">
re&s;pectable; and his poetical talents were in high e&s;teem. He was fond of allegory; he tran&s;lated from the Greek, the fables of AE&s;op; and many of his pro|ductions are handed down to the pre&s;ent day! Thus did the example of the &s;overeign furni&s;h a powerful incentive to application and improvement. He al&s;o liberally encouraged the mechanical arts. His palaces were con&s;tructed of brick, and his example was properly influential. He patronized manufactures of every de&s;cription; and every u&s;eful invention, was, by the munificence of the prince, &s;uitably rewarded. Com|merce and navigation, which he invariably cheri&s;hed, furni&s;hed him with the elegancies of life; and England was at length taught how to appreciate the value of ju&s;tice, tranquillity and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>"It was," &s;ays a re&s;pectable hi&s;torian, <Q>after a glorious reign of twenty-nine years thus &s;pent in the advancement of his &s;ubjects' happine&s;s, that he died in the vigour of his age, and the full enjoyment of his faculties; an <HI>example to princes, and an ornament to human nature.</HI> To give a character of this prince, would only be to &s;um up tho&s;e qualities which con&s;titute perfection. Even virtues &s;eemingly oppo|&s;ite, were happily blended in his di&s;po&s;ition; <HI>per&s;eve|ring,</HI> yet <HI>flexible; moderate,</HI> yet <HI>enterpri&s;ing; ju&s;t,</HI> yet <HI>merciful; &s;tern in command,</HI> yet <HI>gentle in conver&s;ation.</HI> Nature, al&s;o, as if de&s;irous that &s;uch admirable qualities of mind &s;hould be &s;et off to the greate&s;t advantage, had be&s;towed on him all bodily accom|pli&s;hments&mdash;vigour, dignity, and an engaging open countenance. In &s;hort, writers have taken &s;uch delight in de&s;cribing the hero, that they have totally <HI>omitted the mention of his &s;maller errors, which doubtle&s;s he mu&s;t have had, in con&s;equence of his humanity.</HI></Q></P>

<P>THE lively imagination which you, my dear, po&s;|&s;e&s;s, together with your exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibilities, &s;o properly balanced by rea&s;on and by judgment, cannot, I think, but be productive of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing con&s;e|quences. Your &s;trong emotions as you read, will &s;erve to impre&s;s on your mind the events you contem|plate, and thus you will trea&s;ure up a fund, which will, through life, con&s;titute a &s;ource of emolument and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Your &s;entiments of Elizabeth are &s;uch as her con|duct to Mary very naturally originate; and it is cer|tain, that her cruelty to that prince&s;s would have &s;tamped, even upon the life of an angel, impre&s;&s;ions of guilt, never to be effaced; and yet it cannot be denied that <HI>Elizabeth was capable of dignified actions.</HI> I approve your preference of Stuart. The hi&s;torian engaged in exonerating from reproach the memory of the dead, is, I conceive, entitled to prai&s;e; and I can more ea|&s;ily forgive the writer, who multiplies or exaggerates the virtues of decea&s;ed per&s;ons, than he who <HI>imputes to them crimes which, while living, they dete&s;ted!</HI> The vio|lence done to Dido, in this re&s;pect, cannot, I have imagined, be ju&s;tified, even by the <HI>licen&s;e which is al|lowed to poets.</HI> The be&s;t authors concur in repre&s;ent|ing Eliza, or Dido, as a mo&s;t intrepid and magnani|mous prince&s;s. Deprived, by the hand of a barbarous
<PB N="136" REF="034162_0482_0FFC6D26A6E04D10">
brother, of the hu&s;band of her youth, to whom it ap|pears &s;he was <HI>fondly attached,</HI> and attended by her &s;i&s;|ter and a few faithful followers, &s;he fled from her na|tive realm; when, encountering with heroic fortitude, the hard&s;hips in&s;eparable from her enterprize, &s;he found|ed, or e&s;tabli&s;hed, the city of Carthage; &s;he enlarged and beautified it; &s;he inclo&s;ed it by a &s;trong wall, and erected in it a citadel; her &s;ubjects rapidly increa&s;ed; &s;he laid the foundation of a flouri&s;hing commerce; and her admini&s;tration combined ju&s;tice, wi&s;dom and prudence. Her in&s;titutions, and the form of govern|ment which &s;he introduced, are pronounced by <HI>Ari&s;|totle, the mo&s;t perfect that had ever been known in the world;</HI> and Polybius informs us, that monarchy, ari&s;|tocracy and democracy, all concentred therein.</P>
<P>Her attachment to the memory of her murdered hu&s;band continued inviolable. Agreeably to the idol|atrous cu&s;tom of the times, &s;he ordered divine honours to be paid to him; and while &s;he was indefatigable in her endeavours to promote the advancement of her &s;ubjects, &s;he remained wedded to his memory; thus exhibiting a pattern of female delicacy, propriety and faithfulne&s;s. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the happine&s;s which &s;he communicated tranquillized her bo&s;om, and her life would have clo&s;ed &s;erenely, but for the intere&s;ted propo&s;als of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">bas, a neighbouring prince, who &s;ought her in marriage. The Carthaginians, fearful of of|fending their &s;overeign by an explicit communication of the overture, practi&s;ed that kind of punic &s;ubtilty, for which they were afterwards &s;o remarkable; and the un&s;u&s;pecting Dido, en&s;nared by their addre&s;s, found her&s;elf in a &s;ituation, which, of all others, &s;he mo&s;t deprecated. With &s;treaming eyes &s;he appealed to her decea&s;ed lord, and, continuing firm to her plighted vows, laying her hand upon her brea&s;t, with dignified re&s;ignation &s;he pronounced. "<HI>Give me three months for deliberation, and I will go where my own fate and that of my people calls me.</HI>" In this interval the funeral pile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ro&s;e, which a&s;cending preci&s;ely at the &s;tipulated mo|ment, &s;he voluntarily relinqui&s;hed a life, which &s;he

<P><HI>This is the Dido of the hi&s;torian,</HI> and authors a&s;cribe to her uncommon attractions and an <HI>unconquerable cha&s;tity.</HI> Yet &s;he is precipitated from the &s;ublime height upon which her achievements and her merit hath placed her, and de&s;cribed <HI>in an immortal poem, which hath been, and will be read by thou&s;ands who never look into hi&s;tory, as a la&s;civious wanton! The &s;lave of imbecility, &s;acrificing the prime honour of womanhood, and finally becoming the victim of an illicit pa&s;&s;ion!</HI> Strange as this (I had almo&s;t &s;aid &s;acrilegious) violation ap|pears, our a&s;toni&s;hment is heightened, when we learn that &s;ome writers deny that Dido was even a cotem|porary with AEneas! Surely <HI>this licentious degradation of a character, eminent for virtue and abilities, was unworthy the rare talents and acknowledged benevolence of the Mantuan bard.</HI></P>
<P>You will &s;ee, my love, as my prime object in the&s;e letters is, to engage you in the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, that this exordium is not altogether digre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Doctor Stuart propo&s;es him&s;elf as the <HI>hi&s;torian,</HI> and not as the <HI>panegyri&s;t</HI> of Mary; and <HI>as his means of inform|ation were probably as direct and infallible as tho&s;e of any other writer,</HI> I yield him my <HI>cheerful</HI> and <HI>grateful</HI> cre|dence. <HI>Mary, as delineated by Stuart, de&s;cends to po&s;terity, an intere&s;ting and deeply injured prince&s;s.</HI> Deprived of her father in the early bud of infancy, the complexion of the times rendered it expedient, that, pa&s;&s;ing from the care of her mother, &s;he &s;hould receive her education in France. The opening powers of her mind autho|rized the faire&s;t expectations; her di&s;po&s;ition was amiably mild, and her under&s;tanding was even &s;plen|did; &s;he was a proficient in elegant needle work; &s;he obtained an accurate knowledge of the Latin tongue; &s;he could conver&s;e with propriety and fluency in French, Italian, and Spani&s;h; &s;he attained a high degree of excellence in painting, poetry and mu&s;ic; her dancing was inimitable, and her movements com|bined a grace irre&s;i&s;tibly enchanting. Many writers
<PB N="138" REF="034162_0484_0FFC6D2297F0C0F0">
have expatiated on the beauty and elegance of her exterior; and her per&s;onal and mental attractions, rendered her charming beyond any woman of the age in which &s;he lived. Her early years pa&s;&s;ed under the happie&s;t au&s;pices, and her marriage with the Dauphin, opened her way to the highe&s;t regal dignity. Mount|ing the throne of France, &s;he was placed in a &s;phere which &s;he was well calculated to fill, and her talents and her virtues became properly con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>But alas! how momentary was the bli&s;s!&mdash;the evane&s;cent vi&s;ion &s;oon fled, and the youthful queen was arrayed in the melancholy garb of widowhood! From this moment &s;he &s;eems marked the daughter of &s;orrow. The death of her mother rendered her return to Scotland indi&s;pen&s;able; and, with an aching heart, &s;he prepared to obey the dictates of duty. Is there, who &s;hudders not, as &s;he receives, while yet in France, the homage of the contending parties? Gladly would we remove her from the toils and tumults of a turbulent admini&s;tration, and &s;helter her amid tho&s;e &s;o|cial haunts which &s;he would dignify and adorn. Yet, con&s;cious of integrity, and with a heart glowing with the benevolent purpo&s;e of appea&s;ing conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, de&s;troying animo&s;ities, and healing every breach, &s;he prepared for her voyage to her hereditary dominions.</P>
<P>Although zealou&s;ly attached to the religion in which &s;he had been educated, and which was the election of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">per years, yielding, neverthele&s;s, to the popular current, &s;he judiciou&s;ly placed her confidence in tho&s;e lords, who were <HI>avowedly in the Prote&s;tant</HI> intere&s;t; and it appears that all her plans were conciliatory. What a va&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of care in&s;tantly devolved upon her, and what a fearful conflict awaited!!!</P>
<P>Elizabeth&mdash;the powerful Elizabeth, nearly allied to her in blood, but the determined foe of her virtues and her preten&s;ions, was irreconcileably offended by the early declaration which had been made of her right to the crown of England; and her inveteracy was apparent in almo&s;t every action; but the firmne&s;s and penetration of Mary was fully equal to every <HI>open</HI> and

<HI>avowed</HI> attack; and it was only to the &s;tudied artifice of di&s;&s;imulation, that &s;he became a victim. Her an&s;wer to Throgmorton, while &s;he continued in Paris, relative to the treaty, binding her to ab&s;tain <HI>forever</HI> from a&s;&s;uming the title and arms of England, was at once de&s;criptive of her wi&s;dom and her addre&s;s, and con|firmed the favourable ideas which were entertained of her character.</P>
<P>Elizabeth commenced ho&s;tilities by denying Mary a &s;afe conduct to her dominions; and the remarks of the Scotti&s;h prince&s;s on this occa&s;ion were &s;pirited and proper. Taking leave of the royal family of France, at St. Germains, &s;he proceeded to Calais, where &s;he embarked for Scotland. And, connecting the deplo|rable circum&s;tances of her life with its tragical cata&s;|trophe, our &s;en&s;ibilities are rou&s;ed almo&s;t to agony, as we witne&s;s her departure from a &s;cene which had naturally engaged her fonde&s;t partialities. The in|fantile joys, the &s;oft indulgence, and fo&s;tering care, which hovered round her morn of life, the felicity and dignity of her wedded days, pa&s;&s;ed in review before her, and her regrets were proportioned to the plea&s;ures &s;he had experienced&mdash;we acknowledge their propriety&mdash;we mark the deepening angui&s;h impre&s;&s;ed upon ev|ery feature&mdash;we hear her exclaim, as the Gallic &s;hores recede from her gaze, "<HI>Farewel, France! Farewel, delightful country! I leave thee, never to return!</HI>" We li&s;ten to the tender iteration; her perturbed &s;ighs vi|brate upon our ears; the intervening &s;hades of night officiou&s;ly obtrude; and, with the lovely mourner, we watch the returning dawn; eagerly we catch a parting look, and we &s;eem to inmingle our &s;treaming tears with tho&s;e of the royal &s;ufferer. Yet we ble&s;s the enveloping mi&s;t which &s;heltered her from the em|i&s;&s;aries of the inho&s;pitable Elizabeth; and when we behold her in her native dominions, amid the acclama|tions of her gratulating &s;ubjects, we become &s;olicitous to deceive our&s;elves, and we would fain di&s;per&s;e, in the&s;e happy pre&s;agements, the deep gloom which a knowl|edge of &s;ucceeding events hath thrown about the heart.</P>

For a time, the tendere&s;t con&s;iderations gave to the beauteous queen, in the bo&s;om of manhood, an affect|ing intere&s;t!

But Mary, although &s;urrounded by in|veterate foes, who were variou&s;ly intere&s;ted in her de|&s;truction, borne forward on the &s;tream of innocence, and fanned by the gales of con&s;cious rectitude, pur&s;u|ed her &s;teady and equal cour&s;e. Strange, that to a conduct not only <HI>unexceptionable,</HI> but highly <HI>meritorious,</HI> the profe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>mild and peaceable doctrines of chri&s;|tianity</HI> &s;hould unnaturally oppo&s;e them&s;elves, <HI>incon&s;i&s;t|ently</HI> taking rank with the mo&s;t determined of the queen's enemies! Open, generous, inexperienced and confiding, &s;he embarked again&s;t ignorance, bigotry, perfidy and the mo&s;t ferocious cruelty; and, in a con|te&s;t &s;o unequal, it cannot be matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, that &s;he ultimately became the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Many &s;ources of inquietude combined; parties were daily more and more exa&s;perated; the age was infi|nitely profligate; and events, truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, which human efforts could neither fore&s;ee nor prevent, were almo&s;t hourly &s;ucceeding. The queen, &s;uperior to partiality, referred offenders to a court of law, and only interfered by extending her royal clemency, as of|ten as the &s;afety of her &s;ubjects and her per&s;onal &s;ecu|rity would admit. The animo&s;ities of the di&s;affected nobles filled her with the deepe&s;t regret; whatever party prevailed, joy was a &s;tranger to her bo&s;om; the &s;ympathies which &s;he experienced for the &s;ufferers, barred the entrance of plea&s;ure; and her mind, accu&s;|tomed to the refinements of &s;cience and of rea&s;on, the abode of the virtues and the graces, was now, by &s;tern nece&s;&s;ity, &s;urrendered up a prey to anxiety, perturba|tion, and a ho&s;t of fearful apprehen&s;ions. In a &s;itua|tion thus cruelly embarra&s;&s;ed, &s;he became &s;till more &s;olicitous to &s;ecure the amity of the Engli&s;h queen. Negociations for an interview were opened, and on her part, every advance, con&s;i&s;tent with regal dignity, was cheerfully and &s;incerely made. But hatred is a dead|ly poi&s;on, and no emollients can arre&s;t its progre&s;s.

The nefarious duplicity of Elizabeth was triumphant; and after the place and time of their meeting was ap|pointed, &s;he had the addre&s;s to delay, and finally en|tirely to &s;et a&s;ide this de&s;irable event!</P>
<P>Without a friend&mdash;de&s;titute of a protector&mdash;no guar|dian hand to point the better way, we &s;pontaneou&s;ly lament the fate of a woman &s;o young, and &s;o environed by danger. The daring attempt of Chatelard was a &s;pecimen of the evils to which &s;he was &s;ubjected; but his &s;ucceeding puni&s;hment &s;hould entirely free her from the &s;hadow of &s;u&s;picion. Propo&s;als of marriage were made her by many crowned heads: while the cla&s;hing intere&s;ts of contending parties, and their con&s;equent intrigues, &s;eemed an in&s;uperable bar to a conjugal en|gagement. Elizabeth, oppo&s;ed in every po&s;&s;ible &s;itu|ation to the advancement of Mary, even <HI>exceeded her|&s;elf in adroitne&s;s of fine&s;&s;e,</HI> relative to her marriage. She was indefatigable in rai&s;ing ob&s;tacles thereto; and &s;he dictated, remon&s;trated and objected, in a &s;tyle &s;o imperious, that if the Queen of Scots had not po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed unequalled di&s;cretion, would have procured an utter dereliction of her conciliatory views; but her rever&s;ionary expectations, relative to the crown of England, &s;till kept her true to her &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is of affairs, the feminine heart will con|fe&s;s a high degree of exultation, at the view of Mary taking her &s;eat in the great council of the nation. See! &s;he looks, &s;he moves a queen. She is &s;olicitous to imprint upon the public mind the mo&s;t favourable impre&s;&s;ions: All the dignity of maje&s;ty is blended with the mo&s;t benign demon&s;trations of complacency.

It was at this juncture that the Prote&s;tant preachers renewed their clamours; the improvements originat|ing with the queen, were made to a&s;&s;ume the hue of criminality; and even the ornaments of her per&s;on became the &s;ubject of their inflammatory declamations. With that &s;evere reformer, Knox, Mary conde&s;cended to expo&s;tulate: He had laboured to procure the con|demnation of the adherents of the ma&s;s! What dete&s;t|able in&s;olence! How cruelly incon&s;i&s;tent would he have rendered the admini&s;tration of his &s;overeign! and how in&s;ulting were the importunities which directed her <HI>to execute</HI> per&s;ons for tho&s;e religious ob&s;ervances, <HI>which &s;he her&s;elf practi&s;ed,</HI> and from which &s;he derived her mo&s;t &s;olid enjoyments! Mary repre&s;ented to Knox the <HI>inclemency of intoleration, and the horrid barbarity of devoting men to death, merely for an opinion.</HI> It is diffi|cult to conceive of words or ideas more &s;hockingly gro&s;s, than tho&s;e which con&s;tituted his indecent replies. <HI>Samuel hewing Agag to pieces; Jezebel's fal&s;e prophets, and Baal's prie&s;ts</HI>&mdash;the&s;e were brutally held up to view, until <Q><HI>Mary, fall of a&s;toni&s;hment at the boundle&s;s audac|ity of the man, and too &s;en&s;ible of the in&s;ulting freedom of his &s;peech,</HI> bur&s;t into tears!</Q> But the zealot per&s;i&s;ted to ju&s;tify his conduct, and &s;he commanded him to depart from her pre&s;ence. Viewing the Queen of Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> as con&s;cientiou&s;ly attached to the religion of her ance&s;|tors, we cannot but admire the continued moderation with which &s;he replied to tho&s;e rude requi&s;itions, that finally in&s;i&s;ted on an utter abjuration of her hereditary faith!

<P>The queen endeavoured to excite the officers, in their different departments, to a performance of their re&s;pec|tive duties, by an augmentation of &s;alaries.

&s;he was laudably ambitious of fame. May the ble&s;|&s;ing of Heaven re&s;t upon that hi&s;torian, who hath, at this late period, renewed tho&s;e laurels, which, plucked by the rude hand of prejudice and &s;uper&s;tition, might el&s;e no more have wreathed the brow of &s;o meritorious a candidate for excellence.</P>
<P>The revolt of the Earl of Murray was attended with circum&s;tances of aggravated atrocity; but was never|thele&s;s excited and abetted by Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Mary at length effectuated her marriage with Lord Darnley. The exterior of this nobleman was prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing, his addre&s;s captivating, and the queen was tenderly attached to him. It was not a connexion calculated to excite the jealou&s;y of Elizabeth; it was <HI>primarily concerted by her&s;elf;</HI> yet it con&s;i&s;ted with her in&s;idious policy to <HI>affect di&s;plea&s;ure;</HI> and, po&s;&s;ibly, <HI>the few halcyon</HI> days allowed to Mary, might be to Eliza|beth a &s;ubject of &s;erious regret.</P>
<P>At this period, the majority of the Scotch pre&s;erved their loyalty, and the people in general entertained proper &s;entiments of the di&s;&s;imulation and intrigues of Elizabeth. The fe&s;tivity, con&s;equent upon the royal nuptials, gave place to ho&s;tile preparations! The queen, at the head of a formidable army, appeared in the field; the Earl of Murray and his adherents were put to flight, and immediately took refuge in England; while Elizabeth, with her accu&s;tomed duplicity, &s;ecret|ly patronized, and o&s;ten&s;ibly condemned them. Mary, having thus conducted to an honourable i&s;&s;ue an in|&s;urrection &s;ufficiently alarming, might have ta&s;ted the &s;weets of dome&s;tic peace and tender amity, had &s;he not been written in the book of fate, irrever&s;ibly un|fortunate.</P>
<P>Darnley po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mind incapable of a refined at|tachment. His capacity was below a mediocrity! Tho&s;e &s;uperficial accompli&s;hments, which captivate at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;oon lo&s;e their effect; and Darnley, alas! could not command e&s;teem! He was arrogant, haugh|ty and jealous; no entreaties could &s;ubdue his ob&s;tina|cy; and he was at once incon&s;tant and inflexible, rude
<PB N="145" REF="034162_0491_0FFC6D0FA36B65E8">
and contemptible. In &s;hort, the queen too late di&s;cov|ered a melancholy truth; and painful experience con|vinced her that &s;he had made a mo&s;t unworthy election! But although love, &s;preading its downy pinions, fled from the bo&s;om of Mary, (and it is too certain that its place was not &s;upplied by e&s;teem) yet <HI>virtue,</HI> regent in her brea&s;t, continued the bulwark of her honour. A &s;en&s;e of duty took the lead, and kept her &s;teady in the path of rectitude. It is true, &s;he wept the precipitancy of that &s;tep which had decided her fate; but, notwith|&s;tanding Lord Darnley's coldne&s;s, and unmerited neglect, although inconte&s;tible proofs of his infidelity were frequently furni&s;hed, yet &s;he &s;till remembered that he was her hu&s;band, and failed not to con&s;ider what was due to her own character, as a wife and a queen.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ition that Mary was improperly attach|ed to Rizzio, could only have originated in the dark bo&s;om of prejudice, heated by bigotry, and &s;timulated by the extreme&s;t rancour. Rizzio was old, ugly and mis&s;hapen&mdash;and "it is a wild ab&s;urdity to imagine that the queen would &s;ubmit to the care&s;&s;es of de|formity and old age." His a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in her pre&s;|ence, at a time when her intere&s;ting &s;ituation ought to have engaged the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s of her hu&s;band, (e&s;pecially when her high dignity and &s;uperior accom|pli&s;hments are remembered) was indeed a barbarous outrage, and mu&s;t &s;hock even the mo&s;t phlegmatic feelings of humanity. The &s;ub&s;equent treatment of the queen; the drawn dagger, pointed at her bo&s;om; the tremendous threats which were &s;ounded in her ears; her impri&s;onment, and the audacious reproaches to which &s;he was &s;ubjected; the attempt to infix upon her un&s;ullied honour an indelible &s;tain; and all the&s;e atrocities pa&s;&s;ing under the eye, and &s;anctioned by the man on whom &s;he had conferred the highe&s;t honours, and even rai&s;ed to a throne&mdash;the&s;e aggravating circum|&s;tances rank this black tran&s;action, when con&s;idered in all its parts, among the mo&s;t horrid and enormous crimes which were perpetrated in tho&s;e days of tur|pitude and murder. Yet even the&s;e deep tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="146" REF="034162_0492_0FFC6D0E1FB7EB38">
a di&s;po&s;ition &s;uperior to malignity, enabled the queen to forgive&mdash;&s;he con&s;ented to a reconciliation with the king&mdash;&s;he approbated an act of amne&s;ty&mdash;&s;he remitted the offences of the delinquent Murray, who again &s;ought his own emolument in a re&s;toration to her favour&mdash;and ob&s;erving, with an air of dignity, that &s;he utterly dete&s;ted every &s;pecies of inhumanity, &s;he nobly &s;anctioned the act of oblivion.</P>
<P>While the barbed &s;hafts of misfortune were thus piercing the bo&s;om of the Queen of Scots, a white moment was however at hand; and when &s;he u&s;hered into being her fir&s;t-born &s;on, &s;he in that in&s;tant forgot all tho&s;e &s;orrows which, with &s;uch accumulating weight, had pre&s;&s;ed upon her. The birth of the roy|al infant was celebrated in Scotland by every po&s;&s;ible demon&s;tration of joy&mdash;while Elizabeth mourned this event, as a &s;erious calamity! Alas! alas! how do the virtues fade in that bo&s;om, into which the deform|ing fiends, <HI>jealou&s;y</HI> and <HI>envy,</HI> have made their de&s;o|lating entrance!</P>
<P>At this period, we are again con&s;trained to regret the uniform unworthine&s;s of the king, and his total deficiency in all tho&s;e qualities inherent in a noble mind. But his haughtine&s;s was &s;till un&s;ubdued! Yet, through all the deepening glooms which he &s;o injudi|ciou&s;ly a&s;&s;umed, through all his ungrateful returns to the tenderne&s;s of the queen, even to the hour of his melancholy exit, we trace, on her part, a uniform ex|emplification of prudence and virtue; and we repeat, that the precepts of religion, together with an exqui|&s;ite &s;en&s;e of the delicacy of her &s;ituation, and the con|&s;ideration &s;he owed to virtue and to her&s;elf, was, in her bo&s;om, an effectual &s;ub&s;titute for that affection which the demerits of the king had bani&s;hed from thence!&mdash;To-morrow, my dear, we will pur&s;ue this in|tere&s;ting &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>MARY, utterly aver&s;e to the departure of the king, oppo&s;ed it by every proper method; and her conde&s;cen&s;ion, upon this occa&s;ion, was truly amiable, truly feminine. But his peevi&s;hne&s;s and his ob&s;tinacy remained invincible, and it was in tho&s;e in|tere&s;ting moments that he conceived the ungrateful de&s;ign of dive&s;ting Mary of that &s;overeignty to which &s;he was born&mdash;of placing the crown upon the head of his infant &s;on, and of a&s;&s;uming, as his father, that au|thority he was &s;o ill qualified to maintain. Yet the queen, although apprized of the&s;e proceedings, per&s;e|vered in the mild &s;y&s;tem &s;he had adopted; and, while her hours of retirement were devoted to &s;orrow, &s;he continued in public, to di&s;gui&s;e her grief by an a&s;&s;um|ed gaiety; and her elegance, urbanity and native dignity, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her favour all tho&s;e with whom &s;he a&s;&s;ociated.</P>
<P>The perturbed &s;ituation of her mind brought on, however, a dangerous illne&s;s: It was apprehended her la&s;t moments were at hand: and &s;he yielded her&s;elf, with holy re&s;ignation, to her fate. The king contin|ued unmoved, nor deigned, even at the moment when her death was pronounced inevitable, to make her a &s;ingle vi&s;it. But &s;he was re&s;tored to health; and in the &s;ucceeding indi&s;po&s;ition of the king, &s;he exhibited a rever&s;e of conduct, which reflects the highe&s;t honour upon her principles and her humanity. Uninfluenced by the remon&s;trances of tho&s;e who eagerly &s;olicited her to procure a divorce, her hu&s;band's danger awakened the tendere&s;t &s;ympathies of her generous bo&s;om, and &s;he cea&s;ed, in the calamity of the moment, to remem|ber her manifold injuries! Days and months had re|volved,
<PB N="148" REF="034162_0494_0FFC6D0679F56318">
and their lenient influence had blunted her keen &s;en&s;e of the wrongs &s;he had received. She was by nature placable; her anger re&s;embled the pa&s;&s;ing cloud, which, for an in&s;tant, intercepts the mildly beam|ing radiance of day; and while her &s;treaming eyes evinced her grief, no vindictive pa&s;&s;ion harboured in her bo&s;om! Her tender melancholy paved the way to the renewal of her affection, and every &s;en&s;e of di&s;obli|gation, every idea of his inferiority, like the vi&s;ion of &s;ome dark and comfortle&s;s night, in&s;tantly vani&s;hed away. The king too, placed, in his own apprehen|&s;ion, on the verge of di&s;&s;olution, experienced the &s;aluta|ry &s;en&s;ations of remor&s;e; and he reproached him&s;elf, in the bittere&s;t terms, for his ingratitude to the queen. The news of his relenting was expeditiou&s;ly conveyed to her; and all that impa&s;&s;ioned tenderne&s;s he had originated in her bo&s;om, ru&s;hed upon her memory&mdash;the felicities of wedded amity&mdash;the hour, which in the bloom of youth, and the full perfection of her per&s;onal charms, devoted her to Darnley&mdash;the lovely infant whom &s;he hourly pre&s;&s;ed to her bo&s;om&mdash;the&s;e inter|e&s;ting con&s;iderations obtained in her mind their due weight; and, quitting her palace in the depth of he wintry months, &s;he ha&s;tened to attend him; with af|fectionate a&s;&s;iduity &s;he hovered round his bed of lan|gui&s;hment, and her pre&s;ence, and her endearments op|erated as the &s;weete&s;t &s;olace; the mind of the king became tranquil, and health again glowed in his veins. He accompanied the queen to Edinburgh, and her demon&s;trations of fond &s;olicitude were unwearied.</P>
<P>It was at this juncture, that the nobles, who, by an aggravated repre&s;entation of the king's offences, had cheri&s;hed the re&s;entments of the queen, apprehen&s;ive that the con&s;equences of the reconciliation between the royal pair would be de&s;tructive to them&s;elves, contriv|ed and perpetrated the murder of the king! The &s;uppo&s;ition that Mary was acce&s;&s;ary, con&s;enting, or even privy thereto, is devoid even of the &s;hadow of probability; It was forged in the dark haunts of igno|rance and credulity; and it is confuted by a circum|&s;tantial
<PB N="149" REF="034162_0495_0FFC6D04F50B21D0">
&s;eries of well atte&s;ted facts&mdash;by the mildne&s;s, moderation, tender &s;ympathy, and genuine piety, which were con&s;picuous traits in the character of the queen&mdash;by the te&s;timony of many who endured the extreme&s;t torture&mdash;by the dying a&s;&s;everations of all tho&s;e who were executed for this crime&mdash;and by the declaration of Bothwell, who, having dragged out a number of years in clo&s;e impri&s;onment, in his la&s;t moments made a complete confe&s;&s;ion of his own guilt and her innocence. The angui&s;h, horror and con&s;ternation of the queen&punc; at the fatal intelligence, were equal to the enormity of the crime which had been perpetrated; and &s;he affirm|ed, that if her kingdom and her life were the forfeit, all tho&s;e who had procured a cata&s;trophe &s;o &s;hocking, &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted to the death. She called on her a&s;&s;embled nobles to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in her ju&s;t purpo&s;e, of delivering up to condign puni&s;hment, offenders &s;o atrocious; and, with &s;treaming eyes and heart-affect|ing earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;he conjured them to leave no means une&s;&s;ayed, which might involve the remote&s;t probabil|ity of a &s;urrender &s;o important. She pathetically la|mented, that in a moment, when the &s;unny beams of hope had revi&s;ited her bo&s;om, when the clouds, which gathered round her pro&s;pects, had began to di&s;per&s;e, and the &s;erene plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic life were opening to her view, &s;he &s;hould thus fatally, by the audacious hand of guilt, be overwhelmed in &s;orrow, and con&s;ign|ed over, the haple&s;s victim of a tran&s;action, dark, une|qualled, and tremendous!</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances attendant upon the king's death, were &s;ufficient to enkindle in the bo&s;om of humanity the keene&s;t regret: and to this cau&s;e the extreme de|jection of Mary is to be attributed. The mo&s;t af|fectionate and meritorious of men could not have been lamented with more unequivocal demon&s;trations of grief. Immured in the deep rece&s;&s;es of her ca&s;tle, &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf to the mo&s;t lively &s;orrow: her apartments were hung with black; the light of the &s;un was excluded; and the faintly burning taper but &s;erved to mark the glooms which hovered round her.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="034162_0496_0FFC6D0370784788">
But emerging at length, from this extreme of grief, &s;he adopted the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures for appre|hending the regicides. Many circum&s;tances produced in her mind a per&s;ua&s;ion, that the con&s;pirators had aimed at involving her in the king's death, and her orders for the pro&s;ecution were unequivocal and ab|&s;olute. The &s;um of two thou&s;and pounds, together with an annuity for life, was tendered to any individ|ual who &s;hould give information of the perpetrators of this horrid tran&s;action; and this large&s;s, with the addition of a free amne&s;ty, was proffered to the con|&s;pirator, who &s;hould make an unre&s;erved di&s;clo&s;ure of his own guilt and that of his accomplices. In con&s;e|quence of this proclamation, placards were affixed in various public places, accu&s;ing the Earl of Bothwell, and others, as the murderers; but as tho&s;e papers and placards in&s;inuated, that <HI>the queen her&s;elf had been a party concerned,</HI> &s;he very ju&s;tly e&s;timated their innocence by her own. Bothwell, &s;olemnly atte&s;ting his integri|ty, loudly demanded a trial, and he inveighed bitterly again&s;t his calumniators; no po&s;itive proofs were ad|duced of his guilt; the Earl of Lennox alone appeared again&s;t him, and not a &s;ingle witne&s;s to corroborate the charge was produced. The queen's council <HI>affect|ed</HI> to con&s;ider Bothwell as the &s;ubject of rancorous malice; the <HI>principal nobility warmly e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e,</HI> and they charged the Earl of Lennox with acting un|der the influence of the mo&s;t ignoble pa&s;&s;ions. The queen had frequently remarked that Lennox was &s;u&s;|picious, revengeful and pa&s;&s;ionate. The defamation, in &s;uch general circulation, might probably re&s;ult from his arrangements; and be&s;ides, the impre&s;&s;ion that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in was armed again&s;t her own life al&s;o, being indelibly infixed upon her mind, a de&s;ign &s;o atrocious, with re&s;pect to her, could not con&s;i&s;t with the unbroken fealty, and uniform homage, which the conduct of the Earl of Bothwell had invariably exem|plified. Bothwell was, however, brought to a public trial, and the jury acquitted him of all &s;hare in the king's murder! I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this judgment is an evidence of
<PB N="151" REF="034162_0497_0FFC6D00F92136B0">
their criminality; if it is viewed as a mockery of law and ju&s;tice, however ignominious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> may be deemed, it cannot arraign the conduct of the queen; nor can &s;he, by any rational con&s;truction, be involved in its guilt. Circum&s;tances, relative to the criminality of Bothwell, which have &s;ince tran&s;pired, were then en|veloped in my&s;tery; yet, that there exi&s;ted pre&s;ump|tive proofs, &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the &s;tronge&s;t &s;u&s;picions, cannot be denied; and, moreover, his licentious habits forcibly pointed the public odium.</P>
<P>The queen remained in entire ignorance of the de|&s;igns formed upon her by Bothwell; his behaviour indicated, in her apprehen&s;ion, nothing more than that re&s;pectful attachment which was due to his &s;overeign; &s;he was grateful for his zealous exertions to promote her intere&s;t; &s;he regarded him as a man of talents; and &s;he allowed him that con&s;ideration, which &s;he conceiv|ed due to his abilities. Her unprincipled nobles, however, indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;eeking her ruin, agreed, amid the tumultuous riot of a banquet, to point out this man of crimes as a proper per&s;on to become the hu&s;band of their &s;overeign! and they ratified a deed, in which they extolled the integrity of Bothwell, the antiquity of his lineage, and the e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices he had render|ed the &s;tate. They expatiated upon his trial for the murder of the king, upon his &s;ub&s;equent offer to meet his accu&s;er in &s;ingle combat, affirming them to amount to a perfect ju&s;tification of his innocence; and they declared them&s;elves fully convinced of his integrity.</P>
<P>Bothwell was now in the preci&s;e &s;ituation at which his audacious wi&s;hes had long pointed. His &s;ub&s;e|quent &s;eizure of the queen was the fini&s;hing &s;troke, and fully completed his nefarious climax of villany. Mary's infinite a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;o daring an act of pre|meditated violence, from a man who&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive man|ners had given her the highe&s;t idea of his re&s;pectful fidelity, and the bitterne&s;s and indignation which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, corre&s;ponded exactly with the whole tenor of her preceding life. Her re&s;entment was the re&s;ent|ment of outraged virtue, and her reproaches character|ized

<P>Hitherto we have contemplated Mary as an orna|ment to humanity.

<P>HUMANITY, my dear girl, mu&s;t lament Eliza|beth's depraved politics, as they related to the Queen of Scots. Whatever que&s;tion involved the intere&s;ts of Mary, &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of rou&s;|ing to action the mo&s;t nefarious propen&s;ities&mdash;of nar|rowing her views, and of yielding her up to the do|minion of envy, jealou&s;y and every ignoble pa&s;&s;ion!

and un&s;u&s;pecting nature, by &s;eeking &s;helter in her kingdom; by electing her the arbitre&s;s of her fate, and committing her deare&s;t intere&s;ts to her deci&s;ion&mdash;Elizabeth was then furni&s;hed with a mo&s;t de&s;irable opportunity of era&s;ing from the annals of her admin|i&s;tration, every deforming trait; of removing the odium which re&s;ted upon her tran&s;actions relative to her royal kin&s;woman; and of in&s;uring to her&s;elf the unbounded applau&s;e and veneration of po&s;terity. Her unfortunate rival was &s;ufficiently humbled; and by the indi&s;&s;oluble ties of love and gratitude, &s;he might have bound the gentle and affectionate Mary forever to her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Elizabeth, in her own dominions, was nearly de&s;|potic; &s;he maintained an a&s;cendency in the Scotti&s;h councils: It would have been ea&s;y for her to rein&s;tate the Queen of Scots upon her throne; and &s;uch a pro|cedure would have been princely, it would have been great, and nobly worthy the combined claims of &s;ex, of kindred, of misfortune, and of Queen&s;hip! It would have been an action &s;uited to the maje&s;ty of the &s;overeign of a powerful and gallant nation. But if Elizabeth could not &s;oar &s;o high, had &s;he marked the arrival of Mary by tho&s;e tender offices of friend&s;hip which are the balm of life&mdash;had &s;he received her as her gue&s;t, yielding her tho&s;e honours which were due to her rank&mdash;had &s;he exerci&s;ed her authority and in|fluence to render her &s;ituation eligible&mdash;had &s;he indul|ged the lovely mourner with tho&s;e intercour&s;es of amity, which in every period of her life were &s;o com|pletely in uni&s;on with her feelings&mdash;the &s;orrows of her heart had been a&s;&s;uaged; we &s;hould have regarded Elizabeth with complacency, and &s;ought for the mo|tives of her limited kindne&s;s, in that policy, to the ob|&s;ervance of which, the exigencies of &s;tate may fre|quently condemn the philanthropic mind.</P>
<P>But the conduct of Elizabeth was un&s;exual, unju&s;t, and infinitely cruel. The de&s;olate queen, rudely de|nied admi&s;&s;ion to her pre&s;ence, was condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment; and Elizabeth, while &s;he was

Yet the queen of England had care&s;&s;ed the Scotti&s;h nobles, when deformed by ingratitude, and recent from the haunts of rebellion! who&s;e hands were imbrued in blood, and on who&s;e lives were infixed the deepening &s;tain of guilt!</P>
<P>Mary, in the angui&s;h of her &s;pirit, &s;olicited for an interview&mdash;con&s;cious of her innocence, &s;he only wi&s;hed to be heard; but, alas! no &s;ympathy pervaded the bo&s;om of Elizabeth&mdash;&s;he triumphed in the misfortunes which &s;he was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed in accumulating; and that dignified arrangement which would have re&s;tored an outraged and an afflicted queen to the ample and unalienated po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her hereditary honours and prerogatives, found no place in her delib|erations! Pity &s;he could not have known that by acting the part of a &s;i&s;ter and a queen, &s;he might have en|wreathed her brow with a garland, the perfume of which would have been immortal; but &s;he cho&s;e to proceed in the crooked path &s;he had &s;o perver&s;ely entered.</P>
<P>The Earl of Murray was encouraged to accu&s;e his &s;overeign before the Engli&s;h queen, while Mary &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed at the pre&s;umption of that prince&s;s, who interpreted her wi&s;h to narrate in a per&s;onal interview her misfortunes, and to exculpate her&s;elf from the calumnies of her rancorous foes, into a de&s;ire of a public trial, and a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her juri&s;diction! What heart but bleeds at the peru&s;al of a letter ad|dre&s;&s;ed by the Scotti&s;h prince&s;s to the malevolent Elizabeth.</P>

<P>How pathetically intere&s;ting, how mode&s;tly digni|fied, and how characteri&s;tic of the amiable writer. But Elizabeth remained unmoved; the enemies of Mary were in&s;pirited, &s;anctioned and patronized, while the interpo&s;ition of her friends was wholly di&s;regard|ed. Commi&s;&s;ioners for the trial were appointed, and they were directed by Elizabeth to proceed in &s;uch a manner, as to infix upon the reputation of the Queen

Yet in the cour&s;e of their inve&s;tigation, inconte&s;tible proofs of her honour pre&s;&s;|ed upon them, and they could not but commi&s;erate a prince&s;s &s;o unfortunate.

Tremendous was the cri&s;is &s;he had obtained&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ick darkne&s;s over&s;hadowed her&mdash;of crimes of the deepe&s;t dye &s;he was accu&s;ed, and <HI>pretended proofs</HI> were on the point of being produced! Had &s;he been <HI>con&s;cious of guilt, &s;he would have &s;hrunk from the ordeal,</HI> but &s;he <HI>im|plored</HI> and <HI>demanded</HI> permi&s;&s;ion to confront her adver|&s;aries; and this <HI>privilege,</HI> this <HI>important reque&s;t,</HI> this <HI>right,</HI> was barbarou&s;ly denied her! The artifice and duplicity of Elizabeth &s;ucceeded but too well; for al|though no formal decree was obtained, yet upon the credit of papers proved (by <HI>internal conviction, and a &s;e|ries of inconte&s;tible facts,</HI>) atrocious forgeries, an attempt was made to &s;tamp upon the public mind a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion of Mary's guilt. Mary in&s;i&s;ted that the determination of a cau&s;e which had obtained &s;uch gen|eral attention, ought to be a verdict of guilt or inno|cence; and with agonized earne&s;tne&s;s &s;he &s;till pre&s;&s;ed to be heard; nor can her unyielding, intrepid, and proper remon&s;trances, be under&s;tood in any other view than as corroborating proofs of her integrity.</P>
<P>Elizabeth's final determination not to admit the pleadings of Mary, is agreeable to the whole tenor of her behaviour to her royal pri&s;oner; and having ban|i&s;hed all compunction from her bo&s;om, &s;he dreaded to appear before that innocence &s;he had con&s;igned to de|&s;truction. <Q>She was &s;en&s;ible of the eloquence, the high &s;pirit, and the addre&s;s of Mary; and while &s;he trembled to oppo&s;e her&s;elf to the&s;e, &s;he apprehended, as more terrible in &s;o illu&s;trious an a&s;&s;embly, the in|tere&s;t

of di&s;tre&s;s, the dignity of unmerited misfor|tunes, and the pride of injured integrity. She was alarmed with guilty terrors; the image of a hated rival in the moment of victory haunted her; and her di&s;turbed imagination painted the lofty de|meanour of the Queen of Scots&mdash;her indignant emo|tions, and the lightning of her eye. She could not think of con&s;enting to a mea&s;ure, where &s;he had ev|ery thing to lo&s;e, and nothing to gain; and &s;he was too wi&s;e to exhibit her&s;elf an open and dete&s;table monument of &s;pleen, di&s;appointment, perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, rival&s;hip, jealou&s;y and anger.</Q></P>
<P>Thus did Elizabeth &s;acrifice true glory to her pa&s;|&s;ions. Had the Queen of Scots been le&s;s beautiful, le&s;s accompli&s;hed, and le&s;s meritorious, &s;he had not become the victim of hatred and perfidy. When it is remembered that the ingrates who appeared to ac|cu&s;e their &s;overeign, ab&s;olutely &s;tood charged by the Earls Huntley and Argyle, as the abettors of the king's death, and that the expectation of the formal pre&s;entment of the prote&s;tation of the two Lords, ac|celerated the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the murderers from the court of Elizabeth, it will excite equally our a&s;toni&s;h|ment and our indignation; and humanity will blu&s;h at a tran&s;action, which perhaps has not a parallel in the annals of hi&s;tory!</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of tho&s;e dark clouds in which Eliza|beth was &s;eeking to envelope the Scotti&s;h prince&s;s, her beauty and various accompli&s;hments made upon the duke of Norfolk an indelible impre&s;&s;ion; and, con|vinced of her innocence and her integrity, he &s;ought with impa&s;&s;ioned ardour to obtain her hand in mar|riage; but to indulge Mary with the &s;oothings of am|ity, would have been a mitigation of her fate, that came not within the plans of Elizabeth; and at the moment when the mutual e&s;teem of this illu&s;trious and amiable pair had ameliorated into the tendere&s;t love, the attachment of the duke of Norfolk proved his ruin, and he lo&s;t his life upon the &s;caffold, while the innocent object of his preference was &s;ubjected to

fre&s;h indignities! At this period, to pronounce in the pre&s;ence of Elizabeth, the name of the Queen of Scots, was &s;ufficient to di&s;tort her countenance by all the fren|zy of pa&s;&s;ion; and the Earl of Huntington, intere&s;ted in procuring the death of Mary, was a&s;&s;ociated with her more humane keeper! he was ferocious, and un|feeling, and his commi&s;&s;ion authorized his inhuman &s;everities! her di&s;tre&s;&s;es were to Huntington matter of exultation&mdash;her favourite dome&s;tics were torn from her&mdash;the number of her &s;ervants were curtailed&mdash;the mo&s;t &s;crutinizing watch was &s;et upon her conduct&mdash;or|ders were i&s;&s;ued for intercepting and conveying to the queen of England, letters written in the confidence of tender friend&s;hip; and if her pri&s;on &s;hould be &s;urround|ed with a force adequate to her re&s;cue, Huntington had directions to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate her!!</P>
<P>The Earl of Murray renewed and continued his traitorous practices. He had covenanted with Eliza|beth to &s;urrender to her the &s;on of Mary, whom &s;he was &s;olicitous to involve in the ruin of his mother, and to receive from her the Queen of Scots, with full lib|erty to inflict upon her whatever indignities might &s;uit his wi&s;hes&mdash;when he was arre&s;ted by the dart of death. Nor do I wonder that my Margaretta &s;hed no tears at his exit. His talents, though exerci&s;ed in the mo&s;t criminal practices, were great; and the&s;e, with a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing exterior, opened his way to that dignity, of which he was eminently unworthy. Yet a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his death, Mary, pious and affectionate, lamented a brother, whom &s;he con&s;idered as launched into eternity under the pre&s;&s;ure of unparalleled guilt.</P>
<P>The enormities of which the Engli&s;h queen had been guilty to the Scotti&s;h prince&s;s, enkindled in the bo&s;oms of foreign princes the deepe&s;t re&s;entments; but their remon&s;trances &s;erved only to call into action the ad|dre&s;s and perfidious di&s;&s;imulation of Elizabeth! The death of Mary was only wanting to fill up the mea&s;ure of her wrongs; and although even her enemies, who witne&s;&s;ed her behaviour, declared that the <Q>candour, &s;incerity, and moderation, which &s;he di&s;played, were

Mary had flattered her&s;elf that when years &s;hould permit her &s;on to a&s;&s;ume the reins of government, and to act deci&s;ively, her &s;orrows, through his intervention, would know a period; and this maternal hope operated upon her grief worn mind, as the &s;weete&s;t &s;olace. But Elizabeth had been careful to implant in the mind of the prince the &s;eeds of di&s;tru&s;t and animo&s;ity again&s;t his royal parent; and while &s;he excited and countenanced the rebellion of his &s;ubjects, &s;he directed and awed his councils, and through her influence the embroidered garment which his moth|er, in the dreary &s;olitude of her pri&s;on had fini&s;hed for him, together with the jewels which &s;he had intend|ed as a memento of her affection, were returned, with indecent marks of di&s;re&s;pect!!</P>
<P>Elizabeth was pur&s;uing with the &s;on the &s;ame track which had produced the ruin of the mother; and <HI>forged</HI> letters were employed by her amba&s;&s;ador, Ran|dolph, for the purpo&s;e of depriving him of the confi|dant whom he loved.

<P>THE intelligence of the &s;eizure and impri&s;onment of her &s;on to which the intrigues of Elizabeth had largely contributed, was a fre&s;h &s;tab to the unfor|tunate queen; and from her letter to Elizabeth, produ|ced by this event, I cannot forbear a few extracts. <Q>I am informed from undoubted authority, that my &s;on has been &s;urpri&s;ed by rebels; and I am tortured with apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t he &s;hould be reduced to the peculiar infelicities of that &s;ituation under which I have &s;uffered &s;o long.</Q> After &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions de|&s;criptive of her ju&s;t indignation, &s;he adds&mdash;<Q>&s;ince equi|ty and right mu&s;t &s;toop to the tyranny of your &s;cep|tre, I &s;hall carry my appeal to the eternal God, <HI>who&s;e dominion is over all the princes of the earth.

from Lochlevin, and was about to give battle to my rebellious &s;ubjects, I di&s;patched to you, by ex|pre&s;s, the diamond which you &s;ent me, as a token of your love; and I craved your aid. I thought that what I had received as a pledge of your affections, would awaken them; and, when you be&s;towed it, I was not only flattered with large promi&s;es of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but you even bound your&s;elf by your royal word, that if I &s;hould betake my&s;elf to your domin|ions, you would advance to your frontiers and meet me in per&s;on. I fondly relied upon your honour; and, in my adver&s;ity, I took the re&s;olution to throw my&s;elf into your arms, and to commit to your pro|tection my diadem and my per&s;on. <HI>But I was rude|ly &s;topped upon my journey, encompa&s;&s;ed with guards, and confined in &s;trong places; and, from the fir&s;t moment of my captivity, to the pre&s;ent hour, I have endured afflic|tions more bitter and grievous than death it&s;elf. Twelve tedious months have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince all communication between my &s;on and me, either by letter or me&s;&s;engers, has been in|terrupted.

<P>James would gladly have a&s;&s;ociated with his mother in the government of Scotland; but Elizabeth nefari|ou&s;ly oppo&s;ed plans for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Mary, which &s;he her&s;elf, to an&s;wer a then pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, had originated. The rebels of Scotland boldly urged their claims upon Elizabeth, by affirming that they had lo&s;t the confidence of their &s;overeign, and their patrimonial inheritance in con&s;equence of their combinations in her favour! That Mary was eager to emancipate her|&s;elf from the tyranny and cruelty of Elizabeth, is be|yond a doubt. A queen, detained in pri&s;on, and bar|barou&s;ly treated, while her virulent adver&s;aries are permitted to ravage her native realm&mdash;A mother, &s;ep|arated, during twenty revolving years, from a &s;on, who&s;e opening mind &s;he had wi&s;hed to form, embraces with ardour, every propo&s;ition by which &s;he may hope to return to her dominions, be re&s;tored to the exerci&s;e of her royal prerogatives and to her maternal duties&mdash;The&s;e were the crimes of which Mary, during her cap|tivity, was a&s;&s;uredly guilty; and upon this foundation was rai&s;ed the &s;uper&s;tructure of that proce&s;s, which, procuring her death, terminated gloriou&s;ly for her&s;elf, and bla&s;ted with eternal infamy her malignant adver|&s;ary. The cruelties exerci&s;ed towards Mary in her pri&s;on, is an outrage to humanity; any in&s;tance of be|nevolence or pity, exhibited to the Scotti&s;h queen, was con&s;trued into a breach of fidelity to Elizabeth, and her flatterers became emulous in acts of cruelty; while a hope was entertained that the aggravated calamities to which the royal pri&s;oner was &s;ubjected, would pre|cipitate her upon &s;ome ra&s;h action, by which &s;he would become in reality a criminal. But her integrity re|mained inflexible; and her upright mind, nerved by con&s;cious innocence, engaged with ardour in the habits of piety; and, &s;upported by the con&s;olatory truths of religion, continued greatly &s;uperior to the dete&s;table
<PB N="169" REF="034162_0515_0FFC6CD2104563D8">
plots fabricated for her de&s;truction. Her adver&s;aries were enraged at the inefficacy of their diabolical ar|rangements; and, fru&s;trated in their mo&s;t &s;anguine purpo&s;es, Leice&s;ter, prime minion to Elizabeth, di&s;|patched a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to &s;eize, in the gloomy rece&s;&s;es of the pri&s;on, that life which had been &s;ubjected to &s;uch a &s;e|ries of calamities!</P>
<P>But here, even the virtues of tho&s;e hard-hearted &s;av|ages, Paulet and Drury, made a &s;tand! They &s;purned the emi&s;&s;aries of Leice&s;ter, and felt the degradation to which they were &s;ubjected. Yet, notwith&s;tanding they &s;topped &s;hort of death, they were in the exerci&s;e of the utmo&s;t rigour. Her apartments, but two in number, were poorly furni&s;hed; neither were they &s;ufficient to &s;hield her from the inclemencies of the weather; and, that they might inflict on her every &s;pecies of indigni|ty, they rendered her pri&s;on a receptacle for common offenders; confining in her view, a young man, whom, after much per&s;ecution, they deprived of life, without judge or jury! They were indu&s;trious in cutting off every avenue, which could po&s;&s;ibly become an inlet of plea&s;ure to the unoffending victim of their rigour. Through the medium of a &s;ervant, &s;he had indulged the benevolence of her nature, by a regular di&s;tribu|tion of charity among the &s;ons and daughters of want, who abode in the vicinity of Tutbury Ca&s;tle! And who but mu&s;t execrate that unequalled inhumanity, which, having di&s;covered, &s;ternly denied even this &s;oothing, alleviation of her unparalleled woes?</P>
<P>But Elizabeth had not yet attained the &s;ummit of her wi&s;hes; and, per&s;evering in her atrocious career, her ob&s;equious parliament gratified her by an un|precedented &s;tatute, which made <Q><HI>a &s;overeign and in|dependent prince&s;s an&s;werable for her conduct to the &s;ub|jects of another potentate!</HI></Q> Thus was the way open for the accompli&s;hment of that tragical cata&s;trophe, at which the &s;anguinary views of the Engli&s;h queen had &s;o long pointed; and it only remained to involve the Scotti&s;h prince&s;s in real or <HI>&s;uppo&s;itious</HI> guilt.

exqui&s;itely iniquitous were employed; nor was any temptation left une&s;&s;ayed, which might allure her in|to practices again&s;t the dignity and life of Elizabeth. Babington's con&s;piracy pre&s;ented a favourable occa|&s;ion, and every probable mea&s;ure was embraced to engage her therein; but her virtue and her di&s;cretion remaining inacce&s;&s;ible, was proof again&s;t every a&s;|&s;ault; and <HI>forgery</HI> became once more the <HI>dernier re&s;ort</HI> of her implacable foes! Letters were written for her, to which &s;he was an utter &s;tranger; and upon tho&s;e letters were founded her trial and &s;ub&s;equent execu|tion!! Her clo&s;et was rudely broken open, without her previous expectation of &s;uch an event, and her cabinets, borne to Elizabeth, were examined in her pre&s;ence; yet, amid the multiplicity of papers they contained, to the no &s;mall regret of her enemies, <HI>a criminating &s;yllable was not to be found!</HI> The magna|nimity and genuine dignity, with which Mary replied to the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to proceed again&s;t her, a&s;toni&s;hed and confounded even her mo&s;t deter|mined foes. "It is," &s;aid &s;he, with admirable com|po&s;ure, <Q>a matter altogether uncommon, that Eliza|beth &s;hould <HI>command me to &s;ubmit to a trial, as if I were her &s;ubject.</HI> I am an independent &s;overeign, and will not tarni&s;h, by any meanne&s;s, my high birth, the princes my predece&s;&s;ors, and my &s;on.

<P>The de&s;olate captive per&s;i&s;ted in denying the au|thority of the commi&s;&s;ioners, yet &s;he was aware that they would, notwith&s;tanding, proceed to her trial; and a &s;weet hope of obtaining that triumph, to which her integrity entitled her, induced this truly intere&s;ting &s;ufferer to wave for a moment her hereditary queen|&s;hip, and to appear before the tribunal of tho&s;e u&s;urp|ers,
<PB N="171" REF="034162_0517_0FFC6CCEDEB4FA28">
who were predetermined to condemn her. Dig|nity, mode&s;ty, maje&s;ty and innocence, were &s;trongly pourtrayed in the <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of her defence; and an attention thereto mu&s;t wring &s;ympathy from the colde&s;t heart that ever beat in a human bo&s;om. "The accu&s;ation," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>preferred to my preju|dice, is a mo&s;t dete&s;table calumny. I was not en|gaged with Babington in his con&s;piracy; and I am altogether innocent of having plotted the death of Elizabeth.</Q> After having produced irrefragable proofs of her integrity, &s;he adds&mdash;<Q>I will confe&s;s that I have yielded to the &s;trong impul&s;es of nature; and that like a human creature, encompa&s;&s;ed with dan|gers, I have exerted my&s;elf to recover my greatne&s;s and my liberty. The efforts I have made can ex|cite no blu&s;hes in me, for the voice of mankind mu&s;t applaud them. Religion, in her &s;terne&s;t moments of &s;everity, cannot look to them with reproach; and to con&s;ider them as crimes, is to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;anctimonious reverence of humanity, and to give way to the &s;u&s;picious wretchedne&s;s of de&s;poti&s;m. But the attainment of my kingdom, the recovering of my liberty, and the advancement of that religion which I love, could not induce me to &s;tain my&s;elf with the crimes which are objected to me. I would di&s;dain to purcha&s;e a crown by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the meane&s;t of the human race. To accu&s;e me of &s;cheming the death of the queen, my &s;i&s;ter, is to brand me with the infamy which I abhor mo&s;t. It is my nature to employ the devotion of E&s;ther, and not the &s;word of Judith. But amid&s;t the inclement and unprincipled preten&s;ions, which my adver&s;aries are plea&s;ed to invent, to overwhelm me with ca|lamities and angui&s;h, I can trace and di&s;cover the real cau&s;e of their ho&s;tility and pro&s;ecution. <HI>My crimes are, my birth, the injuries I have been compelled to endure, and my religion.

The &s;oul-affecting pleader evinced her exqui&s;ite &s;en|&s;ibility and deep &s;en&s;e of gratitude, when, during her trial, reference being made to the Earl of Arundel, with &s;treaming eyes &s;he pathetically uttered the mem|orable exclamation, which has been &s;o often cited: <Q><HI>Alas! alas! how much has the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Howard endured for me!</HI></Q> Beauteous and deeply wronged mourner! never was calamity more dignifi|ed, never was &s;orrow more ennobled!

<P>Mea&s;ures were taken to procure the con&s;ent of James to this violation of ho&s;pitality, decency, and nature! But the propo&s;al filled him with a&s;toni&s;hment, grief, indignation and remor&s;e. He &s;purned, with filial de|te&s;tation, every &s;ugge&s;tion upon this head, and ha&s;ten|ed to di&s;patch to Elizabeth the mo&s;t &s;pirited and re|&s;entful repre&s;entations, upon the enormous violence of her proceedings. Foreign princes al&s;o, &s;truck with the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, and infinitely &s;hocked at the im|perious pre&s;umption of Elizabeth, pre&s;ented her, upon this melancholy occa&s;ion, the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing remon&s;tran|ces; but nothing &s;hort of the death of Mary could &s;at|isfy tho&s;e baleful pa&s;&s;ions, which had obtained a tre|mendous a&s;cendency in her bo&s;om.

<P>The &s;ilence of Elizabeth to the&s;e reque&s;ts, and the comfortle&s;s and alarming &s;u&s;pen&s;e in which that &s;ilence involved Mary, would, had the unprecedented cruelty of the Engli&s;h queen admitted an aggravation, have given the fini&s;hing touches to her &s;y&s;tem of barbarity! Mary, however, continued to po&s;&s;e&s;s an a&s;toni&s;hing mea&s;ure of internal tranquillity; and her firm affiance in Jehovah remained a never failing &s;ource of con&s;ola|tion. Elizabeth, with an air of levity, &s;igned the death-warrant of the Queen of Scots; yet, fearful of the con&s;equences, &s;he &s;ought, by renewed application to the dagger of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, to remove from her&s;elf the public odium. Through the in&s;trumentality of David&s;on and Wal&s;ingham, &s;he recommended it to the keepers of Mary, <Q><HI>to &s;hed privately the blood of their royal pri&s;oner! Though a &s;overeign prince&s;s, and entru&s;ted with the cares of a great nation, &s;he blu&s;hed not to give it in charge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her mini&s;ters, to enjoin a murder! and this murder was connected with every circum&s;tance that could make it mo&s;t frightful and horrid.

<P>It is worthy of remark, that Elizabeth re&s;igned with her life, all preten&s;ions to that crown, of the titles and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of which &s;he was &s;o tenacious; that the &s;on of Mary mounted the Engli&s;h throne; that a prince&s;s, lineally de&s;cended from her, in the fourth generation, had the glory of uniting and con&s;ol|idating the realms of England and Scotland, under one general government; and that, if we except the u&s;urpation of Oliver Cromwell, the Briti&s;h &s;ceptre hath, from the death of Elizabeth, been continually &s;wayed by the po&s;terity of the Queen of Scots.</P>
<P>De&s;irous, my dear Margaretta, to delineate to you my &s;entiments, together with the rea&s;ons on which they are grounded, I have engaged in a more copi|ous detail than I had de&s;igned; yet it may lead you to an accurate &s;tudy of an intere&s;ting piece of hi&s;tory; and I &s;hall not dilate &s;o largely upon our remaining &s;ubjects.

<P>AS it is of importance to form ju&s;t ideas of per|&s;ons and things, I advi&s;e you, my dear, to give Sully's Memoirs a &s;econd peru&s;al; and, that you may do this both with profit and plea&s;ure, I proceed in my cur&s;ory remarks.</P>
<P>You ought, my love, to con&s;ider that the Duke of Sully was, <HI>comparatively,</HI> a private man. Henry was born for a nation, and the duke was born for the king. Henry undoubtedly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the talents of a great warrior and a great monarch&mdash;Sully was an able mini&s;ter of incorruptible fidelity and uncommon di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s. But while we do ju&s;tice to this illu&s;|trious &s;tate&s;man, we cannot, however, regard him as a faultle&s;s character; we think the treachery and di&s;&s;im|ulation by which he obtained from the Count of Soi&s;|&s;ons, and the Prince&s;s Catharine, their marriage con|tract, was highly reprehen&s;ible; nor are we quite &s;atis|fied with the duke of Sully for &s;o frequently holding up to public view the di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the royal pair. He too often unveils his hero; he dwells too circum&s;tantial|ly upon that part of his character in which alone he was vulnerable. It is true the importance of the mini&s;|ter is thus augmented, but this does not dimini&s;h our di&s;gu&s;t at the recital; and when he relates <HI>&s;o much,</HI> and with an affectation of delicacy, pretends to <HI>conceal a great deal,</HI> le&s;t it &s;hould ob&s;cure the lu&s;tre of his ma&s;ter's glory, the impo&s;ition becomes gro&s;sly palpa|ble; we lo&s;e &s;ight of the uniformly faithful &s;ervant, and behold only the ungenerous and ab&s;urd egoti&s;t.</P>
<P>Sully, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed was always at hand to extricate, but he is not <HI>therefore</HI> inve&s;ted with a <HI>general</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="034162_0524_0FFC6CBAA6F53C70">
&s;uperiority of character. The mind <HI>impa&s;&s;ioned,</HI> and debilitated by any <HI>particular circum&s;tance,</HI> becomes, in the <HI>moment of imbecility,</HI> unequal to cool deliberation; and, amid the hurricane of the pa&s;&s;ions, it is incum|bent upon the man of rea&s;on to point the better way, If Henry's di&s;plea&s;ure at his mini&s;ter was frequently without a cau&s;e, his re&s;entments <HI>appeared to him</HI> ju&s;t; and when inve&s;tigation di&s;covered his error, his frank acknowledgments were worthy his character; and the noble conde&s;cen&s;ion with which he invariably &s;ought a reconciliation, was an abundant compen&s;ation for any vehemence of pa&s;&s;ion to which his ardent na|ture &s;ubjected him. Con&s;tantly the fir&s;t to condemn him&s;elf for every intemperate act or expre&s;&s;ion, he delayed not the reparation, which was always as am|ple and explicit as language could render it; and he declared that con&s;equent on every amicable eclairci&s;&s;e|ment his &s;lumbers were more &s;weet, and he e&s;teem|ed the adju&s;tment of the&s;e grievances as an addition to his felicity. We cannot deny, that if the value and importance of the mini&s;ter was thus demon&s;trated, a mo&s;t enchanting idea of the frankne&s;s and candour of the monarch is al&s;o given. Henry was aware of the natural vehemence of his di&s;po&s;ition, and his good &s;en&s;e was con&s;tantly arming him again&s;t the inroads of pa&s;&s;ion. He was fully &s;en&s;ible of the errors into which the angry man is often precipitated; but virtue nerved his bo&s;om, and he &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed the a&s;|&s;aults of impetuous rage. A &s;eries of calamities, to|gether with his innate &s;en&s;ibility, inve&s;ted him with &s;elf command. Rea&s;on took the lead, and every re&s;entful impre&s;&s;ion &s;ubmitted to her dictates; he became mild by habit, and reflection rendered him uniformly ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Genero&s;ity was inherent in his &s;oul; and his innate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperiority, while it was far removed from the <HI>deba&s;ing effects</HI> of &s;elf partiality, invariably taught him to di&s;dain a malicious or ignoble action. Sully ob&s;erves, that Henry <Q><HI>never forgot to reward any additional trouble by &s;ome new in&s;tance of his bounty, and that every proof of kindne&s;s made upon his mind an
<PB N="179" REF="034162_0525_0FFC6CB7AFE083F8">
indelible impre&s;&s;ion;</HI></Q> and indeed his liberality was on all occa&s;ions truly princely.</P>
<P>No, my dear&mdash;Sully was not the principal artificer of Henry's glory; nature had early marked upon the mind of the youthful prince the features of heroi&s;m; his face was an index of his mind, and an elevation of expre&s;&s;ion and a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing frankne&s;s formed its general contour. His manners were in&s;inuating and full of vivacity; and even in the commencement of his career, his virtues and his talents extorted the approbation of all who knew him; while his bravery and his military abilities rendered him the &s;oul of his party. Henry cannot be ju&s;tly charged with a want of tenderne&s;s, becau&s;e Sully's memoirs pre&s;erve no record of his regrets on account of the death of his mother. It &s;hould be remembered that at the demi&s;e of the queen of Navarre, Ro&s;ny did not occupy that place in the king's bo&s;om, to which his merit after|wards introduced him. Catharine de Medicis was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tre&s;s of &s;ufficient addre&s;s to garb her treacherous and bloody politics in the alluring habiliments of re&s;pectful kindne&s;s; the Queen of Navarre, her family and adherents, were effectually deceived; nor did the wi&s;dom, experience and remarkable penetration of the Admiral de Coliquy, e&s;cape the &s;nares which had been laid with &s;uch exqui&s;ite di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>The ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew, which may be principally charged to Catharine de Medicis, will al|ways &s;tand prominent in the li&s;t of bloody tran&s;ac|tions. Neither high birth, riches, virtue nor talents, were a protection from the fury of tho&s;e licen&s;ed mur|derers, who were inhumanly let loo&s;e upon an un&s;u&s;|pecting multitude! Peaceable and unarmed, the de|fencele&s;s inhabitants imagined them&s;elves in the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity, when, in one tremendous moment, the horri|ble de&s;truction commenced. More than ten thou&s;and per&s;ons, with circum&s;tances of aggravated and unpar|alleled cruelty, were barbarou&s;ly butchered! and &s;o comprehen&s;ive was the infernal mandate which au|thorized this &s;hocking carnage, that it extended even
<PB N="180" REF="034162_0526_0FFC6CB4319B99A8">
to infants at the brea&s;t. The &s;treets ran with blood; and, "<HI>kill, kill, ma&s;&s;acre, the Huguenots,</HI>" was the watch-word of the furiou&s;ly zealous Catholics! That Henry, in a cata&s;trophe &s;o deeply tragical, &s;hould feel his individual griefs ab&s;orbed in the national infamy, in the national calamity, is a circum&s;tance which evinces the patrioti&s;m of his character; and it became him al&s;o to oppo&s;e, to the unprincipled and in&s;idious de&s;igns of Catharine de Medicis, a plan which might &s;erve as a barrier to tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs &s;he &s;till contem|plated. Henry was in no in&s;tance deficient in &s;en&s;i|bility. His &s;i&s;ter had made an unworthy choice, and it became him, as her &s;overeign and her brother, to di|rect and point her confidence; nor can his fraternal attachment with propriety be que&s;tioned.</P>
<P>Henry's fir&s;t reception of Ro&s;ny does honour to his feelings, to his gratitude, and to his liberality; and if he was ble&s;t with an able mini&s;ter, his mini&s;ter al&s;o was amply recompen&s;ed. The confidence which the king repo&s;ed in Sully, was a proof of his wi&s;dom and penetration; for it was the regularity and economy of the youthful candidate for his favour, which fir&s;t ad|vanced him in the e&s;teem of his &s;overeign; and this election, in a monarch, young, brave, impa&s;&s;ioned, and in &s;ome in&s;tances devoted to plea&s;ure, fully evinced the &s;olidity of his under&s;tanding. But a fondne&s;s for order &s;eemed inherent in the bo&s;om of Henry&mdash;<Q><HI>He was born with the virtues and method of economy, and therefore practi&s;ed them without con&s;traint.</HI></Q> He di&s;|tingui&s;hed judiciou&s;ly; and, di&s;criminating characters with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion, while he dive&s;ted fal&s;ehood of its glare, he &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a kind of intuitive knowledge of truth.</P>
<P>His martial genius, intrepid bravery, and full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of military talents, in all their &s;plendid variety, was evinced by his remarks, while yet a child, upon the terrors of the veteran &s;oldier; by the ardour which the relation of battles enkindled in his youthful bo|&s;om; by his undaunted heroi&s;m and ju&s;t ob&s;ervations at the battle of Moncontour, when he had hardly attained
<PB N="181" REF="034162_0527_0FFC6CB193297CB0">
his &s;ixteenth year; by his addre&s;s and bravery, in quelling the mutineers in the city of Eau&s;e, while his remi&s;&s;ion of their offences gave tho&s;e indications of his clemency, which his &s;ucceeding life abundantly con|firmed; by his admirable conduct at Nerac, extricat|ing him&s;elf by his valour from imminent danger; by the order of his march to, and his attack of, Cahors; by the hard&s;hips which, for five &s;ucceeding days and nights, he endured before that city; and by his un|daunted and memorable reply to tho&s;e who coun&s;elled a retreat&mdash;<Q><HI>'Tis Heaven which dictates what I ought to do upon this occa&s;ion. Remember then, that my retreat out of this city, &s;hall be the retreat of my &s;oul from my body. My honour requires this of me; &s;peak therefore to me of nothing but fighting, conque&s;t, or death.</HI></Q> Henry's re&s;ources in the mid&s;t of difficulties, and the &s;plendor with which he emerged from the mo&s;t de&s;perate cir|cum&s;tances, with the facility with which he accommo|dated him&s;elf to the mo&s;t laborious occupations in the military department, conducting the miners in per&s;on, and animating the workmen by every proper exertion, together with his capability of enduring fatigue, can|not but excite our a&s;toni&s;hment! His victory at Con|tras&mdash;his commi&s;eration for the children of adver&s;ity, and the veneration in which he held the meritorious &s;oldier&mdash;his generous aid of Henry III.&mdash;his arrange|ments upon the death of that prince&mdash;the invincible re&s;olution with which he &s;urmounted difficulties &s;uffi|ciently powerful to overcome a ho&s;t of warriors&mdash;his a&s;toni&s;hing intrepidity in oppo&s;ing him&s;elf, with only <HI>three</HI> thou&s;and followers, to an army of <HI>thirty</HI> thou&s;and men, alternately keeping guard in per&s;on, directing the trenches, &s;natching his ha&s;ty &s;u&s;tenance in the ditch, and denying him&s;elf a moment's re&s;pite from his un|paralleled fatigues&mdash;are &s;o many &s;plendid claims upon our admiration! His &s;ucce&s;s, in a combat &s;o unequal in point of numbers, as was the battle of Argues, a&s;|&s;umes a miraculous a&s;pect; nor can we withhold our veneration, while li&s;tening to his reply to the Count de Belin, who expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e at the inadequate
<PB N="182" REF="034162_0528_0FFC6CB00A7D12E8">

<P>The military hero unites conduct with courage; he coolly deliberates; and, what he theoretically re&s;olves, he practically pur&s;ues.

On the evening preceding this action, and in his &s;ub&s;equent conduct, he gave &s;triking proofs of a virtuous as well as a great mind; and his tenderne&s;s for Sully, who had been wounded in the battle, is &s;trongly <HI>evincive of that &s;en&s;ibility, in which you &s;uppo&s;e him deficient.</HI> Henry, con&s;idered as a warrior, in pur&s;uit of glory and of a crown, (his right to which was inconte&s;tible) gave a remarkable proof of the tran&s;cendent goodne&s;s and ex|qui&s;ite compa&s;&s;ion of his heart, by rai&s;ing the &s;iege of Paris, at a moment when its conque&s;t was within his gra&s;p, merely to prevent that carnage which he had di&s;covered his &s;oldiers meditated, in revenge for the ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew; and his permitting the be&s;ieged tho&s;e &s;upplies which it was in his power to cut off, was a fre&s;h triumph of humanity. <Q><HI>I am not &s;ur|pri&s;ed,</HI></Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q><HI>that the Spaniards and the chiefs of the league have no compa&s;&s;ion upon the&s;e poor people; they are only tyrants: For me, I am their father and their king, and cannot bear the recital of their calami|ties, without being pierced to the &s;oul, and ardently de&s;ir|ing to bring them relief.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="034162_0529_0FFC6CAC3A28D6F8">
The enemies of Henry bore te&s;timony to his rare qualities, particularly to his intrepid bravery. <Q><HI>By heavens,</HI></Q> &s;aid they, <Q><HI>this prince de&s;erves a thou&s;and crowns for his valour!</HI></Q> The ardour with which the king expo&s;ed his per&s;on on many occa&s;ions, and the vehemence with which he yielded to his in&s;atiable thir&s;t for glory, triumphed, in &s;ome in&s;tances, over that pru|dence which was generally a balance to his undaunted courage. Among tho&s;e daring exploits, which were &s;trongly tinctured with ra&s;hne&s;s, may be reckoned the action of Aumale; where he oppo&s;ed him&s;elf, at the head of one hundred &s;oldiers, to the Prince of Parma, who&s;e army con&s;i&s;ted of thirty thou&s;and effective men! But the valour and conduct of his retreat is perhaps unrivalled in hi&s;tory. The reply of Henry to the re|mon&s;trances of his friend, is the be&s;t apology which can be given for the&s;e deviations from his generally wi&s;e and prudent movements&mdash;<Q><HI>I cannot do otherwi&s;e; and, &s;ince it is for my glory and crown that I fight, my life and every thing el&s;e ought to be of no con&s;ideration with me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>An in&s;tance of the king's humanity occurs at Dreux; where, in the moment of victory, arre&s;ting the progre&s;s of death, he di&s;tributed &s;ums, proportioned to their ne|ce&s;&s;ities, among tho&s;e who, thus doubly conquered by his prowe&s;s and by his munificent clemency, could hardly help taking rank among the mo&s;t faithful of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Victory attached it&s;elf to the per&s;on of Henry where-ever he commanded; and it was univer&s;ally acknowl|edged, that to his own bravery and excellent arrange|ments, he was indebted for the &s;plendor of his arms. At the campaign in Burgundy, and the battle of Fon|taine Francois, he even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. The enemy with whom he fought were two-thirds &s;uperior in num|ber; but the Gallic hero was abundantly adequate to the mo&s;t arduous achievements; and his exploits dur|ing that action appear almo&s;t miraculous: Every thing, he was &s;en&s;ible, depended upon his own exer|tions; and, at the head of one hundred and fifty hor&s;e,
<PB N="184" REF="034162_0530_0FFC6CA9E32FFAF8">
he arre&s;ted the flight of that divi&s;ion of his army which had been routed; he oppo&s;ed him&s;elf bare-headed to the impetuo&s;ity of the victors; and, completely defeat|ing the enemy, &s;natched from them a triumph of which they &s;eemed already &s;ecure; and this admirable and well-timed exertion of valour, happily &s;aved his followers from that general carnage which would in|evitably have en&s;ued. But I do not aim at enumerat|ing all the battles and &s;ieges in which this monarch was engaged. I only glance cur&s;orily over the ac|tions of a hero, who was neither elated by pro&s;perity, nor depre&s;&s;ed by adver&s;ity. He communicated a por|tion of his ardour to tho&s;e among his followers who were the lea&s;t ambitious of glory. He was equal to every military duty; and his invincible bravery and indefatigable application excited that noble emulation, which is the parent of great actions.</P>
<P>But it is not as a military hero, EXCLUSIVELY, that Henry is entitled to applau&s;e&mdash;he was a patriot king. His &s;ubjects &s;hared equally his regards, while merit was &s;ure to obtain his patronage. His entrance into Paris &s;trongly marked his benignity, and his paternal attachment to his people. His &s;oldiers, exactly di&s;ci|plined, exhibited a degree of regularity that would have done honour to a well ordered family; and, tak|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;quares and &s;treets, in military ar|ray, the populace &s;u&s;tained not the &s;malle&s;t injury. His enemies experienced his clemency; and in that triumphant moment when he might have taken ample vengeance, <HI>a general amne&s;ty was proclaimed,</HI> and all tho&s;e who had borne arms again&s;t him were fully and freely pardoned. On the petition of the injured towns and villages, which, from the tremendous deva&s;tation made by the overflowing of the Loire, were &s;tripped of all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Henry thus directs his mini&s;ter: <Q><HI>God has given me &s;ubjects that I may pre&s;erve them as my children: Let them meet with tenderne&s;s and charity from my council. Alms are always highly acceptable to God, and in ca&s;es of public mi&s;ery more e&s;pecially &s;o. It would be heavy on my con&s;cience, if I neglected to do every
<PB N="185" REF="034162_0531_0FFC6CA75EB87C98">
thing I can for their relief.</HI></Q> Thus, in word and in deed, did Henry con&s;ult the public weal. He con&s;id|ered him&s;elf as placed at the head of a numerous fam|ily, who&s;e happine&s;s it was his duty to con&s;ult; nor did he he&s;itate in relinqui&s;hing his mo&s;t favourite pur|&s;uits, if he might thereby contribute to the felicity or emolument of his kingdom.</P>
<P>Henry's clemency to delinquents was de&s;criptive of the utmo&s;t lenity and tenderne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition. He pre&s;erved his &s;erenity and cheerfulne&s;s, even when &s;uf|fering from the &s;troke of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who had aimed an ineffectual blow at his life. He laboured to pre&s;erve Mare&s;chal Byron and other con&s;pirators; and he mag|nanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed by every offence, as far as was con|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of his per&s;on and kingdom. The noble frankne&s;s with which he received all tho&s;e, who, from whatever motive, had joined the league again&s;t him, greatly augments the &s;plendor of his renown. His way to the throne of France had been &s;trewed with difficulties and misfortunes, of a nature which required all his bravery and fortitude to &s;urmount; but, having attained his hereditary right, he proved him&s;elf greatly worthy the royal authority with which he was cloathed. His reception of Admiral Villars, who had thrown him&s;elf at his feet, whom he ha&s;tily rai&s;ed, ob&s;erving, that &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was due only to God&mdash;of the Duke of Maienne, whom he tenderly embraced, and of many others, was truly magnani|mous, and &s;erves to evince the inborn grandeur of his &s;oul. The cheerfulne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition endeared him to his friends and the nation at large. <Q><HI>The lineaments of his face,</HI> &s;ays Sully, <HI>had that agreea|ble liveline&s;s which forms a &s;weet and happy phy&s;iognomy, and perfectly &s;uited that engaging ea&s;ine&s;s of manners, which, though &s;ometimes mixed with maje&s;ty, never lo&s;t the graceful affability and ea&s;y gaiety, &s;o natural to him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The veracity of Henry was numbered among his prominent virtues. He pronounced an inviolable ad|herence to truth, the fir&s;t requi&s;ite in a man of genuine bravery and worth; and, when dictating the articles
<PB N="186" REF="034162_0532_0FFC6CA5A45BD898">
of capitulation at a &s;iege, the &s;acred regard he was known to pay to his word, rendered it to the be&s;ieged as acceptable a pledge, as the &s;tronge&s;t bonds which &s;u&s;picion could invent. Henry's feelings, as a father, hath not been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed: As a hu&s;band, if he was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uxorious, he was at lea&s;t manly and polite; and when it is remembered, that his matrimonial connexion was only the &s;uper&s;tructure of policy, candour will confe&s;s, that this was the utmo&s;t which ought to have been ex|pected from a prince &s;uperior to di&s;&s;imulation. If Mary de Medicis had been ble&s;t with di&s;cretion, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e attractions, addre&s;s, and feminine del|icacy, which have di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ome ladies, &s;he might, perhaps, have rendered Henry affectionate. It is to be lamented, that Margaret of Valois was not to his ta&s;te. I have always been particularly affected by the hi&s;tory of this prince&s;s; her merit appears to me inconte&s;tible: Her dignified re&s;ignation of the king; her unremitted attention to the per&s;on who &s;ucceeded her, and the rational attachment &s;he continued to evince for the royal pair, are circum&s;tances which announce her truly noble, and place her, in my opinion, with the fir&s;t of women.</P>
<P>Henry evinced his love of literature, by his patron|age of learned men; and it is with regret we proceed to &s;ay, that virtue mu&s;t deplore the deep &s;hade, too often thrown over the &s;hining qualities of the Gallic hero. His illicit attachments frequently enveloped in clouds the noble endowments of a mind, capable of exhibiting a fini&s;hed model of tran&s;cendent excellence. Yet, while we lament a deviation &s;o capital, it is with plea&s;ure we repeat a fact, which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as an <HI>e&s;&s;ential palliation of this &s;ingle error. Henry never &s;uffered a pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, of whatever de&s;cription, to arre&s;t tho&s;e valuable purpo&s;es which marked the magnanim|ity and heroi&s;m of his &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>But, you ob&s;erve, that Henry was an apo&s;tate, while the Duke of Sully pre&s;erved his religion. I am, my dear, plea&s;ed with your warmth upon this occa&s;ion; and yet it is true, that actions, proper and becoming to
<PB N="187" REF="034162_0533_0FFC6CA33947C9B0">
an individual, are not always &s;uitable to the head and repre&s;entative of a numerous and enlightened people. From a monarch, youthful, ardent, and devoted to mil|itary fame, we are not to expect an unyielding &s;y&s;tem of divinity. Henry was bred a Calvini&s;t; and per|haps this is the only rea&s;on which produced him, in the commencement of his career, a Prote&s;tant. The in|tere&s;ts of humanity loudly demanded a &s;acrifice of his particular mode of wor&s;hip; and it is &s;urely highly derogatory to our holy religion, to &s;uppo&s;e it calls up|on us to immolate the lives of thou&s;ands, merely for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a tenet, which cannot <HI>rationally</HI> be regarded as affecting the pre&s;ent intere&s;t or future feli|city of the creature. Perhaps the zeal of religion has betrayed many upright minds, and it may have enkin|dled <HI>fal&s;e fires</HI> in the bo&s;om of the <HI>per&s;ecuted,</HI> as well as the <HI>per&s;ecutor.</HI></P>
<P>France bled at every pore; &s;he was torn by inte&s;tine divi&s;ions; and her exten&s;ive provinces were on the eve of being deluged in blood!&mdash;Ought Henry to have perpetuated the mi&s;ery of millions, merely for the &s;ake of ideas, which, <HI>&s;trictly &s;peaking, cannot be &s;aid to con&s;ti|tute the fundamental articles of religion?</HI> Henry was a patriot king&mdash;Mu&s;t he exhau&s;t tho&s;e talents which were calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h the happine&s;s of a nation, in de&s;troying a people he was born to protect? Henry was a meritorious prince; he was entitled to felicity&mdash;Mu&s;t he devote him&s;elf to the calamities attendant up|on endle&s;s ho&s;tilities? If the king embraced the Cath|olic faith, he thereby became a mini&s;ter of peace; he might lull to &s;leep, or utterly exterminate the fiery zeal of per&s;ecution; the gentle &s;pirit of tolerance might be cheri&s;hed and invigorated; it would be in his power to arre&s;t and remedy the progre&s;s of tho&s;e di&s;orders which had de&s;olated France; and a happy or tragical cata&s;trophe was apparently involved in his deci&s;ion. The beneficent influence of a philanthropic example, recommended by, and originating from, the throne, would di&s;&s;eminate the mild principles of peace, love, and general fraternity. France demanded of.
<PB N="188" REF="034162_0534_0FFC6C9F3470CE00">
Henry a re&s;toration of her internal quiet. Tranquil|lity, affluence and &s;afety were in his gift. Lacerated, and almo&s;t expiring, while &s;he well near de&s;paired of relief, &s;he yet forcibly and energetically pronounced, that Henry's abjuration of Calvini&s;m would be a balm for every wound; that ho&s;tilities would then cea&s;e; and peace, with its attendant train of felicities, would once more ble&s;s her wide domain! And what was the conce&s;&s;ion which Henry was required to make? <HI>Not a dereliction of his God, either in the character of Creator, Redeemer, or Pre&s;erver;</HI> and the liberality of his &s;en|timents induced a per&s;ua&s;ion, that the Architect of all worlds was equally &s;erved by the <HI>&s;incere</HI> Catholic as by the Prote&s;tant. The ob&s;ervation of a few ceremonies was the &s;upernumerary he was called upon to embrace; and, con&s;idering the forfeiture embo&s;omed in his rejec|tion, rea&s;on will candidly acquit him. Be&s;ides, the king being a Prote&s;tant <HI>only in name,</HI> had never inve&s;tigated the peculiar tenets of his &s;ect; and the Catholic prie&s;ts, called upon at this juncture to defend their &s;entiments, produced in the royal pre&s;ence their mo&s;t &s;pecious ar|guments; while their Calvini&s;tic opponents, <HI>convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of the king's conver&s;ion, veiled before them; either declining to defend them&s;elves, or purpo&s;ely employing weapons which they knew to be unequal to the combat!</HI> Sully in&s;i&s;ts, that <HI>internal conviction was thus, in fact, forced upon the mind of the monarch;</HI> and, as the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of Henry's heart were ever open to Sully, the above repre&s;entation extorts our full a&s;&s;ent to the opin|ion of that mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>"But Sully pre&s;erved his religion inviolate." It appears, my dear, that the Duke of Sully had thor|oughly examined his faith, and that it had become the deliberate election of his riper years. Neither was he involved in the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity with his ma&s;ter; his <HI>individual aggrandizement</HI> would have been his only in|ducement to the relinqui&s;hment of his religious &s;enti|ments; and a motive &s;o decidedly intere&s;ted ought never to gain the a&s;cendency in a noble mind. It &s;hould al&s;o be remembered, that Henry's abjuration
<PB N="189" REF="034162_0535_0FFC6C9C9C6AB820">
was &s;trongly enforced and accelerated by the advice of Sully.</P>
<P>The truth is, Henry was a philanthropi&s;t; and tho&s;e beneficent plans which, at an early period, occupied his mind, not confined to France, included the whole Chri&s;tian world. Indeed it is from tho&s;e general ar|rangements, which, calculated upon a large &s;cale, em|braced all Europe, that he is more particularly enti|tled to the appellation <HI>great;</HI> and, the probability is, that had he accompli&s;hed his va&s;t purpo&s;es, his wi&s;hes would only have been bounded by the univer&s;e. Hen|ry was well qualified for the completion of his mag|nanimous de&s;ign; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an accurate knowledge of the &s;tate and various intere&s;ts of all tho&s;e countries, the general emolument of which he contemplated; and his intrepidity, profound wi&s;dom, and rare abilities, had become a univer&s;al theme. If I under&s;tand the va&s;t project which Henry had conceived, its object was to fa&s;hion all chri&s;tendom into one great family, or exten&s;ive republic, which republic was to be equitably parcelled out into hereditary and elective monarchies and &s;overeign republics; amenable, however, in &s;ome leading arrangements to a general council; and the divi&s;ion was to be made in &s;uch a manner as to remove every occa&s;ion of jealou&s;y or apprehen&s;ion; thus ar|re&s;ting the progre&s;s of the devouring &s;word, and put|ting a &s;top to that effu&s;ion of blood, and tho&s;e perpet|ual ho&s;tilities, which are an outrage to humanity. The members of this augu&s;t union were to be regulated and governed by one general plan; their pre&s;iding head, or chief magi&s;trate, was to be elected from the &s;everal potentates by the free &s;uffrages of the whole; and the affairs of this complex commonwealth, were to be ad|ju&s;ted by general and inferior a&s;&s;emblies, con&s;i&s;ting of deputies from the individual States of this Chri&s;tian republic; men were to be protected in the free exerci&s;e of their religion; toleration was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the rights of con&s;cience held inviolate.</P>
<P>Henry, in the contemplation of this &s;plendid achieve|ment, magnanimou&s;ly determined to reject all com|pen&s;ation
<PB N="190" REF="034162_0536_0FFC6C9B18D187E8">
for the expen&s;e and hazard of the enterprize. The boundaries which he affixed to the &s;everal powers, effectually barred France from all <HI>acqui&s;ition of territory;</HI> and he only re&s;erved to him&s;elf the glory of di&s;&s;emina|ting over the face of Europe the rich ble&s;&s;ings of har|mony and peace. That Henry &s;hould have been ca|pable of conceiving this plan, at a period when France was reduced by inte&s;tine divi&s;ions to the verge of de|&s;truction, and when he him&s;elf was nearly overwhelm|ed by misfortunes, is truly a&s;toni&s;hing! and that when thus &s;truggling with calamity, he was able to originate and organize the mo&s;t ardent and beneficial under|taking that could occupy the mind of man, is a cir|cum&s;tance which mu&s;t remain an inconte&s;tible proof of the grandeur of his intellect. This prodigious and &s;tupendous de&s;ign, was, at fir&s;t, utterly rejected by Sully; and he ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;es that his rejection proceeded from a temper naturally cold, cautious and unenterprizing. But upon examining the project in all its parts, he ardently adopted it; and, as delineated in his memoirs, it appears not only practicable, but highly rational.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that Queen Elizabeth had projected an enterprize, which an&s;wered in all its parts, feature by feature, to that of the Gallic hero, and this previous to the commencement of their corre&s;pondence upon this grand &s;ubject, and long before it had a being in the mind of Henry. It is to the honour of Elizabeth that &s;he was &s;olicitous to effectuate a revolution &s;o import|antly beneficial, without having recour&s;e to arms. Sul|ly &s;ugge&s;ts an idea, that Henry, after the conference at Dover, was indebted to the Engli&s;h Queen for the per|fecting of &s;ome parts of his &s;cheme. But the Gallic mon|arch, and his mini&s;ter, were enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirers of Elizabeth; they were filled with a&s;toni&s;hment at her po|litical abilities; they declare they cannot be&s;tow prai&s;es upon her adequate to her merit; they conceive that in <Q><HI>re&s;pect of wi&s;dom, penetration, and all the other per|fections of the mind, &s;he was not inferior to any king, the mu&s;t truly de&s;erving of that title.</HI></Q> Henry conceived
<PB N="191" REF="034162_0537_0FFC6C98B6A82830">
&s;he merited immortal prai&s;e; and he lamented for her, at her death, "<HI>as for a &s;econd &s;elf;</HI>" and indeed Eliza|beth's capability of conceiving, adju&s;ting and cheri&s;hing a plan &s;o magnanimous, together with her whole con|nexion with Henry, reflects a lu&s;tre on her character, that greatly adds to the fervor of tho&s;e wi&s;hes, which would endow her with <HI>con&s;i&s;tent magnanimity;</HI> it cannot but redeem for her a moiety of our e&s;teem; and we would gladly impute her whole tran&s;actions with the Queen of Scots to the influence of &s;ome infernal in|&s;tigator, who, throwing a veil over her better genius, impelled her to deeds truly diabolical.</P>
<P>At length, every thing was prepared for the com|mencement of tho&s;e operations which were to termi|nate in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace and equality, throughout the chri&s;tian territory. The trea&s;ury of Henry was amply repleni&s;hed, his re&s;ources were pro|digious, his army was embodied, his arrangements were made, allies were engaged, and contingencies were provided for, when the death of the Duke of Cleves, with the con&s;equent di&s;putes relative to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to his dignities and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, opened the way to, and gave the &s;ignal of, on&s;et.</P>
<P>But alas! the days of Henry were numbered! and this augu&s;t prince became the victim of that dark and inhuman zeal, who&s;e bigotted policy hath frequently been &s;tained by the blood of the mo&s;t excellent among mankind. It was, indeed, a fearful moment, and muffled in clouds, dark and portentous&mdash;the &s;uperin|tending genius of France, and of Europe, relinqui&s;hed its guardian&s;hip&mdash;the fiends of murder a&s;&s;umed the regency&mdash;and, when we reflect upon the &s;udden di&s;&s;o|lution of the &s;plendid pro&s;pects, which ro&s;e &s;o fair, and promi&s;ed &s;uch va&s;t emolument, around the dagger of the fell a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, ten thou&s;and augmenting horrors gather?</P>

po&s;terity, tho&s;e divine rights, delegated to him as a &s;acred depo&s;it, e&s;teemed every encroachment as a crim|inal inva&s;ion of tho&s;e privileges, for which he had be|come re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>
<P>With plans, originating in views receiving from pa|ternal influence and authority the &s;tamp of rectitude, he mounted the Engli&s;h throne; and his mea&s;ures were by con&s;equence very inclement to that ardent love of liberty, which then began to animate the pub|lic mind, and to induce a conviction that the de&s;cend|ants of one common Parent mu&s;t have inherited, from nature, an inherent and equal right to the tran&s;cend|ent felicities, attendant upon <HI>rational</HI> FREEDOM. Yet Charles, <HI>taught by experience,</HI> would have become the father of his people; but the unbending &s;pirit of the times, once rou&s;ed to action, and aided by unprinci|pled, intere&s;ted, and hell-born ambition, laid low a monarch, who, however widely he had mi&s;taken the path, was, neverthele&s;s, anxiou&s;ly &s;olicitous to promote the happine&s;s of his people.</P>
<P>The marriage of Charles with a prince&s;s of the Roman Catholic per&s;ua&s;ion; his attachment to the Duke of Buckingham; the war, in which he engaged, in con&s;equence of that attachment; the uncon&s;titu|tional demands which his nece&s;&s;ities impelled; his unwarrantable exten&s;ion of authority, in levying &s;hip money; the frequent di&s;&s;olution of parliament; ille|gal taxes; arbitrary impri&s;onment; billeting &s;oldiers; martial laws; the &s;evere and ill-judged zeal of Laud; the attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h Epi&s;copacy in Scotland; the pro&s;ecution of the citizens of London, in the &s;tar cham|ber; the de&s;potic proceedings of that court, and the repetition of extorted loans&mdash;were among the leading cau&s;es, which procured the ruin of a prince, calculated to give dignity to, and reflect honour on, any &s;ituation in life, in which he might have been placed. The noble &s;tand, made by the people of England in defence of civil liberty, and their arduous &s;truggles for tho&s;e rights and privileges, which ought, indeed, to be con|&s;idered as unalienable, can never be too much admired;

they are entitled to the e&s;teem and veneration of man|kind; and the manly and undaunted firmne&s;s, with which the Hampdens of that eventful day, oppo&s;ed them&s;elves to the encroachments of arbitrary power, will continue, to the late&s;t po&s;terity, to command the e&s;teem, and excite the emulation of every bo&s;om, ca|pable of that fervid and animating glow, which a love of freedom will invariably in&s;pire. But, when the amiable monarch, convicted of tho&s;e errors, which, originating in education, had been cheri&s;hed and con|firmed by intemperate councils, acceded to every de|mand which freedom, organized by rea&s;on, and &s;ub|mitting to the nece&s;&s;ary regulations of government, could &s;ugge&s;t&mdash;when his rebellious &s;ubjects, in defiance of every amicable overture, audaciou&s;ly continued their practices again&s;t the dignity, the government, the peace, and even the life of their &s;overeign&mdash;every indignant feeling takes the alarm, and we he&s;itate not in pronouncing their proceedings truly unwarrantable, and highly atrocious. A combination in favour of the <HI>Magna Charta of Nature</HI> mu&s;t ever en&s;ure appro|bation; but an attempt to &s;eize tho&s;e <HI>pre&s;criptive rights of the executive,</HI> which the experience of all ages has pronounced requi&s;ite to the due admini&s;tration of or|der, and the &s;upport of that &s;ubordination, which em|bo&s;oms the general weal, is a crime, the fearful con&s;e|quences of which, no human fore&s;ight can calculate.</P>
<P>Charles, mild and peaceable, and attached with even paternal tenderne&s;s to his &s;ubjects, entered with the utmo&s;t reluctance into tho&s;e &s;anguinary mea&s;ures that were deemed nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of re|gal authority. Vigorous exertions, at the commence|ment of the civil war, might have arre&s;ted that torrent of misfortunes by which he was afterwards over|whelmed. But the clemency of the monarch &s;uffered the moment to pa&s;s, in which, by proper and deci&s;ive movements, he might have obtained his own terms.</P>
<P>It does not appear that the de&s;ign was &s;imply to remove ob&s;tructions, nor to repair a decaying fabric; a project abundantly more comprehen&s;ive than that of

Every baleful pa&s;&s;ion was abroad&mdash;mi&s;repre&s;entations and malignant aggravations were countenanced. Ani|mo&s;ities obtained, with every pa&s;&s;ing moment, an a&s;|toni&s;hing augmentation of inveteracy; and the daring purpo&s;e was conceived and &s;y&s;tematized, of utterly de|&s;troying the venerable &s;tructure of government, and of aboli&s;hing forever that power, which had been, for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, regarded as the foundation or chief pillar in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution!</P>
<P>Deplorable was the &s;tate of the monarch! Sur|rounded by difficulties beyond the reach of human wi&s;dom to &s;urmount, or even to control! And as if the&s;e were not &s;ufficient, an attempt was made to fa&s;|ten upon him the odium of tho&s;e very calamities which pierced his bo&s;om with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow! nor did the finger of malevolence fail of pointing him out as the author of that horrible ma&s;&s;acre in Ireland, of the ri&s;e and conduct of which he was entirely ignorant, and which every principle of his &s;oul dete&s;ted. In the &s;truggle between the king and the parliament, many brave men lo&s;t their lives. Upon the virtues of the <HI>Falklands</HI> and the <HI>Hampdens</HI> of that di&s;tre&s;sful period, every reader will pronounce a panegyric. Their magnanimity, patrioti&s;m, undaunted bravery, and va|rious accompli&s;hments, although oppo&s;ed in arms, will en&s;ure them the undivided admiration of every &s;ucceeding generation. In the chalice prepared for the king, every bitter ingredient was to be infu&s;ed; and the parliament, apprized of his conjugal tenderne&s;s and fidelity, contrived to &s;tab him in the tendere&s;t part, by preferring an impeachment again&s;t the queen! Nor indeed was any &s;pecies of contumely &s;pared; the private papers of the royal pair were &s;eized and <Q><HI>pub|li&s;hed by the command of parliament, who took a vulgar and brutal &s;atisfaction in ridiculing all tho&s;e tender effu&s;ions which were never drawn up for the public eye!</HI></Q> It is impo&s;&s;ible to attend, without the extreme of grief and indignation, to the &s;upplicating monarch! to the con|temptuous

Over this melancholy figure of a deeply oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ove|reign, we cannot but weep&mdash;every &s;entiment of com|mi&s;eration is embodied&mdash;and we &s;pontaneou&s;ly rever|ence the royal captive!</P>
<P>In the fate of Charles, and Mary, Queen of Scots, who was his immediate grand-parent, there is, in many in&s;tances, a &s;triking re&s;emblance. Like her's, his troubles in a great mea&s;ure originated in religious di&s;|&s;en&s;ions. The &s;ame &s;pirit, which in the days of Mary per&s;ecuted Popery, now manife&s;ted equal acrimony again&s;t Epi&s;copacy; and the &s;ame vehemence was in ex|erci&s;e again&s;t the u&s;e of the liturgy, as had been hereto|fore oppo&s;ed to the ma&s;s. Both tho&s;e &s;overeigns had the grief to meet in ho&s;tile fields their rebellious &s;ub|jects, and both were compelled to fly for &s;helter to an implacable foe; both were betrayed, and in both in|&s;tances a <HI>&s;pecial edict</HI> was procured, on which to ground the proce&s;s that aimed at the lives of tho&s;e illu&s;trious &s;ufferers! They were alike &s;tripped of the externals
<PB N="197" REF="034162_0543_0FFC6C8A27B3C9B0">
of royalty, and they <HI>ineffectually</HI> preferred their ardent &s;olicitations to be heard in their own defence in the pre&s;ence of the two hou&s;es of parliament! while, by a u&s;urpation of authority, and under the regency of di|abolical pa&s;&s;ions, they were alike produced upon the &s;caffold. The fortitude and noble &s;erenity of Charles was as exemplary as that of his royal ance&s;tor; but although his own misfortunes wrung no tears from his eyes, or degrading complaints from his lips, his very &s;oul was pierced for the calamities of his friends! Yes, it con&s;i&s;ts with the te&s;timony of hi&s;tory to a&s;&s;ert, that no con&s;ideration of his &s;ufferings, as an individu|al, could de&s;troy his equanimity of temper; and al|though &s;eparated from the beloved companion of his bo&s;om, and dethroned by tho&s;e rebellious &s;ubjects who were hourly aggravating their crimes, by heaping up|on degraded maje&s;ty every &s;pecies of indignity! Al|though cruelly maligned, and bitterly inveighed again&s;t, impri&s;oned by his mo&s;t obdurate foes, and infamou&s;ly treated! yet, &s;trange to tell, the benignity of his countenance, and the equality of his deportment continued uniform and unbroken, while every move|ment &s;eemed to &s;ay&mdash;<HI>In defiance of tho&s;e accumulated evils, which have combined for my de&s;truction, I am &s;till a &s;overeign; and, &s;upported by con&s;cious rectitude, the &s;ub|limity of virtue confers upon me that kind of elevation of which no earthly power can de&s;poil me.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;oul-affecting meetings between Charles and his children, having moi&s;tened with the <HI>temporary</HI> tear of remor&s;e and commi&s;eration, even the eye of the obdurate Cromwell, mu&s;t in truth be beyond the power of de&s;cription! Charles &s;upported, through his mock trial, an admirable pre&s;ence of mind; and his intrepid fortitude and heroic firmne&s;s, while encoun|tering tho&s;e various and brutal indignities to which he was &s;ubjected, evinced that true magnanimity, which could only have belonged to a mind radically virtuous. The noble independence of lady Fairfax, and that un|daunted heroi&s;m with which &s;he bore her per&s;onal te&s;|timony, even in the pre&s;ence of the murderers of the

king, again&s;t tho&s;e &s;anguinary proceedings avowedly aimed at the life of her &s;overeign, will reflect eternal honour upon her memory!</P>
<P>To arre&s;t the progre&s;s of mea&s;ures &s;o atrocious, it was in vain that foreign princes interpo&s;ed their good offices; the pre&s;&s;ing remon&s;trances of the <HI>relenting</HI> Scots were di&s;regarded, and the pathetic &s;upplications of the weeping Henrietta were ineffectual! The Falk|lands and the Hampdens of that day, were, alas! no more! The affrighted virtues had either fled the Al|bion &s;hore, or were &s;eque&s;tered in the bo&s;om of a few upright per&s;ons, whom the turpitude of the times had deprived of all power! Yet amid this general derelic|tion of humanity, and prevalence of profligacy, we hail, with glowing admiration, the names of the Duke of Richmond, the Earls of Hertford, Southhamp|ton, and Lind&s;ay, who greatly &s;olicited permi&s;&s;ion to relinqui&s;h their lives, if they might thereby redeem from death their highly injured and virtuous &s;overeign! Nor can even the frozen bo&s;om of apathy refu&s;e, to this attempt to extricate the unfortunate prince, tho&s;e unequivocal expre&s;&s;ions of applau&s;e, that tran&s;cendent worth mu&s;t ever extort! The manly demeanour and heavenly compo&s;ure, which Charles exhibited, during the interval between his &s;entence and his martyrdom, his exemplary piety, the ardour of his devotion, the cheerfulne&s;s with which he marked the approaching hour of emancipation, adverting to the clo&s;ing &s;cene as a "<HI>great and joyful &s;olemnity,</HI>" and his addre&s;s to the &s;orrowful clergyman who attended him in his la&s;t moments, are &s;o many fini&s;hing &s;trokes of a character in which we involuntarily take an intere&s;t, and to which we feel our&s;elves unalterably attached. What mu&s;t have been the rectitude of that life, a retro&s;pect of which could furni&s;h no other &s;ubject of remor&s;e, than that <HI>extorted con&s;ent</HI> which he yielded to the death of the virtuous Strafford! E&s;pecially when it is remembered, that the Earl him&s;elf nobly in&s;i&s;ted on being made the &s;acrifice of a reconciliation between the king and the people, and that the withholding the
<PB N="199" REF="034162_0545_0FFC6C85481E1060">
royal &s;anction would not, upon that occa&s;ion, have pre|&s;erved the generous nobleman. This tran&s;action, however, pre&s;&s;ed hard upon the mind of the monarch, and he mentioned it with regret upon the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>Charles po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the virtues of the heart in an un|common degree, and his talents were undoubtedly great. Hi&s;torians delineate him as a man of &s;uperior worth, and uniform probity. They de&s;cribe him as the mo&s;t fini&s;hed gentleman, the mo&s;t ardent and faithful friend, the mo&s;t humane and compa&s;&s;ionate ma&s;ter, the tendere&s;t parent, the mo&s;t affectionate hu&s;band, and exemplary Chri&s;tian, that the times in which he lived produced. Nor can we wonder at the &s;ighs, tears, and lamentations, which we are told marked his exit!!</P>
<P>Peter the Great is our next &s;ubject; and this mon|arch, in regard to many circum&s;tances, &s;tands, <HI>as far as I have known,</HI> upon the page of hi&s;tory without a parallel. A cloud gathered round the morning of his days, and his education was little attended to; but genius &s;urmounts every difficulty; <HI>rich in native &s;plendors, it is &s;elf illumined;</HI> it is &s;uperior to every envelopement, and no barriers can confine its progre&s;s. The youthful Czar early di&s;covered an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for knowledge; his fir&s;t arrangements were de|&s;criptive of military ardor and talents; and enli&s;ting in the lowe&s;t grade, in tho&s;e regiments which he in|&s;tituted, organized and e&s;tabli&s;hed, he became a can|didate for preferment; nor would he accept promo|tion, until his abilities had rendered his right thereto inconte&s;tible. When we behold the Czar of Ru&s;&s;ia engaged as a labourer in the &s;hip-yards of Holland and England, we he&s;itate not in conferring upon him the &s;irname of Great! And we are at a lo&s;s which to admire mo&s;t, the &s;ingularity or the independence of that mind, which, in defiance of cu&s;tom, and tho&s;e enervating indulgencies in the gift of royalty, em|braced &s;uch unparalleled mea&s;ures for the benefit of a community, which his predece&s;&s;ors had been accu&s;|tomed
<PB N="200" REF="034162_0546_0FFC70AD39946AE0">
to con&s;ider as created for their individual emolument.</P>
<P>Peter was laudably ambitious of acquiring every u&s;eful attainment, and his information was various and re&s;pectable. With an eye of the clo&s;e&s;t inve&s;tigation he vi&s;ited the artificer, and his knowledge in the mechani&s;m of tho&s;e arts, to which he attended, was proportioned to his indefatigable diligence. In I&s;tia, and in the academy of &s;ciences in Peter&s;burg, they &s;till exhibit tho&s;e bars of iron, which Peter him&s;elf, without the aid of an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, &s;haped at the forge of Muller, affixing thereon his own mark. He demand|ed of Muller the wages which he allowed to other workmen, and he purcha&s;ed therewith a pair of &s;hoes, which he was particularly fond of di&s;playing, always ob&s;erving, <Q><HI>I have earned them well by the &s;weat of my brow, with hammer and anvil.</HI></Q> Peter drew from every circum&s;tance all po&s;&s;ible information; and, fond of con&s;idering him&s;elf as the <HI>pupil</HI> of <HI>contingencies,</HI> he was &s;olicitous to make the greate&s;t proficiency. His talents as a &s;oldier were far above a mediocrity; and although he was &s;ometimes un&s;ucce&s;sful, yet being taught the art of war by Charles XII. of Sweden, his military fame became con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The Swedi&s;h monarch a&s;cended the throne of his ance&s;tors, at a period when the nation, (who&s;e &s;ceptre he &s;wayed) had attained the &s;ummit of pro&s;perity; but, &s;eized with a kind of military frenzy, he aban|doned his native dominions, fought with prodigious intrepidity a number of battles, and achieved &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing exploits, as plunged his &s;ubjects into a train of evils, which well near accompli&s;hed their ruin!</P>
<P>It was from this hero that Peter learned the art of war; yet the better genius of the Czar finally prevail|ed over his ma&s;ter; and, after obtaining &s;ome impor|tant advantages, the deci&s;ive victory of Pultowa e&s;tab|li&s;hed his celebrity, and he had the glory of rein&s;tating the depo&s;ed Augu&s;tus upon the throne of Poland.</P>
<P>The Czarina Catharine, ranks among the mo&s;t ex|traordinary women of whom hi&s;tory records an ac|count.

The child of misfortune, &s;he was reared by the beneficent interpo&s;ition of pious charity; but, elevated by her beauty and her talents, to the throne of Ru&s;&s;ia, &s;he proved her&s;elf abundantly worthy of the confidence repo&s;ed in her. She was the con&s;tant companion of the Czar in all tho&s;e enterpri&s;es which he undertook both by land and &s;ea; and &s;he was, it is &s;aid, both an able coun&s;ellor, and a brave general. By her wi&s;dom and her pre&s;ence of mind, Peter was repeatedly ex|tricated from the verge of de&s;truction, particularly when he was encompa&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide at the battle of Pruth, and in the naval engagement with the Swedes, in the gulf of Finland. The order of St. Catharine was in&s;tituted by Peter, in honour of this Empre&s;s; and the inve&s;titure of the candidates were in her gift. Peter appointed this illu&s;trious woman to &s;ucceed him in the empire; and her arrangements up|on his death were de&s;criptive of con&s;ummate prudence. The academy of &s;ciences, at Peter&s;burg, was e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by her; &s;he augmented the navy, and pro&s;ecuted the project of di&s;covering a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age to China.</P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ia is indebted to Peter the Great for her civili|zation; he endowed her with power, re&s;pectability and dignity. He di&s;tributed her ennobled citizens in &s;ev|eral parts of Europe, that they might thus acquire and bring home tho&s;e improvements &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the public weal; and large gratuities were tendered to foreigners of ability, who &s;hould con&s;ent to become denizens of Ru&s;&s;ia. His in&s;titutions and e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, were numerous; his armies were organized and di&s;ciplined after the mo&s;t approved models; his fleets thronged tho&s;e &s;eas which wa&s;h the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hores; he erected fortre&s;&s;es, and multiplied commo|dious harbours; and, allured by a patronage &s;o pow|erful, the arts and &s;ciences, in the reign of Peter the Great, fir&s;t &s;ound an a&s;ylum in Ru&s;&s;ia. As a legi&s;la|tor, he was re&s;pectable. Peter&s;burg hails him as its founder; and many other cities which he reared, and canals which he trained, bear witne&s;s to his indu&s;try,
<PB N="202" REF="034162_0548_0FFC70A7F268B578">
and to the wi&s;dom of his admini&s;tration. He is &s;aid to have been a munificent prince; and his puni&s;hments are de&s;cribed as the &s;uper&s;tructure of ju&s;tice. He is characterized as upright, a&s;&s;iduous and mode&s;t; and we are al&s;o informed that he had &s;ufficient &s;elf-com|mand to deny him&s;elf the intemperate u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits, of which he was immoderately fond.</P>
<P>Yet many vices are attributed to Peter, who certain|ly, in &s;ome in&s;tances, was not <HI>great;</HI> and even my Margaretta complains of his rigour to his &s;on.

<P>In your &s;election from the worthies who fir&s;t plant|ed the virtues of civilization in this younger world, you have evinced much judgment. The private and political character of Governor Winthrop is perhaps without a blemi&s;h&mdash;<HI>his civi&s;m was the growth of rea&s;on</HI>&mdash;and he entertained principles which, as I conceive, are the e&s;&s;ence of all tho&s;e governments that are the &s;uper|&s;tructure of rectitude, or, in other words, that compri&s;e the well-being of both the <HI>governor</HI> and the <HI>governed.</HI> If there was a tinge of error in the &s;entiments or ad|mini&s;tration of this time honoured &s;age, it re&s;ulted from that &s;pirit of religious intolerance, which in his parting moments he feelingly regretted.</P>
<P>In tracing the eventful life of William Penn, the celebrated founder of Penn&s;ylvania, my mind is im|pre&s;&s;ed with an uncommon glow of admiration. It has been ob&s;erved, that the per&s;ecuted man becomes, in his turn, an inexorable per&s;ecutor: But Penn is an illu&s;trious exception to this general rule. He &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, from nature, a mind firm and dignified, and it was apparently imbued with every virtue that can &s;ublime or adorn humanity. His uniform adher|ence to the religion of his election; the patient firm|ne&s;s with which he endured the di&s;plea&s;ure of a belov|ed and revered parent; his clo&s;e conformity to the dictates of con&s;cience; and the noble independence with which he &s;urrendered him&s;elf to ob&s;ervances that &s;ubjected him to the cen&s;ure of the grave and the ridi|cule of the gay, are unque&s;tionable in&s;tances of the &s;uperiority of his mind, and commandingly demon|&s;trate a genius rendered luminous by its own inborn &s;plendors, and cultivated by &s;tudious application. Even his enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal, <HI>as it was never tinctured by

<P>Penn's religious &s;entiments early involved him in many inconveniences; we find him while a &s;tudent at the univer&s;ity of Oxford, &s;ubjected to the penalties an|nexed to non-conformity; the re&s;entments of his father were grievous and durable! He was frequently im|pri&s;oned; but he appeared equal to every calamity; and the elevation of his &s;pirit was not to be &s;ubdued! He di&s;dained, with hone&s;t warmth, that emancipation from his bonds which was to be the purcha&s;e of an abjuration of his principles; and his captivity was em|ployed in literary pur&s;uits. It appears that he exhib|ited a complete example of rectitude; and had he been long held in durance, it would have confirmed the odium of tho&s;e mea&s;ures by which he had been &s;o arbitrarily detained: But, acquitted by the verdict of a legal proce&s;s, his pri&s;on doors were thrown open; and the indignation of his father giving place to the &s;plen|did virtues of a &s;on, who reflected the highe&s;t honour upon his name and lineage, an act of amne&s;ty &s;uc|ceeded, and the demi&s;e of the old gentleman put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hand&s;ome patrimonial inheritance. His opulence, however, in no degree dimini&s;hing his devout and unalterable attachment to Quakeri&s;m, he &s;till continued obnoxious to an intolerant government. He was again impri&s;oned in the tower of London, whence he was transferred to Newgate, from which place, (after malice and tyranny had made an inef|fectual di&s;covery of their malignant inveteracy) he was at length relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Penn vi&s;ited many parts of Europe, and he was al|ways indu&s;triou&s;ly employed, both by preaching and writing, in di&s;&s;eminating tho&s;e &s;entiments which he re|garded as the offspring of truth: He conferred the high|e&s;t lu&s;tre upon the &s;ect to which he adhered; indeed his probity, philanthropy, mildne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, talents, literature, and great goodne&s;s of heart, mu&s;t be con|&s;idered

as conferring re&s;pectability upon human nature at large; and it was a mo&s;t beneficent arrangement in the economy of paternal Providence, which made Penn a proprietor in this new world. His abilities as a leg|i&s;lator have been exten&s;ively celebrated; and many of his regulations have been adopted by the wi&s;dom and experience of later days. We ble&s;s the propitious events and favourable gales which wafted him acro&s;s the broad Atlantic; and we mark with complacent veneration his judicious &s;y&s;tem of government, and the mildne&s;s of his admini&s;tration. His upright con|duct relative to the aborigines of this country, &s;o cal|culated to &s;ecure their affectionate confidence, was de|&s;criptive even of parental kindne&s;s, and was attended with the mo&s;t beneficial effects. His &s;acred regard to the rights of con&s;cience, induced him to e&s;tabli&s;h, with|out re&s;erve, that kind of toleration which admits the free exerci&s;e of all tho&s;e religious &s;entiments that orig|inate in an acknowledgment of the great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e, and produce the individual amenable to the laws of &s;ociety: And thus was Penn&s;ylvania rendered an a&s;y|lum for the per&s;ecuted of every per&s;ua&s;ion; while this circum&s;tance, &s;ays an elegant and judicious writer, "<HI>contributed more than any thing el&s;e to its pro&s;perity,</HI>" Penn, in fact, effectuated his philanthropic purpo&s;e&mdash;<Q><HI>He &s;upported power in reverence with the people; and he &s;ecured the people from the abu&s;e of power;</HI></Q> and we are almo&s;t ready to pronounce the term of his admin|i&s;tration, a renovation of the lap&s;ed nature. Indian ferocity was ameliorated by the uniform exerci&s;e of probity and tenderne&s;s: Mild equality a&s;&s;umed her mo&s;t captivating a&s;pect; and the colony is &s;aid to have exhibited a &s;triking re&s;emblance to a <Q><HI>father and his family; the latter united by intere&s;t and affection; the former revered for the wi&s;dom of his in&s;titutions, and the indulgent u&s;e of his authority. Tho&s;e who were am|bitious of repo&s;e found it in Penn&s;ylvania. The commu|nity were the &s;ame equal face&mdash;no one a&s;pired, no one was oppre&s;&s;ed: Indu&s;try was &s;ure of profit, knowledge of e&s;teem, and virtue of veneration.</HI></Q> But the patriot

legi&s;lator, &s;timulated by the &s;tronge&s;t incentives, de|parted for his native land, and clouds gathered round the infant government. Yet humanity cannot con&s;ider the philanthropic chief as in any degree reprehen&s;ible. The Engli&s;h pri&s;ons were filled with his per&s;ecuted and &s;uffering brethren; and his powerful interpo&s;ition, on his return to the Albion &s;hore, procured the en|largement of no le&s;s than thirteen hundred of his friends, who were held in durance.</P>
<P>The plan of the city of Philadelphia, which is de|cidedly the metropolis of America, and which at|tracts the attention and extorts the admiration of &s;trangers of every de&s;cription, was completed under the au&s;pices of Penn; and it may be a que&s;tion, whether, in proportion as &s;ucceeding proprietors have departed therefrom, they have not dimini&s;hed the beauty, elegance and convenience of the city.</P>
<P>A &s;uperficial ob&s;erver may be ready to a&s;k&mdash;Since Penn was &s;o nearly exempted from the depravity which adheres to the individuals of humanity, how are we to account for the calamities which encompa&s;&s;ed him, for his frequent impri&s;onments, and for the misfortunes which &s;eemed to attend the evening of his days? But reflection will &s;ugge&s;t the ineffable con&s;olations attend|ant upon a cour&s;e of virtue; and rea&s;on will not fail to point to that refulgent day, which, dawning in worlds beyond the &s;ky, will a&s;&s;uredly &s;ucceed the long, dark and heavy night of mortality.</P>
<P>The volume of manu&s;cripts, &s;o lately put into your hands, which contains many letters upon hi&s;tory, ren|ders it unnece&s;&s;ary to continue my remarks in this line. My future &s;ubjects will be circum&s;cribed within more narrow bounds; and I have, perhaps, &s;aid enough to &s;timulate your re&s;earches.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY GOOD YOUNG LADY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BLUSH not at receiving a letter from an old man, who is a &s;incere admirer of your &s;ex, and who cannot &s;ee an amiable and de&s;erving young girl, but he imme|diately becomes intere&s;ted in her movements, and anx|ious relative to her de&s;tination. Borne on the wings of imagination, he pierces the envelopement of futurity, he contemplates her, e&s;tabli&s;hed a u&s;eful and important member of &s;ociety, at the head of a well regulated family, or performing a &s;ubordinate part with that pro|priety, in which con&s;i&s;ts the prime excellence and val|ue of exi&s;tence. If he rever&s;es the&s;e agreeable expecta|tions, he beholds her adding to the circle of frivolity, &s;eeking to fill up time by pur&s;uits unworthy the atten|tion of a rational being, and turning with di&s;dain from tho&s;e qualifications, which are ju&s;tly reckoned among the fir&s;t acquirements in female life. Surely, the <HI>af|fected idler,</HI> who boa&s;ts an <HI>utter dete&s;tation of family at|tentions, and a total ignorance of dome&s;tic duties;</HI> who, ab&s;orbed in the multifarious enchantments of cards, &s;candal and fa&s;hion, becomes ardently ambitious of being con&s;idered as elevated to the very <HI>&s;ummit of in&s;ig|nificancy,</HI> is truly and di&s;gu&s;tingly ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="034162_0554_0FFC7099294B9438">
I will own to you, young lady, that in proportion as I conceive the charming maid is about, by her blamele&s;s and prai&s;e-worthy conduct, to add to the re&s;pectability and dignity of human nature, or to in|crea&s;e the number of u&s;ele&s;s triflers, who wear away their hours without <HI>plan, object, or even motive,</HI> I feel inclined to be&s;tow my benediction, or otherwi&s;e, to yield to the impul&s;e of contempt; and I will further confe&s;s, that I generally make my admea&s;urement of the de&s;tined progre&s;s of the intere&s;ting adventurer, by the commencement of her career.</P>
<P>Your mamma intimates that you love my Marga|retta, and that you will be influenced by the Gleaner. This information points the ardour of my wi&s;hes as they relate to you, and renders me doubly &s;olicitous re&s;pecting tho&s;e occurrences, the effects of which, in a great mea&s;ure, depend upon the u&s;e you make of your pre&s;ent hours. A young lady has taken a capital &s;tep, and obtained an admirable ba&s;is for the &s;uper|&s;tructure of improvement, when &s;he learns properly to appreciate the value of time. Tho&s;e important moments in which you may &s;ecure a fund, that will &s;erve as the re&s;ource of revolving years, are rapidly pa&s;&s;ing off; and it &s;hould be your care, to mark them by &s;uch attainments as may endear you to your friends, and render you acceptable to &s;ociety at large.</P>
<P>Your predilection for me will induce you to read attentively the letters of Margaretta and her mother, which have been produced to public view principally for your emolument: But do not, my dear, accept their &s;ketches of per&s;ons, writings and events, merely upon tru&s;t. With the be&s;t intentions in the world they may have erred; and I recommend it to you, to turn to the &s;everal authors they have occa&s;ionally mentioned, and after a careful peru&s;al of the volumes from whence they deduce their conclu&s;ions, compare your ideas with their's; let me know the re&s;ult; and thus give me an opportunity of tracing the coinci|dence, which I per&s;uade my&s;elf will appear in the &s;en|timents of elegant and informed minds. If Mi&s;s

Aimwell accommodates her&s;elf to my wi&s;hes, deter|mining to grant a reque&s;t, which is made with even paternal fervour, I am mi&s;taken if her mamma will again have rea&s;on to complain of her want of attach|ment to her book.</P>
<P>But, tru&s;t me, dear Mi&s;s Sophia, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to po&s;&s;e&s;s any thing valuable, without a due attention to method. If you &s;lumber away a large proportion of the twenty-four hours, and apply your&s;elf to the pur&s;uits of the day as chance or nece&s;&s;ity directs, your life is a &s;cene of confu&s;ion; what may be the work of <HI>any hour,</HI> is too often the work of <HI>no hour;</HI> and in the mean time you are &s;quandering that which the wealth of both the Indies can never redeem. Summon, my lovely young friend, that re&s;olution which is now, it may be, dormant in your bo&s;om; indeci&s;ion and in|dolence are alike enemies to the proficiency of indu&s;|trious virtue. Re&s;olve to appropriate your hours, and let their regular return pre&s;ent your needle, your book, your pen, or your pencil. Happily, yours is the age of flexibility, and a little per&s;everance will e&s;tabli&s;h tho&s;e habits, which will transform your ex|erci&s;es into the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites of your felicity. I can hardly conceive it po&s;&s;ible to in&s;i&s;t too frequent|ly or too importunately upon the incalculable value of order. It &s;eems to me to be the &s;tamen of every important attainment; it may be denominated the central orb of virtue; and it influences, invigorates and beautifies, both the aggregate and the minutiae of life.</P>
<P>Reflect a little&mdash;You are &s;ummoned to make one in a party of plea&s;ure; mu&s;ic, dancing, and all tho&s;e &s;o|cial enjoyments that di&s;tingui&s;h the convivial circle, it is expected will con&s;titute the amu&s;ement of a &s;cene, at which di&s;cretion is to pre&s;ide. But as the occa&s;ion will require a more than ordinary attention to your dre&s;s, as alterations are to be made, and ornaments are to be procured, much time mu&s;t be devoted to preparation; and as the&s;e particulars naturally come under the direction of your mamma, &s;he engages to
<PB N="210" REF="034162_0556_0FFC7094C055D4A8">
devote her&s;elf to the bu&s;ine&s;s. But the que&s;tion is, <HI>when will &s;he commence her employment? ten days</HI> are to elap&s;e previous to the promi&s;ed period, and there is &s;urely <HI>time enough.</HI> To-morrow the robe &s;hall be made; the next day the head dre&s;s&mdash;and &s;o on. To-morrow arrives, and the appropriated hours are &s;till deferred; day after day revolves, and the nece&s;&s;ary arrangements are yet at a &s;tand! Mamma bu&s;ies her|&s;elf as chance directs, and &s;he is occupied by her mi&s;|cellaneous avocations agreeably to the caprice of the moment. The important day at length pre&s;ents, <HI>and nothing is done;</HI> what a &s;cene of bu&s;tle and confu&s;ion &s;ucceeds; you mu&s;t ab&s;olutely either tarry at home, or make your appearance very ill dre&s;t.</P>
<P>Should your hou&s;e-maid be &s;uffered to neglect or to perform the bu&s;ine&s;s of her &s;tation without a due re&s;pect to order, your apartments would exhibit a &s;cene of anarchy, and you might chance to repo&s;e upon a bed badly prepared, or perhaps not made at all. Your cook, thrown from her accu&s;tomed routine of duty, would &s;erve your table with &s;poiled viands; and you are to congratulate your&s;elf that your mam|ma po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that &s;pirit of government, which a&s;&s;igns to proper per&s;ons and hours the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day; thus producing that uniform regularity &s;o e&s;&s;ential to dome&s;tic tranquillity. But you are not only to <HI>admire,</HI> but al&s;o to <HI>imitate.</HI> If indu&s;try and method are &s;o e&s;&s;ential in the inferior occupations of life, they are more indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite in the important bu&s;ine&s;s of forming and maturing the talents, pointing the virtues, and educating that intellect, upon which depends the future conduct of the youthful voyager.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e, my good young lady, the&s;e hints, and con|tinue to cheri&s;h in your gentle bo&s;om that flattering prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which you have hitherto acknowledged for your &s;incerely attached friend,</P>

<P>PERHAPS there is not, in the gift of art, a more prevailing incentive to propriety of conduct, than the <HI>hope of reward.</HI> To look for a recompen&s;e, is very con&s;i&s;tent with the dependent &s;tate of humanity; and it belongeth only to the Father of Intelligence, to move <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> and <HI>independently</HI> upon the great &s;quare of rectitude.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on no &s;ooner begins to bud, than the child is &s;timulated to act rightly, by the hope of a &s;ugar-plum, a gingerbread toy, or that more honourable inducement, a mother's approbating &s;mile. The &s;tudent calleth into action every effort, allured by the pro&s;pect of a new book, the eulogy of the preceptor, or an accelerated holi|day; and the man of letters, while he indulgeth con|templations congenial with his nature, is rendered more indefatigable in his re&s;earches, by the hone&s;t hope of a &s;plendid name. As the love of fame is more or le&s;s influential on every mind, it may be properly charac|terized a univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion; and we conceive, that the expectation of an honorary, if not of a lucrative compen&s;ation, frequently be&s;toweth the motive, and furni&s;heth the prevalent excitement, to good and proper actions.</P>
<P>Under this per&s;ua&s;ion we are induced to wi&s;h, that in every commonwealth, town and village, &s;ome par|ticular guerdon was a&s;&s;igned, to be annually be&s;towed on &s;uch per&s;ons as had attained, in pur&s;uits confe&s;&s;edly u&s;eful, a &s;uperior degree of excellence. I recollect, &s;ome years &s;ince, peru&s;ing a volume written by Mad|ame de Genlis, which contained a circum&s;tantial ac|count of an in&s;titution, that would, if I mi&s;take not, could I tran&s;cribe it accurately, exactly illu&s;trate my
<PB N="212" REF="034162_0558_0FFC708ED51C76F8">
meaning. Unfortunately, Madame de Genlis is not in my library; and a &s;ketch, drawn from a memory not remarkable for its tenacity, will be nece&s;&s;arily im|perfect. However, without aiming at the method or language of this admired lady, it may be &s;ufficient for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, if I am able to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t prominent features of a narration that gave me much plea&s;ure at the time, and indelibly impre&s;&s;ed on my mind a high &s;en&s;e of the utility of an <HI>expre&s;sly &s;pecified public recompen&s;e</HI> for eminent or &s;ingular virtue.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution, which is beautifully and elegantly commemorated in the pages referred to, received its e&s;tabli&s;hment at a very early period after the com|mencement of the Chri&s;tian era; It was the growth of Salency, a village in Piccardy, and owed its being to a St. Medard, who was a native of that peaceful hamlet, and &s;ole proprietor of the territory. Surely, the mind of this St. Medard mu&s;t have been cha&s;te, elegant, and highly &s;u&s;ceptible of every virtue. But tho&s;e amateurs of excellence, who have not traced the Fe&s;tival of the Ro&s;e in the highly embelli&s;hed writings of the French authore&s;s, are here pre&s;ented with an op|portunity of judging for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution is called, the Fe&s;tival of the Ro&s;e: The prize contended for, is annually furni&s;hed&mdash;this prize is a hat, fancifully decorated with ro&s;es&mdash;and the elevation it confers, enhances its value far beyond all price. The candidates for this expre&s;&s;ive emblem are females&mdash;it is always the reward of indi&s;putable &s;upe|riority&mdash;all claims but tho&s;e of virtue, are inadmi&s;&s;i|ble&mdash;the di&s;tinctions which originate in the gifts of fortune, beauty of per&s;on, or grandeur of de&s;cent, in|volve not the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ions to this honorary meed&mdash;and it is invariably adjudged by the voice of impartiality. The ceremonies attendant on the inve&s;|titure, are &s;aid to be the mo&s;t ancient which are now extant. Many centuries have witne&s;&s;ed its influence, and have reaped from its excitements the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tan|tial benefits. Three village maidens are proclaimed candidates for the en&s;uing year; and the ance&s;tors of
<PB N="213" REF="034162_0559_0FFC708D50CB4D18">
the&s;e girls mu&s;t be, for many preceding generations, per&s;ons of irreproachable lives and unimpeached man|ners. What an irre&s;i&s;tible motive is thus furni&s;hed for the ob&s;ervance of every rule of right! The de&s;ire of de&s;cending with honour to po&s;terity, and of &s;urviv|ing even the icy darts of death in our offspring, is, I pre&s;ume, inherent in every mind; and the knowledge, that a &s;crutinizing inve&s;tigation of our actions would annually &s;ucceed, even after we had cea&s;ed to be vi&s;i|ble upon this globe, would indubitably in&s;ure a more general and exact circum&s;pection of conduct.</P>
<P>The claims of the three lovely competitors, when e&s;tabli&s;hed by meritorious ance&s;try and per&s;onal worth, are formally pre&s;ented to the Lord of Salency, who&s;e office it is, to elect from this trio, the candidate who&s;e conduct, on a &s;trict inve&s;tigation, he &s;hall regard as the mo&s;t faultle&s;s. Every con&s;iderable action is brought to view; the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible information is &s;ought; wit|ne&s;&s;es are heard; circum&s;tances are compared; the mo&s;t upright conclu&s;ions are formed; and the Lord of Salency proceeds to proclaim the beauteous para|gon, queen of the approaching year. Nor is his ta&s;k invidious; for emulation, in the bo&s;om of females, who&s;e minds are properly turned, and who are edu|cated with &s;uch &s;plendid expectations, never degene|rates into envy&mdash;they are &s;en&s;ible that an election mu&s;t be made&mdash;they are within the circle of excellence&mdash;it is glorious to be con&s;idered as a candidate&mdash;to make one of &s;uch a trio, they have &s;tood upon the verge of perfection&mdash;another year may witne&s;s a confirmation of their claim&mdash;they have only to commence anew their efforts&mdash;tho&s;e efforts which the corro&s;ive murmurs of di&s;content would forever bla&s;t&mdash;and they he&s;itate not to join the acclamations, which re&s;pon&s;ive hail the lovely <HI>competitor.</HI> Many days previous to the ceremo|ny attendant on a be&s;towment of the prize, the name of the &s;ucce&s;sful candidate is publickly announced, and the &s;acred ai&s;les reverberate her prai&s;es; a certain day in the year is appropriated to the celebration of this fe&s;tival; its revolution is rendered important, by the
<PB N="214" REF="034162_0560_0FFC70876F5366F8">
reward it confers on virtue, and it is graced, by every effort of rural ta&s;te. It is &s;elected from the vernal &s;ea&s;on&mdash;its plea&s;ures are long anticipated, and its dawn is marked by all the fervour of youthful expec|tancy, &s;anctioned by the matured complacency of lengthening years. To the &s;eque&s;tered haunts of vir|tue, the Lord of Salency &s;hapes his path, and he en|ters, with a kind of veneration, a cottage which has reared to maturity &s;uch tran&s;cendent excellence; he receives the hand of the daughter of worth, and he conducts her, who is arrayed in all the charms of tri|umphant mode&s;ty, to receive the reward, deliberately and righteou&s;ly adjudged to merit.</P>
<P>The rays of royalty have &s;ought to ca&s;t over this in&s;titution, additional lu&s;tre. A monarch of France, per&s;uaded of its beneficial effects, and charmed with its &s;implicity, di&s;patched a favourite nobleman, who was commi&s;&s;ioned to pre&s;ent to the matchle&s;s maid a ring of value, with a ribbon of expre&s;&s;ive blue; and from this epoch the crown of ro&s;es is adorned by a blue ribbon, which flows therefrom in graceful &s;tream|ers; while amid the time honoured wreath, a ring obtains a con&s;picuous &s;ituation; and the cho&s;en maid|ens, who are &s;elected to make up the train of the queen, wear on their &s;houlders a blue ribbon in the manner of a &s;carf; thus carefully pre&s;erving the memory of an attention, which they naturally regard as truly dignifying. The queen, <HI>on the day of her coronation,</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;hed by every po&s;&s;ible mark of elevation; the proce&s;&s;ion is intere&s;tingly and plea&s;ing|ly affecting; the new elected &s;overeign is attended by twelve young girls, arrayed in white garments, and decorated by blue ribbons fancifully di&s;po&s;ed; twelve youths, who likewi&s;e wear the uniform peculiar to the day, form her e&s;cort. She is preceded by bands of vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic; and the commencement of the proce&s;&s;ion is announced by the martial, deep toned, and animating &s;ound of the drum. The &s;treets of the happy village are lined by long and thick ranges of admiring &s;pectators, who are collected for
<PB N="215" REF="034162_0561_0FFC7085EB8F3EC0">

<P>In the centre of the temple, a con&s;ecrated &s;eat is converted into a kind of temporary throne, which, adorned with more than regal &s;plendor, receives the elevated nymph.

The officiating clergyman then holding in his hand the emblematical|ly decorated hat, with a &s;olemn and affecting tone of voice, pronounces thereon a ble&s;&s;ing.

<P>The rites of public wor&s;hip being concluded, our young queen hath next to receive the renewed homage of an affectionately attached and crowded audience, who attend her to a con&s;ecrated &s;pot, fitted up by the hand of rural elegance, in which beautiful rece&s;s, this daughter of excellence, and queen of innocence, is met by duteous and expecting &s;ubjects, who approach her with tho&s;e &s;imple gifts that make up the riches of the village &s;wain, and which &s;he receives as the volun|tary tribute of well di&s;po&s;ed loyalty.

<P>If it &s;hould be imagined that our fair authore&s;s in the recital, from which the foregoing particulars are rec|ollected, is leading us over the enchanting grounds of fiction, it is &s;till capable of improvement; and the &s;cheme, although the offspring of imagination, may, neverthele&s;s, when made the &s;ubject of legi&s;lative con|&s;ideration, &s;ugge&s;t hints, and be productive of plans, friendly to the cau&s;e of every &s;pecies of excellence.

<P>On this &s;ubject I am reminded of an ob&s;ervation I lately heard from the lips of <HI>one</HI> of the mo&s;t valuable of our countrymen.

This Chri&s;tianized &s;age ob&s;erved,&mdash;He had often thought that in proportion as the
<PB N="218" REF="034162_0564_0FFC707E77BAB170">
female proficient advanced in the career of excellence, in exact &s;uch proportion &s;he <HI>regained her &s;uperiority in the &s;cale of being.

<P>Perhaps the de&s;ire of &s;way attributed to females, may inve&s;t this idea with a powerful &s;timulus to pro|priety of conduct; and yet I &s;hould que&s;tion the &s;ta|bility of a &s;uper&s;tructure erected upon &s;uch a founda|tion.

Doubtle&s;s, my readers have frequently admired the pleadings of the ingenious Portia, in the Merchant of Venice. Suffering the terrors of apprehen&s;ion for the worthy Antonia, we are ready, in his favour, to break the &s;taff of ju&s;tice, and to violate tho&s;e laws by which the &s;acred bands of government are clo&s;ely bound, and all its &s;alutary and e&s;&s;ential rights protected. We li&s;ten with eagerne&s;s to the newly announced advocate; and we experience a degree of horror while we hear him pronounce, <HI>that the Venetian law cannot deny</HI> the forfeit: that there is no power in Venice can alter a decree, &amp;c. &amp;c. Yet we are &s;oothed by his beautiful expo&s;tulation&mdash;<Q><HI>The quality of mercy is not &s;trained; it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven, upon the place beneath.

<P>A gentleman re&s;iding in one of the &s;mall towns in the neighbourhood of the city of Dublin, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a genteel competency, not only &s;upported the reputa|tion of an ancient family, but even added additional lu&s;tre to tho&s;e claims his ance&s;tors had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the e&s;teem of mankind. He knew the full value of the independence he enjoyed; and, although genuine ho&s;pitality, that true Hibernian trait, &s;u&s;tained no diminution in his individual character (his &s;tyle of living being in fact munificent) he was yet well aware that the ob&s;ervation of a regular &s;y&s;tem of economy was the &s;ure&s;t foundation for the continued exerci&s;e of that liberality which was inherent in his nature. Having no offspring of his own, he had taken into his hou&s;e a favourite nephew, who naturally be|came the object of all tho&s;e tender feelings and various emotions that &s;ucceed each other in the bo&s;om of a parent. His education was on the mo&s;t liberal plan; and every incitement to improvement was generou&s;ly furni&s;hed. The judicious arrangements which had been adopted, were crowned by &s;ucce&s;s, and the young gentleman attaining his twenty-fir&s;t year, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a mind well informed, admirably intelligent, and exten&s;ively accompli&s;hed. It was a received opinion that he would &s;ucceed to his uncle's e&s;tates, and the youth him&s;elf had imbibed, as a matter of cour&s;e, the&s;e rever&s;ionary expectations.

But, alas! on one fatal evening, three gentlemen, apparently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing integ|rity, and abounding in affluence, took apartments under this roof: They were engaged in a law-&s;uit, and they had claims to e&s;tabli&s;h, which required time to inve&s;tigate. They depo&s;ited in my hands a large bag of gold, to an immen&s;e amount, obtaining my promi&s;e that I would not deliver it, except the where party united to demand it. Some weeks had &s;ucceeded this tran&s;action, when, going abroad in the morning, as I imagined to pro&s;ecute their bu&s;ine&s;s, one of the a&s;&s;ociates returned in great agitation, conjuring me to
<PB N="226" REF="034162_0572_0FFC706B65781638">
produce the gold, affirming that their cau&s;e was brought on, that they &s;hould obtain a verdict on that day, and, if they were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the immediate means of gratifying their advocates, it would be lo&s;t for want of the nece&s;&s;ary efforts in their favour. In a moment of weak credulity, I yielded up the depo&s;it, nor was apprized by a &s;ingle foreboding of the ruinous con&s;equences, until the return of evening brought the other two coadjutors. I met them with a face of con|gratulation, concluding they had obtained a fortunate deci&s;ion; but judge of my &s;urpri&s;e when I learned that many days would probably elap&s;e, before they could be gratified by a hearing, and that they had not yet made their arrangements. My a&s;toni&s;hment was beyond expre&s;&s;ion; yet I was not apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;e|quences to my&s;elf. Con&s;cious of my own integrity, I &s;imply related the truth, and a&s;ked them what &s;teps they would take? With abundance of <HI>&s;ang-froid,</HI> they replied, they had no &s;teps to take&mdash;they had deliv|ered a &s;um of money to my care, obtaining my prom|i&s;e that it &s;hould continue as a depo&s;it, not to be relin|qui&s;hed but at the united demand of the parties con|cerned; and that, of cour&s;e, they &s;hould a&s;&s;uredly require it at my hands! Nothing could exceed my con&s;ternation; they delayed not to make their requi|&s;ition, and they took care it &s;hould be attended by the legal formalities. Neither my abilities nor my incli|nation admitted of a reimbur&s;ement &s;o unju&s;t. I made application to council, and was flattered by a certainty of a favourable i&s;&s;ue. An action was &s;peedily com|menced. Pleadings have been heard, and lawyers' fees, together with many <HI>etceteras</HI> have exhau&s;ted my re&s;ources. I have been barbarou&s;ly pillaged&mdash;to-mor|row is the day appointed for a final hearing&mdash;ruin &s;tares me in the face; and if I e&s;cape impri&s;onment for life, both my&s;elf and family mu&s;t be turned out hou&s;ele&s;s wanderers, commencing in the evening of our days, the &s;ad progre&s;s of indigence and beggary!"</P>
<P>"You are then po&s;itive that judgment will go again&s;t you," replied the young novitiate. "O, mo&s;t un|doubtedly,"
<PB N="227" REF="034162_0573_0FFC7068EA485740">
cried the landlord, "the law, I am told, cannot be wre&s;ted in my favour." "Permit me," returned our adventurer, "to obtain your confidence; you behold, in me, a per&s;on qualified to take upon him the part of an advocate for the oppre&s;&s;ed; and, if you will join me to your council, I feel a&s;&s;ured that your affair will terminate happily." "What, Sir," exclaimed the landlord, "are you &s;eeking the glean|ings of tho&s;e hard earned gains, which your wealthy brethren have &s;o rapaciou&s;ly plundered? No, Sir, I have no more pieces to &s;quander; and I &s;hould not be &s;orry, if I knew I &s;hould never more behold the face of one of your mercenary profe&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>The young man, allowing for the petulancy of a per&s;on, who apprehended him&s;elf on the eve of becom|ing the victim of misfortune, pointed by inju&s;tice, mildly returned&mdash;"It is nece&s;&s;ary, landlord, in order to your being con&s;idered as my client, that I receive a retaining fee. I have, in my own mind, no doubt of obtaining a &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue to your bu&s;ine&s;s; one guinea, however, will be &s;ufficient; and if I do not procure a verdict in your favour, I pledge my honour that I will return it." The landlord drew up a heavy &s;igh&mdash;"<HI>You look like an hone&s;t man&mdash;you may be an hone&s;t man&mdash;God forbid that I &s;hould ever &s;u&s;pect an hone&s;t man. Here, take it&mdash;'tis my la&s;t piece, and may it redeem its ma&s;ter's property.</HI>"</P>
<P>Matters thus adju&s;ted, the eventful morning at length dawned; the court was a&s;&s;embled, and the ad|vocates for the plaintiffs and defendant prepared to call into action their mo&s;t energetic abilities; while a re&s;pectable jury, arranged in due form, &s;tood fixed in mute and &s;olemn attention. The council for the plaintiffs urged, that the depo&s;it had ab&s;olutely been made, and a promi&s;e obtained that it &s;hould remain as a &s;acred tru&s;t&mdash;they expatiated eloquently and learnedly on the&s;e facts; and they concluded with a &s;olemn appeal to the jury, praying for a grant of that re&s;titution, which they &s;o ju&s;tly demanded. The council for the defendant endeavoured to invalidate
<PB N="228" REF="034162_0574_0FFC70668471C588">
tho&s;e affirmations, in&s;i&s;ting on the expediency of &s;trong|er proofs. It was their plan to perplex, by cro&s;s ex|amination, and at any rate, to procure a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the final determination. In &s;hort, it became evident that <HI>law,</HI> and <HI>apparent</HI> ju&s;tice, were for once con&s;train|ed to appear in oppo&s;ition to a deci&s;ion, which the un|bia&s;&s;ed equity of every mind would have unhe&s;itating|ly pronounced; and no hope for the poor, de&s;poiled, and betrayed landlord &s;eemed to remain.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this juncture our young gentleman produced him&s;elf at the bar. It was his fir&s;t pleading, and his mien and ge&s;tures were marked by a graceful and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing diffidence. His diploma was unque&s;|tionable, and he was announced as an advocate for the defendant. A confu&s;ed murmur pervaded the court; and the council, on both &s;ides, betrayed une|quivocal marks of di&s;approbation. It being, however, beyond their power to conte&s;t his credentials, he was permitted to proceed; and, with a mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance, he conci&s;ely delivered his &s;entiments.</P>
<P>"My lords, and gentlemen of the jury&mdash;I &s;tand up as council for the defendant; and to avoid giving this honourable court, and this re&s;pectable jury, any further trouble, we dive&s;t our&s;elves of every &s;ubterfuge&mdash;we acknowledge the ju&s;tice of the pleadings of the council for the plaintiffs&mdash;we freely acknowledge the depo&s;it, and the conditions on which &s;aid depo&s;it was made; which conditions were, that no part of the property &s;hould be returned, without the pre&s;ence of the parties &s;everally intere&s;ted; and whenever <HI>the three individuals, from whom we received the tru&s;t, &s;hall all unite to make the demand, preci&s;ely conformable to the letter of the obliga|tion, into which we entered,</HI> we are ready to deliver up the whole of the depo&s;it, with which we were charged."</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hment immediately moulded the features of the court; the extricating expedient was &s;o &s;imple, &s;o obvious, &s;o exactly conformable to the <HI>letter,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of equity, and in the &s;ame moment &s;o replete with protection to the upright but too credulous landlord, that it was wonderful it had not before oc|curred.
<PB N="229" REF="034162_0575_0FFC706402F6CA00">
But it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to give an idea of the unbounded joy of an Iri&s;h populace, a&s;&s;embled upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. Their &s;ympathetic feelings had irre&s;i&s;tibly engaged them on the &s;ide of the &s;uffer|ing ho&s;t, who it &s;eems had uniformly &s;u&s;tained the character of an hone&s;t man. Loud and affecting ap|plau&s;es reverberated from every quarter&mdash;they embrac|ed the young advocate in their arms&mdash;they would have borne him to his lodging upon their &s;houlders, and they could hardly be prevailed on to remit the&s;e clamorous te&s;timonials of their approbation. The landlord&mdash;but agreeably to my u&s;ual cu&s;tom, on every of the&s;e occa&s;ions, I very freely bequeath the delineation of his tran&s;ports, and his gratitude, as an exerci&s;e for the imagination of the &s;u&s;ceptible reader.</P>
<P>To our young adventurer, the high road to fame and fortune was now thrown open; hand&s;ome grati|fications were poured in from every quarter&mdash;he a&s;|cended with rapid &s;teps the hill of eminence, and he &s;oon became enriched beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine expec|tations. The whole of the judicious plan, laid by his venerable, his paternal friend, now became obvious to his under&s;tanding; he &s;ighed to embrace once more the hand of him, who, having endowed him with ca|pability, had compelled him to tho&s;e movements, from which originated his &s;plendid fortunes; and or|dering, upon a remarkable fine morning, a &s;uperb equipage, he took his way to his native village, at|tended by every ve&s;tige of that independence, which his uncle had made the condition of their future inter|cour&s;e. The &s;hades of evening brought him to tho&s;e well known haunts, where he found the good old man, reclining in an arbour, which formed a fit rece&s;s for age and contemplation. With expre&s;&s;ions of grate|ful, duteous and unbounded affection, he in&s;tantly pro&s;trated him&s;elf at the feet of this venerable parent, (whom he properly and pathetically hailed as his guar|dian genius) and his reception exceeded his fonde&s;t hopes.</P>
<P>The old gentleman evinced his wonted firmne&s;s and dignity of character; but the&s;e prominent traits
<PB N="230" REF="034162_0576_0FFC70627AB08D28">
were, however, blended with all a father's tenderne&s;s. Having rai&s;ed his nephew, he cla&s;ped him to his bo&s;|om&mdash;"You are welcome, my &s;on&mdash;right welcome to the&s;e aged arms, and to this, your rightful heritage&mdash;Think not you have any information to give me&mdash;the faithful being, whom I be&s;towed on you as a &s;ervant, has been my con&s;tant corre&s;pondent; and, in con&s;e|quence of my in&s;tructions, he has proved a clo&s;e ob|&s;erver of your actions. No movement has been con|cealed from me: and my emotions almo&s;t deny me utterance, while <HI>I pronounce that I know, and I approve.</HI>"</P>
<P>This re&s;pectably venerable &s;age continued, to life's extreme, a complacent witne&s;s of the elevation and confirmed celebrity of his nephew; and ere he clo&s;ed the &s;cene of mortality, his la&s;t rational act pronounc|ed this &s;on of his adoption the &s;ole heir of all his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions. Tho&s;e of my readers who are acquainted with the private hi&s;tory of the celebrated Mr. Delany, one of the mo&s;t able and eminent law practitioners in the city of Dublin, will readily recognize the&s;e outlines.</P>

<P>I PITY, from my &s;oul, every candidate for literary fame! If they are warm in the pur&s;uit, and en|gaged with ardour in the profe&s;&s;ion of their election&mdash;if they are indu&s;trious in their application, and unof|fending in their &s;ubjects, diligently labouring to endow them with every valuable property, of which they are &s;u&s;ceptible&mdash;if the precepts they inculcate are enforced by the example of their own lives&mdash;if they do and are all this, they certainly have <HI>much merit,</HI> and are entitled to no &s;tinted &s;hare of that applau&s;e, for which they are probably &s;olicitous. But alas! how are their &s;teps environed with peril! their family, their education, their per&s;ons, their characters&mdash;the&s;e all become &s;tand|ing &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation! while their matter, and
<PB N="231" REF="034162_0577_0FFC705E51DC4018">
their manner, are regarded as free plunder, and the invidious critic is deaf to the voice of candour!</P>
<P>What author but trembles at the critic's la&s;h! and how many are deterred from the eventful path, by the ap|prehen&s;ion of the lion in the way! And was <HI>real merit</HI> &s;oothed and encouraged, were faults detected and pointed out with mildne&s;s, was &s;trict <HI>impartiality ob&s;erv|ed, and ju&s;tice always the aim,</HI> I, for my part, &s;hould bid the lion roar on, wi&s;hing, very &s;incerely, that his terrors might become properly influential.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of &s;ome per&s;ons of &s;ound judgment and great abilities, that nothing more is left for a modern writer, than to give a <HI>new dre&s;s to old ideas;</HI> but great men are not infallible, and po&s;&s;ibly this con|clu&s;ion may be rather ha&s;tily drawn. Solomon &s;aid "<HI>there was nothing new under the &s;un;</HI>" but &s;ince the days of Solomon, what profound di&s;coveries have been made; how momentous, how honorary, and how u&s;eful! How have the arts and &s;ciences improved, and how has knowledge increa&s;ed in the world. The u&s;e of the load&s;tone&mdash;printing, that capital vehicle of in|formation&mdash;the art of war, <HI>meliorated</HI> by the compo&s;i|tion and u&s;e of gun-powder, &amp;c. &amp;c. while hardly a day pa&s;&s;es, on the which novelty peeps not out.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, true, that the heavie&s;t charge prefer|red again&s;t literary adventurers, is that of plagiari&s;m: After an original thought, a hue and cry is rai&s;ed&mdash;it is traced from author to author&mdash;the cheek of inno|cence is tinged with the indignant blu&s;h, excited by &s;u&s;picions of fraud; and a group of re&s;pectable char|acters are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand convicted of the high crime of <HI>knowingly</HI> and <HI>wittingly purloining their neigh|bours' goods.</HI></P>
<P>To condemn, upon pre&s;umptive evidence, is both treacherous and cruel, and it is a procedure which finds no place in the deci&s;ions of equity. I do not contend that plagiari&s;m is never practi&s;ed&mdash;far from it; I be|lieve it con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence of many a volume, and that it is a kind of depredation, which is too often the <HI>dernier re&s;ort</HI> of the &s;cribbler; but I <HI>in&s;i&s;t,</HI> and I can
<PB N="232" REF="034162_0578_0FFC705CBB965D30">
produce proof po&s;itive of my a&s;&s;ertion, that the charge of plagiari&s;m is frequently <HI>unfounded,</HI> and con&s;equent|ly <HI>unju&s;t.</HI> Originality is undoubtedly rare, and it is probable it will become &s;till more &s;o. A writer finds many &s;ubjects touched, and retouched, if not wholly ex|hau&s;ted; and, &s;hould his abilities embrace a new ob|ject, or even a novel arangement, he is condemned, ere he can e&s;tabli&s;h his hypothe&s;is, however &s;elf evident it may be, to combat the giant prejudice, to wage war with a ho&s;t of cavillers, to oppo&s;e him&s;elf to the bur|ni&s;hed &s;hafts of critici&s;m, and to with&s;tand the &s;ecret machinations of envy. But, every di&s;couragement notwith&s;tanding, I humbly conceive there is much more originality in the world, at this pre&s;ent time, than is commonly imagined.</P>
<P>What, I would a&s;k, con&s;titutes originality? or, in other words, cannot an original thought be twice con|ceived? Let not the critic &s;neer, before he permits me to explain my&s;elf. An idea is expre&s;&s;ed in conver|&s;ation, and a &s;tander-by declares&mdash;"<HI>I had this moment the &s;ame thought, Sir.</HI>" Query: In who&s;e bo&s;om was the idea original? Suppo&s;e, that in the days of Ho|mer, there had ari&s;en, in the wilds of America, or in any other remote part of the globe, a genius, who had delineated every idea of that immortal bard, who had painted the charms of another Helen, arming monarchs and heroes in the licentious cau&s;e of a per|fidious woman! who&s;e fertile brain had teemed with other Hectors, &s;kilfully oppo&s;ing them to that Achil|lean arm, which was nerved for their de&s;truction; &s;uppo&s;e his &s;entiments, his &s;imilies and expre&s;&s;ions had been nearly &s;imilar; and, (&s;ince nature, liberal in her operations, might have produced a <HI>&s;econd prodigy,</HI> the &s;ugge&s;tion cannot be ju&s;tly &s;aid to wear the fea|tures of <HI>impo&s;&s;ibility</HI>) &s;uppo&s;e proof irrefragable had been furni&s;hed, that not the &s;malle&s;t intercour&s;e had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the&s;e children of indulgent munifi|cence, and that they had not even a knowledge of each other's exi&s;tence; &s;hould we not, in &s;uch an ar|rangement, have characterized both bards, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing original excellence?</P>

For my own part, I am &s;o far from regarding it as wonderful, that a <HI>&s;imilarity of talents &s;hould exhibit a &s;imilarity of ideas, and even of expre&s;&s;ions, that I am really a&s;toni&s;hed &s;uch &s;imilarity is not more frequently demon&s;tra|ble.</HI> Let us reflect for a moment&mdash;Two beings, en|dowed with &s;trong under&s;tandings and clear percep|tions, are educated in different and far di&s;tant parts of our world; but their language, their government, and particularly their religion is the &s;ame; from the &s;ame decalogue their precepts are drawn; virtue is the goal to which they are pointed, and from one &s;ource every excitement to virtue is educed. Matu|rity is at length attained; and, &s;etting down to con|template a given &s;ubject, ought they to be accu&s;ed of plagiari&s;m, although their productions receive a kin|dred &s;tamp?</P>
<P>The good divine, who&s;e mind hath been early im|bued from that identical fount at which his cotempo|raries have quaffed, receives a like education, and like academical honours; and with religious &s;entiments exactly corre&s;ponding with his brethren, he mounts the pulpit, and opens the &s;acred book, ordained at once a &s;tandard of his te&s;timony, and the origin from whence he is to deduce tho&s;e momentous truths, on which he is to expatiate.

<HI>Early in the year</HI> 1784, copies of the whole of this poem were put into the hands of &s;everal gentlemen, who may perhaps recollect it; but &s;till it is <HI>only a manu&s;cript;</HI> and it is not until within a few months, that &s;he has met with that beautiful production, enti|tled, the Botanic Garden, the offspring of an elegant European pen, <HI>fir&s;t publi&s;hed in the year</HI> 1793; in which &s;he ob&s;erved, in the following highly fini&s;hed lines, <HI>the &s;ame thought.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>" Th' illumin'd mother &s;eeks with foot&s;teps fleet,</L>
<L>" Where hangs the &s;afe balcony o'er the &s;treet;</L>
<L>" Wrapt in her &s;heet, her younge&s;t hope &s;u&s;pends,</L>
<L>" And panting, lowers it to her tip-toe friends:</L>
<L>" Again &s;he hurries on affliction's wings,</L>
<L>" And now a third, and now a fourth &s;he brings;</L>
<L>" Safe all her babes, &s;he &s;mooths her horrent brow,</L>
<L>" And bur&s;ts thro' bickering flames, un&s;corch'd, below."</L>
</LG>
<P>Now it is <HI>demon&s;trably certain,</HI> that neither of the&s;e writers <HI>borrowed,</HI> or, more plainly &s;peaking, <HI>purloined</HI> from each other. Producing, therefore, the foregoing lines as a proof in point, I proceed to the &s;econd in|&s;tance. Previous to her peru&s;al of the Botanic Gar|den, &s;he had been reque&s;ted to write an ode on a very affecting occa&s;ion: This ode was to be publickly chaunted, for the benefit of a worthy young man; and it was an addre&s;s to the benevolence of the audi|ence. It is not my de&s;ign to give the ode entire; I on|ly tran&s;cribe the part which is nece&s;&s;ary to introduce the lines that &s;he imagined &s;imilar&mdash;thus they are expre&s;&s;ed:
<Q><L>YE &s;pirits bland, from heav'n de&s;cend,</L>
<L>Around this hallow'd temple bend,</L>
<L>With a&s;pect all benign:</L>
<L>Philanthropy, fir&s;t-born of truth,</L>
<L>Of paradi&s;e the faire&s;t growth,</L>
<L>Replete with powers divine.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Hov'ring around, we feel you pre&s;s,</L>
<L>This con&s;ecrated fane to ble&s;s,</L>
<L>Its pious rites to guard:</L>
<L>Benevolence, religion twines</L>
<L>With ble&s;t munificence de&s;igns,</L>
<L>And is its own reward.</L></Q>
<Q><PB N="237" REF="034162_0583_0FFC70510D611C20">
<L>Benevolence, who&s;e genial &s;way</L>
<L>Commi&s;&s;ion'd hath the new-born day,</L>
<L>And bur&s;t the pris'ner's chains&mdash;</L>
<L>Its progre&s;s can arre&s;t de&s;pair,</L>
<L>Can &s;mooth the furrow'd brow of care,</L>
<L>While mild compa&s;&s;ion reigns.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Thus, when enwrapt in Howard's gui&s;e,</L>
<L>To mortals lent from yonder &s;kies,</L>
<L>And borne on mercy's wing;</L>
<L>The depth of human woe he &s;ought,</L>

<L>Returning light to bring&mdash;<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The ode was publi&s;hed; and the writer was &s;ome time afterwards attracted by a re&s;emblance in the fol|lowing energetic lines, found al&s;o in the Botanic Garden:
<Q><L>The &s;pirits of the good, who bend from high</L>
<L>Wide o'er the&s;e earthly &s;cenes their partial eye,</L>
<L>When fir&s;t array'd in virtue's pure&s;t robe,</L>
<L>They &s;aw her Howard traver&s;ing the globe;</L>
<L>Saw on his brow her &s;un-like glory blaze,</L>
<L>In arrowy circles of unwearied rays.</L></Q></P>
<P>Many are the in&s;tances, which, from my own indi|vidual experience, I could record; and my volumes of manu&s;cripts, that I was po&s;itive were enriched with many original thoughts, from my delay to publi&s;h, have now, alas! been generally fore&s;talled. My plans, my ideas, my metaphors, <HI>ah, well-a-day!</HI> in almo&s;t ev|ery thing I have been anticipated; and whenever my lucubrations are pre&s;ented, <HI>innocent as I am,</HI> the prob|ability is, that I &s;hall find my&s;elf indicted in the high court of literature for the deba&s;ing crime of plagia|ri&s;m! Yet the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, although the offspring of many a careful hour, deducing very po&s;&s;ibly their highe&s;t charm from novelty, have now lo&s;t, even in my own e&s;timation, much of their power to intere&s;t and to plea&s;e; and I do not, I am free to own, very deeply lament their fate.</P>
<P>But a recent di&s;covery having &s;tripped of originality this my younge&s;t born, <HI>my pet,</HI> that I have cheri&s;hed

with &s;uch unremitted tenderne&s;s, culling for it the faire&s;t flowers, <HI>gleaning</HI> every &s;weet, and adorning it up to my be&s;t abilities; and now to find, that after all, I have been rearing the bantling of another! It is really almo&s;t too much for my philo&s;ophy to bear; nor can my atmo&s;t equanimity prevent the hag vexa|tion from adding another &s;core to tho&s;e furrows, which time and di&s;appointment have already &s;o deeply indented!!!</P>
<P>No, I can never part with it&mdash;&s;till it is the child of my adoption, and I mu&s;t ever remain its protecting father. Sympathizing reader, I will tell thee the &s;to|ry. Thou knowe&s;t how much I have prided my&s;elf upon the <HI>title</HI> of the&s;e numbers: It was ample enough for my purpo&s;e; it was una&s;&s;uming; yea, as humble as the &s;malle&s;t particles which fall from the granary of the opulent dealer; and yet by the wonderful force of its ela&s;tic power, it could extend it&s;elf over the va&s;t fields of &s;cience, wandering upon the &s;uperficies of the grounds, and &s;natching tho&s;e gems which are &s;ome|times the reward of indu&s;trious mediocrity.</P>
<P>It was, I have a thou&s;and times &s;aid, a complete &s;hield <HI>from every accu&s;ation of literary theft.</HI> It was&mdash;in &s;hort, it was abundantly commen&s;urate with my mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes; and what, in my e&s;timation, inexpre&s;&s;ibly enhanced its value, was, that I imagined it had <HI>never before been thus appropriated.</HI> Judge then, what were my &s;en&s;ations, when, two days &s;ince, turn|ing over a volume written by Voltaire, I ob&s;erved, among his account of literary publications, the follow|ing paragraph, which, by way of exciting thy com|mi&s;eration, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe, verbatim.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MANKIND are too prone to con&s;ider opulence and grandeur as &s;ynonimous with the fir&s;t en|joyments this world has to be&s;tow; and every effort is made for the purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;uming that &s;tyle of living, which may produce us candidates for a rank in a&s;&s;em|blies that are frequented by per&s;ons who are pro|nounced the fir&s;t people in a village, a town, or a city. Alas! alas! how erroneous is this calculation! Under the &s;miling countenance, which, to the &s;uper|ficial ob&s;erver, appears the &s;eat of contentment, what woes, what clu&s;tering evils may rankle! The broad laugh, de&s;criptive of &s;uch extravagant marks of glee, why it may be the frantic expre&s;&s;ion of de&s;pair; while tho&s;e contemplative features, where pen&s;ive re|flection &s;its enthroned, may be the index of a mind attaining tranquillity by viewing per&s;ons and things preci&s;ely in that arrangement which en&s;ureth compla|cency. Appearances, it is undeniably true, are not to be tru&s;ted; and the experience of every day evinceth, that a &s;uperb hou&s;e, rich furniture, and &s;plendid equipages, are not always <HI>infallible</HI> marks of the af|fluence of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>My friend, Pelatiah Carewell, was returning home|ward, after a weari&s;ome journey, taken for the di&s;po|&s;al of &s;ome articles of traffic, for which his frugality
<PB N="240" REF="034162_0586_0FFC704977ACF5D0">
induced him to imagine he could not afford to pay the commi&s;&s;ions con&s;equent on committing their &s;ale to other hands. Nearly exhau&s;ted by fatigue, he had hardly &s;trength &s;ufficient to urge forward his hor&s;e, who &s;eemed equally as di&s;pirited as his ma&s;ter. He was in an open &s;leigh, on a very rough road; it was in the inclement month of January, and the rude winds buffetted tho&s;e locks which time had plentifully &s;prinkled with venerable grey. Thus was Carewell circum&s;tanced, when a &s;uperb carriage, fini&s;hed in the highe&s;t ta&s;te, pa&s;&s;ed rapidly by him; the hor&s;es, richly capari&s;oned, were in a foam; the curtains in the front of the carriage were clo&s;ely drawn; it was attended by two &s;ervants, who&s;e livery was perfectly well known to Carewell; and by a glance catched at the &s;ide gla&s;&s;es, he di&s;covered a gentleman who was the companion of his boyi&s;h years. They were natives of the &s;ame little hamlet, were bred at one &s;chool, and began bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;imilar pro&s;pects. But Claudius had left the rural &s;eat of his ance&s;tors, and for many years had figured on a very large &s;cale in the metrop|olis. He had been a noted &s;peculator, had dipped deeply in navigation, and had accounts open with ev|ery capital hou&s;e in and about the city. Carewell imagined the pre&s;ent expedition of Claudius had for its object a vi&s;it of &s;tate to his aged parents, who &s;till continued at the village; and he reflected on the ele|vated &s;ituation to which fortune had rai&s;ed his quon|dam &s;chool-fellow, with &s;en&s;ations tinged with the deepening hues of envy.</P>
<P>How partial, thought he, are the di&s;po&s;itions of what we term Providence; from the hour in which I could write man, I have ob&s;erved a uniform &s;y&s;tem of economy; the beloved woman, who did me the hon|our to accept my hand at the altar, hath exemplified, through her whole life, a perfect model of di&s;cretion. Frugality has been the order of our hou&s;e: every un|nece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e has been ab&s;olutely precluded, and yet my circum&s;tances are very moderate; and if I would not leave pennyle&s;s tho&s;e whom I have intro|duced
<PB N="241" REF="034162_0587_0FFC7047E5F42BD8">
into being, I am, in advanced life, nece&s;&s;itated to continue tho&s;e exertions, and that rigid ob&s;ervance, which has attended me through my commercial career.</P>
<P>Claudius, on the contrary, entered on the privileges of manhood with marked avidity; he plunged head|long into the &s;tream of plea&s;ure; he has never been known to deny him&s;elf a &s;ingle indulgence; his build|ings are magnificent, his furniture is in the highe&s;t &s;tyle, his town and country hou&s;es are crowded with &s;ervants, his dre&s;s is that of a nobleman, his equipages are multiplied and &s;plendid, and both him&s;elf and fam|ily are in the fir&s;t line at every place of public and private amu&s;ement. What, in the name of wonder, is the &s;ource of his pro&s;perity? and to what cau&s;e am I to trace my own comparative depre&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>Such were the murmurings of Carewell; he drew up a heavy &s;igh, and gloomy di&s;content pervaded his bo&s;om. It was ju&s;t at this juncture that the high &s;heriff of the county pa&s;&s;ed him, as it &s;eemed, in full chace! This was a phenomenon that arre&s;ted the whole attention of Carewell; for an officer of ju&s;tice had never before been known to vi&s;it the peaceful hamlet of B&mdash;. His curio&s;ity urged him forward, and he had no &s;ooner reached his own dwelling, than he learned that Claudius had been taken into cu&s;tody, ju&s;t as he was entering the door of that cottage in which he drew his fir&s;t breath! that his fine e&s;tates were all attached, and that it was &s;uppo&s;ed, upon an equi|table di&s;tribution of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which Claudius had &s;o nefariou&s;ly obtained, his numerous creditors would not receive a &s;ingle &s;hilling on the pound!!</P>
<P>Carewell dropped a tear over the errors and the misfortunes of Claudius. He entered his little par|lour&mdash;neatne&s;s pre&s;ided, the blazing hearth had receiv|ed the poli&s;h of indu&s;try, the kettle boiled for tea, the elbow chair was placed in order, and Amanda, with open arms, and a &s;mile of rapture, welcomed his re|turn. His children, too, crowded around him; and a little &s;pruce waiting maid, under pretence of ar|ranging
<PB N="242" REF="034162_0588_0FFA656AB7B7D310">
the tea apparatus, catched a peep; while a dome&s;tic, who had grown grey in his &s;ervice, took the opportunity of repleni&s;hing the fire, to hail once more the benign countenance of his ma&s;ter. Carewell &s;eat|ed him&s;elf&mdash;his eyes and hands were rai&s;ed to heaven, and exclamations the mo&s;t extatic bur&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly from his lips.</P>
<P>"This decent and completely fini&s;hed tenement is my own; my income, combined with my regular ex|ertions, be&s;tows on me the ble&s;&s;ings of competency; every thing about me is elegant: Amanda is the mo&s;t amiable and tender of women: my children come forward with di&s;po&s;itions that authorize the mo&s;t plea&s;ing expectations; no man can advance a demand which I cannot immediately di&s;charge. What is &s;how, pomp, and all the retinue of fa&s;hionable plea&s;ures? real happine&s;s dwells not with them. Gau|dy apparel, cards, plays, a&s;&s;emblies&mdash;henceforth I &s;pend no &s;igh on &s;uch frivolities. Contentment &s;hall meet me in the bo&s;om of my family, and gratitude, eternal gratitude, &s;hall rai&s;e her altars in my brea&s;t."</P>
<P>Carewell and Claudius are contra&s;ts which are &s;trongly marked; but the intervening &s;hades are many, and from their example more than one u&s;eful le&s;&s;on may be dedu|ced; the fallacy of appearances are &s;trikingly exempli|fied, and we learn to e&s;timate the value of economy. We have &s;aid that profu&s;ion is not genero&s;ity; and the propriety of this ob&s;ervation mu&s;t be &s;ufficiently ob|vious. Many a time has the humane and well de&s;ign|ing Eugenio been called to lament that his extrava|gant benefactions to pro&s;titutes, vagabonds, and par|a&s;ites, have prevented his be&s;towing &s;mall &s;ums, that would have furni&s;hed hone&s;t indu&s;try with the means of obtaining a livelihood. Society is not benefited by the &s;hilling I &s;quander on him, who, depo&s;iting it in the next whi&s;ky or rum &s;hop, will i&s;&s;ue thence a di&s;|grace to his &s;pecies, and probably in a &s;tate of inebri|ety, which, rendering him incapable of attending to him&s;elf, may produce him, with di&s;located or broken limbs, a burden on the next pari&s;h. But how clear
<PB N="243" REF="034162_0589_0FFC704527285A60">
are his claims on my property, who &s;ues for the means of equipping him&s;elf with the implements of agricul|ture, manufacture, commerce or navigation. The truth is, the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>di&s;criminating,</HI> mu&s;t be appar|ent to every &s;ober ob&s;erver. <HI>Principle, plan, regularity, economy, charity</HI>&mdash;a wi&s;e man will embody every of the&s;e requi&s;ites, and to their combined admini&s;tration he will con&s;tantly &s;ubmit his movements.</P>
<P>Stories &s;eem naturally to produce or grow out of each other; and a little narration, although perhaps not exactly analagous to the foregoing ob&s;ervations, floats, notwith&s;tanding, amid the vi&s;ions &s;elected by fancy.</P>
<P>Flauntinetta was educated by the hand of di&s;cre|tion; but it is not always that education can over&s;tep nature, and Flauntinetta continued vain, &s;illy, and con&s;equently devoted to all the vagaries of folly. She lo&s;t her father in her infancy, who, repo&s;ing per|fect confidence in the good under&s;tanding, integrity, and tenderne&s;s of her mother, had left the whole of a very decent property at her ab&s;olute and &s;ole di&s;po&s;al; and committing al&s;o her daughter to her direction, he had re&s;igned into her hands the authority with which nature had inve&s;ted him. Flauntinetta was &s;oon capable of calculating her mother's income; &s;he knew &s;he was in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, and her warm imagination repre&s;ented her funds as &s;ufficient for ev|ery thing, which vanity and ambition had taught her to con&s;ider but as rea&s;onable appendages to a young lady of her figure and rank, and who was, be&s;ides, an only child. Honoria had educated her daughter on the mo&s;t liberal plan; and, labouring to implant in her opening mind a per&s;ua&s;ion that the mere exteriors of pomp were beneath her attention, no day pa&s;t, in which &s;he was not &s;olicitous to in&s;til &s;ome elevating principle or meliorating truth. Flauntinetta, how|ever, continued refractory; &s;he &s;ickened for the haunts of di&s;&s;ipation; was never happy but when vi&s;it|ing or receiving vi&s;its; and tho&s;e public entertain|ments, which &s;he was not permitted to partake, were
<PB N="244" REF="034162_0590_0FFC7041C9A77750">
viewed with the deepe&s;t regret. Silks of the riche&s;t kind, laces of the highe&s;t price, jewels, &amp;c. &amp;c. the&s;e all made a part of her reprehen&s;ible wi&s;hes; and ev|ery maternal check produced an altercation, during which &s;he tacitly accu&s;ed Honoria of mercenary mo|tives, of undue &s;everity, and want of affection.</P>
<P>Honoria, while &s;he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly endeavoured to tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> her views into a right channel, and to erect tho&s;e cau|tionary guards, which her tenderne&s;s and her anxiety convinced her were nece&s;&s;ary, firmly per&s;evered in prohibiting every improper indulgence. She was a <HI>di&s;creet</HI> as well as a <HI>fond</HI> mother; and her affection was cha&s;tened by judgment. The circles in which &s;he permitted her daughter to mingle, pa&s;&s;ed individ|ually under her judicious in&s;pection; and in&s;tead of the richly covered brocade or golden ti&s;&s;ue, the gen|teel per&s;on of Flauntinetta was habited in a neat, plain lute&s;tring; her laces were chiefly Engli&s;h rather than Bru&s;&s;els; and whenever her mu&s;lins were wrought, the flowers were the re&s;ult of her own in|du&s;try. She was &s;ometimes &s;een at a public a&s;&s;em|bly, but more frequently at a play; and the&s;e amu&s;e|ments, with private dancing parties, occa&s;ional vi&s;it|ing, and &s;ome rural excur&s;ions, during the fine weath|er, con&s;tituted the routine of her diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>But the&s;e economical regulations were a con&s;tant &s;ource of vexation to Flauntinetta. "<HI>See, mamma,</HI>" &s;he would exclaim, "<HI>how richly yonder lady is habited;</HI> &s;he looks divinely enchanting, and ab&s;olutely moves a godde&s;s." "And &s;ee, my dear," returned Honoria, "yon beauteous nymph, how exactly that plain mu&s;|lin is fitted to her elegant form; &s;he is a lovely young woman; her countenance is an index of &s;erenity, and I could almo&s;t venture to pronounce, that friend|&s;hip, truth and honour, with every feminine virtue, are the re&s;idents of her bo&s;om." Still, however, Flauntinetta entirely di&s;approved her mother's con|duct; and &s;he determined, whenever fortune &s;hould put it in her power, to make her&s;elf large amends for
<PB N="245" REF="034162_0591_0FFC703F2D2AA328">
the penurious di&s;cipline to which &s;he was, for the pre&s;ent, con&s;trained to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Thus rolled on the hours and days, which at length u&s;hered in the de&s;tined morn, equally dreaded by Honoria, and wi&s;hed by Flauntinetta. It was the morning that was to witne&s;s her e&s;pou&s;als to a man of merit, and of hand&s;ome property. The beauty of Flauntinetta had procured her an e&s;tabli&s;hment, that, had her mind corre&s;ponded with her per&s;on, would have been fully commen&s;urate with tho&s;e fine qualities &s;he would then have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. And Honoria, ere &s;he re&s;igned that power over her daughter, with which nature and the confirming arrangements of her hu&s;|band had inve&s;ted her, enforced with <HI>increa&s;ing ardour</HI> all tho&s;e excellent precepts &s;he had &s;o often inculcated; but Flauntinetta heard her with alarming coldne&s;s, &s;ecretly re&s;olving to di&s;obey her in every particular! and &s;he was no &s;ooner a hou&s;e-keeper, than, ru&s;hing into the &s;tream of di&s;&s;ipation, &s;he mingled with the mo&s;t incon&s;iderate of its votaries, freely indulging in amu&s;ements which rea&s;on and di&s;cretion refu&s;ed to warrant. Over the mind of her hu&s;band &s;he obtained an entire a&s;cendency, who was ready to exclaim with Milton's Adam, <Q><HI>That what &s;he wills to do or &s;ay, &s;eems wi&s;e&s;t, virtuou&s;e&s;t, di&s;creete&s;t, be&s;t; all other knowl|edge in her pre&s;ence falls degraded.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Honoria &s;till hovered round her, and like the mat|ron bird would have pointed out the danger; but the prudent regency of Honoria was no more; and Flaun|tinetta, who had ever regarded her mother in a fal&s;e point of view, now triumphed in her liberty, con&s;tant|ly receiving the admonitions of her anxious parent with an averted face, and &s;uch freezing expre&s;&s;ions as would have thrown the icy darts of death at any affec|tion le&s;s than maternal. A period of five years, how|ever, terminated the career of vanity, and the cata&s;tro|phe was truly deplorable! Sickne&s;s followed in the train of poverty, and a melancholy and premature death brought up the rear!</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="034162_0592_0FFC703D70345118">
Flauntinetta, the long incorrigible Flauntinetta, became a widow; and both her&s;elf and children were totally de&s;titute!! It was in the moment of her ca|lamity, that the eyes of her under&s;tanding being open|ed, &s;he con&s;equently beheld the revered guardian of her youth, adorned with every virtue which can digni|fy humanity; and, once more &s;heltered under the ma|ternal wing, &s;he hath, at length, learned to e&s;timate the value of rational tranquillity.</P>

<P>TO develop the various avenues to the human mind, exten&s;ive knowledge of men, as well as books, is nece&s;&s;ary. Virtuous principles are &s;ometimes &s;o completely muffled by vice, as not to emit even the mo&s;t attenuated ray by which to a&s;certain their exi&s;t|ence; and it &s;hould be the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who are &s;killed in the complicated windings of the heart, to make every effort to reclaim its wanderings. Mild per&s;ua&s;ion often procures the be&s;t effect; and malig|nant

pa&s;&s;ions are frequently mollified and duly attem|pered by acts of kindne&s;s: Yet it is a melancholy truth, that there are individuals who are proof again&s;t the interference of tenderne&s;s; and it is beyond a doubt, that in &s;uch in&s;tances coercive mea&s;ures become ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen&s;able. Adver&s;ity &s;ometimes proves a powerful operator; it throws down the barriers reared by the impious hand of atrocity; it breaks in pieces the nefarious purpo&s;e; it a&s;&s;uages the tumult, and &s;mooths the a&s;perities of the &s;oul; and it brings to light and e&s;tabli&s;hes tho&s;e &s;entiments of virtue, which were pro&s;trate in the bo&s;om. A well authenti|cated illu&s;tration of this truth is &s;trikingly pre&s;ented in the records of a family, who have long been re&s;pectable dwellers in the State of New-Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>Mercator, an opulent gentleman, in the interior part of that divi&s;ion of our country, beheld the wealth he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and all the independence it conferred, as the fruits of his own indu&s;try; and having in early life ate the bread of carefulne&s;s, he knew how to appreciate the harve&s;t, con&s;equent on his laudable exertions. He had laid in her grave the affectionate companion of his youth; but he continued wedded to her memory, and two boys, the only &s;urviving pledges of their mu|tual love, &s;hared equally the affections of his bo&s;om. Their education was preci&s;ely the &s;ame; but nature, true to her&s;elf, a&s;&s;erted her own prerogative; and, in defiance of every rule of art, produced them perfect contra&s;ts to each other.</P>
<P>Acetus, the elde&s;t, was a prodigy of vice! Deprav|ed, to the utmo&s;t degree of which humanity is capable, he &s;eemed to know no joy but in the mo&s;t daring acts of atrocity; and it was wonderful that he &s;topped &s;hort of an ignominious death. Yet, although highly criminal, he, however, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s; and having the art to throw over his enormi|ties the tran&s;ient veil of concealment, he had obtained, while on an excur&s;ion at a di&s;tance from his native village, the heart of a truly amiable woman, whom he wedded; and it was hoped that a virtuous connexion
<PB N="248" REF="034162_0594_0FFC7037E1FF1448">
would produce his reformation. But ill habits are not ea&s;ily corrected. The libertine too &s;oon threw off the ma&s;k; and the misfortunes of the ill-fated Matilda, with her two beautiful children, were pronounced ir|remediable!</P>
<P>Adra&s;tus, the younger &s;on of Mercator, was indu&s;|trious, frugal and di&s;creet; and with the exerci&s;e of genero&s;ity and every ennobling virtue, he was familiar. To Acetus, as his elde&s;t born, Mercator had appropri|ated the better half of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and he pur&s;ued every method which involved the lea&s;t probability of rendering him worthy his name and family: Alter|nately he remon&s;trated, &s;oothed and threatened; but Acetus was inacce&s;&s;ible to every mode of attack; and large &s;ums, conferred by the indulgence of his father, in&s;tead of being converted to the aid of an injured wife and her helple&s;s innocents, were devoted to the bottle, &s;quandered at a gaming table, or lavi&s;hed on pro&s;titutes! Mercator had but one &s;tep more to take: He a&s;&s;ured Acetus, that his &s;ucceeding to any part of his e&s;tates re&s;ted wholly on his total change of conduct. Acetus &s;miled at the unmeaning threat. That Mer|cator &s;hould di&s;inherit him, he conceived, an event not contained in the chapter of po&s;&s;ibilities; and, confid|ing in the <HI>&s;everely tried affection</HI> of his father, he di&s;re|garded this, as he had every other previous mea&s;ure, and per&s;evered in the path of ruin!</P>
<P>Months rolled on. Mercator drew near the clo&s;e of life; and, being in the full exerci&s;e of his rea&s;on, he deliberately proceeded, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to the con&s;tituting that te&s;tament, which, bequeathing to Adra&s;tus, his younge&s;t &s;on, his va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, pro|claimed that young man his &s;ole heir, and legally cut off all the prior preten&s;ions and natural expectations of Acetus! A few &s;ucceeding weeks placed Mercator upon his death-bed; and his di&s;&s;olution, accelerated, po&s;&s;ibly, by the atrocious irregularities of his enor|mou&s;ly offending &s;on, was &s;peedy and unexpected!</P>
<P>The hopes of Acetus now utterly extingui&s;hed, all the energies of his &s;oul took the alarm; and de&s;pair,
<PB N="249" REF="034162_0595_0FFC703571C758E0">
in his bo&s;om, became the parent of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;h|ing exertions! With a kind of &s;ullen indignation, he &s;trode from the man&s;ion of his late father, and making &s;ale of the few moveables which remained to him, in a tenement con&s;tituting a part of the paternal e&s;tate, and now devolving to his brother, he pathetically addre&s;&s;ed the innocent victim of his unwarrantable irregulari|ties: "Go, my Matilda," in a tone of de&s;pondency he exclaimed, "go&mdash;return to the &s;cene of thy better days&mdash;<HI>I ble&s;s God that thou ha&s;t yet a father to &s;helter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>&mdash;Take the&s;e cherub children; bear them to the author of thy being&mdash;he will receive them&mdash;<HI>he is in|deed a father</HI>&mdash;Acetus has no more a dwelling&mdash;<HI>I di&s;|dain the little moment that I breathe under this roof!</HI> Leave me, my Matilda, &s;ole object of my love and of my commi&s;eration&mdash;leave, to his unparalleled mi&s;e|ries, thy wretched hu&s;band. <HI>Acetus has not now the ability to provide for Matilda, or to &s;uccour her infants.</HI>" Through all the devious paths of vice, in which Ace|tus had &s;o daringly &s;trayed, Matilda had never wholly lo&s;t that a&s;cendency, which a mildly virtuous woman &s;o naturally maintains, even in the bo&s;om of culpabil|ity; yet, on this occa&s;ion, her tears and her remon|&s;trances were ineffectual! On her bended knees &s;he &s;upplicated him &s;till to continue her the partner of the woe-fraught &s;cene&mdash;but &s;he &s;upplicated in vain; and, well near &s;inking under the mighty pre&s;&s;ure of her calamities, &s;he returned to that abode, which had wit|ne&s;&s;ed her early hopes and fears, and from whence, on the wings of high-plumed expectation, &s;he had &s;o late|ly flown. But, to receive the haple&s;s wanderer and her lovely children, a father's wide extended arms, and &s;till more ample heart, were tenderly expanded; and &s;he continued with this revered and natural protector, a melancholy and beautiful model of &s;weet propriety.</P>
<P>Acetus, penetrating very far into the interior part of the country, laid out what he had rai&s;ed from the &s;ale of his goods in uncultivated lands, which he pur|cha&s;ed at a low rate; and he immediately applied him&s;elf, with unremitted diligence, to the felling trees,
<PB N="250" REF="034162_0596_0FFC70318A64DBB0">
and all tho&s;e preliminary arrangements, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary upon new grounds. To all his bad habits, in one de|ci&s;ive moment, he bid an eternal adieu; and &s;uddenly he became that very Acetus, which the good Merca|tor had, through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, laboured to produce. His efforts were prodigious; what man, indu&s;triou&s;ly intent upon emolument, could accompli&s;h, he a&s;&s;uredly did: But &s;till he was alone; and having expended every &s;hilling he could command in his orig|inal purcha&s;e, he had not the means of procuring la|bourers, nor could he obtain tho&s;e additional grounds which were highly nece&s;&s;ary to the completion of his e&s;tate. It was at this juncture, that the difficulties of his &s;ituation appeared to him in their mo&s;t glaring colours, when a blank cover &s;upplied him with bills to the amount of one thou&s;and pounds! It was to no purpo&s;e that he diligently &s;ought to inve&s;tigate the &s;ource of this opportune relief; and, in a manner equally my&s;terious, &s;ums, an&s;werable to his <HI>real exigen|cies,</HI> were from time to time furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>At the expiration of a few years, Acetus &s;aw him|&s;elf enriched beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. His grounds were exten&s;ive, remarkably productive, and uncommonly well &s;tocked. His buildings were multiplied, many of them elegant, and all of them in excellent repair. Heaven &s;miled propitious on the re|claimed prodigal, and all his enterprizes were crown|ed by &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In an elegant carriage, con&s;tructed for the occa&s;ion, Acetus appeared before the paternal dwelling which had &s;heltered his Matilda. The tender mourner had continued ignorant of the fate of her hu&s;band! Acetus was to be in all things eccentric! Mechanically &s;he approached the window&mdash;&s;he rai&s;ed her humid eyes&mdash;Acetus i&s;&s;ued from the carriage!&mdash;"Gracious Heav|en!" &s;he exclaimed, "continue my rea&s;on&mdash;my Ace|tus approaches. My children, behold your father!" In a moment &s;he was in the arms of her hu&s;band!&mdash;Acetus was re&s;tored to her&mdash;this circum&s;tance was of it&s;elf calculated to render her, beyond expre&s;&s;ion, hap|py
<PB N="251" REF="034162_0597_0FFC702D0F0DB2E0">
&mdash;But he was re&s;tored to virtue too&mdash;and was be|come worthy, not only of the tenderne&s;s of an affec|tionate wife, but of the approbation of rea&s;on, and the e&s;teem of every good per&s;on.</P>
<P>Acetus, accompanied by the father of Matilda, &s;pee|dily removed his family to his own ample and commo|dious &s;eat. Arrangements, pre&s;cribed by di&s;cretion, and &s;anctioned by rea&s;on, now took place. Matilda was the charming directre&s;s, and happine&s;s became the order of their lives. It was ju&s;t one month after Ma|tilda was rein&s;tated in all tho&s;e privileges and immuni|ties, to which &s;he was in every view entitled, that Acetus received the &s;ubjoined letter from his brother.</P>

"Thus, my Adra&s;tus, while the &s;igh of anxiety &s;wells my bo&s;om, I repeat that I have con&s;tituted you the guardian, <HI>during the continuance of his in&s;anity,</HI> of your unfortunate brother.

<P>IT is a common practice to arraign the de&s;poti&s;m of cu&s;tom; and, <HI>lovers of liberty,</HI> we revolt from every thing which would begirt us with the lines of nece&s;&s;ity. The truth is, depraved nature &s;purns at government of every de&s;cription; and &s;ince the fatal

era which engendered pride in heaven, and plunged a third part of its denizens into the aby&s;s of guilty di&s;|obedience, a &s;pirit of di&s;organization hath prevailed; and it is only in proportion as the di&s;orders in the mental world are rectified, and the mind informed, that we become &s;olicitous for the general good, and are confirmed pro&s;elytes to the beauty and propriety of order. It is undeniably true, that cu&s;toms, inju|rious to the well being of &s;ociety, have &s;ometimes ob|tained undue influence; again&s;t the&s;e, to &s;et our&s;elves in array, is laudable; but &s;till, tho&s;e rules which have obtained the &s;anction of revolving ages, &s;hould not, it appears to me, be di&s;carded for trivial inconvenience.</P>
<P>My reflections have been thrown into this train by a little incident, and a &s;imple tale, which perhaps I cannot do better than narrate, as the &s;ubject of this E&s;&s;ay. It was on the evening immediately preceding our la&s;t annual Thank&s;giving Day, that a worthy trade&s;man, &s;eated in my parlour in a contemplative at|titude, with folded arms, and eyes fixed on the cheer|ful hearth, as if he was preparing to pronounce a pane|gyric upon the beauties of my fire &s;ide, very gravely re|marked: <Q>This Thank&s;giving Day is really an im|po&s;ition on the free citizens of this State. It hath ab&s;olutely &s;wept away more of my running ca&s;h, than would have &s;upported my family decent|ly for a full month. I declare I &s;hould rejoice greatly to &s;ee the ob&s;ervance of a period, which orig|inates &s;o much extravagance, era&s;ed from our cata|logue of old fa&s;hion cu&s;toms, and I would very readily &s;ign its death-warrant.</Q> There is &s;ome rea&s;on in your complaint, &s;aid I; and if it has noth|ing to recommend it but barely cu&s;tom, I al&s;o would freely con&s;ign &s;aid day to oblivion. It is true, it may be urged, that it is rational and pious to devote a par|ticular day to offer up our joint prai&s;es, and to manife&s;t our united gratitude to that omnipotent and all-gra|cious Being, who gives us &s;o richly to enjoy; but to this it will be replied, that our ori&s;ons and thank&s;giv|ing ought to a&s;cend with every returning day, that
<PB N="255" REF="034162_0601_0FFC702B7526C020">
God is not now honoured by the blood of tho&s;e inno|cents, which are the u&s;ual victims of a Thank&s;giving Day; that luxury enervates both bodily and intellec|tual health; and, that my friend, the trade&s;man above cited, is not the only &s;ufferer from the extravagant profu&s;ion of a Thank&s;giving Day.</P>
<P>All this is pointed by conviction; but my mind, fond of inve&s;tigating, doth not ea&s;ily yield its a&s;&s;ent to a di&s;puted hypothe&s;is; and in the cour&s;e of the week which contained our la&s;t annual gala, I termi|nated a &s;entimental ramble, during which I had &s;e|riou&s;ly reflected on the &s;ubject, by a vi&s;it to a valuable woman, whom I have long known; and ob&s;erving, that in her accu&s;tomed manner &s;he had di&s;tingui&s;hed the era by di&s;tributing to the nece&s;&s;itous, I could not forbear remarking on that benevolence which was eminently prevalent in her bo&s;om; while, on her part, that &s;he might effectually arre&s;t words which were i&s;&s;u|ing in a panegyric on her virtues, &s;he immediately drew my attention to an unfortunate female, with whom &s;he had ju&s;t parted. This female was born in a rank of life generally exempted from &s;ervile depen|dence; for he who derives his &s;upport from the real or imaginary exigencies of the opulent, admitting he is indu&s;trious and frugal, almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily commands re&s;pectability; and the young Ur&s;ula was cradled in the tranquil rece&s;&s;es of competency; &s;he was nouri&s;h|ed, cultured, and reared to maturity by parental ten|derne&s;s; and the peaceful morning of her days was protected by a father's love. But Heaven deprived her of her maternal parent, who&s;e place was &s;oon fill|ed by a &s;tep-mother; and a train of tho&s;e evils &s;uc|ceeded, which too commonly re&s;ult from &s;econd mar|riages, when children were the offspring of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Ur&s;ula was marked the daughter of &s;ufferance; but a &s;hort interval &s;ucceeded her father's ill judged connexion, ere &s;he was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of pro|viding for her&s;elf; various misfortunes have attended her &s;olitary &s;teps; and, mortified and di&s;pirited by the pro&s;tration of her early hopes, the di&s;po&s;ition of

her mind hath acquired a gloomy kind of acrimony; &s;he hath pa&s;&s;ed through life without forming a par|ticular connexion, a prey to regret, di&s;&s;atisfied with her&s;elf, and with a world to which &s;he is &s;o little in|debted. She is now far advanced in years, and &s;he is &s;truggling with infirmities. A &s;cirrhus, from the progre&s;s of which &s;he at times &s;uffers exqui&s;ite pain, is gradually poi&s;oning the &s;prings of life; yet &s;he may &s;till live long; and although her exertions to obtain the <HI>means of living</HI> have been marked with unremitted indu&s;try, &s;he hath, notwith&s;tanding, been frequently reduced to the la&s;t extremity. Of pecuniary inconve|nience, however, &s;he hath &s;eldom been heard to com|plain. She hath almo&s;t invariably pre&s;erved a decent kind of pride, which hath impo&s;ed upon her lips, in this re&s;pect, the &s;eal of &s;ilence.</P>
<P>But on the day immediately preceding our la&s;t Thank&s;giving, comparing, doubtle&s;s, the a&s;pect of this returning fe&s;tival to tho&s;e which had formerly met her view, her fortitude for&s;ook her; and, pale, emaciated and de&s;ponding, &s;he &s;ought the parlour of my philanthropic friend.

of paternal wi&s;dom, of paternal love.</Q> Ur&s;ula bow|ed in &s;ilence; &s;he was too full to &s;peak; but an af|fecting kind of patient re&s;ignation &s;eemed gradually to pervade her grief-worn countenance.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this period, a gentleman entered the apart|ment: He had occa&s;ionally &s;een Ur&s;ula, and he was a man of humanity. Ur&s;ula, afflicted, and much op|pre&s;&s;ed, would have mode&s;tly retired; but our philan|thropic gentleman detained her. <Q>How are you, Ur|&s;ula?</Q> "Well, I thank you, Sir," returned the poor unfortunate. "You do not look well, Ur&s;ula&mdash;<HI>to-morrow will be Thank&s;giving Day</HI>&mdash;I would have every heart glad <HI>on that day</HI>"&mdash;and he gave Ur&s;ula a hand&s;ome benefaction.

<P>Ur&s;ula courte&s;ied, bur&s;t into tears, and withdrew. A ray of hope once more illumined the bo&s;om of the cheerle&s;s traveller; &s;he was animated to new exertions, and again re&s;uming her plans of indu&s;try, &s;he imme|diately &s;at out for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecuring &s;ome work, which a fear &s;he &s;hould not be able to accompli&s;h, had induced her to relinqui&s;h. On her way, &s;he looked in on a per&s;on, whom &s;he had been regularly in the habit of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, for the reimbur&s;ement of a debt, incurred in order to provide her&s;elf with a &s;mall bed, on which to repo&s;e her weary limbs. Ur&s;ula po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great rec|titude and integrity of &s;oul; and the reflections occa&s;ion|ed by a recollection of engagements &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly never be able to fulfil, had frequently tortured her bo|&s;om; but &s;he now met her creditor with an invigor|ated pro&s;pect of being one day able to di&s;charge the la&s;t farthing.</P>
<P>Lucinda was her creditor; &s;he is a young and ami|able woman; &s;he is an orphan too, and altogether dependent on her own efforts for her &s;upport: But, while ingenuity is her handmaid, competency hovers

Yet, let me repeat, Lucinda cannot command a &s;ingle penny, but what &s;he receives as a compen&s;ation for her ingenious and per&s;evering efforts at her needle.

Go then, and do homage to a little milliner, not a hundred miles from Cornhill!</P>
<P>Ur&s;ula ble&s;t her youthful benefactre&s;s, and return|ed to communicate her good fortune to my benevolent and &s;ympathizing friend. It &s;eemed, upon that day, that the genius of benignity had been bu&s;ily employed in favour of Ur&s;ula.

<P><HI>Thank&s;giving Day</HI> arrived&mdash;it was whi&s;pered that Ur&s;ula had &s;aid &s;he had not &s;ufficient in the world to purcha&s;e a ba&s;ket of coal&mdash;one and another, on <HI>that day,</HI> contributed more or le&s;s liberally; and a cheering ray of competency, diffu&s;ing its genial influence over the declining life of poor Ur&s;ula, her heart was made glad.</P>
<P>Thank&s;giving Day is, in our country, a munificent fe&s;tival. It hath, in every view, its beauty and its propriety&mdash;all orders, and every de&s;cription of peo|ple, a&s;&s;emble, to offer up their general acknowledg|ments, and devout ori&s;ons to the Parent of the uni|ver&s;e.

<Q><L>Why is Patronius always in the right?</L>
<L>Is he endow'd with &s;upernatural light?</L>
<L>Certainly not&mdash;but rea&s;on points his way,</L>
<L>And in his brea&s;t her powerful dictates &s;way.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE great &s;ecret of deciding with accuracy, abid|eth in the brea&s;t of deliberation; ha&s;ty conclu|&s;ions mu&s;t ever be hazardous, and a rational man will never &s;ubmit that to chance, which patient and atten|tive inve&s;tigation may reduce to certainty. I have for many years had the felicity of ranking Patronius among my intimate friends; we have lived in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved confidence; and I do not recollect a &s;ingle in&s;tance, wherein he has ever been nece&s;&s;itated to re|tract an opinion which had received publicity from his adoption.</P>
<P>He is never a&s;&s;uming; his &s;entiments are always advanced with mode&s;ty, and by con&s;equence the blu&s;h of error never tinges his cheek. I am aware that this is a high panegyric, but an analytical examination of the &s;y&s;tem of Patronius, will, if I mi&s;take not, evince
<PB N="261" REF="034162_0607_0FFC702015329ED8">
the practicability of a wi&s;e man, whatever may be his internal perceptions, <HI>appearing to ob&s;ervers</HI> always in the right.</P>
<P>It is one of the fir&s;t principles of Patronius, to li&s;ten to the &s;entiments of tho&s;e with whom he a&s;&s;ociates, before he hazards even a conjecture of his own; and as he has an aver&s;ion from controver&s;y, he never ven|tures upon a &s;ubject, except with a view of <HI>giving</HI> or <HI>receiving</HI> information. He is, on no occa&s;ion, the noi&s;y di&s;putant; he will not <HI>contradict peremptorily,</HI> nor a&s;&s;ert <HI>dogmatically;</HI> he does not pre&s;ume that a thing <HI>is, or is not,</HI> preci&s;ely as it happens on a cur&s;ory view to &s;trike his perception. He is a clo&s;e rea&s;oner, <HI>but then he is a rea&s;oner;</HI> his di&s;qui&s;itions are marked with calmne&s;s; and he would prefer remaining &s;ilently attentive during the mo&s;t intere&s;ting conver&s;ation, to the uttering a &s;ingle &s;yllable in favour of an hypothe&s;is which he conceived fal&s;e and untenable. Hence, it will be concluded, that he is much more frequently a hearer than a &s;peaker, and this, indeed, of nece&s;&s;ity happens; yet per&s;ua&s;ion dwells upon his lips, and his opinions are rarely ever a&s;certained, that they are not in&s;tantaneou&s;ly adopted. His character is marked by firmne&s;s; he is known to be con&s;i&s;tently virtuous; and his <HI>movements,</HI> rather than his <HI>language,</HI> are <HI>deci&s;ive.</HI> He is an accurate definer; and when he &s;peaks, &s;ilence, in rapt attention, bends to hear. He propo&s;es his &s;ubject at large; marks, with preci&s;ion, its general contour; expre&s;&s;es tho&s;e ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by an aggre|gate view thereof; and methodically proceeds to indi|vidual ob&s;ervations, from whence he deduces his com|prehen&s;ive and &s;elf-evident conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Truth is the great object of his pur&s;uit; and his re&s;earch after this ine&s;timable gem is uniformly con|ducted with moderation. He is a pupil of the Socra|tic &s;chool; and, by a regular &s;eries of que&s;tions put to his opponent, the invidious ta&s;k of refutation is &s;oft|ened, and his tenets are e&s;tabli&s;hed without involving tho&s;e rancorous feelings which are too commonly the appendages of di&s;putation. By this mild mode of
<PB N="262" REF="034162_0608_0FFC701DB47BFD48">
convincing, Patronius is &s;ure never to offend. Per&s;ons are imperceptibly informed; they admire his under|&s;tanding, without envying its brilliancy; and I have frequently &s;een the brow of this accompli&s;hed victor adorned by the cheerful voices and ready hands of the grateful vanqui&s;hed, with the faire&s;t laurels that ever grew in the aromatic haunts of animating prai&s;e! From interrogatory arguments, Patronius derives an obvious, advantage; he is &s;pared the arrogance of a&s;&s;ertion; conviction is gradually produced; and ev|ery one is ready to join i&s;&s;ue in opinions which become &s;elf-evident, which they have helped to elucidate, and which, with a plea&s;ing per&s;ua&s;ion of their authenticity, pervade the mind. Thus are the feelings of compla|cency invigorated; prejudice imperceptibly undermin|ed; and that pertinacious adherence to a favourite &s;entiment, &s;o natural to human pride, when attacked with le&s;s judgment, &s;kilfully dive&s;ted of its impo&s;ing power. Patronius generally leaves it to his little au|dience, to furni&s;h with the garb of words, the conclu|&s;ion which he has irrefragably demon&s;trated; and hence, &s;hould his rea&s;oning unde&s;ignedly have connect|ed a latent error, he is &s;pared tho&s;e unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;a|tions which would have attended the nece&s;&s;ity of yield|ing his hypothe&s;is, had he propo&s;ed or defended it with ob&s;tinacy: Thus he is a &s;tranger to the <HI>culpability</HI> of error; and my eulogium is, <HI>&s;trictly &s;peaking,</HI> a &s;ober fact&mdash;its <HI>con&s;cious blu&s;hes never ting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his cheek.</HI> I grant that Patronius has been rarely equalled; and that he is placed in our world, a luminary of the fir&s;t magni|tude; and yet, I humbly conceive, I may propo&s;e him as a model for imitation; for although we may never reach the &s;ummit he hath attained, emulation may neverthele&s;s produce its effect; and every advance we make toward the point of rectitude, will be honourable to our&s;elves, and beneficial to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Patronius has the felicity to combine tho&s;e qualities which have been &s;uppo&s;ed heterogeneous; and, while his movements are the re&s;ult of cool deliberation and noble firmne&s;s; while his conduct is under the guid|ance
<PB N="263" REF="034162_0609_0FFC701A55329AF0">
of prudence and propriety, the fervour and con|&s;tancy of his regards amount to the enchanting and amiable enthu&s;ia&s;m, in&s;eparable from &s;ublime and ho|ly friend&s;hip. Patronius evinceth that a &s;trong and well regulated mind is &s;u&s;ceptible of <HI>every excellence;</HI> and his actions may, in the &s;ame moment, be con&s;id|ered as the &s;pontaneous growth of nature, and the re|&s;ult of educated wi&s;dom&mdash;they are rich and abundant|ly productive; they are luxuriant as the wild and in|di&s;criminating impul&s;es of un&s;y&s;tematized liberality: But a <HI>nice</HI> inve&s;tigator will ob&s;erve them carefully pruned by rea&s;on, and circum&s;cribed by the inclo&s;ure of di&s;creet munificence.</P>
<P>I do homage to the active mind of Patronius. In|tellect, it is &s;aid, will always command re&s;pect; and, from full conviction, I receive this &s;entiment into my <HI>trea&s;ury</HI> of <HI>incontrovertible facts.</HI> Will a weight of years de&s;troy the energy of talents &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly em|inent? If it will, we could almo&s;t breathe a wi&s;h to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of time; and with a little variation we apply and devoutly a&s;pirate the Homeric petition in favour of Ne&s;tor; "What now thou art, Oh! ever may&s;t thou be; and age the lot of any &s;age but thee." But the uniform temperance of Patronius, will entitle him to an old age of health; while his mind will continue cheerful and active, pur&s;uing un|interruptedly a cour&s;e of u&s;efulne&s;s to the late&s;t period of his mortal exi&s;tence; thus fini&s;hing his career with tho&s;e meliorated &s;plendors that in the morning of his days &s;hining with &s;trong effulgence, emitted the faire&s;t hopes of meridian excellence. While he lives he will po&s;&s;e&s;s the applau&s;e of his fellow men; and po&s;terity will learn to venerate his memory.</P>
<P>"The applau&s;e of his fellow men!" cries Apathy; "And pray, good Mr. Gleaner, of what u&s;e will this be to Patronius? Plea&s;e to inform us to what the ap|plau&s;e of his fellow men will amount? Fame is a wind blown vagabond; &s;he delighteth not in durable habi|tations. <HI>Virtue, in the per&s;on of WASHINGTON, hath en|deavoured to render her &s;tationary;</HI> but the flood of light

with which &s;he hath encompa&s;&s;ed the hero, hath at length become in&s;ufferable; it hath &s;truck blind a number of well meaning individuals; and it hath &s;o far excited the rancour of the &s;creech-owls of our day, that, if the guardian chief &s;hould not &s;uddenly e&s;cape to his native &s;kies, it will be wonderful if they do not for the time being; envelop him in that den&s;e atmo&s;|phere which circum&s;cribes their own ideas; it will be a&s;toni&s;hing, if, encircling him by the murky clouds of envy, they do not de&s;poil him of the vagrant fame. Yet, lured by the charms of a conduct irreproachable, &s;hould fame continue to enwreath <HI>the honoured brows of Wa&s;hington,</HI> as worth &s;o rare is &s;eldom the growth of mortality, preten&s;ions more equivocal mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the veil of ob&s;curity, or con&s;ent to become the &s;port of alternate cen&s;ure and applau&s;e. Prai&s;e is an airy com|modity; a breath be&s;tows it, and a breath retracts; it &s;oothes for a moment, but it &s;oon evaporates; it ener|vates the mind, in&s;inuating a per&s;ua&s;ion, that, having reached the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of intellectual attainments, every future effort is &s;uperfluous, and it renders us im|patient under the mo&s;t gentle and nece&s;&s;ary reproofs. For my part, although I may admire your Patronius, I neverthele&s;s throw my gauntlet, and po&s;itively a&s;|&s;ert the inutility of every &s;pecies of commendation; being fully able to prove its inability to confer happi|ne&s;s, and its inefficacy on the morals of mankind. He who expects his peace from the eulogizing voice of fame, is making his couch on the pointed thorns of ca|price&mdash;is building a &s;uper&s;tructure on the fluctuating waves of opinion, than which nothing is more futile and un&s;table. I tru&s;t not then the treachery of &s;enti|ment, the bubble fame is not an object of my pur&s;uit; and I am regardle&s;s of the opinion of the world."</P>
<P>Stop, &s;top, Mr. Apathy&mdash;attend a moment, if you plea&s;e. The world is a va&s;t, an ample theatre, and its inhabitants are an audience to each other&mdash;we are alternately actors and &s;pectators; and, if we hold in contempt the opinion of tho&s;e who are a&s;&s;embled as our judges, the probability is, we &s;hall &s;oon view with

indifference tho&s;e virtues, the attainment and practice of which, is the purcha&s;e of their e&s;teem; and it is to be feared we &s;hall ultimately become unworthy of the good we have learned to de&s;pi&s;e. I &s;hould trem|ble for a &s;on or daughter who regarded with indiffer|ence the &s;acred intere&s;ts of reputation. To what pur|po&s;e are we diligently employed in embelli&s;hing our per&s;ons, or in poli&s;hing our manners? the&s;e adventi|tious graces make no <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> part of inborn integrity, or of a &s;olid under&s;tanding; yet, they are plea&s;ing ex|teriors, which render us acceptable to tho&s;e with whom we a&s;&s;ociate. But, was there no individual whom we wi&s;hed to impre&s;s&mdash;was there no heart, on who&s;e fair tablets we were anxious to &s;tamp ideas of our merit, the&s;e external ornaments would, perhaps, be but little &s;tudied; nay, in defiance of cu&s;tom it&s;elf, the probabili|ty is, they would gradually be totally laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Sir, I &s;ay again, I regard not the opinion of the world; my period of emancipation has arrived, and I, at length, feel my&s;elf &s;uperior to its cen&s;ures or its applau&s;es.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Alas! alas! Mr. Apathy, you have then lo&s;t an admirable incentive to con&s;i&s;tent rectitude, and you have but one &s;tep further to go&mdash;you have only to throw off tho&s;e feelings of re&s;traint, which have hith|erto influenced you, in regard to that all-pervading Being, who created the world and tho&s;e intelligencies whom you now &s;o heroically de&s;pi&s;e&mdash;you have only to leap this barrier, and you rank with the four-footed tenants of the &s;oil! your fears and your expectations are, like theirs, bounded by the gratification of the mo|ment. To the duration of communicable good, you are a &s;tranger; for you cannot participate the enjoy|ments of tho&s;e, whom you contemplate with &s;uch un|feigned and &s;y&s;tematic contempt.</P>
<P>But, as I would hope this globe, in its exten&s;ive round, contains not the human being, who is, in his heart, at all times, and upon every occa&s;ion, an unwa|vering Athei&s;t; &s;o I plea&s;ingly believe, that there exi&s;ts not a rationally intelligent man, or woman, who is not

<P>The Gleaner, &s;olicitous to cultivate the good and amiable qualities of his readers, would endow them with that delicacy which trembles at the voice of ac|cu&s;ation, and which, enwrapping it&s;elf in the mantle of propriety, is &s;edulou&s;ly careful to avoid even the &s;hadow of &s;u&s;picion.

<P>"Mamma," &s;aid my little grand-daughter to Mar|garetta, "Mamma, where do butterflies go?" I re|peat, that a child may a&s;k a que&s;tion which would puzzle a Sir I&s;aac Newton to re&s;olve. But although neither the wi&s;e nor the untaught may be able to de&s;|cant <HI>learnedly</HI> on the de&s;tination of butterflies, yet do we take inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure in tracing their various and &s;urpri&s;ing tran&s;mutations, and in dwelling with eager attention on their eventful career, until, borne on the gentle zephyr, they become tenants of the a&euml;rial world.</P>
<P>May not the butterfly be con&s;idered as a humble figure of the creature Man? In its reptile &s;tate it &s;eems fa&s;tened to the earth; it is indefatigable in its attempts to obtain that &s;ub&s;i&s;tence it will need but a little while. At length it is evidently on the decay; it &s;ets about preparing for its departure; it makes ready the filaments in which it enwrappeth it&s;elf; it enfolds and contracts them; gradually they become a &s;epulchral cru&s;t, in which &s;ecurely enveloped, the de|cea&s;ed in&s;ect <HI>apparently bids a final adieu</HI> to the bu&s;y &s;cenes in which it hath taken &s;o laborious a part. But mark the a&s;toni&s;hing change: The&s;e habiliments of death are thrown off&mdash;the hideou&s;ly di&s;gu&s;ting form is no more&mdash;its newly acquired wings are expanded&mdash;they a&s;&s;ume a variety of hues, and look as if de&s;igned in the gaye&s;t moments of a fertile and brilliant imag|ination. Hardly will the little flutterer deign to re&s;t on the bo&s;om of that earth, to which it formerly &s;o clo&s;ely adhered; and, perched on &s;ome beauteou&s;ly fragrant flower, and indulging in all the rich variety of ambro&s;ial food, it &s;ips the embo&s;omed &s;weets. With what a&s;toni&s;hing celerity its movements are per|formed&mdash;lightly it pur&s;ues its elevated path, and we

gaze with admiration upon its wonderful improve|ments. Was not the whole proce&s;s &s;ubmitted to our ob&s;ervation, we &s;hould call in que&s;tion its reality; and cold philo&s;ophy would teach us, fir&s;t, to rea&s;on&mdash;&s;econd|ly, to doubt&mdash;and, finally, to embrace the creed of infi|delity.</P>
<P>Man, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of being, moves heavily on this opaque globe&mdash;he is principally &s;olicitous, re&s;pect|ing matters which appertain wholly to this life&mdash;he is often anxiou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed, while every acce&s;&s;ion to that property he is carefully &s;eeking to augment, does but increa&s;e his burdens. But whatever impediments may &s;eem to bar his way, he, however, advances on|ward&mdash;he attains the period when his quick &s;en&s;e of earth-born joys is no more&mdash;he verges on the days on which he can &s;ay he hath no plea&s;ure&mdash;for a little mo|ment he abides, and his open grave is prepared&mdash;he is inclo&s;ed in the narrow hou&s;e, and the green turf clothes, with undi&s;tingui&s;hing verdure, the hallowed &s;pot where he repo&s;es. Do we &s;ay that we have bid him an eternal adieu? we do not &s;peak correctly; for, in the morning of the re&s;urrection, he &s;hall bur&s;t the bar|riers of the grave&mdash;he &s;hall i&s;&s;ue from the chambers of the tomb. Behold how mortality hath put on immor|tality&mdash;he is beautiful as the inhabitants of the cele&s;|tial world&mdash;he hath become as a winged &s;eraph&mdash;he mounts, he &s;oars on high&mdash;he pur&s;ues his trackle&s;s way&mdash;he attains the heaven of heavens, and he min|gles with the angels who &s;urround the throne of Deity.</P>
<P>Is my figure exceptionable?&mdash;I &s;hall not contend&mdash;I did not expect it would an&s;wer in all its parts. I think, however, &s;ome of its features will be acknowl|edged &s;triking; and I could as ea&s;ily, had I not ocu|lar demon&s;tration, believe the re&s;urrection of the body, inclo&s;ed in yonder tomb, as I could lend my credence to the egg, the worm, the cone, the aurelia, and the butterfly.</P>
<P>Yet, I do not vehemently in&s;i&s;t on the re&s;u&s;citation of this time-worn tenement. In the bloom of youth, and vigour of my days, my reluctance to a final &s;epa|ration

from organs &s;o incomparably well adapted to my exigencies, was extreme; but a length of years have revolved&mdash;the fine machine is going to decay&mdash;I begin to detect its inconveniences&mdash;it is a heavy clog upon my purpo&s;es&mdash;and, when I am bounding for|ward with all the celerity of thought, I am retarded and pulled back by its unwieldy properties. I natur|ally wi&s;h for a vehicle more agile; and imagination, darting into futurity, anticipates accommodations more con&s;onant with my wi&s;hes. Hardly a day pa&s;&s;es, in which I do not di&s;cover, in my pre&s;ent re&s;idence, new in&s;tances to prove that the building is greatly im|paired; nor is this a circum&s;tance of regret. My gla&s;s informs me, that time hath furrowed my face; that my eyes no longer &s;parkle with the vivacity of youth; that the glo&s;&s;y ornaments of my head are rap|idly giving place; that my form is bent; that I hob|ble in my gait, &amp;c. &amp;c. No matter&mdash;my attachment to this earthly re&s;idence is al&s;o on the decline, and I will &s;upport, with fortitude, the &s;ufferings which may be nece&s;&s;ary to its di&s;&s;olution. Whether my all-wi&s;e and omnific Father will rai&s;e it again on a nobler principle, is a que&s;tion that cannot greatly agitate my mind, &s;ince I know that his paternal goodne&s;s will or|dain for me, preci&s;ely that habitation, which &s;hall be the be&s;t calculated for the full enjoyment of all my faculties. If I&mdash;if my be&s;t &s;elf can e&s;cape from this wreck of nature, I am then &s;ure to be as "<HI>ble&s;t as I can hear;</HI>" and, the <HI>&s;uperiority</HI> and <HI>inferred durability</HI> of &s;pirit, is beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>"Certainly not," cries the oppo&s;er, <Q><HI>for the mental</HI> faculties decay with the corporeal; <HI>thus evincing the truth of the hypothe&s;is, which de&s;cribes them as both per|i&s;hing together.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But again&s;t &s;uch a comfortle&s;s and derogatory &s;en|timent I enter my prote&s;t. The immortal principle of life, retaining, <HI>in this debilitated body,</HI> its pri&s;tine vig|our, glows indignant at the humiliating idea; and, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>decaying organs by which it operates,</HI> it &s;till a&s;&s;erts its own inherent fervours. <HI>Age</HI> cannot,

From the mo|ment in which the immortal mind becomes a &s;ojourner in mortality, certain organs, by which it is to operate, are a&s;&s;igned to the cele&s;tial re&s;ident, and the&s;e organs become the medium of its manife&s;tations. In infancy the mental faculties are under a nece&s;&s;ity of awaiting the acquirements of that progre&s;&s;ing machine, in which they are enveloped; and the rea&s;on is obvious; the mo&s;t &s;kilful arti&s;t mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with in&s;truments proper to his occupation. In the vigour of manhood the &s;oul &s;till finds many a laudable wi&s;h ungratified&mdash;its habitation is not in every re&s;pect accommodated to its views&mdash;it would move with all the rapidity of mo|tion&mdash;it would take the wings of the morning, and compa&s;s the globe in a day&mdash;it would de&s;ign and exe|cute in one and the &s;ame moment&mdash;and the re&s;tle&s;s anxiety it experienceth is a pre&s;umptive proof, that it is appointed to a higher and more perfect &s;tate. Old age arrives&mdash;and the <HI>bodily organs, ordained for di&s;&s;olution, experienceth the imbecility that marked the &s;tate of child|hood</HI>&mdash;the impri&s;oned &s;pirit a&s;&s;ays to quicken the &s;lug|gi&s;h &s;tream&mdash;it endeavours to rou&s;e the torpid pul&s;e&mdash;it would render flexile the &s;tiffening &s;inews&mdash;with tremulous anxiety it &s;earches every compartment, throws its inquiring glance through each avenue, and would act upon the complicated machine as in tho&s;e days when it appeared &s;o much under its command&mdash;but it will not be&mdash;and it is in vain to &s;truggle again&s;t a &s;tatute which hath pa&s;&s;ed the great &s;eal of Heaven. The retiring immortal at length becomes con&s;cious that it is on the eve of its departure; it collects its &s;cattered faculties, and, &s;ubmitting to that &s;tate which bears a &s;trong re&s;emblance to inactivity, and which is impo&s;ed by nece&s;&s;ity, it awaits, with more or le&s;s re&s;ig|nation, the approaching moment of its final emanci|pation. But &s;hall we for this expatiate on its dimin|i&s;hed lu&s;tre, &s;trip it of its immortality, prepare its fu|neral dirge, and con&s;ign it to the gulph of oblivion?

Strange perver&s;ion of ideas! mo&s;t illogical conclu&s;ion! and truly unworthy &s;acrifice of all tho&s;e commanding incentives to virtue and &s;plendid hopes, that originate in an expectation of future exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>That it is highly irrational to characterize the im|mortal mind, from the <HI>demon&s;tration</HI> it maketh of its faculties by the medium of <HI>decaying bodily organs,</HI> is apparent from a variety of con&s;iderations.

<P>"Mi&s;taken man," replies the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, "your conjecture is erroneous; nothing can be fur|ther from the truth. <HI>The in&s;trument, my good Sir, is out of tune; nay, more, an accident hath de&s;poiled it of its principal keys; the complicated machinery is ob&s;tructed in its mo&s;t capital parts; in &s;hort, it is worn out by time, di&s;a&s;trous removals, and un&s;kilful u&s;age.</HI>" Ought I not to feel con&s;cious of my injurious e&s;timation of the mu|&s;ician?

made on this &s;ubject, I have derived much con&s;olation, from recurring to the &s;urpri&s;ing activity the &s;pirit of|ten evinces, when the bodily organs are fa&s;t locked in the embraces of the <HI>image</HI> of <HI>death.</HI> I have thought, that the action of the &s;pirit is in no moment <HI>entirely &s;u&s;pended;</HI> and although I have pa&s;&s;ed many nights without a <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of having dreamed, yet it does not therefore follow, that the mental faculties have been unemployed. The mo&s;t plea&s;ing vi&s;ions have &s;ometimes gathered round my &s;leeping hours; meth|od and propriety have been in full exerci&s;e; but when the re-action of the corporeal organs has re-called the vagrant &s;pirit, only di&s;jointed images have remain|ed, and it has been beyond my power to recover a &s;in|gle connected idea. Again, I have only been able to recollect that I <HI>have dreamed,</HI> without the ve&s;tige of an impre&s;&s;ion, by which I could trace the nature of the vi&s;ion. From the&s;e facts I gather, that I may dream without being at all con&s;cious, after the &s;hadows of the night have fled, that my mind has been thus occu|pied. It appears to me of con&s;equence, to e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>con&s;tant activity</HI> of the &s;oul; for, if it can, for a &s;ingle moment, be dive&s;ted of its con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and the appendages of animation; if it can <HI>&s;lumber with the body,</HI> it may &s;lumber for ages, it may lo&s;e its identity, it may &s;ink into oblivion; and we are, by con&s;equence, conducted to the comfortle&s;s verge of materiali&s;m! But having expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf freely on this &s;ubject in an E&s;&s;ay, which may in future be &s;ubmitted to the public eye, I wave it for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I know that dreams are whim&s;ical, perplexing and fallacious; yet we do not always under&s;tand their ori|gin or tendency; and, I conceive, there may be anal|ogies in nature, of which we are entirely ignorant.

But alas! the fleeting vi&s;ion is on the wing&mdash;a creaking door&mdash;an impertinent foot&s;tep&mdash;the charm is broken&mdash;and the mind is again embodied by age, infirmity, and con&s;e|quent &s;uffering.

<P>But it is &s;aid, that we vainly deduce a proof of the immortality of the &s;oul from dreams, &s;ince there are exi&s;ting many &s;trong rea&s;ons to &s;uppo&s;e, that dogs and &s;everal other animals dream.

<P>PERHAPS there is no individual, who is impre&s;&s;|ed with a higher idea of the advantages re&s;ulting from exten&s;ive literature, than my&s;elf.

He who has neglected to &s;tore his mind with ideas, to invigorate the intellectual powers, and to habituate him&s;elf to rea&s;oning, comparing, inve&s;tigat|ing, and concluding, hath not only forgotten to con|&s;titute a fund on which he might occa&s;ionally draw, but hath al&s;o defrauded &s;ociety of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which mankind had a right to reckon on from his abilities; and thus committed a crime again&s;t his &s;pecies, for which, alas! it is beyond his power to atone.</P>
<P>But while I deliberately render all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect to tho&s;e acquirements, &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite to him who would run with honour the career of life, I can|not forbear confe&s;&s;ing my <HI>&s;uperior admiration</HI> of tho&s;e fortuitous candidates for applau&s;e, who, in a great mea&s;ure una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;chools, have reached the highe&s;t eminence to which a human being can a&s;pire; nor does this dimini&s;h the odium &s;o ju&s;tly affixed up|on him, who, inattentive to the means of information with which he has been furni&s;hed, produces him&s;elf upon the world an unlettered blank, waiting the ca&s;|ual impre&s;&s;ions of every intere&s;ted compo&s;itor, whom chance may direct to fill up the vacant pages.</P>

But circum&s;tances may have combined to deny the means of in&s;truction; and the proprietor of genius may pa&s;s tho&s;e years when he &s;hould have been entered and continued the pupil of &s;cience, without receiving tho&s;e adventitious aids, which, with lapidarian influence, would have given to acknowledged merit the mo&s;t brilliant poli&s;h; and if under a predicament unque&s;|tionably di&s;advantageous, he attains to eminence, if although unfa&s;hioned by the cultivating hand of a preceptor, he bur&s;ts through tho&s;e intercepting clouds in which a variety of unpropitious arrangements had enveloped the morning of his days, and, rich in native re&s;ources, blazes forth in meridian lu&s;tre, we &s;urely can|not he&s;itate to &s;ub&s;cribe to the ju&s;tice of that deci&s;ion, which, eternizing his name, inve&s;ts him with immor|tality. It is true he will not combine the learning of a John&s;on; his diction may be neither elegant nor correct; he will be in the &s;ituation of a man who has to &s;hape his materials, as well as to con&s;truct his pile of building; but he may &s;trike out &s;ome bold originalities, his &s;uper&s;tructure may po&s;&s;ibly create a new order in literature, and he may form very ju&s;t preten&s;ions to rank with tho&s;e venerable ancients who have, through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the admiration of mankind.

Had Grammatica&s;ter lived in the days of Shake|&s;pear, he would undoubtedly have attacked, with true Zoiluan rancour, the &s;plendid Bard of Nature. The <HI>two Witches &s;olus,</HI> which Shake&s;pear is &s;aid to have introduced, would have excited his mo&s;t &s;plenetic indignation; and he would have &s;ought out, with in|defatigable avidity and wonderful ingenuity, tho&s;e bagatelle, denominated defects, thence <HI>deci&s;ively</HI> pro|nouncing the divine poet of Avon wholly de&s;titute of merit of every de&s;cription.

<P>The conduct of the admirer of Shake&s;perian worth, or, in other words, of him who is capable of viewing with a &s;teady eye the luminous path of genius, is the rever&s;e of this.

An accident, however, of a dark and unwarrantable hue, appears to be the procuring cau&s;e which unexpectedly engages him in the mo&s;t arduous pur&s;uits; and the&s;e preced|ing facts will augment the a&s;toni&s;hment and admira|tion of all tho&s;e who candidly reflect upon his &s;ub&s;e|quent achievements, and upon the unequalled elevation to which he &s;oared; they will operate as a &s;ponge, which will, <HI>in effect,</HI> era&s;e from his pages all tho&s;e pec|cadillos, that in an author receiving a regular educa|tion

<P>As the &s;atellite of Mi&s;s Moore, the milk woman mu&s;t &s;till be con&s;idered; and, if it is true that an adver&s;e cloud hath for a time intercepted the beneficent rays of that re&s;plendent orb, preventing the continuance of their genial influence on the humble daughter of ge|nius, the innate refulgence of an intellect, both elevat|ed and informed, will undoubtedly con&s;ume every opaque impediment which hath officiou&s;ly obtruded; and &s;he will once more receive to favour the gentle female whom &s;he hath pre&s;ented to ob&s;ervation, and whom &s;he &s;o kindly &s;heltered.</P>
<P>Woodhou&s;e, the Cri&s;pian bard, extorts our pity and our admiration: Like the milk woman, common read|ing and writing comprized the whole of his educa|tion; and, from an application to even the&s;e u&s;eful branches of &s;tudy, he was taken when he was only &s;ev|en years of age. Perhaps Mi&s;s Moore's account of Mrs. Year&s;ley, might be &s;trictly applied to Woodhou&s;e; but, be this as it may, he was, however, bred a &s;hoe|maker, at which bu&s;ine&s;s, he was no more than a journeyman, and condemned to labour with indefati|gable

indu&s;try, for the &s;upport of a beloved wife, and an infant progeny. We cannot but venerate both his genius and application; while we view him &s;eated at his depre&s;&s;ing employ, the pen and ink are at his el|bow; he arre&s;ts the couplets as they pre&s;ent, and, penning them down for future revi&s;ion, he again pur|&s;ues the duties of his occupation. Of his thir&s;t for knowledge, we receive a very high idea, when we contemplate him after a day pa&s;&s;ed in earning the &s;canty pittance adjudged the price of his labour, ap|propriating tho&s;e hours u&s;ually devoted to the re&s;tora|tive &s;lumbers of the night, to the obtaining that intel|lectual food, fortunately &s;o amply &s;upplied by books, with which the indulgence of his patron at length furni&s;hed him; and we yield him our full commi&s;era|tion, when we hear him in his poem, entitled Spring, pen&s;ively complain, not indeed &s;o much for him&s;elf, as for the beauteous fair one who&s;e fate was entwined with his. The circum&s;tances and &s;canty advantages of the poet, induces us to allow to his lays their <HI>full merit; and the invidious attempt to point out a blemi&s;h,</HI> would &s;eem to connect a degree of criminality. Thus thought the elegant bard of the Lea&s;owes, when, with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, and a benevolence truly charac|teri&s;tic, he commended, &s;anctioned and patronized; while his dignified conde&s;cen&s;ion was only equalled by the gratitude of Cri&s;pin, who was ambitious of elevating almo&s;t every poetical e&s;&s;ay, by the admired name of Shen&s;tone.</P>
<P>Imagination, when tracing the progre&s;s of genius, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by education, nece&s;&s;arily &s;tops to drop a tear of regret over the misfortunes, and to render the tribute of applau&s;e, indi&s;putably due to the merit and &s;ublime genius of Chatterton. Uncommon youth! with what facility did he arre&s;t and annex whatever could enrich and embelli&s;h; and how wonderful was the progre&s;s of this untutored bard! Excellent young man! de|frauded, whil&s;t thou &s;ojourned among mortals, of whatever could &s;oothe, invigorate, or &s;u&s;tain; thy ex|i&s;tence became the forfeit! and nought, alas! remains

<P>But the efforts of genius, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by education, are alike entitled to &s;uperior panegyric, whatever track it may pur&s;ue. To the natural powers of a Brindley, the celebrated projector of navigable canals we do reverence; and, while we envy the felicity of the Duke of Bridgewater, who fir&s;t called into action talents, &s;o inherently energetic, we unhe&s;itatingly confe&s;s that the total ignorance of art which Mr. Brindley evinced, while &s;ubmitting to the inve&s;tigating interrogations of the Hou&s;e of Commons, renders &s;till more con&s;picuous the magnitude of his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The contemplation of the powers of nature, is, undoubtedly, a delightful employ: <HI>Native</HI> talent in|ve&s;ts with <HI>independent</HI> lu&s;tre; and every in&s;tance of <HI>unaided excellence,</HI> &s;tamps an idea of the <HI>inherent value of intellect.</HI> Mankind are proportionably dignified, as the <HI>inborn worth</HI> of that cele&s;tial emanation, which animates them to action, is acknowledged and e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, impre&s;&s;ed with this &s;entiment, I am free to own, that I trace with &s;ingular &s;atisfaction, the brilliant efforts of untaught abilities, warmed to admiration and &s;tim|ulated to exertion by the unborrowed rays which they emit; I love to ba&s;k beneath the genial beam; and I hoard, with all a mi&s;er's indu&s;try, the golden trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>KULIBIA, a Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ant, commemorated in Cox's travels, is a rich in&s;tance of the wonderful powers of nature; he will ever be grouped with examples of ex|traordinary genius; and the bridge, thrown over the river Neva, which he projected, with many other achievements of his <HI>untutored</HI> abilities, will continue to bear te&s;timony to the &s;ublimity of his intellect.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of neglected education hath been the ground, on which the &s;uper&s;tructure of female abil|ities hath been reared; it hath inve&s;ted women of elevated under&s;tanding with an indi&s;putable claim to <HI>&s;uperior</HI> e&s;timation; for when &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;truggling with tho&s;e di&s;couragements which are peculiarly &s;exual;

But the apology for female deficiencies, furni&s;hed by want of education, will not, in future, be acknowledged as valid; the partial di&s;tribution of advantages which has too long obtained, is, in this enlightened age, rapidly giving place to a more uniform &s;y&s;tem of information; and the frequently conte&s;ted que&s;tion, re&s;pecting the intellectual preten&s;ions of the &s;exes, may one day be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed on fair and equal ground.</P>
<P>In the family of Alexy Michaelovitch, Czar of Ru&s;&s;ia, a &s;triking in&s;tance is recorded where &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding &s;hone forth with decided brilliancy in the female line. Feodor and Ivan, &s;ons of the Czar, evinced in every particular a marked inferiority of intellect, while their &s;i&s;ter, the Prince&s;s Sophia, was endowed by nature with all tho&s;e &s;hining talents, and that &s;olidity of under&s;tanding in which her brothers were &s;o remarkably deficient. Eminently qualified for her high &s;tation; although a woman of uncommon beauty of per&s;on, &s;he combined therewith fir&s;t rate abilities. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an extraordinary knowledge in the theory of government; and &s;he knew how to reduce to practice its true &s;pirit. Of per&s;ons of genius and learning &s;he was the avowed and liberal patrone&s;s; and the introduction of polite literature into Europe, was encouraged and &s;anctioned by her example. At an era when the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of compo&s;ition both a&s;&s;umed and di&s;graced the name of morality, this elegant prince&s;s occupied her lei&s;ure hours in tran&s;la|ting the Medicin Malgrelui of Moliere. She al&s;o compo&s;ed a tragedy, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fir&s;t extant in the Ru&s;&s;ian language; and a circum&s;tance which adds e&s;&s;entially to the merit of this e&s;&s;ay, is, that it was

<P>A &s;en&s;ation of painful and in&s;urmountable di&s;gu&s;t has &s;ometimes arre&s;ted my perception, when I have made one in the drawing-room of an imperious wom|an, who&s;e awkward efforts to a&s;&s;ume that dignity which is never annexed to affectation, have rendered her truly ridiculous.

adverted to; and at her appearance the mo&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;ations ru&s;h upon the mind. The la|dy of the drawing room advances a few &s;teps, then recedes back, <HI>&s;tands erect, courte&s;ies formally, looks for|bidding, and a&s;&s;umes, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, airs of importance;</HI> while, in the e&s;timation of rea&s;on, &s;he is only giving an exhibition of <HI>in&s;ufferable haughtine&s;s.</HI> In the mean time, the lovely maiden (perhaps in &s;ome way a de|pendant) is aba&s;hed at a reception &s;o little corre&s;pond|ent with her wi&s;hes. Of her want of con&s;equence, and the invidious triumph of the lady, there are many witne&s;&s;es; &s;he is covered with blu&s;hes; &s;he &s;eems to &s;hrink into her&s;elf; confu&s;ed and di&s;compo&s;ed, &s;he ha&s;tens to a &s;eat; and, dive&s;ted of that innate compla|cency which true politene&s;s is &s;olicitous to cheri&s;h, &s;he li&s;tens in &s;ilence during the continuance of her ill-fated vi&s;it, to a redundance of non&s;en&s;e, di&s;&s;ertations on fa&s;hion, and refinements on &s;candal.</P>

<P>The celebrated Mrs. Wright, introduced by her un|common talents to a per&s;onal knowledge of the nobil|ity and gentry of the kingdom of England, had, dur|ing her re&s;idence in that country, an opportunity of
<PB N="283" REF="034162_0629_0FFC6FECF92D0238">
making many characteri&s;tic ob&s;ervations; and, in one of her letters, &s;he humorou&s;ly contra&s;ts the manners of the woman well educated, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing habitual and <HI>real &s;uperiority,</HI> with tho&s;e of a female, conducted by a variety of fortuitous events to move in a &s;phere for which neither her natural nor acquired abilities had qualified her. Mrs. Wright devoted a fine winter morning to calling <HI>en pa&s;&s;ent</HI> on &s;everal of her patrons; and among the number of tho&s;e whom &s;he attended, and who were ambitious of obtaining celebrity, by in|&s;erting in their li&s;t of acquaintance the votaries of ge|nius, was the lady of a baronet, who had been rai&s;ed from ob&s;curity, to <HI>all</HI> the privileges annexed to rank and title.</P>
<P>In the &s;uperb man&s;ion of this <HI>chance created lady,</HI> Mrs. Wright, after &s;ending up her name, was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting a tedious interval; and, al|though the chilly bla&s;ts of December were abroad, no genial blaze decorated, by its cheering flame, the gloomy chimney! It is true the elegant apartment, in which &s;he waited the convenience of <HI>the lady,</HI> was or|mented in high ta&s;te; but this circum&s;tance did not po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ufficient intere&s;t in the bo&s;om of Mrs. Wright to charm her &s;en&s;e of &s;uffering; and &s;he regarded the &s;ummons, which admitted her to the pre&s;ence of the proprietre&s;s of the man&s;ion, as an emancipation from a very unplea&s;ant &s;ituation. The reception &s;he obtain|ed, was, however, not more to her ta&s;te. <HI>The lady</HI> a&s;|&s;umed the mo&s;t petrifying airs of &s;uperiority; and both her language and her manner were cold as the icy breath of the northern tempe&s;t: But Mrs. Wright, having the addre&s;s to curtail her vi&s;it, hurried away to lady N&mdash;, at who&s;e toilette, <HI>&s;an ceremonie,</HI> &s;he was immediately admitted, and in&s;tantly engaged in that plea&s;ing interchange of civilities, which &s;o frequently marks a female <HI>tete-a-tete.</HI> Lady N&mdash;chatted fa|miliarly; &s;oothed the &s;elf complacency of our Ameri|can adventurer, by eulogizing the art in which &s;he con|templated future eminence; and, after completing the labours of the toilette, agreeably to a previous appoint|ment,
<PB N="284" REF="034162_0630_0FFC6FE9E14DC1C0">
accompanied her to the royal pre&s;ence; and the benign conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Briti&s;h queen, was evinced by &s;till higher demon&s;trations of affability, than tho&s;e which had graced the manners of lady N&mdash;.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wright, penetrated with the mo&s;t lively grati|tude, &s;et no bounds to her joy or her admiration; and, after narrating the particulars of this interview, &s;he ob&s;erved, that in exact ratio as &s;he approached the lib|eral and &s;plendid &s;ource of genuine magnificence, the mild regency of urbanity became more &s;trikingly ap|parent.</P>
<P>Thus the orb of day, with regular munificence, dif|fu&s;eth over the globe its genial influence; while the glow-worm &s;parkles only for tho&s;e who take their &s;ta|tion within its narrow limits.</P>
<P>From a gentleman intimately conver&s;ant with Mrs. Wright, I have been furni&s;hed with &s;ome anecdotes relative to this extraordinary woman, which, as their authenticity is unque&s;tionable, I &s;hall pre&s;ent, as a bi|ographical &s;ketch, that I pre&s;ume will not be altogeth|er unintere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wright was a branch of a family, re&s;iding in Cro&s;&s;wicks, in the Jer&s;ies, of ob&s;cure extraction, and humble circum&s;tances; but remarkable for the pecu|liarities, which di&s;tingui&s;hed its individuals. Of her father, Mr. Lovel, many &s;ingularities are narrated; but, as it appears that his life was unoffending, he had a right to the indulgence of his innocent caprices. After his demi&s;e, his elde&s;t &s;on determined to erect for him&s;elf a dwelling, agreeably to the fa&s;hion of his own ideas; and he combined with this re&s;olution the ex|traordinary ambition of preparing the materials with his own hands. He not only de&s;igned, but executed; and, both the tenement and its furniture were the pro|duction of his ingenious indu&s;try, while every article evinced the &s;kill of a ma&s;ter! He next con&s;tructed a &s;pinnet, from which, <HI>&s;elf taught,</HI> he drew &s;uch tones, as are not often &s;urpa&s;&s;ed. The violin, too, became &s;ub|ject to the ver&s;atility of his genius; and he both made
<PB N="285" REF="034162_0631_0FFC6FE85A13DF70">
that plea&s;ing in&s;trument, and executed thereon the mo&s;t exten&s;ive compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>It appears, that either from want of ability or in|clination, Mr. Lovel, the old gentleman, had not been over &s;olicitous re&s;pecting the education of his children. Mrs. Wright was apprenticed to a mantua maker, with whom &s;he continued, until &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of her bu&s;ine&s;s. She formed her matrimonial connexion early in life, which connexion was unhappy; and her little family drew their whole &s;upport from her indu&s;|trious application. But, although her conduct during this part of her life was truly meritorious, yet, as her exertions were apparently the re&s;ult of nece&s;&s;ity, they did not pointedly evince tho&s;e remarkable talents, which eventually produced her in the fir&s;t circles in the me|tropolis of England; nor did the demi&s;e of Mr. Wright produce an immediate change in her arrangements&mdash;the mantua making bu&s;ine&s;s &s;till afforded her a kind of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence&mdash;her week's work procured her week's &s;upport, and her hours revolved in their accu&s;tomed routine, until an accident, rendered important by its con&s;equences, originated a &s;urpri&s;ing revolution. A woman, offering wax figures for &s;ale, &s;topped at her door; when Mrs. Wright, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a large &s;hare of that curio&s;ity in&s;eparable from &s;uperior abilities, que&s;|tioned her relative to the compo&s;ition of her commodi|ties; and, for a &s;mall con&s;ideration, obtained that infor|mation which proved to her the &s;ource of uncommon celebrity, and great pecuniary emolument. The cele&s;|tial &s;park of genius, &s;o long dormant, was in&s;tantly blown into a flame; and, immediately throwing up her bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he became the ingenious fabricator of a new and a&s;toni&s;hing creation! Her &s;ucce&s;s was be|yond her mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations: from fancy fig|ures, &s;he proceeded to particular re&s;emblances; and from her fa&s;hioning fingers grew the mo&s;t fini&s;hed likene&s;&s;es. General admiration was excited, and the gratitude of tho&s;e, who beheld exact tran&s;cripts of their beloved connexions thus multiplied and perpetuated, knew no bounds.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="034162_0632_0FFC6FE6D365E970">
Bordentown, where &s;he had re&s;ided during her mar|riage, &s;oon became too narrow a field for the di&s;play of talents &s;o rare, and &s;he removed to the city of New-York, where &s;he advanced rapidly in the career of fame! She &s;oon furni&s;hed a &s;pacious apartment with her figures, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t celebrated per|&s;onages, in &s;acred and &s;ecular hi&s;tory, a&s;&s;ociated with re&s;pectable moderns, and beings, copied from her own imagination. By the liberality of her patrons, &s;he was amply &s;upplied with the nece&s;&s;ary dre&s;&s;es, and her rooms became the re&s;ort of the curious, the gay, and the idle. Her next attempt was painting; and her e&s;&s;ays, in this elegant art were by no means de&s;titute of merit. Among other performances, &s;he painted a miniature of Governor Tryon, which was e&s;teemed an admirable likene&s;s. Thus, uncommonly qualified by the liberal hand of nature, the orbit of this younger world being judged a &s;phere too contracted for abili|ties &s;o &s;plendid, &s;he was encouraged to cro&s;s the Atlan|tic; and, furni&s;hed with letters to Doctor Franklin, then re&s;ident in England, and many other re&s;pectable characters, &s;he bent her cour&s;e over the great waters, taking with her &s;ome of her mo&s;t capital pieces, as &s;pecimens of her abilities. Governor Tryon enclo&s;ed, by Mrs. Wright, the miniature &s;he had painted, as a pre&s;ent to his &s;i&s;ter, then maid of honour; this proved a mo&s;t happy introduction. The lady, charmed with the accuracy of the &s;imilitude, was proportionably plea&s;ed with the in&s;trument; and it is hardly nece&s;|&s;ary to add, that her good offices were, from that mo|ment &s;ecured. The protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Doctor Franklin was in cour&s;e, and the nobility and gentry, of every de&s;cription, were numbered as her patrons. To her American collection of illu&s;trious per&s;onages, &s;he added, while in England, the mo&s;t celebrated char|acters of that nation. Even their maje&s;ties &s;ubmitted their heads to the proce&s;s of her art, and a ju&s;t tribute of applau&s;e was rendered her, by all ranks. Lord Chatham was among the foremo&s;t of her favourers; he was an admirer of <HI>native genius,</HI> and a likene&s;s of
<PB N="287" REF="034162_0633_0FFC6FE4A3687FB8">
this truly patriotic and de&s;erving nobleman, the pro|duction of her ingenuity, now figures among the prin|cipal ornaments of We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey.</P>
<P>Thus countenanced, and thus &s;upported, her income, it will be readily believed, was &s;ufficiently lucrative: She generally averaged nineteen guineas per week; and, con&s;idering the rapid progre&s;s &s;he had made to attain|ments &s;o &s;plendid, con&s;idering her origin, and group|ing in the &s;ame view her e&s;tabli&s;hed and unequivocal celebrity, we are ready to &s;uppo&s;e her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fulne&s;s of felicity; but, it is, alas! true, that per|manent happine&s;s is not the growth of humanity.</P>
<P>As Mrs. Wright po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great depth of under&s;tand|ing, her intellectual powers were, of cour&s;e, much exer|ci&s;ed, and the calculation of the probable con&s;equences of events, was to her a continued &s;ource of inquietude. She was a profound politician, and her regrets, on ac|count of the &s;truggles in which her native country was involved, were immea&s;urably afflicting.

<P>LET me execute the projected excur&s;ion in the month of competency; when the ripened fruits of Autumn, have received their riche&s;t fini&s;hing, and the life &s;upporting vegetable, crowned by maturity, invites the reaper's hand. This is the &s;election of many a judicious traveller; but be&s;ides that the curtailed days of September and October frequently &s;pread the evening &s;hades, before the di&s;tant tour is performed, I have many other cogent rea&s;ons for preferring the vernal months to a more advanced &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The morning of the year lifts its young head, and the enthu&s;ia&s;m of enchantment is in its gift; and although I do not contend for its intrin&s;ic &s;uperiority over the more &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ings attendant upon

harve&s;t home, yet, to the plea&s;ed eye of contemplation, it is adorned with inimitable charms. Many and ob|vious are the advantages it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es&mdash;its &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is the wi&s;h of every heart&mdash;it di&s;placeth the long dreary nights, which, with gloomy regency, have pervaded the wintry months&mdash;it unbars the gates of life&mdash;the &s;now clad mountains once more lift their green heads&mdash;the howling bla&s;ts of winter are no more&mdash;the tepid airs are abroad&mdash;de&s;cending &s;howers &s;ucceed each other&mdash;the mildly beaming &s;un emits its genial rays&mdash;all nature a&s;&s;umes an intere&s;ting a&s;pect&mdash;and the plea&s;ures of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion are in&s;eparably blended with tho&s;e of anticipation. Look where the &s;preading branches are loaded with the &s;weet &s;cented and promi&s;e giving blo&s;&s;om. See the flowery tribes expand their odoriferous leaves&mdash;the &s;urrounding atmo&s;phere is richly perfumed&mdash;every breeze bears its proportion of the grateful effluvia, and we ble&s;s the &s;alutary gale. The mellow toned warblers of the vernal &s;ea&s;on pur&s;ue their azure path, or enchantingly carol in the branches. The orient beams of light &s;mile along the ethereal plain; not a view but is &s;tampt with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible&mdash;but is fraught with images of rational plea&s;ure; nor can we do le&s;s than partake the general joy.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t returned from a tour of friend&s;hip, my heart at this moment glows with all tho&s;e complacent &s;en&s;ations in&s;pired by an exten&s;ive view of nature, garbed in her mo&s;t fa&s;cinating charms. My excur&s;ion has led me through a delightful divi&s;ion of the Union, diver&s;ified by grove crowned hills, romantic vales, enamelled meads, and broad meandering &s;treams. My route lay along Connecticut river, and through that part of the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, which led me over Charles river, Malden, Beverly, and E&s;&s;ex Merrimack bridges. Every ob&s;erver who hath traced this circuit, will readily acknowledge that it takes in a tract abounding with the &s;ublime and beautiful. The mo&s;t rapt &s;en&s;a|tions ru&s;hed on my &s;oul, while the poverty of words nece&s;&s;itated me to remain &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="034162_0636_0FFC6FDC933E1A08">
The la&s;t mentioned bridge pronounces a panegyric on the abilities of the ingenious Mr. Palmer. It is totally different from the others, and appears to me to be a complete piece of architecture. It hath a &s;in|gle arch which mea&s;ures 160 feet from ba&s;e to ba&s;e, and its elevation in the clear is forty feet above high water mark. The liberty, granted by the legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, for the erecting this bridge, was, I am told, clogged with conditions of a &s;ingular nature; but the particular &s;tipulation de&s;igned to cru&s;h it, has given it the noble&s;t effect; its &s;tability, by a wonderful contrivance, has received an a&euml;rial completion; and, while it exhibits every idea of durability of which its materials are &s;u&s;ceptible, it happily unites what is not always combined with this fundamental advantage, a light and airy contour; and its fini&s;hing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">truly elegant. Great commendation is due to the meritorious arti&s;t. With much labour he hath &s;ince thrown a bridge over that difficult &s;tream, commonly known by the name of Bloody Point Ferry; and he is now, we are told, employed in the Federal City, where, we doubt not, his talents and application will receive an adequate recompen&s;e.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex Merrimack bridge is u&s;eful and productive beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of the proprie|tors. It joins an enchantingly romantic little i&s;land to the main land: Its works are &s;o wholly detached, as to wear the appearance of two bridges; and the convexity produced by the arches, is extremely beau|tiful. A commodious hou&s;e of entertainment, con|taining dancing and dining halls, are frequently the &s;cene of tho&s;e plea&s;urable hours which the gentlemen and ladies of Newbury-Port devote to hilarity: it is di&s;tant from that re&s;pectable emporium only three miles, on a fine level tract, ornamented on either hand with trees of various growth, elegant &s;eats, di&s;tant hills, and verdant plains. From the window of this convivial tenement, we have a view of a beautiful grove on the right, and the towering bridge on the left; and, I am inclined to think, our country produces few more
<PB N="291" REF="034162_0637_0FFC6FD89DECD7C8">
captivating &s;cenes than are to be found upon Merri|mack bridge, and its environs.</P>
<P>I have enjoyed &s;ome delightful hours in the cour&s;e of my tour; I have brightened the chain of amity, and the heart of confidence is invigorated. My af|fections expand, they glance comprehen&s;ively on the univer&s;al family of man; and I feel that humanity, of whatever de&s;cription, or wherever found, is in&s;cribed by the finger of Deity, is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the unalien|able rights of fraternity.</P>
<P>Warmed by the genial heat of a vernal day, the in|valid quits the &s;olitude in which he hath been immur|ed; he inhales the &s;alutary breeze, and he becomes invigorated by the parent beam. The re&s;urrection of the year is al&s;o a &s;olace to old age, and it is frequently regarded as a figure replete with con&s;olation. "How fares you, Plato?" cried my friend, "I thought this fine &s;ea&s;on would bring you along; and I am glad to &s;ee you with all my heart."</P>
<P>Plato is a black man, born in Africa, who has num|bered, according to the mo&s;t accurate calculation which can be obtained, one hundred years; and he was for &s;ixty years of his life the confidential friend and faithful &s;ervant of his ma&s;ter. The good old gentleman, when dying, evinced his high &s;en&s;e of the merit of Plato, by be&s;towing on him his liberty, and bequeathing him a piece of land, &s;pacious enough to afford him, and a woman whom he had wedded, an ample &s;upport. A neat built cottage was upon the ground, it was &s;uitably and conveniently furni&s;hed, and the legacy comprized the nece&s;&s;ary farming uten|&s;ils.&mdash;"I am glad to &s;ee you with all my heart, Pla|to," &s;aid my friend&mdash;"<HI>Tanke,</HI> Sir, <HI>tanke,</HI>" replied Pla|to, "I come one <HI>pring</HI> more; I do know if I <HI>eber</HI> come agen; but all winter, when <HI>e cold weder</HI> and <HI>e torms</HI> come one after <HI>anoder,</HI> I <HI>tink</HI> I go and &s;ee ma&s;er's friends &s;oon <HI>eber e come pring.</HI> I got no new <HI>quaint|ance,</HI> ma&s;er's <HI>quaintance</HI> good enough for Plato; &s;o I <HI>go e</HI> &s;ee <HI>dem,</HI> and <HI>den</HI> Plato <HI>e</HI> go home, make <HI>e</HI> old woman glad to hear <HI>e</HI> friends all well."</P>

Happy advantage of years, which thus properly throws down tho&s;e di&s;tinctions of which we were once &s;o tena|cious: which gradually &s;lopes the way to that equality, re&s;erved for us in the &s;ilent tomb; and which may probably, in &s;ome degree, obtain, in the more perfect &s;tate of being on which we verge. Plato's &s;pring was a kind of renewal of his youth; and the anticipated regency of the vernal months, helped to cheer and buoy up his &s;pirits when the wintry bla&s;ts &s;ounded fearfully in his ear.</P>
<P>A few weeks &s;ince, and the trees di&s;robed of their verdant foliage, bent beneath their icy burden; the vigour of the &s;ea&s;on arre&s;ting the progre&s;s of the ready boatman, impo&s;ed upon his indu&s;try its incontrovertible embargo. How &s;trongly pointed is the captivating rever&s;e&mdash;the jocund &s;wain re&s;umes his agricultural employ; he carols gratefully as he ha&s;tens over the dewy lawn; he turns the fertile glebe; he &s;trews the promi&s;e giving &s;eed; and the golden days of harve&s;t ri&s;e to his imagination. The ro&s;y milk maid pa&s;&s;es cheerfully on; &s;he joins the mu&s;ic of the groves, war|bling, as &s;he trips along, the ru&s;tic lay. Aurora, with her purple fingers, hath opened the gates of morn; the heavens are fringed with gold; the &s;un-beams glitter over the azure vault, and the children of econ|omy re&s;ume their various employments. Again the boatmen ply their oars; the emancipated river invites their efforts; once more it becomes the path of com|merce, and a little fore&s;t floats upon the bo&s;om of the &s;ilver &s;tream.</P>
<P>I love the various excur&s;ion; and the different man|ners and cu&s;toms, ob&s;ervable even in neighbouring towns, are to me &s;ources of in&s;truction as well as amu&s;ement. Perhaps, were I to characterize my countrymen from my own experience, I might orig|inate very erroneous ideas; yet the faithful recorder will regi&s;ter as he ob&s;erves; and, impelled by truth, I have to &s;ay, that as far as hath come under my ob|&s;ervation, Columbia hath not neglected to acknowledge the claims of the &s;tranger. Wherever I have wan|dered,

ho&s;pitality hath hailed me welcome; and the grateful greetings of civility, when far di&s;tant from my native haunts, hath vibrated plea&s;antly on my ear. With a contemplative eye I have pa&s;&s;ed on, and the tracing of re&s;emblances hath been one of my plea&s;ures: many a dignified matron hath reminded me of my be|loved Mary; to the &s;ympathizing fair one I have re|counted the &s;tory of her conjugal faith, and the loves of my Margaretta and her Hamilton hath arre&s;ted the attention and intere&s;ted the feelings of the beau|teous female, who, unacquainted with their per&s;onal attractions, could only be influenced by a predilection for intrin&s;ic worth.</P>
<P>But I give place to a lady who&s;e tour of plea&s;ure &s;eems not to have corre&s;ponded either with her expec|tations or her merit, and who&s;e remarks may &s;erve as a proper &s;upplement to this E&s;&s;ay.</P>

<P>But, to begin my journey&mdash;I &s;at out, e&s;corted by my brother, a mode&s;t, docile young man, altogether as unequal to oppo&s;ition as my&s;elf; we had taken places in the &s;tage, a front &s;eat in which is generally thought the lea&s;t eligible; but as it was my wi&s;h to inhale the perfumed breeze, and to indulge my&s;elf with viewing the beauty of the &s;urrounding pro&s;pects, I had &s;tipulated for one of tho&s;e &s;eats. I was not, however, permitted to occupy it; my remon&s;trances were ineffectual; <HI>the travellers too well under&s;tood what belonged to politene&s;s,</HI> to let me remain in a &s;ituation ex|po&s;ed to du&s;t, wind and &s;un; and I was compelled to take my quarters in a back &s;eat, where I was ab&s;olute|ly nearly &s;uffocated in the want of air, and had noth|ing in view but the number of very <HI>civil per&s;ons,</HI> who had thus contrived, with a politene&s;s on which they plumed them&s;elves very highly, to intercept every oth|er pro&s;pect.

It can hardly be nece&s;&s;ary to name a man, who&s;e general celebrity was &s;o &s;trongly marked.

The circum&s;tance adverted to, took place in his youth, when his pul&s;e beat high for plea&s;ure, and the hilarity of his di&s;po&s;ition frequently pre&s;ented him at the &s;hrine of genuine humour.</P>
<P>A party of young men had determined to devote a morning to &s;hooting. Ru&s;&s;ell, the &s;oul of every enjoy|ment, was &s;olicited to join in the predatory &s;cheme; and, un&s;killed in the &s;cience of refu&s;al, the tenderne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition was for once &s;acrificed to his accom|modating temper. The evening preceding the ap|pointment was &s;pent in preparation for the important enterprize; and, at the peep of day, accoutred <HI>cap-a-pie</HI> for the occa&s;ion, he joined his depredating comrades. They marched for a time in a compact line; but judg|ing that &s;o formidable a body would &s;pread the alarm through the little community, again&s;t who&s;e rights they were plotting, they conceived &s;ome manoeuvring nece&s;&s;ary; and, departing in &s;eparate directions, they prepared to ambu&s;h the little beings, who, alas! po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed neither policy nor defence, &s;ufficient to en&s;hield either their own lives, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that of their beloved ne&s;t|lings.</P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ell placed him&s;elf in a cumbent po&s;ture on the velvet margin of a limpid &s;tream, almo&s;t &s;urrounded
<PB N="299" REF="034162_0645_0FFC79494AC1B538">
by the tall trees that towered on its banks; his piece, primed for execution, was by his &s;ide, and &s;carce a breeze interrupted the peaceful &s;erenity of the &s;cene. The &s;un was ju&s;t ri&s;ing above the horizon, and its ra|diant influence, darting through the foliage, &s;pangled every dew-drop, and glittered over the azure bo&s;om of the &s;lowly winding rivulet. The birds, at length, flut|tering in the branches, began the progre&s;s of the day. A parent robin perched on an extreme bough, im|pending exactly over the head of our young adventurer, uncon&s;cious of the mi&s;chiefs that awaited him, incau|tiou&s;ly kept his airy &s;tand. The ambu&s;hed foe pre&s;ent|ed his piece, took aim, gra&s;ped the trigger, and was on the point of di&s;charging his piece, when the un|wary warbler, apparently in the moment of his fate, poured forth from his little throat &s;uch a &s;tream of melody, as was more than &s;ufficient to arre&s;t the pur|po&s;e of a much greater adept in the &s;cience of bird-killing. The fa&s;cinating notes vibrated on the ear of Ru&s;&s;ell with &s;wan-like efficacy; he dropt his piece, and again reclined perdue; he &s;till li&s;tened; but his de&s;ign was to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear,</HI> and not to <HI>de&s;troy.</HI> The robin was &s;oon joined by numbers of the feathered choir, who, mingling their matin lays, continued melo|diou&s;ly chanting; the ambient zephyr echoed the &s;trains; every breath was in uni&s;on, and the mu&s;ic of nature floated around. It was a &s;cene worthy of benev|olence, and the rapt &s;oul of Ru&s;&s;ell acknowledged its congeniality. "Ble&s;t innocents!" he cried, <Q>go, war|ble in the ear of the maternal bird, and glad, by your &s;weete&s;t carols, the dome&s;tic ne&s;t; narrate, my little flutterers, how you have di&s;armed your enemy, and &s;ay, that again&s;t lives &s;o unoffending, his hand &s;hall never more be rai&s;ed.</Q> The birds, as if obedient to his mandate, or, more &s;trictly &s;peaking, alarmed by the &s;ound of his voice, &s;preading their party-coloured wings, in&s;tantly di&s;per&s;ed; and Ru&s;&s;ell, &s;houldering his firelock, triumphantly left the grove.</P>
<P>To the raillery con&s;equent on the tenderne&s;s of his nature, he was fully equal. His party had, what they
<PB N="300" REF="034162_0646_0FFC518BDABBDF40">
termed, a &s;ucce&s;sful morning; and the feathered vic|tims they produced, evinced the <HI>deathful</HI> valour of their exploits. Ru&s;&s;ell, on that memorable day, fea&s;ted on vegetables, in all their maturity of excellence and rich variety; he con&s;ecrated the era &s;acred from the repa&s;t of blood; and the ripened &s;trawberry, meliorated by refined &s;ugar and a flowing bowl of cream, crowned his de&s;&s;ert; nor was he ever after known to attempt aught again&s;t the defencele&s;s and tuneful inhabitants of the grove.</P>
<P>I have thought that Ru&s;&s;ell's robin was a fit com|panion for Uncle Toby's fly; and, that the annals of benevolence may no longer record the Shandian ebul|lition as a &s;olitary in&s;tance, it is here in&s;erted. I con|tend al&s;o, that the benign feelings which pre&s;erved the life of the robin, were original in the bo&s;om of Ru&s;|&s;ell; for, at that period, his eye had never travelled over the heterogeneous pages of Tri&s;tram Shandy.</P>
<P>The action, however trivial, was indicative of the di&s;po&s;ition of the man; and it may be viewed as a &s;in|gle thread of that web, the texture of which was equal and con&s;i&s;tent. He was, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, a philanthropi&s;t; the poet has perfectly delineated him. His &s;ympathy and humane exertions primarily embrac|ed tho&s;e who&s;e alliance to his blood naturally demanded his aid; but the rays of his beneficence, diverging from a centre &s;o virtuou&s;ly infixed, extended their genial in|fluence to his fellow-citizens at large; and the human being exi&s;ted not, who&s;e claim to his regard he refu&s;ed to acknowledge. Nay, his capacious mind, emanating from the Parent of the univer&s;e, encircled, by its over|flowing a&s;pirations, every being of every de&s;cription. He anticipated the extermination of evil; and he &s;aw, in imagination, vice, and its concomitant, &s;orrow, ban|i&s;hed from the wide exten&s;ive circle of all intelligence. No wonder then that earth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in his e&s;timation, &s;uperior charms, and that, viewing it as the production of a &s;upreme and beneficent Architect, it was dre&s;&s;ed for him in &s;miles. When the &s;evering angel caught from his embraces ho&s;e he be&s;t loved, he felt, it is
<PB N="301" REF="034162_0647_0FFA65BBEA921DF8">
true, a pang; but that pang was tran&s;ient; and, wip|ing from his cheek the natural tear, his elevated &s;pirit rejoiced in the a&s;&s;urance, that he al&s;o was in a &s;tate of progre&s;&s;ion, and that he &s;hould &s;oon rejoin them in a new and improved &s;tate of being. Thus he pa&s;&s;ed on; and, while he ble&s;&s;ed the bounties of Omnipotence, the virtues of heaven were imaged in his bo&s;om. Spirit of Pope! immortal bard! forgive this appropriating paraphra&s;e of thy rich and beautiful ver&s;ification; a de&s;cription of the philanthropi&s;t mu&s;t invariably in|volve thy well &s;elected ideas; and it &s;uits with thy mu|nificence to be&s;tow, from thy abundance, a portion of that thou can&s;t &s;o well &s;pare.</P>
<P>Benevolence&mdash;philanthropy&mdash;The name and charac|ter of Mr. Jo&s;eph Ru&s;&s;ell has been con&s;idered as &s;ynoni|mous with the&s;e virtues. Should I attempt to particular|ize his deeds of worth, innumerable in&s;tances would crowd around. Thronging fellow-citizens, aided by coun&s;el and by pecuniary gratuities&mdash;bankrupts rein&s;tated&mdash;the little tenement and hou&s;ehold goods of the widow redeemed from the mercile&s;s gra&s;p of the unfeeling creditor&mdash;helple&s;s orphans accommodated with pater|nal friends&mdash;public mea&s;ures, tending to the general good, powerfully &s;upported&mdash;&s;trangers ho&s;pitably re|ceived, and taught to hail a &s;econd home.</P>
<P>What were the feelings of the amiable, the youthful La Fayette! How &s;welled the bo&s;om, and how beat the pul&s;e of his worthy preceptor, when, in the hum|ble gui&s;e of per&s;ecuted foreigners, their wandering foot&s;teps fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold of the benevolent Ru&s;&s;ell! fir&s;t met, in that celebrated abode of genial ho&s;pitality, a reception &s;o amply &s;uited to their exigen|cies and their merits.</P>
<P>But vain in my recital. A virtue &s;o uncommon, and marked by &s;uch a multitude of in&s;tances, dazzles by its refulgence; and, although many of his philan|thropic exertions, which &s;hould have been recorded by the living fingers of immortal fame, enveloped by in|gratitude, and clouded by a train of &s;ucceeding cir|cum&s;tances, are nearly era&s;ed from the tablets of hu|manity;
<PB N="302" REF="034162_0648_0FFA65C0173383A0">
yet they are regi&s;tered in the archives of heaven; from their imagined ob&s;curity they &s;hall again emerge; and, in the day of retribution, they &s;hall blaze forth with additional &s;plendor.</P>
<P>But hark! what plaintive &s;ounds are tho&s;e which vibrate on the ear? The voice of the pen&s;ive Elmira, borne on the &s;tream of imagination, &s;trikes &s;uddenly on my memory; it breathes the &s;weet accents of grat|itude. Let us li&s;ten to its pathetic &s;trains.</P>
<P>"Forbear, my friend," &s;he exclaims, "Oh! forbear&mdash;clo&s;e not the page of panegyric, until I pour thereon my tributary &s;orrow&mdash;until I recite a &s;imple tale, and give a li&s;t of benefits, which demand of acknowledg|ment the bolde&s;t note that ever yet hath i&s;&s;ued from lively gratitude. My days of pro&s;perity were pa&s;&s;ed at a di&s;tance from the philanthropi&s;t; I had heard of him by the hearing of the ear, but my eyes had never &s;een him. My morn of life was happy; cheri&s;hed in the bo&s;om of parental tenderne&s;s, and ble&s;t with every requi&s;ite which my &s;ituation demanded, no rational wi&s;h remained ungratified. My wedded days &s;ucceed|ed; and my power of contributing to the felicity of my connexions, was rendered more various and plea&s;|ing. I dreamed not of portending evils, e&s;tabli&s;hed, as I conceived, in life; I looked not for the bur&s;ting &s;torm. Suddenly, however, it aro&s;e, and it deluged all tho&s;e fair pro&s;pects which had ble&s;t my youth; &s;urrounded by the waves of adver&s;ity, I was nearly overwhelmed by its billows. Writs of attachment; irritated creditors, and &s;heriffs' officers &s;urrounded tho&s;e doors that were barricaded with a frightful kind of vigilance. Abridged of liberty, that gem of incalcu|lable value, who&s;e cheering influence gilds by its own genial rays, even the cottage of freedom, I &s;teeped the hours in tears; and, at the &s;hrine of comfortle&s;s calamity, both my health and my rea&s;on were alike im|molated. My name was unknown to the philanthropi&s;t, but my &s;ufferings became its pa&s;&s;port; and, un&s;olicited, the benevolent Ru&s;&s;ell had the goodne&s;s to plead my cau&s;e: Per&s;ua&s;ion dwelt on his tongue; there was a
<PB N="303" REF="034162_0649_0FFA65D15247DEE0">
kind of magic in his virtues which generally operated &s;ucce&s;sfully. What mortal could achieve, he did; and, to mitigate tho&s;e ills he could not cure, he bent his utmo&s;t efforts. Change of air, exerci&s;e, a long journey&mdash;the&s;e were propo&s;ed by medical gentlemen for the re&s;toration of my pro&s;trated health and &s;pirits. I commenced my melancholy excur&s;ion; my unknown friend met me on my way: It was in the beautiful village of D&mdash;, that I fir&s;t &s;aw the philanthropi&s;t; he e&s;&s;ayed to cha&s;e &s;orrow from my mind, and to rekindle in my bo&s;om the plea&s;ures of anticipation. His kind interference followed me to the end of this tour of nece&s;&s;ity; and he mingled with the deare&s;t of my friends to gratulate my return. Nor did his beneficent efforts cea&s;e here; he was indefatigably per&s;evering in my favour, taking in my fate the deepe&s;t intere&s;t, aiding me with genuine delicacy, triumphing in every propitious event, and warding, as far as he might, every adver&s;e cloud. His acts of goodne&s;s to me, were the coevals of his being, and the la&s;t day of his abode in mortality witne&s;&s;ed his benevolent at|tentions.</P>
<P>"Cruel was the &s;troke of death; it pro&s;trated the hopes of the de&s;olate; it precipitated from the &s;ummit of felicity to depths of &s;orrow the female whom he judged worthy of his confidence; it bla&s;ted the filial expectations of that incomparable young man, who, it is &s;aid, inherits with his father's name his uncommon virtues; and it clad in mourning the PUBLIC MIND. Benevolent Man! Matchle&s;s Citizen! and now, indeed, <HI>Divine Philanthropi&s;t!</HI> Let the tears that marked thy exit, proclaim thy value. But <HI>reflection</HI> arre&s;ts the tide of &s;orrow; it impo&s;es &s;ilence on my lips, and I bow obedient to the behe&s;ts of THE ALMIGHTY."</P>
<P>Poor Elmira!&mdash;yet we believe her gratitude hath not too far emblazoned; and we therefore con&s;titute her &s;ketch a true &s;pecimen of the benevolent and un|commonly u&s;eful life of the late uniformly philan|thropic and <HI>virtue honoured</HI> JOSEPH RUSSELL.</P>

<P>WITH the &s;ubject of my la&s;t number I was intimately acquainted; his virtues were daily under my ob&s;ervation, and I was familiar with his deeds of worth.

The record of his life, is a record of &s;plendid actions&mdash;of actions, which, gem|med by compa&s;&s;ion, and its attendant &s;ympathies, uniformly gave to his character the highe&s;t lu&s;tre. With admirable propriety has the energetic Divine

adapted the &s;acred text; and a paraphra&s;e thereon might be entitled, an admea&s;urement of the virtues and the u&s;efulne&s;s of this univer&s;al benefactor.</P>
<P>"<HI>When the ear heard me, then it ble&s;&s;ed me.</HI>" Forlorn and di&s;con&s;olate, the children of adver&s;ity were en|compa&s;&s;ed about by &s;orrow; they looked, and there was no one to help, when &s;uddenly the renovating voice of commi&s;eration vibrated gratefully on the ear. Cheer up, ye &s;ons and daughters of &s;orrow, behold the almoner of your God! Our common Father hath en|tru&s;ted me with a portion of his property, that I may di&s;tribute to the nece&s;&s;ities of the de&s;titute: Come, therefore, my friends, and permit me to be&s;tow that, to which your claims are indubitable. "<HI>When the ear heard me, then it ble&s;&s;ed me;</HI>" nor is this &s;trange, &s;ince &s;o few people know how to approach the children of penury, with that con&s;ideration which their circum|&s;tances demand; no wonder that the voice of him who was exerci&s;ed in acts of benevolence, &s;hould extort ap|plau&s;e, even from the perception of frigidity.</P>
<P>"<HI>When the eye &s;aw me, it gave witne&s;s to me.</HI>" Yea, verily, from the contemplation of benignity, we derive &s;en&s;ations truly plea&s;urable; we trace, with a kind of con&s;cious pride, tho&s;e actions which confer a dignity on humanity; and, if &s;ickening envy is compo&s;ed by the powerful opiates of &s;elf-intere&s;t, we give full &s;cope to our admiration; our eyes are &s;uffu&s;ed by the tear of rapture; they delight to mark the philanthropi&s;t, and they follow, with ineffable complacency, &s;o illu&s;trious an ornament to humanity.

<PB N="307" REF="034162_0653_0FFA65EBBAD7D7C0">
they are productive of general benefit, and they are entitled to univer&s;al applau&s;e.</P>
<P>That Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell richly merited the eulogy of virtue, the unaffected &s;orrow with which all ranks of people re|garded his exit, fully evinceth. To repeat, that he well di&s;charged the filial duties, and was the principal prop of a venerable parent, who &s;till lives to mourn his depart|ure; to celebrate his attachment to the orphan children of a decea&s;ed brother; to dwell on his delicate and faith|ful affection to the amiable females who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively be|came the partners of his heart; to de&s;cant on his pater|nal goodne&s;s to tho&s;e of who&s;e exi&s;tence he was the au|thor; or, to expatiate on his beneficent regards to the individuals who compo&s;ed his hou&s;ehold, would be but a &s;uperfluous attempt to di&s;tingui&s;h and dignify propen|&s;ities, which are the re&s;idents of almo&s;t every bo&s;om; and, had Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only the&s;e common at|tachments of humanity, which are but a <HI>refined modifi|cation</HI> of <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI> he would have merited no tributary lay, and his panegyri&s;ts would have incurred the charge of adulation. But to the <HI>friend of the friendle&s;s,</HI> to the univer&s;al benefactor, the bard of integrity &s;pon|taneou&s;ly rai&s;eth the &s;ong; and, although the ear of death is heavy, that it cannot hear, yet we plea&s;ingly believe, that the immortal &s;pirit &s;leepeth not; nor is it irrational to &s;uppo&s;e, that it &s;ometimes bends from its etherial elevation, li&s;tening with complacency to the effu&s;ions of gratitude, to the expre&s;&s;ed commendations of tho&s;e virtuous children of men, who&s;e approbation it once delighted to merit.</P>
<P>To communicate benefits is truly godlike; and, in proportion as we are made in&s;trumental in di&s;&s;eminat|ting happine&s;s to our fellow-creatures, exactly in &s;uch proportion we imitate Him who went about doing good. The exerci&s;e of munificence is invariably re|garded with a glow of &s;atisfaction; and perhaps this ve&s;tige of an illu&s;trious and divine original, is never totally obliterated from the heaven-born mind. That Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell was eminently con&s;picuous for the <HI>number</HI> and <HI>value</HI> of his beneficent acts, the concurrent te&s;timo|nies
<PB N="308" REF="034162_0654_0FFA65F6EF4CC7A8">
of tho&s;e who be&s;t knew him unanimou&s;ly pro|claim. Seldom have we known a character who hath &s;o fully united the &s;uffrages of all ranks in this partic|ular; and it is, we conceive, on this ground, that the &s;plendor and eclat of his life is chiefly re&s;ted.</P>
<P>His integrity and punctuality as a merchant; his exten&s;ive commercial knowledge, with the va&s;t advan|tages which accrued from his mercantile career, were but the appendages of &s;ound policy, ingenuity, habit and application. The ea&s;y manners, the gracefully elevated deportment, the freedom of acce&s;s, and gen|uine politene&s;s, attributed to Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell, but de&s;ignate the gentleman. Early introduced to, and making a re&s;pectable part of, the mo&s;t genteel circles, it would have been rather &s;urpri&s;ing, if his deportment had not been that of a man thoroughly well bred. His wealth, and con&s;equent importance, might po&s;&s;ibly place him at the head of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, over which he pre&s;ided with honour to him&s;elf, and advantage to them; and his opulence may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been his pa&s;&s;port to many other honorary di&s;tinctions. But it has been pre&s;umed, that affectionate &s;ympathy and unre&s;erved &s;incerity are not <HI>generally</HI> the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of an inter|cour&s;e with what is called high life;</HI> and for the&s;e pro|ductive virtues, we are inclined to give the decea&s;ed philanthropi&s;t full credit; they were unque&s;tionably inherent in his bo&s;om; and hence i&s;&s;ued tho&s;e fertiliz|ing &s;treams, which made glad the &s;ons and daughters of &s;orrow; hence originated that cheerful and equal di&s;po&s;ition of mind, and that frankne&s;s of temper, which bani&s;hed &s;u&s;picion, and authorized the mo&s;t un|equivocal confidence; and, to the &s;ame &s;ource we may likewi&s;e trace his unbounded ho&s;pitality, and that man|ly and grateful welcome, with which he ever greeted the foot&s;teps of the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Religion diffu&s;ed over the excellent qualities of his heart her meliorating influence; he reverenced her laws, and bent in humble acquie&s;cence and filial obe|dience to her dictates. Her mini&s;ters po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his re|&s;pectful and di&s;tingui&s;hing regards; he con&s;tantly lent

them his countenance; he was particularly fond of patronizing men of merit in this line; and the hand|&s;ome benefaction which he be&s;towed on the fund ap|propriated to the relief of tho&s;e among their widows, who&s;e circum&s;tances are embarra&s;&s;ed, is evincive of his attachment to, and con&s;ideration for, this venera|ble body. Here again we are brought round to a contemplation of that liberality, on which we have cho&s;en principally to rear the &s;uper&s;tructure of his fame. It is &s;aid that Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell annually appropri|ated <HI>twelve thou&s;and dollars</HI> to private charities! What an ample relief mu&s;t this &s;um, di&s;tributed by the hand of economy, have afforded to tho&s;e indigent &s;ufferers, who were the pen&s;ioners of his bounty! How do the virtues which give birth to &s;uch liberal arrangements command e&s;teem! how do they endear the man, and exalt the citizen! And who but mu&s;t painfully regret the exit of a per&s;onage, by who&s;e departure &s;uch rich and copious &s;treams are, alas! &s;uddenly dried up? Who but mu&s;t &s;upplicate the Fountain of munificence, that they may again &s;pring forth in the lives of his de&s;cendants? who, if they pur&s;ue the path marked out for them by their illu&s;trious ance&s;tors, will unque&s;tion|ably in&s;ure to them&s;elves the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible honours, the e&s;teem, confidence and approbation of their fellow|men, the peace of their own bo&s;oms, and the plaudit of their Creator.</P>
<P>But the munificence of Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell was not <HI>exclu|&s;ively</HI> &s;hared by tho&s;e claimants, to whom his judgment apportioned occa&s;ional gratuities; nor was it wholly confined to the citizens of Columbia. Mankind in gen|eral, according to their nece&s;&s;ities, &s;eemed to be the object of his beneficence, while his diffu&s;ive and equal regards extended their genial influence to the far di&s;tant &s;hore. In&s;tances of his genero&s;ity are, que&s;tionle&s;s, echoed in many a clime; but a recent example, &s;trikingly in point, may &s;erve as a clo&s;e to this &s;ketch.</P>
<P>A re&s;pectable hou&s;e in a celebrated European em|porium, (the capital of which was &s;uppo&s;ed immen&s;e) celebrated for punctuality and probity, &s;uddenly &s;top|ped

payment, and a&s;toni&s;hment pervaded every de|&s;cription of our merchants. This misfortune was not attributed to ill conduct, but rather to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of adver&s;e accidents; and an arrangement was &s;peedily produced, which enabled one of the firm to vi&s;it Ameri|ca, for the purpo&s;e of collecting out&s;tanding debts. This gentleman arrived in the town of Bo&s;ton, the metropolis of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, (which place Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell then dignified by his pre&s;ence) under the pre&s;&s;ure of very unplea&s;ant circum&s;tances. Both the hou&s;e and heart of the generou&s;ly ho&s;pitable Ru&s;&s;ell were open for his reception. A travelling prince could &s;carcely have been received with higher marks of re&s;pectful atten|tion; and he found in the bo&s;om of this worthy fami|ly, during his abode there, an elegantly plea&s;ing a&s;y|lum. But this was not enough&mdash;the kindne&s;s of the American merchant &s;topped not here. From the pe|riod which announced the failure of the European hou&s;e, no commercial negociation had been entru&s;ted to its firm. Under &s;uch a cloud the wary trader &s;tood aloof; but the bo&s;om of Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ym|pathetic chord, which, as &s;urely as his eye glanced on the children of adver&s;ity, uniformly vibrated to pity; he regarded the claims of misfortune as &s;acred; and he conceived, that the &s;uffering individual impo&s;ed on him duties which were indi&s;pen&s;able. Through the <HI>powerful aid</HI> and <HI>exten&s;ive influence</HI> of Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell, two &s;hips, richly laden with We&s;t-India productions, and calculated, with their cargoes, to amount to not le&s;s than <HI>forty thou&s;and pounds,</HI> were con&s;igned to the pro&s;|trate hou&s;e! The emoluments ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of the&s;e valuable appropriations, let the arithmetician compute. What an advantageous re-commencement of bu&s;ine&s;s was thus furni&s;hed&punc; and what a benign lu&s;tre is thereby thrown over the American name! But a further act of beneficence remains to be re|counted.</P>
<P>On the departure of the European, Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell, with that delicacy which is the appendage of munifi|cent actions, pre&s;ented him with bills, for his &s;eparate
<PB N="311" REF="034162_0657_0FFA6601071F5958">
and &s;ole u&s;e, to the amount of <HI>five hundred pounds &s;ter|ling;</HI> inclo&s;ing, al&s;o, like &s;ums for &s;imilar purpo&s;es, to the unfortunate gentlemen with whom he &s;tood con|nected!!! To throw the veil of &s;ilence over virtues thus &s;plendid, would, we conceive, betray a phlegmatic or an envious mind; and the advantages re&s;ulting from eulogizing the meritorious dead, are too obvious to need enumeration.</P>
<P>The panegyri&s;t of the everla&s;tingly ab&s;ent, if he lev|ies no tax on &s;urvivors, cannot be accu&s;ed of intere&s;t|ed motives; he has but expre&s;&s;ed his admiration of what he has conceived <HI>ab&s;tractedly good;</HI> he does not do homage to the creature, for he regards every vir|tue as emanating from Deity; and he is morally and religiou&s;ly certain, that he ri&s;ks nothing by pro&s;trat|ing before the image of his Creator, wherever it may con&s;i&s;t with the arrangements of Omnipotence to im|pre&s;s it.</P>

<P>THE experience of every day evinces that hu|manity is &s;ubject to error; tho&s;e calculations that we fancy we have made with the greate&s;t accuracy, frequently, by proving the rever&s;e of truth, betray our total ignorance both of cau&s;es and effects. I have
<PB N="312" REF="034162_0658_0FFA6605487BE3E8">
&s;ometimes fea&s;ted, by anticipation, for many days, on the refined and genuine plea&s;ures which I confidently believed would re&s;ult from the collection of a &s;elect party of &s;entimentali&s;ts, who were, by appointment, to devote a few hours to the &s;ocial enjoyments of conver|&s;ation. My heart has beat high with expectation, and I have ha&s;ted with avidity to the place of rendezvous; but, in vain have I watched for the moment of &s;enti|ment; in vain &s;ighed for the richly enrobed thought, which I might bear as a trophy from a &s;cene where I had calculated to partake the fea&s;t of rea&s;on; for, &s;trange to tell, the gems of intellect were muffled in the thicke&s;t clouds&mdash;not a ray was elanced&mdash;and the company have &s;eparated without a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation which could merit an in&s;cription upon the tablets of memory!</P>
<P>But, if I have been nece&s;&s;itated to confe&s;s that expec|tations, originating in rea&s;on, have proved fallacious, my mortification has been amply balanced by oppor|tunities from which I have reaped a large &s;upply of intellectual enjoyments, where I have looked for ta&s;te|le&s;s &s;ilence, or noi&s;y mirth.</P>
<P>Con&s;iderations of intere&s;t, the duties of good neigh|bourhood, or motives of general civility, have fre|quently introduced me to parties, that, but for the obligations thus impo&s;ed, I &s;hould have avoided. Yet, in the&s;e re&s;orts, a rich repa&s;t has awaited me! Nature, unadulterated, and replete with &s;terling worth, has &s;tood confe&s;&s;ed; &s;ilence, impre&s;&s;ed by re&s;pectful at|tention, has hung on the lips of the hearers, and thus endowed with energy even the <HI>timid &s;peaker.</HI> Inquiry has produced inquiry; a &s;ubject of conver&s;ation has obtained the general ear; individuals have alternately expre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments; rational conclu&s;ions have been deduced; and I have returned home, informed, complacent and happy.</P>
<P>"<HI>We are to have a pantomimical exhibition at the Thea|tre&mdash;will you go, Mr. Vigillius?</HI>" &s;aid an inquirer; No, Sir&mdash;I dete&s;t pantomimes. Speech was be&s;towed on man as a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of &s;uperiority; and
<PB N="313" REF="034162_0659_0FFA68CAE97AFCF0">
it is, methinks, a &s;trange depravity of ta&s;te, which, reject|ing this dignifying advantage, confineth the performer to dumb &s;hew: Be&s;ides, I have an in&s;uperable aver&s;ion to the degradation of the "<HI>human form divine." Man was made in the image of his Maker,</HI> and I regard the deba&s;ement of this image, as ab&s;olute profanity. The antic ge&s;tures which the pantomimical performer fre|quently a&s;&s;umes, in my opinion, do violence to every idea of propriety; and I pity the mind which is &s;uffi|ciently vitiated to draw amu&s;ement from &s;uch fanta&s;|tical &s;ources.</P>
<P>"<HI>I will not di&s;pute the correctne&s;s of your ta&s;te, Mr. Gleaner,</HI>" returned the gentleman, "<HI>but the pantomime is to be preceded by Shake&s;pear's Tempe&s;t, or Enchanted I&s;land.</HI>" What lover of the drama but feels his bo&s;om glow at the mention of this immortal bard? I had read the Tempe&s;t, but I had never &s;een it on the &s;tage; and a friend, who&s;e judgment no votary of &s;cience hath ever yet impeached, had informed me its <HI>&s;tage effect</HI> was wonderful.</P>
<P>Yes, I will go by all means; and, elated by the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, in a front box I obtained a front &s;eat. The curtain drew up; and the tempe&s;ted &s;hip&mdash;the billowy waves&mdash;the &s;torm of thunder and lightning&mdash;the affrighted mariners&mdash;the cra&s;h of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alling ma&s;t, all together, obtained their full effect; and I could &s;carcely have believed it in the power of fiction to have rai&s;ed &s;uch a hurricane in my brea&s;t. But, from this moment, I experienced little el&s;e but di&s;ap|pointment and di&s;gu&s;t. Some of the fine&s;t &s;entiments were &s;o mangled and mutilated, that it became impo&s;|&s;ible to re-unite them, or to endow them with that divine energy, thus extingui&s;hed by their di&s;&s;olution, which was breathed into them by the creative bard, when they fir&s;t received the vital principle. Whole &s;peeches were &s;o mouthed and mi&s;repre&s;ented, that we &s;miled were we &s;hould have wept; and were fretting with vexation, when the genuine wit of the inimitable author &s;hould have excited the mo&s;t mirthful approba|tion! Yet the part of Pro&s;pero was well &s;upported; he
<PB N="314" REF="034162_0660_0FFC518A035122E8">
&s;eemed apprized of the gravity of his character, and he &s;eldom forgot his dignity. Ariel, al&s;o, the &s;pirit Ariel, her &s;ylph like movements would indeed have become an inhabitant of the blue expan&s;e; &s;he was exactly what we could have wi&s;hed her, as near cele&s;tial as the habiliments of mortality would permit; not a &s;oul but ble&s;t the winged vi&s;ion, and not a hand but was rai&s;ed to approbate her emancipating a&s;cen|&s;ion. Her "<HI>follow, follow, follow,</HI>" &s;till vibrates melo|diou&s;ly on my ear; indeed, even the mo&s;t phlegmatic mu&s;t confe&s;s that Mi&s;s Harding is a very lovely and a very promi&s;ing child. With re&s;pect to the other performers, they generally overtopped or undervalued their parts; and, although Dorinda and Miranda were very engaging women, yet they &s;eemed to have little idea of that artle&s;s &s;implicity with which the education they were &s;uppo&s;ed to receive, &s;hould have inve&s;ted them; and I &s;u&s;pect it will be &s;ome time before they will be qualified for an a&s;&s;umption of Shake&s;pear's capital characters.</P>
<P>The play over, I was hurrying away, with the pain|ful reflection that I had lo&s;t an evening; but in the moment of my intended departure, I was arre&s;ted by the ob&s;ervation, that a <HI>&s;erious pantomime</HI> was to be pre|&s;ented. <HI>A &s;erious pantomime!</HI> repeated I. I will &s;tay then, and &s;ee of what &s;tuff a <HI>&s;erious pantomime</HI> is com|po&s;ed. La Forete Noire, or the Picture Di&s;covered&mdash;this was the title of the piece; and, to my great a&s;ton|i&s;hment, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every feature of a well conceived and regular comedy. The plot was evident and &s;trik|ingly worked up; it had its <HI>Prota&s;is,</HI> its <HI>Epita&s;is,</HI> and its <HI>Cata&s;ta&s;is;</HI> and the&s;e introduced a mo&s;t happy <HI>ca|ta&s;trophe.</HI> Whether the <HI>unities</HI> are &s;trictly pre&s;erved, I cannot exactly determine; but if they are not, while Shake&s;pear abounds with precedents of the utmo&s;t latitude in this re&s;pect&punc; an inferior author will hardly become incon&s;olable for &s;uch defects. On the drawing up of the curtain, Madame G&mdash; was di&s;covered at her toilette; from her work-bag &s;he drew a parcel of letters, from which, &s;electing one, &s;he &s;eemed almo&s;t
<PB N="315" REF="034162_0661_0FFC5188780FD650">
to devour the contents; and while &s;he traced and re|traced the lines, we read, in her agitated countenance, the &s;tronge&s;t emotions; Suddenly &s;he aro&s;e, and now, with quick and perturbed &s;teps, anon &s;olemn and &s;low, &s;he traver&s;ed the &s;tage, evidently &s;truggling to obtain that &s;elf-command, which may put her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome degree of calmne&s;s&mdash;her efforts prove ineffectual, and &s;he ha&s;tens to the wain&s;cot, where, touching a &s;ecret &s;pring, the pannel flies back, and exhibits a por|trait, to which &s;he addre&s;&s;es the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned a&s;pi|rations. Every one readily concluded that the picture was the re&s;emblance of a per&s;on who&s;e image was unque&s;tionably engraven on her heart, and who&s;e letters &s;he had been &s;o fervidly peru&s;ing. On the ap|proach of foot&s;teps &s;he retouched the &s;pring, and the friendly pannel again concealed the object to whom &s;he had been breathing her tributary &s;ighs. A figure, on who&s;e brow the dignity of manhood &s;at enthroned, next approached; &s;he ha&s;tened to meet him; and we he&s;itated not to pronounce him the original of the portrait, the writer of the letters, and the man of her affections. A tender interview having &s;ucceeded, the almo&s;t di&s;tracted fair one warned him of approaching danger; and, &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, &s;o heart affecting were her pleadings, that, yielding to her energetically enforced wi&s;hes, and tearing him&s;elf from her embraces, he reluctantly made his e&s;cape from the open ca&s;ement to which &s;he had conducted him. Our heroine then approached an apartment, and a particular &s;ignal produced from thence a beautiful boy, whom &s;he em|braced with &s;uch animated tran&s;port, as induced us to pronounce, without he&s;itation, that &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him to a maternal bo&s;om: After &s;he had evinced, by a variety of animated ge&s;tures the inherent claim he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to her protection, &s;he led him, all agitated and trem|bling, to her toilette, and, putting into his hands a letter, the peru&s;al of which produces in the child the unequivocal expre&s;&s;ions of &s;urpri&s;e, affection and filial duty, &s;he has once more recour&s;e to her trea&s;ure behind the wain&s;cot; &s;he points it out to the little
<PB N="316" REF="034162_0662_0FFC51829D85DC80">
cherub, who, in a tran&s;port of duteous attachment, a&s;&s;ays to gra&s;p the re&s;pected figure, leaps on his feet, throws abroad his hands, cla&s;ps them in a petitioning attitude, as if &s;oliciting a father's benediction; and, in &s;hort, demon&s;trates, beyond the power of language, every emotion which could be &s;uppo&s;ed to triumph in the affectionate bo&s;om of innocence, on an unexpected di&s;covery of the author of its being. Ju&s;t at this junc|ture, a loud noi&s;e interrupted the &s;weet and amiable effu&s;ions of young attachment; the boy was hurried to his place of concealment, the picture veiled, and the lady prepared to meet the approaching &s;torm; nor was &s;he long held in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Her father entered, and, ignorant of the marriage &s;he had clande&s;tinely procured, he was accompanied by a per&s;on, whom from his dre&s;s we conclude to be an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, whom he commands her to receive as her future hu&s;band. The authority of this father was marked by au&s;tere &s;everity; he en|joined with unrelenting &s;ternne&s;s, and it was evident that he would admit of no appeal. The lady entreat|ed, but her &s;upplications were ineffectual; her tyran|nic father continued obdurate. It appears he is one of tho&s;e grey beards, again&s;t whom Octavian, in the Mountaineers, is &s;o ju&s;tly exa&s;perated; and of cour&s;e he is peremptory and de&s;potic, and his weeping daughter is left to receive the man in black as her intended lord and ma&s;ter. He, good &s;oul, appears to po&s;&s;e&s;s a comfortable &s;hare of <HI>&s;ang-froid,</HI> and a mo&s;t ludicrous &s;cene en&s;ues, to which the lady puts an end by making her e&s;cape; when her would be lover &s;neaks off in a manner which may be termed mock heroic.</P>
<P>The &s;ecreted child then pre&s;ents him&s;elf, who, peeping from his confinement, and finding no one to cro&s;s his path, is compelled, by a very natural curio&s;ity, to retrace the lines which had given him &s;uch &s;urprizing information; he &s;eizes the work-bag, and, &s;kipping with it to the front of the &s;tage, places him&s;elf in a convenient attitude for examination; one letter is taken out, and another, and another,

which, not proving the paper he wi&s;hed, are carele&s;s|ly to&s;&s;ed about, until, with childi&s;h impetuo&s;ity, he gra&s;ps the whole parcel, and after throwing them promi&s;cuou&s;ly over the floor, relinqui&s;hing the pur|&s;uit, he ha&s;tes to catch one more glance at the be|loved portrait, by which he had been &s;o much cap|tivated. With &s;kilful hand he touches the ready &s;pring, the obedient pannel yields to his pre&s;&s;ure, and he again exhibits tho&s;e te&s;timonies of a duteous heart which are &s;o becoming, and in him &s;o hazardous. But as the tremendous thunder and the lightning's glare, to him who had promi&s;ed him&s;elf a &s;erene &s;ky, or as the roar of the hungry lion, to the traveller who dreamed of &s;ecurity, thus fearfully portentous &s;ounded the tread of authority in the ear of the poor affrighted victim, who, all trembling and appalled, flew to his place of &s;helter, regardle&s;s of the letters that &s;trewed the floor, and utterly forgetting to veil the trea&s;ured portrait. The old gentleman entered, and, &s;tarting with a&s;toni&s;hment at the lettered floor, he happened to &s;tumble upon the explanatory paper which the boy had overlooked; he reads, and a hur|ricane of the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ucceeds; all is revealed; the clande&s;tine marriage, the child, his &s;ecret re&s;idence, the pannel&mdash;he rai&s;es his eyes, and the uncovered picture vouches the authenticity of every &s;yllable! He traver&s;es the &s;tage, &s;tamps, di&s;torts his figure, and acts a part proper for the madman, which &s;ur|pri&s;e and unrelenting cruelty had rendered him. With demon&s;trations of ungovernable rage, he makes his way to the &s;anctuary of innocence; and, rudely &s;eizing the little &s;ufferer, he &s;eems about to &s;acrifice him to his vengeance; but the uproar producing the entrance of two ill-looking fellows, the beauteous boy, with expre&s;&s;ions of &s;avage barbarity, is commit|ted to them! In vain the little unfortunate kneels and &s;upplicates; his pleadings avail him not; and the ap|pearance of his mother, while it heightens the agony of the &s;cene, procures no relenting in the brea&s;t of the grandfather! She weeps, pro&s;trates and implores;

but had &s;he a&s;&s;ailed the rude winds, or the impen|etrable rock, her interce&s;&s;ions had been as effectual; driven to de&s;peration, &s;he &s;eizes the lovely child, and once more pre&s;&s;es him to her maternal bo&s;om; by command of her &s;avage parent, he is torn from her embraces, and forcibly hurried away by the ruffians to whom he is committed! while the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed lady, fainting in the arms of her attendant, is borne off, and the &s;cene is thus terminated.</P>
<P>We were next introduced to a dreary fore&s;t, where we met the little exile, for whom we were &s;o deeply intere&s;ted, with the two ruffians, who &s;eem on the point of imbruing their hands in innocent blood!! By the mo&s;t heart-affecting ge&s;tures, the little mourner di&s;covers the agony of his &s;oul; but mercy is denied him, and he trembles on the verge of eternity, when he is &s;uddenly re&s;cued by the captain of a banditti, who, putting tho&s;e <HI>authorized</HI> a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to flight, takes the boy under his protection. The robber's de&s;ign to guard the child was unequivocally expre&s;&s;ed, by his wrapping him in his enormous cloak; and when the &s;ucceeding &s;cene pre&s;ents the a&s;&s;embled banditti, pro|ducing their various booty, we are prepared to admire their chief, who uncovers the re&s;cued innocent as the fruits of his expedition. The di&s;gu&s;t expre&s;&s;ed by the nefarious fraternity, is the con&s;equent re&s;ult of their depravity; and we cannot but tremble for the little wanderer, although apprized that his protector is at hand, when we find him on the point of being &s;acri|ficed to the turpitude of their feelings. His &s;econd re&s;cue by the commander of the&s;e atrocious offenders&mdash;his &s;ub&s;equent pleadings for him who&s;e hand was rai&s;ed to take his life&mdash;the appeal of the chief to his &s;ubordinates&mdash;his &s;triking compari&s;on between the un|merited clemency of that infant, and their unmanly and groundle&s;s malice&mdash;with the extorted applau&s;e and reconciliation which en&s;ued, were finely imagined, and a mo&s;t wonderful piece of acting.</P>
<P>On the di&s;per&s;ion of the robbers, we are called to witne&s;s a &s;truggle in the bo&s;om of the little hero, be|tween

his gratitude to his pre&s;erver and his filial af|fection. He wore on his brea&s;t the miniature of his mother; this picture captivated the robber, and he endeavoured to prevail on the boy to relinqui&s;h it. Agitated to an extreme, he entreats permi&s;&s;ion to re|tain it&mdash;any thing el&s;e he would part with&mdash;but that picture, cla&s;ping it to his heart, that picture mu&s;t &s;till remain with him. The robber offers him in exchange an elegant watch&mdash;this charms him&mdash;he &s;eizes it with avidity, views it over and over, admires it much, claps it to his ear&mdash;and then, catching the picture, pre&s;&s;es it to his lips, and, with a &s;mile of &s;elf-complacency, de|livers up the watch. The robber, (I can hardly pre|vail on my&s;elf &s;o frequently to be&s;tow on him this de|te&s;table epithet) charmed by the &s;trength of his filial affection, and admiring &s;o much firmne&s;s in a mind &s;o young, made him a pre&s;ent of the watch, and led him off in triumph.</P>
<P>The eventful fore&s;t then pre&s;ents the lady her&s;elf, &s;urrounded by the banditti. Either a voluntary exile from her father's hou&s;e, or driven thence by his &s;avage cruelty, &s;he had wandered forth, and, ere &s;he was aware, her trembling &s;teps had led her to tho&s;e haunts of horror!! All the energies of commi&s;eration are now rou&s;ed to action. A female&mdash;in a thick fore&s;t&mdash;&s;urrounded by the mo&s;t hardened wretches&mdash;no eye to pity, and no hand to protect. The abandoned villains evidently meditate the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es&mdash;rudely they gra&s;p her hands&mdash;they &s;eem to confer on a divi&s;ion of their prize&mdash;and, like &s;avage bea&s;ts of prey, they exult over their agonized victim. The di&s;tre&s;s of the lady is beyond de&s;cription&mdash;her fine tre&s;&s;es hang in di&s;or|dered ringlets on her well-formed &s;houlders&mdash;angui&s;h riots in her pallid countenance&mdash;and &s;uccour, alas! is placed beyond all rational hope. At this moment, the captain of the banditti, accompanied by his little fa|vourite, makes his appearance&mdash;a tran&s;ient gleam of joy illumes the grief-worn countenance of the lady&mdash;&s;he &s;natches her child to her bo&s;om&mdash;but alas! the chief, more enchanted by the original than the picture,
<PB N="320" REF="034162_0666_0FFC5178C9486378">
immediately prefers his ferocious &s;uit&mdash;he is rejected with &s;pontaneous marks of dete&s;tation&mdash;a pointed po|niard &s;eems to be the alternative, to which, pre&s;enting her defencele&s;s bo&s;om, &s;he &s;miles beneath the expected &s;troke. The mode of attack was then changed; and, while her beloved child is held by two of the mo&s;t hardened of the banditti, a &s;word is pointed at his brea&s;t, which, it appears, her continued refu&s;al will pierce with the &s;troke of death! Is it po&s;&s;ible to imag|ine a &s;ituation more &s;hockingly intere&s;ting? Her feel|ings were wrought up to a degree of frenzy&mdash;de&s;pair nerved her efforts&mdash;and, with more than mortal cour|age, &s;he flew, and, &s;natching the boy, fled with him from her pur&s;uers! Again, however, &s;he was over|taken; but in the &s;truggle, the general attention being arre&s;ted by the lady, the boy e&s;caped, and &s;he is borne off by the banditti.</P>
<P>But the pantomime draws towards a clo&s;e, and hope begins to dawn. We are pre&s;ented with the hero of the piece; his figure is commanding, and his counte|nance unites the traits of tho&s;e virtues, which go to the conformation of the gentleman and the &s;oldier. His company is drawn up on the &s;tage, and he is in the act of performing the manual exerci&s;e, when &s;ud|denly a little cherub, agitated and trembling, ru&s;hes forward, and, kneeling at the feet of the military com|mander, &s;upplicates his extricating hand; and, to make certain the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he &s;olicited, he pre&s;ents the picture of his mother, then a &s;uffering captive in the hands of the mo&s;t abandoned of the human race. The picture was in&s;tantly recognized; and a&s;toni&s;h|ment, paternal affection, joy, grief, love, dete&s;tation, pity, indignation, tender apprehen&s;ion, and determined bravery, in one pathetically intere&s;ting and tumultu|ous contra&s;t, were &s;trikingly grouped. But no time was to be lo&s;t. In&s;tantly, in a manner expre&s;&s;ive of the hurricane in his brea&s;t, catching his &s;on in his arms, and followed by his &s;oldiers, he pur&s;ued his way to that rece&s;s of atrocious villany, to which his little guide directed. The con&s;equences were preci&s;ely

what might have been expected; the robbers were &s;ur|pri&s;ed in tho&s;e haunts which they had believed &s;ecure; a &s;kirmi&s;h en&s;ued; fire-arms were employed; &s;ucce&s;s declared on the &s;ide of rectitude; the banditti were completely defeated; and the victor, when in the mo|ment of plunging his &s;word into the bo&s;om of their chief, finds his arm arre&s;ted by his heroic boy, who forcibly repre&s;enting the obligations he was under to this generous delinquent, who had repeatedly re&s;cued him from the &s;troke of death, induced his father to rai&s;e him from the de&s;pairing attitude he had a&s;&s;umed, and to extend unto him the hand of forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>The parent of the lady now enters. Sorrow had meliorated his brea&s;t, and he &s;eeks his daughter in that fore&s;t whither he &s;uppo&s;es &s;he had wandered. Tran&s;|ports unutterable grew in his &s;oul at this rencountre; reconciliation and pardon dwelt on every feature and in every expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;ture; and the piece concludes with an act of general amne&s;ty, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of conferring happine&s;s upon every worthy individual.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay that I have given an accurate &s;ketch of <HI>La Forete Noire.</HI> I &s;aw it only once&mdash;&s;ome months have &s;ince elap&s;ed, and my memory may have been treacherous; but, during its pre&s;entation, I was inter|e&s;ted, alarmed and &s;oothed, and the fine&s;t feelings of my heart were in exerci&s;e. From Shake&s;pear's Tem|pe&s;t I expected much, but I had the mortification to witne&s;s its murder! Pantomimical mummery I abhor|ed&mdash;yet the pantomime proved a rich entertainment; and, felicitating my&s;elf on the various talents with which humanity is endowed, I was happy they could be thus called into action; and I rejoiced in that ac|commodating pliability which be&s;towed the power of embodying the feelings, even without the aid of lan|guage.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>If the &s;oft bands of amity entwin'd,</L>
<L>And kindred motives &s;way'd each letter'd mind,</L>
<L>The &s;catter'd rays of genius to collect,</L>
<L>And all its broad diverging pow'rs connect&mdash;</L>
<L>With hues more vivid, &s;cience then would glow,</L>
<L>And arts expan&s;ive, to perfection grow:</L>

<L>Corro&s;ive mildews &s;ick'ning envy &s;preads,</L>
<L>And de&s;olation marks the path &s;he treads!</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I COULD wi&s;h, methinks, that men of letters, and profe&s;&s;ors of the fine arts, would, by mutual con|&s;ent, form them&s;elves into one great and illu&s;trious commonwealth, appointing their &s;everal officers, com|mittees of corre&s;pondence, and per&s;ons duly qualified to examine the claims of every candidate, who became de&s;irous of a &s;ituation in their community; and I &s;hould, moreover, be &s;olicitous that the republic, when organized, &s;hould be careful to impre&s;s on the minds of their delegates, the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving, in the in|ve&s;tigation of tho&s;e preten&s;ions which might come be|fore them, the &s;tricte&s;t <HI>impartiality.</HI></P>
<P>There are grades in the intellectual as well as the natural world; and he, who may fill one &s;tation with re&s;pectability, may be utterly inadequate to the duties of another. Yet, let not the mental energies be de|pre&s;&s;ed; per&s;everance may do much; efforts gather &s;trength by action, and emulation, lending wings to
<PB N="6" REF="034162_0672_0FFC54A0E7BF0898">
ambition, becomes an irre&s;i&s;tible &s;timulus. The cla&s;&s;ic periods of a Belknap are not the production of every pen, nor is the energy of a Ram&s;ay the growth of every mind; yet, the &s;tory of this new world, and the intere&s;ting events of the revolution, may become the exerci&s;e of humbler talents; and, garbed in &s;imple language, may, for a certain cla&s;s of readers, po&s;&s;e&s;s peculiar charms. From the lyre of Philenia i&s;&s;ues the mo&s;t captivating &s;trains; correct, and highly poli&s;hed, her deathle&s;s page may &s;tand without a rival; but, &s;hall the <HI>lowly mu&s;e,</HI> for this, re&s;ign tho&s;e magic pow|ers, which give lu&s;tre to the eye of grief, and &s;weetly whi&s;per the &s;oothing joys of mild tranquillity? Forbid it, every rich, ennobling motive, which &s;wells to emula|tion. No&mdash;rather let the trembling candidate, mark|ing Philenia as a &s;tar of guidance, call into action eve|ry glowing energy, each ble&s;t incitement, which may allure to eminence, and adventurou&s;ly a&s;&s;ay the radi|ant path, in which the lovely vi&s;ion, with beamy ex|cellence, &s;o &s;plendidly &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P><HI>Well directed</HI> ambition, is, perhaps, the ma&s;ter &s;pring of every great achievement, and order &s;hould con&s;ti|tute the &s;tamina of a literary republic. I would have every de&s;cription of intellect exactly in its proper place; I contend, only, that the &s;malle&s;t &s;park of genius, &s;o far from being quenched by <HI>cold neglect,</HI> or extingui&s;h|ed by the <HI>chilling bla&s;ts of critici&s;m,</HI> &s;hould be furni&s;hed with tho&s;e incitements, which are calculated to blow it into a flame; and, was genuine fraternity the broad ba&s;is of the commonwealth, which I have imagined&mdash;was every individual clo&s;ely united in the bonds of af|fection, a reciprocity of good offices would be &s;tudi|ou&s;ly cultivated, a combination of efforts procured; and the archives of the corre&s;ponding &s;ecretary, being con&s;idered as the &s;acred repo&s;itory of every ingenious plan, or literary attempt, the united abilities of the wide exten&s;ive republic, thus concentrated, would be|come a magazine of rich materials, from which the beautiful and augu&s;t temple of arts and &s;ciences would attain a degree of perfection hitherto unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034162_0673_0FFC5499EE2E24C0">
It has been a general complaint, e&s;pecially among a particular cla&s;s of men, that genius has never, except in the &s;hort luminous intervals of one or two brilliant epochs, been advanced to that elevation, to which its rare qualities gave it an indi&s;putable claim; and yet, my memory, at this moment, furni&s;hes me with in|&s;tances, that render this hypothe&s;is rather problematic|al. Pindar, we are told, continued, almo&s;t a complete century, one of the brighte&s;t luminaries in the literary hemi&s;phere. Warriors of the fir&s;t de&s;cription, and &s;tate&s;men of the mo&s;t elevated rank, contended for his regards. His &s;acred poe&s;y was acknowledged by eve|ry order of the people&mdash;it filled the temples of the gods; and his divine odes, &s;ongs, and paeans re&s;ound|ed through the Delphian ai&s;les. The mini&s;ters of Apollo, erecting his &s;tatue, placed it among the mo&s;t con&s;picuous ornaments of their temple; and the Py|thean voice audibly pronounced, that one half of tho&s;e early fruit offerings, with which the pious Religioni&s;t, on each returning year, failed not to gratify the con|&s;ecrated attendants of the Delphian rites, &s;hould be regularly appropriated to him! Thus was the poet, while enrobed in mortality, inve&s;ted, by the voluntary arrangements of gratitude, with a participation of di|vine honours! and, when he a&s;cended to the cele&s;tial abodes, his remains were di&s;tingui&s;hed by every dem|on&s;tration of the high e&s;timation in which he was held. His fellow-citizens decreed, as a te&s;timonial of their veneration, the monumental pile; arti&s;ts combined their mo&s;t arduous efforts, and the beauty of the ceno|taph which aro&s;e in the hippodrome, and which was con&s;ecrated to the memory of Pindar, continued to ex|tort the admiration of every ob&s;erver, during &s;ix re|volving centuries. Nor was this all&mdash;his uncommon worth and &s;ingular abilities became the heritage of his de&s;cendants: In the days of Plutarch, the po&s;terity of the bard received a portion of the &s;acred victim. The hou&s;e which he had inhabited became a barrier to the vindictive progre&s;s of the enraged Spartans; and even the Macedonian chief did a kind of homage to this dwelling.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="034162_0674_0FFC549864F13EB0">
It is true, the fate of Homer may be oppo&s;ed to the &s;plendid fortunes of Pindar; but every thing relative to that prince of Grecian poe&s;y &s;eems to be envelop|ed by the thick folds of ob&s;curity. I remember once to have read a life of Homer, wherein I was informed that he received the name <HI>Homer</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Mele&s;igenes,</HI> by which he was originally de&s;ignated, in con&s;equence of his <HI>blindne&s;s;</HI> and yet, the &s;ame writer afterwards a&s;&s;erts, not only that <HI>&s;even cities</HI> contended for the honour of his birth, but al&s;o, that there were <HI>&s;even dif|ferent Homers,</HI> who lived at di&s;tant periods of time, and who&s;e abilities and fortunes were various. Query: <HI>Were the&s;e Homers all blind?</HI> Perhaps all that is cer|tain of the <HI>in&s;pired author</HI> of the Iliad, is, that his <HI>mental powers were unrivalled;</HI> and that his fame, col|lecting added lu&s;tre from each revolving age, hath thus evinced its <HI>unque&s;tionable right to immortality.</HI></P>
<P>Apelles received for his picture of Alexander, gra&s;p|ing a thunder-bolt, the full &s;um of four thou&s;and pounds. He &s;tood high in the favour of his &s;overeign, who &s;eemed to conceive &s;carce any gratification too liberal for talents &s;o con&s;picuous; even the beautiful Campa&s;pe was not withheld, and Apelles continued, through life, to enjoy all tho&s;e honours which his tran&s;|cendent abilities richly merited. But antiquity fur|ni&s;hes many proofs of the re&s;pect which was, in the early ages, paid to <HI>mind,</HI> and the high e&s;timation with which <HI>intellectual &s;uperiority</HI> was regarded; nor am I willing, ha&s;tily, to conclude that the moderns are wholly deficient in this particular.</P>
<P>The career of Addi&s;on was both honorary and lu|crative; and, from the fortunate moment which put a copy of his Latin ver&s;es into the hands of Dr. Lan|ca&s;ter, he &s;eems to be reaping all tho&s;e marks of ap|plau&s;e which were due to his genius and his appli|cation. That noble patron of letters, Sir John So|mers, the Macenas of the court in which he lived, obtained for Addi&s;on, from his &s;overeign, a pen&s;ion of &pound;. 300 per annum, to di&s;charge his travelling ex|pen&s;es,
<PB N="9" REF="034162_0675_0FFC5496D7DB96F8">
&s;ub&s;equent to which we find him the attendant of prince Eugene. He was rewarded for the celebrat|ed poem which he entitled the Campaign by Godol|phin&mdash;he accompanied lord Halifax to Andover&mdash;he was repeatedly &s;ecretary for the kingdom of Ireland&mdash;he was created one of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of trade&mdash;and la&s;tly, he obtained the po&s;t of Secretary of State.</P>
<P>The literary fame of Pope was equal to the warm|e&s;t expectations that ever bard, even in the moment of poetic frenzy, could have indulged; and his pe|cuniary emoluments al&s;o inve&s;ted him with a hand|&s;ome property. The &s;ub&s;criptions which he obtained for the tran&s;lation of the Iliad amounted to &pound;. 6000; and he received be&s;ide, from Linto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the book&s;eller, no le&s;s than &pound;.1200. After a patronage &s;o liberal, he purcha&s;ed his celebrated rece&s;s at Twickenham, where he realized the luxury of filial tenderne&s;s, &s;en|timental retirement, the independence to which he was ardently attached, and that kind of friend&s;hip which is the rich growth of di&s;intere&s;ted e&s;teem. Yet the literary annals of the Briti&s;h page recounts the &s;tory of a writer, of no incon&s;iderable celebrity, who ab&s;olutely yielded up his exi&s;tence for the want of that &s;upport &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to its endurance. But po&s;&s;i|bly, in this in&s;tance, <HI>economy</HI> and <HI>conduct</HI> might be wanting. Prudence is not always the appendage of genius; and the mo&s;t liberal benefactions may prove in&s;ufficient, if di&s;cretion is not con&s;ulted in their ap|propriation. Later times have given us an example in the per&s;on of the unfortunate Savage; the efforts of his friends, to place him in any degree of inde|pendence, were rendered ineffectual by his irregular conduct. Occa&s;ional large&s;&s;es but furni&s;hed the means of renewed imprudencies; and the pen&s;ion he receiv|ed from Queen Caroline was annually &s;quandered in a privacy, attended with circum&s;tances of ambigu|ity, from a knowledge of which his &s;en&s;e of propri|ety impelled him to exclude his mo&s;t intimate friends. But his ju&s;tly celebrated biographer realized all the &s;weets of an ea&s;y competency, accompanied by the &s;oothing reflection, that what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was &s;he

well earned reward of natural endowments, and of acquirements which perhaps have not frequently been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But whether the general &s;uffrage of mankind hath preponderated in favour of genius, I do not pre&s;ume to determine; my pre&s;ent object is only to e&s;tabli&s;h a per&s;ua&s;ion of the nece&s;&s;ity of a union of plans, and a combination of efforts, in order to the procurement of any de&s;irable end. It is with pain I have marked the operation of that rival&s;hip among the children of &s;cience, which too often terminates in a rooted aver&s;ion from each other. The acrimony and confirmed hatred of competitors, in any profe&s;&s;ion, is as unju&s;tifiable as it is injurious; and it is from a view of the alarming effects, too often con&s;equent on a &s;imilarity of preten|&s;ions, that I have taken the liberty to &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome general arrangements, which may open a line of communication, promote fraternity, and e&s;tabli&s;h confidence and affection.</P>
<P>I am aware, that, agreeably to the deci&s;ion of the Abb&eacute; Raynal, tho&s;e are attentions which ought to be regarded as wholly foreign from the contemplations of an American. According to that writer, the rays of genius never have, nor ever will, &s;hed their genial in|fluence on the benighted bo&s;om of a native of this younger world; puni&s;hed even <HI>beyond</HI> the <HI>fourth gen|eration</HI> for the crimes of their ance&s;tors, they are doom|ed, <HI>by the pen of this philo&s;opher,</HI> to experience an utter dereliction of all tho&s;e rare abilities, which could give them a title to enroll their names in the annals of fame! But tran&s;cendently excellent as was the Abb&eacute; Raynal, he was however cloathed in the habiliments of mortality; and while thus inve&s;ted, we are not to &s;tamp his ideas with the &s;eal of infallibility. America has given birth to philo&s;ophers, politicians, and war|riors of the fir&s;t de&s;cription; &s;he numbers al&s;o a long li&s;t of celebrated proficients in the polite arts&mdash;We&s;t, Copeley, and Trumbull, natives of her &s;oil, now take rank in the highe&s;t cla&s;s of their profe&s;&s;ion, on the Al|bion, &s;hore; and it is &s;aid <HI>their admired productions are

referred to, as a proof of the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of painting in the i&s;land of Great-Britain!</HI> We are fearful to give this article of information all the colouring of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible, le&s;t we &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to invigorate that cen&s;urable and acrimonious kind of rival&s;hip, we have profe&s;&s;ed a &s;olicitude to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>Apelles, when painters are <HI>the &s;ubject,</HI> will always be ob&s;erved as a prominent figure; and the fini&s;hed touches of his pencil were marked by the winged en|voys of fame. Yet did Apelles extend his regards to every competitor; he was con&s;cious of that &s;uperiority with which nature had endowed him; and he ingen|uou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed that he &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf without rival or imitator, in the gracefulne&s;s of his figures and atti|tudes; but, with that grandeur of &s;oul which in|volves a dete&s;tation of all unnece&s;&s;ary prevarication, he acknowledged his inferiority in many other branch|es of his art. For the purpo&s;e of viewing and admir|ing the performances of his cotemporary, Protogenes, he travelled to Rhodes. The <HI>fir&s;t rate</HI> talents of Pro|togenes would have blown up the pa&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y in a mind le&s;s liberal; but, di&s;daining to &s;ubmit to an impul&s;e &s;o ignoble, he transfu&s;ed into the brea&s;t of the arti&s;t the &s;entiments of laudable ambition. He drew him from his &s;olitude, enhanced the value of his pic|tures, and, pointing out to the Rhodians his elevated abilities, he extorted from them that applau&s;e, which, while they were lavi&s;h of their commendations of a &s;tranger, they had, until that period, denied to worth which was the growth of their own &s;oil.</P>
<P>Addi&s;on and Pope appear to have been, in &s;ome &s;ort, under the influence of a &s;pirit of literary acrimo|ny: Envy, it is but too obvious, more than glanced on their minds; and the murky clouds of di&s;cord, dim|med, for a moment, the pure lu&s;tre of two of the brighte&s;t luminaries in a con&s;tellation, which will con|tinue to irradiate the late&s;t ages. Of their di&s;union, po&s;terity will judge; partizans will enli&s;t upon either &s;ide; and it is left for the careful inve&s;tigator of lit|erary annals, to decide who was the aggre&s;&s;or, or with
<PB N="12" REF="034162_0678_0FFC548B49001B90">
whom the continuance of rancour remained. But the enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of Addi&s;on, will blu&s;h, while con|templating the accu&s;ation lodged again&s;t the elegant morali&s;t, whom he hath ever delighted to honour; he can &s;carcely believe him &s;u&s;ceptible of duplicity, or that he could po&s;&s;ibly, while de&s;canting on a meritori|ous production,
<Q><L>Damn with faint prai&s;e, a&s;&s;ent with civil leer,</L>
<L>And without &s;neering, teach the re&s;t to &s;neer!</L></Q>
If, however, the fact is inconte&s;tibly proved, and it is reduced to a certainty, that "<HI>Atticus is the man,</HI>" ge|nius it&s;elf will drop a tear, and the lover of dignified humanity will lament that the infirmity of a mind &s;o truly ennobled, had not been con&s;igned to oblivion.</P>
<P>As this, our &s;ixty-ninth number, may probably &s;tand accu&s;ed of incoherence, we take leave to &s;tate, <HI>in few words,</HI> a &s;ubject, the importance of which we have been labouring to impre&s;s.

&s;plendors which encircle nations, that have for many centuries been pre&s;&s;ing onward to the goal of eminence. Yet, however precipitate my wi&s;hes may be, &s;ober rea|&s;on convinces me, that every thing has its adole&s;cence, and that the maturing hand of time, and the &s;unny beams of invigorating applau&s;e, are requi&s;ite to bring forward the germ, which the blighting breath of ill|timed &s;everity may bla&s;t in its bud. Under this con|viction, I read with candour the American page, and I am &s;olicitous to receive, with the <HI>utmo&s;t indulgence,</HI> every literary attempt.</P>
<P>Uniformly open to the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, my regrets on account of the fate of a Comedy, which made its ap|pearance in the Theatre in Federal-Street, Bo&s;ton, in the winter of 1795, may be ea&s;ily imagined. I pre|tend not to write a critique on that play. <HI>I confe&s;s a partiality for the author, and I do not therefore hazard an opinion;</HI> yet I take leave to repeat a well known truth: the production has never been brought to the te&s;t; it was performed but once; the players were generally deficient in their parts; and more than one of the comedians confe&s;&s;ed, that they came on the &s;tage with &s;carce a recollection of the &s;entiment which they were to expre&s;s!! And yet this mutilated pre&s;entation has been deemed &s;ufficient to procure a deci&s;ion on the merit of the production!</P>
<P>I will own, that I have attended with &s;ome di&s;|plea&s;ure to comments, which were evidently the re|&s;ult of a want of information, and which were, never|thele&s;s, pronounced with all the peremptory warmth of rancorous critici&s;m. One coxcomb ob&s;erved, that the piece was nothing el&s;e but a &s;tring of tedious, in|&s;ipid, unconnected dialogues, without even the &s;malle&s;t <HI>ve&s;tige of de&s;ign,</HI> and that he found it altogether impo&s;|&s;ible to continue in the play-hou&s;e during its pre&s;enta|tion. A &s;econd wi&s;hed the author had not kept <HI>the den<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ument</HI> out of &s;ight until the la&s;t &s;cene in the la&s;t act! It would have been better, he &s;aid, if the cata&s;|trophe could have met the view of the audience <HI>at ev|ery turn,</HI> and thus given them an intere&s;t in, <HI>and pre|pared

<P>It &s;eems, that the feelings of the writer of this Dra|ma, depre&s;&s;ed by remarks of this de&s;cription, officiou&s;ly handed her both by friends and enemies, has declined the &s;econd pre&s;entation, which the ju&s;tice of the Man|ager honourably tendered her: Yet the Comedy, not|with&s;tanding the di&s;advantages under which it labour|ed, was certainly candidly received by the audience; and, de&s;irous to furni&s;h tho&s;e who have any degree of curio&s;ity, with an opportunity of examining for them|&s;elves, I have obtained permi&s;&s;ion to tran&s;cribe the manu&s;cript in que&s;tion, with a view to its obtaining a place in your periodical publication.</P>
<P>Your work is confe&s;&s;edly a Mi&s;cellany; and, as there can be no impropriety in your admitting, among the variety it contains, dramatic performances, you may probably find it convenient to give it a regular continuation through the numbers of the Gleaner.</P>
<P>The author of <HI>the Medium,</HI> di&s;gu&s;ted with an ap|pellation which has been &s;ufficiently productive of vex|ation, now entitles her Comedy "<HI>Virtue Triumphant;</HI>" and you will have the goodne&s;s to introduce it to the public by this appellation.</P>

<P>THE more I reflect, the more calamitous my &s;ituation appears! Methought my father's parting words amounted to a malediction!

<P>Good morning, Sir; have you prepared your written addre&s;s to your father?</P>

<P>No, We&s;ton. <STAGE>[&s;ighs deeply.]</STAGE></P>

<P>But was not this your intention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was, Sir; but feeling a growing apathy which I determine to encourage, I forbear to pro&s;ecute my de&s;ign. I am become fond of mi&s;ery, We&s;ton; I will woo it to my embraces, and it &s;hall henceforth be my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>A&s;toni&s;hing! Has Mi&s;s Clairville cea&s;ed to charm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! name her not&mdash;her brea&s;t is harder than adamant! Colder than the &s;now which tops the Alps&mdash;to warm her to the genial meltings of pity, is impo&s;&s;ible; and &s;he has no chords in her &s;oul attuned to &s;acred &s;ympathy.</P>

<SPEAKER>We&s;ton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Di&s;cretion is a rare accompli&s;hment in a maiden under twenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Di&s;cretion, We&s;ton! If &s;he was awake to tenderne&s;s, it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could be always thus wi&s;e. I tell thee, man, I have followed her upwards of two years; and, although I have watched her every movement, yet not one dear conceding moment, one propitious word, nor even an unguarded look, hath ever ble&s;t my ardent wi&s;hes! And yet, We&s;ton, I have not to accu&s;e her of pride, undue re&s;erve, nor incon|&s;i&s;tency&mdash;however &s;he manages it, for my &s;oul I can|not help acknowledging that her whole conduct &s;eems one uniform exemplification of dignified propriety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>We&s;ton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy if your preten&s;ions were &s;anctioned by your father, your difficulties would &s;peedily vani&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! We&s;ton, you are too &s;anguine! my father's active interference in my favour, is not to be expected; and if it were, the probability is, that this haughty beauty would &s;hrink from what her extreme delicacy would teach her to term an obligation.</P>
</SP>

<P>Forget her!! What, forget beauty, vir|tue, and all tho&s;e peerle&s;s accompli&s;hments that give their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or a claim to rank among cele&s;tials? For|bid it Heaven, forbid it love, and every tender &s;enti|ment, which in bands indi&s;&s;oluble &s;hall ever bind my heart to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>We&s;ton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you ever learned any thing from her, of her extraction or connexions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only general in&s;inuations, ingeniou&s;ly cal|culated, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, to damp the ardour of my pur&s;uit, and which have but &s;erved to add another rivet to tho&s;e chains that bind me eternally hers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>We&s;ton.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is truly politic: Were women but &s;en|&s;ible what charms unite in a candid, generous and frank deportment, even their love of &s;way would teach them to renounce the wily arts of deception.</P>

<P>News, old boy, what of news? Why thou looke&s;t plaguy glum.

<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not, Sir&mdash;Eliza Clairville po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more dignity of &s;entiment than any young per&s;on I have met with; &s;he is a high &s;oul'd girl, and has more of mind than commonly falls to the lot of mortality.</P>

<P>No, Sir; Eliza Clairville does not think &s;e|verely of wedded amity; &s;he re&s;pects, as &s;he ought, the &s;acred ties of mutual love; but when fate inter|po&s;es its in&s;urmountable bars, it &s;urely mu&s;t be con&s;id|ered as the height of folly, to be thus uncea&s;ingly at odds with de&s;tiny.</P>

<P>Dear Dorinda, I am mon&s;trou&s;ly happy to &s;ee you! I called at your lodgings <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> in the cour&s;e of a tour I have been making among the &s;hops, <HI>and was mortified to death at not finding you.</HI></P>

<P>You are a charming creature, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed: But it is a divine morning; and I have al|ready looked in on a little hundred of my friends.

<P>Dear Dorinda, I &s;econd your petition with genuine ardour; for I am a perfect enthu&s;ia&s;t in my admiration of tho&s;e ea&s;y manners, which are always the appendage of real gentility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then, for&s;ooth! there is an <HI>affectation of &s;entiment, which is altogether intolerable: "I &s;uppo&s;e, Mi&s;s Scornwell,</HI> <STAGE>[&s;peaks affectedly]</STAGE> <HI>you was pre&s;ent at the repre&s;entation of the Jew&mdash;Is it not a &s;weet play?&mdash;The Jew was a noble fellow, and Eliza Ratcliff was a mo&s;t intere&s;ting girl&mdash;it was replete with &s;entiment, and both my&s;elf and daughters were drown'd in tears."</HI></P>

<P>Not a &s;trong predilection in favour of &s;en|timent, Mi&s;s Scornwell! amazing!

<P>Well, well&mdash;I am not de&s;irous of quarrel|ing with Augu&s;ta for any thing. I was la&s;t night at

<P>O the frights! but he had eyes only for me. There was Mrs. Gadabout, mo&s;t prepo&s;terou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed, and Mi&s;s Trimwell, loaded with finery, while Betty Brilliant &s;eemed a moving jeweller's &s;hop.</P>

<P>I drew my fir&s;t breath in humble life&mdash;my parents commending me to the care of an opulent and noble family in England, left me an infant or|phan; and my only patrimony was their benediction. From the family in which I was thrown, I received an education which might have &s;uited royalty; but ere I had completed my fifteenth year, my patrone&s;s, the fir&s;t of women, &s;welled her la&s;t &s;igh!

<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I imagined him a bright exemplar of every virtue; but, forgetful of the ties of honour and the delicacy of my &s;ituation, he was capable of forming a deliberate &s;cheme of &s;eduction! and, while he a&s;&s;umed the gui&s;e of a tenderne&s;s truly paternal, he was cruelly plotting my ruin!!!</P>

<P>Excu&s;e me, Sir, but, in my humble opinion, there never was a more heavenly minded young lady; and I have &s;aid it a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times, that &s;he was the exact re&s;emblance of my young Ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>Yes, Sir; how you took the poor man out of pri&s;on; purcha&s;ed all his goods at auction; and, after re&s;toring both them and him to his wife and children, how you gave him a &s;um of money to begin bu&s;ine&s;s again: How you were con&s;tantly taking the part of the oppre&s;&s;ed. When I have told her all the&s;e things, and much more, Sir, &s;he would turn away to wipe off the tears, and then, lifting up her white hands and beautiful blue eyes to heaven, Robert, &s;ays &s;he, your Ma&s;ter is a good young man, and a ble&s;&s;ing will &s;urely attend him.</P>

<P>Well, Robert, we mu&s;t all &s;ubmit to ne|ce&s;&s;ity. Go, my good fellow, and de&s;ire Mr. We&s;ton to &s;tep hither.</P>

<P>Poor old man! I am not a&s;hamed to own that the parting with him is not the lea&s;t of my inqui|etudes. But my Eliza, exalted pattern of every ex|cellence! may Heaven &s;hield thy virtues: Surely the gifts of fortune are e&s;timated at the very lowe&s;t rate, when they are withheld from merit &s;o tran&s;cendent, and profu&s;ely &s;howered on vice and folly.</P>

conceived a kind of prejudice again&s;t the per&s;on, to whom he imputes a de&s;ign, which he imagines &s;o ill advi&s;ed. There is &s;ome allowance due to years, Sir.</P>

<P>Undoubtedly. Poor fellow, I would glad|ly dry his tears&mdash;I always feel compa&s;&s;ion for per&s;ons in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude and dependence, Mr. Maitland.</P>

<P>You are perfectly right, Sir.</P>

<P>Your &s;ervant, Mr. Maitland, has an added claim to my attention; old age, and grief, are power|ful recommendations to that heart, which hath been long a proficient in the &s;chool of affliction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often been fearful that your bo&s;om harboured &s;ome latent cau&s;e of grief; and our la&s;t con|ver&s;ation, without explaining the nature of your mis|fortunes, has confirmed my &s;u&s;picions, given me a very important intere&s;t in your happine&s;s, and originated a wi&s;h that I could be any how in&s;trumental in produc|ing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are truly friendly; but, as the knowl|edge of my misfortunes can be of no immediate im|port, it may &s;uffice to &s;ay that I am unhappy; that I wander from place to place without dimini&s;hing my &s;orrow, and that I hardly expect a remedy this &s;ide the grave.</P>

<P>Nay, the probability is, that the accu&s;a|tion of impertinence will devolve upon me; for, I am induced to put a que&s;tion, which only a long and ap|proved friend&s;hip can ju&s;tify.

<P>Alas! Sir, my father will not &s;ee my Eli|za; and, if he could even be brought to con&s;ent to our union, it is more than probable Mi&s;s Clairville would reject our united &s;upplications; for, while &s;he has, in the mo&s;t unequivocal terms, avowed her preference, &s;he has, <HI>with the &s;ame breath, declared that &s;he will never meet me at the altar, but on equal ground.</HI></P>

<P>If the tender bo&s;om of my amiable friend has ever been intere&s;ted by the perturbed &s;en&s;ations of an impa&s;&s;ioned attachment; if &s;he can <HI>experimentally</HI> decide on the tyranny of the de&s;pot Love, <HI>even when &s;ucce&s;s awaits his progre&s;s,</HI> &s;he will be able to form an idea of the &s;en&s;ations of that heart in which hope is almo&s;t extinct, and her fair hand will be lent to ex|tricate an unhappy man whom de&s;pair hath nearly engulphed.</P>

<Q><L>The hero's &s;oul, by dauntle&s;s valour nerv'd,</L>
<L>From honour's radiant path hath never &s;werv'd;</L>
<L>Brave though he is, yet judgment points his way,</L>
<L>And peaceful coun&s;els in his bo&s;om &s;way.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>PERHAPS there is not, in the whole catalogue of ma&s;culine virtues, a more de&s;irable attainment, than that <HI>&s;y&s;tematic bravery,</HI> which is the re&s;ult of prin|ciples, deduced from a <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>philo&s;ophical view of the propriety of tho&s;e arrangements, con&s;equent on the agen|cy of a pre&s;cient and all-wi&s;e Fir&s;t Cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The true hero enters the field of battle with intrepid valour&mdash;his innate &s;erenity of mind is produced by a regular and well dige&s;ted train of reflections&mdash;with a degree of tranquillity, beyond the reach of accident, he mounts the breach, and, with manly firmne&s;s, he leads on the martial band&mdash;the alacrity of his move|ments are obvious; and, with fortitude unappalled, he prepares to meet the foe&mdash;innumerable deaths &s;ur|round, yet he continues uniformly &s;edate&mdash;he devi|ates not to the right, nor to the left; but, to more than probable de&s;truction, he marches on, and the language of his conduct &s;eems to be: "To die is not an evil; when found in the bed of honour, it is even eligible. As death is a <HI>natural,</HI> it is, <HI>therefore, a beneficial event:</HI> If I am under the guidance of a <HI>&s;upreme, all-wi&s;e, and all-gracious Being,</HI> his regulations in regard to me, mu&s;t be replete with judgment, rectitude and mercy. To die is the lot of humanity; the pre&s;ent mode of exi&s;tence mu&s;t terminate; and every man, at &s;ome pe|riod or other, mu&s;t inevitably &s;ubmit to the pangs of di&s;&s;olution. Let me, then, meet the angel of death, while engaged in a laudable pur&s;uit; I &s;hall only be removed from one &s;cene of things to another; the curtain will ari&s;e upon a higher order of beings; and I &s;hall &s;till continue under the cognizance of a pater|nal Creator. Honour demands my attendance in ho&s;|tile
<PB N="89" REF="034162_0755_0FFC53AB91DA6B58">
fields; let me, then, cheerfully obey: The voice of my country hath called me forth; the career is meritorious; glory beams its mo&s;t tran&s;cendent rays; and, at the de&s;tined goal, I &s;hall receive my laurel crown. Avaunt! then, every gha&s;tly &s;pectre; nor pre&s;ume to pervade, by the chaotic influence of di&s;or|ganizing he&s;itation, the region of my imagination. Length of days are not <HI>principally</HI> to be de&s;ired&mdash;let me rather devote my life to the &s;ervice of tho&s;e with whom I &s;tand connected&mdash;let me rather dignify the term of my probation, by achievements which de&s;erve to be immortalized! In a righteous cau&s;e I have drawn my &s;word&mdash;if I fall, my exit is both expected and honorary, and I am prepared to meet my fate&mdash;if I e&s;cape, it &s;hall be my care to a&s;certain the ju&s;tice of my claim to the warrior's meed, and Fame's loud clarion &s;hall re&s;ound my deeds of arms!"</P>
<P>Thus, come life, come death&mdash;tranquillity is the he|ro's portion; integrity pre&s;ides in his bo&s;om, and val|our is his birth-right: He goeth forth to the battle, and his countrymen, his friends, and his brethren, fall around!&mdash;Humanity drops a tear&mdash;but fortitude is &s;till an invulnerable &s;hield; while, undi&s;mayed by dan|ger, and beyond the reach of per&s;onal apprehen&s;ion, he triumphs in the mid&s;t of &s;laughter; and if, at length, the mi&s;&s;ive weapon urged again&s;t his life, &s;hould transfix, by a mortal wound, he &s;miles beneath the icy darts of death&mdash;his equanimity is &s;till the &s;ame; and with placid compo&s;ure he will re&s;ign his breath. Such are the endowments he ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s, who en|tereth on a military career.</P>
<P>The true hero is al&s;o a uniform patriot&mdash;his ambi|tion is circum&s;cribed by the public weal; and &s;o well doth he love his country, that, although he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the &s;oul of valour, yet, if the councils of peace are dic|tated by, and con&s;i&s;t with honour, he will embrace them as his chief <HI>de&s;ideratum.</HI> He loves, and he will protect his country&mdash;her emolument is the <HI>ultimatum</HI> of his wi&s;hes; but &s;till he is a citizen of the world, and the wounds of humanity transfix his &s;en&s;ibility.
<PB N="90" REF="034162_0756_0FFC53A8EC576CD8">
He is the guardian of the people's rights&mdash;but he gird|eth not on the &s;word, except the manife&s;to of their grievances is &s;tamped by the broad &s;eal of ju&s;tice. A well regulated government is the &s;overeign dictator of all his actions&mdash;his arrangements are the re&s;ult of or|der, and his appeal is to the laws which are ordained. He loves his country&mdash;but he is not &s;olicitous to en|large her boundaries&mdash;he remembers that Rome, when &s;he &s;tyled her&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, was not, in fact, more re&s;pectable than when her lu&s;t of domina|tion was confined within a narrower circumference. He is not actuated by that wild ambition, which, with maddening influence, urged the baleful progre&s;s of the Macedonian chief&mdash;he feels no Robe&s;pierian thir&s;t for human blood&mdash;he will never cry havoc, but when hard nece&s;&s;ity compels&mdash;nor will he, but in the la&s;t ex|tremity, let loo&s;e the dogs of war. Thus, while every circum&s;tance of his life evinceth the energy of that <HI>amor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> which gloweth in his bo&s;om, the broad philanthropy of his di&s;po&s;ition is &s;till proclaiming him the friend of man.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ion of arms is u&s;eful and re&s;pectable. The Patriot Warrior is de&s;ervedly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;teem of mankind; and, if he acts a con&s;i&s;tent part, he is an ornament to human nature. It is in this walk that a WASHINGTON, the illu&s;trious Hero of this younger world, hath reaped undying laurels! and his immortal deeds illume, with new-born &s;plendors, the brave man's path!</P>
<P>His early virtues authorized the mo&s;t &s;plendid predic|tions; and, although &s;eque&s;tered in his fir&s;t years amid his native &s;hades, the neighbourhood of his Vernonian groves contained the only witne&s;&s;es of his youthful prog|re&s;s; yet, from the &s;tudies in which he was engaged, re|&s;ulted the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial and be&s;t kind of information, while the u&s;eful and the plea&s;ing enriched and adorn|ed his mind. The mountain breeze endowed him with the glow of health; and he procured, from the plea&s;urable and &s;alutary toils which diver&s;ified the en|chanting &s;cenes of rural life, a firm robu&s;t con&s;titu|tion,
<PB N="91" REF="034162_0757_0FFC53A767A27048">
expanded limbs, and a graceful, maje&s;tic, and well proportioned exterior.</P>
<P>His filial piety was early evinced. At that period of ardent expectancy, when the vivid buds of hope be|gan to unfold their tender leaves; when tip-toe imag|ination a&s;&s;umed its riche&s;t colouring, and the opening pro&s;pect was arrayed in the mo&s;t &s;plendid hues; ju&s;t as the intere&s;ting youth had attained his fifteenth year, <HI>although entered, under the mo&s;t favourable au&s;pices,</HI> on board a &s;hip of war, and only not embarked&mdash;in a moment &s;o critical, he was withheld from the event|ful pur&s;uit, by the tender remon&s;trances of a mother, who, not availing her&s;elf of the authority with which nature had inve&s;ted her, conde&s;cended to employ the language of entreaty. Soon, however, the venerable matron called into action that Grecian firmne&s;s, which was inherent in her bo&s;om; and the youthful hero, while engaging in the military career, was enriched by the maternal benediction.</P>
<P>How honorary were his fir&s;t on&s;ets! and how &s;trik|ingly did they evince the unequalled abilities, that gave him an indi&s;putable claim to tho&s;e united &s;uf|frages, which have &s;o repeatedly proclaimed him the <HI>Man of the People</HI>&mdash;the man who de&s;erved, and who hath received, both the military and the civic wreath.</P>
<P>Illu&s;trious citizen! how faultle&s;s and how glorious are the &s;plendid tran&s;actions which have marked and dignified thy eventful life! What American but mu&s;t delight to trace the gradual &s;teps, by which thou ha&s;t advanced to thy pre&s;ent, <HI>perhaps unparalleled, eminence!</HI> Viewed in the aggregate, or in detached in&s;tances, thy admini&s;tration mu&s;t furni&s;h the bo&s;om of every contem|plative Columbian with immea&s;urable complacency! A glow of con&s;cious exultation pervades reflection&mdash;thou art our countryman! we claim kindred with thy worth; and we derive a kind of re&s;pectability from this national affinity! Let us <HI>trace</HI> and <HI>retrace&mdash;the theme is rich&mdash;its intere&s;t to an American ear will &s;till accumulate; and revolving ages will confe&s;s it inex|hau&s;tible!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="034162_0758_0FFC53A3A553B1D0">
It was a happy moment, in which our venerable legi&s;lators hailed a Wa&s;hington, as Commander in Chief of the forces of United America! Armed with the weapons of defence, and girding on the &s;word of power, his progre&s;s was a&s;toni&s;hing, and his achieve|ments truly important! Confu&s;ion fled at his ap|proach; di&s;cipline ranged it&s;elf under his banners; order pre&s;ided in his arrangements; and &s;imple, un|trained villagers became a regular army of brave, pa|tient, and effective &s;oldiers! The termination of the fir&s;t campaign was worthy of the <HI>philanthropic &s;oldier;</HI> and HUMANITY will record tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, which reduced the Briti&s;h to the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of yielding up the metropolis of the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, <HI>without the effu&s;ion of a &s;ingle drop of blood,</HI> among the foremo&s;t of his deeds of worth. But every thing was to be ex|pected from a Chief &s;o amply endowed by nature, and who blended with the <HI>fir&s;t abilities,</HI> that <HI>prudent caution</HI> &s;o requi&s;ite in the catalogue of a <HI>&s;oldier's virtues</HI>&mdash;who, while he was never <HI>arrogant</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;uming,</HI> was, on every great occa&s;ion, <HI>nobly firm</HI> and <HI>becomingly dignified.</HI></P>
<P>The be&s;t principles of philo&s;ophy were early im|planted in his bo&s;om. His <HI>pa&s;&s;ions, all arranged by rea|&s;on, were kept in uniform &s;ubjection.</HI> He knew no party; and again&s;t the inroads of prejudice he erected the &s;tronge&s;t barriers. He was incapable of illiberal views or conclu&s;ions; and his movements, ever dictated by a &s;ound under&s;tanding and a well regulated judgment, were invariably marked by propriety. Accu&s;tomed accurately to inve&s;tigate, he became familiar with both the <HI>probable</HI> and the <HI>po&s;&s;ible.</HI> He under&s;tood the rela|tive concurrence of events, and was, in a good degree, prepared for the con&s;equences of the mea&s;ures which he adopted. Always contemplative, his faculties were habituated to exerci&s;e; and hence his mind became invigorated and capacious, while he acquired the power of readily recognizing truth, and of embracing, in the mid&s;t of difficulties, the mo&s;t &s;alutary and extricating expedients. To this effect is the &s;ketch, which tho&s;e, who are the be&s;t informed, have given of the <HI>Hero of
<PB N="93" REF="034162_0759_0FFC53A119315740">
this new world;</HI> and the &s;plendor of his career hath &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;trains of eulogy!</P>
<P>His reply to the annunciation of his appointment to the con&s;picuous and honorary &s;tation, to which the combining &s;uffrages of his country had elevated him, while it is amiably ingenuous and truly noble, is al&s;o evincive of una&s;&s;uming worth and intere&s;ting diffidence. Mode&s;ty is a gem, which, advantageou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, may &s;parkle becomingly, even among the a&s;&s;emblage of manly virtues; and it frequently diffu&s;eth a lu&s;tre over the brave&s;t exploits! Illu&s;trious man! admira|tion is ta&s;ked, when &s;eeking to clothe, in language ad|equate to their &s;plendor, the matchle&s;s deeds which have marked a life &s;o fraught with u&s;efulne&s;s! It is not a&s;toni&s;hing, that his election to office was unani|mous&mdash;it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that he was received, by all orders of people, with every demon&s;tration of applau&s;e, nor, that the army, in particular, evinced their confi|dence by the mo&s;t unequivocal acclamations of joy.</P>

<P>HOW prodigious mu&s;t have been tho&s;e talents, which were capable of conducting and effectu|ating in a part of the country, to which the hero had been recently introduced, "within mu&s;ket-&s;hot of twenty Briti&s;h regiments, the di&s;banding of one army, and the enli&s;tment of another!" But the path of this new &s;tar in the military hemi&s;phere, &s;eemeth to have been literally progre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>All eyes were toward him; and every tongue was emboldened to expre&s;s the various &s;entiments of an ex|ten&s;ive and a fluctuating populace, which, ignorant that their army was, in many in&s;tances, de&s;titute of
<PB N="94" REF="034162_0760_0FFC539BCBBB47D8">
arms and ammunition, pre&s;umptuou&s;ly dictated mea&s;|ures that, if adopted, would have in&s;ured immediate de&s;truction; and they ungratefully a&s;cribed improper motives to the Commander of their forces, (who, from rea&s;ons of the &s;ounde&s;t policy, concealed the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his &s;oldiers) becau&s;e he did not ru&s;h to an in&s;tant, and probably fatal, deci&s;ion!! But the Patriot War|rior loved his country; and, <HI>more firm</HI> than the Roman Fabius, he di&s;dained to &s;ubmit, <HI>even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a day,</HI> to the ill-informed impetuo&s;ity of an imperious multitude. His reputation was at &s;take&mdash;but his mind was truly noble; and, with inherent magnanimity, while a&s;&s;ur|ed of his mea&s;ures, he <HI>&s;ilently</HI> &s;ubmitted to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tulent reflections of invidious and injudicious men! How indi&s;putably did he merit tho&s;e te&s;timonials of appro|bation, which marked his entrance into Bo&s;ton! The voice of a <HI>re&s;cued</HI> and <HI>gratulating</HI> people&mdash;Can &s;trains more enchantingly &s;weet vibrate on the hero's ear? To be hailed as the DELIVERER of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and almo&s;t de&s;pairing fellow-citizens&mdash;What <HI>car-borne</HI> vic|tor ever de&s;erved or enjoyed a <HI>triumph</HI> more truly, more affectingly elevating! The general a&s;&s;embly of the Union applauded, and the concentrated voice of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts thus addre&s;&s;ed him: "<HI>May you &s;till go on, approved by Heaven, revered by all good men, and dreaded by the&s;e tyrants, who claim their fellow-men as their property.</HI>"</P>
<P>Thus wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">d forward, he proceeded on, nobly per|&s;evering, amid circum&s;tances of the mo&s;t depre&s;&s;ing a&s;pect. Innumerable were the difficulties and hard|&s;hips with which he was condemned to &s;truggle; alarming di&s;appointments of many high-rai&s;ed expec|tations, general dejection, and an almo&s;t total defection of re&s;ources! What mu&s;t have been the feelings of the <HI>Patriot Warrior,</HI> on the repeated de&s;ertions, &s;o di&s;|graceful to the American character, which, at &s;ome di&s;a&s;trous periods, were the events of every hour! How mu&s;t he have agonized, while witne&s;&s;ing the uni|ver&s;al gloom pourtrayed in the countenances of his reduced troops&mdash;"<HI>the militia departing in whole compa|nies,
<PB N="95" REF="034162_0761_0FFC539A3926C0A8">
and their example infecting the regular regiments,</HI>" while &s;ubjected, by the nece&s;&s;ity of retreating, to the mo&s;t mortifying &s;en&s;ations, and forbid by prudence to exonerate him&s;elf from the defamatory remarks, originating in tho&s;e inevitable movements! Yet, by that innate probity which ever maintained its regency in his bo&s;om, he was once more rendered greatly &s;u|perior to the ills that encompa&s;&s;ed him; and, confi|dent that his line of conduct would be&s;t conduce to the accompli&s;hment of that independence, at which America ju&s;tly aimed, he calmly &s;ubmitted to a mo|mentary envelopment, anticipating the elucidating cri&s;is, which, withdrawing the veil, would pre&s;ent cau&s;es and effects in their true point of view.</P>
<P>Cowardice, al&s;o, dared to produce among the ranks of freemen, its da&s;tardly adherents!! O WASHING|TON! what were the conflicts of thy heroic &s;pirit, at that portentous era, when all thy rhetoric was em|ployed in vain&mdash;when both thy example and thy au|thority were ineffectual to the rallying tho&s;e <HI>panic-&s;truck men,</HI> who abandoned thee in thy utmo&s;t extremity!!! It cannot be matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that, in a moment &s;o tremendous, thou wert de&s;erted by thy wonted &s;ereni|ty&mdash;that the calm region of thy bo&s;om became unu|&s;ually tempe&s;ted, and, that the hurricane within well near pro&s;trated the barriers of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t intere&s;ting period of the American revo|lution, and the effect of the&s;e calamitous events on the mind of her hero, is &s;trikingly &s;ketched by the hi&s;tori|an: "The General having embarked in the Ameri|can cau&s;e <HI>from the pure&s;t principles,</HI> viewed, with infi|nite concern, a behaviour &s;o &s;hameful! His &s;oul was harrowed up with apprehen&s;ions, that his country would be conquered, her army di&s;graced, and her lib|erties de&s;troyed. He anticipated, in imagination, that the Americans would appear to po&s;terity in the light of high-&s;ounding boa&s;ters, who blu&s;tered when danger was at a di&s;tance, but &s;hrunk at the &s;hadow of oppo&s;i|tion. Exten&s;ive confi&s;cations, and numerous attain|ders, pre&s;ented them&s;elves in full view to his agitated
<PB N="96" REF="034162_0762_0FFC5396EC7879C8">
mind. He &s;aw, in imagination, new formed States, with the means of defence in their hands, and the glo|rious pro&s;pect of liberty before them, levelled to the du&s;t. Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e ideas, he hazarded his per|&s;on, for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, in rear of his own men, and in front of the enemy, with his hor&s;e's head toward the latter, as if in expectation, that, by an honourable death, he might e&s;cape the infamy he dreaded from the da&s;tardly conduct of troops, on whom he could place no dependence." To this hu|miliating and di&s;piriting 15th of September, 1776, &s;ucceeded a train of calamities; for, although the di&s;|mayed &s;oldiers, in one gallant action, retrieved their military fame, misfortune, with baleful wing, &s;till brooded over the American &s;tandard. Unutterable was the di&s;tre&s;s of the hero; and his embarra&s;&s;ments and regrets, when retreating with his few remaining followers, de&s;titute and forlorn, without the means of procuring the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;aries of life, mu&s;t have exceeded even the powers of conception! "Scarce an inhabitant of the towns through which he pa&s;&s;ed, could be induced to join his almo&s;t de&s;erted &s;tandards, while he beheld numbers daily flocking to the royal army, to make their peace and obtain protection. When he contemplated on the one &s;ide, a numerous, well appointed, and full clad army, dazzling the eyes of the &s;oldiers with the elegance of uniformity, and on the other, a few poor fellows meanly cloathed, &s;inking under the pre&s;&s;ure of accumulated wants, and flying for their &s;afety, what words can de&s;cribe his <HI>augmented</HI> &s;ufferings, as he thus witne&s;&s;ed the American army re|linqui&s;hing its General&mdash;the people giving up the cau&s;e&mdash;&s;ome of the leaders going over to the enemy&mdash;and the Briti&s;h commanders &s;ucceeding in every en|terprize!"</P>
<P>But the Genius of Columbia, and of Wa&s;hington, at length aro&s;e triumphant! It &s;uddenly pierced the den&s;e clouds which had &s;o long ob&s;cured its radiance! Trenton and Princeton fir&s;t experienced its re&s;u&s;citating influence&mdash;brilliant was its progre&s;s&mdash;and augu&s;t the
<PB N="97" REF="034162_0763_0FFC539370785B10">
arrangement, which, in the mo&s;t critical conjuncture, &s;tationed the hero betwixt the contending parties! See! he marches on to death or victory! his exhorta|tions and his example are now gloriou&s;ly influential! The &s;oldiers bravely follow, and incalculable advantages are obtained!&mdash;deci&s;ive con&s;equences en&s;ue&mdash;captivat|ed towns are evacuated&mdash;the clouds are rapidly di&s;|per&s;ing&mdash;and the <HI>&s;un of liberty,</HI> with genial influence, once more expands the tender buds of hope!&mdash;But, to de&s;cant upon the merits, the hard&s;hips, and the &s;plendid and &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ervices of a Wa&s;hington, vol|umes are in&s;ufficient!</P>
<P>Truly arduous was his ta&s;k. "To pre&s;erve order," &s;ays the narrator of his actions, "and &s;ubordination, in an army of free republicans, even when well fed, clothed and paid, would have been a work of diffi|culty&mdash;But to retain them in &s;ervice, and re&s;train them with di&s;cipline, when de&s;titute, not only of the comforts, but often of the nece&s;&s;aries, of life, requires addre&s;s and abilities of &s;uch magnitude, as are rare|ly found in human nature. In this choice of difficul|ties, General Wa&s;hington not only kept his army to|gether, but conducted with &s;o much di&s;cretion, as to command the approbation, both of the army and of the citizens."</P>
<P>Glorious meed! May the benign rays of gratitude, cheri&s;hed through the&s;e emancipated States, ever gild the laurels which it entwines. Every true American, pa&s;&s;ing on from the&s;e &s;ucce&s;s crowned &s;cenes, will hail with pious rapture the memorable day which placed the Patriot Warrior at the head of the&s;e infant repub|lics.

<P>IT is a melancholy truth, that the be&s;t minds, when outraged by injuries, and rendered callous by a &s;e|ries of unmerited misfortunes, too often become the
<PB N="100" REF="034162_0766_0FFC5815338C55B8">
receptacles of inflexible au&s;terity. The virtuous phi|lanthropi&s;t, urged by his ardent love of mankind, paints individuals agreeably to his &s;en&s;e of moral rectitude; he hath imaged in his mind a plea&s;ing model, he de|lineates the virtues which he conceives attainable, he is &s;olicitous for the elevation of the human character; what he wi&s;hes, he con&s;iders as practicable; and, adopting an admea&s;urement of accompli&s;hments that rarely ever exi&s;t, he is continually &s;ubjected to di&s;ap|pointment, and that kind of di&s;gu&s;t, which terminates in a cynical arrangement of tho&s;e propen&s;ities that were originally replete with the be&s;t affections of which humanity is &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P>The little narrative, &s;elected as the &s;ubject of this Gleaner, is a &s;triking proof that mi&s;anthropy obtains its mo&s;t rampant growth in the &s;oil of virtue; that misfortunes are its manure, the impa&s;&s;ioned &s;ighs of angui&s;h its genial atmo&s;phere, and the torrents de|&s;cending on the cheek of woe its fertilizing &s;howers.</P>
<P>Octavian was a youth, who&s;e dawn of being au|thorized the highe&s;t expectations; amid an a&s;&s;emblage of the mo&s;t brilliant qualities, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that endear|ing benevolence and tenderne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, which would become tho&s;e attendant &s;eraphs appointed to hover round the children of mortality. The young philanthropi&s;t was an enthu&s;ia&s;t in his attachment to his &s;pecies, and he was fond of believing their virtues inherent, and their vices the re&s;ult of ca&s;ualty or for|eign agency. His education was truly judicious, and every year &s;erved to advance and to ameliorate tho&s;e rare qualities that enriched his mind. His &s;en&s;ibility was extreme; and the ardour of a luxuriant fancy taught him to regard this globe as a paradi&s;e, and its inhabitants as admini&s;tering &s;pirits, ordained as aids to each other. Even rea&s;on &s;eemed to quaff the intox|icating draught; and as his fine under&s;tanding was embelli&s;hed by a plea&s;ingly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing exterior, and the demi&s;e of his excellent parents had early made him the entire ma&s;ter of a very hand&s;ome property, per&s;ons were not wanting, who, by the exerci&s;e of cap|tivating
<PB N="101" REF="034162_0767_0FFA66119B3A2760">
urbanity, contributed to heighten and to con|tinue the &s;weet delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus accompli&s;hed, and thus circum&s;tanced, did the young Octavian commence the eventful career of life. Honour, highly wrought, and glowing with the mo&s;t liberal purpo&s;es, was created the ma&s;ter &s;pring of ev|ery movement; while rich in con&s;cious worth, and e&s;timating per&s;ons and things by his own feelings, he &s;eemed to tread enchanted ground, gaily anticipat|ing more happine&s;s than the calculation of experience would a&s;&s;ign to a million of mortal lives. He looked around, and the wide exten&s;ive globe, with the blue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|rene of heaven, alike con&s;pired to &s;well his heart with ineffable rapture; his path was &s;trewed with flowers; plea&s;ures, laudable in their &s;ource, were the compan|ions of his days; and from the far di&s;tant haunts, and &s;ituations the mo&s;t barren, he indu&s;triou&s;ly extracted a motive for complacency. Thus enchantingly the lu|cid vi&s;ion &s;wam before him; &s;u&s;picion &s;lept in its cav|erns; friend&s;hip a&s;&s;umed its mo&s;t benign a&s;pect; and love, garbed in all the captivating allurements of youth and beauty, unveiled before him its bewitching fea|tures; the irre&s;i&s;tibly commanding pa&s;&s;ions a&s;&s;erted their inborn vigour, and every faculty was engaged. Nature, when &s;he attuned his heart to the refinements of amity, rendered him al&s;o capable of the tender pa&s;|&s;ion in its utmo&s;t extreme, and its ungovernable emo|tions and delicious tumults ru&s;hed forcibly on his per|ception; a vi&s;ion of halcyon days &s;ucceeded; freely he indulged the dream of fancy; and, without a &s;ingle pau&s;e of di&s;cretion, he wedded the young, the gay, the beauteous <HI>Me&s;&s;alina,</HI> incautiou&s;ly entwining tho&s;e bands which were to en&s;ure felicity, or to tinge with the blacke&s;t hues his future de&s;tiny!</P>
<P>But Octavian he&s;itated not to affirm, that he had attained the &s;ummit of bli&s;s; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, the catalogue of his enjoyments was ample; virtuous, rich, &s;entimental, enamoured with the world, ble&s;t with a cho&s;en friend, whom he conceived attached to him by every tie which the mo&s;t cordial amity could
<PB N="102" REF="034162_0768_0FFA6618FA456778">
throw about the heart; and, to complete the picture, wedded to a female who had been followed by a crowd of candidates for her favour, who <HI>apparently</HI> returned his tenderne&s;s with equal ardours, and who&s;e move|ments &s;eemed the re&s;ult of di&s;cretion; was there a good which Octavian po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not?&mdash;Once more he turned his admiring gaze, and the face of contentment gladdened his eye, while the voice of congratulation vibrated &s;weetly on his ear. He had been accu&s;tomed to embrace <HI>appearances</HI> as <HI>realities;</HI> and while benefi|cence acquired new energy in his bo&s;om, again he ble&s;&s;ed the cele&s;tial countenance of humanity.</P>
<P>In this delirium &s;ome months rolled away; but the child of pro&s;perity generally becomes a mark for the envenomed &s;hafts of the invidious. <HI>Envy &s;et on foot her machinations&mdash;injurious reports were whi&s;pered</HI>&mdash;the feel|ings of Octavian were wounded, and the darts were urged by tho&s;e on who&s;e <HI>good offices he had fondly calculated.</HI> Friend&s;hip, truth and honour, he no longer &s;uppo&s;es them the inmates of every bo&s;om, and &s;u&s;picion rankled in his brea&s;t. He traced the tale of &s;candal, and &s;ome <HI>oblique hints</HI> glanced on the faith of that <HI>early friend,</HI> whom, from the fir&s;t dawn of rea&s;on, he had cheri&s;hed as his life's rich trea&s;ure. For a moment he became petrified by the <HI>intimation,</HI> while horror aimed at his peace an icy dart. Alas! from that fatal period the dark pa&s;&s;ions were all unchained: Mi&s;tru&s;t, a&s;&s;uming the a&s;cendency, commenced its regency, and the ob&s;er|vations of &s;o indefatigable and eagle eyed a &s;crutator produced a conviction of the blacke&s;t perfidy. The di&s;covery was, however, gradual; at fir&s;t, prevarica|tion, equivocal or hollow appearances of kindne&s;s, a manife&s;t declination of wonted attentions, the ardours of attachment indi&s;putably &s;ub&s;iding, the total di&s;|appearance of tho&s;e hone&s;t tran&s;ports which had &s;well|ed each glowing feature, e&s;trangement &s;ucceeding, the &s;ilken bands of amity, "<HI>&s;tring after &s;tring,</HI>" by cold re&s;erve, "<HI>were &s;evered,</HI>" the habits of generous confidence gave place to icy di&s;tance, and the agoniz|ing era at length pre&s;ented, when in&s;ult, contemptu|ous
<PB N="103" REF="034162_0769_0FFA664D5277E3D8">
di&s;dain, and barbarous ridicule keenly pointed the perfidy, which thus beyond a doubt was demon&s;trated. The injuries Octavian had received were mo&s;t atro|cious; under the &s;acred name of friend&s;hip, the aban|doned wretch whom he had tru&s;ted had &s;educed the too credulous Me&s;&s;alina! who, becoming an ea&s;y prey to the de&s;troyer, imbibed with avidity his licentious principles; while abundantly more criminal than the well known Ninon de L'Enclo&s;e, (who broke no &s;ol|emn vows) her amours were notoriou&s;ly multifarious, and caprice was ordained di&s;tributor of her guilty favours!!!</P>
<P>Poor Octavian! who but mu&s;t weep his unmerited fate! <HI>The world, on which he leaned,</HI> has pierced him through with many &s;orrows; from what an eminence is he precipitated! how hath his golden dream of hap|pine&s;s vani&s;hed! how agonizing is the void in his bo&s;|om! All el&s;e he might have borne&mdash;but to the over|whelming force of a calamity &s;o deeply aggravated, what Stoic fortitude could have remained inacce&s;&s;ible? In that tremendous hour, which gave indubitable con|viction of the infidelity of the deluded Me&s;&s;alina, what conflicting emotions, what &s;oul harrowing pa&s;|&s;ions were concentrated! There, where his confiding heart had fondly tru&s;ted, where he had accumulated his be&s;t and deare&s;t wi&s;hes! &s;he, who was the object of his unbounded admiration, who he was po&s;itive united every thing which he believed of virtue, who was the univer&s;e to him!!&mdash;Suddenly conviction was forced upon him; the ties of love are rudely torn a&s;under, and the cup of felicity is da&s;hed from his lips! Octavian &s;aw him&s;elf alone in the world; an object of tru&s;t exi&s;ted not; thick darkne&s;s enveloped his mind, and he &s;ickened at the journey of life! Di|ve&s;ted of motive, the vigour of exertion expired, and the blandi&s;hments of hope were at an end. The con|&s;equences were natural; for while retro&s;pection was replete with all the angui&s;h of regret, the pencil of fu|turity was employed in &s;ketching vi&s;ions the mo&s;t dark and comfortle&s;s; and the con&s;tant recurrence of
<PB N="104" REF="034162_0770_0FFA664FCC131080">
memory to tho&s;e gaudy vi&s;ions, which had &s;o deeply impo&s;ed on the confiding morning of his exi&s;tence, loudly proclaimed in the ear of his under&s;tanding, that &s;u&s;picion, ever on duty, was the only guard he could oppo&s;e to the ba&s;e treachery of deep, de&s;igning, artful man.</P>
<P>Thus tho&s;e &s;entiments, formerly arranged by mild benignity, taking their hue from the mo&s;t endearing &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, now arming again&s;t each oth|er, produced a chaos in his brea&s;t; where bloomed the &s;weet flowers of complacency, there &s;prung the poi&s;onous weeds of mi&s;tru&s;t and bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit; while tho&s;e rich fervours which nerved the glowing purpo&s;es of benevolence, now mi&s;erably warped by di&s;appointment, heightened the rancour of the mi&s;an|thrope, pointed his implacability, and produced him the determined enemy of his &s;pecies; and thus on the ruins of philanthropy were unfurled the mi&s;anthropic banners; gloomy malevolence rai&s;ed high its ram|parts, and war, inveterate war, was declared again&s;t humanity! His abhorrence of mankind hourly aug|mented; nor did he a&s;&s;ay to &s;truggle with feelings which procured him a tran&s;ient and &s;avage relaxation from inquietude; but &s;tudiou&s;ly cultivating the &s;evere&s;t au&s;terity of di&s;po&s;ition, after procuring a divorce from the perfidious woman who had completed his ruin, he took refuge in the retired rece&s;&s;es of his own apartments, uniformly &s;ecluding him&s;elf from every inquirer.</P>
<P>It was at this period, that, urged by pity, and wi&s;h|ing to point his views to that futurity, which is to di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed humanity truly con&s;olatory, I often pre&s;ented my&s;elf at his door; but although I petitioned in a &s;upplicating tone for entrance, I could never gain ad|mittance; and, tru&s;ting that rea&s;on, when time had ameliorated his deep regrets, would re&s;ume her &s;aluta|ry guidance in his bo&s;om, I forbore to pre&s;s upon his &s;orrows the continuance of a reque&s;t altogether una|vailing, and obviou&s;ly con&s;idered as impertinent.</P>
<P>There were others, however, who, more per&s;evering or more curious, forcibly pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e doors, which
<PB N="105" REF="034162_0771_0FFA667206804A98">
Octavian had determined to bar again&s;t every foot but that of one dome&s;tic, who&s;e &s;ervices the exigencies &s;o intimately inwoven with exi&s;tence rendered ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The unfortunate man received the intrud|ers with inflexible re&s;entment; and, accu&s;ing them of an unwarrantable violation of tho&s;e privileges to which as a citizen he was entitled, he added, that he had looked for &s;ecurity within his own walls, but that he was fearful the globe could furni&s;h no place of refuge again&s;t the inroads of an animal &s;o &s;avage as the human; and &s;ternly in&s;i&s;ting on their immediate de|parture, he affirmed that if they continued their un|welcome mole&s;tations, as he &s;hould be far from oppo|&s;ing him&s;elf to their united &s;trength, he &s;hould be ne|ce&s;&s;itated to commence the life of a wanderer, &s;eeking &s;ome remote cavern, where he might hide him&s;elf from the hated vi&s;age of beings who excited his mo&s;t abhor|rent feelings, and from whom his full &s;oul revolt|ed!! Our gentlemen, aba&s;hed by a rebuff &s;o uncom|mon, and &s;o determined, ha&s;tily retired. But Octa|vian, &s;u&s;pecting that he &s;hould be &s;ubjected to their future encroachments, &s;uddenly withdrew him&s;elf from their knowledge; becoming a voluntary exile from fortune, friends, and all tho&s;e blooming hopes, which, in the gay metropolis where he received a being, had approached him in the mo&s;t fa&s;cinating garb. Imme|diately on his departure, a man of merit, who was his relation, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tates; from which the unhappy and &s;till notoriou&s;ly guilty Me&s;&s;alina receives an annual provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have frequently conver&s;ed with the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;or of tho&s;e e&s;tates; but his &s;ilence to every que&s;tion relative to his kin&s;man, hath been firm and invariable; and I de&s;paired of obtaining further information of the lo&s;t Octavian, until pro&s;ecuting &s;ome weeks &s;ince a journey which I was nece&s;&s;itated to make; in con|&s;equence of an unavoidable detention, I was benighted in the mid&s;t of a road that I had &s;eldom travelled; and a &s;udden and violent &s;hower of rain, adding to the inconvenience of my &s;ituation, I ha&s;tened for
<PB N="106" REF="034162_0772_0FFA669BC6F55770">
&s;helter to a neighbouring wood, where I had not remained many moments, when a remote glimmering attracting my attention, my curio&s;ity was irre&s;i&s;tibly excited; and I determined to follow the clue which the light pre&s;ented: Di&s;mounting, therefore, and &s;ecuring my hor&s;e, I made the be&s;t of my way over the roughe&s;t road I have ever pa&s;&s;ed; when, arriving at a &s;mall cottage, almo&s;t embo&s;omed by a tall growth of trees, I knocked vehemently at the door; and the pelting rain at that moment &s;o &s;trongly enforced the propriety of my demand, that a reluctant entrance was cautiou&s;ly granted: The door was opened by an old man, bent by a weight of years; and the wary he&s;itancy which marked his movements, contributed not a little to augment my &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"<HI>It is a man, Sir,</HI>" in faultering accents, &s;aid he to a grote&s;que figure, who, with folded arms, occupied a corner of the hermitage. "<HI>Well, well,</HI>" returned the Reclu&s;e, in a tone of di&s;plea&s;ure, "<HI>let him continue during the violence of the &s;torm, but when that &s;hall abate he mu&s;t not delay his departure!</HI>" With an addre&s;s the mo&s;t in&s;inuating I could a&s;&s;ume, I approached the fe|rocious ma&s;ter of this my&s;terious cell, who, catching a glance of my countenance, ha&s;tily endeavoured to con|ceal him&s;elf from my ob&s;ervation. The expre&s;&s;ion of angui&s;h which &s;uddenly pervaded his features, was, however, but too evident; and under an a&s;&s;umed ac|rimony, it was obvious that he harboured the mo&s;t corroding glooms! His &s;orrows were contagious; my &s;ympathetic feelings in&s;tantly confe&s;&s;ed their power, and commi&s;eration impelled an e&s;&s;ay to alleviate his misfortunes. Summoning therefore all the rhetoric of which I was ma&s;ter, I proceeded to urge whatever I imagined might a&s;&s;uage the angui&s;h of a mind &s;trug|gling with the ills of life. He heard me with a kind of &s;ullen di&s;dain, when, taking advantage of my fir&s;t pau&s;e, and waving his hand with an emotion of de|&s;pair, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment he replied, "<HI>I know you, Sir&mdash;I know you, Mr. Vigillius,</HI> from my boyi&s;h years I have known you; <HI>you are &s;aid to be a man of

<P>Had Octavian been fully aware of the alteration he had &s;u&s;tained, his &s;ecret might have remained in his own bo&s;om: I &s;hould never have recognized him; that expre&s;&s;ion of divine benevolence, which mantled on his cheek, had given place to a deep and hollow countenance, the hue of which was become pallid and unplea&s;ing; on his &s;mooth and well turned forehead, grief had imprinted her furrowing characters; habit had bent his fine figure, while &s;orrow, anticipating the hand of time, had bleached his head, every hair was white, and his unrazored beard &s;wept venerably on his bo&s;om! If the &s;tranger at fir&s;t &s;ight had &s;trongly intere&s;ted me, the early loved and long lamented Oc|tavian now took full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every faculty of my &s;oul; and, gra&s;ping his hand with a &s;udden exclama|tion of pity and admiration, I pre&s;&s;ed it alternately to my lips and to my bo&s;om.</P>

a&s;&s;ociated with a perfidious woman; but his mind, I ob&s;erved, had been too highly wrought, and his con|fidence in mankind in the aggregate, impo&s;ing on his under&s;tanding, had blinded him to the nece&s;&s;ity of in|ve&s;tigation. I acknowledged that vice, in its mo&s;t odious practices, was but too prevalent; yet I a&s;&s;erted that examples of generous rectitude were frequent in our world; and I held up to his view many in&s;tances, &s;elected from the pre&s;ent day.

<P>The&s;e were the themes on which I largely expatia|ted; but, alas! my efforts effectuated not the de&s;ired purpo&s;e: And, while he affirmed that his hatred and dete&s;tation of his &s;pecies were utterly in&s;urmountable, the <HI>vehemence of his manner enforced a &s;trong conviction of his &s;incerity.</HI> Repeatedly he implored me to leave him; but my per&s;evering &s;olicitude was not ea&s;ily overcome; nor did I quit the cottage, until I obtained what I e&s;teemed a capital conce&s;&s;ion, permi&s;&s;ion to repeat my vi&s;its. And &s;hould I be the fortunate in&s;trument of re&s;toring Octavian to the world, with all tho&s;e &s;ocial feelings with which the omnipotent hand of his Creator endowed him, I &s;hall then po&s;&s;e&s;s at lea&s;t one claim to the gratitude of mankind; and I &s;hall, in &s;uch a pro|pitious event, with hone&s;t exultation, again produce him an object worthy the attention and approbation of the mo&s;t meritorious among my readers.</P>

<Q><L>To all the various grades that mark mankind,</L>
<L>Di&s;criminating manners are a&s;&s;ign'd:</L>
<L><HI>Propriety</HI> erects her decent bounds,</L>
<L>And every &s;en&s;e of real worth &s;urrounds;</L>
<L>She points her land-marks, de&s;ignates her lines,</L>
<L>Con&s;orts with order, and with truth combines;</L>
<L>Each ju&s;t di&s;tinction &s;tudiou&s;ly pre&s;erves,</L>
<L>Nor from her radiant cour&s;e one moment &s;werves.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is, undoubtedly, a beauty and a con&s;i&s;t|ency in uniform propriety, which is beyond the reach of tho&s;e irregular fla&s;hes that are &s;ometimes the production of caprice or chance; and we may as ra|tionally rank the efforts of the Egyptian magicians in the &s;ame cla&s;s with the divine mi&s;&s;ion and heaven &s;anctioned miracles of the I&s;raeliti&s;h law-giver, as com|pare an action, however <HI>beneficial in it&s;elf,</HI> which is merely the re&s;ult of a momentary impul&s;e, to that &s;y&s;tematic virtue that is founded on the arrangements of rea&s;on, confirmed by habit, and matured by expe|rience.</P>
<P>Propriety, &s;aid a friend of mine, is my deity&mdash;and if we mu&s;t commence idolaters, I do not &s;ee that he could have cho&s;en better: Nay, I will go further, and while I am beyond a doubt with re&s;pect to the <HI>only true</HI> object of adoration, I will hazard a que&s;tion whether the <HI>&s;elf-exi&s;ting</HI> Fir&s;t Cau&s;e may not, <HI>in fact,</HI> be wor|&s;hipped under the comprehen&s;ive term <HI>propriety?</HI> It is certain that every thing u&s;eful and becoming mu&s;t proceed from the Author of every good; and, while we render homage to the Parent of the univer&s;e, it may not be e&s;&s;ential whether we hail him as "<HI>Jehovah, Jove, or Lord.</HI>"</P>
<P>I am free to own, that I am wonderfully attached to this &s;ame Propriety; I would care&s;s her as my bo&s;om friend; &s;he &s;hould be an attendant ever on duty; and I would con&s;titute her the in&s;eparable companion
<PB N="110" REF="034162_0776_0FFA68B6086B6540">
and guide of every moment of my exi&s;tence. I have a &s;et of nerves &s;o whim&s;ically con&s;orted, that by a confu&s;ion of characters, unbecoming u&s;urpations, and a gro&s;s departure from the lines evidently de&s;ignated by nature, I am ab&s;olutely unhinged, plunged into a kind of melancholy, and rendered, for the time being, totally unfit for &s;ociety. Indeed every violence done to order, is naturally &s;ucceeded by deformity; and it is undeniably true, that there are no arrangements &s;o perfect, but may be e&s;&s;entially benefited by regularity.</P>
<P>Many an individual has pa&s;&s;ed a laborious exi&s;tence in pur&s;uit of an object he hath never obtained, merely becau&s;e his efforts have been improperly directed. I know a lady, born and educated in one of the &s;outhern S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ates, in which &s;he &s;till continues to re&s;ide, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es talents &s;ufficient to render her re&s;pectable, and in who&s;e bo&s;om a &s;olicitude to plea&s;e has been from in|fancy the ruling pa&s;&s;ion: She is now far advanced in life; &s;he is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of affluence; and &s;he was ear|ly wedded to a gentleman who concedes to her full power to con&s;ult, in every re&s;pect, her own ta&s;te: He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ons and daughters are all advantageou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed of in wedlock; and &s;he devotes her time and fortune to attempts at conciliating e&s;teem; yet it is at this mo|ment altogether problematical, whether this well mean|ing old lady has the good fortune to plea&s;e any indi|vidual except her hu&s;band! How &s;hall we account for a circum&s;tance &s;o adver&s;e? We an&s;wer&mdash;&s;he is not under the domination of propriety. It is evident &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great goodne&s;s of heart; her apartments are the re&s;ort of the rich, the young, and the gay; &s;he is free of acce&s;s to per&s;ons of every de&s;cription, who can form the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ions to decency; her table is elegantly furni&s;hed; and her mu&s;ic, her wine, and her &s;uppers, are the theme of many a tongue. Balls, card-parties, and morning collations&mdash;of the&s;e &s;he is lib|eral; and, as it is her choice to &s;ee company at home, &s;he &s;eldom &s;ubjects her gue&s;ts to the expen&s;e of enter|taining her in return. Her benefactions are numerous; &s;he is ambitious of &s;upplying even <HI>imaginary wants;</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="034162_0777_0FFA68B875384098">
and the ribbons and laces which ornament many of the younger part of her acquaintance, are the pro|duction of her undi&s;tingui&s;hing bounty.</P>
<P>Her life has been unoffending; I never learned that &s;he was in any in&s;tance e&s;&s;entially culpable; and yet I have always heard her mentioned with contempt, and that kind of ridicule which has manife&s;tly evinced that her whole plan of operations has been radically wrong. To in&s;tance&mdash;&s;he mingles with every de&s;crip|tion of gue&s;ts; and, although it is long &s;ince &s;he hath pa&s;&s;ed her grand climacteric, &s;he is &s;till garbed in ha|biliments &s;o fanta&s;tically gaudy, that, was a girl of &s;ixteen thus clad, &s;he would inevitably draw upon her&s;elf the combined cen&s;ures of prudence and of elegance. But it is not enough that &s;he is reprehen|&s;ible in the choice of her apparel; her per&s;on, thus prepo&s;terou&s;ly arrayed, is now &s;eated at the card-table, and now placed at the head of the dancing party, grouped with girls and boys, who, while they &s;oothe her by the mo&s;t flattering encomiums, impatiently wait the opportunity of turning her into deri&s;ion; &s;he <HI>walks down the ranks;</HI> and, having unfortunately <HI>no ear for mu&s;ic,</HI> &s;he is commonly out of time and place; and, in the &s;ame moment that &s;he is thus ridiculous, &s;he fancies her&s;elf the object of univer&s;al admiration!</P>
<P>Poor deluded lady, &s;hould thy eye ever glance over this page, let not its &s;incerity offend; tru&s;t me it is penned by one who is &s;uitably impre&s;&s;ed by a due re|&s;pect for thy virtues, and who has repeatedly combated in thy behalf. It is beyond a doubt, that thy &s;olicitude to plea&s;e is not only ju&s;tifiable, but laudable; and the prime error in thy arrangements, hath been the ne|glecting to engage that <HI>propriety</HI> which is a guide every way adequate to the conducting us through the mo&s;t intricate paths. That thou ha&s;t mi&s;&s;ed thy goal, cir|cum&s;tanced as thou art, cannot be matter of wonder: We regret thy di&s;appointment, and as we are in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch documents concerning thee, as convince us that thy ruling pa&s;&s;ion is &s;till &s;trongly operative in thy bo&s;om, we are happy that it is not yet too late to
<PB N="112" REF="034162_0778_0FFA68C590EEBF50">
&s;ketch for thee a plan, which, if adopted, will infalli|bly inve&s;t thee with that de&s;ideratum at which thou ha&s;t &s;o long ineffectually aimed.</P>
<P>We will be careful to abridge thy plea&s;ures as little as po&s;&s;ible; and, as &s;ociety may be requi&s;ite to cheer the winter of age, we will agree that thy exten&s;ive ac|quaintance &s;hall be the coevals of thy convenience. Of parties of plea&s;ure, under the direction of amity and corrected hilarity, we decidedly approve. Mu&s;ic has been &s;tyled intellectual food; and dancing combines the advantages of exerci&s;e, with convivial enjoyment. But, although we unhe&s;itatingly allow thy frequent a&s;|&s;emblies, we cannot admire thy <HI>individual wanderings;</HI> thy &s;miles and thy pre&s;ence may &s;anction youthful glee, while no <HI>antique movements ab&s;urdly point the ven|erable appearance thou ha&s;t received from the hand of im|pre&s;&s;ive time.</HI> Do&s;t thou want exerci&s;e, thy convenient carriages wait but thy command to waft thee to the charming rece&s;&s;es of the village groves; and all the rural plea&s;ures of which the peaceful hamlet is produc|tive, are at thy command. A celebrated writer in|forms us that the poli&s;hed &s;ons and daughters of France always refu&s;e to mingle in the dance, after they have pa&s;&s;ed the age of thirty. <HI>French etiquette</HI> has long been di&s;tingui&s;hed and ob&s;erved; and I am free to own, that I admire the <HI>propriety</HI> of this re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>There is, unque&s;tionably, a period when the man|ners of the human being ought to a&s;&s;ume a dignity of character, when they cannot con&s;i&s;tently nor graceful|ly de&s;cend to frivolity; and we &s;hould be careful that we do not forfeit that re&s;pectability, which is the pre|rogative of years. Ob&s;erve the time-honoured matron who hath enli&s;ted under the banners of <HI>propriety;</HI> her brow is not contracted by &s;everity&mdash;&s;he pre&s;ides in the circles of gaiety, without ca&s;ting a cloud on their en|joyments&mdash;&s;he mingles in the parties of the youthful candidates for plea&s;ure; and tho&s;e remarks which &s;he is occa&s;ionally induced to make, drawn from the trea&s;|ury of wi&s;dom, are calculated both to delight and in|form.
<PB N="113" REF="034162_0779_0FFC5813AE36DB38">
Her &s;entiments are the growth of a good un|der&s;tanding, enriched by experience, and they are pointed by candour; &s;he is regarded as a model, and beloved as a friend; her language is never adulatory; and yet &s;he ha&s;tens to render that ju&s;t tribute of prai&s;e which &s;hould be con&s;idered as the unalienable reward of merit. When &s;he is under the nece&s;&s;ity of pointing out a fault, the per&s;ua&s;ive energy and conviction of her remarks, combine that kind of mildne&s;s, which is always &s;ure to &s;oothe, while they effectuate the reform|ation they are de&s;igned to procure; her looks, her movements, her every arrangement, is de&s;criptive of <HI>propriety;</HI> conde&s;cending dignity is in&s;cribed on the features of her finely expre&s;&s;ive countenance, and all who behold her are con&s;trained to admire and to ven|erate the truly <HI>con&s;i&s;tent matron.</HI> By the benedictions of the young people of both &s;exes, &s;he is con&s;tantly followed&mdash;they court her &s;ociety with avidity, and re|tire from her pre&s;ence cheerful, grateful, and compar|atively happy. In her gratuities &s;he judiciou&s;ly <HI>di&s;|criminates,</HI> and &s;he uniformly prefers aiding the efforts of the de&s;erving orphan, who, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her needle, is &s;truggling to obtain a decent &s;upport, to the plea&s;ure of adding a few yards of lace to the ornaments of her greate&s;t favourites. Once I knew &s;uch a female; but alas! &s;he is now no more&mdash;the big &s;tream of una|vailing &s;orrow marked her exit; the virtues clad in &s;ables joined the funereal proce&s;&s;ion; <HI>propriety</HI> mourned the decea&s;e of the mo&s;t unoffending of her votaries, while the regrets of all ranks of people were produc|tive of a general lamentation. Sweet is the recollection of her life; and her memory, embalmed by her worth, will endure until the powers of retention &s;hall be con|&s;igned to oblivion.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e in who&s;e bo&s;oms a de&s;ire to plea&s;e irre&s;i&s;ti|bly predominates, gave them&s;elves time to reflect&mdash;if they would e&s;tabli&s;h the regency of <HI>propriety,</HI> conviction would unavoidably follow, and they would then know that a regular and per&s;evering conformity to her dic|tates,
<PB N="114" REF="034162_0780_0FFC5810C4CE6C48">
is the only career, the unclouded &s;plendor of which can effectually &s;ilence the clamours of rancour and the hootings of envy. The confounding different periods of time and de&s;troying tho&s;e di&s;criminating marks which are calculated to de&s;ignate characters, mu&s;t always di&s;gu&s;t; the man who would mount the breach, cloathed in canonicals, would be alike prepo&s;|terous with him who &s;hould a&s;cend the pulpit, arrayed in a &s;uit of full trimed regimentals! and the giggling Mi&s;s who has ju&s;t completed her tenth year, habited in the gravely fancied garb, de&s;igned to enrobe the decent limbs of the venerable matron, is not more ridiculous than the woman of &s;ixty, who&s;e ill cho&s;en ornaments an|&s;wer no other purpo&s;e than to render her an object of deri&s;ion! The truth is, &s;he thus excites attention to the years &s;he hath numbered, forcibly pointing her longev|ity by the very method &s;he hath taken to conceal it! her gay apparel &s;eems to multiply the furrows on her face, every unbecoming article apparently deepens her wrinkles, and renders &s;till more hollow the hollow of her cheeks.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom has judiciou&s;ly affixed to the various ranks in &s;ociety its a&s;certaining marks, and we cannot &s;ee her barriers thrown down, or the ru&s;hing together of the different cla&s;&s;es of mankind, without regret. Had I been born a female, it is very po&s;&s;ible I might have con|ducted as females do; but however this might have been, I think I could not have denied that the fanta&s;|tical trappings of dre&s;s are <HI>always</HI> indicative of a frivo|lous mind. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that plainne&s;s of ap|parel is much more de&s;criptive of dignity of character than embroidered ve&s;tments, furbelowed robes, or full dre&s;&s;ed caps. Singularity of dre&s;s is a peculiar trait in the principles of quakeri&s;m, and the garb of this &s;ect is calculated to give a rational impre&s;&s;ion of their tenets. The plain quaker-coloured &s;attin, neatly &s;ewed togeth|er, the milk white mu&s;lin or lawn, fa&s;hioned into the becoming handkerchief and well &s;et colf&mdash;in &s;hort, the <HI>tout en&s;emble</HI> of the mode&s;t quaker's attire hath gene|rally
<PB N="115" REF="034162_0781_0FFC580D77542B58">
extorted the mo&s;t unequivocal te&s;timonies of ap|probation. A maiden thus clad prefers at fir&s;t &s;ight her claim to our e&s;teem&mdash;we are not impelled to an ap|preciation of the value of that time &s;he hath murdered at her toilette&mdash;we have no u&s;ele&s;s appendages to calcu|late, and we indulge a plea&s;ing hope that &s;he has devot|ed her hours to the cultivation of her under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I do not recollect ever to have heard a &s;ingle gentle|man expre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments on dre&s;s, who has not been deci&s;ive in his preference of the quaker habit. I know &s;ome men who are mute on almo&s;t every other &s;ubject, who, whenever this is introduced on the tapis, are even eloquent in the avowal of their admiration&mdash;and ladies of the be&s;t under&s;tanding have regularly giv|en their voices on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion. How then does it happen that every de&s;cription of women among us, quakers excepted, are ambitious of exhibit|ing as much of &s;how in their apparel, and of making as glittering an appearance as their ideas of the rules impo&s;ed by elegance and propriety will admit? This is an enigma re&s;erved for THE SEX to explain; and in the mean time it may be pre&s;umed, that when the pe|riod arrives which &s;hall render it <HI>fa&s;hionable</HI> to accu&s;tom females to an early attention to <HI>u&s;eful &s;tudies,</HI> which &s;hall teach them to rea&s;on, inve&s;tigate, and compare, and to invigorate their under&s;tandings by a compre|hen&s;ion, and a con&s;equent adoption of tho&s;e arguments which re&s;ult from &s;ound &s;en&s;e, and are recognized by truth&mdash;when, I &s;ay, in the hi&s;tory of human nature, this period &s;hall have di&s;placed the admini&s;tration of frivolity, I will pledge my reputation that their dre&s;s will become an object of le&s;s importance, that it will be remarkable for its &s;implicity, and that every ab|&s;urdity will be bani&s;hed from the toilette.</P>

<P>It is not more &s;trange than true, Emily.

<P>The gratitude of my mother was un|bounded; mine al&s;o was powerfully engaged&mdash;for a time it deceived me: Camden declared him&s;elf my lover; but although I have long &s;ince under&s;tood the &s;ituation of my own heart, I am not permitted to deal explicitly with Major Camden.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand you, Harriot. I engaged in a round of di&s;&s;ipation&mdash;I continued the mo&s;t cen|&s;urable pur&s;uits; and at length <HI>imagined</HI> my&s;elf ten|derly attached to a per&s;on, who was every way the <HI>inferior of</HI> your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your father continued his forbearance, until convinced, by circum&s;tances, that he had a rival in my affections! when, leaving me at our country &s;eat, without a &s;ingle remon&s;trance, and taking with him your brother, then only four years old, he depart|ed for this city, leading me to expect he would return with the coming day! <STAGE>[weeps.]</STAGE></P>

<P>Dear Madam, proceed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were then but two months old: The fir&s;t po&s;t brought me a letter, in which he inform|ed me, that, as he was convinced I was unalterably attached to another, he &s;hould bid me an eternal

adieu!&mdash;that he took with him our &s;on, as the only &s;olace of his exile&mdash;that he left me the uninterrupted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his town and country hou&s;e, with a &s;uffi|cient income to &s;upport my&s;elf and daughter&mdash;and he concluded by wi&s;hing me, with the man of my heart, all that felicity on which he &s;uppo&s;ed my fond imagi|nation had calculated.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came immediately to town; but he had embarked on board a &s;hip, bound to &s;ome part of Europe! From &s;ea&s;on to &s;ea&s;on, for a long time, I encouraged hope; but, although nineteen years have &s;ince revolved, not a &s;ingle &s;yllable, either re&s;pecting him&s;elf or my &s;on, hath ever ble&s;t my ears!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ob&s;erve me, girl; although I was indi&s;|creet, I was never criminal; and the moment of your father's departure convinced me of my error&mdash;<HI>the charm was broke</HI>&mdash;<HI>I dete&s;ted the author of my &s;ufferings</HI>&mdash;<HI>I never after &s;aw him;</HI> and, to my great &s;atisfaction, I learned that he immediately quitted the continent.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE pa&s;&s;ed one of tho&s;e days, that, on &s;ober reflection, I would gladly reiterate. The morning ro&s;e delightfully &s;erene; and, having offered at the &s;hrine of Deity our early ori&s;ons, I propo&s;ed to Mary a vi&s;it to our children; an enchanting little jaunt produced us at Hamilton Place. Edward met us with cu&s;tomary expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s, and Marga|retta with tho&s;e demon&s;trations of affection that have ever marked her conduct. We pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome delightful moments amid the captivating endearments of the little William and his &s;i&s;ters, and their &s;ociety operated as the &s;weete&s;t &s;olace to our minds. On the entrance of le&s;s intere&s;ted friends, we were, however, con&s;trained to di&s;mi&s;s the lovely prattlers; and, be&s;towing on them the benediction of affection, we committed them to the care of a faithful woman, to whom Margaretta, when <HI>unavoidably engaged,</HI> is in the habit of entru&s;ting them.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="034162_0830_0FFC576FDDD2CFB8">
The commencement of the conver&s;ation, after the children had retired, took a turn extremely adver&s;e to my wi&s;hes&mdash;<HI>Briti&s;h enormities,</HI> and <HI>Briti&s;h ingratitude</HI> was the theme; and I, who &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;hrink from in&s;tances of <HI>human depravity,</HI> naturally turned with di&s;gu&s;t from the &s;ubject. It is true I am a Gleaner; but, I am, neverthele&s;s, at a world of pains to winnow my multifarious collections; and I mu&s;t be fully con|vinced of their utility, before I can con&s;ent that the bitter ingredients &s;hould obtain the a&s;cendency even in a &s;ingle e&s;&s;ay. Fortunately for me, the cour&s;e of tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, which were i&s;&s;uing with a &s;ufficient quantum of acrimony, was unexpectedly arre&s;ted, and conducted into an oppo&s;ite channel, by the interference of a young gentleman, a Captain L&mdash;, whom I have long regarded with no &s;mall complacency: The &s;eeds of every virtue are implanted in his brea&s;t; but conceiving an aver&s;ion from the <HI>o&s;tentious parade</HI> of excellence, he hath, I have imagined, embraced a contrary extreme; and his fine qualities, are, con&s;e|quently, veiled by appearances, which the &s;uperficial regard as expre&s;&s;ive of propen&s;ities directly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e that are paramount in his bo&s;om. Young as he is, he &s;eems preci&s;ely to have e&s;timated the value of the human character; the man of <HI>real virtue</HI> will ever find him warmly attached to his intere&s;t; and he is &s;incerely beloved by every one to whom he is <HI>fully known.</HI> All the energies of his &s;oul have to-day been called into action; and his fine eyes, &s;parkling with even more than their wonted lu&s;tre, while he plead the cau&s;e of truth, evinced the <HI>kindred virtues</HI> which are inherent in his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>He introduced his te&s;timony by ob&s;erving it was very probable the Britons might, in many in&s;tances, have been offenders, but that his own experience was an exception to clamours, which he imagined were far too general; and he proceeded to inform us, that, having taken the command of a &s;hip, he had cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic with all the prejudices of an American; that, with the pride of a young man enthu&s;ia&s;tically
<PB N="165" REF="034162_0831_0FFC576E3A64E5F8">
devoted to his country, he had anchored in the river Thames; that he went on &s;hore prepared to repel in&s;ults, and with a high &s;en&s;e of the haughtine&s;s and ingratitude of the Engli&s;h nation. Circum&s;tances, however, &s;oon produced a plea&s;ing revolution in his mind; the di&s;po&s;al of a large and various cargo, in|troduced him to different de&s;criptions of people, all of whom he found ea&s;y of acce&s;s, and fair and open in their dealings. The knowledge that he was an American, &s;eemed to augment his con&s;equence; and every one appearing eager to &s;erve him, he was led to wonder whither the arrogance and re&s;erve attrib|uted to tho&s;e I&s;landers had vani&s;hed. Retiring to his &s;hip, he was indulging a reverie on this &s;ubject, when an unknown voice, ob&s;erving to one of the &s;hip-mates, who was lighting him into the great cabin, that he had but recently heard the name of the commander, arre&s;ted his attention; he had &s;carce time to form a conjecture, ere the &s;tranger pre&s;ented him&s;elf before him.</P>
<P>"Your name, Sir, I am informed, is L&mdash;; but information is &s;uperfluous; your features have taken too great hold on my mind ever to be era&s;ed there|from."&mdash;The &s;tranger advanced with open arms&mdash;The American &s;tood collected&mdash;"You have the ad|vantage of me, Sir; I have not the plea&s;ure of know|ing you."&mdash;"Probably not, Sir; and yet I have often cla&s;ped you to my bo&s;om; you u&s;ed to be ambitious of a place on my knee; and your innocent remarks have amu&s;ed me, during &s;ome very gloomy hours. My name is P&mdash;. I was captured by Captain N&mdash;, commander of the &s;hip S&mdash;&punc; a man, <HI>in who&s;e bo&s;om true nobility &s;eemed inherent.</HI> I have &s;aid a thou|&s;and times, that his &s;pirit was too big for his body; and when, after my return home, I put to &s;ea again, one of my leading motives for wi&s;hing to make a prize of Captain N&mdash;, was, that I might be furni&s;hed with an opportunity of emulating his acts of genero&s;ity. But in your father's hou&s;e, Sir, I found even a pater|nal home. God ble&s;s the honoured man&mdash;Does he
<PB N="166" REF="034162_0832_0FFC57696BC9F9E8">
&s;till live? If he does, the wandering &s;ufferer may yet obtain a friend and father, who is not only an honour to the American name, but to humanity at large."</P>
<P>Captain L&mdash;, it will not be doubted, received a man &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the virtues of his father, and on who&s;e bo&s;om the <HI>laws of gratitude</HI> &s;eemed im|printed, with the requi&s;ite attention. The grateful Briton would have conducted him immediately to his hou&s;e; he entreated him to take up his quarters there; and, although pained by a refu&s;al, his frequent invita|tions, while he continued on the river, hardly left him an unappropriated day. Captain P&mdash;quitting his employ on the ocean, had entered into a line of bu&s;ine&s;s which empowered him to &s;upply the naviga|tor with many articles of which he was in want; and the American commander, with a view of giving him the preference, made continual application to his warehou&s;e: But occupied, previous to his departure, in clo&s;ing his accounts, he commi&s;&s;ioned the per&s;on whom he had employed to di&s;charge the debts he had contracted, to wait on his ho&s;pitable friend for his bill; when, to his great a&s;toni&s;hment, he was informed that he had no pecuniary demands upon him. He imme|diately ha&s;tened to the compting-hou&s;e of the merchant.&mdash;"What can you mean, Sir, by the me&s;&s;age I have ju&s;t received? Am I not indebted to you for articles to a con&s;iderable amount?"</P>
<P>"No, indeed, Sir," returned the <HI>&s;ea di&s;ciplined veteran,</HI> while an hone&s;t tear glittered in his eye&mdash;"<HI>Your father has rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for you to become my debtor!!</HI> I wi&s;h to God the articles to which you refer, were of greater value. Commend me to the good man to whom you are returning; and if you are not di&s;po&s;ed to affront a brother Sailor, you will mention this affair no more." This was &s;ufficient; our young gentleman was nece&s;&s;itated to <HI>defer the day of retribution.</HI> They drank together a parting bottle; and he hoi&s;ted &s;ail with far other ideas of Engli&s;h men and manners than tho&s;e with which he had ca&s;t anchor.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="034162_0833_0FFC5767E96ADC08">
While Captain L&mdash;was concluding his recital, we were joined by Seymour and his Serafina, who had recently returned from an excur&s;ion into the State of Vermont; and they related a little narrative alto|gether in point; for the <HI>authenticity of which the Gleaner pledges his veracity.</HI></P>
<P>Captain A&mdash;, a Briti&s;h officer of family and for|tune, was one of the many brave men, who, induced by a &s;en&s;e of duty to their &s;overeign, or erroneous ideas of the cau&s;e in which they engaged, armed and embodied them&s;elves for the purpo&s;e of exterminating from this new world all oppo&s;ition to the mandates of a government, u&s;urping an unwarrantable &s;overeignty, and peremptorily in&s;i&s;ting on the power of binding, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, a people &s;eparated from them by the broad Atlantic, and who had never been repre|&s;ented in their national or legally con&s;tituted a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Captain A&mdash;&s;hared the fate of many of his a&s;&s;ociates in the war; and after a number of marches and counter-marches, he was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;urrendering to tho&s;e undi&s;ciplined men, whom he had hardly deigned to con&s;ider as &s;oldiers. He was committed to the care of a Major B&mdash;, then &s;tation|ed in a metropolis, well known in the commercial world; this officer, from the dawn of the revolution, had glowed with a holy zeal in his country's cau&s;e; he was foremo&s;t in tho&s;e ranks who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in defence of that liberty, for which &s;uch countle&s;s heroes fought and bled; and in addition to the rank of Major, he was inve&s;ted with that of Com|mi&s;&s;ary of Pri&s;oners. Captain A&mdash;received every indulgence of which his &s;ituation was &s;u&s;ceptible; the Commi&s;&s;ary knew how to appreciate his virtues, nor was any effort left una&s;&s;ayed, which it was imagined might render his captivity ea&s;y. Love, all potent love, &s;econded the&s;e benign arrangements, and the brave, the humane &s;oldier was in every view a con|quered man; but he was received by the lovely &s;ubdu|er of his heart with enchanting lenity; honour was regent in her bo&s;om, frankne&s;s dwelt on her lips, and
<PB N="168" REF="034162_0834_0FFC576173A3B618">
&s;he intuitively felt that &s;he might confide. The pa|rental &s;anction awarded her election; the holy prie&s;t received their vows; and to a heart &s;o faithfully de|voted, the bonds of captivity became indeed &s;ilken.</P>
<P>Thus ble&s;t by friend&s;hip and by love, it cannot be matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, that a &s;trong predilection in favour of America triumphed in his bo&s;om; nor that he was with the foremo&s;t in offering up his ardent vows for the &s;ucce&s;s of her battling chiefs. It is true, when the final adju&s;tment of the preliminaries of peace left the pri&s;oner at liberty to return to his na|tive country, that, accompanied by his Honora, he departed with the re&s;t; but he departed with a de|termined re&s;olution to return as &s;oon as the po&s;ture of his affairs would permit; and on his arrival in Eng|land, he was &s;o indefatigable in procuring tho&s;e ar|rangements, which were nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ale both of his patrimonial and acquired e&s;tates, that he very &s;peedily re-embarked for this new world. His voyage was pro&s;perous, and he arrived here, flu&s;hed with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing expectations.</P>
<P>Di&s;patch nece&s;&s;arily attends the tran&s;actions of an active and an ardent mind, and but a &s;hort period elap&s;ed, ere he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of a large tract of mo&s;t excellent land in the Gene&s;&s;ee country, where, taking his &s;tand, he conceived the laudable re&s;olution of col|lecting round him as many indu&s;trious, well di&s;po&s;ed and &s;ober citizens, as &s;hould feel a freedom to embrace plans, which combined as their object, not only his own emolument, but the advancement of the country of his adoption, and of all tho&s;e individuals who might be di&s;po&s;ed to adopt his views. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to conceive of a &s;ituation more plea&s;ingly elevated than that of be&s;towing protection, with the means of competency, and ob&s;erving in return the &s;pontaneous fruits of gratitude. Yet Captain A&mdash;was but half ble&s;t; for his mo&s;t diligent re&s;earches could di&s;cover no ve&s;tige of the friend, who in the night of adver&s;ity had illumined, by his beneficent interpo&s;ition, the thick darkne&s;s by which he was &s;urrounded.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="034162_0835_0FFC575FD944AC78">
Major B&mdash;, from the era which di&s;banded the American army, had been involved in a &s;eries of mis|fortunes! Generous, perhaps to an extreme, and emi|nently humane, the nece&s;&s;ities of his dependents were, <HI>in effect</HI> his own; he was wedded to a woman, lovely in her per&s;on, and &s;uperior in her mind; his infant train, even in the e&s;timation of a di&s;intere&s;ted ob&s;erver, were highly promi&s;ing, and the care of an ancient and widowed mother devolved &s;olely on him. No pecu|niary reward awaited his &s;ervices; his pay had never exceeded his expenditures; and the clo&s;e of the war con&s;igned him to penury.</P>
<P>Would that his fate exhibited a &s;olitary in&s;tance! Oh, America, America! where is the harve&s;t which thou ha&s;t trea&s;ured for thy war-worn chiefs? Is pov|erty the wreath which thou re&s;erve&s;t for the brow of thy &s;oldiers? When will my country be fully exon|erated from the charge of ingratitude? When will &s;he a&s;&s;ign to deeds of worth a &s;uitable and adequate compen&s;ation?</P>
<P>Major B&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an undaunted &s;pirit, and, with a view of warding off the impending evil, he had tak|en up &s;ums of money, expecting that, by &s;ome propi|tious adventure, he &s;hould be able to extricate him&s;elf from his embarra&s;&s;ments. Hope was warm in his bo&s;om, and he was &s;anguine enough to imagine he &s;hould be able to di&s;charge the la&s;t farthing of his arrearages; but all his enterpri&s;es failed; the waves of misfortune &s;wiftly &s;ucceeded each other; an arre&s;t terminated his career, and he was immured within the comfortle&s;s walls of a pri&s;on.

Reflection, however, at length produced a melan|choly calm; the &s;torm of the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ided; and, re&s;olving to retire far from the knowledge of tho&s;e with whom he had once a&s;&s;ociated, he took &s;helter on the extreme verge of a newly located town&s;hip, in the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, bordering on that of Vermont. Here, de&s;poiled of every other re&s;ource, and &s;inking under a weight of calamity, his health impaired and his &s;pirits broken, the brave, the benevolent officer, with a wife who would have added new lu&s;tre to a diadem, with a lovely and intere&s;ting family of children, and an aged mother&mdash;here, in this de&s;olate &s;pot, renting a &s;mall hou&s;e on the country road, and putting up a bill for entertainment, he depended for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on the nece&s;&s;ities and caprices of the pa&s;&s;ing traveller; while the &s;canty pittance he thus obtained, was attend|ed with &s;uch a variety of humiliating circum&s;tances, as to render the burden of life almo&s;t in&s;upportable!</P>
<P>It was on a fine evening in June, ju&s;t as the parting rays of the &s;un had darted his &s;etting beams on the we&s;t|ern mountains, that this meritorious &s;ufferer indulged his corroding melancholy at the door of his cottage. Sorrow had well nigh obliterated from his memory all traces of Captain A&mdash;, and he remained in entire ig|norance of his return to America. A &s;uperb phaeton appeared in the road, and, con&s;cious of his &s;ituation, he &s;huddered at its approach. It &s;topped&mdash;a &s;ervant alighted, and a gentleman and lady i&s;&s;ued from the carriage. Nothing of this kind had ever before made its appearance in that place, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> its vicinity, and the &s;pirit of the care-worn &s;oldier almo&s;t died within him. He &s;urveyed his gue&s;ts; and as he reverted to the in&s;uf|ficiency of that provi&s;ion which it was within his abil|ity to make, the angui&s;h of his mind was more than proportioned to the occa&s;ion. It was too late, however, for the travellers to proceed farther that night; no other public hou&s;e was within many miles; and with an air of ineffable benignity, the gentleman handed the lady in|to the cottage; but hardly had he pa&s;&s;ed the thre&s;h|old, when, glancing the highly honoured Veteran, in a

voice of extacy, inmingled with a&s;toni&s;hment, he ex|claimed:</P>
<P>"<HI>Great and good God! who do I &s;ee?</HI>&mdash;Major B&mdash;, is it po&s;&s;ible, or do the vi&s;ions of the night once more mock my wi&s;hes? Tell me, are you indeed my incom|parable friend?" He ha&s;tened forward&mdash;in a moment they were locked in each others arms; the unfortu|nate man almo&s;t ga&s;ped for breath; to re&s;pond was not immediately in his power. At length, however, he articulated&mdash;"<HI>Yes, yes, I am indeed your once happy&mdash;now de&s;olate friend. My pro&s;pects</HI>&mdash;<HI>where are they? Fled</HI>&mdash;<HI>gone forever.</HI>" "Cloud not," interrupted Captain A&mdash;, (for the feelings of the reader have doubtle&s;s already recognized the grateful Briton) "could not, I charge you, the happine&s;s of this unexpected meeting, by unavailing reflection; but, embracing henceforward the &s;ame hopes and fears, let us, on this memorable evening, reciprocate vows of eternal amity, and let us mutually con&s;ent to put it beyond the power of fate again to &s;eparate us."</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ions of Mrs. B&mdash;and Mrs. A&mdash;were even more impa&s;&s;ioned than tho&s;e of the gentle|men; they had been attached in early life&mdash;and the night was &s;pent in mutual congratulation, mutual re|citals, and reiterated profe&s;&s;ions of undimini&s;hed and unalterable regards, while the travellers failed not re|peatedly to ble&s;s that curio&s;ity, which, leading them to make the tour of the ea&s;tern States, had thus be&s;tow|ed on them the objects whom they had &s;o long una|vailingly pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>To penury, and all its gloomy attendants, Major B&mdash;has now bid adieu. Captain A&mdash;pre&s;ented him with a deed of gift, conveying to him, and his heirs for ever, as a patrimonial inheritance, one thou|&s;and acres of the be&s;t of his land. Two thou&s;and more are his, at half the price for which they are &s;old to original purcha&s;ers; and he is to di&s;po&s;e of the&s;e to the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible advantage.

with &s;ufficient &s;ums to remove his family; a commo|dious habitation is erected for him on his own grounds; again he ba&s;ks in the full meridian of &s;ociety and of friend&s;hip, and the &s;un of pro&s;perity gilds the evening of his days. The &s;en&s;ations of his &s;oul are frequently too big for utterance; he gazes on his matchle&s;s bene|factor, and the tear gu&s;hes in his eye; ardent affection, and grateful admiration are impre&s;&s;ed on his manly features, while ge&s;tures, abundantly more expre&s;&s;ive than the mo&s;t emphatic language, pourtray the ener|gies of his &s;oul.</P>

<P>YES, it is po&s;&s;ible, there may perhaps have been individuals, who, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the word, have merited the appellation, <HI>Citizens of the World</HI>&mdash;who&s;e &s;trong minds, &s;truggling &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t every view which hath not received a general contour, and pro&s;trating at the &s;hrine of human na|ture, in the aggregate, have conducted as if the va&s;t globe was their country, the venerable pair o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Eden their immediate parents, and every wide-&s;preading col|lateral branch of the family of man, alike entitled to their good offices.</P>
<P>Yet, I take leave to a&s;k the reflecting and intelligent reader, if this divine expan&s;ion is not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, the property of Deity? and whether tho&s;e who affect his attributes are not guilty of arrogant a&s;&s;umption? Man is a limited being; his movements are circum|&s;cribed

within narrow bounds; his eye can take in, at a &s;ingle view, but a &s;mall portion of our world: If he would tran&s;port him&s;elf from place to place, his progre&s;s, impeded by a variety of incumbrances, mu&s;t be gradual; and if he would traver&s;e the globe, he mu&s;t devote to the arduous enterprize the revolution of many &s;ucceeding months. Every individual is nec|e&s;&s;arily de&s;cended from a particular family; nature implants her attachments, and the hand of violence can alone uproot them.</P>
<P>The Deity views, at a &s;ingle glance, the univer&s;e out&s;pread before him&mdash;he is not confined to time, or place: Every created being is the offspring of his commanding <HI>fiat;</HI> and the unbounded diffu&s;ion of his copious and impartial regards, is therefore an effect nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from a great and Omnipotent Cau&s;e. When we are di&s;encumbered from the&s;e ma|terial machines, and move with the velocity of &s;pirit, the probability is, that we &s;hall partake more e&s;&s;en|tially the properties of our Divine Original. But dif|ferent di&s;pen&s;ations authorize a varied economy; and the difficulty (and, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, the im|po&s;&s;ibility) of &s;urmounting inherent and local attach|ments, may, perhaps, like every other prominent fea|ture of nature, be attended with its coeval advantages.</P>
<P>"I cannot, for my &s;oul," &s;aid Albinus, as arm un|der arm he cro&s;&s;ed State-&s;treet with Degeneus&mdash;"I cannot, for my &s;oul, obliterate my local partialities. Born in London, the name of an Engli&s;hman operates as a kind of charm; I involuntarily yield him a moi|ety of my affection; and I am better plea&s;ed to meet a good character from that country, than from any other part of the globe." I would advi&s;e Albinus not to attempt the extermination of his local partiali|ties: In other words, I would advi&s;e him not to en|ter the li&s;ts as a combatant again&s;t <HI>parent Nature.</HI> Hath not the preferable love of country, hath not fam|ily attachments their advantages?

to the intere&s;ts of our country? It is certainly laudable to cultivate and invigorate a &s;pirit of <HI>general philanthropy;</HI> but &s;till, is it not according to the cour&s;e of things, that the ardent glow &s;hould embrace "<HI>friends, parents, neighbours, fir&s;t?</HI>" until, in a regular progre&s;&s;ion, circles thus formed &s;ucceed each other, while nature views complacent, the order and gradual advances of her children.&mdash;Let us pau&s;e to inve&s;ti|gate for a moment.</P>
<P>The fact advanced is, I pre&s;ume, &s;elf-evident; and I conceive its utility is as clearly demon&s;trable. The approbation of tho&s;e with whom we are connected, frequently furni&s;hes the mo&s;t powerful incentive to virtue. Every local preference produces a motive to proper and becoming actions; they continually ope|rate as &s;o many mentors, &s;ugge&s;ting and nerving the purpo&s;es of virtue. Shall I wound the tender bo&s;om of her to whom I am indebted for my exi&s;tence? Shall I transfix the paternal feelings of that white-headed man, who, from my fir&s;t dawn of being, has watched over me for good? Shall I outrage the manly tender|ne&s;s which my brothers have cultivated toward me? Shall I call a blu&s;h into the cheek of my &s;i&s;ters? Shall I do violence to the confidence of friend&s;hip, or cover with confu&s;ion the countenance of my fellow-citizens? The&s;e are con&s;iderations which &s;ometimes operate on the man, keeping him &s;teady to the ar|rangements of rectitude, even when the agency of the vicegerent in his brea&s;t is &s;u&s;pended, or becomes inef|fectual in its admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Are we removed from that &s;pot of earth, where fir&s;t the purple &s;tream commenced its vital flow? the re|port which echoing fame will waft to tho&s;e dear na|tive haunts, becomes, in our e&s;timation, an object of the greate&s;t magnitude. What ideas will the narra|tion of &s;uch and &s;uch an action originate? How will my connexions, who &s;till continue there, be affected by &s;uch a particular &s;tep? and what will they think of my conduct, on any occa&s;ion, on which all the ener|gies of my &s;oul may have been called into exerci&s;e?
<PB N="175" REF="034162_0841_0FFC574CCF1E2DA0">
Thus I am induced to think, that a venerating attach|ment to the opinions, and a &s;olicitude for the approba|tion, of tho&s;e with whom we were early in the habits of amity, have a tendency to originate and confirm a regular &s;y&s;tem of propriety, to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;crupulous accuracy of conduct, and frequently to operate as the tali&s;man of every laudable exertion. I am not a friend to the <HI>de&s;poti&s;m</HI> of prejudice; I would di&s;countenance <HI>undue</HI> partialities; and I contend only for the utility of <HI>prominent</HI> and <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing,</HI> not <HI>exclu&s;ive,</HI> regards. He, who&s;e range is the univer&s;e, will, too, probably, become al&s;o an itinerant in virtue; or at lea&s;t, the di&s;&s;ipation of his views may gradually con&s;ign his merit to oblivion. I do not a&s;&s;ert, that my ideas may not be erroneous; I pretend not to fill the chair of infallibility; but it is, perhaps, well to put the be&s;t face on a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> which &s;eems compri&s;ed in the very complexure of our nature.</P>
<P>Local attachments, we have &s;aid, (and we believe, with a few exceptions, it will be found true) in&s;inuate them&s;elves into, and become interwoven with, the very fibres of our exi&s;tence; and their invincibility, when it is remembered that we are under the direction of un|erring Wi&s;dom, is a commanding proof of their util|ity. Much time hath elap&s;ed &s;ince I bid adieu to my native place; but neither years nor di&s;tance can ob|literate the &s;en&s;ations which clu&s;ter round reflection, as I contemplate that, <HI>to me,</HI> intere&s;ting &s;pot. It was the &s;cene of my early plea&s;ures; and the recollection of its dear dome&s;tic haunts are right precious to my &s;oul. There, too, were pa&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t agonizing mo|ments I have ever yet endured. The authors of my being have long &s;ince &s;lept in the du&s;t; but their a&s;hes hallow that earth, which will ever be entitled to, and which will &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s, my veneration. Misfortunes elouded my youth&mdash;my path was marked by &s;orrow. Many painful events have con&s;pired to throw a gloom over the place of my birth&mdash;I would not return to it&mdash;I would not again commence a dweller there; but my mo&s;t ardent benedictions will ever re&s;t upon it;
<PB N="176" REF="034162_0842_0FFC574746241908">
and the affectionate attachment and approbation of its inhabitants will &s;till con&s;titute one of the principal &s;ources of my complacency. I rejoice in its pro&s;peri|ty; and I cannot hear it named with applau&s;e, but my heart acknowledges an accompanying glow of &s;at|isfaction.</P>
<P>The love of our country has been deemed a univer|&s;al pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;trong mu&s;t be the intere&s;t that can &s;uper&s;ede its operations. It is ob&s;erved, that the na|tives of every climate, and the &s;ubjects of every State and kingdom, are &s;o &s;trongly operated on by local at|tachments, and their con&s;equent partialities, as to con|ceive their own &s;pot of earth the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible &s;ituations. The elegant &s;ong&s;tre&s;s of the Albion world does not paint too highly, when &s;he &s;ays:
<Q><L>The <HI>pea&s;ant of the Alps</HI> his cottage forms,</L>
<L>And builds his humble, happy home.</L>
<L>Unenvied is the rich domain,</L>
<L>That far beneath him on the plain</L>
<L>Waves its wide harve&s;ts, and its olive groves:</L>
<L>More dear to him his hut, with plaintain thatch'd,</L>
<L>Where long his unambitious heart attach'd,</L>
<L>Finds all he wi&s;hes&mdash;all he loves.</L></Q></P>
<P>In&s;tances have been known, where a fondne&s;s for the &s;cenes of infantile life, and the &s;portive days of boyhood, have enabled per&s;ons, in an advanced &s;tage of their exi&s;tence, to encounter numerous difficulties, for the purpo&s;e of vi&s;iting a &s;pot, which fancy hath continued to paint in all the vivid colours be&s;towed on it by the glowing imagination of youth. It is true, if, urged by tender recollection, they quit their <HI>more</HI> commodious accommodations, the probability is, that, rendered peevi&s;h and frigid by years, and not allow|ing for the vici&s;&s;itudes of time, the termination of a fatiguing jaunt may generally give them expre&s;&s;ions and feelings, &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Doctor John&s;on, when, departing from the city of London, he devoted a por|tion of his time to the plea&s;ingly remembered haunts of Litchfield. Yet, I conceive, the multiplication of in&s;tances of this kind will not break the charm: The
<PB N="177" REF="034162_0843_0FFC5745BACD0A20">
fa&s;cinating influence of juvenile plea&s;ures will &s;till re|main; they will take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart with plea&s;|ing accompaniments; and <HI>memory</HI> will &s;till revert to the native lawns, the native hills, groves, meadows, rocks, and &s;treams, with all tho&s;e corre&s;ponding rap|tures which thrilled the bo&s;om, when fir&s;t the dawn of admiration awakened every &s;en&s;e to the &s;weet enthu&s;i|a&s;m of new-born rapture.</P>
<P>Yes, the <HI>amor patrioe</HI> is a natural, a beneficial, and a laudable pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;May it ever glow with Decian energy in the Columbian bo&s;om&mdash;May we continue to regard, with filial veneration, our country's Warriors, her Patriots, and her State&s;men&mdash;and may we enume|rate, with fervid exultation, tho&s;e able proficients in excellence, who daily throng the &s;plendid paths of fame!</P>
<P><HI>Naturally</HI> and unalterably attached to this New World, I love and revere its Con&s;titution, its laws, and its government; and I would obliterate every circum&s;tance that might either immediately, or eventu|ally, envelop in clouds its dignity, its honour, or that national magnitude, to which it is &s;o rapidly advanc|ing.

And is that arrangement, I would a&s;k, which appropriates to <HI>fir&s;t rate abilities,</HI> for exertions that require <HI>every faculty of the mind, and all of life,</HI> only a &s;canty pittance, that will &s;carcely com|mand the articles nece&s;&s;ary to exi&s;tence, either honour|able or judicious?

<P>THE reader is reque&s;ted to con&s;ider the four &s;uc|ceeding numbers as &s;upplementary to an E&s;&s;ay, which made its appearance, &s;ome years &s;ince, in a pe|riodical publication of a mi&s;cellaneous nature. The particular paper to which I advert, was entitled, <HI>The Equality of the Sexes;</HI> and, however well I may think of that compo&s;ition, as I do not conceive that the &s;ub|ject is exhau&s;ted, I have thought proper, treading in the &s;ame path, to &s;et about collecting a few hints, which may &s;erve as additional, illu&s;trative, or orna|mental.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, by way of exordium, I take leave to congratulate my fair country-women, on the happy revolution which the few pa&s;t years has made in their favour; that in the&s;e infant republics, where, within my remembrance, the u&s;e of the needle was the prin|cipal attainment which was thought <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for a wo|man, the lovely proficient is now permitted to appro|priate a moiety of her time to &s;tudies of a more ele|vated and elevating nature. Female academies are every where e&s;tabli&s;hing, and right plea&s;ant is the ap|pellation to my ear.</P>
<P>Yes, in this younger world, "the Rights of Women" begin to be under&s;tood; we &s;eem, at length, deter|mined to do ju&s;tice to THE SEX; and, improving on the opinions of a Woll&s;tonecraft, we are ready to con|tend for the <HI>quantity,</HI> as well as <HI>quality,</HI> of mind. The younger part of the female world have now an ine&s;ti|mable prize put into their hands; and it depends on the ri&s;ing generation to refute a &s;entiment, which, &s;till retaining its advocates, grounds its arguments on the incompatibility of the pre&s;ent enlarged plan of female

education, with tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary occupations, that mu&s;t ever be con&s;idered as proper to the department and compri&s;ed in the duties of a judiciou&s;ly in&s;tructed and elegant woman; and, if our daughters will combine their efforts, converts to the new regulations will every day multiply among us. To argue again&s;t facts, is indeed contending with both wind and tide; and, borne down by accumulating examples, conviction of the utility of the pre&s;ent plans will pervade the public mind, and not a di&s;&s;enting voice will be heard.</P>
<P>I may be accu&s;ed of enthu&s;ia&s;m; but &s;uch is my confidence in THE SEX, that I expect to &s;ee our young women forming a new era in female hi&s;tory. They will oppo&s;e them&s;elves to every trivial and unworthy monopolizer of time; and it will be apparent, that the adorning their per&s;ons is not with them a <HI>primary</HI> object. They will know how to appreciate per&s;onal advantages; and, con&s;idering them as be&s;towed by Nature, or Nature's God, they will hold them in due e&s;timation: Yet, con&s;cious that they confer no <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> excellence on the <HI>temporary</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, their admea&s;ure|ment of <HI>real virtue</HI> will be entirely dive&s;ted of all tho&s;e <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing ideas,</HI> which originate in a beautiful exte|rior. The noble expan&s;ion conferred by a liberal ed|ucation will teach them <HI>humility;</HI> for it will give them a glance of tho&s;e va&s;t tracts of knowledge which they can never explore, until they are accommodated with far other powers than tho&s;e at pre&s;ent a&s;&s;igned them; and they will contemplate their removal to a higher order of beings, as a de&s;irable event.</P>
<P>Mild benignity, with all the mode&s;t virtues, and ev|ery &s;exual grace&mdash;the&s;e they will carefully cultivate; for they will have <HI>learned,</HI> that in no character they can &s;o effectually charm, as in that in which nature de|&s;igned them the <HI>pre-eminence.</HI> They will accu&s;tom them&s;elves to reflection; they will inve&s;tigate accu|rately, and rea&s;on will point their conclu&s;ions; Yet they will not be a&s;&s;uming; the characteri&s;tic trait will &s;till remain; and retiring &s;weetne&s;s will in&s;ure them that con&s;ideration and re&s;pect, which they do not pre|&s;ume

Thinking ju&s;tly will not only en|large their minds, and refine their ideas; but it will correct their di&s;po&s;itions, humanize their feelings, and pre&s;ent them the <HI>friends of their &s;pecies.

When their &s;phere of action is en|larged, when they become wives and mothers, they will fill with honour the parts allotted them. Ac|quainted, theoretically, with the nature of their &s;pe|cies, and experimentally with them&s;elves, they will not expect to meet, in wedlock, with tho&s;e faultle&s;s be|ings, who &s;o frequently i&s;&s;ue, armed at all points, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeming brain of the noveli&s;t.

<P><HI>The idea of the incapability</HI> of women, is, we conceive, in this <HI>enlightened age,</HI> totally <HI>inadmi&s;&s;ible;</HI> and we have concluded, that e&s;tabli&s;hing the <HI>expediency</HI> of admitting them to &s;hare the ble&s;&s;ings of equality, will remove every ob&s;tacle to their advancement.

<P>Women, circum&s;cribed in their education within very narrow limits, and con&s;tantly depre&s;&s;ed by their occupations, have, neverthele&s;s, tinged the cheek of manhood with a guilty &s;uffu&s;ion, for a pu&s;illanimous capitulation with the enemies of their country. Quit|ting the loom and the di&s;taff, they have beheld, with indignation, their hu&s;bands and their &s;ons flee in bat|tle: With cla&s;ped hands, and determined re&s;olution, they have placed them&s;elves in their paths, ob&s;tructing their pa&s;&s;age, and in&s;i&s;ting, with heroic firmne&s;s, on their immediate return to death or conque&s;t! They have anxiou&s;ly examined the dead bodies of their &s;laughtered &s;ons; and if the fatal wounds were receiv|ed in front, thus evincing that they have bravely faced the foe, the fond recollection of their valour has be|come a &s;ource of con&s;olation, and they have &s;ung a <HI>requiem</HI> to their &s;orrows! Women, in the heat of ac|tion, have mounted the rampart with undaunted cour|age, arre&s;ted the progre&s;s of the foe, and bravely re&s;|cued their be&s;ieged dwellings! They have &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed them&s;elves to tyranny and the galling yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion! A&s;&s;embling in crowds, they have arm|ed them&s;elves for the combat&mdash;they have mingled amid the battling ranks&mdash;they have fought heroically&mdash;and their well-timed and well-concerted mea&s;ures have emancipated their country! They have hazard|ed the &s;troke of death in its mo&s;t frightful form; and they have &s;ubmitted to bonds and impri&s;onment, for the redemption of their captive hu&s;bands!</P>
<P>The character of the Spartan women is marked with uncommon firmne&s;s. At the &s;hrine of patrioti&s;m they immolated nature. Undaunted bravery and unim|peached honour, was, in their e&s;timation, far beyond affection. The name of Citizen po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, for them, greater charms than that of Mother; and &s;o highly did they prize the warrior's meed, that they are &s;aid to have &s;hed tears of joy over the bleeding bodies of their wounded &s;ons!</P>

<P>The Northern nations have generally been in the habit of venerating the Female Sex. Con&s;tantly em|ployed in bending the bow, in exploring the haunts of tho&s;e animals, who were the victims of their plea&s;ures and their pa&s;&s;ions, or of urging again&s;t their &s;pecies the mi&s;&s;ive &s;hafts of death, they neverthele&s;s bani&s;hed their ferocity, and a&s;&s;umed the milde&s;t manners, when a&s;&s;ociating with their mothers, their &s;i&s;ters, their mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, or their wives.

his wi&s;hes, and e&s;tabli&s;hed his preten&s;ions, by em|inent virtue, and a long &s;eries of unbroken attentions.</P>
<P>A per&s;ua&s;ion, that the common Father of the uni|ver&s;e manife&s;ts him&s;elf more readily to females than to males, has, at one period or another, obtained, more or le&s;s, in every divi&s;ion of the globe. The Germans, the Britons, and the Scandinavians&mdash;from the&s;e the &s;uppo&s;ition received an ea&s;y credence. The Grecian women delivered oracles&mdash;the Romans venerated the Sibyls&mdash;among the people of God, the Jewi&s;h women prophe&s;ied&mdash;the predictions of the Egyptian matron were much re&s;pected&mdash;and we are a&s;&s;ured, that the mo&s;t barbarous nations referred to their females, what|ever they fancied beyond the reach of human efforts: And hence we find women in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the my&s;te|ries of religion, the <HI>arcana</HI> of phy&s;ic, and the ceremo|nies of incantation. Writers a&s;&s;ert, that &s;everal nations have a&s;cribed to women the gift of pre&s;cience, con|ceiving that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed qualities approximating to divinity; and the ferocious German, embo&s;omed in his native woods, renders a kind of devotional reve|rence to the Female Sex.</P>
<P>Such is the character of tho&s;e periods, when women were inve&s;ted with <HI>undue elevation;</HI> and the rever&s;e pre&s;ents THE SEX in a &s;tate of humiliation, altogether as unwarrantable. The females among the &s;avages of our country, are repre&s;ented as &s;ubmitting to the mo&s;t melancholy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing oppre&s;&s;ion; &s;laves to the ferocious pa&s;&s;ions and irregular appetites of tho&s;e tyrannical u&s;urpers, who brutally and cruelly outrage their feelings. They encounter for their &s;upport, in|credible hard&s;hips and toils, in&s;omuch that, weary of their own wretched exi&s;tence, the women on the banks of the Oronoko, urged by compa&s;&s;ion, not unfrequently &s;mother the female infant in the hour of its birth; and &s;he who hath attained &s;ufficient fortitude to per|form this <HI>maternal</HI> act, e&s;teems her&s;elf entitled to ad|ditional re&s;pect. Commodore Byron, in his account of the inhabitants of South-America, informs us, that the men exerci&s;e a mo&s;t de&s;potic authority over their
<PB N="196" REF="034162_0862_0FFC5710E9243618">
wives, whom they con&s;ider in the &s;ame view they do any other part of their property, and di&s;po&s;e of them accordingly: Even their common treatment of them is cruel; for, although the toil and hazard of procur|ing food lies entirely on the women, yet they are not &s;uffered to touch any part of it, till their imperious ma&s;ters are &s;atisfied, and then he a&s;&s;igns them their portion, which is generally very &s;canty, and &s;uch as he has not an appetite for, him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus have the Sex continued the &s;port of contin|gencies; unnaturally &s;ubjected to extremes; alter|nately in the mount of exaltation, and in the valley of unmerited degradation. Is it wonderful, then, that they evince &s;o little &s;tability of character? Rather, is it not a&s;toni&s;hing, that their attainments are &s;o numer|ous, and &s;o con&s;iderable? Turning over the annals of different ages, we have &s;elected a number of names, which we purpo&s;e, in our next E&s;&s;ay, to cite, as vouch|ers of THE SEX's merit; nor can we doubt, that their united &s;uffrages will, on a candid inve&s;tigation, effec|tually e&s;tabli&s;h the female right to that <HI>equality with their brethren, which, it is conceived, is a&s;&s;igned them in the Order of Nature.</HI></P>

<P>It is not our purpo&s;e to analyze the properties of mind; we are inclined to think, that accurately to di&s;|criminate, or draw the intellectual line, is beyond the power of the be&s;t informed metaphy&s;ician within the purlieus of humanity. Be&s;ides, as we write for the <HI>ma|ny,</HI> and as it is notorious that a number of <HI>well atte&s;ted facts</HI> have abundantly more weight with <HI>the multitude,</HI> than the fine&s;t &s;pun &s;y&s;tems which ever i&s;&s;ued from the archives of theory, we &s;hall proceed to &s;ummon our witne&s;&s;es, arranging their te&s;timonies with as much or|der, as the cur&s;ory turning over a number of volumes, to which a deficiency in memory nece&s;&s;itates us to apply, will permit; and here, (le&s;t the patience of our readers &s;hould reluct at the idea of the mot|ley circle, to which they may apprehend they are to be introduced) we take leave to inform them, that we &s;hall be careful to abridge, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the copious depo&s;itions which may pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Many centuries have revolved, &s;ince the era, when writers of eminence, giving a catalogue of celebrated women, have made the number to amount to eight hundred and forty-five: From the&s;e, and &s;ucceeding atte&s;tators, we &s;hall &s;elect a few, not perhaps the mo&s;t &s;triking, but &s;uch as occur the mo&s;t readily. Our ob|ject is to prove, by examples, that the minds of women are <HI>naturally</HI> as &s;u&s;ceptible of every improvement, as tho&s;e of men. In the cour&s;e of our examination, an obvious conclu&s;ion will, we conceive, force it&s;elf on ev|ery attentive and ingenuous reader. If the triumphs and attainments of THE SEX, under the various oppre&s;|&s;ions with which they have &s;truggled, have been thus &s;plendid, how would they have been augmented, had not ignorant or intere&s;ted men, after clipping their wings, contrived to erect around them almo&s;t in&s;ur|mountable barriers.

<P>A certain &s;overeign, of avaricious memory, was &s;o fond of ama&s;&s;ing trea&s;ure, that he arbitrarily compelled a very large proportion of his &s;ubjects to labour in the mines; but while his maje&s;ty's ingots were rapidly augmenting, the grounds remained uncultivated; fam|ine advanced with ha&s;ty &s;trides; and the dreary pro&s;|pect every moment gathered darkne&s;s. No one po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficient intrepidity to remon&s;trate&mdash;the de&s;pot's nod was fate&mdash;from his decrees there was no appeal&mdash;and the love of life, although its eligibles may be in a great mea&s;ure dimini&s;hed, is generally a paramount pa&s;&s;ion. In this emergency, the ingenuity of the queen &s;ugge&s;ted a re&s;ource that &s;natched the nation from the horrors of that <HI>dearth</HI> which had &s;eemed &s;o inevitable. She &s;ecretly employed an arti&s;t to produce an exact imitation of tho&s;e luxuries, in which the king mo&s;t de|lighted, a variety of fi&s;h and fowl&mdash;bread and fruits of the mo&s;t delicious kind, made of pure gold, were expeditiou&s;ly completed, and di&s;played in order on the <HI>co&s;tly</HI> board&mdash;the table was highly decorated&mdash;and, when every thing was complete, the king, (after hav|ing been purpo&s;ely diverted from taking his cu&s;toma|ry

His Maje&s;ty took a &s;eat&mdash;for a moment, a&s;toni&s;hment &s;u&s;pended even the clamours of hunger, and his mind was occupied by admiration of the imagination of the queen, and the deceptive abilities of the arti&s;t. The event was proportioned to the mo&s;t &s;anguine expec|tations of the lady. The mines were &s;uddenly di&s;|peopled, and the earth again produced the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Their fortitude and heroi&s;m cannot be &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed. Li&s;ten to a woman of Sparta, reduced by mel|ancholy ca&s;ualties to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude&mdash;She was captured, and afterwards &s;old as a &s;lave. The que&s;tion was put by him on whom her very exi&s;tence &s;eemed to depend&mdash;<HI>"What knowe&s;t thou?" "To be free,"</HI> was her characteri&s;tic reply: But the unfeeling de&s;pot, unin|fluenced by indubitable indications of a noble mind, proceeded to impo&s;e his ignominious commands; to which &s;he di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately returned, "<HI>you are unworthy of me;</HI>" and in&s;tantly re&s;igned her&s;elf to death. For|titude and heroi&s;m was a con&s;picuous trait in, and gave uncommon dignity to, the character of the Ro|man ladies. Arria, the wife of Paetus, a Roman of con&s;ular dignity, is an illu&s;trious in&s;tance of that tran&s;|cendent elevation, of which the female mind is &s;u&s;cep|tible. With per&s;evering firmne&s;s, and a tenderne&s;s not to be exceeded, &s;he continued unwearied in her en|deavours to procure the life of her hu&s;band&mdash;long &s;he cheri&s;hed hope; but, when the plea&s;ing vi&s;ion fled, and the portending &s;torm was bur&s;ting over their heads: In that tremendous moment, while the di&s;ap|pointed man, trembling on the verge of di&s;&s;olution, had not the courage to point the deadly weapon&mdash;with that exqui&s;ite delicacy, true fortitude, and <HI>faithfulne&s;s of affection, which is &s;o highly &s;exual, &s;he fir&s;t imprinted on her own bo&s;om the characters of death;</HI> and, animated by that &s;ublime con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s becoming a being more than half cele&s;tial, &s;he then pre&s;ented him the pointed dagger, with this con&s;olatory a&s;&s;urance&mdash;"<HI>Paetus, this gives me no pain.</HI>"</P>

Yet we find it impo&s;&s;ible &s;o &s;peedily to clo&s;e this part of our examination; and from the multitude of examples in the I&s;land of Great-Britain, we produce the Lady Jane Gray, who &s;eemed an exemplification of every virtue and every grace which has been attributed to the male or female character. The excellent under&s;tanding the received from nature was opened and improved by uniform ap|plication. At &s;ixteen, her judgment had attained a high degree of maturity. She was at that age an a|dept both in the Greek and Latin languages; and &s;he was able to declare that her Greek Plato was a more plea&s;ing entertainment to her than all tho&s;e enchanting plea&s;ures u&s;ually &s;o captivating to the unexperienced mind. Nurtured in the bo&s;om of parental affection, and of tender friend&s;hip&mdash;happy in the di&s;tingui&s;hing regards of her &s;overeign, and permitted the &s;ublime en|joyment of intellectual pur&s;uits, &s;he had no ambition for the pageantry of royalty, and her advancement to the throne was an era, over which &s;he dropped the melancholy tear. We are &s;en&s;ible that in adverting to the&s;e traits in a character, affectingly intere&s;ting, we do in fact anticipate other divi&s;ions of our &s;ubject; but, contemplating a mind thus richly furni&s;hed, it is diffi|cult to con&s;ider &s;eparately, endowments &s;o nicely blend|ed, and reflecting on each other &s;uch unu&s;ual lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age of the Lady Jane, from the throne to the &s;caffold, was very &s;hort&mdash;her impo&s;ed queen&s;hip continued only ten days; yet &s;he &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed at their duration, and &s;he received, with <HI>heroic fortitude,</HI> the me&s;&s;age of death. The lover and the hu&s;band, who&s;e vows &s;he had recently accepted, was al&s;o under &s;entence of death; and, on the morning a&s;&s;igned for their martyrdom, he &s;olicited for a parting interview; with &s;olemn firmne&s;s &s;he refu&s;ed his reque&s;t&mdash;yet her re&s;olution originated not in a deficiency of tenderne&s;s;
<PB N="202" REF="034162_0868_0FFA662DE5682048">
but it was nerved by an apprehen&s;ion that her &s;en&s;i|bilities, thus &s;timulated, might &s;urmount her fortitude. With mode&s;t re&s;ignation &s;he pur&s;ued her way to the place of execution&mdash;the officers of death, bearing the body of her hu&s;band, while the headle&s;s trunk yet &s;treamed with blood, met her on her pa&s;&s;age&mdash;neither of them had completed their &s;eventeenth year&mdash;&s;he looked&mdash;&s;he &s;ighed&mdash;and then, rea&s;&s;uming her compo&s;|ed &s;edatene&s;s, de&s;ired her conductors to proceed&mdash;&s;he mounted the &s;caffold with an accelerated &s;tep&mdash;&s;he ad|dre&s;&s;ed the &s;urrounding &s;pectators&mdash;&s;he committed the care of her per&s;on to her woman; and, with a coun|tenance de&s;criptive of &s;erene dignity, bowed her head to the executioner. Thus peri&s;hed a &s;potle&s;s victim of de&s;poti&s;m and of bigotry in the bloom of youth and beauty, rich in innocence, and adorned with every lit|erary accompli&s;hment and &s;exual grace. Late&s;t po&s;|terity will lament her fate, and many hearts will join to execrate the &s;anguinary mea&s;ures which procured it. Under this head we produce but one more te&s;timony.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Anna A&s;kew, a young lady of great merit, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed al&s;o of a beautiful exterior, lived during the tyranny of Henry VIII. of England; a de&s;pot, who &s;eemed to conceive the female world created on purpo&s;e to admini&s;ter to his plea&s;ures, or to become the victims of his cruelty and implacability. Mi&s;s A&s;kew was arraigned as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or; her crime was, a denial of the <HI>real pre&s;ence in the euchari&s;t;</HI> and for this atrocious offence, &s;he was rigorou&s;ly impri&s;oned, and &s;ubjected to a &s;eries of barbarities that would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">graced even &s;avage inhumanity.

unbending integrity furni&s;hed the pretence, and &s;he was, without further delay, put to the torture; but &s;till her fortitude receded not; and her heroic &s;ilence evinced her abundantly &s;uperior to their unmanly cruelties. The enraged chancellor, in who&s;e pre&s;ence &s;he &s;uffered, tran&s;ported with diabolic zeal, gra&s;ping with his own hands the cords, violently &s;tretched the rack, and almo&s;t tore her body a&s;under; while yet unappalled, her fortitude for&s;ook her not, and her triumph over her barbarous tormentors was complete.</P>
<P>Her death-warrant was next made out, and &s;he re|ceived the &s;entence which condemned her to the flames, as an emancipation from every evil. All her joints di&s;located by the rack, &s;he was borne to the place of execution; and there, after being bound to the &s;take, was offered her life on condition of retracting her &s;up|po&s;ed error; but &s;he con&s;i&s;tently rejected an exi&s;tence to be purcha&s;ed only by the forfeiture of that con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of rectitude, which the virtuous &s;o well know how to prize; and as the flames that were her pa&s;&s;port to regions of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, enkindled around her, a &s;ong of thank&s;giving was on her lips, and her exultation evidently augmented.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> They are equally brave. Bravery is not a quality which figures <HI>gracefully</HI> in the li&s;t of female virtues, nor are we anxious it &s;hould take rank in the catalogue&mdash;far from it; we &s;hould rather lament to &s;ee it become a characteri&s;tic trait. We would have women &s;upport them&s;elves with con&s;i&s;tent firmne&s;s under the various exigencies of life, but we would not arm them with the weapons of death: Yet, when con|tending for <HI>equality of &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l,</HI> it may be nece&s;&s;ary to prove the <HI>capability</HI> of the female mind, to rear to perfection whatever &s;eeds may be adventitiou&s;ly implanted there|in.

<P>Jane of Flanders next pre&s;ents: This lady, during the impri&s;onment of her hu&s;band, nobly &s;upported the declining honours of her hou&s;e: With her infant &s;on in her arms, &s;he met the a&s;&s;embling citizens, and pa|thetically deploring her misfortunes, &s;he &s;ecured their exertions in her favour.

<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THEY are equally patriotic. We have, in &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me mea&s;ure, fore&s;talled this article. The Grecian women have produced their te&s;timonies, and that preference which they demon&s;trably mani|fe&s;ted to the character Citizen; e&s;timating it beyond the endearing appellations, Wife and Mother, incon|trovertibly e&s;tabli&s;hes their &s;ex's <HI>capability</HI> of experienc|ing with an ardour <HI>not to be exceeded,</HI> the patriotic glow; and yet it is true, that &s;exual occupations fre|quently humiliating, and generally far removed from whatever has a tendency to elevate the mind, may rationally be &s;uppo&s;ed to chill, in the female bo&s;om, the fine fervours of the <HI>amor patrioe.</HI></P>
<P>Women are not u&s;ually exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e exten&s;ive contemplations which engage the legi&s;lator: They are not called on to arm in their country's cau&s;e; to ap|pear in the well fought field, or to put their lives at hazard: But when they part with him in whom is centered their deare&s;t hopes, who blends the char|acters lover, friend, hu&s;band and protector&mdash;when they re&s;ign to the ho&s;tile career the blooming youth

whom from infancy they have watched with all a mother's tenderne&s;s, and who&s;e rich maturity hath become the pride and con&s;olation of their declining life&mdash;in tho&s;e moments of angui&s;h, their heroi&s;m and their fortitude are indi&s;putably evinced. Nor is the patrioti&s;m of the chief arrayed for the battle; nor his, who devotes him&s;elf with all a &s;tate&s;man's integrity to the public weal, condemned to an ordeal more &s;evere.</P>
<P>The <HI>patrioti&s;m</HI> of the Roman ladies, procured a &s;enatorial decree that funeral orations &s;hould be pro|nounced from the ro&s;trum in their prai&s;e: Repeatedly they &s;aved their country. And the <HI>patrioti&s;m</HI> of the mother and wi&s;e of Coriolanus, while it &s;natched Rome from impending ruin, devoted to inevitable de|&s;truction the hu&s;band and the &s;on: Hence towered the temple con&s;ecrated to feminine honour; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed they had purcha&s;ed this di&s;tinction at a very high price. The venerable Senate, too, again interpo&s;ed; public thanks were decreed; and men were ordered, on all occa&s;ions, to yield prece|dence to women.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> They are as influential. The a&s;cendency obtained by females, is &s;o notorious, as to have become proverbial. In&s;tances are multiplied, wherein women have bent to their purpo&s;es the &s;tronge&s;t ma&s;culine under&s;tanding. Sam&s;on, the victim of female blan|di&s;hments, is not a &s;ingular in&s;tance. The example cited under the la&s;t article, is in point. Coriolanus rejected with unbending &s;everity &s;upplicating friend|&s;hip, garbed in &s;enatorial robes; &s;ucceeding deputies plead in vain&mdash;The mini&s;ters of religion, cloathed in &s;acerdotal habits, joined in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion&mdash;they crowded around the warrior, commi&s;&s;ioned to advocate a &s;inking people's cau&s;e; &s;till, however, he continued obdurate, inflexibly firm and &s;teady to his plans. But Veturia and Volumnia, his wife and mother, attended by the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of the Roman ladies, appear&mdash;they &s;hed torrents of tears&mdash;they embrace his knees&mdash;the hero is di&s;armed&mdash;his heart is melted&mdash;his re&s;ent|ment and his re&s;olutions vani&s;h together&mdash;and Rome is &s;aved.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="034162_0873_0FFC5C6D1BE1E4C8">
<HI>Seventhly,</HI> They are as energetic, and as eloquent, Women always decree with fervour: Did it depend on them, their movements would be deci&s;ive. Their expre&s;&s;ions are often as &s;trongly marked, as they are vehement; and both their plans and the execution thereof, are endowed with all the vigour that exi&s;ting regulations will permit. Their eloquence is indi&s;pu|table. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a richne&s;s of fancy; their words are &s;ufficiently copious; and education, when they are indulged with its aids, pre&s;cribes the proper rules. A&s;pa&s;ia, of Miletus, it is well known, taught the im|mortal Socrates rhetoric and politics. And, when Rome groaned under the enormous cruelties of her &s;econd Triumvirate, the three barbarians by whom &s;he was en&s;laved, and who had armed them&s;elves for the de&s;truction of her citizens, as if de&s;irous of &s;pread|ing every po&s;&s;ible calamity, &s;eized not only the lives, but the trea&s;ures of the people, and equally greedy of gold as of blood, after exhau&s;ting every other mode of plunder, turned their rapacious views on tho&s;e re&s;pect|able matrons, who had hitherto been exempted from pecuniary exactions; an exorbitant tax was levied on every individual female, and the con&s;ternation oc|ca&s;ioned by this unheard of a&s;&s;umption, was propor|tioned to the di&s;tre&s;s of which it was productive.</P>
<P>In this extraordinary emergency, the oppre&s;&s;ed fe|males earne&s;tly &s;olicited the aid of tho&s;e advocates who were appointed to plead the cau&s;e of the injured and defencele&s;s; but the orators, fearful of incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of tho&s;e who had u&s;urped the power of life and death, refu&s;ed to interfere; and no means of redre&s;s appearing, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to an impo&s;ition acknowl|edged grievous, &s;eemed inevitable: It was, however, re&s;erved to the talents and exertions of Horten&s;ia to furni&s;h the de&s;ired aid.</P>
<P>This lady inherited all the abilities of her father; and &s;he pre&s;ented her&s;elf a voluntary advocate for her &s;ex. With mode&s;t intrepid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y &s;he opened, conducted, and clo&s;ed the pleadings. Per&s;ua&s;ion dwelt on her tongue: Her arguments re&s;ulting from rectitude,

were pointed by rea&s;on: And it will be conceived that her rhetorical powers mu&s;t have been of the fir&s;t rate, when it is remembered that <HI>the countenances of the tyrants betrayed &s;udden and evident tokens of that remor&s;e which was then fir&s;t enkindled in their bo&s;oms;</HI> the hue of guilt pervaded their cheeks, and they ha&s;tily repeal|ed the injurious decree. For the brow of Horten|&s;ia, fame prepared an immortal wreath: To the ut|mo&s;t gratitude of her cotemporaries &s;he was entitled: Her triumph was the triumph of virtue and of talents: She enkindled even in the callous brea&s;ts of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, the almo&s;t extingui&s;hed &s;parks of humanity; and &s;he &s;tands on the page of hi&s;tory, a pattern of dauntle&s;s courage, and an example of genuine eloquence.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> They are as faithful and as per&s;evering in their attachments. Here countle&s;s witne&s;&s;es crowd on retention, and the greate&s;t difficulty is in choo&s;ing judiciou&s;ly. Repeatedly have I &s;een the faithfully attached female, firmly per&s;evering in that affection which was fir&s;t implanted in the &s;oil of innocence, and fondly watching with tender anxiety every &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;ed man: With patient a&s;&s;iduity &s;he hath hung over the couch, and &s;ought to mitigate the pangs of him, who&s;e licentious conduct had brought ruin on her&s;elf and her unoffending children! Had circum|&s;tances been rever&s;ed, <HI>divorce</HI> would have &s;ucceeded&mdash;a ho&s;pital mu&s;t have &s;heltered the helple&s;s woman; and, had &s;he received from the man &s;he had injured any trivial attention, the unmerited gratuity would have re&s;ounded through the circle of their connexions, been dwelt on with rapture, and echoed by every tongue. But when virtue is the ba&s;is; when acts of kindne&s;s cement the union, THE SEX in many in&s;tan|ces have &s;et no bound to that faithful attachment which their hearts have exultingly acknowledged. Filial duty&mdash;conjugal affection&mdash;per&s;evering con&s;tancy&mdash;the&s;e receive in the female bo&s;om the highe&s;t perfec|tion of which they are, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>

in hi&s;tory, would yet, in like &s;ituation, obtain many imitators; and the feelings of a daughter would prompt, for the relief of the authors of her being, the noble&s;t exertions. The celebrated Mrs. Roper, elde&s;t daughter of Sir Thomas Moore, continued his affec|tionate &s;olace during his impri&s;onment: With heart-affecting angui&s;h &s;he ru&s;hed through the guards to catch, from the illu&s;trious martyr, a la&s;t embrace. Bending under a weight of calamity, &s;he obtained permi&s;&s;ion to pay him &s;epulchral honours; and, re|gardle&s;s of the tyrant's power, &s;he purcha&s;ed the vene|rable head of the meritorious &s;ufferer: Yet, too noble to permit the con&s;equences to fall upon another, with dauntle&s;s courage &s;he became her own accu&s;er; and, loaded with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etters for two crimes, "for having watch|ed the head of her father as a relique, and for having pre&s;erved his books and writings," appeared with un|concern before her judges&mdash;ju&s;tified her&s;elf with that eloquence which virtue be&s;tows on injured merit&mdash;commanding admiration and re&s;pect&mdash;and &s;pent the remainder of her life in &s;olitude, in &s;orrow, and in &s;tudy.</P>
<P>But women, unable to &s;upport exi&s;tence, when de|prived of tho&s;e with whom they have exchanged the nuptial vow, have mounted the funeral pile, and ha&s;t|ened to rejoin their decea&s;ed partners in other worlds. Portia, the daughter of Cato Uticen&s;is, and wife of Brutus, hearing of the death of her hu&s;band, di&s;dained to live; and when debarred acce&s;s to the u&s;ual weapons of de&s;truction, made her exit by re&s;olutely &s;wallowing burning coals of &s;ire!

Moreover, when led into captivity, &s;he knew how to <HI>bring into &s;ubjection, her feelings; &s;he endured misfortune with the heroi&s;m of a no|ble &s;pirit, and found a &s;olace for the lo&s;s of royalty, and the pageantry of a throne, in tho&s;e rational pur&s;uits, which &s;olitude and freedom from care uninterruptedly permit.</HI> Longinus was her preceptor and friend; and &s;he was worthy of his tuition and preferable attachment. Elizabeth of England was endowed with energetic talents; her reign was glorious for the people over which &s;he pre&s;ided; &s;he was undoubtedly a great pol|itician, and governed with uniform vigour; &s;he is characterized as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing much penetration, and an under&s;tanding fruitful of re&s;ources; her foreign ne|gociations were conducted with propriety and dignity; her mind was opened and poli&s;hed by all the aids of an exten&s;ive education, and adver&s;ity was among her preceptors. Chri&s;tina, queen of Sweden, governed her &s;ubjects twenty-one years, with uniform wi&s;dom and unimpeached prudence, when &s;he magnanimou&s;ly re&s;igned her crown; thus giving a rare example of an elevation of intellect, which has not been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed.</P>

Sappho, the Le&s;bian poete&s;s, was admired by the ancients&mdash;&s;he produced many poems, and was addre&s;&s;ed as the tenth Mu&s;e.

Ca&s;&s;andra, a Venetian lady, attained an accurate &s;kill in lan|guages, and made great proficiency in the learning of her time; &s;he compo&s;ed with facility, both in numbers and in pro&s;e, in the language of Homer, Virgil, and Dante; &s;he was a proficient in the philo&s;ophy of her own and preceding ages; &s;he rendered theology har|monious; &s;he &s;upported the&s;es with brilliancy; &s;he lectured publickly at Padua; &s;he blended the fine arts with her &s;erious &s;tudies; and the mild complacency of her manners con&s;tituted the completion of her character: She received homage from &s;overeign pon|tiffs, and &s;overeign princes; and &s;he continued an or|nament of her Sex, and of humanity, one hundred and two years.</P>
<P>The daughter of Sir Thomas Moore, Mrs. Roper, already cited under the eighth article, who&s;e virtues were poli&s;hed by literary attainments, corre&s;ponded in Latin with the celebrated Era&s;mus, and &s;ucce&s;sfully appropriated many years of her life to &s;tudy: Her daughter inherited her erudition, and her amiable qualifications. The Seymours, &s;i&s;ters, and nieces of a king, wrote elegantly in Latin. I&s;abella of Ro&s;era, in Spain, by her &s;ub&s;tantial arguments, natural deduc|tions, and able rhetoric, greatly augmented the num|ber of believing Jews; the great church of Barcelona was open for the exertion of her pulpitorial abilities; and &s;he acquired much honour by her commentaries upon the learned Scotus.

Mary Stuart, queen of Scotland, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the advantages of exterior, and every &s;exual grace, a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated her mind: Her learning was as remarkable as her beauty; &s;he could, we are informed, write and &s;peak &s;ix languages; her numbers enchanted the Gallic ear; and, at an early age, &s;he pronounced before the French Court a Latin oration, calculated to convince her hear|ers, that literary pur&s;uits are proper to the Female Sex. Beauty could not plead in vain; the lovely &s;peaker exemplified, in her own character and attain|ments, the truth &s;he inculcated; &s;he was, her&s;elf, that happy combination, the practicability of which &s;he la|boured to impre&s;s; and conviction undoubtedly irradi|ated the minds of her audience.</P>
<P>In the thirteenth century, a young lady of Bologna, pur&s;uing, with avidity, the &s;tudy of the Latin lan|guage, and the legi&s;lative in&s;titutions of her country, was able, at the age of twenty-three, to deliver, in the great church of Bologna, a Latin oration, in prai&s;e of a decea&s;ed per&s;on, eminent for virtue; nor was &s;he indebted for the admiration &s;he received, to the indul|gence granted to her youth, or Sex. At the age of twenty-&s;ix, &s;he took the degree of a Doctor of Laws, and commenced her career in this line, by public ex|po&s;itions of the doctrines of Ju&s;tinian: At the age of thirty, her extraordinary merit rai&s;ed her to the chair, where &s;he taught the law to an a&s;toni&s;hing number of pupils, collected from various nations. She joined to her profound knowledge, &s;exual mode&s;ty, and every feminine accompli&s;hment; yet her per&s;onal attractions were ab&s;orbed in the magnitude and &s;plendor of her in|tellectual abilities; and the charms of her exterior only commanded attention, when &s;he cea&s;ed to &s;peak.

<P>I&s;&s;otta Nogarolla was al&s;o an ornament of the fif|teenth century; and Sarochi&s;a of Naples was deemed worthy of a compari&s;on with Taffo. Mode&s;ta Pozzo's defence of her Sex did her honour; &s;he was, her&s;elf, an example of excellence. Gabrielle, daughter of a king, found lei&s;ure to devote to her pen; and her lit|erary pur&s;uits contributed to her u&s;efulne&s;s and her happine&s;s. Mary de Gournai rendered her&s;elf famous by her learning. Guyon, by her writings and her &s;ufferings, hath evinced the ju&s;tice of her title to im|mortality. Anna Maria Schurman of Cologne, ap|pears to have been mi&s;tre&s;s of all the u&s;eful and orna|mental learning of the age which &s;he adorned: She was born in 1607; her talents unfolded with extraor|dinary brilliancy: In the bud of her life, at the age of &s;ix years, &s;he cut, with her &s;ci&s;&s;ors, the mo&s;t &s;trik|ing re&s;emblances of every figure which was pre&s;ented to her view, and they were fini&s;hed with a&s;toni&s;hing neatne&s;s. At ten, &s;he was but three hours in learning to embroider. She &s;tudied mu&s;ic, painting, &s;culpture and engraving, and made an admirable proficiency in all tho&s;e arts. The Hebrew, Greek and Latin lan|guages were familiar to her; and &s;he made &s;ome prog|re&s;s in the oriental tongues. She perfectly under&s;tood French, Engli&s;h and Italian, and expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf elo|quently in all tho&s;e languages; and &s;he appropriated a portion of her time, to the acquirement of an exten|&s;ive acquaintance with geography, a&s;tronomy, philo&s;|ophy, and the other &s;ciences: Yet &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much feminine delicacy, and retiring mode&s;ty, that her tal|ents and acquirements had been con&s;igned to oblivion, if Va&s;&s;ius, and other amateurs of literature, had not u&s;hered her, in oppo&s;ition to her wi&s;hes, upon the the|atre of the world: But when &s;he was once known, per&s;ons of erudition, of every de&s;cription, corre&s;pond|ed with her; and tho&s;e in the mo&s;t elevated &s;tations, a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;ought opportunities of &s;eeing and con|ver&s;ing with her.</P>

Mademoi&s;elle Scudery, &s;timulated by nece&s;&s;ity, ren|dered her&s;elf eminent by her writings. Anna de Par|thenay po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great virtues, great talents, and great learning; &s;he read, with facility and plea&s;ure, authors in the Greek and Latin languages; &s;he was a rational theologician; &s;he was a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of mu&s;ic; and was as remarkable for her vocal powers, as for her ex|ecution on the various in&s;truments which &s;he attempt|ed. Catharine de Parthenay, niece to Anna, married to Renatus de Rohan, &s;ignalized her&s;elf by her atten|tion to the education of her children; and her mater|nal cares were crowned with abundant &s;ucce&s;s: Her elde&s;t &s;on was the illu&s;trious Duke of Rohan, who ob|tained immortal honour by his zeal and exertions in the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e; and &s;he was al&s;o mother to Anna de Rohan, who was as illu&s;trious for her genius and piety, as for her birth. She was mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hebrew language; her numbers were beautifully ele|gant; and &s;he &s;upported, with heroic firmne&s;s, the ca|lamities con&s;equent upon the &s;iege of Rochelle.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle le Fevre, celebrated in the literary world by the name of Madame Dacier, gave early te&s;timonies of that fine genius which her father delight|ed to cultivate. Her edition of Callimachus was re|ceived with much applau&s;e. At the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the Duke de Montan&s;ier, &s;he publi&s;hed an edition of Florus, for the u&s;e of the dauphin; &s;he exchanged let|ters with Chri&s;tina, queen of Sweden; &s;he devoted her&s;elf to the education of her &s;on and daughter, who&s;e progre&s;s were proportioned to the abilities of their intere&s;ted preceptre&s;s: Greek and Latin were fa|miliar to her; and &s;he was often addre&s;&s;ed in both tho&s;e languages, by the literati of Europe. Her tran&s;|lation of the Iliad was much admired. She is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great firmne&s;s, genero&s;ity, and equality of temper, and to have been remarkable for her piety. Maria de Sevigne appropriated her hours to the in|&s;truction of her &s;on and daughter; &s;he has enriched the world with eight volumes of letters, which will be read with plea&s;ure by every critic in the French lan|guage.

The character of Mary II. Queen of Eng|land, and con&s;ort to William of Na&s;&s;au, is tran&s;cend|ently amiable. She is delineated as a prince&s;s, endowed with uncommon powers of mind, and beauty of per|&s;on. She was exten&s;ively acquainted with hi&s;tory, was attached to poetry, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good ta&s;te in compo&s;itions of this kind. She had a con&s;iderable knowledge in architecture and gardening; and her dignified conde&s;cen&s;ion, and con&s;i&s;tent piety, were tru|ly admirable and prai&s;e worthy&mdash;Every reader of hi&s;|tory, and lover of virtue, will lament her early exit. The Counte&s;s of Pembroke tran&s;lated from the French, a dramatic piece; &s;he gave a metrical edition of the Book of P&s;alms, and &s;upported an exalted character.</P>
<P>Anna Killigrew, and Anna Wharton, were eminent, both for poetry and painting; and their unblemi&s;hed virtue, and exemplary piety, pointed and greatly en|hanced the value of their other accompli&s;hments. Catharine Phillips was, from early life, a lover of the Mu&s;es; &s;he tran&s;lated Corneille's Tragedy of Pompey into Engli&s;h; and in this, as well as the poems which &s;he publi&s;hed, &s;he was &s;ucce&s;sful. Lady Burleigh, Lady Bacon, Lady Ru&s;&s;ell, and Mrs. Killigrew, daugh|ters of Sir Anthony Cook, received from their father a ma&s;culine education; and their prodigious improve|ment was an ample compen&s;ation for his paternal in|dulgence: They were eminent for genius and virtue, and obtained an accurate knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages. The writings of the Dutche&s;s of Newca&s;tle were voluminous; &s;he is produced as the fir&s;t Engli&s;h lady who attempted what has &s;ince been termed polite literature.

<P>WE take leave to repeat, that we are not de&s;irous to array THE SEX in martial habiliments; we do not wi&s;h to enli&s;t our women as &s;oldiers; and we reque&s;t it may be remembered, that we only contend for the <HI>capability</HI> of the female mind to become po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of any attainment within the reach of <HI>ma&s;culine exertion.</HI> We have produced our witne&s;&s;es; their dep|o&s;itions have been heard; the cau&s;e is before the pub|lic; we await their verdict; and, as we entertain all po&s;&s;ible veneration for the re&s;pectable jury, we &s;hall not dare to appeal from their deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>But while we do homage to the women of other times, we feel happy that nature is no le&s;s bountiful to the females of the pre&s;ent day.

Yet, in many in&s;tances, fame

has already lifted her immortalizing trump. Madame de Genlis has added new effulgence to the literary an|nals of France. This lady unites, in an a&s;toni&s;hing degree, both genius and application! May her inde|fatigable exertions be crowned with the &s;ucce&s;s they &s;o richly merit&mdash;May no illiberal prejudices ob&s;truct the progre&s;s of her multiplied productions; but, borne along the &s;tream of time, may they continue plea&s;ura|ble vehicles of in&s;truction, and confer on their inge|nious author that celebrity to which &s;he is indi&s;putably entitled. France may al&s;o ju&s;tly place among her li&s;t of illu&s;trious per&s;onages, the luminous name of Ro|land. Madame Roland compri&s;ed, in her own ener|getic and capacious mind, all tho&s;e appropriate vir|tues, which are characterized as ma&s;culine and femi|nine. She not only dignified THE SEX, but human nature in the aggregate; and her memory will be held in veneration, wherever talents, literature, patri|oti&s;m, and uniform heroi&s;m, are properly appreciated.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h I&s;le is at this moment di&s;tingui&s;hed by a con&s;tellation of the fir&s;t magnitude. Barbauld, Seward, Cowley, Inchbald, Burney, Smith, Radcliffe, Moore, Williams, Woll&s;tonecraft, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;the&s;e la|dies, celebrated for brilliancy of genius and literary attainments, have rendered yet more illu&s;trious the Engli&s;h name.</P>
<P>Nor is America de&s;titute of females, who&s;e abilities and improvements give them an indi&s;putable claim to immortality. It is a fact, e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond all con|trover&s;y, that we are indebted for the di&s;covery of our country, to female enterprize, deci&s;ion, and genero&s;ity. The great Columbus, after having in vain &s;olicited the aid of Genoa, France, England, Portugal, and Spain&mdash;after having combated, for a period of eight years, with every objection that a want of knowledge could propo&s;e, found, at la&s;t, his only re&s;ource in the pene|tration and magnanimity of I&s;abella of Spain, who furni&s;hed the equipment, and rai&s;ed the &s;ums nece&s;&s;ary to defray the expen&s;es, on the &s;ale of her own jewels; and while we conceive an action, &s;o honourable to
<PB N="219" REF="034162_0885_0FFC5C44E37D4FD8">
THE SEX, hath not been &s;ufficiently applauded, we tru&s;t, that the equality of the female intellect to that of their brethren, who have &s;o long u&s;urped an un|manly and unfounded &s;uperiority, will never, in this younger world, be left without a witne&s;s. We cannot a&s;certain the number of ingenious women, who at pre&s;ent adorn our country. In the &s;hade of &s;olitude they perhaps cultivate their own minds, and &s;uperin|tend the education of their children. Our day, we know, is only dawning&mdash;But when we contemplate a Warren, a Philenia, an Antonia, a Euphelia, &amp;c. &amp;c. we gratefully acknowledge, that genius and applica|tion, even in the female line, already gild, with efful|gent radiance, our ble&s;t Aurora.</P>
<P>But women are calculated to &s;hine in other charac|ters than tho&s;e adverted to, in the preceding E&s;&s;ays; and with proper attention to their education, and &s;ub|&s;equent habits, they might ea&s;ily attain that independ|ence, for which a Woll&s;tonecraft hath &s;o energetically contended; the term, <HI>helple&s;s widow,</HI> might be ren|dered as unfrequent and inapplicable as that of <HI>help|le&s;s widower;</HI> and although we &s;hould undoubtedly continue to mourn the di&s;&s;olution of wedded amity, yet we &s;hould derive con&s;olation from the knowledge, that the infant train had &s;till a remaining prop, and that a mother could <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t</HI> as well as <HI>weep</HI> over her offspring.</P>
<P>That women have a talent&mdash;a talent which, duly cultivated, would confer that independence, which is demon&s;trably of incalculable utility, every attentive ob&s;erver will confe&s;s. THE SEX &s;hould be taught to depend on their own efforts, for the procurement of an e&s;tabli&s;hment in life. The chance of a matrimonial coadjutor, is no more than a probable contingency; and if they were early accu&s;tomed to regard this <HI>un|certain</HI> event with &s;uitable <HI>indifference,</HI> they would make elections with that deliberation, which would be calcu|lated to give a more rational pro&s;pect of tranquillity. All this we have repeatedly a&s;&s;erted, and all this we do invariably believe. To neglect poli&s;hing a gem, or

ob&s;tinately to refu&s;e bringing into action a trea&s;ure in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when we might thus accumulate a hand|&s;ome intere&s;t, is &s;urely egregiou&s;ly ab&s;urd, and the height of folly. The <HI>united efforts of male and female</HI> might re&s;cue many a family from de&s;truction, which, notwith|&s;tanding the efforts of its <HI>individual</HI> head, is now in|volved in all the calamities attendant on a di&s;&s;ipated fortune and augmenting debts. It is not po&s;&s;ible to educate children in a manner which will render them <HI>too beneficial</HI> to &s;ociety; and the more we multiply aids to a family, the greater will be the &s;ecurity, that its individuals will not be thrown a burden on the public.</P>
<P>An in&s;tance of <HI>female capability,</HI> this moment occurs to memory. In the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in a &s;mall town, &s;ome miles from the metropolis, re&s;ides a wo|man, who hath made a&s;toni&s;hing improvements in ag|riculture. Her mind, in the early part of her life, was but penuriou&s;ly cultivated, and &s;he grew up al|mo&s;t wholly uneducated: But being &s;uffered, during her childhood, to rove at large among her native fields, her limbs expanded, and &s;he acquired a height of &s;tature above the common &s;ize; her mind al&s;o became invigorated; and her under&s;tanding &s;natched &s;ufficient information, to produce a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the injury &s;he &s;u&s;tained in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he want of tho&s;e aids, which &s;hould have been furni&s;hed in the beginning of her years.

She read every thing &s;he could procure; but the impre&s;&s;ions adventitiou&s;ly made on her infant mind &s;till obtained the a&s;cendency. A few rough acres con&s;tituted her patrimonial inherit|ance; the&s;e &s;he has brought into a &s;tate of high cul|tivation; their productions are every year both u&s;eful and ornamental; &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of agricolation, and is at once a botani&s;t and a flori&s;t. The mo&s;t approved authors in the Engli&s;h language, on the&s;e &s;ubjects, are in her hands, and &s;he &s;tudies them with indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

She has obtained &s;uch a con&s;iderable knowledge in the nature of &s;oils, the preci&s;e manure which they re|quire, and their particular adaption to the various fruits of the earth, that &s;he is become the oracle of all the farmers in her vicinity; and when laying out, or appropriating their grounds, they uniformly &s;ubmit them to her in&s;pection. Her gardens are the re&s;ort of all &s;trangers who happen to vi&s;it her village; and &s;he is particularly remarkable for a growth of trees, from which, gentlemen, &s;olicitous to enrich their fruit-gardens, or ornament their parterres, are in the habit of &s;upplying them&s;elves; and tho&s;e trees are, to their ingenious cultivator, a con&s;iderable income. Carefully attentive to her nur&s;ery, &s;he knows when to tran&s;plant, and when to prune; and &s;he perfectly under&s;tands the various methods of inoculating and ingrafting. In &s;hort, &s;he is a complete <HI>hu&s;bandwoman;</HI> and &s;he has, be&s;ides, acquired a va&s;t &s;tock of general knowledge, while her judgment has attained &s;uch a degree of ma|turity, as to ju&s;tify the confidence of the villagers, who are accu&s;tomed to con&s;ult her on every perplexing emergency.</P>
<P>In the con&s;tant u&s;e of exerci&s;e, &s;he is not corpulent; and &s;he is extremely active, and wonderfully athletic. In&s;tances, almo&s;t incredible, are produced of her &s;trength. Indeed, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;he is the idol and &s;tanding theme of the village, &s;ince, with all her uncommon qualifications, &s;he combines a tender|ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition not to be exceeded. Her exten&s;ive acquaintance with herbs, contributes to render her a &s;kilful and truly valuable nur&s;e; and the world never produced a more affectionate, attentive, or faithful woman: Yet, while &s;he feelingly &s;ympathizes with every invalid, &s;he is not her&s;elf &s;ubject to imaginary complaints; nor does &s;he ea&s;ily yield to real illne&s;s.

good offices, after &s;oftly clo&s;ing the &s;hutters and door of her apartment, privately &s;ummoned the aid of a phy&s;ician; and when the medical gentleman made his appearance, &s;he accompanied him to the apartment of her friend; but behold, the bird was flown! and when pur&s;ued, &s;he was found at a di&s;tance from her habita|tion, directing &s;ome labourers, who were employed in her &s;ervice, and who, &s;he was fearful, were not &s;uffi|ciently attentive to her previous in&s;tructions. The event proved &s;he had acted judiciou&s;ly; for, braced by the fre&s;h air, her nerves new &s;trung, a&s;&s;umed their u&s;ual tone, her &s;ickne&s;s vani&s;hed, and her native vig|our returned.</P>
<P>Although far advanced in years, without a matri|monial connexion, yet, con&s;tantly engaged in u&s;eful and intere&s;ting pur&s;uits, &s;he manife&s;ts not that peevi&s;h|ne&s;s and di&s;content, &s;o frequently attendant on <HI>old maids;</HI> &s;he realizes all that independence which is proper to humanity; and &s;he knows how to &s;et a ju&s;t value on the ble&s;&s;ings &s;he enjoys.</P>
<P>From my trea&s;ury of facts, I produce a &s;econd in|&s;tance, equally in point. I have &s;een letters, written by a lady, an inhabitant of St. Seba&s;tian, (a Spani&s;h emporium) that breathed the true &s;pirit of commerce, and evinced the writer to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the integrity, punctuality and di&s;patch, which are &s;uch capital requi|&s;ites in the mercantile career. This lady is at the head of a firm, of which her&s;elf and daughters make up the individuals&mdash;Her name is <HI>Birmingham.</HI> She is, I imagine, well known to the commercial part of the United States. She was left a widow in the infancy of her children, who were numerous; and &s;he imme|diately adopted the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures for their emolument. Being a woman of a magnanimous mind, &s;he devoted her &s;ons to the profe&s;&s;ion of arms; and they were expeditiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed of, in a way the be&s;t calculated to bring them acquainted with the art of war. Her daughters were educated for bu&s;ine&s;s; and, arriving at womanhood, they have long &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves into a capital trading-hou&s;e, of

which, as has been ob&s;erved, their re&s;pectable mother is the head. She is, in the hours of bu&s;ine&s;s, invaria|bly to be found in her compting-hou&s;e; there &s;he takes her morning repa&s;t; her daughters act as clerks, (and they are adepts in their office) regularly prepar|ing the papers and letters, which pa&s;s in order under her in&s;pection. She &s;igns her&s;elf, in all accounts and letters, <HI>Widow Birmingham;</HI> and this is the addre&s;s by which &s;he is de&s;ignated. I have conver&s;ed with one of our captains, who has often negociated with her the di&s;po&s;al of large and valuable cargoes. Her con&s;ignments, I am told, are to a great amount; and one of the principal merchants in the town of Bo&s;ton a&s;&s;erts, that he receives from no hou&s;e in Eu|rope more &s;atisfactory returns. Upright in their deal|ings, and unwearied in their application, the&s;e ladies po&s;&s;e&s;s a right to pro&s;perity; and we tru&s;t that their circum&s;tances are as ea&s;y, as their conduct is meri|torious.</P>
<P>"Would you, good Mr. Gleaner, &s;tation us in the compting-hou&s;e?" No, my fair country-women, ex|cept circum&s;tances unavoidably pointed the way.

<P>IT was on a &s;erene evening, ju&s;t as the empre&s;s of night commenced her mild career, that Adolphus with folded arms, and a heart on which was impre&s;&s;ed

the mo&s;t lively traits of devotional gratitude, paced and repaced the &s;ea girt &s;trand of a wealthy emporium, whither he had been carried by the hope of commer|cial advantage: His bo&s;om was tranquillized by the el|igibility of his then &s;ituation; and the &s;unny beams of pro&s;perity had invigorated all tho&s;e gay expectations that, &s;hrinking from the clouds of adver&s;ity, pro&s;trate before the &s;torms of life. A &s;hip, the property of A|dolphus, had a few hours before ca&s;t anchor in the &s;tream&mdash;the &s;hore re&s;ounded the cheerful voices of the mariners, and the da&s;hing of the waves vibrated gratefully on his ear.</P>
<P>Yet the chalice of misfortune had been mixed for A|dolphus; recently he had ta&s;ted the bitter draught, and it was to the humane interpo&s;ition of &s;trangers that he was indebted for e&s;caping the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;wallowing the very dregs. Shipwrecked on a foreign &s;hore&mdash;to|tally unknown, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing not a &s;hilling of proper|ty. He had at this de&s;olate period experienced the utmo&s;t energies of philanthropy, and the efforts of be|nevolence had not only extricated him from that ruin which his circum&s;tances &s;eemed inevitably to involve, but, admini&s;tering liberally to his nece&s;&s;ities, had pro|cured him eligible accommodations and returned him in &s;afety to his native country. "And oh! exclaimed Adolphus, may I never cea&s;e to acknowledge the va&s;t ar|rearage, by &s;uccouring to the utmo&s;t of my power every &s;on and daughter of misfortune; and when I &s;hall for|get to extend to the haple&s;s &s;tranger, who&s;e right is in|&s;cribed by adver&s;ity, a portion of my regards, may I be dead to the plea&s;ures of exi&s;tence, and may the grate|ful &s;well of complacency no more expand my bo&s;om.

Ju&s;t at this moment, a barge, launching from the &s;hore, was on the point of proceeding to the &s;hip. Adol|phus hailed the bargemen, and leaping on board, the well plied oar &s;oon produced him be&s;ide the Atalanta. Entering the &s;hip, he contemplated for a moment the &s;plendors of a &s;uperb evening, with the additional ad|vantages of a beautifully exten&s;ive water pro&s;pect. The moon &s;hone forth in full orbed maje&s;ty, and he was indulging a mo&s;t delightful reverie, when his attention was &s;uddenly arre&s;ted by an agonizing &s;hriek i&s;&s;uing from the cabin, the accent of which was evidently fem|inine. In&s;tantly he de&s;cended the &s;tairs, when an el|egant and intere&s;ting woman, on who&s;e features was impre&s;&s;ed the frenzy of de&s;pair, wringing her &s;nowy hands, in a tone of the deepe&s;t angui&s;h, exclaimed, "<HI>My God, it is impo&s;&s;ible! &s;urely it is impo&s;&s;ible</HI>&mdash;<HI>&s;ome vil|lain has ba&s;ely traduced him!</HI>" Again &s;he &s;hrieked aloud, when, rai&s;ing her eyes with a fearful kind of horror, and ob&s;erving numbers gather about her, &s;he cla&s;ped her hands in evident terror, and her calamitous reflections for a time defeating them&s;elves, &s;he would have &s;unk lifele&s;s on the floor, had not the attentive Adolphus received her in his arms.</P>
<P>Under his humane direction, every nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep was taken for her recovery; and &s;he too &s;oon opened her eyes on a world in which her peace had been cru|elly wrecked. During her &s;u&s;pended animation, he had learned that the immediate cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s proceeded from a verbal me&s;&s;age, containing much ap|parent ingratitude, delivered to her in the name of a per|&s;on from whom &s;he expected protection, and who &s;he had informed by letter of her arrival. And, with the hope of implanting that confidence which he judged nece&s;&s;ary for her &s;ituation, he informed her that he him&s;elf having been a &s;on of &s;orrow, his &s;ympathy was the offspring of experience; that the &s;hip and cargo was his property, and that being largely in arrearage to the unfortunate, if &s;he ranked in that truly re&s;pectable de&s;cription, he was ready to di&s;charge his debt to her in whatever mode might be&s;t corre&s;pond with her wi&s;hes.</P>

A&s;toni&s;hment &s;eemed to arre&s;t, in the countenance of the lady, the progre&s;s of grief; but a&s;&s;uming an air of dignified compo&s;ure, &s;he replied: "You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, Sir, that your addre&s;s is out of the common cour&s;e. Accept, however, my grateful thanks for what|ever of kindne&s;s it contains; and be a&s;&s;ured that my di&s;|tre&s;&s;es are not of a <HI>pecuniary</HI> nature; it is not in your power, Sir, to relieve me. God forbid that in a ca&s;e of &s;o delicate a nature, I &s;hould &s;tand in need of foreign in|terpo&s;ition. Unfortunately I have had too many wit|ne&s;&s;es of a &s;orrow which is perhaps occa&s;ioned by a blameable &s;u&s;ceptibility. Tho&s;e about you can inform you that a mi&s;under&s;tanding hath taken place between my hu&s;band and my&s;elf; but all will, all mu&s;t end well. I have been wrong to be &s;o much di&s;quieted, and that &s;ympathy which you mention, induced by polite|ne&s;s, will undoubtedly apologize for me, if I &s;ay that I have need of &s;olitude to collect my &s;cattered &s;pirits." Adolphus, after a&s;&s;uring the beautiful unknown that if her future exigencies demanded the extricating hand of a friend, her recognition of him would confer a plea&s;|ing obligation, drew from his pocket-his addre&s;s, and placing it in the hands of her woman, bowed re&s;pect|fully, and, quitting the cabin, took with him tho&s;e ob|&s;ervers whom her apparent &s;ufferings had drawn thith|er. Several days revolved, and he continued ignorant of the fate of the lady; for reflecting on the elevated &s;olemnity with which &s;he replied to his proffered aid, he conceived him&s;elf obliged in honour to de&s;i&s;t from further inquiries. At length, however, the following letter was put into his hand:</P>

<P>A GOOD countenance is indeed a letter of recom|mendation&mdash;and that benignity which irradiated your features, when, on the fatal evening of the 1&s;t in&s;tant, you took &s;uch an apparent intere&s;t in the poor unfor|tunate, who then evidently excited your commi&s;era|tion, is my &s;ecurity for your continued favour. Alas! for me, that I am reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of a reliance

on one to who&s;e very name, but for my wretched &s;itu|ation, I had remained a &s;tranger. Yet it is fit you &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a few leading particulars, relative to the per&s;on who now earne&s;tly &s;olicits your protection. Take then, worthy Sir, in few words, the outlines of a life until within the&s;e two pa&s;t years, mark|ed only by obedience, and con&s;equent tranquillity.</P>
<P>My family name is&mdash;, I was born in the capital of Scotland&mdash;my father then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and &s;till con|tinues to fill, an eligible and lucrative public employ|ment&mdash;my mother died at a period when, hu&s;hed in the cradle of innocence, I was in&s;en&s;ible to every pain or plea&s;ure, not originating in my immediate wants, and her place was &s;o well filled by her &s;ucce&s;&s;or as to leave my opening rea&s;on only natural regrets for this event. The attachment of my parents was apparent|ly equal, and I was ble&s;t by every proper indulgence. Born in affluence, I early received every advantage of which my tender years was &s;u&s;ceptible. The impor|tant era of &s;ixteen found me at a celebrated boarding &s;chool, where the ill judged liberties allowed to young ladies too often lay the foundation of misfortunes that terminate not but with their mortal exi&s;tence. It was during my continuance at this &s;eminary, that I &s;aw and loved the too in&s;inuating Seba&s;tian; his addre&s;s is ea&s;y, his figure manly, and the whole contour of his per&s;on &s;trikingly impre&s;&s;ive. He made his advances with well di&s;&s;embled delicacy; his ardent prote&s;tations of inviolable love were cloathed in the habiliments of friend&s;hip; and when at la&s;t his language became more deci&s;ive, prepared for a declaration that I wi&s;hed, I re|ceived the avowal of his tender attachment with all tho&s;e demon&s;trations of complacency which youthful &s;incerity &s;ugge&s;t, and which virgin mode&s;ty he&s;itates not to authorize. Satisfied of the fervour of my own regard, I calculated on a mutual pa&s;&s;ion, and my lov|er po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my unbounded confidence. Fatal delu|&s;ion! Wretched e&s;&s;erve&s;cence of fancy&mdash;ye have mi&s;|erably undone me; and, &s;trange to tell, I live to lament the folly of my too ea&s;y faith.</P>

You will ob&s;erve, Sir, that my path was plain before me, and Seba&s;tian was immediately referred to my father. But what was my a&s;toni&s;hment when that father, ever attentive to my be&s;t intere&s;t, utterly refu&s;ed to &s;anction my choice, po&s;itively interdicting all future intercour&s;e with Seba&s;tian, and making my continu|ance at the &s;eminary to depend wholly on my obedi|ence to his commands. Ah, why did he tru&s;t to the di&s;cretion of a giddy love-&s;ick girl. I betrayed his hone&s;t confidence; and ea&s;ily finding opportunities of conver&s;ing with the &s;educer, the re&s;ult of our frequent meetings was a clande&s;tine marriage; but no &s;ooner had I become a wife, than all the daughter ru&s;hed on my &s;oul. I fondly loved, revered, and next to adored my father; and it was the cheri&s;hed hope of obtain|ing a reconciliation that gave me courage, in the face of a &s;olemn prohibition, to commit an offence that alas! has thrown me out of his protection, and which has, I have every rea&s;on to fear, bani&s;hed me forever from his affections! Every method hath been pur&s;ued, both by Seba&s;tian and my&s;elf, which we judged might ob|tain our pardon; but our conciliatory attempts have proved ineffectual. Prayers and expo&s;tulations have been in vain&mdash;my father, my beloved father continues inexorable! Since the declaration of my marriage, I have never once beheld his benign countenance. My mother, my brothers, and my &s;i&s;ters, alas! his pro|hibition extends to them al&s;o! He refu&s;es to receive my letters; and, when in the perturbation of my &s;oul I &s;till pre&s;&s;ed them upon him, they were repeatedly re|turned unopened, and no language can de&s;cribe the con&s;equent angui&s;h of my &s;pirit.</P>
<P>During my &s;upplications for a reconciliation, the at|tention and unrivalled tenderne&s;s of my hu&s;band con|tinued unremitted; but at its clo&s;e I &s;aw, or thought I &s;aw a vi&s;ible abatement of his kindne&s;s! I was, how|ever, willing to place this circum&s;tance to a natural cau&s;e; and, &s;olicitous to believe what was &s;o intimately connected with my <HI>tranquillity,</HI> I per&s;uaded my&s;elf that he only took rank with the generality of married men.
<PB N="230" REF="034162_0896_0FFC5C1DC6E06428">
It was at this juncture that the decline of my health made it nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould take lodgings at Bath, while bu&s;ine&s;s detaining Seba&s;tian in London, a temporary &s;eparation &s;eemed unavoidable; and I &s;truggled to em|brace that compo&s;ure which &s;he who hath &s;werved capitally from the path of duty will find it very dif|ficult to regain.</P>
<P>Thus was I circum&s;tanced, when a letter was brought me from Seba&s;tian, acquainting me that he was on the point of embarking for America; that very advantageous propo&s;als had been made him, the emol|ument of which depended on his immediate clo&s;ing therewith, and on his collecting together every &s;hilling of property he could command. He entreated me therefore to think favourably of him, and the &s;tep he meditated, and to &s;end him as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible every thing of value that I could conveniently part with. He informed me that he contemplated an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in P&mdash;; and that on a &s;uppo&s;ition, my health and inclination would meet his wi&s;hes, he had made arrangements for my pa&s;&s;age to the new world, on board the Atalanta, which &s;hip was to &s;ail in one month after his embarkation. The letter containing this unexpected intelligence, was replete with expre&s;&s;ions of unalterable attachment; and I, who entertained no doubt of my hu&s;band's honour, never regarded their &s;incerity as que&s;tionable. The little intere&s;t in my gift was cheerfully &s;urrendered&mdash;my rings, my jewels of every de&s;cription, every thing that could be turned into ready money, were all tran&s;mitted to the metrop|olis; and I only re&s;erved my watch, the value of which was enhanced by having been the property of my mother.</P>
<P>With a degree of alacrity, a&s;toni&s;hing even to my&s;elf, I &s;et about preparing to follow; and I in reality ex|perienced a degree of &s;atisfaction in the idea of quitting tho&s;e dear native &s;hores, where I was con&s;idered as an alien to tho&s;e per&s;ons whom I &s;hall never cea&s;e to re|vere, and for whom the &s;igh of my bo&s;om &s;till aro&s;e. I left England with tho&s;e kind of feelings natural to a

daughter and a wife thus circum&s;tanced: But every difficulty was lightened, by the pro&s;pect of finding my|&s;elf, at the clo&s;e of my voyage, under the protection of the man to whom my heart was mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately de|voted. I flattered my&s;elf that, &s;trangers in this new world, our con&s;equence to each other would nece&s;&s;ari|ly augment; and the halcyon days of mutual love and confidence pa&s;&s;ed in vi&s;ion before me.</P>
<P>With the fir&s;t po&s;&s;ible moment after my arrival, I di&s;patched a line of intelligence to Seba&s;tian, and I re|ceived, by way of an&s;wer, a <HI>verbal declaration, that ex|cept I could procure a reconciliation with my father, I mu&s;t never more expect to &s;ee his face!!!</HI> You, Sir, witne&s;&s;ed the effect of this a&s;toni&s;hing annunciation. Yet, after the fir&s;t ebullition of grief and &s;urpri&s;e had a little &s;ub|&s;ided, I per&s;uaded my&s;elf that it had been worded dur|ing a moment of in&s;anity; and I thought it became my character to &s;eek an eclairci&s;&s;ement. Obliged as I was by your proffered a&s;&s;i&s;tance, my &s;pirit was not then &s;ufficiently broken to &s;ubmit with compo&s;ure to my hu|miliating &s;ituation, and I am fearful that I received your unmerited attentions with undue haughtine&s;s; but that delicacy a&s;cribed to your character, will, I tru&s;t, enable you to account for my feelings. From the hour of my debarkation I have a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;ought my hu&s;band, but he as &s;tudiou&s;ly avoids me&mdash;we have not yet met. I have repeatedly addre&s;&s;ed him by letter&mdash;I have expo&s;tulated, &s;oothed, and entreated, but without effect&mdash;his an&s;wers are all in one peremp|tory &s;tyle&mdash;he will never again &s;ee me, except my father explicitly approbates our union. My father's admea&s;|urement of the mind of this barbarou&s;ly mercenary man, was, it appears, perfectly ju&s;t. Repeatedly did the anxious parent a&s;&s;ure me that his only object in &s;eeking an alliance with me, was that fortune which he vainly imagined could not be withheld from me. Alas! alas! at this fearful moment, dreadfully do I realize the truth of this &s;entiment! Seba&s;tian has left this city, and is, I am informed, gone on a party of plea&s;ure to L&mdash;. Thither I would pur&s;ue him. Could I once more &s;ee

</LETTER>
<P>Adolphus ha&s;tened on the fleete&s;t wings of philan|thropy&mdash;every thing the injured Henrietta had re|que&s;ted was exactly attended to. He &s;peedily di&s;|patched a letter to his lady, recounting every par|ticular; and the gentle Anna delayed not to addre&s;s the fair mourner in tho&s;e &s;oothing &s;trains of con&s;ola|tion, which an elegant female knows to &s;elect, and which, penned by the hand of tender pity, po&s;&s;e&s;s an a&s;&s;ua&s;ive influence, calculated to blunt the edge of the
<PB N="233" REF="034162_0899_0FFC5C11C9A1F140">
mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive grief. She a&s;&s;ured Henrietta that a more welcome gue&s;t could not pa&s;s her thre&s;hold; and &s;he urged her immediately to fly to an abode, the val|ue of which would be enhanced by her pre&s;ence. Adol|phus having accompli&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s that detained him, conducted Henrietta to L&mdash;, where &s;he was re|ceived by his amiable companion, in a manner exactly an&s;werable to his wi&s;hes. A &s;eries of delicate attentions were uniformly embodied, and no effort was wanting, which it was judged might le&s;&s;en the chagrin of the un|fortunate &s;tranger. Seba&s;tian, however, continuing to elude her pur&s;uit, &s;he at length became convinced of his unworthine&s;s; and every ve&s;tige of e&s;teem being up|rooted from her bo&s;om, the tender pa&s;&s;ion in a mind corrected by misfortunes, of cour&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, and &s;he had no remaining wi&s;h but that re&s;toration to her fami|ly which pardon and reconciliation could alone procure.</P>
<P>Adolphus meditated a voyage to England, and the wi&s;hes of Henrietta accelerated his purpo&s;e. Arrived on the Albion &s;hore, he procured an introduction to a confidential friend of the father of Henrietta. This friend was in the commercial line, and Adolphus be|came his cu&s;tomer. He made it the intere&s;t of a per|&s;on &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his views, to vi&s;it him at his lodg|ings; and in the cour&s;e of a conver&s;ation contrived on purpo&s;e, he, as if by accident, mentioned Mr.&mdash;; in|quiries relative to his family &s;ucceeded. "How many daughters has Mr.&mdash;, Sir? Is Mi&s;s Eliza his elde&s;t daughter?" "Alas! no&mdash;his elde&s;t daughter is a &s;ource of much anxiety to her father.&mdash;Offending him by an ill-judged marriage, he was for a time inplaca|ble&mdash;and the poor lady hath wandered, we hardly know whither. You &s;eem moved, Sir&mdash;&s;urely you are not acquainted with her &s;tory!&mdash;yet our la&s;t knowl|edge of the lovely fugitive, was her taking &s;hipping for America&mdash;and alas! without a protector! Your looks are expre&s;&s;ive, Sir&mdash;Have you any intelligence to communicate? Have you &s;een her&mdash;heard of her? Where can &s;he be found? Does &s;he live? Is &s;he hap|py? Speak, Sir! for God's &s;ake, &s;peak."</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="034162_0900_0FFC5C10440A9F48">
"I will, Sir, and with happine&s;s proportioned to your own. I left the lady at my hou&s;e in L&mdash;; &s;he was in health, and &s;he con&s;titutes the deare&s;t &s;olace which, during my ab&s;ence, remains to the partner of my heart." This was enough&mdash;the inquirer, ru&s;hing from the apartment, was immediately out of &s;ight; and, &s;peed|ing to the family of Henrietta, her kindred &s;oon throng|ed about the welcome me&s;&s;enger of peace&mdash;father, mother, brothers, &s;i&s;ters, alternately cla&s;ped him to their bo&s;oms&mdash;gra&s;ped his hands&mdash;poured fourth their glad ori&s;ons to Heaven, and invoked ble&s;&s;ings on the in&s;tru|ment of &s;uch immea&s;urable good. Now they eagerly que&s;tioned, and anon expre&s;&s;ed the unutterable emo|tion of the heart, by the big tears of pity, love, and gratitude; and their dete&s;tation of the villain Seba&s;|tian, was only equalled by their admiration of her hu|mane protector. Gladly would they have endowed him with the better part of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and the father of Henrietta, particularly, was unbounded in his demon&s;trations of the rapt enthu&s;ia&s;m of gratitude.</P>
<P>Adolphus returned to America, bearing the olive branch, enriched with the paternal benediction, and con|veying letters copiou&s;ly fraught with unre&s;erved love, returning confidence, and the mo&s;t unequivocal marks of an entire reconciliation. Reiterated invitations were al&s;o wafted over&mdash;&s;he was conjured to ble&s;s once more tho&s;e native haunts, to take &s;helter in that pater|nal abode, where, from the hour of her departure, peace had been a &s;tranger&mdash;and the comparatively happy Henrietta only delays her voyage to England, until &s;he can obtain from our Legi&s;lators a di&s;&s;olution of that contract into which &s;he &s;o indi&s;creetly entered, and which &s;he now &s;o deeply laments.</P>
<P>The Gleaner, while engaged in the routine of office, hath collected the foregoing <HI>well authenticated narrative,</HI> and he imagines it will intere&s;t the reader. The intelli|gent mind will deduce therefrom a le&s;&s;on. It furni&s;h|es another in&s;tance of the misfortunes attendant on a connexion un&s;anctioned by duty, of the propriety of obedience, and of the tran&s;ient duration of love, un&s;up|ported by e&s;teem.</P>

<P>WHEN I do not deeply commi&s;erate the un|happy debtor, in who&s;e bo&s;om probity and punctuality are inmates, I &s;hall be utterly lo&s;t to every recollection of the various calamities to which my &s;pecies are &s;ubjected. I do not &s;ay that the cred|itor has not cau&s;e of complaint; he either loaned his property from motives of friend&s;hip, or he parted with it, indulging an expectation, that it would accumulate an intere&s;t which would &s;till augment his &s;tores; and, if he cannot be charged with extortion, the tran&s;action was undoubtedly ju&s;tifiable: In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, to de&s;poil him of that which was legally his own, is a di&s;appointment on which he did not calculate, and which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as injurious.</P>
<P>Yet if the creditor is in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, and the man in whom he confided is the victim of misfortunes neither to be fore&s;een nor prevented; if it is notorious that he has ever been upright and open in his dealings; if he continued, to the utmo&s;t verge of po&s;&s;ibility, punctual in his payments&mdash;What then?&mdash;Why then I declare, I regard a creditor thus connected and thus circum&s;tanced, as in a very enviable &s;ituation. To every benevolent mind, ambitious of accumulating good and proper actions, my rea&s;on will be obvious. He is hereby furni&s;hed with an opportunity of calling into exerci&s;e the noble&s;t faculties which dignify human nature: It is at his option to embody the virtues&mdash;he
<PB N="236" REF="034162_0902_0FFC5C0D0B180AC8">
can pour into the wounded bo&s;om of the &s;orrow worn &s;ufferer, the healing balm of con&s;olation&mdash;he may even imitate Deity&mdash;he can forgive like that God who dealeth liberally, and upbraideth not.</P>
<P>Behold the oppre&s;&s;ed man&mdash;he is bowed down by calamity&mdash;his heart is fa&s;hioned by rectitude&mdash;it is the &s;anctuary for every hone&s;t principle&mdash;but his be&s;t con|certed efforts have proved abortive&mdash;misfortunes have i&s;&s;ued as a torrent, and they have deluged his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations! With folded arms, contracted brow, and features, on which is imprinted the deepe&s;t angui&s;h, he occupies his &s;eat in that apartment where triumphed every refined and virtuous enjoyment, but from which, alas! the face of plea&s;ure &s;eems now forever bani&s;hed! His gentle, his &s;ympathizing com|panion&mdash;but, &s;trange to tell, her power to &s;oothe is no more!&mdash;"Dear &s;ource of dome&s;tic happine&s;s," he exclaims, "I have undone thee; thy manifold virtues but point the drawn dagger to my &s;oul&mdash;every earthly ble&s;&s;ing &s;hould be thine&mdash;but he, in whom thou ha&s;t placed thy unbounded confidence, hath mi&s;erably failed thee. Ruin hath overtaken me&mdash;impri&s;onment awaits&mdash;and for thee and thy dear infants, where, amid this wide unpitying world, will ye find a place of &s;helter! Gracious Heaven! reflection harrows up my &s;oul; and I tremble on the verge of di&s;traction! God of compa&s;&s;ion, vouch&s;afe to be&s;tow thy con&s;olations on the&s;e de&s;olate children of adver&s;ity, and calm tho&s;e &s;orrows which it is beyond the reach of human wi&s;dom to a&s;&s;uage." The afflicted fair one cla&s;ps her hands in &s;peechle&s;s agony&mdash;her eyes are rai&s;ed to heaven&mdash;&s;he is bathed in tears&mdash;and her inarticulated mi&s;eries affect beyond de&s;cription: The affrighted children clu&s;ter round&mdash;they cannot develop the &s;ource of her &s;ufferings, but they behold her exqui&s;itely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed&mdash;their little hearts are attuned to &s;ympathy, and they mingle their infantile cries. With a wild air &s;he pre&s;&s;es them alternately to her bo&s;om&mdash;&s;he pours forth the maternal benediction, and it is conceived in all the
<PB N="237" REF="034162_0903_0FFC5C0695032E50">
energy of &s;orrow, while a more deeply agonizing &s;cene can hardly be imagined!</P>
<P>Well, Sir, he owes you many thou&s;ands&mdash;granted&mdash;but has he &s;quandered tho&s;e thou&s;ands in unwarrant|able indulgencies? Has he not been judicious in his plans; indu&s;trious in the pro&s;ecution of his bu&s;ine&s;s; and frugal in his expenditures? and is not this melan|choly cata&s;trophe produced by events wholly beyond his juri&s;diction? Be&s;ides, &s;hould you take the only &s;tep which can heighten his &s;ufferings&mdash;&s;hould you arre&s;t and throw him into pri&s;on&mdash;will this pay your debt? will it not rather put it wholly out of his power to make tho&s;e di&s;bur&s;ements which we acknowledge are your due?</P>
<P>See that door&mdash;it is more than half open; for tho&s;e victims of calamity are not &s;olicitous to elude the pur&s;uit of ju&s;tice, or to hide from the ear of curio&s;ity what they cannot conceal from them&s;elves. For the love of Heaven, dear good Sir, &s;tep home; Borne on the wings of benevolence, you will not be long, and prepare a writing which &s;hall remit the debt until the time when a more favourable turn in his affairs may enable him to di&s;charge your demands; and &s;uffer me to entreat, to conjure you, by that Godlike benev|olence which is at this moment originating in your bo&s;om the noble&s;t purpo&s;es, to give the heavenly ema|nation way&mdash;to continue to aid his future efforts&mdash;to a&s;&s;i&s;t in building him up; and, in addition to the divine expan&s;ion which you will thus indulge, you may yet receive more than an equivalent for every benign exertion.</P>
<P>But di&s;cretion whi&s;pers that you are primarily to &s;tudy your own convenience, and not imprudently place that property beyond your reach, which your own exigencies may claim. This argument has weight; and if, my dear Sir, there are not expen&s;es you are in the habit of allowing, from which you can, in a &s;mall degree, deduct, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as unan&s;werable. Suppo&s;e, for example, you were to le&s;&s;en the number of bumpers you &s;wallow in the cour&s;e of a day; wine,
<PB N="238" REF="034162_0915_0FFC5BD7ED50C4E0">
drank in &s;mall quantities, operates as a cordial to the languid &s;pirit&mdash;it is a noble re&s;torative, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing even medicinal powers; but a too frequent and copious u&s;e thereof, de&s;troys its effect; and in the voluptuous embraces of familiarity its virtues expire. Is not the angel pity an inhabitant in the gentle bo&s;om of your lady? doth not &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s that charming benignity which &s;hould ever &s;tand con&s;picuous in the female character? and are there no articles in her department which &s;he can retrench? Do you go three times a week to the theatre? go but once, and appropriate the four dollars you thus re&s;cue to the nece&s;&s;ities of this poor bankrupt; and I dare pronounce that the entertainment you receive at the play-hou&s;e will po&s;|&s;e&s;s augmented charms. In general, it is true, that the infrequency of enjoyments enhance their value, but the plea&s;ures of benevolence never create &s;atiety. A repetition of virtuous actions becomes &s;till more productive of the mo&s;t refined, delightful and elevating &s;en&s;ations; and the rea&s;on is obvious, their origin is cele&s;tial; they will bloom immortal in the Paradi&s;e of our God.</P>
<P>Well, then, my good Sir, under the au&s;pices of the&s;e deductions and regulations, even economy enli&s;ts on the &s;ide of philanthropy.&mdash;Ble&s;s me! how expe|ditiou&s;ly you have prepared your articles of enlarge|ment!&mdash;But let us not delay&mdash;the door, as I &s;aid, is more than half open, and we will enter together&mdash;The paper is pre&s;ented&mdash;it is &s;eized with a trembling hand&mdash;its contents are read aloud&mdash;Gracious Heaven! what an a&s;toni&s;hing tran&s;ition! But let me briefly &s;ketch its effects. A &s;hock of electricity could not have been more in&s;tantaneous, or more general: The orient beam, &s;ucceeding to a night of darkne&s;s&mdash;No, this will not do&mdash;Reader, I have attempted too much&mdash;there are &s;cenes, over which a &s;kilful painter will drop the veil&mdash;Permit me to relinqui&s;h my de&s;ign&mdash;and let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that de&s;pair in one glad moment is con&s;igned to oblivion&mdash;that the expre&s;&s;ion of angui&s;h is no more&mdash;that the cherub, Hope, throws on every feature its all radiant beams&mdash;and the emancipated
<PB N="239" REF="034162_0904_0FFC5C028B1251F0">
man has now no &s;truggles but to evince his immea&s;ur|able &s;en&s;e of obligation, his con&s;equent gratitude, and the indefatigable zeal with which he will henceforward devote him&s;elf to the intere&s;t of his next to divine cred|itor. His lovely friend more than partakes his felicity; the &s;udden tide of joy &s;eems well near to overwhelm her gentle &s;pirit: The children cling around the knees of their common benefactor&mdash;intuitively they hail their guardian friend; and they will in future be taught to place his name next to that of Him, who is the alone proper object of religious wor&s;hip and adoration! Are there, this &s;ide the ely&s;ium of the ble&s;&s;ed, enjoyments more exqui&s;itely delightful, more truly elevating than tho&s;e which are to be obtained from the contemplation of &s;cenes like this? and, is it not true, that the charac|ter of him who is in the habit of producing them, ap|proximates, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, to the Author of every good?</P>
<P>The cruelty of impri&s;oning a man for debt, after he hath yielded the la&s;t farthing he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, appears to me in a very heinous point of view. It is amazing that there &s;hould be on this globe, nations who em|body in their code of civil regulations, a legal right to commit this great evil! That decree which ranks a man, merely becau&s;e he hath been unfortunate, with the malefactor who is convicted of capital enormities, is &s;urely dete&s;table, and every idea of rectitude mu&s;t revolt from its impo&s;itions. Liberty is too ine&s;timable a ble&s;&s;ing to be abridged, but in ca&s;es which involve offences of the deepe&s;t dye. <HI>If the in&s;olvent debtor has &s;ecreted his property, the ground is then changed</HI>&mdash;the affair wears another face&mdash;he becomes <HI>criminal,</HI> and mu&s;t fall into that cla&s;s of men, who&s;e degeneracy merits condign puni&s;hment. But if his actions are <HI>ir|reproachable,</HI> he is only <HI>unfortunate</HI>&mdash;he is entitled to the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s; and I would as &s;oon arre&s;t him becau&s;e he had laid in the grave the wife of his bo&s;om, or the children with who&s;e exi&s;tence his own &s;eemed in&s;eparably interwoven.</P>
<P>Travellers into the interior parts of our country, inform us there are many tribes and nations on which
<PB N="240" REF="034162_0905_0FFC5C0108A36918">

Li&s;tening to &s;uch recitals, they que&s;tion the veracity of the narrator, and when convinced by circum&s;tances of the real exi&s;tence of this barbarous trait, in the government of tho&s;e who term them&s;elves the civilized part of mankind&mdash;they, in their turn, become accu&s;ers; they evince the &s;trong|e&s;t marks of a&s;toni&s;hment, and horror; nor do they he&s;itate in charging the authors of &s;uch an injurious in&s;titution, with an utter dereliction of every &s;entiment proper to humanity.</P>
<P>A thought this moment occurs to my mind&mdash;Would it not be beneficial, was it made an act of the legi&s;|lature to appropriate public funds for the relief of the <HI>hone&s;t debtor?</HI> would not &s;uch a benevolent provi&s;ion be the be&s;t calculated to prevent fraud? and would it not &s;trikingly pourtray that true parental tenderne&s;s which ought to be a predominating feature in every government? Fir&s;t, it would prevent fraud; for no per&s;ons but tho&s;e who had <HI>demon&s;trably</HI> yielded up their la&s;t farthing, &s;hould be entitled to the benefit of the funds; and thus every &s;ufferer would <HI>become eager to deliver up the whole of his effects:</HI> and &s;econdly, it would be evincive of the parental tenderne&s;s of government, for it would hold out to its oppre&s;&s;ed children, that la&s;t re&s;ource, which would prevent their &s;hip-wrecked hopes from total de&s;truction: And it would be well to apportion the &s;ums appropriated, according to the
<PB N="241" REF="034162_0906_0FFC5BF72FCAB5F0">
merit, previous &s;ituation, and lo&s;&s;es of the &s;ufferer; if he had been embarked in enterpri&s;es calculated to <HI>promote the public weal&mdash;if his exertions had beautified a town or city&mdash;if he had &s;unk beneath the magnitude of an undertaking too arduous for his abilities</HI>&mdash;if his education had been liberal&mdash;his habits of living, generous&mdash;his &s;entiments refined, and his ideas capacious&mdash;if he had parted with a large property, without ju&s;tly incurring the imputation of extravagance: A man thus circum|&s;tanced &s;hould receive from the appropriated funds, according to the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature, propor|tionable a&s;&s;i&s;tance. If we are not mi&s;informed, the legi&s;lature of one of our &s;i&s;ter States, lately granted a lottery to a meritorious citizen who had been emi|nently unfortunate, for the purpo&s;e of paying tho&s;e ju&s;t debts, which, through a &s;eries of to him di&s;a&s;trous years, had enormou&s;ly accumulated, and which involv|ed, in their con&s;equences, many de&s;erving individuals. I would have purcha&s;ed a ticket in that lottery, although I had been &s;ure it would have proved a blank.</P>
<P>I think it impo&s;&s;ible to behold a de&s;erving man &s;ud|denly precipitated from an eminence which &s;eemed to be his birthright, and reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of ming|ling with tho&s;e pen&s;ioners of an hour, to whom cu&s;tom hath rendered their &s;ituation tolerable, without the &s;igh of regret, and the tear of commi&s;eration. What elegant building is that which rears its milk white front with mode&s;t dignity? the &s;urrounding pro&s;pects are truly picture&s;que; nothing can be imagined more paradi&s;iacally enchanting, more truly delightful. This well planned and well executed model of architecture, ri&s;es on an eminence which commands a hand&s;ome &s;treet; the views from the different wings of the building pre&s;ent a &s;ketch of both town and country; thus connecting, in idea, with its other advantages, tho&s;e &s;ocial plea&s;ures that con&s;titute the mo&s;t valuable enjoyments of life.</P>
<P>"Pray, has the per&s;on, who de&s;igned and reared this commodious man&s;ion, continued to occupy it

<P>A refugee, quitting her native country, during the late contention between England and her, then, colo|nies, obtained, after landing upon the Albion &s;hore, a commodious &s;ituation in the city of Bri&s;tol. She was a woman of ob&s;ervation, and, by con&s;equence, of in|formation; and her remarks on the manners and cu&s;|toms of the people, among which &s;he was &s;o unexpect|edly placed, were judicious, and worthy of that &s;olid|ity and penetration, which were con&s;picuous traits in her character. But, among the various ob&s;ervations &s;he was from time to time induced to make, no cir|cum&s;tance a&s;toni&s;hed her &s;o much, as the frugality and unremitted application of per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing property, which, in America, would have been judged a &s;uffi|cient foundation for the full indulgence of the appen|dages of luxury; And among other in&s;tances of this de&s;cription, which &s;he collected, &s;he often mentioned with admiration, a young woman, enjoying, in her own right, &s;everal thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which were ab&s;olutely at her own command, who, to her great &s;urpri&s;e, earne&s;tly &s;olicited the favour of being employed as her milliner.</P>
<P>Captain L&mdash;lately gratified me by a recital, for the truth of which he pledged that honour that hath never yet been forfeited. While he lay on the river

Thames, among the watermen who <HI>indu&s;triou&s;ly</HI> ply on that celebrated &s;tream, was a Mr. Swale, who di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf for his integrity, <HI>diligence,</HI> and punc|tuality. He was particularly attached to my friend, taking in his movements a decided intere&s;t, and di&s;|daining to avail him&s;elf of tho&s;e advantages, which youth and inexperience &s;eemed to have placed within his reach. His demands were never exorbitant; and he took care to guard our young adventurer again&s;t tho&s;e frauds, to which he might probably be &s;ubjected from per&s;ons le&s;s &s;crupulous. In &s;hort, the &s;ervices rendered by Mr. Swale were many and important; he was ever upon the wing to execute his wi&s;hes, and would ha&s;ten with alacrity on me&s;&s;ages of the mo&s;t in|&s;ignificant or trivial import. Neither the dre&s;s nor appearance of Mr. Swale varied e&s;&s;entially from the brethren of his order. He kept a kind of ordinary, whither the officers of tho&s;e &s;hips, laying in his vicin|ity, frequently repaired, for the purpo&s;e of taking tho&s;e occa&s;ional refre&s;hments that their exigencies required.</P>
<P>Captain L&mdash;was &s;urpri&s;ed to find Mr. Swale oft|en refu&s;ing, from tho&s;e to whom he profe&s;&s;ed an at|tachment, any compen&s;ation for the articles which he furni&s;hed; and his fears, that the man might eventu|ally become the victim of his own liberality, induced him to pre&s;s on him the full price for every repa&s;t he had taken in his ordinary. Mr. Swale was a general favourite with the American commanders, then lying on the river&mdash;there was &s;omething clever about the man&mdash;and his facetious good humour, with the cheer|ful alacrity with which he accommodated him&s;elf to their wi&s;hes, induced them frequently to &s;olicit his &s;o|ciety when they met at the ordinary. It was at one of tho&s;e unceremonious a&s;&s;ociations, that Captain L&mdash;expre&s;&s;ed to a comrade his regret, that his &s;hip could not proceed on her voyage, until he had received &s;ev|eral hundred pounds, which would, at the expiration of a certain number of days, be due on the bills in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He ob&s;erved, that he had fully accom|pli&s;hed every other part of his bu&s;ine&s;s; and while
<PB N="249" REF="034162_0914_0FFC5BDBB23E7510">
he calculated the probable damage the detention might occa&s;ion, he lamented the lo&s;s of tho&s;e favourable gales which &s;eemed to invite his departure.</P>
<P>"Make your&s;elf ea&s;y, Captain," replied Mr. Swale, "the money is at your &s;ervice&mdash;give me the bills&mdash;re|ceive from me their value&mdash;hoi&s;t your &s;ails&mdash;and God &s;end you a pro&s;perous voyage." Captain L&mdash;eyed the waterman with a look of incredulity and &s;urpri&s;e: He was at a lo&s;s how to under&s;tand him&mdash;Was he in|dulging that vein of humour for which he was &s;o re|markable? Was his benevolence &s;o far intere&s;ted, as to &s;timulate him to <HI>attempt</HI> borrowing the money? or, could he really command the &s;um in que&s;tion? My young friend wears an hone&s;t countenance, and the perplexity of his mind being impre&s;&s;ed on his fea|tures, Mr. Swale added: "O! upon my troth, Cap|tain, it is true&mdash;your waterman would advance a much larger &s;um, to help an hone&s;t man, impatient to return to his family and friends: The money, as I told you, &s;hall be ready at a minute's warning; and we will &s;corn to make any words about it."</P>
<P>Captain L&mdash;, divided, between admiration of the waterman's genero&s;ity, and a&s;toni&s;hment at his ability, contented him&s;elf by expre&s;&s;ing, in general terms, his gratitude, and immediately went in &s;earch of a per&s;on, who had offered to advance the money, upon a con|&s;ideration which he had deemed exorbitant: Yet, the urgency of his affairs had nece&s;&s;itated him to balance in his mind, the probable con&s;equences of acceptance or rejection; and he had determined to come to a con|clu&s;ion that very evening. He related to the u&s;urer Swale's offer, and the commercial gentleman replied: "Ah! that Swale has taken many a guinea out of my pocket; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es forty thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling, independent of the world; and he is eternally engaged in acts of this kind, for which we dealers in money owe him little thanks." Captain L&mdash;re|turned, accepted the genero&s;ity of the waterman, who appeared overjoyed in an opportunity of obliging him,

<P>Applied to, on a certain occa&s;ion, by a female in di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, for pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the &s;tate of my finances at that time would not admit of my affording the &s;ufferer any con&s;iderable relief; and, although I was on ea&s;y terms with many per&s;ons in affluence, whom I felt &s;trongly impelled to addre&s;s, yet accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider <HI>riches as &s;teeling the heart,</HI> I conceived that, wafted on the &s;tream of plea&s;ure, and marking their hours only by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of enjoyments, they would hardly find lei&s;ure for a tale of &s;orrow.

Con&s;cience, that faithful vicegerent, ever opportune in its admonitions, forcibly impre&s;|&s;ed on his mind the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e children of penury who were doomed, with each revolving day, to reiterate &s;ufferings that he now found almo&s;t in&s;up|portable. What wonders are wrought by &s;ympathy! In a tremulous voice he addre&s;&s;ed his &s;ervant:</P>
<P>"<HI>John, it is a bitter day&mdash;a bitter day, John;</HI> remem|ber, when I get home, that I &s;end poor James's wife and children a little fuel; and, do you hear, I will add &s;omething for a breakfa&s;t too! <HI>Heaven help us; we &s;hall not live here always!</HI> I &s;ay, John, you will be &s;ure to remember!" John &s;tared, doubted, and replied, "<HI>Yes, Sir, I will be &s;ure to remember;</HI>" and, la&s;hing his hor&s;es, he proceeded with more than u&s;ual rapidity, until he produced his ma&s;ter at the gate of his own dwelling. Paucius entered&mdash;the armed chair, the blazing hearth, the &s;moaking kettle, and well &s;pread table, awaited his coming&mdash;he fed luxuriou&s;ly. John, too, made his breakfa&s;t, and, bowing mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, informed his ma&s;ter that he was ready to convey his bounty to the family of James. "Stop, John&mdash;&s;top, John," cried Paucius, "we will defer what we were &s;peaking of&mdash;It is no matter now, child, <HI>the weather is quite moderate to what it was, and I dare &s;ay the wind will &s;oon be &s;outherly.</HI>"</P>
<P>No, I do not affirm that benevolence predominates in every in&s;tance. Would to God that I could thus pronounce. I only contend that it is found <HI>indi&s;crimi|nately</HI> with rich and poor; and that it is neither con|ferred nor dimini&s;hed by wealth.</P>
<P>Two days &s;ince, as I was chatting with Marcella, in a little &s;anctuary where &s;he receives her &s;upplicants, a female a&s;&s;i&s;tant introduced a &s;orrow-worn veteran; he bowed low to Marcella; the lines of his expre&s;&s;ive countenance were affectingly marked; and while he
<PB N="254" REF="034162_0920_0FFC5BC54EB30408">
addre&s;&s;ed her, (who&s;e patronage he &s;olicited) the dig|nity of the &s;oldier, &s;till &s;trikingly vi&s;ible, was &s;trongly contra&s;ted by a deep &s;en&s;e of humiliation. "I am a poor man, Madam&mdash;<HI>I was engaged in defending the lib|erties of America&mdash;I lo&s;t my right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by a cannon-ball at the battle of Bunker Hill</HI>&mdash;I have a &s;ick wife, and a fami|ly of &s;uffering children&mdash;my health is gone&mdash;I am old, Madam&mdash;there is a cold winter coming on; and I am a petitioner to per&s;ons of ability for the means of liv|ing." What an appeal to the feelings of an Ameri|can! But Marcella is governed by rea&s;on; &s;he does not indi&s;criminately lavi&s;h the bounty of Heaven; &s;he made the proper inquiries; her chariot was ordered out; on that very afternoon &s;he vi&s;ited the family of the &s;oldier; his report was ju&s;t; and both he, and his, are entered among tho&s;e who are entitled to her bounty.</P>
<P>I repeat, it is plea&s;ant to record in&s;tances of benigni|ty; and, on this &s;ubject, thought produces thought, while many a little anecdote pre&s;&s;es on my memory. An intere&s;ting female, long &s;ince numbered with the dead, now meets my view. Her figure is &s;till before me&mdash;tall, thin, and emaciated almo&s;t to a &s;keleton&mdash;poverty, lo&s;s of friends, and wa&s;ting &s;ickne&s;s, had done more toward furrowing her check, than the gently in|denting hand of time. She was a widow, and her chil|dren were all helple&s;s; her manners were &s;imple and unadorned; &s;he was altogether void of affectation; and I believe &s;he could not have fabricated an untruth, al|though &s;he might thus have &s;ucceeded to much wealth. It did not &s;eem her aim to move the pa&s;&s;ions: She only ob&s;erved, while holding in her trembling hand a &s;mall parcel of powdered maize&mdash;(and &s;he delivered her&s;elf in a tone of uncommon humility and re&s;ignation) "<HI>I have worked diligently during this long day, and this is all I have gotten.</HI>" There was &s;omething in her countenance which pointed her words; and a languid beam, e&s;cap|ing from her expre&s;&s;ive eye, forcibly made its appeal to the heart. It happened that I was, at that moment, &s;eated in the bow window in the parlour of Amanda,
<PB N="255" REF="034162_0921_0FFC5BC227840EF0">
while that lovely woman, &s;tanding in the door, was giving &s;ome directions to her gardener. The pity mov|ing female had placed one foot on the lower &s;tone of a flight of &s;teps which led to the hou&s;e, when &s;he uttered the before cited &s;entence&mdash;"<HI>I have worked diligently dur|ing this long day, and this is all (holding up the maize) that I have gotten.</HI>" "Step in, hone&s;t friend," &s;aid Aman|da, (and Heaven ble&s;s you, involuntarily exclaimed my heart) "you &s;eem not well able to labour; accept this gla&s;s of wine, it will do you good."</P>
<P>The poor woman waited not for entreaty; with an air of genuine gratitude &s;he &s;wallowed the draught. "Thank you, Madam; your wine is a cordial to which I have not of late been u&s;ed." "Take a &s;eat," cried Amanda, "<HI>I wi&s;h to conver&s;e with you.</HI>" The patient &s;ufferer rai&s;ed her eyes with an expre&s;&s;ion of a&s;toni&s;h|ment; and, glancing on her time-worn ve&s;tments the glow of &s;en&s;ibility, which in&s;tantly pervaded her fea|tures, &s;eemed to &s;ay, "Alas! alas! I dare not avail my&s;elf of your conde&s;cen&s;ion." Amanda could read the countenance&mdash;"<HI>No matter,</HI>" &s;he rejoined, "I do not accept your apology; your garments are vouchers of your indu&s;try&mdash;I wi&s;h to know if you have any children?"&mdash;"Yes, indeed, Madam, I have no le&s;s than <HI>&s;ix</HI> children, and they are all young: We did bravely as long as Robert lived and was able to labour; but he fell &s;ick and died, and all that we had was not more than &s;ufficient to lay him in the ground; yet, after a while, we did well again, until I caught a fever which left me very low, but I am now getting better; my children, I ble&s;s God, are all well; and I would not part with one of them, if I might gain the riches of the world; this meal will once more &s;atisfy their hunger: and, after all, it might have been wor&s;e&mdash;He that made us, will, I doubt not, provide for us; and we &s;hall hereafter meet Robert again in a better world." Her apparent tranquillity and <HI>genuine piety</HI> was extreme|ly affecting. Amanda took out her pur&s;e&mdash;She con&s;ult|ed in her benefaction her own liberal heart; while the indigent &s;ufferer, bur&s;ting into tears, attempted in
<PB N="256" REF="034162_0922_0FFC5BC0A35FC170">
vain to give utterance to her feelings. Amanda con|tinued to watch over this daughter of &s;orrow&mdash;&s;he vi&s;ited her at her cottage&mdash;&s;he contributed largely to her &s;upport&mdash;her con&s;olatory &s;oothings mitigated the pangs of di&s;&s;olving nature, and &s;he is &s;till the friend of her children.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that the utmo&s;t malice of fortune can involve Amanda in a &s;ituation which will deprive her of the rapturous glow of &s;elf-complacency, while &s;he reflects on this tran&s;action? But the life of Amanda hath exhibited an unbroken &s;eries of well-judged char|ities.</P>
<P>I turn over another leaf, and a new &s;cene pre&s;ents: A debtor, once immured within the walls of a pri&s;on, now hails the incalculable ble&s;&s;ings of light and liberty. He made application, by letter, to the teacher of a religious &s;ociety, &s;upplicating for &s;ome <HI>&s;mall pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance during his captivity.</HI> It was on a Sabbath Day, ju&s;t when the man of God was a&s;cending the &s;acred de&s;k, that the addre&s;s was put into his hands; and, adapting his di&s;cour&s;e to the &s;ituation of the pri&s;|oner, he introduced and pathetically expatiated there|on. Every word he uttered was pointed to the hearts of his hearers; and, glowing with benevolence, a number of tho&s;e, who&s;e abilities corre&s;ponded with the liberality of their &s;entiments, a&s;&s;embled in the ve&s;|try, where they cheerfully made up a &s;um more than &s;ufficient to procure the enlargement of the unhappy &s;olicitor. The deputed committee repaired expedi|tiou&s;ly to the pri&s;on, the money was depo&s;ited, and the overplus pre&s;ented to the captive, who, thus un|expectedly liberated from a comfortle&s;s confinement, was &s;uddenly re&s;tored to a beloved family, which had been nearly overwhelmed by de&s;pair. The whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s was planned and accompli&s;hed within three revolving hours; it &s;eems to have been conduct|ed in the true &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, and is highly wor|thy of imitation.</P>
<P>Eugenio was a principal in the affair; but to Eugenio acts of kindne&s;s are familiar; I rejoice that he takes rank in the circle of my religious friends;
<PB N="257" REF="034162_0923_0FFC5BBF1D724CB0">
he makes it a rule to recompen&s;e injuries, as often as it is in his power, by a pecuniary benefaction. A per&s;on, not long &s;ince, who was a &s;tranger to his uncommon virtues, entirely mi&s;conceived an intere&s;t|ing tran&s;action, and became in con&s;equence his im|placable enemy. It was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ain that Eugenio a&s;&s;ayed to ju&s;tify him&s;elf; his foe was rude, vehement, and highly imprudent, and he lo&s;t no opportunity of in|veighing again&s;t him. Eugenio a&s;&s;ured him that he would embrace the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of &s;eeking revenge; and he advi&s;ed him, therefore, to be more &s;paring of his invectives. Thus, for &s;ome time, they proceeded; the aggre&s;&s;or adding to, and aggravating his offences, and the aggrieved as con&s;tantly avowing his vindictive purpo&s;es. Misfortunes at length overtook the angry man; "<HI>woes do indeed too often clu&s;ter;</HI>" he was &s;trip|ped of the means of living, and confined a clo&s;e pri&s;on|er within the <HI>bare walls</HI> of a little tenement, which alone remained to him.</P>
<P><HI>Eugenio's hour of retribution was at length arrived;</HI> he immediately took in his affairs an active part; he approached him with that kind of re&s;pect, which true benevolence knows to pay to the children of adver&s;ity; he liberally admini&s;tered to his nece&s;&s;ities, and he con|tributed largely to his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment. The fir&s;t vi&s;it Eugenio paid to the dejected and deeply humbled man was inexpre&s;&s;ibly affecting; his re&s;entments were all pro&s;trated, malice was di&s;armed, admiration triumph|ed&mdash;and as he folded his exalted benefactor to his bo&s;|om, tears of unfeigned contrition bedewed his cheeks.&mdash;How noble was the revenge of Eugenio.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CONFESS my&s;elf a convert to the opinion I la&s;t evening pertinaciou&s;ly combated&mdash;Tranquillity of mind is not <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> either conferred or de&s;troyed by <HI>exter|nal circum&s;tances.</HI> Mrs. Hamilton, with beautiful mod|e&s;ty,
<PB N="258" REF="034162_0924_0FFC5BBD95EABBA8">
advocated this &s;entiment; and although you continued &s;ilent, your approbation of your daughter's arguments was &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed in your countenance.</P>
<P>My morning's ramble has produced a conviction that I ha&s;ten to acknowledge; for I am anxious to &s;upport an hypothe&s;is, which I now conceive &s;tamped with truth and rea&s;on. The &s;torm having &s;ub&s;ided, the keen &s;everity of the air, operating as a bracer, gave a very high tone to my &s;pirits, and I determined to look in on a number of my connexions. I &s;hall not aim at giving you a regular detail of my vi&s;its&mdash;two only are to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was made to an old gentleman, who for the greater part of his life has enjoyed every thing which competence can be&s;tow; but reduced by a &s;e|ries of misfortunes to penury, after having numbered more than three&s;core and ten years, he is now pennyle&s;s! he has taken &s;helter in a &s;ingle apartment &s;uited to his circum&s;tances; and I found him alone, hovering over the remains of a coal fire, but ill calculated for a tenement much out of repair, and a &s;ea&s;on &s;o truly in|clement. I looked around, no ve&s;tige of &s;u&s;tenance of any de&s;cription appeared; I &s;u&s;pected he was wholly de&s;titute of the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and although I felt my&s;elf incapable of uttering a &s;yllable, my di&s;tre&s;s was deeply marked upon my features; he read my concern, and laying his &s;pread hand upon his bo&s;om, with a &s;mile of ineffable complacency, he gratefully &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ah my friend, you are mi&s;taken; it is true, for tho&s;e three days and nights during which the &s;torm hath continued, I have not &s;een a human face; it is true, that my pitcher of water, and a &s;mall portion of bread, the la&s;t of which I have ju&s;t &s;wallowed, hath been my only &s;u&s;tenance; but never have I pa&s;&s;ed three more happy days. Stretched on that little bed, or traver&s;ing up and down this lonely rece&s;s, <HI>I have enjoyed &s;weet communion with my Maker; the bli&s;s of heaven is begun in my bo&s;om; I have, Sir, no regrets, no apprehen&s;ions, no impatience; I am all ble&s;&s;ed hope, rap|turous anticipation, and calm re&s;ignation.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="034162_0925_0FFC5BBC0FDE31E0">
I was beyond mea&s;ure a&s;toni&s;hed; and, &s;olicitous &s;till to detain the &s;aint, who &s;eemed on the wing to depart, I in&s;tantly quitted his abode; and, entering &s;he man&s;ion of a &s;on of affluence, the blazing hearth triumphed over the rigours of the &s;ea&s;on. Nature, in a variety of her mo&s;t beautiful productions, bloomed around; the birds warbled enchantingly in their gild|ed enclo&s;ures, and the genial month of June &s;eemed &s;uddenly re&s;tored.</P>
<P>"<HI>Where is your ma&s;ter?" "He is very ill, Sir.</HI>" I &s;ighed from a double motive; but I was admitted, on &s;ending up my name. I found my opulent friend deeply &s;uffering from indi&s;po&s;ition of body, and irre|pre&s;&s;ible inquietude of mind; &s;urely, thought I, Mrs. Hamilton is right. His di&s;ea&s;e was the ery&s;ipelas. "I am &s;orry, Sir, to find you &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed." "Oh faith, I &s;hall never love the name of a &s;aint again as long as I live, this &s;ame Saint Anthony has u&s;ed me &s;o &s;curvily." "It is a pity indeed you are not be|low, you have quite an <HI>artificial</HI> &s;ummer there." "Yes, faith; but many hone&s;t people in this town feel it to be a very <HI>natural</HI> winter for all that." "True, Sir; and I have this moment witne&s;&s;ed a &s;cene which corroborates your a&s;&s;ertion."</P>
<P>I then gave in my little narrative; my affluent friend was benevolent and liberal; the di&s;orders of his mind and body &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pend their progre&s;s, and he eagerly replied, "I remember this &s;ame old gentle|man lent me, when I was a boy, fourteen pen&s;e; now I do not believe I ever paid him that little &s;um; plea&s;e to open that draw, take them crowns, and beg his accept|ance; <HI>they may an&s;wer both principal and intere&s;t.</HI>" He in&s;tantly rung the bell&mdash;Thomas appeared, who was commi&s;&s;ioned immediately to convey to Mr.&mdash;a variety of nece&s;&s;ary articles, to add thereto <HI>a bottle of that old &s;pirit, re&s;erved for &s;pecial occa&s;ions;</HI> and he was directed to let no day pa&s;s without bearing to the ven|erable man a portion of the choice&s;t viands which his table afforded.</P>

<P>HARDLY a day pa&s;&s;es that does not furni&s;h &s;ome new in&s;tance of the paucity of national attach|ment in our country. We regret much the frequent occa&s;ions which impel us to reiterate expre&s;&s;ions of concern, on account of an evil &s;o truly alarming. The real patriot mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lament the pre&s;ent a&s;pect of affairs. French men and mea&s;ures&mdash;Engli&s;h men and mea&s;ures. The&s;e do in fact divide the majority of the people; while tho&s;e who rally round the &s;tandard of America are reduced to a very incon&s;iderable party.</P>
<P>We are far removed from the elder world; the wide Atlantic is our barrier. Per&s;ons of information affirm, that we po&s;&s;e&s;s within our&s;elves the &s;ources of independ|ence; and it is certainly true, that the interior of our country, reduced to a &s;tate of cultivation, would become amply productive, largely &s;upplying every <HI>e&s;&s;ential ar|ticle of life.</HI> Nece&s;&s;ity is pronounced the mother of in|vention&mdash;Improvement follows; and tho&s;e elegancies, or &s;uperfluities, to which we are attached, would, by a natural proce&s;s, become the growth of America. Why then do we not <HI>radically throw off every foreign yoke</HI>&mdash;a&s;|&s;ert
<PB N="261" REF="034162_0927_0FFC5BB22ABAF318">
our&s;elves, and no longer delay to fill our rank as free, &s;overeign, and independent States?</P>
<P>While I am writing, a circle of ladies in the next room are di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this very &s;ubject, and a re&s;pectable female, in an elevated tone of voice, declares, &s;he had rather take the fa&s;hion of her garments from an American pre&s;identre&s;s, than from any prince&s;s in Eu|rope. We wi&s;h this idea was adopted, from the State of New-Hamp&s;hire, to tho&s;e far di&s;tant and exten&s;ive banks, who&s;e verdant borders are wa&s;hed by the waters of the Ohio; and that American habiliments, politics, and &s;entiments of every de&s;cription, might hencefor|ward receive an American &s;tamp.</P>
<P>Perhaps our deficiency in national partiality is in nothing more apparent than in the little ta&s;te we di&s;|cover for American literature. Indigenous produc|tions are received with cold neglect, if not contempt, or they are condemned to an ordeal, the &s;everity of which is &s;ufficient to terrify the mo&s;t daring adventur|er. Mortifying indifference, or invidious critici&s;m&mdash;the&s;e, in their re&s;pective operations, chill the opening bud, or bla&s;t its expan&s;ive leaves, and the apathy with which we regard the toils of intellect, is truly a&s;toni&s;h|ing. An original genius hath produced a &s;entiment of the following nature: <HI>If the fir&s;t rate abilities, cloathed in the habiliments of mortality, were pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treets of our metropolis, they would be elbowed by the crowd, knocked down by a truckman, or rode over by a hackney coach.</HI> And we add&mdash;better &s;o, than if they were con|&s;igned to the lingering tortures of the rack, or con|demned to &s;uffer death under the axe of a mangling and barbarous executioner.</P>
<P>We do not &s;ay that the office of a <HI>candid critic</HI> is not beneficial, and even <HI>e&s;&s;ential:</HI> But when an author, or his productions, are to be di&s;&s;ected, in the name of every principle of humanity let a <HI>man of feeling pre&s;ide</HI>&mdash;let the operation be conducted by an arti&s;t, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the abilities to di&s;criminate, will be governed by the admo|nitions of decency. An informed, judicious, and well di&s;po&s;ed critic, will not wholly reject the influence of
<PB N="262" REF="034162_0928_0FFC5BAEB32790D8">
&s;ympathy; and his feelings will induce him, when call|ing into view a glaring ab&s;urdity, to produce, if po&s;&s;i|ble, &s;ome plea&s;ing &s;election, which may &s;oothe the bo|&s;om he is thus nece&s;&s;itated to lacerate. When a work is to be analyzed, if the plot is deficient in conception, and in adju&s;tment&mdash;if the ideas are extravagant, the events tragical, and the cata&s;trophe improbable&mdash;the critic, if he is not a <HI>u&s;urper,</HI> if he is legally inve&s;ted with the robes of office, will, however, find &s;omething to ad|mire in the &s;tyle; and if it abounds with ju&s;t &s;enti|ments, and cla&s;&s;ical allu&s;ions, he will produce them, not only with marks of decided approbation, but with triumph.</P>
<P>The &s;tage is undoubtedly a very powerful engine in forming the opinions and manners of a people. Is it not then of importance to &s;upply the American &s;tage with American &s;cenes? I am aware that very few pro|ductions in this line have appeared, and I think the rea&s;on is obvious. Writers, e&s;pecially dramatic wri|ters, are not properly encouraged. Applau&s;e, that powerful &s;pring of action, (if we except the ebullitions of the moment) is withheld, or &s;paringly admini&s;tered. No incentives are furni&s;hed, and indignant genius, con|&s;cious of its own re&s;ources, retires to the intellectual banquet, di&s;daining to &s;pread the fea&s;t for malevolence and ingratitude.</P>
<P>If productions, <HI>confe&s;&s;edly indifferent,</HI> were, from the a&s;cendency of local preferences, <HI>endured in their turn, and received with manife&s;t partiality,</HI> it would, perhaps, &s;timulate to more poli&s;hed efforts, and the Columbian Drama might at length boa&s;t the mo&s;t fini&s;hed pro|ductions. But &s;o far are we from evincing this predi|lection that even performances, decidedly meritorious, are almo&s;t forgotten. Tyler's plays are &s;trangely neg|lected; and the fini&s;hed &s;cenes of the correct and ele|gant Mrs. Warren, have never yet pa&s;&s;ed in review be|fore an American audience. Was the American ta&s;te decidedly in favour of native worth, the &s;uperintend|ants of the Drama would find it for their intere&s;t to cheri&s;h indigenous abilities, and the influence of
<PB N="263" REF="034162_0929_0FFC5BAB8E754370">
patronage would invigorate and rear to maturity the now drooping plant.</P>
<P>To the celebrity of Mrs. Warren, it is beyond the power of the Gleaner to add: Yet, accu&s;toming him|&s;elf to join i&s;&s;ue with tho&s;e who yield the palm to ge|nius, he is con&s;trained to &s;ay, that her excellent trage|dies abound with the pathetic, the beautiful, and the &s;ublime, and that they apparently po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ufficient &s;cenic merit and variety of &s;ituation to be&s;tow tho&s;e <HI>ar|tificial advantages</HI> which are nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ure their <HI>&s;tage effect.</HI> Camps, palaces, cities&mdash;a view of the orb of day, ju&s;t emerging from the &s;hades of night&mdash;a&s;|&s;embled &s;enators&mdash;citizens pa&s;&s;ing up and down&mdash;a proce&s;&s;ion of prie&s;ts, &s;enators, and nobles, addre&s;&s;ing, in the attitude of &s;upplication, a Vandal tyrant&mdash;gardens, grottos&mdash;a wilderne&s;s, an alcove&mdash;&s;houts of victory&mdash;a pri&s;on, a battle&mdash;repeated acts of &s;uicide.

Powell, while in the characters of Edoxia, or Eudocia in the Sack of Rome, and of Donna Loui&s;a in the Ladies of Ca&s;tile, &s;he delivered &s;entiments truly intere&s;ting, highly wrought, and tenderly pathetic: We have of|ten in imagination li&s;tened to the language of Loui&s;a, from our favourite performer, and mo&s;t admirably has &s;he pointed every &s;entence.</P>
<P>We conceive that Mrs. Warren, while delineating Donna Maria, traced in her own &s;trong and lumi|nous intellect the animated original which &s;he pre&s;ent|ed; and, making up a judgment from information, which we pre&s;ume accurate, we have not he&s;itated to pronounce our celebrated countrywoman the <HI>Roland</HI> of America. The addre&s;s of Donna Maria to Lou|i&s;a, in page 119, is truly beautiful. The character of Gaudentius in the Sack of Rome is finely conceived, &s;trongly intere&s;ting, and well &s;upported; his reflections on di&s;covering his murdered father, are natural and
<PB N="264" REF="034162_0930_0FFC5BA68384C1C0">
highly fini&s;hed; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to read without a degree of pen&s;ive &s;olemnity his &s;oliloquy in the grot|to. Maximus mourning his Aredelia dead, mu&s;t com|mand the &s;ympathetic gu&s;h; and while the &s;tory of the empre&s;s is replete with in&s;truction, her accumulat|ed woes pierce the bo&s;om of &s;en&s;ibility. Don Juan|in the Ladies of Ca&s;tile, exhibits virtues which an|nounce him the kindred &s;pirit of his Maria; and his native independence, his valour and his magnanimity are uniformly exemplified. The virtues of Conde Haro we &s;pontaneou&s;ly revere; and we li&s;ten, with pe|culiar &s;atisfaction, to &s;entiments re&s;ulting from benev|olence and a ju&s;t idea of the rights of man, as they are delivered by the adver&s;e chief, while the woes of Don Francis and Donna Loui&s;a excite our tendere&s;t feelings.</P>
<P>Contemplating the&s;e &s;pecimens of our drama, con|fe&s;&s;edly excellent, a very natural inference pre&s;ents&mdash;If compo&s;itions of this de&s;cription find no place on the American &s;tage, what can the more humble ad|venturer expect? Are not the pre&s;ent arrangements highly impolitic? Is it not probable that talents, now dormant, might by proper encouragement be called into action? Is it not po&s;&s;ible that paths, yet untrod|den in the regions of nature and of fancy, remain to be explored? and that under the fo&s;tering &s;miles of a liberal and enlightened public, Columbian Shake|&s;peares may yet elevate and adorn humanity?</P>
<P>The efforts of one of the mo&s;t celebrated dramatic writers of the pre&s;ent century are &s;aid to have origi|nated in accident. If our information is correct, Mrs. Cowley was both a wife and mother before &s;he had at|tempted even a paragraph for a magazine or new&s;pa|per; her pen, appropriated to the claims of kindred or friend&s;hip, had produced only private letters, and to the toils of genius &s;he was a &s;tranger. But being pre&s;ent at the theatre, during the repre&s;entation of a very indifferent play, which from caprice or partiality was, however, received with uncommon marks of ap|plau&s;e, &s;he was forcibly &s;truck with the in&s;ignificancy
<PB N="265" REF="034162_0931_0FFC5BA4FA6186B0">
of many of the dialogues; and, conceiving that a me|diocrity of talents, with the requi&s;ite application, would be fully adequate to &s;imilar productions, &s;he re|tired from the play-hou&s;e with an irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;ire to enter a career, at once lucrative and honorary.</P>
<P>Mrs. Cowley was an early ri&s;er; and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the hours redeemed from the pillow, in the nur&s;ery with her children, who were under &s;uch regulations, as to admit of her pur&s;uing, with plea&s;ure and advantage, her needle, her book, or her pen. It was on the morn|ing immediately &s;ucceeding the evening &s;he pa&s;&s;ed at the play-hou&s;e, that, quitting the nur&s;ery for the break|fa&s;ting parlour, &s;he pre&s;ented her hu&s;band with the two fir&s;t &s;cenes in the fir&s;t act of her comedy, called The Runaway. Mr. Cowley was mo&s;t agreeably &s;ur|pri&s;ed, and not only gave his &s;anction to her enterpri&s;e, but warmly urged the pro&s;ecution of her plan. The play was accordingly fini&s;hed, and entru&s;ted to a friend who was commi&s;&s;ioned to enclo&s;e it to Mr. Garrick, then manager of Drury Lane Theatre, as the production of a lady. A period was fixed for Mr. Garrick's de|ci&s;ion on the merit of the piece, and its eligibility for the &s;tage; at the expiration of which period, the friend of Mrs. Cowley waited on the manager, reque&s;ting his candid opinion. The &s;entiments of Mr. Garrick were in&s;tantly mo&s;t flatteringly developed, not by an an&s;wer in form, but by a number of interrogations, worded in his accu&s;tomed energetic manner.</P>
<P>"For God's &s;ake, where has that lady lived? where is &s;he now? who is &s;he? cannot I &s;ee her?" &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Mrs. Cowley was &s;oon introduced to Mr. Garrick&mdash;their fir&s;t meeting was in a beautifully romantic tem|ple, which he had reared to the honour of Shake&s;pear; and they exchanged &s;ome brilliant compliments, which received point from their allu&s;ion to the <HI>bard of Avon.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Cowley's play was brought forward with eve|ry po&s;&s;ible advantage&mdash;the road to wealth and fame was thrown open to its fair Authore&s;s; and we are told that no year has &s;ince revolved on which &s;he has
<PB N="266" REF="034162_0932_0FFC5BA3733ABF00">
not produced one, or more, highly fini&s;hed drama. Such are the fruits of judicious applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The Comedy of the Runaway was the la&s;t play that Mr. Garrick u&s;hered to public notice.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE pre&s;ent prevalent rage for every thing theatri|cal, may render the &s;ub&s;tance of the following little an|ecdote, relative to a celebrated performer, acceptable to your readers; and if your &s;entiments corre&s;pond with this idea, you will give it a page in your mi&s;cellany.</P>
<P>Certain a&s;&s;emblies, <HI>y'clepped &s;pouting clubs,</HI> in the city of London, have frequently been &s;anctioned by the pre&s;ence of many of the nobility, among whom the Dutche&s;s of&mdash;was in the habit of amu&s;ing her&s;elf, by ob&s;erving, in tho&s;e nur&s;eries of the drama, the va|rious abilities of young per&s;ons, who, animated by a patronage &s;o re&s;pectable, exhibited with every po&s;&s;ible advantage. It happened on one of tho&s;e occa&s;ions, that the Dutche&s;s &s;aw and di&s;tingui&s;hed Mr. Holland; and &s;he immediately marked him down as a future or|nament of the Briti&s;h &s;tage. Holland was a young man, well connected, and of decent life and manners; nature had been liberal to him, and he was by no means de&s;titute of the aids of education. The &s;tage had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his warme&s;t wi&s;hes; but the great point was, to make his <HI>debut</HI> under an au&s;picious pat|ronage; and the Dutche&s;s, informed of his views, im|mediately conceived the re&s;olution of recommending him to Garrick; &s;he had often conferred on this cele|brated dramatic performer <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> marks of her ap|probation; and it did not con&s;i&s;t with his intere&s;t to negative a youth, for whom her Grace had avowed a predilection. But if we may credit report, Garrick <HI>did not always lend his countenance to merit;</HI> it is certain he was oppo&s;ed to Holland's advancement; and, ob|taining intelligence of an introductory letter to be de|livered
<PB N="267" REF="034162_0933_0FFC5A81ED8876B0">
into his own hand, he determined never to be at home to the bearer. Holland repeatedly a&s;&s;ailed his door, but the <HI>great man</HI> was always denied, and the youth de&s;paired of gaining admittance in his own character.</P>
<P>He was not, however, di&s;couraged; and his ingenu|ity helping him to an expedient, he obtained, at the price of half a guinea, the habit, ba&s;ket and tally of the lad who &s;erved the family of Garrick with hot rolls; when, pre&s;enting him&s;elf before the door of him whom he regarded as the arbiter of his future de&s;tiny, he informed the &s;ervant in waiting, that his ma&s;ter having taken a new apprentice, it was nece&s;&s;ary old arrearages &s;hould be paid off; and that he had accord|ingly given him a &s;mall bill, which he had directed him to deliver to Mr. Garrick. Garrick, ever atten|tive to tho&s;e kind of claims, admitted the baker's lad without difficulty; and, &s;eated in his elbow chair, in a morning gown of <HI>crim&s;on</HI> dama&s;k, he received with abundance of &s;tate the folded paper, which prov|ing, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, the introductory letter of the Dutche&s;s, the redoubtable hero of the &s;ock and bu&s;kin, caught in the toils, &s;ternly que&s;tioned, "Pray, young man, was there no way of pre&s;enting this letter but in di&s;gui&s;e?"</P>
<P>"None that occurred to me, Sir; I have repeated|ly waited on you without &s;ucce&s;s, and I have at length embraced the expedient of &s;erving your Honor with bread."</P>
<P>"Well, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed you have a fruitful in|vention, and having thus ingeniou&s;ly made your <HI>entree,</HI> I pre&s;ume you imagine your&s;elf fit for any thing."</P>
<P>"At pre&s;ent, Sir, <HI>for nothing but &s;erving your Honor with bread.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Upon my word, you are wonderfully ready; but we wi&s;h for a &s;pecimen of your theatrical abilities&mdash;begin if you plea&s;e." Holland, throwing him&s;elf in|to a commanding attitude, immediately with great pathos and propriety delivered a pathetic piece, appo|&s;ite and &s;triking; and the <HI>hauteur</HI> of Garrick was for a
<PB N="268" REF="034162_0934_0FFC5A8068C21118">
moment &s;u&s;pended; but, determined not to be plea&s;ed, he threw into his countenance a freezing quantum of frigidity, and &s;uperciliou&s;ly &s;aid, "Mighty apt, and &s;tudied no doubt for the occa&s;ion; but you will plea&s;e to favour us with an exhibition of your <HI>comic</HI> pow|ers; you mu&s;t be <HI>great</HI> in every way."</P>
<P>"Alas! Sir, I have at this moment no <HI>comic</HI> ideas!"</P>
<P>"But you mu&s;t learn to a&s;&s;ume; <HI>you are to com|mence actor, you know.</HI>" The youth, flinging from his hand the tally, which he had held until that in&s;tant, tripped lightly over the floor, and, &s;electing from one of Mr. Garrick's be&s;t parts a favourite pa&s;&s;age, he &s;ud|denly became prime mini&s;ter of frolick; his attitude was that of humour&mdash;mirth revell'd on his cheek&mdash;Tha|lia moulded every feature, laughed in his eye, and play|ed on his tongue; and even the ri&s;ibles of Garrick con|fe&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hing powers; but recollecting him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;uming great &s;olemnity, he gravely ob&s;erved: "Let me tell you, young man, there is a wide differ|ence between reciting here, in a private apartment, and in appearing on a Briti&s;h &s;tage, before the mo&s;t augu&s;t audience in the world."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Sir, I conceive that I am now before the <HI>mo&s;t augu&s;t audience in the world.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, young gentleman, this compliment may be well turned; but permit me to remind you, the Briti&s;h audience is made up of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters, of per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power and ability to decide irrevocably your fate; and on the drawing up of the curtain, you are immediately in the pre&s;ence of thou&s;ands, who will conceive them&s;elves ve&s;ted with full authority to pronounce your immediate annihila|tion! What think you will be your feelings at &s;uch a moment! Can you &s;tand an ordeal &s;o &s;evere?"</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, Sir, I humbly conceive I have as de|cent a &s;tock of <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> as your Honor, or any other man in exi&s;tence." "By Jove," returned Garrick, "<HI>I believe it.</HI>" And, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, this la&s;t &s;troke captivating the manager, Holland was im|mediately

engaged, who &s;oon becoming the favourite of the public, always commanded full hou&s;es, and before the completion of a &s;ingle year, his &s;tated &s;ala|ry was one thou&s;and pounds per annum; he contrib|uted greatly to the emolument of the Drury Lane theatre, and the penetration of her Grace was held in high veneration.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>JUST returned from vi&s;iting my friend Leonora, I &s;it my&s;elf down to &s;ketch for your Mi&s;cellany, an account of this my &s;econd excur&s;ion; and I do a&s;&s;ure you, I feel, while thus employed, that &s;ort of &s;atisfac|tion, which a well-di&s;po&s;ed woman will always experi|ence, when &s;he can, without doing violence to her ve|racity, expatiate upon the &s;ocial plea&s;ures of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But, fir&s;t, it may be proper that I attempt giving you an idea of the character of my friend. Although &s;he was &s;ome years my elder, &s;he continued at the boarding-&s;chool at which I was placed, during the whole term appropriated to my in&s;truction; and, next to the dear woman to whom I am indebted for the vital glow of animation, &s;he contributed mo&s;t to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;h|ion and to inform my opening mind; &s;he cultivated my ta&s;te; and, originating in my bo&s;om &s;entiments of
<PB N="270" REF="034162_0936_0FFC5A7269D9DE00">
propriety, &s;he taught me to e&s;teem only tho&s;e enjoy|ments which were &s;anctioned by rea&s;on. Nature had thrown into my compo&s;ition a vein of &s;atire, which I often reprehen&s;ibly indulged; but Leonora be&s;towed upon my manners the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing poli&s;h of benignity.</P>
<P>She is a model of true politene&s;s; and, under&s;tand|ing <HI>the preci&s;e point of good-breeding,</HI> while &s;he is &s;olicit|ous to accommodate her&s;elf to all tho&s;e circles which &s;he graces by her pre&s;ence, &s;he is careful not to <HI>oppre&s;s by her civilities.</HI> Her deportment is uniformly a &s;trik|ing exemplification of <HI>lady-like dignity;</HI> and I have a thou&s;and times witne&s;&s;ed the ineffable &s;weetne&s;s of her temper. She has been at once the guide and compan|ion of &s;ome of the happie&s;t moments of my life; and the tears which I &s;hed at her departure from A&mdash;, as they were impelled by &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations, &s;o they will be reiterated as often as the importance of unfold|ing events, enforce the nece&s;&s;ity of the pre&s;ence of my &s;weet and amiable monitre&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;triking exterior and rare accompli&s;hments of Leonora, produced corre&s;ponding effects; and, after that mature deliberation which the magnitude of her &s;ubject required, &s;he elected from her train of ad|mirers, as the companion of her future life, a young gentleman, who, born and educated in Philadelphia, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a hand&s;ome property in that city. His patri|monial inheritance was con&s;iderable; and his indu&s;try and frugality have made large additions thereto. The marriage of Leonora has been mo&s;t happy; it has connected the highe&s;t felicity of which wedlock is &s;u&s;|ceptible, while every plea&s;ure has been enhanced by a lovely train of &s;ons and daughters, who, the probabil|ity is, will one day con&s;titute the faire&s;t ornaments of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Neither Leonora, nor her Evander, have any predi|lection for the di&s;&s;ipation, in which a city life almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily engages per&s;ons of fortune; and Evander, cheerfully quitting a metropolis, where his ance&s;tors had figured with much re&s;pectability, and where he him|&s;elf had &s;natched a thou&s;and juvenile plea&s;ures, has
<PB N="271" REF="034162_0937_0FFC5A6C8275D260">
retired with his little family to an elegant rece&s;s, upon the &s;kirts of a broad and exten&s;ive river. Here, &s;urren|dering him&s;elf to tho&s;e enjoyments, to which his am|ple income entitles him, his hours revolve, marked by r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tional and refined tranquillity. Having never &s;een Leonora from the time of her departure from A&mdash;, I was repeatedly &s;ummoned to her abode; and her retreat from the gari&s;h and tumultuous &s;cenes of the bu&s;y town, added new ardour to my wi&s;hes once more to embrace her.</P>
<P>But a journey of &s;ome hundreds of miles was to be taken; and having no other means of making my ex|cur&s;ion, than in the &s;everal &s;tage-coaches, where I had recently endured much vexation, places for my brother and my&s;elf were again &s;ecured; and, departing from the capital at peep of day, bu&s;ine&s;s &s;till repo&s;ing on the lap of &s;ilence, as we rattled through the &s;treets, we encountered not a &s;ingle human being; the &s;hops were as fa&s;t clo&s;ed as in the dead of night; and the appear|ance of the buildings, on either hand, &s;eemed de&s;criptive of the continued &s;lumbers which the inhabitants &s;till in|dulged. Thus pa&s;&s;ing on, we were at full liberty to ob|&s;erve, without interruption, that magnificent &s;cene, with which nature, with every returning morn, pre&s;ents the amateurs of her arrangements. I have very &s;eldom beheld the augu&s;t luminary of day &s;o re&s;plendent; an uncommon degree of tranquillity pervaded my bo&s;om; my health was perfect; and the tone of my mind &s;uch as rendered it highly &s;u&s;ceptible of all tho&s;e plea&s;ures, deducible from a view of the &s;ublime and beautiful.</P>
<P>For the information of tho&s;e per&s;ons who have not witne&s;&s;ed the progre&s;s of the morning, from the fir&s;t appearance of the dawn, to the moment when the pla&s;tic parent of day, <HI>apparently</HI> emerging from the &s;kirts of the horizon, bur&s;ts in all its &s;plendors upon the dazzled eye, I a&s;&s;ay to &s;ketch the gradual devel|opment, which forcibly arre&s;ted our attention.</P>
<P>The death-like &s;tillne&s;s, immediately preceding the opening dawn, &s;trikingly contra&s;ts the animated pic|ture, then pre&s;&s;ing upon the thre&s;hold of ob&s;ervation;
<PB N="272" REF="034162_0938_0FFC5A69BB0B2878">
and we began our journey at that preci&s;e in&s;tant, when the inten&s;e darkne&s;s which enrobes the dreary night, drawing a&s;ide its intercepting veil, gave place to the mild light of the crepu&s;cle, which, progre&s;&s;ing from the horizon, whitened the whole face of that lucid curtain, that &s;o beneficially &s;hades the &s;urrounding heavens. Every &s;ucceeding moment &s;eemed to change the a&s;pect of things; for the cheering influence of that circle, which had be&s;towed upon the azure firmament its &s;ilver hue, advancing from the ea&s;t, and embracing the wide-extended concave of the &s;kies, all tho&s;e nu|merous objects that we had &s;carcely perceived, throng|ed rapidly upon the eye&mdash;the new-born day commenced its progre&s;s, and the Aurora &s;ucceeded the crepu&s;cle&mdash;the gentle zephyrs were abroad&mdash;they &s;eemed to di&s;per&s;e the gloomy vapours of the night&mdash;the con|den&s;ed atmo&s;phere became more pure&mdash;the verdant earth a&s;&s;umed its mo&s;t beautiful tints&mdash;and the breath of morn was perfumed by a variety of &s;weets. We a&s;cended a rural eminence, which commanded a plea&s;|ing view of the thrifty hamlet, and the air re&s;ounded with the matin calls of the village chanticleer, while birds, of various notes and plumage, warbled upon the neighbouring branches.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s re&s;umed its indu&s;trious career&mdash;the hu&s;|bandman, attended by the invigorated &s;teed, harne&s;&s;ed for u&s;e, appeared upon the plain&mdash;travellers thronged the road&mdash;and workmen, accoutred for the day, ha&s;t|ened to their re&s;pective occupations.</P>
<P>Mean time, the broad horizon a&s;&s;umed cele&s;tial dies&mdash;the brightening crim&s;on &s;treaked the blue vault of heaven&mdash;pa&s;&s;ing clouds were tinged with the mo&s;t vivid hues&mdash;the Aurora momently increa&s;ed; and, adverti&s;ed by this beautiful harbinger, we eagerly ex|pected the a&s;cen&s;ion to which it pointed, and nature at length pre&s;ented us with the mo&s;t tran&s;cendent of her works. The orb of day magnificently upro&s;e; it bur&s;t upon us in all its radiance; and, as we eyed its maje&s;tic progre&s;s, we fully acquitted tho&s;e &s;ages, who, unimpre&s;&s;ed by the truths of revelation, pro&s;trat|ed
<PB N="273" REF="034162_0939_0FFC5A66B8A67100">
at the approach of this augu&s;t "<HI>parent of &s;ea&s;ons</HI>" and "<HI>king of day.</HI>" The &s;plendors of a <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> &s;un a&s;|&s;ume the mo&s;t benign a&s;pect&mdash;we ble&s;t the genial orb, and marked with gratitude its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>It happened that a beautiful little girl, on her way to a rural academy, who had never before beheld the morning foot&s;teps of the orb of day, was &s;eated in our vehicle. Her extacies and her a&s;toni&s;hment were in|effable. Never &s;hall I forget her ingenious attempts to give language to her &s;en&s;ations&mdash;Perhaps it was the fir&s;t moment &s;he had ever di&s;covered a want of words. With the endearing ardour of youth, &s;he a&s;&s;ured her papa, who accompanied her, that &s;he would never again forego an opportunity of beholding a &s;cene, which &s;urpa&s;&s;ed every thing that had before en|gaged her attention; and if her re&s;olution and per&s;e|verance are equal to her &s;weet enthu&s;ia&s;m, and amia|ble &s;u&s;ceptibility, I predict that, pur&s;uing her &s;tudies with uncommon avidity, &s;he will become a highly ac|compli&s;hed woman. Her enchanting expre&s;&s;ions and youthful wonder, I am free to own, augmented to me the felicity of the morning; and I embrace this op|portunity of reiterating my acknowledgments of grat|itude, to this lovely candidate for future excellence.</P>
<P>Fortunately for me, (that this jaunt might in every thing exhibit a perfect contra&s;t to my journey of vex|atious memory) our party con&s;i&s;ted only of this charm|ing child, her father, my brother, and my&s;elf; &s;o that I had an ab&s;olute command of the &s;pacious vehicle, in which we were thus adventitiou&s;ly and plea&s;ingly di&s;|po&s;ed: Of the front and back &s;eats I was alternately an occupant; for both Mi&s;s and her papa, while they too well <HI>practi&s;ed the art of plea&s;ing,</HI> to overpower me by the dictatorial and oppre&s;&s;ive repetition of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> would, neverthele&s;s, upon the &s;lighte&s;t indication of my wi&s;hes, have placed them|&s;elves in any corner of the vehicle which might have &s;uited my convenience. Thus charmingly we came on, enjoying delightfully the picture&s;que views, which luxuriant nature, in our progre&s;s over a prodigious
<PB N="274" REF="034162_0940_0FFC5A65299E53D0">
fine extent of country, every where di&s;played before us. We breakfa&s;ted in a little tenement, that &s;eemed fitted up by the hand of neatne&s;s; and, bringing with us the &s;auce of appetite, the healthful viands which were prepared for our refre&s;hment, &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a new and uncommon flavour.</P>
<P>So pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t day of our journey&mdash;and the &s;ep|arating from our a&s;&s;ociates in the evening, who then reached the &s;eminary, occa&s;ioned our fir&s;t regret. The &s;econd day, however, proved equally propitious; the &s;tage was not crowded; nor were we overburdened by <HI>ill-judged civilities.</HI> One old gentleman, led by an ob&s;ervation of a fellow-traveller, made many philo|&s;ophical remarks upon the journey of life. He ration|ally &s;aid, that mankind, con&s;idered as the work of an all-wi&s;e Architect, mu&s;t have been created with an <HI>ul|timate view;</HI> and that, as the augu&s;t Creator was gen|erally acknowledged to unite wi&s;dom and power, and to be omnipotently and benignly good, the purpo&s;e of creation mu&s;t primarily <HI>have been, the final felicity of the creature, who was formed preci&s;ely according to the plan of a &s;overeign, &s;elf-exi&s;tent, and independent Being:</HI> Nor (he added) did it appear, that the children of men were <HI>endowed with any faculty, which conferred a capa|bility of counteracting the original de&s;igns of Infinite Wi&s;|dom.</HI> "I &s;ay, then," continued our chri&s;tianized rea&s;oner, "<HI>that our being's end and aim is happine&s;s:</HI>" We are, in the pre&s;ent &s;cene, &s;truggling for a better &s;tate of exi&s;tence. Had we not ta&s;ted what we reckon evil, we &s;hould not have known how, properly, to ap|preciate the good; and the hour cannot be far di&s;tant, when, being "<HI>born again, we &s;hall &s;ee the kingdom of heaven,</HI>" and become the &s;ubjects of that happy ar|rangement, <HI>which leaves no "pau&s;e of bli&s;s.</HI>" For the departure of my friends, therefore, I &s;hed no tears&mdash;when they enter this life, it is then they are but em|bryoes&mdash;they pa&s;s through the dark valley&mdash;and <HI>the moment of their exit from this, is their birth into the cele&s;|tial world.</HI> Hence, upon every &s;uch event, which comes under my knowledge, I forget not to &s;hall, by
<PB N="275" REF="034162_0941_0FFC5A5D448EFA18">
a &s;ong of triumph, the liberated &s;pirit; <HI>and I am confident, that my gratulations contribute to enhance the felicity of the new-born cele&s;tial.</HI>" Yes, the old gentle|man was perhaps whim&s;ical; but we were amu&s;ed, and pa&s;&s;ed the day in his &s;ociety very plea&s;ingly: In|deed, we continued remarkably happy in our a&s;&s;o|ciates, until the evening of the &s;ixth day, when, with the &s;etting &s;un, we reached the Rece&s;s of Amity.</P>
<P>To do ju&s;tice to the manner of my reception at the paradi&s;aical villa of Evander, is beyond the power of language. Leonora, whom I &s;o immea&s;urably love and honour, attended by Evander, and accompanied by her &s;ons and daughters, (a beautifully intere&s;ting group) met me at the outermo&s;t gate of the <HI>rece&s;s;</HI> and I &s;aw, at one glance, that her native elegance and urbanity had become the inheritance of her children. As they conducted me to their man&s;ion, the mo&s;t af|fectionate expre&s;&s;ions &s;pontaneou&s;ly bur&s;t from their lips, and I was welcomed with tho&s;e demon&s;trations of joy, which were highly worthy our long continued amity. Evander is informed, &s;entimental, and man|ly; he is rich in mental re&s;ources; he is well calcu|lated for the plea&s;ures of a &s;eque&s;tered life; and the &s;erenity of his &s;oul impre&s;&s;es upon his fine countenance &s;trong indications of that "<HI>peace of mind, which good|ne&s;s bo&s;oms over.</HI>"</P>
<P>The man&s;ion of Evander is embo&s;omed by tall trees, which throw around its avenues a venerable &s;hade, and, penetrating the time-formed enclo&s;ure, up|on a gentle acclivity the well-built tenement pre&s;ents its &s;now-white front. It is entered by a gravel-walk, inclo&s;ed on either &s;ide by a neat railing, and bordered by a rich growth of various and beautiful flowers. The verdant plats, too, on the right and left, are charming additions: Indeed, every thing is highly rural; and the mo&s;t plea&s;ing expectation takes po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the mind. The hou&s;e is &s;pacious, and &s;eems to unite the ideas of &s;implicity and opulence: The out-hou&s;es are judiciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, and admirably com|modious. I have &s;aid, that the e&s;tate of Evander, is
<PB N="276" REF="034162_0942_0FFC5A5BBAA7D6B0">
wa&s;hed by a copious and fertilizing river, and its wind|ing cour&s;e, forming a number of indented points, mo&s;t plea&s;ingly diver&s;ifies the view, and produces a truly enchanting effect.</P>
<P>The tract of land in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Evander, is a location, compri&s;ing many hundred acres; it is a patrimonial inheritance, and in a high &s;tate of cultiva|tion; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great fertility of &s;oil, and &s;alubrity of climate. Many weeks pa&s;&s;ed before I had mea&s;ured it with the &s;teps of an inve&s;tigator; for I was not <HI>pre|cipitated</HI> over the grounds, at the <HI>plea&s;ure of the propri|etor, but cheerfully attended when I propo&s;ed a walk.</HI> The lands, as I &s;aid, are rich, and abundantly productive; and the air, highly impregnated with &s;weet fern, and other fragrant odours, breathes an aromatic gale, while we gratefully quaff its &s;alutary properties. Woods and lawns, hills and dales, meandering &s;treams, and trees, of various growth and fruit, alternately arre&s;t the eye. The maple tree, among the re&s;t, (the &s;accha|rine quality of which promi&s;es to become a new &s;ource of independence to this continent) yields to the inhab|itants of the rece&s;s, its riche&s;t &s;weets. Nothing can be imagined more highly picture&s;que, than many of the views upon this fine and well improved e&s;tate. The uniformity of the verdant plains is not &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive to offend; gentle a&s;cents are thrown over the grounds; the&s;e are adorned by the riche&s;t ver|dure, and variegated by tall trees, which, &s;preading their ample foliage, lift their green heads, delightfully fini&s;hing the &s;cene. The groves and vi&s;tas upon the e&s;tate of Evander, may be con&s;idered as ample and commodious aviaries, where the birds melodiou&s;ly war|ble; and no luckle&s;s hand, armed for their de&s;truction, dares to mole&s;t their operations.</P>
<P>There is, in agricultural life, a degree of independ|ence, that at once ennobles and tranquillizes the &s;pir|it; it be&s;tows that &s;ecurity, which is very conge|nial with the feelings of humanity. Thom&s;on ele|gantly de&s;cribes the felicities of rural retirement; and Evander is, in fact, the &s;entimental reclu&s;e delin|eated

by the poet. Order and propriety pre&s;ide in his family; his Leonora is ever rationally indulgent; and her abode is the re&s;idence of harmony.</P>
<P>A retired apartment in the rece&s;s is con&s;ecrated to devotional exerci&s;es; it is their little chapel; and thither, with each returning morning, and &s;ucceeding evening, the individuals of this happy family collect, to do homage to that Supreme Being, whom they con|&s;ider as their Creator, Redeemer, and Pre&s;erver, whom they are taught to regard as a Univer&s;al Father, and from who&s;e benevolent arrangements they confidently look for a &s;tate of the highe&s;t ultimate felicity. To their morning ori&s;ons &s;ucceed the employments of the day, and they occupy their appropriated hours.</P>
<P>It is the great bu&s;ine&s;s of Evander and Leonora, to render their children good and happy: They are them&s;elves their preceptors; and their abilities are fully adequate to this important avocation. The in|dividuals of the intere&s;ting little group, without an exception, evince an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for knowledge; and, as each valuable propen&s;ity is excited and drawn forth by their admirable parents, it will readily be conceived, that their education advances with propor|tionable celerity. They are already entered &s;tudents of nature; and, anticipating a few years, by the help of imagination, I li&s;ten to their inve&s;tigations, deriv|ing both information and plea&s;ure, while they trace the flowers which they collect in their woodland walks, to their re&s;pective cla&s;&s;es, orders, and &s;pecies. Their proficiency in mu&s;ic and drawing, their time of life con&s;idered, is prodigious. They can already &s;ketch a re&s;emblance of the land&s;cape which plea&s;es them; and never &s;hall I forget the &s;weet magic of their voic|es, whether they perform a <HI>&s;olo,</HI> or join in full con|cert: Yet, although their abilities in this way are un|que&s;tionable, they are <HI>not &s;olicitous</HI> to charm you, whether you will or not; and a degree of retiring re|luctance is &s;ufficiently manife&s;t.</P>
<P>The bu&s;tle of parade, and all tho&s;e ceremonies con|&s;equent on an o&s;tentatious di&s;play of opulence, are al|together

<P>Evander and Leonora are the common benefactors of their nece&s;&s;itous neighbours. The an&s;wer of a pea&s;|ant to a &s;tranger, inquiring who inhabited the elegant man&s;ion of Evander, will give an idea of the &s;enti|ments entertained of them by the humble tenants of the &s;oil.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I DO not know when I have &s;een a more charming evening than the la&s;t&mdash;the &s;tars &s;hone with unu&s;ual brilliancy; and the moon, in full orbed maje&s;ty, be|&s;towed on the &s;cene her highe&s;t fini&s;hing. Standing in my door, I was induced, by the delightfully im|pre&s;&s;ive &s;erenity that every where prevailed, to indulge in a contemplative ramble, which I clo&s;ed by a peep upon Margaretta, &s;hortening the di&s;tance, by turning my &s;teps to a winding path-way acro&s;s the meadows, that we have fa&s;hioned for the convenience of &s;eeing each other, with that facility which our unalterable at|tachment demands. I found that lovely woman oc|cupied in a manner truly congenial with her feelings, and completely worthy her character. She had em|ployed her afternoon in preparing letters, which &s;he propo&s;es to di&s;patch to the &s;everal emporiums in the Union, that they may be on their way to Europe and the We&s;t-Indies, for the purpo&s;e of relieving a de&s;o|late female, whom Providence has thrown under her protection.</P>
<P>On entering the parlour of my daughter, I beheld her &s;eated on a &s;ofa with an intere&s;ting &s;tranger, who was clad in deep mourning. Margaretta was endeav|ouring, in &s;trains of &s;oft commi&s;eration, to &s;oothe and tranquillize the perturbed &s;pirits of the fair afflicted, while the mingling &s;en&s;ations of grief, joy, gratitude, and admiration, apparently &s;truggling in the bo&s;om of the &s;tranger, proving too powerful for a frame that had encountered &s;evere and repeated &s;hocks of adver|&s;ity, &s;he was on the point of fainting, when Mrs. Ham|ilton, ringing for her woman, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in conducting her to an apartment, previou&s;ly appropriated, to her
<PB N="280" REF="034162_0946_0FFC5A4E9F8ADFF8">
accommodation. Wrapping my arms about me, I waited in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment for an eclairci&s;&s;ement, which I doubted not would confer additional &s;plendor on the character of my daughter. She &s;oon returned, with the de&s;ired explanation on her lips; and while &s;he recounted the &s;ub&s;tance of the following &s;orrow-marked narrative, her fine eyes were lighted up with an expre&s;&s;ion, which even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed their native lu&s;tre&mdash;the fervour of benevolence communicated to her en|chanting countenance a dazzling radiance&mdash;&s;he &s;eemed all &s;oul&mdash;and the mo&s;t &s;y&s;tematic &s;toic mu&s;t have pro|nounced her irre&s;i&s;tibly lovely.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton has thrown acro&s;s an exten&s;ive piece of ground, a gravel-walk, which he has taken much pains to level and beautify: Every day the gardener is employed in cleaning, &s;moothing and poli&s;hing its &s;urface; and, in point of order, it is not inferior to any of our public walks. It is contra&s;ted, on either hand, by enamelled lawns, cloathed with delightful verdure; and it is bordered by tall trees, who&s;e en|twining branches form a gratefully capacious &s;hade. At the bottom of this charming vi&s;ta, a gla&s;&s;y &s;tream winds its meandering cour&s;e; and its plea&s;ing mur|murs produce a romantic effect. It is &s;eparated from the grounds by a white Chine&s;e railing, and terminat|ed by a gentle acclivity, the &s;ummit of which is crown|ed with trees of various growth. This walk, which is properly the Village Mall, is entered by arched gates, and it is furni&s;hed with convenient &s;eats. Free egre&s;s and regre&s;s is allowed to the decent villager; and, as the curio&s;ity of the travelling &s;tranger fre|quently draws him thither, during the &s;pring, &s;ummer, and autumn months, a &s;ervant is &s;tationed in the Mall, who tenders cool lemonade, wine, milk, and a variety of fruits, and other light refre&s;hments, which are ea&s;i|ly prepared, and which, to the way-worn pa&s;&s;enger, are often highly acceptable.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hamilton appropriates a &s;tated period in ev|ery fine day to this enchanting walk; &s;he is generally accompanied by her children; and tho&s;e among her
<PB N="281" REF="034162_0947_0FFC5A4A9AC8BC38">
humble or nece&s;&s;itous friends, who have any petition to prefer, frequently meet her there. The morning of ye&s;terday, being remarkably mild, &s;he entered the promenade at an earlier hour than u&s;ual. William, who is a &s;entimentali&s;t from the cradle, tripped by her &s;ide. She led the little Margaretta by the hand. Mary-Augu&s;ta was borne in the arms of a ro&s;y cheeked Hebe, who particularly &s;uperintends the gambols of the children; and the tenderly intere&s;ted parent, thus pre&s;iding the guardian of innocence, &s;eemed to move a being of a &s;uperior order, while that complacency, which is the offspring of uniform goodne&s;s, manife&s;tly irradiated every feature. She had not advanced many paces, when her attention was arre&s;ted by a female, clad in the habiliments of &s;orrow, who, kneeling before one of the &s;eats, was apparently offering up her &s;uppli|cations to the common Parent of the univer&s;e. Her ge&s;tures were de&s;criptive of extreme angui&s;h of &s;pirit; and they were &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive to intere&s;t the ten|dere&s;t commi&s;eration.</P>
<P>Margaretta, directing the children to pa&s;s on, ap|proached the &s;uffering &s;tranger with that kind of cau|tious deference, and re&s;pectful veneration, with which tho&s;e, who enjoy the &s;unny beams of pro&s;perity, &s;hould uniformly regard the &s;ons and daughters of misfortune. Far from interrupting the rites of devotion, &s;he &s;pon|taneou&s;ly rai&s;ed her hands and eyes to heaven, by a &s;ilent ejaculation calling down from thence, that ben|ediction which might inve&s;t the pro&s;trate mourner with returning peace. It was in this moment of affecting &s;ympathy, that the truly intere&s;ting &s;upplicant, quit|ting, with heart piercing &s;ighs, her kneeling po&s;ture, turned &s;uddenly round, and beholding Margaretta in the pious attitude of petitioning the Omnipotent Cre|ator, a crim&s;on hue &s;uffu&s;ed her grief-worn counte|nance, which was immediately &s;ucceeded by a death|like palene&s;s.</P>
<P>Margaretta re&s;pectfully &s;eated the trembling un|known, and placing her&s;elf be&s;ide her, addre&s;&s;ed her in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> language of con&s;olation. The &s;tran|ger,
<PB N="282" REF="034162_0948_0FFC5A47A0F47E30">
after gazing with fixed a&s;toni&s;hment, at length in|terrupted&mdash;"Ah! Madam, I cannot be mi&s;taken&mdash;your figure, your features, and, above all, your peace-&s;peaking and highly &s;oothing accents, all combine to announce you: The world cannot have produced &s;uch another. You are, you mu&s;t be, Mrs. Hamilton! Two miles from B&mdash;, I was told, the angel re&s;ided; and, impelled by nece&s;&s;ity, I have mea&s;ured my weary &s;teps to this abode. Speak, dear lady&mdash;Are you not, indeed, that Margaretta Hamilton, who is &s;o well known to the family of the unfortunate?" "My name is Margaretta Hamilton, Madam," replied my daughter, "but I cannot but wonder, by what chance it is rendered familiar to you!" "Excellent lady!" rejoined the &s;tranger, "the trump of fame is li&s;ted on high; and it faileth not to proclaim tho&s;e meritorious votaries of virtue, who&s;e deeds of worth, regi&s;tered in immortal annals, confer an elevation, <HI>which will en|dure, when every earth-born plea&s;ure may be engulphed in oblivion!</HI>"</P>
<P>Margaretta, bowing, ob&s;erved that, to whatever ac|cident &s;he might owe the pre&s;ent addre&s;s, &s;he &s;hould certainly feel it incumbent upon her, to call into action every effort, which might contribute to the relief of a per&s;on, apparently &s;o deep a &s;ufferer, and that &s;he only waited to learn her wi&s;hes, in order to engage in the mo&s;t prompt execution thereof. The &s;tranger, now cla&s;ping her hands, with a wild air exclaimed: "Ge|nius of benevolence! my &s;pirit pro&s;trates before thee!&mdash;Yes, Madam, my name is Wretchedne&s;s! Fortune, family, hu&s;band, children&mdash;the&s;e are all buried beneath the waves of calamity! That little parcel," pointing to an enfolded handkerchief &s;he had thrown on an ad|joining &s;eat, "contains my whole of worldly prop|erty! I &s;lept la&s;t night in an apartment, which is no longer mine; and I have not, now, where to lay my head!"</P>
<P>Previous to this exclamation, the children had join|ed their mother; and little William, in the true &s;pirit of infantile philanthropy, catching the falling hand
<PB N="283" REF="034162_0949_0FFC5A44879D8A08">
of the pity-moving &s;tranger, &s;obbed out: "You &s;hall go home with mamma, Madam&mdash;papa will love you, too&mdash;and you &s;hall &s;it in my chair&mdash;and when night comes again, and you are tired, you &s;hall lay down on little William's bed, and we will &s;leep to|gether&mdash;Shall we not, mamma?"</P>
<P>The children of Margaretta, accu&s;tomed to a con|&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;trangers, never &s;hrink from a new face; and the charming &s;en&s;ibility, which the little fellow &s;o properly evinced, communicated to the bo|&s;om of his mother, tho&s;e rapt &s;en&s;ations that di&s;dain the garb of language. The fair unfortunate dropt upon his lovely face the tear of &s;ilent admiration; and Margaretta, after cla&s;ping him to her heart, and enriching him with her maternal benediction, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him and his &s;i&s;ters, bidding them expect a continuation of their walk at the clo&s;e of day&mdash;when, turning to the weeping mourner, &s;he thus addre&s;&s;ed her: "And now, Madam, you may, without interruption, pour into my ear the tale of woe, which my foreboding heart a&s;&s;ures me, the catalogue of your &s;ufferings will unfold."</P>
<Q><P>"Uniform benignity," replied the fair unknown, will never con&s;ider the child of &s;orrow as an intrud|er; and, to the patient hearing of benevolence, the pre&s;&s;ure of calamity is a &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;port. I have &s;ought you, Madam, on purpo&s;e to lay before you my &s;ituation, to &s;upplicate your advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, the better to entitle my&s;elf thereto, I will briefly narrate the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tances of my life. I have, I ble&s;s God, no &s;cenes of guilt to unfold, although I have &s;ometimes thought that, too much elated by pro&s;perity, the arrogance of my elevation may have placed in my hands the chalice of affliction.</P>
<P>I was born in Belfa&s;t, in Ireland. My father is, or <HI>was,</HI> a di&s;tiller of &s;ome eminence; and his indu&s;try and frugality placed his family in a &s;ituation, which, without doing any great violence to language, may be termed affluent. I had the misfortune to lo&s;e my mother while young; and the indulgence to which &s;he had accu&s;tomed me, rendered that cold re&s;erve, and
<PB N="284" REF="034162_0950_0FFC5A4305CAF0D0">
tho&s;e re&s;traints that were perhaps nece&s;&s;ary, and to which I was almo&s;t immediately &s;ubjected, painfully irk&s;ome. Girls naturally &s;hrink from the control of a &s;tep-mother; and, although I have known many wor|thy women, who have meritoriou&s;ly di&s;charged the ar|duous duties of that department, yet the odium, too generally affixed to the character, is not e&s;&s;entially di|mini&s;hed. For me, I gladly availed my&s;elf of the goodne&s;s of my father, who placed a boarding-&s;chool education in my option; and I was entru&s;ted to the care of two re&s;pectable maiden ladies, who had long been in the habit of in&s;tructing young girls.</P>
<P>In this &s;eminary, while no genteel accompli&s;hment was neglected, the pupils were required to prepare for them&s;elves every article of their apparel: Our judi|cious preceptre&s;&s;es ob&s;erving that, if the contingencies of life reduced us to the nece&s;&s;ity of calling into ac|tion any extraordinary exertions, re&s;ources would thus be multiplied, and that, even on the &s;uppo&s;ition, we were adopted into the family of pro&s;perity, u&s;eful knowledge would never impede our advancement. Often have I ble&s;&s;ed the provident care of the&s;e ven|erable women: The habits of economy and indu&s;try, to which they accu&s;tomed me, at all times beneficial, have lately proved my only &s;upport.</P>
<P>At fourteen, I returned to the abode of my father, where I continued until I had completed my &s;even|teenth year; at which period my &s;i&s;ter wedded Mr. James L&mdash;r, a portrait painter, of con&s;iderable abili|ties, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a plantation in St. Chri&s;topher's, to which i&s;land &s;he agreed to accompany him. My two brothers, and two of my maternal uncles, having long meditated a &s;ettlement in America, embraced this op|portunity of putting their plan in execution; and I could not re&s;i&s;t the inducement which &s;o fair an occa|&s;ion furni&s;hed, of reputably freeing my&s;elf from the juri&s;diction of an a&s;&s;uming and petulant woman. I petitioned my beloved father, for leave to accompany the individuals of our family, who were about to de|part; and &s;uch was the mildne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="285" REF="034162_0951_0FFC5A3BF06CD1F0">
that it was with difficulty he ever put a negative on the wi&s;hes of his children: Yet he affectionately re|mon&s;trated, until, on my a&s;&s;uring him, that after vi&s;it|ing the new world I would again return to his em|braces, he conde&s;cended to withdraw his objections, and be&s;towed upon me a benediction, which was as the riche&s;t trea&s;ure to my &s;oul.</P>
<P>We left Ireland immediately on the clo&s;e of that war, which emancipated the United States from the domination of Great-Britain, and after a propitious pa&s;&s;age, we landed in Maryland. Here our family &s;eparated. My &s;i&s;ter accompanied her hu&s;band to St. Chri&s;topher's. One of my uncles, attended by my younge&s;t brother, accepted an advantageous offer of vi&s;iting Portugal, where, it is probable, they are now doing bu&s;ine&s;s; and my other uncle, di&s;&s;atisfied with his &s;ituation, departed from us with an avowed inten|tion of purcha&s;ing an inheritance in the Northern States. My elde&s;t brother took a hou&s;e in Maryland, the &s;uperintendence of which he committed to me; and our days pa&s;&s;ed on in tolerable tranquillity. My brother contracted an acquaintance with &s;everal gen|tlemen in Penn&s;ylvania; and, vi&s;iting Philadelphia, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome happy days in that metropolis.</P>
<P>It was on our return to Maryland, that I fir&s;t &s;aw Doctor M&mdash;, a young man, who appeared to me po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every virtue. His extraction was French; but he &s;poke Engli&s;h with facility. He had &s;tudied phy&s;ic with Doctor&mdash;of Philadelphia; and he was then commencing the career of life, under the au&s;pices of a good under&s;tanding, much information, &s;ome property, and great benevolence of heart. His atten|tions to me were marked by the tendere&s;t a&s;&s;iduities, and my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour augmented with every pa&s;ting moment. Dear object of my &s;oul's be&s;t affection! how is it that I endure a world, from which, alas! thou art forever flown?&mdash;But peace, my burn|ing heart&mdash;yet a little while, and I &s;hall forget to weep&mdash;I &s;hall rejoin, in regions of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, him, to whom my early vows were &s;o rapturou&s;ly devoted!</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="034162_0952_0FFC5A3A3B859068">
Doctor M&mdash;, Madam, &s;olicited my hand in marriage; and my brother, availing him&s;elf of the authority delegated to him by my father, conferred upon our mutual attachment the fulle&s;t &s;anction. My lover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed grounds in Cape Francois. It was his determination to enter into bu&s;ine&s;s at the Cape; and my brother had long contemplated a removal thither. We were &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;hed at Cape Francois; and our nuptials were not long delayed; after which, my brother, urged by motives of intere&s;t, once more changed his re&s;idence for a &s;ituation in St. Vincent's.</P>
<P>Yet, although our family party was thus &s;trangely di&s;per&s;ed, my hu&s;band continued the a&s;&s;iduities of the lover. My father had written to us; and, be&s;towing upon our union the mo&s;t unequivocal approbation, he enriched us with his paternal ble&s;&s;ing, and I e&s;teemed my&s;elf the happie&s;t of women. Doctor M&mdash;, emi|nent in his profe&s;&s;ion, was &s;ucce&s;sful beyond our mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes: The birth of children crowned our wi&s;hes; and three promi&s;ing girls &s;eemed to complete, for me, my &s;um of joy. My &s;i&s;ter L&mdash;r was not &s;o happy as to become a mother; and with much reluc|tance I yielded, to her frequent importunities, my fir&s;t pledge of love. I parted with my dear Amelia with floods of tears; and &s;he accompanied her uncle L&mdash;r to the I&s;land of St. Chri&s;topher's. Alas! the&s;e eyes have never &s;ince beheld her; and I am ignorant if either &s;he or my &s;i&s;ter are yet in exi&s;tence! Imme|diately on her departure, the troubles in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands commenced. A friend, driven from her hab|itation, &s;ought and obtained &s;helter with us. She had not been many days our inmate, when &s;he was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox. Neither my&s;elf, nor my children, had ever pa&s;&s;ed through that fatal di&s;order&mdash;&s;he con|tagion was communicated&mdash;I was brought to the verge of the grave&mdash;and my babes&mdash;my darling babes&mdash;became the victims of the de&s;poiler! Yet, I ble&s;s thee, O my Redeemer! on their behalf; for, &s;heltered in the bo&s;om of their God, they thus e&s;caped the di&s;|a&s;trous fate, for which their haple&s;s parents were re|&s;erved!
<PB N="287" REF="034162_0953_0FFC5A38B9B4C420">
I mourned over the early graves of my in|fants; but my dear, my affectionate hu&s;band was continued to me; and, although the &s;mall-pox had made &s;hocking ravages in my face, his tenderne&s;s was in no &s;ort dimini&s;hed, and his delicate attentions were, if po&s;&s;ible, more marked, more uniform than before. Generous lover! friend! hu&s;band!&mdash;But, great and good God! he is now numbered with the dead! while I, comfortle&s;s and forlorn, can only recount the &s;tory of my woes, and wi&s;h, in vain, for that parting &s;igh, which is to waft me from this &s;cene of wretch|edne&s;s!</P>
<P>Forgive me, Madam&mdash;I will re&s;ume my narra|tion. Months rolled on; and when, u&s;hering into being my fourth infant, I became the mother of a lovely boy, joy once more revi&s;ited my lacerated bo|&s;om&mdash;but tran&s;ient and momentary was the gleam. Upon the very evening on which my little cherub had completed his third week, after folding him to my throbbing heart, I committed him to the care of his nur&s;e&mdash;&s;he conveyed him to his apartment&mdash;and I &s;aw him no more! Doubtle&s;s, he peri&s;hed in the gen|eral wreck! It was midnight, when the blacks ru&s;h|ed on us&mdash;every thing was rifled&mdash;My hu&s;band, my adored hu&s;band, was murdered in attempting to de|fend me!&mdash;and the &s;word was pointed at my bo&s;om al&s;o! At &s;uch a cri&s;is, it is a&s;toni&s;hing that I recog|nized the very man whom I had employed as my hair-dre&s;&s;er, and whom I had repeatedly re&s;cued from &s;uffering. Coward nature, appalled at the fearful car|nage, mechanically exclaimed&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible? Am I to receive the &s;troke of death from him, who is in|debted to me for unnumbered acts of kindne&s;s? The barbarian was &s;truck with a &s;entiment of remor&s;e&mdash;he manife&s;ted a de&s;ire to &s;ave me&mdash;and while he a&s;|&s;ayed to lift me over the dead body of my murdered lord, I fainted in his arms.</P>
<P>Of events immediately &s;ucceeding I am ignorant. My fir&s;t recollection, after this tremendous moment, places me on the wide ocean&mdash;in the cabin of a ve&s;&s;el
<PB N="288" REF="034162_0954_0FFC5A3025AF4338">
&mdash;&s;tretched on the captain's matra&s;s, who had hu|manely yielded it to my nece&s;&s;ities&mdash;and &s;urrounded by &s;trangers of both &s;exes, who, like me, had e&s;caped the dagger of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. How I came on board, I could never exactly learn. The probability is, that the black man &s;o far intere&s;ted him&s;elf for my &s;afety, as to &s;ee me conveyed out of the i&s;land; and it is won|derful, that although I was only arrayed in the <HI>robe de chambre</HI> in which I &s;lept, my watch, bracelets, neck|lace, and rings, were found upon me: But ah! Mad|am, at that &s;oul-torturing period, what was the an|gui&s;h of my &s;pirit! Stripped in one calamitous night&mdash;But why attempt to delineate?&mdash;my &s;orrows do indeed &s;urpa&s;s the power of de&s;cription! From the pa&s;&s;engers and the &s;hip's company, I am induced to believe, I received every po&s;&s;ible attention: But my rea&s;on &s;u&s;pending its operations, I was landed in Alex|andria, in Virginia, in a &s;tate of in&s;anity!</P>
<P>For five months after my arrival in America, I continued without the &s;malle&s;t recollection of my former &s;elf. My alienation of mind was, as I am told, of the mo&s;t heart-affecting kind; and my lamentations were only interrupted by that laugh of frenzy, which is deeply fraught with woe, and which &s;trongly inte|re&s;ts the feelings of humanity. No lucid interval pre|&s;ented; and I was pronounced a confirmed maniac. Youth, however, and a good con&s;titution, at length &s;urmounted my malady, and I was gradually re&s;tored to a recollection of that extremity of wretchedne&s;s which I had endured. It was at this period, that I deliberately meditated putting an end to a mode of exi&s;tence, which had become truly burden&s;ome; and it is to be imputed to the benevolent exertions of a Mrs. THOMPSON of Alexandria, that I &s;unk not be|neath the weight of woes, which had &s;o fearfully ac|cumulated for my de&s;truction. The extricating hand of this lady was benignly extended; &s;he poured into my wounded mind the oil and wine of con&s;olation; &s;he new pointed my hopes, and taught me to ob&s;erve an opening heaven, and a commi&s;erating God; nor

were her well-judged efforts to &s;oothe and tranquillize my bo&s;om, altogether ineffectual.</P>
<P>I recollected, in the fir&s;t moment of calm reflec|tion, having heard in the We&s;t-Indies, that my uncle had purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate in B&mdash;; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an invincible de&s;ire to throw my&s;elf into the protection of &s;ome one of my family, (the individuals of which, mu&s;t, to this hour, imagine I &s;uffered death in Cape Francois) I formed the re&s;olution of immediately pro|ceeding to my uncle; and parting with tho&s;e ve&s;|tiges of my former &s;plendor, which had been almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly &s;aved from the wreck of my fortune, with the money ari&s;ing from the &s;ale, I equipt my&s;elf for the commencement of a journey, which my igno|rance in the geography of the country induced me to imagine, a day or two would terminate. It proved, however, to a de&s;olate and forlorn &s;tranger, a tedious period, the glooms of which were only illumined by the hope of &s;oon finding my&s;elf in the arms of an af|fectionate relative. Detained in New-Haven by ill|ne&s;s, I am largely indebted to a Mrs. BROWN, who lets lodgings in that city, and who&s;e di&s;intere&s;ted be|nevolence is beyond all prai&s;e. What &s;hall I &s;ay, Madam? I came on to B&mdash;. My little money (for my jewels were di&s;po&s;ed of, much below their value) was exhau&s;ted. No tender friend remained to receive me. My uncle had never been heard of at B&mdash;. I was pennyle&s;s, and a &s;tranger! For &s;ome fearful days my efforts became pro&s;trate! De&s;pair, with ha&s;ty &s;trides, was advancing in my bo&s;om; yet hope &s;till &s;truggled there; and, &s;trange to tell, I &s;till continued in exi&s;tence!</P>
<P>The Hibernian Society intere&s;ted it&s;elf in my fa|vour; and from them, and from the Free Ma&s;ons, I received &s;mall gratuities: But my mind, not &s;ufficient|ly accommodated to its &s;ituation, &s;hrunk from the idea of le&s;&s;ening the fund re&s;erved for di&s;tre&s;&s;ed indigence; and, moreover, a continuance of the&s;e benefits was as little to be calculated upon, as endured. My applica|to the French and Engli&s;h re&s;idents in B&mdash;was in|effectual;
<PB N="290" REF="034162_0956_0FFC5A2D1AD24D70">
they declared it was beyond their power to relieve me. I had hoped, through their interpo&s;ition, to return to Ireland, where I am entitled to an e&s;tate, independent of my father, devi&s;ed to me by my grand|mother; and my patrimonial inheritance I have &s;till to receive. Could I reach Ireland, my pecuniary wants would know an end; but this I have not the means of doing. I have attempted to write; but, de&s;olate as I am, I have no means of conveying my lamentable epi&s;tles. I have endeavoured to obtain &s;upport by my needle, and I have, in a mea&s;ure, &s;uc|ceeded; but ill health impedes my efforts. To your character, Madam, I am no &s;tranger. Some propi|tious &s;pirit &s;eemed to whi&s;per me, that from you I &s;hould meet commi&s;eration and relief. From your name, from your virtues, my la&s;t hope receives its vi|tal glow; and towards Hamilton-Place, as my only re&s;ource, my feet have involuntarily bent their way.</P></Q>
<P>Such was the <HI>purport</HI> of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed lady's affecting narrative. I have &s;crupulou&s;ly pre&s;erved its leading features.

<P>THE mazy dance, the fe&s;tive &s;ong, the table lib|erally &s;pread, the well filled bowl, and &s;parkling gla&s;s&mdash;the&s;e are all in the gift of Ho&s;pitality: Nay, more, FRIENDSHIP re&s;ideth in her haunts, and VIRTUE loveth to dwell in her pre&s;ence: The &s;ocial plea&s;ures weave a chaplet for her brow; and &s;he may be con|&s;idered as the parent of communicative urbanity. Plea&s;ant is the fea&s;t which &s;he &s;preadeth for the &s;tran|ger. She looketh with peculiar benignity upon him, who, wandering far di&s;tant from his native abode, hath been urged forward, either by motives of curio&s;|ity, amu&s;ement, or profit; and the exhau&s;ted travel|ler, having repo&s;ed on the bed of down, ari&s;eth from the &s;lumbers of the night, to echo the panegyric which hath been re&s;ounded by a thou&s;and tongues.</P>
<P>The State of Virginia, we are informed, is cla&s;&s;ed high in the records of Ho&s;pitality. Its exten&s;ive boundaries contain many towns and hamlets; and the commodious villas are &s;cattered up and down at ea&s;y
<PB N="292" REF="034162_0958_0FFC5A23DEE77408">
di&s;tances. To the feet of the traveller the&s;e villas are well known&mdash;they are the man&s;ions of Ho&s;pitality. Often have we attended, with &s;uperior plea&s;ure, to our very amiable friend, Mrs. J&mdash;of Philadelphia, while &s;he hath dilated on the Ho&s;pitality of the Virginians. The bo&s;om of this lady is the &s;eat of the virtues; and it is her's to expatiate, with enchanting energy, on the deed of worth. She is a beautiful and a lovely wo|man; and her features, animated by &s;en&s;ibility, are irre&s;i&s;tibly captivating. She is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of afflu|ence; but gold, in a &s;cattered and thinly inhabited country, will not always purcha&s;e tho&s;e requi&s;ites, which are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the traveller, worn down by fatigue, and exhau&s;ted in the want of refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>Mrs J&mdash;accompanied her hu&s;band on a tour of bu&s;ine&s;s, through the State of Virginia; and her tongue will never be tired of eulogizing tho&s;e ho&s;pita|ble republicans. Born and educated in the regular city of Philadelphia, where previous knowledge, let|ters of introduction, or many weeks probationary re&s;i|dence, mu&s;t authorize the claim of attention, the frank civilities, and prompt Ho&s;pitality of the Virginians, added to their intrin&s;ic worth the powerful charm of novelty.</P>
<P>Virginian Ho&s;pitality hath &s;uper&s;eded the nece&s;&s;ity of hou&s;es of public entertainment. The occupation of an inn-keeper is, in that State, very unprofitable. A public hou&s;e is, therefore, rarely to be met with, and they are generally of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s. Our Philadelphians do not &s;eem to have been perfectly ap|prized of this circum&s;tance, or, if they were, it had not been in their power to provide again&s;t its incon|venience. They entered the State of Virginia, unfur|ni&s;hed with letters of introduction; and their fir&s;t day's progre&s;s was lengthened, tedious, and de&s;titute of tho&s;e refre&s;hments, which their nece&s;&s;ities urgently demanded. Night rapidly advanced&mdash;already her ebon veil ob&s;cured the light of heaven&mdash;they were ig|norant of their route, and entire &s;trangers in that part of the country&mdash;A foot pa&s;&s;enger approached&mdash;

Plenty and elegance combined to &s;pread the fea&s;t. Their lodging was prepared by ta&s;te and neat|ne&s;s; and their re&s;t was balmy and re&s;torative. COLONEL CHICHISTER urged their abode with him, during many revolving days; and, con&s;tantly engaged in the exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t liberal and exten&s;ive Ho&s;|pitality, he &s;eemed uncon&s;cious of any extraordinary

<P>Surely, every propen&s;ity, calculated to give energy to an attachment which ought to pervade the bo&s;oms of individuals who date their origin from the &s;ame progenitors, &s;hould be &s;edulou&s;ly cultivated; a mutual exchange of good offices &s;hould de&s;ignate humanity, and the powerful operations of &s;ympathy enzone the great family of man. Such an ameliorating arrange|ment would largely contribute toward le&s;&s;ening the evils attendant on that depravity, which has &s;o fatally contaminated our common nature, and we &s;hould not be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of lamenting the prevalence of invidious re&s;erve, envy and rancour.</P>

<P>YES, good Ma&s;ter Gleaner, we are now no longer <HI>a-ground.</HI> You &s;o well lent us a hand, <HI>d'ye &s;ee,</HI> that we &s;oon <HI>cleared the ra&s;cally &s;ands;</HI> and, <HI>warping</HI> off, and &s;lowly <HI>wearing</HI> round, we were once more afloat on the &s;tream&mdash;not but what the wind was often in <HI>our muns;</HI> and after <HI>beating in its eye</HI> ever &s;o long, we were obliged to <HI>&s;trike a hull,</HI> during many a tedious watch: But what of that?&mdash;it hath at length <HI>veered</HI> about to the right point of the compa&s;s; we have <HI>weathered the &s;hoals of Di&s;appointment;</HI> and, I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma&s;ter Gleaner, on the word of a tough old &s;eaman, that, having &s;hipped a large cargo of your experience, to|gether with the balla&s;t of your remarks and advice, <HI>and all that there,</HI> we once more bear a good &s;ail.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, we have now got the <HI>weather-gage</HI> of &s;or|row; nor do we care a <HI>rope's end</HI> for what is pa&s;t. Molly took on piteou&s;ly over the poor <HI>di&s;abled</HI> Lavinia; but &s;uddenly <HI>tacking</HI> about, &s;he wiped up her eyes, and throwing open her <HI>dead lights, clapped Pride at the helm,</HI> who, <HI>d'ye &s;ee,</HI> &s;oon &s;teered her wide of the harbour of De&s;pair. It would certainly have been cowardly for to have laid up for life, becau&s;e <HI>as how</HI> we had made one bad bout; and to continue in the dumps all the voyage, and all for the &s;ake of a villainous lubber, who had given us the &s;lip, would have been a plaguy deal wor&s;e than a dead calm: Molly thought &s;o too; and after whimpering a long time, at length, as I was &s;ay|ing, re&s;olved for to &s;teer by your compa&s;s; and taking in her <HI>drifted</HI> affections, &s;he &s;oon <HI>belayed</HI> them along &s;ide of di&s;cretion, and <HI>&s;plicing</HI> them to a good jolly temper, we obtained a <HI>&s;tiff gale,</HI> and, as I &s;aid, <HI>weath|ering the breakers,</HI> our girl became her own woman again.</P>
<P>After this, Ma&s;ter Gleaner, we <HI>&s;hipped a mate,</HI> who, under&s;tanding every rope in the &s;hip, is quite to our

<P>Deborah, <HI>d'ye &s;ee,</HI> would have clapped the whole ac|count of our former &s;park, <HI>and all that there matter, under the hatches:</HI> But <HI>ava&s;t there, &s;ays I,</HI> none of your hugger-mugger &s;muggling doings for me&mdash;all fair and above board, &s;ays I&mdash;and &s;o I &s;et my&s;elf about <HI>unquoil|ing</HI> the whole &s;ecret; and the young man was not &s;o &s;queami&s;h a milk-&s;op, as to like us a <HI>rope's end</HI> the wor&s;e, for all that.</P>
<P>We have lately heard, how that our old comrade has been <HI>overhauled</HI> by a &s;mart &s;ea-boat, who, throwing on board her <HI>grappling-irons,</HI> has made him a pri&s;oner for life; and it is &s;aid, that he will hardly hold his head above water again: But how&s;omever this be, our Molly is to be married this very day &s;e'nnight; and I, having received <HI>&s;hipping orders,</HI> this here letter is to <HI>pipe all hands</HI> (your good woman, and all your family&mdash;the Melworths, Hamiltons, Seymours, <HI>and all them there</HI>) to the wedding.

<P>IT is matter of wonder, that you, who profe&s;s &s;uch an attachment to your country, &s;hould, in your chap|ter upon the progre&s;s of uneducated genius, have quite forgotten to enumerate a number of your countrymen, who&s;e preten&s;ions in this line are indi&s;putable.</P>
<P>Mr. W&mdash;, one of the mo&s;t celebrated painters now flouri&s;hing in Europe, is the fir&s;t upon this li&s;t. His father, an hone&s;t Quaker in Penn&s;ylvania, had fol|lowed the occupation of a cooper, by which he had obtained a frugal &s;upport for his family. His inten|tion was to confine his &s;on Benjamin to the adze; and the education which he gave him was &s;uited to this view: But the per&s;everance of genius being generally
<PB N="299" REF="034162_0965_0FFC5A14B726E968">
indefatigable, young Benjamin's chalk-&s;trokes were oftener ob&s;erved to &s;ketch the <HI>human face divine,</HI> than to trace profe&s;&s;ional circles; and he performed &s;uch exploits, as excited the admiration of the whole village where he re&s;ided.</P>
<P>The&s;e manife&s;tations gave his father much concern, and he &s;eriou&s;ly remon&s;trated again&s;t them: "Benja|min, I charge thee to de&s;i&s;t. I tell thee, Benjamin, thou art in the road to ruin; and if thou continue&s;t therein, <HI>verily, verily, thou wilt be a vagabond. I mu&s;t &s;mite thee, Benjamin, if thou do&s;t not leave the&s;e profane fooleries, and apply thy&s;elf to thy bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI>"</P>
<P>Benjamin endeavoured to &s;ubmit to authority; but the fire of genius was not to be controlled; and a neighbour opening a public hou&s;e, he undertook, on condition that he would provide the materials, and keep his &s;ecret, to paint him a &s;ign. His lei&s;ure hours &s;oon performed his promi&s;e; and it was exhibited with great triumph. In a country village, an event of this kind is prodigious; and the villagers collect|ed, not to critici&s;e, but to wonder, and to applaud: Among the re&s;t, the father of Benjamin pre&s;ented him&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>"And pray, friend, where did&s;t thou pick up this famous piece of bu&s;ine&s;s?"</P>
<P>"If I dared to tell you, Sir&mdash;<HI>if I was &s;ure it would not di&s;plea&s;e you</HI>&mdash;"</P>
<P>"<HI>Nay, nay, friend&mdash;Pray, why &s;hould&s;t thou think it would vex me?</HI> Verily, thou ha&s;t excited my wonder; and I mu&s;t entreat thee to explain thy meaning."</P>
<P>"<HI>But thou wilt be angry with Benjamin.</HI>"</P>
<P>This was enough&mdash;the &s;ecret was out. The old gentleman was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed; and, rationally concluding, that it was in vain to &s;truggle any longer again&s;t the unequivocal deci&s;ion of nature, he advi&s;ed Benjamin to depart for the great city, Philadelphia, and there &s;et up the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ign-painting. The lad, not waiting for a repetition of this advice, took a ha&s;ty leave of his native village; and, proceeding to Philadelphia, his uncommon merit drew upon him
<PB N="300" REF="034162_0966_0FFC6219CEA6B3B0">
general attention. His &s;ucce&s;s exceeded his mo&s;t &s;an|guine expectations; and he &s;peedily embarked, with &s;trong recommendatory letters, for England, where the rapid progre&s;s which he has made, is well known to all tho&s;e who have the &s;malle&s;t acquaintance with the hi&s;tory of the fine arts.</P>
<P>You are, Mr. Gleaner, advi&s;ed to collect carefully, every in&s;tance of indigenous talents which falls in your way; and, as corre&s;ponding &s;ecretary to the fraterni|ty, embodied for the purpo&s;e of promoting emula|tion, I promi&s;e you all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which we can command.</P>

annual round may the &s;tars of heaven glitter with un|u&s;ual lu&s;tre, and may it ri&s;e on my memory, the &s;plen|did epoch of my emancipation from tenfold darkne&s;s. The volume, which your &s;econd vi&s;it be&s;towed upon me&mdash;alas! why was I &s;o long a &s;tranger to that vol|ume?&mdash;it is a trea&s;ure beyond all price. The beautiful &s;implicity of its language, and rich variety of its im|agery&mdash;the&s;e, while they embelli&s;h, are, however, to be regarded as the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable part of its worth. How &s;ublime is its &s;y&s;tem of ethics! and how <HI>noble the forgivene&s;s of injuries which it inculcates!</HI> Ju&s;tly is it called the book of God; for to it is communicated the powers of <HI>re&s;toration.</HI> Before its refulgent blaze my malignant pa&s;&s;ions pro&s;trate, my re&s;entments are all &s;ubdued, and I am again alive to that divine philan|thropy, which enkindles in my bo&s;om the be&s;t feelings of the heart.</P>
<P>What a con&s;i&s;tent whole does this &s;acred book pre|&s;ent! It di&s;plays the Omnipotent Creator, as ruling the univer&s;e according to his righteous plea&s;ure; as calling into exi&s;tence a nature, formed by his omnific word, and pur&s;uing a path which his <HI>wi&s;dom foreknew.</HI> It exhibits this nature under a cloud, and &s;ubjected, <HI>for rea&s;ons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t known to paternal Deity,</HI> to a variety of er|rors. It points to that au&s;picious era, when our nature, emerging from the thick darkne&s;s by which it was en|veloped, &s;hone forth in primeval &s;plendor. It di&s;plays before my a&s;toni&s;hed view, <HI>God the Creator becoming God the Redeemer;</HI> and, hurrying me rapidly along through numerous intervening events, it unveils to my enrap|tured perception, the final con&s;ummation of that augu&s;t plan, the influence of which pervadeth every divi&s;ion of time. It exhibits the period, when crimes in their va|riety &s;hall be blotted from the univer&s;e; <HI>when what we have characterized as evil, &s;hall &s;erve to point and enhance the &s;ucceeding good;</HI> when rectitude &s;hall be enthroned in every bo&s;om, innocence triumphant, and peace e&s;|tabli&s;hed throughout the wide dominions of the great Source of being.

<OPENER><SALUTE>RESPECTED SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GOOD minds are repre&s;ented as viewing, with be|nign complacency, the man, who, renouncing his er|rors of principle, or of practice, enters with firmne&s;s the path of rectitude; and, under a per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of this &s;entiment, I pre&s;ume to addre&s;s you, in|dulging a hope, that, not having be&s;towed a final malediction on that Alphon&s;o, with whom you were &s;o righteou&s;ly offended, you will countenance the en|gagements which he is about to form, and permit him to rank among tho&s;e whom you direct by your coun|cil, and &s;anction by your approbation.</P>
<P>But, that I may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, authorize my claim to your attention, I take leave to ob&s;erve, that the lovely woman who&s;e wrongs excited your indigna|tion, is now <HI>perfectly re&s;tored to rea&s;on;</HI> and, that &s;he may exemplify every benign attribute of divinity, &s;he hath extended unto the man who hath &s;o deeply in|jured her, <HI>free</HI> and unre&s;erved forgivene&s;s. Her ven|erable parent, too, lending a conde&s;cending ear to my &s;upplications, be&s;tows on my ardent vows her maternal benediction; and, for my&s;elf, when I &s;ay, that my &s;um of happine&s;s exceeds the angui&s;h by which it was preceded, I cannot give it a higher colouring. As it is to you, Sir, that I am principally indebted for both, I con&s;ider it incumbent on me to pre&s;ent you with a brief narration of facts, which may, in &s;ome de|gree, palliate errors, otherwi&s;e enormous.</P>
<P>My father, departing this life, while I was yet an infant, I was left wholly under the care of my mother; and, as &s;he had no other child, &s;he <HI>literally</HI> devoted the remainder of her life to her &s;on&mdash;&s;he con&s;ulted me in
<PB N="304" REF="034162_0970_0FFC6210A66A9840">
every thing; and &s;he carried her blameable indulgence to a mo&s;t extravagant height. All per&s;ons who have made the early part of exi&s;tence, in any &s;ort, their &s;tudy, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved the marked attachment which children uniformly di&s;cover to novelty. This propen&s;ity in me was gratified in every po&s;&s;ible way; my diet, my apartment, and even my preceptors, were changed agreeably to the infantile caprice of the mo|ment; and thus a kind of artificial incon&s;tancy was grafted upon a wayward humour, which &s;hould have been corrected; and I was rendered <HI>habitually irre&s;olute.</HI> Had I not been fond of my book, I &s;hould have reach|ed manhood de&s;titute of information; but nature, in many particulars, &s;truggled again&s;t the ill-judged ten|derne&s;s of my mother, who was, in every other in&s;tance, the be&s;t and mo&s;t rational of women. Her demi&s;e happened &s;oon after I had reached maturity; and the indeci&s;ion of di&s;po&s;ition, which had been &s;o erroneou&s;|ly cultivated, was in nothing more manife&s;t, than in the fluctuation of my mind, re&s;pecting my matrimonial election. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of amiable females alternately triumphed in my bo&s;om, until Lavinia, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing every other object, became the &s;overeign lady of my affections.</P>
<P>From a per&s;on &s;o completely calculated to in&s;pire love and perfect e&s;teem, it could &s;carcely be imagin|ed my heart could ever wander; yet, my uncertainty, in this re&s;pect, &s;u&s;pended a declaration which, never|thele&s;s, the ardour of my attachment &s;pontaneou&s;ly dictated. I had not, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, formed a plan to de&s;troy the peace of my beloved Lavinia; and the truth is, that, although I entertained a hope of being able to incline her, by my continued a&s;&s;iduities, to au|thorize my preten&s;ions, yet, &s;uch was the con&s;ummate prudence of her conduct, that, while I was permitted to view her as my <HI>tender friend,</HI> I never once conceived, that an avowal of my love was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary to her tran|quillity.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was I circum&s;tanced, when the ver&s;atility of my humour once more gained the a&s;cendency; and I
<PB N="305" REF="034162_0971_0FFC620E75975C40">
coolly relinqui&s;hed a pur&s;uit, in which I had &s;o warm|ly engaged. My attachment to Monimia was &s;hort-lived; every interview convinced me of her inferiority to the accompli&s;hed woman I had abandoned; &s;he was by nature a coquette; and the <HI>hauteur</HI> of her tem|per was in&s;ufferable. Ab&s;ence from Lavinia, evinced the durability of her power, and I would in&s;tantly have &s;ought her pre&s;ence, had I not believed that my coldne&s;s and neglect, had given a fatal &s;tab to that predilection with which I flattered my&s;elf &s;he once honoured me.</P>
<P>A fixed melancholy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mind; it became a matter of indifference to me in what part of the globe I wandered; and, urged by a hope of di&s;&s;i|pating the glooms in which I was enveloped, I em|braced the opportunity of embarking with a friend, for the purpo&s;e of making the tour of Europe. I had been ab&s;ent near two years, when, meeting in France with our fair countrywoman, Madam B&mdash;, who&s;e elegant <HI>Ruelle</HI> is the re&s;ort of every American who forms the lea&s;t preten&s;ion to ta&s;te; Columbian litera|ture very naturally made a part of our conver&s;ation. Madam B&mdash;put into my hands a manu&s;cript which &s;he &s;aid was to make one of a number of e&s;&s;ays, in|tended for publication; and, adding, that &s;he had but recently received it from the Author, with whom &s;he regularly corre&s;ponded, &s;he gave me permi&s;&s;ion to put it into my pocket for the amu&s;ement of a lei&s;ure hour.</P>
<P>Retiring to my lodgings, I unfolded the manu&s;cript; but no tongue can de&s;cribe my a&s;toni&s;hment, when I traced, in the character of Lavinia, the angel whom I conceived I had forever lo&s;t&mdash;when, in the delineation of Alphon&s;o, I read the &s;tory of my own highly rep|rehen&s;ible conduct! It is true, I was not con&s;cious of a <HI>de&s;ign &s;o atrocious</HI> as was imputed to me; and yet, as I contemplated the di&s;a&s;trous event of that amity which had promi&s;ed &s;o fair, the angui&s;h of my &s;pirit was inexpre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="034162_0972_0FFC620C1CD27AA0">
The ardour of my attachment to my lovely friend, was rather augmented than dimini&s;hed. Time and ob&s;ervation had confirmed my &s;entiments of her <HI>in|comparable merit;</HI> and her image was indelibly impre&s;&s;|ed on my mind.</P>
<P>With the fir&s;t opportunity, I returned to my native country. In&s;tantly I &s;ought, and pro&s;trated my&s;elf before the mother of Lavinia. She heard, believed, and pitied. I &s;aw, frequently I &s;aw, my &s;oul's trea&s;|ure: But, great and good God! how changed! On me &s;he be&s;towed not the &s;malle&s;t attention; and my mi&s;ery was complete.</P>
<P>A ble&s;&s;ed expedient, however, at length occurred to me; and, placing my&s;elf near her, during one of tho&s;e fanciful and &s;oul-piercing dialogues, which you &s;o pa|thetically repre&s;ent the dear unfortunate as holding with me, I re&s;ponded to her remarks, preci&s;ely in the manner &s;he had the day before dictated for me. An expre&s;&s;ion of extreme a&s;toni&s;hment immediately per|vaded her countenance; and, bur&s;ting into a laugh of frenzy, (no words can give an idea of the poignant angui&s;h of which that laugh was de&s;criptive) &s;he turn|ed ha&s;tily round, and, beholding the vi&s;ion which had &s;o long floated only in the region of fancy, with fold|ed arms, and a &s;tatue like appearance, &s;ub&s;tantiated before her&mdash;recollection at that moment glimmered &s;aintly on the di&s;k of rea&s;on; and, uttering a heart-piercing &s;hriek, &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s into my arms. It was with difficulty &s;he was re&s;tored to life&mdash;a bur&s;t of tears &s;ucceeded&mdash;the fir&s;t &s;he had &s;hed for many months&mdash;we ble&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the copious effu&s;ion, predicting therefrom the happie&s;t effects; No, were we di&s;appointed&mdash;gradually &s;he returned to rea&s;on, love, and her enraptured Al|phon&s;o! and hardly will the angelic &s;ufferer permit me to expre&s;s any part of that compunction, which, for a time, nearly overwhelmed me.</P>
<P>The hour which is to complete my felicity, is not far di&s;tant; and I have to entreat you, Sir, in the name of my venerable parent, in that of my beloved Lavinia, and of my own, that you would act as the

<P>I LATELY pa&s;&s;ed an evening in a large company, which unanimou&s;ly agreed, that you could not do bet|ter than to write a Gleaner on the <HI>origin and progre&s;s of evil.</HI> You are to know, that our party was much divided in their opinions on this &s;ubject: Some a&s;&s;ort|ed the <HI>eternity of evil;</HI> others in&s;i&s;ted, that, as it had a beginning, it mu&s;t undoubtedly have an end; and a third cla&s;s <HI>po&s;itively <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its exi&s;tence in any &s;hape whatever!</HI></P>
<P>A few of the arguments made u&s;e of, in defence of the latter, as the mo&s;t novel &s;entiment, I &s;hall &s;ketch for your information. A favourite line from a favour|ite poet, was exultingly introduced: "<HI>From &s;eeming
<PB N="311" REF="034162_0977_0FFC6200A9F0DCB8">
evil &s;till educing good</HI>"&mdash;and the participle <HI>&s;eeming</HI> was empha&s;ized with great energy. The advocates of this opinion deci&s;ively &s;aid, that every thing was now in the <HI>be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation;</HI> and this they inferred, not on|ly from the wi&s;dom of the great Di&s;po&s;er of events, but al&s;o from the manife&s;t inquietude produced by any &s;udden change. The cobler, unexpectedly receiving a pur&s;e of gold, &s;u&s;pended his morning and evening &s;ong; care became an inmate in that bo&s;om, once the &s;eat of tranquillity; nor was his mirth re&s;tored, until the glittering mi&s;chief was reclaimed by its proper owner. It was a&s;ked, How could that be character|ized <HI>evil,</HI> which, it was acknowledged, could not be more eligibly di&s;po&s;ed? Per&s;ons, it was &s;aid, <HI>appar|ently</HI> mi&s;erable, are not, in <HI>fact,</HI> &s;o: A&s;k the man who cannot command a &s;hilling, at what price he e&s;timates his <HI>limbs,</HI> his <HI>&s;en&s;es,</HI> his <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> his <HI>pro&s;pect of future hap|pine&s;s;</HI> and, if he under&s;tands how to appreciate the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, properly, he will be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s immen&s;e riches. Sickne&s;s, lo&s;s of friends, and even death it|&s;elf&mdash;Are the&s;e to be con&s;idered as <HI>evils?</HI> Certainly, that is not, <HI>&s;trictly &s;peaking, an evil, which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the completion of our felicity</HI>&mdash;it is, at mo&s;t, but a <HI>&s;eeming evil.</HI></P>
<P>"How often," &s;aid an old gentleman, "does a mo|mentary pang produce the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite enjoyment. I remember, when I was a young man, I had a broth|er, whom I, at that time, loved beyond any other hu|man being. My brother made a voyage to the Ea&s;t-Indies; and, after the tedious term of two years had elap&s;ed, the &s;hip, on board of which he embarked, ap|peared in &s;ight. Eager to embrace him, I jumped into a boat, which was ju&s;t pu&s;hing from the quay: We had not proceeded far, when we ob&s;erved the col|ours hoi&s;ted <HI>half ma&s;t high!</HI> and the captain and the mate, &s;tanding in full view upon the deck, we had po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance of <HI>their</HI> &s;afety. I knew it was not cu&s;tomary to di&s;play colours after that &s;ort, except on the death of one of tho&s;e officers, or of the &s;upercargo,
<PB N="312" REF="034162_0978_0FFC61FE5C23F2F0">
which department was filled by my brother. The melancholy conclu&s;ion, therefore, forced it&s;elf upon me&mdash;he was undoubtedly no more&mdash;and the angui&s;h of my &s;pirit is not to be de&s;cribed. It happened, at that moment, that my brother, expecting to find me among the pa&s;&s;engers in the boat, had placed a tele|&s;cope in a direction, which brought even the features of my face under his immediate in&s;pection; and, ob|&s;erving the &s;udden alteration in my countenance, his &s;ympathetic feelings explained the cau&s;e, when, quit|ting in&s;tantly a &s;ituation which &s;o effectually concealed him, he came forward to the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, and, bowing mo&s;t gracefully, laid one hand on his heart, extending the other in a manner inimitably expre&s;&s;ive.&mdash;God knows, his figure &s;eems, at this moment, pre&s;|ent to my view; and I &s;hall never forget the exqui&s;ite tran&s;ports I then experienced: Nor, <HI>&s;ince it was pro|ductive of &s;o much eventual happine&s;s, can I regard, as an evil,</HI> that affection for a common &s;ailor, which induced his comrades to announce his death, in a manner that was an acknowledged departure from the rule, u&s;ually ob&s;erved on the&s;e occa&s;ions."</P>
<P>You, Mr. Gleaner, will, I apprehend, pronounce this, &s;trange <HI>&s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;oning.</HI> We certainly ought to be very cautious, how we embrace &s;uch &s;ubtilties: But I will not fore&s;tall judgment. An appeal to you was generally approved, and concluded on. The mat|ter is before you; and we expect your an&s;wer with impatience.</P>

<P>BUT, gentle reader, in the moment when throw|ing a&s;ide the veil, I appear before thee in <HI>propria per&s;ona,</HI> acknowledging my&s;elf to be that identical <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> whom po&s;&s;ibly thou maye&s;t recollect, as fill|ing &s;ome pages in the Bo&s;ton, and afterwards in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Magazine&mdash;In the moment, I &s;ay, when thou art recognizing, <HI>in thy friend the Gleaner, this &s;aid Con&s;tantia,</HI> it may be proper to render unto thee a rea&s;on, why I have endeavoured to pa&s;s my&s;elf upon thee in the ma&s;culine character; and as I now take leave of every <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> di&s;gui&s;e, it is my determina|tion to be very explicit.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving, in a variety of in&s;tances, the indifference, not to &s;ay contempt, with which female productions are regarded, and &s;eeking to arre&s;t attention, at lea&s;t for a time, I was thus furni&s;hed with a very powerful motive for an a&s;&s;umption, which I flattered my&s;elf would prove favourable to my a&s;piring wi&s;hes. I an|ticipate, on this occa&s;ion, the <HI>&s;ignificant &s;hrug</HI> and ex|pre&s;&s;ive &s;mile of the <HI>pedantic petit-maitres;</HI> E&s;op's fa|ble of the <HI>A&s;s in the Lion's &s;kin,</HI> will be triumphantly revived; and it will be affirmed, that the <HI>effeminacy</HI> and <HI>tin&s;el glitter</HI> of my &s;tyle could not fail of <HI>betraying</HI> me at every &s;entence which I uttered. But, having pa&s;&s;ed the rubicon, it is nece&s;&s;ary that I po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uffi|cient firmne&s;s to remain undi&s;mayed by the attacks of
<PB N="314" REF="034162_0980_0FFC61FA271F4240">
the ill di&s;po&s;ed critic. My ingenuity did not furni&s;h me with any expedient, &s;o well calculated for conceal|ment, as the envelopment in which I enwrapped my|&s;elf; and having conceived, that in my borrowed character I &s;hould become abundantly more u&s;eful, I felt a&s;&s;ured that this con&s;ideration was in reality &s;uf|ficient to ju&s;tify the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Another &s;trong inducement to the a&s;&s;umption and continuance of my di&s;gui&s;e, was the opportunity it af|forded me of making my&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of the unbia&s;&s;ed &s;entiments of my a&s;&s;ociates. A few per&s;ons were im|mea&s;ureably partial to my e&s;&s;ays; and, as it generally happens, tho&s;e were the individuals with whom alone I was <HI>intimately</HI> conver&s;ant. I had the good fortune to elude the penetration of my be&s;t friend, and he read in my pre&s;ence my fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay, entitled the Glean|er, without the &s;hadow of a &s;u&s;picion of its author. Thus I went on; nor was it until my thirty-third num|ber, which contains the &s;tory of Eliza, that the per&s;on, to whom I am principally accountable for my con|duct, declared his conviction that I was the real author of the Gleaner. <HI>The fact,</HI> from which the little narra|tive of Eliza originated, I received from my hu&s;band; I might have predicted the con&s;equence&mdash;I was of cour&s;e detected.</P>
<P>But I had yet a further rea&s;on for concealment; I was ambitious of being con&s;idered <HI>independent as a writer;</HI> if I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any merit, I was &s;olicitous it &s;hould remain undimini&s;hed, nor did I harbour a wi&s;h that my errors &s;hould be imputed to another; and I imagined I could effectually accompli&s;h my views in this particular, by &s;uffering my connexions of every de&s;cription to remain in total ignorance of my plans; nor in I conceive my&s;elf culpable in thus acting, &s;ince I was not &s;eeking to wound the feelings of any human being, and it was hardly po&s;&s;ible I could <HI>e&s;&s;en|tially</HI> di&s;honour tho&s;e affectionate friends, to whom my heart has ever acknowledged the mo&s;t ardent and grateful attachment.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="034162_0981_0FFC61F8A39D5710">
<HI>Ro&s;&s;eau</HI> has &s;aid, that although a female may <HI>o&s;ten&s;ibly</HI> wield the pen, yet it is certain &s;ome man of letters &s;its behind the curtain to guide its movements; and, con|templating this a&s;&s;ertion, I imagined that if tho&s;e of the <HI>literati,</HI> to who&s;e aid either friend&s;hip or affinity might entitle me, were not &s;o far of my council as even to be informed of my de&s;igns, they would at lea&s;t be exempted from tho&s;e cen&s;ures which my folly or pre|&s;umption might involve.</P>
<P>A celebrated writer of the pre&s;ent century ob&s;erves, that "a <HI>woman</HI> ought never to &s;uffer a <HI>man</HI> to add a <HI>&s;ingle word</HI> to her writings; if &s;he does, the man &s;he con&s;ults, let him be who he may, will always pa&s;s for the original inventor, while &s;he will be accu&s;ed of put|ting her name to the works of others;" and &s;urely the feelings of rectitude mu&s;t revolt even at a &s;u&s;picion of this kind.</P>
<P>Thus much I have thought proper to &s;ay, by way of re&s;ponding to &s;ome invidious remarks, which my <HI>manner</HI> of conducting the foregoing papers, particular|ly their ma&s;culine character, have occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>The reader is already apprized, that the numbers which con&s;titute the fir&s;t volume of the Gleaner were u&s;hered into the world in that very re&s;pectable mi&s;cel|lany, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Magazine; and my original de&s;ign was to continue them in that publication. My &s;ecret was now generally known, but I had no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with the reception given to my hum|ble attempts, and I had many pages prepared for the pre&s;s. It has frequently been a&s;ked, both in public and private, "why the Gleaner was di&s;continued?" The very re&s;pectable and learned gentleman, who&s;e love of literature induced him, on the re&s;u&s;citation of the Magazine, in the &s;pring of 1795, to become its editor, complained, and with rea&s;on, of the paucity of original productions, which immediately &s;ucceeded the arduous engagement into which he had entered: yet, for my&s;elf, largely indebted to the candour of the new editor, I am free to own, that if any con&s;ideration
<PB N="316" REF="034162_0982_0FFC61F5D31F1888">
could have induced me to continue a writer in that publication, my perfect confidence in the &s;uperintend|ent to who&s;e revi&s;ion my &s;ketches would have been &s;ubmitted, mu&s;t have furni&s;hed the motive. But dur|ing the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the mi&s;cellany &s;o often adverted to, a <HI>&s;erious accu&s;ation was preferred again&s;t me,</HI> the na|ture of which, in my own apprehen&s;ion, effectually barred my appearance in its pages.</P>
<P>I have pledged my&s;elf to a public, which I do mo&s;t &s;incerely venerate, to render a rea&s;on, "<HI>why</HI> the Glean|er was not continued in the Magazine;" and although I might content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that its irreg|ularity, and the uncertainty of its duration, together with the years which mu&s;t have elap&s;ed, ere the com|pletion of my plan could have been exhibited, were ex|tremely adver&s;e to my views; yet, agreeably to my en|gagement, I had arranged a circum&s;tantial detail, which developed the <HI>real cau&s;e</HI> that hath produced me, in my <HI>individual character,</HI> a candidate for the indulgence of my readers; <HI>my de&s;ign,</HI> however, is &s;uper&s;eded; a few &s;incere friends, who&s;e di&s;intere&s;ted attachment cannot be con&s;idered as problematical, and from who&s;e judg|ment rea&s;on he&s;itated to appeal, warmly remon&s;trating again&s;t it, rendered it incumbent upon me to deliber|ate&mdash;deliberation produced conviction&mdash;and, certain that a recurrence to facts, which were productive of much infelicity, can an&s;wer no valuable purpo&s;e, I gladly con&s;ign the promi&s;ed narrative to oblivion; and if a recollection of my propo&s;als for this publica|tion &s;hould procure an impeachment of my veracity, I tru&s;t, when it is known, that my original intention has been relinqui&s;hed from the fear of agita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">g the feelings of malevolence, the pleadings of candour will procure my ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>If the manner in which my dramatic e&s;&s;ays are introduced, &s;hould require an apology, it may be &s;uf|ficient to ob&s;erve that it was requi&s;ite to the uniformity of my plan; and I have pre&s;umed that as it was my wi&s;h to promote, by tho&s;e productions, the intere&s;ts of
<PB N="317" REF="034162_0983_0FFC61F390392ED8">
rectitude, they will not, in this <HI>enlightened age,</HI> give offence even to the mo&s;t <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>delicate</HI> mind; their hi&s;tory may, in &s;ome future period, amu&s;e the curious; and for the pre&s;ent, it only remains to &s;ay, that, as I con&s;tructed them without a coadjutor, it is but ju&s;tice their errors, of every de&s;cription, &s;hould re&s;t entirely upon my own head.</P>
<P>Nor are the numerous faults with which the&s;e volumes may abound, to be imputed to any other individual. In this arduous enterpri&s;e, however daring, I have &s;tood alone. To the toil of writing letters to my&s;elf, I have been condemned; and to this cau&s;e the candid will impute that want of variety of which they have doubtle&s;s complained. The aberra|tion of una&s;&s;i&s;ted fancy, however unwearied the intel|lectual re&s;earch, does not always an&s;wer the wi&s;hes of its proprietor; and, although the infrequency of origi|nal views may be lamented, it mu&s;t, neverthele&s;s, be &s;ubmitted to.</P>
<P>My &s;ketches have <HI>&s;eldom</HI> been drawn from <HI>living characters;</HI> but I will confe&s;s I have experienced &s;upe|rior plea&s;ure in once more embodying tho&s;e virtues that I have &s;een exemplified by per&s;ons who have bid adieu to tho&s;e &s;cenes which they have heretofore illumined by their pre&s;ence; and imagination has delighted to produce them again in that radiant career in which it was their great bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;oothe and to ble&s;s the FAMILY OF MAN.</P>
<P>To my very re&s;pectable and numerous Patrons and Patrone&s;&s;es, I am largely indebted. It would be my pride to enhance their plea&s;ures. Could I, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> return for the liberal countenance by which they have hon|oured me, be&s;tow on them tranquillity, with every attendant ble&s;&s;ing, it would be equally my duty and my felicity thus to do: But, although my efforts are inadequate to any important effect, I cannot, how|ever, &s;uppre&s;s the fervid emotions of gratitude with which my brea&s;t is replete. The mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes for their happine&s;s are wafted warm from

my heart. May the good they communicate be re|turned a thou&s;and fold into their own bo&s;oms&mdash;and may they, when encompa&s;&s;ed about by tho&s;e misfor|tunes to which humanity is incident, reflect <HI>rationally</HI> on the <HI>brevity</HI> of the pre&s;ent &s;cene, and upon the incal|culable bli&s;s which awaits them in the regions of im|mortality.</P>
<P>Such are, and &s;uch will continue to be the fervent a&s;pirations of</P>
