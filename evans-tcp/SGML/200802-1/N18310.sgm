<P>BEING embarked with you in the &s;ame common cau&s;e of at|tempting to &s;ave the lives of his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubjects, I have taken the li|berty of prefixing your name to the&s;e Sermons; not with the view of its protecting them, for it &s;eems it was not &s;ufficient to protect your own work, but from a de&s;ire I had of

&s;howing my high e&s;teem of your head and heart. Although we dif|fer in &s;ome points (which are chief|ly &s;peculative) yet I am happy in finding that we agree in tho&s;e things which are mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, in one &s;en&s;e of the words, to man's &s;alvation. It is with plea&s;ure we now &s;ee the &s;ame freedom of enquiry extending it&s;elf to medicine, which has long prevail|ed in religion. While the common people reject infallibility in the head of a church, and a &s;overeign efficacy in a few rites and ceremonies, they have unhappily remained en&s;laved to the infallibility of medicine, or a few trifling pre&s;criptions, which are as unequal to the expectations of the vulgar in curing di&s;ea&s;es, as a wafer or extreme-unction are to expiate their &s;ins. Phy&s;ic will ne|ver &s;uffer by undeceiving the com|mon people; but, on the contrary, like the reformed Religion, it will become illu&s;trious by &s;tripping it of

its pageantry.&mdash;Thus, the Indian receives not half the plea&s;ure from wor&s;hipping the &s;un, which the phi|lo&s;opher does from viewing it thro' a tele&s;cope.</P>
<P>The clergy are not le&s;s honoured now than they were formerly, al|though they do not pretend to work miracles, or to grant ab&s;olution:&mdash; &s;o phy&s;icians would not be le&s;s re|&s;pected, &s;hould they &s;ometimes di&s;|claim their u&s;urped omni&s;cience of the cau&s;es or events of di&s;ea&s;es, nor attempt always to cure them by receipts compo&s;ed of ingredients drawn from every kingdom in na|ture, and every quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>The clergy are often told, that example goes farther than precept. Upon this account, I think it would add much to the dignity of phy&s;ic, if the profe&s;&s;ors of it would live a|greeable to their doctrines.</P>

<P>When thou fitte&s;t to eat with a ruler, con|&s;ider diligently what is before thee. And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. Be not de&s;irous of his dainties, for they are deceitful meat.</P></Q>

<P>THESE are the words of King Solo|mon, emphatically called the Wi&s;e Man, from his great pre-eminence in wi&s;dom over the whole human race. His knowledge, like his plea&s;ures, was unconfined, and while he tortured na|ture for the one, he ran&s;acked her no le&s;s for the other. He was none of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who exclaim again&s;t the
<PB N="8" REF="023758_0008_0FC0F01C17E83570">
world for no other rea&s;on, than becau&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of it. He ta&s;ted, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he knew every thing which the mind of man in its mo&s;t im|proved &s;tate is capable of ta&s;ting, po&s;&s;e&s;s|ing, or knowing. This rai&s;es his cha|racter above all prai&s;e, and gives the &s;ame eloquence to every thing which comes from his pen, as if a voice had proclaimed it from heaven.</P>
<P>Without taking up your time in wire-drawing the words, which are plain, and &s;tand in need of no illu&s;tration, I &s;hall proceed immediately to &s;peak of TEM|PERANCE in EATING. The method I have cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e, is to con|&s;ider it as it relates</P>
<P N="1">I. To the QUALITY.</P>
<P N="2">II. To the QUANTITY of our ALI|MENT. And,</P>
<P N="3">III. To the TIME of taking it. Af|ter this I &s;hall conclude with an APPLI|CATION.</P>
<P N="1">I. OF THE QUALITY OF OUR ALI|MENT. There hath been much com|mon-place
<PB N="9" REF="023758_0009_0FC0F01D8F4A0060">
declamation upon this &s;ub|ject. There is &s;uch a variety in the appetites and con&s;titutions of mankind (implanted originally for wi&s;e purpo&s;es) that no fixed rules can be laid down un|der this head. In general, the more &s;imple our food is, the better. Animal and vegetable food &s;hould always be mixed together by people in health.&mdash; That nature intended man &s;hould be &s;upported by them both, we infer from the &s;tructure of his teeth, and organs of dige&s;tion, which are formed upon the compound principles of carnivorous and granivorous animals. The proportion of vegetable food &s;hould always predo|minate, e&s;pecially in warm &s;ea&s;ons, and warm climates. Wild animals, and tho&s;e which are full grown, &s;hould be prefer|red to tame and young animals, as be|ing more ea&s;y of dige&s;tion and per&s;pira|tion. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, fle&s;h which has been kept for &s;ome time, is to be preferred to that which is newly killed.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid again&s;t high-&s;ea|&s;oned food. To per&s;ons, in the full vi|gor of health and youth, I grant it may be hurtful; but to old, and to &s;ickly peo|ple,
<PB N="10" REF="023758_0010_0FC0F02728FB0EF0">
who are afflicted with a general tor|por of the alimentary canal, it is not only inoffen&s;ive, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry. I appeal to all &s;uch of my hearers, as labour under a weakne&s;s of the &s;to|mach, indige&s;tion, acid belchings, and the like, whether a little &s;alted or &s;moak|ed beef has not &s;at ea&s;ier upon your &s;to|machs, and been &s;ooner dige&s;ted, than the mo&s;t &s;imple food that could be con|trived. High-&s;ea&s;oned food is like|wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to the inhabitants of low mar&s;hy countries, more e&s;pecially at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of the year, when the di&s;|ea&s;es of &s;uch places are epidemic. It is remarked in &s;ome of the We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands, as well as in tho&s;e parts of South-America, which are within the tropic, that &s;uch as eat a large quantity of &s;pices of all kinds, with their food, are le&s;s &s;ub|ject to the intermitting and bilious fe|vers, than tho&s;e who avoid them. This is ea&s;ily accounted for, when we reflect, how much they obviate the relaxing powers of heat and moi&s;ture, which al|ways combine to produce the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. It is for this rea&s;on, probably, that Pro|vidence has &s;o ordered it, that the &s;picy trees grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly in warm cli|mates only, in all parts of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="023758_0011_0FC0F02853415A10">Before I conclude this head, I &s;hall remark, that little mi&s;chief is done to the con&s;titution by the quality of ali|ment. Nature, for the mo&s;t part, takes the alarm, and, unle&s;s we u&s;e violence with her, deprives us of our reli&s;h for tho&s;e things, which are de&s;tructive to our con&s;titutions. Such per&s;ons as love meat with tho&s;e qualities which are hurt|ful, too often love likewi&s;e an exce&s;s in quantity, which leads us to the next head we propo&s;ed, namely, to &s;peak</P>
<P N="2">II. OF THE QUANTITY OF OUR A|LIMENT. 'Temperance (&s;ays Sir Wil|liam Temple) con&s;i&s;ts in a regular and &s;imple diet, limited by every man's ex|perience of his own ea&s;y dige&s;tion."&mdash; Food, therefore, may be &s;aid to be ta|ken in too large a quantity, when we do not feel light and cheerful after it.&mdash; There are few who do not eat one third, or a fourth, more than is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport them. The chief incentive to this is the variety of our di&s;hes, which excites us to eat after the appetite is &s;a|tisfied. Few men, I believe, ever eat to exce&s;s more than <HI>once</HI> of one plain di&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023758_0012_0FC0F02BD6B28C00">The church of Rome acts with a wi&s;e regard to the health as well as morals of her &s;ons, in pre&s;cribing ab&s;tinence from fle&s;h during Lent, and in allowing them nothing but fi&s;h &mdash;Mo&s;t animals, in the &s;pring of the year, or the &s;ea&s;on of Lent, are very poor, and upon &s;everal ac|counts unfit for food; but the chief rea|&s;on upon which this canon is founded, and which &s;erves our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e more immediately, is, that, by confi|ning them to fi&s;h only, there is le&s;s dan|ger of their eating to exce&s;s. Nature, we &s;ee, not only in this, but in another &s;en&s;ual enjoyment,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let thy fountain be ble&s;&s;ed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Let her be as the loving hind and plea&s;ant roe; let her brea&s;ts &s;atisfy thee at <HI>all times,</HI> and be thou ravi&s;hed <HI>always</HI> with her love. And why wilt thou, my &s;on, be ravi&s;hed with a &s;trange woman, and embrace the bo&s;om of a &s;tranger? <HI>Prov.</HI> v. 18, 19, 20.</NOTE> &s;eems to have &s;et a guard over our health, and, in&s;tead of rou&s;ing our &s;en&s;ations by variety or no|velty, kindly keeps them &s;u&s;pended, till appetite and plea&s;ure are awakened to|gether, which to the &s;ame object they never will be oftener than is con&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="13" REF="023758_0013_0FC0F03255FCEBE8">
with the health and vigor of the con&s;ti|tution. This wi&s;e oeconomy in the make of our bodies cannot be too much ad|mired, e&s;pecially as we are enabled to di&s;cover in it the &s;trict connexion be|tween the po&s;itive precepts of heaven, and our own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Next to our eating of but one di&s;h, I would inculcate eating but one <HI>hearty</HI> meal a day. In &s;upport of this piece of advice, I might here &s;ummons many of the illu&s;trious dead among the ancient philo&s;ophers and legi&s;lators, who never eat more than one hearty meal in the four-and-twenty hours. So common was this &s;implicity of living in Greece, that Plato, upon being a&s;ked, when he returned to Athens from his travels into Sicily, what he had &s;een that was curi|ous while he was abroad, an&s;wered, <HI>Vidi mon&s;trum in natura, hominem bis &s;atura|tum in die</HI>&mdash;"I have beheld (&s;aid he) a mon&s;ter in nature; a man who eat two hearty meals in a day." The&s;e are more than &s;ufficient to repair the daily wa&s;te of the body. They oppre&s;s nature, and keep her con&s;tantly fatigued, in concoct|ing the immen&s;e &s;upplies of food which
<PB N="14" REF="023758_0014_0FC0F03387E360F0">
are thrown into the &s;tomach. Although &s;he &s;ometimes forbears long, yet, &s;oon|er or later, &s;he takes ample vengeance of &s;uch as treat her in this manner, by afflicting them with blotches, and other di&s;orders, which are the legitimate off|&s;pring of this &s;pecies of intemperance. But if we are to eat only one hearty meal a day, a que&s;tion very naturally occurs here, and that is, at what time &s;hould it be taken?</P>
<P>This brings us to our la&s;t general head, namely, to &s;peak of temperance as it re|lates to the</P>
<P N="3">III. TIME OF EATING. At pre&s;ent noon is looked upon as the mo&s;t proper for this purpo&s;e. Hence we generally find dinner the principal meal through this country. I am aware of the diffi|culty of oppo&s;ing popular prejudices, and that it is often much better to &s;wim with the multitude down the &s;tream than to &s;tem it alone. I am aware too of the fate of reformers in religion, politics, and &s;cience. Many have lo&s;t their characters, their livings, and even their lives, by advancing things contrary to
<PB N="15" REF="023758_0015_0FC0F039E01C6DB0">
the e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions of the world. But, &s;hould this be my ca&s;e, I will not conceal my &s;entiments, nor re&s;i&s;t what I look upon and feel to be the &s;acred power of truth. It is well known to every one, that exerci&s;e of mind or body is di&s;agreeable after dinner. Nature re|coils from them both. Every full meal is a &s;timulous to the whole &s;y&s;tem, and brings on a temporary fever, which &s;hows it&s;elf in that chilline&s;s and quick|ne&s;s of pul&s;e, which are &s;o remarkable after eating. To add to the&s;e either ex|erci&s;e of body or mind, is to divide and weaken the powers of nature in a work which requires the combined action of them all. Upon this account, I think the principal meal &s;hould always be made in the evening.</P>
<P>The old Romans, we find, in the early and virtuous ages of their common-wealth, made their chief meal after night. The French (except &s;uch of them as co|py after the Engli&s;h manners) and the Italians always make &s;upper their prin|cipal meal. The Indians in this coun|try (who live the mo&s;t agreeable to na|ture of any people in the world) eat fle&s;h
<PB N="16" REF="023758_0016_0FC0F03B5245EAE0">
but once in the four-and-twenty hours, and that is in the evening, after the fa|tigues of fi&s;hing, hunting, or marching, are over. The Spaniards, who have not yet adopted the French and Italian cu&s;|tom of making their chief meal at night, are neverthele&s;s &s;o unanimous in the practice of &s;leeping an hour or two every day after dinner, that it is a common thing to hear a Spaniard &s;ay, in mo&s;t of the cities of Spain, that 'none but Eng|li&s;hmen and dogs are to be &s;een in their &s;treets immediately after dinner.' Sleep is always natural after eating. Nature calls loudly for it. It is common to all the brute animals we are acquainted with. That &s;tate of the body or mind which approaches neare&s;t to it, is always mo&s;t agreeable to us, when we cannot enjoy it immediately.&mdash;Hence we read that many ancient nations u&s;ed to re|cline upon beds or cu&s;hions, and to lean upon each other at their entertainments. This po&s;ture in eating was practi&s;ed by the Greeks, Romans,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bed u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e by the Romans was called from the Greeks TRICLINIUM, from its containing only three people. Juvenal, &s;peak|ing of this po&s;ture in eating, &s;ays,
<Q>"<HI>Gremio</HI> jacet nova nupra mariti."</Q>
Hence &s;o &s;ome derive the origin of the expre&s;&s;ion, "Bo&s;om friends."</NOTE> and Per&s;ians,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">E&s;ther and Haman lay upon the &s;ame bed at the royal banquet given by the queen to king A|ha&s;uenus. E&s;ther vii. 8.</NOTE>
<PB N="17" REF="023758_0017_0FC0F03F594F2810">
nor was it uncommon among the Jews.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">We infer that this practice was common a|mong the Jews from the cu&s;tom of pulling off their &s;hoes before they began to eat; the de&s;ign of this being to pre&s;erve their beds clean. Our Saviour, we find, conformed to it. Unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e this, we cannot explain in what manner Mary Magda|len <HI>&s;tood behind</HI> him while he was eating in the hou&s;e of Simon, and "wa&s;hed his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.' Luke vii. 38. At the la&s;t fea&s;t he had with his di&s;ciples (which was a &s;upper) he admitted him who &s;at next to him to lean upon his bo&s;om. John xiii. 25.</NOTE> But what proves, above all things, that re&s;t and &s;leep are nece&s;&s;ary after eating, is, that dige&s;tion has been lately proved to be carried on chiefly by FERMENTA|TION, to which re&s;t, every body knows, is &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, that it cannot take place without it. Unle&s;s the body
<PB N="18" REF="023758_0018_0FC0F040D17B3C28">
enjoys more or le&s;s of this after eating, there can be no <HI>perfect</HI> concoction of the food. This is what all mu&s;t con&s;ent to, who have been obliged to ride on hor&s;e|back, or to u&s;e any violent exerci&s;e of body, after a hearty dinner. The di|ge&s;tion, in &s;uch ca&s;es, is &s;o di&s;turbed, that per&s;ons have complained of being indi&s;po&s;ed for &s;everal days after it.</P>
<P>But methinks I hear &s;ome object and &s;ay, that eating a hearty &s;upper makes them re&s;tle&s;s in the night, and prevents their &s;leeping. To &s;uch I would wi&s;h joy.&mdash;It is a proof that nature has not yet &s;unk under the weight of two hearty meals a day; for I never heard any one make this complaint who did not like|wi&s;e eat a hearty dinner. Leave off di|ning in your u&s;ual manner, and, in&s;tead of eating half a pound, or a pound of fle&s;h, with vegetables proportioned to it, allay your appetite with a little bread and chee&s;e, a bowl of light &s;oup, a cup of coffee or chocolate, or, after the French cu&s;tom, with a few rai&s;ins, or an apple, and I am per&s;uaded you will feel no inconvenience from eating a mode|rate &s;upper. Here give me leave to re|mark
<PB N="19" REF="023758_0019_0FC0F0424F7824E0">
to you, that the more of the&s;e light &s;ub&s;tances you take during the day, the better, as they tend to le&s;&s;on the &s;en&s;e of hunger, or the keenne&s;s of the appe|tite, which too often provokes us to in|temperance Sir Francis Bacon tells us a &s;tory of a very old man, who&s;e manner of living he enquired into, and found that he ob&s;erved no other rules than eating <HI>before</HI> he was hungry, and drinking <HI>before</HI> he was dry; for by the&s;e means, he &s;aid, he was &s;ure never to eat nor to drink too much at a time.&mdash;If we appeal once more to the brute ani+mals, they will furni&s;h us with arguments in favour of this practice. Every ana|logy borrowed from them de&s;erves to be attended to, as they have never yet &s;ub|jected their in&s;tincts to the tyranny of fa&s;hion. The cow and the hor&s;e, as al|&s;o the &s;heep, when they range at large in a pa&s;ture, feed with little interruption during the day, and thus guard again&s;t the intemperate effects of hunger. The hor&s;e, it is true, &s;ometimes &s;uffers from this cau&s;e; but it is only when he is obliged to live as we do, that is, to di|vide his meals into three or four in a day, and to work immediately after|wards
<PB N="20" REF="023758_0020_0FC0F048E66062F8">
It is univer&s;ally agreed, that people live much longer in warm than in cold climates. May not one rea&s;on of this be owing to the heat of &s;uch cli|mates dimini&s;hing their appetites, and thus preventing their wearing out their con&s;titutions by exce&s;s of eating?&mdash;I would have it remembered here, that in &s;peaking of warm climates, I mean the improved parts of A&s;ia and Africa only. The warm climates of America are as yet too little cultivated, to allow us to extend the ob&s;ervation to our own country.&mdash;But to return. Me|thinks I hear others &s;ay, if we make &s;upper our principal meal, we &s;hall o|ver&s;et part of an old rule, which bids us,
<Q><L>After dinner &s;it a while,</L>
<L>After &s;upper walk a mile.</L></Q>
This adage, it is true, from its great antiquity, as well as from its being de|livered in rhyme, comes armed with the &s;trength of Samp&s;on, but it does not require the &s;kill of a Delilah to cut its locks. I might here mention an hundred common &s;ayings in &s;everal of the arts and &s;ciences, as well as in com|mon

life, which are equally univer&s;al, and at the &s;ame time equally fal&s;e with the above. It is a vulgar error, and is repugnant both to experience and &s;ound philo&s;ophy. I conclude, therefore, that it is mo&s;t agreeable to the u&s;age of the mo&s;t civilized nations&mdash;to the practice of &s;avages&mdash;to nature&mdash;and to common experience, to eat our chief meal at night, and that the &s;eeming objections again&s;t it are of no weight.</P>

<P>THE la&s;t time I addre&s;&s;ed you from this place, I enlarged upon Tem|perance in Eating; in the pre&s;ent di&s;|cour&s;e, I &s;hall lay before you a few con|&s;iderations upon the USE and ABUSE of WINE and STRONG DRINK. This, I &s;hall attempt, by con&s;idering more par|ticularly
<PB N="26" REF="023758_0026_0FC0F058D048DE78">
the words of our text. For this purpo&s;e, I &s;hall enquire,</P>
<P N="1">I. TO WHOM WINE AND STRONG DRINK SHOULD BE GIVEN.</P>
<P N="2">II. TO WHOM THEY SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN; and then I &s;hall conclude with an APPLICATION.</P>
<P N="1">I. WINE OR STRONG DRINK MAY BE GIVEN.</P>
<P N="1">1. To the &s;ick. The di&s;ea&s;es in which wine is indicated are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The <HI>&s;low nervous fever.</HI> Here the powers of nature are weakened and oppre&s;&s;ed, and the poor patient may, &s;trictly &s;peaking, be &s;aid to be ready to peri&s;h. Wine may be admini&s;tered therefore in &s;uch ca&s;es with advantage.&mdash;If ever it fails of doing &s;ervice, it is becau&s;e it is given in too &s;mall a quantity. <HI>Secondly,</HI> In chronic di&s;ea&s;es, which are accompanied with a langour of the whole &s;y&s;tem, which &s;hows it&s;elf in a more e&s;pecial manner in the <HI>&s;tomach,</HI> wine is a &s;ove|reign remedy. It was to relieve a com|plaint of this kind that St. Paul pre&s;cri|bed it to his &s;on Timothy. By its gen|tle
<PB N="27" REF="023758_0027_0FC0F05A4FA2B750">
&s;timulus it excites the action of the &s;tomach&mdash;invigorates the circulation&mdash; opens ob&s;tructions&mdash;and thus, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, renews the whole con&s;titution. The relief which wine affords in the&s;e ca&s;es, is the more certain, if the weak|ne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem has been brought on by grief, or any of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which are of the &s;edative kind. Here the hea|vy heart is revived, and made to &s;ing for joy.</P>
<P N="2">2. Wine is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to the inhabitants of low mar&s;hy countries. The moi&s;ture of &s;uch places ob&s;tructs per&s;piration, and brings on a general laxity of the &s;y&s;tem. When u&s;ed in a moderate quantity, it braces the &s;olids, and by keeping up a proper balance between them and the fluids, it obviates di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;Hence we &s;eldom find tho&s;e people, who live in affluence, and who can afford to drink a gla&s;s or two of generous wine every day, afflicted with tho&s;e fevers and agues, which make &s;uch great havock among poor people. The Hollanders have been charged with the national reflection of loving &s;trong drink. This cen&s;ure is unju&s;t, as nece&s;&s;ity at
<PB N="28" REF="023758_0028_0FC0F063F0AFB308">
fir&s;t drove them to it; and as it is by u&s;ing wine and other &s;pirituous liquors in moderation, that they guard them|&s;elves from the ill effects of the moi&s;ture to which their country is always expo&s;ed. Remember, you are to u&s;e wine in the&s;e ca&s;es only during that &s;ea&s;on, in which the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are epidemic; which, in this climate, is chiefly during the months of Augu&s;t, September, and Oc|tober. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. Wine is principally u&s;eful to old people, or &s;uch as are in the decline of life. It is hard to fix the limits between the beginning of old age, and the clo&s;e of manhood. At a medium, the body begins to decline at the age of forty-five or fifty in this climate. Then the hot fit of the fever of life begins to abate, and from the many di&s;appointments in love&mdash;friend&s;hip&mdash;ambition, or trade, which mo&s;t of men meet with by the time they arrive at this age, they gene|rally feel a heavy heart.&mdash;The decay of the vital heat&mdash;the &s;lowne&s;s of the pul&s;e &mdash;the diminution of the &s;trength, all &s;how that the vigour of the &s;y&s;tem is declining. Here wine prolongs the
<PB N="29" REF="023758_0029_0FC0F064F73725A8">
&s;trength and powers of nature; it is the grave of pa&s;t misfortunes: in a word, it is another name for phylo&s;ophy. Re|member, my aged hearers, if you would expect to enjoy a long reprieve from the infirmities of age, you mu&s;t begin to u&s;e wine moderately, and increa&s;e the quantity of it as you de&s;cend into the valley of life.&mdash;Add to this, you mu&s;t dimini&s;h the quantity of your &s;olid aliment.&mdash;This nature points out to us; by depriving us of our teeth in propor|tion as we grow old, teaching us there|by, that we have now no longer u&s;e for them.</P>
<P>I come now to the &s;econd general head of my di&s;cour&s;e, namely,</P>
<P N="2">II. TO SHOW TO WHOM WINE OR STRONG DRINK SHOULD NOT BE GIV|EN.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> place, it &s;hould not be given to children. Wine, we &s;aid for|merly, is of a heating nature, and is in|dicated in tho&s;e con&s;titutions and ages, where a &s;timulus is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the powers of life. Children, from the natural vigour of their &s;y&s;tems, which &s;hows it&s;elf in the remarkable quickne&s;s
<PB N="30" REF="023758_0030_0FC0F06655445218">
of their pul&s;es, and in their great acti|vity of mind and body, &s;tand in no need of a &s;timulus of this kind. On the con|trary, every thing &s;hould be withheld from them, which tends to add to the natural impetuo&s;ity of their fluids, or the vigorous action of their &s;olids.&mdash; Hence we are led to commend tho&s;e parents, who forbid their children to ta&s;te all kinds of animal food (upon the account of its &s;timulating quality) till they are upwards of &s;even or eight years of age. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Studious people, or tho&s;e who have occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e their thinking faculties much, &s;hould ab&s;tain from wine. Thinking is a &s;timulus to the con&s;titution, and wears out the &s;prings of life beyond the mo&s;t laborious exer|ci&s;e of body.&mdash;Much &s;tudy is literally a "wearine&s;s of the fle&s;h."&mdash;Hence we find &s;tate&s;men, generals, and even &s;uch as fill the learned profe&s;&s;ions with dig|nity, are more &s;ubject to the gout, from &s;mall deviations in their ordinary way of living, than other people. Wine, and a con&s;tant or vigorous exertion of the active faculties of the &s;oul, produce
<PB N="31" REF="023758_0031_0FC0F067D16AD8D8">
nearly the &s;ame effects upon the body. &mdash;This is one rea&s;on probably why So|lomon, in the chapter from whence our text is taken, &s;ays, "It is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes &s;trong drink." Much recreation and great exerci&s;e of body, are nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t the effects of too much applica|tion of the mind to bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;hould the &s;timulating effects of wine be added to this, relief will be &s;ought from exerci&s;e and amu&s;ements in vain. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. Wine &s;hould not be u&s;ed by young people, or &s;uch as are under five and thirty or forty years of age, unle&s;s they labour under &s;ome of tho&s;e evils we mentioned under our fir&s;t head. The pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures of youth are too often more than &s;ufficient to keep the &s;y&s;tem in an excited &s;tate. To add wine to the&s;e, is like throwing oil into fire, in order to extingui&s;h it. It is al|ways a &s;ign of a vitiated heart, when in full health wine is called for, in order to impart cheerfulne&s;s to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>O &s;eldom may the fatal hour return,</L><L>Of drinking deep!

wine in the early part of life; you will receive benefit from it when you grow old. You will likewi&s;e e&s;|cape that dreadful &s;courge of intempe|rance the gout. This is the natural off|&s;pring of wine. In the great empire of China the gout is unknown. This is owing to their being unacquainted with the juice of the grape; and is a proof that the other cau&s;es, which have been accu&s;ed of bringing on the gout, act too feebly to produce it, unle&s;s they are rou&s;ed into action by the u&s;e of wine. Be&s;ides all this, by refraining from wine during this period of your lives, you may become the fathers of a healthful pro|geny, who&s;e ruddy looks, and well-form|ed limbs, will adorn your happy board, and more than repay you for your ab|&s;tinence and &s;elf-denial.</P>

<P>But methinks I hear &s;ome of you &s;ay &mdash;why all this noi&s;e about wine and &s;trong drink?&mdash;Have we not &s;een hun|dreds,

who have made it a con&s;tant practi&s;e to get drunk almo&s;t every day for thirty or forty years, who, notwith|&s;tanding, arrived to a great age, and enjoyed the &s;ame good health as tho&s;e who have followed the &s;tricte&s;t rules of temperance&mdash;or who have lived by weight and mea&s;ure like Lewis Corna|ro him&s;elf?&mdash;Some in&s;tances of this kind I grant might be mentioned; but they are few when compared with the num|ber of tho&s;e who have ab&s;tained from wine and &s;trong drink: even the&s;e have began to drink after their con&s;titutions were on the decline. They were more|over generally poor people, who were obliged to work hard for their &s;upport, and thus by their labour carried off the effects of their intemperance. But who knows how much longer they might have lived, had they been more tempe|rate. Perhaps after all, they died mar|tyrs to &s;pirituous liquors, and at the age of eighty, ninety, or even an hundred, were guilty of a &s;pecies of &s;uicide. If you &s;hould &s;ee a &s;ailor fall from the ma&s;t of a &s;hip under full &s;ail into the &s;ea, and afterwards be taken up alive, would you not think his companions mad, if
<PB N="34" REF="023758_0034_0FC0F0778B395A20">
they &s;hould leap from the &s;ame place, in hopes of meeting with the &s;ame good fortune?&mdash;</P>
<P>But who is he that &s;ays, if we bani&s;h wine from company, how &s;hall we con|trive to entertain our friends? The poets and philo&s;ophers of former ages, who abound &s;o much with the prai&s;es of wine, would ri&s;e up again&s;t us, &s;hould we tear &s;o precious a relick from the temple of ho&s;pitality. To this I an&s;wer, that more have complained of drinking too much, than of drinking too little in company. How many have refu&s;ed to be pre&s;ent at entertainments, only be|cau&s;e they were afraid of being forced to drink to exce&s;s? How many are obliged to counterfeit excu&s;es, or to &s;teal pri|vately from company for the &s;ame rea|&s;on? What confu&s;ion&mdash;what di&s;cord, among the mo&s;t intimate friends, have you not &s;een follow tho&s;e fea&s;ts where the ho&s;t has relied upon the quantity or goodne&s;s of his wine, for the enter|tainment of his gue&s;ts?&mdash;Three or four gla&s;&s;es of wine will impart all its cheer|ful qualities to a &s;tomach which is not rendered in&s;en&s;ible to it by habit or
<PB N="35" REF="023758_0035_0FC0F079392F9E30">
di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e may be taken occa&s;ion|ally among friends by per&s;ons of all a|ges and conditions, e&s;pecially upon fe&s;|tive &s;ea&s;ons. The&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, however, &s;hould not recur too often. Our SAVI|OUR wrought a miracle at a wedding, in order to furni&s;h wine to the gue&s;ts; but he fed five thou&s;and people with a few loves and fi&s;hes in the wilderne&s;s, without ordering any wine to be drank after them. This is the more remark|able, as there is no food which is &s;up|po&s;ed to require wine with it &s;o much as fi&s;h,&mdash;it being a common &s;aying, that it &s;hould always &s;wim three times&mdash; namely, in water&mdash;butter&mdash;and wine.</P>
<P>It is time now to ha&s;ten to the AP|PLICATION of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Here then I would call upon the di&s;|ea&s;ed and the melancholy part of my hearers, as well as &s;uch who&s;e misfor|tune it is to live in low mar&s;hy coun|tries, to come and partake of this &s;ove|reign antidote to di&s;ea&s;e and care.&mdash; Bani&s;h your cordials&mdash;your bitters, and your magne&s;ias, the paltry pre&s;criptions of mercenary quacks, and &s;ub&s;titute in the room of them a few gla&s;&s;es of good

old wine. But to you, my aged hear|ers&mdash;my venerable fathers, would I chiefly addre&s;s my&s;elf. Come here and drown all your &s;orrows in full bumpers of Li&s;bon or Madeira.&mdash;Here forget the incon&s;tancy of your mi&s;tre&s;&s;es&mdash;the perfidy of friends&mdash;the broken promi&s;es of your patrons&mdash;and the villainy of tho&s;e who have betrayed either your in|tere&s;t or character.&mdash;Above all things, here you may forget not only to com|plain, but even to feel mo&s;t of tho&s;e infirmities which are too often connec|ted with your age. "The keepers of the hou&s;e, &s;hall cea&s;e to tremble&mdash;nor &s;hall the &s;trong men bow them&s;elves; and al|though your grinders may cea&s;e, becau&s;e they are few, yet tho&s;e that look out of the windows, &s;hall not be darkened.&mdash; Ye &s;hall not ri&s;e at the voice of the bird, unable to &s;leep any longer, nor &s;hall the gra&s;s-hopper any more be a burthen to you." The days &s;hall never come in which you &s;hall &s;ay, "we have no plea|&s;ure in them." Thus will you prolong your health and &s;pirits till, like full ma|tured fruit, you &s;hall drop into the lap of your mother earth. Your bodies, like the garments of the children of I&s;|rael,

&s;hall not be torn by the ravages of time&mdash;and the &s;ame &s;troke which puts an end to your enjoyments, &s;hall cut the &s;ilver cord of life.</P>
<P>It is now time to addre&s;s my&s;elf to another cla&s;s of my hearers. Fir&s;t, let me call upon parents to withhold wine from their children. It is a poi&s;on in|&s;tead of a cordial, which you pour down their little throats. No fortune which you can bequeath them, will ever be e|quivalent for depriving them of the in|e&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of a good con&s;titution. Next, let me call upon &s;tate&s;men, legi&s;|lators, and all tho&s;e who labour for the public good, to ab&s;tain from wine. Re|member, you are the guardians of your country: public bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould, like time, have no pau&s;es. How often have treaties been &s;u&s;pended, and even march|es and battles been delayed, by the principals or leaders of them being laid up with a fit of the gout. Suffer not the &s;hort-lived plea&s;ures of drinking, to rob you of your fame or importance, or to ob&s;truct your motions through the&s;e exalted &s;pheres which you are called to fill. But to you, young men, would I
<PB N="38" REF="023758_0038_0FC0F087D50C2B18">
now, in the la&s;t place, addre&s;s my&s;elf.&mdash; You have heard &s;everal arguments a|gain&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of your drinking wine. None of you can pretend to be of heavy hearts, or ready to peri&s;h. If you are not moved by a regard to your own health and happine&s;s&mdash;think of your po&s;terity. Let not your third and forth generations be vi&s;ited for your iniqui|ties: they will imprecate vengeance up|on your a&s;hes every time they feel the puni&s;hment of your folly.</P>
<P>But if, after all I have &s;aid, you are determined to per&s;evere in your u&s;ual manner of living, I mu&s;t addre&s;s you once more in the words of the Wi&s;e Man, and &s;ay, "Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the &s;ight of thine eyes;" yet remember there is a time coming when you will repent that you have hated reproof, and turned a deaf ear to the voice of the preacher. There is the &s;ame in&s;eparable connec|tion between intemperance and di&s;ea&s;e, that there is betwixt vice and its puni&s;h|ment. Unle&s;s you &s;hould be cut off by

&s;ome &s;udden gu&s;t of intemperance, you may depend upon feeling the effects of it hereafter. Think now, I be&s;eech you, of the &s;leeple&s;s nights&mdash;of the low &s;pirits&mdash;of the &s;corching pains in your hands and feet which await you. To give you an idea of the dreadful con&s;e|quences of exce&s;s in drinking, let me beg of you to accompany me to the bed-chamber of a mar afflicted with the gout. Be not alarmed at his groans&mdash; Let us go in&mdash;Is this the man who a few years ago was the life and &s;oul of every company he went into?&mdash;Is this he who boa&s;ted of the quantity of liquor he could drink without being intoxica+ted?&mdash;who &s;pent his youth in a con&s;tant round of gaiety and plea&s;ure?&mdash;How is he changed!&mdash;It is now eleven years &s;ince he has been a pri&s;oner in this cham|ber. His phy&s;icians have long &s;ince de&s;erted him! nor is it any reproach to their art that they cannot cure him, any more than it is that they are unable to rai&s;e the dead. He is a burthen to his friends. In vain does he &s;eek relief from wine&mdash;food&mdash;phy&s;ic&mdash;company, or even from philo&s;ophy. His only a|mu&s;ement is to number the days of his

This is no exaggerated picture. We have all &s;een it at &s;ome time of our lives.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude what has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, with words more to our purpo&s;e than tho&s;e of Solomon: "Who hath woe? who hath &s;orrow? who hath contentions? who hath bab|ling? who hath wounds without cau&s;e? who hath redne&s;s of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to &s;eek mixt wine. Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth it&s;elf aright.

<PB N="42" REF="023758_0042_0FC0F09848671F80">
brow he &s;hould eat bread all the days of his life;" we cannot help admiring the goodne&s;s of the Supreme Being, in connecting his puni&s;hment with what had now become the nece&s;&s;ary means of pre&s;erving his health. Had God aban|doned him to idlene&s;s, he would have entailed tenfold mi&s;ery upon him. The &s;olid parts of his body, particularly the nerves, would have lo&s;t their tone&mdash;the mu&s;cles would have lo&s;t their feeling and moving powers&mdash;and the fluids, in con&s;equence of this, would have lo&s;t their original or native qualities, and have &s;tagnated in every part of his bo|dy. But, in&s;tead of inflicting this com|plicated puni&s;hment upon him, he bids him be ACTIVE, and implants a princi|ple within him which impels him to it. Civil &s;ociety and agriculture began to|gether. The latter has always been looked upon among the fir&s;t employ|ments of mankind.&mdash;It calls forth every individual of the human race into acti|on;&mdash;it employs the body in a manner the mo&s;t conducive to its health; it pre&s;erves and increa&s;es the &s;pecies mo&s;t; &mdash;and la&s;tly, it is mo&s;t friendly to the practice of virtue. For the&s;e rea&s;ons,
<PB N="43" REF="023758_0043_0FC0F09958663F10">
therefore, it is natural to conclude, that it is mo&s;t agreeable to the Supreme Be|ing, that man &s;hould be &s;upported by it. The earth is a &s;kilful as well as a kind mother to her children. In&s;tead of pouring her trea&s;ures in lapfuls upon them at once, and con&s;igning them to idlene&s;s ever afterwards, &s;he be&s;tows her gifts with a &s;paring hand, and cea&s;es to yield them any thing, as &s;oon as they cea&s;e to cultivate her. Thus by en|tailing con&s;tant labour, &s;he meant to entail con&s;tant health upon them.</P>
<P>But the&s;e employments were too in|nocent for the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of man. He &s;oon de&s;erted his fields&mdash;and his flocks&mdash;and &s;ought for &s;ome more &s;pee|dy methods of acquiring fortune&mdash;inde|pendence&mdash;and a &s;uperiority over his fellow-creatures. The&s;e have been ob|tained by commerce&mdash;war&mdash;rapine&mdash; and la&s;tly, to the reproach of the Ame|rican colonies, and of humanity, be it &s;poken, by the perpetration of a crime, compared with which, every other breach of the laws of nature or nations, de&s;erves the name of holine&s;s, I mean, by SLAVERY. But in exchange for
<PB N="44" REF="023758_0044_0FC0F09DA3D6E570">
the&s;e, he hath given up that greate&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings, HEALTH. He hath had recour&s;e to medicine as a &s;uccedaneum for labour; but this hath proved inef|fectual; for the fo&s;&s;il&mdash;vegetable&mdash;and tho&s;e parts of the animal kingdom which are employed in medicine, have not yet learned, like man, to ri&s;e in rebellion again&s;t the will of their Creator. So|lomon &s;eems to have been aware of this in the words of our text; and hence we hear him calling upon him to awake from his unhealthy "&s;lumber"&mdash;to ri&s;e from his enervating bed&mdash;to unfold his "arms," and employ them in &s;ome u&s;e|ful labour, lea&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, with its com|panion "poverty," &s;hould come upon him like "travail upon a woman with child; or like an "armed man:" nei|ther of which can be avoided or re&s;i&s;ted. But Solomon, and all the preachers from his time to the pre&s;ent day, who have addre&s;&s;ed him upon this &s;ubject, have u&s;ed their eloquence in vain. Since therefore we cannot bring man back again to his implements of hu&s;bandry, we mu&s;t attempt to find out &s;ome kinds of exerci&s;e as &s;ub&s;titutes for them. The mo&s;t healthy and long-lived people are

found among the labouring part of man|kind &mdash;Would the rich then enjoy health and long-life, they mu&s;t do that of choice which the&s;e people do of ne|ce&s;&s;ity. They mu&s;t by exerci&s;e, &s;ubject them&s;elves to a kind of voluntary la|bour.</P>
<P>As this di&s;cour&s;e is addre&s;&s;ed chiefly to the rich and the luxurious, who are the mo&s;t given to idlene&s;s, I &s;hall con|fine my&s;elf to exerci&s;e only; and, in or|der to handle the &s;ubject in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive manner, I &s;hall con&s;ider</P>

<P N="2">II. THE PROPER TIME FOR USING IT; and then I &s;hall conclude with an APPLICATION.</P>
<P N="1">I. All Exerci&s;e may be divided into ACTIVE and PASSIVE.</P>
<P>ACTIVE EXERCISE includes walking &mdash;running&mdash;dancing&mdash;fencing&mdash;&s;wim|ming, and the like.</P>
<P>PASSIVE EXERCISE includes &s;ailing &mdash;riding in a carriage, and on hor&s;eback.

The la&s;t of the&s;e it of a mixed nature, and is in &s;ome mea&s;ure active as well as pa&s;&s;ive. We &s;hall treat of each of them in order.</P>
<P>OF ACTIVE EXERCISE.</P>
<P>WALKING is the mo&s;t gentle &s;pecies of it we are acquainted with. It pro|motes per&s;piration, and if not continued too long, invigorates and &s;trengthens the &s;y&s;tem. As the mo&s;t &s;imple and whole&s;ome drink, namely water, is with|in every body's reach, &s;o this &s;pecies of &s;imple and whole&s;ome exerci&s;e is in e|very body's power, who has the u&s;e of his limbs. It is to be lamented, that carriages are too often &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of it. At Pekin in China, we are told, that none but the emperor, and a few of the fir&s;t officers of &s;tate, are &s;uf|fered to u&s;e chariots. Although the intention of this law was to &s;uppre&s;s the number of hor&s;es, in order to make room for the increa&s;e and &s;upport of the hu|man &s;pecies, in the number of which the riches of all countries con&s;i&s;t, yet we find it attended with good effects otherwi&s;e; for the rich and the great, by being obliged to walk in common

with the poor people, enjoy with them the common ble&s;&s;ing of health, more than people of the &s;ame rank in other countries. To &s;uch as can be<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> it, I would recommend walking frequently up a hill. The inhabitants of moun|tainous countries are generally healthy and long-lived. This is commonly at|tributed to the purity of the air in &s;uch places. Although this has a <HI>chief</HI> &s;hare in it, yet I cannot help thinking, that the frequent and nece&s;&s;ary exerci&s;e of climb|ing mountains, which the&s;e people are obliged to undergo, adds much to their health and lives. Every body knows how much walking up a hill tends to create an appetite. This depends upon its increa&s;ing the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration: &mdash;an excretion with which the appetite, and the &s;tate of the &s;tomach in general, are much connected.</P>
<P>RUNNING is too violent to be u&s;ed often, or continued for any length of time. The running-footmen in all coun|tries are &s;hort-lived:&mdash;Few of them e&s;|cape con&s;umptions before they arrive at their thirty-fifth year.&mdash;Sweating and per&s;piration, according to Sanctorius,
<PB N="48" REF="023758_0048_0FC0F0A79B75ADA8">
have been found to be incompatible:&mdash; The former always &s;uppre&s;&s;es the latter. Upon this account, I would recommend it to be u&s;ed as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>DANCING is a mo&s;t &s;alutary exerci&s;e. Future ages will be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear, that rational creatures &s;hould, at any time, have looked upon it as a criminal amu&s;ement. To rea&s;on again&s;t it, from its abu&s;e, concludes equally &s;trong a|gain&s;t the lawfulne&s;s of every thing we hold &s;acred and valuable in life.&mdash;It was a part of the Jewi&s;h wor&s;hip. By its mechanical effects on the body, it in&s;pires the mind with cheerfulne&s;s; and this, when well founded, and properly re&s;trained, is another name for religion. It is common among the Indians, and the &s;avage nations of all countries, upon public and fe&s;tive occa&s;ions.&mdash;They have their war&mdash;their love&mdash;and their religious dances. The mu&s;ic, which always accompanies this exerci&s;e, hath a plea&s;ing and &s;alutary effect upon the body as well as the mind It is ad|dre&s;&s;ed through the avenue of the ears to the brain, the common centre of life and motion, from whence its o&s;cillati|ons
<PB N="49" REF="023758_0049_0FC0F0A94A0F2E18">
are communicated to every part of the &s;y&s;tem, imparting to each that equal and uniform vigour and action, upon which the healthy &s;tate of all the functi|ons depends. It would lead us to a long digre&s;&s;ion, or I might here menti|on many remarkable cures which have been performed, particularly of tho&s;e di&s;orders, which are much connected with the nervous &s;y&s;tem, by the magic power of mu&s;ic. Dancing &s;hould not be u&s;ed more than once or twice a week. It &s;hould never be continued till wea|rine&s;s comes on, nor &s;hould we expo&s;e our&s;elves to the cold air too &s;oon after it.</P>
<P>FENCING calls forth mo&s;t of the mu&s;|cles into exerci&s;e, particularly tho&s;e which move the limbs. The brain is likewi&s;e rou&s;ed by it, through the avenue of the eyes; and its action, as in the ca&s;e of mu&s;ic, is propagated to the whole &s;y&s;tem. It has long been a &s;ubject of complaint, that the human &s;pecies has been degenerating for the&s;e &s;everal cen|turies. When we &s;ee the coats of mail of our ance&s;tors, who fought under Ed|wards and Heneries of former ages, we wonder how they moved, much more
<PB N="50" REF="023758_0050_0FC0F0B6312EBE78">
how they atchieved &s;uch great exploits, beneath the weight of &s;uch ma&s;&s;y cover|ings. We grant that rum&mdash;tobacco &mdash;tea&mdash;and &s;ome other luxuries of modern invention, have had a large &s;hare in weakning the &s;tamina of our con&s;titutions, and thus producing a more feeble race of men; yet we mu&s;t attri|bute much of our great inferiority in &s;trength, &s;ize and agility to our fore-fa|thers, to the di&s;u&s;e which the invention of gun-powder and fire-arms hath in|troduced of tho&s;e athletic exerci&s;es, which were &s;o much practi&s;ed in former ages, as a part of military di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>Too much cannot be &s;aid in prai&s;e of SWIMMING, or as the poet of Avon expre&s;&s;es it&mdash;"buffeting the waves with lu&s;ty &s;inews." Be&s;ides exerci&s;ing the limbs, it &s;erves to wa&s;h away the du&s;t, which is apt to mix it&s;elf with the &s;weat of our bodies in warm weather. Wa&s;h|ing frequently in water, we find, was enjoined upon the Jews and Mahome|tans, as a part of their religious ceremo|nies. The Hollanders are cleanly in their hou&s;es and &s;treets, without remem|bering, or perhaps knowing, that clean|line&s;s

was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t, to guard again&s;t the effects of tho&s;e inun|dations of mire, to which their country is always expo&s;ed:&mdash;&s;o a Jew and a Mu&s;&s;ulman contend for, and practi&s;e their ablutions, without remembering that they were in&s;tituted only to guard them again&s;t tho&s;e cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, to which the con&s;tant accumulation of &s;ordes upon their &s;kins in a warm cli|mate, naturally expo&s;ed them. For the &s;ame rea&s;on I would &s;trongly recom|mend the practice of bathing and &s;wim|ming, frequently in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. But remember, you &s;hould not &s;tay too long in the water at one time, lea&s;t you le&s;&s;en in&s;tead of increa&s;ing the vigour of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e &s;pecies of exerci&s;e which we have mentioned, I would add, SKEATING, JUMPING, al&s;o, the active plays of TENNIS, BOWLES, QUOITS, GOLF<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Golf is an exerci&s;e which is much u&s;ed by the gentlemen in Scotland. A large common, in which there are &s;everal little holes, is cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e. It is played with little leather balls &s;tuffed with feathers; and &s;ticks tipped with horn. He who puts a ball into a given number of holes, with the fewe&s;t &s;trokes, gets the game. The late Dr. M'KENZIE, Author of the E&s;&s;ay on Health and Long Life, u&s;ed to &s;ay, That a man would live ten years the longer for u&s;ing this exerci&s;e once or twice a week.</NOTE>, and the like. The manner in

which each of the&s;e operate, may be under&s;tood from what we &s;aid under the former particulars.</P>
<P>Active exerci&s;e includes, in the la&s;t place, TALKING&mdash;READING with an AUDIBLE VOICE&mdash;&mdash;SINGING and LAUGHING. They all promote the circulation of the blood through the lungs, and tend to &s;trengthen tho&s;e im|portant organs, when u&s;ed in moderati|on. The la&s;t has the advantage over them all, ina&s;much as the mind co-ope|rates with it. May unfading laurels bloom to the late&s;t ages upon the grave of him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sterne.</NOTE> who &s;aid, "That every time a man laughs, he adds &s;omething to his life."</P>
<P>I would remark here, that all the&s;e &s;pecies of exerci&s;e which we have de|&s;cribed, &s;hould be varied according to
<PB N="53" REF="023758_0053_0FC0F0C2747BFD48">
age&mdash;&s;ex&mdash;temperament&mdash;climate, and &s;ea&s;on. Young people &s;tand in le&s;s need of exerci&s;e than old:&mdash;Women le&s;s than men. The natural vigour of their con&s;titutions is &s;uch, that they &s;uf|fer <HI>lea&s;t</HI> from the want of it. This will explain the meaning, and &s;how the pro|priety of an opinion of a modern Phi|lo&s;opher<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rou&s;&s;eau.</NOTE>, that "Women only &s;hould follow tho&s;e mechanical arts which re|quire a &s;edentary life." But again, a man, who is phlegmatic, requires more frequent and violent exerci&s;e than he who is of a bilious con&s;titution: And la&s;tly, people in warm climates and &s;ea|&s;ons, require le&s;s than tho&s;e who live in cold. As Providence, by &s;upplying the inhabitants of warm climates with &s;o many of the &s;pontaneous fruits of the earth, &s;eems to have intended they &s;hould labour le&s;s than the inhabitants of cold climates; &s;o we may infer from this, that le&s;s exerci&s;e, which is only a &s;ub&s;titute for labour, is nece&s;&s;ary for them. The heat of &s;uch climates is &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to keep up a regular and due per&s;piration. We &s;aid in a
<PB N="54" REF="023758_0054_0FC0F0C42F3A1298">
former di&s;cour&s;e, that the longe&s;t-lived people were to be found in warm cli|mates, and we gave one conjecture into the cau&s;e of it. It may not be impro|per here to add another. The cold|ne&s;s of northern climates, from the vi|gour it gives to the con&s;titution, prompts to all kinds of exerci&s;e, which are not always re&s;trained within proper bounds. The&s;e, when u&s;ed to exce&s;s, wear out the body. Thus, blowing a fire, may cau&s;e it to burn the brighter, but it con&s;umes it the &s;ooner. The inhabitants of warm climates being le&s;s prompted to the&s;e things, their bodies continue longer un|impaired. I confine this ob&s;ervation, as in the former in&s;tance, to the improv|ed parts of A&s;ia and Africa only. The inhabitants of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands are &s;o mixed, and partake &s;o much of the European manners, that we cannot as yet include them in any general re|marks which are made upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I come next to &s;peak of tho&s;e exer|ci&s;es which are of a PASSIVE NATURE. The&s;e are proper chiefly for valetudi|narians: but, as I intend the&s;e &s;ermons &s;hould be of u&s;e to them as well as the
<PB N="55" REF="023758_0055_0FC0F0C7D7761E68">
healthy, I &s;hall make a few remarks upon each of them.</P>
<P>The life of a SAILOR is environed with &s;o many dangers, that Heaven has, in compen&s;ation for them, connected with it an exemption from many di&s;ea&s;|es. In vain do the angry elements a&s;|&s;ault him. His body, like &s;ome huge promontory, is proof again&s;t them all. Notwith&s;tanding the dangers from &s;hip|wreck&mdash;fire&mdash;falling over-board&mdash;and famine, to which &s;ailors are expo&s;ed, I believe, that if we were to count an hundred &s;ailors, and the &s;ame number of people on land, in a place that was ordinarily healthy, we &s;hould find more of the former alive at the end of ten years than the latter. The exerci&s;e of SAILING is con&s;tant. Every mu&s;cle is occa&s;ionally brought into exerci&s;e from the efforts we make to keep our&s;elves from falling. The&s;e efforts continue to be exerted by the olde&s;t &s;ailors, al|though the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the mind in the&s;e, as well as in many other actions we perform, is not ob&s;erved from the influence of habit. By means of this regular and gentle exerci&s;e, the blood
<PB N="56" REF="023758_0056_0FC0F0CBCE033050">
is moved in tho&s;e &s;mall capillary ve&s;&s;els, where it is mo&s;t apt to &s;tagnate, and per&s;piration is increa&s;ed, which is car|ried off as fa&s;t as it is di&s;charged from the body, by the con&s;tant change of at|mo&s;phere in a &s;hip under &s;ail. I &s;ay nothing here of the benefit of the &s;ea air, it being entirely negative. Its vir|tue, both at &s;ea and on the &s;ea-&s;hore, con&s;i&s;ts in nothing but its being freed from tho&s;e noxious animal and vegeta|ble effluvia, which abound in the air which comes acro&s;s land. From what has been &s;aid, you will no longer be &s;urpri&s;ed at the uncommon appetite which &s;ome people feel at &s;ea. It is owing to the great and con&s;tant di&s;|charge of the aliment (after it has un|dergone its u&s;ual changes) by means of per&s;piration. I would recommend this &s;pecies of exerci&s;e to con&s;umptive peo|ple, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as labour under a &s;pitting of blood. Dr. Lind tells us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on the means of pre&s;erving the health of &s;eamen.</NOTE>, "That out of 5741 &s;ailors who were admitted into the naval ho&s;pital at Ha&s;|lar, near Port&s;mouth, in two years, only
<PB N="57" REF="023758_0057_0FC0F0CD0E843F60">
360 of them had con&s;umptions, and in one fourth of the&s;e (he &s;ays) it was brought on by brui&s;es or falls." In the &s;ame number of ho&s;pital patients, in this or any other country, I am per|&s;uaded &s;ix times that number would have been con&s;umptive&mdash;&s;o much does the gentle exerci&s;e of &s;ailing fortify the lungs again&s;t all accidents, and deter|mine the quantity and force of the flu|ids towards the &s;urface of the body.</P>
<P>RIDING IN A CHARIOT has but few advantages, ina&s;much as we are exclu|ded from the benefit of fre&s;h air; an article, upon which the &s;ucce&s;s of all kinds of exerci&s;e in a great mea&s;ure de|pends. It &s;hould be u&s;ed only by &s;uch per&s;ons as are unable to walk or to ride on hor&s;eback. We cannot help lamen|ting here, that tho&s;e people u&s;e this mode of exerci&s;e the mo&s;t, who &s;tand in the greate&s;t need of a more violent &s;pecies of it.</P>
<P>RIDING ON HORSEBACK is the mo&s;t manly and u&s;eful &s;pecies of exerci&s;e for gentlemen. Bi&s;hop Burnet expre&s;&s;es his &s;urprize at the lawyers of his own

time being &s;o much more long-lived <HI>(caeteris paribus)</HI> than other people, con|&s;idering how much tho&s;e of them who become eminent in their profe&s;&s;ion, are obliged to devote them&s;elves to con&s;tant and inten&s;e &s;tudy. He attributes it en|tirely to their RIDING the circuits &s;o frequently, to attend the different courts in every part of the kingdom. This, no doubt, has a chief &s;hare in it: but we &s;hall hereafter mention another cau&s;e which concurs with this, to protract their lives. It may be varied according to our &s;trength, or the nature of our di&s;|order, by walking&mdash;pacing&mdash;trotting or cantering our hor&s;e. All tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which are attended with a weakne&s;s of the nerves, &s;uch as the hy&s;teric and hypo|chondriac di&s;orders, which &s;how them|&s;elves in a weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach and bowels&mdash;indige&s;tion&mdash;low &s;pirits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> require this exerci&s;e. It &s;hould be u&s;ed with caution in the con&s;umption, and &s;hould never be violent, nor continued too long at a time. In riding, to pre|&s;erve health, eight or ten miles a day are &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es we would wi&s;h for. But in riding, to
<PB N="59" REF="023758_0059_0FC0F0D311712DF0">
re&s;tore health, the&s;e little excur&s;ions will avail nothing. The mind, as well as the body, mu&s;t be rou&s;ed from its lan|gour. In <HI>taking an airing,</HI> as it is cal|led, we ride over the &s;ame ground for the mo&s;t part every day. We &s;ee no new objects to divert us, and the very con&s;ideration of our riding for health &s;inks our &s;pirits &s;o much, that we receive more harm than good from it. Upon this account I would recommend long journies to &s;uch people, in order, by the variety or novelty of the journey, to a|waken and divert the mind. Many people have by the&s;e means been &s;ur|pri&s;ed into health. Per&s;ons who labour under hy&s;teric or epileptic di&s;orders, &s;hould be &s;ent to cold, tho&s;e who labour under hypochondriac or con&s;umptive complaints &s;hould vi&s;it warm climates.</P>
<P>Before I fini&s;h this head of our di&s;|cour&s;e, I &s;hall add a few words con|cerning the exerci&s;e of the faculties of the &s;oul. The mind and body have a reciprocal action upon each other. Are our pa&s;&s;ions inflamed with de&s;ire or a|ver&s;ion? Or does our rea&s;on trace out relations in tho&s;e things which are the
<PB N="60" REF="023758_0060_0FC0F0D9373FE3F0">
objects of our under&s;tanding?&mdash;The bo|dy, we find, is brought into &s;ympathy. The pul&s;e and the circulation of the blood are immediately quickened, per|&s;piration and the other &s;ecretions are promoted, and the body is in&s;en&s;ibly in|vigorated afterwards. The body par|takes therefore of the torpor which the mind contracts by its neglecting to ex|erci&s;e its faculties. He mu&s;t be but lit|tle acquainted with biography, who has not remarked, that &s;uch as have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in the literary world, have generally been long-lived. AD|DISON, SWIFT, LOCKE, NEWTON, FRANKLIN, with many others whom we might mention, all found a retreat, in the evening of their lives, under the &s;hade of laurels which they had planted in their youth. Perhaps, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, they might promi&s;e them&s;elves an ex|emption from di&s;ea&s;es, and a death from mere old age, could they be per&s;uaded to relinqui&s;h their midnight lamp be|fore the oil which feeds it was con&s;u|med. Great care &s;hould be taken, there|fore, to avoid too great application of the mind to &s;tudy. The mo&s;t powerful

medicines in nature are the mo&s;t cer|tain poi&s;ons. Many promi&s;ing geniu&s;es have &s;acrificed them&s;elves, before they arrived at the altar in the Temple of Fame. Such as are in danger of &s;uf|fering from this cau&s;e, will do well in con&s;ulting the ingenious and humane Dr. Ti&s;&s;ot's excellent treati&s;e upon the di&s;ea&s;es of literary people. The PAS|SIONS, as well as our rea&s;on, &s;hould al|ways be exerci&s;ed as much as po&s;&s;ible. We &s;hall walk, run, dance, &s;wim, fence, &s;ail, and ride to little purpo&s;e, unle&s;s we make choice of an agreeable friend to accompany us. Solitude is the bane of man; in&s;omuch, that it is difficult to tell which &s;uffers mo&s;t, the &s;oul in its qualities, or the body in its tempera|ment, from being alone. Too great a concour&s;e of people breeds di&s;ea&s;es. Too much company is de&s;tructive to cheerfulne&s;s. For the &s;ake of both mind and body, therefore, we &s;hould move in a little circle, and let heaven circum&s;cribe it for us. Let over wives and children be always around us, or, if we are not ble&s;&s;ed with the&s;e, let a few chearful friends be our con&s;tant

companions. It is remarked, that more &s;ingle people die among tho&s;e who are come to manhood than married, and all phy&s;icians agree, that &s;ingle men and women compo&s;e by far the greate&s;t num|ber of their chronic patients among a|dults. Some men may talk again&s;t the cares of a family. They are unavoid|able, it is true, but they are nece&s;&s;ary. Stagnating waters are never &s;weet.&mdash; Thus, the&s;e little cares, by keeping the tender pa&s;&s;ions always agitated, prevent that uniformity in life, which is &s;o fo|reign and di&s;agreeable both to the body and mind. After all, I believe I &s;hall have the &s;uffrages of mo&s;t of my hearers, when I add, that they are at lea&s;t ba|lanced by the &s;weets of dome&s;tic friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>We come now to the next head of our di&s;cour&s;e, namely,</P>
<P N="2">II. To enquire into the proper TIME for EXERCISES.&mdash;Sanctorius informs us<NOTE PLACE="foot">Sect. V. Aphori&s;m VII.</NOTE>, that "exerci&s;e, from the &s;eventh to the eleventh hour after eating, wa&s;tes more in&s;en&s;ibly in one hour, than in three at
<PB N="63" REF="023758_0063_0FC0F0E22A4BCA10">
any other time." If this be true, then (&s;uppo&s;ing you &s;up at eight o'clock in the evening) that exerci&s;e which is u&s;ed from five till &s;even o'clock in the morn|ing, will promote the greate&s;t di&s;charge in a given time, by in&s;en&s;ible per&s;pira|tion. Such as make dinner their prin|cipal meal, are excluded from the be|nefit of this aphori&s;m; as the interval, between the &s;eventh and the eleventh hour, with them (&s;uppo&s;ing they dine at two o'clock in the afternoon) is from nine in the evening till one o'clock in the morning&mdash;a time, in which darkne&s;s, and the unwhole&s;ome night air, forbid walking&mdash;riding&mdash;and almo&s;t every o|ther &s;pecies of manly exerci&s;e we have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>I know it will be objected here, that we often &s;ee labourers return, after a full meal, to their work, without feeling any inconvenience from it. This is like the argument of tho&s;e who recom|mend raw fle&s;h to the human &s;pecies, becau&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t and fierce&s;t ani|mals in nature eat it. It is becau&s;e they are &s;o fierce and &s;o &s;trong, that they are able to dige&s;t raw &s;tein. In like
<PB N="64" REF="023758_0064_0FC0F0E8C12AB4C0">
manner it is, becau&s;e the&s;e men are na|turally &s;o &s;trong, that labour immedi|ately after eating does not hurt them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">O! dura me&s;&s;orum ilia. <HI>Hor. Epod. III.</HI></NOTE>. But let me a&s;k, whether you have not ob&s;erved &s;uch people leave their tables with reluctance?&mdash;how &s;lowly do they return&mdash;and how many excu&s;es do they form to loitor away a little time, before they renew their work?</P>
<P>But further&mdash;there is another rea&s;on why I would recommend this practice of eating the chief meal in the evening, which is indeed a little foreign to our pre&s;ent &s;ubject.&mdash;In a country like this, where the con&s;tant labour of every indi|vidual is &s;o very nece&s;&s;ary, the general u&s;e of this cu&s;tom would add &s;everal hours to every day, and thus have the mo&s;t beneficial effects upon the agricul|ture&mdash;commerce&mdash;and manufactures of the country, exclu&s;ive of its influence upon the health of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid, I need hardly add, that exerci&s;e &s;hould never be u&s;ed with a full &s;tomach. Per&s;ons who u&s;e exerci&s;e, either to pre&s;erve or
<PB N="65" REF="023758_0065_0FC0F0E98F8D1FF8">
re&s;tore health, immediately after eating a hearty meal, re&s;emble the man "who fled from a lion, and a bear met him; and who went into the hou&s;e, and lean|ed his hand upon the wall, and a &s;erpent bit him."</P>
<P>I come now to the APPLICATION of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured, in every part of it, to lay before you the mo&s;t powerful arguments, to excite you to exerci&s;e, and have addre&s;&s;ed them chiefly to that main &s;pring of human actions&mdash;SELF-PRE|SERVATION. I have taught you the true art of alchymy, and furni&s;hed you with the genuine philo&s;opher's &s;tone; but with this difference from that which has been &s;ought for, by the deluded pretenders of philo&s;ophy in all ages, that, in&s;tead of converting, like Midas, every thing you touch into gold, every thing which touches you &s;hall&mdash;not convert you into gold, but impart HEALTH to you&mdash;compared with which, even the gold of Ophir lo&s;es its weight. In a word&mdash;I have &s;howed you an harbour where I have anchored &s;afely for many
<PB N="66" REF="023758_0066_0FC0F0ED7677F070">
years; for, from my youth upwards, I have followed the mode of living I have recommended to you, as far as my con|nections or intercour&s;e with the world would admit; and although I received from nature a weakly con&s;titution, yet &mdash;I &s;peak it with a grateful heart!&mdash; few men enjoy better health&mdash;none bet|ter &s;pirits&mdash;than my&s;elf; and was I now about to leave the world, &s;urrounded with a family of children, I would charge them, among the mo&s;t important le&s;&s;ons I &s;hould give them, to bind the&s;e things as "a &s;ign upon their hands, or as front|le&s;s between their eyes"&mdash;to think of them "when they &s;at in their hou&s;es, and when they walked by the way&mdash; when they lay down, and when they ro&s;e up&mdash;that their days might be mul|tiplied; and that the days of their chil|dren might be as the days of heaven upon the earth."</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with a &s;tory, which, I hope, will not be looked upon as foreign to what has been deli|vered upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the i&s;land of Ceylon, in the Indian ocean, a number of invalids were a&s;|&s;embled

together, who were afflicted with mo&s;t of the chronic di&s;ea&s;es to which the human body is &s;ubject. In the mid&s;t of them &s;at &s;everal venerable figures, who amu&s;ed them with encomi|ums upon &s;ome medicines, which they a&s;&s;ured them would afford infallible re|lief in all ca&s;es. One boa&s;ted of an elixir&mdash;another of a powder, brought from America&mdash;a third, of a medicine, invented and prepared in Germany&mdash; all of which, they &s;aid, were certain antidotes for the gout&mdash;a fourth cried up a no&s;trum for the vapours&mdash;a fifth, drops for the gravel&mdash;a &s;ixth, a bal&s;am, prepared from honey, as a &s;overeign remedy for a con&s;umption&mdash;a &s;eventh, a pill for cutaneous eruptions&mdash;while an eighth cried down the whole, and extolled a mineral water, which lay a few miles from the place where they were a&s;&s;embled. The credulous mul|titude partook eagerly of the&s;e medi|cines, but without any relief of their re&s;pective complaints. Several of tho&s;e, who made u&s;e of the German preparation, were hurried &s;uddenly out of the world. Some &s;aid their medicines were adulte|rated

Upon looking up, a light was &s;een in the &s;ky.&mdash;In the mid&s;t of this appeared the figure of &s;omething more than human&mdash;&s;he was tall and comely&mdash;her &s;kin was fair as the driven &s;now&mdash;a ro&s;y hue tinged her cheeks&mdash; her hair hung loo&s;e upon her &s;houlders&mdash; her flowing robes di&s;clo&s;ed a &s;hape which would have ca&s;t a &s;hade upon the &s;tatue of Venus of Medicis.&mdash;In her right hand &s;he held a bough of an EVERGREEN &mdash;in her left hand &s;he had a &s;croll of parchment&mdash;&s;he de&s;cended &s;lowly, and &s;tood erect upon the earth&mdash;&s;he fixed her eyes, which &s;parkled with life, upon the deluded and afflicted company&mdash; there was a mixture of pity and indig|nation in her countenance&mdash;&s;he &s;tretch|ed forth her right arm, and, with a voice which was &s;weeter than melody it&s;elf, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed them in the following

One of them approached with reverence to the &s;pot where &s;he &s;tood&mdash;took up the &s;croll, and read the contents of it to his companions. It contained directions to each of them, what they &s;hould do to re&s;tore their health. They all prepared them&s;elves to obey the advice of the heavenly vi&s;ion. The gouty man broke his vial of elixir, threw his powders in|to the fire, and walked four or five miles every day before breakfa&s;t. The man afflicted with the gravel threw a&s;ide his drops, and began to work in his garden, or to play two or three hours every day at bowls. The hypochondriac and hy&s;|teric patients di&s;charged their boxes of a&s;&s;afoetida, and took a journey on hor&s;e|back, to di&s;tant and oppo&s;ite ends of the i&s;land.

One had renewed his youth&mdash;another had recovered the u&s;e of his limbs&mdash;a third, who had been half bent for many years, now walked upright&mdash;a fourth began to &s;ing &s;ome jovial &s;ong, without being a&s;ked&mdash;a fifth could talk for hours together without being interrupted with a cough&mdash;in a word, they all enjoyed now a complete recovery of their health.
