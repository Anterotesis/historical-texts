<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE EIGHTH EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>A<HI>S this way of writing, in ca&s;es not much unlike this, has been approved of, and has met with great &s;ucce&s;s in other hands; it has been an encouragement to this under|taking.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hi&s;torical dialogues, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, have a very taking elegancy in them, and the &s;tory being handed forward in &s;hort periods, and quick returns, makes the retaining it in the mind the ea&s;ier, and the impre&s;&s;ion the more la&s;ting as well as delightful.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The &s;tory repre&s;ented here is capable of &s;uch, and &s;o many applications to the ca&s;es of young people, who&s;e &s;ettlement is always in view, that there will never be a time when the in&s;truction will be u&s;ele&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If any body &s;hould object, that too much is put here upon the woman's part, and that a lady cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, in the mid&s;t of her
<PB N="iv" REF="025384_0003_0FCCDD5B527E7B58">
lover's addre&s;&s;es, to take upon her, to demand &s;uch an account of him&s;elf as is here &s;ugge&s;t|ed; that few men will &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oop to &s;uch an exami|nation; and few women venture the lo&s;s of their lovers upon &s;uch a &s;ubject: Let &s;uch con&s;ider how &s;mall the &s;atisfaction here pro|po&s;ed on the lady's part is, and that no gentle|man can think it hard a woman &s;hould be &s;atisfied whether he is a Chri&s;tian or a Hea|then; a man of religion or an Athie&s;t: and indeed, no man of any tolerable &s;hare of &s;en&s;e, will addre&s;s him&s;elf to a lady for marriage, but he will take care to anticipate her inqui|ries of that kind, by &s;hewing &s;ome concern, for knowing what &s;he is her&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The univer&s;al neglect of this trifle, both in men and women, is what this book is de&s;igned to correct, and there needs no greater &s;atire upon that part, than the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;everal ca&s;es here related, viz. The happy life of the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, who came into the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed; and the mi&s;erable condition of the &s;econd &s;i&s;ter, who ra&s;hly threw her&s;elf into the arms of a man of different principles from her own, though ble&s;t with all the good hu|mour in the world.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> accounts, the very great con&s;e|quence of being equally yoked is illu&s;trated; and it appears here how e&s;&s;ential a &s;hare of religion, and a harmony of principles in re|ligion, are to the felicity of a conjugal life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To tho&s;e who do not ca&s;t off all concern for them&s;elves; who do not make marrying a

mere leap in the dark, and as the fir&s;t lady expre&s;&s;es it, ru&s;h like a hor&s;e into the battle, the&s;e things will be of &s;ome moment. As to tho&s;e that are void of care of the&s;e matters, they mu&s;t go on, and pay for their experience; let them take heed, and buy it as cheap as they can.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If the women &s;eem to be favoured in this &s;tory, and have the better part of the &s;taff put into their hands, it is becau&s;e really the ha|zard is chiefly on their &s;ide, and they are ge|nerally the greate&s;t &s;ufferers in the &s;ucce&s;s: but if it were otherwi&s;e, yet, if they are treat|ed with more than ordinary regard, the au|thor hopes they will not lay that &s;in to his charge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The appendix to this work &s;peaks for it&s;elf: Irreligious &s;ervants, in &s;ome re&s;pects, are the plague of families, and keep our hou&s;es al|ways in di&s;order. It is a wonderful thing to reflect on, that &s;o &s;candalous an evil, &s;o ea&s;y to be rectified, &s;hould have gone to &s;uch a de|gree as it has in the world; and that ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families, have not long ago, for their own ea&s;e, and for the &s;atisfaction of one another, come to a general law, for the managing, the puni&s;hing, and above all, for the recommending of &s;ervants; which if they would do, they would ea&s;ily, I &s;ay, bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to know them&s;elves, and do their duty; nei|ther of which is the ca&s;e among &s;ervants at this time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But it is all our own faults; we recommend

&s;luts, and thieves, and drones, and &s;aucy, in|&s;olent fellows, and wenches: I &s;ay, we recom|mend them to one another, without any con|cern for our neighbour's &s;afety or peace; in a word, to pay the debt of charity for tho&s;e creatures who have abu&s;ed us, we forget the debt of ju&s;tice to one another, and betray the confidence which one hou&s;e-keeper and neigh|bour owes to another, in one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial articles of their families' quiet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This is all expo&s;ed here; and though this part is very &s;hort, being but an accident to the other di&s;cour&s;es; yet, I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, it will be as acceptable, and, in its kind, as u&s;eful as any of the re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This eighth edition of this work, recom|mends it&s;elf upon this expre&s;s condition, viz. That the author has not found occa&s;ion to alter any thing in the &s;eventh (errors of the pre&s;s excepted), nor have I found room for any ad|ditions, that u&s;ual pretence to &s;et off new im|pre&s;&s;ions, and impo&s;e upon tho&s;e who have bought the fir&s;t; being &s;till fully &s;atisfied, the goodne&s;s of the de&s;ign and the u&s;efulne&s;s of &s;ubject, will make the work acceptable where|ever it comes.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE lived in a village near London, an an|cient, grave gentleman, of a good e&s;tate, which he had gained by trade, having been bred a merchant, though of a very good family too. He had been a man in great bu&s;ine&s;s, but his circum&s;tances being ea&s;y, and his love of a retired life increa&s;ing with his years, he had left off his bu&s;ine&s;s, and taken a hou&s;e a mile or two out of town. He was a widower at the time of this affair, his wife having been dead &s;ome years before.</P>
<P>He had five or &s;ix children; and all grown up, but none &s;ettled in the world, though he had an e&s;tate &s;uffi|cient to give them very plentiful fortunes. His three daughters were very agreeable women: and, which was &s;till better, were very &s;ober, mode&s;t, &s;en&s;ible, and religious young ladies; two of them e&s;pecially. And, as the character of their father, and the fortune he was able to give them, recommended them very well to the world; &s;o they had &s;everal gentlemen that made ho|nourable and hand&s;ome propo&s;als to their father for their marriage.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mo&s;t carefully avoid giving any room here, &s;o much as to gue&s;s what opinion in religion they were bred up in, or whether the old gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> or a di&s;&s;enter: and the &s;ame caution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> with all the re&s;t of the per&s;ons whom I &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the &s;tage in the cour&s;e of this &s;tory: my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for which every body will under&s;tand by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> relation, and of the times we live in.</P>
<P>The father of the&s;e ladies had been a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">,
<PB N="8" REF="025384_0007_0FCCDE5762BBC4F8">
till now, hurried in the world; being crowded with a va&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, taken up with getting money, and with growing rich; &s;o that he neither had much concern for, nor indeed took any care of the education or in&s;truction of his children, but left them wholly to the conduct of their mother. Nor was it any great lo&s;s to the children, e&s;pecially to the daughters; their mother being a mo&s;t pious, religious, and virtuous lady; who was not only extraordinarily qualified to in&s;truct her children, but gave up her whole time to it from their childhood.</P>
<P>One morning, a little before her death, calling her daughters to her, &s;he told them, among other things, That as to marriage, &s;he had but two injunctions to lay upon them, which, as &s;he was not likely to live to &s;ee them &s;ettled, &s;he would de&s;ire them to lay down as maxims in the choice of their hu&s;bands, and which &s;he would, as upon her death-bed, if her words had any ex|traordinary influence upon them, oblige them to ob&s;erve &s;trictly, viz.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Never to marry any man, whatever his per&s;on or fortune might be, that did not, at lea&s;t, profe&s;s to be a religious man.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> Never to marry any man, how religious &s;o|ever he may &s;eem to he, if he was not of the &s;ame prin|ciple and opinion in religion as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And as this was but a little before her death, &s;o the daughters were more than ordinarily touched with the &s;en&s;e of it, and re&s;olved to pur&s;ue it exactly. How they did pur&s;ue it, and the con&s;equences of it, will be &s;een in the following dialogues.</P>
<P>It followed &s;ome time after, that a gentleman of a very good e&s;tate courted the younge&s;t of the&s;e daughters; and making very hand&s;ome propo&s;als to her father [for he offered to &s;ettle 600l, per annum upon her] the father was exceedingly plea&s;ed with the match; he being a gentleman thoroughly well bred, an agree|able per&s;on, and, in a word, nothing appearing to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he lea&s;t rea&s;on, why he &s;hould not be as acceptable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e lady as he was to the father.</P>
<P>As he came thus recommended to the father, there appeared nothing di&s;agreeable in it to the young lady;
<PB N="9" REF="025384_0008_0FCCDE58D402ECC0">
nor had &s;he at his fir&s;t appearance the lea&s;t exception to make again&s;t the gentleman as to his per&s;on. Indeed, as to his e&s;tate, though her fortune was very hand&s;ome, yet his was &s;o far beyond it, that there was no compa|ri&s;on in the ca&s;e; and be&s;ides all this, &s;he had this en|gaging circum&s;tance in the propo&s;al, viz. That &s;he being the younge&s;t of the three daughters, the gentleman had pa&s;&s;ed over, her two elde&s;t &s;i&s;ters, and had &s;ingled her out by his more particular fancy, giving her that unde|niable mark of his affection, viz. That &s;he would be the wi&s;e of his choice, and con&s;equently &s;hould have an un|common &s;ecurity of the &s;incerity of his love to her.</P>
<P>The father oppo&s;ed his propo&s;al a little at fir&s;t, as a &s;light offered to his elde&s;t daughters; but the gentle|man told him, That he hoped, if he accepted his de&s;ign of coming into his family, he would give him leave to take the per&s;on his judgment had made choice of, and that he thought he might be happy with: That it would be a very hard circum&s;tance to him, and what he could not think of with patience, to marry one of his daughters, and be in love with another: That he was very far from offering any &s;light to the elde&s;t, letting him know, that happening to &s;ee the younge&s;t fir&s;t, he found &s;uch &s;uitablene&s;s, and &s;omething &s;o agreeable in her to him, that he re&s;olved to look no further: That, perhaps, if he had &s;een the elde&s;t or the &s;econd daugh|ter fir&s;t, it might have been the &s;ame thing; but that as he could not an&s;wer for the bias of his fancy, &s;o nei|ther could he an&s;wer it to his own conduct, not to chu&s;e her, that was from the fir&s;t moment he &s;aw her, the only woman in the world that he ever thought could make him happy.</P>
<P>Her father could make no return to an an&s;wer that had &s;o much weight in it, and which appeared to be &s;o &s;incere; and therefore, not acquainting his elde&s;t daughter with the de&s;ign he had to propo&s;e her to him, he took occa&s;ion to talk to them all together, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> morn|ing as they were drinking chocolate; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mer|rily with them, thus:</P>

<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, girls, you little think now, which of you all is like to be fir&s;t married. What &s;ay you, child, (turning to the younge&s;t) I hope you are content to let your elde&s;t &s;i&s;ters go before you?</P>

<SPEAKER>3d Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, Sir: I de&s;ire both my &s;i&s;ters may go before me; for I &s;ee nothing in the world to make me in ha&s;te.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what's the matter that you are &s;o out of love with all the world on a &s;udden? Is it that you think your&s;elf too good for every body, or every body too good for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; I am neither &s;o vain to think the fir&s;t, nor &s;o humble to think the la&s;t; but I de&s;ire to think of my&s;elf as I ought to think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>How is that, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, Sir, I think I live too well to change for the wor&s;e; and this is not an age to change for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> better: and therefore, I de&s;ire to be as I am.</P>

<P>Nay, Sir, I don't know: but I am very well &s;atisfied, Sir, with your fir&s;t propo&s;al, that my &s;i&s;ters may try before me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; and if you go before your &s;i&s;ters, there will be no harm done, if it be to your liking, I hope. I dare &s;ay none of your &s;i&s;ters will be angry. At which the two elde&s;t &s;aid, No, no; we &s;hall be very glad to &s;ee it. And &s;o they fell to je&s;ting with their younger &s;i&s;ter, till they almo&s;t angered her.</P>
<P>You are mighty difficult, &s;ays the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, that you fall upon the whole world, as if there was nothing good enough for you.</P>
<P>Says the &s;econd &s;i&s;ter, She will be as ea&s;ily plea&s;ed as another, I warrant her, if &s;he was talked to in earn|e&s;t. Upon which, notwith&s;tanding their father was pre&s;ent, they fell to rallying one another between je&s;t and earne&s;t, a little too warmly, as follows.</P>

<P>Child, what's the matter? What makes you &s;o concerned about it?</P>

<P>It is a &s;ad life, Sir, for a woman to have no help from her hu&s;band in things that are good, but only to have liberty for her&s;elf to be as good as &s;he will, or rather as good as &s;he can.

<P>He takes all the re&s;t upon tru&s;t.</P>

<P>But my &s;i&s;ter won't take him &s;o, I can tell him that.</P>
</SP>

</SP>

<P>If &s;he does refu&s;e him, &s;he and I &s;hall quarrel, I a&s;&s;ure you, and that very much.</P>

it may come afterwards. The man is a &s;ober, well-bred, ingenuous gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can &s;ay nothing to it, Sir, unle&s;s I knew him. I only take notice of the principle, Sir, on which my &s;i&s;ter goes; and by which I am &s;ure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he will act in this matter, that you may not be di&s;appointed, and re&s;ent it, for I know &s;he will not go from it.</P>

<SP>

<P>I'll warrant you. I intend to talk with her a|bout it. I don't doubt but &s;he will like him very well.</P>
<P>[Two or three days after this di&s;cour&s;e, the father brings home this young gentleman to dinner; and after dinner he takes occa&s;ion to talk with his daughter; and to tell her, that this was the gentleman that he had told her of, that intended to court her; and that he expected &s;he would think of the thing, and receive him as her own inclinations, and his merit, &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>The gentleman did not di&s;cour&s;e much with her by her&s;elf that time, having no de&s;ign to begin clo&s;ely at the fir&s;t view. However, he had the opportunity of walking two or three turns with her in a green walk in the gar|den; and when he took his leave, told her, he re&s;olved to wait on her again; to which &s;he made no an&s;wer for that time.</P>
<P>The next evening he came again; and after that for &s;everal evenings together; when having made her ac|quainted with his de&s;ign, and laid clo&s;e &s;iege to her for &s;ome time, &s;he found nothing to object again&s;t him; for he was indeed a mo&s;t agreeable per&s;on. And her father pre&s;&s;ing her to it on the other hand, and letting her know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> honourable propo&s;als he had made her, and how he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ingled her out from all her &s;i&s;ters, as the object of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> choice, &s;he began in&s;en&s;ibly to find her affections ve|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;trongly bia&s;&s;ed in his favour.</P>
<P>All this while &s;he could make no di&s;covery of any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing about religion in him; nor &s;o much as, whether he was well inclined or perfectly de&s;titute. The re&s;pect he &s;hewed her, and the di&s;tance &s;he kept him at, permitted him not to u&s;e any loo&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, that might give her any light into his principles; and, as he afterwards con|fe&s;&s;ed, he found her &s;o nice in things of that kind, that the lea&s;t di&s;located word would have given her offence;
<PB N="19" REF="025384_0018_0FCCE0484ACB2348">
and therefore he kept upon his guard a great while, till at length, when they become more intimate, he abated his u&s;ual caution.</P>
<P>By this time, as &s;he confe&s;&s;ed to her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he did not only like him, but really loved him; and having no|thing to object again&s;t him, had given him rea&s;on to &s;ee that &s;he de&s;igned to have him. But &s;he was under a great concern how to know what he was as to religion; and terribly afraid le&s;t &s;he &s;hould give her affections &s;uch a loo&s;e, that though &s;he &s;hould be deceived in the main point, &s;he &s;hould not be able to ma&s;ter her&s;elf, &s;o much as to go back. As &s;he was mu&s;ing very &s;eriou&s;ly upon this one morning in her chamber, her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter came in to her, and began the following di&s;cour&s;e with her.]</P>

The young lady's &s;i&s;ter was di&s;appointed in his an&s;wer; for &s;he expected he would have inquired into the particu|lars; but he put it off, as a thing that did not concern him much.

No, no, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, it was not at all from a di&s;agreement of tempers is this ca&s;e; it is wor&s;e a great deal; it was a di&s;agreement of princi|ples; for the gentleman was of a very good temper I a&s;|&s;ure you.

Her being religi|ous, &s;aid &s;he, made his want of it an in&s;ufferable burden to her. Then &s;he was to blame, &s;ays he, for what need &s;he have been unea&s;y at that? Not unea&s;y! &s;ays &s;he, How is it po&s;&s;ible a religious woman can live comforta|bly with an irreligious, profane hu&s;band! O very well, &s;ays he again, What &s;ignifies it to a woman, whether her hu&s;band have any religion or no?

<P>Her &s;i&s;ter had li&s;tened very attentively to all this, and was &s;en&s;ibly affected with it; but &s;aid nothing till now, when &s;he turned upon her &s;i&s;ter: Why &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid &s;he, &s;hould you think &s;o?

<P>Sir, this &s;eems to be an hard&s;hip that never was put upon any one before. If I was going to marry any one you did not like, it was no doubt in your power to command me not to do it; but I cannot think you ought to command me to marry any man again&s;t my will.</P>

&s;tronger rea&s;ons for de&s;iring a religious hu&s;band, than &s;he may have now; that &s;he might have a kind in&s;tructor to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. We have all need of helps that way at lea&s;t. We need no profane hu&s;bands to keep us back; a loo&s;e, irreligious hu&s;band is a dreadful &s;nare.</P>
<P>[This was a night of pa&s;&s;ion, and little was done all the evening by the father but to make work for repentance. He was &s;o provoked at his daughter, that he made terri|ble re&s;olutions again&s;t her, that he would never give her a farthing; that he would turn her out of doors; that &s;he &s;hould go to &s;ervice, that he would make his will, and whatever he left to the re&s;t of his children, it &s;hould be upon condition, that they &s;hould never relieve her, nor own her, nor call her &s;i&s;ter, and that if they did, what they had &s;hould go to his elde&s;t &s;on; and the like.</P>
<P>He was &s;o di&s;turbed, that he got but little &s;leep all night; and, in the morning, he was obliged to go out of town early to his &s;i&s;ter's, about forty miles off, who&s;e hu&s;band was ju&s;t dead; &s;o that he did not &s;ee his young|e&s;t daughter any more before he went; but ju&s;t as he was &s;tepping into his chariot, he called his elde&s;t daugh|ter to him, What, &s;ays he, child, is to be done in this affair while I am gone? She won't be &s;o rude to turn him off while I am away, will &s;he? Indeed, Sir, &s;ays the daughter, I am perplexed about it; I know not how it will be managed; but I believe &s;he will &s;ee him no more. Not &s;ee him! &s;ays the father; that is the unmannerlie&s;t thing in the world: &s;ure &s;he won't be &s;o rude to me; &s;he might give me the opportunity to put an end to it hand|&s;omely. Pray tell her, I expect it, and I a&s;&s;ure you, if &s;he refu&s;es to &s;ee him till my return, I'll never &s;ee her more as long as I live.</P>
<P>In this temper the father went away: the elde&s;t daugh|ter, poor lady, had her heart full with &s;uch a me&s;&s;age, and &s;carce knew how to deliver it; however, upon talking farther with her &s;i&s;ter the &s;ame morning, and finding her inflexible, and perhaps more &s;tiff than &s;he thought &s;he needed to be, &s;he did at la&s;t deliver it: their dialogue was &s;hort but effectual, as follows.]</P>

raillery than argument) you may find one of the&s;e two things will happen, viz. either he will talk &s;eriou&s;ly, and let you &s;ee, that he has a bottom of religious good &s;enti|ments, which is all you ought to in&s;i&s;t upon, and would be a happy di&s;covery on your &s;ide, or talk profanely, and be &s;elf convicted.</P>

It would not perhaps be po&s;&s;ible to &s;et down the particulars of the court&s;hip of this night, there being a great deal of variety in it, and nobody pre&s;ent but them|&s;elves: but the be&s;t account we have of it being from her own mouth, I have &s;et it down as &s;he related it to her &s;i&s;ter in the following dialogue.</P>

<P>Why, after we had been together about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an hour, he &s;eemed to recollect him&s;elf, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="36" REF="025384_0035_0FCCE11010BD7238">
he a&s;ked my pardon, that he had not condoled with me, for the lo&s;s of my uncle, Sir James&mdash;: I told him, he need not, for the lo&s;s was not &s;o great. He replied, he thought I appeared very much concerned at it la&s;t night, which made him withdraw &s;ooner than he intended. I told him, I was thoughtful indeed, but not &s;o much about that; for, though I believed my aunt very &s;orry for his death, yet I thought &s;he had no great rea&s;on: for, I was &s;ure &s;he lived a very uncomfortable life with him. He want|ed then very much to know, what I was &s;o thoughtful about, if I was not troubled at the lo&s;s of my uncle. I declined telling him, but did it in a way that I intended &s;hould prompt his curio&s;ity; for I de&s;ired nothing more than to have a fair opportunity to tell him very plainly what troubled me; and he &s;oon gave it me. He told me, he took him&s;elf to be &s;o much intere&s;ted in me now, as to be concerned in all my griefs; and he claimed to know if any thing afflicted me, that he might bear his &s;hare in it; and added &s;omething &s;o hand&s;ome and &s;o obliging on that head, that I mu&s;t acknowledge it &s;hook my re&s;olution very much; and I had almo&s;t given over my de&s;ign; but I recovered my&s;elf again in a moment or two.</P>

<SPEAKER>3d &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him, it was natural for people to make &s;udden tran&s;itions from other people's ea&s;e to their own, and that indeed that was the occa&s;ion that made me &s;o un|ea&s;y. I knew my aunt was a lady of great piety and virtue that every one knew to be exceeding religious and &s;erious: That, on the other hand, Sir James was a mad, frolick&s;ome, merry fellow, that neither under&s;tood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y religion, or troubled him&s;elf about it, but would play a thou&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tricks with her, becau&s;e of her &s;trict ob|&s;ervation of religious things; and, that this gave her a con&s;tant unea&s;ine&s;s. He &s;miled, and &s;aid, He hoped I was not afraid of him on that &s;core; for, Madam, &s;ays he, though I pretend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> religion my&s;elf, I cannot but re&s;pect them that do. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was the fir&s;t, and I think a con&s;iderable confirmation what we had before; was it not &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<SPEAKER>3d &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay &s;i&s;ter; but we did not end here: I told him! was very &s;orry to hear him &s;ay he had no religion him&s;elf; becau&s;e, as perhaps I had not a great deal, to marry a man that had none, would endanger my lo&s;ing what I had, and I &s;hould rather have a hu&s;band to help me on towards heaven, than to pull me back.</P>

<P>He told me, he did not doubt but I would go to heaven without his help. He &s;aid, je&s;tingly, it was a road he had never travelled; but I might be a&s;&s;ured, he would not willingly pull me back, if he did not help me on.</P>

<P>I told him, what tricks my uncle u&s;ed to &s;erve my aunt; how he got a book of devotions out of her clo|&s;er once, and got a long printed &s;tory about ducking a &s;cold pa&s;ted into it; and another time got the ballad of <HI>Cheve Chace</HI> bound into her p&s;alm book; how, when he know &s;he was in her clo&s;et at her devotion, he would bring his ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">men to feed the hounds ju&s;t under her window; and how, one time, he made a fellow cry fire, and the like; as you know, &s;i&s;ter, he played many &s;uch pranks, and would do any thing to put her thoughts into di&s;or|der. He told me, though he was but a young fellow, and had not troubled his thoughts much about religion (there was another &s;tab to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;i&s;ter) yet he &s;aid he could not bear to make a je&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> neither.</P>

<P>I replied, I was very &s;orry to hear him own,
<PB N="38" REF="025384_0037_0FCCE1149416E220">
that he had not troubled his thoughts about religion, and a&s;ked him upon what foundation he could think of &s;etting up a family, if that was his ca&s;e? He told me he kept a chaplain, and je&s;tingly told me, he was devout enough for all the re&s;t of the hou&s;e. I grew chagrin'd and dull; I told him that the&s;e things had filled me with very &s;ad thoughts about marrying, and it looked very di&s;mal to me: but all I could &s;ay, could not bring him to believe I was in earne&s;t.</P>

<P>Well but pray go on with your &s;tory; what an&s;wer did he make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>He laughed at me, and told me he believed marrying would make him mighty religious; that he would chu&s;e a wife fir&s;t, and then chu&s;e his religion.</P>

<SPEAKER>1&s;t &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>The man was mad, &s;ure, to open him&s;elf &s;o fully.</P>

<SPEAKER>3d &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I appeared then really di&s;turbed, and whether he perceiv'd it or no, I am &s;ure the tears &s;tood in my eyes; however, I &s;truggled with my di&s;order, and told him I was very &s;orry then that it was his misfortune to begin with one, that could not be content to marry up|on the&s;e terms; and hoped, when he was fully &s;atisfied of the rea&s;on of &s;uch a re&s;olution in me, he would not take it ill, that I would &s;tay for him, till he re&s;olved more &s;e|riou&s;ly upon a thing of &s;o much importance.</P>

<SPEAKER>1&s;t &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>3d &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not fail to take it &s;o; and told him, the longer he was without me it might be the better for him; but the longer he was without religion, I was &s;ure would be wor&s;e for him; and that I wondered how a man of his &s;en&s;e could talk &s;o. He replied, he had rather talk

of any thing el&s;e; for he &s;ound this di&s;cour&s;e did not plea&s;e me. I told him he mi&s;took me very much; for, though I confe&s;&s;ed it did not plea&s;e me to find him to be what I hoped he was not, that is, a per&s;on who pretend|ed to no religion; yet it plea&s;ed me very well that he had been &s;o ju&s;t to him&s;elf, as to let me know it, before any engagements had pa&s;&s;ed between us.</P>

<SPEAKER>1&s;t &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>3d &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know it is all new to me; but, however, I knew the thing was for my life, and that I mu&s;t &s;peak now or never; and I was re&s;olved to put an end to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1&s;t &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t own you were in the right, though I am pur&s;uaded I could not have &s;aid half &s;o much.</P>

<P>He &s;aid, he wondered I could &s;ay that no en|gagements were between us. He &s;aid he was &s;o engag|ed to me, as he never could go back. I an&s;wered, that as his engagements were from him&s;elf, &s;o they were be&s;t known to him&s;elf; but that he knew very well I was un|der none to him. He &s;miled then, and &s;aid, he hoped I was. I an&s;wered, I had not profe&s;&s;ed to be engaged; I told him I would not deny, that I had re&s;pect enough for him to have gone farther, had not &s;uch difficulties ap|peared, as I could never get over, and had he been the per&s;on he was repre&s;ented; but that, as it was, I had too much re&s;pect for my&s;elf to ruin my&s;elf with my eyes open, and too much re&s;pect for him to keep him in &s;u&s;pence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1&s;t &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would he not take that for being in earne&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he &s;hewed me then that he took me to be in earne&s;t, and &s;hewed me, that he was in earne&s;t too; for he appeared warm, and a little angry. He told me, he was very &s;orry to be charged with deceiving me; and a&s;k|ed, if ever he had &s;aid any thing of him&s;elf which was not true? For, Madam, &s;ays he, if I am not the per|&s;on I appeared to be, I mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> deceived you in &s;ome|thing;
<PB N="40" REF="025384_0039_0FCCE117A337ABB8">
pray what &s;ort of a per&s;on did you take me for? I replied, as warm as he, that I wondered he &s;hould mi&s;|take me &s;o much; that I thought he did not do me ju&s;|tice; that I had &s;aid indeed he was not the per&s;on he had been repre&s;ented, but never &s;aid, that he had repre|&s;ented him&s;elf one way or other. Then he begged par|don again, and told me, he had taken me wrong; that, whatever came of it, he would never deceive me; I &s;hould know the wor&s;t of him, whether I would have him or no. Indeed, Sir, &s;aid I, I am per&s;uaded you are no hypocrite. I under&s;tand you, &s;aid he, you think I have u&s;ed more hone&s;ty than di&s;cretion. No, Sir, &s;aid I, I ve|ry much approve of your hone&s;ty, and do not blame your di&s;cretion at all. But I do, &s;aid he, for I find, if I could have counterfeited more &s;erious things than I am ma&s;ter of, and feigned my&s;elf a little religious, all had been well. I told him, I would not &s;ay that it was in his power to have deceived me; but I hoped he had acted a part much more like a gentleman. He replied, that it was hard then I &s;hould make &s;o unkind a return to him, as to make him lo&s;e his mi&s;tre&s;s for his hone&s;ty.</P>

<P>Why really, &s;i&s;ter, &s;o it was.</P>

<SPEAKER>3d &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him I thought the be&s;t return was to treat him with the &s;ame &s;incerity, and that was the rea|&s;on of the freedom I took; that, as he told me plainly what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was, I mu&s;t tell him plainly, I could not think of engaging with him any farther, till he had thought a little of things, which alone could make it rea&s;onable for him to think of marrying. He would fain have turned it off to a je&s;t, he laughed at me, he bantereth me, he a&s;ked me, how long I would &s;tay for him? I told him, I was in no ha&s;te. He a&s;ked me, how long I thought I might &s;tay, before I got a &s;aint to my mind, as the world went now? I told him, I was but an ill judge of &s;aints, and might be cheated, as wi&s;er than I had been; but that, as I told him before I would not fall into the pit with my eyes open. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me, abruptly, he wi&s;hed I had never &s;een him. At that word, I confe&s;s I was a little alarmed; however, I made no an&s;wer, but looked full in his face; I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he was concerned, and, as I thought, in a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> When he found I look|ed

at him, he repeated the words thus, I wi&s;h with all my heart you had never &s;een me. I an&s;wered nothing. He added, he wi&s;hed he had known my mind &s;ooner. I &s;till &s;aid nothing. Then he flung him&s;elf into my arms, and hung about me: my dear, &s;ays he, with an inex|pre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s, why are you &s;ilent? Becau&s;e, &s;ays I, I would not give you an an&s;wer in kind to any thing that is di&s;obliging. He returned, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;ay or do any thing di&s;obliging to me; that it was true, he wi&s;hed I had never &s;een him, and that he had known my mind &s;ooner; but it was, that he might have di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf better, and not to have lo&s;t me for be|ing &s;o fooli&s;hly hone&s;t. Why, &s;aid I, would you have endeavoured to have cheated me? Ay, certainly, &s;aid he, rather than loo&s;e you; and would have done it effec|tually too. Why, what would you have done? &s;aid I. Done! replied he, I would have been the &s;obere&s;t, grav|e&s;t young fellow that ever you &s;aw in your life. And, do you think your&s;elf hypocrite enough, &s;aid I, to have concealed your&s;elf effectually? Why not, &s;aid he, per|haps you think I am too much a fool for it. No, Sir, &s;aid I, I think you are too hone&s;t for it: and, of the two, it is much the better on your &s;ide.</P>

<SPEAKER>3d &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he carried it on thus a long time, till he put an odd ca&s;e to me, which made me put a &s;hort end to the di&s;cour&s;e: we were &s;peaking of fortunes, and the grandeur of families: at la&s;t we came to &s;peak of the young Duke of&mdash;. Why now, &s;ays he, if his Grace &s;hould come and court you with the &s;tate and grandeur of his quality, the title of a dutche&s;s, &amp;c. you would not turn &s;hort upon him, as you did upon me, and &s;ay, My Lord Duke, pray what religion are you of? and yet he has no more religion than I. I told him, I thought he did not treat me fairly: that it was &s;aying nothing at all, to &s;ay I would not have this man or that man, who never made any preten&s;ions to me; it was e|nough to me, that I would let him know, I would re|fu&s;e all the men in the world, that &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver come to me, unle&s;s I found a reverence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, a &s;en&s;e of reli|gion,

and a profe&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t of the duty we all owe to our Maker, had made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions on them: That I might be deceived indeed with an hypocrite, for it was not in me to judge of the heart, and as the world was now &s;tated, it was but too probable I &s;hould; but then it &s;hould be my mi&s;ery, not my fault: and that &s;ince he &s;eemed to in&s;inuate, that I did not act in that affair with &s;incerity, I had no better &s;pecimen of my re&s;olution than this, that though I was very &s;orry to treat him &s;o, who, I was &s;atisfied had a re&s;pect for me, and who&s;e re&s;pect I acknowledged was not di&s;agreeable, and who&s;e e&s;tate and propo&s;als were very much better than I had rea&s;on to ex|pect: yet that upon this one &s;ingle account I a&s;&s;ured him, I neither could nor would di&s;cour&s;e more with him on this affair; and hoped he would not take it ill, that I was forced to be &s;o plain with him, before I could per&s;uade him I was in earne&s;t; and having &s;aid all this, I offer|ed to ri&s;e and retire, but he held me fa&s;t in his arms, and would not let me &s;tir.</P>

<SPEAKER>3d &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look! I confe&s;s, &s;i&s;ter, his looks mov'd me more than all the words he could have &s;aid in half a year; and I &s;hall never forget them. He &s;eemed &s;trangely af|fected, and once or twice I &s;aw tears in his eyes; but he turned his head away, and recovered him&s;elf, and em|barked me in another di&s;cour&s;e, in &s;pite of all I had &s;aid. Hold, &s;ays he, you have broke one po&s;itive promi&s;e you made me already. I told him, I did not remember that I had ever made him any promi&s;e at all. Yes, &s;aid he, you told me that you would &s;tay for me, till I had made choice in matters of religion. I told him, I had not broke that promi&s;e yet. Yes, he &s;aid, I had, in &s;aying, I would never di&s;cour&s;e more with him on this affair. I replied, then, I would except that circum&s;tance, tho' I thought he need not in&s;i&s;t upon it for &s;everal rea&s;ons: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e he might find &s;o many ladies abroad, who would not trouble their heads to make the objection I dad done, and there was no occa&s;ion for him to turn re|ligious for a wife. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e there was no ap|pearance of his turning upon the&s;e terms. He &s;aid,
<PB N="43" REF="025384_0042_0FCCE11C71874A70">
that was more than I knew. But, pray, Madam, &s;aid he, why do you lay &s;uch a mighty &s;tre&s;s upon this parti|cular? Religion is an entire article by it&s;elf; my being relious, or not religious, need not ob&s;truct our affec|tion to one another; I am no enemy to religion. I an|&s;wered, that it was indeed an acceptable thing, as times went now, not to find a gentleman a de&s;pi&s;er, and hater of religion, and of all that favoured it; but that I was a&s;&s;ured, where there was not a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, and where God was not acknowledged, there could be no ble&s;&s;ing expected: and that I &s;hould think I had renoun|ced God, and declared war again&s;t heaven, if I &s;hould marry a man that openly acknowledged he had no reli|gion. He told me he was &s;orry to &s;ee me run things to &s;uch an extremity; that he did not think I had been in earne&s;t, when he, in je&s;t, &s;aid, he had not thought of re|ligion; that he would not urge me in a thing, which I laid &s;o much &s;tre&s;s upon, but would wait on me again, and hoped to find me in another mind, and to let me know he was not quite &s;o bad as I thought him to be. And thus we broke up.</P>

the young gentleman a little; for his &s;tory does not end &s;o. He went away very much concerned, as above, and particularly it touched him very &s;en&s;ibly, that he &s;hould be taken for &s;uch a creature, that a &s;ober, virtuous lady (for &s;uch he was &s;ure his mi&s;tre&s;s was) &s;hould refu&s;e him merely on account of his wicked character; and that tho' &s;he acknowledged &s;he had a re&s;pect for him, &s;he was obli|ged to &s;hun him, purely becau&s;e &s;he was afraid of him, as a hater of religion, and therefore dangerous to live with. It has often run in his mind, that &s;he had &s;aid, &s;he could expect no ble&s;&s;ing with him; and that if &s;he married him, &s;he &s;hould think &s;he had renounced God, and de|clared war again&s;t Heaven; &s;o that, to be &s;ure, I am a dreadful fellow, &s;ays he, that &s;he dares not take me, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould appear to be a confederate with one of God's enemies.</P>
<P>It then occurred to him, that it really was no other|wi&s;e in fact: that &s;he was in the right in it all; that he had in truth no religion, or &s;en&s;e of God, upon his mind, nor had ever entertained any notions of religion in his thoughts, and had told her &s;o him&s;elf, and that therefore the young lady was in the right of it, and if &s;he had any fund of religion her&s;elf, had a great deal of rea&s;on to refu&s;e him; that every &s;ober woman ought to refu&s;e him upon the &s;ame account: and that &s;he, that did not, was not fit to make him a wife, or at lea&s;t &s;uch a wife as he could expect any happine&s;s from; that this young lady had made a true judgment, and it was his bu&s;ine&s;s not to think of per&s;uading her to alter her mind, which, in &s;hort, mu&s;t le&s;&s;en his opinion of her, but to con&s;ider what &s;tate and condition he was in, and what was his fir&s;t bu&s;i|ne&s;s to do, to deliver him&s;elf out of it, before he went to her any more.</P>
<P>He gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w unea&s;y upon this &s;ubject for &s;ome time, and being perfectly ignorant of every thing called duty, ha|ving had an education wholly void of in&s;truction, that un|ea&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed; and not knowing which way to ca&s;t his thoughts for immediate direction, he grew very melan|choly and dejected: he loved this young woman to an extreme, and that affection was infinitely increa&s;ed by her conduct in this affair, and by the extraordinary manner
<PB N="45" REF="025384_0044_0FCCE11F13258CE0">
of her refu&s;ing him: but the reproaches of his heart, as being &s;uch a mon&s;ter, that a woman, that even owned &s;he loved him, dur&s;t not join her&s;elf to him, doubled upon him as his affections for her increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>He could not think of coming to her again; for he confe&s;&s;ed the rea&s;ons, which &s;he gave for her not daring to take him, were &s;o ju&s;t, and &s;he had argued them &s;o well, that if &s;he &s;hould abate any thing of them, he &s;hould not have &s;o much e&s;teem for her as he had before; and yet he &s;aw, that if &s;he did not, he could never expect to have her; and yet al&s;o he could not bear the thoughts of not having her, for all that.</P>
<P>He lived in this unea&s;y condition &s;ome months: his friends perceiving him to be very melancholy, tried many ways to divert him; but none reached his ca&s;e, or, if they did, they under&s;tood not how to advi&s;e him; for his re|lations were mo&s;t like him&s;elf, people of levity and gal|lantry, being rich and gay; a family that dealt very little in matters of religion. He had an aunt, his mother's &s;i&s;ter, who &s;eemed very much concerned about it; but as &s;he thought all that ailed him was his being cro&s;&s;ed in his affection, &s;he worked her thoughts about, night and day, to find out a wife for him. And &s;o to take his thoughts off, and turn them another way. At length, &s;he found out a young lady in the city, of a very great fortune; for &s;he had near 20,000l. to her portion, and &s;he plyed it &s;o warm|ly with him, that he con&s;ented to treat of it with her friends, and his circum&s;tances being &s;uch as few fortunes would refu&s;e, he found his way clear enough, and &s;o went to vi&s;it the young lady.</P>
<P>It was an odd kind of court&s;hip, you may be &s;ure, and he went about it accordingly; for, as he confe&s;&s;ed after|ward, he re&s;olved, before he &s;aw her, not to like her or any thing &s;he &s;aid or did; no, nor ever to be in earne&s;t with her upon any thing; but only to je&s;t with, and ban|ter her; and he told his aunt &s;o before-hand. However, his aunt would not take him at his word, but would have him wait upon her, and &s;o he did; but he needed not to have taken up any re&s;olutions in the ca&s;e, for he was &s;poil|ed for court&s;hip already, at lea&s;t, for mo&s;t of the ladies of the times; he had no reli&s;h for any of their conver&s;ation;
<PB N="46" REF="025384_0045_0FCCE122FAA7A7D0">
it was like mu&s;ic to one that had no ear: all the gaiety and flutter about them was lo&s;t upon him; his fir&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s had treated him with &s;uch &s;olid rea&s;oning, &s;uch &s;erious talk, and had handled him after &s;uch a manner, that in &s;hort nothing but what was &s;erious had now any reli&s;h with him; however, as I have &s;aid, he re&s;olved to put a force upon him&s;elf &s;o far, as to go and &s;ee what kind of thing his new mi&s;tre&s;s was; and accordingly he did go, as above.</P>
<P>But when he had been one evening there, and had talk|ed a little with her, he &s;oon &s;aw he had no need of mak|ing re&s;olutions; that he was in no danger of being in|&s;nared by her; the levity of her behaviour, the emptine&s;s of her di&s;cour&s;e, the weakne&s;s of her conduct, made him &s;ick of her the very fir&s;t time; and when he came away, he &s;aid to him&s;elf, It is po&s;&s;ible for any man in his &s;en&s;es to bear this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cock, that had been but one half hour with my other mi&s;tre&s;s! And away he came, not plea&s;ed at all. However, he went again for &s;ome time, till at la&s;t, not finding things mend, but rather grow wor&s;e, he was re&s;olved he would talk a little with her about religion; and, as he a&s;ked her one night, What religion &s;he was of? &s;he an&s;wered him ju&s;t in the very words that he had ban|tered his other mi&s;tre&s;s, O, &s;ays &s;he, I am a mighty good Chri&s;tian. I believe &s;o, thought he; ju&s;t &s;uch another as I was when I was a&s;ked the &s;ame que&s;tion. However, he concealed his thoughts, re&s;olved to carry it on a little farther, and gave her a mighty civil an&s;wer; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> don't doubt that, Madam, &s;ays he. Well, &s;ays &s;he, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, what would you have more? Nay, nothing, Madam return|ed he, I was only in je&s;t. O, &s;ays &s;he, you want to know what opinion I am of? You &s;ee I am no Quaker.

He had enough of that di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;o he turned it off to &s;ome|thing el&s;e; for, though it was almo&s;t the pattern of what he had done with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fir&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s, yet it looked with &s;uch a different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to him now, that, as he &s;aid afterwards, it made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> very blood run cold within him, and filled

him with horror at his own picture, which, he thought, now was &s;et before his eyes in all its ju&s;t deformities. When he came away from her, he &s;aid to him&s;elf, Well, now I &s;ee the true force of what that dear creature argu|ed for her&s;elf again&s;t me; that to venture upon me while I declared again&s;t religion, was to run her&s;elf into the pit with her eyes open, and ruin her&s;elf by mere preme|ditated choice. It would be ju&s;t &s;o with me in this ca&s;e, if I &s;hould marry this butterfly; we &s;hould even go hand in hand very lovingly to the devil. This will not do my bu&s;ine&s;s! So he put an end to that affair as &s;oon as he could, and re&s;olved to &s;ee her no more</P>
<P>All this while he had no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from either books, friends, mini&s;ters, or any body, only the ju&s;t and natural reflections of his own rea&s;on: but, as he was a gentleman of polite manners, and bred to conver&s;ation with gentle|men of the be&s;t quality, as well as of the be&s;t parts, &s;o the government of him&s;elf was the more ea&s;y, and he re&s;trained the dejection of his &s;pirits from making any extraordinary di&s;covery of it&s;elf, only, that he appeared a little more &s;edate and more thoughtful than before, and was a little more retired in his way of living; but not &s;o much but that he came often into public company, as be|fore.</P>
<P>It happened one time, that, in promi&s;cuous conver&s;a|tion, at a chocolate-hou&s;e near the court, this gentleman and &s;even or eight more being pre&s;ent, the company fell from talking of news to talking of religion: the di&s;cour&s;e began about the differences which had happened in France lately, and were then depending, between the Pope and the French clergy; and of the Sorbonne, or faculty of theology, as they are called there, being at that time em|ployed in drawing up a new &s;y&s;tem of divinity, or body of doctrine as they called it; and as a con&s;equence it was hinted, how likely it was, that &s;uch a &s;trict inquiry, made by men of learning and virtue, into the fundamentals of religion, &s;hould lead them at la&s;t into Prote&s;tant princi|ples, and break that whole kingdom off from the errors and ignorance of Popery, opening the eyes of the people to Chri&s;tian knowledge. There being &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;en&s;ible gentlemen there, the di&s;cour&s;e was carried on ve|ry

gravely and judiciou&s;ly, and the whole company &s;eem|ed to receive it with plea&s;ure; when a couple of young beaux, who happened to be in the room, beginning to be tired with a thing &s;o much out of their way, one of them ri&s;es up on a &s;udden, and &s;ays to the other, Come, Jack, I am tired of this dull religious &s;tuff; prithee let us go, there's nothing in it. Ay, &s;ays the other, with all my heart, I know nothing of the matter: come, will you go to the opera?

Why, &s;ays the other, how long have you been in orders, pray? Is &s;uch &s;tuff as that fit conver&s;ation for a gentleman? Yes, &s;ays the &s;ober young gentleman, I think it is: pray, what can there be in religious conver&s;ation that is unfit for a gentleman? There &s;at an antient nobleman by, talking with a clergy|man, who hearing the young gentleman's reply, fell a laughing; for this di&s;cour&s;e put the former &s;ubject to a &s;top. On my word, Gentlemen, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, Mr.&mdash;has met with you: I don't think you can an&s;wer his que&s;tion. Yes, my Lord, &s;ays the fooli&s;h beau, I think it is below a man of quality to trouble his head a|bout it. Pray, Sir, &s;ays the Lord, is it below a man of quality to be a Chri&s;tian? O, my Lord, &s;ays the other beau, bantering and je&s;ting, we are mighty good Chri&s;t|ians at the opera; and turning away to his comrades, &s;ays he, Come, come, Jack, prithee let us go: &s;o they went both out together, for they did not care to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ngage. Our gentleman li&s;tened with plea&s;ure to all this di&s;cour&s;e, till he heard the&s;e words, <HI>mighty good Chri&s;tians:</HI> and then reflected upon his having u&s;ed that expre&s;&s;ion to his mi&s;|tre&s;s, and how his la&s;t lady gave him the &s;ame return; but he thought it was &s;o empty, &s;o ab&s;urd a turn to a thing of that con&s;equence, that he reproached him&s;elf with having talked &s;o fooli&s;hly, and was a&s;hamed to think, how like one of the&s;e &s;ops he had appeared to her; and how he had talked after the &s;ame &s;en&s;ele&s;s way, which he now looked upon to be the mo&s;t empty, &s;candalous thing in the world.</P>

<P>Our gentleman came home charmed with this di&s;|cour&s;e, as indeed the whole company were be&s;ides; e&s;pe|cially con&s;idering the authority and dignity of the per|&s;on who &s;poke it. His mind was in&s;pired with new thoughts by it, both of religion and of him&s;elf; he not only &s;aw more of the excellency of religion in it&s;elf, but began clearly to &s;ee it was the ornament of a gentleman to be a Chri&s;tian. It was with the greate&s;t contempt, that he now looked back upon the notion he had former|ly e&s;pou&s;ed of a gentleman's being above troubling him|&s;elf with &s;erious things. How &s;ordid and bruti&s;h did the two beaux appear, &s;aid he, compared to that noble and excellent per&s;on, my Lord&mdash;! How were they laughed at and de&s;pi&s;ed by all the gentlemen in the com|pany, and looked upon as fellows fit for nothing, but in the highway to di&s;a&s;ter! On the other hand, it occur|red to him, how hand&s;omely did that young gentleman an&s;wer them! with what mode&s;ty did he &s;peak, and yet boldly, in defence of a religious life? and what an honour was paid him for it by all the company, and by the noble|man in particular? and then to think o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> what the Lord had &s;aid, with what applau&s;e it was received; how all the company li&s;tened to his Lord&s;hip, as to an oracle; how general a con&s;ent was given to it by all the gentle|men; and, in a word, how agreeable the conver&s;ation of the day was, put it all together; and yet, &s;aid he, of eleven gentlemen in the room, there was not one man among them, except the clergyman, who was not above me both in quality and e&s;tate.</P>
<P>From all this he drew this general and happy conclu|&s;ion for him&s;elf, viz. That he &s;hould never be a com|plete gentleman, till he became a religious man; and that the more of a Chri&s;tian he was, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould be for the conver&s;ation of the be&s;t and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> in the

<P>To avoid the u&s;ual diver&s;ions of the town, while the&s;e &s;erious thoughts were upon him, he re&s;olved to retire into the country, to a little &s;eat he had in Hamp&s;hire, remote from all conver&s;ation, and where he had no body to talk to, but his own &s;ervants, or &s;ome of the neighbour|hood, who were all his tenants. When he &s;ound him&s;elf &s;o perfectly alone, it began be a little too much for him, and he grew very heavy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a little hypochondriac: his mind was oppre&s;&s;ed with the thoughts of his cir|cum&s;tances, but dark as to the due inquiries he ought to have made; at length he rou&s;ed him&s;elf a little with the&s;e thoughts.</P>
<P>I talk of being religious! and being a Chri&s;tian! why, I under&s;tand nothing of it, or how to go about it. What is it? what is religion? and what is it to be a Chri&s;tian? He po&s;ed him&s;elf with the&s;e que&s;tions, and knew not what an&s;wer to give him&s;elf, when it came thus into his mind, Did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t that dear fir&s;t preacher (meaning the young lady he had courted) tell me what religion was, and how &s;he under&s;tood it, viz.

<P>He was &s;eriou&s;ly mu&s;ing on this part one evening walk|ing all alone in a field near his hou&s;e, when he began to look with great concern, upon the want, which he felt, of an early foundation laid in his mind by a religious education.

In his way he nece&s;&s;arily went by a poor labouring man's door, who, with a wife and four chil|dren, lived in a &s;mall cottage on the wa&s;te, where he (the gentleman) was lord of the manor. As he pa&s;&s;ed by he thought he heard the man's voice; and &s;tepping up clo&s;e to the door, he perceived that the poor good old man was praying to God with his family. As he &s;aid after|wards, his heart &s;prung in his brea&s;t for joy at the occa|&s;ion, and he li&s;tened eagerly to hear what he &s;aid.

<P>He was confounded, and &s;truck as it were &s;peechle&s;s, with &s;urpri&s;e at what he had heard. Nothing could be more affecting to him: he came away (for he had &s;taid as long as his heart could hold) and walked to &s;ome di&s;|tance, and there he &s;topped, looked up, and round him, as he &s;aid, to &s;ee if he was awake, or if it was a dream. At la&s;t he got &s;ome vent to his thought, and throwing out his arms, Merciful God! &s;ays he, is this to be a Chri&s;tian! What then have I been all my days? What is this man thus thankful for? Why, my dogs live bet|ter than he does, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;pects, and he is on his knees adoring Infinite Goodne&s;s for his enjoyments? Why, I have enjoyed all I have, and never had the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of God's goodne&s;s to me, or ever once &s;aid, God, I thank thee for it, in my life. Well might a &s;ober woman be afraid of me. Is this humble temper, this thankfulne&s;s for mere poverty! is this the effect of being a Chri&s;tian? Why, then, Chri&s;tians are the happie&s;t people in the world! Why, I &s;hould hang my&s;elf, if I was to be reduced to a degree a hundred times above him; and yet, here is peace, ea&s;e of mind, &s;atisfaction in circum&s;tances, nay thankfulne&s;s, which is the exce&s;s of human felicity; and all this in a man who ju&s;t lives one degree above &s;tarv|ing. We think our farmers poor &s;laves, who labour and drudge in the earth to &s;upport us that are their landlords, and who look upon us like their lords and ma&s;ters; why, this poor wretch is but a drudge to the&s;e drudges, a &s;lave of &s;laves; and yet he gives God thanks for the happine&s;s of his condition!

<P>Indeed, Sir, if in this world only we had hope,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, William: but there is a great deal required in prayer, that I am an utter &s;tranger to: I never pray|ed in my life; no, nor I believe my father or grandfa|ther before me, William! I came of a cur&s;ed race, Wil|liam, and I doubt it is entailed upon the family, like the e&s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, do not &s;ay that: the &s;cripture is plain, an't plea&s;e you, that the children &s;hall not be puni&s;hed for the father's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>That's true, indeed, Sir, they mu&s;t not tread in tho&s;e &s;teps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do&s;t thou talk then of prayer being the fir&s;t duty? Why, if that be the fir&s;t thing, I mu&s;t not begin; for, how can &s;uch a creature as I pray to God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the Spirit of God will a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e, who&s;e hearts are towards him, &s;o we mu&s;t pray, that we may be taught to pray.</P>

<P>Is it not a difficult thing for a man to pray to God, William, that &s;carce ever thought of God in all his life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, but who do you think put tho&s;e thoughts in your mind, which now you have? and who opened your eyes, Sir, to &s;ee a beauty in religion, as now you &s;ee; and touched your heart with &s;uch an earne&s;t de|&s;ire after the ways and things of God, as you now expre&s;s|ly &s;ay you have? do you think this is not of God, an't plea&s;e you?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, William, I know not; it would be a ve|ry delightful thing to me, if I thought it was &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without que&s;tion, Sir, it is: man can have no &s;uch power; nature prompts us to evil thoughts and evil de&s;ires, and to them only; the imagination of the thoughts of our hearts are evil, and only evil; if there are any good motions, or heavenly de&s;ires in the heart, they are from God. Every good gift, and every perfect gift comes down from above; it is his power works them, his invi|&s;ible grace forms all holy de&s;ires in the &s;oul.</P>

<P>Why, Sir, an't plea&s;e you, if God has begun a good work, he will perfect it: if he has turned your face towards him, he will lift up your heart to him: to pray to God is as natural to a convert, as to cry after the fa|ther or mother is to an infant.</P>

<P>Thank your wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>[They were now come to the manor-hou&s;e, and he was loth to detain him, becau&s;e it was late, and becau&s;e they were &s;o affected with the di&s;cour&s;e they had had, that he wanted very much to be alone.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he came into his own hou&s;e, he locked him|&s;elf into a parlour, and began to con&s;ider, with great &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s, all the&s;e things, and e&s;pecially what the poor man had &s;aid to him about praying to God; and, as his thoughts were intent upon the meaning of prayer, the na|ture of it, and the advantages of it, at every turn of the&s;e thoughts he found a &s;ecret kind of hint like a voice in him, O that I could pray! O, if I could pray but as the poor man does! How happy &s;hould I be, if I could but pray to God! and the like. He was not aware of the&s;e move|ments; they &s;eemed to be wrought in his affections per|fectly involuntarily and &s;udden; and they pa&s;&s;ed over with|out being noticed or ob&s;erved, even by him&s;elf, till after a good while they returned &s;tronger and more frequent up|on him; &s;o that he not only perceived it, but remember|ed how often his heart had thrown out the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions; when, on a &s;udden, the poor man's words came into his mind with &s;uch a force, as if the man him&s;elf had been there; why this was praying; certainly I have been pray|ing all this while, and knew it not.</P>
<P>Upon this reflection, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to ex|pre&s;s, as he &s;aid afterwards, what a &s;trange rapture of joy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind, and how his heart was turned within him; then he fell into the &s;ame &s;acred ejaculations of a|nother kind, viz. of admiration, prai&s;es, thank&s;giving, and mere a&s;toni&s;hment; but &s;till without &s;peaking other|wi&s;e
<PB N="67" REF="025384_0066_0FCCE72555F33F58">
than a kind of mental voice, &s;ounding or injecting words into his mind: &s;uch as the&s;e, Lord! &s;hall I be brought to pray to God! I that have never been told &s;o much as how to mention his name! I that have never known any thing of God, or my&s;elf! or have been taught any thing of my duty to him! &s;hall I be taught to pray! and taught by whom! by this poor de&s;picable creature, that at another time I would not have &s;poken to, if he had made me twenty bows and &s;crapes! His tongue then was let loo&s;e; and he cried out, Ble&s;&s;ed be God that ever I came near that poor man.</P>
<P>He continued all that evening filled with comforting reflections, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h a kind of inward peace and &s;atisfac|tion; which as he had never known before, &s;o be knew not how to de&s;cribe or relate it, or indeed how to manage it. In the morning he &s;ound the &s;ame meditation and the &s;ame lightne&s;s upon his &s;pirits returned, and he remembered what the poor man had prayed for, for him, viz. That he might be comforted with the hopes of the pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing of God, to which his heart had &s;o readily &s;aid Amen. And now he longed for the poor man's coming with the Bible.</P>
<P>The poor man was likewi&s;e mightily affected with his ca&s;e, con&s;idering him a young gentleman of &s;uch a fami|ly and fortune; and who was &s;o far above him as that, though he was his landlord, he dur&s;t never offer to &s;peak to him in his life, but with the greate&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and di&s;tance; how he &s;hould come to call him out, and to talk to him, of &s;uch things e&s;pecially, and in &s;o &s;erious a manner.</P>
<P>He then reflected, with a &s;erious joy, that this young gentleman &s;hould be thus touched with a &s;olid &s;en&s;e of religion and good things; for it was ea&s;y to &s;ee, that it was not a &s;light or an in&s;incere work upon his mind.&mdash;It rejoiced his heart, that the heir of the e&s;tate &s;hould be thus likely to prove a good man; and it pre&s;ently oc|curred to his thoughts, how great a ble&s;&s;ing &s;uch a gen|tleman might be to the country, to the poor, and to the unin&s;tructed people round him; as well by reforming their manners, and re&s;training their vices, as, perhaps, by
<PB N="68" REF="025384_0067_0FCCE726EC3BAB60">
bringing religion to be accepted and received among them by his example.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of the thoughts he came along with, and as he walked, he prayed to God, very earne&s;tly, that he might be made an in&s;trument to bring the &s;oul of this gentleman to the knowledge of God, and to bow at the foot&s;tool of his Redeemer as a true penitent.</P>
<P>His prayers were not in vain. Prayer, put up from &s;uch a principle, and with &s;uch a &s;pirit, &s;eldom is made in vain.</P>
<P>He came to the gentleman, while he was in his bed; for he had given orders to his &s;ervants to bring him up to his chamber; there he delivered him the Bible, and told him he hoped he would find in it both encouragement and direction in the great work which he was going about, and that God would ble&s;s it to him, and would &s;upply by his grace all the wants of early in&s;truction, which he had &s;o much complained of,</P>
<P>He received the poor man with a glad heart, made him &s;it down by him, and told him, God had made him the in&s;trument of &s;o much good to him, that he could not part with him any more while he &s;tayed in the coun|try.</P>
<P>William, &s;ays he, God has made you a father to me, and I'll be a father to you and your family; you &s;hall go no more home to that poor cottage, you &s;hall have &s;ome|thing el&s;e to be thankful to God for than bread and wa|ter.</P>

<P>Well, William, you &s;hall be my mini&s;ter; come, &s;it down by me and read in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! I am a &s;orry creature to be a teacher, Sir; but an't plea&s;e you, I have turned down &s;ome pla|ces, which I thought of, to &s;hew your wor&s;hip for your fir&s;t reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's what I wanted, William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>An't plea&s;e you, here's a text which tells you what is the whole de&s;ign of a written go&s;pel; for what end the life of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer was laid down, and his works and doctrine were publi&s;hed to the world; and this &s;eems to be the fir&s;t thing we &s;hould know of the &s;criptures, for, indeed, it is the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Let me &s;ee it, William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here it is, Sir, <HI>The&s;e things are written, that ye might believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, the Son of God, and that believing, ye might have life through his name,</HI> John xx. 31.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very comprehen&s;ive indeed, William.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And here is another pa&s;&s;age I folded down, le&s;t you &s;hould a&s;k, how &s;hould you do to believe; it is in Mark ix. 24. it is a &s;tory of a man, who brings his child to our Lord to be healed, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an evil &s;pi|rit: our Lords a&s;ks him, if he could believe? <HI>If thou can&s;t believe, all things are po&s;&s;ible to him that believeth;</HI> and v. 24. <HI>The father cried; out with tears, Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.</HI></P>
<P>[William looks full in his face, while he repeated the words.]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you look at me for, William?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir! I &s;aw your very heart; I know you prayed; I know you &s;aid amen in your very &s;oul to that word; glory be to the grace of God, and to the word of God for you; the &s;cripture, read with &s;uch a heart as yours now is, will &s;oon teach you all that you want to know, and all that you want to do.</P>
<P>[The poor gentleman was overcome with his words, and could not &s;peak for a good while; tears came out of his

eyes; and at la&s;t he bur&s;ts out thus: Lord! what a crea|ture have I been, that have lived without the teachings of the &s;cripture all my days!</P>
<P>Thus far this happy poor man was made an in&s;trument to the re&s;toring this gentleman, and bringing him to the knowledge of God, and to a &s;en&s;e of religion; and in a word, to be a mo&s;t &s;incere Chri&s;tian. We &s;hall hear farther of him, after the next dialogue.]</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE III.</HEAD>
<P>WE mu&s;t now go back to the family which we be|gan with: the father of the young ladies was gone into the country to vi&s;it his &s;i&s;ter, who was newly become a widow; little thinking, whatever his elde&s;t daughter had &s;aid to him, that his younge&s;t daughter would make &s;uch &s;hort work with her lover in his ab|&s;ence, and that &s;he would quite put an end to the court|&s;hip all at one blow, as &s;he had done, before he came home again.</P>
<P>He &s;pent &s;ome little time at his &s;i&s;ter's to comfort her, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her in her affairs after the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band; and particularly, becau&s;e her elde&s;t &s;on, being of age and ju&s;t upon marrying, &s;he intended to remove; the hou&s;e, which was the &s;eat of the family, being to be fitted up for her new daughter-in-law: Upon the&s;e circum&s;tances, he began the following di&s;cour&s;e with his &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never &s;aw the like of you, &s;i&s;ter, you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a complaining; you have had one of the be&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, goode&s;t-conditioned, merrie&s;t fellows in the world for the&s;e five and twenty years, and yet you call your&s;elf a mi&s;erable woman: what would you a&s;k in a hu&s;band, that you had not in Sir James?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear brother, is this a time for me to tell you what I wanted in Sir James, when he is in his grave? I have wanted nothing in him that a woman could de&s;ire in a hu&s;band; he was rich in his e&s;tate, a lovely, com|plete, hand&s;ome gentleman in his per&s;on, and held it to the la&s;t; he was the be&s;t humoured man that ever woman had, and kind, as a hu&s;band, to the la&s;t degree: I never &s;aw him in a pa&s;&s;ion in my life; he was a man of good &s;en&s;e and good learning; a man of honour, good breeding, and good manners; none went beyond him; all the country knows it, and lov'd him for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! and yet my &s;i&s;ter a mi&s;erable wo|man! Would not any man laugh at you? I think, &s;i&s;ter, if ever you were a mi&s;erable woman, it is now, becau&s;e you have lo&s;t him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that's true too; I am &s;o now, many ways, and &s;ome, perhaps, that you do not think of, bro|ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you mean again; I warrant you have been whining over him, to think what is become of him now: prithee what's that to you or me! What can you, by your concern for him, do in that ca&s;e, one way or o|ther? can't you leave him to God's mercy, now he's gone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear brother, it is in vain to an&s;wer you; I mu&s;t leave him to God's mercy, and &s;o we mu&s;t leave our|&s;elves; but do you think, it is not an afflicting, dread|ful thing to me, that knows how he lived, and how he died, to reflect upon his condition, if I had any love f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, how did he live? He lived like a gentle|man, as he was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; and that, as times go, brother, is to live like a heathen; you know well enough what a life, I have had with him on that only account; you know, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was &s;o far from having any &s;en&s;e of religion, or of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know he did not trouble him&s;elf much about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, he not only did not him&s;elf, but he did not really love to have any body about him religious. I have known many gentlemen that have had no religion them|&s;elves, yet value it in others, and value and reverence good men: but he thought all people hypocrites that talk|ed of any thing religious, and could not abide to &s;ee any appearance of it in the hou&s;e. It was the only thing we had any difference about all our days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I think you were a great fool to have any difference with him about that. Could not you have kept your religion to your&s;elf, and have let him alone, to be as frolick&s;ome as he would without it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I was obliged to do that, you may be &s;ure; you know it well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I know he &s;erved you many a merry prank about your religious doings&punc; &s;uch as, putting every now and then a ballad in your prayer-book, or p&s;alm-book; and I think he put the &s;tory of Tom Thumb once in one of Dr. Tillot&s;on's &s;ermons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: it was two leaves out of Don Quixote. He did a great many &s;uch things as tho&s;e to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they were all frolicks; there was nothing of pa&s;&s;ion or ill-nature in them. Did not he write &s;ome|thing in the children's &s;pelling-book once, and make them get it without book, in&s;tead of the le&s;&s;on you had &s;et them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, he played me a thou&s;and tricks that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think once he pa&s;ted a receipt to make a tanzy or a cake ju&s;t next to one of the que&s;tions of the catechi&s;m, where your daughter's le&s;&s;on was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay; and every now and then he would pa&s;te a &s;ingle printed word, that he cut out of &s;ome other book, ju&s;t over another word in their books, &s;o cunning|ly, that they could not perceive it, and make them read <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;en&s;e.</P>

<P>Why, what harm is there in all that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="74" REF="025384_0073_0FCCE72FAB4BDCC0">
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it &s;hewed his general contempt of good things, and making a mock of them, otherwi&s;e the thing was not of &s;o much value.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and wherein was you mi&s;erable, pray, in all this? I don't under&s;tand you in that at all</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, in this, that he was not at all a religious man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what was that to you, &s;till?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, fir&s;t, brother, there was all family religion lo&s;t at one blow. There could not be &s;o much as the ap|pearance of wor&s;hipping or acknowledging the God that made us; nay, we &s;carce a&s;ked him leave to eat our meat, but in &s;ecret, as if we were a&s;hamed of it. Sir James never &s;o much as &s;aid grace, or gave thanks at table in his life, that I remember.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they that do, make it nothing but a cere|mony, and do it for fa&s;hion-&s;ake, not that they think it &s;ignifies any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let them do it for fa&s;hion-&s;ake then, if they will, but let them do it. It is the mo&s;t rational thing in the world, while we own that God gives us our meat, that we &s;hould a&s;k him leave to eat it, and thank him for it when we have done. But, alas! this is but a &s;mall part of the ill con&s;equences of an irreligious family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what more is there? for this is nothing but what is in thou&s;ands of families, who pretend to reli|gion on all &s;ides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, all relative religion was lo&s;t too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Relative religion! Si&s;ter, what do you mean by that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, 1&s;t I mean by it that religion that ought to be between a man and his wife; &s;uch as comforting, encouraging, and directing one another, helping one an|other on in the way to heaven; a&s;&s;i&s;ting one another in Chri&s;tian duties, praying with and for one another, and much more which I could name, and which, without doubt, pa&s;&s;es to their mutual comfort and delight, be|tween a man and his wife, where they are mutually a|greed in wor&s;hipping and &s;erving God, and walking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the happy cour&s;e of a religious life. All this has been lo&s;t; and it has been a &s;ad lo&s;s to me, brother; we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="75" REF="025384_0074_0FCCE7313A870458">
all need of helps: and it is not every one that con&s;iders, or indeed that knows, what help, what comfort, what &s;upport, a religious hu&s;band or wife are or may be to one another. This, I &s;ay, has been a &s;ad lo&s;s to me, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are nice things; but, methinks, if you could not have tho&s;e helps from your hu&s;band, you might find them in other things, &s;uch as books, mini&s;ters, &amp;c. it need not be called &s;uch a lo&s;s neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;uch a lo&s;s, brother, that if I were to live my days over again, I would not marry a man that made no profe&s;&s;ion of religion; not I, though he had ten thou|&s;and pounds a year, and I had but a hundred pounds to my portion; nay, I think I would work for my bread rather.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You lay a mighty &s;tre&s;s upon the&s;e things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every body, brother, that has any &s;en&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ing of a religious family mu&s;t do &s;o. Pray, if the honouring and &s;erving of God be our wi&s;dom, our duty, our felicity, in this world, and our way to the next, what comfort, what happine&s;s can there be, where the&s;e are wanting in the head of a family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is better, to be &s;ure, where they may be had, but to lay all the happine&s;s of life upon it, as if a man or a woman could not be religious by them&s;elves, without they were &s;o both together, I do not &s;ee that; I think you carry it too far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll convince you that I do not carry it too far at all; I do not &s;ay a man or a woman may not be religious by them&s;elves, tho' the hu&s;band or wife be not &s;o; but I &s;ay, all the help and comfort of relative religion is lo&s;t; the benefit and value of which none knows, but they that enjoy it, or feel the want of it; but there is another lo&s;s which I have not named, and which my heart bleeds in the &s;en&s;e of every day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that, I wonder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, children! brother, children; you &s;ee I have five children; what dreadful work has this want of fami|ly-religion made among my poor children!</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, Sir James did not hinder you in&s;tructing your children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="76" REF="025384_0075_0FCCE73493442CB8">
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he not! it is true he did not when they were little; but has he not by example, and want of re&s;traint, encouraged all manner of levity, vanity, folly, nay, and even vice it&s;elf in them? Do you think children, thus let loo&s;e to humour their own inclinations, and to the full &s;wing of their plea&s;ures, would not &s;oon &s;natch them&s;elves out of the arms of their mother, and deliver them&s;elves from the importunities of one that had no other authority with them than that of affection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, there is &s;omething in that; but I do not &s;ee that your children are much the wor&s;e; there is your elde&s;t &s;on, Sir James that is now; he is a pretty young gentleman: I hear a very good character of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, brother, as times go now with gen|tlemen, we may be thankful neither he nor his brother are debauched or vicious; and I am thankful for it. They have good characters for mode&s;t pretty gentlemen, as you &s;ay: but &s;till, brother, the main thing is wanting. I cannot be partial to them, though they are my own; there is not the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e or notion of religion in them; they cannot &s;ay they have no knowledge of it. I took care to deprive them of that excu&s;e, as early as they knew any thing: but it goes no farther; my elde&s;t &s;on will tell me &s;ometimes, he has as much religion as a gentleman of a thou&s;and a-year &s;hould have; and his bro|ther tells me, if I would have had him have any religion, I &s;hould have kept our pari&s;h living for him, and bred him a par&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are very merry with you then I find upon that &s;ubject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a dreadful je&s;t to me brother; I am far from taking it merrily; you know I was otherwi&s;e brought up; our father and mother were of another &s;ort of people; they united their very &s;ouls in the work of God; they joined in every good thing with the utmo&s;t affection; they loved the &s;ouls as well as the bodies of us their children. The family was a hou&s;e of chearful devotion; God was &s;erved night and day; and, in a word, as they lived, &s;o they died; they dropped comfortably off, and went, as it were, hand in hand to heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, &s;i&s;ter, you &s;ee, we that were their chil|dren
<PB N="77" REF="025384_0076_0FCCE7359E7EFDD8">
were not all alike. There is our brother Jack, and our &s;i&s;ters Betty and Sarah, what can be &s;aid about them? Pray what religion are they of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you what can be &s;aid, and what will &s;tick clo&s;e to them one time or other, viz. if they are lo&s;t, it is not for want of good in&s;truction, or good example; they cannot blame father or mother; it has been all their own. Parents may beg grace for their children; but they can|not give it them; they may teach their children good things, but they cannot make them learn; that is the work of God, and parents mu&s;t &s;ubmit it to him. But, when parents do nothing, nay, rather by example and encouragement, lead their children into wickedne&s;s, what a dreadful thing is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but our two &s;i&s;ters were not led into wick|edne&s;s; and yet, as I &s;aid, they value religion as little as any body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay brother, I can tell you how my &s;i&s;ters were both ruined; for they were not &s;o educated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by ruined? they are not ruin|ed, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean as to their principles, brother, which I think is the wor&s;t &s;ort of ruin; they were ruined by mar|rying profligate, irreligious hu&s;bands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what you mean by profligate; I think they were both very well married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, as you call well married, and that I call be|ing undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray what has ruined Jack? for he is as gracele&s;s a wretch almo&s;t as your Sir James was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, brother, ju&s;t the other extreme: he has a wild, giddy, play hou&s;e-bred wife; full of wit, and void of grace, that never had any religion, nor knew what the meaning of it was; this has ruined him. My brother was a &s;ober, well-taught, well-inclined young man, as could be de&s;ired; but getting &s;uch a tempter at his elbow, in&s;tead of a wife to help him on to heaven, &s;he has led him hood-winked to the gates of hell, and goes chearfully along with him; a &s;ad in&s;tance, brother, of the want of family-religion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what's all this to what we are upon
<PB N="78" REF="025384_0077_0FCCE7371F1F1250">
of parents leading their children into wickedne&s;s? he was not led by his parents.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; but even that does not le&s;&s;en the grief, of &s;eeing my children lo&s;t and ruined before my face, and their own father to be the in&s;trument to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>They cannot be &s;aid to be ruined; they are very fine gentlemen, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>

<P>They are ruined as to the be&s;t qualification of a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant you they don't think &s;o, &s;i&s;ter: reli|gion makes us good Chri&s;tians, that is confe&s;&s;ed; but I do not &s;ee it makes a gentleman. What is more frequent, than to &s;ee religion make men cynical and four in their tempers, moro&s;e and &s;urly in their conver&s;ation? They think them&s;elves above the practice of good manners or good humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>This is all by the mi&s;take of the thing: it is want of religion that makes men thus. It is in good breeding as it is in philo&s;ophy; a little philo&s;ophy, a little learning, makes a man an Athei&s;t; a great deal brings him back, and makes him a Chri&s;tian: &s;o, a little religion makes a man a churl; but, a great deal, teaches him to know him&s;elf, and be a gentleman. When good principles join with good manners. how &s;hould they but illu&s;trate the education, and &s;et off the breeding of a man of qua|lity? As it is a mi&s;take to &s;ay, that jewels &s;hould be worn by none but homely women, it is ju&s;t the contrary; &s;o, religion adorns education, as jewels give real beauty a double lu&s;tre.</P>

<P>Let the &s;cripture be judge, whether the rules of life, dictated by the apo&s;tles to the Chri&s;tian churches, were not &s;uch, as not only agree well with that of a gen|tleman, but indeed with that, without which no man can be a gentleman; if you look almo&s;t through all the epi&s;tles in the New Te&s;tament, you will find it &s;o; I'll name you a few.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you are wrapt up in the&s;e notions, &s;i&s;ter: I fancy you have been documenting my daughter; I am afraid of it, I a&s;&s;ure you; &s;he has ju&s;t got the &s;ame things in her noddle, and &s;he has carried her &s;cruples to &s;uch a length, that &s;he had like to have refu&s;ed the be&s;t match that ever will be offered to her as long as &s;he lives; but I believe I rattled her out of it, when I came away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am perhaps the fuller of it, becau&s;e it has been the ruin of my family, and of my children; and I think,
<PB N="80" REF="025384_0079_0FCCE73C62D265F0">
if ever poor woman was unhappy with a gentleman that had not one bad quality in him, it was I; Sir James, as I told you, was &s;uch a man, for every thing el&s;e, as there are few &s;uch in the world; but he hated religion, and that has ruined us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would make any one laugh to hear you talk of being ruined; why, are you not left happy, ea&s;y, and plea&s;ant? is not your elde&s;t &s;on a baronet, and has 1400l. a year? is not your &s;econd &s;on very well provided for? have not your daughters 5000l a piece fortune left them? and, are you not left &s;o rich, you know not what to do with it all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;peak of ruin as you under&s;tand it, bro|ther; I think a family without religion, is a family ruin|ed, and that in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e, that ruin can be under|&s;tood in: if I were to marry again, I would not marry the be&s;t Duke in the nation, that would not endeavour to carry me to heaven, and go there him&s;elf. The com|mand of the &s;cripture is plain in it, <HI>Be not unequally yok|ed,</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 14.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir James did not hinder your prayers, &s;i&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he not? Sir James is in his grave, and it is not my part to &s;ay what he did; but it is the mutual prayers of hu&s;band and wife together that is meant in that &s;cripture. Do you think Sir James prayed with his wife?</P>

<P>And do you think that is the life of a Chri&s;tian, or the manner of a Chri&s;tian family, brother? You and I were not bred up &s;o, and yet our father was a gentle|man, and wanted neither family nor fortune equal to any of them. Sir James is in his grave, and I have no more to &s;ay of that; but if I were as young as I was when I mar|ried him, and were to chu&s;e again, I would not marry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be&s;t nobleman in the nation, if he was not a religious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>This is ju&s;t my daughter again.</P>

<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, brother, con&s;ider another thing: how many young women and young men too, who have been religiou&s;ly bred, has this way of marrying been a &s;nare to? that, when they come to hu&s;bands with no religion, or to giddy, loo&s;e, profane wives, they drop all their own principles, and become empty of all religion too at la&s;t. You know how it has been with our brothers and &s;i&s;ters, as I hinted to you before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no arguing with you, &s;i&s;ter, who have had &s;o much experience of it: but I tell my daughter, that perhaps, &s;he may convert her hu&s;band.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know my niece's ca&s;e, and &s;o I can &s;ay little to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; but if this be it, that &s;he refu&s;es a man for his be|ing of no religion, &s;he is in the right; &s;he is a good reli|gious child her&s;elf: my &s;i&s;ter educated all your children very well, and if &s;he marry a gentleman, as the times go now, that thinks religion below him, and unbecoming, as mo&s;t of them do, &s;he is undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>So &s;he &s;ays, and has ju&s;t your arguments; that made me &s;ay, you had been documenting her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, brother, not I; but I'll tell you what, I have been a <HI>memento</HI> to the family; and don't doubt but my &s;i&s;ter might &s;hew them the danger of it, by their aunt's example. I pray God they make take warning. I know &s;he was not wanting to them in her in&s;truction, and in cautioning them again&s;t every thing that was hurt|ful; and if &s;he forgot this of cautioning them never to marry a man of no religion, then &s;he was not that wi&s;e women I took her for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not who has cautioned her, nor who has in&s;tructed her; but if I had not taken it up very warmly, &s;he had ruined her&s;elf with her nicety. I'll tell you how it is.</P>
<P>[Here he tells her the whole &s;tory of his daughter and the gentleman, to the time of his coming from home, he not knowing what had happened &s;ince]</P>

<P>Well, brother, you will allow me to be free

<P>Yes, yes: I expected that from you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by inclination. She forces her own inclination: for her &s;i&s;ter &s;ays, &s;he loves the gentleman, and has owned it; and yet upon this &s;imple nicety, &s;he pretended to cro&s;s her&s;elf, affront the gentle|man, and di&s;oblige her father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>And will not all that convince you then, that &s;he acts by &s;trength of judgement, and upon principles of con&s;cience? If it be as you &s;ay, it is the noble&s;t re|&s;olution that ever I heard, &s;ince the &s;tory of St. Ca|therine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't tell me of your noble re&s;olutions, and your fine principles; it is a fir&s;t principle, an original com|mand of God, that children &s;hould obey their parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, brother, where the parent commands no|thing that cla&s;hes with the laws of God; but then, bro|ther, our authority cea&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am &s;ure this match is for her advantage, and I'll make her have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a &s;evere re&s;olution, and if it be again&s;t her con&s;cience, you may fail in all you re&s;olve upon; be&s;ides, it is evident you ought not to re&s;olve &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! am not I her father? has it not been al|ways the right of fathers to give their daughters in mar|riage? nay, to bargain for them, even without their knowledge: did not Caleb promi&s;e his daughter Ach&s;ah in marriage to him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hould &s;mite Kirjath&s;epher, not knowing who it &s;hould be, or whether the girl &s;hould like him or no? and are there not many &s;uch in&s;tances in the &s;cripture?</P>

<P>All that is true, brother: but I do not think the laws of God or man give parents that authority now.</P>

<P>Then you allow my daughters to marry who they plea&s;e, without putting any weight upon my con&s;ent one way or other; would you give your daughters that liberty?</P>

<P>No, brother, you wrong me; but there is a great

difference between your negative authority and your po&s;i|tive authority, in the ca&s;e of a daughter; as there is a great difference between your authority in the marriage of a daughter and the marriage of a &s;on.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know my lady &s;i&s;ter is a nice civilian: pray explain your&s;elf.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can take all your banters patiently, brother, and I will explain my&s;elf, contradict me if you can; I di&s;tingui&s;h them thus: if your daughter de&s;ires to marry any per&s;on you don't like, I grant that you have power by the law of God to forbid her po&s;itively: the &s;cripture is plain, you have power to di&s;&s;olve even a vow or promi&s;e of hers to marry, or not to marry at all. But if your daughter is not willing to marry one you may like, I do not think you have the &s;ame right to command; for you might then command her to marry a per&s;on &s;he may have an abhorrence of, and an aver&s;ion to, which could not be; the very laws of matrimony forbid it; &s;he could not repeat the office of matrimony at her marriage, viz. to love and honour him: and to promi&s;e what &s;he knew at the &s;ame time would be impo&s;&s;ible for her to perform, would be to perjure her&s;elf (for the marriage promi&s;e is a &s;olemn oath) and to deceive her hu&s;band in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner; neither of which would be lawful for her to do.</P>

<P>That is becau&s;e you do not act like a Chri&s;tian, brother; you make your&s;elf a terror to your children; this dares not &s;ee you; tho&s;e at home dare not &s;peak to you: why, what do you mean, brother? you did not treat them thus, when they were little: do you con&s;ider what they are now? that they are women grown, and

ought to be treated as &s;uch? and de&s;erving women too they are, that the world &s;ees; and thus expo&s;e your&s;elf mo&s;t wretchedly to treat them thus: I am very free with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do I treat them? What, to provide a gen|tleman of 2000l. a-year for the younge&s;t, a hand&s;ome complete young gentleman as any the town can produce, and every way unexceptionable; nay, &s;he owned her&s;elf he was one &s;he could like very well; and to have her af|front him and her father; and to di&s;mi&s;s him of her own head without con&s;ulting me, or &s;taying till I came to town! and this after five weeks keeping him company, and when &s;he knew the writings were drawing for her marriage-&s;ettlement; is this a decent way of treating a fa|ther? I think you are free with me indeed, to take their parts in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, brother, &s;uppo&s;e all this to be ju&s;t as you relate it, yet, if the young people could not bit it, do we not always, when we make propo&s;als one to another for our children, make this condition, viz. if the young people can agree? and do we not put them together to talk with one another, on purpo&s;e that they may be ac|quainted, and &s;ee whether they can like one another, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and &s;o did I: has he not waited upon her lady&s;hip. I tell you, five weeks? was that not time e|nough to know whether &s;he liked him or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time enough to like or di&s;like, I grant it; and &s;he tells you plainly, &s;he does not like, and cannot mar|ry him: what would you have? And, as to putting him off in your ab&s;ence, &s;he &s;ays, &s;he told you her mind po&s;itively, before you went out of town, and would have given you her rea&s;ons for it; but you treated her-with &s;o little temper, that &s;he had no room to &s;peak; and at la&s;t told her; you would have none of her rea&s;ons, but expected &s;he would have him: how do you an&s;wer that, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew what &s;he had to &s;ay well enough; howe|ver, I gave her till my return to con&s;ider of it; what had &s;he to do to turn him off without my knowledge, and af|front

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's all an&s;wered by what I &s;aid before, that &s;he told you po&s;itively, before you went out of town, &s;he would never have him, and indeed had re&s;olved then to &s;ee him no more; for what &s;hould a young woman keep a man company for, when &s;he re&s;olves not to have him? whatever you may think, brother, it would not have been very hand&s;ome on her &s;ide; be&s;ides, I can a&s;&s;ure you, your daughters are none of tho&s;e women, that do any thing unbecoming.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never but once, that &s;he might di&s;mi&s;s him ci|villy, and that was merely a force of your own upon her, becau&s;e your pa&s;&s;ion with her obliged her to do that work her&s;elf, which you ought to have done for her.</P>

</SP>

genuine interpretation, it would help to convince you of all I have &s;aid: be angry, but be not in a pa&s;&s;ion; to be angry may be ju&s;t, as the occa&s;ion for it may make it ne|ce&s;&s;ary; but be not immoderately angry, for that is to &s;in, and no cau&s;e of anger can make that nece&s;&s;ary; and therefore, another text &s;ays, "Let all bitterne&s;s and wrath be put away from among you," Eph. iv. 13 The&s;e are &s;criptures, brother, for our conduct even with &s;tran|gers: but, when we come to talk of children, is it not ten thou&s;and times more binding? we cannot be in a pa&s;|&s;ion at any body without &s;in; but, to be in a pa&s;&s;ion at our children, that is all di&s;traction, and an abomination that tends to nothing but mi&s;chief.</P>

<P>No, Sir, there was a great deal more; they did not part with di&s;gu&s;t at all; I am per&s;uaded he loves her entirely, and I am &s;ure &s;he loves him too? I wi&s;h &s;he did not.</P>

<P>And is &s;he not a double fool then, to thwart thus both her fortune and her fancy, and all for &s;he knows not what? Had he been a fawning hypocrite, that could have talked of religion, whether he had any or no, &s;he would have taken him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>She would not have been ea&s;ily deceived, Sir, for &s;he lays the whole &s;tre&s;s of her life's welfare upon it; it is a &s;olid principle with her, which &s;he cannot go from, and which &s;he thinks her fancy and fortune and all things in this world, ought to &s;ubmit to.</P>

<P>Well, I think they are both fools; he for being &s;o open, and &s;he for being &s;o nice; it will be long enough before &s;he has &s;uch another offer, I dare &s;ay.</P>
</SP>

<P>I believe that is none of her affliction. Sir; &s;he is only troubled at di&s;obliging you, which &s;he had no po&s;&s;i|bility to avoid, without oppre&s;&s;ing her con&s;cience, and making her&s;elf mi&s;erable.</P>

<SP>

<P>Why, Sir, to name no more, here is a gentle|man, who, by his profe&s;&s;ed choice of her, and extraordi|nary propo&s;als to her, has given undoubted te&s;timony of his loving her very &s;incerely.

<P>I think you were very &s;incere, Sir, &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>O Madam, &s;aid he, I do not &s;ay I was a brute for own|ing it, but I was a brute for living in that horrid manner, and yet thinking that any &s;ober woman could entertain a thought of having me.</P>
<P>I am very &s;orry, &s;aid the lady, it happened &s;o.</P>
<P>I am very glad, Madam, that &s;he treated me &s;o, re|plied

<P>No, &s;i&s;ter, &s;ays he, I don't banter; and my &s;topping to &s;peak with you was for this rea&s;on; I do not a&s;k to &s;peak with your &s;i&s;ter, but I beg you will tell her from me very &s;eriou&s;ly, that &s;he has been a better in&s;tructor to me than my father or mother, or all the tutors and friends I had in my life; &s;he has convinced me, that I was a mon&s;ter, a &s;candalous fellow, that ought to have been a|&s;hamed to pretend to a woman that had the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of her education, or of him that made her. I have rea&s;on to give thanks to God every day I live, that ever I &s;aw her face, and that I had that repul&s;e from her. Tell her I recommend it to her, to pre&s;erve that noble, heavenly re&s;olution, which &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had taken up, viz. never to marry any but a religious man: She is undone if &s;he break it; and though I am never able to de&s;erve her, yet I will always think of her as the mother of all that is or ever will be good in me, and value the memory of her accordingly! He waited no an&s;wer, but, with all po&s;&s;ible civility, took his leave, and his hor&s;es being at the door, took hor&s;e and went away. She waited on him to the door, and, as he was paying his re&s;pects to her, &s;itting on his hor&s;e, he &s;aid to her, Dear madam, I hope you will give your &s;i&s;ter a particular account of what I have &s;aid to you. She an&s;wered, &s;he would not fail to do it with all the exactne&s;s po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, &s;he ran up to her &s;i&s;ter, but be|fore &s;he could &s;peak to her, her younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter cried out to her, Si&s;ter, before you &s;peak, do not a&s;k me to go down; for I will not &s;ee him.]</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE former dialogue having put an end to the court|&s;hip between the gentleman and his mi&s;tre&s;s for the pre&s;ent, and there being &s;ome interval of time be|tween tho&s;e things and the remaining part of the &s;tory, that interval is filled up with another little affair in the &s;ame family, of &s;till a nicer nature than the other, though not carried &s;o far.</P>
<P>The father had frequently di&s;cour&s;ed the&s;e things with his elde&s;t daughter, in the ca&s;e of her &s;i&s;ter, as is to be &s;een in the la&s;t dialogue, and found, by her di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;he was pretty much of her &s;i&s;ter's mind, in the mat|ter of chu&s;ing a hu&s;band: but, having a gentleman in his thoughts for her, who had the character of a very &s;ober, religious per&s;on, he made no que&s;tion but he &s;hould di&s;|po&s;e this daughter both to her &s;atisfaction and his own.</P>
<P>It was with a view to this de&s;ign, that he had je&s;ted with her, in one of their la&s;t di&s;cour&s;es, that he had a religious hu&s;band in &s;tore for her, and that he hoped he &s;hould give her no occa&s;ion to play the fool, as her &s;i&s;ter had done.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, he took occa&s;ion to tell her, one evening after &s;upper, that what he had &s;poken in a way of a je&s;t to her, at &s;uch a time, was really no je&s;t in his own thoughts; that he had been &s;poken to by a certain gentleman, a con&s;iderable merchant in the city, who&s;e elde&s;t &s;on had an inclination to pay his re&s;pects to her; and I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear, &s;ays the father, he has the character of a very &s;ober, religious gentleman; and, I am &s;ure, his father and mother are very good people: indeed the whole family are noted for a religious family, and I know no family in the whole city that have a bet|ter character.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="025384_0106_0FCD1089A69286E8">
She made him no an&s;wer at all, till he began with her again, Why are you &s;o &s;ilent, child, &s;aid her father. Have you nothing to &s;ay? Methinks when I look back on the di&s;order which the ob&s;tinacy of your &s;i&s;ter has put us all in, I would be glad to have every difficulty re|moved before hand with you, and therefore I &s;peak ear|ly, that if you have any objections I may hear them, and not be driven afterwards to a&s;k people pardon, for ill u&s;|age which I have had no hand in; and I would have you u&s;e your freedom now, that I may take nothing ill from you afterwards. And thus he pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;peak.</P>

<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in no ha&s;te, Sir, to marry; the times terrify me; the education, the manners, the conduct of gentlemen is now &s;o univer&s;ally loo&s;e, that I think for a young woman to marry, is like a hor&s;e ru&s;hing into the battle; I have no courage &s;o much as to think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there are a great many &s;ober civilized young gentlemen in the world; it is hard to reproach them all, becau&s;e many of them are wicked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it is tho&s;e civilized people which I &s;peak of; for even tho&s;e who now pa&s;s for &s;ober, are not like what it was formerly. When you look narrowly among them as they are in the gro&s;s, ten rakes to one &s;ober man; &s;o, among the &s;ober men, that are called civilized men, and who&s;e morals will bear any character, there are ten A|thei&s;ts to one religious man; and which is wor&s;e than all the re&s;t, if a woman finds a religious man, it is three to one again, whether he agrees with her in principles; and &s;o &s;he is in danger of being undone, even in the be&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard the like! Why, what are my daughters made of? What, is nothing good enough in the world for you! If you all go on &s;uch niceties I mu&s;t never more think of marrying any of you.</P>

<P>You have heard &s;o much &s;aid by me, Sir, in my &s;i&s;ter's behalf, that you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily believe I am of the &s;ame opinion; that is to &s;ay, that I would not marry a man that made no profe&s;&s;ion of religion upon any ac|count

what&s;oever, were his e&s;tate, his per&s;on, his &s;obrie|ty, his qualifications ever &s;o inviting. I need not give rea&s;ons for this, Sir: what I have &s;aid, what my &s;i&s;ter and my aunts have &s;aid on that account, is enough; but it is my misfortune, Sir, to have another &s;cruple beyond all this, and which the ca&s;e of my &s;i&s;ter gave no occa&s;ion to mention.</P>

<P>[Though her father &s;eemed to give it over thus in di&s;|cour&s;e with his daughter, yet he had gone farther with the gentleman that had made the propo&s;al, than he had &s;old her; and had invited the father and mother to din|ner
<PB N="112" REF="025384_0111_0FCD10942C1B2B10">
the next day, with an intent that they &s;hould &s;ee and be acquainted with his daughters; &s;uppo&s;ing at the &s;ame time, that they would bring the young gentleman with them.</P>
<P>They came to dinner accordingly; but, as the father knew well enough that the education of their &s;on was in a different way from that of his daughter, and that &s;he had declared her&s;elf &s;o po&s;itively in that part, he had de|&s;ired them privately not to bring their &s;on to dinner: when they were come, and before his daughter was cal|led in, the father told them how the ca&s;e &s;tood between him and his elde&s;t daughter, and that he &s;aw no remedy but this, that, as he had not told her any thing of the de&s;ign of his invitation, or that they were the family he had de&s;igned her a hu&s;band out of; &s;o, if they thought fit to turn their eyes to his &s;econd daughter, he was in hopes &s;he would have more with than to run into the ri|diculous &s;cruples of the elde&s;t. They pre&s;ently agreed, that it was not at all rea&s;onable to force the inclination of the young lady; that they &s;ay no room to bring the opinions in religion together, in their children, their opinions at that time differing extremely, and their &s;on being as po&s;itive, they believed, as his daughter: &s;o they &s;aid with all their hearts, if their &s;on could fancy the &s;e|cond daughter as well, it &s;hould be the &s;ame thing to them: however, the mother of the young gentleman a&s;k|ed him, if he would give her leave to enter into di&s;cour&s;e with his daughter upon the &s;ubject of her &s;cruples? He told her, with all his heart, for he would be glad to have her change her mind; becau&s;e, as on the one hand, he &s;hould be very well &s;atisfied to bring them together, &s;o he really thought her notions were empty and &s;imple, and &s;hould be glad &s;he was made wi&s;er; but then, Madam, &s;ays he, you mu&s;t not di&s;cover the real de&s;ign, for, if you do, &s;he will be backward to &s;peak freely. She agreed to that, and &s;o this private di&s;cour&s;e ended; and his daughters be|ing introduced, and the u&s;ual ceremonies pa&s;&s;ed, they went to dinner, the young ladies knowing nothing of the de|&s;ign of their being invited.</P>
<P>The father and mother were charmed at the conduct: of the young woman, her per&s;on and manner, the mo|de&s;ty

of their behaviour, and above all the politene&s;s and pertinence of their di&s;cour&s;e; and &s;omething happening to be &s;aid about marrying, the father falls to rallying his daughters upon their nicety in that point, that nothing would &s;erve them but religious men. There is my daugh|ter&mdash;, &s;ays he, (pointing to his younge&s;t) I think nothing will do for her but a par&s;on; &s;he refu&s;ed a gentle|man of 2000l. a-year t'other day, becau&s;e he was not reli|gious enough for her.</P>
<P>No, Madam, &s;ays his daughter, my father means, be|cau&s;e he had no religion at all; hardly &s;o much as a coach hor&s;e; for a coach-hor&s;e often knows the way to the church-door.</P>
<P>That alters the ca&s;e quite, &s;aid Madam: why, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, you would not have married your daughter to a brute! a man without religion is a wor&s;e brute than a hor&s;e! for the hor&s;e obeys the dictates of nature, but an Athei&s;t acts again&s;t rea&s;on, nature and common &s;en&s;e. I would not marry a child of mine to a man of no religion, if he had ten thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays he, there's my daughter&mdash;(pointing to his elde&s;t) &s;he goes farther; &s;he is not &s;atisfied with a religious hu&s;band, but &s;he mu&s;t have one of her own o|pinion in religion, that goes to the church where &s;he goes to church, and wor&s;hips ju&s;t as the wor&s;hips: I don't think &s;he will ever be plea&s;ed, while &s;he lives.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;ays the elde&s;t, I expected my father would be upon my bones next; my father talks of my opinion, as if I was &s;omething that nobody el&s;e is; as if I was one of the new prophets, or of &s;ome &s;trange, &s;ingular opin|ion, &s;omething mon&s;trous in religion: all I &s;ay is, that as I profe&s;s nothing but what I think is right, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> thou&s;ands agree with me in, if ever I do marry, as I &s;uppo&s;e I never &s;hall, why &s;hould I not chu&s;e to have my hu&s;band and I of the &s;ame opinion, that we may &s;erve God together?</P>
<P>Madam, &s;ays the old lady, your father does but je&s;t with you; he can never oppo&s;e &s;o rea&s;onable a thing as that; I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I think it is much to be de&s;ired; I will not &s;ay but there is a po&s;&s;ibility of doing well with|out

it; it may not be a &s;in; but I own, it is better, if it can be &s;o.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure it would be a &s;in in me, &s;ays the daughter, becau&s;e it would be again&s;t my con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, &s;ays the other, that's true; and you are very much in the right to in&s;i&s;t upon it, if it be &s;o; and no doubt, your father will be far from offering any thing that may &s;eem to be a violence upon your con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>I offer violence, Madam! &s;ays the father, nay, they are above that; they take upon them to &s;ay, I will, and I won't, to their father; I a&s;&s;ure you they are pa&s;t my offering violence to them.</P>
<P>In nothing, Madam, but this crabbed bu&s;ine&s;s of mar|rying, &s;ays the daughter, and there indeed we do take &s;ome liberty with my father.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;ays the old lady, you mu&s;t allow liberty there; marriage is a ca&s;e for life, and mu&s;t be well con|&s;idered; and the young ladies are to bear it, fall it how it will, you know, for better or wor&s;e: they had need be allowed &s;ome liberty there.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Madam, &s;ays the younge&s;t, all the liberty we take is in negatives only; we don't offer to take any bo|dy that my father don't like, only we don't care to take &s;uch as we don't like our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The old gentleman then put in: Upon my word, Sir, &s;ays he, I think your daughters are in the right; for cer|tainly, though we may refu&s;e to let them marry where they may chu&s;e, yet I can't think we &s;hould deny them the liberty to refu&s;e what we may offer; or el&s;e we may as well give them in marriage, as was done in old days, and never let them &s;ee one another.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter turned her head towards her father as this, but &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you, Betty, &s;ays her father; but &s;he &s;aid nothing &s;till; and the old lady, finding the di&s;cour&s;e pinch|ed a little hard, began &s;ome other talk, and &s;oon after, the men withdrawing, left the ladies together.</P>
<P>When the men were gone; hark ye, &s;ays the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gentlewoman, I was willing to break off the di&s;cour&s;e ju&s;t now, becau&s;e I was afraid it was offen&s;ive to your

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was very much obliged to you, Madam, for breaking off the di&s;cour&s;e; for my father is pa&s;&s;ionate, and is &s;ometimes &s;o out of temper with us upon the&s;e points, that we are gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ly grieved at it, and particularly that he will not give us leave to &s;peak.</P>

<P>I am &s;ure it has almo&s;t broke my heart.</P>

<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry for it; for indeed I think yours is nothing but what every woman that is a Chri&s;tian ought to think her&s;elf obliged to: what dreadful doings mu&s;t there be, when a religious woman marries a wretch that is a de&s;pi&s;er of God! a Chri&s;tian to be linked to an infi|del! one that &s;erves God to be joined to one of God's e|nemies! and then to love &s;uch a man too! the very thought is enough to fill one with confu&s;ion! take it which way you will, it is equally di&s;mal. Fir&s;t, to be married to him, and not love him, that's a hell upon earth! and to love him! one that we mu&s;t reflect on as a limb of the devil! a &s;on of perdition! to embrace one that God ab|hors! to have the affections bound to one that God hates! what contradictions are the&s;e! what horror mu&s;t fill the &s;oul while they live! and what dreadful thoughts mu&s;t croud into one's mind, if &s;uch a man &s;hould come to die before us! dear young lady, &s;ays &s;he, you are happy that you could defend your&s;elf again&s;t &s;uch a propo&s;al.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, your charge upon me is a little hard; I think the arguments are as &s;trong almo&s;t on my part as my &s;i&s;ter's, though they are of another na|ture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't &s;ay &s;o, Madam; it is true, there is &s;omething to be &s;aid in your ca&s;e, but nothing &s;o e&s;&s;ential as in the other; and, as I &s;aid, methinks it looks as if you wanted charity: I hope, child, you do not think all opinions but your own are fatal to be pro|fe&s;&s;ed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, not at all: I hope there are good people of all per&s;ua&s;ions; but if I did not think
<PB N="116" REF="025384_0115_0FCD109F6D2EECD0">
my own be&s;t, how could I an&s;wer the cleaving to it my|&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far you are right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Madam, though in charity I ought to allow others to be good Chri&s;tians, and that I &s;hould, and do keep up a friendly corre&s;pondence with many who di&s;&s;ent from my judgment in religious matters, yet there is a great deal of difference between charity to them, and union with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have &s;tudied the point thoroughly, I perceive; I under&s;tand you perfectly; pray go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, in di&s;cour&s;e with my father, I could never u&s;e any freedom, or obtain leave to propo&s;e my &s;cru|ples, with the rea&s;ons of them; but I hope you will allow me liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, for I am glad to enter into &s;o curious a debate with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Religion, Madam, without doors is one thing, religion within doors is another. In the town, among my acquaintance, and in the neighbourhood, a due charity to every one is what I think the Chri&s;tian principle calls for, and I conver&s;e freely with good people of every opinion, extending charity to all in lowline&s;s of mind, e&s;teeming every one better than my&s;elf: but, within doors, the ca&s;e alters; family religion is a &s;ociable thing, and God &s;hould be wor&s;hipped there with one heart, and with one voice; there can be no &s;eparation there, without a dreadful breach both of charity and duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;tart a new thing to me, indeed, and it is &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be true, Madam, that there may be divers opinions in the nation, without breach of charity; but I believe it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be &s;o in a family, without breach of affection: what union, what opene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of de&s;ires, what perfect agreement (without which, a man and wife can never be &s;aid to di&s;charge the duty of their relation) can there be where there is a diver&s;ity of wor&s;hip, a cla&s;hing of opinions, and an oppo&s;ition of principles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But child, you carry it too high; if they differ in principles, indeed, there is &s;omething to be &s;aid;
<PB N="117" REF="025384_0116_0FCD10A20AFD9170">
but we are talking of a difference in opinion only, where the fundamentals may be the &s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I recal the word principles then, and join with you to confine it to opinion only; but it is the &s;ame thing in its proportion; the union can never be perfect, while the differing &s;entiments of things leave room for di&s;putes between them: for example, Madam, the differing forms of wor&s;hip; one will pray by a book only, the other without a book wholly; this is as light a difference as can be &s;poken of. But how &s;hall God be wor&s;hipped with the united voice and affections of the whole family even in this ca&s;e? what helps will two &s;uch relations be to one another, in praying to God either by them&s;elves, or with their families?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, you &s;en&s;ibly affect me now with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not enough, Madam, that they being &s;incerely religious apart, &s;hall wor&s;hip God in their own &s;eparate way, though better &s;o than not at all; but the zeal, the affection, the uniting their hearts in their wor|&s;hip, their praying with and for one another; this alas! is all lo&s;t. Then, &s;ay it be in the public wor&s;hip, there they make a woeful &s;eparation, God, that has made them one, is &s;erved by them as two; God has joined them together, and they part a&s;under in their &s;erving him; God has made them one: how does this con&s;i&s;t, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee you are full it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>In their public wor&s;hip, &s;acraments, &amp;c. nei|ther one heart or one voice goes with their wor&s;hip; tho' they communicate in the &s;ame ordinance, they &s;et up two altars; one wor&s;hips here, and one there: and though their faces are both &s;et heaven-wards, perhaps they turn back to back as &s;oon as they go out of their doors to the public wor&s;hip of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very clear in it, indeed, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is not all, Madam, there are &s;everal fa|mily circum&s;tances be&s;ides the&s;e, which make union of o|pinion ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: as fir&s;t, family-wor&s;hip is a thing, without which families, however privately and &s;e|parately devout, are coupled with heathens, Jer. x. 25.
<PB N="118" REF="025384_0117_0FCD10A32B6056F0">
<HI>Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen, and upon the families which call not upon thy name:</HI> whatever there may be in public wor&s;hip, there &s;hould always be an exact harmony in private; and how can this be, where either of them di&s;&s;ents from the manner? If there is a di&s;cord in the manner, there can be no concord in the performance, no union in the affections; in a word, their prayers will be hindered; and who would be thus unequally yoked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expected you would name that &s;cripture, though it was certain that was &s;poken principally to tho&s;e who married with unbelievers, which is a different ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, we come to another ca&s;e; &s;uppo&s;e the hu&s;band and wife we are &s;peaking of have children, what foundation of eternal &s;chi&s;m is there in the family! &s;ome of the children adhere to the father, &s;ome to the mother; &s;ome wor&s;hip in this mount, and &s;ome no where but at Jeru&s;alem; &s;ome go with the fa|ther, &s;ome with the mother; &s;ome kneel down with the father, &s;ome with the mother; till, as they grow up, they really learn not to kneel down at all: family education, united in&s;truction, caution, example, they are all dread|fully mangled and divided, till in the end they come to nothing; and the children grow out of government, pa&s;t in&s;truction, and all lo&s;t. The&s;e, Madam, are &s;ome of the rea&s;ons I would have given my father (if he would have had patience with me) why, in his late propo&s;al he had to make, I de&s;ired that I night be at liberty to chu&s;e by my own principles, and not at random, as too many do</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lad.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, do you not allow, that if both parties are &s;incerely pious and religious, that they may make allowances to one another, and make con&s;cience of hindering and palling back one another in the duties of religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Madam, as to that, two things of|fer to my view, for I have often con&s;idered them both: Fir&s;t, the more &s;incere in religion either of them is, the more fixed in principle and opinion its likely they will be, and the farther from making abatements to one another; and e&s;pecially, &s;econdly, in the great article of education, and in&s;tructing their children; for what tender mother,
<PB N="119" REF="025384_0118_0FCD10A60221E9E8">
that having fixed her opinion, as &s;he thinks, in the be&s;t manner and way, could bear not to have their children brought up in the &s;ame &s;entiments of religion, which &s;he thinks mo&s;t agreeable to the revealed will of God? And the more con&s;cientious and religious &s;he was, the more &s;teadily &s;he would cleave to it as her duty; and the like of the man: &s;o that here would be a con&s;tant heart-burn|ing and unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Madam, I think your rea&s;ons good, and you guard them &s;o well with &s;elf evident conclu&s;ions, that I cannot think your father can de&s;ire you to break through them: if you think it will be for your &s;ervice, I'll mention it again to him.</P>

<P>Truly I have; but I &s;ay now I have been wrong to them both; and indeed more to my younge&s;t daugh|ter than to my elde&s;t: for, &s;he refu&s;ed the gentleman becau&s;e he really had no religion at all, and yet I was in a violent pa&s;&s;ion with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, that was hard indeed: for, if there be all this to be &s;aid, why a woman &s;hould not marry a man of a different opinion in religion, there mu&s;t be much more to be &s;aid why &s;he &s;hould not marry one that de&s;pi&s;es religion and this indeed I &s;aid to your younge&s;t daugh|ter, applauding her conduct, though I did not know that you had u&s;ed her hardly on that account.</P>

<P>Truly, his own folly too; he told her &s;o directly, in &s;o many words; owned he had not troubled his head about religion, and did not intend it; made a banter and je&s;t of religion in general: told her, it was a road he had never travelled, and that he intended to chu&s;e a wife fir&s;t, and then perhaps he might chu&s;e his religion.</P>

<P>It was not long before the young ladies put their fa|ther in mind of his appointment; for, being mightily plea&s;ed with the old gentlewoman, they had a great mind to pay the vi&s;it, that the acquaintance might be &s;ettled.

<P>While they were here, the good old gentlewoman, who entertained them with great civility, diverted the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

with every thing &s;he could think of; and, after abun|dance of other u&s;ual chat, they fell to talking the old &s;tories over again about religious hu&s;bands, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ity there was to have both hu&s;band and wife join their endeavours for propagating family-religon. The young|e&s;t daughter repeated her mother's maxim; Madam, &s;ays &s;he, it was a rule my mother gave us at her death, and which I &s;ee &s;o much weight in, that I de&s;ire to make it the foundation upon which I would build all my pro&s;pects of happine&s;s, viz. <HI>That a religious life is the only heaven upon earth.</HI> I have added &s;ome other things to it &s;ince, which my own ob&s;ervation directs me to, but which I be|lieve you will allow to be in their degree ju&s;t, &s;uch as the&s;e, viz. That a religious family is one of the greate&s;t com|forts of a religious life: that where hu&s;band and wife are not mutually, at lea&s;t, if not equally religious, there can never be truly a religious family: that therefore, for a religiou&s;ly inclined woman to marry an irreligious hu&s;|band, is to entail per&s;ecution upon her&s;elf as long as &s;he lives. The old lady replied, I find, Madam, as young as you are, you have &s;tudied this point very well. In|deed, Madam, &s;aid the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, my &s;i&s;ter has had oc|ca&s;ion for it; for the has been hard put to it, what with the offers of an extraordinary match, my father's violent pa&s;&s;ion, and (among our&s;elves, Madam,) not a little the importunity of her own affections, that, for my part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I wonder &s;he has been able to hand her ground. They are three powerful arguments, I acknow|ledge, &s;aid the old lady: pray, Madam, as far as it may be proper, let me know &s;omething of the matter; you need not mention per&s;ons; I am not inqui&s;itive on that &s;core, I a&s;&s;ure you. If my &s;i&s;ter gives me leave, Ma|dam, &s;ays the elde&s;t; the younge&s;t &s;aid &s;he left her at li|berty. Why then, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, my father&mdash;. [Here &s;he gives her an abridgement of the whole &s;tory, but without the mo&s;t extravagant part of her father's pa&s;|&s;ion, that it might not reflect upon him.]</P>
<P>Well, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, I will not &s;ay all my thoughts on this &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tory, becau&s;e your &s;i&s;ter is here; for it is a rule with me, never to prai&s;e any one to their face, or reproach any behind their backs; but it is an extraor|dinary
<PB N="124" REF="025384_0123_0FCD10AE6FA065E8">
&s;tory indeed; and, turning to the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, &s;he &s;aid to her very &s;eriou&s;ly, I pray God fortify you, child, in &s;uch re&s;olutions, and grant that you may have the true end of them fully an&s;wered; that, if ever you do marry, it may be to a man as uncommonly &s;erious, pious, and &s;incere, as you have been inimitably re&s;olute in refu&s;|ing &s;uch great offers, for the want of it. Then, turning to her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, &s;ays &s;he, this &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tory puts me in mind of another &s;tory, which a very good man, an old acquaintance of ours, told me the other day, and which, they &s;ay, has ju&s;t now happened to a young gentleman that he knows in the country; it is a pretty way off too, but he told us his name; I believe my hu&s;band knows the name, and I tell you the &s;tory for your &s;i&s;ter's encou|ragement: who knows, but &s;he may be a means, by &s;uch unexampled conduct, as this of hers is, to bring the gentleman &s;he has had upon her hands to &s;ome &s;en&s;e of his condition?</P>
<P>There is a gentleman in that country, of a very good family, and of a very great e&s;tate, but young, and, I think he &s;aid a batchelor; he is not above &s;ix and twen|ty, and has between two and three thou&s;and a-year; it &s;eems he is a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed, well-bred man, a hand|&s;ome charming per&s;on: and every thing that could be &s;aid of a man, to &s;et him out, he &s;aid of him: he had, indeed, been of a family, he &s;aid, that had been imi|nently wicked, &s;o that the very name of religion had &s;carce been heard of among them for &s;ome ages; and young Ma&s;ter, &s;aid my friend, could not be &s;aid well to be wor&s;e than his father or grandfather who went before him.</P>
<P>However, it happened it &s;eems, that he went to Lon|don, I think, &s;ays &s;he, my friend &s;aid it was la&s;t winter, and when he came back, he was &s;trangely melancholy and dejected, and quite altered in his conver&s;ation; in|&s;tead of riding abroad and vi&s;iting the gentlemen, and receiving vi&s;its from them, he &s;hunned all company, walk|ed abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> his gardens and woods all alone till very late in the night, and all his &s;ervants wondered what ailed hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; that one night they were in a great fright for him, know|ing he was out on foot, and alone; when, about ten o'|clock
<PB N="125" REF="025384_0124_0FCD10B1A1D4D3E0">
at night, he came in with a poor, hone&s;t country fellow with him, that lived almo&s;t three miles off; that the next day he took that poor man home to his hou&s;e, and &s;ent for his wife and children, who all lived before in a poor cottage on the wa&s;te, and provided for them; gave the poor man a farm rent free for twelve years, which always went for 22 l. a-year, with a good hou&s;e; lent him a &s;tock for manuring it too, and made him bailiff of the manor, and, in &s;hort, made a man of him. Where|upon every body &s;aid, that the e&s;quire had been in &s;ome great danger or other, and the poor man had &s;aved his life; and, when &s;omebody happened to &s;ay as much to him one day, he an&s;wered, yes, that poor man had done more than &s;aved his life, for he had &s;aved his &s;oul.</P>
<P>It &s;eems this poor labouring wretch, though mi&s;erable to the la&s;t degree as to the world, was yet known to be a mo&s;t religious, &s;erious Chri&s;tian, and a very mode&s;t, humble, but knowing and &s;en&s;ible man, and he had been di&s;cour&s;ing good things with him, and, from that time forward, the poor man was &s;carce ever from him; that it was ob&s;erved by &s;ome of the &s;ervants, that the next morn|ing after the poor man came home with him he came a|gain, and brought a Bible with him, which was left in the young gentleman's chamber, and that this poor man and he were often locked up an hour or two together, al|mo&s;t every day; that next market-day the poor man went to the next market-town, upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s for the gen|tleman, and brought home a new Bible, and &s;everal other religious books, and that his ma&s;ter was continually read|ing them; in &s;hort, our friend tells us, &s;aid &s;he, that he is become the mo&s;t &s;ober, religious Chri&s;tian, that, for a man of his fortune, and quality, has ever been heard of, and that he is admired by all the country for it.</P>
<P>I tell you this &s;tory, Madam, turning to the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, to confirm you in your re&s;olution, and to let you &s;ee, that there are &s;ome religious gentlemen in the world &s;till, and that the gentlemen may be a&s;hamed, when they pretend to &s;ay, religion is below their quality; for my friend &s;ays, that this gentleman is, with his religion, al&s;o the humble&s;t, &s;weete&s;t tempered creature in the world, ready to do good offices to the poore&s;t in the country,
<PB N="126" REF="025384_0125_0FCD10B2F719CA08">
and yet mannerly, and agreeably plea&s;ant with the great|e&s;t; and his family is a little pattern of virtue to all round them.</P>
<P>Ay, Madam, &s;ays the elde&s;t, it is &s;uch a gentleman my &s;i&s;ter would have. But, &s;ays her &s;i&s;ter, where are they to be found? I never expect it. Pray, Madam, &s;ays the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, in what part of the world does this black &s;wan, this unheard of, non-&s;uch thing of a gentleman live? I really forget the place, Madam, &s;ays the old lady, but it is &s;omewhere in Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>She perceived, at that word, both the young ladies change a little, and looked at one another; &s;o &s;he turn|ed her di&s;cour&s;e off to &s;ome other &s;ubject, and left them in the dark, as to the name of the gentleman; for &s;he perceived they both gue&s;&s;ed at it, or &s;u&s;pected it.</P>
<P>When they had taken their leave, and the two &s;i&s;ters were in the coach coming home, &s;ays the elder &s;i&s;ter to the other, did you ob&s;erve Mrs. B&mdash;'s &s;tory of the gentleman in Hamp&s;hire? Yes, &s;aid the other, I did; and I believe you fancy its the &s;ame per&s;on we know of. It is very true, &s;ays the elde&s;t, I did think &s;o, all the while &s;he was telling the &s;tory; and I expected &s;he would name him, but I was loth to a&s;k her his name. I am glad you didn't, &s;ays the other, for I know no good it can be to me to hear it, one way or other, now he is gone. Why, would not you be glad to know that he was really &s;uch a one as &s;he has de&s;cribed? &s;ays the elde&s;t. Yes, truly, for his own &s;ake I &s;hould, &s;aid the &s;i&s;ter; but it is no|thing to me now; I had rather never have him mention|ed at all to me, upon any occa&s;ion whatever.</P>
<P>After they were come home, their father, who had been engaged all the while, had &s;ent the coach back for them, with an excu&s;e for his not coming, was very in|qui&s;itive to know of them, what di&s;cour&s;e they had had; and, his elde&s;t daughter telling him one &s;tory and ano|ther &s;tory, he would cry, Well, was that all? For he expected &s;he had broke the thing to them. No, &s;ays the elde&s;t, &s;he told us a &s;trange &s;tory in Hamp&s;hire; and with that repeated the pa&s;&s;age word for word. Her fa|ther took no notice of it at that time, but two or three days after, as they were at &s;upper, he &s;ays to his elde&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="025384_0126_0FCD10B46654CE20">
daughter, Betty, who do you think the gentleman in Hamp&s;hire is, that Mrs. B&mdash;told you the &s;tory of? I cannot tell, &s;ays &s;he: pray who was it? even as I thought when you told me of it, &s;aid the father, for I had heard &s;omething of it before; it is nobody el&s;e but Mr.&mdash;, the &s;ame your wi&s;e &s;i&s;ter there thought fit to treat with &s;o much ill manners.</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, &s;ays the elde&s;t, do not &s;ay my &s;i&s;ter treated him with ill manners; for he owns the contrary to that him&s;elf: but how are you &s;ure of it, Sir, that it is he? Why, I have had the &s;tory, &s;ays her father, from her hu&s;band, who is greatly affected at it, and he named his name to me, not knowing in the lea&s;t that I know any thing of him.</P>
<P>Truly, &s;aid the elde&s;t, I am very glad of it for his &s;ake; but it does not &s;ignify a farthing to her now; for, if he was to come to her again to-morrow, with all his &s;obriety and reformation about him, &s;he would have no|thing to &s;ay to him.</P>
<P>Why &s;o, child, &s;ays the father, did you not own &s;he loved him? Yes, &s;ays the daughter, before the came to know what a creature he was. Well then, &s;ays the fa|ther, if that be removed, and he is become another man, &s;he will love him again; and &s;he had no other objection again&s;t him, had &s;he? No, Sir, &s;ays the daughter, &s;he had no other objection; but &s;he will never believe him, let his pretences to religion be what they will. Why &s;o? &s;ays the father. Becau&s;e, Sir, he told her, that if he had known her mind, he would have pretended to a world of reformation and religion, and that he did not doubt but he could be hypocrite enough to cheat her.</P>
<P>Nay, if he has been &s;o fooli&s;h, I know not what to &s;ay to it, &s;ays the father: let it re&s;t as it is; if &s;he will not have him, whether he be religious or not religious, then the objection of his not being religious, was a &s;ham and a cloak, and &s;he &s;tands out in mere ob&s;tinacy again&s;t her own intere&s;t, purely to affront her father; let her go on, till &s;he comes to be convinced by her own misfortune; I'll meddle no more about it.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter failed not to relate this &s;tory very par|ticularly to her &s;i&s;ter; who, very gravely mu&s;ing on the
<PB N="128" REF="025384_0127_0FCD10B66A18F658">
particular, an&s;wered her &s;i&s;ter thus, after &s;everal other &s;ober and religious expre&s;&s;ions:</P>
<P>Dear &s;i&s;ter, &s;ays &s;he, this thing has been affliction e|nough to me; but my father's conduct has always made it double; becau&s;e he cannot talk of it without re&s;ent|ment and unkindne&s;s; if it be really &s;o, that this is the gentleman Mrs.&mdash;told us the &s;tory of ye&s;terday, I &s;hould rejoice; nay, though I am loth to be cheated, and what he &s;aid of playing the hypocrite with me, has made me the more backward to give credit to out&s;ides; yet, were I &s;ure it was a real work of God in him, and that he was become a religious gentleman, you know I have affection enough to rejoice on my own account, and to entertain him after another manner than before: but yet two things make it &s;till remote from me, Fir&s;t, That I have no demon&s;tration of the truth of the fact: and, Secondly, That, if it is &s;o, he has made no &s;tep towards me, and perhaps never may; and you know, &s;i&s;ter, con|tinued &s;he, it is no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine, till he does.</P>
<P>Why, that's true, &s;ays the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter; but, what mu&s;t be done then?</P>
<P>Done! &s;ays &s;he, let it alone; let it re&s;t, till we heat &s;omething or other of it in the ordinary way of &s;uch things.</P>
<P>But what mu&s;t we do with my father? &s;ays the elde&s;t, for he is always talking to me about it.</P>
<P>Do! &s;ays the other, give the &s;ame an&s;wer to him from me as I do to you.</P>
<P>Then, &s;ays the elde&s;t, I am &s;ure he never will re&s;t, till he brings it about again; for he is &s;trangely intere&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>Let that be as plea&s;es God, I will be wholly neuter, &s;ays the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Some time after this di&s;cour&s;e, the father having &s;ome occa&s;ion for his health, went down to the bath, and tak|ing all his daughters with him, he continued there &s;ome months; in which time they contracted an acquaintance with a lady and her two daughters, who came thither from Hamp&s;hire. The old lady had been a widow of a gentleman of quality, by whom &s;he had two daughters, but was married to an eminent clergyman in the country

<P>It happened one day after dinner, talking freely toge|ther about marrying religious hu&s;bands and wives; the elde&s;t daughter, as what is always much upon the mind, will be in proportion much upon the tongue, in&s;i&s;ted in di&s;cour&s;e upon the mi&s;ery of unequal matches, and how unhappy it was, either to hu&s;band or wife, when a reli|gious, pious, &s;incere Chri&s;tian, whether man or woman, was married to another, who had no &s;en&s;e of religion; and &s;he gives a long account of a relation of her father's, but without naming their aunt, how good a hu&s;band &s;he had in all other re&s;pects, how comfortably and plea&s;antly they lived, but only for that one thing: and then &s;he told them (&s;till without naming any body) how many odd trick Sir James &s;erved his lady, and the like.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, &s;ays the old clergyman, I can tell you &s;uch a &s;tory of a lady in your country, as I believe you ne|ver heard the like. I do not know the woman, &s;ays the doctor, but I know the gentleman intimately well, and have had a great deal of religious conver&s;ation with him, upon the occa&s;ion I &s;hall tell you of.</P>
<P>He courted a young lady, &s;ays the doctor, but, whe|ther &s;he lived in our country or the city, or where, he is perfectly mute, only that he often tells her Chri&s;tian name; and &s;eeing he &s;eems re&s;olved to conceal her per|&s;on, no body will be &s;o rude to pre&s;s him on that head.</P>
<P>The gentleman, &s;ays the doctor, is of a very good fami|ly, has a noble e&s;tate, a comely per&s;on, and a complete courtly education, and till this happened, was almo&s;t al|ways at London.</P>
<P>His mi&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t be little le&s;s than an angel in human &s;hape, by his di&s;cription; but that we give no heed to; for, Madam, &s;ays the old doctor, you know, men in love give them&s;elves a liberty that way: but, however, after all things were agreed, and the writings drawing, it &s;eems &s;he threw him off entirely, and refu&s;ed him merely be|cau&s;e the found he was a man of no religion.</P>
<P>Says the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, how could &s;he know that, Sir? he was not &s;o fooli&s;h to tell her &s;o him&s;elf, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ays the doctor, he did: why then, &s;ays the &s;i&s;t|er,
<PB N="130" REF="025384_0129_0FCD10BC2FB685F8">
I &s;uppo&s;e he was indifferent whether he had her or no. Indeed, &s;ays the doctor, one would think &s;o, and I &s;aid &s;o to him: but he told me, that it was &s;o far from that, that he had taken up his re&s;olution never to have any other woman, if &s;he were the riche&s;t, be&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful creature alive.</P>
<P>Then, perhaps, the lady has a &s;uperior fortune to him, be&s;ides her other qualifications, &s;ays the &s;i&s;ter. No, ju&s;t the contrary, &s;ays the doctor. But, Madam, &s;ays he, I'll tell you the hi&s;tory of this gentleman, if it is not too long for you; it is a &s;tory that cannot be unprofitable to any one to hear, e&s;pecially to you, ladies, who have taken up &s;uch happy re&s;olutions about marrying none but religious hu&s;bands. The ladies bowed, in token they de&s;ired him to go on with the &s;tory. So the doctor went on.</P>
<P>Nothing touched this gentleman &s;o near, &s;ays he, af|ter he was gone from his mi&s;tre&s;s, as to reflect what kind of a wretch or mon&s;ter he was, that a virtuous young lady, and one who he had rea&s;on to believe had no di&s;|like of him, &s;hould be afraid to marry him for fear of being ruined, and that &s;he &s;hould think, if &s;he took him, &s;he declared war again&s;t heaven, and renounced all pre|ten&s;ions of duty to her Maker.&mdash;[Here he related the whole &s;tory, his talk with him&s;elf, the di&s;cour&s;e at the chocolate-hou&s;e, his retreat into the country, his hap|pening to hear the poor countryman at prayer, his con|ver&s;ation with him upon the way, and his conduct after|ward, all in the manner as related before.]</P>
<P>We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the &s;i&s;ters to have much le&s;s &s;en&s;e of religion than they were known to have, and particularly le&s;s &s;en&s;e of the ca&s;e it&s;elf, in which it was ea&s;y to know they were nearly concerned, if they were not very much moved with the particulars of this &s;tory; and no &s;ooner had the doctor fini&s;hed his relation, with &s;ome very hand|&s;ome reflections upon it, but the &s;i&s;ters longed to with|draw, to compare their own thoughts together, where they could do it with freedom.</P>
<P>But the elde&s;t daughter went farther; for though per|haps her curio&s;ity was not greater than her &s;i&s;ter's, yet, as her courage was greater, and her concerns in it le&s;s,

&s;he was re&s;olved to get the name of this gentleman, if po&s;&s;ible; accordingly, at length, &s;he a&s;ked the doctor, if the name of this gentleman was a &s;ecret; No, Madam, &s;ays the doctor, his name is no &s;ecret; it is Mr.&mdash;the elde&s;t &s;on of Sir Thomas&mdash;, by whom he enjoys an e&s;tate of 2000l. a-year, and after his uncle, who is ve|ry old, he has near a thou&s;and pounds a-year more en|tailed upon him.</P>
<P>The two &s;i&s;ters had heard too much to continue any longer; the younge&s;t e&s;pecially, who pretending &s;ome indi&s;po&s;ition, withdrew, and her &s;i&s;ter &s;oon after: when her &s;i&s;ter came to her, &s;he &s;aid, well, child, what do you &s;ay to this &s;tory? there's no room to think there can be any de&s;ign in this old gentleman, or any hypocri&s;y in the particulars if they are true.</P>
<P>Her &s;i&s;ter &s;aid never a word; but &s;he found &s;he had been crying, and that &s;he was &s;till too full of it to &s;peak; &s;o &s;he let her alone a while, till, after &s;ome time fetch|ing a great &s;igh, which gave her pa&s;&s;ions &s;ome vent, &s;ays the younge&s;t, Why, what do you &s;ay to it? I &s;ay to it! &s;ays the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, I can &s;ay neither le&s;s or more to it than what the two di&s;ciples &s;aid to one another, going to Emmaus, about our Saviour's di&s;cour&s;e to them, after he was gone, did not our hearts burn within us when he talked to us? I am &s;ure mine did, &s;ays &s;he; ay, and mine too, &s;ays the younge&s;t. But it is all nothing to me now. Nay, &s;ays the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, if all the &s;tory be true, it may be &s;omething to you &s;till; for you &s;ee, the doctor &s;ays, he is re&s;olved to have nobody el&s;e. I give no heed to that, &s;ays the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, for the tables are quite turned now between us, and he ought to refu&s;e me now, for the very rea&s;on that I refu&s;ed him before; for I have no religion for &s;uch a convert as this, I am &s;ure, any more than a man without any notion of a deity, had re|ligion enough for me. Well, well, &s;ays her &s;i&s;ter, let Providence, which brings all things to pa&s;s its own way, work as he &s;ees fit; I dare &s;ay, as my aunt &s;aid, we &s;hall hear more of it.</P>
<P>They had very little di&s;cour&s;e at that time but what ended thus; but the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter had a great mind her father &s;hould hear the &s;tory too, if po&s;&s;ible, before they

left the place; and &s;he re&s;olved to take an opportunity to bring it about, if &s;he could; but &s;he was happily pre|vented by the forwardne&s;s of her father to complain of his daughter's nice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y on all occa&s;ions: for, in di&s;cour&s;e with the doctor and his lady, the young ladies on both &s;ides being ab&s;ent, he took a liberty to exclaim vehement|ly how fooli&s;h one of his daughters had been, and how &s;he had ob&s;tinately ca&s;t off a gentleman of &s;uch and &s;uch qualifications, as before. My dear, &s;ays the doctor's la|dy to him, pray tell Mr.&mdash;the &s;tory you told the la|dies ye&s;terday: With all my heart, &s;aid the doctor; &s;o he repeated the whole &s;tory.</P>
<P>The father was exceedingly &s;urprized at the particu|lars, but more when the doctor told him the name of the gentleman. However, he held his tongue, as it happen|ed, and did not let the doctor know how near it related to his family; but in the evening, taking his opportuni|ty, he calls his elde&s;t daughter to him. Hark ye, Bet|ty, &s;ays he, did the doctor tell you a &s;tory t'other day of a gentleman in Hamp&s;hire? Yes, Sir, &s;ays &s;he. And was your &s;i&s;ter by? &s;ays he. Yes, Sir, &s;ays &s;he. And do you know that this is the &s;ame Mr.&mdash;that we know of? &s;ays her father. Yes, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, he told us his name: Well, and what does your &s;i&s;ter &s;ay to it? &s;ays he. She &s;ays little, Sir, &s;ays his daughter; but &s;he cannot but be moved at it; for 'tis a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tory. I dare &s;ay, &s;ays her father, I &s;hall hear of him again; &s;he won't turn him off again, I hope; I am &s;ure &s;he does not de&s;erve him now. She &s;ays &s;o her&s;elf, &s;ays the daugh|ter, That he ought to refu&s;e her now, for the &s;ame rea|&s;on that &s;he refu&s;ed him. Well, &s;ays the father, we &s;hall certainly hear of him again; I am fully per&s;uaded, he will have no re&s;t till he comes to &s;ee her again.</P>
<P>A few weeks after this they returned to London, and the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter being impatient to &s;ee her aunt, and to give her &s;ome account of the&s;e things, they went both a|way to Hamp&s;tead: when they came thither, &s;he failed not to give her aunt a particular account of all the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages, as well that which had happened at their vi&s;it to the merchant's lady at London, as what had happened at the bath; all which, but e&s;pecially the la&s;t, were won|derfully

&s;urpri&s;ing and agreeable to their aunt. Well, niece, &s;ays the aunt to the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, what do you think of the&s;e things? I can &s;ay little to them, Madam, &s;ays &s;he; I am glad, for his &s;ake, that God opened his eyes.

I have been none of the in&s;trument, not I. Yes, yes, replies her aunt, you have, and he acknowledges it too: and turning to the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, &s;ays &s;he, I think, child, now you may perform your promi&s;e, and tell your &s;i&s;ter what he &s;aid to you when he called here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s he went out of town. Yes, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, &s;o I think too. [Here &s;he gives her &s;i&s;ter a full account of what he had &s;aid, as before.]</P>
<P>I think you might have told me this before, &s;ays the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter. Nay, &s;i&s;ter, replied &s;he, did you not take me &s;hort, and forbid me telling you any thing, and with|drew out of the room, and bid me tell it my aunt? Why, that's true, I did &s;o, &s;ays &s;he again, and I have been &s;o confu&s;ed, that I know not when I do well, and when I do ill: indeed, niece, &s;ays her aunt, I al&s;o obliged her not to tell you; for I concluded, if there was any thing in it, we &s;hould hear of it again: and if we did not, it could do you no &s;ervice.</P>
<P>While they were talking thus, a coach &s;topt at the door, and a &s;ervant brought word, their father and another gentleman with him was below &s;tairs.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary here to leave this part a while, and bring forward the &s;tory of the young gentleman as far as it is needful to the co-herence of things; the &s;tory al&s;o will be very &s;hort.</P>
<P>The young gentleman having, as has been &s;aid, taken his new tutor, the poor countryman, into the hou&s;e with him, received &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his advice, and had daily &s;uch in&s;truction in religious things, from the whole|&s;ome plain coun&s;els of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, poor creature, that the benefit of them &s;oon appeared in his conver&s;ation, and his reformation &s;oon became vi&s;ible in the general cour&s;e of his life; he kept company with the &s;obere&s;t, grave&s;t, and mo&s;t religious per&s;ons that he could find; he kept a mo&s;t &s;ober, regular, reformed family; and, &s;eem|ing
<PB N="134" REF="025384_0133_0FCD10C26E8B5FF0">
to re&s;olve to re&s;ide pretty much there, for the better government of his family, he took in a young mini&s;ter of an extraordinary good character to be his chaplain, and cau&s;ed every &s;ervant who appeared di&s;orderly or vicious to be put away out of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the natural con&s;equences of a &s;incere work upon his own mind, were the vi&s;ible product of that ble&s;|&s;ed change, and indeed an agreeable evidence of the &s;in|cerity of it; but they were far from being the &s;um of things; for, in a word, he proved to be a mo&s;t pious, &s;incere Chri&s;tian in all his ways; and as this was attend|ed with a natural &s;weetne&s;s in his di&s;po&s;ition, mode&s;ty and genero&s;ity in his manner, and an excellent temper, free from all manner of pride or hypocri&s;y, it made him perfectly agreeable to all &s;orts of people; tho&s;e who were not like him valued and honoured him, and the &s;ober, religious part of men were delighted in him beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He went on thus for near two years, lived generally in the country; e&s;pecially, becau&s;e he could not be long from his faithful a&s;&s;i&s;tant, the poor clergyman, who was upon all occa&s;ions, as we may &s;ay, clerk of the clo&s;et to him, and with whom he kept up a mo&s;t religious, but &s;e|cret conver&s;ation, and had retirements with him, which none were acquainted with but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But in all this enjoyment of him&s;elf, and the retired life he had now placed his delight in, he found &s;omething &s;till wanting too, as well to complete his happine&s;s here, as to forward his progre&s;s in things of an eternal and du|rable nature; and he began to &s;ay to him&s;elf, that he had robbed him&s;elf of much of his comfort, in neglecting &s;o long to have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that ble&s;&s;ed creature whom God had made the fir&s;t in&s;trument to touch his mind with a &s;en&s;e of good things.</P>
<P>The&s;e thoughts dwelt upon his heart a good while, and he found him&s;elf very unea&s;y: it occurred to him, that certainly, as it had plea&s;ed God to make that young woman to give him the alarm, and &s;trike his &s;oul with the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e of his wretched condition, he had certainly furni&s;hed her for his farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and made her ca|pable of giving him further help, light, and directions in
<PB N="135" REF="025384_0134_0FCD10C3641C1848">
his duty; and that he &s;tood in the way of his own com|forts all the while he was without her; nay, that he &s;eemed to reject the in&s;trument by which God had done him &s;o much good, without inquiring whether God had de&s;igned her for his farther benefit or no.</P>
<P>He reflected, how &s;uitable a di&s;po&s;ition &s;he was of in religious things, to the de&s;ign he had of keeping up a re|ligious family, and how admirable a wife, a mother, a mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;uch a lady mu&s;t needs be to him, and his whole hou&s;e; who now &s;aw the truth of the excellent &s;entence &s;he had often repeated to him, viz. That a religious life was &s;he only heaven upon earth. He di&s;cour&s;ed all the&s;e things with his faithful coun&s;ellor, poor William, who per&s;uaded him by all the per&s;ua&s;ious he could u&s;e, to go and make her his own; for it was the only fear, William &s;aid he had for him, that he would marry &s;ome lady, who, having been brought up in the u&s;ual levity of the times, would pull him backward, rather than forward him in his religious re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>With the&s;e thoughts he re&s;olved to go to London, and apply him&s;elf immediately to his former mi&s;tre&s;s, and ob|tain her for his own, if po&s;&s;ible; but was exceedingly di&s;appointed, when he found &s;he and her father, and all the family, were gone to the Bath.</P>
<P>However he waited, and hearing of her return, he went immediately to make his vi&s;it, without any cere|mony: when he found &s;he was abroad, he fell to worn &s;eriou&s;ly with her father; he told him, that the la&s;t time he was there, he had indeed promi&s;ed to wait on her a|gain, notwith&s;tanding what had pa&s;&s;ed. Her father told him, he had received an account how his daughter had us'd him; that he was in the country when it happened, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould have concerned him&s;elf to have &s;ecur|ed him better treatment; that he had re&s;ented it &s;o al|ready to his daughter, that he had &s;carce been in &s;peaking terms with her &s;ince; that, as to his promi&s;e of coming again, he believed &s;he was convinced that &s;he had no rea|&s;on to expect it, &s;eeing no gentleman would care to be ill u&s;ed twice upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion. The young gentle|man an&s;wered, that he was very &s;orry he &s;hould re&s;ent any thing from his daughter on his account; that he was
<PB N="136" REF="025384_0135_0FCD10C4E3C3CAD0">
&s;urprized to hear him &s;ay, &s;he had ill us'd him; that, up|on his word, &s;he had not &s;aid or done the lea&s;t unbecom|ing thing to him; that he was even then, when &s;he did it, fully convinced of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of what &s;he had &s;aid, and ten times as much, if that were po&s;&s;ible; and al&s;o of the ju&s;t motives &s;he had to &s;ay it to him: that if &s;he had done le&s;s, &s;he would have acted from meaner prin|ciples than he knew &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of; and that her rea&s;ons were &s;o good, and &s;he &s;o well maintained them, that he had neither then, nor now, the lea&s;t thing to offer again&s;t them; and that his bu&s;ine&s;s was not now to an|&s;wer her arguments, but to &s;ee if he could comply better with the ju&s;t demands that &s;he then made, than he could before.</P>
<P>The father an&s;wered with a great many compliments and excu&s;es, and &s;uch like di&s;cour&s;es; but the gentleman found that he neither reli&s;hed the rea&s;on of his daughter's refu&s;al, or was affected at all with all he could &s;ay to con|vince him how he had taken it; and mode&s;ty forbidding him to go farther in any declaration about religious mat|ters, e&s;pecially where he found there was no ta&s;te of it, he declined &s;aying any more about it; but he turn'd his di&s;|cour&s;e to de&s;iring another interview with his daughter upon the terms of former propo&s;als; which the father con|&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to, they went together in the young gentleman's chariot to Hamp&s;tead, where the young ladies were; and this was the gentleman, who, as I ob&s;erved, was come to the door with their father, ju&s;t as they were about talk|ing of him with their aunt.</P>
<P>I had given an account before, that they heard a coach &s;top at the gate, and that a &s;ervant brought up word, that their father and another gentleman was below &s;tairs; but they were &s;urpri&s;ed, you may be &s;ure, when the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter going down fir&s;t, comes running up &s;tairs again, with the news, in &s;hort, that it was Mr.&mdash;, and that their father had brought him.</P>
<P>The aunt, unwilling her niece &s;hould appear in any di&s;order, &s;ays to her, Come, child, you two &s;hall &s;tay a little, and let me go down fir&s;t; which the younger &s;i&s;ter was very glad of. It was ea&s;y to perceive, and the pa&s;&s;ages already related will allow us to &s;uppo&s;e, that al|though
<PB N="137" REF="025384_0136_0FCD10C9617AC148">
it was &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e to the young lady to have him come thus &s;uddenly and abruptly upon her, having not prepared her thoughts, or re&s;olved upon what reception to give him, and not having the lea&s;t intimation from her father upon what account he came, yet that &s;he was not alarmed as &s;he u&s;ed to be; the &s;cruples of her con&s;cience were all an&s;wered; her jealou&s;ies of his hypocri&s;y were over, and her affection had little or nothing to &s;truggle with now, unle&s;s &s;he might doubt his re&s;entment of things pa&s;t, and whether he came upon the old account, or ra|ther to perform his promi&s;e, and make a vi&s;it of ceremony only; however, &s;he begg'd her &s;i&s;ter to &s;peak to her aunt, that they might &s;tay at her hou&s;e, and that &s;he might re|ceive his vi&s;its there, becau&s;e then &s;he would have her aunt to advi&s;e and con&s;ult with, on every occa&s;ion, and then &s;he would put off their being left together that night, that &s;he might con&s;ider things a little, and know the better how to receive him.</P>
<P>Her &s;i&s;ter went down, and &s;ending for her aunt into another room, propo&s;ed the fir&s;t to her; let me alone, niece, for that, &s;ays &s;he. So the other went up to her &s;i&s;ter, and &s;oon after the father calling for his two daugh|ters, they went down into the room. It was ea&s;y for her, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to perceive, that her lover was not at all altered in his affection to her; that he did not come to her with re&s;entment, or with ceremony; for he flew to her, took her in his arms, and told her, he came to &s;ee if &s;he had goodne&s;s enough to pardon his not keep|ing his word with her, in coming to wait on her again, and al&s;o to claim her promi&s;e of &s;taying for him. He &s;poke this &s;o &s;oftly, as not to be heard by the company, and without expecting any an&s;wer, turned about to pay his re&s;pects to her aunt; in doing which, he told her, he hoped &s;he would give him leave to wait upon her niece at her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The aunt took the hint, and turning to the father, Brother, &s;ays &s;he to him privately, I think if you would let my niece &s;tay here for &s;ome time, and let the gentle|man come to wait on her here, I would take care to pre|vent &s;uch little &s;cruples as you know interrupted that affair before, and you will &s;he &s;ooner bring it to an end
<PB N="138" REF="025384_0137_0FCD10CA6AEEFF50">
according to your mind. With all my heart, &s;ays the fa|ther; if we had done &s;o before, I believe &s;he had not play'd the fool as &s;he did.</P>
<P>Upon this, turning them&s;elves to the company, &s;he &s;ays aloud, Niece, I don't intend to lo&s;e your company thus; I &s;uppo&s;e, if this gentleman de&s;igns to vi&s;it you, he won't think it a great way to come to Hamp&s;tead, which, now the roads are &s;o good, is not above an hour's driving; and, I hope, we &s;hall not make his entertainment &s;o ill, as to make him weary of his coming hither. Her niece &s;aid, that mu&s;t be as her father plea&s;ed to direct; I know that, &s;aid her aunt; and therefore I have got your father's con&s;ent already. They bowed both to her in token of a&s;&s;ent, and night coming on, her father talk'd of going away; &s;o he told her, he would take another opportunity to wait on her, which was what &s;he had de&s;ired. And thus ended their fir&s;t meeting.</P>
<P>They had &s;carce dined the next day, but, as he had &s;aid, he came to vi&s;it her, and they had the whole after|noon to them&s;elves; and, from that day, they began to under&s;tand one another &s;o well, that, in a few weeks, matters began to draw to a clo&s;e. But, becau&s;e &s;ome part of their di&s;cour&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to fini&s;h the former ac|count, and may be as u&s;eful as it is entertaining, I &s;hall fir&s;t give &s;ome of the particulars, as they occurred in di&s;cour&s;e between her and her aunt and &s;i&s;ter, upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As &s;he had advi&s;ed with her &s;i&s;ter and aunt upon every particular, and e&s;pecially with her &s;i&s;ter, from the fir&s;t of it; &s;o &s;he made no &s;cruple to give them a full account of things as they pa&s;&s;ed. It was one morning, after the gentleman had been above a week in his new addre&s;&s;es, that, coming into her aunt's dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;he found her &s;i&s;ter there drinking coffee with her aunt; and her &s;i&s;ter began with her thus:</P>

<P>Well, &s;i&s;ter, you u&s;ed to be free with a bo|dy, and tell one now and then how things went with you; now we hear nothing from you; what, is it all to be a &s;ecret?</P>

<P>Nay, niece, you ought not to pre&s;s your &s;i&s;ter to give an account of &s;uch things.</P>

<P>When &s;he wanted advice, Madam, &s;he was open enough.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I wi&s;h her as well as I do my own children; but I cannot de&s;ire her to give an account of &s;uch things, unle&s;s &s;he wants advice in any thing; and then &s;he's a judge of that.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, if I have not told any thing or every thing, both to you and my &s;i&s;ter, it has not been by way of re&s;erve; I am ready to give a full account of all you de&s;ire; for there is nothing pa&s;&s;es between us that need be concealed from you that are &s;o near to me. As for my &s;i&s;ter, I told her every pa&s;&s;age before; and as for you, Madam, did I not de&s;ire to be here, that I might con&s;ult and advi&s;e with you, and have your directions in every &s;tep? and I have wondered you never a&s;ked about it before.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I never &s;aid he was a hypocrite: if he had been no hone&s;ter, than he was polite, I had been ef|fectually deceived; for it was too true, as he &s;aid, if he had talk'd a little religiou&s;ly, nay, if he had not openly profe&s;s'd his contempt of all religion, he had cheated me, and had never made any objection.</P>

<P>Why, then I think my &s;i&s;ter is mad: what kind of confe&s;&s;ion of principles do you in&s;i&s;t on, pray? I hope you don't &s;et up to examine the heart.</P>

<P>You run all upon mi&s;takes with me, &s;i&s;ter; the di&s;pute lies ju&s;t the other way; I am for allowing him to be &s;incere, but he will not grant that I have any rea&s;on to do &s;o: he &s;ays, that I ought to be believe he is a hypocrite.</P>

<P>With all my heart, Madam: you know he came to me la&s;t Tue&s;day night, when you fir&s;t left us to|gether. After &s;ome compliments, he repeated what he had &s;aid before, that he came to a&s;k my pardon for not coming again: I told him, I did not expect him to come again, and, if I was to believe the opinion of other peo|ple, I had u&s;ed him &s;o rudely, that it was not rea&s;onable to think, that any gentleman that was &s;o treated, would ever have come again, unle&s;s it was to affront me. He wondered, he &s;aid, who could pretend to &s;ay &s;o; for he a&s;&s;ured me, he not only never &s;aid I u&s;ed him ill, but ne|ver thought &s;o, and certainly I would not &s;ay &s;o to any body; for he was per&s;uaded, he &s;aid, that I did neither do it on purpo&s;e to u&s;e him ill, or believe it was ill u&s;age. I told him he did me a deal of ju&s;tice to &s;ay, I did not act on purpo&s;e to affront him; but that I could not but &s;ay, I thought I had u&s;ed him a little rudely, for all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and that if he thought &s;o too, I was very ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this opportunity to a&s;k his pardon, without &s;o much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aming the nece&s;&s;ity I was in, on other accounts for do|ing what I did.</P>

<P>You were very courtly in that particular, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pray, what did he &s;ay to it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>He told me, I had nothing to a&s;k him par|don for; and a&s;&s;ured me, he had not been gone half an
<PB N="141" REF="025384_0140_0FCD10CEA4981A60">
hour from he before he was convinced of the ju&s;tice of all I had &s;aid, and how much rea&s;on I had to refu&s;e him, upon the nicety which I had refu&s;ed him upon. He ad|ded, that he had a thou&s;and times &s;ince reproached him|&s;elf with the folly of his own conduct at that time, or that he could think it would recommend him to any wo|man of virtue and &s;en&s;e, to boa&s;t of having no thought or &s;en&s;e of religion: for, Madam, &s;ays he, had you taken no notice of it, I &s;hould of nece&s;&s;ity have concluded in a quarter of an hour after, that you had no &s;en&s;e of virtue or religion your&s;elf. Why, what if I had not? &s;aid I; I had been but the more &s;uitable to you, and you mu&s;t have liked me the better for that. He returned, no, Madam, ju&s;t the contrary; for, though I own I had not thought of religion my&s;elf, yet if any woman had told me &s;o of her&s;elf, I &s;hould pre&s;ently have &s;aid, &s;he was no match for a gentleman; for no man can be &s;o void of &s;en&s;e, as well as of religion, as not to know, that a woman of no reli|gion is no woman fit to make a wife of: and this, &s;ays he, convinced me, that you were in the right to refu&s;e me on that account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a very ingenuous acknowledgement, I confe&s;s; the truth of it is &s;o convincing, that I wi&s;h all the young woman, who have their &s;ettlements in view, would reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on this point, That, however wick|ed men are, they are always willing to have &s;ober, reli|gious, and virtuous wives; and 'tis very rarely, that the wor&s;t rake in nature, if his &s;en&s;es are in exerci&s;e, de|&s;ires to have a wife loo&s;e like him&s;elf;&mdash;but pray go on, niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>He told me, he was not gone a quarter of an hour from me, but this reflection &s;truck with horror upon his mind: what a dreadful creature am I? Sure I am a horrid, frightful wretch! that a woman of &s;obriety and religion was afraid to venture to take me, for fear of be|ing ruined; and that &s;he &s;hould think &s;he declared war again&s;t Heaven, and joined her&s;elf to one of God's ene|mies! He was going on, but I found his &s;peech &s;top|ped of a &s;udden; at which I was a little &s;urprized, and a&s;ked him, if he was not well? He &s;aid, Yes; and en|deavoured to hide the little di&s;order he was in, and went
<PB N="142" REF="025384_0141_0FCD10D4D87C7A78">
on. He then told me, that I had been really very ju&s;t to him, and he had rea&s;on to thank me for it; and that he had de&s;ired my &s;i&s;ter to expre&s;s his mind fully on that ac|count; which he hoped &s;he had done. I told him, I could not now enter upon an apology for what I had &s;aid to him &s;o long ago; that, if I had treated him rudely, or &s;everely, I was very &s;orry; but that what I did was occa&s;ioned, as he knew very well, by his making &s;uch open declarations, and &s;uch as I thought he really had no occa&s;ion for, concerning his aver&s;ion to, and ignorance of all religion; and that it was really a dreadful thing to think of marrying upon &s;uch terms. He replied, that if I had &s;aid le&s;s than I did, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, when he came to his &s;en&s;es, have had a meaner opinion of me than he had; and that it was really the reproaches that I had given him, and the excellent rea&s;ons I had given him for my re&s;olutions of rejecting him, that had now brought him back to me, and had made him re&s;olve to have no woman upon earth but me, if I would but revoke the re&s;olution I had taken again&s;t him; for nothing le&s;s, than &s;o much religion and virtue, could ever make him happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he was &s;incere in this, I a&s;&s;ure you niece, it was a high compliment upon religion, as well as upon your conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him, that, as the rea&s;on I had for u&s;ing him &s;o, was thus approved by him&s;elf, he bound me to pre&s;erve the &s;ame re&s;olution, on the hazard of his having a le&s;s e&s;teem for me. He confe&s;s'd that was very true; unle&s;s he could convince me the cau&s;e was removed; which he &s;aw no hopes of: and that was the rea&s;on that he came to vi&s;it me again, with &s;o little encouragement, that he knew not what to think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he mean by that? why, &s;ure, then all we have heard mu&s;t be fal&s;e, and he is the &s;ame man as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was greatly &s;tartled at his words, and look|ed &s;teadily at him, but could judge nothing from his countenance: but it grew late, and he took his leave, falling in with &s;ome other cur&s;ory talk, and left me, I con|fe&s;s, in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion of thoughts imaginable
<PB N="143" REF="025384_0142_0FCD10D6330B2F38">
for I was dreadfully afraid he would declare him&s;elf to have no &s;en&s;e of religion on his mind &s;till; and then I was in a wor&s;e condition than at fir&s;t, having thus admit|ted a &s;econd treaty with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought, child, you were a little perplex'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Tue&s;day night, but I took it to be only a little thought|fulne&s;s more than ordinary, which is u&s;ual on &s;uch occa|&s;ions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>When he came again the next night, he made a kind of an apology for having left me in more di&s;order than he us'd to do: For, to tell you true, Madam, &s;ays he, I was not able to go on with what I was &s;aying to you, neither am I now, &s;ays he, &s;eeing I am come to wait on you, and yet have effectually &s;hut the door again&s;t my|&s;elf. I told him, I did not perhaps rightly under&s;tand him, unle&s;s he would explain him&s;elf: why, &s;ays he, I have fir&s;t told you &s;incerely, how ab&s;olutely I approve of the re&s;olution you took again&s;t me, and yet own'd and do &s;till, that I am no way able to convince you that the cau&s;e is removed. I told him, that I thought he was not ju&s;t to him&s;elf; and that the &s;ame thing whatever it was, that had power to convince him that I was under a nece&s;&s;ity to refu&s;e him on that occa&s;ion, would certainly a&s;&s;i&s;t him to remove the cau&s;e. He turn'd &s;hort upon me. But, Ma|dam, &s;ays he, did not I make conditions with you, that whenever I talk'd of it, you &s;hould take me for a hypo|crite? and did I not declare po&s;itively to you, that I would deceive you, if I could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I know what he meant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, &s;o did I too; but he run it up &s;o high again&s;t him&s;elf, that I could not an&s;wer a word, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">le&s;s I would have turn'd the tables, as it were, again&s;t my&s;elf, and courted him, by telling him how well I was &s;atisfied of his &s;incerity; &s;o that, in &s;hort, I was quite puzzled: for what could I &s;ay to a man that did, as it were, bid me believe him to be an hypocrite?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had a nice ca&s;e before you, cou&s;in; pray what &s;aid you to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him very coldly, I was under a nece&s;|&s;ity of believing every thing he &s;aid, becau&s;e he had been &s;o &s;incere with me all along; and I begg'd him therefore
<PB N="144" REF="025384_0143_0FCD10D7A6305A18">
not to tell me &s;eriou&s;ly now that he was a hypocrite; and that the cau&s;e of my refu&s;ing to talk with him before was not removed; that I hoped it was otherwi&s;e, but &s;hould de&s;pair of it, if it came from his own mouth; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if I were a&s;&s;ured from his own mouth, that he came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me, he mu&s;t needs know I had nothing el&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but to act as I did before, which he had owned I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;on for. No, Madam, &s;ays he, I do not &s;ay, I de&s;ire to deceive you; but, I &s;ay, that having told you I would, you ought to believe I de&s;ign it; and I &s;ee no room to convince you that I am not a hypocrite, &s;ee|ing I promi&s;ed you I would be &s;o; and know not whe|ther I dare tell you that I am not &s;o, even in the be&s;t of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could have put an end to all this nicety in two words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you will the more ea&s;ily tell me how I &s;hall do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I would have told him, that though I had not &s;o much concern for him to bu&s;y my&s;elf to inquire after his conduct, yet I had not &s;o little, as not to be glad to know, by other hands than his own, that he was no hypocri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and that I rejoiced for his &s;ake to hear that his eyes were opened to that which could alone make him the happie&s;t man alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time have told him, that my &s;cruples were all over about him; which was as much as to tell him I would have him whenever he plea&s;ed to take me; but I han't learn'd that way of talk|ing yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, niece, and if you had, after &s;o long ac|quaintance, and &s;o much pre&s;&s;ing, I do not think you could have charg'd your&s;elf with being forward.</P>

<P>Well then, you will the better like what has happen'd &s;ince, Madam.</P>

<P>Why, Madam, this took up the fir&s;t three or four nights of our di&s;cour&s;e; the night before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> began a little more &s;eriou&s;ly, and came clo&s;er to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it&s;elf: he told me, he had made him&s;elf very melancholy
<PB N="145" REF="025384_0144_0FCD10D985482C40">
with me, the two la&s;t times he was with me; for he thought, that in&s;tead of courting me to have him, he had taken a great deal of pains to court me to refu&s;e him a|gain. I told him, I thought &s;o too; and that I confe&s;s'd I had been a little concern'd about it, becau&s;e I could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no means under&s;tand him. He told me, it proceeded from the ju&s;t reflection he made on his fooli&s;h di&s;cour&s;e two years ago, viz. that he wi&s;h'd he had counterfeited religious di&s;cour&s;e, and he would certainly have cheated me if he could, and did not doubt but he could have done it effectually. Tho&s;e words, he &s;aid, flew in his face, when he went to &s;ay any thing &s;erious to me, and per&s;ua|ded him that I would believe he was only counterfeiting &s;erious things on purpo&s;e to deceive me. I an&s;wered, he might reproach him&s;elf with tho&s;e things, but I did not &s;ay any &s;tre&s;s on them; for I believed he had too much hone&s;ty, whether it proceeded from religion or no, to offer to deceive me in a thing, in which he own'd &s;o ingenuou&s;ly I was right. Then he told me, with the greate&s;t affection in his di&s;cour&s;e that ever I &s;aw in my life, that he mu&s;t confe&s;s, as he &s;aid before, that my re|jecting him, as I had done, had made impre&s;&s;ions on his mind, quite different from what he had before: but that he found it the harde&s;t thing in the world to expre&s;s what had happen'd to him on that account, and the thoughts of tho&s;e things which had taken up his mind &s;ince that; only this he would own to me, that I was in the right; that, he had mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly expo&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and that he had perfectly the &s;ame opinion now of tho&s;e things which I had before, viz. that a religious life was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon earth: but he could go no farther, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nor could he an&s;wer for him&s;elf, how far &s;uch thoughts might carry him, or expre&s;s to me the particulars that had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon his mind about them; and how far what he had &s;aid would &s;atisfy me, he did not know. I told him, I hoped he did not think I &s;et up for a judge of the particu|lars; that my objection before lay again&s;t a general con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">pt of all religion; that it was my terror to think of carrying an enemy to God, one that had no &s;en&s;e of the common duties we all owe to him that made us; but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pretended to expect a confe&s;&s;ion of faith from him,
<PB N="146" REF="025384_0145_0FCD10DD1CD7A6D8">
or any man, in &s;uch a ca&s;e. He told me, he thought it required more a&s;&s;urance than he was ma&s;ter of, to talk any thing of him&s;elf that way, at lea&s;t till there were more in|timacy between us; that he thought religious things (talk|ed of in that manner) received an injury from the very di&s;cour&s;e; and that it was next door to boa&s;ting of them, which was the wor&s;t kind of hypocri&s;y; and if he could &s;ay no more of him&s;elf but this, he hoped I would take it for a &s;ufficient te&s;timony of the alteration of his thoughts, viz. that he loved me for the honour I paid to religion, and for that &s;teadine&s;s which had made me refu&s;e him before. I told him, I &s;aw his difficulty, and that I would abate him of the trouble of entering into particulars, which I found he was too mode&s;t to relate, and which however I was not quite a &s;tranger to; and that I de&s;ired we might &s;peak no more of a thing which I knew it was difficult for him to be free in. He blu&s;hed as red as fire, when I &s;aid I was not a &s;tranger to the particulars, which he declined to expre&s;s, and &s;aid not one word for a good while. I told him, I knew it was a point that could not come ea&s;ily from a man's own mouth; that I did not de|&s;ire it, and would make him ea&s;y, &s;o far as to tell him, I was fully &s;atisfied he was no hypocrite, and hoped he would give him&s;elf no more trouble about it. He took me in his arms, and told me very affectionately, that I had &s;aid that of him, that he would give all the world to be able to &s;ay of him&s;elf; that however, he hoped to be be|holden to me for more than that; and as I had given him the fir&s;t view of the beauty of a religious life, he expect|ed a great deal more from my a&s;&s;i&s;tance and example in pur&s;uing the &s;teps of it. I told him, that I begged of him, we might avoid all religious compliments, for they were the odde&s;t things in nature; that he quite mi&s;took me; that it was not becau&s;e I thought my&s;elf capable of guid|ing in religious matters, that I in&s;i&s;ted on the nece&s;&s;ity of not marrying a man void of religion, but from a due &s;en&s;e of ju&s;t the contrary, viz. the want I &s;hould be in of be|ing guided and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in religious things upon all occa|&s;ions my&s;elf; that it would be a fatal mi&s;take the other way, and greatly to my di&s;advantage, to have him expect more from me than he would find; and that, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>This is the &s;um of our affair, and thus it &s;tands, only with this addition, that he told me a very plea&s;ant &s;tory which happened at a chocolate hou&s;e near the court, which is &s;o u&s;eful as well as diverting, that I cannot but relate it to you.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGIOUS COURTSHIP.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een the happy conduct of the younge&s;t of the three daughters of the gentleman, who&s;e family this book began with, and the comfortable &s;ucce&s;s of it. The &s;econd daughter, from the beginning, acted upon other principles, or rather, indeed, upon no princi|ples at all; yet her hi&s;tory may, perhaps, be no le&s;s fruit|ful of in&s;truction than the other, though &s;omething more tragical, as to her own part of it.</P>
<P>She had declared to her &s;i&s;ter, as appears in the begin|ning of her &s;tory, that &s;he would not trouble her&s;elf, when it came to her turn, what religion the gentleman was of, or whether he had any religion or no, if &s;he had but a good &s;ettlement; and now we &s;hall &s;ee her be as good as her word.</P>
<P>Her father, who&s;e character I have &s;ufficiently &s;poken to already, having had, for many years, a con&s;iderable trade into Italy, where he once lived, there came an Engli&s;h gentleman to vi&s;it him, who had been formerly contemporary with him, and long been his corre&s;pondent, or factor, there, viz. at Leghorn; and who, being grown very rich, was come to England, re&s;olving to &s;ettle here. There were &s;ome accompts, it &s;eems depending between them, which they had appointed a day to &s;ettle and balance, in order to exchange relea&s;es; which being all fini&s;hed in the morning, the father of the&s;e ladies takes his factor into his coach, and carries him home to dinner with him, where the old gentleman entertained him very hand&s;ome|ly, and where he had an opportunity to &s;ee the two maiden daughters; for the younge&s;t, who had been married &s;ome time, was gone into Hamp&s;hire to her country-&s;eat with her hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="025384_0148_0FCD10E16C53C740">
This Leghorn merchant no &s;ooner &s;aw and conver&s;ed a little with the ladies, but he took a fancy to the younge&s;t, and from that time re&s;olved to make her his wife. It was not long before he let them know his mind; and, having made very hand&s;ome propo&s;als to her father, he [the fa|ther] received him with a frankne&s;s &s;uitable to their long intimacy and acquaintance, and told him, With all his heart, if his daughter and he could agree.</P>
<P>Before I bring them together, it is proper to the reli&s;h of the &s;tory, to take a little notice of the characters of the two young per&s;ons, of who&s;e &s;tory we ought to have a ge|neral idea, that we may not be left to gather it up &s;lowly among the particulars.</P>
<P>The young lady was very &s;ober, virtuous to the nice&s;t degree, extremely well bred, and wonderfully good hu|moured. She was likewi&s;e a very lovely, beautiful per|&s;on, the hand&s;ome&s;t of the three &s;i&s;ters beyond all com|pari&s;on. As to religion, &s;he had a very good foundation of knowledge, and had done nothing to make it be &s;up|po&s;ed &s;he was not truly religious in practice; but &s;he was not altogether &s;o grave and &s;erious as her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, much le&s;s was &s;he &s;o &s;trict and devout as her younger &s;i&s;ter that was married, as might be ob&s;erved from what pa&s;&s;ed between them at fir&s;t: her temper was &s;prightly and gay; and, though &s;he governed her&s;elf &s;o, that &s;he gave every one room to &s;ee, that &s;he was one that had a true &s;en&s;e of religion at bottom, and a fund of good prin|ciples and notions in her mind; yet &s;he was young and merry, and did not tie her&s;elf up &s;o &s;everely in &s;uch things as her &s;i&s;ters had done; which, though it was no part of her happine&s;s in the affair before her, yet it rendered her very agreeable to her father; and particularly, it made the affair with this gentleman much le&s;s trouble with her, than he had with her two &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>The gentleman was, as I have ob&s;erved, an Italian gentleman, a very hand&s;ome, agreeable per&s;on, perfectly well bred, having lived abroad, and &s;een a great deal of the world. He was al&s;o a man of excellent parts and &s;en&s;e, talked admirably well, almo&s;t to every thing that came in his way, &s;poke &s;everal languages, and in &s;hort, was not only a complete, well-bred merchant, but much
<PB N="150" REF="025384_0149_0FCD10E2EF6F43C8">
of a gentleman; and all this to be added, that he was very &s;ober, grave, and often times, as occa&s;ion offered, his di&s;cour&s;e upon religious affairs di&s;covered him to be very &s;erious and religious. As to his e&s;tate, it was not very well only, but extraordinary; he was indeed a little too old, having lived abroad twenty-two years, and was about &s;o much above twenty, which was the age of the lady. However, as this was an advantage in many other ways, as in his judgment and experience in the world, the father made no &s;cruple at all of it, nor did his daughter inquire much after it.</P>
<P>In a word, having been introduced to the young lady, &s;he mu&s;t have been a woman of much more nicety and &s;cruple, than &s;he profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to be, if &s;he had di&s;liked any thing in his per&s;on or circum&s;tances; and therefore having kept her company for &s;ome weeks, things began to draw near a clo&s;e, when one evening, after the gentle|man had been with her, and gone away, her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter and &s;he happened to meet; and the following dialogue between them may farther explain the ca&s;e.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I look upon what my mother &s;aid, to be good coun&s;el, which we &s;hould give its due weight to: but I do not take it to be a command that binds me ab&s;olutely in duty to my mother's words. Duty certainly ends, when death &s;eparates.</P>

<P>I know not whether it does, no, &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>I think you are too &s;uper&s;titious that way, &s;i&s;|ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but &s;uppo&s;e it to be but as advice, yet it has a double force with it. Fir&s;t, as it came from a tender, dear, and mo&s;t affectionate mother, who not only mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately loved us, but had an excellent judge|ment to direct her to give us the be&s;t coun&s;el. And, Se|condly, as our own judgment and con&s;ciences mu&s;t te&s;tify with her, that what &s;he enjoined us to ob&s;erve, is the mo&s;t rea&s;onable thing for us to do; that can be imagined for our own advantage, and as well for our happine&s;s here as hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You lay a greater &s;tre&s;s upon it than I do, I con|fe&s;s. If my mother had been alive indeed, I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf obliged to be guided by her directions, and her injunctions would have been po&s;itive commands; but then &s;he would have been able to judge of particular circum&s;tances, and would have given her advice accord|ingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But her advice to us was therefore &s;uited
<PB N="152" REF="025384_0151_0FCD10EA62426E78">
to her pre&s;ent &s;tate of ab&s;ence, and went no farther than to a ca&s;e de&s;cribed by its own circum&s;tances, and which nothing can alter; becau&s;e the obligation &s;uppo&s;es the cir|cum&s;tance, and where the circum&s;tance is not, the obliga|tion cea&s;es.</P>

<P>No, &s;i&s;ter, you don't want an explanation, I am &s;ure; but you are di&s;po&s;ed to lay it all a&s;ide, as a thing you have no need of; however, I'll explain my|&s;elf in a word &s;peaking. Our mother warned us again&s;t marrying men of no religion, that is, men that made no profe&s;&s;ion of a reverence to God and his wor&s;hip, this want of a religious profe&s;&s;ion, is the circum&s;tance which I &s;peak of; if the circum&s;tance does not appear, the ad|vice cea&s;es; for our mother knew we could not judge of &s;incerity.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I do know &s;omething more of it too; now I think of it; for we were talking of &s;uch things one night, when we happened to mention one Sir Robert&mdash;, and he &s;poke of him with a great deal of indig|nation; he &s;aid he was a horrid athei&s;tical wretch, and that he could not bear his company; for he was always making a je&s;t of &s;acred things, bantering all religion in &s;uch a manner, that no &s;ober mind could abide it without horror.</P>

<P>Well, there is &s;omething in that I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I take it to be a plain declaration, that he has a ju&s;t reverence for religion, as my &s;i&s;ter took the contrary in her lover, for a declaration of his having no religion at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, he told her he had not, in &s;o many

If I &s;hould talk on that fa&s;hion to him now, what kind of a catechetical wife will he think I &s;hall make? He'll think I &s;hall be a &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s rather than a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; though you are &s;o pert with your &s;i&s;ter, for&s;ooth, you need not be &s;o with him, I hope? nor need I tell you how to manage &s;uch a point: But I war|rant you I would find it out, what his opinion was one way or another: why, he may be a Papi&s;t for aught you know yet of him; &s;ome of them are very religious in their way, and &s;peak very reverently and &s;eriou&s;ly of religion in ge|neral.</P>

<P>Let him be a Papi&s;t and he will, I am &s;ure I can never a&s;k him &s;uch a que&s;tion; but, however, I am pretty well &s;atisfied of that too; for I heard him &s;ay once, he had been at church: and another time accidentally &s;peak|ing about religion, he declared he was a member of the church of England, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<P>There may be zeal, but there is no charity then; and what's any religion without charity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but becau&s;e charity does not always keep pace with religion, and every one is apt to think them&s;elves in the right, and to reproach the &s;incerity of tho&s;e that differ from them; therefore, our mother ear|ne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed us to make that point &s;ure, before we fixed our choice for our lives.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>All this is true, and clears you from the fir&s;t &s;cruple; &s;o far, I may grant, you are within my mother's fir&s;t injunction, Not to marry a man that does not profe&s;s to be religious in general; but that is but one part.

<P>You argue, &s;i&s;ter, from the practice to the duty, as if becau&s;e children do not regard the care and concern of their parents in their marriage, therefore they ought to do &s;o: and it was not the duty of parents to direct them, or concern them&s;elves about it.</P>

And I think this is enough to convince you of the ju&s;tice of our mo|ther's injunctions, that we &s;hould not marry any man, how religious &s;oever he was, unle&s;s he was of the &s;ame o|pinion in religion with our&s;elves; or, as I ob&s;erved above, that, as was the cu&s;tom, the man and the wife might communicate together.</P>

<P>That is then becau&s;e religion it&s;elf is le&s;s in fa&s;hion than it us'd to be, which indeed is too true; al&s;o marriages are now wholly taken up with mirth and gay things; but in tho&s;e days matrimony &s;eems to have been under&s;tood, as it really is in it&s;elf, a &s;olemn and &s;erious thing: not to be ventur'd on ra&s;hly, con&s;ider'd &s;lightly, or perform'd with levity and loo&s;ene&s;s; 'tis a tran&s;action of the greate&s;t weight, attended with circum&s;tances of the greate&s;t importance, and con&s;equences of the utmo&s;t con|cern to our welfare or mi&s;ery; the happine&s;s of life, the pro&s;perity of families, and indeed the intere&s;t of the &s;oul, is exceedingly dependent on the good or bad conduct of both parties in this affair: and to run headlong upon it, is rightly compared to a hor&s;e ru&s;hing into the battle, and argues a mi&s;erable thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of what is before us.</P>

<P>This is one of the &s;tronge&s;t grounds of &s;u&s;|picion to me, and a&s;&s;ures me that he has very little re|gard to religion in general, that he can pretend to mar|ry you, and know nothing whether you are a Heathen or a Chri&s;tian, an Athei&s;t or a religious per&s;on, a Papi&s;t or a Prote&s;tant; the man can have no great value for reli|gion, that it is &s;o little concerned whether his wife have any, or no; for I take the thing to weigh as much on the one &s;ide as on the other, where there is any &s;erious con&s;i|deration at bottom.</P>

and nature of religion, how it con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in natural duties, the effects of the knowledge and acknowledgement of God governing the world, to whom we owed the hom|age of our lives, and all we enjoyed, and mu&s;t account for the u&s;e or abu&s;e of them: then, he ob&s;erved how plea&s;ant and agreeable a religious life was, how it was religion alone that made life happy, families plea&s;ant, &s;ociety a|greeable, and relations comfortable; how mi&s;erably &s;ome families were brought up for the want of it; how beauti|ful it was to &s;ee an unity between relations in matters of that nature, and how dreadful the &s;trife was in families where it was otherwi&s;e.</P>

<P>She &s;at by him, and he held her by the hand all the while: he went on then to tell us a great many plea&s;ant &s;tories of families that he had known; how in &s;ome the hu&s;band was religious, and the wife Athei&s;tic and profane; and in others, the wife was religious, and the hu&s;band raki&s;h, loo&s;e and profligate, and how mi&s;er|able the one made the life of the other. Then he gave him&s;elf a loo&s;e to talk for the con&s;tant, never fading feli|city of families where was a harmony in religious things between hu&s;band and wife; and then, to try her, I &s;up|po&s;e, or perhaps to prevent her thinking he pointed his di&s;cour&s;e at her, he turned to her, and &s;miling, My dear, &s;ays he, if there be any defect, on that account, between you and me, it will be on my &s;ide; but I hope to be help|ed forward by you.</P>

<P>No, no, &s;he took it otherwi&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you, for he might ea&s;ily &s;ee &s;he was not plea&s;ed. However, he went on, and told us a long &s;tory of a couple that were married, and were both very religious, and yet, &s;aid he, they never had any happine&s;s, any agreement, or any practical religion in the family; this put me upon inquiry into the circum&s;tances of it. Why, Madam, &s;ays he, one was of one opinion in religion, and one was of another, both of them were tenacious of their own opinion, and cen&s;orious of the other. One went to one place of wor&s;hip, and another to another: one prayed to
<PB N="168" REF="025384_0167_0FCD110DABEA5EE0">
God in one part of the hou&s;e, and one in another. Why, &s;ays I, they prayed to the &s;ame God I hope; &s;ure charity might have taught them to have prayed together! &s;o far from that, Madam, &s;ays he, that they not only never prayed with one another, but I believe they &s;carce ever prayed for one another in their lives, but looked upon one another as Heathens and Publicans, and &s;uch as God him|&s;elf would not hear.</P>
<P>This was a &s;ad family, Sir, &s;aid I; but I hope there are very few &s;uch in this nation, where religion is &s;o heartily e&s;pou&s;ed. Truly, Madam, &s;ays he, it may teach us what occa&s;ion there is for us to &s;eek out for reli|gious wives, and to take care to be agreeable hu&s;bands to them, when we have them. And here he &s;aid a great many hand&s;ome things indeed of the little concern men generally took upon them&s;elves, either to marry religi|ous wives, or to &s;ee that the opinions of tho&s;e they mar|ried were not too much &s;hocking with their own; and e&s;pecially that when men had religious wives, or women had religious hu&s;bands they did not &s;tudy, as much as lay in them, both &s;ides, to bring their opinions to agree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> one another, bearing with one another, yield|ing as much as po&s;&s;ible to one another, and the like, that, as the &s;cripture &s;aid, their prayers might not be hin|dered.</P>

<P>I am &s;ure her mother and I liked it; but &s;he behaved her&s;elf &s;o &s;imply about it the next day, that gave him a &s;urfeit of her religion, and he declined her after|wards upon that very account; for, as he told me &s;ince, very &s;eriou&s;ly, &s;he di&s;covered &s;uch a temper at that time, &s;uch a general di&s;like of a religious life, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a regular family, that made him particularly afraid of her.</P>

<P>Well, I'll tell you how comfortably they live; I a&s;&s;ure you, though they are patterns to the whole world, for extraordinary affection, and their love is &s;o un|interrupted, that it does make up abundance of other things; yet here, I &s;ay, it makes up no intervals, I can a&s;&s;ure you of it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> verily, that affection, which it is confe&s;&s;ed they have for one another, and for which they are both &s;o admired, makes it wor&s;e; at lea&s;t it makes it the more grievous to bear; and the part I am telling you will prove it; pray let me go on with it. I came back with her and dined; and after dinner, hone&s;t James takes up his gloves and his cane, and came and ki&s;&s;ed her, and prepares to go to the Quaker-meeting. She could hold no longer then, but
<PB N="172" REF="025384_0171_0FCD1116A6B656E0">
bur&s;t out into tears; he was extremely anxious to know what ailed her, but &s;he could not &s;peak; &s;he was unwil|ling to grieve him, and unwilling to &s;ay any thing that was unkind; he pre&s;&s;ed her a long time, and &s;aid a thou|&s;and tender kind things, that I hardly expected from him; but that made her cry the more. At la&s;t, I &s;aid to him, &s;miling, I know what troubles her, but you won't relieve her. Won't I, &s;ays he, a little moved, Why do&s;t thou &s;ay &s;o? I would let out my blood to do her any good; and &s;he knows I will &s;tick at nothing to do for her. Why, &s;ays I, you won't &s;erve God with her. Won't I, &s;ays he, yes, I would with all my heart, if &s;he would let me. This I found laid a foundation for &s;ome di&s;pute about their principles; but &s;he wi&s;ely avoided that, and I perceived it, &s;o I put it off, I dare &s;ay, &s;ays I, &s;he would give all &s;he has in the world, you would but go to church with her now. At that &s;he bur&s;t out, though full of tears, Ay, &s;ays &s;he, I would give him back my jointure with all my heart. He took her in his arms, and with all the tendere&s;t and kinde&s;t expre&s;&s;ions that he was capable of, endeavoured to pacify her, and put an end to it, a thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could not di&s;pute about without unkindne&s;s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">fore better to be avoided: but it took up the whole afternoon to re&s;tore them to one another, and &s;he neither went to the church, nor he to the meeting; and yet here was nothing but kindne&s;s and affection between them all this while.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her ca&s;e, in a word, &s;i&s;ter, is the very ca&s;e our dear mother warned us of; and it is not hard to tell you what &s;he has to complain of; &s;he is a very &s;ober, re|ligious woman, that &s;erves God night and day, with a &s;incerity and devotion not ea&s;y to be found among wo|men, as the world goes now; and I'll tell you what grieves her, and what &s;he complains of. Her hu&s;band is as religious too in his way as &s;he is in hers: but, as there is no harmony or concurrence in their &s;everal prin|ciples and ways of wor&s;hip, &s;o there can be no public, &s;tated family wor&s;hip. He does not join with her, nor &s;he cannot join with him; &s;o all the thing called family religion, the glory of a married &s;tate, and the comfort of family &s;ociety is entirely lo&s;t: the &s;ervants are left un|governed, the children are unguided; and there again is her grief doubled, &s;he has four little young children. It is true, he is a man of too good a humour to deny or re|&s;train her in the education of her children; has it is a &s;ad thing to her to be obliged to in&s;truct and caution her chil|dren again&s;t the practice of their father, who&s;e life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be their pattern, and his practice their example. O &s;i&s;ter! if ever you come to look into &s;uch a condition, with a feeling &s;en&s;e of it as your own, you will find it is not all the tenderne&s;s of the mo&s;t affectionate hu&s;band in the world, can make up the lo&s;s of the&s;e things. On the other hand, he has his di&s;&s;atisfactions too; he is as &s;ad on the account of her difference from him, as &s;he is for his difference from her; &s;o that, in &s;hort, the unhappine&s;s is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tual.</P>

<P>No, no, &s;i&s;ter; I am firm in my opinion; you and I have often argued it when you &s;eemed to be of my mind. It is true, there is a hazard in every part of the change of life; we ri&s;k our peace, our affection, our liberty, our fortunes; but we ought never to ri&s;k our re|ligion.</P>

<P>Yes, truly in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;i&s;ter, you do, and your own words acknowledged it ju&s;t now. Did not you &s;ay, that if he would not be of your opinion, you would be of his?

<P>Well, and is it not very well to do &s;o?</P>

<SP>

<P>If their principles were ill-founded before,
<PB N="175" REF="025384_0174_0FCD111D6966DC98">
they do well to change them, to be &s;ure; but is it not of|tener that they rather abandon principle than exchange it; lo&s;e their religion than increa&s;e it? for you cannot &s;ug|ge&s;t, that all the women who have changed their opi|nions, in compliance with their hu&s;bands, were wrong before, and have changed for the better.</P>

<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is a &s;ad exchange, if it be wrong; for the woman then exchanges the peace of her con&s;ci|ence for peace with her hu&s;band; lo&s;es her religion, and gives up her principles, in&s;tead of exchanging them for better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be &s;ome compliance &s;ure, without entirely abandoning principles; you propo&s;e no medium between right and wrong.</P>

<P>Yes you do, &s;i&s;ter, very well; however I'll repeat it as often as you &s;ay &s;o: I am arguing the ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity of young people comparing their religious principles and opinions before marriage; and &s;eeing that they agree, at lea&s;t &s;o far as to lay no foundation of a re|ligious breach in the family after marriage; that they
<PB N="176" REF="025384_0175_0FCD111EE1FA8068">
may wor&s;hip God together; join in family precepts, and &s;upport family religion; that they may agree in their in|&s;tructions to their children, join in family precepts and examples; that there may be no di&s;putings or dividings again&s;t one another, but a mutual harmony in the propa|gating their own eternal intere&s;ts, and that they may go hand in hand in the true way to heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>And cannot this happen to them without &s;ettle|ment of circum&s;tances before hand, that we mu&s;t capitu|late about religion as we do about jointures, and &s;ettle principles as we do fortunes, always before hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That it may not or cannot happen &s;o, I will not &s;ay: but if you will take the world at large, as it is now &s;tated, between tho&s;e that have no religion at all, and tho&s;e who differ from others, you mu&s;t allow, &s;i&s;ter, it is a lottery of a thou&s;and blanks to one prize; and who that values their own peace, would venture the odds?</P>

<P>It may be &s;een by this dull and empty di&s;cour&s;e on both &s;ides, that this poor young lady went on tanquam boves, like the ox to the &s;laughter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> knowing or con|&s;idering, that it was for her life. She re&s;olved all her &s;cruples into that weak way of an&s;wering, I leave it a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to you, Sir, I hope you are &s;atisfied, Sir; and I'll do as you would have me, Sir, and the like; not con&s;idering, that the had a father that laid no &s;tre&s;s upon any thing, but the money; his whole care was for the &s;ettlement, and the e&s;tate, not inquiring into the principles of the per&s;on, and therefore his an&s;wers are as &s;illy for a fa|ther, as hers were for a wife, viz. That he dare &s;ay the gentleman was a very good, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man; that he has known him a long time; and did not que&s;tion but he was a Prote&s;tant, and the like, in a word, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

all to her father; and the father perfectly indifferent as to matters of religion, left it out of his inquiry. And thus they were married in a few weeks after, and abundance of mirth and jollity they had; which covered all the ap|pearances of other things for a great while.</P>
<P>At length, the lady went home to her hou&s;e in the city, which was magnificently furni&s;hed. Among other rich furniture, the rooms were exceedingly &s;tored with a noble collection of very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> paintings, done by the be&s;t ma&s;ters in Italy; the part of Italy where this gen|tleman had lived, viz. the duke of Tu&s;cany's country, being particularly eminent for choice pictures. It hap|pened after &s;he had been &s;ome time at home, had &s;ettled her hou&s;e, and fini&s;hed the decorations of her rooms, that her hu&s;band bringing &s;ome pictures home, which were newly arrived from Italy, had, among others, three very choice pieces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ong up in their bed-chamber; whereof one being a picture of the crucifixion, and extremely valu|able and fine, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to have hanged up by the bed-&s;ide.</P>
<P>His wife, not u&s;ed to &s;uch things, perfectly ignorant of the de&s;ign, not at all acquainted with the u&s;e made of them in Popi&s;h countries, took no manner of notice of it at fir&s;t, taking it to be only brought in there, as it was a mo&s;t noble piece of painting; and that her hu&s;band thought it was the be&s;t thing he could grace her chamber with. It happened, her two &s;i&s;ters came together &s;ome time after, as is u&s;ual, to &s;ee her hou&s;e, and to &s;ee the fine collection of paintings, which they had been told &s;o much of. And after &s;ome time, their &s;i&s;ter and their new bro|ther led them through all the apartments, which were in|deed extremely fine. The brother-in-law, as what he took great delight in, made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to tell them the de&s;ign of the &s;everal pictures, what places or fine hou&s;es &s;uch and &s;uch repre&s;ented, what &s;tories and what faces others were drawn for; and the like: And, being his wife's &s;i&s;ters, he treated them with all the freedom and kindne&s;s imaginable.</P>
<P>When they came to the crucifixion which hung by the bed-&s;ide, he told them, there was one of the fine&s;t pieces of painting in England; told them the name of the painter
<PB N="181" REF="025384_0180_0FCCDD560EF36098">
that had drawn it, who, he &s;aid, was one of the be&s;t ma|&s;ters in Italy; and I'll a&s;&s;ure you, &s;i&s;ter, &s;ays he, this is counted a fine thing in Italy.</P>
<P>But why mu&s;t it hang in your bed-chamber, brother? &s;ays the other married &s;i&s;ter, not &s;u&s;pecting any thing; for her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter had not told her any thing of what &s;he had &s;aid to her &s;i&s;ter. O Madam, &s;ays he, they always have the&s;e things in their bed-chambers in Italy on a religious account. Well, &s;ays the &s;i&s;ter, but as we do not make u&s;e of them that way, methinks they are better any where el&s;e. Why &s;i&s;ter, &s;ays he, our bed-chambers are places where we are, or ought to be mo&s;t &s;erious. Why, &s;ays &s;he again, but we that are Prote&s;tants do not make a religious u&s;e of them. Not &s;o much per|haps, &s;ays he, as the Romans do; but I cannot &s;ay but they may be u&s;eful to a&s;&s;i&s;t devotion. Not at all, &s;ays the &s;i&s;ter. At lea&s;t, Madam, &s;ays he, they can be no di&s;advantage to us; we want all po&s;&s;ible helps in our ado|rations. We have the promi&s;e of the Spirit of God to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, &s;ays the &s;i&s;ter, very warmly, and need no idola|trous pictures. He &s;aw &s;he was tart, and &s;eemed to he forward to di&s;pute, which he avoided; &s;o he called them to look on another picture, and that pa&s;&s;ed off the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>After they had gone through &s;everal apartments, and had admired the fine paintings, as indeed they well de|&s;erved, they came to his clo&s;et. He would have avoid|ed going in, and told them it was in confu&s;ion, and not worth their &s;eeing; but his wife having told them it was her hu&s;band's clo&s;et, they would not be denied. When they went in, they were &s;urprized with the mo&s;t charm|ing pictures that their eyes had ever beheld, with abun|dance of rarities, which their new brother, being very curious, had picked up in his travels; and, in a little room, on one &s;ide of his clo&s;et, upon a table covered with car|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> of the fine&s;t work they had ever &s;een, &s;tood a pix or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the ho&s;t, all of gold, and above them an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">-piece of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite painting. He was indeed jealous of being betrayed by tho&s;e things, but there be|ing none but the ladies, who had never &s;een &s;uch things before, and knew nothing by the form, they retired with|out
<PB N="182" REF="025384_0181_0FCD112DF4B3DA10">
&s;o much as di&s;covering what it was; and as for his wife, &s;he was &s;o perfectly ignorant, that &s;he was ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed from this place to the other &s;ide of the clo|&s;et, where were abundance of very fine pieces; but here the elder could not forbear ob&s;erving, that all the pictures on that whole &s;ide of the room were religious pieces, and, though &s;till without much &s;u&s;picion, &s;he &s;aid to him, I ob|&s;erve brother, you gentlemen that have lived in Italy, are &s;o in love with popi&s;h cu&s;toms, that you are always full of the&s;e church paintings; here's nothing but repre&s;enta|tions of Chri&s;t and the Virgin Mary, in one &s;hape or ano|ther, in every room in your hou&s;e. She went on je&s;ting|ly for &s;ome time till &s;he came to the upper end of the room, to a picture which hung ju&s;t over an ea&s;y chair, and which had a curtain drawn over it: he thought &s;he would not have let her curio&s;ity outrun her good manners, and &s;o did not apprehend her opening it; but &s;he made no &s;cruple of offering to fling back the curtain; but &s;oon found it would not run back, being, as &s;he found after|wards, to draw up in fe&s;toons with pullies: however, &s;he di&s;covered by what &s;he had done, that the picture was the &s;ame with that in the bed-chamber, viz. A large crucifix, or picture of the crucifixion.</P>
<P>She &s;aid no more, but ha&s;tened to view what was far|ther to be &s;een, yet &s;o, as that it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover &s;he was in no little di&s;order. Her &s;i&s;ter that came with her di&s;covered it fir&s;t, and a&s;ked what ailed her? Then the new married &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he was in, came to her with the &s;ame que&s;tion; &s;he owned to them &s;he was not very well, and that pre&s;ently gave her an excu&s;e to with|draw into the woman's apartment, where &s;he had &s;ome room to recollect her&s;elf. However, &s;he took care not to give the lea&s;t cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect what ailed her, till &s;he got an opportunity, when no body was in the room with her but her younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter (&s;he who was fir&s;t married) and then bur&s;t out into tears, and taking her &s;i&s;ter about the neck, with the greate&s;t pa&s;&s;ion imaginable, O my dear &s;i&s;ter, &s;ays &s;he, this poor child is utterly undone. Undone! &s;ays her &s;i&s;ter, what do you mean? I think &s;he is nobly married. O &s;i&s;ter! I tell you &s;he's undone!

<P>You may be &s;ure it was after this a very unea&s;y hour the two &s;i&s;ters &s;pent in the ceremonies of their vi&s;it, both longing earne&s;tly to be at liberty to talk together, one to di&s;burden her mind which was oppre&s;&s;ed with what &s;he had formerly &s;u&s;pected, and now found confirmed; and the other to hear the particulars of what &s;he was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at.</P>
<P>It was not long before they got away, and as &s;oon as ever they were in the coach, the married &s;i&s;ter &s;aid, Dear &s;i&s;ter, you have &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed me with what you told me ju&s;t now, that I thought every minute an hour till I got away, that I might talk about it; I intreat you what makes you talk as you do?</P>

<P>O &s;i&s;ter! I am too well &s;atisfied of it: I am &s;ure it is &s;o. I &s;u&s;pected it all along before they were married, but now I am convinced of it: I am as &s;ure of it as if I had &s;een him at high ma&s;s.</P>

<P>I did very plainly tell her my &s;u&s;picions; but as I had no ground to fa&s;ten it upon him, it made ve|ry little impre&s;&s;ion upon her; nor could I really &s;ay it was &s;o.</P>

<P>What is it then?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I fear more the in&s;inuations and &s;ub|tilty of his tongue, his unwearied &s;olicitation, the power|ful motives of a man perfectly ma&s;ter of the art of per|&s;ua&s;ion; and that the more &s;weetne&s;s he has in his tem|per (for he is really of a mo&s;t engaging di&s;po&s;ition) the more influence his words will have on her, to win her over to error, not merely complai&s;ance to him as her hu&s;band, but by her not being able to an&s;wer his rea&s;on|ings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s it is hard to re&s;i&s;t the force of tho&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions, the rea&s;ons for which we cannot rid our hands of by argument.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that which is wor&s;e, if there is not break|ing the thing to her; to talk to her of it, is to anticipate her misfortunes. Perhaps he de&s;igns to conceal it from her for good and all, and at lea&s;t it may be a great while before he di&s;covers it; and all that time &s;he will be hap|py, in not thinking her&s;elf &s;o mi&s;erable as &s;he is.</P>

<P>It is becau&s;e you have not been u&s;ed to &s;uch things, child; Why, it is his oratory; it is a little con|&s;ecrated chapel, and there &s;tands an altar and an altar|piece over it, with a crucifix, and the a&s;cen&s;ion painting above that; on either &s;ide there are fine rich paintings, one of the bapti&s;m, and another of the a&s;&s;embly at the fea&s;t of Penteco&s;t, and the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;cending in flaming tongues, and the like.

<P>I cannot &s;ay, Sir, you had delivered her; &s;he &s;eemed re&s;olved to have him; her eyes were dazzled with the gay things &s;he expected, and unle&s;s you had po|&s;itively refu&s;ed your con&s;ent, I fear religion had not hold enough on her thoughts, to have balanced her love of va|nity.</P>

<P>My dear, I have been always too carele&s;s in the&s;e things I remember the ca&s;e of your &s;i&s;ter here, and cannot but reflect how, when in a pa&s;&s;ion, I told her it was none of my bu&s;ine&s;s, my own heart &s;truck me with reproach; for I knew it was my duty. I wi&s;h this poor child had been as &s;trict and as nice in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> matter as her &s;i&s;ter was, though I took it ill then, I &s;ee now &s;he was in the right of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You afflict your&s;elf, Sir, for a ca&s;e that i&s;|&s;ued well; and where, if you were in the wrong, there were no bad con&s;equences: whereas, in this ca&s;e, where the bad con&s;equences have happened, you are no way the cau&s;e, it is all their own doing.</P>
</SP>

<P>But as it is an affliction to me, and that you may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is, providence &s;eems to &s;hew me my &s;in by my puni&s;hment. I acknowledge I was in the wrong before, and it is not owing to my prudence or concern, that your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was not ruined. Be&s;ides, every father that has a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> concern for the &s;ouls of his children, will certainly inquire narrowly into the principles, as well as morals of the per&s;ons they match them to.</P>
<P>[In a word, their father afflicted him&s;elf &s;o much and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon this matter, that his two daughters were obliged to drop their concern for their &s;i&s;ter, and apply all the &s;kill they had to comfort their father. He was &s;o overwhelmed with it that it threw him into a deep melancholy, and that into a fit of &s;ickne&s;s; which, tho' he recovered, yet he did not in a long time thoroughly enjoy him&s;elf; always charging and reproaching him|&s;elf with having ruined his child, having regarded no|thing but the out&s;ide of things, and referring all her happine&s;s to a plentiful fortune, and a gay, extravagant way of living.</P>
<P>This went on &s;ome time. The elde&s;t daughter, who was left with the father, managed things &s;o prudently, that no notice of the&s;e things was taken in the family, and her father readily agreed with both his daughters, that it was by no means proper to let their &s;i&s;ter know
<PB N="192" REF="025384_0191_0191_0FCD1143540B1698">
what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad di&s;covered; concluding, that whenever &s;he di&s;cour&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it her&s;elf, &s;he would come home with a &s;ad heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> her complaint to them fa&s;t enough.</P>
<P>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were all mi&s;taken in their &s;i&s;ter; for, though &s;he di&s;covered the thing, and lived a melancholy life with her hu&s;band upon that occa&s;ion; yet, in eight years that &s;he lived with him, &s;he never complained, or made her &s;orrows known to any of her relations; but carried it with an even, &s;teady temper, and bore all her griefs in her own brea&s;t: as &s;hall be &s;een at large in the next dialogue.]</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE III.</HEAD>
<P>THE new married couple, of whom we have been &s;peaking, lived in all the &s;plendour and greatne&s;s that the highe&s;t degree of private per&s;ons admit of and which a family po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an immen&s;e wealth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;uppo&s;ed to do. He was not only very rich when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> married her, as might be &s;uppo&s;ed by the noble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his hou&s;e, and his very valuable collection of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and rarities, and the like, of which mention has been made, but as he fell privately into a great affair of re|mitting money by way of England to Genoa, for &s;up|ply of the French armies in Italy, he got that way a pro|digious &s;um of money; and yet acting only by corre|&s;pondents at Am&s;terdam, he was liable to no re&s;entment or objections from the government here.</P>
<P>After he had lived thus about eight years, and in the time had &s;ix children by this young lady, he died <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had four of her &s;ix children living. But their father, af|ter having in vain tried all the per&s;ua&s;ions, arguments, and entreaties (for he was too good a hu&s;band, and too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a gentleman, to u&s;e any other method) to bring his wife over to the Romi&s;h church, left her however, under this terrible affliction, that having di&s;po&s;ed of his va&s;t e&s;tate in a very honourable manner, as well to her as to her children, yet he took the education of her children from her, leaving them to the tuition of guardians, to bring them up in the Romi&s;h religion. Nor was this the effect
<PB N="193" REF="025384_0192_0FCD1144655CE548">
of his unkindne&s;s to her; for, except in di&s;putes about the&s;e things, they never had any difference worth the name of a di&s;pute in their lives; and, at his death, he left to her own di&s;po&s;al above &s;ix times the fortune &s;he brought him; but this of his children was a mere point of con&s;cience to him, which he could not di&s;pen&s;e with. This was an inexpre&s;&s;ible grief to her, and that &s;uch, and &s;o heavy, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to repre&s;ent it in this narrow tract, &s;o as to &s;ay how far it afflicted her, or what ill con&s;equences attended it; the drift and de&s;ign of this work al&s;o lying quite another way, viz. To &s;hew the man|ner of life, which naturally attends the be&s;t matches, where the religious principles of the hu&s;band and wife are not the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter was now married al&s;o, and married very happily and comfortably; the principles as well as practice of her hu&s;band, not only concurred entirely with her own, but an&s;wered in a mo&s;t agreeable manner to the character which was given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of him, viz. That he was a per&s;on truly religious.</P>
<P>Their father now grown old, had been a true peni|tent for his mi&s;takes in the pa&s;t conduct of his children, and had fully made up his want of care in his middle daughter's match, by his difficulty in being plea&s;ed for his elde&s;t. She needed no concern for, or to &s;hew any nicety in examining into the per&s;on; for the father was &s;o very nice for her, that &s;carce any thing could plea&s;e him; he rejected &s;everal very good offers, merely on ac|count of religious principles, and put them off without &s;o much as naming them to his daughter, till at la&s;t, fixing upon a merchant in the city, who both for &s;obriety, pie|ty, opinion in religion, and e&s;tate, &s;uited every way both his de&s;ires and his daughter's judgment; the match, un|der &s;uch circum&s;tances, was &s;oon made. The uninter|rupted felicity this young Lady enjoyed, in having the be&s;t hu&s;band, the be&s;t Chri&s;tian, and the be&s;t tempered man in the world, all in one, made her the happie&s;t wo|man alive; and indeed recommended the caution &s;he had always u&s;ed in her choice, by its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Her father lived with this daughter, when he was in town, but otherwi&s;e lived in Oxford&s;hire, with his own

&s;i&s;ter, the lady&mdash;, widow of Sir James&mdash;, of whom mention is made in the fir&s;t part of this work: he lived very ea&s;y, having thus &s;een his family all &s;ettled; for his two &s;ons were very well fixed abroad, the one at Leghorn, and the other at Cadiz; and he might really be &s;aid to have no aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ction in the world but that of his middle daughter, who, though by far the riche&s;t and mo&s;t pro&s;perous in circum&s;tances, and lived in the mo&s;t &s;plendour of all the re&s;t, yet he e&s;teemed really mi&s;erable; and &s;o indeed in one &s;en&s;e &s;he was.</P>
<P>He was at dinner one day at the elde&s;t daughter's hou&s;e, his younge&s;t daughter being ca&s;ually there al&s;o, when, while they were at table, letters came from the Bath, where his middle daughter was gone with her hu&s;band, to acquaint them, that her hu&s;band, after an indi&s;po&s;ition of no more than five days, was dead. It &s;urpri&s;ed them all; for he had not &s;o much as heard that he was ill; and his di&s;temper being a pluri&s;y, it was exceedingly violen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and carried him off very quick|ly.

The account &s;he gave of her life pa&s;t, and of what &s;he had gone through in the eight years of her married &s;tate, upon the particular occa&s;ion of her hu&s;band's being of a different religion.</P>

when all her affairs were in a &s;ettled po&s;ture, that &s;he went to divert her thoughts a little, and unbend her mind from the &s;orrows &s;he had been under, for &s;he was a &s;incere mourner for her hu&s;band; I &s;ay, it was &s;ome months after his death, that her younger &s;i&s;ter having invited her down to her &s;eat in Hamp&s;hire, &s;he went thi|ther, and her father and elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, at her reque&s;t, went all with her.</P>
<P>Here upon a ca&s;ual di&s;cour&s;ing of things pa&s;t, her fa|ther, who was almo&s;t ever bemoaning his neglect in ex|po&s;ing his children, threw out &s;ome words, which fir&s;t gave her to under&s;tand that both he and her &s;i&s;ter knew her hu&s;band was not a Prote&s;tant, at which &s;he &s;eemed very much &s;urpri&s;ed: but, as &s;he found it was known, and that however it was &s;till &s;o far a &s;ecret, as that it had gone no farther than their own brea&s;ts, &s;he was &s;oon made ea&s;y; &s;he then made a confidence of it, earne&s;tly entreating them that it might go no further, which they willingly promi&s;ed for her &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>But this opened the door for variety of conferences a|mong them; as particularly her &s;i&s;ter told her, how they di&s;covered it fir&s;t, and afterwards their father; and re|peated all the di&s;cour&s;es they had had about it, and how, and for what rea&s;on they had re&s;olved never to mention it to her, unle&s;s &s;he &s;poke fir&s;t of it; concluding, that, per|haps, he might conceal it from her, and they would be very loth to di&s;cover a thing to her, which they knew could have no other con&s;equences at that time, but to ruin and afflict her; alas &s;i&s;ter! &s;ays &s;he, I di&s;covered it with|in a fortnight after I came home.</P>

<P>Ay, my dear; but it was my bu&s;ine&s;s to have in|quired farther into it; I might ea&s;ily have known it if I had inquired; for &s;everal merchants told me afterwards of it; but I laid no &s;tre&s;s upon it; in &s;hort, I did not con|&s;ider the con&s;equences.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it was not much above a fortnight after we came home, as I ob&s;erved to you, before I di&s;covered it; and the manner was thus. I wondered that every Sabbath-day my &s;pou&s;e contrived &s;ome excu&s;e or other to avoid going to church with me. I had taken &s;ome notice of it before we went home; but the &s;econd Sab|bath-day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> took upon me to de&s;ire him to go. He &s;eem|ed not to deny me, and went into the coach with me, but pretended a &s;udden thought, he was obliged to go up to St. James's; and having very civilly handed me out of the coach, and gone with me into the very place, made a light bow, when I could not &s;tand to per&s;uade, and went back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did he take the coach too, and leave you to come home on foot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; he never &s;hewed me &s;o little re&s;pect as that. He went but as far as Temple-Bar in the coach, and &s;ent it back, charging the coachman to go and wait for his mi&s;tre&s;s, which he did This however troubled me a little, and I began to be unea&s;y, though I knew not for what.</P>

<SP>

<P>Why, my dear, did nothing occur to your thoughts, as it did to ours, about his pictures, his cruci|fixes, altar-pieces, and &s;uch things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not at all. I had heard my father &s;ay it was the fa&s;hion in Italy; and it being &s;o remote from my
<PB N="199" REF="025384_0198_0FCD114EE8915870">
thoughts to imagine any thing of what was the real ca&s;e. I had indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thoughts at all about it, till the follow|ing affair alarmed me. I was with him one day in his clo&s;et, and viewing his fine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, the pictures, the im|agery, and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, of which he had abundance, and &s;ome pieces of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that are of very great value, he was mighty bu&s;y, and plea&s;ed in &s;hewing me things, and telling me what they were, for then they were as new to me almo&s;t as they were to you. At la&s;t I went into the little room within his clo&s;et, and looked upon all the fine things there, where you know, &s;i&s;ter, there are abundance of valuable pieces of paintings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, it is a charming place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon the table there &s;tood two fine &s;ilver can|dle&s;ticks g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lded, with large wax candles in them. My dear, &s;ays I, like an innocent fool the&s;e candle&s;ticks are very fine, I think, they are much finer than any we have about the hou&s;e.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: after I had done &s;peaking of the candle&s;ticks, I laid my hands upon a large piece of crim&s;on dama&s;k, which &s;eemed to cover &s;ome|thing that &s;tood upon the table and &s;tanding up about &s;even or eight inches high in the middle, looked as if there were &s;everal things together; and going to turn it up, I &s;aid, what is under here, my dear? But added with a &s;mile, and thinking nothing of the matter, may I look? He &s;miled a little, but laying his hand upon it too, I had rather not, my dear; they are things I brought from Italy, but nothing of ornament. Well, well, &s;ays I, let it lie; I don't de&s;ire to look, not I, and immediately turned to look at a picture that hung

<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your curio&s;ity was not much, it &s;eems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Innocence &s;u&s;pects nobody; but a &s;trange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in his countenance gave me an alarm, which I was not a+ware of; there was a vi&s;ible hurry and confu&s;ion in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ace when he laid his hands upon the piece of dama&s;k to prevent my taking it up; and, on a &s;udden, when I &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and unconcernedly pa&s;&s;ed it off, all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> went off his countenance in a moment, and he was as bright and as good humoured again as ever, and this made me think again afterwards that there was &s;omething in it more than u&s;ual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t have been very dull, if you had not, &s;eeing you perceived &s;uch a double alteration; and this would have heightened my de&s;ire to inquire farther into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps it did &s;o too in me; but I &s;aw evi|dently he was concerned; and why &s;hould I make him unea&s;y&punc; I could have pa&s;&s;ed an hundred &s;uch things by, and have re&s;trained my curio&s;ity while I had no &s;u&s;|picion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what was this to the ca&s;e? it &s;eems here was no di&s;covery then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, here was a di&s;covery too, as it prepared for farther ob&s;ervation; I told you that the next day he &s;ent me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ome two pair of candle&s;ticks, which were in|deed very fine: and as I was admiring them, I de&s;ired to have the other fetched down to compare them with; upon which he made &s;ome difficulty, and &s;aid, he could not tru&s;t a &s;ervant to go into his clo&s;et alone, where things of con&s;equence lay about; but, my dear, &s;ays he, we will go up and match them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that rea&s;on was ju&s;t enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;o; and I went up with him to his clo|&s;et, but not into the inner room: but I ob&s;erved ju&s;t when he &s;teps in, he made an extraordinary low bow towards that place where the candle&s;ticks &s;tood. Indeed I took no notice of it at fir&s;t, for I verily thought he had &s;tooped for &s;omething; but, when he carried the candle|&s;ticks
<PB N="201" REF="025384_0200_0FCCDD5F26884DB8">
in again, he did the &s;ame, and that gave me &s;ome thought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was a di&s;covery indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No really it was not yet; for I was a perfect &s;tranger to any of their Popi&s;h ceremonies; I &s;carce un|der&s;tood it when I was told: but however it gave me &s;ome idea of this being an extraordinary place, though I did not know what; and I very innocently a&s;ked him this fooli&s;h, laughing que&s;tion; My dear, you are mighty mannerly to your empty rooms, you bow as if the king was there. He put it off with a &s;mile, and an an&s;wer that was indeed according to Solomon, an&s;wer a fool in his folly: my dear, &s;ays he, it was our cu&s;tom in Italy.</P>

<P>He was no fool; what he &s;aid was very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, even all this while, and farther, I was &s;till blind; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, a little while after I pu&s;hed into the &s;ame place with him, not out of curio&s;ity, but merely by chance; but though the piece of crim&s;on dama&s;k lay up|on the table, yet there was nothing under it, nor did he make any bow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as before.</P>

<P>Well, however, as that was more than I knew, it cau&s;ed all my former he&s;itations and ob&s;ervations to van|i&s;h, till they were renewed again upon the following oc|ca&s;ion: He was taken ill one evening, in a manner that alarmed me very much, and we were obliged to get him to bed with all &s;peed; but ju&s;t as he was undre&s;&s;ing by the bed-&s;ide he &s;tarted up in a kind of rapture, and pul|ling a &s;tring which dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w back a curtain, he ca&s;t up his eyes towards a picture that hung there, and &s;aid &s;ome words which I did not under&s;tand, and I perceived he cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf two or three times on the brea&s;t, and then &s;teps into bed.</P>

<P>Indeed, &s;i&s;ter, I did not do &s;o; I was oppre&s;&s;ed with the terror of it, and the di&s;appointment, but my affection &s;tept in the way of all re&s;entment; I loved him tenderly; and be&s;ides, it was not a time for it; for he was really very ill, and thought he &s;hould have died; it was a &s;pice or ta&s;te of the &s;ame di&s;temper that did at la&s;t kill him, for it was a pleuri&s;y; and after he had &s;lept a little he waked again in &s;uch a condition, that frighted all the hou&s;e, and we were forced to fetch a &s;urgeon out of his bed to let him blood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that relieved him, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it did; but I name it to tell you a cir|cum&s;tance which attended it: we had in the hou&s;e an old man, an Italian, whom he always kept in the compt|ing-hou&s;e to copy his letters, and tran&s;late his Italian accompts, and for &s;uch other bu&s;ine&s;s as he employed him in; and they called him doctor: the &s;urgeon we had &s;ent for being in bed, did not come time enough, and he grew black and de&s;perately ill, which frighted me exceed|ingly; and when he &s;aw I was under a &s;urpri&s;e he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;igns (for he could not &s;peak to be under&s;tood, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bad) to call up the old Italian.

finger, every one might under&s;tand that he meant he &s;hould let him blood; upon which, immediately the old man called for things proper, and I found he had a lan|cet in his pocket. I a&s;ked him if he had been u&s;ed to it: he &s;aid, yes, Madam, I have let him blood &s;everal times before now. In a word, he opened a vein, and it gave him ea&s;e, and he recovered &s;oon after.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No really; at lea&s;t not &s;o; as I believe is u&s;ual; he frequently let fall &s;ome words about it, but with great mode&s;ty; for he was really a very good &s;ort of man, exceeding retired and devout: very mannerly and re&s;pectful: he &s;poke once at table (for &s;ometimes my &s;pou&s;e would a&s;k me to let him &s;up with us) and we had been talking very cheerfully, when the Doctor &s;aid &s;omething in Italian to his ma&s;ter, that gave me plain rea&s;ons to know, that he de&s;ired I &s;hould know what he &s;aid; upon which my &s;pou&s;e &s;aid to me, my dear, what do you think the doctor &s;ays?

<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear &s;i&s;ter, you are too tender a wife your&s;elf not to know that where there is a &s;incere affection, even the highe&s;t re&s;entment expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in the &s;ofte&s;t terms. I could afflict my&s;elf freely, but I could not think of af|flicting him; and tho' I do acknowledge I thought my|&s;elf ill treated, yet I could not u&s;e him ill in return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come tell us what you &s;aid to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, when he pre&s;&s;ed me to let him know, what di&s;turbed me, I told him, I had rather bear my grief than complain to him; that I was too &s;en&s;ible he knew what I meant, when I &s;aid I was undone; and I begged him not to oblige me to blame him, for having been unju&s;t to me. Why, my dear, &s;ays he, why are you undone; if your opinion in religion and mine may differ, mu&s;t is affect our love? cannot we bear with one another
<PB N="205" REF="025384_0204_0FCD115536B89738">
without entering into any di&s;putes; but I did reckon my|&s;elf undone for all that. Tears &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">opt my very breath for a while, for this was an open acknowledgement of his profe&s;&s;ion; and I would fain have flattered my&s;elf &s;o much, as to hope there was yet &s;ome room to have thought my|&s;elf mi&s;taken. When he &s;aw me &s;o overwhelmed, he came to me, and took me in his arms, and &s;aid all the kind things it is po&s;&s;ible to think of, to pacify me: my dear, &s;ays he, though you may think this a grief to you, expect to have it made up to you abundantly, by all that is po&s;|&s;ible for man to do to oblige you: and indeed if all the affectionate things a man could &s;ay or do, could make it up, it was made up to me; if it was po&s;&s;ible for a man to do any thing to make a woman forget her di&s;appointment, he did it; and this from a man too, who had a perfect under&s;tanding of every thing that could oblige and en|gage the affections: in a word, no man could do more, or woman de&s;ire more, to make up the lo&s;s.</P>

<P>Well; &s;i&s;ter, and pray tell me, did it do? was it fully made up to you? is it po&s;&s;ible that two can be happy in the condition of man and wife, where two opi|nions in religion differ? you have had the experience of it to be &s;ure in its be&s;t fortune, with all the advantages imaginable; now be plain, and tell us, is it po&s;&s;ible the conjugal felicity can be complete? was our dear mother in the right or no, &s;i&s;ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, &s;i&s;ter, you put hard upon me, becau&s;e I know I too much &s;lighted my mother's injunctions: and I remember I je&s;ted with you about it; but I paid for the experiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear &s;i&s;ter, tho&s;e things are forgotten long ago, I did not intend to reflect upon them; but I a&s;k upon a &s;erious account, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, &s;i&s;ter, I mu&s;t acknowledge, it is impo&s;&s;ible. I &s;ay again, I find by &s;ad experience, it is impo&s;&s;ible: no kindne&s;s, no tenderne&s;s, no affection, can make it up; the condition can never be happy, God faithfully &s;erved, children rightly educated, the mind perfectly ea&s;y, or the duty of the relation faithfully per|formed, where the opinions in religion differ.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, all one! for we never entered into the que&s;tion about our principles. I re&s;olved it from the be|ginning to avoid bringing on any thing that might be un|kind or di&s;obliging between us, and he approved it, and did the &s;ame for the &s;ame rea&s;on; &s;o that I never, after the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o much as inquired what his opinion was: it was &s;ufficient to have the grief that we could not wor&s;hip God together, either abroad or at home; we could not think of one another with charity, but as deceived per&s;ons, out of the way of eternal felicity, out of God's ble&s;&s;ing and protection; we could not look upon one ano|ther but with &s;ighs and &s;ad hearts. Again, we could ne|ver conver&s;e with one another upon religious &s;ubjects, for we could not enter upon the lea&s;t &s;erious thing, but it led us into contradictions and wild di&s;tracted notions, which we were immediately forced to take the help of our affec|tions to &s;uppre&s;s, that we might not break out into inde|cencies to one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, &s;i&s;ter, and what became of your &s;mart an&s;wers to my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;, when &s;he and you talked of the&s;e things, viz. That if he was not of your opinion, you would be of his; that if he was a Chri&s;tian Catholic, you was a Catholic Chri&s;tian; and &s;o you would have no dif|ference about that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly &s;i&s;ter, I was young, and did not con&s;ider what I &s;aid! and be&s;ides, I did not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect what my &s;i&s;ter &s;ugge&s;ted; and yet &s;o far have I kept up to it, we have by the help of abundance of good humour on his &s;ide, and a great deal of love on both &s;ides, avoided differences and di&s;putes upon that &s;ubject: but, alas! &s;i&s;ter, that is but a negative, and it can only he &s;aid we did not quarrel, which is a great deal to &s;ay too; but, what is this to a happy life? how was our fa|mily guided, our children educated, and how would they have been educated, if he had lived? and how was God wor&s;hipped? he and his prie&s;t at their ma&s;s in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or chapel, I, and my little unhappy babies in my chamber and clo&s;et, where I mourned over them co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">|ally (rather than prayed over them) to think that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

time or other, they &s;hould be &s;natched from me, and brought up in Popery; nor would it have been much otherwi&s;e, if he had been of any other irreconcileable opinion; for, as I told you before, though I knew his opi|nion, I never a&s;k'd it; for any opinion, where there is not a harmony in wor&s;hiping, a joining in public prayer to God, and in joint &s;erving him in our families, is the &s;ame thing, only not in the &s;ame extreme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but had you no private breaches about it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, never; we carefully avoided it: but this is but an evidence of the dreadful con&s;equences of &s;uch marriages in general: for, where is there a couple that can &s;ay, as we could, that they have had no jars about it? And what breaches have religious differences made in fa|milies&punc; But, if the happine&s;s is &s;o little, and the evil con&s;equences &s;o many, even with a hu&s;band &s;o exqui&s;itely kind and obliging, and where a woman cannot &s;ay &s;he has any other thing to complain of, what mu&s;t be the ca&s;e in other families?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, &s;i&s;ter, you hint that the longer you lived, the wor&s;e tho&s;e differences grew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it was impo&s;&s;ible, &s;i&s;ter, but as we grew forward, the&s;e things mu&s;t have come more in our way: We have four children, and Mr.&mdash;was not a man &s;o indifferent in his religion, as to be more carele&s;s about the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his children, that I a&s;&s;ure you; and though he left them entirely to my management; when they were little; yet he would hint &s;ometimes, that he hoped I would leave them free, when they grew up to chu&s;e for them&s;elves, as God &s;hould enlighten them; and that at lea&s;t we &s;hould both &s;tand neuter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could you &s;ay to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him I could not tell how far I could pro|mi&s;e that; for, if I thought my&s;elf in the right way to heaven, I could but ill an&s;wer it to him that gave me my children, to &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee them go wrong, and not endeavour to per&s;uade them (at lea&s;t) to chu&s;e better for them&s;elves. He told me, that was an argument ju&s;t as &s;trong on his &s;ide, as it was on mine: and he added, &s;miling, How &s;hall we do to agree, my dear, when it
<PB N="208" REF="025384_0207_0FCD1159D2AE41D0">
comes to that? I hope we &s;hall not love le&s;s than we do now. I told him I had a great many melancholy thoughts about it; and thus at la&s;t we were always fain to drop the di&s;cour&s;e; but to this hour I cannot conceive how we &s;hould have done to have divided our children's in&s;truction between us, if he had lived to &s;ee them grow up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear, God has otherwi&s;e ordered it; and I hope the children will have the benefit of a good in&s;truction now without that interruption.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, by his will he has appointed the old prie&s;t, whom I named above, to be tutor to my two &s;ons, and has &s;ettled his e&s;tate &s;o, that, unle&s;s the tru&s;tees bring them up Roman Catholics, a great deal of his e&s;tate goes from them; &s;o that I am robbed of my children.</P>
</SP>

<P>He has left them to me.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you know this before, child? had you any di&s;cour&s;e about it before he died?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, as much as the violence of his di&s;tem|per would admit. I entreated, I per&s;uaded, I argued, as much as tears and my oppre&s;&s;ed thoughts would allow me; for I thought my heart would have bur&s;t while I talked to him, to &s;ee his condition, whom I loved as my &s;oul, and to think what was to befal my children; you can hardly conceive what a time it was to me; it wounds my very &s;pirit to look back upon it.</P>

<P>He begged of me not to important him; he told me it was far from being an unkindne&s;s to me, but his con&s;cience obliged him to it, and he could not die in peace, if he did not, as far as in him lay, provide for the &s;ouls of his children.</P>

<P>Why, he &s;aid, he thought I had a right to their government, as a half of the family; for, my dear, &s;ays he, we are partners, but, &s;ays he, I entreat you, and as far as I am able to do it, enjoin you to it, let the poor in|nocent babes be reconciled to the church, and brought up in the Catholic faith; and I hope you will, in God's due time, embrace it your&s;elf.</P>

<P>Not that altogether, &s;i&s;ter, though that might join: but it was the effect of an excellent di&s;po&s;ition, and of an inexpre&s;&s;ible affection to me in particular; for other|wi&s;e he was the mo&s;t zealous man in his way that ever was heard of, and thought every body an enemy to him, that would not be of his own opinion.</P>

<P>I grant that it is difficult to re&s;i&s;t the influence of &s;o much affection; and every thing that came from &s;o &s;incere a principle, and to a mind prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with all the &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s and kindne&s;s po&s;&s;ible to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed, make a deep impre&s;&s;ion; but I thank God I &s;tood my ground.</P>

<P>Well, well, you would not have &s;tood it long, I am per&s;uaded; and this is one of the great haz|ards a woman runs in marrying a man of a different religion, or a different opinion from her&s;elf, viz. That her affection to her hu&s;band is her wor&s;t &s;nare; and &s;o that which is her duty and her greate&s;t happine&s;s, is made the mo&s;t dangerous gulph &s;he can fall into. Well might our dear mother warn us from marrying men of different opinions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, I acknowledge it; my love was my temptation, my affection to my hu&s;band went always neare&s;t to &s;tagger my re&s;olution; I was in no danger upon any other account.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear &s;i&s;ter, let me confe&s;s to you, fine pre&s;ents, flattering words, and the affectionate looks of &s;o oblig|ing, &s;o dear, and &s;o near a relation, are dreadful things, when they a&s;&s;ault principles; the glittering jewel had a &s;trange influence, and my affections began to be too par|tial on his &s;ide: O let no woman that values her &s;oul, venture into the arms of a hu&s;band of a different reli|gion? The kinder he is, the more likely to undo her; every thing that endears him to her, doubles her danger; the more &s;he loves him, the more &s;he inclines to yield to him; the more he loves her, the &s;tronger are the bonds by which he draws her; and her only mercy will be, to have him barbarous and unkind to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed a &s;ad ca&s;e, where to be mi&s;er|able is the only &s;afety; but &s;o it is, no doubt; and &s;uch is the ca&s;e of every woman that is thus un&s;uitably match|ed. If her hu&s;band is kind, he is a &s;nare to her; if un|kind, he is a terror to her; his love, which is his duty, is her ruin; and his &s;lighting her, which is his &s;candal, is her protection.</P>

<P>It is my ca&s;e, dear &s;i&s;ter; &s;uch a jewel! &s;uch a hu&s;band! how could I &s;peak an unkind word: every thing he did was &s;o engaging, every thing he &s;aid was &s;o moving, what could I &s;ay or do?</P>

<P>I &s;tood up and thanked him with a kind of ce|remony, but told him, I wi&s;hed it had been rather in a|ny other form. Why, my dear, &s;ays he, &s;hould not the two mo&s;t valuable forms in the world be placed together? I told him that as he placed a religious value, upon it, he &s;hould have it rather in another place. He told me, my brea&s;t &s;hould be his altar; and &s;o he might adore with a double delight. I told him, I thought he was a little profane; and &s;ince I did not place the &s;ame value upon it, or make the &s;ame u&s;e of it as he did, I might give him offence by mere nece&s;&s;ity, and make that difference

I told him, I hoped I &s;hould not undervalue it as his pre&s;ent, if he did not overvalue it upon any other account.

<P>No, &s;i&s;ter, you would not have done &s;o, I am &s;ure; neither was it my bu&s;ine&s;s to do &s;o: my bu&s;ine&s;s was not to quarrel with my hu&s;band about his religion, which it was now too late to help, but to keep him from being un|ea&s;y about mine.</P>

<P>Nay, &s;i&s;ter, that's expre&s;sly contrary to the &s;cripture, where this very ca&s;e is &s;tated in the plaine&s;t manner imaginable, "The woman that hath a hu&s;band which believeth not, if he will dwell with her, let her not leave him," 1 Cor. vi. 1, 3.</P>

<P>That had been to de&s;ire him not to be a Ro|man Catholic: why, in foreign countries, that are pop|i&s;h, as I under&s;tand, they never go by a cro&s;s, whether it be on the road, or on a building, but they pull off their hats.</P>

<SP>

<P>Yes, Sir, my &s;pou&s;e de&s;ired me to put it on, and I could not well deny him; but I did not know how to

behave; for the amba&s;&s;ador and all his retinue paid &s;o many bows and homages to me, or to the cro&s;s, that I &s;carce knew what to do with my&s;elf, nor was I able to di&s;tingui&s;h their good manners from their religion; and it was well I did not then under&s;tand Italian; for, as my dear told me afterwards, they &s;aid a great many religious things that would have given me offence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e things are &s;o frequent in Italy, that the Pro|te&s;tant ladies take no notice of them, and yet they all wear cro&s;&s;es, but &s;ometimes put them out of &s;ight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did &s;o afterwards, I lengthened the &s;tring it hung to, that it might hang a little lower, but it was too big, if it went within my &s;tays it would hurt me; nor was it much odds to him; for, if he &s;aw the &s;tring, he knew the cro&s;s was there, and it was all one.</P>

<P>Dear, I did &s;o for months together: But then he doubled his ceremonies, and told me, I only mortified him then by obliging him to reverence the place where once the ble&s;&s;ed figure had been lodged, as the holy pil|grims wor&s;hipped the &s;epulchre.</P>

than I mu&s;t have had perhaps with any other man of his principles in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, only this I mu&s;t add, viz. that tho&s;e engaging ways would certainly, fir&s;t or la&s;t, have brought you to Popery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, &s;i&s;ter; but I cannot &s;ay, when I &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on it, how far I might have been left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, let me a&s;k you a que&s;tion or two about that: I know the fir&s;t method they take in &s;uch ca&s;es, is to let you &s;ee that you have been mi&s;taken in your notions about Popery; that the difference is not &s;o great as has been &s;ugge&s;ted to you; that we are all Chri&s;tians; that we wor&s;hip the &s;ame God; believe the &s;ame creed; expect eternal life by the merits of the &s;ame Saviour, and the like; and by this method they bring us at fir&s;t not to have &s;uch frightful ideas of the Roman Catholic religion as we had before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true; and this I had frequently in di&s;|cour&s;e; and, I confe&s;s, &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e had &s;ome effect on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>It le&s;&s;ened the aver&s;ion you had to them, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, they became not &s;o frightful to me as before; but they had another argument which my dear often u&s;ed to me, and it was this: My dear, &s;ays he, all your own divines, and all that have written on the&s;e &s;ubjects, own that a Papi&s;t, as you call us, may be &s;aved; that it is po&s;&s;ible for us to go to heaven. Our church have no rea&s;on to believe &s;o of the Prote&s;tants, why, if you may go to heaven among us, &s;hould you not join with us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what an&s;wer I &s;hould have given to that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what your an&s;wer would have been, but I'll tell you what mine was; I told him I did not know but it might be &s;o; and I was willing to have as much charity as I had affection for him; but as for my|&s;elf, I was &s;ure I could not go to heaven that way, be|cau&s;e I mu&s;t act again&s;t my own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an&s;wer indeed. What could he &s;ay to it?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="218" REF="025384_0217_0FCD116FE6BF5790">
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he told me, he would pray for me that I might be farther enlightened; and he did not doubt but to prevail. I thanked him, and told him, I would do the &s;ame for him; and that though perhaps it might not be with &s;o &s;trong a faith, I was &s;ure it would be with as earn|e&s;t a de&s;ire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you &s;tood your ground nobly, &s;i&s;ter; but 'tis a mercy to you, that your per&s;everance was tried no farther: 'tis a dreadful thing to have &s;o dangerous an enemy &s;o near one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, there lay my danger; for I mu&s;t own, words &s;poken with &s;o much tenderne&s;s have a &s;in|gular effect, and &s;ink deeper on the mind than others, e&s;pecially where the affection is &s;o mutual as it was with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. &s;i&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;i&s;ter, do you think in time his ten|derne&s;s, and his affectionate way of treating you would not have abated?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I often feared it, but indeed I never found it. Sometimes I &s;ugge&s;ted it to him, that I feared it; and one day I told him, that if I did not turn, I was afraid he would. He gue&s;&s;ed what I meant, but would have me explain my&s;elf. Why, my dear, &s;ays I, when I reflect what your thoughts are about Prote&s;tants, That they are out of the pale of the church, and in a condition that they cannot be &s;aved, I cannot but apprehend, that if I do not come over to your opinion, your love to me will abate, and at la&s;t turn into a &s;tated aver&s;ion and hatred: how can you love an object whom you think God hates? My dear, &s;ays he, taking me very affectionately in his arms, I will prevent all your fears, by telling you, that, were what you mention po&s;&s;ible, it could not be till I utterly de|&s;paired of your ever being brought over to the church and I &s;hall never be brought to believe, but God will open your eyes fir&s;t or la&s;t; and, be&s;ides, my earne&s;t de&s;ire to per&s;uade you, and win you to embrace the true religion will teach me to do it by all the tenderne&s;s and love that it is po&s;&s;ible for me to &s;hew you; for, to be unkind to you, would be the way to drive you farther off: but, be it as it will, I can never abate my affection to you; and, my dear, &s;ay he, (with the mo&s;t obliging pa&s;&s;ionate air of con|cern
<PB N="219" REF="025384_0218_0FCD11716328A410">
that it was po&s;&s;ible to &s;hew) that I hope, to love you tenderly and violently, is not the way to keep you at a di&s;tance from the church, but rather to draw you, to en|gage you, and let you &s;ee, that peace, love, joy, charity, and all the virtues of a Chri&s;tian, are to be found among us, and not that we are furies and tyrants, as we have been repre&s;ented. And when he had &s;aid this, holding me &s;till in his arms, he ki&s;&s;ed me &s;everal times, and went on: My dear, &s;ays he, let God alone change your heart his own way; I'll never take any method, but that of loving you &s;incerely and mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately while I live, and praying for you even after I am in heaven. While he &s;aid this, I &s;aw &s;uch an inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s in his countenance, and every word came from him with &s;uch pa&s;&s;ion, that I could not hold from tears: but he had not done with me yet; for, while he held me with one arm, he put his other into his pocket, and taking out his pocket-book, he bid me open it, and there dropt a loo&s;e paper, doubled pretty thick, which I took up; &s;ays he, put it up, you &s;hall have a pledge for the continuance of my affection to you, whether you change your opinion or no. I open|ed it, but could read very little of it, for I had but newly begun to learn Italian. What is it, my dear, &s;aid I. It is, &s;aid he, an a&s;&s;ignment on the Bank of Genoa for 2000 ducats a-year, and it &s;hall be made over to your father in tru&s;t for you, and to whoever you will be&s;tow it after you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was as much religion in our hou&s;e, as it was po&s;&s;ible there could be, in our circum&s;tances; for both of us de&s;ired it in general, and pur&s;ued it in particular, only we could not join in the manner; and it was a per|fect &s;cene of confu&s;ion, to &s;ee how religion was carried on among us; the &s;ervants were &s;ome Papi&s;ts, &s;ome Prote&s;|tants, &s;ome Pagans; for we had three Ea&s;t-India blacks and one negro among our people. The Chri&s;tian &s;ervants were every now and then together by the ears, about per|&s;uading the negro to turn Chri&s;tian, and be baptized, but could not bear to think what &s;ort of a Chri&s;tian the poor creature &s;hould be; one of our men, an Italian, would have him be a Papi&s;t, and the other would have him to be a Prote&s;tant; and the poor negro was &s;o confounded be|tween them, that he could not tell what to do. The negro was a &s;en&s;ible, inqui&s;itive fellow, and had, by mere a&s;king que&s;tions on both &s;ides, gotten a great deal of knowledge of religion: but was nearly &s;topt in his &s;earch after fur|ther particulars by the impertinent quarrels of tho&s;e &s;ervants who pretended to in&s;truct him: both told him he mu&s;t believe a God, a future &s;tate, a heaven, a hell, a re&s;urrection to life, or to death, and that he mu&s;t be &s;aved by a Redeemer. They agreed exactly in their de|&s;cription of the joys of eternal life, the torments of hell, and particularly they had joined in giving the poor negro a frightful apprehen&s;ion of hell, as the reward of his do|ing wickedly, and of the devil as a tempter, an enemy, and tormentor; &s;o that the poor fellow would pray to God very heartily to &s;ave him from hell, and to keep him from the devil.</P>
<P>But when the&s;e poor ignorant fellows began to in&s;truct him how to wor&s;hip God, and who to look to as his Re|deemer and Saviour; to talk to him about reading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;criptures, and &s;uch things, they fell out to the la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; the Engli&s;h footman told the Italian he was an idolater, and he was wor&s;e than a heathen; that Ne|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o the poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was call'd) was as good a Chri&s;tian as he; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> he did not wor&s;hip in the name of Chri&s;t, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Italian footman) wor&s;hip|ped

<P>Nay, that need not be &s;uppo&s;ed; for we go upon our mother's principle, That without a religious family there can be no happine&s;s of life: if they are, as I &s;aid before, indifferent about religion, then there is no happine&s;s at all, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;en&s;e of felicity; and if they place their happine&s;s in pur&s;uing their duty, as every true Chri&s;|tian mu&s;t, there mu&s;t be &s;ome of that happine&s;s wanting, where they cannot wor&s;hip God together, and go hand in hand to heaven.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>IN the latter part of the di&s;cour&s;e we left the aunt and the widow &s;i&s;ter, who had married the Roman Ca|tholic gentleman, entering into a di&s;cour&s;e about the in|conveniencies of entertaining irreligious &s;ervants; and al&s;o of entertaining &s;ervants of different per&s;ua&s;ions and opinions in religion, one from another, or of different opi|nions from the family they &s;erve in. The ladies put off the di&s;cour&s;e of that affair for another time, the aunt being willing to enter into a more particular conver&s;ation about it. This cau&s;ed &s;everal entertaining di&s;cour&s;es among them at &s;everal times, &s;ome of which, I hope, may be u&s;e|ful to be made public for the direction of other families, and for the encouragement of all ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families, who de&s;ire to promote good government and re|ligious things among their children and &s;ervants; and particularly in &s;uch a time as this, when it is known that &s;ervants are le&s;s apt to &s;ubmit to family regulations, and good hou&s;ehold government, than ever.</P>
<P>The two ladies being at their aunt's hou&s;e, which was at Hamp&s;tead, as I have ob&s;erved, their aunt had a little &s;quabble with one of her maids upon the following occa|&s;ion: The maid had, it &s;eems, been out in the afternoon of a Sabbath day, and &s;taid longer than the u&s;ual time of being at church: and her lady, who otherwi&s;e had known nothing of it, happened, unluckily for the wench

why &s;o &s;he may be, for aught I know; and I think we have &s;o much religion at home, we need not go abroad for it: does not the chaplain teaze us twice a-day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his long prayers, and reading of chapters?

<P>Nay, I don't under&s;tand it; I know nothing of the matter; I come to do my bu&s;ine&s;s and mind the kit|chen; if their dinners are not di&s;hed up, they may find fault, and I &s;hould take &s;ome care to mend it, but, to talk to me about religion, 'tis time enough hereafter, let them let me alone to my&s;elf.</P>

<P>'Tis no matter for that, they do the &s;ame at church; and pray what is the difference between my going into the fields to take my plea&s;ure on Sundays, and their going to church to take their ca&s;e? between my wa&s;hing my di&s;hes, while the chaplain is at prayers, and their be|ing fa&s;t a&s;leep at prayers?</P>

<P>Why, Moll, thou art very malicious to take no|tice of &s;uch things; and they are faults, to be &s;ure; but there is a va&s;t difference in them too.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus: That though they may &s;ometimes drop a&s;leep, 'tis not always; and they do it but &s;eldom, You, it &s;eems, make the other a practice, and do it al|ways: Then, if they do &s;leep &s;ometimes at church or at prayers, they don't pretend to &s;ay there is no harm in it, they mu&s;t acknowledge they ought not to do &s;o; but you have the impudence to &s;ay, when you &s;pend your time in the fields, or perhaps wor&s;e, there is no harm in it.

<P>I can't &s;ay that, Mary; I think if you were a mi&s;tre&s;s, and kept a great many &s;ervants, as our mi&s;|tre&s;s does, you would talk otherwi&s;e and do otherwi&s;e too, or el&s;e you would &s;oon have a hou&s;e full of whores and rogues.</P>

<P>I don't know what I would do then, nor do I trouble my head with it; for I am never like to be tried with it: but if I was a hou&s;e-keeper; and kept maids, I would take care they &s;hould do my bu&s;ine&s;s, and that would keep them from making &s;uch a di&s;orderly hou&s;e as you &s;peak of; as for their religion I &s;hould not trouble my&s;elf about it.</P>

<P>You would! And if I was your maid, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould make me come into prayers every night and morning, would you?</P>

<P>Yes, I would, or you &s;hould not live with me.</P>

<P>You mu&s;t think, however, my mi&s;tre&s;s takes him otherwi&s;e, and thinks it her duty to keep him, and to have good order in her hou&s;e; and it does not become us that are &s;ervants to mock at &s;uch things: No <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or mi&s;tre&s;s that knew their &s;ervants mocked at God's wor&s;hip in their hou&s;e, ought to keep tho&s;e &s;ervants an hour longer in their families.</P>

<P>No, I don't &s;ay I would make you go to church, but you &s;hould either go to God's wor&s;hip, or go about your bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what if I were I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and did not like your way, or did not care to go to your church? Or, what if you were a di&s;&s;enter, and I did not like to go to the meeting-hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Mary, in general, I &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> were

the real ca&s;e, I would not re&s;train you, provided I was &s;atisfied you went but &s;omewhere; but your di&s;pute with my mi&s;tre&s;s is between going &s;omewhere and no|where, not between &s;erving God in this manner or that manner, but between &s;erving God &s;ome way or other, and &s;erving him no way at all; and that alters the ca&s;e mightily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as to the matter of coming to prayers at home, it would be the &s;ame thing: for, if I were a Church woman, and my mi&s;tre&s;s a di&s;&s;enter; or I a di&s;&s;enter, and my mi&s;tre&s;s of the Church; or I a Quaker, and my mi&s;|tre&s;s a Roman C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tholic, or my mi&s;tre&s;s a Quaker, and I a Catholic, it would be all the &s;ame thing; there would be the &s;ame di&s;like and contempt of what was done in the hou&s;e; I &s;hould no more like the cro&s;&s;es and the ma&s;&s;es of the Papi&s;ts, the yea and nay of the Quakers, and read|ing prayers of the Church, or extempore prayers of the Pre&s;byterians, if I was of the other opinion, than I now like any of them, while I declare I under&s;tand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of them; and &s;o all their family doings would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> je&s;t to me; and I'll make a je&s;t of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, this is too true; and therefore I mu&s;t own, that if I were mi&s;tre&s;s of a hou&s;e, I would always have my &s;ervants go to the &s;ame place, to &s;erve God, as I did my&s;elf, or I would not keep them; whether I went to the Church, or to the Meeting-hou&s;e; or to the Quak|ers-meeting, or to the Ma&s;s-hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what would you be the better? They would but make a je&s;t of you &s;till; they would be not the more of your opinion for forcing them to go where you went.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mi&s;take me much; I mean they &s;hould be &s;uch as by choice went to wor&s;hip &s;o before they came to me, and that declared their opinion to be &s;o when I hired them: For otherwi&s;e, I grant, that compelling them afterwards would be nothing at all, or perhaps wor&s;e than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, &s;uch an one, when I a&s;ked her whether

&s;he went to this or that place, &s;hould &s;ay yes to any of them, as I happened to be my&s;elf, and &s;o I might be de|ceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what would you do then, when you found her out, and met her on the back-&s;tairs, Be&s;s, as my mi&s;tre&s;s has done by me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I &s;hould do ju&s;t as my mi&s;tre&s;s has done with you, inquire about it, and when I found you a re|probate profane wench, and a &s;aucy one too, as it &s;eems you acknowledge you have &s;hewn your&s;elf to day, I &s;hould e'en give you warning to mend your manners, or provide your&s;elf, as it &s;eems my mi&s;tre&s;s has done too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A pretty &s;tory! So I am to come to make my complaint to you to a fine purpo&s;e; it &s;eems you think me in the wrong all the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed &s;o I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And what if I had come to you to be hired, and you had a&s;ked me my opinion about religion, and I had an&s;we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> you, that I had not had many thoughts about it: that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> opinions were alike to me: that when I did go any where, I would go where you would have me go, and the like?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Mary, I mu&s;t own I &s;hould not like it at all; neither, I believe, &s;hould I hire you at all. I &s;hould be afraid to take &s;uch a &s;tupid de&s;pi&s;er of God and religion into my hou&s;e; you &s;hould e'en go without a mi&s;tre&s;s for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, and you might go without a &s;ervant too for me; for I can tell you there are mi&s;tre&s;&s;es enough in the world that never a&s;k <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> que&s;tion either before or after, nor care whether their &s;ervants &s;erve God or the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, Mary, and that is the rea&s;on why &s;o many of us &s;ervants are of the &s;ame kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I don't doubt, however, but I &s;hall get a place among them, and not be que&s;tioned about going to church. I go to &s;ervice to work, not to learn my cate|chi&s;m; I under&s;tand my cookery, what is it to them whe|ther I under&s;tand religion or no?</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, look you, Mary, I don't learn my cate|chi&s;m any more than you, and yet I do not like my mi&s;|tre&s;s

the wor&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you, for taking care that her &s;ervants &s;hould go to church, and not caring to keep tho&s;e that are de&s;pi&s;ers of religion. I think 'tis a pity any lady that is religious &s;hould not have religious &s;ervants about her.</P>
<P>[They had another dialogue upon this &s;ubject after|wards: but it had too much pa&s;&s;ion in it to merit a place in this account; for the ca&s;e was this; Betty gave her lady an account of &s;ome part of Mary's di&s;cour&s;e, parti|cularly that of making a je&s;t of her chaplain, and of cal|ling the family to prayers: upon which her mi&s;tre&s;s turn|ed her out of her hou&s;e, giving her a month's wages in|&s;tead of a month's warning as one not fit to be allowed to &s;tay in her family; and Mary fell upon her fellow &s;ervant for that part in a great rage. Betty told her in &s;o many words, &s;he thought her&s;elf obliged to mention it, though it was not till her mi&s;tre&s;s, having heard that they had di&s;|cour&s;ed together, made her promi&s;e to give her a full ac|count of all that had pa&s;&s;ed between them, and if &s;he had not done it faithfully, her mi&s;tre&s;s would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them both away together.</P>
<P>The&s;e two &s;hort dialogues or di&s;putes about the maid's rambling on the Sabbath-day, was the rea&s;on why the young lady's aunt was willing to di&s;cour&s;e again with her niece upon that &s;ubject; and accordingly meeting toge|ther &s;ome time after, they renewed their di&s;cour&s;e about &s;ervants in the following manner.]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, niece, when you and I talked la&s;t, we were upon the &s;ubject of taking religious &s;ervants: I want to hear what you have to &s;ay upon that head; for I think there is really much more in it than mo&s;t people imagine.</P>

<P>As the world goes now, child, it will be very hard to find &s;uch; for religion is &s;o much made a je&s;t of among ma&s;ters, that it is hard to find any &s;ervants that do not je&s;t at it too, and mock and &s;light all tho&s;e that have any regard to it.</P>

<P>I believe &s;o, Madam. But this is one particu|lar ca&s;e, and which I have the greater rea&s;on to take notice of, becau&s;e a certain lady, and acquaintance and neigh|bour of mine, has had a great deal of that kind; and in|deed in a particular manner with her &s;ervants.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it very well; and we talked a little upon that very &s;ubject; I mean, how rude and in&s;olent &s;ervants were grown at this time: but I think we had not much talk of their being irreligious and profane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, &s;he had a &s;ervant, whom they called her woman; for &s;he was one to whom &s;he entru&s;ted every thing, and who was like a hou&s;e-keeper; and all the &s;ervants were as it were under her: &s;he was a very good &s;ort of a body indeed in the hou&s;e; and as that lady, if you remember, was very lame, &s;he could not &s;tir about to look much after her &s;ervants her&s;elf, but tru&s;ted all to this woman.</P>
<P>She was a &s;en&s;ible woman, had the knowledge of almo&s;t every thing in the world, and talked admirably well; had a world of wit and humour, very mannerly and well behaved, &s;ober and mode&s;t enough; in &s;hort, &s;he was an excellent &s;ervant.</P>

<P>In a word, Madam, &s;he had every thing about her, that could be de&s;ired in a &s;ervant, but religion; and

of that &s;he was as entirely empty as you can imagine it po&s;&s;ible for any creature in the world to be, and that had ever heard of God or the devil, or had lived among Chri&s;tians.</P>

<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, niece, you &s;ay &s;he was not an ignorant body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, indeed, Madam, &s;he was &s;o far from be|ing ignorant, that &s;he was able to deceive any body: &s;he would talk of religious things as well, and argue upon them &s;trongly enough to delude any body: and this made it the wor&s;e, for &s;he was &s;uch a human devil, that &s;he made u&s;e of a fluent tongue, and of an uncommon wit, not to talk irreligiou&s;ly only, but to mock and make a je&s;t of religion in general, and of all tho&s;e that had any regard for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>She was a dangerous body indeed! Pray, was &s;he a maid or a wife? for &s;he is not very young it &s;eems.</P>
</SP>

<P>She had never been married, Madam, but I think was engaged to a man whom my &s;pou&s;e &s;ent to Ita|ly: and they are to be married when he comes back.</P>

<P>Yes, madam, he has very often, and told her &s;uch particulars as are very e&s;&s;ential to the good of the family; and &s;uch too as almo&s;t carry their own evidence with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what does &s;he &s;ay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not indeed how &s;he manages; but I know that her hu&s;band and &s;he have had more words a|bout it, than about all other matters put together, &s;ince they were married; and &s;ometimes it grows high, and they are very warm, and even angry about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;he &s;eems to be a good &s;en&s;ible, religious lady: how can &s;he take &s;uch a creature's par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, e&s;pecially again&s;t her hu&s;band!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, fir&s;t of all, &s;he pretends that &s;he does not believe it; that the other &s;ervants rival her in the favours &s;he receives, and her mi&s;tre&s;s' particular kindne&s;&s;es, and do it out of a malicious de&s;ign: than &s;he &s;ays &s;he has examined her, and &s;he finds &s;he clears her&s;elf of much of the charge, and makes the re&s;t appear to be trifling, and not worth notice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But perhaps, niece, it really may be &s;o too, and the other &s;ervants may make things wor&s;e than they are, for the rea&s;ons you mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, madam, it is otherwi&s;e in fact; for the truth is, the wench, or woman, manages all the &s;ervants &s;o effectually, that, in &s;hort, if any of them are religiou&s;ly inclined when they come, &s;he makes them a&s;hamed to be &s;o, when they come to her; for &s;he makes &s;uch a meek of religion, and &s;uch a je&s;t of going to church, or going to prayers in the family, that &s;he laughs them out of their religion, and, in a word, they all turn reprobates like her|&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can this be, and her lady not know or hear of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, very well, madam; for, as I told you, &s;he is an excellent &s;ervant, and the more her mi&s;tre&s;s is loth to part with her, the harder &s;he is to believe the&s;e things of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But niece, her hu&s;band, you &s;ay, knows it; &s;ure &s;he will believe him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="246" REF="025384_0245_0FCD11AA6AB810D0">
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he alledges, he knows it but by hear &s;ay from the re&s;t of the &s;ervants, who, &s;he &s;ays, hates her, and therefore fal&s;ely accu&s;es her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does he know nothing from his own know|ledge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam, he knows too much; for the un|wary creature let him over-hear her one evening, making her jeers, and flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t at him to &s;ome of the &s;ervants, but be|hind his back, for his calling them all to prayers; and not only &s;o, but at &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which he had u&s;ed &s;ome time or other, which &s;he pretended were non&s;en&s;e, and others trifling, and the like, as the redundancy of her wit gave her room to banter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was very unhappy indeed, and the wor&s;e that he &s;hould know it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it was, madam; for it made the poor gen|tleman decline performing his duty for &s;ome time, and made a very great breach between him and his lady, which is hardly quite made up yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, madam, &s;he wanted to have him conti|nue to go on with his duty, and to pray in his family as he u&s;ed to do; he declared he could not do it while that crea|ture was to be there; that it was a re&s;traint to him, and he could not perform when he knew there was one in the place who made a &s;coff and jeer at him for it.</P>
<P>She alledged, he ought to perform his duty for all that: and that it was a piece of the devil's craft, contrived to interrupt the wor&s;hip of God in his family, and that he ought to di&s;regard it entirely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I think he was very much in the wrong in that part; for he certainly ought not to have omitted his duty upon &s;o mean an objection as that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, and he owned it; but &s;aid it was a difficulty upon him, a re&s;traint to him in the perform|ance of his duty, and that &s;he ought to remove it from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>He ought to have con&s;idered, that the le&s;s of religion was to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in his &s;ervants, the more rea&s;on he had to pray for them, and with them; that he might perhaps be the occa&s;ion of good to them; and of bringing
<PB N="247" REF="025384_0246_0FCD11ABF71AE730">
them to the knowledge and love of religion, which would be an advantage he ought to be thankful for, and think it a ble&s;&s;ing to his hou&s;e if it happened &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>She did argue ju&s;t &s;o to him, madam: but he returned it &s;o &s;trong upon her, that &s;he ought, as far as lay in her, to remove every difficulty that lay in the way of his duty, that it was much more forcible as to her; for he told her, that if &s;he granted, that the difficulty was a &s;nare laid in his way by the devil, &s;he ought, at the &s;ame time, that &s;he told him it was his duty to re&s;i&s;t it, do all &s;he could po&s;&s;ible, or that lay in her power, to re|move the occa&s;ion; otherwi&s;e &s;he made her&s;elf acce&s;&s;ary to the temptation, and a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the devil, in laying a &s;nare for her hu&s;band, and much of the &s;in would lie at her door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a great deal in that, I confe&s;s: and I think &s;he ought to have yielded immediately. Pray, what did &s;he &s;ay to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>She in&s;i&s;ted that the charge was fal&s;e; that her woman denied it, and, as I &s;aid before, that it was a ma|licious de&s;ign of the other &s;ervants; but, in &s;hort, the bu|&s;ine&s;s was, that &s;he was very loth to part with her woman, who, as I &s;aid before, was a very good &s;ervant, and u&s;eful to her divers ways.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you &s;aid, that he heard &s;omething of it him&s;elf. Surely &s;he would believe him then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;he could &s;ay nothing to that indeed: but &s;he put it off as well as &s;he could, with telling him &s;he would tell her woman of it, and take care &s;he &s;hould do &s;o no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That &s;eemed to be trifling, becau&s;e it was in a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence, as ought not to be trifled with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was &s;o: but he went yet further; he en|treated her, he begged of her to take away a thing &s;o irk&s;ome from him, and which was &s;o much a hinderance to his duty. He told her, that had a &s;ervant been a mere ignorant, untaught creature, he &s;hould have no difficul|ty upon him, but rather it would be an encouragement to do his duty, in hopes of being an in&s;trument of open|ing their eyes: but, for a mocker at religion, and one
<PB N="248" REF="025384_0247_0FCD11AEADE2C7C8">
that not only de&s;pi&s;ed religion it&s;elf, but mocked at others for it: this made the ca&s;e differ exceedingly, and he knew not how to get over it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would not &s;uch arguments as the&s;e move her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, not &s;o much as they &s;hould have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, what was the con&s;equence of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, madam, the con&s;equences were bad many ways For, fir&s;t, it kept the lady and her hu&s;band in very ill terms with one another for near two years. And, &s;econdly, that unhappy creature bantered all the other &s;ervants of the family out of the little religion they had, and indeed made them all like her&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where did it end?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, madam, be&s;ides this, it broke and put an end to all good order, and to the wor&s;hip of God in the family; I mean, to all family wor&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What dreadful work was that! What! and does it continue &s;o &s;till?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam. Her hu&s;band, who is a very religious gentleman, could not content him&s;elf with living in that manner with his family, and not being able to prevail with his wife to part with her woman, he took &s;o much upon him as to force her out of the hou&s;e, that is to &s;ay, he put away the whole &s;et of &s;ervants in the family; for they were all made alike at la&s;t, and took all new peo|ple at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how did the lady take it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, madam, I cannot &s;ay &s;he took it &s;o well as I wi&s;h, for her &s;ake, &s;he had: for though her hu&s;band and &s;he are very religious, &s;ober, and good people, yet I cannot but &s;ay, it has broken very much in upon their tempers and affection one to another, and there is not all the harmony between them that there u&s;ed to be.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE II.</HEAD>
<P>IN the evening, the lady and her niece taking a walk in the garden, had a farther conver&s;ation upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, and the niece &s;aid to her aunt, which began the dialogue, madam, when we left off our di&s;cour&s;e in the morning, you were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, at the end of my &s;tory of an irreligious, profane wench, that my neighbour Mrs.&mdash;had been troubled with, that you would tell me a &s;tory of another.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did &s;o, child: it is of a family that lives at [She points to a hou&s;e that could be &s;een over the garden wall] that hou&s;e, ju&s;t over the way, in the back lane. The people are Di&s;&s;enters; the gentlewoman is a very &s;ober, religious, good &s;ort of a per&s;on indeed; and her hu&s;band is a very grave, religious man al&s;o. They endea|vour to take &s;ervants of their own per&s;ua&s;ion as much as they can; but that is &s;ometimes very difficult to do; and &s;he has indeed had very bad luck that way. However, this gentlewoman, as &s;he told me her&s;elf, having occa&s;ion to hire a maid &s;ervant, I forgot whether &s;he was a cook or chamber maid, or what el&s;e, for they kept three or four: but after &s;he had agreed in every thing el&s;e, &s;he a&s;ked her maid (that was to be) what religion &s;he was of?</P>
<P>Madam, &s;ays the maid blu&s;hing (for &s;he looked migh|ty &s;ober) that is a que&s;tion I do not under&s;tand very well.</P>
<P>Why, &s;ays the mi&s;tre&s;s, I hope you are a Prote&s;tant; I do not mean, whether you are a Papi&s;t or no.</P>
<P>Yes, madam, &s;ays the maid, I think I am a Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;ays the mi&s;tre&s;s, do you think &s;o? but then, I doubt you do not think much about it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really, madam, I have had two or three that made a great deal of difficulty to do it, and thought it very much out of the way to have me a&s;k them about it.</P>

<P>It may be po&s;&s;ible indeed that a wench may be a good &s;ervant, that is not a good Chri&s;tian; but I mu&s;t acknowledge it is but very &s;eldom that it proves &s;o; but when a good &s;ervant is a good Chri&s;tian too, &s;uch a one is ten times the more valuable for a &s;ervant, as well as for her religion.</P>

<P>It is true, madam. But what &s;hall we &s;ay, that &s;ome that are good Chri&s;tians, are neverthele&s;s not good &s;ervants: nay, there is a kind of a &s;candal upon tho&s;e we call religious &s;ervants, that they are generally &s;aucy, re&s;erved, and value them&s;elves too upon it, always making conditions with you, and claiming times and liber|ties on account of religious affairs, which are neither pro|per for the work of religion, nor perhaps employed &s;o, when granted.</P>

<P>That was to &s;ay, &s;he was perfectly indifferent in the matter, and it would have been the &s;ame thing to her, if her mi&s;tre&s;s had been a Church-woman, or a Ro|man Catholic, or a Jew, or any thing, or nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But her mi&s;tre&s;s did not take it &s;o; but &s;eemed &s;atisfied, that &s;he agreed to go to the meeting, and &s;o took her into the hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, madam, what came of it? how did &s;he prove?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ju&s;t as a poor, uneducated, ignorant crea|ture would prove. She went with them to the meeting, but pretended to the &s;ervants &s;he did not like it, and &s;he had rather go to the church. So her mi&s;tre&s;s, taking an opportunity of talking with her again one day, told her what &s;he had heard in the hou&s;e of her, and a&s;ked her, if &s;he had &s;aid, that &s;he did not like going to the meetings, but had rather go to church; and &s;he &s;aid, that indeed &s;he did &s;ay &s;o, but &s;he meant nothing of harm.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays her mi&s;tre&s;s, I never de&s;ire to offer violence to any &s;ervant's con&s;cience; if you had rather go to church, you &s;hall go to church, though you know what
<PB N="254" REF="025384_0253_0FCD11B8E716BE90">
you &s;aid to me, when I hired you, that you were very wil|ling to go to the meeting.</P>
<P>That was very true, &s;he &s;aid, and &s;he had not &s;aid otherwi&s;e now; but &s;he &s;aid only, that &s;he had rather go to church: However, if &s;he plea&s;ed, &s;he would &s;tay at home.</P>
<P>No, no, &s;ays the mi&s;tre&s;s, I'll have no &s;taying at home; I will have all my &s;ervants go to the public wor&s;hip of God &s;omewhere: &s;taying at home may be as much mi&s;pending the &s;abbath-day, as going abroad for plea&s;ure: therefore go to church, Betty, &s;ays her mi&s;tre&s;s, by all means; I am not &s;o much again&s;t going to church, as to think that they do not &s;erve and wor&s;hip God there. By all means, if you do not care to go to the meeting, go to church; 'tis certainly your duty to go &s;omewhere, and mine to oblige you to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was &s;poken like a woman of very good principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is a very good &s;ort of a per&s;on, I a&s;&s;ure you, and generally governs her&s;elf upon good principles, prin|ciples of ju&s;tice and of charity, which is a great part of religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, pray what followed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;he went to church, as &s;he &s;aid; but in a little while her mi&s;tre&s;s began to &s;u&s;pect her: and once or twice &s;he betrayed her&s;elf, and di&s;covered among the &s;ervants that &s;he had been rambling about, but had not been at church at all. Upon this &s;u&s;picion, her mi&s;tre&s;s told her one day very calmly, that &s;he had &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that her &s;aying &s;he had rather go to church than to the meeting, was not a &s;incere di&s;like, or approving of the one more than of the other, but really a project of her own to have the liberty of &s;pending the Sabbath-day no where; that is to &s;ay, in running about, as &s;he had been &s;uffered to do, when &s;he was at home with her father and mother.</P>
<P>She replied with &s;ome confidence, that indeed it was not &s;o, and began to be more po&s;itive about her having been at church than her mi&s;tre&s;s de&s;ired &s;he &s;hould be, becau&s;e &s;he knew &s;he told her what was fal&s;e. How|ever, &s;he run on, told her mi&s;tre&s;s a lie or two, which &s;he
<PB N="255" REF="025384_0254_0FCD11BA23842DA8">
knew to be &s;o; and in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he de&s;ired to go to church, becau&s;e &s;he liked to &s;erve God in that way better than the other. So her mi&s;tre&s;s let it pa&s;s for that time, and &s;he went to church as u&s;ual, that is to &s;ay, went where &s;he plea&s;ed for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>At la&s;t &s;he was trapped accidentally, and could not get off any manner of way. For, going rambling for her plea&s;ure with &s;ome of the neighbouring &s;ervants, men and maids together (for by this time &s;he had got a gang like her&s;elf) and going to cro&s;s the road about a mile from the town, a citizen that was &s;pending the Sabbath-day on hor&s;eback, as &s;he was &s;pending it on foot, I mean in plea&s;ure, coming ju&s;t up at that minute, his hor&s;e &s;tarted at &s;omething, I know not at what, and giving a &s;pring forward, ran again&s;t the poor wench, beat her down and threw him off a little farther, and hurt him too very much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what became of the poor girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;he was more frighted than any thing el&s;e; but &s;he had a kick or brui&s;e by the hor&s;e on her knee, or the hor&s;e trod on her knee, &s;he could not tell which. But by that means &s;he was lamed, and could not get home till about eight o'clock at night, when her mi&s;|tre&s;s, coming to the knowledge of it, &s;ent the coach for her, and brought her home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there was a full di&s;covery indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, &s;o there was; for the neighbour's &s;ervants that were with her, owned where they had been, and with whom: and told hone&s;tly that they had been at a cake-hou&s;e to be merry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was no crime perhaps in the families where they lived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, none at all; or at lea&s;t no notice was taken of it, e&s;pecially &s;ince they were only with neighbours, and, as they called it, were in no bad company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what did &s;he do with her maid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why her maid was the &s;ame; &s;he was &s;orry for a while, and pretended &s;he would never go abroad for plea&s;ure again on a Sabbath-day. But that held but a little while; &s;he was the &s;ame again a little while after; &s;o her mi&s;tre&s;s re&s;olved to part with her, for &s;he two or
<PB N="256" REF="025384_0255_0FCD11BDF1DF9400">
three times enticed the other &s;ervants to go abroad with her, and &s;till when they had been mi&s;&s;ed, the an&s;wer was, they went to church with Betty; and then if Bet|ty was a&s;ked, &s;he would lie very readily too, and &s;ay yes. At la&s;t this came out too, and Betty was called to an account for it, and when &s;he could deny it no longer, then &s;he would own it, but promi&s;e to alter it, and do &s;o no more. At length her mi&s;tre&s;s, who was in a little &s;trait &s;till, and loth to put any force upon the wench a|bout going to the meeting, told her &s;he could not bear the&s;e things, and gave her warning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was time to part with her, when &s;he found &s;he &s;poiled the re&s;t of the &s;ervants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but the wench, very loth to leave a good place, came to her mi&s;tre&s;s, and begged her to let her &s;tay, and &s;he would go to the meeting, and then &s;he &s;hould be &s;ure &s;he did not ramble any more on the Sab|bath-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that 'twas plain &s;he would &s;erve God any way for a good place; and that was what I &s;aid of her as &s;oon as I heard her fir&s;t an&s;wer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But her mi&s;tre&s;s acted upon another principle &s;till, and &s;he refu&s;ed her: No, &s;ays &s;he, Betty, you de|clared in the hou&s;e that you u&s;ed to go to church; that you did not like the meeting, and that you had rather go to church. Now, I will not have any body forced from going to church, to plea&s;e me; if you had been one that was bred to go to the meeting, I had been better plea&s;ed, becau&s;e I have been &s;o brought up my&s;elf; but if you chu&s;e to go to church, becau&s;e you like to &s;erve God after that manner, better than in the way I go, God forbid I &s;hould put any force upon you. I doubt not, but you may &s;erve and wor&s;hip God very accepta|bly either way; but if you go to the meeting, which you do not like, 'tis only to keep your place which you do like, 'tis plain to me you will wor&s;hip God no where; for you cannot be &s;aid to wor&s;hip God in a way you do not like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was too nice, I think, and talk'd to an ignorant wench in language that &s;he did not under&s;tand;
<PB N="257" REF="025384_0256_0FCD11BF6CA53AD0">
&s;he might e'en have let her gone any where: for 'twas plain &s;he would &s;erve God no where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, &s;he acted on her principles, however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what did &s;he do with the maid then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;he made her a new propo&s;al. Look-ye Bett, &s;ays her Mi&s;tre&s;s, if you will go to church hone&s;t|ly, and &s;atisfy me that you do &s;o, and that you do not under a pretence of going to church, go abroad and &s;pend your time idly, I &s;hall be ea&s;y; for this was all the rea&s;on why at fir&s;t I a&s;k'd you where you went, and told you I expected you &s;hould go with me; not that I am again&s;t any body's going to the church, but becau&s;e I de&s;ire they &s;hould &s;erve God, and not ramble abroad. Betty promi&s;ed heartily; ay, but &s;ays her mi&s;tre&s;s, how &s;hall I be &s;atisfied of the performance? Betty &s;tood hard to have her word to be taken for it; but that would not do, becau&s;e &s;he had broke her promi&s;e before, and had told &s;ome lies too about the other &s;ervants' going to church with her, as above. Well, Betty, &s;ays her mi&s;|tre&s;s, I'll put you in a way to &s;atisfy me effectually: you know the clerk of the pari&s;h lives ju&s;t by, and in your way to the church; his wife is a very good, &s;ober woman, and I know never fails of going to church, if &s;he be well. Now, if you will go every Sunday with her, I'll an&s;wer for it, that if you are not there &s;he will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to me, and &s;o kind to you, as to tell me of it; and this &s;hall &s;a|tisfy me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the clerk's wife was &s;o faithful to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, it was right; but that was a doubtful thing; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> would be loth, I reckon, to ruin the poor wench for fail|ing now and then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, the &s;hort of the &s;tory was this; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was Betty &s;till: and ill habit, and want of principle, led her away; &s;he &s;eldom came to church, and the clerk's wife would lie for her, and &s;o at la&s;t her mi&s;tre&s;s turned her away: and thus I think all &s;ervants, men and maids, &s;hould be &s;erved, would the ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es do their duty; and, if this was univer&s;ally practi&s;ed, &s;er|vants would &s;erve God and their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es too, better than they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>They would &s;o indeed, and for want of it,
<PB N="258" REF="025384_0257_0FCD11C113DC1758">
they &s;erve neither God nor their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. 'Tis a want of a religious regard to the well ordering of &s;ervants that makes them as they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I have another &s;tory to tell you, of the &s;ame gentlewoman: for after this &s;he took a &s;ervant that &s;he thought mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be religious; for &s;he was bred to the meetings from her infancy: but &s;he told her where &s;he u&s;ed to go, and capitulated for liberty to go to the &s;ame meeting &s;till. This her mi&s;tre&s;s readily con&s;ent|ed to, not doubting, but that one, that was under &s;uch obligations, would certainly be careful to do her duty; and when &s;he mentioned to the maid that &s;he was very ready to yield to her going where &s;he &s;aid &s;he went, that &s;he only de&s;ired to be &s;atisfied that her &s;ervants did really go where they &s;aid they went; the maid &s;eemed a little &s;urprized, that &s;he &s;hould be thought capable of &s;o wick|ed a thing as that, and &s;o &s;topped her mi&s;tre&s;s' mouth with her character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, then I hope &s;he had one to her mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the &s;ame time her hu&s;band had a man-&s;er|vant who was a very religious, devout fellow, and he was a church-man: he truly conditioned, that he would be at liberty to go to church, which, upon their being &s;atisfied that he was really a well-meaning, &s;ober, and &s;erious fel|low, they ea&s;ily con&s;ented to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you &s;aid they in&s;i&s;ted on their &s;er|vants going to wor&s;hip God where they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you they de&s;ired it, but that it was chiefly that they might be &s;ure to have orderly &s;ervants; and that they did ob&s;erve the Lord's day, and wor&s;hip|ped God in &s;ome place or other, not mi&s;-&s;pending the Sabbath; otherwi&s;e they were per&s;ons of large charity, and of a true Chri&s;tian temper to tho&s;e from whom they differed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but to return to their &s;ervants, how did they prove?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only the wor&s;t that ever were heard of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! both of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, both of them. The wench was &s;aucy, rigid, cen&s;orious; took upon her to find fault, that her
<PB N="259" REF="025384_0258_0FCD11C261758570">
ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, who were cheerful and good temper|ed people, were not &s;erious enough; &s;he would not come into their family-wor&s;hip, becau&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, 'tis &s;orrily performed, and &s;he did not like it: when her mi&s;tre&s;s en|tertained any friends, &s;he did not like it, 'twas wicked, and it was loo&s;e and extravagant, and had too much lux|ury in it, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>She &s;hould have been mi&s;tre&s;s, and not maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her mi&s;tre&s;s told her &s;o indeed one day, when over-hearing &s;ome of her talk by an accident, &s;he cal|led her to her, and &s;peaking &s;omething angrily to her, Jane &s;ays &s;he, an&s;wer me one que&s;tion: What did I hire you for? Jane was a little &s;urprized at fir&s;t, not under&s;tanding the que&s;tion, and &s;aid nothing, till her mi&s;tre&s;s repeated the que&s;tion by way of explanation thus, Jane, pray did I hire you to do my work and to be my &s;ervant?</P>
<P>Yes, madam, &s;ays Jane.</P>
<P>Well then, &s;ays her mi&s;tre&s;s, pray do your bu&s;ine&s;s, and behave like a &s;ervant, as becomes you, or remove and provide your&s;elf; and, when I want a &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s to teach me how to behave in my family, I'll &s;end for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was right; that was acting like a mi&s;|tre&s;s; pray, what &s;aid Jane to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was confounded, and &s;truck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> fir&s;t; but her mi&s;tre&s;s explained it to her afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, what was &s;he for a &s;ervant!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! A mo&s;t extraordinary accompli&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and a &s;urly, heavy, unmannerly creature, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> always as if &s;he thought her&s;elf fitter to be mi&s;tre&s;s, than her that was &s;o; did every thing with reluctance auk ward and di&s;re&s;pectful, and yet wilful and above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> taught, dull to the la&s;t degree, but &s;corned reproof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly &s;he had more of the pretence to re|ligion than of the reality; for Chri&s;tianity teaches us to fill up every relative duty with equal exactne&s;s, and with a &s;uitable diligence and application.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to bring my &s;tory to a point, &s;he had the out&s;ide of religion only: Whether &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it up with a de&s;ign to deceive, or whether &s;he deceived her|&s;elf, and fell from what &s;he at fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ed, I know
<PB N="260" REF="025384_0259_0FCD11C70D6E1858">
not, but &s;he fell quite off from religion it&s;elf at la&s;t; and adding to that &s;ome follies, which I chu&s;e to &s;ay no|thing of, my good neighbour turned her off, and got rid of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece</SPEAKER>
<P>There &s;he was cheated in her own way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt</SPEAKER>
<P>She was &s;o, and I told her of it; but &s;he an|&s;wered me with a &s;aying which I have often made u&s;e of before, and that with relation to my&s;elf; I am never, &s;aid &s;he, in &s;o much danger to be cheated, as when people pretend to be religious&punc; for then I think they dare not do &s;uch things as I am afraid of.</P>
<P>[Here the &s;econd &s;i&s;ter came into the room, and find|ing what di&s;cour&s;e they were engaged in, after her re|&s;pects paid to her aunt, and to her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he de&s;ired they would go on with their di&s;cour&s;e, for that &s;he knew the &s;ubject, and it was what &s;he came on purpo&s;e to have a &s;hare in.]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was telling your &s;i&s;ter, how a lady of my ac|quaintance was cheated with two religious &s;ervants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard the la&s;t part; and &s;he was a nice one indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! I have not told you one half of her beha|viour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but madam, how did it fare with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ervant? how did he behave?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why every jot as ill another way: When he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be at hand to be called, and when his ma&s;ter want|ed him upon any occa&s;ion, he was gone to church to pray|ers; and when prayers were done, he would often fall in, as he came home, at a certain ale-hou&s;e that unhappily &s;tood in the way home, and I think, once or twice came home drunk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine things indeed for a con&s;cientious wretch? the&s;e were religious &s;ervants, it &s;eems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, niece! Religion, no nor any profe&s;&s;ion or opinion in religion is not altered one way or other, by the mi&s;takes or mi&s;carriages of tho&s;e that make a profe&s;&s;ion of it. The eleven ble&s;&s;ed apo&s;tles were not at all the wor&s;e, nor is the memory of them to be the le&s;s re|verenced, for the twelfth being a devil; nor mu&s;t we ex|pect that all our &s;ervants &s;hall be &s;aints, when they are
<PB N="261" REF="025384_0260_0FCD11C86737A470">
what we call religious: All people have failings, religion does not always change natural tempers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we &s;hould expect they &s;hould be Chri&s;tians, and &s;ervants too. Religion never takes away good manners, or privileges &s;ervants from ob&s;erving the due &s;pace which nature hath put between the per&s;on to be &s;erved, and the per&s;on &s;erving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great thing I in&s;i&s;t upon taking re|ligious &s;ervants for, is, that they may be examples in a family, of &s;obriety, quietne&s;s, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, diligence and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, to their fellow-&s;ervants; that they may be encouragers, not hinderers of God's wor&s;hip in the hou&s;e, that the whole family may cheerfully unite in &s;erving God, and in all religious rules and orders; that if an ignorant and untaught creature is taken into the hou&s;e, they may be in&s;tructed and led by the hand into the pro|per duties of a Chri&s;tian: that all the hou&s;e may be a cla&s;s of Chri&s;tians, doing their duty in their re&s;pective places, both from a principle of ju&s;tice and charity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But 'tis very rare, niece, to find what you &s;peak of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is &s;o, Madam: But then, &s;ince it is not probable we &s;hould always find &s;uch, all that I in&s;i&s;t on in the mean time is, that we &s;hould take care, as near as po&s;&s;ible, to take tho&s;e who are well inclined, and well educated: Not enemies to all religion, nor &s;uch as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> a mock of wor&s;hipping their Maker, or ob&s;erving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rules; &s;uch I would not entertain at all, on any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what&s;oever; they would be a continual offence in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> family.</P>

<P>Indeed, Madam, I am po&s;itive in that point; I cannot go from it.

<P>No! my dear! The ca&s;e is plain; we mu&s;t not let &s;ervants laugh us out of our religion: We mu&s;t

go on in the way of our duty, and &s;et up the wor&s;hip of God in the hou&s;e; and as often as we find the &s;ervants flout at it, or contemn it, return the contempt upon them&s;elves, and turn them out, but go on to perform the duty: Turn them all away, that pretend to behave irreverently, or pretend to mock or &s;coff at it; I &s;ay, turn them all away, and let it be the &s;tanding known rule in the family, that all the &s;ervants that come, may hear of it as &s;oon as they conver&s;e in the hou&s;e; then they will know what they have to tru&s;t to, and will be|have accordingly. 'Tis omitting our duty in our fami|lies, not our performing it, that makes &s;ervants mock. When they &s;ee us religious to day and wicked to-mor|row, they may well &s;coff; but where &s;erious religion is &s;teadily maintained in a family, it commands that awe and reverence of &s;ervants, that they grow religious of cour&s;e. Thus one good family breeds good &s;ervants for another, and the good example of a &s;ober family makes the &s;ervants all &s;ober.</P>

For example, a cook comes and hires her&s;elf to me, to &s;erve as &s;uch; and when &s;he has undertaken the bu&s;ine&s;s, it appears &s;he under&s;tands no|thing of cookery, and has never been any thing but a middle maid, to wa&s;h and &s;crub the rooms, and the like: Or, a chamber-maid offers her&s;elf, and tells me &s;he knows how to make mantuas, cut hair, clear &s;tarch, and the like; and, when it comes to the trial, acknow|leges &s;he does not under&s;tand any of them, or only this, and not that, as it happens: Why &s;hould not this maid be puni&s;hed, as well as &s;he that pretending to be hone&s;t, proves a thief?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, child; &s;he does de&s;erve to be ill u&s;ed: But the ca&s;e differs as to a thief; for &s;he is puni&s;hed not for pretending hone&s;ty, and deceiving me in the cha|racter, but for her actual theft, and robbing me of my goods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, then the puni&s;hment &s;hould differ too. I do not &s;ay &s;he &s;hould be hanged, but I think &s;he &s;hould be puni&s;hed however &s;ome way or other.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have ways to puni&s;h &s;uch a &s;ervant, and all &s;ervants too, if all mi&s;tre&s;&s;es would be but ju&s;t to them&s;elves, and to one another.

<P>Why, Madam, whenever any &s;uch &s;er|vant came to me, I would be &s;ure to turn her away a|gain, with all the re&s;entment that her behaviour requir|ed; and when &s;he &s;ent any future mi&s;tre&s;s to me for a character, I would do her ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>You carry the ca&s;e a great deal too high, &s;i&s;ter; I cannot think that they are alike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Truly, &s;i&s;ter, I think 'tis much the &s;ame; but of the two here is the greater obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I take your notion right, niece; the obligation is this: If I take the thief and give him up to the law, he is undone, and his life mu&s;t pay for it; and 'tis a &s;ad thing for me to let a poor fellow be put to death, or tran&s;ported, for robbing me of a trifle: But, on the other hand, I am to con&s;ider, 1. I am obliged by the law to do it; that it is not I that put him to death, but the laws of his country, and his own crime is the cau&s;e of it; and I am an offender again&s;t that very law, and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e a confederate with him, at lea&s;t an encourager of him in his crime, if I omit it. But which is more than that, 2. By my perharps un&s;ea&s;onable and indeed unju&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, become acce&s;&s;ery to all the robberies he &s;hall be guilty of after it; becau&s;e if I had done as the law directed me, I had put him out of a condition to rob or injure any other per&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have fully explained my meaning, madam, and I take the ca&s;e to be the &s;ame; I by no means do as I ought, or as the law directs, if when my neighbour taking a &s;ervant after me, and coming to me for a character of her, I decline &s;peaking the truth of her, ay, and the whole truth too.</P>

<P>Not only &s;o, madam, but we do as we would not be done by; for would any of us, if we go to inquire of a &s;ervant, be told &s;he was hone&s;t, when &s;he was a thief; that &s;he was neat, when &s;he was na&s;ty; tight, when &s;he was a &s;lattern; diligent, when &s;he was idle; quiet when &s;he was &s;aucy; and mode&s;t, when &s;he was it may be, a bold hu&s;&s;y and the like.</P>

<P>I ob&s;erve, indeed, there is a general backward|ne&s;s in people whenever we go to inquire about a &s;er|vant. A mi&s;tre&s;s cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;uppo&s;ed to recommend earn|e&s;tly, becau&s;e it is to be granted that &s;he parted with the &s;ervant, for &s;omething or other.

<P>It would not only an&s;wer the end, madam, as to the law part, but it would bring &s;ervants back to be &s;ervants again, as they u&s;ed to be, and as they ought to be; for really they can hardly be called &s;ervants now.</P>

<P>I will put an end to all that immediately, &s;i&s;ter: I do not mean that I &s;hould enter into a long ac|cu&s;ation of a &s;ervant, and give the hi&s;tory of her life; or that I would bla&s;t her for trifles, or give her an ill name, for not &s;uiting exactly to my temper.

<P>But what was the per&s;on that &s;ent or recom|mended her? Did &s;he know her?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, I &s;uppo&s;e, did not know much of her own knowledge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam, but the maid gave me an account where &s;he had lived la&s;t, and I went to the lady, and I told her I came to enquire of &s;uch a maid &s;ervant, who, as &s;he had &s;aid, had lived with her. Yes, &s;he told me, &s;he had lived with her.</P>
<P>Pray, how long did &s;he live with you, madam, &s;aid I?</P>
<P>Pray, madam, how long does &s;he &s;ay &s;he lived with me? &s;ays &s;he.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t a year, madam, &s;ays I; I think it wanted but a month or thereabouts: at which &s;he made a kind of a hum, and &s;aid nothing for a while.</P>
<P>Now I did not like the way of an&s;wering my que&s;tion with a que&s;tion; for I thought &s;he might have told me po&s;itively how long the maid had lived with her, and
<PB N="274" REF="025384_0273_0FCD11E1E22EBB80">
left me to judge whether &s;he had &s;poken truth: Where|as, by returning the que&s;tion upon me, &s;he kept it in her own brea&s;t to accu&s;e or excu&s;e her. So I turned it &s;hort upon her. I hope, Madam, &s;ays I, you will be &s;o plain with me, as to let me know whether &s;he &s;ays true or not.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, Madam, &s;ays &s;he.</P>
<P>This &s;urpri&s;ed me again; for this had a double mean|ing as plain as could be, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to know whether &s;he meant, yes, that it was as the maid had &s;aid, or yes, that &s;he &s;hould let me know whether the maid had &s;aid true or not. So I &s;topped a while to give her time to go on, and explain him&s;elf; but finding &s;he did not, I repeated my que&s;tion. Pray, Madam, &s;ays I, be plea&s;ed to let me know exactly how long &s;he lived with you.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, not quite a year: The maid &s;ays true in that.</P>
<P>I was far from being &s;atisfied with that kind of an|&s;wer, the manner of drawing out her words &s;hewing me plainly that the wench had lied. However, le&s;t I &s;hould quarrel with her too &s;oon, and &s;o have no more out of her, I dropped it, and a&s;ked her &s;ome other que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Pray, Madam, &s;ays I, is &s;he a good work-woman?</P>
<P>Yes, yes, &s;ays &s;he, &s;he does her work well enough.</P>
<P>This was all equivocation again. Any body would have under&s;tood by my que&s;tion, that I enquired if &s;he was good at her needle; but &s;he would not take it as I meant it, and put it off with an an&s;wer which might be true, if the wench knew but how to make a bed, or &s;weep a room; &s;o I explained my&s;elf, and &s;aid, Madam, by a good work-woman, I mean at her needle, I hope you under&s;tand me.</P>
<P>Truly, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, I think &s;he is well enough, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> put her to much of that kind, having other hands in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Well, there &s;he came better off with me a little than before; but &s;till all this gave me no character of the maid; &s;o I went on.</P>
<P>Pray, Madam, &s;ays I, what do you &s;ay to her hon|e&s;ty? She is hone&s;t, I hope.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="025384_0274_0FCD11E360F84308">
I have no rea&s;on to tax her hone&s;ty, &s;ays &s;he, &s;he ne|ver wronged me of any thing that I know of; I charge her with nothing.</P>
<P>Even this was but a very indifferent way of vouching for a girl's hone&s;ty, and if &s;he was really hone&s;t, &s;he was not ju&s;t to her.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, &s;ays I, may I a&s;k you what was the occa&s;ion of your parting with her?</P>
<P>O, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, we parted indeed; &s;he and I could not agree; I am pa&s;&s;ionate and pretty trouble|&s;ome, and my maid and I could not hit it; but &s;he may do very well with another. Perhaps other mi&s;tre&s;&s;es may not be &s;o trouble&s;ome and difficult as I am; &s;he may do very well; I a&s;&s;ure you &s;he knows how to plea&s;e any bo|dy but me; &s;he told me &s;o her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was indeed provoked now, and an&s;wered, Madam, you are plea&s;ed to give your&s;elf &s;ome hard words; but I beg you will allow me to &s;ay, I did not come for a cha|racter of the maid's mi&s;tre&s;s, but a character of the maid; and I doubt, by your di&s;cour&s;e, you are willing to recommend your maid's character at the expence of your own.</P>
<P>She only &s;miled at me, when I &s;aid this, and &s;aid a|gain, &s;he was very difficult and ill to plea&s;e; but Betty might do very well with another.</P>
<P>I pre&s;&s;ed her again to let me know what &s;he parted with her maid for: but &s;till &s;he &s;huffled me off, and gave me the cunninge&s;t, eva&s;ive an&s;wers. Betty her&s;elf could not have put me off with half the dexterity as her mi&s;tre&s;s did; &s;o I made my honours as if I was going away.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;ays I, you are exceeding tender of your maid: but I cannot &s;ay you are equally ju&s;t to a &s;trang|er, that you &s;ee re&s;olved to depend upon your word for the character of a &s;ervant. However, I &s;hall take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the way I hope you intend it, namely, that though it may not be for the girl's advantage to have the particulars of her behaviour told; yet you would have me under|&s;tand by it, that her conduct will not bear a character, and that you would not have me venture upon her; and I &s;hall take your advice.</P>
<P>At this &s;he &s;eemed concerned, as if &s;he had expected
<PB N="276" REF="025384_0275_0FCD11E7A33EEF18">
that her aukward way of talking of the wench had &s;atis|fied me, and that I did not under&s;tand her; and as I of|fered to go, pray, Madam, &s;ays &s;he, don't &s;ay &s;o; Bet|ty may make you a very good &s;ervant; I am &s;orry you &s;hould take me &s;o; the maid may do very well in another place, though &s;he might not &s;uit me.</P>
<P>As I was talking, I ob&s;erved, that in the drawing-room to the room we &s;at in, there &s;at a gentleman read|ing in a great book, and every now and then he looked off his book, when his wife (for it was her hu&s;band) &s;poke, as if he was &s;urpri&s;ed at what &s;he &s;aid; and as the folding doors &s;tood wide open, &s;o that the rooms were as it were let both into one, he heard all we &s;aid, and I perceived that as he looked off his book when his wife &s;poke, &s;o he almo&s;t laugh'd outright when I &s;poke.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, as if he was not able to hold any longer, he clapp'd up the book pretty hard, and threw it by, and came forward into the room we were in, and making me a very low bow as he pa&s;&s;ed, he offered to go out; when his lady &s;tept up to him, and &s;aid &s;omething &s;oftly, which he an&s;wered &s;oftly, and with abundance of good-humour in his face, &s;aid to his wife, my dear, I will not interrupt you; upon which I offered to go away. By no means, Madam, &s;aid he, my bu&s;ine&s;s is of no moment. So taking hold of his wife's hand, he as it were turned her towards me, and at going away, my dear, &s;ays he, don't hold the lady in &s;u&s;pen&s;e about your maid, for I hear that is the bu&s;ine&s;s: Let her have a true character of her; you would be glad to be dealt plainly with your|&s;elf. His wife &s;miled, but &s;aid nothing at fir&s;t, but pre|&s;ently turning to him, and all in a plea&s;ant, good hu|mour, &s;he gave him a little tap on the arm with her hand: Do you give a character of her, if you think I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> done it well. Mu&s;t I? &s;ays he: Why then, Ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;ays he to me, with my wife's leave, &s;he is a damn'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a horrid &s;cold, a liar, and though &s;he has, I believe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nothing from us, was a thief in the place &s;he came la&s;t from, which we heard of &s;ince, and for that very thing my wife turned her away.</P>
<P>I made him a court&s;ey, and told him I was greatly o|bliged to him for &s;o much &s;incerity, and found his lady
<PB N="277" REF="025384_0276_0FCD11E8BAAA66F0">
had been only tender of his maid's character, but had not at all recommended her. Why, Madam, &s;ays he, my wife was cheated in this wench, only by the people &s;he lived with before giving her ambiguous an&s;wers, and &s;peaking as favourably of her as they could; and that is the ruin of us all, adds he, in taking &s;ervants.</P>
<P>But Sir, &s;ays I, the lady &s;he lived with before, did your lady a great deal of wrong, if &s;he knew her to be what you &s;ay &s;he was in her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I don't know, Madam, how it was for that: I never meddle with the&s;e things, &s;ays he, but I believe my wife was not &s;o nice in her inquiries as you are; or, if &s;he was, &s;he was ea&s;ier to be cheated in their an&s;wers; and 'tis the ladies being thus backward to give ju&s;t and plain accounts to one another, that is the rea&s;on that &s;uch a wretched gang of wenches run from hou&s;e to hou&s;e and get places, and behave in them as they do. Would the ladies, &s;ays he, be ju&s;t to one another, &s;peak plainly and hone&s;tly, and give the creatures &s;uch characters as they de&s;erve, they would take care to de&s;erve better characters, and not behave &s;o in&s;olently, and &s;o &s;aucily as they do. This jade, Madam, &s;ays he, that you come to inquire of, has in&s;ulted and taunted her mi&s;tre&s;s two or three times, at &s;uch a rate, that I have been forced to &s;end a footman into the room to bring her out by the head and &s;houlders, for fear her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould be frighted: and yet &s;he is &s;o good to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lut, that &s;he cannot find in her heart to &s;peak the truth of her.</P>
<P>My dear, &s;ays the lady, I have not &s;aid any thing but truth of her.</P>
<P>Well, my dear, &s;ays &s;he again, I was not upon my oath.</P>
<P>Why, that is true too, child, &s;aid he, but you are upon your honour, and that is equivalent to an oath; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would be hard to have this lady left to take &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into her hou&s;e, merely for fear of injuring the wench; why, you would injure the family you &s;uffer to take her, much more than the maid.

<P>I have al&s;o known a mi&s;tre&s;s injure a &s;ervant by her partially in favour of other &s;ervants, and give a maid an ill character when &s;he has not de&s;erved it, by the mere reproaches rai&s;ed on her by others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible to reckon up all the ca&s;es in which a mi&s;tre&s;s may injure a &s;ervant 'tis true, and there can no rule be &s;et &s;o exact, as that nobody &s;hall be oppre&s;&s;ed. But I have two things to &s;ay:</P>
<P N="1">1. All the inju&s;tice that can be &s;uppo&s;ed to happen that way, is not equal to that which mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and families now &s;uffer from the in&s;olence and ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;ervants;
<PB N="279" REF="025384_0278_0FCD11EBAE784D20">
and therefore the remedy is to be embraced, and the le&s;&s;er evil cho&s;en.</P>
<P N="2">2. There may be methods directed by the law, that in &s;uch ca&s;es, where mi&s;tre&s;&s;es have nothing capital to charge upon a &s;ervant, they &s;hall be obliged to give them certifi|cates of their behaviour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often thought of that; but unle&s;s the form of that certificate be &s;ettled and adju&s;ted by that very act of parliament, the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es will ju&s;t write what they plea&s;e, and when they are produced again&s;t a &s;er|vant, will &s;ay nothing in their certificates that &s;hall do them any &s;ervice, or recommend them at all to any one el&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e mu&s;t be very malicious people that will go that length with a &s;ervant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;uch people there are, and &s;uch per|haps always will be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there may be a remedy for that too, for there may be two or three &s;everal forms of certi|ficates directed by the law; one volunteer, and full to all the behaviour of a &s;ervant, and the other to her hone&s;ty and &s;obriety only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, child, nobody would take a &s;ervant that had only your &s;econd-rate certificate; they would pre&s;ently &s;ay, her mi&s;tre&s;s had given no character but what &s;he could not help.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rather think, Madam, that all &s;ervants would content them&s;elves with what you are plea&s;ed to call my &s;econd rate certificate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, let us hear what kind of certificate it is, if you are lawyer enough to draw it up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not lawyer enough to draw it up in form; but it &s;hould be to this purpo&s;e, Madam.</P>

<P>Why truly, niece, a &s;ervant that could not de|&s;erve &s;o much character as that, no body ought to take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, and a &s;ervant that did de|&s;erve &s;o much character as that, no mi&s;tre&s;s ought to deny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e, &s;i&s;ter, a mi&s;tre&s;s would ma|liciou&s;ly deny it, as I &s;aid before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then the maid &s;hould have the &s;ame remedy as &s;he has for her wages, viz. complain to a ju&s;|tice of peace, that in ca&s;e upon the mi&s;tre&s;s's being heard, if &s;he could not give &s;ufficient rea&s;ons and proof of the fact, for which &s;he refu&s;ed &s;uch a certificate, the ju&s;|tice &s;hould &s;ign the certificate to the maid, intimating that having heard all that could be alledged, he did not find there was &s;ufficient cau&s;e for refu&s;ing it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, niece, and what was your fir&s;t rate cer|tificate pray, that you call this the &s;econd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam, when a mi&s;tre&s;s may have a kindne&s;s for a &s;ervant, and is willing to give her an ex|traordinary recommendation, &s;he may add, &s;he is a very good needle-woman, or that &s;he is a very good cook, that &s;he was not only faithful, but diligent, and &s;o in other ca|&s;es: But, as I &s;aid, I believe any &s;ervant will be content|ed with the &s;econd, which is &s;ufficient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree, that the giving &s;uch certificates, would put and end to the&s;e inquiries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which oftentimes leaves us in the dark as much as we were before they are made; nay, and &s;ometimes more a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is our fault indeed, that we will not with freedom and plainne&s;s acquaint one another, what we are to expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">om the maids we hire; and 'tis pre&s;uming up|on this charitable di&s;po&s;ition of mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, that maids be|have &s;o &s;aucily as they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if any of my maids go from me, I tell them plainly before-hand what they are to expect of me, and what kind of character I &s;hall give them, if they &s;end any body to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fir&s;t Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what effect has it upon them? Are they the better for it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'll tell you what effect it had upon one of my maids. I had told her my mind very roundly
<PB N="281" REF="025384_0280_0FCD11F0438AE7F8">
one day, upon occa&s;ion of &s;omethi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g I did not like, and truly my maid turned very &s;hort upon me, and told me &s;he was &s;orry &s;he could not plea&s;e me, and hoped I would provide my&s;elf then. I told her, that &s;he &s;hould not &s;ay, &s;he could not plea&s;e me, but that &s;he would not plea&s;e me.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered very pertly, that it was as I would, I might take it which way I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Very well, &s;ays I, Mary, you are very tart with me, I hope when you &s;end your next mi&s;tre&s;s to me for a cha|racter, you will expect to hear the&s;e very words again.</P>
<P>Why, would I be &s;o barbarous, &s;aid &s;he, to rip up words that pa&s;&s;ed in anger, and give them for the character of any &s;ervant.</P>
<P>No, Mary, &s;ays I, you &s;hould not &s;ay, will I be &s;o bar|barous; you &s;hould &s;ay, would I be &s;o hone&s;t as to give a character of you from your own mouth. Depend upon it, Mary &s;ays I, I &s;hould not be &s;o unju&s;t to any mi&s;tre&s;s to conceal a thing of that moment from them; why, it would be doing them the greate&s;t injury in the world.</P>
<P>She &s;tood &s;till a good while, and &s;aid nothing; but as &s;he &s;aw me looking at her, as if I expected an an&s;wer, the girl fell a crying, run to me, and offering to kneel to me, begged my pardon, and told me, &s;he hoped I would allow her to recal her warning, for &s;he was re&s;olved &s;he would live with me till &s;he de&s;erved a better character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor girl! I &s;hould have told her &s;he might go when &s;he would then, for &s;he had de&s;erved a better character ju&s;t then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not &s;ay &s;o to her, but I would not let her kneel; and I told her I would not in&s;i&s;t upon her warning; for as long as &s;he behaved &s;o to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I believed I &s;hould never put her away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but did &s;he mend afterwards&punc;.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed &s;he was a very good &s;ervant be|fore, only a little ha&s;ty, and impatient of reproof; but &s;he proved the be&s;t &s;ervant after it, that any body ever had. She is with me &s;till.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is certainly &s;o, if we give fair, bold, and ju&s;t characters of them, and if it once came to be the cu&s;tom or general u&s;age among mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;ervants would quickly carry it after another manner; at lea&s;t they would take
<PB N="282" REF="025384_0281_0FCD11F1EDBE53C0">
care to part upon as good terms as they could with their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>And we &s;hould not cheat one another as we do now, in giving characters to the vile&s;t creatures that fall in our way.</P>
