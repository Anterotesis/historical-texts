<Q>A Day of Darkne&s;s.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>_ZEPHANIAH</HI> was &s;ent to GOD'S people in the days of <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> king of <HI>Judah,</HI> who&s;e reign was va&s;tly different from that of his father <HI>Amon.</HI> Of <HI>Amon</HI> we read,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings 21 20</NOTE> <HI>That he did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, &s;erved idols, and for&s;ook the God of his fathers</HI>: But when <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> his &s;on came to the Throne, in|&s;tead of treading in his father's &s;teps, he &s;oon &s;et about a work of reformation among the peo|ple, and was greatly &s;ucceeded in his endeavours for that end.&mdash; But yet after a while, the time
<PB N="6" REF="007383_0005_102B8CF342D1F838">
came, when this great and good work abated, and the people &s;hamefully return'd to their old &s;ins again&mdash; Upon this, God &s;ent his &s;ervant the prophet to them, to reprove them for their &s;ins, warn them of the judgments that were coming on them, and to per&s;uade them to repent of their evil deeds, that &s;o God might turn from the fiercene&s;s of his anger, and repent of the evil, he had tho't to do unto them.</P>
<P>THE particular judgment they were threat|ned with was the coming of their BABYLONISH enemies, who &s;hould make great havock, and &s;laughter among them; which is here call'd the <HI>day of the Lord's &s;acrifice</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">context. ver&s;e 8.</NOTE>. becau&s;e much blood would then be &s;hed, and the &s;lain of the Lord be multiplied&mdash;and left they &s;hould put this evil day far away, the prophet a&s;&s;ured them, that <HI>it was near,</HI> and <HI>ha&s;ted greatly.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">ver&s;e 14.</NOTE> And that he might thro'ly awaken them, he &s;peaks of this day of their calamity, which was ha&s;tening on them, in all the expre&s;&s;ions of dread and terror that can be. He therefore calls it, <HI>the Day of the Lord,</HI> the great day of the Lord, a day of wrath, of trouble, and di&s;tre&s;s; a day of wa&s;tene&s;s, and de&s;olation; and in the words I have cho&s;en for my text&mdash; <HI>a day of darkne&s;s,</HI> i. e. a day of great calamity, and di&s;tre&s;s, a day when every thing round them &s;hould look with a dark and melancholly a&s;pect on them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007383_0006_102B8CF569499098">Now, as this was the ca&s;e of God's people then, &s;o it al&s;o &s;ometimes is, of a people at this day; and I can't but think, that they who&s;e <HI>hearts are wi&s;e to di&s;cern time and judgment,</HI> look upon this to be very much our own ca&s;e, and think the pre&s;ent day, a day of darkne&s;s with us. And if &s;o, then I hope, it will not be tho't, altoge|ther foreign to the bu&s;ine&s;s of this day; if, in|&s;tead of di&s;cour&s;ing of the divine original of civil government, and how great a ble&s;&s;ing it is to mankind; of the qualifications of civil rulers, and their duty to the people under their go|vernment; and al&s;o, the duty of a people to tho&s;e in civil authority over them; (which are &s;ubjects that have been &s;o often handled, on this anniver&s;ary &s;olemnity) I &s;hould come to you with a few meditations, on the words I have pitched upon for my text&mdash;<HI>a day of darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>HERE in di&s;cour&s;ing from them, I &s;hall en|deavour, by divine help, to con&s;ider, and &s;hew the&s;e two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN it may be &s;aid to be a day of dark|ne&s;s with a people; or when their ca&s;e may be dark and melancholly.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHAT is the duty of a people at &s;uch a day.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN it may be &s;aid to be a day of dark|ne&s;s with a people; or when their ca&s;e may be
<PB N="8" REF="007383_0007_102B8CF703322168">
dark and melancholly. And here it may be &s;aid,&mdash;it is &s;uch a day with them,</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN it is a day of great apo&s;tacy and de|clen&s;ion, and many heaven-provoking &s;ins are to be &s;een in the mid&s;t of them.&mdash;So contrary both to the law and nature of God is &s;in, that he can't but be provok'd with it, and it is pe|culiarly offen&s;ive to him in his own covenant|people; nor will he let it go unpuni&s;h'd in them. <HI>You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore will I puni&s;h you, for all your iniquities.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amos 3.2.</NOTE> <HI>Shall I not vi&s;it for the&s;e things &s;aith the Lord? &s;hall not my &s;oul be avenged on &s;uch a nation as this?</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. 5.29.</NOTE></P>
<P>ISRAEL were a peculiar people to him, and a people for whom he had done more, than for any other nation under heaven; but they be|came very &s;inful and apo&s;tate: and therefore he bro't that charge again&s;t them,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 1, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> <HI>I have nouri&s;h'd, and brought up children, but they have rebelled a|gain&s;t me; the ox knoweth his owner, and the a&s;s his ma&s;ters crib, but my people doth not know, I&s;rael doth not con&s;ider</HI>; and the lamentation made over them; <HI>Ah &s;inful nation, a people laden with iniquity, &amp;c.</HI> And the heaven and earth were called to witne&s;s again&s;t them, and to &s;tand amaz'd at their ingratitude and rebellion, &mdash; <HI>Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O ye heavens at this, and be horribly afraid; be

ye very de&s;olate, &s;aith the Lord; for my people have committed two evils, they have for&s;aken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ci&s;terns, broken ci&s;terns that can hold no water.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. 2.12; I3.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND as that was the ca&s;e of God's antient people, &s;o it may be the ca&s;e of a people at this day; and when it is &s;o, they are in a very &s;ad and melancholly one; for what can have a dar|ker, a&s;pect on them, than the abounding of drunkene&s;s, prophanene&s;s, uncleanne&s;s, cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, inju&s;tice, extortion, oppre&s;&s;ion, &amp;c? verily, when this is their ca&s;e, they may well tremble for fear of God, and be afraid of his judgments&mdash;The&s;e and &s;uch like &s;ins, may turn the &s;miles of providence into frowns, and pull down the judgments of heaven on them, and herefor, God may be provoked to make them de&s;olate, a land not inhabited.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. SUCH a day it is al&s;o with a people, when religion, pure and undefiled religion, which was once their glory, is apace langui&s;hing and dying; among them&mdash;Religion is an honour both to particular per&s;ons, and al&s;o to a people; it is &s;o to per&s;ons of all orders and ages, high and low, rich and poor, old and young, yea, to kings and princes, rulers, and judges of the earth.&mdash;The
<PB N="10" REF="007383_0009_102B8CFB8A71F728">
emperor <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> therefore once &s;aid, <HI>he accoun|ted is a greater honour and joy to him, that he was a member of a church, than emperor of the world.</HI> The flouri&s;hing of religion, will exalt a people, but the decay of it, be a reproach to them&mdash;If it be a&s;k'd&mdash;when is religion evidently decaying among a people? I an&s;wer, it is &s;o, when the profe&s;&s;ors of it have lo&s;t that zeal (I don't mean a blind enthu&s;ia&s;tick zeal, but a true chri&s;tian zeal, and a zeal according to knowledge) which once they had; and are become indifferent in religion&mdash;when, like the church of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> they are lukewarm, and neither cold, nor hot&mdash;and when like the church of <HI>Ephe&s;u&s;, they have lo&s;t their fir&s;t love</HI>&mdash;when the day of the Lord, which once was &s;anctified, is &s;hamefully broken, and due care not to put a &s;top thereto, by tho&s;e who&s;e proper bu&s;ine&s;s it is to do it&mdash;when the wor&s;hip, and ordinances of God's hou&s;e are neg|lected, and the duties of religion become tire&s;ome to them&mdash;when the faithful me&s;&s;engers of God, and his me&s;&s;ages by them are &s;lighted, &s;o that they have rea&s;on to complaim, <HI>who hath believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? Verily, I have laboured in vain, &amp;c.</HI>&mdash;when the &s;upport of the go&s;pel, and the faithful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, is looked upon as a burthen too heavy for them to bear, and what they do towards it not chearfully, but grudgingly&mdash; when family religion, government, and in|&s;truction are greatly wanting, and they who
<PB N="11" REF="007383_0010_102B8CFDC99B9070">
&s;hould &s;upport them, become lovers of plea&s;ure, and of the world, more than of God, and re|ligion: when this, I &s;ay, is the ca&s;e of a people, religion is plainly upon the decline, and it is a dark day with them, for what can they expect, unle&s;s they remember from whence they are fal|len, and repent, and do their fir&s;t works, but that God come unto them quickly, and remove their candle&s;tick out of it's place, take away his gospel from them, turn their teachers into cor|ners, and &s;end that dreadful famine among them, not a famine of bread, nor a thir&s;t for water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord&mdash; Again,</P>
<P N="3">3dly. SUCH a day is it with a people, when for their &s;ins, God threatens, or vi&s;its them with tho&s;e &s;ore judgments, the famine, pe&s;ti|lence and &s;word.&mdash;It is &s;o, when God calls for a dearth, by rea&s;on of which, they are threaten|ed with &s;carcity of bread. Rain from heaven, and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, are great &s;miles of provi|dence; and when God gives both the former, and the latter rain in their &s;ea&s;on, ble&s;&s;ing the &s;pringing of the year, and al&s;o crowning it with his great goodne&s;s; &s;o that there is gra&s;s for the cattle, and herb for the &s;ervice of man, a tribute of prai&s;e is due to him therefor&mdash;Now that God who is the father of the rain, and who begetteth the drops of the dew, who &s;ometimes visits the earth, and waters it with the river of God,
<PB N="12" REF="007383_0011_102B8CFF542C94D0">
which is full of water, can, when he plea&s;eth, &s;top the bottles of heaven, upon which, in&s;tead of cooling and refre&s;hing &s;howers, con&s;tant &s;corching heats, and &s;carcity follow.&mdash;This judgment God threatned his people with; <HI>I will con&s;ume them by famine.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 14.12.</NOTE> This judgment he al&s;o brought upon them, telling them at the &s;ame time, why he &s;ent it, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e they built their own hou&s;es in a co&s;tly manner, and let his hou&s;e lie wa&s;te. <HI>Ye looked for much, and to it came to little, and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it: why? &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts: Be|cau&s;e of mine hou&s;e that is wa&s;te, and ye run every man unto his own hou&s;e. Therefore the heaven over you is &s;tayed from dew, and the earth is &s;tayed from her fruit. And I called for a drought upon the Land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oyl,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hag. 1. 9, 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND when this is the ca&s;e of a people, what a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time is it!&mdash;<HI>when the heaven over their head is bra&s;s, and the earth under them is iron, and the rain of their land powder and dust&mdash;when the vine is dried up, the apple tree, and all the trees of the field are withered. When the land mourneth,</HI> becau&s;e the harve&s;t of the field is peri&s;hed&mdash;when the bea&s;ts groan, and the herds of cattle are per|plexed, becau&s;e they have no pa&s;ture, and the flocks of &s;heep are made de&s;olate&mdash;when the fire devoureth the pa&s;tures of the wilderne&s;s, and
<PB N="13" REF="007383_0012_102B8D00E2061158">
the flame burneth up the trees of the wood, and the bea&s;ts of the field cry, becau&s;e the rivers of waters are dried up.&mdash;See the di&s;tre&s;s of &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on &s;poken of by the prophet,&mdash;<HI>Judah mour|neth, and the gates thereof langui&s;h, they are black to the ground, and the cry of Jeru&s;alem is gone up: becau&s;e the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plow-men were a&s;hamed, they co|vered their heads.

<P>AGAIN, &s;uch a day it is al&s;o, when God &s;ends contagious and mortal &s;ickne&s;s among them. This is another of tho&s;e judgments God threatned his people with, in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience. <HI>The Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy &s;eed, even great plagues, and of long continuance; and &s;ore &s;ickne&s;s, and of long continu|ance.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. 28.59.</NOTE> And by this judgment did he again and again di&s;tre&s;s and wa&s;te them.

<P>WHAT a dark day, when God &s;ends among a people the pe&s;tilence that walketh in darkne&s;s, and the de&s;truction that wa&s;teth at noon-day:
<PB N="14" REF="007383_0013_102B8D030E1502D0">
when they are afraid, for the terror by night, and the arrow that flieth by day: when &s;ickne&s;s enters the city, and the de&s;troying angel &s;tands with his &s;word drawn over it: when the di&s;|temper &s;oon &s;preads, and death rides in triumph in the &s;treets, &s;paring neither rich nor poor, old nor young, and many, in a &s;hort time, are car|ried to the grave, that hou&s;e appointed for all living; and that cry is heard, <HI>death is come up into our windows, to cut off our young men from without, and our children from the &s;treets.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 9, 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>AGAIN, &s;uch a day al&s;o it is when the people are call'd to hear the &s;ound of the trumpet and the alarm of war.</P>
<P>PEACE on honorable terms, when every one can &s;it quietly under his own vine and fig-tree, and there be none to make them afraid, is a great favour of heaven; and the time will come, when the bow &s;hall be broken, the chariot burnt in the fire, and wars cea&s;e from one end of the earth to the other. The time, when they &s;hall beat their &s;words into plow-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks: nation &s;hall not lift up the &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more; and then in&s;tead of wars and fightings which proceed from the lu&s;ts of men, the wolf &s;hall dwell with the lamb, and the leo|pard lie down with the kid, the calf, the young

<P>THERE are tho&s;e, I am &s;en&s;ible, who doubt the lawfulne&s;s of chri&s;tians making war on any occa&s;ion; but to me it &s;eems plain there can be no ju&s;t ground therefor either from rea&s;on or re|velation: for when the &s;oldiers came to <HI>John</HI> the bapti&s;t, the fore-runner of Chri&s;t, with that en|quiry, <HI>what &s;hall we do?</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke 3.14</NOTE> he didn't order them to lay down their arms, telling them there would be no need of men of a military character, and martial &s;pirit under the go&s;pel; but taught them how to behave in the &s;tation they were in: <HI>do violence to no man, neither accu&s;e any fal&s;ly, and be content with your wages.</HI></P>
<P>NOT that chri&s;tians &s;hould delight in war, &s;hedding blood, preying upon, and de&s;troying one another; no, by no means, for this don't become rea&s;onable creatures, much le&s;s chri&s;tians&mdash;but yet, a martial &s;pirit is a noble &s;pirit, and &s;oldiers, expert in war, of good conduct,
<PB N="16" REF="007383_0015_102B8D066C1D55C0">
and undaunted courage, are an honor to their country, and the &s;afety of a people, under God, depends not a little on them; and to take up arms both offen&s;ively and defen&s;ively, is &s;ome|times ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The in&s;ults, inroads and encroachments of their ambitious and perfidious enemies upon them, the pre&s;ervation of their religion, rights, and properties, yea, their lives, and the lives of theirs, call aloud hereto; and then their &s;tate is melancholly.&mdash;Thus it is, when great preparations for war are making both by &s;ea and land, fleets man'd and ready for action, land-forces al&s;o rais'd, well-arm'd, well|di&s;ciplined, and prepared to march.</P>
<P>THUS it is al&s;o, when war is publickly pro|claimed, and that cry heard; prepare war, wake up the, mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up&mdash; beat your plow-&s;hares into &s;words, and your pruning hooks into &s;pears, let the weak &s;ay, I am &s;trong; order the buckler and &s;hield, and draw near to battle; harne&s;s the hor&s;es, mount ye hor&s;emen, and &s;tand forth with your helmets, furni&s;h the &s;pears, put on the brigandines.&mdash;The &s;word!

<P>No man was born for him&s;elf; nor &s;hould any one &s;eek his own, but every one another's wealth. A publick-&s;pirit is a noble and truly chri&s;tian &s;pirit, but a narrow and contracted one is mean and &s;ordid; and they who are of &s;uch a &s;pirit, are often very far from being the per&s;ons they feign them&s;elves to be; they may &s;peak fair, pretend a generous love to mankind, and concern for the common welfare of the places where they live; but SELF is at the bottom, and they will not be likely to lay out them&s;elves to &s;erve the publick, unle&s;s they can &s;erve them|&s;elves at the &s;ame time. &mdash; This &s;pirit, in&s;tead of inclining them to feed the hungry, and cloath the naked, will rather di&s;po&s;e them to vex, grieve and grind the face of the poor; and do &s;uch mean and ungenerous actions, as they ought to abhor and be a&s;hamed of; and what
<PB N="19" REF="007383_0018_102B8D0CD2F2B928">
may not per&s;ons of this &s;pirit be often bribed to do?</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, per&s;ons of a gene|rous and publick &s;pirit, will be u&s;eful and &s;er|viceable both in church and &s;tate, and ble&s;&s;ings to the places where they live.&mdash;They will de&s;ire, and endeavour to do good to all, as they have opportunity, and contrive how others may be the better for them&mdash;like the liberal man, they will devi&s;e liberal things, and by liberal things &s;hall they &s;tand.&mdash;</P>
<P>ARE they in civil authority, they will endea|vour to be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God; and by no means will they be per&s;waded to betray their tru&s;t. They will &s;incerely endeavour to know the duty of the &s;tation they are in, and as &s;incerely endeavour faithfully to perform it.</P>
