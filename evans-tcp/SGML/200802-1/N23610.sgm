<HEAD>A SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>_TO the honour of God, and for the benefit of his people, more e&s;pecially in this part of the town, this hou&s;e, in which we are now met for the fir&s;t time, has lately been erected and completed, for the exerci&s;e of public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Let us, with becoming &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, give our atten|tion to what may be delivered at this time, agreeably to tho&s;e words of the P&s;almi&s;t, contained in
<Q><BIBL><HI>THE 5</HI>th <HI>PSALM, 7</HI>th <HI>VERSE.</HI></BIBL>
<P>"But as for me, I will come into thy hou&s;e, in the mul|titude of thy mercy; and in thy fear will I wor&s;hip toward thy holy temple."</P></Q></P>
<P>In the beginning of this P&s;alm we find the P&s;almi&s;t fervently begging audience of God to his prayer, and urging this from God's relation to him, and his own re&s;olved choice of him alone as the object of his wor|&s;hip; as in the following elegant expre&s;&s;ions, in the 1&s;t and 2d ver&s;es. "Give ear to my words, O Lord; con&s;ider my meditation. Hearken unto the voice of
<PB N="6" REF="031240_0004_0FEAF91898D76000">
my cry, my King and my God; for unto thee will I pray." He in the next place expre&s;&s;es his hopeful de|&s;ire that God will &s;peedily hear him when calling up|on him by prayer, and grant an an&s;wer of peace there|to. Says he, "My voice &s;halt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up." With a confi|dent and patient expectation he will wait for relief, under his perplexing troubles: and he encourages him&s;elf thereunto, it may be, in part, from the charac|ters of his adver&s;aries, again&s;t whom he prays; who, through their wickedne&s;s, are &s;o contrary to God, that he cannot choo&s;e but hear his faithful &s;ervant's prayers, and will de&s;troy the workers of iniquity. "For thou art not a God that hath plea&s;ure in wick|edne&s;s, neither &s;hall evil dwell with thee. The fooli&s;h &s;hall not &s;tand in thy &s;ight: thou hate&s;t all workers of iniquity. Thou &s;halt de&s;troy them that &s;peak lea&s;ing; the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man."</P>
<P>The text contains his pious re&s;olution what he would make his con&s;tant practice. He would come into the hou&s;e of God, and, in his fear, wor&s;hip to|ward his holy temple. He would, with holy boldne&s;s and confidence, appear in the pre&s;ence of God. "I will come into thy hou&s;e,"&mdash;meaning the tabernacle, from which, probably, he might at this time be ex|cluded by the rage and malice of his adver&s;aries. Yet he had a confident expectation, that, through the good|ne&s;s and mercy of God, the ob&s;tacles of hindrance would &s;hortly be removed, and the way opened for his wor&s;hipping him according to his appointment, as he heretofore had done in his hou&s;e, or tabernacle. And
<PB N="7" REF="031240_0005_0FEAF91BB8EEAD30">
when thus permitted, he would do it in the fear of God. "In thy fear, &s;aith he, will I wor&s;hip toward thy holy temple;" that is, the tabernacle, which in Scripture is &s;ometimes called by that name; for the temple was not at this time built. Though deprived of the agreeable and delightful &s;atisfaction of wor&s;hip|ping in the tabernacle, yet he &s;hould ever bear it upon his mind; nay, it could not be ea&s;ily eradicated there|from. Though his troubles were many and di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing, yet they would not do this. In the fear of God, he would wor&s;hip towards the temple of his holine&s;s. He was a &s;teady &s;eeker of God. He maintained a con|&s;tant cour&s;e of &s;ecret wor&s;hip, as well as made con|&s;cience of attending the public in&s;titutions of religion. He frequently prayed by him&s;elf alone; and in this way he poured out his &s;oul before the Lord, and re|&s;olved upon the continued practice of this important duty; as evidently appears by what he &s;ays in the context: "My voice &s;halt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up." He made it his bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as his delight, to improve all opportunities of waiting on God in his more public in&s;tituted wor&s;hip: yea, it was to his great comfort and &s;atisfaction, when he was permitted to wor&s;hip God in his &s;anctuary, in concert with his people. He was rejoiced at &s;uch &s;ea|&s;ons; and it was to his great grief when deprived thereof; as appears in divers pa&s;&s;ages in the P&s;alms, particularly 122d and 42d. "I was glad when they &s;aid unto me, Let us go into the hou&s;e of the Lord." "As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, &s;o pant|eth my &s;oul after thee, O God. My &s;oul thir&s;teth
<PB N="8" REF="031240_0006_0FEB80561A1523A8">
for God, for the living God: when &s;hall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat, day and night, while they continually &s;ay unto me, Where is thy God? When I remember the&s;e things, I pour out my &s;oul in me: for I had gone with the multitude; I went with them to the hou&s;e of God; with the voice of joy and prai&s;e, with a multitude that kept holy day." And we have, in the text, his determined re&s;olution to wor&s;hip God in &s;uch ways as Providence might permit, let others do as they would, either by contemning or neglecting the wor&s;hip of the only living and, true God. And this he would do in the fear of God.</P>
<P>Hence we may be led, from the pious re&s;olution of the P&s;almi&s;t, to con&s;ider, That it is the duty of the people of God, let others do what they will, re&s;olved|ly to come into his hou&s;e, in the multitude of his mercy, and in the fear of God, wor&s;hip in his holy temple.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI>&mdash;It is the duty of the people of God, re&s;olved|ly, in the multitude of his mercy, to come into his hou&s;e and wor&s;hip him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>&mdash;When they thus do, it is to be done in the fear of God.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI>&mdash;It is the duty of the people of God, re&s;olved|ly, in the multitude, or by the greatne&s;s of his mercy, to come into his hou&s;e and wor&s;hip him. It is the du|ty of the people of God, in &s;pecial, to wor&s;hip him. Upon this they are to re&s;olve. Indeed it is the duty of all, indi&s;criminately to wor&s;hip him, according to
<PB N="9" REF="031240_0007_0FEB8057A26CAAF8">
their ability, and the knowledge they have of God and their duty. This is what God requires of them. Hence the p&s;almi&s;t, in the 67th p&s;alm, &s;ays, "Let the people prai&s;e thee, O God. Let all the people prai&s;e thee." All are under obligation to wor&s;hip God. For this end they were made. They were made for the glory and &s;ervice of God. Were not made for them&s;elves; to live to, and &s;erve them&s;elves; but were made to &s;erve God, to wor&s;hip and glorify him, according to the directions given in his word; to live lives devoted to his fear and to his glory. Though it is far otherwi&s;e with multitudes of the human race. They bow down to &s;tocks and &s;tones, pay adoration to them which are no Gods, and acknowledge the re|ceipt of mercies to tho&s;e who have no power to be|&s;tow them. What va&s;t multitudes are there in a &s;tate of heatheni&s;h darkne&s;s, idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition, and who are peri&s;hing for lack of vi&s;ion! It is obvious that there are none but what are under obligation to wor&s;hip God; &s;ince he is their Creator from whom they receive their being, and it is he who pre&s;erves and upholds them in life and being. Hence Job &s;ays, "Thou ha&s;t granted me life and favour, and thy vi&s;i|tation hath pre&s;erved my &s;pirit." His hands have made and fa&s;hioned the&s;e bodies of ours, and they are fearfully and wonderfully made. He breathed into us the breath of life; made us living &s;ouls; endowed us with rational powers and faculties; teacheth us more than the bea&s;ts of the earth, and maketh us wi&s;er than the fowls of heaven."</P>
<P>Again; He is not only our Creator, but our kind and bountiful Benefactor. All that we have, we pri|marily receive from him. That which is nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="10" REF="031240_0008_0FEB805AF385E548">
pre&s;erve life, and all the ble&s;&s;ings, comforts and enjoy|ments of life, that we are made the happy partakers of, come from him, the great Author of all things. All, good and bad, &s;aints and &s;inners, are dependent on him for the common bounties of his providence, and are all &s;harers in them. He maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good, and &s;endeth rain on the ju&s;t and on the unju&s;t. So, all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings which any are made to enjoy, flow down to them from the Father of Lights and of Mercies. Hence the apo&s;|tle James &s;ays, "Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variablene&s;s, neither &s;had|ow of turning." Now, &s;urely, He who hath made us, and continues us in life, and furni&s;hes us with the ble&s;&s;|ings and comforts of life, has a &s;pecial right, yea, has the &s;ole right to us and our &s;ervices. All religious wor|&s;hip, homage, adoration and prai&s;e is to be a&s;cribed to Him alone, as his due; and this through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of God. And he is highly di&s;plea&s;ed if it be given to another. Says he,&mdash;I&s;aiah xlii.8. "I am the Lord, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my prai&s;e to graven im|ages." The&s;e things con&s;idered, it plainly appears that all are under obligation to wor&s;hip God; to pay all religious wor&s;hip and &s;ervice to him. And what he requires of them in this, as well as every thing el&s;e, is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable; for he requires nothing of any of his intelligent creatures but what is ju&s;t. To do otherwi&s;e would be incon&s;i&s;tent with his holine&s;s and the purity of his nature; with that ju&s;tice and equity which runs through the whole of the admini&s;tration of the divine government.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="031240_0009_0FEB805C854FB9D8">It is the duty of all, indi&s;criminately, to wor&s;hip God, who is the &s;upreme Ruler and Governor of the univer&s;e. Much more &s;o, then, is it the duty of &s;uch as live in a land of Go&s;pel light and knowledge, that are favoured with the word and ordinances of the Lord, and have the knowledge of his mind and will plainly revealed in the word of truth. The law, word and ordinances of God are the di&s;tingui&s;hing privilege of tho&s;e who live in a land of Go&s;pel light. "He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" But, more e&s;pe|cially, God's cho&s;en, covenant people are under pecu|liar obligations, yea, the &s;tronge&s;t ties, to wor&s;hip him. For they are his, not only by right of creation, but by purcha&s;e, by right of redemption. All that do or &s;hall believe in Chri&s;t, to the world's end, are the purcha&s;e of his blood. With this he has bought them: And this is the argument which the apo&s;tle u&s;eth with the believ|ing Corinthians, to glorify God with their bodies and their &s;pirits which are his. As in 1 Cor. vi.19, 20. "What, know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Gho&s;t, which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own! For ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your &s;pirit, which are God's." What this price is, the apo&s;tle Peter tells us, both negatively and po&s;i|tively. "Fora&s;much as ye know that ye were re|deemed, not with corruptible things, as &s;ilver and gold, from your vain conver&s;ation, received by tradi|tion, from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Chri&s;t, as of a lamb without blemi&s;h, and without &s;pot." Surely then, &s;uch as are thus redeemed, are
<PB N="12" REF="031240_0010_0FEB806306004528">
under peculiar obligations to devote their time, talents and lives to the &s;ervice of God. Yea, their all is to be devoted to him. They &s;hould have an eye to his glory in all they do. Hence that exhortation, 1 Cor. x.31. "Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God." They &s;hould give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name, according to the exhortation, p&s;alm xxix.2. "And wor&s;hip the Lord in the beauty of holine&s;s."</P>
<P>It may here be ob&s;erved that re&s;olution is nece&s;&s;ary to the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God: and this is e&s;&s;en|tial in that which is private, &s;ocial, and public. Re&s;|olution will overcome many, and &s;ometimes great ob&s;tacles. This we &s;ee it will often do in the common affairs and concerns of life, e&s;pecially where &s;elf-inter|e&s;t lies at &s;take: Should it not much more be exer|ci&s;ed by us, in things of a higher nature, that concern our be&s;t intere&s;t, even our &s;ouls' &s;alvation, as the wor|&s;hip and kingdom of God mo&s;t certainly does?</P>
<P>The honour and glory of God mo&s;t nearly and highly concerns every one: For whatever they do for his glory and honour will finally redound to their own &s;aving advantage. Whatever they do for him will not go unnoticed or unrewarded by him. Even he that gives to a di&s;ciple, in the name of a di&s;ciple, a cup of cold water, we are a&s;&s;ured &s;hall not lo&s;e his reward. This is the declaration of our Lord and Ma&s;ter. Matt. x.40. and the two la&s;t ver&s;es. "He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that &s;ent me. He that receiveth a prophet, in the name of a prophet, &s;hall receive a prophet's re|ward: And he that receiveth a righteous man, in the
<PB N="13" REF="031240_0011_0FEB80648BE21570">
name of a righteous man, &s;hall receive a righteous man's reward. And who&s;oever &s;hall give to drink unto one of the&s;e little ones, a cup of cold water only, in the name of a di&s;ciple, verily, I &s;ay unto you, he &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e his reward." But then where love is wanting to God and his wor&s;hip, his &s;ervice will not be delightful, but tedious or irk&s;ome. It is therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary that we have true love to God; otherwi&s;e we &s;hall not have any real delight or &s;atisfaction in his wor&s;hip or &s;ervice. Love will excite to re&s;olution and diligence in the duties of Chri&s;tianity. Want of re&s;olution is undoubtedly one great rea&s;on why there is &s;uch neglect in the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God. Love to him, and re&s;olution in his &s;ervice will have a happy tendency to check &s;loth and negligence herein: Yea, it will &s;urmount many and great ob&s;tacles. Good rea&s;on then is there that the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God &s;hould be &s;eriou&s;ly re|&s;olved upon by his people. Thus we find Jo&s;hua re|&s;olving, not only for him&s;elf, but his hou&s;e and family, that they would &s;erve the Lord. It is a happy choice they make who &s;incerely choo&s;e the &s;ervice and wor|&s;hip of God. Like unto this is the p&s;almi&s;t's re&s;olu|tion in the text, that he would wor&s;hip God. Though others neglected temple wor&s;hip, yet he would im|prove all opportunities that pre&s;ented for his going into the hou&s;e of the Lord, and wor&s;hipping him in the way of his own appointment. "But as for me, I will come into thy hou&s;e, in the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy fear will I wor&s;hip toward thy holy temple."</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="031240_0012_0FEB8067B2783E08">It is the duty of the people of God to wor&s;hip him publickly; not only in &s;ecret and in their families, but in his hou&s;e; e&s;pecially upon his Sabbaths or holy days. Hence God &s;ays to the children of I&s;rael, "Ye &s;hall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my &s;anctuary: I am the Lord." It is the appointment of God that they &s;hould do &s;o; and it has been the practice of his people, in all ages of the world. It was David's re&s;o|lution to come into the hou&s;e of the Lord, and wor|&s;hip there, with others of his faithful wor&s;hippers. And this he would do in the multitude of God's mer|cy; or <HI>by thy great mercy,</HI> as &s;ome render it: that is, tru&s;ting only to thy great mercy for admittance thith|er, and acceptance there: or for, or becau&s;e of thy many mercies to me; for which I will come to pay my thanks and &s;ervice unto thee. Though frequently it was &s;o with him that he was not permitted to enjoy this ble&s;&s;ed privilege, of meeting with the people of God at his hou&s;e, and wor&s;hipping him there, yet his heart and mind was there; and it was always to his great grief, when deprived of temple wor&s;hip. And it always rejoiced his heart when he was favoured with an opportunity for &s;eeing the going of his God and King in his &s;anctuary. He could &s;ay, in the &s;incerity of his heart, as in P&s;alm xxvi.8. "Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy hou&s;e, and the place where thine honour dwelleth."</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>&mdash;It is the duty of the people of God to wor&s;hip him in fear. We are to attend upon divine in&s;titutions with that &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;olemnity that becomes us; are to do it in the manner that God re|quires: And this mu&s;t needs be with reverence and
<PB N="15" REF="031240_0013_0FEB806ADE486930">
with godly fear: with &s;uitable apprehen&s;ions of his divine excellence and perfection. We &s;hould with becoming &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s con&s;ider, into who&s;e pre&s;ence it is that we come, when we enter the hou&s;e of God, to wor&s;hip: For it is no le&s;s than into the pre&s;ence of the great heart-&s;earching and rein-trying God, before whom we mu&s;t all, in the great day, in the day of judgment, appear, and render up an account, each one for him&s;elf, of the deeds done in the body. If our minds are duly impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of this, we &s;hall be likely to be awed into a holy fear and reverence of God, when we come into his hou&s;e, and attend upon his public, in&s;tituted wor&s;hip. Is it the duty of all per&s;ons to wor&s;hip God, not only privately but pub|lickly? let none then allowedly and contentedly live in the neglect of the one or the other. What God requires of us, as duty, is highly rea&s;onable: And it will be to our own advantage, if we attend hereunto in the manner required. And this mu&s;t be done in &s;pirit and in truth, if we would hope to be accepted of God. Thus we read, John iv.24. "God is a Spirit, and they that wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and truth." And as to the public, in&s;tituted wor&s;hip of God, it becomes all, but e&s;pecially Chri&s;tians, to endeavour after-&s;uch a pious di&s;po&s;ition and &s;pirit as David had. They &s;hould, as he did, manife&s;t a &s;in|cere regard for the wor&s;hip of God in his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped, there are many that are really of his di&s;po&s;ition, who&s;e local &s;ituation and circum&s;tances are &s;uch as render it impracticable, with frequency, to attend upon the &s;tated public wor&s;hip of God, in his hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="031240_0014_0FEB806FAB9A2F88">This has been the ca&s;e with you, my hearers, in this part of the town, and your ance&s;tors before you. But the pro&s;pect is now brightening, as to you and yours. You, not long &s;ince, reque&s;ted of the Congregational Society in this town, of which you are members, that public wor&s;hip might be held, a proportion of the time, in this part of it. They looked upon your re|que&s;t rea&s;onable; and, as I doubt not, having in their minds the injunction of our Lord and Ma&s;ter, "What|&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them," have complied with it. Be it &s;po|ken to the prai&s;e of the Society, that this affair has been conducted with &s;uch brotherly love, and Chri&s;tian har|mony. Notwith&s;tanding what has taken place, we look upon our&s;elves to be all brethren, and of one and the &s;ame Society. Let not Pa&s;tor or People be want|ing in their endeavours &s;till to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. As to the erecting of this Edifice, you that have been more particularly en|gaged in it, have, with much a&s;&s;iduity and unanimity, gone through with it. But, alas! while in the mid&s;t of it, a gloom over&s;pread you and us of this town, in the &s;udden removal by death of a principal proprie|tor,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mr. ISAIAH BAKER, who died September 25th, Aet. 56.

We would drop a tear over it, for our&s;elves, and for the bereaved widow and orphan children.</P>
<P>You will now con&s;ider, my friends, that you have an additional price put into your hands. I mean e&s;pecially, that you will have the privilege, more fre|quently,
<PB N="17" REF="031240_0015_0FEB807133C8D218">
of wor&s;hipping God in his hou&s;e than hereto|fore: And many that could not do it at all, may be in circum&s;tances to do it now. I tru&s;t you will not be re|gardle&s;s of the privilege. And as to this hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, as well as the other, <HI>may it be &s;aid of this and that man, he was born there.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, let us all manife&s;t our &s;incere regard to the word, wor&s;hip, and ordinances of the Lord, by a &s;teady and con&s;cientious attendance on them:&mdash;and may we be &s;o happy at la&s;t, as to meet in the tem|ple that is above.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM xxvii.4.</HI></BIBL>
<P>One thing have I de&s;ired of the Lord, that will I &s;eek after; that I may dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_A SENSE of Deity and duty is deeply impre&s;&s;ed upon the minds of men. The &s;till voice of rea&s;on, and the more powerful &s;ugge&s;tions of con&s;cience, with one voice teach us the exi&s;tence of a God, who&s;e being and perfections de&s;ervedly merit the attention of his creatures. There is not a creature which moves, or a plant which grows, but declares the hand which made it to be divine. How much more the intelligent part of creation, who are admoni&s;hed by all, within and without, to wor&s;hip and venerate their great Creator? The erection of this magnificent Building, and our a&s;&s;embling therein to Dedicate it unto God, is a proof al&s;o that we acknowl|edge
<PB N="4" REF="031240_0018_0FEB807C611E5138">
a Being who&s;e &s;overeignty and dominion it well becomes us to reverence and adore. The&s;e truths were too &s;trongly imprinted upon the heart of the p&s;almi&s;t to be era&s;ed either by the burdens of royalty or the equipage of a &s;plendid court. He thought it well be|came him to regard the great Lord of nature, and on many occa&s;ions, as in the words of the text, expre&s;&s;es his affection for public wor&s;hip and de&s;ire to "dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple."</P>
<P>"One thing have I de&s;ired of the Lord, that will I &s;eek after; that I may dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple." It is obvious that the pa&s;&s;age before us is not (but in part) to be literally under&s;tood. He does not mean to make his abode in places dedicated to God and &s;acred for pub|lic wor&s;hip; but an habitual &s;en&s;e which he enter|tained of the great duty and importance of frequently a&s;&s;embling there;&mdash;at all &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons and convenient opportunities, not only to have his affections, but his pre&s;ence there. To "behold the beauty of the Lord" in order to inflame his devotion, and to "inquire in his temple" that &s;o he might learn to do his will. In this view, the words before us are applicable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Well does it become us devoutly to attend and imitate the example of the pious p&s;alm|i&s;t. It will readily be acknowledged that public wor|&s;hip has been abu&s;ed; that many, it is to be feared, frequent the hou&s;e of God from &s;ini&s;ter views; and appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s the form without the power of godli|ne&s;s. But this can be no apology for others to with|draw; for certain it is, the example of one &s;inner can
<PB N="5" REF="031240_0019_0FEB807DE6CCDC80">
never ju&s;tify another; and that where no form of re|ligion appears, the power is not to be expected. To prove therefore the utility and importance of public wor&s;hip is the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e: and &s;ince there is an immediate connexion between the means and the end, it mu&s;t be of con&s;equence to re|gard the former, in order to obtain the latter.</P>
<P>Hence in the fir&s;t place, let us con&s;ider it with re|&s;pect to God. If there be a God who created the world, and &s;till continues his agency and protection, nothing can be more rea&s;onable and natural than that tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;i&s;t on his bounty, and are governed by his providence, &s;hould &s;uitably expre&s;s their gratitude and prai&s;e to the Giver of all good. But be&s;ides the private ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, and which merit a grateful return, there are numerous favours which we receive in common with others, and which ju&s;tly claim the united thanks of all, and the mo&s;t public expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude to our common Lord. So con&s;onant is this to the common &s;entiments of mankind, that the mo&s;t uncivilized and barbarous of the human race have ever agreed in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome form of wor&s;hip, and erecting &s;ome altars, whereunto they might repair in common, and pour forth public expre&s;&s;ions of grati|tude to their pretended deities. It mu&s;t therefore be evident, that a principle of wor&s;hip is deeply engraven upon the hearts of men. And herein, my friends, con&s;i&s;teth the peculiar excellence of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, in that it hath in&s;tructed us in the &s;imple and &s;piritual wor&s;hip of our God; which, di&s;encumbered of rites and unmeaning ceremonies, is worthy its di|vine Author; its po&s;itive in&s;titutions few and ea&s;y, di|rectly
<PB N="6" REF="031240_0020_0FEB808165ABFB60">
tending to the good of &s;ociety and refining the morals and manners of men. How inexcu&s;eable then &s;hall we be, who enjoy &s;uperior advantages, if we &s;uffer our&s;elves to neglect a duty which the very hea|thens &s;o punctually ob&s;erved!</P>
<P>It is true, the refinement of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy has &s;ug|ge&s;ted the ab&s;urdity of paying homage to a Being far exalted above all prai&s;e; who&s;e e&s;&s;ential glory and happine&s;s can neither be augmented nor dimini&s;hed by his creatures; yet let me a&s;k, whether the benefits re|ceived from a benefactor in any degree dimini&s;h the debt of gratitude and prai&s;e to him, in con&s;equence of our inability to make an adequate return? or not rather increa&s;e every ingenuous feeling, and prompt us to embrace every opportunity of publickly expre&s;&s;|ing the pure emotions of a grateful heart? God is doubtle&s;s too great to need our homage; yet is he too good not to accept it, when poured forth from a grate|ful heart, and is the native effu&s;ion of a pure mind? If pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency blind all &s;entiments of de|pendence upon God, no wonder if we adopt the &s;en|timents of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy; but if we con&s;ider him as he is, our Father and Friend, mu&s;t it not be accept|able to him to behold his creatures &s;uitably affected towards their Benefactor? a&s;&s;embling together to ex|pre&s;s their gratitude in common, and thereby nouri&s;h and increa&s;e the general &s;tock of benevolence and love? Are not &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions and affections as the&s;e immediately connected with all virtue? naturally tending to impre&s;s us with a &s;en&s;e of our dependence, increa&s;e our reverence and gratitude towards God, and charity and good-will towards his creatures?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="031240_0021_0FEB8084A05F3758"><HI>Secondly.</HI> If we con&s;ider public wor&s;hip as it re|&s;pects &s;ociety, we &s;hall there al&s;o doubtle&s;s find it of great importance. Whereever we turn our eyes, we behold a bu&s;y world; immer&s;ed in the things of time and &s;en&s;e, making provi&s;ion for the pre&s;ent life; and were it not for &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons of wor&s;hipping God, and thus calling off their attention from worldly pur&s;uits, we have rea&s;on to believe that a &s;en&s;e of duty and fu|turity would be in a mea&s;ure era&s;ed from the mind. If it be of con&s;equence to the well-being of &s;ociety that &s;uch a belief &s;hould prevail, as an Almighty Be|ing in the heavens, who &s;urveys and governs all be|low; from whom none can e&s;cape, and to whom the mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;ins mu&s;t be accounted for; that he is a protector of the righteous, and a revenger of crimes; if it be nece&s;&s;ary that the thoughts of men be rai&s;ed and carried forward to the day of judgment; &s;urely then it mu&s;t enforce the authority of public wor&s;hip, and prove the nece&s;&s;ity of public in&s;truction: Man|kind being doomed to labour, and &s;o early engaged therein, that were it not for tho&s;e public re&s;orts where they hear of GOD and CHRIST, of judgment and eter|nity, they would doubtle&s;s fail in moral improvement, &s;ociability and friend&s;hip. Shut tho&s;e temples in which they a&s;&s;emble for religious in&s;truction and im|provement, and a declen&s;ion of religion, of morals and manners, would probably &s;oon appear. And as a &s;en&s;e of Deity and a future judgment were lo&s;t upon the mind, they would be prone to every outrage which they could commit with impunity.</P>
<P>It is well known that in the earlier ages of the world legi&s;lators were obliged to have recour&s;e to religion, in order to a&s;&s;ociate their &s;ubjects and give a &s;anction to
<PB N="8" REF="031240_0022_0FEB808973324708">
their laws. Thus bringing them together at &s;tated times to unite in acts of wor&s;hip, gradually tended to civilize the mind, cement the affections, and reduce them to order. And even at the pre&s;ent day, exclu&s;ive of any effect upon the moral principle, it is not to be doubted but a&s;&s;embling together contributes greatly to pro|mote order and decency, as well as charity and good affections. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be agreeable to every humane mind to think that one day in &s;even is allotted for re&s;t, and to join with others of the &s;ame mortal &s;tock in devout meditation, and the reverential wor&s;hip of their common Lord. It is the only time which gives inferiors to feel an equality with the great. When wor&s;hipping in the &s;ame temple, and acknowl|edging the &s;ame common Parent, then it is that man meets man as a brother; that he is led to realize that as the pre&s;ent day is, &s;o al&s;o &s;hall be the future; that one day they &s;hall &s;leep together undi&s;tingui&s;hed in the grave, and alike moulder into du&s;t; that the &s;ame Almighty Sovereign &s;hall receive their &s;pirits, and judge them by their works! Such reflections as the&s;e tend to humble the pride of man; and thus by reduc|ing him to a level with man, he thinks as a man, con|ducts as a Chri&s;tian, and thereby &s;ecures and promotes the good of &s;ociety. But I proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>&mdash;To con&s;ider public wor&s;hip as it re&s;pects individuals. And here we &s;hall find al&s;o its utility and importance no le&s;s than in the former ca&s;e. What|ever be the &s;tation of individuals, they are &s;till men, and as &s;uch have the duties of a man to perform. Were their attendance on public wor&s;hip of no other &s;ervice than to give &s;anction to a &s;alutary in&s;titution, this alone would make it their duty. But this is not
<PB N="9" REF="031240_0023_0FEB808AFB6B0F40">
all. If it be nece&s;&s;ary for man to pre&s;erve and increa&s;e his own &s;tock of virtue, it mu&s;t be of con&s;equence up|on his own account. It cannot be denied but attend|ance on public ordinances naturally tends to call off men's attention from the world, and to &s;olemnize the mind. And &s;o far as the impre&s;&s;ions are good, &s;o far its u&s;e and importance mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>All Chri&s;tian in&s;titutions have a tendency to pro|mote virtue. They &s;erve to give warmth to piety, lu&s;tre to virtue, and dignity to man. Hence the&s;e oc|ca&s;ional retreats from the cares and anxieties of life give opportunity for better thoughts to ari&s;e. The body is hereby refre&s;hed, the faculties of the mind en|livened, and both enabled to perform their functions with greater activity and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But perhaps here it may be urged with too much truth, Are there not many who are punctual in their attendance upon public ordinances, and appear to de|rive no benefit from them? Are they more improved in their moral conduct, and the di&s;charge of the com|mon duties of life, than others who have apparently neglected the &s;ervices of the church?</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer; Should this argument be ad|mitted it can prove no more than that human weak|ne&s;s and corruption may defeat the be&s;t purpo&s;es and mo&s;t promi&s;ing means for moral improvement. Doubtle&s;s the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings conferred upon men may be abu&s;ed, and by perver&s;ene&s;s converted into evil. But &s;hall we neglect the &s;ervice of the &s;anctuary becau&s;e we have not di&s;covered in others all that good effect which we wi&s;hed or expected? Shall we refu&s;e proper nouri&s;hment to the body becau&s;e others have indulged to exce&s;s? But though we cannot di&s;cover
<PB N="10" REF="031240_0024_0FEB808E790146E8">
every de&s;ired effect, it were pre&s;umption to conclude that no good is effected; &s;ince it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible accurately to determine how perver&s;e they would oth|erwi&s;e have been. It is doubtle&s;s a ju&s;t remark, that the manners as well as the morals of men keep pace with their religious improvements. Where public wor&s;hip is neglected, factions generally &s;pring up; and with great &s;imilarity in morals and manners ex|hibit the melancholy picture which Solomon de&s;cribes by the field of the &s;lothful. "I went by the field of the &s;lothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of under&s;tanding, and lo it was all grown over with thorns; and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the &s;tone wall thereof was broken down. Then I &s;aw and con&s;idered it well; I looked upon it, and received in&s;truction." It is not to be doubted but attention to public wor&s;hip tends to check licentiou&s;ne&s;s of thought; and that &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance is always afforded to good di&s;|po&s;itions. Even momentary impre&s;&s;ions of &s;erious med|itation are not without their fruit. They generally leave &s;ome traces of good behind; and being fre|quently repeated by religious acts of wor&s;hip, we have rea&s;on to hope, through divine grace, will make la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions upon the mind.</P>
<P>But as our a&s;&s;embling together in the hou&s;e of God is for the purpo&s;es of &s;ocial wor&s;hip, and to hear re|ligious in&s;truction, we ought to remember with what frame of mind it becomes us to attend. It is not the form of wor&s;hip or pretended &s;anctity of men which God regards; but the devout wor&s;hipper, the humble mind and &s;incere heart. By the inattentive thought and wandering eye we profane the temple of the Lord. And while with irreverence and inattention we join in
<PB N="11" REF="031240_0025_0FEB8091AA679F10">
the &s;olemnities of wor&s;hip, we di&s;honour God and fru&s;|trate the ends for which we ought to a&s;&s;emble. Re|ligious knowledge then fails, and the con&s;equence is, we return more guilty than we went. All religious knowledge comes from God. It is a light from heav|en, which becomes us with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s to acknowl|edge and regard. When we enter the hou&s;e of God to inquire in his temple, then it is in a more e&s;pecial manner he expects from us an attentive ear and up|right heart; to hear and apply the important truths of the go&s;pel, as well knowing by the contents thereof we mu&s;t be tried another day. But too often it is to be feared we a&s;&s;emble with other views; either in conformity to common cu&s;tom, or to critici&s;e upon the preacher. But the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions are both deroga|tory to man and the &s;olemnity of the place. It is with humility and candour, a de&s;ire to apply and improve, which ought to induce us to hear the word of God. Whenever therefore we enter the &s;acred temple, let us con&s;ider our&s;elves as creatures &s;urrounded with darkne&s;s, &s;eeking illumination from the Father of lights; as guilty creatures, imploring forgivene&s;s from our Judge; as frail and dying creatures, preparing for that eternal &s;tate into which we know not how &s;oon we may enter. If with &s;uch &s;entiments and di&s;po&s;i|tions we attend the wor&s;hip and ordinances of God, we may comfortably hope, through the merits of Chri&s;t, to join hereafter the nobler &s;ociety of wor|&s;hippers in the heavens.</P>
<P>But before I conclude, it may not be improper to addre&s;s the Proprietors and Wor&s;hippers of this place. Your pious zeal for the wor&s;hip of your Maker does you immortal honour! Your union and per&s;everance for e&s;tabli&s;hing the ordinances of God among you,
<PB N="12" REF="031240_0026_0FEB8094D9E82BF0">
and the erection of this magnificent Temple for that purpo&s;e, ju&s;tly merit our commendation. And as you have this day Dedicated it unto God, let it al&s;o be your care to devote your&s;elves to his wor&s;hip and &s;er|vice. You have heard &s;omething of the u&s;e and im|portance of public wor&s;hip, as al&s;o of the frame of mind with which it becomes you to attend; and we would charitably hope, from your laudable exertions, you can cheerfully adopt, with much &s;incerity of &s;oul, the language of the text: "One thing have I de&s;ired of the Lord, that will I &s;eek after; that I may dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple." If this be the language of your hearts, happy are ye; and while you continue it, happy &s;hall you be. While you thus attend the wor&s;hip of your God, you have nothing to fear; for he hath never &s;aid to any of the children of men, Seek ye me in vain.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xlv.19.</NOTE> But that he loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxxxviii.2.</NOTE> and that the prayer of the upright is his delight. Our Saviour al&s;o hath a&s;&s;ured us, that where two or three are gathered together in his name, that he is in the mid&s;t of them.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xviii.20.</NOTE> Let there|fore the word of God be your comfort and your guide. Enter his gates with thank&s;giving, and his courts with prai&s;e, delighting your&s;elves to inquire in his temple.</P>
<P>But while we exhort you to the practice of your duty, we cannot forbear to drop with you the friendly tear! The lo&s;s you have &s;u&s;tained by the death of a benefactor you doubtle&s;s feel.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mr. ISAIAH BAKER, a principal proprietor in the hou&s;e, died before it was fini&s;hed, and was the fir&s;t buried there. A man of large property, ex|ten&s;ive charity and a public &s;pirit.</NOTE> His pious zeal for
<PB N="13" REF="031240_0027_0FEB809A025B4580">
the glory of God, and the perfecting of this Hou&s;e, ought to endear him to your memory; and though not permitted to join us here in acts of wor&s;hip and devotion, we humbly tru&s;t he is now on high, wor|&s;hipping God in purer &s;trains! May his virtues long live, as a comfort and example for &s;urviving friends. May his death admoni&s;h you that you are al&s;o mortal; cement your union; &s;trengthen the bonds of friend|&s;hip, and animate you in your Chri&s;tian cour&s;e.</P>
<P>A word to this A&s;&s;embly &s;hall fini&s;h the Di&s;cour&s;e. And how &s;hall I &s;peak? For to &s;ome of you I &s;hall doubtle&s;s &s;peak no more! You as well as I, are can|didates for a future exi&s;tence! travellers for a day to an eternal home, and know not how &s;oon you may arrive there. On the rapid wings of time you are now pa&s;&s;ing, and very &s;oon with &s;ome of you the &s;cene will be &s;hifted! Very &s;oon, from wor&s;hipping God here below, you may be &s;ummoned to meet him in the heav|ens, to give account of your pilgrimage on the earth! Here you have no continuing city nor &s;ure abiding place; but are &s;eeking one to come, who&s;e builder and maker is God. Does not rea&s;on and revelation admoni&s;h you of the&s;e &s;olemn truths, and every thing around you &s;olemnize the call? Our fathers! where are they? and the prophets, do they live forever? Long &s;ince have they obeyed the &s;ummons, and enter|ed upon their reward! And in a little time, as they have done, we al&s;o mu&s;t quit the &s;tage, and leave our places to &s;ucceeding pilgrims! Does it not therefore concern you, as rational and accountable beings, to meditate upon and apply the truths which have been &s;ugge&s;ted? Is it a &s;mall thing to di&s;regard religion, and an&s;wer it to your Maker? To neglect divine in&s;titu|tions
<PB N="14" REF="031240_0028_0FEB809B88E148F0">
and the wor&s;hip of the &s;anctuary&punc; when every thing which concerns you as men is built upon it? Succe&s;s in the pre&s;ent world, peace of mind, and hap|pine&s;s in the next, are through Je&s;us Chri&s;t the natu|ral fruit of obedient lives. Means are in order to the end. If then a ble&s;&s;ed immortality be the object of your pur&s;uit, con&s;ider now in time the part which be|comes you to act. If with this view you de&s;ire to dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord and to inquire in his tem|ple, that &s;o you may know his will and your duty, "keep thy foot when thou come&s;t thither." Hear as for your life, remembering the omni&s;cience of God, and the &s;olemn account you mu&s;t one day give of your|&s;elves to him!</P>
<P>May the almighty Spirit of God dwell richly in your hearts, and guide you in the way of all truth. And though I mu&s;t now bid you adieu, as probably to join no more in acts of wor&s;hip and devotion upon the earth, yet, guided by light and truth through this wil|derne&s;s of life, may we meet again in the heavenly Je|ru&s;alem, to wor&s;hip our common Lord in nobler &s;trains. And may the day &s;oon dawn when "all &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth;" when the kingdoms of the world &s;hall become the kingdoms of our Lord, and the whole earth be filled with his glory.</P>
