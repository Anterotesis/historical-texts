<P>_THAT GOD, the &s;ource of being and perfection, who created all things for him&s;elf, exerci&s;es a wi&s;e, a ju&s;t, an univer&s;al government and providence over all his crea|tures and all his works, is a truth too evident, from the light of nature, to be di&s;|puted, too clearly revealed, explained and in|forced&punc; in the &s;acred oracles, to need any proof.</P>
<P>THAT this world and all that is in it, are un|der his direction and government,&mdash;that man|kind have been his peculiar care, the experience of all preceeding ages abundantly proves.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010856_0004_0F8C690CED830040">TO lead mankind to &s;ee the ju&s;tice and equity of divine government, to give a general idea of the cour&s;e of divine providence, towards &s;tates and kingdoms, as well as individuals, is evident|ly one important end of <HI>all</HI> hi&s;tory, whether &s;a|cred or profane. And as the divine conduct has been generally the &s;ame, to people of the &s;ame temper and character, in all pa&s;t ages of the world, <HI>facts</HI> and <HI>events,</HI> truly recorded and faith|fully pre&s;erved in hi&s;tory, are of no &s;mall advan|tage to &s;ucceeding generations.&mdash;They happily point out the errors into which &s;ome have run, and the rocks upon which they have been &s;hip|wreck'd,&mdash;they clearly exhibit the mea&s;ures by which others have ro&s;e to a &s;tate of glory and happine&s;s, &s;carcely to be conceived of, in a &s;tate of imperfection; and &s;o give the wi&s;dom and experience of ages pa&s;t, for the direction and improvement of tho&s;e that &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>AMONG the various hi&s;tories with which the world has been favoured, as none is of earlier date, none is furni&s;hed with events, or examples, more intere&s;ting, entertaining, or u&s;eful, than the <HI>Scriptures of Truth.</HI> &mdash; Here we have a mo&s;t &s;imple, familiar, and (yet) &s;triking repre&s;entation of the conduct of the &s;upreme ruler of the world, towards his &s;aints and &s;ervants&mdash;towards his cho&s;en people and their immediate enemies, and towards the world of mankind.&mdash;Here we have (as far as is nece&s;&s;ary for us to know) the grounds and rea&s;ons of the divine conduct, to|wards nations and kingdoms, and individuals, together with the ends propo&s;ed by providence therein. And there is &s;carcely any thing men|tion'd

<P>THE part of &s;acred writ, which has now been read, with the pa&s;&s;age of hi&s;tory with which it is connected, pre&s;ents us with a &s;cene of mea&s;ures, truly worthy the character of tho&s;e that pur&s;ued them, and &s;uited, at once, to engage the atten|tion, excite the admiration and encourage the emulation of per&s;ons of the &s;ame character and &s;tations in life.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age gives account of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI>'s acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of <HI>Judah,</HI> and of the mea&s;ures taken, by him and his loyal people, to &s;trengthen him again&s;t his enemies, to confirm him in his kingdom, and to render his reign ea&s;y to him&s;elf and happy to his people.</P>
<P>THE latter part of the preceeding reign, had been clouded with &s;everal in&s;tances of weak and bad policy, quite unworthy a king, who&s;e gene|ral character had been really great and good:&mdash; By rea&s;on of which, the kingdom was left in a &s;tate, &s;omewhat broken and perplex'd.&mdash;No &s;ooner was <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> &s;eated on the throne, but his care was to &s;et things right in the kingdom, and put the &s;tate into a po&s;ture of defence.&mdash;<HI>He placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and &s;et garri&s;ons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Context ver. 2.</NOTE></P>

a terror to it's enemies.&mdash;They are now glad to appear as tributaries to <HI>Judah,</HI> and making rich pre&s;ents to <HI>Jeho&s;haphat,</HI> to accept the terms of peace, at his hands.

<P>BUT, not enough that tranquility was re&s;tored and the kingdom in a re&s;pectable &s;tate, this pru|dent king and this loyal people are for improv|ing the happy opportunity of peace and re&s;t, more effectually to provide for every event.</P>
<P>THE king, as he waxes great, continues to improve and provide for the &s;afety, &s;upport and defence of his people.&mdash;<HI>He built ca&s;tles in Judah and cities of &s;tone</HI>; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 12.</NOTE> and wi&s;ely encouraged a martial &s;pirit, and expertne&s;s in the knowledge and u&s;e of arms.&mdash;The people, who&s;e hearts were united to their &s;overeign, were far from being backward in &s;o wi&s;e a mea&s;ure. Men of the be&s;t character and greate&s;t influence, chear|fully follow the illu&s;trious example, and, at the head of the thou&s;ands of their brethren, appear in arms, to cultivate, to inform them&s;elves (more fully) in the art of war. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P>THIS, indeed, has been the manner of mo&s;t of the &s;tates and nations, in the world.&mdash;Even the mo&s;t warlike and politic,&mdash;nations that have been victorious in arms,&mdash;&s;tates that have tri|umph'd in war, been the &s;courge of their ene|mies, and a terror to the world of mankind, have not been, always, able to re&s;i&s;t the force of &s;o plea&s;ing a charm, or free them&s;elves from the effects of &s;o fatal a mi&s;take.</P>
<P>A MAN, or a people, mu&s;t know but little of the true temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mankind,&mdash; but little of what has happened from the begin|ning, to &s;tates and kingdoms, in con&s;equence of remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, in times of peace and tranquility, not to &s;ee the wi&s;dom and nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch provident &s;teps,&mdash;not to know, that the mo&s;t potent and re&s;pectable &s;tate, in perfect tranquility and the height of pro&s;perity, may &s;oon be di&s;turbed, by it's enemies, and, if in a defencele&s;s condition, quickly reduced to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s,&mdash;to the brink of de&s;truction.</P>

<P>REASON and under&s;tanding were given, to teach men the unalterable difference between right and wrong, ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice.&mdash;Con&s;ci|ence was implanted, in the human brea&s;t, to in|force to a behaviour, becoming the character of moral agents,&mdash;to excite to a conduct, towards others, agreable to the fitne&s;s of things, to the eternal rules of ju&s;tice and equity; and to &s;uch a treatment of all, as &s;hould expre&s;s as &s;acred a regard to the rights and liberties of others, as unto their own.

<P>IN the mean time, it is happy for mankind, that, partly from nece&s;&s;ity, and partly for mutual &s;afety and defence, they have been led, by pro|vidence, to form them&s;elves into &s;ocieties; to the end, that, as far as the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things will admit, the evils, that might ari&s;e from a different &s;tate, might be prevented, the natural and common rights of mankind pre&s;erved, and the ble&s;&s;ings, re&s;ulting therefrom, more freely and univer&s;ally enjoyed.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, that, as one important end of &s;ociety, is protection and defence, every mea|&s;ure,

every &s;tep, conducive to this end, tends to the peace and happine&s;s of mankind. This, therefore, ju&s;tifies the conduct and mea&s;ures of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> and the people of <HI>Judah,</HI> upon the mo&s;t rational principles, and &s;ets them in the cleare&s;t point of light, as wi&s;e and good,&mdash; wor|thy the king and people which pur&s;ued them, and as an example not unworthy the emulation of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious princes and re&s;pectable &s;tates.

<P>THE di&s;po&s;ition, principles, conduct and cha|racter of the people of <HI>Judah,</HI> who &s;o cordially and univer&s;ally concurred with their &s;overeign, in the&s;e wi&s;e mea&s;ures, for the general &s;afety and happine&s;s of the kingdom, are not unworthy peculiar notice. <HI>The heads of the people, with the multitude of their brethren, willingly offered them|&s;elves unto the LORD, with their arms, as ready prepared for the war.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. text. and ver. &s;eq.</NOTE></P>
<P>AS it was now a time of peace and tranquility, with the kingdom of <HI>Judah,</HI> it is evident they could not have in view any immediate enter|prize again&s;t their enemies: They had none to encounter. An offen&s;ive war (unle&s;s by &s;pecial direction from heaven) could never be ju&s;tified, upon principles of rea&s;on and equity: This could not, therefore, be the de&s;ign of a king, who had made GOD his guide, and religion his care; or of a people who were taught the law of the

For the&s;e rea&s;ons, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that, as to revive and encourage a truly martial &s;pirit, and put the kingdom in the be&s;t &s;tate of defence, were the ends immediately in view, martial exerci&s;es, and the cultivation of the u&s;e of weapons of defence, and of the know|ledge of the art of war, was the &s;ervice to which they offered them&s;elves; that, in this way, they might become a terror to their enemies, and keep them at a di&s;tance:&mdash;Or, if any &s;hould dare to in&s;ult, or di&s;turb their peace, they might meet with the fate they ju&s;tly de&s;erved.</P>
<P>AND, verily, this is a &s;ervice of no &s;mall im|portance to a nation, or a &s;tate, to pre&s;erve peace, when enjoy'd, as well as to reduce an enemy to rea&s;on and equitable terms of peace, when at war.&mdash;A &s;ervice, therefore, that ought, at all times, and by all &s;tates, to have a proper attention paid unto it.</P>
<P>WHEN once a martial &s;pirit &s;inks, and &s;kill in military exerci&s;es and warlike accompli&s;hments are held in contempt, the art of war and u&s;e of arms neglected, among a people, they are ex|po&s;ed to the in&s;ults of every invader, are an ea&s;y prey to their weake&s;t enemies, and, like <HI>Lai&s;h</HI> of old, &s;eem to be marked out, in providence, for &s;peedy de&s;truction.

<P>VALOUR, or true fortitude, is that virtue, by which men are enabled to pre&s;erve pre&s;ence of mind, to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves fully, think clearly, judge wi&s;ely and act with calmne&s;s, firmne&s;s and re&s;olution, in times of great confu&s;ion and tu|mult, in the mid&s;t of mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing dangers and perplexing di&s;tre&s;&s;es. A virtue which excites to the noble&s;t actions, &s;timulates to the bolde&s;t en|terprizes, which rea&s;on dictates, judgment di|rects, or duty calls them to engage in.&mdash;But, then, it is carefully to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from ra&s;hne&s;s, pre&s;umption, fury and madne&s;s; which, in con&s;equence of fal&s;e notions of this virtue, or &s;ucce&s;s attending &s;uch unnatural and unrea&s;ona|ble exertions, too often gain applau&s;e, and take the name of Valour. But the difference be|tween them, is very great,&mdash;the &s;ame as between rea&s;on and pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ound judgment and mad|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>TRUE <HI>Valour</HI> is, therefore, to be con&s;idered as a moral virtue, having rea&s;on for it's founda|tion, and religion for it's encouragement and &s;upport. And where courage, valour or forti|tude, has rea&s;on for it's ba&s;is, and is encouraged, cultivated and &s;upported, by the principles of religion, it becomes a virtue of the highe&s;t rank, and prompts and leads men on to the mo&s;t he|roic

<P>THE want of true fortitude, is always attended with di&s;grace and reproach, frequently with &s;hameful defeats, and &s;ometimes with total de|&s;truction. But, in&s;pired with this virtue, a man may engage the bolde&s;t rival, in arms, and per|form the mo&s;t glorious exploits.</P>
