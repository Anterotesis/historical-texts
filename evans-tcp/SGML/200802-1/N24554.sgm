<P>MANLIUS, The Roman dictator, having exerci&s;ed great violence and cruelty over the citizens, was cited at the expiration of his office to an&s;wer for his conduct.

After they had &s;aluted each other, young Manlius de&s;ired a private conference; and as &s;oon as he &s;aw him&s;elf alone with the tribune, he drew out his dagger, pre&s;ented it to his brea&s;t, and declared he would &s;tab him that moment, if he did not &s;wear in the form he &s;hould dictate, "Never to hold the a&s;&s;embly of the people for accu&s;ing his father." Pompon|ius, who &s;aw the dagger glittering at his brea&s;t, him&s;elf alone without arms, and attacked by a robu&s;t young man, full of a bold confidence in his own &s;trength, took the oath demanded of him, and afterwards confe&s;&s;ed, with a kind of complacency in the thing, and a &s;incerity which &s;ufficiently argued he was not &s;orry for what he had done, that it was that violence which obliged him to de&s;i&s;t from his enter|prize.</P>

With this booty he made off to a di&s;tant part of the country, where he had rea&s;on to believe that neither he nor his ma&s;ter were known.

<HEAD>GAMING.</HEAD>
<P>THE late colonel Daniel, who took great plea&s;ure in giving advice to young officers, guiding them in their militay functions, the management of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp;c. whenever he was upon the article of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">aming, he u&s;ed al|ways to tell the following &s;tory of him&s;elf, as a warning to others, and to &s;hew that a little re&s;olution may conquer this ab&s;urd pa&s;&s;ion. In Queen Anne's wars, he was an en&s;ign in the Engli&s;h army then in Spain: but he was &s;o ab&s;olutely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by this evil, that all duty, and every thing el&s;e that prevented his gratify|ing his darling pa&s;&s;ion, was to him mo&s;t griev|ous: he &s;carcely allowed him&s;elf time for re&s;t; or if he &s;lept, his dreams pre&s;ented packs of cards to his eyes, and the rattling of dice to his ears:&mdash;his meals were neglected, or if he at|tended them, he looked upon that as &s;o much lo&s;t time; &s;wollowed his meat with precipit|ance, and hurried to the dear gaming-table a|gain. In one word; he was a profe&s;&s;ed game|&s;ter. For &s;ome time, fortune was his friend: and he was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that he has often &s;pread his winnings on the ground, and roll|ed him&s;elf on them, in order that it might be &s;aid of him, "he wallowed in gold." Such was his life for a con&s;iderable time; but as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ath often &s;aid, and I dare &s;ay every con&s;ider|ate man will join with him, "it was the mo&s;t mi&s;erable part of it."&mdash;After &s;ome time he was ordered on the recruiting duty, and at Bar|celona
<PB N="8" REF="032500_0008_0FF2FAE0E77D3508">
he rai&s;ed one hundred and fifty recruits for the regiment; though this was left entirely to his &s;erjeant, that he might be more at lei&s;|ure to attend to his darling pa&s;&s;ion. After &s;ome changes of good and ill-luck, fortune declared &s;o openly again&s;t him, that in one unlucky run, he was totally &s;tript of the la&s;t farthing. In this di&s;tre&s;s he applied to a cap|tain of the &s;ame regiment with him&s;elf, for a loan of ten guineas; which was refu&s;ed with this &s;peech, "What! lend my money to a profe&s;&s;ed game&s;ter! No, Sir, I mu&s;t be ex|cu&s;ed: for of nece&s;&s;ity I mu&s;t lo&s;e either my money or my friend; I therefore choo&s;e to keep my money." With this taunting refu&s;|al he retired to his lodging, where he threw him&s;elf on the bed, to lay him&s;elf and his &s;or|rows to a momentary re&s;t, during the heat of the day. A bug, gnat, or &s;ome &s;uch vermin, happening to bite him, he awoke; when his melancholy &s;ituation immediately pre&s;ented it&s;elf to him. Without money! and no pro&s;|pect how to get any to &s;ub&s;i&s;t him&s;elf and his recruits to the regiment, then at a great di&s;t|ance from him? and &s;hould they de&s;ert for want of pay, he mu&s;t be an&s;werable for it;&mdash;and he could expect nothing but ca&s;hiering for di&s;appointing the queen's &s;ervice. He had no friend, for he whom he had e&s;teemed &s;o had not only refu&s;ed to lend him money, but had added taunts to his refu&s;al. He had no ac|quaintance there! and &s;trangers he knew
<PB N="9" REF="032500_0009_0FF2FAE330CAD458">
would not let him have &s;o large a &s;um as was an&s;werable to his real nece&s;&s;ity. This natur|ally led him to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on what had in|duced him to commence game&s;ter, and this he pre&s;ently perceived was idlene&s;s. He had now found the cau&s;e, but the cure was &s;till wanting: how was that to be effected &s;o as to prevent a relap&s;e? Something mu&s;t be done, &s;ome method mu&s;t be pur&s;ued &s;o effect|ually to employ his time, as to prevent his having any to throw away at gaming. It then occurred to him, that the adjatancy of the re|giment was to be di&s;po&s;ed of, and this he de|termined to purcha&s;e, as a po&s;t the mo&s;t likely to find him a &s;ufficient and laudable way of pa&s;&s;ing his time. He had letter of credit to draw for what &s;um he plea&s;ed for his promo|tion in the army; but not to throw away idly, or to encourage his extravagancy. This was well: but the main difficulty remained, and he mu&s;t get to the regiment before he could take any &s;teps towards the intended purcha&s;e, or draw for the &s;um to make it with. While he was endeavouring to fall upon &s;ome expe|dient to extricate him&s;elf out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> his friend, who had refu&s;ed him in the morn|ing, came to pay him a vi&s;it.

<PB N="10" REF="032500_0010_0FF2FAE78542DCE0">
and the re&s;olution he had made of purcha&s;ing the adjutancy as &s;oon as he could join the re|giment: his friend then getting up and em|bracing him, &s;aid, "My dear Daniel, I refu&s;ed you in the morning in that abrupt manner in order to bring to a &s;en&s;e of the dangerous &s;it|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ation you were in, and to make you reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on the folly of the way of life you had got into. I heartily rejoice that it has had the de&s;ired effect. Pur&s;ue the laudible re&s;olu|tion you have made, for be a&s;&s;ured that IDLE|NESS AND GAMING ARE THE RUIN OF YOUTH. My intere&s;t, advice, and pur&s;e, are now at your command; there, take it, and plea&s;e your&s;elf with what is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;i&s;t your&s;elf and recruits to the regiment. This pre&s;ently bro't the colonel off the bed; and this afternoon's behaviour entirely obliterated the har&s;hne&s;s of his friend's morning refu&s;al; he now viewed him in the agreeble light of a &s;incere friend, and for ever after e&s;teemed, and found him &s;uch. In &s;hort, the colonel &s;et out with his recruits for the regiment, where he gained great applau&s;e for his &s;ucce&s;s, which, as well as his commi&s;&s;ion, he had well nigh lo&s;t by one morning's folly: he immediately &s;olicited for, and purcha&s;ed, the adjutancy; and from that day forward never touched cards or dice, but, as they ought to be u&s;ed, merely for diver&s;ion, or to unbend the mind after too clo&s;e an attention to &s;erious affairs.</P>

<HEAD>VICE AND VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the dancers of the palace in the reign of Abbas the great, king of Per&s;ia, there was a young maid named Idris, whom the ma&s;ter of the revels, on the report of her charms, had &s;ent for from Ca&s;bin to I&s;pahan. Her mother being of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he had followed the fame way of life: but as &s;he honorably di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf from her fe|male companions, &s;he demon&s;trated that vir|tue is practicable in every &s;ituation of life, however &s;lippery or dangerous it may be.</P>
<P>Scarcely had Idris appeared on the theatre of the capital, but &s;he found her&s;elf be&s;et by the grandees, who &s;trove to plea&s;e her by the &s;ame means that had won others in that &s;ta|tion. One exhau&s;ted all his rhetoric in com|mending her &s;hape and manner. Another extolled the form of her face, her complex|ion, and the regularity of her features. A third, to give weight to the encomiums he had be&s;towed on her voice, repeated an air he had heard her &s;ing, and declared his di&s;trac|tion to arrive at that grace with which &s;he gave life to the words. A fourth, boa&s;ting his preci&s;ion and &s;kill in dancing, exhibited in&s;tantly &s;ome of the attitudes he had learned of her. A fir&s;t-rate Sir Fopling gave her a li&s;t of the pretty women he had de&s;erted from the moment he fir&s;t &s;aw her. A young man, by birth entitled to become a Mollah, &s;ilently di&s;played his figure and his dre&s;s. An old
<PB N="12" REF="032500_0012_0FF2FAEBF9F0E6A8">
finger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r of the public money dazzled her eyes with a diamond of the fir&s;t water, and offer|ed it, be&s;ides the perqui&s;ites of the contracts, which it was his cu&s;tom to be&s;tow upon his mi&s;tre&s;s. An officer of the crown made a pompous de&s;cription of the pre&s;ents with which he had recompen&s;ed the friend&s;hip of the little Zaki. In fine, every one exerted his faculties and his addre&s;s in order to gain the preference over his rivals.</P>
<P>But Idris was not to be caught by &s;uch baits. At the palace, at a&s;&s;emblies, in the public walks, and in all places, the di&s;cour&s;e turned upon the new dancer. Every one talked of her beauty, her wit, and her en|gaging behaviour, and, which was more than they had &s;aid of any other of her profe&s;&s;ion, they agreed in acknowledging her to be very virtuous. It is the property of none but the mo&s;t exalted virtue to gain the re&s;pect and admiration of young courtiers. Mahmut con|ceived a high opinion of Idris's virtue, from the extraordinary effect it produced.</P>
<P>Mahmut bore among the lords of the court the &s;ame character which Idris maintained among the dancers of her &s;ex: proof again&s;t the defects of his equals, and the vices of his &s;tation. As &s;oon as he began to appear in the world, he became &s;en&s;ible of the ridicu|lou&s;ne&s;s of that noi&s;y, ob&s;treperous giddine&s;s, which mo&s;t young people of quality affect; and being happily, prejudiced again&s;t the idle

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he &s;aw them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ad, he took care not to follow their example, yet without &s;eeming to condemn them. While their days were divid|ed between the toilet, the table, vi&s;its, and gaming, he &s;pent the morning in his clo&s;et a|mong his books, or tho&s;e who&s;e conver&s;ation could in&s;truct him better. In the afternoon he frequented the manufactories and working places about the palace; talked with the able&s;t hands in the &s;everal arts; and ob&s;erved, with the utmo&s;t attention, how they proceeded in their works. In the evening he was at &s;ome or other of the public entertainments, which he enjoyed with a moderation that is ever in|&s;eparable from ta&s;te and di&s;cernment. After which he repaired to &s;ome of the mo&s;t brilliant a&s;&s;emblies of I&s;pahan, as well to avoid a &s;ingu|larity that would have rendered him odious, as to acquire a greater &s;hare of the complai|&s;ance and politene&s;s which reigned in them.&mdash;Mahmut's wit, and the u&s;e he made of it, ren|dered him &s;uperior to tho&s;e who were his e|quals in birth; and be&s;ides the advantage of a good figure and graceful air, he di&s;tingui&s;h|ed him&s;elf no le&s;s among them by his natural and acquired talents. Idris could not behold this amiable Per&s;ian without emotion: &s;he &s;hunned all her importunate &s;uitors, and com|placency fancying him free from all their faults, &s;he &s;ecretly wi&s;hed that the beauty which they had &s;o highly extolled might make an impre&s;&s;ion on him.

more than half way; Mahmut &s;oon let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> know that he loved her mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately, and her an&s;wer to his declaration, on account of its &s;ingularity, de&s;erves to be given entire.</P>
<P>"Doubtle&s;s you give the name of love." &s;aid &s;he, with a charming &s;mile, "to that which is only an effect of your ta&s;te for novel|ty; I will not my lord, go farther at pre&s;ent on this head; it is your bu&s;ine&s;s to fix my judgment. I will ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s, though it will give you &s;ome unfavourable opinion of me, if you are not the man I take you to be, that I am not di&s;plea&s;ed at your liking me.&mdash;But if ever I &s;ee occa&s;ion to alter the idea I have conceived of you, hope not that I &s;hall in the lea&s;t indulge my inclination.

<P>Mahmut &s;truck with admiration, and over|flowing with joy, loboured to ri&s;e to &s;uch a pitch as might oblige Idris to be con&s;tant to him. He applied him&s;elf with fre&s;h vigour to acquire the arts and &s;ciences nece&s;&s;ary for a man in his &s;tation. He made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to relieve indigent merit and unfortunate virtue. His humanity, genero&s;ity, capacity and mode&s;|ty, were equally con&s;picuous; and Idris abun|dantly rewarded him for all the pains he took to plea&s;e her. Prai&s;e, grounded on truth,
<PB N="15" REF="032500_0015_0FF2FAF56D4F7108">
and coming from the mouth of &s;o charming a per&s;on, filled the tender Mahmut's heart with joy and &s;atisfaction. He read in the eyes of his beauteous mi&s;tre&s;s how dear he was to her: he talked of his pa&s;&s;ion, and de&s;cribed its vio|lence. Idris li&s;tened to him with plea&s;ure, vowed &s;he would make him a ju&s;t return, and thus animated him to give her no occa&s;ion to repent her engagement. In the overflowings of their hearts, which none but true lovers can know and feel all the &s;weetne&s;s of, they laid open to each other the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of their &s;ouls. Mahmut was grieved when he took leave of Idris, nor could &s;he bear his ab|&s;ence without a vi&s;ible concern. They always parted under the greate&s;t impatience to meet again.</P>
<P>Between two neighbours &s;o powerful as the Grand Signior and the king of Per&s;ia, there can be no long peace: a war &s;oon broke out, and Mahmut was obliged to &s;et out for the ar|my. He waited upon Idris, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o deplore with her the dire nece&s;&s;ity that forced them a&s;un|der; but whil&s;t he lay at her feet he dur&s;t not di&s;clo&s;e to her all his grief.

Idris perceived the conflict in his brea&s;t, and loved him for it more inten&s;ely.</P>
<P>Mahmut had not been gone a month when he gave way to his de&s;ire of an interview with Idris. He &s;lipped away privately from the ar|my,

and with the help of relays, which he pro|vided on the road, he was at the gates of I&s;|pahan before they mi&s;ed him in the camp.&mdash;Alighting at the hou&s;e of one of his old &s;er|vants he di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the apparel of a pea&s;ant, that he might not be known in the city; and, impatient of an interview with his Idris, he flew to her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The charming maid was &s;itting at her bal|cony, as Mahmut was advancing, and knew him, notwith&s;tanding his di&s;gui&s;e. Grieved to &s;ee him thus neglect his glory and his duty, &s;he ran directly to her clo&s;et, charged her &s;lave to admit no vi&s;itor whatever. She melted in|to tears at the weakne&s;s of her lover; but &s;oon recovered her&s;elf, and wrote him the follow|ing billet:</P>

<HEAD>Idris to the pea&s;ant.</HEAD>
<P>"Friend, I know thou art to be forthwith at the army. Call upon Mahmut, and tell him from me that I de&s;ire him to remember the conditions on which the heart of Idris is to be &s;ecured."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mahmut was too much confounded with the&s;e words to a&s;k any que&s;tions of the &s;lave that delivered him the billet. He went back to his dome&s;tic's hou&s;e, to put off his di&s;gui&s;e; and fluctuating between admiration, grief, and fear, he repaired again to the army with as much ha&s;te as he had travelled up to I&s;pahan. His chief &s;tudy being to make amends for the fault he had committed, he behaved the re&s;t of
<PB N="17" REF="032500_0017_0FF2FAF9871E28A8">
the campaign with &s;o much ardour, bravery, and conduct, that he was de&s;ervedly promoted to a higher po&s;t, which the king conferred on him, with the mo&s;t honorable eulogies, at the head of the army. Idris wrote him a congat|ulatory letter on his promotion, in which with|out mentioning his weakne&s;s, &s;he gave him to under&s;tand that &s;he had forgiven him.</P>
<P>Mahmut, tran&s;ported with joy, ha&s;tened back to I&s;pahan, as &s;oon as the army was or|dered into winter-quarters, and li&s;tened to no other con&s;iderations but his e&s;teem for the virtuous girl: he entreated her to complete his happine&s;s in becoming his wife. "Your wife, my lord!" cried Idris, with an emotion that at once di&s;covered the tendere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion and concern for the glory of her lover;&mdash;"what! would Mahmut forget him&s;elf &s;o far? In di&s;po&s;ing of your heart you may indeed con&s;ult nothing but your inclinations; but when the que&s;tion is to choo&s;e a partner in your dignity and fortune, you hold both.

What will all Per&s;ia &s;ay, who&s;e eyes are, upon you, and who &s;ee nothing in me but the mean profe&s;&s;ion I was bred to? No, Mah|mut, it mu&s;t not be; I &s;ee my error, I am a&s;hamed of my weakne&s;s; I that am ready to &s;acrifice my life were it nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve your glory, cannot be in&s;trumental my&s;elf in &s;ullying it."</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="032500_0018_0FF2FAFE0C7842C0">
Sentiments like the&s;e made the pa&s;&s;ionate Mahmut only more pre&s;&s;ing. "What are tho&s;e things," &s;aid he, "which create &s;o great a di&s;parity between us? An in&s;tant may de|prive me of them; but the dowry which you will bring me charming Idris, is a ble&s;&s;ing that depends not on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">en nor fortune."

She could utter no more, tears put an end to her &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;topt her breath.</P>
<P>The news of their marriage &s;oon took wind, and tho&s;e who envied him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o much beauty, abu&s;ed him for his meanne&s;s; while the &s;ober and thinking part of the world extolled her virtues, and only lamented that her birth and fortune had not rendered them more con&s;picuous and attracting.

<PB N="20" REF="032500_0020_0FF2FB0148755FF0">
Lueretia's virtue, which &s;hould have com|manded re&s;pect, was the very thing which kindled in the brea&s;t of Sextus Tarquin a &s;trong and dete&s;table pa&s;&s;ion. Within a few days he returned to Collatia, and upon the plau&s;ible excu&s;e he made for his vi&s;it, he was received with all the politene&s;s due to a near relation, and the elde&s;t &s;on of a king. Watch|ing the fitte&s;t opportunity, he declares the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had excited at his la&s;t vi&s;it and em|ployed the mo&s;t tender intreaties, and all the artifices po&s;&s;ible to touch a woman's heart; but all to no purpo&s;e. He then endeavoured to extort her compliance by the mo&s;t terrible threatnings. It was in vain. She &s;till per&s;i&s;t|ed in her re&s;olution; nor could &s;he be moved, even by the fear of death. But, when the mon&s;ter told her, that he would fir&s;t di&s;patch her, and then having murdered a &s;lave, would lay him by her &s;ide, after which he would &s;pread a report, that having caught them in the act of adultery, he had puni&s;hed them as they de&s;erved; this &s;eemed to &s;hake her re&s;o|lution. She he&s;itated, not knowing which of the&s;e dreadful alternatives to take, whether, by con&s;enting to di&s;honor the bed of her hu&s;|band, whom &s;he tenderly loved; or, by refu&s;|ing, to die under the odious character of hav|ing pro&s;tituted her per&s;on to the lu&s;t of a &s;lave. He &s;aw the &s;truggle of her &s;oul; and &s;eizing the unluckly moment, obtained an inglorious conque&s;t. Thus Lucretia's virtue, which had

<P>On the morrow, Lucretia, overwhelmed with grief and de&s;pair, &s;ent early in the morn|ing to de&s;ire her father, and her hu&s;band to come to her, and bring with them each a tru&s;|ty friend, a&s;&s;uring them there was no time to lo&s;e.

Yes, Collatinus, thy bed has been defiled by a &s;tran|ger: but my body only is polluted; my mind is innocent, as my death &s;hall witne&s;s.

<P>If you a&s;k whence the&s;e happy qualities a|ri&s;e, I grant there was &s;ome foundations for them in his very nature, there was &s;omething of a complexional virtue mingled with his frame; but it is much more owing to the wi&s;e conduct of his parents from his very infancy, and the ble&s;&s;ings of Divine Grace attending their labours, their prayers, and their hopes.</P>
<P>He was trained up from the very cradle to all the duties of infant virtue, by the allure|ments of love and reward, &s;uited to his age; and never was driven to practice any thing by a frown or a ha&s;ty word, where it was po&s;&s;ible for kinder affections to work the &s;ame effect by indulgence and delay.</P>
<P>As fa&s;t as his rea&s;oning powers began to ap|pear and exert them&s;elves, they were conduct|ed in an ea&s;y track of thought, to find out and ob&s;erve the rea&s;onablene&s;s of every part of his duty, and the lovely character of a child obe|dient to rea&s;on and to his parents will; while every departure from duty was &s;hewn to be &s;o contrary to rea&s;on, as laid an early foundation

<P>When he became capable of conceiving of an Almighty and invi&s;ible Being, who made this world and every creature in it, he was taught to pay all due regard to God his Ma|ker; and from the outhority and love of his father on earth, he was led to form right ideas (as far as childhood permitted) of the power, government, and goodne&s;s of the univer&s;al and &s;upreme father of all in heaven.</P>
<P>He was informed why puni&s;hment was due to an offence again&s;t God or his parents, that his fear might become an u&s;eful pa&s;&s;ion to a|waken and guard his virtue; but he was in|&s;tructed, at the &s;ame time, that where he hear|tily repented of a fault, and returned to his duty with new diligence, there was forgive|ne&s;s to be obtained both of God and man.</P>

In his younger years he pa&s;&s;ed but twice under the correction of the rod; once for a fit of ob&s;tinacy and per&s;i&s;ting in a fal&s;ehood; then he was given up to &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement, and it di&s;pelled and cured the &s;ullen humour forever; and once for the contempt of his mother's authority he endured the &s;courge again, and he wanted it no more.</P>
<P>He was enticed &s;ometimes to the love of let|ters, by making his le&s;&s;on a reward of &s;ome dome&s;tic duty; and a permi&s;&s;ion to pur&s;ue &s;ome parts of learning was the appointed re|compence of his diligence and improvement in others.</P>
<P>There was nothing required of his memory but what was fir&s;t (as far as po&s;&s;ible) let into his under&s;tanding; and by proper images and repre&s;entations, &s;uited to his years, he was taught to form &s;ome conception to things de&s;|cribed, before he was bid to learn the words by heart.

each of them &s;uited to his more early or more improved capacity, till at twelve years old he was thought fit to learn that public form, which is more univer&s;ally taught and approv|ed.</P>
<P>As he was inured to rea&s;oning from his childhood, &s;o he was in&s;tructed to prove eve|ry thing, according to the nature of the &s;ub|ject, by natural or moral arguments, as far as years would admit: and thus he drew much of his early knowledge from rea&s;on or from revelation by the force of his judgment, and not merely from his teachers, by the &s;trength of his memory.</P>
<P>His parents were per&s;uaded indeed that they ought to teach him the principles of virtue while he was a child, and the mo&s;t important truth of religion both natural and revealed, be|fore he was capable of deriving them from the fund of his own rea&s;on, or of framing a religion for him&s;elf out of &s;o large a book as the Bible. They thought them&s;elves under the obliga|tion of that divine command, "Train up a child in the way that he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will nor depart from it." And therefore from a child they made him acquaint|ed with the Holy Scriptures, and per&s;uaded him to believe that they were given by the in|&s;piration of God, before it was po&s;&s;ible for him to take in the arguments from rea&s;on, hi&s;|tory, tradition, &amp;c. which mu&s;t be joined to|gether to confirm the &s;acred canon, and prove
<PB N="29" REF="032500_0029_0FF2FB1A02EDB5C8">
the &s;everal books of the Bible to be divine.&mdash;Thus, like Timothy, "he continued in the things which he learned, and had been a&s;&s;ured of knowing of whom he had learned them." Yet as his years advanced, they thought it re|qui&s;ite to &s;how him the &s;olid and rational foun|dations of his faith, that his hope might be built upon the authority of God, and not of men.</P>
<P>After he arrived at fifteen, he was &s;uffered to admit nothing into his full a&s;&s;ent, till his mind &s;aw the rational evidence of the propo|&s;ition it&s;elf; or at lea&s;t till he felt the power of tho&s;e rea&s;ons which obliged him to a&s;&s;ent, up|on moral evidence and te&s;timony, where the evidences of &s;en&s;e or of rea&s;on were not to be expected. He knew that he was not to hope for mathematical proofs that there is a pope at Rome, that the Turks have dominion over Ju|dea, that St. Paul wrote an Epi&s;tle to the Ro|mans, that Chri&s;t was crucified without the gates of Jeru&s;alem, and that in three days time he ro&s;e from the dead; and yet that there is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable evidence to enforce and &s;upport the belief of all the&s;e facts.

By this means he began early to u&s;e his rea&s;on with freedom, and to judge for him&s;elf, without a &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the authority of others; and yet to pay a ju&s;t and &s;olemn deference to per&s;ons of age and experience, and particularly to tho&s;e who were proper and appointed guides of his youth, and who led him on &s;o gently in the paths of knowledge.</P>

of Era&s;te, (the name of the lady his mo|ther) &s;he was frequent in the nur&s;ery, and in|&s;pired &s;entiments into his childhood becoming riper years. When there was company in the parlour, with whom &s;he could u&s;e &s;uch a a freedom, &s;he brought her &s;on in among them, not to entertain them with his own noi&s;e and tattle and impertinence but to hear their di&s;cour&s;e and &s;ometimes to an&s;wer a lit|tle que&s;tion or two they might a&s;k him. When he was grown up to a youth, he was often ad|mitted into the room with his father's acquaint|ance, and was indulged the liberty to a&s;k and enquire on &s;ubjects that &s;eemed to be above his years: he was encouraged to &s;peak a &s;entence or two of his own thoughts, and thus to learn and practi&s;e a mode&s;t a&s;&s;ureance. But when the company was gone, he was approved and prai&s;ed if he behaved well, or received kind hints of admonition that he might know when he had been too &s;ilent, and too forward to &s;peak. Thus, by enjoying the advantage of &s;ociety above the level of his own age and under&s;tanding, he was always a&s;piring to imita|tion; and the exce&s;&s;es and defects of his con|duct were daily noticed and cured.</P>

If he &s;ought any crimial plea&s;ures, or diver&s;ions attended with great danger and in|convenience, the pur&s;uit of them was ab&s;olute|ly forbidden; but it was done in &s;o kind a manner, as made the guilt or peril of them appear in the &s;tronge&s;t light, and thereby they were rendered hateful or formidable, rather than the objects of wi&s;h or de&s;ire.</P>
<P>When Eugenio fir&s;t began to go a broad in the world, his companions were recommend|ed to him by the prudence of his parents; or if he cho&s;e them him&s;elf, it was &s;till within the reach of his tutor's ob&s;ervation, or the notice of his father's eye: nor was he &s;uffer|ed to run aloo&s;e into promi&s;cuous company, till it appeared that his mind was furni&s;hed with &s;teady principles of virtue, till he had knowledge enough to defend tho&s;e principles, and to repel the a&s;&s;aults that might be made upon his faith and manners.</P>
<P>Yet it was hardly thought fit to tru&s;t him to his own conduct for whole days together, le&s;t he &s;hould meet &s;ome temptations too hard for his virtue, till he had gained re&s;olution enough to &s;ay <HI>no</HI> boldly, and to maintain an ob&s;tinate refu&s;al of pernicious plea&s;ures. He was told before hand how the profane and the lewd would u&s;e all the arts of addre&s;s, and how &s;ubtilely they would practi&s;e upon good hu|mour with powerful and tempting importuni|ties. This &s;et him ever upon his guard; and
<PB N="34" REF="032500_0034_0FF2FB28906937B8">
though he carried his &s;weetne&s;s of temper al|ways about with him, yet he learned to conceal it where&s;oever it was neither proper nor &s;afe to appear. By a little conver&s;e in the world, he found that it was nece&s;&s;ary to be po&s;itive, bold, and unmoveable in rejecting every pro|po&s;al which might endanger his character or his morals; e&s;pecially as he &s;oon became &s;en|&s;ible that a &s;oft and cold denial gave courage to new attacks, and left him liable to be tea&s;ed with fre&s;h &s;olicitations. He laid down this therefore for a con&s;tant rule, that where his rea&s;on had determined any practice to be either plainly &s;inful, or utterly inexpedient, he would give &s;o firm a denial, upon the principles of virtue and religion, as &s;hould for ever di&s;cour|age any farther &s;olicitations. This gave him the character of a man of re&s;olute virtue, even among the rakes of the time, nor was he ever e&s;teemed the le&s;s on this account. At fir&s;t in|deed he thought it a happy victory which he had gotten over him&s;elf, when he could defy the &s;hame of the face of vice and infidel|ity: he found the &s;horte&s;t way to conquer this fooli&s;h &s;hame was to renounce it at once; then it was ea&s;y to practice &s;ingularity amid&s;t a profane multitude. And when he began to get courage enough to profe&s;s re&s;olute piety without a blu&s;h, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch company as this, Agathus and Era&s;te then permitted their &s;on to travel abroad, and to &s;ee more of the world, under the protection of their daily

<P>In &s;hort, the re&s;traints of his younger years were tempered with &s;o much liberty, and ma|naged with &s;uch prudence and tenderne&s;s, and the&s;e bonds of di&s;cipline were &s;o gradually loo&s;ened as fa&s;t as he grew wi&s;e enough to govern him&s;elf, that Eugenio always carried about with him an inward conviction of the great love and wi&s;dom of his parents and his tutor. The humours of the child now and then felt &s;ome reluctance again&s;t the pious di&s;cipline of his parents; but now he is arriv|ed at man's e&s;tate, there is nothing that he looks back upon with greater &s;atisfaction than the &s;teps of their conduct, and the in&s;tances of his own &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He often recounts the&s;e things with plea&s;ure, as &s;ome of the chief favours of heaven, whereby he was guarded through all the dangers and follies of youth and childhood, and effectually kept, through Divine Grace opperating by the&s;e means, from a thou&s;and &s;orrows, and perhaps from everla&s;ting ruin.</P>
<P>Though he was relea&s;ed &s;ome years from the &s;trictne&s;s of parental government, yet he &s;till makes his parents his cho&s;en friends: and though they cea&s;e to practi&s;e authority upon him, and ab&s;olute command, yet he pays the

utmo&s;t deference to their coun&s;els, and to the fir&s;t notice of their inclinations. You &s;hall never find him re&s;i&s;ting and debating again&s;t their de&s;ires and propen&s;ities in little common things of life, which are indifferent in them|&s;elves; he thinks it carries in it too much contempt of tho&s;e whom God and nature re|quire him to honor. When&s;oever he enters into any important action of life, he takes a filial plea&s;ure to &s;eek advice from his worthy parents; and it is unea&s;y to him to attempt any thing of moment without it. He does not indeed univer&s;ally practi&s;e all their &s;entiments, but he gains their con&s;ent to follow his own rea&s;on and choice.</P>
<P>Some of the wild young gentlemen of the age may happen to laugh at him for being &s;o much a boy &s;till, and for &s;howing &s;uch &s;ubjection to the old folks, (as they call them:) with a &s;corn|ful &s;mile they bid him "Break off his leading-&s;trings and ca&s;t away his yokes of bondage." But for the mo&s;t part he ob&s;erves, that the &s;ame per&s;ons &s;hake off all yokes at once, and at once break the bonds of nature, duty, and religion: they pay but little regard to their &s;uperior in heaven, any more than tho&s;e on earth, and have forgotten God and their pa|rents together.

and the&s;e lectures.

<P>CALISTA was young and beautiful, ble&s;t with an uncommon &s;hare of &s;olid &s;en&s;e enliven|ed by the mo&s;t &s;prightly wit. Agathocles ex|ceeded her very little in point of age; he was well made, brave, and prudent. He had the good fortune to be introduced at Cali&s;ta's, where his looks, wandering indifferently over a brilliant circle, &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed and fixed upon her: but endeavouring to recover him|&s;elf from the &s;hort exta&s;y which his fir&s;t glance produced, he immediately reproached him&s;elf as being guilty of rudene&s;s and di&s;regard to the re&s;t of the company; and this fault he endeavoured to repair, by looking round upon other objects. Vain attempt! they are at|tracted
<PB N="39" REF="032500_0039_0FF2FB3734E1EB08">
by an irre&s;i&s;table charm, and again turned towards Cali&s;ta. He blu&s;hed as well as &s;he, whil&s;t a &s;weet emotion hitherto unfelt played about his heart and di&s;concerted all his looks. They both became at the &s;ame time more timid and more curious. With plea&s;ure he gazed at Cali&s;ta, and yet could not do it without trembling: whil&s;t &s;he, &s;ecretly plea&s;ed with this flattering preference, looked at him by &s;tealth. They were both afraid, but e&s;pe|cially Cali&s;ta, of being caught by the other in the fact, and both were &s;o almo&s;t every mo|ment. The hour of &s;eparation came, and they thought came too &s;oon. They made painful reflections on the rapidity of time. Imagina|tion, however, did not &s;uffer a total &s;eparation to take place: for the image of Cali&s;ta was deeply engraven on the mind of Agathocles, and the lineaments of his per&s;on were as &s;trong|ly impre&s;&s;ed on that of Cali&s;ta. They both appeared le&s;s cheerful the re&s;t of the day; a lively and intere&s;ting &s;entiment, whatever it was, employed their minds, which no amu&s;e|ment could bani&s;h. It was two days before they &s;aw each other again; and though dur|ing this interval their whole time had been filled up, either by bu&s;ine&s;s or recreations, they both felt a languid anxiety which render|ed every thing in&s;ipid, a void in their minds which we want words to define, and of which they knew not the cau&s;e; but di&s;covered it the very in&s;tant at their meeting; for the
<PB N="40" REF="032500_0040_0FF2FB39C8CFE3D0">
perfect contentment, the &s;oothing delight, which they ta&s;ted in the pre&s;ence of each oth|er, would not &s;uffer them to be longer ignorant of the cau&s;e of their melancholy. Agathocies now collected him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;umed the cour|age to addre&s;s Cali&s;ta; he acco&s;ted her with the mo&s;t polite and obliging expre&s;&s;ions, and for the fir&s;t time enjoyed the happine&s;s of a particular conver&s;ation with her. He had hitherto &s;een only her exterior charms: he now di&s;covered the beauties of her mind, the integrity of her heart, the dignity of her &s;enti|ments, and the delicacy of her wit; but what &s;till more delighted him, was the plea&s;ing hope that &s;he did not think him unworthy of her e&s;teem. From this time his vi&s;its became very frequent; in every one of which he di&s;|covered &s;ome new perfection. This is the characteri&s;tic of real merit; it is a gainer by being laid open to the in&s;pection of a judicious eye. A man of under&s;tanding will &s;oon be di&s;gu&s;ted with the wanton, the fooli&s;h, and the giddy: but if he has conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for a woman worthy of him&s;elf, time, &s;o far from weakening his attachment, can only &s;erve to increa&s;e and &s;trengthen it.</P>
<P>The fixed inclination of Agathocles made him now &s;en&s;ible, that which he felt for Ca|li&s;ta was love; and that of the mo&s;t tender and pa&s;&s;ionate kind. This he knew; but Cali&s;ta was &s;till unacquainted with it, or at lea&s;t had never learnt it from his lips. Love is timor|ous

and di&s;&s;ident: a bold and daring &s;uitor is not the lover of the lady he addre&s;&s;es; the only object of his love is <HI>plea&s;ure.</HI> At la&s;t he took the re&s;olution to lay open his heart to Cali&s;ta, but not in the &s;tudied language of a romantic pa&s;&s;ion. "Lovely Cali&s;ta," &s;aid he, "ingenuou&s;ly, it is not merely e&s;teem that en|gages me to you; but the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and tender affection. I feel that I cannot live with|out you. Can you without reluctance re&s;olve to make me happy? I have hitherto loved without offending you, this is a tribute which your merit demands; but may I flatter my|&s;elf with the hope, that you will make me &s;ome &s;mall return?" A coquette would have affected to be di&s;plea&s;ed; but Cali&s;ta not on|ly heard her lover without interruption, but an&s;wered him without &s;everity, and permitted him to hope. Nor did &s;he put his con&s;tancy to a needle&s;s trial. The happine&s;s for which he &s;ighed was deferred no longer than was proper, to make the nece&s;&s;ary preparations. The marriage-&s;ettlements were ea&s;ily adju&s;ted, for in the&s;e, &s;ordid intere&s;t had no &s;hare; this &s;olemn contract chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in a mutual exchange of hearts, and this was already per|formed. What will be the lot of this newly wedded pair? I will venture to foretel that it will be the happie&s;t that mortals can enjoy on earth. No plea&s;ure is comparable to that which affects the heart; nor does any o|ther affect it with &s;uch exqui&s;ite delight as the plea&s;ure of loving and being beloved. To

this tender union of &s;ouls we can never apply the words of Democritus, that "the plea&s;ure of love is only a &s;hort epilep&s;y."

This I dare prophe&s;y, and I know the cau&s;e: their pa&s;&s;ion is not founded on the dazzling charms of beauty, they are both the friends of virtue: they love each other on this account; their love, therefore, will la&s;t as long as their virtue, and the con|tinuance of that is &s;ecured by their union:&mdash;for nothing can &s;ecure our per&s;everance in the paths of wi&s;don &s;o effectually as having ince&s;&s;|antly a loving and beloved example walking before us.

<P>IT is to the victory over Antiochus, and the conque&s;t of A&s;ia, that Pliny dates the corrup|tion of the manners of the Roman common|wealth, and of the fatal change that happened in it by introducing at Rome, with the rich|es it brought thither, a ta&s;te for luxury and vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s. A&s;ia conquered Rome by its vices. Foreign riches put an end to the love of indu&s;try and the antient &s;implicity which had been the principles of its honor and &s;trength. Luxury, which entered Rome as in triumph, with the &s;uperb &s;poils of A&s;ia, brought with it in its train all kinds of di&s;or|ders and crimes, made more havock than the mo&s;t numerous armies could have done, and, in that manner avenged the conquered globe. Thus the face of the &s;tate was changed, vir|tue, valour, and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s were no longer e&s;teemed; the oppo&s;ite vices prevailed, and the government from ju&s;t and wi&s;e be|came tyrannical and in&s;upportable.</P>

<P>WHEN Damon was &s;entenced by Diony&s;ius of Syracu&s;e to die on a certain day, he begged permi&s;&s;ion, in the interim, to retire to his own country, to &s;et the affairs of his di&s;con&s;olate family in order. This the tyrant intended pe|remtorily to refu&s;e, by granting it, as he con|ceived, on the impo&s;&s;ible conditions of his pro|curing &s;ome one to remain as ho&s;tage for his return, under equal forfeiture of life. Pythi|as

as heard the conditions, and did not wait for an application upon the part of Damon; he in|&s;tantly offered him&s;elf as &s;ecurity for his friend, which, being accepted, Damon was immedi|ately &s;et at liberty. The king and all the courtiers were a&s;toni&s;hed at this action; and therefore when the day of execution drew near, his maje&s;ty had the curio&s;ity to vi&s;it Pythias in his confinement. After &s;ome con|ver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of friend&s;hip, in which the tyrant delivered it as his opinion that &s;elf|intere&s;t was the &s;ole mover of human actions; as for virtue, friend&s;hip, benevolence, love of one's country, and the like; he looked upon them as terms invented by the wi&s;e to keep in awe and impo&s;e upon the weak. "My lord," &s;aid Pythias, with a firm voice and noble a&s;|pect, "I would it were po&s;&s;ible that I might &s;uffer a thou&s;and deaths, rather than my friend &s;hould fail in any article of his honor. He cannot fail therein my lord: I am as confident of his virtue as I am of my own exi&s;tence.&mdash;But I pray, I be&s;eech the gods, to pre&s;erve the life and integrity of my dear Damon to|gether: oppo&s;e him, ye winds, prevent the eagerne&s;s and impatience of his honorable en|deavours, and &s;uffer him not to arrive till by my death I have redeemed a life a thou&s;and times of more con&s;equence, of more value, than my own; more e&s;timable to his lovely wife; to his precious little innocents, to his friends, to his country. O leave me not to

die the wor&s;t of deaths in my Damon." Dio|ny&s;ius was awed and confounded by the digni|ty of the&s;e &s;entiments, and by the manner in which they were uttered: he felt his heart &s;truck by a &s;light &s;en&s;e of invading truth;&mdash;but it &s;erved rather to perplex than undeceive him. The fatal day arrived. Pythias was brought forth, and walked amid&s;t the guards with a &s;erious, but &s;atisfied air, to the place of execution. Diony&s;ius was already there; he was exalted on a moving throne, that was drawn by &s;ix white hor&s;es, and fat pen&s;ive and attentive to the pri&s;oner. Pythias came, he vaulted lightly on the &s;caffold, and beholding for &s;ome time the apparatus of his death, he turned with a placid countenance, and addre&s;&s;|ed the &s;pectators: "My prayers are heard," he cried, "the gods are propitous; you know, my friends, that the winds have been contrary till ye&s;terday. Damon could not come, he could not conquer impo&s;&s;ibilites; he will be here to|morrow, and the blood which is &s;hed to-day, &s;hall have ran&s;omed the life of my friend. O could I era&s;e from your bo&s;om every doubt, every mean &s;u&s;picion, of the honor of the man for whom I am about to &s;uffer, I &s;hall go to my death even as I would to my bridal. Be it &s;ufficient in the mean time, that my friend will be found noble, that his truth is unimpeach|able; that he will &s;peadily prove it: that he is now on his way, hurrying on, accu&s;ing him|&s;elf, and adver&s;e elements, and the gods: but
<PB N="49" REF="032500_0049_0FF2FB55E1E4C5E8">
I ha&s;te to prevent his &s;peed; executioner, to your office." As he pronounced the la&s;t words, a buz began to ri&s;e among the remo|te&s;t of the people; a di&s;tant voice was heard; the croud caught the words, and Stop Stop the execution, was repeated by the whole a&s;&s;|embly: a man at full &s;peed; the throng gave way to his approach: he was mounted on a &s;teed of foam: in an in&s;tant he was off his hor&s;e, on the &s;caffold, and held Pythias &s;traitly embraced. "You are &s;afe," he cried, "you are &s;afe, my friend, my beloved friend, the gods be prai&s;ed, you are &s;afe. I now have nothing but death to &s;uffer and am delivered from the angui&s;h of tho&s;e reproaches which I gave my&s;elf, for having endangered a life &s;o much dearer than my own." Pale, cold, and half &s;peechle&s;s in the arms of his Damon, Pythias replied in broken accents&mdash;"Fatal ha&s;te!&mdash;Cruel impatience!&mdash;What envious powers have wrought impo&s;&s;ibilities in your favour?&mdash;But I will not be wholly di&s;appoint|ed.&mdash;Since I cannot die to &s;ave, I will not &s;urvive you." Diony&s;ius heard, beheld, and con&s;idered all with a&s;toni&s;hment. His heart was touched, he wept, and leaving his throne, he a&s;cended the &s;caffold. "Live, live, ye in|comparable pair!" he cried, "ye have borne unque&s;tionable te&s;timony to the exi&s;tence of virtue! and that virtue equally evinces the ex|i&s;tence of a God to reward it.

<P>MONIMA was a lady whom all Greece ad|mired, not &s;o much for her beauty, though confe&s;&s;edly exqui&s;ite, as for her wi&s;dom and prudence.

The &s;treets and the crowds of Mecca di&s;appeared; I found my&s;elf &s;itting on the declivity of a mountain, and perceived at my right hand an angel, whom I knew to be Arozan, the mini&s;ter of reproof.

<P>I looked up and beheld an inclo&s;ure, beauti|ful as the gardens of paradi&s;e, but of a &s;mall extent. Through the middle there was a green walk; at the end a wild de&s;art, and beyond im|penetrable darkne&s;s.

<HEAD>VIRTUE AND VICE.</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent citizen, who had lived in good fa&s;hion and credit, was, by a train of accidents, and by an unavoidable perplexity in his af|fairs, reduced to a low condition. There is a mode&s;ty u&s;uly attending faultle&s;s poverty, which made him rather choo&s;e to reduce his manner of living to his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, than &s;olicit his friends, in order to &s;upport the &s;hew of an e&s;tate, when the &s;ub&s;tance was gone. His wife, who was a woman of &s;en&s;e and vir|tue, behaved her&s;elf on this occa&s;ion with un|common decency, and never appeared &s;o ami|able in his eyes as now. In&s;tead of upbraid|ing him with the ample fortune &s;he had bro't, or the many great offers &s;he had refu&s;ed for his &s;ake, &s;he redoubled all the in&s;tances of her

He &s;ometimes came home at a time when &s;he did not expect him, and &s;urpri&s;ed her in tears; which &s;he endeavoured to conceal, and always put on an air of cheerfulne&s;s to re|ceive him.

This young woman was apprehen&s;ive of the ruin which was approaching, and had pri|vately engaged a friend in the neighbourhood to give her an account of what pa&s;&s;ed from time to time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her father's affairs. Amanda was in the bloom of her youth and beauty, when the lord of the manor, who often called in at the farmer's hou&s;e as he followed his country &s;ports, fell pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her. He was a man of great genero&s;ity, but from a loo&s;e education had contracted a hear|ty aver&s;ion to marriage. He therefore enter|tained a de&s;ing upon Amanda's virtue, which at pre&s;ent he thought fit to keep private.&mdash;The innocent creature, who never &s;u&s;pected his intentions, was plea&s;ed with his per&s;on, and having ob&s;erved his growing pa&s;&s;ion for her, hoped, by &s;o advantageous a match, &s;he might quickly be in a capacity for &s;upporting her im|poveri&s;hed relations. One day as he called to &s;ee her, he found her in tears over a letter &s;he

How could this barbarous man think that the tendere&s;t of parents would be tempted to &s;upply their wants by giving up the be&s;t of their children to infamy and ruin? It is a mean and cruel artifice to make this propo&s;al at a time when he thinks our nece&s;|&s;ities mu&s;t compel us to any thing; but we will not eat the bread of &s;hame, and therefore we charge thee not to think of us, but to a|void the &s;nare which is laid for thy virtue.&mdash;Beware of pitying us: it is not &s;o bad as you have perhaps been told.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER very much perplexity in my&s;elf, and revolving how to acquaint you with my own &s;entiments, and expo&s;tulate with you concerning yours, I have cho&s;en this way;&mdash;by which means I can be at once revealed to you, or, if you plea&s;e lie concealed. If I do not within a few days find the effect which I hope from this, the whole affair &s;hall be buri|ed in oblivion. But, alas! what am I going to do, when I am about to tell you that I love you? But after I have done &s;o, I am to a&s;&s;ure you, that with all the pa&s;&s;ion which ever en|tered a tender heart, I know I can bani&s;h you from my &s;ight forever, when I am convinced that you have no inclinations towards me but
<PB N="69" REF="032500_0069_0FF2FB905850BF28">
to my di&s;honor. But, alas! Sir why &s;hould you &s;acrifice the real and e&s;&s;ential happine&s;s of life to the opinion of a world, that moves upon no other foundation but profe&s;&s;ed error and prejudice? You all can ob&s;erve, that riches alone do not make you happy, and yet give up every thing el&s;e when it &s;tands in competi|tion with riches. Since the world is &s;o bad that religion is left to us &s;illy women, and you men act generally upon principles of profit and plea&s;ure, I will talk to you without argu|ing from any thing but what may be mo&s;t to your advantage, as a man of the world. And I will lay before you the &s;tate of the ca&s;e;&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ing that you had it in your power to make me your mi&s;tre&s;s or your wife, and hope to convince you that the latter is more for your intere&s;t, and will contribute more to your plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>We will &s;uppo&s;e then the &s;cene was laid, and you were now in expectation of the ap|proaching evening wherein I was to meet you, and be carried to what convenient corner of the town you thought fit, to con&s;ummate all which your want on imagination has promi&s;ed you in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one who is in the bloom of youth, and in the reputation of innocence: you would &s;oon have enough of me, as I am &s;prightly, young, gay an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">airy. When fancy is &s;ated, and finds all the promi&s;es it made it&s;elf fal&s;e, where is now the innocence which charmed you? The fir&s;t hour you are alone
<PB N="70" REF="032500_0070_0FF2FB93EB524178">
you will find that the plea&s;ure of a debauchee is only that of a de&s;troyer? he bla&s;ts all the fruit he ta&s;tes; and where the brute has been devouring, there is nothing left worthy the reli&s;h of man.

<P>On the other hand, if you can be &s;o good and generous as to make me your wife, you may promi&s;e your&s;elf all the obedience and tender<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s with which gratitude can in&s;pire a virtuous woman. Whatever gratifications you may promi&s;e your&s;elf from an agreeable per&s;on, whatever compliances from an ea&s;y temper, whatever con&s;olations from a &s;incere friend&s;hip, you may expect as the due of your genero&s;ity. What at pre&s;ent in your ill view you promi&s;e your&s;elf from me, will be follow|ed by di&s;ta&s;te and &s;atiety; but the tran&s;ports of a virtuous love are the lea&s;t part of its happi|ne&s;s.

The raptures of innocent pa&s;&s;ion are but like lightning to the day, they rather in|terrupt than advance the plea&s;ure of it. How happy then is that life to be, where the high|e&s;t plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e are but the lowe&s;t parts of its felicity.</P>
<P>"Now am I to repeat to you the unnatural reque&s;t of taking me in direct terms. I know there &s;tands between me and that happine&s;s, the haughty daughter of a man who can give you &s;uitably to your fortune. But if you weigh the attendance and behavior of her who comes to you in partner&s;hip of your fortune, and expect an equivalent, with that of her who enters your hou&s;e as honoured and obli|ged by that permi&s;&s;ion, whom of the two will you choo&s;e? You, perhaps, will think fit to &s;pend a day abroad in the common entertain|ments of men of &s;en&s;e and fortune, &s;he will think her&s;elf ill u&s;ed in that ab&s;en&s;e, and contrive at home an expence proportioned to the appear|ance which you make in the world. She is in all things to have a regard to the fortune which &s;he brought you, I to the fortune to which you introduced me. The commerce between you two will eternally have the air of a bargain, between us of a friend&s;hip; joy will ever enter into the room with you, and kind wi&s;hes attend my benefactor when he leaves it. A&s;k your&s;elf, how would you be plea&s;ed to enjoy for ever the plea&s;ure of having laid an immediate obligation on a greatful mind?&mdash;

Such will be your ca&s;e with me. In the oth|er marriage you will live in a con&s;tant compar|i&s;on of benefits, and never know the happi|ne&s;s of confering or receiving any.</P>
<P>"It may be you will, after all, act rather in the prudential way, according to the &s;en&s;e of the ordinary world.

<HEAD>FRATERNAL AFFECTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, the Portuge&s;e carracks &s;ailed from Li&s;bon to Goa, a very great, rich, and flouri&s;hing colo|ny of that nation in the Ea&s;t-Indies. There
<PB N="77" REF="032500_0077_0FF2FBA63903B7E8">
was no le&s;s than twelve hundred &s;ouls, marin|ers, pa&s;&s;engers, prie&s;ts, and friars, on board one of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els. The beginning of their voyage was pro&s;perous; they had doubled the &s;outhern extremity of the great continent of Africa, called the cape of Good Hope, and were &s;teering their cour&s;e northea&s;t, to the great continent of India, when &s;ome gentle|men on board, who, having &s;tudied geography and navigation, (arts which reflect honor on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors) found in the latitude in which they were then &s;ailing a large ridge of rocks laid down in the &s;ea-charts. They no &s;ooner made this di&s;covery, than they acquainted the captain of the &s;hip with the affair, de&s;iring him to communicate the &s;ame to the pilot;&mdash;which reque&s;t he immediately granted, re|comended him to lie by in the night, and &s;lack|en &s;ail by day, until they &s;hould be pa&s;t the danger. It is a cu&s;tom always among the por|tugue&s;e ab&s;olutely to commit the failing part, or the navigation of the ve&s;&s;el to the pilot, who is an&s;werable with his head for the &s;afe con|duct or carriage of the king's &s;hips, or tho&s;e belonging to private traders; and he is un|der no manner of direction from the captain, who commands in every other re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The pilot being one of tho&s;e &s;elf-&s;ufficient men who think every hint given them from others in the way of their profe&s;&s;ion deroga|tory from their under&s;tandings, took it as an affront to be taught his art, and in&s;tead of
<PB N="78" REF="032500_0078_0FF2FBA8E5E67BF0">
complying with the captain's reque&s;t, actaul|ly crowded more &s;ail than the ve&s;&s;el had car|ried before. They had not &s;ailed many hours, but ju&s;t about the dawn of day, a terrible di&s;|a&s;ter befel them, which would have been pre|vented if they had lain by. The &s;hip &s;truck upon a rock. I leave to the reader's imagin|ation, what a &s;cene of horror this dreadful acci|dent mu&s;t occa&s;ion among twelve hundred per|&s;ons, all in the &s;ame inevitable danger; behold|ing with fearful a&s;toni&s;hment, that in&s;tantane|ous death which now &s;tared them in the face!</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s, the captain ordered the pin|nace to be launched, into which having to&s;&s;|ed a &s;mall quantity of bi&s;cuit and &s;ome boxes of marmalade, he jumped in him&s;elf with nine|teen others, who with their &s;words, prevented the coming in of any more, le&s;t the boat &s;hould &s;ink. In this condition they put off into the great Indian ocean, without a compa&s;s to &s;teer by, or fre&s;h water but what might happen to fall from the heavens, who&s;e mercy alone could deliver them. After they had rowed to and fro four days in this mi&s;erable condi|tion, the captain, who had been for &s;ome time very &s;ick and weak, died; this added, if po&s;&s;i|ble, to their mi&s;ery, for as they now fell into confu&s;ion, every one would govern, and none would obey. This obliged them to elect one of their own company to command them, who&s;e orders they implicitly agreed to follow. This per&s;on propo&s;ed to the company to draw
<PB N="79" REF="032500_0079_0FF2FBAC75E84B00">
lots, and ca&s;t every fourth man over-board; as their &s;mall &s;tock of provi&s;ions was &s;o far &s;pent, as not to be able at a very &s;hort allow|ance to &s;u&s;tain life above three days longer.&mdash;They were now nineteen per&s;ons in all: in this number were a friar and a carpenter, both of whom they would exempt, as the one was u&s;eful to ab&s;olve and comfort them in their la&s;t extremity, and the other to repair the pin|nace in ca&s;e of a leak or other accident. The &s;ame compliment they paid to their new cap|tain, he being the odd man, and his life of much con&s;equence. He refu&s;ed their indul|gence a great while; but at la&s;t they obliged him to acquie&s;ce, &s;o that there were four to die out of the &s;ixteen remaining per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The three fir&s;t, after having confe&s;&s;ed and received ab&s;olution, &s;ubmitted to their fate.&mdash;The fourth, whom fortune condemned, was a Portuge&s;e gentleman that had a younger bro|ther in the boat, who &s;eeing him about to be thrown over-board, mo&s;t tenderly embraced him, and with tears in his eyes be&s;ought him to let him die in his room, enforcing his arguments by telling him that he was a married man, and had a wife and children at Goa, be&s;ides the care of three &s;i&s;ters, who ab&s;olutely depended upon him; that as for him&s;elf, he was &s;ingle, and his life of no great importance: he there|fore conjured him to &s;uffer him to &s;upply his place. The elder brother, a&s;toni&s;hed and melt|ing with this genero&s;ity, replied, that &s;ince
<PB N="80" REF="032500_0080_0FF2FBAE330182A8">
the divine Providence had appointed him to &s;uffer, it would be wicked and unju&s;t to permit any other to die for him, e&s;pecially a brother, to whom he was &s;o infinitely obliged. The younger, per&s;i&s;ting in his purpo&s;e, would take no denial: but throwing him&s;elf on his knees, held his brother &s;o fa&s;t, that the company could not di&s;engage them. Thus they di&s;puted for a while, the elder brother bidding him be a father to his children, and recommended his wife to his protection, and as he would inherit his e&s;tate, to take care of their common &s;i&s;|ters; but all he could &s;ay could not make the young man de&s;i&s;t. This was a &s;cene of tender|ne&s;s that mu&s;t fill every brea&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of generous impre&s;&s;ions with pity. At la&s;t the con&s;tancy of the elder yielded to the piety of the other. He acquie&s;ced, and &s;uffered the gallant youth to &s;upply his place, who being ca&s;t into the &s;ea, and a good &s;wimmer, &s;oon got to the &s;tern of the pinnace, and laid hold of the rudder with his right hand, which being perceived by one of the &s;ailors, he cut off the hand with his &s;word; then dropping into the &s;ea, he pre&s;ently caught hold again with his left, which received the &s;ame fate by a &s;econd blow; thus di&s;membered of both hands, he made a &s;hift notwith&s;tanding to keep him&s;elf above water with his &s;eer and two &s;tumps, which he held bleeding upwards.</P>
<P>This moving &s;pectacle &s;o rai&s;ed the pity of the whole company, that they cried out, He i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

but one man, let us endeavour to &s;ave his life; and he was accordingly taken into the boat, where he had his hands bound up as well as the place and circum&s;tances could permit.&mdash;They rowed all that night and the next morn|ing: when the &s;un aro&s;e, as if heaven would reward the gallantry and piety of this young man, they de&s;cried land, which proved to be the mountains Mozambique, in Africa, nor far from a Portugue&s;e colony. Thither they all &s;afe arrived, where they remained until the next &s;hip for Li&s;bon pa&s;&s;ed by and carried them to Goa.</P>
<P>At that city, Lin&s;choton, a writer of good credit and e&s;teem, a&s;&s;ures us, that he him&s;elf &s;aw them land, &s;upped with the two brothers that very night, beheld the younger with his &s;tumps, and had the &s;tory from both their mouths as well as from the re&s;t of the compa|ny.</P>

<P>CHIOMARA, the wife of Ortiagon, a Gan|li&s;h prince, was equally admirable for her beau|ty and cha&s;tity. During the war between the Romans and the Gauls, A.

Chiomary, among many other ladies, was taken pri&s;oner, and committed to the care of a cen|turion, no le&s;s pa&s;&s;ionate for money than wo|men. He, at fir&s;t, tried to gain her con&s;ent to his in infamous de&s;ires; but not being able to

prevail upon her, and &s;ubvert her con&s;tancy, he thought he might employ force with a wo|man who misfortune had reduced to &s;lave|ry. Afterwards, to make her amends for that treatment, he offered to re&s;tore her liberty; but not without ran&s;om. He agreed with her for a certain &s;um, and to conceal this de&s;ign from the Romans, he permited her to &s;end any one of the pri&s;oners &s;he &s;hould choo&s;e to her relations, and a&s;&s;igned a place near the riv|er where the lady &s;hould be exchanged for gold. By accident there was one of her own &s;laves among the pri&s;oners. Upon him &s;he fix|ed: and the centurion &s;oon after carried her beyond the advanced po&s;ts, under cover of a dark night. The next evening two of the relations of the prince&s;s came to the place ap|pointed, whither the centurion al&s;o carried his captive. When they delivered him the Attic talent they had brought, which was the &s;um they had agreed on, the lady, in her own language, ordered tho&s;e who came to receive her to draw their &s;words and kill the centurion, who was then amu&s;ing him&s;elf with weighing the gold. Then, charmed with having revenged the in|jury done her cha&s;tity, &s;he took the head of the officer, which &s;he had cut off with her own hands and hiding it under her robe, went to her hu&s;band Ortiagon, who had returned home after the defeat of his troops.

<P>VULGAR errors maintain their ground, becau&s;e men have not &s;pirit enough to detect them.

<P>Three &s;harpers, having found means to be introduced to a king, told him that they could weave a brocade of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, and of &s;o rare a property, that it would be invi&s;ible to any per&s;on who was either ba&s;e born, di&s;honored by his wife, or had been guilty of any villainy. The king de&s;irous to

po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o great a rarity, gave them a kind re|ception, and allotted them a palace to carry on the manufacture. He furni&s;hed them with mo|ney, gold, &s;ilver, &s;ilk and all other materials. They fixed up their looms, and reported that they were all day employed upon the web. Af|ter &s;ome time, one of them waited upon the king, and acquainted him that the work was begun, and that the brocade would be the mo&s;t beautiful in the world, as his maje&s;ty might be convinced, if he would conde&s;cend to come and &s;ee it alone. The king, to prove the re|ality of their pretentio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, in&s;tead of going him|&s;elf, &s;ent his chamberlain, but without drop|ping any hint of the danger of an impo&s;ition. The chamberlain went: but when the weavers told him the property of the brocade, he had not courage enough to &s;ay that he did not &s;ee it, but told the king that the work went on, and that the piece would be of unparalleled beauty. The king &s;ent another nobleman, who, from the &s;ame motive, made the &s;ame report. After that he &s;ent many others, who all declared they had &s;een the piece. At length the king went him&s;elf, and upon entrance ob|&s;erved that their whole conver&s;ation turned upon the &s;ucce&s;s of their work; one &s;aying, "here is a noble foliage!" another, "what a grand de&s;ign!" a third, "how beautiful is this colour!" But as he &s;aw nothing all this time except the loom, and as he could not &s;u&s;|pect the report which had been brought him

by &s;o many courtiers without any variation, he was &s;truck to the heart, and began to doubt of the legitimacy of his own birth. However, he thought it mo&s;t prudent to expre&s;s him&s;elf highly plea&s;ed with the goodne&s;s and beauty of this ma&s;ter piece of art. At the end of three days, he &s;ent of his &s;teward, who, that he might not lo&s;e his honor, prai&s;ed the work even more extravagantly than the king had done.&mdash;This redoubled the king's vexation; and he and all the courtiers remained in the utmo&s;t doubt and perplexity; no one daring to confe&s;s that this famous piece was a non entity to him.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate the affair continued, till upon occa&s;ion of a great fe&s;tival, &s;ome courtiers pre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty to have robes made of this &s;ilk in honor of the day. When the weavers came to the pre&s;ence chamber, and were ac|quainted with the king's purpo&s;e, they in&s;i&s;ted that none could make up the brocade &s;o well as them&s;elves, pretended that they had bro't it with them curiou&s;ly wrapped up, and bu&s;ied them&s;elve as if they were unfolding it.

On the fe&s;tival day they returned, pretended they brought the robe, made as if they were trying it on, and at length told his maje&s;ty that it fitted him, and adorned him beyond imagination. The king, credulous and confounded, walked down &s;tairs,

At length a Moor, who belonged to the king's &s;tables, could not help crying out, "The king is in his &s;hirt, the king is naked." The ice was now broke.

Among her numerous train of admirers, none &s;eemed &s;o agreeable and de&s;erving her e&s;teem as the young lord Amiable, who, incapable of any ba&s;e de&s;igns, gave &s;uch a&s;&s;urances of his love, that Pruden|tia ea&s;ily &s;urrendered her heart.

As this was a match not maid up by treaty, but by free choice and inclination, they did not fall into that modi&s;h coldne&s;s and complai&s;ant indifference people of fa&s;hion are &s;oon apt to do. My lord was a man of u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s and affability of tem|per, which, when joined to that of Prudentia's, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make him happy with his wife; yet his ea&s;ine&s;s, and credulity of the genero&s;i|ty of &s;ome of his companions had like to have le&s;&s;ened his dome&s;tic felicity, but the di&s;cretion of Prudentia prevented it.

With drinking, his health &s;oon began to be impaired; with lo&s;&s;|es his temper was ruffled; with wenching, that fondne&s;s and cordial love he u&s;ed to &s;hew to his lady, began to cea&s;e. Prudentia was not a little concerned at this conduct: &s;he too well knew all his vices; yet di&s;creetly thought that any violent oppo&s;ition would but heighten the mi&s;chief: &s;he took care to make home as ea&s;y to him as po&s;&s;ible: &s;tudious of obliging, &s;he never di&s;gu&s;ted him by har&s;h reproaches and &s;atirical reflections on his conduct; neith|er, though careful to plea&s;e him, did &s;he run into an extreme of fondne&s;s; &s;he was not fond when &s;he thought it would be di&s;agreeable; for &s;he knew that a wife without di&s;cretion my make the tendere&s;t endearments the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome.

You have beauty enough to plea&s;e a hu&s;band, have there|fore an equal de&s;ire to do it: be the more &s;tudious of his humour as he is more faulty in his conduct, and let your affability &s;hew his inju&s;tice in wronging you: the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es the men vi&s;it exert all their little arts to plea&s;e them, for gain only, without honor, without con&s;cience, and without love: why then &s;hould not a virtuous woman &s;hew as great a de&s;ire to plea&s;e her hu&s;band as as the&s;e artful jilts do to plea&s;e a gallant."</P>

Mrs. Thoughtle&s;s was plea&s;ed with her ad|vice: my lord approved of it and was &s;ecretly touched to the &s;oul for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions a|gain&s;t &s;o incomparable a wife, who had acted what &s;he &s;poke, and had more per&s;onal charms than the woman his fal&s;e friend had introdu|ced him to. When he had recollected him|&s;elf, he propo&s;ed that his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould bring her hu&s;band to dinner the next day; and that his lady &s;hould repeat what &s;he had alrea|dy &s;aid, and he was a&s;&s;ured that it would have and excellent effect. It was agreed on; but with this di&s;creet caution of Lady Amiable, that her di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould be directed to my lord, to take off any &s;u&s;picion that it was in|tended for Mr. Thoughtle&s;s. The next day they met, and my Lord Amiable &s;aw him&s;elf prudently attacked by his lady for his real faults, while &s;he &s;eemed only to take them for imaginary ones. To what &s;he had &s;aid before, &s;he added &s;ome reflections on the ill choice men of quality make of their acquaintance, a|mong whom are the merry, laughing buffoons, who lead them into all the vices of the age, under the fal&s;e preteuce of friend&s;hip; at which words, looked at her lord in the mo&s;t tender manner, &s;he concluded, "The&s;e, my lord, are wretched friends, who lead you into &s;uch evil; on the contrary, the friend&s;hip between man and wife is cemented by virtue, love, and intere&s;t, and cannot be di&s;&s;olved without de&s;troying the happine&s;s of both. Let

At the&s;e la&s;t words, my lord, overcome with the gentle reproach, flung him&s;elf about her neck, and amid&s;t a thou&s;and ki&s;&s;es, prom|i&s;ed mutual love. The&s;e tran&s;ports were fol|lowed by the like in my lady's brother and wife, who owned him&s;elf a convert to virtue and matrimonial affection.</P>

<P>SIR William A&s;kew, of Kel&s;ay, in Lincoln|&s;hire, was ble&s;&s;ed with &s;everal daughters. His &s;econd, name Anne, had received a genteel education; which, with an agreeable per&s;on, and good under&s;tanding, rendered her a very proper per&s;on to be at the head of a family.&mdash;Her father, regardle&s;s of his daughter's incli|nation
<PB N="92" REF="032500_0092_0FF2FBD0E83C0C80">
and happine&s;s, obliged her to marry a gentleman who had nothing to recommend him but his fortune, and who was a mo&s;t big|oted papi&s;t. No &s;ooner was he convinced of his wife's regard for the doctrines of the re|formation from popery, than, by the in&s;tiga|tion of the prie&s;ts, he violently drove her from his hou&s;e, though &s;he had borne him two chil|dren, and her conduct was unexceptionable.&mdash;Abandoned by her hu&s;band, &s;he came up to London, in order to procure a divorce, and to make her&s;elf known to that part of the court who either profe&s;&s;ed, or were favourers of prote&s;tanti&s;m: but, as Henry VIII, with con|&s;ent of parliament, had ju&s;t enacted the law of the &s;ix articles, commonly called the bloody &s;tatute, &s;he was cruelly betrayed by her own hu&s;band; and upon his information, taken into cu&s;tody, and examined concerning her faith. The act above mentioned denounced death to all tho&s;e who &s;hould deny the doct|rine of <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tantiation;</HI> or, that the bread and wine made u&s;e of in the &s;acrament was not converted, after con&s;ecration, into the <HI>real</HI> bo|dy and blood of Chri&s;t; or maintain the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of receiving the &s;acrament in both kinds; or affirm, that it was lawful for prie&s;ts to mar|ry; that the vows of celibacy might be bro|ken; that private ma&s;&s;es were of no avail;&mdash;that auricular confe&s;&s;ion to a prie&s;t was not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. Upon the&s;e articles, &s;he was examined by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> a prie&s;t, the

lord-mayor of London, and the bi&s;hop's chan|cellor; and to all their queries gave proper and pertinent an&s;wers; but not being &s;uch as they approved, &s;he was &s;ent back to pri&s;on; where &s;he remained eleven days to ruminate alone on her alarming &s;ituation, and was deni|ed the &s;mall con&s;olation of a friendly vi&s;it.&mdash;The king's council being at Greenwich &s;he was once more examined by chancellor Wrio|the&s;ley, Gardiner, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, Dr. Cox, and Dr. Robin&s;on; but not being able to convince her of her &s;uppo&s;ed errors, &s;he was &s;ent to the Tower. It was &s;trongly &s;u&s;|pected, that Mrs. A&s;kew was favoured by &s;ome ladies of high rank; and that &s;he carried on a religious corre&s;pondence with the queen.&mdash;So that the chancellor Wriothe&s;ley, hoping that he might di&s;cover &s;omething that would afford matter of impeachment again&s;t that prince&s;s, the earl of Hertford, or his counte&s;s, who all favoured the reformation, ordered her to be put to the rack: but her fortitude in &s;uffering, and her re&s;olution not to betray her friends, was proof again&s;t that diabolical inven|tion. Not a groan, not a word could be ex|torted from her. The chancellor, provoked with what he called her ob&s;tanacy, augment|ed her tortures with his own hands, and with unheard of violence: her courage and con|&s;tancy were invincible; and the&s;e barbarians gained nothing by their cruelti&eacute;s, but ever|la&s;ting di&s;grace and infamy. As &s;oon as &s;he

was taken from the rack &s;he fainted away;&mdash;but being recovered, &s;he was condemned, to, the flames. Her bones were di&s;located in &s;uch a manner, that they were forced to carry her in a chair to the place of execution. While &s;he was at the &s;take, letters were brought her from the lord chancellor, offering her the king's pardon if &s;he would recant. But &s;he refu&s;ed to look at them; telling the me&s;&s;enger, that "&s;he came not thither to deny her lord and ma&s;ter." The &s;ame letters were al&s;o tendered to three other per&s;ons, condemned to the &s;ame fate; and who, animated by her example, refu&s;ed to accept them. Whereupon the lord mayor commanded the fire to be kindled;&mdash;and, with &s;avage ignorance, cried out <HI>Fiat ju&s;|titia,</HI> Let gu&s;tice take its cour&s;e. The faggots being lighted, &s;he commended her &s;oul, with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure, into the hands of her Maker; and, like the great founder of the re|ligion &s;he profe&s;&s;ed expired, <HI>praying for her murderers,</HI> July 16, 1546, about the 25th year of her age.</P>

<P>ATHELBERT, the la&s;t king of the Ea&s;t|Angels, was of a very amiable temper, a fine per&s;on and great virtues. The goodne&s;s of his nature, and the humility of his mind, the regard he &s;hewed to religion in his actions, and ju&s;tice in his admini&s;tration, rendered him the delight of his people, who wanted noth|ing

to complete their happine&s;s but an heir to &s;ucceed to the crown in ca&s;e of his decea&s;e.&mdash;He was young; had been bred to letters, and being fond of books, had not been &s;u&s;ceptible of any impre&s;&s;ion from beauty; perhaps, the reigning pa&s;&s;ion of the age, inclining to celib|acy, might have contributed, in &s;ome mea&s;|ure to his in&s;en&s;ibility. The univer&s;al de&s;ire and common good of his people, the di&s;traction and convul&s;ions the kingdom would be expo&s;|ed to for want of an heir, were the topics u&s;ed by the nobility and bi&s;hops, which induced him to call a council to con&s;ider of the mat|ter. It being their unanimous opinion that it would be be&s;t for him to marry; Athelrida, the daughter of O&s;&s;a, king of Mercia, a prin|ce&s;s of great beauty and merit, was immediate|ly fixed on as a &s;uitable match. The young king, not long after &s;et out with a &s;plendid re|tinue, accompanied by count O&s;wald, the chief of his council, and the per&s;on who had fir&s;t named the lady to the king. Being arriv|ed on the borders of the Mercian territories, they waited for a &s;afe-conduct, and the con|&s;ent of the lady's father, who was then keep|ing his court at Hertford. On the recep|tion of this me&s;&s;age a council was held to con|&s;ider on the manner in which Athelbert &s;hould be treated. The courtiers, who ea&s;ily per|ceived the intentions of their monarch, and thinking this a fine opportunity to annex the hingdom of Ea&s;t-Angles to that of Mercia,
<PB N="69" REF="032500_0096_0FF2FBDC651CA028">
determined to murder Athelbert and &s;eize his dominions. The more effectually to ac|compli&s;h this villainous de&s;ign, he was invited with the greate&s;t &s;hew of friend&s;hip to a con|ference with O&s;&s;a, under the pretence of &s;et|tling the preliminaries of his marriage; and going thither without any attendants, was &s;eiz|ed in his way by Guimbert, and privately be|headed. The young prince&s;s, &s;hocked at her father's perfidious cruelty, &s;ent the earlie&s;t no|tice of this cata&s;trophe to the nobility who waited for the return of the king. Unable to revenge his death, and fearful of the like fate, they immediately mounted their hor&s;es, and made the be&s;t way to their own country. Athel|bert's corp&s;e and head were buried at fir&s;t by Offa's order in an ob&s;cure place on the banks of the Lugge, but were afterwards removed to Fernley, &s;ince called Hertford, the cathe|dral of which city is dedicited to his honor.</P>
