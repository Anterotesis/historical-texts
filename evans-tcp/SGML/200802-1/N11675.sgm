<Q><HI>Be &s;trong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the King of A&s;&s;yria, nor for all the multitude that is with him. With him is an arm of fle&s;h, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles.</HI></Q>

<P>THERE is nothing can afford &s;uch &s;olid and ration|al comfort in any undertaking, as a firm and un|&s;haken confidence that the Lord Jehovah is on our &s;ide, and the cau&s;e we engage in, is the cau&s;e of God. As it lays the foundation of true, chri&s;tian courage, &s;o it ought to be the rule by which to walk and conduct our&s;elves. If we are zealou&s;ly affected, it &s;hould always be in a good cau&s;e, and &s;uch as the God of Heaven will approve of. Unle&s;s we &s;et out with this view, we have rea&s;on to expect nothing but di&s;appointment in the i&s;&s;ue. It mu&s;t be ac|knowledged by all, who profe&s;s to believe the being and perfections of a God, that there is not only a general, but particular providence, ordering and directing the affairs of our world, &s;o as to &s;ub&s;erve the wi&s;e ends of the divine go|vernment. This being the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be a matter of the la&s;t importance to us, whether in a &s;ingle or &s;ocial capacity, that we have God our almighty friend and protector. This belief is undoubtedly implied in the parti|cular application that has been made, to have a &s;ermon preached, &s;uited to the pre&s;ent times and adapted in a pe|culiar manner to the circum&s;tance of &s;uch pre&s;ent, as are ready to march into the field, gallantly to expo&s;e their lives in defence of our mo&s;t invaluable rights and privileges. Now if God be for us, who may or can be again&s;t us? But if God be again&s;t us, what power can &s;ucce&s;sfully engage in our defence?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="014758_0003_0F94DD8DC6E03930">
IN our context we have an account of Sennacherib's de|&s;cent upon Hezekiah's kingdom, together with the &s;pecial care Hezekiah took to put him&s;elf in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible po&s;ture of defence. The means is ours, the &s;ucce&s;s de|pends upon God. Sennacherib was then the &s;courge of that part of the world, as Nebuchadnezzar was afterwards. God often rai&s;es up &s;uch in&s;truments for the purpo&s;e of execut|ing his will, and bringing about &s;ome important revolu|tions. They are u&s;ed as the rods of his anger, and when his work is done he ca&s;ts them into the fire. Every &s;tep is taken by Hezekiah to check Sennacherib's march through his dominions. If we tru&s;t God with our &s;afety it mu&s;t be in the u&s;e of proper means, otherwi&s;e we tempt, not tru&s;t him.</P>
<P>IN the 6th ver&s;e the good King gathers the people to|gether and &s;peaks comfortably unto them. This was infinitely better calculated to in&s;pire both officers and &s;ol|diers with fre&s;h courage to go into the field, than horrid oaths and imprecations. It is mo&s;t certainly a matter of &s;upreme con&s;equence that &s;uch as have the principal direc|tion of an army be men of God, that they may in&s;pire their &s;oldiery with true chri&s;tian courage.</P>
<P>BE &s;trong, &amp;c. q. d. Do not ba&s;ely &s;hrink back in an hour of danger, but re&s;olve to hold it out to the la&s;t man. Let the &s;oldiers quit them&s;elves like men, make good their parts, &s;tand to their arms, and di&s;play their valour equal to the goodne&s;s of the cau&s;e. Like a General who di&s;plays his banners under the Lord of Ho&s;ts, he encourages them with the mo&s;t animating con&s;iderations, that however numerous and formidable the army was that came again&s;t them, yet theirs exceeded. God, &s;ays he, is with us, and that is more than all the combined forces of the enemy. At be&s;t the arm of fle&s;h is all that they can boa&s;t of, but with us is an irre|&s;i&s;table and omnipotent arm. We have a God in covenant, not only to help us, but to go before and fight our battles.</P>
<P>OBSERVATION. There is nothing tends &s;o effectually to in&s;pire with true courage as a lively impre&s;&s;ion of the pre|&s;ence and interpo&s;ition of God.</P>
<P>IN the farther pro&s;ecution of the &s;ubject, I de&s;ign, thro' divine aid, the following method.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="014758_0003_0F94DD8DC6E03930">
1&s;t. TO &s;hew wherein true Fortitude con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P N="2">2d. BY what method we are to judge of God's being on our &s;ide, to fight our battles.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THE grounds of confidence ari&s;ing therefrom.</P>
<P>I. I am to &s;hew you wherein true Fortitude con&s;i&s;ts.&mdash;In general it con&s;i&s;ts in a temper of mind di&s;po&s;ing per&s;ons to perform brave and noble actions, without being daunted at the appearance of dangers or difficulties in the way. With much propriety therefore is this temper recommend|ed to &s;uch as are engaged in the military life, as they mu&s;t endure hardne&s;s, and lay their accounts to meet with many hard&s;hips in the di&s;charge of their important tru&s;t. True Fortitude is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to compleat a good &s;ol|dier. A poor pu&s;illanimous &s;oul is unfit for real &s;ervice, and &s;hrinks back in an hour of danger, when duty urges to action. The Heathen Morali&s;ts reckoned courage in war to be the highe&s;t di&s;play thereof, and that the &s;oldier had the be&s;t opportunity to di&s;play his courage, as life, the deare&s;t thing in the world, was ri&s;qued in war. There is natural Fortitude or Stoutne&s;s, a large &s;hare of which the ancient Romans po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which, however &s;erviceable for the &s;oldier, yet is e&s;&s;entially different from, and va&s;tly in|ferior to, the Fortitude I am explaining. Many mi&s;take its true nature, and at be&s;t give us but a very feeble and imperfect notion thereof. There is no more illu&s;trious di&s;play of real Fortitude than to encounter the vicious pre|judices of the age we live in; to row again&s;t the current of corrupt cu&s;toms, to be &s;ingly &s;ober amid&s;t tho&s;e who mock at all goodne&s;s, virtue and piety; to reject the en|ticements of kind but wicked companions; and e&s;pecially to put to the torture and re&s;olutely crucify one's own car|nal inclinations: This requires a face of flint and an heart of &s;teel, the &s;pirit and courage of an hero, and the &s;trength of a giant. e&s;pecially by &s;uch as from the nature of their calling, plunge into a &s;ea of temptation, and are perpetu|ally dunned with the allurements of en&s;naring companions. This, Gentlemen, as it is at the foundation of true Forti|tude, &s;o it is the be&s;t armour you can carry with you into the field. "Therefore quit your&s;elves like men, be &s;trong,
<PB N="6" REF="014758_0004_0F94DD8E8DF10010">
take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to &s;tand again&s;t all the wiles of the Devil." Many whil&s;t they have laid the world in blood and a&s;hes, have had Victory chained to their chariot wheels wherever they turned, have been mean and ba&s;e cowards, &s;ubmitted to the tyranny of every unruly lu&s;t and appetite. The vic|tory over carnal &s;elf, is more than to &s;et flames to whole rowns, and level the proude&s;t walls.</P>
<P>BUT to be particular&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. TRUE courage does not con&s;i&s;t in in&s;en&s;ibility of danger, but nobly ri&s;ing above it in our minds. There can be no di&s;play of courage, however great the danger, if per&s;ons are entirely in&s;en&s;ible thereof. In vain may the per&s;on a&s;leep upon a top-ma&s;t in time of a &s;torm, al|ledge that it was an in&s;tance of courage; or the drunkard &s;tanding upon the brink of an awful precipice. Neither will it be characteri&s;tic of true courage for per&s;ons to plunge into thicke&s;t dangers, without a proper &s;en&s;e there|of, and a mind ready prepared to meet every event. The more quick our &s;en&s;e of danger, the more true heroi&s;m in engaging therein, as it manife&s;ts a clear &s;en&s;e of duty and our fixed re&s;olution to per&s;evere.</P>
<P N="2">2d. NEITHER does true Fortitude con&s;i&s;t in bani&s;hing all fear. The fear of God is not only con&s;i&s;tent with, but at the very foundation of true courage. There is no &s;uch hero as the chri&s;tian hero, nor is any thing of equal effica|cy to encourage us to meet death, as the fear of God up|on our hearts. I fear many of our gentlemen officers and &s;oldiers are accu&s;tomed to e&s;teem it an in&s;tance of cowardice to fear and &s;erve God, and therefore ca&s;t off all fear and re&s;train prayer before him. This is not courage but teme|rity or ra&s;hne&s;s. "What, not fear him who can kill both &s;oul and body and ca&s;t them into hell for ever?" Not to fear God is to be a &s;ervant of &s;in and &s;lave to every un|ruly lu&s;t. Thus we often &s;ee that &s;ober and di&s;creet youths, as &s;oon as they enter the army grow debauched, learn to profane God's holy name, as though cur&s;ing and &s;wearing were vices licen&s;ed by the God of Heaven. I hope better things of you, Gentlemen, yet as a faithful friend I mu&s;t warn you.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="014758_0004_0F94DD8E8DF10010">
3. NEITHER does it con&s;i&s;t in expo&s;ing our&s;elves to un|nece&s;&s;ary danger. Our courage ought to be exerci&s;ed in conjunction with chri&s;tian prudence, &s;o as not to ru&s;h into danger unle&s;s a &s;en&s;e of duty calls. To plunge our|&s;elves into the mo&s;t imminent danger where the object to be obtained is very incon&s;iderable, and the pro&s;pect of ob|taining even that little, doubtful, would be injudicious and ra&s;h. Per&s;ons may throw away their lives under the mi&s;taken notion of fortitude, to perpetuate their names, and gain immortal renown. When the call is clear, and the object to be obtained, glorious, no danger &s;hould be avoided&mdash;the greate&s;t difficulties &s;ubmitted to.</P>
<P N="4">4. TRUE courage then con&s;i&s;ts in a free and chearful di&s;po&s;ition to encounter the greate&s;t dangers, when there is an evident call in the providence of God. This ought to be the grand object of our attention, and at the foun|dation of every hazardous undertaking. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this animates the &s;oul, and makes it ri&s;e above undue fear in the di&s;charge of the mo&s;t arduous duties. There is nothing will make per&s;ons more determined to encoun|ter danger and play the man, than a firm per&s;ua&s;ion that we are on the Lord's &s;ide, and that the cau&s;e we e&s;pou&s;e is the cau&s;e of heaven. In &s;uch circum&s;tances ten men will drive an hundred, and an hundred put a thou&s;and to flight. An army &s;o principled goes into the field re&s;olved upon death or victory.</P>
<P>WITH what a divine enthu&s;ia&s;m were I&s;rael led to en|gage all their enemies, under the animating addre&s;&s;es of their Generals, Mo&s;es and Jo&s;hua? <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxi. 6. "Be &s;trong and of a good courage, fear not nor be afraid of them: For the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor for&s;ake thee." To the &s;ame purpo&s;e, Jo&s;h. i. 9. "Have not I commanded thee? Be &s;trong and of a good courage, be not afraid, neither be thou di&s;mayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee whi|ther &s;oever thou goe&s;t." With &s;uch views, Gentlemen, ought you to go into the field as the mo&s;t &s;ignal proof of your true courage!</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="8" REF="014758_0005_0F94DD8F4A2342B8">
5. TRUE courage manife&s;ts it&s;elf in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing anxious and di&s;tracting fears about what is future. It is enough that he is engaged in the path of duty, and therefore leaves what is future in the hand of God. It is the part of a coward to &s;hrink from pre&s;ent duty for fear of future ills. The coward often fears where there is no real dan|ger, and cries. There is a lion in the &s;treet. He perplex|es him&s;elf with imaginary evils, and repre&s;ents real ones much more frightful than they are in them&s;elves. But the brave &s;oldier does not flinch at the pro&s;pect of future hard&s;hips; he has laid his accounts to endure hardne&s;s as a good &s;oldier, and &s;o &s;tands ready prepared to meet them.</P>
<P N="6">6. TRUE Fortitude will di&s;cover it&s;elf in a vigorous ap|plication to our work, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tated and con&s;tant difficulties and oppo&s;itions that &s;tand in the way. There is a per&s;everance ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and that when we may be foiled once and again. It does not di&s;|pirit the truly magnanimous &s;oldier notwith&s;tanding he may meet with a variety of di&s;couragements and repul&s;es; he per&s;i&s;ts &s;o long as the object appears attainable, and does not &s;ink under a temporary check. He re&s;olves not to quit the field until, under God, he puts the armies of the aliens to flight and comes off a complete conqueror. He is encouraged to pur&s;ue the cau&s;e from a clear con|viction that he fights under Jehovah's banner and that he will be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s at la&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. TRUE Fortitude con&s;i&s;ts in an uniform &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of conduct amid&s;t all the trials and dangers we meet with. There can be no di&s;play of courage when danger is not near; many talk big when dangers are at a di&s;tance, but let them be called forth to meet them, they will &s;link into a corner and ba&s;ely betray the cau&s;e, when the greate&s;t need to &s;tand forth. But cool courage and real fortitude encrea&s;es and that in proportion to the danger. He quits not his po&s;t, flinches not his ground, nor turns his back upon the oppo&s;ing enemy. Though he might have had his fears before the &s;cene of action; though he might not have had &s;o much fal&s;e confidence as many others; though he might meet danger with a trembling hand, yet if he
<PB N="9" REF="014758_0005_0F94DD8F4A2342B8">
&s;tands his ground in the heat of battle, he gives the mo&s;t unequivocal proof of his real Fortitude. It has often been remarked of &s;ome of the brave&s;t &s;oldiers, that they have come into the field with a trembling hand, and yet have performed wonders. No puni&s;hment can be too great for the ba&s;e coward who either de&s;erts or meanly turns his back in the hour of battle. Upon that moment may hang the fate of an empire; upon that &s;ingle en|gagement the liberties, both civil and religious, of an whole continent. This, my dear Gentlemen, will be your indi&s;pen&s;ible duty if called to action. Remember that the liberties of unborn millions may hang &s;u&s;pended on the fate of a &s;ingle hour&mdash;To de&s;ert the cau&s;e or ba&s;ely betray the important tru&s;t, would leave an indelible blot upon your names and your po&s;terity to the late&s;t ages. Thus I have attempted to open up the nature of true Fortitude, and tru&s;t that God will in&s;pire your &s;ouls with that noble &s;pirit, who are &s;ingling your&s;elves out in de|fence of our invaded rights.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed in the</P>
<P>II HEAD, To &s;hew you by what method we are to judge of God's being on our &s;ide, to fight our battles.</P>
<P>AS a rational conviction of this is at the foundation of true courage, &s;o it becomes all tho&s;e who embark in the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting di&s;pute, narrowly to examine and im|partially to weigh matters, left they might be found to fight again&s;t God. As nothing can animate equal to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a good cau&s;e, &s;o on the other hand no thought can be more &s;inking, no reflection more chilling, than an apprehen&s;ion that we have all the armed ho&s;ts of Heaven to engage with. We are embarking in a mo&s;t important affair, a matter that will draw after it the mo&s;t intere&s;ting con&s;equences both to Great-Britain and the Colonies, in uniting to oppo&s;e the Briti&s;h arms. It high|ly concerns us then &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the matter, &s;o as to proceed upon ju&s;t principles. Would to God that each enli&s;ting in the American &s;ervice, was fir&s;t enli&s;ted under the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o that whether life or death, eternal glory, as the reward, might be their portion? I
<PB N="10" REF="014758_0006_0F94DD9007D6DDD0">
fear many embarking in the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting di&s;pute, do not &s;ufficiently weigh the matter, whether it be a righteous or an unrighteous cau&s;e&mdash;A good cau&s;e may be very improperly engaged in; there is a cur&s;e pronounced upon tho&s;e who do the work of the Lord deceitfully, as well as upon &s;uch who keep back their &s;words from blood. In order then to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in this important point, let me ju&s;t premi&s;e, that we are not to expect any extraordinary revelation from Heaven or miraculous interpo&s;ition in or|der to determine whether God be on our &s;ide; notwith|&s;tanding the great Jehovah was wont in former times to reveal to his &s;ervants the Prophets, the i&s;&s;ue of certain engagements, and that I&s;rael would a&s;&s;uredly prevail; yet as the canon of &s;acred writ is now clo&s;ed, and the &s;pirit of prophecy cea&s;ed, it would be unwarrantable pre&s;umption to expect &s;uch a revelation to mark out the line of our conduct. We are carefully to look into God's word, and mark the &s;teps of divine conduct in order to form a judgment and determine whether we have &s;ufficient rea|&s;on to believe that God will go forth and fight our battles. But to proceed&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t THE cau&s;e mu&s;t be good. Without this we have no rea&s;on to expect that God will intere&s;t him&s;elf in our favour, that he will go forth with our armies and fight our battles. True, God may &s;uffer an unrighteous cau&s;e to pro&s;per for a while, to &s;ub&s;erve the wi&s;e ends of his go|vernment. The rod of the wicked may lay upon the lot of the righteous for a time, but it will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be removed. There is a very material difference between God's permitting an unrighteous cau&s;e for a &s;ea&s;on to pro&s;per, and his protecting and defending a good one. A bad cau&s;e will fail at la&s;t, and God will take glory to him&s;elf in bringing good out of evil. Now, brethren, may we not appeal to God in the pre&s;ent &s;truggle, that our cau&s;e is good? We are not carried through an haughty and wanton &s;pirit to &s;eek for larger dominions, or invade the property of others. We only de&s;ire in a quiet and peaceable manner to enjoy the fruits of our own indu&s;try
<PB N="11" REF="014758_0006_0F94DD9007D6DDD0">
and labor, and have &s;ome little peculium, or &s;tock, we can call our own, without being taxed by a corrupt Par|liament, in which we have no repre&s;entation, nor from our local di&s;tance ever can have. We a&s;ked for no additional privileges, but content with the Charter Rights under which we claimed, felt no di&s;po&s;ition to break off our connection with Britain, if it could with &s;afety be pre&s;erved. We only in&s;i&s;ted upon, as being our indi&s;putable right, the privilege we had time imme|morial enjoyed "of eating every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and to drink every one of his own ci&s;tern." Is it not the &s;imple voice of na|ture that this privilege we &s;hould &s;till enjoy? And is it not agreeable to all our Charters and the very genius of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, that no money &s;hould be filched from us without our own con&s;ent? This is a birthright inherit|ance, and we are loudly called upon by God and Nature to hand it down to po&s;terity. Hence then it appears that the attack is unju&s;tly made upon our property, and we &s;tand acquitted before God and the World to defend it at the expence of blood. As to the antiquated doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive-obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, it has been &s;uffici|ently exploded by many eminent writers, both ancient and modern&mdash;it is &s;uch a wilful attack upon the natural rights of mankind, that it is &s;carcely entitled to a &s;erious refut|ation. We neither de&s;erve the ble&s;&s;ings of civil nor reli|gious Liberty, if we can &s;ee them wre&s;ted from us without a &s;truggle.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps &s;ome might object and &s;ay, it is only a di&s;|pute about civil property; the object is not or &s;ufficient importance to run the ri&s;que of lo&s;s of blood. To this I reply, that time would fail me to enumerate the long and black catalogue of ills that will unavoidably en&s;ue if we tamely give up this one privilege, of being taxed by our own Repre&s;entatives. Our e&s;tates, our all that we have for the &s;upport of our wives and children, mu&s;t be laid at the feet of a bloody Mini&s;try and packed Parliament, for the very purpo&s;e of en&s;laving us more and more, by &s;up|porting
<PB N="12" REF="014758_0007_0F94DD90C69BCD90">
porting over our&s;elves &s;warms of court &s;ycophants and hun|gry leeches, who would never be contented until they had drained the la&s;t penny from our pur&s;es. Add to all this what the Reverend Synod of New-York and Philadel|phia ju&s;tly ob&s;erved in their la&s;t pa&s;toral letter, "that civil and religious Rights are &s;o intimately connected together, that where one is given up the other falls of cour&s;e." Let us for a moment look into the reigns of the Charles's and James's, and we will find that when religious liberties were attacked, the &s;ource of di&s;pute at that time, civil property was rendered precarious and in&s;ecure. Nothing more com|mon than &s;eque&s;trations, confi&s;cations, impri&s;onments, ba|ni&s;hments, and death it&s;elf, in all its hideous forms of terror. Thus it will hold vice ver&s;a&mdash;I am clearly con|vinced, that if we &s;ubmit in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute, liberty of con&s;cience will be next invaded by that lordly Court and corrupt Parliament. There is a &s;trong propen&s;ity in hu|man nature for &s;uch as are in authority to lord it over tho&s;e beneath them, and to have not only the civil but religious privileges of others &s;olely at their di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>THIS renders our di&s;pute with Great-Britain of the ut|mo&s;t importance to all of every denomination; a di&s;pute worth expending millions upon, and hazarding the lives of thou&s;ands, to tran&s;mit fair to our po&s;terity the ble&s;&s;ings of civil and religious liberty. Is it not agreeable to the divine mind that we &s;hould be free, and enjoy the ine&s;ti|mable ble&s;&s;ing of wor&s;hipping God according to the dic|tates of con&s;cience, without the fear of man, which cau&s;|eth a &s;nare? certainly it is. If &s;o, then the cau&s;e is God's, and embarking in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute, we fight the Lord's battles. Will he not then go before and &s;ucceed our arms?</P>
<P N="2">2. IT al&s;o &s;uppo&s;es that we engage in a good cau&s;e from ju&s;t motives and right principles. Without this we have not &s;ufficient ground to expect that God will &s;ucceed our attempts and crown our arms with &s;ucce&s;s, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent. This appears agreeable to the general &s;eries of the divine conduct in former ages. How often did victory decide on the part of I&s;rael's enemies, notwith|&s;tanding

they were heathens? There is an actual cur&s;e pronounced upon &s;uch as do the work of the Lord de|ceitfully. Would to God that in this particular we had &s;till clearer evidence of God's being on our &s;ide, and that per&s;ons in &s;uing for office did not &s;o much &s;tudy their own things! Undoubtedly the prevalence of vice and neglect of God and religion, both in our armies and el&s;ewhere, is matter of deep lamentation, and is a rea&s;on why we may expect that God will &s;uffer us to meet with &s;everal re|pul&s;es in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute, in order that the glory of his power and rich grace may appear the more illu&s;trious in finally crowning us with &s;ucce&s;s. Yet I cannot but ap|prehend that the fears of &s;ome are too much awakened upon this con&s;ideration, and are ready to conclude that from the pre&s;ent decay of religion and growth of impiety, God de&s;igns to give us entirely up and render us a prey to the enemy. I am not of that &s;entiment, as God in his adorable providence &s;uffers a &s;tate, or nation, to arrive at a certain pitch both of greatne&s;s and impiety, before he gives them up to their foes. Now I think it mu&s;t appear evident to every attentive ob&s;erver, that the Colonies are arrived to neither that pitch of greatne&s;s nor yet impiety that length of time may bring about. Wealth is u&s;ually a fore-runner of vice, and tho&s;e cities which have been the marts of trade, have generally imported foreign fa&s;hions and &s;inful cu&s;toms. I tru&s;t that the pre&s;ent &s;truggle will &s;erve to humble the pride of our Colonies, and that who|ever lives will &s;ee glorious days in America con&s;equent up|on this black cloud that now hangs over us. Be&s;ides, there are &s;till &s;ome favorable &s;ymptoms that God is with us and that he will fight our battles, if we con&s;ider that we have engaged in this war, not with an entire dependance upon the arm of fle&s;h, but have been called upon frequently to humble our&s;elves before God, with fa&s;ting and with prayer, to repent of all our &s;ins and turn unto the Lord our God. I tru&s;t there are thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands embark|ing in the pre&s;ent war with the be&s;t and pure&s;t of motives, although I doubt not intere&s;t and honor are the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

motives with many. I &s;incerely believe that the praying part both in Great-Britain and America are intere&s;ted on the &s;ide of American liberty. I doubt not many prayers are this day a&s;cending up to the throne of grace, which I tru&s;t will enter into the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth, in our behalf.</P>
<P N="3">3d. WHEN God intere&s;ts him&s;elf on any one &s;ide, the &s;chemes and machinations of tho&s;e in the oppo&s;ition are turned into fooli&s;hne&s;s. Thus, Job v. 12. 13. 
  <Q>He di&s;appointeth the devices of the crafty, &s;o that their hands cannot perform their enterpri&s;e. He taketh the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s: And the coun&s;el of the froward is carried headlong.</Q>
I think it mu&s;t appear plain to the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver that many of the coun&s;els of the Briti&s;h &s;enate have been fooli&s;hne&s;s, and by no means calculated to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e they had in view. This confe&s;&s;ion is extorted from the Mini&s;try them|&s;elves in their la&s;t debates. The very mea&s;ures taken to divide the Colonies have been over ruled to complete their union. Thus it was in the ca&s;e of the &s;tamp-act, under the &s;pecious name of rai&s;ing a revenue for our own protection. The varni&s;h was &s;oon rubbed off; the horrid en&s;laving &s;cheme was &s;oon detected, and the Colonies from New-Hamp&s;hire to Georgia took the alarm. Here was a chain to bind the whole Colonies, a plan laid to &s;weep away the liberties of more than three millions of American &s;ubjects at once, whereas had they begun with a &s;ingle Colony the mea&s;ure might have en&s;ured them of an ea&s;y conque&s;t.&mdash;The rigorous &s;teps taken again&s;t the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and town of Bo&s;ton, laying it under the mo&s;t into|lerable and unrighteous pro&s;criptions, de&s;troying its trade and blocking up its harbour, enkindled the indignation of every &s;on or liberty on the Continent. Had the vindictive &s;tatutes been le&s;s cruel, they would have better an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of en&s;laving the Colonies. In &s;hort, it would greatly exceed the limits of a &s;ermon to enter into a mi|nute detail of the &s;everal &s;teps taken by the Mini&s;try and Parliament of Great-Britain, which have proved entirely
<PB N="15" REF="014758_0008_0F94DD918C899840">
&s;ubver&s;ive of their favorite &s;cheme. Now does not this &s;hew very clearly that God is again&s;t them, and con&s;equently on our &s;ide? This argument receives additional weight, if we al&s;o con&s;ider the many illu&s;trious characters God has rai&s;ed up in defence of American liberty both in Great-Britain and the Colonies, together with the remarkable wi&s;dom and prodigious extent of knowledge manife&s;ted in all the productions of our Honorable Continental Congre&s;s. Let the encomium of Earl Chatham, that ma&s;ter of poli|tics, eloquence and found rea&s;oning, &s;erve to immortalize their names and tran&s;mit the memory of that illu&s;trious bo|dy with a grateful remembrance to late&s;t po&s;terity. Speaking of their arduous ta&s;k, he &s;ays, "When your Lord&s;hips look at the papers tran&s;mitted us from America, when you con&s;ider their decency, firmne&s;s and wi&s;dom, you cannot but re&s;pect their cau&s;e, and wi&s;h to make it your own&mdash;For my&s;elf I mu&s;t declare and avow, that in all my read|ing and ob&s;ervation, and it has been my favorite &s;tudy;&mdash;I have read Thucidides, and have &s;tudied and admired the ma&s;ter &s;tates of the world, that for &s;olidity of rea&s;on|ing, force of &s;agacity and wi&s;dom of conclu&s;ion, under &s;uch a complication of different circum&s;tances, no nation or body of men can &s;tand in preference to the General Continental Congre&s;s in Philadelphia."&mdash;May they long continue to honour the important tru&s;t, to gain the applau&s;e of the wi&s;e and the good, and be the con&s;tant care of an indulgent heaven!</P>
<P>THUS then it appears from tho&s;e particulars, as well as the &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s we have been ble&s;&s;ed with, that God is on our &s;ide to fight our battles.</P>
<P N="4">4th. IT is u&s;ual for the great Jehovah to intere&s;t him|&s;elf for the enlargement of young and growing &s;tates. Thus we find that he has fought their battles and made them victorious over antient and powerful nations. To this purpo&s;e let us ob&s;erve the conduct of God towards I&s;rael of old, in fighting their battles and &s;ecuring them in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the promi&s;ed land. Thus, P&s;al. cvi. 43. 
  <Q>Many times did he deliver them, but they
<PB N="16" REF="014758_0009_0F94DD9245560720">
  provoked him with their coun&s;el, and were brought low for their iniquity.</Q>
&mdash;So it was with the Prote&s;tant States in Germany in Charles the Fifth's time, Emperor of Ger|many and King of Spain&mdash;The States of Holland and the Independent Cantons of Switzerland demon&s;trate the &s;ame, that God takes care of a young and forming people.</P>
<P>IT has been remarkably the ca&s;e with the I&s;le of Bri|tain, until it aro&s;e to its late glory and opulence. The &s;cale &s;eems now to be turned, and God &s;ays of that nation as of I&s;rael, 
  <Q>Thee only have I known of all the Fami|lies of the earth, therefore will I puni&s;h thee for all thine iniquities.</Q>
&mdash;Now it is very evident that the Co|lonies are but in their infant &s;tate, and are very far from having arrived at all the firmne&s;s and manhood God de|&s;igns. If we look down thro' time but for half a century, to what a prodigious pitch of wealth and greatne&s;s will the Continent of North-America have arrived! I am firmly of the &s;entiment that its future growth will be much more rapid than the pa&s;t; many rea&s;ons might be offered which I mu&s;t omit here. What countle&s;s millions of land yet un|cultivated! What a boundle&s;s extent of country traver&s;ed only by &s;avages and wild bea&s;ts! Now &s;urely God did not make &s;uch a large &s;hare of our globe for nought, or only to be the haunts of wild bea&s;ts, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the naked untutored Indians. The Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t has only glanced upon the &s;hores of this va&s;t Continent, and we may believe that God de&s;igns the &s;ettlement of its remote&s;t boundaries for the enlargement of his &s;on's kingdom; that notable pa&s;&s;age in P&s;al. lxxx. 8. 9. 10. Ver&s;es, has been and will be &s;till more eminently fulfilled in North-America: 
  <Q>Thou ha&s;t brought a vine out of Egypt: Thou ha&s;t ca&s;t out the Heathen, and planted it. Thou prepared&s;t room before it. and did&s;t cau&s;e it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered with the &s;ha|dow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.&mdash;She &s;ent out her boughs unto the &s;ea, and her branches unto the river.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="014758_0009_0F94DD9245560720">
I BELIEVE our American Continent, as it has not yet been &s;tained with the blood of martyrs, will be an a&s;ylum for the per&s;ecuted over all Europe to fly to. America corre&s;ponds to the account we have of the wilderne&s;s to which the Church was driven to &s;eek protection from the fury of the Dragon, Rev. xii. 13. 14. 
  <Q>And when the dragon &s;aw that he was ca&s;t unto the earth, he per&s;ecu|ted the woman which brought forth the man child. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that &s;he might flee into the wilderne&s;s, into her place, where &s;he is nouri&s;hed for a time and times and half a time, from the face of the &s;erpent.</Q>
It is more than probable that this &s;cripture had an eminent fulfilment when our ance&s;tors fled, not from the embraces of the mother, but from the cruelty of the mon&s;ter, and took &s;anctuary in the wilderne&s;s of America. Thus it was when a number of precious &s;ouls landed on the bleak &s;hore of Plymouth in the rigid month of December, without pro|vi&s;ions&mdash;without hou&s;es; but God, as he de&s;igned them for a feed to this new world, procured them favour with the na|tives, who, as I have been told, cheerfully re&s;igned their huts to entertain the newly arrived emigrants. It appears, therefore, that the Church is not yet arrived to its per|fection in America, but will extend wider and wider, un|til it has reached to the Pacific ocean&mdash;Plea&s;ing pro&s;pect! to &s;urvey churches ri&s;ing and the go&s;pel preached, where nothing is now heard but the yells of wild bea&s;ts and nightly orgies of &s;avages! Who would not then &s;tand forth in defence of our liberties, &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the progre&s;s of religion and rapid &s;ettlement of the Colonies? Who would not run the ri&s;k of &s;pilling &s;ome blood for the enlargement of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical body the Church, which he purcha&s;ed with his own mo&s;t precious blood? Glorious cau&s;e, my dear brethren, we are embark|ed in, worthy of a &s;truggle! Yea, we ought to rejoice that God is likely to honour us in making a noble &s;tand for the defence and enlargement of Chri&s;t's kingdom.&mdash;Thus, then, it appears that it is the cau&s;e of God we are engaged in, &s;o need not be di&s;pirited, as he will go before and &s;ight our battles. But this leads me to the
<PB N="18" REF="014758_0010_0F94DD930A41A410">
III THING propo&s;ed, namely, to offer &s;ome grounds of &s;ecurity ari&s;ing from God's being on our &s;ide.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. HIS mo&s;t perfect knowledge of all po&s;&s;ible events, lays a foundation of encouragement. There is not an hair of our heads but is numbered; his infinite knowledge puts him beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a mi&s;take in the whole of his conduct. He at one clear and intuitive view &s;ees all things, with all that infinite variety of their connections; there is not a &s;ingle danger to which we are expo&s;ed, but he fore|&s;ees and can counteract. Human wi&s;dom is not able to guard again&s;t every occurrence that may turn up to di&s;|concert their &s;chemes; hence we find confu&s;ion and di&s;ap|pointment frequently attending the wi&s;e&s;t human coun&s;els. But Jehovah is unerring, and therefore claims coun&s;el and &s;ound judgment as his own. This, therefore, mu&s;t afford the mo&s;t &s;olid &s;atisfaction, that we have one on our &s;ide of infinite knowledge to di&s;cern all future events and to di|rect matters &s;o as to turn the coun&s;els of our enemies into fooli&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2d. GOD has not only the mo&s;t perfect knowledge of all per&s;ons and things, but has the &s;ecret management of all in his own hand. His kingdom ruleth over all, and the hearts of Kings and Princes are in his hand; he rules by a &s;ecret and irre&s;i&s;tible &s;way in the armies of heaven and among&s;t the inhabitants of the earth. The reins of uni|ver&s;al government are in his hand. The wheels of nature, however intricate, are under his direction; &s;torms and thunder obey him; the elements are all &s;ub&s;ervient to his plea&s;ure; for tho&s;e who are fighting for him, he can even &s;u&s;pend the laws of nature, arre&s;t the &s;un in his rapid cour&s;e, until his victories are gained. All creatures are at his nod, &s;o that they that are with us, God being on our &s;ide, are more than tho&s;e that are again&s;t us. He can employ all the ho&s;ts of heaven, can give commi&s;&s;ion to a &s;ingle de&s;troying angel to cut off in one night an hundred and four&s;core thou&s;and, as in Sennacherib's army. Who then would be afraid to embark in the cau&s;e of &s;uch an illu&s;trious leader, who has all power in heaven and on earth in his hand? Nay, who would not ru&s;h into thicke&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="014758_0010_0F94DD930A41A410">
dangers, when they are a&s;&s;ured that the cau&s;e is the cau&s;e of God, and that there is not a bullet, as King William u&s;ed to &s;ay, but has its billet?</P>
<P N="3">3. HE is bound by his faithfulne&s;s to &s;tand by and &s;up|port a righteous cau&s;e.&mdash;The righteous Lord loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s. Although he may &s;uffer a good cau&s;e to meet with oppo&s;ition, and the de&s;igns of wicked men for a while to pro&s;per, yet 
  <Q>he that &s;itteth in the heavens &s;hall laugh; the Lord &s;hall have them in deri&s;ion; then &s;hall he &s;peak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ure.</Q>
Thus God promi&s;es to Jo&s;hua, 
  <Q>One man of you &s;hall cha&s;e a thou&s;and; for the Lord your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promi&s;ed. So &s;hall the Lord of ho&s;ts come down to fight for Mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.</Q></P>
<P>LASTLY, Omnipotence is engaged on our &s;ide. God is not only unerring in his coun&s;els, but omnipotent to put them into execution. He can ca&s;t the wicked down to hell, and all the nations that forget God. He is, in &s;hort, a &s;trong rock for defence; he teaches our hands to war, and our fingers to fight. In one word, he is the Lord &s;trong in battle.</P>
<P>IMPROVEMENT.&mdash;1&s;t. This &s;ubject &s;hews us the great nece&s;&s;ity of per&s;onal covenanting with God and enli&s;ting under the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the glorious Captain of our &s;alvation. It would be an affecting thought, that however glorious the cau&s;e in which we are engaged, and however ready to embark therein from certain con&s;idera|tions, as being the cau&s;e of Liberty, yet we our&s;elves &s;hould be &s;ervants to &s;in and &s;laves to lu&s;t. This is a mat|ter in which every &s;oul pre&s;ent is concerned; we have, my dear brethren, all of us enemies to conflict with which we cannot avoid, and which by no power or &s;kill of our own we can defeat. We have to wre&s;tle not only with fle&s;h and blood, but with principalities and powers, and &s;piritual wickedne&s;s in high places. There is a &s;piritual armour we mu&s;t put on to come off conquerors; there is a glorious General we mu&s;t enli&s;t under, to en&s;ure us of victory. No leader inferior to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who
<PB N="20" REF="014758_0011_0F94DD93CBA9D700">
has him&s;elf &s;poiled principalities and powers can put Satan under our feet. Here is the greate&s;t victory we ever can gain; a victory over the world, our own lu&s;ts and all the internal ho&s;ts of hell. As the victory is great, &s;o the prize to every overcomer is al&s;o great. 
  <Q>To him that over|cometh,</Q>
&s;ays the Captain of our &s;alvation, 
  <Q>Will I grant to &s;it with me in my throne, even as I al&s;o over|came, and am &s;it down with my Father in his throne. <BIBL>Rev. iii. 21.</BIBL></Q>
He that overcometh &s;hall inherit all things. Shall heroes and generals contend for honors of a day; for the laurel that mu&s;t &s;ooner or later decay, and &s;hall not we fight and &s;trive for an inheritance incorruptible, unde|filed and that fadeth not away?</P>
<P N="2">2d. THIS &s;ubject &s;hews us of what infinite moment it is in the pre&s;ent &s;truggle to have God on our &s;ide to go before us and to fight our battles. The race is not always to the &s;wift nor the battle to the &s;trong. If God be for us we need not be di&s;mayed at all the armed legions that are coming again&s;t us. At mo&s;t it is but an arm of fle&s;h; and   
  <Q>cur&s;ed is the man that tru&s;teth in man, and maketh fle&s;h his arm, and who&s;e heart departeth from the Lord. <BIBL>Jer. xvii 5.</BIBL></Q>

What a &s;ignal di&s;play of his power in our behalf at the Newfoundland fi&s;hery, and al&s;o in the river Thames, when his winds blew and they &s;ank like lead in the great waters!</P>
<P N="3">3d. IS it the cau&s;e of God, as you have heard, that we are engaged in? Hence learn how ready we ought to be to embark therein. Cur&s;ed be he that keepeth back his &s;word from blood in &s;uch a cau&s;e. There can, &s;trictly &s;peaking, be no neutrality in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e&mdash;he that is not with us mu&s;t be again&s;t us. I fear many will &s;hrink back, and under &s;ome pretext de&s;ert the cau&s;e, when their a&s;&s;i&s;tance will be mo&s;t needed. Be not di&s;mayed, my dear brethren; if it is the cau&s;e of God, as you have heard, &s;ucce&s;s is certain. What though we &s;hould meet with
<PB N="21" REF="014758_0011_0F94DD93CBA9D700">
many repul&s;es? The &s;truggle is of &s;uch va&s;t importance to us and unborn millions, that every lover of God, reli|gion and po&s;terity, &s;hould vie one with another who &s;hould be foremo&s;t in action. If we fall in the field, we die as &s;ecure as if on our knees to God in prayer. If we are prepared to die on our beds, &s;o are we in the field. It will be an ea&s;y tran&s;lation to go from fighting to wear|ing an unfullied crown of glory. Every true chri&s;tian, having embarked in the pre&s;ent cau&s;e as the cau&s;e of God and religion, if he dies in the field, will die a martyr for Chri&s;t and will receive a martyr's crown. Route then, my dear brethren; quit your&s;elves like men; &s;tand ready to march into the field when God and your country call.</P>
<P N="4">4th. BUT I mu&s;t addre&s;s my&s;elf in a particular manner to you, Gentlemen Officers and Privates, who appear before us to day, engaged in your country's cau&s;e.</P>
<P>FIRST, as to the Officers&mdash;</P>
<P>PERMIT me to tell you, Gentlemen, that, under God, much will depend upon your prudent, wi&s;e and manly behaviour. You have not only to direct your own con|duct, but the conduct and behaviour of tho&s;e under your care. You are to con&s;ider that the cau&s;e you are engaged in is the cau&s;e of God, and that you are to conduct your|&s;elves worthy of &s;uch a glorious undertaking. Remember that you are not called out to fight the Devil's battles, but the battles of the Lord of ho&s;ts. See to it, then, that you do honour to the cau&s;e, and not let it &s;uffer through your default. As to your private conduct, &s;ee that it be &s;ober, decent and re&s;pectable. Never look upon it as a qualifi|cation for officers fighting the Lord's battles, to cur&s;e and &s;wear, and take God's name in vain. Authority will be better &s;ecured by your manly and religious behaviour, than by all the imprecations you can u&s;e to your fellow men. Suffer not your&s;elves to be governed by appetite, fancy or humour, but by rea&s;on and con&s;cience; attend to the di&s;po&s;itions and characters of tho&s;e under your care, that you may be the better fitted to regulate their conduct; carefully attend to the mode of conduct be&s;t adapted to the variety of circum&s;tances you may be in; con&s;ider what
<PB N="22" REF="014758_0012_0F94DD948B521628">
is decorous and what indecorous, and what is u&s;ually ap|proved of by the mo&s;t wi&s;e and judicious in &s;uch circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>BE grave and &s;edate in oppo&s;ition to a light and frothy temper; let a graceful compo&s;edne&s;s appear even in your gaye&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, and make it evident that your minds are under a firm impre&s;&s;ion of the divine pre&s;ence. Be not &s;lothful, but diligent in your calling; be re&s;olute, quit your&s;elves like men, and above all be re&s;olute in religion and determined that for your part, let others do as they will, you will &s;erve the Lord. Let it appear that you dare be religious even in a camp. Not that I would have you always gloomy or melancholy; no, the gravity I recom|mend is con&s;i&s;tent with chearfulne&s;s, and even &s;uppo&s;es it. Serve the Lord with gladne&s;s; thou meete&s;t him that re|joiceth and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s. I would not be under|&s;tood as though I meant to cut off innocent and natural mirth, but only to direct it into a proper channel; this, as an in&s;pired writer ob&s;erves, may do good, but is to be u&s;ed as a medicine. Avoid exce&s;s either in eating or drinking; deny your&s;elves of all irregular and &s;en&s;ual gratifications. Seek not the vain applau&s;e of mortals, but &s;tudy to have the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience. Be valiant and cou|ragious in the hour of battle, if called to it; never flinch from a dangerous po&s;t, when duty urges you on; play the man for your God and Country; be prepared to meet every event, and try to have God your God and everla&s;t|ing portion.&mdash;It may be the la&s;t addre&s;s I ever &s;hall make you; I would that it might be remembered. Let me &s;um up all in a few words&mdash;Endure hardne&s;s as good &s;ol|diers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; put ye on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to &s;tand again&s;t all the wiles of the Devil; be faithful unto the death, and ye have the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t that ye &s;hall receive a crown of life.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t &s;peak a word to the Soldiers&mdash;Happy con&s;ideration if ye were all enli&s;ted under the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t! Let me intreat you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the im|portance of the cau&s;e you have engaged in; remember as you have heard, that it is the cau&s;e of God. Be regular
<PB N="23" REF="014758_0012_0F94DD948B521628">
in your conduct and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to tho&s;e under who&s;e im|mediate care you are put; a&s;&s;ume no undue airs of import|ance, nor affect to be noticed by tho&s;e about you; be not arrogant, but let your behaviour manife&s;t a proper defer|ence to your &s;uperiors; never affect to appear above your rank, nor be a&s;hamed of it; take heed, as you are to min|gle with per&s;ons of every character, not to be tempted by profane fops, to treat the great concerns of religion with contempt. Carry a favour of religion with you wherever you are; take heed of fle&s;hly lu&s;ts that war again&s;t the &s;oul; love not ea&s;e and &s;loth, but endure hardne&s;s; be not nice or delicate in eating or drinking; guard again&s;t immode&s;t and uncha&s;te conver&s;ation; let no corrupt com|munication proceed out of your mouth; fornication and all uncleane&s;s, let it not be named among&s;t you as becomes Chri&s;tians; avoid fooli&s;h talking and filthy je&s;ting; be valiant for the cau&s;e you are engaged in; never &s;hrink in an hour of battle. And now, my dear Gentlemen Officers and Soldiers, may the divine protection be your &s;hield in an hour of danger; may you have &s;ucce&s;s equal to the goodne&s;s of your cau&s;e; may you have the plea&s;ing re|flection of being improved by the God of heaven for &s;e|curing liberty both civil and religious to this new world; may the Lord go before you, direct you in all your ways, animate you in every important enterpri&s;e, guard your heads from the winged me&s;&s;engers of death, and bring you at la&s;t to his heavenly kingdom. I mu&s;t take my leave, and collect my whole &s;oul in bidding you an hearty farewel.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t have done with a word to the a&s;&s;embly at large. Numbers of you, my dear brethren, are not like to be called into the field of action; But is there nothing incumbent upon you to do? Are not &s;uch as are hazard|ing their lives in our common defence entitled to your e&s;teem, prayers and a&s;&s;i&s;tance? Prayer has done much in &s;uch ca&s;es; the fervent prayer of the righteous man avail|eth much: Thus it was in the ca&s;e or Mo&s;es, when Aaron and H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">r held up his hands, doubtle&s;s in a praying po&s;ture I&s;rael prevailed. Every one pre&s;ent who has liberty

or property to defend, is deeply concerned in the pre&s;ent &s;truggle. Liberty or Slavery is to be tran&s;mitted to our numerous offspring. This Continent will either be the glory of the earth, or a place of more than Egyptian bondage. It is worth while to exert our&s;elves, and not &s;uffer our land to be over-run with Slavery and Tyranny. Let not po&s;terity have rea&s;on to cur&s;e us, when we &s;hall be lying in the &s;ilent grave. Let us imitate the conduct of good Jeho&s;haphat, 
  <Q><BIBL>2 Chron. xx. 12.</BIBL> O our God wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might again&s;t this great company that cometh again&s;t us, nei|ther know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</Q>
May the Lord direct our eyes to him&s;elf; may he go be|fore and fight our battles; may he once more re&s;tore peace in our land, through Je&s;us. AMEN.</P>
