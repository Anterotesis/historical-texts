<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>_PErhaps the Reader unacquainted with the Per&s;on who &s;ends the&s;e few Lines to our <HI>Young People</HI>; will de&s;ire &s;ome Informa|tion concerning her &amp; her Circum&s;tances; they being very peculiar and uncommon: I &s;hall in An&s;wer to the Reque&s;t of divers of her near Re|latives, give the Reader an Account of the &s;ame, as followeth: <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P>THis Young Woman (which I think I may without Vanity call a <HI>Young Saint</HI>) is the Daughter of Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Wheeler</HI> and <HI>Sarah</HI> his Wife, originally of <HI>Concord</HI> in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay in N. E. who with their Family removed from thence unto the Town of <HI>Plainfield</HI> in <HI>Connecticut</HI> in the Year 1704, and it has plea&s;ed GOD to ble&s;s the&s;e Parents with a numerous Off-&s;pring, three Sons and ten Daughters; of which ten our young Author is the fourth; being born in the Year 1706: was a Child very remarkable for Health and Agillity of Body, until the Twentieth Year of her Age; and then was taken Sick of the burning Ague in the latter end of the Summer 1726, and hath never &s;ince enjoyed one Days health; &s;he was in the Sum|mer following brought &s;o low, as that &s;he was wholly Confin'd to her Bed, (which Confinement continues to this Day) and reduced to &s;uch ex|ceeding low Circum&s;tances, as that every Day, for many Days and Months together, was expected by all about her, would have been her la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="003732_0002_1002037061477C48">Her Strength was &s;o intirely gone as &s;he could not move her Head, Hand or Foot &s;o as to help her &s;elf in the lea&s;t; and her Speech wholly failed; &s;o that &s;he has not been able to &s;peak by whi&s;pering &s;o as to be heard by any, but tho&s;e of the Family, much u&s;ed to her; and they gue&s;&s;ing more by the motion of her Lips than by any Voice which could be heard. Her Fle&s;h is much con&s;umed: Her Ap|petite to Food is &s;o gone, that it is admirable to think how &s;he has been &s;u&s;tained; her dige&s;tive Faculty &s;o weak, that &s;he has not been able to Eat either Bread of Fle&s;h of any &s;ort, for the &s;pace of Five Years and more; &s;upported only (as to out|ward Means) by &s;ome thin, liquid Food, put into her Mouth with a Spoon; who will &s;ay but that the Power and Goodne&s;s of GOD is very remar|kable in &s;u&s;taining her &s;o long time by &s;uch &s;lender and incon&s;iderable Means.</P>
<P>No Care or Co&s;t, has been wanting on her be|half; Phy&s;icians far and near, have been con&s;ulted and improved (to great Expence) for her. Nor have her Parents neglected to &s;eek to GOD for a Ble&s;&s;ing on their Endeavours of this Nature: Divers Days of Fa&s;ting and Prayer have been attended in her Father's Hou&s;e, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Pa&s;tor of the Church here, and other chri&s;tian Friends, and al&s;o the Pa&s;tors of divers of the neighbouring Churches; and &s;everal Sermons adapted to the Oc|ca&s;ion, have been Preacht in her hearing; which by the Lines &s;he now &s;ends abroad (I believe) you will think GOD has Sanctified to her for &s;aving good. For I think, Reader, if you &s;hall want Cha|rity for her, you fall under another great Want, and want the one thing needful for your &s;elf.</P>
<P>She &s;till remains weak and low, but (thanks be to GOD) &s;he is under &s;ome revivings. Mo&s;t

<P>I think indeed &s;he &s;eems to be under the power|ful Impre&s;&s;ions of the Spirit of GOD, and touch'd with a &s;ence of the prevailing Sins of the pre&s;ent Times, laments the decay of the Power of Godli|ne&s;s among&s;t us.</P>
<P>In one of my la&s;t Conferences with her, I could not but take peculiar Notice of a &s;ad &s;urprize &s;he &s;eemed to be in from her being informed of &s;ome Families which lived in the Neglect of <HI>Family Prayer</HI>; &s;o affected was &s;he in her Meditation on it, that &s;he ver&s;ify'd upon it; and rehear&s;t to me &s;everal of the Ver&s;es &s;he had compo&s;ed: one of which I will here Record; hoping that it may jog &s;ome of 'em that ly &s;noaring in &s;uch a &s;hameful Omi&s;&s;ion; and it runs after this manner,</P>
<Q><L>Poor, wretched and vile Sinners all</L>
<L>Rank'd with the heathen Nation,</L>
<L>Who unto GOD ne'er Pray nor Call,</L>
<L>For Pardon and Salvation.</L></Q>
<P>(<HI>I'll add another and &s;ay,</HI>)</P>
<L>What dreadful Threats, O direful Wrath!</L>
<L>Such Families fall under,</L>
<L>Who will tread that forbidden Path</L>
<L>Full &s;how'd with Bolts of Thunder.</L>
<P><PB N="v" REF="003732_0003_100252F453BFD8E0">You'l find in her Addre&s;s to young People, a Caution again&s;t &s;uch vile Omi&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P>The Reader acquainted with &s;acred Writ, will remember, that it is intimated to us by our Savi|our in his Parable concerning the <HI>rich Man</HI> and <HI>Lazarus,</HI> that the doleful Inhabitants of the Place of Torment, do imagine, that <HI>if one were &s;ent</HI> to their Fellow Sinners on Earth <HI>from the Dead they would repent.</HI></P>
<P>Behold here we have Warning given to our young People; which may in &s;ome &s;en&s;e be called <HI>Warning from the Dead</HI>: tho' not ab&s;olutely &s;o, yet the Per&s;on who gives it, has been numbered among the Dead, in our Expectation, for a long Time, until now &s;he experiences what we may call, a <HI>&s;ort of Re&s;urrection.</HI> The In&s;tance we have in her, is very uncommon, and I think what &s;he now offers is worthy of Ob&s;ervation from us all.</P>
<P>I will but add one word by way of <HI>Apology</HI> for my &s;elf, in pre&s;uming to gratify her, in granting her the u&s;e of my Pen; po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome among our young People may have arrived to that height of Profanity as to make a Ridicule and a Scoff at what I have here performed; to &s;uch I an&s;wer in &s;hort, I value not their Scoff a ru&s;h, only would &s;ay to &s;uch, as <HI>Paul</HI> to the Jailer, <HI>Do thy &s;elf no harm.</HI></P>
<P>But perhaps the Aged, Sober &amp; judicious Reader will admire at my pre&s;umption herein; to &s;uch I would with all imaginable Humility &s;ay, I am ready to admire with you too: But when I was &s;o oft in|vited

<P>I hope I can truly &s;ay, I have been much con|cerned for the Intere&s;t of Religion among us; and tho'tful what I in particular may do that may any way tend to revive the too, too vi&s;ible Decays of it: When this Invitation was urged upon me, I dare not wholly reject it, lea&s;t I &s;hould let &s;lip an Opportunity of being &s;ome way &s;erviceable to the Intere&s;t of Religion, and the good of Souls.</P>

<HEAD>AN Addre&s;s to young People, BY <HI>Mercy Wheeler</HI> Of <HI>Plainfield, June 8. 1732.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>_MY dear Friends, Relatives &amp; Neigh|bours,</HI> who are now in your Youth, and come to that Time of Life, which is called the Flower of the Age. It is well known to many of you, that the great and &s;overeign Jehovah, who doth what&s;oever He plea&s;eth in Heaven, Earth, Sea and all deep Places, hath been very &s;ignal and remarkable in his di&s;pen&s;ations towards me.</P>
<P>He has laid me upon a Bed of Langui&s;hing, for the Space of more than Five Years pa&s;t already, the greate&s;t part of which time I have been reduced to &s;uch low Circum&s;tances that I have not been able to &s;peak with an audible Voice: until now of late it hath plea&s;ed GOD of his abundant good|ne&s;s to grant me &s;uch reviving, as to be able to &s;peak with an audible, tho' a low Voice.</P>
<P>And now GOD has given me ability, I think it my Duty to you O young People, to addre&s;s my &s;elf to you, by way of Advi&s;e, Coun&s;el &amp; Caution: to you which are near to me in the bonds of Na|ture, in an e&s;pecial manner; yea and to all the whole Neighbourhood, and whom&s;oever are or &s;hall be acquainted with my Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>O <HI>young People</HI>! you that are of my own Gene|ration; who are in the Prime and Flower of your Days, I mu&s;t tell you that I think you have in me, I mean in what GOD has done unto me, a very
<PB N="2" REF="003732_0005_100252F935BAE200">loud Lecture preach'd to you: and O that you, all of you may be &s;uch Per&s;ons of Wi&s;dom as to hear the rod and Him that hath appointed it!</P>
<P>Remember! Oh young People, remember that Childhood and Youth is Vanity. What &s;hall I &s;ay to you to per&s;wade you to be &s;erious? How &s;hall I order my Speech to you, &s;o as to prevail with you to hearken to me now, that &s;o GOD may hearken to you another Day?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, that tho' Youth be indeed the Flower of the Age, yet it is the mo&s;t dangerous Sea&s;on of the Mind. I have found it &s;o, and you will &s;ee it to be &s;o ere-long, when your Eyes are open to &s;ee things as indeed they are.</P>
<P>My advi&s;e to you is, Oh labour to &s;ee &amp; appre|hend your danger; lea&s;t you fall into fooli&s;h and hurtful Lu&s;ts which drown Men and Women in De&s;truction and Perdition.</P>
<P>O flee youthful Lu&s;ts, beware, be warned by the Harms and Falls of others, remember Death is ha&s;tening; it is appointed for Man once to Die, and after that the Judgment.</P>
<P>Remember me, you that know me, and are ac|quainted with me: O how &s;uddenly has GOD bla&s;ted my youthful Vigour, and lay'd me upon a Bed of pining Sickne&s;s to this Day. In the Spring of my Days, or before the Spring was fully advan|ced, it is become Autumn with me; the Leaves fall apace, as if the Winter of Death were ju&s;t approach|ing upon, that I may &s;ay with &s;ick <HI>Hezekiah, I am deprived of the re&s;idue of my Days, and &s;hall &s;ee Man no more, with the Inhabitants of the World.</HI> And how &s;oon it may be your Ca&s;e you know not; nor are you &s;ure (if GOD &s;hall give &s;o much Warning, and not &s;natch you away by &s;ome &s;udden accidental and violent Death) that GOD will afford to you the Mercy He hath vouch&s;afed to me; it may be you may be deprived of the U&s;e of your
<PB N="3" REF="003732_0005_100252F935BAE200">Rea&s;on, (as is frequently the Ca&s;e of the vi&s;ited with Mortal di&s;tempers) and then how impo&s;&s;ible will it be for you to do your great Work, when you cannot &s;o much as apprehend what Work you have to do. O my friends, believe me, believe me, the Time of Health is the very be&s;t Time for you to prepare for Death in.</P>
<P>I deny not but that GOD doth &s;ometimes mag|nify his &s;overeign Grace to Sinners; by &s;anctifying long and tedious Sickne&s;s for &s;aving Good to their Souls, I hope he has done it for me (and I adore his Grace for ever on the Account whereof. But I mu&s;t tell you, it was indeed hard Work to bear the Pains of Body, which my di&s;ea&s;e laid me un|der, and at the &s;ame: Time to grapple with the wracking Terrors of a wounded Spirit which indeed who can bear. And I do &s;adly, and greatly la|ment my Sin and Folly in neglecting to improve my Health, while GOD was plea&s;ed to afford it to me: and &s;o will you if you neglect to improve yours.</P>
<P>The be&s;t that you can po&s;&s;ibly imagine (if you continue to delay to make your Peace with GOD now in the time of Health and Pro&s;perity) is, I &s;ay, the be&s;t you can po&s;&s;ibly imagine is, you make &s;ad Work for a mo&s;t bitter Repentance here-after.</P>
<P>And if this be the be&s;t you can po&s;&s;ibly Hope for, (and that at the utmo&s;t Hazard too,) What may the Wor&s;t be, if GOD in Ju&s;tice &s;ay, becau&s;e <HI>I have called and ye have refu&s;ed, therefore I will laugh at your Calamity, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Fear cometh, when your Fear cometh us De&s;olation, and your De&s;truction cometh as Whirlwind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h cometh upon you</HI> then a great Ran&s;om cannot deliver you.</P>
<P>If once it comes to this: that by your quenching and grieving the Holy Spirit of GOD, you &s;o provoke him as to take his final farewell of your forsaken Souls, and GOD <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are in his Wrath you
<PB N="4" REF="003732_0006_100252FAC179AF80">&s;hall never enter into his re&s;t</HI>: and for ought you or I know, if you &s;till delay, this may be the dire|ful and dreadful con&s;equence of your delaying in this mo&s;t important Affair.</P>
<P>And if at la&s;t this &s;hould be your dreadful Doom, then no Tongue of Man or Angel can expre&s;s the Horror that may ju&s;tly, &amp; will mo&s;t certainly, &s;ooner later, &s;eize upon you.</P>
<P>O then! Let me Addre&s;s my &s;elf to you with the greate&s;t importunity I am capable of: Advi&s;ing you to delay no longer; make ha&s;te, <HI>flee to the City of Refuge, before the Avenger of Blood over|take you.</HI></P>
<P>Secure to your &s;elves a part in CHRIST the on|ly Refuge of Souls, Now, before it be too late: From whence &s;hall I fetch the Weapons of Spiritual Armour, my Arrows (while I draw my Bow at a venture) which GOD &s;hall &s;o direct as that they &s;hall reach your Hearts, the Mark I aim at.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t be fetcht from the quiver of the Word of GOD, that great Store hou&s;e of Spiritual Armour.</P>
<P>I will recommend to you that wi&s;e &amp; &s;age Ad|vice, given by the wi&s;e&s;t of all mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Men, the Royal and Renowned Preacher King <HI>Solomon,</HI> divinely in&s;pired; which Advice is given for the Conduct of Youth in all &s;ucceeding Generations to the World's end; recorded in Eccl. xii.1. <HI>Remember Now thy Creator, in the days of thy Youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou &s;halt &s;ay, I have no plea&s;ure in them.</HI> This is Coun&s;el given us by GOD him&s;elf; in&s;erted in his Oracles for your Conduct and mine.</P>
<P>O let not you or I forget <HI>GOD that made us,</HI> nor be <HI>unmindful of the Rock of our Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Let us remember our Creator, and we &s;hall re|member our Sins, by which we have broken his Laws, and expo&s;ed our &s;elves to the Cur&s;e threatned to the breakers of it.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003732_0006_100252FAC179AF80">Remember your Creator and you'l remember the Redeemer, and labour to obtain an Intere&s;t in him; which is <HI>the One Thing needfull</HI>; and Wo to us if we obtain it not.</P>
<P>This is the Sum of all I have to &s;ay to you; O my Friends, my Brothers, my Si&s;ters, and Rela|tives, near to me, or more remote and further off; Neighbours and all who may be Entertained with the&s;e Lines; I a&s;&s;ure you all, that this is all my De&s;ire on your behalf; and it will be all your Salvation, if you obtain the &s;ame, even a part in the lovely <HI>JESUS.</HI> O do but get your Eyes open to &s;ee and behold the incomparable Beauty of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and I am &s;ure you will be enamoured with Him, and &s;ay with me, and all Chri&s;t-prizers; <HI>He is the chiefe&s;t of ten Thou&s;and, He is altogether Lovely.</HI></P>
<P>Oh that I could, (tho' but in &s;ome poor broken Expre&s;&s;ions) &s;et before you the Beauty and Excel|lency of the lovely &amp; all-beautiful <HI>Jesus</HI>! I Hope I can truly &s;ay, that GOD of his abundant Grace hath made him Precious, mo&s;t Precious to me; I can &s;ay, I Prize him above all other Good what|&s;oever. Mountains of Gold and Pearls, are not to be compared with him. But what do I attempt to repre&s;ent to you, an infinite Good, by the Words of a poor finite nothing Creature, and have not the Tongue of the Learned neither; which if I had, Words would fail, &amp; the mo&s;t rai&s;ed humane Tho't would fall infinitely &s;hort of a true &amp; full Repre|&s;entation of him, who is the brightne&s;s of the Fa|thers Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on, and upholds all things by the Word of his Power; Who when he had by him&s;elf purged our Sins, &s;at down at the Right Hand of the Maje&s;ty on high. Who can by &s;earching find out this GOD-Man; none can find out this Almighty Redeemer to Perfection.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003732_0007_100252FC4ABD5038">By the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions &amp; Words which want form, you may conceive &s;omething of the E&s;teem, which I de&s;ire always to maintain of my ever-ble&s;&s;ed Re|deemer: Will you Oh young People learn to Adore Him with me Now; that &s;o we may enjoy Him together forever hereafter; when his Redeemed Ones &s;hall have a more full and transforming View of him, for <HI>then we &s;hall &s;ee Him as He is.</HI></P>
<P>One Arrow more I mu&s;t draw out of the divine Quiver, and it &s;hall be that mo&s;t important Que&s;tion propounded to us by the Redeemer him&s;elf, a much greater than King <HI>Solomon,</HI> and &s;pake as never Man &s;pake: Which grand Inquiry of his we have in the Go&s;pel of S. Mat.16.26. <HI>What is a Man profited, if he &s;hall gain the whole World and lo&s;e his own Soul, or what will a Man give in Exchange for his soul?</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e words of our Saviour we may apprehend &s;omething of the Value which is put upon a Soul by Him who alone knew the true Worth of a Soul, He and He only pay'd the Ran&s;om of Souls, there|fore He knew full well what the Price of a Soul mu&s;t be &s;et at.</P>
<P>The whole World is a Price too mean and low to &s;et an immortal Soul at.

<P>We mu&s;t all acknowledge that our Souls are lo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI>: And we our &s;elves per&s;o|na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> forfeited the Happine&s;s of our Souls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Divine Ju&s;tice.

<P>This brings me again to what I told you before is all my De&s;ire concerning you: that a part in this great Saviour, &amp; the great Salvation procured by Him for us Sinners, may be your Portion: Let me urge it upon you to labour to obtain it, with all your might; delay not; dallie not; trifle not in this mo&s;t great and important Bu&s;ine&s;s. I know not how to leave off urging you, or let you go, till you cry out, <HI>None but Chri&s;t, None but Chri&s;t</HI>! and I hear you &s;ay, Give me Chri&s;t, or el&s;e I die.</P>
<P>Are you de&s;irous of a Chri&s;t? Do you &s;ee your peri&s;hing Condition without him, and that a part in him is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for you? My Advice to you all is this:</P>
<P>O prize the Go&s;pel, and Go&s;pel Ordinances. O my Friends, I long to enjoy Publick Ordinances; I think I de&s;ire Health for nothing more, than to be able to come to the Publick Ordinances of GOD's Hou&s;e; e&s;pecially that I may Commemorate the Dying Love of my Redeemer in that High and Holy Ordinance of the Supper: To come to that Go&s;pel Fea&s;t; which if GOD in his &s;overeignty &s;hall deny me ability for, I hope he will accept the Will for the Deed: As for you that are in Health prize and improve it, it is the ordinary Means of Salvation. O have a care you do not put a &s;light upon the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation of the Word of Life; and beware you do not entertain any prejudice a|gain&s;t any clear Go&s;pel Truths; or again&s;t any of the faithful di&s;pen&s;ers of the &s;ame. Mind well what the great King &amp; Saviour of the Church hath with his own Mouth &s;aid in this Matter, <HI>He that de&s;pi&s;eth you, de&s;pi&s;eth me,</HI> &amp;c. What a dreadful thing is it to de&s;pi&s;e Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003732_0008_100252FE0914D440">Go as con&s;tantly as you can to hear what GOD will &s;peak to you; don't &s;uffer Trifles to divert you; let not a little Cold, wet or dull Weather, keep you at Home, when you are in Health; and may go to the Hou&s;e of GOD, if you will.</P>
<P>And don't neglect private, or &s;ecret Opportuni|ties for Communion with GOD: Make Con&s;cience of &s;ecret Prayer daily; and attend con&s;tantly Fa|mily Wor&s;hip you that have the Advantage of it.</P>
<P>And Oh, let no young Couple come together in Marriage, and dare to live in the horrible Omi&s;&s;ion of Family Prayer. I am amazed to think that ever &s;uch Go&s;pellers as we in <HI>New-England</HI> are, &s;hould any of us dare to live without Family Prayer. What &s;ays Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> of &s;uch Hou&s;es?
<Q>The roaring Lion (&s;ays he) doth ramp and rage there without controul:</Q>
And how doth the weeping Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> imprecate the divine Vengeance, on &s;uch &s;uch Familys, <HI>Chap.</HI> 10.25. Yea how doth GOD him&s;elf threaten them, &s;ay|ing, <HI>I will pour out my Fury upon the Heathen that know me not, and on the Families that call not upon my Name.</HI> Oh let none indulge them&s;elves in &s;uch a fearful Omi&s;&s;ion. Oh young People! I could fill my Mouth with Arguments to per&s;wade you to become truly pious; Fear of Evil on the one Hand; and hope and expectation of Good on the other, are two great &s;waying Con&s;iderations with rational Agents: I have already &s;aid &s;ome|thing of the great Danger of Delays.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now add a Word as to the <HI>great Good</HI> that will acrue to you, if you will now comply and in good earne&s;t &s;et your &s;elves to &s;eek and &s;erve God with perfect Hearts and willing Minds, you'l then be in the way to all manner of Good, to have the Ble&s;&s;ings of the upper and nether Springs, of God's Throne and of his Foot-&s;tool conferred up|on you.&mdash; Will <HI>Profit</HI> allure you? truly there is
<PB N="9" REF="003732_0008_100252FE0914D440">no Gold, or worldly Gain, that is worthy to be compared with the <HI>Gold tryed in the Fire,</HI> which Chri&s;t coun&s;els us to buy of him, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.18.&mdash;Will <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> invite you? There is no Plea&s;ure which the Things of Time &amp; Sen&s;e afford us, wor|thy to be named the &s;ame Day with the Plea&s;ure that is to be enjoyed in Communion with God, and walking in the Ways of Wi&s;dom; all who&s;e <HI>Ways are Ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and who&s;e Paths are Peace.</HI>&mdash;Will <HI>Honour</HI> &s;way with you? There's no Honour like that which come from God only, or the Honour which Chri&s;t will one day put up|on them that Love and Honour him.&mdash; Is <HI>Peace</HI> a thing de&s;ireable with you? There is no Peace with our fellow-Creatures, to be compared to the Peace which Believers have with God, thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which verily <HI>pa&s;&s;eth all un|der&s;tanding.</HI>&mdash; Once more, Will <HI>Joys</HI> or <HI>Songs</HI> charm you? Sure I am, that there is no Joy like the <HI>Joy of the Lord,</HI> which is our Strength, who have &s;ecured to our &s;elves a part in a glorious Chri&s;t. No carnal Mirth or Gladne&s;s which is comparable to that of the Ran&s;omed of the Lord, who &s;hall return and come to Zion with <HI>Songs of everla&s;ting Joy upon their Heads, and &s;hall obtain Joy and Gladne&s;s,</HI> and Sorrow &s;hall flee away, I&s;a.35.10.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay more, My Strength of Body is &s;mall; and it is hard for me to &s;peak: I am wil|ling to &s;pend all the Strength I have, were it much more than it is, for your Good; might I be any way In&s;trumental of any &s;aving Good to your Souls; or any one Soul. May God ble&s;s what you &s;ee in me, and what you now hear from me, for &s;aving Good to you, I &s;hall never repent the Pains I now take.</P>
<P>O my Friends, Do you do your part, that what you have &s;een of God's Dealings with me, and what you now hear from me, may not ri&s;e up in
<PB REF="003732_0009_1002530095AECBE8">Judgment again&s;t you in the great Day of Account.</P>
<P>THUS, Friends, (who&s;e Souls are of very great Value with me) I have by the help of God, and the u&s;e of a borrowed Pen, done and accompli&s;h'd what I have long de&s;ired to do. I leave the&s;e Lines with you as being the be&s;t Advice I can po&s;&s;i|ble give to you, if I knew I &s;hould never &s;ee any of you more in the World, or if I &s;hould yet have further Opportunities to Conver&s;e with you.</P>
<P>I intreat you for your Soul's &s;ake, Give ear to what I have now &s;aid to you; &s;o out of the Mouth of a Babe and Suckling, God &s;hall ordain Strength and perfect his own Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>And now, Whether it &s;hall plea&s;e God to con|tinue me with you &s;till, under my pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances, or otherwi&s;e, (that Matter I de&s;ire to leave with God, and would entirely re&s;ign to his holy and ble&s;&s;ed Will and Plea&s;ure therein) I a&s;&s;ure you my Kinsfolk according to the Fle&s;h, and all others, to whom I have directed the&s;e Lines, (and the Pen-man does doubtle&s;s join with me,) My Hearts De&s;ire and Prayer to GOD for you is, that your Souls may be eternally &s;aved.</P>
