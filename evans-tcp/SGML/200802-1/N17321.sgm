<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL WORK.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Author of this work more than twenty years were wa&s;ted in learning, teaching, and diligently &s;cruti|nizing every part of medicine. The fir&s;t five pa&s;t away in hearing others, &s;tudying what he had heard, implicitly be|lieving it, and entering upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as a rich and va|luable inhertance. <HI>His mode of employment</HI> the next five years, was to explain more clearly the &s;everal particulars, to refine and give them a nicer poli&s;h. During the next equal &s;pace of time, becau&s;e no part of it had &s;ucceeded to his mind, he became cold upon the &s;ubject, and, with ma|ny eminent men, <HI>even</HI> with the vulgar them&s;elves, to de|plore the healing art as altogether uncertain and incompre|hen&s;ible. <HI>All this time pa&s;&s;ed away</HI> without <HI>the acqui&s;ition of</HI> any advantage, and of that, which of <HI>all</HI> things is the mo&s;t agreeable to the mind, the light of truth; and &s;o great, &s;o precious, a portion of the fading and &s;hort-lived age of man was lo&s;t. It was only betwixt the fifteenth and twentieth year <HI>of his &s;tudies,</HI> that, like a traveller in an unknown country, wandering in the &s;hade of night, after lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing eve|ry trace of his road, a very ob&s;cure gleam of light, like that of the fir&s;t break of day, dawned upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="022373_0003_0FB86CFE7919BCA0">
Thirteen years ago<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Four years mu&s;t be added now, it being that time &s;ince the &s;econd volume of the Elementa was publi&s;hed, that is, &s;eventeen years &s;ince the author's fir&s;t fit of the gout. At this very time from hard walking in very hot weather, to in&s;pect the beauties and maje&s;ty of Hampton-Court, he had a &s;light attack, which gave him no &s;ort of trouble, never hinder|ed him from bu&s;ine&s;s, and which he repelled in le&s;s than thirty-&s;ix hours.</NOTE>, when he was going in the thirty-&s;ixth year of his age, he fell into his fir&s;t fit of the gout. For many years before he had lived well, with the excep|tion of having confined him&s;elf to a diet more &s;paring than u&s;ual a few months before the arrival of the di&s;ea&s;e<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">It was about &s;ix months.</NOTE>. In about &s;ix weeks the di&s;ea&s;e fini&s;hed its cour&s;e, and did not return till &s;ix years after, and not even then, but in con&s;e|quence of unu&s;ual low living for &s;everal months<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Between five and &s;ix.</NOTE>. He was in the vigour of his age, and, excepting the taint of the gout, and &s;ome debility, brought on by his unu&s;ual ab&s;ti|nence, his habit was good. The di&s;ea&s;e, according to an old theory among phy&s;icians, was &s;aid to depend upon ple|thora and exce&s;&s;ive vigour; vegetable aliment was enjoin|ed, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ne was forbidden, and the careful execution of <HI>that plan of cure</HI> was promi&s;ed to be rewarded with no return of the di&s;ea&s;e. A whole year pa&s;t in a &s;trict adherence to this regimen. In the cour&s;e of that &s;pace of time, <HI>in&s;tead of never having a return of the di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> he experienced no le&s;s than four fits, mo&s;t violent, mo&s;t painful, and of a very great duration: <HI>In &s;hort,</HI> the whole year, except fourteen days, was divided between limping and excruciating pain.</P>
<P>If an over-proportion of blood and exce&s;s of vigour was the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, <HI>according to the general theory ju&s;t now mentioned,</HI> it became next with him a &s;ubject of enquiry, how &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms were to be explained; his reflections were, why the di&s;ea&s;e had not made its <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ap|pearance
<PB N="iii" REF="022373_0004_0FB86D03CD44B2B0">
twelve or fifteen years before, <HI>at a time</HI> when there was <HI>in reality</HI> more blood and vigour in the &s;y&s;tem<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">The blood is made from the food, and is in proportion to the quantity, quality, and completene&s;s of its dige&s;tion. Now, before each of his la&s;t fits for the time &s;pecified in the text, as well as during the whole cour&s;e of the attacks of the &s;econd year, his food had been almo&s;t &s;olely vegetable, and, therefore, was not &s;uited to produce enough, much le&s;s an exce&s;&s;ive quantity, of blood, and the dige&s;tion was al&s;o more imperfect.</NOTE>, and why it only came on after an abatement of diet both con&s;i|derable in degree and duration; why &s;o great an interval of time, during which he had returned to his u&s;ual full di|et, had intervened betwixt the fir&s;t fit and the recent ones; and, why the di&s;ea&s;e had twice, almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, come on after the change of <HI>full nouri&s;hing</HI> diet into a &s;pa|ring one. At la&s;t the &s;olution of this que&s;tion was made out by the interpo&s;ition of one of greater magnitude, in the following interrogatories: What is the effect of food, drink, and &s;imilar &s;upports of life? They produce &s;trength. What is their effect afterwards? Always le&s;s and le&s;s. What is it towards the end of life? They are &s;o far from giving any more &s;trength, that they evidently prove weak|ening. Nay, the very &s;ame powers, by which life was at fir&s;t &s;upported, at la&s;t put an end to it, commonly through the intervention of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>As di&s;ea&s;es fir&s;t, and death after, in general happen in the way <HI>that has been ju&s;t now</HI> explained, not from want, but an over-abundance of the &s;upports of life, he found, however, that the cau&s;e was debility, and &s;aw that it was not debilitating<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">according to the common practice of evacuation and &s;tarving;</NOTE>, but &s;trengthening, powers that were to be thought upon as remedies. To this &s;ort of debility he thought proper to give the name of indirect. Such for
<PB N="iv" REF="022373_0005_0FB86D054E5B2FA8">
two years was the &s;ucce&s;s of his invigorating plan<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">which he immediately after the la&s;t mentioned reflections and queries carried into execution;</NOTE>, that at the end of that <HI>&s;pace of time</HI> he only underwent a a very &s;light fit, which did not amount to a fourth part of any of the former ones<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">the fit that happened at the thirty-&s;ixth year of his age, and the four &s;evere ones, that attacked him about &s;ix years after, all within the cour&s;e of the &s;ame year.</NOTE>. Now, no phy&s;ician will deny, that the recurrence of &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e <HI>as the gout,</HI> which had made four attacks in one year, would have been more fre|quent than in that proportion the next two years, had the &s;ame method of cure been continued; nor will any one think the addition of two fits every year too much. The mild fit was four times le&s;s in degree than the more violent ones. Multiply, therefore, twelve by four, and, accord|ing to that computation, the proportion of alleviation of the di&s;ea&s;e will amount to a reduction of eight and forty to one. As, during the fir&s;t year, he made u&s;e of vegetable food alone, &s;o, during the&s;e two years, his only food was of the land animal kind, and of the mo&s;t nutrient quality. <HI>Of the latter,</HI> his choice was directed to the be&s;t in kind, <HI>without any other precaution than</HI> being &s;paring in the quan|tity he u&s;ed<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">He found mo&s;t kinds of fi&s;h, whether from the &s;ea or fre&s;h water, nearly as debilitating as vegetable matter, when &s;olely or chiefly relied upon for a meal.</NOTE>. A young gentleman, who lived with him and had laboured under a very &s;evere a&s;thma, in con&s;e|quenee of <HI>&s;ubmitting to the &s;ame</HI> treatment, &s;uffered only one fit at the end of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> two years, in&s;tead of <HI>experien|cing</HI> one every day, <HI>as he had done upon the common treatment.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards, to remove an opinion, that had been often in&s;i&s;ted on, of the gout not depending upon debility, be|cau&s;e inflammation accompanied it; little doubting that
<PB N="v" REF="022373_0006_0FB86D06C0DEF620">
the inflammation it&s;elf depended on debility, he &s;ubjected the que&s;tion to experiment. He invited &s;ome friends to dinner, and by the u&s;e of certain &s;timulants u&s;ed in their pre&s;ence<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are mentioned in Dr. Jones's Enquiry.</NOTE>, recovered the mo&s;t perfect u&s;e of that foot, with which, before dinner, he could not touch the floor for pain. By this <HI>fact</HI> he &s;aw, that <HI>not only the gout it&s;elf,</HI> but the inflammation accompanying it, was a&s;thenic<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">that is, depending on debility.</NOTE>. And he found, afterwards, &s;uch inflammations affecting the throat in the putrid, in the gangrenous &s;ore throat, and the joints in rheumatalgia, or that rheumati&s;m which depends upon debility, and is improperly denominated chronic rheumati&s;m<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">The word rheumati&s;m, as implying a &s;imilarity of the di&s;ea&s;e to the true acute rheumati&s;m, &s;hould be rejected, and this term, taken from Sauvage, &s;ub&s;tituted in its place.</NOTE>, and &s;uppo&s;ed, if there be any truth in that &s;uppo&s;ition to attack the brain in the end of typhus, to be al&s;o a&s;thenic.</P>
<P>As the gout affects the alimentary canal, and e&s;pecially the &s;tomach, and proceeds in its cour&s;e with di&s;tre&s;&s;ing cir|cum&s;tances &s;imilar to tho&s;e <HI>that happen</HI> in dy&s;pep&s;ia<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">or indige&s;tion;</NOTE>; being de&s;irous to know if there was any affinity betwixt it and them, he ob&s;erved that they, as well as it, depended on debility, and yielded to &s;timulant remedies. Nay, he afterwards found for certain, that all the &s;pa&s;modic, all the convul&s;ive, di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ame canal<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">or, fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, comprehending the pa&s;&s;age to the &s;tomach, that organ it&s;elf, and the inte&s;tines below it;</NOTE>, and nearly all the di&s;ea&s;es of children, were of the &s;ame &s;tamp.</P>
<P>Continuing his inve&s;tigation of the &s;ame &s;pa&s;modic and convul&s;ive di&s;ea&s;es, when they occupy the organs of vo|luntary motion; he di&s;covered that their nature was al|&s;o
<PB N="vi" REF="022373_0007_0FB86D08390273B0">
the &s;ame <HI>in kind,</HI> but <HI>only</HI> greater in degree; as <HI>they are exemplified</HI> in the &s;pa&s;ms and pains, <HI>that occur</HI> in various parts of the external <HI>&s;urface</HI> of the body, and in epilep&s;y<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">or the falling &s;ickne&s;s,</NOTE>, and in tetanus them&s;elves. And by that means he di&s;cerned, that a va&s;t number of affections, in which, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being inflammatory, no limits had been &s;et to the u&s;e of the lancet, <HI>in&s;tead of ari|&s;ing from an over-proportion of blood and exce&s;&s;ive vigour, or any other &s;uch cau&s;e,</HI> depended upon an under-proportion <HI>of that fluid,</HI> and other cau&s;es of debility, and were to be cured, not by bleeding, nor any other evacuations<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">&s;uch as vomiting, purging, &s;weating, bli&s;tering, gli&s;tering, &amp;c.</NOTE>, but by fill|ing <HI>the ve&s;&s;els,</HI> and re&s;toring the &s;trength <HI>of the whole &s;y&s;tem.</HI></P>
<P>At fir&s;t, for the purpo&s;e of removing fits of the gout, he went no farther than the u&s;e of wine, and other &s;trong drink, of <HI>a</HI> &s;imilar <HI>operation,</HI> and nouri&s;hing food, that is &s;ea&s;oned meat, and kept the u&s;e of the more powerful re|medies in re&s;erve. But, of late<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">that is, now, for many years pa&s;t.</NOTE>, his &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s in the u&s;e of the latter, has enabled him to find in opium, and certain other &s;timuli, the &s;ecret of repelling the fits of the gout as often as they returned, and, at the &s;ame time, re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound healthy &s;tate, a &s;ecret that has hi|therto been &s;o much wanted and de&s;paired of. This he has often effected both in him&s;elf and in other per&s;ons. It is now going the third year, and near the end of it<NOTE N="(&s;)" PLACE="foot">now the &s;eventh,</NOTE>, &s;ince he has <HI>always</HI> been able to prevent all return of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Taught by &s;imilar in&s;tances of actual practice, he found for certain that bleeding di&s;charges, which are called hae|morrhages, do not depend on plethora and vigour, but upon penury of blood and debility ari&s;ing from any other
<PB N="vii" REF="022373_0008_0FB86D0E6B3376A8">
&s;ource, and therefore did he reject them from the number of &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Sthenic di&s;ea&s;es, as will be afterwards explained, are &s;uch as de|pend upon an exce&s;&s;ive application of the &s;everal powers that otherwi&s;e produce health.</NOTE>, among which they had been arran|ged in the fir&s;t edition of the text book, re&s;erving a place for them among the a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es in the &s;econd volume of that work. For he &s;aw, that bleeding, various <HI>other</HI> evacuations, ab&s;tinence, cold, and &s;edatives, as they are called, proved hurtful; and that the &s;timulant plan of cure alone, was &s;alutary. Even wine and brandy, which had been thought &s;o hurtful <HI>in tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> he found the mo&s;t powerful of all other remedies in removing them. Upon finding that a certain fact; he learned, that in all the di&s;|ea&s;es, in which others had thought there was abundance of blood, there was a deficiency of it, and that from the defect of that and of other &s;timulants the <HI>real</HI> cau&s;e of <HI>the di&s;ea&s;es</HI> was debility; and &s;timulants, given in proportion to the degree of the cau&s;e, the <HI>proper</HI> remedies.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the light that thus beamed in from the practice, he found, that the cau&s;e and cure of fevers, both intermittent and continued, was the &s;ame as tho&s;e already mentioned.</P>
<P>Gradually led, as it were by the hand of nature, around the whole circle of a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">di&s;ea&s;es of debility.</NOTE>, he thoroughly per|ceived, that they all depended upon the &s;ame cau&s;e, that is, debility, that they were all to be removed by the &s;ame kind of remedies, to wit, &s;timulant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"><NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Wherever the word &s;timulant is u&s;ed without a particular quali|fication of its degree, the degree is under&s;tood to be greater then that required in the healthy &s;tate, as will afterwards more fully be ex|plained.</NOTE>, and that neither their cau&s;e nor their cure differed but in degree.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="022373_0009_0FB86D10D9141EC8">
With re&s;pect to &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, the nature of either the cau&s;e or cure of which nobody had ob&s;erved; he had long ago under&s;tood that inflammation in them, as well as the other &s;ymptoms, were not, as had been univer&s;ally believed by Sy&s;tematics, the cau&s;e, but the effect: and that the inflammation aro&s;e from the cau&s;e, i. e. the diathe&s;is<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">or habit.</NOTE>, and not even from it, unle&s;s very violent. In fine, he experienced in his own per&s;on, that catarrh was not produced by cold according to the common opinion, but by heat, and the other known &s;timuli, and was removed by cold and other debilitating powers. By which di&s;cove|ry he was led to form a proper judgment of the catarrhal &s;ymptoms in the mea&s;les: In which he found, that a very great man who had improved the cure of &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, but never attained to any knowledge of the a&s;thenic, had been mi&s;led, by the alexipharmic phy&s;icians. And, as the&s;e &s;ymptoms are the mo&s;t dangerous part of the di&s;ea&s;e, he was right in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the proper cure of them very much intere&s;ted that of the whole di&s;ea&s;e. The con&s;e|quence of which was that it came out a demon&s;trated fact, that the refrigerating antiphlogi&s;tic plan of cure was of e|qual &s;ervice in the mea&s;les and &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>In &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es he illu&s;trated the cau&s;e, enlarged the plan of cure, enriched the knowledge of both, explained and reduced the whole to a certain principle; he di&s;tributed all general di&s;ea&s;es into two forms, a &s;thenic and an a&s;thenic one<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Sthenic &s;ignifies an exce&s;s, a&s;thenic a defect, of invigorating power.</NOTE>. He demon&s;trated that the former depended upon exce&s;s, the latter upon deficiency of exciting power; that the former were to be removed by debilitating, the latter by &s;timulant, remedies; that the hurtful powers which excited either were the remedies of the other, and the con|trary;
<PB N="ix" REF="022373_0010_0FB86D1202AF87D0">
and that they acted by the &s;ame operation with the powers which produce the mo&s;t perfect health, differing from them only in degree. He extended the &s;ame doctrine to plants. He laid down a principle which is illu&s;trated and confirmed by all the parts of the detail, and <HI>it&s;elf</HI> reflects illu&s;tration and confirmation upon every one of them. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> he put the que&s;tion, whether the medical art, hi|therto conjectural, incoherent, and in the great body of it fal&s;e, was not at la&s;t, reduced to a demon&s;trated &s;cience, which might be called the &s;cience of life<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">That que&s;tion has been an&s;wered in the affirmative by every one who had been at due pains to under&s;tand the doctrine.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE TRANSLATION.</HEAD>
<P>A PRESSING, and very general, demand for an En|gli&s;h tran&s;lation of the Elementa Medicinae, made &s;eve|ral years before the publication of the &s;econd edition of that work, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively repeated with an encrea&s;ing importunity ever &s;ince; a de&s;ire of &s;preading the know|ledge of a doctrine, which had exhibited &s;o many indubi|table proofs of its importance and utility to mankind: an ambition, not quite extingui&s;hed by advancing years, do|me&s;tic cares, and a declining &s;tate of health, to get the better of the keene&s;t, and mo&s;t univer&s;al, per&s;ecution, that ever was rai&s;ed again&s;t an u&s;eful and exten&s;ive di&s;co|very; the nece&s;&s;ity for a tran&s;lation in the pre&s;ent decaying &s;tate of the knowledge of the Latin language; the dan|ger of the doctrine coming before the public from adventu|rers unequal to the ta&s;k; and &s;ome other circum&s;tances, partly of a private, partly of a dome&s;tic, nature, with which it would be impertinent to trouble the reader; all the&s;e at la&s;t prevailed with the author to &s;ubmit, for once, to a ta&s;k, otherwi&s;e not de&s;irable, that of tran&s;lating his own work. Such a ta&s;k &s;eemed more naturally calcula|ted to lay the foundation of the commencing &s;ame of an in|genious pupil. But, as no one of many, who&s;e literature
<PB N="xii" REF="022373_0012_0FB86D14F9A88368">
and knowledge of the &s;ubject completely qualified them for the undertaking, wi&s;hed to &s;uper&s;ede the occa&s;ion for his engaging in it him&s;elf; and as the courage of &s;eve|ral per&s;ons of a different de&s;cription kept not pace with their affectation or intere&s;tedne&s;s; it is to be hoped the public will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to receive the work from the author him&s;elf. This performance is intended for the u&s;e of three &s;ets of readers; tho&s;e who do not readily enter into a thought conveyed in pure Latin, and who, there|fore, might wi&s;h to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a tran&s;lation for the &s;ake of comparing it with the original, and, thereby, of acquiring, renewing, or improving their knowledge of the latter; tho&s;e, who are only acquainted with &s;uch Latin, as has prevailed in modern times; and, la&s;tly, tho&s;e, who either cannot, or will not be &s;ubjected to the trouble of reading Latin at all, and who, &s;urely, may, often be better employed.</P>
<P>Both this, and the original work, are intended not for the exclu&s;ive u&s;e of medical readers, but al&s;o for that of the public at large, it being evident, that, without e|ven the exception of the profe&s;&s;ional knowledge of each individual, that of his own health is preferable to all others. And &s;uch ana <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">qui&s;ition becomes valuable in pro|portion to its ju&s;tne&s;s and &s;olidity. The public are pre|&s;ented with a work, that claims the merit of having redu|ced the doctrine and practice of medicine to &s;cientific cer|tainty and exactne&s;s. With re&s;pect to the form, in which it is delivered, it is &s;tripped of that jargon of numerous, unmeaning or mi&s;leading terms, and all that my&s;tery ei|ther in &s;tyle or matter, that has hitherto rendered the pre|tended healing art impenetrable to the mo&s;t intelligent and di&s;cerning, and locked it fa&s;t up in the &s;chools. No terms are admitted but the few that nece&s;&s;ity impo&s;ed, and the&s;e are every where defined. The &s;tyle is &s;imple, and
<PB N="xiii" REF="022373_0013_0FB86D1B25A607F0">
&s;uited to the &s;implicity of the &s;ubject. In the language and compo&s;ition, as far as the thoughts, which are new throughout, and that re&s;traint, which is in&s;eparable from exactne&s;s of tran&s;lation, permit, clearne&s;s is every where preferred to elegance, and diffu&s;ion to brevity.</P>
<P>The author, in prefixing his name to both forms of his work, has thrown the gauntlet to its numerous, but anony|mous, oppo&s;ers. They are, therefore, called upon, now or never, to di&s;prove it, and the judicious and candid part of mankind to judge between the parties.</P>

<P>X. IN all the &s;tates of life, man and other animals differ from them&s;elves in their dead &s;tate, or from any o|ther inanimate matter in this property alone; that they can be affected by external agents, as well as by certain functions peculiar to them&s;elves, in &s;uch a manner, that the phaenomena peculiar to their living &s;tate, that is, their own functions, can be produced. This propo&s;ition comprehends every thing that is vital in nature, and there|fore, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> applies to vegetables.</P>
<P>XI. The external agents in general, are reducible to heat, diet,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Con&s;i&s;ting of food, drink, and condiment.</NOTE>, other matters taken into the &s;tomach, the blood, the fluids &s;ecreted from the blood, and air. <HI>How</HI>

<P>XII. The functions of the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf, producing the &s;ame effect, are mu&s;cular contraction, &s;en&s;e, and the ener|gy of the brain in thinking, and in exciting pa&s;&s;ion and emotion. "While the&s;e affect the &s;y&s;tem in the &s;ame manner as the other agents; &s;o, with re&s;pect to their ori|gin, they ari&s;e both from the other and from them|&s;elves."</P>
<P>XIII. The re&s;ult of withholding either the property di&s;tingui&s;hing living from dead matter, or the operation of either of the two &s;ets of powers, is the non-exi&s;tence of life. Nothing el&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to life.</P>
<P>XIV. The property, by which both &s;ets <HI>of powers</HI> act, &s;hould be named Excitability; and the powers them&s;elves, Exciting powers. By the word "body" is meant both the body &s;imply &s;o called, and al&s;o as endued with an in|tellectual part, a part appropriated to pa&s;&s;ion and emotion, or to the &s;oul; the appellation commonly given to it <HI>in medical writings</HI> is &s;y&s;tem<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">No di&s;qui&s;ition is here meant to be entered into, as religion is no where interfered with, but left to its proper guardians.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>XV. The common effect, produced by the exciting powers, is &s;en&s;e, motion, mental action, and the pa&s;&s;ions. Which effect being one and the &s;ame, it mu&s;t, therefore, be granted, that the operation of all the powers is al&s;o one and the &s;ame<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">That is, &s;ince &s;en&s;e, motion, mental functions, and the pa&s;&s;ions are the only, and a con&s;tant, effect of the exciting powers, acting upon the excitability; and &s;ince that happens, whether one, or more, or all the powers, or which &s;oever of them, act, the irre&s;i&s;table conclu&s;ion, that ari&s;es in the mind, is, that the effect of the powers being the &s;ame, the mode of operation of them al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t be the &s;ame.

<P>XVIII. WE know not what excitability is, or in what manner it is affected by the exciting powers. But, whatever it be, either a certain quantity, or a certain ener|gy of it, is a&s;&s;igned to every being upon the commence|ment of its living &s;tate. The quantity, or energy, is dif|ferent in different animals, and in the &s;ame animal at dif|ferent times. It is partly owing to the uncertain nature of the &s;ubject, partly to the poverty of common language, and likewi&s;e to the novelty of this doctrine, that the phra|&s;es of the excitability being abundant, encrea&s;ed, accumu|lated, &s;uperfluous; or weak, not well enough &s;u&s;tained, not well enough exerci&s;ed, or deficient in energy, when

enough of &s;timulus has not been applied; &s;ometimes ti|red, fatigued, worn out, languid, exhau&s;ted or con&s;umed, when the &s;timulus has operated in a violent degree; or be|ing at other times in vigour, or reduced to one half, when the &s;timulus has neither been applied in exce&s;s nor defect, will be employed in different parts of this en&s;uing work. Both upon this, and every other &s;ubject we mu&s;t abide by facts; and carefully avoid the &s;lippery que&s;tion about cau|&s;es, as being in general incomprehen&s;ible, and as having ever proved a venomous &s;nake to philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>XIX. As there is always &s;ome excitability, however &s;mall, while life remains, and the action of the exciting powers in one degree or another is never wanting; the conclu&s;ion from that <HI>fact</HI> is, that they are all endowed with more or le&s;s of &s;timulant power, and that this mu&s;t be either exce&s;&s;ive, in due proportion, or deficient. A great quantity of blood &s;timulates in exce&s;s, and, there|fore, produces the di&s;ea&s;es that depend upon too much &s;timulus; but an under proportion of blood, though de|bilitating <HI>in its effect,</HI> and inducing the di&s;ea&s;es that de|pend upon debility as their cau&s;e, mu&s;t &s;till be under&s;tood to be &s;timulant; but only &s;o much more weakly &s;timulant, as the penury is more con&s;iderable: The &s;ame conclu&s;ion applies to all the other exciting powers, unle&s;s that poi|&s;ons, contagions, and &s;ome few other powers, might to &s;ome &s;eem exceptions. But,</P>
<P>XX. Poi&s;ons either do not produce the univer&s;al di&s;|ea&s;es, which make our pre&s;ent &s;ubject; or, if they do, by operating the &s;ame effect as the ordinary exciting powers, their mode of operation mu&s;t al&s;o be allowed to be the &s;ame<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This propo&s;ition of frequent occurrence in this work, that iden|tity of known effect, always produces identity of cau&s;e though un|known, will be found to be a mode of rea&s;oning of equal &s;ervice in guarding our reader from the deceitfulne&s;s of ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, and in leading him into a proper mode of inve&s;tigating &s;olid and u&s;eful truth.</NOTE>.</P>

If both the&s;e are the product, not of contagi|on alone, but, by a conjoint operation, al&s;o of the hurtful powers that u&s;ually depend upon &s;timulus, which is a fact a&s;certained: the effect, therefore, in this ca&s;e being the &s;ame, the conclu&s;ion is unavoidable, that their cau&s;e is al&s;o the &s;ame, and the mode of operation of both the &s;ame. It mu&s;t, therefore, be admitted that the operation of contagions is &s;timulant<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">This is all that is contended for at pre&s;ent; the degree of their &s;ti|mulus will be afterwards con&s;idered.</NOTE>.

Finally, the great debilitating energy, <HI>ob&s;er|vable</HI> in certain contagions, does not more prove a diver|&s;ity of action <HI>in them,</HI> than <HI>it d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es</HI> in <HI>the ca&s;e of</HI> an equal or greater degree of debility, ari&s;ing from cold<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">At the freezing point, or below it, man, and &s;imilar animals of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rm blood, could not live a &s;econd in a den&s;e medium, &s;uch as that of water; but the animals of cold blood can.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&dgr;.

<P>&egr;. In general all vegetable matter, when depended upon alone for nouri&s;hment, is hurtful, at lea&s;t, to tho&s;e who
<PB N="7" REF="022373_0021_0FB86D2C9D50B708">
have been accu&s;tomed to better, and that by a debilitating operation; and yet even it, &s;ince it &s;upports life, however incommodiou&s;ly, longer than <HI>a total</HI> want of food, mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be &s;timulant. But, if a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e from vegetable food, and not, to a certain degree, from want; that circum&s;tance mu&s;t be owing to a certain change pro|duced in the &s;y&s;tem, by which the &s;um total of &s;timuli is rendered le&s;s fit to act upon the excitability. That &s;uch is the ca&s;e, is proved by the mo&s;t &s;timulant matter of food lo&s;ing part of its &s;timulus by continued u&s;e, and requiring the &s;ub&s;titution of another in its place.</P>
<P>&zgr;. In the &s;ame manner is the operation of emetics and purgatives to be explained, as dimini&s;hing the &s;um total of excitement; which depends partly on an agreeable relation <HI>that the exciting power hears</HI> to the excitability, or on an agreeable &s;en&s;ation. That it is &s;ometimes the relation, &s;ometimes the &s;en&s;ation, that acts <HI>in this ca&s;e,</HI> is evident from the hurtful effect of things mo&s;t grateful to the &s;en&s;e, as in the examples of the legumina, and other articles of vegetable food; and by the &s;alutary effect of di&s;agreeable things, as the &s;everal forms and preparations of opium: Both which produce their effect, the former by a debilita|ting, that is, an in&s;ufficiently &s;timulant, the latter by a con&s;iderably &s;timulant, operation<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Suppo&s;e a certain power, as 40, to mark the degree, in which the &s;um total of proper &s;timulant operation con&s;i&s;ts, and the excitement, produced to that degree, to ari&s;e from different exciting powers, all of them conducing to the &s;ame effect, by the operation of each bearing an agreeable relation to the excitability, or producing an agreeable &s;en&s;a|tion on it; the inference to be drawn from that fact is, that a certain &s;uitablene&s;s in the mixture of the whole to the excitability, as well as the degree of &s;timulus, produces the effect. Again, &s;uppo&s;e certain in|gredients, which cannot be denied to be &s;timulant, added to this given mixture, the effect of the added article will be one of two: it will either increa&s;e the excitement fir&s;t produced, without altering the agreeable &s;tate which that had induced; or it will, &s;till without any rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing it not &s;timulant, dimini&s;h the excitement that had ari&s;en from the combination of the agreeable articles. And this will happen merely from the effect of a di&s;cordant combination of exciting powers, while that, which dimini&s;hes the exciting effect of the others, as well as the&s;e others, that con&s;tituted its given &s;um, are both &s;timulant; but the for|mer in a higher, the latter in a lower degree&punc; and therefore acting over all as debilitating powers. Mu&s;tard taken with meat, or onions with beef-&s;takes, are agreeable to mo&s;t ta&s;tes; but they are, though &s;till &s;timu|lant, di&s;agreeable to others, and debilitating. Peas-&s;oup and peas-pud|ding, though, independent of the animal juice infu&s;ed into them, they are far from being &s;alutary, will be bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e by many; while in others, e&s;|pecially tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to more &s;timulant meals, and in per&s;ons who are gouty, and liable to complaints of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, they will produce morbid affection. The &s;ame thing is to be &s;aid of beef-&s;teaks with onions, which agree with the &s;ound &s;tate, and di&s;agree with that of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages ju&s;t now mentioned. With regard to all the&s;e enfeebling matters, there is no que&s;tion about their being &s;timu|lant; the whole effect is to be referred to their rendering a mixture, &s;timulant in a certain degree, le&s;s &s;o.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="022373_0022_0FB86D2DC5BE90D8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. The &s;edative affections, as they are called, are only a le&s;&s;er degree of the exciting ones. Thus fear and grief are only diminutions<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Not pa&s;&s;ions different in kind.</NOTE>, or lower degrees, of confidence and joy. The news of money gained produces joy, and grief <HI>ari&s;es from</HI> the lo&s;s of it. Here then no operation of a nature contrary to &s;timulant takes place; it is nothing but a diminution, or inferior degree, of &s;timulant opera|tion. The &s;ubject of the pa&s;&s;ions admits of the &s;ame rea|&s;oning in every re&s;pect as that of heat<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">The doctrine of cold as an active power, and, oppo&s;ite to heat, is now aniver&s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y rejected, and con&s;idered as only a diminution of heat.</NOTE>; and in the the &s;ame manner all the bodies <HI>in nature,</HI> that &s;eem to be &s;edative, are debilitating, that is, weakly &s;timulant; ow|ing their debility to a degree of &s;timulus greatly inferior to the proper one.</P>
<P>XXII. Since the general powers produce all the phae|nomena of life, and the only operation, by which they
<PB N="9" REF="022373_0023_0FB86D2F39981C30">
do &s;o, is &s;timulant; it, therefore, follows, that the whole phaenomena of life, every &s;tate and degree of health and di&s;ea&s;e, al&s;o con&s;i&s;t in &s;timulus, and are owing to no other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>XXIII. Excitement, the effect of the exciting powers, the true cau&s;e of life, is, within certain boundaries, produced in a degree proportioned to the degree of &s;timu|lus. The degree of &s;timulus, when moderate<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Of a middle kind.</NOTE>, produ|ces health; in a higher degree it gives occa&s;ion to di&s;ea&s;es of exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus; in a lower degree, or ultimately low, it induces tho&s;e that depend upon a deficiency of &s;timulus, or debility. And, as what has been men|tioned, is the cau&s;e both of di&s;ea&s;es and perfect health; &s;o that which re&s;tores the morbid to the healthy &s;tate, is a di|minution of excitement in <HI>the ca&s;e of</HI> di&s;ea&s;es of exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus, and an encrea&s;e <HI>of the &s;ame excitement</HI> for the re|moval of di&s;ea&s;es of debility. Both which <HI>intentions</HI> are called Indications of Cure.</P>
<P>XXIV. This mutual relation obtains betwixt excitabi|lity and excitement, that the more weakly the powers have acted, or the le&s;s the &s;timulus has been, the more a|bundant the excitability becomes; the more powerful the &s;timulus of the agents has been, the excitability becomes the more exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>XXV. A mean &s;timulus, affecting al&s;o a mean or half con&s;umed excitability, produces the highe&s;t excitement. And the excitement becomes le&s;s and le&s;s, in proportion as either the &s;timulus is applied in a higher degree, or the excitability more accumulated. Hence the vigour of youth, and the weakne&s;s of childhood and old age. Hence, with|in a more moderate &s;pace of time, a middle diet <HI>gives</HI> vigour, and debility is the effect of its being either too full or too &s;paring.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="022373_0024_0FB86D348E7F0770">
XXVI. While that is the ca&s;e, every age, every habit, if the excitement be properly directed has its <HI>due degree</HI> of vigour <HI>accommodated to it.</HI> Childhood, and that weakne&s;s, which an abundant excitability produces, admits of little &s;timulus, <HI>but,</HI> upon le&s;s than the middle proportion becomes languid, upon more is oppre&s;&s;ed. Old age, and that frail|ty, which is occa&s;ioned by a deficiency of excitability, re|quires a great deal of &s;timulus, becomes enfeebled by le&s;s, and over&s;et by more. The rea&s;on for the latter is, that the excitability, without which no vital action is produ|ced, does not exi&s;t in that degree, by which vigour of the functions is produced; while the former is to be explained from the exciting or &s;timulant power, without which the excitability is of no effect, not being applied in that degree, which is requi&s;ite to the vigour that it &s;hould give. The impotency of &s;timulus may ri&s;e to &s;uch a degree, as to pro|duce death from its extreme under proportion. On the contrary, the exhau&s;tion of excitability may go &s;o far, as to extingui&s;h life by the extreme exce&s;s of &s;timulus.</P>
<P>XXVII. The circum&s;tances, under which excitement is produced, have two confining boundaries.</P>
<P>XXVIII. The one of the&s;e circum&s;tances is, ex|hau&s;tion of the excitability from violence of &s;timulus. For all the &s;timulant powers may carry their &s;timulant energy to that degree, under which no excitement will a|ri&s;e. The rea&s;on for which is, that the body becomes no longer fit to receive the operation of &s;timulus; another ex|pre&s;&s;ion for which is, that the excitability is con&s;umed.</P>
<P>XXIX. The termination<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Or ce&s;&s;ation, or extinction.</NOTE> of excitement, from the exhau&s;tion of the excitability by &s;timulus, may be either temporary or irreparable, and may ari&s;e either from a &s;hort continuance of a high degree of &s;timulus, or a long applica|tion of one the exce&s;s of which is more moderate. Both
<PB N="11" REF="022373_0025_0FB86D3818AA0A88">
circum&s;tances come to the &s;ame thing; the high degree of &s;timulus compen&s;ating for the &s;hortne&s;s of its application, and the &s;hortne&s;s of its application for its greater modera|tion in degree<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">A force of &s;timulus as &s;ix, operating for a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pace of time as one; and a force of &s;timulus as one, operating for a &s;pace of time as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix, will produce the &s;ame effect in wearing out the excitability.</NOTE>. The effect of the former is &s;udden death; of the latter a more gradual death preceded by di&s;ea&s;es. And though a mo&s;t exact mea&s;ure of excitement were kept up, yet death at la&s;t, however late, &s;upervenes.</P>
<P>XXX. Ebriety, debauch in eating and drinking, &s;weat, languor, heat either <HI>operating</HI> alone, or overcoming the effect of cold, dulne&s;s in mental exertion from exce&s;&s;ive thinking, or &s;inking of the &s;pirits in con&s;equence of vio|lence of pa&s;&s;ion, finally, &s;leep; all the&s;e are the con&s;e|quences of a &s;hort application of a high degree of &s;timulus, operating an exhau&s;tion of excitability. The long conti|nuance of a more moderate exce&s;s in the force of &s;timulus, is followed by the frailty of old age, predi&s;po&s;ition to di&s;|ea&s;es of debility, as well as tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es them&s;elves. The ultimate termination of both is death.</P>
<P>XXXI. When the excitability is wa&s;ted by any one &s;timulus, there is &s;till a re&s;erve of it, capable of being <HI>acted upon</HI> by any other.

<P>XXXV. The excitability, thus exhau&s;ted by &s;timulus is debility, which &s;hould be denominated indirect, becau&s;e it does not ari&s;e from defect, but exce&s;s of &s;timulus<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Like another debility, by and by to be &s;poken of.</NOTE></P>

If cold &s;ometimes &s;eems to &s;timulate, it produces that effect, not as actual cold, but either by dimini&s;hing exce&s;&s;ive heat, and reducing it to its proper &s;timulant tem|perature<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">The principle upon which the operation of the cold bath depends has never been under&s;tood, and therefore all rea&s;oning, as well as prac|tice, with re&s;pect to it, has been conducted in quite a vague and random manner.

The truth is, that, in that country, there is no acce&s;s to the u&s;e of actual cold.

An in|&s;tance of this operation of cold occurs in the Torrid Zone, where actual cold is &s;carcely to be procured, in the u&s;e of refrigerants, as they are called, in fevers, and in the con|traction, by means of cold, of a &s;crotum previou&s;ly re|laxed by heat.

<P>XXXVIII. The other condition <HI>or circum&s;tance,</HI> limi|ting excitement, is, an energy of the exciting powers too &s;mall, and therefore in&s;ufficient to produce excitement.

<P>XXXIX. In this ca&s;e, the excitability is abundant, be|cau&s;e, in con&s;equence of the &s;timuli being withheld, it is not exhau&s;ted. Thus, in the cold bath, the excitement is dimini&s;hed, becau&s;e the &s;timulus of heat, and, therefore, the &s;um of all the &s;timuli, is deficient; and the excita|bility, as being le&s;s exhau&s;ted by &s;timulus, is encrea&s;ed<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"><P>This is altogether a negative circum&s;tance. The accumulation, encrea&s;e, or abundance or excitability, take any term you plea&s;e, is not occa&s;ioned by any action or operation, but by the want of action, the want of operation. To form an adequate idea of it, &s;uppo&s;e a &s;cale of excitability of 80 degrees, as in the line here drawn.</P>
<P>EXCITING POWER.</P>
<P>0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80</P>
<P>EXCITABILITY.</P>
<P>80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0</P>
<P>At the commencement of life, the &s;um total a&s;&s;igned is under&s;tood to be 80, becau&s;e no part, as yet, is wa&s;ted by the action of &s;timuli. Next it is wa&s;ted in proportion as the&s;e are applied from the beginning to the end of the &s;cale. Its wa&s;ting is, therefore, owing to action and opera|tion, but its accumulation to the rever&s;e, the want of the action or ope|ration of the exciting powers, as is expre&s;&s;ed by the numbers placed a|bove tho&s;e fir&s;t mentioned. Thus one degree of exciting power applied takes off one degree of excitability, and every &s;ub&s;equent degree im|pairs the excitability in a proportion exactly equal to its degree of force. Thus a degree of &s;timulant or exciting power equal to 10, reduces the excitability to 70; 20 to 60; 30 to 50; 40 to 40; 50 to 30; 60 to 20; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0 to 10; 80 to 0. And on the contrary, the &s;ubtraction of &s;timu|lant power allows the excitability to accumulate. Thus, when the ex|citement is at 79, con&s;tituting only one degree of life, take off one de|gree of exciting power, and 2 degrees of excitability will ari&s;e. As 80 degrees of exciting power leave no excitability, &s;o 70 degrees of exciting power leave 10; 60 20; 50 30; 40 40; 30 50; 20 60; 10 70; 0 80. Hence death takes place from nothing po&s;itive, but from the negation of the only means by which life is &s;upported; which are the &s;everal exci|ting or &s;timulant powers, now fully explained.</P></NOTE>.

XL. As, during the encrea&s;e of excitability, the ex|citement decrea&s;es, and in proportion to the encrea&s;e of the former; &s;o that that proce&s;s may go all the way to death, is a fact from which nature exhibits no exception. It is confirmed by the effect of all the debilitating powers mentioned above; every individual of which, as often as it proves urgent, has a rapid tendency to death.</P>
<P>XLI. The defect of any one &s;timulus, and the pro|portional abundance of excitability, is, for the time, com|pen&s;ated by any other, and often with great advantage to the &s;y&s;tem. So a per&s;on, who has dined in&s;ufficiently, <HI>and therefore not well enough &s;timulated,</HI> is recruited by a piece of good news. Or, if during the cour&s;e of the day, he has not been &s;ufficiently invigorated by the &s;timulant operation of corporeal or mental exerci&s;e, and con&s;equently likely to pa&s;s a &s;leeple&s;s night, he will be laid a&s;leep by a do&s;e of &s;trong liquor. When the latter is not at hand, opium will &s;upply its place. The want of the venereal gratification is relieved by wine, and the want of the latter is made amends for by <HI>the u&s;e of</HI> the former, each bani&s;h|ing the languor occa&s;ioned by the want of the other. The &s;ame conclu&s;ion applies to the u&s;e of &s;timuli, for which we have an artificial, rather than a natural, craving. The longing for &s;nuff, when it cannot be got, is gratified by the practice of chewing tobacco; and, when any one is lan|guid for want of tobacco, &s;moaking &s;upplies the place of it. Nay, when the functions, as they often are, have un|dergone a temporary le&s;ion, and on account of that, there is no acce&s;s to the u&s;e of certain accu&s;tomary and natural &s;timuli; the &s;ub&s;titution of others, le&s;s accu&s;tomary, and le&s;s natural, &s;upports life, till the de&s;ire for the natural &s;ti|muli

<P>XLII. As, in this manner, the &s;uperabundance of ex|citability, proportioned to the deficiency of &s;timulus, may through all the degrees from its &s;malle&s;t to its greate&s;t quantity, be worn out to a certain extent, by one &s;timulus, and then another, and the danger <HI>of its morbid</HI> accumulati|on awarded, till the &s;um of it be brought down to that, which is &s;uitable to health; &s;o, the more abundant the <HI>&s;ame</HI> excitabilty is, that is the more &s;timuli are withdrawn, or the greater penury of the mo&s;t powerful &s;timuli is; the le&s;s recour&s;e can be had to that mediocrity of excitability on which the vigour of life depends; and the weakne&s;s may go to that pitch, the excitability arrive at that degree of abundance, that the <HI>lo&s;s of</HI> excitement may at la&s;t be|come irreparable.

<P>XLIII. This &s;uperabundant excitability proceeds with &s;uch rapidity to death, that the only means of re&s;toring health, is fir&s;t to encounter it with a very &s;mall <HI>do&s;e of</HI> dif|fu&s;ible &s;timulus, <HI>a do&s;e</HI> &s;carcely exceeding the &s;canty<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Or under-proportioned.</NOTE> por|portion of &s;timulus, that occa&s;ioned it; then, after wa&s;ting a part of the &s;uperabundance, to proceed to &s;omewhat a &s;tronger do&s;e <HI>of the &s;timulus;</HI> and in that manner to be con|&s;tantly taking off whatever &s;uperfluity &s;till remains, till at

<P>XLIV. Since all life con&s;i&s;ts in &s;timulus, and both the over-abundance and deficiency of it is productive of di&s;ea&s;es, and in <HI>exact</HI> proportion to the over-abundance or deficiency; it follows, that the remedies of both the&s;e deviations from the <HI>proper</HI> &s;tandard &s;hould be accommodated to their degree;

and that a high &s;um total of &s;timulus, through the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hould be applied to a high degree of debi|lity, or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, to a very abun|dant excitability; but, that the quantity to be applied at any <HI>particular</HI> time &s;hould be in the &s;ame proportion &s;mall that the excitability is abundant.</P>
<P>XLV. The debility ari&s;ing from defect of &s;timulus, merits the appellation of DIRECT; becau&s;e it happens in con&s;equence of no po&s;itive hurtful power, but from a &s;ub|duction of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upports of life.</P>
<P>XLVI. Through the whole cour&s;e of direct debility, e|very deficiency of &s;timulus is encrea&s;ed by a &s;econd, the &s;e|cond by a third, the third by a fourth, till the effect at la&s;t comes to be a ce&s;&s;ation of any further excitement. This la&s;t, therefore, is never to be le&s;&s;ened and the debility encrea&s;ed, with the view, for&s;ooth, that in con&s;equence of encrea&s;ing the excitability, the addition of a new &s;ti|mulus may act more &s;trongly. For, as often as that is put in practice, the morbid &s;tate is encrea&s;ed; and, if the debility &s;hould happen to be great, any <HI>further</HI> encrea&s;e of it may induce death, but <HI>never</HI> encrea&s;e the &s;trength. For, while great debility, and, indeed, at plea&s;ure, may, <HI>in that way,</HI> be produced; <HI>any</HI> excitement to be obtained from a &s;timulus to come after, is confined within narrow boundaries<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Suppo&s;e, that in place of an excitement of 40 degrees, the ex|citement is gone down to XXX, and the excitability mounted up to L, and a debilitating power, &s;uch as the cold bath, or any of tho&s;e that are ju&s;t now to be mentioned in the text, has been &s;uperadded, reducing the excitement to XXV, and accumulating the excitability to LV. Suppo&s;e al&s;o, that any &s;timulus is next employed, with a view to rai&s;e the excitement, and &s;ink or reduce the excitability; what will be the re|&s;ult? As an accumulated excitability admits of a very &s;mall degree of &s;timulus at any given time, while the accumulation of excitability, and &s;inking of excitement, even to death it&s;elf, can be effected in the &s;hort|e&s;t &s;pace of time, and by any one of the debilitating powers; con&s;e|quently, the lo&s;s of vigour by the fir&s;t practice, and the reparation of it by the la&s;t, will bear no proportion to one another; there will be no po&s;&s;ibility of regaining the vigour thrown away, much le&s;s any hope of procuring more than exi&s;ted before it was lowered.</NOTE>.

THE &s;eat of excitability in the living body<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Called &s;y&s;tem by medical writers.</NOTE>, is medullary nervous matter, and mu&s;cular &s;olid; to which the appellation of nervous &s;y&s;tem may be given. The excitability <HI>is</HI> inherent in it, <HI>but</HI> not different in different parts of its &s;eat. This fact is proved by the production of &s;en&s;e, motion, the mental function, and pa&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">That is, all the functions which di&s;tingui&s;h living animal &s;y|&s;tems.</NOTE>, im|mediately, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and not in a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive operation<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">If a &s;mall quantity of an opiate, a large one of any &s;trong &s;pirit, taken into the &s;tomach, can in&s;tantly alleviate an excruciating pain in a Part the mo&s;t di&s;tant from that to which the remedy is applied, and, in a &s;hort time after, remove it altogether, as is now well known, how is that to be explained but by the above propo&s;ition; it being impo&s;&s;ible to pretend that it is carried in the ve&s;&s;els? Nor is any other of the many hypothe&s;es, that have been thought of for the &s;olution of this fact, more admi&s;&s;ible. Should it be imagined, that it moves along the nerves ac|cording to the la&s;t opinion, we demand proof of that a&s;&s;ertion; which has not yet, and will not ea&s;ily be produced; while the fact ju&s;t now a&s;&s;igned carries its own demon&s;tration in its bo&s;om. The que&s;tion re|&s;olves it&s;elf wholely into the following &s;olution; Why does opium at once relieve the gout in the &s;tomach, on the external &s;urface, and in the remote&s;t extremity of that &s;urface? Becau&s;e the property in the living &s;y|&s;tem, upon which and by which it acts, is one and the &s;ame over all.</NOTE>.</P>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. Different exciting powers are applied to different parts of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, one at once to them all; but <HI>the mode</HI> of their application is &s;uch, that, wherever they are applied, every one immediately affects the whole excitability.</P>
<P>XLIX. Every one of the &s;ame powers always affects &s;ome part more than any other, <HI>in which re&s;pect</HI> one pow|er <HI>affects</HI> one part <HI>more than any other,</HI> another another, <HI>with the &s;ame</HI> inequality. The affected part is generally that to which any of the powers is directly applied.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. And be&s;ides that, the more excitability has been a&s;&s;igned to any part from the beginning <HI>of the living &s;tate,</HI> that is, the more vivid and &s;en&s;ible it is, the operation up|on it of each exciting power, whether acting with due force, or in exce&s;s, or in defect, and through all the interminate degrees <HI>of its action,</HI> becomes more powerful<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">That is to &s;ay, if the exciting power acts with that force which produces health, the degree of its action is greater upon the given than any other part; as al&s;o when its action is either greater or le&s;s than that of the middle &s;alutary degree.</NOTE>. Thus the brain and alimentary canal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more vivid exci|tability, that is, more propen&s;ity to life, than other inter|nal parts; and the parts below the nails, than other exter|nal parts. Again, while the fact ju&s;t now related is &s;uch, a sit has been &s;tated, the affection of the part bears no pro|portion to that diffu&s;ed over the whole body.</P>
<P>L. An e&s;timate may be formed of the degree of affecti|on in the part more affected <HI>than any other,</HI> and of that which is diffu&s;ed over the whole body, by comparing the affection of the former with as many le&s;&s;er affections, ta|ken together, as equal the number of parts in all the re&s;t of the body. Suppo&s;e the greater affection of a part<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">As the inflammation of the lungs in peripneumony, the inflam|mation of the foot in the gout, the effu&s;ion of water into a general or par|ticular cavity in drop&s;y.</NOTE>

to be as 6, and the le&s;&s;er affection of every other part to be 3&punc; and the number of the parts le&s;s affected to amount to 1000<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Which is keeping greatly within the truth.</NOTE>; then it <HI>will follow, that</HI> the ratio of affection, confined to the part, to the affection of all the re&s;t of the body, will be as 6 to 3000. This e&s;timate, or &s;omething very like to it, is proved by <HI>the effect of</HI> the exciting hurt|ful powers, which always act upon the whole body<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">The hurtful powers which produce peripneumony, in common English, the inflammation of the lungs, are exce&s;s in eating, drinking, expo&s;ure to heat, or to the alternation of heat with cold, an over pro|portion of blood from inactivity, or an encrea&s;ed velocity of its motion from violent labour, &amp;c. the effect of any or all which mu&s;t fall as much upon every other part of the &s;y&s;tem as upon a &s;mall portion of extreme ve&s;&s;els in the lungs, and therefore the morbid affection produced cannot be confined to the latter, but mu&s;t be extended to the former. The whole body mu&s;t partake of the morbid change; it mu&s;t be one common affection pervading the whole. If this is not probation, let any thing left on record by authors, or any living phy&s;ician, produce a &s;ingle hurt|ful power, that, without affecting the &s;y&s;tem over all, can penetrate in|to the the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the lungs, and there produce an inflamma|tion. I &s;hall be content with one &s;uch hurtful power, and in exchange for it, when produced, give up my whole doctrine.</NOTE>; and by <HI>that of</HI> the remedies, which always remove the effect of the hurtful powers from the whole body<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Here too I throw the gauntlet.

<P>LII. In&s;tances of a greater excitement of a part then <HI>of the re&s;t of the body,</HI> are found in &s;weat in a per&s;on in health, flowing fir&s;t from the brow under exerci&s;e, in checked per&s;piration, in inflammation or an affection analagous to it in di&s;ea&s;es, in head-ach and delirium.

<P>LIII. As the operation of the general powers, whether exciting in exce&s;s, in due proportion, or in defect, is di|rected to &s;ome one part a little more, than to any other equal part; <HI>it is next to be ob&s;erved,</HI> that it mu&s;t be of the &s;ame kind in that part as in the re&s;t, and as well as the general <HI>operation,</HI> be either in exce&s;s, or in ju&s;t pro|portion or deficient, but never of an oppo&s;ite <HI>nature.</HI> For as the exciting powers are the &s;ame, and the excitabi|lity every where the &s;ame, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the effect &s;hould not be the &s;ame. The excitement, therefore, is never encrea&s;ed in a part, while it is dimini&s;hed in the gene|ral &s;y&s;tem&mdash;nor dimini&s;hed, while the general excitement is encrea&s;ed.

Thus, nau&s;ea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and other &s;imilar &s;ymptoms, produced by &s;trong drink and opiates; as well as the &s;ame affections apparently, and the gout, colic, gripes, and other &s;imilar &s;ymptoms, occa&s;ioned by ab&s;tinence and water drin|king; likewi&s;e good appetite, and the removal of the tur|bulent &s;ymptoms of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, which we have mentioned, taking place in the convale&s;cent &s;tate, in con&s;equence of a proper admini&s;tration of food, drink, and diffu&s;ible &s;timulants: <HI>all the&s;e</HI> are &s;hortly followed by a &s;imilar &s;tate of the re&s;t of the body, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of indirect debility is the con&s;equence of the fir&s;t ca&s;e; that of direct debility <HI>&s;ucceeds</HI> to the &s;econd, and health over all is the termination of the la&s;t.</P>
<P>LIV. A part, therefore, is the &s;eat of no general affecti|on; the whole body is the &s;eat of them all; becau&s;e, with the inequality <HI>above</HI> related, the whole excitability is effect|ed in them all.</P>
<P>LV. Neither is the affection of the more &s;uffering part the fir&s;t, and afterwards propagated over the &s;y&s;tem; for this good rea&s;on, that, as &s;oon as the excitability is affected any where, it is al&s;o and immediately affected every where.

Likewi&s;e the pain of the gout is not the fir&s;t of the phaenomena of that di&s;ea&s;e.

<P>LVI.

<HEAD>Of Contraction and its Effects.</HEAD>
<P>LVII. THE intire and vigorous contraction with which mu&s;cular fibres are endowed, is in proportion to the degree of excitement upon which it depends<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">It has already been proved, that all the functions depend upon excitement, and therefore contraction among the re&s;t.</NOTE>. This is proved by all the phaenomena of health and di&s;ea&s;e, and by the operations of all the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">iting powers and of all re|medies. Force and propen&s;ity to motion are the &s;ame. We mu&s;t judge from facts, not from appearances. Con|&s;equently,

tremor, convul&s;ion, and every affection com|prehended under it, are to be imputed to debility as their cau&s;e. The hurtful exciting power is a &s;timulus uncom|monly irritating to the part.</P>
<P>LVIII. The degree of contraction, that con&s;titutes &s;pa&s;m, is not an exception from this <HI>propo&s;ition.</HI> It is a continued and deficient function, rather than a great and exact one; and in &s;o far as it is a great contraction, it depends upon the local &s;timulus of di&s;tention, or of &s;ome|thing re&s;embling di&s;tention, it con&s;i&s;ts in dimini&s;hed ex|citement, is devoid of force, and removed by &s;timulant remedies. The appearance of &s;ymptoms, which is ever mi&s;leading, is never to be tru&s;ted in forming any judge|ment. Take now both the fact and the explanation of it.</P>
<P>LIX. As the degree of contraction, in &s;o far as it is a &s;ound function, is connected with force; from that we are to hold it as a certain and demon&s;trated fact, that the den&s;ity of mu&s;cular fibres con&s;idered as &s;imple &s;olids, is proportioned to the degree of their contraction.</P>
<P>LX. It mu&s;t therefore be admitted, that excitement is the cau&s;e of den&s;ity. And the den&s;ity is rendered grea|ter and greater by the excitement in proportion to the de|gree of the latter: Which it is ea&s;y to perceive through all the intermediate degrees <HI>of &s;trength,</HI> from <HI>the highe&s;t, or that</HI> which takes place in madne&s;s, and the den&s;ity cor|re&s;ponding to it, to <HI>the lowe&s;t,</HI> or that debility which is di&s;cerned in the article of death, in death it&s;elf, and after death, with a laxity corrre&s;ponding to it. That this is the fact, is proved by the weakne&s;s of the &s;ame fibres in their dead, and their &s;trength in their living &s;tate; the only cau&s;e of which difference, we know for certain, is excitement<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Experiments have been made by Baron Haller and others, to a&s;|certain the comparative &s;trength of mu&s;cular fibres, and the criterion of judgment was their greater or le&s;&s;er di&s;po&s;ition to break by appended weights; but the power by which any body re&s;i&s;ts &s;tretching, is the den&s;ity of that body.

EXCITEMENT, the effect of the exciting powers, when <HI>of a</HI> proper <HI>degree,</HI> con&s;titutes health; when <HI>either</HI> exce&s;&s;ive or deficient, <HI>it proves the occa&s;ion of</HI> di&s;ea&s;e, and, of predi&s;po&s;ition previous <HI>to the arrival of di&s;ea&s;e.</HI> The &s;tate both of the &s;imple &s;olids and fluids follows that of health as con&s;tituted by the excitement, and a given &s;tate<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This propo&s;ition overturns the principal &s;y&s;tems that have ever appeared in the profe&s;&s;ion of medicine. But more of it after.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&mgr;. The fir&s;t cau&s;e of the formation of &s;imple &s;olids, and the &s;ole one of their pre&s;ervation after, is the excite|ment. Under the direction of the excitement, the living &s;olids produce the blood from an external matter taken in|to <HI>the &s;y&s;tem,</HI> keep it in motion, form its mixture, &s;ecrete from it various fluids, excrete them; ab&s;ord others, and circulate and expel them from the body. It is the excite|ment alone, thro' its varying degrees, that produces either health, di&s;ea&s;es, or the return of the found &s;tate. It alone governs both univer&s;al and local di&s;ea&s;es. Neither of

which ever ari&s;e from faults of the &s;olids or fluids, but al|ways either from encrea&s;ed or dimini&s;hed excitement. The cure of neither is to be directed to the &s;tate of the &s;olids or fluids, and only diminution or the encrea&s;e of excitement. But,</P>
<P>LXIII. Affections peculiar to parts, or organic mala|dies, being foreign from this place of the work, in which the treatment of the general &s;tate of the body is only con&s;i|dered, mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed over at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>LXIV. That the excitement governs all life is proved by the exciting powers, acting always by &s;timulating, and thereby producing excitement; it is proved by the great|er or &s;maller activity of the functions being proportion|ed to the force of the exciting powers; it is proved by the effect of the remedies, which always oppo&s;e deficient, to exce&s;&s;ive, and exce&s;&s;ive, to deficient excitement, in <HI>ef|fecting</HI> the cure of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>LXV. The notion of health and di&s;ea&s;e being different &s;tates, is di&s;proved by the operation of the powers which produce them, and tho&s;e that remove them, being one and the &s;ame.</P>
<P>LXVI. The general di&s;ea&s;es, ari&s;ing from exce&s;&s;ive excitement, are called &s;thenic<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Their old name is phlogi&s;tic; but as that word is ab&s;urdly meta|phorical from an old notion of that &s;ort of di&s;ea&s;es depending upon fire or flame; and becau&s;e it was not a proper contra&s;t to the term here to be oppo&s;ed to it; as al&s;o becau&s;e it is &s;till more ridiculous when applied to plants, which are comprehended in this doctrine; for the&s;e rea&s;ons it has been thought proper to reject it, and &s;ub&s;titute the other in its place.</NOTE>; tho&s;e that origi|nate from a deficient excitement, a&s;thenic.

By a proper u&s;e of high &s;timulants the 30 degrees of lo&s;t excitement may be re&s;tored, and as many of &s;uperfluous excitability di&s;charged, and the excitement and excitability made to meet again at the middle point of 40. If the remedies are carried up to any degree betwixt 40 and 55, they have gone too far, and produced predi&s;po&s;ition to &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es; if &s;till far|ther, but not exceeding 70, they will have produced one or other of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.

<HEAD>Of Predi&s;po&s;ition.</HEAD>
<P>LXXIII. Predi&s;po&s;ition is a middle &s;tate betwixt per|fect health and di&s;ea&s;e. The powers, producing it, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e which produce di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>LXXIV. The period of predi&s;po&s;ition will be &s;horter or longer, according to the greater or le&s;&s;er force of the hurtful powers <HI>that have induced it;</HI> and the interval be|tween health and actual di&s;ea&s;e will be more quickly or &s;lowly got over.</P>
<P>LXXV. That predi&s;po&s;ition nece&s;&s;arily precedes di&s;ea|&s;es, is evident from the fact of its ari&s;ing from the &s;ame exciting powers, acting upon the &s;ame excitability, from which both health and di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;e, and of its being an in|termediate &s;tate betwixt them both. And, as the excite|ment of health differs much from that of di&s;ea&s;e; it is not, therefore, to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the former immediately mounts up to the latter, and &s;kips over the boundaries of predi&s;po&s;ition: nay, the contrary is certain and beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>LXXVI. Contagious di&s;ea&s;es are not an exception from this ob&s;ervation; becau&s;e, whether the matter of contagion act by a &s;timulant or a debilitating operation, its operation is the &s;ame with that of the ordinary powers, that is to &s;ay, its cau&s;e is the &s;ame<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les are cured by the &s;ame means as perip|neumony or any other &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;e; and, excepting the contagious matter, ari&s;e from the &s;ame &s;timulant urtful powers; they mu&s;t, there|fore, with the &s;ame exception, be the &s;ame. The only difference is, that they are accompanyed with a contagious matter, and the other &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es are not. The amount of which is altogether unimport|ant. For, if the ordinary powers have not operated, the affection does not come under the definition of general di&s;ea&s;e; none of the functions reading from their natural &s;tate, and the eruption amounting to no more than a &s;light local complaint. It is, therefore, only of u&s;e to re|gard the general circum&s;tances of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, making no more ac|count of the local part, than to con&s;ider, arrange, and treat it as &s;uch. It is well known, that, when by the means u&s;ed for the cure of &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es without contagion and their &s;equel, eruption, the &s;thenic dia|the&s;is is prevented or removed, the local part gives no trouble; and that the di&s;ea&s;e is never dangerous but from the neglect of that manage|ment. But the management is nothing el&s;e but the ordinary one in any &s;thenic ca&s;e. If it &s;hould be contented, that, all that being granted, &s;till the eruption may contribute a little: Be that &s;o, and it can be but very little; what is the effect? The cure &s;hows it; which is exactly the &s;ame as in &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es without eruption. The di&s;ea&s;e, therefore, being the &s;ame (for its mere local part is out of the que&s;tion, as only re|quiring a peculiar expo&s;ure to cold, which is equally proper in every &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;e); every part of rea&s;oning re&s;pecting it, and, con&s;equently, that affecting the que&s;tion about predi&s;po&s;ition, mu&s;t al&s;o be the &s;ame. If, therefore, other general di&s;ea&s;es have their predi&s;po&s;ition, &s;o mu&s;t the &s;mall-pox, the mea&s;les, and the plague it&s;elf. If it &s;hould &s;till be &s;aid, that the eruptive di&s;ea&s;es, though in other re&s;pects the &s;ame with the non-eruptive&punc; differ, in &s;o far as predi&s;po&s;ition is required as a com|mon circum&s;tance between them; the an&s;wer is, that that difference only re&s;pects their local part, which, without the powers producing the di&s;ea&s;e, is in&s;ignificant and a mere local complaint. As general &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, and as general a&s;thenic ones, conta|gious fever and the plague, to the full extent of their generality, have their period of predi&s;po&s;ition; we may have occa&s;ion afterward to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the que&s;tion about predi&s;po&s;ition to them even as local di&s;ea&s;es, but this is not the place for it; all that was required here being to &s;ettle the que&s;tion about predi&s;po&s;ition to them as general di&s;ea&s;es. In the &s;ame point of view all that has been &s;aid of contagious di&s;ea&s;es, will apply to di&s;ea&s;es in which poi&s;ons may have been concerned.</NOTE>. If, as it &s;ometimes happens, no
<PB N="36" REF="022373_0050_0FB86D70D31934B8">
general affection follows the application of contagion, if no undue exce&s;s or defect of excitement is the con&s;e|quence;
<PB N="37" REF="022373_0051_0FB86D7201DD1CA0">
in that ca&s;e, the affection is altogether local and foreign from this place.</P>
<P>LXXVII. If poi&s;ons communicate any &s;ort of morbid affection without predi&s;po&s;ition, &s;uch an affection, for that very rea&s;on, is not to be con&s;idered as a general di&s;ea&s;e, as al&s;o for this additional rea&s;on, that <HI>the affection</HI> is neither removed nor relieved by the u&s;ual cure of general di&s;ea&s;e;s and the diver&s;ity of the effect proves, that both the cau&s;e and exciting hurtful power are different from the general ones. In one word, &s;ince predi&s;po&s;ition and di&s;ea&s;e are the &s;ame, varying only in degree, the unavoidable con|clu&s;ion is, that whatever, with a given force, produces the latter, <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> with a le&s;&s;er force, will produce the for|mer. The only cure of mo&s;t poi&s;ons is their early di&s;|charge from <HI>the &s;y&s;tem.</HI> And if, as often happens, others, by wounding an organ nece&s;&s;ary to life, are not curable, but fatal; the effect of both is foreign from our pre&s;ent &s;ubject, and to be referred to local di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>LXXVIII. The only thing to be regarded in the powers producing either predi&s;po&s;ition to general di&s;ea&s;es, or tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es <HI>in their full force,</HI> is the degree of the for|mer<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">tho&s;e that produce the predi&s;po&s;ition,</NOTE> compared with <HI>that of</HI> the latter<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">tho&s;e that produce the di&s;ea&s;e,</NOTE>, or of the in|dividual powers compared with one another; for the pur|po&s;e of di&s;cerning the degree of hurtful power that each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and the degree of curative means to be employed in order to remove the hurtful effect<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">The di&s;tinctions of the powers producing predi&s;po&s;ition, and of tho&s;e that excite di&s;ea&s;e, under the general appellation of predi&s;ponent or occa&s;ional cau&s;es have been multiplied and refined upon without end. But the whole &s;y&s;tem of remote cau&s;es, as they have been called, is fal&s;e in its fir&s;t idea. The hurtful powers, whatever they be called, that produce di&s;ea&s;es, al&s;o produce the predi&s;po&s;ition to them. Which be|ing once admitted, as it henceforth mu&s;t, the whole fabric of aitiology or of the doctrine of remote cau&s;es mu&s;t fall to the ground: Con&s;e|quently, &s;imply remote cau&s;es, not divi&s;ible into predi&s;ponent and occa|&s;ional; relative remote cau&s;es, or &s;uch as are &s;o divi&s;ible; internal and external predi&s;ponent, internal and external occa&s;ional, cau&s;es; ap|proaching cau&s;es, or cau&s;ae propriories proximate cau&s;es, of which, not only one, but often &s;everal, are a&s;&s;igned to every di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t cea&s;e in medical language, and the &s;tudent's attention be turned away from the endle&s;s pur&s;uit of di&s;tinctions without a difference, to the &s;tudy of the &s;olid and u&s;eful facts that nature holds up to his contemplation in great abundance, when once his eyes are fairly opened to behold them.</NOTE>.</P>

LXXIX. The knowledge of predi&s;po&s;ition is of great importance: as enabling the phy&s;ician to prevent di&s;ea|&s;es<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">from his acquaintance with the powers that lead to them.</NOTE>, comprehend the true cau&s;e of them founded in pre|di&s;po&s;ition, and to di&s;tingui&s;h them from local affections, which are widely different from them<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Such is the &s;implicity to which medicine is now reduced, that when a phy&s;ician comes to the bed-&s;ide of a patient, he has only three things to &s;ettle in his mind.

<P>LXXX. As the predi&s;po&s;ition, to di&s;ea&s;es, and the di&s;|ea&s;es them&s;elves, are the &s;ame &s;tate; a great criterion, by which general di&s;ea&s;es may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from local ones, will be <HI>found in this &s;ingle circum&s;tance,</HI> that general di&s;ea&s;es are always, local never, preceded by predi&s;po&s;i|tion<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">An inflammation in &s;ome part of the &s;tomach, or as it has been commonly called, "the Inflammation of the Stomach," as if it were always of the &s;ame kind, produces many &s;ymptoms, that bear &s;o great a re&s;emblance to general &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as peripneumony, that by &s;y&s;tematics and no&s;ologi&s;ts, it, as well as many other inflammations of internal cavities, have been united into an order of di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uppo&s;ed all to partake of one common nature. The Ga&s;tritis, however, which is its no&s;ological name, is e&s;&s;entially different, both from Peripneumony and all the other general di&s;ea&s;es of the order with which it is a&s;&s;ociated, both in other re&s;pects, and in that of which we are &s;peaking. As ari|&s;ing from certain local hurtful powers, it is not preceded by predi&s;po&s;i|tion. So when I come to the bed-&s;ide of a patient under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, though I had no previous knowledge of the nature of his di&s;or|der, whenever I hear that he has &s;wallowed ground gla&s;s, &s;mall fi&s;h|bones, or, perhaps, a great quantity of Caien pepper, I can be at no lo&s;s to di&s;cern the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, and to find, that it is altogether local; and that for two of the be&s;t of all rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, the per&s;on ha|ving been in perfect health immediately before that accident; and, &s;e|condly, that the &s;ub&s;tances which he had &s;wallowed were &s;uch as would naturally divide a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound part, or, in the language of our profe&s;&s;ion, produce a &s;olution of continuity in it. From this, again, inflam|mation is an in&s;eparable con&s;equence. And it is equally an univer&s;a fact in the animal economy, that, when any part, whether internal or external, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great &s;en&s;ibility, is wounded or otherwi&s;e inju|red in its &s;ub&s;tance, the pain ari&s;ing from the inflammation &s;uperinduced, &s;preads &s;ymptoms of di&s;order over the whole &s;y&s;tem, which are liable to mi&s;lead tho&s;e, who are not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the criterion we here point out.

<P>LXXXVIII. THE indication for the cure of &s;thenic diathe&s;is is to dimini&s;h, that for the cure of the a&s;thenic diathe&s;is, is to encrea&s;e the excitement, and to continue to encrea&s;e it, till that degree of it, which con&s;titutes the mean betwixt its extremes, and which is &s;uited to good health, be replaced. This is the only indication of cure that univer&s;al di&s;ea&s;es admit of.</P>
<P>LXXXIX. As both diathe&s;es ari&s;e from an operation of the exciting powers, the &s;ame <HI>in kind,</HI> but varying in degree; &s;o they are both prevented and removed by an ac|tion of the remedies, al&s;o the &s;ame <HI>in kind,</HI> but oppo&s;ite in degree, to that which produced them.

<P>XC. The remedies, therefore of &s;thenic diathe&s;is are powers, exciting by a weaker &s;timulus, than that which is &s;uited to health; and are in this work to be denomi|nated, for the &s;ake of brevity, Debilitating or Anti&s;thenic Remedies.</P>
<P>XCI. The remedies of a&s;thenic diathe&s;is are powers, ex|citing with more force, than &s;uits the be&s;t health; to be named here in the practice &s;timulants or &s;thenic, for the more convenient di&s;tinction of them from the other re|medies.</P>
<P>XCII. The&s;e are to be employed with more or le&s;s free|dom in proportion to the higher or lower degree of <HI>each</HI> di|athe&s;is, and of the local affection depending upon it. And &s;uch a choice of each &s;hould be made in &s;uch a way as that the mo&s;t powerful may be adapted to the mo&s;t violent ca&s;e. But the cure of any di&s;ea&s;e of con&s;iderable violence, and &s;carce of any at all, is never to be entru&s;ted to any one remedy&punc; The u&s;e of &s;everal remedies is preferable to that of one; becau&s;e, thereby, their direct energy is ap|plied to the &s;y&s;tem to a greater extent, and the excitability
<PB N="40" REF="022373_0060_0FB86D8A09835550">
is more completely and more equally affected. The per|&s;on, who means that his remedies &s;hould go to a parti|cular part<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">and there, from a local operation, and not by an affection of the excitability, &s;erve the purpo&s;e,</NOTE>, is equally wi&s;e, as <HI>any</HI> one <HI>would</HI> be, who, by cropping a twig, expects to eradicate a tree.

<P>XCV. Since every univer&s;al di&s;ea&s;e, every predi&s;po&s;i|tion, depends upon encrea&s;ed or dimini&s;hed excitement, and is removed by the conver&s;ion of that into the degree <HI>which con&s;titutes</HI> the mean betwixt both; for that rea&s;on in order both to prevent and cure di&s;ea&s;e we mu&s;t always u&s;e the indication propo&s;ed, and &s;timulate or debilitate; never lay by, nor tru&s;t to the &s;uppo&s;ed powers of nature, which have no real exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>XCVI. In the indication of cure, the only regard to be had to morbific matter, is to allow time for its pa&s;&s;ing out of the body. For whether it acts, like all other exciting powers, &s;ometimes by a &s;timulating<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">as in the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les,</NOTE>, &s;ometimes by a debilitating operation<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">as in contagious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">evers and the plauge,</NOTE>, or whether <HI>its action con&s;i&s;t in</HI> only giving the peculiar form of its re&s;pective di&s;ea&s;e, and, thereby, adding a local affection to a general one; in ei|ther ca&s;e there is no room for a new indication.</P>
<P>XCVII. For if the di&s;ea&s;e, as a general one, be pro|perly managed, every eruption, and its con&s;equences,

every &s;pecies of inflammation, every &s;pecies of ulceration, give way to the happy effect of the general plan of cure. And, when a contrary event takes place in con&s;equence of a bad method of cure, the local &s;ymptoms are propor|tionally aggravated. This is proved in the &s;mall-pox long ago, and in the mea&s;les lately<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">After the di&s;covery of the nature of the catarrh, the catarrhal &s;ymptoms in the mea&s;les came naturally to be enquired into. A full trial was given to the refrigerant debilitating plan, in the author's own fa|mily, as well as among &s;everal patients, and la&s;tly among near an hun|dred patients in England, treated by the father of one of the author's pupils; who all did well, while others, who ware kept warm, according to a practice that Dr. Sydenham had left as he found it among his Alexipharmac cotemporaries, many died, and all had a bad recovery. The Author's own &s;on and name-&s;on, a boy about &s;ix years of age, was &s;tript half naked and allowed to go out and play as he plea&s;ed. The only check upon him was, his being allowed nothing but fluid vegetable mat|ter, when he returned home with a keen appetite. This matter will be further explained, and in a more proper place, afterward. But, what has been &s;aid, was in illu&s;tration of the hint in the text.</NOTE>, but, with equal certain|ty; it is proved by the plague, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> as often as it has been treated with any judgement, and by remedies proper in kind and admini&s;tered in due proportion; it is proved by the malignant, or gangrenous &s;ore throat<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">This ca&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e has been con&s;idered, as wholly and &s;olely &s;eat|ed in the throat, and therefore conjoined with other di&s;ea&s;es, where that local affection was under&s;tood to be the e&s;&s;ential &s;ymptom, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ymptom that connected all the ca&s;es. But the other ca&s;es are &s;thenic or to be cured in the ordinary way of bleeding and evacuation; while &s;uch a practice is certain death in it, as being not only an a&s;thenic ca&s;e, that is a ca&s;e of debility, but one of the highe&s;t; and, in&s;tead of depending upon the affection of the throat, the affection of the throat depends on it. Give &s;timulants to the patients labouring under the inflammatory &s;ore throat, and you kill them; bleed, purge, vomit, and &s;tarve, in the gangrenous ca&s;e, and you en&s;ure the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate. Such, however, are the di&s;ea&s;es, that &s;y&s;tematics, no&s;ologi&s;ts, and other &s;trangers in the city of nature, have, from their ignorance of the place, in &s;pite of their natural di&s;tance, brought all together. (See Dr. Cullen's Genera Mor|borum, all the three editions, genus VII.)

And the &s;ame pro|po&s;ition is &s;o true, with re&s;pect to the <HI>three</HI> former, that, though the <HI>contagious</HI> matter has been applied, yet, without the general hurtful powers preceding, no true general di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;es, the danger encrea&s;es in proportion to their violence, and the whole cure depends upon the general remedies.

But neither does that &s;ugge&s;t a new indication of cure; &s;ince the only means of effecting it are tho&s;e, which otherwi&s;e remove both the diathe&s;es in proportion to their force, and which are not &s;erviceable as local, but as general remedies<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">The di&s;covery of the &s;upport of per&s;piration upon a principle, which extends to all phenomena of the &s;ubject, was re&s;erved for this work. The heating remedies of the Alexipharmac phy&s;icians were intented to &s;up|port per&s;piration, and thereby, throw out a morbific matter: Which was a very unlucky thought in the &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, the principal of which were peripneumony, of which we have already &s;o often &s;poken; phrenitis, in which the brain was &s;uppo&s;ed to be inflamed; and the &s;mall-pox and mea|&s;les; becau&s;e the nature of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, and the tendency of all the powers producing them, was to check per&s;piration, (&s;ee No. LXI.) from the exce&s;s of their &s;timulus; con&s;equently, the addition of more &s;timuli, by way of cure, was to check it &s;till more. But tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are only three out of the hundred of general di&s;ea&s;es: whereas the followers of a great man, who corrected that abu&s;e through a fiery per&s;ecution, <GAP DESC="foreign">, again&s;t him&s;elf, went all into a much wor&s;e extreme. Their imitation of their ma&s;ter tran&s;ported them into a rage to carry on the plan of promo|ting per&s;piration, by the &s;ame means, through the remaining 97 of the hundred.

For, as it is the na|ture of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es to tran&s;mit too great a quantity of fluids through the per&s;piratory pores, in con&s;equence of the debility which con&s;titutes their cau&s;e; certainly the encrea&s;e of that debility, that is to &s;ay, the en|crea&s;e of the cau&s;e, &s;hould encrea&s;e the effect. Which it most certainly did, through all the &s;y&s;tems that have appeared for more than a century pa&s;t.

The aim, however, of all &s;uch per&s;ons (with the exception only of tho&s;e who are of an advanced age, or of tho&s;e who&s;e debility threatens to run a certain cour&s;e), &s;hould be to lay a&s;ide the daily u&s;e of drink altogether, and to indulge in occa&s;ional approaches to exce&s;s as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible. Some per&s;ons, even beyond the fiftieth year of their age, when they found they could eat and perform all their other functions with vigour, have had the re&s;olution to ab&s;tain from all &s;ort of &s;trong drink, not only with impunity, but with a mo&s;t wonderful improvement of their health and vigour. Another advantage, ari&s;ing from this management, is, that, whenever any di&s;ea&s;e, to which a per&s;on may be liable, (&s;uch as the gout, various affections of de|bility, chiefly prevalent in the alimentary canal; in a word, the di&s;|ea&s;es of either form of debility), either returns, or threatens to return; a return to the u&s;e of wine and other &s;trong drink will then become an excellent remedy, and even &s;upercede the u&s;e of the high diffu&s;ible ones. That practice would be attended with this further advantage, that, when the occa&s;ion that called for it was over, and the di&s;ea&s;e prevented or re|moved, the per&s;on might again lay a&s;ide the u&s;e of drink, with all the good con&s;equences he had formerly experienced from the practice, and thereby both prolong his life, improve his health, and enjoy the proper and vigorous u&s;e of all his functions.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>&ugr; If the diffu&s;ible &s;timuli, after they have been employ|ed, are too quickly withdrawn, they, in the &s;ame manner as the more durable, allow the excitability to accumulate, and direct debility to come on, and con&s;equently may be &s;aid to produce a&s;thenic diathe&s;is.

And all the hurtful effects which they have mo&s;t untruly, to the great detriment of mankind, been &s;aid ra|ther, than are now &s;aid, to occa&s;ion, ari&s;e not from them|&s;elves, but from the want of knowledge how to manage them.

In this way the circulation goes on in all ca|&s;es while life remains; contraction and relaxation con&s;tantly alternate; the former propelling the wave before the latter opens to receive the next. But the ve&s;&s;el may be in different &s;tates with re&s;pect to its power of either contracting or relaxing. When it is weak, which every part of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem is as often as all the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem is weak, both the contraction and relaxation of each portion of ve&s;&s;el is imperfect. The contraction from its &s;mallne&s;s, and the relaxation from its being more owing to the pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate of the &s;imple, than the active &s;tate of the living, fibres, leave betwixt them a large diameter upon the whole. But, in a vigorous, or &s;thenic, &s;tate of the whole &s;y&s;tem in general, and of that of the ve&s;&s;els in particular, the contractions are &s;trong and forcible, and the relaxations active and in con&s;ent with the contractions.

This &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;el, in &s;o far as it re&s;pects the mu&s;cular fibres, is its tone; in &s;o far as it re|&s;pects them as &s;imple &s;olids, its den&s;ity.

<P>CXXXIX. An evident cau&s;e of a&s;thenic diathe&s;is is that &s;tate of the intellectual function, in which exce&s;s
<PB N="75" REF="022373_0089_0FB86DC60990DE28">
in thinking, by wa&s;ting the excitability, ends in indirect debility; or that deficient, weak, vacant &s;tate of mind, uncapable of keeping up a train, which produces the &s;ame hurtful effect by direct debility. This faulty &s;tate of the mind contributes greatly to weaken <HI>the &s;y&s;tem</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">It may often be remarked by phy&s;icians, that their patients, after every other proper part of cure has been executed, are never completely re&s;tored to their healthy &s;tate, till they are again engaged in their u&s;ual occupations both of mind and body.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CXL. Violent pa&s;&s;ions of mind, as great anger, keen grief, unbridled joy, going to &s;uch a pitch as to de&s;troy excitability, have the &s;ame effect as exce&s;&s;ive thinking, and admit of all the &s;ame rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>CXLI. A force of pa&s;&s;ion ri&s;ing to the height of ex|hau&s;ting the excitability, induces that a&s;thenic diathe&s;is, which is occa&s;ioned by indirect debility, and di&s;ea&s;es of that &s;tamp.

<P>CXLII. On the contrary, when there is a deficiency of pa&s;&s;ion, as in melancholy, grief, fear, terror, de&s;pair, which are only lower degrees of joy, a&s;&s;urance, and hope, and imply no more than a diminution of exciting pa&s;&s;ions, not emotions <HI>of a nature</HI> oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e, and po&s;itive; their tendency is to produce the a&s;thenic diathe&s;is, which depends upon direct debility. The immediate production of this is lo&s;s of appetite, loathing of food, &s;ickne&s;s at &s;to|mach, vomiting, pain of the &s;tomach<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">called cardialgia by &s;y&s;tematics</NOTE>, loo&s;e belly with|out pain, the &s;ame with pain, indige&s;tion<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">called dy&s;pep&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</NOTE>, cholic, the the gout, and fevers.</P>
<P>CXLIII. The <HI>exerci&s;e of</HI> the &s;en&s;es, when it is agreea|ble, has a very great effect in exciting the whole body, and
<PB N="76" REF="022373_0090_0FB86DC7C7488850">
in producing emotions, which, together with the hurtful powers mentioned above, may ea&s;ily contribute to the pro|duction of &s;thenic diathe&s;is. Tho&s;e emotions are exem|plified in drinking, dancing, in agreeable entertainments where the eye is dazzled with the &s;plendour of the di&s;hes, of the company, and of all the objects around.</P>
<P>CXLIV. The energy of the &s;ame <HI>exerci&s;e of the &s;en&s;es,</HI> when it is exce&s;&s;ive, and carries the effects, ju&s;t now men|tioned, too far, produces indirect debility. On the con|trary, when the &s;en&s;es are either in part de&s;troyed, or in part dulled, or di&s;agreeably affected<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Nothing is more clearly di&s;agreeable than an ob&s;cure light, as when one reads with a &s;mall or un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;&s;ed candle. Hence the luxury of more candles than one, or of wax or &s;permaceti candles. This is often experienced at Ranelagh, and may be &s;een in children exqui&s;itely amu&s;ed.</NOTE>, the mind is de|jected, and the whole body thrown into <HI>a &s;tate</HI> of languor and direct debility. And, in both ca&s;es, e&s;pecially when there is a concurrence of other debilitating hurtful powers the a&s;thenic diathe&s;is ari&s;es.</P>
<P>CXLV. The effect of the air<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">upon the human body,</NOTE>, independent of its qualities, as they are called, or its properties, and its u&s;e in &s;upporting re&s;piration, is le&s;s obvious to ob&s;ervation<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">than the other powers that have been &s;poken of,</NOTE>; at the &s;ame time it cannot be doubted, that its application to the whole &s;urface of the body is a &s;timulus not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with. The air is &s;eldom applied in a pure &s;tate: it is commonly blended with foreign matters that dimini&s;h its force of &s;timulus; and, while its &s;alutary &s;timulus depends upon its purity, at the &s;ame time it is uncertain whether e|ver its purity goes &s;o far as to &s;timulate in exce&s;s, and there|by produce &s;thenic diathe&s;is. The baloons, lately invented, by which men get above the clouds, would &s;erve excellently to throw light upon that matter, if it were not for the cold <HI>that</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="022373_0091_0FB86DD0A2C8DC88">
accompanies this progre&s;s. Be that as it may; &s;ince we never live in the pure&s;t air, and yet live commodiou&s;ly e|nough, it is, therefore, credible, that too pure an air has a ten|dency to &s;timulate in exce&s;s, and, therefore, produce &s;the|nic diathe&s;is.</P>
<P>CXLVI. But, as nothing is more u&s;ual than impurity of air, and every impurity dimini&s;hes its &s;timulus, a very impure air, or air blended with impure matters, without doubt debilitates, and produces a&s;thenic diathe&s;is. Ac|cordingly, impure air is a frequent cau&s;e of typhus, as is evident from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate of tho&s;e who died in the black hole of Calcutta. Whether ever the air, from an exce&s;s of pu|rity, produces a&s;thenic diathe&s;is, is the more doubtful, that, as has been &s;aid, it is as yet undecided whether it produces &s;thenic diathe&s;is or now.</P>
<P>&Egr;. Contagious matter, in &s;o far as it may have any ten|dency to produce general di&s;ea&s;es, <HI>in</HI> one form produces &s;thenic, in another a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, and, therefore, acts like the ordinary hurtful powers of either &s;ort, and admits of all the &s;ame rea&s;oning. But, in &s;o far as it only occa|&s;ions the eruption, without making any change in the ex|citement, it is to be referred to the local di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>&Zgr;. To poi&s;ons, if they act as general &s;timulants, all the rea&s;oning that has been employed with re&s;pect to the other hurtful powers, will apply. It is not, however, likely that they are general &s;timulants.</P>
<P>CXLVII. It is &s;eldom from the &s;eparate, almo&s;t al|ways from the united operation of all the powers, that both the diathe&s;is, whether as remaining <HI>within the range</HI> of predi&s;po&s;ition, or ri&s;ing to the degree of actual morbid &s;tate are produced, and from no inherent power in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>

<P>CLIII. The encrea&s;e of <HI>the force of</HI> the &s;en&s;es, of the motions, of the intellectual faculty, and of the pa&s;&s;ions, depends upon the encrea&s;e of excitement in every one of their organs, among other actions, quickening the moti|on of the blood <HI>through them.</HI></P>
<P>CLIV. The coming on of every &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;e is announced by a &s;hivering. It depends upon a dimini&s;hed per&s;piration, by means of the diathe&s;is being <HI>exqui&s;itely</HI> &s;trong in the extreme ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin. The &s;ame is the
<PB N="81" REF="022373_0095_0FB86DD678428AC8">
explanation to be given of the &s;en&s;e of cold, which com|monly accompanies the &s;hivering; and the &s;ame is the ex|planation of the dryne&s;s of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>CLV. In the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es, the pul&s;e is &s;tronger, har|der, and fuller, and &s;omewhat more frequent, than <HI>in its</HI> &s;ound <HI>&s;tate.</HI> Its fulne&s;s and hardne&s;s is owing to the ta|king animal food plentifully during the predi&s;po&s;ition. The force and frequency is occa&s;ioned by the &s;ame and any other &s;timulus, as that of &s;trong drink; that of the diffu|&s;ible kind, and that of exerci&s;e, whether corporeal or men|tal: Nay all the &s;timulant hurtful powers are participant of the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>CLVI. If, in the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, the pul&s;e &s;ometimes becomes weaker, &s;ofter, and quicker, that is a bad &s;ign, and occa&s;ioned either by the debilitating plan of cure being pu&s;hed beyond the proper bounds: or, in con|&s;equence of a neglect of that &s;ort of cure, it may be owing to &s;ome debility induced by the exce&s;s of excitement. The former <HI>of the&s;e</HI> is direct, the latter indirect debi|lity; both to be avoided.</P>
<P>CLVII. The complexion in the ve&s;&s;els, which is of|ten a con&s;equence of a previous appearance of palene&s;s, and great quantity of &s;ecreted fluids, is occa&s;ioned by an over|proportion of blood, in con&s;equence of an exce&s;&s;ive &s;thenic diathe&s;is ob&s;tructing the per&s;piration. The &s;ame is the cau&s;e of the head-ach and pains in different parts. For, as the head-ach &s;o quickly and ea&s;ily yields to bleeding, it is, therefore, &s;eldom to be &s;u&s;pected of being owing to inflammation within the head. And <HI>the rea&s;on for &s;o think|ing is &s;trengthened by this further circum&s;tance,</HI> that the in|flammation ari&s;ing in general di&s;ea&s;es always affects an ex|ternal part, as far as that fact has been enquired into<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vide above, CXIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CLVIII. The delirium al&s;o, that &s;ometimes ari&s;es in a violent &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e, is not to be imputed to inflamma|tion,
<PB N="82" REF="022373_0096_0FB86A5D6DF0C1E8">
and for the &s;ame rea&s;on; for it yields &s;o much to bleeding and other evacuations, that there is no rea&s;on for &s;u&s;pecting inflammation within the head. That abun|dance of blood in the ve&s;&s;els, di&s;tending the&s;e to exce&s;s, is the cau&s;e of the whole affair, is proved on the one hand by the redne&s;s of the face, implying &s;uch abundance, and on the other by bleeding, removing the di&s;ea&s;e at once.</P>
<P>CLIX. Thir&s;t and heat, which are al&s;o remarkable &s;ymptoms in &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, depend upon the &s;thenic dia|the&s;is in the extreme ve&s;&s;els of the fauces and &s;kin; <HI>the dia|the&s;is</HI> &s;o ob&s;tructing the ve&s;&s;els as not to allow a return of per&s;piration, but to &s;uffer, however, the blood to pa&s;s in|to the very neighbourhood of the ends of the ve&s;&s;els, and, by means of the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the per&s;piration, to accumu|late, under the cuticle, the heat generated in the &s;y&s;tem. Thus, in the throat, from an affection of the ends of the ve&s;&s;els, the &s;aliva and other fluids, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low of which the throat is lubricated, and freed from that &s;en&s;e of dryne&s;s, which is called thir&s;t, are now confined<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">and prevented to flow out,</NOTE>, and thereby produce thir&s;t.</P>
<P>CLX. Hoar&s;ene&s;s, cough, and expectoration, which are &s;ometimes ob&s;erved in &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, commonly pro|ceed, and &s;ucceed to each other in the following order. There is fir&s;t often a hoar&s;ene&s;s, then a dry cough, then a cough with expectoration. The cau&s;e of the hoar&s;e|ne&s;s and dry cough is an ob&s;truction of the exhalents and mucous ve&s;&s;els, which terminate in the bronchia, &s;till occa&s;ioned by a violent &s;thenic diathe&s;is, and prevented from tran&s;mitting their contents to lubicrate the air-ve&s;&s;els<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">The bronchia are the divi&s;ions of the wind-pipe running through the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs, and blended with the blood-ve&s;&s;els. In the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs, be&s;ides the&s;e two &s;ets of ve&s;&s;els, the air-ve&s;&s;els and blood-ve&s;&s;els, there are likewi&s;e exhalants, &s;mall arteries, and mu|cous glands, coming off from the extremities of the red arteries. The wind-pipe is covered with the latter; and the great quantity of mucus thrown up from the lungs, often in perfect health, and in innumerable ca&s;es, both of &s;thenic and a&s;thenic general di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ufficiently proves the exi&s;tence of the &s;ource from which they flow.</NOTE>, &s;o as that hoar&s;ene&s;s may be removed, and the ex|pectoration
<PB N="83" REF="022373_0097_0FB86A61C4D59838">
proceed with freedom. Again, the expectora|tion is <HI>next</HI> freely made, becau&s;e the diathe&s;is, being now dimini&s;hed, and allowing the ends of the ve&s;&s;els to be re|laxed, and the fluids to be poured out in abundance upon the air-ve&s;&s;els, is the occa&s;ion of the fluids producing a commotion of the excitability over this whole organ, and by the convul&s;ive motion, which is called cough, of being them&s;elves thrown out.</P>
<P>CLXI. As the greater freedom of expectoration now implies an abatement of the diathe&s;is; &s;o too great a flow and too long a continuance of it &s;hows, that the diathe&s;is is now ru&s;hing in the a&s;thenic <HI>&s;tate,</HI> either from indirect debility, as when the di&s;ea&s;e, in its progre&s;s, has much ex|hau&s;ted the excitability, or from direct debility as when the plan of cure, proper <HI>in kind,</HI> has been pu&s;hed beyond the bounds.</P>
<P>CLXII. Tho&s;e &s;ame &s;ymptoms<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">mentioned ju&s;t now,</NOTE>, while they &s;top &s;hort of the range of direct debility, or are not yet chan|ged into the indirect, are occa&s;ioned by heat, and what|ever &s;timulates in exce&s;s, and removed by cold and what|ever acts as a weakening power.</P>
<P>CLXIII. Palene&s;s, &s;hriveling of the &s;kin, clearne&s;s of the urine, and bound belly, which chiefly happen about the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, ari&s;e from a degree of the di|athe&s;is, &s;hutting up the ends of the ve&s;&s;els in &s;uch a man|ner, that either nothing is excreted, or the thiner part, as in the urine, only e&s;capes. The cure of the affection of the urine, of the ob&s;tructed per&s;piration and co&s;tivene&s;s,
<PB N="84" REF="022373_0098_0FB86A6484ED8538">
&s;hows that the diathe&s;is is now gradually abating, the di&s;|ea&s;e becoming mild, and now upon the eve of being tho|roughly removed by emetics, purgatives, and &s;udorifics, and the u&s;e of other debilitating remedies.</P>
<P>CLXIV. In &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, when they are gentle, the appetite is often not much dimini&s;hed, and oftener more food can be taken than is &s;erviceable. But, unle&s;s the lighte&s;t vegetable matter only, and that in the form of watery potion, or in a fluid form, be given, every mor|&s;el of it will do harm.</P>
<P>CLXV. But, when either from indulgence in food of a rich nature, or from employing a &s;timulant plan of cure, or from the di&s;ea&s;e having, from the beginning, ari&s;en from very violent, hurtful powers, and now attained its highe&s;t degree of violence; in any, or all the&s;e circum|&s;tances, both the other bad &s;ymptoms, mentioned above, break out directly, and the violent di&s;orders of the &s;to|mach, or an accute pain of the thorax, &s;how them&s;elves indirectly.</P>
<P>CLXVI. In a violent diathe&s;is, therefore, where there is little appetite for food, but a very great de&s;ire for drink; with the latter the patient is by all means to be gratified; but the former &s;hould be avoided, as producing loathing, &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach, and vomiting, Tho&s;e &s;ymptoms are not u&s;ually of long duration, unle&s;s when the diathe&s;is is now going, or actually gone, into the a&s;thenic &s;tate by the means that have been mentioned above<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Vide la&s;t paragraph and a few immediately preceding it.</NOTE>, and, by re|moving the other &s;ymptoms by the proper debilitating plan of cure, they go off; but when the &s;tomach &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting are urgent, and begin now to be a little more ob&s;tinate, and of a little more duration, one may know that they &s;till remain &s;hort of the change into indi|rect debility, <HI>by the following marks:</HI> if the pul&s;e &s;till main|tains
<PB N="85" REF="022373_0099_0FB86A6611A08708">
moderation in its frequency, and does not much a|bate of its fullne&s;s and force; if artificial vomiting and purging dimini&s;h the morbid vomiting, and, in one word, if the debilitating plan of cure &s;till &s;ucceeds. But, it will then at la&s;t be under&s;tood that the di&s;ea&s;e is altogether changed, and its cau&s;e converted into the oppo&s;ite, when tho&s;e &s;ymptoms every day encrea&s;e; when the pul&s;e becomes weaker and weaker; when gripes in the inte&s;tines, and liquid &s;tools, are &s;uperadded to the &s;ymptoms that di&s;|turb the &s;tomach, and when the anti&s;thenic or debilita|ting plan of cure is now of evident detriment<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See above, CIX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CLXVII. While the &s;ame &s;ymptoms<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines,</NOTE> <HI>&s;till</HI> &s;top &s;hort of indirect debility, the exce&s;&s;ive excitement in the &s;tomach being of quicker tendency to indirect debility there than any where el&s;e, upon account of the &s;tomach's great &s;en&s;i|bility, and the force of the more powerful &s;timuli being chiefly exerted upon it, produces &s;ymptoms of di&s;turbance<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See above, LIV.</NOTE>; for the mo&s;t powerful &s;timuli, and tho&s;e that are &s;ignally powerful in producing &s;thenic diathe&s;is<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">as high &s;ea&s;oned animal food, wine, &s;pirituous drink, cordials, and the whole train of high diffu&s;ible &s;timuli, &s;ome of the&s;e, as meat and wine, have no effect upon the external &s;urface, or any other part: others, as &s;ome of the condiments, &s;uch as mu&s;tard and &s;trong &s;pirits, and above all the diffu&s;ible &s;timulants, as aether, camphor, and opium in a liquid form, do act upon the &s;econd, and by their application to it &s;upport their own internal u&s;e.

<P>CLXXII. Inflammation, al&s;o, as often as it affects a vi|tal part, produces &s;ymptoms of di&s;turbance. Whether ever the general &s;thenic inflammation affects the brain and its membranes, is hitherto not a&s;certained<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Phrenitis has been thought, and commonly even defined, an in|flammation of the brain; an opinion that, however univer&s;al, &s;eems to be liable to much doubt: nay, there are many rea&s;ons for adopting an appo&s;ite one, as will appear from the rea&s;oning in this paragraph of the text.</NOTE>. And it is more probable, that the commotion of the head, and other di&s;turbing &s;ymptoms of phrenitis, do not depend upon inflammation, as the following phaenomena &s;eem to &s;how: <HI>The</HI> fir&s;t <HI>of tho&s;e is,</HI> the ca&s;e by which the cure is affected, the whole tumult of <HI>&s;ymptoms</HI> readily yield|ing to bleeding, purging, and other a&s;thenic<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">what are commonly called antiphlogi&s;tic, we call debilitating.</NOTE> remedies; and, it not being very credible, that the effect of actual inflammation in a part &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to life, could be &s;o ea&s;ily effaced.

<P>CLXXIII. The &s;ame<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">that we have a&s;&s;igned as the ca&s;e of phrenitic affection al&s;o</NOTE> is the cau&s;e of head-ach, redne&s;s of the eye, as well as of delirium.</P>
<P>CLXXIV. There is, however, no rea&s;on to doubt, but that inflammation is the cau&s;e of that di&s;turbance, which happens to the lungs <HI>in peripneumony.</HI> To the part where the pain is <HI>felt</HI> externally, whatever part of the thorax it is, an actual inflammation is oppo&s;ed internally. And, as the inflammation is proportioned to the degree of general &s;thenic diathe&s;is, and never happens but in a high degree of that diathe&s;is; &s;o that the pain is proportioned to the degree of inflammation<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">The inflammation was &s;uppo&s;ed a chief and primary circum&s;tance, and its cau&s;e and &s;eat, the cau&s;e and &s;eat of the whole di&s;ea&s;e; while the general &s;thenic diathe&s;is, and all the &s;ymptoms depending on it, was &s;uppo&s;ed the offspring of the inflammation. But the truth is, in every re&s;pect, the rever&s;e of this account. The general &s;thenic diathe&s;is is the effect of the general exciting hurtful powers. As the effect of the&s;e, in a le&s;&s;er degree, it exi&s;ts during the predi&s;po&s;ition, and before the ar|rival of the di&s;ea&s;e; and, after the di&s;ea&s;e is come on, it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, as cer|tainly as &s;uch, for, one, two, or three days, as afterwards, when the &s;ign of the inflammation, the pain, makes its appearance. It is only an in|crea&s;e of it, that induces the latter: and it is not to be cured by any con|trivance of throwing any thing into the inflamed part, there being no &s;uch thing to be found in nature, but by the &s;everal means of removing the common cau&s;e, that is, evacuant and other debilitating remedies. Tho&s;e, while, at the &s;ame time, they remove the other &s;ymptoms, by al&s;o removing the di&s;ea&s;e, prove that the common cau&s;e of the whole is the general diathe&s;is. The inflammation, therefore, like every other the cau&s;e of the general di&s;order, is a con&s;equence, in&s;tead of being &s;ymptom.</NOTE>; and the &s;tate of the pul&s;e mu&s;t be e&s;tima|ted by paying a due regard to its cau&s;e. In <HI>the ca&s;e of</HI> an high diathe&s;is, and high degree of inflammation, its effect, the pain, &s;eated in &s;ome part of the thorax, &s;ometimes a|bout

When the di|athe&s;is, and the part of it <HI>we call</HI> inflammation, is le&s;s, the pain is le&s;s acute, more dull, and ea&s;ier to be borne; the pul&s;e is<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">not &s;oft and yielding, according to the common notion, but</NOTE> <HI>&s;till</HI> hard and &s;trong, though le&s;s &s;o than in the other ca&s;e.

But the hardne&s;s of the pul&s;e, and increa&s;e of pain, is never to be imputed to the inflammation being &s;eated in the membrane; nor is the &s;oftne&s;s of the former, and dullne&s;s of the latter, to <HI>be attributed</HI> to its occupying the &s;oft parenchymatous &s;ub|&s;tance<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Such, however, and many other di&s;tinctions, equally fal&s;e, fri|volous, and mi&s;leading in the practice, have been at all times univer&s;al|ly received by &s;y&s;tematic, and lately by no&s;ological writers.</NOTE>, it being impo&s;&s;ible that an inflammation, if it oc|cupied either of tho&s;e parts, &s;hould not affect the next points of the ve&s;&s;els in the other.

When the &s;ame acid has ari&s;en, it continues to encrea&s;e all debility that happens to be predominant, either in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, or in the re&s;t of the body: And, while it exerts that operation over the whole body, its influence is in the part where it exi&s;ts, and where the diminution of the force of the di&s;ea&s;e is mo&s;t wanted.</P>
<P>CXCIII.

This remark applies likewi&s;e to worms, for the cure of which no bounds were &s;et to the u&s;e of purgatives, upon the idea of clearing away the &s;tuff in which this vermin ne&s;tled; a practice not &s;o judicious as that of &s;ome fooli&s;h boys, who place their &s;ucce&s;s in bird-catching upon the chance of bringing down the ne&s;ts from the top of high trees, by throwing &s;ticks and &s;tones at them; while other boys, both more &s;en&s;ible and alert, climb up and &s;eize every one of them. The cau&s;e of worms is the &s;ame as that of all the other di&s;ea&s;es we have &s;poken of, differing in nothing but in what they all differ from each other, mere degree. Debility over all, but prevalent in the alimentary canal, occa&s;ions a weakne&s;s both in all the other functions, and particularly in that of the peri&s;taltic motion. This &s;tate implies a &s;imilar weakne&s;s in the ve&s;&s;els that pour their fluids into that cavity; their weakne&s;s implies an enlargement of their diame|ters, and that enlargement an encrea&s;e of the quantity of fluids thrown in, without any encrea&s;ed impul&s;e behind. Hence ari&s;es a colluvies of matter, which the encrea&s;ed peri&s;taltic motion is not able to throw off. The colluvies is encrea&s;ed by the u&s;e of vegetable matter and fruit taken into the &s;tomach, and depo&s;iting their feculent parts on the inte&s;tines. The indication of cure is not to encrea&s;e either the general, or particu|lar part of the cau&s;e, by purging, and the u&s;e of other debilitating pow|ers, but to &s;trengthen the whole living &s;y&s;tem; and e&s;pecially the inte&s;|tinal canal, by the whole round of &s;timulant remedies diffu&s;ible or dura|ble. To this treatment the tabes and atrophia will yield in a few days, or even hours; the worms in as many weeks. And they are all increa&s;ed by the common plan of cure, as univer&s;al experience has proved to a demon&s;tration.</NOTE>,

The univer&s;al rule, &s;ugge&s;ted by the principles, and confirmed by the practice of this new doctrine, is to invigorate the whole &s;y&s;tem, and apply any diffu&s;ible &s;timulus, particularly laudanum, to the pained parts. By that practice I know not one cure, of &s;ome hundreds, that either I or my pupils have performed, that has failed. The gout will &s;ometimes make its attack in this way.

A young lady, with whom I am nearly and tenderly con|nected, has been often affected with an acute pain in her right &s;ide, mo&s;t|ly fixed and &s;olitary, &s;ometimes accompanied with a certain numbne&s;s and &s;en&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s in her extremeties, commonly with l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s of appetite, and &s;ome degree of head-ach. The effectual method of cure is to apply rags dipped in ladanum, volatile alkali, or aether, and renew them as often as they become dry, and to &s;upport her internally with durable and diffu&s;ible &s;timuli, proportioned in kind and quantity to the exigenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the ca&s;e. This method of cure of a morbid affection, that upon the contrary debilitating evacuant plan would be readily and quickly con|verted into an incurable a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;e, has always proved infallible in removing the attacks, which never after return but when &s;he has enfee|bled her&s;elf by keeping the hou&s;e too much, and neglecting air, exerci&s;e, and the u&s;e of the other diffu&s;ible &s;timuli. Friction u&s;ed over all the af|fected parts, is al&s;o found u&s;eful in &s;upporting the &s;timulant operation of all the other remedies. There is in the fens of Lincoln, where an e|minent phy&s;ician, and follower of this doctrine, practi&s;es, a di&s;ea&s;e call|ed a ba&s;tard peripneumony; in which, though it had always baffled all the efforts of the common evacuant practice, he never lo&s;t a patient, by exerci&s;ing the contrary one.</NOTE>.

CXCVIII. Symptoms of di&s;turbance occur al&s;o in a&s;|thenic di&s;ea&s;es as well as the &s;thenic. Such a &s;tate of di&s;|turbance takes place in the alimentary canal in the ca&s;es of hy&s;teria, colic, dy&s;pep&s;y, and the gout. Thus in the alimentary canal, be&s;ides the pains, mentioned above, a certain &s;en&s;e of burning, angui&s;h, contortion and direful torture, <HI>exhibit a &s;et of appearances,</HI> formidable in the high|e&s;t degree, both to the patient and by-&s;tanders, and which beget a &s;u&s;picion of their proceeding from inflammation as their cau&s;e. But tho&s;e affections have nothing to do with inflammation as their cau&s;e, and that they depend upon a &s;tate of the part quite the rever&s;e, has been proved by the the &s;timulant method of curing them turning out &s;ucce&s;sful in every in&s;tance in which it has been tried<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Till this doctrine appeared, it was impo&s;&s;ible to era&s;e from the minds of phy&s;icians an impre&s;&s;ion that had been deeply made there, that, nothing but the only inflammation, that they were acquainted with, could be the cau&s;e of &s;uch pain and torture, as is de&s;cribed in the text. I have more than once experienced the whole concour&s;e, here mention|ed, and have always found them to yield to the mo&s;t &s;timulant method of cure, that I could contrive. I once laboured under this modification of a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;e for no le&s;s than ten days, and was always able to over|come it in two hours, and procure an interval of complete ea&s;e and re|lief for the re&s;t of the day. The remedies employed were the whole round of diffu&s;ible &s;timuli, as opiates in all their forms, camphor, mu&s;k, volatile alkali, and aether, &amp;c. By the&s;e the functions for the time were completely re&s;tored. But their &s;timulant effect was no &s;ooner perfectly gone off, that is, after the interpo&s;ition of a long &s;leep, through the night, than the &s;ymptoms returned with a violence little &s;hort of what it had been the day before. This was proof po&s;itive, that their nature was a&s;thenic, or con&s;i&s;ting in debility; &s;ince they yielded to &s;timulant reme|dies; and that the debility was exqui&s;itely great, &s;ince it required &s;o high a degree of &s;timulant operation to remove it. While that is the undoubted fact, there is a nicety with re&s;pect to proportion to be attend|ed to in this ca&s;e. It is a rule, that the degree of curative means, whe|ther in the cure of &s;thenic or a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, &s;hould be accommodated to the degree of the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate or degree of the cau&s;e. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little of the curative means is employed a proportional part of the di&s;ea&s;e will remain: if too much, the di&s;ea&s;e will be more than removed, that is, another &s;tate which may be morbid in another extreme, may take place. Too much was once employed in this affection, and the effect was, that the di&s;ea&s;e was not eradicated till the tenth day of its cour&s;e from the beginning.</NOTE>. The &s;ame
<PB N="114" REF="022373_0128_0FB86AA9160A5198">
fact is confirmed by the u&s;e of wine, opium and other diffu&s;ible &s;timuli. After that, and &s;till in conjunction with their u&s;e, animal &s;oups, and next &s;olid meat, and the u&s;ual way of living, and guarding again&s;t debility, effectually re-e&s;tabli&s;h the healthy &s;tate<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">The rule here is, if indirect debility be the cau&s;e, to begin with a high degree of &s;timulant cure, and gradually reduce it to the ordinay de|gree that is &s;ufficient for the healthy &s;tate. And the caution is to be &s;ure of this gradual reduction, otherwi&s;e the indirect debility will be liable to return the moment the effect of the &s;timuli is gone off. By an attention of this kind a di&s;ea&s;e depending upon indirect debility may be cured in in the &s;ixth part of the time, that would be taken up by the cure, when the remedies are every day carried beyond the due bounds. For exam|ple, if the indirect debility be in the table the effect of an application of 71 degrees of exciting power in&s;tead of 40, that is to &s;ay, the excitement is worn down to 9 in&s;tead of being up at 40; it is evident, that an appli|cation of 71 degrees by way of remedies, will leave the di&s;ea&s;e where it was. Suppo&s;e only 65 degrees of &s;timulant power admini&s;tered; the ex|citement will fall to 66 and the wa&s;ted excitability ri&s;e to 15. Next day let only a degree of exciting power as 60 be applied; then the degree of excitement will be that number, and that of excitability 20. Five degrees of exciting power &s;till le&s;s will reduce the morbid excitement to 55, and rai&s;e the excitability to 25. And &s;o on may the matter go, till the excitability is rai&s;ed to 40 and the excitement reduced to the &s;ame number. But, if the reduction be much le&s;s by the day, the cure will be proportionally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lower.

life, al&s;o the highe&s;t degree of failure in the intellectual function, that is, delirium, among other in&s;tances of im|paired function, &s;hould take place.

CCXXI. Heat is not peculiar to &s;thenic pyrexiae<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Pyrexia is the word for &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es affecting the pul&s;e, called febrile, or fevers, very improperly, while the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erm fever is re&s;erved for the high a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es that have been confounded with the pyrexiae.</NOTE>, but belongs al&s;o to other di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ame &s;tamp. Nor is it &s;o confined to tho&s;e, as not al&s;o to ari&s;e in all the degrees of predi&s;po&s;ition to tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, and in proportion to each degree<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">That heat takes place in predi&s;po&s;ition, is a matter of daily ob&s;er|vation. Thus, when a per&s;on has no other &s;ymptom of di&s;ea&s;e, it is of|ten remarked, &s;ometimes by him&s;elf, &s;ometimes by another, who may have happened to feel his hands, that he is certainly not quite well as his hands are hot. When this heat happens, either in the hands or feet, without any cau&s;e to account for it con&s;i&s;tently with health, it is a &s;ure prelude of di&s;ea&s;e, that is, a &s;ure mark of a con&s;iderable predi&s;po&s;ition to to di&s;ca&s;e: and the kind of di&s;ea&s;e, of which it is the harbinger, is of|tener a&s;thenic than &s;thenic.</NOTE>. But the matter does not end here. The &s;ame heat di&s;tingui&s;hes all a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, whether fe|brile, which is a di&s;tinction without any good meaning, or not <HI>febrile,</HI> and al&s;o the predi&s;po&s;itions to them all, and <HI>that</HI> in proportion to the degree of debility.

<P>CCXXII. The heat is then only natural, when neither diathe&s;is is pre&s;ent. From that <HI>point</HI> it encrea&s;es, through all the degrees of encrea&s;ed excitement, till indirect debi|lity, from exce&s;s of &s;timulus, is e&s;tabli&s;hed; and it en|crea&s;es in proportion to the degree of excitement, rendering the per&s;piratory ve&s;&s;els always le&s;s and le&s;s patulous.

to certain boundaries, which are fixed by a cau&s;e by-and-by to be explained, <HI>and encrea&s;es</HI> in proportion to the degree of decrea&s;ing excitement, though the latter all along renders the per&s;piratory ve&s;&s;els more patulous; and, thereby, among other effects, dimini&s;hes the motion, both of all the ve&s;&s;els, and particularly of the per&s;piratory.</P>
<P>CCXXIII. When the heat has now been the greate&s;t it can be, and the debility encrea&s;ed in proportion, at la&s;t in the extremities, and afterwards gradually in the re&s;t of the body, cold, which is always a bad &s;ign, &s;ucceeds to it. In the progre&s;s of the debility motion begins to be very languid, fir&s;t in the extreme ve&s;&s;els of the extremities of the limbs, and then to be de&s;troyed altogether. Hence, as heat, whether in due proportion, or in exce&s;s, depends upon the motion of the blood and other fluids, being per|formed in due proportion, in exce&s;s, or to a certain extent, in a deficient degree; if, therefore, the heat is either no|thing, or next to nothing, as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the effect, together with the cau&s;e, by an univer&s;al law in nature, cea&s;es. The &s;ame thing happens in both extremes of ex|citability, that is, of exce&s;&s;ive abundance in direct, and of nearly a ce&s;&s;ation of it, in indirect debility; and &s;o much more <HI>readily will this happen,</HI> becau&s;e, whatever be its &s;ource, debility is always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>CCXXIV. Becau&s;e the excitement in &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es is for the mo&s;t part much and equally encrea&s;ed over the whole body; the heat, on that account, is al&s;o equally diffu&s;ed over the whole. From which fact no ca&s;es are excepted, but tho&s;e, in which, in certain parts, as the &s;tomach, under a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to vomiting, and, therefore in danger of falling into indirect debility, indi|rect debility either actually takes place, from the di&s;ea&s;e proceeding with an exce&s;&s;ive force of &s;timulus; or direct debility comes on, when the debilitating plan of cure has been pu&s;hed beyond the rule. But, &s;o long as the &s;thenic

<P>CCXXV. The &s;ame thing happens in moderate de|bility. Accordingly, through the whole cour&s;e of predi&s;|po&s;ition, and in tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, where the matter has not gone &s;o far as almo&s;t a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ce&s;&s;ation of motion, the heat is pretty equal. The effect of ce&s;&s;ation of motion has been explained<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">See above, CCXXIII.</NOTE>, But, before that happens, if any ine|quality of heat occurs in di&s;ea&s;es of moderate debility, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> frequently the ca&s;e in the hands and feet; the rea&s;on of that is, that a greater degree of debility as in cold, la|bour, and &s;weat from the&s;e, or any other &s;ource, and that &s;weat cold and clammy, has been applied to tho&s;e parts, than to others. Not only in the gout, but al&s;o in other affections both of direct and indirect debility, a burning heat, chiefly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the &s;oles of the feet, torments the patient, e&s;pecially in walking. That that ari&s;es from debility, checking per&s;piration, is proved by fatigue, cold, and other debilitating powers proving hurtful to it; and heat, re&s;t, and other &s;timulant powers, giving it ea&s;e.</P>
<P>CCXXVI. It remains now, that it be explained, how too great excitement, in high &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, impairs &s;ome functions, but never, by debilitating operation; and how too &s;mall an excitement in violent a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, gives an appearance of encrea&s;ing &s;ome functions, but always a fal&s;e one.</P>
<P>CCXXVII. If, in peripneumony, &s;y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ocha<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">or the inflammatory fever.</NOTE>, and violent rheumati&s;m, the voluntary motion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> are impaired, <HI>and</HI> to &s;uch a degree, that a per&s;on can neither u&s;e his hands nor his feet, more than a paralytic per&s;on; that that is not owing to debility, that is, dimini&s;hed excitement whether directly or indirectly<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">When the excitement is at 40 all the functions are performed in the be&s;t and complete&s;t manner. Above that there is more force through all the &s;teps of predi&s;po&s;ition, but with le&s;s durability and &s;teadine&s;s; which is exemplified by the compari&s;on of hard labourers, who at the &s;ame time are well &s;upported, and gentlemen, who live well, without u&s;ing a proportionable degree of labour or exerci&s;e to prevent a luxuriant &s;tate of vigour. When two &s;uch per&s;ons are &s;ubjected to a comparative trial of their vigour in any exertion, the former will be found to go through the exertion with more &s;teadine&s;s, and to hold out longer and better than the other; even though his fir&s;t efforts may have been inferior in force to tho&s;e of his antagoni&s;t. And the rea&s;on is evident; a moderate and proper degree of vigour, will bear an addition of &s;timulant operation longer than a higher degree of it approaching to morbid &s;tate; becau&s;e the di&s;tance of the excitement from indirect debility, which puts an end to excitement, is greater in the former than in the latter ca&s;e. The dif|ference in the well-&s;upported labourer is 30 before he can reach an en|crea&s;e that leads up to 70; whereas that of the gentleman is perhaps not more than 20. The exertion in the &s;truggle adds &s;timulus; which will be better borne by him who has lea&s;t and yet enough, than by him who has more, but of a &s;uperfluous degree, and more liable to run into the extreme of a ce&s;&s;ation of excitement. The effect of the exertion in the labourer will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> carry him &s;oon up, by its &s;timulant operation, to the degree of excitement where the gentleman began, &s;uppo&s;e that to be 50, and perhaps by and by to 60. But the &s;ame &s;timulus of exertion in the gentleman will have the effect of fir&s;t mounting up to 60, and by and by to 70, where the excitement begins to cea&s;e.</NOTE>, is evident from this double proof;

The part of it called lock-jaw is frequently a &s;ymptom in fevers. But the di&s;ea&s;e is more frequent in warmer countries than this, as in the &s;outh of Europe, where the ex|ce&s;s of heat is liable to run into indirect debility.

The healthy and vigorous &s;tate of motion con&s;i&s;ts not in the degree of contraction, but within certain degree of that, in the well proportioned alternation between contraction and relaxation; of which we have proof indi&s;puta|ble in this mode of motion being be&s;t performed in that middle &s;tate of vigour, that intervenes betwixt the extreme of the healthy, or moderate|ly encrea&s;ed vigour, and the other extreme of direct and indirect debi|lity. The encrea&s;e of vigour and excitement keep pace to a certain ex|tent, even through &s;ome degrees of morbid exce&s;s of the latter: but a period, and that &s;hort of indirect debility, arrives, as in peripneumony, where the excitement is encrea&s;ed beyond the healthy &s;tate, and mu&s;t be reduced in order to re&s;tore the due healthy vigour. There are other ca|&s;es, as that of mania, or &s;thenic in&s;anity, where the conjoined encrea&s;e of vigour and excitement will &s;till go further. But in every ca&s;e the en|crea&s;e of vigour, &s;till judging of it from its effects in the healthy &s;tate, cea&s;es before that of excitement; and, perhaps, we may make a &s;tep to|wards finding the boundary, by ob&s;erving, that the greater the &s;um total of exce&s;s of exciting power is, the &s;ooner does the point arrive, beyond which the vigour does not proceed. In peripneumony it cea&s;es at a cer|tain period of the di&s;ea&s;e, where the &s;alutary effect of bleeding and other debilitating means &s;hows that the encrea&s;e of excitement is &s;till going on. But here the &s;um total of excitement, con&s;idering the &s;tate of all the other functions, is greater than in mania, where the function chiefly encrea&s;ed in vigour is only that of voluntary motion, while all the functions of in|voluntary motion are very little affected. From this inve&s;tigation we can clearly di&s;cern, that every encrea&s;e of excitement leads to a morbid encrea&s;e of vigour, and that there is, &s;omewhere or other, a point in the &s;cale of encrea&s;ing excitement, and below the point of indirect debility, where the vigour is no further encrea&s;ed; and this inference ari&s;es with re&s;pect to the practice, that we &s;hould be very ob&s;ervant of both facts, as pointing out a very material di&s;tinction in the indications of cure; that in indirect debility being to &s;timulate, while that at the ce&s;&s;ation of vigour is to continue to debilitate till the &s;um total of exce&s;&s;ive vigour be redu|ced to the proper and healthy. The inability to the performance of motion in peripneumony is an in&s;tance of the latter; that of the conver|&s;ion of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e from exce&s;s of debilitating cure is an in&s;tance of the former.</NOTE></P>

To apply this to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the &s;tomach can|not be healthy, or under a predi&s;po&s;ition to &s;thenic &s;tate, and there by take in and dige&s;t, with the help of the other dige&s;tive organs, too much of the matter, from which blood is made; while the per&s;piratory ve&s;|&s;els are too weak to perform their function of throwing off their excre|mentitious matter.

To promote the mo&s;t perfect health all the exciting powers mu&s;t be applied, each in its due proportion.

In the former there is a certain latitude of the &s;trength of the &s;tomach; in the latter, and e&s;pecially when debility is the cau&s;e, there is a pro&s;tration of &s;trength. In fine, it is an univer&s;al and con&s;tant effect of all debility, to produce a deficiency of the fluids in the internal parts of the &s;y&s;tem with a relaxation of the ve&s;&s;els over all, e&s;pecially about their excretory terminations, and a di&s;charge of the fluids by &s;ome out-lets. The death, that happens, during the time of an entertainment, is not to be imputed to an over proportion of blood, which cannot happen in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time.

A gentleman, under or about the thirtieth year of his age, had been ten days in a typhus fever, occa&s;ioned by extreme cold, &s;uc|ceeding to the debilitating effects left upon his habit by too great mode|ration in his diet, and, certainly, not a good choice of the different arti|cles of it.

Both in per&s;ons liable to the gout, and other a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, &s;ometimes of direct and at other times of indirect debility, and e&s;pecially in tho&s;e who have been much expo&s;ed to cold, without the debilitating effect of the cold being over|come (vide par. CXXII), by an alternation with, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of, heat, and in very many old people, e&s;pecially among the poorer &s;ort, who have been, and naturally are, much expo&s;ed to various debilitating powers, there is often, e&s;pecially in winter, a very great cough and ex|pectoration.

When the debility of the di&s;ea&s;e is of the in|direct kind, in which the cure is more difficult, there is, &s;till, as little rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive of the pulmonary or any other local affection. For the cure of it al&s;o proves the contrary. In it the means of cure are to change the forms of &s;timulus, and to proceed from the u&s;e of the &s;tronger to that of the weaker, till at length the patient can do without much of the very &s;trong ones. (See above, par. XCIX. and tho&s;e that follow). When the di&s;ea&s;e cannot be overcome in that way, the excitability mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be worn out, and life come to its end; but &s;till from general debility, not local di&s;ea&s;e. For, if ever any lo|cal affection does appear, it is always the la&s;t effect, not the primary cau&s;e. In this way I lo&s;t two gentlemen, after having been able to &s;up|port them for many weeks, when the progno&s;is upon the common prac|tice did not allow them as many hours. The cau&s;e of their indirect de|bility had been hard drinking. But even in tho&s;e, who die of a con|firmed con&s;umption, there is not often rea&s;on for the &s;u&s;picion of tuber|cles in the lungs.

When a per&s;on is in&s;ufficiently excited with re&s;pect to that &s;timulus, and ri&s;es not, &s;uppo&s;e, above 30&deg; in his excitement, a gla&s;s carries him up 2&deg;, another 2&deg; more, and &s;o forth, till after five gla&s;&s;es, and their effect in carrying him up to 40&deg;, he finds him&s;elf well and vigorous in all his functions. But, &s;till, we are not &s;o flim&s;ily made, as not to bear a little of what is either too much or too little. Suppo&s;e him then to take five gla&s;&s;es more, and, con&s;equently, to be rai&s;ed to 50&deg;, or 10&deg; above the &s;tandard. As his &s;pirits, his intellectual, and all his other, functions, were low, while his excitement remained below 40&deg;, &s;o they are all proportionably exalted by the time that his excite|ment is elevated to 50&deg;. Let him &s;till go on, and his intellectual func|tion will ri&s;e &s;till higher; he will now di&s;play the full extent of his ge|nius: his pa&s;&s;ions and emotions, of whatever kind, will ri&s;e in the &s;ame proportion; he will, in one word, be an example of the effects of Alex|ander's fea&s;t. Suppo&s;e, to bring him to all this he has &s;wallowed, be|&s;ides tho&s;e he had before, other five gla&s;&s;es. Let him go on, till he has taken five gla&s;&s;es more, and we &s;hall &s;ee the effect: In the cour&s;e of time, employed in taking the&s;e, he gradually falls off in his &s;pirits, in his intellectual, and in his corporeal, functions; his tongue, his feet, his eyes, his memory, his judgment, all, fail him; he, at la&s;t, becomes drow|&s;y, and then falls fa&s;t a-&s;leep. The &s;ame is the progre&s;s of excitement as it ari&s;es from labour or exerci&s;e through the day, whether of mind or body. The &s;ame is the effect of the &s;timulus of eating, e&s;pecially nou|ri&s;hing &s;timulant things, and in great plenty. Before dinner, the occu|pations of the former part of the day, are not yet &s;ufficient to prepare one for &s;leep; which, however, after a heavy dinner, will, unle&s;s the in|terference of &s;ome other &s;timulus prevent it, very readily happen to mo&s;t people, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e, who&s;e frailty, from age or any other cau&s;e, renders them more liable to be fatigued by the pa&s;t operations of the day than others. The younger and more vigorous will be able to hold out to the end of the day; when they too, after having undergone the degree of &s;timulus nece&s;&s;ary to give that wa&s;te of excitability that di&s;po&s;es to &s;leep, will be overcome by it. The very flow of the blood in the ve&s;&s;els, and the exerci&s;e of the involuntary motions, that keep it up, tend at la&s;t to the &s;ame effect. The &s;ame thing applies to the motion con&s;tantly going on in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, as well as the motions that occur in all the &s;ecretory and excretory &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. Light, &s;timu|lating the eyes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, the ears, and the &s;everal &s;ub&s;tances that act upon the organs of the other three &s;en&s;es, all, tend, by wa&s;ting the ex|citability, to wear down the excitement to that point in the &s;cale where &s;leep commences. And the proce&s;s, in every ca&s;e, is, fir&s;t a low, then a higher and higher, then the highe&s;t, vigour of all the functions; which, again, gradually falls till its termination in &s;leep.

The admini&s;tration of the opiate repeated in &s;mall do&s;es till the effect took place, kept him awake. Some time after, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame lingering di&s;ea&s;e, when he had not yet acquired any permanent &s;trength, but was only better &s;upported by the diffu&s;ible and other &s;timuli, than he had been till I was called in, his predominant &s;ymptom came to be great watchfulne&s;s, which was partly the effect of a certain, though not a great, degree of excitement that the tincture and other cordial powers had given him.

<P>CCXLVI. The&s;e are the times and circum&s;tances of the body in which opium produces &s;leep.

In one word, through all the intermediate degrees of excitement from direct to indirect debility, opium is by far the mo&s;t powerful of all the agents, and as &s;uch mu&s;t be mo&s;t hurtful in &s;thenic di|athe&s;is, becau&s;e, when added to the other &s;timulant pow|ers, it not only bani&s;hes &s;leep, but is liable to precipitate tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es from the &s;thenic &s;tate to indirect debility, and from this la&s;t to death.</P>
<P>CCXLVII. That the debility, upon which coma de|pends, is le&s;s than that which &s;upports morbid vigilance,

<HEAD>The Cure of both the Diathe&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>CCLI. As the cau&s;e of both the diathe&s;es is that which has been formerly<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See above, par. CXLVIII.</NOTE> related; the indication of cure, therefore, to be taken from that is, in the &s;thenic diathe&s;is to dimini&s;h exce&s;&s;ive excitement over the whole &s;y&s;tem; in the a&s;thenic to encrea&s;e deficient excitement <HI>likewi&s;e over all the &s;y&s;tem,</HI> till it be brought to that degree, which proves the cau&s;e of health.</P>
<P>CCLII. The remedies that produce that effect in <HI>the cure of</HI> &s;thenic diathe&s;is, are the powers, which, when their &s;timulant operation is exce&s;&s;ive, produce that very diathe&s;is, in this ca&s;e, acting with that &s;light and reduced force of &s;timulus, by which they produce le&s;s excitement than health requires, or by which they prove debilita|ting.</P>
<P>CCLIII. The powers which produce the &s;ame effect in the a&s;thenic diathe&s;is, are tho&s;e that, when their &s;timu|lus is &s;mall, produce that diathe&s;is, <HI>in this ca&s;e,</HI> exciting with that high degree of &s;timulus, by means of which they give more excitement, than &s;uits the healthy &s;tate, or by means of which they &s;timulate.</P>
<P>CCLIV. In the &s;thenic diathe&s;is that temperature<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"> The &s;ame order is followed here, that has all along been ob&s;er|ved, to wit, that of the enumeration of the powers in par. XI. and XIII. and that of the explanation of them, when viewed as the hurtful powers producing either diathe&s;is in Chap. I. Part II. and it will be kept to throughout the whole work. Nothing can be more &s;imple and natural, and better &s;uit the &s;implicity of the &s;ubject, while nothing is more artifi|cial and arbitrary than the arrangements either of Sy&s;tematics or No&s;o|logi&s;ts. Ju&s;t order could never be expected from an erroneous and confu|&s;ed view of the &s;ubject to be treated of; while a clear conception of the &s;ubject as a whole, infallibly leads to a di&s;tinct di&s;tributi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the &s;everal parts that compo&s;e it; &s;o that what Horace &s;ays of language, equally ap|plies to order, and the &s;ame thing applies here as to his <HI>Verba &amp; lucidus ordo.

which is called heat, mu&s;t by all means be avoided; <HI>and</HI> for this <HI>very good</HI> rea&s;on, that the only degree of it which proves debilitating, that is the exce&s;&s;ive to an ex|treme, cannot be carried to that height, in which it de|bilitates, without the ri&s;k of hurtful or pernicious con&s;e|quence from the exce&s;s of &s;timulus<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"> See above, par. CXV. Though very inten&s;e heat relaxes the &s;imple and induces atony on the living &s;olids, who, in a peripneumony, would think of u&s;ing it with that view?

The addition, therefore, of more &s;timulus from the application of heat, would en&s;ure that effect, and thereby occa&s;ion the conver&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e into a much wor&s;e one, &s;uch as hydrotho|rax, or the drop&s;y of the brea&s;t.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CCLV. But, when the diathe&s;is, and its cau&s;e the en|crea&s;ed &s;timulus, is gentle in the actual di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate, there is no occa&s;ion for forbidding that degree of heat, which accompanies <HI>the operation of</HI> &s;weating and pediluvi|um<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"> Pediluvium is the warm bath of the legs and feet.</NOTE>; becau&s;e the wa&s;te of fluids in the former, and the agreeable &s;en&s;ation in the latter, promi&s;e &s;omewhat more advantage, than the moderate <HI>degree of</HI> heat <HI>employed in this ca&s;e</HI> threatens di&s;advantage.</P>

<P>CCLVIII.

Its proper generic name is pyrex|ia. See above par. LXVIII. where that appellation is a&s;&s;igned to it: an appellation to avoid mi&s;taking its nature, that &s;hould be accurately attended to. Great mi&s;chief has been occa&s;ioned by this vague term. Thus when a per&s;on is &s;aid to be affected with a di&s;ea&s;e; when it is a&s;ked what di&s;ea&s;e it is, and the an&s;wer given, that it is a fever, immediately bleeding is thought of, though that, and every, evacuation is as hurt|ful in proper fever as it may be &s;erviceable in the pyrexia. To give an example of this pyrexia, the particular appellation for which is &s;ynocha, or &s;thenic pyrexial di&s;ea&s;e; many years ago, a per&s;on in the old town of Edinburgh, labouring under it, e&s;caped the vigilance of his nur&s;e; flew naked out of the hou&s;e in a very keen fro&s;t with &s;now upon the ground, acro&s;s the &s;treets, pa&s;&s;ed over into the new town, and from that to the fields beyond it.

From which, and a prodigi|ous number of facts to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, all concuring in the proof of the debilitating operation of cold, there can hardly ari&s;e a doubt in the mind, that in a certain high degree, if it could be conveniently u&s;ed, or if there were occa&s;ion to have recour&s;e to it for want of efficacious reme|dies, it would at once remove the highe&s;t degree of &s;thenic &s;tate that e|ver occurs in di&s;ea&s;e, and reduce the excitement from the neare&s;t ap|proach to 70 down to 40. Nay it might run into the oppo&s;ite extreme and go all the way to death. But we &s;hall, by and by, have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that we are &s;o well provided with effectual remedies as not to be under any temptation of &s;training this to its height. And we &s;hall al&s;o find that a number of remedies in a moderate degree are preferable to any one, or to a &s;maller number in a higher degree.

For, &s;ince in &s;light &s;thenic affecti|ons much nouri&s;hing food, and in them all, too much, can be taken; the con&s;equence of that mu&s;t be, that, however much the quantity of the blood and other fluids has been dimini&s;hed, if the food, which is the only <HI>power</HI> that can produce blood, continues to be taken, all the ve&s;&s;els, in proportion to the quantity that has been taken, will a|gain go on to be filled, and to be fired with the fewel of exce&s;&s;ive excitement. To prevent which inconvenience, and to dimini&s;h excitement, &s;till with greater equality over the &s;y&s;tem; ab&s;tinence, or an allowance of vegetable mat|ter in a fluid form, and watery drink, will have a very great effect.

For, if, after taking all the precautions and &s;ecurities that have been recommended, the degree of heat, that proves hurt|ful from its &s;timulus, be allowed to approach the external &s;urface of the body; it will produce another inequality of excitement, however much that may have been properly and equally dimini&s;hed by the other means of cure. Where|fore, as the &s;thenic diathe&s;is depends &s;o much upon the &s;ti|mulus of heat, directly affecting the &s;kin<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">See par.

Hence I found, that all the theories rai&s;|ed upon that hypothe&s;is of cour&s;e fell to the ground. Indeed the fact is quite con&s;i&s;tent with every one here.</NOTE>.

<P>CCCLXIX. And, as no effect, except &s;thenic diathe|&s;is, follows it, and the hurtful powers, that otherwi&s;e u|&s;ually produce that diathe&s;is, always precede it, and an a&s;thenic or debilitating plan of cure always, and only, &s;uc|ceeds <HI>in removing it,</HI> and con&s;equently its effect no ways differs from the di&s;ea&s;es hitherto mentioned; it is, there|fore, with ju&s;tice, that the di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from it, are con|joined with tho&s;e others, as belonging to the &s;ame form.</P>
<P>CCCLXX. Betwixt them there is only this difference, that in the exanthematic ca&s;es of &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;e, the mat|ter requires &s;ome time to pa&s;s out of the body, <HI>which time is</HI> different in different ca&s;es: and it pa&s;&s;es out more copiou&s;|ly

But, con&s;idering how many facts in medical writings I have found fal&s;e, the effect of that on my mind, is to render the weight of te&s;timony in favour of the various internal vi&s;ce|ra being &s;o liable to be inflamed, from this &s;uppo&s;ed &s;triking in of the mea&s;ly eruption, very light, and to di&s;po&s;e me to doubt of the fact alto|gether: Which I am the more inclined to do, from the analogy of a broad fact in direct contradiction to it: Which is, that the inflamma|tion, depending upon the general diathe&s;is in &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, never, as I have yet found, affects an interior part. (See par. CXIII. CLXVIII.) Neither is inflammation, from any other &s;ource, near &s;o frequent in inter|nal parts as vulgar opinion has taught us. Di&s;&s;ection has &s;hown inflam|mation in the inte&s;tinal canal in dy&s;entery, or what is called in English the bloody flux. But that only happened under the evacuant, debilita|ting, vegetable, plan of cure: and, even in that ca&s;e, &s;eems to have been an ultimate, not an early, effect, much le&s;s a cau&s;e. And it has been &s;hown, that what has been con&s;idered as a burning inflammation in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, is not an inflammation at all. (See above par. CXCVIII.) Nay, even when inflammation does happen internally, it is never of the &s;thenic, but always of the general, or local, a&s;thenic kind, and, when quickly cured, cannot be inflammation. If there be any truth in the frequency of inflammation towards the end of the mea&s;les, it mu&s;t be of the a&s;thenic kind: Which is the more likely from its late appearance, and from a circum&s;tance that, though no where taken notice of, has great weight with me; which is, that as the di&s;tinct &s;mall pox pa&s;&s;es in|to the confluent, peripneumony into drop&s;y of the che&s;t, and any &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;e with its diathe&s;is, into any a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;e, and the diathe&s;is on which it depends; there is nothing in the nature of the animal oecono|my and of the powers acting on it, to prevent the &s;ame conver&s;ion of &s;thenic into a&s;thenic &s;tate in the mea&s;les. And if, which is mo&s;t proba|ble from the alexipharmac practice, that was then u&s;ed in this di&s;ea&s;e, indirect debility can induce &s;uch a change, no di&s;ea&s;e has a fuller chance for it than the mea&s;les.

CCCLXXXI.

Whether any thing like that is the con&s;equence of the mea&s;les, is not yet a&s;certained: But, as every exce&s;s of excitement, as in the conver&s;ion of peripneumony into a drop&s;y of the che&s;t, is liable to run into indirect debility, it is, therefore, &s;carce to be doubt|ed, but that the &s;ame thing happens to this di&s;ea&s;e, which is inferior to none in violence.</P>

<HEAD>The De&s;cription of the violent Ery&s;ipelas.</HEAD>
<P>CCCLXXXII. The violent Ery&s;ipelas is a phlegma&s;ia, always beginning with pyrexia, and followed by inflam|mation.

<P>CCCLXXXIV. The cau&s;e of the redne&s;s of the in|flammation, in this as well as in every ca&s;e, is an exce&s;&s;ive quantity of blood in the inflamed ve&s;&s;els; for the que&s;tion about the degree of redne&s;s is of no importance.

The &s;ame is the cau&s;e of the &s;low motion of the inflammation, and of the ine|quality of its edges. The &s;en&s;e of burning is owing to an acrimony <HI>of the contained fluid,</HI> acquired by &s;tagnation.</P>
<P>CCCLXXXV. The attack of the inflammation upon the face is not more dangerous than upon any other place, except when the diathe&s;is, upon which it depends, is great, rendering the inflammation proportionally great<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">See par.

His practice, even when right, was de&s;titute of principle: He had no &s;ort of compre|hen&s;ion of the doctrine of life as a whole, and as a department of know|ledge di&s;tinct from all others.

<P>CCCCIX. That the hoar&s;ene&s;s is owing to a &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of the vapour that &s;hould be exhaled into the bron|chia, may be known from this; that, when the hoar&s;ene&s;s has remained long, almo&s;t without expectoration and cough, or with a moderate degree of them, while the &s;thenic diathe&s;is continued in full force, and did not abate in the bronchia; upon the diathe&s;is giving way, and the expectoration and cough becoming more free, the hoar&s;e|ne&s;s abates, or goes off.

It was, therefore, a very unlucky mi&s;take, to think it aro&s;e from cold alone, and was to be cured by heat.

<P>CCCCXXXIII. The hurtful powers, that produce perviligium, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e, that produce mania, but inferior in force. It is evidently produced by hard thinking, commotion, or di&s;turbance of mind, in prefer|ence to other hurtful powers. The degree of thought, that has that effect, is not ultimately exce&s;&s;ive; for, if it were, by effecting a temporary wa&s;te of the excitability, it would produce &s;ound &s;leep; or if it repelled &s;leep, it could only act &s;o, by means of indirect debility, the con&s;ideration of which is foreign from this place<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">See CXLI.</NOTE>. And the &s;ame is the degree of di&s;turbance of feeling, that proves hurtful, in &s;o far as it produces this di&s;ea&s;e: Every ultimate exce&s;s of which<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">See CXLI.</NOTE>, either ends in &s;leep, or induces that vigilance, of which indirect debility is the cau&s;e. But it is not a &s;in|gle operation of the intellectual faculty, or of the &s;tate of any pa&s;&s;ion, or one that happens but rarely, that proves adequate to the effect. For the effect, in that ca&s;e, would be either too &s;light, or of too &s;hort continuance; to merit the title of di&s;ea&s;e. It is an often returning, or deeply af|fecting, irritation upon the brain, and, therefore; one that leaves a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion, which has any con&s;iderable force in producing this di&s;ea&s;e. In this la&s;t way, an eager, inordinate, and va&s;t de&s;ire for the attainment of high ob|jects of pur&s;uit, the impul&s;e that hurries on to the revenge of a great injury, and the horror that ari&s;es upon the per|petration of it, the fear of future puni&s;hment for crimes, are held up to us as productive of high commotion of mind, in the examples of Cataline, Ore&s;tes, and Francis Spira. As often, therefore, as the mind is &s;o excited in its ideas and pa&s;&s;ions, as not to be capable of being compo&s;ed to re&s;t and &s;ound &s;leep, after a certain &s;hort continuance of tho&s;e,

<P>CCCCXXXVI. As the powers &s;timulating vigour|&s;ly in this way<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See CCCCXXXIII.</NOTE>, and without any diminution of their &s;um of &s;timulating, produce pervigilium; from that we learn that the cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e is the &s;ame with that of the re&s;t of the &s;thenic form of di&s;ea&s;es<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">from CXLI to CXLVIII.</NOTE>, and that the &s;ame is the &s;tate of body in which every one of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es con&s;i&s;t: Nor is it under&s;tood, that different hurtful powers, but preci&s;ely the &s;ame, with only a variation in the proportion of their force, which often happens to other &s;thenic di&s;ea|&s;es precede <HI>this di&s;ea&s;e.</HI></P>

&s;o great as to be &s;ufficient to have any con&s;iderable effect on the heart and ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>CCCCXLI. But it happens to all tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, that both the&s;e la&s;t and all the other functions, get &s;omewhat above the &s;tandard of the &s;ound functions, and a great deal above a&s;thenic diathe&s;is. And the &s;thenic apyrexiae differ from the other &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es chiefly in this, that the ex|citing powers keep much within that degree <HI>of force,</HI> that wa&s;tes the excitability much; as is perceived from the proof of the effect; for they are di&s;ea&s;es of much longer &s;tanding than any other a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>CCCCXLII. From which fact, however, much the brain may be affected by its own proper &s;timuli; however great the quantity of blood in its ve&s;&s;els may be; unle&s;s to the excitement ari&s;ing from the&s;e, that <HI>excitement,</HI> which the other &s;timulant powers produce, be added, it is cer|tain, that the general effect will be much le&s;s, and that the united energy of all the powers has far more effect, than the &s;eparate force of any.</P>
<P>CCCCXLIII. The diathe&s;is, then, in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, is, upon the whole, le&s;s than in the re&s;t of the &s;thenic di&s;|ea&s;es; that of a part, as of the brain in mania and pervi|gilium, and of the blood-ve&s;&s;els in obe&s;ity, is pretty con&s;i|derable. The whole is in general as great as that in the predi&s;po&s;ition to the other di&s;ea&s;es, and exceeding its force in the labouring part. Hence it comes out, that, contra|ry to the nature of tho&s;e other di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;imilar to the predi&s;po&s;ition to them, they are u&s;ually of long &s;tanding and duration, and for this rea&s;on, that the mediocrity of the &s;um of &s;timulant operation never con&s;umes the excita|bility, and always produces too much excitement. The great tumult of &s;ymptoms in the brain and <HI>blood</HI>-ve&s;&s;els in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es does not imply a great &s;um of excitement, for this rea&s;on, that the affection of a part, however for|midable, compared with the affection of all the re&s;t of the
<PB N="255" REF="022373_0269_0FB8686D337B2B30">
body, is infinitely inferior in its degree<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">See par. XLIX. to LIII.</NOTE>. However much, then, any &s;timulus pre&s;&s;es upon a part, and from that &s;preads at large over the re&s;t of the body; unle&s;s, how|ever, other &s;timuli, applied to other parts, &s;u&s;tain its ope|ration, &s;o as that the &s;um of the operation of them all may deeply affect the whole body: the effect of the &s;olita|ry &s;timulus, making a figure in a part, will be le&s;s con&s;i|derable in the re&s;t of the body: In fine, it mu&s;t be kept in mind, that every violent di&s;ea&s;e always ari&s;es from the excitement which the united force of &s;everal &s;timuli has produced.</P>
<P>CCCCXLIV. In the&s;e &s;thenic apyrexiae, as a certain part, the brain in the two fir&s;t, and the blood ve&s;&s;els in the la&s;t<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">See par. CCCCXLIII.</NOTE>, is much more affected, and in greater propor|tion, than in the other &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, becau&s;e the affec|tion of the part is much le&s;s &s;upported by &s;timuli acting upon the other parts; &s;o the &s;timuli, acting in that way upon the labouring parts, are, however, under&s;tood to affect the re&s;t of the body, though le&s;s con&s;iderably. That this is the fact, is proved by there being <HI>in this ca&s;e,</HI> no a&s;thenic diathe&s;is, and evidently &s;uch a &s;thenic one, as up|holds the predi&s;po&s;ition to other di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;thenic form; by the remedies, which affect other parts, as it will by and by appear, being aiding in the cure here, and by powers of a contrary nature, always proving hurtful. Whence, it is an evident and certain truth, even here, where it might have been lea&s;t expected, that every &s;timulus that affects a part, affects the whole body, upon account of the excita|bility being one uniform, undivided, property over the whole.</P>
<P>CCCCXLV. With re&s;pect to obe&s;ity in particular; that the other hurtful powers, as well as food, have more or le&s;s effect, one may know from the certain fact of the
<PB N="256" REF="022373_0270_0FB8686EC7B8A388">
dige&s;tive powers, which depend upon the influence of the&s;e <HI>powers,</HI> being of &s;uch force and vigour, as to perform their function<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> more perfectly <HI>in fat per&s;ons,</HI> than in others, who are, neverthele&s;s, not by any means weak.

<P>CCCCXLVI. Thus pa&s;&s;ions are not with &s;uch per|&s;ons too &s;timulant; a circum&s;tance known to the generality of mankind, among whom it is an adage, that fat per&s;ons are commonly good natured<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">This mu&s;t be taken with more than grains of allowance; &s;ince &s;uch is the effect of the different motives to human action received from example and education, that the pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves are drawn into a &s;ub&s;erviency to every per&s;on's predominant pur&s;uit. I have known a per&s;on in Edinburgh get great credit for his integrity, though that was not extraordinary, from roughne&s;s of manners and an affectation of pa&s;|&s;ionatene&s;s, while the di&s;&s;imulation of that real di&s;po&s;ition is the more general engine among men of promoting their intere&s;t.

It is with propriety, then, that all the di&s;ea&s;es that have been treated of, have been reduced not fir&s;t to two genera, and after to &s;pecies, but, without regard either to genera or &s;pecies, only to two forms.</P>

La&s;tly, if the heat &s;hould happen to prove hurtful, if at any time the flow of the &s;weat &s;hould be attended with le&s;s relief, or with &s;ome in|convenience, it &s;hould be immediately &s;topped: For it was not for no purpo&s;e, but for that of making the reme|dies &s;upply the defects of one another, and of reducing the excitement more equally over the whole body, that a num|ber was recommended.</P>

In all the ca&s;es of a violent diathe&s;is, all the remedies that have been mentioned, are more or le&s;s, and differently on different occa&s;ions, in proportion as the remaining part of diathe&s;is may require, each in a larger or &s;maller quantity, to be brought into play, and the curative circle enlarged: And be&s;ides them,</P>

And, &s;ince the intention in bleeding is to prevent an ultimate exce&s;s of exciting power from
<PB N="276" REF="022373_0290_0FB8689A9C2035E8">
producing a ce&s;&s;ation of excitement in death, an event of which there is not the lea&s;t danger, in a moderate diathe&s;is, &s;uch as that, which is the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;es here in que&s;|tion; for that rea&s;on, the cure mu&s;t be adapted to the cau&s;e, and bleeding mu&s;t be either ab&s;tained from altogether, or very &s;paringly u&s;ed.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXXIII. It is not, therefore, only in di&s;ea&s;es of debility, which belong to the other form (in mo&s;t of which it has, neverthele&s;s, been, and &s;till is, the cu&s;tom, to &s;pill more or le&s;s of the vital fluid); but al&s;o in all the di&s;ea&s;es of this form, except the very violent ones, that the lancet is to be re&s;trained.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXXIV. Though in rheumati&s;m the diathe|&s;is often runs con&s;iderably high, the u&s;ual profu&s;e bleeding, is not, however, required. For, as every diathe&s;is is always greater in &s;ome parts than in any other equal one, &s;o it is with the &s;thenic diathe&s;is <HI>in this ca&s;e;</HI> which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound much greater upon the &s;urface of the body, than in any other equal &s;pace within. And the rea&s;on is, that the mo&s;t powerful noxious agent, heat, &s;ucceeding to cold, or &s;o alternating with it, that its own &s;timulus is encrea&s;ed by its effect<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">See XXXVII.</NOTE>, directs its principal energy to the &s;urface of the body. Hence, after exce&s;&s;ive bleeding, the di&s;ea&s;e, notwith&s;tand|ing, often ob&s;tinately recurs. The cau&s;e of which fact, if the principles of this doctrine be well under&s;tood, can|not be ob&s;cure. Bleeding dimini&s;hes the &s;thenic diathe&s;is chiefly in the red ve&s;&s;els, le&s;s in any of their extremities, lea&s;t of all in the per&s;piratory ve&s;&s;els, and tho&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of in the tract of the mu&s;cles; and &s;till le&s;s in the la&s;t, becau&s;e the operation of the bleeding is counteracted by that of heat: Which is an explanation confirmed by the certain te&s;timony of phy&s;icians; who often complain that their favorite remedy &s;ails them.</P>

CCCCLXXXV. Upon which account, &s;weating, which we &s;poke of <HI>&s;o</HI> lately, is remarkably adapted to <HI>she cure of</HI> this di&s;ea&s;e: To it, therefore, after a previous bleeding to twelve ounces, and ob&s;erving the rule of tem|perature and diet before directed, mu&s;t we have immediate recour&s;e, if the diathe&s;is happens to be con&s;iderably vio|lent, and is &s;ignalized by heat <HI>of the body,</HI> by pains raging mo&s;t in the night time, and by a &s;trong and hard pul&s;e.

<P><PB N="278" REF="022373_0292_0FB8689EB0BE5CF0">
CCCCLXXXVII. Often &s;o gentle a diathe&s;is occurs, that one or two of them, once or twice employed, is &s;uf|ficient for the cure: So &s;light a diathe&s;is that is, in which, unle&s;s for a little at fir&s;t, the &s;hivering, langour, and then heat, is very moderate, pointing out a proportional &s;light|ne&s;s of diathe&s;is upon the &s;urface; in which there is &s;carce any la&s;&s;itude, &s;howing the &s;ame moderation of diathe&s;is in the organs of voluntary motion; in which the vigour of the &s;tomach remains, manife&s;ting a moderate exce&s;s of ex|citement in it; in which, in fine, the other functions, o|ver the whole body are &s;ufficiently calm, and only &s;uffer con&s;picuou&s;ly in the labouring part: In the&s;e ca&s;es, often a &s;ingle purge with glauber's &s;alt, often, without that, cold, re&s;t, and ab&s;tinence, have conducted the morbid ex|citement to its &s;alutary degree. A thou&s;and times has the &s;thenic cynanche, a thou&s;and times has catarrh and the &s;imple &s;ynocha, nay ery&s;ipelas it&s;elf with affection of the face, been in that way removed. And the &s;carlet fever is often &s;o gentle as to yield to the &s;ame management.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXXVIII. In this way mu&s;t a con&s;tant re|gard be had to the degree of excitement and diathe&s;is in the method of cure, and often terms mu&s;t be di&s;regarded. For, as it was with this view, that the &s;imple &s;ynocha was before di&s;tingui&s;hed from the phrenitic, and the gen|tle ery&s;ipelas from the violent; &s;o, it often happens, that catarrh ri&s;es to that magnitude that threatens or brings on a peripneumony, and that the latter proceeds with much more gentlene&s;s than u&s;ual. In which circum&s;tances, it is the degree of excitement alone, that ought to govern the phy&s;ician, without re&s;pect to names.</P>
<P>CCCCLXXXIX. Another u&s;eful caution here is, to judge of the &s;tate of the pul&s;e, of the temperature upon the &s;kin, and of the &s;kin in other re&s;pects, with good &s;en&s;e, and due reflection upon the&s;e principles. The frequency of the pul&s;e in all &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es is moderate: With that
<PB N="279" REF="022373_0293_0FB868A069DC8D80">
there is conjoined &s;ome hardne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ulne&s;s. Whenever, therefore, the pul&s;e is very quick, it is to be &s;u&s;pected, that the &s;thenic diathe&s;is has pa&s;&s;ed into the a&s;thenic, the exce&s;&s;ive excitement into a ce&s;&s;ation of excitement, or that the di&s;ea&s;e has been &s;thenic from the beginning. To re|move which doubt and a&s;certain the truth, the habit of body, the age, mu&s;t be con&s;idered, and an enquiry be made to know, whether the di&s;ea&s;e has been preceded, or not, by contagion. Heat of the &s;kin is in common to the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es and fevers, which are di&s;ea&s;es of an opp&s;ite &s;tamp, and therefore a doubtful mark. Which, as it depends up|on an interruption of per&s;piration, from whatever &s;ource, is never to be &s;trained into a proof of the &s;tate of excite|ment. And, &s;ince dryne&s;s of the &s;kin, which is in com|mon to the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es however different from each o|ther, in the a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es depends upon debility; in order to know the amount of what that &s;ymptom means, the other &s;ymptoms and the exciting hurtful powers, &s;hould be con&s;idered. In fine, the only enquiry &s;hould be, whether the excitement is abundant or deficient, and all the &s;igns &s;hould be con&s;ulted with that view; nor are we to judge ra&s;hly of any peculiar form.</P>
<P>CCCCXC. When, therefore, the &s;igns, that have been related, are compared with all the re&s;t and with the diathe|&s;is, we are then to &s;et about the anti&s;thenic or &s;timulant plan of cure. The violent &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, which we fir&s;t con&s;idered can &s;carce be confounded with the contrary ones; the more gentle are daily confounded. But, while it is ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es re|&s;embling them; if, however, any per&s;on &s;hould think the <HI>marks of</HI> di&s;tinction ambiguous, let him know, that, up|on account of that gentlene&s;s, <HI>though the di&s;ea&s;e under exa|mination &s;hould</HI> be a&s;thenic, blood is not even to be let, much le&s;s <HI>under the apprehen&s;ion that they may turn out</HI> a&s;the|nic to which la&s;t &s;o debilitating a power is de&s;tructive, as

<P>CCCCXCVIII.

<PB N="285" REF="022373_0299_0FB86527169138C0">
by wearying and fatiguing the body, tends to indirect de|bility, is under&s;tood to be wanting. But, &s;ince, in con|&s;equence of u&s;ing the &s;ame food, both in quality and quantity, and the &s;ame <HI>indulgence in</HI> re&s;t <HI>and ca&s;e,</HI> &s;ome per|&s;ons become fat, others continue lean; from thence it is a&s;certained, that all the dige&s;tive powers have more force in the former, than in the latter, and con&s;equently, that the other exciting hurtful powers have contributed to the effect, and that a proportional excitement follows. Of the hurtful powers, that belong to this place, an ea&s;y ex|erci&s;e of the intellectual faculty, <HI>and</HI> tranquillity of mind, which are moderate &s;timuli, favour obe&s;ity; over &s;trained thinking, and habitual indulgence in pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as that of anger, <HI>the repetition of which con&s;titutes</HI> ill nature, oppo&s;e it. Corporeal motion, which dimini&s;hes the quantity of fluids in the &s;y&s;tem, and, as often as it is con|&s;iderable, proves fatiguing and debilitating, oppo&s;es it. Equally unfavourable to it is hard drinking; which, in a &s;imilar manner, wears out the excitement, by con&s;tantly wa&s;ting the excitability from the high degree or long conti|nuance of its &s;timulus. On the contrary, the powers that favour it, are tho&s;e that act gently, and with &s;ome exce&s;s: but never attain that high degree of activity, that inclines to indirect debility: They are powers that go on &s;oftly and plea&s;antly, that particularly keep up moderation in the per&s;piration, and thereby fill the ve&s;&s;els with blood; but, becau&s;e motion is avoided, they do not very much encrea&s;e the excitement of the ve&s;&s;els, and by means of the tran|quillity of motion <HI>kept up in the latter,</HI> allow a fluid, that would otherwi&s;e pa&s;s off by the external pores of the &s;ur|face, to turn a&s;ide into the cells of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at. Hence, though, as it has been &s;aid before, an abundance of blood is indeed a very great &s;timulus; yet, without other &s;timuli, and that mo&s;t powerful one, which mu&s;cular motion affords; it is evident, that a con&s;iderable degree of &s;timulus can be borne

without any con&s;iderable di&s;ea&s;e, and that it always pro|duces a predi&s;po&s;ition to &s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, but does not immediately bring them on. Hence, it is under&s;tood what place in the &s;cale of exce&s;&s;ive excitement, or of &s;the|nic diathe&s;is, obe&s;ity holds; what the degree of &s;timulant power is, and what the &s;timuli in particular, are that pro|duce it.</P>

<P>D. In this ca&s;e, therefore, as food is the principal hurt|ful power, le&s;s of it &s;hould be given, and more exerci&s;e en|gaged in. The&s;e are &s;ufficient for the cure<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">CCCCXCVIII.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>DII. The be&s;t method of lowering the diet, is to com|bine a quantity of vegetable matter with a moderate por|tion animal.

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Cau&s;e of Men&s;truation.</HEAD>
<P>DXXIII. The cau&s;e of men&s;truation is a conformati|on of the ve&s;&s;els that pour out the blood <HI>in this di&s;charge,</HI> taking place at a certain time of life, that is, about the age of puberty, and a &s;timulant energy in women, more power|ful than in the females <HI>of the other &s;pecies of animals.</HI></P>
<P>DXXIV. Of other animals there are very few, the fe|males of which undergo any &s;ort of men&s;truation out of the venereal orga&s;m.</P>
<P>DXXV. As all the ve&s;&s;els are gradually unfolded in the cour&s;e of the growth of the body, &s;o the &s;ame thing happens to the genital and uterine ve&s;&s;els, but la&s;t of all to the&s;e. The ends of the latter, terminating, on the &s;ides of the womb about the age of puberty, are at la&s;t &s;o very much expanded, as now to tran&s;mit fir&s;t the &s;erous part of the blood, and then, after an effort kept up for &s;ome time, pa&s;s to formal blood.</P>
<P>CXXVI. At this time of life a great change over the whole &s;y&s;tem takes place. Now the de&s;ire for coition, a &s;timulus, never experienced before, produces a commotion over the whole body; and, in preference to other parts, in the genitals of both &s;exes, in the female, over the whole region of the ovaria, womb, and vagina: By this &s;timu|lus, the uterus, its &s;eat, being nearly ince&s;&s;antly &s;olicited, is the more powerfully affected, the more there is of exci|tability, hitherto acted upon by no &s;uch &s;timulus, exi&s;ting in the &s;y&s;tem. Hence, among other organs, the mu&s;cu|lar fibres of the next ve&s;&s;els, as well as the nerves interwo|ven with them, undergo the highe&s;t degree of excitement: This excitement encrea&s;ing over the whole &s;y&s;tem, again en|crea&s;es that in the uterus: The mutual contact of the &s;exes,
<PB N="295" REF="022373_0309_0FB8653B17B19CE0">
whether in ki&s;&s;ing, in &s;haking hands, or otherwi&s;e, fires both &s;ets of genitals, and the uterus in a remarkable manner; but the actual embrace produces the highe&s;t degree of that effect. The remembrance of each embrace remains, renews the dear idea of the delightful &s;cene, and continues more or le&s;s to excite the uterus.</P>
<P>DXXVII. This new affection is further cheri&s;hed and nouri&s;hed by every &s;timulus that is u&s;ually applied to the &s;y&s;tem: Hence, in the ab&s;ence, in the pre&s;ence, of the beloved object, at all times generally, &s;carce with the ex|ception of <HI>that which pa&s;&s;es</HI> in dreaming, a &s;timulus &s;o &s;tea|dy, and the more powerful, that its novelty implies, that the excitability in this ca&s;e is entire, rou&s;es the fibres of the ve&s;&s;els, already &s;ufficiently unfolded, to violent con|tractions. The blood is carried into the region of the u|terus with the greate&s;t rapidity, a rapidity momentarily en|crea&s;ed, in proportion as the blood, by powerfully di&s;ten|ding the ve&s;&s;els, and agitating them by its impetuous flow, &s;timulates the fibres more and more, and thereby encrea|&s;es the activity by which it is driven on. This is the fir&s;t cau&s;e of men&s;truation: In that way, the two circum&s;tances, a &s;ufficient enlargement of the diameters of the ve&s;&s;els, and the &s;timulus acting more powerfully, from its novelty, upon the unwa&s;ted excitability<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">See DXXIII.</NOTE>, are &s;ufficient for the whole bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>DXXVIII. This &s;tate is not incon&s;i&s;tent with other &s;tates of the body, but bears an analogy to &s;ome well known ones: Accordingly, different ve&s;&s;els, from the <HI>mere</HI> differ|ence of their diameters, are &s;ub&s;ervient to different pur|po&s;es: The per&s;piratory ve&s;&s;els are de&s;tined to the tran&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of a vapour, the excretory ve&s;&s;els of the alimentary canal to that of a thing fluid, the renal ve&s;&s;els to that of a gro&s;&s;er one; &s;o as to take off our &s;urpri&s;e at finding ve&s;&s;els

<P>DXXIX. The rea&s;on that the females of other animals do not men&s;truate but in their orga&s;m, and not at other times, is, that it is only at certain times that they are ex|po&s;ed to that energy of &s;timulus which produces men&s;trua|tion.</P>
<P>DXXX. How much is owing to the &s;timulus ju&s;t now mentioned<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See DXXIII. DXXVI.</NOTE>, in the production of men&s;truation, is fur|ther evident from the following chain of facts: Which are, that, the le&s;s addicted to love women are, the le&s;s they men&s;truate; the more they give way to that pa&s;&s;ion, the freer do they experience this di&s;charge within certain boun|daries; that, before puberty, and after the time of life when men&s;truation cea&s;es (which are the two periods, at which the fitne&s;s for effective love has not yet commenced, or is now pa&s;&s;ed,) the men&s;trual di&s;charge is con&s;tantly wanting; that the privation of enjoyment, which, by <HI>its</HI> debilitating <HI>effect,</HI> produces chloro&s;is<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">or the green &s;ickne&s;s.</NOTE> and other &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;es, is remarkable for bringing on a menorrhoea, or a retention of men&s;truation; and, finally, that girls, who are of a forward growth, of great &s;trength, and large limbs, and con&s;equently &s;ooner ripe for love, are <HI>al&s;o</HI> more early in men&s;truation; while tho&s;e, who are weakly, puny, and of a &s;mall &s;ize, and, con&s;equently, later in attaining to the period of puberty, are proportionally late in attain|ing the fir&s;t men&s;trual di&s;charge. La&s;tly, if, like all the other functions, that of love is limited at the &s;ame time by its duration and degree; and if, as the commencement of the love embraces is more or le&s;s early, it is proportionally more early or late in coming to its final termination, and if the duration of men&s;truation does not u&s;ually exceed that period; that fact al&s;o, <HI>which it certainly is,</HI> added to
<PB N="297" REF="022373_0311_0FB86541B8503E98">
tho&s;e above, gives weight to our conclu&s;ion, and &s;hows, in a clearer point of view, how much men&s;truation de|pends upon the venereal emotion. It is to be a&s;&s;erted, therefore, again<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">DXXIII. DXXVI.</NOTE>, that, be&s;ides the conformation of the ve&s;&s;els, &s;uited to <HI>the function of</HI> men&s;truation, and the &s;timu|lus which has been mentioned(k), there is occa&s;ion for no other <HI>circum&s;tance to explain</HI> either commencement, e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, or continuation, of the men&s;trual di&s;charge.</P>
<P>DXXXI. The cau&s;e of full men&s;truation, and that of a moderate degree of it, happening within the boundaries of health, is the &s;ame; only differing in degree; the degree of the latter being &s;maller, and that of the former greater.</P>
<P>DXXXII. And, as the &s;timuli, mentioned above, ex|plain, why women men&s;truate more than the females of other animals; &s;o their immoderate operation upon wo|men &s;erves to &s;how, why <HI>their effect,</HI> the men&s;trual di&s;|charge, becomes greater than natural<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Women men&s;truate more than other females, becau&s;e they are &s;ub|jected to a higher degree of the &s;timulus, which is its cau&s;e; and &s;uch women as are expo&s;ed to more of the &s;ame &s;timulus than others, will al|&s;o experience more of the effect, preci&s;ely upon that &s;ame principle.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DXXXIII. The &s;timuli that produce abundant men|&s;truation, &s;hort of morbid &s;tate, are uncha&s;te ideas, and a high energy of pa&s;&s;ion. In this way, the influence of reading to ones' &s;elf, or to others, of conver&s;ation, of pictures, contrived to kindle up lu&s;tful appetite, and the uncovering of parts that mode&s;ty conceals, which all pro|duce a lively impre&s;&s;ion on the imagination of the thing &s;o much de&s;ired; can be indi&s;tinctly felt by none perhaps but eunuchs. The &s;ame is the effect of nouri&s;hing food, and generous drink, and high &s;ea&s;oning; and hence the pro|verb, without meat and drink love &s;tarves: Likewi&s;e, that degree of exerci&s;e, or <HI>even</HI> labour, that does not prove fa|tiguing, but that keeps within the boundary of &s;timulant
<PB N="298" REF="022373_0312_0FB865429DEFD180">
operation; as al&s;o an abundance of blood, both from that circum&s;tance and from rich diet; la&s;tly, frequent and ar|dent dalliance, or <HI>inconce&s;&s;a bujus imitatio;</HI> all the&s;e, en|crea&s;e the men&s;trual di&s;charge, in proportion to the high degree of their &s;timulus, but &s;till do not carry their effect to morbid exce&s;s.</P>
<P>DXXXIV. The &s;ame conclu&s;ion applies to the effect of the&s;e &s;timuli, which was formerly applied to an over-proportion of blood producing &s;thenic diathe&s;is: For the ultimate end of all the &s;timuli, that produce exce&s;&s;ive men&s;truation, is &s;uch, that, if exce&s;&s;ive men&s;truation and an encrea&s;e of love be the con&s;equence of the exce&s;s of the &s;timuli, one or other of the following mu&s;t be the effect: that is, it will either be &s;uch as remains within the lati|tude of health, or &s;uch, as fir&s;t produces &s;thenic diathe&s;is, and then, in a higher degree of it, runs rapidly into indi|rect debility.</P>
<P>DXXXV. That this is the fact, is proved by the hurt|ful powers that produce exce&s;&s;ive and morbid men&s;truation; and by remedies, that are &s;timulant and &s;uited to fill the ve&s;&s;els, removing the di&s;ea&s;e according to our late di&s;cove|ry; and al&s;o by the unfortunate effect of the debilitating evacuant plan of cure in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>DXXXVI. As it is &s;timulant operation that produces both proper men&s;truation and that which goes to a little exce&s;s; &s;o, when once men&s;truation is e&s;tabli&s;hed, the con|formation and &s;timulus, that have been mentioned, re|maining, are &s;ufficient to &s;upport it. The &s;ame opera|tion is renewed during every interval of men&s;truation: The &s;timulus acts and quickens the motion of the blood in eve|ry part, but chiefly in that where it is mo&s;t powerful and mo&s;t required, that is, in the region of the womb: The blood thrown into quick motion, and ru&s;hing with a more rapid flow, encrea&s;es its cau&s;e, the &s;timulus: And, as this mutual &s;timulus continues ince&s;&s;antly to affect the
<PB N="299" REF="022373_0313_0FB8654406CB22C0">
women through the whole interval, when they are allowed &s;cope of love; the uterine ve&s;&s;els are gradually unfolded, till at la&s;t, within three weeks, or a lunar month, they are opened to their ultimate extremities: And, when the fluid, fir&s;t &s;erous for a little, and afterwards &s;anguine, and afterwards &s;erous again for a little, has flowed one, two, or three days, in healthy per&s;ons, the ve&s;&s;els are at la&s;t &s;hut up.</P>
<P>DXXXVII. During the whole time of this proce&s;s, the more excitability there is, and con&s;equently at the begin|ning of each men&s;trual effort, the more violently the &s;ti|mulus acts, and produces proportionally more excitement: And it has, from this time, always le&s;s and le&s;s effect to the end, in proportion as the excitability is more wa&s;ted; though, till the excitability, in &s;o far as it has a relation to the &s;timulus, is altogether exhau&s;ted, the &s;timulus always adds &s;omething to the &s;um of excitement,<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">See XXXVI.</NOTE>, though con|&s;tantly le&s;s and le&s;s. The &s;ame is the explanation of the operation of food, of drink, and of all the exciting pow|ers.</P>
<P>DXXXVIII. As what has been &s;aid of the &s;timulus, productive of men&s;truation, is conformable to the effects of all the other &s;timuli; the &s;ame is its conformity to the whole &s;um of men&s;trual effect from the beginning to the end of the proce&s;s. Thus, in the beginning of that long period, the force of &s;timulus is far the greate&s;t, upon ac|count of its novelty, and the unwa&s;ted &s;tate of excitability that relates to it. At this period, above all others, love in per&s;ons in health is exqui&s;ite; and, in con&s;equence of the &s;timulus which excites it, men&s;truation, when once e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, is mo&s;t exactly performed; that is, it does not, either from deficiency or exce&s;s, deviate into morbid &s;tate.</P>
<P>DXXXIX. But after the beginning of this function, and when now the office of men&s;truation is e&s;tabli&s;hed;
<PB N="300" REF="022373_0314_0FB8654A3468A040">
becau&s;e in this, as well as every other function, the exci|tability is gradually dimini&s;hed in the progre&s;s of life, the &s;timulant power al&s;o has gradually le&s;s, and, at la&s;t, no effect: Con&s;equently, in the &s;ame gradual way, the power of love in women, and, in proportion, that of men&s;trua|tion, is dimini&s;hed, and at la&s;t altogether extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>DXL. While both the faculties, that of love as well as that of men&s;truation, in this way decrea&s;e from the begin|ning to the end; &s;o, men&s;truation is often interrupted, in pregnancy, in &s;uckling, in the diminution or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of men&s;truation. This interruption in the two former i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> natural, and &s;uitable to health; <HI>but</HI> in the diminution or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the men&s;trual evacuation, it becomes mor|bid.</P>
<P>DXLI. Since the &s;timulus with the conformation of the ve&s;&s;els is the cau&s;e of men&s;truation, and the latter depends upon the former; &s;o again the defect of the &s;timulus, and, therefore, of the conformation, produces both the retar|dation, diminution, and, at la&s;t, the complete &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the di&s;charge.</P>
<P>DXLII. Whether ever the defect of men&s;truation, like that of per&s;piration, or of any internal excretion, as that in the fauces and alimentary canal, is &s;ometimes to be im|puted to &s;thenic diathe&s;is, is uncertain, for this rea&s;on; that, while the diameters of the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els on the &s;kin and in the inte&s;tines are more nearly allied to &s;uch a contraction for a rea&s;on <HI>formerly</HI> a&s;&s;igned<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">LVII. LXII. CXII.

And the doubt i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> further encrea&s;ed by <HI>a certain fact; which is,</HI> that both in the retardation of the men&s;trua, and in all the degrees of their diminution to their total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, when local af|fection
<PB N="301" REF="022373_0315_0FB8654B89DF5BE8">
is out of the que&s;tion, there are evident proofs of a debilitating cau&s;e.</P>
<P>DXLIII. To a&s;certain that fact, which is of the great|e&s;t con&s;equence for this rea&s;on, that it directly intere&s;ts the method of cure, and, if not explained, would leave a gap in our principles; <HI>we have to ob&s;erve,</HI> that, as &s;ome men, in con&s;equence of the &s;timulus of exce&s;&s;ive love, in the ca&s;e of a mo&s;t beautiful woman being the &s;ubject of it, have, by means of &s;thenic diathe&s;is, been &s;o inflamed as to fall into a temporary fit of impotence, and been cured by bleed|ing; &s;o, be&s;ides that that is a rare fact<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">I remember one in&s;tance in Dr. Whyte, and I think I have only heard of another.</NOTE>, it is not very pro|bable, that the patulous uterine ve&s;&s;els can be &s;o contracted in their diameters, as to be incapable of tran&s;miting their fluid. Nay facts contradict it: The retardation or defici|ency of men&s;truation receive a temporary alleviation from the debilitating plan of cure; but the di&s;charge is not u&s;u|ally al&s;o brought back, on the contrary it is more kept off: But allowing an over-proportion of blood and an exce&s;s of &s;timulus to be the cau&s;e of the fir&s;t deficiency of men&s;tru|ation, after it has been removed by bleeding and the re&s;t of the debilitating plan of cure, can it again be the cau&s;e of a di&s;ea&s;e, which re&s;i&s;ts a degree of evacuant and debili|tating plan of cure, that would cure ten peripneumonies? And &s;ince any &s;timulus, as well as <HI>that of</HI> an over-propor|tion of blood, may, from its exce&s;&s;ive force, go into indi|rect debility; why may not the &s;ame thing happen in a di&s;appointment in love, and fir&s;t deficiency of men&s;truati|on; and, in both ca&s;es, atony, u&s;hering in manife&s;t debili|ty, and not exce&s;s of tone, be the cau&s;e? As peripneumo|ny, where the over-proportion of blood and &s;thenic diathe|&s;is is by far the greate&s;t <HI>that ever happens,</HI> in con&s;equence of indirect debility pa&s;&s;es into hydrothorax; why may not a &s;imilar cau&s;e in this ca&s;e produce a &s;imilar effect?</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="022373_0316_0FB8654D08AA8950">
DXLIV. The cau&s;e, then, of deficient men&s;truation, whether partial or complete, is a languid excitement over the whole body, e&s;pecially in the uterus, from a deficien|cy of the &s;timulus of love<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">DXXIII. DXXVI. DXXIX.</NOTE>, and of all tho&s;e &s;timuli that &s;upport it<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">DXXVI. DXXVII. DXXXII. DXXXVII.</NOTE>, and from a penury, or under-proportion of blood.</P>

<P>DXLVI. The remedies for the cure of retarded men|&s;truation are, rich food, generous drink, ge&s;tation, exerci&s;e accommodated to the &s;trength, pediluvium and &s;emicupi|um, or the warm bath of the under-extremities, and grati|fication in love<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">DXXVI.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Of Scurvy.</HEAD>
<P>DLXXVII. Scurvy is an evident a&s;thenia: The prin|cipal &s;ymptoms of which are, want of appetite, loathing

of food, laxity of the living &s;olids con&s;idered as &s;imple &s;o|lids; an oozing of blood, both from other parts, and par|ticularly from the gums; aver&s;ion to labour; low &s;pirits, and a languor in all the functions.</P>
<P>DLXXVIII. The hurtful powers producing this di&s;|ea&s;e, are the common a&s;thenic ones, appearing in the fol|lowing form: It is cold in this ca&s;e, but conjoined with moi&s;ture in the northern &s;eas, and, as <HI>we may well &s;uppo&s;e,</HI> in the parts of the &s;outhern ocean of the &s;ame temperature, that generally produces the peculiar form of the di&s;ea&s;e. But with it all the other debilitating powers contribute their &s;hare: Such are, grief for the lo&s;s of liberty, relations, kindred, and friends; a horrid di&s;like to their pre&s;ent &s;tate of life; a longing de&s;ire for that which they have parted with; the awe which the &s;everity of di&s;cipline keeps them in; <HI>the effect of</HI> a calm, where there is nothing to do, pro|ducing direct debility on them; a &s;torm, where they have to labour above their powers, <HI>as certain a cau&s;e of</HI> indirect debility; their not having been allowed, till o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, fre&s;h meat, which is the only nouri&s;hing and envigorating<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">See CXXIV.</NOTE> <HI>form of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> their being kept upon &s;alted and &s;poiled meat, and not even corrected by recent vegetable aliment, &s;uch as that is<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See CXXVIII.</NOTE>; watery or &s;mall drink; the terror which the expectation of a battle at &s;ea in&s;pires.</P>
<P>DLXXIX. All tho&s;e particulars prove, that &s;curvy is &s;o far from being the effect of one or two hurtful powers, and from re&s;ting upon &s;o narrow <HI>a ba&s;is of</HI> the cau&s;e <HI>pro|ducing it,</HI> as has hitherto been imagined; that it is rooted in a multiplicity of debilitating powers, and is a real a&s;t|henia, <HI>or univer&s;al di&s;ea&s;e of debility.</HI></P>
<P>DLXXX. And this fact is confirmed by both the true and fal&s;e method <HI>employed</HI> for its cure: For, though nearly all the common powers concur in the production of &s;curvy; if, however, it be con&s;idered, how ea&s;ily, upon the remo|val of the hurtful powers, and the patient getting a &s;hore,

The pretence of its cure being effected by greens, roots, &s;our<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rout, and &s;imilar things, &s;o much boa&s;ted of lately, which, without the remedies ju&s;t now enumerated, could not fail, by their debilitating ope|ration, to aggravate the di&s;ea&s;e, is derived from a noted blunder among phy&s;icians, by which they are led to over|look the mo&s;t certain, &s;imple, and evident facts, and take up in place of them, the greate&s;t fal&s;ehoods, or &s;uch facts as have a very narrow foundation in truth.</P>

<P>CLXXXIII. As all &s;timulants contribute to the re&s;to|ration of the healthy &s;tate; &s;o the mo&s;t powerful of them in this ca&s;e is nouri&s;hing food, friction, ge&s;tation, wine, taken in moderation, exerci&s;e, rather frequent than violent, and being as much as po&s;&s;ible in the open air. If it is an acknowledged fact, that rheumatalgia is one of the reproach|es of phy&s;icians, it is more &s;o than has been hitherto un|der&s;tood; it being an a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;e, while they at all times made u&s;e of the &s;ame kind of cure, as if it had been

<HEAD>Of the A&s;thenic Cough.</HEAD>
<P>DLXXXVIII. The a&s;thenic cough is an a&s;thenia, which with the con&s;tant &s;ymptoms of the latter, depends upon a frequent expectoration, that the cough excites; af|fecting every age which has been under the influence of ei|ther direct, or indirect debility, and therefore old age, which is unavoidably the prey of indirect debility.</P>
<P>DLXXXXIX. As con&s;i&s;ting in indirect debility, it is the effect of an exce&s;&s;ive violence of all &s;timuli that have been applied either for a &s;hort time, or for a great part of life, their operation coming to the &s;ame amount, that of the former from its degree, and that of the latter from its long continuance<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">See above XXIX. XXX. and CCCCI.</NOTE>. In &s;o far as its cau&s;e is direct deblity, a deficiency of all the &s;timuli, leaving the excitability to be accumulated, allows this form of a&s;thenia to happen from the &s;pontaneous tendency of nature, of which life is only a forced &s;tate<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">So great is nature's tendency to that particular encrea&s;e of exerti|on; which forms the matter of expectoration in this di&s;ea&s;e, that every ca&s;e of death from di&s;ea&s;e is an in&s;tance of it. Hence the dead rattle in the throat is univer&s;ally the expiring &s;ymptom. See LXXII, and CCCXXVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DXC. The cough, which depends upon indirect debi|lity, is cured by reducing the &s;timulus which occa&s;ioned it, gradually and cautiou&s;ly to the proper and natural degree
<PB N="316" REF="022373_0330_0FB8656DCD5D4B90">
And when it originates from indirect debility, the encrea&s;e of the &s;timulus, <HI>the want of which occa&s;ioned the di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> till the degree of excitement, which con&s;titutes health is repla|ced, effects the cure.</P>
<P>DXCI. Such is the nature of direct and indirect debi|lity; that if the remedies of the former be pu&s;hed beyond the boundary, the cough appears again; and the &s;ame is the event of the &s;ame exce&s;s in the u&s;e of the remedies of the latter<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">See par. XXXIII. XXXIV. and XLIII. XXX. CXXXIV. and e&s;pecially CCXXXIII. to CCXXXVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DXCII. Frequent and violent cough with copious ex|pectoration has been always held for a &s;ure mark of a vi|tiation or faulty &s;tate in the lungs. That faulty &s;tate was e&s;teemed to be of a &s;thenic nature, and to give a&s;&s;urance of the pre&s;ence &s;ometimes of phthi&s;ipneumony, or con&s;ump|tion from an ulcer in the lungs, &s;ometimes ba&s;tard peri|pneumony, &s;ometimes of a burning inflammation in the alimentary canal. In the former ca&s;e an ulcer, or, in their way of &s;peaking, and what amounts to the &s;ame thing, tu|bercles were believed the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; in the &s;e|cond ca&s;e inflammation either in the interco&s;tal mu&s;cles, or a different one from that, which in true peripneumony was, in their opinion, its primary cau&s;e, was con&s;idered as the cau&s;e; and in the la&s;t ca&s;e, no one of them would have he&s;itated a moment to have a&s;cribed the &s;tate of the bowels, to the only inflammation they were acquainted with, that which requires bleeding and evacuation for its cure. And no other enquiry was made, but whether the matter that was &s;pit up, was mucus or pus. To a&s;certain that premiums were propo&s;ed.</P>

<P>DCIX. What had hitherto deceived phy&s;icians, <HI>and pa&s;&s;ed</HI> for a cau&s;e of the gout, was the appearance of vigour and an over proportion of blood, in mo&s;t podagrics, from the bulk of &s;imple &s;olids in con&s;equence of their way of life, and often from <HI>great</HI> &s;trength. But, good men! they never recollected, that vigour and a great quantity of blood was not a property inherent in animals, but that it depen|ded upon foreign circum&s;tances every day and every hour<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">X.

there be the lea&s;t probability, that the former will, not|with&s;tanding <HI>his pre&s;ent</HI> ab&s;olute want, continue plethoric and vigorous; and that the latter, from being now cram|med with unu&s;ual plenty, will continue empty, as he had been before? Is the fundamental propo&s;ition of this doctrine, in which it has been demon&s;trated, that we are nothing of our&s;elves, and that we are altogether governed by foreign powers, to be forgot? Is a per&s;on liable to the gout, who has for twenty years undergone an exce&s;s of &s;ti|mulant operation, about the fortieth year of his age, or e|ven afterwards, to be reckoned fuller of blood and more vi|gorous, either than another per&s;on who has lived lower, or then him&s;elf twenty years before? Where, pray, was the nece&s;&s;ity of comparing gouty per&s;ons with others free from <HI>all bias to</HI> that di&s;ea&s;e, and not comparing them with them&s;elves<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Such is the effect of the powers operating upon us, that a certain degree of that operation produces an effect that would not ari&s;e under another. If the accu&s;tomary operation has been moderate, habit will render the excitement ari&s;ing from it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ufficient for the demands of the &s;y&s;tem: Hence, day-labourers are &s;upported upon le&s;s &s;ti|mulus than gentlemen. Again, which is a circum&s;tance liable to happen to the latter, if the accu&s;tomary operation has been exce&s;&s;ive, there will be a nece&s;&s;ity for a continuation of &s;ome degree of the exce&s;s. A podagric may be &s;tronger than a labourer, and yet, fall into the gout. For, though compared with the other per&s;on, he is &s;trong; compared with him&s;elf at another time, he is weak: And the rea&s;on is, that though he is &s;till bet|ter &s;upported than the labourer, he is wor&s;e &s;upported, than the u&s;ual &s;tate of his &s;y&s;tem requires. Further, the labourer, though he falls not into the gout, may, by carrying his moderation too far, fall into indige&s;|tion, or &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e, in every e&s;&s;ential re&s;pect the &s;ame as the gout. A double inference ari&s;es here: Which is, that, though both exce&s;s and deficiency can be borne to a certain degree, &s;o as to require a continu|ance of them, or a gradual correction, yet they &s;hould both be avoided as entailing that &s;ort of nece&s;&s;ity for their continuance while their effect makes no &s;ort of compen&s;ation, being, at be&s;t, not the be&s;t &s;tate, that of perfect health, but a &s;tate of predi&s;po&s;ition to di&s;ea&s;e; the one to &s;thenic and at la&s;t indirect debility; the other to a&s;thenic, as depending on di|rect debility. The perfect rule for en&s;uring the healthy &s;tate, is to keep within the extremes of exce&s;s and defect, and thereby produce the due degree of excitement; and to apply all the exciting powers equally, each in its due proportion. The due degree may be &s;ecured by one or a few, but the equality of it over the &s;y&s;tem can only be &s;ecured by their equal application. This propo&s;ition goes to the bottom of two exten&s;ive doctrines, that of life, and that of morals; the la&s;t of which has as yet not attained to any thing like a fundamental principle. I intend to pro|&s;ecute the idea upon &s;ome future occa&s;ion. I know a book filled with valuable ethic facts, but have not yet had time to con&s;ider, whether they all point to a general one, in which they all agree, and which reflects proof and confirmation upon them; without which it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">all &s;hort of &s;cientific exactne&s;s.</NOTE>?</P>

And, therefore, if at any time a|ny other form of a&s;thenia, whether from wrong treatment, or other hurtful powers, in its progre&s;s terminates in this effu&s;ion; every &s;uch ca&s;e &s;hould be held as a proper drop|&s;y<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">See LXXXI.</NOTE>; and it &s;hould be ever pre&s;ent to our recollection, that there are only two general di&s;ea&s;es, and that the di&s;|tinctions hitherto received, are devoid of all &s;olid founda|tion. Accordingly, both from other improprieties, and particularly from bleeding, epilep&s;y, pal&s;y, the gout, ter|minate in real drop&s;y. Nay, the &s;ame is the termination of peripneumony it&s;elf, when it is either converted into in|direct debility, from the debilitating plan of cure having been pu&s;hed to exce&s;s, or into direct debility, from having been left to it&s;elf, and the body not &s;ufficiently debilitated. The affections, confined to parts, which are con&s;idered as the remote cau&s;es of drop&s;y, will be treated among the lo|cal di&s;ea&s;es, to which they belong.</P>

<P>DCXXXI. Be&s;ides the general indication of cure for a&s;thenia, that <HI>&s;uited to this ca&s;e</HI> mu&s;t be particularly directed to the whole va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, and e&s;pecially about their ter|minations, and the commencements of the ab&s;orbent veins. The remedies are al&s;o the u&s;ual ones; that is diet, as nouri&s;hing and &s;timulant as po&s;&s;ible; fir&s;t in a fluid form, when the &s;olid cannot be admitted upon account of the debility of the &s;tomach; then, al&s;o in a &s;olid; and toge|ther with both, &s;trong drink, &s;uch as the be&s;t wine that can be got, fermented &s;pirit, &s;ometimes pure, &s;ometimes diluted.

<P>DCXLIV. The heads of the patients are large and not well formed, their necks &s;hort and thick: The di&s;|ea&s;e ari&s;e from both direct and indirect debility, but chiefly from the latter. Of the indirect debilitating powers, the mo&s;t powerful is the luxury of food, drink, and &s;loth, which, after its cour&s;e of &s;timulating and filling the ve&s;&s;els is run, is truly debilitating and productive of a penury of fluids: And, as each &s;ort of debility is encrea&s;ed by the other, and con&s;equently the indirect by the direct, &s;o that is remarkably the ca&s;e in this di&s;ea&s;e.

To pre|vent, therefore, the fits, in every re&s;pect alarming and full of danger, we ought to recollect, how far indirect debility has a &s;hare in producing this di&s;ea&s;e, and how far the di|rect concurs with it; and al&s;o con&s;ider the operation of a greatly advanced age. All exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus, therefore, mu&s;t be avoided in &s;uch a manner, that the body may be invigorated and direct debility guarded again&s;t, the &s;timu|lant plan of cure &s;hould be &s;et on foot with moderation and accuracy; and, in the place of the forms of &s;timuli, that have, either from long or exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e, lo&s;t their &s;timulant operation, according to the rule of nature, others, which the excitability, yet not worn out with re&s;pect to them, can receive, &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted, that is, the kinds of food, of drink, and of diffu&s;ible &s;timuli, &s;hould be changed all round, and upon the failure of each lately u&s;ed one, to return to tho&s;e that have been long ago laid a&s;ide<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">CCCI.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>DCLVI. Parox&s;yms, con&s;i&s;ting of a cold, hot, and &s;weat|ing fit, are a &s;ort of phoenomena that occur in every in|termittent; and, in a certain proportion, in every remit|tent fever.

It is &s;omewhat &s;trange, that a man born in that country, if he would patch up a &s;y&s;tem of fevers, &s;hould have over|looked a form of them, that occurred to his eye-&s;ight every day, and bor|rowed his hypothetical cour&s;e from a mar&s;h mia&s;ma, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the produce of great heat and moi&s;ture, though he had only heard or read of the intermittents of warm countries.</NOTE>; at other times after that of heat only<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">In the warm countries agues often occur, when it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern heat to be an hurtful power; but when moi&s;ture is much le&s;s prevalent, for that very rea&s;on that the heat is prevalent, than at other &s;ea&s;ons when the di&s;ea&s;e does not occur.</NOTE>, when the common a&s;thenic hurtful powers accompany either: And they return with a

The &s;timulus of cor|poreal motion, which is a great and rough indirectly debilitating power, is often too long continued, after a typhus fever has begun its in&s;idious attack upon the habit; and hence the after-part of the di&s;ea&s;e becomes more &s;evere and dangerous. It is al&s;o to the &s;ame cau&s;e that we owe the propriety of excluding light and &s;ound, when they prove cau&s;es of irri|tation, their &s;timulus, though &s;light, being too &s;trong for their accu|mulated excitability. The guarding again&s;t gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion and emotion, as well as mental exertion, is all upon the &s;ame principle. When a per|&s;on falls into a fever from exce&s;&s;ive labour and low diet at the &s;ame time, that is an in&s;tance of a mixture of debility from the beginning. Again, when any di&s;ea&s;e, chiefly of indirect debility, is treated by bleeding, o|ther evacuations and &s;tarving, that is an in&s;tance of a &s;uperinducement of direct upon indirect debility. A judicious practitioner, and who pre|&s;cribes according to the rules that ari&s;e from a near acquaintance with the operations of the inanimate part of matter upon living &s;y&s;tems, will find plenty of &s;cope for the exerci&s;e of his judgement in the&s;e and many other niceties: And he will find, that the Brunonian doctrine, as it is now nick|named by tho&s;e who know it not, is not a doctrine to be practi&s;ed without knowledge, without judgement, and without &s;en&s;e; but that it requires e|very part of knowledge requi&s;ite to throw light upon &s;o exten&s;ive a &s;ubject, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat of the &s;cience of life over all nature, and all the judgement and good &s;en&s;e of the &s;ounde&s;t under&s;tanding to carry it into application upon many occa&s;ions of nicety and difficulty. The tra&s;h that has hitherto too often pa&s;&s;ed for knowledge, is to be acknowledged not only u&s;ele&s;s, but hurtful. But the true knowledge of nature mu&s;t be always elegant, al|ways &s;atisfactory, always u&s;eful. It is to be hoped the day is not far di&s;tant, when this doctrine will change its pre&s;ent appellation, into that of the doctrine of Nature, over the living part of her productions; com|prehending not only the morbid but healthy phoenomena, and the di&s;|tinctions between the living and the dead &s;tate.</NOTE>.</P>

The dram drinkers know the remedy, but they know not its bounds. They have recour&s;e to a gla&s;s of &s;trong &s;pirit, and they would be right if they &s;topt at one, two, or a very few, according to the quan|tity, that their former habit may render nece&s;&s;ary, and take no more than what gave them an appetite for &s;olid nouri&s;hing animal food; which, whatever the quantity that is required to produce it be, is the be&s;t general rule: But they go on, and every day till that of their death, which &s;oon arrives, renew the di&s;ea&s;e.

By the ble&s;&s;ed u&s;e of tho&s;e remedies, the excitement of the &s;tomach is re&s;tored, &s;o that with a return of appetite, food can be taken in, and dige&s;ted, in &s;o far as the powers of that organ go; which are confined chiefly to the fir&s;t part of dige&s;tion, or what is called the fir&s;t concoction. Next the ex|citement is re&s;tored in the other dige&s;tive organs, in the duodenum, in the biliary ve&s;&s;els, the pancreatic duct, in the lacteal ve&s;&s;els, through their whole cour&s;e from the inte&s;tines to their common receptacle, as all the ve&s;&s;els that return lymph from every part of the body, in the veins be|twixt the thoracic duct and the heart, in all the cavities of the latter, in all the red arteries, in the colourle&s;s terminations of all the&s;e, whether exhalant or glandular, and whether only &s;imple &s;eparating, or al&s;o chan|ging, the property of the fluid they &s;ecrate, in all the internal cavities of the body, in the commencing extremities of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, and in their progre&s;s through their lymphatic trunks to the receptacle in com|mon to them with the lacteals, which are a part of their number, in the thoracic duct again; as al&s;o from that to the heart, and from the heart to the extremities of the arteries: La&s;tly, the influence of excite|ment is extended to the&s;e terminations of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, whether exhalant or glandular&punc; which perform the &s;everal functions of excremen|titious &s;ecretion and excretion, by which every portion of fluids, now be|come u&s;ele&s;s, or, if they were retained, hurtful to the &s;y&s;tem, are thrown out by their &s;everal emunctories. When, by the u&s;e of the diffu&s;ible &s;ti|muli, the &s;tomach, and all the organs can perform their re&s;pective func|tions, the natural &s;timuli begin to be re&s;tored; the &s;tomach, the inte&s;|tines, the lacteals and blood ve&s;&s;els, and all the other ve&s;&s;els, are gradu|ally filled with their re&s;pective fluids; the mu&s;cles on the &s;urface, and the mu&s;cular fibres recover their tone and den&s;ity; the brain recovers its vigour; heat and air can be now re&s;tored to the &s;urface; exerci&s;e can now add its u&s;eful &s;timulus; and all the functions return to their u&s;ual capability of being acted upon by the u&s;ual and ordinary exciting powers.</NOTE>, ten or twelve drops of laudanum given every quar|ter

<P>DCXCVI. The &s;econd part, likewi&s;e made up of or|ganic affections, occurs in parts <HI>of the &s;y&s;tem,</HI> whether inter|nal, or external, that are very &s;en&s;ible, endued with a great deal of excitability<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The excitability is here not talked of in its comparative &s;tates of abundance or deficiency, but in the degree in which any part po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it in preference to other parts.

<HEAD>The fir&s;t Part of Organic Local Di&s;ea&s;es, where no Effect, but in the hurt Part, ari&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>DCC. WITH regard to the fir&s;t part of local, organic di&s;ea&s;es; the hurting powers, that produce them, are &s;uch as produce a &s;olution of the continuity of a part, by wound|ing, eroding, or poi&s;oning; or that derange a part by con|tu&s;ion, compre&s;&s;ion, or &s;praining.</P>
<P>DCCI. The hurting powers, producing &s;olution of continuity, are all cutting, pricking, or mi&s;&s;ive, weapons: Acrid bodies and poi&s;ons produce &s;olution of continuity in another manner.</P>
<P>DCCII. When any of the&s;e hurting powers &s;lightly divide the &s;urface, and &s;carcely, or not at all, get to the bottom of the &s;kin; for the cure of &s;o trifling an affection, there is occa&s;ion for nothing but &s;hutting out the air, and cold, and exce&s;&s;ive heat, and avoiding every irrating &s;ub|&s;tance. For the only u&s;e of the cuticle is, by means of its in&s;en&s;ibility,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See DCXCVI. and the note.</NOTE>, (it being a &s;imple<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">not a living,</NOTE> &s;olid, and devoid of all excitability), to keep off the air, and all exce&s;s of tem|perature, and every rough or rude matter, which are all inimical to living &s;olids<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">So hurtful is the air and temperature to all parts below the cuticle, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">thing is a more certain cau&s;e of gangrene than their expo&s;ure, e|ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for a very &s;hort &s;pace of time: Nor is there any other way of acount|ing for the fatal effect of &s;light, &s;uperficial, but exten&s;ive burning.

<HEAD>Of the Inflammation in the Stomach.</HEAD>
<P>DCCVIII. The principal &s;ymptoms in ga&s;tritis are, pain in the region of the &s;tomach, a burning heat, deep &s;eated, encrea&s;ed by every thing that is either ate or drank, or in any &s;hape taken into the &s;tomach; hiccup, an incli|nation to vomiting, and the &s;udden throwing up what is taken in; and the pul&s;e &s;oon getting into a &s;tate of debi|lity, quickne&s;s, &s;wiftne&s;s, and hardi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>DCCIX. The exciting hurtful powers, and which pro|duce the &s;olution of continuity <HI>in this ca&s;e,</HI> are &s;uch as act by cutting, pricking or ero&s;ion. Such are the &s;mall bones of fi&s;hes, ground gla&s;s, or Cayan pepper and &s;uch like things.</P>
<P>DCCX.

In it the pul&s;e is &s;ofter, fuller, and a little &s;lower, than in a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;e when that precedes it; but a great deal &s;lower, than in a&s;thenic di&s;|ea&s;e, if it happen to &s;upervene upon it, and it is accom|panied with an undulatory, and, as it were, a pul&s;atory, motion of the labouring part; the&s;e &s;ymptoms are com|monly preceded by a &s;hivering: If the affection is internal, the patient &s;hould be kept quiet, and free from motion, and be &s;timulated; if it be external, the affected part &s;hould, over and above, be fomented, dre&s;&s;ed, and covered, and the pus, when ripe, let out.</P>

<P>DCCL. Gangrene is an imperfect inflammation of a part, not terminating in &s;uppuration, di&s;coloured, &s;carce painful, con&s;i&s;ting of pu&s;tules of a bad matter, and at la&s;t inducing the death of the part.</P>
<P>DCCLI.

<P>DCCLII. The method of cure, when the gangrene is &s;eated in the alimentary canal, is to pour in &s;pirit and lau|danum; when the &s;hut vi&s;cera are affected, to place &s;ome hope in the &s;ame and other &s;timuli, but <HI>much</HI> le&s;s. And, as the &s;ame remedies al&s;o &s;uit gangrene, when it is exter|nal, con&s;equently liquid opium &s;hould be rubbed in upon the dying part, &s;pirit &s;hould be poured upon it, the parts already dead &s;hould be cut out, the edge of the living part all round &s;hould be &s;timulated, and an inflammation made in it.</P>
