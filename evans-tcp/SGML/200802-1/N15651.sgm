<P><HI>MOST of the facts, together with the principles contained in the following Oration, were committed to paper above &s;even years ago.&mdash;If, they have the &s;ame operation upon the mind of the reader, that they had upon the mind of the author, they will at fir&s;t be doubted&mdash;af|terwards believed, and finally they will be propagated. He is &s;o far from propo&s;ing phy&s;ical influence, as a &s;ub&s;titute for religious, moral, or rational in&s;truction, that he offers it only as a reinforcement to the obligations of rea&s;on and religion; or rather, as a neglected part of chri&s;ti|anity. He is &s;en&s;ible that in this new, and difficult en|quiry, he has only performed the drudgery of a pioneer: Tho&s;e who come after him upon this &s;ubject, will find a way opened, for exten&s;ive and important ob&s;ervations, and will probably enjoy with more certainty, than the author, the fruits of their labors.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was for the laudable purpo&s;e of exciting a &s;pirit of emulation and enquiry, among the members of our body, that the founders of our Society, in&s;tituted an annual oration. The ta&s;k of pre|paring, and delivering this exerci&s;e, hath devolved, once more, upon me. I have &s;ubmitted to it,&mdash;not becau&s;e I thought my&s;elf capable of fulfilling your intentions, but becau&s;e I wi&s;hed, by a te&s;timony of my obedience to your reque&s;ts, to atone for my long ab&s;ence from the temple of &s;cience.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject upon which I am to have the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you this evening, is <Q>An enquiry into the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the moral faculty.</Q></P>
<P>BY the moral faculty I mean a power in the human mind of di&s;tingui&s;hing and chu&s;ing good and evil; or, in other words, virtue and vice. It is a native principle, and though it is capable of improvement by experience and reflection, it is not derived from either of them.&mdash;St. Paul, and Cicero, give us the mo&s;t perfect account of it that is to be found in modern or ancient authors. <Q>For when the Gentiles, (&s;ays St. Paul) which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, <HI>the&s;e,</HI> having not the law, are a <HI>law</HI> unto them&s;elves; which &s;hew the works of
<PB N="2" REF="019972_0006_0FAD4911B53C24B0">
the law written in their hearts, their con&s;ciences al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and their thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing, or el&s;e excu&s;ing one another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. II. 14. 15.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE words of Cicero are as follow&mdash;<Q>E&s;t igitur haec, judices, non &s;cripta, &s;ed nata lex, quam non didicimus, accepimus, legi|mus, verum ex natura ip&s;a arripuimus, hau&s;imus, expre&s;&s;imus, ad quam non docti, &s;ed facti, non in&s;tituti, &s;ed imbuti &s;umus.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Oratio pro Milone.</NOTE> This faculty is often confounded with con&s;cience, which is a di&s;tinct and independent power of the mind. This is evident from the pa&s;&s;age quoted from the writings of St. Paul, in which con|&s;cience is &s;aid to be the witne&s;s that accu&s;es, or excu&s;es us, of a breach of the law written in our hearts. The moral faculty is what the &s;choolmen call the "regula regulans,"&mdash;the con&s;cience is their "regula regulata." Or, to &s;peak in more modern terms, the moral faculty performs the office of a law-giver, while the bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;cience is to perform the duty of a judge. The moral faculty is to the con&s;cience, what ta&s;te is to the judgment, and &s;en|&s;ation to perception. It is quick in its operations, and like the &s;en&s;itive plant, acts without reflection, while con&s;cience follows with deliberate &s;teps, and mea&s;ures all her actions, by the unerring &s;quare of right and wrong. The moral faculty exerci&s;es it&s;elf upon the actions of others. It approves even in books, of the virtues of a Trajan, and di&s;approves of the vices of a Marius, while con&s;cience confines its operations, only to its own actions. The&s;e two powers of the mind are generally in an exact ratio to each other, but they &s;ometimes exi&s;t in different degrees in the &s;ame per&s;on. Hence we
<PB N="3" REF="019972_0007_0FAD49120BCE7DD0">
often find con&s;cience in its full vigor, with a dimini&s;hed tone, or total ab&s;ence of the moral faculty.</P>
<P>IT has long been a que&s;tion among metaphy&s;icians, whether the con&s;cience be &s;eated in the will or in the under&s;tanding. The con|trover&s;y can only be &s;ettled by admitting the will to be the &s;eat of the moral faculty, and the under&s;tanding to be the &s;eat of the con|&s;cience. The my&s;terious nature of the union of tho&s;e two moral principles with the will and under&s;tanding, is a &s;ubject foreign to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre&s;ent enquiry.&mdash;</P>
<P>AS I con&s;ider virtue and vice to con&s;i&s;t in <HI>action,</HI> and not in opinion, and as this action has its &s;eat in the <HI>will,</HI> and not in the con&s;cience, I &s;hall confine my enquiries chiefly to the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon that moral power of the mind, which is con|nected with volition, although many of the&s;e cau&s;es act likewi&s;e upon the con&s;cience, as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter.&mdash;The &s;tate of the moral faculty is vi&s;ible in actions, which affect the well-being of &s;ociety. The &s;tate of the con&s;cience is invi&s;ible, and therefore removed beyond our inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>THE moral faculty has received different names from different authors. It is the "moral &s;en&s;e" of Dr. Hutchi&s;on&mdash;the "&s;ympathy" of Dr. Adam Smith&mdash;the "moral in&s;tinct" of Rou&s;&s;eau&mdash;and "the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world" of St. John. I have adopted the term of moral faculty from Dr. Beattie, becau&s;e I conceive they convey with the mo&s;t per&s;picuity, the idea of a power in the mind, of chu&s;ing good and evil.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="019972_0008_0FAD4912D7929390">
OUR books of medicine contain many records of the effects of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the memory&mdash;the imagination&mdash;and the judge|ment. In &s;ome in&s;tances we behold their operation only on one,&mdash;in others on two,&mdash;and in many ca&s;es upon the whole of the&s;e faculties. Their derangement has received different names, ac|cording to the number or nature of the faculties that are affected. The lo&s;s of memory has been called "amne&s;ia"&mdash;fal&s;e judgment upon one &s;ubject has been called "melancholia"&mdash;fal&s;e judgment upon all &s;ubjects has been called "mania"&mdash;and a defect of all the three intellectual faculties that have been mentioned, has received the name of "amentia." Per&s;ons who labour under the derange|ment, or want of the&s;e powers of the mind, are con&s;idered, very properly, as &s;ubjects of medicine; and there are many ca&s;es upon record that prove, that their di&s;ea&s;es have yielded to the healing art.</P>
<P>IN order to illu&s;trate the effects of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the moral faculty, it will be nece&s;&s;ary <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to &s;hew their effects upon the me|mory&mdash;the imagination&mdash;and the judgment; and at the &s;ame time to point out the analogy between their operation upon the intellectual powers of the mind, and the moral faculty.</P>
<P N="1">1. Do we ob&s;erve a connection between the intellectual powers, and the degrees of con&s;i&s;tency and firmne&s;s of the brain in infancy and childhood?&mdash;The &s;ame connection has been ob&s;erved between the &s;trength as well as the progre&s;s of the moral faculty in children.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do we ob&s;erve a certain &s;ize of the brain, and a peculiar ca&s;t of features, &s;uch as the prominent eye, and the aquiline no&s;e, to be connected with extraordinary portions of genius?&mdash;We ob&s;erve a
<PB N="5" REF="019972_0009_0FAD4913846B7840">
&s;imilar connection between the figure and temperament of the body, and certain moral faculties.&mdash;Hence we often a&s;cribe good temper and benevolence to corpulency, and ira&s;cibility to &s;anguineous habits. Cae&s;ar thought him&s;elf &s;afe in the friend&s;hip of the "&s;leek-headed" Anthony and Dolabella, but was afraid to tru&s;t to the profe&s;&s;ions of the &s;lender Ca&s;&s;ius.</P>
<P N="3">3. Do we ob&s;erve certain degrees of the intellectual faculties to be hereditary in certain families? The &s;ame ob&s;ervation has been frequently extended to moral qualities&mdash;Hence we often find certain virtues and vices as peculiar to families, through all their degrees of con&s;anguinity, and duration, as a peculiarity of voice&mdash;complexion&mdash;or &s;hape.</P>
<P N="4">4. Do we ob&s;erve in&s;tances of a total want of memory&mdash;imagination&mdash;and judgment, either from an original defect in the &s;tamina of the brain, or from the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es?&mdash;The &s;ame unnatural defect is &s;ometimes ob&s;erved, and probably from the &s;ame cau&s;es, of a moral faculty. The celebrated Servin, who&s;e character is drawn by the Duke of Sully in his memoirs, appears to be an in&s;tance of the total ab&s;ence of the moral faculty, while the cha&s;m, produced thereby in his mind, &s;eems to have been filled up by a more than common exten&s;ion of every other power of his mind. I &s;hall beg leave to repeat the hi&s;tory of this prodigy of vice and knowledge.&mdash;<Q>Let the reader repre&s;ent to him&s;elf a man of a genius &s;o lively, and of an under&s;tanding &s;o exten&s;ive, as rendered him &s;carce ignorant of any thing that could be known&mdash;of &s;o va&s;t and ready a comprehen&s;ion, that he immediately made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of whatever he attempted,&mdash;
<PB N="6" REF="019972_0010_0FAD491448AACFA0">
and of &s;o prodigious a memory, that he never forgot what he once learned. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all parts of philo&s;ophy, and the mathematics, particularly fortification and drawing. Even in theology he was &s;o well &s;killed, that he was an excellent preacher, whenever he had a mind to exert that talent, and an able di&s;putant, for and again&s;t the reformed religion indifferently. He not only under&s;tood Greek&mdash;Hebrew&mdash;and all the languages which we call learned, but al&s;o all the different jargons, or modern dialects. He accented and pronounced them &s;o naturally, and &s;o perfectly imitated the ge&s;tures and manners both of the &s;everal nations of Europe, and the particular provinces of France, that he might have been taken for a native of all, or of any of the&s;e countries: and this quality he applied to counterfeit all &s;orts of per&s;ons, wherein he &s;ucceeded wonderfully. He was moreover the be&s;t comedian, and the greate&s;t droll that perhaps ever appeared. He had a genius for poetry, and had wrote many ver&s;es. He played upon almo&s;t all in&s;truments&mdash;was a perfect ma&s;ter of mu&s;ic&mdash;and &s;ung mo&s;t agreeably and ju&s;tly. He likewi&s;e could &s;ay ma&s;s, for he was of a di&s;po&s;ition to do, as well as to know, all things. His body was perfectly well &s;uited to his mind. He was light, nimble, and dexterous, and fit for all exerci&s;es. He could ride well, and in dancing, wre&s;t|ling, and leaping, he was admired. There are not any recreative games that he did not know, and he was &s;killed in almo&s;t all mechanic arts. But now for the rever&s;e of the medal. Here it appeared; that he was treacherous&mdash;cruel&mdash;cowardly&mdash;deceitful&mdash;a liar&mdash;a cheat&mdash;a drunkard and a glutton&mdash;a &s;harper in play&mdash;immer&s;ed in every &s;pecies of vice&mdash;a bla&s;phemer&mdash;an athei&s;t.&mdash;In a word&mdash;in him might be found all the vices that are contrary
<PB N="7" REF="019972_0011_0FAD49150A46DFE8">
to nature&mdash;honor&mdash;religion&mdash;and &s;ociety,&mdash;the truth of which he him&s;elf evinced with his late&s;t breath; for he died in the flower of his age, in a common brothel, perfectly corrupted by his debaucheries, and expired with the gla&s;s in his hand, cur&s;ing, and denying God.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. III. p. 216. 217.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT was probably a &s;tate of the human mind &s;uch as has been de&s;cribed, that our Saviour alluded to in the di&s;ciple, who was about to betray him, when he called him "a devil." Perhaps the e&s;&s;ence of depravity in infernal &s;pirits, con&s;i&s;ts in their being wholly devoid of a moral faculty. In them the will has probably lo&s;t the power of chu&s;ing,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Milton &s;eems to have been of this opinion. Hence, after a&s;cribing repentance to Satan, he makes him declare,

<BIBL>PARADISE LOST, Book IV.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE> as well as the inclination of enjoying moral good. It is true, we read of their trembling in a belief of the exi&s;tence of a God, and of their anticipating future puni&s;hment by a&s;king, whether they were to be tormented before their time: But this is the effect of con&s;cience, and hence ari&s;es another argument in favor of this judicial power of the mind, being di&s;tinct from the moral faculty. It would &s;eem as if the Supreme Being had pre&s;erved the moral faculty in man from the ruins of his fall, on purpo&s;e to guide him back again to Paradi&s;e, and at the &s;ame time had con&s;tituted the con&s;cience, both in men and in fallen &s;pirits, a kind of royalty in his moral empire, on purpo&s;e to &s;hew his property in all intelligent crea|tures, and their original re&s;emblance to him&s;elf. Perhaps the e&s;&s;ence
<PB N="8" REF="019972_0012_0FAD4915C7BC1E28">
of moral depravity in man con&s;i&s;ts in a total, but temporary &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of the power of con&s;cience. Per&s;ons in this &s;ituation are em|phatically &s;aid in the &s;criptures to be "pa&s;t feeling"&mdash;and to have their con&s;ciences &s;eared, with a "hot iron"&mdash;they are likewi&s;e &s;aid to be "twice dead"&mdash;that is, the &s;ame torpor or moral in&s;en&s;ibility, has &s;eized both the moral faculty and the con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="5">5. Do we ever ob&s;erve in&s;tances of the exi&s;tence of only <HI>one</HI> of the three intellectual powers of the mind that have been named, in the ab&s;ence of the other two? We ob&s;erve &s;omething of the &s;ame kind with re&s;pect to the moral faculty. I once knew a man, who di&s;covered no one mark of rea&s;on, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the moral &s;en&s;e or faculty in &s;o high a degree, that he &s;pent his whole life in acts of benevolence. He was not only inoffen&s;ive, (which is not always the ca&s;e with idiots) but he was kind, and affectionate to every body. He had no ideas of time, but what were &s;ugge&s;ted to him by the returns of the &s;tated periods for public wor&s;hip, in which he appeared to take great delight. He &s;pent &s;everal hours of every day in devotion, in which he was &s;o careful to be private, that he was once found in the mo&s;t improbable place in the world for that purpo&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in an oven.</P>
<P N="6">6. Do we ob&s;erve the memory, the imagination and the judgment, to be affected by di&s;ea&s;es, particularly by fevers, and madne&s;s? Where is the phy&s;ician, who has not &s;een the moral faculty affected from the &s;ame cau&s;es! How often do we &s;ee the temper wholly changed by a fit of &s;ickne&s;s! And how often do we hear per&s;ons of the mo&s;t delicate virtue, utter &s;peeches in the delirium of a fever,
<PB N="9" REF="019972_0013_0FAD4917593F0EF8">
that are offen&s;ive to decency, or good manners! I have heard a well atte&s;ted hi&s;tory of a clergyman of the mo&s;t exemplary moral character, who &s;pent the la&s;t moments of a fever which deprived him both of his rea&s;on and his life, in profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing. I once attended a young woman in a nervous fever, who di&s;covered after her recovery, a lo&s;s of her former habits of veracity. Her memory (a defect of which, might be &s;u&s;pected of being the cau&s;e of this vice) was in every re&s;pect as perfect as it was before the at|tack of the fever,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;elected this ca&s;e from many others, which have come under my notice, in which the moral faculty appeared to be impaired by di&s;ea&s;es, particularly by the typhus of Dr. Cullen, and by tho&s;e &s;pecies of pal&s;y which affect the brain.</NOTE> The in&s;tances of immorality in maniacs, who were formerly di&s;tingui&s;hed for the oppo&s;ite character, are &s;o nu|merous, and well known&punc; that it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;elect any ca&s;es, to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of the propo&s;ition contained under this head.</P>
<P N="7">7. Do we ob&s;erve any of the three intellectual powers that have been named, enlarged by di&s;ea&s;es? Patients in the delirium of a fever, often di&s;cover extraordinary flights of imagination, and mad|men often a&s;toni&s;h us with their wonderful acts of memory. The &s;ame enlargement, &s;ometimes, appears in the operations of the moral faculty. I have more than once heard the mo&s;t &s;ublime di&s;cour&s;es on morality in the cell of an ho&s;pital, and who has not &s;een in&s;tances of patients in acute di&s;ea&s;es, di&s;covering degrees of benevolence and integrity, that were not natural to them in the ordinary cour&s;e of their lives?</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="10" REF="019972_0014_0FAD4918046DD5B8">
8. Do we ever ob&s;erve a partial in&s;anity, or fal&s;e perception on one &s;ubject, while the judgment is &s;ound and correct, upon all others? We perceive, in &s;ome in&s;tances, a &s;imilar defect in the moral faculty. There are per&s;ons who are moral in the highe&s;t degree, as to certain duties, who neverthele&s;s live under the influence of &s;ome one vice. I knew an in&s;tance of a woman, who was examplary in her obe|dience to every command of the moral law, except one. She could not refrain from &s;tealing. What made this vice the more remarkable was, that &s;he was in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, and not ad|dicted to extravagance in any thing. Such was her propen&s;ity to this vice, that when &s;he could lay her hands upon nothing more valuable, &s;he would often, at the table of a friend, fill her pockets &s;ecretly with bread. As a proof that her judgment was not affected by this defect in her moral faculty, &s;he would both confe&s;s and lament her crime, when detected in it.</P>
<P N="9">9. Do we ob&s;erve the imagination in many in&s;tances to be affected with apprehen&s;ions of dangers that have no exi&s;tence? In like manner we ob&s;erve the moral faculty to di&s;cover a &s;en&s;ibility to vice, that is by no means proportioned to its degrees of depravity. How often do we &s;ee per&s;ons labouring under this morbid &s;en&s;i|bility of the moral faculty, refu&s;e to give a direct an&s;wer to a plain que&s;tion, that related perhaps only to the weather, or to the hour of the day, le&s;t they &s;hould wound the peace of their minds, by telling a fal&s;ehood!</P>
<P N="10">10. Do dreams affect the memory&mdash;the imagination&mdash;and the judgment? Dreams are nothing but incoherent ideas, occa&s;ioned by partial or imperfect &s;leep. There is a variety in the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion
<PB N="11" REF="019972_0015_0FAD491BDC16DB60">
of the powers of the mind in this &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem. In &s;ome ca&s;es the imagination only is deranged in dreams&mdash;in others the memory is affected&mdash;and in others the judgment.&mdash;But there are ca&s;es, in which the change that is produced in the &s;tate of the brain, by means of &s;leep, affects the moral faculty likewi&s;e; hence we &s;ometimes dream of doing and &s;aying things when a&s;leep, which we &s;hudder at, as &s;oon as we awake. This &s;uppo&s;ed defection from virtue, exi&s;ts frequently in dreams where the memory and judgment are &s;carcely impaired. It cannot there|fore be a&s;cribed to the de&s;ertion of tho&s;e two powers of the mind.</P>
<P N="11">11. Do we read in the accounts of travellers of men, who in re&s;pect of intellectual capacity and enjoyments, are but a few degrees above brutes? We read likewi&s;e of a &s;imilar degradation of our &s;pecies, in re&s;pect to moral capacity and feeling. Here it will be nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that the low degrees of moral per|ception, that have been di&s;covered in certain African and Ru&s;&s;ian tribes of men, no more invalidate our propo&s;ition of the univer&s;al and e&s;&s;ential exi&s;tence of a moral faculty in the human mind, than the low &s;tate of their intellects prove, that rea&s;on is not natural to man. Their perceptions of good and evil are in an exact proportion to their intellectual powers. But I will go further, and admit with Mr. Locke,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay concerning the Human Under&s;tanding. Book I. Chap. III.</NOTE> that &s;ome &s;avage nations are totally devoid of the moral faculty, yet it will by no means follow, that this was the original con&s;titution of their minds. The appetite for certain aliments is uniform among all mankind. Where is the nation and the indi|vidual,

in their primitive &s;tate of health, to whom bread is not agreeable? But if we &s;hould find &s;avages, or individuals, who&s;e &s;tomachs have been &s;o di&s;ordered by intemperance, as to refu&s;e this &s;imple and whole&s;ome article of diet, &s;hall we a&s;&s;ert, that this was the original con&s;titution of their appetites?&mdash;By no means. As well might we a&s;&s;ert, becau&s;e &s;avages de&s;troy their beauty by paint|ing, and cutting their faces, that the principles of ta&s;te do not exi&s;t naturally in the human mind. It is with virtue as with fire. It exi&s;ts in the mind, as fire does in certain bodies in a latent or quie&s;cent &s;tate. As colli&s;ion renders the one &s;en&s;ible, &s;o education renders the other vi&s;ible. It would be as ab&s;urd to maintain, becau&s;e olives become agreeable to many people from habit, that we have no natural appetites for any other kind of food, as to a&s;&s;ert that any part of the human &s;pecies exi&s;t without a moral principle, becau&s;e in &s;ome of them, it has wanted cau&s;es to excite it into action, or has been perverted by example. There are appetites that are wholly artificial. There are ta&s;tes &s;o entirely vitiated, as to perceive beauty in deformity. There are torpid and unnatural pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>THE only apology I &s;hall make, for pre&s;uming to differ from that ju&s;tly celebrated oracle, who fir&s;t unfolded to us a map of the intellectual world, &s;hall be, that the eagle eye of genius often darts its views beyond the notice of facts, which are accommodated to the &s;lender organs of perception of men, who po&s;&s;e&s;s no other talent, than that of ob&s;ervation.</P>

IT is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that Mr. Locke has confounded this moral principle with <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> or that Lord Shaft&s;bury has confounded it with <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> &s;ince all three of the&s;e faculties agree in the objects of their approbation, notwith&s;tanding they exi&s;t in the mind inde|pendent of each other. The favorable influence which the progre&s;s of &s;cience and ta&s;te has had upon morals, can be a&s;cribed to nothing el&s;e, but to the perfect union that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in nature between the dictates of rea&s;on&mdash;of ta&s;te&mdash;and of the moral faculty. Why has the &s;pirit of humanity made &s;uch rapid progre&s;s for &s;ome years pa&s;t in the courts of Europe? It is becau&s;e kings and their mini&s;ters have been taught to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> upon philo&s;ophical &s;ubjects.&mdash;Why have indecency and profanity been bani&s;hed from the &s;tage in London and Paris?

<P>IT mu&s;t afford great plea&s;ure to the lovers of virtue, to behold the depth and extent of this moral principle in the human mind. Hap|pily for the human race, the intimations of duty and the road to happine&s;s are not left to the &s;low operations or doubtful inductions of rea&s;on, nor to the precarious deci&s;ions of ta&s;te! Hence we often find the moral faculty in a &s;tate of vigor, in per&s;ons in whom rea&s;on and ta&s;te exi&s;t in a weak, or in an uncultivated &s;tate. It is worthy of notice likewi&s;e, that while <HI>&s;econd</HI> thoughts are be&s;t in matters of judgment, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> thoughts are always to be preferred in matters that relate to morality. <HI>Second</HI> thoughts, in the&s;e ca&s;es, are generally parlies between duty and corrupted inclinations.

IT mu&s;t afford equal plea&s;ure to the lovers of virtue to behold, that our moral conduct and happine&s;s are not committed to the determination of a &s;ingle legi&s;lative power.&mdash;The con&s;cience, like a wi&s;e and faithful council of revi&s;ion, performs the office of a check upon the moral faculty, and thus prevents the fatal con&s;e|quences of immoral actions.</P>
<P>AN objection, I fore&s;ee, will ari&s;e to the doctrine of the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the moral faculty, from its being &s;uppo&s;ed to favor the opinion of the <HI>materiality</HI> of the &s;oul. But I do not &s;ee that this doctrine obliges us to decide upon the que&s;tion of the nature of the &s;oul, any more than the facts which prove the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the memory&mdash;the imagination&mdash;or the judgment. I &s;hall however remark upon this &s;ubject, that the writers in favor of the <HI>immortality</HI> of the &s;oul have done that truth great injury, by connecting it nece&s;&s;arily with its <HI>immateri|ality.</HI> The immortality of the &s;oul depends upon the <HI>will</HI> of the Deity, and not upon the &s;uppo&s;ed properties of &s;pirit. Matter is in its own nature as immortal as &s;pirit. It is re&s;olvable by heat and mixture into a variety of forms; but it requires the &s;ame Almighty hand to annihilate it, that it did to create it. I know of no ar|guments to prove the immortality of the &s;oul, but &s;uch as are derived from the chri&s;tian revelation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Life and immortality <HI>are</HI> brought to light <HI>only</HI> through the Go&s;pel." 2 Tim.

immortality of the &s;oul, from the greatne&s;s of its capacity for knowledge and happine&s;s, or from its dread of annihilation.</P>
<P>NOR let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, from any thing that has been &s;aid, that I entertain an idea of the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the freedom of the will. I believe in the pre&s;cience of the Deity, becau&s;e I conceive this attribute to be in&s;eparable from his per|fections; and I believe in the freedom of moral agency in man, becau&s;e I conceive it to be e&s;&s;ential to his nature as a re&s;pon&s;ible being. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where the moral faculty is deprived of its freedom, by involuntary di&s;ea&s;es, I conceive that man cea&s;es as much to be a &s;ubject of moral government, as he does to be a &s;ubject of civil government, when he is deprived by involuntary di&s;ea&s;es, of the u&s;e of his rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I REMARKED in the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, that per&s;ons who were deprived of the ju&s;t exerci&s;e of memory&mdash;imagination&mdash;or judgment, were proper &s;ubjects of medicine; and that there are many ca&s;es upon record which prove, that the di&s;ea&s;es from the derangement of the&s;e faculties, have yielded to the healing art.</P>
<P>IT is perhaps only becau&s;e the di&s;orders of the moral faculty, have not been traced to a connection with phy&s;ical cau&s;es, that medical writers have neglected to give them a place in their &s;y&s;tems of no&s;ology, and that &s;o few attempts have been hitherto made, to le&s;&s;en or remove them by phy&s;ical as well as rational and moral remedies.</P>

I SHALL not attempt to derive any &s;upport to my opinions, from the analogy of the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the temper and conduct of brute animals. The facts which I &s;hall produce in favor of the action of the&s;e cau&s;es upon morals in the human &s;pecies, will, I hope, render unnece&s;&s;ary the arguments that might be drawn from that quarter.</P>
<P>I AM aware, that in venturing upon this &s;ubject, I &s;tep upon untrodden ground.&mdash;I feel as AEneas did, when he was about to enter the gates of Avernus, but without a Sybil to in&s;truct me in the my&s;teries that are before me. I fore&s;ee, that men who have been educated in the mechanical habits of adopting popular or e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions, will revolt at the doctrine I am about to de|liver&mdash;while men of &s;en&s;e and genius will hear my propo&s;itions with candor, and if they do not adopt them, will commend that boldne&s;s of enquiry, that prompted me to broach them.</P>
<P>I SHALL begin with an attempt to &s;upply the defects of no&s;o|logical writers, by naming the partial or weakened action of the moral faculty, MICRONOMIA. The total ab&s;ence of this faculty, I &s;hall call ANOMIA. By the law, referred to in the&s;e new genera of ve&s;aniae, I mean the law of nature written in the human heart, and which we formerly quoted from the writings of St. Paul.</P>
<P>IN treating of the effects of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the moral faculty, it might help to extend our ideas upon this &s;ubject, to reduce virtues and vices to certain &s;pecies, and to point out the effects of particular cau&s;es, upon each particular &s;pecies of virtue
<PB N="17" REF="019972_0021_0FAD4920662F8728">
and vice, but this would lead us into a field too exten&s;ive for the limits of the pre&s;ent enquiry. I &s;hall only hint at a few ca&s;es, and have no doubt but the ingenuity of my auditors will &s;upply my &s;ilence, by applying the re&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is immaterial, whether the phy&s;ical cau&s;es that are to be enumerated, act upon the moral faculty through the medium of the &s;en&s;es&mdash;the pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;the memory&mdash;or the imagination. Their influence is equally certain, whether they act as remote, pre|di&s;po&s;ing, or occa&s;ional cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE effects of CLIMATE upon the moral faculty claim our fir&s;t attention. Not only individuals, but nations, derive a con&s;iderable part of their moral, as well as intellectual character, from the dif|ferent portions they enjoy of the rays of the &s;un. Revenge&mdash;levity timidity&mdash;and indolence, tempered with occa&s;ional emotions of be|nevolence, are the moral qualities of the inhabitants of warm cli|mates, while &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s tempered with &s;incerity and integrity, form the moral character of the inhabitants of cold countries. The &s;tate of the weather, and the &s;ea&s;ons of the year al&s;o, have a vi&s;ible effect upon moral &s;en&s;ibility. The month of November, in Great Britain, rendered gloomy by con&s;tant fogs and rains, has been thought to favor the perpetration of the wor&s;t &s;pecies of murder, while the vernal &s;un, in middle latitudes, has been as generally remarked for producing gentlene&s;s and benevolence.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE effects of DIET upon the moral faculty are more certain, though le&s;s attended to, than the effects of climate. <Q>Fullne&s;s of bread,</Q> we are told, was one of the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es of the
<PB N="18" REF="019972_0022_0FAD49210D6F1E10">
vices of the cities of the plain. The fa&s;ts &s;o often inculcated among the Jews, were intended to le&s;&s;en the incentives to vice; for pride&mdash;cruelty&mdash;and &s;en&s;uality, are as much the natural con&s;equences of luxury, as apoplexies and pal&s;ies. But the <HI>quality</HI> as well as the quantity of aliment, has an influence upon morals; hence we find the moral di&s;ea&s;es that have been mentioned, are mo&s;t frequently the off&s;pring of animal food. The elegant prophet I&s;aiah &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of this, when he a&s;cribes &s;uch &s;alutary effects to a temperate and vegetable diet. <Q>Butter and honey &s;hall he eat, &s;ays he, <HI>that</HI> he may know to refu&s;e the evil, and to chu&s;e the good.</Q>&mdash;But we have many facts which prove the efficacy of a vegetable diet upon the pa&s;&s;ions. Dr. Ar|buthnot a&s;&s;ures us, that he cured &s;everal patients of ira&s;cible tem|pers, by nothing but a pre&s;cription of this &s;imple and temperate regimen.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE effects of CERTAIN DRINKS upon the moral faculty are not le&s;s ob&s;ervable, than upon the intellectual powers of the mind. Fermented liquors of a good quality, and taken in a moderate quantity, are favorable to the virtues of candor, benevolence and genero&s;ity; but when they are taken in exce&s;s, or when they are of a bad quality, and drank even in a moderate quantity, they &s;eldom fail of rou&s;ing every latent &s;park of vice into action. The la&s;t of the&s;e facts is &s;o notorious, that when a man is ob&s;erved to be ill-natured or quarrel&s;ome in Portugal, after drinking, it is common in that country to &s;ay, that "he has drank bad wine." While occa|&s;ional fits of intoxication produce ill temper in many people, ha|bitual drunkenne&s;s (which is generally produced by di&s;tilled
<PB N="19" REF="019972_0023_0FAD4921CB352BD0">
&s;pirits) never fails to eradicate veracity and integrity from the human mind. Perhaps this may be the rea&s;on why the Spaniards, in ancient times, never admitted a man's evidence in a court of ju&s;tice, who had been convicted of drunkenne&s;s.&mdash;Water is the univer&s;al &s;edative of turbulent of pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;it not only promotes a general equanimity of temper, but it compo&s;es anger. I have heard &s;everal well atte&s;ted ca&s;es, of a draught of cold water having &s;uddenly compo&s;ed this violent pa&s;&s;ion, after the u&s;ual remedies of rea&s;on had been applied to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. EXTREME HUNGER produces the mo&s;t unfriendly effects upon moral &s;en&s;ibility. It is immaterial, whether it acts by in|ducing a relaxation of the &s;olids, or an acrimony of the fluids, or by the combined operation of both tho&s;e phy&s;ical cau&s;es. The Indians in this country what their appetites for that &s;avage &s;pe|cies of war, which is peculiar to them, by the &s;timulus of hunger; hence, we are told, they always return meagre and emaciated from their military excur&s;ions. In civilized life we often behold this &s;en&s;ation an overbalance for the re&s;traints of moral feeling; and perhaps this may be the rea&s;on, why poverty, which is the mo&s;t frequent parent of hunger, di&s;po&s;es &s;o generally to theft; for the character of hunger is taken from that vice&mdash;It belongs to it <Q>to break through &s;tone walls.</Q> So much does this &s;en&s;ation predo|minate over rea&s;on and moral feeling, that Cardinal De Retz &s;ug|ge&s;ts to politicians, never to ri&s;k a motion in a popular a&s;&s;embly, however wi&s;e or ju&s;t it may be, immediately before dinner.&mdash;That temper mu&s;t be uncommonly guarded, which is not di&s;turbed by long ab&s;tinence from food. One of the worthie&s;t men I ever knew, who made his breakfa&s;t his principal meal, was peevi&s;h and
<PB N="20" REF="019972_0024_0FAD49228D996648">
di&s;agreeable to his friends and family, from the time he left his bed, till he &s;at down to his morning repa&s;t, after which, chearfulne&s;s &s;parkled in his countenance, and he became the delight of all around him.</P>
<P N="5">5. I HINTED formerly, in proving the analogy between the ef|fects of DISEASES upon the intellects, and upon the moral faculty, that the latter was frequently impaired by fevers and madne&s;s. I beg leave to add further upon this head, that not only fevers and madne&s;s, but the hy&s;teria and hypochondria&s;is, as well as all tho&s;e &s;tates of the body, whether idiopathic or &s;ymptomatic, which are accompanied with preternatural irritability&mdash;&s;en&s;ibility&mdash;torpor&mdash;&s;tupor&mdash;or mobility of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, di&s;po&s;e to vice, either of the body or of the mind. It is in vain to attack the&s;e vices with lectures upon morality. They are only to be cured by medi|cine,&mdash;particularly by exerci&s;e,&mdash;the cold bath,&mdash;and by a cold or a warm atmo&s;phere. The young woman, who&s;e ca&s;e I mentioned formerly, that lo&s;t her habit of veracity by a nervous fever, re|covered this virtue, as &s;oon as her &s;y&s;tem recovered its natural tone, from the cold weather which happily &s;ucceeded her fever.</P>
<P N="6">6. IDLENESS is the parent of every vice. It is mentioned in the old te&s;tament as another of the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es of the vices of the cities of the plain. LABOR of all kinds, favors and faci|litates the practice of virtue. The country life is a happy life; chiefly, becau&s;e its laborious employments are favorable to virtue, and unfriendly to vice. It is a common practice, I have been told, for the planters in the Southern States, to con&s;ign an hou&s;e &s;lave, who has become vicious from idlene&s;s, to the drudgery of the field,
<PB N="21" REF="019972_0025_0FAD4923B662AF08">
in order to reform him. The Bridewells and workhou&s;es of all civilized countries prove, that LABOR is not only a very &s;evere, but the mo&s;t benevolent of all puni&s;hments, in as much as it is one of the mo&s;t &s;uitable means of reformation. Mr. Howard tells us in his hi&s;tory of pri&s;ons, that in Holland it is a common &s;aying, "Make men work, and you will make them hone&s;t." And over the ra&s;p and &s;pin-hou&s;e at Groeningen, this &s;entiment is expre&s;&s;ed (he tells us) by a happy motto&mdash;
<Q><L>"Vitiorum &s;emina&mdash;otium&mdash;labore exhauriendum."</L></Q>
The effects of &s;teady labor in early life, in creating virtuous habits, is &s;till more remarkable. The late Anthony Benezet of this city, who&s;e benevolence was the &s;entinel of the virtue, as well as of the happine&s;s of his country, made it a con&s;tant rule in binding out poor children, to avoid putting them into wealthy families, but always preferred ma&s;ters for them who worked them&s;elves, and who obliged the&s;e children to work in their pre&s;ence. If the habits of virtue, contracted by means of this apprentice&s;hip to labor, are purely mechanical, their effects are, neverthele&s;s, the &s;ame upon the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, as if they flowed from principle. The mind, moreover, when pre&s;erved by the&s;e means from weeds, becomes a more mellow &s;oil afterwards, for moral and rational improvement.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE effects of EXCESSIVE SLEEP are intimately connected with the effects of idlene&s;s, upon the moral faculty,&mdash;hence we find that moderate, and even &s;canty portions of &s;leep, in every part of the world, have been found to be friendly, not only to health and long life, but in many in&s;tances to morality. The practice of the Monks, who often &s;leep upon a floor, and who generally ri&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="019972_0026_0FAD4924087DC078">
with the &s;un, for the &s;ake of mortifying their &s;en&s;ual appetites, is certainly founded in wi&s;dom, and has often produced the mo&s;t &s;alutary moral effects.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE effects of BODILY PAIN upon the moral, are not le&s;s remarkable than upon the intellectual powers of the mind. The late Dr. Gregory of the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, u&s;ed to tell his pupils, that he always found his perceptions quicker in a fit of the gout, than at any other time. The pangs which attend the di&s;&s;o|lution of the body, are often accompanied with conceptions and expre&s;&s;ions upon the mo&s;t ordinary &s;ubjects, that di&s;cover an un|common elevation of the intellectual powers. The effects of bodily pain are exactly the &s;ame in rou&s;ing and directing the moral faculty. Bodily pain, we find, was one of the remedies employed in the old te&s;tament, for extirpating vice and promoting virtue: and Mr. Howard tells us, that he &s;aw it employed &s;ucce&s;sfully as a means of reformation, in one of the pri&s;ons which he vi&s;ited. If pain has a phy&s;ical tendency to cure vice, I &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of parents and legi&s;lators, whether moderate degrees of corporal puni&s;hments, inflicted for a great length of time, would not be more medicinal in their effects, than the violent degrees of them, which are of &s;hort duration.</P>
<P N="9">9. Too much cannot be &s;aid in favor of CLEANLINESS, as a phy&s;ical mean of promoting virtue. The writings of Mo&s;es have been called by military men, the be&s;t "orderly book" in the world. In every part of them we find cleanline&s;s inculcated with as much zeal, as if it was part of the moral, in&s;tead of the levitical law. Now, it is well known, that the principal de&s;ign of every precept
<PB N="23" REF="019972_0027_0FAD4924CC097B60">
and rite of the ceremonial parts of the Jewi&s;h religion, was to prevent vice, and to promote virtue. All writers upon the lepro&s;y, take notice of its connection with a certain vice. To this di&s;ea&s;e gro&s;s animal food, particularly &s;wine's fle&s;h, and a dirty &s;kin, have been thought to be predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es&mdash;hence the rea&s;on, pro|bably, why pork was forbidden, and why ablutions of the body and limbs were &s;o frequently inculcated by the Jewi&s;h law. Sir John Pringle's remarks, in his Oration upon Capt. Cook's Voyage, delivered before the Royal Society in London, are very pertinent to this part of our &s;ubject.&mdash;<Q>Cleanline&s;s (&s;ays he) is conducive to health, but it is not &s;o obvious, that it al&s;o tends to good order and other virtues. Such (meaning the &s;hip's crew) as were made more cleanly, became more &s;ober,&mdash;more orderly,&mdash;and more attentive to duty,</Q> Mr. Addi&s;on, who&s;e ob&s;ervations are &s;eldom fal&s;e, and never trifling, tells us, that <Q>&s;everal vices, de|&s;tructive both to body and mind, are incon&s;i&s;tent with the habit of cleanline&s;s.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spectator, No. 631.</NOTE> The benefit to be derived by parents and &s;choolma&s;ters from attending to the&s;e facts, is too obvious to be mentioned.</P>
<P N="10">10. I HOPE I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in placing SOLITUDE among the phy&s;ical cau&s;es which influence the moral faculty, when I add, that I confine its effects to per&s;ons who are irreclaimable by rational or moral remedies. Mr. Howard informs us, that the chaplain of the pri&s;on at Liege in Germany a&s;&s;ured him, <Q>that the mo&s;t refractory and turbulent &s;pirits, became tractable and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, by being clo&s;ely confined for four or five days.</Q>&mdash;In bodies that are predi&s;po&s;ed to vice, the &s;timulus of cheerful, but much more of profane &s;ociety and conver&s;ation, upon the animal
<PB N="24" REF="019972_0028_0FAD492585067BD8">
&s;pirits, becomes an exciting cau&s;e, and like the &s;troke of the flint upon the &s;teel, renders the &s;parks of vice both active and vi&s;ible. By removing men out of the reach of this exciting cau&s;e, they are often reformed, e&s;pecially if they are confined long enough to pro|duce a &s;ufficient cha&s;m in their habits of vice. Where the benefit of reflection, and in&s;truction from books, can be added to &s;olitude and confinement, their good effects are &s;till more certain. To this philo&s;ophers and poets in every age have a&s;&s;ented, by de&s;cribing the life of a hermit as a life of pa&s;&s;ive virtue.</P>
<P N="11">11. CONNECTED with &s;olitude, as a mechanical means of pro|moting virtue, SILENCE de&s;erves to be mentioned in this place. The late Dr. Fothergill, in his plan of education for that bene|volent in&s;titution at Ackworth, which was the la&s;t care of his u&s;e|ful life, &s;ays every thing that can be &s;aid in favor of this nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cipline, in the following words. <Q>To habituate children from their early infancy, to &s;ilence and attention, is of the greate&s;t ad|vantage to them, not only as a preparative to their advancement in a religious life, but as the groundwork of a well cultivated under&s;tanding. To have the active minds of children put under a kind of re&s;traint&mdash;to be accu&s;tomed to turn their attention from external objects, and habituated to a degree of ab&s;tracted quiet, is a matter of great con&s;equence, and la&s;ting benefit to them. Although it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that young and active minds are always engaged in &s;ilence as they ought to be, yet to be accu&s;tomed thus to quietne&s;s, is no &s;mall point gained to|wards fixing a habit of patience, and recollection, which &s;eldom for&s;akes tho&s;e who have been properly in&s;tructed in this entrance of the &s;chool of wi&s;dom, during the re&s;idue of their days.</Q></P>

<P N="12">12. THE effects of MUSIC upon the moral faculty, have been felt and recorded in every country. Hence we are able to di&s;cover the virtues and vices of different nations, by their tunes, as certainly as by their laws. The effects of mu&s;ic, when &s;imply mechanical, upon the pa&s;&s;ions, are powerful and exten&s;ive. But it remains yet to determine the degrees of moral exta&s;y, that may be produced by an attack upon the ear. the rea&s;on, and the moral principle, at the &s;ame time, by the combined powers of mu&s;ic and eloquence.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE ELOQUENCE OF THE PULPIT is nearly allied to mu&s;ic in its effects upon the moral faculty. It is true, there can be no permanent change in the temper, and moral conduct of a man, that is not derived from the under&s;tanding and the will; but we mu&s;t remember, that the&s;e two powers of the mind are mo&s;t a&s;&s;ailable, when they are attacked through the avenue of the pa&s;&s;ions; and the&s;e, we know, when agitated by the powers of eloquence, exert a mechanical action upon every power of the &s;oul. Hence we find in every age and country, where chri&s;tianity has been propagated, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed orators have generally been the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful reformers of mankind. There mu&s;t be a defect of eloquence in a preacher, who with the re&s;ources for oratory, which are contained in the old and new te&s;taments, does not produce in every man who hears him, at lea&s;t a temporary love of virtue. I grant that the eloquence of the pulpit alone, cannot change men into chri&s;tians, but it certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of changing brutes

into men. Could the eloquence of the &s;tage be properly directed, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the extent of its mechanical effects upon morals. The language and imagery of a Shake&s;pear, upon moral and religious &s;ubjects, poured upon the pa&s;&s;ions and the &s;en&s;es, in all the beauty and variety of dramatic repre&s;entation!&mdash;Who could re&s;i&s;t,&mdash;or de&s;cribe their effects?</P>
<P N="14">14. ODORS of various kinds have been ob&s;erved to act in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner upon the moral faculty. Brydone tells us, upon the authority of a celebrated philo&s;opher in Italy, that the peculiar wick|edne&s;s of the people who live in the neighbourhood of AEtna and Ve|&s;uvius, is occa&s;ioned chiefly by the &s;mell of the &s;ulphur and of the hot exhalations which are con&s;tantly di&s;charged from tho&s;e volcanos. Agreeable odors, &s;eldom fail to in&s;pire &s;erenity, and to com|po&s;e the angry &s;pirits&mdash;Hence the plea&s;ure, and one of the advantages of a flower garden. The &s;moke of tobacco is likewi&s;e of a &s;edative nature, and tends not only to produce what is called a train in perception, but to hu&s;h the agitated pa&s;&s;ions into &s;ilence and order.&mdash;Hence the propriety of connecting the pipe or &s;egar and the bottle together, in public company.</P>

IT is to be lamented, that no experiments have as yet been made, to determine the effects of all the different &s;pecies of AIRS, which chemi&s;try has lately di&s;covered, upon the moral faculty.

16. WHAT &s;hall we &s;ay of the effects of MEDICINES upon the moral faculty?&mdash;That many &s;ub&s;tances in the materia medica act upon the intellects, is well known to phy&s;icians. Why &s;hould it be thought impo&s;&s;ible for medicines, to act in like manner upon the moral faculty? May not the earth contain in its bowels, or upon its &s;urface, antidotes to all our moral, as well as natural di&s;ea&s;es?&mdash;Let tho&s;e, who refu&s;e to follow me in this conjecture, recollect, that moral evil was introduced into our minds&mdash;as well as natural evil into our bodies&mdash;by eating an apple.</P>
<P>LET it not be &s;u&s;pected from any thing that I have delivered, that I &s;uppo&s;e the influence of phy&s;ical cau&s;es upon the moral faculty, renders the agency of divine influence unnece&s;&s;ary to our moral happine&s;s. I only maintain, that the operations of the divine government are carried on in the moral, as in the natural world,&mdash;by the in&s;trumentality of &s;econd cau&s;es. I have only trodden in the foot&s;teps of the in&s;pired writers; for mo&s;t of the phy&s;ical cau&s;es I have enumerated, are connected with moral pre|cepts, or have been u&s;ed as the means of reformation from vice, in the old and new te&s;taments. To the ca&s;es that have been men|tioned I &s;hall only add, that Nebuchadnezzar was cured of his pride, by means of &s;olitude and a vegetable diet.&mdash;Saul was cured of his evil &s;pirit, by means of David's harp&mdash;and St. Paul expre&s;sly &s;ays, <Q>I keep my body under, and bring it into &s;ubjection, left that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t away.</Q> But I will go one &s;tep further, and add in favor of divine influence upon the moral principle, that in tho&s;e extraor|dinary ca&s;es, where bad men are &s;uddenly reformed, without the in&s;trumentality of phy&s;ical&mdash;moral&mdash;or rational cau&s;es, I believe
<PB N="28" REF="019972_0032_0FAD492C0CCB6FB8">
that the organization of tho&s;e parts of the body, which form the link that binds it to the &s;oul, undergoes a phy&s;ical change<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Paul was &s;uddenly transformed from a per&s;ecutor, into a man of a gentle and amiable &s;pirit. The manner in which this change was effected upon his mind, he tells us in the following words&mdash;<Q>Neither circumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor un-circumci&s;ion, but the new creature.&mdash;From hence forth let no man trouble me; for I bear in <HI>my body,</HI> the <HI>marks</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us.</Q> Galatians, VI. 15. 17.</NOTE>; and hence the expre&s;&s;ions of a "new creature," which are made u&s;e of in the &s;criptures to denote this change, are proper in a literal, as well as a figurative &s;en&s;e. It is probably the beginning of that perfect renovation of the human body, which is predicted by St. Paul in the following words&mdash;<Q>For our conver&s;ation is in heaven,&mdash;from whence we look for the Saviour, who &s;hall change our VILE BODIES, that they may be fa&s;hioned according to his own glorious body.</Q></P>
<P>I CANNOT help remarking under this head, that if the con|ditions of tho&s;e parts of the human body, which are connected with the &s;oul, influence morals, the &s;ame rea&s;on may be given for a virtuous education, that has been admitted for teaching mu&s;ic and the pronunciation of foreign languages, in the early and yielding &s;tate of tho&s;e organs, which form the voice and &s;peech. Such is the effect of a moral education, that we often &s;ee its fruits in the advanced &s;tages of life, after the religious principles which were connected with it, have been renounced. Ju&s;t as we perceive the &s;ame care in a &s;urgeon in his attendance upon his patients, after the &s;ympathy which fir&s;t produced this care, has cea&s;ed to operate upon his mind.&mdash;The boa&s;ted morality of the Dei&s;ts, is I believe, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, the off&s;pring of habits, produced originally by the prin|ciples
<PB N="29" REF="019972_0033_0FAD492D01C30108">
and precepts of chri&s;tianity.&mdash;Hence appears the wi&s;dom of Solomon's advice&mdash;<Q>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will not</Q>&mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid,&mdash;he can|not "depart from it."</P>
<P>THUS have I enumerated the principal cau&s;es, which act me|chanically upon morals. If, from the combined action of phy&s;ical powers that are oppo&s;ed to each other, the moral faculty &s;hould become &s;tationary, or if the virtue or vice produced by them, &s;hould form a neutral quality, compo&s;ed of both of them, I hope it will not call in que&s;tion the truth of our general propo&s;itions. I have only mentioned the effects of phy&s;ical cau&s;es in a &s;imple &s;tate.</P>
<P>IT might help to enlarge our ideas upon this &s;ubject, to take notice of the influence of the different &s;tages of &s;ociety&mdash;of agri|culture, and commerce&mdash;of &s;oil and &s;ituation&mdash;of the different degrees of cultivation of ta&s;te, and of the intellectual powers&mdash;of the different forms of government&mdash;and la&s;tly of the different profe&s;&s;ions and occupations of mankind, upon the moral faculty; but as the&s;e act indirectly only, and by the intervention of cau&s;es that are unconnected with matter, I conceive they are foreign to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre&s;ent enquiry. If they &s;hould vary the action of the &s;imple phy&s;ical cau&s;es in any degree, I hope it will not call in que&s;tion the truth of our general propo&s;itions, any more than the compound action of phy&s;ical powers, that are oppo&s;ed to each other. There remain only a few more cau&s;es which are of a com|pound nature, but &s;o nearly related to tho&s;e, which are purely
<PB N="30" REF="019972_0034_0FAD492D0DA36CB0">
mechanical, that I &s;hall beg leave to tre&s;pa&s;s upon your patience, by giving them a place in my oration.</P>
<P>THE effects of IMITATION&mdash;HABIT&mdash;and ASSOCIATION upon morals, would furni&s;h ample matter for inve&s;tigation. Con|&s;idering how much the &s;hape, texture, and conditions of the human body, influence morals, I &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of the ingenious, whether in our endeavours to imitate moral examples, &s;ome advantage may not be derived, from our copying the features and external manners of the originals. What makes the &s;ucce&s;s of this experiment probable is, that we generally find men, who&s;e faces re&s;emble each other, have the &s;ame manners and di&s;po&s;itions. I infer the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s in an attempt to imitate originals in the manner that has been mentioned, from the facility with which dome&s;tics acquire a re&s;emblance to their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;ses, not only in manners, but in countenance, in tho&s;e ca&s;es where they are tied to them, by re&s;pect, and affection.&mdash;Hu&s;bands and wives al&s;o, where they po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame &s;pecies of face, under circum&s;tances of mutual attachment, often acquire a re&s;emblance to each other.</P>
<P>FROM the general dete&s;tation in which hypocri&s;y is held both by good and bad men, the mechanical effects of HABIT upon virtue, have not been &s;ufficiently explored. There are, I am per&s;uaded, many in&s;tances, where virtues have been a&s;&s;umed by accident, or nece&s;&s;ity, which have become real from habit, and afterwards de|rived their nouri&s;hment from the heart. Hence the wi&s;dom of Hamlet's advice to his mother&mdash;
<Q><L>A&s;&s;ume a virtue, if you have it not,</L>
<L>That mon&s;ter, cu&s;tom, who all &s;en&s;e doth eat,</L>

<P>THE influence of ASSOCIATION upon morals, opens an ample field for enquiry. It is from this principle, that we explain the reformation from theft and drunkenne&s;s in &s;ervants which we &s;ome|times &s;ee produced by a draught of &s;pirits in which tartar emetic had been &s;ecretly di&s;&s;olved. The recollection of the pain and &s;ickne&s;s excited by the emetic, naturally a&s;&s;ociates it&s;elf with the &s;pirits, &s;o as to render them both equally the objects of aver&s;ion. It is by calling in this principle only, that we can account for the conduct of Mo&s;es, in grinding the golden calf into a powder, and afterwards di&s;&s;olving it (probably by means of hepar &s;ulphuris) in water, and compelling the children of I&s;rael to drink of it, as a puni&s;h|ment for their idolatry. This mixture is bitter and nau&s;eating in the highe&s;t degree. It could not be remembered therefore, by them, without being a&s;&s;ociated with an equal abhorrence of their folly and wickedne&s;s. The benefit of corporal puni&s;hments, when they are of a &s;hort duration, depends in part upon their being connected by time and place, with the crimes for which they are inflicted. Quick as the thunder follows the lightning, if it were po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould puni&s;hments follow crimes, and the advantage of
<PB N="32" REF="019972_0036_0FAD492E90091270">
a&s;&s;ociation would be more certain, if the &s;pot where they were committed, were made the theatre of their expiation. It is from the effects of this a&s;&s;ociation, probably, that the change of place and company produced by exile and tran&s;portation, has &s;o often reclaimed bad men, after moral&mdash;rational&mdash;and phy&s;ical means of reformation had been u&s;ed to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>AS SENSIBILITY is the avenue to the moral faculty, every thing which tends to dimini&s;h it, tends al&s;o, to injure morals.&mdash;The Romans owed much of their corruption to the &s;ights of the conte&s;ts of their gladiators, and of criminals, with wild bea&s;ts. For the&s;e rea|&s;ons, executions &s;hould never be public. Indeed, I believe there are few public puni&s;hments of any kind, that do not harden the hearts of &s;pectators, and thereby le&s;&s;en the natural horror which all crimes at fir&s;t excite in the human mind.</P>
<P>CRUELTY to brute animals is another means of de&s;troying moral &s;en&s;ibility. The ferocity of &s;avages has been a&s;cribed in part to their peculiar mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Mr. Hogarth points out in his ingenious prints, the connection between cruelty to brute animals in youth, and murder in manhood. The Emperor Domitian pre|pared his mind by the amu&s;ement of killing flies, for all tho&s;e bloody crimes which afterwards di&s;graced his reign. I am &s;o per|fectly &s;atisfied of the truth of a connection between morals, and humanity to brutes, that I &s;hall find it difficult to re&s;train my idolatry for that legi&s;lature, that &s;hall fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem of laws, to defend them from outrage and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="019972_0037_0FAD492F4DE7D080">
IN order to pre&s;erve the vigor of the moral faculty, it is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to keep young people as ignorant as po&s;&s;ible of tho&s;e crimes, that are generally thought mo&s;t di&s;graceful to human nature. Suicide, I believe, is often propagated by means of news|papers. For this rea&s;on, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee the proceedings of our courts kept from the public eye, when they expo&s;e, or puni&s;h mon&s;trous vices.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t mechanical method of promoting morality that I &s;hall mention, is to keep &s;en&s;ibility alive, by a familiarity with &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s from poverty and di&s;ea&s;e. Compa&s;&s;ion never awakens in the human bo&s;om, without being accompanied with a train of &s;i&s;ter virtues&mdash;hence the wi&s;e man ju&s;tly remarks, that <Q>By the &s;ad|ne&s;s of the countenance, the heart is made better.</Q></P>

Here the feeling heart&mdash;the tearful eye&mdash;and the charitable hand, may always be connected together, and the flame of &s;ympathy, in&s;tead of being extingui&s;hed in taxes, or expiring in a &s;olitary blaze by a &s;ingle contribution, may be kept
<PB N="34" REF="019972_0038_0FAD493005B1B3E0">
alive, by con&s;tant exerci&s;e. There is a nece&s;&s;ary connection be|tween animal &s;ympathy and morals. The prie&s;t and the levite, in the new te&s;tament, would probably have relieved the poor man who fell among thieves, had accident brought them near enough to exa|mine his wounds. The unfortunate Mrs. Bellamy was re&s;cued from the dreadful purpo&s;e of drowning her&s;elf, by nothing but the di&s;tre&s;s of a child, rending the air with its cries for bread. It is probably owing in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the connection between mo|rals and &s;ympathy, that the fair &s;ex in every age, and country, have been more di&s;tingui&s;hed for virtue, than men&mdash;for who ever heard of a woman, devoid of humanity?&mdash;</P>
<P>LASTLY, ATTRACTION, COMPOSITION, and DECOMPOSI|TION, belong to the pa&s;&s;ions as well as to matter. Vices of the &s;ame &s;pecies attract each other with the mo&s;t force&mdash;hence the bad con&s;equences of crouding young men (who&s;e propen&s;ities are generally the &s;ame) under one roof, in our modern plans of education. The effects of compo&s;ition and decompo&s;ition upon vices, appear in the meanne&s;s of the &s;chool boy, being often cured by the prodigality of a military life, and by the precipitation of avarice, which is often produced by ambition and love.</P>
<P>IF phy&s;ical cau&s;es influence morals in the manner we have de|&s;cribed, may they not al&s;o influence religious principles and opini|ons?&mdash;I an&s;wer in the affirmative; and I have authority, from the records of phy&s;ic, as well as from my own ob&s;ervations, to declare, that religious melancholy and madne&s;s, in all their variety of &s;pecies, yield with more facility to medicine, than &s;imply to polemical di&s;|cour&s;es, or to ca&s;ui&s;tical advice.&mdash;But this &s;ubject is foreign to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre&s;ent enquiry.</P>

<P>THE extent of the moral powers and habits in man is unknown. It is not improbable, but the human mind contains principles of virtue, which have never yet been excited into action.

He publi&s;hed many excellent tracts again&s;t the African trade, again&s;t war, and the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, and one in favor of civili&s;ing and chri&s;tiani&s;ing the Indians. He wrote to the queen of Great-Britain, and the queen of Portugal, to u&s;e their influence in their re&s;pective courts to aboli&s;h the African trade. He al&s;o wrote an affectionate let|ter to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, to di&s;&s;uade him from making war. The hi&s;tory of his life af|fords a remarkable in&s;tance how much it is po&s;&s;ible for an individual to accompli&s;h in the world; and that the mo&s;t humble &s;tations do not preclude good men from the mo&s;t exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s. He bequeathed his e&s;tate (after the death of his widow) to the &s;upport of a &s;chool for the education of negro children, which he had founded and taught for &s;everal years before he died. He departed this life in May 1784, in the 71&s;t year of his age, in the meridian of his u&s;efulne&s;s, univer&s;ally lamented by per&s;ons of all ranks and denominations.</NOTE>&mdash;</P>
<P>I RETURN from this digre&s;&s;ion, to addre&s;s my&s;elf in a particular manner to you, VENERABLE SAGES, and FELLOW CITIZENS in the REPUBLIC of LETTERS.&mdash;The influence of philo&s;ophy, we have been told, has already been felt in courts. To increa&s;e, and complete this influence, there is nothing more nece&s;&s;ary, than for the nume|rous literary &s;ocieties in Europe and America, to add the SCIENCE of MORALS to their experiments and enquiries. The godlike &s;cheme of Henry the IV. of France, and of the illu&s;trious Queen Elizabeth of England, for e&s;tabli&s;hing a perpetual peace in Europe, may be accompli&s;hed without a &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence, by a confederation of learned men, and learned &s;ocieties. It is in their power, by multiplying the objects of human rea&s;on, to bring the monarchs

and rulers of the world, under their &s;ubjection, and thereby to extirpate war&mdash;&s;lavery&mdash;and capital puni&s;hments, from the li&s;t of human evils. Let it not be &s;u&s;pected that I detract by this de|claration, from the honor of the chri&s;tian religion. It is true&mdash;chri&s;tianity was propagated without the aid of human learning; but this was one of tho&s;e miracles, which was nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h it, and which, by repetition, would cea&s;e to be a miracle. They mi&s;|repre&s;ent the chri&s;tian religion, who &s;uppo&s;e it to be wholly an internal revelation, and addre&s;&s;ed only to the moral powers of the mind. The truths of chri&s;tianity afford the greate&s;t &s;cope for the human under&s;tanding, and they will become intelligible to us, only in proportion as the human genius is &s;tretched by means of philo|&s;ophy, to its utmo&s;t dimen&s;ions. Errors may be oppo&s;ed to errors: but truths, upon all &s;ubjects, mutually &s;upport each other. And perhaps one rea&s;on, why &s;ome parts of the chri&s;tian revelation are &s;till involved in ob&s;curity, may be occa&s;ioned by our imperfect knowledge of the phaenomena, and laws of nature. The truths of philo&s;ophy and chri&s;tianity, dwell alike in the mind of the Deity, and rea&s;on and religion are equally the off&s;pring of his goodne&s;s. They mu&s;t, therefore, &s;tand and fall together. By rea&s;on, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, I mean the power of judging of truth, as well as the power of comprehending it. Happy aera!&mdash;When the divine and the philo&s;opher &s;hall embrace each other, and unite their labors, for the reformation and happine&s;s of mankind!&mdash;</P>
<P>ILLUSTRIOUS COUNCILLORS and SENATORS of Penn&s;ylvania!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His excellency the pre&s;ident, and &s;upreme executive council, and the members of the general a&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, attended the delivery of the oration, in the hall of the univer&s;ity, by invitation from the philo&s;ophical &s;ociety.</NOTE> I anticipate your candid reception of this feeble effort to encrea&s;e the
<PB N="40" REF="019972_0044_0FAD493542C3B3E0">
quantity of virtue in our republic. It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to remind you of the immen&s;e re&s;ources for greatne&s;s, which nature and Pro|vidence have be&s;towed upon our &s;tate. Every advantage which France has derived from being placed in the centre of Europe, and which Britain has derived from her mixture of nations, Penn&s;ylvania has opened to her. But my bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent, is to &s;ugge&s;t the means of promoting the happine&s;s, not the greatne&s;s of the &s;tate. For this purpo&s;e, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that our government, which unites into one all the minds of the &s;tate, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s, in an eminent degree, not only the under&s;tanding, the pa&s;&s;ions, and the will, but above all, the moral faculty, and the con&s;cience of an individual.&mdash;Nothing can be politically right, that is morally wrong; and no nece&s;&s;ity can ever &s;anctify a law, that is contrary to equity. VIRTUE is the living principle of a republic. To pro|mote this, laws for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice and immorality will be as ineffectual, as the encrea&s;e and enlargement of goals.&mdash;There is but one method of preventing crimes, and of rendering a republican form of government durable, and that is by di&s;&s;eminating the &s;eeds of virtue and knowledge through every part of the &s;tate, by means of proper modes and places of education, and this can be done effectually only, by the interference and aid of the legi&s;lature. I am &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the truth of this opinion, that were this evening to be the la&s;t of my life, I would not only &s;ay to the a&s;ylum of my ance&s;tors, and my beloved native country, with the patriot of Venice, "E&s;to perpetua,"&mdash;But I would add, as the la&s;t proof of my gratitude and affection for her, my parting advice to the guardians of her liberties, <Q>To e&s;tabli&s;h and &s;upport PUBLIC SCHOOLS in every part of the &s;tate.</Q></P>
