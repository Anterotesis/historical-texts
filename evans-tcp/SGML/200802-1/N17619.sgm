<P>A DISSERTATION ON THE MEANS OF PRESERVING HEALTH IN CHARLESTON, AND THE ADJACENT LOW COUNTRY.</P>
<P>THE object of the medical profe&s;&s;ion is not only to heal di&s;ea&s;es, but to prevent them. As it is my turn this evening to furni&s;h a &s;ubject of conver&s;ation for the &s;ociety, I &s;hall, with great de|ference, &s;ubmit to their con&s;ideration &s;ome practical ob&s;ervations on the means of preventing tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es which are mo&s;t common in Charle&s;ton and the vicinity. This I do the more readily as, having enjoyed almo&s;t uninterrupted health during a re&s;idence of &s;ixteen years in this climate, I hope that I may be allowed to have &s;ome experimental knowledge of the &s;ubject</P>
<P>The foundation of good health through life, &s;hould be laid in a proper treatment of infants. Their limbs &s;hould be unconfined, and frequently rubbed. Their food ought to be plain and &s;imple. They &s;hould be kept con&s;tantly clean, and never &s;uffered to remain wet for any length of time. Caps &s;hould be laid a&s;ide after the third or fourth month in winter, and much &s;ooner in &s;um|mer. Shoes and &s;tockings may well be di&s;pen&s;ed with through the whole period of infancy. Every prudent exertion &s;hould be early made for harden|ing the con&s;titution again&s;t &s;udden changes of the atmo&s;phere. To this end exerci&s;e &s;hould be freely and daily taken in the open air. When the weather turns &s;uddenly cold, &s;ome additional cloathing may be proper; but it is often more for the intere&s;t of children, to habituate them to all the varieties
<PB N="4" REF="022828_0003_0FBA6CCEA17C8E38">of our weather, and even to expo&s;e them to occa|&s;ional colds, than by an exce&s;s of care and tender|ne&s;s to induce a delicacy of habit.</P>
<P>In nur&s;ing cradles are hurtful. They add much to the heat of the infants who are confined between their narrow &s;ides. A hard matra&s;s is much cooler and on many accounts preferable. The youths who are accu&s;tomed to &s;leep on the floor with bare blankets, will pa&s;s through life with more independence and with greater advantanges than they who are accu&s;tomed to the relaxing indulgen|cies of &s;oft beds.</P>
<P>On the propriety of u&s;ing young children in this country to the cold bath, well informed phy&s;icians hold different opinions In &s;ome habits it certainly does good by bracing the tender limbs and fortifying the body again&s;t &s;udden changes of the air, while in others the &s;hock is too great. In general it may neverthele&s;s be &s;afely affirmed that a great majority of our children would have a better chance for e&s;caping the di&s;ea&s;es of infancy, if they were from an early period of life habituated to the frequent u&s;e of the cold bath; and that very few ca&s;es occur in which the daily wa&s;hing of them in cold water would not be of advantage.</P>
<P>Providence has kindly furni&s;hed us with an efficacious remedy for worms. Pink root is one of the be&s;t vermifuges in the world, and the &s;ea&s;onable admini&s;tration of it to our children, would &s;ave them from what often proves a &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;e and death.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="022828_0004_0FBA6CD0C31BBEF0">The months of April and May have been found by long experience to be unfriendly to children in Charle&s;ton. Parents &s;hould, there|fore, make arrangements for keeping them out of the city during the&s;e two months. Coun|try air is of &s;ingular utility not only for pre|venting but curing that vomiting and purging which attacks children on the approach of warm weather. Where a retreat to the country is not practicable, the next be&s;t preventive of this dan|gerous complaint is cold bathing.</P>
<P>The &s;tomachs and inte&s;tines of infants &s;hould be well clean&s;ed &s;oon after they are born. That mothers &s;hould re&s;t for &s;everal hours after their delivery is ad|vi&s;able. While they are recruited by repo&s;e after the &s;ufferings of parturition, their offspring may be pre|pared for &s;ucking with &s;afety. This can only be done by thoroughly emptying their &s;tomachs and inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion give me leave to ob&s;erve, that the writings of phy&s;icians who have practi&s;ed in colder climates are not applicable to this country. They repre&s;ent the fir&s;t milk of mothers as &s;ufficient to carry off the meconium of new born infants, but the contrary is known among us to every practitioner of phy&s;ic. Milk either has not the &s;ame qualities, or does not produce the &s;ame effects in warm as in cold countries. In this climate it not only often fails in carrying off from new-born infants tho&s;e crudities the retention of which gives ri&s;e to many di&s;ea&s;es, but in&s;tead thereof, by mingling with them, produces &s;uch di&s;turbances in the alimentary canal, as frequently i&s;&s;ue in imme|diate
<PB N="6" REF="022828_0005_0FBA6CD40BD046D8">death. Much of the mortality among chil|dren, e&s;pecially on plantations, is owing to this cau&s;e Overlaying, which is commonly &s;aid to be the occa&s;ion of their death, takes place much &s;eldomer than has been &s;uppo&s;ed. The locked jaw of infants frequently ari&s;es from the irritation excited by the mixture of milk with meconium. If there is any one direction of primary con&s;equence for pre&s;erving the health, and even the lives of infants, it is to empty their &s;tomachs and bowels well before they are &s;uffered to &s;uck plentifully. A due attention to this matter would annually &s;ave many lives.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ervation of health and prevention of di&s;ea&s;es among adults, much is to be avoided and much is to be done. In the former cla&s;s &s;everal particulars are to be reckoned. The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is lying long in bed in the morning.</P>
<P>The coole&s;t period of the day is a little before &s;un ri&s;ing. This naturally proves a temptation to &s;pend tho&s;e precious moments in &s;leep. If this is indulged, the body lies immer&s;ed in the air which has been fouled by its per&s;piration through the night, and in a &s;ituation which tends to relax it nearly as much as if it was in a vapor bath. By proper improvement of the morning, new life, vigor and &s;pirits are imparted for bearing the noon|tide heat; but by continuing to &s;leep, or even to loll, this opportunity of recruiting is lo&s;t&mdash;the languor and debility which re&s;ulted from the pre|ceding day continues to increa&s;e, till a change of &s;ea&s;on brings relief. The cool morning air acts like the cold bath in invigorating the body, and
<PB N="7" REF="022828_0006_0FBA6CD56BFBC018">has an advantage over it by being inhaled and applied to the vitals. In another view of this &s;ubject, it may be added, that a man who ri&s;es early will comparatively add &s;even years of the be&s;t time for &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s to a life of &s;ixty-five. Tho' early ri&s;ing is very whol&s;ome, yet going abroad in the morning in the country, while the gra&s;s is covered with dew, frequently produces fevers. To obtain the good, unmixed with the evil, the mo&s;t &s;hould be made of the cool morning air, but without wetting our feet with damp gra&s;s, or other|wi&s;e expo&s;ing our&s;elves to an undue ab&s;orption of that moi&s;ture which abounds for &s;ome time after the ri&s;ing of the &s;un. As a further precaution again&s;t the chills of the morning, it would be pru|dent never to go abroad with an empty &s;tomach. A gla&s;s of cold water, or &s;lice of bread, or a draught of &s;ome bitter tea, taken immediately after ri&s;ing, would be beneficial.</P>
<P>The above cautions of avoiding the morning dew may &s;afely be di&s;pen&s;ed with in many ca&s;es. A man who wa&s;hes his feet in cold water every day will hardly ever &s;uffer from walking abroad in the morning. Nor will he who changes his &s;hoes, and wipes his feet &s;oon after they are wet from dewy gra&s;s. It may farther be added, that if chil|dren were educated as they ought to be, when grown up they would have little to fear from wet feet or morning dews.</P>
<P>Immoderate drinking &s;hould be avoided in this climate. To add the &s;timulus of large quantities of &s;pirituous liquors to the heat occa&s;ioned by a warm atmo&s;phere, is to add fuel to fire. Every
<PB N="8" REF="022828_0007_0FBA6CD6E4D342E8">evil that naturally re&s;ults from an exce&s;s of heat, is aggravated by a plentiful u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits. The&s;e tend to inflame the blood, and concur with a warm &s;un in wearing out the vitals, ha&s;ten|ing on a premature old age and an untimely death. How far it would be for the benefit of our country to exterminate the u&s;e of di&s;tilled &s;pirits, I will not undertake to determine, but have no he&s;itation in pronouncing, that the &s;um of evil re&s;ulting from their abu&s;e infinitely outweighs all the good that flows from them.</P>
<P>The habit of immoderate drinking when once begun <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> on its unhappy votaries almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tibly. In the intervals of &s;obriety, they feel a faintne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion which is intolerably di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing. For this they find no relief but in a &s;econd intoxication. As the liquor lo&s;es its &s;ti|mulus, the do&s;e mu&s;t be increa&s;ed &s;o as to procure an abatement of painful &s;en&s;ations. The remedy proves wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e, and both continue to increa&s;e in a fatal progre&s;&s;ion from bad to wor&s;e, from ordinary grog to undiluted Jamaica &s;pirits: even the latter becomes in&s;ufficient to warm the &s;tomach, and in&s;tances &s;ometimes occur where the hotte&s;t peppers have been added to the warme&s;t &s;pirits to take off their fancied coldne&s;s. To enumerate all the di&s;ea&s;es which are brought on in this warm climate, by the abu&s;e of ardent &s;pirits, would far exceed the limits to which I mu&s;t confine my&s;elf. Suffice it to ob&s;erve, that among them is the de&s;truction of the dige&s;tive powers, ob&s;tructions of the abdominal vi&s;cera, drop&s;ies and madne&s;s. Nothing can more powerfully illu&s;trate the per|nicious
<PB N="9" REF="022828_0008_0FBA6CDBF47D2628">effects of rum than the havoc it makes among the Indians, who, from a robu&s;t and hardy race, by the free u&s;e of that pernicious liquid, be|come mad, wa&s;te away and die. They who wi&s;h to pre&s;erve health, &s;hould &s;ummon up all their re|&s;olution to prevent the blandi&s;hments of company, or the &s;eductions of appetite, from inducing them to deviate into the paths of intemperance; for, when once they have entered on that cour&s;e, their return to the practice of that moderation and &s;obriety which health requires, is always difficult and often impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Of the many forms in which ardent &s;pirits are taken to the prejudice of health, none is more in|jurious than drams. Under the in&s;idious &s;hew of fortifying the body again&s;t foggy and damp wea|ther, the practice of daily drinking drams has &s;lain its thou&s;ands. It gives a temporary &s;timulus to the &s;y&s;tem, but this is &s;oon followed with increa&s;ed debility. It creates a fal&s;e appetite, and tempts to the eating of more &s;olid food than either nature craves or the &s;tomach can dige&s;t. The&s;e are its fir&s;t effects. In proce&s;s of time con&s;equences of an oppo&s;ite nature are produced. A lo&s;s of appe|tite, at lea&s;t for breakfa&s;t, is a common complaint among tho&s;e who have long been in the habit of drinking drams. To the evils re&s;ulting from this &s;ource phy&s;icians have &s;ometimes incautiou&s;ly con|tributed by recommending the u&s;e of bitters. Though the bitters taken in &s;ub&s;tance, or in water, may be u&s;eful, the &s;pirits in which they are mo&s;tly prepared in&s;en&s;ibly lead to the practice of dram-drinking.
<PB N="10" REF="022828_0009_0FBA6CDD0F8B9958">Huxham's tincture of the bark is, on the&s;e principles, the occa&s;ion of much mi&s;chief. It would be for the intere&s;t of patients that phy&s;i|cians &s;hould never pre&s;cribe the internal u&s;e of any medicines prepared in &s;pirits, except &s;uch as are taken in &s;mall do&s;es. They pay too dearly for being cured of fevers or bad appetites, who, by taking &s;pirituous tinctures for that purpo&s;e, contract a fondne&s;s for drams. On this &s;ubject, it is worthy of remark, that health is often much injured by tho&s;e who are at all hours of the day &s;ipping &s;pi|rituous liquors, though they are never intoxicated. It is a good general rule never to drink any thing &s;tronger than water, except at our meals.</P>
<P>An intemperate use of animal food &s;hould be avoided in this climate, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer. Exce&s;s in eating is as bad as exce&s;s in drinking. It excites a greater oppre&s;&s;ion, and requires a greater exertion of the dige&s;tive organs. The warmer the weather, the greater is the tendency to putrefaction. It cannot be expected, that meat which becomes tainted in a few hours in market, can be much longer otherwi&s;e when it is taken immoderately into the &s;tomach. As often as an undue proportion of meat is taken at a meal, nature is not only oppre&s;&s;ed, but a foundation is laid for putrid di&s;ea&s;es. Perhaps in this view of the mat|ter, a &s;mall proportion of &s;alted meat, as being le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to putrefaction than fre&s;h, would be more &s;uitable aliment in &s;ummer than has ge|nerally been &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="022828_0010_0FBA6CDE7460BCB8">Inactivity is another of the evils again&s;t which the votaries of health &s;hould fix their mo&s;t deter|mined oppo&s;ition Many of our &s;ummer di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e from &s;uppre&s;&s;ed per&s;piration. From whatever cau&s;e this proceeds, languor and la&s;&s;itude are the immediate con&s;equences. The&s;e unplea&s;ant &s;en|&s;ations ought to be in&s;tantly removed; but to accompli&s;h that de&s;irable object, recour&s;e &s;hould immediately be had to &s;uch active exertions as are calculated to re&s;tore an equable and free per&s;pi|ration. Our feelings on the&s;e occa&s;ions deceive us. They per&s;uade us to indulge in re&s;t, but a regard to health leads to activity. The &s;en&s;e of wearine&s;s, which ari&s;es from &s;uppre&s;&s;ed per&s;pira|tion, is more ea&s;ily overcome by re&s;i&s;ting than yielding. The per&s;on who &s;its or lies down will find his la&s;&s;itude to continue and increa&s;e; but he, who in oppo&s;ition to his own feelings, makes a proper exertion of his active powers, will &s;oon be relieved from it.</P>
<P>The effects of exerci&s;e in promoting dige&s;tion, and all the regular functions of animal life, are too well known to need illu&s;tration. Suffice it to ob|&s;erve, by way of applying the general ob&s;ervation to our local &s;ituation, that from the great moi&s;ture of our atmo&s;phere, impediments to a free per&s;pi|ration frequently occur. The&s;e &s;hould be coun|teracted by &s;uch con&s;tant, equable activity as, without heating the body, will keep all the &s;e|cretions in their due order and proportion.</P>
<P>Among the evils re&s;ulting from indolence, a &s;ondne&s;s for drinking ardent &s;pirits is not the
<PB N="12" REF="022828_0011_0FBA6CDFE50E5BD0">lea&s;t. Human nature is &s;o con&s;tituted that it requires &s;omething to agitate it. Where the mind and body are both unemployed, the &s;timulus of &s;trong liquor becomes de&s;irable, as a means of exciting &s;en&s;ations, and of obviating the irk&s;ome|ne&s;s of having nothing to do.</P>
<P>Inactivity is thus doubly de&s;tructive to health. Fir&s;t, by its own primary effects; and, &s;econdly, by leading to intemperance.</P>
<P>Long &s;ittings at meals &s;hould be avoided in this climate. All the evils re&s;ulting from the &s;ources which have been already mentioned, are increa&s;ed by the fa&s;hionable cu&s;tom of &s;pending three or four hours at the dinner table, for it leads to them all. The u&s;e of &s;egars has the &s;ame ten|dency. They occa&s;ion a wa&s;te of the &s;aliva, and of cour&s;e injure the dige&s;tion of our food. They produce artificial thir&s;t, and con&s;equently lead to tipling. By taking off that &s;en&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s which re&s;ults from having nothing to do, they de|&s;troy one of the mo&s;t powerful incentives to action, and lead to habits of indolence. The &s;moke of the &s;egars tends to correct the moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere, and the u&s;e of them in &s;ome con&s;ti|tutions may advantageou&s;ly evacuate redundant phlegm; but the &s;mall advantages procured in this way are outweighed by many greater evils which flow fom their daily u&s;e.</P>
<P>Sudden changes from hot to cold air, violent exertions, depre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions, hard rides, long walks, great fatigue, and exce&s;&s;es of all kinds, &s;hould be guarded again&s;t by tho&s;e who are
<PB N="13" REF="022828_0012_0FBA6CE585C01778">anxious for the pre&s;ervation of health. The&s;e cautions are particularly nece&s;&s;ary in the interval between June and October; for, during that time, there is &s;uch a morbid irritability of the whole &s;y&s;tem, that irregularities, which in other months of the year might be harmle&s;s, &s;eldom fail of im|mediately drawing after them &s;erious con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Hunting clubs &s;hould be wholly di&s;continued through the &s;ummer. They begin with violent exerci&s;e, and this is followed by plentiful eating and drinking. After exce&s;&s;ive per&s;piration has been excited by the&s;e means, a ride late in the even|ing clo&s;es the &s;cene. Few &s;ituations occur in which there is &s;o dangerous a combination of the cau&s;es of our fevers as takes place on the&s;e occa|&s;ions. For &s;imilar rea&s;ons the game of fives, cricket, and in &s;hort every &s;pecies of diver&s;ion or exerci&s;e that requires violent exertions &s;hould be abandoned in warm weather.</P>
<P>The time of expo&s;ure to the &s;un &s;hould be &s;hortened as much as po&s;&s;ible. While we are ne|ce&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed to it, we &s;hould ab&s;tain from ardent &s;pirits, and &s;hould avoid &s;tanding &s;till. It would al&s;o be proper to protect our heads from the effects of heat, by wearing white hats. The&s;e will be much the better for deep crowns of &s;uch a con|&s;truction as leaves a vacancy between the head and the hat. Fa&s;hion, which &s;eldoms con&s;ults either health or convenience, has lately deviated into what is &s;alutary by introducing the u&s;e of flapped hats on the above con&s;truction. Long may this
<PB N="14" REF="022828_0013_0FBA6CE6AABACFF0">fa&s;hion continue, or rather may it never cea&s;e to be the fa&s;hion in Carolina.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be careful of lying in damp rooms, or in linen not &s;ufficiently dry; and we &s;hould always put on dry cloaths, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, after being wet. Chilling ea&s;terly winds, night air, and the evening dews &s;hould be avoided. The latter are more pernicious than a thorough wetting from rain. Dew in this climate is of &s;uch a pene|trating nature, that no ordinary covering can be depended on for excluding it. It in&s;inuates it&s;elf through our cloaths, and coming in contact with the &s;kin, checks tho&s;e di&s;charges which health requires. They who indulge them&s;elves in &s;pend|ing their evenings in open balconies, often pay dear for the hazardous gratification. The ground on which Charle&s;ton &s;tands was probably gained from the ocean, and is but a little higher than the ordi|nary level of the &s;ea. By digging eight or ten feet, we every where find water. From this cir|cum&s;tance, together with the lowne&s;s of the ground, and the abundance of &s;wamps and mar&s;hes, we breathe an air abounding with moi&s;ture. The heat of the &s;un &s;o commonly but unju&s;tly com|plained of, is beneficial by correcting this moi&s;ture; but when his chearful influence is withdrawn, the natural dampne&s;s of the air becomes eminently pernicious. Sleeping with open windows is, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, very injurious, e&s;pecially if great changes of the atmo&s;phere take place in the time of &s;leep. Habit has &s;o far inured &s;everal per&s;ons to this practice, that they &s;uffer nothing from it.
<PB N="15" REF="022828_0014_0FBA6CE825DCCB78">It mu&s;t al&s;o be acknowledged, that the confined air of a &s;mall clo&s;e room &s;oon becomes unfit for re&s;piration. In e&s;timating matters of this kind, the advantages and di&s;advantages &s;hould be weighed again&s;t each other. An opinion formed in this way would, as a general rule, be in favor of &s;leeping with &s;hut windows, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are near our beds. Perhaps the plan mo&s;t con&s;i&s;t|ent with health and comfort would be, to &s;leep in a room altogether clo&s;e, except a door which opened into an adjoining one, into which there was a free admi&s;&s;ion of the external air. In every ca&s;e we &s;hould &s;o arrange our&s;elves as to be &s;ecure, that wind may not blow directly on us when we are at re&s;t, and e&s;pecially when we are compo&s;ed for &s;leep. The body of a man a&s;leep is in it&s;elf con&s;iderably cooler than when he is awake. There is, therefore, great danger from that unde&s;igned &s;leep which often &s;teals upon us in con&s;equence of tho&s;e lollings in which, when the weather is hot, we are prone to indulge our&s;elves. They who wi&s;h to pre&s;erve health &s;hould re&s;i&s;t all temptations to &s;leep, except in circum&s;tances where proper precautions are taken for defending the body from that abatement of animal heat which re&s;ults from &s;leep it&s;elf, and &s;till more from changes of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t care &s;hould be taken for the pre&s;ervation of cleanline&s;s in our per&s;ons, hou&s;es, kitchens, yards, &s;tables, pumps and &s;treets. The drains &s;hould be kept con&s;tantly free from ob&s;truc|tions; but if this cannot be done, the grates over
<PB N="16" REF="022828_0015_0FBA6CE9A6FA93A0">them &s;hould be covered to keep down the effluvia that would otherwi&s;e i&s;&s;ue from them to the great danger of the inhabitants. The low grounds of this city, in which water u&s;ually &s;tagnates, &s;hould be filled up<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This might be done to a con&s;iderable extent, with little trouble or expence. If hou&s;ekeepers would charge them&s;elves with filling up the ponds before their own doors and in their own yards, a &s;aving would &s;oon be made in their Doctors bills which would amply reimbur&s;e them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All offen&s;ive and putrifying &s;ub&s;tances &s;hould be burnt up, or at lea&s;t removed, &s;o as to prevent their poi&s;oning the air we breathe. The number of dead animals, and the quantity of putrid vege|tables in our &s;treets, is a nui&s;ance of the mo&s;t dangerous kind. The expence of keeping the city clean would be much le&s;s than what is ex|pended in curing the di&s;ea&s;es that are fo&s;tered by the filth of our &s;treets. The weeds which &s;urround the planters hou&s;es in the country &s;hould, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, be burned in that &s;ea&s;on of the year when they begin to rot.</P>
<P>Co&s;tivene&s;s ought to be particularly avoided in this climate. Regularity in the alvine di&s;charges is of the la&s;t con&s;equence. Their retention, by di&s;turbing the whole animal oeconomy, proves a &s;ource of many evils. Whenever the&s;e di&s;charges do not return at their proper period, efficacious methods &s;hould be immediately adopted to aid the languid bowels in the di&s;charge of their nece&s;&s;ary functions. Ri&s;ing early is one of the be&s;t means of obviating co&s;tivene&s;s. The cool morning air
<PB N="17" REF="022828_0016_0FBA6CEEBA6157D0">tends to throw the excrementitious humors on the bowels, and to ha&s;ten their di&s;charge. The re|ver&s;e is the ca&s;e with &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;pend an undue proportion of their time in a recumbent po&s;ture, and particularly tho&s;e who lie in bed after &s;unri&s;e. Attention to the &s;tate of the bowels is particularly indi&s;pen&s;ible in the &s;ummer and fir&s;t months of the autumn. In mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es between June and November, the bile is more or le&s;s injuriou&s;ly predominant, and &s;hould be daily di&s;charged. In the beforementioned period every article of meat or drink, known by experience to generate a &s;urplu&s;age of bile, &s;hould be either wholly laid a&s;ide, or &s;paringly u&s;ed; and co&s;tivene&s;s &s;hould be obviated by the u&s;e of laxative food. Perhaps no &s;imple in the power of every per&s;on is more efficacious, in preventing bilious complaints, than raw eggs beat up into an agreeable mixture and taken every morning.</P>
<P>If notwith&s;tanding all our precautions to the contrary, a fever is beginning to form, in&s;tead of indulging the vain hope, that it will go off it&s;elf, we &s;hould in&s;tantly retreat to our chambers, and take &s;omething, that by re&s;toring an equable per|&s;piration will turn the current of humors from within outwardly. Nothing does this &s;o effectually as a vomit. A proper medicine of that kind taken in time, when the introductory &s;ymptoms forebode a fever, will often de&s;troy it in embryo, prevent a fit of &s;ickne&s;s, and the nece&s;&s;ity of taking a variety of other medicines.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="022828_0017_0FBA6CF00A5B0428">In enumerating what ought to be done to pre|&s;erve health, the advantages of temperance and exerci&s;e are obvious; but in&s;tead of dilating on principles &s;uited to every &s;ituation, it will be more proper to dwell on &s;uch as e&s;pecially apply to our own. For eight months of the year, South-Caro|lina is as healthy as any part of the globe. Our winters are delightful, and our greate&s;t &s;ummer heats are far from being intolerably di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. The mercury in the thermometer ri&s;es every year as high in Bo&s;ton, New-York and Philadelphia, as in Charle&s;ton. I have lived in both of the latter cities, and can with truth declare, that I have &s;uf|fered more from heat, in each of them, than I ever did in Charle&s;ton. If our &s;ummers are longer, and render us le&s;s able to bear continued fatigue, this is amply compen&s;ated by the &s;uperior mildne&s;s of our winters and the &s;uperior fertility of our &s;oil, which requires le&s;s labor for procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The inhabitants of this &s;tate are in general, at all times, le&s;s liable to rheumati&s;ms, coughs, colds, and in|flammatory di&s;orders, than tho&s;e who live in colder climates. Con&s;umptions, except a few from ca|tarrh, are &s;eldom &s;een among&s;t our own citizens. Gravel and &s;tone are comparatively rare in this country. But to fevers of the low kind, we are particularly expo&s;ed, e&s;pecially in the interval between June and November. As the&s;e may be con&s;idered to be the endemic of the country, I beg leave to offer &s;ome practical ob&s;ervations on the means of preventing them. Our &s;ummer and autumnal fevers, as far as they depend on local
<PB N="19" REF="022828_0018_0FBA6CF1387BABC8">&s;ituation, chiefly ari&s;e from the &s;eparate or combined influence of heat, moi&s;ture, and mar&s;h mia&s;mata. To &s;ecure the body again&s;t the effects of the&s;e enemies to health, is, or ought to be, an object of general attention. With this view, I would re|commend the wearing of flannel next the &s;kin. It has already been ob&s;erved, that in &s;ummer per|&s;piration is great. Perhaps it is fortunate for us that it is &s;o, for as many of our humors are by heat rendered morbid, the &s;ea&s;onable di&s;charge of them is highly beneficial. Where a per&s;on is immedi|ately covered with linen, the per&s;pirable matter, as fa&s;t as thrown off, is collected and kept in contact with the ducts from which it exuded. On the other hand, flannel, by ab&s;orbing the &s;ame, removes much of it from the &s;kin. As the di&s;charge of this excrementitious matter is beneficial, the reten|tion of it mu&s;t be injurious. The gentle friction of flannel, which &s;oon cea&s;es to be di&s;agreeable, acts like a fle&s;h bru&s;h, and promotes an agreeable regular per&s;piration, than which nothing is more conducive to health. Where the trunk of the body is immediately covered with woollen of any kind, the chance of &s;uffering from &s;udden changes of the atmo&s;phere is greatly le&s;&s;ened. Summer colds are infinitely more dangerous than tho&s;e which take place in winter. To the&s;e we are particularly ex|po&s;ed in the latter end of the warm weather, when the nights begin to grow cool. They who con&s;ult only pre&s;ent gratification, are apt to di&s;encumber them&s;elves from the bed cloaths, and in that &s;itu|ation they go to &s;leep. This, though harmle&s;s in
<PB N="20" REF="022828_0019_0FBA6CF2A4686770">the fir&s;t part of the night, often becomes injurious before day, either from &s;udden changes of the at|mo&s;phere, or from that gradual cooling of it which takes place towards autumn. He who &s;leeps in flannel has a con&s;tant defence again&s;t tho&s;e changes, and is thereby fortified again&s;t a common exciting cau&s;e of the di&s;orders of the &s;ea&s;on. Such as can|not reconcile them&s;elves to the wearing of flannel con&s;tantly, &s;hould at lea&s;t put it on when they are particularly expo&s;ed. The inhabitants of Charle&s;|ton going to the country when fevers are ri&s;e, would do well to ob&s;erve this precaution, while they are out of the city, e&s;pecially if their bu&s;ine&s;s leads them to be much in rice fields, or in the vicinity of &s;tagnant waters.</P>
<P>Cold bathing, under proper regulations, is an excellent preventive of the di&s;ea&s;es of this country. As heat relaxes, it is obvious that cold mu&s;t brace. Once in twenty-four hours, to immer&s;e the body in cold water, mo&s;t powerfully &s;trengthens the whole &s;y&s;tem. Per&s;piration, though for a mo|ment checked, increa&s;es with the returning glow, which immediately follows when the bathed per&s;on is wiped dry and begins to take exerci&s;e. If this is done in the evening, it &s;eldom fails of procuring a good night's re&s;t: if in the morning, it fortifies the body for bearing the heat of the following day. By bracing the whole &s;y&s;tem, it de&s;troys that pre|di&s;po&s;ition to di&s;ea&s;es, which is brought on by the relaxing qualities of heat and moi&s;ture. It is farther &s;erviceable by keeping the &s;kin con&s;tantly clean. Such is the exce&s;&s;ive per&s;piration in this
<PB N="21" REF="022828_0020_0FBA6CF7D65BB1A0">country, in the &s;ummer, that frequent wa&s;hings are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve cleanline&s;s. This precaution is too often neglected where peri|odical bathings are di&s;u&s;ed. The advantages from even a partial u&s;e of the cold bath are great. Colds in the head are very uncommon when it is daily wa&s;hed in cold water. The eyes of a per&s;on who frequently plunges them, wide open, into cold water, will &s;eldom be either weak or inflamed. Di&s;ea&s;es of the throat rarely attack tho&s;e who daily wa&s;h their necks with cold water. Frequent wa&s;hings of the mouth prevent much of the tooth|ache. It has already been ob&s;erved, that the per&s;on who daily wa&s;hes his feet in cold water, will hardly ever &s;uffer from expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the dews of the morning. So many di&s;ea&s;es might be pre|vented, and &s;o much good might be done by a judicious u&s;e of bathing, that every gentleman ought to have an apparatus in his hou&s;e for that purpo&s;e. Sometimes cold water, and &s;ometimes tepid, ought to be u&s;ed. In other ca&s;es wa&s;hing would be preferable to bathing. To adju&s;t the&s;e, and &s;everal other particulars, and to prevent the mi&s;chiefs that might ari&s;e from indi&s;creet bathing, the advice of a phy&s;ician is often nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The aliment u&s;ed in &s;ummer &s;hould be anti|&s;eptic and generous. The influence of what we eat and drink is very great. Butter and fat meats tend evidently to clog the &s;tomach and vitiate the bile, and therefore &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, or &s;paringly u&s;ed in hot weather. A due proportion of meat and vegetables is proper. Pepper, and the other
<PB N="22" REF="022828_0021_0FBA6CF8E45B6F20">warm condiments, which are u&s;ed in &s;ea&s;oning, though in theory they &s;eem to be improper, in a country where heat abounds, are found by expe|rience to be whole&s;ome. They are for the mo&s;t part the productions of warm climates, and we find that the productions of all countries &s;uit be&s;t with their inhabitants. As no di&s;h is more com|mon among negroes than pepperpot, &s;o none is more whole&s;ome. Dr. Lind ob&s;erves, that "the negroes in the torrid zone commonly mix the mo&s;t &s;timulating, poignant &s;auces with their ordi|nary light food, and this is experimentally found &s;uitable to their con&s;titutions." In u&s;ing fruit the following cautions &s;hould be ob&s;erved. It &s;hould be thoroughly ripe, and taken only in moderation, and baked or &s;tewed rather than raw. A total ab&s;tinence, for &s;ome time after recovering from fevers, would be be&s;t for convale&s;cents. Watermelons are not only innocent but u&s;eful. They may &s;afely be taken in many fevers, and under qualified circum&s;tances, tend to prevent the di&s;ea&s;es u&s;ually prevalent when they are in &s;ea&s;on. Water is Nature's diluent. It is the only drink that can be &s;afely taken at all times and by all per&s;ons; but, neverthele&s;s, men in every age and country, and in every &s;tate of &s;ociety, have &s;ought for &s;omething that was more &s;timulant. Of all the additions made to water for that purpo&s;e, rum is the mo&s;t pernicious. It contains no nouri&s;h|ment, but like a &s;low poi&s;on in&s;en&s;ibly undermines the &s;prings of life. As mankind will not content them&s;elves with nature's beverage, it is the duty
<PB N="23" REF="022828_0022_0FBA6CFA2C044B98">of phy&s;icians to direct them to &s;uch &s;ubtitutes as bring the greate&s;t benefits with the lea&s;t injury. Of this cla&s;s are liquors which are prepared by fermentation, and al&s;o tho&s;e which are expre&s;&s;ed from vegetables. Of the drinks u&s;ed among us, none are equal to porter and wine for preventing fevers. The former, by its bitterne&s;s, &s;trengthens the &s;tomach, while it proves highly nutritious, and at the &s;ame time moderately evacuant. Ob&s;tinate vomitings are &s;ometimes cured by it, more effectu|ally than by the mo&s;t celebrated officinal compo|&s;itions. Within ten years pa&s;t, in which the inha|bitants of this city have generally exchanged punch for porter, they have grown much more healthy. Complaints of the bowels have &s;en&s;ibly le&s;&s;ened. Phy&s;icians are not now called upon to attend one patient with the dry belly-ache for every ten they formerly vi&s;ited. Punch, when weak and taken in moderation, and no oftener than occa&s;ionally, is &s;alutary and refre&s;hing, but by no means &s;uits for common drink. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds good with re&s;pect to cyder. Mineral acids, diluted with water, correct bile, and re&s;i&s;t our &s;ummer di&s;ea&s;es; but this cannot be affirmed of drinks prepared with limes and &s;uch like vegetable acids when freely and frequently taken. The&s;e re|marks, though generally well founded, admit of exceptions.</P>
<P>The temperate u&s;e of good &s;ound wine is one of the mo&s;t effectual, as well as one of the plea&s;ante&s;t, antidotes to fevers. It is highly anti&s;eptic, and both prevents and cures putrid di&s;ea&s;es. It is
<PB N="24" REF="022828_0023_0FBA6CFBA5143000">much more worthy of the appellation of a cordial, than any of the boa&s;ted officinal compo&s;itions, which are called by that name. Different con&s;ti|tutions require different wines, but in general old Madeira agrees be&s;t with the inhabitants of Caro|lina. All phy&s;icians know, that in low fevers a liberal u&s;e of wine is an e&s;&s;ential part of the cure. In order to get the full benefit of this mo&s;t de&s;i|rable preventive of our &s;ummer di&s;ea&s;es, it &s;hould not be drank every day. If it was laid a&s;ide in the winter and &s;pring, and re&s;umed on the approach of &s;ummer, and continued in daily u&s;e, only for three or four months, its efficacy in preventing &s;ummer and autumnal di&s;ea&s;es would be greatly increa&s;ed. The per&s;on who, with the above limi|tations, drinks from half a pint to a pint of wine every twenty-four hours cannot, in this climate, be ju&s;tly deemed intemperate.</P>
<P>The daily u&s;e of &s;trong warm teas is pernicious. Many re&s;pectable medical authorities might be produced, which concur in repre&s;enting Ea&s;t-India tea as unfriendly to the nerves. Be this as it may, all mu&s;t acknowledge, that the warm water, which is u&s;ed as its vehicle, mu&s;t be un&s;uitable to this climate.</P>
<P>Cheerfulne&s;s is of particular &s;ervice in pre&s;erving health. Many of our di&s;ea&s;es flow from bile, and fretfulne&s;s never fails to cau&s;e an increa&s;ed flux of that acrid humor into the &s;tomach. Tho&s;e who watch their own feelings may ob&s;erve, that when any wayward event breaks in on the peace of their minds, a bitter ta&s;te is immediately felt. This
<PB N="25" REF="022828_0024_0FBA6D00D088C9C0">proceeds from an overflowing of bile. Bilious per&s;ons are for the mo&s;t part peevi&s;h, and peevi&s;h per&s;ons are for the mo&s;t part bilious. Bile and fretfulne&s;s &s;eem to be reciprocally cau&s;e and effect, and both predi&s;po&s;e to dangerous di&s;orders. The eyes are &s;ometimes ob&s;erved to turn &s;uddenly yel|low, in a gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion. They who are ble&s;&s;ed with a con&s;tant, equable flow of cheerful &s;pirits, are exempted from one of the occa&s;ional cau&s;es of fevers: On the other hand, &s;uch as give way to peevi&s;hne&s;s, or to the depre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions, are par|ticularly expo&s;ed to the di&s;ea&s;es, which a low, moi&s;t country is apt to produce.</P>
<P>In particular habits, the daily u&s;e of je&s;uit's bark, from July till October, is advi&s;eable. Three do&s;es of it, combined with a little rhubarb if nece&s;&s;ary, taken in &s;ub&s;tance, every day or every other day, where ordinary precautions are taken, may in ge|neral be relied upon as an effectual antidote to the &s;ummer and autumnal fevers of this country.</P>
<P>Throughout the &s;ummer and the fir&s;t month of the autumn, fires are more u&s;eful in damp days, than in the dry cold weather of winter. They correct the exce&s;&s;ive moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere, and counteract the exciting cau&s;es of the complaints mo&s;t u&s;ual in the before mentioned &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>In the con&s;truction of our hou&s;es, we &s;acrifice health to profit and convenience, by digging cellars underneath them. The walls at their &s;ides, and covers to their bottoms, le&s;&s;en the evils that might otherwi&s;e re&s;ult from them, but it would be better if there was not a cellar in the city. The
<PB N="26" REF="022828_0025_0FBA6D01D45AFFA0">evils ari&s;ing from this &s;ource are of &s;uch a magni|tude, as to need the interpo&s;ition of the city coun|cil. A law to compel all the inhabitants to pump the water out of their cellars, as &s;oon as it begins to &s;tagnate, would be &s;alutary. It mu&s;t have frequently occurred to every attentive ob&s;erver, that, in wet &s;ea&s;ons, the cellars in the low part of this city emit &s;uch putrid exhalations, as are &s;en&s;ibly offen&s;ive even to pa&s;&s;engers. They who live over &s;uch cellars, or in the vicinity of them, mu&s;t, therefore, be particularly expo&s;ed to di&s;ea&s;es, and when &s;ick, are with difficulty cured, unle&s;s they remove to a purer atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The practice of planting trees before the doors of dwelling hou&s;es, is recommended by &s;ound medical rea&s;oning It has been demon&s;trated, that trees ab&s;orb unhealthy air, and di&s;charge it in a highly purified &s;tate, in the form of what modern chymi&s;ts call dephlogi&s;ticated air. It is only to be lamented, that the cu&s;tom is not univer&s;al, and that &s;ome uniformity is not ob&s;erved in the di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e beneficial ornaments. Should the pre&s;ent city council make effectual arrangements for plant|ing magnolias, or &s;uch like trees, every twelve or fifteen feet, on each &s;ide of our &s;treets, through their whole length, they would merit the thanks of the ri&s;ing generation.</P>
<P>Whether paving the &s;treets of Charle&s;ton would conduce to the health of the inhabitants, has been doubted by many. It might add to the heat of the air, but would le&s;&s;en its morbid qualities, by repre&s;&s;ing exhalations. As dry heat alone is a
<PB N="27" REF="022828_0026_0FBA6D032BC28F78">much le&s;s evil than heat, moi&s;ture and mia&s;mata combined, it is probable, that the inhabitants would be gainers, on balancing the advantages again&s;t the di&s;advantages that would re&s;ult from paving the &s;treets of this city.</P>
<P>In con&s;tructing our city hou&s;es, we &s;hould en|deavor to make them, e&s;pecially on their north, &s;outh and we&s;t &s;ides, as open as po&s;&s;ible to favor the circulation of fre&s;h air. A man in health pol|lutes a gallon of air in a minute, to &s;uch a degree, as to render it unfit for the purpo&s;es of life. The danger of breathing confined, unventilated air, mu&s;t be therefore &s;elf-evident. On the&s;e principles, the u&s;e of curtains, other than tho&s;e for excluding mu&s;quitoes, may be advantageou&s;ly di&s;pen&s;ed with. They &s;eldom or never do any good, and by con|fining and heating the air often do harm.</P>
<P>The late practice of adding an attic &s;tory to low hou&s;es, is not only ornamental but beneficial. It increa&s;es the chances for health The higher we a&s;cend into the atmo&s;phere, the cooler it is, and the farther are we removed from tho&s;e poi&s;onous exha|lations which, though they ri&s;e from the earth and &s;tagnant waters, &s;eldom or never a&s;cend to any con&s;iderable height. It is on the&s;e accounts pru|dent to &s;leep in the highe&s;t apartments of our hou&s;es, unle&s;s where their low pitch and converging &s;ides make them warmer than tho&s;e which are on the lower floors.</P>
<P>Wooden hou&s;es are mo&s;t &s;uitable to this cli|mate. They are much drier, and con&s;equently healthier, than tho&s;e which are built with brick.
<PB N="28" REF="022828_0027_0FBA6D04A4796318">The latter ab&s;orb and retain, for a long time, much of that moi&s;ture with which our atmo&s;phere abounds. The &s;peedy rotting of paper on back walls proves their dampne&s;s. This is particularly the ca&s;e, when &s;ome of their &s;ides are inacce&s;&s;ible to the &s;un. In &s;uch &s;ituations they are &s;eldom, for any con&s;iderable length of time, thoroughly dry. On this account, &s;uch of the inhabitants of this city as are troubled with rheumatic pains, coughs and complaints of the brea&s;t, &s;hould not live on that part of the Bay which is between its &s;outhern extremity and Broad &s;treet. The hou&s;es there are mo&s;tly built with brick, and are &s;o clo&s;ely con|nected together, that two, and often three of their &s;ides are, for the greate&s;t part of the day, &s;heltered from the direct rays of the &s;un Moi&s;ture there predominates, and, in conjunction with ea&s;terly winds, is very unfavorable to children and &s;uch as have weak lungs. Brick hou&s;es would be much drier than they u&s;ually are, if a vacancy was left between the walls and the pla&s;tering on their in|&s;ides. This might ea&s;ily be done by means of &s;tuds projecting but a few inches from the walls.</P>
<P>The po&s;ition of our country hou&s;es, with re&s;pect to &s;wamps, ought to be attended to; for the &s;um|mer winds, &s;weeping along their &s;urface, waft de&s;truction to the inhabitants. In general, the planters would do well to encourage the growing of trees, between their hou&s;es and the neighboring &s;wamps; and to con&s;truct their hou&s;es &s;o as to have neither-doors nor windows fronting on mar&s;hy ground; but as this cannot always be done, they
<PB N="29" REF="022828_0028_0FBA6D09D363A368">&s;hould build on the &s;outh &s;ides of their rice fields and other waters. The winds in the &s;ummer months are for the mo&s;t part &s;outherly. To be under a nece&s;&s;ity of breathing air, &s;aturated with the noxious effluvia acquired in pa&s;&s;ing over &s;tag|nant waters, mu&s;t be highly injurious. Indeed if health was, as it ought to be, preferred to riches, the planters would build their dwelling hou&s;es at a di&s;tance from the rivers. The inhabitants of a hou&s;e in the pine barren has a much better chance for health, than he who&s;e man&s;ion is erected in the neighbourhood of any body of water, either &s;tag|nant or running. Health and wealth &s;eem to be at variance. The &s;ame qualities of the &s;oil which make it fruitful, make it al&s;o unwhol&s;ome, while the dry &s;urface of pine barren pre&s;ents compara|tively a pure and whol&s;ome air. Be&s;ides, the re&s;in of the pine trees in it&s;elf contributes to the &s;alubrity of the atmo&s;phere. It is an old and well authen|ticated ob&s;ervation, that per&s;ons whether white or black, employed in burning tar-kilns, are always healthy. The method practi&s;ed by Indians and negroes of living in &s;moke, is conducive to health; but the inconvenience of &s;uch a &s;ituation will for|ever operate again&s;t its being introduced into common u&s;e among our citizens; but, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome con&s;iderable analogous benefit, with little expence or inconvenience, might be procured to tho&s;e who re&s;ide in the country, from fires kindled round or near their hou&s;es. The&s;e will be more nece&s;&s;ary when the wind is ea&s;terly, and more beneficial if made with re&s;inous pine-wood.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="022828_0029_0FBA6D0AD500FBD0">On the&s;e principles, there is no difficulty in ac|counting why Charle&s;ton is more healthy than the neighboring pari&s;hes. It has long been ob&s;erved in low countries, that they who re&s;ide in towns, are more healthy than tho&s;e who live di&s;per&s;ed in the country, and that the inhabitants of the central parts of towns are healthier than tho&s;e who live in their extremities. The fire and &s;moke from &s;everal hundred contiguous kitchens cannot fail of dimi|ni&s;hing the moi&s;tne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere. The frequent ringing of bells, the flowing of the tides, the motion of carriages and of per&s;ons, occa&s;ions a bri&s;ker circulation of air in this city, than in the adjacent country. The policy of removing, on the approach of &s;ummer, from the country to Charle&s;ton, is therefore wi&s;e. The proper time for making this change varies in different years. In general it may be ob&s;erved, that it &s;hould be early, if a wet &s;pring is followed by a dry &s;ummer. While &s;ucce&s;&s;ive rains keep the waters in motion, the danger is little; but when warm and dry wea|ther continues for &s;ome time after heavy rains have fallen, fevers will probably &s;oon begin to rage.</P>
<P>Strangers who propo&s;e to re&s;ide in this country, and our own citizens who have been long ab&s;ent, when intending to return, &s;hould make a point of arriving here about the month of November. They would then have at lea&s;t half a year to be a&s;&s;imi|lated to the climate, before their health would be endangered by any thing peculiar to it. The &s;udden deaths among us of per&s;ons di&s;u&s;ed to our country, are to be referred to an injudicious choice
<PB N="31" REF="022828_0030_0FBA6D0C2CEEA7B0">of time for coming to it, and &s;till more to their own imprudence, combined with the ho&s;pitality of the inhabitants. To be invited almo&s;t daily to the plentiful tables of their friends and acquaint|ances, is the misfortune of &s;uch per&s;ons A fever, rapid in its progre&s;s, and fatal in its i&s;&s;ue, is fre|quently the con&s;equence. Strangers coming into this country &s;hould be doubly on their guard, but in&s;tead thereof they too often &s;uffer them&s;elves to be fea&s;ted into fevers, and not unfrequently out of their lives.</P>
<P>On a review of the whole &s;ubject, it may be ob&s;erved, that in&s;tead of &s;aying, "this capital is more &s;ickly than the other maritime towns of the United States," it ought only to be &s;aid, "that more care is nece&s;&s;ary on the part of its inhabitants for the pre&s;ervation of their health." By proper attention to our children, and e&s;pe|cially by &s;teady, di&s;creet management of mo|thers, much of the mortality of infants might be prevented, and a new generation be reared, which would be much hardier and better adapted to the climate than many of the pre&s;ent. In fami|lies where children have been properly brought up, many of both &s;exes have as good con&s;titutions as are enjoyed by tho&s;e who live in more northern latitudes. The honors of old age are often attained by our citizens. Indeed the chance of life to a per&s;on who is above &s;ixty years old, is con&s;iderably in favor of the inhabitants of warm countries. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the variablenene&s;s and &s;udden changes of our atmo&s;phere make caution
<PB N="32" REF="022828_0031_0FBA6D0DCBF18690">indi&s;pen&s;able; but this as enforcing the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;ober, orderly life, ought to be e&s;teemed an advantage. None of the ble&s;&s;ings of this world can be attained without care. It is, therefore, unrea&s;onable to look for health on ea&s;ier terms. Much attention is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve, even a good e&s;tate, from running to wa&s;te. The &s;ame is requi&s;ite for guarding a &s;ound con&s;titution again&s;t di&s;ea&s;es. As well may the planter, who rarely vi&s;its his plantation, expect a good crop, as the man who lives at random, look for the continued en|joyment of health Such as are for a &s;hort life and a merry one, mu&s;t abide by the con&s;equences of their choice. But they who conduct with prudence, and have &s;elf-denial to ab&s;tain from &s;uch practices as experience may have proved to be hurtful, and &s;teadine&s;s to follow what by the &s;ame unerring rule they have found to be &s;alutary, may live as health|ily, and as long in this city, as in any part of the world.</P>
