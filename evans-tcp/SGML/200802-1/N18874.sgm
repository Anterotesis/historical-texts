<P><HI>THE Author is inclined to think, that the tru|ly affecting</HI> occa&s;ion <HI>on which the following di&s;|cour&s;e was delivered, and the tender feelings of the bearers thereby excited, more than any peculiar ex|cellence in the Sermon, cau&s;ed them to reque&s;t its publication: But a hope, that the great, the plain and important truths it contains, may be the means of doing good, together with a di&s;po&s;ition to oblige them, prevails with him to comply with it.&mdash;The addre&s;s at the clo&s;e, in particular, he is &s;en&s;ible may expo&s;e him to the cen&s;ure of the critic; but it claims the candor of the public, as it was nece&s;&s;a|rily &s;poken without much premeditation or penning of the &s;entiments, the preacher expecting to &s;peak to the pri&s;oner under a &s;entence of death,(it being the de&s;ign of the meeting) 'till the news of the pardon arrived about half an hour before the meet|ing: For the &s;ame rea&s;on the reader is de&s;ired to excu&s;e it, if it is not exactly recollected as it was &s;poken: The &s;ub&s;tance, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, is here giv|en to the public.</HI></P>
<P>&rindx;<HI>So &s;ingular an in&s;tance of &s;overeignty in pardoning a criminal, condemned for murder, &s;hews the attention of the Supreme Executive of the State to</HI> ju&s;tice, <HI>as well as clemency. It was a free and generous act of grace; but a rea&s;on exciting it, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be, &s;ome evidence appearing after the trial, in favour of the criminal, which was judged material; and which the jury on the trial certified, would, if it had been adduced, have altered the verdict, from murder, to man-&s;laughter.</HI></P>

<Q>THUS IT IS WRITTEN, AND THUS IT BE|HOVED CHRIST TO SUFFER, AND TO RISE FROM THE DEAD THE THIRD DAY: AND THAT REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF SINS SHOULD BE PREACHED IN HIS NAME, AMONG ALL NATIONS; BE|GINNING AT JE|RUSALEM.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HE who <HI>made</HI> all things, is GOD. To whom do we owe our <HI>obedience,</HI> but to him who gave us <HI>being?</HI> From whom mu&s;t we derive <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> but from <HI>him,</HI> who placed Man in a <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>happy</HI> State? That Man, as he came out of the forming hands of GOD, was holy, and con&s;equently happy, the &s;criptures inform us.
<PB N="8" REF="024540_0006_0FC7B05E3ADC5C00">
That the ca&s;e is now, with us, <HI>far otherwi&s;e,</HI> we may &s;ee by &s;ad experience, as well as are told in the word of GOD, The &s;ame revelation teach|es us the fatal cau&s;e of &s;o generally calamitous a &s;tate.&mdash;<HI>By the &s;in of man.</HI> <Q>By one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in; and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned.</Q></P>
<P>ON this occa&s;ion, <HI>mercy</HI> triumphed, GOD, moved with pity toward us, to the glory of his wi&s;dom and grace, provided a way for our relief; and gave a promi&s;e of a Saviour, who &s;hould be "the &s;eed of the woman," and being <HI>the Won|derful Per&s;on,</HI> God <HI>with us,</HI> the SON of GOD in human nature, &s;hould open to man a door of <HI>hope,</HI> the way of return to GOD and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>HE was long foretold by the prophets.&mdash;At length the promi&s;ed Saviour appears: But in a very different <HI>manner</HI> from what was generally expected by the Jews. They being in &s;ubjection to the Romans, and entertaining high notions of "the Me&s;&s;iah" promi&s;ed, looked for him as a <HI>temporal</HI> Prince and Saviour, to deliver them from <HI>that</HI> bondage; little con&s;idering their need of him as a Saviour from the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of bondage, from &s;in, guilt, and its dreadful con&s;equence, eternal death. Too many, like them, would rejoice at
<PB N="9" REF="024540_0007_0FC7B05F2CB12980">
the news of a Saviour and deliverer from the evils and &s;ufferings of <HI>this</HI> life, and <HI>temporal</HI> death; but &s;ee not their <HI>need</HI> of one, to re&s;cue them from more <HI>fatal</HI> evils&mdash;from the power of &s;in, and Satan, and from death eternal. But the <HI>an|gel</HI> gave him the name of JESUS, for this rea|&s;on, "becau&s;e he &s;hould <HI>&s;ave his people</HI> from their &s;ins."</P>
<P>THIS <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> notion, however, infected the nation in general. Even the cho&s;en di&s;ciples were not free from it. As "two of them walk|ed" together on "the third day" after his cru|cifixion, and JESUS joined their company, (he being ri&s;en) "they were talking" of the me|lancholy event of his death, as it appeared to them; and they &s;aid to him, "We tru&s;ted it had been he, who &s;hould have "redeemed I&s;rael." In the evening of the &s;ame day, when the di&s;ciples were "a&s;&s;embled together," he came and "&s;tood in the mid&s;t, and &s;aid, <Q>Peace be unto you: But they were terrified and affrighted; and &s;up|po&s;ed they had &s;een a &s;pirit: But he &s;hewed them his hands and his feet,</Q> which were wounded on "the cro&s;s;" yet they were hardly per&s;uaded that it was <HI>he.</HI> <Q>And he &s;aid unto them, The&s;e are the words which I &s;pake un|to you while I was yet with you, that all things
<PB N="10" REF="024540_0008_0FC7B06133C65178">
mu&s;t be fulfilled which were written in the law of Mo&s;es, &amp; in the prophets, and in the p&s;alms concerning me: Then opened he their under|&s;tanding that they might under&s;tand the &s;crip|tures: And &s;aid unto them</Q> (as in our text) <HI>Thus it is written, and thus it behaved CHRIST to &s;uffer, and to ri&s;e from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name, among all nations; begin|ning at Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>HERE we find CHRIST him&s;elf explaining to <HI>them</HI> and to <HI>us</HI> the whole my&s;tery and nece&s;|&s;ity of his incarnation, death and re&s;urrection; and preaching to &s;inners, <HI>repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, in his name</HI>&mdash;that, in that very <HI>way</HI> by which the di&s;ciples were &s;o much &s;tumbled, and which was &s;o contrary to <HI>human</HI> wi&s;dom, and the general expectation of the <HI>favored</HI> people of I&s;rael, he was to bring <HI>Salvation</HI> and <HI>Redemption</HI> to men. The very mention of which, methinks, if rightly con&s;idered, is enough to melt down the harde&s;t heart, and to &s;often it to compliance; <HI>Thus it behoved CHRIST to &s;uffer, and to ri&s;e from the dead the third day,</HI> with this expre&s;s de|&s;ign, <HI>that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name,</HI> and that &s;o exten&s;ively, <HI>among all nations, beginning at Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the
<PB N="11" REF="024540_0009_0FC7B064E8DEAD50">
&s;cene of his &s;ufferings, and to them by whom he had been &s;o lately, &s;o cruelly treated and mur|dered. Behold the extent and degree of his compa&s;&s;ion! And what relief is here for the &s;in|ner; guilty, undone and helple&s;s! Let the crowd of ideas of &s;in, guilt, ruin and the ample reme|dy provided, deeply affect us, while we proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>I. <HI>The foundation and encouragement for re|pentance, and forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, from the death and re&s;urrection of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>II. <HI>The nature and nece&s;&s;ity of repentance.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>The connexion of forgivene&s;s in the name and for the &s;ake of CHRIST, with it.</HI></P>
<P>I. Then, we are to con&s;ider the <HI>foundation and encouragement for repentance</HI> and <HI>forgivene&s;s</HI> of &s;ins, from the <HI>death</HI> and <HI>re&s;urrection of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> law, the law of <HI>nature,</HI> gave no in|timation of it.&mdash;That GOD &s;hould <HI>require our obedience,</HI> he thought right and &s;it. The law which requires it, expre&s;&s;es his will, and ari&s;es from his nature: It mu&s;t therefore be holy, ju&s;t and good, as him&s;elf; and unchangeable, like him&s;elf&mdash;That he &s;hould <HI>puni&s;h</HI> man, if he di&s;|obeyed, he deemed but <HI>ju&s;t:</HI> Ju&s;tice, his per|fections, and good moral government required it: As in a good civil government, it is requi|&s;ite
<PB N="12" REF="024540_0010_0FC7B06911E47D78">
and nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the whole, that tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors be puni&s;hed, according to the good laws of the State. In either ca&s;e, to be <HI>&s;orry,</HI> does not make &s;ufficient <HI>amends;</HI> even if the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or &s;hould really di&s;cover &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Now, the covenant which man was placed un|der, at his creation, required, as was mo&s;t &s;it and &s;uitable for the holy GOD to require, a perfect obedience of him <HI>per&s;onally</HI> as the condition of <HI>life.</HI> A <HI>threatening,</HI> to deter him, was annexed to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law, in which the <HI>promi&s;e</HI> of it was implied; a threatening adapted to his &s;ituation, as <HI>living happy</HI> in GOD's like|ne&s;s and favor; even <HI>death,</HI> implying the lo&s;s of that happy life and a &s;en&s;e of it, and together therewith, a &s;en&s;e of the di&s;plea&s;ure of his Ma|ker, whom he offended. The threatening again&s;t di&s;obedience was <HI>po&s;itive;</HI> as in the prohibition of <Q>eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil: In the day that thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</Q> As it related to an <HI>intelli|gent</HI> being, as man, and there were no intimati|ons of an e&s;cape from it, there was implied an eternal &s;en&s;e of lo&s;s, and con&s;equent &s;uffering of the anger of GOD, a &s;en&s;e of good, lo&s;t, and e|vil, procured, which is that <HI>death,</HI> which "is the
<PB N="13" REF="024540_0011_0FC7B075C0585D18">
<HI>wages of &s;in:"</HI> For who can endure this, for|ever and ever, and not be &s;aid to <HI>die</HI> eternally?</P>
<P>MAN di&s;obeyed; and <HI>death</HI> was the con&s;e|quence. It began to take place <HI>immediately. </HI> It mu&s;t have followed in the full extent, if mer|cy had not interpo&s;ed: We feel it in part: There is a foreboding of mi&s;ery, in this world, in the <HI>awakened</HI> con&s;cience. This is but the begin|ning of &s;orrows, an anticipation in part, or fore|ta&s;te of that "<HI>death,</HI>" which "is the wages of &s;in." But yet there is no di&s;po&s;ition of heart to <HI>repent,</HI> nor <HI>encouragement,</HI> that, repenting, he may be forgiven; till the grace of the go&s;pel is open|ed to his view.</P>
<P>IN the covenant of <HI>works</HI> there was no <HI>room</HI> for repentance; no condition on which pardon might be obtained, if man &s;inned; nor provi|&s;ion for any relief. What then mu&s;t be the con&s;equence? Mu&s;t the whole race of men pe|ri&s;h for ever, &s;eeing we are told that "all have &s;inned?" The <HI>go&s;pel</HI> brings us <HI>good news, glad tidings</HI> of <HI>pardon</HI> for the rebellious, upon their repentance; that <HI>&s;inners may repent,</HI> and re|penting may be <HI>forgiven;</HI> and if forgiven, then received to the <HI>favor</HI> of their offended Creator, and be <HI>happy</HI> in him, and with him for ever. The <HI>new covenant,</HI> emphatically called the <HI>covenant of
<PB N="14" REF="024540_0012_0FC7B077317846B0">
grace,</HI> provides for this. Nothing but <HI>free</HI> and <HI>&s;overeign</HI> grace could provide relief, or give any ground of <HI>hope.</HI></P>
<P>THE text informs us of the <HI>way</HI> in which it is brought about, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by the <HI>death</HI> and <HI>re&s;urrecti|on</HI> of JESUS CHRIST. The &s;inner, as he could &s;ee no <HI>room</HI> for repentance, or <HI>way</HI> to e&s;|cape, &s;o he could have no <HI>power</HI> or <HI>di&s;po&s;ition of heart</HI> to repent or <HI>hope</HI> for forgivene&s;s. Divine wi&s;dom and grace contrived a plan, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by the mediation and &s;acrifice of JESUS CHRIST. To "deliver us from going down to the pit" of eternal death. GOD " has found a ran&s;om:" The <HI>death</HI> of CHRIST is <HI>the ran&s;om;</HI> and his re&s;urrection from the dead te&s;tifies its &s;ufficiency, and acceptablene&s;s with GOD on <HI>our</HI> behalf. This lays the <HI>foundation of encouragement</HI> to re|pent, and hope for the forgivene&s;s of &s;in.</P>
<P>THIS was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> GOD did not &s;ee it <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>&s;uitable,</HI> though his <HI>mercy</HI> is <HI>&s;o great,</HI> to give his holy SPIRIT to work in &s;inners a di&s;po&s;i|tion to repent, and in a meer <HI>Sovereign</HI> way to pardon their &s;ins, without a &s;atisfaction; &s;o great is the <HI>evil</HI> of &s;in, and the <HI>di&s;honor</HI> it ca&s;ts on him and his government; as it &s;trikes at the founda|tion of all moral obligation, and even aims to ca&s;t GOD out of his throne. His <HI>law</HI> mu&s;t be
<PB N="15" REF="024540_0013_0FC7B078B1BFF258">
honored, which is thereby violated, and ju&s;tice &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>THE covenant of <HI>redemption,</HI> which is to us the covenant of <HI>grace,</HI> provides that this be done by a <HI>&s;urety;</HI> and that the SON of GOD be the per&s;on; that in order thereto, he take <HI>our nature</HI> and become <HI>man</HI>&mdash;be made under the law which we had broken, and be made a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> for us, by &s;uffering the <HI>accur&s;ed death</HI> of the cro&s;s; that we might be freed from the cur&s;e. As <HI>death</HI> was the <HI>po&s;itive threatening</HI> to man, for &s;ins &s;o, the death of CHRIST on the cro&s;s, as <HI>our &s;urety,</HI> &s;ecures the honor of GOD's law, truth and ju&s;tice, thereby to make an atonement: As the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> was the <HI>altar</HI> on which he of|fered the <HI>&s;acrifice,</HI> "which &s;anctifies the gift;" it was of infinite value in the &s;ight of GOD. As he is a <HI>Divine</HI> Per&s;on, GOD e&s;teemed his death a &s;ufficient <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> to his ju&s;tice, as a manife&s;tation of his righteous <HI>di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> again&s;t &s;in. This he te&s;tified to all worlds, by <HI>rai&s;ing</HI> him from the dead, as he foretold, on the <HI>third</HI> day: For, as he died a victim to divine ju&s;tice for the &s;ins of men, he could not otherwi&s;e have been relea&s;ed from the bands of the grave, than by having made full &s;atisfaction: By which, he e&s;tabli&s;hed this as the <HI>only way</HI> for &s;inners to en|tertain
<PB N="16" REF="024540_0014_0FC7B07A2C9D7688">
<HI>hope,</HI> as laying the foundation for the <HI>ho|norable</HI> exerci&s;e of mercy, and of be&s;towment of the gift of the holy SPIRIT, to work repen|tance in their hearts. In con&s;equence of which, <HI>repentance</HI> and <HI>pardon</HI> are proclaimed to a guil|ty world.</P>
<P>OF this atonement, the prophets foretold, and the law of Mo&s;es te&s;tified, by the &s;acrifices there|in in&s;tituted; this &s;ignifying, that without <Q>&s;hed|ding of blood there is no remi&s;&s;ion.

<P><PB N="17" REF="024540_0015_0FC7B0842C4DB0A8">
WHICH brings us to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>II. <HI>The nature and nece&s;&s;ity of Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the work of a <HI>&s;inner.</HI> Before man &s;inned, he was required to obey the law and keep all the commandments of GOD. But <HI>re|pentance</HI> was no part of his religion.&mdash;But &s;ince the <HI>fall,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary; and no religion can be accepted without it. It is the <HI>proper</HI> work of a &s;inner: His <HI>character calls</HI> for it, and makes it <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</HI> If there were any <HI>without &s;in,</HI> they would have no <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> for Repentance: <Q>But now, GOD commandeth all men every where to repent.</Q> Sin gives <HI>cau&s;e</HI> for Repentance. It occa&s;ions <HI>&s;orrow of heart,</HI> when rightly view|ed, as well as brings the &s;orrow of <HI>&s;uffering.</HI> When it is a <Q>godly &s;orrow, it worketh Repen|tance, to Salvation; not to be repented of: but the &s;orrow of the world,</Q> or that which is merely of a worldly nature, "worketh death."</P>
<P>A di&s;tinction therefore is nece&s;&s;ary. Repen|tance implies in its nature <HI>conviction</HI> of &s;in&mdash;an <HI>afflictive</HI> &s;en&s;e and <HI>heart-aching</HI> for it. But not <HI>merely</HI> a conviction, as having done evil, and <HI>di&s;tre&s;s</HI> of mind ari&s;ing therefrom: So, <Q><HI>Judas</HI> that betrayed</Q> his Lord <Q>repented him&s;elf, &s;aying, I have &s;inned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood:&mdash;And he ca&s;t down the
<PB N="18" REF="024540_0016_0FC7B085A6362290">
pieces of &s;ilver in the temple, and departed and went and hanged him&s;elf:</Q> Such was his <HI>torment</HI> and <HI>de&s;pair.</HI> But, this was not the <HI>Repentance</HI> to which there is a promi&s;e of <HI>remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI></P>
<P>"REPENTANCE is a &s;aving grace, and a ne|ce&s;&s;ary mean of attaining life and Salvation," wrought by the SPIRIT of GOD in the heart; which is a <HI>further</HI> operation of the SPIRIT, be|yond <HI>conviction</HI> of &s;in; imparting a &s;en&s;e of the <HI>evil</HI> of it, as again&s;t GOD. The hearts of all per&s;ons, by nature, are <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>in&s;en&s;ible</HI> of &s;in; not only as to its <HI>moral</HI> evil, but its <HI>ill de&s;ert.</HI>&mdash;The SPIRIT of GOD, who&s;e operations are the effect of CHRIST's purcha&s;e, a&s;&s;i&s;ting na|tural con&s;cience to do its office, "convinces of &s;in," and awakens to a <HI>concern</HI> for their &s;afety. This may be <HI>preparatory</HI> to <HI>true</HI> repentance. So that he who has not had a real <HI>conviction</HI> of &s;in and guilt, and been awakened to a <HI>deep concern</HI> "what he &s;hall do to be &s;aved," has not repent|ed; he is yet blind and hardened.</P>
<P>IN <HI>true repentance</HI> there is a <HI>clearer conviction</HI> of &s;in&mdash;it di&s;covers its <HI>evil nature,</HI> as again&s;t GOD; and &s;o &s;ets the <HI>guilt</HI> of it in a ju&s;ter light; even the guilt of the lea&s;t &s;in appears great.

<P>SORROW of heart is an attendant of this grief, and mourning for &s;in and confe&s;&s;ion of it.

<P>HUMILIATION before GOD, and <HI>brokene&s;s of heart</HI> for &s;in is another attendant of true repen|tance. He is brought down from all high thoughts of him&s;elf, of his own worthine&s;s and goodne&s;s. His proud, &s;tubborn &s;pirit is broken; which before was "as a bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke," and he is brought to &s;ubmit to GOD's government, as ju&s;t and right. He lies low, as it were at GOD's foot&s;tool, &s;en&s;ible of his de&s;ert of his dreadful di&s;plea&s;ure; and that he is ju&s;t in his threatenings, and would be &s;o in his damnation; and therefore that his only hope is in his mercy. However great di&s;tre&s;s and horror of con&s;cience the legal penitent may feel for &s;in, he is not <HI>humbled:</HI> He continues as proud|hearted and &s;tubborn, as oppo&s;ite to GOD in

<P>THE true penitent thus humbled, ca&s;ts him|&s;elf, at the feet of a <HI>Sovereign</HI> and <HI>merciful</HI> GOD, as one de&s;erving death and damnation, having nothing to plead but <HI>free grace.</HI> In which ca&s;e, the way is opened for his compliance with the <HI>go&s;pel;</HI> the <HI>&s;cope</HI> and <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of which are to aba&s;e the pride of man, and exalt the glory of GOD: Wherein his ju&s;tice is a&s;&s;erted, the honor of his government &s;ecured, and mercy exerci&s;ed to the &s;inner, penitent and believing in the atonement and righteou&s;ne&s;s of JESUS CHRIST, which alone give relief and comfort.

de&s;pair, and foundation of the hope of forgivene&s;s. The free mercy of GOD in pro|viding a Saviour,&mdash;the mediation of CHRIST&mdash;his perfect obedience to the Divine law, and his &s;ufferings and death upon the cro&s;s, afford the only encouragement to a &s;inner to think of returning to GOD, to a&s;k and hope for a pardon of his &s;ins, and for favor with his offended Cre|ator, and a principal mean of &s;oftening the heart of a rebel to a compliance with the offer of mer|cy. As the law of GOD pronounces a cur&s;e in po&s;itive terms upon him that fails of fulfilling it, the &s;inner mu&s;t have &s;o remained under the &s;en|tence, &amp; in hardened oppo&s;ition again&s;t GOD, un|le&s;s &s;oftened by the <HI>emollients of grace.</HI> The <HI>te&s;|timony</HI> of GOD in his word, of CHRIST be|coming our &s;urety, bearing our &s;ins on the cro&s;s, paying our debt of &s;uffering, and procuring a righteou&s;ne&s;s for our ju&s;tification, <HI>i.e. </HI> for all that embrace him, being received by <HI>faith,</HI> is this ble&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;oftening remedy,</HI> that draws, that wins, that gains the heart of a &s;inner; that otherwi&s;e would dread and &s;hun with aver&s;ion the pre&s;ence of GOD&mdash;that cau&s;e him to relent, to repent of his &s;ins and oppo&s;ition again&s;t him, and glad|ly, thankfully, and obediently to return to him, in the name of and with faith in this glori|ous

all-&s;ufficient Saviour, and with hope in the mercy of GOD. Which faith, implies not only an a&s;&s;ent of the mind, to the truth of the go&s;pel, but a con&s;ent of the heart and will, to this way of Salvation; and a cordial receiving of and tru&s;ting in this great Redeemer, his atonement and righteou&s;ne&s;s, for pardon, acceptance to the favor of GOD, grace for &s;anctification and con|&s;olation, and eternal life. Thus, <HI>repentance</HI> and <HI>faith,</HI> when either is true and genuine, are in&s;epa|rably united; and "repentance," thus connected with faith, is "unto Salvation," "and not to be repented of;" but is followed with the joy of par|don.</P>
<P>I WOULD briefly add, as a <HI>mark</HI> of go&s;pel-re|pentance, that it is accompanied and followed with <HI>hatred</HI> of &s;in, re&s;olution of heart again&s;t and for&s;aking it in practice, and turning to the LORD in new obedience. The true penitent, it appears from this view of the &s;ubject, expe|riences and e&s;&s;ential change of mind, and change of heart. All the powers of his mind are turn|ed from their former bias; &s;in is imbittered, a fixed <HI>hatred</HI> of all &s;in ari&s;es in the heart; &s;o that he becomes an irreconcileable enemy to it, in e|very from and degree; even when his &s;en&s;ible grief, &s;orrow and mourning for it is a&s;&s;uaged

and abated, by the comforts of the holy GHOST, and &s;en&s;e of pardon: His <HI>hatred</HI> of &s;in ari&s;es from a view of its <HI>evil nature,</HI> and contrariety to GOD and his law, and continues and increa|&s;es in proportion to his experiences of his grace and manife&s;tations of his love. The &s;ame view and &s;en&s;e of &s;in, will influence him to <HI>turn</HI> from it; as it is natural to <HI>fly</HI> from that which we <HI>hate:</HI> He therefore for&s;akes &s;in, &amp; turns to the LORD; he is made willing to &s;ubmit to his government, and to give up him&s;elf to him in an everla&s;ting covenant, never to be forgotten; re&s;igning him|&s;elf to him and his di&s;po&s;al, in life, and death, and to all eternity. As he before "walked contra|ry to GOD, after the imagination of his own heart," he now "walks with GOD," in faith and love, <Q>with purpo&s;e of heart cleaves to the LORD,</Q> and <Q>brings forth fruit meet for repentance; being made free from &s;in," as to its dominion, and become a &s;ervant to GOD, he has his fruit unto holine&s;s, and his end e|verla&s;ting life.</Q></P>
<P>Now, we may ob&s;erve, repentance is <HI>nece&s;&s;a|ry</HI> in the <HI>nature</HI> of things, as it is a laying down the weapons of rebellion again&s;t GOD, and a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his government in CHRIST, the mediator and "king whom he hath &s;et in Zion:"

merit of the blood or &s;ufferings and death of the Son of GOD; which is &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, for <HI>any,</HI> and for <HI>all</HI> the human race; So that whoever of "all nations," ages and condi|tions does truly repent, may be a&s;&s;ured by the word of GOD, of the remi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ins, in the name and for the &s;ake of CHRIST; it be|ing accompanied with <HI>faith</HI> in him, as, it implies, not merely <HI>a&s;king</HI> for mercy and forgivene&s;s in his name, but receiving him, and relying on his infinite atonement. For this end he <HI>&s;uffered,</HI> that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name, <HI>among all nations, begin|ning at Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the &s;ence of his &s;ufferings:&mdash;to the very <HI>people</HI> and <HI>per&s;ons</HI> who had been per|petrators of the horrid crime of the murder of the SON of GOD. By which is held up the idea of the infinite merit of his death, and of the riches of GOD's grace, with the freene&s;s of par|don to the greate&s;t offenders; as well as, that it is his will, that pardon &s;hould be <HI>fir&s;t</HI> offered to a <HI>covenanted</HI> people, who have revolted from him, and that <HI>back&s;liders</HI> &s;hould be called to repen|tance, and be a&s;&s;ured of forgivene&s;s, upon their repentance; <Q>though their &s;ins be as &s;carlet, and though they be red like crim&s;on,</Q> ever &s;o ag|gravated and heinous; to &s;hew them that GOD

there is "joy in heaven over one &s;inner that re|pents," &s;o peculiarly is GOD plea&s;ed with it, <Q>more than over ninety and nine ju&s;t per&s;ons that need no repentance,</Q> if any &s;uch there were; "becau&s;e he delighteth in mercy."&mdash;But, enough has been &s;aid to &s;hew the unfailing <HI>con|nexion of forgivene&s;s, in the name and for the &s;ake of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>with repentance.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL now endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t your <HI>improve|ment</HI> of what has been &s;aid.&mdash;And let us re|mark,</P>
<P N="1">1. WHAT a <HI>wonderful plan</HI> is that revealed in the go&s;pel, for the relief of &s;inners; ruined and helple&s;s! When man, being under a righteous law of GOD, requiring his obedience, had &s;in|ned, brought guilt and ruin on him&s;elf and his po&s;terity, and was &s;hut up under a &s;entence of condemnation, to eternal death, without a gleam of hope; the mercy of God appeared for the re|lief of the helple&s;s! his wi&s;dom contrived the way; a plan, at which heaven and earth may well &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed!&mdash;that the SON of GOD &s;hould come down into our world, take our na|ture, "being found in fa&s;hion as a man," yea, "make him&s;elf of no reputation," but "take upon him the form of a &s;ervant"&mdash;obey the law which we had broken, and die the accur&s;ed
<PB N="35" REF="024540_0033_0FC7B0CDA12CF350">
and ignominious death of the cro&s;s, to &s;atisfy divine ju&s;tice, for our &s;ins&mdash;that GOD might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of the &s;inner that will believe in him, with repentance of &s;ins&mdash;that the &s;inner might repent, and repenting, might be forgiven: a plan, wherein <Q>mercy and truth are met together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have embraced each other.</Q>&mdash;Well may the "angels" intently "look into the&s;e things!" But, how much more, &s;hould <HI>we</HI> be deeply affected with and admire the wonderful &s;cheme of divine wi&s;dom and grace! For, though <Q>the preaching of CHRIST crucified, was, unto the Jews a &s;tumbling-block, and unto the Greeks fooli&s;h|ne&s;s,</Q> and is &s;o, to many, in the pre&s;ent age; <Q>yet, unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks,</Q> and of whatever nation, <Q>CHRIST the power of GOD and the wi&s;dom of GOD.</Q></P>
<P N="2">From what has been &s;aid, we may &s;ee the propriety, and nece&s;&s;ity, that &s;inners be deeply <HI>concerned</HI> what will become of them&mdash;<Q>what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved.</Q> A &s;inner, out of CHRIST, is an <HI>undone</HI> creature; &amp;, in him&s;elf, helple&s;s: Guilt hands heavy upon him, and &s;in hinders his return to GOD;&mdash;he is in the road to final, remedile&s;s ruin, and nothing but &s;overeign mercy can prevent it.&mdash;If any &s;ituation, that

can be imagined on this &s;ide of <HI>eternal</HI> mi&s;ery calls for <HI>concern,</HI> this does: <HI>That</HI> indeed, in tho&s;e regions of de&s;pair, would be of no avail; but <HI>this</HI> may; as they are yet within the limits of mercy; it is with them <HI>a day of grace:</HI> The go&s;pel opens to &s;inners a glorious door of <HI>hope;</HI> but, it is only an hope that they <HI>may</HI> become the &s;ubjects of the &s;pecial grace of GOD, and ob|tain peace and reconciliation with him.&mdash;For &s;inners, while within the reach of mercy, to be concerned "what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved," may be attended with the happie&s;t con&s;equences: As the direction of the prophet is adapted to them, "Turn ye to the &s;trong hold, ye pri&s;on|ers of hope". For,</P>
<P N="3">3. THE only con&s;i&s;tent and &s;atisfactory ad|vice that can be given to &s;uch enquirers, is that given by the apo&s;tles, Peter and Paul, upon like occa&s;ions, "<HI>Repent</HI>&mdash;Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST": Peter, added, to them who were not baptized&mdash;"And be baptized every one of you in the name of JESUS CHRIST, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins," which is of the &s;ame import with Paul's direction, "Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST:" For, repentance and faith mu&s;t go together&mdash;they cannot be &s;eparated, if true and real: And a promi&s;e is implied, or ex|pre&s;t,

<P N="4">4. To become a true <HI>penitent</HI> for &s;in, and &s;o, to be entitled to the forgivene&s;s of it, implies, <HI>a great change</HI> in the per&s;on's &s;tate and condition, both <HI>real</HI> and <HI>relative:</HI> It mu&s;t come from the heart; there mu&s;t be an awakening out of &s;ecurity, conviction of &s;in&mdash;a &s;en&s;e of the evil of it&mdash;real grief, mourning, &s;elf-loathing, with &s;orrow of heart for it, hatred of and re&s;olution to for&s;ake it, and faith in the LORD JESUS CHRIST; a faith, that "purifieth the heart;" and "worketh by love:" In &s;hort, there mu&s;t be a change of <HI>nature,</HI> producing, as there is opportunity, amendment of <HI>life.</HI> It is &s;o great a change, that it is expre&s;t by the Saviour, by be|ing "born again:" without which, he mo&s;t po&s;i|tively declares, no per&s;on "can &s;ee" or <Q>enter into the kingdom of GOD.</Q> The <HI>relative</HI> change, is equally great, in his being pardoned, and acquitted from guilt; that <Q>he &s;hall not come into condemnation; but is pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life:</Q> become a favorite of GOD, and an heir of glory.</P>

<P><HI>SOLEMN, intere&s;ting, and affecting have been the &s;cenes, which have pa&s;&s;ed before you, within the&s;e &s;acred walls. You have &s;een the human judgment &s;et, and the books opened.

You have heard the &s;entence of death pronounced, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and affecting manner, while every heart &s;huddered, and every eye wept. You have &s;een the unhappy Pri&s;oner, wearing the badges of his guilt, from &s;abbath to &s;abbath pre&s;ented to wor&s;hip before GOD, with the expectation that the &s;entence would &s;oon be execu|ted.

A&s;&s;em|bled this morning to improve the&s;e Providences, and to &s;eek wi&s;dom and grace from him, who gives liberally and upbraids not, our ears have been &s;a|luted with the voice of pardon; we have &s;een the grace re&s;erved in the bo&s;om of our Con&s;titution called into exerci&s;e, the &s;hackles knocked off, and

the Pri&s;oner &s;et at liberty. While we congratu|late our&s;elves, and one another, that the &s;olemn e|vent of this week is by this grace prevented, let us direct our meditations to the judgment that is to come, and, from an earthly tribunal, a&s;cend to that which is above, where we mu&s;t be arraigned, and receive a decided &s;entence. The words that are cho&s;en as a motto to this di&s;cour&s;e are in the</HI> Epi&s;|tle of JUDE, the latter part of the &s;ixth ver&s;e.
<Q>THE JUDGMENT OF THE GREAT DAY.</Q></P>
<P>THERE <HI>is a &s;pirit in man, and the in&s;pira|tion of the Almighty giveth him under&s;tanding.</HI> We are made capable of reflecting upon events that are pa&s;t, and of reviewing the way in which we have walked. We are al&s;o capable of an|ticipating events certainly future, of contem|plating &s;cenes in which we mu&s;t be actors, and of con&s;idering what manner of per&s;ons we ought to be. In the due exerci&s;e of the&s;e faculties, con&s;i&s;ts much of our duty, our wi&s;dom, and our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>AMONG events that are future, the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn and intere&s;ting, are DEATH and JUDG|MENT.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="024540_0048_0FC7B106680BF7E8">
IN the found human mind, there is no doubt, I believe, of the futurition of the&s;e events. We &s;ee that death pa&s;&s;es upon all men. We feel the &s;entence in our&s;elves; and we mu&s;t be &s;trangely inattentive, if we are not convinced, that <HI>the days approach that we mu&s;t die.</HI></P>
<P>DEATH would not be &s;o intere&s;tingly &s;olemn and important, were it not for the judgment that follows, and the eternity that &s;ucceeds. If death put a period to our being, if all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s cea&s;ed with the la&s;t ga&s;p of life, though, con|&s;tituted as we are, we could not but &s;tartle at <HI>this</HI> de&s;truction, yet it would be our duty to for|get or brave the great event, and indulge our heart in all its joys: But the &s;troke that returns the body to the du&s;t, returns the immortal &s;pirit to GOD who gave it, from him to receive a deci|ded &s;entence, according to its true character, and the deeds done in the body.</P>
<P>DIVINE impre&s;&s;ions cannot be wholly era&s;ed;
<Q><L><HI>There's a divinity that &s;tirs within us,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That trembles at futurity,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And intimates eternity to man.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Con&s;cience, the vicegerent of heaven in the human brea&s;t, though it may be benumbed by infidelity, &s;tupified by &s;en&s;uality, and have its ordinary voice drowned in carnal plea&s;ures, will &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ert its dignity, arre&s;t the &s;inner,

and place him, trembling at the bar of GOD. There has been no nation &s;o barbarous as not to acknowledge the being of a GOD; neither has there been any &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent, as, with this acknowledgment, to deny him the right of governing and judging the creatures he has made, according to their capacities and de&s;erts. But it is not my de&s;ign to offer proofs of a day of Judgment, GOD has written it up|on every man's con&s;cience, <HI>and given a&s;&s;urance unto all men in that he hath rai&s;ed JESUS CHRIST from the dead.</HI></P>
<P>My de&s;ign is, to meditate a little upon the greatne&s;s of this day&mdash;To contemplate it with reference to our intere&s;t in it&mdash;and endea|vour to make &s;uch an improvement as may be profitable to us.</P>
<P>WHILE I am &s;peaking, may that GOD, at who&s;e tribunal we mu&s;t appear, &s;olemnize our minds, aid our meditations, and &s;o realize to our view, the things we contemplate, that they may have a powerful practical influence upon us, and in&s;trumentally prepare us to meet our JUDGE, "when he &s;hall come to be gorified in his &s;aints, and to be admired in all them that believe."</P>
<P>THE &s;oul, at death, returns to GOD who gave it, and there is, doubtle&s;s, &s;omething like

<P>YOUR condition, my friends, is dangerous, but it is not de&s;perate&mdash;It is yet an accepted time, and a day of Salvation&mdash;You are on pray|ing-ground&mdash;You have a &s;pace for repentance&mdash;The throne of grace is acce&s;&s;ible&mdash;You have an ADVOCATE with the FATHER&mdash;You have the offers of mercy&mdash;GOD, though not &s;lack concerning his promi&s;es, as &s;ome men count &s;lackne&s;s, <HI>is long-&s;uffering, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h; but that all &s;hould come to repent|ance.</HI></P>
<P>THE blood of CHRIST is &s;ufficient to an|&s;wer all your guilt, to cancel all your crimes, and take out all your &s;tains. It was &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the humbled Mana&s;&s;ah, who had &s;old him&s;elf to work wickedne&s;s; and who had made the people of I&s;rael to do wor&s;e than the hea|then&mdash;to purge away the pollutions of a Mary Magdalene, and the crim&s;oned guilt of the cru|cifying

JESUS CHRIST by faith. See that you ob|tain the regenerating influences of the HOLY SPIRIT&mdash;a &s;ealed pardon of all your &s;ins, and that you &s;ecure an inheritance, among them that are &s;anctified. Give not &s;leep to your eyes, nor &s;lumber to your eye-lids, 'till you have made &s;ome &s;erious effort to e&s;cape from hell and fly to heaven.

that precious immortal principle which mu&s;t exi&s;t forever, and unle&s;s you repent and be|lieve in CHRIST, mu&s;t exi&s;t in mi&s;ery. Is it po&s;&s;ible to be too much engaged for &s;uch an ob|ject, in &s;uch circum&s;tances? Let me then urge and entreat you, by all that is intere&s;ting and important in time and eternity, by the value you &s;et upon your own &s;ouls, by the mercies of GOD, and the blood of the Cro&s;s, to break off your &s;ins by repentance, and lay hold on eternal life. Fly to the SAVIOUR, and yield your&s;elves up as condemned malefactors, yet hoping in his mercy, that he will forgive your &s;ins, cancel all your guilt, and re&s;cue you from condemnation. If you do, truly, repent, and believe in CHRIST, the pro&s;pect of this day and its intere&s;ting con|&s;equences, will be gloriou&s;ly changed; for its ter|rors &s;often into the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;olemnity, in the view and expectation of the a&s;&s;ured chri&s;tian.

by a living faith&mdash;being comfortably per&s;uaded of this mighty change, he knows, that there <HI>is no condemnation due unto him.</HI> He &s;ees an infinite fulne&s;s in CHRIST to &s;ecure and defend him, and the pro&s;pect of the Judgment awakens &s;en|timents in his brea&s;t &s;imilar to tho&s;e which the SAVIOUR encouraged, when he &s;aid, <HI>When the&s;e things begin to come to pa&s;s, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.</HI></P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;ured believers in CHRIST look for|ward to this augu&s;t &s;ea&s;on, as the time of their complete deliverance; when their poor bodies of humiliation, that have long been kept, by the care of heaven, in the bed of death, &s;hall be rai&s;|ed <HI>incorruptible,</HI> be fa&s;hioned like to CHRIST's <HI>glorious body</HI> and being re-united with their alrea|dy glorified &s;pirits, they &s;hall be confirmed in happine&s;s, &s;uited to their natures, and eternal as their duration.&mdash;Though it does not yet appear what they &s;hall be, they, neverthele&s;s, know, <HI>that when he who is their life &s;hall appear, they &s;hall be like him for they &s;hall &s;ee him as he is, and &s;hall appear with him in glory.</HI> The trum|pet of the Archangel, which will be a terror to the wicked, will be mu&s;ic in their ears; With tran&s;port they will echo to the&s;e accents from heaven, <HI>Awake and &s;ing ye that dwell in du&s;t.</HI></P>

ESPECIALLY is the pro&s;pect of this glorious day, &s;upportingly plea&s;ant to the per&s;ecuted &s;aint, who &s;uffers unju&s;tly from the hands of men.</P>
<P>MANY of the faithful &s;ervants of GOD have had their judgment taken away, in the pre&s;ent life. They have been loaded with reproach which they did not de&s;erve, and hi&s;&s;ed from the &s;tage where they ought to have been applauded: But in that day GOD <HI>will bring forth their righ|teou&s;ne&s;s as the light, and their judgment as the noon day.</HI> And having in this trying particular had fellow&s;hip with CHRIST, in his &s;ufferings, they will al&s;o have fellow&s;hip with him in his glory. Farther,</P>
<P>As the glory of GOD is a dear object with the Saints, and their hearts are pained with the reflections that are ca&s;t upon him, and his ad|mini&s;tration, they rejoice in the pro&s;pect of that glorious &s;ea&s;on, when all the&s;e reflections &s;hall be wiped away, with tran&s;port will they hear, and with rapture will they join, in this heavenly Allelujah, <HI>Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power unto the LORD our GOD, for true and righteous are his judgments.</HI></P>
<P>O ye believers, ye friends of JESUS&mdash;This will be to you a mo&s;t glorious day. The day of your complete triumph. You will reap the

<P>IT will be expected, I pre&s;ume, before I clo&s;e my di&s;cour&s;e, that a few thoughts &s;hould be ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the unhappy man who is the &s;pecial occa&s;ion of our a&s;&s;embling. Among the infelici|ties which have attended the &s;cenes through which the Pri&s;oner has pa&s;&s;ed, it is not the lea&s;t, that his ideas have become &s;o confu&s;ed and deranged, that, at pre&s;ent, he &s;eems &s;carcely capable of moral in&s;truction. We hope the happy change in his &s;tate will be attended with as happy a one in his mind, and that he may yet be com|fortable and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>MY Friend, We view you this day with the mixed emotions of joy and &s;orrow, and we can|not but mingle condolence with our congratu|lations. You have known what it is to be ar|raigned at a human tribunal&mdash;to be tried for your life, upon a mo&s;t awful indictment&mdash;to be found guilty, in the judgment of your peers&mdash;and to have the dreadful &s;entence of death pro|nounced

upon you. You have been bound in affliction and iron, becau&s;e of your tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, and your friends have trembled for your approaching fate: But, in the my&s;teri|ous providence of GOD, events have been &s;o ordered, that the grace of the Commonwealth is extended to your ca&s;e, and his EXCELLENCY the GOVERNOR, and the HONORABLE COUNCIL, have granted you a free and full pardon. We have &s;een your badges of infamy knocked off, and you &s;at at liberty. We congratulate you up|on this happy change. How thankful ought you to be to your great deliverer&mdash;to him who brings the pri&s;oner out of the pri&s;on-hou&s;e&mdash;and chan|ges of the &s;hadows of death into the light of the morning. What emotions of gratitude &s;hould ari&s;e in your brea&s;t toward tho&s;e who have &s;o deeply intere&s;ted them&s;elves in your circum|&s;tances. You can never think of the names of LYMAN, SEWALL, PARSONS, or DAVIS, with|out the tear of &s;en&s;ibility trickling down your cheeks. Your &s;pared life &s;hould be &s;pent in prai&s;ing your deliverer, &amp; praying for your bene|factors: In endeavouring to le&s;&s;en the injury you have done, by &s;oftening the &s;orrows of the wi|dow and fatherle&s;s, reduced to this unhappy &s;tate in your impa&s;&s;ioned moments.

The pardon you have recei|ved extends no farther than to acquit you of your offence again&s;t the laws of your &s;ellow-men.&mdash;<HI>None can forgive &s;ins but GOD only.</HI> If the af|fray with your neighbor was &s;o circum&s;tanced as to reduce your crime below the letter of the indictment, you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that there was great criminality in your conduct. A friend, a fellow-mortal, has been hurried into eternity, in an impa&s;&s;ioned moment, by your deadly weapon.&mdash;Think how you will meet him at the bar of GOD.

<P>LET me then entreat you, if you are capable of receiving the exhortation, to think &s;eriou&s;ly of your &s;ituation. Improve the re&s;pite granted you, to repent &s;incerely of this and all your o|ther

&s;ins&mdash;to obtain an intere&s;t in JESUS CHRIST&mdash;and to te&s;tify to tho&s;e who may know your ca&s;e, and be acquainted with your conduct, that it is indeed a great privilege, that the power of pardoning offences is re&s;erved in the Con&s;titution. And may GOD graciou&s;ly appear for you, re&s;tore you to a &s;ound mind, and give you an inheritance among them that are &s;anctified.&mdash;To conclude,</P>
<P>Is there, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, a day of judgment approaching&mdash;Are the heavens and the earth, which now exi&s;t re&s;erved unto fire&mdash;Let us live under an habitual practical belief, and ex|pectation, of this great event.
