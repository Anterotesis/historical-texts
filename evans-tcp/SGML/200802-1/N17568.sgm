<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>CORNELIA, daughter of Scipio Africanus, and mother of the Gracchi, was not more di&s;tingui&s;hed by the nobility of her rank, than by the lu&s;tre of tho&s;e virtues which adorned her character&mdash;a mo&s;t amiable trait of which &s;hines in that little incident recorded to her immortal ho|nor.

The il|lu&s;trious Roman prolonged the conver&s;a|tion till her children were at hand, and then introducing them to her vi&s;itor:&mdash;"The&s;e, &s;ays &s;he, are my jewels."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>A DESIRE of happine&s;s is the fir&s;t propen&s;ity of the heart.&mdash;It is born with us, and to attempt its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion were equally fruitle&s;s and wrong; for the Author of Nature has done nothing in vain, and the happine&s;s he has imprinted on the mind &s;o clear an idea of, has &s;ome|where an exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Hitherto you have obeyed the impul&s;e of nature in the artle&s;s pur&s;uits of child|hood; but the time is at hand, when this &s;weet tranquillity will be interrupted by the bu&s;tle of the world, which will not longer permit you to repo&s;e in the &s;imple amu&s;e|ments of dre&s;&s;ing dolls, pur&s;uing butter|flies, or plucking dai&s;ies. Sweet dear de|lights of innocence; on which, as you
<PB N="2" REF="022756_0006_0FBA5DEE3318FE60">
climb the rugged heights of life, you will look back with fond regret.</P>
<P>But we are not born for our&s;elves alone; and therefore have duties to perform, obli|gations to di&s;charge, and difficulties to en|counter; in the cour&s;e of which, many a &s;evere check is given to this happine&s;s which we all &s;o ardently &s;eek: yet the de|&s;ire of it will even acquire &s;trength by the repul&s;e, and there was never yet a wretch who had found it dimini&s;hed by misfortune. I wi&s;h the &s;ucce&s;s of this pa&s;&s;ion could be &s;hown as demon&s;trable as its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But the truth is, all mankind are run|ning after the &s;ame object, though in &s;uch oppo&s;ite directions, that if it were not for their concurrent te&s;timony, it would be &s;carce credible that they had each the &s;ame view. Yet it is the fate of mo&s;t of them to &s;it down at la&s;t in the very &s;ame di&s;po&s;i|tion which Solomon was in when he com|plained, rather peevi&s;hly it mu&s;t be owned, that all was vanity and vexation of &s;pirit. Man walks indeed in a vain &s;hadow, and it is pitiable to reflect that a being of &s;o tran&s;ient a duration &s;hould yet wa&s;te the trifling portion of time allotted him in vain and fruitle&s;s pur&s;uits, and after all the
<PB N="3" REF="022756_0007_0FBA5DEFB3A82AB8">
&s;chemes of the &s;anguine, and the labours of the active, to find the de&s;ired attain|ment as far off as ever.</P>
<P>But this has been the ca&s;e of millions, and I am afraid will &s;till continue to be &s;o, at lea&s;t till we are unanimous in deciding on that grand point wherein this good, of which we have all &s;o high an idea, con|&s;i&s;ts: an agreement from which, alas, we are at the farthe&s;t di&s;tance imaginable. And here, my deare&s;t girls, lies the whole of the mi&s;take. The Creator has not been wanting to provide a happine&s;s exalted as the mind it&s;elf can conceive, but man him|&s;elf errs in the pur&s;uit of it; &s;ome placing it in riches, &s;ome in power, &s;carcely on in an age &s;uppo&s;ing it to be where it really is&mdash;in the practice of virtue.</P>
<P>But while the human heart is &s;et on ac|quirements, in which it can find no &s;atis|faction if attained, the &s;pan of life mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be pa&s;&s;ed in re&s;tle&s;s anxieties and melancholy di&s;appointment. It was the aim of philo&s;ophy, to draw ju&s;t e&s;ti|mates of things, and to prevent its pupils from being dazzled with the &s;plendor of wealth and power: it taught that the &s;ove|reign good was to be found in rectitude
<PB N="4" REF="022756_0008_0FBA5DF504D457E8">
of will. It would be a &s;hame for us to be at a lo&s;s on &s;uch an important &s;ubject, who have received le&s;&s;ons from a much better ma&s;ter than ever gave lectures in the &s;chools of Athens.</P>
<P>Re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that in the exerci&s;e of &s;ocial and religious duties, the mind will find her &s;olid happine&s;s. Wandering in re&s;t|le&s;s &s;earch, like Noah's dove, 'tis here &s;he finds at length the welcome olive, the branch who&s;e verdure blooms for immorta|lity. Should you doubt the a&s;&s;ertion, be prevailed on at lea&s;t to try the experiment.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>PLEASURE has &s;omething &s;o al|luring in the very name, that it is not &s;urprizing it finds &s;o great a number of votaries. On no account would I have you in&s;en&s;ible to its attractions, but rather lead you to its flowery paths, and conduct you to the mo&s;t refined delights. The&s;e how|ever you can never obtain, except you are guided in the choice by ta&s;te and judgment.
<PB N="5" REF="022756_0009_0FBA5DF72AECE440">
A ta&s;te in plea&s;ure is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;e|lection of &s;uch as are above the enquiries of the vulgar, &s;uitable to delicate and re|fined minds, and corre&s;pondent to the no|ble&s;t &s;entiments: of cour&s;e dependant more on intellectual, than on corporeal fa|culties. Ta&s;te never fails to reject whatever is gro&s;s and &s;en&s;ual; yet even among the more refined plea&s;ures, a found judgment is wanted, to di&s;criminate the &s;olid and rational, from the frivolous and fa&s;tidious. The elegant hand of fa&s;hionable di&s;&s;ipa|tion has often given a poli&s;h to what, in its own nature, can never de&s;erve the name of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Under this head mu&s;t be comprehended the various &s;pecies of fa&s;hionable amu&s;e|ments, which are injurious either to health or fortune. One would &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch pur&s;uits as the&s;e &s;hould ever be digni|fied with the name of plea&s;ure. Yet when numbers are daily &s;een hazarding, not only extravagant &s;ums, but peace of mind al&s;o, at the gaming-table.&mdash;When the or|der of nature is inverted, and the refre&s;h|ments of repo&s;e are bartered for midnight routs, we mu&s;t conclude that &s;uch valuable &s;acrifices are not made but with the ex|pectation
<PB N="6" REF="022756_0010_0FBA5DF7FABA6C80">
of &s;ome &s;upreme plea&s;ure to re|ward them: how &s;eldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rewards are found, can be&s;t be determined by the te&s;|timony of the di&s;&s;ipated and gay, who af|ter they have wa&s;ted the mo&s;t valuable ble&s;|&s;ings of life, as time, health, &s;pirits, &amp;c. will generally confe&s;s that they have never found the &s;atisfactions they &s;ought after.</P>
<P>To be able to dive&s;t real enjoyment from the fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es the world has put upon it, is a piece of wi&s;dom becoming a philo&s;o|pher; but it is a piece of wi&s;dom, you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ny dear girls, mu&s;t al&s;o acquire, if you expect to be happy. Fa&s;hion has arro|gated to it&s;elf the prerogative of fixing the criterion of plea&s;ure; but fa&s;hion is often a dangerous director, and is at be&s;t an imperfect one; for who has a power of effectually bia&s;&s;ing the natural di&s;po&s;ition of another: if therefore what is called amu&s;ement, be not agreeable to the real-turn of the mind, it cea&s;es to be viewed in that light, and can only be con&s;idered as an irk&s;ome conformity to the ta&s;tes of others.</P>
<P>Yet, abject as &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion undoubt|edly is, there are thou&s;ands who volunta|rily yield to it, who are content to live, move, and act, not as they like them&s;elves,
<PB N="7" REF="022756_0011_0FBA5DF98472A430">
but as the polite world thinks fit to dictate. I am no advocate for affected &s;ingularity in things merely indifferent; but when the idol fa&s;hion breaks in upon the rules of virtue (as it too often does) or the true enjoyment of life, this is &s;o mean a &s;lavery that a rational being might be expected to de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>
<P>When therefore rea&s;on and religion have given the clue to your plea&s;ures, re&s;olve always to have them of your own choo&s;ing, and not of other people's. The &s;anction of numbers is the cau&s;e that draws youth from virtue and happine&s;s: rea&s;on, when aided by a proper education, would if left to her&s;elf, point out the way to both.</P>
<P>There are plea&s;ures, my dear girls, to be met with in this journey of life, pure and &s;ublime ones too, if we look for them through the medium of unvitiated ta&s;te. Did you ever di&s;charge a &s;ocial duty, but upon looking into your heart, you there perceived a glow of &s;atisfaction? But if you aim at more exalted, more rapturous &s;en&s;ations, give full &s;cope to the impul&s;es of benevolence: try what it is to heal the broken-hearted: diffu&s;e joy through the man&s;ions of &s;orrow, and re&s;cue merit from
<PB N="8" REF="022756_0012_0FBA5DFAF3FFEB90">
the pre&s;&s;ure of indigence and misfortune.&mdash;The&s;e employments are capable of yield|ing plea&s;ures &s;uitable to the mo&s;t exalted capacities, boundle&s;s as the mo&s;t &s;anguine imagination can paint them.</P>
<P>But if &s;o va&s;t a multitude has erred in the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, through levity, not an incon&s;iderable number, of a very oppo&s;ite temper, are at equally as great a di&s;tance from it: the&s;e are the moro&s;e and cynical, who will not conde&s;cend to the &s;ober &s;atisfactions that are to be found in a dome&s;tic circle, where the &s;ocial affections are cultivated; if the gay and volatile mi&s;|take the nature of plea&s;ure, the&s;e &s;eem to que&s;tion its very exi&s;tence, and pa&s;s through life without &s;tooping to pick up one of the fair blo&s;&s;oms which nature has &s;catter|ed in the way.</P>
<P>Ever be your hearts open to the &s;weet emotions of &s;ocial love, and you will not have cau&s;e to complain that the path of hu|man life affords nothing but briars and thorns.</P>
<P>Nor is it from the relative duties alone we can derive happine&s;s: the amu&s;ing, the intere&s;ting book of nature is open to all who can read it: here you meet with eter|nal
<PB N="9" REF="022756_0013_0FBA5E00B1225A98">
variety, order, and beauty; a thou|&s;and charms await the mind which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a ta&s;te for &s;imple plea&s;ures; to &s;uch the whole creation is a boundle&s;s &s;ource of rational amu&s;ements. Happy, ineffably happy, they who can be plea&s;ed with art|le&s;s nature, and contemplate with delight, the noble imagery with which &s;he abounds. For my part, I &s;hould de&s;ire no greater proof of the purity and elegance of your ta&s;te, than to hear you &s;peak in raptures of the graceful foliage of a wood, the beauty of a lawn, or any of tho&s;e charm|ing rural &s;cenes which are &s;o often over|looked for the far le&s;s nobler productions of art.</P>
<P>E&s;teem me ever the mo&s;t affectionate of your friends.</P>

<P>EVERY one knows that human life is expo&s;ed to various mi&s;eries; but every one does not know, at lea&s;t does not con&s;ider, that the far greater part of the&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="022756_0014_0FBA5E0294783818">
mi&s;eries &s;pring from the pa&s;&s;ions: yet the pa&s;&s;ions, you reply, are implanted in us by nature&mdash;we cannot eradicate them.</P>
<P>That is true; you cannot eradicate the pa&s;&s;ions, nor is it expedient you &s;hould; for as we are the workman&s;hip of Infinite Wi&s;dom, &s;o doubtle&s;s the propen&s;ities He has formed us with, are in them&s;elves very good: but then their good or ill tendency mu&s;t be determined by this &s;ingle que&s;tion, Whether they govern us, or we govern them? In the latter ca&s;e they re&s;emble tho&s;e &s;alutary breezes, which waft health and &s;weetne&s;s on their wings: in the for|mer they may be compared to certain hur|ricanes, which tear up all before them, and deform the beauteous a&s;pect of the mo&s;t luxuriant climates. There is more felicity to be found in the world than is often &s;uppo&s;ed; but never let us pretend to look for it before we have &s;ilenced the pa&s;&s;ions, the perpetual contention we mu&s;t have with them will el&s;e interrupt our &s;ucce&s;sful &s;earch.</P>
<P>Pride, my dear girls, is a vice that &s;prings up in the mind, almo&s;t without her attend|ing to it: its character are an immode|rate &s;elf-love, conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ne&s;s, an arrogance,

with a profound contempt of every other per&s;on; ever in&s;atiable in its de&s;ire of re&s;pect, extremely &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;lighte&s;t af|fronts, and jealous of the lea&s;t tribute of applau&s;e paid to another. Per&s;ons of this ca&s;t cannot in the nature of things be hap|py, as they may be &s;aid to live in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility with all the world: like I&s;h|mael, they have their hands again&s;t every man, and every man's hand is again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Ambition condemns its wretched votary to forego the &s;weets of content and pre&s;ent ca&s;e, for the unea&s;y dreams of rank and and power. It is happy for the world, when fate denies to the ambitious that power to which their de&s;ires are perpetu|ally a&s;piring. Innumerable are the hor|rid deeds, which the hi&s;toric page records, that have been perpetrated by the impul&s;e of this re&s;tle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion; yet if in pity to mankind, its direful effects are re&s;trained, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ill the bo&s;om where it rages, mu&s;t be a prey to inexpre&s;&s;ible agonies.</P>
<P>Envy is a natural attendant on pride and ambition: it has very aptly been compar|ed to a vulture preying on the vitals, and there could not po&s;&s;ib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> have been devi&s;ed a more expre&s;&s;ive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">tude.

which is capable of regarding with the lea&s;t degree of regret, the more fortunate acquirements of another, has a perpetual &s;ource of di&s;quietude, and mu&s;t for ever pine beneath the inexpre&s;&s;ible mi&s;ery, which is both the con&s;equence and the pu|ni&s;hment of &s;o ba&s;e a propen&s;ity: as envy is the meane&s;t of all the pa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ions, &s;o in its own nature it is the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Covetou&s;ne&s;s is a vice that ab&s;orbs every finer feeling of the &s;oul. Whatever &s;ordid &s;atisfaction the mi&s;er may feel in ama&s;&s;ing his trea&s;ures, yet the cares which unavoid|ably attend it, and the &s;olicitude the pre|&s;ervation of it demands, more than ba|lance the &s;elfi&s;h gratification.&mdash;He knows nothing of the &s;weet emotions of charity and benevolence, and mu&s;t be ever a &s;tran|ger to the noble &s;en&s;ations they excite. It is well if the &s;ugge&s;tions of his boundle&s;s avarice do not prompt him beyond the bounds of integrity. The hone&s;ty of a covetous per&s;on can be but doubtful at the be&s;t.</P>
<P>A revengeful di&s;po&s;ition is as dreadful to &s;ociety as burden&s;ome to it&s;elf: it is the whirlwind of the &s;oul, which under its do|minion

re&s;embles a fury of the infernal regions. What &s;ad cata&s;trophes have been effected by revenge! what inexpre&s;&s;ible torment overwhelms the heart, where that dreadful venom operates!</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to perceive by the &s;lighte&s;t glance, that every one of the pa&s;&s;ions here enumerated are totally de&s;tructive of peace: there can be no &s;uch thing as tranquillity in the brea&s;t which they inhabit: let it then be the care of my deare&s;t girls, to guard again&s;t the fatal a&s;cendancy of either of them. There cannot be a more la|mentable object than a human being who &s;ubmits to become the &s;port of pa&s;&s;ions: a bark in a &s;torm driven by winds, and &s;hattered by the tempe&s;t, exhibits but a faint picture of &s;uch a wretch, who&s;e days pa&s;s in continual angui&s;h; he looks for peace, but finds de&s;pair; ca&s;ts oblique re|flections on the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of Providence; di&s;tru&s;ts his attributes; cur&s;es his own being, and dies if po&s;&s;ible more wretched than he lived.</P>

<P>Perhaps the natural pa&s;&s;ions of the hu|man mind may be reduced to two&mdash;the love of plea&s;ure and the love of prai&s;e, and from the corruptions of the&s;e may be traced every irregular affection of the heart&mdash;when men no longer knew the true &s;ource from whence to look for happine&s;s, or ap|probation, it is not much wonder it &s;hould be fought in power, riches, and pre-emi|nence; nor that the love of the&s;e &s;hould branch into &s;elf-love, vain glory, and all the other evil pa&s;&s;ions, which cau&s;e &s;o much mi&s;ery in the world.</P>
<P>The regulation of the heart and its de|&s;ires, is a point then of the utmo&s;t import|ance, &s;ince on it depends your pre&s;ent peace and eternal glory.

<P>The&s;e in&s;tances are fine illu&s;trations of the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, and eminently tend to exalt human nature to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible perfection.

we mu&s;t look for it; for the prime fruits of virtue grow not in the &s;oil that has ne|ver been broken up by moral in&s;truction. A virtuous and intelligent friend is per|haps the mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition a young per&s;on can make; but as one of this de&s;crip|tion may never fall to your lot, &s;upply the want thereof, as well as you can, by books.</P>
<P>By all means cultivate a ta&s;te for reading, but take care that your ta&s;te be a ju&s;t one&mdash;that is, be more de&s;irous of in&s;truction than amu&s;ement, or you will profit but little by literary pur&s;uits. Tho&s;e who read merely to plea&s;e the imagination, may be &s;ure of not reading to advantage, and do &s;eldom acquire a reli&s;h for works of &s;o|lid merit and utility. I have never known a young per&s;on who was fond of novels capable of reli&s;hing any thing &s;uperior to them. For my own part, I had rather &s;ee a girl wholly ignorant of the alphabet, than attached to that &s;pecies of writing; for I am convinced that infinitely more have erred in the conduct of life from that cau&s;e, than from any other. The &s;entiments and ideas they impre&s;s, are fatal illu&s;ions to mi&s;lead the poor reader, who, after wa&s;t|ing days and years in the &s;tudy, is &s;till an

It cannot be otherwi&s;e&mdash;for the &s;cenes, cha|racters, and incidents, the&s;e books de&s;cribe, are to be found no where but in the au|thor's romantic fancy. They have nothing to do with the real knowledge of the world; and, con&s;equently, tho&s;e who think to &s;teer through it by &s;uch guides, mu&s;t, in the end, find them&s;elves mi&s;taken. Ju&s;t as well may a traveller think to make the tour of Europe by a chart of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>If curio&s;ity mu&s;t be amu&s;ed, and the imagination plea&s;ed, why may not the under&s;tanding be improved at the &s;ame time? This is very practicable, for there are many works of genius extremely well calculated to an&s;wer each of the&s;e ends; but they are not the hi&s;tories of Sir &s;uch-a-one, Mi&s;s what d'ye call <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m, or any of tho&s;e futile productions, which the pre&s;s daily emits, to vitiate the ta&s;te, and cor|rupt the principles of the age.</P>

modern novels, under the &s;pecious ma&s;k of refined &s;entiments, introduce a dangerous &s;oftne&s;s that has often de&s;troyed both. True refinement is the glory of a rational creature, but whatever enervates the mind, mu&s;t deba&s;e it. Lycurgus thought &s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, when he bani&s;hed the poets from his commonwealth; yet &s;urely he lived near enough to Athens to have learned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> draw a proper line between ferocity and ef|feminacy.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion for novelty, &s;o inherent in youth, may be abundantly gratified, by the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory.

<P>It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be well ver&s;ed in the characters of the politer nations of antiquity, without catching &s;omething of that magnanimity which di&s;tingui&s;hed them; and I know not why an acquaintance with their manners &s;hould not be thought as ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the &s;y&s;tem of female education, as it u&s;ually is in that of the other &s;ex. If the Greek and Roman veterans di&s;played qualities which the heroes of the pre&s;ent day would be proud to imitate, their wives and daughters were often patterns of &s;uch virtues, as would be allowed to dignify a lady of the eighteenth century.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>AS long as curio&s;ity continues a lead|ing feature in the human character, biography will form a favourite &s;pecies of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ding. Every body is eager to pry into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> private character of a celebrated per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">age, and are better plea&s;ed to know, how &s;uch an one acts in dome&s;tic life, than in the &s;enate, or the field. And, indeed, it is there that the be&s;t e&s;timate of the real de&s;cription can be formed.</P>
<P>The private lives of famous per&s;ons afford much edification to the reader; the vice or meanne&s;s too often there di&s;played, teaches us not to be dazzled by the blaze of po|pularity or power; and to contemn that virtue which is built on the de&s;ire of fame alone. If on the other hand, by follow|ing the&s;e darlings of fame to the clo&s;et, or the fire-&s;ide&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;cover the &s;ame noblene&s;s of heart that di&s;tingui&s;hes them with the mul|titude, ju&s;tly they become patterns for our example; the mind rejoices to find &s;ome|thing about them that is <HI>imitable,</HI> for tho'
<PB N="25" REF="022756_0029_0FBA5E21F3F3E570">
few are called forth as di&s;tingui&s;hed actors on the theatre of the world, all may, if they plea&s;e, be <HI>great</HI> in private life; that is, may acquire tho&s;e amiable qualities of mind, which can only con&s;titute real great|ne&s;s; without which the hero is no more than a hypocrite, and even the robe of roy|alty, but a tin&s;el ornament to cover real meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>Your chief aim &s;hould be the knowledge of the human heart, and that is in general more fully di&s;covered in trifling traits and circum&s;tances, than by important actions performed under the public eye. But you no where find human nature &s;o impartially delineated, as in the &s;acred writings. There the hi&s;torians neither influenced by pa&s;&s;ion or prejudice, relate both actions and their &s;ecret &s;prings with unerring can|dour; never calumniating enemies, or &s;tooping to flatter the favourites of their nation.</P>
<P>The Jewi&s;h writers had the faire&s;t op|portunities imaginable for exaggerating the virtues of their heroes, con&s;idering the mi|raculous powers &s;o often exerted in their behalf. Such an adventure as that of Da|vid with Goliah, would have been thought
<PB N="26" REF="022756_0030_0FBA5E349E7D2D00">
by a pagan writer, &s;ufficient grounds for exalting his favourite to a God; yet the in&s;pired Biographer has drawn that Prince with all his frailties about him; all the in|equality of humanity; &s;ometimes glowing with the rapturous devotion of a Sera|phim;&mdash;at others, en&s;laved by the mean|e&s;t pa&s;&s;ions. Such in&s;tances of candour, con&s;idered with the national pride of the Jews, leave no room to doubt the vera|city of the &s;acred penman on any occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures al&s;o finely illu&s;trate many parts of profane hi&s;tory: we are told of embattled armies, and cities levelled with the du&s;t; but it is only in holy writ we find tho&s;e armies prophetically mar&s;halled, and that de&s;truction denounced perhaps an hundred years before the event. The&s;e are in&s;tances which impre&s;s the mind with reverence for the &s;acred records, and fill it with augu&s;t ideas of the eternal Provi|dence.</P>
<P>The works of our be&s;t morali&s;ts will not be unentertaining to you, if your ta&s;te for reading be as good as I wi&s;h it. Among&s;t the productions of this kind are the Spec|tator and the Rambler; as con&s;picuous for the elegance of their language, as the &s;oundne&s;s of their morality. But there
<PB N="27" REF="022756_0031_0FBA5E3588D7E2B0">
are no better rules for the moral conduct of life, than are found in the writings of Solomon, and the Son of Sirach; which, though compo&s;ed &s;o many ages ago, may yet be read to much advantage, by tho&s;e who would pa&s;s through life happily and re&s;pected.</P>
<P>If you are fond of poetry, be careful to read only what is good of it. There is a kind of ver&s;ification that tends to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> the mind;&mdash;wherever immorality or inde|licacy is found, &s;uch mu&s;t ever be the ef|fect. Elegance of numbers, though a re|qui&s;ite, is yet the lowe&s;t recommendation of good poetry;&mdash;its characteri&s;tics are dignity of thought, purity of expre&s;&s;ion, and, above all, the be&s;t principles of piety and morality. For this rea&s;on, tho&s;e poet|ical pieces extant in the Bible are by good judges allowed to be truly &s;ublime. Poe|try in its original &s;tate, being only the har|monious effu&s;ions of a mind glowing with elevated &s;entiments of genero&s;ity, gratitude and devotion. Many of the P&s;alms are no|ble compo&s;itions, and neither for beauty of figure, or energy of expre&s;&s;ion, have ever been excelled.</P>
<P>Natural hi&s;tory affords a delightful &s;tudy&mdash;it

<P>An acquaintance with the languages of polite nations greatly enlarges the mind.

Indolence takes hold of the di&s;po&s;ition much oftener than is acknowledged; it is po&s;&s;i|ble to be wholly under its dominion, and yet &s;u&s;pect nothing of it: and, what is yet more &s;trange, to believe one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;elf to be the mo&s;t diligent per&s;on in the world at the very time.

In &s;ome ca&s;es, poverty might ju&s;tly be called a ble&s;&s;ing. Great are the atchievements which re&s;olution and diligence can effect:&mdash;in nothing is their power more con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;een, than in the culti|vation of the mind: to reflect on the pro|gre&s;s of the human under&s;tanding&mdash;to com|pare the refinements of philo&s;ophy with a &s;tate of &s;avage nature&mdash;a Newton, with an inhabitant of New Holland&mdash;we &s;hould al|mo&s;t conclude &s;ome &s;upernatural power mu&s;t have contributed to give the former &s;o infinite a &s;uperiority in the &s;cale of beings. Without the quality I have recommended, it could never have been attained, for though much be owing to accidental ad|vantages, &s;uch as the being born in an enlightened kingdom affords, yet no incon|&s;iderable portion of diligence is required to render the&s;e advantages per&s;onally effec|tual.

<P>Do you think this an acqui&s;ition worth de&s;iring&mdash;then never forget that it can be obtained only by diligence and active in|du&s;try. Habits of indolence are de&s;truc|tive of every valuable attainment, and they are as much &s;o of happine&s;s, as they are known to be of virtue.</P>

<P>I have often thought that the great prevalence of vice ari&s;es chiefly from a culpable weakne&s;s of temper&mdash;for there is nothing &s;o amiable in it, that it &s;hould be followed for its own &s;ake. It is the mere want of re&s;olution that betrays &s;uch num|bers into the dreadful aby&s;s of &s;in and mi&s;ery.</P>

but the&s;e cannot be &s;upported with|out &s;ome portion of re&s;olution. There is a proper firmne&s;s, without which neither virtue, happine&s;s, or dignity of charac|ter, can be long maintained.

<P>In bu&s;ine&s;s, and the affairs of life, a proper firmne&s;s is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. Tho&s;e who can be influenced by every ad|vi&s;er or intimidated at every appearance of difficulty, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be de&s;ultory and un&s;ettled. They effect nothing of con&s;e|quence, becau&s;e they know not how to per&s;evere in any undertaking. Ob&s;tacles will attend the be&s;t concerted &s;chemes, and mankind will ever think differently

about them; but the truly wi&s;e will await with &s;teady patience the i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e mea&s;ures they have been careful to found in prudence and the moral fitne&s;s of things. Some will undertake nothing, till they &s;ee the path &s;mooth before them, and attain almo&s;t a certainly of &s;ucce&s;s. Such will find their lives wa&s;te, before they have deter|mined on the plan of it. Tho&s;e who be&s;t know the &s;tate of humanity, will be con|vinced, that to de&s;ign prudently and act firmly, is all that can be done by mortals.</P>
<P>Without re&s;olution, it will &s;ometimes be impo&s;&s;ible to act agreeably to the dic|tates of right rea&s;on, and virtue; for the&s;e are not always the <HI>ton;</HI> and when that is the ca&s;e, no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of forti|tude is requi&s;ite to repel the attacks of ri|dicule or amu&s;ement&mdash;nor can the trea&s;ures of knowledge be explored, without a por|tion of it&mdash;for "there is nothing truly va|luable to be attained without pains and labour." Di&s;mayed at the pro&s;pect, the indolent, as de&s;cribed by Solomon, cry, "a lio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is in the &s;treet."&mdash;Rather may my dear girls be animated with a noble ar|dour, to &s;urmount every difficulty which would retard their acqui&s;ition of merit and felicity.

rock, but then the Mu&s;es dwelt on its top.</P>
<P>But if re&s;olution be nece&s;&s;ary to the at|taining whatever is valuable or de&s;irable in life, it is no le&s;s &s;o to the &s;upporting us under a deprivation of it. The race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong&mdash;hence it follows, that the wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures do not always meet with &s;ucce&s;s, nor can virtue it&s;elf prevent the encroachments of affliction&mdash;in &s;uch circum&s;tances fortitude gives a dignity to &s;uffering, and tends al&s;o to alleviate the weight of it. Every one knows the &s;entiment of the Philo&s;opher&mdash;<Q>that a good man &s;truggling with adver|&s;ity, is a &s;ight on which the Gods them|&s;elves might look down with delight.</Q> However that be, it is certain that &s;uch a character never fails to command the re|&s;pect and veneration of mankind. Mag|nanimity, of all the qualities of the mind, &s;eems mo&s;t &s;ecure of admiration. The Saviour of the world inculcated it, when having forewarned his di&s;ciples of their ap|proaching &s;ufferings, he enjoined them to po&s;&s;e&s;s their &s;ouls in patience. Patience is among&s;t the Chri&s;tian duties, what mag|nanimity is in the li&s;t of heroic virtues. They are &s;ynonymous terms&mdash;both imply that calm, un&s;haken fortitude, which is at

once characteri&s;tic of the hero and the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But do not conclude this firmne&s;s of mind&mdash;this laudable re&s;olution, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> calculated only to be admired. It is of the highe&s;t actual &s;ervice to the unfortunate, not only by enabling them to &s;u&s;tain the burden of their &s;ufferings, but by opening a way to better pro&s;pects. The timid and irre&s;olute &s;ink, at the approach of adver&s;ity, into a de&s;pondency the mo&s;t unfriendly to their affairs, by precluding that courageous in|du&s;try which might render them more to|lerable; and therefore, by the nature of things, augment the very evils of which they complain.</P>
<P>Cultivate in all circum&s;tances this innate con&s;tancy&mdash;it will aid you in the attain|ment of every good and valuable end,&mdash;in pro&s;perity, will &s;ecure you from the cor|ruptions of vanity,&mdash;impart dignity and &s;erenity to adver&s;ity.

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>MY epi&s;tles to you, my dear girls, are written without the lea&s;t attention to method; their re&s;pective &s;ubjects have more the appearance of chance, than de|&s;ign; and therefore, may be ju&s;tly called cur&s;ory thoughts on various &s;ubjects. Young folks, I know, do not love preci&s;e rules, and perhaps you deem the irregularity of my letters their chief merit. Allow them, however, one more&mdash;that of &s;incerity: and believe that the &s;entiments they contain, flow from the heart; I believe, I need not add the word <HI>&s;pontaneou&s;ly.</HI></P>
<P>As I di&s;claim all methodical arrangement of my &s;ubjects, I will here give you my thoughts on that very important part of female &s;tudy, dre&s;s. Be not afraid that I am about to confine you to a primitive plainne&s;s, though probably, &s;uch a mode may be found more advantageous to beauty and elegance, than modern finery; yet I &s;hall recommend that which is at once agreeable to fa&s;hion, and your own rank and circum&s;tances. To reconcile the&s;e
<PB N="57" REF="022756_0061_0FBA5E6DC2D910A0">
three conditions, is no ea&s;y ta&s;k, yet herein lies a chief perfection of the female cha|racter; few women po&s;&s;e&s;s the happy art;&mdash;yet tho&s;e who do, mu&s;t be allowed a very &s;uperior degree of merit. It is no incon&s;i|derable trait in the character of an amiable young lady, that &s;he knows how to &s;upport a genteel appearance; and yet pay a ju&s;t regard to the frugality, which probably her limited circum&s;tances require.</P>
<P>A fanta&s;tical and expen&s;ive turn in dre&s;s, is the certain mark of a little mind; but that attention to it, which principally re|gards neatne&s;s, is undoubtedly extremely laudable. Re&s;olve to be always neat, or you can never be well-dre&s;&s;ed;&mdash;a dirty ruffle, a torn apron, &amp;c. are &s;ufficient to di&s;grace the mo&s;t &s;plendid apparel. Neat|ne&s;s is always within your power, and will always render you re&s;pectable in whatever rank of life you are placed; but finery, without it, is nothing more than a ridicu|lous glare, which is never &s;een but with di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Fa&s;hion has impo&s;ed &s;ome general rules, which may innocently be followed under the re&s;trictions I have mentioned. Your clothes may be made according to the mode, though the materials which compo&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="022756_0062_0FBA5E2B231F6CB0">
them, be le&s;s co&s;tly than if they belonged to a Dutche&s;s. An uncouth, ill-fa&s;hioned habit, derogates even from the importance of a philo&s;opher; and it is not till after a near acquaintance, that merit is di&s;covered through a &s;habby garment&mdash;&s;o much are mankind governed by appearance.</P>
<P>"Prithee good Xenocrates (&s;aid Plato to his pupil) &s;acrifice to the graces." That great man knew how much the mental ac|compli&s;hments might be illu&s;trated and adorned by a poli&s;hed exterior;&mdash;a wi&s;e per&s;on, it is true, would not make this al|together the criterion of merit, yet perhaps, would not readily look for worth beneath an ungraceful exterior.</P>
<P>After all, my dear girls, e&s;teem the fri|volous, though often trouble&s;ome arts of dre&s;s, but as a tax you are in &s;ome &s;ort obliged to pay to the folly of the age. Remember on all occa&s;ions, that external ornaments cannot make you better or hap|pier women. Great minds, however they may have judged it nece&s;&s;ary to conform to in&s;ignificant cu&s;toms, have always regarded them in their proper light. The attention &s;uch are &s;een to &s;how to the idol fa&s;hion, is only a good natured conde&s;cen&s;ion to the weakne&s;s of mankind, in points they judge of an indifferent nature, and much too tri|fling

<P>NEXT to our own principles, we are to regard tho&s;e of our companions; for they are almo&s;t of as much importance to us, as by long and intimate acquain|tance they generally become our own. Virtuous habits are &s;trengthened by ex|ample&mdash;&s;o are vicious ones, but in a much higher degree; nothing therefore can be a point of greater con&s;equence than the choice of companions.</P>
<P>A great deal has been written on the &s;ubject, and every one who has the care of youth, fails not to inculcate the keep|ing good company;&mdash;the only misfortune is, that the term has &s;eldom been &s;uffici|ently explained, and the young mind is left to annex to it the ideas of birth and fortune, till by degrees the expre&s;&s;ion is &s;uppo&s;ed to imply both the&s;e qualifications.</P>

<P>It is evident, that in this bu&s;tle, greater attention is paid to the accidental circum|&s;tances of rank and affluence, than to real merit; we &s;hould not el&s;e &s;o often &s;ee peo|ple of the middling rank, when flattered by the notice of a &s;uperior, &s;o elated with the honor of keeping, what they call good company; when perhaps, that &s;uperior is con&s;picuous for almo&s;t every vice and meanne&s;s. This is a grand mi&s;take &s;urely&mdash;as fatal to happine&s;s as to morals.</P>
<P>Good company can only mean per&s;ons of noble &s;entiments, refined manners, and enlightened under&s;tandings. But the&s;e qualities are not to be expected, where the &s;cantine&s;s of fortune has ab&s;olutely exclud|ed the means of education; for the human

It is therefore found, that in the lower ranks of &s;ociety, where poverty has denied time and abilities for that happy employ, the wor&s;t habits, and mo&s;t depraved morals prevail; for this rea&s;on you are not to choo&s;e companions from &s;uch a cla&s;s.</P>
<P>In fine, your a&s;&s;ociates mu&s;t be tho&s;e of a liberal and virtuous education.

<P>A cultivated mind is the proper &s;oil for every moral and &s;ocial virtue&mdash;it is mo&s;t likely to be found where Heaven has be|&s;towed an ea&s;y fortune, con&s;equently the genteeler ranks of life will be mo&s;t likely to afford you proper companions.

I &s;hould think you di&s;graced by an acquaintance with an empre&s;s, if &s;he was not as much di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by virtue as power.</P>
<P>Be careful not to form an acquaintance too ha&s;tily&mdash;many a virtuous girl has &s;unk for ever in the e&s;teem of the world, by being &s;een in company with tho&s;e of doubt|ful reputation.

She having admitted them to her &s;ociety, without the requi&s;ite inve&s;ti|gation of that point, infallibly renders her own prudence &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>A very exten&s;ive acquaintance is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ocial happine&s;s. A few &s;elect friends will mo&s;t conduce to that end; and it is among the&s;e, that

<P>Next to the character of a liar, that of the detractor is the mo&s;t odious&mdash;a habit of traducing the reputation of others, by &s;peaking all the ill we have heard of them, or putting the wor&s;t con&s;tructions on their actions, is totally oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, which breathes nothing but candour and charity.

<P>"HAIL politene&s;s, power divine!" &s;ays the &s;onnet, and &s;urely no unnece&s;&s;ary invocation; for politene&s;s, dear girls, is the friend of &s;ocial happine&s;s and dome&s;tic peace; if it was the fa&s;hion, in this age, to have hou&s;ehold gods, I would &s;urely give it a pre-eminent place among&s;t them.</P>
<P>I know not how it happens, but people &s;eem to think, they are obliged to be po|lite every where, but at home&mdash;and there it is they are mo&s;t required to be &s;o; for the refined &s;atisfactions of &s;ocial intercour&s;e cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it.

<P>But what is politene&s;s?&mdash;is it the law of fa&s;hion, or a &s;y&s;tem of rules?&mdash;No&mdash;it is the divine principle of benevolence, branch|ed into a thou&s;and little channels, and

flowing through all the minutiae of human life. Education may improve, but can ne|ver give it, for it mu&s;t be founded in the &s;oul, or is never &s;een in full perfection. A painter may learn the rules of de&s;ign, and the compendium of colours; but if he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es not the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the art, his pictures will be lifele&s;s and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>Politene&s;s is that amiable di&s;po&s;ition, which delights in the happine&s;s of others&mdash;con&s;ults their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e&mdash;prevents their wants&mdash;and yields them every po&s;&s;ible convenience. This is the &s;ource of tho&s;e civilities and at|tentions, which di&s;tingui&s;h a well bred per|&s;on&mdash;without it, etiquette dwindles to un|meaning ceremony.</P>
<P>You perceive then, that not only an at|tention to external graces, but a regulation of the di&s;po&s;ition is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a polite per&s;on.

<P>NOTHING is more talked of than religion&mdash;nothing le&s;s under&s;tood. Without comprehending what it really is, the &s;pirit of bigotry would arrogate the
<PB N="72" REF="022756_0076_0FBA5E81F707E018">

<P>I have ju&s;ter notions of religion&mdash;&s;ee it as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s&mdash;not a mode of ceremonies, but a divine principle influencing the whole moral conduct; its &s;imple, fixed and determinate &s;en&s;e, is briefly love of God, and good will to mankind. This, dear girls, is the &s;um of all religion; without it, vain were the oblations of the Jewi&s;h church&mdash;vain are the ceremonials of the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The "love of God," is an expre&s;&s;ion, that of late years has been as gro&s;sly abu&s;|ed, as the word religion. Strange as it may appear, there have been tho&s;e, who leading the mo&s;t immoral lives, have &s;tyled them&s;elves lovers of the God of purity&mdash;who&s;e tongues could utter a pious ejacula|tion, while their hands were committing the mo&s;t flagitious crimes. But be not deceived&mdash;this exalted character belongs neither to bigotry nor enthu&s;ia&s;m. The love of God is not a pa&s;&s;ion, but a rational principle; it is tho&s;e &s;entiments of reverence and gra|titude, which naturally ari&s;e in a generous mind&punc; when reflecting on one &s;upreme bene|ficent power, who is the immediate author of all good, and the fountain of all per|fection. This conviction is the parent of
<PB N="73" REF="022756_0077_0FBA5E83802ECC78">
unaffected piety; the &s;oul cannot but adore the Being &s;he believes to be all wi&s;e, all mighty, and eternal;&mdash;&s;he cannot but love him who is the &s;ource of unnumbered ble&s;&s;ings;&mdash;nor choo&s;e, but dread to offend him who&s;e nature &s;he believes to be holine&s;s. Hence the &s;ource of moral virtue&mdash;&s;in is avoided, becau&s;e di&s;plea&s;ing to the will of the Deity; and virtuous are di&s;po&s;itions are acquired, becau&s;e agreeable to a power who is able to reward every endeavour to plea&s;e him, with eternal and un&s;peakable happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Such a filial rational lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, mu&s;t be the fruit of every mind that is not ignorant of the be|ing and attributes of God;&mdash;or that has not received from bigotry or &s;uper&s;tition, any mi&s;taken notions of him. To prevent be|ing di&s;turbed by the &s;piritual pride of hy|pocritical fanatics, remember there is an invariable te&s;t by which you may know if you have the love of God. A&s;k your own heart, if it &s;eeks the favour of the Deity above every other con&s;ideration? if it va|lues this more than its deare&s;t intere&s;ts, and even life it&s;elf, a ready affirmative puts the que&s;tion out of all doubt.</P>
<P>I have been always of opinion, that re|ligion owes the abu&s;es that have been put

on her, more to the weakne&s;s than the knavery of mankind; perhaps it would be no hard ta&s;k to prove, that all the ab&s;urd doctrines which at this day di&s;grace her in certain &s;ects, originated with per&s;ons, the warmth of who&s;e imagination exceeded the &s;trength of their under&s;tanding; but waving whatever tends to controver&s;y, I &s;hall only hint that the practice of piety has received con&s;iderable injury by devotees of the above-mentioned cla&s;s. Forgetful of what was ju&s;t now advanced, that reli|gion is not a pa&s;&s;ion, but a principle, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e people have made it all con&s;i&s;t in incoherent rhap&s;odies, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s jargon of devout impul&s;es&mdash;holy con&s;olations, and &s;uch like, which I believe they are more indebted for to particular tempers and con&s;titutions than any revolution of divine favour. Per|&s;ons of &s;olid &s;en&s;e, have with rea&s;on been di&s;gu&s;ted at this affected piety&mdash;but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> world loves to run into extremes, and therefore it happens, that becau&s;e the cant of hypocri&s;y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, has been judg|ed injurious to the dignity of religion&mdash;modern manners di&s;claim any acquaintance with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P>But be a&s;&s;ured, my dear girls, that no|thing &s;o highly elevates and adorns the hu|man

character, as a &s;teady rational piety&mdash;nor is any thing capable of yielding &s;o pure and exalted a happine&s;s to the &s;oul, as an habit of devotion. No one who has expe|rienced the vici&s;&s;itude of &s;ublunary things, but mu&s;t highly value the privilege of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing a friend that would at all times be acceptable&mdash;ready to hear the complaints of affliction, and all powerful to relieve them.</P>
<P>Such a friend you may enjoy in the Di|vine Being; of what con&s;equence is it then that you acquire a ta&s;te for the exerci&s;es of devotion;&mdash;that you cultivate a friend&s;hip with Heaven, and accu&s;tom your hearts to to talk with God! This is an emphatical expre&s;&s;ion of David, and gives you an idea of rational and &s;incere prayer&mdash;which con|&s;i&s;ts not in formal addre&s;&s;es, but is the genuine language of the heart. Such a divine intima|cy, has &s;omething in it extremely &s;uitable to the noble&s;t &s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul; and therefore may well be &s;ought after as a &s;ource of refined and exqui&s;ite felicity.

That grand que&s;tion which has &s;ince agitated the &s;chools of philo&s;ophy, of what was the chief good of man, was all apparent to the fir&s;t of the human race:&mdash;he &s;aw perfectly clear, that it con&s;i&s;ted in the entire a&s;&s;imilation of his will to that of the Deity&mdash;and in the pur|&s;uit found a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll unmixed felicity.

<P>Adam continued a happy being as long as his will remained con&s;onant to that of his Maker; but at the in&s;tant it deviated therefrom, her fell from happine&s;s and per|fection. The conci&s;ene&s;s of the &s;cripture hi&s;tory, leaves unthinking minds in doubt as to the nature of Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but undoubtedly it originated in the mere de&s;ire of doing contrary to the divine com|mand;&mdash;he forgot that the Deity was his happine&s;s, and he &s;ought it in his own will. It was herein he &s;inned, and not &s;imply by eating the forbidden fruit, for at the very moment Adam be|came capable of imagining there might be

<P>The Creator &s;aw at one comprehen&s;ive view, the mi&s;eries which would accrue to mankind, from the voluntary perver&s;ion of the intellectual and moral powers;&mdash;then was the &s;cheme of Chri&s;tianity devi&s;ed, as an effectual means of re&s;toring human na|ture to the happine&s;s and perfection it ori|ginally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.&mdash;The purpo&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing was graciou&s;ly announced in that prediction, that the po&s;terity of Eve &s;hould cru&s;h the &s;erpent's head.</P>
<P>The human rea&s;on thus clouded, it is al|mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing to reflect by what rapid &s;teps the world bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me immer&s;ed in the wor&s;t of ignorance and vice.

ordain him the father of a nation; who being by numerous and peculiar laws, &s;e|parated from the re&s;t of the world, might pre&s;erve, uncorrupt the knowledge of the Divine Nature. The Bible will convince you how ineffectual, not only the&s;e laws, but the frequent and &s;ignal manife&s;tations of Almighty Power were to &s;ecure that people from the gro&s;&s;e&s;t idolatry, the rites of which were now become &s;o terrible to the imagination, that they even burnt their children alive, in &s;acrifices to their horrid idols.</P>

<P>The Egyptians were very early e&s;teem|ed for learning, laws and arts&mdash;they were a numerous, powerful, and wealthy people, but &s;o gro&s;sly idolatrous, that they not only wor&s;hipped images, but bea&s;ts, in|&s;ects, and even vegetables.

Babylon, that mighty &s;eat of empire, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t other nations in the &s;uperb materials of her Gods. A&s;tronomers there ob&s;erved the motions of the Heavens, and bowed in adoration to the &s;plendid ho&s;ts that adorned them. Cyrus, who erected the Per&s;ian on the ruins of the Babyloni&s;h Monarchy, knew nothing of the Almighty Being, who named him, an age before he had exi&s;tence, as the in&s;trument of liberty to his captive people. Alexander, who in his turn &s;ubverted this exten&s;ive empire, could only blend his Grecian idols with the Per&s;ian&mdash;for dark, deplorably dark, was every corner of the habitable earth, except the incon&s;iderable land of Judea, where only a few de&s;pi&s;ed, enfeebled tribes, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the light of &s;acred knowledge.</P>
<P>What a &s;pectacle for the Father of the Univer&s;e! who produced a world to know him and be happy! How much mu&s;t his divine compa&s;&s;ion be excited, on contem|plating his glorious work in ruins!&mdash;to re|deem it was an effort worthy of him&s;elf.</P>

Every pa&s;&s;ion of the human mind was per&s;onified, and deified; &s;tatues gra|ced every corner of their &s;treets.

were no longer compelled to enquire "Where is God our Maker?" They knew him, and were in&s;tructed in his divine wor|&s;hip.

<P>Support with decency every provocation, that ill breeding and avarice may give you at play; but you will merit a repetition of that behaviour, if you ever play again with &s;uch per&s;ons; the one is maintaining, the other will be le&s;&s;ening, your dignity.</P>
