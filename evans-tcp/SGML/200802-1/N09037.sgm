<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT to the READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Publi&s;her of the following Di&s;cour&s;e, being only an accidental Auditor, when it was delivered, and entirely unknown to the Author, would not have taken the Liberty to publi&s;h it without her Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, if he had had either an Op|portunity of a&s;king it, or a Doubt, in Ca&s;e he had a&s;ked it, that it would have been refu&s;ed: But being fully per&s;uaded that the &s;ame Spirit of Piety and Benevolence, by which the Words were conceived and uttered, for the Benefit of the Hearers, would have induced the Preacher, if &s;he had been applied to, to con&s;ent to the Publication, and thereby make the Benefit more exten&s;ive: he therefore concludes, &s;he will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with, but rather approve of, the Publication of her Di&s;cour&s;e; e&s;pecially as, if the Publi&s;her may judge of others by him&s;elf, it will have the &s;ame good Effect upon the Readers, that &s;he intended it &s;hould have upon the Hearers, when &s;he delivered it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Publi&s;her may, by &s;ome, be though blamable for thus expo&s;ing an extempore Di&s;cour&s;e, delivered without Notes, or any Regard to grammatical Niceties of Expre&s;&s;ion; but I doubt not, the Reader will be kind enough to excu&s;e any little Impro|prieties he may di&s;cover of this Sort, tho' I confe&s;s, if there are any that need an Apology, they have e&s;caped my Notice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Language is indeed plain, and the Words, &s;uch as are in common U&s;e, intelligible to the meane&s;t Capacity; but in my O|pinion, the mo&s;t common Words, that clearly expre&s;s our Mean|ing, are the be&s;t, and it was their being &s;o, that made them the mo&s;t common. The Sentiments in the following Di&s;cour&s;e, are ju&s;t and important; the Language expre&s;&s;es tho&s;e Sentiments, with Clearne&s;s, Strength, and Solemnity; and as they &s;eem to flow with Sincerity and Warmth from the Heart, will be likely to reach the Heart; for &s;he practically &s;eems to have improved the following Lines of Advice to a Preacher,</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;'Tis not enough that what you &s;ay is true,</L>
<L>To make us feel it, you mu&s;t feel it too;</L>
<L>Shew your &s;elf warm'd, and that will Warmth impart,</L>

<P>THE &s;oul that has its thoughts fix'd upon God,&mdash;firmly relying upon God for help, upon its Maker for protection and countenance, thro' all the changes of this mortal life, is cer|tainly happy beyond any finite comprehen&s;ion. The divine image, when grafted in the &s;oul, ut|terly excludes all vain and o&s;tentatious thoughts of our own &s;ufficiency; a confidence in which would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a Chri&s;tian, as well as repugnant to the expre&s;s command of God, given to the prophet, <HI>to de|ba&s;e the creature, and exalt the Creator.</HI></P>

<P>And further, friends! don't let us entertain wrong notions of God; that is, don't let us con|&s;ider him in his attribute of ju&s;tice only, nor his darling one, that of mercy; but let us con&s;ider him as a God, who him&s;elf hath &s;aid, <Q>I will vi|&s;it the iniquities of the fathers upon the chil|dren, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and will &s;hew mercy unto thou&s;ands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</Q> There are too many, now a days, who forget the plain parts of &s;cripture, (of which there are enough for every man to pro|fit withal) and from a want of under&s;tanding the more ob&s;cure ones, are too apt to think irreve|rently of the Deity, and &s;o grow entirely negli|gent with re&s;pect to the great work of their &s;alva|tion.&mdash;But, my friends, the word of God is plain to every man who has the light of rea&s;on, <Q>that without holine&s;s, no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord;</Q> this is the foundation of all religion. Surely no one need be at a &s;tand how to act with re&s;pect to God, his neighbour and him&s;elf. God has promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to all who en|deavour to &s;erve him; and &s;urely there can be no difficulty in under&s;tanding this.

<P>But, when on the other hand, we con&s;ider, <Q>that unto whom&s;oever much is given, of him &s;hall much be required;</Q> we are too apt to infer from thence, that unto whom&s;oever little is given, of him &s;hall little be required; and &s;o conclude, that all our imperfections, of what kind &s;oever, are well &s;ecured; and &s;o we think, who|ever errs, be it for want of under&s;tanding, or the outward means of knowledge, or through pa&s;&s;ion and prejudices, that &s;uch want the light, and are to be con&s;idered as tho&s;e to whom little is given. I &s;ay, my friends, this is one way the lukewarm have to lull their con&s;ciences to &s;leep, as it were: But &s;till con&s;cience returns, and proves that they have had the light, in many in&s;tances in which they have been great offenders.&mdash;Surely, the &s;tate of &s;uch people plainly an&s;wers to our Lord's likening the kingdom of <Q>Heaven to a man's travelling into a far country, who called his own &s;ervants, and delivered unto them his goods: And to one he gave five talents, to a|nother two, and to another one, to every man according to his particular ability, and &s;traight|way took his journey. Then he that had re|ceived the five talents, went and traded with the &s;ame, and by a prudent management made them other five talents. And he that had re|ceived two, gained al&s;o other two. But he that received one, went and hid his Lord's ta|lent.
<PB N="15" REF="011535_0008_0F87262B8F8DEB18">
And when their Lord came to reckon with them, he that had received five talents, came and &s;aid, Lord thou delivered&s;t unto me five talents; behold I have gained be&s;ide them five talents more.

Oh friends! the day is coming, when all that is on the earth &s;hall be as &s;tubble: Then the &s;coffers, who mock at &s;in, and make their game of the &s;erious and devout;&mdash;tho&s;e, who, in&s;tead of giving all diligence to make their calling and election &s;ure, have trampled upon the frequent admonitions given them to a better life; will wi&s;h they had employed their time to a bet|ter purpo&s;e.&mdash;But it will be too late!&mdash;For when once the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e has &s;hut to the door, in vain we &s;hall &s;tand without and knock.

'to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t;' for as he &s;aith him&s;elf. <Q>what man of you, having an hundred &s;heep, if he lo&s;e one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderne&s;s, and go after that which is lo&s;t, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his &s;houlders, rejoicing.

Oh&punc; then, <Q>let the wicked for&s;ake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon him.</Q></P>
<P>The very end and de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's coming, was to aboli&s;h &s;in, and bring in a new and com|plete &s;atisfaction, a new and &s;ufficient righteou&s;|ne&s;s; which he did, by offering him&s;elf a ran&s;om for &s;inners, and &s;uffering in their &s;tead, <Q>that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</Q></P>
<P>O! that there was, from this moment, <Q>a death unto &s;in, and a new life unto righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q>&mdash;Finally, my brethren, &s;ince Chri&s;t Je&s;us has &s;tood in the place of &s;inners, <Q>has become &s;in for us, who knew no &s;in, that we may be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him&punc;</Q> Then let there

be, from this moment, <Q>a death unto &s;in, and a new life unto righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q> Let us li&s;ten to the apo&s;tle's admonition. <Q>Walk not in cham|bering and wantonne&s;s, in &s;trife and envying, but put ye on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and make not provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof.</Q> God has given us appetites, and made it part of our trial to govern and re&s;train them within their proper channels; and to in|dulge the&s;e appetites beyond mea&s;ure, wou'd be the highe&s;t ingratitude to our heavenly benefac|tor. Let us look to the glory and immortality which is placed before us, the everla&s;ting man&s;i|ons, prepared for tho&s;e who &s;erve their ma&s;ter in holine&s;s and newne&s;s of life, and keep them&s;elves un&s;potted from the world: Then, let us view the va&s;t variety of temptations which are &s;o apt to fix us down to this world, and interrupt all our hopes of a better.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations, what more power|ful arguments can there be imagined, to prevail with us, to ab&s;tain from fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, than this; that <Q>we are &s;trangers and pilgrims on earth, and look for another, even an Heavenly habitation, who&s;e builder and maker is God.</Q> Let us then in&s;tantly bid adieu to all unlawful, worldly de|lights, which are &s;o apt to en&s;lave and captivate the heart of man. Let us in&s;tantly &s;et about the great work of our &s;alvation, while it is day, that is, while we have the ble&s;&s;ed opportunity. Let us &s;ay, with the apo&s;tle, <Q>The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</Q> Let us in|&s;tantly beg of God, to <Q>lead us into the way, the truth and the light.</Q> Oh! that his holy

The &s;crip|ture &s;aith, <Q>It is God that worketh in us both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure.</Q> The a|po&s;tle po&s;itively renounceth all &s;ufficiency of his own, he will have no merit imputed to the crea|ture; 'not I,' &s;aith he, <Q>but Chri&s;t that dwell|eth in me.</Q> All human accompli&s;hments are no more than dro&s;s or dung, when compared to the excellency of the knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>If there was really a thorough change in our natures; if there was really a longing, an earne&s;t longing after God, what univer&s;al charity wou'd then abound among all ranks of people? Mi|ni&s;ters wou'd have that care and &s;incere love for their flock, as knowing that one day they mu&s;t give an account. In &s;hort, my friends, were we to con&s;ider the great and almighty Being, as he really is, the Alpha and Omega, the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t! I &s;ay, my friends, were we to make this God our <Q>God, the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t of each day's thought; what manner of per&s;ons &s;hould we then be in all holy conver&s;ation and godli|ne&s;s?</Q> Our lives would be &s;uch as would be|&s;peak us <Q>a peculiar, cho&s;en people, zealous of good works.</Q></P>
<P>The day is ha&s;tening, when all that we &s;ee now, will be no more! Then let us &s;ecure to our&s;elves an everla&s;ting inheritance; and inheri|tance among the fir&s;t born, who&s;e names are written in Heaven.</P>
<P>The day is ha&s;tening, when that awful doom will take place,&mdash;<Q>He that is holy, let him be holy &s;till, and he that is filthy, let him be fil|thy &s;till!</Q> This is an alarming thought, and well de&s;erves our attention.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="011535_0011_0F87262E9FEF7DC8">
Methinks I am concerned to &s;peak it again and again in your ears, that you all earne&s;tly attend to the one thing needful; that you pre&s;s forward towards the mark of the 'prize of our high-calling in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.' It will not do to be lukewarm, to be li&s;tle&s;s and carele&s;s in an affair of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, and e&s;pecially &s;ince we know, <Q>It is appointed unto all men once to die.</Q></P>
<P>Methinks it argues a depravity of under&s;tanding, as well as the greate&s;t impiety, to make no provi&s;ion for another world, whither we are all ha&s;tening.</P>
<P>Here is no abiding place.&mdash;Give all diligence, I be&s;eech you, to &s;ecure to your&s;elves an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, before that day come, when proclamation will be made, <HI><Q>That time &s;hall be no more.</Q></HI> <Q>All fle&s;h is gra&s;s, and all the goodli|ne&s;s thereof as the flower of the field. The gra&s;s wi|thereth, and the flower fadeth, but the word of the Lord endureth forever.</Q> This was the prophet's declaration. Every thing relating to human life will cea&s;e, the world it|&s;elf will come to an end.</P>
<P>Be wi&s;e then betimes, le&s;t that day come upon you when you think not, and in an hour when ye are not aware: O! 'buy the truth, and &s;ell it not;' like the merchant our Lord &s;peaks of, <Q>who when he had found the co&s;tly pearl, the pearl of great price, he immediately &s;old all that he had,</Q> (he denied him&s;elf of every gratification that might otherwi&s;e divert his thoughts from that which was his chief|e&s;t good) that he might purcha&s;e that field where the inva|luable pearl lay.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t men live as though they were never to die.</P>
<P>There is either a total neglect, or a general carele&s;ne&s;s, with regard to &s;piritual things, in every thing they do; but this is certainly bad,&mdash;'tis &s;hocking to the la&s;t degree, to live regardle&s;s of futurity; to live thus unmindful of that being who has &s;et a day in the which he will judge the world! A tribunal, at which every created being mu&s;t ap|pear, there to an&s;wer for the deeds done in the body! And, my friends, I will a&s;k you this plain que&s;tion: Is not this a matter that well de&s;erves our attention? Is it not a con|&s;ideration &s;ufficient, of it&s;elf, to draw off our attention from the vain and trifling amu&s;ements of this tran&s;itory life, and engage our&s;elves in the pur&s;uit of the one thing needful, the pearl of great price, which will vi&s;ibly carry it's own re|ward along with it? The grave is the land where all things
<PB N="22" REF="011535_0012_0F87262F4D69A3B8">
(of temporal concernment) are forgotten: Let us give all diligence to have our lamps trimmed, that if &s;ickne&s;s &s;hould attack us, and death &s;tare us in the face, we may &s;ay, with re&s;ignation, cheerfulne&s;s and triumph, <Q>O death! where is thy &s;ting? O grave! where is thy victory? All fle&s;h is gra&s;s, and all the goodline&s;s thereof as the flower of the field, the gra&s;s withereth, and the flower fadeth, but the word of the Lord endureth forever.</Q></P>
<P>Eternity is at hand, <Q>behold he that cometh, will come; and will not tarry.</Q> Let our lives be &s;uch, that when our Lord comes to reckon with us, we may be able to render him a ju&s;t and true account. And indeed by conducting our&s;elves in the path of religion and virtue, and where on|ly true joy is to be found, our lives will be influential of the lives of others: Example is better than precept, it would &s;peak to them thus, 'you follow us, as we follow God.'</P>
<P>O that mini&s;ters might have a watchful care over their flocks! O, that their lives may be a tran&s;cript and pattern of what they teach. Finally, my brethren, let me advi&s;e you to live as becometh chri&s;tians: There would be that harmony, that content and &s;atisfaction, that the world's ap|plau&s;e cannot give, nor it's cen&s;ure take away.</P>
<P>God has promi&s;ed his peace to all who &s;eek it: It is a peace which far &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all human under&s;tanding. <Q>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you</Q></P>
<P>But then, my dear friends, we can never expect this peace, if we live in a cour&s;e of wickedne&s;s; for, <Q>there is no peace, &s;aith my God, to the wicked:</Q> <Q>He that ho|noureth me, I will honour, and he that de&s;pi&s;eth me &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed.</Q> Neither mu&s;t we content our&s;elves with thinking that by thus departing from the mo&s;t enor|mous crimes, God will be thus &s;atisfied. No, this is a mi&s;|taken notion: God is not to be mocked; he &s;aith, <Q>My &s;on, give me thine heart.</Q></P>
<P>There mu&s;t be an utter de&s;truction of Amaleck, or God is not &s;atisfied, it is not doing our duty in part, that will avail us; we mu&s;t give up every thing, every darling &s;in, that mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets us. <Q>That for the fire to the fire, and that for the hammer to the hammer. God is of pu|rer eyes than to behold iniquity.</Q> He will not dwell in an unclean temple. Let us narrowly in&s;pect into our ways,

and &s;crutinize into our own hearts, and &s;ee if every thing be right within; and if &s;o, it will be readily manife&s;ted by our lives and conver&s;ations. Oh! my friend, whoever thou art, that is within the audience of my voice, let me intreat thee to make God thy friend; for, after death, comes the judgment,&mdash;on each of us! I would al&s;o, that mini&s;ters give all diligence in their callings, for if we fall, we fall not alone. <Q>Cry aloud, and &s;pare not; tell my people their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and the hou&s;e of Jacob their &s;ins.</Q>&mdash;Our bu&s;ine&s;s (as preachers) is to preach repentance to all, without re&s;pect to per&s;ons, <Q>whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</Q> If we act counter to this, if we, for fear of it's hurting our temporal concerns, ne|glect to preach with that plainne&s;s that ought ever to di&s;|tingui&s;h a go&s;pel mini&s;ter,&mdash;Let me tell thee, whoever thou art, that neglecte&s;t to &s;trike at the root of &s;in, and do&s;t thy duty but in part, thou wilt receive Saul's condemna|tion; who, notwith&s;tanding his expre&s;s order from God, was to make an utter de&s;truction of Amaleck, yet &s;pared what was be&s;t, agreeable to his own fond inclination: we read, he &s;aved the be&s;t of the &s;heep and oxen, and Agag.</P>
<P>But, however merciful this may appear, in Saul's &s;par|ing Agag, his fooli&s;h pity and compa&s;&s;ion to the captive king, was ill timed, when God's will was otherwi&s;e. I don't want to go through with every proof that could be brought in &s;upport of what I have been endeavouring to enforce: Let us only act agreeable to the will and plea&s;ure of our maker, and what he orders to be done, to do it with cheerfulne&s;s and alacrity as unto a faithful Creator. I can &s;ay truly, that he who th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s approves him&s;elf, is worthy of all honour. Finally, my brethren, let us in&s;tantly &s;acrifice every darling &s;in that may &s;eem to &s;tand in our way to glo|ry.
