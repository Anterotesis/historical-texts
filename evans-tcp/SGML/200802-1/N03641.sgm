<P>THESE Words contain the Holy Re&s;olution of pious <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> who having in a mo&s;t mo|ving, affectionate Di&s;cour&s;e recounted to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> what great Things GOD had done for them, in the Ver&s;e immediately foregoing the Text, comes to draw a proper Inference from what He had been delivering; and acquaints them, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Terms, that &s;ince GOD had been &s;o exceeding Gra|cious unto them, they could do no le&s;s than, out of Gratitude for &s;uch uncommon Favours and Mercies dedicate both them&s;elves and Families to his Service. <HI>Now therefore,</HI> &s;ays he, Ver&s;e 14. <HI>Fear the Lord, and &s;erve him in Sincerity and Truth, and put away the Gods which your Fathers &s;erved on the other Side of the Flood.</HI> And by the &s;ame engaging Motives does the Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI> afterwards enforce their Obedience to the Com|mandments
<PB N="6" REF="004450_0004_100D9DF95D18DA40">
of GOD, I <HI>Sam.</HI> xii. 24. <HI>Only fear the LORD, and &s;erve him in Truth, with all your Heart: For con&s;ider</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>how great Things. He hath done for you.</HI> But then, that they might not excu&s;e them|&s;elves (as too many might be apt to do) by his giving them a bad Example, or think he was laying heavy Burdens upon them, whil&s;t he him&s;elf touched them not with one of his Fingers, he tells them in the Ver&s;e out of which the Text is taken, that whatever Regard they might pay to the Doctrine he had been Preach|ing, yet He (as all Mini&s;ters ought to do) was re|&s;olved to live up to and Practice it him&s;elf; <HI>Chu&s;e you</HI> therefore, &s;ays he, <HI>whom you will &s;erve, whether the Gods which your Fathers &s;erved, or the Gods of the Amorites in who&s;e Land ye dwell: But as for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>A Re&s;olution this worthy of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and no le&s;s becoming, no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for every true Son of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> that is intru&s;ted with the Care and Government of a Family in our Day: And, if it was ever &s;ea&s;ona|ble for Mini&s;ters to preach up, or People to put in Practice Family Religion, it was never more &s;o than in the pre&s;ent Age; &s;ince it is greatly to be feared, that out of tho&s;e many Hou&s;holds that call them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> there are but few that &s;erve GOD in their re&s;pective Families as they ought.</P>
<P>IT is true indeed, vi&s;it our Churches, and you may perhaps &s;ee &s;omething of the <HI>Form of Godline&s;s</HI> &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among us; but even <HI>that</HI> is &s;carcely to be met with in private Hou&s;es. So that were the Ble&s;&s;ed Angels to come, as in the Patriarchal Age, and ob|&s;erve our Spiritual OEconomy at Home, would they not be tempted to &s;ay, as <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Abime|lech,
<PB N="7" REF="004450_0005_100D9DFAEF05E338">
Surely the Fear of GOD is not in this Place?</HI> Gen. XX. II.</P>
<P>How &s;uch a general Neglect of <HI>Family Religion</HI> fir&s;t began to over-&s;pread the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> World, is difficult to determine. As for the Primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> I am po&s;itive it was not &s;o with them: No, they had not &s;o learned CHRIST, as fal&s;ely to imagine Religion was to be confined &s;olely to their A&s;&s;emblies for Pub|lick Wor&s;hip; but on the contrary behaved with &s;uch Piety and exemplary Holine&s;s in their private Fami|lies, that Saint <HI>Paul</HI> often &s;tyles their Hou&s;e a Church: <HI>Salute &s;uch a one,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and the Church which is in his Hou&s;e.</HI> And, I believe, we mu&s;t for ever de&s;pair of &s;eeing a Primitive Spirit of Piety, revived in the World, till we are &s;o happy as to &s;ee a Revival of Primitive Family Religion; and Per&s;ons unanimou&s;ly re&s;olving with Good Old <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> in the Words of the Text.&mdash;<HI>As for Me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>FROM which Words I &s;hall beg Leave to in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e three Things:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That it is the Duty of every Governour of a Family to take care, that not only He him&s;elf, but al&s;o that tho&s;e committed to his Charge <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew after what Manner a Governour and his Hou&s;hold ought to <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>Thirdly</HI> and la&s;tly, I &s;hall offer &s;ome Motives in order to excite all Governours, with their re&s;pective
<PB N="8" REF="004450_0006_100D9DFCD598EA58">
Hou&s;holds, to <HI>&s;erve the LORD</HI> in the Manner that &s;hall be recommended.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. AND <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to &s;hew that it is the Duty of every Governour of a Family to take care, that not only He him&s;elf, but al&s;o that tho&s;e committed to his Charge &s;hould <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>AND this will appear, if we con&s;ider that every Governour of a Family ought to look upon him&s;elf as obliged to act in three Capacities; as a Prophet, to in&s;truct; as a Prie&s;t to pray for and with; as a King to govern, direct, and provide for them. It is true indeed the latter of the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> their Kingly Office, they are not &s;o frequently deficient in, (nay in this they are generally too &s;ollicitous;) but as for the two former, <HI>viz.</HI> their Prie&s;tly and Prophetick Offices, like <HI>Gallio,</HI> they care for no &s;uch Things. But how|ever indifferent &s;ome Governours may be about it, yet they may be a&s;&s;ured, that GOD will require a due Di&s;charge of the&s;e Offices at their Hands. For if, as the Apo&s;tle argues, <HI>He that does not provide for his own Hou&s;e,</HI> in temporal Things, <HI>has denied the Faith, and is wor&s;e than an Infidel;</HI> to what greater Degree of Apo&s;tacy mu&s;t he have arrived, who takes no Thought to provide for the Spiritual Welfare of his Family!</P>
<P>BUT farther, Per&s;ons are generally very liberal of their Invectives again&s;t the Clergy, and think they ju&s;tly blame the Conduct of that Mini&s;ter who does not take heed to and watch over the Flock, of which the Holy Gho&s;t has made him Over&s;eer: But may not every Governour of a Family be in a lower Degree liable to the &s;ame Cen&s;ure, who takes no thought for
<PB N="9" REF="004450_0007_100D9DFF67F343B0">
tho&s;e Souls that are committed to his Charge? For e|very Hou&s;e is, as it were a little Pari&s;h, every Gover|nour (as was before ob&s;erved) a Prie&s;t, every Family a Flock; and if any of them peri&s;h through the Go|vernour's Neglect, their Blood will GOD require at their Hands.</P>
<P>WAS a Mini&s;ter to di&s;regard Teaching his People publickly and from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and to excu&s;e him&s;elf by &s;aying, that He had enough to do to work out his own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, without concerning him&s;elf with that of Others: Would not any one be apt to think &s;uch a Mini&s;ter to be like the unju&s;t Judge, <HI>One that neither feared GOD or regarded Man?</HI> And yet, odious as &s;uch a Character would be, it is no wor&s;e than that Gover|nour of a Family de&s;erves, who thinks him&s;elf obliged only to &s;ave his own Soul, without paying any regard to the Souls of his Hou&s;hold. For (as was above hinted) every Hou&s;e is, as it were, a Pari&s;h, and every Ma&s;ter is concern'd to &s;ecure, as much as in him lies, the Spiritual Pro&s;perity of every one under his Roof, as any Mini&s;ter whatever is obliged to look to the Spiritual Welfare of every individual Per&s;on under his Charge.</P>
<P>WHAT Precedents Men, who neglect their Duty in this Particular, can plead for &s;uch Omi&s;&s;ion, I can|not tell: Doubtle&s;s not the Example of Holy <HI>Job,</HI> who was &s;o far from imagining that He had no con|cern, as Governour of a Family, with any one's Soul but his Own, that the Scripture acquaints us, <HI>When the Days of his Children's Fea&s;ting were gone about, that Job &s;ent and &s;anctified them, and offered Burnt Offerings according to the Number of them all; For Job &s;aid, It
<PB N="10" REF="004450_0008_100D9E027A8F2278">
may be that my Sons have &s;inned and cur&s;ed GOD in their Hearts: Thus did Job continually.</HI> Nor can they plead the Practice of Good Old <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> whom in the Text we find as much concerned for his Hou&s;hold's Welfare as his own. Nor la&s;tly, that of <HI>Cornelius,</HI> who <HI>feared GOD,</HI> not only him&s;elf, but with <HI>all his Hou&s;e:</HI> And were <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> but of the &s;ame Spirit of <HI>Job, Jo&s;hua,</HI> and the <HI>Gentile</HI> Centurion, they would act as <HI>Job, Jo&s;hua,</HI> and <HI>Cornelius</HI> did.</P>
<P>BUT, alas! if this be the Ca&s;e, and all Governours of Families ought not only to &s;erve the LORD them&s;elves, but likewi&s;e to &s;ee that their re&s;pective Hou&s;holds do &s;o too: What will then become of tho&s;e who not only neglect &s;erving GOD them&s;elves, but al&s;o make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to ridicule and &s;coff at any of their Hou&s;e that do? Who are not content with <HI>not entering into the Kingdom of Heaven them&s;elves; but tho&s;e al&s;o that are willing to enter in they hinder.</HI> Surely &s;uch Men are Factors for the Devil indeed. Surely their Damnation &s;lumbereth not: For although GOD, in his Good Providence, may &s;uffer &s;uch Stumbling-blocks to be put in his Children's Ways, and &s;uffer their greate&s;t Enemies to be tho&s;e of their own Hou&s;holds, for a Trial of their Sincerity, and Im|provement of their Faith; yet we cannot but pro|nounce a <HI>Wo</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e Ma&s;ters <HI>by whom &s;uch Offen|ces come.</HI> For if tho&s;e that only take care of their own Souls can &s;carcely be &s;aved, where will &s;uch mon|&s;trou&s;ly profane and wicked Governours appear?</P>
<P>BUT hoping there is but few of this unhappy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> we now to the</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004450_0009_100D9E04D3B6B120">
II. <HI>Second</HI> Thing propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> To &s;hew after what Manner a Governour and his Hou&s;hold ought to <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. AND the Fir&s;t Thing I &s;hall mention is Read|ing the Word of GOD. This is a Duty incumbent on every private Per&s;on. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life,</HI> is a Precept given by our ble&s;&s;ed LORD indifferently to all: But much more &s;o ought every Governour of a Family to think it in a peculiar Manner &s;poken to him&s;elf, becau&s;e (as hath been already proved) he ought t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook upon him&s;elf as a Prophet, and therefore, agr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">bly to &s;uch a Character as bound to in&s;truct tho&s;e un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> his Charge in the Knowledge of the Word of GOD.</P>
<P>THIS we find was the Order GOD gave his pecu|liar People of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> For thus &s;peaks his Repre&s;en|tative <HI>Mo&s;es, Deuteronomy</HI> vi. 6, 7. <HI>The&s;e Words,</HI> that is the Scripture Words, <HI>which I command thee this Day, &s;hall be in thy Heart, and thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy Children,</HI> that is, as it is generally explained, <HI>Servants,</HI> as well as Children, <HI>and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thy Hou&s;e.</HI> From whence we may infer, that the only Rea&s;on why &s;o many neglect to read the Words of Scripture diligently to their Children is, becau&s;e the Words of Scripture are not in their Hearts; for if they were, out of the Abundance of the Heart their Mouths would &s;peak.</P>
<P>BESIDES, Servants as well as Children are, for the generality, very ignorant, and mere Novices in the Laws of GOD: And how &s;hall they know, unle&s;s &s;ome one teach them? And what more proper to teach them by, than the lively Oracles of GOD,<HI><PB N="12" REF="004450_0010_100D9E0734CD1ED0">
which are able to make them wi&s;e unto Salvation?</HI> And who more proper to in&s;truct them by the&s;e Lively Oracles, than Parents and Ma&s;ters, who (as hath been more than once before ob&s;erved) are as much con|cerned to feed them with Spiritural as with Bodily Bread, Day by Day.</P>
<P>BUT if the&s;e Things be &s;o, What a mi&s;erable Con|dition are tho&s;e unhappy Governours in, who are &s;o far from feeding tho&s;e committed to their Care with the &s;incere Milk of the Word, to the intent they may grow thereby, that they neither &s;earch the Scriptures them&s;elves, nor are careful to explain them to Others? Such Bamilies mu&s;t be in a happy Way indeed to do their Ma&s;ter's Will, who take &s;uch prodigious Pains to know it! Would not one imagine that they had turned Converts to the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> that they thought <HI>Ignorance</HI> the Mother of <HI>Devotion;</HI> that tho&s;e were to be condemned as Hereticks, who read their BIBLES? And yet how few Families are there among&s;t us, who do not act after this un&s;eemly Man|ner! But, <HI>&s;hall I prai&s;e them in this? I prai&s;e them not: Brethren, this Thing ought not &s;o to be.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. PASS we on now to the Second Means whereby every Governour and his Hou&s;hold ought to &s;erve the LORD, <HI>viz. Family Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a Duty though as much neglected, yet as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary as the former. <HI>Reading</HI> is a good Preparative for <HI>Prayer,</HI> as <HI>Prayer</HI> is an excellent Means to render <HI>Reading</HI> effectual. And the Rea&s;on why every Governour of a Family &s;hould join both the&s;e Exerci&s;es together is plain, becau&s;e a Gover|nour of a Family cannot perform his <HI>Prie&s;tly</HI> Office
<PB N="13" REF="004450_0011_100D9E08DD303AA0">
(which we before ob&s;erved he is in &s;ome Degree in|ve&s;ted with) without performing this Duty of <HI>Family Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>WE find it therefore remarked, when mention is made of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel'</HI>s offering Sacrifices, that they <HI>brought</HI> them. But to whom did they bring them? Why, in all probability to their Father <HI>Adam,</HI> who, as Prie&s;t of the Family, was to offer Sacrifice in their Names. And &s;o likewi&s;e ought every &s;piritual Son of the Second <HI>Adam,</HI> who is intru&s;ted with the Care of an Hou&s;hold, to offer up the Spiritual Sacrifices of Supplications and Thank&s;givings acceptable to GOD through JESUS CHRIST, in the Pre&s;ence and Name of all who wait upon or eat Meat at his Table.</P>
<P>THUS we read our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord behaved, when he tabernacled among&s;t us: For it is &s;aid often, that <HI>He was alone</HI> praying with his Twelve Di&s;ciples, which was then his little Family. And He him&s;elf has promi&s;ed a particular Ble&s;&s;ing to joint Supplica|tions: <HI>For where&s;oever,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>two or three are ga|thered together in my Name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them.</HI> And again, <HI>If two or three are agreed touching any Thing they &s;hall a&s;k, it &s;hall be given them.</HI> Add to this, that we are commanded by the Apo&s;tle to <HI>pray always, with all Manner of Supplication,</HI> which doubtle&s;s includes <HI>Family Prayer.</HI> And Holy <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> when he &s;et up the Good Re&s;olution in the Text, that He and his Hou&s;hold would <HI>&s;erve the LORD,</HI> certainly re&s;olved withal to pray with his Family, which is one of the be&s;t Te&s;timonies they could give of their &s;erving Him.</P>
<P>BESIDES, there are no Families, but what have &s;ome common Ble&s;&s;ings, of which they have been all
<PB N="14" REF="004450_0012_100D9E0BEEB1C7F8">
Partakers, to give Thanks for; &s;ome common Cro&s;&s;es and Afflictions, which they are to pray again&s;t; &s;ome common Sins which they are all bound to lament and bewail: But how this can be done without joining together in one common Act of Humiliation, Suppli|cation, and Thank&s;giving, is difficult to devi&s;e.</P>
<P>FROM all which Con&s;iderations put together, it is evident, that <HI>Family Prayer</HI> is a great and nece&s;&s;ary Duty; and con&s;equently tho&s;e Governours that neglect it are certainly without Excu&s;e. And it is much to be feared, if they live without <HI>Family Prayer,</HI> they live <HI>without GOD in the World.</HI></P>
<P>AND yet &s;uch an hateful Character as this is, it is to be feared, that, was GOD to &s;end out an Angel to de&s;troy us as he did once de&s;troy the <HI>Egyptians</HI> Fir&s;t-born, and withal give him a Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>as then,</HI> to &s;pare no Hou&s;es but where they &s;aw the Blood of the Lintel &s;prinkled on the Door-po&s;t, &s;o <HI>now</HI> to let no Families e&s;cape but tho&s;e that called upon him in Morning and Evening Prayer; few would remain unhurt by his avenging Sword. <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI> &s;hall I term &s;uch Families, or <HI>Heathens?</HI> Doubt|le&s;s they de&s;erve not the Name of <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> and <HI>Heathens</HI> will &s;urely ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t &s;uch profane Families of this Generation: For they had always their Hou&s;hold GODS whom they wor|&s;hipped, and who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance they frequently in|voked. And a pretty pa&s;s tho&s;e Families &s;urely are arrived at, who mu&s;t be &s;ent to School to <HI>Pagans.</HI> But will not the LORD be avenged on &s;uch pro|fane Hou&s;holds as the&s;e? Will he not pour out his Fury upon tho&s;e that call not upon his Name?</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="004450_0013_100D9E0E5D563160">
3. BUT it is Time for me to ha&s;ten to the Third and la&s;t Means I &s;hall recommend, whereby every Go|vernour ought with his Hou&s;hold to <HI>&s;erve the LORD, viz.</HI> by <HI>Catechizing</HI> and <HI>In&s;tructing</HI> their Children and Servants, and bringing them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD.</P>
<P>THAT this, as well as the two former, is a Duty incumbent on every Governour of an Hou&s;e, appears from that famous Encomium or Commendation GOD gives of <HI>Abraham. I know,</HI> &s;ays the Mo&s;t High, <HI>that He will command his Children and his Hou&s;hold after him to keep the Way of the LORD, to do Ju&s;tice and Judgment.</HI> And indeed &s;carce any Thing is more frequently pre&s;&s;ed upon us in Holy Writ than this Duty of <HI>Catechizing.</HI> Thus &s;ays GOD in a Pa&s;&s;age before cited, <HI>Thou &s;halt teach the&s;e Words diligently unto thy Children.</HI> And Parents are commanded in the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> to <HI>breed up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD.</HI> The Holy P&s;almi&s;t acquaints us, that one great End why GOD did &s;o great Wonders for his People was, <HI>to the Intent that when they grew up they &s;hould &s;hew their Children or Servants, the &s;ame.</HI> And in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> Chap. vi. at the 20th and following Ver&s;es, GOD &s;trictly commands his People to in&s;truct their Children in the true Nature of the Ceremonial Wor&s;hip, when they &s;hould enquire about it, as he &s;uppo&s;ed they would do in Time to come. And if Servants and Children were to be in&s;tructed in the Nature of <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rites, much more ought they <HI>now</HI> to be initiated and ground|ed in the Doctrines and fir&s;t Principles of the Go&s;pel of CHRIST: Not only becau&s;e it is a Revelation, which has brought Life and Immortality to a fuller
<PB N="16" REF="004450_0014_100D9E0FF19A16F0">
and clearer Light, but al&s;o becau&s;e many Seducers are gone abroad into the World, who do their utmo&s;t Endeavour to de&s;troy not only the Super&s;tructure, but likewi&s;e to &s;ap the very Foundation of our mo&s;t Holy Religion.</P>
<P>WOULD, then, the pre&s;ent Generation have their Po&s;terity be true Lovers and Honourers of GOD, Ma&s;ters and Parents mu&s;t take <HI>Solomon'</HI>s good Advice, and train up and catechize their re&s;pective Hou&s;holds in the Way wherein they &s;hould go.</P>
<P>I AM aware but of one Objection that can, with any Shew of Rea&s;on, be urged again&s;t what has been advanced; which is, That &s;uch a Procedure as this will take up too much Time, and hinder Families too long from their Worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s. But it is much to be que&s;tioned whether Per&s;ons that &s;tart &s;uch an Ob|jection are not of the &s;ame hypocritical Spirit as the Traytor <HI>Judas,</HI> who had Indignation again&s;t Devout <HI>Mary,</HI> who being &s;o profu&s;e of her Ointment, in anointing our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, and a&s;ked Why it might not be &s;old for Two Hundred Pence, and given to the Poor. For has GOD given us &s;o much Time to work for Our&s;elves, and &s;hall we not allow &s;ome &s;mall Pittance of it, Morning and Evening, to be devoted to his more immediate Wor&s;hip and Service? Have not People read, That it is GOD who gives Men Power to get Wealth, and therefore that the be&s;t Way to pro&s;per in the World is to &s;ecure his Favour? And has not our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf promi&s;ed, that if we &s;eek fir&s;t the Kingdom of GOD and his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, all outward Nece&s;&s;aries &s;hall be added unto us?</P>

<HI>Abraham,</HI> no doubt, was a Man of as great Bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;uch Objectors may be; but yet He would find Time, to command his Hou&s;hold to <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI> Nay, <HI>David,</HI> was a King, and con&s;equently had a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s upon his Hands; yet notwith&s;tand|ing, He profe&s;&s;es that he would Walk in his Hou&s;e with a perfect Heart. And, to in&s;tance but one more, Holy <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was a Per&s;on certainly engaged very much in Temporal Affairs; and yet He &s;olemnly declares before all <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> That, as for him and his Hou&s;hold, they would <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI> And did Per&s;ons but redeem their Time, as <HI>Abraham, David,</HI> or <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> did, they would no longer complain that Family Duties kept them too long from the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the World.</P>
<P>III. BUT my <HI>Third</HI> and la&s;t General Head, under which I was to offer &s;ome Motives, in order to excite all Governours, with their re&s;pective Hou&s;holds, to <HI>&s;erve-the LORD</HI> in the Manner before recommended, I hope, will &s;erve in&s;tead of a Thou&s;and Arguments, to prove the Weakne&s;s and Folly of any &s;uch Ob|jection.</P>
<P N="1">1. AND the fir&s;t Motive I &s;hall mention is the Duty of Gratitude, you that are Governours of Fami|lies owe to GOD.&mdash;Your Lot, every one mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, is ca&s;t into a fair Ground: Providence hath given you a goodly Heritage, above many of your Fellow Creatures, and therefore, out of a Principle of Grati|tude, you ought to endeavour, as much as in you lies, to make every Per&s;on of your re&s;pective Hou&s;holds to call upon him as long as they live: (Not to men|tion)

that the Authority, with which GOD has inve&s;ted you as Parents and Governours of Families, is a Ta|lent committed to your Tru&s;t, and which you are bound to improve to your Ma&s;ter's Honour. In other Things we find Governours and Parents can ex|erci&s;e Lord&s;hip over their Children and Servants, and frequently enough can &s;ay to one <HI>Go,</HI> and he goeth; to another <HI>Come,</HI> and he cometh; to a third, <HI>Do this,</HI> and he doeth it. And &s;hall this Power be &s;o often em|ployed in your own Affairs, and never exerted in the Things of GOD? Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O Heavens, at this.</P>
<P>THUS did not faithful <HI>Abraham;</HI> No, GOD &s;ays, that He knew <HI>Abraham</HI> would <HI>command his Servants and Children after him.</HI> Thus did not <HI>Jo&s;hua:</HI> No, He was re&s;olved not only to walk with GOD him&s;elf, but to improve his Authority in making all about him do &s;o too: <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;hold, we will &s;erve the LORD.</HI> Let us go and do likewi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. BUT, Secondly, If <HI>Gratitude</HI> to GOD will not, methinks <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Pity</HI> to your Children &s;hould move you, with your re&s;pective Families, to <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>MOST People expre&s;s a great Fondne&s;s for their Children; nay &s;o great, that very often their own Lives are wrapped up in tho&s;e of their Offspring. <HI>Can a Woman forget her &s;ucking Child, that &s;he &s;hould not have Compa&s;&s;ion on the Son of her Womb?</HI> &s;ays GOD by his Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah.</HI> He &s;peaks of it as a mon&s;trous Thing, and &s;carce credible. But the Words immedi|ately following affirm it to be po&s;&s;ible, <HI>Yea They may forget;</HI> and Experience al&s;o a&s;&s;ures us they may.

<HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother</HI> may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">th <HI>for&s;ake their Children:</HI> For what greater Degree of Forgetfulne&s;s can they ex|pre&s;s towards them, than to neglect the Improvement of their better Part, and not bring them up in the Knowledge and Fear of GOD.</P>
<P>IT is true, indeed, Parents &s;eldom forget to provide for their Children's Bodies, (though, it is to be feared, &s;ome Men are &s;o far &s;unk beneath the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, as to neglect even that;) but then how often do they forget, or rather when do they remember, to &s;ecure the Salvation of their immortal Souls: But is this their Way of expre&s;&s;ing their Fondne&s;s for the Fruit of their Bodies? Is this the be&s;t Te&s;timony they can give of their Affection to the Darling of their Hearts? Then was <HI>Dalilah</HI> fond of <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> when &s;he delivered him up into the Hands of the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI> Then were tho&s;e Ruffians well affected to <HI>Daniel,</HI> when they threw him into a Den of Lions.</P>
<P N="3">3. BUT, Thirdly, if neither <HI>Gratitude</HI> to GOD, nor <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Pity</HI> to your Children, will prevail on you; yet let a Principle of common <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> move you to &s;et up the holy Re&s;olution in the Text.</P>
<P>THIS is a Principle which all Men would be thought to act upon. But certainly, if any may be truly cen|&s;ured for their Inju&s;tice, none can be more liable to &s;uch Cen&s;ure than tho&s;e who think them&s;elves injured if their Servants withdraw them&s;elves from their bodily Work, and yet they in return take no care of their ine&s;timable Souls. For is it ju&s;t that Servants &s;hould &s;pend their Time and Strength in their Ma&s;ter's Ser|vice, and Ma&s;ters not at the &s;ame Time give them what is ju&s;t and equal for their Service?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="004450_0018_100D9E184774A160">
IT is true, &s;ome Men may think they have done enough when they give unto their Servants Food and Rayment, and &s;ay, Did not I bargain with thee for &s;o much a Year? But if they give them no other Reward than this, What do they do le&s;s for their very Bea&s;ts? But are not Servants better than they? Doubtle&s;s they are: And however Ma&s;ters may put off their Con|victions for the pre&s;ent, they will find a Time will come, when they &s;hall know they ought to have given them &s;ome Spiritual, as well as Temporal Wages; and the Cry of tho&s;e that have mowed down their Fields will enter into the Ears of the LORD of <HI>Sabaoth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. BUT, Fourthly, If neither <HI>Gratitude</HI> to GOD, <HI>Pity</HI> to Children, nor a Principle of common <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> to Servants, are &s;ufficient to balance all Objections; yet let that darling, that prevailing Motive of <HI>Self-Intere&s;t</HI> turn the Scale, and engage you with your re&s;pective Hou&s;holds to <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>THIS weights greatly with you in other Matters: Be then per&s;uaded to let it have a due and full Influ|ence on you in this; and if it has, if you have but Faith as a Grain of Mu&s;tard-Seed, how can you avoid believing that promoting <HI>Family Religion</HI> would be the be&s;t Means to promote your own temporal as well as eternal Welfare? For <HI>Godline&s;s has the Promi&s;e of the Life that now is, as well as that which is to come.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES, you all, doubtle&s;s, wi&s;h for hone&s;t Ser|vants and pious Children; and to have them prove otherwi&s;e, would be as great a Grief to you as it was to <HI>Elijah</HI> to have a treacherous <HI>Gahazi,</HI> or <HI>David</HI> to be troubled with a rebellious <HI>Ab&s;alom.</HI> But how can it be

expected they &s;hould learn their Duty, except tho&s;e &s;et over them take care to teach it them? Is it not as rea&s;onable to expect you &s;hould reap where you had not &s;own, or gather where you had not &s;trawed?</P>
<P>DID Chri&s;tianity, indeed, give any Countenance to Children and Servants to di&s;regard their <HI>Parents and Ma&s;ters according to the Fle&s;h,</HI> or repre&s;ent their Duty to them as incon&s;i&s;tent with their entire Obedience to their <HI>Father and Ma&s;ter which is in Heaven,</HI> there might then be &s;ome Pretence to neglect in&s;tructing them in the Principles of &s;uch a Religion. But &s;ince the Precepts of this pure and undefiled. Religion are all of them holy, ju&s;t, and good; and the more they are taught their Duty to GOD, the better they will per|form their Duties to you; methinks then to neglect the Improvement of their Souls, out of a Dread of &s;pending too much Time in Religious Duties is act|ing quite contrary to your own Intere&s;t, as well as Duty.</P>
<P N="5">5. Fifthly and la&s;tly, If neither <HI>Gratitude</HI> to GOD, <HI>Love</HI> to your Children, common <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> to your Ser|vants, nor even that mo&s;t prevailing Motive <HI>Self-Inte|re&s;t,</HI> will excite; yet let a Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Terrors of the LORD</HI> per&s;uade you to put in Practice the pious Re&s;olution in the Text. Remember the Time will come, and that perhaps very &s;hortly, when we mu&s;t all appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST; where we mu&s;t give a &s;olemn and &s;trict Account how we have had our Conver&s;ation, in our re&s;pective Families in this World. How will you endure to &s;ee your Children and Servants (who ought to be your Joy and Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of our Lord JESUS

CHRIST) coming out as &s;o many &s;wift Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t you; cur&s;ing the Father that begat them, the Womb that bare them, the Paps which they have &s;ucked, and the Day they ever entered into your Hou|&s;es? Think you not the Damnation which Men mu&s;t endure for their own Sins will be &s;ufficient, that they need load them&s;elves with the additional Guilt of being acce&s;&s;ary to the Damnation of others al&s;o? Oh con&s;ider this, all ye that forget to &s;erve the LORD with your re&s;pective Hou&s;holds, <HI>le&s;t he pluck you away and there be none to deliver you!</HI></P>
<P>BUT GOD forbid, Brethren, that any &s;uch Evil &s;hould befall you: No, rather will I hope that you have been, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, convinced by what has been &s;aid of the great Importance of <HI>Family Religion;</HI> and therefore are ready to cry out, in the Words im|mediately following the Text, <HI>GOD forbid that we &s;hould for&s;ake the LORD;</HI> and again, Ver&s;e 21. <HI>Nay but we will,</HI> with our re&s;pective Hou&s;holds, <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>AND that there may be always &s;uch a Heart in you, Let me, to conclude, exhort all Governours of Fami|lies, in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, often to reflect on the ine&s;timable Worth of their own Souls, and the infinite Ran&s;om, even the precious Blood of JESUS CHRIST, which has been paid down for them. Remember, I be&s;eech you remember, that you are fal|len Creatures, that you are by Nature lo&s;t to and e&s;tranged from GOD; and that you can never be re|&s;tored to your primitive Happine&s;s, 'till by being born again of the Holy Gho&s;t, you arrive at your primitive State of Purity, have the Image of GOD rein&s;tamped

upon your Souls, and are thereby made meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance with the Saints in Light. Do, I &s;ay, but &s;eriou&s;ly and frequently reflect on, and act as Per&s;ons that believe &s;uch important Truths, and you will no more neglect your Family's &s;piritual Wel|fare than your own. No, the <HI>Love of GOD,</HI> which will then be <HI>&s;hed abroad in your Hearts, will con&s;train you</HI> to do your utmo&s;t to pre&s;erve them: And the deep Sen&s;e of GOD's free Grace, in CHRIST JESUS, (which you will then have,) in calling you, will excite you to do your utmo&s;t to &s;ave others, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of your own Hou&s;hold, and though, after all your pious Endeavours, &s;ome may continue unreformed; yet you will have this comfortable Reflection to make, that you did what you could to make your Families <HI>religious;</HI> and therefore may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of &s;itting down in the Kingdom of Heaven, with <HI>Abraham, Jo&s;hua,</HI> and <HI>Cor|nelius,</HI> and all the godly Hou&s;holders, who in their &s;e|veral Generations &s;hone forth as &s;o many Lights in their re&s;pective Hou&s;holds upon Earth.</P>
