<Q>HE THAT RULETH OVER MEN MUST BE JUST, RULING IN THE FEAR OF GOD.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A CHARACTER formed upon the principles of religion is the mo&s;t honorable and u&s;eful. It compri&s;es all the virtues that recommend man to the peculiar notice of his MAKER, render him an ornament to &s;ociety, make him happy in a &s;tate of &s;ocial connection in the pre&s;ent world, and glorious in immortality.</P>
<P>SUCH a character was David, <HI>The anointed of the God of Jacob:</HI> and he in&s;i&s;ts upon the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of it in tho&s;e who rule over men. Nor does he offer merely his own private opinion re&s;pecting this important &s;ubject, for the Spirit of the LORD
<PB N="6" REF="031126_0005_0FEBE3D81D60DFC0">
was with him&mdash;<HI>The GOD of I&s;rael &s;aid, the Rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me,</HI> HE THAT RULETH OVER MEN MUST BE JUST, RULING IN THE FEAR OF GOD.</P>
<P>THE royal Prophet here points out, in a very brief and comprehen&s;ive manner, the duty, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ary qualifications of a civil ruler. The&s;e words ought to be engraven in the heart of every ruler, and in the heart of every per&s;on in the choice of rulers; for while they direct the latter to whom they ought to give their &s;uffrages, they point out to the former the character which they &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is both pertinent and laudable, and mu&s;t be con&s;idered &s;o, by all good men, to enter on the pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s of legi&s;lation, by the pre&s;entment of the rulers and officers of Government before the LORD in his &s;acred courts, to hear the words of his law, and to &s;upplicate his pre&s;ence and aid. We are happy that our civil Fathers have con&s;ecrated the pre&s;ent time to the&s;e &s;olemn duties of religion. The occa|&s;ion on which we are a&s;&s;embled, and the theme which I have cho&s;en, will naturally lead me to make &s;ome remarks on government; delineate the character of a good ruler; exhibit the nece&s;&s;ity of religion in civil admini&s;trations, and its happy effects in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>MUTUAL advantage, at fir&s;t induced men to form into &s;ocial compact, and produced towns, &s;tates and
<PB N="7" REF="031126_0006_0FEBE3E07371FF88">
empires. To exi&s;t in this &s;ocial capacity, and &s;ecure life, property and happine&s;s, it was found nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould have &s;ome form of civil government. It is the will of GOD, that government &s;hould exi&s;t among men. What particular form is no where de|&s;ignated, but every nation has a right to choo&s;e for it&s;elf, and adapt it to the views, feelings and circum|&s;tances of the people. One form may be be&s;t for one nation, and a different, for another. That form is be&s;t, which mo&s;t effectually &s;ecures their rights and rational liberties.</P>
<P>To the due admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome &s;hould be clothed with authority; without this, they will not be able to regulate the affairs of &s;tate, and &s;ecure the good and peaceable, from the wanton abu&s;e of the wicked and licentious. Their power, it is true, they derive from the people, but when they have inve&s;ted them with authority they &s;hould pay due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, and place confidence in them.</P>
<P>A RACE of rational beings, not connected by the parental or filial tie, not depraved, but perfectly inno|cent, it is probable would fall into &s;ome kind of poli|ty or civil connection. By forming into &s;ociety the collected gifts and graces of all would become the property and emolument of all; but without &s;ocial connection, they would be the property and profit
<PB N="8" REF="031126_0007_0FEBE3E31850E250">
only of the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, and could not benefit the whole. Society cannot be formed, or &s;ub|&s;i&s;t, without certain regulations, or con&s;titutional e&s;|tabli&s;hments. Such a race of beings, as we before mentioned, could find no difficulty in forming into union, and con&s;tituting the &s;ocial tie. If their pow|ers and capacities were different, rea&s;on would plain|ly lead the &s;uperior to the head, and the inferior to their re&s;pective places of &s;ubordination in the body. Or, if in regard to powers and capacities, all were on a par, then all would equally govern, and be equally &s;ubject. The good Angels are repre&s;ented as having a kind of connection and order among them. The &s;acred books &s;peak of Principalities and Powers, Thrones and Dominions; and the &s;uperiority &s;igni|fied by this nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es connection and &s;ub|ordination. But be it as it may among good and holy beings, yet obviou&s;ly among beings &s;o deeply depraved and &s;elfi&s;h as man, government is in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. Without government, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to live in &s;uch a world as ours. A &s;tate of anarchy, without law and government, would be a &s;tate of complete wretchedne&s;s.&mdash;Such are the fierce and &s;avage lu&s;ts of men, that pro|perty and life would con&s;tantly hang on uncertainty. The I&s;rael<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> nation found them&s;elves in a mo&s;t cal|amitous &s;tat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> when there was no Government au|thoritatively e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, and <HI>every one

Here he will find a model&punc; on which his character &s;hould be formed; and rules <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to his whole conduct. It teaches him to reverence GOD as the Supreme Ruler of na|tions, his dependence on Him for light and direction,
<PB N="10" REF="031126_0009_0FEBE3E7D9668870">
and his accountablene&s;s to Him for all his actions: and this will have a happy influence on his conduct and excite him to fidelity. It unfolds a glorious im|mortality, through JESUS CHRIST, to tho&s;e who are faithful to GOD in the tru&s;t committed to them, and improve their talents aright: by which glorious hope the pious ruler is animated in his laborious un|dertaking.</P>
<P>IT humbles the pride of the human heart, teaches that &s;alvation is only through the grace that is in JESUS, and lays pro&s;trate the hope of man from any di&s;tingui&s;hed merit in him&s;elf; which mu&s;t tend to in&s;pire the chri&s;tian ruler with an amiable humility, while rai&s;ed to a &s;eat of honor; prevent his exalting him&s;elf above his Brethren, and lording it over GOD'S heritage. It teaches the motives, by which they are to be influenced in all their deliberations and de|crees. Influenced by &s;uch a religion, the Ruler will con&s;ult the good of the community, and will always live in the affections of a grateful people. He will have a humble dependence on GOD for wi&s;dom to conduct him. He will &s;ee his need of divine a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and be mode&s;t and una&s;&s;uming. He will not croud him&s;elf into public notice by artifice, but wait until he is called by the voluntary &s;uffrages of the people. Tho&s;e, who are be&s;t qualified to rule, will be lea&s;t &s;olicitous to obtain an office. A &s;en&s;e of the importance of a public tru&s;t, and of having the
<PB N="11" REF="031126_0010_0FEBE3EFA3514280">
weight of public affairs devolve on them, forbids their a&s;piring to rule. Per&s;uaded that the mo&s;t refined enjoyments are to be found in the walks of dome&s;tic retirement, they will quit them for an elevated &s;ta|tion, only when called by the united voice of their brethren, and con&s;trained by a &s;en&s;e of duty. There is no greater evidence of a per&s;on's unfitne&s;s for pub|lic tru&s;t than his &s;eeking it by promoting faction. True merit does not &s;eek public notice, and it reluc|tantly enters the field of action. The good ruler will therefore engage in public life, not to gratify his own ambition, con&s;ult his own ea&s;e, or obtain the applau&s;e of men; but from a &s;en&s;e of duty.</P>
<P>WHEN clothed with authority, he will be con|cerned that his admini&s;trations be con&s;i&s;tent with the will of GOD, and promotive of the public good. He governs for the whole, and con&s;ults the advantage of &s;ociety. No per&s;onal or partial con&s;iderations will influence him to turn a&s;ide from duty. Awed by the fear of GOD, and a &s;en&s;e of his accountable|ne&s;s, he pur&s;ues a &s;teady cour&s;e, nor is influenced by the adulations of friends or the clamours of pretend|ed patriots. He will always make it his endeavour to enact wi&s;e and &s;alutary laws, which are e&s;&s;ential to pre&s;erve the peace and order of &s;ociety. Much wi&s;dom and integrity are nece&s;&s;ary to direct the rul|er in framing &s;uch laws, and to pre&s;erve him from the baleful influence of &s;elfi&s;h and party motives. While
<PB N="12" REF="031126_0011_0FEBE3F259473CB8">
the unju&s;t aims to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch laws as will be&s;t promote his own &s;elfi&s;h ends, the ju&s;t will con&s;ult the good of his con&s;tituents. The ruler of this cha|racter will look, not merely to the emolument of in|dividuals, but he will &s;eek the be&s;t good of the whole circle: like the parent of a numerous offspring, he has a tender regard for every member, feels intere&s;t|ed in their united pro&s;perity, and will not &s;acrifice the peace of the family, to gratify the capricious humours of a few.</P>
<P>A RULER of this de&s;cription will not only enact laws which are founded on the principles of ju&s;tice; but will take care that they be faithfully executed. The wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t code of laws will be of advan|tage to a community, only &s;o far as they are ac|companied with a faithful execution. He will not only obey the laws him&s;elf, and recommend &s;uch obedience to others, by his own example; but will u&s;e the power, with which he is ve&s;ted, to enforce obedience from the unruly. He will be a terror to tho&s;e who do evil, and while he puni&s;hes the guilty, he will prai&s;e and encourage tho&s;e who do well. Firm in the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, not over-awed by popular clamour, he will &s;teadily pur|&s;ue the dictates of con&s;cience, knowing he has a Ma&s;ter in Heaven, to whom he mu&s;t give an account. He will not &s;acrifice truth and ju&s;tice, though it i&s;|&s;ue in popular odium, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from public
<PB N="13" REF="031126_0012_0FEBE3F4649DA070">
&s;ervice. He will not pu&s;illanimou&s;ly &s;hrink from duty, becau&s;e it is attended with difficulty and op|po&s;ition; but courageou&s;ly &s;tem the torrent, until, over-borne by its impetuo&s;ity, he is compelled to recede from danger. Influenced in all his proceed|ings, by the fear of GOD, he will be more power|fully prompted to a cour&s;e of rectitude, than by all the adulations or cen&s;ures of men.</P>
<P>How contemptible mu&s;t be that ruler, who has no opinion of his own, but is blown about by every gale of temptation, and complies with the caprices of evil and de&s;igning men! Firmne&s;s and &s;tability are very e&s;&s;ential qualities in a good ruler. But, let his talents and abilities be ever &s;o great, and his political acquirements ever &s;o con&s;picuous, he will be but poorly qualified for a &s;tation of eminence, who has no reverence for GOD, and regard for his religion. His hone&s;ty and integrity mu&s;t be doubt|ed. It is to be feared he would neglect the inter|e&s;t of tho&s;e, who&s;e pro&s;perity he &s;hould &s;eek, and &s;port with the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>MEN devoid of every principle of religion, un|awed by the fear of GOD, and unre&s;trained by his commands, cannot rea&s;onably expect to be entru&s;t|ed with the lives and liberties of the people; nor that they will countenance their vices. They cannot put confidence in them; for there is, there indeed can
<PB N="14" REF="031126_0013_0FEBE3F69EB4F640">
be no rea&s;on to think, that they will regard men, who have no fear of GOD before their eyes. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that the fear of GOD be fixed in the heart of him, who rules over men, and that he be influenced by it in all his conduct.</P>
<P>RULERS &s;hould not only be concerned that their admini&s;trations be good, but mu&s;t them&s;elves obey tho&s;e laws, which they enjoin on others. If the mak|ers of the laws be the fir&s;t to break them, they have every rea&s;on to expect that many will follow their example.</P>
<P>RULERS are &s;et for an example to the people.&mdash;They are to reprove tho&s;e who violate the laws, and encourage tho&s;e who keep them, by exhibiting a pattern for their imitation, not only in civil, but di|vine precepts; and, in this way, be nur&s;ing Fathers to the Church. The example of tho&s;e, who are ele|vated to office, will always, in a greater or le&s;s de|gree, influence &s;ociety. The people look to them, and form their manners, their dre&s;s and behaviour; al&s;o their &s;entiments and practice, in a political and a religious view. The body of the people, general|ly, receive their moral and political complection from tho&s;e, who are in eminent &s;tations. The rulers of I&s;rael formed the manners of the nation. When they were wicked and corrupt, general wickedne&s;s
<PB N="15" REF="031126_0014_0FEBE3F90F4852B0">
and idolatry prevailed. Thus, in the time of our Saviour, when the prejudices of the people run high, they enquired, whether, <HI>Any of the Rulers of the peo|ple believed on him;</HI> intimating, that the conduct of their rulers, would influence their minds to receive, or reject the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>So it has been, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, with other nations, and &s;o it is with our own. It is natural to look to tho&s;e of &s;uperior wi&s;dom and eminence, for example. And though &s;ome, from perver&s;ene&s;s of nature, be|ing lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of honor and &s;hame, may totally di&s;regard their good example, and others, awed by the fear of GOD, may altogether avoid their corrup|tions; yet the general body of the people are more or le&s;s influenced by them to good or evil.</P>
<P>IT is of high importance, therefore, that rulers be men of virtue; and that they reverence religion and its in&s;titutions. It is in their power to do much good, or evil: the pre&s;ent pro&s;perity, and the ever|la&s;ting welfare of multitudes may much depend on their conduct.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to the la&s;t thing propo&s;ed; which was to exhibit the nece&s;&s;ity of religion in civil admini&s;|trations, and its happy effects in &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="031126_0015_0FEBE3FB4643AEF8">
RELIGION is nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of &s;ociety; and without it, civil government cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t.&mdash;Man is endowed by his great author with &s;ocial fa|culties; but &s;o great is his depravity, that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s predominates in his heart, and he has lu&s;ts and pa&s;|&s;ions, which, if under no controul, would fill the world with vice, and its attendant mi&s;ery. The fa|culties, by which he is rai&s;ed in the &s;cale of being, make him more &s;ubtle in planning, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in effecting his wicked and de&s;tructive purpo&s;es. If the mind be impre&s;&s;ed with no idea of a GOD, every object of pur&s;uit may be contemplated with a &s;u|preme regard; and the &s;elfi&s;h would gain a compleat a&s;cendency over the benevolent affections.</P>
<P>THE aids of religious principles, in union with the powers and faculties natural to man, are in&s;ufficient to re&s;train his irregular and mi&s;chievous pa&s;&s;ions; and the latter without the former mu&s;t be much more &s;o.</P>
<P>THE light of nature indeed teaches the exi&s;tence of a GOD, and an all-wi&s;e and glorious providence, when her dictates are &s;uitably attended to; and when they are not, and men boa&s;t them&s;elves as men of rea&s;on, and through &s;ophi&s;try and ridicule attempt to &s;ubvert religion in the hearts of men, the "Age of rea&s;on" becomes an age of more than Egyptian darkne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="031126_0016_0FEBE3FDEA657848">
To guard men again&s;t the lu&s;ts and furious pa&s;|&s;ions of each other, civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, always known to be in&s;ufficient, have been connected with, or have had recour&s;e to the aids of religion.</P>
<P>WHAT could be the origin of &s;ociety without this connecting bond? And in &s;ocieties formed, nothing can &s;o powerfully induce the ruler to a wi&s;e admin|i&s;tration of government, and a faithful di&s;charge of all the duties of his office, or &s;o en&s;ure the obedi|ence of &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>A RULER cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to lo&s;e the feelings of the man by an elevation to office; he has the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions to govern, and lu&s;ts to conquer; and the government and victory of the&s;e, is rendered more difficult, by the temptations which are encrea&s;ed, and the opportunities for gratifying them, which are multiplied, by the &s;ituation in which he is placed. There are many, perhaps, who&s;e conduct is inoffen|&s;ive in the &s;tations of private life, who, if they &s;wayed a &s;ceptre, would become Neroes. But, how much &s;oever warmed with true patrioti&s;m the hearts of civil rulers may be, they cannot calculate upon the intere&s;t of their &s;ubjects, in the righteous admini&s;tration of their legal power. With re&s;pect to &s;ecret crimes, and crimes where numbers and power are enli&s;ted on the &s;ide of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, coercion will be weak, and government of no avail. Set a&s;ide the influence of religious principle, and the members of the com|munity
<PB N="18" REF="031126_0017_0FEBE4001C479408">
could have no ground for rational tru&s;t and confidence in each other. No oath could be ad|mini&s;tered in &s;uch a &s;ociety; they would live each moment in a &s;tate of alarm; government would lo&s;e all its energy; &s;ociety would be full of di&s;order, confu&s;ion and every evil work; the voice of joy would not be heard; the name of happine&s;s would not be known; and being it&s;elf would be a cur&s;e.</P>
<P>IF the being and attributes of the Mo&s;t High, an all-wi&s;e, powerful and holy providence, and the re|tributions of eternity are acknowledged, the &s;tate of things is &s;urpri&s;ingly altered for the better. Rulers may exerci&s;e the powers with which they are inve&s;t|ed, and the people, whom they govern, will obey their laws, and feel that their guardian care is a &s;ource of mutual happine&s;s to the &s;ociety of which they are members.</P>
<P>THOSE who are cordially di&s;po&s;ed to lead quiet and holy lives, cannot fail to realize, that they, their intere&s;t and happine&s;s, are rendered as &s;afe, as this &s;tate, and the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances with which they are &s;urrounded, can po&s;&s;ibly make them. And, on the other hand, men of bad hearts and evil di&s;po&s;i|tions will not be able to run into tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es, to which their unbridled lu&s;ts would lead them, with|out counteracting the dictates of con&s;cience; bur&s;t|ing a&s;under the &s;tronge&s;t bands of &s;ociety, and haz|arding,

<P>THE &s;acred books teach us the being and attri|butes of GOD. They exhibit his Maje&s;ty, his Holi|ne&s;s, his Ju&s;tice, his Goodne&s;s, his Mercy, and his Truth: His Omnipre&s;ence, his Spirituality, his Om|ni&s;cience, his Supreme and unlimited Dominion; his readine&s;s to pardon, and his determination to reward the righteous, and puni&s;h the wicked and impenitent.</P>
<P>THEY al&s;o bring us acquainted with our nature, &s;tate and circum&s;tances; with our mi&s;ery and the mode of our cure; they point out our duty in every &s;ituation, in every relation, and in all the circum|&s;tances of human life; they encourage our rational hopes, and animate us by the mo&s;t &s;ublime motives.</P>
<P>ALL other things, which are deemed nece&s;&s;ary to our peace, in the connected and &s;ocial &s;tate, will not avail without this. No natural principles, nor the be&s;t forms of government, will be &s;ufficient without the conducting guidance, and powerful energy of re|ligion. This clearly &s;hews, that the civil ruler is to be con&s;idered as GOD'S mini&s;ter, and, that the &s;ub|ject ought to yield obedience to good and &s;alutary laws, not only for wrath, but for con&s;cience &s;ake.</P>
<P>THE beauty of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem is exhibited, and its advantages to connected minds, in many and

various re&s;pects. It purifies the heart and amends the life. It refines, ennobles and exalts the affec|tions. When the civil order is broken in upon by the licentious and di&s;orderly part of &s;ociety, when men of weak heads and di&s;hone&s;t hearts officiou&s;ly attempt to guide the affairs of State, and to arraign, at their bar, the well tried and cho&s;en patriots of the commonwealth, our religion commands them to &s;tudy the things which make for peace, to &s;ubmit to good government as the ordinance of GOD, and to obey magi&s;trates as his mini&s;ters to them for good. It enjoins patrioti&s;m as a common duty; and what&s;oever we would that others &s;hould do unto us that we do the &s;ame to them&mdash;and extend a gener|ous benevolence to the whole race of man.</P>
<P>THe malevolent pa&s;&s;ions and corrupt feelings of depraved nature, if unre&s;trained, would predomi|nate over the better principles, the &s;ocial and hu|mane di&s;po&s;itions of man; and involve &s;ociety, in calamities, too many to enumerate, and too horrible to think upon.</P>
<P>THE religion of JESUS rectifies the &s;oil of the heart; eradicates tho&s;e evil di&s;po&s;itions which have been cultured there; plucks up every plant which his good hand hath not planted; re&s;trains the pa&s;&s;ions, by bringing them under its happy dominion; and fills &s;ociety with tranquility and order.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="031126_0020_0FEBE40992C4D710">
IT cultivates in the minds of men, the pure&s;t and the &s;ublime&s;t principles of virtue. It reclaims them from all tho&s;e paths of iniquity, in which, through the &s;olicitations of the wicked, and the allurements of fal&s;e honor and worldly plea&s;ure, they may have wandered; and makes them good men, and u&s;eful members of the community. It &s;ecures and pro|motes the intere&s;ts of government and the pro&s;perity of its &s;ubjects. It directs rulers and people to the duties, which are peculiar to their re&s;pective places; and by &s;etting before them the mo&s;t glorious motives, &s;weetly con&s;trains and allures to the di&s;charge of them. It promotes peace; it breathes benevolence; it cheri&s;hes the kind and &s;ocial affections, and recti|fies the morals of mankind. It prohibits every thing that is injurious to our happine&s;s, or the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e who are about us. When all the members of a community are under its influence, and conduct agreeably to its requirements, they form the mo&s;t beautiful and happy &s;ociety: the voice of pro|fanene&s;s, fraud and licentiou&s;ne&s;s will not be heard in the &s;treets; iniquity will &s;top its mouth and virtue triumph. Society is happy in pro|portion as religion flouri&s;hes. But religion has &s;ome|thing nobler in its view and tendency than the civil governments of the world; it looks forward into eter|nity; yet it is as friendly to the happine&s;s of men, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, as if it embraced no other object. It is a di&s;honorable idea of religion, and degrading

to its author, that &s;ome entertain&mdash;an idea that reli|gion is a &s;ub&s;titute to civil government, and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s no farther than the pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>WE have no rea&s;on to think, from any thing we can find in the &s;acred books, that our ble&s;&s;ed LORD de&s;igned to intermeddle with, or, in any re&s;pects, change the civil e&s;tabli&s;hments of mankind. His kingdom, he expre&s;sly tells us, <HI>is not of this world.</HI> He &s;uffered Princes and Potentates to remain where they were; and left men to decide all matters of controver&s;y with re&s;pect to them, by the principles of rea&s;on and their civil laws or forms of government. He inculcated le&s;&s;ons of obedience to them; and wrought a miracle to pay tribute, when he knew that he &s;hould have been excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE religion of JESUS is replete with the wi&s;e&s;t maxims of civil polity, and inculcates them by the mo&s;t inviting rewards, and the mo&s;t dreadful puni&s;h|ments. To &s;ecure the favor of the Mo&s;t High is to render to &s;ociety the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential advantage. They who rule for GOD, who protect his Church, who are animated by his religion, and exemplify in their pub|lic admini&s;trations, and in the private walks of dome&s;|tic retirement, all the virtues of the Chri&s;tian, and they only, can govern with &s;afety to them&s;elves, and advantage to their con&s;tituents. They will mutual|ly &s;hare with the people the ble&s;&s;ings which they diffu&s;e. Under their wi&s;e councils and determina|tions

religion will flouri&s;h. This will make them honorable and re&s;pectable to them&s;elves: It will encircle them with a glory, which the breath of mor|tals will not be able to take away; and rai&s;e them to &s;eats of immortal honor.</P>
<P>CIVIL rulers are the guardians of the people; they will not &s;eparate the public weal from their own private happine&s;s, nor feel &s;atisfied with their labors, unle&s;s they are directed to the advantage of the community. They will derive the highe&s;t plea|&s;ure in the admini&s;trations, which &s;ecure to tho&s;e under their charge their rights and liberties, civil and &s;acred.</P>
<P>RULERS, who u&s;e their influence to &s;et a&s;ide the maxims of go&s;pel morality and piety, forego the im|portant and numerous advantages, which might ac|crue to them&s;elves from the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ppy di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ubjects, governed by the pure&s;t motives, and trained to the mo&s;t virtuous conduct.

<P>THE &s;ocial intere&s;t is a vain and wild fancy with|out religion. Let religion, and the virtues which it inculcates be bani&s;hed, and the ba&s;es of public order and private tranquility are at once &s;ubverted; the hu|man character lo&s;es its dignity; and has nothing to recommend it above the herd of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>NOTHING can le&s;&s;en the beauty, ob&s;cure the bright|ne&s;s, or tarni&s;h the glory of that morality, which the go&s;pel inculcates. To conform to this, he who is called to the arduous duty of ruling over MEN MUST BE JUST, RULING IN THE FEAR OF GOD. Parents mu&s;t be wi&s;ely tender and indulgent towards their children, and children mu&s;t be obedient to their parents. Ma&s;ters mu&s;t be gentle, and &s;er|vants diligent. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be watchful, and the people to whom they mini&s;ter mu&s;t take heed how they receive and hear, and hold fa&s;t and repent. It teaches all, in what&s;oever &s;tate we are, to be content, to be grateful for every enjoyment, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive under all the &s;orrows of human life&punc; to give our hearts to him who hath made, &s;u&s;tained, and re|deemed us; and keep our&s;elves un&s;potted from the world.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="031126_0024_0FEBE416C45AF998">
IF the laws of religion be viewed in their &s;piritu|ality, extent, and tendency, rea&s;on and equity will be found their ba&s;is. And, if he, who is rai&s;ed to the &s;eat of power, pays no regard to this morali|ty, he has acquired only a fancied elevation, a &s;or|ry pre-eminence above his brethren. But he, who is &s;incere and diligent in his endeavours faithfully to di&s;charge the duties of his &s;tation, hath an honor, which enmity and malevolence, with all their poi&s;on, will not be able to blacken.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ocial and public, as well as private life, there is an in&s;eparable connexion between holine&s;s and happine&s;s; between &s;in and mi&s;ery. From the attributes of the Mo&s;t High and merciful Ruler, the common dealings of his Providence, and the declar|ations of his holy word, we may conclude, that he will ble&s;s, defend and encrea&s;e a virtuous nation, and will leave tho&s;e, who are wicked to &s;uffer the fatal con&s;equences of their own wickedne&s;s. The hi&s;tory of the world is full of examples, that in proportion as public virtue, and an attention to the duties of re|ligion have encrea&s;ed or dimini&s;hed; &s;o the wealth, credit and powers of all &s;tates and empires have flouri&s;hed or decayed. <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, but &s;in is a reproach to any people.</HI> Rulers, therefore, who are the mini&s;ters of GOD, are in duty bound to lend their aid to promote religion.</P>

IF &s;uch as we have de&s;cribed be the character of the good Ruler, and &s;uch the happy con&s;equences of his admini&s;trations; it is highly important that none but men of this de&s;cription be inve&s;ted with authority.</P>
<P>THE duty, the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of a free peo|ple require, that they examine the characters of tho&s;e, who are propo&s;ed as candidates for places of public tru&s;t. It is important that they revere the laws of religion; that its &s;ublime principles influence their hearts, and its pure morals be exhibited in their lives. The wicked and profligate, who ridicule or di&s;believe the religion of the Bible, who &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of its &s;acred truths, cannot &s;afely be entru&s;ted with the liberties of the people: they may greatly op|pre&s;s them, wantonly &s;port with the lives of their &s;ubjects, unju&s;tly wre&s;t from them the property, which they have earned by their hone&s;t and indu&s;|trious labors, and riot upon the &s;poils of their hap|pine&s;s.</P>

They &s;teadily pur&s;ue the peace and pro&s;perity of their country; encourage a regard for the precepts of religion, which have the be&s;t influence on its happine&s;s, and enforce them by a corre&s;ponding example.
