<BIBL>PSALM 77, VERSE 20,</BIBL>
<Q>THOU LEDDEST THY PEOPLE LIKE A FLOCK, BY THE HANDS OF MOSES AND AARON.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOW various and tran&s;cendent are the excel|lencies of the &s;acred writings! They combine all the different &s;pecies of literary compo&s;ition in their highe&s;t perfection, and con&s;ecrate them to the mo|ral improvement, the pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s of man. They furni&s;h the be&s;t &s;ummary precepts, models, and incentives, for producing the good citizen and &s;tate&s;man, for effecting an orderly and pro&s;perous &s;tate of things in the civil and tempora|ry combinations of this world: Whil&s;t their pri|mary object is, to prepare men for the far nobler, the everla&s;ting community of the ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations are eminently illu&s;trated by that part of the in&s;pired volume, which relates to GOD'S ancient people. The words ju&s;t recited, look back to the infancy of that favoured nation. They introduce the GOD of I&s;rael under the beau|tiful
<PB N="6" REF="024841_0005_0FCD6A92475355F0">
figure of a Shepherd leading his flock; which expre&s;&s;es in a very lively and endearing manner, the &s;ingular tenderne&s;s and care, with which Heaven had conducted that people from the bond|age of Egypt, to the promi&s;ed Canaan. The latter part of the ver&s;e, pre&s;ents the &s;ubordinate and united agency of Mo&s;es and Aaron, in accompli&s;h|ing that memorable &s;eries of events. The&s;e two celebrated characters had been early and clo&s;ely linked together, by the ties of nature, of religion, and of common &s;ufferings. They were afterwards united by the more awful bond of a divine com|mi&s;&s;ion, which con&s;tituted them Plenipotentiaries from JEHOVAH, the King of I&s;rael, to the Egyp|tian Court, which employed them as in&s;trumental &s;aviours of their oppre&s;&s;ed countrymen, as their guides and protectors through the dangers of the wilderne&s;s, and the prime Mini&s;ters of their civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity. Whil&s;t the one was Chief Magi&s;trate in the Commonwealth, the other was High Prie&s;t, or fir&s;t officer in the Church. And the in&s;titution and combined influence of the&s;e two orders in that community, were a mo&s;t wi&s;e and &s;alutary provi&s;ion both for its public and indivi|dual happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE divine appointment, then, and concurrent agency of the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical ruler, in lead|ing the ancient people of GOD, naturally invite our attention to the importance and utility of political and religious guides in a chri&s;tian &s;tate, and to that union of affection and of exertion for the common good, which ought to characterize and cement them. To explain and enforce this union, with|out confounding the Church and the Common|wealth,
<PB N="7" REF="024841_0006_0FCD6A93C457BD78">
or blending the different provinces of their re&s;pective Mini&s;ters, is a truly delicate ta&s;k. The Speaker hopes, however, that his well-meant en|deavours to explore &s;uch a field, before an audience &s;o re&s;pectable, will not be deemed either vain, or impertinent to the occa&s;ion. He flatters him&s;elf that the &s;ea&s;onable and momentous complexion of the &s;ubject, which cannot fail to &s;trike every intel|ligent eye, will procure to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and ap|plication of it a candid reception.</P>
<P>THIS joyful anniver&s;ary collects our civil and &s;a|cred leaders from various parts of the State, to one con&s;ecrated &s;pot. It unites them, methinks, into one happy brotherhood. It brings them to|gether to the altar of GOD, their common Founder, Ma&s;ter, and Judge. It makes them joint partakers in a kind of yearly fe&s;tival, &s;acred to liberty and to religion&mdash;a fe&s;tival, which &s;eems to renew and to &s;eal mutual friend&s;hip, and their harmonious ar|dent affection to the general intere&s;t. Is it not congenial then with the &s;pirit of the day, as well as decent and u&s;eful on other accounts, that the&s;e two orders &s;hould &s;ometimes be the united object of its public addre&s;&s;es from the word of GOD; that their reciprocal influence, and their conjunct ope|ration to the common good, &s;hould be clearly de|fined, and forcibly urged?</P>
<P>UNDER the &s;olemn impre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e ideas, we will endeavour to mark out the two different provinces of Mo&s;es and Aaron, or of the Ruler and the Prie&s;t; the beneficent influence of each upon the public welfare; and the &s;everal ways, in which they may
<PB N="8" REF="024841_0007_0FCD6A9756DFCA08">
and ought to befriend and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in lead|ing the people of GOD.</P>
<P>THE di&s;criminating genius of the two depart|ments may be thus defined. The one has for its immediate object, the temporal intere&s;t of man|kind; the other, their &s;piritual and everla&s;ting. The one aims to regulate their outward behaviour, &s;o far as to re&s;train them from injuring one an|other or the public, and engage their contributions to the common welfare: The other contemplates the due regulation of the heart, as well as the overt|acts which i&s;&s;ue from that &s;ource. The one en|forces its addre&s;&s;es by &s;anctions merely civil and worldly; the other by motives which chiefly re&s;|pect the &s;oul and the life to come.</P>
<P>LET us now turn our attention to the important and happy influence of each department upon the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THE importance of &s;uch an officer in &s;ociety as the ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> Magi&s;trate, is immediately &s;een and felt by all. It grows out of the pre&s;ent weakne&s;s and cor|ruption of mankind. It is &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;ocial feelings belonging to our frame, joined with a &s;en&s;e of mutual dependence and common danger. Ac|cordingly, when &s;uch officer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;pirit of his &s;tation, and with intelligence and fidelity pur|&s;ues its leading de&s;ign, the effects on the communi|ty will be equally benign and diffu&s;ive. A ruler of this character, like the central orb of the planetary world, enlightens and animates, cements and beau|tifies the whole political &s;y&s;tem. With a &s;kilful, &s;teady, yet gentle hand, he moulds a confu&s;ed ma&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="024841_0008_0FCD6A984CC02900">
of di&s;cordant materials into one regular and har|monious compound, and holds it together with a &s;ilken, yet invincible chain. By a &s;trictly righte|ous, equal, and paternal admini&s;tration, he &s;preads the ble&s;&s;ings of ju&s;tice, freedom, tranquillity, pub|lic and private pro&s;perity, through all cla&s;&s;es of the people. The advantages of &s;uch a magi&s;tracy tran&s;cend de&s;cription. To u&s;e the delicate and &s;plendid figures of in&s;piration. It re&s;embles "the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth, even a morning without clouds; like the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth by clear &s;hining after rain."</P>
<P>BUT it is needle&s;s to expatiate on this branch of our &s;ubject. The beneficent influence of good civil rule &s;tands confe&s;&s;ed to the eye of rea&s;on. It is in&s;cribed, as with a &s;un-beam on the face of our happy country. It has been delineated with &s;u|periour ability and addre&s;s, on the&s;e anniver&s;ary &s;olemnities.</P>
<P>LET us then direct our attention to the other object before us, namely, the importance and be|nefit to &s;ociety, of the CHRISTIAN PRIESTHOOD, or of public religious in&s;tructors. To &s;et this point in a ju&s;t and ea&s;y light, let us con&s;ider at large, the nece&s;&s;ity of religion to the well-being of a commu|nity, and then inquire, what are the be&s;t means of diffu&s;ing and maintaining it.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of religion to public order and happine&s;s, has been generally acknowledged by di&s;|cerning minds in all countries and ages, yea, by en|lightened infidels and athei&s;ts. But a &s;et of phi|lo&s;ophers
<PB N="10" REF="024841_0009_0FCD6A9A4BE6BCD8">
and free-thinkers, who boa&s;t of their &s;u|periour rea&s;on and liberality, have appeared on the &s;tage, in the&s;e days of modern refinement, who have employed all the powers of metaphy&s;ical &s;o|phi&s;try and licentious ridicule to &s;hake the founda|tions of religion: And &s;ome of them have even denied its political importance and utility, and have propo&s;ed in its &s;tead a kind of philo&s;ophical or civil morality, as fully competent to the pur|po&s;es of general order and &s;ecurity. A &s;y&s;tem of ideas, or at lea&s;t of practical feelings, very &s;imilar to this, &s;eems growing into fa&s;hion in various parts of the American Union; a &s;y&s;tem, which con&s;iders all religious principles, ob&s;ervances and in&s;tructors, as the remains of old monki&s;h igno|rance, &s;uper&s;tition and bigotry, or the antiquated offspring of worldly policy, begotten in the early and ruder &s;tages of &s;ociety; but which are wholly un&s;uitable and u&s;ele&s;s, if not a heavy tax upon the public, in this more enlightened and mature period of human affairs! But let us meet the&s;e refined politicians upon their own ground; and a&s;k them, what they have to &s;ub&s;titute in the room of religion, as an adequate prop to their own favourite &s;cheme of morality.</P>
<P>WILL they &s;ay, that civil laws and in&s;titutions, planned with wi&s;dom, and executed with vigour, will completely an&s;wer the purpo&s;e? But the&s;e human provi&s;ions can embrace only the vi&s;ible actions of the &s;ubject. They can prevent or puni&s;h tho&s;e offences only, which may be known and le|gally proved. They con&s;equently, leave out of their juri&s;diction all &s;ecret crimes; as well as tho&s;e numberle&s;s immoralities, which human laws can
<PB N="11" REF="024841_0010_0FCD6A9B9BD1AC70">
never di&s;tinctly define, but which operate as the poi&s;on both of private and &s;ocial felicity. Civil re|gulations proclaim their own incompetency, even in the judicial procedures &s;ubmitted to their autho|rity: For no general rule can accommodate it&s;elf to an infinite diver&s;ity of circum&s;tances: And therefore the aid of religious principle &s;eems ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply the defect. This will teach the Legi&s;lator to con&s;truct, and the Judge to interpret and apply the laws, upon &s;o ju&s;t and li|beral a plan, as will pre&s;ent the be&s;t advantages in every ca&s;e, for di&s;covering the truth, and &s;o for protecting the innocent, as well as cha&s;ti&s;ing the wilful offender. This will induce a con&s;cienti|ous, a filial and generous obedience, on the part of the &s;ubject, to the rea&s;onable authority of the Ma|gi&s;trate and the laws. At the &s;ame time it will prevent a cowardly, degrading &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the claims and mea&s;ures of imperious de&s;pots, or a fawning, idolatrous, pro&s;tration at the feet of a dignified fellow-worm. In &s;hort, whil&s;t human laws puni&s;h criminal actions, it is the glory of reli|gion to prevent them, to tear up the roots from which they grow. Whil&s;t law is deaf and unrelent|ing to the cries of penitent guilt, religion pardons and comforts the &s;uppliant, returning offender, and hereby encourages and fortifies his purpo&s;es and efforts of future obedience. Whil&s;t the one enfor|ces &s;trict ju&s;tice only, the other inculcates the whole train of gentle and beneficent virtues: It in&s;pires an intercour&s;e of humane, generous kindne&s;s, and grateful attachment and fidelity, between the higher and lower cla&s;&s;es in &s;ociety; an intercour&s;e, which like the vital fluid diffu&s;es chearful health through the whole political body. Thus civil in&s;ti|tutions
<PB N="12" REF="024841_0011_0FCD6A9CC462ECC0">
and mea&s;ures, even in their be&s;t &s;tate, re|quire the &s;uccours of religion, to &s;upply their de|ficiencies, to &s;often their rigour, to enforce and to &s;weeten their ob&s;ervance.</P>
<P>"BUT a &s;en&s;e of honour, the de&s;ire of e&s;teem and prai&s;e, and fear of their oppo&s;ites, joined to the efficacy of &s;alutary laws, will certainly form a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity of the general order and wel|fare." We an&s;wer, the good influence of this principle will not bear a compari&s;on with that of religion. For the prai&s;e or cen&s;ure of the world, exerts its principal force within a very &s;mall cir|cle, upon more &s;plendid or public characters; whil&s;t the great majority of the people, concealed under humble roofs, feel little of its efficacy. But religion applies its &s;timulating or withholding in|fluence to the ignorant, the ob&s;cure, and the weak; as well as to the wi&s;e, the noble and the mighty. The world does not be&s;tow its palm, till men have almo&s;t reached the goal; but religion applauds and cheri&s;hes the fir&s;t virtuous de&s;ire, intention, or, effort. The world often mi&s;takes in its judgment of characters and actions; but religion places an unerring witne&s;s and judge in our very bo&s;oms. In a word, even the e&s;teem of men in the ca&s;e be|fore us, ultimately derives its force from religion. For if the &s;ocial or moral virtues of mankind, were once &s;tripped of the lu&s;tre, the &s;tability, and the maje&s;ty, which religious principles communicate, the re&s;pect paid to them, would &s;uffer an imme|diate &s;hock: The idea of honour and di&s;grace, connected with their performance or omi&s;&s;ion, would be greatly enfeebled: And the opinion of the world, left without a &s;teady guide, would grow
<PB N="13" REF="024841_0012_0FCD6A9F20C432E8">
too fluctuating and capricious, to re&s;train or to actuate human conduct.</P>
<P>"BUT the connexion between the intere&s;t of the public and of individuals, lays a &s;ufficient bond upon the latter to contribute to the order and wel|fare of the former." We reply, this connexion is not always &s;o immediate and &s;triking, as to in|fluence the unthinking, the poor and the wretched, to pay homage to the order and beauty of the &s;o|cial &s;y&s;tem, whil&s;t there is nothing for them indivi|dually, but apparent deformity and mi&s;ery; whil&s;t tho&s;e very principles and rules, which &s;ecure har|mony to the public, wealth, power and magnifi|cence to &s;ome of their fortunate neighbours, &s;eem to bind them down to perpetual poverty and toil; and when a violation of the&s;e laws promi&s;es in&s;tant relief or benefit to them&s;elves, and at the &s;ame time, perhaps threatens no direct injury to the community at large. There are &s;ome ca&s;es too, in which the more opulent ranks, or the governing powers of the State, may with rea&s;on con&s;ider the public intere&s;t and their own, as &s;eparate objects: And if their minds are not enlightened and regu|lated by religion, they will often view the&s;e two intere&s;ts as di&s;tinct, when they really unite. They will al&s;o be &s;upremely inclined to pur&s;ue private advantage, at the expence of every rival claim. In &s;uch in&s;tances, what is there effectually to re&s;train &s;uch elevated characters from &s;acrificing the public, at the &s;hrine of their adored, though paltry idol? There is nothing which promi&s;es a &s;ure and per|petual guard again&s;t the&s;e evils, but religious prin|ciples&punc; the &s;entiment of a Deity, and of a future &s;tate of recompence, early planted in the minds,
<PB N="14" REF="024841_0013_0FCD6AA088779270">
and deeply rooted in the hearts both of the high and the low.</P>
<P>"BUT &s;ome infidel and irreligious characters have conducted well in a &s;ocial and political view." We an&s;wer, religious ideas early taught and imbib|ed, will &s;ecretly influence the con&s;cience and prac|tice, long after the under&s;tanding has begun to que&s;tion, and even to reject the arguments, on which they are founded. Be&s;ides, a habit of order and propriety in conduct, once formed, is not ea&s;i|ly &s;ubdued by after &s;peculations; e&s;pecially when an adherence to it is connected with the marks of public e&s;teem and favour, or enforced by the com|manding motive of private intere&s;t. Not to add, that there are &s;ome, who affect a &s;uperiority to the common ma&s;s of mankind, by talking like infi|dels, who yet feel them&s;elves con&s;trained to think and act, in many in&s;tances, like vulgar believers.</P>
<P>"BUT if religion be the main prop of &s;ocial or|der, why does not the latter always relax and de|cline with the former?" The an&s;wer is, religion &s;till keeps her hold of men, through the medium of natural con&s;cience, of early habit, and &s;ome aw|ful controlling impre&s;&s;ion of a future retribution, even when their hearts do not feel her transform|ing power, nor their lives di&s;play her peculiar and mo&s;t attractive charms. If then religious princi|ples have &s;uch &s;alutary effects on &s;ociety, even when their influence is feeble, and when they manage the human mind by the inferiour and precarious han|dle of fear; what would be their fruits, if they reigned in full glory, and commanded the free and &s;teady &s;ervices of love? If love to GOD and men,
<PB N="15" REF="024841_0014_0FCD6AA204BAC508">
which is the life of religion, pervaded all cla&s;&s;es in the community, what a copious and excellent har|ve&s;t would it quickly produce! This would en&s;ure the univer&s;al practice of all tho&s;e virtues, which nouri&s;h and exalt a nation; whil&s;t it directly pro|moted the intere&s;t and comfort of all ages, condi|tions and &s;tations; it would, as the great law of moral attraction, draw the affections and efforts of all to one common center, the good of the whole. Mu&s;t not &s;uch a &s;pirit and conduct immediately advance the re&s;pectability, the vigour, the tempo|ral and &s;piritual pro&s;perity of a people? Mu&s;t they not draw down the approving &s;miles, the guardian care, the rewarding munificence of the SUPREME Ruler of nations? On the other &s;ide, mu&s;t not ir|religion, and its natural offspring, vice, equally tend, both by a direct and a judicial operation, to disjoint, to enfeeble, to de&s;troy a community? Does not the univer&s;al experience of public bodies from the beginning to this day, &s;eal the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations? Is it not one mighty practical demon&s;tration of the &s;alutary fruit of piety and vir|tue, or the baneful influence of their oppo&s;ites, upon the order, the liberty, the general welfare of nations?</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of religion to public happine&s;s be|ing &s;ufficiently proved, an intere&s;ting que&s;tion ari&s;es; what are the be&s;t means of diffu&s;ing and maintaining in a community this precious and fundamental ble&s;&s;ing? This inquiry brings up to view the importance of public religious in&s;tructors. The political nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an order of men, di|rectly re&s;ults from that of religion it&s;elf, when com|pared with the ignorance, dulne&s;s, and depravity
<PB N="16" REF="024841_0015_0FCD6AA622A38DC0">
of the human mind, the &s;piritual and &s;ublime na|ture of religious truths, the want of lei&s;ure as well as ability in the bulk of mankind, for &s;tudying and familiarizing them, and the influence of &s;urround|ing objects of worldly cares and amu&s;ements to in|tercept their view, to efface or weaken their impre&s;|&s;ion. In this dark and impure region," how apt are even the mo&s;t contemplative and virtuous cha|racters to lo&s;e &s;ight of moral and &s;piritual objects, and to get out of the &s;phere of their attractive and regulating influence! How greatly then do we all need the friendly voice of STATED MONITORS, to recal our forgetful, wandering feet; and to enlight|en and warm our hearts afre&s;h with the divine principles and motives of religion! Tho&s;e in high &s;tation need to be frequently reminded, that there is a BEING above them, to whom they are account|able, equally with the lowe&s;t of the people. Per|&s;ons of great genius and learning, require to be often admoni&s;hed that their obligations to &s;erve GOD and the public, are proportioned to their &s;u|periour talents. The worthy and good in &s;ociety, need a frequent and lively inculcation of tho&s;e truths, which tend to nouri&s;h and fortify their vir|tues, to enliven and extend their efforts of u&s;eful|ne&s;s. How much more needful, then is public re|ligious in&s;truction to the inferiour members of the community, to the numerous cla&s;s of laborious poor, to the gro&s;&s;ly ignorant, the carele&s;s, and the vicious! Without this, how &s;hall they obtain a competent knowledge, or an abiding practical im|pre&s;&s;ion of their various relations and duties to GOD, to man, to civil &s;ociety?</P>

IN this view, the public wor&s;hip of the DEITY, and &s;tated in&s;tructions in religion and morality, ap|pear as nece&s;&s;ary and beneficial to the State, as they are to the &s;ouls of individuals: And the in&s;titution of a WEEKLY SABBATH, devoted to tho&s;e purpo&s;es, is the offspring of profound and generous policy, if viewed merely in its a&s;pect upon our pre&s;ent &s;o|cial condition. For the decent and united ob&s;erva|tion of it, by the Members of each Corporation, is, an eminent mean of promoting u&s;eful knowledge, civilization and good neighbourhood; of &s;trength|ening the cords both of political and chri&s;tian union; of bringing &s;ea&s;onable re&s;t and refre&s;hment to the body and mind, after the fatigues of world|ly care and toil; and of keeping alive in the minds of all ranks, an awful commanding &s;en&s;e of DEITY, of moral and religious obligation: Agreeably, the public benefits of this in&s;titution are di&s;tinctly vi&s;i|ble on the face of tho&s;e communities, which care|fully &s;upport and ob&s;erve it; whil&s;t the contrary features equally di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e, which de&s;pi&s;e or neglect it.</P>
<P>THE preacher cannot do full ju&s;tice to this part of his theme, or to his own profe&s;&s;ion as a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, without adding, that the CHRISTIAN RELIGION, properly &s;tated and enforced by its teachers, has a peculiarly favourable influence upon the pre&s;ent &s;ocial &s;tate of mankind: For, it is the volume of revelation only, that fully illu&s;trates and confirms, and with due authority pre&s;&s;es, tho&s;e great religious principles, which we have &s;hown to be the ba&s;is of virtue and of order. At the &s;ame time it &s;uperadds a new &s;cheme of truth, &s;uited to the lap&s;ed &s;tate of mankind, which at once encourages,
<PB N="18" REF="024841_0017_0FCD6AA92F0B8888">
directs, a&s;&s;i&s;ts and con&s;trains to univer&s;al goodne&s;s; it pre&s;ents the DEITY, in the full orbed lu&s;tre of his perfections; it di&s;plays the matchle&s;s philanthropy, the generous expiation and interce&s;&s;ion of his Son; it offers and conveys the needed &s;uccours of his &s;pirit; it a&s;certains and de&s;cribes the future joys and &s;orrows of immortality. Mu&s;t not the&s;e di&s;|coveries, &s;uitably realized&punc; powerfully tend to check tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion&mdash;to kill the &s;eeds of vice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to pro|duce, to enoble, and improve every branch of a vir|tuous character? The moral &s;y&s;tem too, which chri&s;tianity builds upon the&s;e principles, is an emi|nent friend to our pre&s;ent felicity. For it incul|cates the mo&s;t extended, the mo&s;t active, the mo&s;t &s;elf-denying benevolence; it links us to the great brotherhood of man; yea, it unites us to the uni|ver&s;e, to eternity, and to GOD, the head and &s;um of both. It levels all the haughty feelings of &s;uperiour rank or abilities, and places true great|ne&s;s in humble, conde&s;cending, elevated goodne&s;s. By this, as well as by con&s;tantly pointing us to tho&s;e two great levellers, death and an endle&s;s retribu|tion, it introduces a kind of generous republican equality among the different orders and conditions in &s;ociety. It equally regards and &s;ecures the in|tere&s;t of all the members of the community, by that great rule of equity, "whatever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them." By pre&s;enting the &s;ame motives and rewards of virtue to the weak and the &s;trong, and by urging both to &s;ecret acts of goodne&s;s, from a regard to the approving eye, and final recompence of the SUPREME JUDGE; it provides a &s;teady &s;upport, a con&s;tant opportunity, a univer&s;al engagement to the practice of virtue. We may add, it regulates
<PB N="19" REF="024841_0018_0FCD6AAB5C8266A0">
and refines tho&s;e important &s;ocial connexions and duties, the conjugal, parental and filial, in a manner highly favourable to the order and happine&s;s of human &s;ociety. In a word, the &s;pirit of our reli|gion, is uniting and peaceable: It is loyal, patrio|tick, and free: It is the life and &s;upport of good government and of rational liberty. Even the po&s;itive, ceremonial rites of chri&s;tianity, properly admini&s;tered, are important out-works, which guard the public welfare: For by &s;triking upon the &s;en&s;es and imaginations of men, they bring affecting truths with peculiar force to their hearts, and hereby operate to produce a decent and regular outward deportment.</P>
<P>WHAT an engine of public u&s;efulne&s;s, then, does the chri&s;tian in&s;titution put into the hands of its Mini&s;ters! And how important is it to the com|mon good, that &s;uch an order of men &s;hould be &s;pread out over the whole community! What un|&s;peakable aid may they afford to, as well as receive from, the civil Magi&s;trate! Whil&s;t the people at large reap a plentiful harve&s;t from the united la|bours of both! Which brings us more di&s;tinctly to point out out the &s;everal ways in which the Ruler and Prie&s;t may and ought to combine their influ|ence, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, in leading the people of GOD.</P>
<P>WE mean not to advocate &s;uch a union or co|operation of the two orders, as involves a heteroge|neous mixture of civil and &s;piritual objects; as places the Magi&s;trate upon CHRIST'S throne, in the Church, and inve&s;ts the chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter with the honors and the powers of the State: Such motley
<PB N="20" REF="024841_0019_0FCD6AAC92F84708">
alliances are the offspring of political and prie&s;tly ambition, aided by equal cunning; are the main pillar both of civil and religious tyranny; and the &s;ource of infinite mi&s;chiefs to the intellectual and moral character as well as the temporal condition of mankind. They infect the be&s;t religion under Heaven, its Profe&s;&s;ors and Mini&s;ters, with the &s;pirit of this world, with a proud, cruel, per&s;ecuting and immoral di&s;po&s;ition. As a celebrated writer ob&s;erves, "per&s;ecution is not an original feature in any religion; but is always the &s;trongly mark|ed feature of all law, religion, or religions e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by law. Take away the law-e&s;tabli&s;hment, and religion re-a&s;&s;umes its original benignity. In Ame|rica a Catholic Prie&s;t is a good citizen, a good cha|racter, and a good neighbour; an Epi&s;copalian Mini&s;ter is of the &s;ame de&s;cription; and this pro|ceeds from there being no law-e&s;tabli&s;hment in Ame|rica."</P>
<P>BUT whil&s;t we execrate &s;uch trea&s;onable con|&s;piracies between Rulers and Prie&s;ts, again&s;t the deare&s;t rights and intere&s;ts of man, we may con&s;i&s;|tently recommend to the two orders, a liberal and patriotick combination for the general good. There is indeed, in many re&s;pects, a natural alliance between intelligent, virtuous Magi&s;trates and Mi|ni&s;ters, in a free and chri&s;tian State.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;t, the Magi&s;trate may and ought to co|operate with the chri&s;tian in&s;tructor, by throwing the weight of his per&s;onal example and private influence into the &s;cale of chri&s;tian piety and virtue. The ef|ficacy of example, when arrayed in all the &s;plen|dour of high office, is not to be de&s;cribed. As re|ligion
<PB N="21" REF="024841_0020_0FCD6AAE04D3BF90">
adds grace and dignity to the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation, &s;o &s;he derives a &s;uperiour charm and maje&s;|ty from it.</P>
<P>WHEN the great political characters in a com|munity, give their uniform &s;anction to religion, by exhibiting her faire&s;t features in their daily de|portment; when they openly revere the name, the &s;abbaths, the temple, and all the &s;acred in&s;titutions of the Mo&s;t High; when they liberally and zealou&s;ly contribute to the &s;ettlement and &s;upport, the reputation and &s;ucce&s;s of a learned and virtuous Prie&s;thood, to the exten&s;ive propagation of chri&s;tian knowledge, and to the pious education of the ri&s;|ing age; when they are eminent patterns of vir|tue them&s;elves, and are careful to cheri&s;h and hon|our it in others; how un&s;peakably do &s;uch exam|ples confirm and extend the credit and influence of religion! What animation and confidence, what &s;uperiour re&s;pectability and &s;ucce&s;s, do they give to its teachers! What authority and energy mu&s;t the inward con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and open lu&s;tre of &s;uch virtue impart to Rulers them&s;elves, in their official pro|ceedings; e&s;pecially tho&s;e which have for their ob|ject, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of wickedne&s;s, and the en|couragement of the oppo&s;ite intere&s;t! Which leads us to ob&s;erve, that Rulers e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">icaciou&s;ly concur with chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters, when they carry the &s;pirit of religion into their public conduct: When all their political mea&s;ures are regulated by the everla&s;ting maxims of natural ju&s;tice, of chri&s;tian equity and benevolence: When they accordingly di&s;tribute the burdens, apply the re&s;ources, fulfil the engage|ments and di&s;charge the debt of the public, with the &s;crupulous fairne&s;s, the exact economy, the a&s;|&s;iduous
<PB N="22" REF="024841_0021_0FCD6AB02CCBE540">
attention required by tho&s;e rules, in the &s;imilar tran&s;actions of private citizens: When they dete&s;t and &s;corn the idea of &s;anctioning by their public authority, any mea&s;ure, which they would blu&s;h to avow or to practi&s;e in their individual ca|pacity: In &s;hort, when the whole &s;y&s;tem of their public conduct appears to be prompted and guided by a SUPREME regard to the example and laws, the approbation and honour of the infinite RULER and the good of his moral family: What a glori|ous atte&s;tation is here of the reality, the command|ing force of religious obligation! Such a train of political mea&s;ures is pregnant with various and almo&s;t inconceivable good. It inculcates various &s;entiments upon the public mind, with all the au|thority and force of the highe&s;t, the mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous, and unequivocal example. It al&s;o directly and efficiently contributes to the general pro&s;peri|ty: For it proceeds upon principles, which are as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary and conducive to &s;ocial union and happine&s;s, as the laws which govern the mate|rial world, are to the harmony and welfare of na|ture.</P>
<P>FURTHER, the Magi&s;trate may greatly &s;trengthen the chri&s;tian Teacher, by directing his public atten|tion to the advancement of religion and virtue as an immediate and primary object; by &s;o arrang|ing his mea&s;ures for the increa&s;e of temporal good, as to render them in the be&s;t manner &s;ub&s;ervient to that which is &s;piritual and eternal; by enacting and executing laws for the prevention or puni&s;h|ment of profanene&s;s and immorality; by promot|ing virtuous characters to offices of honor and u&s;e|fulne&s;s; by neglecting and di&s;pi&s;ing the vicious;
<PB N="23" REF="024841_0022_0FCD6AB151C823A8">
by le&s;&s;ening and removing the temptation to ini|quity; by augmenting and multiplying the encou|ragements to goodne&s;s; by giving birth and efficacy to public and private means of learning, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to rational piety; by effectually providing for the &s;upport and decent ob&s;ervance of public religious wor&s;hip and in&s;truction &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, as we have &s;een, to the virtue, the civilization, and happine&s;s, of the community. Such a legal provi&s;ion for the maintainance of reli|gious in&s;titutions, obviou&s;ly falls within the pro|vince of the Magi&s;trate, on account of their tran&s;|cendent importance to civil government and &s;ocie|ty: Nor does &s;uch provi&s;ion adju&s;ted upon an equal and liberal plan, make the lea&s;t approach to a political e&s;tabli&s;hment of any particular religious profe&s;&s;ion, nor con&s;equently invole any inva&s;ion of the prerogative of CHRIST, or the &s;acred rights of con&s;cience. On the other hand,</P>
<P>SECONDLY. The chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter may and ought to &s;trengthen the hands of the civil Ruler. If he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es tho&s;e qualities of head and heart, which &s;uit his benevolent and comprehen&s;ive office, he mu&s;t have the mo&s;t tender and ardent feelings for the intere&s;t of the State, as well as the Church. He mu&s;t perceive an important connexion between them, as well as the friendly a&s;pect of the chri&s;tian doctrine upon both. He mu&s;t con&s;equently feel a double &s;timulus to a prudent and faithful di&s;charge of his tru&s;t. He therefore endeavours, both in his public mini&s;trations, and in his private conver&s;a|tion and example, &s;o to repre&s;ent and enforce the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, as that it may, under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, have its full effect upon the character and
<PB N="24" REF="024841_0023_0FCD6AB285FD7E38">
condition of mankind, in reference to this world and the next. He takes particular care not to make this beneficent and peaceable religion, an engine of civil or &s;piritual tyranny, confu&s;ion, malignant &s;trife, or in any re&s;pect, an in&s;trument of increa&s;|ing, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening human depravity and wretchedne&s;s. He feels him&s;elf peculiarly united to the worthy Magi&s;trate, by the ties of per&s;onal e&s;teem and public affection. He &s;tudies that his whole deport<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nt re&s;pecting the Rulers and the laws, may expre&s;s and promote a &s;pirit of decent &s;ubjection and obedience, and he enforces &s;uch &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion by all the authority and &s;anction of religion. His &s;ocial intercour&s;e with his family and flock, his daily prayers in private and in public, tend to kin|dle and to nouri&s;h the &s;entiments of loyalty and patrioti&s;m. He loves to mention in the ears of the ri&s;ing race, the names and &s;ervices of patriot Rulers, of eminent public benefactors; and hereby to charm the tender mind to the love of virtue, of country, of mankind, as well as to a due venera|tion for, and grateful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch Mini&s;ters of divine benevolence. His public di&s;cour&s;es too, all tend either directly or remotely, to form his hearers into good citizens and &s;ubjects, as well as holy chri&s;tians. That &s;uch a reciprocation of &s;ervi|ces between the two orders, falls within the line of propriety and important duty, is too obvious to the eye of di&s;cernment, to require a formal illu&s;tra|tion.</P>
<P>IT is with great &s;atisfaction, that we appeal to the hi&s;toric page of our own country, for a &s;triking comment upon the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e. Our fathers were led out of the hou&s;e of bondage in
<PB N="25" REF="024841_0024_0FCD6A52AEA5C1D8">
Britain, into the wilderne&s;s of America, and plant|ed here, as in the land of promi&s;e, by the &s;ame di|vine Shepherd, who led ancient I&s;rael from deep oppre&s;&s;ion and mi&s;ery, to the joys of freedom and plenty. The &s;ame good &s;pirit, which in&s;pired Mo&s;es and Aaron, to undertake and conduct &s;o ar|duous an enterprize, evidently guided and animat|ed the leaders in that great attempt, which gave birth to New-England. The &s;ame union of friend|&s;hip, of coun&s;el and exertion in the public cau&s;e, which characterized the Hebrew Lawgiver and High-Prie&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;hed the political and religious Fathers of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The rulers of the State, were at the &s;ame time Members and pillars of the Church. The religion which they thus &s;olemnly profe&s;&s;ed, was the rule of their public and private conduct, and the advancement of its intere&s;ts, a main object of both. For this purpo&s;e, they readi|ly co-operated with the &s;chemes and endeavours of worthy clergymen, and contributed their be&s;t ef|forts for their comfort, reputation and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE advice and influence of the prie&s;thood were likewi&s;e ever at hand, to aid and &s;ucceed the opera|tions of the Magi&s;trate, and to promote the civil, as well as religious intere&s;ts of the people. It is grant|ed, indeed, that our ance&s;tors carried this union of Church and State, to an unwarrantable length. But this was not their peculiar fault: It was the complexion of the age. And &s;hall we, their chil|dren, who owe &s;o much to their generous &s;ervices and &s;ufferings, &s;hall we, like undutiful and cur&s;ed <HI>Ham,</HI> take plea&s;ure in expo&s;ing their nakedne&s;s? No, my fellow-citizens; whil&s;t we &s;pread a veil of filial, piety over their imperfections, let us
<PB N="26" REF="024841_0025_0FCD6AB7CA9BE970">
with the mo&s;t grateful emotions, celebrate that united agency of Mo&s;es and Aaron, which, under GOD, laid &s;uch early and noble foundations of free|dom and order, of &s;cience and religion; which in the feeble infancy, and great poverty of the &s;ettlement gave birth to a public &s;eminary of learning; a &s;emi|nary, which from its foundation, to this day, has borne on its front the united in&s;cription of the Ruler and the Prie&s;t, in the names of its Founders, and Benefactors, of its Governors and Sons! But pa&s;&s;ing over the intermediate &s;tages of our hi&s;tory; you will permit me mode&s;tly to a&s;k, does not the in&s;cription ju&s;t mentioned, appear very con&s;picuous on the face of our late glorious revolution? Did not the&s;e two orders remarkably unite their efforts to keep the public mind in a po&s;ture of vigilance, of information, of patriotic ardour? In tho&s;e times which tried men's &s;ouls, did not the public prayers and di&s;cour&s;es, the private infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence and example of the great body of the clergy, firmly and &s;ucce&s;s|fully co-operate with the civil and military mea|&s;ures of the country? Did not the &s;ame zealous concurrence of the two departments, procure the adoption of the excellent con&s;titution of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, and of the pre&s;ent federal &s;y&s;tem, which gives union, order, and happine&s;s to America? Did not the &s;ame virtuous and un&s;haken combination emi|nently mark that perilous and alarming cri&s;is, which a few years &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed over this Common|wealth? Do not the&s;e &s;triking facts evince, that the &s;pirit of the clerical office at lea&s;t, in this enlight|ened and free country, is an important friend to the liberty, government and happine&s;s of &s;ociety? On the other hand, it becomes us gratefully to ac|knowledge the &s;upport which religion and its Mi|ni&s;ters
<PB N="27" REF="024841_0026_0FCD6AB947B86508">
have received from the civil government of this State, from the authority and example of &s;ome of the fir&s;t political characters in it; the additional reputation and &s;ucce&s;s which they have in&s;trument|ally derived from that &s;ource; and the con&s;equent face of &s;uperiour union and order, civilization and virtue, which adorns a great part of our community. The&s;e advantages would &s;trike us with much great|er force, were we allowed to contra&s;t our &s;ituation in the&s;e re&s;pects, with that of &s;ome other parts of the Union: But decency forbids the invidious compari&s;on.</P>
<P>WHEN we look over this numerous and re&s;pect|able a&s;&s;embly, a cloud of witne&s;&s;es ru&s;hes upon our &s;en&s;es and hearts, in &s;upport of the ideas now ad|vanced.</P>
<P>OUR eye is fir&s;t caught by the CHIEF MAGIS|TRATE of this Commonwealth, who has had a large &s;hare in the great political drama, that has been act|ed on the &s;tage of the new world, and covered it with glory. The pre&s;ence of his Excellency re&s;trains the lips of delicacy from paying him a formal tri|bute of prai&s;e. But while his di&s;tingui&s;hed politi|cal &s;ervices are engraven on every American bo&s;om, ju&s;tice to a different part of his character, con|&s;trains us to ob&s;erve, that he has ever treated reli|gion, its in&s;titutions and Mini&s;ters, with a re&s;pect becoming the enlightened, con&s;i&s;tent patriot, and Ruler, in a chri&s;tian State. The clergy within his juri&s;diction, feel the animating influence of his at|tention and patronage, and wi&s;h him in return, a large experience of the comforts of our divine religion, amid&s;t that trying &s;cene of bodily infirmity, with
<PB N="28" REF="024841_0027_0FCD6ABAF5BAAF38">
which he has &s;o long been afflicted. It is al&s;o our united prayer to GOD, that his Excellency may ever form his whole private and public conduct upon the divine model propo&s;ed in the life and precepts of the chri&s;tian lawgiver. That &s;o his per|&s;onal example and official mea&s;ures may unite their influence to &s;pread piety and virtue as well as every temporal ble&s;&s;ing, through the community. To this, he will feel him&s;elf urged by every motive, which can operate upon a heart of &s;en&s;ibility; in particular, by the intere&s;ting pro&s;pect of death and endle&s;s retribution, to which the highe&s;t earthly god is equally bound with the lowe&s;t of his &s;ub|jects. May con&s;cious fidelity chear the &s;olemn hour of di&s;&s;olution, in&s;pire boldne&s;s before the de|ci&s;ive tribunal, and be crowned with &s;uperiour glory in the kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>HIS Honour, the Lieutenant-Governour, merits our tribute of re&s;pect, on account of that di&s;tin|gui&s;hed union of political wi&s;dom, patriotic virtue, and chri&s;tian piety, which has long dignified his character. Notwith&s;tanding the eminence of his reputation among the civilians of the age, he has not been a&s;hamed of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, but has long been inli&s;ted under that de&s;pi&s;ed, but heavenly banner. May he &s;till continue an ornament and pillar, both of the Church and Commonwealth, till his hoary head &s;hall come down to the grave in peace.</P>
<P>THE Honourable Council claim our regards, on account of their important &s;hare in the executive department, and worthy per&s;onal qualities, which pointed them out to the &s;uffrages of their enlight|ened
<PB N="29" REF="024841_0028_0FCD6ABD432F46F0">
fellow-citizens. Whil&s;t their elevation to this office reflects on them a ray of glory, it obliges them to a corre&s;pondent dignity of &s;entiment and conduct: It invites them to a noble imitation of the governing wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and mercy of HIM, who is the wonderful Coun&s;ellor, the King of righteou&s;ne&s;s and of peace. It particularly calls them to advi&s;e and con&s;ent to the appointment of &s;uch characters only, to interpret and execute the laws, as are exemplary them&s;elves for the ob&s;erv|ance of human and divine injunctions, and endow|ed with talents and di&s;po&s;itions &s;uited to the im|portant tru&s;t. In this way they may un&s;peakably promote the civil and moral intere&s;ts of all parts of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>THE Gentlemen who compo&s;e the two Branches of the Honourable Legi&s;lature, will permit our con|gratulations on the fre&s;h mark of e&s;teem and confi|dence, with which their con&s;tituents have honoured them. They will likewi&s;e remember that the tru&s;t, with which they are charged, is very &s;olemn and momentous; that it is rendered &s;till more awful, by the declarations and oaths, with which they have recently entered on its execution. As we cannot doubt their &s;incerity in tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions and appeals to Heaven, we entertain a chearful hope that all their tran&s;actions on this day and through the year, will be regulated by the excellent princi|ples of that religion, and of tho&s;e civil con&s;titutions which they have publicly taken for their guide. We rea&s;onably expect that all their laws and pro|ceedings will be &s;o many branches growing out of the &s;tock of equal ju&s;tice and comprehen&s;ive bene|volence; that they will be &s;trongly marked with
<PB N="30" REF="024841_0029_0FCD6ABEC98921B0">
the &s;ame integrity, virtue and honor, which &s;uit and adorn the rational and chri&s;tian character in a private capacity. They will ever remember that the &s;ame practical principles, mu&s;t form the ba&s;is both of public and individual happine&s;s and glory; and that the policy of tho&s;e who would rear he fabrick of national pro&s;perity upon a different foundation is equally unphilo&s;ophical and iniquit|ous. As human art, in order to produce certain u&s;eful effects mu&s;t conform to the principles of na|ture, or the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of its great Architect; &s;o the politician mu&s;t build the order and welfare of &s;ociety upon tho&s;e moral principles and connex|ions, which the &s;ame ALMIGHTY RULER, has in|&s;tituted in the rational &s;y&s;tem. If he act an oppo|&s;ite part, he virtually, attempts a new creation: Yea, like the man of &s;in, he exalts him&s;elf above all that is called GOD; for it is the glory of the DEITY him&s;elf, though he be an ab&s;olute ALMIGH|TY SOVEREIGN, that he cannot govern upon any other plan than that of inviolable truth, ju&s;tice, and goodne&s;s; that he cannot lie to any of his &s;ubjects, or trifle with their rea&s;onable petitions, expectations or claims. It will be the glory of our Rulers, to copy after this divine original. No idea therefore of omnipotence or uncontrolled Sove|reignty, will be permitted to infect their delibera|tions and deci&s;ions; but their whole conduct, as it re&s;pects particular citizens, the Commonwealth in general, and the great American Republic, will, we tru&s;t, exhibit a fair picture of hone&s;t, enlarged and Federal policy.</P>

<PB N="31" REF="024841_0030_0FCD6AC03022FB98">
circle of politicks; as you, have all this day profe&s;&s;|ed the chri&s;tian belief, and many of you are com|plete vi&s;ible members of the Redeemer's family; you will feel under the mo&s;t &s;acred ties, to devote the &s;uperiour powers and advantages of your pre|&s;ent &s;tations, to the chri&s;tian intere&s;t. Whil&s;t there|fore you tenderly guard the rights of con&s;cience, and afford equal protection to all peaceable citi|zens, you will make and enforce every needful provi&s;ion for the general diffu&s;ion of religious and moral &s;entiments, and for the maintenance and ob|&s;ervation of tho&s;e chri&s;tian and literary in&s;titu|tions, which are requi&s;ite to that end. Among &s;uch in&s;titutions, the neighbouring Univer&s;ity has a di&s;tingui&s;hed claim to your liberal patronage. It has been one of the grand nur&s;eries of civiliza|tion, liberty, good government and religion. Our very exi&s;tence, as a re&s;pectable community, is, un|der GOD, greatly derived from that &s;ource. Filial gratitude then, as well as every &s;entiment of pub|lic virtue, pre&s;s our Rulers to nur&s;e and cheri&s;h this their ancient parent, with a tender and gener|ous care.</P>
<P>IN a word, let me re&s;pectfully call upon all our civil officers, in every department, to con&s;ecrate their authority, influence and example to the great|e&s;t good of the community. You, Gentlemen, col|lectively con&s;idered, are the moving and regulating principle of the whole political machine. If you jointly and &s;trenuou&s;ly pur&s;ue a virtuous train of conduct, it will operate like a powerful charm upon all parts of the &s;y&s;tem, and call up a new crea|tion of beauty, virtue and happine&s;s. Let it then be your fir&s;t ambition and endeavour, to make
<PB N="32" REF="024841_0031_0FCD6AC1DCB2D510">
mankind wi&s;er, better and happier; to rai&s;e up the drooping head of virtue; to tread down irreligion and vice; to enlarge the empire of knowledge and righteou&s;ne&s;s; to augment as much as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;um of created good, and of creating and redeem|ing glory.</P>
<P>AND &s;ince the advancement of the&s;e great inter|e&s;ts lies very much between you and the &s;tanding teachers of religion, let gentlemen in the&s;e different orders cultivate a friendly and patriotic alliance, by all the methods which prudence and generous virtue &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>YE venerable leaders of our civil and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal tribes; how many and how forcible are the ties which bind you together! In this land of politi|cal and religious freedom, you both derive your election to office from one &s;ource; you are fellow-labourers in one great and benevolent cau&s;e; you are important members of one civil body, and by vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ion and &s;acred obligation, of one chri&s;tian family; in the due performance of your &s;everal offices, you di&s;play the &s;ame leading excel|lent talents and virtues, and mutually give and re|ceive the mo&s;t important &s;upport. Certainly then, there can be no &s;trife, no jealous di&s;tance between you; for ye are brethren. We congratulate the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, on the liberal and virtuous union, which at this moment &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between you, and which is particularly exemplified in tho&s;e nu|merous laudable incorporations, which embrace many of your fir&s;t characters; and which have for their object, the intere&s;ts of &s;cience, of arts, of edu|cation, of humanity, of chri&s;tian knowledge and
<PB N="33" REF="024841_0032_0FCD6AC54B4FC850">
piety. To perpetuate this union and render it &s;till more operative to the general good, and not the low &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or vanity of exalting and &s;trength|ening his own profe&s;&s;ion, con&s;idered as a &s;eparate intere&s;t, has been the preachers governing motive in this di&s;cour&s;e; and with a view to the &s;ame grand object, he mode&s;tly &s;ubmits to the candour of both departments, a few monitory hints, &s;ugge&s;ted by the pre&s;ent a&s;pect of &s;ociety and of religion.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place: Our leading characters in the civil and the literary line, will feel the peculiar im|portance, at this degenerated period of animating their clerical brethren, in every method dictated by wi&s;dom and virtue; and particular, by encourag|ing them to calculate their public mini&s;trations up|on principles of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s. They will con&s;ider, that many of us are connected with &s;ocieties, which are chiefly compo&s;ed of the labour|ing and more illiterate cla&s;s; that the&s;e peculiarly need the privileges of a weekly &s;abbath and public religious in&s;truction; and that many of them re|quire very plain, and very pungent applications, in order to enlighten their ignorance, to rou&s;e their &s;tupidity, or to check their vicious career. Our chri&s;tian patriots, therefore far from de&s;pi&s;ing, will generou&s;ly aid tho&s;e teachers, who frequently en|deavour, by all the methods of familiar, pathetic, or alarming addre&s;s, to reach and refine the&s;e rougher parts of the community. The enlarged know|ledge and experience of our learned civilians will al&s;o in&s;pire &s;entiments of candour towards the prie&s;thood, in regard to that variety of &s;peculation, of gifts, and addre&s;s, by which it is diver&s;ified; they will view this diver&s;ity as naturally re&s;ulting
<PB N="34" REF="024841_0033_0FCD6AC6C41D8B08">
in great mea&s;ure from the &s;pirit of free inquiry and improvement, which characterizes the pre&s;ent day. They will con&s;ider too, that it furni&s;hes public teachers &s;uited to the various capacities, ta&s;tes and prejudices, and all the grades of charac|ter and condition, which at this period mark the face of &s;ociety. They will further con&s;ider, that the operation of republican equality and religious freedom, will &s;ometimes introduce a chri&s;tian in|&s;tructor not perfectly agreeable to the reli&s;h or the &s;peculations of a few &s;uperiour members of a cor|poration, but perhaps very acceptable and benefi|cial to the general ma&s;s of the people. In &s;uch ca&s;es, does not a regard to &s;ocial order, to equal rights, to the greate&s;t moral and political good, require a ge|nerous and peaceable acquie&s;cence?</P>
<P>ON the other hand&punc; it becomes the clergy at this day &s;tudiou&s;ly to hold up their office, and the reli|gion which they teach, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectable and plea&s;ing light. A &s;pecial attention to this object, is rendered important, by the pre&s;ent improved &s;tate of &s;ociety; by the learning and politene&s;s, which adorn many of our religious a&s;&s;emblies; by the rapid progre&s;s of loo&s;e &s;entiments and manners, and the con|&s;equent di&s;reli&s;h or contempt of chri&s;tian doctrines, in&s;titutions, and teachers. To check the&s;e &s;pread|ing evils it becomes the &s;acred order to pay great attention both to the private and public duties of their function; it becomes them, in the perform|ance of the latter, to di&s;play a force of rea&s;oning, a propriety of thought, of method and expre&s;&s;ion, a decency of &s;tyle and addre&s;s, which may at once bear down the &s;coffs and the &s;ophi&s;try of liberti|ni&s;m, ju&s;tly plea&s;e the ta&s;te of literary refinement,
<PB N="35" REF="024841_0034_0FCD6ACAACE66668">
and at the &s;ame time exhibit the plain, the affection|ate, the evangelical preacher. It becomes them both in their mini&s;trations and per&s;onal example, to repre&s;ent the chri&s;tian in&s;titution and mini&s;try, as friendly to human happine&s;s in both worlds; as breathing a &s;ocial and courteous, a candid and for|bearing, a loyal, uniting, and public &s;pirit; a &s;pi|rit, which whil&s;t it &s;upremely attaches us to the &s;er|vice and rewards of the life to come, cheri&s;hes a proper &s;en&s;ibility of our rights, duties, and enjoy|ments as inhabitants of the earth. It becomes them in every con&s;i&s;tent method, to &s;upport the ci|vil intere&s;ts of the community, the re&s;pectability of its Rulers, and the efficacy of its Laws. And whil&s;t law &s;peaks to the public ear, in one uniform, inflexible tone, it is ours, my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, to bring home the addre&s;&s;es of religion to the bo&s;oms of individuals; and by a pertinent and forcible application of her peculiar truths and &s;anctions, to &s;eize their con&s;ciences, their imagina|tions, their hearts; to po&s;&s;e&s;s and command their inmo&s;t feelings. By this proce&s;s, under the in|fluence of the all creating &s;pirit; we are fir&s;t to mould them into good men, and then by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition into good citizens, rulers and &s;ubjects. Above all, let us ever keep in our own realizing view, and en|deavour to enforce upon our people, the primary, the infinitely weighty object of our religion and mini|&s;try, viz. the &s;piritual, everla&s;ting &s;alvation of immor|tal beings, and the glory of GOD and his SON, &s;hining forth in the wondrous contrivance, and accompli&s;h|ment of it. Whil&s;t our Rulers are pu&s;hing forward our temporal pro&s;perity and glory, let us labour to e&s;tabli&s;h and to complete that glory, by a corre&s;|ponding advancement of this mo&s;t important ob|ject. Into this channel let us endeavour to draw
<PB N="36" REF="024841_0035_0FCD6ACC1311CA48">
all the civil and literary, as well as religious advan|tages, which come within our reach. Let the unit|ed efforts of the clergy and laity, be e&s;pecially em|ployed in diffu&s;ing chri&s;tian knowledge and virtue, through tho&s;e va&s;t territories of our country, who&s;e poverty, and remote &s;ituation have precluded the &s;tated enjoyment of religious in&s;titutions; and in promoting a more general and effectual attention to the private means of education, in various parts of the Commonwealth. By &s;uch a union of pub|lic exertion, our leading characters in Church and State, will re&s;emble the two olive-trees, which the Prophet &s;aw in vi&s;ion, emptying their golden oil into the candle&s;tick of Zion.</P>
<P><HI>Fellow-Citizens of this great A&s;&s;embly,</HI></P>
<P>I felicitate you and our common country, on the natural, civil and religious advantages, by which we are &s;o eminently exalted; and e&s;pecially on the pro&s;perous train of our national affairs, under the au&s;pices of indulgent Heaven, and its favourite Mini&s;ter, the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. When we mention this beloved citizen and bene|factor of America, every bo&s;om pre&s;ent, feels the endearing and forcible illu&s;tration, which his ex|ample gives to the leading &s;entiment of this di&s;|cour&s;e. For the charm of his piety, of his public and private virtue, as well as political wi&s;dom, has been a principal cement of our national union, and &s;o a prime &s;ource of all its attendant ble&s;&s;ings. What then is wanting to complete the glory and happine&s;s of our country? Nothing but the gene|ral prevalence of the &s;ame excellent &s;pirit; a &s;pirit of &s;ublime virtue, corre&s;ponding to the natural grandeur and extent of America, and to its noble
<PB N="37" REF="024841_0036_0FCD6ACDF2A78B68">
con&s;titutions of government and religion. Virtue enlightened and invigorated by political and chri&s;|tian knowledge, is eminently the &s;oul of a republic. It is nece&s;&s;ary to direct, to enliven, to guard the election of its Rulers, and to &s;ecure to them, the generous confidence, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and co-operation of the people. It is peculiarly requi&s;ite in a com|munity like ours, &s;pread out over &s;uch an immen&s;e continent, divided by &s;o many local governments, prejudices and intere&s;ts: A people &s;o circum&s;tanc|ed, can never be firmly and durably united, under one free and popular government, without the &s;trong bands of religious and moral principle, of intelli|gent and enlarged patrioti&s;m. Liberty planted in &s;uch a &s;oil, will be perpetually tending to unbridled licentiou&s;ne&s;s, di&s;tracting jealou&s;ies, and popular confu&s;ion. Let us then &s;et up a vigilant guard again&s;t the&s;e encroaching evils. Let us not imagine that the exerci&s;e of civil liberty, con&s;i&s;ts in ignorant or envious abu&s;e of public characters and mea|&s;ures; nor that religious freedom will ju&s;tify care|le&s;s neglect or wanton contempt of the truths, the ordinances, and mini&s;ters of that religion, which was &s;ent down from Heaven to guide us, to pre|&s;ent and future happine&s;s. Though we are not ac|countable to the civil Magi&s;trate for our religious &s;entiments and wor&s;hip; yet we certainly are to the DEITY; and he has given us no liberty in this enlightened country, either to think with Dei&s;ts and Sceptics, or to live like Athei&s;ts; nor will the pro&s;titution of his Sabbaths, to idlene&s;s or amu&s;e|ments in defiance of human and divine laws, pa&s;s in his account for a mark of &s;uperior politene&s;s or liber|ality. In oppo&s;ition to the&s;e wicked, but too modi&s;h abu&s;es of liberty, let us remember that energetic gov|ernment,
<PB N="38" REF="024841_0037_0FCD6AD16E554078">
is the guardian of freedom, and that re|ligion, e&s;pecially the chri&s;tian, is the pillar of both. Let us then properly re&s;pect, &s;upport, and concur both with our civil and religious Mini&s;ters. Let us exerci&s;e the mo&s;t &s;crupulous care in the election of both, and be rationally &s;atisfied, that their heads and hearts, their principles and morals, comport with the &s;pirit of their &s;everal offices. But having cho&s;en them, let us treat their per&s;ons and admini&s;|trations with that confidence and honour, which become a wi&s;e and magnanimous people, and which may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, give the greate&s;t ef|fect to their benevolent labours.</P>
<P>FINALLY: As the crown of all, let us become pious towards GOD, humble and obedient believers in his SON, con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the govern|ment and laws of our country, &s;ober, frugal, and diligent in our &s;everal employments, ju&s;t and kind to one another, unitedly and zealou&s;ly attached to the great intere&s;ts of America, and of the whole human fraternity. Then we &s;hall hold out an in|viting example to all the world, of the propitious operation of a free government; we &s;hall encour|age and accelerate the progre&s;s of rea&s;on, and of liberty, through the globe. Already has the new world diffu&s;ed the light and warmth of freedom acro&s;s the Atlantic, into the old; which has given birth to a &s;urpri&s;ing and glorious revolution. Let us be nobly ambitious, by our future conduct, to feed and extend the generous flame; and thus to realize the wi&s;hes and hopes of all benevolent &s;pi|rits in Heaven and earth. Let us e&s;pecially labour and pray, that the&s;e political &s;truggles and changes, may, under the divine agency, introduce new and
<PB N="39" REF="024841_0038_0FCD6AD2C40B81D8">
brighter &s;cenes of chri&s;tian knowledge and piety, till the whole world &s;hall be covered with divine glory and human bli&s;s. And may we in particular, after having filled our departments in &s;ociety here, with u&s;efulne&s;s and honor, be united to the more glorious community of the righteous; where the official di&s;tinctions of Mo&s;es and Aaron, are known no more; where all the followers of the LAMB, &s;hall form one royal prie&s;thood, one mighty com|bination of perfect and happy immortals; and GOD the originial &s;ource of being and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, &s;hall be ALL in ALL.</P>
