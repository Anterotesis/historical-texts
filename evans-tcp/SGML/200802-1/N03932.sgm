<P>_WENT on Monday and re|turn'd this Evening from <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> which I have &s;een with no &s;mall Satis|faction. Surely there is a Difference, even in this Life, between tho&s;e that &s;erve the LORD and tho&s;e that &s;erve him not.&mdash; All other Places of the Colony &s;eem to be like <HI>Egypt,</HI> where was Darkne&s;s; but <HI>Eben|ezer,</HI> like the Land of <HI>Go&s;hen,</HI> wherein was great Light. For near Four Miles I walk'd in almo&s;t one continued Field, with a mo&s;t plentiful Crop of Corn, Pea&s;e,

Potatoes, &amp;c. growing upon it, all the Produce of a few Months Labour. But GOD gives the Labourers a peculiar Ble&s;&s;ing. They are unanimous, the Strong help the Weak, and all &s;eem hearty for the common Good. In a few Years the <HI>Saltzburghers,</HI> I believe, will be a flouri&s;hing People. Their Land is tolerably good and lies very near the River. They already provide Food, and, ere long, will be capable of providing Raiment for them&s;elves. I &s;hall &s;end them up Cotton, Spinning-Wheels and a Loom, to begin a Manufactory; and next Year, I hope, their own Land will produce enough Flax, Cotton, &amp;c. to carry it on. I had &s;weet Communion with their Mini&s;ters. Our Si&s;ter <HI>Orphan-Hou&s;e</HI> there is ble&s;&s;ed by their Means; and Ye&s;terday was &s;et apart as a Day of Thank&s;giving, for &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tances lately &s;ent the dear Lambs from <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Savannah.</HI> The People &s;eem very grate|ful.

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, July</HI> 3. Set out Ye&s;terday Morning about One a Clock, and reach|ed Mr. <HI>Bryan</HI>'s Plantation about Ten. Stayed and dined comfortably together; wrote a few Letters; rode thro' extream Heat, put in and lay at a Planter's Hou&s;e by Rea&s;on of the Thunder, Lightning and Rain. Breakfa&s;ted this Morning at Mr. <HI>Bee</HI>'s at <HI>Pon-pon</HI>; prayed; talked of the Things of GOD, and was enabled to hold out, notwith&s;tanding the Weather was exceeding hot, till I came to <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> about Eighty Miles from <HI>Beaufort.</HI> Here again my Spirits were much rai&s;ed, and my Heart comforted by a Packet of Letters from the <HI>Northward,</HI> giving me Account how the Word of the LORD run and was glorified in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and other adjacent Places: <HI>The LORD's Name be prai&s;ed from the Ri&s;ing up of the Sun to the going down of the &s;ame.</HI></P>

Went to Church Morning and Evening, and heard the Commi&s;&s;ary preach as virulent and unorthodox, incon&s;i&s;tent Di&s;cour&s;e as ever I heard in my Life.

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, July</HI> 15. I appeared, accord|ing to the Citation, at the appointed Hour and Place. There were very many Spectators; and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary, The Rev. Mr. <HI>Guy,</HI> The Rev. Mr. <HI>Mellichamp,</HI> The Rev. Mr. <HI>Roe,</HI> The Rev. Mr. <HI>Orr,</HI> &s;at as Judges: They received me with good Manners; and after the Clerk of the Court had ta|ken a Minute of their Appearing, the Commi&s;&s;ary tender'd to me a Paper, de|&s;iring my An&s;wer to tho&s;e Articles, but I refu&s;ed taking it, till I was &s;atisfied of the Authority of the Court in Que&s;tion, adding, do you think I would in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur a Premunire of doing what I could not an&s;wer? (or Words to that Effect) He then &s;aid, they would proceed to cen&s;ure; upon which, I reminded them of the Ex|ample of the Magi&s;trates, who exceeded their Authority, in condemning and &s;courging St. <HI>Paul</HI>; being a <HI>Roman,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="004846_0019_100E00B064C58748">
unheard. At this one of the Clergy &s;neer'd; but the Commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ary replied,
<Q>We &s;hall not go beyond o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Power, or &s;courge you.</Q>
After a &s;hort Debate the Commi&s;&s;ary &s;ent his Apparitor to his Hou&s;e for his Commi&s;&s;ion, in order to give me Satisfaction. In about a Quar|ter of an Hour he return'd, with &s;everal Bundles of Papers, out of which the Com|mi&s;&s;ary fir&s;t produced his Commi&s;&s;ion to act as Commi&s;&s;ary from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London.</HI> I read and approved of it: But at the &s;ame Time de&s;ired to be &s;atisfied of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>'s Authority in this Province, not finding the Royal Au|thority underwritten, as mention'd in his publick Citation: Upon this a Latin Commi&s;&s;ion without a Seal, was order'd to be read by the Clerk of the Court. I objected, That it was in Latin contrary to our late Act, ordering every Thing to be in Engli&s;h; and not well under&s;tand|ing the Clerk as he read it, I de&s;ired the Peru&s;al of it my&s;elf, which was granted. I read it with an audible Voice; and after reading it, I objected, That tho' there might be a general Power given to the Bi&s;hop, to exerci&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;dic|tion in this Province; yet the Extent of that Power was to be determined by par|ticular Acts of A&s;&s;embly. I farther urged,
<PB N="21" REF="004846_0020_100E00B2A2A78948">
That a Court of this Nature was intirely unpre&s;idented in <HI>America</HI>: that I belong|ed to <HI>Georgia,</HI> a different Province, and was here only as an Itinerate. I al&s;o ad|ded, That my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> tho' I preached in the Fields for &s;ome Months, never attempted to exerci&s;e &s;uch Autho|rity again&s;t me. The Commi&s;&s;ary repli|ed, Tho' I belonged to <HI>Georgia,</HI> yet I had committed Irregularities <HI>here,</HI> and there|fore came under his Cognizance; and that what he had to lay to my Charge might be Crimes of a different Nature.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with my Objections, he order'd the Clerk to minute down, That I contumaciou&s;ly contemned the Autho|rity of the Court. But I de&s;ired that Expre&s;&s;ion might be &s;oftned, declaring from my Heart, That what I did, pro|ceeded from a real Scruple concerning their Authority, urging the Example of King <HI>Charles,</HI> who, before he made An|&s;wer to his Accu&s;ers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;i&s;ted on knowing the Authority his Judges had to call him to an Account. I further objected, That the Commi&s;&s;aries in <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> were mere Cyphers, That the <HI>Tru&s;tees,</HI> to my Knowledge, que&s;tion'd the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>'s having any Juri&s;|diction in the&s;e Parts; and that the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> acting as Ordi|nary,
<PB N="22" REF="004846_0021_100E00B4CD1359E0">
had &s;ummoned his Clergy lately to meet him as &s;uch, which accordingly they did. I therefore upon the whole, humbly de&s;ired, as a Favour from the Court, that I might have till to Morrow Nine a Clock, the Time to which the Court was adjourned, to inform my&s;elf of the Extent of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction in this Province, a&s;&s;uring them, that upon find|ing their Authority valid, I would im|mediately an&s;wer to any Interrogatories, and would be ready to receive any Sen|tence they could with Ju&s;tice pa&s;s upon me. Tho' at my fir&s;t a&s;king he &s;aid, He had indulged me too far already; yet, after &s;ome Con&s;ideration, Mr. Commi&s;&s;a|ry ordered the Clerk to raze out the for|mer Minute, and to record, That upon my &s;crupling the Authority of the Court I was indulged my Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Our LORD was plea&s;ed to fulfil his Promi&s;e made to tho&s;e that &s;hould be cal|led before Rulers and Governors for his Name-Sake. My Soul was full of Peace. I pitied, but did not feel the lea&s;t Emo|tion of Re&s;entment again&s;t my Judges. The People behaved pretty quiet; but &s;ome broke out into a Laughter, &s;ome|thing irregular, when I &s;aid, the Com|mi&s;&s;aries in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI> were but Cyphers. This I di&s;approved
<PB N="23" REF="004846_0022_100E00B65E2B82C0">
of, and checked immediately. After the Court was adjourned and the Commi&s;&s;ary ro&s;e from his Seat, I made my Obei&s;ance and returned to my Lodgings, thinking my&s;elf more highly honour'd, by my LORD, this Morning than in any other Part of my Life. <HI>LORD &s;trengthen me in all my other impending Trials, for thy great Name's Sake.</HI> Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, July</HI> 16. Appeared this Morning at the Hour of <HI>Ten,</HI> and exhi|bited a <HI>Recu&s;atio Judicis,</HI> i. e. my Ex|ceptions again&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ary's being my Judge in this Cau&s;e, having too great Rea&s;on to believe him prejudiced again&s;t me. At fir&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ary refu&s;ed to read it, in&s;i&s;ting to know fir&s;t whether I acknowledged the Authority of the Court? Unwarily I an&s;wer'd, Yes. But upon the Motion of my Advocate, Mr. <HI>Rut|ledge,</HI> I recalled my W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rds and &s;aid, I admitted and &s;ubmitted to an Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Court legally con&s;tituted. One of the Clergy on the Bench would have in|&s;i&s;ted on my fir&s;t An&s;wer. But I told him, It was mean-&s;pirited and beneath a Court, con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e that called them&s;elves Mini&s;ters of JESUS CHRIST, to catch at an Expre&s;&s;ion which I imme|diately corrected. Upon this, the Bench agreed to alter the Minute agreeable to
<PB N="24" REF="004846_0023_100E00B88BDDEB08">
my la&s;t Declaration. The Commi&s;&s;ary then took my Paper, read it to him&s;elf, and &s;aid, he would not accept of it. I then &s;tood up according to Law and &s;aid, I would go and prote&s;t again&s;t all further Proceedings, as null and void, and imme|diately left the Court. Upon Mr. <HI>Rut|ledge</HI> his Advice I returned and declared, That I appealed <HI>apud acta</HI> to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and then withdrew a &s;econd Time.</P>
<P>We had not gone far from the Place of Judicature, but I was called back by the Apparitor and Regi&s;ter. We returned, and at the Commi&s;&s;ary's De&s;ire gave in my Exceptions to be read and filed.</P>
<P>By this Time Mr. Commi&s;&s;ary had gotten one Mr. <HI>Graham,</HI> an Attorney, to appear in Behalf of the Court, who in|&s;i&s;ted on having the Merits of my Excep|tions tried in Court. But, as according to Law, I had referred them to the Ex|amination of Six Arbitrators, three no|minated by me, and three by the Com|mi&s;&s;ary, Mr. <HI>Rutledge,</HI> in my Behalf, prote&s;ted again&s;t all further Proceedings, and again&s;t my appearing at the next Court, till my Reference to Arbitrators was complied with, it being quite impro|bable to imagine, that Mr. Commi&s;&s;ary, who mu&s;t be Judge (if my Exceptions
<PB N="25" REF="004846_0024_100E00BAB3F3F510">
&s;hould be tried by that Court) &s;hould al|low him&s;elf prejudiced.</P>
<P>This <HI>Recu&s;atio Judicis</HI> I exhibited by the Advice of my Friends, not to quibble with or evade the Force or Rigour of any Law what&s;oever, that I might ju&s;tly fall under. For when the Articles of Impeachment were read, I found my&s;elf accu&s;ed only of omitting to read the Com|mon-Prayer in the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Meeting&punc; at &s;uch Times as I preached there. <HI>Oh that my Adver&s;aries may never have any Thing wor&s;e to lay to my Charge!</HI></P>
<P>The Spectators were rather more nu|merous than Ye&s;terday; they behaved quietly, and were much rejoiced to &s;ee my Oppo&s;ers reduced to &s;uch a Dilemma. Well &s;aid the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>the Wrath of Man &s;hall turn to thy Prai&s;e. &mdash; Great GOD, the Remainder of it do thou re&s;train; and for thy own Name Sake deliver me from the Hands of unrea&s;onable Men, who, out of a mi&s;guided Zeal and without Cau&s;e, are mine Enemies!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, July</HI> 17. By Advice of Mr. <HI>Rutledge,</HI> appear'd in Court at the Time of their Meeting, to &s;ee if my Exceptions were admitted to Arbitration or repelled. The Court being open'd, Mr. Commi&s;|&s;ary a&s;ked me, If I was prepared to an|&s;wer the Articles objected again&s;t me?
<PB N="26" REF="004846_0025_100E00BCDD53F328">
I replied, I could give no An&s;wer, till my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onceptions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">were referred to Arbitrators. Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> &s;tood up and &s;poke &s;ome few<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Word's in Vindication of my Ob|jections proving, by a Book of Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Law, That my Proceedings were according to the Rules therein pre&s;cribed</P>
<P>The Regi&s;ter was ordered to read their Rea&s;ons for repelling my Exceptions. Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> endeavoured to enforce, ha|ving fir&s;t laboured to prove the Juri&s;dic|tion. of the Court, and to remove the Appehen&s;ions the Country in general, or Di&s;&s;entels in particular, might entertain concerning the ill Con&s;equences of &s;uch a Court's being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reated. He held on without Interruption for a con&s;iderable Time; but Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> ri&s;ing up to in|validate what he had &s;aid, was &s;topped. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">length therefore, finding my Excepti|ons repelled, I appealed to his Maje&s;ty in the High Court of Chancery, and de|clared all other Proceedings in that Court again&s;t me to be null and void.

And my dear Redeemer, to comfort my Heart, by his good Providence, at my Return to my Lodgings, &s;ent me &s;everal Letters from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI>acquainting me how migh|tily the Word of GOD grew and pre|vailed

in tho&s;e Parts. As al&s;o Mr. <HI>Bolten,</HI> who lately kept an A&s;&s;embly-Hou&s;e, and who&s;e Daughter, not long &s;ince, was con|verted at <HI>Georgia,</HI> wrote me Word, that he had near <HI>Fifty</HI> Negroes now learning to read of him: And further, that the People of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> at their own Ex|pence and Accord, were building a Place for me again&s;t Winter, <HI>One Hundred</HI> Feet long and <HI>Seventy</HI> Foot wide. <HI>LORD, do thou fill it with thy Pre&s;ence, and grant, that all that come thither to wor&s;hip, may wor&s;hip thee in Spirit and in Truth!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 19. After Evening Meeting, was de&s;ired by the Apparitor to come and wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on Mr. Commi&s;&s;ary, who was &s;itting in Court&punc; I went. He de&s;ired me to depo&s;ite <HI>Ten Pounds Sterl.</HI> and to &s;wear, That I would lodge my Appeal within a Twelve-Month. My Lawyer not being pre&s;ent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my Friends were too &s;ollicitous for my Non-compli|ance: But being to leave Town on Mon|day, and finding the Commi&s;&s;ary's print|ed Orders gave him Authority to require it, I took the de&s;ired Oath, promi&s;ed to leave <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> in a Friend's Hands; but withal, moved for a Copy of the Court's Proceedings, which was readily complied with.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="004846_0027_100E00C102200970">The Court being ended, the Commi&s;|&s;ary de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. I a&s;ked him to go my Lodgings. He cho&s;e to walk in a Green near the Church. His Spirit was &s;omething calmer than u&s;ual; but after an Hour's Conver&s;ation we were as far from agreeing as before. He char|ged me with &s;peaking Bla&s;phemy, for &s;aying, That if it was in my Power, I would place him at the Right Hand of GOD. Upon my de&s;iring to know wherein the Bla&s;phemy con&s;i&s;ted: He re|plied, Where then will you put CHRIST? I a&s;ked him&punc; Why he was guilty of that Fault, which he charged me with, viz. In accu&s;ing the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> in general, when he only referr'd to Things wrote or done by me in particular? He an&s;wered, Becau&s;e we were all of one Mind, he &s;uppo&s;ed. When I que&s;tion'd him, Why he ridiculed me for making Grimaces in the Pulpit, when he did not come to hear me? Why, &s;ays he, as I pa&s;&s;ed by one Day, I &s;aw you &s;preading out your Hands. I replied, Did not <HI>Paul</HI> do &s;o when he began to preach? In &s;hort, all his Di&s;|cour&s;e was &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent, and contrary to the Go&s;pel of our LORD, that I was obliged to tell him, That I believed him to be an unconverted Man, an Enemy to GOD, and of a like Spirit with the

<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 20. Preached this Morn|ing as u&s;ual; and went afterwards to Church to hear the Commi&s;&s;ary. His Text was, <HI>Take Heed how ye hear.</HI> At fir&s;t I thought we &s;hould have a peaceable Sermon, e&s;pecially &s;ince we had conver&s;ed before &s;o amicably: but the Gall &s;oon be|gan to flow from his Tongue, tho' not with &s;o much Bitterne&s;s as the la&s;t Sunday. He endeavour'd to apologi&s;e for his Pro|ceedings, condemned all that followed me, and gave all Hopes of Heaven, that ad|hered to him and the Church. In the Evening (tho I went off my Bed to do it, and was carried in a Chai&s;e) the LORD JESUS &s;trengthned me to take my la&s;t Farewel of the dear People of <HI>Charle&s;town.</HI> My Soul was fu ll of Tenderne&s;s for them, and many &s;eem'd to &s;ympathize with me. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD</HI> for &s;ending me once more among them!

One well acquainted with their Circum&s;tances and Manners, told me, more had been annually &s;pent on Po|lite Entertainments, that the Poor's Rate came to.

Sermon being over, I went on Hor&s;e-back to <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Hugh Bryan</HI> lived, and &s;everal followed, hoping I would preach again in the Evening: But here my bodily Strength &s;o failed me, and GOD poured &s;uch ineffable Thir&s;tings&punc; and Hungrings in my Soul after him, that I &s;ometimes hoped he was about to &s;et my impri&s;oned Soul at Liberty. <HI>Surely my GOD then placed me upon Mount Pi&s;gah, and gave me a di&s;tant Pro&s;pect of the Heavenly</HI> Canaan!

His Wife &s;at Weeping by, and Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> lay on a Bed, Groaning in Bitterne&s;s of Soul, under a Sen&s;e of Guilt, and Crying out for an Intere&s;t in CHRIST. I a&s;ked him what cau&s;ed him to fall down Ye&s;terday: He an&s;wered, the Power of GOD's Word. After about half an Hour's Conver&s;ation on the Nature of the New-Birth, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;aving Clo&s;ure with the LORD CHRIST, I kneeled down and prayed with them, and then took my Leave, hoping the LORD would pluck them as Fire-Brands out of the Fire. <HI>Even &s;o,</HI> LORD JESUS.

Many, I believe, fed on JESUS in their Hearts with Thank&s;giving. After the Ordinance was over, the LORD enlarged my Heart, and I prayed as the Spirit gave me Utterance. I went home, much re|fre&s;hed in Soul, but &s;o weak in Body, that I declined going to publick Wor&s;hip in the Afternoon. In the mean while, GOD gave me a fre&s;h &s;upply of Strength.

At fir&s;t he &s;eem|ed a little unwilling, being de&s;irous to know what extraordinary Call I had to preach on Week-Days, which he &s;aid was di&s;or|derly.

We then agreed to make U&s;e of it, at Ten in the Morning and Three in the Afternoon. After this, I went and waited on the Go|vernor, who &s;eemed to be a very plain Man and had a very plain Hou&s;e, which much plea&s;ed me. By Profe&s;&s;ion I think, he is a <HI>Seventh-Day Bapti&s;t</HI>; he is a Man of good Report as to his Conduct and Dealing with the World. After a &s;hort Vi&s;it I returned to take my Leave of Mr. <HI>Honeyman,</HI> and to fetch my Friends, who were at his Hou&s;e, waiting for me. We then went to the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Bour&s;e,</HI> who fir&s;t &s;pake to me when coming out of Church. The Hou&s;e was &s;oon filled with Company. I expounded and prayed with them for about an Hour, and then retired to a Lodging the LORD in his good Providence had provided for me.

When we were within four Miles of the Town, the Governor's Son, and &s;everal other Gentlemen, and one or two-Mini&s;ters, waited at a Gentleman's Hou&s;e to give me the Meeting. They re|ceived me with great Gladne&s;s, and told me many more would have come, had not a large Funeral been in the Town, or if there had been more certain Notice of my Arriving.

He did. How do prove it? Why &s;ays he, our LORD prayed that all might be one, even as thou, Father and I are one. I replied, that was &s;poken of the inward Union of the Souls of Believers with JESUS CHRIST, and not of the outward Church.

&s;aid CHRIST was to make up the Defects of our Righteou&s;ne&s;s. I a&s;ked him if Conver&s;ion was not In&s;tantaneous?

I have not heard of any re|markable Stir in it for the&s;e many Years. Mini&s;ters and People are obliged to con|fe&s;s, that the Love of many is waxed cold. Both, for the Generality, &s;eem'd too much conform'd to the World. There's much of the Pride of Life to be &s;een in their A&s;&s;emblies. Jewels, Patches and gay Apparel are commonly worn by the female Sex. Little Boys and Girls I ob|&s;erved commonly dre&s;&s;ed up in the Pride of Life; and the little Infants that were brought to Bapti&s;m, were wrapped in &s;uch fine Things, and &s;o much Pains ta|ken to dre&s;s them, that one would think, they were brought thither to be <HI>initiated into</HI> rather than <HI>renounce</HI> the Pomps and Vanities of this wiched World.

attended. Several Mini&s;ters complain'd to me of it. I mentioned it in my Ser|mon, and I tru&s;t GOD will &s;tir up the People, more frequently to tread the Courts of the LORD's Hou&s;e. One Thing <HI>Bo&s;|ton</HI> is remarkable for, The external Ob|&s;ervation of the <HI>Sabbath.</HI> Men in Civil Offices have a Regard for Religion. The Governor encourages them; and the Mi|ni&s;ters and Magi&s;trates &s;eem to be more united than in any other Place where I have been. Both were exceedingly civil to me during my Stay. I never &s;aw &s;o little Scoffing, never had &s;o little Oppo&s;i|tion: But one might ea&s;ily fore&s;ee, much Oppo&s;ition will hereafter ari&s;e, when I come to be more particular in my Appli|cation to particular Per&s;ons: For I fear many, many re&s;t in a Head-Knowledge, are clo&s;e Phari&s;ees, having only a Name to live. It mu&s;t needs be &s;o, when the Po|wer of Godline&s;s is dwindled away, and the Form only of Religion is become fa&s;hion|able among&s;t a People.

Mo&s;t of them thanked me for my plain Dealing; but one was offended, and &s;o would more of his Stamp if I was to continue longer in <HI>New-Eng|land</HI>: For unconverted Mini&s;ters are the Bane of the Chri&s;tian Church: And tho' I honour the Memory of that great and good Man Mr. <HI>Stoddard,</HI> yet I think he is much to be blamed for endeavouring to prove that unconverted Men might be ad|mitted into the Mini&s;try.

I preach'd in the Afternoon, and with &s;uch Freedom, that a young Mini&s;ter, who had heard me &s;e|veral Times, told me, I had kept the good Wine until now. As &s;oon as Ser|mon was over, I rode about a Mile, cro&s;|&s;ed a broad Ferry, walked about a Mile and a half, and preached to a thronged Congregation, belonging to old Mr. <HI>Ed|wards,</HI> Father to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>North|ampton,</HI> and, I believe, a true Di&s;ciple of the <HI>LORD</HI> JESUS CHRIST.

In &s;hort, I like <HI>New-England</HI> exceeding well, and when a Spirit of Reformation revives, it certain|ly will prevail more than in other Places, becau&s;e they are more &s;imple in their Wor|&s;hip, le&s;s corrupt in their Principles, and con&s;equently more ea&s;ily brought over to the Form of &s;ound Words, into which &s;o many of their pious Ance&s;tors were de|liver'd. <HI>Send forth, O</HI> LORD, <HI>thy Light and thy Truth, and for thy infinite Mercies &s;ake &s;hew thou ha&s;t a peculiar Delight in the&s;e habitable Parts of the Earth.</HI> Amen. LORD JESUS, Amen.</P>
