<BIBL>I CORINTHIANS, ii. 2.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>I determined not to know any thing among you, &s;ave</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and him crucified.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE per&s;ons to whom the&s;e words were written were the members of the church of Corinth; who, as appears by the foregoing chap|ter, were not only divided into different &s;ects, by one &s;aying, "I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos;" but al&s;o had many among&s;t them, who were &s;o full of the wi&s;dom of this world, and &s;o wi&s;e in their own eyes, that they &s;et at nought the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, and accounted the Apo&s;|tle's preaching fooli&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>NEVER had the Apo&s;tle more need of the wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent, mingled with the innocency of the dove, than now. What is the &s;um of all his wi&s;|dom? He tells them, in the words of the text, "I determined not to know any thing among you, &s;ave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified."</P>
<P>A RESOLUTION this, worthy of the great St. Paul; and no le&s;s worthy, no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for every mini&s;ter, and every di&s;ciple of CHRIST, to make always, even unto the end of the world.</P>
<P>IN the following di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall,</P>
<P>FIRST, Explain what is meant by "not know|ing any thing, &s;ave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified."</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Give &s;ome rea&s;ons why every Chri&s;t|ian &s;hould determine not to know any thing el&s;e. And</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="026477_0003_0FD04FCC8BF7BC68">
THIRDLY, Conclude with a general exhortation to put this determination into practice.</P>
<P>FIRST, I am to explain what is meant by "not knowing any thing, &s;ave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified."</P>
<P>BY JESUS CHRIST, we are to under&s;tand the eternal Son of GOD. He is called JESUS, a Sa|viour, becau&s;e he was to &s;ave us from the guilt and power of our &s;ins; and, like Jo&s;hua, by whom he was remarkably typified, to lead GOD's &s;piritual I&s;rael through the wilderne&s;s of this world, to the heavenly Canaan, the promi&s;ed inheritance of the children of GOD.</P>
<P>HE is called CHRIST, which &s;ignifies anointed, becau&s;e he was anointed by the Holy Gho&s;t at his bapti&s;m, to be a prophet to in&s;truct, a prie&s;t to make an atonement for, and a king to govern and protect his church. And he was crucified, or hung (O &s;tupendous love!) till he was dead upon the cro&s;s, that he might become a cur&s;e for us: for it is written, "Cur&s;ed is every man that hang|eth upon a tree."</P>
<P>THE foundation or fir&s;t cau&s;e of his &s;uffering, was our fall in Adam; in whom, as the living ora|cles of GOD declare, "We all died; his &s;in was imputed to us all." It plea&s;ed GOD, after he had &s;poken the world into being, to create man after his own divine image, to breathe into him the breath of life, and to place him as our repre&s;enta|tive in the garden of Eden.</P>
<P>BUT he being left to his own free will, did eat of the forbidden fruit, notwith&s;tanding GOD had told him, "The day in which he eat thereof he &s;hould &s;urely die;" and thereby he, with his whole po&s;terity, in who&s;e name he acted, became
<PB N="5" REF="026477_0004_0FD04FCE0A54BAC8">
liable to the wrath of GOD, and &s;unk into a &s;pirit|ual death.</P>
<P>BUT behold the goodne&s;s, as well as the &s;everi|ty of GOD! For no &s;ooner had man been convict|ed as a &s;inner, but lo! a Saviour is revealed to him, under the character of the <HI>&s;eed of the woman;</HI> the merits of who&s;e &s;acrifice were then immediate|ly to take place, and who &s;hould, in the fulne&s;s of time, by &s;uffering death, &s;atisfy for the guilt we had contracted; by obeying the whole moral law, work out for us an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s; and by becoming a principle of new life in us, de&s;troy the power of the devil, and thereby re&s;tore us to a better &s;tate than that in which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re at fir&s;t created.</P>
<P>THIS is the plain &s;criptural account of that my&s;|tery of godline&s;s, GOD manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h; and to this our own hearts, unle&s;s blinded by the god of this world, cannot but yield an immediate a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>FOR, let us but &s;earch our own hearts, and a&s;k our&s;elves, if we could create our own children, whe|ther or not we would not create them with a le&s;s mixture of good and evil, than we find in our|&s;elves? Suppo&s;ing GOD then only to have our goodne&s;s, he could not, at fir&s;t, make us &s;o &s;inful, &s;o polluted as we are. But &s;uppo&s;ing him to be as he is, infinitely good, or goodne&s;s it&s;elf, then it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould create any thing but what is like him&s;elf, perfect, entire, lacking nothing. Man then could not come out of the hands of his Maker, &s;o mi&s;erably blind and naked, with &s;uch a mixture of the bea&s;t and devil, as he finds now in him&s;elf, but mu&s;t have fallen from what he was; and as it does not &s;uit with the goodne&s;s and ju&s;tne&s;s of GOD, to puni&s;h the whole
<PB N="6" REF="026477_0005_0FD04FCF8ADB2CC0">
race of mankind with the&s;e di&s;orders merely for nothing; and &s;ince men bring the&s;e di&s;orders into the world with them; it follows, that as they could not &s;in them&s;elves, being yet unborn, &s;ome other man's &s;in mu&s;t have been imputed to them; from whence as from a fountain, all the&s;e evils flow.</P>
<P>I KNOW this doctrine of our <HI>original &s;in,</HI> or fall in Adam, is e&s;teemed fooli&s;hne&s;s by the wi&s;e di&s;puter of this world, who will reply, how does it &s;uit the goodne&s;s of GOD, to impute one man's &s;in to an innocent po&s;terity? But has it not been proved to demon&s;tration, that it is &s;o? And therefore, &s;up|po&s;ing we cannot reconcile it to our &s;hallow com|prehen&s;ion that is no argument at all: for if it ap|pears that GOD has done a thing, we may be &s;ure it is right, whether we can &s;ee the rea&s;ons for it or not.</P>
<P>BUT this is entirely cleared up by what was &s;aid before, that no &s;ooner was the &s;in imputed, but a CHRIST was revealed; and this CHRIST, this GOD incarnate, who was conceived by the Holy Gho&s;t, that he might be freed from the guilt of our origi|nal &s;in; who was born of the Virgin Mary, that he might be the &s;eed of the woman only; who &s;uffered under Pontius Pilate, a Gentile governor, to fulfil the&s;e prophecies, which &s;ignified what death he &s;hould die: this &s;ame JESUS, who was crucified in weakne&s;s, but rai&s;ed in power, is that divine per&s;on, that Emmanuel, that GOD with us, whom we preach, in whom ye believe, and whom alone the Apo&s;tle, in the text, was determined to know.</P>
<P>BY which word <HI>know,</HI> we are not to under&s;tand a bare hi&s;torical knowledge; for to know that CHRIST was crucified by his enemies at Jeru&s;alem, in this manner only, will do us no more &s;ervice,
<PB N="7" REF="026477_0006_0FD0552B4B2C9880">
than to know that Cae&s;ar was butchered by his friends at Rome; but the word <HI>know,</HI> means to know, &s;o as to approve of him; as when CHRIST &s;ays, "Verily, I know you not;" I know you not, &s;o as to approve of you. It &s;ignifies to know him, &s;o as to embrace him in all his offices; to take him to be our prophet, prie&s;t and king; &s;o as to give up our&s;elves wholly to be in&s;tructed, &s;aved and governed by him. It implies an expe|rimental knowledge of his crucifixion, &s;o as to feel the power of it, and to be crucified unto the world, as the Apo&s;tle explains him&s;elf in the epi&s;tle to the Philippians, where he &s;ays, "I count all things but dung and dro&s;s, that I might know him, and the power of his re&s;urrection."</P>
<P>THIS knowledge the Apo&s;tle was &s;o &s;wallowed up in, that he was determined not to know any thing el&s;e; he was re&s;olved to make that his only &s;tudy, the governing principle of his life, the point and end in which all his thoughts, words and actions, &s;hould center.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, I pa&s;s on to give &s;ome rea&s;ons why every Chri&s;tian &s;hould, with the Apo&s;tle, deter|mine "not to know any thing, &s;ave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified."</P>
<P>FIRST, Without this, our per&s;ons will not be accepted in the &s;ight of GOD. "This" (and con&s;equently this only) "is life eternal, to know thee, the only true GOD, and JESUS CHRIST, whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent." As al&s;o St. Peter &s;ays, "There is now no other name given under hea|ven, whereby we can be &s;aved, but that of JESUS CHRIST."</P>
<P>SOME, indeed, may plea&s;e them&s;elves in know|ing the world, others boa&s;t them&s;elves in the knowledge of a multitude of languages; but
<PB N="8" REF="026477_0007_0FD0552CCC884468">
could we &s;peak with the tongue of men and an|gels, or did we know the number of the &s;tars, and could call them all by their names, yet, without this experimental knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified, it would profit us nothing.</P>
<P>THE former, indeed, may procure us a little honour, which cometh of man; but the latter on|ly can render us acceptable in the &s;ight of GOD: for, if we are ignorant of CHRIST, GOD will be to us a con&s;uming fire.</P>
<P>CHRIST is the way, the truth and the life; "No one cometh to the Father, but through him;" "He is the Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world&punc; and none ever were, or ever will be, received up into glory, but by an experimental application of his merits to their hearts.</P>
<P>WE might as well think to rebuild the tower of Babel, or reach heaven with our hands, as to ima|gine we could enter therein by any other door, than that of the knowledge of JESUS CHRIST. Other knowledge may make you wi&s;e in your own eyes, and puff you up; but this alone edifieth, and maketh wi&s;e unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P>As the meane&s;t Chri&s;tian, if he knows but this, though he know nothing el&s;e, will be accepted; &s;o the greate&s;t ma&s;ter in I&s;rael, the mo&s;t letter-learn|ed teacher, without this, will be rejected. His philo&s;ophy is mere non&s;en&s;e, his wi&s;dom mere fooli&s;hne&s;s in the &s;ight of GOD.</P>
<P>THE author of the words now before us, was a remarkable in&s;tance of this; never, perhaps, was a greater &s;cholar, in all what the world calls fine learning, than he: for he was bred up at the feet of Gamaliel, and profited in the knowledge of books, as well as in the Jewi&s;h religion, above many of his equals, as appears by the language,
<PB N="9" REF="026477_0008_0FD0552E4C1016C8">
rhetoric, and &s;pirit of his writings; and yet, when he came to know what it was to be a Chri&s;tian, "He accounted all things but lo&s;s, &s;o he might win CHRIST." And, though he was now at Corinth, that &s;eat of polite learning, yet he was ab&s;olutely determined not to know any thing, or to make nothing his &s;tudy, but what taught him to know JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified.</P>
<P>HENCE, then, appears the folly of tho&s;e who &s;pend their whole lives in heaping up other know|ledge; and, in&s;tead of &s;earching the &s;criptures, which te&s;tify of JESUS CHRIST, and are alone able to make them wi&s;e unto &s;alvation, di&s;quier them|&s;elves in a pur&s;uit after the knowledge of &s;uch things, as when known, concern them no more, than to know that a bird dropped a feather upon one of the Pyrenean mountains.</P>
<P>HENCE it is, that &s;o many, who profe&s;s them|&s;elves wi&s;e, becau&s;e they can di&s;pute of the cau&s;es and effects, the moral fitne&s;s and unfitne&s;s of things, appear mere fools in the things of GOD; &s;o that when you come to conver&s;e with them about the great work of redemption wrought out for us by JESUS CHRIST, and of his being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> propitiation for our &s;ins, a fulfiller of the cove|nant of works, and a principle of new life to our &s;ouls, they are quite ignorant of the whole matter; and prove, to a demon&s;tration, that, with all their learning, they know nothing yet, as they ought to know.</P>
<P>BUT, alas! how mu&s;t it &s;urprize a man, when the Mo&s;t High is about to take away his &s;oul, to think that he has pa&s;&s;ed for a wi&s;e man, and a learned di&s;puter in this world, and yet is left de&s;|titute of that knowledge which alone can make
<PB N="10" REF="026477_0009_0FD05530464174A8">
him appear with boldne&s;s before the judgment-&s;eat of JESUS CHRIST? How mu&s;t it grieve him, in a future &s;tate, to &s;ee others, whom he de&s;pi&s;ed as illiterate men, becau&s;e they experimentally knew CHRIST, and him crucified, exalted to the right-Hand of GOD; and him&s;elf, with all his fine ac|compli&s;hments, becau&s;e he knew every thing, perhaps, but CHRIST, thru&s;t, down into hell?</P>
<P>WELL might the Apo&s;tle, in a holy triumph, cry out, "Where is the wi&s;e? Where is the &s;cribe? Where is the di&s;puter of this world?" For GOD will then make fooli&s;h the wi&s;dom of this world, and bring to nought the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e who were &s;o knowing in their own eyes.</P>
<P>I HAVE made this digre&s;&s;ion from the main point before us, not to condemn or decry human litera|ture, but to &s;hew, that it ought to be u&s;ed only in &s;ubordination to divine; and that a Chri&s;tian, if the Holy Spirit guided the pen of the Apo&s;tle, when he wrote this epi&s;tle, ought to &s;tudy no books, but &s;uch as lead him to a farther knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified.</P>
<P>AND there is the more rea&s;on for this, becau&s;e of the great mi&s;chief the contrary practice has done to the church of GOD: for, what was it but this learning, or rather this ignorance, that kept &s;o many of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees from the &s;aving know|ledge of JESUS CHRIST? And what is it, but this human wi&s;dom, this &s;cience, fal&s;ely &s;o called, that blinds the under&s;tanding, and corrupts the hearts of &s;o many modern unbelievers, and makes them unwilling to &s;ubmit to the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of GOD by faith in CHRIST JESUS? But,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Without this knowledge, our per|formances, as well as per&s;ons, will not be accept|able in the &s;ight of GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="026477_0010_0FD055314AC8CDA0">
"THROUGH faith," &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, that is, through a lively faith in a Mediator to come, "Abel offered a more acceptable &s;acrifice than Cain." And it is through a like faith, or an ex|perimental knowledge of the &s;ame divine Media|tor, that our &s;acrifices of prayer, prai&s;e and thank&s;givings, come up as an ince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e before the throne of grace.</P>
<P>TWO per&s;ons may go up to the temple to pray; but he only will return home ju&s;tified, who, in the language of our collects, &s;incerely of|fers up his prayers through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.</P>
<P>FOR it is this great atonement, this all-&s;uffi|cient &s;acrifice, which alone can give us bold|ne&s;s to approach with our prayers to the Holy of Holies: and he that pre&s;umes to go without this, acts Korah's crime over again; offers unto GOD &s;trange fire, and, con&s;equently, will be re|jected by him.</P>
<P>FARTHER, as our devotions to GOD will not, &s;o neither, without this knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, will our acts of charity to men be ac|cepted by him. For did we give all our goods to feed the poor, and yet were de&s;titute of this knowledge, it would profit us nothing.</P>
<P>THIS our ble&s;&s;ed LORD him&s;elf intimates in the 25th of Matthew, where he tells tho&s;e who had been rich in good works, "That in|a&s;much as they did it unto one of the lea&s;t of his brethren, they did it unto him." From whence we may plainly infer, that it is &s;eeing CHRIST in his members, and doing good to them out of an experimental knowledge of his love to us, that alone will render our alms-deeds rewardable at the la&s;t day.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="026477_0011_0FD05532CAF81718">
LASTLY, As neither our acts of piety nor charity, &s;o neither will our civil nor moral actions be acceptable to GOD, without this ex|perimental knowledge of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>OUR modern pretenders to rea&s;on, indeed, &s;et up another principle to act from; they talk, I know not what, of doing moral and civil du|ties of life, from the moral fitne&s;s and unfit|ne&s;s of things. But &s;uch men are blind, how|ever they may pretend to &s;ee; and going thus about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, are utterly ignorant of the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of GOD by faith in CHRIST JESUS.</P>
<P>FOR though we grant that morality is a &s;ub|&s;tantial part of Chri&s;tianity, and that CHRIST came not to de&s;troy, or take off the moral law, as a rule of action, but to explain, and &s;o fulfil it; yet we af|firm, that our moral and civil actions are now no farther acceptable in the fight of GOD the Father, than as they proceed from the principle of a new nature, and an experimental knowledge of, or vi|tal faith in his dear Son.</P>
<P>THE death of JESUS CHRIST has turned our whole lives into one continued &s;acrifice; and whe|ther we eat or drink, whether we pray to GOD, or do any thing to man, it mu&s;t all be done out of a love for, and knowledge of him who died and ro&s;e again, to render all, even our mo&s;t ordinary deeds, acceptable in the fight of GOD.</P>
<P>IF we live by this principle, if CHRIST be the Al|pha and Omega of all our actions, then our lea&s;t are acceptable &s;acrifices; but if this principle be want|ing, our mo&s;t pompous &s;ervices avail nothing: we are but &s;piritual idolaters; we &s;acrifice to our own net; we make an idol of our&s;elves, by mak|ing our&s;elves, and not CHRIST, the end of our ac|tions;
<PB N="13" REF="026477_0012_0FD0553448F8D060">
and, therefore, &s;uch actions are &s;o far from being accepted by GOD, that, according to the language of one of the Articles of our Church, "We doubt not but they have the nature of &s;in, be|cau&s;e they &s;pring not from an experimental faith in, and knowledge of JESUS CHRIST."</P>
<P>WERE we not fallen creatures, we might then act, perhaps, from other principles; but &s;ince we are fallen from GOD in Adam, and are re&s;tored again only by the obedience and death of JESUS CHRIST, the face of things is entirely changed, and all we think, &s;peak or do, is only accepted in and through him.</P>
<P>JUSTLY, therefore, may I, in the</P>
<P>THIRD and la&s;t place, exhort you to put the Apo&s;tle's re&s;olution in practice, and be&s;eech you, with him, to determine, "Not to know any thing, &s;ave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified."</P>
<P>I SAY, <HI>determine;</HI> for unle&s;s you &s;it down fir&s;t, and count the co&s;t, and from a well-grounded conviction of the excellency of this, above all other knowledge what&s;oever, re&s;olve to make this your chief &s;tudy, your only end, your one thing needful, every frivolous temptation will draw you a&s;ide from the pur&s;uit after it.</P>
<P>YOUR friends and carnal acquaintance, and, above all, your grand adver&s;ary the devil, will be per&s;uading you to determine not to know any thing, but how to lay up goods for many years, and to get a knowledge and ta&s;te of the pomps and vanities of this wicked world; but do you determine not to follow, or be led by them; and the more they per&s;uade you to know other things, the more do you "determine not to know any thing, &s;ave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified." For, this knowledge never faileth; but whether
<PB N="14" REF="026477_0013_0FD05535CC37E630">
they be riches, they &s;hall fail; whether they be pomps, they &s;hall cea&s;e; whether they be vanities, they &s;hall fade away: but the knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified, abideth forever.</P>
<P>WHATEVER, therefore, you are ignorant of, be not ignorant of this. If you know CHRIST, and him crucified, you know enough to make you happy, &s;uppo&s;ing you know nothing el&s;e; and without this, all your other knowledge cannot keep you from being everla&s;tingly mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>VALUE not, then, the contempt of friends, which you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily meet with upon your open pro|fe&s;&s;ion to act according to this determination. For your Ma&s;ter, who&s;e you are, was de&s;pi&s;ed before you; and all that will know nothing el&s;e but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified, mu&s;t, in &s;ome degree or other, &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary that offences &s;hould come, to try what is in our hearts, and whether we will be faith|ful &s;oldiers of JESUS CHRIST, or not.</P>
<P>DARE ye then to confe&s;s our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter be|fore men, and to &s;hine as lights in the world, amid&s;t a crooked and perver&s;e generation? Let us not be content with following him afar off; for then we &s;hall, as Peter did, &s;oon deny him; but let us be altogether Chri&s;tians, and let our &s;peech, and all our actions, declare to the world who&s;e di&s;|ciples we are, that we have indeed "determined not to know any thing, &s;ave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified." Then, well will it be with us, and happy, un&s;peakably happy &s;hall we be, even here; and, what is infinitly better, when others that de|&s;pi&s;ed us, &s;hall be calling for the mountains to fall on them, and the hills to cover them, we &s;hall be exalted to &s;it down on the right-hand of GOD, and &s;hine as the &s;un in the firmament, in the kingdom of our mo&s;t adorable Redeemer, for ever and ever.</P>
<P>WHICH GOD of his infinite mercy grant, &amp;c.</P>
