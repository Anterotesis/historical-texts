<HEAD>PREFATORY DEDICATION. TO LORD HAWKE, BARON TOWTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN an aera when ambition&mdash;di&s;&s;ipa|tion&mdash;and hypocritic gentlene&s;s of manners are profe&s;&s;edly the pur|&s;uits of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed cha|racters;&mdash;when the external graces are more coveted, and more a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly cultivated, than the virtues of the heart:&mdash;In an aera, my Lord, when many authors, and &s;ome the
<PB N="ii" REF="024121_0003_0FC3BCE65A52BD30">
mo&s;t eminent, labour to promote the fir&s;t&mdash;increa&s;e the &s;econd&mdash;heighten the poli&s;h of the third&mdash;and pro&s;ti|tute their pens, as if determined to extingui&s;h the la&s;t, by every art of fal&s;e rea&s;oning, by every invention of imagination; it may appear &s;in|gular, that this little volume, direct|ly militating again&s;t the&s;e accom|pli&s;hments of the great world, and attempting to &s;upply their places by qualities built on the more &s;olid ba|&s;is of religion and morality, &s;hould a&s;k for patronage from one whom fate has ordained to move in that elevated &s;phere: but, my Lord, even in courts the mo&s;t notorious for pro|fligacy of manners, virtue has ever found &s;ome votaries.</P>
<P>The corruptions of vice become con&s;equential in proportion as they become fa&s;hionable; and folly a&s;|&s;umes the air of ornamental grace, and diffu&s;es it&s;elf almo&s;t univer&s;ally,
<PB N="iii" REF="024121_0004_0FC3BCE7CB579080">
only when cheri&s;hed and &s;upported by tho&s;e whom the little world look up to in the &s;uperior walks of life, and con&s;ider as an example of imi|tation.</P>
<P>From hence we find the advocates for error perpetually multiplying, and the clear fountain of true hap|pine&s;s exchanged for the turbid &s;tream of unprofitable plea&s;ure.&mdash; For it is certain, real felicity cannot be obtained but by a firm adherence to virtue, and a determined confor|mity to its dictates.&mdash;The glare of vice may, for a while, dazzle the &s;ight; but it cheers not the &s;oul, or makes glad the heart from the purity of its lu&s;tre: like an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> it leads us into perplexities&mdash; doubts&mdash; and misfortunes, and there leaves us to &s;truggle with the calamities it has enticed us to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>The intent, therefore, of the fol|lowing &s;heets, is, to give a reli&s;h for
<PB N="iv" REF="024121_0005_0FC3BCE96764AFB0">
the religious and moral duties; that the veil under which vice approaches the young and inexperienced may be thrown a&s;ide; and its allurements, too often fatally &s;ucce&s;sful, be ex|po&s;ed and evidently di&s;covered as the harpies of mi&s;chief, and the har|bingers of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The intent is, by gentle means to lead the negligent and incautious into the path of rectitude,&mdash;implant in their bo&s;oms the love of truth,&mdash; and from the richne&s;s of the manure and fertility of the &s;oil make the young plant &s;hoot up with vigour, and bring forth the plea&s;ant fruit of goodne&s;s in abundance and perfec|tion.</P>
<P>The intent is, I will not &s;ay to make every man the builder of his own fortune, but I will &s;ay more, the e&s;tabli&s;her of his own peace;&mdash;a ble&s;|&s;ing infinitely more valuable than fame&mdash;riches&mdash;or power. For, if he

inculcates the maxims herein con|tained, he will pa&s;s through the bu&s;|tle of the bu&s;y world, though &s;ur|rounded with the &s;nares of villainy, and machinations of treachery, in &s;afety and without reproach:&mdash;and, when he retires into the &s;eque&s;tered and &s;olitary &s;cene, he will provide for him&s;elf a rich repa&s;t, where re|flection will feed on the con&s;olatory comfort of &s;elf-approbation, and his hours pa&s;s away in the &s;weetne&s;s of content:&mdash;He will view the misfor|tunes of mankind with an eye of pity, and afford them relief:&mdash;He will be|hold the plea&s;ures of his neighbours with a &s;mile of &s;ympathy, and enjoy them as his own:&mdash;He will pay every tribute due to his Creator with grati|tude and joy, and will hold conver&s;e with the God of his wor&s;hip, from the incorruptibility of his heart, and the purity of his actions.</P>

<HEAD>SENTIMENTAL BEAUTIES AND MORAL DELINEATIONS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ACUTENESS IN REPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS has ever been allowed a happine&s;s peculiar to the female &s;ex, particularly on &s;ubjects wherein they are in &s;ome degree con|ver&s;ant; for their imaginations generally keep pace with the narration, that they anticipate its end, and are ready to deliver their &s;entiments on it as &s;oon as it is fini&s;hed, while &s;ome of the male hearers, who&s;e minds were buried in &s;ettling the propriety, comparing the circum|&s;tances, and examining the con&s;i&s;tencies of what was &s;aid, are obliged to pau&s;e and di&s;criminate before they think of an&s;wering.</P>
<P>Indeed, a man of reflection, if he does not keep an intimate commerce with the world, will be &s;ometimes &s;o entangled in the intricacies of inten&s;e thought, that he will have the appear|ance
<PB N="14" REF="024121_0015_0FC3BD09C9256A58">
of a confu&s;ed and perplexed expre&s;&s;ion, while a &s;prightly woman will extricate her&s;elf with that lively and <HI>ra&s;h dexterity</HI> which will al|mo&s;t always plea&s;e, though it is very far from being always right.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ier to confound than to convince an opponent; the former may be effected by a turn that has more happine&s;s than truth in it. But, a young lady's vanity &s;hould not be too much elated with this fal&s;e applau&s;e, which is given, not to her merit, but her &s;ex: &s;he has not per|haps gained a victory, though &s;he may be al|lowed a triumph; and it &s;hould humble her to reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her &s;trength, but her weakne&s;s. It is worth while to di&s;criminate between the applau&s;e, which is given from the complai&s;ance of others, and that which is paid to our own merit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AFFABILITY.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to render our&s;elves amiable in &s;oci|ety, we &s;hould correct every appearance of har&s;hne&s;s in our behaviour. That courte&s;y &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h our demeanor, which &s;prings, not &s;o much from &s;tudied politene&s;s, as from a mild and gentle heart. We &s;hould follow the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the world in matters indifferent; but &s;top when they become &s;inful. Our manners
<PB N="15" REF="024121_0016_0FC3BD0B1071BB68">
ought to be &s;imple and natural, and of cour&s;e they will be engaging. Affectation is certain deformity&mdash;By forming them&s;elves on fanta&s;tic models, and vying with one another in every reigning folly, the young begin with being ri|diculous, and end in being vicious and immo|ral.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ANXIETY, THE VICE OF AGE.</HEAD>
<P>IGNORANCE of what is good or evil &s;hould correct Anxiety about worldly &s;ucce&s;s. As ra&s;hne&s;s is the vice of youth, the oppo&s;ite extreme of immoderate care is the vice of ad|vancing years; but, &s;ince attention is &s;o often fru&s;trated, it &s;hould never be allowed to deprive us of tranquillity; that degree of uncertainty, therefore, ought to render us temperate in pur|&s;uit, calm the perturbation of hope and fear, and cure the pain of anxiety.</P>
<P>Anxiety is the poi&s;on of human life. It is the parent of many &s;ins, and of more mi&s;eries. In a world where every thing is &s;o doubtful&mdash; where we may &s;ucceed in our wi&s;h, and be mi|&s;erable&mdash;where we may be di&s;appointed, and be ble&s;s'd in the di&s;appointment; what means a re&s;tle&s;s &s;tir and commotion of the mind? Soli|citude cannot alter the cour&s;e, or unravel the intricacy of human events&mdash;Curio&s;ity cannot
<PB N="16" REF="024121_0017_0FC3BD0C8B3D3668">
pierce through the cloud which the Supreme Being hath made impenetrable to the human eye&mdash;Wi&s;dom commands man to retire after he has done all that was incumbent on him, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s his mind in peace. By going beyond this point, by giving him&s;elf up to immoderate concern about unknown events, he can do no|thing to advance this &s;ucce&s;s, and does much to ruin his peace;&mdash;he plants within his brea&s;t the thorn which is long to gall him&mdash;To the vanity of life he adds vexation of &s;pirit, which is whol|ly of his own creation, not of divine appoint|ment.</P>
<P>For the dubious goods of this world were never de&s;igned by God to rai&s;e &s;uch eager at|tachment. They were given to man for his oc|ca&s;ional refre&s;hment, not for his chief felicity: by &s;etting an exce&s;&s;ive value upon objects which were intended only for his &s;econdary regard, he changes their nature. Seeking more &s;atisfaction from them than they are able to afford, he re|ceives le&s;s than they might give; from a mi&s;|taken care to &s;ecure his happine&s;s, he brings upon him&s;elf certain mi&s;ery.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>INDISCRIMINATE APPLAUSE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the fault of many that they do not always carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between running into the error of detraction, and its oppo&s;ite extreme of
<PB N="17" REF="024121_0018_0FC3BD0E5D5D78A8">
unde&s;erved prai&s;e&mdash;This proceeds from the fal&s;e idea they entertain, that the direct contrary to what is wrong, mu&s;t be right. Thus the dread of only being &s;u&s;pected of one fault, makes them actually guilty of another.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of avoiding the imputation of en|vy, impels them to be in&s;incere; and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a reputation for &s;weetne&s;s of temper and genero&s;ity, they affect to &s;peak &s;ometimes of very indifferent characters with the mo&s;t extra|vagant applau&s;e. But this habit of exaggera|tion greatly weakens their credit, and de&s;troys the weight of their opinion on other occa&s;ions; for people very &s;oon di&s;cover what degree of faith is to be given both to their judgment and their veracity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>METHOD IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>IN delivering our &s;entiments on particular &s;ub|jects, there is nothing which is attended with better effect, and makes us appear to more ad|vantage than offering our opinions with clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion; and this can only be done by ar|ranging them in proper order, &s;o that they may appear regularly to ari&s;e one from the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her: this is &s;tiled method, and prevents conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n; hinders us from indulging in the luxuriance of
<PB N="18" REF="024121_0019_0FC3BD0F85129580">

<HEAD>AVARICE.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the vices of old age, which appears the mo&s;t unaccountable, is that covetous attachment to worldly intere&s;t with which it is

<P>In proportion as the vigour both of body and mind declines, timidity may be expected to increa&s;e. With anxious and fearful eye, the aged look forward to the evils which threaten them, and to the changes which may befal.

<P>But, though this cautious frugality may be ju&s;tified, &s;ordid avarice can by no means be excu&s;ed. They &s;hould be charitable and do good. They &s;hould mix beneficence to their friends, with a cheerful enjoyment of the com|forts which befit their &s;tate. They will then receive the returns of real re&s;pect and love. Otherways, by their riches, they procure no more than pretended demon&s;trations of regard; while their ill judged par&s;imony occa&s;ions many &s;ecret wi&s;hes for their death.</P>
<P>Chilled by the hand of time the heart lo&s;es that tender &s;en&s;ibility, with which it once en|tered into the concerns and &s;orrows of others.

<HEAD>BEHAVIOUR.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the chief beauties in a female cha|racter is that mode&s;t re&s;erve, that re|tiring delicacy which avoids the public eye, and is di&s;concerted even at the gaze of admiration. For when a girl cea&s;es to blu&s;h, &s;he has lo&s;t the mo&s;t powerful charm of beauty. That extreme &s;en&s;ibility, which it indicates, is peculiarly en|gaging.</P>
<P>Silence in company, particularly a large one, is never mi&s;taken by the judicious and di&s;cerning for dulne&s;s, but be&s;peaks a mode&s;ty e&s;&s;ential in the female &s;ex. Dignity of behaviour is nece&s;|&s;ary at public places, but care mu&s;t be taken not to mi&s;take that for that confident ea&s;e, that unaba&s;hed countenance which &s;eems to &s;et the company at defiance.</P>
<P>Women &s;hould be cautious even in di&s;playing their good &s;en&s;e. It is often thought a&s;&s;uming a &s;uperiority over the re&s;t of the company; but their learning &s;hould be kept a profound &s;ecret, e&s;pecially from men, who generally look with a jealous and malign eye on a woman of great parts, and a cultivated under&s;tanding.</P>

It is a laudable pride, as well as &s;ecret plea&s;ure, which ought to be indulged, in being the friend and refuge of the unhappy, but without the vanity of &s;hewing it.</P>
<P>Every &s;pecies of indelicacy in conver&s;ation &s;hould be con&s;idered as &s;hameful and highly di&s;|gu&s;ting. A &s;acred regard &s;hould ever be had to truth, for lying is a mean and de&s;picable vice; though a lively embelli&s;hment of a humorous &s;tory, which is only intended to promote inno|cent mirth, cannot be under&s;tood to fall under that head.</P>

For the power of a fine woman over the hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of men, of men of the fine&s;t parts, is even beyond what &s;he conceives. They are &s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ing illu&s;ion, but they cannot, nor do they wi&s;h, to di&s;&s;olve it. But if &s;he is determined to di&s;pel the charm, it certainly is in her power, &s;he may &s;oon reduce <HI>the angel to a very ordinary girl.</HI></P>
<P>There is a native dignity in ingenuous mo|de&s;ty to be expected in the gentler &s;ex, which is their natural protection from the familiarity of men. The &s;entiment that a woman may al|low all innocent freedoms, provided her virtue is &s;ecure, is both gro&s;ly indelicate and dange|rous, and has proved fatal to many who have confided too much in this fallacious doctrine.</P>

<P>THERE is no character more truly di&s;gu&s;t|ing than that of a coquette; it originates from folly, is &s;upported by vanity, and termin|ates in contempt. It is the certain mark of a narrow mind, the illiberal &s;lave of ful&s;ome adul|ation, and has all its enjoyments increa&s;ed by &s;elf-adoration.</P>
<P>Yet there is a ca&s;e where a woman may co|quet ju&s;tifiably to the utmo&s;t verge which her con&s;cience will allow. It is where a gentleman purpo&s;es and declines to make his addre&s;&s;es, till &s;uch time as he thinks him&s;elf perfectly &s;ure of her con&s;ent. This at bottom is intended to force a woman to give up the undoubted privilege of her &s;ex, the privilege of refu&s;ing; it is intend|ed
<PB N="35" REF="024121_0036_0FC3BD3FCE036ED0">
to force her to explain her&s;elf, in effect before the gentleman deigns to do it, and, by this means, to oblige her to violate the mode&s;ty and delicacy of her &s;ex, and to invert the cleare&s;t or|der of nature.</P>
<P>All this &s;acrifice is propo&s;ed to be made mere|ly to gratify a mo&s;t de&s;picable vanity in a man, who would degrade the very woman, whom he wi&s;hes to make his wife.</P>
<P>But it &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed whether from this motive he delays to &s;peak explicitly, or from a diffidence in&s;eparable from true attach|ment. In the one ca&s;e he can &s;carce be u&s;ed too ill; in the other, he ought to be treated with the greate&s;t kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Women endeavour to ju&s;tify them&s;elves to the world, and to their own con&s;ciences, by a vari|ety of excu&s;es, when they act otherwi&s;e. Some|times they plead ignorance, or at lea&s;t uncer|tainty of the gentleman's real &s;entiments. Some|times they plead the decorum of the &s;ex, which enjoins an equal behaviour to all men, and for|bids them to con&s;ider any man as a lover, till he has directly told them &s;o. But they are not en|titled to plead the obligation of their virtue in oppo&s;ition to the &s;uperior ones of gratitude, ju&s;|tice and humanity.</P>
<P>The man is entitled to all the&s;e, who prefers one woman to the re&s;t of her &s;ex, and perhaps who&s;e greate&s;t weakne&s;s is this very preference.
<PB N="36" REF="024121_0037_0FC3BD41256BF8A8">
The truth of the matter is, vanity and the love of admiration is &s;o prevailing a pa&s;&s;ion among&s;t the &s;ex, that they can be fond of the love, when they are indifferent to, or, even, when they de&s;pi&s;e the lover.</P>
<P>But the deepe&s;t, and mo&s;t artful coquetry is employed by women of &s;uperior ta&s;te and &s;en&s;e, to engage and fix the heart of a man whom the world, and whom they them&s;elves e&s;teem, al|though they are determined never to marry him. His conver&s;ation amu&s;es them, and his attach|ment is the highe&s;t gratification to their vanity; nay, they can &s;ometimes be gratified with the utter ruin of his fortune, fame and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>How odious mu&s;t characters of this kind ap|pear, e&s;pecially when contra&s;ted with tho&s;e who have principles, have genero&s;ity and dignity of &s;oul, that elevates them above the worthle&s;s va|nity recited!</P>
<P>Such a woman may always convert a lover, if &s;he cannot give him her affections, into a warm and &s;teady friend, provided he is a man of &s;en&s;e, re&s;olution and candour. If &s;he explains her&s;elf to him with a generous openne&s;s and free|dom, he mu&s;t feel the &s;troke as a man; but he will likewi&s;e bear it as a man: what he &s;uffers he will &s;uffer in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Every &s;entiment of e&s;teem will remain; but love, though it requires very little food, and is ea&s;ily &s;ur&s;eited with too much, yet it requires
<PB N="37" REF="024121_0038_0FC3BD42BB88E7E0">
&s;ome. He will view her in the light of a mar|ried woman; and though pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ides, yet a man of a candid and generous heart always re|tains a tenderne&s;s for a woman he has once loved, and who has u&s;ed him well, beyond what he feels for any other of her &s;ex.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>COURTSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>IF the attachment of a lover is agreeable to the object of his wi&s;hes, a woman &s;hould permit nature, good-&s;en&s;e and delicacy to direct her. If &s;he loves him &s;he &s;hould not di&s;cover to him the full extent of her love; no, not although &s;he marries him. That &s;ufficiently &s;hews her preference, which is all he is entitled to know. If he has delicacy he will a&s;k for no &s;tronger proof of her affection, for her &s;ake: if he has &s;en&s;e, he will not a&s;k it for his own.</P>
<P>Violent love cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, at lea&s;t cannot be expre&s;&s;ed, for any time together on both &s;ides; otherwi&s;e the certain con&s;equence, however con|cealed, is &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t: nature in this ca&s;e has laid the re&s;erve on woman.</P>
<P>If &s;he &s;ees evident proofs of a gentleman's attachment, and is determined to &s;hut her heart again&s;t him, &s;he &s;hould treat him honourably and humanely. She &s;hould not let him linger in a mi&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble &s;u&s;pen&s;e, but be anxious to let him
<PB N="38" REF="024121_0039_0FC3BD441E64D2A0">
know her &s;entiments with regard to him; and this may be done by a variety of ways,&mdash;from a certain &s;pecies of ea&s;y familiarity in behaviour he may be &s;atisfied, if he has any di&s;cernment, he has nothing to hope for,&mdash;from &s;olicitou&s;ly avoiding his company,&mdash;from the interpo&s;ition of a common friend to explain matters to him. But, if the&s;e methods are ineligible, opportu|nities of letting him explain him&s;elf, &s;hould not be avoided; it is acting barbarou&s;ly and un|ju&s;tly. If he forces an explanation, the an&s;wer &s;hould be polite, re&s;olute, and deci&s;ive.</P>

<HEAD>MAN'S DANGER AND SECURITY IN YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>IN that period of life too often characterized by forward pre&s;umption and headlong pur|&s;uit, &s;elf-conceit is the great &s;ource of tho&s;e dan|gers to which men are expo&s;ed; and it is pecu|liarly unfortunate, that the age which &s;tands mo&s;t in need of the coun&s;el of the wi&s;e, &s;hould be the mo&s;t prone to contemn it.

<HEAD>DEVOTION,</HEAD>
<P>IS the lively exerci&s;e of tho&s;e affections, which we owe to the &s;upreme Being. It compre|hends &s;everal emotions of the heart which ter|minate in the &s;ame object. The chief of them are veneration, gratitude, de&s;ire, and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>It implies fir&s;t, profound veneration for God, that is, affection compounded of awe and love; &mdash;&s;econdly, &s;incere gratitude for all his bene|fits: this is a warmer emotion than veneration; veneration looks up to the Deity as he is him|&s;elf; gratitude regards what he is towards us; &mdash;thirdly, the de&s;ire of the &s;oul after the favour of the &s;upreme Being, as its chief good and final re&s;t;&mdash;and fourthly, it advances to an en|tire re&s;ignation of the &s;oul to God.

<HEAD>ANGER AND ENVY CONTRASTED.</HEAD>
<P>ANGER is le&s;s rea&s;onable and more &s;incere than envy.

<P>Simple anger &s;oon runs it&s;elf out of breath, and is exhau&s;ted at the end of its tale, but it is for that cho&s;en period that envy has trea&s;ured up the mo&s;t barbed arrow in its whole quiver: anger puts a man out of him&s;elf; but the truly malicious generally pre&s;erve the appearance of &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or they could not &s;o effectually

<P>An angry man's enmity (if he be generous) will &s;ub&s;ide when the object of his re&s;entment becomes unfortunate; but the envious man can extract food for his malice out of calamity it&s;elf, if he finds his adver&s;ary bears it with dig|nity, or is pitied or a&s;&s;i&s;ted in it.

<P>THERE is a refined jargon, which has infe&s;t|ed letters, and tainted morals, unknown to our plain ance&s;tors, called <HI>&s;entiment, which is the varni&s;h of virtue to conceal the deformity of vice:</HI> and it is not uncommon for the &s;ame per&s;ons to make a je&s;t of religion, to break through the mo&s;t &s;olemn ties and engagements, to practi&s;e every art of latent fraud and open &s;eduction, and yet to value them&s;elves on &s;peaking and writing &s;entimentally.</P>
<P>Error is never likely to do &s;o much mi&s;chief as when it di&s;gui&s;es its real tendency, and puts on an engaging and attractive appearance. Many a young woman who would be &s;hocked
<PB N="63" REF="024121_0064_0FC3BD89461A31E0">
at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely flattered at the idea of a &s;entimental connection, though perhaps with a dangerous and de&s;igning man. Such an engagement will be infinitely dearer to her vanity, than an avowed and au|thori&s;ed attachment.</P>
<P>In order to maintain the &s;entimental cha|racter with dignity and propriety, a woman en|tertains the mo&s;t elevated ideas of di&s;propor|tionate alliances, and di&s;intere&s;ted love; and con&s;iders fortune, rank, and reputation as mere chimerical di&s;tinctions and vulgar prejudices.

<P>A &s;entimental girl very rarely entertains any doubt of her per&s;onal beauty; for &s;he has been daily accu&s;tomed to contemplate it her&s;elf, and to hear it from others. She will not, therefore, be very &s;olicitous for the confirmation of a truth &s;o &s;elf-evident; but &s;he &s;u&s;pects her preten&s;ions to under&s;tanding are more likely to be di&s;puted; and, for that rea&s;on, greedily devours every compliment offered to tho&s;e perfections which are le&s;s obvious, and more refined. She is per|&s;uaded that men need only open their eyes to decide on her beauty; while it will be the mo&s;t convincing proof of the ta&s;te, &s;en&s;e, and ele|gance
<PB N="64" REF="024121_0065_0FC3BD8B123ACB38">
of her admirer, that he can di&s;cern, and flatter tho&s;e qualities in her.</P>
<P>This latent but leading foible forms a clue to the heart; directed by this the lover affects to overlook that beauty which attracts common eyes; while he be&s;tows the mo&s;t delicate prai&s;es on the beauties of the mind; and fini&s;hes the climax of adulation by hinting &s;he is &s;uperior to it.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ublime attachments, if they end not in &s;eduction, &s;eldom conclude delightfully, even though they &s;hould terminate in the vulgar cata|&s;trophe of marriage. The vi&s;ionary heaven &s;oon fleets away, and the deluded godde&s;s is &s;hocked to find her&s;elf &s;tripped of all her cele&s;tial attributes.

<P>THOUSANDS of women of the be&s;t hearts and fine&s;t parts have been ruined by men who approach them under the &s;pecious name of friend&s;hip.

<HEAD>MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing which renders a woman more de&s;picable than her thinking it e&s;&s;en|tial to happine&s;s to be married. Be&s;ides the gro&s;s indelicacy of the &s;entiment, it is a fal&s;e one, as thou&s;ands of women have experienced. But a married &s;tate, if entered into from pro|per

Care &s;hould be taken not to relin|qui&s;h the ea&s;e and independence of a &s;ingle life, to become the &s;laves of a fool, or a tyrant's caprice.</P>
<P>Love is very &s;eldom produced at fir&s;t &s;ight; at lea&s;t, in that ca&s;e, it mu&s;t have a very un|ju&s;tifiable foundation. True love is founded on e&s;teem, in a corre&s;pondence of ta&s;tes and &s;enti|ments, and &s;teals on the heart imperceptibly. Therefore, before the affections come to be in the lea&s;t engaged to any man, women &s;hould examine their tempers, their ta&s;tes, and their hearts <HI>very &s;everely;</HI> and &s;ettle in their own minds, what are the requi&s;ites to their happine&s;s in a married &s;tate; and, as it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould get every thing they wi&s;h, they &s;hould come to a &s;teady determination what they are to con&s;ider as e&s;&s;ential, and what may be &s;acrificed.</P>

<P>Should they have the misfortune to have &s;uch tempers, and &s;uch &s;entiments deeply rooted in

them; &s;hould they have &s;pirit and re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t the &s;olicitations of vanity, the per&s;ecution of friends; and can they &s;upport the pro&s;pect of the many inconveniences attending the &s;tate of an old maid, then they may indulge them&s;elves in that kind of &s;entimental reading and con|ver&s;ation, which is mo&s;t corre&s;pondent to their feelings.</P>

<P>If this refinement once takes deep root in their minds, and they do not mean to obey its dictates, but marry from vulgar and mercenary views, they may never be able to eradicate it entirely, and then it will embitter all their married days.

determined by their own ta&s;tes. If they have enough between them, as will &s;atisfy all de|mands, it is &s;ufficient.</P>
