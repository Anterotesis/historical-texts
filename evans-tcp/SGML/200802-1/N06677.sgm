<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING lately &s;een in the Journals of the A&s;&s;embly of this Colony, held in 1758, a long Memorial, addre&s;&s;ed to the Right Honorable the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for Trade and Plan|tations, by the Merchants of London, in Be|half of them&s;elves and of their Corre&s;pondents, Merchants of <HI>Bri&s;tol, Liverpool</HI> and <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> trading and intere&s;ted in the Colony of <HI>Virginia,</HI> I cannot help entertaining you with &s;ome Ob&s;ervations upon it; and, that you may judge of the Ju&s;tice with which they are made, I have tra&s;cribed the whole Memorial, as it appears on the Journals afore&s;aid.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>MEMORIAL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>That the General-A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Virginia</HI> have lately pa&s;&s;ed an Act, whereby their Provincial Trea&s;urer is autho|thorized, for the Purpo&s;es therein mentioned, to i&s;&s;ue Paper Notes to the Amount of &pound;. 80,000 which &s;aid Paper Notes &s;o i&s;&s;ued and rated at Proclamation Money by the &s;aid Act of A&s;&s;embly, are thereby declared to be a lawful Tender in Payment of any Debt or Demand whatever, excepting his Maje&s;ty's Quitrents.</P>
<P>That your Petitioners having very large Sums of Money now due to them in the &s;aid Province, in the Way of Trade,
<PB N="4" REF="008476_0003_102f5a0de8b43250">
upon Bargains and Contracts made with the Inhabitants of <HI>Virginia</HI>; and for, and on their Account, do moreover &s;tand bound to the Trade&s;men in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> for large Sums: All which &s;aid Bargains and Contracts, by general Agree|ment, are payable in Sterling, or at the Rate of Sterling, lawful Money of this Kingdom; and were entered into, and concluded, long before the I&s;&s;uing of &s;uch Notes, and before any &s;uch Traffick, by Way of Paper-Money, was known or heard of in the <HI>Virginia</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>Your Memoriali&s;ts therefore beg Leave hereupon to re|mon&s;trate to your Lord&s;hips the very great Injury that may ari&s;e to the trading Intere&s;t of the&s;e Kingdoms, and more particularly to your Memoriali&s;ts, from the <HI>Virginia</HI> Act, as it now &s;tands; not only by Rea&s;on that it does affect Debts, Bargains and Contracts, due to the Merchants of the&s;e King|doms, expre&s;ly &s;tipulated payable to them, before the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act, in Sterling, or at the Rate of Sterling, lawful Money of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but does moreover invert the Na|ture of Trade, from a certain to an uncertain Value of Pro|fit and Lo&s;s: And, in &s;o far, your Memoriali&s;ts do conceive the &s;aid Act to be arbitrary and unju&s;t; arbitrary, becau&s;e it does, <HI>ex po&s;t facto,</HI> extend to Debts due on Bargains and Contracts made before the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act; unju&s;t, by Rea&s;on that it does depreciate the Nature of &s;uch Debts, by making Debts (payable in Sterling Money, of univer&s;al Va|lue) to be received in Paper Notes of a local, uncertain, and fluctuating Value, at the &s;ame Time that no Provi&s;ion is made by the Act for making Payment in &s;uch Notes <HI>ad va|lorem</HI> of Sterling, according to the Difference of Exchange between &s;uch Paper-Money and Sterling, when Payment is made; which Provi&s;ion, on Principles of Law and com|mon Equity, ought to have been made: In &s;o far, there|fore, as that your Memoriali&s;ts may be very great Sufferers from the Defects in the &s;aid Act as it now &s;tands, as well as from a Clau&s;e in one other Act that pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;aid Pro|vince <HI>Anno</HI> 1748, intituled, <HI>An Act delaring the Law con|cerning Executions, and for the Relief of in&s;olvent Debtors, whereby Executions for Sterling Debts &s;hall be levied in current Money, at the Rate of</HI> 25 per Cent. <HI>Advance on Sterling for the Difference of Exchange, and not otherwi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="008476_0004_102f59ea03d4d5c0">Your Memoriali&s;ts do therefore humbly offer to your Lord&s;hips Con&s;ideration an Expedient which your Memo|riali&s;ts apprehend may fully an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed by your Memoriali&s;ts by guarding again&s;t the Injury that may ari&s;e from the &s;aid Acts, with re&s;pect to your Memoriali&s;ts Properties and the Trade of this Kingdom, and at the &s;ame Time no ways defeat the Operation of the Paper Money Act, with regard to the military Services thereby intended; which Expedient is <HI>viz.</HI> That the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> be in&s;tructed by his Maje&s;ty to urge to the A&s;&s;embly the pa&s;&s;ing another Act for explaining and amending the Act now in Que&s;tion, and thereby provide that all Debts, Bar|gains, or Contracts, that were entered into before the pa&s;&s;ing of the &s;aid Act &s;hall remain and &s;tand payable according to the Nature of &s;uch Debts, Bargains or Contracts. And that all Bargains or Contracts that have been heretofore made, or that may hereafter be made and entered into, in the Cour&s;e of Trade or otherwi&s;e, between the&s;e Kingdoms and <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> if the &s;ame &s;hall be expre&s;ly &s;tipulated and made pay|able according to Sterling or lawful Money of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; that then and in &s;uch Ca&s;es &s;uch Paper Notes &s;o i&s;&s;ued or that hereafter may be i&s;&s;ued, or any other Species of Current Money not being Sterling, &s;hall not be deemed a lawful Ten|der in Payment of any &s;uch Debt, Bargain, or Contract, &s;o entered into, payable in Sterling or lawful Money of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> unle&s;s the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons to whom &s;uch Payment is tendered in Paper Notes or in any other Species of Current Money &s;hall think proper to accept thereof in &s;uch Paper Notes or other Species of Current Money, if the &s;ame &s;hall be offered to him or them, according to the Difference of Exchange between &s;uch Paper Notes and other Species of Current Money, at the Time when &s;uch Paper Notes or other Species of Current Money &s;hall be &s;o offered in Pay|ment of Sterling Debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons &s;o accepting of Payment in Paper Notes or in any other Species of Current Money, according to the Difference of Exchange between Sterling and Paper Curency, and &s;uch other Species of Current Money, &s;hall be deemed and held as fully paid and &s;atisfy'd for his and their Debts to all Intents and Purpo&s;es as if &s;uch Payment had been made in Sterling

or lawful Money of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> any thing in the afore|&s;aid Act or in any other Act to the contrary notwith&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>To an Amendment of this Nature your Memoriali&s;ts conceive the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Virginia</HI> can make no Objection, in &s;o far as that it is <HI>bon&acirc; fide</HI> founded on Principles of common Ju&s;tice and the Laws of this Kingdom, and more particu|larly agreeable to the Act of the Sixth Year of her late Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> whereby foreign Silver is made Cur|rent in the Plantations, but in due Proportion as the intrin|&s;ick Value thereof is to Sterling. And at the &s;ame Time it is thereby provided that all &s;uch Species of Silver Coin &s;o made Current &s;hall not affect Contracts or Bargains made prior to the Act. And it is thereby further provided that nothing in the &s;aid Act &s;hall be con&s;trued to compel any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons what&s;oever to receive in Payment any of the &s;aid Species of &s;uch foreign Silver Coin as the &s;ame is rated in the Act. In &s;o far therefore as that the Amend|ment propo&s;ed by your Memoriali&s;ts to the Act of <HI>Virginia,</HI> coincides with Equity and the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and with the Regard that is at all Times due to the trading Intere&s;t of the&s;e Kingdoms, and with the Ju&s;tice due to your Memo|riali&s;ts in this particular Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>From &s;uch Con&s;iderations your Memoriali&s;ts hum|bly hope for your Lord&s;hips Interpo&s;ition with his Maje&s;ty for an In&s;truction to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> for the Purpo&s;es afore&s;aid, and that your Lord&s;hips will be plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;pend giving Judgment upon the <HI>Virginia</HI> Act as it now &s;tands by way of Approbation thereof, 'til &s;uch Time as the Sen&s;e of the A&s;&s;embly of that Province is had upon the Amendments propo&s;ed thereto.</P>

<P>AS to the Memorial, by Way of general Ob&s;ervation, I &s;ay, it appears from the Complexion of it, to be a Performance wholely dictated by an uncommon Kind of Partiality, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Species of Weakne&s;s imaginable: For from the word|ing of it, it is evident, that it is but of very late Date that any Paper Money was heard of in <HI>Virginia.</HI> It would there|fore have been but Ju&s;tice, previou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to any Complaint in an In&s;tance &s;o rare, and new, to have made &s;ome Enquiry
<PB N="7" REF="008476_0006_102f59ebc9803c58">
into the Cau&s;e of making &s;uch an Act; e&s;pecially if it is attended with &s;uch dreadful Con&s;equences as it is repre&s;ented to be. They would then have found that not only extreme <HI>Poverty,</HI> but even extreme <HI>Danger,</HI> united to compel the Colony to fall on &s;ome Expedient for rai&s;ing Money to defray the Expences of an Army that they were under the greate&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity imaginable of collecting together, to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the rapid Incur&s;ions of a cruel and barba|rous <HI>Enemy.</HI> And that before they attempted to &s;ub&s;titute Paper or any Thing in Lieu of what I find is by Merchants only called, Money, they had u&s;ed every Method of borrow|ing Money at a greater Intere&s;t than common, and if I am not much mi&s;taken, Application was even made to &s;ome of the&s;e complaining Gentlemen, but with very little Succe&s;s. Such an Enquiry would not only have explained the Cau&s;e of making &s;uch an Act, by &s;hewing the Dilemma that the Country was in (for altho' many Gentlemen di&s;covered on the Occa&s;ion a truly Patriot Spirit, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible for private Fortunes to go any &s;erviceable Length in &s;uch an Affair) but it might po&s;&s;ibly have convinced Men, calling &s;o loudly for <HI>Equity, Law, Ju&s;tice,</HI> and what not, that &s;uch an Act was exceedingly proper, and indeed well prece|dented; for we find even limited Monarchies and Common|wealths have done the &s;ame Thing in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Cir|cum&s;tances: Some have coined in the Field, and others have &s;ub&s;tituted ba&s;er Metals in the Room of Gold and Sil|ver which they had not, to an&s;wer their pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ions. Surely then they who &s;hall apply the Words <HI>Arbitrary</HI> and <HI>Unju&s;t</HI> to a Tran&s;action truely &s;imilar as to its Circum&s;tances, to what has before been deemed nece&s;&s;ary and pa&s;&s;ed uncen|&s;ured, mu&s;t either be very bad Haberda&s;hers of Epithets, or Men of low and &s;elfi&s;h Notions. Should it be &s;aid that <HI>Virginia</HI> ought not to be con&s;idered with re&s;pect to its Power of making Laws in the Light of a limited Monarchy or Commonwealth; I an&s;wer that whenever any People are reduced to the before mentioned Nece&s;&s;ity, it is an incon|te&s;table Argument for the Exertion of every Degree of Power, &s;ince it is certainly ultimately exerci&s;ed for the ab&s;olute Benefit of that very State from which a Power of the &s;ame Nature mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been granted, had
<PB N="8" REF="008476_0007_102f5a1469cdb0d0">
it been near enough to have extended it in a proper Time: Such a Power therefore is always imply'd in the very Nature of Things, let the Degree of Subjection be what it will; and the Con&s;equence of its not being &s;o, would in the Ca&s;e of any potent and &s;udden Inva&s;ion be the Lo&s;s of the Colony to that very State which claims the Subjection, unle&s;s Matters &s;hall be conducted hereafter with much greater Precaution, than has hitherto been experienced. To pre|vent any Thing that may be advanced again&s;t this Argument with Re&s;pect to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Situation of the Colony, on Account of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;ent to it under General <HI>Braddock,</HI> or the &pound;. 20000 remitted to the Honorable <HI>Robert Dinwid|die,</HI> the then Governor; I &s;ay in the former In&s;tance, it was more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the Defeat &s;uffered, than it was before the A&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;ent; for the unexpected Victory in|&s;pired the Enemy, with greater Boldne&s;s, and if po&s;&s;ible le&s;&s;ened their Humanity. In the In&s;tance of the Money, the Per&s;on intru&s;ted is perhaps able to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome Rea&s;on why not more than &pound;. 800 was expended, or apply'd to the U&s;e of the Colony, or Maintenance of their Army.</P>
<P>AND here I think I ought to be a little explicit, and di&s;clo&s;e a Matter &s;omewhat &s;candalous in the tran&s;acting. Mr. <HI>Dinwiddie,</HI> from a general Fore&s;ight in turning the Penny (always di&s;tingui&s;hable in him) having ordered certain Nece&s;&s;aries for the U&s;e of the Forces, under the Command of General <HI>Braddock,</HI> refu&s;ed ab&s;olutely to di&s;charge the Accounts of the Per&s;ons employ'd to procure the &s;ame to the Amount of &pound;. 1236-11-2, pretending that he could not regularly carry tho&s;e Articles to Account with the Government in <HI>England,</HI> and by frequent Solicitations to the Committee appointed for the Di&s;po&s;al of the Money rai&s;ed here for the Defence of the Colony, he engaged them to pay that Sum under a mo&s;t &s;olemn Promi&s;e of &s;ubjecting to their Order &pound;. 5000 that remained in his Hands out of the above mentioned &pound;. 20000, which he alledged might be regularly done, as that Money was remitted to him for the U&s;e of the Colony; but when the A&s;&s;embly addre&s;&s;ed him to di&s;po&s;e of a Part of that &pound;. 5000 for building a Fort in the <HI>Cherokee</HI> Country; a Thing recommended to them as nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="9" REF="008476_0008_102f59ed4fafb770">
pre&s;erve the Friend&s;hip of tho&s;e People, he returned for An&s;wer, that he had no more remaining in his Hands of the above &pound;. 20000 than the &pound;. 800 before mentioned; accord|ingly no more than that Sum was apply'd as is before ex|pre&s;&s;ed. So that the Country in&s;tead of being benefitted by that Remittance from <HI>England,</HI> was not a little injured in as much as it was properly &s;peaking the Means of their loo&s;ing &pound;. 435-11-2 of their own Money in this in&s;tance alone. I might add further, that at the Time the above Sum of &pound;. 20000 was in that Gentleman's Hands, or at his Di&s;|po&s;al, he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to lend the Country the Sum of &pound;. 3000 at the exorbitant Intere&s;t of Six per Cent. which was punctually paid him. The&s;e Facts are too true to be deny'd, and although the Sum perhaps may be too trifling for the Enquiry of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, yet certain|ly as it was a very glaring Abu&s;e of the good Intentions of the People of <HI>England,</HI> it &s;eems but ju&s;t that the Public &s;hould be &s;atisfy'd with an impartial Examination into the Conduct of that Gentleman, in this Particular at lea&s;t, &s;ince from his own Mouth, we have been informed that the M&mdash;y at Home had complimented him with &pound;. 2000 of that Money as a Recompence for his extraordinary Care in the Di&s;po&s;al of it.</P>
<P>NOW as this was the Situation of the Country, could any Thing but mere <HI>Partiality</HI> and <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> dictate a Com|plaint again&s;t an Act &s;o immediately conducive to its Pre|&s;ervation. Thus far I ob&s;erve of the Memorial in general, I &s;hall now treat it in a more particular Manner, and pur&s;ue it as paragraphically as may be in order to &s;hew that the <HI>Partiality</HI> with which I charge it, is of &s;uch a Nature as will not endure a Di&s;gui&s;e even with the fal&s;e Shew of Rea|&s;oning which &s;eems to have been purpo&s;ely adapted quite thro' it.</P>
<P N="1">I. WE are told that the Paper Notes emitted by the Act are by it declared to be a lawful Tender in Payment of any Debt or Demand whatever (excepting his Maje&s;ty's Quitrents.) I agree it is &s;o declared in the Act, and of what U&s;e would &s;uch Notes have been, or to what Purpo&s;e &s;hould they have
<PB N="10" REF="008476_0009_102f5a176f47a340">
been i&s;&s;ued at all, if they were not to be Current in all Ca&s;es. Gentlemen may attempt to glo&s;s over their Endea|vours by talking of Expedients for making the Act &s;ervicea|ble for the <HI>military Purpo&s;es</HI> for which it was intended, and yet not general as to the Currency of the&s;e Notes; but I beg Leave to &s;ay it is nothing more than a Piece of artful Non&s;en&s;e; for what are the military Services of Money, but the paying of the Soldiers, and purcha&s;ing the Stores nece&s;&s;ary for War; and could any Man be hired to fight for a Ca&s;h that he could not pay his Debts with, but at the Option of his Creditor? And who is there that would part with any Kind of Stores for a Piece of Paper that &s;hould only be u&s;e|ful at the Will of another that might think proper to deal with him? If then it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;uch Notes &s;hould be a current Tender in &s;uch Ca&s;es; why not in all Ca&s;es? Why is a Debt in <HI>England</HI> of greater Dignity? Kings indeed have a ju&s;t Right to &s;uch Exceptions, their privy Pur&s;es ought alawys to be kept &s;acred from any Touch, but that of the la&s;t In&s;tance: But Subjects have no Pretence to Immunities, one more than another, they mu&s;t all equally enjoy an Advantage, or &s;uffer a Calamity whenever it at|tends a Community. And I hope I am not arguing with Per&s;ons who do not think <HI>Virginia</HI> a Part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Com|munity. Had this Law been calculated on the Footing of the <HI>Expedient,</HI> propo&s;ed by the Memoriali&s;ts to their Lord|&s;hips, it would have carried its own In&s;ignificancy; that is, it would not have an&s;wered its Intention of rai&s;ing Men for the War, which was nece&s;&s;arily aimed at; but I &s;hall treat the <HI>Expedient</HI> in a more re&s;pectful Manner by taking full Notice of it, when it comes in its Turn, and I believe &s;hew, however prettily it might read in a Countinghou&s;e, it would meet with a quite different Fate at a Bar of Equity.</P>
<P N="2">II. WE are told in what Manner the Merchants are affect|ed by the Act.
<Q>The Inhabitants of the Colony are indebted to them in large Sums of Money. Furthermore the Mer|chants on Account of the&s;e Inhabitants are bound to the Trade&s;men of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in large Sums; both of which were by general Agreement payable in Sterling, or at the Rate of Sterling, and this by Contracts concluded long before the i&s;&s;uing of any Paper Money in <HI>Virginia.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008476_0010_102f59eed7203250">I THINK we have here a Declaration of the whole Cau&s;e of their Complaint, that is, 1&s;t, The Planters we indebted to them; 2dly, They are furthermore indebted to them; for I am per&s;uaded however artfully they may have divided on this Article of Debt, it is but one and the &s;ame Thing, that is, a Debt to the Merchants from the Planters; but it &s;eems to have been nece&s;&s;ary here to repre&s;ent the whole City, nay the &s;everal Kingdoms of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> likely to be endangered by this Act, in order to rai&s;e the greater Clamor again&s;t it. I &s;hall not do Ju&s;tice to the Weakne&s;s of this Paragraph, if I do not here take Notice of a Di&s;covery made by it, that I am &s;ure many Merchants of the City of <HI>London,</HI> have deny'd to be the Ca&s;e when charged with it in private Letters. We have had many of us for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, great Rea&s;on to own the Thing is unhappily true in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, of our being indebted. Unhappily in as much as the Generality of Creditors are a Kind of lording Tyrants over their unfortunate Debtors, notwith|&s;tanding the undoubted Securities pledged, and the annual Tribute paid in, of a very high tho' lawful Intere&s;t. And to this we do attribute (and we pre&s;ume with great Truth too) the Growth of many Innovations and <HI>arbitrary</HI> Charges (to u&s;e the Gentlemen's own Language) that have been and are every now and then brought to Account to keep the poor Dogs of Debtors deep in their Books, and render the Redemption of their Freedom impo&s;&s;ible, by thus lowering the Produce of their Commodity, that they may continue under the Obligation of &s;ending it to them alone, thro' Fear of more apparent Per&s;ecutions. I &s;ay this we knew, and we have had great Rea&s;on to believe (that notwith&s;tand|ing the Merchants always took Care to carry every Article of Goods as &s;oon as &s;hipped to the Account of the Planter) they were neverthele&s;s in Arrears to the Trade&s;men for them, from their being &s;o ob&s;ervably rated above the &s;ame Things purcha&s;ed with ready Money; but it was never cer|tainly known to be &s;o till this Declaration made, which I call a <HI>Di&s;covery,</HI> and I am much mi&s;taken if they were aware of making it, the Time they were endeavouring to intere&s;t others in their&punc; Complaints Now tho' this artful Divi&s;ion of theirs is but a weak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffort in them; yet it opens
<PB N="12" REF="008476_0011_102f5a18f7ed17c8">
to us a prodigious Aggravation of the Misfortunes of tho&s;e that are indebted to them, in as much as they are not only obliged to pay dearer, for the Nece&s;&s;aries they &s;end for, from the advanced Price of the Trade&s;men, always added for long Credit given; but are loaded with Intere&s;t in the Mer|chants Accounts on that advanced Price; which mu&s;t needs be a large annual Sum out of the Profits of the Colony, put into the Pocket of the Merchant; a Practice not &s;o well founded as to admit of a common Ju&s;tification: But I &s;hall forbear to con&s;ider this any further here, as it is an Article that may one Day make a very good Figure among&s;t many others, in a Complaint from this Side of the Water, when the Lei&s;ure of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament &s;hall admit of an Enquiry into the real Cau&s;es of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Situation of their Colonies; and &s;ome truly noble Spirit &s;hall glory in exerting it&s;elf for that Benefit, which has &s;o long been de&s;ired. &mdash; Let the Attempt be thine, O FAUQUIER, to complete thy Goodne&s;s, thine to explode and remove all unnatural and de&s;tructive Jealou&s;ies, and by thy Happine&s;s demon&s;trate to di&s;tant and &s;ucceeding Delegations, that it is the Patriot GOVERNOR alone that can repre&s;ent the Patriot KING. Nor deem thou this as a Drop bubling from the nau&s;eous Fountain of Flattery: No 'tis the Dictate of a Mind that enjoys more than Kings can confer, <HI>a contented Condition</HI>; a Mind that has no Demand again&s;t thee but what mu&s;t centre in its <HI>Country</HI>'s <HI>Good</HI>; a Mind that di&s;dains all Prai&s;e or Commendation to any dignify'd Character but &s;uch as is made truly glorious by <HI>public Virtue.</HI> Now let me a&s;k the Gentlemen how a Debt from the Planters to the Merchants came to be made an Introduction to their Com|plaints. It does indeed &s;hew a Connection they have with the Colony, but I beg Leave to &s;ay, they are not in that Connection, in the lea&s;t affected by any new Thing in the Act. They acknowledge the Debts due from the Colony, were by general Agreement di&s;chargeable in <HI>Sterling or at the Rate of Sterling Money</HI>; and does this Act &s;ay they &s;hall not be &s;o di&s;charged? No, nor was it ever intended to oper|ate in &s;uch a Manner; it &s;ays indeed, that the Paper Notes &s;o i&s;&s;ued, &s;hall be a lawful Tender in Payment of any Debt or Demand whatever, and the&s;e Words do expre&s;ly imply

<HI>ad valorem,</HI> with Re&s;pect to Sterling Debts, and it is not in the Power of the mo&s;t quibbling Petyfogger to cavil long enough to draw any other Meaning out of them. 'Tis a known Rule in the Con&s;truction of Statutes, that two Acts equally &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;hall only operate in the Manner in which they are truly reconcileable, and this for a very good Rea&s;on, otherwi&s;e every new Statute mu&s;t be extended &s;o as to take in all the Laws that are relative to the Matter contained in &s;uch Statute, which would be perhaps con&s;tructing a Volume every Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament too large for any one Man's Peru&s;al, and might be productive of great Confu&s;ion, which is too often the Ca&s;e in frequent Revi&s;als. When there|fore a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting Act has fully regulated any Matter or Thing, a &s;ucceeding Statute not expre&s;ly or virtually repealing it, &s;hall not be extended to defeat the Purpo&s;e of the preceeding Act. I will exemplify it in the Ca&s;e before us, to &s;hew the Ju&s;tice of it, tho' there &s;eems to be little Need of any Exem|plification, as there is &s;carcely a Book treating of Statutes that does not confirm it. There was an Act made in 1748, which the Memoriali&s;ts have recited, declaring that Execu|tions for Sterling Debts &s;hould be levied in Current Money at the Rate of Twenty-five per Cent. Advance on Sterling, and not otherwi&s;e. The Act in the Paper Emi&s;&s;ion in no Part either virtually or expre&s;ly repeals or contradicts it; can the Clau&s;e then, allowing the Tender of Paper Notes in Payment of any Debt whatever, mean with Re&s;pect to Sterling Debts any Thing el&s;e, but that &s;uch Tender &s;hall be made according to the Act in Force, before the making the Act for Paper Emi&s;&s;ion, and was that Law in 1748 &s;till in Force could &s;uch Tender made under the Paper Act be good, unle&s;s it had been made at the Rate of Twenty-five per Cent. And as this was the then <HI>ad valorem</HI> between Sterling and Currency, how can the Merchant be affected by the Paper Act, as to his Sterling Debt, Bargain, or Contract. This may be a Method out of the Way of Rea&s;oning with the&s;e Gentlemen, but if they will wade in Waters that they are Strangers to, they &s;hould apply to tho&s;e who are acquainted with them, before they ru&s;h into Fears and Apprehen&s;ions and expo&s;e them&s;elves by mere groundle&s;s Complaints. From hence it appears any other Con&s;truction upon the Act com|plained

of would be again&s;t the Rule of Law, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, again&s;t the Rule of common Sen&s;e too, for they might as well in my Opinion, carry the Tender in the Act to a Pay|ment of a Debt in Tobacco, which would be an Ab&s;urdity, if there was no Limitation of the Words to be allowed. The Gentlemen mu&s;t now excu&s;e me if I tell them, that altho' they have laid their Complaint again&s;t the Act, in the Defect of it with Re&s;pect to a Provi&s;ion for Sterling Debts; I cannot think that they or their Draft&s;man were really &s;o ignorant as not to know, that this Act did not &s;tand in Need of any &s;uch Clau&s;e; but that by the amending Clau&s;e in the Expedient propo&s;ed to their Lord&s;hips, they intended &s;ome Thing further, and that their &s;ole Motive for complaining was, that they &s;hould not be obliged to take the&s;e Notes at any Rate at all, but as they plea&s;ed. Should this be the Ca&s;e, they are not only Men of very <HI>inhumane Principles,</HI> but not|with&s;tanding their long Practice in the Arts of Profit and Lo&s;s, very bad <HI>Politicians,</HI> as to their particular Intere&s;t. <HI>Inhumane</HI> in that they would either compel a Man to do an Impo&s;&s;ibility, (viz.) Pay a Debt in a particular Coin, when it is not in his Power to acquire one Penny of it to do it with, or el&s;e pay it in &s;uch a Manner, as would oblige him to Part with all that he has: For if there was to be no Re&s;triction &s;et as to the Value of Sterling Money, and the Difference wholly left to the Will of the Creditor, it would be ve&s;ting &s;uch Creditor with the mo&s;t arbitrary Rule in the World, and from the very Nature of complaining in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, it would be giving up the Debtor and his dependent Connec|tions, as a Sacrifice to the certain Cruelty of the Creditor; for he that growls at the whol&s;ome Re&s;trictions Society &s;hall think proper to e&s;tabli&s;h between Man and Man, can only do it from an incompa&s;&s;ionate and devouring Temper; in vain is Charity to be expected from him who contends again&s;t Laws that have Charity for their Ba&s;is. In <HI>England</HI> indeed where all the Currency they have is a rated Sterling, there can be no Occa&s;ion for a Law of this Kind to enable the Debtor to &s;top the Per&s;ecutions of his Creditor; but in Countries where Sterling is a Coin very little &s;een, &s;uch a Law is not only &s;alutary for the Community, but highly Equitable and Ju&s;t, between Man and Man, that they &s;hould

be permitted to di&s;charge their Money Debts, of what Kind or Nature &s;oever, in the Currency of the Country in which they live, and it is the true Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Legi&s;lature to keep &s;uch Laws at all Times &s;ub&s;i&s;ting; for Man left to his own Will over his Fellow Creatures, may &s;ometimes fall into &s;uch Depravations of Mind, as to become more cruel than the mo&s;t Savage Bea&s;t of Prey. As to their Politicks, I need only put a Ca&s;e founded on a real Fact, to &s;hew how bad they are with Re&s;pect to their Debts. Sup|po&s;e a People to be &s;o circum&s;tanced as to have no Sterling at all among&s;t them, and very little of any other Coin, how can &s;uch a People be ever able to pay their Debts; few Com|modities be&s;ides their Tobacco can be exported to any certain Market, but in the Way of Barter; their Tobacco &s;eldom yields much more in <HI>England</HI> in common Crops, than is &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e Nece&s;&s;aries and pay Intere&s;t; and &s;hould an accidental foreign Trade &s;end a little of its Gold into that Country, a Tender <HI>ad valorem</HI> of that Gold, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be allowed, or that would be of little Service; if then it mu&s;t be allowed in the Ca&s;e of one &s;pecies of Cur|rency, why &s;hould it not in all Kinds; would it not then be much ea&s;ier for &s;uch Merchants to get their Debts paid by an e&s;tabli&s;hed circulating Currency, than by none at all: A Debt &s;o paid might in the Round of Trade (which Adven|turers are well acquainted with) be carried Home to <HI>England,</HI> and there centre in Sterling, with a very fair and con&s;ider|able Profit. I will now a&s;k where is the material Difference between one Kind of Currency and another with Re&s;pect to Trade or Debts; but I bar the Man of mi&s;erly Habits from giving any An&s;wer at all, he is fir&s;t for the mo&s;t Part a Stranger either to Trade or Debts, becau&s;e he can &s;carcely tru&s;t him&s;elf, how then will he tru&s;t another. Again, the Wretch conceives &s;uch an inexpre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure in the counting and poring over his Golden Guineas, that I much que&s;tion whether double the Sum in Bank-Bills would pur|cha&s;e them. 'Tis to the rational Trader alone that I apply, and &s;uch Merchants ought to be deemed; to them therefore I addre&s;s my&s;elf, and I am per&s;uaded I have their true An&s;wer in this Memorial.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="008476_0015_102f5a1f5b1e1bb0">THEY tell us, the Act for emitting Paper-Money is unju&s;t, by Rea&s;on that it depreciates the Nature of Sterling Debts, by making what was payable in a Coin of univer&s;al Value, payable in Notes of a local, uncertain, and fluctuating Value: If I under&s;tand the&s;e Terms right, we are to collect from them, that the Value of Sterling is univer&s;ally agreed upon; and that Paper Notes have no Value at all, out in the Place they are made current; and that even the Value there is uncertain, becau&s;e of its Fluctuation with Re&s;pect to the Value of Sterling: The material Difference between Paper and Sterling mu&s;t then lye in the Certainty of the one, and in the Uncertainty of the other. And is it not evident, that all other Species of Coin, with Re&s;pect to Sterling, are of the &s;ame uncertain Nature as Paper? Neither can Gold and Silver Coin be le&s;s &s;o than Paper, as it mu&s;t be rated by Sterling, the Scarcity or Plenty of which will certainly lower or advance the exchanging Difference; and to &s;ay that Gold and Silver Coin is current in more Places than the Paper Currency is, and therefore though local yet le&s;s confined, is but a Kind of begging the Que&s;tion, and when it is granted, it makes very little in the Point, for in tho&s;e Countries where Gold and Silver Coin are not current by Law, they are only to be con&s;idered as a trading Commodity, which is more or le&s;s vendible in Proportion to the Gain or Profit that is to be made by it, and there can be no In&s;tance in which a Paper Currency that can be remitted to the Country where it is made current by Law, will not be as good a Commodity in Trade as Gold and Silver, but one; that is, where the trafficking or exchanging Difference between Gold and Sil|ver and Sterling is greater than the intrin&s;ick Difference; and as this can only happen from the too great Scarcity of Sterling Trade, &s;hould an In&s;tance or two depending upon &s;uch an Accident be made &s;uch an Argument of as to decry a Paper Currency, when in every other Ca&s;e it is equal to all other Coins, except Sterling: And as to Trade or Debts, I beg Leave to &s;ay they cannot be affected by it, for the Trader has it always in his Power to &s;uit his Trade to his expected Payments; and the Sterling Debt, when paid in Paper, will always be paid in the exchanging Difference that is then circulating: To be injured, therefore, by the Paper Notes, the Trader or Creditor mu&s;t put a Ca&s;e that can only
<PB N="17" REF="008476_0016_102f59f8c722cc28">
center in his own Neglect or Avarice; his Neglect, in not negociating it away in Time, before Exchange &s;hall ri&s;e; Avarice, in keeping it by him, in Expectation that the Ex|change is &s;till falling, and from thence propo&s;ing a farther Gain to him&s;elf. Tho&s;e who tell us, that Paper Currency has a farther Difference from Gold and Silver Coins, in that it is difficult to be realized; if they mean it is difficult to turn an E&s;tate in Paper Notes into a landed, or any other permanent E&s;tate, I an&s;wer it cannot be more &s;o in that than it would be in other Coins, when the Act is con&s;idered; for that does ab&s;olutely bar all Difference between them, and when an E&s;tate becomes vendible, it cannot by Law be of more Value in one than another: A Man, indeed, of a mi&s;erly Di&s;po&s;ition might be tempted to part with a Tract of Land for Gold, when he would not for Paper; but that Gold he mu&s;t keep u&s;ele&s;s, or clande&s;tinely exchange it; for if he does it openly, he can get no more for it than if it was Paper. Should a Man want to realize it, as they call it in <HI>England,</HI> he can as ea&s;ily exchange it for Bills as Gold, if he does not care to venture it in the Commodity of the Country; and in no In&s;tance does it differ with Re&s;pect to realizing from Gold and Silver Coins, but in the before-mentioned one, where the Plenty of &s;uch Coin &s;hall &s;o far exceed the Sterling Trade, as to make the exchanging Dif|ference greater than the intrin&s;ick: And thus, at la&s;t, does this Difficulty of realizing become greater in the one than the other, by the &s;ame Accident which I have before men|tioned, and which mu&s;t be &s;o rare as &s;carcely to happen twice in a Man's Life. I am pretty well &s;ati&s;fied, that the&s;e Arguments again&s;t the <HI>Virginia</HI> Paper Currency have been adopted from the Practice of other Colonies, where they have both Gold and Silver, and Paper Currencies, at a great Difference with Re&s;pect to each other; but it &s;hould be con|&s;idered, that it is there a profitable Trade to the cunning Merchants, and that no Provi&s;ion (as I am informed) was ever made again&s;t it in the Acts that emitted the Paper: But in <HI>Virginia</HI> this is in a great Mea&s;ure prevented, and will be more &s;o, as the Iniquities of &s;uch Trade &s;hall from Time to Time be di&s;covered; but here I beg Pardon for a Digre&s;|&s;ion;

I &s;hall now con&s;ider the <HI>Arbitrarine&s;s,</HI> and Inju&s;tice charged on the Act by the Memoriali&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE Act they &s;ay not only inverts the Nature of Trade from a certain to an uncertain Value of Profit and Lo&s;s; but it extends <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> to Debts due on Bargains and Contracts made before the Pa&s;&s;ing of the Act, and therefore it is <HI>arbitrary.</HI> I was &s;omething puzzled to fix a Meaning to the certain Value of Profit and Lo&s;s in Trade, which this Act has over&s;et, becau&s;e from all the Ideas I could collect of Trade, it can have very little Certainty in it; there is always a Probability in it, and &s;ome Trades are more probable as to their Succe&s;s than others; but as I know it was a Complaint again&s;t the Act, I have endeavoured to extract a Meaning out of it: That is, that before the Making of the Act, they u&s;ed to Trade for Sterling only, which they call a Trade of certain Value, and &s;ince the Act they are obliged to Trade for Paper Currency, which is of uncertain Value. If this is the Accu&s;ation, I beg Leave to &s;ay, it is a Mi&s;take, for they did not, nor could they trade any more for Sterling before the Making of the Act, than they do, or can &s;ince the Act; that is before the Act there was always a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting Currency in the Country, which they were obliged to take in Exchange for Sterling, trade how they would, and this Act does no more than introduce a new Kind of Currency, which the&s;e Gentlemen, as I have already &s;hewn, are only plea&s;ed to think meanly of, not that it materially differs from the Currency that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted before the making of the Act: Their Accu&s;ation therefore as to its inverting of Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is vague and idle, and their <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> is of the &s;ame Stamp; they are Words that do not de&s;erve my Notice, only to expo&s;e the Scheme couched in them, they know they give a retro&s;pective Ca&s;t to the Act, and &s;uch is the popular Cry again&s;t a Retro&s;pection in Statutes, that it is like bawling out a mad Dog in the Streets, which has been the Cau&s;e of violent Deaths to many an harmle&s;s and u&s;eful Cur. But I will fir&s;t &s;atisfy tho&s;e who &s;hall read me, that it is a Complaint ill founded, and then &s;hew the&s;e Gentlemen, that whatever the common and vulgar Opinion may be of retro&s;pective Acts, they may be the mo&s;t &s;alutary Acts imaginable to a Community in &s;ome In&s;tances.</P>

I &s;ay no Part of this is true, but that the Debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were contracted before the Act: And how does this Act extend to &s;uch Debts? In no other Manner than what they were always extended to, and mu&s;t from the very Nature of Things have been extended to as &s;oon as ever a Debt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly have been contracted: I &s;ay it mu&s;t from the very Nature and Rea&s;on of Things, have been a Rule that every Per&s;on trading from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in a Country where the particu|lar Currency of that Country was of le&s;s Value than Sterling, that &s;uch Trader &s;hould be obliged to take his Debt or Con|tract in &s;uch Country, at &s;ome certain Di&s;count, between the Currency of &s;uch Country and Sterling, or he mu&s;t have traded &s;olely by Barter; and if any one will give him&s;elf the Trouble of enquiring Back into the Hi&s;tory of Exchange and Trade in this Colony, he will find that for a long Time, the Riches of the People, lying more in Sterling than Cur|rency, from that over Balance, the Difference of Exchange was fir&s;t on the Side of Currency. I can charge my Memory with having read old Letters, wherein one per Cent. Sterling, was given for one Hundred Pounds Currency. And this &s;eems to be the Rea&s;on of tho&s;e Acts now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among&s;t us (tho' very little regared) prohibiting the Exportation of Ca&s;h under large Penalties, and of tho&s;e other Acts (now &s;o iniquitou&s;ly extended) giving Encouragement for the Impor|tation of Ca&s;h: In Time as the Quantity of Ca&s;h encrea&s;ed, Sterling claimed a &s;uperior Value, and as the Riches of the Country declined in Sterling, the exchanging Value en|crea&s;ed; during all which Time the Trader mu&s;t have &s;uited him&s;elf to the Po&s;&s;ibility of his Chapman, and the Creditor to that of his Debtor; but when Men became &s;o extravagant as to pay no Regard to &s;ocial Good, but governed their Demands wholly by Avarice, let it undo where it would; then the Law in 1748, came in to Remedy the Evil where it could, by taking Cognizance of the Claim of the Creditor, and &s;o ultimately confining the Trader; and if he could not be contented with a rea&s;onable Exchange, the Proce&s;s brought again&s;t the Debtor, ended in a Regulation
<PB N="20" REF="008476_0019_102f5a28cc8d8bf8">
of the Exchange between Sterling and Currency, as the Legi&s;la+ture then thought was mo&s;t rea&s;onable: But this Limitation of Exchange to a certain Standard always, was by the&s;e very Gentlemen exclaimed again&s;t (as I &s;hall &s;hew them pre&s;ently, to give the World the true Complexion of this Memo|rial) and the Legi&s;lature then fell on the be&s;t and mo&s;t equi|table Rule, than can be devi&s;ed by Man, for the di&s;pen&s;ing of Ju&s;tice to the Creditor and pre&s;erving the unfortunate Debtor from his mercile&s;s Claws; by directing Courts to Rate the Value of their Sterling Judgments given, in Current Money, according to the general and mo&s;t known exchang|ing Difference &s;o that the Creditor, was ju&s;tly dealt with, and always had Ca&s;h in &s;uch a Proportion, as might enable him to replace his Sterling Debt in <HI>England,</HI> if he plea&s;ed. Thus the Rule, which Rea&s;on and Nature dictated &s;hould be &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, became the Rule e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, and did &s;ub&s;i&s;t before the Act, for emitting Paper Currency. I hope it is now evident the Act has done nothing <HI>ex po&s;t facto,</HI> it has enacted no new Thing with Regard to any Sort of Debts, but only directed that for &s;uch a Time, &s;uch Notes &s;hould have all the Value, that any other Species of Currency had: If it &s;hould be &s;aid that although Sterling Judgments were before the Act, to be rated in Currency, yet &s;uch Cur|rency was no Tender in Law, at it is in this Act; I an&s;wer, it is a mere Lawyer's Quibble, and if it was not expre&s;ly declared &s;o in former Acts, yet it was virtually, and con&s;e|quentially &s;o done, in that every Creditor mu&s;t know he could recover no more than the real Difference of Exchange; and &s;urely that Court where it &s;hould appear that the Debtor had made the Creditor a Tender of the full Exchange on his Debt, mu&s;t have treated &s;uch Creditor on his Refu&s;al, as a litigious Per&s;on.</P>
<P>AS to retro&s;pective Statutes, I need do no more than mention a common Propo&s;ition, to prove that notwith&s;tand|ing popular Clamor, they are often very expedient.

To &s;ay they ought is to fix the Infallibility of human Under|&s;tanding, as to Cau&s;es, Effects, and Con&s;equences, which is an Ab&s;urdity.

and that whil&s;t Creditors were govern'd by the real or exchang|ing Difference &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, it remained only an equitable Rule, nece&s;&s;arilly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things; but when Avarice admitted of no Bounds to their Demands, the A&s;&s;embly in 1748, took the Ca&s;e under their Con&s;ider|ation, and to do Ju&s;tice to both Creditor and Debtor, made all Executions on Sterling Debts leviable at Twenty-five per Cent. which was then thought the common and rea&s;onable Exchange: But the Law was not long known in <HI>England,</HI> before the Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> whom I &s;uppo&s;e I may &s;afely call the Memoriali&s;ts, endeavoured to obtain a Repeal of it, by the King's Proclamation; how|ever they were given to under&s;tand it was con&s;titutionally late, for a Repeal by Proclamation, as his Maje&s;ty had given his A&s;&s;ent to the Act. And an In&s;truction was accordingly &s;ent to the Governor, to urge the A&s;&s;embly (as tho&s;e Gentlemen term it) to do it by a &s;ub&s;equent Act. The A&s;&s;embly always endeavouring to avoid giving the lea&s;t Color for a Complaint again&s;t them, then readily embraced the Opportunity, and with great Alacrity, pa&s;&s;ed a Law to Repeal that in 1748, and &s;o enacted, that all Courts on any Judgment given in Sterling, &s;hould at the Time of pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch Judgment, &s;ettle at what Rate of Di&s;count, the &s;ame &s;hould be leviable in Current Money. Now let any candid Man &s;ay what the&s;e Memoriali&s;ts would be at: A Clau&s;e is wanted in the Paper Act to provide for the Payment of Ster|ling <HI>ad valorem,</HI> and it is &s;o done and practi&s;ed before and after the making of the Act. Again, the Act in 1748, is likely to injure them, when in Fact there is no &s;uch Law in Being: Surely the&s;e Things can hardly be called common Mi&s;takes, no, they are gro&s;s <HI>Blunders,</HI> begotten by a Genius for <HI>Clamoring.</HI> I now again hope this Act is not only cleared of all <HI>Arbitrarine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Inju&s;tice,</HI> but that it ju&s;tly rides in Triumph over the Memorial, and all its devili&s;h Machina|tions, for certainly calumniating In&s;inuations, and fal&s;e Accu&s;ations, are Satan's chief Implements.</P>
<P>I WILL now con&s;ider the Expedient propo&s;ed by the&s;e Gentlemen, and that minutely too, to &s;hew how little de|&s;erving of Regard this Body are in this In&s;tance, however
<PB N="23" REF="008476_0022_102f5a044ca85758">
formidably they may have united; and indeed to &s;hew how nece&s;&s;ary it is to pre&s;erve the Ju&s;tice due to every Cau&s;e, by hearing both Parties fully before a Determination &s;hould be given.</P>
<P>TO &s;eparate the Expedient from its great Bundle of Preamble, is &s;imply to &s;ay, it is an Amendment to the Paper Act. 1&s;t, To &s;ecure all Contracts before the pa&s;&s;ing the Act from any Effect at all by it. 2dly, That in all Ca&s;es of Sterling Debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;tipulated payable in Sterling either before or after the Act, &s;uch Debts. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall not be effected by a Tender of Paper, or any other Species of Cur|rency not being Sterling at any Rate, unle&s;s the Creditor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall con&s;ent to it; and if he does con&s;ent to it and takes the Money, that then he &s;hall be deemed in Law, fully &s;atisfy'd for his Debt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I CANNOT here pa&s;s over a Compliment due to the Gentlemen, on Account of their Happine&s;s in the Choice of a Draft&s;man, who has di&s;covered in the Memorial, a wonderful Dexterity in &s;plitting Unities; that is, dividing one and the &s;ame Thing into &s;everal Parts, for the Sake of multiplying Sentences: The wi&s;er Part of Mankind has indeed condemned the Practice as non|&s;en&s;ical, but a bad Cau&s;e (or rather no Cau&s;e at all) for com|plaining, &s;hould be rolled up in an abundant Di&s;gui&s;e of Words. The fir&s;t Part of the Amendment propo&s;ed is wholly to &s;ecure Debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made before the Act from be|ing affected by it. And what does the &s;econd Part of the Amendment propo&s;e? Nothing more than to &s;ecure all Ster|ling Debts, made both before and after the Act, from being affected by it; for I conceive it wants no written Law to tell a Man if his Creditor is willing to di&s;charge his Debt, for Carrots or Turnips, he may pay them to him; and that after he has paid them, and the Creditor has taken them as &s;uch, he is certainly di&s;charged from any further Claim on Account of that Debt or Contract; and for this he has the Law of common Sen&s;e to direct him. But now for the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of &s;uch an Amendment, which not only &s;trikes at the Paper Act, but at all Rules and Acts relative to the exchang|ing
<PB N="24" REF="008476_0023_102f5a2d48d450a0">
of current Money, and of Cour&s;e at the Law of nece&s;|&s;ary Ju&s;tice, before explained; when I &s;ay the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of &s;uch an Amendment, I mean not the Amendment as it is worded, for verily that is mere formal Non&s;en&s;e, but of any Amendment to &s;ecure the&s;e Sterling Debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from being paid by Law in the Currency of the Country <HI>ad va|lorem,</HI> for that is the certain Drift of the Memoriali&s;ts; a Drift they did not care to be plain in di&s;covering, when they charged the Paper Act as being defective with Re&s;pect to Ster|ling Debts: In this Kind, indeed, it is defective; and had it been otherwi&s;e, it would have been the mo&s;t fallacious Act imaginable, by emitting a Currency that &s;hould be no where current, not &s;o current as a Ca&s;k of Nails, or any other Com|modity, to be &s;old only to him that might want to buy them, for any Man might hold what he had to &s;ell at a Sterling De|mand, and then of what Wotrh would the Paper Notes have been? I need &s;ay nothing more to &s;uch an Amendment, than to remind any Reader of the Nece&s;&s;ity that mu&s;t have always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted of exchanging (not only in <HI>Virginia,</HI> but in every Country where Sterling is not the &s;ole Currency) Sterling for &s;uch Currency, at an agreed Rate; and that it was from this Nece&s;&s;ity alone that any Law could ever have ari&s;en to e&s;tabli&s;h the Method of doing it, le&s;t the Will of the Cre|ditor &s;hould grow too extravagant for the Capacity of the Debtor; all which, I flatter my&s;elf, I have fully &s;hewn in my Ob&s;ervations already made on this Memorial. I &s;hould now take Leave of the Expedient, but that there is a &s;eeming Arrogancy in concluding that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the A&s;&s;em|bly of <HI>Virginia</HI> to make any Objections to the Amendment, in &s;o far as it is, <HI>bona fide,</HI> founded on Principles of <HI>common Ju&s;tice,</HI> and the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> What, do the Principles of common Ju&s;tice oblige a People, extending the Power of a Mother-Country, by improving her di&s;tant Territories, and in doing that, confined (except in &s;ome trifling Com|modities) &s;olely to a Trade with that Mother-Country? I &s;ay, &s;hould &s;uch a People, in the Cour&s;e of &s;uch Trade, fall in Debt to &s;uch Mother-Country, do the Principles of <HI>com|mon Ju&s;tice</HI> enjoin, that Per&s;ons &s;o circum&s;tanced &s;hould not be allowed any Way of paying &s;uch Debts, but in a Coin of which there is hardly an Hundred Pounds to be found

among&s;t them in a Year; or el&s;e to pay them according to the extravagant Demands that their Creditors &s;hall make in the Currency they have: Gentlemen that talk &s;o, mu&s;t be Madmen; is this <HI>common Ju&s;tice?</HI> It is, <HI>bona fide, unnatural, and again&s;t all Ju&s;tice.</HI> Again, the Amendment (they &s;ay) is founded on the Laws of <HI>England</HI>; to this I an&s;wer, with|out entering into a critical Enquiry as to the Fact, and with all po&s;&s;ible Deference, that if there be &s;uch a Law, as the Laws of no People on Earth &s;hould be unalterable, every Moment that it has had any Effect in the Manner that the&s;e Memoriali&s;ts propo&s;e, it mu&s;t have been grievou&s;ly partial and burthen&s;ome; and therefore it ought now to change its Face, and &s;mile on tho&s;e who have de&s;erved all Attention, and every rea&s;onable Indulgence; who, in Spite of Poverty and every unnatural Check, have certainly convinced the World, that they are faithful Subjects, endued with that Noblene&s;s of Spirit that has ever di&s;tingui&s;hed a true-born <HI>Briton.</HI></P>
<P>THE Conclu&s;ion is of a Piece with the whole Memorial, that runs on with a very great Air of Importance, but com|plains of <HI>nothing real</HI>; and this, it is evident, is as pompou&s;ly inclined to the &s;ame Point, <HI>Nothing.</HI> There is a Reque&s;t made to their Lord&s;hips, that they would be plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;|pend giving Judgment on the <HI>Virginia</HI> Act as it now &s;tands, by Way of Approbation thereof, till &s;uch Time as the Sen&s;e of the A&s;&s;embly of the Province is had upon the Amendments propo&s;ed thereto; which, in Fact, is de&s;iring that their Lord|&s;hips would let the Act keep its Force and Efficacy, which every Act mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily do that is p&s;&s;ed by the Governor, unle&s;s his Maje&s;ty &s;hall declare his Di&s;&s;ent by Proclamation, which no Doubt he is in &s;ome Ca&s;es advi&s;ed to: But, if the Act lyes for his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure, it is nece&s;&s;arily operating here as a Law, unle&s;s provided again&s;t in the Body of it by a &s;u&s;pending Clau&s;e. Their Lord&s;hips Approbation of an Act might indeed incline his Maje&s;ty to give his A&s;&s;ent to it, and thereby give it a greater Degree of Firmne&s;s in the Con&s;titution; but this can hardly be very nece&s;&s;ary, in many temporary Laws: Of Cour&s;e then the&s;e Gentlemen have really a&s;ked for <HI>nothing,</HI> with Re&s;pect to their Complaint;
<PB N="26" REF="008476_0025_102f5a31574229a0">
not only <HI>nothing</HI> to their Purpo&s;e, but &s;o long as their Re|que&s;t is granted; that is, that their Lord&s;hips &s;hall be &s;ilent as to their Approbation of the Act. It is very mate|rially again&s;t them; but I have all along &s;een they have a latent Meaning in the Memorial, and I &s;u&s;pect here they are praying that their Lord&s;hips will &s;u&s;pend their Approbation, in order to offer up another Prayer hereafter, that they will be plea&s;ed to advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty to repeal it; and this Con|&s;truction is not out of the Way of their partial Sy&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re|fully kept up through the whole: But would not this be a mo&s;t extraordinary Prayer indeed, fir&s;t to let an Act emit Money at &s;uch a &s;ettled Currency and on &s;uch a &s;ettled Fund, and, when the Money is in Circulation, repeal it, becau&s;e <HI>Lon|don</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Merchants are put on the nece&s;&s;ary and ju&s;t Footing with other People.
