<HEAD>INSTITUTION OF THE Bo&s;ton Di&s;pen&s;ary.</HEAD>
<P>IT having been found by experience, both in Europe and in &s;everal of the capital towns in America, that Di&s;pen&s;aries for the medical relief of the Poor are the mo&s;t u&s;eful among benevolent In&s;titutions, a number of Gentlemen propo&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h a public Di&s;pen&s;ary in the Town of Bo&s;ton, for the relief of the &s;ick poor, which they pre|&s;ume will embrace the following advantages.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The &s;ick, without being pained by a &s;eparation from their families, may be at|tended and relieved in their own hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Secondly, The &s;ick can, in this way, be a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a le&s;s expence to the public than in an ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Tho&s;e who have &s;een better days may be comforted without being humili|ated: And all the poor receive the bene|fits of a charity the more refined, as it is the more &s;ecret.</P>
