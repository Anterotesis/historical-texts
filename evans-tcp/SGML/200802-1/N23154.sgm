<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MATTHIAS GOTLEIB was born in Pru&s;&s;ia, and early in life en|gaged as a Soldier, and went through various &s;cenes common to that calling, which we think not worth relating here: One thing however, he was re|markable for de&s;erting his po&s;t and ar|my, and li&s;ting again from time to time, 'till he came to America, during the late war with Britain. After &s;et|tling and moving &s;everal times, he came to Newton, in New-Jer&s;ey, where he perpetrated the following act, of murdering his wife.</P>
<P>"On the 19th day of December, 1795, he was about the village as u&s;u|al, and returned home intoxicated; his wife being di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee him in that &s;ituation, began to find fault with his conduct&mdash;he immediately got his
<PB N="3" REF="030607_0003_0FE81C4051262EB8">
butcher-knife, and a&s;ked his &s;on for a whet-&s;tone, but the boy's mother or|dered him to his work, which he o|beyed. Gotleib then whet his knife on a board, and proceeded to &s;tab his wife; he gave her three &s;eperate &s;tabs, one of which proved to be mortal, by pa&s;&s;ing through one of her inte&s;tines. He then attempted to make his e&s;cape, but was apprehended and confined in pri&s;on. The unfortunate woman died the fifth day following, and a Coroner's inque&s;t &s;at over her body, of twenty-three good and lawful men; four &s;ur|geons were called to di&s;&s;ect and exa|mine the body, and gave their opinion thereon&mdash;after the jurors had heard the te&s;timony of the &s;urgeons and witne&s;|&s;es, they found a verdict of wilful mur|der, committed by the hand of Mat|thias Gotleib. He continued in Jail 'till October 1796, when he was tried and convicted, by the mo&s;t po&s;itive e|vidence, and executed accordingly.</P>

<P>THE words that I have cho&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, as the foundation of the following di&s;cour&s;e, are recorded in
<Q><BIBL><HI>Gene&s;is, IX, 6.</HI></BIBL>
<HI>"Who&s;o &s;heddeth mans blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed: for in the image of God made he man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IT appears from the latter clau&s;e of our text, that man was in his original formation, like his Maker, in &s;ome good degree; his being in the image of God, mu&s;t denote his bearing &s;ome re&s;emblance to God, is his perfections&mdash;as we find &s;ome traces in man's paradi&s;iacal &s;tate of holine&s;s, rec|titude and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS man was a noble creature, when he came from the hands of his Creator&mdash;endowed with &s;uperior faculties of mind and traquility of di&s;po&s;ition. Thus by creation all men are brethren and all nations of one blood; and indeed there are many con&s;iderations which &s;hould make us protect and love each other, as belonging to one great family&mdash;this appears not only from creation, but by Providence, which provides abundantly for us all; e&s;pecially, con&s;idering our|&s;elves as chri&s;tians, our obligations are &s;till &s;tronger, to love and protect each other. But the&s;e con&s;iderations have not been kept in view, nor attended to&mdash;and many of the hu|man &s;pecies have given them&s;elves up to blood-&s;hed and mur|der, ever &s;ince the &s;eduction of our fir&s;t parents. Soon after the fall, we find wicked Cain murdering his righteous bro|ther Abel. A bare catalogue of tho&s;e individuals that have murdered each other, from that period to this, would form a large volume. But God has declared, who&s;o &s;heddeth mans blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed.</P>
<P>IN farther pro&s;ecuting this &s;ubject, I &s;hall
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. STATE a number of tho&s;e &s;ins which ends in death, ei|ther temporal or eternal, except repentance takes place in the heart.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. ENDEAVOUR to &s;hew the propriety of that law of God and man, that annexes death to murder.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="030607_0005_0FE81C481E0D63D0">III. MAKE an improvement &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>AND fir&s;t of tho&s;e &s;ins that end in death without repent|ance.</P>
<P>BLASPHEMY again&s;t God and profane &s;wearing, although di&s;regarded by many, not being puni&s;hed generally by the laws of man; but God who is jealous of his glory, has &s;trictly forbidden it, tho&s;e who are guilty of this vile prac|tice, may remember that they are accountable to the great legi&s;lator of the univer&s;e, under who&s;e government, without repentance, they mu&s;t be puni&s;hed with eternal death. Neg|lecting or de&s;pi&s;ing of the Sabbath, &s;ubjects every ridiculer of that &s;acred day, to the ju&s;t indignation of God, who is de&s;pi&s;ed by the&s;e profane &s;coffers.</P>
<P>THE de&s;pi&s;ing of relative duties, come under the penalty of the divine law; as di&s;obedience to parents, turbulence to &s;uperiors, faction and di&s;cord in &s;ociety without ju&s;t cau&s;e; to which we may add, &s;tealing, which is puni&s;hable by our laws, together with adultery, which tends to de&s;troy the good order of &s;ociety, and was by the Jews puni&s;hed with &s;toneing to death, by the Congregation: Although now de&s;|pi&s;ed by the vicious, will tend to their final ruin, unle&s;s &s;in|cere repentance takes place in the heart.</P>
<P>IN this catalogue of &s;ins, lying and drunkenne&s;s, &s;hould not be con&s;idered as the lea&s;t criminal; lying is not only odious, but tends to deface all truth, and the a&s;certaining of facts; drunkenne&s;s gradually undermines and ruins the be&s;t con&s;titution, it expends what Providence has allowed us, and frequently cau&s;es poor families to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>AND here murder comes in a &s;trong point of light. Mur|der is ba&s;e and unnatural, it is invading the prerogative of God's government; right of human &s;ociety, the perpetra|tors ought to be con&s;idered as the enemies of God and man.</P>
<P>WE learn from the holy &s;criptures, how a ju&s;t God, will deal with tho&s;e abominable &s;inners.</P>
<P>MURDERERS, whoremongers, and all lyers, &s;hall have their
<PB N="6" REF="030607_0006_0FE81C49A9C7A208" MS="y">
part in the lake which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd death. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> 21.8.</NOTE></P>
<P>ALL wilful &s;in, of whatever kind, leads to mi&s;ery here, and mi&s;ery hereafter, bani&s;hment from all good, and con|finement to all evil.</P>
<P>THIS brings us to the &s;econd propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="2">II. WHICH was to &s;hew the propriety of that law of God and man, that annexes death to murder.</P>
<P N="1">1. SEVERITY is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary, from the heinou&s;|ne&s;s and nature of this crime. It is a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ys con&s;idered among the blacke&s;t of crimes, to murder a fellow creature; to mark it with the greate&s;t di&s;grace and &s;hame, to deter o|thers from the like offence. If this was not the ca&s;e, ma&s;|&s;acres would become more frequent, and no man's life would be in any degree of &s;afety.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT mu&s;t be right and proper; as it comes from God, who is all perfection, wi&s;dom, power, ju&s;tice, and mercy: His wi&s;dom has fired upon this puni&s;hment, who knows the whole nature of man.</P>
<P>THE power of that God, who made all worlds, is able to di&s;cover and have it puni&s;hed; hence murder, by &s;ome mean or other, is generally found out; yes always, for if not in this world, it will &s;urely be in the next. For ju&s;tice mu&s;t be executed, and mercy it&s;elf does not forbid it; for the &s;ame God that has declared, that, he that &s;heddeth mans blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed, is all mercy as well as ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE propriety of this, appears from its having been &s;o general, in mo&s;t of the nations of the earth, publicly exe|cute murderers; yes, many that are unacquainted with the &s;criptures. To confirm our opinion, we have the &s;ence of ancient and modern nations; of &s;o many millions of wi&s;e Legi&s;lators and great Philo&s;ophers. The wi&s;e king of I&s;rael, &s;ays, in the multitude of coun&s;ellors, there is &s;afety&mdash;and in|deed it appears &s;o, from the rea&s;on and nature of things;
<PB N="7" REF="030607_0007_0FE81C4FE440BF18">
that he who takes the life of another unju&s;tly, &s;hall loo&s;e or forfeit his own in con&s;equence of it. It is nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the unalienable rights of &s;ociety, that every man &s;hould be protected by the laws of his county; and if any body of law-givers, &s;hould alleviate this puni&s;hment, who would be willing to be a citizen of that community.</P>
<P N="3">3. AS we are fully convinced, of the propriety and ju&s;|tice of this law, as it has its &s;anction from God and man; we &s;hould not he&s;itate to do our duty in our &s;everal depart|ments, to &s;ee the law put in full execution, notwith&s;tanding our feelings of &s;ympathy&mdash;for a law, however ju&s;t and righ|teous, if not put in force, proves no avail, but hardens and increa&s;es the offenders.</P>
<P>THIS brings us to make an improvement, &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may learn from this &s;ubject, the danger of all &s;in, as it leads to death temporal or eternal&mdash;God is holy, and all &s;in is dete&s;table in his &s;ight, and mu&s;t be puni&s;hed here or hereafter; and if repentance is not exerci&s;ed, both in &s;ome in&s;tances.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may learn from this &s;ubject, the danger of &s;maller &s;ins, as they lead to greater, till the con&s;cience becomes feared, and no crime is too great to perpetrate.</P>
<P>PERHAPS few, who are brought to the gallows, for wilful murder, but what advance from &s;tealing, lying, drunken|ne&s;s, and various wicked practices, till at la&s;t they imbrue their hands in human blood.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE might take notice, from the circum&s;tances before us, the degrees of wickedne&s;s, in murder it&s;elf. Is it &s;inful to murder a &s;tranger? A di&s;tant relation? It is &s;till more &s;o to murder a brother, a &s;i&s;ter, a child! In a higher degree, it is abominable to murder a Father or Mother; but above all, a bo&s;om companion&mdash;a wife&mdash;the partner of our joys&mdash; the &s;oother of our mi&s;eries! E&s;pecially the hu&s;band, the pro|tector, turning into the butcher, is horrible in every point of view.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="8" REF="030607_0008_0FE7EBB4F4630A90">4. AND to you poor criminal, do not think that we wi&s;h to in&s;ult you&mdash;no, we only wi&s;h to impre&s;s you with a feel|ing &s;en&s;e of your crime, and the aggravated nature of your &s;ins. You have robbed your poor children of their Mother, and now the law of God and man, mu&s;t take your life al&s;o, &s;o that they are &s;tripped of their Father and Mother. May God in his mercy take care of the orphans. I hope, yes believe, you feel &s;orry for what you have done. Give your&s;elf up to &s;incere repentance and brokenne&s;s of heart, for your offences. Pardon may be po&s;&s;ible&mdash;God is gracious to the true penitent&mdash;plead for his mercy, in and through the merits and attonement of Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;&s;trip your&s;elf of all &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s and creature performance.</P>
<P N="8">8. YOU have ju&s;tly forfeited your life to the &s;tate and laws of our land&mdash;you have but a few moments to live&mdash;your gla&s;s is almo&s;t run&mdash;you are forbiden to behold the ri&s;ing of yonder fun again&mdash;to you it will &s;et with eternal night&mdash;you mu&s;t &s;oon appear at the awful bar of Almighty God.&mdash;God pity and have mercy upon you.&mdash;Farewel.</P>
<P N="9">9. SHALL we clo&s;e this memorable &s;cene, without a word to the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee that this man mu&s;t now die&mdash;do not ridicule him &mdash;but pray to God to keep you from tho&s;e &s;ins which led him to this horrid act&mdash;remember all &s;in is dete&s;table to God and Chri&s;t, and will come upon &s;inners in an unexpected hour, when ye think not&mdash;be ye therefore al&s;o ready.&mdash;Avoid all &s;in, e&s;pecially drunkenne&s;s, which urged on this man to mur|der his wife and companion.&mdash;Remember an intoxicated man loo&s;es much of his rea&s;on, and turns into the &s;cale of the inferior animals; avoid particularly, the ri&s;ing of your pa&s;|&s;ions&mdash;an angry man is an outrageous and de&s;perate creature. May the example before us, &s;erve as a warning to us all.&mdash; May God give us &s;incere contrition of &s;oul, for all our &s;ins, and accept of us through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
