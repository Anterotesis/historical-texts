<BIBL>PSALM CXXII. 8.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>For my Brethren and Companions Sakes, I will now &s;ay, Peace be within thee.</HI></Q>

<P>THIS p&s;alm, and indeed the whole book of p&s;alms, was for the mo&s;t part compo&s;ed by David, and publi&s;hes the glory of its author more than the mo&s;t pompous elogies; and we find the author of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus has con&s;ecrated this epitaph to his memory, which is more durable than either marble or bra&s;s; as the fat (&s;ays he) was taken away from the peace offering, &s;o was David cho&s;en out of the people of I&s;rael: He played with lions as with kids, and with bears as with lambs: He &s;lew a giant when he was young, and took away reproach from the people: For he called upon the Mo&s;t High Lord, and He gave &s;trength to this mighty warrior, and to &s;et up the horn of his people, &s;o the people honored him with ten thou&s;ands; and prai&s;ed him in ble&s;&s;ings of the Lord: For he de&s;troyed the enemies on every &s;ide, and brought to nought the Phili&s;tines his adver&s;aries: In all his works he rai&s;ed the Holy One Mo&s;t High; and ble&s;&s;ed the Lord with words of glory; the Lord took away his &s;ins, and and exalted his horn forever: He gave him a co|venant

of Kings, and a throne of glory in I&s;rael&mdash;He was, it is evident, very &s;ollicitous for the wel|fare of Jeru&s;alem; and therefore we find him in our context calling upon others to pray for its wel|fare; for all good to it, particularly that its inha|bitants might be united among&s;t them&s;elves, and that they might be pre&s;erved from the incur&s;ions of enemies: He encourages them thus to &s;eek the public welfare, by a&s;&s;uring them, that in &s;o doing they &s;eek their own: He is de&s;irous of the pre&s;er|vation of peace in the fortifications of Jeru&s;alem; or, if they &s;hould be attacked at any time, they might not be taken, but be a means of &s;ecuring the city: He wi&s;hes pro&s;perity to the great men, who have the conduct of public affairs, and in|deed to all his &s;ubjects; for all the&s;e he di&s;covers a cordial affection; accordingly when he &s;ees all the tribes cheerfully re&s;orting to the te&s;timony of I&s;rael, and finds it to be a &s;ettled point, that Jeru|&s;alem mu&s;t be the place, where God will record his name: He does not &s;ay, let the prie&s;ts and the prophets who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, and the people who have nothing el&s;e to do, pray, and I'll fight for the public peace: no, but now he &s;ays him&s;elf, peace be within thee, i. e. Jeru&s;alem&mdash;&s;eemingly re&s;olved to do every thing in his power for the public good: It is true Jeru&s;alem was his own city, and the intere&s;ts of his family were lodged in it: but it does not appear, that his own &s;ecurity and the glory of his empire were chiefly in his view; no, but he was de&s;irous of peace and pro&s;|perity, for the &s;ake of all his fellow citizens, and of all the I&s;raelites, whom, though his &s;ubjects, he owned for his brethren and companions in the chief privileges and ble&s;&s;ings enjoyed at Jeru&s;a|lem.</P>

What I propo&s;e from the words, cho&s;en for the foundation of a di&s;cour&s;e on this occa&s;ion, is,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place to &s;hew, what we are here to under&s;tand by Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>And in the &s;econd place, what by the peace to be wi&s;hed for to it.</P>
<P>And, by Jeru&s;alem in our day, we are to un|der&s;tand the chri&s;tian church.&mdash;When David &s;pake the&s;e words he had re&s;pect to the Jewi&s;h church, which was then the only vi&s;ible people God had in the world: But under the go&s;pel the chri&s;tian churches are the circumci&s;ion: They are God's people, and the promi&s;es of God to his people belong to them: But it is the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t in general, perhaps, that we are here to under&s;tand by Jeru&s;alem; for David &s;eems here to re&s;olve to &s;eek the pro&s;perity of Jeru&s;alem for his brethren and companions &s;ake: And God, who&s;e kingdom rules over all, does, in his unerring Pro|vidence, make un&s;ound profe&s;&s;ors to be &s;ometimes as an hedge about his own people: And the ca&s;e is &s;uch, that the pulling up of the tares endangers the wheat al&s;o; and further &s;till there may be, and there is rea&s;on to hope, that many who are now only vi&s;ible chri&s;tians, are cho&s;en of God, and &s;hall in due time be called into his kingdom, the kingdom of grace: And accordingly we find that Chri&s;t prayed for his &s;heep of the other fold, or for tho&s;e that were not yet called: And thus &s;hould chri&s;tians wi&s;h and pray for the pro&s;perity of Jeru&s;alem. We are not by Jeru&s;alem here to under&s;tand one particular church only, or &s;ociety of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians; but all the churches of &s;uch
<PB N="6" REF="012545_0005_0F8ADBBF5EBB4770">
profe&s;&s;ors; the whole prote&s;tant chri&s;tian church, con&s;idering them as a body, or a nation, or a com|munity, as they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from heathens, to whom the oracles of God are not committed, and as they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from anti-chri&s;t; as they unite in naming Chri&s;t's name, and profe&s;&s;ing his religion: This I under&s;tand to be the Jeru&s;alem that we are to wi&s;h peace to or in. I might add, that this people hath both civil and religious pri|vileges to be committed to the divine care: And by Jeru&s;alem, we may under&s;tand God's people in their civil and religious capacities.</P>
<P>But I proceed as was propo&s;ed, in the &s;econd place, to &s;hew what we are to under&s;tand by the peace wi&s;hed, de&s;ired, or prayed for to or in Je|ru&s;alem. And peace here may be under&s;tood as including temporal pro&s;perity in general. It is indeed comprehen&s;ive of all pro&s;perity: So David &s;eems to under&s;tand peace here, the praying for the peace of Jeru&s;alem recommended in the con|text, he con&s;iders as an expre&s;&s;ion of love to her, and he &s;ays, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Peace be within thy walls, and pro&s;perity within thy palaces; and in the text, and ver&s;e following, he &s;ays, Peace be within thee; and I will &s;eek thy good: So that here pro&s;perity in general was what he de&s;ired: And we find peace, in the idiom of &s;cripture, comprehending under it all manner of &s;afety, welfare and pro&s;peri|ty that can be de&s;ired: It is &s;aid Deut. 24. 6. Thou &s;halt not &s;eek their peace, nor their pro&s;|perity forever;&mdash;where peace and pro&s;perity in|tend the &s;ame thing; and we read that the Lord will &s;peak peace to his people, i. e. he will &s;peak them a ble&s;&s;ing: So Chri&s;t &s;aid to his di&s;ciples,&mdash;Peace be with you; which was a word of ble&s;&s;ing in general: To wi&s;h peace to Jeru&s;alem then, is
<PB N="7" REF="012545_0006_0F8ADBC2594FB4B0">
to wi&s;h her pro&s;perity in every re&s;pect: Peace in oppo&s;ition to calamitous judgments, to di&s;tre&s;&s;es and perplexities. God's own people, as well as others, are liable to &s;ickne&s;&s;es, famines, and the common calamities of life; and, by the&s;e, that peace and quiet of Jeru&s;alem has &s;ometimes been much di&s;turbed: The&s;e are tokens of divine anger, and as &s;uch ought to be deprecated: When the pious inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem hear God threatening the&s;e judgments at any time, they are afraid, and will cry to Him to &s;pare his people; yet as for our&s;elves, &s;o for Jeru&s;alem, with re&s;pect to the outward di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the wi&s;dom and &s;overeignty of the &s;upreme ruler. This peace has various branches; the health of the people is one&mdash;their plenty ano|ther&mdash;their fences in the various branches of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, &amp;c.&mdash;For the&s;e we are to watch and pray&mdash;as al&s;o, for pro&s;perity in all matters of civil govern|ment, that, in all difficult affairs, the Lord would direct and bring about a peaceful time; and however light any may make of this temporal pro&s;perity, yet they are good things, and &s;uch as God knows we need, and as he has promi&s;ed to his people that walk in his ways.</P>
<P>Again,&mdash;By the peace to be wi&s;hed for in Je|ru&s;alem, may be meant their unity in oppo&s;ition to here&s;ies and divi&s;ions. The men of Jeru&s;alem do not always think and &s;peak the &s;ame things; they are not at all times of one accord, of one mind: The vi&s;ible church has often been rent with divi&s;ions, and its peace &s;poiled with here&s;ies: for if the truths of religion be denied, the true citizens of Zion will think them&s;elves obliged to contend for the truth.&mdash;Tho&s;e, who have mi&s;taken appre|hen&s;ions of the truths of religion, are commonly
<PB N="8" REF="012545_0007_0F8ADBC34FEDE950">
as &s;ollicitous to &s;upport their peculiar tenets, as hypocrites are to appear to be real chri&s;tians; and though to contend for the truth is preferable to giving it up, yet religious controver&s;ies are u&s;ual|ly productive of pernicious con&s;equences to the church: So that it is greatly to be de&s;ired by all the friends of Zion's pro&s;perity, that profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians &s;hould unitedly receive, hold fa&s;t and maintain the truth as it is in Je&s;us.&mdash;How de&s;ira|ble the &s;ight, to &s;ee the citizens of Zion united in thought and affection, all true friends, to true re|ligion! It is enjoined on chri&s;tians, to behave as members of the &s;ame body, united to the &s;ame head, and having the &s;ame common intere&s;t; and they are warned again&s;t &s;chi&s;ms and divi&s;ions; &s;o that all well-wi&s;hers to Jeru&s;alem's welfare mu&s;t be afflicted, in a degree, when chri&s;tians contend: And on the contrary, rejoice when their peace is great;&mdash;their unity&mdash;their &s;trength and beauty.</P>
<P>Again,&mdash;By the peace of Jeru&s;alem here may be intended, the promotion of her religious in|tere&s;ts, in oppo&s;ition to infidelity and wickedne&s;s.&mdash;Jeru&s;alem's pro&s;perity doubtle&s;s includes pro&s;perity on religious accounts: This is the main thing for which its pious inhabitants are more &s;ol|licitous for her peace, than for the peace of other nations. When infidelity, vice and wickedne&s;s prevail in a nation: when the labourers in the Lord's vineyard &s;pend their &s;trength for nought, and in vain; how gloomy the pro&s;pect of peace! In this ca&s;e rivers of water will run down the eyes of Zion's friends. Tho&s;e of this character cannot be ea&s;y to &s;ee &s;inners hardening their hearts, and going on in &s;in under the enjoyment of the means of grace: They cannot indeed but wi&s;h to have the whole earth filled with the knowledge and glo|ry
<PB N="9" REF="012545_0008_0F8ADBC38D6EFED0">
of the Lord, and to have Jeru&s;alem a prai&s;e in the earth. The &s;aints are the excellent in the earth: In their eyes vile per&s;ons are contemned: They therefore mu&s;t needs rejoice to &s;ee men walking in the truth, and will accordingly exert them&s;elves for this pro&s;perity of Jeru&s;alem.&mdash;When infidelity &amp; profanene&s;s and all wickedne&s;s prevails, they look upon it as fore boding Jeru&s;a|lem's adver&s;ity, and will accordingly weep before God in the language of the prophet, &s;aying (each one) O Lord I have heard thy &s;peech and was a|fraid: O Lord revive thy work in the mid&s;t of the years, in the mid&s;t of the years make known, in wrath remember mercy.</P>
<P>Again,&mdash;The peace of Jeru&s;alem may be un|der&s;tood as including rejoicing in the Lord, in oppo&s;ition to mourning.&mdash;Jeru&s;alem has her days of adver&s;ity; there are times when her inha|bitants &s;ee not tho&s;e tokens of the divine pre&s;ence, which they have been wont to &s;ee: in&s;tead of rejoiceing in God, their language is that of David, "How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord forever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?" The church, in&s;tead of the garment of prai&s;e, have &s;ometimes the &s;pirit of heavine&s;s: But even then, it is encouraging to think, that there is a time appointed in infinite wi&s;dom, to which eternal truth has fixed her deliverance: God him&s;elf will ari&s;e and have mercy upon her, in contempt of all the oppo&s;ition made by her e|nemies: The zeal of the Lord of ho&s;ts &s;hall do this as the p&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;es it, "For this, God will appear in &s;uch a glory as kings them&s;elves &s;hall &s;tand in awe of:" All that are cordially de&s;irous of Zion's pro&s;perity will weep with them that
<PB N="10" REF="012545_0009_0F8ADBC443317D58">
weep; they have a tender &s;ympathy &amp; fellow-feeling with tho&s;e that are in trouble, and will cry to the Lord to turn his people, and cau&s;e his face to &s;hine upon them; will re&s;olve with the prophet, for Zion's &s;ake, not to hold their peace, and for Jeru&s;a|lem's &s;ake not to re&s;t, until the righteou&s;ne&s;s there|of go forth as brightne&s;s, and the &s;alvation there|of as a lamp that burneth.</P>
<P>I proceed to ob&s;erve, that Jeru&s;alem's peace certainly intends peace in the mo&s;t common ac|ceptation of the word, i. e. in oppo&s;ition to wars.&mdash;Jeru&s;alem, God's own covenant people, are lia|ble to the calamities of war here in this evil world; &s;he hath enemies that would &s;wallow her up, if the Lord were not her refuge, &s;trength and &s;hield: As Jeru&s;alem of old was &s;orely cha&s;tened, and once laid wa&s;te by enemies; &s;o the chri&s;tian prote&s;tant church has been al&s;o &s;orely cha&s;tened by men her enemies; and they are not all de|&s;troyed: We may not therefore conclude, that we &s;hall never again be engaged in war. The French are found to be among&s;t the inveterate anti-chri&s;|tian enemies to the Engli&s;h nation: The&s;e, both by intere&s;t, and the prejudices of their religion, are &s;et again&s;t us; and &s;hould war break out among&s;t the nations, (which may be &s;ooner than we ex|pect) we may depend upon it, that &s;uch our ene|mies will appear, as will exert them&s;elves for our de&s;truction.&mdash;Thrones and dominions, principali|ties and powers are &s;ubject to Him, who&s;e do|minion ruleth over all: As by Him kings reign, &s;o he cuts in &s;under the &s;pirits of princes, &s;catters their coun&s;els, and di&s;appoints their wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures, &s;uch as are the mo&s;t peaceable and prudent: So that how good &s;oever our pro&s;pect of peace may be, through the wi&s;e and prudent coun&s;els of the
<PB N="11" REF="012545_0010_0F8ADBC50484E410">
guardians of our Jeru&s;alem: Yet what changes may be in the right Hand of the Mo&s;t High, concerning us, in this re&s;pect, who is able to &s;ay? All endeavors for the pre&s;ervation of peace in Je|ru&s;alem may be di&s;appointed; and we may be ob|liged to hear the found of the trumpet; the a|larm of war. War is a calamity, by which God &s;ometimes puni&s;hes his people for their &s;ins; and when we reflect upon and con&s;ider the many &s;ins prevailing in our Jeru&s;alem, the impudence many of its inhabitants are grown up to in &s;in; the in|gratitude and decay of religion, that is pure and undefiled before God; when we con&s;ider how lit|tle of a &s;pirit of repentance and reformation is to be &s;een, after the many repeated threatnings and warnings from God in his word, and from the watchmen of his Jeru&s;alem, and by his judgments; What can we rea&s;onably expect, but to be judged for tho&s;e things, and puni&s;hed, either by the &s;word of the enemy, or &s;ome other Judgment? Are we not too nearly in the condition of tho&s;e &s;upine re|gardle&s;s people, of which we read in the I&s;t of Zephaniah, concerning which the prophet &s;ays, "It &s;hall come to pa&s;s at that day, that I will &s;earch Jeru&s;alem with candles, and puni&s;h the men that are &s;ettled upon their lees; that &s;ay in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil." And if &s;o, why &s;hould we not ex|pect to be doomed as they were? Therefore of them it is &s;aid, Their goods &s;hall become a boo|ty, and their hou&s;es a de&s;olation; their blood &s;hall be poured out as du&s;t and their fle&s;h as the dung; neither their &s;ilver nor their gold &s;hall be able to deliver them. However in &s;ome propor|tion to the pro&s;pect of war, all the friends of Zion, all the pious inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, will be &s;ol|licitous
<PB N="12" REF="012545_0011_0F8ADBC5FAC8D400">
for the continuance of the ble&s;&s;ing of peace; unle&s;s circum&s;tances &s;hould ari&s;e, in which it &s;hould appear nece&s;&s;ary to engage in war, for the greater good of the whole. Our enemies may wrongfully invade us; and their inju&s;tice may be &s;o great, that unle&s;s a public war be un|dertaken, (which by the way is al&s;o to be mana|ged by the authority of the community) neither our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions nor any thing dear to us in the world, our lives, will be far from being &s;ecure: And by thus attempting the ob&s;truction of &s;uch our enemies, it may be, that we may not only &s;e|cure our&s;elves, but others al&s;o, who otherwi&s;e, might be afterwards de&s;troyed by them. Our natures are &s;o con&s;tituted, that we cannot but approve of kind and benevolent actions; and ab|hor tho&s;e that are malevolent and cruel: And it is accordingly unnatural, to begin to hurt unpro|voked; and con&s;equently the numerous calami|ties of which war is productive to mankind, vir|tue mu&s;t require the authority of a community, not to entertain a thought of encrea&s;ing their do|minions, &amp;c. at the expence of the innocent. Neverthele&s;s &s;elf-defence may require the u&s;e of warlike weapons, or taking up arms to prevent an incur&s;ion evidently intended, and the effu&s;ion of human blood, which would be the probable con|&s;equence of it. But now can this be done with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s, without well di&s;ciplined troops? David, who well knew the &s;afety of making God his tru&s;t, and that this was his principal defence; we accordingly find praying to him for all kinds of pro&s;perity in Jeru&s;alem; yet we al&s;o find him ble&s;&s;ing God, who had taught his hands to war, and his fingers to fight: As he was de&s;igned for I&s;rael's champi|on, he mu&s;t be a &s;oldier, mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with
<PB N="13" REF="012545_0012_0F8ADBC681F8A380">
military &s;kill. Valiant &s;oldiers are, under God, the &s;ecurity and fafety of his people; upon the&s;e, peace and the comforts of it very much depend: For the&s;e awe, and guard again&s;t, encroaching ene|mies; or are a defence again&s;t tho&s;e that invade and would &s;poil her.&mdash;David's reign produced many bold and brave men, which he took care to have well &s;killed in all the arts of it, and to the&s;e (under God) his numerous victories were very much owing; yet he had re&s;pect to eminent val|our and military &s;kill, appears by his appointment of Joab to be his chief captain and general of the forces of Judah, and afterwards captain-general of all the forces of I&s;rael and Judah; as al&s;o in his preferring brave men, men of war, and fit for the battle, as we find he did, men that had been di&s;ci|plined, trained up to military exerci&s;es, that could handle &s;hield and buckler, that could u&s;e both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive weapons: And indeed we are taught the nece&s;&s;ity of expert and valiant &s;oldiers by our own experience &amp; rea&s;on: To the&s;e, under God, are owing our lives, our religion and the liberty we enjoy. Had it not been for the valiant and martial atchievements of tho&s;e of our ance&s;tors, who had &s;kill in the art of war, our fore|fathers would have been extirpated by the nume|rous tribes of Indians which &s;o frequently attempt|ed their de&s;truction. To the&s;e, under God, the fre|quent calls to rejoicing in conque&s;ts, that have &s;ince been made, are very much owing. To what el&s;e can it be owing, that the names of <HI>Pepperell, Wol&s;e</HI> and <HI>Amher&s;t,</HI> and others that might be mentioned, carry in them &s;o joyful a &s;ound, but becau&s;e they were brave, faithful, and virtuous officers? Rea&s;on teaches the nece&s;&s;ity of expert and valiant &s;oldiers, that they may be able (when
<PB N="14" REF="012545_0013_0F8ADBCAE309A290">
called) to play the men, for the public &s;afety and welfare: Without this, our Jeru&s;alem might be a very ea&s;y prey to our enemies, if they were few, compared with what they are. However, there is (as one well expre&s;&s;es it) &s;o much true manli|ne&s;s and grandeur in military exerci&s;e: It in&s;pires the mind with &s;uch ju&s;t, honorable and exalted notions and di&s;po&s;itions: It &s;o much tends to bani&s;h a littlene&s;s and meanne&s;s, and fill men with greatne&s;s of &s;pirit, (for a truly valiant &s;oldier would di&s;dain to kill even his enemy, in a little under|hand and &s;neaking manner) that every per&s;on that has any reli&s;h for what is ju&s;t, manly and honora|ble, would labour to maintain it for the good of mankind. And we find it ob&s;erved of the old Romans, that as a martial &s;pirit decayed among them, in proportion luxury prevailed; and con|&s;equently effeminacy and a train of vices over|&s;pread them; which as it &s;unk their population, &s;o by degrees ended in the ruin of their country. And it is &s;aid to be found true in general, that where a generous and military &s;pirit &s;inks and de|cays, luxury and wickedne&s;s, that brings a people low, overflows as a flood, even again&s;t the re|&s;traints, and under all the advantages of religion. Religion certainly was never de&s;igned to counte|nance the lea&s;t preten&s;ion to taking away from men, or depriving them of, the nece&s;&s;ary or pru|dent means of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and &s;elf defence, or &s;afety of their families or country: And tho' Solomon, that wi&s;e&s;t of men, had &s;aid, that wi&s;dom is better than weapons of war; he could not mean to di&s;countenance a &s;killful and prudent management of them. It is true he reigned in a peaceable time, and was honoured; for God made all quiet round about him, that he might build an

hou&s;e in his name, and prepare his &s;anctuary for|ever (as the author of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus expre&s;&s;es it) yet he knew that his father was a man of war; who, when he found that God had refu&s;ed him the privilege of building him a temple, and had re|&s;erved the work for his &s;on, encouraged his mili|tary officers and &s;oldiers; and fought with and &s;ubdued his enemies on every &s;ide; that when his &s;on &s;hould come to undertake that great affair, he might meet with as little mole&s;tation as po&s;&s;ible: He well knew, how that, when the u&s;e of the bow had for &s;ome time been neglected by the children of Judah in &s;ome mea&s;ure, his father nobly ex|horted them to return more generally to the u&s;e of it, to exerci&s;e them&s;elves in that weapon (then a principal one) whereby he had di&s;covered his concern for the armies of I&s;rael; and &s;o left him an example: And indeed an example to the prin|cipal military officers in all &s;ucceeding ages, to countenance and encourage the u&s;e of arms, and art of war. And we find that Saul and Jonathan are in the &s;criptures termed the beauty of I&s;rael; their flower and glory, principally on account of their military &s;kill and bravery in war. We al&s;o there find many grand and di&s;tingui&s;hing charac|ters given to men on the &s;ame account: What a name did Abraham, the father of the faithful, gain to him&s;elf by his victorious overthrow of the four kings; and that with the trained &s;oldiers of his own hou&s;e? But it would be too tedious to at|tempt at this time to give you the particular cha|racters of Gideon, Jephtha &amp; Samp&s;on, of Jo&s;hua and the judges, of Jeho&s;haphat, A&s;a, Hezekiah, &amp;c, &s;o renowned for their military &s;kill and war-like actions. Moreover&mdash;The art becoming a &s;oldier, we find mentioned al&s;o in the New Te&s;tament&punc;
<PB N="16" REF="012545_0015_0F8ADBCC2289BC60">
John the bapti&s;t does not condemn, but regulate, the office and employment of &s;oldiers; when they de&s;ired to receive the word of command from him, he does not advi&s;e them to ca&s;t away their arms, abandon war, and &s;o appear no more as mi|litary men in the field; which he would have done without doubt, had their office and employment been unavoidably &s;inful: In&s;tead of that, he only advi&s;es them to manage their employment inoffen|&s;ively. And we find our Saviour Him&s;elf mind|ing his di&s;ciples to expect, that their enemies would be more fierce upon them, than they had been: And accordingly he gives warning, that he among&s;t them, that had no &s;word, wherewith to defend Him&s;elf, might find great want of one, and might therefore be ready to wi&s;h, &s;ome time or other, that he had &s;old his garment and bought one.&mdash;After all, we find peace among the ble&s;&s;ings, that God has promi&s;ed to his church in the latter days: It is &s;aid, that in the la&s;t days it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that the mountain of the hou&s;e of the Lord &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the top of the mountains, and it &s;hall be exalted above the hills, and people &s;hall flow unto it, and many nations &s;hall come and &s;ay, come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the hou&s;e of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for the law &s;hall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeru&s;alem; and he &s;hall judge among many people, and rebuke &s;trong nations afar off; and they &s;hall beat their &s;words into plow-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks: Nation &s;hall not lift up a &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more: But they &s;hall &s;it every man under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and none &s;hall make them

afraid; (&s;ays the prophet) for the mouth of the Lord of Ho&s;ts hath &s;poken it. Such as are now hateful, hating one another, will then have hearts glowing with love to God; and this principle of love will produce univer&s;al harmony and peace: Surely &s;uch a change as this in this corrupt apo&s;tate world mu&s;t needs be de&s;irable. It is a delightful thought, that the prayers of the &s;aints in all ages, for the pro&s;perity of Zion, &s;hall be an&s;wered; and the glorious things &s;poken of her in the &s;acred oracles fully accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to &s;ome improvement of what has now been offer'd.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t;&mdash;It is evident from what has now been offer'd, that they are unworthy to be citizens of Jeru&s;alem, that don't wi&s;h peace to her. That man is unworthy to partake with God's people in their civil and religious privileges, that is not an hearty friend to them, and who does not really de|&s;ire the wellfare of God's people, with whom he is a &s;harer in tho&s;e privileges: He is of a tem|per very diver&s;e from that expre&s;&s;ed it my text. As the p&s;almi&s;t &s;ays of them that love Zion's pro&s;perity, that they &s;hall pro&s;per; &s;o on the con|trary, they, that do not love her pro&s;perity, are not likely to pro&s;per: Whether they will be marked out for wrath in the pre&s;ent world, or not, is not &s;o ea&s;y for us with certainty to determine: There are however, pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred writ that ex|pre&s;s their liablene&s;s to it; and they are certainly unworthy of a name and place among God's peo|ple; and when the great &s;eperation &s;hall be made of the tares from the wheat, then all the enemies
<PB N="18" REF="012545_0017_0F8ADBCD414397D8">
of Jeru&s;alem will be put away, and &s;hall not par|take of the heavenly inheritance, with them that are hearty friends, and particularly &s;uch to the people of God.</P>
<P>Secondly; we infer that every cordial well-wi&s;her to Jeru&s;alem's wellfare mu&s;t needs be of a public &s;pirit: How general is the di&s;ea&s;e of a &s;elf|i&s;h &s;pirit among mankind? The apo&s;tle Paul ob&s;erving it once &s;aid, all men &s;eek their own, not the things that are Je&s;us Chri&s;t's: How little of real charity is there among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity? how few that will deny them&s;elves for the public good? how few (comparatively) are they, that will exert them&s;elves in all proper ways for Jeru&s;alem's peace? We &s;hould doubtle&s;s do well to con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity of loving Jeru&s;a|lem's pro&s;perity, as we would an&s;wer our charac|ters as chri&s;tians; &amp; that we &s;o love it, as to morti|fy and put away that narrowne&s;s of &s;pirit that is too common among&s;t men. They that will be humour&s;ome, and mu&s;t needs have affairs con|ducted in a manner exactly accomodated to their liking, or they will contend, mu&s;t not be looked upon as cordial friends to the welfare of Jeru&s;a|lem. If we love Jeru&s;alem's pro&s;perity, we mu&s;t de&s;ire to have righteou&s;ne&s;s and the fruits of it a|bound, and mu&s;t our&s;elves aim to be righteous in our dealings, and to do as we would be done un|to: If we love the pro&s;perity of Zion we &s;hall be cordial friends to true religion; and &s;hall not, to favor this or the other party, con&s;ent to turn a&s;ide to vain jangling: Our affections will flow out to all that appear to love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;incerity; and we &s;hall aim to avoid all the &s;tumb|ling blocks, that are the occa&s;ion of others falling,
<PB N="19" REF="012545_0018_0F8ADBCF43CD6B50">
and to do our part towards preparing the way of the Lord, and making his paths &s;traight: Though Zion's friends will hate the error of them that turn a&s;ide from the truth, yet they will not &s;uffer their re&s;entment to carry them into the con|trary error and extream: They will account truth to be for Jeru&s;alem's intere&s;t, and will be proper|ly concerned at all times to be on their watch for Jeru&s;alem's &s;ake.</P>
<P>But thirdly; we infer, that &s;uch as love Jeru&s;a|lem &s;hould countenance and encourage improve|ments in military &s;kill and knowledge. Such on|ly may be &s;aid to love Jeru&s;alem as David did, to whom it is matter of holy rejoicing to go up to the hou&s;e of the Lord, and with his people to wait on Him in the ordinances of it; who hun|ger and thir&s;t after the &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, which of divine grace, are di&s;pen&s;ed there; who &s;incere|ly pray for Jeru&s;alem's peace; who &s;tudy and con&s;cientiou&s;ly pur&s;ue the things, that make for peace, and wherewith one may edify another; who prefer Jeru&s;alem above their chiefe&s;t joy, and by con&s;equence will deny them&s;elves for its pro&s;|perity, who, for their brethren and companions &s;akes, &s;ay, Peace be within thee: For the &s;ake of the hou&s;e of God, we will &s;eek thy good. The&s;e &s;hould countenance and encourage improvements in military &s;kill and knowledge: The&s;e improve|ments ought to be encouraged by the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem in general; and e&s;pecially by her friends. I would not be under&s;tood to mean, that all &s;uch &s;hould labour to be acompli&s;hed &s;oldiers: For it is not &s;uppo&s;ed that they have, all of them, a martial &s;pirit; yet they &s;hould promote and en|courage it in tho&s;e that have it, for the &s;ecurity of Jeru&s;alem: It argues their wi&s;dom to improve
<PB N="20" REF="012545_0019_0F8ADBCF96EC7C08">
all the advantages they have, for &s;ecuring her peace and, privileges; and by &s;uitably encourag|ing a martial &s;pirit, they may get into good cir|cum&s;tances to di&s;pute it with tho&s;e that may wrongfully invade them: They &s;hould know that a thorough acquaintance with military affairs is laudable and nece&s;&s;ary: And that per&s;ons who improve in knowledge of this kind, de&s;erve &s;ingu|lar re&s;pect; and &s;hould by no means be di&s;coun|tenanced by the friends of Jeru&s;alem; who, hav|ing a peculiar tenderne&s;s for her, mu&s;t encourage fighting, as well as praying for her, under given circum&s;tances. How long we may &s;it under our vines and fig-trees, and have none to make us a|fraid, the God of our peace only knows; and &s;hould war break out among the nations, Jeru&s;a|lem's friends might wi&s;h that men of martial &s;pirits and military accompli&s;hments were more nume|rous among its inhabitants.</P>
<P>But fourthly;&mdash;We infer that love to Jeru&s;alem will influence its &s;ubjects of a martial &s;pirit to excell in &s;oldier&s;hip. Men of this character will endeavor, in the u&s;e and pur&s;uit of all proper means and methods, to acquire the knowledge of every part of military &s;kill: Not content with under&s;tanding how to u&s;e war-like weapons; they'll be &s;ollicitous to know how to charge their enemies &s;ucce&s;sfully; how to take the mo&s;t ad|vantageous ground; how to advance: and to make a regular and advantageous retreat; how to defend them&s;elves by entrenchments; what &s;tratagems to make up; how to pur&s;ue a victory when obtained, &amp;c, that they may be abundant|ly qualified to fight for the &s;ecurity and in the de|fence of Jeru&s;alem: And after all they will depend
<PB N="21" REF="012545_0020_0F8ADBD139340EE8">
on that God, that taught David's hands to war, and fingers to fight; who determines the event of war in favor of every &s;ide, as he plea&s;es; with whom its nothing to help, whether with many or with tho&s;e that have power. Tho&s;e of this cha|racter will march forth at God's providential call, and in his &s;trength, in defence of the civil and re|ligious privileges of his people, and may rea&s;ona|bly expect to vanqui&s;h their enemies: They are of the called and cho&s;en and faithful, that will follow the Lamb whither&s;oever he leads them: They'll not fear the faces of the enemies of God's people in a righteous cau&s;e; but, having the true &s;pirit, and courage, and re&s;olution of &s;oldiers, will be above cowardi&s;e: And, being in &s;uch a &s;tate, and of &s;uch a temper of mind, as to expect the change to be made in them by death will be ad|vantageous to them: They'll fear neither guns, nor &s;words, nor any other in&s;truments of death, when properly call'd to engage.</P>
<P>In the fifth place;&mdash;What has been offered on this &s;ubject may be applied by way of addre&s;s to you, GENTLEMEN of the ARTILLERY COMPANY; at who&s;e reque&s;t I now appear in this de&s;k. Gen|tlemen, you cannot be in&s;en&s;ible of it, that I&s;rael's champion was an eminent friend to Jeru&s;alem, &s;ince it is &s;o evident that he &s;incerely and fervent|ly prayed for her peace; and bravely fought ma|ny battles for her &s;ecurity and in her defence. It is pre&s;umed, that you look upon his example as worthy your imitation; and that you are accord|ingly de&s;irous, that the number of Jeru&s;alem's friends in our day be increa&s;ed; good rulers encou|raged; and that the peace and pro&s;perity of all your brethren and companions in the privileges
<PB N="22" REF="012545_0021_0F8ADBD1CFFF90D8">
and ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy may be promoted; that every token of the divine anger might be remo|ved from her; that her citizens might be united in thought and affection; that religion might re|revive and flouri&s;h abundantly in her; and par|ticularly that enemies might not be permitted to invade her. However, &s;hould circum&s;tances be &s;o planned in providence, in which to engage in war, &s;hould be judged nece&s;&s;ary by public autho|rity; though you approve of kind and benevolent actions, and abhor tho&s;e that are malevolent and cruel; yet we cannot doubt, but you would, be|ing properly called, chearfully exert your&s;elves, and in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible manner, di&s;play your im|provements in the art of war, for the wellfare of God's people, with whom you are partakers in ci|vil and religious privileges truly honorable: It has been, and it mu&s;t be &s;o, or we could not e&s;teem your ancient company, as now we do, really ho|norable. It was for this important purpo&s;e, that your company was &s;o long &s;ince formed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That it might be a nur&s;ery of acompli&s;hed &s;ol|diers, that might, if properly called, do worthily for God and his people. We gratefully acknow|ledge, that many are the advantages, which have accrued to our Jeru&s;alem, from your con&s;titution; and it is rea&s;onably expected, that you be duly attentive to the original de&s;ign of it. Gentlemen, as you are volunteers, it is expected you love the Art Military, and that you are friends to Jeru&s;a|lem. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e that you would otherwi&s;e have been at &s;o great expence of time and money, for your military accompli&s;hments and accoutre|ments; or that otherwi&s;e you would lay out your|&s;elves, as now you do, to encourage others of a martial &s;pirit, to make improvements in military
<PB N="23" REF="012545_0022_0F8ADBD3D4C38958">
&s;kill and knowledge. You de&s;erve &s;ingular re|&s;pect from the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem in gene|ral. You are countenanced by gentlemen of the fir&s;t character in this part of our Jeru&s;alem, and have been for many years on the&s;e occa&s;ions. You now &s;ee your&s;elves countenanced by the pre|&s;ence of the Captain-General and commander in chief, by the pre&s;ence of the Lieutenant-Gover|nor, and by &s;everal others of our mo&s;t re&s;pectable Magi&s;trates. You are countenanced by the ex|amples of grand and di&s;tingui&s;hing characters in the word of God; and by the Lord of Ho&s;ts Him|&s;elf, the &s;upreme Ruler over all; both in the old and new te&s;tament. May the God of armies en|courage your hearts, and teach your fingers to fight in Jeru&s;alem's defence, whenever he may call you, in a military character, to di&s;pute our privileges with our enemies.</P>
<P>To conclude;&mdash;Let us all daily and earne&s;tly plead with God for Jeru&s;alem's wellfare: And may we have grace to do it acceptably; and be|have our&s;elves in all re&s;pects, in a manner corre&s;|pondent to &s;uch a practice, each one doing his part for the promotion of this important event! And let us be importunate for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the mountain of the Lord's hou&s;e on the top of the mountains, for great additions to the church, by the calling in of the Jews and Gentiles. Then may we expect that pro&s;perity (as a hint of divine love and grace) which we really need; &s;piritual and eternal, if not temporal felicity:&mdash;Which God of his infinite mercy grant may be the portion of us all through Je&s;us Chri&s;t: To whom be all honor and glory, dominion and pow|er now and forever, AMEN.</P>
