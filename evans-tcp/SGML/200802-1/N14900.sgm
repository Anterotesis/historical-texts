<HEAD>TO THE HONORABLE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF PENNSYLVANIA IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHETHER the Bank &s;hall be aboli&s;hed or e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, is one of tho&s;e important que&s;tions which will in cour&s;e attract your notice. The heat of di&s;puta|tion will then give birth to many arguments. But di&s;putants do not always convey information. There is (no doubt) a great majority of members who will vote according to their di&s;pa&s;&s;ion|ate judgment; and &s;uch men will naturally wi&s;h to form opini|ons on plain rea&s;on plainly delivered. To them therefore this paper is addre&s;&s;ed. And, in order that we may have a clear view of the object, let us con&s;ider (fir&s;t) whether admitting the in&s;titution of the Bank to have been pernicious, a law to aboli&s;h it would be wi&s;e, and (&s;econdly) whether it is really a pernici|ous in&s;titution.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, admitting the in&s;titution of the Bank to have been pernicious, would a law to aboli&s;h it be wi&s;e. The an&s;wer to this que&s;tion depends on two points. Fir&s;t, whether &s;uch a law would be effectual; and &s;econdly, whether it would be prudent. An enquiry whether the law would be effectual, involves a doubt of your power, and may therefore offend the weak or illiberal, but wi&s;e repre&s;entatives of free citizens, will li&s;ten with candour and form a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate judgment. They know that the boa&s;ted omnipotence of legi&s;lative authority is but a jingle of words. In the literal meaning it is impious. And whatever interpretation lawyers may give, freemen mu&s;t feel it to be ab&s;urd and uncon|&s;titutional. <HI>Ab&s;urd,</HI> becau&s;e laws cannot alter the nature of things; <HI>uncon&s;titutional,</HI> becau&s;e the con&s;titution is no more, if it can be changed by the legi&s;lature. A law was once pa&s;&s;ed in New-Jer&s;ey which the judges pronounced to be uncon&s;titutional, and therefore void, &s;urely no good citizen can wi&s;h to &s;ee this point decided in the tribunals of Penn&s;ylvania. Such power in judges is dangerous; but unle&s;s it &s;ome where exi&s;ts, the time employed in framing a bill of rights and form of government was meerly thrown away.</P>
<P>The doubt which ari&s;es on this occa&s;ion, as to the extent of your authority, is not founded on the charter granted by Con|gre&s;s:
<PB N="4" REF="018897_0003_0FA82B1D52CED1C0">
but &s;uppo&s;ing the incorporation of the Bank to have been the &s;ame in its origin as that of a church, we a&s;k whether the ex|i&s;tence and the rights acquired by law, can be de&s;troyed by law. Negroes have by law acquired the right of citizens, would a &s;ub&s;equent law take that right away? It is not true that the right to give, involves the right to take. A father (for in&s;tance) has no power over the life of his child, nor can a felon or traitor pardoned by act of grace, be by repeal of that act condemned and executed. Should an act be pa&s;&s;ed to cancel the public debts, would that act be valid? Where an e&s;tate has been granted by law, can it be revoked by a &s;ub&s;equent law? Could the lands forfeited and &s;old, be re&s;umed and conveyed to the original own|ers? Many &s;uch que&s;tions might be put, and a judicial deci&s;ion (either affirmative or negative) would be inconvenient and dan|gerous. Look then to the end e'er you commence the labor.</P>
<P>Secondly, admitting your power, ought it (in prudence) to be exerci&s;ed. You will certainly con&s;ider, that (as a violation of private property) it mu&s;t &s;ully the reputation of the &s;tate. Good men are careful of their own reputation, and protect that of their country, from <HI>&s;entiment.</HI> Wi&s;e men are confirmed in this &s;entiment, by <HI>reflection</HI> and <HI>information.</HI> Facts are &s;ometimes bet|ter than arguments. It is then a fact, that applications made by citizens of Penn&s;ylvania to borrow money in Holland, have been defeated by tho&s;e attacks already made on the Bank. It is al&s;o a fact, that the credit of our merchants has been greatly in|jured (in foreign countries) from the &s;ame cau&s;e. This is the argument which foreigners u&s;e. <HI>If your government &s;o little re&s;|pects the property of their own citizens as to overturn an in&s;titution like the Bank, how can our property be &s;afe among you?</HI> It will not be ea&s;y to an&s;wer that que&s;tion, and you know gentlemen that your merchants cannot give credit, unle&s;s they can get credit; and you know al&s;o how important credit is to the frontier inhabitants at lea&s;t, if not to tho&s;e of the more &s;ettled country.</P>
<P>Deeply therefore are we intere&s;ted in pre&s;erving un&s;ullied fame. But if this con&s;ideration has not &s;ufficient weight, re|flect on the dome&s;tic con&s;equences of aboli&s;hing charters. What is practice to-day, becomes precedent to-morrow. And &s;ure it is worth &s;ome &s;erious thought, whether this dangerous practice &s;hall be introduced. Every man is intere&s;ted in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of &s;uch precedent, as a member of &s;ome religious &s;ociety, or of particular corporations for the promotion of &s;cience, or the purpo&s;es of humanity. Attention to the changes of human affairs, like meditation among the tombs, teaches &s;olemn and
<PB N="5" REF="018897_0004_0FA82B1E10044BC8">
affecting le&s;&s;ons of wi&s;dom and moderation. Look back to the di&s;putes which convul&s;ed this commonwealth twenty years ago. Mark the &s;ucceeding revolutions. See how friend&s;hips and how enmities have changed. See how power has been wre&s;ted from one, and gra&s;ped by another. This generation will &s;oon pa&s;s away. Who can de&s;ignate the men that will &s;it in &s;eats of au|thority twenty years hence? or five? or one? You are here to-day, and gone to-morrow. Beware then how you lay the foun|dation for future encroachments. While ju&s;tice is the principle of government, to be innocent is to be &s;ecure. Be not then &s;e|duced by the momentary bauble of power; for place it where you will it is dangerous, and the tyrannous u&s;e of it is always tyranny. Tho&s;e who live by the &s;word &s;hall die by the &s;word. The violent mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, become victims of violence. Should the next election give power to tho&s;e who may now be oppre&s;&s;ed, what bounds &s;hall be &s;et to unbridled re&s;entment? May not all charters be at once laid low, by a general law de|claring the exi&s;tence of corporations to be incompatible with the public welfare? Since, then, the&s;e con&s;equences may fol|low, we may rea&s;onably doubt whether a law to aboli&s;h the Bank would be wi&s;e, even if the in&s;titution had been pernicious. But is it really a pernicious in&s;titution?</P>
<P>This que&s;tion is of great magnitude. Some objections again&s;t the bank may perhaps be well founded. Let us examine them. They are fir&s;t, that it enables men to trade to their utter ruin by giving them the temporary u&s;e of credit and money. Secondly, that the punctuality required at the Bank, throws hone&s;t men into the hands of u&s;urers. Thirdly, that the great dividend on bank &s;tock induces monied men to buy &s;tock rather than lend on intere&s;t. Fourthly, that rich foreigners will (for the &s;ame rea&s;on) become &s;tockholders &s;o as that all the property will fi|nally ve&s;t in them. Fifthly, that the payment of dividends to foreigners will be a con&s;tant drain of &s;pecie from the country. Sixthly, that the Bank facilitates the exportation of coin? Seventh|ly, that it injures the circulation of bills of credit. Eighthly, that the wealth and influence of the Bank may become dange|rous to the government. Ninthly, that the directors can ob|tain unfair advantages in trade for them&s;elves and their friends. And tenthly, that it is de&s;tructive of that equality which ought to take place in a free country.</P>
<P>The&s;e objections, though artfully made and indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated, do not con&s;i&s;t very well together. For if it be true that the Bank enables men to overtrade them&s;elves, by the u&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="018897_0005_0FA82B1EC77AC3B0" MS="y">
of money at an ea&s;y rate; it cannot be true that it throws men into the hands of u&s;urers, who exact for the u&s;e of money an exorbitant rate. If it be true, that foreigners will buy out &s;tockholders (even as is &s;aid at fifty per cent advance) &s;o as to be|come proprietors of the whole; it cannot be true that the money of our rich citizens will be ve&s;ted in bank &s;tock, and none remain for loans. If it be true, that the Bank facilitates the exportation of coin; it cannot be true that it injures the circulation of bills of credit, which bills are always expre&s;sly emitted to &s;upply the real or &s;uppo&s;ed want of &s;pecie. If it be true, that the u&s;e of money obtained by di&s;counts at the Bank ruins the trade; it cannot be true that the directors and their friends would gain any advantage by it. If it be true, that the Bank has a tenden|cy to lock up in its vaults the money of rich citizens; it cannot be true that it facilitates the exportation of coin. If it be true, that foreigners will continually bring in money to buy the prin|cipal of the &s;tock; it cannot be true that the country will conti|nually be drained of &s;pecie by paying the dividend on that prin|cipal. If it be true, that the funds of the Bank mu&s;t finally ve&s;t in foreigners; it cannot be true that it is de&s;tructive of equality among the citizens.</P>
<P>Thus much in general. Let us next con&s;ider each objection by it&s;elf; and fir&s;t, that it enables men to trade to their utter ruin, by giving them the temporary u&s;e of money. It is true that the Bank has given great facility to commercial people, of which &s;ome have made an imprudent u&s;e, by engaging in ra&s;h and ruinous enterprizes. But this abu&s;e of commercial ad|vantages cannot be prevented, otherwi&s;e than by the de&s;tructi|on of commerce it&s;elf, or by confining the trade (as in China) to an exclu&s;ive company. Neither of the&s;e modes would &s;uit the genius and temper of Penn&s;ylvania. We mu&s;t therefore (as in former times) leave the fooli&s;h to &s;uffer the con&s;equence of their folly, and not puni&s;h (for their &s;akes) the &s;ober and di&s;|creet. The convenience merchants derive from being able to obtain money for &s;hort periods, and on ea&s;y terms, is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to them. And it would be a marvellous thing indeed, if the u&s;e of water were prohibited, becau&s;e &s;ome people chu&s;e to drown them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is &s;aid that the punctuality required at the Bank throws hone&s;t men into the hands of u&s;urers. This objection will admit of nearly the &s;ame an&s;wer with the la&s;t. If men who borrow for a &s;hort term, will engage the funds borrowed in long &s;peculations, thereby depriving them&s;elves of the means of
<PB N="7" REF="018897_0006_0FA82B1F9EDEA238">
payment, who is to blame? Is it the benevolent lender, or the fooli&s;h and di&s;hone&s;t borrower? Why did he incur the debt and undertake the payment? or why dive&s;t him&s;elf of the means? But &s;ay, that a man is (by misfortune) in want of a con&s;ider|able &s;um, without which his credit would &s;uffer. The Bank advance the &s;um for forty days, and &s;ave him from ruin. If within that period he collects his funds, and repays the advance, has he derived no benefit from the Bank? If at the end of forty days he &s;hould be unable to pay, is the &s;ituation wor&s;e than it was? If in that ca&s;e the Bank renew the di&s;count for forty days more, (which has u&s;ually been done) is not the benefit increa&s;|ed? And if after all (when they will tru&s;t him no longer) he apply to u&s;urers, (which he mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have done in the fir&s;t in&s;tance) is the Bank to blame? But the man it &s;eems has been unfortunate, and is ruined, which ruin the Bank did de|lay, but could not prevent. Now what is the conclu&s;ion drawn from the&s;e premi&s;es, and how is it drawn? Why thus. Mis|fortune is the cau&s;e of lo&s;s. Imprudence is the &s;ource of di&s;ap|pointment. Lo&s;s and di&s;appointment demand &s;upplies of ca&s;h. U&s;urers exact enormous intere&s;t. Bad voyages, wild &s;pecula|tions, mi&s;management, and u&s;urious intere&s;t, produce ruin. Therefore the Bank mu&s;t be de&s;troyed. It mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, becau&s;e it would not continue to tru&s;t men who were no longer tru&s;t worthy. Before this objection be repeated, let the&s;e men, or at lea&s;t one of them, be openly named; &s;o that the direc|tors may have an opportunity fairly to combat the charge: and then, if they do not &s;how that the party received every indul|gence he had any right to claim, expect, or even hope for, let the charge be e&s;tabli&s;hed. But until this opportunity be given, <HI>let not the voice of &s;lander be heard in the &s;anctuaries of legi&s;lation.</HI></P>
<P>Rely on it, Gentlemen, that however calumny may ca&s;t the a&s;per&s;ion, no proof will ever be adduced. It might therefore be abandoned to the merited contempt. But &s;ince &s;uch pains have been taken to inculcate a fal&s;e idea that the Bank promotes u&s;ury, let us recur to facts. Before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Bank, u&s;ury had been carried to an alarming degree. Men of the greate&s;t property, who happened to be here from the neigh|bouring &s;tates, were forced to pay as high as ten per cent. for one month's anticipation of their remittances; merchants who met with misfortune were driven to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and the public could not obtain advances upon any terms. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the Bank was in&s;tituted; and there are many in this city and el&s;ewhere whom it &s;aved from de&s;truction.
<PB N="8" REF="018897_0007_0FA82B206ED691F0">
The number of u&s;urers and the rate of u&s;ury, were &s;oon dimi|ni&s;hed. But as there &s;till remained &s;ome objects who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es the Bank could not relieve, <HI>becau&s;e mo&s;t of its funds were employed in the public &s;ervice,</HI> &s;o there &s;till remained &s;ome u&s;urers to prey on tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es. In proportion as the number who want money is increa&s;ed, or (which comes to the &s;ame thing) as the means of obtaining money are dimini&s;hed, in the &s;ame propor|tion will u&s;ury abound and flouri&s;h. This the u&s;urious know, and therefore they have never intermitted their efforts to de&s;troy the Bank, as the &s;ure means of increa&s;ing and &s;ecuring their un|righteous gains. Beware then, Gentlemen, that ye be not dupes to the artifice of &s;uch wretches. It is indeed but a &s;len|der and de&s;picable artifice. A poor attempt to per&s;uade you, that an in&s;titution which lends for one half per cent. per month, drives folks to borrow at ten per cent. And on this ground they &s;ugge&s;t, that the be&s;t mode of preventing men from giving ten per cent. for a month's u&s;e of money, is to di&s;able them from obtaining it on any other terms.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It is &s;aid the dividend on bank &s;tock induces monied men to buy it rather than lend on intere&s;t. The object of this a&s;&s;ertion is to per&s;uade you, that the difficulty of borrowing money ari&s;es meerly or chiefly from the Bank; which is not true. For fir&s;t, it is notorious that few &s;tock holders are of that cla&s;s who were in the habit of lending on intere&s;t. Such as are fo|reigners or inhabitants of the neighbouring States (and the&s;e it is &s;aid own half the &s;tock) would not lend their money in Penn|&s;ylvania, even if circum&s;tances favoured &s;uch loans. A con&s;i|derable part of the remaining half belongs to &s;mall &s;tock hold|ers, who would not &s;end their money into the country. And a far more con&s;iderable part is the property of merchants, who would be obliged immediately to employ their funds in their own bu&s;ine&s;s, if deprived of tho&s;e facilities which the Bank affords. After making the&s;e deductions from the capital of the Bank, the remainder (belonging to tho&s;e who would and could lend) will be incon&s;iderable. But &s;uch as it is, to whom would it be lent? Not to farmers who pay intere&s;t irregularly, and from whom the principal cannot always be recovered without legal proce&s;s. No, it would be lent to merchants, and the greater part to &s;uch as (through nece&s;&s;ity) give more than legal intere&s;t. Can it be be|lieved, while u&s;urers get ten per cent. per month for the u&s;e of money, and pledges in hand for &s;ecurity, that the twenty or thirty thou&s;and dollars (now ve&s;ted in bank &s;tock) which belong to men not engaged in active bu&s;ine&s;s, would be lent on bonds
<PB N="9" REF="018897_0008_0FA82B211309C398">
and mortgages for &s;ix per cent per annum? It is true that money cannot be borrowed, and it is al&s;o true that the purcha&s;e of bank &s;tock is more profitable than lending on intere&s;t. But trace the evils complained of to their true &s;ources, and it will be found that they flow from that u&s;ury which has been occa&s;ioned by the pe|culiar circum&s;tances of the times, and from that oppo&s;ition which has been excited again&s;t the Bank. Why is money &s;carce and not to be borrowed? Why is it &s;o de&s;irable to own bank &s;tock? An an&s;wer to the&s;e two que&s;tions will lead to the &s;olution of a third. How is money to be made more plenty, and to be ob|tained with more ea&s;e?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, why is money &s;carce and not to be borrowed. It is a melancholy truth, that during the late war many were ruin|ed by payment of their debts in paper greatly depreciated. Some who received the paper while it was valuable, put it in the loan office. Some purcha&s;ed land. And &s;ome kept it till it was good for nothing. It is evident, that the&s;e per&s;ons (who before the war were lenders of money) have no money to lend now; and that every &s;hilling &s;o paid and di&s;po&s;ed of, mu&s;t be deducted from the &s;um formerly at intere&s;t in Penn&s;ylvania. The remain|der of that &s;um, is &s;till in the hands of tho&s;e who borrowed it ten years ago, and cannot be lent before it be paid. It may perhaps be &s;aid, that &s;ome merchants made money during the war. But it will be found that the gainers were few, the lo&s;ers numerous; and that taking the merchants collectively as a body, it is poorer by millions. The rea&s;on therefore why money is not to be bor|rowed is that no one has money to lend, and even admitting that there &s;hould be a few who <HI>can</HI> lend, there are none who <HI>will</HI>; for the following rea&s;ons: Tho&s;e who want are always willing to borrow, but tho&s;e who owe are not always willing to pay. If therefore the laws of a country, or the admini&s;tration of tho&s;e laws, countenance unrea&s;onable delays of payment, the owners of money (or any thing el&s;e) will not di&s;po&s;e of their pro|perty on credit, unle&s;s they be tempted by great intere&s;t, or great profit. And &s;uch as di&s;dain u&s;urious dealing, will not be tempted at all. A prudent peaceable man would rather buy &s;tock in the Briti&s;h funds, and receive regularly but five per cent, than take a mortgage at &s;ix, on the be&s;t e&s;tate in Penn&s;yl|vania. Becau&s;e he may &s;uffer for years, a detention of both in|tere&s;t and principal, and becau&s;e he apprehends &s;ome things which have happened already, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd may therefore happen again &mdash;For in&s;tance, he trembles le&s;t a long train of paper emi&s;&s;ions, with a legal tender at the tail of them, &s;hould cancel his debt for a tenth of the value. He fears al&s;o, that a tax on his bond may
<PB N="10" REF="018897_0009_0FA82B21F7586948">
reduce the precarious intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent to four, and even oblige him to pay the two per cent tax, though he cannot re|cover the &s;ix per cent intere&s;t. Thus we find, on fair inve&s;tiga|tion, that money is &s;carce, becau&s;e (in one way or other) it has been taken or withheld from the owners. And that money is not to be borrowed, from a well grounded apprehen&s;ion that (when due) it will not be repaid.</P>
<P>Let us then, in the &s;econd place, enquire why it is &s;o de&s;irable to own bank &s;tock. Three cau&s;es pre&s;ent them&s;elves. Fir&s;t, that the dividend gives &s;omething more than legal intere&s;t, al|though by exten&s;ion of the capital, and contraction of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, it yields le&s;s than formerly. Secondly, that this dividend is payable with rigid punctuality at the end of every half year, &s;o that the proprietors can count with certainty on their income, to defray their expences. Thirdly, that in ca&s;e of unfore&s;een de|mands, the &s;tockholder can (for legal intere&s;t) command a tem|porary accommodation; and if unfortunate events &s;hould oblige him to collect all his re&s;ources, he can &s;peedily &s;ell and there|by command the value of the &s;tock. To the&s;e three rea&s;ons, which &s;trike every per&s;on at fir&s;t &s;ight, mu&s;t be added a fourth as applying more directly to the charge, that the benefits of bank &s;tock incline men to purcha&s;e it rather than lend. After the peace, when the advantages of the Bank had been felt, and the property of &s;tock had become &s;ecure, an oppo&s;ition was rai&s;ed by &s;ome of the &s;ame per&s;ons who are now the oppo&s;ers, but on ground &s;omewhat different. For then, in&s;tead of con&s;i|dering a Bank as pernicious, it was declared to be &s;o highly be|neficial that they mu&s;t needs have two. They did indeed com|plain of the old Bank. But for what? Not becau&s;e the capital was &s;o large as to threaten general ruin, but becau&s;e the directors would not open a &s;ub&s;cription to make it larger. And what was the mode&s;t reque&s;t of that day? Why truly &s;uch an exten&s;ion of the capital, as might enable tho&s;e who had waited for events in perfect ea&s;e and &s;afety, to enjoy the &s;ame advantages with tho&s;e who had borne the burthen, and ran the ri&s;que of the conte&s;t. It was indeed a hard ca&s;e, that many worthy gentlemen who would not have given a &s;hilling to &s;ave the &s;tate, &s;hould be o|bliged either to pay five hundred dollars for a &s;hare in bank which had co&s;t but four, or to lend their money on bond and mortgage to the farmers of Penn&s;ylvania. A very hard ca&s;e! And &s;o loud|ly did they complain of it, that at la&s;t many &s;en&s;ible members of A&s;&s;embly were prevailed on to believe it would be a good thing to have two Banks. Two &s;hops to go to; for that was the fa&s;hion|able

phra&s;e. And they were the more ea&s;ily led into this opinion, becau&s;e it was laid down by &s;ome in high &s;tation for who&s;e &s;en|timents they had acquired an habitual re&s;pect. But that re&s;pect may perhaps be dimini&s;hed, if tho&s;e who pronounced deci&s;ive judgment two years ago that two Banks were nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould now as po&s;itively <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">onounce that no Bank at all is nece&s;&s;ary; and (wonderful to relate) go cackling round the country, that one Bank is pregnant with ruin to the State. The language of truth is uniform, and the&s;e &s;udden changes of ha&s;ty opinion, &s;hew &s;o great a want of temper and knowledge, that tho&s;e who really mean the public good will quit &s;uch blind guides, and think for them|&s;elves. The con&s;equence of the noi&s;e made at that time mu&s;t be well remembered. The A&s;&s;embly were plagued with long ar|guments on both &s;ides, which might as well have been &s;pared, and then all at once the thing was hu&s;hed up and accommodated. Becau&s;e &s;uch of the promoters of the new Bank as had money, found out that mo&s;t of their new friends had none. Becau&s;e they all found out, that the &s;cheme did not promi&s;e &s;o much either of profit or &s;ecurity as was imagined. And becau&s;e they had not too much confidence in each other, being (like Nebuchadnezzar's image) compo&s;ed of di&s;cordant materials. They agreed, there|fore, to abandon their project, on certain conditions acceded to by the old Bank, one of which was to extend the &s;ub&s;cription; and this it is which has converted all the &s;urplus money of the State into bank &s;tock. For otherwi&s;e, let the price of a &s;hare have ri&s;en ever &s;o high, nay had it gone to four thou&s;and in&s;tead of four hundred dollars; not one penny would have been added to the bank capital. But in proportion as &s;tock ro&s;e, the divi|dend would have been le&s;s valuable, till at length it would have been more profitable to lend at &s;ix per cent, than to purcha&s;e bank &s;tock. For in&s;tance, if the dividend on a &s;hare of four hundred dollars had continued to be forty dollars, and the price of &s;uch a &s;hare had ri&s;en to be eight hundred dollars, then the purcha&s;er would have got only five per cent for his money, in&s;tead of &s;ix.</P>
<P>Thirdly, then, let us inquire how money may be rendered more plenty and ea&s;ier to be obtained. And fir&s;t, the &s;ure&s;t way to render money plenty is to bear the evils of &s;carcity. To make it plenty (according to the desire of &s;ome) would be, as in the continental times, to make it no money at all. For when it can be obtained without labor, and found without &s;earch, it is of no u&s;e to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Tho&s;e nice politicians, therefore, who try to make money &s;o plenty that people may get it for nothing, will find that their money is good for no|thing.
<PB N="12" REF="018897_0011_0FA82B24F25B1530">
The &s;carcity con&s;titutes the value. And when that &s;carcity is &s;uch that men will do a great deal for a little, it will become plenty; for tho&s;e will always have mo&s;t money, who will give mo&s;t for it. The complaint that money is &s;carce, is generally made by the idle or the unfortunate; by tho&s;e who will not, or tho&s;e who cannot give any thing in exchange for money, except bare promi&s;es which they cannot or will not perform. Now &s;uch men would &s;uffer more from the want of ca&s;h in Am&s;terdam or London, where it is mo&s;t plenty, than in any part of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania. If folks are idle they mu&s;t be relieved by labor, and if poor by charity. Till this be done, the complaint that money is &s;carce will continue, and though very loud will not be very ju&s;t. There was (for in|&s;tance) a grievous complaint of the want of money at the clo&s;e of the war; and yet every man who had a bu&s;hel of wheat could get eight or nine &s;hillings for it. People in general plunged into extravagance, and laid out their coin for foreign fripperies, and the merchants (unable to remit for payment of the&s;e things in produce, except on ruinous terms) &s;ent away the coin; &s;o that in two years there has been more money exported from this country (in which a &s;carcity was then complained of) than is nece&s;&s;ary for a circulating medium. The &s;everal &s;tates are now i&s;&s;uing paper, that what little &s;pecie is left may al&s;o be exported, in&s;tead of the wheat, corn, rice, tobacco, &amp;c. Flour has long been cheaper in London than in Philadelphia. We buy fine coats, and hand&s;ome buckles, and a thou&s;and other hand|&s;ome fine things in London, and then when called on to pay, though our barns be full of wheat, we will not &s;ell it as former|ly for five &s;hillings the bu&s;hel, but &s;it down and cry becau&s;e money is &s;carce. The waggon is in the mud, and we beg Her|cules to pull it out without putting our own &s;houlders to the wheel. The legi&s;lature mu&s;t relieve us, for we will not relieve our&s;elves. And again&s;t what do we want to be relieved? Why again&s;t our idlene&s;s, extravagance and folly.</P>
<P>But, &s;econdly, another means of making money plenty is to render it le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. For this purpo&s;e enforce the punctual payment of debts, &s;o that tho&s;e who tru&s;t can be &s;ure of reco|vering, in &s;ea&s;on, from tho&s;e whom they have tru&s;ted. This will produce two happy con&s;equences. Fir&s;t, that men will no longer run in debt for idle gewgaws, which they mu&s;t pay for with their &s;ub&s;tance when pay day comes. Executions for debt will then be as whole&s;ome warnings to the extravagant, as ex|ecutions for crimes are to the profligate. Secondly, a man who
<PB N="13" REF="018897_0012_0FA82B2664DC8600">
wants to buy land or needful goods on credit, will then obtain the credit de&s;ired. The punctuality of his payments will ex|tend his credit. Tho&s;e payments will al&s;o enable the merchant to comply with his engagements, which will (in like manner) extend his credit at home and abroad. In proportion to the punctuality of remittances, the merchant will get longer credit, and on better terms; and thus money will be plentier becau&s;e the trading people (who have always a preference in &s;uch things) will be relieved from the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing.</P>
<P>Thirdly, another means of making money plenty, is to enforce a collection of taxes, make &s;olid provi&s;ion for paying the intere&s;t of our debts in coin, and introduce order and oeconomy into the admini&s;tration of affairs. This will re&s;tore the public confi|dence, and then the value of certificates will ri&s;e, and the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors be able to di&s;po&s;e of them for ca&s;h. Thou&s;ands will thereby be relieved who are now in great want of money, and under the dire nece&s;&s;ity of getting it from u&s;urers, or going to gaol.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the&s;e plain and &s;imple mea&s;ures will make money not only plenty but ea&s;y to be obtained. Becau&s;e indu&s;try and fru|gality (which want but little) will thereby be introduced; and we can always command money when we are not in want of it. As to tho&s;e blades who mu&s;t forever want, becau&s;e they &s;pend their time in &s;treets and taverns, and occupy them&s;elves with &s;tate affairs, in&s;tead of their own affairs, and who dre&s;s and fea&s;t and will not work, but wi&s;h to borrow; let them meet the re|buff given by an old philo&s;opher to one of their predece&s;&s;ors.
<Q>Friend borrow of thy back and belly, they will never a&s;k thee for the money, but I &s;hould be very trouble&s;ome.</Q></P>
<P>A fourth objection made again&s;t the Bank is that rich fo|reigners will be induced to become &s;tockholders, &s;o as that all the property will finally ve&s;t in them. This objection has &s;ome weight, and if it be allowed to operate as a bar to mea&s;ures of public utility, will &s;ave a deal of time and trouble to the govern|ment, though it may not conduce to the pro&s;perity of the &s;tate, and mu&s;t prove injurious to tho&s;e by whom it is made. People in general &s;eem now to expect &s;ome permanent provi&s;ion for the intere&s;t of the public debts, and if that &s;hould happen, foreign|ers will purcha&s;e a con&s;iderable &s;hare. The Dutch are &s;aid to hold about thirty millions &s;terling in the Briti&s;h funds, bearing an intere&s;t of four per cent. and they lent five million guilders to Congre&s;s at five per cent. when no funds were provided, and during the war. Hence we may with certainty infer, that they
<PB N="14" REF="018897_0013_0FA82B279AF62920">
will buy up the certificates bearing &s;ix per cent. when placed on a &s;olid footing. Is that a &s;ufficient objection again&s;t providing for the public creditors? And if not in one ca&s;e, why in the other? The practice &s;ome men have of affirming to-day, and denying to-morrow, is neither decent nor becoming. A griev|ous complaint is made of the want of money, and yet as grievous a complaint of the only means to obtain any. We have it not at home, and we mu&s;t not receive it from abroad. Do the&s;e gen|tlemen &s;uppo&s;e it will rain money now, as it did manna of old? And becau&s;e they have the &s;ame perver&s;ene&s;s with the children of I&s;rael, do they expect the &s;ame miracle? To experience a want of public credit is (they &s;ay) <HI>terrible,</HI> but to de&s;troy the only means of &s;upporting public credit, is (they &s;ay) <HI>de&s;irable.</HI> Let us appeal to facts. No country on earth enjoys exten&s;ive cre|dit which has not a public Bank. We have our&s;elves experien|ced its good effects, when we were in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. And &s;hall we now be told that the Bank mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, and yet public credit be &s;upported? People who &s;peak in this way &s;hew great ignorance, or &s;omething wor&s;e. They a&s;k how a Bank contributes to public credit; and (if no reply be made) think they have gained a victory, when they have puzzled an oppo|nent. For the &s;ake of tho&s;e who love truth, and not with any hope of making &s;uch men &s;en&s;ible either to &s;hame or conviction, their que&s;tion &s;hall be an&s;wered. The Bank may be likened to that which bears the &s;ame name, a bank or dam for collect|ing the waters. After a head is rai&s;ed, &s;ome part turns the wheels of the mill, and &s;ome part waters the adjacent grounds. Take the bank away, and the water will &s;till flow, but not with the &s;ame beneficial effect. If revenues were appropriated to the intere&s;t of the public debt, and other important objects of go|vernment; &s;hould any delay take place in collections, a &s;imilar delay of payment would al&s;o happen. The want of punctuali|ty, would le&s;&s;en the value of &s;tock. And, on the other hand, if collections were more rapid than the payments, much money might be taken out of circulation, and lodged in the public cof|fers. The con&s;equence would be, either that commerce mu&s;t &s;uffer (as at pre&s;ent) for the want of it, or that the &s;tate mu&s;t procure more money than is nece&s;&s;ary; which might not be very ea&s;y, if we may judge from pa&s;t experience. But with the aid of a Bank, the &s;ame &s;tream turns the wheel, and fertilizes the ground; being prudently applied to either purpo&s;e as occa&s;ion requires. And &s;o the &s;ame &s;um of money, will not only &s;upply the bu&s;ine&s;s of the merchant and of the &s;tate, but the funds proceeding
<PB N="15" REF="018897_0014_0FA82B27CDD32F40">
from trade, and tho&s;e ari&s;ing from taxes, will (when thrown into the &s;ame ma&s;s) mutually aid the operations of each, and jointly &s;e|cure the objects of both. Nor is there the lea&s;t danger that foreign|ers will hold even a great proportion of the bank &s;tock. Bank &s;tock will always be mo&s;t u&s;eful for the mercantile man who lives on the &s;pot. Becau&s;e he (and he alone) can at once receive the divi|dend, and when occa&s;ion requires have (by loan for a &s;hort time) the u&s;e of his money: So that he will naturally outbid the fo|reigner. And as the object of the foreigner mu&s;t be to &s;ecure a certain annual income from his funds, make but the intere&s;t of the public debt as regular and &s;afe as the bank dividend, (which by means of the Bank is ea&s;ily done) and the foreigner will as naturally wi&s;h to change bank &s;tock, for an amount of funded loan office certificates yielding more annual intere&s;t, as the mer|chant will to change &s;uch an amount of certificates for bank &s;tock. And &s;o far from any danger to the State, by the intere&s;t of foreigners in their funds, there is a great &s;ecurity. Every fo|reign creditor is an advocate for us with his own government, in times of public calamity, and is induced to lend more, as the means of &s;ecuring what has been already lent; e&s;pecially if he has been regularly paid the intere&s;t of his capital.</P>
<P>The next objection again&s;t the Bank is, that the payment of the dividend to foreigners will be a drain of &s;pecie from the country. This has already been an&s;wered in part, but farther; a man who has bought a piece of ground, wants to borrow mo|ney for the purpo&s;e of clearing, fencing, draining and culti|vating it. He would not reli&s;h the advice of a neighbour who might tell him not to borrow, le&s;t the payment of intere&s;t &s;hould drain him of ca&s;h. He might indeed be glad to get the money at a low intere&s;t, or for no intere&s;t, but he would certainly get it if he could; and by indu&s;trious attention, and a prudent ap|plication of it, he would pay both principal and intere&s;t from the profits of his farm. And thus by degrees a wilderne&s;s is con|verted into beautiful cultivation. From the di&s;covery of Ame|rica to the pre&s;ent hour, we have been paying intere&s;t for what we owe on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic. Our debt and our pro|&s;perity have gone hand in hand. And yet when people now complain of the difficulty of borrowing money, they mu&s;t be told it is for their advantage not to obtain the principal, becau&s;e they will not (in that ca&s;e) be obliged to pay the intere&s;t. If a farmer in Penn&s;ylvania has to pay annually five pounds for the u&s;e of a hundred pounds borrowed, is it of any con&s;equence to him whether the lender lives in Philadelphia, New-York,
<PB N="16" REF="018897_0015_0FA82B28A7FFA3A8">
Bo&s;ton, London, or Am&s;terdam? Twenty bu&s;hels of wheat do the bu&s;ine&s;s. And when he has parted with them, whether they are eaten in Philadelphia, or &s;ent to Li&s;bon, is none of his affair. On the large &s;cale, indeed, it might be convenient that wealthy men &s;hould cro&s;s the Atlantic to become citizens of Penn&s;ylvania; and &s;o they will, if equal ju&s;t laws, and a mild firm admini&s;tration give that &s;ecurity to property without which it is a cur&s;e in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing. But if bad laws be made, or the good laws be badly executed, and if &s;olid e&s;ta|bli&s;hments can be overturned by every capricious breath, the wi&s;e and the good will avoid us as they would the pe&s;tilence. Then indeed there will be a con&s;tant drain of wealth, for <HI>none will leave property in a country where it is in&s;ecure.</HI></P>
<P>But farther, though we admit that borrowing does every year carry a &s;um out of the country for payment of intere&s;t, it will not follow that the country is impoveri&s;hed by the amount of that &s;um. When a farmer wants nece&s;&s;aries, and has not ca&s;h, he mu&s;t either take them on tru&s;t, or borrow money on intere&s;t. Every body knows that the difference between buying with rea|dy money, and buying on credit, is much greater than the in|tere&s;t on the price of the goods, and therefore it is cheaper for the farmer to borrow, than to run in debt at the &s;tore. Ju&s;t &s;o it is with the country. Mo&s;t of the articles we want (when pur|cha&s;ed at the fir&s;t hand) mu&s;t be immediately paid for; and when merchants abroad lay out their ca&s;h to buy goods, and after &s;ell them to us on credit, we pay (in the price of &s;uch goods) not on|ly an intere&s;t on the purcha&s;e money, but for the trouble foreign merchants take, and the ri&s;que they run. To all this is added a hand&s;ome commi&s;&s;ion, and then a round profit into the bargain. Thus, for in&s;tance, &s;ince it has been the practice to buy tea with ca&s;h at the fir&s;t hand, we get that article for nearly one half of what it u&s;ed to co&s;t. Let any man therefore calculate the difference between paying fifty pound per annum in&s;tead of a hundred, in price, and &s;ix per cent (or even ten per cent) per an|num for intere&s;t on the fifty, and he will be convinced that we are recompenced five fold for the dividend paid abroad. On the whole, the matter &s;tands thus. The merchant who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, and who mu&s;t for that rea&s;on be the be&s;t judge, tells you that the advance of money by foreigners for bank &s;tock, and the facility which the Bank can thereby give to commercial opera|tions, enable him to carry on bu&s;ine&s;s more advantageou&s;ly though he &s;ells imported commodities lower, and buys produce higher, than before the war. The farmer (who perhaps neither
<PB N="17" REF="018897_0016_0FA82B295A5F28E0">
comprehends nor cares for the rea&s;ons on which this a&s;&s;ertion may be founded) prudently brings it to the te&s;t of experience. The tree (&s;ays he) is known by its fruits. Let me examine the facts. He does &s;o, and finds that mo&s;t of the articles imported can be purcha&s;ed for much le&s;s than formerly and that he can get half as much again for his wheat. So that duties properly laid on ar|ticles, the con&s;umption of which is chiefly unnece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ome|times pernicious, would pay the intere&s;t of the public debts and not co&s;t the con&s;umer more than before the war. Thus, without impo&s;ing new burthens, full relief may be given to the public creditors, and they be thereby enabled more chear|fully and more ea&s;ily to &s;u&s;tain their &s;hare of &s;uch burthens as circum&s;tances may hereafter require. All which advantages we mu&s;t (it &s;eems) forego, and preclude our&s;elves from the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of e&s;tabli&s;hing public credit, le&s;t foreigners &s;hould derive an intere&s;t on lending us money. Overturn the Bank &s;ay they and perhaps you may get a little of their money. Kill the goo&s;e that lays golden eggs, and you may wear her feathers.</P>
<P>Sixthly, it has been &s;aid that the Bank facilitates the export|ation of &s;pecie. Of all the charges in the world, this is the la&s;t which one would have expected. The operations of the Bank depend (as every body knows) on the quantity of &s;pecie in their vaults. When that is gone, the Bank is done, ju&s;t as the mill &s;tands &s;till when the pond is dry. And therefore to &s;uppo&s;e the directors would facilitate the exportation of coin, is the mo&s;t ab&s;urd of all &s;uppo&s;itions. Truth is, the directors of the Bank are extremely &s;olicitous to prevent the exportation of coin, and happily for the &s;tate, have the means in their power. The Bank capital is about a million of dollars, part of which is in their vaults, and the remainder lent for &s;hort periods. The amount of their loans is &s;uppo&s;ed to be twice as much as their capital. A part of the &s;um lent is in bank notes, the remainder in coin. Now therefore when the directors find that ca&s;h is ex|ported (which they do at once, by perceiving that any con&s;ider|able &s;um goes out of the Bank in a week more than is received) they are not meerly led by inclination, but driven by nece&s;&s;ity, to le&s;&s;en or to &s;top their di&s;counts, according to the nature of the ca&s;e and the degree of the evil. This &s;toppage has the effect; for not only the money is prevented from going abroad, but if the &s;toppage continue, it is brought in from every quarter. The operation is &s;o powerful, that on one occa&s;ion many thou&s;and dollars were brought to the Bank, and there taken out of tho&s;e
<PB N="18" REF="018897_0017_0FA82B2A215CE4C0">
packages in which they were (next morning) to have been &s;hip|ped to London.</P>
<P>In this place it may be proper to notice the &s;trange opinion, that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trade a bank is injurious. This opi|nion &s;eems to have been founded on the idea, that becau&s;e mo|ney is collected in the Bank it may ea&s;ily be taken out of the Bank. And &s;o indeed it might by an armed force, but tho&s;e who have tried the experiment in any other way have been di&s;|appointed. The money is collected in bank 'tis true, but how is a man to get it out? Either he mu&s;t &s;ell property for the pur|po&s;e, and then it is of no con&s;equence whether the payment comes out of the Bank, or out of the Trea&s;ury, or where it comes from. The owner may di&s;po&s;e of it as he thinks meet; and we might as well &s;ay that David Rittenhou&s;e, E&s;q. facili|tates the exportation of money, when he pays for arms or cloth|ing to a merchant who &s;ends it to Europe, as lay that blame on the Bank. The other mode of getting at money in bank, is by borrowing for the &s;hort period of forty days, and if the bor|rower &s;hips it off, he will be obliged (when the forty days ex|pire) to hunt for it, and will &s;ometimes pay dearly for his trick. Perhaps it will be found on examination that &s;ome of tho&s;e who complain of being driven to deal with u&s;urers, had been dabbling in this way, and proved too cunning for them|&s;elves, as cunning men generally do. So far is the Bank from being injurious to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trade, that the conver&s;e of the propo&s;ition is true, viz. that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trade is in|jurious to the Bank. And it would have been ruinous to the commonwealth, but for the &s;ea&s;onable checks given by the Bank, which checks are among the cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent com|plaints. They &s;ay the Bank facilitates the exportation of coin, and that therefore they complain; but in truth the Bank pre|vented them from exporting the coin, and therefore they com|plain. While a man &s;pends more than he earns, his coin mu&s;t go to pay the difference, and he will have le&s;s of it when the year ends than when it began. Ju&s;t &s;o it is with a country. We import great quantities of goods, we either cannot or will not give produce on moderate terms to pay for them, and yet we grumble that our ca&s;h runs low. We will not acknowledge our own imprudence, but accu&s;e the Bank, which has alone re&s;i&s;t|ed the general torrent; by which means Penn&s;ylvania is better off than any of the neighbouring &s;tates.</P>
<P>A &s;eventh objection again&s;t the Bank is that it injures the cir|culation of bills of credit. This is a popular argument and there|fore it is made. But as to the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion, the authors
<PB N="19" REF="018897_0018_0FA82B2ACCE47210">
do not trouble their heads about it. Their maxim is, Let us lay it on and let them take it off as they can. Some will &s;tick. Suppo&s;e this kind of morality were extended a little, and when the&s;e charitable kind hearted people walk the &s;treets one of their pro&s;elytes &s;hould bedaub them with the contents of the kennel, hugging him&s;elf in the idea <HI>that &s;ome will &s;tick,</HI> would they not find the practice of their own principles rather unplea&s;ant? Pray how has the Bank injured the circulation of paper money? Why the paper is not received in bank as &s;pecie. And did ever any man &s;uppo&s;e it would, or could, be &s;o received? If it had, would not the directors have been guilty of an infamous breach of tru&s;t? Could they have excu&s;ed them&s;elves to tho&s;e of who&s;e &s;pecie they had the cu&s;tody? The Bank might indeed have giv|en currency to the bills, as long as their coin la&s;ted, by ex|changing one for t'other; and no one can doubt that in this ca&s;e the coin would, as fa&s;t as exchanged, have been packed up and &s;ent to our good friends and favorites in London. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, tho&s;e candid Gentlemen who prayed and voted for paper currency, and afterwards refu&s;ed to receive it, would perhaps have played their patriotic game quite through. And we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e too, that when the coffers of the Bank were filled with their emi&s;&s;ions, they would have found as good rea&s;ons to aboli&s;h the paper, as they now do to aboli&s;h the Bank. If a refu&s;al to give money for bills of credit be an injury, what &s;hall be &s;aid for tho&s;e who (though patrons of the plan) would neither give money nor any thing el&s;e for the bills. It would be difficult to make an apology, if the generality of the refu&s;al were not a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for each individual. Let us then be candid, and far from reprehending the practice, calmly &s;eek the cau&s;e. Paper can only circulate on a par with &s;pecie, from a general belief that it is equal to &s;pecie. The faith makes the thing. If there be not &s;uch a general belief, it cannot be equal to coin, becau&s;e it will not &s;o generally an&s;wer the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e. The holder may think (as in the continental times) that his three pound bill is worth eight dollars, and be very angry that his neighbour is not of the &s;ame opinion. But unle&s;s he can per&s;uade the per&s;on who&s;e goods he wants, that the paper is really equal to the &s;ilver, his own conviction will be of &s;mall avail. Admitting then, for argument &s;ake, that every merchant in Philadelphia did really and truly believe the new bills to be worth what they &s;pecify; &s;till they could do no|thing with them, unle&s;s the farmers (who&s;e produce they want to purcha&s;e) had the &s;ame belief, and would &s;ell that produce for paper as freely as for gold. Becau&s;e the merchants being
<PB N="20" REF="018897_0019_0FA82B2B8B97D5A0">
either in debt, or wanting to purcha&s;e goods, in foreign coun|tries, can make no other u&s;e of the paper than to buy &s;uch things as may be &s;ent abroad. And further, they mu&s;t be able to buy not only &s;uch things, but at &s;uch prices, as may an&s;wer in foreign markets. If, therefore, the country Gentlemen will agree to &s;ell wheat for five &s;hillings the bu&s;hel in paper money, merchants will be as &s;olicitous to receive, as they are now to avoid paper. But while produce continues at the pre&s;ent prices, wi&s;e merchants will not &s;ell but for &s;pecie, which they can export &s;afely, becau&s;e they mu&s;t lo&s;e by &s;ending away produce; a practice which &s;ome have pur&s;ued to their ruin. Having thus hinted at the true means to give paper a bri&s;k and lively circulation, candor requires that a few words be &s;aid in favor of the landed intere&s;t, on whom the blame might otherwi&s;e be thrown. Suppo&s;ing, therefore, the charge to be made again&s;t an hone&s;t farmer, he would perhaps make the following reply&mdash; How can it be expected that I &s;hould repo&s;e confidence in go|vernment, who for eight years pa&s;t have been the victim of that confidence? A piece of my land was &s;old for continental bills; the&s;e are all &s;unk in the gulph of depreciation. Part of my pro|perty was &s;eized by officers of Congre&s;s, and part was &s;old to officers of the &s;tate. For all this I have nothing but u&s;ele&s;s cer|tificates. When every body had grown &s;ick of the old money, Congre&s;s i&s;&s;ued new, and though experience was again&s;t the mea&s;ure, yet (relying on their wi&s;dom) I took the new bills chearfully; but found, to my &s;orrow, that the new travelled in the &s;ame road with the old, and the only difference was that they travelled fa&s;ter. The bills i&s;&s;ued (about that time) by the &s;tate, had what they call funds for redemption, but they &s;oon fell to &s;ix for one. I have ob&s;erved too, that when the&s;e bills become of little value, the government joins in and agrees to the depreciation; &s;o that every one who receives them is &s;ure to &s;uffer in the end. Now, therefore, until I have eight years experience that government may &s;afely be tru&s;ted, I cannot forego the benefit of that experience which I have bought &s;o dear. By tru&s;ting government, one half my &s;ub&s;tance is gone; the other half mu&s;t be kept to provide for my family.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons, or rea&s;ons like the&s;e, are not confined to any one body of men, either merchants, hu&s;bandmen or manufac|turers. They pervade all ranks and degrees. The citizens of Penn&s;ylvania will not give free circulation to the &s;tate paper, becau&s;e they have not confidence in the government. We know that confidence cannot otherwi&s;e be e&s;tabli&s;hed, than by the &s;tea|dy pur&s;uit of ju&s;t mea&s;ures, for a number of years. It is &s;elf evi|dent,
<PB N="21" REF="018897_0020_0FA82B2C49EC7F30">
and every man mu&s;t feel as well as &s;ee it. Every man therefore can judge of the excellent &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e who cry, down with the Bank if you could give circulation to the bills. <HI>Break a promi&s;e made three years ago, by way of inducing men to rely on the promi&s;e you make now.</HI></P>
<P>But eighthly, it is &s;aid that the wealth and influence of the Bank may become dangerous to the government. It is a politi|cal mon&s;ter who&s;e property may be ten millions of dollars, who&s;e duration is perpetual. The&s;e circum&s;tances are &s;o terrible, that &s;ome are for putting the poor mon&s;ter to in&s;tant death, while others (in their great goodne&s;s) would only give him a hectic which &s;hould work his di&s;&s;olution in a dozen years. Of each in turn, but fir&s;t of tho&s;e who would limit the duration of the Bank to a few years, and limit the capital to what &s;uits their own ideas of propriety. The&s;e are really the wor&s;t of the two, for their half way conduct, would be every way wrong. Such a law would be as unju&s;t, and have every e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tance of vio|lence, with the immediate di&s;&s;olution of the charter. And how|ever they may deceive them&s;elves into an opinion of their own lenity, not a man among them would either as juryman or judge, admit it to be a good defence again&s;t a charge of murder that the act had been performed by a &s;low poi&s;on. Public credit mu&s;t &s;uffer alike in both ca&s;es, for in both the rights of private property will be alike violated. What then are the advantages held out? Why it &s;eems, that if the charter be limited to a &s;hort period, the legi&s;lature can (at the expiration) renew it on &s;uch terms and conditions as may to them &s;eem meet. And the&s;e terms or conditions mu&s;t of cour&s;e be &s;ome benefit to the com|monwealth, which could not otherwi&s;e have been obtained. And to prove the&s;e things, the Bank of England is quoted. But the choice of an example is rather unlucky, for that limitation of their charter which one cunning mini&s;ter introduced, other cunning mini&s;ters have at different times taken advantage of, till at la&s;t all the &s;ub&s;tance of the Bank has been &s;queezed out. And for what purpo&s;e? Was it to open navigations? To clear new roads? To extend a lucrative commerce? No it was to &s;up|port the power of the mini&s;ter for the time being, and feed the expence of tho&s;e ruinous wars, which the people would not other|wi&s;e have borne. Standing then on the ground of their experi|ence, let us look forward to the probable con&s;equence of &s;uch a limitation in Penn&s;ylvania. Suppo&s;e the period arrived when the charter is to expire. Is it certain the &s;tate would then want aid from the Bank? If not, the object of the limitation is gone. But even &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;tate &s;hould &s;tand in need, what tempta|tion
<PB N="22" REF="018897_0021_0FA82B2D0ED38C28">
could they offer to obtain relief? Not a prolongation of the charter, becau&s;e the &s;uppo&s;ition implies a breach of the contract made when the Bank was fir&s;t in&s;tituted, and therefore no reli|ance could be placed on any &s;ub&s;equent contract. For if the Bank &s;hould lend to the government, then the cancelling of that debt would be an additional motive for di&s;&s;olving the Bank. Nor is this &s;u&s;picion injurious, for one act of moral turpitude is always the prelude of another. But admitting that the Bank would purcha&s;e a few years exi&s;tence; from whom would the purcha&s;e be made, and for what price? The directors of that day, would naturally ca&s;t their eyes on the leading members in A&s;&s;embly, and open the negociation with them. Men of great wealth and in|fluence (&s;hould any &s;uch ari&s;e) would make u&s;e of the Bank to ex|tend and increa&s;e their authority. They would watch this mo|ment to obtain &s;eats in A&s;&s;embly. And if a majority could be prevailed on to vote with &s;uch leaders, the purcha&s;e would be made of them, and <HI>the price would be &s;ome private gain, and no the public good.</HI> In like manner, if the capital be limited, it is not the &s;tate but great men in the &s;tate would receive the benefit of an enlargement. And why &s;hould the capital be limited within narrower bounds than at pre&s;ent? It is notorious that if the di|rectors had not been under compul&s;ion they would not have ex|tended the &s;ub&s;cription beyond the fir&s;t four hundred thou&s;and dollars. It is notorious al&s;o, that every addition to the number of &s;hares le&s;&s;ens the value of each. And therefore we have the be&s;t &s;ecurity in the world, (the intere&s;t of the proprietors them|&s;elves) again&s;t an increa&s;e of the capital. In like manner there is every rea&s;on to believe that the Bank will continue to afford that aid to government, which has never yet been withheld when it could with propriety be granted. And if they &s;hould extend their capital (a thing &s;o contrary to their intere&s;t) it can only be on &s;ome trying occa&s;ion, to &s;upport the government of which they are citizens, and pre&s;erve the &s;hip in which all are embarked. The charter being held &s;acred (as chartered rights ought ever to be) applications for aid by the &s;tate, will be plain and manly tran&s;actions, not dirty jobs. The Bank will candid|ly &s;tate their means, the extent to which they are willing to go, and the &s;ecurity they are willing to accept. They will perhaps (on &s;uch an occa&s;ion) point out the ill treatment they have re|ceived when funds appropriated by the A&s;&s;embly to payment of a former loan, were diverted to another object: and in their quality of citizens as well as that of directors, they will perhaps go a little farther, and &s;tate with becoming firmne&s;s the dangers which mu&s;t en&s;ue <HI>if any individual &s;hall dare to alter appropriations
<PB N="23" REF="018897_0022_0FA82B2DCAF4BBB8">
of public money made by legi&s;lative authority.</HI> But &s;urely this can do no harm. Calm reflection will therefore convince a candid man, that the wealth and influence of the Bank can only become dan|gerous to the &s;tate, by laying it at the mercy of great men in the &s;tate. For it is utterly inconceivable that four or five hundred &s;tockholders, (of all ranks, parties and denominations) &s;hould join in chu&s;ing directors who would attempt to overturn the go|vernment. On the contrary it is a truth vouched by uniform ex|perience (from the earlie&s;t ages) that the monied intere&s;t of a country will ever oppo&s;e, check, and counteract, all changes and convul&s;ions of government; becau&s;e that intere&s;t is &s;ure to be the victim of confu&s;ion and di&s;order. This la&s;t con&s;ideration applies forcibly al&s;o to the arguments of tho&s;e who would now di&s;&s;olve the charter. Let them further con&s;ider, that the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of banking is not (of nece&s;&s;ity) to be carried on by public Banks alone. One or more individuals may form a banking com|pany, who&s;e operations will be exten&s;ive and lucrative, in pro|portion to the degree and extent of their credit and connections. Over &s;uch a Bank (or &s;uch Banks) there can be no controul. The citizens of Philadelphia will have no vote in chu&s;ing direct|ors, nor will any per&s;on be particularly intere&s;ted in ob&s;erving their conduct. Di&s;&s;olve the national Bank in March, and by the fir&s;t day of May a private Bank will ri&s;e on its ruins. The merchants of Philadelphia will pour in their coin, with as much confidence as they now do into the national Bank; and experi|ence has &s;o clearly &s;hewn the advantages of &s;uch an in&s;titution, that they will not, cannot, be without it. If therefore the ene|mies of the Bank will look round, and &s;ee who are the men that will probably &s;et up &s;uch a private Bank, it may do more towards bringing them to a right judgment, than the mo&s;t con|clu&s;ive arguments.</P>
<P>The ninth objection is, that the directors can obtain unfair advantages in trade for them&s;elves and their friends. And it mu&s;t be owned, that there is &s;ome force in this objection. But it cannot be alledged that the &s;uppo&s;ed advantages are unfair. Some advantages are nece&s;&s;arily attendant on the place of a di|rector, and &s;ome inconveniencies are as nece&s;&s;arily the ap|pendages.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible that things &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, and the only check is in the annual election, by which the &s;tockholders have an opportunity of te&s;tifying their &s;en&s;e of each director's con|duct. This will always prevent any great mi&s;chief. For the Bank being an in&s;titution in which the money of many acts for
<PB N="24" REF="018897_0023_0FA82B2EB5509710">
the benefit of all, by being jointly applied to each in his turn; every &s;tockholder is a centinel, bound by his private intere&s;t to di&s;cover unfair practices, and &s;ound the alarm, when undue advantages are obtained. Becau&s;e the preference of one, mu&s;t operate the exclu&s;ion of another. After all, however, we mu&s;t acknowledge, that this evil will in &s;ome degree prevail; for we know that nothing on earth is perfect. But mu&s;t we fore|go a great advantage to all, becau&s;e a greater advantage will re&s;ult to a few? We might as well object to the exi&s;tence of government, becau&s;e it mu&s;t be admini&s;tered by fallible men, and confer on them &s;uperior eminence and authority; or to the u&s;e of money, becau&s;e it is &s;ometimes applied to vile purpo&s;es, as object to a money government or bank, becau&s;e the labors of a director are compen&s;ated (or more than compen&s;ated) by commercial advantages.</P>
<P>La&s;tly then, let us con&s;ider whether the Bank be de&s;tructive of that equality which ought to take place in a free country. And the fir&s;t que&s;tion is, whether by equality is meant equality of property, or equality of rights. If it be the former, then it may perhaps be doubted whether the oppo&s;ers of the Bank would them&s;elves agree to an equality (that is to &s;ay, a general divi&s;ion) of property among all the citizens of Penn&s;ylvania. This might &s;uit eight or ten thou&s;and gentlemen who came over la&s;t year, from Ireland and Germany to give us the honor of their good company. But will the &s;ub&s;tantial freeholder, or wealthy mechanick, be willing to pay for that good company &s;uch an exorbitant price? We have in general (it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed) been ready enough to give a preference to &s;trangers, over our own brethren and countrymen, but there is rea&s;on in every thing. If an equality of rights be meant, then the objection va|ni&s;hes, for any man may purcha&s;e the right of a &s;tockholder in the Bank, for le&s;s money than he can purcha&s;e a farm, even in the back counties: So that he may be a &s;tockholder, on ea&s;ier terms than he can be a freeholder. And if it &s;uits one man to be a &s;tockholder and the other to be a freeholder, neither ought to grumble at the rights or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the other. But, if (which is mo&s;t likely) the objectors mean here under a plau&s;ible cry rai&s;ed about equal rights, to cover the dictates of envy at &s;upe|rior fortune and &s;ucce&s;s in the world, then they had be&s;t con&s;ider again, whether by overturning the public Bank they would not a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;etting up a private Bank. And whether &s;uch private
<PB N="25" REF="018897_0024_0FA82B2FF2883010">
Bank, would not bring very great acce&s;&s;ions of wealth to tho&s;e whom they particularly di&s;like.</P>
<P>You, gentlemen of the a&s;&s;embly, who are the guardians of Penn&s;ylvania, and bound by every principle which can actuate hone&s;t men, to promote her welfare and pro&s;perity, it is with you to con&s;ider this great object in all its lights. The objections rai&s;|ed will doubtle&s;s be varied. The an&s;wers given will certainly be di&s;puted. Perhaps the arguments in &s;upport of the Bank, are not &s;o &s;trong as the advocates believe. One thing however is certain, that con&s;equences of the la&s;t importance to your con|&s;tituents, mu&s;t follow from your deci&s;ion. If therefore the e|vent be doubtful, nay if the de&s;truction of this charter &s;hould not be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, pau&s;e a moment and con&s;ider mo&s;t deeply what you are about to do. How can we hope for public peace and national pro&s;perity if the faith of government &s;o &s;o|lemnly pledged, can be &s;o &s;uddenly violated? If private proper|ty can be &s;o lightly infringed? De&s;troy this prop, which once gave us &s;upport, and where will you turn in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s? To whom will ye look for &s;uccour? By what promi&s;es or vows can you hope to obtain confidence? This hour of di&s;tre&s;s will come. It comes to all, and the moment of affliction is known to him alone, who&s;e divine providence exalts or depre&s;&s;es &s;tates and kingdoms. Not by the blind dictates of arbitrary will. Not by a tyrannous and de&s;potic mandate. But in proportion to their obedience or di&s;obedience of his ju&s;t and holy laws. It is he who commands us that we ab&s;tain from wrong. It is he who tells us, "<HI>do unto others as ye would that they &s;hould do unto you.</HI>"</P>
