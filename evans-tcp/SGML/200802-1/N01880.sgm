<HEAD>A Letter from a Gentle|man in <HI>Mount Hope,</HI> to his Friend in <HI>Treamount.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot ea&s;ily Expre&s;s the Great Joy, and Uni|ver&s;al Satisfaction the People in our Parts ma|nife&s;ted, when they heard &s;ome Gentlemen of <HI>Boston,</HI> purpo&s;ed to Meet, Advi&s;e, and Con|&s;ult of proper Ways and Means, to Extricate you and us, out of our almo&s;t In&s;upportable Difficul|ties and Oppre&s;&s;ions, daily and in&s;en&s;ibly, increa&s;ing upon us, for want of a Sufficient Medium of Trade and Commerce. &mdash; And I freely confe&s;s, I was plea&s;ed at it, and almo&s;t per&s;waded to believe, that &s;ome Good would come of it: But our hopes (being built on a &s;andy Foundation) &s;oon fell away; our Rejoycing cea&s;ed, and we were reduced to our former Melancholy Views: and upon the arrival of your La&s;t Weeks Gazette, we were (<HI>Even to a Man,</HI>) wonderfully &s;urprized, and filled with ju&s;t Indigna|tion and Scorn, upon the fir&s;t Reading an <HI>Infamous Adverti&s;ement,</HI> cramm'd into that Gazette, <HI>Pub|li&s;hed by Authority</HI>; in which the Shamele&s;s Author, takes upon him an uncommon freedom (not to call it impudence,) to Ill-Treat Villify, a Reverend and Worthy Gentleman, whom we ever deemed a true and faithful Friend to his Country, and who &s;hew'd

him&s;elf to be &s;uch an One, &s;ome Years pa&s;t, when many Others (con&s;idering their Stations in Govern|ment,) were under &s;tricter Obligations to appear, were afraid to be Gap-men, and prote&s;t again&s;t the Gro&s;s Injuries, Arbitrary and Illegal Actions of the then Go|vernment: and becau&s;e he &s;tood up for the Laws and Rights of his Country, he was &s;ent to Goal, and Su&s;|pended from his Mini&s;try, fined <HI>Fifty Pounds,</HI> paid Co&s;t, and gave l. 1000. Security for his Good Behavi|our, for one Year: &amp; we &s;till conceive the &s;ame thoughts of him; &amp; by what we have Read in his late Well Dige&s;ted Treati&s;e, we pre&s;ume, he endeavour'd after the Ad|vancement of the Publick Weal and Pro&s;perity of his Native Country, notwith&s;tanding all the Di&s;ingenious Flurts, and Invidious Scoffs, of the <HI>Ca&s;tle-William Writer, who</HI> (<HI>no doubt of it,</HI>) rais'd and mu&s;tered, all the Force and Strength he could Command, at that <HI>Fortre&s;s,</HI> (tho' to wor&s;e than no purpo&s;e,) to batter down, and raze the well-grounded Arguments, and rea&s;onable Propo&s;itions, &s;o well laid down, and properly Di&s;played by that Worthy Per&s;on, that his Thundering Cannon made no Impre&s;&s;ion thereon: yet he Conceits in his own brains, that for his Under|taking &s;o de&s;perate an Affair, he is highly worthy of &s;ome Extraordinary Reward; and remarkable Di&s;tinction, to be put upon him: having fully demon|&s;trated his <HI>high Ambition,</HI> as all well Di&s;ciplin'd Sol|diers do, to Serve his <HI>Superior Officer,</HI> to the ut|mo&s;t of his Valour and Conduct: and if his Strong Efforts have not attained tho&s;e Noble Ends, they were &s;o &s;ecretly Contrived for, it is a Misfortune that &s;ometimes attends the be&s;t of De&s;igns, and there|fore he is &s;atisfying him&s;elf, that his Good Will may meet with &s;ome Kind Acceptance.</P>
<P>But, if Men for Projecting Schemes, and finding out Expedients for the Ea&s;e of the People, mu&s;t be brought on the Stage, Maligned, and all that is

<P>Sir, If you find &s;uch Arguments like to prevail, you may a&s;&s;ure all you Conver&s;e with, from me, that the main, if not the only rea&s;on, why you had not a con&s;iderable Number of Men from, and about our parts, to attend <HI>La&s;t Tue&s;day Evening,</HI> fur|ni&s;hed with Draughts, &s;uch as we were capable of framing, was, lea&s;t their weak E&s;&s;ays, if they did not plea&s;e <HI>&s;ome few among you,</HI> and got into their hands, (as Unavoidably they would,) that then, their plain, hone&s;t, well-meaning Attempts would &s;erve to <HI>fill up the next Gazette,</HI> with Opprobrious In|vectives again&s;t them: If not their Names and Per|&s;ons handled, with the &s;ame Scurrillity the late Gen|tleman was entertained with, upon the like Occa&s;ion: for how can we Expect to fare better than he? When the mo&s;t we are able to offer, mu&s;t needs come far &s;hort of what he put forth on that head.</P>
<P>Verily, &s;hould we <HI>Hone&s;t Ru&s;ticks</HI> be Condemned, and hung up without any <HI>Tryal,</HI> in &s;uch an Indecent, and Unmanly Way; I am prone to think Our <HI>Eng|li&s;h Stomachs,</HI> would not Dige&s;t &s;uch Filthy Tra&s;h. And what very much aggravates this matter, and car|ries with it Deep Re&s;entments, is, (If we are rightly Inform'd) that every one that belongs to, and re&s;ides at the Place where this NOBLE atchievement took its Birth, are maintain'd at the Charge of this Province;

daily receive, and Eat their Bread; and Twice a Year at Lea&s;t, &s;end in their <HI>Mu&s;ter Rolls,</HI> and Each Man paid his full Due, and &s;ome very <HI>Extravagant Mu&s;|ter Rolls</HI> (to &s;ay no wor&s;e of them) from thence were found out and Detected by the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives in the La&s;t Se&s;&s;ion; as appears by their Votes and Ju&s;t Repre&s;entation thereof. Now Good Sir, had you &amp; I, and the Generality of the Inhabitants within this Government, the &s;ame Opportunities and Ways, (and would improve them,) of being furni&s;h|ed with <HI>Province Bills</HI> as the Officers and Soldiers at <HI>Ca&s;tle William</HI> have, we might then &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bly &s;ay, and truly Affirm, that for our parts we have enough. But alas! you know, we nor the Generality of the Good People, have no Salleries, Gratuities, or Wages to receive from Mr. Trea&s;urer, but are Oblig'd an|nually to pay into the Trea&s;ury, very Con&s;iderable Rates and Taxes, to Support the Government: all which <HI>hitherto</HI> we have cheerfully comported with; and no &s;mall part of what we pay in, goes out for the Sole U&s;e and Benefit of the <HI>Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> in the Governments pay: So that for any of <HI>that Or|der of Men,</HI> to think to bring into Contempt any, for their Free and Voluntary Enterprizes, and Con|trivances to find out proper Expedients, to enable the Prudent and Laborious, the better to pay their Publick Dues, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their nece&s;&s;ary Affairs, for the Sub&s;i&s;tance of their Wives, and Children, is hard|ly tollerable: who in&s;tead of acknowledging the <HI>Genero&s;ity</HI> of the People towards them, &s;tart up to pull down and ruin their <HI>Benefactors</HI>; the Law of Gratitude is one of the Laws of Nature: <HI>The Ox knows his Owner, and the A&s;s his Ma&s;ters Crib.</HI> But the&s;e things we cannot account for: nor ought they to be Countenanced in any Civilized Govern|ment, and are a Reflection <HI>New-England</HI> was never Tainted with before.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002228_0005_0FDB1903ADBC2528">However, Let us amid&s;t our heavy Pre&s;&s;ures and Perplexities, Keep up our <HI>true Engli&s;h Spirits</HI> and Fortitude, laying fa&s;t hold on our <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Liber|ties,</HI> as being our <HI>best Refuge,</HI> and mo&s;t effectual way, in due time to bring us to rights again; for tho' &s;ome lo&s;s and damage may accrue to our E&s;tates, by rea&s;on of the decay of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Traffick, yet that may and will revive; but if we once come to be depre&s;&s;ed in our Spirits, it will prove far more fatal; and tend to the ruin of our Country, and the lo&s;s of our Native Rights. And &s;hould our Inconveniences continue growing &s;till more and more upon us, and &s;o far get the Ma&s;tery over us, as to bring us into Di&s;pondences, we &s;hould &s;oon Groan under the fatal Con&s;equences of &s;uch a Calamity.</P>
<P>Let us therefore in <HI>no Wi&s;e,</HI> cheri&s;h or harbour &s;uch <HI>Pu&s;&s;ill-animity</HI> within our Brea&s;ts; but put far from us, all &s;uch de&s;picable thoughts. And if there be <HI>any</HI> among us, who would <HI>rejoyce</HI> to &s;ee &s;uch days here, I hope they will be <HI>Di&s;appointed,</HI> and know of a Truth, that <HI>New-England-Men,</HI> cannot abide to be drove; or long led by the No&s;e: and (methinks) if we but look back and Recapitulate the many hard&s;hips (almo&s;t coming up to the Egypti|an Bondage,) which this People <HI>not many Years &s;ince</HI> were Grovelling under: and the Province put under the Admini&s;tration of a <HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Coun|cil,</HI> who &s;ought out &s;o many Intentions to plague and hamper the Inhabitants withal; rai&s;e upon us Taxes without an A&s;&s;embly, Declare our Good and Whol&s;om Laws, to be but a <HI>No&s;e of Wax,</HI> to &s;erve their Unrighteous turns: and the then <HI>Governour</HI> being abetted, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the artful Contrivances, and Wicked In&s;inuations of <HI>&s;ome</HI> of his Council, (and <HI>they this Country Men born too,</HI>) to fill his and their Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers by <HI>Filthy Lucre,</HI> gave out, that for&s;ooth, we had no manner of Right or Pretence to our Lands

and Hou&s;es, for that they all belonged to the Crown; but yet in <HI>Pitty</HI> and <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> if they would take Pattents from <HI>Him,</HI> (which were not attainable with|out con&s;iderable Sums of Money,) <HI>be</HI> would &s;ecure them, in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and the more plau&s;ibly to draw Men into this Gainful (tho' &s;ordid) Projecti|on, <HI>&s;ome of our own Country Men,</HI> and <HI>Councellors,</HI> were the <HI>First</HI> that took up of his Patents; which proved a great Snare to &s;everal, and prevailed upon them to part with their Money, rather than have Writts of Intru&s;ion brought again&s;t them; which they were continually threatned with, and had ju&s;t rea&s;on to Conclude, if they lo&s;t not their Lands, they would be <HI>Sadled</HI> with heavy Bills of Co&s;t, which they mu&s;t di&s;charge or go to Goal.</P>
<P>The Oppre&s;&s;ions, and Grievances that our Fathers lay under, during that Government are too many and too Gro&s;s really (&s;ome of them,) to recount now: and yet they held out, and &s;urmounted tho&s;e In|numerable Calamities: And &s;hall <HI>We</HI> of <HI>their Race</HI> and <HI>Po&s;terity</HI> (even before &s;ome of them, have their Heads laid in the Grave,) e&s;pecially under &s;uch a happy <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> as we now Live and Breath in; &s;hall <HI>we</HI> &s;eem in the lea&s;t to be di&s;mayed for our petty Troubles compared with theirs? Surely no. Have not the People, by our <HI>pre&s;ent Constitution,</HI> the Sole Power and Liberty to Choo&s;e <HI>only &s;uch,</HI> to repre&s;ent them, as will on all fit Occa&s;ions, boldly a&s;&s;ert, and maintain their <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Immunities</HI>; and at all Times &s;incerely promote the Publick Weal and Tranquility of their <HI>Con&s;tituants</HI>? And may they not avoid all, who for the &s;ake of <HI>Perferments,</HI> or fear of loo&s;ing a <HI>Place</HI> or <HI>Pen&s;ion,</HI> will Change their former Notes, and <HI>turn</HI> Courtiers? And if Publick Spirited Men are Cho&s;en to repre&s;ent the People, will it not be their principal Aim and Bent, that the <HI>Council-Board</HI> be filled up with <HI>&s;uch</HI> Gen|tlemen,

who laying a&s;ide all <HI>Private Gain</HI> in their Publick Stations, and Admini&s;tration, will joyn hand in hand with the Repre&s;entative Body, in &s;erving and advancing the Good, and Pro&s;perity of this People?
