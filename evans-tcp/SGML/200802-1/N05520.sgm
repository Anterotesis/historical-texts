<HEAD>TRUE GRACE, Di&s;tingui&s;hed from the EXPERIENCE OF DEVILS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JAMES II. 19.</BIBL>
<Q>Thou believe&s;t that there is one GOD; thou do&s;t well; the Devils al&s;o believe and tremble.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_OBSERVE in the&s;e Words. 1. Something that &s;ome depended on, as an Evidence of their good E&s;tate, and Acceptance, as the Objects of GOD's Favour, <HI>viz.</HI> a &s;peculative Faith, or Belief of the Doctrines of Religion. The great Doctrine of the Exi&s;tence of one only GOD is particularly mentioned; probably, becau&s;e this was a Doctrine wherein, e&s;pecially, there was a vi&s;ible and noted Di&s;tinction, between profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians and the Heathens, among&s;t whom the Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e Days were di&s;per&s;ed: And therefore, this was what many tru&s;ted in, as what recommended 'em <HI>to;</HI> or at lea&s;t, was an Evidence <HI>of,</HI> their Intere&s;t, in the great, &s;piritual and eternal Privileges, in which real Chri&s;tians were di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P N="2">2. How much is allowed concerning this Faith, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is a good Attainment: <HI>Thou do&s;t well.</HI> It was good, as it was nece&s;&s;ary. This Doctrine was one of the funda|mental Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity; and, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, above all others fundamental. It was nece&s;&s;ary to be believed, in order to Salvation: And a Being without the Belief of this Doctrine, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e that had &s;uch Advantage to know, as they had, whom the Apo&s;tle wrote to, would be a great Sin, and what would va&s;tly aggravate their Damnation. This Belief was al&s;o good, as it had a good Tendency in many Re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="4" REF="006996_0004_102ADFF5DE25DD70">
3. What is implicitly denied concerning it, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is any Evidence of a Per&s;on's being in a State of Salvation. The whole Context, &s;hews this to be the De&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle in the Words: And, it is particularly manife&s;t, by the Conclu&s;ion of the Ver&s;e; which is the</P>
<P N="4">4. Thing ob&s;ervable in the Words, <HI>viz.</HI> The Argument by which the Apo&s;tle proves, that this is no Sign of a State of Grace, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is found in the Devils. They believe that there is one GOD, and that He is a holy &s;in-hating GOD; and that He is a GOD of Truth, and will fulfill his Threat|nings, by which He has denounced future Judgments, and a great Encrea&s;e of Mi&s;ery on them; and that He is an Al|mighty GOD, and able to execute his threatned Vengeance upon them.</P>
<P>Therefore, the DOCTRINE I infer from the Words, to make the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e, is this.</P>
<P><HI>Nothing in the Mind of Man, that is of the &s;ame Nature with what the Devils experience, or are the Subjects of, is any &s;ure Sign of &s;aving Grace.</HI></P>
<P>If there be any Thing that the Devils have, or find in them&s;elves, which is an Evidence of the &s;aving Grace of the Spirit of GOD, then the Apo&s;tle's Argument is not good; which is plainly this: <HI>That which is in the Devils, or which they do, is no certain Evidence of Grace. But the Devils believe that there is one</HI> GOD. <HI>Therefore, thy believing that there is one</HI> GOD, <HI>is no &s;ure Evidence that thou art gracious.</HI> So that the whole Foundation of the Apo&s;tle's Argument, lies in that Propo&s;ition: <HI>That which is in the Devils, is no certain Sign of Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I &s;hall mention two or three further Rea&s;ons, or Arguments of the Truth of this Doctrine.</P>
<P>I. The Devils have no Degree of <HI>Holine&s;s:</HI> And there|fore, tho&s;e Things, which are Nothing beyond what they are the Subjects of, cannot be <HI>holy Experiences.</HI></P>
<P>The Devil once was holy; but when he fell, he lo&s;t all his Holine&s;s, and became perfectly wicked. He is the greate&s;t Sinner, and in &s;ome Sen&s;e, the Father of all Sin. John viii. 44. <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the Lu&s;ts of your Father ye will do. He was a Murderer from the Beginning,
<PB N="5" REF="006996_0005_102ADFF80AA02B48">
and abode not in the Truth; becau&s;e there was no Truth in him: When he &s;peaketh a Lie, he &s;peaketh of his own; for he is a Liar, and the Father of it.</HI> 1 John, iii. 8. <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil; for the Devil &s;inneth from the Beginning.</HI> He is often &s;poken of, as by Way of Eminence, THE WICKED ONE. So, Matt. xiii. 19. <HI>Then cometh</HI> the wicked One, <HI>and catcheth away that which was &s;own in his Heart.</HI> V. 38. <HI>The Tares are the Children of</HI> the wicked One. 1 John, ii. 13. <HI>I write unto you young Men, becau&s;e ye have overcome</HI> the wicked One. Chap. iii. 12. <HI>Not as</HI> Cain, <HI>who was of that</HI> wicked One. Chap. v. 18. <HI>Who&s;oever is born of</HI> GOD&mdash;keepeth him&s;elf, <HI>and that</HI> wicked One <HI>toucheth him not.</HI> So the Devils are called <HI>evil Spirits, unclean Spirits, Powers of Darkne&s;s, Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World,</HI> and <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> it &s;elf: Eph. vi. 12. <HI>For we wre&s;tle not again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood; but again&s;t Principalities, again&s;t Powers, again&s;t</HI> the Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World, <HI>again&s;t &s;piritual</HI> Wickedne&s;s <HI>in high Places.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, &s;urely tho&s;e Things which the Minds of Devils are the Subjects of, can have Nothing of the Nature of true Holine&s;s in 'em. The Knowledge and Under&s;tanding which they have of the Things of GOD and Religion, cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the Nature of divine and holy Light, nor any Knowledge that is meerly of the &s;ame Kind. No &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions as are made on their Hearts, can be of a &s;piritual Nature. That Kind of Sen&s;e, which they have of divine Things, however great, cannot be an holy Sen&s;e. Such Affections as move their Hearts, however powerful, cannot be holy Affections. If there be no Holine&s;s in them, as they are in the Devil, there can be no Holine&s;s in them as they are in Man; unle&s;s &s;omething be added to them, beyond what is in them, or they are in the Devil. And if any Thing be added to 'em, then they are not the &s;ame Things; but are &s;omething beyond what Devils are the Subjects of; which is contrary to the Suppo&s;ition; for the Propo&s;ition which I am upon, is, that tho&s;e Things which are of the <HI>&s;ame Nature,</HI> and <HI>Nothing beyond</HI> what Devils are the Subjects of, cannot be holy Ex|periences. 'Tis not the Subject that makes the Affection, or Experience, or Quality holy; but 'tis the Quality that makes the Subject holy.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006996_0006_102ADFF9955A5AB8">
And if tho&s;e Qualities and Experiences, which the Devils are the Subjects of, have Nothing of the Nature of Holine&s;s in them; then they can be no certain Signs, that Per&s;ons which have them, are holy or gracious. There is no certain Sign of true Grace, but tho&s;e Things which are &s;piritual and gracious. 'Tis GOD's Image that is his Seal and Mark, the Stamp, by which tho&s;e that are his, are known. But that, which has Nothing of the Nature of Holine&s;s, has Nothing of this Image. That, which is a &s;ure Sign of Grace, mu&s;t either be &s;omething, which has the Nature and E&s;&s;ence of Grace; or is flowing from, or &s;ome-way belonging to its E&s;&s;ence: For that, which di&s;tingui&s;hes Things one from another, is their E&s;&s;ence, or &s;omething appertaining to their E&s;&s;ence. And therefore, that which is &s;ometimes found wholly without the E&s;&s;ence of Holine&s;s or Grace, can be no e&s;&s;ential, &s;ure, or di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark of Grace.</P>
<P>II. The Devils are not only ab&s;olutely without all true Holine&s;s, but they are not &s;o much as the Subjects of any common Grace.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould imagine, that &s;ome Things may be Signs of Grace, which are not Grace it&s;elf, or which have nothing of the Nature and E&s;&s;ence of Grace and Holine&s;s in them; yet, certainly they will allow, that the Qualifications, which are &s;ure Evidences of Grace, mu&s;t be Things that are near akin to Grace, or having &s;ome remarkable Affinity with it. But the Devils are not only wholly de&s;titute of any true Holi|ne&s;s; but they are at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from it, and have nothing in them, in any wi&s;e akin to it.</P>
<P>There are many in this World, who are wholly de&s;titute of &s;aving Grace, who yet have common Grace: They have no true Holine&s;s, but neverthele&s;s, have &s;omething of that which is called <HI>moral Virtue;</HI> and are the Subjects of &s;ome Degree of the common Influences of the Spirit of GOD. 'Tis &s;o with tho&s;e in general, that live under the Light of the Go&s;pel, and are not given up to judicial Blindne&s;s and Hard|ne&s;s. Yea, tho&s;e that are thus given up, yet have &s;ome Degree of re&s;training Grace, while they live in this World; without which, the Earth could not bear them, and they would in no Mea&s;ure, be tolerable Members of human So|ciety.
<PB N="7" REF="006996_0007_102ADFFB22718CF8">
But when any are damned, or ca&s;t into Hell, as the Devils are, GOD wholly withdraws his re&s;training Grace, and all merciful Influences of his Spirit what&s;oever: And they have neither &s;aving Grace, nor common Grace; neither the <HI>Grace</HI> of the Spirit; nor any of the common <HI>Gifts</HI> of the Spirit; neither true Holine&s;s, nor moral Vertue of any Kind. Hence ari&s;es the va&s;t Increa&s;e of the Exerci&s;e of Wickedne&s;s in the Hearts of Men, when they are damned. And herein is the chief Difference between the damned in Hell, and unregenerate and gracele&s;s Men in this World: Not that wicked Men in this World, have any more Holi|ne&s;s or true Virtue than the damned, or that wicked Men, when they leave this World, have any Principles of Wicked|ne&s;s infu&s;ed into 'em: But when Men are ca&s;t into Hell, GOD perfectly takes away his Spirit from them, as to all it's merciful common Influences, and entirely withdraws from them, all Re&s;traints of his Spirit and good Providence.</P>
<P>III. It is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that a Per&s;on's being in any Re&s;pect as the Devil is, &s;hould be a certain Sign, that he is very unlike, and oppo&s;ite to him; and hereafter, &s;hall not have his Part with him. True Saints are extremely un|like, and contrary to the Devil, both relatively and really. They are &s;o <HI>relatively.</HI> The Devil is the grand Rebel; the chief Enemy of GOD and CHRIST; the Object of GOD's greate&s;t Wrath; a condemned Malefactor, utterly rejected and ca&s;t off by him; forever &s;hut out of his Pre&s;ence; the Pri&s;oner of his Ju&s;tice; an everla&s;ting Inhabitant of the in|fernal World. The Saints, on the contrary, are the Citizens of the heavenly <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> Members of the Family, of the glorious KING of Heaven; the Children of GOD; the Bre|thren and Spou&s;e of his dear Son; Heirs of GOD; Joint-heirs with CHRIST; Kings and Prie&s;ts unto GOD. And they are extremely different <HI>really.</HI> The Devil, on Account of his hateful Nature, and tho&s;e accur&s;ed Di&s;po&s;itions which reign in Him, is called <HI>Satan,</HI> the Adver&s;ary, <HI>Abaddon</HI> and <HI>Apollyon,</HI> the great De&s;troyer, <HI>the Wolf, the roaring Lion, the great Dragon, the old Serpent.</HI> The Saints are repre|&s;ented as GOD's <HI>holy Ones,</HI> his <HI>anointed Ones, the Excellent of the Earth; the Meek of the Earth; Lambs</HI> and <HI>Doves;</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="006996_0008_102ADFFCEB54C218">
CHRIST'S <HI>little Children;</HI> having the <HI>Image of</HI> GOD, <HI>pare in Heart;</HI> GOD'<HI>S Jewels; Lilies in</HI> CHRIST'<HI>S Garden; Plants</HI> of Paradi&s;e; <HI>Stars of Heaven; Temples of the Living GOD.</HI> The Saints, &s;o far as they are Saints, are as diver&s;e from the Devil, as Heaven is from Hell; and much more contrary than Light is to Darkne&s;s: And the eternal State that they are appointed to, is an&s;werably diver&s;e and contrary.</P>
<P>Now it is not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that a being, in any Re&s;pect, as <HI>Satan</HI> is, or the being the Subject of, any of the &s;ame Properties, Qualifications, Affections, or Actions, that are in Him, is any certain Evidence, that Per&s;ons are thus exceeding different from him; and in Circum&s;tances &s;o di|ver&s;e, and appointed to an eternal State, &s;o extremely con|trary in all Re&s;pects. Wicked Men, are in Scripture, called the <HI>Children of the Devil.</HI> Now is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that Men's being, in any Re&s;pect, as the Devil is, can be a certain Sign, that they are not his Children, but the Children of the infinitely Holy and Ble&s;&s;ed GOD? We are in|formed, that wicked Men, &s;hall hereafter, have their Part with Devils; &s;hall be &s;entenced to the &s;ame everla&s;ting Fire, which is prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Now, can a Man's being like the Devil in any Re&s;pect, be a &s;ure Token that he &s;hall not have his Part with Him, but with glorious Angels, and with JESUS CHRIST, dwelling with Him, where he is, that he may behold, and partake of his Glory?</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t USE may lie in &s;everal Inferences, for our <HI>In&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P>I. From what has been &s;aid, it may be infer'd, by Parity of Rea&s;on, that Nothing that <HI>damned Men</HI> do, or ever will Experience, can be any &s;ure Sign of Grace.</P>
<P><HI>Damned Men</HI> are like the <HI>Devils;</HI> are conformed to 'em in Nature and State. They have nothing better in them than the Devils; have no higher Principles in their Hearts; ex|perience nothing, and do nothing of a more excellent Kind: As they are the Children and Servants of the Devil; and as &s;uch &s;hall dwell with him, and be Partakers with him, of the &s;ame Mi&s;ery. As CHRIST &s;ays, concerning the Saints, in their future State; Matt. xxii. 30. That <HI>they &s;hall be as the Angels of</HI> GOD <HI>in Heaven:</HI> So it may be &s;aid concerning ungodly Men, in their future State; that they <HI>&s;hall be as the fallen, wicked Angels in Hell.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006996_0009_102ADFFF773B7338">
Each of the forementioned Rea&s;ons, given to &s;hew the Truth of the Doctrine, with Re&s;pect to Devils, hold good with Re&s;pect to damned Men. Damned Men have no De|gree of Holine&s;s: And therefore, tho&s;e Things, which are nothing beyond what they have, cannot be holy Experiences. So it is true, that the damned Men, are not only ab&s;olutely de&s;titute of all true Holine&s;s, but they have not &s;o much as any common Grace. And la&s;tly, 'tis unrea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e, that a Per&s;on's being in any Re&s;pect, as the damned in Hell are, &s;hould be a certain Sign, that they are very unlike and oppo&s;ite to them, and hereafter, &s;hall not have their Portion with them.</P>
<P>II. We may hence infer, that no Degree of &s;peculative Knowledge of Things, of Religion, is any certain Sign of &s;aving Grace. The Devil, before his Fall, was among tho&s;e bright and glorious Angels of Heaven, which are repre&s;ented as Morning Stars, and Flames of Fire, that excel in Strength and Wi&s;dom. And tho' he be now become &s;inful, yet his Sin has not aboli&s;hed the Faculties of the angelick Nature; as when Man fell, he did not lo&s;e the Faculties of the human Nature. Sin de&s;troys <HI>&s;piritual Principles,</HI> but not the <HI>natural Faculties.</HI> 'Tis true, Sin, when in full Dominion, entirely prevents the Exerci&s;e of the natural Faculties, in holy and &s;piritual Under&s;tanding; and lays many Impediments in the Way of their proper Exerci&s;e in other Re&s;pects: It lays the natural Faculty of Rea&s;on, under great Di&s;advantages, by the many and &s;trong Prejudices, which the Mind is brought under the Power of: And in fallen Men, the Faculties of the Soul, are, doubtle&s;s, greatly impeded in their Exerci&s;e, through that great Weakne&s;s and Di&s;order of the corporeal Organ, which it is &s;trictly united to; which is the Con&s;equence of Sin. But there &s;eems to be nothing in the Nature of Sin, or moral Corruption, that has any Tendency to de&s;troy the natural Capacity; or even to dimini&s;h it, properly &s;peaking. If Sin were of &s;uch a Nature, as nece&s;&s;arily to have that Tendency and Effect; then it might be expected, that wicked Men, in a future State, where they are given up en|tirely to the unre&s;trained Exerci&s;e of their Corruptions and Lu&s;ts, and Sin is, in all Re&s;pects, brought to its greate&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="006996_0010_102AE001E243F130">
Perfection in them, would have the Capacity of their Souls greatly dimini&s;hed: Which we have no Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e; but rather, on the contrary; that their Capacities are greatly enlarged, and that their actual Knowledge is va&s;tly increa&s;ed; and that even with Re&s;pect to the Divine Being, and the Things of Religion, and the great Concerns of the immortal Souls of Men; and that, with Regard to the&s;e Things, the Eyes of wicked Men are open'd; and they, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, emerge out of Darkne&s;s into clear Light, when they go into another World.</P>
<P>The Greatne&s;s of the Abilities of the Devils, may be argued, from the Repre&s;entation in <HI>Eph.</HI> vi. 12, <HI>We wre&s;tle not again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood, but again&s;t Principalities, again&s;t Powers,</HI> &amp;c. The &s;ame may al&s;o be argued, from what the Scripture &s;ays of Satan's Subtilty. <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 1. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 3. <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 10.</P>
<P>And as the Devil has a Faculty of Under&s;tanding of large Capacity, &s;o he is capable of a great &s;peculative Knowledge, of the Things of GOD, and the invi&s;ible and eternal World, as well as other Things; and mu&s;t needs, actually, have a great Under&s;tanding of the&s;e Things; as the&s;e are the Things which have always been chiefly in his View; and as his Cir|cum&s;tances, from his fir&s;t Exi&s;tence, have been &s;uch as have tended chiefly to engage Him to attend to the&s;e Things. Before his Fall, he was one of tho&s;e <HI>Angels, who continually beheld the Face of the Father, which is in Heaven.</HI> And Sin has no Tendency to de&s;troy the Memory: And there|fore, has no Tendency to blot out of it, any &s;peculative Knowledge that was formerly there.</P>
<P>As the Devil's Subtilty, &s;hews his great Capacity; &s;o the Way in which his Subtilty is exerci&s;ed and manife&s;ted; which is principally in his artful Management, with Re&s;pect to Things of Religion; his exceeding &s;ubtil Repre&s;entations, In&s;inuations, Rea&s;onings, and Temptations, concerning the&s;e Things, demon&s;trates his great actual Under&s;tanding of them. As in order to the being a very artful Di&s;putant in any Science, tho' it be only to confound and deceive &s;uch as are conver&s;ant in the Science; a Per&s;on had need to have a great and exten&s;ive Acquaintance with the Things, which pertain to that Science.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006996_0011_102AE00371293098">
Thus the Devil has, undoubtedly a great Degree of &s;pe|culative Knowledge in Divinity; having been, as it were, educated in the be&s;t Divinity School in the Univer&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> The Heaven of Heavens. He mu&s;t needs have &s;uch an exten&s;ive and accurate Knowledge, concerning the Nature and Attributes of GOD, as WE, Worms of the Du&s;t, in our pre&s;ent State, are not capable of. And he mu&s;t have a far more exten&s;ive Knowledge of the Works of GOD; as of the Work of Creation in particular; for he was a Spectator of the Creation of this vi&s;ible World: He was one of tho&s;e <HI>Morning-Stars</HI> that we read of, <HI>Job</HI> xxxviii. 4, 5, 6, 7. who <HI>&s;ang together,</HI> and of tho&s;e <HI>Sons of GOD,</HI> that <HI>&s;houted for Joy, when</HI> GOD <HI>laid the Foundations of the Earth, and laid the Mea&s;ures thereof, and &s;tretched the Line upon it.</HI> And &s;o he mu&s;t have a very great Knowledge of GOD's Works of Providence: He has been a Spectator of the Series of the&s;e Works from the Beginning: He has &s;een how GOD has governed the World in all Ages: He has &s;een the whole Train of GOD's wonderful &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Di&s;pen&s;ations of Provi|dence towards <HI>his Church,</HI> from Generation to Generation. And He has not been an indifferent Spectator; but the great Oppo&s;ition, which there has been between GOD and him, in the whole Cour&s;e of tho&s;e De&s;pen&s;ations; has nece&s;&s;arily, greatly engaged his Attention, in the &s;tricte&s;t Ob&s;ervation of them. He mu&s;t have a great Degree of Knowledge, con|cerning JESUS CHRIST, as the Saviour of Men; and the Nature and Method of the Work of Redemption, and the wonderful Wi&s;dom of GOD in this Contrivance. 'Tis that Work of GOD, wherein, above all others, GOD has acted in Oppo&s;ition to him; and in which he has chiefly &s;et him&s;elf in Oppo&s;ition to GOD. 'Tis with Relation to this Affair, that that mighty Warfare has been maintained, which has been carried on between <HI>Michael</HI> and his Angels, and the Devil and his Angels, through all Ages, from the Beginning of the World; and e&s;pecially, &s;ince Chri&s;t appeared in the World. The Devil has had enough to engage his Attention, to the Steps of Divine Wi&s;dom in this Work; for 'tis to that Wi&s;dom he has oppo&s;ed his Subtilty: And he has &s;een, and found, to his great Di&s;appointment, and un&s;peakable Tor|ment;
<PB N="12" REF="006996_0012_102AE00537303450" MS="y">
how divine Wi&s;dom, as exerci&s;ed in that Work, has baffled and confounded his Devices. He has a great Know|ledge of the Things of another World; for the Things of that World, are in his immediate View. He has a great Knowledge of Heaven; for he has been an Inhabitant of that World of Glory: And he has a great Knowledge of Hell, and the Nature of its Mi&s;ery; for he is the fir&s;t Inha|bitant of Hell; and above all the other Inhabitants, has Experience of its Torment, and has felt them con&s;tantly, for more than Fifty-&s;even Hundred Years. He mu&s;t have a great Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures; for 'tis evident, he is not hindred from knowing what is written there, by the U&s;e he made of the Words of Scripture, in his Temptation of our Saviour. And if he can know, he has much Oppor|tunity to know, and mu&s;t needs have a Di&s;po&s;ition to know, with the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s; that he may, to greater Effect, prevent and wre&s;t the Scripture, and prevent &s;uch an Effect of the Word of GOD on the Hearts of Men, as &s;hall tend to Overthrow his Kingdom. He mu&s;t have a great Know|ledge of the Nature of Mankind, their Capacity, their Di&s;|po&s;itions, and the Corruptions of their Hearts; for he has had long and great Ob&s;ervation and Experience. The Heart of Man, is what he has had chiefly to do with, in his &s;ubtil Devices, mighty Efforts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and indefatigable Operations and Exertions of him&s;elf, from the Beginning of the World. And 'tis evident, that He has a great &s;peculative Knowledge of the Nature of experimental Religion, by his being able to imitate it &s;o artfully, and in &s;uch a Manner, as to <HI>transform him&s;elf into an Angel of Light.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore it is manife&s;t, from my Text and Doctrine, that no Degree of &s;peculative Knowledge of Things of Re|ligion, is any certain Sign of true Piety. Whatever clear Notions a Man may have of the Attributes of GOD, and Doctrine of the Trinity; the Nature of the two Covenants, the OEconomy of the Per&s;ons of the Trinity, and the Part which each Per&s;on has in the Affair of Man's Redemption; if he can Di&s;cour&s;e never &s;o excellently of the Offices of CHRIST, and the Way of Salvation by him, and the admir|able Methods of divine Wi&s;dom; and the Harmony of the
<PB N="13" REF="006996_0013_102AE0081730B4E0">
various Attributes of GOD in that Way; if he can talk never &s;o clearly and exactly of the Method of the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner, and of the Nature of Conver&s;ion, and the Oper|ations of the Spirit of GOD, in applying the Redemption of CHRIST; giving good Di&s;tinctions, happily &s;olving Difficul|ties, and an&s;wering Objections; in a Manner tending greatly to the enlightning the Ignorant, to the Edification of the Church of GOD, and the Conviction of Gain&s;ayers; and the great Increa&s;e of Light in the World: If he has more Knowledge of this Sort than Hundreds of true Saints, of an ordinary Education, and mo&s;t Divines; yet all is no certain Evidence of any Degree of &s;aving Grace in the Heart.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Scripture often &s;peaks of Knowledge of divine Things, as what is peculiar to true Saints; as in John, xvii. <HI>This is eternal Life, that they might know thee, the only true</HI> GOD, <HI>and</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> Matt. xii. 27. <HI>No man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any Man the Father, &s;ave the Son, and he to whom&s;oever the Son will reveal him.</HI> P&s;. ix. 10. <HI>They that know thy Name, will put their Tru&s;t in Thee.</HI> Philip. iii. 8. <HI>I count all Things but Lo&s;s, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>my Lord.</HI> But then, we mu&s;t under&s;tand it of a different Kind of Knowledge, from that &s;peculative Under&s;tanding, which the Devil has to &s;o great a Degree. It will al&s;o be allowed, that the &s;piritual &s;aving Knowledge of GOD, and divine Things, greatly promotes &s;peculative Knowledge; as it engages the Mind in its Search into Things of this Kind, and much a&s;&s;i&s;ts to a di&s;tinct Under&s;tanding of them; &s;o that, other Things being equal, they that have &s;piritual Knowledge, are much more likely than others, to have a good doctrinal Acquaintance with Things of Religion; but yet, &s;uch Acquaintance may be no di&s;tingui&s;hing Charac|teri&s;tic of true Saints.</P>
<P>III. It may al&s;o be inferr'd from what has been ob&s;erv'd, that for Per&s;ons meerly to yield a &s;peculative A&s;&s;ent to the Doctrines of Religion as true, is no certain Evidence of a State of Grace. My Text tells us, that the Devils <HI>believe,</HI> and as they believe that there is one GOD, &s;o they believe the Truth of the Doctrines of Religion in general. The Devil
<PB N="14" REF="006996_0014_102AE00A0EB41960" MS="y">
is orthodox in his Faith; he believes the true Scheme of Doctrine; he is no <HI>Dei&s;t, Socinian, Arian, Pelagian,</HI> or <HI>Antinomian;</HI> the Articles of his Faith are all found, and what he is thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed in.</P>
<P>Therefore, for a Per&s;on to believe the Doctrines of Chri|&s;tianity, meerly from the Influence of Things &s;peculative, or from the Force of Arguments, as di&s;cerned only by Specu|lation, is no Evidence of Grace.</P>
<P>Tho' 'tis probably a very rare Thing, for unregenerate Men, to have a &s;trong Per&s;ua&s;ion of the Truth of the Doc|trines of Religion, e&s;pecially, &s;uch of 'em as are very my&s;te|rious, and much above the Comprehen&s;ion of Rea&s;on: Yea, 'tis manife&s;t, that we have no Warrant to determine, that it can never be &s;o, or to look upon &s;uch a Per&s;ua&s;ion, as an infalliable Evidence of Grace; and that no Per&s;on can &s;afely determine his State to be good from &s;uch an Evidence. Yet if He, not only Him&s;elf, &s;eems to be very confident of the Truth of Chri&s;tianity and its Doctrines, but is able to argue mo&s;t &s;trongly for the Proof of them; yet in this, he goes nothing beyond the Devil; who, doubtle&s;s, has a great Knowledge of the rational Arguments, by which the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and its &s;everal Principles are evinced.</P>
<P>And therefore, when the Scripture &s;peaks of <HI>believing that</HI> Je&s;us <HI>is the Son of</HI> GOD, as a &s;ure Evidence of Grace, as in 1. <HI>John</HI> v. 1. and other Places, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood, not of a meer &s;peculative A&s;&s;ent, but of another Kind and Manner of Believing, which is called the Faith of GOD's Elect. <HI>Tit.</HI> i. 1. There is a &s;piritual Conviction of the Truth, which is, a believing with the whole Heart, peculiar to true Saints; of which I would &s;peak particularly by and by.</P>
<P>IV. It may be infer'd, from the Doctrine which has been in&s;i&s;ted on, that 'tis no certain Sign, that Per&s;ons are &s;av|ingly converted; that they have been Subjects of very great Di&s;tre&s;s and Terrors of Mind, through Apprehen&s;ions of GOD's Wrath, and Fears of Damnation.</P>
<P>That the Devils are the Subjects of great Terrors, through Apprehen&s;ions of GOD's Wrath, and Fears of future Effects of it, is implied in my Text; which &s;peakes not only of
<PB N="15" REF="006996_0015_102AE00BE7280088">
their <HI>Believing,</HI> but <HI>Trembling.</HI> It mu&s;t be no &s;mall Degree of Terror, which &s;hould make tho&s;e Principalities and Powers, tho&s;e mighty, proud and &s;turdy Beings, to tremble.</P>
<P>There are many Terrors, that &s;ome Per&s;ons, who are concerned for their Salvation, are the Subjects of, which are not from any proper Awakenings of Con&s;cience, or Appre|hen&s;ions of Truth; but from melancholy, or frightful Im|pre&s;&s;ions on their Imagination; or &s;ome groundle&s;s Appre|hen&s;ions, and the Delu&s;ions, and fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions of Satan. But if they have had never &s;o great, and long continued Terrors, from real Awakenings, and Convictions of Truth, and Views of Things as they are; this is no more than what is in the Devils, and will be in all wicked Men, in another World. However &s;tupid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s mo&s;t ungodly men are now, all will be effectually awaken'd at la&s;t: There will no &s;uch Thing as &s;lumbering in Hell. There are many that cannot be awaken'd by the mo&s;t &s;olemn Warnings, and awfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Threatnings of the Word of GOD; the mo&s;t alarming Di&s;|cour&s;es from the Pulpit, and the mo&s;t awakening and awful Providences; but all will be thoroughly awaken'd, by the Sound of the la&s;t Trumpet, and the Appearance of CHRIST to Judgment; and all &s;orts will then be fill'd with mo&s;t amazing Terrors, from Apprehen&s;ions of Truth, and &s;eeing Things as they be; when <HI>the Kings of the Earth, and the great Men, and the rich Men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty Men,</HI> (&s;uch as were the mo&s;t lofty and &s;tout|hearted, mo&s;t ready to treat the Things of Religion with Contempt) <HI>&s;hall hide them&s;elves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains; and &s;ay to the Mountains and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the Face of him, that &s;itteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb; for the great Day of his Wrath is come; and who &s;hall be able to &s;tand?</HI> Rev. vi. 15, 16, 17.</P>
<P>Therefore, if Per&s;ons have fir&s;t been awakened, and then afterwards have had Comfort and Joy, 'tis no certain Sign, that their Comforts are of the right Kind, that they were preceded by very great Terrors.</P>
<P>V. It may be further infer'd from the Doctrine, that no Work of the Law on Men's Hearts, in Conviction of Guilt,
<PB N="16" REF="006996_0016_102AE00EB36CCF68">
and ju&s;t De&s;ert of Puni&s;hment, is a &s;ure Argument, that a Per&s;on has been &s;avingly converted.</P>
<P>Not only, are no Awakenings and Terrors, any certain Evidence of this, but no meer legal Work what&s;oever; tho' carried to the utmo&s;t Extent that it can be; Nothing where|in there is no Grace or &s;piritual Light, but only the meer Conviction of natural Con&s;cience, and tho&s;e Acts and Oper|ations of the Mind, which are the Re&s;ult of this; and &s;o are, as it were, meerly forced by the clear Light of Con&s;cience, without the Concurrence of the Heart and Inclination with that Light: I &s;ay the&s;e Things are no certain Sign of the &s;aving Grace of GOD, or that a Per&s;on was ever &s;avingly converted.</P>
<P>The Evidence of this, from my Text and Doctrine, is demon&s;trative; becau&s;e the Devils are the Subjects of the&s;e Things; and all wicked Men that &s;hall finally peri&s;h, will be the Subjects of the &s;ame. Natural Con&s;cience is not extingui|&s;hed in the damned in Hell; but on the contrary, remains, and is there in its greate&s;t Strength, and is brought to it's mo&s;t perfect Exerci&s;e; mo&s;t fully to do its proper Office, as GOD's Vicegerent in the Soul, to condemn tho&s;e Rebels again&s;t the King of Heaven and Earth, and manife&s;t GOD's ju&s;t Wrath and Vengeance, and by that Means to torment them; and be as a never-dying Worm within them. Wretched Men find Means in this World, to blind the Eyes, and &s;top the Mouth of this Vicegerent of a Sin-revenging GOD; but they &s;hall not be able to do it always. In another World, the Eyes and Mouth of Con&s;cience will be fully open'd. GOD will hereafter, make wicked Men to &s;ee and know the&s;e Things, which now they indu&s;triou&s;ly hide their Eyes from; <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> xxxvi. 10, 11. <HI>Let Favour be &s;hewed to the Wicked, yet will he not learn Righteou&s;ne&s;s; in the Land of Uprightne&s;s he will dead unju&s;tly, and will not behold the Maje&s;ty of the Lord. Lord, when thy Hand is lifted up, they will not &s;ee: But they &s;hall &s;ee, and be a&s;hamed for their Envy at the People; ye the Fire of thine Enemies &s;hall de|vour them.</HI> We have this Expre&s;&s;ion often annexed to GOD's Threatnings of Wrath to his Enemies; <HI>And they &s;hall know, that I am the Lord:</HI> This &s;hall be accompli&s;hed by their woful

Experience, and clear Light in their Con&s;ciences, whereby they &s;hall be made to know, whether they will or not; how great and terrible, holy and righteous a GOD <HI>JEHOVAH</HI> is; who&s;e Authority they have di&s;pi&s;ed: And they &s;hall know, that he is righteous and holy in their De&s;truction. This all the Ungodly will be convinced of, at the Day of Judg|ment, by the bringing to Light all their Wickedne&s;s of Heart and Practice; and &s;etting all their Sins, with all their Aggravations, in order, not only in the View of others, even of the whole World, but in the View of their own Con&s;ciences. This is threaten'd, <HI>P&s;.</HI> 1. 21. <HI>The&s;e Things ha&s;t thou done, and I kept Silence: Thou thoughte&s;t that I was altogether &s;uch an One as thy &s;elf.

And therefore, that Day is called <HI>the Day of Wrath, and Reve|lation of the righteous Judgment of</HI> GOD. <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 5. Now Sinners often cavil again&s;t the Ju&s;tice of GOD's Di&s;pen&s;ations, and particularly, the Ju&s;tice of the Puni&s;hment, which GOD threatens for their Sins; excu&s;ing them&s;elves, and con|demning GOD: But when GOD comes to manife&s;t their Wickedne&s;s in the Light of that Day, and to call them to an Account, they will be Speechle&s;s; <HI>Matt.</HI> xxii. 11, 12. <HI>And when the King came to &s;ee the Gue&s;ts, he &s;aw there, a Man which had not on a wedding Grrment: And be &s;aith unto him, Friend, how came&s;t thou in hither, not having a wed|ding Garment? And he was Speechle&s;s.</HI> When the King of Heaven and Earth comes to Judgment, their Con&s;ciences will be &s;o perfectly enlighten'd and convinced, by the All-&s;earching Light, they &s;hall then &s;tand in; that their Mouths will be effectually &s;topped, as to all Excu&s;es for them&s;elves, all Pleading of their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to excu&s;e or ju&s;tify them; and all Objections again&s;t the Ju&s;tice of their Judge; that their Con&s;cience will condemn them only, and not GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="006996_0018_102AE012F28E2768" MS="y">
Therefore, it follows from the Doctrine, that it can be no certain Sign of Grace, that Per&s;ons have had great Convictions of Sin; have had their Sins of Life, with their Aggravations remarkably &s;et before them, &s;o as greatly to affect and ter|rify them; and withal, have had a great Sight of the Wick|edne&s;s of their Hearts, and been convinced of the Greatne&s;s of the Sin of Unbelief, and of the Unexcu&s;eablene&s;s and He|niou&s;ne&s;s of their mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;piritual Iniquities; and have been brought to be convinced of the utter In&s;ufficiency of their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and to de&s;pair of being recom|mended to GOD by it; have been as much brought off from their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as ever any are, under a meer legal Humiliation; have been convinced that they are wholly without Excu&s;e before GOD, and de&s;erve Damnation; and that GOD would be ju&s;t, in executing the threaten'd Puni&s;h|ment upon them, tho' it be &s;o dreadful. All the&s;e Things, will be in all the Ungodly at the Day of Judgment, when they &s;hall &s;tand with Devils, at the Left Hand, and &s;hall be doomed as accur&s;ed, to everla&s;ting Fire, with them.</P>
<P>Indeed there will be no Submi&s;&s;ion in them. Their Con|&s;cience will be convinced, that GOD is ju&s;t in their Condemnation; but yet their Wills will not be bowed to GOD's Ju&s;tice. There will be no Acquie&s;cence of Mind, in that divine Attribute; no yielding of the Soul to GOD's So|vereignty, but the highe&s;t Degree of Enmity and Oppo|&s;ition. A true Submi&s;&s;ion of the Hear and Will, to the Ju&s;tice and Sovereignty of GOD, is therefore allowed to be &s;omething peculiar to true Converts, being &s;omething which the Devils and damned Souls are, and ever will be far from; and which a meer Work of the Law, and Convictions of Con&s;cience, however great and clear, will never bring Men to.</P>
<P>When Sinners are the Subjects of great Convictions of Con&s;cience, and a remarkable Work of the Law; 'tis only a tran&s;acting the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day of Judgment, in the Con&s;cience before Hand: GOD &s;its inthroned in the Con|&s;cience, as at the la&s;t Day, he will &s;it inthroned in the Clouds of Heaven; the Sinner is arraigned, as it were, at GOD's Bar; and GOD appears in his awful Greatne&s;s, as a ju&s;t and

holy, Sin-hating and Sin-revenging GOD, as He will the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. The Sinners Iniquities are brought to Light; his Sins &s;et in Order before him; the hidden Things of Darkne&s;s, and the Coun&s;els of the Heart are made manife&s;t; as it will be then: Many Witne&s;&s;es do, as it were, ri&s;e up again&s;t the Sinner under Convictions of Con&s;cience; as they will again&s;t the Wicked, at the Day of Judgment: And the Books are open'd, particularly the Book of GOD's &s;trict and holy Law, is open'd in the Con&s;cience, and its Rules applied for the Condemnation of the Sinner; which is the Book that will be open'd at the Day of Judgment, as the grand Rule of Judgment, to all &s;uch Wicked Men as have lived under it: And the Sentence of the Law is pronounced again&s;t the Sinner; and the Ju&s;tice of the Sentence made manife&s;t; as it will be at the Day of Judgment. The Conviction of a Sinner at the Day of Judgment, will be a Work of the Law, as well as the Conviction of Con&s;cience in this World: And the Work of the Law (if the Work be <HI>meerly legal</HI>) be&s;ure, is never carried further in the Con&s;ciences of Sinners now, that it will be at that Day, when it's Work will be perfect, in thoroughly &s;topping the Sinner's Mouth. <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 19. <HI>Now we know, that what Things &s;oever the Law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them that are under the Law; that every Mouth may be &s;topped, and all the World may become guilty before GOD.</HI> Every Mouth &s;hall be &s;topped by the Law, either now or hereafter; and all the World &s;hall become &s;en&s;ibly guilty before GOD; guilty of Death, de&s;erving of Damnation.&mdash;And therefore, if Sinners have been the Subjects of a great Work of the Law, and have thus become guilty, and their Mouths have been &s;topp'd; it is no certain Sign that ever they have been converted.</P>
<P>Indeed the Want of a thorough Sen&s;e of Guilt, and De&s;ert of Puni&s;hment, and Conviction of the Ju&s;tice of GOD, in threatning Damnation, is a good Negative Sign; 'tis a Sign that a Per&s;on <HI>never was</HI> converted, and truly brought, with the whole Soul, to embrace CHRIST as a Saviour from this Puni&s;hment: For 'tis ea&s;ily demon&s;trable, that there is no &s;uch Thing as entirely and cordially accepting an Offer from GOD, of a Saviour, from a Puni&s;hment that HE
<PB N="20" REF="006996_0020_102AE016969FEE60">
threatens, which we think we don't de&s;erve. But the having &s;uch a Conviction, is no certain Sign, that Per&s;ons have true Faith, or have ever truly received CHRIST as their Saviour. And if Per&s;ons have great Comfort, Joy, and Confidence, &s;uddenly let into their Minds, after great Convictions, of &s;uch a Kind as has been mention'd; 'tis no infallible Evidence that their Comforts are built on a good Foundation.</P>
<P>'Tis manife&s;t, therefore, that too much Stre&s;s has been laid by many Per&s;ons, on a great Work of the Law, pre|ceding their Comforts: Who &s;eem not only to have look'd on &s;uch a Work of the Law, as nece&s;&s;ary to precede Faith, but al&s;o to have e&s;teem'd it as the chief Evidence of the Truth and Genuine&s;s of &s;ucceeding Faith and Comforts. By this Means it is to be fear'd, very many have been deceiv'd, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd in a fal&s;e Hope. And what is to be &s;een in the Event of Things, in Multitudes of In&s;tances, confirms this. It may be &s;afely allowed, not to be &s;o u&s;ual for great Con|victions of Con&s;cience, to prove abortive, and fail of a good I&s;&s;ue, as for le&s;&s;er Convictions; and that more generally, when the Spirit of GOD proceeds &s;o far with Sinners, in the Work of the Law, as to give 'em a great Sight of their Hearts, and of the Heniou&s;ne&s;s of their &s;piritual Inquities; and to convince 'em that they are without Excu&s;e and that all their Righteou&s;ne&s;s can do nothing to merit GOD's Favours; but that they lie ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to GOD's eternal Vengeance with|out Mercy; a Work of &s;aving Conver&s;ion follows. But we can have no Warrant to &s;ay, it is univer&s;ally &s;o, or to lay it down as an infallible Rule, that when Convictions of Con|&s;cience have gone thus far, &s;aving Faith, and Repentance will &s;urely follow. If any &s;hould think they have Ground for &s;uch a Determination, becau&s;e they can't conceive what End GOD &s;hould have, in carrying a Work of Conviction to &s;uch a Length, and &s;o preparing the Heart for Faith; and after all, never giving &s;aving Faith to the Soul; I de&s;ire it may be con&s;idered, where will be the End of our Doubts and Difficulties, if we think our&s;elves &s;ufficient to determine, &s;o po&s;itively and particularly concerning GOD's Ends and De|&s;igns in what he does. It may be a&s;ked &s;uch an Objector, what is GOD's End in giving a Sinner <HI>any Degree</HI> of the Stri|vings
<PB N="21" REF="006996_0021_102AE018A9311EC8">
of his Spirit, and Conviction of Con&s;cience; when he afterwards &s;uffers it to come to nothing, and to prove in vain? If He may give &s;ome Degree that may finally be in vain; who &s;hall &s;et the Bounds, and &s;ay how great the Degree &s;hall be? Who can, on &s;ure Grounds, determine, that when a Sinner has &s;o much of that Conviction, which the Devils and damned in Hell have; true Faith and eternal Salvation, will be the certain Con&s;equence. This we may certainly de|termine, that, if the Apo&s;tle's Argument in the Text be good, not any Thing what&s;oever, that the Devils have, is certainly connected with &s;uch a Con&s;equence. Seeing Sinners, while &s;uch, are capable of the mo&s;t perfect Convictions, and will have them at the Day of Judgment, and in Hell; who &s;hall &s;ay, that GOD never &s;hall cau&s;e Reprobates to anticipate the future Judgment and Damnation in that Re&s;pect? And if He does &s;o, who &s;hall &s;ay to Him, what doe&s;t Thou? Or call him to Account concerning his Ends in &s;o doing. Not but that many po&s;&s;ible wi&s;e Ends might be thought of, and mention'd, if it were needful, or I had now Room for it.&mdash;The Spirit of GOD, is often quenched, by the Exerci&s;e of the Wickedne&s;s of Men's Hearts, after he has gone far in a Work of Conviction; &s;o that their Convictions never have a good I&s;&s;ue. And who can &s;ay that Sinners, by the Exer|ci&s;e of their Oppo&s;ition and Enmity again&s;t GOD, (which is not at all mortified by the greate&s;t legal Convictions, neither in the Damned in Hell, nor Sinners on Earth) may not provoke GOD to take his Spirit from them, even after He has proceeded the greate&s;t Length in a Work of Con|viction? Who can &s;ay, that GOD never is provoked to de&s;troy &s;ome, after he has brought 'em, as it were, through the Wilderne&s;s, even to the Edge of the Land of Re&s;t? As he &s;lew &s;ome of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> even in the Plains of <HI>Moab.</HI></P>
<P>And let it be con&s;idered, where is our Warrant in Scrip|ture, to make u&s;e of any legal Convictions, or any Method or Order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Events in a Work of the Law; and con&s;equent Comforts, as a &s;ure Sign of Regeneration. The Scripture is abundant, in expre&s;sly mentioning Evidences of Grace, and of a State of Favour with GOD, and Character|i&s;ticks of the true Saints: But where do we ever find &s;uch

Things as the&s;e, among&s;t tho&s;e Evidences? Or where do we find any other Signs in&s;i&s;ted on, be&s;ides Grace it&s;elf, it's Nature, Exerci&s;es and Fruits? The&s;e were the Evidences that <HI>Job</HI> relied upon; The&s;e were the Things that the P&s;almi&s;t, every where in&s;i&s;ts upon, as Evidences of his Sin|cerity: And particularly in the cxix P&s;alm, from the Begin|ning to the End. The&s;e were the Signs that <HI>Hezekiah</HI> tru&s;ted to, in his Sickene&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Characteri&s;ticks given of tho&s;e that are truly happy, by our Saviour, in the Beginning of his Sermon in the Mount. The&s;e are the Things that CHRIST mentions, as the true Evidences of being his real Di&s;ciples, in his la&s;t, and dying Di&s;cour&s;e to his Di&s;ciples, in the xiv. xv. and xvi. Chapters of <HI>John;</HI> and in his interce&s;&s;ary Prayer, Chap. xvii. The&s;e are the Things which the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> often &s;peaks of, as Evidences of his Sincerity, and &s;ure Title to a Crown of Glory. And the&s;e are the Things he often men|tions to others, in his Epi&s;tles, as the proper Evidences of real Chri&s;tianity; a ju&s;tified State, and a Title to Glory. He in&s;i&s;ts on the <HI>Fruits of the Spirit; Love, Joy, Peace, Long-&s;uffering, Gentlene&s;s, Goodne&s;s, Faith, Meekne&s;s, Temperance,</HI> as the proper Evidences of <HI>being</HI> CHRIST's, and <HI>living in the Spirit:</HI> Gal. v. 22.&mdash;25. 'Tis that <HI>Charity,</HI> or divine Love, <HI>which is pure, peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y to be intreated, full of Mercy,</HI> &amp;c. that he in&s;i&s;ts on, as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Evidence of true Godline&s;s; without which, all other Things are Nothing. Such are the Signs which the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> in&s;i&s;ts on, as the proper Evidence, of a truly wi&s;e and good Man: <HI>Jam.</HI> iii. 17. <HI>The Wi&s;dom that is from above, is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y to be intrea|ted, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality, and without Hypocri&s;y.</HI> And &s;uch are the Signs of true Chri&s;ti|anity, which the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> in&s;i&s;ts on, throughout his Epi&s;tles. And we never have any where in the Bible, from the Beginning to the End of it, any other Signs of Godline&s;s given, than &s;uch as the&s;e. If Per&s;ons have &s;uch Things as the&s;e apparently in them, it ought to be determin'd, that they are truly converted, without its being in&s;i&s;ted, that it be fir&s;t known, what Steps or Method the Spirit of GOD
<PB N="23" REF="006996_0023_102AE01CFA92B870">
took, to introduce the&s;e Things into the Soul; which often|times, is altogether untraceable. All the Works of GOD, are, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, un&s;earchable: But the Scripture, often repre&s;ents the Works of the Spirit of GOD, as peculi|arly &s;o; <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> xl. 13. <HI>Who hath directed</HI> the Spirit of the Lord, <HI>or being his Coun&s;ellor, hath taught Him?</HI> Eccle&s;. xi. 5. <HI>As thou knowe&s;t not what is the Way of</HI> the Spirit; <HI>nor how the Bones do grow in the Womb of her that is with Child; &s;o thou knowe&s;t not the Works of GOD, who maketh All.</HI> John iii. 8. <HI>The Wind bloweth where it li&s;teth; and thou heare&s;t the Sound thereof; but can&s;t not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; &s;o is every One that is born of</HI> the Spirit.</P>
<P>VI. It follows from my Text and Doctrine, that it is no certain Sign of Grace, that Per&s;ons have earne&s;t De&s;ires and Longings after Salvation.</P>
<P>The Devils, doubtle&s;s, long for Deliverance from the Mi&s;ery they &s;uffer, and from that greater Mi&s;ery which they expect. It they tremble through Fear of it, they mu&s;t, ne|ce&s;&s;arily, earne&s;tly de&s;ire to be delivered from it. Wicked Men, are in Scripture, repre&s;ented as longing for the Privi|leges of the Righteous, when the Door is &s;hut, and they are &s;hut out from among them: They come to the Door, and cry, <HI>Lord, Lord, open to us.</HI> Therefore, we are not to look on all De&s;ires, or all De&s;ires that are very earne&s;t and vehement, as certain Evidences of a pious Heart. There are earne&s;t De&s;ires of a religious Nature, which the Saints have, that are the proper Breathings of a new Nature, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Qualities of true Saints: But there are al&s;o Long|ings, which unregenerate Men may have, which are often mi&s;taken for Marks of Godline&s;s: They think they hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and have earne&s;t De&s;ires after GOD and CHRIST, and long for Heaven; when indeed, all is to be re&s;olved into De&s;ires of Salvation, from Self-love; and &s;o is a Longing which ari&s;es from no higher Principles, than the earne&s;t De&s;ires of Devils.</P>
<P>VII. It may be infer'd from what has been ob&s;erved; that Per&s;ons who have no Grace, may have a great Appre|hen&s;ion of an external Glory, in Things heavenly and divine;
<PB N="24" REF="006996_0024_102AE01F403CE1F0">
and of what&s;oever is external, pertaining to Things of Re|ligion.</P>
<P>If Per&s;ons have impre&s;s'd &s;trongly on their Minds, Ideas of that &s;ort, which are obtain'd by the external Sen&s;es; whe|ther they are of that Kind that enter by the Ear, as any Kind of Sound; whether it be the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Mu&s;ick, or Words &s;poken of excellent Signification; Words of Scrip|ture, or any other, immediately &s;ugge&s;ted, as tho' they were &s;poken, tho' they &s;eem to be never &s;o &s;uitable to their Ca&s;e, or adapted to the Subject of their Meditations: Or whether they are of that Kind, that are obtained by the Eye, as Ideas of a vi&s;ible Beauty and Glory; a &s;hining Light, an external Glory of Heaven; golden Streets, Walls and Gates of pre|cious Stone; &s;plendid Palaces; glorious Inhabitants, &s;hin|ing fort' as the Sun; a mo&s;t magnificent Throne, &s;urroun|ded by Angels and Saints, in &s;hining Ranks: Or any Thing external, belonging to JESUS CHRIST; either in his humbled State, as of JESUS hanging on the Cro&s;s, with his Crown of Thorns, his Wounds open, and Blood trickling down; or in his glorified State, with awful Maje&s;ty, or ravi&s;hing Beauty and &s;weetne&s;s in his Countenance; his Face &s;hining above the Brightne&s;s of the Sun, and the like: The&s;e Things are no certain Signs of Grace.</P>
<P>Multitudes that are now in Hell, will have Ideas of the external Glory, that pertains to Things heavenly, far beyond what ever any have in this World. They will &s;ee all that external Glory and Beauty, in which CHRIST will appear at the Day of Judgment, when the Sun &s;hall be turned into Darkne&s;s before him; which, doubtle&s;s, will be Ten Thou|&s;and Times greater than ever was impre&s;&s;ed on the Imagination of either Saints or Sinners, in this pre&s;ent State, or ever was conceived by any mortal Man.</P>
<P>VIII. It may be infer'd from the Doctrine, that Per&s;ons who have no Grace, may have a very great and affecting Sen&s;e of many divine Things on their Hearts.</P>
<P>The Devil has not only great &s;peculative Knowledge, but he has a Sen&s;e of many divine Things, which deeply affects him, and is mo&s;t &s;trongly impre&s;s'd on his Heart. As</P>

1. The Devils and damned Souls, have a great Sen&s;e of the <HI>va&s;t Importance</HI> of the Things of another World. They are <HI>in</HI> the invi&s;ible World, and they &s;ee and know how great the Things of that World are: Their Experience teaches 'em in the mo&s;t affecting Manner. They have a great Sen&s;e of the Worth of Salvation, and the Worth of immortal Souls, and the va&s;t Importance of tho&s;e Things, that con|cern Men's eternal Welfare. The Parable in the latter End of the xvi. Chap. of <HI>Luke,</HI> teaches this, in repre&s;enting the <HI>rich Man</HI> in Hell, as intreating that <HI>Lazarus</HI> might be &s;ent <HI>to his five Brothers, to te&s;tify unto them, le&s;t they &s;hould come to that Place of Torment.</HI> They who endure the Torments of Hell, have, doubtle&s;s, a mo&s;t lively and affecting Sen&s;e of the Va&s;tne&s;s of an endle&s;s Eternity; and of the compara|tive. Momentarine&s;s of this Life, and the Vanity of the Concerns and Enjoyments of Time. They are convinced effectually, that all the Things of this World, even tho&s;e that appear greate&s;t and mo&s;t important to the Inhabitants of the Earth, are di&s;picable Trifles, in Compari&s;on of the Things of the eternal World. They have a great Sen&s;e of the Preciou&s;ne&s;s of Time, and of the Means of Grace, and the ine&s;timable Value of the Privileges which they enjoy, which live under the Go&s;pel. They are fully &s;en&s;ible of the Folly of tho&s;e that go on in Sin; neglect their Opportunities; make Light of the Coun&s;els and Warnings of GOD; and bitterly lament their exceeding Folly, in their own Sins; by which they have brought on them&s;elves &s;o great and remedile&s;s Mi&s;ery. When Sinners, by woful Experi|ence, know the dreadful I&s;&s;ue of their evil Way; they will <HI>mourn at the la&s;t, &s;aying, how have I hated In&s;truction, and my Heart de&s;pi&s;ed Reproof, and have not obeyed the Voice of my Teachers, nor inclined mine Ear to them that in&s;tructed me!</HI> Prov. iv. 11, 12, 13.</P>
<P>Therefore, however, true Godline&s;s is now attended with a great Sen&s;e of the Importance of divine Things; and 'tis rare, that Men that have no Grace, do maintain &s;uch a Sen&s;e, in any &s;teady and per&s;evering Manner; yet 'tis manife&s;t, tho&s;e Things are no certain Evidences of Grace. Unregene|rate Men may have a Sen&s;e of the Importance of the Things

of Eternity, and the Vanity of the Things of Time; the Work of immortal Souls; the Preciou&s;ne&s;s of Time and Means of Grace, and the Folly of the Ways of allowed Sin: And may have &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things, as may deeply affect them, and cau&s;e 'em to mourn for their own Sins, and be much concerned for others. Tho' it be true, they have not the&s;e Things in the &s;ame Manner, and in all Re&s;pects, from the &s;ame Principles and Views, as godly Men have them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Devils and damned Men, have a &s;trong and mo&s;t af|fecting Sen&s;e of the awful <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> of GOD. The awful Maje&s;ty of GOD, are greatly made manife&s;t in the Executions of divine Wrath, which they are the Subjects of. The making this known, is one Thing GOD has in De&s;ign, in his Vengeance on his Enemies. <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. 22. <HI>What, if</HI> GOD <HI>willing to &s;hew his Wrath, and to make his Power known, endured with much long &s;uffering the Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath, fitted to De&s;truction?</HI> The Devils tremble before this <HI>great and terrible</HI> GOD, and under a &s;trong Sen&s;e of his <HI>awful Maje&s;ty.</HI> 'Tis greatly manife&s;ted to them, and damned Souls now; but &s;hall be manife&s;ted in a further Degree, in <HI>that Day, when the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from Hea|ven, in flaming Fire, to take Vengeance upon them;</HI> and when they &s;hall earne&s;tly de&s;ire to fly, and <HI>be hid from the Face of Him that &s;its on the Throne, (which &s;hall be, becau&s;e of the Glory of His Maje&s;ty.</HI> I&s;ai. ii. 10.) and when they <HI>&s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting De&s;truction, from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</HI> When CHRIST <HI>comes,</HI> at the la&s;t Day, <HI>in the Glory of his Father, every Eye &s;hall &s;ee him</HI> in that Glory, (in this Re&s;pect, that they &s;hall &s;ee his terrible Maje&s;ty) and they al&s;o that pierced Him: <HI>Rev.</HI> i. 7. Both tho&s;e Devils, and wicked Men, which tor|mented and in&s;ulted Him, when he appeared in Meanne&s;s and Ignominy, &s;hall then &s;ee him in the Glory of his Father.</P>
<P>'Tis evident, therefore, that a Sen&s;e of GOD's terrible Maje&s;ty, is no certain Evidence of &s;aving Grace: For we &s;ee that wicked Men, and Devils are capable of it: Yea, many wicked Men in this World have actually had it. This is a Manife&s;tation, which GOD made of Him&s;elf, in the
<PB N="27" REF="006996_0027_102AE025252D22B8">
Sight of that wicked Congregation at <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> which they &s;aw, and were deeply affected with; <HI>&s;o that all the People that were in the Camp trembled.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Devils and damned Men have &s;ome kind of Conviction and Sen&s;e of all the Attributes of GOD, both natural and moral, that is &s;trong and very affecting.</P>
<P>The Devils know GOD's <HI>almighty Power:</HI> They &s;aw a great Manife&s;tation of it, when they &s;aw GOD lay the Foun|dation of the Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and were much affected with it. And they have &s;een innumerable other great Demon&s;trations of his Power; as in the univer&s;al Deluge, the De&s;truction of <HI>sodom,</HI> the Wonders in <HI>Egypt,</HI> at the Red Sea, and in the Wilderne&s;s; the cau&s;ing the Sun to &s;tand &s;till in <HI>Jo&s;hua'</HI>s Time; and many others. And they had a very affecting Manife&s;tation of GOD's mighty Power on them&s;elves, in ca&s;ting all their Ho&s;ts down from Heaven into Hell; and have continual affecting Experience of it, in GOD's re&s;erving them in &s;trong Chains of Darkne&s;s, and in the &s;trong Pains they feel; and will hereafter, have far more affecting Expe|rience of it, when <HI>they &s;hall be puni&s;hed from the Glory of</HI> GOD's <HI>Power,</HI> with that mighty De&s;truction, which they now tremble in Expectation of. So the Devils have a great Knowledge of the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of GOD: They have had un|speakably, more Opportunity and Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve it, in the Work of Creation, and al&s;o in the Works of Providence, then any mortal Man has ever had; and have been them|&s;elves the Subjects of innumerable affecting Manife&s;tations of it, in GOD's di&s;appointing and confounding them in their mo&s;t &s;ubtil Devices, in &s;o wonderful and amazing a Manner. So they &s;ee and find the <HI>infinite Purity and Holine&s;s</HI> of the divine Nature, in the mo&s;t affecting Manner, as this appears in his infinite Hatred of Sin, in what they feel of the dreadful Effects of that Hatred. They know already, by what they &s;uffer, and will know hereafter to a greater Degree, and far more affecting Manner, that &s;uch is the Oppo&s;ition of GOD's Nature to Sin, that it is like a con&s;uming Fire, that burns with infinite Vehemence again&s;t it: They will feel the vehe|ment Heat of that Fire, in a very dreadful Manner. They al&s;o will &s;ee the Holine&s;s of GOD, as exerci&s;ed in his Love to
<PB N="28" REF="006996_0028_102AE0272F616CD0">
Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s, in what they will &s;ee of the Reward of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, and the Holine&s;s of his People, in the Glory of CHRIST and his Church; which al&s;o will be very affecting to Devils, and wicked Men. And the <HI>exact Ju&s;tice</HI> of GOD, will be manife&s;ted to them in the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t, mo&s;t convincing and mo&s;t affect|ing Light, at the Day of Judgment. When they will al&s;o &s;ee great and affecting Demon&s;trations of the Riches of his <HI>Grace,</HI> in the marvellous Fruits of his Love to the Ve&s;&s;els of Mercy; when they &s;hall &s;ee them at the right Hand of CHRIST, &s;hin|ing as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father, and &s;hall hear the ble&s;&s;ed Sentence pronounced upon them; and will be deeply affected with it; as &s;eems naturally implied in the xiii. Chap. of <HI>Luke,</HI> 28, 29, Ver&s;es. The Devils know GOD's <HI>Truth;</HI> and therefore, they believe his Threatnings, and tremble in Expectation of their Accompli&s;hment. And wicked Men that now doubt his Truth, and dare not tru&s;t his Word; will hereafter, in the mo&s;t convincing affecting Manner, find his Word to be true, in all that he has threat|ned; and will &s;ee that he is faithful to his Promi&s;es, in the Rewards of his Saints. Devils and damned Men, know that GOD is <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>unchangeable;</HI> and therefore, they de&s;pair of there ever being an End to their Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Therefore 'tis manife&s;t, that meerly Per&s;ons having an affecting Sen&s;e of &s;ome, or even of all GOD's Attributes, is no certain Sign, that they have the true Grace of GOD in their Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> Here po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ome may object again&s;t the Force of the foregoing Rea&s;oning. That ungodly Men in this World, are in exceeding different Circum&s;tances, from tho&s;e which the Devils are in; and from tho&s;e which wicked Men will be in, at the Day of Judgment. Tho&s;e Things which are vi&s;ible and pre&s;ent to the&s;e, are now future and invi&s;ible to the other. And wicked Men in this World, are in the Body, that clogs and hinders the Soul, and are encompa&s;&s;ed with Objects that blind and &s;tupify 'em. And therefore, it don't follow, that, becau&s;e the Wicked in another World, have a great Apprehen&s;ion and lively Sen&s;e of &s;uch and &s;uch Things, without Grace, that ungodly Men, in their pre&s;ent State may have the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="006996_0029_102AE02920249788">
<HI>An&s;.</HI> To this I an&s;wer: 'Tis not &s;uppo&s;ed, that ever Men in this Life have all tho&s;e Things which have been; mentioned, to the &s;ame Degree that the Devils and Damned have them. None &s;uppo&s;es that ever any in this Life have Terrors of Con&s;cience to an equal Degree with them. 'Tis not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any mortal Man, whether Godly or Ungodly, has an equal Degree of &s;peculative Knowledge with the Devil. And, as was ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, the Wick|ed, at the Day of Judgment, will have a va&s;tly greater Idea of the external Glory of CHRIST, than ever any have in the pre&s;ent State. So, doubtle&s;s, they will have a far greater Sen&s;e of GOD's awful Greatne&s;s and terrible Maje&s;ty, than any could &s;ub&s;i&s;t under in this frail State. So we may well conclude, that the Devils, and wicked Men in Hell, have a greater and more affecting Sen&s;e of the Va&s;tne&s;s of Eternity, and (in &s;ome Re&s;pects) a greater Sen&s;e of the Importance of the Things of another World, than any here have. And they have al&s;o Longings after Salvation to an higher Degree than any wicked Men in this World.</P>
<P>But yet, it is evident, that Men in this World, may have Things of <HI>the &s;ame Kind</HI> with Devils and damned Men. The &s;ame &s;ort of Light in the Under&s;tanding; the &s;ame Views, and the &s;ame Affections; the &s;ame Sen&s;e of Things, the &s;ame Kind of Impre&s;&s;ions on the Mind, and on the Heart. If the Objection is again&s;t the Conclu&s;ivene&s;s of the Rea&s;on|ing that has been made u&s;e of to prove this; 'tis again&s;t the Conclu&s;ivene&s;s of that Rea&s;oning which is the Apo&s;tle's, more properly than mine. The Apo&s;tle judged it, a con|clu&s;ive Argument, again&s;t &s;uch as thought their <HI>believing there was one</HI> GOD, an Evidence of their being gracious; that the Devils believed the &s;ame. So the Argument is ex|actly the &s;ame, again&s;t &s;uch as think they have Grace, becau&s;e they believe GOD is a <HI>holy</HI> GOD, or becau&s;e they have a Sen&s;e of the <HI>awful Maje&s;ty</HI> of GOD. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of other Things that have been mentioned. My Text has Reference not only to the Act of the Under&s;tandings of Devils in believing, but to that Affection of their Hearts, which accompanies the Views they have: As <HI>trembling</HI> is an Effect of the Affection of the Heart. Which &s;hews, that
<PB N="30" REF="006996_0030_102AE02BC5FE8008">
if Men have both the &s;ame Views of Under&s;tanding, and al&s;o the &s;ame Affections of Heart, that the Devils have, it is no Sign of Grace.</P>
<P>And as to the particular Degree, to which the&s;e Things may be carried in Men, in this World, without Grace; it appears not to be &s;afe, to go about &s;o to a&s;certain and fix it, as to make u&s;e of it as an infallible Rule to determine Men's State. I know not where we have any Rule to go by, to fix the preci&s;e Degree, in which GOD by his Providence, or his common Influences on the Mind, will excite in wicked Men in this World, the &s;ame Views and Affections, which the Wicked have in another World; which 'tis manife&s;t, the former are capable of as well as the latter, having the &s;ame Faculties and Principles of Soul; and which Views and Af|fections, it is evident, they often are actually the Subjects of in &s;ome Degree; &s;ome in a greater, and &s;ome in a le&s;s De|gree. The infallible Evidences of Grace, which are laid down in Scripture, are of another Kind: They are all of a holy and &s;piritual Nature; and therefore, Things of that Kind, which a Heart that is wholly carnal and corrupt, cannot receive, or have any Experience of. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 14.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o here add, that Ob&s;ervation and Experience, in very many In&s;tances, &s;eems to confirm what Scripture and Rea&s;on teaches in the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>The &s;econd U S E may be of <HI>Self-Examination.</HI></P>
<P>Let the Things which have been ob&s;erved, put all on ex|amining them&s;elves, and enquiring whether they have any better Evidences of &s;aving Grace, than &s;uch as have been mentioned.</P>
<P>We &s;ee how the infallible Spirit of GOD, in the Text, plainly repre&s;ents the Things the Devils are the Subjects of, as no &s;ure Sign of Grace. And we have now, in &s;ome In&s;tances, ob|&s;erved how far the Devils, and damned Men go, and will go in their Experience, their Knowledge of divine Things, their Belief of Truth, their Awakenings and Terrors of Con&s;cience, their Conviction of Guilt, and of the Ju&s;tice of GOD, in their eternal dreadful Damnation, their Longings after Salvation, their Sight of the external Glory of CHRIST, and heavenly Things; their Sen&s;e of the va&s;t Importance of the Things of
<PB N="31" REF="006996_0031_102AE02DC5D32E30">
Religion, and another World; their Sen&s;e of the awful Greatne&s;s and terrible Maje&s;ty of GOD, yea, of all GOD's Attributes. The&s;e Things may well put us on &s;erious Self-Examination, whether we have any Thing to Evidence our good E&s;tate, beyond what the Devils are the Subjects of. CHRIST &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Except-your Righteou&s;ne&s;s ex|ceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no Ca&s;e, enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> So the Spirit of CHRIST, in his Apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> does in Effect, &s;ay, in my Text, except what you Experience in your Souls, go be|yond the Experiences of Devils, ye &s;hall, in no Ca&s;e, enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P>Here, it may be, &s;ome will be ready to &s;ay, I have &s;ome|thing be&s;ides all the&s;e Things, which have been mentioned; I have Things which the Devils have not, even <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Joy.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, you may have &s;omething <HI>be&s;ides</HI> the Experien|ces of Devils, and yet, nothing <HI>beyond</HI> them. Tho' the Experience be different, yet it may not be owing to any dif|ferent Principle, but only the different Circum&s;tances, under which the&s;e Principles are exerci&s;ed. The Principles, from whence the forementioned Things in Devils and damned Men do ari&s;e, are the&s;e two, <HI>natural Under&s;tanding,</HI> and <HI>Self-Love.</HI> 'Tis from natural Under&s;tanding or Rea&s;on, that they have &s;uch a Degree of Knowledge in divine Things, and &s;uch a Belief of them. 'Tis from the&s;e Principles of natural Under&s;tanding and Self-Love, as exerci&s;ed about their own Di&s;po&s;itions and Actions, and GOD as their Judge, that they have <HI>natural Con&s;cience;</HI> and have &s;uch Convictions of Con&s;cience, as have been &s;poken of. 'Tis from the&s;e Principles, that they have &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Importance of the Things of Religion, and the eternal World, and &s;uch Longings after Salvation.

CHRIST and his Saints. And that you have a Kind of Love or Gratitude and Joy, which Devils and damned Men have not, may po&s;&s;ibly not ari&s;e from any other Principles in your Heart, different from the&s;e two, but only from the&s;e Prin|ciples, as exerci&s;ed in different Circum&s;tances. As for In|&s;tance; your being a Subject of the re&s;training Grace of GOD, and being under Circum&s;tances of Hope, and the Receipt of Mercy. The natural Under&s;tanding and Self-love of Devils, po&s;&s;ibly might affect them in the &s;ame Man|ner, if they were in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances. If your Love to GOD, has it's fir&s;t Source from Nothing el&s;e than a &s;up|po&s;ed immediate divine Witne&s;s, or any other &s;uppo&s;ed Evidence, that CHRIST died for you in particular, and that GOD loves you; it &s;prings from no higher Principles than Self-love; which is a Principle that reigns in the Hearts of Devils. Self-love is &s;ufficient, without Grace, to cau&s;e Men to love tho&s;e that love them, or that they imagine love them, and make much of them; <HI>Luke</HI> vi. 32. <HI>For if ye love them which love you, what thank have you?

If the Devils go &s;o far as you have heard, even in their Circum&s;tances, being totally ca&s;t off, and given up to unre&s;train'd Wickedne&s;s, being without Hope, knowing that GOD is, and ever will be their Enemy, they &s;uffering his Wrath without Mercy: How far may we rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e they might go, in Imitation of Grace and pious Experience, if they had the &s;ame Degree of Knowledge, as clear Views, and as &s;trong Conviction, under Circum|&s;tances of Hope, and Offers of Mercy; and being the Sub|jects of common Grace, re&s;training their Corruptions, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting and exciting the natural Principles of Rea&s;on, Con|&s;cience, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> Such Things as Devils are the Subjects of; &s;uch great Conviction of Con&s;cience; &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Importance of eternal Things; &s;uch affecting Views of the awful Maje&s;ty, Greatne&s;s, Power, Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice, and

Truth of GOD, and &s;uch a Sen&s;e of his great Grace to the Saints, if they, or any Thing like 'em, &s;hould be in the Heart of a Sinner, in this World; at the &s;ame Time that he, from &s;ome &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion on his Imagination, of CHRIST apearing to him, or &s;weet Words &s;poken to him, or by &s;ome other Means, has &s;uddenly, after great Terrors, imbibed a &s;trong Confidence, that now, this Great GOD, is his Friend and Father, has relea&s;ed, him from all the Mi&s;ery he feared, and has promi&s;ed him eternal Happine&s;s: I &s;ay, &s;uch Things would, doubtle&s;s, va&s;tly heighten his Exta&s;y of Joy, and rai&s;e the Exerci&s;e of natural Gratitude, (that Prin|ciple from whence Sinners love tho&s;e that love them) and would occa&s;ion a great Imitation of many Graces, in &s;trong Exerci&s;es.

<P><HI>Enquiry.</HI> Here po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ome may be ready to enquire, If there may be &s;o many Things, which Men may experience from no higher Principles than are in the Minds and Hearts of Devils; what are tho&s;e Exerci&s;es and Affections, that are of a higher Nature, which I mu&s;t find in my Heart, and which I may ju&s;tly look upon as &s;ure Signs of the &s;aving Grace of GOD's Spirit?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I an&s;wer, Tho&s;e Exerci&s;es and Affections which are good Evidences of Grace, differ from all that the Devils are the Subjects of, and all that can ari&s;e from &s;uch Principles as are in their Hearts, in two Things; <HI>viz.</HI> their <HI>Foun|dation</HI> and their <HI>Tendency.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. They differ in their <HI>Foundation,</HI> or in that belonging to them, which is mo&s;t fundamental in them, and the Foun|dation of all the re&s;t, which pertains to 'em; <HI>viz. An Ap|prehen&s;ion, or Sen&s;e of the &s;upreme holy Beauty, and Com|line&s;s of divine Things, as they are in them&s;elves, or in their own Nature.</HI></P>
<P>This the Devils, and Damned in Hell are, and forever will be entirely de&s;titute of. This the Devils once had, while they &s;tood in their Integrity; but this they wholly lo&s;t, when
<PB N="34" REF="006996_0034_102AE034DAC84AF0">
they fell: And this is the only Thing that can be mention'd, pertaining to the Devil's Apprehen&s;ion and Sen&s;e of the divine Being, that he did lo&s;e. Nothing el&s;e belonging to the Knowledge of GOD, can be devi&s;ed, that he is de&s;titute of. It has been ob&s;erved, that there is no one Attribute of the divine Nature, but what he is &s;en&s;ible of, and knows, and has a &s;trong and very affecting Conviction of; and this I think is evident, and undeniable. But the &s;upream Beauty of the divine Nature, he is altogether blind to: He &s;ees no more of it, than a Man born perfectly blind does of Colours. The great Sight he has of the Attributes of GOD, gives him an Idea, and &s;trong Sen&s;e of his awful Maje&s;ty, but no Idea of his Beauty and Comline&s;s. Tho' he has &s;een &s;o much of GOD's wonderful Works of Power, Wi&s;dom, Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Truth, and his wonderful Works of Grace to Mankind, this &s;o many Thou&s;and Years, and has had Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve them with the &s;tronge&s;t Attention: Yet all &s;erves not to give him the lea&s;t Sen&s;e of his divine Beauty. And tho' the Devils &s;hould continue to exerci&s;e their mighty Powers of Mind, with the &s;tronge&s;t Intention; and &s;hould take Things in all po&s;&s;ible Views, in every Order and Ar|rangement; yet they never will &s;ee this. So little akin, is the Knowledge they have to this, that the great Degrees of that Knowledge, bring them no nearer to it. Yet, the more Knowledge they have of GOD, of that Kind, the more do they hate GOD. That wherein the Beauty of the divine Na|ture, does mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> his Holine&s;s, or moral Excellency, appears, in their Eyes, furthe&s;t from Beauty: 'Tis on that very Account chiefly that he appears hateful to 'em. The more Holine&s;s they &s;ee in him, the more hateful he appears: The greater their Sight is of his Holine&s;s, the higher is their Hatred of him rai&s;ed. And becau&s;e of their Hatred of his Holine&s;s, they hate him the <HI>more,</HI> the <HI>more</HI> they &s;ee of his other Attributes. They would hate a holy Being, whatever his other Attributes were; but they hate &s;uch a holy Being the wor&s;e, for his being in|finitely wi&s;e, and infinitely powerful, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> more than they would do, if they &s;aw in him le&s;s Power, and le&s;s Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="006996_0035_102AE0366F45EDC0">
The Wicked, at the Day of Judgment, will &s;ee every Thing el&s;e in CHRIST, but his Beauty and Amiablene&s;s. There is no one Quality or Property of his Per&s;on, that can be Thought of, but what will be &s;et before them, in the &s;tronge&s;t Light at that Day, but only &s;uch as con&s;i&s;t in this. They will &s;ee him coming in the Clouds of Heaven, <HI>in Power, and great Glory, in the Glory of his Father.</HI> They will have that View of his external Glory, which is va&s;tly beyond what we can have any Imagination of: And they will have the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t convincing Demon&s;trations of all his Attributes and Perfections. They will have a Sen&s;e of his great Maje&s;ty, that will be, as it were, infinitly af|fecting to them. They &s;hall be made to know effectually, <HI>That he is the Lord.</HI> They &s;hall &s;ee what he is, and what he does: His Nature and Works, &s;hall appear in the &s;tronge&s;t View. But his holy and infinite Beauty and Ami|ablene&s;s, which is all in all, and without which every other Quality and Property is Nothing, and wor&s;e than Nothing, they will &s;ee Nothing of.</P>
<P>Therefore, 'tis a Sight or Sen&s;e of this that, is the Thing, wherein does fundamentally con&s;i&s;t, the Difference between tho&s;e Things in which the &s;aving Grace of GOD's Spirit con|&s;i&s;ts, and the Experiences of Devils and damned Souls. This is the Foundation of every Thing el&s;e that is di&s;tingui&s;hing in true Chri&s;tian Experience. This is the Foundation of the Faith of GOD's Elect. This gives the Mind a &s;aving Belief of the Truth of divine Things. 'Tis a View of the Excel|lency of the Things exhibited in the Go&s;pel, or Sen&s;e of the divine Beauty, and Amiablene&s;s of the Scheme of Doctrine there exhibited, that &s;avingly convinces the Mind, that it is indeed divine, or of GOD. This Account of the Matter is plainly implied: 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 3, 4. <HI>But if our Go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t; in whom the GOD of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that BELIEVE NOT; le&s;t the Light of the glorious Go&s;pel of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>who is the Image of</HI> GOD, <HI>&s;hould &s;hine into them,</HI> And, v. 6. <HI>For</HI> GOD, <HI>who commanded the Light to &s;hine out of Darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of</HI> GOD, <HI>in the Face of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. 'Tis
<PB N="36" REF="006996_0036_102AE0386AA2F678" MS="y">
very evident that a &s;aving Belief of the Go&s;pel, is here &s;poken of by the Apo&s;tle, as ari&s;ing from a View of the divine Glory or Beauty of the Things it exhibits. 'Tis by this View, that the Soul of a true Convert is enabled &s;avingly, to &s;ee the Suffi|cency of CHRIST for his Salvation. He that has his Eyes open'd to behold the divine &s;uperlative Beauty and Loveline&s;s of JESUS CHRIST, is convinced of his Sufficiency, to &s;tand as a Medator between Him, a guilty Hell-de&s;erving Wretch, and an infinitely holy GOD, in an exceeding different Manner than ever he can be convinced by all the Arguments that are made U&s;e of, by the excellent Authors or Preachers.</P>
<P>When he once comes to &s;ee CHRIST's divine Loveline&s;s, he wonders no more that he is thought worthy by GOD the Fa|ther, to be accepted for the vile&s;t Sinner. Now it is not dif|ficult for him to conceive, how the Blood of CHRIST &s;hould be e&s;teem'd by GOD &s;o precious, as to be worthy to be ac|cepted as a Compen&s;ation for the greate&s;t Sins. The Soul now properly &s;ees the Preciou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, and &s;o does properly &s;ee and under&s;tand the very Ground and Rea&s;on of his Acceptablene&s;s to GOD, and the Value GOD &s;ets on his Blood, Obedience and Interce&s;&s;ion. This &s;atisfies the poor guilty Soul, and gives it Re&s;t; when the fine&s;t and mo&s;t elaborate Di&s;cour&s;es, about the Sufficency of CHRIST, and Suitablene&s;s of the Way of Salvation, would not do it. When a Man then comes to &s;ee the proper Foundation of Faith and Affiance, with his own Eyes, then he believes &s;avingly. <HI>He that &s;eeth the Son, and believeth on Him, hath everla&s;ting Life.</HI> John. vi. 40. when CHRIST thus <HI>MANIFESTS GOD's NAME</HI> to Men, then <HI>they believe that all Things what&s;oever</HI> GOD <HI>has given to</HI> CHRIST <HI>are of him, and be|lieves that</HI> CHRIST <HI>was &s;ent of</HI> GOD. John xvii. 6, 7, 8. And <HI>they that thus know</HI> CHRIST's <HI>Name will tru&s;t in him.</HI> P&s;. ix. 10. In order to true Faith in JESUS CHRIST, the Son of GOD, is REVEAL'D IN MEN. <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 15. 16. And 'tis this Sight of the divine Beauty of CHRIST, that bows the Wills, and draws the Hearts of Men. A Sight of the Greatne&s;s of GOD in his Attributes, may overwhelm Men, and be more than they can endure; but the Enmity and Oppo&s;ition of the Heart, may remain in its full Strength, and
<PB N="37" REF="006996_0037_102AE03B4880A6A8">
the Will remain inflexible; whereas, one Glimp&s;e of the moral and &s;piritual Glory of GOD, and &s;upreme Amiablene&s;s of JESUS CHRIST, &s;hining into the Heart, overcomes and aboli&s;hes this Oppo&s;ition, and inclines the Soul to CHRIST, as it were, by an omnipotent Power: So that now, not only the Un|der&s;tanding, but the Will, and the whole Soul receives and embraces the Saviour. This is mo&s;t certainly the Di&s;co|very, which is the fir&s;t internal Foundation of a &s;aving Faith in CHRIST, in the Soul of the true Convert; and not on having of it immediately &s;ugge&s;ted and revealed to the Soul, by a Text of Scripture, or any immediate outward or in|ward Witne&s;s, that CHRIST loves <HI>him,</HI> or that he died for <HI>him in particular,</HI> and is <HI>his</HI> Saviour; &s;o begetting Confi|dence and Joy, and a &s;eeming Love to CHRIST, becau&s;e he loves Him: By which &s;ort of Faith and Conver&s;ion, (de|mon&s;trably vain and counterfeit) Multitudes have been de|luded. The Sight of the Glory of GOD, in the Face of JESUS CHRIST, works true &s;upreme Love to GOD: This is a Sight of the proper Foundation of &s;upreme Love to GOD, <HI>viz.</HI> The &s;upreme Loveline&s;s of his Nature; and a Love to him on this Ground, is truly above any Thing that can come from a meer Principle of Self-love, which is in the Hearts of Devils, as well as Men. And this begets true &s;piritual and holy Joy in the Soul, which is indeed Joy in GOD, and glorying in him, and not rejoycing in our&s;elves.</P>
<P>This Sight of the Beauty of divine Things, will excite true De&s;ires and Longings of Soul, after tho&s;e Things; not like the Longings of Devils, or any &s;uch forced De&s;ires, as tho&s;e of a Man in great Danger of Death, after &s;ome bitter Medi|cine, that he hopes will &s;ave his Life; but natural free De&s;ires, the De&s;ires of Appetite; the Thir&s;tings of a new Nature; as a new-born Babe de&s;ires the Mother's Brea&s;t; and as a hungry Man longs for &s;ome plea&s;ant Food he thinks of; or as the thir&s;ty Hart pants after the cool and clear Stream.</P>
<P>This Sen&s;e of divine Beauty, is the fir&s;t Thing in the actual Change made in the Soul, in true Conver&s;ion, and is the Foundation of every Thing el&s;e belonging to that Change; as is evident by tho&s;e Words of the Apo&s;tle, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 18. <HI>But we all with open Face, beholding as in a Gla&s;s, the
<PB N="38" REF="006996_0038_102AE03CD2E6B308">
Glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Truly gracious Affections and Exerci&s;es of Mind dif|fer from &s;uch as are counterfeit, which ari&s;e from no higher Principles than are in the Hearts of Devils, in their Tenden|cy: And that in the&s;e two Re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) They are of a Tendency and Influence very con|trary to that, which was e&s;pecially the Devil's Sin, even Pride. That Pride was in a peculiar Manner the Devil's Sin, is manife&s;t from 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 6. <HI>Not a Novice left, being lifted up with Pride, he fell into the Condemnation of the Devil.</HI> Fal&s;e and delu&s;ive Experiences evermore tend to this; tho' oftentimes under the Di&s;gui&s;e of great and extra|ordinary Humility. Spiritual Pride, is the prevailing Tem|per, and general Character of Hypocrites, deluded with fal&s;e Di&s;coveries and Affections. They are in general, of a Di&s;po&s;ition directly contrary to tho&s;e two Things belonging to the Chri&s;tian Temper, directed to by the Apo&s;tle; the One in <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 16. <HI>Be not wi&s;e in your own Conceit;</HI> and the other in <HI>Philip.</HI> ii. 3. <HI>Let each e&s;teem others better than them&s;elves.</HI> Fal&s;e Experience is conceited of it&s;elf, and af|fected with it&s;elf. Thus he that has fal&s;e Humility, is much affected to think, how he is aba&s;ed before GOD: He that has fal&s;e Love, is affected, when he thinks of the Greatne&s;s of his Love. The very Food and Nouri&s;hment of fal&s;e Ex|perience, is to view it&s;elf, and take much Notice of it&s;elf; and it's very Breath and Life is to talk much of it&s;elf, or &s;ome Way to be &s;hewing it &s;elf. Whereas truly gracious Views and Affections, are of a quite contrary Tendency: They nouri&s;h no Self-Conceit; no exalting Conceit of the Man's own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Experience, or Privileges; no high Conceit of his Humiliations. They incline to no Often|tation, nor Self-Exaltation, under any Di&s;gui&s;e what&s;oever. But that Sen&s;e of the &s;upreme, holy Beauty and Glory of GOD and CHRIST, which is the Foundation of them, and that only, mortifies Pride, and truly humbles the Soul. It not only cuts off &s;ome of the outermo&s;t Branches (cau&s;ing many Branches to grow out, where but one was before) but it &s;trikes at the very Root of Pride; it alters the very Na|ture
<PB N="39" REF="006996_0039_102AE03E70137308">
and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Heart. The Light of GOD's Beauty, and that alone truly &s;hews the Soul its own Defor|mity, and effectually inclines it to exalt GOD, and aba&s;e it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The&s;e gracious Exerci&s;es and Affections, differ from the other in their Tendency, to de&s;troy Satan's Intere&s;t. 1<HI>&s;t</HI> In the Per&s;on him&s;elf, in their Tendency, to cau&s;e the Soul to <HI>hate every Evil, and fal&s;e Way,</HI> and to produce univer&s;al Holine&s;s of Heart and Life; di&s;po&s;ing him to make the Ser|vice of GOD, and the promoting his Glory, and the Good of Mankind, the very Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life. Whereas tho&s;e fal&s;e Di&s;coveries and Affections, have not this Effect. There may indeed, be great Zeal, and a great deal of what is called Religion; but it is not a truly Chri&s;tian Zeal; 'tis not a being zealous of good Works: Their Religion is not the Service of GOD; 'tis not a &s;eeking and &s;erving GOD; but indeed, a &s;eeking and &s;erving them&s;elves. Tho' there may be a Change of Life, 'tis not a Change from every wicked Way, to a uniform Chri&s;tian Life and Practice; but only a turning the Stream of Corruption from one Channel to another. Thus the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hes, in our Context, a true Faith, from the Faith of Devils: James ii. 19, 20. <HI>Thou believe&s;t there is one</HI> GOD. <HI>The Devils al&s;o believe and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain Man, that Faith without Works is dead?</HI> And thus the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hes true Communion with GOD. 1 John, i. 6, 7. <HI>If we &s;ay that we have Fellow&s;hip with Him, and walk in Darkne&s;s, we lie, and do not the Truth. But if we walk in the Light, or he is in the Light, we have Fel|low&s;hip one with another, and the Blood of</HI> CHRIST <HI>clean&s;eth us from all Sin.</HI> By this he di&s;tingui&s;hes true &s;piritual Know|ledge, Chap. ii. 3, 4. <HI>Hereby we do know, that we know Him, that we keep his Commandments. He that &s;aith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Liar, and the Truth is not in him.</HI> And hereby the &s;ame Apo&s;tle di&s;tingui|&s;hes true Love. Chap. iii. 18, 19. <HI>Let us not love in Word and in Tongue, but in Deed,</HI> [<HI>in Work,</HI> as the Word &s;igni|fies] and in Truth. <HI>And hereby we know that we are of the Truth, and &s;hall a&s;&s;ure our Hearts before him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Truly gracious Experiences, have a Tendency to de|&s;troy Satan's Intere&s;t in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="006996_0040_102AE040439E48E8">
Fal&s;e Religion, con&s;i&s;ting in the Counterfeits of the Ope|rations of the Spirit of GOD, and in high <HI>Pretences</HI> and great <HI>Appearances</HI> of inward experimental Religion; when this prevails among a People, tho' for the pre&s;ent it may &s;urprize many, and may be the Occa&s;ion of alarming and awaken|ing &s;ome Sinners; yet in the final I&s;&s;ue of Things, tends greatly to wound and weaken the Cau&s;e of vital Religion, and to &s;trengthen the Intere&s;t of Satan, de&s;perately to harden the Hearts of Sinners, exceedingly to fill the World with Prejudice, again&s;t the Power of Godline&s;s, to promote In|fidelity, and licentious Principles and Practices, to build up, and make &s;trong the Devil's Kingdom in the World, more than open Vice and Profanene&s;s, or profe&s;&s;ed Athei&s;m, or publick Per&s;ecution; and perhaps, more than any Thing el&s;e what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;o with true Religion, in it's genuine Beauty. That, if it prevails in great Power, will doubtle&s;s, excite the Rage of the Devil, and many other Enemies of Religion: However, it gives great Advantage to it's Friends, and ex|ceedingly &s;trengthens their Cau&s;e; and tends to convince or confound Enemies. True Religion, is a divine Light in the Souls of the Saints; and as it &s;hines out in the Conver&s;ation before Men, it tends to induce others to glorify GOD. There is Nothing like it, (as to Means) to awaken the Con&s;ciences of Men, to convince Infidels, and to &s;top the Mouths of Gain&s;ayers. Tho' Men naturally hate the Power of Godli|ne&s;s; yet, when they &s;ee the Fruits of it, there is a Witne&s;s in their Con&s;ciences in its Favour. <HI>He that &s;erveth</HI> CHRIST <HI>in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, is acceptable to</HI> GOD, <HI>and approved of Man.</HI> Rom. xiv. 17, 18.

Hereby the Saints are <HI>fill'd with all the Fullne&s;s of GOD;</HI> Eph. iii. 18, 19. Hereby they <HI>have Fellow&s;hip with, both the Father and the Son,</HI> (1 John i. 3.) that is, they communicate with them in their Happi|ne&s;s. Yea, by Means of this divine Virtue, there is a mutual Indwelling of GOD and the Saints; 1 John, iv. 16. GOD <HI>is Love; and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in</HI> GOD, <HI>and</HI> GOD <HI>in him.</HI></P>
<P>This Qualification mu&s;t render the Per&s;on that has it, ex|cellent and happy indeed; and doubtle&s;s, is the highe&s;t Dig|nity, and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of any Creature. This is the peculiar Gift of GOD, which he be&s;tows only on his &s;pecial Favourites. As to Silver, Gold, and Diamonds, earthly Crowns and Kingdoms, He often throws 'em out to tho&s;e that he e&s;teems as Dogs and Swine; but this is the peculiar Ble&s;&s;ing of his dear Children: This is what Fle&s;h and Blood can't impart, and what all the Devils in Hell, can't work the lea&s;t Degree of in any Heart; 'tis GOD alone can be&s;tow it. This was the &s;pecial Benefit, which CHRIST died to procure for his Elect, the mo&s;t excellent Token of his everla&s;ting Love; the chief Fruit of his great Labours, and the mo&s;t precious Purcha&s;e of his Blood.</P>
<P>By this, above all other Things, do Men glorify GOD. By this, above all other Things, do the Saints &s;hine as Lights in the World, and are Ble&s;&s;ings to Mankind. And this, above all Things, tends to their own Comfort; from hence ari&s;es that <HI>Peace with pa&s;&s;eth all Under&s;tanding,</HI> and
<PB N="42" REF="006996_0042_102AE044DE9FB0F0">
that <HI>Joy, which is un&s;peakable, and full of Glory.</HI> And this is that which will mo&s;t certainly i&s;&s;ue in the eternal Salvation of tho&s;e that have it: 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, that the Soul, wherein it is, &s;hould &s;ink and peri&s;h: 'Tis an immortal Seed; 'tis eternal Life begun; and therefore, they that have it, <HI>can never die.</HI> 'Tis the Dawning of the Light of Glory. 'Tis <HI>the Day-Star ri&s;en in the Heart,</HI> that is a &s;ure Fore-runner of that Suns ri&s;ing, which will bring on an everla&s;ting Day. This is that <HI>Water, which</HI> CHRIST <HI>gives, which is in him that drink's it, a Well of Water, &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting Life:</HI> John iv. 14. 'Tis &s;omething from Heaven, is of a heavenly Nature, and tends to Heaven. And tho&s;e that have it, however they may now Wander in a Wilderne&s;s, or be to&s;&s;ed to and fro, on a tempe&s;tuous Ocean, &s;hall certainly arrive in Heaven at la&s;t, where this heavenly Spark &s;hall be increa&s;ed, and perfected, and the Souls of the Saints, all be transformed into a bright and pure Flame, and they &s;hall &s;hine forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father.</P>

Though they dig into Hell, thence &s;hall mine Hand take them; though they climb up to Heaven, thence will I bring them down.

<HEAD>SINNERS In the Hands of an angry GOD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>DEUT. XXXII. 35.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;Their Foot &s;hall &s;lide in due Time.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN this Ver&s;e is threatned the Vengeance of GOD, on the wicked unbelieving I&s;raelites, that were GOD's vi&s;ible People, and lived under Means of Grace; and that, notwith&s;tanding all GOD's wonderful Works, that he had wrought to|wards that People, yet remained, as is expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. void of Coun&s;el, having no Under&s;tanding in them; and that, under all the Cultivations of Heaven, brought forth bitter and poi&s;onous Fruit; as in the two Ver&s;es next preceeding the Text.</P>
<P>The Expre&s;&s;ion that I have cho&s;en for my Text, <HI>Their Foot &s;hall &s;lide in due Time;</HI> &s;eems to imply the following Things, relating to the Puni&s;hment and Di&s;truction that the&s;e wicked I&s;raelites were expo&s;ed to.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they were <HI>always</HI> expo&s;ed to De&s;truction; as one that &s;tands or walks in &s;lippery Places, is always expo&s;ed to fall. This is implied in the Manner of their De&s;truction's coming upon them, being repre&s;ented by their Foot's &s;liding&punc; the &s;ame is expre&s;s'd, P&s;al. lxxiii. 18. <HI>Surely thou did&s;t &s;et them in &s;lippery Places; thou ca&s;ted&s;t them down into De&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It implies that they were always expo&s;ed to <HI>&s;udden</HI> un|expected De&s;truction. As he that walks in &s;lippery Places is every Moment liable to fall; he can't fore&s;ee one Moment whether he &s;hall &s;tand or fall the next; and when he does fall, he falls at once, without Warning. Which is al&s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ed in that P&s;al. lxxiii. 18, 19. <HI>Surely thou did&s;t &s;et them in &s;lippery Places; thou ca&s;ted&s;t them down into De|&s;truction. How are they brought into De&s;olation as in a Moment?</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="46" REF="006996_0045_102AE04C06D47190">
3. Another Thing implied is, that they are liable to fall <HI>of them&s;elves,</HI> without being thrown down by the Hand of ano|ther. As he that &s;tands or walks on &s;lippery Ground, needs nothing but his own Weight to throw him down.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Rea&s;on why they are not fallen already, and don't fall now, is only that GOD's appointed Time is not come. For it is &s;aid, that when that due Time, or appoin|ted Time comes, <HI>their Foot &s;hall &s;lide.</HI> Then they &s;hall be left to fall, as they are inclined by their own Weight. GOD won't hold them up in the&s;e &s;lippery Places any longer, but will let them go; and then, at that very In&s;tant, they &s;hall fall into De&s;truction; as he that &s;tands in &s;uch &s;lippery de|clining Ground on the Edge of a Pit that he can't &s;tand alone, when he is let go, he immediately falls and is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervation from the Words that I would now in&s;i&s;t upon, is this,
<Q>There is Nothing that keeps wicked Men, at any one Mo|ment, out of Hell, but the meer Plea&s;ure of GOD.</Q></P>
<P>By the meer Plea&s;ure of GOD, I mean his &s;overeign Plea|&s;ure, his arbitrary Will, re&s;trained by no Obligation, hin|der'd by no Manner of Difficulty, any more than if nothing el&s;e but GOD's meer Will had in the lea&s;t Degree, or in any Re&s;pect what&s;oever, any Hand in the Pre&s;ervation of wicked Men one Moment.</P>
<P>The Truth of this Ob&s;ervation may appear by the fol|lowing Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is no Want of <HI>Power</HI> in GOD to ca&s;t wicked Men into Hell at any Moment. Men's Hands can't be &s;trong when GOD ri&s;es up: The &s;tronge&s;t have no Power to re&s;i&s;t him, nor can any deliver out of his Hands.</P>
<P>He is not only able to ca&s;t wicked Men into Hell, but he can mo&s;t <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> do it. Sometimes an earthly Prince meets with a great deal of Difficulty to &s;ubdue a Rebel, that has found Means to fortify him&s;elf, and has made him&s;elf &s;trong by the Numbers of his Followers. But it is not &s;o with GOD. There is no Fortre&s;s that is any Defence from the Power of GOD. Tho' Hand join in Hand, and va&s;t Multitudes of GOD's Enemies combine and a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves, they are ea&s;ily broken in Pieces: They are as great Heaps of light
<PB N="47" REF="006996_0046_102AE04D93AEBDF8">
Chaff before the Whirlwind; or large Quantities of dry Stubble before devouring Flames. We find it ea&s;y to tread on, and cru&s;h a Worm, that we &s;ee crawling on the Earth; &s;o 'tis ea&s;y for us to cut or &s;inge a &s;lender Thread that any Things hangs by; thus ea&s;y is it for GOD, when he plea&s;es, to ca&s;t his Enemies down to Hell. What are we, that we &s;hould think to &s;tand before him, at who&s;e Rebuke the Earth trembles, and before whom the Rocks are thrown down?</P>
<P N="2">2. They <HI>de&s;erve</HI> to be ca&s;t into Hell; &s;o that divine Ju|&s;tice never &s;tands in the Way, it makes no Objection again&s;t GOD's u&s;ing his Power at any Moment to de&s;troy them. Yea, on the contrary, Ju&s;tice calls aloud for an infinite Puni&s;hment of their Sins. Divine Ju&s;tice, &s;ays of the Tree that brings forth &s;uch Grapes of Sodom, <HI>Cut it down, why cumbreth it the Ground,</HI> Luk. xiii. 7. The Sword of divine Ju&s;tice is every Moment brandi&s;hed over their Heads, and 'tis nothing but the Hand of arbitrary Mercy, and GOD's meer Will, that holds it back.</P>
<P N="3">3. They are <HI>already</HI> under a Sentence of Condemnation to Hell. They don't only ju&s;tly de&s;erve to be ca&s;t down thi|ther; but the Sentence of the Law of GOD, that eternal and immutable Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that GOD has fixed between him and Mankind, is gone out again&s;t them, and &s;tands again&s;t them; &s;o that they are bound over already to Hell. John iii. 18. <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already.</HI> So that every unconverted Man properly belongs to Hell; that is his Place; from thence he is. John viii. 23. <HI>Ye are from beneath:</HI> And thither he is bound; 'tis the Place that Ju|&s;tice, and GOD's Word, and the Sentence of his unchange|able Law a&s;&s;igns to him.</P>
<P N="4">4. They are now the Objects of that very <HI>&s;ame</HI> Anger and Wrath of GOD, that is expre&s;&s;ed in the Torments of Hell&punc; And the Rea&s;on why they don't go down to Hell at each Moment, is not becau&s;e GOD, in who&s;e Power they are, is not then very angry with them; as angry as he is with many of tho&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures, that he is now tormenting in Hell, and do there feel and bear the Fiercene&s;s of his Wrath. Yea, GOD is a great deal more angry with great Numbers that are now on Earth; yea, doubtle&s;s, with many that are
<PB N="48" REF="006996_0047_102AE04F38A59640">
now in this Congregation, that it may be, are at Ea&s;e and Quiet, than he is with many of tho&s;e that are now in the Flames of Hell.</P>
<P>So that it is not becau&s;e GOD is unmindful of their Wick|edne&s;s, and don't re&s;ent it, that he don't let loo&s;e his Hand and cut them off. GOD is not altogether &s;uch an One as them&s;elves, tho' they may imagine him to be &s;o. The Wrath of GOD burns again&s;t them, their Damnation don't &s;lumber, the Pit is prepared, the Fire is made ready, the Furnace is now hot, ready to receive them; the Flames do now rage and glow. The glittering Sword is whet, and held over them, and the Pit hath opened her Mouth under them.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Devil</HI> &s;tands ready to fall upon them, and &s;eize them as his own, at what Moment GOD &s;hall permit him. They belong to him; he has their Souls in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and under his Dominion. The Scripture repre&s;ents them as his <HI>Goods,</HI> Luk. xi. 12. The Devils watch them; they are ever by them, at their right Hand; they &s;tand waiting for them, like greedy hungry Lions that &s;ee their Prey, and expect to have it, but are for the Pre&s;ent kept back; if GOD &s;hould withdraw his Hand, by which they are re&s;trained, they would in one Moment fly upon their poor Souls. The old Serpent is gaping for them; Hell opens its Mouth wide to receive them; and if God &s;hould permit it, they would be ha&s;tily &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. There are in the Souls of wicked Men, tho&s;e helli&s;h <HI>Principles</HI> reigning, that would pre&s;ently kindle and flame out into Hell Fire, if it were not for GOD's Re&s;traints. There is laid in the very Nature of carnal Men, a Foundation for the Torments of Hell: There are tho&s;e currupt Principles, in reigning Power in them, and in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, that are Seeds of Hell Fire. The&s;e Principles are active and powerful, exceeding violent in their Nature, and if it were not for the re&s;training Hand of GOD upon them, they would &s;oon break out, they would flame out after the &s;ame Manner as the &s;ame Corruptions, the &s;ame Enmity does in the Hearts of damned Souls, and would beget the &s;ame Torments in 'em as they do in them. The Souls of the Wicked, are in Scripture compared to the troubled Sea, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> lvii. 20. For
<PB N="49" REF="006996_0048_102AE0512F926BC8">
the pre&s;ent GOD re&s;trains their Wickedne&s;s by his mighty Power, as he does the raging Waves of the troubled Sea, &s;aying, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, and no further;</HI> but if GOD &s;hould withdraw that re&s;training Power, it would &s;oon carry all afore it. Sin is the Ruin and Mi&s;ery of the Soul; it is de&s;tructive in it's Nature; and if GOD &s;hould leave it without Re&s;traint, there would need nothing el&s;e to make the Soul perfectly mi&s;erable. The Corruption of the Heart of Man is a Thing that is immoderate and boundle&s;s in its Fury; and while wicked Men live here, it is like Fire pent up by GOD's Re&s;traints, whenas if it were let loo&s;e, it would &s;et on Fire the Cour&s;e of Nature; and as the Heart is now a Sink of Sin, &s;o, if Sin was not re&s;train'd, it would imme|diately turn the Soul into a fiery Oven, or a Furnace of Fire and Brim&s;tone.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is no Security to wicked Men for one Moment, that there are no <HI>vi&s;ible Means</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> at Hand. 'Tis no Security to a natural Man, that he is now in Health, and that he don't &s;ee which Way he &s;hould now immediately go out of the World by any Accident, and that there is no vi|&s;ible Danger in any Re&s;pect in his Circum&s;tances. The ma|nifold and continual Experience of the World in all Ages, &s;hews that this is no Evidence that a Man is not on the very Brink of Eternity, and that the next Step won't be into another World. The un&s;een, unthought-of Ways and Means of Per&s;ons going &s;uddenly out of the World are innumerable and inconceivable. Unconverted Men walk over the Pit of Hell on a rotten Covering, and there are innumerable Places in this Covering &s;o weak that they won't bear their Weight, and the&s;e Places are not &s;een. The Ar|rows of Death fly un&s;een at Noon-Day; the &s;harpe&s;t Sight can't di&s;cern them&punc; GOD has &s;o many different un|&s;earchable Ways of taking Wicked Men out of the World and &s;ending 'em to Hell, that there is nothing to make it ap|pear, that GOD had need to be at the Expence of a Miracle, or go out of the ordinary Cour&s;e of his Providence, to de|&s;troy any wicked Man, at any Moment. All the Means that there are of Sinners going out of the World, are &s;o in GOD's Hands, and &s;o univer&s;ally ab&s;olutely &s;ubject to his Power
<PB N="50" REF="006996_0049_102AE0541652F358">
and Determination, that it don't depend at all le&s;s on the meer Will of GOD, whether Sinners &s;hall at any Moment go to Hell, than if Means were never made u&s;e of, or at all concerned in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="8">8. Natural Men's <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Care</HI> to pre&s;erve their own <HI>Lives,</HI> or the Care of others to pre&s;erve them, don't &s;ecure 'em a Moment. This divine Providence and uni|ver&s;al Experience does al&s;o bear Te&s;timony to. There is this clear Evidence that Men's own Wi&s;dom is no Security to them from Death; That if it were otherwi&s;e we &s;hould &s;ee &s;ome Difference between the wi&s;e and politick Men of the World, and others, with Regard to their Liablene&s;s to early and unexpected Death; but how is it in Fact? Ecle&s;. 2. 16. <HI>How dieth the wi&s;e Man? as the Fool.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. All wicked Men's <HI>Pains</HI> and <HI>Contrivance</HI> they u&s;e to e&s;cape <HI>Hell,</HI> while they continue to reject CHRIST, and &s;o re|main wicked Men, don't &s;ecure 'em from Hell one Moment. Almo&s;t every natural Man that hears of Hell, flatters him|&s;elf that he &s;hall e&s;cape it; he depends upon him&s;elf for his own Security; he flatters him&s;elf in what he has done, and in what he is now doing, or what he intends to do; every one lays out Matters in his own Mind how he &s;hall avoid Damnation, and flatters him&s;elf that he contrives well for him&s;elf, and that his Schemes won't fail. They hear indeed that there are but few &s;aved, and that the bigger Part of Men that have died heretofore are gone to Hell; but each one imagines that he lays out Matters better for his own E&s;cape than others have done: He don't intend to come to that Place of Torment; he &s;ays within him&s;elf, that he intends to take Care that &s;hall be effectual, and to order Matters &s;o for him&s;elf as not to fail.</P>
<P>But the fooli&s;h Children of Men do mi&s;erably delude them&s;elves in their own Schemes, and in their Confidence in their own Strength and Wi&s;dom; they tru&s;t to nothing but a Shadow. The bigger Part of tho&s;e that heretofore have lived under the &s;ame Means of Grace, and are now dead, are undoubtedly gone to Hell; and it was not becau&s;e they were not as wi&s;e as tho&s;e that are now alive; it was not becau&s;e they did not lay out Matters as well for them&s;elves to
<PB N="51" REF="006996_0050_102AE055A53C8820">
&s;ecure their own E&s;cape. If it were &s;o, that we could come to &s;peak with them, and could enquire of them, one by one, whether they expected when alive, and when they u&s;ed to hear about Hell, ever to be the Subjects of that Mi|&s;ery, we doubtle&s;s &s;hould hear one and another reply, No, I never intended to come here; I had laid out Matters otherwi&s;e in my Mind; I thought I &s;hould contrive well for my &s;elf; I thought my Scheme good; I intended to take effectual Care; but it came upon me unexpected; I did not look for it at that Time, and in that Manner; it came as a Thief; Death outwitted me; GOD's Wrath was too quick for me; O my cur&s;ed Fooli&s;hne&s;s! I was flattering my&s;elf, and plea&s;ing my&s;elf with vain Dreams of what I would do hereafter, and when I was &s;aying Peace and Safety, then &s;udden De&s;truction came upon me.</P>
<P N="10">10. GOD has laid him&s;elf under <HI>no Obligation,</HI> by any Promi&s;e, to keep any natural Man out of Hell one Moment. GOD certainly has made no Promi&s;es either of eternal Life, or of any Deliverance or Pre&s;ervation from eternal Death, but what are contained in the Covenant of Grace, the Pro|mi&s;es that are given in CHRIST, in whom all the Promi&s;es are Yea and Amen. But &s;urely they have no Intere&s;t in the Promi&s;es of the Covenant of Grace, that are not the Chil|dren of the Covenant, and that don't believe in any of the Promi&s;es of the Covenant, and have no Intere&s;t in the <HI>Medi|ator</HI> of the Covenant.</P>
<P>So that whatever &s;ome have imagined and pretended a|bout Promi&s;es made to natural Men's earne&s;t &s;eeking and knocking, 'tis plain and manife&s;t, that whatever Pains a na|tural Man takes in Religion, whatever Prayers he makes, till he believes in CHRIST, GOD is under no manner of Ob|ligation to keep him a <HI>Moment</HI> from eternal De&s;truction.</P>
<P>So that thus it is, that natural Men are held in the Hand of GOD over the Pit of Hell; they have de&s;erved the fiery Pit, and are already &s;entenced to it; and GOD is dreadfully provoked, his Anger is as great towards them as to tho&s;e that are actually &s;uffering the Executions of the Fiercene&s;s of his Wrath in Hell, and they have done nothing in the
<PB N="52" REF="006996_0051_102AE057320705A8">
lea&s;t, to appea&s;e or abate that Anger, neither is GOD in the lea&s;t bound by any Promi&s;e to hold 'em up one Moment; the Devil is waiting for them, Hell is gaping for them, the Flames gather and fla&s;h about them, and would fain lay hold on them, and &s;wallow them up; the Fire pent up in their own Hearts is &s;truggling to break out; and they have no Intere&s;t in any Mediator, there are no Means within Reach that can be any Security to them. In &s;hort, they have no Refuge, nothing to take hold of, all that pre&s;erves them every Moment is the meer arbitrary Will, and uncove|nanted unobliged Forbearance of an incen&s;ed GOD.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>The USE may be of <HI>Awakening</HI> to unconverted Per&s;ons in this Congregation. This that you have heard is the Ca&s;e of every one of you that are out of Chri&s;t. That World of Mi&s;ery, that Lake of burning Brim&s;tone is extended a|broad under you. <HI>There</HI> is the dreadful Pit of the glowing Flames of the Wrath of GOD; there is Hell's wide gaping Mouth open; and you have nothing to &s;tand upon, nor any Thing to take hold of: there is nothing between you and Hell but the Air; 'tis only the Power and meer Plea&s;ure of GOD that holds you up.</P>
<P>You probably are not &s;en&s;ible of this; you find you are kept out of Hell, but don't &s;ee the Hand of GOD in it, but look at other Things, as the good State of your bodily Con&s;titution, your Care of your own Life, and the Means you u&s;e for your own Pre&s;ervation. But indeed the&s;e Things are nothing; if GOD &s;hould withdraw his Hand, they would avail no more to keep you from falling, than the thin Air to hold up a Per&s;on that is &s;u&s;pended in it.</P>
<P>Your Wickedne&s;s makes you as it were heavy as Load, and to tend downwards with great Weight and Pre&s;&s;ure to|wards Hell; and if GOD &s;hould let you go, you would im|mediately &s;ink and &s;wiftly de&s;cend and plunge into the bot|tomle&s;s Gulf, and your healthy Con&s;titution, and your own Care and Prudence, and be&s;t Contrivance, and all your Righteou&s;ne&s;s, would have no more Influence to uphold you and keep you out of Hell, then a Spider's Web would have to &s;top a falling Rock. Were it not, that &s;o is the
<PB N="53" REF="006996_0052_102AE0592EF4D7F0">
&s;overeign Plea&s;ure of GOD, the Earth would not bear you one Moment; for you are a Burden to it; the Creation groans with you; the Creature is made &s;ubject to the Bondage of your Corruption, not willingly; the Sun don't willingly &s;hine upon you to give you Light to &s;erve Sin and Satan; the Earth don't willingly yield her Increa&s;e to &s;atisfy your Lu&s;ts; nor is it willingly a Stage for your Wickedne&s;s to be acted upon; the Air don't willingly &s;erve you for Breath to main|tain the Flame of Life in your Vitals, while you &s;pend your Life in the Service of GOD's Enemies. GOD's Creatures are good, and were made for Men to &s;erve GOD with, and don't willingly &s;ub&s;erve to any other Purpo&s;e, and groan when they are abu&s;ed to Purpo&s;es &s;o directly contrary to their Nature and End. And the World would &s;pue you out, were it not for the &s;overeign Hand of him who hath &s;ubjected it in Hope. There are the black Clouds of GOD's Wrath now hanging directly over your Heads, full of the dreadful Storm, and big with Thunder; and were it not for the re&s;training Hand of GOD, it would immediately bur&s;t forth upon you. The &s;overeign Plea&s;ure of GOD, for the pre&s;ent, &s;tays his rough Wind; otherwi&s;e it would come with Fury, and your De&s;truction would come like a Whirlwind, and you would be like the Chaff of the Summer thre&s;hing Floor.</P>
<P>The Wrath of GOD is like great Waters that are dammed for the Pre&s;ent; they increa&s;e more and more, and ri&s;e higher and higher, till an Outlet is given, and the longer the Stream is &s;top'd, the more rapid and mighty is it's Cour&s;e, when once it is let loo&s;e. 'Tis true, that Judgment again&s;t your evil Works, has not been executed hitherto; the Floods of GOD's Vengeance have been with-held; but your Guilt in the mean Time is con&s;tantly increa&s;ing, and you are every Day trea&s;uring up more Wrath; the Waters are continually ri&s;ing, and waxing more and more mighty; and there is Nothing but the meer Plea&s;ure of GOD, that holds the Wa|ters back, that are unwilling to be &s;topped, and pre&s;s hard to go forward; if GOD &s;hould only withdraw his Hand from the Flood-Gate, it would immediately fly open, and the fiery Floods of the Fiercene&s;s and Wrath of GOD, would ru&s;h forth with inconceivable Fury, and would come upon

<P>The Bow of GOD's Wrath is bent, and the Arrow made ready on the String, and Ju&s;tice bends the Arrow at your Heart, and &s;trains the Bow, and it is Nothing but the meer Plea&s;ure of GOD, and that of an angry GOD, without any Promi&s;e or Obligation at all, that keeps the Arrow one Mo|ment from being made drunk with your Blood.</P>
<P>Thus are all you that never pa&s;&s;ed under a great Change of Heart, by the mighty Power of the SPIRIT of GOD upon your Souls; all that were never born again, and made new Creatures, and rai&s;ed from being dead in Sin, to a State of new, and before altogether unexperienced Light and Life, (however you may have reformed your Life in many Things, and may have had religious Affections, and may keep up a Form of Religion in your Families and Clo|&s;ets, and in the Hou&s;es of GOD, and may be &s;trict in it,) you are thus in the Hands of an angry GOD; 'tis Nothing but his meer Plea&s;ure, that keeps you from being this Moment &s;wal|lowed up in everla&s;ting De&s;truction.</P>
<P>However unconvinced you may now be of the Truth of what you hear, by and by you will be fully convinced of it. Tho&s;e that are gone from being in the like Circum&s;tances with you, &s;ee that it was &s;o with them; for De&s;truction came &s;ud|denly upon mo&s;t of them, when they expected Nothing of it, and while they were &s;aying, <HI>Peace and Safety:</HI> Now they &s;ee, that tho&s;e Things that they depended on for Peace and Safety, were Nothing but thin Air and empty Shadows.</P>
<P>The GOD that holds you over the Pit of Hell, much as one holds a Spider, or &s;ome loath&s;ome Infect, over the Fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked; his Wrath towards you burns like Fire; he looks upon you as worthy of Noth|ing el&s;e, but to be ca&s;t into the Fire; he is of purer Eyes than to bear to have you in his Sight; you are ten thou&s;and Times &s;o abominable in his Eyes, as the mo&s;t hateful veno|mous Serpent is in ours.

'tis Nothing but his Hand that holds you from falling into the Fire every Moment: 'Tis to be a&s;cribed to Nothing el&s;e, that you did not go to Hell the la&s;t Night; that you was &s;uffer'd to awake again in this World, after you clo&s;ed your Eyes to &s;leep: And there is no other Rea&s;on to be given, why you have not dropped into Hell &s;ince you aro&s;e in the Morning, but that GOD's Hand has held you up: There is no other Rea&s;on to be given why you han't gone to Hell, &s;ince you have &s;at here in the Hou&s;e of GOD, provok|ing his pure Eyes by your &s;inful wicked Manner of attending his &s;olemn Wor&s;hip: Yea, there is Nothing el&s;e that is to be given as a Rea&s;on why you don't this very Moment drop down into Hell.</P>
<P>O Sinner!

<P N="1">1. <HI>Who&s;e</HI> Wrath it is: It is the Wrath of the infinite GOD. If it were only the Wrath of Man, tho' it were of the mo&s;t potent Prince, it would be comparatively little to be regarded. The Wrath of Kings is very much dreaded, e&s;pecially of ab&s;olute Monarchs, that have the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Lives of their Subjects wholly in their Power, to be di&s;|po&s;ed of at their meer Will. Prov. xx. 2. <HI>The Fear of a King is as the Roaring of a Lion: Who&s;o provoketh him to Anger, &s;inneth again&s;t his own Soul.</HI> The Subject that very much enrages an arbitrary Prince, is liable to &s;uffer the mo&s;t extream Torments, that human Art can invent, or human Power can inflict. But the greate&s;t earthly Potentates, in

their greate&s;t Maje&s;ty and Strength, and when cloathed in their greate&s;t Terrors, are but feeble de&s;picable Worms of the Du&s;t, in Compari&s;on of the great and almighty Creator and King of Heaven and Earth: It is but little that they can do, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m mo&s;t enraged, and when they have exerted the utmo&s;t of their Fury. All the Kings of the Earth before GOD, are is Gra&s;hoppers, they are Nothing, and le&s;s than Nothing: Both their Love and their Hatred is to be de&s;pi&s;ed. The Wrath of the great King of Kings, is as much more terrible than their's, as his Maje&s;ty is greater. Luke xii. 4, 5. <HI>And I &s;ay unto you my Friends, be not afraid of them that kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do: But I will forewarn you whom you &s;hall fear; fear him, which after he hath killed, hath Power to ca&s;t into Hell; yea, I &s;ay un|to you, fear him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis the <HI>Fiercene&s;s</HI> of his Wrath that you are expo&s;ed to. We often read of the <HI>Fury</HI> of GOD; as in I&s;ai. lix. 18. <HI>According to their Deeds, accordingly he will repay Fury to his Adver&s;aries.</HI> So I&s;ai. lxvi, 15. <HI>For behold, the Lord will come with Fire, and with Chariots, like a Whirlwind, to render his Anger with Fury, and his Rebukes with Flames of Fire.</HI> And &s;o in many other Places. So we read of GOD's <HI>Fiercene&s;s.</HI> Rev. xix. 15. There we read of <HI>the Wine-Pre&s;s of the Fiercene&s;s and Wrath of Almighty</HI> GOD. The Words are exceeding terrible. If it had only been &s;aid, <HI>the Wrath of</HI> GOD, the Words would have implied that which is infinitely dreadful: But 'tis not only &s;aid &s;o, but <HI>the Fiercene&s;s and Wrath of</HI> GOD: The Fury of GOD! the Fiercene&s;s of Jeho|vah! Oh how dreadful mu&s;t that be! Who can utter or conceive what &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions carry in them! But it is not only &s;aid &s;o, but <HI>the Fiercene&s;s and Wrath of ALMIGHTY GOD.</HI> As tho' there would be a very great Manife&s;tation of his almighty Power, in what the Fiercene&s;s of his Wrath &s;hould inflict, as tho' Omnipotence &s;hould be as it were en|raged, and exerted, as Men were wont to exert their Strength in the Fiercene&s;s of their Wrath. Oh! then what will be the Con&s;equence! What will become of the poor Worm that &s;hall &s;uffer it! Who&s;e Hands can be &s;trong? And who&s;e Heart endure?

<P>Con&s;ider this, you that are here pre&s;ent, that yet remain in an unregenerate State. That GOD will execute the Fierce|ne&s;s of his Anger, implies, that he will inflict Wrath without any Pity: When GOD beholds the ineffable Extremity of your Ca&s;e, and &s;ees your Torment to be &s;o va&s;tly di&s;pro|portion'd to your Strength, and &s;ees how your poor Soul is cru&s;hed and &s;inks down, as it were into an infinite Gloom; he will have no Compa&s;&s;ion upon you, he will not forbear the Executions of his Wrath, or in the lea&s;t lighten his Hand; there &s;hall be no Moderation or Mercy, nor will GOD then at all &s;tay his rough Wind; he will have no Re|gard to your Welfare, nor be at all careful le&s;t you &s;hould &s;uffer too much, in any other Sen&s;e, than only that you &s;hall not &s;uffer beyond what &s;trict Ju&s;tice requires: Nothing &s;hall be with-held, becau&s;e it's &s;o hard for you to bear. Ezek. viii. 18. <HI>Therefore will I al&s;o deal in Fury; mine Eye &s;hall not &s;pare, neither will I have Pity; and tho' they cry in mine Ears with a loud Voice, yet I will not hear them.</HI> Now GOD &s;tands ready to pity you; this is a Day of Mercy; you may cry now with &s;ome Encouragement of obtaining Mercy: But when once the Day of Mercy is pa&s;t, your mo&s;t lamentable and dolorous Cries and Shrieks will be in vain; you will be wholly lo&s;t and thrown away of GOD as to any Regard to your Welfare; GOD will have no other U&s;e to put you to, but only to &s;uffer Mi&s;ery; you &s;hall be conti|nued in being to no other End; for you will be a Ve&s;&s;el of Wrath fitted to De&s;truction; and there will be no other U&s;e of this Ve&s;&s;el but only to be filled full of Wrath: GOD will be &s;o far from pitying you when you cry to him, that 'tis &s;aid he will only <HI>Laugh and Mock,</HI> Prov. i. 25, 26. &amp;c.</P>
<P>How awful are tho&s;e Words, I&s;ai, lxiii. 3. which are the Words of the great GOD, <HI>I will tread them in mine Anger, and will trample them in my Fury, and their Blood &s;hall be &s;prinkled upon my Garments, and I will &s;tain all my Raiment.</HI> 'Tis perhaps impo&s;&s;ible, to conceive of Words that carry in them greater Manife&s;tations of the&s;e three Things&punc; <HI>viz.</HI> Contempt, and Hatred, and Fiercene&s;s of Indignation.
<PB N="58" REF="006996_0057_102AD25E82949178">
If you cry to GOD to pity you, he will be &s;o far from pity|ing you in your doleful Ca&s;e, or &s;hewing you the lea&s;t Re|gard or Favour, that in&s;tead of that, he'll only tread you under Foot: And tho' he will know, that you can't bear the Weight of Omnipotence treading upon you, yet he won't Regard that, but he will cru&s;h you under his Feet without Mercy; He'll cru&s;h out your Blood, and make it fly, and it &s;hall be &s;prinkled on his Garments, &s;o as to &s;tain all his Raiment.

<P N="3">3. The Mi&s;ery you are expo&s;ed to, is that which GOD will inflict to that End, that he might <HI>&s;hew</HI> what that <HI>Wrath</HI> of JEHOVAH is. GOD hath had it on his Heart to &s;hew to Angels and Men, both how excellent his Love is, and al&s;o how terrible his Wrath is. Sometimes earthly Kings have a Mind to &s;hew how terrible <HI>their</HI> Wrath is, by the extream Puni&s;hments they would execute on tho&s;e that provoke 'em. <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> that mighty and haughty Monarch of the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Empire, was willing to &s;hew <HI>his</HI> Wrath, when en|raged with <HI>Shadrach, Me&s;hech,</HI> and <HI>Abednego;</HI> and accord|ingly gave Order, that the burning fiery Furnace &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;even Times hotter than it was before; doubtle&s;s, it was rai&s;ed to the utmo&s;t Degree of Fiercene&s;s, that humane Art could rai&s;e it: But the great GOD is al&s;o willing to &s;hew <HI>his Wrath,</HI> and magnify his awful Maje&s;ty and mighty Power in the extream Sufferings of his Enemies. Rom. xix. 22. <HI>What if God willing to &s;hew HIS Wrath, and to make his Power known, endured with much Long-&s;uffering, the Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath fitted to De&s;truction?</HI> And &s;eeing this is his De&s;ign and what he has determined, to &s;hew how terrible the unmix|ed, unre&s;trained Wrath, the Fury and Fiercene&s;s of JEHOVAH is, he will do it to Effect. There will be &s;omething accom|pli&s;hed and brought to pa&s;s, that will be dreadful with a Wit|ne&s;s. When the great and angry GOD, hath ri&s;en up and executed his awful Vengeance on the poor Sinner; and the Wretch is actually &s;uffering the infinite Weight and Power of his Indignation, then will GOD call upon the whole Uni|ver&s;e
<PB N="59" REF="006996_0058_102AE065D24039D8">
to behold that awful Maje&s;ty and mighty Power, that is to be &s;een in it.

<P>Thus it will be with you that are in an unconverted State, if you continue in it; the infinite Might, and Maje&s;ty and Terriblene&s;s of the OMNIPOTENT GOD &s;hall be magnified upon you, in the ineffable Strength of your Torments: You &s;hall be tormented in the Pre&s;ence of the holy Angels, and in the Pre&s;ence of the Lamb; and when you &s;hall be in this State of Suffering, the glorious Inhabitants of Heaven &s;hall go forth and look on the awful Spectacle, that they may &s;ee what the Wrath and Fiercene&s;s of the Almighty is, and when they have &s;een it, they will fall down and adore that great Power and Maje&s;ty. I&s;ai. lxvi. 23, 24. <HI>And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that from one new Moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, &s;hall all Fle&s;h come to Wor&s;hip before me, &s;aith the Lord; and they &s;hall go forth and look upon the Car|ca&s;&s;es of the Men that have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t me; for their Worm &s;hall not die, neither &s;hall their Fire be quenched, and they &s;hall be an abhorring unto all Fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. 'Tis <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> Wrath. It would be dreadful to &s;uf|fer this Fiercene&s;s and Wrath of Almighty GOD one Mo|ment; but you mu&s;t &s;uffer it to all Eternity: There will be no End to this exqui&s;ite horrible Mi&s;ery: When you look forward, you &s;hall &s;ee a long Forever, a boundle&s;s Duration before you, which will &s;wallow up your Thoughts, and amaze your Soul, and you will ab&s;olutely de&s;pair of ever having any Deliverance, any End, any Mitigation, any Re&s;t at all; you will know certainly, that you mu&s;t wear out long Ages, Millions of Millions of Ages, in wre&s;tling and conflicting with this almighty mercile&s;s Vengeance, and then, when you have &s;o done, when &s;o many Ages have actually been &s;pent by you in this Manner, you will know, that all is but a Point to what remains.

<P>How dreadful is the State of tho&s;e that are daily and hourly in Danger of this great Wrath, and infinite Mi&s;ery!
