<P>IT is very Obvious that the Words now read are the &s;econd Petition, in that which is commonly called, <HI>The Lords Prayer,</HI> delivered by our Lord, near the middle of that Divine Sermon He Preach|ed in the Mount; delivered as a mo&s;t Excellent Formulary, Pattern, and Platform of Prayer, unto which, all our Prayers are to be conform|ed, as to <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Manner,</HI> as appears by the
<PB N="2" REF="001289_0004_0FB22B2E16021820">
Words of our Lord, in the Prologue to this Prayer, <HI>v.</HI> 9. <HI>After this</HI> Manner <HI>therefore Pray ye, i. e.</HI> con&s;onant, and agreeable here-unto: Nor know I any inconvenience, if the very Words be u&s;ed, as the ca&s;e may require.</P>
<P>In this Prayer may be con&s;idered. (1.) The Preface, in which God is de&s;cribed,</P>
<P N="1">1. In Relation to us, [<HI>Our Father,</HI>] an En|dearing Relation, Inviting and Encouraging all his Children to make their Addre&s;&s;es to Him, with <HI>Confidence</HI>; That he bears like affections, &amp; incomparably greater, than any Earthly Parents can do to their Children: And with <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> that they &s;hall be heard, in all Things they call upon Him for, which are according to his Will, in the Name of His Son.</P>
<P N="2">2. God is here farther de&s;cribed in Relation to his own Severeign Maje&s;ty, [<HI>Which art in Heaven,</HI>] admoni&s;hing us to keep our Di&s;tance when we come before Him; <HI>not to be ra&s;h with our Mouth, or let our heart be ha&s;ty to utter any thing before God; for God is in Heaven, and we are upon Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) As to the <HI>Matter,</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> of the&s;e Pe|titions, we are directed, That the things which regard the Glory of God, have the <HI>Deference</HI> and <HI>Preference,</HI> to tho&s;e of our own Nece&s;&s;ities. Hence we fir&s;t Pray, for the Sanctification of the Name of God, and the E&s;tabli&s;hing of the Kingdom of his Son, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before other things.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001289_0005_0FB2768B125976C8">[<HI>Thy Kingdom come.</HI>]</P>
<P>By Kingdom I under&s;tand, not that <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> Kingdom, which the Son hath in common with his Father, as he is King of <HI>Na|tions</HI>: But that <HI>Mediatorial,</HI> and <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ator</HI>) King|dom, which he hath received by <HI>Donation,</HI> and <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">putation</HI> from his Father, as King of Saints. The Admini&s;tration of which Kingdom is com|mitted to the Son, till the con&s;ummation of all things; When he &s;hall have delivered up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, as fully com|pleated, and accompli&s;hed; all the Elect gather|ed; all Enemies &s;ubdued; When God &s;hall be all in all, and the Son &s;hall Reign together with the Father&punc; throughout the interminable Revo|lutions of Eternity, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.24.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Kingdom is <HI>Spiritual</HI>; Not exerci&s;ed over mens natural Lives, or E&s;tates: Our Lord when upon the Earth, would not inter-meddle with dividing Inheritances, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12, 13, 14. His Kingdom is not of this World; it is over the Hearts and Con&s;ciences of men; Ca&s;ting down &s;trong holds, &s;ilencing carnal rea&s;onings, bring|ing over the affections, &amp; bringing the Thoughts to the obedience of Chri&s;t, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.5. Awak|ning and Terrifying the Con&s;ciences of Hypo|crites: but &s;peaking Peace to the hearts of his People.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Eternal</HI>; It is a Kingdom which &s;hall never be de&s;troyed, nor left to other People: <HI>Dan.</HI> 2.44.
<PB N="4" REF="001289_0006_0FB2768C8F595628">
<HI>A Kingdom which cannot be moved,</HI> Heb. 12.28. Other Kingdoms may be &s;haken to their foun|dations; and their Kings be &s;haken out of their Thrones. But unto the Son, he &s;aith, <HI>Thy Throne, O God is for ever and ever,</HI> Heb. 1.8. But this mu&s;t be under&s;tood as to the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of it, for, as to the pre&s;ent form and manner of Ad|mini&s;tration, as it is now di&s;pen&s;ed by Officers, and Ordinances; it is limited to the Time of the End, when the Son &s;hall deliver it up to God, in like manner as he received it from God: But as to the Sub&s;tance, He &s;hall be Head of his Church for ever; an everla&s;ting Father, and of his Kingdom there &s;hall be no End, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.33.</P>
<P>The coming of this Kingdom is,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Internal</HI>; it is within us, <HI>Luk.</HI> 17.21. <HI>Comes not with Ob&s;ervation,</HI> as earthly Monarchies doe, who&s;e Original, Foundations, Con&s;titutions, Growth, Declen&s;ions, Tran&s;lations, lie open to the Ob&s;ervation, and Di&s;cour&s;es of Learned Men. But this is the Rule of Gods Spirit in the hearts of his People, con&s;i&s;ting in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Peace, and Joy; the Growth and Multiplication of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, from the gracious Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>External</HI>; In the powerful Admini&s;tration of Go&s;pel Ordinances; gathering Multitudes of Subjects under the Government of Chri&s;t: a vi|&s;ible, and glorious appearance thereof, accom|panied with abundance of Peace and Pro&s;perity,
<PB N="5" REF="001289_0007_0FB2768E0E7AC598">
according to the Promi&s;es, P&s;al. 72.7. <HI>In his dayes &s;hall the righteous flouri&s;h; and abundance of Peace, &s;o long as the Moon endureth.</HI> I&s;a. 2.2, 3, 4. <HI>And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, in the la&s;t dayes, That the Mountain of the Lords hou&s;e &s;hall be E&s;tabli&s;hed in the Top of the Mountains,</HI> &amp;c. and many other Scrip|tures.</P>
<P>The Doctrinal Ob&s;ervation which I &s;hall take up from the&s;e words, may be to this pur|po&s;e:
<Q><P>That it ought to be the great Concern of a Religious People of all Orders, faithfully to Endeavour in their &s;everal Capacities, the promoting of the Kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>In order to the Illu&s;tration of this Truth, let it be Enquired,</HI> When it may be &s;aid, That the Kingdom of CHRIST makes Advances among&s;t a Religious People?</P></Q></P>
<P>Take the an&s;wer under the following Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When the Name of God is duly Sanctified by them, and among&s;t them.</HI> It is ea&s;ie to ob&s;erve, that in this Head, I have regard to the order of the Petitions; <HI>Hallowed be thy Name: Thy Kingdom Come.</HI> When a Profe&s;&s;ing People do give unto God the Glory due to his Name, then may it be &s;aid, that the Kingdom of God is come unto them, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 29, 1, 2. And this they
<PB N="6" REF="001289_0008_0FB2768F8F41BB30">
may d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by their Faith, Works, and Wor&s;hip: When they are &s;ound in the faith of the Go&s;pel. He that would build high, had need to &s;ee that the Foundation Stones be deeply &amp; truly laid. Faith in God is a Foundation-&s;tone; <HI>He that comes to God, mu&s;t believe that He is.</HI> Now when a People do believe in God, and do believe in Je&s;us, the Chri&s;t of God, the Lords Chri&s;t, the Kingdom of God is come among&s;t them; when they acknowledge no God but He who is the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; When they do embrace, profe&s;s and contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints; and what they do believe in their heart, they are ready when orderly called to it, to make con|fe&s;&s;ion thereof with their mouth unto Salvation. Again, When their faith blo&s;&s;oms forth to Love, and Love fructifies unto good Works; when Faith works by Love, and Love to God doth excite and con&s;train &s;uch a people to keep the Commandments of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When a Profe&s;&s;ing People do Wor&s;hip God accor|ding to his own Mind, as to the Matter, Means, and Manner of Wor&s;hip.</HI> When the Mind of Chri&s;t, and not mans Mi&s;take, is made the Rule of Wor&s;hip: <HI>But in vain do they wor&s;hip m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,</HI> Mat. 15.9.

<PB N="7" REF="001289_0009_0FB276916171A928">
Altar is &s;et upon its right Ba&s;is, and they who Mini&s;ter at the Altar, do &s;ee that all things be done according to the Pattern. When a Peo|ple do Wor&s;hip God after the due Order, not in an External, Augu&s;t and Pompous Way of Wor&s;hip only, but in Spirit and in Truth, with reverence and godly fear, agreeable to the &s;im|plicity of the Primitive and Pure&s;t Times.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When Gods Sabbaths are Religiou&s;ly Ob&s;erved.</HI> Many have truly Remarked, That Religion flouri&s;hes or decays, lives or dies, as Gods Sab|baths are Sanctify'd or Prophan'd; let this vein be cut, and the vitals of Religion will &s;oon drop forth. If the Lords-Day be thrown up, and laid in common with the other days of the Week, Good men may ju&s;tly fear, it will not be long, before God will remove his Kingdom from &s;uch an unthankful people. But if a Peo|ple &s;hall turn away their foot from polluting Gods Sabbath, from doing their plea&s;ure on his Holy Day, and &s;hall call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They may expect much of the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t among&s;t them, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 58.13.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Another promi&s;ing &s;ymptom of the Pro&s;perous State of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, is, When Conver&s;i|ons are frequent,</HI> and multitudes are born to Chri&s;t, numerous as the drops of dew from the womb of the morning, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 110.3. <HI>When the Kingdom of Heaven &s;uffers violence, and the violent

take it by force</HI>: When the doors of Gods Hou&s;e &s;tand open continually, and many enter in&punc; When the Church hath frequent occa&s;ion to &s;ay, <HI>Who hath begotten me the&s;e?</HI> I&s;a. 49.21. Who are the&s;e that flee as a Cloud, as doves to their windows. When the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>God,</HI> re&s;ts up|on a Religious People, <HI>Behold! a Troop comes</HI>; when one &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>I am the Lords, and another &s;hall call him&s;elf by the name of Jacob, and another &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe with his hand unto the Lord, and Sir|name him&s;elf by the name of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>When Converted Ones do grow and thrive, and make increa&s;e with the increa&s;e of God,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.18. When Profe&s;&s;ors bring forth much fruit, and a|bound in the work of the Lord; when they walk worthy of God, who hath called them to his Kingdom and Glory; when they bring forth Fruit unto, and in old age, and the lon|ger they live, the more grace they have, the more holy, humble, heavenly-minded; and as natural bodies move &s;wifter near their Centre: &s;o gracious Souls, the nearer Heaven, the more ha&s;te they make thither.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>When a People are acted with a holy zeal for God, and again&s;t Sin; zealous for the Doctrine, Di&s;cipline, Order, and Government of Chri&s;t</HI>: Act|ing from the &s;ame Spirit, as of old, <HI>Phineas</HI> and <HI>Elijah,</HI> who cannot bear them which are evil, who having Tried them who &s;ay they are A|po&s;tles and are not, have found them Liars&punc;

Who&s;e Zeal is kindled with a Coal from Gods Altar, and governed by knowledge, to the ends of Gods Glory, the promoting Truth, Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and Peace, acceptable to God, and ap|proved of men.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>When Families are Seminaries of Piety and Vertue.</HI> As Religion began, &s;o is it maintain'd and pre&s;erv'd in Families. Now when Heads of Families do exerci&s;e their Authority, in Commanding their Children and Hou&s;hold af|ter them, <HI>That they may keep the way of the Lord</HI>: Religion will be kept alive. Well-govern'd Families re&s;emble little Churches, and afford matter for greater. When our Sons and our Daughters are prun'd and poli&s;ht in their youth, by good government in the Family; they may be &s;uitably prepared, the one to be planted in Chri&s;t's Garden, the other to be laid in the Building of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>When Civil Rulers are keepers of both the Ta|bles</HI>: Do rule with God, and for God, and re|membring their Character [<HI>I have &s;aid ye are gods</HI>] do Exert their Divine Vertues and Ac|compli&s;hments; to the Weal of their People, cheri&s;hing tho&s;e that are good, and like the mo&s;t High, being kind to the Unthankful; &amp; a people thus favour'd and ble&s;s'd do &s;trengthen the hands and hearts of their Rulers, and do chearfully render them the double, treble ho|nour of Countenance, Maintenance and Obe|dience.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="10" REF="001289_0012_0FB2769DA03C4608">9. <HI>When Go&s;pel Churches are Candle&s;ticks of Gold, not only gilt.</HI> When the Lights in the Candle|&s;ticks, are burning and &s;hining Lights, and they who bear the Ve&s;&s;els of the Lord are all holy; when the Angels of the Churches do &s;u&s;tain that Character, not in Name and Title only, but in regard of holine&s;s, agility and indefati|gablene&s;s in the Service of their Lord. When the Churches Stars are not falling Stars, nor wandring Stars, but fixed, ca&s;ting forth their borrowed Light, to the loo&s;ning the bands of Tempe&s;tuous Orion, delivering Sin-bound Souls from the cords of their iniquities, and reviving drooping Spirits, with &s;weet Influences, as the Pleiades. When the work of Chri&s;t pro&s;pers in their hands, and the Kingdom of Chri&s;t ri|&s;es up to Elated degrees under their Admini|&s;trations; moving the glad Spectators to cry, <HI>Grace! Grace</HI>! to it.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>When the practice of Second-Table Duties, Enters into the Character of a Profe&s;&s;ing People, and becomes a con&s;iderable part of it.</HI> We know that general Rule, Phil. 4.8. <HI>What&s;oever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good report, think on the&s;e things</HI>; bring them down into practice. Without the&s;e, the loude&s;t Profe&s;&s;ion is but as &s;ounding bra&s;s, or a tinkling cymbal. It is a reproach to Religion when the Profe&s;&s;ors of it,

<P N="11">11. <HI>When a Profe&s;&s;ing People do faithfully endea|vour to pre&s;erve the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</HI> Do &s;tand fa&s;t in one Spirit with one mind, &s;triving together for the faith of the Go&s;|pel.

<P>This Truth may be farther argued,</P>

They propound|ed to them&s;elves higher and more noble Ends; their De&s;ign it was to Exalt our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his Kingly Office, to lay the Foun|dations of his Kingdom in the Remote Parts of the Earth, where Satan had &s;o long u&s;urp'd quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that this part of the Earth might be leaven'd with the &s;avour of the Go&s;pel, as well as her other Si&s;ters; that they and their Children might &s;erve God in the Wilderne&s;s.

<P>WISDOM is commended in this Chapter, for its U&s;efulne&s;s to Men, in &s;everal Ca&s;es.</P>

In that it doth direct them how to deport them&s;elves, towards <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Ru|lers</HI>; &s;o as to keep them in their <HI>Obedience,</HI> grounded on the Oath of God, which they have &s;olemnly taken, Namely, <HI>The Oath of Allegiance,</HI> which Subjects Swear to their Prince; <HI>I coun&s;el thee to keep the Kings Commandment, and that in re|gard of the Oath of God,</HI> v. 2. And that they may avoid tho&s;e dangers, and precipices which fooli&s;h men, through their folly and indi&s;cretion do ca&s;t them&s;elves into: <HI>Be not ha&s;ty to go out of his &s;ight: &s;tand not in an Evil thing: for he doeth what&s;oever

plea&s;eth him. Who&s;o keepeth the Commandment &s;hall feel no evil thing,</HI>: v. 3, 5.</P>
<P N="2">2. Wi&s;dom furni&s;hes men with Expedients in their Preparations, for the prevention of tho&s;e Unhappy Accidents and evil Occurrents, which do frequently happen in this changeable World, and are many, unfore&s;een, intricate, and not o|therwi&s;e to be avoided: <HI>v.</HI> 6, 7, 8.</P>

Some Rea&s;ons why all Sinners are not pre&s;ently puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Rea&s;. 1. <HI>God forbears to puni&s;h &s;peedily, that men may have a &s;pace to Reform, and grow better. I gave her &s;pace to repent,</HI> Rev. 2.21. <HI>Differt paenam dum Expectat poenitentiam</HI>: So <HI>Hierom</HI>: He deferreth the puni&s;hment, while he Expecteth Repentance. Puni&s;hment is not the primary intention of the Supream Law-giver: The Law of God (as other Laws) binds to Obedience; Puni&s;hment is &s;u|peradded in a Secondary way, to reduce men to their Duty: Hence God warns, and waits before He &s;trikes. We read of the Riches of Gods for|bearance, <HI>Rom</HI> 2.4. It is the forbearance of God which makes Him rich in Souls, the Salvation of Thou&s;ands of Souls is owing to the forbearance and long-&s;uffering of God. It is the Patience of
<PB N="5" REF="001289_0029_0FB276C3F453A528">
the good Shepherd that &s;eeks, finds, and brings home the wandring Sheep; when impatience would ea&s;ily neglect, and de&s;pi&s;e a &s;ingle Sheep. The patient Father Receives, Cloaths, Fea&s;ts the Prodigal Son, and makes Apology for him too, to his di&s;contented Brother. Had <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> been cut off in the full carreer of his Sin, we &s;hould not have heard of his Repentance, Re&s;tauration, and Reformation.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God &s;ometimes &s;pares wicked men, that they may be Improved as In&s;truments to puni&s;h others.</HI> He lets loo&s;e the Nations, and &s;uffers them to break in upon one another, that they may afflict, vex and puni&s;h one another. God made a Rod of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> to &s;courge the Hypocri&s;y of his own People, I&s;a. 10.5. <HI>O A&s;&s;yrian the rod of mine anger.</HI> The great Invader of the Peace &amp; quiet of <HI>Europe,</HI> as ju&s;tly de&s;erves to be called, <HI>Flagel|lum Dei,</HI> as ever <HI>Totilas</HI> did, as if rai&s;ed up on purpo&s;e to di&s;quiet the Nations. When God has done his Work by &s;uch In&s;truments, He will do his Work upon them; He will puni&s;h them: <HI>When the Lord hath performed his whole work upon Mount Sion,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I will puni&s;h the fruit of the &s;tout heart of the King of A&s;&s;yria,</HI> v. 12. Thus <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> after all his Slaughters and bloud-&s;hed, it came at la&s;t to his own turn, he was ignominiou&s;ly &s;lain in the <HI>Senate-hou&s;e,</HI> by &s;ome of his pretended friends.</P>
<P N="3"><PB REF="001289_0030_0FB276C5949E7528">3. <HI>Wicked men may in &s;ome &s;en&s;e be Spared, yet not Exempted from Puni&s;hment.</HI> Wickedne&s;s car|ries its puni&s;hment along with it: Guilt la&s;hes the Con&s;cience with invi&s;ible Strokes; a guilty Con&s;cience is its own Tormentor; no fury like it. Hence Wicked men are likened to the trou|bled Sea, when it cannot re&s;t, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 57.20. When <HI>Paul</HI> a Pri&s;oner rea&s;oned of Judgment to come, <HI>Felix,</HI> though a Judge, trembled; the Lion with|in was awakened, and began to roar. After <HI>Nero</HI> had Murdered his Mother, he was ever haunted and tormented with her Gho&s;t: Sin not repented of lies gnawing, and feeding as a Vul|ture on the Entrails. Now we &s;ee the Out-ward Splendor and Grandieur of Wicked men, but we &s;ee not the inward inquietude, and anxiety of their Minds; we &s;ee the Silk Stocking, but not the Ulcerated Legg under it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The time wicked men are Spared, is not &s;o long as we think for.</HI> We reckon time by &s;hort and &s;canty mea&s;ures, and a little time &s;eems long to us: Gods forbearance of Sinners, though for many years, is nothing compared with his dura|tion; <HI>A thou&s;and years are but as one day,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.8.

part of mans &s;hort Life, his Sin unrepented of, finds him out. The Malefactor is not acquitted becau&s;e the Execution is defer'd unto the Even|ing.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The proper Time for the Puni&s;hment of Wicked men, is not yet come.</HI> That is another rea&s;on why they are forborn: <HI>To every thing there is a &s;ea&s;on.</HI> They are not yet ripe for de&s;truction, they have not yet filled up the mea&s;ure of their Sin: The iniquity of the <HI>Amorites</HI> was not full in <HI>Abrahams</HI> time, <HI>Gen.</HI> 15.16.

What has been &s;aid may be Im|proved to Vindicate the Ju&s;tice of Providence, in the Government of the World, from the Im|putations of men, who either cannot &s;ee far off, or do pa&s;s a judgment too &s;oon, before Provi|dence hath done its work. It hath very much Exerci&s;ed the thoughts of Inqui&s;itive men a|mong the Heathen, when they ob&s;erved Wick|edne&s;s Pro&s;perous, but Virtue Oppre&s;&s;ed; and hath cau&s;ed them to &s;peak very doubtfully, if not altogether deny, the Being of Divine Providence. <HI>Pompey</HI> fights for Glory and is Victorious; but when he turns his Arms to pre&s;erve his Coun|trys Liberty, he falls a Victim before the Ambi|tion of his Corrival. And it is not &s;o much to be admired, becau&s;e they wanted Divine Reve|lation. But others there have been, who have been furni&s;hed with more Excellent In&s;tructions, than Nature can teach, who yet for a time could not &s;atisfy them&s;elves on this head. <HI>I was Envious at the fooli&s;h</HI> (&s;aid that good man) <HI>when I &s;aw the Pro&s;perity of the Wicked,</HI> P&s;al. 73.3.

While the Hou&s;e is in building (perhaps it is the &s;ame Learned mans &s;imilitude) the Materials lie here and there in heaps, in a di&s;orderly and uncomely manner, but when the Hou&s;e is fini&s;h'd, a beautiful fabrick pre&s;ents it &s;elf to our Eye: we often judge before the time, and &s;o make fal&s;e Judgments.
