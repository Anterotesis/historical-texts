<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR particular reque&s;t, and the con|&s;tant demand of the public, have at length inclined me to con&s;ent to the printing of this &s;ermon; &s;eeing that the armed force is now removed, which, by the &s;trange u&s;e, that was lately made of it, put us all without di&s;tinction in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By de&s;cription, the face of things in Blackman|&s;treet, on the 10th of <HI>May</HI> in the Afternoon, was like that of a town taken by a foreign enemy, and expecting military execution: The Shops were all &s;hut up, the people a&s;&s;aulted as they were en|tring their own hou&s;es, driven about like &s;heep, and made the &s;port of &s;uch infamous wretches as the common &s;oldiers, who had the in&s;olence to pre&s;ent their pieces at tho&s;e who from their up|per chambers looked out into the &s;treet. How would the Londoners have liked &s;uch treatment? And yet it is evident, that the Town&s;men and hou&s;e-keepers of Blackman-&s;treet were never in any riot, or had any more concern with the people in <HI>St. George</HI>'s <HI>Fields,</HI> than the citizens and hou&s;e-keepers in <HI>Cheap&s;ide.</HI> As for the great road and <HI>Newington</HI> cau&s;eway, it was &s;o dangerous, that be&s;ide the death of the people in and near the Hay-market, the balls penetrated the very &s;hut|ters of the windows at a great di&s;tance from the place of action in the fields. Ought not procla|mation to have been made for the people to have left their hou&s;es? and notice given in the adja|cent villages, to have prevented the inhabitants from coming abroad, who knew nothing of the mi&s;chief that was intended?</NOTE> danger of our lives.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>LEVITICUS, Chap. xxiv.21 and 22 ver&s;es</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;He that killeth a man, he &s;hall be put to death.</P>
<P>Ye &s;hall have <HI>one manner of law,</HI> as well for the <HI>&s;tran|ger,</HI> as for one <HI>of your own country;</HI> for I am the <HI>LORD your GOD.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE laws of God, as delivered to us by his &s;ervant <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> have been di&s;|tingui&s;hed into three &s;orts, or kinds; and pa&s;s under the &s;everal denomi|nations of eccle&s;ia&s;tical, moral and civil.</P>
<P>The eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws have re&s;pect only to matters in religion, de&s;cribing the na|ture and attributes of God, and the general &s;ervice, which he challenges as Creator and Governor, from all mankind; or particular &s;ervice, which was to be rendered him by his peculiar people, according to the cere|monies of the Jewi&s;h church.</P>
<P>THE moral laws pre&s;cribe rules for a man's private conduct; as a moral agent.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012772_0008_0F8A934845E3D3E8">BUT the civil, be&s;ide the moral ends and purpo&s;es of individuals, have al&s;o the com|munity for their object; and inform a man, how he is to conduct him&s;elf as a citizen, or a &s;ubject of a common-wealth.</P>
<P>NOW the&s;e precepts, which I have here read, are of a civil nature, and in&s;truct us how we are to behave as members of a community, in ca&s;es of injury to our neigh|bour; whether that injury relate to his property or his per&s;on. For the pa&s;&s;age more at large is to this effect.</P>
<P><HI>BREACH for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he cau&s;ed a blemi&s;h in a man, &s;o &s;hall it be done to him again. He that killeth a bea&s;t &s;hall re&s;tore it, and he that killeth a</HI> man, <HI>&s;hall be put to</HI> death. <HI>Ye &s;hall have</HI> one man|ner of law, <HI>as well for the</HI> &s;tranger, <HI>as for one</HI> of your own country; <HI>for I am the Lord your God.</HI></P>
<P>ASSIST us therefore almighty God! that with all due attention we may acquire in the fir&s;t place a proper notion of thy immence authority, and how far it exceeds that of human lawgivers; and then we &s;hall be able more clearly to di&s;cover and duly con&s;ider the high impiety, and fatal con&s;equences of &s;creening or abetting murder.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="012772_0009_0F8A934907C6B518">BUT fir&s;t, as the almighty here urges his authority, as the cau&s;e that challenges obedience to this law; <HI>Do it&mdash; for I am the Lord thy God</HI>&mdash;Let us con&s;ider with fear and trembling the extent of his authority, and how far it exceeds that of human lawgivers.</P>
<P>THE authority of God then, as the &s;u|preme lawgiver, being founded upon two of his attributes; his infinite unerring wi&s;|dom, in di&s;cerning always what is fitte&s;t to be done, on the one hand; and his infinite and irre&s;i&s;tible power, always ready to com|mand obedience to his ordinances, on the other: It comes to pa&s;s from hence, that eve|ry human law mu&s;t either be taken directly from the laws of God; or el&s;e be &s;o &s;trictly &s;ubordinate, and conformable to his laws, as not to carry with it the lea&s;t appearance of oppo&s;ition to the &s;ame. For if that were po&s;&s;ible, there might be laws of human in|vention, which might oppo&s;e them&s;elves to the will of God, which attempt we &s;hall find by the &s;equel to be not only impious with re&s;pect to God, but unwarrantable, and impracticable, with re&s;pect to man.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, BECAUSE they are only &s;uch laws, as are conformable to the will of God, that can give a magi&s;trate a right to command obedience.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, BECAUSE they are only &s;uch, that
<PB N="12" REF="012772_0010_0F8A934A938DE3D0">
can be u&s;eful to &s;ociety: and therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3dly, ONLY &s;uch, that will be &s;ubmitted to by the bulk of mankind, without rebel|lion, or re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t demon&s;tration then of God's &s;uperiority as a lawgiver is evident from hence, that none but &s;uch laws as are con|formable to his will can impower an hu|man magi&s;trate to require, or command obedience. For all human powers become powers, and derive their whole force from conforming them&s;elves in their conduct to the will of God. Every act of theirs, which is oppo&s;ed to God's ordinances, is in it&s;elf null and void. And if the whole admini&s;tration of any power be only a re|petition of &s;uch acts, then that power cea&s;es of cour&s;e to be a legi&s;lature: The whole &s;eries of government from the beginning having been illegal, in being a power op|po&s;ing it&s;elf to the ordinances of God, and by con&s;equence no power at all, &s;ince the powers, that be, mu&s;t be ordained by him, and as &s;uch mu&s;t conform to his ordinances in every act of their juri&s;diction. If any one think that this conclu&s;ion is not fairly collected, let him con&s;ider upon this occa|&s;ion the nature of God's &s;upremacy.</P>
<P>FOR as he is the &s;upreme being, and the center of all power, the power of making
<PB N="13" REF="012772_0011_0F8A934C5F7EF530">
laws and of governing by them mu&s;t be originally and independently in him alone. Nothing under God can pretend to that power independent of him. For the in|dependency of any power nece&s;&s;arily &s;up|po&s;es &s;upremacy. As the &s;upremacy of God therefore gives to him alone the origi|nal and independent power of making laws, &s;o it makes it a property to his laws, that his and only his excluded all po&s;&s;ibi|lity of doubt and he&s;itation about the obedience, which we are to render them.</P>
<P>BECAUSE there is no will above his, which we can offend, or power above his, which we need to fear. His ab&s;olute dominion re|moves every doubt about his authority. All he&s;itation on that head ari&s;ing from a fear of offence to a per&s;on more powerful than him, whom we are ordered to obey, and who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure may for that rea&s;on bring a greater inconvenience upon our|&s;elves. As therefore there is none more powerful than God, an immediate obedi|ence to his laws is nece&s;&s;arily and inexcu&s;|ably due upon all occa&s;ions; which thing is a great intrenchment upon human pow|er, and lays us under a continual nece&s;&s;ity of examining human injunctions by the rule of God's ordinances, in order to &s;ee that they do not cla&s;h with them.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012772_0012_0F8A934D0E5ECD70">FOR as man is &s;o infinitely inferior to God, laws pre&s;cribed by any, of human race, are as different in obligation from tho&s;e pre&s;cribed by God, as a creature is different from his Creator. It is of the na|ture of human laws therefore, by whom&s;o|ever they &s;hall be enacted, that they can|not of authority command obedience, till they appear upon the ca&s;e to be agreeable to God's ordinances. Whereas laws which are conformable to the will of God would be obeyed voluntarily, without any com|mand of a magi&s;trate, for the &s;ole rea&s;on of their u&s;e, and excellence.</P>
<P N="2">II. WHICH leads me to another rea&s;on why all human laws mu&s;t be conformable to the will of God, from the con&s;ideration that only &s;uch can be beneficial to mankind.</P>
<P>FOR if we are &s;en&s;ible that the laws of God, as far as they are di&s;cerned by us, do all of them center in the happine&s;s of man, both of individuals and of whole &s;ocieties, it is a natural con&s;equence, that whatever injunctions oppo&s;e tho&s;e laws, mu&s;t oppo&s;e at the &s;ame time human happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS truth perhaps may &s;trike and effect us more &s;trongly if we illu&s;trate it by par|ticular in&s;tances. For example, let us imagine that natural equity and ju&s;tice
<PB N="15" REF="012772_0013_0F8A934D8E5641F0">
one of the primary or principal laws of God &s;hould be violated for the &s;ake of &s;ome oppo&s;ite human law, and you will &s;oon &s;ee in what degree that human law will be detrimental. For natural ju&s;tice and equity having regard to the rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of things, and di&s;tributing to every one, what his circum&s;tances in impartial right require, the law which goes about to rever&s;e it, mu&s;t overturn all fitne&s;s, oppo&s;e all rea&s;on, and take from every one what his condition and circum&s;tances by impartial right re|quire. Suppo&s;e the decemviri at <HI>Rome,</HI> or the whole <HI>Roman</HI> &s;enate, or the council of five hundred at <HI>Athens,</HI> under the pretence of quelling a riot had &s;igned a decree to draw out a party of their forces, mercena|ries, which they paid and fed for their own defence, and place them in &s;uch manner that they &s;hould, under the pretext of the riot, privately &s;hoot at and de&s;troy a num|ber of their innocent &s;ubjects pa&s;&s;ing at a di&s;tance in the public ways upon their own peaceable concerns, and not &s;u&s;pecting danger.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, that after the &s;laughter, they &s;hould exult publicly in a weak and cowardly manner upon the death of the&s;e innocent, unarmed, un&s;u&s;pecting people, as though they had defeated the army of a
<PB N="16" REF="012772_0014_0F8A934F65157050">
foreign enemy, publicly thank their mili|tary executioners for their bloody &s;ervice, tell them, that they had done their duty and that they highly approved of their conduct; encourage them further to do their work of blood with alacrity, promi&s;|ing them all the protection again&s;t the laws, which their office could afford them, if &s;uch protection &s;hould ever be wanted upon a like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>COULD ordinances and injunctions like the&s;e be beneficial to &s;ociety, or could any one pretend to deny, but that by conform|ing to them all outward order mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, and all inward peace di&s;turbed? For what makes the mind of man ea&s;y is, that he &s;ees his affairs run in the right chan|nel, and that he is dealt with in the man|ner, that he might rea&s;onably expect to be dealt with: As on the contrary if any thing rever&s;e the equitable di&s;tribution of things, by cau&s;ing mi&s;ery, it as nece&s;&s;arily cau&s;es anxiety and di&s;content, as ju&s;tice produces peace and harmony.</P>
<P>FURTHER we are to ob&s;erve, that when outward order is de&s;troyed by cruelty, and the inward peace of men's minds di&s;turb|ed, civil troubles and commotions mu&s;t by degrees en&s;ue. For peace and &s;ecurity are the end and aim of all human labour;
<PB N="17" REF="012772_0015_0F8A9350173DDFF8">
we keep our lives for their enjoyment, and hazard them for their purcha&s;e. As men are thus &s;pirited and informed by nature, we may imagine that they will be very much alarmed under the apprehen&s;ion of &s;uch rules or orders, as threaten their na|tural peace and &s;ecurity, and thereby de|&s;troy their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IT will appear, therefore, in the third place, that &s;uch laws or orders as are not conformable to the will of God, by being of no u&s;e or benefit, but really hurtful to mankind, will be attended with this other inconvenience, that they will rarely be re|ceived or obeyed with quietne&s;s.</P>
<P>FOR public di&s;content and trouble &s;oon pa&s;s into open oppo&s;ition. In &s;uch ca&s;es, it is generally, only a defect of the means of re&s;i&s;tance, or the power of helping them&s;elves, which can keep people in &s;ub|jection, &s;uppo&s;ing that tho&s;e, who are thus oppre&s;&s;ed and irritated, are barely permit|ted but to live. Human re&s;entment, when continually kept awake, will be contriv|ing all the means, and ob&s;erving every opportunity, to re&s;i&s;tan unju&s;t and tyran|nic injunction. Similitude of misfor|tunes &s;oon forms and fixes an alliance&punc; Alliances multiply in an intere&s;ting cau&s;e:
<PB N="18" REF="012772_0016_0F8A935099D265B8">
And as &s;trength increa&s;es, accidents, when carefully watched, are &s;eldom wanting to furni&s;h an opportunity for open and avow|ed re&s;i&s;tance, to which men are encourag|ed by that other con&s;ideration, that the law, which oppo&s;es their happine&s;s, is like|wi&s;e oppo&s;ite to the laws of God, and there|fore at the &s;ame time that it would injure them, in ca&s;e it were obeyed, it has really no right to command their obedience. Strong motives for them to di&s;obey! when be&s;ide their temporal intere&s;t, other re|flections at the &s;ame time naturally pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and give a religious &s;anction to their cau&s;e; as that they are to obey God rather than man, and regard him in the fir&s;t place, who is the &s;upreme lawgiver, and far more dreadful in his puni&s;hments than earthly tyranny in all its terrors.</P>
<P>HAVING thus con&s;idered the immen&s;e authority of God, as the &s;upreme legi&s;lator, and how far it exceeds that of human law|givers, namely, as far as infinite excels finite, we &s;hall be able readily to determine, whe|ther any human power can have a right to oppo&s;e or di&s;pen&s;e with his laws; par|ticularly that, which is &s;o clearly and ex|pre&s;sly declared in the text, and which make the foundation of human &s;afety in &s;ociety.&mdash;<HI>He that killeth a man &s;hall be put to
<PB N="19" REF="012772_0017_0F8A935278857F68">
death</HI>; in &s;upport of which I am now to &s;hew the impiety and fatal con&s;equences of &s;creening and abetting murder.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place then, any oppo&s;ition to this law would be the highe&s;t impiety. For as the command is &s;o very expre&s;s and clear, it would be flying in the face of God almighty to di&s;obey it. And therefore tho&s;e, who are concerned in &s;uch an attempt, let them be of what rank and condition they will, can expect nothing but God's vengeance in this life, and the in&s;upporta|ble terrors of that, which is to come. But be&s;ides the impiety of this attempt, and con&s;equent vengeance of God almighty, there are other arguments drawn from the inju&s;tice of &s;laying the innocent, and the danger ari&s;ing from &s;uch horrid crimes, not only to individuals therein concerned, but even to Governors them&s;elves in their public capacity, as render it quite imprac|ticable by the law of nature, and all the rules of ju&s;t policy, that this divine injunc|tion &s;hould ever be repealed or laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>FOR fir&s;t, by the laws of nature, every man has a right to &s;afety in his per&s;on, effects, and other circum&s;tances; unle&s;s that right be &s;ome how forfeited by mi&s;de|meanor. And therefore in civilized &s;oci|ety men are always con&s;idered in this views
<PB N="20" REF="012772_0018_0F8A9352C80A7CA8">
and are protected in the enjoyment of the&s;e privileges by the civil magi&s;trate. If that magi&s;trate acts in his true and proper cha|racter, he watches over the &s;afety of the people, and &s;hould re&s;i&s;t, repul&s;e, or puni&s;h tho&s;e, who hurt the &s;ubject. For imagine only the&s;e civil re&s;traints removed, and a military armed force let loo&s;e upon the defencele&s;s and innocent; and what deva&s;|tations, rapine and blood&s;hed, what afflicti|on, and mi&s;ery in every &s;hape, and on every &s;ide, mu&s;t overwhelm mankind? To fall pro&s;trate before the&s;e &s;avages, is to invite them to the &s;poil, and encourage them to &s;uch acts of violence as mu&s;t end in the de&s;truction of &s;ociety, by bani&s;hing from among men their &s;afety and their peace.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that in all countries &s;ome men ought to be oppo&s;ers of injuries by exacting blood for blood: And throughout the known world, where &s;ocieties are for|med, &s;ome men are really &s;et apart for that purpo&s;e. It may be ob&s;erved in different &s;tates and nations, that the&s;e are not al|ways people of exactly the &s;ame quality, or denomination: And for this there is good rea&s;on; becau&s;e tho&s;e circum&s;tances are to be regulated from time to time accord|ing to the original compact of the &s;tate, the great charter, which binds them to &s;ociety,
<PB N="21" REF="012772_0019_0F8A93549758F978">
and according to the various circum&s;tan|ces, under which, the common-wealth at different &s;ea&s;ons may &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>THE right of oppo&s;ing injuries, and of &s;laying a murderer, is originally to be &s;ure in every individual who is formed by na|ture to defend him&s;elf. But upon uniting in &s;ociety, men &s;o far transfer this right to tho&s;e, they call their Governors, as to exer|ci&s;e it no more them&s;elves, except in ca&s;es, where the Governor's power wilfully fails, or is accidentally not at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Rulers then, whether they be few or many, or by what&s;oever titles they may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, are, by their office con&s;tituted, and for this end hold their authority, to be a terror to murderers, and tho&s;e who do violence, and to defend the natural rights and privileges of their people. There is by nature a tacit compact of this kind between magi&s;trates and people: And in mo&s;t places an expre&s;s engagement confir|med by &s;olemn oaths, and obligations on both &s;ides. In forms of government &s;o circum&s;tanced, if the Governor fail to act the part a&s;&s;igned him, the condition of the obligation on the part of the people is void <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI>: For by lo&s;ing the character of protector he abdicates the right and title of a Prince.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="012772_0020_0F8A93554C45D880">SO that the neglect to puni&s;h murderers appears to be de&s;tructive to Princes them|&s;elves; as it may, and has &s;ometimes proved a means of depriving them of their autho|rity, at other times of lo&s;ing the affections of their people, and drawing a long train of misfortunes upon their own <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has been ob&s;erved of the po&s;terity of <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t, who&s;e favorite <HI>Carr,</HI> was one of the murderers of Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury.</HI> See more of this affair, and the character of the &s;aid <HI>James,</HI> in a Poem of the author's, entitled, the voluntary Exile.</NOTE> po&s;terity. Certain it is, that it has been a means to deprive them of their authority. Since we find that &s;overeigns are by their office re|quired as far as the &s;tate can enable them to ward off injuries; and therefore in ca&s;e of neglect the people have imagined, that they may re&s;ume this delegated power of re&s;i&s;ting injuries, and executing it for them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>NOR is this the only ca&s;e wherein the bad conduct of Princes has furni&s;hed the people with a plea for taking the reins of govern|ment into their own hands. For &s;uppo|&s;ing the &s;upreme magi&s;trate (which is na|tural enough upon for&s;aking his own &s;ub|jects) to league with the enemy; or upon his own motive, or choice to grow injuri|ous; the people have then taken upon them to re&s;i&s;t that magi&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="012772_0021_0F8A9355CBAD6CF8">
<Q>FOR, &s;ay they, if tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who are impowered and appointed for the defence of the &s;ociety, turn their authority and power again&s;t it, and in&s;tead of &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing, commit injuries, they are cer|tainly to be reputed public enemies. For a public enemy could do nothing wor&s;e. The power of re&s;i&s;ting injuries therefore mu&s;t in &s;uch a ca&s;e immediately change place; &s;ince for the pre&s;ervation of &s;o|ciety, it mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;ome where: And as the &s;ame per&s;on cannot at the &s;ame time be both offender and the puni&s;her of his own offences; it revolves then back to tho&s;e who gave it, and in regard it is to be employed again&s;t &s;uch as do injuries, it will bear hard upon tho&s;e, who are really found in that character, with|out re&s;pect had to any nominal di&s;tinc|tion.</Q>
This is very evident from the hi&s;tory of <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, who tho' a King by title, was formally arraigned for coun|tenancing the murder of his &s;ubjects, and executed accordingly as a criminal. From a per&s;ua&s;ion that the laws were equally a rule of action for the &s;ubject, and the Prince; con&s;equently, that if Princes broke the laws, they mu&s;t &s;uffer the penalties like other men.</P>
<P>SO dangerous is it for Princes to think, that they have a right of di&s;pen&s;ing with, or oppo&s;ing the laws of almighty God.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="012772_0022_0F8A9356967ECDE8">AND the deception has been quite as fatal to &s;uch, as have made them&s;elves their tools or advocates.</P>
<P>THOSE who will take the trouble of con|&s;ulting our ancient hi&s;tories, which if duly attended to, contain trea&s;ures of u&s;eful knowledge both for the &s;ubject, and the Prince will find the&s;e wrerches, I mean the advocates for bloody, and de&s;potic mea&s;ures, notwith&s;tanding their high expectation of reward, generally di&s;appointed of their hopes, treated for the mo&s;t part as the pe&s;ts of &s;ociety, followed by the execration of the people, or extingui&s;hed by a violent death.</P>
