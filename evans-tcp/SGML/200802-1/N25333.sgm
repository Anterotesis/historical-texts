<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> ON BILIOUS FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>FEVERS are termed bilious, when at their commencement, or during their progre&s;s, a greater quantity of bile is &s;ecreted and excreted than in time of health.</P>
<P>Fevers in which a preternatural or exce&s;&s;ive &s;ecre|tion and excretion of bile, is a characteri&s;tic &s;ymptom, have always more or le&s;s of a remi&s;&s;ion with re&s;pect to the violence of the feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms once in every twenty-four hours; this remi&s;&s;ion in the greate&s;t num|ber of ca&s;es takes place every day in the forenoon, and the feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms begin to encrea&s;e about noon, or imitating the type or form of what is called a dou|ble tertian ague, the remi&s;&s;ion comes on one day in the forenoon, and the next in the afternoon; or alter|nately one day in the afternoon, and the next in the forenoon.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BILIOUS FEVERS,</HEAD>
<P>Or fevers of the remitting kind accompanied with bi|lious evacuations, prevail more univer&s;ally than any other kind, and although they are not &s;o dangerous, or mortal, as pe&s;tilence or typhus, yet from the uni|ver&s;ality of their &s;way, and the frequency of their oc|currence they de&s;troy greater numbers in a cour&s;e of years, than any other kind or form of fever.</P>
<P>During, or &s;oon after the periodical rainy &s;ea&s;ons of the torrid zone, e&s;pecially where the &s;oil is moi&s;t and
<PB N="2" REF="033590_0005_0FF793BC73F24378">
un&s;heltered from the parching rays of a vertical &s;un, and abounds with putrefying vegetable and animal &s;ub|&s;tances. Fevers of a remitting type with reternatural excretions of bile, often occa&s;ion mortality almo&s;t equal to that of the A&s;iatic plague.</P>
<P>This fever not only de&s;troys the majority of new &s;ettlers in &s;uch &s;ituations, but renders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he con&s;titutions of tho&s;e who e&s;cape with life, infirm the remainder of their days.</P>
<P>In many parts of Europe, particularly where the &s;i|tuation is flat, and the &s;oil moi&s;t, this fiend &s;tretches his baneful &s;cepter over the &s;ickening land, the whole autumnal &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Along the Tyber in Italy, and on the flat grounds of Hungary in Germany, where the &s;ummers are long, and the heat extreme, bilious remitting fevers are the mo&s;t fatal in the catalogue of di&s;ea&s;es. Holland, which is little better than an exten&s;ive mora&s;s, though &s;itu|ated &s;o far north, is periodically vi&s;ited by the bilious fever. It al&s;o extends its &s;way to many parts of Eng|land and Ireland. Nor is the continent of North America exempt from its baneful power.</P>
<P>Throughout all the low grounds from Canada to Florida, this di&s;temper infe&s;ts the country at &s;tated periods.</P>
<P>That the bilious fever is only a variety of the inter|mitting fever, altered in its a&s;pect and &s;ymptoms by climate, &s;ea&s;on, &s;oil, and the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the atmo&s;phere, &amp;c. is rendered certain, from its prevailing in &s;imilar &s;ituations and &s;tates of the weather in all countries.</P>
<P>Thus, in the low grounds of &s;ome of the Provinces of Germany, tho&s;e fevers which owe their origin to the effluvia derived from a moi&s;t and putrid &s;oil, appear in the form of &s;imple tertians, or di&s;tinct quotidians, while in Hungary where the ground is more level, and the atmo&s;phere almo&s;t motionle&s;s for want of hills to con|duct the winds, the fever produced by the &s;ame ex|halations, appears in the form of a remittent, with ma|lignant &s;ymptoms and exce&s;&s;ive bilious evacuations, which in its progre&s;s, unle&s;s &s;peedily relieved by na|ture
<PB N="3" REF="033590_0006_0FF793BF8A4906B0">
or art, degenerates into a &s;tate of extreme debility, and di&s;plays &s;ymptoms exactly like tho&s;e of the mo&s;t malignant typhus, or putrid fever as it is commonly called, occa&s;ioned by contagion.</P>
<P>In Italy, a fever the &s;ame in kind, but differing in degree of violence, often appears in the &s;hape of a double tertian, or irregular remittent, and is often at|tended in its progre&s;s with pitechiae or purple &s;pots, and apthous ulcerations in the mouth and fauces.</P>
<P>In Holland the &s;ame occa&s;ional or efficient cau&s;e, produces a fever with di&s;tinct intermi&s;&s;ions every, or every third day.</P>
<P>In Ethiopia, and in all that tract of country from Sues to Babel Mondel, it gives the di&s;ea&s;e the &s;emblance of the pe&s;tilence in its mo&s;t malignant form.</P>
<P>In America, as well as in other countries, the fevers which are occa&s;ioned by the air of mar&s;hes, or the effluvia of putrefying vegetable or animal &s;ub&s;tances, are amazingly influenced in their a&s;pect and &s;ymptoms, by the &s;oil, &s;ituation, climate, &s;ea&s;on; and by the pre|ceding and pre&s;ent qualities of the atmo&s;phere, and the cu&s;tomary mode of living of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the nothern &s;tates, fevers from the recited cau&s;e, are &s;eldom epidemic, though ca&s;es of remitting fever are by no means rare in tho&s;e &s;tates, in mar&s;hy &s;itua|tions during the autumnal months, but they mo&s;tly ap|pear in the form of intermittents. In the middle &s;tates remittents with bilious evacuations are very common, but &s;eldom very complicated or malignant, except when the preceding &s;pring and &s;ummer have been moi&s;t and &s;ultry. Neither dry and hot, or wet and cool &s;um|mers, have been ob&s;erved to render this kind of fever either general or malignant: On the contrary, when it does occur after &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons, it is generally con|nected with an inflammatory diathe&s;is, and requires blood-letting and purging, repeated as often as the &s;ymptoms re&s;ume any appearance of violence, as well as the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen, to reduce it to its natural and &s;imple form. But in Vir|ginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, where the heat is more inten&s;e, and the &s;oil more putrid, along
<PB N="4" REF="033590_0007_0FF793C126C72F60">
the &s;hores and ouzy banks of large rivers and ponds of &s;tagnant water, particularly after the rice harve&s;t in September and October, when an exten&s;ive &s;urface of moi&s;t &s;oil is expo&s;ed to the piercing rays of the &s;un, a fever of the remitting kind is generated, which exhibits &s;ymptoms of alarming debility and malignancy; and yet, there is not one in&s;tance on record, of this fever however malignant and mortal it may have been to the per&s;ons affected by it, ever being contagious, or of having communicated a fever di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame a&s;&s;emblage of &s;ymptoms, from one per&s;on to another.</P>
<P>The authorities quoted by Dr. Ru&s;h, of its being contagious in other parts of the world, &s;hall be exa|mined in the cour&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>From the influence of climate and &s;ituation upon the con&s;titutions of the inhabitants, it is rea&s;onable to expect, that a diver&s;ity in the treatment of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e would be requi&s;ite. The &s;ugge&s;tions of rea&s;on are in this in&s;tance, &s;upported by the ob&s;ervations of authors of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive experience and &s;agacity; among the&s;e may be mentioned, Baglivi, Ziminerman, Pringle, Ti&s;&s;ot; and of more recent date, Lind, Bruce, and Jack&s;on.</P>
<P>That di&s;ea&s;es the &s;ame in kind, differing only in de|gree, require not only a treatment differing in degree, but in kind, we learn from the medical writers of dif|ferent countries.</P>
<P>Thus we are informed, that the inhabitants of France bear bleeding without injury, and often with evident benefit, in almo&s;t every form of fever that occurs there; while in Italy it is thought to do injury in almo&s;t every ca&s;e of fever. Emetics, and other evacuants, agree with the con&s;titutions of the Germans, while &s;udorifics and cordials &s;uit be&s;t to animate and warm the phleg|matic Hollander.</P>
<P>Bli&s;ters, volatiles, aromatics and wine, are of u&s;e in the remi&s;&s;ions of the fevers that prevail in the autumnal &s;ea&s;on in the &s;outh of Europe, as well as in the &s;outhern &s;tates of America, during every period of the di&s;ea&s;e. But in the northern &s;tates they are &s;eldom admi&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="5" REF="033590_0008_0FF793C4EF8B99B0">
till the vigor and ten&s;ion of the arterial &s;y&s;tem has been reduced by blood-letting, purging, refrigerating drinks, and ab&s;tinence.</P>
<P>Phy&s;icians &s;hould therefore always compare the cli|mate and &s;oil of the country where an author has been in habits of making his ob&s;ervations, with tho&s;e of his own, before he &s;ubmits to be governed by his rules or advice.&mdash;Unle&s;s he does this, he will be at a lo&s;s to know whether the practice of the author he may have occa&s;ion to con&s;ult, will apply to the di&s;ea&s;es where he re&s;ides or not.</P>
<P>It al&s;o requires great caution as well as di&s;cernment, to avoid being mi&s;led by the plau&s;ible theories of &s;pe|culative and fanciful authors. For in&s;tance, who, after reading in one of tho&s;e authors, that every fever owes its exi&s;tence and continuance to a &s;tate of debility; that it is aggravated by debilitating powers, and that purgatives of every &s;pecies are debilitating powers, would venture to employ a medicine of this cla&s;s, in the cure of any kind of fever? Yet in hot climates, where extreme and con&s;tant heat, and a variety of other circum&s;tances, are &s;aid to be con&s;tantly con&s;piring to encrea&s;e the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e (debility,) there is nothing more common, nothing more benefi|cial, than the frequent employment of mild purges in remitting bilious fevers.</P>
<P>Or who that reads, that a convul&s;ive &s;tate of the ar|teries is the proximate cau&s;e of every fever, whether, pe&s;tilential, typhus, intermittent, or remittent, and that copious blood-letting and purging are the be&s;t remedies in one variety of fever ari&s;ing from the &s;ame origin, viz. &s;timulus with all the other varieties, would he&s;itate to employ the &s;ame remedies without mea&s;ure or re|&s;erve, in every form that can po&s;&s;ibly occur.</P>
<P>Intermittent and remittent fevers, as well as fevers accompanied with local affections, are greatly influen|ced, not only by the climate and &s;oil, but by the &s;ea&s;on and &s;en&s;ible qualities of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Sir John Pringle remarks, that "In Holland towards June, (a healthy month;) Inflammatory fevers begin to recede, and that bilious remitting and malignant
<PB N="6" REF="033590_0009_0FF793C7A72F95F0">
fevers often &s;ucceed, and continue throughout the &s;um|mer and autumn, until the return of winter, when in|flammatory fevers recommence; the &s;ea&s;ons and di&s;|ea&s;es interchanging and running into each other."</P>
<P>Dr. Monro relates, that "The fir&s;t time he &s;aw much of the remitting fever in Germany, was about the end of June, &s;oon after the army took the field. At that time the remi&s;&s;ions were &s;hort, and the fever partook much of the nature of the common inflammatory fever, and mo&s;t of the &s;ick were cured by blood letting, and other antiphlogi&s;tic remedies.</P>
<P>"After the middle of June, the fever did not partake near &s;o much of the inflammatory nature as before;&mdash; the remi&s;&s;ions became much more evident, and it was attended much oftner in the beginning with bilious vomitting and purging, and in &s;ome few the di&s;order turned to a dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>"A few had it changed into a continued putrid fever, from the wards in one of the ho&s;pitals being too much crowded&mdash;and in &s;ome few it terminated in regu|lar agues. In November &s;everal were taken ill of the remitting fever in the garri&s;on of Bremen, which mo&s;tly ended in a regular intermittent, the endemic di&s;temper of the place."</P>
<P>"In June 1762, the remitting fever began to appear again among the troops at Natzungen, and continued to be frequent through the &s;ummer and autumn. The greate&s;t part terminated this year in regular agues, mo&s;tly in tertians, and were cured by the bark, whereas the year before, very few terminated this way."</P>
<P>(This is a clear proof of the influence of climate and &s;oil upon the con&s;titution, and of the power of con&s;ti|tution in modifying di&s;ea&s;e.) "Mo&s;t of tho&s;e ill of this fever, had a yellowi&s;h colour of the countenance, which went off with the fever; in &s;ome more ob&s;erva|ble than in others; in general it was &s;light; &s;ome few become yellow all over."</P>
<P>Dr. Pringle has al&s;o taken notice of this yellowne&s;s &s;ometimes occuring in ca&s;es of remitting fever, and re|marks, that it was found more frequent during the fir&s;t campaign, than afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033590_0010_0FF793C93AC82820">Dr. Lind, the mo&s;t experienced phy&s;ician of the pre|&s;ent age in febrile di&s;ea&s;es, relates, that "The years 1765 and 1766, were di&s;tingui&s;hed by an uncommon appearance of intermitting and remitting fevers in mo&s;t parts of England, one obvious cau&s;e of this was the unu&s;ual frequency of the ea&s;terly wind, (which con|trary to what it is in America is always dry and hot in that climate.)</P>
<P>"The year 1765 was remarkable, not only for the long continuance of ea&s;terly winds, but al&s;o for an ex|traordinary degree of heat: In the month of Augu&s;t, the thermometer was often as high as 82&deg; in the mid|dle of the day. This con&s;iderable addition of heat, to|gether with the want of refre&s;hing rains, greatly &s;pread this fever, increa&s;ed its violence, and in many ca&s;es changed its form.</P>
<P>"The violence of the fever, with its appearances in an intermitting, remitting, or a continued form, mark|ed as it were the nature of the &s;oil.&mdash;In Port&s;mouth, its &s;ymptoms were bad, wor&s;e at King&s;ton, and &s;till more violent and dangerous in a &s;treet called the half|way-hou&s;e, where the &s;ituation of the hou&s;es are low and damp.</P>
<P>"A con&s;tant pain and giddine&s;s of the head, were the mo&s;t in&s;eparable and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e: &s;ome were delirious; and a few vomitted up a quantity of bile, and in all, the countenance was yel|low. The univer&s;ality of this fever, together with its uncommon &s;ymptoms, were at fir&s;t alarming; but when the lancet was withheld, and the bark given ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tifully in large do&s;es few died.</P>
<P>"The di&s;ea&s;e decrea&s;ed with the heat of the weather, and in the <HI>winter</HI> appeared chiefly in the form of a quartan ague<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">(Lind on Di&s;ea&s;es of Hot Climates, Edit. 2d. p. 25.)</NOTE>."</P>
<P>We learn from the Ob&s;ervations of Dr. R. Jack&s;on in his treati&s;e on the Fevers of Jamaica, that the &s;ea&s;on of the year has con&s;iderable effect upon the diathe&s;is of the &s;y&s;tem, and con&s;equently upon the type, or form of
<PB N="8" REF="033590_0011_0FF793CB8DD1A8A0">
the fever, even within the tropics. Thus in the dry &s;ea&s;on (from December to April) though the remi&s;&s;ions are not always more perfect, the type is commonly more &s;imple, and the general diathe&s;is more inflamma|tory. In the rainy months, remi&s;&s;ions are more di&s;tinct, but the type is more complicated, and the general dia|the&s;is has a &s;trong tendency to putre&s;cency, and often with &s;ymptoms of nervous affection. The &s;tomach, bowels and liver, likewi&s;e &s;uffer more in this &s;ea&s;on than in the dryer months of the year. Be&s;ides this difference which ari&s;es from &s;ea&s;on, we al&s;o find very con&s;tant effects from local &s;ituation. Thus in hilly di&s;|tricts there is more of the inflammatory diathe&s;is, with more frequent determination to the head and lungs, and le&s;s di&s;tinct remi&s;&s;ions than in flat and champaign countries, where the &s;tomach and biliary &s;y&s;tem &s;uffer in a remarkable manner."</P>
<P>This effect of &s;ea&s;on and &s;oil, is &s;till more remarkable in the intermitting or remitting fever of the United States of America. In the &s;pring and beginning of &s;ummer, the double tertian or remitting fever, is the mo&s;t u&s;ual type of fever in the mar&s;hy tracts, and low grounds, in every part of the Union, and the remi&s;&s;ions are &s;hort and imperfect.</P>
<P>In the months of Augu&s;t and September, and part of October, quotidians, and fevers with very imperfect and ob&s;cure remi&s;&s;ions are more prevalent than any other forms or types. As the autumn advances, &s;ingle tertians and remittents, with inflammatory &s;ymptoms become mo&s;t prevalent.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the changes, produced in the type and &s;ymp|toms of fevers produced by the air of mar&s;hes, or the effluvia of putrefying vegetable &s;ub&s;tances by the change of &s;ea&s;on, and the condition of the &s;oil, climate has a con&s;iderable effect upon it&mdash;For on York-I&s;land, the type is generally, even in the heat of &s;ummer, &s;ingle tertian. In Georgia, the &s;ingle tertian is the prevailing type only in the winter and &s;pring.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer and part of autumn, double tertians are common; and types of a &s;till more complicated kind frequently make their appearance in certain &s;ituations
<PB N="9" REF="033590_0012_0FF793CFC780DA48">
of all the &s;outhern &s;tates. Dy&s;entery, drop&s;y, and fe|vers accompanied with malignant &s;ymptoms, are like|wi&s;e more frequent in the &s;outhern, than in the ea&s;tern or middle &s;tates; and the cour&s;e of the fever in the former in general, is more certainly checked in its early &s;tage by the Peruvian bark, than in the latter.</P>
<P>Virginia lies about half way between New-York and Savannah, and the general effects of its climate on the common endemic of the country, corre&s;ponds in a great mea&s;ure with its local &s;ituation.

<P>It has been, and is &s;till the opinion of &s;everal phy|&s;icians of re&s;pectability, not only in Philadelphia, but al&s;o in Baltimore, New York, and Bo&s;ton, that the contagious yellow fever which has prevailed during the &s;ummer and autumnal months, in &s;everal of the &s;ea|port towns of America, &s;ince the year 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, is the &s;ame in kind, differing only in degree with the common bi|lious remittent; and becau&s;e the &s;ea&s;on was dry, and uniformly warm when it prevailed at Philadelphia in 1793; its contagious quality was a&s;cribed to that cau&s;e, and when it prevailed at New York in 1795, becau&s;e the weather was remarkably wet at that time, it was as prepo&s;terou&s;ly a&s;cribed to that circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is not only rational to &s;uppo&s;e, but many facts favour the opinion, that when no other di&s;ea&s;e appears in the place where a contagious di&s;ea&s;e prevails, that the &s;ea&s;on or &s;en&s;ible qualities of the air, or exhalations from the &s;oil at that time, are not favourable to the ge|neration of the di&s;ea&s;es u&s;ually endemic at that &s;ea&s;on. It is impo&s;&s;ible that the contagion &s;hould have the ef|fect of bani&s;hing them, as it can have no effect upon the quality of the air, to any extent from the bodies of tho&s;e with the di&s;ea&s;e. Facts relative to the &s;tate of the weather at New York in the autumn of 1795, and at Philadelphia the pre&s;ent year, viz. 1797, which were wetter and cooler than many preceding &s;ea&s;ons had been, as well as tho&s;e contained in almo&s;t every mo|dern medical author, e&s;tabli&s;h this.</P>
<P>It is merely owing to a change in the &s;en&s;ible qua|lities of the air, or to the removal of the various efflu|via, or impurities with which it is occa&s;ionally mixed, that one epidemic &s;ucceeds or takes place of another,
<PB N="13" REF="033590_0016_0FF793D9CED6D7E8">
and not to the influence of one epidemic over another. For example: In the warm and impure air of autumn, when intermittents prevail, pleuri&s;ies are rare, but on the approach of winter the intermittents decline, and pleuri&s;ies increa&s;e. Is this owing to the influence of the one di&s;ea&s;e over the other, or is it owing to a change in the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the air? That fe|brile di&s;ea&s;es derived from contagion, and tho&s;e from mar&s;h effluvia, often prevail in the &s;ame place, and at the &s;ame time, is known to every per&s;on acquainted with medical hi&s;tory. Even Sydenham has recorded in&s;tances, (though they contradict his doctrine of occult cau&s;es) of &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es different in kind, being epi|demic in the &s;ame place at the &s;ame time <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Account of the Epidemic Con&s;titution of 1670, 71, and 72, at page 142, Edit. 3d. tran&s;lated by Swan.</NOTE>.

<P>When however I reflect that philo&s;ophy was only beginning to emerge from gothic darkne&s;s, in which it had long been &s;unk, at the time Sydenham publi&s;hed his ob&s;ervations; I am willing to make due allowance for his errors:&mdash;But the pre&s;ent aera, when philo&s;ophy has arrived at a &s;tate of improvement, which approaches to perfection, &s;uch errors are not entitled to the &s;ame toleration.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now tran&s;cribe a few remarks from other au|thorities, which will remove every doubt, that two con|tagious di&s;ea&s;es, different in kind, may prevail in the &s;ame place at the &s;ame time.

From the facts on record re|&s;pecting the plague, it appears that a certain range of temperature is requi&s;ite for the contagion, by which it is propagated, to operate: Hence it would appear that the pe&s;tilential contagion is attached to, and rendered volatile to a certain extent, by a certain quantity of ca|loric or matter of heat, or is attenuated and diffu&s;ed by the action of &s;en&s;ible heat, like water converted into va|pour, &s;o as to be &s;pecifically lighter than the air near the &s;urface of the ground.

<HEAD><HI>OF THE CAUSES</HI> OF BILIOUS FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the numerous ob&s;ervations which have been made in different quarters of the world, there can be no doubt, that the cau&s;e of the fevers under con&s;ideration, is a mia&s;ma or exhalation, which i&s;&s;ues from a mar&s;hy or putrid &s;oil, or from putrefying vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances. The &s;imilarity in the &s;ea&s;on, &s;ituation, and &s;oil, in the different countries and di&s;tricts in which the&s;e kind of fevers prevail, and e&s;|pecially the time of the year in which they are mo&s;t epidemic and dangerous, concur in proving that how|ever &s;ymptoms may vary in different &s;ituations and con&s;titutions, they ari&s;e from one common cau&s;e, and that cau&s;e is mia&s;ma.</P>
<P>This mia&s;ma is &s;uppo&s;ed to partake of the nature of the putrid &s;ource from whence it is derived, but what|ever its nature may be, it exi&s;ts in the atmo&s;phere over the &s;oil or putrefying &s;ub&s;tances, from whence it ari&s;es in various quantities, and perhaps degrees of &s;trength, according to the climate, &s;ea&s;on, temperature of the air, and quantity of putrid matter. Hence in tempe|rate climates in the hot &s;ea&s;on, it is in le&s;s quantity or in le&s;s &s;trength, than in hotter climates with a &s;imilar &s;oil. In hot climates al&s;o, the heat and impurity of the air, favours its operation, by inducing debility and pre|ternatural irritability in the animal &s;y&s;tem. In tempe|rate climates the difference between the temperature of
<PB N="18" REF="033590_0021_0FF793E7587162A0">
the air of the days and nights, render the body more e&s;pecially liable to be affected by febrile mia&s;mata.</P>
<P>Why the&s;e mia&s;mata when diffu&s;ed abroad in the at|mo&s;phere of mar&s;hy di&s;tricts, do not produce fever in all the inhabitants within the &s;phere of its influence, or why &s;ome are affected by it much later than others, can only be explained by &s;uppo&s;ing that it can only operate on relaxed, infirm, or debilitated con&s;titutions, and that &s;ome debilitating cau&s;e mu&s;t con&s;pire with it, before it can produce any morbid effect in vigorous and robu&s;t con&s;titutions. This appears to be confirm|ed by its effects on the emigrants from Ireland, which generally arrive in this country the beginning of Au|gu&s;t. Very few are affected with either the remitting or intermitting fever the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on, though numbers are with the dy&s;entery, whereas very few of tho&s;e that take up their re&s;idence in the &s;uburbs of Philadelphia, e&s;cape it the &s;econd or third &s;ea&s;on after their arrival: but many are affected the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on of their arrival with infflammatory fever, e&s;pecially if the &s;ea&s;on be dry and hot,&mdash;if wet and cool, the dy&s;entery. This is al&s;o the ca&s;e with per&s;ons who come to re&s;ide in the city, from the we&s;tern and hilly parts of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>Mud and &s;tagnant water in every climate, po&s;&s;e&s;s the materials which give origin to the cau&s;e of this &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e; but a combination of other circum&s;tances is requi&s;ite to give it activity. Among the principal of the circum&s;tances which give activity to this cau&s;e, may be reckoned the influence of a powerful &s;un. Hence &s;ome &s;ituations, which in the winter &s;ea&s;on are di&s;tingui&s;hed for no particular di&s;ea&s;e, are ob&s;erved in the hot months to be mo&s;t remarkably unhealthful.</P>
<P>There are few men who&s;e ob&s;ervations are &s;o circum|&s;cribed, as not to know, that it is in the neighbourhood of &s;wamps, mill-dams, and near the &s;hores of fre&s;h water rivers, that intermittents and remittents chiefly prevail; yet it de&s;erves likewi&s;e to be remarked, that though a fever of one of the&s;e forms is mo&s;t prevalent in &s;uch &s;ituations, no champaign or level country is en|tirely exempt from them, e&s;pecially when wet &s;um|mers are &s;ucceeded by dry and &s;ultry autumns.</P>

<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, (and the &s;uppo&s;ition was adopt|ed by the celebrated Dr. Cullen,) to po&s;&s;e&s;s a <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eptic Principle,</HI> but this alone is by no means &s;ufficient, to ac|count for the very peculiar manner in which it affects the human race. Some other quality perhaps is there|fore connected with it, which cannot be brought under the in&s;pection of our &s;en&s;es. But though the ingenuity of the human mind, has not hitherto been able to pene|trate the intimate nature of this cau&s;e of fever, we &s;till have it in our power to trace its effects upon the human con&s;titution.</P>
<P>We plainly perceive that a habitual expo&s;ure to it, is peculiarly unfriendly to the <HI>principle</HI> of <HI>life,</HI> and in a very remarkable manner, &s;hortens the period of ex|i&s;tence. Hence, as recorded by Dr. Jack&s;on, while fe|males born, and con&s;tantly re&s;iding in the the low lands of Georgia, have &s;eldom been ob&s;erved to live beyond the age of forty, males &s;eldom exceed fifty, whereas Eu|ropeans or Americans from the northern &s;tates, who had arrived at manhood before they &s;ettled there, have &s;ometimes lived to a very advanced age, though the majority of new &s;ettlers have died, of what is called a &s;ea&s;oning to the climate, the fir&s;t or &s;econd year after their arrival.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e and other in&s;tances which will occur to every ones recollection, afford &s;ufficient proofs of the

<P>Floods of rain, by diluting and precipitating putrid exhalations, relieve from the remitting bilious fevers, common to mar&s;hy &s;ituations; but rain has no effect upon the yellow fever, except when joined with cold, or &s;ucceeded by fro&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>AN EXAMINATION OF THE <HI>EVIDENCES RESPECTING THE</HI> CONTAGIOUS NATURE OF INTERMITTENT <HI>&amp;</HI> REMITTENT FEVERS</HEAD>
<P>IT has been &s;aid that it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to open a practical book on medical &s;ubjects, without meeting with facts which e&s;tabli&s;h the opinion, that fevers occa&s;ioned by the exhalations from putrid vegetables are contagious. The fevers generated by putrid cabbage, mentioned by Dr. Rodgers, and by putrid flax men|tioned by Dr. Zimmerman, were both of them con|tagious. Lanci&s;i, Reverius, Bianchi, Cleghorn, Lind of Wind&s;or, and Clark, have al&s;o been quoted in &s;up|port of this opinion.&mdash;All of which &s;hall be noticed in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>That Dr. Rodgers of Cork, was deceived with re&s;|&s;pect to the origin of the fever which broke out at Wadham College, is rendered more than probable by the ob&s;ervations of the celebrated Lind of Ha&s;lar Ho&s;|pital. This author informs us in his E&s;&s;ay on Fevers and Infection, page 290, that almo&s;t all the ca&s;es of fever which occur at academies and boarding-&s;chools are derived from infection; and that mo&s;t ca&s;es of low fever which occur in private families are derived from the &s;ame &s;ource. Dr. Cullen has expre&s;&s;ed a &s;imilar opi|nion, which has been adopted by Robert&s;on, Clark, Fer|riar, and a numerous ho&s;t of authors of the fir&s;t rate abilities.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="033590_0027_0FF793F5B5CD5C78">Dr. Zimmerman appears to have confounded epide|mic with contagious di&s;ea&s;es; nor &s;hould this be thought extraordinary, for notwith&s;tanding his abilities and cha|racter, he has been frequently mi&s;taken in his opinion re&s;pecting the remote cau&s;es of other di&s;ea&s;es. Among other mi&s;takes, he &s;ays the &s;curvy is propagated by con|tagion,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Experience in Phy&s;ic, page 125 of Vol. 2nd.</NOTE> and that putrid fevers are occa&s;ioned by the exhalations from putrid animal &s;ub&s;tances, and the plague at Grand Cairo, by the &s;tench from &s;warms of dead and putrid gra&s;shoppers and locu&s;ts.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mead on the Plague, &s;ays it originates from heat and moi&s;|ture, acting on dead animal matter, which is al&s;o erroneous. In the Ea&s;t, says he, it can be generated in this manner, but not in the temperate climates of Europe. If that were the ca&s;e the di&s;|ea&s;e would be propagated by the atmo&s;phere, to a certain extent, to numbers at once, and not from one to another in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</NOTE></P>
<P>Lanci&s;i who was phy&s;ician to Pope Clement XI. was &s;o much mi&s;taken in the real cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, that he a&s;cribed the pe&s;tilence which prevailed more or le&s;s at Grand Cairo annually, to the effluvia of hemp and flax, which happened to be &s;tored in granaries near that city, at a time when the di&s;ea&s;e was more general than u&s;ual; he has al&s;o a&s;cribed a fever which depopulated one end of Rome, to the putrid effluvia from <HI>hor&s;es lit|ter</HI> or &s;table dung.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1&s;t. page 350.</NOTE></P>
<P>That the plague never originates in that way, but is derived from &s;pecific contagion, generated in the cities of the Ea&s;t, is clearly &s;hown in Mead's Short Di&s;cour&s;e on the Plague, publi&s;hed in the year 1721, and in Ru&s;&s;el's treati&s;e on the &s;ame, publi&s;hed in the year 1791. The other opinion of Lanci&s;i, viz. that one end of Rome was depopulated by a fever, which originated from the putrid effluvia of hor&s;es litter, &amp;c. Profe&s;&s;or Ru&s;h has refu&s;ed in the 2nd Vol. of the American Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, page 211 and 212: The&s;e are his words. "Offal matters, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are of a vegetable nature, &s;hould be removed from the

On the contrary, to repay the hu&s;bandman for affording &s;helter to the&s;e <HI>u&s;eful</HI> and <HI>helple&s;s</HI> animals; nature has done more: She has endowed their dung with a power of de&s;troy|ing the effects of mar&s;h exhalations, and of preventing fevers. The mi&s;erable cottagers in Europe who live under the &s;ame roof, and in &s;ome in&s;tances in the &s;ame room with their cattle are always healthy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is this owing to the dung of tho&s;e animals, or to the purity of the air from other &s;ources, counteracting or de&s;troying the pu|tre&s;cent quality of the&s;e exhalations?</NOTE> In Phila|delphia, fevers are le&s;s known in the neighbourhood of livery &s;tables, than in any other part of the city. I could mention a family that has lived near thirty years near a livery &s;table, in a &s;ickly part of the city, that has never known a fever but from the &s;mall pox or mea&s;les."</P>
<P>Dr. Zimmerman has indeed &s;aid, that "the effluvia from a little heap of flax has been known to occa&s;ion a malignant fever, which proved fatal to the family in which it began, and afterwards &s;pread its contagion through a whole country." But it does not appear from this paragraph, whether he meant that the exha|lation from the flax, or the fever from the family &s;pread its contagion through a whole country. This can only be determined by reference to the original, which I have not had an opportunity of examining, and it is &s;eldom that a tran&s;lation conveys the preci&s;e meaning of the author. He has not mentioned whether the di&s;ea&s;e, which he &s;ays was occa&s;ioned by the exhala|tions from the putrid flax, attacked a number at the &s;ame time, or in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as they came within the &s;phere of contagion, that is within &s;ix or eight feet of the patient, for it has been a&s;certained by Dr. Haygath of Che&s;ter, that even the contagion of the &s;mall pox is
<PB N="26" REF="033590_0029_0FF793FB0AAF9498">
innoxious at that di&s;tance, where a free circulation of air is pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>If the facts mentioned by Dr. Zimmerman were true, the human race might literally work out their &s;alvation with fear and trembling, &s;ince none of woman born, could po&s;&s;ibly &s;urvive one hot &s;ummer; for al|though, "a little heap of putrid flax," &s;hould be want|ing, there are always apples rotting on the ground, putrid cabbage in the garden, turnips, potatoes, onions, or other vegetables in vaults or cellars,&mdash;and bilge water on &s;hipboard.</P>
<P>As to Dr. Rogers it appears evident that he did not know the difference between contagious, and epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, for he has a&s;cribed the former to cau&s;es which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> only produce epidemics or &s;poradics, and not con|tagious ones. The fevers which prevailed annually at Cork, he &s;ays were owing to the exhalations of the putrid blood from the &s;laughter-hou&s;es, particularly after the &s;ummer rains; whereas it is well known (for it has been often ob&s;erved) that &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es are com|mon in all damp &s;ituations in the autumnal &s;ea&s;on, where there are no &s;laughter-hou&s;es. The healthine&s;s of the generality of butcher's families, is oppo&s;ed to his opinion, as well as the healthine&s;s of the manufac|turers of &s;tarch and indigo, where vegetable putrefac|tion greatly abounds, is to that of vegetable putrefaction occa&s;ioning malignant, much le&s;s contagious fevers in &s;ituations open to the free introduction of the &s;urround|ing air. Unreflecting credulity,&mdash;like Shake&s;pear's Glendower, is always ready to a&s;cribe &s;imple events to extraordinary cau&s;es. At my birth, &s;ays Glendower, &s;trange phaenomena appeared; comets, eclip&s;es, and rock|ing of the firmament. Percy to ridicule his vain credulity and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, an&s;wers, that all the&s;e phaenomena might al&s;o have happened at the birth of a kitten: Meaning that there could be no connection between &s;uch phaenomena, and the birth of mortals. Phy|&s;icians are too often apt to attribute the cau&s;e of things to &s;ome circum&s;tance mo&s;t obvious to their &s;en&s;es, or to &s;ome remarkable circum&s;tance in, or phaenomenon which accompanies or preceeds any
<PB N="27" REF="033590_0030_0FF793FC9D8023A8">
di&s;ea&s;e; and for want of tracing all the circum&s;tances to their &s;ource, mi&s;take effects or coincidents for cau&s;es. Thus in the year 1699, when the yellow fever cea&s;ed upon the coming on of fro&s;t, becau&s;e Roger Gill a preacher had offered him&s;elf &s;ome time before, as a &s;acrifice for the people, and &s;oon after died, with others expo&s;ed to the contagion, it was generally a&s;cribed to a &s;pecial interpo&s;ition of Providence, in&s;tead of being a&s;cribed to the effect of fro&s;t, which was the phy&s;ical cau&s;e of its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. I once &s;aw a bodkin thru&s;t through a hen's head, &s;ome of the bal&s;am of Riga was applied, the hen walked about &s;oon after, and appeared to recover by the virtue of that bal&s;am. Another hen with a bodkin thru&s;t through her head, to which no bal&s;am was applied, did the &s;ame and detected the cheat.</P>
<P>A medical profe&s;&s;or, &s;ays, that Dr. Lind a&s;cribes the yellow fever to vegetable exhalations, but I can find no &s;uch &s;entiment in any of Lind's works. His words are (in his Treati&s;e of Di&s;ea&s;es of Hot Climates, page 119&mdash;5th Edition.) This fever in general proceeds from inten&s;e heat, and a peculiar unhealthfulne&s;s of the air, but he does not &s;ay how that unhealthfulne&s;s of the air is produced. What he has &s;aid re&s;pecting the effects of unwhole&s;ome air at Greenwich ho&s;pital in Jamaica, has no other reference to the &s;ubject, than that every kind of fever is ag|gravated by &s;uch air, page 179, 5th Edition. The fact is, that Dr. Lind was not acquainted with the &s;ource of this fever, but mi&s;took it for a higher grade of the bilious remittent fever, rendered &s;o by a peculiar unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the air; but unlucki|ly for the&s;e opinions, there are no in&s;tances of a bilious fever becoming contagious, nor one authen|tic in&s;tance where the di&s;ea&s;e under con&s;ideration ever occurred in any &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, without the concurrence of &s;pecific contagion.&mdash;For proof of this, I refer to the facts contained in Hillary's Di&s;ea&s;es of Barbadoes, not to his &s;peculative opinions; Gough's Hi&s;tory of the Friends; to Dr. Mitchel's Let|ter to Dr. Franklin; to Lind on Infection; to Lin|ings

Account of its &s;everal occurrences at Charle&s;ton, in 1732, 1739&mdash;45 and&mdash;48, where it was each time traced to importation, and when &s;ome of the &s;ea&s;ons in which it occurred, were both cooler and wetter than many which had intervened, or preceded them. The fact is, Lind knew nothing about the di&s;ea&s;e but from the report of others, otherwi&s;e he would not have pub|li&s;hed an extract of a letter from Dr. N. Smith to op|po&s;e the opinion of its being contagious. (See his E&s;&s;ay on the means of pre&s;erving the health of &s;eamen, &amp;c.) If Lind was right in his opinion, the di&s;ea&s;e he &s;peaks of could not be the &s;ame as the one which pre|vailed in the We&s;t India I&s;lands, as well as in Philadel|phia, in 1793; for it was highly contagious in both places. And in the We&s;t Indies affected the natives, as well as foreigners. Not with&s;tanding the po&s;itive manner in which the other, Dr. Lind, (now of Wind&s;or) who was &s;urgeon to a little &s;loop of war, in the &s;ervice of the Ea&s;t India Company, has decided on the que&s;tion, his opportunities were too unfavourable, and his ob&s;er|vations too limited to determine a que&s;tion of this na|ture.</P>
<P>Dr. Cleghorn has &s;aid, that tertians have as good a right to be called contagious, as the mea&s;les or &s;mall pox, but as he has not mentioned any facts in &s;upport of his a&s;&s;ertion, it can only be con&s;idered as mere mat|ter of opinion, derived perhaps from hear&s;ay, or the <HI>Ip&s;e dixit</HI> of &s;ome profe&s;&s;or learned in antient error.</P>
<P>It would be mere wa&s;te of time, to employ my pen again&s;t &s;uch authors as Riverius and Bianchi. Works publi&s;hed when fair &s;cience was only beginning to dawn, claim compa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>"The Grenville Indiaman which touched at the I&s;land of Java, &s;uffered greatly from the malignity of the air.

I vi&s;it|ed &s;everal (adds our author,) when &s;he arrived at China, who were reduced to mere &s;keletons by the duration of the fever and the dy&s;entery, both of which were mo&s;t cer|tainly propagated by contagion."</P>
<P>From Dr. Clark's mentioning his having vi&s;ited &s;e|veral in this &s;hip, after her arrival at <HI>China,</HI> it appears that he was not on board of her at the time he &s;ays "the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread by contagion at &s;ea," of cour&s;e he could not determine with certainty, whether the di&s;ea&s;e was contagious or not.</P>

<P>Dr. R. Jack&s;on in his late Treati&s;e on the intermitting fever of America, a&s;&s;ures us that fevers produced by the air of mar&s;hes, (or the exhalations from putrid ve|getable <HI>&s;ub&s;tances</HI>) &s;eldom if ever make their attack in le&s;s than &s;even days after &s;uch expo&s;ure, and that &s;ome have been as long even as twenty days after &s;uch expo|&s;ure, before the was fever completely formed.</P>
<P>To &s;upport the opinion which he appears to have adopted from Dr. Cleghorn, that common intermit|tents are contagious; Dr. Clark informs us, that an <HI>old lady</HI> with the pal&s;y, who lived up three pair of &s;tairs, in a &s;ituation where no mar&s;h mia&s;mata could reach her, was attacked with an ague, and as there was no &s;ource of mar&s;h mia&s;ma, from whence it could have originated it mu&s;t have been occa&s;ioned by contagion. But from whom &s;he received the contagion he has not &s;aid.</P>
<P>From this ca&s;e it appears that Dr. Clark thought, no ca&s;e of <HI>ague</HI> could take place in any &s;ituation, or from any circum&s;tance, unle&s;s the per&s;on affected had been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to mar&s;h exhalation, or to the effluvia of a per&s;on labouring under the di&s;ea&s;e. A mi&s;take which is unpardonable in an author, who pretends to write for the in&s;truction of others.</P>
<P>The fact however is very different from what Dr. Clark has &s;uppo&s;ed, for there are a multiplicity of ob|&s;ervations upon record, which as well as my own ob|&s;ervations, convince me that intermittents often occur in <HI>&s;ituations</HI> excluded both from mar&s;hes and &s;ick <HI>per|&s;ons,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="033590_0034_0FF79406DBD434E0">
where patients, after being debilitated by any acute di&s;ea&s;e, fall into regular intermittents from ex|po&s;ure to the night air, when the dews are copious, or after a &s;udden change of weather from dry and hot to wet and cold.&mdash;Perhaps this was the ca&s;e with Dr. Clark's patient who was debilitated by a chronic di&s;|ea&s;e. We are al&s;o told by Dr. Clark, that a decrepid and infirm gentleman, and his &s;ervant maid were both attacked by an intermittent, for which no cau&s;e could be a&s;&s;igned, but the vi&s;it of another maid &s;ervant from the country. He knew a child take the ague from be|ing much conver&s;ant with a per&s;on troubled with that di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;"And a man from only vi&s;iting a friend while &s;weating in a tertian." Since the year 1788, adds Dr. Clark, "I have &s;een &s;ix in&s;tances of agues communi|cated from one to another by contagion in the wards of the infirmary at New-Ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>The&s;e may appear unequivocal proofs of the conta|gious nature of intermittent and remittent fevers, to per&s;ons not aware of the changes which the &s;tate of the mind, the &s;ituation of place, and the change of living, as well as the propen&s;ity to imitation, (which prevails in mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es attended with nervous &s;ymptoms,) have upon the human body.</P>

<P>The phy&s;icians of New York, who have written on the malignant yellow fever, which prevailed in that city in the year 1795, and de&s;troyed the lives of near one thou&s;and of the inhabitants; are decidedly oppo&s;ed to the opinion, that bilious fevers are contagious, as is evident from their denying that the yellow fever was contagious; which they &s;uppo&s;ed was only a higher grade of the common bilious fever, which prevails there more or le&s;s at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on every year, and which they a&s;cribe to the effluvia of the mud and &s;tagnant water of the flats and docks.</P>

that "(they are not naturally or nece&s;&s;arily contagious, but may become &s;o after they have in &s;ome mea&s;ure changed their nature."</P>
<P>This is certainly in effect giving up the point, for a di&s;ea&s;e changed in its nature, is no longer the &s;ame that it was originally, but a new di&s;ea&s;e. If they are not changed in their nature, and are contagious, they mu&s;t propagate a fever of the &s;ame character and type with them&s;elves. But every ca&s;e of fever which originates from febrile contagion, exhibits the type and character of the typhus or continued fever, with nervous or pu|trid &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>When the attendants on patients with an intermitting or remitting fever are attacked with a fever of a conti|nued type, and nervous or putrid &s;ymptoms, it implies, not that tho&s;e fevers are contagious, but that a conta|gious matter has been generated, accumulated, and ren|dered active, in con&s;equence of the &s;ituation and circum|&s;tances of the &s;ick: For it has been often experienced, that contagion has been generated in con&s;equence of the confinement of healthy per&s;ons in &s;ituations where the air is confined till it becomes &s;aturated with the effluvia i&s;&s;uing from their bodies, which are thereby converted into contagion. But this contagion produces a fever of a continued type, and an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;ymp|toms which di&s;tingui&s;h it from every other genus, and propagates a fever of the &s;ame type and a&s;&s;emblage of &s;ymptoms from one to another. But remittents do not produce their likene&s;s to per&s;ons expo&s;ed to their influ|ence; therefore as remittents they are not contagious.</P>
<P>To conclude, if fevers become contagious and are communicated from one to another, the di&s;ea&s;e caught being &s;imilar to the one from which it took its origin; it may be inferred that they depend upon a &s;pecific and unaltered contagion,&mdash;but if a per&s;on takes a fever from another, different from the original di&s;ea&s;e, it &s;hews that a &s;pecific contagion has been generated, en|tirely different from that by which the original di&s;ea&s;e was produced.</P>

and unventilated &s;ituations, I do not pretend to deny, but I contend that the contagion &s;o generated is of a &s;pecific kind, entirely unconnected with the in|termittent and remittent fever, otherwi&s;e it would oc|ca&s;ion in tho&s;e expo&s;ed to it, a fever of an intermittent or remittent form; but in&s;tead of this it always occa|&s;ions a fever of a continued form capable of being com|municated in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from one to another.</P>
<P>That the contagion generated by patients labouring under the recited di&s;ea&s;es is not connected with tho&s;e &s;pecies of fever, but entirely independent of them ap|pears to be rendered certain from the very &s;ame kind of contagion being frequently generated in &s;imilar &s;itua|tions, by per&s;ons entirely free from every kind of fever.</P>

<P>Recent and accurate ob&s;ervations have not only con|vinced me, that febrile contagion is always derived from the living human body, in &s;ituations deprived of a due proportion of oxygen or pure air; but that the con|tagion is rendered more virulent and deleterious in pro|portion to the extent and duration of the heat to which people in &s;uch &s;ituations are expo&s;ed. This is confirmed by the Account of the Origin of the Yellow Fever, which appeared in the I&s;land of Grenada, in the be|ginning of the year 1793, publi&s;hed by Dr. Chi&s;holm.

they acted as direct &s;timulants, and occa&s;ioned inflam|matory affections, which were not preceded by &s;ymp|toms of debility, and which are, entirely different from the effects produced by febrile contagion.</P>
<P>Let us now advert to the que&s;tion, relative to the malignant fever being only a higher grade of the com|mon bilious fever which derives its origin from the ef|fluvia of mar&s;hes or putrid vegetable matter. Though it be difficult to convey preci&s;ely in words a de&s;cription of the &s;ymptoms which di&s;tingui&s;h the one di&s;ea&s;e from the other; their di&s;criminating marks not con&s;i&s;ting &s;o much in one or two &s;ymptoms, as in a certain a&s;&s;em|blage of &s;everal, yet when the whole of the &s;ymptoms of each are compared jointly and &s;everally, the difference is exceedingly clear and evident.</P>

Dr. Jack&s;on ob&s;erves, that though the yellow fever appears variou&s;ly in per|&s;ons of different con&s;titutions or diathe&s;es, from its fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion, it may generally be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the endemic remittent of the country, not only by the ob|&s;curene&s;s of the remi&s;&s;ions, but likewi&s;e by a certain ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the eye and countenance, with &s;omething unu&s;ually di&s;agreeable in the feelings, of which words convey an imperfect idea.</P>

<P>But the yellow fever does not differ from the bilious fever, only in the circum&s;tance of contagion, and in the a&s;pect and &s;everity of its &s;ymptoms; it differs from it al&s;o by its &s;ymptoms being rendered wor&s;e, by &s;ome of the remedies which are mo&s;t efficacious in the cure of the bilious fever.&mdash;Nor are the&s;e the only circum|&s;tances in which the&s;e fevers are di&s;&s;imilar: The bilious fever occupies more e&s;pecially mar&s;hy di&s;tricts, where the inhabitants re&s;ide at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from one another, and invades a number at the &s;ame time; its cau&s;e being mixed with a con&s;iderable portion of the atmo&s;phere, and its influence &s;ometimes extending more than a mile from its &s;ource; it is al&s;o more or le&s;s endemic in &s;uch &s;ituations at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on annu|ally.</P>
<P>Whereas the yellow fever never appears among the the inhabitants of mar&s;hy countries in temperate cli|mates, but in &s;uch climates, when it does occur, is al|ways confined to &s;ea-port towns, where, on its fir&s;t oc|currence
<PB N="43" REF="033590_0046_0FF79426067C6E50">
it has always been traced to one contracted &s;pot near to &s;ome wharf, or foul ve&s;&s;el.&mdash;If it originated from the &s;ame cau&s;e as the bilious remittent, every part of the town, where it occurs, would be alike &s;ubject to the di&s;ea&s;e, at the &s;ame time, or within a few days of each other.&mdash;Some would be &s;eized in the north and &s;outh, &s;ome in the ea&s;t and we&s;t, the centre and cir|cumference, at the &s;ame time; but in&s;tead of this, the malignant yellow fever every time that it has occurred in this city, (and it has occurred only five times in|cluding the pre&s;ent year, in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent century, and once before, that we have any account of on record or have learned from popular tradition,) has always made its fir&s;t appearance in one circum&s;crib|ed point, and fir&s;t affected a few individuals who re&s;ided near, or tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s at that particular point, while every other part of the city has continued perfectly heal|thy, until the di&s;ea&s;e has had time to &s;pread it&s;elf by contagion. From tho&s;e circum&s;tances, it is evident that the &s;eeds of the di&s;order do not float in, or mix with the atmo&s;phere to any extent, but mu&s;t be &s;ought for in &s;ome other &s;ource.</P>
<P>If we go down to the meadows and mar&s;hes on the flats of the Delaware and the Schuylkill, and look for it among the di&s;ea&s;es, which exhalations engender, it is not there. Imagination, and her whim&s;ical daugh|ter, <HI>Theory,</HI> have created &s;omething in tho&s;e places, which they have called its likene&s;s; but, the <HI>Sallow Imp</HI> of the mar&s;hes, is the offspring of different parents, and differs e&s;&s;entially in its character from the jaundice-eyed fiend, which extends its de&s;tructive &s;way by con|tagion. If we look for it, in the effluvia from the gut|ters of the &s;treets, the heaps of unmole&s;ted dirt, in the alleys and lanes, the mud and litter with which the wharfs and water &s;treet is too often encumbered, it &s;till eludes our &s;earch.

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE <HI>BILIOUS REMITTING</HI> FEVER, AS IT USUALLY APPEARS IN PHILADELPHIA, IN SUMMER <HI>AND AUTUMN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN this fever though there is not a com|plete intermi&s;&s;ion or ce&s;&s;ation of the febrile &s;ymptoms, there is an abatement or remi&s;&s;ion more or le&s;s evident once in the cour&s;e of every twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>This fever after being preceded for a day or two, and &s;ometimes much longer by a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;e of languor and debility, u&s;ually attacks between eight and eleven o'clock in the morning with a chilly fit, which after a longer or &s;horter duration, is accompanied with or &s;ucceeded by the following &s;ymptoms. Alternate &s;en&s;ations of cold and heat, darting and thrilling through the back and limbs, acute pain in the fore part of the head, back and limbs, yawning, &s;tretching, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, con&s;tant thir&s;t, dryne&s;s and clammine&s;s of tongue, mouth, and fauces, flatulency, nau&s;ea, and frequent at|tempts to puke, &s;ometimes bringing up bilious matter, and &s;ometimes voiding it by &s;tool. In many ca&s;es the cold &s;tage is accompanied with cholera; in others, e&s;pe|cially when the fever attacks per&s;ons of a phlogi&s;tic diathe&s;is, or &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed to local inflammation, it
<PB N="46" REF="033590_0049_0FF7942E3A366F70">
is attended with co&s;tivene&s;s. In the&s;e ca&s;es however the patient generally has a call to the chair before the commencement of the &s;econd paroxi&s;m. The urine during the cold &s;tage is pale, copious and crude; but as &s;oon as the hot &s;tage is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and during its height it becomes high coloured, and during the remi&s;&s;ion appears thick and cloudy and &s;ometimes de|po&s;its a brick-coloured or browni&s;h mucous &s;ediment. During the continuance of the hot &s;tage, there is al|ways a &s;en&s;e of tightne&s;s and unea&s;ine&s;s about the tho|rax and &s;tomach, and more or le&s;s frequency and unea&s;ine&s;s in re&s;piration. As the hot &s;tage advances the pul&s;e (which during the preceding &s;tage was low, &s;mall, quick, contracte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and irregular) becomes freer, fuller, &s;tronger; the temporal and carotid arteries throb; the face becomes &s;uffu&s;ed with a &s;carlet blu&s;h; the mu&s;cles of the face dimini&s;hed during the cold &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, now be|come larger than in health; the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in &s;hrunk, rough, pale and dry before, now becomes di&s;tended and &s;mooth. The &s;ickne&s;s and propen&s;ity to puke &s;o con&s;tant and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing during the cold &s;tage, and al&s;o during the conflict between the cold and the hot &s;tages, before the latter becomes completely e&s;tabli&s;hed, now cea&s;es; and about four o'clock in the morning &s;ometimes two or three hours &s;ooner, but oftner an hour or two later, all the feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms begin to remit and continue to decline till the hour of the fir&s;t attack: Then the &s;ame proce&s;s is again renewed and the fever runs the &s;ame cour&s;e as the preceding day; and &s;o on every day till it entirely cea&s;es, becomes an intermittent or degenerates into a continued form.</P>
<P>After the &s;econd paroxi&s;m, and &s;ometimes after the fir&s;t the fever is &s;eldom preceded by a cold &s;tage, but comes on with &s;en&s;e of languor, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, flu&s;hings of heat, an increa&s;e of thir&s;t, and &s;ome nau&s;ea, or fla|tulence at &s;tomach, and the fever generally continues moderate till four or five o'clock in the afternoon, when it becomes more violent and continues in that &s;tate till the morning. In &s;ome ca&s;es this fever is wor&s;e every &s;econd day. It al&s;o &s;ometimes makes its fir&s;t at|tack in the evening. In tho&s;e ca&s;es the paroxi&s;ms are
<PB N="47" REF="033590_0050_0FF7942FD51F5170" MS="y">
generally longer, and the remi&s;&s;ions more ob&s;cure than when it attacks, or when its paroxi&s;ms are renewed in the morning.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es at the beginning of the fever, &s;tomach &s;ickne&s;s accompanied with vomiting and di&s;charges of bile from the bowels is &s;o predomninant, e&s;pecially in children who&s;e &s;y&s;tems are extremely irritable during the &s;ea&s;on when remittents prevail, in con&s;equence of the &s;ummer's heat, and often from the effects of teething, that many phy&s;icians, have &s;uppo&s;ed, that a redundancy and depraved &s;tate of that fluid was the principal cau&s;e of the fever, and in infants have confounded it with the cholera infantum: This is, however, a very great error, for vo|miting, by whatever means excited, if often repeated, with violent efforts, &s;carcely ever fails of forcing bile from the biliary ducts, and &s;ometimes in enormous quantities. An extraordinary &s;ecretion of bile in this fever, and in every other, is the effect of great irrita|bility of the &s;tomach, in conjunction with a defect of power in the circulating ve&s;&s;els on the &s;urface of the body; the con&s;equence of which is, a preternatural de|termination to the vena cava, liver, &amp;c. and of cour&s;e the cretion of an extraordinary quantity of bile in a given time.</P>
<P>During the exacerbation of the fever, there is always more or le&s;s, head ach, and pain in the back and limbs, and in many ca&s;es delirium, accompanied with much re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s. The face and eyes al&s;o appear more tur|gid and lively; the tongue appears at fir&s;t whiti&s;h and moi&s;t, or lightly tinged with a &s;treak of yellow. But when the fever has continued for &s;everal days, with an increa&s;e of debility, it becomes covered with a dark, brown, tough and dry cru&s;t. In &s;ome ca&s;es, great pro|&s;tration of &s;trength is vi&s;ible from the beginning, in others, it decrea&s;es gradually in the cour&s;e of the fever. The thir&s;t varies with the ri&s;e and fall of the fever, a bitter ta&s;te is common; a diarrhoea is more frequent than co&s;tivene&s;s&mdash;the colour of the urine varies with the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and decline of the <HI>paroxi&s;m</HI>: At the commence|ment of the paroxi&s;m it is pale, thin and copious, at the height it is high coloured, &s;canty and cloudy, at the de|cline
<PB N="48" REF="033590_0051_0FF79431C0821C98">
it is &s;till high coloured, but very turbid, and lets fall a &s;ediment; the heat of the &s;kin, al&s;o varies with each &s;tage the of paroxi&s;m.</P>
<P>When the di&s;ea&s;e has continued for &s;everal days with encrea&s;ing debility, it is common for the &s;kin and eyes, to become heavy dull and yellow, and the countenance to appear gha&s;tly. In tho&s;e circum&s;tances, the pul&s;e is always weak and exceedingly quick, and the mind af|fected with delirium of the low kind, commonly called typhomania.&mdash;When the di&s;ea&s;e has continued without abatement, and e&s;pecially when the pro&s;tration of &s;trength has become very con&s;iderable, the &s;ymptoms frequently become &s;o much diver&s;ified in different patients, that the inexperienced, are apt to &s;u&s;pect them to labour under different di&s;ea&s;es; &s;ome are co&s;tive, others have a con|&s;tant diarrhoea; &s;ome are chilled by every pa&s;&s;ing gale, while others are refre&s;hed by the colde&s;t air; the &s;kin of &s;ome is con&s;tantly parched with heat, while others are as con&s;tantly bathed in &s;weat.&mdash;But &s;ymptoms com|mon to almo&s;t all at a late period of di&s;ea&s;e, are a low, quick pul&s;e, gha&s;tly countenance, &s;unk eyes, continual heat and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, with &s;ickne&s;s, faintne&s;s, and pro|&s;tration of &s;trength, at the u&s;ual time of the acce&s;&s;ion of every fre&s;h paroxi&s;m; and this &s;ickne&s;s, and increa&s;e of debility, generally la&s;ts from morning till evening, and frequently all night, particularly, every &s;econd or third day; after which, there is generally &s;ome abatement of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and alarming &s;ymptoms for &s;ome hours.&mdash;If the debility &s;till continues to increa&s;e, the the pul&s;e becomes weaker, lower, &s;maller, quicker and more irregular, through every &s;tage of the paroxi&s;m, and the remi&s;&s;ions become no longer di&s;cernable, except by greater pro&s;tration of &s;trength, anxiety and re&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s at one time of the day, (generally about noon) than another. The days on which this fever u&s;ually terminates in health, are the 5th. 7th. 9th. 11th. and 13th. The&s;e are al&s;o the days on which the remi&s;&s;ions are mo&s;t manife&s;t. When this fever terminates favoura|bly, the remi&s;&s;ions become more di&s;tinct, accompanied with a warm moi&s;ture on the &s;kin, and a copious &s;edi|ment in the urine, an intermi&s;&s;ion then &s;ucceeds, and
<PB N="49" REF="033590_0052_0FF794382B2960A0">
&s;trength gradually returns. In many ca&s;es it terminates unfavourably without the aid of art, but in the pre&s;ent improved &s;tate of medicine, few die of this fever when judiciou&s;ly treated. When this fever proves mortal, and the &s;trength is nearly exhau&s;ted, the patient, as in the la&s;t &s;tage of other fevers, lies altogether upon his back, and frequently &s;lides to the foot of the bed; in this condition, he has always more or le&s;s twitching of the tendons at the wri&s;t, and is affected with low deli|rium, in which he mutters incoherently to him&s;elf.&mdash; His tongue, his teeth, and lips are covered with a dark coloured, &s;ordid cru&s;t: His tongue trembles when thru&s;t forth for in&s;pection; his eyes appear dull and &s;tupid; his &s;en&s;ibility, which in the early &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e was too acute, is now the rever&s;e; his hearing becomes impaired; he do&s;es with his eyes and mouth half open; he &s;ees objects indi&s;tinctly, and clouds ap|pear to hover round him; a &s;tupid in&s;en&s;ibility pervades all his faculties; the &s;phincters lo&s;e their retentive power; the faeces and urine pa&s;s off involuntary; and as if lamenting his hopele&s;s condition, tears &s;teal down his gha&s;tly face; the pul&s;e falters, and only moves in tremors, lo&s;ing, on the &s;lighte&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, all motion; a cold and clammy &s;weat bedews his torpid limbs, his fingers, his nails, his lips grow purple, his re&s;piration becomes interrupted, by a collection of phlegm, occa|&s;ioning a peculiar rattling in the trachia, vulgarly called the death rattle, frequently interrupted by hiccup. The&s;e &s;ymptoms are generally followed &s;oon after by death.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es, this fever is protracted from one to four weeks; in others, it terminates in a perfect inter|mi&s;&s;ion in as many days, e&s;pecially when properly managed. Cold and clammy &s;weats are almo&s;t infalli|ble &s;ignals of approaching death, in every &s;tage and pe|riod of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The whole of the progno&s;is may be thus &s;ummed up. Tone and vigour, or a moderate degree of that &s;tate of body, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of inflammatory diathe|&s;is, without local affection, afford the &s;ure&s;t &s;igns of
<PB N="50" REF="033590_0053_0FF79439D6C4FAC0">
&s;afety: Whereas general failure of the powers of life, or irregular determination to organs of importance, are the mo&s;t certain &s;igns of danger.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on of the year, and &s;tate of the weather, with re&s;pect to dryne&s;s, or moi&s;ture, as well as local &s;ituation, have con&s;iderable effect in varying the &s;ymp|toms, and in determining the mildne&s;s or violence of this fever. In mar&s;hy and wet &s;ituations, and dry &s;ea|&s;ons, the ca&s;es which occur about the latter end of &s;um|mer and beginning of autumn, are generally attended with greater debility, and have much more ob&s;cure and imperfect remi&s;&s;ions; the general diathe&s;is of the &s;y&s;|tem, has al&s;o a greater tendency to putrefaction, mixed with nervous affection, and &s;ometimes with &s;ymptoms of a malignant nature.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach, bowels, and biliary &s;y&s;tem, &s;uffer more under the&s;e circum&s;tances than at other times. When the &s;ummer and autumn have been wetter and cooler than u&s;ual, the fever at its commencement, generally partakes of an inflammatory nature, but the remi&s;&s;ions at fir&s;t are very imperfect, and with difficulty di&s;cerned, yet with proper management they &s;oon become di&s;tinct and complete.</P>

<HEAD>DIAGNOSTICS.</HEAD>
<P>THE remitting fever, is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the typhus, or continued fever, by the remi&s;&s;ions being more di&s;|tinct, and by having only one remi&s;&s;ion in the cour&s;e of every twenty-four hours, whereas the remi&s;&s;ions in the typhus, though perceptible only to tho&s;e who pay particular attention to &s;ymptoms, occur twice in every twenty-four hours. It al&s;o differs from the typhus at Philadelphia, in being more con&s;tantly attended with evacuations of bile, by vomit and &s;tool. It is produced by a very different cau&s;e, and is not like that di&s;ea&s;e, contagious: In the&s;e re&s;pects it al&s;o differs from the yel|low fever of the We&s;t Indies, as well as in the excre|tion
<PB N="51" REF="033590_0054_0FF7943B6F8BBCD8">
of bile, though it often re&s;embles that di&s;ea&s;e, in occa&s;ioning a yellow colour of the &s;kin and eyes of the patient. From the &s;emi-tertian, it differs in no e&s;&s;en|tial re&s;pect, excepting in the violence of its &s;ymptoms; the remi&s;&s;ions in mo&s;t ca&s;es of each, being one day more perfect than another.</P>

<HEAD>CAUSES WHICH PREDISPOSE TO THE REMITTING FEVER</HEAD>
<P>THE per&s;ons mo&s;t &s;ubject to this fever, are the relaxed and debilitated, the delicate and infirm: Per&s;ons thus circum&s;tanced, expo&s;ed to the occa&s;ional or efficient cau&s;es of the intermittent fever, contract a remittent, that is a fever of the &s;ame nature as an inter|mittent, only differing in degree, in con&s;equence of the difference in con&s;titution and predi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es of this fever in order to a&s;certain whe|ther it partakes mo&s;t of the inflammatory, or nervous diathe&s;is, the &s;tate of all the functions of the body &s;hould be carefully examined; for by the prevailing diathe&s;is as indicated by the &s;ymptoms, our treatment of the di&s;ea&s;e ought to be regulated.</P>
<P>If the pul&s;e be either rapid, &s;trong and full, or even low and hard, or ten&s;e, we may be a&s;&s;ured that the di&s;ea&s;e partakes of an inflammatory nature, and more e&s;pecially if accompanied with pain of any particular organ.</P>
<P>But where the pul&s;e is weak and &s;oft, however fre|quent or quick, and there is a corre&s;ponding debi|lity in the animal functions or voluntary mu&s;cles, a contrary diathe&s;is is always prevalent.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e however though generally a good index of the &s;tate of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, is &s;ometimes &s;o much affected by pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, by the &s;tate of re&s;pi|ration and by local affections that we may be mi&s;led, if we tru&s;t to it, without comparing it, with other cir|cum&s;tances in&s;eparable from the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="033590_0056_0FF7944424B53398">By attending to the &s;tate of the &s;tomach, and of the mu&s;cles &s;ub&s;ervient to the will, together with the &s;tate of the brain, and comparing the condition of each with the pul&s;e, we may generally form a proper e&s;timate of the &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In forming a judgment of the &s;tate of the vis vitae from the &s;en&s;ible heat of the body, much caution and di&s;cernment are requi&s;ite; for, although an increa&s;e of &s;en&s;ible heat always follows an increa&s;ed circulation of the blood, it does not always depend upon the force with which it is impelled by the heart, but is often owing to the ob&s;truction of per&s;piration, whereby the heat is prevented from pa&s;&s;ing off.

<P>With re&s;pect to the fluids, danger is denoted by pe|techiae, or the eruption of livid or purple &s;pots; effu|&s;ions of blood under the cuticle; bloody and brown coloured urine; profu&s;e and ob&s;tinate diarrhoea; pro|fu&s;e, weakening, colliquative, or clammy &s;weats, ac|companied with coldne&s;s of the extremities, &amp;c.</P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to the treatment of this fever, it may not be improper to add that ca&s;es of remitting fever frequently occur, e&s;pecially in the early part of &s;ummer and latter part of autumn, in which inflam|matory &s;ymptoms or marks of high arterial action are predominant; this happens e&s;pecially when a con&s;ider|ably long period of very warm weather is &s;ucceeded by heavy rains, and a &s;udden change of temperature in the atmo&s;phere. While the atmo&s;phere continues either uniformly dry and warm, or uniformly wet and cool, fevers are very rare; of this we had &s;triking ex|amples in the hot and dry &s;ummer of 1782, and the wet one of 1788.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e in &s;uch ca&s;es is not only frequent during the paroxi&s;m, but it is likewi&s;e quick, hard, and vibra|ting; the heat is often inten&s;e; the internal functions, and the various &s;ecretions are con&s;iderably di&s;ordered, and the whole &s;urface of the body appears dry and rough.</P>
<P>The remi&s;&s;ion that follows for the mo&s;t part is ob|&s;cure, the pul&s;e frequently retaining, a preternatural quickne&s;s and hardne&s;s, and the &s;kin &s;till retaining a con|&s;iderable degree of febrile heat. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, the excretion of bile is an unu&s;ual &s;ymptom, and the patient is inclined to be co&s;tive, till after the preter|natural and &s;trong action of the arteries, is reduced by depleting remedies. In the&s;e ca&s;es the head and back &s;ufferes more &s;everely, than when it appears in any other form.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="033590_0058_0FF79449E6693C98">In this climate, contrary to what occurs within the Tropics, rainy &s;ummers and autumns, though they do not occa&s;ion the remi&s;&s;ions always to be more perfect and vi&s;ible, they render the type more &s;imple, and the diathe&s;is oftner inflammatory.</P>
<P>In hot and dry &s;ea&s;ons on the contrary, e&s;pecially from the beginning of Augu&s;t, to the middle, and &s;ome|times to the latter end of September, the fever is u&s;ually blended with &s;ymptoms of a nervous kind, and parti|cularly accompanied with bilious evacuations.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ca&s;es the mind is much &s;eldomer affected during the exacerbations, than in the former: Some|times, however the patient is affected with lively and unruly delirium, &s;ometimes the delirium only amounts to a &s;light incoherence in the train of ideas, or a mo|mentary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion in the power of recollection.</P>
<P>The paroxi&s;ms in this variety of the fever &s;eldom ex|ceed eighteen hours, and in &s;ome ca&s;es are fini&s;hed in twelve, and the remi&s;&s;ions are di&s;tingui&s;hed by more or le&s;s per&s;piration, though this &s;eldom extends completely to every part of the body. The remi&s;&s;ions in tho&s;e ca&s;es, which are accompanied with copious evacuations of bile, though more perfect than tho&s;e, in which the phlo|gi&s;tic diathe&s;is is predominant, are by no means com|plete; the head-ach and other di&s;agreeable feelings u&s;ually abate, but &s;igns of languor, and of imperfect &s;olution, are &s;till ob&s;ervable, in the tongue, pul&s;e and &s;kin.</P>
<P>The paroxi&s;ms frequently increa&s;e in violence, in the progre&s;s of the fever, and the remi&s;&s;ions become le&s;s di&s;tinct. In children the fir&s;t paroxi&s;m, is &s;ometimes introduced with an epileptic &s;it, and in many of &s;uch young &s;ubjects, it is common for the febrile action to be determined, particularly to the brain; and to terminate in hydrocephalos internus: This is more particularly the ca&s;e in the early part of &s;ummer, when cold weather is &s;ucceeded by &s;udden and inten&s;e heat.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es, particularly in per&s;ons addicted to free living, in&s;tead of a paroxi&s;m, con&s;i&s;ting of different parts, in a certain order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, there is &s;ometimes an entire &s;tupor and in&s;en&s;ibility, which continues for a
<PB N="56" REF="033590_0059_0FF7944B7B25BD28">
determinate &s;pace of time, accompanied with evident &s;igns of fever, e&s;pecially with flu&s;hing in the face, and full pul&s;e; while in others during the whole period of each paroxi&s;m, and e&s;pecially previous to the exacerba|tion, a tremor and agitation of the limbs are con&s;tant.</P>
<P>In debilitated con&s;titutions, each &s;ucceeding paroxi&s;m generally returns &s;ooner than the regular period, always with &s;ymptoms of great di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ometimes with new and alarming ones; it generally declines at the begin|ning in twelve or fourteen hours, but each &s;ucceeding remi&s;&s;ion becomes le&s;s di&s;tinct, except when obviated by the rules of art.</P>
<P>The fevers which occurred at Philadelphia, in the autumn of 1794, (the &s;pring and fore part of the &s;um|mer of which had been preceded by a great deal of rain,) were generally double tertains, the paroxi&s;m be|ginning one day in the forenoon, the next in the after|noon. In the ca&s;es that became dangerous, or difficult of cure, the paroxi&s;ms were gradually anticipated half an hour, or an hour every day, till the fever became an ob&s;cure remittent, re&s;embling the typhus, or fever of a continued type. In tho&s;e ca&s;es in which the pa|roxi&s;m came on later every day, the di&s;ea&s;e in a few days became a regular intermittent.</P>
<P>In the central parts of the city, this fever was a rare occurrence; but in the &s;uburbs and the &s;outhern and we&s;tern parts of the city it was, to a limitted degree epi|demic. But from the notes which I kept of the &s;tate of the weather and di&s;ea&s;es of that &s;ea&s;on, it appears that on the 1&s;t. of September, there were twenty ca&s;es of &s;imple intermitting fever, to one of remittent.</P>
<P>Several ca&s;es of remittent with bilious puking occur|red on the 16th. Three ca&s;es of double quotidian came under my care, i. e. two paroxi&s;ms came on eve|ry day, one in the forenoon and one the evening, but the &s;ymptoms were always more violent every third day. The water in the ponds which had been con&s;tantly full of water, on each &s;ide of pine and lombard &s;treets began to dimini&s;h rapidly about the middle of the month. On the 19th. a &s;udden change of the wind to N. W. reduced the thermometer 17&deg;. Immediately after
<PB N="57" REF="033590_0060_0FF7944E9E95D580">
this change in the temperature of the air, almo&s;t every family in the vicinity of tho&s;e ponds were attacked with tertian, or quotidian fevers. On the 26th. I vi&s;it|ed &s;ixteen patients, with di&s;tinct intermi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Ten ca&s;es remittent, with inflammatory &s;ymptoms, and three with bilious evacuations. Intermittents and remittents, continued prevalent till after the middle of October; but as the &s;ea&s;on grew colder, they either de|clined or became combined, with topical inflammations.</P>

<P>THE &s;pring and &s;ummer of the year 1795 were agreeable, cool, and frequently refre&s;hed with rain. Torrents of rain fell all the fir&s;t week of Augu&s;t, the wind N. E. and occa&s;ioned remarkable fre&s;hes, which occa&s;ioned great injury to the agricultural intere&s;t. Not a ca&s;e of remittent came to my knowledge before the 16th of this month: From this time till after the middle of October, intermittents and remittents were only &s;poradic.</P>
<P>All the ponds, ditches and hollows about the city, continued full of water, from July till after the 10th. of September, a proof that much rain had fallen within that period: About the middle of the month heavy dews began to fall, and &s;everal ca&s;es of remittents occurred, accompanied with bilious di&s;charges. Seve|ral ca&s;es of cholera al&s;o occurred at the &s;ame time. On the 16th of September, the proportion of intermittents to that of remittents, was ten to four.</P>
<P>By the 17th. the water in the ponds and ditches had dimini&s;hed con&s;iderably, and pre&s;ented a moi&s;t and pu|trid &s;urface to the &s;un.</P>
<P>Fro&s;t was ob&s;erved for the fir&s;t time this &s;ea&s;on, early in the morning of the 23d. The cold weather has begun to give an inflammatory complexion to the intermittents, which have lately occurred in &s;outhwark and the extremities of the city. The weather became
<PB N="58" REF="033590_0061_0FF794521100C0B0">
mild on the 24th. and continued &s;o till the 4th. of Octo|ber, two days excepted, on one of which a con&s;iderable quantity of rain fell.</P>
<P>On the 5th. of October it became &s;o cold, as to ren|der fires nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The proportion of remittents, to that of intermittents, was three to one; but ca&s;es of neither were very nu|merous.</P>
<P>From the 6th. to 12th. the weather was calm and mild; after rain which fell on the 11th. the wind chang|ed to N. W. and became cool and plea&s;ant; on the 13th. it again became calm and &s;ultry, 14th. cloudy; 15th. heavy rain: remittents were now more general than they had been any part of the &s;ea&s;on, and were for the mo&s;t part accompanied with &s;trong and quick action of the arteries. Blood-letting &s;oon after the commence|ment of the fever, to a &s;econd, and &s;ometimes to a third time, from ten to fourteen ounces at a time, was &s;ome|times found requi&s;ite to procure a perfect intermi&s;&s;ion. From the 14th. to the 20th. the weather was exceed|ingly variable.</P>
<P>Ice appeared on the gutters, in the morning of the 18th.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t. I had &s;everal ca&s;es of intermittent, but only one of remittent fever.</P>

<P>The preceding returns demon&s;trate that the bilious remitting fever very &s;eldom becomes epidemic in Phi|ladelphia, though &s;poradic ca&s;es occur annually at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Nor have I ever met with a ca&s;e of bilious, or any other form of fever, occa&s;ioned by the air of the city, or of the mar&s;hes which has communicated a fever to the nur&s;es, attendants, or phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>A regi&s;ter of the weather and di&s;ea&s;es of the pre&s;ent year, I re&s;erve for my intended publication on the Malignant Yellow Fever.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB REF="033590_0064_0FF79459053AAF20">
<HEAD>OF THE TREATMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to the &s;ucce&s;sful treatment of this fever, the fir&s;t thing to be attended to is the re|moval of the remote cau&s;es, or tho&s;e circum&s;tances which gave it birth. Removal therefore to a dryer &s;ituation and purer air, is next to indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep is to attempt by the mo&s;t efficacious means to obtain an intermi&s;&s;ion as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible after the attack of the fever, that the Peruvian bark may be admini&s;tered to the be&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>With this view, we are to con&s;ider how far the vio|lence of the fever on its fir&s;t attack, will admit of blood letting and the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen, always retaining in memory, that &s;o long as the inflammatory &s;ymptoms are evident, which is always the ca&s;e when the pul&s;e is &s;trong and full, or quick and hard, or ten&s;e, however <HI>&s;mall</HI> and <HI>low</HI> it may feel, and the &s;kin continues hot and dry, the tongue white and moi&s;t, the pain in the head, back, or limbs violent, blood letting is not only a &s;afe, but a nece&s;&s;ary remedy, a Sine qua non, which <HI>ought not</HI> to be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s which attended blood-letting in &s;ome ca&s;es of yellow fever, connected with local affection in the autumn of 1793, and an opinion which has &s;ince been conceived or adopted by &s;ome of the phy&s;icians of Philadelphia, that all fevers depend on the &s;ame proxi|mate cau&s;e, differing only in degree, however produced; and that they are all inflammatory at the beginning,
<PB REF="033590_0065_0FF7945BC9C121A0">
has induced &s;everal phy&s;icians to transfer the fame prac|tice to the kind of fever, under con&s;ideration. In ca&s;es al&s;o purely in ammatory, blood has been drawn to an a&s;toni&s;hing quantity, without any apparent injury, but in every ca&s;e as far as I have been able to obtain infor|mation, it has proved injurious and in &s;ome ca&s;es fatal when the di&s;ea&s;e was not attended with inflammatory &s;ymptoms, or when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e were partial and &s;light.</P>
<P>In a great number of patients however with a fever of a remitting form, connected with an in inflammatory diathe&s;is (which frequently occurs in the fore part of &s;ummer, and the latter end of autumn) I have frequently found it requi&s;ite to take away ten or twelve ounces of blood every day to a fifth time, and in a few ca&s;es where the pul&s;e was very quick and hard, I have opened a vein with advantage twice a-day, and I believe it ought to be a rule in all &s;uch ca&s;es, to bleed more or le&s;s accord|ing to the violence of the &s;ymptoms, without regard to the period of the di&s;ea&s;e, or the name which others may think proper to call it. I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time ob&s;erve, that where purging and antimonials are freely employed, they will in many ca&s;es even when inflam|matory &s;ymptoms are predominant, &s;upercede the nece&s;&s;ity of being &s;o very lavi&s;h of human blood.</P>
<P>I have learned by frequent experience the truth of Dr. Balfour's ob&s;ervations, that all laxative and pur|gative medicines as well as injections, are very uncertain in their operation, and frequently di&s;appointment us, &s;o long as any con&s;iderable degree of fever is pre&s;ent. The period therefore at which fevers &s;hew a tendency to remit, &s;hould be carefully watched, and purgatives admini&s;tered on the fir&s;t &s;igns of a remi&s;&s;ion&mdash;And when the&s;e are not evident, &s;till the u&s;ual period of remi&s;&s;ion is to be preferred for that purpo&s;e. At this time they will generally operate and evacuate the bile, &s;ecreted and accumulated during the exacerbation, which is the fir&s;t and indeed, an indi&s;pen&s;ible requi&s;ite in the cure of the&s;e fevers.</P>
<P>Mercury is &s;o effectual for this purpo&s;e and at the &s;ame time attended with &s;o little hazard, that it may be with propriety &s;tiled the key of the hepatic &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="033590_0066_0FF7945D5A32B5F8">Mercury has been for &s;everal years employed as a purge of &s;uperior efficacy in bilious fevers, by &s;everal re&s;pectable phy&s;icians in Europe as well as in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, particularly by Dr. Gilchri&s;t, Pringle, and Hamilton. And it was employed by the late Dr. Huck Saunders in the cure of intermittents, in which the bark failed; but, the di&s;covery of its efficacy in the cure of malignant and contagious fevers when employed &s;o as &s;peedily to affect the &s;alivary glands, was re&s;erved for Dr. C. Chi&s;holm, who fir&s;t employed it for that purpo&s;e in the year 1791.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Duncan's Med. Comment. for 1793.</NOTE> How far it will have the &s;ame effect in ca&s;es of the fever under con&s;ideration, re|mains &s;till to be determined by future ob&s;ervations;&mdash; but from its effects in ca&s;es of ob&s;tinate intermittents, when given in &s;mall and repeated do&s;es internally, or employed by friction externally, till it occa&s;ions &s;aliva|tion, there is every rea&s;on to expect it will have the &s;ame effect in ca&s;es of bilious remitting fever.</P>
<P>Dr. Clark, in his Ob&s;ervations on Di&s;ea&s;es of Long Voyages, gives the following account of the efficacy of mercury in violent ca&s;es of fever. Vol. I. page 182. edit. 2d. "I have had much experience of the &s;upe|rior efficacy of calomel, conjoined with opium, in tak|ing off irritability of &s;tomach, and in opening the bow|els: And therefore in all dangerous remitting fevers, attended with vomiting, burning heat, and pain at &s;tom|ach, I would recommend the pills, No. 4.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Four of the&s;e, contain ten grs. of Calomel, and two of opium.</NOTE> Two to be taken immediately, and one to be repeated every half hour, till the pain abates.

In &s;uch ca&s;es, he al&s;o recom|mends "A hundred drops of laudanum in an emol|lient gli&s;ter; the patient to be put into a warm bath, and when removed to bed, eight or ten grs. of calo|mel to be given in the form of pills, with opium, if the anodine gli&s;ter has not removed the vomiting, the ope|ration of the pills to be promoted by purgative gli&s;ters, and as &s;oon as the bowels are opened, to throw in the bark, in the mo&s;t liberal manner, without lo&s;s of time."</P>
<P>Dr. Balfour, who practi&s;ed medicine twenty years in different parts of the Ea&s;t Indies, gives the follow|ing te&s;timony in favour of the u&s;e of mercury in fe|vers. (Treati&s;e on Putrid Pe&s;tilential Remitting Fevers, publi&s;hed in 1790, page 109.) "Calomel in a decree, &s;uperior to any other medicine, I am acquainted with, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the property of loo&s;ening and detaching the mucus of the inte&s;tines: It requires, in general from &s;ix to ten hours to effect this perfectly, and operates be&s;t when the patient lies quietly in bed. A proper do&s;e to an adult, is from &s;ix to twelve grs. and this do&s;e mu&s;t be repeated from three to &s;ix times, or as often as the &s;tate and contents of the inte&s;tines may require, at the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, and afterwards occa&s;ionally, as it may &s;eem to be required, by the fulne&s;s of the bowels and the &s;tate of the contents." When the mu|cus is loo&s;ened by the calomel, Dr. Balfour, pre&s;cribes a &s;olution of &s;alts, with a very &s;mall portion of emetic tartar, to be given in divided do&s;es, every morning after the calomel, at the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e.

<P>Dr. Blane, in his Ob&s;ervations on the Bilious Remit|tent Fever of Hot Climates, remarks, that "when the fever appears to be kept up by a fre&s;h accumulation of bile, the repetition of evacuants is nece&s;&s;ary, and ca|lomel will be found to an&s;wer remarkably well as a purgative, its &s;timulus being &s;o exten&s;ive as to loo&s;en, and bring away bile, when the &s;aline purgatives had failed of having that effect; and it will be &s;till more effectual for this purpo&s;e, if given alone, in a do&s;e, from five to ten grains, and followed &s;ome hours after|wards by &s;ome other purgative." (Ob&s;ervations on Di&s;ea&s;es of Seamen, page 392, &amp;c.)</P>
<P>In ob&s;tinate and protracted intermittents, that re&s;i&s;ted the power of the bark, it was the practice of the late Dr. Thomas Bond, at the Penn&s;ylvania Ho&s;pital, to put
<PB N="66" REF="033590_0069_0FF794656B11BDD8">
the patient under a &s;light cour&s;e of mercury, after which the bark generally &s;ucceeded. And we are informed by Dr. Blane that Dr. Huck Saunders a&s;&s;ured him, that he had frequently cured agues, in which the bark had failed, by putting the patient on a cour&s;e of mercury, and afterwards returning to the u&s;e of the bark. (Page 428 of Dr. G. Blane's Ob&s;ervations, publi&s;hed in 1785.)</P>
<P>Dr. Chi&s;holm fir&s;t di&s;covered the efficacy of mercury in 1791 in a contagious fever which he at fir&s;t mi&s;took for the hepatitis, in the cure of which its efficacy had been for a con&s;iderable time e&s;tabli&s;hed, not only in the Ea&s;t Indies, but in England, as appears from the 9th. Volume of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries. In the yellow fever at Grenada in 1793, he al&s;o experi|enced its &s;uperior efficacy. Dr. Gilchri&s;t, (as appears from the Edinburgh E&s;&s;ays and Ob&s;ervations, Phy&s;ical and Literary, Vol. III. page 498) more than fifty years ago, entertained the mo&s;t decided opinion of the vir|tues of mercury in the low &s;tate of fever, connected with inflammation. Dr. Gilchri&s;t's di&s;covery has &s;ince been followed and improved upon by &s;everal phy&s;icians of acknowledged merit. But he who&s;e penetration makes the fir&s;t di&s;covery or improvement, and removes inju|rious prejudices, is entitled to the greate&s;t &s;hare of gra|titude and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. Gilchri&s;t's practice was afterwards applied to the liver di&s;ea&s;e in the Ea&s;t Indies, and from an apparent analogy, being applicable to bilious fevers, it has &s;ince been a remedy in the hands of almo&s;t every practitio|ner. Con&s;equently as a medicine in tho&s;e kinds of di&s;ea&s;es, it is not entitled to the di&s;tingui&s;hed name of a <HI>New Remedy.</HI></P>
<P>As the chief objects of attention in the majority of ca&s;es in this fever (when debility and bilious evacua|tions are the mo&s;t prominent &s;ymptoms) are the con|tents of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines; upon the patient's fir&s;t complaint, before the paroxi&s;m of the fever has formed, or while the patient perhaps only complains of alternate heats and chills, the contents of the &s;tomach
<PB N="67" REF="033590_0070_0FF7946ACD6DC268">
&s;hould be immediately evacuated, either by an emetic, cathartic, or by a purging gli&s;ter. But if the pain of his head be violent, blood-letting &s;hould always be premi&s;|ed, unle&s;s great pro&s;tration of &s;trength &s;hould forbid it.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep towards procuring a remi&s;&s;ion, is to open the pores of the &s;kin. This in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, where my ob&s;ervations have principally been made, is be&s;t accompli&s;hed by the following draught, repeated every &s;econd or third hour, with plentiful warm dilution of the antiphlogi&s;tic kind.</P>

<P>Experience teaches us that antimonials are particu|larly u&s;eful in the early period of this fever, e&s;pecially when there is the lea&s;t tendency to an inflammatory dia|the&s;is, which is always the ca&s;e when the pul&s;e at the wri&s;t is ten&s;e, and the throbbing in the temporal and ca|rotid arteries &s;trong.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es however where there are are no evidence of &s;uch diathe&s;is, but where the pro&s;tration of &s;trength is very con&s;iderable, they are not only u&s;ele&s;s, but inju|rious, as they have a tendency to counteract the &s;mall degree of power &s;till remaining, and which can only be augmented by cordial and nutritive remedies.</P>
<P>When the means already pre&s;cribed, fail of in|ducing an evident remi&s;&s;ion, the fever is generally kept up by a fre&s;h accumulation of bile in the gall blad|der or ducts of the liver. When this is the ca&s;e, there is generally a &s;en&s;e of weight or unea&s;ine&s;s about the hypochondria. In the&s;e circum&s;tances a repetition of evacuants is requi&s;ite, and calomel as recommended by the &s;agacious Dr. Blane (a living author in high e&s;ti|mation) is generally &s;ound to an&s;wer remarkably well as a purgative, its &s;timulus being &s;o exten&s;ive, as to loo&s;en and bring away bile as well as hardened faeces, when the &s;aline purgatives have failed of that effect. "The calomel has been found mo&s;t effectual for this purpo&s;e when given during the remi&s;&s;ion, in a do&s;e of
<PB N="68" REF="033590_0071_0FF7946C635B6C10">
from five to ten grains, followed five or &s;ix hours after by a gli&s;ter, or &s;ome mild purgative."</P>
<P>This being effected, antimonial are to be again ad|mini&s;tered in &s;mall do&s;es, and if there be no inflamma|tory &s;ymptoms pre&s;ent, an anodine, combined with an antimonial, and a little of the &s;aline mixture &s;hould be given every night at bed time.</P>

<P>The principal point of management, after an evident remi&s;&s;ion is obtained, is to admini&s;ter the Peruvian bark to the be&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the ca&s;e in tropical climates, more or le&s;s remi&s;&s;ion is always nece&s;&s;ary in this part of the world, e&s;pecially at an early period of the di&s;ea&s;e, be|fore this medicine can be admini&s;tered with &s;ucce&s;s, or even &s;afety.</P>
<P>When the remi&s;&s;ion is prevented by exce&s;s of debi|lity in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, which may generally be di&s;|covered from the weakne&s;s of the pul&s;e, and great pro|pen&s;ity to faint, or become &s;ick at &s;tomach upon being rai&s;ed up; bli&s;ters as well as a more cordial regimen are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and in general produce a favourable effect.</P>
<P>The bark &s;hould be admini&s;tered during every remi&s;|&s;ion, in as large do&s;es as the &s;tomach can retain, without occa&s;ioning much oppre&s;&s;ion or &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is be&s;t in &s;ub&s;tance, but when it cannot be taken in that manner, it may be made into a &s;trong decoction, in conjunction with a little Columbo root and &s;erpenta|ria: Should the &s;tomach reject it in this form, we ought without delay, to have recour&s;e to it in gli&s;ters, with the addition of a little laudanum. In this way, from two to four drachms of bark, with ten or fifteen drops of laudanum &s;hould be admini&s;tered every two hours, mixed with a tea cup full of panada or &s;owl broth, till the return of the fever, during the exacerbation of which an antimonial mixture is again to be made u&s;e of.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="033590_0072_0FF7946E1E6301C8">When con&s;iderably weakened by the paroxi&s;m, a little wine, e&s;pecially old port, on account of its a&s;tringency and tonic effect, &s;hould be occa&s;ionally joined with the bark, or a little of it given after every do&s;e.</P>
<P>Wine however is &s;eldom proper, or even &s;afe in large draughts, in the early &s;tage of this fever, except in tho&s;e ca&s;es when the pro&s;tration of &s;trength is very evident and alarming.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e, where the remi&s;&s;ion is ob&s;cure or im|perfect, and no local affection, or inflammatory &s;ymp|toms are di&s;coverable, the mo&s;t probable means of affording relief, is to excite a univer&s;al &s;weat. This is not only an imitation of nature, but is founded on rea&s;on and experience, for it is by &s;weating, that the &s;it of an intermittent is terminated; this however &s;hould be at|tempted by gentle &s;oothing means, and not by &s;trong &s;timulating, and heating medicines and regimen.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, the following compo&s;ition, given at the height of the paroxi&s;m, is frequently effectual.</P>

<P>To coincide with the &s;ame intention, and to render the effect of the above compo&s;ition more certain, plentiful and warm dilution is nece&s;&s;ary: And I have generally found an infu&s;ion of &s;erpentaria, &s;age, or &s;ome other mild aromatic, preferable to farinacious decoctions, or vinous mixtures. The application of warm moi&s;ture to the &s;urface of the body, renders the effect of the reme|dies already mentioned &s;till more certain. This may be performed by bathing the feet and hands in warm water, or by fomenting the thighs, legs, and arms, with warm &s;tupes; the&s;e operations have the effect of bringing on a general relaxation on the &s;kin, of dimini&s;hing irrita|tion and delirium, and of inducing &s;leep.</P>
<P>But before we make u&s;e of pediluvia and warm fo|mentations in this fever, we &s;hould be well a&s;&s;ured that the &s;trength of the pul&s;e and velocity of the circulation are not already too great, otherwi&s;e in&s;tead of obtain|ing

the end for which we u&s;e them, we &s;hall find if the heat of the water exceeds 98&deg;, they will have a contrary effect, becau&s;e of the &s;tricture induced on the exhalents by the heat, which not only &s;timu|lates the &s;olids, but di&s;tends the fluids. The pul&s;e mu&s;t however be rai&s;ed &s;everal degrees above the healthy &s;tate of action, otherwi&s;e no &s;weat will flow.</P>
<P>Some patients are troubled with ince&s;&s;ant puking previous to the acce&s;&s;ion of every fre&s;h paroxi&s;m, and are &s;ometimes &s;o debilitated and reduced by it, as to threaten immediate danger. In the&s;e ca&s;es after having immer&s;ed the feet and legs in water as warm as can be conveniently borne, from 30 to 40 drops of liquid lau|danum &s;hould be taken in a draught of peppermint julep, or combined with an efferve&s;cent mixture of ve|getable alkali and lime juice, and &s;hould be repeated after every evacuation, till it have the de&s;ired effect. If the &s;tomach reject the laudanum immediately after it has been taken, a double quantity mixed with a little aromatic infu&s;ion or tea, &s;hould be thrown into the bowels frequently. If this &s;hould fail, or &s;hould not be &s;ubmitted to, flannels wrung out of hot &s;pirits of wine or brandy, and covered with powdered &s;pices, &s;uch as cinnamon, al&s;pice, and cloves, or ginger, and black pepper, &s;hould be applied to the &s;tomach, feet, and wri&s;ts; or they may be rubbed with oil of cloves, lau|danum, and &s;weet oil, and covered with heated flannels. When chilly &s;en&s;ations prevail, the&s;e applications are nearly equal to bli&s;ters. Bli&s;ters to the thighs however may be applied at the &s;ame time when the ca&s;e is urgent; and in alarming ca&s;es, a bli&s;tering plai&s;ter &s;hould always be applied to the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>As puking frequently precedes or accompanies every fre&s;h paroxi&s;m, and is attended with a &s;en&s;ible diminu|tion of vigour in the &s;everal functions of the body, and takes place nearly at the &s;ame hour every day, or every &s;econd day; it may generally be prevented by giving the patient from twenty-five to forty drops of Thebaic tincture, in any mild and palatable cordial draught, two hours before the expected paroxi&s;m, and e&s;pecially if bli&s;ters be applied to the wri&s;ts or legs at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="033590_0074_0FF7943463A7BF20">When the ca&s;e is not &s;o urgent as to threaten imme|diate death, the feet and hands may be plunged into cold water to increa&s;e their irritability, before the ap|plication of heat and other &s;timuli.</P>
<P>In many ca&s;es ince&s;&s;ant vomiting cannot be re&s;trained by any means till the circulation is re&s;tored to the &s;ur|face, and per&s;piration takes place. For this rea&s;on we are advi&s;ed by Dr. Jack&s;on to take the patient out of bed, da&s;h cold water over his head and &s;houlders, re|turn him to bed, and to give him a cordial anodine draught, with warm aromatic and palatable drinks. The&s;e means he informs us (and my own experience confirms the truth of his information) generally occa|&s;ion a calm and equable per&s;piration, with great abate|ment of irritability, and frequently a complete inter|mi&s;&s;ion of the fever; and by keeping up a determina|tion afterwards to the &s;urface by means of diaphoretics, diluting drinks, and a bli&s;ter to the liver, bilious eva|cuations &s;eldom become trouble&s;ome during the remain|ing cour&s;e of the fever.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o frequently &s;een the &s;tomach &s;ettled by &s;mall and repeated draughts of hot lime juice punch, while the patient's feet and legs were fomented with flannels wrung out of warm water.</P>

<P>By throwing this powder into a gla&s;s of water, an efferve&s;cent neutral mixture, is in&s;tantly formed.</P>
<P>In the generality of ca&s;es in this fever, it is of much importance to prevent the patient from becoming co&s;|tive, and frequently to carry off the bilious matter which is con&s;tantly &s;ecreted; otherwi&s;e the Peruvian bark, the remedy on which we chiefly depend for the cure, cannot be given to effect. On the contrary, if given when bilious and other acrid and excrementitious matters abound, it generally occa&s;ions &s;pa&s;modic affec|tions, or di&s;tentions of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines; adds
<PB N="72" REF="033590_0075_0FF794744DEDB450">
to the feveri&s;h heat, and often occa&s;ions a foulne&s;s of the tongue and fauces, and &s;ometimes brings on de|lirium.</P>
<P>Moderate and frequent evacuations by &s;tool, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, in&s;tead of weakening the patient, &s;en&s;ibly refre&s;h and &s;trengthen him, in proportion as the aggravating cau&s;e of irritation and di&s;tre&s;s is re|moved from the bowels.</P>
<P>But as bilious, and other excrementitious matters originate and accumulate from debility and relaxation, as &s;oon as they are removed by the recited means, their recurrence &s;hould be as much as po&s;&s;ible prevented by the free u&s;e of the bark, and &s;uch drinks and aliment, as are found upon trial, to agree be&s;t with the patient. The application of a bli&s;ter to the region of the liver, is a mo&s;t invaluable remedy for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Where however, there is great lowne&s;s, and di&s;po&s;i|tion to &s;woon upon ri&s;ing; gli&s;ters &s;hould be employed in&s;tead of purgatives, when occa&s;ion requires. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, copious evacuations are generally in|jurious.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es attended with &s;ymptoms of evident debi|lity, and ineffectual re-action in the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem; bli&s;ters ought always to be employed without delay, the earlier after the attack, the better. The excitement produced in the centre of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, the com|mon &s;in&s;ory, by their &s;timulating power, is conveyed to every part of the &s;y&s;tem, and new vigour is given to every function. That the power and action of the heart, as well as the voluntary mu&s;cles, depend in a great mea&s;ure on the excitement, and power of the &s;en&s;orium, is clearly demon&s;trated, by its ce&s;&s;ation immediately after the cardiac nerves have been divided.</P>
<P>Though the fir&s;t effects of bli&s;tering is to &s;timulate, excite, and invigorate, the di&s;charge which follows, is debilitating in proportion to the quantity di&s;charged, after the inflammation produced by the bli&s;ter has &s;ub|&s;ided. For this rea&s;on, when our view in the employ|ment of bli&s;ters, is to excite and invigorate the circu|lating powers, and not to relax and debilitate, the &s;ur|face excoriated by the bli&s;ter, &s;hould be healed as
<PB N="73" REF="033590_0076_0FF794772FF4C390">
&s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, or fre&s;h inflammation excited by &s;ome irritating ointment.</P>
<P>I believe, from &s;ome trials I have &s;een, that it would be advi&s;able, as one part heals, to apply a bli&s;|ter to another, for the purpo&s;e of keeping up &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive excitement, till an intermi&s;&s;ion takes place.</P>
<P>When from increa&s;ing debility, neglect, mi&s;manage|ment, &amp;c. the di&s;ea&s;e a&s;&s;umes a continued form, (which is very common in low damp &s;ituations, when the weather is very hot, &s;ultry, and calm,) the mo&s;t &s;tre|nuous and per&s;evering efforts &s;hould be made to invi|gorate the whole &s;y&s;tem. For this purpo&s;e, in addition to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive application of bli&s;ters, (one of which in dangerous ca&s;es &s;hould always be applied to the back part of the head and neck, or, if much affected with nervous delirium, over the centre of the head;) the be&s;t of wine &s;hould be given in different forms, in pa|nada, in whey, and by it&s;elf, ob&s;erving always to regu|late the quantity, by the &s;tate of debility pre&s;ent, and its effects upon the pul&s;e, and brain.</P>
<P>Strong decoctions of bark and &s;erpentaria, &s;hould al&s;o accompany the u&s;e of wine, and may be given now without regard to remi&s;&s;ions.

<P><PB N="74" REF="033590_0077_0FF79478C845F738">In ca&s;es accompanied with great debility, tremors of the hands, typhomania and watchfulne&s;s, &s;ymptoms common in the latter &s;tage of this, as well as of the putrid fever, from contagion; opium is at pre&s;ent a favourite pre&s;cription with many phy&s;icians, but they are by no means agreed with re&s;pect to the do&s;es, or periods of repetition.</P>
<P>Doctor Cullen, who paradoxically &s;ays, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es both a &s;timulant and &s;edative power, advi&s;es it in large do&s;es, and to be repeated only once in &s;ix or eight hours, while others, le&s;s influenced by theory, perhaps, direct it in &s;mall and repeated do&s;es, in conjunction with vinous drinks. In this way it is a remedy of &s;u|perior efficacy, in all ca&s;es accompanied with low, weak pul&s;e, and failure of the vital powers; and e&s;pecially in all ca&s;es attended with typhomania and &s;ub&s;ultus ten|dinum.</P>
<P>When any difficulty occurs in di&s;tingui&s;hing the weak pul&s;e from the &s;trong one, we are a&s;&s;ured by Dr. Dar|win (in his Zoonomia, Vol. 2d. page 301,) that "it may generally be a&s;certained by counting its frequency. For when an adult patient lies horizontally in a cool room, and is not hurried or alarmed by any circum&s;tance, nor &s;timulated by wine or opium, the <HI>&s;trong pul&s;e</HI> &s;el|dom exceeds 118 or 120 in a minute; and the <HI>weak pul&s;e</HI> is generally not much le&s;s than 130, and often much above that number. Secondly, in &s;itting up in bed, or changing the horizontal, to an erect po&s;ture, the weak pul&s;e is immediately quickened 10 or 12 pul&s;ations in a minute, which is not the ca&s;e in the &s;trong pul&s;e, when the patient has re&s;ted after the exer|tion of ri&s;ing."</P>
<P>It has long been known to phy&s;iologi&s;ts, that &s;en&s;a|tion and voluntary motion, depend upon a certain power or function of the brain; but it is a di&s;covery of modern date, that, though the mu&s;cular fibres of the heart, are endowed with a certain degree of inherent power, they are &s;till for &s;uch action as is nece&s;&s;ary to the motion of the blood, very con&s;tantly dependent on a nervous pow|er tran&s;mitted into them from the brain, which influ|ences, and modifies the actions of the heart: This is
<PB N="75" REF="033590_0078_0FF7947ACF881300">
evident from the motions of the la&s;t mentioned organ immediately cea&s;ing, upon dividing the cardiac nerves. A force is therefore &s;uppo&s;ed to be con&s;tantly exerted in the brain during life, which is extended to the fibres of the heart, as well as to every other part of the body.</P>
<P>It is evident to the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver, that the &s;en&s;ibility, and irritability of every part of the body, are rendered le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions, by the u&s;e of opium.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es of pain ari&s;ing from any cau&s;e, except that from inflammation, it is a &s;ure and never fail|ing palliative, and generally &s;ucceeds in procuring &s;leep, if given in do&s;es &s;ufficiently large to overcome the irritations pre&s;ent in the &s;y&s;tem, or to allay the ex|qui&s;ite irritability.</P>
<P>The be&s;t method of a&s;certaining the manner in which any medicine operates, is in the fir&s;t place, to ob&s;erve the ultimate effect, and then to go back &s;tep by &s;tep as far as po&s;&s;ible to the primary cau&s;e: The fir&s;t cau&s;e has in no in&s;tance been di&s;covered demon&s;tratively; but in tracing &s;econdary cau&s;es, we may proceed with to|lerable certainty: Agreeably to this plan, I have endea|voured to a&s;certain the effects of opium upon the living body; and have found its fir&s;t effect, is uniformly that of increa&s;ing the temperature of the body. As from the &s;en&s;ible qualities of this &s;ub&s;tance it cannot act like heat, by uniting with, and increa&s;ing the temperature of other bodies, it mu&s;t act by increa&s;ing the cau&s;e of heat, but as the heat of the body is always in propor|tion to the &s;trength, or the rapidity with which the blood circulates through the ve&s;&s;els, nothing can in|crea&s;e the temperature of the body, which does not at the &s;ame time augment the rapidity of the circulating blood. The increa&s;e of heat takes place &s;oon after tak|ing opium, which mu&s;t therefore be owing to the &s;ti|mulus of the opium upon the heart and ve&s;&s;els, by &s;ym|pathy from the nerves of the &s;tomach, or through the intervention of the brain.</P>
<P>When there is great determination to the head, ac|companied with ferocious delirium and great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="76" REF="033590_0079_0FF79480246663D0">
neither wine nor opium &s;hould be employed. The mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences have ari&s;en, from the intem|perate u&s;e of cordials in &s;uch circum&s;tances. Here bleeding, and bli&s;tering the head, and &s;edatives, are indicated; but when the pul&s;e is low and quick, accom|panied with convul&s;ive motions of the mu&s;cles of the limbs, two or three grains of opium, joined with eight or ten of Sal. Am. Vol. made into a bolus, with con|&s;erve of ro&s;es, ought to be given at bed time; and five or &s;ix grains of the volatile &s;alts, with five or &s;ix drops of laudanum every two or three hours in the day time, followed by a large draught of a &s;trong decoction of bark and &s;nake root, &s;angree, or wine whey.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t recited circum&s;tances, genuine Madeira wine is the mo&s;t agreeable, as well as the mo&s;t effectual cordial that can be employed; and may be given with|out re&s;triction day and night, till the &s;ub&s;ultus and tremors give way, and the pul&s;e feels fuller and more vigorous. Some of the ca&s;es which are the mo&s;t un|manageable and fatal, are tho&s;e in which there is a &s;pontaneous diarrhoea.</P>
<P>In every in&s;tance therefore, when the diarrhoea is &s;o profu&s;e as to debilitate, an attempt &s;hould be made to re&s;train it.</P>
<P>This in general is mo&s;t effectually done, by taking a &s;mall do&s;e of tincture of opium, with two or three table &s;poonfuls of the chalk mixture, of the London Di&s;pen|&s;atory, five or &s;ix times a-day, and the confictio opiata, at night.</P>
<P>It often happens, that the patient cannot be prevailed upon to take the above medicines: In &s;uch ca&s;es a few drops of tinct. opii. in a little wine mulled with the yelk of an egg, cinnamon and &s;ugar will have the &s;ame effect, and is much more grateful to the patient.</P>
<P>The hiccup is mo&s;t effectually relieved by opium and aether, and the application of a bli&s;ter to the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;uitable and agreeable aliment is &s;ago, panada, chicken broth, or beef tea; with the addition of more or le&s;s wine, according as the debility is greater or le&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="033590_0080_0FF79481B6252138">When wine rai&s;es the pul&s;e, and invigorates the &s;y&s;|tem, without inducing delirium, it is right to per&s;i&s;t in giving it; but when it occa&s;ions or increa&s;es delirium, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and heat, it ought in&s;tantly to be di&s;con|tinued. The intention of giving wine, is to increa&s;e and &s;upport the powers of the &s;y&s;tem; not to heat, ir|ritate, and prevent &s;leep.</P>
<P>In general, if the bark be given freely in the time of the remi&s;&s;ions, there will &s;eldom be a nece&s;&s;ity to give much wine, during the fir&s;t week of the fever, and &s;eldom afterwards, to exceed one pint of Madeira or port, or a bottle of claret, in twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es, where coma, or lethargic &s;ymptoms come on, be&s;ides the cordials already mentioned, a bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied to the coronal future, and &s;inapi&s;m to the feet.</P>
<P>When the fever is entirely &s;ubdued, and the patient in a &s;tate of convale&s;cency, he &s;hould &s;till continue the u&s;e of wine, or porter, and a nouri&s;hing invigorating diet. He &s;hould al&s;o frequently take moderate exer|ci&s;e in the open air in &s;uitable weather, ob&s;erving to accommodate his dre&s;s, to the changes of the weather, and to his debilitated condition.</P>
<P>To promote a more &s;peedy recovery, it will be pro|per to make u&s;e of an infu&s;ion of cort. Peru. or rad. Columb. in water with the addition of a little of Hux|ham's tinct. cort. or old brandy, with the daily u&s;e of the cold &s;hower, or plunging bath, and a do&s;e or two of &s;ome agreeable compo&s;ition, with &s;al. mart. or flor. martial. If the &s;tomach remains weak and dy&s;peptic, brandy and water, will be a preferable drink, to either wine or porter. Oedematous &s;wellings are apt to fol|low this fever, when it has been long protracted.</P>
<P>The&s;e, where no tumefaction and ob&s;truction of the liver or &s;pleen are di&s;coverable, generally give way to exerci&s;e, and regular, generous, but not intemperate living. When they do not, diuretics ought always to be combined with tonics.</P>
<P>Ten or fifteen grains of pearl a&s;h, taken two or three times a-day, in a draught of the following bitter infu|&s;ion, generally an&s;wers this purpo&s;e equal to any other.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE FEBRILE DISORDERS WHICH PREVAILED IN SHEFFIELD IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, IN THE YEARS 1793, 1794 AND 1795. <HI>EXTRACTED</HI> FROM A LETTER OF WILLIAM BUEL, PHYSICIAN AT SHEFFIELD, TO E. H. SMITH, PHYSICIAN AT NEW YORK.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE entering directly on the &s;ubject of the di&s;orders, which prevailed here in 1793, 1794 and 1795, I &s;hall mention &s;ome circum&s;tances relative to the face of the country in the Town of Sheffield.</P>
<P>The river Hou&s;atonak runs in a &s;erpentine cour&s;e through this town, from North to South. Upon the banks of the river, on each &s;ide, is an extent of intervale, or meadow land, averaging on both &s;ides at about a mile in breadth. The greate&s;t part of this intervale is overflowed at the time of the thawing away of the &s;now, in the &s;pring; and &s;ometimes, by large and &s;udden fre&s;hets, at other &s;ea&s;ons. The nature of the &s;oil, in general, is &s;uch, that, very &s;oon after the water is off, the land is dry and fit for tillage. It is, however, much inter&s;per&s;ed with coves and mar&s;hes; in the former of which the water remains &s;tagnant a con&s;iderable part of the &s;ummer, and in many of them perpetually; of the latter there are not many upon this river, but there are &s;ome which remain &s;uch, through the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the Hou&s;atonak, there are two other con&s;i|derable &s;treams, running through part of this town,
<PB N="80" REF="033590_0083_0FF7948A951041F8">
which unite and empty into that river. Upon each of the&s;e &s;treams are large tracts of low, mar&s;hy lands; great part of which is overflowed by fre&s;hets, and is never perfectly dry.&mdash;There is (which is very mate|rial) a mill-dam, on each of the&s;e &s;treams; and the two dams occa&s;ion the overflowing of &s;everal hundred acres of the low lands. As &s;ummer advances, and the ponds fall, con&s;iderable parts of the&s;e lands are left uncovered by the water; more or le&s;s, according to the drought of the &s;ummer. In both of the&s;e ponds are large quantities of timber and other vegetable matters, which in hot weather, are always in a &s;tate of putrefaction. This &s;tate exi&s;ts in an increa&s;ed degree as the &s;ub&s;tances become more expo&s;ed to the action of the &s;un. The foetor occa&s;ioned by this putrefying ma&s;s is &s;uch, in hot weather and when the water is low, as to be extremely offen&s;ive to the &s;mell, at the di&s;tance of many rods.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this town, who live in the vicinity of the&s;e mar&s;hy and drowned lands, have, as would naturally be expected, been always &s;ubject to remittent and intermittent fevers, from its fir&s;t &s;ettlement. It is, however, generally remarked by the old people, that the&s;e di&s;orders have of late years, until the three la&s;t decrea&s;ed, owing, probably, to the clearing, or par|tial draining, of the lands.</P>
<P>Although, the di&s;orders which have prevailed in this town, for two or three years pa&s;t, are owing un|doubtedly, principally to the&s;e local cau&s;es; yet it is not improbable, that &s;ome predi&s;po&s;ition to them was occa&s;ioned by a general con&s;titution of the air. To a&s;certain this point, with any degree of preci&s;ion, we ought to have before us an accurate hi&s;tory of the wea|ther, for &s;everal years pa&s;t. Even then it would, per|haps, be impo&s;&s;ible; as it ever has been found a diffi|cult matter to trace any connection between the mani|fe&s;t qualities of the air, and the effects of a general con&s;titution of it, favourable to di&s;ea&s;e. As I am un|able, either from minutes, or memory, to give any account of the weather, I &s;hall leave the matter un|attempted.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="033590_0084_0FF7948C294BB760">In the year 1793, during the &s;ea&s;on in which &s;uch complaints u&s;ually appear, intermittents and their con|comitants were more frequent than they had been for many years before. In September and October, there were a few &s;cattering in&s;tances of bilious fevers.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring of 1794, inflammatory com|plains, chiefly of the pneumonic kind, were unu&s;ually prevalent. They were &s;oon &s;ucceeded by intermit|tents; which were more frequent than they had been the year before. Nothing peculiar attended them; and they continued to occur pretty often through the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Towards the la&s;t of July, the bilious, or, as it is called here, the pond-fever, began to make its appear|ance; principally about the South Pond, one of the mill-ponds beforementioned, and near the Canaan line. There were &s;ome &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">attered in&s;tances about the North Pond: and a few, which were at &s;uch a di&s;tance from both, that they were, probably, occa&s;ioned by the &s;tag|nant water about the great river, the Hou&s;aconak. But the di&s;order was chiefly confined to the vicinity of the South Pond. The influence of this pond appeared to extend about one mile and a half from its borders. Within this place there are about 150 inhabitants; and about 80 of this number were affected with the fever: part of them inhabitants of Sheffield, and a part of Canaan. Among tho&s;e who were &s;ick, there were five or &s;ix in&s;tances of mortality. There were not more than ten or twelve per&s;ons who had the di&s;order in other parts of the town. From the&s;e there was but one death; and that in a ca&s;e complicated with pregnancy, and eventually with phthifis pulmonalis. People continued to be attacked with this fever through the months of Augu&s;t, September, and a part of October.</P>
<P>The di&s;order was, probably, in all re&s;pects, what is termed a bilious remitting fever. It began with an ague fit; inten&s;e pains in the back, head, and limbs, &s;oon &s;ucceeded by thir&s;t, dryne&s;s of the &s;kin, &amp;c. con|tinuing without much variation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8 or 20 hours: a &s;light moi&s;ture then broke out upon the &s;kin&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dom
<PB N="82" REF="033590_0085_0FF7948DC5D06358">
a profu&s;e &s;weat; a degree of remi&s;&s;ion of the fever, and abatement of the pains, then en&s;ued, and continu|ed till about the time of day of the fir&s;t attack, when another exacerbation of fever commenced, with &s;ymp|toms &s;imilar to the fir&s;t. If the di&s;ea&s;e was left to it&s;elf, the remi&s;&s;ions would &s;ometimes become &s;horter and more imperfect, as the paroxi&s;ms were repeated, until it grew to be nearly or quite a continued fever. A diarrhoea, and &s;ometimes dy&s;enteric &s;ymptoms were added to the re&s;t. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who died were at|tended with a preternaturally lax &s;tate of the bowels; which in &s;everal in&s;tances, might properly be called dy&s;enteric. The tongue was, from the fir&s;t, covered with a white &s;ur. After three or four days, a black &s;tripe began to appear; extending from the root, towards the extremity; and gradually &s;preading as the the di&s;order advanced, till the whole tongue a&s;&s;umed a black appearance. Even the teeth and gums were &s;ometimes covered with this black fur; and in &s;ome patients who afterwards recovered.</P>
<P>In the treatment of this di&s;order, evacuation of &s;ome kind, is undoubtedly nece&s;&s;ary in the early &s;tage of it. Vene&s;ection generally produced a temporary relief from the violence of the pain, and was, probably, when the con&s;titution was firm and robu&s;t, and the habit ple|thoric, frequently u&s;eful; but it did not appear to me to be important as a curative remedy. Emetics &s;ome|times did well; and where there was a great degree of nau&s;ea, I thought them u&s;eful. But purging, with ca|lomel and jalap, was the mode of evacuation I prefer|red, and generally practi&s;ed; and the remedy which of all others appeared to be mo&s;t advantageous in the early &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay any thing more, in this place, than the a&s;&s;iduous purging, in the beginning, and a plentiful u&s;e of the bark, after the remi&s;&s;ions had become &s;uch as to make it admi&s;&s;ible, were the e&s;&s;en|tial parts of the management of this di&s;order.</P>
<P>So &s;trong was the tendency to di&s;orders of this kind, that people continued in &s;ome in&s;tances to be affected with intermittents, or fever and ague, through the
<PB N="83" REF="033590_0086_0FF7948F95125D08">
winter. The&s;e were frequent in the &s;pring, but with no peculiarities, and yielding to the common remedy with the u&s;ual facility.</P>
<P>During the month of Augu&s;t 1795, I was in the county of Ontario, in the we&s;tern part of the &s;tate of New York. There was, at that time, a di&s;order pre|valent there, of the &s;ame nature with that which I found ri&s;e in Sheffield, on my return, and which I am about to de&s;cribe. It was chiefly exi&s;tent in the neighbour|hood of &s;tagnant waters, and in &s;ituations &s;imilar to tho&s;e places, in this town, to which the di&s;ea&s;e was mo&s;t confined. The treatment required was, of cour&s;e, the &s;ame.</P>
<P>On my return to Sheffield, which was the 5th. of September, I found a number of the inhabitants, about the North Pond, afflicted with a fever, which began to appear about three weeks before. The people fir&s;t at|tacked were tho&s;e who lived neare&s;t to the pond; whole families of whom were down at once. Numbers con|tinued to be taken daily, chiefly within the vicinity of this pond, or within three quarters of a mile of its bor|ders, till about the middle of October; after which time there were few in&s;tances of new attacks. In this time, i. e. from the 10th. of Augu&s;t to the 20th. of October, of about 200 (which is not far from the num|ber of per&s;ons living within three quarters of a mile of &s;ome of the borders of this pond) not le&s;s than 150 were affected with more or le&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e; out of which number, but one per&s;on died, and that an aged man, previou&s;ly debilitated and di&s;ordered.&mdash;The number affected with this fever, in all other parts of this town, did not, I believe, exceed thirty. Of the&s;e, three died: one, an aged woman; the other two, preg|nant women, of whom one died in the fever, the other &s;uffered an abortion, and died &s;ome months after, drop&s;ical.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e, this year, put on a different form to what it did the la&s;t. It might, with more propriety be called an intermittent, than a remittent fever; though it was very different from a common fever and ague.
<PB N="84" REF="033590_0087_0FF7949283957EE8">
It began, like other fevers, with an ague fit, attended with pains in the head, back and limbs. The duration of this part of the paroxi&s;m was uncertain. It was &s;ucceeded by a hot fit, who&s;e duration was, in different per&s;ons, from &s;ix to forty eight hours. A remi&s;&s;ion, and, &s;ometimes, nearly or quite, a perfect intermi&s;&s;ion, then came on; but who&s;e duration was as irregular and uncertain as was that of the paroxi&s;m before. After the fir&s;t, the paroxi&s;ms were not generally u&s;hered in by a regular ague fit; only &s;ome &s;light chills were felt; and the&s;e were irregular, both in degree and continuance. The length of the next &s;ucceeding paroxi&s;ms and intervals could, by no means, be calculated for, from the pre|ceding, &s;o completely irregular was this di&s;order. The fever evidently tended to an intermittent form; but it could neither be called quotidian, tertian, quartan, nor by any other name u&s;ed by authors to di&s;tingui&s;h the different &s;pecies of intermitting fevers. The pains in the head, limbs and back, were very fevere, particu|larly in the latter, which were &s;o univer&s;ally inten&s;e, that the &s;ymptom might almo&s;t be con&s;idered as charac|teri&s;tic of the di&s;order. In the primae viae, flatulency was nearly a con&s;tantly attendant and very trouble&s;ome &s;ymptom. Evidences of an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion and ex|cretion of bile, were generally pre&s;ent through the di&s;ea&s;e, but were particularly ob&s;ervable in the conva|le&s;cence. Some degree of yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, which was almo&s;t univer&s;al, indicated a reab&s;orption of this fluid, and a depo&s;ition of it upon the &s;kin. This yel|lowne&s;s was in two in&s;tances which I &s;aw, very inten&s;e. A &s;light degree of delirium was very common, during the height of the fever. The appearance of the tongue was much the &s;ame that it was la&s;t year.</P>
<P>My method of treating the fever of this year, was &s;imilar to that which I employed the la&s;t year.&mdash;Pur|ging, in the beginning, and afterwards a plentiful u&s;e of the bark, appeared to me to be the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful way of managing it. In extreme ca&s;es, particularly, a free and full exhibition of bark, wine and laudanum, &s;eemed the only means of &s;alvation. It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the patient &s;hould be thoroughly purged,
<PB N="85" REF="033590_0088_0FF7949674B7DD68">
previous to the u&s;e of &s;timulants, otherwi&s;e the bark, wine, or laudanum, would have very pernicious effects. I &s;aw &s;everal in&s;tances, at the we&s;tward, where, by too early a u&s;e of the&s;e medicines, the fever was changed into a continued form, attended with a con&s;tantly dry and yellow &s;kin, comato&s;e &s;ymptoms, &amp;c. One of the in&s;tances of extreme yellowne&s;s, which I have men|tioned, was of this kind, and at the we&s;tward. I re|moved this &s;ymptom, and recovered the patient, by giving repeated do&s;es of calomel and jalap, &s;ome per|&s;pirative medicines, and afterwards the bark, wine, &amp;c. Each purge in this ca&s;e, le&s;&s;ened the degree of yellow|ne&s;s very apparently. The other in&s;tance of inten&s;e yel|lowne&s;s, which I &s;aw, was in this town, in the ca&s;e of the pregnant woman, whom I have mentioned to have died in the fever. This woman's fever never had di&s;tinct intermi&s;&s;ions. Several &s;light attempts were made to admini&s;ter the bark; but it would not do. Perhaps my timidity in the evacuants, on account of her &s;itua|tion, was injurious to her.</P>
<P>The Bark did not &s;u&s;pend the paroxi&s;ms, in this di&s;order, in as &s;hort a time as it does in common inter|mittents; but, if the patient was properly prepared, and the u&s;e of it was per&s;evered in, it never failed to have the effect.</P>
<P>Purging was probably u&s;eful in a twofold way: Fir&s;t by carrying off the &s;uperfluous bile; which was evident|ly &s;ecreted and excreted in a preternatural quantity: Secondly, by reducing the &s;thenic diathe&s;is, which was perhaps always pre&s;ent in the early &s;tage of the di&s;|order.</P>
<P>It is true, that tho&s;e who&s;e fever was &s;u&s;pended by the bark, were &s;ubject to frequent relap&s;es, and to a long and lingering &s;tate of convale&s;cence. This drew an odium upon that medicine; and many were indu|ced to believe that it was owing to the u&s;e of it that people were &s;o long in recovering, and of cour&s;e, that it was improper. I am convinced, however, from very attentive ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e who did not take the bark, but &s;uffered the fever gradually to wear away, as it &s;ometimes would, were equally &s;ubject to tho&s;e
<PB N="86" REF="033590_0089_0FF794982DB6E180">
inconveniences. Indeed this &s;eems to be the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, The old people in this town, who recollect the times when di&s;orders of this kind have prevailed here before, and when the bark was not at all u&s;ed, inform me that tho&s;e who were afflicted with them, were a long time in recovering.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that in all ca&s;es, when patients have got rid of the fever, either by means of the bark, or other|wi&s;e, there remains an increa&s;ed di&s;po&s;ition to the for|mation and excretion of bile, and that this humor ac|cumulates in the primae viae, till it fir&s;t de&s;troys the ap|petite and occa&s;ions nau&s;ea, and then excites a &s;ponta|neous di&s;charge by &s;tool or vomiting, or a relap&s;e of fever, or both. A continuance in the u&s;e of &s;ome lax|ative medicine, after a recovery, has a tendency to prevent the&s;e effects; and, if &s;trictly attended to, would probably prevent them, and perhaps obviate the di&s;po&s;ition to relap&s;e entirely.</P>
<P>In reflecting on phenomena of this kind, the human mind is anxious to fix on &s;omething &s;atisfactory as their cau&s;es. <HI>Specific contagion, I am convinced, was in no in&s;tance which came under my ob&s;ervation, either here or at the we&s;tward, the cau&s;e of the propagation of the di&s;order.</HI> That mar&s;h effluvia, to who&s;e action the in|habitants of &s;ome parts of this town are &s;ubject, is the exciting cau&s;e, and is nece&s;&s;ary to the production of the di&s;orders in que&s;tion, is beyond any manner of doubt. This is evident from their exi&s;ting only where this influence extends. But &s;omething more is want|ing; otherwi&s;e we cannot account for their prevailing in &s;ome years, and not in others. Every circum&s;tance relative to the ponds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have endeavoured to di&s;cover the cau&s;e why the &s;ickne&s;s in 1794, was confined almo&s;t entirely to the South, and in 1795, to the North-Pond; but I can find no local circum&s;tances to have ex|i&s;ted which &s;hould produce &s;ickne&s;s about one, and not about the other, in either of the&s;e years.</P><P>It is probable this was owing to the different direction of the winds, at the different periods when the fever occurred.</P><P>W.

been the &s;ame for many years pa&s;t; and yet very little of this form of di&s;ea&s;e has appeared, for ten or twelve years back, until the two la&s;t. We mu&s;t ei|ther &s;uppo&s;e a peculiar con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere, occa&s;ioning a predi&s;po&s;ition to the&s;e di&s;orders, and co|inciding with the local cau&s;e, or mar&s;h effluvia; or that the mar&s;h effluvia it&s;elf is, by &s;ome peculiarity of the at|mo&s;phere, wrought up to a higher pitch of virulence, and thus produces a higher degree of di&s;ea&s;e. I am in|clined to admit the latter &s;uppo&s;ition, as I am convinced that the fevers which have prevailed here for two or three years pa&s;t, and the common intermittent fever, are the &s;ame, only differing in degree. I have &s;een all degrees, from the milde&s;t form of intermittent, to the mo&s;t extreme of bilious remitting fever. It is impo&s;&s;i|ble to &s;ay where the line of divi&s;ion &s;hall be drawn. The di&s;ea&s;e this year &s;eems to have formed a connecting link between intermittent and bilious fever; and were I to name it, I would call it a bilious intermittent. Should the intermittent fever, in its u&s;ual form, prevail next year, the di&s;order may be &s;aid in the three years, to have been in regular gradations run through.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM <HI>DR. THEODORE JOHNSON</HI> OF EASTON, TALBOT COUNTY, <HI>TO THE AUTHOR,</HI> DATED MAY 16TH. 1794.</HEAD>
<P>"BEFORE I give you a detail of the di&s;ea&s;es which prevailed with us la&s;t &s;ummer and autumn, it may not be improper to give you &s;ome idea of the &s;itu|ation of Talbot, and a de&s;cription of the &s;ea&s;on which preceded the &s;ickly one, as it is a well known fact, that a predi&s;po&s;ition to certain di&s;ea&s;es, are frequently ge|nerated in one &s;ea&s;on, and the di&s;ea&s;es produced in another.</P>
<P>This county is bounded on the we&s;t by the Che&s;a|peak, and is variou&s;ly inter&s;ected by perhaps, as great a number of rivers and large creeks, as any in the Union, &s;ome of which extend for many miles into the country ea&s;tward, and are fre&s;h &s;ome miles from their &s;ource. The country near the bay &s;ide in general is much the mo&s;t healthy, but (as you will readily con|ceive,) is much the mo&s;t affected by winds. The ea&s;terly and north-ea&s;terly winds, pa&s;&s;ing over the un|healthy parts of this penin&s;ula, u&s;ually take up and carry the &s;eeds of fevers with them; in&s;omuch that when the&s;e winds prevail, the bay &s;ide is often as &s;ickly as any other part of the country.</P>
<P>La&s;t &s;pring was very wet, and the months of May and June were marked by the exce&s;s, both in fre|quency and quantity of rain; in con&s;equence of which
<PB N="89" REF="033590_0092_0FF77DF92C6A3188">
the crops of hay, &amp;c. were larger than has been known for many years.</P>
<P>Part of July and Augu&s;t, was uncommonly warm.</P>
<P>We had comparatively few ca&s;es of fever in July, but early in Augu&s;t more people than I ever knew, com|plained of different degrees of indi&s;po&s;ition, from a &s;en&s;e of la&s;&s;itude to an intermittent fever. I really thought the remitting bilious fever (if it may be &s;o called) was al&s;o more frequent, and more malignant, than I had ever &s;een it before. In &s;ome ca&s;es the vomiting was &s;o violent, as to bring away large quantities of blood from the extremely relaxed exhalents of the &s;tomach. I had one remarkable ca&s;e of this kind, which termi|nated favourably: I have no unequivocal proofs that this fever was contagious, but am inclined to think it was, when it run into the typhus type, and exhibited &s;ymptoms of malignancy.</P>
<P>The dy&s;entery mo&s;t generally occurs here in autumn, when fevers of various types abound. It does not always keep pace with the autumnal fevers, yet I am di&s;po&s;ed to think it only a different modification of the &s;ame di&s;|ea&s;e, as they are often very much intermixed, and gene|rally happen at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, and both appear to be derived from mia&s;mata.</P>
<P>La&s;t year there did not appear to be any great uni|formity, in the appearance of the dy&s;entery, with the fevers that prevailed; but I rather conceived it was more influenced by diet, and the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>May not the action of cold, or &s;ome error in diet, co-operating with mia&s;mata and other &s;edative cau&s;es, occa&s;ion the di&s;ea&s;e to fall with more force upon the bowels, than the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem, without the influ|ence of which, it would have a&s;&s;umed the common type of an intermittent? Or would you call this a &s;ym|tomatic affection? I am confident I once took a true idiopahic dy&s;entery, from getting extremely wet and cold, on being previou&s;ly indi&s;po&s;ed, at a time when autumnal fevers were rife, which always impre&s;&s;ed Sydenham's idea very &s;trongly upon my mind."</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM <HI>DRS. TAYLOR AND HANSFORD,</HI> TO THE AUTHOR, RELATIVE TO THE REMITTING FEVER WHICH OCCURS AT NORFOLK, ON THE CHESAPEAK BAY IN VIRGINIA, <HI>AND THE ADJACENT COUNTRY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE country around Norfolk is low land, mo&s;tly within twelve feet of the level of the &s;ea, inter|&s;ected in all directions with &s;alt-creeks and rivers, the heads of which form &s;wamps and mar&s;hes, and fenny grounds covered with water in wet &s;ea&s;ons. Wherever it is not cultivated, the land is covered with large tim|ber and thick underwood. The vicinity of the &s;ea, and the &s;alt-creeks and rivers, occa&s;ion a con&s;tant moi&s;ture and warmth of the atmo&s;phere, in&s;omuch, that although under the &s;ame latitude a hundred miles up the coun|try, deep &s;nows and frozen rivers are very common during the winter, yet here we con&s;ider &s;uch occur|rences as extraordinary; for the&s;e rea&s;ons, the &s;pring is very early u&s;hered in, &s;ometimes &s;o early, that many trees are in bloom about the latter end of February; from this time, however, till the end of April we are &s;ubject to cold rains, piercing winds, and &s;harp fro&s;ts.</P>
<P>About the middle of May, the weather becomes &s;ul|try, with &s;ome cool days, occa&s;ioned by the change of winds to the north and north-ea&s;t: At this period all the di&s;ea&s;es of the winter begin to decline, and the
<PB N="91" REF="033590_0094_0FF794A4B4FCC9F0">
whole country is univer&s;ally healthy (except here and there a trifling vernal intermittent which &s;carce requires the application of medicine) till the middle or latter end of June, when diarrhoeas and dy&s;enteries appear among the children, mo&s;tly with tho&s;e under two years old, though not ab&s;olutely confine I to &s;uch.</P>
<P>In &s;ome years the diarrhoea is almo&s;t univer&s;al, at|tended for the mo&s;t part with an irritation of the &s;tomach, and an irregular fever of the intermittent kind: After the proper evacuations, we apply bark in large quantities, joined to the mo&s;t approved a&s;tringents and anodynes, gum kino, opium, &s;pec. e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;cord. &amp;c. and when the &s;tomach will not bear a &s;ufficient quan|tity of bark, we throw it up in gli&s;ters repeatedly, for many days together, and this we have learnt, by ex|perience, to be the only mode which can be depend|ed on.</P>
<P>In July, the heat of the weather increa&s;es; but dur|ing the whole of this month and the greate&s;t part of Augu&s;t, there are no di&s;ea&s;es at all, at lea&s;t none which can be called epidemic. On the approach of the au|tumnal months, intermittents begin to appear through|out the country.</P>
<P>It is not our province here to recapitulate the &s;eve|ral opinions concerning the cau&s;e and nature of tho&s;e fevers, nor yet to divide them into numberle&s;s &s;pecies and genera. We have never been able to di&s;tingui&s;h any other difference in the nature of intermittents, than that which con&s;titution, climate, and manner of living give ri&s;e to; tho&s;e cau&s;es will divide them into perfect, imperfect, or remittent: The &s;everal termina|tions of them which we frequently ob&s;erve into con|tinued, putrid, or nervous fevers, will be found to ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;es, and under tho&s;e &s;imple terms we &s;hall proceed to treat of intermittents in all their &s;tages.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which occur earlie&s;t in the &s;ea&s;on are uniform|ly of the milde&s;t kind, and yield &s;oone&s;t to the proper medicines. Among the labouring and temperate cla&s;s of our citizens, who&s;e diet is &s;imple, who&s;e hours are regular, and who&s;e u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors is &s;paring,
<PB N="92" REF="033590_0095_0FF794A72BC7BBB0">
tho&s;e fevers are perfect intermittents, generally of the tertian kind, and though not confined particularly to any age or &s;ex, yet are mo&s;t frequent among the younger cla&s;s, the females and the children; they are in wet &s;ea&s;ons almo&s;t general among tho&s;e of the latter de&s;cription in country places, and in low fenny ground. They yield immmediately to proper evacuations, and the u&s;e of the Peruvian bark, and &s;eldom outla&s;t the autumna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> months, even without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any art: Sometimes, however, in relaxed habits, they ter|minate in jaundice, enlarged &s;pleen, ana&s;arca, and death. We &s;hall not be particular upon this &s;ort of in|termittents, becau&s;e they are in nothing different from tho&s;e which prevail in all countries &s;imilarly &s;ituated.</P>
<P>Among that cla&s;s of citizens, who&s;e hours are more irregular, and who&s;e u&s;e of wine and luxurious food is more frequent, tho&s;e fevers, though &s;till retaining the intermittent, quotidian, and tertian form, are neverthe|le&s;s impefectly &s;o; a great degree of heat, quickne&s;s of pul&s;e, and debility remain during the whole time, which may be called intermi&s;&s;ion, with partial or total lo&s;s of appetite. Here intermittents begin to put on an ap|pearance, which we think very different from tho&s;e of any other country; they are preceded by a chilline&s;s, which commonly &s;eizes the patient when he thinks him&s;elf in perfect health. Head-ach, great thir&s;t and heat &s;oon follow, in many in&s;tances delirium, vomit|ing, diarrhoea, and large di&s;charges of bile;&mdash;about the fifth, &s;eventh, or twelfth hour the patient is reliev|ed by profu&s;e &s;weat, which continues with the afore|mentioned heat, quickne&s;s of pul&s;e, and debility, till the next paroxi&s;m. The&s;e are generally of the ter|tian kind, and return regularly if no medicine is u&s;ed, from nine to fourteen days, when they will com|monly terminate altogether, or degenerate into a &s;light quotidian, which allows the patient to walk about, and when the cold weather approaches, for the mo&s;t part, leave him altogether.</P>
<P>People of the latter de&s;cription are more rarely the &s;ubjects of intermittent fevers than tho&s;e who live in a plain manner; and if proper evacuations are made, and
<PB N="93" REF="033590_0096_0FF794A9A6656050">
the bark admini&s;tered with per&s;everance, and attention to the &s;tomach and fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, the di&s;ea&s;e may al|mo&s;t certainly be cured after the third paroxi&s;m, and very often even a &s;econd is prevented.</P>
<P>We have always experienced cathartics to be the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t effectual evacuations in tho&s;e kinds of fevers; and if the patient has an irritated &s;tomach with co&s;tivene&s;s, emetics are not only inadequate and unne|ce&s;&s;ary but dangerous. We frequently find great dif|ficulty in making the &s;tomach bear a &s;ufficient quantity of cathartic medicines to procure the de&s;ired evacua|tions: when this is the ca&s;e, laudanum and aqua men|thae, or extract. thebaic. are admini&s;tered an hour or two before the purge, which generally cau&s;es the latter to remain, and though the opiate retards the operation, it does not ultimately prevent it, or render it le&s;s pow|erful. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fter this we proceed to the u&s;e of the bark during the intermi&s;&s;ions, and without regard to mea|&s;ure, give it as profu&s;ely as the &s;tomach will permit, and in the mo&s;t powerful form, beginning with the powder, and occa&s;ionally u&s;ing the decoction, the ex|tract, and cold infu&s;ion. It too often happens, that the &s;tomach will not bear the medicine at all, in which ca&s;e we give large quantities of the decoction or infu&s;ion by cly&s;ters; and we can venture to a&s;&s;ert, when tho&s;e cly&s;ters are retained in &s;ufficient quantity, the effect is equal to that produced by any other mode of admini&s;|tering it. During the paroxi&s;m, we find great relief procured, by making the patient drink plentifully of a &s;trong infu&s;ion of &s;erpent. virgin. to which, when the &s;ymptoms are very painful, we add laudanum in &s;uffi|cient quantity to procure the patient perfect ea&s;e. The&s;e la&s;t medicines, particularly the &s;erpent. have a vi&s;ible power of &s;hortening the paroxyi&s;m, and will rarely di&s;agree with the &s;tomach. The u&s;e of opium, its &s;afety and advantage in tho&s;e ca&s;es, we pre&s;ume to be well known; therefore we &s;hall decline making any ob&s;ervations upon it, except that we have not found it (as has been a&s;&s;erted) capable <HI>per &s;e,</HI> of curing inter|mittents. It has been advi&s;ed to give it in conjunction with the &s;everal preparations of bark, where the irrita|ble
<PB N="94" REF="033590_0097_0FF794AB51AE13C8">
&s;tate of the &s;tomach will not bear the cort. alone. This expedient will &s;ucceed, if the quantity from time to time be increa&s;ed, and is often u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, though it invariably occa&s;ions great di&s;tre&s;s to the pa|tient when the fever leaves him, by inducing an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;le|rical or hypochondriacal &s;en&s;ation, which if it does not amount to pain, the patient will tell you his feelings are far wor&s;e than if it did.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of this medicine to prevent the pa&s;&s;age of the bark by &s;tool is known to every one; but we think the gum. kino for general u&s;e much better, and more permanent in its effects.</P>
<P>At the acce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e fevers there is frequently a full hard pul&s;e, inflamed eyes, a &s;en&s;e of fullne&s;s in the brea&s;t, and &s;ometimes a &s;harp pain in the &s;ide, re|&s;embling that which attends inflammatory fevers. The&s;e circum&s;tances have often led practitioners, and others who are not acquainted with the climate, to bleed the patient; an expedient, which if it does not produce a tendency to putrefaction, invariably fixes the fever &s;o firmly, that the cure becomes afterwards exceedingly difficult.</P>
<P>When no medicines are given at all, we have ob&s;er|ved before, that the fever for the mo&s;t part will decline of it&s;elf on the ninth or fourteenth day, or degenerate into a &s;light quotidian, and &s;ometimes a quartan; this is, however, not always the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>If no medicine has been given, or if the di&s;ea&s;e has been improperly treated by bleeding, or by too great evacuations, otherwi&s;e by forbidding the u&s;e of wine, &amp;c. the fever &s;ometimes becomes remittent.</P>
<P>In the town we have al&s;o many of the&s;e fevers, which though clearly belonging to the cla&s;s of intermittents, appear in the form of remittents; becau&s;e, there is an evident tendency to decline of the fever at a parti|cular time, once in twenty-four hours, every other day, or every fourth day, and all the diagnog&s;tic &s;ymptoms are preci&s;ely the &s;ame as they are in di&s;tinct intermit|tents, making allowance for age, &s;ex, and con&s;titution; nor do the means of cure differ, though variou&s;ly ap|plied.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="033590_0098_0FF794ACEEF7A6B0">In the town, throughout the months of September and October, many of the inhabitants are &s;eized with fevers, which begin with chilline&s;s, a &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s in the &s;tomach, followed by pains throughout the limbs, neck, back, and hips, great heat and pro&s;tration of &s;trength, which proceed and terminate as before de|&s;cribed, under the term of imperfect intermittents. But others who are attacked in the &s;ame manner, par|ticularly robu&s;t and plethoric habits, or tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to drink a great deal of wine, porter, &amp;c. and take plentifully of luxurious food, have a greater &s;en&s;e of heat, more pain in the limbs, and much more oppre&s;&s;ion and debility&mdash;are extremely re&s;tle&s;s, &s;ome|times with delirium, and great thir&s;t; and when the period of intermi&s;&s;ion of the fever &s;hould arrive, viz. the ninth or twelfth hour, are but partially relieved, that is, the &s;en&s;e of heat is not &s;o great, the delirium and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s are &s;omewhat abated, and there are &s;ome few &s;trokes difference in the pul&s;e; and when there is nau&s;ea and vomiting, tho&s;e likewi&s;e partly cea&s;e to torment the patient, but the pro&s;tration of &s;trength, pain in the limbs, &amp;c. with the dry &s;kin, &s;till remain: Here the evacuation by cathartics &s;hould be attempted without delay, and the period of the remi&s;&s;ion (which though ob&s;cure, la&s;ts &s;everal hours) employed in ad|mini&s;tering bark in every po&s;&s;ible form, without regard to the quickne&s;s of pul&s;e and dry &s;kin; wine &s;hould be given in large quantities, and on the return of the pa|roxi&s;m, the patient &s;hould drink profu&s;ely of an infu&s;ion of &s;erpentar. with wine.</P>
<P>When this plan is followed with per&s;everance, the patient almo&s;t always recovers, though the paroxi&s;m, or properly &s;peaking, the violent hours of the fever, may return once or twice; but if this is neglected, af|ter the &s;econd return, the fever puts on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> malignant and putrid type, and often ends in death.</P>
<P>We have &s;ometimes found it impracticable to make the patient keep the bark in any form, or by any mode of giving it; when this is the ca&s;e, the di&s;ea&s;e is always dangerous, and the only expedient we have left is the u&s;e of wine and &s;erpentar. and we have &s;o many times
<PB N="96" REF="033590_0099_0FF79586D30260F8">

<P>It is a medicine, though of known efficacy, very much neglected, at lea&s;t the proper admini&s;tration of it; like the bark, it cannot be given in too large a quantity, when the &s;tomach will bear it. The fevers of the latter de&s;cription are le&s;s common than the others.</P>
<P>When the di&s;ea&s;e begins to yield to the medicine, a profu&s;e &s;weat comes on; the pul&s;e grows full, &s;low, and &s;oft; the &s;en&s;e of heat and pain in the limbs, back, hips, and neck abate and gradually &s;ub&s;ide; the patient has a de&s;ire to ear, and in a few days he feels nothing but a debility, which is far from being &s;o great as the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e would give cau&s;e to &s;u&s;|pect, and a very little time re&s;tores him to perfect health and vigour.</P>
<P>When it is about to terminate unfavourably, there is an increa&s;ed irritation of the &s;tomach, with vomiting of cy&s;tic bile, mixed with tough mucus, attended in &s;ome ca&s;es with diarrhoea, the pul&s;e grows &s;maller, quicker, and intermits, or rather &s;eems at times to re|treat from the finger while feeling it; the countenance falls, the eyes become glo&s;&s;y, the tongue black and dry, the teeth cemented over with a black mucilaginous &s;ub&s;tance, cold extremities, and death; the pul&s;e, however, is never to be depended upon in the termi|nation of the&s;e fevers; it is &s;ometimes &s;o hard, full, and regular, even at the moment that every other &s;ymptom evinces the approach of death, that inexpe|rienced practitioners would be often induced to bleed or evacuate when the patient is expiring.</P>
<P>When continued fevers from intermittents take place, they are generally confined to relaxed, debilitated, or debauched habits; they are far from being common with us, and as in every other country, they either ter|minate on the twenty-fir&s;t day, or lengthen out into what are called nervous fevers, we &s;hall neither treat of this &s;tage of the di&s;order, or pretend to point out a mode of cure, for whatever may be the predi&s;po&s;ing

cau&s;e, the di&s;ea&s;e is invariably the &s;ame, and requires the &s;ame mode of tretament in every country. We mu&s;t, however, take notice of one effect which &s;ome intermittents produce, viz. a debility or affection of the optic nerve, &s;o as to render the patient perfectly blind, till the bark and other tonics, have removed the fever, when tho&s;e patients recover their &s;ight with health.</P>

<P>HIPPOCRATES, (who practi&s;ed medi|cine in Greece, about four hundred and fifty years before the Chri&s;tian aera, and who was the fir&s;t that we have on record, that reduced the healing art to any kind of &s;y&s;tem) has de&s;cribed a bilious fever, under the title of typhus,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Typhus is employed by the moderns to &s;ignify a malignant or putrid fever.</NOTE> which he &s;ays invades, when the <HI>bile</HI> is moved through the body when the dog &s;tar ari&s;es in the &s;ummer time. In this di&s;ea&s;e immediately an in|ten&s;e burning was felt, together with an acute fever; and immediately the &s;trength was exhau&s;ted, with a weakne&s;s and heavine&s;s of the body, and &s;uch an impo|tency of the legs and arms that they were of no u&s;e to the patient. He al&s;o remarks that the belly was di&s;|turbed with violent gripings, and evacuations of offen|&s;ive excrements. The remedies recommended by this celebrated and venerable phy&s;ician in the cure of this fever, were cold, and thin &s;uppings, black au&s;tere wine, or if that di&s;agreed, white au&s;tere thin wine.

<P>This extraordinary phy&s;ician collected together the &s;igns that occur and appeared to be characteri&s;tic of every di&s;ea&s;e that came under his notice, and by com|paring them with what he ob&s;erved in a natural &s;tate of health, e&s;timated the danger in proportion to the degree that tho&s;e &s;igns of di&s;ea&s;e departed from a &s;tate of health. If the phy&s;icians &s;ince his time had been content to have learned the treatment of di&s;ea&s;es from a faithful ob&s;er|vation of the effects of remedies in&s;tead of puzzling their heads with re&s;earches into their intimate cau&s;es, the healing art would not have been &s;ubjected at this time to the opprobrium of a conjectural art.</P>
<P>Era&s;i&s;tratus, a phy&s;ician di&s;tingui&s;hed for certain in|novations in the treatment of di&s;ea&s;es, two hundred years later than the Coan &s;age, A&s;clepiades and his di&s;|ciple Themi&s;on, who practi&s;ed medicine with reputa|tion at Rome a few years before the introduction of Chri&s;tianity into the world, were all enemies to blood-letting in fevers. Believing the di&s;ea&s;e to depend upon a &s;traitne&s;s of the minute or extreme ve&s;&s;els of the body, and e&s;pecially on the &s;urface, their practice was to prohibit the u&s;e of all kind of aliment for the fir&s;t three days, and to drench the patient with copious draughts of water to relax and render the ve&s;&s;els per|meable.</P>
<P>Hippocrates remarks that one &s;hould open a vein in acute di&s;ea&s;es, if the di&s;order appears violent if the patient is in the vigour of his age, and the &s;trength at that time is al&s;o con&s;iderable<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Van&s;wieten's Comenmt. Vol. 7th. page 196.</NOTE></P>
<P>Serapion who made his appearance about the &s;ame period as Eri&s;i&s;trates, was the founder of the empyric &s;ect, as the latter was of the methodic. His followers were numerous, and many of them re&s;pectable; but we have no account of their practice in the fever under

con&s;ideration. The &s;ummary view of Cel&s;us, or the accidental fragments in the volumnious works of Galen, furni&s;h only imperfect information. Contentions how|ever, ran high between the Dogmati&s;ts and Empirics, the former of whom, were chiefly guided by rea&s;onings; and generally mi&s;led by the erroneous philo&s;ophy of the age in which they lived, while the latter tru&s;ted &s;olely to experience.</P>
<P>Cel&s;us, who lived in the reign of Tiberius, &s;ays, "Blood-letting is required when the fever is violent, and the body looks red, or the veins &s;well, and appear full."&mdash;Cel&s;us however, makes no mention of venae|&s;ection, where he treats of the cure of an ardent fe|ver, by which term the antients under&s;tood a di&s;ea&s;e &s;imilar in almo&s;t, or perhaps in every re&s;pect, to the malignant yellow fever of the We&s;t Indies of pe&s;tilen|tial origin, as appears from the de&s;cription of the &s;ymp|toms, and period of its termination, given in Hippo|crate's Epidemics, the &s;ub&s;tance of which, is delivered in Van&s;wieten's Commentaries, Vol. 7th. p. 96.</P>
<P>In continual fevers, with &s;ymptoms denoting inflam|mation, it was the practice of Galen, who left Perga|mos and &s;ettled in Rome about the year 160, to bleed the patient till he fainted, with the view of extin|gui&s;hing the fever at once. In this kind of fevers, he expre&s;sly advi&s;es blood-letting and the drinking of cold liquors. But he has made no mention of blood-letting, in intermittent or remittent fevers.</P>
<P>Neither Aetius, nor Paulus Aegineta, who lived after Galen: The latter in the 7th. century, and has given an analy&s;is of the opinions and practice of the prolix com|mentator of Hippocrates, make any mention of opening a vein, either in the remitting, or ardent fever, as they term the &s;ynochus.&mdash;But Aroeteus, a cotem|porary of Aetius, treating of the cure of a &s;yncope, the beginning of which he pronounced an ardent fever; recommends venae&s;ection, when the &s;yncope proceeds from too great a quantity of blood, and &s;ome con&s;i|derable inflammation appears about the liver, or pre|cordia. He however &s;ubjoins, that "much le&s;s blood ought to be evacuated, than upon other occa&s;ions,

becau&s;e the lea&s;t error committed in this re&s;pect, may be of fatal con&s;equence."</P>
<P>Avicenna, the Arabian, who practi&s;ed medicine at I&s;pahan, the capital of Per&s;ia; and compiled a Treati&s;e on Di&s;ea&s;es, from the works of Galen, in the 10th. century. His theories are tho&s;e of Galen: In the ge|neral conduct of the cure, he follows him clo&s;ely. He is indeed more re&s;erved with the lancet, while he is not always con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, in the manner of employing it.</P>
<P>The healing art, after the &s;urrender of Alexandria, was little cultivated by the &s;lothful and di&s;pirited Greeks, but it &s;prung up with fre&s;h vigour, in Syria and Arabia, and being extended with the conque&s;ts of the Saracens, it was introduced into the northern coa&s;t of Africa, and from thence was introduced into Spain and Italy.</P>
<P>After the fall of the Roman Empire, the genius of learning made no exertion in Europe, for a very long period of time. The Europeans were content, with the imperfect knowledge they could glean from the writings of Avicenna.&mdash;And part of the 16th. century pa&s;&s;ed over, before any real improvements were made in the treatment of fevers.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t celebrated of the followers of Galen in the 16th. century, were Fernelius, Fore&s;tus, Lom|mius, and Sennertus; men of con&s;iderable talents, but too &s;trongly attached to the opinions of their ma&s;|ter, to exerci&s;e their own judgments to the be&s;t ad|vantage.</P>
<P>Lommius in particular, we are a&s;&s;ured by Dr. Pat|ter&s;on, (in his Remark's on Dr. Ru&s;h's Works,) re|commended the u&s;e of blood-letting in the beginning of fevers in adults, and in whom vigour naturally abounds; but he reckoned it dangerous to repeat it in the exacerbation, or height of the paroxi&s;m.&mdash;When the patients &s;trength is not much exhau&s;ted, but purely a little dimini&s;hed, with lowne&s;s of &s;pirits; venae&s;ec|tion is neither to be entirely omitted, nor the quantity of blood drawn, to be copious. The length of the intervals is to be regulated by the &s;trength of the pa|tient,
<PB N="102" REF="033590_0105_0FF794BADB30FFA0">
and the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e. In great weak|ne&s;s however, the lancet is to be entirely withheld, e&s;timating this condition principally from the &s;ituation of the vital powers; while con&s;iderable caution is to be u&s;ed in judging from the pul&s;e, as it is liable to be affected by a variety of circum&s;tances, which are often totally unconnected with the di&s;ea&s;e. The quan|tity to be drawn, &s;hould depend upon the re&s;ult of a compari&s;on between the di&s;ea&s;e, and the &s;trength of the patient.</P>
<P>In a violent fever, if the patient's &s;trength be not im|paired, Lommius advi&s;es a liberal evacuation of blood, and ju&s;tifies the practice of Galen, of bleeding, in &s;uch ca&s;es till the patient faints, on the principle that the &s;udden depletion brings the patient directly to a &s;tate, different from what he had been in ju&s;t before, whil&s;t he may be revived from the &s;yncope, by refrigerating means.</P>
<P>Botallus, who al&s;o lived in the 16th. century, car|ried blood-letting to &s;till greater lengths, e&s;pecially in pe&s;tilential fevers, in which he a&s;&s;erts, as quoted by Sydenham, that he found no &s;peedier, and &s;afer re|medy in pe&s;tilential di&s;orders, than copious and &s;ea|&s;onable bleedings; in all his patients, which were ex|ceeding numerous, both at the &s;iege of Rochel, at Mons, and at Paris.</P>
<P>Sydenham him&s;elf had a high opinion of copious and repeated blood-letting in the plague, as well as in all inflammatory di&s;orders; but he prohibits it in every form of the autumnal intermitting fever, even when concealed at the beginning, under the ma&s;k of a con|tinued fever.</P>
<P>"Autumual intermittents when the con&s;titution is epidemic u&s;ually appear about June, but otherwi&s;e not till Augu&s;t, or the beginning of September, and very rarely in the following months. It is likewi&s;e to be noted, that it is a difficult matter at the fir&s;t ap|pearance of intermittents, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that are epidemic in autumn, to di&s;tingui&s;h them exactly; be|cau&s;e at this time they are accompanied with a con|tinued fever; and for &s;ome time afterwards, unle&s;s

great attention be given, nothing more than a remi&s;|&s;ion can be di&s;covered; but by degrees they perfectly intermit, and put on a form entirely agreeable to the &s;ea&s;on of the year." (Swan's Sydenham, p. 55.)</P>
<P>"Frequent experience has taught me," adds Dr. Sydenham, "that it is very dangerous to attempt the cure (of autumnal intermittents) by purging; unle&s;s in a way hereafter mentioned, and e&s;pecially by bleeding. For in tertians, particularly in a very epidemic con&s;titu|tion, if bleeding does not prove a pre&s;ent cure, it pro|longs the di&s;ea&s;e even in young, &s;trong, and otherwi&s;e healthy &s;ubjects; but aged per&s;ons, after having long &s;truggled with it, are de&s;troyed thereby. What has been ob&s;erved of bleeding, holds al&s;o of purging, with this difference only, that the latter is le&s;s dan|gerous, unle&s;s it be frequently repeated." (Page 59.) Boerhaave and Van&s;wieten have both adopted the &s;ame opinion. (Com. Vol. 7th.)</P>
<P>In treating of the epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, from the year 1675 to 1680, the &s;ame author ob&s;erves, that "though tertians and quotidians, after a fit or two may &s;eem en|tirely to intermit, yet they frequently afterwards de|generate into a kind of continued fevers, and only come to a remi&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e days that promi&s;ed an inter|mi&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. In this ca&s;e I &s;eize the opportunity of the remi&s;&s;ion, though it be ever &s;o &s;hort, and give the bark more liberally during that interval, than when the in|termi&s;&s;ion is perfect" (Page 310.)</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common termination of fevers, is by &s;weat|ing; this fact was ob&s;erved by Van-Helmont, and fur|ni&s;hed him with the de&s;ign of pro&s;ecuting the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e, entirely on that plan. This practice ap|pears to have been early adopted in many parts of Europe, and was in general reputation in England, at the time Sydenham engaged in practice. Syden|ham having ob&s;erved the bad effects of heating medi|cines, employed indi&s;criminately for this purpo&s;e, was induced to employ antiphlogi&s;tic proce&s;&s;es, and e&s;pe|cially venae&s;ection, which he carried to a con&s;iderable extent, particularly in fevers accompanied with an in|flammatory
<PB N="104" REF="033590_0107_0FF794BE26260590">
diathe&s;is, or connected with local inflam|mation.</P>
<P>But as it is the fate of the healing art, as well as every other, that depends upon opinion, to pa&s;s with large &s;trides from one extreme to its oppo&s;ite. Syden|ham frequently employed his depleting remedies, in ca&s;es which later and more numerous ob&s;ervations, demon&s;trate that they were improper. His practice was always at open war with his principles; for if the fever as he believed, is an effort of nature to exter|minate &s;omething hurtful from the con&s;titution, bleed|ing and tho&s;e evacuations, which dimini&s;h the powers of life, are not the proper means of effecting this pur|po&s;e. In admitting &s;uch e&s;&s;ential differences in the cau&s;e of epidemics, he al&s;o nece&s;&s;arily leads us into embarra&s;&s;ment, and often leaves us in a &s;tate of uncer|tainty; the fevers which he &s;uppo&s;es to be e&s;&s;entially dif|ferent, and occa&s;ioned by different con&s;titutions of the atmo&s;phere, is in fact the common endemic of London, and the adjacent country, diver&s;ified as in other places by the &s;ea&s;on, &s;oil &s;tate of the weather, con&s;titutions of the inhabitants, and idio&s;yncra&s;ies of individuals. Cir|cum&s;tances ari&s;e in all countries, which modify the ge|neral cau&s;e of intermittent fevers, hence the di&s;ea&s;e ap|pears at one time with &s;ymptoms of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ammatory dia|the&s;is, at another with &s;ymptoms of nervous affection, and at another with a general di&s;po&s;ition to affections of particular organs.</P>
<P>Baglivi, who publi&s;hed his Ob&s;ervations on the Di&s;|ea&s;es of Rome, in the year 1696, &s;ays, that "The air at Rome, which is hemmed in by &s;even hills, is na|turally moi&s;t and impure, particularly in autumn, when the days are extremely hot, and the nights cool, and accompanied with heavy dews. At this &s;ea&s;on, the air is al&s;o much impregnated with the exhalations from the low moi&s;t ground, and the waters which wash the &s;oil in its vicinity. That city is al&s;o much infe&s;ted with unwhole&s;ome winds from the &s;outh, &s;outh-we&s;t, and &s;outh-ea&s;t. The air is &s;ometimes &s;o prodigiou&s;ly hot, as to exhau&s;t all the moi&s;ture of the &s;oil, and to occa&s;ion fevers of a very dangerous kind; the Hemi|tritaiae
<PB N="105" REF="033590_0108_0FF794C0A3698D40">
of Galen, in which &s;ymptoms re&s;embling apo|plexy, were common. The air is particularly impure and unwhole&s;ome, near the flat grounds along the Ti|ber. But all the parts of the city, which &s;tand high, and are thick &s;ettled, with a prospect to the north or ea&s;t, and are a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the Tiber, are healthful. In the Campagnia di Roma, which is surrounded by a ridge of mountains in every direction, excepting a tract which extends towards the Mediter|ranean, the air is &s;o impure in autumn, when the &s;outh wind prevails, that if the inhabitants of the city happen to remain there only one night, and then re|turn to the town, they are &s;oon after &s;eized with a fever accompanied with malignant &s;ymptoms, called the <HI>Foul Air Fever.</HI> In this fever, cordial and vinous me|dicines, and bli&s;ters, are very beneficial, but bleeding is extremely pernicious."</P>
<P>About the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, when every department of &s;cience, had arrived at a con&s;ider|able degree of improvement, there appeared in the writings of Stahl, of Hoffman, and of Boerhaave, three new and con&s;iderably different &s;y&s;tems of phy&s;ic, which for a con&s;iderable time had, and &s;till in many parts of Europe, have a con&s;iderable &s;hare in directing the treat|ment of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Tru&s;ting much to the efforts of the animal &s;y&s;tem, which they &s;uppo&s;ed were conducted with con&s;tant at|tention and wi&s;dom: Stahl and his di&s;ciples have in ge|neral, propo&s;ed only very inert and frivolous remedies, and are extremely re&s;erved in the u&s;e of blood-letting, vomits, &amp;c. in fevers.</P>
<P>The celebrated Boerhaave, who was profe&s;&s;or of the theory and practice of phy&s;ic, in the Univer&s;ity of Ley|den; in his Aphori&s;ms concerning the knowledge, and cure of intermittents, particularly at Section 762, ex|pre&s;sly &s;ays, "Hence blood-letting in the&s;e fevers, is in it&s;elf generally prejudicial, otherwi&s;e it may be of &s;ervice by accident, or in some ca&s;es, as may be, like|wi&s;e a thin and &s;trict diet."</P>
<P>On this Aphori&s;m, his learned and experienced commentator, the Baron Van&s;wieten makes the follow|ing,
<PB N="106" REF="033590_0109_0FF794C234953650">
among other remarks; "Since blood-letting is &s;o efficacious a remedy in quieting the too great violence of a fever, as we &s;aid before, many phy&s;icians have been likewi&s;e of opinion, that it may be of great u&s;e in the cure of intermitting fevers; and &s;ome have even believed, that the&s;e fevers might be removed only by repeated blood-letting. But &s;ince it was demon&s;trated under the preceding Aphori&s;m, that all evacuations if violent and repeated, are prejudicial becau&s;e they weaken, &s;o the &s;ame is true likewi&s;e of blood-letting."</P>
<P>IN the Sy&s;tem of Medicine of Dr. Hoffman, late pro|fe&s;&s;or at Hall in Saxony, publi&s;hed at Geneva in the year 1761, &s;ince tran&s;lated by the late Dr. Lewis, and publi&s;hed by Dr. Duncan; we have the following ob|&s;ervations on intermittents and remittents, &amp;c. Vol. 1&s;t. p. 55, 56, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"In the uncommonly hot and dry &s;ummers and autumns of 1726, 1727 and 1728, a variety of ano|malous, malignant intermittents were epidemic almo&s;t throughout Germany. Some &s;uffered one, &s;ome two &s;its a day. In &s;ome they were at fir&s;t continual, and changed on the 3rd. or 4th. day into intermittents; in others they intermitted at fir&s;t, and changed afterwards into dangerous continuals. In &s;ome there were exce&s;|&s;ive evacuations of bilious and pituitous matter, both upwards and downwards, in others con&s;tant &s;weats, and faintne&s;s, during the remi&s;&s;ions or intermi&s;&s;ions. Some complained, during the fever, of heat and cold at the &s;ame time. Young per&s;ons were &s;ometimes highly delirious in the paroxi&s;m; the aged sleepy: All com|plained of an anxiety and painful pre&s;&s;ure about the region of the &s;tomach; a dull pain of the loins, feet and head, and in the time of intermi&s;&s;ion, a pain in the nape of the neck, &s;capulae, and along the &s;pine. At length pu&s;tles breaking out on the face, or purple mi|liary eruptions on the body, all the &s;ymptoms abated. if a &s;orbutic miliary fever was joined, the di&s;ea&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="033590_0110_0FF794C4B3CB9520">
proved of longer continuance; if the eruptions were white, it was generally fatal.</P>
<P>"The&s;e fevers were mo&s;t frequent in mar&s;hy places; to per&s;ons of an irregular life, or weak con&s;titution; after bleeding, &s;trong purgatives, immoderate pa&s;&s;ions; and to women on the approach of the monthly period. Freedom of per&s;piration, openne&s;s of the bowels, avoiding cold moi&s;t air and unwhole&s;ome foods, were the &s;ure&s;t pre&s;ervatives. Some recovered in a fort|night; with others the di&s;ea&s;e la&s;ted a month. Very few died, unle&s;s from &s;ome great mi&s;management.</P>

<HEAD>GENERAL METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. "In the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;mall do&s;es of nitre were given, both in the paroxi&s;ms, and in the intermi&s;&s;ions, along with &s;ome agreeable &s;imple wa|ters, to which were added a few drops of &s;pir. nit. dulc. or the mineral anodyne liquor. The common drink was water gruel, with lemon juice and lemon peel, or reduced with almonds, into the form of an emul&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. "The belly, where co&s;tive, was loo&s;ened by gli&s;ters of water-gruel, with cammomile flowers, oil of almonds, and common &s;alt, and potions of mana and cream of Tartar. In &s;ome per&s;ons, rhubarb an&s;wered better.</P>
<P N="3">3&punc; "A &s;weat was promoted at the end of the pa|roxi&s;ms, where nature was too weak to effect it with|out a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by &s;aturated diaphoretic mixtures, mix|ed with equal quantity of the anodyne liquor, and a few drops of volatile aromatic &s;pirits.</P>
<P N="4">4. "When, by the&s;e means, the fever had abated, and changed into a true intermittent, it was &s;ucce&s;sfully treated as &s;uch. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the bark was given at the beginning, after a gentle emetic, along with ca&s;ca|rilla, nitre and calx of antimony.</P>

<P>"When vomiting, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and coolne&s;s of the ex|tremities were urgent, a gentle diaphore&s;is was pro|moted by the mineral anoydine liquor, mixed with a few drops of volatile &s;pirits, di&s;tilled oil of mace, or a &s;mall quantity of the extract of &s;affron, and warm di|luting drinks."</P>
<P>SIR JOHN PRINGLE ob&s;erves, that, "Though all moi&s;t countries are &s;ubject to intermittents, yet if the moi&s;|ture be pure, and the &s;ummers are not clo&s;e and hot, the fevers will mo&s;tly appear in a regular tertian form, and be ea&s;ily cured. But if the moi&s;ture ari&s;es from &s;tagnating water, in which plants, fi&s;h, and in&s;ects die and rot, then the damps being of a putrid nature, not only occa&s;ion more frequent, but more dangerous fe|vers, which oftener appear in the form of quotidians, or double tertians, than, in that of &s;ingle ones.</P>
<P>The&s;e mar&s;h fevers are not only apt to begin with little remi&s;&s;ion, but after intermitting for &s;ome days, to change again into continual fevers, with putrid and malignant &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o remarkable how they vary with the &s;ea&s;on; for however frequent, violent, or dangerous they have been in the decline of &s;ummer, or beginning of autumn, when putrid exhalations are mo&s;t abundant, yet before winter, they are reduced to a &s;mall number, become mild, and generally a&s;&s;ume a regular tertian form.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t kind were ob&s;erved in the campaign of the year 1747, to prevail near the inundations in Dutch Brabant; the next were tho&s;e of Zealand; of the 3d. degree, were tho&s;e in the lines of Bergan-op-Zoom; and the milde&s;t &s;ort, were &s;uch as were mo&s;t frequent in the cantonments around Eyndhoven, in villages ren|dered moi&s;t by plantations, and &s;ubterraneous water.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="033590_0112_0FF794C8F80E6338">At the height of the epidemic it appeared, that both intermittents and remittents, by extending or doubling their paroxi&s;ms, frequently changed into a continued, putrid and dangerous form, and that mo&s;t of tho&s;e that were lo&s;t, died in this way. But in general the mor|tality was not in proportion to the number of the &s;ick, nor to the alarming nature of the &s;ymptoms. Although the di&s;temper was violent, yet it yielded to medicine; and no kind of acute di&s;order &s;eemed to require it more. One of the mo&s;t unfavourable circum&s;tances, was the pronene&s;s to a relap&s;e, the danger of which was great|e&s;t during the hot weather, le&s;s in the decline of autumn, and lea&s;t of all after the fro&s;ts began.</P>
<P>Frequent relap&s;es brought on vi&s;ceral ob&s;tructions, which made the intermittents more ob&s;tinate and ir|regular, and terminate in a drop&s;y, or jaundice. (p. 182,) &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fifteen hundred patients, the greate&s;t part with the dy&s;entery, and a number of wounded men, being crowded together in a ho&s;pital, 3 leagues from Ha|nau, vitiated the air, and gave ri&s;e to a &s;till more alarming di&s;temper, viz. the jail or ho&s;pital fever; the common effects of foul air from crowds and animal corruption. (p. 22). This fever, and the dy&s;entery grew daily wor&s;e. Few e&s;caped, for however mild or bad the flux was, for which the per&s;on was &s;ent to the ho&s;pital, this fever almo&s;t &s;urely &s;upervened.</P>
<P>The petaechial &s;pots, blotches, tumifaction of the pa|rotids, frequent mortifications, contagion, and the great mortality, &s;ufficiently &s;hewed its pe&s;tilential nature.</P>
<P>Of fourteen mates employed about the &s;ick, five died; and excepting one or two, all the re&s;t had been ill and in danger. The ho&s;pital lo&s;t near half of the patients; but the inhabitants of the village having fir&s;t received the flux, and afterwards this fever by contagion, were almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>One general ho&s;pital being e&s;tabli&s;hed at Newied, the &s;ick were removed from their &s;everal quarters, and carried down the Rhine to that place; where by the change of the air, tho&s;e from Feckenheim were at fir&s;t relieved, but the re&s;t who were mixed with them caught
<PB N="110" REF="033590_0113_0FF794CB77296238">
the infection, which the following circum&s;tance ren|dered &s;till more general and fatal. For orders coming &s;oon after to remove all the &s;ick from Germany to Flanders, they were embarked in Bilanders, and con|veyed by water to Ghent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Capital of Flanders.</NOTE> During this voyage, the fever having acquired new force by the confinement of the air, by the mortification and other putrid effluvia, it became &s;o virulent, that above half the number died in the boats, and &s;everal of the remainder &s;oon after their arrival.</P>
<P>The re&s;emblance of this ho&s;pital fever, to the true plague was further evinced, by the following memora|ble incident.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The late malignant fever in Philadelphia, was occa&s;ioned by a circum&s;tance very &s;imilar to this recorded by Sir John Pringle, viz. by the light &s;ails made u&s;e of for bedding, by the crew of the &s;hip Arethu&s;a from the Havanna; and also by tho&s;e of the armed &s;hip Hind, from St. Domingo, which were put into &s;hores and &s;ail lofts near the places where those ve&s;&s;els anchored. W. C.</NOTE> A parcel of old tents being &s;ent on board the &s;ame Bilanders with the men, were u&s;ed by them for bedding: The&s;e tents, in order to be re|fitted were put into the hands of a trade&s;man at Ghent, who having employed 23 Flemmi&s;h journeymen about the work, lo&s;t 17 of them by the di&s;temper, though they had no other communication with the infected."</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and from the frequent no|tice taken of the &s;uppo&s;ed contagious effects of the dy|&s;entery, it is manife&s;t that Sir John Pringle never ob|&s;erved the remitting or intermitting fever to be propa|gated by contagion; on the contrary, he expre&s;sly &s;ays, the circum&s;tance of the dy&s;entery being contagi|ous, &s;hews that it is e&s;&s;entially different from the&s;e fevers.</P>
<P>Sir John Pringle is of opinion from the &s;ymptoms and contagious nature of the pe&s;tilential fever, which occur|ed in the Imperial army in Hungary, A. D. 1566, de|&s;cribed by Sennertus, (p. 254 Edit. 6th.) that it was a compound of the bilious and ho&s;pital fever, taking its ri&s;e in the camp, but acquiring its high degree of ma|lignity
<PB N="111" REF="033590_0114_0FF794CF41C16AC8">
and contagious quality, from the foul air of the places in which the &s;ick were crowded.</P>
<P>In his Ob&s;ervations on the treatment of the bilious remitting, and intermitting fevers of mar&s;hy countries, Sir John Pringle remarks, that "In mo&s;t ca&s;es, it was nece&s;&s;ary to open a vein, either upon the fir&s;t attack, or the next day, if there was no intermi&s;&s;ion. But re|peated bleedings, unle&s;s upon evident marks of a fixed inflammation were &s;o far from producing the de&s;ired effect, that they &s;eemed to render the fever more ob|&s;tinate. It ought al&s;o to be remarked, that the rule about bleeding regards the &s;oldiers only, and not the natives, who&s;e con&s;titutions were different from the &s;ol|diers, who were not only young, but robu&s;t and &s;an|guine. And even among the &s;oldiers, bleeding was &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary upon a relap&s;e, as the fever then ap|peared without inflammation, and as a regular inter|mittent.</P>
<P>An antimonial emetic generally rendered the inter|mi&s;&s;ion more di&s;tinct. The mar&s;h fever, during the hot &s;ea&s;on, being more apt to run into double parox|i&s;ms or to change into a continued form, than to re|main regularly intermittent, it was nece&s;&s;ary after due preparation to &s;top it in the fir&s;t fair intermi&s;&s;ion. And for this purpo&s;e, the bark was found to be no le&s;s &s;pecific in tho&s;e parts than at home&mdash;and there was no &s;ecurity again&s;t relap&s;es, unle&s;s the patient took an ounce of the bark in powder, once every ten or twelve days throughout the autumn. The mo&s;t effectual way to make a &s;oldier continue the u&s;e of the bark, is to mix it with equal parts of brandy and water." Page 109, &amp; &s;equent.</P>

intermittent tertian. The cold &s;it &s;eldom la&s;ts above an hour or two; and as it goes off, &s;ome bilious matter is commonly di&s;charged by vomit or &s;tool. Then fol|lows an inten&s;e heat over the whole body, which rai&s;es the mercury in the thermometer to the 103d or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">04th degree: And la&s;tly, a profu&s;e &s;weat puts an end to the paroxi&s;m. The apyrexy is tolerably complete, though for the mo&s;t part the patient complains of a di&s;agree|able taste, lo&s;s of appetite, head-ach, and pain in the &s;mall of his back, and pit of his &s;tomach upon a full in&s;piration. The pul&s;e during the intermi&s;&s;ion is almo&s;t natural: in the fits it varies according to their predo|minant &s;ymptoms: When they are attended by acute pains in the <HI>praecordia,</HI> it becomes &s;mall and ob&s;cure, &s;o as to indicate greater weakne&s;s than there really is: on the other hand, when drow&s;y lethargic &s;ymptoms come on, it often re&s;embles that of a per&s;on in full health, though the &s;ick is in the utmo&s;t danger. The urine, whether made in the time of the paroxi&s;m or interval, is always clear, frothy, and of a deep red co|lour, without any &s;eparation. Blood drawn from a vein is mo&s;t commonly florid like &s;carlet, without any &s;izey cru&s;t: the <HI>&s;erum</HI> is &s;ometimes tinged with yellow, but oftner red like the <HI>lotura carnium,</HI> and in great quantity. Sometimes the <HI>&s;erum</HI> and <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum</HI> re|main united in a lax gelatinous ma&s;s.</P>
<P>As the fever advances to its height, the coldne&s;s and &s;hivering which u&s;her in the paroxi&s;ms become le&s;s, or intirely imperceptible: in which ca&s;e a <HI>cholera mor|bus,</HI> or acute pains in the back or limbs, often &s;upply their place: frequently the &s;hiverings are intermixed with flu&s;hings of heat. In the mean time, the parox|i&s;ms them&s;elves become longer, and bring on more formidable &s;ymptoms; &s;uch as head-achs, raving, <HI>&s;opors,</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="033590_0116_0FF794D29D3DE6A0">
apoplectic fits, bleeding at the no&s;e, cough, difficulty of breathing, palpitation of the heart, irregularity of the pul&s;e, &s;ickne&s;s and anxiety, pain about the upper orifice of the &s;tomach, vomiting and purging; heat, ten&s;ion, pain and pul&s;ation in the abdominal <HI>vi&s;cera; &s;ub&s;ultus tendinum,</HI> and an infinite variety of other com|plaints, which do not entirely cea&s;e with the &s;weat, that carries off the paroxi&s;m; &s;o that the apyrexy is not only &s;hortened, but rendered more ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it often happens, during the &s;econd, third, fourth, or fifth period, that the tertian becomes double, though at fir&s;t it was &s;imple: Or if it was double from the beginning, the weaker fit continues, without any intermi&s;&s;ion, till the &s;tronger comes on, and both being blended together, the di&s;ea&s;e puts on the appearance of a &s;emitertian, having one very long fit, with a &s;hort interval every forty-eight hours. Sometimes a double tertian degenerates into a triple tertian, two fits in&s;tead of one happening on the odd days.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t likewi&s;e be ob&s;erved, that, in the progre&s;s of the fever, the regular order of the periods is frequently di&s;turbed, by the paroxi&s;ms changing their hour of inva&s;ion, and attacking, unawares without any previous cold. Nor are anticipating fits always a bad &s;ign, or tho&s;e which po&s;tpone a good one, as &s;ome authors in|&s;inuate; on the contrary, the fir&s;t frequently &s;hew the &s;trength of nature, as the others do her weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>After this manner the&s;e proteform di&s;tempers con|tinue to vary their &s;hape in every period, and to pro|duce longer, more fevere, or more frequent paroxi&s;ms, till they arrive at their height; about which time the fits and intervals are often &s;o confu&s;ed, that they are &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed: neverthele&s;s, if death be not &s;peedily the con&s;equence of this confu&s;ion, they commonly again put on a more &s;imple or regular form, and, after one or more &s;light paroxi&s;ms, go away of their own accord.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e fevers which come to their height in the third period, terminate in the fourth or fifth period. Tho&s;e which come to their height in the fourth period, terminate in the fifth or &s;ixth. And tho&s;e which come
<PB N="114" REF="033590_0117_0FF794D51E3BD670">
to their height in the fifth, terminate in the &s;ixth or &s;eventh. When the mo&s;t vehement paroxi&s;ms happen on the odd days, the <HI>cri&s;es</HI> will be on the odd days: When they happen on the even days, the great changes of the di&s;temper will likewi&s;e be on the even days.</P>
<P>If the fever increa&s;es to the &s;eventh period, it proba|bly will not cea&s;e before the ninth: But it rarely hap|pens that intermitting or remitting tertians run out to &s;o great a length. Yet I have &s;een every year a few of the continual kind, which began with great mild|ne&s;s, and increa&s;ing by &s;low degrees, broke out vio|lently in the third or fourth week; and &s;oon after ended in intermittents; though &s;ome of them have conti|nued without any con&s;iderable interval, for &s;ix or &s;even weeks.</P>
<P>In the cure of tertians, the &s;ymptoms of the parox|i&s;ms are more to be regarded than the types of the periods; for <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> &s;imple, double, triple, in|termittent, and remittent tertians, together with the &s;emitertians, all require the &s;ame &s;ort of treatment.</P>
<P><HI>With regard to bleeding</HI> it has been warmly debated among both antient and modern authors where it ought or ought not to be u&s;ed in tertian fevers. Much has been wrote on both &s;ides; but the que&s;tion appears to me too general to admit of a po&s;itive an&s;wer. CELSUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Med. Praefat.</NOTE> has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved that <Q>medicines differ, according to the nature of the climate; one kind being nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>Rome,</HI> another in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and a third in <HI>France.</HI></Q> And &s;ince we daily meet with a remarkable diver&s;ity of &s;ymptoms among fevers of the tertian tribe even in the &s;ame climate at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of the year, it cannot &s;urely be &s;urprizing that any one remedy is not equally beneficial in all ca&s;es, and at all times.</P>
<P>For my own part, when I was called early enough, in the beginning of the&s;e fevers I u&s;ed to take away &s;ome blood (unle&s;s there was a &s;trong contraindica|tion) from people of all ages; namely, from robu&s;t
<PB N="115" REF="033590_0118_0FF794D88A6ABB98">
adults ten or twelve ounces; from others a &s;maller quantity in proportion to their &s;trength and years. And farther, if a violent head-ach, and ob&s;tinate <HI>deli|rium,</HI> and great heat or pains of the bowels were urgent, within a day or two, I repeated the bleeding. By which &s;ea&s;onable evacuation the vehemency of the paroxi&s;ms is &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed; the apyrexies be|come more compleat; the operation of emetics and cathartics is rendered &s;afer and more &s;ucce&s;sful; and the terrible &s;ymptoms, which often make their appear|ance about the height of the di&s;temper, &s;uch as raving <HI>&s;opor,</HI> difficulty of breathing, inflammations of the <HI>abdo|minal, vi&s;cera, &amp;c.</HI> are either prevented or mitigated.</P>
<P>But if before I was called, the fever had already con|tinued &s;ome time, and the ma&s;s of blood appeared to be too much melted down, or inclinable to a putrid di&s;&s;olution, which is often the ca&s;e, during the extreme hot weather, about the fourth period of the di&s;temper, and is readily known by the great alteration of the patient's looks and his &s;udden lo&s;s of &s;trength; or if the fir&s;t paroxi&s;ms of the di&s;ea&s;e were attended with profu&s;e evacuations, whether by vomiting, purging, &s;weating, or a haemorrhage from the no&s;e: In all the&s;e circum&s;tances, I either omitted the bleeding entirely, or took away a very &s;mall quantity, though &s;ome im|portunate &s;ymptoms might &s;eem to require a much larger evacuation.</P>
<P>But when bleeding is allowed to be nece&s;&s;ary, it is a&s;ked at what particular time of the periodical revolu|tion it ought to be performed? The ancients<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si vehemens febris urget, in ip&s;o impetu ejus, &s;anguinem mittere hominem jugulare e&s;t, expectanda ergo intermi&s;&s;io, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> CEL. l. ii. c. x.</NOTE> be|lieved that <Q>to open a vein in the height of the fever, was to de&s;troy the patient;</Q> and therefore they order you to wait for the intermi&s;&s;ion, or the hour on which the &s;ymptoms are generally mo&s;t moderate. But the experience of the pre&s;ent age has taught us that this operation is &s;afe enough, at any time of the
<PB N="116" REF="033590_0119_0FF794DA1AE34148">
period, unle&s;s while the cold fit la&s;ts, or is &s;oon ex|pected; or while the &s;kin is covered with critical &s;weats. Of late years, encouraged by the example of &s;ome practitioners of reputation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A&s;truc on Fevers, p. 71. Gourraigne de Febribus.</NOTE>, I commonly opened a vein in the beginning of the hot fit; by which means the &s;ick were immediately relieved; the immo|derate heat of the body (which is often productive of fatal effects) was dimini&s;hed; and the critical &s;weats were brought on &s;ooner, and in greater abundance. But when that time of the paroxi&s;m was pa&s;&s;ed before my being called, I bled in the evening, when it abated or went off, that I might be at liberty next day to make u&s;e of the remi&s;&s;ion or intermi&s;&s;ion, which com|monly happens in the morning, to evacuate the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t became acquainted with the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, the uncommon violence of their &s;ymptoms induced me to lay the principal &s;tre&s;s of the cure on evacuations; and to have recour&s;e to frequent bleeding upon ac|count of the inflammations of the <HI>vi&s;cera;</HI> endeavour|ing at the &s;ame time by repeated cathartics to di&s;charge the corrupted humours from the inte&s;tines: but when experience had convinced me that the bark was both a &s;afe and effectual remedy in the&s;e circum&s;tances, I then plainly perceived that &s;uch profu&s;e evacuations were unnece&s;&s;ary if not prejudicial; and of late years, as I &s;eldom omitted to bleed and purge once or twice, I rarely repeated either operation oftener.</P>
<P>In &s;emitertians and remittents, which approach to the nature of continual fevers, I give a cathartic early in the morning of that day on which the &s;ymptoms are mo&s;t moderate; ha&s;tening the operation with gly&s;ters (if occa&s;ion requires) &s;o that it may be fini&s;hed before the middle of the day, about which time the patient commonly grows wor&s;e. In true &s;imple and double tertians there is generally an interval every morning, in which the purgative may be admini&s;tered, but that
<PB N="117" REF="033590_0120_0FF794DBCBD1E4E8">
which &s;ucceeds the wor&s;t fit, is the mo&s;t proper, as it is more calm, and continues longer than the other.</P>
<P>Proper evacuations being premi&s;ed, if po&s;&s;ible, within the fir&s;t four or five days of the di&s;temper, I carefully examine the condition of the patient, during the third revolution, and determine accordingly in what manner it will be nece&s;&s;ary to proceed. If the paroxi&s;ms of that revolution be neither longer, nor attended with more threatening &s;ymptoms, than tho&s;e of the &s;econd: if the patient pre&s;erves his &s;trength, bears his illne&s;s ea&s;ily, and &s;igns of concoction appear in the urine, I frequently tru&s;t the whole bu&s;ine&s;s to nature, which commonly terminates the fever about the fourth or fifth revolution, and, for the mo&s;t part, with an increa&s;e of &s;ome of the natural evacuations; &s;o that &s;weats, cloudy or thick urine, and bilious &s;tools often &s;uper|vene, and &s;ometimes a &s;pontaneous efflux of &s;pittle, or a copious expectoration of pituitous matter.</P>
<P>But if the paroxi&s;m on the fifth day be evidently the longe&s;t and mo&s;t fevere that has happened; if it be at|tended with any doubtful or dangerous &s;ymptoms; if the &s;ick become giddy, feeble, and languid; in the&s;e ca&s;es, without delay, I have recour&s;e to the bark; and the &s;ame evening, as &s;oon as the &s;weats have procured a remi&s;&s;ion, I order two &s;cruples or a drachm of it in powder to be given every two or three hours, or every hour and a half, &s;o that five or &s;ix drachms may be taken before next day at noon, with as little interrup|tion to their &s;leep as may be; and the a&s;&s;i&s;tants are &s;trictly enjoined to comply punctually with the&s;e direc|tions, le&s;t if this interval e&s;cape, we &s;hould not after|wards have a favourable opportunity of giving a &s;uf|ficient quantity of the medicine, as the fits about this period of the di&s;ea&s;e are wont to become double, &s;ub-intrant, or continual. Yet it is not always in our power to put an immediate &s;top to the fever by this means: On the contrary, do what we can, it will of|ten proceed in its career, and, in &s;pite of all our at|tempts, run ob&s;tinately on to the &s;eventh or ninth day&punc; But the great advantage which accrues from the early
<PB N="118" REF="033590_0121_0FF794DE495000B0">
u&s;e of the bark, is, that it invigorates the powers of the body, it prevents or removes the dangerous &s;ymp|toms, and in tertians, which of their own accord would continue to the end of the &s;econd week or longer, it brings on a cri&s;is &s;ooner, and with much le&s;s di&s;tur|bance. In &s;hort, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of one of the greate&s;t promoters of medical knowledge in this age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MONRO on the U&s;e of the Bark in Small Pox and Gargrenes, Med.

Ob&s;. no&s;tr. de Aere &amp; Morb. Epidem. Vol. II.

intermittent.&mdash;Thus we often &s;ee per&s;ons of low &s;pirits, and a leucophlegmetic habit of body, rai&s;ed in|to a feveri&s;h di&s;po&s;ition by the u&s;e of warm invigorating medicines, chalybeates, &amp;c. And if this turn of nature, be well managed, it generally ends in their perfect recovery. If you can change a &s;low nervous fever into a regular intermittent, you &s;oon cure your pa|tient.</P>
<P>"It is commonly noted, that if the fever, from a re|gular tertian, runs into a &s;emi-tertian, or quotidian, or greatly anticipates the time of the regular paroxi&s;m; a remittent, or continual fever is forthwith the con&s;e|quence.&mdash;And this is too often effected by a very hot regimen, or a too ha&s;ty u&s;e of the bark. Indeed we very frequently &s;ee that quotidians, and double tertians, (which, by the bye, are oftentimes the &s;ame thing) will not bear the bark, at the beginning; till the &s;aline draughts, proper diluting attenuants, and in &s;ome ca&s;es, bleeding, purging, and vomiting have been made u&s;e of. In truth, I never think it prudent, in &s;uch kinds of intermittents, to give the bark, in any form, till af|ter four or five paroxi&s;ms at lea&s;t, and after having drawn more or le&s;s blood from per&s;ons pretty much inclined to the plethoric; and this method is more e&s;|pecially to be ob&s;erved in vernal agues.</P>
<P>If an intermittent runs into an inflammatory con|tinual fever, bleeding and a gentle cool purge will &s;oon reduce it to its type.</P>
<P>But as &s;ome intermittents are apt to run up into an inflammatory fever, far the greater number, e&s;pecially in the autumnal &s;ea&s;on, are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ink into low irregular remittents, putrid or &s;low nervous fevers. It is not a very rare thing to find a quotidian fall into a tertian, thence into a quartan, and at la&s;t end in a drop&s;y; and this particularly in &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons and places. This evidently &s;hews that the fibres grow more and more enervated and the blood very vapid and watery. Even vernal tertians, which oftentimes cure them&s;elves in a favourable &s;ea&s;on, prove many times exceeding ob&s;tinate in wet, rainy &s;ummers, and the patients are exceeding apt to relap&s;e on the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ions: This
<PB N="120" REF="033590_0123_0FF794E33980BFB8">
was particularly ob&s;ervable in the wet, cold &s;ummers of 1734 and 1735.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Ob&s;. no&s;tr. de Aere &amp; Morbis Epidemic. Vol. I.</NOTE></P>
<P>Perhaps it is the winter-cold, bracing up the fibres, that commonly puts a &s;top to agues in that &s;ea&s;on; for it hath been noted, that they are often very &s;tubborn in a warm moi&s;t winter.</P>
<P>Improper evacuations by bleeding and purging, an unwhole&s;ome, gro&s;s glutinous diet, vapid ropy drinks, as &s;tagnant heavy water, foul beer, and the like, ren|der the&s;e agues very anomalous, ob&s;tinate and dange|rous, and make them frequently degenerate into ma|lignant, putrid, or &s;low nervous fevers; otherwi&s;e they end in drop&s;ies, jaundice, or univer&s;al ob&s;tructions of the vi&s;cera of the abdomen, and frequently in di&s;ea&s;es of the genus nervo&s;um. In a word whatever takes down the &s;pring of the fibres too much, and weakens the cra&s;is of the blood, will be productive of the&s;e mi&s;chiefs; and this e&s;pecially, when due per&s;piration is frequently interrupted by cold damp air, want of due exerci&s;e, gro&s;s heavy &s;limy diet, as fi&s;h, lettuce, cucum|bers, and other watery in&s;ipid fruits, which are known to &s;uppre&s;s the per&s;piration greatly.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations then evidently &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing a warm, invigorating, attenuating regimen in the cure of agues, which affect per&s;ons of a lax ha|bit of body, and a poor thin blood; in a particular manner when a wet, foggy atmo&s;phere prevails. Un|der &s;uch circum&s;tances the cortex of Peru, however good and carefully cho&s;en, frequently proves ineffectu|al, unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted with proper alexipharmacs, as rad. &s;erpentar. virgin. Contrayerv. myrrh, camphire, &amp;c. After four or five paroxi&s;ms, warm chalybeates may be added with very great &s;ucce&s;s. But never be too ha&s;ty in giving the bark, or chalybeates, where the patient hath a yellow ca&s;t of the countenance, a ten&s;e abdomen, and a very co&s;tive habit of body. In which ca&s;e mer|curial, &s;aponaceous deob&s;truents with rhubarb, aloetics,
<PB N="121" REF="033590_0124_0FF794E4E8DCFFA0">
regenerate or &s;oluble tartar, &s;hould be premi&s;ed; nay they may in &s;ome ca&s;es be very conveniently joined with the bark.</P>
<P>THE eminent Morgagni, Pre&s;ident of the Univer&s;ity at Padua, remarks that "In malignant and epidemical fevers, it is not of &s;o much importance to counteract the fever, as it is to counteract that malignant quality which is joined thereto; and which is, to the great in|crea&s;e of the difficulty in &s;uch a counteraction, almo&s;t peculiar in every con&s;titution.</P>
<P>And certainly, unle&s;s you endeavour to overcome this malignant quality for the mo&s;t part; you do the &s;ame thing, as if you &s;hould endeavour to overcome a fever, which had its origin from the bite of a viper, by antife|brile remedies; without paying any regard to the poi|&s;on infu&s;ed; to make u&s;e of the &s;ame example, which I perceive, from the hi&s;tory of the royal academy of &s;cien|ces at Paris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A. 1753.</NOTE>, the celebrated Du Que&s;nay has made u&s;e of al&s;o.</P>
<P>For which rea&s;on, we ought the more to give thanks to the providence of Almighty God, that, in &s;o very great an ob&s;curity, and variety, of ca&s;es, it has favoured us with a remedy, the powers of which, in overcoming &s;ome dangerous fevers at lea&s;t, is proved by experience; though the method in which it acts is &s;omewhat ob|&s;cure; I mean the Peruvian bark.</P>
<P>For this remedy, although &s;ome of the&s;e fevers &s;eem to have one kind of malignity joined with them, and &s;ome another; as appears from the external cau&s;es and &s;ymptoms; can neverthele&s;s counteract the one and the other equally; and &s;ubdue their malignity; as I have learned both from my own ob&s;ervations, and tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>Nor was the matter which has begun to be thrown out of the blood, either upon the &s;kin, or about the
<PB N="122" REF="033590_0125_0FF794E96CCE0FF0">
joints, by any means repugnant to the &s;alubrious effica|cy of the bark; not even when repelled inwards, from thence, by the force of the external cold.</P>
<P>For a very eminent cardinal was cured by the bark of a malignant fever, into which he had fallen, in con|&s;equence of &s;uch a repul&s;ion; as I have written to you on a former occa&s;ion:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. 49. n. 80. &amp; &s;eqq.</NOTE> And that very famous man Haller was al&s;o cured thereby of a very violent fever, which had come upon him in con&s;equence of a gout being thus repelled; and which was attended with an ery&s;ipelas of the face likewi&s;e: and this he relates in the remarks that he has made upon the hundred and fifty-&s;econd di&s;putation, among tho&s;e which he has col|lected and publi&s;hed, as "contributing to the hi&s;tory and cure of di&s;ea&s;es."</P>
<P>For it is pa&s;t a doubt, that the&s;e things are not &s;o much to be attended to, as this which I then &s;poke of; I mean, whether the fevers are periodical: that is, whe|ther they are wont to have an intermi&s;&s;ion, or a remi&s;|&s;ion at lea&s;t; &s;o as to afford us room to hope, that, by a timely and proper u&s;e of the bark, both the fevers them&s;elves, and their attendant malignity, will be over|come.</P>
<P>Nor does the bark only overcome what is febrile; but even that which is not febrile; &s;o that it does but recur periodically: although this effect is not &s;o gene|ral, when the di&s;order is without any manife&s;t fever: and as we have already &s;aid, that this has been ob&s;erv|ed, &s;o we might now al&s;o confirm it by a more recent, and more clear ob&s;ervation of Stephanus We&s;zpre|mus; I mean, of an equally &s;evere, and ob&s;tinate, he|micrania being overcome by the &s;ame remedy, after having been already exacerbated every fourth hour, for two weeks together; and not having remitted till after two hours.</P>
<P>And if this ob&s;ervation, which was made and pub|li&s;hed in the year 1756, could have exi&s;ted fifty years before; when I at length with difficulty put to flight
<PB N="123" REF="033590_0126_0FF794EB020B8F40">
that very &s;evere hemicrania, which returned every day at the &s;ame hour, by the pre&s;cription of a number of different remedies; I &s;hould certainly have made u&s;e of none more readily, and perhaps more &s;ucce&s;sfully than this; notwith&s;tanding I had been ignorant of the mode in which it produces its effects.</P>
<P>And I could wi&s;h the malignant and epidemical fe|vers, whereof we had begun to &s;peak, were all perio|dical, as they are almo&s;t all of them joined with a various and ob&s;cure force of malignity; we &s;hould then have in this cortex a medicine, which, although we might be ignorant in what manner it operates, we might neverthele&s;s try with a rea&s;onable hope of &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>But they are very often &s;ynochae, or continual fevers; and &s;uch as, if you di&s;&s;ect the bodies of tho&s;e who have been carried off by them, either &s;how nothing, as I have &s;aid in the beginning, which di&s;covers the peculiar nature, and &s;ituation, of the principal di&s;|ea&s;e; or &s;how con&s;iderable and evident injuries of the vi&s;cera indeed, but &s;uch as, if you compare them with tho&s;e &s;ymptoms that have been ob&s;erved in the patients while living, you will naturally conceive to have been produced by &s;ome other latent and principal di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>That is to &s;ay, by way of example, an inflammatory fever of the vi&s;cera, after di&s;&s;ection, &s;hows the vi&s;cera to have been inflamed, whether it is benign, or malig|nant; but in the living patient if it he benign, it is alle|viated by repeated blood-lettings: If malignant, it be|comes wor&s;e, and is very &s;oon fatal.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of the difference is another principal di&s;|ea&s;e being joined to it; as in that fever at Roan de|&s;cribed by the celebrated Malouin, which, about the end of the year 1753, carried off a great number, in a very &s;hort time, in that place.</P>
<P>For by rea&s;on of the malignant acrimony of the mat|ter which irritated the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, that in|flammation was at length produced, which was found in tho&s;e vi&s;cera, and was already degenerated into a gan|grene: the other internal parts being unhurt, and par|ticularly
<PB N="124" REF="033590_0127_0FF794EC940FE510">
tho&s;e of the head; which otherwi&s;e had been troubled with a pain, that aro&s;e from a con&s;ent of parts, and increa&s;ed every day &s;o as to bring on a delirium.</P>
<P>The college of phy&s;icians at Roan, therefore, pru|dently and u&s;efully determined, that the inflammation was not then to be attended to; as it either did not exi&s;t in the beginning, or aro&s;e accidentally in the pro|gre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e: but that every method mu&s;t be taken to eliminate that very acrid matter from the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages; for from this, if it were left within, a per|manent irritation is much more to be feared, than a tran&s;ient one from purgative remedies, e&s;pecially when they are of a milder kind."</P>

<HEAD>The Con&s;titution of the Air.</HEAD>
<P>"TO the violent heats in &s;ummer 1754 &s;ucceed|ed a hot autumn; in the beginning of winter, we had either perpetual &s;howers or fogs, and the &s;ea&s;on warm. The weather remained thus till the third day of the following year, when there &s;uddenly came on that violent cold, which by the 5th and 6th of January grew &s;o inten&s;e over all Europe almo&s;t, that it fell but little &s;hort of that remarkable and &s;ince unparalleled fro&s;t of the year 1709. It continued very &s;evere to the 14th of the month, then it abated &s;omewhat, though the &s;ame fro&s;t &s;till la&s;ted till the 20th of February. March was &s;howery; April hot, which is very uncommon in our country, that happening at that time to attend pa|tients in the &s;mall-pox, I was obliged to renew the air
<PB N="125" REF="033590_0128_0FF794EE439BA908">
in the chambers from all quarters, and moi&s;ten the boards frequently with cold water. In the beginning of May, the &s;evere cold returned with a northerly wind, and was very pernicious to the tender leaves and blo&s;&s;oms. The weather was un&s;ettled during the whole month. Violent heat commenced with the month of June, and continued to the 23d of July.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e was not equally violent in all. With regard to its vehemence, it may be accurately enough divided into three cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t was attended with no danger, unle&s;s by being neglected it degenerated into a chronic di&s;temper. The &s;econd, though not void of danger, yet as far as I know never proved mortal, except when either by wrong management, or no care at all, it was changed into the third. The third cla&s;s was very rare, but always very threatening, and &s;ome|times fatal.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>Patients of the fir&s;t cla&s;s complained fir&s;t of a la&s;&s;i|tude, weakne&s;s, weight particularly of the head, loath|ing of food, an unea&s;y and almo&s;t con&s;tant &s;en&s;ation of cold, in&s;omuch that during the dog-days they would go with great plea&s;ure to a kitchen fire; they were drow&s;y without &s;leeping; their mouth &s;limy; and their tongue foul with a whiti&s;h-yellow tenacious covering. After three or four days, &s;ometimes later, a &s;hivering came on towards evening, which harra&s;&s;ed them for an hour or two, &s;ometimes longer: this was followed by a heat not vehement indeed, but trouble&s;ome and pun|gent, which communicated a &s;mart heat to the fingers of the phy&s;ician; in &s;ome this continued till morning, and then gradually went off without any &s;en&s;ible ex|cretion; in others after &s;ome hours a gentle &s;weat came on, for I never &s;aw it profu&s;e, but it did not bring that placid interval, which &s;ucceeds the &s;weats of true in|termittents. I heard frequent complaints of the head in the time of the paroxi&s;m, but none of the che&s;t. In the fir&s;t days the pul&s;e hardly differed from a natu|ral one, except by its weakne&s;s; in the time of the &s;hivering it was very &s;mall, during the heat quick, con|tracted,
<PB N="126" REF="033590_0129_0FF794F1A0BF06B0">
and frequent, yet not exceeding an hundred pul&s;ations in a minute in an adult woman. When the paroxi&s;m was ended, the patients remained in the &s;ame &s;tate of langour, which I de&s;cribed before, ri&s;ing indeed out of bed, but unfit for all kinds of employ|ment, torpid, lazy, dragging them&s;elves from their chair to the bed, and from the bed to the chair, and not walking without reluctance. The paroxi&s;m re|turned every day, but frequently varied from its fir&s;t hour; neither was it always &s;imilar to it&s;elf in other circum&s;tances. Nay, there were &s;ome patients, who without regard to any period, &s;hivered and grew hot often in one day; I knew &s;everal in whom I could hardly &s;u&s;pect any exacerbation, unle&s;s from a little more anxiety and debility in the evening, but they were never free from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the langour, nor were they &s;ooner cured than others. There were &s;ome, particularly of the older women, who &s;carcely complained of any thing el&s;e be&s;ide debility, loathing of food, and want of &s;leep. Some were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with a pain of their &s;tomach; and what was common to them all, they did not recover till after &s;ome weeks. There were &s;everal patients whom, no &s;uch violent &s;ymptoms appearing as required the &s;peedy aid of a phy&s;ician, I did not &s;ee till fifteen days after they had been &s;eized, and I found little or no difference in their &s;ymptoms from the others, &s;ave that the heat and de|bility had increa&s;ed, and by that time brought them in danger of a &s;low fever. In the beginning of the di&s;|temper, the belly was bound, towards the end a little more lax; the urine during the interval was thin and crude, in the violence of the paroxi&s;m a little more red; upon the decline of the di&s;ea&s;e it became con|cocted with a &s;ediment. I found very few who had much thir&s;t. Boys, women, and old people were prin|cipally &s;ubject to this &s;pecies, men very rarely. Old men e&s;caped the &s;econd. The third attacked only young men in the flower of life, from 15 to 40, and generally carried off the more robu&s;t.</P>
<P>The beginning of the &s;econd cla&s;s was not very dif|ferent from that of the fir&s;t; but after &s;ome days every
<PB N="127" REF="033590_0130_0FF794F42767BCF0">
thing was more aggravated, the weakne&s;s increa&s;ed, a nau&s;ea followed the loathing of food, but the &s;ick very rarely vomited &s;pontaneou&s;ly; the heat was more bri&s;k, and the paroxi&s;ms more violent; at the begin|ning they did &s;hiver, though gently, but afterwards &s;carce any coldne&s;s was perceived before the parox|i&s;ms; but the heat grew gradually more inten&s;e, <HI>gene|rally in the evening;</HI> the pul&s;e was more frequent, and upon trial, in &s;ome per&s;ons I was able to count one hundred and &s;ixteen &s;trokes in a minute. At this time &s;everal were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with mo&s;t acute head-achs. Af|ter three, four, or five hours the fever remitted, and, as in the fir&s;t &s;pecies, without a &s;weat. Nor were &s;weats very de&s;ireable, for upon the decline of the di&s;|temper they did good, but during its height, both in this, and in the third &s;pecies they were prejudicial; for the more profu&s;e they were, the more &s;evere was the &s;ucceeding paroxi&s;m. The patient had not a perfect interval, and this was the pathognomic &s;ymptom, whereby we might di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;econd &s;pecies from the fir&s;t. The urine was &s;mall in quantity, thin, and reddi&s;h; the natural &s;tools few and &s;mall, the tongue dry, and covered with a yellow mucus; they had &s;carce any &s;leep, but what was turbulent, with anxiety, and not at all refre&s;hing; the thir&s;t was more trou|ble&s;ome than in the fir&s;t &s;pecies, and yet not &s;o great as might have been expected from the heat; the pa|tient was quickly <HI>emaciated with a pale yellow face.</HI> The paroxi&s;ms were not &s;o irregular as in the fir&s;t &s;pecies. By bad management the tran&s;ition was ea&s;y from the &s;econd to the third cla&s;s or degree.</P>
<P>The third cla&s;s or degree, appeared to be a di&s;tinct di&s;temper by it&s;elf; for in &s;everal, although they made u&s;e of the be&s;t remedies from the fir&s;t attack of the di&s;|ea&s;e, and their di&s;order &s;eemed to be re&s;trained by them, yet on the &s;ixth, &s;eventh, or eighth day, all the more alarming &s;ymptoms came on. When I had left a per&s;on in the evening with the hopes of a milder pa|roxi&s;m, I often found him next morning dangerou&s;ly ill after a &s;evere night, with a frequent and very quick pul&s;e, <HI>a beginning delirium, and a flatulent &s;welling of the

abdomen, which two &s;ymptoms di&s;tingui&s;hed the third cla&s;s from the &s;econd;</HI> then the paroxi&s;ms &s;carcely any lon|ger pre&s;erved the lea&s;t order in their attacks, but came on irregularly at all times; the pul&s;e became &s;o frequent, that the &s;trokes could hardly be counted; there was a general &s;ub&s;ultus of the tendons; the anx|iety and re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s were without intermi&s;&s;ion, the eyes fierce, twinkling and gummy: the delirium increa&s;ing, made &s;ome bri&s;k, and approached almo&s;t to a phrenzy, in others it was more calm, and re&s;embled a lethargy, in both ca&s;es it was dangerous: The fir&s;t talked in|ce&s;&s;antly, the others were &s;ilent and moro&s;e, and made not the lea&s;t complaint of the di&s;temper, though by holding their hand frequently to their forehead, it was plain they had a violent head-ach. When the phy|&s;ician a&s;ked how they did, they looked &s;tedfa&s;tly at him and an&s;wered in a bri&s;k tone of voice, <HI>Very well.</HI> They did not know their friends, the flatulent &s;welling in|crea&s;ed daily, e&s;pecially about the hypochondria. The breath grew &s;hort, &s;o that they almo&s;t con&s;tantly panted; a cough was an uncommon &s;ymptom; their &s;tools were irregular, liquid, fat, colliquative, and <HI>&s;ometimes bilious, which was good;</HI> often white and frothy, which was always a very bad &s;ign, for it implied the retention of the morbid matter, and a &s;pa&s;modic di&s;order in the motions of the inte&s;tines. Some few however were &s;eized with a purging at the beginning; nor did things go better with them: Nay, I &s;aw a young woman in this di&s;temper, which proved fatal, who, as I was told, had been afflicted with a &s;erous di&s;charge by &s;tool for two months before the di&s;ea&s;e. In general a purging, which came on at the beginning, was hurtful, for it was always &s;ymptomatic; and although it was very fetid, yet it left the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e untouched; &s;o that with the increa&s;e of the&s;e evacuations, the di&s;|ea&s;e grew wor&s;e, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the by-&s;tanders. The urine was always crude; in other re&s;pects differ|ent every day, white, thin, oily, turbid, re&s;embling that of cattle, red and colliquative; if there was any cloud it always occupied the upper part, which Hippocrates condemns. From paralytic &s;pincters and the delirium,

HOERHAV.

In this, as well as the other &s;pecies, the paroxi&s;ms with regard to their vehemence, followed the form of a tertian, &s;o that I have always ob&s;erved the &s;ymptoms more aggravated every other day, and they died on the wor&s;t day, from the &s;eventeenth to the twenty-fifth day.

<HEAD>Method of Cure.</HEAD>
<P>At fir&s;t for &s;ome time, I u&s;ed ipecacuan, but I pre|&s;ently found that this celebrated root had not in this ca&s;e &s;ufficient force; it had be&s;ides this bad property, that after the evacuation was over, it left the patient co&s;tive and &s;ometimes thir&s;ty; I was therefore glad to change it for the emetic tartar, which I hardly ever dropped after that: the do&s;e, being proportioned to the age and other indications, was di&s;&s;olved in eight or ten ounces of water, with an addition of a &s;ixth part of &s;yrup of capillaire. I directed the whole to be drank at two, three, or four draughts; and this method of dividing the potion &s;ucceeded happily in &s;o great a va|riety of &s;ick people as I attended, the generality of who&s;e particular con&s;titutions, I was till then entirely unacquainted with. There was another advantage at|tending this medicine, that being palatable it was not in the lea&s;t nau&s;eous, even to children and more deli|cate people. I &s;ometimes made an addition of man|na, though the &s;olution of tartar alone &s;eldom failed to procure &s;tools, which I always reckoned of great importance; for be&s;ides, that in this way the much larger quantity of morbid matter is evacuated, it is the method nature points out for di&s;charding the relics of the morbid matter. The effect of the remedy was, that generally in little more than half an hour; that is, &s;ome time after the &s;econd draught, there was an inclina|tion to retch, which was followed by vomiting; and if the quantity of the di&s;charge was judged &s;ufficient, the remainder of the potion was not u&s;ed; if not, it was drank; the vomiting brought up vi&s;cous matter mixed with yellow, bitter bile; then followed &s;tools or liquid, yellow, fetid excrements. I often encouraged the vomiting, by plentiful draughts of hydromel; when it cea&s;ed, I promoted copious &s;tools by giving at a &s;poonful each time what remained of the potion diluted in a large vehicle. Thus after the evacuation was

over, the patient found him&s;elf better, with regard to his anxiety, debility, and &s;leep. The &s;ame method was followed by that celebrated practitioner, Walca|renghi, and has been recommended to po&s;terity by G. E. Stahl, <HI>for the method of cure, adequate to the remo|val of the peccant matter in the&s;e fevers, can be no other than vomiting and purging</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De febre bilio&s;a, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t evacuation refrigerating laxative re|medies were pre&s;cribed; and I never failed to ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e medicines, which before had hardly proved cathartic, having their force increa&s;ed by the diminu|tion of the morbid excrements, produced at this time two or three &s;tools every day, always of a putrid na|ture. The langour was gradually dimini&s;hed, and al&s;o the length of the paroxi&s;m. After three or four days, if a plentiful di&s;charge of urine afforded the &s;igns of a concoction, we had recour&s;e to purging by &s;alts, man|na, tamarinds, and now and then a &s;mall do&s;e of &s;enna. Sometimes when there was rea&s;on to expect that &s;tools would be ea&s;ily procured, it &s;ufficed to di&s;|&s;olve two ounces of manna with &s;ome &s;alt in their common drink in the morning; and a coipious di&s;charge of excrements followed, from that, there &s;carcely re|mained the form of a paroxi&s;m; the &s;kin grew &s;oft, their &s;leep became compo&s;ed; they no longer loathed their food, though they had not yet any de&s;ire for it. The natural heat was more &s;lowly re&s;tored, and they were almo&s;t always cold. Then they took only a do&s;e or two of their medicines every day; all the &s;ymp|toms went off gradually, the bilious &s;tools which were &s;o &s;alutary &s;till continued, and both evacuated the morbid matter, and &s;hewed that the vi&s;cera recovered their tone; for it was with us, as the famous Galla|rotti ob&s;erved it to be at Cremona, <HI>we could &s;afely hope for a complete termination of the fever, only while the &s;tools continued bilious.</HI> And indeed if we fell &s;hort of this happy appearance, I was obliged both to give the re|frigerents longer, and in a larger do&s;e, and to repeat the cathartic a third time, nay &s;ometimes, but very
<PB N="132" REF="033590_0135_0FF794FFB654F750">
rarely, a fourth time. I do not remember an in&s;tance of a fifth purging being u&s;ed. In lax con&s;titutions, which laboured more under a vi&s;co&s;ity than acrimony, I &s;ometimes avoided aqueous liquors after the fir&s;t purging, and ordered a potion compo&s;ed of a large do&s;e of tartar. regenerat. a &s;mall quantity of elixir pro|prietat. with the di&s;tilled waters of &s;uccory and citron-peel, and compound &s;yrup of &s;uccory, adding oxy|mel, when the circum&s;tances required it.</P>
<P>They who refu&s;ed medicines, and after the fir&s;t vo|mit laid a&s;ide all remedies unle&s;s perhaps toa&s;t and water or lemonade, of whom there were many, having the morbid matter le&s;&s;ened by means of the diet, which their loathing directed them to, gradually got the bet|ter of the fever indeed, but they recovered their health &s;lowly, and imperfectly, and &s;everal of them were obli|ged after &s;ome months to have recour&s;e to medicines.</P>
<P>If it was dangerous to give over evacuations too &s;oon, it was al&s;o dangerous to continue them too long; and a man would be mi&s;erably deceived, if he ima|gined they were to be per&s;i&s;ted in, till the appetite and &s;trength were entirely re&s;tored. The inappetency and debility aro&s;e in the beginning of the di&s;temper from the cacochymy oppre&s;&s;ing the &s;tomach and primae viae; and now at the end of the di&s;ea&s;e they were owing to a laxity of the fibres, the languor of the &s;ecretions, and a defect of good juices in the body. We mu&s;t therefore here attend to the caution of Boerhaave, <HI>what does good at one time, may yet be hurtful, if given at another, though in the &s;ame di&s;temper,</HI> and we had a &s;ad proof of this by experience. For while &s;ome continued opening medicines with a view of di&s;charging the the morbid matter, which they blamed for the&s;e com|plaints, I have &s;een the di&s;ea&s;e protracted, the debility increa&s;ed, and the exce&s;&s;ive irritation of the ga&s;tric and inte&s;tinal nerves followed by the whole train of irre|gular &s;pa&s;modic &s;ymptoms. The&s;e I never ob&s;erved, if the cathartics were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in proper time, and a &s;uitable diet with exerci&s;e in the country, and &s;ome &s;trengthening medicines were made u&s;e of.

<P>Being called in the middle of the night to vi&s;it a gentleman with a biliary ardent fever, I pre&s;cribed a cly&s;ter, and a draught of barley-water, which was at hand, with &s;ome drops of Hoffman's anodyne mineral liquor, which after agitations of mind, I have found an excellent remedy by drinking &s;ome tepid liqour after it. The &s;ymptoms abated, and in the morning I could &s;afely give manna, tamarinds, and a &s;mall do&s;e of eme|tic tartar, di&s;&s;olved in a decoction of gra&s;s, of which he was to take three ounces every hour, and after this do&s;e was fini&s;hed, the &s;ame decoction of gra&s;s with juice of &s;orrel and citron. Returning in the evening, for the patient lived in the country, I found he had drank &s;carce half the pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing draught, and but little of the acid pti&s;an, but he had taken the anodyme mi|neral liquor frequently, he had gone thrice to &s;tool, and the di&s;charge was bilious, his head which I left clear when I went away in the morning, was now con|fu&s;ed; and his pul&s;e very quick: the following night he pa&s;&s;ed without &s;leep, and the delirium increa&s;ed. In the morning I pre&s;cribed the &s;ame laxative pti&s;an, and another of barley water, an acid &s;yrup, and &s;pirit of nitre, and &s;trong &s;inapi&s;ms to the &s;oles of his feet. I took my leave, and every thing was &s;et a&s;ide, a con|&s;ulation is talked of, which met in the afternoon; in|&s;tead of the fore-mentioned drinks, milk-whey with tamarinds is pre&s;cribed, in&s;tead of the &s;inapi&s;ms, bli&s;|ters to the legs; next day every thing grew wor&s;e, no evacuations followed; the day after there was another con&s;ultation at &s;ix in the morning; he laboured under the greate&s;t re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and a &s;trong phrenitic dele|rium, his pul&s;e as before, frequent, &s;mall, and quick, which was very bad, <HI>for phren&s;ies with a &s;trong ten&s;e and &s;low pul&s;e are curable, hardly with a &s;mall and quick one.</HI> Upon account of the delirium he is bled, which I re|mon&s;trated again&s;t in vain, he grows more outrageous, and his hypocondres become ten&s;e.

faints, and the delirium abated a little from his weak|ne&s;s, for it returned again with his &s;trength; &s;everal do&s;es of an emetic medicine are given, but hardly any evacuation followed, he had a very bad night. Next day the re&s;ult of the fourth con&s;ultation was, giving a &s;trong cathartic; his pul&s;e was hardly perceptible, with a &s;trong delirium: he had no &s;tool; in the af|ternoon a &s;harp cly&s;ter is injected, and there followed an immen&s;e di&s;charge; and by continued faintings an end was put to the life of this worthy man. I leave it to the judgment of phy&s;icians, whether the former method was preferable to the latter. Death certainly could not follow with more cruel &s;ymptoms, nor more rapidly; all indications with regard to the &s;trength were neglected, nor were any other remedies admini&s;|tered, but &s;uch who&s;e futility I have demon&s;trated.

<P>A German &s;hoemaker, of Zurich, if I remember right, was &s;eized with the epidemic fever in the month of October 1755. I was &s;ent for on the third day, and ordered a vomit on the fourth, and other &s;uitable me|dicines; but the ob&s;tinate man drank very little, being aver&s;e to it, nor did he ob&s;erve &s;uch a diet as I had pre&s;cribed; on the eighth day I purged him; on the tenth the tumid inflation was &s;o great, that the &s;kin of the abdomen began to grow red from the violent di&s;|ten&s;ion: his breath was very &s;hort from the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of the de&s;cent of the diaphragm, his pul&s;e was
<PB N="135" REF="033590_0138_0FF7950821ABA100">
&s;mall, and what &s;urprized me, he was almo&s;t free from a delirium. Being afraid of the mi&s;chievous con&s;e|quences from a compre&s;&s;ion of all the bowels, and an ob&s;tructed re&s;piration; finding no other cau&s;e but air rarefied by the bile, who&s;e putrefaction he had not &s;ufficiently corrected by drinking, and being &s;atisfied from feeling the abdomen before, that there was no ob&s;truction prior to the di&s;temper; and having to do with a &s;ullen patient who would hardly conform to rules, and employing my thoughts in &s;earching for a remedy, which would mo&s;t quickly &s;trengthen the fibres, re&s;train the flatulency, and &s;top the putrefac|tion; I recollected the ob&s;ervations of the antients and &s;ome moderns, and my own experience with re&s;pect to cold water. Having weighed them all carefully, I or|dered a linnen cloth, twice doubled, dipt in cold &s;pring water, to be applied over all the abdomen, and to be changed every quarter of an hour, and the patient to drink as often, three ounces of the &s;ame water. In two hours the &s;welling of his belly &s;ub&s;ided, his re&s;piration became ea&s;ier; in le&s;s than three hours a flight colic came on, which produced many large bilious &s;tools, with a continued di&s;charge of wind; the linnen cloths were taken away, the following night he &s;lept, and next day his belly was &s;oft, the fever much abated, and in a &s;hort time he got well, without changing his drink, which I often found exceeding &s;alutary, and it is to be lamented that the u&s;e of water has grown ob&s;olete. We give nothing now, unle&s;s it be prepared, and often &s;poiled by the apothecary's art. The wi&s;er antients, when the concoction was perfected gave cold water, an excellent &s;trengthener, and as much of it as the patient was willing to drink, as appears from the works of Hippocrates, Aretaeus, Galen, Alexander, Caelius, Aurelianus, and others. Galen has even re|proached his co-temporaries for neglecting the u&s;e of cold water, and calls them Hydrophobi. Among the moderns Fernelius, Hoffman, Van Swieten, Kloekhof, Grainger, and many others have pre&s;cribed cold wa|ter, and added cautions for its u&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>Of Bleeding in Bilious Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>Tho&s;e people who are fond of venae&s;ection, attribute every di&s;ea&s;e to the blood, and are ince&s;&s;antly talking of a plethora and &s;tagnation, and omit bleeding in no di&s;temper, will be amazed, that I have not made the lea&s;t mention of it, though we frequently had heat, dry|ne&s;s of the &s;kin, head-ach, a violent delirium, and acute fever, which might &s;eem to require &s;uch an evacuation. But it is a &s;ad misfortune to tho&s;e, who&s;e phy&s;icians make no enquiry after the cau&s;e, and are forward to &s;top all violent fevers by bleeding; for when the fever is increa&s;ed after the operation, it kills the patient. It is now four years &s;ince I publi&s;hed my opinion, that venae&s;ection is never u&s;eful when there is not a plethora; I may add, except in the beginning of an inflammatory di&s;temper, or while it is in a crude &s;tate, after violent exerci&s;e, being heated in the &s;un, a fall, and in peo|ple only, that &s;trictly are not plethoric, but robu&s;t, &s;anguineous and florid. And far from changing my mind &s;ince that time, I every day meet with the mi&s;|chievous con&s;equences of bleeding, where the&s;e con|ditions are not found. I grant that redundancy of blood may bring on di&s;tempers, which indicate bleed|ing; but the blood repels di&s;tempers that do not ari&s;e from it&s;elf; for the more a per&s;on has of that vital fluid, provided he is not plethoric, and that is not fre|quently the ca&s;e now-a-days, the better is his &s;ituation, and he is the more able to re&s;i&s;t the production and attacks of other di&s;ea&s;es. The more blood therefore he loo&s;es, the more obnoxious he will become to them; for it is ab&s;olutely certain, that an evacuation of blood from a &s;ound man who is not plethoric, di&s;po&s;es what is left to a cacochymy, depravity, and the di&s;orders proceeding from putrefaction.</P>
<P>It produces relaxation, and from thence debility with its con&s;equent di&s;orders, increa&s;es the irritability and paves the way for irregular commotions, as we learn by innumerable ob&s;ervations. For who has not &s;een bleeding followed by faintings, tremors flatulent &s;pa&s;ms as they are called, univer&s;al, or partial; a deli|rium, fever and convul&s;ions: when improperly u&s;ed to
<PB N="137" REF="033590_0140_0FF7950B667D93A0">
&s;everal girls for fainting &s;its, or hy&s;teric &s;uffocations, it has brought on real and dreadful convul&s;ive motions.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, would bleeding not abate at lea&s;t, the frequency of the pul&s;e, or the fever? I an|&s;wer it neither did nor could do this, for while it ag|gravates all the cau&s;es of the fever, it is difficult to con|ceive how it can mitigate the fever it&s;elf.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides the ob&s;ervations furni&s;hed by our epi|demic, we are not de&s;titute of others to confirm this theory. While I formerly attended the ho&s;pital of St. Eloy at Montpelier, a cu&s;tom prevailed there, which has been &s;trongly recommended by the practical phy&s;i|cians Gouraigne and Fifes, of bleeding in the height of the paroxi&s;m in intermittent and remittent fevers; and by this means I did not want opportunities of ob|&s;erving its effects in tho&s;e di&s;tempers, which among&s;t the people of Guiene almo&s;t always approach to the bilious kind. And I &s;olemnly profe&s;s that I &s;everal times found the pul&s;e quicker after bleeding; but I never could ob&s;erve that its frequency abated, or that the paroxi&s;m was &s;ooner terminated. Only the fol|lowing accident once happened to a young man, who laboured under a tertian; a little after he had been blooded the bandage was loo&s;ened by chance; in a &s;hort time he lo&s;t &s;uch a quantity of blood, that he had &s;everal fainting fits; his fever indeed pre&s;ently cea&s;ed, which I would have taken notice of, as con&s;onant to the doctrine of the ancients, but he was oppre&s;&s;ed with a languor of long continuance. Two phy&s;icians had the care of the ho&s;pital, and they attended a fortnight each by turns: when one of them, the younger man, treated bilious and putrid malignant fevers by bleed|ing, purging, and cooling medicines, many patients pre&s;ently lo&s;t the di&s;temper and their lives together. The other, an older man, pre&s;cribing a vomit at their fir&s;t appearance cured almo&s;t all, <HI>&s;peedily, &s;afely, and with ea&s;e to his patients.</HI></P>
<P>Aretaeus, Cel&s;us, Alexander every where agree with Hippocrates, that blood-letting is improper in bilious, or putrid fevers. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that Galen appears to differ, when in &s;everal places he pre&s;cribes bleeding

in putrid fevers; but any body, who reads over his works attentively may thus &s;olve the difficulty. He has wrote in &s;uch a manner as to advance &s;everal things often more from hyphothe&s;is than experience, he always &s;uppo&s;es a fulne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els, which is to be remov|ed, before other medicines are admini&s;tered; but Ga|len is mi&s;taken, and the building falls of cour&s;e when the foundation is de&s;troyed, and contradicting him&s;elf more than once whenever he lays a&s;ide the notion of a plethora, he proceeds upon no other doctrine than ours.

Among&s;t the moderns Fernelius coincides with our &s;entiments; <HI>Bleeding is bad in a re|gular tertian, becau&s;e it evacuates the u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary humour, and leaves behind the impure and noxious, for in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is fever the body is commonly wa&s;ted and the quantity of blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and the acrid bile, the very fuel of the fever abound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and ferments under the cavity of the liver; and as this is not removed by bleeding, con&s;equently the morbid matter is not le&s;&s;ened by it.

<P>I have hitherto oppo&s;ed bleeding in bilious di&s;tem|pers by rea&s;on and authority; we mu&s;t now con&s;ider what light was offered by our fever. Among the com|mon people I remember &s;everal, who died in a &s;hort time after bleedings quickly repeated.</P>
<P>Not to leave our work imperfect, it remains to be explained, why illu&s;trious phy&s;icians from antiquity
<PB N="139" REF="033590_0142_0FF7951047F73AF8">
down to our own times, have advi&s;ed bleeding in pu|trid fevers. I have already touched upon this point; the rea&s;on then is this, that there are two kinds of pu|trid fevers, &s;ome &s;imply putrid, in which phlebotomy is always hurtful, and which phy&s;icians who were truly &s;killed in the medical art, never attempted to cure by bleeding: but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that frequently men of fluent conver&s;ation, though de&s;titute of all accurate erudition acquire the character of famous practitioners; and however illu&s;trious they may be reckoned by their ignorant adherents, they are deemed by other phy&s;i|cians and impartial po&s;terity pe&s;tilent quacks, who&s;e de&s;tructive practice cannot be too cautiou&s;ly avoided.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is of that kind of putrid di&s;ea&s;es, where there is a concomitant inflammation, in which bleed|ing is an admirable remedy. We are not yet &s;uffici|ently acquainted with the theory of inflammation, or the manner in which its &s;timuli act, to be able to ex|plain, why it is &s;ometimes joined to a putrefaction, and &s;ometimes not; experience has convinced us that it is &s;o, and di&s;tinctly &s;hewn the pathognomic &s;ymptoms of both ca&s;es; and every day's practice affords many in&s;tances of it; they are to be found both el&s;ewhere, and in the elegant hi&s;tories of epidemics publi&s;hed by the illu&s;trious Huxham. How me to in&s;i&s;t a little upon that which the celebrated Pringle has &s;o accu|rately de&s;cribed. It is denominated indeed <HI>a bilious fever,</HI> but by an attentive con&s;ideration it will &s;oon appear, that the appellation is not comprehen&s;ive enough; the ingenious author &s;peaks &s;everal times of an inflammation of the &s;tomach; there was a true in|flammatory phrenzy, which he cured by antiphlogi&s;|tics. When the inflammation was removed, it re|mained to combat with the bilious colluvies, which he judiciou&s;ly di&s;lodged by vomits and purging, which in di&s;tempers purely inflammatory are found very hurtful. But the Edingburgh phy&s;ician had to deal with ro|bu&s;t &s;oldiers, young, and bred in the mountains, ac|cu&s;tomed to drink &s;pirituous liquors, and in fine, ob|noxious to all the cau&s;es of inflammation, and in whom it very ea&s;ily follows the application of a &s;timulus.

Thus the fir&s;t mi&s;chief of the putrid ferment was to produce an inflammation. If in &s;uch circum&s;tances it had been attempted to vomit or purge before the in|flammation was re&s;olved, it would have been attend|ed with the wor&s;t con&s;equences. Such a di&s;temper ought to be e&s;teemed and treated like an inflammation of the bowels."</P>
<P>Dr. SOLOMON DE MONCHY, of Rotterdam, in his E&s;&s;ay on the cau&s;es and cure of the u&s;ual di&s;ea&s;es in voyages to the We&s;t-Indies, tran&s;lated from the Dutch philo&s;ophical tran&s;actions, and publi&s;hed at London in the year 1762, remarks that, "it has long &s;ince been the ob&s;ervation of many per&s;ons, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their medical abilities, that the multiplying di&s;ea&s;es, natu|rally the &s;ame, or only &s;ymptoms of or acce&s;&s;ary to others, and the various appellations by which they have been di&s;tingui&s;hed, has at all times been an embarra&s;&s;|ment both to the &s;tudy and practice of phy&s;ic, and has ob&s;tructed its improvement; as the tremendous cata|logue of di&s;tempers, be&s;ides the load it charges on the memory, is a di&s;couragemant to many, and mu&s;t finally be productive of perplexity and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Further, all the world knows, that one identical mor|bific cau&s;e&punc; according to its different force, its different &s;eat, the difference of con&s;titution, climate, &s;ea&s;on and weather, produces &s;ymptoms, which though they may differ widely in their external appearances, and e&s;pecially in the degree of violence, yet the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e is the &s;ame, as being the effect of one and the &s;ame prox|imate cau&s;e; and therefore requires <HI>the like method of cure.</HI></P>
<P>It has been the opinion of &s;ome, that the <HI>ardent pu|trid fever,</HI> belonged to the cla&s;s of inflammatory di&s;|orders, though Hippocrates, by whom, it is termed the <HI>kau&s;es,</HI> i. e. <HI>febris ardens</HI> or <HI>burning fever,</HI> places it among the &s;ummer di&s;ea&s;es; and never among tho&s;e of the winter and &s;pring.</P>

<P>The mode of treatment by the above author in other re&s;pects is nearly the &s;ame as that recommended by Dr. Ti&s;&s;ott.</P>
<P>Dr. LIND ob&s;erves that "Intermitting and remitting fevers prevailed in their utmo&s;t violence in the year 1765, not only in Hamp&s;hire, but in many other parts of England, which &s;eemed to have been increa&s;ed that year by the unu&s;ual and exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;ummer; together with an undiluted putrid moi&s;ture in the &s;oil, and the long duration of ea&s;terly winds.

<P>He ob&s;erves, "that at Middleburgh, the capital of We&s;t Zealand, where his father and him&s;elf had prac|ti&s;ed twenty-eight years, a &s;ickne&s;s generally reigns to|wards the latter end of Augu&s;t, or the beginning of September, which is always mo&s;t violent after hot &s;ummers.</P>
<P>"It makes its appearance after the rains, which generally fall in the latter end of July; the &s;ooner it begins, the longer it continues, being checked only by the coldne&s;s of the weather.</P>
<P>"Towards the end of Augu&s;t, and the beginning of September, it is a continual burning fever, attended with a vomiting of bile, which is called the gall-&s;ick|ne&s;s. This fever, after continuing three or four days, intermits, a&s;&s;umes the form of a double tertian, and leaves the patient in a fortnight, or perhaps &s;ooner; &s;trangers, who have been accu&s;tomed to breathe a dry pure air, do not recover &s;o quickly.</P>
<P>"Foreigners, in indigent circum&s;tances, &s;uch as the Scotch and German &s;oldiers, who are garri&s;oned in the adjacent places, are apt, after tho&s;e fevers, to have a &s;welling in their legs, and a drop&s;y; of which many die.</P>
<P>"Fluxes are frequent in September and October; towards the latter end of which indeed the air becomes more healthy, and then few di&s;ea&s;es prevail. At this time, tho&s;e who have laboured under the fever &s;ome|times &s;uffer a relap&s;e; but then it is into a &s;imple ter|tian, which &s;eldom confines the patient."</P>
<P>The Doctor farther ob&s;erves, "That tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are the &s;ame with the double tertian fevers, common between the tropics. Such," &s;ays he, "as are &s;eized with the gall-&s;ickne&s;s, have, at fir&s;t, &s;ome flu&s;hes of heat over the body, a lo&s;s of appetite, a white foul tongue, a yellow tinge in the eyes, and a pale colour in the

lips. An emetic admini&s;tered before the gall-di&s;ea&s;e appears, is &s;erviceable. Bleeding is &s;eldom requi&s;ite, unle&s;s in per&s;ons of a plethoric habit. The gall-&s;ickne&s;s is removed chiefly by cooling medicines; but, in Octo|ber, the tertian agues cannot be cured without the bark.</P>

<P>"The mo&s;t frequent and fatal di&s;ea&s;es in the &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on in Guinea are not of an inflammatory nature. Indeed &s;o much harm has been done there by the lan|cet, in the hands of &s;uch as have read only Sydenham's works, or authors who treat of inflammatory fevers on|ly, that it is mo&s;t advi&s;eable for the inexperienced in &s;uch climates to ab&s;tain altogether from its u&s;e, and to tru&s;t the &s;afety of their patients, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to vomits and the early application of bli&s;ters, together with the u&s;e of tartarum emeticum, in &s;mall do&s;es, or of antimo|nial medicines of gentle operation, during the fever, and of the bark upon its fir&s;t remi&s;&s;ion; whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> will be found the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful and judicious method of treat|ing tho&s;e fevers.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of a &s;mall quantity of blood, in the begin|ning of a fever, does often neither good nor hurt; and there are di&s;ea&s;es incident to Europeans in that part of the world, e&s;pecially in the dry &s;ea&s;on, which may re|quire even a repetition of that operation. But during the rainy or &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, in the ca&s;e of Europeans la|bouring under the fever, it is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary to take away blood; and large and repeated bleedings are at|tended with fatal con&s;equences. Nothing can be a plainer proof of the di&s;po&s;ition of the air in this coun|try, to produce remitting and intermitting fevers, than the common ob&s;ervation that tho&s;e who have had ob&s;ti|nate agues in England or Holland, almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;uffer a relap&s;e when they come on this coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Bengal, next to Bencoolen, of all the Engli&s;h facto|ries, proves the mo&s;t fatal to Europeans. The rainy &s;ea&s;on commences at Bengal in June, and continues till October: the remainder of the year is healthy and plea|&s;ant.

During the rains, this rich and fertile country is almo&s;t quite covered by the overflowing of the river Ganges, and converted as it were into a large pool of water. Di&s;ea&s;es rage among the Europeans in the months of July, Augu&s;t, September, and October, at|tacking chiefly &s;uch as are lately arrived. Here, as in all other places, &s;ickne&s;s is more frequent and fatal in &s;ome years than others. The di&s;tempers are fevers of the remitting or intermitting kind; &s;ometimes they may begin under a continued form, and remain &s;everal days without any perceptible remi&s;&s;ion, but they have in general a great tendency to a remi&s;&s;ion. They are commonly accompanied with violent fits of rigors or &s;hiverings, and with di&s;charges of bile upwards and downwards. If the &s;ea&s;on be very &s;ickly, &s;ome are &s;eized with a malignant fever, of which they &s;oon die: the body is covered with blotches of a livid colour, and the corp&s;e in a few hours turns quite black and corrupted. At this time fluxes prevail, which may be called bilious or putrid, the better to di&s;tingui&s;h them from others which are accompanied with an inflamma|tion of the bowels. In all tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es at Bengal, the lancet is cautiou&s;ly to be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have been favoured, &s;ays Dr. Lind, with the fol|lowing ingenious ob&s;ervations by Dr. Bogue of Titch|field.</P>
<P>'The di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t fatal at Calcutta, while I was there, in 1757, began with the rainy &s;ea&s;on, and were ob&s;tinate putrid intermitting fevers. The cold fit, which was exce&s;&s;ively violent, continued often for twelve hours; and as the fever returned every day, the patients had not above four or five hours re&s;pite from it. During the rains, and for &s;ome time after, we had &s;ick, at the &s;ame time, in this place, one half of the men in the &s;quadron under the command of the ad|mirals Wat&s;on and Pococke. Out of three &s;hips of the line, and a 20 gun &s;hip, and tho&s;e not fully manned, we lo&s;t in &s;ix months upwards of 200 men, mo&s;t of whom died of the&s;e fevers.</P>
<P>'Camphire was found the be&s;t medicine in the fit. Bark and other anti&s;eptics were admini&s;tered in large

quantities, after fir&s;t giving an emetic, and emptying the bowels. This fever reduced the patients in general to &s;uch a weak &s;tate, that Mr. Ives, then &s;urgeon of that ho&s;pital, judged it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to give arrack in their boiled rice to tho&s;e who were on the recovery, or who had not the di&s;order in a violent degree. He likewi&s;e generou&s;ly &s;upplied them with Madeira wine.</P>
<P>'In the inflammatory fevers preceding the rainy &s;ea|&s;on, bleeding with caution was found of &s;ervice; but as &s;oon as the rainy &s;ea&s;on &s;et in, the lancet was &s;eldom or never u&s;ed.</P>

In bilious fluxes, when the common remedies failed, it was u&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s, either by unction or internally, ob&s;tructions in &s;ome of the vi&s;cera being then &s;uppo&s;ed to be the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Fluxes of long &s;tanding were &s;eldom cured without it. In all bilious complaints, emetics were not &s;o frequently given as formerly, being only intended to clean&s;e the &s;tomach, but the greate&s;t dependence was placed on mercurials, and purges given at a few days intermi&s;&s;ion, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the mo&s;t natural method of carrying off the bile.</P>
<P>'At Senegal, in the rivers Gambia and St. Domingo, on the Coa&s;t of Guinea, at Carpenter's River, near the Mu&s;quitoe Shore, in the We&s;t-Indies, and in many other places, I have been told, that almo&s;t all the European &s;trangers, at their fir&s;t coming, lo&s;e their appetite and colour, becoming yellow, and troubled with &s;ickne&s;s or indige&s;tion; and that gentle vomits are found &s;uitable to the di&s;ea&s;es in tho&s;e climates.</P>

<HEAD>"REMARKS ON THE CURE.</HEAD>
<P>"To expect &s;ucce&s;s in treating the&s;e fevers, it ap|pears to me nece&s;&s;ary to pay particular regard to their different degrees of violence. For example, the bilious fever, in the north of Germany, is much le&s;s violent than the &s;ame fever is in Minorca; and this again, than tho&s;e frequent in Africa, or the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>"For the cure of the bilious fever mo&s;t frequent while at &s;ea, bleeding in the beginning, e&s;pecially in athletic con&s;titutions, was generally nece&s;&s;ary; after which and the u&s;e of antimonial medicines and &s;aline mixtures, the fever &s;oon came to intermit; and then the Cort. Peru. being admini&s;tered, a few days com|pleted the cure.</P>
<P>"But when the &s;hips are in the ports of the Ea&s;t Indies, even though the fever runs high, blood-letting is &s;o far from being advi&s;eable, that I believe it is hurtful. Of the patients violently attacked with this fever at Joanna, I bled only two, one of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied the day following, the other e&s;caped by &s;oon after taking the bark. Mr. Bruce al&s;o bled two of his pa|tients after leaving Mohila, one expired &s;oon after, the other recovered.</P>
<P>"Dr. James Lind in his Treati&s;e on the Remitting Fever of Bengal in 1762, ob&s;erves, that by taking away only a few ounces of blood in the remi&s;&s;ion, there followed &s;uch a pro&s;tration of &s;trength, that they &s;unk under the violence of the next paroxi&s;m.</P>
<P>"During the rage of the Joanna fever, I began the cure with evacuants, &amp;c. in expectation of procuring a plain remi&s;&s;ion or intermi&s;&s;ion; but I found my&s;elf much di&s;appointed; for it a&s;&s;umed the appearance of a con|tinual fever, with now and then violent exacerbations, under which &s;everal &s;unk. Fearing this might be the fate of the greate&s;t part of the remaining &s;ick, I without farther delay, gave between 30 and 40 patients in the different &s;tages of the fever, Pulv. Cort. Peru. &dram;i. in wine or wine and water every hour. Several with &s;unk

pul&s;e, and apparently within a few hours of their end, were relieved in a few hours after taking a few do&s;es of the bark, and by continuing it for a day or two, recovered.</P>
<P>Dr. RUSH, in a paper read before the London Me|dical Society, Augu&s;t 8th, 1774, publi&s;hed in their 5th vol. at page 32, mentions, that of fifty or &s;ixty patients which he had attended in bilious fevers, the two preceding &s;ummers and autumns in Philadelphia, he had the misfortune of lo&s;ing but one, though he had con&s;tantly refu&s;ed to comply with the &s;olicitations of his patients with re&s;pect to <HI>bleeding.</HI> After emptying the &s;tomach and bowels by emetic tartar and catha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ic &s;alts, it was his practice to watch the fever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ly as po&s;&s;ible, and without waiting, as &s;ome have directed, till nature has thrown off &s;omething oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;y&s;tem, by a cri&s;is of &s;ome kind, he threw in the bark as &s;oon as he perceived the <HI>lea&s;t &s;hadow</HI> of a remi&s;|&s;ion. The&s;e remi&s;&s;ions generally continued four hours, in &s;ome longer, in others not quite &s;o long, and oc|curred for the mo&s;t part once in twenty-four hours.&mdash; "I mu&s;t here add (&s;ays Dr. Ru&s;h) that I attribute my &s;ucce&s;s in treating this fever to my giving the bark in &s;ub&s;tance, and in very large do&s;es: If it ever fails of breaking the fever, it is owing to its being given in too &s;mall a quantity." He acknowledges his obligations to Dr. Archibald, of the i&s;land of Nevis, for the free|dom with which he u&s;ed the bark, who had often given &ounce;&s;s. of bark every half hour, for a whole day or night together in the We&s;t-Indies, and that it would &s;tay upon the &s;tomach when no other medicine could be kept there.</P>
<P>Dr. Ru&s;h has al&s;o publi&s;hed an account of the bilious remitting fever, which was epidemic in Philadelphia in the year 1780, of which the following is an ab&s;tract.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="033590_0153_0FF7952B2230C6F0">"THE &s;pring of 1780 was dry and cool.</P>
<P>July and Augu&s;t were uncommonly warm. The mercury &s;tood on the 6th of Augu&s;t at 94&frac12;&deg;, on the 15th of the &s;ame month at 95&deg;, and for &s;everal days afterwards at 90&deg;.</P>
<P>The winds during the&s;e months blew chiefly from the &s;outh, and &s;outh-we&s;t. Of cour&s;e they pa&s;&s;ed over the land which lies between the city, and the conflux of the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill, the peculiar &s;itua|tion of which, at that time, has been already de&s;cribed.</P>

<P>The remitting fever made its fir&s;t appearance in July and Augu&s;t, but its &s;ymptoms were &s;o mild, and its extent &s;o confined, that it excited no apprehen&s;ions of its &s;ub&s;equent more general prevalence throughout the city.</P>
<P>On the 19th. of Augu&s;t the air became &s;uddenly very cool. Many hundred people in the city complained, the next day, of different degrees of indi&s;po&s;ition, from a &s;en&s;e of la&s;&s;itude, to a fever of the remitting type. This was the &s;ignal of the epidemic. The weather continued cool during the remaining part of the month, and during the whole month of September. From the expo&s;ure of the di&s;trict of Southwark (which is often di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the <HI>Hill</HI>) to the &s;outh-we&s;t winds, the fever made its fir&s;t appearance in that appendage of the city. Scarcely a family, and in many families, &s;carcely a member of them, e&s;caped it. From the Hill it gra|dually travelled along the &s;econd-&s;treet from the Dela|ware, improperly called Front-&s;treet. For a while it was confined to this &s;treet only, after it entered the city,
<PB N="151" REF="033590_0154_0FF7952D942643A0">
and hence it was called by &s;ome people the <HI>Front-&s;treet Fever.</HI> It gradually &s;pread through other parts of the city, but with very different degrees of violence. It prevailed but little in the Northern Liberties. It was &s;carcely known beyond fourth-&s;treet from the Delaware. Intemperance in eating or drinking, riding in the &s;un or rain, watching, fatigue, or even a fright, but more fre|quently cold, all &s;erved to excite the feeds of this fever into action, wherever they exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>All ages, and both &s;exes were affected by this fever. Seven of the practitioners of phy&s;ic were confined by it nearly at the &s;ame time. The city, during the preva|lence of the fever, was filled with an unu&s;ual number of &s;trangers, many of whom, particularly of the Friends (who&s;e yearly meeting was held in the month of Sep|tember) were affected by it.</P>
<P>This fever generally came on with rigor, but &s;eldom with a regular chilly fit, and often without any &s;en&s;ation of cold. In &s;ome per&s;ons it was introduced by a &s;light &s;ore throat, and in others, by a hoar&s;ene&s;s which was mi&s;taken for a common cold. A giddine&s;s in the head was the forerunner of the di&s;ea&s;e in &s;ome people. This giddine&s;s attacked &s;o &s;uddenly, as to produce, in &s;everal in&s;tances, a faintne&s;s, and even &s;ymptoms of apoplexy. It was remarkable that all tho&s;e per&s;ons who were af|fected in this violent manner, recovered in two or three days.</P>
<P>I met with one in&s;tance of this fever attacking with coma, and another with convul&s;ions, and with many in|&s;tances in which it was introduced by a delirium.</P>
<P>The pains which accompanied this fever were exqui|&s;itely &s;evere in the head, back, and limbs. The pains in the head were &s;ometimes in the back parts of it, and at other times they occupied only the eyeballs. In &s;ome people, the pains were &s;o acute in their backs and hips, that they could not lie in bed. In others, the pains af|fected the neck and arms, &s;o as to produce in one in|&s;tance a difficulty of moving the fingers of the right hand. They all complained more or le&s;s of a &s;orene&s;s in the &s;eats of the&s;e pains, particularly when they occu|pied the head and eyeballs. A few complained of their

fle&s;h being &s;ore to the touch, in every part of the body. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;ometimes believed to be a rheumati&s;m. But its more general name among all cla&s;&s;es of people was, the <HI>Break-bone Fever.</HI></P>
<P>I met with one ca&s;e of pain in the back, and another of an acute ear-ach, both of which returned periodically every night, and without any fever.</P>
<P>A nau&s;ea univer&s;ally, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, a vomit|ing, accompanied by a di&s;agreeable talle in the mouth, attended this fever. The bowels were, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, regular, except where the di&s;ea&s;e fell with its whole force upon them, producing a &s;ymptomatic dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>The tongue was generally moi&s;t, and tinctured of a yellow color.</P>
<P>The urine was high colored, and in its u&s;ual quanti|ty in fevers.</P>
<P>The &s;kin was generally moi&s;t, e&s;pecially where the di&s;ea&s;e terminated on the third or fourth day.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e was quick and full, but never hard in a &s;in|gle patient that came under my care, till the 28th. of September.</P>
<P>It was remarkable, that little, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, no thir&s;t attended this fever.</P>
<P>A &s;creatus, or con&s;tant hawking and &s;pitting, attend|ed in many ca&s;es through the whole di&s;ea&s;e, and was a favourable &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>There were generally remi&s;&s;ions in this fever every morning, and &s;ometimes in the evening. The exacer+bations were more &s;evere every other day, and two exa|cerbations were often ob&s;erved in one day.</P>
<P>A ra&s;h often appeared on the third and fourth days, which proved favourable. This ra&s;h was accompanied in &s;ome ca&s;es by a burning in the palms of the hands and &s;oles of the feet. Many people at this time, who were not confined to their beds, and &s;ome, who had no fever, had an efflore&s;cence on their &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins.</P>
<P>In &s;everal per&s;ons the force of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eemed to fall upon the face, producing &s;welling under the jaw and in the cars, which in &s;ome in&s;tances terminated in ab&s;ce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="033590_0156_0FF79530CD7461B8">When the fever did not terminate on the third or fourth day, it frequently ran on to the eleventh, four|teenth, and even twentieth day, a&s;&s;uming in its pro|gre&s;s, according to its duration, the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of the typhus gravior, or mitior, of Doctor Cullen. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the di&s;charge of a few &s;poonfuls of blood from the no&s;e accompanied a &s;olution of the fever on the third or fourth day; while in others, a profu&s;e haemorrhage from the no&s;e, mouth, and bowels, on the tenth and eleventh days, preceded a fatal i&s;&s;ue of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Several ca&s;es came under my care, in which the fever was &s;ucceeded by a jaundice.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e terminated in &s;ome ca&s;es without &s;weat|ing, or a &s;ediment in the urine; nor did I find &s;uch patients more di&s;po&s;ed to relap&s;e than others, provided they took a <HI>&s;ufficient quantity of the bark.</HI></P>
<P>About the beginning of October the weather be|came cool, accompanied by rain and an ea&s;terly wind. This cool and wet weather continued for four days. The mercury in the thermometer fell to 60&deg;, and fires became agreeable. From this time the fever evidently declined, or was accompanied with inflammatory &s;ymp|toms. On the 16th of October, I met with a ca&s;e of inflammatory angina; and on the next day I vi|&s;ited a patient who had a complication of the bilious fever with a pleuri&s;y, and who&s;e blood di&s;covered &s;trong marks of the pre&s;ence of the inflammatory diathe&s;is. His &s;tools were of a green and black colour. On the third day of his di&s;order the ra&s;h appeared on his &s;kin, and on the fourth, in con&s;equence of a &s;econd bleeding, his fever terminated with the common &s;ymp|toms of a cri&s;is.</P>
<P>During the latter end of October, and the fir&s;t weeks in November, the mercury in the thermometer fluctu|ated between 50&deg; and 60&deg;. Pleuri&s;ies and inflamma|tory di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds now made their appearance. They were more numerous and more acute, than in this &s;tage of the autumn, in former years. I met with one ca&s;e of pleuri&s;y in November, which did not yield to le&s;s than <HI>four plentiful bleedings.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="033590_0157_0FF7953339A76E10">I &s;hall now add a &s;hort account of the METHOD I pur&s;ued in the treatment of this fever.</P>
<P>After evacuating the contents of the &s;tomach and bowels, I gave &s;mall do&s;es of tartar emetic mixed with Glauber's &s;alt. This medicine exited a general per|&s;piration. It likewi&s;e kept the bowels gently open, by which means the bile was di&s;charged as fa&s;t as it was accumulated.</P>
<P>On the third or fourth day, in the afternoon, the pains in the head and back generally abated, with a &s;weat which was diffu&s;ed over the whole body. The pul&s;e at this time remained quick and weak. This was, however, no objection <HI>to the u&s;e of the bark,</HI> a few do&s;es of which immediately <HI>abated its quickne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>prevented a return of the fever.</HI></P>
<P>If the fever continued beyond the third or fourth day without an intermi&s;&s;ion, I always had recour&s;e to bli&s;ters. Tho&s;e which were applied to the neck, and behind the ears, produced the mo&s;t immediate good effects. They &s;eldom failed of producing an intermi&s;|&s;ion in the fever, the day after they were applied. Where delirium or coma attended, I applied the bli&s;|ter to the neck on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> day of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>Where the fever did not yield to bli&s;ters, and a&s;&s;u|med the &s;ymptoms of typhus gravior or mitior, I gave the medicines u&s;ually exhibited in both the &s;pecies of that fever.</P>
<P>I took notice in the hi&s;tory of this fever that it was &s;ometimes accompanied by the &s;ymptoms of a dy&s;en|tery. Where this di&s;order appeared, I pre&s;cribed le|nient purges and opiates. Where the&s;e failed of &s;uc|ce&s;s, I gave the bark in the intermi&s;&s;ion of the pain in the bowels, and applied bli&s;ters to the wri&s;ts. The good effects of the&s;e remedies led me to conclude that the dy&s;entery was the febris introver&s;a of Doctor Sydenham.</P>
<P>I am happy in having an opportunity, in this place, of bearing a te&s;timony in favour of the u&s;efulne&s;s of OPIUM in this di&s;order, after the nece&s;&s;ary evacuations had been made. I yielded, in pre&s;cribing it at fir&s;t, to the earne&s;t &s;olicitations of my patients for &s;omething
<PB N="155" REF="033590_0158_0FF79535A7D2FDF8">
to give them relief from their in&s;upportable pains, par|ticularly when they were &s;eated in the eyeballs and head. Its &s;alutary effects in procuring &s;weat, and a remi&s;&s;ion of the fever, led me to pre&s;cribe it afterwards in almo&s;t every ca&s;e, and always with the happie&s;t ef|fects. Tho&s;e phy&s;icians enjoy but little plea&s;ure in practi&s;ing phy&s;ic, who know not how much of the pain and <HI>angui&s;h of fevers, of a certain kind,</HI> may be le&s;&s;ened by the judicious u&s;e of opium.</P>
<P>In treating of the remedies u&s;ed in this di&s;order, I have taken no notice of <HI>blood-letting.</HI> Out of &s;everal hundred patients whom I vi&s;ited in this fever, I did not meet with a &s;ingle ca&s;e, before the 27th of Sep|tember, in which the &s;tate of the pul&s;e indicated this evacuation. It is true, the pul&s;e was <HI>full,</HI> but never <HI>hard.</HI> I acknowledge that I was called to &s;everal pa|tients who had been bled without the advice of a phy|&s;ician, who recovered afterwards on the u&s;ual days of the &s;olution of the fever. This can only be a&s;cri|bed to that di&s;po&s;ition which Doctor Cleghorn atri|butes to fevers, to pre&s;erve their types under every variety of treatment, as well as con&s;titution. <HI>But I am bound to declare further, that I heard of &s;everal ca&s;es, in which bleeding was followed by a fatal termination of the di&s;ea&s;e</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the malignant yellow fever is only a higher grade of the fever ju&s;t de&s;cribed, how does it happen that the remedies which cured this, were, in the majority of ca&s;es, injurious, or at lea&s;t u&s;ele&s;s in that fever?

<P>"Philadelphia became unu&s;ually &s;ickly after the year 1778, during the late war, in con&s;equence of the mea|dows being overflowed to the &s;outhward of the city, and of the cutting down of the trees by the Briti&s;h army, which formerly &s;heltered the city from the ex|halations of the grounds to the north and north-we&s;t.

<P>SIR GEORGE BAKER, in a communication to the College of Phy&s;icians of London, publi&s;hed in the 3d vol. of their tran&s;actions, relates, that in ob&s;tinate in|termittents, which prevailed in London in the year 1782, he had ob&s;erved evident good effects from &s;mall do&s;es of calomel, taken two or three evenings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and then followed by a purgative of mo|derate &s;trength. He al&s;o mentions the ca&s;e of a &s;iph|litic patient with a quartan ague, who had not a &s;ingle return of the fever after the commencement of the &s;a|livation.</P>
<P>It appears from a quotation in the &s;ame commu|nication, that Dr. Willis, cotemporary of Syden|ham, had propo&s;ed to cure a young lady by inducing a gentle &s;alivation, to which &s;he con&s;ented; and that the fever cea&s;ed as &s;oon as he had affected a &s;alivation, which he was twelve days in accompli&s;hing.</P>
<P>It appears from hi&s;torical facts, collected by Sir George Baker, that the Peruvian bark, which Syden|ham claims the credit of introducing into practice in London, belonged to an apothecary of the name of Talbor, who&s;e cures were &s;o remarkable and &s;urpri|&s;ing by its u&s;e, that he was knighted by King Charles the II. Harvey, Li&s;ter, Hodges and Morton were all cotemporaries of Sydenham.</P>
<P>The &s;ame author &s;ays, that a medicine compo&s;ed of ar&s;enic and opium, (the do&s;e of which was a very few drops in water) was taken by &s;ome people, and &s;ome|times &s;ucce&s;sfully; but that now and then violent vo|mitings, colic, and dy&s;entery were the effects of it. He had al&s;o received information of an ague thus
<PB N="157" REF="033590_0160_0FF7953ACDDB8410">
cured, which was followed by a pal&s;ey of the lower limbs: and concludes, that it cannot be deemed to be a proper remedy for an intermittent fever, whil&s;t an intermittent fever is le&s;s formidable than ar&s;enic.</P>
<P>Dr. CULLEN, in the fir&s;t lines of his Practice of Phy&s;ic, publi&s;hed in the year 1784, remarks, that, "The paroxi&s;ms of pure intermittent fevers are al|ways fini&s;hed in le&s;s than twenty four hours: and though it happens that there are fevers which con&s;i&s;t of repeated paroxi&s;ms, without any entire intermi&s;&s;ion be|tween them; yet in &s;ome ca&s;es it is ob&s;erved, that, though the hot and &s;weating &s;tages of the paroxi&s;m do not entirely cea&s;e before the twenty-four hours from their beginning have expired, they &s;uffer however be|fore that time, a con&s;iderable abatement or <HI>remi&s;&s;ion</HI> of their violence; and at the return of the quotidian period, a paroxi&s;m is in &s;ome &s;hape renewed, which runs the &s;ame cour&s;e as before. This con&s;titutes what is called a <HI>remittent fever.</HI></P>
<P>When in the&s;e remittents the remi&s;&s;ion is con&s;ider|able, and the return of a new paroxi&s;m is di&s;tinctly marked by the &s;ymptoms of a cold &s;tage at the begin|ning of it; &s;uch fevers retain &s;trictly the appellation of <HI>remittents.</HI> But when it happens, as it does in certain ca&s;es, that the remi&s;&s;ion is not con&s;iderable, is perhaps without &s;weat, and that the returning paroxi&s;m is not marked by the mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of a cold &s;tage, but chiefly by the aggravation or <HI>exacerbation</HI> of a hot &s;tage, the di&s;ea&s;e is called a <HI>continued fever.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es of continued fever, the remi&s;&s;ions and exacerbations are &s;o incon&s;iderable as not to be ea&s;ily ob&s;erved or di&s;tingui&s;hed; and this has led phy&s;icians to imagine, that there is a &s;pecies of fever &s;ub&s;i&s;ting for &s;everal days together, and &s;eemingly con&s;i&s;ting of one paroxi&s;m only. This they have called a <HI>continent fever;</HI> but, in a long cour&s;e of practice, I have not had an opportunity of ob&s;erving &s;uch a fever.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="033590_0161_0FF7953C70056948">It is, however, to be ob&s;erved here, that the fevers of a continued form are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another; and that, while &s;ome of a very continued form do &s;till belong to the &s;ection of intermittents, there are others which, though &s;till con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eparate and re|peated paroxi&s;ms, yet, as different by their cau&s;es and circum&s;tances from intermittents, are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the whole of the&s;e, and are more &s;trictly to be called and con&s;idered as <HI>continued.</HI> Such are mo&s;t of tho&s;e which have been commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>conti|nent;</HI> and tho&s;e which by mo&s;t writers have been &s;imply named <HI>continued;</HI> and which term I have employed as the title of a &s;ection, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of <HI>intermittent.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall here add the marks by which, in practice, the&s;e different continued fevers may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e fevers of a continued form, which, however, &s;till belong to the &s;ection of intermittents, may be di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their having pa&s;&s;ed from an intermittent or remittent form, to that of a continued; by their &s;hewing &s;ome tendency to become intermittent, or at lea&s;t remittent; by their being known to have been oc|ca&s;ioned by mar&s;h mia&s;mata; and, for the mo&s;t part, by their having but one paroxi&s;m, or one exacerbation or remi&s;&s;ion, in the cour&s;e of twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>On the other hand, continued fevers, to be more &s;trictly &s;o called, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by their &s;hewing little tendency to become intermittent or remittent in any part of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ur&s;e, and e&s;pecially after the fir&s;t week of their continuance, by their being occa&s;ioned by human contagion, at lea&s;t by other cau&s;es than the mar&s;h mia&s;mata; and by their having pretty con&s;tantly an exacerbation and <HI>remi&s;&s;ion twice in the cour&s;e of every twenty-four hours.</HI> In both ca&s;es, the knowledge of the nature of the epidemic for the time prevailing, may have a great &s;hare in determining the nature of the particular fever.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the form, or <HI>type,</HI> of fevers, this fur|ther may be ob&s;erved, that the quartan, while it has the longe&s;t interval, has, at the &s;ame time, the longe&s;t and
<PB N="159" REF="033590_0162_0FF7953EE6152928">

<P>The type of fevers is &s;ometimes changed in their cour&s;e. When this happens, it is generally in the fol|lowing manner: Both tertians and quartans change in|to quotidians, quotidians into remittents, and the&s;e la&s;t become often of the mo&s;t continued kind. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, the fever has its paroxi&s;ms protracted longer than u&s;ual, before it changes into a type of more frequent repetition.</P>
<P>It has been rendered probable, that the remote cau&s;es of fevers are chiefly contagions or mia&s;mata, and nei|ther of them of great variety. We have &s;uppo&s;ed that mia&s;mata are the cau&s;e of intermittents, and contagions the cau&s;e of continued fevers, &s;trictly &s;o named; but we cannot with propriety employ the&s;e general terms. For, as the cau&s;e of continued fevers may ari&s;e from fomites, and may, in &s;uch ca&s;es, be called a mia&s;ma; and as other mia&s;mata al&s;o may produce contagious di&s;ea&s;es; it will be proper to di&s;tingui&s;h the cau&s;es of fevers, by u&s;ing the terms <HI>human</HI> or <HI>mar&s;h effluvia,</HI> rather than the general ones of contagion, or mia&s;ma.</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident, than that blood-letting is one of the mo&s;t powerful means of dimini&s;hing the ac|tivity of the whole body, e&s;pecially of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem; and it mu&s;t therefore be the mo&s;t effectual means of moderating the violence of reaction in fevers. Taking this as a fact, I omit inquiring into its mode of operation, and &s;hall only con&s;ider in what circum&s;tan|ces of fevers it may be mo&s;t properly employed.</P>
<P>When the violence of reaction, and its con&s;tant atten|dant, a pillogi&s;tic diathe&s;is, are &s;ufficiently manife&s;t; when the&s;e con&s;titute the principal part of the di&s;ea&s;e, and may be expected to continue throughout the whole of it, as in the ca&s;es of <HI>&s;ynocha;</HI> then blood-letting is the principal remedy, and may be employed as far as the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e may &s;eem to require, and

the con&s;titution of the patient will bear. It is, how|ever, to be attended to, that a greater evacuation than is nece&s;&s;ary, may occa&s;ion a flower recovery, may render the per&s;on more liable to a relap&s;e, or may bring on other di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of <HI>&s;ynocha,</HI> therefore, there is little doubt about the propriety of blood-letting: But there are other &s;pecies of fever, as the <HI>&s;ynochus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> <HI>in which a violent reaction and phlogi&s;tic diathe&s;is appear, and prevail during &s;ome part of the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e;</HI> while, at the &s;ame time, the&s;e circum&s;tances do not con&s;titute the principal part of the di&s;ea&s;e, nor are to be expected to continue during the whole cour&s;e of it; and, it is well known, that, <HI>in many ca&s;es, the &s;tate of violent reaction is to be &s;ucceeded, &s;ooner or later, by a &s;tate of debility, from the exce&s;s of which the danger of the di&s;ea&s;e is chiefly to ari&s;e. It is, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary that, in many ca&s;es, blood-letting &s;hould be avoided; and even al|though, during the inflammatory &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, it may be proper, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take care that the evac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ation be not &s;o large as to increa&s;e the &s;tate of the debility which is to follow.</HI></P>
<P>From all this it mu&s;t appear, that the employing blood-letting, in certain fevers, requires much di&s;cern|ment and &s;kill, and is to be governed by the con&s;ide|ration of the following circum&s;tances:</P>
<P N="1">1. The nature of the prevailing epidemic.</P>
<P N="2">2. The nature of the remote cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;ea&s;on and climate in which the di&s;ea&s;e occurs.</P>

<P N="5">5. The period of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. The age, vigour, and plethoric &s;tate of the pa|tient.</P>
<P N="7">7. The patient's former di&s;ea&s;es and habits of blood-letting.</P>

<P><PB N="161" REF="033590_0164_0FF795431B4F2660">When, after the con&s;ideration of the&s;e circum&s;tances, blood-letting is determined to be nece&s;&s;ary, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that it is more effectual, according as the blood is more &s;uddenly drawn off, and as the body is, at the &s;ame time, more free from all irritation, and, con&s;equently, when in a po&s;ture in which the fewe&s;t mu&s;cles are in action.</P>
<P>Another evacuation whereby the quantity of fluids contained in the body can be con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, is that of purging.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, this evacuation may induce a con|&s;iderable degree of debility; &s;o, in tho&s;e ca&s;es in which a dangerous &s;tate of debility is likely to occur, purging is to be employed with a great deal of caution; and more e&s;pecially as the due mea&s;ure of the evacuation is more difficult to be applied than in the ca&s;e of blood-letting."</P>
<P>Dr. BLANE, in his ob&s;ervations on the Di&s;ea&s;es of Seamen, publi&s;hed in the year 1785, remarks, that, "Bilious remitting fevers ari&s;e in the &s;ame &s;ituations in hot climates, in which intermittents ari&s;e in tem|perate ones.</P>
<P>Seldom ari&s;e at &s;ea, unle&s;s where there has been previous expo&s;ure on &s;hore&mdash;In tho&s;e ca&s;es, the per&s;ons that have been expo&s;ed to the noxious air of mar&s;hes or woods, are generally affected &s;even or eight days after &s;uch expo&s;ure.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ymptom</HI> is a copious <HI>&s;ecretion of bile,</HI> which attends it. The &s;ymptoms are peculiarly violent (to Europeans) at the beginning. This fever, when it ari&s;es merely from the effluvia of woods and mar&s;hes, has a natural tendency to remit. But in many of tho&s;e that aro&s;e at Jamaica, little or no remi&s;&s;ion was to be perceived. It was di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;hip fever by the bilious vomiting and &s;tools, more violent delirium and head-ach, and by being attended with le&s;s debility. The&s;e men had been expo&s;ed to &s;uch cau&s;es as u&s;ually produce continued fevers, &s;uch as

infection, the foul air of the French prizes, intempe|rance and hard labour. Some of them were affected with yellowne&s;s of the eyes and of the whole &s;kin, but without the other &s;ymptoms that characteri&s;e the yellow fever, properly &s;o called.</P>
<P>In this fever venae&s;ection was generally beneficial at the beginning, &amp;c. A remi&s;&s;ion was then procured by emetics, &s;aline purges, and an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nl. preparations, with neutral &s;alts, &amp;c. p. 92.</P>
<P>When from a fre&s;h accumulation of bile the fever appears to be kept up, a repetition of evacuants is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and <HI>calomel</HI> will be found to an&s;wer remarkably well as a purgative, its &s;timulus being &s;o exten&s;ive as to loo&s;en and bring away bile, when the &s;aline purga|tives have failed of having that effect: And it will be &s;till more effectual for this purpo&s;e, if given alone in a do&s;e, from five to ten grs. and followed &s;ome hours afterwards by &s;ome other purgative.</P>
<P>If the fever &s;hould not yield during the fir&s;t week, but takes an unfavourable turn, the pul&s;e then becomes more &s;mall and frequent, there is a general agitation, the tongue is tremulous when put out, great thir&s;t, dry &s;kin and delirium.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances, be&s;ides the continuation of antimonials in &s;mall do&s;es, with diaphoretic anodines, and the occa&s;ional u&s;e of purgatives, bli&s;ters now be|come proper.

<P>Dr. B. MOSELEY, in his treati&s;e on tropical di&s;ea&s;es, 3d edition publi&s;hed in the year 1792, remarks, that "At the &s;etting in of autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, intermittents are always attended with a greater &s;ecretion of bile, than they are afterwards, when the &s;ea&s;on has farther advanced. And the earlier the autumnal &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on commences, the more the liver is affected, and the
<PB N="163" REF="033590_0166_0FF795476204FFE8">
greater is the quantity of bile attending them. For which rea&s;on, bark at that time is improper, when given without perfect intermi&s;&s;ions. A patient can take much more bark, without injur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in a December inter|mittent, than he can in an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugu&s;t one. Yellowne&s;s in the eyes, ten&s;ion of the abdomen, and a cough, are generally produced by a few do&s;es of bark, in the be|ginning of autumn; and this is an infallible &s;ign, that the body is not properly prepared for it. But when the autumnal intermittants do not &s;et in until Novem|ber, bark, in general, may be taken with &s;afety, with|out much previous preparation, becau&s;e they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l|dom attended with tho&s;e exce&s;&s;ive bilious &s;ecretions, and that febrile di&s;po&s;ition, which accompany them in the earlier months.</P>
<P>Spring di&s;ea&s;es, in hot climates, though not always &s;trongly marked, have in general an inflammatory ten|dency; which tendency gradually declines with the &s;ea&s;on, and di&s;appears in autumn.</P>
<P>The autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, in Jamaica, in the year 1776, &s;et in, in November; the &s;ea&s;on was cold and rainy. Fevers came on with a &s;hivering; but a good inter|mi&s;&s;ion generally &s;ucceeded the fir&s;t paroxi&s;m; in which, if eight or ten drahms of bark were given, all went on well: if not, the fever returned the next even|ing, and the following day only a remi&s;&s;ion &s;ucceeded &mdash;bark then would not an&s;wer. The third fit univer|&s;ally ended in a low continued fever, which required early bli&s;ters, cordials, and &s;timulants, as the patients all &s;unk very much, and many died.</P>
<P>The type of di&s;ea&s;es is very often di&s;&s;imilar, in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, in a di&s;trict only of a few miles. In hot, mar&s;hy, low &s;ituations, autumnal intermittents have generally a putrid tendency; and &s;ometimes after a few paroxi&s;ms degenerate into irregular, low, fevers, ac|companied with colliquative &s;weats, and diarrhoeas. Here the early u&s;e of bark, in every climate, is proper; and the almo&s;t indi&s;criminate adimini&s;tration of it, &s;el|dom attended with danger.</P>
<P>This locality of di&s;ea&s;e ought to be well con&s;idered, by tho&s;e who write for the information of others; and
<PB N="164" REF="033590_0167_0FF7954AB6E1A308">
&s;hould not be confounded with the endemics of a country, or of a climate at large: for &s;uch varieties occur in every part of the world.</P>
<P>On examining the &s;ituation of <HI>Modena,</HI> in Italy, I found many local circum&s;tances combined to make it probable that TORTI's exten&s;ive admini&s;tration of bark, had better rea&s;ons to &s;upport it than his theory; or than his adver&s;aries admitted. However, TORTI adopted the important di&s;tinction, between a <HI>corruptive,</HI> and a <HI>depurative</HI> intermittent; which is a di&s;tinction, I wi&s;h to inculcate between the tropics. In the former, which chiefly belongs to the autumnal &s;ea&s;on, TORTI's doc|trine may &s;ometimes apply; and "ab ip&s;o exordio per corticem &s;uppremi poterit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Therapeutices Specialis, Lib. I. cap. viii. p. 60. Ed. Ve|netiis, 1769.</NOTE>;" but in the latter, if there be not an intermittent di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;ea&s;on, or &s;ome local putrid tendency, it will be found that bark is not always nece&s;&s;ary in the cure of intermittent fevers; and that frequently, by ob&s;tructing &s;ome de&s;ign of nature, does great mi&s;chief, and particularly when given too early.</P>
<P>The notions of a&s;thenia, and putridity, &s;o univer&s;ally prevailed in Jamaica, at the time of my arriving in the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;land, that the word <HI>inflammatory,</HI> as connected with fever, was &s;carcely known; and copious, or repeated bleeding, was in general con&s;idered as an agent of death.</P>
<P>There had been violent contentions formerly on the&s;e points, particularly as referring to the yellow fever: but no per&s;on had ever defined that fever with accu|racy, nor con&s;idered it as a genuine inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The two unfortunate phy&s;icians <HI>Williams</HI> and <HI>Bennet,</HI> at King&s;ton, who terminated their di&s;putes on this &s;ub|ject by killing each other in a duel on the 29th of December 1750, both, adopted the opinion that the yellow fever was a <HI>bilious fever,</HI> and gave it that appel|lation; and though <HI>Williams's</HI> intentions of cure were
<PB N="165" REF="033590_0168_0FF7954C63A1FA90">
rational, yet it did not appear that he was able to di&s;|tingui&s;h this di&s;ea&s;e from others which are <HI>really bili|ous,</HI> and peculiar to that part of the world.</P>
<P>This want of di&s;crimination had always exi&s;ted in the We&s;t-Indies; and the con&s;equence was, that cardiacs and refrigerants, evacuants and bark, emetics and bleeding, frequently, and fatally, u&s;urped the place of each other."</P>
<P>According to the ob&s;ervations of the accurate Dr. Jack&s;on, "the paroxi&s;ms of the fever of Jamaica are ob&s;erved in many in&s;tances, to terminate in more per|fect <HI>remi&s;&s;ions,</HI> than the paroxi&s;ms of the endemic of North America, which is known to be fundamentally an <HI>intermitting fever.</HI> Hence authors are generally of opinion, that all the difference which appears to take place in tho&s;e fevers, depends merely on accidental cau&s;es, viz. on the greater or le&s;s heat of the climate and moi&s;ture of the &s;oil</P>
<P>The common fever in that part of Jamaica called <HI>Savanna La Mar</HI> from the year 1774 to 1778, was not only di&s;po&s;ed to terminate of its own accord; but it was di&s;po&s;ed to terminate on certain critical days, often at an early period, and by &s;igns of cri&s;is too clear to be mi&s;taken; neither did the Peruvian bark, in the manner at lea&s;t, in which it was managed, ever cut &s;hort its cour&s;e with certainty. The endemic of America, on the contrary, often la&s;ted long. It frequently indeed, changed to another di&s;ea&s;e, after a length of time; but no period could be a&s;&s;igned for its natural termination, e&s;pecially in the northern &s;tates. Neither did the Peru|vian bark. though its effects were &s;o equivocal in the fevers of Jamaica, &s;carcely ever fail of &s;topping the pro|gre&s;s of the fever. To which we may add, that the complaint which, &s;trictly &s;peaking, is called the inter|mittent or ague and fever, can &s;carcely be &s;aid to belong to Jamaica; at lea&s;t it was not known at Savanna-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a-Mar.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="033590_0169_0FF7954ED7148DD8">The fever that chiefly prevailed at Savanna-La-Mar, was u&s;ually mild in its &s;ymptoms, and more regularly remitting in its form, than in mo&s;t other parts of the I&s;land. Savanna-La-Mar is &s;ituated clo&s;e by the &s;ea; its particular &s;cite, and the &s;urrounding country, to the di&s;tance of &s;everal miles, is perfectly level; whil&s;t in con&s;equence of its being open to the &s;ea on the ea&s;t, it is vi&s;ited early and con&s;tantly, by a &s;alutary and refre&s;h|ing breeze. It is however, almo&s;t &s;urrounded on the north by a mora&s;s, from whence it might be &s;u&s;pected to be unhealthy, but this is not the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ea at high water, particularly at &s;pring tides, overflows the &s;wampy ground, and in a great mea&s;ure, perhaps, prevents the u&s;ual noxious qualities of mar&s;h exhalations.</P>
<P>The prevailing fever in the &s;outhern &s;tates of America, often lo&s;es its di&s;tinctive marks of intermi&s;&s;ion, in the hot months of &s;ummer; whil&s;t it approaches in other re&s;pects, &s;o near the fever of Jamaica; as to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from it with difficulty.</P>
<P>This was particularly the ca&s;e at Ebenezer in Geor|gia, in the year 1779, during the months of June and July. A cold &s;it was &s;eldom ob&s;erved in this place; unle&s;s, perhaps, in the fir&s;t attack; lowne&s;s, languor, head-ach, pain of the back, and other di&s;agreeable feel|ings, remained even in the mo&s;t perfect remi&s;&s;ions. The di&s;ea&s;e was likewi&s;e much di&s;po&s;ed to terminate of its own accord, on critical days: Yet though the&s;e re&s;em|blances were very &s;triking, the fever of Ebenezer was perfectly under the controul of the Peruvian bark, which was not exactly the ca&s;e with tho&s;e of Jamaica. But the fevers of the various i&s;lands in the Aegean &s;ea, as de&s;cribed by Hippocrates, and of Minorca, by the accurate Cleghorn, bear the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to the endemic of Savanna-La-Mar.</P>
<P>The fevers of Italy, of different parts of the continent of A&s;ia, as de&s;cribed by various writers, as well as the endemic of North America, &s;eem to be degene|rated or rather imperfect intermittents, than the di&s;ea&s;e commonly under&s;tood by the appellation of remittent.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="033590_0170_0FF7955218C64518">The different time of day at which fevers of a differ|ent type u&s;ually commence, is a matter of no &s;mall cu|rio&s;ity. The &s;ingle tertian at Jamaica for in&s;tance, was con&s;tantly ob&s;erved to begin in the forenoon, u&s;ually between the hours of eight and eleven; while tho&s;e forms of di&s;ea&s;e that were evidently quotidian, or &s;till more continued, as con&s;tantly began in the evening ge|nerally from four to eight. This &s;eemed to be a fixed di&s;tinction, and it is an important one. (It is al&s;o re|peatedly mentioned as a fact, by Dr. George Fordyce, in his E&s;&s;ay on Simple Fever, publi&s;hed in the year 1794, that the paroxi&s;m of the continued fever always com|mences in the evening.)</P>
<P>This rule re&s;pecting the connection between the hour of inva&s;ion and the type of the fever, does not hold true in the different parts of the continent of America; for there the mo&s;t u&s;ual hour of the inva&s;ion of the &s;ingle tertian, was twelve at noon; though in &s;ome ca&s;es, the paroxi&s;m came on as early as ten in the morning, or as late as two in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Of the bilious vomiting, &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on by Ga|len as a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of the &s;ingle tertian, I can only &s;ay, that I con&s;tantly ob&s;erved &s;uch evacuations to be more frequent in the different forms of the tertian, than in tho&s;e that appeared to be quotidian, or that ap|proached nearer to a continued type."</P>
<P>"The general nature of the cau&s;e of fever, or the nature of its various modifications is a my&s;tery, which we do not as yet know. We only know, that when pre&s;ent in a certain &s;tate of vigour and activity, it de|ranges or di&s;turbs the actions and functions of the &s;y&s;tem; while we likewi&s;e know, that it does not al|ways di&s;turb every action or every function in the &s;ame degree. It has occurred too often to have e&s;caped the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;ervation, that where one part of the body &s;uffers particularly, the others are often re|lieved in proportion. We frequently in this manner ob&s;erve, that general fever is dimini&s;hed by the ap|pearance of local pain; or, on the contrary, increa&s;ed by its removal. It likewi&s;e often happens from the &s;ame principle, that where the &s;tomach and biliary

&s;y&s;tem &s;uffer much, there is le&s;s di&s;order in the other parts: and on the other hand, that where the&s;e &s;uf|ferings are removed or mitigated, the general fever runs higher, and often continues high, till the &s;ame, or other local affections, are again produced. Thus, though we are totally ignorant of the intimate nature of the cau&s;e of fever, we &s;till perceive very plainly, that it either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;omething in its own nature, or accidentally meets with &s;omething in the con&s;titu|tion of the individual, which determines it to affect the different parts of the body in an unqual degree. <HI>It u&s;ually exerts its greate&s;t force upon parts, which are pre|ternaturally weakened by the general influence of climate, &s;ea&s;on, &s;ituation, or other accidental cau&s;es.</HI> Hence bilious appearances are common in the hote&s;t months of hot climates, pneumonic affection in cold and dry weather, greater degrees of va&s;cular excitement among the tem|perate and more active races of men; while &s;ymptoms of nervous affection prevail among the luxurious and enfeebled. The above, with other &s;pecies of the in|crea&s;ed action of the cau&s;e of fever on a particular part of the body, depend wholly, perhaps, on circum&s;tan|ces of accident; yet it has &s;o happened, that tho&s;e ir|regular determinations hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unfortunately been con|&s;idered as the efforts, which nature employs to expel from the body a cau&s;e, which di&s;turbs the economy of health I &s;hall not, at pre&s;ent go &s;o far as to con|tend, that the&s;e determinations are not, in fact, in|tentions of nature; but &s;hall only beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t, if they actually are intentions, that it is mere chance which determines whether they are &s;alutary or fatal. It is a truth which nobody will deny, where the force of the di&s;ea&s;e is accidentally directed to an organ of excre|tion, or to a part of little importance to life, that the re&s;t of the body is often proportionably relieved, and even that a recovery of general heaith is &s;ometimes the con&s;equence; yet the contrary is the effect, where the functions of the part, upon which the force of the fever has been thus accidentally diverted, are of im|mediate importance to the action of living. The Gout, a di&s;ea&s;e, the cau&s;e of which bears no very re|mote
<PB N="169" REF="033590_0172_0FF79555625DD618">
analogy to the cau&s;e of fever, may be adduced as affording an illu&s;tration of this truth. The proxi|mate cau&s;e of gout, is equally hid from us as the proximate cau&s;e of fever. We know, however, that the one equally with the other, has a tendency to de|&s;troy life. We likewi&s;e know, that there is a power or principle in the con&s;titution, which to a certain degree re&s;i&s;ts de&s;truction. The nature of this power, however, is unknown. We are not only in the dark with regard to its nature; but we can only form con|jectures about the part where it principally re&s;ides.&mdash; We, however, clearly perceive its force and activity to be different in different parts of the body. We may next be allowed to remark, that where the cau&s;e of gout is in a certain &s;tate of modification, tumults, (which properly enough may be termed re-action,) ari&s;e in the &s;y&s;tem, and go on to continue till this cau&s;e or hurtful matter finds an outlet from the body, or a lodgment on one particular part. The outlets from the body are numerous: the parts on which the gout &s;eems principally to fix its &s;eat, are the extre|mities, where the power of re&s;i&s;tance is &s;malle&s;t.&mdash; The vital principle, however, becomes weaker as man advances in years; and the cau&s;e of the di&s;order &s;eems then frequently to find accommodations in parts, which are le&s;s remote from the &s;ources of life. This more e&s;pecially is the ca&s;e, where tone and vigour have been preternaturally weakened. Hence the &s;tomach, the bowels, &s;ometimes the brain, and even the heart it&s;elf &s;uffer from the immediate action of this di&s;ea&s;e, in the latter periods of life. But though no per&s;on per|haps will deny, that the cau&s;e of gout finds readie&s;t accommodation, (if I may &s;o apply the term) in tho&s;e parts of the body, where the vital powers are naturally weak, or have been accidentally weakened from va|rious cau&s;es; yet we may add, that it is likewi&s;e re|moved from the parts, on which it has been thus fixed, by &s;uch applications as excite their active powers; or, in other words, which call forth the local re-action of the &s;y&s;tem. We may al&s;o ob&s;erve, that tumults ari&s;e in the general &s;y&s;tem, in con&s;equence of this repre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="170" REF="033590_0173_0FF79557CD746988">
or repul&s;ion of the morbid cau&s;e from a particular part; and that they do not in general cea&s;e, till an outlet is opened, or accommodation found in &s;ome other parts of the body. The above appearances, oc|cur daily in the hi&s;tory of gout. They &s;eem to bear a &s;trong analogy to tho&s;e irregular determinations, which frequently take place in fevers, and their cau&s;e perhaps is the &s;ame. We do not perceive any other law by which they can be explained, than the natural or adventitious &s;tate of activity of the powers of life, which re&s;i&s;t de&s;truction with unequal force in the differ|ent parts of the &s;y&s;tem: &s;o that we &s;hall be obliged to conclude, that tho&s;e &s;ufferings, which have hitherto been &s;tyled the efforts of nature, are in reality more of the pa&s;&s;ive than of the active kind.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which I have now mentioned, combat the very exi&s;tence of the opinion, which has been commonly received with regard to the vis me|dicatrix naturae. I have hinted, that the extent and limits of that principle are narrow, and that the &s;a|lutary effects are accidental. I &s;hall next endeavour to &s;hew, that they cannot, without danger, be made the ba&s;is of the general plan of cure in febrile di&s;|ea&s;es. The ta&s;k is important, but the attempt may be thought pre&s;umptuous, as an opinion, contrary to that which I advance, has obtained almo&s;t the uni|ver&s;al con&s;ent of mankind. I have no de&s;ire of chang|ing names, or of making di&s;tinctions, where there is in fact no difference. I perfectly acquie&s;ce in retaining the word vis medicatrix naturae, provided it is limitted to a certain mode of re-action, or to a power in the con&s;titution of re&s;ii&s;ting de&s;truction unequally in its different parts, in con&s;equence of which, irregular de|terminations &s;ometimes prove &s;alutary by accident; yet I mu&s;t add, that if we mean to denote by this term a &s;y&s;tem of laws, which have the be&s;t directed tendency to remove from the body a cau&s;e which de|&s;troys health, and endangers life, the opinion has a very uncertain foundation. There are few per&s;ons &s;o igno|rant, or &s;o blindly devoted to the doctrines of <HI>autokratcia</HI> as not to own, that the u&s;ually reputed efforts of na|ture,
<PB N="171" REF="033590_0174_0FF7955A38F87CE8">
are often ill directed, &s;ometimes pernicious: in &s;hort, that they are obviou&s;ly the cau&s;es of death. The truth of this ob&s;ervation cannot be denied, and unfor|tunately it obliges the advocates of the vis medicatrix naturae, to grant the conclu&s;ion, that the laws of the principle are imperfect. The works of the author of nature, as far as our limited knowledge can trace them, are univer&s;ally without defect, if examined according to the plan on which they have been originally formed. If they appear otherwi&s;e, it becomes us to he&s;itate be|fore we decide. We may not have comprehended the fundamental principle of the de&s;ign; but we revolt from the idea, that the execution would be left im|perfect, had it been intended by the Author of our be|ing, that the mechani&s;m of the frame would be &s;uch, as &s;hould oppo&s;e and remove, in the mo&s;t effectual manner, the derangements of the morbid cau&s;e. De|fect and imperfection can have no place in the de&s;igns of the Almighty. Had it actually been the original de|&s;ign of our Creator, that the human body &s;hould be provided with a &s;y&s;tem of the be&s;t concerted laws for re&s;toring its health, when deranged by the numerous cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, as it is impious to &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e laws could be defective &s;o we may rea&s;onably con|clude, that the effects of fevers would not then have been fatal. We find however, that fevers, as well as other di&s;ea&s;es, are fatal to people of all ages and de|&s;criptions: and that nature's intention of cure, if they really are intentions, are often de&s;tructive to her&s;elf. I need &s;carcely remind the reader of examples of their pernicious tendency. Vomiting, &s;weating, increa&s;ed di&s;charges by &s;tool, &amp;c. are generally con&s;idered as the &s;alutary efforts of nature: but in&s;tances are numerous, where the exce&s;s of tho&s;e evacuations have obviou&s;ly proved the cau&s;es of death. In the &s;ame manner, ab|&s;ce&s;&s;es, which in the remote parts of the body, &s;ome|times attend, and even &s;ometimes perhaps influence the favourable termination of fevers; in the brain, or in other organs of importance, are no le&s;s certainly the cau&s;e which de&s;troys life. In both in&s;tances the de&s;ign of nature, if it can be called a de&s;ign, is the &s;ame. The
<PB N="172" REF="033590_0175_0FF7955CB5D5EFC8">
force of the di&s;ea&s;e being turned principally upon one part, the re&s;t of the body is in a great mea&s;ure relieved from its &s;ufferings;&mdash;but the health and &s;tructure of the part are hurt or de&s;troyed by the change; and it depends wholly upon the accidental importance of the organ, upon which this diver&s;ion has been made, whe|ther death or recovery is the con&s;equence. Thus it often happens, that the reputed indications of nature prove the immediate cau&s;es which de&s;troy the exi&s;tence of the individual; a fact not reconcileable, with the in|finite power and wi&s;dom of the Author of our being.</P>
<P>I have in&s;inuated, that the efforts of nature are un|certain and precarious. They depend on accidental determinations to different parts of the body; and I may add, that if we endeavour to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e, which directs the mechani&s;m of the frame, to adopt one &s;pecies of effort, or one mode of determination in pre|ference to another, we &s;hall not perhaps be able to find any other, than a difference in the &s;tates of the powers of life, which re&s;i&s;t de&s;truction with unequal degrees of force in the different parts of the body. Where there is the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, either from the natural or acci|dental circum&s;tances of the con&s;titution, there the di&s;|ea&s;e mo&s;t obviou&s;ly exerts its greate&s;t force: Hence we are &s;ufficiently warranted to conclude, that though the &s;tructure of the human body is perfect with re&s;pect to every purpo&s;e for which it is intended, being only endued with a principle, which re&s;i&s;ts de&s;truction, or per&s;i&s;ts in continuing life to a certain degree; yet that it is extremely defective, if we con&s;ider it as a machine furni&s;hed with a &s;y&s;tem of laws, which have an inva|riable and well directed tendency to re&s;tore health by the mo&s;t judicious and rational efforts. The re&s;tora|tion of health, in con&s;equence of this re-action, or ir|regular determination which takes place in the &s;y&s;tem, is only a circum&s;tance of accident. The &s;kill of man &s;ometimes &s;ucceeds, where the efforts of nature have obviou&s;ly failed.</P>

<HEAD>Of the particular cure of the fever of Jamaica.</HEAD>
<P>THE fever, which prevailed in the di&s;trict of Savan|na-La-Mar, was naturally a di&s;ea&s;e of the remitting kind; yet circum&s;tances were &s;ometimes connected with it, in &s;uch a manner as prevented it from a&s;&s;uming its proper form. To remove tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which thus ma&s;ked or concealed the real genius of the di&s;ea&s;e, was con&s;idered as the fir&s;t &s;tep towards a cure. The accompli&s;hment of this purpo&s;e, however, was &s;ome|times difficult; neither could it always be effected by the &s;ame means. Thus it happened frequently in ca&s;es, where there was exce&s;s of excitement, or a high degree of inflammatory diathe&s;is, that the remi&s;&s;ions where &s;carcely perceptible; as it was likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, that where there was a want of reaction, the paroxi&s;ms were often languid and ob&s;cure. In the one ca&s;e, the remi&s;|&s;ions di&s;covered them&s;elves in con&s;equence of bleeding, dilution and copious evacuation; in the other, wine and cordials determined the di&s;ea&s;e to a&s;&s;ume its proper ge|nuine form.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, evacuations were u&s;ually employed as the means of procuring remi&s;&s;ion, where the inflama|tory diathe&s;is prevailed in exce&s;s; I may add, that they were proper for the mo&s;t part, and that they &s;eldom failed of producing the effect. Bleeding was frequent|ly nece&s;&s;ary, and generally of &s;ervice. Its efficacy, however, was often heightened by particular modes of management. Thus relaxation of &s;pa&s;ms, and removal of inflammatory diathe&s;is, more certainly followed bleeding, if the blood was drawn from a large orifice; if the patient was placed in an erect po&s;ture, during the operation; and more certainly &s;till, if the lower extre|mities were at the &s;ame time immer&s;ed in warm water. When bleeding had been premi&s;ed, and repeated ac|cording to the circum&s;tances and urgency of the ca&s;e, it was then cu&s;tomary to open the body freely: for which purpo&s;e, I have not found any thing an&s;wer bet|ter, than a thin &s;olution of Glauber or Ep&s;om &s;alts, with a &s;mall portion of emetic tartar. The operation of this medicine was exten&s;ive. It might be &s;o managed
<PB N="174" REF="033590_0177_0FF79560B880EF70">
as to occa&s;ion nau&s;ea, or moderate vomiting; to operate bri&s;kly downwards, or to promote a gentle diaphore&s;is. Remi&s;&s;ions were generally the con&s;equence of this me|thod of proceeding, where there was no defect in the manner of conducting it. But where it &s;o happened, that the circum&s;tances of the patient forbad the u&s;e of this laxative; or where it might not be proper to carry it to a &s;ufficient length, benefit was derived from a pow|der, compo&s;ed of nitre, camphire, emetic tartar and opium, given in pretty large do&s;es, and repeated fre|quently. Remi&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t a great abatement in the violence of &s;ymptoms, was generally the con&s;equence of this plan of treatment; particularly, if a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the plentiful dilution of watery liquors, by warm bathing and large gly&s;ters of &s;imple water. It is &s;uperfluous to mention the u&s;e of bli&s;ters in ca&s;es of local affection; but it will be le&s;s expected, that this remedy &s;hould be recommended in fevers, where there is an exce&s;s of the general inflammatory diathe&s;is.&mdash;I can, however, bear te&s;timony to its efficacy. The manner by which bli&s;ters produce their effects, is not yet agreed upon among authors; neither do I pretend to throw any new light upon the &s;ubject; but I would beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t, that the mode of affording relief in the pre&s;ent, at lea&s;t, did not &s;eem to be much unlike the effect of local af|fections, in con&s;equence of which the violence of fevers is &s;ometimes ob&s;erved to &s;ub&s;ide.</P>
<P>I pur&s;ued the above method of procuring remi&s;&s;ion in tho&s;e fevers, were there was real inflammatory dia|the&s;is prevailing in exce&s;s; but it &s;o happened, that the &s;igns of this diathe&s;is were fallacious, appearing in &s;ome in&s;tances to be pre&s;ent, though the real genius of the di&s;ea&s;e was actually of a different nature; a cir|cum&s;tance, which occa&s;ioned a difference of manage|ment in conducting the method of cure. Exce&s;&s;ive evacuations were not only un&s;afe in &s;uch ca&s;es, but in general had not any powerful effects in di&s;po&s;ing the di&s;ea&s;e to a&s;&s;ume a remitting form. Bleeding, how|ever, was often found to be nece&s;&s;ary, though it was &s;eldom requi&s;ite to repeat the operation. The good effects which were ob&s;erved to follow the u&s;e of cathar|tics,
<PB N="175" REF="033590_0178_0FF795640C70F3A8">
were not in general very remarkable; yet it was proper, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, to open the body freely; for which purpo&s;e, no form of medicine, with which I am acquainted, an&s;wered better than a &s;olution of &s;alts with a &s;mall portion of emetic tartar, and &s;ometimes with the addition of laudanum. In ca&s;es of local pain, bli&s;ters applied near the &s;eat of affection were always of eminent &s;ervice; and in ca&s;es of general irritability, they were often equally u&s;eful, when applied to the back part of the head and neck. A powder compo&s;ed of nitre, camphire, emetic tartar and opium, was like|wi&s;e employed with &s;ucce&s;s; but the liberal u&s;e of warm bathing, was &s;till more to be depended upon. No per&s;on, perhaps, will refu&s;e con&s;ent to the method of proceeding, which I have hitherto recommended; but when I mention a free and bold u&s;e of cold bathing, even in an early &s;tage of this fever, I do not expect the &s;ame conce&s;&s;ion. To da&s;h cold water on the head and &s;houlders of a per&s;on in a fever, has an appearance of ra&s;hne&s;s and hazard. I can, however, produce the te&s;timony of repeated experience for the &s;afety of the practice, no le&s;s than for its &s;ucce&s;s in procuring remi&s;|&s;ion; and &s;hall therefore con&s;ider it a duty to recom|mend it warmly to the public. Wherever it was em|ployed,&mdash;and the ca&s;es in which it was tried were nu|merous, a calm and equable per&s;piration, additional tone and vigor, with great abatement of irritability, were con&s;tantly ob&s;erved to en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The paroxi&s;ms and remi&s;&s;ions were generally di&s;tinct in the beginning of fevers, where the nervous &s;y&s;tem was principally affected; but often became le&s;s &s;o, as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced in its progre&s;s; a circum&s;tance which did not ari&s;e oftner from the nature of the com|plaint, than from the common method of treatment. Bleeding was often di&s;pen&s;ed with in the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies; but vomiting and purging were indulged in with freedom. The di&s;tinction of paroxi&s;m and re|mi&s;&s;ion was &s;ometimes evidently rendered ob&s;cure by this practice; while it was likewi&s;e obviou&s;ly re&s;tored again, by the u&s;e of wine and cordials, which excited the powers of life. In this &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e, evacua|tions
<PB N="176" REF="033590_0179_0FF795659D66BFA8">
were &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary; &s;eldom indeed admi&s;&s;ible in a great extent. Bleeding, unle&s;s under particular circum|&s;tances, was totally improper. Cathartics were &s;ome|times dangerous, and antimonial vomits often &s;unk the patient irrecoverably. Bli&s;tering, on the contrary, even at an early period, was generally of &s;ervice; as al&s;o were opiates, and a judicious u&s;e of the warm bath; but cold bathing with &s;alt water, was, of all others, the remedy of the mo&s;t powerful effect. I do not pretend to &s;ay, that it ab&s;olutely &s;topped the cour&s;e of the fe|ver; but I can &s;ay with truth, that it generally re&s;tored the di&s;tinction of paroxi&s;m and remi&s;&s;ion, dimini&s;hed irritability, and imparted a degree of tone and vigour to the &s;y&s;tem, which was ju&s;tly con&s;idered as a &s;ign of &s;afety.</P>
<P>To procure remi&s;&s;ion in fever, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a prevalence of the putre&s;cent tendency, is not in every in&s;tance an ea&s;y ta&s;k. A remitting, with marks of &s;pecific putrefaction, is not a di&s;ea&s;e of common occur|rence in Jamaica; but a fever with &s;igns of putrefac|tive tendency, mixed with &s;ymptoms of great irritabi|lity, or a high decree of malignity, is not altogether rare. From the complicated nature of the di&s;order, the indications of cure are often difficult and perplex|ed. Bleeding is univer&s;ally condemned; more, I be|lieve, from theory than from actual ob&s;ervation. It was, and perhaps &s;till is, a fa&s;hionable mode of rea&s;on|ing, to impute the languors and other marks of debi|lity, which are common in the fevers of the We&s;t-In|dies, to a putre&s;cent tendency in the &s;y&s;tem. Such &s;ymptoms however are in fact more generally the at|tendants, or di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;igns of fevers, where the nervous &s;y&s;tem is affected. In &s;uch ca&s;es, bleeding is obviou&s;ly hurtful; in the one of which we now treat, (where &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e actually exi&s;ts,) it is not only a remedy of &s;afety, but of very eminent &s;ervice, previous to the application of cold, particularly previous to cold bathing, which may be u&s;ed with freedom and bold|ne&s;s. Cold bathing, indeed, is the remedy on which we mu&s;t principally depend. There are others which do good occa&s;ionally; but this is the only one I know,
<PB N="177" REF="033590_0180_0FF79568244F74B8">
which has any very con&s;iderable effect in changing the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e. There is a general rule in the practice of medicine, which a requires to be particularly remembered in tho&s;e complicated &s;pecies of fever, viz. that as the indications of cure are often embarra&s;&s;ed; &s;o the appearances, which principally point to danger, are fir&s;t to be attended to; while the plan of cure, which we determine to be the mo&s;t proper, mu&s;t be followed up with vigour and re&s;olution. We ought always to bear in mind, that in dangerous and difficult ca&s;es feeble remedies, or even powerful ones timidly u&s;ed, are of little avail. Cold bathing, employed with timidity, failed of doing good in &s;ome in&s;tances. I met with no example, where the bolde&s;t u&s;e of it did harm. It was &s;eldom, I mu&s;t again repeat, that it did not &s;ucceed in obviating irritability, in checking the putre&s;cent tendency, and in imparting to the &s;y&s;tem that degree of tone and vigour, in which &s;afety is ob|&s;erved to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The method of procuring remi&s;&s;ion, in tho&s;e fevers which were di&s;tingui&s;hed by local affections, or irregular determinations to particular parts, was nice, and &s;ome|times difficult. Bleeding was frequently proper, e&s;peci|ally, if there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at the &s;ame time marks of a gene|ral inflammatory diathe&s;is: but it was &s;eldom &s;ufficient wholly to accompli&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s. However, together with a judicious management of warm bathing, it greatly heightened the good effects of bli&s;ters, the remedy on which the principal dependence was placed. In fevers which were accompanied with uncommon pain of the head, I have &s;ometimes found it &s;erviceable to apply cold to the part affected; the feet being at the &s;ame time immer&s;ed in warm water, and blood flowing by a large orifice from the arm. I al&s;o frequently ob&s;erved, that the general fever ran higher, though it likewi&s;e more certainly a&s;&s;umed its proper form, in con&s;equence of bleeding, bli&s;tering, and the removal of local pain. In tho&s;e fevers, where bilious appearances were the effect of accidental, irregular determination to the &s;to|mach or liver, the remi&s;&s;ions were often ob&s;cure: nei|ther did the method of treatment, which was generally
<PB N="178" REF="033590_0181_0FF79569B53546E0">
adopted, &s;eem to be well calculated to bring forth the natural, genuine appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e. Bilious appearances. it mu&s;t be owned, &s;ometimes vani&s;hed, while the type of the fever became more di&s;tinct after the exhibition of an emetic or bri&s;k cathartic; yet there is cau&s;e to doubt if this depended on the evacuation of bile. It might be &s;aid, with more truth, perhaps, that the action of the emetic, by exciting the powers of the &s;tomach and biliary &s;y&s;tem, effected a change in the irregular determination, which had formerly taken place to tho&s;e parts. It was generally ob&s;erved, where good effects did not follow the fir&s;t exhibition of re|medies of this kind, that harm was u&s;ually the con&s;e|quence of a &s;econd. Vomiting, in &s;hort, was often ren|dered continual, and the di&s;tinction of paroxi&s;m and remmi&s;&s;ion was apparently de&s;troyed, in con&s;equence of the operation of violent emetics. In&s;tructed by repeated examples of their hurtful effects, I at la&s;t &s;carcely ever employed antimonial vomits; even the &s;afe&s;t kind were u&s;ed with caution. If it appeared, at any time, that the action of vomiting would be &s;erviceable, camomile tea, or at farthe&s;t a few grains of ipecacuana were gene|rally thought &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e. When this bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed, a draught of cordial &s;timulating liquor, which had a tendency to promote a diaphore&s;is, was next admini&s;tered. By this mode of treatment, e&s;pecially if a bli&s;ter was applied at the &s;ame time to the region of the liver, I have the &s;atisfaction to add, that the bilious appearances for the mo&s;t part vani&s;hed, and, if care was taken to &s;upport a determination to the &s;urface, &s;eldom ever returned during the continu|ance of the fever. Different &s;ea&s;ons, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> different &s;itu|ations of country were particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by cor|re&s;ponding determinations. Thus a tendency to the bowels and biliary &s;y&s;tem was chiefly remarkab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in the autumnal months, and in low and champaign countries; the head and brea&s;t were oftener affected in the winter months, and in hilly &s;ituations.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved before, that it is the fir&s;t object in the cure of fevers, to remove tho&s;e circum&s;tances, or acci|dental &s;tates of the body, which hinder the di&s;ea&s;e from
<PB N="179" REF="033590_0182_0FF7956C32859FD0">
a&s;&s;uming its proper form. Thus, to procure remi&s;&s;ion, appeared univer&s;ally to be the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s in the cure of the fever of Jamaica; the next, and a very impor|tant one, is to prevent the return of the paroxi&s;m. If we knew a remedy, which could be depended upon to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e with certainty, the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e would be ea&s;y; but the Peruvian bark, which almo&s;t infallibly &s;tops the cour&s;e of intermitting fevers in all countries, does not &s;eem &s;o indi&s;putably to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame power over the u&s;ual endemic of the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the different methods of treat|ment, by which it was attempted to procure remi&s;&s;ion in the endemic fever of Jamaica, and having likewi&s;e edeavoured to a&s;certain how far we can go in prevent|ing the return of paroxi&s;ms, it only remains to detail &s;ome particulars in the management of the plan of cure, where the different &s;pecies of fevers were di&s;tingui&s;hed by a peculiar train of &s;ymptoms. It was ob&s;erved in general, that fevers, with a moderate degree of inflam|matory diathe&s;is, &s;eldom required our interference. The di&s;ea&s;e, after a certain duration, terminated u&s;ually of its own accord, After I had gained &s;ome experience of the general cour&s;e of fevers, I u&s;ually allowed tho&s;e, in which I did not perceive marks of danger, to go on their own way, that I might better di&s;cover tho&s;e pe|riods, at which the di&s;ea&s;e was naturally di&s;po&s;ed to ter|minate. Thus where the paroxi&s;ms continued regu|lar and di&s;tinct, the remi&s;&s;ions perfect, and the vigour unimpaired, nothing material was attempted to be done. On the contrary, where the paroxi&s;ms were long, or le&s;s di&s;tinctly formed, with &s;igns which indicated an ap|proaching affection of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, bark, and other remedies, which excited and &s;upported the pow|ers of life, were given with the earlie&s;t opportunity. Changes from inflammatory diathe&s;is to nervous affec|tion, were ob&s;erved to happen frequently on the fifth day. Bark, and &s;uch remedies as imparted tone and vigour to the &s;y&s;tem, were given without delay; and the di&s;ea&s;e terminated for the mo&s;t part on the ninth. In tho&s;e fevers, which were of a complicated nature,
<PB N="180" REF="033590_0183_0FF7956EA6344218">
in which &s;igns of inflammatory, nervous, or putrid dia|the&s;is were variou&s;ly mixed, bli&s;ters, applied in different manners, opiates, bathing and anti&s;pa&s;modics were of|ten materially u&s;eful; but it would be arrogance to attempt to de&s;cribe rules for the particular mode of ap|plication, which mu&s;t vary more or le&s;s in almo&s;t every ca&s;e, and which only can be learned from actual ob&s;er|vation. There is one rule, however, in the treatment of fevers, of which the practitioner ought never to lo&s;e fight, viz. that wherever it was nece&s;&s;ary to interfere, it is only the mo&s;t vigorous deci&s;ion which can do good. We cannot, as is &s;aid before, depend with certainty upon bark as a remedy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of ab&s;o|lutely cutting &s;hort the cau&s;e of the fever of Jamaica; yet wherever the fevers of that country di&s;covered &s;igns of nervous affection, I do not know any thing in the materia medica, from which &s;uch beneficial effects may be expected. If it did not actually &s;top the di&s;ea&s;e, it was eminently &s;erviceable in conducting it to a favour|able i&s;&s;ue. Opium, wine, &s;nake-root, &amp;c. were often ob&s;erved to heighten its good qualities: but the parti|cular u&s;e of &s;uch additions can only be regulated by cir|cum&s;tances. Wine has been freely recommended in fevers with &s;ymptoms of nervous affection; and it mu&s;t be owned, that its good effects were con&s;iderable, not only in real debility, but wherever the cau&s;e of the di&s;|ea&s;e acted by weakening or depre&s;&s;ing the powers of life. Wine was likewi&s;e ob&s;erved to be more u&s;eful in ca&s;es of mobility and weakne&s;s, than in ca&s;es of &s;tupor and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the nervous influence. But though it is actually a remedy of great value, its virtues appear to have been greatly enhanced. In many in&s;tances it was not proper in any quantity: in &s;ome, it was only proper in a &s;mall quantity, and in very few, perhaps, could we allow of the quantities which are given in common practice. At one time I carried the u&s;e of wine in the nervous fever of Jamaica, to a very great l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngth; but I afterwards learnt, that a third part of the quantity would have probably an&s;wered the purpo&s;e better. Though it undoubtedly is an u&s;eful cordial and tonic, it is &s;till inferior to cool air, and particularly to cold bathing.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="033590_0184_0FF7957187894688">It is an opinion, which &s;eems to date its origin from Hippocrates, that bile vitiated in quality, or redundant in quantity, de&s;erves to be con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of the &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of ar|dent fever: and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the frequent appearance of bilious di&s;charges, in the fevers of hot climates, gives countenance to the &s;uppo&s;ition. From the frequency of this &s;ymptom, perhaps, the practition|ers of the We&s;t-Indies adopted the idea, that bile is the cau&s;e of the fever of that country; while the method of cure, which they u&s;ually pur&s;ue, has &s;erved to con|firm them in their error. Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opinion of the prevalence of bile, they admini&s;ter cathartics and emetics with a liberal hand. If bile appears in the fir&s;t evacuations, they con&s;ider it &s;ufficient authority to pro|ceed; if it does not appear, they conclude that the remedy has not been of &s;ufficient force to reach the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e; and therefore per&s;i&s;t in their in|tentions, till the effect is at la&s;t produced. It is well known, that a repetition of cathartics and emetics &s;el|dom fails to produce the appearances of a bilious di&s;|ea&s;e. Hence this &s;ymptom of fever, and all the dan|gers which follow it, are frequently the work of our own hands. That this is the ca&s;e, appears from a re|lation of the method of cure, which I u&s;ually adopted in &s;uch fevers as were di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ymptoms of this nature at an early period. In&s;tead of encouraging the vomiting, or promoting the evacuation of bile downwards, I generally did every thing in my power to moderate, or even to check it.&mdash;Sometimes I pre|&s;cribed an emetic; but it was more with a view to ex|cite the action of the &s;tomach and biliary &s;y&s;tem, than to promote an evacuation of redundant or vitiated hu|mours. After the operation of vomiting was fini&s;hed, a bli&s;ter was u&s;ually applied to the region of the liver, and &s;uch a plan of cure was pur&s;ued, as &s;upported a de|termination to the &s;urface of the body, and gave tone and vigour to the &s;tomach and general powers of life. By this mode of treatment, bilious appearances vani&s;hed &s;peedily, or cea&s;ed to be trouble&s;ome; while by the re|peated u&s;e of emetics and cathartics, they generally
<PB N="182" REF="033590_0185_0FF79573FB403A68">
continued long and often prevailed throughout the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. We may thus, I hope, conclude, without any unnatural inference, that there appears to be danger in encouraging tho&s;e tumults, which have been u&s;ually con&s;idered as the efforts of nature. If they are in fact efforts, no per&s;on can pretend to deny, that they are generally precarious; nay, that they are often the immediate cau&s;es of death.</P>
<P>I have now detailed the particular &s;teps of the method of cure, which I adopted in the remitting fever of Ja|maica; a di&s;ea&s;e which I treated, in &s;ome re&s;pects, on a different plan, and, if &s;elf-love hath not blinded me, with more &s;ucce&s;s than the generality of tho&s;e practitioners whom I had the opportunity of knowing. I treated the di&s;ea&s;e with &s;ucce&s;s; but I dare not affirm, as &s;ome have done, that under this method, of treatment, I never lo&s;t a patient. I proceeded, indeed, with di&s;&s;idence and di&s;|tru&s;t of the powers of the medical art; venturing no farther than to &s;upport the general powers of life, and to obviate &s;ymptoms of a fatal tendency. Many pre|tend to cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of fevers, by the force of a &s;ingle remedy; but the means do not appear very ob|vious, and the effect was often precarious. I grant, that it is &s;ometimes in the power of the practitioner to exterminate the cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e by forcible means, or to de&s;troy a certain aptitude of con&s;titution, in which this di&s;ea&s;e may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t; but I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time ob&s;erve, that there is danger likewi&s;e, lea&s;t he extingui&s;hed life. The bark, which has been &s;o much celebrated for checking the cour&s;e of fevers, though generally &s;afe, was &s;eldom effectual: others are frequently dangerous. During the time that I re|mained in the We&s;t-Indies, I ob&s;erved attentively the &s;tate of body, which u&s;ually attended recovery; as like|wi&s;e tho&s;e appearances which preceded, and apparently were the cau&s;es of death. Tone and vigour, or a mo|derate degree of the &s;tate of body di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of inflammatory diathe&s;is, without local affec|tion, afforded the &s;ure&s;t &s;igns of &s;afety; general failure of the powers of life, or irregular determinations to organs of importance, were the mo&s;t certain appear|ances
<PB N="183" REF="033590_0186_0FF7957750E93170">
of danger. Thus, after obviating particular &s;ymptoms of a fatal tendency, it was the principal in|dication to &s;upport the general powers of life, or to excite the tone and vigour of the &s;y&s;tem. This was be&s;t accompli&s;hed by bark, wine, cool air, and above all, by cold bathing, which I am induced to con&s;ider as the mo&s;t important remedy in the cure of the fevers of the We&s;t-Indies; and, perhaps, in the cure of the fevers of all hot climates. Though it might not ab|&s;olutely cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; yet it &s;el|dom failed to change the fatal tendency of its nature."</P>
<P>The experienced LIND informs us, in his 5th edition, that, "When an European is taken ill of a fever (in hot countries) during a &s;ea&s;on of prevailing &s;ickne&s;s in tho&s;e countries, it is nece&s;&s;ary to endeavour, by the mo&s;t efficacious means, to bring it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to a remi&s;&s;ion, that the <HI>bark</HI> may be admini&s;tered with|out delay.</P>
<P>With this view, the phy&s;ician is to con&s;ider how far the violence of the fever in its fir&s;t attack, will admit of bleeding; but he mu&s;t remember that this operation is in general to be u&s;ed with great caution, and the re|petition of it with &s;till greater in tho&s;e climates.</P>
<P>The chief objects of attention in all &s;uch fevers, are the contents of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines. Upon the patient's fir&s;t complaint, and during the fir&s;t hours of the fever, while perhaps he is only chilly, or complains of alternate fits of heat and cold, the &s;tomach and in|te&s;tines &s;hould be immediately clean&s;ed, either by a vomit, a purge, or by an oily purging cly&s;ter: after which the patient may immediately take an antimonial draught, and repeat it every &s;ix hours.</P>

<P>"A fever is a di&s;ea&s;e which no knowledge of the &s;tructure of the human body, as far as it is at pre&s;ent known, no knowledge of the properties of the fluids, as far as they have hitherto been inve&s;tigated, no know|ledge of the action of the moving parts, as far as they have hitherto been ob&s;erved, could give the &s;malle&s;t ground of &s;uppo&s;ition, that this di&s;ea&s;e could never have exi&s;ted. In &s;howing its hi&s;tory, therefore, ob&s;ervation of the di&s;ea&s;e is to be entirely adhered to, without any rea&s;oning why, or how any thing in it takes place, or without any theory, as it has been called. It would be ju&s;t as fruitle&s;s, at lea&s;t for any u&s;eful purpo&s;e, as if a geographer were not to de&s;cribe a country, but rea&s;on why a hill &s;hould be placed in one region, a valley in an other; why one &s;hore is rocky, another &s;andy; in&s;tead of actually giving the &s;ituation of the hills and valleys, the rockyne&s;s or &s;andyne&s;s of the &s;hores.</P>
<P>A great many more fevers begin between eight in the morning and eight in the evening, than take place between eight in the evening and eight in the morning. There is a remarkable difference; according to the au|thor's ob&s;ervation, at lea&s;t ten fevers take place between eight in the morning and eight in the evening, for one that takes place between eight in the evening and eight in the morning.</P>
<P>It is to be remembered, that the hi&s;tory of fever &s;hould be given as it ari&s;es from ob&s;ervation, and not from any &s;uppo&s;ition. It is not therefore pretended to be under&s;tood, why this difference of proportion &s;hould take place. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;un's pa&s;&s;age over the meridian has an effect, but there does not appear to be any ground for this, becau&s;e the num|ber of fir&s;t attacks of fever, which take place at noon, or near it, are not remarkably greater than tho&s;e which
<PB N="186" REF="033590_0189_0FF7957DA55966C0">
take place two or three hours &s;ooner or later. In &s;hort, fever is a di&s;ea&s;e, the whole of the appearances of which have been in no ways accounted for.</P>
<P>It has often been &s;uppo&s;ed that the redundancy of bile con&s;tituted an e&s;&s;ential part of the attack of fever; whereas it is a mere accident. If the pancreatic juice had been blue, and had any particular ta&s;te or &s;mell, and the bile had been colourle&s;s, in&s;ipid, inodorous, or as much &s;o as the pancreatic juice is, in that ca&s;e, what|ever has been &s;aid of the redundancy of bile as en e&s;&s;en|tial part of the attack of fever, would have been &s;aid of the pancreatic juice. It is clear that no experiment hi|therto made public has &s;hown that any bile was ever contained in blood ve&s;&s;els, excepting in ca&s;e of jaun|dice, and that, therefore, there can be no redundancy of bile, excepting as much as can be contained in the biliary ducts, and gall bladder. Much more than this is thrown out by twenty times in the attack of a &s;imple fever in half an hour. Therefore, the bile thrown out is a con&s;equence of the &s;ickne&s;s, exactly in the &s;ame manner as it is a con&s;equence of the &s;ickne&s;s ari&s;ing from the agitation in a &s;hip at &s;ea, and is not at all to be taken farther than as a mere accident in the attack of fever. The lo&s;s of appetite encrea&s;es, and the nau&s;ea and vomiting take place &s;o in&s;tantly at the beginning of fever, that they can hardly be conceived otherwi&s;e than as an affection of the &s;tomach it&s;elf.</P>
<P>All the cau&s;es, to which fevers can be a&s;cribed from ob&s;ervations, are, certain &s;ub&s;tances applied to the bo|dy, as floating in the at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;phere, or applied in a fluid form to &s;ome part of the body. Sudden expo&s;ure to cold. Moi&s;ture in the atmo&s;phere. Moi&s;ture of the cloaths, or other covering of the body. Indige&s;tible food, or other &s;ub&s;tances affecting the inte&s;tinal canal. Sudden ri&s;ing of the pa&s;&s;ions of the mind attended with anxiety. But it happens frequently, that fevers ari&s;e without any of the&s;e circum&s;tances having been known to precede them. They are then to be referred to mar&s;h effluvia or to contagious but invi&s;ible matter.</P>
<P>Of the particular &s;ecreted fluids which have been thought from their redundancy, or alteration of proper|ties,
<PB N="187" REF="033590_0190_0FF79580F8CFAF98" MS="y">
to be cau&s;es of fever, bile has been the mo&s;t fre|quent.</P>
<P>The ancients, who&s;e knowledge of the properties of the matter of the body was very &s;uperficial, and de|pended &s;olely on the external view, on which hypothe|&s;es were founded, &s;uppo&s;ed that the fluids con&s;i&s;ted of red blood, phl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, bile, and black bile, as is well known to tho&s;e who have looked into their writings, and that to a redundancy, or alteration of the qualities of the&s;e, di&s;ea&s;es were principally owing, and this idea has con|tinued down to the pre&s;ent day. Bile is con&s;picuous from its colour and ta&s;te, its colour is varied by &s;ub|&s;tances that it meets with in the inte&s;tines. This dif|ference of appearance has made it be con&s;idered &s;till of great importance in di&s;ea&s;e. But modern enquirers have &s;hown that it is a fluid &s;ecreted only by the liver, is not at all contained in the blood-ve&s;&s;els, but formed out of the &s;ub&s;tances which con&s;titute the blood. There cannot, therefore, be any redundancy of bile in the blood-ve&s;&s;els becau&s;e generally there is no bile con|tained in them at all. Bile may, however, and &s;ome|times does get into the blood-ve&s;&s;els. When it does, being capable of pa&s;&s;ing through all the &s;ecretory or|gans, it &s;oon &s;hows it&s;elf in all the &s;ecreted fluids, by giving them a colour, and converting them into a yel|low dye, and by tinging all the &s;urfaces of the body that are expo&s;ed to the eye, of a yellow colour. When this happens, fever is never known to be produced, or to have followed, or taken place more frequently than in any other &s;tate of the body. Bile, therefore, when it does get into the blood-ve&s;&s;els, never can be accounted a cau&s;e of fever.</P>
<P>When the &s;ecretions of tho&s;e glands which open in|to the inte&s;tinal canal are increa&s;ed from any cau&s;e, the &s;ecretion of bile is increa&s;ed along with that of the pancreatic juice, mucous, &amp;c. When the&s;e encrea&s;e con&s;iderably, they are evacuated upwards or down|wards. Bile being the only con&s;picuous one, from its colour and ta&s;te, has often been attended to while the others have been neglected. There is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o evidence that in the&s;e ca&s;es the liver &s;ecretes a larger proportion of
<PB N="188" REF="033590_0191_0FF795828C842D88">
bile than the other glands of the inte&s;tines their fluids. However that may be, apparently there is a great quan|tity of bile thrown out.</P>
<P>There is no in&s;tance upon record, nor none the au|thor ever knew, where fever more frequently took place after &s;uch increa&s;ed &s;ecretion and evacuation than in any other circum&s;tance. In that &s;ickne&s;s, for example, which is produced by the agitation of a &s;hip, va&s;t quan|tities of bile are often &s;ecreted, and evacuated, yet there is no in&s;tance of fever taking place; in con&s;equence therefore, bile getting into the blood-ve&s;&s;els, or &s;ecret|ed in any quantity, cannot be admitted as a cau&s;e of fe|ver. When &s;o much has been &s;aid by many authors of great eminence about bilious fever, is their authority to be thrown a&s;ide entirely? Certainly no authority but that which ri&s;es from ob&s;ervation and experiment can ever be allowed in true &s;cience. It would be great pity to rob patients of their con&s;olation in being bilious or nervous, but medicine is a &s;cience which never can be comprehended without much &s;tudy, con&s;iderably more than can ever be given to it by per&s;ons following other occupations.</P>
<P>It happens not uncommonly, that there is no cri&s;is takes place after the fir&s;t attack of a fever, but a &s;econd attack takes place before the fir&s;t paroxi&s;m is much di|mini&s;hed, &s;o that the di&s;ea&s;e at fir&s;t puts on the appear|ance of a continued fever. In this ca&s;e, the &s;ub&s;equent attacks are often in the fore part of the day, or if they &s;hould come on at the time of the ordinary returns of a continued fever, <HI>which are in the evening,</HI> they ob&s;erve the tertian type; in either of which ca&s;es, we may ex|pect in a tertian period or two, fir&s;t an imperfect cri&s;is, followed gradually with more perfect ones, till all the cri&s;es are at la&s;t complete. When the cri&s;es are very imperfect at fir&s;t, they almo&s;t always grow gradually more perfect, until it often happens, that they become &s;o perfect, as not to leave behind the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In a temperate or cold country, when the patient is &s;trong, and there are only &s;light remi&s;&s;ions at the be|ginning of an intermittent, or it puts on the appearance
<PB N="189" REF="033590_0192_0FF79584660809C8">
of a continued fever, excepting that the <HI>exacerbations</HI> do not take place in the <HI>evening,</HI> it is not nece&s;&s;ary to give great nouri&s;hment, yet &s;ome is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The Greek phy&s;icians appear plainly not to have allow|ed any food or drink whatever on the fir&s;t days. This &s;eems improper, for if no watery fluid were exhibited, the proportion of fluids in the body would probably be too much dimini&s;hed by the vapour which flies off from the lungs and other external &s;urfaces of the body, and by the nece&s;&s;ary evacuations. Accumulation of &s;ea &s;alt could not take place if neither food nor drink were thrown into the body; but common &s;al ammoniac and pho&s;phoric ammoniac are continually forming by pro|ce&s;&s;es which &s;eem rather to decompo&s;e than to produce blood or other fluids, and would be accumulated. Yet the&s;e might not be detrimental, as water might be form|ed by the &s;ame decompo&s;ition, &s;o as to render their &s;o|lutions equally dilute.</P>
<P>Neither the &s;olids nor fluids of a living body are &s;ub|ject to putrefaction; yet &s;ome portion of the fluids or &s;olids, or both, &s;eem to verge &s;o near putrefaction, as to be converted into mucilaginous matters which are con&s;tantly wa&s;hed off by watery &s;ecretions. Were the quantity of water dimini&s;hed, they might not be carried off, but go &s;till farther on to putrefaction, producing &s;alts and vapours which might be pernicious. On this ac|count it may be nece&s;&s;ary to throw watery fluids in this ca&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e into the blood-ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>When the remi&s;&s;ions and intermi&s;&s;ions of the fever are very imperfect, or when the di&s;ea&s;e at the beginning puts on the appearance of a continued fever, <HI>only that the exacerbations do not take place in the evening,</HI> perhaps it is not nece&s;&s;ary that much chyle &s;hould be formed, becau&s;e when the intermi&s;&s;ions become more perfect, there will be time for food of greater nouri&s;hment to be dige&s;ted, without interfering with the paroxi&s;ms of the di&s;ea&s;e; nouri&s;hment may therefore be out of the que&s;|tion at this time of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Remarks on tho&s;e remedies which appear <HI>not to</HI> have a beneficial effect.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="033590_0193_0FF77E00AC3A0198">"The fir&s;t of the&s;e is evacuation by <HI>bleeding</HI>; a power|ful remedy in many di&s;ea&s;es, but in a regular tertian intermittent, it has not the lea&s;t effect in preventing the paroxi&s;m from taking place, rendering it more regular, inducing more perfect cri&s;is, or rendering the intermi&s;|&s;ions more perfect.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to be a great error in the view of reme|dies employed in fever; practitioners frequently making no di&s;tinction between tho&s;e u&s;ed to cure the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, and tho&s;e employed to remove accidents that have ari&s;en in it, although &s;uch di&s;tinctions are extremely nece&s;&s;ary to be made. If, for example, in the cour&s;e of a tertian, a pleuri&s;y &s;hould happen to ari&s;e, taking away a quantity of blood would be a powerful remedy for the pleuri&s;y, but although the pleuri&s;y were removed, the intermittent tertian would go through its cour&s;e ju&s;t as if no blood had been taken away, except|ing that the patient would be rendered weaker.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are uninformed in medicine expect that di&s;ea&s;es are to be cured by violent remedies and &s;uddenly. The attention of by-&s;tanders is often drawn to practi|tioners who employ &s;trong acrid medicines.

<HEAD>An ABSTRACT of DR. PATTERSON's REMARKS, pub|li&s;hed at London-Derry, in the year 1795.</HEAD>
<P>"SEVERAL authors of con&s;iderable credit, both ancient and modern, have maintained with Dr. Ru&s;h, that malignant di&s;tempers are cau&s;ed by the effluvia from corrupted vegetables; and this opinion they a|dopted from a belief, that the&s;e kind of effluvia, acting as a ferment, produced a putre&s;cent &s;tate in the fluids of the human body. But it appears from experiment, that the vapour of putrefying vegetables, in&s;tead of being a &s;eptic, is a &s;trong anti&s;eptic matter, and pre|&s;erves animal &s;ub&s;tances by the fixed air which it contains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alexander's Experimental Enquiry, chap. v.&mdash;Dob&s;on's Me|dical Commentary on Fixed Air, &s;ect. v.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The ob&s;ervation of Lanci&s;i, that &s;teeped flax and hemp are productive of what he calls a camp-fever, has been copied by many writers as well as Dr. Ru&s;h. It is an ob&s;ervation, however, which &s;hould be received with caution.

On the contrary, the pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, to which Aegypt is obnoxious, have been imputed to other cau&s;es, namely, to the annual inundation of the Nile, and the hot winds from the de&s;erts<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Is it any wonder that Dr. Lind, was mi&s;taken in the cau&s;es of the malignant yellow fever, when he erred &s;o egregiou&s;ly re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of the plague at Grand Cairo, which he has a&s;cribed to the conjuct effects of the inundation of the Nile and the hot winds from the de&s;erts?

<P>Another &s;ource of illu&s;ion is, that in our endeavours to account for epidemical di&s;orders, we are apt to lay hold of every perceptible difference which we di&s;cover in the air, or &s;ituation of places that are attacked, from tho&s;e that are free; and often, without duly examin|ing and con&s;idering the&s;e diver&s;ities, conclude that we have detected the cau&s;e, which is perhaps involved in inextricable difficulty.</P>
<P>It does not appear, that in the We&s;t-Indies, the ut|mo&s;t care in clearing and draining &s;wampy grounds, nor the &s;etting in of cool winds, will prevent the recurrence of the yellow fever among&s;t troops. For we find from Dr. Chi&s;holm that, although the be&s;t means were u&s;ed, yet they did not preclude a fever of this kind, which began in Grenada in September, from returning the December following, with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l its formidable and de&s;|tructive &s;ymptoms.

<HEAD>Of the effluvia from putrefying animal &s;ub&s;tances.</HEAD>
<P>IF Dr. Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h be earne&s;t in imputing the generation of fever to the exhalations from putrefying vegetables, he is on the other hand di&s;po&s;ed to think, "it is much le&s;s common for the effluvia of putrid animal matters to produce fevers.

<P>Together with the &s;everal kinds of air which the ex|halations from putrid vegetable matter contains, that from animal putrefaction is compo&s;ed of a &s;pecies of ala&s;tic fluids, called ammoniacal air and &s;ulphureous ammoniacal air. The&s;e airs are imflammable and very foetid; and phlogi&s;ticate the atmo&s;phere at lea&s;t equal|ly as the effluvium from vegetable putrefaction. They al&s;o contain certain volatilized &s;ub&s;tances, denominated oily, which modify their influence, according to the nature of the matter from whence they proceed. And although they are active, and emit a con&s;iderable &s;tench, yet I &s;o far concur with Dr. Ru&s;h, that I cannot a&s;&s;ent to the doctrine of &s;ome writers, who conceive, that they con&s;titute the mia&s;mata which generate contagious di&s;|ea&s;es. Like putrid vegetable effluvia, I believe they are proper vehicles of contagion; and, therefore, are not principles, but acce&s;&s;ories only. Or, in the language of the &s;y&s;tematic, to whom Dr. Ru&s;h &s;eems attached, every impurity of air dimini&s;hes its &s;timulus; and con|&s;equently impure air, or air blended with impure mat|ters, without doubt debilitates, and produces a&s;thenic diathe&s;is, which prepares the body for the operation of contagion.</P>
<P>That &s;laughter-hou&s;es yield a con&s;iderable quantity of putrid animal effluvium, is certain; e&s;pecially in places circum&s;tanced as Cork is, in this kingdom. It is built on i&s;lands &s;ituated in a deep valley, and &s;ur|rounded by &s;everal branches of the river Lee. The&s;e i&s;lands were naturally mar&s;hy, and &s;ubject to be over|flowed by &s;pring tides, until the ground was rai&s;ed by art. The re&s;t of the mar&s;hes, both on the ea&s;t and we&s;t,
<PB N="196" REF="033590_0199_0FF7964D228B3360">
are periodically covered by tho&s;e tides; and, in the intervals, putrid vapours are exhaling from them. Continued ridges of hills, on which the &s;uburbs are built, bound this vale on the north and &s;outh.</P>
<P>In the north and &s;outh &s;uburbs, the &s;laughter-hou&s;es are numerous; the blood and odure from which are received in va&s;t pits, where they are &s;uffered to putre|fy, and emit &s;uch noi&s;ome &s;teams as corrupt even the mo&s;t whole&s;ome breezes that pa&s;s over the city; and, upon great rains, the&s;e c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s-pools di&s;charge, by the declivities of the hills, their foetid contents into the river. Nor is this &s;ource of impure air confined to the&s;e places; for great quantities of filth and offals croud the &s;treets, and particularly the clo&s;e confined alleys and lanes where that de&s;cription of people re&s;ide, who&s;e circum&s;tances are peculiarly adapted to fo&s;ter and propagate febrile contagion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rogers on Epidemic Di&s;ea&s;es, p. 36, 37.</NOTE></P>
<P>That we &s;eldom hear of fevers being particularly prevalent in the neighbourhood of the work-&s;hops of &s;kinners and curriers, and, I would add, in that of tan-yards, is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing. The proce&s;&s;es, which the hides undergo in the hands of the tanner, prevent the putrid fermentation; and, con&s;equently, the genera|tion of that kind of effluvium favourable to the action of contagious mia&s;mata, is primarily oppo&s;ed. The &s;mell i&s;&s;uing from tan-yards (which by the bye, very much re&s;embles that from &s;teeped flax) however offen|&s;ive, &s;eems to be very different from that which is emitted from putrefying animal &s;ub&s;tances; and pro|bably is owing to principles which do not adequately phlogi&s;ticate the air. If this be the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to tan-yards, certainly the work-&s;hops of tho&s;e trades|men, &s;kinners and curriers, who receive the &s;kins al|mo&s;t entirely freed from the corruptible parts, will be &s;till le&s;s chargeable with being the &s;ource of contami|nating effluvia.</P>
<P>Several facts tend to prove, that very foul animal effluvia will not excite fever, without the concurrence
<PB N="197" REF="033590_0200_0FF77E082A6174F0">
of &s;pecific contagion. Two men travelling on foot in the county of Kent, were a&s;&s;aulted near a town on the road with an extremely loath&s;ome &s;tench, which they imagined aro&s;e from animal putrefaction, and which continued to offend them for the &s;pace of two hours. The &s;ky was clear without the lea&s;t cloud; and, from the direction of the wind, this vapour could neither come from the unwhole&s;ome air of Sheppey i&s;land, nor from the muddy banks of the river Thames or Med|way, nor from the Rhumney mar&s;hes. Yet the&s;e men neither grew &s;ick at the time, nor experienced any future inconvenience from this foetid exhalation.</P>
<P>The offen&s;ive &s;mell, proceeding even from the excre|mentitious di&s;charges of patients confined with non-fe|brile di&s;ea&s;es, does not occa&s;ion pure fever. In a bilious colic, the evacuations both upwards and downwards, have been &s;o intolerably offen&s;ive, as to produce &s;to|mach &s;ickne&s;s and retchings in one ca&s;e, and giddine&s;s, vomiting, and tremor, in another; yet fixed fewer does not appear to have been the con&s;equence in either.</P>
<P>Many in&s;tances have occurred, in which thou&s;ands of dead bodies have been left to putrefy on the field of battle, without cau&s;ing putrid fever; and it is well known, that in no ca&s;e has the origin of this di&s;ea&s;e been traced to the effluvia of &s;ubjects in a di&s;&s;ecting room. Nor have fevers been ob&s;erved to originate, or to rage more &s;everely, in hou&s;es &s;urrounding grave|yards, in the middle of large towns, though the &s;tench of the bodies accumulated in &s;uch receptacles, is often intolerably offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;es which have been brought to &s;hew, that infectious effluvia ari&s;e from putrefying bodies, it does not appear that they produced any &s;ymptoms re&s;em|bling tho&s;e of pe&s;tilential fever; on the contrary, they acted by direct &s;timulus, exciting inflammatory com|plaints; from which it may be inferred, that they are e&s;&s;entially different from febrile contagion.</P>
<P>I may now fairly conclude, that pe&s;tilential <HI>fever</HI> is not generated by mar&s;h mia&s;ma, by the effluvia from &s;tagnant water, nor by the exhalations from putrid vegetable nor animal &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="033590_0201_0FF79593B36E7D18">That the yellow fever at Philadelphia did not ari&s;e from the effluvium of the rotten coffee, is an inference &s;trongly corroborated by the facts and rea&s;oning con|tained in the preceding &s;ection.</P>
<P>But that the di&s;ea&s;e was really imported from the We&s;t-Indies by means of three ve&s;&s;els, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">melia, Sans Culottes, and Flora, appears to be rendered almo&s;t cer|tain from the judgement and accuracy with which it was traced to its former &s;ource.

<P>This declaration of the College, if it required any &s;upport, is materially &s;trengthened by the te&s;timony even of one of the di&s;&s;entients, Dr. Redman. the pre|&s;ident. For we are told by Mr. Carey, that from this phy&s;ician's notes it appears, that, when the yellow fe|ver occurred in Philadelphia, in 1762, it was introduced by a mariner, who arrived ill with it from the Ha|vannah, and who, having taken lodging, communicated the di&s;ea&s;e to the family where he re&s;ided, from whence it &s;pread by contagion to other parts of the city.</P>

<P>Moreover, on the pre&s;umption that the fever was en|gendered by the effluvia from either vegetable or an|imal &s;ub&s;tances putrefying upon the wharfs, how are we to explain its appearing in Ken&s;ington, where tho&s;e mia&s;mata could not reach undiluted, about the &s;ame time that Dr. Ru&s;h was called to vi&s;it Dr. Hodge's child near the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e of infection?&mdash;On &s;uch a pre&s;umption, the cotemporary vi&s;itation of the di&s;ea&s;e in Ken&s;ington and Water-&s;treet is inexplicable. But on the ground of its being imported from the We&s;t-Indies, that occurrence may be accounted for in a &s;a|tisfactory manner, by alleging that &s;ome of the &s;ailors, pa&s;&s;engers, or articles from tainted ve&s;&s;els made their way to Ken&s;ington very &s;oon after their arrival in port. The fact indeed is, that &s;ome Dani&s;h &s;ailors and other per&s;ons, who had been in the neighbourhood of the infected places, carried, the fever to that village; and, that the&s;e people caught the di&s;ea&s;e by contagion, we mu&s;t continue to believe, until we have better rea&s;ons for a&s;cribing its origin to the damaged coffee, than tho&s;e we are yet furni&s;hed with on the affirmative &s;ide of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The &s;ame opinion is entertained by a well-known and ju&s;tly celebrated profe&s;&s;or, Dr. Duncan, who is very conver&s;ant in medical inquiry, and who writes thus: "Indeed, when we con&s;ider, that it is on all hands allowed, that the di&s;ea&s;e after making its appearance, was propagated only by contagion, it &s;eems much more probable, that the contagion it&s;elf was imported, than that it originated in Philadelphia; e&s;pecially when we reflect, that at the time of its fir&s;t appearance in that city, and for many months before, it had raged with great &s;everity in different We&s;t-India i&s;lands, from whence there were frequent arrivals at Philadelphia."</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a review of the preceding Ob&s;ervations and Ab&s;tracts, it appears, that the remitting or bilious fever as it is commonly called, is only a variety of the intermitting fever, occa&s;ioned by an invi&s;ible matter, (known to exi&s;t only from its effects) derived from dead vegetable and animal matter, in a &s;tate of putre|faction; that it is di&s;tingui&s;hed by an evident remi&s;&s;ion or abatement, but not a total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or ce&s;&s;ation of all the febrile &s;ymptoms once in the cour&s;e of every twenty-four hours, mo&s;t commonly in the morning, and a renewal and increa&s;e of the &s;ame before the evening; differing in this as well as other circum&s;tances, from the typhus, or continued fever, occa&s;ioned by human contagion, in which there is almo&s;t always an exacer|bation or increa&s;e of the fever later in the evening.&mdash; That the nearer it approaches to or re&s;embles the in|termitting type, the greater is the pro&s;pect of &s;afety. That the paroxi&s;ms are prolonged and intermi&s;&s;ions pre|vented, or rendered imperfect, by two oppo&s;ite cir|cum&s;tances, viz: by a <HI>phlogi&s;tic</HI> diathe&s;is, and by pre|ternatural <HI>depre&s;&s;ion of &s;trength.</HI></P>
<P>That this kind of fever is not contagious or commu|nicated from one per&s;on to another, and that it differs from the malignant yellow fever, not only in that re|&s;pect, but in its cau&s;es, nature and &s;ymptoms, as well as in the remedies requi&s;ite for its cure; as mu&s;t be &s;trikingly evident to every one that is capable of tracing effects to cau&s;es and will take the trouble to read the account of its origin and progre&s;s in Grenada in the year 1793, previous to its appearance in Philadelphia, publi&s;hed by Dr. Chi&s;holm, and recollects that it had not made its appearance in Philadelphia for the &s;pace of thirty-one years before, though the &s;ummers had frequently, during that period, been as warm and dry, and &s;ome of them more &s;o, and the &s;treets and wharves
<PB N="208" REF="033590_0211_0FF795AB22E8B0F8">
more replete with putrefying matters, and the air with the additional exhalations from the deep trenches and muddy docks, the receptacles of every kind of filth and impurity, as well as from the &s;tagnant water of the &s;uburbs and adjacent mar&s;hes, &s;ources which had neither a local habitation or a name in 1793&mdash;And that the fever was occa&s;ioned by foreign contagion la&s;t &s;ummer, a committee of the College of Phy&s;icians has furni&s;hed the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate with ample and unequivocal evidence.</P>
<P>It al&s;o appears from the ab&s;tracts of the opinions and practice of different phy&s;icians, that no general or in|fallible rule can be e&s;tabli&s;hed with regard to blood-letting in remitting fevers derived from mar&s;h mia&s;|mata; for we find &s;ome of the &s;ame authors that re|commend this remedy at one period of the di&s;ea&s;e or at a particular &s;ea&s;on, condemn it at a different &s;ea&s;on, or at a different period, or in a different &s;ituation.</P>
<P>General and indi&s;criminate recommendation or in|terdiction of blood-letting, be&s;ides being inconclu&s;ive, have been too often founded upon &s;ome favourite but uncertain hypothe&s;is in&s;tead of being derived from ob|&s;ervations of its effects in different con&s;titutions, and under different circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>That blood may be drawn when certain circum|&s;tances are pre&s;ent in every kind and variety of fever, if not with advantage, yet certainly without injury, no one conver&s;ant with medical facts will deny. The dif|ficulty is to know tho&s;e circum&s;tances when they are pre&s;ent, and the quantity of blood requi&s;ite to be drawn to produce the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible advantage. Symptoms are the only guides we have to this knowledge; but the &s;ymptoms which conduct to this knowledge can only be di&s;tingui&s;hed by men of accurate ob&s;ervation and exten&s;ive experience.</P>
<P>Great diver&s;ity of opinion al&s;o unfortunately exi&s;ts among the phy&s;icians in the We&s;t-Indies, as well as in this country, re&s;pecting the effects of blood-letting in the malignant yellow fever, owing in a great mea&s;ure I believe to its having been employed, too indi&s;criminate|ly, too lavi&s;hly, too frequently, or at too late a period
<PB N="209" REF="033590_0212_0FF795ACFB6CC0D8">
of the di&s;ea&s;e, the nature and progre&s;s of which had not been &s;ufficiently attended to. My experience and ob|&s;ervations in the year 1793, as well as la&s;t year, war|rant me in affirming, that I found blood-letting not only a &s;afe, but an indi&s;pen&s;able remedy in every ca&s;e connected with unequivocal &s;ymptoms of inflamma|tion; &s;uch as acute pain in the head, &s;tomach, or bow|els, and hard, ten&s;e, chorded or contracted pul&s;e, whe|ther it felt &s;mall or full, and e&s;pecially if tho&s;e &s;ymp|toms continued without very &s;en&s;ible abatement more than twelve or fourteen hours.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I have always ob&s;erved that it increa&s;ed the debility, and accelerated the fatal termi|nation of the di&s;ea&s;e, in almo&s;t every ca&s;e which com|menced with great pro&s;tration of &s;trength, extreme anxiety and oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;en&s;e of weight about the epiga&s;tric and hypochondric regions, accompanied with a &s;mall, quick, irregular pul&s;e, little alteration of heat on the &s;urface, hurried and interrupted re&s;piration, frequent and deep &s;ighing, dejection of mind and con|&s;tant re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, and e&s;pecially, if tho&s;e &s;ymptoms con|tinued without &s;en&s;ible and di&s;tinct abatement, more than eighteen or twenty-hours.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o &s;een blood-letting, when employed in the remi&s;&s;ions, where the &s;ymptoms were by no means alarming or unfavourable in appearance, bring on faint|ings, and convul&s;ions, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, death.</P>
<P>It can not therefore, be too often repeated, that it requires that judgment which can only be acquired by exten&s;ive experience and attentive ob&s;ervation, to en|able a phy&s;ician to di&s;tingui&s;h the circum&s;tances which require or ju&s;tify the employment of a remedy which &s;eldom fails of doing either good or harm.</P>

<HEAD>Exhibiting a Sketch of Facts and Reflections relative to the malignant Fever, commonly called the We&s;t-India Yellow Fever.</HEAD>
<P>A CONTAGIOUS fever called the We&s;t-India yellow fever, has occurred at Philadelphia <HI>&s;ix times</HI> &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the city, viz:&mdash;In the years 1699, 1741, 1747, 1762, 1793, and 1797. The &s;ame kind of fever prevailed in Charle&s;ton, the capital of South-Carolina, in the years 1700, 1732, 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">9, 174<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and 1748. A few ca&s;es al&s;o occurred in the years 1792 and 1794, but it did not become epidemic in the years la&s;t mentioned. It prevailed in Virginia in the years 1741, 1747, and 1795. At Baltimore, the capital of Mary|land, in 1794. At New-York, in 1743, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">91, and 1795. At New-Haven, in Connecticut, in the years 1743, and 1794. In the capital of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts in the year 1796.</P>
<P>An account of the contagious fever which prevailed in Philadelphia in the year 1699, is contained in the Journal of Thomas Story, E&s;q. City Recorder. The mortality was greate&s;t in September, and cea&s;ed entirely by the 1&s;t of November. Mr. John Gough, in his hi&s;|tory of the Society of Friends, (vol. 3d, p. 516) &s;ays, this fever "was the di&s;ea&s;e which has &s;ince been cal|led the yellow fever;" and that it had for a con&s;ide|rable time before, been very mortal in &s;everal of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands.</P>
<P>In the year 1741, it is recorded by Dr. Lind, in his 2d paper on infection, that the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced by means of a trunk of wearing apparel received from Barbadoes, which had belonged to a gentleman that died of the di&s;ea&s;e in that place; and that the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread from the family that received the trunk, into the town, and de&s;troyed above two hundred of the inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="033590_0214_0FF795B2E7B50618">A letter from Mr. Lardner, contains an account of its prevalence and mortality in 1747, and adds, that many who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s and families would permit them, fled from the city.</P>
<P>An account of its prevalence in 1762, has been pre|&s;erved in the notes of Dr. Redman, and by him com|municated to the College of Phy&s;icians. According to tho&s;e notes, the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced about the latter end of Augu&s;t, by a mariner, who arrived from the Havanna ill of it, and took lodgings near the New Market, below Pine-&s;treet. The fever that year made but little progre&s;s above Spruce-&s;treet, but was con|fined principally to the vicinity of the New Market, and the &s;treets we&s;t of it; &s;preading gradually from one family to another, till towards the end of September; from which time it gradually declined, and cea&s;ed entirely about the middle of October.</P>
<P>In 1793, the di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance the latter end of July, in three or four families about the &s;ame time, in Water-&s;treet, very near to a wharf where a French privateer called the Sans Culotte, with a prize &s;hip from Europe, and two &s;mall ve&s;&s;els from a port in Hi&s;paniola, lay; one of which landed &s;everal &s;ick pa&s;|&s;engers immediately upon her arrival, &s;ome of whom took lodgings at Richard Denny's, within a very &s;hort di&s;tance from, and directly oppo&s;ite to the wharf where they landed, The fir&s;t victims to the di&s;ea&s;e were two of Denny's lodgers, one of which was attended by Drs. Cathrall and Phy&s;ick. Dr. Hodge, pre&s;cribed mercurial purges for three of Mr. Le Maigre's &s;er|vants on the 2d of Augu&s;t, who&s;e hou&s;e was one of the neare&s;t to the infected ve&s;&s;els. For nearly two weeks the di&s;ea&s;e was confined to that neighbourhood, or to per&s;ons that had tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s, or that had communication with tho&s;e that were &s;ick in it. But as the circle of contagion enlarged, the di&s;ea&s;e rapidly &s;pread through almo&s;t every part of the city, and de|&s;troyed four thou&s;and and forty-eight per&s;ons before the 10th of November, by which time it entirely cea&s;ed, having gradually declined from the com|mencement of fro&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="033590_0215_0FF795B4986D2898">In 1797, the di&s;ea&s;e made its fir&s;t appearance the latter end of July, in the neighbourhood of Mr. Ru&s;|&s;el's wharf, a few paces below Pine-&s;treet, where three ve&s;&s;els lay; One of which had been in port all &s;um|mer, one called the Iris, arrived from Oporto with wine, and took her &s;tation at the wharf on the 21&s;t of July; and the other called the Arethu&s;a, from the Havanna, on the 24th. The la&s;t mentioned ve&s;&s;el had been employed in tran&s;porting &s;laves from Jamaica to the Havanna, the latter end of June. The carpenter and one of the mariners died with &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever on board, during her pa&s;&s;age, according to the depo&s;ition of Mr. St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">phen King&s;ton, and a letter from Mr. Fitch, two re&s;pectable merchants, who were pa&s;&s;engers on board of the Arethu&s;a to the Havanna.

<P>The pilot, James Mulford, was attacked with fever on board the Arethu&s;a in the night of the 23d. being the la&s;t of her quarentine near the Marine Ho&s;pital, and was taken to his lodgings immediately after his arrival in her at the city.

<P>On the 29th of July, the mate and cook of the brig Iris, the ve&s;&s;el from Oporto, which lay in contact with the Arethu&s;a, were attacked with fever: The ca&s;e of the cook, who vomited matter black as ink, and died on the 5th day, was communicated to the College of Phy&s;icians by Dr. Stewart who attended him. The mate's fever terminated favorably on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d day. Three more of the &s;ame crew were attacked with the fever, three days after the mate and cook and all re|covered, though one of them became very yellow. G.

Captain M'Cowan, who conducted the Arethu&s;a down to the Fort on the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, was attacked with the fever five days after, and was attended by me on board his own ve&s;&s;el at Queen-&s;treet wharf.</P>
<P>John Larcha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, who worked on board the Iris, and lived back of Mr. Smith's &s;tore near the &s;ame wharf, was attacked on the 3d of Augu&s;t, and in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame week, &s;everal other per&s;ons all in the &s;ame neighbourhood.</P>

(p. 2.) Not being &s;u&s;pected to be contagious by the phy&s;icians of Norfolk in 1795, its origin was not enquired into.

<P>Dr. Mon&s;on, in the account which he has given of the yellow fever, at New Haven (Con.) in 1794, &s;tates "that in June the inhabitants of that city, were alarmed at the number of &s;udden deaths, which had occurred from the 10th to the 20th of the month, and reque&s;ted the &s;elect|men to make enquiry into the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e.

<HEAD>De&s;cription of the Symptoms.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ymptom in per&s;ons of vigorous con&s;titu|tions, was generally an acute pain in the fore part of the head, and a burning &s;en&s;ation in the eyes. The&s;e &s;ymptoms were either accompanied with, or immediate|ly &s;ucceeded by a chilline&s;s, or &s;en&s;e of univer&s;al cold|ne&s;s, (but no &s;hivering) accompanied with the mo&s;t ex|cruciating pain in the back, knees and legs, hurried and confined re&s;piration, oppre&s;&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;tructure about the epiga&s;tric region. This chilline&s;s alternating with tran&s;ient flu&s;hes of heat, and with palene&s;s and redne&s;s of the face, with great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, &s;ometimes continued from one to &s;ix or eight hours, and in &s;ome ca&s;es longer, but in many ca&s;es the violent &s;en&s;e of heat came on in a few minutes without any mixture of cold. This fever was rarely preceded by the &s;en&s;e of debility,
<PB N="219" REF="033590_0221_0FF795C28EFEE1E8">
which almo&s;t invariably precedes intermitting and remit|ting fevers. The &s;tomach was frequently affected with &s;ickne&s;s and retchings to puke during the continuance of the chilline&s;s, but &s;eldom afterwards for the fir&s;t two days, excepting in tho&s;e ca&s;es in which the &s;tomach ap|peared to be affected with inflammation from the begin|ning, as was &s;ometimes ob&s;erved. When this was the ca&s;e, the &s;tomach always felt &s;ore and painful upon be|ing pre&s;&s;ed by the hand. The patient was al&s;o, always either co&s;tive, or affected with dy&s;entric &s;ymptoms ac|companied with a burning &s;en&s;ation in the bowels, till the di&s;ea&s;e came to a cri&s;is, or at lea&s;t till an evident remi&s;&s;ion took place. And when &s;tools were produced by art, they appeared white re&s;embling tho&s;e of per&s;ons with the jaundice, owing, as appears from various di&s;|&s;ections, to an ob&s;truction to the excretion of bile from an inflammatory affection of the ducts which lead from the liver to the duodenum.</P>
<P>Though in ca&s;es that terminated favourably, there was generally a diminution of the violence of the fever every morning, there was &s;eldom a remi&s;&s;ion before the third day, and in many ca&s;es not before the fifth. When a remi&s;&s;ion did take place, it was generally accompanied with a copious di&s;charge by the bowels deeply coloured with bile, and &s;oon after with a general per&s;piration or a copious &s;low of urine. In &s;ome ca&s;es a &s;olution of the di&s;ea&s;e was accompanied with, or preceded by a cho|lera.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e after the ce&s;&s;ation of the chilline&s;s, was generally quick and ten&s;e, and in &s;ome ca&s;es full and throbbing, e&s;pecially towards the middle of the after|noon, at which time the &s;urface of the body was al&s;o more inten&s;ely hot and dry, and the thir&s;t increa&s;ed. The tongue always white and moi&s;t for the two fir&s;t days, afterwards it varied in appearance, from a light, to a dark brown, &amp;c. The eyes were generally inflamed and watery at fir&s;t; this appearance increa&s;ed decrea&s;ed with the fever. In many ca&s;es either a coma, or a per|petual inclination to vomit accompanied with a pain at &s;tomach, intolerable anxiety, and frequent and deep &s;ighing came on at the end of the third or beginning of
<PB N="220" REF="033590_0222_0FF795C5211D18B8">
the fourth day, and &s;ometimes later; in the former ca&s;e the pul&s;e appeared to differ but little from a &s;tate of health, though &s;ometimes it was very low and &s;mall, &s;eldom &s;o &s;low and full as that which ari&s;es from com|pre&s;&s;ion of the brain. In this case, unle&s;s &s;peedy relief was obtained, the limbs became cold, and blood i&s;&s;ued in &s;treams from the no&s;trils, and often from the gums and inte&s;tines, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t dangerous ca&s;es, if comato&s;e &s;ymptoms did not &s;upervene an ince&s;&s;ant puking came on, and every thing was ca&s;t up the in&s;tant it reached the &s;tom|ach, and the patient con&s;tantly complained of a burning and painful heat in that organ. A yellowne&s;s of the eyes generally made its appearance immediately after the commencement of the puking, and if the puking continued with violent and ineffectual &s;trainings, the yellowne&s;s &s;peedily diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over the whole body. The pul&s;e under the&s;e circum&s;tances was always &s;mall and low, but generally chorded, ten&s;e, or hard. When the cau&s;e of this puking was not &s;peedily removed, a &s;phacelus of the &s;urface of the &s;tomach took place, as ap|pears from di&s;&s;ections, and a mixture was thrown up, at fir&s;t flaky and of the colour of coffee grounds, and after|wards of a blacker colour and thicker con&s;i&s;tence, re&s;em+bling a mixture of &s;oot and water. As &s;oon as the black matter began to come up, every &s;everi&s;h &s;ymptom in|&s;tantly &s;ub&s;ided, except a &s;light alienation of rea&s;on, and a want of recollection, and the patient believed him&s;elf to be perfectly well: a cadaverous coldne&s;s now pervaded the limbs, the fair became livid and bloated, and the patient &s;oon &s;unk into the arms of death.</P>
<P>When the di&s;ea&s;e terminated favourably, it was mo&s;tly on the 3d, 5th or 7th day. When the rever&s;e, it was on the 4th, 6th or 8th day. Convul&s;ions fre|quently clo&s;ed the &s;cene. Sub&s;ultus tendinum never occured, when the di&s;ea&s;e terminated within eight days.</P>
<P>In many per&s;ons the di&s;ea&s;e affected the nervous &s;y&s;|tem, more than the arterial; in the&s;e ca&s;es, the febrile &s;ymptoms &s;eldom run high, and the di&s;ea&s;e was longer protracted&mdash;longer in coming to a cri&s;is.&mdash;In &s;ome ca&s;es

<HEAD>Treatment.</HEAD>
<P>MY experience both in 1793 and 1797, convince me that blood-letting is not only beneficial to a certain ex|tent, but is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in every ca&s;e where the pain in the head is con&s;iderable, and the pul&s;e quick and ten&s;e, and the &s;kin hot; and al&s;o when the &s;tomach is affected with a painful burning &s;en&s;ation, or feels &s;ore upon pre&s;&s;ure, e&s;pecially if accompanied with pu|king, and pain upon taking any mild liquid into it. Whereas it invariably does injury in every ca&s;e where the pro&s;tration of &s;trength is great and &s;udden, the pul&s;e low, weak, and irregular, the limbs colder than in health, countenance &s;hrunk, pale, livid and dejected, accompanied with great oppre&s;&s;ion, weight and &s;tric|ture about the epiga&s;tric and hypochondric regions, quick, unea&s;y re&s;piration, with anxiety, re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, and frequent &s;ighing. In two ca&s;es a &s;econd bleeding &s;unk evidently the vital powers, and certainly did harm, as the mercurial powders al&s;o did in another ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In the year 1793, I certainly found bleeding bene|ficial in more than two thirds of the ca&s;es that I at|tended after the 20th of September, (and I frequently vi&s;ited more than a hundred in a day at that time) for the majority of the ca&s;es that year began, as well as the la&s;t year, with inflammatory &s;ymptoms; and it is well known to phy&s;icians and hi&s;torians, that bleeding is a &s;afe and often an u&s;eful remedy in every di&s;crip|tion of di&s;ea&s;e in which inflammatory &s;ymptoms pre|dominate, not excepting the plague, which appears to be merely a higher grade of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>It is the abu&s;e, the exce&s;s, or the mi&s;timed applica|tion of blood-letting, that &s;hould be rejected in the yellow fever, and not its judicious and moderate ap|plication.</P>

I however, by no means, approve of the practice of tho&s;e who bleed <HI>profu&s;ely</HI> and indi&s;criminately in all ca&s;es in a &s;ever that is frequently attended with great lo&s;s of &s;trength, de|jection of mind, and putrid tendency. But to con|demn bleeding, and withhold it in all ca&s;es indi&s;cri|minately, argues not only want of experience, ob&s;erva|tion, and of reflection, but of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>It is evident, however indirectly it may be marked by the &s;ymptoms, that an inflammatory affection very fre|quently exi&s;ts in &s;ome part more than another, fre|quently in the &s;tomach, peculiar, in this re&s;pect, that its tendency to terminate in gangrene, as appears from numerous di&s;&s;ections, is infinitely greater in this di&s;ea&s;e than in any other that has ever appeared in this coun|try. It is no le&s;s evident, that this &s;tage, when violent, is almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;ucceeded by a diathe&s;is, or &s;tate of a putre&s;cent nature, unle&s;s prevented by evacuating remedies early applied, and the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances, no man attentive to the &s;ugge&s;tions of rea&s;on, would venture to draw off a very large quantity of blood at the fir&s;t operation, le&s;t it &s;hould induce too &s;udden debility, and thereby prevent the vital powers from counteracting the putre&s;cent tendency of the di&s;ea&s;e; which is always the ca&s;e when the debility is great, as on the other hand, the premature u&s;e of c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rdials and &s;timulating medicines inevitably increa&s;e the tendency of the exi&s;ting inflammation, to terminate in gangrene.

climate; e&s;pecially as it a&s;&s;umes a variety of different a&s;pects according to the con&s;titution of the patient, and the treatment he receives, which occa&s;ions an embar|ra&s;&s;ment that nothing can remove, but a habit of nice di&s;cernment, a quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, which enables a phy&s;ician to perceive real analogies, and a correct judgment, which &s;ecures him from being mi&s;led by imaginary ones.</P>
<P>Dr. Chi&s;holm's method of u&s;ing mercury in the malignant fever when it appeared at Grenada in 1794, was, "to give ten grains to an adult as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble, after &s;eeing him, at every period, and under every circum&s;tance of the di&s;ea&s;e, this he a&s;&s;ures us, generally acted as an aperient in the degree required, about an hour or two after it was given.&mdash;At the end of three hours he repeated the &s;ame do&s;e without opium, if the fir&s;t had not purged more than twice. At the end of three hours more the &s;ame quantity was given, adding opium, or not, as the preceding do&s;es had acted. In this manner ten grs. were given every three hours, till the &s;alvary glands became affected, which generally happened in le&s;s than twenty-four hours from the com|mencement of the treatment. Signs of returning health immediately &s;ucceeded the appearance of &s;alivation, and returning health was remarkably rapid." (See his E&s;&s;ay, p. 272.)</P>
<P>With the few ca&s;es that I have ventured to adopt this treatment, it has not &s;ucceeded with the &s;ame certainty as the Di&s;coverer's a&s;&s;urances gave me rea&s;on to ex|pect&mdash;Yet in ca&s;es where the &s;ymptoms appear to be of a nervous kind early in the di&s;ea&s;e, in&s;tead of in|flammatory, and not accompanied with tho&s;e of a putre|&s;cent, or malignant appearance, perhaps it is prefer|able to any other, when given in &s;mall and repeated do&s;es; ob&s;erving always to re&s;train it from occa&s;ioning too copious evacuations, by the occa&s;ional addition of opium, or by employing it externally<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the debility is very great, or after the acce&s;&s;ion of black vomiting mercury makes no impre&s;&s;ion, as the lymphatics lo&s;e their power of ab&s;orption</NOTE>.

<P>"THAT your memoriali&s;ts, deeply affected with the calamities produced by the di&s;ea&s;e which has recently occurred among&s;t us, are impelled by a &s;en&s;e of duty to their fellow-citizens and them&s;elves, to inform you, that they con&s;ider the laws which were enacted for the pur|po&s;e of pre&s;erving this city from malignant contagious di&s;orders, are very imperfect.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject being of immen&s;e importance, they hope to be excu&s;ed for &s;tating their &s;entiments with re&s;pect to it at large.</P>
<P>They are of opinion that the di&s;ea&s;e which produced &s;o much mortality and di&s;tre&s;s in the year 1793, was imported into this city from the We&s;t Indies; and they
<PB N="225" REF="033590_0227_0FF795D0212DF520">
are confirmed in this &s;entiment, by the circum&s;tances attending the di&s;ea&s;e of this year, which they con&s;ider as of the &s;ame nature and derived from the &s;ame &s;ource.</P>
<P>Some of their mo&s;t important rea&s;ons for this opinion are as follow:&mdash;The di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion is e&s;&s;entially different from the fevers that occur in this climate, and which originate from dome&s;tic cau&s;es. This differ|ence particularly regards the general progre&s;s of the &s;ymptoms, and the mortality, as is evident upon a com|pari&s;on of its hi&s;tory with that of the ordinary di&s;ea&s;es of this city.</P>
<P>A di&s;ea&s;e which re&s;embles the fever of 1793 and of this year in many important points, has long been known in the We&s;t Indies, and tho&s;e parts of America &s;ituated between the tropics, and in &s;even or ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht different in|&s;tances, in which a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e has occurred in the United States, in the cour&s;e of this century, there is good rea&s;on to believe that it was derived from tho&s;e countries. In mo&s;t of the in&s;tances, the original hi&s;|tory of the di&s;ea&s;e contains the information that it was imported. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the infection can be traced to the imported clothing of per&s;ons who died in the We&s;t Indies. In mo&s;t of the ca&s;es where the importa|tion cannot be a&s;certained, the fir&s;t appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e has been, as in the other in&s;tances, in the neigh|bourhood of the &s;hipping, or among per&s;ons connected with ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances has attending the fever of this year are extremely in point; and the narrative which ac|companies this, will we tru&s;t, &s;atisfy you that it was imported.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion commenced invariably in our &s;eaports, while inland towns, equally expo&s;ed to the or|dinary cau&s;es of fever, have e&s;caped; and in the two la&s;t in&s;tances of its occurrence in Philadelphia, the &s;uburbs and the country adjacent, were more healthy than u&s;ual at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on; and at the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, all the parts of the city, excepting the &s;mall &s;paces to which it was confined, were remarkably healthy.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="033590_0228_0FF795D2AB23D6A8">It exi&s;ts in the We&s;t Indies, particularly in time of war, when great numbers of &s;trangers are to be found there; and reference to dates will &s;hew, that in mo&s;t of the in&s;tances of the occurrence of the di&s;ea&s;e in the United States, there has been war in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts are aware, that ca&s;es may be adduc|ed where the di&s;ea&s;e has occurred in per&s;ons who were not known to have been expo&s;ed to imported contagion; but &s;uch is the &s;ubtile nature of this power, that it often exi&s;ts un&s;u&s;pected; and &s;imilar difficulties occur re|&s;pecting the &s;mall pox, and other contagions, allowed by all to be of foreign origin. There al&s;o occur, although very rarely, &s;olitary ca&s;es of malignant re|mitting fevers, the &s;ymptoms of which re&s;emble &s;o much the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, that they are often &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame; but there is this e&s;&s;ential difference, that a malignant remittent fever has never been, to our know|ledge, contagious in this climate.</P>
<P>The difference of &s;entiment among phy&s;icians, now &s;o much regretted, re&s;embles that which almo&s;t always takes place, when the plague is introduced into any of the civilized parts of Europe, where it is not well known. The identity of the di&s;ea&s;e, its origin and its contagious nature, have been often the &s;ubject of controver&s;y. Some phy&s;icians have con&s;idered it as of dome&s;tic origin; but proper health-laws, &s;trictly enforced, have latterly pro|tected the commercial parts of Europe from its ravages.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, your memoriali&s;ts cannot but regard a proper law re&s;pecting the &s;ubject, as a matter of the greate&s;t importance, and although they are perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the imperfection of the &s;cience of medicine, yet from a conviction that phy&s;icians are the be&s;t informed, as well as the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ted in the &s;ubject, they approach you with that re|&s;pect which is due to your Legi&s;lative authority, and declare their belief, that the exi&s;ting health-laws of this commonwealth are not &s;uch as are be&s;t calculated to obtain the de&s;ired end, and that they ought to be improved.</P>
<P>Having lately communicated in writing to the go|vernor, their ideas re&s;pecting the be&s;t methods of pre|venting
<PB N="227" REF="033590_0229_0FF795D632681168">
the introduction of contagious di&s;ea&s;es, they beg leave to refer you to that communication. At the &s;ame time they tender your their profe&s;&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance in framing an efficient law for this purpo&s;e; and thus having performed their duty, they hold them&s;elves di&s;charged from all re&s;pon&s;ibility, on account of the evils which may ari&s;e from the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of the Legi&s;lative arrangements re&s;pecting this impor|tant &s;ubject.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>TO the above Memorial I &s;hall only add, that to be|lieve, the yellow fever which is as contagious and nearly as malignant as the pe&s;tilence in its wor&s;t form, "is only a higher grade of the remitting or bilious fever from mar&s;h or putrid vegetable effluvia," requires that credulity which never reflects; and to a&s;cribe the difference in the effects of the &s;ame cau&s;e, to a revo|lution in the con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere, is a doc|trine too unphilo&s;ophical and vi&s;ionary to be embraced by any but vi&s;ionary people; e&s;pecially, as no experi|ments have been made to prove that any &s;uch revolu|tion in the atmo&s;phere has taken place; the contrary of which appears to be the fact, from the di&s;ea&s;e being confined to cities and clo&s;e unventilated &s;ituations, in|&s;tead of mar&s;hy tracts, which are the only &s;ituations in which intermittents and remittents, ever become epi|demic.</P>
