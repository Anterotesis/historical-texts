<P>HOwever it po&s;&s;ibly may have been que&s;tioned and contro|verted by &s;ome, whether e|ver there &s;hould have been any Power and Government of man over man, had man per&s;i&s;ted in that primitive Integrity in which he was Crea|ted; yet &s;ince his woful Apo&s;ta&s;y and Fall from that Integrity, that there &s;hould be a

Government and Power of man over man, is indubitably the Appointment and Ordi|nance of God. The Mo&s;t High, who has E&s;tabli&s;ht his Throne in the Heavens and who&s;e Kingdom Ruleth over all Creatures, both in Heaven and in Earth; although he be under no nece&s;&s;ity of nature, or defect of Power (as Earthly Princes are, who cannot do all alone, but are under a nece&s;&s;ity to execute by inferiour hands) yet has he been plea&s;ed (from the good plea&s;ure of his will, the &s;uperabundance of his Goodne&s;s, and in favour and compa&s;&s;ion to the Children of men) to make u&s;e of In&s;truments, and to exert and put forth his power by men, put|ting the Sword into the Hands of Creatures of our own kind and likene&s;s. And indeed &s;uch is the immen&s;ity of his Perfections, that our frailty cannot bear his immediate conver&s;es; If God &s;hould &s;peak to us, and judge us (as when he promulgated the Law on Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>) in an immediate way, his appearance would certainly be a&s;toni&s;hing, the Judgment would be mo&s;t dreadful and terrible. (There being no man can &s;ee him and live) He has therefore, in his a|bundant goodne&s;s, as well as infinite wi&s;dom, appointed men (who are of our own make, and &s;ubject to the like pa&s;&s;ions and infirmi|ties with our &s;elves) to be our Rulers, that
<PB N="13" REF="000968_0013_0FAE39A06B86E608">
&s;o there might be a greater tryal of Obedi|ence and Subjection in tho&s;e who are to obey and be &s;ubject, and a greater ground of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion in tho&s;e who are to Rule and Govern. In this way of Government which God has been plea&s;ed to ordain (and which is &s;o convenient and adapted to our pre&s;ent condition and cir|cum&s;tances) it mu&s;t be acknowledged that the per&s;ons whom he either appoints or per|mits to execute the Office, are not all alike Qualified to promove and advance (which is the common end of Government) the publick Weal. Among tho&s;e who (in the Providence of God) are ve&s;ted with Au|thority of this kind, &s;ome are not &s;o capa|ble to hold the Reins of Civil Government for the publick advantage; we read of Childrens being Princes, and of Babes bear|ing Rule; and, <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unto thee O Land, when thy King is a Child.</HI> Among tho&s;e who are ve&s;ted with Authority of this nature, Others there are who are not &s;o faithful in Guiding of Affairs for the publick Good; who are &s;o far from following him, who was wont to &s;ay, <HI>Non mihi, &s;ed populo</HI>; that they think they never act &s;o wi&s;ely with tho&s;e whom they have the Rule and Government of, as when (with <HI>Pharaoh</HI>) they &s;et over them Task ma&s;ters to afflict them with burdens,

till they &s;igh by rea&s;on of the bondage; and their cry comes up unto God by rea&s;on of the bondage. But others there are, who are ve&s;ted with this kind of Authority, who look upon them&s;elves &s;et in high Station, not &s;o much for them&s;elves, as for the peo|ples &s;ake; and accordingly are men &s;eeking the Welfare of <HI>Gods I&s;rael</HI>; They &s;eem to be the accompli&s;hment of the Lords pro|mi&s;e to his people, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 49.23. <HI>Kings &s;hall be their Nur&s;ing Fathers, and Queens their Nur&s;ing Mothers.</HI> Such is the &s;incere affecti|on, and tender regard which they carry to|wards tho&s;e whom they have the Govern|ment of, that they are as careful in provi|ding for them, in protecting and defending of them, in dealing compa&s;&s;ionately &amp; ten|derly with them, and in extending comforts and con&s;olations to them, as Nur&s;es are with re&s;pect to their Children. It is &s;ometimes &s;uch a &s;mile of Divine Favour to a people, as that tho&s;e who are in place of Civil Rule, and have the Government of them, are &s;o wi&s;e and prudent in their whole deportment, &s;o ju&s;t and righteous in all their Admini|&s;trations, as is to univer&s;al &s;atisfaction: They are &s;o renown'd and famous both for abili|ty and integrity, that what&s;oever they do (as it is &s;aid of <HI>David,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.36.) <HI>plea&s;es all the people</HI>; and a &s;pecimen we have of

In this Station and Capacity which he &s;u&s;tained, he was great|ly affected and applauded: Re&s;pect and Ho|nour was paid him, not only from a few, or from tho&s;e only of Inferiour Quality, but univer&s;ally from per&s;ons of all Ranks &amp; Orders. When he went from his Dwell|ing through the Streets to the place of Judi|cature, he was ob&s;erv'd and reverenc'd both by old and young; and when he came to &s;it in Judgment, he was eyed and honoured not only by the Body of the people colle|ctively, but even by tho&s;e that were chief and highe&s;t in E&s;teem and Dignity. Such was the re&s;pect and honour that was paid him, and this not meerly becau&s;e of his Po|wer &amp; Greatne&s;s, becau&s;e he was the Great|e&s;t of all the men in the <HI>East, Chap.</HI> 1.3.
