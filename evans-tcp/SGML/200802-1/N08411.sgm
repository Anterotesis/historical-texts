<L>With dignity and &s;pendor fills his place,</L>
<L>Still watchful for the public good, with care</L>

<L>But &s;oon the &s;miling years their period run,</L>
<L>A gloomy aera now its cour&s;e begun:</L>
<L>Pale famine comes, with her malignant train,</L>
<L>Dries up the &s;prings, and taints the fertile plain:</L>
<L>The trees decay, each flow'r, and balmy plant,</L>
<L>Pine at their roots, and vital humour want:</L>
<L>No pearly moi&s;ture on the meadow lies,</L>
<L>To fan the air no gentle breezes ri&s;e.</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Hebrews</HI> return with their younge&s;t Brother into <HI>Egypt. Joseph</HI> treats them with great Kindne&s;s, and a &s;plendid Entertainment; but &s;till be conceals his Re|lation to them. At la&s;t they are di&s;mi&s;t with plentiful Supplies of Corn; but the Steward, as commanded by his Lord, &s;ecretly conveys a Silver Cup into <HI>Benjamin</HI>'s Sack. After they are gone out of the City, he pur&s;ues and charges them with the pretended Theft; and at la&s;t he finds it in <HI>Benjamin</HI>'s Sack. They return with great Con&s;ternation, when <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> di&s;covers him&s;elf to them.</P>
