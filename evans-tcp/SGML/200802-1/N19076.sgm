<BIBL>DEUTERONOMY IV. 5, 6.</BIBL>
<Q><P>Behold, I have taught you &s;tatutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye &s;hould do &s;o in the land whether ye go to po&s;|&s;e&s;s it.</P>
<P>Keep therefore, and do them; for this is your wi&s;|dom and your under&s;tanding in the &s;ight of the nations, which &s;hall hear all the&s;e &s;tatutes, and &s;ay, Surely this great nation is a wi&s;e and under|&s;tanding people.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE are not left in doubt, concerning the wi&s;dom and &s;alutary nature of that con&s;titution under which the Hebrews were placed, as it proceeded immediately from GOD; and, in reference to the particular circum&s;tan|ces of that people, was the re&s;ult of unerring perfection. It was a free con&s;titution, in which,
<PB N="6" REF="024820_0005_0FC965669857E730">
all the valuable rights of the community were mo&s;t happily &s;ecured. The public good, was the great object in view, and, the mo&s;t effectual care was taken to pre&s;erve the rights of indi|viduals. Proper rewards were promi&s;ed to the obedient, and righteous puni&s;hments allotted for the di&s;obedient. GOD de&s;igned, for &s;pecial rea&s;ons, that the &s;eed of Abraham, &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed in a peculiar manner from all o|ther nations; he therefore undertook the gov|ernment of them him&s;elf, in all matters re&s;pec|ting religion, civil policy, and that military e&s;|tabli&s;hment, which he &s;aw to be nece&s;&s;ary for their happine&s;s and defence. We find Mo&s;es, who received this con&s;titution from GOD, and delivered it to his people, frequently exhorting them, to maintain a &s;acred regard for this di|vine in&s;titution, and to pay a con&s;cientious obedience to all its laws: in doing of which, they might &s;ecure to them&s;elves national pro&s;|perity, and enjoy, the unfailing protection of Almighty GOD.</P>
<P>To deter them from di&s;obedience, he called up their attention to that &s;olemn &s;cene which opened to their view, when they &s;tood before the LORD their GOD in Horeb: when there were thunders, and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; &s;o that all the people that was in the camp trembled. And the LORD com|manded, &s;aying, <HI>gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they &s;hall live up|on the earth, and that they may teach their children.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="024820_0006_0FC9656CC2E6D028">
<HI>For the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD, <HI>is a con&s;uming fire, even a jealous</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>THE argument made u&s;e of in the text, to excite in that people, a &s;pirit of obedience to their con&s;titution and laws, was this, that it would rai&s;e their character in the &s;ight of the nations: who from thence would be led, to en|tertain a veneration for them, as a great nation, a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding people. This &s;acred pa&s;&s;age, in connection with the important oc|ca&s;ion, which hath called us to the hou&s;e of GOD, this morning, may direct our attention to the following enquiry.</P>
<P>IN what, doth the true wi&s;dom of a people, a civil community, con&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P>THE general an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, may not be difficult; it will no doubt, be readily admitted, that the highe&s;t wi&s;dom of a commu|nity of intelligent beings, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t, in pur|&s;uing that line of conduct, which &s;hall have the mo&s;t direct and &s;ure tendency to promote the be&s;t good of the whole, both in time, and eter|nity. What ever creatures, may conceive to be a good, either, through imperfection of un|der&s;tanding, or degeneracy of heart; yet, if that which they call good, is in&s;eparably con|nected with more pain than plea&s;ure, taking in the whole of their exi&s;tence; then it cannot with propriety be &s;tyled good, certainly not the be&s;t good, con&s;equently wi&s;dom will not choo&s;e it. The province of wi&s;dom, is, to di&s;|cover and elect the mo&s;t valuable objects; and, to adopt the be&s;t means to obtain them. The&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="024820_0007_0FC9656E19369700">
ob&s;ervations, apply with equal force, to indivi|duals, and communities; to all cla&s;&s;es of men, whether in the higher, or, lower walks of life. Communities, mo&s;t certainly, as well as indivi|duals, under the guidance of wi&s;dom, will pur|&s;ue that conduct which &s;hall be productive of their highe&s;t happine&s;s, in every period of their exi&s;tence. But the que&s;tion returns, what is that conduct, which &s;hall have the de&s;ired ten|dency, and will effect the highe&s;t good? This que&s;tion, as it re&s;pects mankind at large in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, might admit, a great variety of an&s;wers: &s;ome of which, may demand parti|cular notice on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. WISDOM will direct a community, to e&s;|tabli&s;h a good &s;y&s;tem of government. It may be a que&s;tion, whether the all wi&s;e GOD ever de|&s;igned, that any of his intelligent creatures, even in a &s;tate of perfection, &s;hould exi&s;t with|out &s;ome kind of government, and &s;ubordinati|on among&s;t them&s;elves. All creatures, have not the &s;ame capacities; neither are they pla|ced under equal advantages; and, if tho&s;e may be found, who&s;e capacities are equally exten|&s;ive, &s;till they are different; and &s;eem to be de&s;igned for different purpo&s;es, and &s;tations, in the great &s;y&s;tem. We read, of thrones, do|minions, principalities, and powers among&s;t the angelic ho&s;ts: which titles, denote various &s;tations among tho&s;e &s;inle&s;s beings, that they are differently employed, in degrees of &s;ubor|dination to each other, in the government of that holy family of which, GOD, is the father. But, however this may be, as our acquaintance with that world of glory, is very imperfect&mdash;
<PB N="9" REF="024820_0008_0FC9656F8D1574F0">
yet it is beyond a doubt, that government was de&s;igned, and is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for men on earth, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of degeneracy.</P>
<P>CREATURES, who have ri&s;en in rebellion, a|gain&s;t the holy and perfect government of JEHOVAH; have partial connections, &s;elfi&s;h in|tere&s;ts, pa&s;&s;ions and lu&s;ts, which often interfere with each other, and which, will not always be controlled by rea&s;on, and the mild influence of moral motives, however great: but the&s;e in their external expre&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t be under the re&s;traint of law, or there can be no peace, no &s;afety among men. Some kind of government, is therefore indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary for the hap|pine&s;s of mankind, that they may partake of the &s;ecurity, and other important ble&s;&s;ings re|&s;ulting from &s;ociety; which cannot be enjoyed in a &s;tate of nature. Without any con&s;idera|tion, of the various forms of government which have been adopted, in different ages and coun|tries; that, may be the be&s;t for a particular people, which in the view of all their circum|&s;tances, affords the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of promot|ing righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of &s;ecuring the mo&s;t va|luable privileges of the community, in its ad|mini&s;tration.</P>
<P>CIVIL liberty is one of the mo&s;t important ble&s;&s;ings which men po&s;&s;e&s;s of a temporal na|ture, the mo&s;t valuable inheritance on this &s;ide heaven. That con&s;titution may therefore be e&s;teemed the be&s;t, which doth mo&s;t effectually &s;ecure this trea&s;ure to a community. That liberty con&s;i&s;ts in freedom from re&s;traint, leav|ing

That happy con&s;titution enjoyed by the Hebrews, of which, the Supreme Law giver was the immediate author, was no other, than a &s;y&s;tem of good laws, and righte|ous &s;tatutes: which limited the powers and pre|rogatives of magi&s;trates, de&s;ignated the duties of &s;ubjects, and obliged each to that obedience to law, and exchange of &s;ervices, which ten|ded to mutual benefit.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. iv. 8.</NOTE> "And what nation is there &s;o great, that hath &s;tatutes and judgments &s;o righteous, as all this law which I &s;et before you this day."

The laws of a &s;tate, &s;hould equal|ly bind every member, whether his &s;tation be the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, or, the mo&s;t ob&s;cure. Rulers in a righteous government, are as really under the controul of law, as the meane&s;t &s;ub|ject: and the one equally with the other, &s;hould be &s;ubjected to puni&s;hment, when ever he be|comes criminal, by a violation of the law.

<P N="2">2. THE wi&s;dom of a people will appear, in their united exertions to &s;upport &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of government, in its regular admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>ENACTING &s;alutary laws, di&s;covers the wi&s;|dom and good de&s;ign of legi&s;lators: but the liberty and happine&s;s of the community, e&s;&s;en|tially depend upon their regular execution. The be&s;t code of laws can an&s;wer no good pur|po&s;es, any further than it is executed. Every member in &s;ociety is bound, in duty to the community, him&s;elf, and po&s;terity, to u&s;e his endeavours that the laws of the &s;tate be carried into execution.</P>
<P>LAWS, point out the exi&s;ting offices, relations and dependancies of the community: they &s;erve for the direction, &s;upport and defence of all characters; but con&s;idered as re&s;traints, they more e&s;pecially re&s;pect the unruly members.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. i. 9, 10.</NOTE> "Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obe|dient, for the ungodly and for &s;inners, for un|holy and profane, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers, for man&s;layers, for whoremongers, for them that defile them&s;elves with mankind, for liars, for perjured per&s;ons,
<PB N="12" REF="024820_0011_0FC9657A5BA08280">
and if there be any other thing that is contrary to &s;ound doctrine." It is unrea&s;onable to ex|pect, that the vices of man which are inimical to &s;ociety, will be re&s;trained by &s;ilent laws ex|i&s;ting upon paper: they mu&s;t be carried into ex|ecution, and be known to have an active exi&s;t|ence, that &s;uch as contemn the law, may not only read, but feel the re&s;entment of the community.</P>
<P>IT is not within the reach of human under|&s;tanding, to look with preci&s;ion into futurity, to di&s;cover all the circum&s;tances and contin|gencies which may take place among a people: neither is it certain, that every per&s;on who may po&s;&s;e&s;s a fair character for ability and integrity, and who may be called into public life, will be governed in all his actions, by public and di&s;in|tere&s;ted motives. Through nece&s;&s;ary imperfec|tion, or corrupt de&s;ign, &s;tatutes may be enacted, which may not prove &s;alutary in their execu|tion; but greatly prejudicial to the common good: hence ari&s;eth the nece&s;&s;ity of alterations and amendments, in all human &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>CHANGES however, &s;hould be few as po&s;&s;ible; for the &s;trength and reputation of government, doth not a little depend upon the uniformity and &s;tability ob&s;erved in its admini&s;tration. Laws while they remain &s;uch, ought to be executed, when found to be u&s;ele&s;s or hurtful, they may be repealed: to have laws in force and not ex|ecuted, or to ob&s;truct the natural cour&s;e of law in a free &s;tate, mu&s;t be dangerous; will have many hurtful tendencies, will greatly weaken government, and render all the intere&s;ts of the community in&s;ecure. Liberty, property and

life, are all precarious, in a &s;tate where laws cea&s;e in their execution. When known breach|es of law pa&s;s with impunity, and open tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors go unpuni&s;hed; when executive offi|cers grow remi&s;s in their duty, e&s;pecially, when they connive at di&s;obedience: all di&s;tinctions betwixt virtue and vice will vani&s;h, authority will &s;ink into di&s;repute, and government will be trampled in the du&s;t&mdash;for which rea&s;ons, with others that might be named, it mu&s;t be the wi&s;dom, the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of all characters in &s;ociety, to unite their exertions, for the &s;up|port of righteous laws, in their regular admin|i&s;tration. As it would be exceedingly unrea|&s;onable to expect, that any people, can ever re|alize the benefits of good government, under a weak, or a wicked admini&s;tration&mdash;in which, per&s;ons de&s;titute of abilities, or, of &s;table prin|ciples of righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s, fill the va|rious departments of the &s;tate. Hence,</P>
<P N="3">3. THE wi&s;dom of a people will appear in the election of good rulers.</P>
<P>THE peace and happine&s;s of communities, have a nece&s;&s;ary dependance, under GOD, up|on the character and conduct of tho&s;e who are called to the admini&s;tration of government. A bad con&s;titution, under the direction of wi&s;e and pious rulers, who have capacity to di&s;cern, di&s;po&s;ition and re&s;olution to pur&s;ue the public good, may become a ble&s;&s;ing; being made to &s;ub&s;erve many valuable purpo&s;es. But the be&s;t con&s;titution, committed to rulers of a con|trary de&s;cription, may be &s;ubverted; or &s;o abu&s;ed, as to become a cur&s;e: and be rendered
<PB N="14" REF="024820_0013_0FC9657E9EE8D780">
productive of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous con&s;equen|ces. The under&s;tanding, or folly, of a people in reference to their temporal intere&s;ts, is in nothing more con&s;picuous, than in the choice of civil rulers. In free &s;tates the body of elec|tors have it in their power to be governed well; if faithful to them&s;elves and the public, in rai&s;|ing tho&s;e to offices of tru&s;t and importance, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of abilities and have merited their confidence by former good &s;ervices.</P>
<P>KNOWLEDGE and fidelity, are qualifications indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to form the character of good magi&s;trates. No man, ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed na|tural or acquired abilities, too great for the di&s;charge of the duties con&s;tantly incumbent upon tho&s;e, who act as the repre&s;entatives of the Mo&s;t High GOD, in the government of their fellow creatures: multitudes however well di&s;|po&s;ed, are totally incapable of &s;uch tru&s;t. The intere&s;ts of &s;ociety are always important, they are many times involved in extreme difficulty, through the weakne&s;s of &s;ome, and the wick|edne&s;s of others; and there is need of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive knowledge, wi&s;dom and prudence, to direct the various oppo&s;ing intere&s;ts of in|dividuals into one channel, and guide them all to a &s;ingle object, the public good. Wo to that people, to whom GOD by his providence in judgment &s;hall &s;ay; "I will give children to be their princes, and babes &s;hall rule over them. And the people &s;hall be oppre&s;&s;ed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child &s;hall behave him&s;elf proudly again&s;t the antient, and the ba&s;e again&s;t the honourable.

Following the &s;alutary coun&s;el of the prince of Midian, they will pro|vide out of all the people, able men, &s;uch as fear GOD, men of truth, hating covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>FREE republicans, as ob&s;erved above, have it in their power to be governed well: but they are in the utmo&s;t danger through a wanton abu&s;e of this power. Actuated, by noble pub|lic &s;pirited motives, and a primary regard to real merit in their elections; they will have the heads of their tribes, as fathers to lead them in paths of &s;afety and peace: under the guid|ance of &s;uch rulers, who con&s;ider their &s;ubjects as brethren, and children, and all the intere&s;ts of the community as their own; a people can hardly fail of all that happine&s;s of which &s;oci|eties are capable in this degenerate &s;tate.</P>

4. WISDOM will lead a people to maintain a &s;acred regard to righteou&s;ne&s;s, in reference to the public, and individuals.</P>
<P>MORAL righteou&s;ne&s;s is one of tho&s;e &s;trong bonds by which all public &s;ocieties are &s;up|ported. Heathen nations ignorant of divine re|velation, and the particular duties and obliga|tions which are enlightened and inforced by the word and authority of GOD; have never|thele&s;s been &s;en&s;ible, of the great importance of moral righteou&s;ne&s;s. Greece and Rome, in the beginning of their greatne&s;s, before they &s;unk into effeminacy and corruption, were careful to encourage and maintain public and private ju&s;tice: they laboured to diffu&s;e prin|ciples of righteou&s;ne&s;s among all ranks of their citizens. Many of their writings on this &s;ub|ject, de&s;erve attention &s;o far as the ob&s;ervance of moral duties re&s;pect civil communities, and the well-being of mankind in the pre&s;ent world. As all civil communities have their foundation in compacts, by which individuals immerge out of a &s;tate of nature, and become one great whole, cemented together by voluntary en|gagements; covenanting with each other, to ob&s;erve &s;uch regulations, and perform &s;uch du|ties as may tend to mutual advantage: hence ari&s;eth the nece&s;&s;ity of righteou&s;ne&s;s, this being the ba&s;is on which all mu&s;t depend. When this fails, compacts will be di&s;regarded, men will loo&s;e a &s;en&s;e of their obligations to each other, in&s;tead of confidence and harmony, will be a &s;pirit of di&s;tru&s;t and fear, every man will be afraid of his neighbour; jealou&s;ies will &s;ub|&s;i&s;t betwixt rulers and &s;ubjects, the &s;trength of
<PB N="19" REF="024820_0018_0FC9658D956D5230">
the community will be lo&s;t in animo&s;ity and divi&s;ion, all ability for united exertion will be de&s;troyed, and, the bonds of &s;ociety being bro|ken it mu&s;t be di&s;&s;olved. It was long &s;ince ob&s;erved, by one of the greate&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of kings, and will for ever remain true; "That righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation: but &s;in is a re|proach to any people." The truth of this di|vine maxim doth not depend upon any arbitra|ry con&s;titution, or, po&s;itive &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment: but flows from the rea&s;on and nature of things.</P>
<P>THERE is in the con&s;titution of heaven, an e&s;tabli&s;hed connection, between the practice of righteou&s;ne&s;s and the happine&s;s of moral be|ings united in &s;ociety. Public faith, and pri|vate ju&s;tice, lay a foundation, for public &s;pir|it and vigorous exertion to re&s;t upon; in &s;uch a &s;tate, every one will receive a proper reward for his &s;ervice, let his &s;tation be what it may: and every delinquent, will realize &s;uch puni&s;h|ment, as his offence, or neglect of duty may de|&s;erve. In a fixed regular cour&s;e of communi|cative and di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, all may know before hand, what the reward of their conduct will be. What the apo&s;tle hath &s;aid concern|ing the natural body, and applied to the church of CHRIST: may with equal propriety and lit|tle variation, be applied to political &s;ocieties. The&s;e bodies are compo&s;ed of various members, the members have various offices, but all of them are nece&s;&s;ary, for the well being of the whole; there is &s;omething due from the body to every member, and from every member to the body: every part is to be regarded,
<PB N="20" REF="024820_0019_0FC9658F154A5910">
and righteou&s;ne&s;s maintained throughout the whole.</P>
<P>THE members of a well organized civil com|munity, under an equal and ju&s;t admini&s;tration, have no more rea&s;on to complain of the &s;ta|tion alloted to them in providence; than the members of the natural body, have of the place, by GOD a&s;&s;igned them in that. "The eye cannot &s;ay unto the head, I have no need of thee; nor a|gain the head to to the feet, I have no need of you. But that the members &s;hould have the &s;ame care one for another. And whether one member &s;uffer, all the members &s;uffer with it: or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it." No member of the natural body, of a civil community, or of GOD's moral kingdom, can be required to do more, than ob|&s;erve the proper duty of its own &s;tation: when this is performed, all is done which can rea&s;on|ably be demanded, it hath done well, and may expect the approbation and protection of the whole body.</P>
<P>MEN may indeed complain, becau&s;e they are not angels; and do it with as much propriety, as to feel di&s;contented, becau&s;e they are not all placed at the head of civil communities. The allwi&s;e GOD, hath given us our capacities, and fixed our &s;tations, and when righteou&s;ne&s;s is ob&s;erved by us, and the community of which we are members, we &s;hall then do, and receive, what belongs to us, and this is all we can rea|&s;onably de&s;ire.</P>

<P>THAT religion, which GOD hath enjoined upon rational beings, is not only nece&s;&s;ary for his glory, but e&s;&s;ential to their happine&s;s. To e&s;tabli&s;h a character as being truly religious, under the light of divine revelation, it is by no means &s;ufficient, that men &s;hould barely ac|knowledge the exi&s;tence and general provi|dence of one &s;upreme DEITY. From this hea|venly light, we obtain decided evidence, that the Almighty Father, hath &s;et his well beloved Son the ble&s;&s;ed IMMANUEL, as King upon his holy hill of Zion. This DIVINE per&s;on, in his mediatorial character, "is exalted, far above all principality, and power, and might, and do|minion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but al&s;o, in that which is to come. And all things are put under his feet. That at the name of JESUS, every knee &s;hould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s, that JE|SUS CHRIST is LORD, to the glory of GOD the Father."</P>
<P>IN vain, do guilty mortals wor&s;hip the great Jehovah, and pre&s;ent their &s;ervices before him, but, in the name, and for the &s;ake of this glori|ous Mediator. For it is his will "that all men &s;hould honor the Son, even as they honor the Father."</P>
<P>COMMUNITIES, have their exi&s;tence in, and from, this glorious per&s;onage. The kingdom is his, and he ruleth among the nations.

Through his bounty, and &s;pecial providence, it is, that a people enjoy the ine&s;timable liber|ties and numerous advantages of a well regula|ted civil &s;ociety: through his influence, they are in&s;pired with under&s;tanding to adopt, with &s;trength and public &s;pirit to maintain, a righ|teous con&s;titution: HE gives able impartial rul|ers, to guide in paths of virtue and peace; or &s;ets up over them the ba&s;e&s;t of men. By his in|vi&s;ible hand, &s;tates are pre&s;erved from internal convul&s;ions, and &s;hielded by his Almighty arm from external violence: or, through his provi|dential di&s;plea&s;ure, they are given as a prey to their own vices; or to the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of other &s;tates, to be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>THUS ab&s;olutely dependant, are temporal communities, and all human things, upon HIM who reigneth King in Zion. "Be wi&s;e now therefore, O ye kings; be in&s;tructed, ye judges of the earth.

The idea that there is, and ought to be, no connection between reli|gion and civil policy, appears to re&s;t upon this ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition; that men by entering into &s;ociety for mutual advantage, become quite a different cla&s;s of beings from what they were before, that they cea&s;e to be moral beings; and con&s;equently, loo&s;e their relation and obli|gations

In this light, you will e&s;teem it your highe&s;t glory, to manife&s;t a per&s;onal, &s;upreme regard, to the be|nevolent in&s;titutions of the Son of GOD: by the weight of your example, and the force of all that influence you po&s;&s;e&s;s, you will &s;tudy to commend his holy religion to all men; that you may be in&s;trumental, in promoting the temporal peace and eternal happine&s;s of this people. Public &s;entiments have a va&s;t influ|ence upon the conduct of mankind; public &s;en|timents receive their complexion from public men; the rulers of a people can do more than &s;ome may imagine, to promote real godline&s;s: if this, is recommended in their conver&s;a|tion, and exemplified in their lives, it will at|tract the attention of multitudes; it may lead &s;ome to a happy imitation, and will not fail, to give &s;trong &s;upport, to all the friends of GOD. But men, &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed at all times to ca&s;t off the fear of GOD, need &s;lender aid, from public influential characters, to become pro|fe&s;&s;ed

advocates, for infidelity and licentiou&s;|ne&s;s. How exceedingly intere&s;ting, gentlemen, to your&s;elves and the community, is the &s;tation a&s;|&s;igned you in providence? May unerring wi&s;|dom guide all your &s;teps, and the God of Abra|ham be your &s;hield, and exceeding great re|ward.</P>
<P>THE Mini&s;ters of GOD's &s;anctuary, will ac|cept &s;ome thoughts addre&s;&s;ed to them, not in|deed for their in&s;truction, but, to "&s;tir up their pure minds by way of remembrance."</P>
<P>REVEREND FATHERS and BRETHREN,</P>
<P>OUR character as chri&s;tians, obligeth us to be righteous before GOD, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamele&s;s: not forgetting that, of civil magi|&s;tracy, as one of the wi&s;e and gracious appoint|ments of heaven, which, rightly improved, will extend its happy influence beyond the pre&s;ent life. And, our office as mini&s;ters, calleth us to exhort all the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us, that they "&s;ubmit them&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake: unto kings and governors as unto them that are &s;ent by him for the pun|i&s;hment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well. For &s;o is the will of GOD, that with well doing ye may put to &s;ilence the igno|rance of fooli&s;h men." The ignorance and fol|ly of that principle, that there is no connection between religion and civil policy, is mo&s;t hap|pily refuted, when the followers of JESUS act in character, and demon&s;trate to the world, that real chri&s;tians are the be&s;t members of &s;ociety in every &s;tation. We are not then acting out

of character, when pointing out the advantages of a righteous government, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubjection to magi&s;trates. This however, is not the principal object of our mini&s;try: our wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding will eminently ap|pear, in converting &s;inners from the error of their ways&mdash;in winning &s;ouls to CHRIST. To effect which our &s;peech and our preaching mu&s;t not be with enticing words of man's wi&s;|dom, but in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and of power.</P>
<P>CONFIDING, in the unerring wi&s;dom, and boundle&s;s goodne&s;s, of GOD, we need not be a&s;hamed, nor afraid, to declare all his coun&s;el&mdash;being well a&s;&s;ured, that no doctrine, or duty, can be found in his revealed will, but &s;uch as are profitable for men to believe and practice. The great comprehen&s;ive de&s;ign of the chri&s;|tian mini&s;try, is the glory of GOD, in the &s;alva|tion of &s;inners, through JESUS CHRIST. In pur&s;uing this noble all important de&s;ign, we &s;hall labor to exhibit, the divine excellency of the chri&s;tian religion, in the holine&s;s of our lives and conver&s;ation, as well, as in the &s;implicity, and uncorruptne&s;s of our doctrines: that our example and our preaching, may unite in their tendency, to per&s;uade &s;inners, to become re|conciled to GOD. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings; that publi&s;heth peace, that &s;aith unto Zion, thy GOD reigneth!" and how is this beauty increa&s;ed? when the &s;piritual watchmen upon the walls of Zion, "&s;ing to|gether with the voice, and &s;ee eye to eye."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. lii. 7. 8.</NOTE></P>

THAT this beauty may appear and &s;hine, in all the mini&s;ters and churches of CHRIST; let us become more fervent, and united, in &s;up|plications, to our Father in Heaven, that he may &s;hed forth plentiful effu&s;ions of that &s;pirit of love, and of a &s;ound mind, which is the on|ly abiding principle of union, between moral beings. Under the influence of this holy &s;pi|rit, awakened to activity and renewed dili|gence, by the repeated in&s;tances of mortality, among the mini&s;tering &s;ervants of GOD, in the pa&s;t year; may we all pur&s;ue the &s;acred work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">gned us, with increa&s;ing joy, and &s;ucce&s;s, un|til called from our labors, to receive the free rewards of faithful &s;ervants, in the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>A brief addre&s;s, to the numerous audience pre&s;ent on this joyful anniver&s;ary, will clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>BRETHREN AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</P>
<P>LET us not vainly boa&s;t, in our truly happy con&s;titution&mdash;nor in the number of wi&s;e, and pious per&s;onages, whom GOD hath called to pre&s;ide in its admini&s;tration.

pains of damnation. Would we become a wi&s;e under&s;tanding people, we mu&s;t learn the &s;tatutes, and judgments, which the LORD our GOD, hath commanded, and obey them&mdash;we mu&s;t be a religious, holy people, "for without holine&s;s, no man &s;hall &s;ee the LORD." Let all be exhorted, to become wi&s;e to &s;alvation, through &s;aith, which is in CHRIST JESUS.&mdash;AMEN.</P>
