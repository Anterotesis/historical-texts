<Q><BIBL><HI>II. COR. XII. 14, 15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash; I will not be burden&s;ome to you; for I &s;eek not yours, but you: for the Children ought not to lay up for the Parents, but the Parents for the Children. And I will very gladly &s;pend, and be &s;pent for you &mdash;.</P></Q>

<P>_THESE are the Words (you are &s;en&s;ible) of ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Paul,</HI> the great Doctor of the Gentiles, &amp; as one calls him, the great Pat|tern of the Clergy. They breathe the true Spirit of a Mi|ni&s;ter of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; and are very agreeable, I hope, to the Di&s;po&s;itions &amp; Re&s;olutions of our dear <HI>Brother,</HI> who is this day to be &s;olemnly &s;epara|ted to the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel. As they are very fit to be his Ordination-Vow; &s;o I'm per&s;waded, they
<PB N="2" REF="002744_0003_0FE61FD40101C060">
enter into his Soul, and tell us the &s;ecret Language of his Heart: and truly glad &s;hou'd I have been, if (pur&s;uant to the Cu&s;tom, which hath &s;o long obtain'd among us) he cou'd have been prevail'd on to take up the Book at this time, &amp; preach to us his own de|vout Thoughts &amp; Purpo&s;es. Or otherwi&s;e, if he might ju&s;tly be excus'd upon the Plea's u&s;ually advanc'd in this ca&s;e, again&s;t the common Cu&s;tom,&mdash; Why cou'd not &s;ome venerable Father or elder Brother in this Neighbourhood, have taken the desk? Which, as it mu&s;t needs have been acceptable to the Audience, &s;o I'm &s;ure exceedingly more plea&s;ing to <HI>me,</HI> who am the unfitte&s;t among the Multitude of my Brethren, to &s;peak on &s;o great an Occa&s;ion, and to &s;uch an A&s;&s;em|bly. But &s;ince this part of the Day's work has been devolv'd upon me, I wou'd ask your ready &amp; grave Attention, while I endeavour, with all plainne&s;s of Speech and in the mo&s;t familiar &amp; u&s;eful manner I can, to repre&s;ent &amp; urge &s;ome of the Things which concern both Mini&s;ters &amp; People. Men &amp; Brethren, I pretend not to any new Doctrine, neither &s;tand here to inform or dictate: but bear with me, while I &s;tir up your Minds by way of Remembrance. For &s;o it becomes us to exhort &amp; admoni&s;h one another, e&s;pe|cially on the&s;e Solemnities; and not be negligent to put each other always in mind of the&s;e Things, al|tho' we know them, and are e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the pre|&s;ent Truth.</P>
<P>The words I've read to you, contain a rich Fund of u&s;eful &amp; &s;ea&s;onable Meditations. But &s;hou'd I at|tempt a ju&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;everal parts of the Text, I mu&s;t needs tran&s;gre&s;s the u&s;ual Limits, and take up abundantly too much of the Time, which on &s;uch a day particularly is very precious. If therefore
<PB N="3" REF="002744_0004_0FE61FDB7158EF40">
I wave the formality of dividing my Text, as well as pa&s;s over the Connection of the words, and but hint at &s;ome of the Reflections they afford, (that I may not be over tedious &amp; burden&s;ome) you'l ea&s;ily forgive me this wrong.</P>
<P>The Argument I have chiefly in view, and which &s;eems a genuine &amp; obvious Inference from the in&s;pi|red pa&s;&s;age before us, is this,&mdash;</P>
<Q>That <HI>Mini&s;ters are to be held a kind of</HI> FATHERS, <HI>in the Church of GOD.</HI> They &s;tand as in the Relation of <HI>Parents</HI> to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Families of God's People, and &s;hou'd &s;tudy to ex|pre&s;s a Fatherly Spirit in the whole of their &s;acred Mini&s;try.</Q>
<P>The Apo&s;tle hints the Relation, &amp; breathes the Spirit, in the words of our Text: and his con&s;tant Practice was full of bright &amp; in&s;tructive Comments upon it.</P>
<P>The Parental Relation is the <HI>&s;econd</HI> in human Na|ture; next to the Conjugal. 'Tis a &s;uperiour Rela|tion, and carries Authority with it: a near Relation, and be&s;peaks the tendere&s;t Love, the greate&s;t Care, and Complacence. It carries a peculiar Affection &amp; Endearment, to &s;weeten &amp; regulate the Authority and Power of it. And this may be the Rea&s;on why it is made a <HI>Pattern,</HI> &amp; every other Relation, in which there's Superiority, is in Scripture &s;et forth under the Parental Character. Hence the Supreme Lord of all is &s;tiled the <HI>Everla&s;ting Father</HI>; and when he would &s;et out his own boundle&s;s Love &amp; Pity to his People, He compares it to the Bowels of a <HI>Mother,</HI> and the Compa&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Father,</HI> as the mo&s;t lively and <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> Repre&s;entations. &mdash; Hence al&s;o <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> are called Fathers. In &s;everal Nations, the
<PB N="4" REF="002744_0005_0FE6203CB7CCF150">
Princes &amp; Governours have affected this Title, as the mo&s;t &s;plendid Badge of Honour. Among the Phi|li&s;tines, their Princes a&s;&s;um'd the appellative Name, <HI>Abimelech,</HI> i. e. My Father the King. The Roman Senators of old tho't it their brighte&s;t Character to be <HI>Patriae Patres,</HI> Fathers of their Country; and the Oratour con&s;tantly &s;alutes them with the Stile of <HI>Patres con&s;cripti. &mdash; Job,</HI> that godly Arabian Prince, glories in it, that he was a <HI>Father</HI> to his People. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> cry'd after <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Chariot, <HI>Abreck,</HI> i. e. (as many carry it) <HI>Tender Father</HI>! And in the Prophet, it is promi&s;ed the Church, that Kings &s;hould be <HI>Nur&s;ing Fathers,</HI> and Queens <HI>Nur&s;ing Mothers</HI> to her.&mdash;But then this is the &s;tyle of <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> as well as Magi&s;trates. There are Fathers in the Church, as well as the State. And indeed this Title of <HI>Fa|ther</HI> was in old time a very common Name for the Mini&s;ters of Religion. Hence <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> cry'd after the a&s;cending Prophet, <HI>My Father, my Father!</HI> &mdash; And He had this Re&s;pect repaid him by the King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who wept over the dying Prophet, &s;aying, <HI>O my Father, my Father!</HI> &mdash; And &s;ome good In|terpreters judge, that <HI>Solomon</HI> per&s;onates the <HI>Preacher,</HI> where he &s;ays, <HI>Hear, ye Children, the In&s;truction of a</HI> Father, <HI>and attend to know Under&s;tanding.</HI> A manner of Addre&s;s much like that &s;o often us'd by the Apo&s;tle <HI>John, &mdash; My little Children,</HI> the&s;e things write I un|to you, that you &s;in not: <HI>Little Children,</HI> let no man deceive you. He u&s;ed this Compellation, as being a Father to them by <HI>Office,</HI> as well as in Years. And to add no more, <HI>Micah</HI> invited the wandring young <HI>Levite</HI> to his Hou&s;e, in tho&s;e Terms, &mdash; <HI>Dwell with me, and be unto me a Father, and a Prie&s;t.</HI> And in the &s;ame Language was he afterwards invited away by
<PB N="5" REF="002744_0006_0FE61FDB78AAE988">
the Children of <HI>Dan,&mdash;Go with us, and be to us a Fa|ther, and a Prie&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to my De&s;ign, which mainly is to take a View of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter under this notion of a Spiritual <HI>Father</HI>: A Character, which though it be very naturally applicable to him, and is a Scripture-Title, and mu&s;t needs be equally plea&s;ant and pro|fitable to meditate upon, yet perhaps but &s;eldom has been allow'd its due Con&s;ideration. 'Tis not an emp|ty Title; but is full of Duty, full of Dignity, Sweet|ne&s;s and Charm. This external Character, when found in conjunction with tho&s;e intrin&s;ick Excellen|cies, Accompli&s;hments, &amp; Virtues, which corre&s;pond to it, gives us the mo&s;t Divine Idea of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter, &amp; makes him appear in his true&s;t Glory.</P>
<P>This Character, apply'd to Mini&s;ters, may import the following things more e&s;pecially</P>
<P N="1">1. It carries in it an Idea of <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Dignity,</HI> and &s;peaks the Eminence of their <HI>Station</HI> in the Hou&s;e of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. It hints to us the noble <HI>End</HI> of their In&s;titution; with the <HI>Importance</HI> and <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s</HI> of &s;uch an Order of Men.</P>
<P N="3">3. It points out the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of their Office.</P>
<P N="4">4. It &s;ugge&s;ts to us what their <HI>Qualifications</HI> and Accompli&s;hments &s;hould be.</P>
<P N="5">5 It tells us what <HI>Tempers</HI> and <HI>Deportments</HI> do become them.</P>
<P>Finally, It teaches us the <HI>Duty</HI> and Re&s;pect, which <HI>People</HI> owe to their Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;hort of the&s;e Things can be intended in this Character of <HI>Parents</HI> or <HI>Fathers</HI>; and all of them I think, are fairly included. They are comprehen|&s;ive
<PB N="6" REF="002744_0007_0FE61FDC85D35D10">
Heads of Di&s;cour&s;e: but I &s;hall endeavour to &s;um up what is to be &s;aid upon them, in as few words as is con&s;i&s;tent with my double De&s;ign, re&s;pect|ing Parents as well Natural, as Eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</P>
<P N="1">I. Then, <HI>Mini&s;ters may be call'd Parents or Fa|thers, in regard of their</HI> Station <HI>and</HI> Authority <HI>in the Church.</HI></P>
<P>The Pa&s;tor &s;tands as 'twere in the Father's place; a Po&s;t of Dignity and Power.</P>
<P>Every Father ordinarily has a Family and Hou&s;e|hold of his own: and all that belong to it are Sub|ordinate to Him, in their Dome&s;tic Capacity. He is the Head of the Hou&s;e, by the Law of Nature and Rea&s;on of Things. As the Head is the highe&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;picuous Part of the Body; is placed at the Top, has a governing Power ever all the re&s;t of the Members, &amp; is the Glory of the Man: So the Parents are the principal and mo&s;t eminent Members of the Family; but in &s;pecial, the Father. The Husband is the Head of the Wife: and be&s;ure then the Father is Head over the Children.</P>
<P>Man is by the Capacity and Propen&s;ity of his Na|ture, a &s;ociable Creature: well &s;tyl'd by the Philo&s;o|pher, <HI>A political Animal.</HI> We are form'd for mutual Fellow&s;hip and Commerce; without which many va|luable purpo&s;es of Life can't be &s;erv'd. 'Tis nece&s;|&s;ary to the political Well-being of Mankind, that they combine together in di&s;tinct Societies: and e|qually nece&s;&s;ary it is, that in every Society there be Government and Order. Now a Family is the fir&s;t Society in Nature; a kind of little Kingdom, where the Di&s;tinctions of Superior and Inferior, Governor and Governed take place, by an inevitable Nece&s;&s;i|ty,
<PB N="7" REF="002744_0008_0FE61FDC8CD7CBC8">
and the force of natural Light. Had Mankind continu'd in their original State of Innocence and Happine&s;s, it is highly probable there would have been a Di&s;tinction of Orders and Degrees among them. Doubtle&s;s at lea&s;t there had been di&s;tinct Fa|milies: and Nature has in the&s;e founded an immuta|ble Difference of Order, a Superiority &amp; Inferiority between the Parents and the Children. Levili&s;m here be&s;ure is contrary to the unalterable Rea&s;on of Things, and bids Defiance to the God of Nature. The Superiority and Power of Parents in their own Hou&s;es, is e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon the ju&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t in|violable Claims: and the careful pre&s;ervation of it makes much for the Harmony, Beauty and Strength of the&s;e little Bodies politick.</P>
<P>Now, when Mini&s;ters are call'd Parents or Fathers, it may intimate that their Station and Figure in the Church, carries a Shadow of this Paternal Eminence. JESUS CHRIST is Supreme Head of the Church: but He has deputed Mini&s;ters to pre&s;ide over parti|cular Flocks or Families of his People, as his Sub&s;titutes and Agents. We read, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.27, 28. Ye are the Body of Chri&s;t, and Members in particular: And GOD hath &s;et &s;ome in the Church, <HI>Teachers, &mdash; Helps, Governments.</HI> So <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.11. He gave&mdash; &s;ome <HI>Pa&s;tors and Teachers,</HI> &mdash; for the work of the Mini&s;try, till we all come, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash; The Church is compared to a <HI>Hou&s;ehold,</HI> (which is an orderly Society, implying a Variety of Members, in a State of Inequality and Subordination) and Mini&s;ters are placed therein as Fathers, to guide the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The many other exalted Titles and Names of Au|thority given them in the Scriptures, make this appear with a glaring Evidence. Thus they are
<PB N="8" REF="002744_0009_0FE61FE2A01A4AD0">
called <HI>Angels</HI>; partly no doubt with an eye to the di&s;tingui&s;hing Elevation and Authority of tho&s;e Heavenly Powers, as well as to their eminent Purity and Zeal. So, the <HI>Lights</HI> of the World; in allu&s;ion to the glorious Luminaries over our Heads; the Sun which was made to rule by Day, and the Moon and Stars, which were made to rule by Night. They are called <HI>Stars</HI>; becau&s;e they move in a Superiour Orb, as well as to "&s;ignify their diffu&s;ive Light and beneficial Influences" &mdash; They are called <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> of the Church, and are &s;aid to be <HI>over them</HI> in the Lord; to have the <HI>Rule over them.</HI> &mdash; Not for that they have <HI>Dominion</HI> over their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> but are helpers of their Joy: Neither as being <HI>Lords,</HI> to tyranni&s;e over GODs Heritage; but as <HI>Parents,</HI> who&s;e Yoke is naturally of all others the mo&s;t ea&s;y, and their Burden light. Yet neither do We pretend to &s;tretch the power of Mini&s;ters to the height of Parental Authority, or make it altogether of the &s;ame kind; but only a&s;cribe to them &s;ome faint Re&s;em|blance and lower Degrees. We mean not to a&s;&s;ume to our &s;elves a Civil or Temporal Superiority and Dominion: but only a&s;&s;ert our Station <HI>in the Church,</HI> and Right of Precedence and Rule in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, according to the Word of GOD, that unerr|ing Directory. We would make <HI>This</HI> our grand Rule, in the exerci&s;e of our Pa&s;toral Authority. And (I will add) &s;o far as we appprehend that celebrated Summary of Church-Di&s;cipline, commonly call'd the <HI>Platform,</HI> is grounded on the Scriptures, we hearti|ly concur with it, and de&s;ire to guide our &s;elves by it in our Pa&s;toral Care. Agreeable to this <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">f.</HI> Chap. X. Sect. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> we
<PB N="9" REF="002744_0010_0FE61FE2A71DC370">
claim a kind of Parental Power in the Church. &mdash; Yet we confe&s;s, our Authority is not Legi&s;lative, but Executive; not of a carnal, but &s;piritual Nature: not coercive, but &s;ua&s;ory and rational; not &s;olitary, but &s;ocial, to be exerci&s;ed (ordinarily at lea&s;t) in the pre&s;ence and with the Con&s;ent of the Church.</P>
<P>Neither do we pretend to exerci&s;e Pa&s;toral Govern|ment in any other than the <HI>particular Churches,</HI> which we are called to the over&s;ight of; even as the Heads of Families extend not their parental Power beyond the Limits of their particular Charges. &mdash; Nor do we &s;ubmit to any <HI>Foreign Juri&s;diction,</HI> in Affairs Spiritual and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical. We are for Com|munion of Pa&s;tors, &amp; Communion of Churches in all the Offices of Brotherly Love &amp; Neighborly Care and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, <Q>for their mutual Good and Edification, according to Capacity &amp; Opportunity.</Q> Our venera|ble <HI>Synods</HI> have very much inculcated the careful pre&s;erving of Church-Communion. Neverthele&s;s They hold that <Q>Every Church or particular Congregati|on of vi&s;ible Saints, in Go&s;pel-Order, hath full Power Eccle&s;ia&s;tical within it &s;elf, and is not un|der any other Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction what&s;o|ever. From whence they think it follows, that Con&s;ociation of Churches is not to <HI>hinder</HI> the ex|erci&s;e of this Power, but by Coun&s;el from the Word of GOD to direct and &s;trengthen the &s;ame upon all ju&s;t Occa&s;ions.</Q> Thus the Synod in 62. &mdash; So the Platform ob&s;erves, <Q>Churches [which im|plies the Pa&s;tors] are di&s;tinct, and therefore may not be confounded one with another: and <HI>Equal,</HI> and therefore have not Dominion one over an|other.</Q> &mdash; Indeed they look upon particular Churches to be as di&s;tinct, equal and independent, as
<PB N="10" REF="002744_0011_0FE61FE463B07980">
particular Families: and think <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Fathers</HI> agree in this, that as the&s;e in their Dome&s;tick Ca|pacity, &s;o tho&s;e in their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Character, have no Preheminence or Authority one over another. The Title of <HI>Father in God,</HI> they look upon as the com|mon and undi&s;tingui&s;h'd Character of every Bi&s;hop and Pa&s;tor; and the Divine Commi&s;&s;ion they act upon, as forever one and the &s;ame: which nece&s;&s;arily &s;ets them all on a Level, &s;uper&s;edes all pretences of an unequal Authority, and forbids any <HI>Strife among them which of them &s;hould be Chief.</HI> &mdash; Now, let the Sen&s;e of the Dignity and Authority of our Office, only &s;erve to in&s;pire us with a ju&s;t Solicitude, to &s;e|cure the Reverence due to our high Calling, by a &s;utable Conduct in it, and not expo&s;e it to the con|tempt of the Profane, by doing things unworthy of it. And let the only Contention among <HI>us</HI> of this Order be, <HI>who</HI> &s;hall make the fulle&s;t proof of his Mi|ni&s;try, and in the mo&s;t real &amp; noble Effects of Love, approve him&s;elf a Spiritual Father to his People. We &s;hould be more Studious to de&s;erve than to a&s;&s;ert the Honour due to our Sacred Calling; and &s;hould take Plea&s;ure (with the Apo&s;tle) even in Reproches and Nece&s;&s;ities for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. &mdash; I am become a Fool in glorying: Ye have compelled me. Where|fore, tho' I &s;hould boa&s;t &s;omewhat more of our Au|thority (which the Lord hath given us for Edifica|tion, and not for De&s;truction) I &s;hould not at all be a&s;ham'd.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>When Mini&s;ters are called Parents, it points us to the excellent</HI> End <HI>of their In&s;titution, and pro|claims the</HI> Importance <HI>and</HI> U&s;efulne&s;s <HI>of this Order of Men.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002744_0012_0FE61FE46C3CD828">This Character leads us to the noble De&s;ign of their being &s;et in the Church, which is, that they may &s;eek the Good of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> all their Days, and be &s;ingular Ble&s;&s;ings to their Generation. For &s;uch is the wi&s;e Parent in his Family, and to the World. Va&s;t are the Benefits, unknown the happy Fruits of Parental Care and Love, under a due Regulation, and accompany'd with the Divine Benediction. A Parent has peculiar Opportunities to &s;erve his Gene|ration, by training up his Children in Wi&s;dom and Virtue. Parents (as &s;uch) generally move in a Sphere very narrow; but yet of peculiar Importance to the Publick: and they often become diffu&s;ive Ble&s;|&s;ings, by the good Education of their Children, and di&s;creet Government of their private Charges. And both the Nature of their Relation, and the Intention of the GOD of Nature, render it nece&s;&s;ary, that Pa|rents &s;tudy in this way to do &s;ignal Service to the World.</P>
<P>Hence this Title of Parents, given to Mini&s;ters, carries us back to the Original De&s;ign of their Office, <HI>viz.</HI> the Good of Mankind, and more e&s;pecially of the People under their Charge. The Mini&s;try &s;urely was never in&s;tituted, merely that &s;ome Men might have the advantage to get a Living by it, or obtain a little Di&s;tinction and Power above others: But the primary Intention of it was, to be a Mini&s;try under Chri&s;t, to the good of Souls; that &s;uch as are of this Order, might approve them&s;elves <HI>Fathers</HI> to a Peo|ple, in all Offices of Love to their Souls; and by pro|moting Peace, Order, Virtue and Religion among them, become great Benefactors to the Publick. &mdash; This Style of Parents tells us what &s;hould be our main Inducement, in taking up this holy Calling;
<PB N="12" REF="002744_0013_0FE61FE6F6E26658">
and what the governing Aim of our Mini&s;try ought to be, in all the Acts and Exerci&s;es of it, whether re|ferring to Doctrine, Wor&s;hip, or Di&s;cipline. It tells us what Ble&s;&s;ings Mini&s;ters &s;hould Study to be, and what Ble&s;&s;ings all faithful and wi&s;e Mini&s;ters in fact are, to a People: as Lights, to guide them; as Pillars and Foundations, to &s;upport them; as Fountains, to refre&s;h them; as Shields, to defend them. Tho&s;e two Characters were very agreeably united in the Lamentation of <HI>Joa&s;h,</HI> over the Prophet on his Death bed, <HI>O my Father, my Father, the Chariots of I&s;rael, and the Hor&s;emen thereof.</HI>!&mdash; As to particular Families, much of their Beauty &amp; Safety is bound up in the wi&s;e &amp; good Fathers at the Head of them. Even &s;o learned and faithful Mini&s;ters are very much the Strength and Glory of a People. Hence the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, that the Office of a Bi&s;hop is a <HI>good Work,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.1.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>This Title of Parents, give to Mini&s;ters, very much points out the</HI> Nature <HI>and</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>of their Office.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis not an airy Title of Honour, this of Parents; but is big with &s;olid Duty, and implies abundant Bu&s;ine&s;s, Care, and Labour. You that are Parents, and have Families, are doubtle&s;s &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the daily Returns of Duty, Toil, &amp; Fatigue, in the Paren|tal Station, that you need not any Amplifications on this head, to illu&s;trate the matter to you.</P>
<P>Agreeably the work of the Mini&s;try is a great Work, and in &s;ome Places almo&s;t an immen&s;e La|bour. Whatever many may think of it, 'tis no Idle or Ea&s;y Profe&s;&s;ion; but full of Services, laborious, painful, &amp; continually revolving.

well as moral, being Men of like Pa&s;&s;ions with others; together with the perver&s;e Humours of many proud and ob&s;tinate Sinners they have to deal with; &amp; the various Temptations that attend this Employment, from Satan, the Fle&s;h, and World&mdash;. The&s;e Reflecti|ons con&s;pire (agreeably to this Character of Parents given Mini&s;ters) to proclaim the Difficulty of their Calling. And this Character may &s;erve to inform us very much in the Nature &amp; Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Office. Here let me &s;ay di&s;tinctly,</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mini&s;ters to endeavour the <HI>Regeneration</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of Sinners.</P>
<P>They may be called Fathers, as they are in&s;tru|mental to propagate the Divine Nature, &amp; promote the New Birth of Souls. 'Tis on this Account that the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;tiles him&s;elf a <HI>Father</HI> to the Chri&s;tians at <HI>Corinth,</HI> &amp; calls them his beloved <HI>Sons</HI>; for (&s;ays he) <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us I have begotten you through the Go&s;pel</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4 14, 15.</NOTE>. So he &s;ays to <HI>Philemon,</HI> I be&s;eech thee for my <HI>SON One&s;imus, whom I have begotten in my bonds.</HI> &mdash; Hence the Go&s;pel-Admini&s;tration is call'd <HI>the Regeneration</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 19.23.</NOTE>. We are all by Nature Children of Wrath, Children of the Devil, a Seed of evil Doers. But GOD in the Riches of his Grace, &s;eeking to him|&s;elf a godly Seed, &s;ent his only begotten Son into the World, that he &s;hould ta&s;te Death for every Man, and thereby recover us unto Life, Liberty &amp; Hap|pine&s;s. For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect thro Sufferings. And now it plea&s;eth GOD by the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching to &s;ave them that

believe. We preach Chri&s;t crucify'd; and are not a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; for it is the Power of GOD unto Salvation. 'Tis the grand means of begetting Souls to a &s;piritual Life. <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.18. Of his own Will <HI>begat</HI> He us, with the <HI>Word</HI> of Truth. So 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.23. Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the <HI>word of God.</HI> There is a kind of propagatory Virtue in the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which is apply'd by the Spirit of GOD for the production of a &s;piritual offspring. The Word doth not produce the new Creature merely by its own natural Efficacy; but by the concurring Opera|tion of Divine Grace on the Heart. 'Tis therefore called the Mini&s;try of the Spirit: &amp; we are &s;aid to be born of the Spirit; yet al&s;o to be born again by the Word, and Mini&s;ters are &s;aid to beget us through the Go&s;pel. &mdash; Hence then (in a remote and low and improper &s;en&s;e) the Character of Parents may be apply'd to Mini&s;ters, as they are In&s;truments in the Conver&s;ion of Sinners: and the Converts of Sion may in a &s;ubordinate &s;en&s;e be call'd their Sons &amp; Daugh|ters. <HI>"Aaron</HI>'s Sons (as one ob&s;erves) are call'd the Generations of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as well as <HI>Aaron</HI> (Numb. 3.1.) tho none of his natural Sons are there men|tioned &mdash; <HI>Aaron</HI>'s they were by natural Generation; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s perhaps by a &s;piritual Regeneration and In|&s;truction"</P>
<P>The Work of Mini&s;ters is to turn Sinners to GOD thro' the Go&s;pel; and thereby to rai&s;e up a &s;piritual Seed to Chri&s;t, their Elder Brother. &mdash; Not indeed that they can do this by any Principle or Power in them|&s;elves; nor may they attempt it in their own &s;olitary &s;trength, but mu&s;t have their ab&s;olute Dependence on Chri&s;t, who &s;aid even to his Apo&s;tles (tho&s;e emi|nent

Fathers of the Church) <HI>Without Me,</HI> Ye can do nothing. &mdash; In this matter of the New-Birth, verily a <HI>Paul</HI> is nothing; an <HI>Apollo</HI> is nothing; but all our Sufficiency is of GOD. 'Tis His &s;ole Prerogative to give the Increa&s;e. &mdash; Thus even as to natural Birth, this is not in the power of Mortals: but its GOD that frameth our Bodies in &s;ecret, and formeth the Spirit of Man within him. Hear what good <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;aid to his di&s;contented Wife, <HI>Gen.</HI> 30.2. <HI>Jacob's</HI> anger was kindled again&s;t <HI>Rachel,</HI> and he &s;aid, <Q>Am I in <HI>God's &s;tead,</HI> who hath with-held from thee the fruit of the Womb!</Q> &mdash; So afterwards when his Brother <HI>E&s;au</HI> met him and his Flocks, and &s;aid, Who are tho&s;e with thee? He an&s;wered, <Q>The Children which <HI>GOD</HI> hath graciou&s;ly given thy Servant.</Q> Parents are only the In&s;truments (in &s;ome &s;en&s;e) of their Children's being: their Formation is of GOD the prime Efficient. &mdash; So as to the Renovation of Souls, this likewi&s;e is from GOD. The Saints are his Workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Mini&s;ters are at be&s;t but mere In&s;truments in the hand of GOD. Yet <HI>being &s;uch,</HI> they may be called Parents, in regard of Tho&s;e who thro' their Mini&s;try are begotten and born to GOD. And to be Parents in this &s;en&s;e, is what they &s;hould continually a&s;pire after. 'Tis one eminent part of their &s;acred Employment to labour the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, that they may become the Children of GOD by Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us! and &s;o the Family of Chri&s;t be inlarged, by their being added to the Church.</P>

The&s;e are Duties taught us by the Light of natural Rea&s;on, &amp; enforced by the Laws of reveal'd Religion. And in the order of Nature it belongs to the Parents to lead in religi|ous Exerci&s;es. They who&s;e province it is to guide the Hou&s;e, &amp; pre&s;ide in the &s;ecular Affairs of it, &s;hou'd al&s;o go before the Family in the things of GOD. Every Ma&s;ter is as well a Prie&s;t to his hou&s;e, as a little King &amp; Prophet. The Father in old time, be|fore the In&s;titution of di&s;tinct Orders among Men, &s;u&s;tain'd this threefold character, &amp; offer'd Sacrifices, as well as bare Rule, &amp; taught within his own walls. And in Acts of natural Religion (&s;uch as Prayer) he &s;o far &s;till remains a Prie&s;t unto GOD, that he mu&s;t lead his family in the &s;piritual Sacrifices of Prayer &amp; Prai&s;e; which &s;hould, as the continual burnt offering, be pre&s;ented daily morning &amp; evening. We find the Patriarch <HI>Abraham,</HI> wherever he pitch'd his Tent, building an <HI>Altar</HI> (a Family-Altar) &amp; &s;erving at it, in his own per&s;on. We read al&s;o of <HI>Job</HI>'s &s;ancti|fying his Children, by burnt-offerings according to the number of them all. Thus (its &s;aid) did <HI>Job</HI> continually. &mdash; It is &s;poken of <HI>David,</HI> as what was

his Cu&s;tom, after the Tran&s;lation of the Ark, that he returned to <HI>ble&s;s his Hou&s;ehold.</HI> &mdash; And it is required of Ma&s;ters, as they would give to their Servants that which is ju&s;t &amp; equal, that (knowing they them&s;elves al&s;o have a Ma&s;ter in heaven) they <HI>continue in Pray|er, praying TOGETHER</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Col. 4.3. i. e. <GAP DESC="foreign"> &mdash; Compare 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 4 17. &amp; <HI>chap.</HI> 5.10. where the &s;ame word is tran&s;lated <HI>Together.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>In like manner, Churches being a kind of larger Hou&s;eholds, in which Mini&s;ters are &s;piritual Fathers, they are to ble&s;s the&s;e their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Families in the Name of the Lord; to pray for them in their Clo&s;ets, and to pray with them in private on &s;pecial occa&s;ions as they are called (&s;ee <HI>Jam.</HI> 5.14.) but more e&s;pe|cially in the publick Congregation. Of old the Lord &s;eparated the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> to &s;tand before him &amp; to <HI>ble&s;s in his Name.</HI> And this makes a part of the Office of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters al&s;o. Tho' we don't (that I at pre&s;ent remember) expre&s;sly read any where of the Apo&s;tles or fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel lead|ing in the prayers of any publick A&s;&s;embly: yet doubtle&s;s it was their Practice, &amp; &s;eems to be inti|mated in &s;everal places. &mdash; The Apo&s;tles do in&s;ert <HI>Benedictions,</HI> in their Letters to the Churches: and undoubtedly wherever they preach'd a Sermon, they pray'd with the A&s;&s;embly, &amp; pronounced a Ble&s;&s;ing on the Worthy. Even &s;o &s;hould every Mini&s;ter. They mu&s;t lead in the Devotions of GOD's Hou&s;e; &s;olemnly ble&s;s their People upon all proper Occa&s;i|ons, whether in publick or private, as well as make mention of them always in all their &s;ecret Prayers. They are oblig'd by their Office to give them&s;elves to <HI>Prayer,</HI> equally as to the Mini&s;try of the Word.
<PB N="26" REF="002744_0027_0FE61FFF0B6CA308">
And this is but what becomes the Character of <HI>Fathers,</HI> which they &s;u&s;tain. Thus the young <HI>Levite</HI> was a <HI>Father</HI> &amp; a <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> to the Tribe of <HI>Dan.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Mini&s;ters are oblig'd to be</HI> Examples <HI>of Religion before their People.</HI></P>
<P>Parents partake of the &s;ame Nature, which they propagate unto their Children: So Mini&s;ters &s;hould &s;ee to it that they them&s;elves be real In&s;tances of that viral Sanctity, which 'tis the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of their Office to promote &amp; &s;pread in the World.</P>
<P>The Example of Parents carries a peculiar Force and Impre&s;&s;ion with it; which Reflection &s;hould make them ever &s;olicitous to be exemplary in all their language &amp; demeanour before their Hou&s;ehould. And of the like Influence is the Example of Mini&s;ters. They therefore &s;hould &s;tudy to teach Religion by their Practice as well as Doctrine; that the former adding Weight &amp; Efficacy to the latter, &s;uch as have not been wrought on by their Word, may be won by their good Conver&s;ation in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It is not only a moral duty of common obligation on Mini&s;ters with other Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors; but &s;eems given them in charge even as a part of their &s;acred Office, and an in&s;tituted Medium for the car|rying on their Work to better advantage, That they be careful to &s;et a good Example; which is the mo&s;t Divine &amp; excellent, the mo&s;t familiar, compendious and engaging method of In&s;truction &mdash; Hence if Mini&s;ters &s;et a <HI>bad</HI> Example they are <HI>doubly</HI> guilty before GOD.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters are (as Parents in the Family) in a &s;omewhat <HI>elevated</HI> and <HI>con&s;picuous</HI> Station; they are as a City &s;et on a Hill, which can't be hid. They
<PB N="27" REF="002744_0028_0FE6204C6D630C90">
lie very open to Ob&s;ervation, &amp; many Eyes are up|on them. It is of no &s;mall Con&s;equence therefore, that they walk circum&s;pectly, &amp; be holy in all man|ner of Conver&s;ation; So, they will &s;hine as Lights in the World, &amp; diffu&s;e benign Beams &amp; Influences; will adorn their Doctrine, &amp; make Religion appear with an attractive beauty &amp; lu&s;tre. Whereas, on the contrary, if they are vicious &amp; di&s;&s;olute, their ill Example has a direct Tendency to &s;tain the honour of the Go&s;pel, to give a Reputation to Vice; to harden the Wicked, &amp; wound the Righteous Souls among their People. <Q>The wicked Lives of &s;uch will read loud Lectures of Athei&s;m &amp; Irreligion, &amp; &s;pread a deadly Infection, which wa&s;teth at noon-day: while yet in their publick Di&s;cour&s;es they may talk like Angels of light.</Q> If the Prie&s;ts make them&s;elves vile, the People will &s;oon come to abhor the Offerings of the Lord.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add here; Per&s;ons are &s;ometimes de|nominated the <HI>Children</HI> of others, from their <HI>Re&s;em|blance</HI> &amp; <HI>Imitation</HI> of them. For this rea&s;on in part are Believers called the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> becau&s;e they walk in his &s;teps: &amp; he is call'd the <HI>Father</HI> of us all, as being an eminent Example of Faith to all Generations.</P>
<P>Hence then, Mini&s;ters are oblig'd by this character of Fathers, to &s;hew them&s;elves <HI>Patterns</HI> of good works. It is therefore expre&s;sly required of them, in the Scriptures, &mdash; That they be <HI>blamele&s;s, and of good behaviour</HI>; Lovers of ho&s;pitality; Lovers of good men; &s;ober, ju&s;t, holy, temperate; not given to Wine; not greedy of filthy Lucre; no Brawlers, no Strikers, not &s;oon angry, not &s;elf-willed, neither carrying it as Lords, but being En&s;amples to the
<PB N="28" REF="002744_0029_0FE62003A7FB7558">
Flock: En&s;amples in Word, in Conver&s;ation, in Cha|rity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity: fleeing all youth|full Lu&s;ts; from which if a Man purge him&s;elf, he &s;hall be a Ve&s;&s;el unto honour, &s;anctify'd, &amp; meet for the Ma&s;ter's u&s;e, &amp; prepared unto every good work. In particular no &s;mall &s;tre&s;s is laid upon Mini&s;ters being Patterns for <HI>Family-Government</HI> &amp; Di&s;cipline: that they rule well their own Hou&s;es, having their Children in &s;ubjection with all gravity; for (&s;aith <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI>) if a Man know not how to rule his own hou&s;e, how &s;hall he take care of the Church of GOD?</P>
<P>The&s;e are Apo&s;tolick Canons, of a Divine Original, unque&s;tionably authentick; and do loudly be&s;peak entertainment with all that would approve them|&s;elves genuine Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, &amp; truly Fathers to their People.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> For all the&s;e ends, they mu&s;t <HI>per&s;onally re&s;ide</HI> among their People, as Parents dwell with their Children &amp; Family. The Apo&s;tle would have Mothers to love their Children, to be di&s;creet, keepers at home, guiding the Hou&s;e. And Fathers are oblig'd to re&s;ide as con&s;tantly with their Families as po&s;&s;ible. In allu&s;ion to this the names of Father &amp; Mother are &s;ometimes made u&s;e of to &s;ignify intimate Commu|nion &amp; Familiarity; as in <HI>Job</HI> 17.14 &amp; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.16. &mdash; 18. Even &s;o Mini&s;ters &s;hould live among their People, that they may get acquainted with them, and know the &s;tate of their Flocks, in &s;ome mea&s;ure as Parents know the &s;tate of their Families, &amp; have an intimate acquaintance with their Children. In populous places indeed, &amp; large Congregations, it is difficult to attain a per&s;onal knowlege of every In|dividual. Yet the ends of the Mini&s;try require that
<PB N="29" REF="002744_0030_0FE62003B087B0D8">
a Pa&s;tor be at lea&s;t acquainted with the general &s;tate of his People&punc; and he &s;hould &s;eek after a parti|cular Acquaintance, as far as he can, by careful in|quiries, by pa&s;toral Vi&s;its, by asking &amp; receiving Vi&s;its from them, &amp;c. that he may know their Soul-wants, &amp; be able to &s;uit his &s;piritual Provi&s;ions to their various Appetites &amp; Capacities. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t re&s;ide with their particular Charges; to the end they may watch for Souls; may in&s;pect the Con|ver&s;ations of their People; may &s;hine before them by the light of an holy Example, &amp;c. For the&s;e ends (I &s;ay) per&s;onal Re&s;idence is their duty; &amp; &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, as they wou'd approve them&s;elves worthy the Title of Fathers. It looks unnatural, &amp; a foul Incongruity in them, to be long or often needle&s;sly ab&s;ent from their Charges; much more to dwell &s;tately at a remote di&s;tance; or finally leave them but upon the mo&s;t ju&s;tifiable &amp; important Rea&s;ons. The Reprimand may be apply'd in &s;uch Ca&s;es, that was given the Prophet, when he was out of his place, <HI>What doe&s;t thou here,</HI> Elijah?</P>
<P>But thus much for the third thing, The nature and bu&s;ine&s;s of their Office. I come now to another general head.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>This title of Parents or Fathers, &s;ugge&s;ts to us &s;ome of the</HI> Qualifications, Gifts <HI>and</HI> Accompli&s;h|ments, <HI>that are requi&s;ite for the work of the Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>Men have &s;ometimes this Title apply'd to them, in regard to their Age, their Knowlege, their Wi&s;dom, Experience, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Seniority</HI> gives this Denomination. Hence the Apo&s;tle begins his Apology (Act. 22.1.) with tho&s;e di&s;tinct Compellations, <HI>Men, Brethren, and Fathers.</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="002744_0031_0FE6200C98FA60F0">
Now, in this application of the word, Some in the Mini&s;try are emphatically <HI>Fathers,</HI> &amp; have a di&s;tin|gui&s;hing right to the Name, by rea&s;on of their ven|erable Hoary Head. And tho' the&s;e are not the on|ly Per&s;ons intitled to that Character, &amp; tho' advan|ced Age is not requi&s;ite to the Mini&s;try; yet let me take occa&s;ion to &s;ay here, It &s;eems the highe&s;t Pro|priety, that Per&s;ons be able to write <HI>Man,</HI> and be arriv'd to years of Maturity &amp; Solidity, before they a&s;&s;ume this Office &amp; Character.</P>
<P>Under the <HI>Levitical</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, only <HI>middle-ag'd</HI> Men of the Tribe of Levi were employ'd in the Ser|vice of the Tabernacle. The Limits were from 30 years old to 50. &mdash; I &s;hall offer an Account of this matter, in the words of Mr <HI>Henry,</HI> (in his Expo&s;i|tion upon <HI>Numb.</HI> 4.) <Q>Of the other Tribes, tho&s;e that were number'd to go forth to <HI>War,</HI> were from 20 years old &amp; upward, but of the <HI>Levites</HI> only from 30 to 50: for the Service of GOD requires the be&s;t of our Strength, &amp; the Prime of our Time, which cannot be better &s;pent than to the Honour of Him, who is the Fir&s;t &amp; Be&s;t. And a Man may make a good Soldier much &s;ooner than a good Mini&s;ter. They were not to be employ'd till they were 30 years old, becau&s;e till then they were in danger of retaining &s;omething childi&s;h &amp; youth|ful, &amp; had not Gravity enough to do the Service, and wear the Honour of a <HI>Levite.</HI> At 25 years old they were enter'd as Probationers, <HI>Num.</HI> 8.24. and in <HI>David's</HI> time (when there was more work to be done) at 20. But they mu&s;t be 5 years learning, &amp; waiting, &amp; &s;o &s;itting them&s;elves for Service: nay in <HI>David</HI>'s time, they were 10 years <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> preparation, from 20 to 30. <HI>John Baptist</HI> be|gan

his publick Mini&s;try, &amp; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> his, at 30 years old. &mdash; It is not in the Letter of it obliging to Go&s;pel-Mini&s;tere now, as if they mu&s;t not begin their Work till 30 years old: but it gives us two good-Rules. (1) That Mini&s;ters mu&s;t not be <HI>Novices.</HI> 'Tis a work that requires Ripene&s;s of Judg|ment, &amp; great Stayedne&s;s; &amp; therefore tho&s;e are very unfit for it, who are yet but Babes in Know|lege, &amp; have not put away childi&s;h things. (2) That they mu&s;t <HI>learn</HI> before they <HI>teach, &s;erve</HI> be|fore they <HI>rule,</HI> &amp; mu&s;t fir&s;t be <HI>prov'd</HI>; then let them u&s;e the Office, being found blamele&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The Mini&s;try is an Office of Authority: &amp; natural Decency requires, that &s;uch as execute it, be Men both in years, &amp; parts. Be&s;ides otherwi&s;e there will be danger of two things: (1) of their being bloated with <HI>Self-Conceit,</HI> with young <HI>Nadab</HI> &amp; <HI>Abihu,</HI> to their Ruin. Hence the Apo&s;tle in&s;erts it in his Cha|racter of a Bi&s;hop. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Not a Novice</HI>; le&s;t being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condem|nation of the Devil. And then (2) there will be danger of their falling into <HI>Contempt,</HI> as being but of Ye&s;terday, &amp; knowing nothing.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try is a hard &amp; critical Work, &amp; of a &s;uperiour nature; &amp; &s;uch a work had need have a wi&s;e Head &amp; dextrous Hand to manage it. Verily it requires the be&s;t Furniture of Science, Prudence, Fortitude, &amp; Re&s;olution, to &s;upply all its occa&s;ions, and wade thro' its Difficulties. They hadn't need be very young, &amp; tender, &amp; unexperienc'd, that under|take &s;uch a Work; which will many times exerci&s;e all the Strength, Skill, &amp; Courage of a <HI>Paul,</HI> a <HI>Cephas</HI> and an <HI>Apollos</HI> united. Sure I am, the whole time of Youth is little enough to be &s;pent in preparatory
<PB N="32" REF="002744_0033_0FE6200DA8E7AA18">
Study, Prayer, &amp; Ob&s;ervation. &mdash; Let me pau&s;e here a little, and having fir&s;t laid my hand on my own brea&s;t, permit me to &s;ay, &mdash; Many of us have rea|&s;on to reflect with Shame upon our Ru&s;hing into the Pulpit &s;o young, &s;o undi&s;ciplin'd, &amp; unfurni&s;h'd: and all of us have too &s;ad occa&s;ion to lament our Igno|rance, Inexpertne&s;s, &amp; manifold Deficiencies.</P>
<P>I go on, &mdash;</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters had need be Men of good natural Powers; and the&s;e well cultivated by a liberal Education. It is requi&s;ite they be acquainted with the Tongues, Arts &amp; Sciences; &amp; have tho&s;e mea&s;ures of acquir'd Literature, which may advance them above the com|mon Level, &amp; di&s;tingui&s;h them from the Generality of their People, as much as Parents u&s;ually excell their Children in Knowlege. They had need be Men in Under&s;tanding; and e&s;pecially &s;hould they be mighty in the Scriptures; that they may be apt to teach, &amp; able both to exhort &amp; convince. El&s;e they little de&s;erve the name of Fathers. For &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, Every one that is unskilful in the Word, is a <HI>Babe.</HI> &mdash; They &s;hould be ready Scribes, well in&s;truct|ed to the Kingdom of GOD. They are call'd the Lights of the World. A Star without light, is not a greater &s;oleci&s;m than a Mini&s;ter without &s;ome good portion of Theological Learning.</P>
<P>Further, Another very important Requi&s;ite is Wi&s;dom. &mdash; <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.42. <HI>Who then is that faithful and wi&s;e Steward</HI> &mdash;! The&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Fathers had need be per&s;ons of Wi&s;dom as well as Fidelity: come to a virile Con&s;i&s;tence &amp; Perfection in their Rea&s;on and Judgment; having a ju&s;t Government of their Thoughts, Appetites, &amp; Pa&s;&s;ions; &amp; well ver&s;t in the Art of Bu&s;ine&s;s; knowing in Things as well

<P>Moreover, (it de&s;erves a &s;pecial Remark) the Mi|ni&s;try is a <HI>holy</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Work, &amp; therefore calls for <HI>gracious</HI> Qualifications; requires no little Strength in Grace, &amp; Experience in vital Chri&s;tianity.

<P>I pa&s;s now to another general Head.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>This title of Parents tells us what the</HI> Tem|pers <HI>and</HI> Deportments <HI>are which do become Mini&s;ters</HI>; that they &s;hould expre&s;s a <HI>Fatherly Spirit</HI> in their Mini&s;try, and imitate the Conduct of wi&s;e, tender, and religious Parents.</P>
<P>The <HI>Name</HI> in&s;crib'd upon them mu&s;t give Law to all their Powers, &amp; direct their Tempers &amp; Manage|ments; that as they are Parents by Office &amp; Title, they may be &s;uch by Analogy &amp; in Fact. Now a wide Pro&s;pect opens before me here; and might I be permitted to expatiate, a great deal cou'd be &s;aid to profitable purpo&s;e. But I &s;hall &s;tudy to bring my Thoughts into a narrow Compa&s;s; &amp; the rather be|cau&s;e I have &s;omewhat prevented my &s;elf, by many incidental Hints I've mingled in the foregoing part of this Di&s;cour&s;e. Yet I &s;hould hardly be ju&s;t to my Text, if I did not allow the head we are now upon, a di&s;tinct Con&s;ideration. Suffer me then to &s;ay here.</P>
<P>(1) Mini&s;ters &s;hould <HI>bear</HI> all &s;utable <HI>Parental Affections</HI> toward their People.</P>
<P>They &s;hould be Fathers to their People in Affecti|on. Love is the fir&s;t &amp; mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential pa&s;&s;ion in a Parent. Our Children being &s;o many parts of our &s;elves (without a figure) we love 'em by a natural and almo&s;t invincible In&s;tinct. And as it &s;eems a property of Love to de&s;cend with the greate&s;t force; &s;o the Love of Parents is perhaps of all others the &s;tronge&s;t, &amp; u&s;ually flows down in a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Tor|rent
<PB N="37" REF="002744_0038_0FE6204C74974990">
of Benevolence, Zeal &amp; Solicitude. Hence if Mini&s;ters would &s;hew them&s;elves in truth Fathers to their People, their Brea&s;ts mu&s;t be fill'd with Love, and flame with paternal Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t &s;ee to it that their Love be <HI>real</HI> &amp; un|feigned, as that of Parents; not a painted blaze, but a living Reality. For it's po&s;&s;ible there may be glittering Di&s;&s;emblers (like <HI>Judas</HI>) who have not the lea&s;t &s;park of &s;acred fire in their bo&s;oms; but their hearts cold &amp; dead as a Stone, while yet &s;ome|times all without may be flame &amp; heat.</P>
<P>Again, Their Love mu&s;t be <HI>pure,</HI> &amp; without the the mixture of corrupt Aims; a free &amp; generous Pa&s;|&s;ion, like that in Parents,; &amp; a &s;piritual Affection, kindled by motives of a heavenly extract, &amp; regulat|ed by Divine Principles &amp; De&s;igns. Not a general Philanthropy only, nor a Party-Friend&s;hip; not a mercenary &amp; &s;en&s;itive Affection; a mere human Love, terminating in carnal Con&s;iderations; &s;uch as theirs, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.17. <HI>They zealously affect you, but not well</HI>; that is, not &s;incerely, or upon true &amp; genuine Views. All worldly Con&s;iderations are heterogenous Springs. Where <HI>Self</HI> only or mainly is concerned &amp; intended, the Love is of a fal&s;e Original. We mu&s;t be animated by the &s;ame Spirit with the holy Apo&s;tle, who &s;ays in our Text, <HI>I &s;eek not yours but you: &amp; I will gladly &s;pend &amp; be &s;pent for your</HI> Souls <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">So it is in the Original.</NOTE> <HI>tho' more abun|dantly I love you, the le&s;s I be loved.</HI> &mdash; It mu&s;t be a Love to Souls, a Love to Chri&s;t in his People, &amp; a Love to them for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. This is to love the Brethren with a pure heart.</P>
<P>Again, Their Love mu&s;t be <HI>impartial&punc;</HI> as the love of parents generally is or &s;hould be. It mu&s;t extend
<PB N="38" REF="002744_0039_0FE6201585C81A40">
to all their People, without exception, &amp; without re|&s;pect of Per&s;ons. Indeed it can't be exerci&s;ed toward all exactly in the &s;ame manner &amp; degree without any di&s;tinction: this is neither po&s;&s;ible, nor a duty. Yet it mu&s;t be univer&s;al in its goodwill at lea&s;t, &amp; not limited by any &s;ini&s;ter Con&s;iderations. Suppo&s;e we have receiv'd Affronts &amp; Abu&s;es; or &s;uppo&s;e per&s;onal Defects in this &amp; the other; Deformity of Body, or (which is wor&s;e) a Crookedne&s;s of Temper; or Pover|ty, Meanne&s;s of Condition; or a prevailing Unpro|fitablene&s;s under our Mini&s;try, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet in none of the&s;e Ca&s;es is Love to be di&s;pens'd with. It is a dan|gerous thing for Mini&s;ters or Parents to want a hearty Affection to their Children or People, or to any of them. Corrupt Partiality has been the Bane &amp; Ruin of many Families &amp; Churches Unity &amp; Peace.</P>
<P>Again, Their Love mu&s;t he <HI>fervent,</HI> like that of tender Parents. We are to love our Neighbors as our &s;elves; &amp; yet are allow'd to love our Children in an uncommon degree. So Mini&s;ters &s;hould love all Men; but the People of their Charge, in a peculiar manner. Not contenting them&s;elves with &s;ome little faint &s;park of Affection, they &s;hould endeavour to get their Hearts in&s;pir'd with a burning Zeal, with Parental Ardours.</P>
<P>Moreover, It &s;hould be <HI>con&s;tant</HI> &amp; per&s;evering. The Love of Parents is a natural Affection: &amp; what's natural, is fix'd &amp; durable. So Mini&s;ters &s;hould have a kind of natural Affection for their People; an ha|bitual Love, an unperi&s;hing flame, which many wa|ters can't quench.</P>
<P>In fine, It mu&s;t be a very <HI>active</HI> Principle; reign|ing over all the Powers of their Souls&punc; &amp; producing all agreeable inward Motions, De&s;ires &amp; Re&s;entments.

What is it that a loving &amp; gracious Parent feels within? O the tender Sympathy &amp; Concern that fills his brea&s;t! The ardency of De&s;ire! The vigour of active Pity!

Child! Or can the Tenderne&s;s &amp; Vigilance of an affectionate Father be equal'd! He has his lov'd Chil|dren ever on his Mind, &amp; all his Powers upon the wing, to &s;eek their Good. And when natural Affect|ion is &s;anctify'd by the grace of GOD, all the Springs of pious Concern are open'd, &amp; he is &s;olicitous for their Souls, Day &amp; Night. Even thus &s;hould the Spiritual Parent bear his People upon his Heart, and grave them upon the palms of his Hands. Verily a <HI>carele&s;s Mini&s;ter</HI> is a prodigious Soleci&s;m. The Apo&s;tle tells Timothy, A Bi&s;hop mu&s;t be <HI>vigilant, &amp; take care</HI> of the Church of GOD. And he gives that Charge to the Bi&s;hops of Ephe&s;us, <HI>Take heed</HI> unto your &s;elves, and to all the <HI>Flock.</HI> &mdash; Watch &amp; remember that by the &s;pace of three years I cea&s;ed not to warn every one night &amp; day with Tears. &mdash; The Bi&s;hop or &s;pi|ritual Father mu&s;t watch in all things, as one that really has <HI>the Care of Souls,</HI> at heart. There mu&s;t be a Care to know the State of his Flock; a Care to find out proper Methods for the promoting their &s;piritual Safety &amp; Pro&s;perity; &amp; a Care to make a wi&s;e &amp; &s;ucce&s;sful Application of the Means: An earne&s;t Care (&s;uch as GOD put into the heart of <HI>Titus</HI> for the Church at Corinth) a Care to &s;erve Chri&s;t and &s;ave Souls; this, this is the true Pa&s;toral Care: &amp; mu&s;t be found in all that would approve them&s;elves in|deed &s;piritual Fathers to their People.</P>
<P>Thus we have been looking into the hidden Man of the Heart, &amp; viewing the inward Frames of Spi|rit, which agree to that &s;weet &amp; in&s;tructive Title of <HI>Parents,</HI> which Mini&s;ters are characterized by.</P>
<P>I go on now to &s;ay, &mdash;</P>
<P N="2">(2) They mu&s;t &s;tudy to illu&s;trate the Beauty and Propriety of their Name, by all &s;uitable Paren|tal

<HI>Conduct,</HI> &amp; outward Management, in their Office, and towards the People of their Charge.</P>
<P>Thus, they mu&s;t a&s;&s;ert their Character, by a <HI>dili|gent</HI> Di&s;charge of their Tru&s;t, in all the parts of it. Parental Love is a bui&s;y re&s;tle&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion. What is it that the affectionate Parent will not do for his Chil|dren! O the ardent Zeal that flows in his brea&s;t! The Vigour of Endeavour! The unweary'd Offices of Benignity! He'l gladly &s;it up late, &amp; ri&s;e early, to &s;erve them, &amp; think nothing in his power too much to do for 'em. &mdash; Now, even thus &s;hould Mini&s;ters be active &amp; diligent in their Work, to &s;hew before the Churches the proof of their Love, &amp; that their Care for 'em in the &s;ight of GOD may appear to them. They mu&s;t labour to do their whole work, the duty of the day in its day, according as every day requires. So far as the Mini&s;terial Tru&s;t is neglected, they put off the Character of Fathers. &mdash; True Parental Love will (in proportion to the degree of its &s;trength) put Life &amp; Activity into all their executive Powers, and make them ready to every good work; hating Sloth; impatient of Delays &amp; Hindrances, &amp; careful to redeem the Time. &mdash; And indeed their Work is &s;uch as calls for all their Vigour, Weight &amp; Applica|tion. They had need to &s;tudy hard, to read much, and think more, &amp; &s;tick clo&s;e to Bu&s;ine&s;s, the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Po&s;t; attending continually on this very thing; giving them&s;elves <HI>wholly</HI> to it, as was requir'd of <HI>Timothy.</HI> And &s;uffer me to &s;ay here, For this end, they &s;hould endeavour the greate&s;t <HI>Abstraction from the World,</HI> &amp; &s;it as loo&s;e to its con|cerns as may be. Indeed the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> (we know) &s;ome|times wrought with their <HI>own hands</HI>: but then it was only to &s;upply their pre&s;ent Wants, in a time of pre&s;|&s;ing
<PB N="43" REF="002744_0044_0FE62022A1C602E8">
nece&s;&s;ity; which perhaps is almo&s;t the only ca&s;e, wherein 'tis lawful for Mini&s;ters to employ them|&s;elves in worldly bu&s;ine&s;s; e&s;pecially to that degree as to take them off much from their divide Employ|ment. This is elegantly &amp; very ju&s;tly compar'd to a <HI>Warfare</HI>: And the Apo&s;tle remarks to his Son <HI>Ti|mothy</HI>; No Man that warreth, <HI>entangles him&s;elf with the Affairs of this Life,</HI> that he may plea&s;e his Cap|tain, that is, may be at lea&s;ure to attend, &amp; have skill &amp; will to execute his Orders, upon what&s;oever Service he plea&s;es to call him out. Now, to this end, it much more behoves the Mini&s;ter, to bani&s;h all en|&s;naring Earthly Cares and Anxieties out of his Mind, as much as po&s;&s;ible. Hence the Apo&s;tles renounced the <HI>Deacons</HI> Office (a Mini&s;tration about Temporals) That they might give them&s;elves <HI>continually</HI> to Pray|er, and the Mini&s;try of the Word: as finding by ex|perience they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in too great &amp; unrea|&s;onable a mea&s;ure <HI>leave the Word,</HI> if they continu'd to &s;erve Tables. (See, <HI>Act.</HI> 6.) &mdash; Few in the World are Men of that Capacity, Application, and Strength of Genius, as to be able to carry on a variety of Cal|lings together. The Mini&s;try before is ordinarily <HI>enough</HI> for any Man, to take up his whole Time, and exerci&s;e all his Powers. And then it being a <HI>&s;piritu|al</HI> Work, that calls for the mo&s;t heavenly &amp; divine Tempers, it &s;eems (in its nature) to be not a little incon&s;i&s;tent with the tumultuous Cares of a <HI>Secular</HI> or <HI>Civil</HI> Employment. There is danger of our drink|ing in a <HI>Demas-like</HI> Spirit, the Spirit of the World; if we needle&s;sly immer&s;e our &s;elves in the Affairs of this pre&s;ent life. Mini&s;ters being Men &s;ubject to like Pa&s;&s;ions had need as well as others to beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s; left the love of money, which is the

root of all Evil, once in&s;inuating it &s;elf into their brea&s;ts, this &s;hould gradually extingui&s;h every Spark of Love to Souls; &amp; &s;o the temporary Su&s;pen&s;ions of their Mini&s;try (in pur&s;uit of the World) unhappily lead to a final De&s;ertion of it; in Heart, if not in Practice. &mdash; But enough upon this particular.</P>
<P>Further, Mini&s;ters &s;hould endeavour to &s;hew them|&s;elves Fathers, &mdash; by the exerci&s;e of all fatherly and manly <HI>Gifts</HI> &amp; <HI>Powers</HI> in the performing of their Office.

And indeed as Love to Parents is a fir&s;t Principle deeply rooted in the Na|ture of Man; &s;o where any are truly begotten to GOD thr&ocirc; the Go&s;pel, they will by a kind of natural In&s;tinct value &amp; love their &s;piritual Fathers. Their Love to Chri&s;t, to his Hou&s;e &amp; Sabbath &amp; pretious In&s;tituti|ons, yea, &amp; to their own Souls, will powerfully con|&s;train them.

And truly if Love be a Debt to our natural Parents as under GOD the Authors &amp; Pre&s;ervers of our bodily &amp; temporal Life; we can owe no le&s;s to our &s;piritual Parents, who have begotten us by the Go&s;pel, to a better being, to a &s;piritual &amp; eternal Life.</P>
<P>Now, if Chri&s;tians wou'd &s;hew their Love; Then,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, Let 'em prize the Society of their Mini&s;ters. Love is a Social Pa&s;&s;ion. Be not &s;hy of your &s;piritual Fathers. Receive them in the Lord. So will they thank GOD, &amp; take Courage.</P>
<P>Again, Let People learn to value &amp; ask the Prayers and Ble&s;&s;ings of their &s;piritual Fathers. So <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> beg'd <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Ble&s;&s;ing: &amp; the &s;ame afterwards did King <HI>Joa&s;h</HI> of him. Even a profane <HI>E&s;au</HI> &s;ought his Father's Ble&s;&s;ing with Tears. People &s;hould be ready upon all Occa&s;ions to ask the Prayers of their Mini|&s;ters. In particular it is directed, Jam. 5.14. <HI>Is any &s;ick among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him.</HI> Truly Brethren, we look upon it as a Slight &amp; Coldne&s;&s; towards us, if you will not &s;end for us in &s;uch a Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Further, Shew your Love by a due Care not to grieve them by Contentions or other Scandals.

(1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.1.)</P>
<P>Moreover, Filial Love will teach you to follow their good Example. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.15, 16. In Chri&s;t Je&s;us I have <HI>begotten</HI> you thro' the Go&s;pel: <HI>Wherefore I be&s;eech you, be ye Followers of me.</HI></P>
<P>Again, True Love will teach People a due Confi|dence in their &s;piritual Fathers faithful Care &amp; Con|duct: and a Contentment with the whole&s;ome Food with which they entertain them in the Hou&s;e of GOD; altho' perhaps it be not dre&s;s'd up in all the forms &amp; &s;plendors that &s;ome others are treated with.

<P>Moreover, It will teach them to be con&s;tant &amp; af|fectionate in Prayer for them; generous in Requi|tals of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, love will teach People to mourn their Death, when GOD takes them from their head. The&s;e &s;piritual Fathers are mortal as well as other Parents. <HI>Your Fathers,</HI> where are they? and the Prophets do they live for ever? Chri&s;tians &s;hou'd often think of

this, while they are living; get all the Benefit they can by them, while they enjoy their Pre&s;ence &amp; Help; &amp; get prepar'd for the parting time: Honour 'em at their Death, by &s;uitable Lamentations; &amp; (may I not &s;ay?) al&s;o by a decent Burial. Even a mocking <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> cou'd join with his Brother <HI>I&s;aac</HI> in burying their Father <HI>Abraham.</HI> We read of <HI>Jehoiada</HI> the Prie&s;t, 2 Chro. 24.16. <HI>They buried him in the City of</HI> David, <HI>among the Kings, becau&s;e he had done Good in</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>both towards God, &amp; towards his Hou&s;e</HI> &mdash;.In a word, True Love will teach them to pay all becoming Re|&s;pects to their Memory. It is expre&s;ly requir'd, Heb. 13.7. <HI>Remember them which have &s;poken unto you the word of God.</HI> "It is ungrateful &amp; unkind (as one<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The late Rev. Mr. <HI>Stevens,</HI> in his Funeral Sermon for the Rev. Mr. <HI>Brattle</HI>; annex'd to his la&s;t Sermons.</NOTE> ob&s;erves) <Q>to forget <HI>any</HI> Friend or Benefactor: and much more &s;o, to forget our <HI>Fathers</HI> in the Church of GOD: &mdash;Their Names ought to be remember'd, &mdash; often &s;poke of, with Gratitude, Love &amp; Honour, for their Works &s;ake. The <HI>Children</HI> (at lea&s;t) of &s;uch &s;piritual Fathers &s;hou'd <HI>ri&s;e up &amp; call them Ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But I draw now to a Clo&s;e:</P>
<P>Let us reflect on the whole, &mdash; and then taking a View of our own Conduct, let us compare Things: &s;ee whether we have been acting up to our re&s;pec|tive Characters; the People, as Children, &amp; Mini|&s;ters as Parents. And may we be humble before GOD for all our Failings &amp; Mi&s;carriages towards each other! And let us all be concern'd to &s;tudy the exacte&s;t Conformity to our &s;everal Characters, in our Deportment towards each other, both Mini|&s;ters
<PB N="59" REF="002744_0060_0FE62051D2DE6DD8">
&amp; People, as Remembring that we mu&s;t give an Account unto GOD.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid might be apply'd, by way of Caution &amp; Direction to the Candidates for the Mi|ni&s;try &mdash; And al&s;o to the Churches, to regulate them in the great Affair of chu&s;ing a Mini&s;ter. Covet earne&s;tly the be&s;t Gifts: And yet I &s;hew unto you a <HI>more excellent way.</HI> Tho' one &s;peak with the Tongues of Men &amp; Angels, &amp; have not the Love of GOD in him, &amp; a Love to Souls (the Heart of a true &s;piritual Father) verily he is as a &s;ounding Bra&s;s, or a tink|ling Cymbal.</P>
<P>But now to conclude in a &s;hort Hint to You, Brethren, who are the Occa&s;ion of our Convening here at this Time. I need not apply my &s;elf parti|cularly to my <HI>Brother,</HI> who is this Day con&s;ecrating him&s;elf to the Mini&s;try. The Things which are pre|&s;ently to be given him in Charge by another &amp; the proper Hand, will be &s;ufficient. As he will give a hum|ble Entertainment to the Honours &amp; Re&s;pects, which I have been claiming for him in the name of Chri&s;t and from his holy Oracles; So I hope, a kind Recep|tion to the Words of Coun&s;il &amp; Admonition, that have been delivered. May He ever bear in mind this Character of a <HI>Spiritual Father!</HI> May he &s;tudy to be indeed &s;uch an one in the Church of GOD! And may he have a numerous &s;piritual Offspring for his Crown and Joy in the day of the Lord!</P>
<P>And I hope you, <HI>my Friends,</HI> who having built this Hou&s;e to the Name of GOD, have lately been incor|porated into a di&s;tinct Family (as 'twere) &amp; cho&s;en this Servant of GOD to be a Father unto you, will always remember the Character of <HI>Children,</HI> which the Apo&s;tle in our Text puts upon you, &amp; &s;tudy to
<PB N="60" REF="002744_0061_0FE620546DED2420">
adorn it by a becoming Reverence &amp; Love to Him. Receive him (as we tru&s;t you do this day) with all Gladne&s;s. See that he may be with you without Fear: for he worketh the Work of the Lord. Intreat him always as a Father: let no Man de&s;pi&s;e his Youth. The Pa&s;toral Power (accompany'd with a good Degree of Knowlege, Prudence, Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and Zeal for Souls) gives Age &amp; Seniority, to &s;uch as are but young in Years. Submit to him therefore as it is fit in the Lord. Do all you can to encourage his Heart, &amp; &s;trengthen his Hands in his Work. Be at Peace among your &s;elves. Strive together with him in Prayers to GOD for him. And let your Profiting by his Mini&s;try appear.</P>
<P>So will you make him a glad Father: and in the the great day he will give up his Account with Joy; will have Confidence before the Son of Man at his Appearing, &amp; &s;hall pre&s;ent you to GOD, in &s;uch Language as that, <HI>Lo! Here am I, and the Children which Thou ha&s;t given me!</HI></P>
