<HEAD>An affectionate and dying Father's la&s;t Words; with his &s;incere and godly Advice to his Children.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Children,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT appears to me, by the cleare&s;t demon&s;tra|tion, that I draw near, very near to the period of this mortal life. Divine Providence has been plea&s;ed to lay my feeble body on a langui&s;hing &s;ick bed. I believe, from various &s;ymptoms, that my di&s;ea&s;e is incurable, and con&s;equently mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue in death; and, to confirm this truth, I am given over by my phy&s;icians, and mu&s;t in all ap|pearance, in a very &s;hort time depart into the invi|&s;ible world of &s;pirits, and never ending eternity.</P>
<P>What a great and important change death makes on mankind. The body dies, and in a &s;hort time turns to putrefaction in the grave; but the &s;oul will &s;urvive through the countle&s;s ages of eternity. But, my dear children, this is my con&s;olation, and the foundation of all my hopes, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;in|ners, of whom I am chief, Tim. i. 15; and who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life. Therefore, re&s;pecting my|&s;elf, I am contented and happy. For, through the riches of divine grace, I can, with a&s;&s;urance, &s;ay, that when the earthly hou&s;e of this my tabernacle is di&s;&s;olved by the pale me&s;&s;enger Death, I have a building of God, an hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, 2 Cor. v. 1. Therefore, I &s;hall very &s;hortly in the words, and I humbly
<PB N="19" REF="022827_0019_0FBA6CB716B10178">
hope and pray in the faith, of ble&s;&s;ed Stephen, commit my &s;oul into the hands of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is ready to receive it, and bid an eternal farewel to all temporal things. But what troubles and concerns me, is you, my dear chil|dren; after my departure you will be poor help|le&s;s orphans, and my dear wife, and your kind indulgent mother, will be a di&s;con&s;olate widow. I leave you in a trouble&s;ome and wicked world, be&s;et with enemies on every &s;ide; but my trou|ble is mitigated and my hopes revived, through the gracious and comfortable promi&s;es of my covenant God, who commands me to leave my fatherle&s;s children "with him and he will pre|&s;erve them above alive, Jerem. xlix. 11. and my dear widow, by believing and tru&s;ting in the Lord, &s;hall want nothing that is truly good." They that tru&s;t in the Lord &s;hall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. Tru&s;t in the Lord, my dear children, with all your hearts, and lean not to your own under&s;tandings; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he &s;hall direct your paths. The Lord tells us by his prophet Jeremiah, that the way of man is not in him&s;elf; it is not in man that walketh to direct his &s;teps, Jer. x. 23. We have nothing to hope in but &s;overeign grace.</P>
<P>Give me leave, my dear children, to recom|mend to you, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, the read|ing and &s;tudying of the &s;acred and in&s;pired wri|tings, which our gracious heavenly Father hath given us to learn and know his will. Ble&s;&s;ed is he that readeth and they who hear the words of this prophecy, Rev. i. 3. and keeps tho&s;e things
<PB N="20" REF="022827_0020_0FBA6CB82A4CE350">
which are written in this divine book. Make the Bible your trea&s;ure, the promi&s;es your inheri|tance, and you will be happy here and for ever.</P>
<P>I al&s;o beg and reque&s;t, I pray and be&s;eech you, my dear children, with all the &s;ympathizing bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, and endearing entreaties of a loving and tender parent, that you will grant me this one reque&s;t, namely, to read my dying words through at lea&s;t once a month; it is my la&s;t will and te&s;tament, and I de&s;ire it as much as I do that you &s;hould enjoy my e&s;tate and tem|poral goods which I have given and bequeath|ed to you. I have been in&s;trumental, through God's ble&s;&s;ing, of your birth into this world; your &s;piritual nativity is out of my power, no|thing &s;hort of the omnipotent power of divine grace, can po&s;&s;ibly effect it: And this divine change mu&s;t pa&s;s, on your &s;ouls, my dear chil|dren, otherwi&s;e there can be no &s;alvation for you in the world to come, John iii. 5. Therefore, my earne&s;t cries, prayers, and petitions are fre|quently offered up to the God of heaven; and you, my dear children, mu&s;t not be wanting to addre&s;s the throne of grace your&s;elves, that God would pour his grace and &s;pirit upon your &s;ouls, and make you new creatures in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. "Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children, even &s;o is the Lord merciful unto them that fear him.&mdash;The merciful goodne&s;s of the Lord endu|reth for ever and ever upon them that fear him, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s upon children's children.&mdash;The Lord hath engraven his people on the palms of his hands, he keeps them as the apple of his eye, Deut. xxxii. 10. and waters them with his

grace every moment&mdash;For the mountains &s;hall depart and the hills be removed, but my kind|ne&s;s &s;hall not depart from thee; neither &s;hall the covenant of my peace be removed, faith the Lord that hath mercy on thee, I&s;aiah lxiv. 10." I am commanded in the &s;acred oracles of truth, to teach and in&s;truct my children in the good old way, that the holy fathers, prophets, and apo&s;tles have trod; and thro' grace, I have endeavoured, according to the ability given me of God, to di&s;|charge this weighty and important duty. I will further, my dear children, addre&s;s you in the words of the pious P&s;almi&s;t, to his beloved &s;on Solomon: And thou, know thou the God of thy father, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart, and with a wil|ling mind, for the Lord &s;earches all hearts and under&s;tandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou &s;eek him he will be found of thee, but if thou for&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t thee off for ever, 1 Chron. xxviii. 9. Hear, ye children, the in|&s;truction of a father, and attend to know under|&s;tanding, for I give ye good doctrine, for&s;ake ye not my law, Prov. iv. 1, 2. Call on the Lord and he will an&s;wer thee, and &s;hew thee great and mighty things which thou knowe&s;t not, Jer. xxxiii. 3. For the Lord hath promi&s;ed in his in|fallible word, that he will be found of you, when you &s;earch for him with your whole heart and &s;oul, Jerem. xxix. 13. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to &s;hew him&s;elf &s;trong in the behalf of them who&s;e heart is perfect towards him, 2 Chron. xvi. 9. For the Lord God is a &s;un and &s;hield, the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he

withhold from them that walk uprightly, P&s;al. lxxxiv. 11." The omnipotent Jehovah is a wall of fire about his cho&s;en people, and a munition of rocks to defend them from every enemy and every evil. Secure his favour by an evangelical faith in Chri&s;t, and you may bid defiance to every evil; you may laugh at all the wicked powers of earth and hell. The omnipotent Jehovah fills heaven and earth with his pre&s;ence, and always &s;urrounds us with his immen&s;ity, as the light and darkne&s;s doth our bodies, day and night, Jerem. xxxiii. 23. For in GOD we live, and move, and have our being, Acts xvii. 28. Therefore, my dear children, do you not behave in any manner, re|&s;pecting YOURSELVES, or others, which you would be a&s;hamed of before the meane&s;t of your fellow creatures. There is no creature that is not ma|nife&s;t in the &s;ight of God, Heb. iv. 13. Light and darkne&s;s are both alike to him, P&s;al. cxxxix. 12. His all-&s;eeing eye beholds every creature with one comprehen&s;ive glance, and no created &s;ub|&s;tance can &s;creen his all penetrating eye from be|holding it.&mdash;Be ye, therefore, &s;trong in the faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; becau&s;e abundance of grace, the &s;pecial gift of faith, will enable you to &s;tand complete and perfect in the whole will of God, John vi. 29. The glory of God and the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls, ought always to have the pre-eminence, becau&s;e it is the one thing need|ful. Happy is the man that findeth wi&s;dom, and the man that getteth under&s;tanding; for the mer|chandize of it is better than the merchandize of &s;ilver, and the gain thereof than fine gold: She is more precious than rubies, and all the things

You are very near my heart, my dear children, and I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly de|&s;ire your eternal felicity; but you mu&s;t remem|ber what the word of God &s;ays on this head, that without holine&s;s of heart and life, you can never &s;ee the face of God with comfort.

Probably not one of the human race in fifty thou&s;and lives to my age, which is about &s;eventy; and you, my dear children, though in the bloom of youth, and perfect health of body, may in&s;tantly cut down like a flower in its prime, as thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of mankind are; its is thought

Now, my dear wife and children, I mu&s;t leave you, therefore, I commit you to God and the word of his grace, who is able to build you up in the mo&s;t holy faith, and give you an inheritance among them that are &s;anctified.&mdash;Farewel my dear wife and children, farewel.</P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> My dear friend, at your reque&s;t I have drawn out the&s;e papers, and I pray God that they may have the de&s;ired effect on yours and others children's &s;ouls. You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, my friend, that if a man dies not having a wife, or, a woman not having a hu&s;band, the dimini&s;hing and adding a few words with the pen, will make the&s;e papers, I hope, in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;uit their purpo&s;es, re&s;pecting the age of the man, al&s;o the giving and bequeathing his e&s;tate, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And if a copy of this little <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> (which is what you intend, Sir), be written with the honoured parent's own hand, probably it will have a great|er tendency to incline the minds of the children to read it, and &s;trike their minds with awe and reverence, remind them of their duty to God, and the care of their own &s;ouls.</P>
<P>&oil; <HI>What you farther propo&s;e, Sir, &s;eems very con&s;i&s;tent, namely, to &s;ew the&s;e papers in at the end of your Bible, becau&s;e it will be a means to keep them clean, and pre&s;erve them from being lo&s;t.</HI></P>
