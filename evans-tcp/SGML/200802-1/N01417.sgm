<HEAD>A VINDICATION OF THE Bank of Credit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To <HI>John Burril,</HI> E&s;qr.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Attorney General, by his Letter of the Twenty Second of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t to your Self, as Speaker to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives for this Province, having mo&s;t unaccountably, with an uncommon Freedom, taken upon him to In|&s;ult and Arraign a Con&s;iderable Company of Gentlemen Merchants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (as he is plea&s;ed to &s;tile them) Projectors of the Bank of Cre|dit, and call them to the Bar of that Honoura|ble Hou&s;e, Charging them with the many <HI>High Crimes and Mi&s;demeanours</HI> following.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That they are openly carrying on their Bank with utmo&s;t Vigour and Expediti|on, in Contempt of an Order of Council; and indeed affirming, that the Government
<PB N="2" REF="001685_0003_0FB4D9492049EE20">
have nothing to do with them in that Affair: And that they look upon them&s;elves very Well and &s;ufficient to carry it on without ma|king any Application to the General A&s;&s;em|bly. <HI>Vide</HI> Page 3, 4.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That their Bank is <HI>Pandora's Box,</HI> Page 4.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That their Projection is ju&s;t Ripe for Execution, which will more or le&s;s affect, invalidate and break in upon the Prerogative of the Crown, &s;everal Acts of Parliament, the Con&s;titution and Laws of this Province, the E&s;tates and Liberties of the People; and that not only for the pre&s;ent, but &s;ucceeding Generations. <HI>Page</HI> 4, 7, 15.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That their Projection is a thing <HI>Intolerable, Unrea&s;onable and Unjust,</HI> not found|ed in <HI>Commutative Justice,</HI> and <HI>Common Hone&s;ty</HI>; and mu&s;t unavoidably prove a great Snare and Mi&s;chief to People that want Money to pay their Debts, or otherwi&s;e for who&s;e ea&s;e and advantage the Bank is Projected. <HI>Page</HI> 16, 17, 18.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Projectors is in one day to be Ma&s;ters of <HI>One Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> without any Ri&s;que, or any other Charge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Trouble, than the Writing and Signing a few pieces of Paper, to Accept <HI>Six Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Intere&s;t <HI>per Annum</HI>; whereby they would immediately have the profits of other Mens E&s;tates, and
<PB N="3" REF="001685_0004_0FB4D9750339AB18">
finally the E&s;tates them&s;elves, without a valu|able Con&s;ideration. <HI>Page</HI> 17, 18.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> That their Projection will be in ef|fect the &s;etting up an <HI>Ab&s;olute, Independent Government,</HI> which like a Fire in the Bowels, will Burn up and Con&s;ume the whole Body. <HI>Page</HI> 14.</P>
<P>The&s;e Articles being Intermixed and Cloath|ed with &s;o many Invective Sarca&s;ms, Oppro|brious Language and Undue Reflections, the Gentlemen Concerned hold them&s;elves Obli|ged in Ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, and the Truth, and in Honour to your &s;elf; that you and every one el&s;e may be Undeceived, and that the whole Matter may be &s;et in its true light, do Affirm and Declare,</P>
<P>That two or three Gentlemen in the Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> di&s;cour&s;ing of the Difficulties that Trade laboured under, for want of a Medium of Exchange, the Silver being &s;ent Home for <HI>England,</HI> and the Bills of Credit on the &s;eve|ral Provinces daily Called in by the Funds on which they were Emitted; thought it proper to con&s;ult &s;ome other Friends, and to Meet together, and Con&s;ider of a &s;uitable Remedy for the pre&s;ent and growing Inconveniencies and Difficulties. At which time &s;ome were de&s;ired to Commit their thoughts to Writing, in order to be con&s;idered of at a Second Meet|ing, which was accordingly done; And after &s;everal Meetings, agreed on a Land Security,
<PB N="4" REF="001685_0005_0FB4D98463B547F8">
as a Fund for Bills and Notes to be Circulated; and Minutes then drawn up, for the Regulating and Carrying on that Affair, but all with an intire dependance upon on the Government for their Favour and Countenance in promoting it, and furni&s;hing them with all &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Powers as might enable them to carry it on with &s;afety to them|&s;elves, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of their Bills or Notes. And therefore immediately they de|&s;ired &s;ome of the Gentlemen to wait upon His Excellency the Governour for his Advice, Favour, Countenance and Direction in their Projection; who accordingly the very next Morning before they had taken a fair Copy of their Minutes, waited on His Excellency; &s;o careful were they of paying all due Re&s;pects to Government, who were well Received by him, and Encouraged to proceed. And at the &s;ame time their Scheme being fir&s;t laid before his Excellency; his thoughts were de&s;ired, whether it was practicable for the Publick to come into a Fund them&s;elves, to which he was plea&s;ed to An&s;wer, No, by no means; The Country is greatly Indebted already, and if &s;uch a thing were propo&s;ed, any Landed Man might come into the General Court, and enter his Prote&s;t again&s;t it; Neither would it be &s;afe for that a Governours Fingers could not be kept out of it. And there then being fur|ther di&s;cour&s;e about the power of the Govern|ment
<PB N="5" REF="001685_0006_0FB4D989B61615A8">
to Lend at Intere&s;t on the Publick Cre|dit; He Replied, That what the Govern|ment could not do wi&s;ely, equitably and &s;afely they could not do; and that the Me|thod that they had Projected for Relief in that Affair, he well approved of; withal ad|ding, that he would be the fir&s;t Per&s;on that would take out <HI>Three Hundred Pounds</HI> of their Bills to promote their Credit, and en|couraged them to proceed to take Sub&s;crip|tions, in order to lay it before the General A&s;&s;embly for their Allowance; and that he would do all that lay in his power to pro|mote it; a&s;&s;uring them that he would Write Home in their favour, by &s;etting forth the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Projection: And direct|ed them to wait upon Mr. Secretary <HI>Ad|dington</HI> for his Advice, which they did, who was of Opinion that the Government would not Rai&s;e Money or Bills to Let out upon Loan. They then, and at &s;undry other times con&s;ulted him about their Scheme, committed it to him to peru&s;e, correct, al|ter, amend and frame as he &s;hould think fit, which he accordingly did. Whereas if the Projectors had been di&s;couraged in their &s;o early Attempts, it might have prevented a|ny further proceedings: And the &s;aid Scheme was laid before the General Court at their Se&s;&s;ions in <HI>February</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, together with a Petition, Sub&s;cribed by mo&s;t of the Underta|kers
<PB N="6" REF="001685_0007_0FB4D98E30A94E50">
of that Affair, for the granting them &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Powers, as they &s;hould think meet to carry on the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI></P>
<P>The foregoing being Matter of Fact, and the exact &s;teps taken by the Gentlemen con|cerned in the Projection of the Bank. It cannot be &s;o much as imagined, that the Au|thor of the Letter, his Po&s;t and near Relation to the Governour Con&s;idered, &s;hould be igno|rant thereof. However it fully proves that part of his Letter re&s;pecting their <HI>Slight, Neg|lect and Contempt of the Authority and Govern|ment</HI> to be a de&s;igned Mi&s;repre&s;entation, and therefore Abu&s;ive of the Gentlemen concern|ed; &s;ome of whom on &s;everal accounts are Superiour to him.</P>
<P>Now Sir, If you will plea&s;e to Con&s;ider his Argument, whereby he would &s;eem and pre|tend to prove his Charge of <HI>Contempt,</HI> &amp;c. you will find it as Unfair and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> his <HI>Charge,</HI> which is that which you mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have &s;een <Q>in the Publick News-Paper, or an Order of the Governour and Council pa&s;&s;ed upon the Occa&s;ion of the Projection of the Bank of Credit; whereby the Projectors were directed to proceed no further to that Affair, until the next Se&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly; that &s;o the whole Government might be of Advice in a Matter of that Weight and Con&s;equence. Notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="7" REF="001685_0008_0FB4D996561580E0">
all which, I am loth to &s;ay, in Contempt of it, the per&s;ons concerned are openly carrying on their Bank with utmo&s;t Vigour and Ex|pedition, and &s;uppo&s;ing, and indeed affirming that the Government have nothing to do with them in that Affair.</Q></P>
<P>Is not this a bold and wilful Mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion of the Matter? Whenas the Order of Council, which the Government Ordered to be Printed in the Weekly News-Letter, is in the Words following.</P>
<P>At a Council Held at the Council-Chamber in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> upon Fryday the Twentieth of <HI>August,</HI> 1714.</P>
<P><HI>Upon Reading a Memorial, Pre&s;ented by the Queens Attorney General, &s;etting forth that upon good Information, a certain Number of Gen|tlemen, and Merchants are Projecting a Bank of Credit as they call it, de&s;igning &s;peedily to Make and Emit a quantity of Bills to a great Value; which is a Matter of Importance, and will nece&s;|&s;arily be of General Influence.</HI></P>
<P>Ordered, <HI>That the Projectors or Undertakers of any &s;uch Bank do not proceed to Print the &s;aid Scheme, or put the &s;ame on Publick Re|cord, Make or Emit any of their Notes or Bills, until they have laid their Propo&s;als before the General A&s;&s;embly of this Her Majesties Province; who are always ready to Countenance
<PB N="8" REF="001685_0009_0FB4D99B457B9C38">
and Encourage any Propo&s;als that may be of be|nefit and advantage for the Publick; or for the promoting and encouraging of Trade amongst Her Majesties Good Subjects of this Province; And that this Order be Printed in the Weekly News-Letter.</HI> <BIBL>I&s;aac Addington, <HI>Secr.</HI></BIBL></P>
<P>Now by what Words in this Order can Mr. Attorney &s;upport his Argument, to prove the Projectors <HI>Contempt and In&s;inuated Di&s;obedience,</HI> which as it did not forbid their proceeding a|ny further in that Affair, but rather encourage and direct them to compleat their Sub&s;cripti|ons, and perfect their Scheme, &s;o as it might be fit to lay before the General A&s;&s;embly; &s;o was it punctually complied with, in that the Projectors neither Printed their Scheme, or put the &s;ame upon Publick Record, Made, or Emitted any of their Notes or Bills; but Re|con&s;idered and New-Modelled their Scheme, and took many more Sub&s;criptions, and &s;o far perfected it, as to lay it before the General A&s;&s;embly, which they did at their la&s;t <HI>October</HI> Se&s;&s;ions; hoping for their Countenance and Authority, for that becau&s;e a certain number of the Gentlemen concerned were appointed to attend his Excellency with the pre&s;ent Scheme, which they carried to him on the Morning of the Day they pre&s;ented another of the &s;ame to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, who then freely declared, that he would fa|vour
<PB N="9" REF="001685_0010_0FB4D99F0703EDD0">
the De&s;ign, if the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives and Council would come into it, and that the Publicks Rai&s;ing of Bills to Let out, to him had its dark &s;ides; for that if any Per|&s;on &s;hould borrow of the Publick Bills, and Mortgage his E&s;tate for payment, and fail of making payment, whereby the E&s;tate &s;o Mort|gaged &s;hould become forfeit, the E&s;tate &s;o forfeited would belong to the Crown; and if he were their Governour, he &s;hould think him&s;elf obliged to lay his Hands upon it, till the Kings Plea&s;ure could be had, who would have the intire di&s;po&s;ition thereof.</P>
<P>And now after &s;o fair a Glo&s;s and fal&s;e Comment upon the Order of the Governour and Council, and the Actions of the Project|ors in Conformity thereto in the very begin|ning of the Letter; what can be expected but the like Arguments throughout. And indeed here you may &s;ee <HI>Ex Ungue Leonem.</HI> Is not this too much like prevaricating talk in a bad Cau&s;e. Wherefore it is now to be Noted, that notwith&s;tanding the Gentlemen concern|ed, had made &s;everal Alterations in their Pro|jection&punc; obliging every one that Sub&s;cribed thereto, to give good real Security, to the full value of their &s;everal Sub&s;criptions, to Lie as a Fund or Security, to an&s;wer all the Notes or Bills I&s;&s;ued from the Bank; and to make good all Deficiencies, whereby the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors or Borrowers of the Bills or Notes were in no
<PB N="10" REF="001685_0011_0FB4D9A1296E7DB8">
danger of being wronged, with &s;ome other Amendments: The want of which Security in the fir&s;t Projection, is one of the mo&s;t popu|lar Arguments Mr. <HI>Attorney</HI> hath made u&s;e of to cry down the &s;ame. Now he being well Informed of the&s;e Alterations before he Pub|li&s;hed; Nay, before he delivered and &s;ent his Letter to you, whereby he certainly knew his &s;hort Ab&s;tract of the Projection, and his Form of the Bills, with his Addition of an E&s;chutch|eon, and con&s;equently all the fine Structure he builds thereon, to be but upon a &s;andy Foun|dation; tho' he would have the Honourable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives believe it.</P>
<P>And then he does in effect tell you, that the Projectors of the Bank have of their own heads formed them&s;elves into a Company, by a <HI>Constitution</HI> of their own making, and Erect|ing of them&s;elves into a <HI>Body Politick and Cor|porate to all Intents and Purpo&s;es in the Law</HI>; and then calls in the Prerogative and the Ho|nour of the Government to his Aid and A&s;|&s;i&s;tance. It's true, they have by a Con&s;titution of their own making, formed them&s;elves into a Company and Co-partner&s;hip, and that they take for granted they well might do without the lea&s;t affront to the Crown, or this Govern|ment, or el&s;e had never attempted it; for what's more common and u&s;ual then for Mer|chants and others to enter into Partner&s;hip, make their Rules, and oblige them&s;elves to
<PB N="11" REF="001685_0012_0FB4D9A6603FEF88">
the due ob&s;ervation of them. And does this make them a Body Politick, and Corporate to all intents and purpo&s;es in the Law, or en|croach upon the Prerogative, or di&s;honour this Government? What is it then the Projectors have done, that makes them &s;uch a Body Politick as Mr. <HI>Attorney</HI> pretends they are. Certainly no man but one in <HI>Eutopia</HI> could make &s;uch an Interpretation of their Articles as he has done. The Projectors, as he right|ly ob&s;erves, do not pretend to Incorporate, or make them&s;elves a Body Politick; neither does his partial de&s;cription of a Corporation, which he &s;ays is my Lord <HI>Cooks,</HI> with all the <HI>&amp;crs.</HI> he has put into it prove they have.</P>
<P>We agree with him, that all Bodies Politick are derived from the King as their Original Fountain; but it does not thence follow, that all Banks of Credit and Companies are, for that there have been &s;uch as never were Incorpora|ted: And does not the Sword Blade Compa|ny in <HI>London,</HI> continue even unto this day, to Emit their Notes to a very great Value by Tru&s;tees, and not Incorporated as a Bank of Credit; &s;o that their Emitting Notes or Bills is not in <HI>England</HI> accounted a <HI>thing intolerable, Unrea&s;onable and Unjust,</HI> and ab&s;olutely incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Honour, the Power and Wi&s;|dom of that Government, nor to &s;uffer a Num|ber of their own People to &s;et up an <HI>Ab&s;olute Independent Government,</HI> which like a Fire in
<PB N="12" REF="001685_0013_0FB4D9ADE6206FE0">
their Bowels, would burn up &amp; con&s;ume their whole Body. But Mr. <HI>Attorney</HI> it &s;eems is wi&s;er, &amp; &s;ees further into the Matter, than the Government of <HI>England</HI> doth. And then a|gain to prove the Erecting this Bank a Breach of Law, he brings in an Act of Parliament, made in the Sixth Year of the Reign of Queen <HI>ANNE,</HI> to wit, <HI>that during the Continuance of the Bank of</HI> England, <HI>it &s;hall not be lawful for a|ny Body Politick or Corporate, other than the &s;aid Company of the Bank, or for other Partners exceed|ing &s;ix in</HI> England <HI>to Borrow or Owe any Sum on Bill or Note, payable on demand, or at any time le&s;s than &s;ix Months from the Borrowing thereof.</HI> Now it is to be ob&s;erved, that this Law does not make any Number of Partners to be a Bo|dy Politick or Corporate, for their being in Partner&s;hip; Neither doth it forbid any &s;ix, or any other Number of Partners to Borrow or Owe any Sum on Bill or Note, payable at any time longer than &s;ix Months from the Borrow|ing. Mo&s;t certainly that Law was made in favour of the Bank of <HI>England</HI>; So that even in <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf before that Act had its force, it was lawful there for any Body Politick or Corporate, or Partners to Borrow or Owe any Sum on Bill or Note, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore will be Lawful again at the determination of that Bank. Then why may it not lawfully be done here, &s;ince that Act no ways affects this Province; For can Mr. <HI>Attorney</HI> ima|gine
<PB N="13" REF="001685_0014_0FB4D9BE03E8DAC0">
that &s;etting up a Bank of Credit in <HI>New-England,</HI> would in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure, prejudice the Bank of <HI>England</HI>: However, tho' he &s;ays he will not trouble him&s;elf to Argue how far this Projection would be a Breach upon the Bank of <HI>England</HI>; yet tells you, <HI>page</HI> 12. <HI>That certainly if the &s;ame Fact committed in</HI> England, <HI>by a Number exceeding &s;ix would be a Breach of Law; much more may we &s;uppo&s;e it forbidden and made Unlawful for an hundred to do it here.</HI> Certainly, this is a fine and accurate Mode of Rea&s;oning and Pungent Argument.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e our Law forbids us Building of Wooden Hou&s;es in <HI>Boston,</HI> therefore we mu&s;t not Erect one in <HI>Lynn,</HI> or the Province of <HI>Main.</HI></P>
<P>As to what he &s;ays of the Projection not being founded in <HI>Commutative Justice</HI> and <HI>Com|mon Honesty,</HI> and that he can't &s;ee the Rea&s;o|nablene&s;s and Ju&s;tice of it, betwixt the Sub|&s;cribers and Borrowers; and therefore mu&s;t unavoidably prove a <HI>great Snare and Mi&s;chief</HI> to tho&s;e that want Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To make a &s;hew of the Proof thereof, he Argues from his own fal&s;e Ab&s;tract of the Projection, &s;o that he di&s;puting <HI>Ex non Conce&s;&s;is</HI>; all he draws from thence, together with his <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> grounded thereon, mu&s;t needs fall of it &s;elf, &amp; come to nothing. And it is plain, his de&s;ign was only to amu&s;e the People, but more particularly the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives: Now &s;ince the
<PB N="14" REF="001685_0015_0FB4D9CF05C54798">
Projection obliges every Sub&s;criber to Mort|gage a Real E&s;tate, of the full value of what he Sub&s;cribes for, to make a &s;ufficient Fund for the Credit of their Notes and Bills; as likewi&s;e to An&s;wer all Deficiencies ari&s;ing by any defect or default of the Projectors in the afore&s;aid Scheme; Whereby the Borrowers or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Notes or Bills are &s;ure to have Ju&s;tice done them; and all concern|ed with them, in ca&s;e the Bank &s;hould come to an end, even then will the la&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors of their Bills or Notes have good Secu|rity to depend on: Notwith&s;tanding all the Objector hath &s;aid, or po&s;&s;ibly can &s;ay: They &s;till having their Credit and Value from the Intrin&s;ick Value of the Bank, and not from what his Bubbled Borrowers give them, as he groundle&s;ly a&s;&s;erts. He mu&s;t needs &s;uppo&s;e the Hou&s;e to be a&s;leep, and &s;o to need awa|kening, as <HI>page</HI> 5. when he a&s;&s;erts, <HI>page</HI> 19. that by the Tenour of the Bills you &s;ee, they are only obliged to Accept of them for the Redemption of <HI>Pawns</HI> and <HI>Mortgages</HI>: When in his Reciting the Tenour of the Bill, <HI>page</HI> 7. He owns that we oblige our &s;elves to Accept the &s;ame in ALL PAYMENTS according to Covenant made by us on Publick Record, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which how directly he Contradicts him&s;elf, &amp; endeavours to Mi&s;lead the Hou&s;e, we leave you and the World to judge: Nor would the Projectors have the Profits of other Mens E|&s;tates,
<PB N="15" REF="001685_0016_0FB4D9D7E2AF8FF8">
much le&s;s the E&s;tates them&s;elves with|out a valuable Con&s;ideration, nor make them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of any E&s;tates but their own, which they willingly Depo&s;it and Mortgage for a General Benefit for the Loan and Credit whereof it's as lawful for them to take Intere&s;t, as it is for Mr. <HI>Attorney</HI> for his Bills of Credit on the Province. The Bank Bills having a bet|ter and more certain Security than the Publick Loan Bills, and more ea&s;ily obtained, in Ca&s;e that late Act &s;hould be Repealed: And for that Rea&s;on his Argument again&s;t the Private Bank is of far greater &s;trength and force a|gain&s;t the Publick Bank.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Attorney <HI>is plea&s;ed often to put you in mind, that this Prejection breaks in upon, and Invalidates the Con&s;titution of this Province, page</HI> 4. 15. <HI>The Act of Parliament of late made Referring to Money in the Plantations, de&s;igning thereby to awaken the Government upon this great occa&s;ion, to Exert their proper Power, and not &s;uffer the Projection to proceed, but by &s;ome proper Act, and Publick Order, to declare again&s;t, and forbid it, lest thereby the Constitution of the Government of the Province be broke in upon, and endangered: Becau&s;e we are a Dependent Government, and mu&s;t in all things Conform our &s;elves to the Laws of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>and In&s;tructions of the Crown, and therefore mu&s;t expect to give an Account of all our Matters.</HI></P>
<P>Now if the &s;uffering of this Private Bank to be

Set up and E&s;tabli&s;h things contrary to the Law, as for a Number of Private Per&s;ons; and does not the Law of <HI>England</HI> which he &s;aith would be broke in upon, by Erecting a Private Bank, much more re&s;pect a Corporation than Private Per&s;ons; and which he him&s;elf readily grants it doth. Is not this then one effectual way to endanger the Con&s;titution of the Go|vernment, the utter Ruin &amp; Lo&s;s of the Charter, &amp; the many Liberties we hold &amp; enjoy thereby.
