<P>THIS day the great and illu&s;trious WASHING|TON, the favourite &s;on of liberty, and deliverer of his country, entered upon the execution of the office of Fir&s;t Magi&s;trate of the United States of America; to which important &s;tation he had been unanimou&s;ly called by the united voice of the people. The ceremony which took place on this occa&s;ion was truly grand and plea&s;ing, and every heart &s;eemed anxious to te&s;tify the joy it felt on &s;o memorable an event. His Excellency was e&s;corted from his hou&s;e, by a troop of light dragoons, and the le|gion under the command of colonel LEWIS, attended by a committee of the Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, to Federal Hall, where he was formally received by both hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, a&s;&s;embled in the Senate Chamber; after which he was conducted to the gallery in front of the hall, accompanied by all the members, when the oath pre|&s;cribed by the Con&s;titution was admini&s;tered to him by the Chancellor of this State, who then &s;aid,
"LONG LIVE GEORGE WASHINGTON,
Pre&s;ident of the United States;" which was an&s;wered by an immen&s;e concour&s;e of citizens, a&s;&s;embled the occa|&s;ion, by the loude&s;t plaudit and acclamation, that love and veneration ever in&s;pired. He then made the following &s;peech.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE, AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONG the vici&s;&s;itudes incident to life, no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was tran&s;mitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the pre&s;ent month. On the one hand, I was &s;ummoned by my country, who&s;e voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a re|treat which I had cho&s;en with the fonde&s;t predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable deci&s;ion as the a&s;ylum of my declining years: A retreat which was rendered every day more nece&s;&s;ary as well as more dear to me, by the addition of habit to inclination, and of fre|quent interruptions in my health to the gradual wa&s;te com|mitted on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the tru&s;t to which the voice of my coun|try called me, being &s;ufficient to awaken in the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t experienced of her citizens, a di&s;tru&s;tful &s;crutiny in|to his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with de&s;|pondence one, who, inheriting inferior endowments from nature, and unpracti&s;ed in the duties of civil admini&s;tra|tion, ought to be peculiarly con&s;cious of his own defici|encies. In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver is, that it has been my faithful &s;tudy to collect my duty from a ju&s;t appreciation of every circum&s;tance by which it might be affected. All I dare hope is, that if in executing this ta&s;k I have been too much &s;wayed by a grateful remem|brance of former in&s;tance&punc; or by an affectionate &s;en&s;ibility to this tran&s;cendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens; and have thence too little con&s;ulted my incapa|city as well as di&s;inclination for the weighty and untried cares before me; my error will be palliated by the mo|tives which mi&s;led me, and its con&s;equences be judged by my country, with &s;ome &s;hare of the partiality in which they originated.</P>
<P>Such being the impre&s;&s;ions under which I have, in obe|dience to the public &s;ummons, repaired to the pre&s;ent &s;ta|tion,
<PB N="15" REF="031402_0008_0FEF91906B11E4E8">
it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this fir&s;t official act, my &s;ervent &s;upplications to that Almighty Be|ing, who rules over the univer&s;e, who pre&s;ides in the councils of nations, and who&s;e providential aids can &s;up|ply every human defect, that his benediction may con&s;e|crate to the liberties and happine&s;s of the people of the United States, a government in&s;tituted by them&s;elves for the&s;e e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;es, and may enable every in&s;trument employed in its admini&s;tration, to execute with &s;ucce&s;s, the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this hom|age to the great Author of every public and private good, I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf that it expre&s;&s;es your &s;entiments not le&s;s than my own; nor tho&s;e of my fellow citizens at large, le&s;s than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invi&s;ible hand, which conducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States. Every &s;tep, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, &s;eems to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome token of providential agency. And in the import|ant revolution ju&s;t accompli&s;hed in, the &s;y&s;tem of their united government, the tranquil deliberations and volun|tary con&s;ent of &s;o many di&s;tinct communities, from which the event has re&s;ulted, cannot be compared with the means by which mo&s;t governments have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, without &s;ome return of pious gratitude along with an humble an|ticipation of the future ble&s;&s;ings which the pa&s;t &s;eem to pre&s;age. The&s;e reflections, ari&s;ing out of the pre&s;ent cri|&s;is, have forced them&s;elves too &s;trongly on my mind to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. You will join with me, I tru&s;t, in thinking that there are none under the influence of which, the pro|ceedings of a new and free government can more au&s;pici|ou&s;ly commence.</P>
<P>By the article e&s;tabli&s;hing the executive department, it is made, the duty of the Pre&s;ident "to recommend to your con&s;ideration, &s;uch mea&s;ures as he &s;hall judge nece&s;|&s;ary and expedient." The circum&s;tances under which I now meet you, will acquit me from entering into that &s;ub|ject farther than to refer you to the great Con&s;titutional Charter under which we are a&s;&s;embled; and which, in de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ining your powers, de&s;ignates the objects to which your at|tention
<PB N="16" REF="031402_0009_0FEF919675B11E00">
is to be given. It will be more con&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e circum&s;tances, and far more congenial with the feel|ings which actuate me, to &s;ub&s;titute in place of a recom|mendation of particular mea&s;ures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patrioti&s;m which adorn the characters &s;elected to devi&s;e and adopt them. In the&s;e honourable qualifications, I behold the fure&s;t pledges, that as on one &s;ide, no local prejudices or attachments, no &s;eparate views nor party animo&s;ities, will mi&s;direct the comprehen&s;ive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great a&s;&s;emblage of communities and intere&s;ts: &s;o, on another, that the foundations of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private moral|ity; and the pre-eminence of a free government be exem|plified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens, and command the re&s;pect of the world.</P>
<P>I dwell on this pro&s;pect with every &s;atisfaction which an ardent love for my country can in&s;pire; &s;ince there is no truth more thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed, than that there ex|i&s;ts in the economy and cour&s;e of nature, an indi&s;&s;oluble union between virtue and happine&s;s&mdash;between duty and advantage&mdash;between the genuine maxims of an hone&s;t and magnanimous policy, and the &s;olid rewards of public pro&s;perity and felicity. Since we ought to be no le&s;s per|&s;uaded that the propitious &s;miles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that di&s;regards the eternal rules of order and right, which Heaven it&s;elf has ordained. And &s;ince the pre&s;ervation of the &s;acred fire of liberty, and the de&s;tiny of the republican model of government, are ju&s;tly con&s;idered as <HI>deeply,</HI> perhaps, as <HI>finally</HI> &s;taked, on the ex|periment entru&s;ted to the hands of the American people.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the ordinary objects &s;ubmitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an ex|erci&s;e of the occa&s;ional power delegated by the Fifth Arti|cle of the Con&s;titution is rendered expedient at the pre&s;ent juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged again&s;t the &s;y&s;tem, or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them. In&s;tead of undertaking particu|lar recommendations on this &s;ubject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I
<PB N="17" REF="031402_0009_0FEF919675B11E00">
&s;hall again give way to my entire confidence in your di&s;|cernment and pur&s;uit of the public good: For I a&s;&s;ure my|&s;elf, that whil&s;t you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective gov|ernment, or which ought to await the future le&s;&s;ons of ex|perience; a reverence for the characteri&s;tic rights of free|men, and a regard for the public harmony, will &s;ufficiently influence your deliberations on the que&s;tion, how far the former can be more impregnably fortified, or the latter be &s;afely and advantageou&s;ly promoted.</P>
<P>To the preceding ob&s;ervations I have one to add, which will be mo&s;t properly addre&s;&s;ed to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;ent|atives. It concerns my&s;elf, and will therefore be as brief as po&s;&s;ible. When I was fir&s;t honoured with a call into the &s;ervice of my country, then on the eve of an arduous &s;truggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty, required that I &s;hould renounce every pecuniary compen&s;ation. From this re&s;olution I have in no in&s;tance departed. And being &s;till under the impre&s;&s;ions which pro|duced it, I mu&s;t decline as inapplicable to my&s;elf, any &s;hare in the per&s;onal emoluments, which may be indi&s;pen&s;ably in|cluded in a permanent provi&s;ion for the executive depart|ment; and mu&s;t accordingly pray that the pecuniary e&s;ti|mates for the &s;tation in which I am placed, may, during my continuation in it, be limited to &s;uch actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require.</P>
<P>Having thus imparted to you my &s;entiments, as they have been awakened by the occa&s;ion which brings us to|gether, I &s;hall take my pre&s;ent leave; but not without re|forting once more to the benign Parent of the human race, in humble &s;upplication, that &s;ince he has been plea&s;ed to favour the American people with, opportunities for deliber|ating in perfect tranquillity, and di&s;po&s;itions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity on a form of government for the &s;ecurity of their Union, and the advancement of their happine&s;s; &s;o his divine ble&s;&s;ing may be equally <HI>con&s;picuous</HI> in the enlarged views, the temperate con&s;ultations, and the wi&s;e mea&s;ures on which the &s;ucce&s;s of this government mu&s;t depend.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE, the Senate of the United States, return you our &s;incere thanks for your excellent &s;peech, delivered to both Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, congratulate you on the com|plete organization of the federal government, and felicitate our&s;elves and our fellow-citizens, on your elevation to the office of Pre&s;ident, an office, highly important by the pow|ers con&s;titutionally annexed to it, and extremely honoura|ble from the manner in which the appointment is made. The unanimous &s;uffrage of the elective body in your favour, is peculiarly expre&s;&s;ive of the gratitude, confidence and af|fection of the citizens of America, and is the highe&s;t te&s;ti|monial at once of your merit, and of their e&s;teem. We are &s;en&s;ible, Sir, that nothing but the voice of your fellow-citizens, could have called you from a retreat, cho&s;en by the fonde&s;t predilection, endeared by habit, and con&s;ecrated to the repo&s;e of declining years; we rejoice, and with us, all America, that, in obedience to the call of our common country, you have returned once more to public life. In you all parties confide, in you all intere&s;ts unite, and we have no doubt, that your pa&s;t &s;ervices, great as they have been, will be equalled by your future exertions; and that your prudence and &s;agacity as a &s;tate&s;man, will tend to avert the dangers to which we were expo&s;ed, to give &s;ta|bility to the pre&s;ent government, and dignity and &s;plendour to that country, which your &s;kill and valour as a &s;oldier, &s;o eminently contributed to rai&s;e to independence and empire.</P>
<P>When we contemplate the coincidence of circum&s;tances, and wonderful combination of cau&s;es, which gradually pre|pared the people of this country for independence; when we contemplate the ri&s;e, progre&s;s and termination of the late war, which gave them a name among the nations of the earth, we are, with you, unavoidably led to acknowl|edge and adore the great Arbiter of the univer&s;e, by whom empires ri&s;e and fall. A review of the many &s;ignal in|&s;tances
<PB N="19" REF="031402_0010_0FEF919804C68CA8">
of divine interpo&s;ition in favour of this country, claims our mo&s;t pious gratitude. And permit us, Sir, to ob&s;erve, that among the great events which have led to the formation and e&s;tabli&s;hment of a federal government, we e&s;teem your acceptance of the office of Pre&s;ident as one of the mo&s;t propitious and important.</P>
<P>In execution of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in us, we &s;hall endeav|our to pur&s;ue that enlarged and liberal policy, to which your &s;peech &s;o happily directs. We are con&s;cious that the pro&s;perity of each State is in&s;eparably connected with the welfare of all, and that in promoting the latter, we &s;hall effectually advance the former. In full per&s;ua&s;ion of this truth, it &s;hall be our invariable aim to dive&s;t our&s;elves of local prejudices and attachments, and to view the great a&s;|&s;emblage of communities and intere&s;ts committed to our charge with an equal eye. We feel, Sir, the force, and acknowledge the ju&s;tne&s;s of the ob&s;ervation, that the foun|dation of our national policy &s;hould be laid in private mo|rality. If individuals be not influenced by moral princi|ples, it is in vain to look for public virtue; it is, therefore, the duty of legi&s;lators to enforce, both by precept and ex|ample, the utility as well as the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;trict adher|ence to the rules of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice. We beg you to be a&s;&s;ured, that the Senate will at all times cheerfully co-oper|erate in every mea&s;ure, which may &s;trengthen the Union, conduce to the happine&s;s, or &s;ecure and perpetuate the lib|erties of this great Con&s;ederated Republic.</P>
<P>We commend you, Sir, to the protection of Almighty GOD, earne&s;tly be&s;eeching him long to pre&s;erve a life &s;o valuable and dear to the people of the United States; and that your admini&s;tration may be pro&s;perous to the nation and glorious to your&s;elf.</P>

<P>I THANK you for your addre&s;s, in which the mo&s;t affectionate &s;entiments are expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t obliging terms. The coincidence of circum&s;tances which led to this au&s;picious cri&s;is; the confidence repo&s;ed in me by my fellow-citizens, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I may expect from coun|&s;els which will be dictated by an enlarged and liberal pol|icy, &s;eem to pre&s;age a more pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue to my admin|i&s;tration, than a diffidence of my abilities had taught me to anticipate. I now feel my&s;elf inexpre&s;&s;ibly happy in a belief, that Heaven, which has done &s;o much for our in|fant nation, will not withdraw its providential influence before our political felicity &s;hall have been completed; and in a conviction that the Senate will at all times co-operate in every mea&s;ure which may tend to promote the welfare of this Confederated Republic.</P>
<P>Thus &s;upported by a firm tru&s;t in the great Arbiter of the univer&s;e, aided by the collected wi&s;dom of the Union, and imploring the divine benediction on our joint exertions in the &s;ervice of our country, I readily engage with you in the arduous but plea&s;ing ta&s;k of attempting to make a na|tion happy.</P>

<P>THE Repre&s;entatives of the people of the United States pre&s;ent their congratulations on the event by which your fellow-citizens have atte&s;ted the pre-eminence of your merit. You have long held the fir&s;t place in their e&s;teem; you have often received tokens of their affection; you now po&s;&s;e&s;s the only proof that remained of their gratitude for
<PB N="21" REF="031402_0011_0FEF91999222F1C0">

<P>We well know the anxieties with which you mu&s;t have obeyed a &s;ummons, from the repo&s;e re&s;erved for your de|clining years, into public &s;cenes, of which you had taken your leave forever; but the obedience was due to the oc|ca&s;ion. It is already applauded by the univer&s;al joy which welcomes you to your &s;tation, and we cannot doubt but that it will be rewarded with all the &s;atisfaction, with which an ardent love for your fellow citizens mu&s;t review &s;ucce&s;sful efforts to promote their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>This anticipation is not ju&s;tified merely by the pa&s;t ex|perience of your &s;ignal &s;ervices. It is particularly &s;ugge&s;t|ed by the pious impre&s;&s;ions under which you commence your admini&s;tration, and the enlightened maxims by which you mean to conduct it. We feel with you the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to adore the invi&s;ible hand which has led the American people through &s;o many difficulties, to cheri&s;h a con&s;cious re&s;pon&s;ibility for the de&s;tiny of republican liberty, and to &s;eek the only &s;ure means of pre&s;erving and recom|mending the precious depo&s;it in a &s;y&s;tem of legi&s;lation, founded on the principles of an hone&s;t policy, and directed by the &s;pirit of a diffu&s;ive patrioti&s;m.</P>

<P>YOUR very affectionate addre&s;s produces emotions which I know not how to expre&s;s. I feel that my pa&s;t endeavours in the &s;ervice of my country are far overpaid by its goodne&s;s; and I fear much that my future ones may not fulfil your kind anticipation. All that I can promi&s;e is, that they will be invariably directed by an hone&s;t and an ardent zeal. Of this re&s;ource my heart a&s;&s;ures me. For all beyond, I rely on the wi&s;dom and patrioti&s;m of tho&s;e with whom I am to co-operate, and a continuance of the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven on our beloved country.</P>

<P>I EMBRACE with great &s;atisfaction the opportunity which now pre&s;ents it&s;elf, of congratulating you on the pre&s;ent favourable pro&s;pects of our public affairs. The re|cent acce&s;&s;ion of the important State of North-Carolina to the Con&s;titution of the United States (of which official in|formation has been received) the ri&s;ing credit and re&s;pecta|bility of our country, the general and increa&s;ing good-will towards the government of the Union, and the concord, peace and plenty, with which we are ble&s;&s;ed, are circum|&s;tances au&s;picious, in an eminent degree, to our national pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>In re&s;uming your con&s;ultations for the general good, you cannot but derive encouragement from the reflection, that the mea&s;ures of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion have been as &s;atisfactory to your con&s;tituents, as the novelty and difficulty of the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize their expec|tations, and to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings which a gracious Provi|dence has placed within our reach, will, in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent important &s;e&s;&s;ion, call for the cool and delibe|rate exertion of your patrioti&s;m, firmne&s;s, and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Among the many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntere&s;ting objects which will engage your attention, that of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard. To be prepared for war is one of the mo&s;t effectual means of pre&s;erving peace.</P>
<P>A free people ought not only to be armed, but di&s;ci|plined; to which end a uniform and well-dige&s;ted plan is requi&s;ite: And their &s;afety and intere&s;t require that they &s;hould promote &s;uch manufactories, as tend to render them
<PB N="24" REF="031402_0013_0FEF919EC695D638">
independent on others, for e&s;&s;ential, particularly for mili|tary &s;upplies.</P>
<P>The proper e&s;tabli&s;hment of the troops which may be deemed indi&s;pen&s;able, will be entitled to mature con&s;idera|tion. In the arrangements which may be made re&s;pecting it, it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable &s;upport of the officers and &s;oldiers, with a due regard to economy.</P>
<P>There was rea&s;on to hope, that the pacific mea&s;ures adopted with regard to certain ho&s;tile tribes of Indians, would have relieved the inhabitants of our &s;outhern and we&s;tern frontiers from their depredations. But you will perceive, by the informations contained in the papers, which I &s;hall direct to be laid before you, (comprehending a communication from the Commonwealth of Virginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford protection to tho&s;e parts of the Union; and, if nece&s;&s;ary, to puni&s;h aggre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of the United States requires, that our in|tercour&s;e with other nations &s;hall be facilitated by &s;uch pro|vi&s;ions as will enable me to fulfil my duty in that re&s;pect, in the manner which circum&s;tances may render mo&s;t conducive to the public good: And to this end, that the compen&s;a|tions to be made to the per&s;ons who may be employed, &s;hould, according to the nature of their appointments, be defined by law; and a competent fund de&s;ignated for de|fraying the expen&s;es incident to the conduct of our foreign affairs.</P>
<P>Various con&s;iderations al&s;o render it expedient, that the terms on which foreigners may be admitted to the rights of citizens, &s;hould be &s;peedily a&s;certained by a uniform rule of naturalization.</P>
<P>Uniformity in the currency, weights and mea&s;ures of the United States, is an object of great importance, and will, I am per&s;uaded, be duly attended to.</P>
<P>The advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manu|factures, by all proper means, will not, I tru&s;t, need rec|ommendation. But I cannot forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction of new and u&s;eful inventions from abroad, as to the exertions of &s;kill and genius in producing
<PB N="25" REF="031402_0013_0FEF919EC695D638">
them at home; and of facilitating the intercour&s;e between the di&s;tant parts of our country, by a due attention to the po&s;t office and po&s;t roads.</P>
<P>Nor am I le&s;s per&s;uaded, that you will agree with me in opinion, that there is nothing which can better de&s;erve your patronage, than the promotion of &s;cience and literature. Knowledge is in every country the &s;ure&s;t ba&s;is of public happine&s;s. In one, in which the mea&s;ures of government receive their impre&s;&s;ion &s;o immediately from the &s;en&s;e of the community, as in ours, it is proportionably e&s;&s;ential. To the &s;ecurity of a free con&s;titution it contributes in vari|ous ways. By convincing tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the public admini&s;tration, that every valuable end of govern|ment is be&s;t an&s;wered by the enlightened confidence of the people: And by teaching the people them&s;elves to know, and to value their own rights; to di&s;cern and provide again&s;t inva&s;ions of them; to di&s;tingui&s;h between oppre&s;&s;ion and the nece&s;&s;ary exerci&s;e of lawful authority; between burthens proceeding from a di&s;regard to their convenience, and tho&s;e re&s;ulting from the inevitable exigencies of &s;ociety; to di&s;|criminate the &s;pirit of liberty from that of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, cheri&s;hing the fir&s;t, avoiding the la&s;t, and uniting a &s;peedy, but temperate vigilance again&s;t encroachments, with an in|violable re&s;pect to the laws.</P>
<P>Whether this de&s;irable object will be the be&s;t promoted by affording aids to &s;eminaries of learning already e&s;tab|li&s;hed, by the in&s;titution of a national univer&s;ity, or by any other expedients, will be well worthy of a place in the de|liberations of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</P>
<P>I SAW with peculiar plea&s;ure, at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, the re&s;olution entered into by you, expre&s;&s;ive of your opinion, that an adequate provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of the public credit is a matter of high importance to the na|tional honour and pro&s;perity. In this &s;entiment I entirely concur.

It would be &s;uperfluous to &s;pecify inducements to a mea&s;ure in which the character and permanent intere&s;ts of the United States are &s;o obviou&s;ly and &s;o deeply concerned; and which has received &s;o explicit a &s;anction from your declaration.</P>

<P>WE, the Senate of the United States, return you our thanks for your &s;peech delivered to both Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s. The acce&s;&s;ion of the State of North-Carolina to the confederation of the United States, gives us much plea&s;ure; and we offer you our congratulations on that event, which at the &s;ame time adds &s;trength to our Union, and affords a proof that the more the Con&s;titution has been con&s;idered, the more the goodne&s;s of it has appeared. The information which we have received, that the mea&s;ures of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion have been as &s;atisfactory to our con&s;titu|ents as we had rea&s;on to expect from the difficulty of the bu&s;ine&s;s in which we were engaged, will afford us much con&s;olation and encouragement in re&s;uming our delibera|tions

We are per&s;uaded that one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential means of pre&s;erving peace, is to be prepared for war, and our attention &s;hall be directed to the objects of common defence, and to the adoption of &s;uch plans as &s;hall appear the mo&s;t likely to prevent our de|pendence on other countries for e&s;&s;ential &s;upplies.

<P>IN meeting you again, I feel much &s;atisfaction, in being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable pro&s;|pects which continue to di&s;tingui&s;h our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have ble&s;&s;ed our country with plenty, and with the means of a flouri&s;hing commerce. The progre&s;s of public credit is witne&s;&s;ed by a con&s;iderable ri&s;e of American &s;tock abroad, as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purpo&s;es have been productive beyond the calculations by which they were regulated. This latter circum&s;tance is the more plea&s;ing, as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our re&s;ources, but as it a&s;&s;ures us of a further increa&s;e of the national re|&s;pectability and credit; and, let me add, as it bears an hon|ourable te&s;timony to the patrioti&s;m and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens. The punctual|ity of the former in di&s;charging their engagements has been exemplary.</P>
<P>In conforming to the powers ve&s;ted in me by the acts of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, a loan of 3,000,000 of florins, towards which &s;ome provi&s;ional mea&s;ures had previou&s;ly taken place, has been completed in Holland. As well the celerity with which it has been filled, as the nature of the terms (con|&s;idering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing, cre|ated by the &s;ituation of Europe) give a rea&s;onable hope, that the further execution of tho&s;e powers may proceed with advantage and &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;ecretary of the trea&s;|ury has my directions to communicate &s;uch further partic|ulars as may be requi&s;ite for more preci&s;e information.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="031402_0017_0FEF91AC24B30500">Since your la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions, I have received communications by which it appears, that the di&s;trict of Kentucky, at pre&s;|ent a part of Virginia, has concurred in certain propo&s;i|tions in a law of that State, in con&s;equence of which the di&s;trict is to become a di&s;tinct member of the Union; in ca&s;e the requi&s;ite &s;anction of Congre&s;s be added. For this &s;anction application is now made. I &s;hall cau&s;e the papers on this very important tran&s;action to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been con|ducted, will be found to do great honour to both the par|ties; and the &s;entiments of warm attachment to the Union and its pre&s;ent government, expre&s;&s;ed by our fellow-citi|zens of Kentucky, cannot fail to add an affectionate con|cern for their particular welfare, to the great national im|pre&s;&s;ions under which you will decide on the ca&s;e &s;ubmit|ted to you.</P>
<P>It has been heretofore known to Congre&s;s, that frequent incur&s;ions have been made on our frontier &s;ettlements by certain banditti of Indians, from the north-we&s;t &s;ide of the Ohio. The&s;e, with &s;ome of the tribes dwelling on and near the Waba&s;h, have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and, being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes, and aided by &s;uch parts (the neighbouring tribes as could be &s;educed to join in their ho&s;tilities, or af|ford them a retreat for their pri&s;oners and plunder, they have, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States, renewed their violences with fre&s;h alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been &s;acri|ficed, and &s;ome of them under circum&s;tances particularly &s;hocking, whil&s;t others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.</P>
<P>The&s;e aggravated provocations rendered it e&s;&s;ential to the &s;afety of the we&s;tern &s;ettlements, that the aggre&s;&s;ors &s;hould be made &s;en&s;ible that the government of the Union is not le&s;s capable of puni&s;hing their crimes, than it is di&s;|po&s;ed to re&s;pect their rights and reward their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defen&s;ive mea&s;ures, it became nece&s;&s;ary to put in force the act which empowers THE PRESIDENT to call out the militia for the protection
<PB N="33" REF="031402_0017_0FEF91AC24B30500">
of the frontiers: And I have accordingly authori&s;ed an expedition, in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with &s;uch drafts of militia as were deemed &s;uf|ficient. The event of the mea&s;ure is yet unknown to me. The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a &s;tate|ment of the information on which it is founded, as well as an e&s;timate of the expen&s;e with which it will be attended.</P>
<P>The di&s;turbed &s;ituation of Europe, and particularly the critical po&s;ture of the great maritime powers, whil&s;t it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and &s;ecurity enjoyed by the United States, reminds us at the &s;ame time of the circum&s;pection with which it becomes us to pre&s;erves the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings. It requires al&s;o, that we &s;hould not overlook the tendency of a war, and even of preparations for a war among the nations mo&s;t concerned in active commerce with this country, to abridge the means, and thereby at lea&s;t enhance the price of tran&s;porting its valuable productions to proper markets. I recommend it to your &s;erious reflections, how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard again&s;t embarra&s;&s;ments from the&s;e contingencies, by &s;uch encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture le&s;s dependent on foreign bottoms, which may fail us in the very moments mo&s;t intere&s;ting to both of the&s;e great objects. Our fi&s;heries, and the tran&s;portation of our own produce, offer us abundant means for guarding our&s;elves again&s;t this evil.</P>
<P>Your attention &s;eems to be not le&s;s due to that particu|lar branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterra|nean.

<P>WE receive, Sir, with particular &s;atisfaction, the com|munications contained in your &s;peech, which confirm to us the progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of the public credit, and afford at the &s;ame time a new proof of the &s;olidity of the foundation on which it re&s;ts; and we cheerfully join in the acknowledg|ment which is due to the probity and patrioti&s;m of the mer|cantile and maritime part of our fellow-citizens, who&s;e en|lightened attachment to the principles of government is not le&s;s con&s;picuous in this, than it has been in other import|ant re&s;pects.</P>
<P>In confidence that every con&s;titutional preliminary has been ob&s;erved, we a&s;&s;ure you of our di&s;po&s;ition to concur in giving the requi&s;ite &s;anction to the admi&s;&s;ion of Ken|tucky, as a di&s;tinct member of the Union; in doing which, we &s;hall anticipate the happy effects to be expected from the &s;entiments of attachment towards the Union and its pre&s;ent government, which have been expre&s;&s;ed by the pa|triotic inhabitants of that di&s;trict.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Repre&s;entatives of the people of the United States have taken into con&s;ideration your addre&s;s to the two Hou&s;es at the opening of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>We &s;hare in the &s;atisfaction in&s;pired by the pro&s;pects which continue to be &s;o au&s;picious to our public affairs. The ble&s;&s;ings re&s;ulting from the &s;miles of Heaven on our agriculture, the ri&s;e of public credit, with the further ad|vantages promi&s;ed by it, and the fertility of re&s;ources which are found &s;o little burden&s;ome to the community, fully au|thori&s;e our mutual congratulations on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Nor can we learn without an additional gratification, that the energy of the laws for providing adequate revenues have been &s;o honourably &s;econded by tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es of citizens who&s;e patrioti&s;m and probity were more immediately con|cerned.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the loan opened in Holland, under the di&s;advantages of the pre&s;ent moment, is the more import|ant, as it not only denotes the confidence already placed in the United States, but as the effect of a judicious applica|tion of that aid, will &s;till further illu&s;trate the &s;olidity of the foundation on which the public credit re&s;ts.</P>
<P>The preparatory &s;teps taken by the State of Virginia in concert with the di&s;trict of Kentucky towards the erection of the latter into a di&s;tinct member of the Union, exhib|it a liberality mutually honourable to the parties. We &s;hall be&s;tow on this important &s;ubject the favourable con|&s;ideration which it merits; and with the national policy which ought to govern our deci&s;ion, &s;hall not fail to min|gle the affectionate &s;entiments, which are awakened by by tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ed in behalf of our fellow-citizens of Ken|tucky.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we regret the nece&s;&s;ity which has produced of|fen&s;ive ho&s;tilities again&s;t &s;ome of the Indian tribes north|we&s;t of the Ohio, we &s;ympathize too much with our we&s;t|ern brethren not to behold with approbation the watchful|ne&s;s
<PB N="38" REF="031402_0020_0FEF91B7031BEDD0">
and vigour which have been exerted by the executive authority, for their protection; and which, we tru&s;t, will make aggre&s;&s;ors &s;en&s;ible that it is their intere&s;t to merit by a peaceable behaviour the friend&s;hip and humanity which the United States are always ready to extend to them.</P>
<P>The encouragement of our own navigation, has, at all times, appeared to us highly important. The point of view under which you recommended it to us is &s;trongly en|forced by the actual &s;tate of things in Europe. It will be incumbent on us to con&s;ider in what mode our com|merce and agriculture can be be&s;t relieved from an injuri|ous dependence on the navigation of other nations, which the frequency of their wars renders a too precarious re|&s;ource for conveying the productions of our country to market.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tate of our trade to the Mediterranean, &s;eems not le&s;s to demand, and will accordingly receive, the attention which you have recommended.</P>
<P>Having already concurred in e&s;tabli&s;hing a judiciary &s;y&s;|tem, which opens the door of ju&s;tice to all, without di&s;|tinction of per&s;ons, it will be our di&s;po&s;ition to incorporate every improvement which experience may &s;ugge&s;t: and we &s;hall con&s;ider in particular, how far the uniformity which in other ca&s;es is found convenient in the admini&s;tra|tion of the general government through all the States, may be introduced into the forms and rules of executing &s;en|tences i&s;&s;uing from the federal courts.</P>
<P>The proper regulation of the juri&s;diction and functions which may be exerci&s;ed by con&s;uls of the United States in foreign countries, with the provi&s;ions &s;tipulated to tho&s;e of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty e&s;tabli&s;hed here, are &s;ubjects of too much con&s;equence to the public intere&s;t and honour, not to partake of our deliberations.</P>
<P>We &s;hall renew our attention to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the militia and the other &s;ubjects unfini&s;hed at the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;hall proceed in them with all the di&s;patch, which the magnitude of all, and the difficulty of &s;ome of them, will allow.</P>
<P>Nothing has given us more &s;atisfaction than to find that the revenues heretofore e&s;tabli&s;hed have proved adequate to
<PB N="39" REF="031402_0020_0FEF91B7031BEDD0">
the purpo&s;es to which they were allotted. In extending the provi&s;ion to the re&s;iduary objects, it will be equally our care to &s;ecure &s;ufficiency and punctuality in the payments due from the trea&s;ury of the United States. We &s;hall al&s;o never lo&s;e &s;ight of the policy of dimini&s;hing the public debt, as fa&s;t as the increa&s;e of the public re&s;ources will per|mit; and are particularly &s;en&s;ible of the many con&s;idera|tions which pre&s;s a re&s;ort to the auxiliary re&s;ource furni&s;h|ed by the public lands.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uing every branch of the weighty bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, it will be our con&s;tant &s;tudy to direct our deliberations to the public welfare. Whatever our &s;ucce&s;s may be, we can at lea&s;t an&s;wer for the fervent love of our country, which ought to animate our endeavours. In your co-operation, we are &s;ure of a re&s;ource, which fortifies our hopes, that the fruits of the e&s;tabli&s;hed government will ju&s;tify the confidence which has been placed in it, and rec|ommend it more and more to the affection and attachment of our fellow-citizens.</P>

<P>I MEET you, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, with the feel|ings, which are naturally in&s;pired by a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of the pro&s;perous &s;ituation of our common country, and by a per&s;ua&s;ion equally &s;trong, that the labours of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, which has ju&s;t commenced, will, under the guidance of the &s;pirit, no le&s;s prudent than patriotic, i&s;&s;ue in mea&s;ures conducive to the &s;tability and increa&s;e of national pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Numerous as are the providential ble&s;&s;ings which de|mand our grateful acknowledgments; the abundance with which another year has again rewarded the indu&s;try of the hu&s;bandman, is too important to e&s;cape recollection.</P>
<P>Your own ob&s;ervations, in your re&s;pective &s;ituations, will have &s;atisfied you of the progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation: in tracing their cau&s;es, you will have remarked, with particular plea&s;ure, the happy effects of that revival of confidence, public as well as private, to which the con&s;titution and laws of the United States have &s;o eminently contributed; and you will have ob&s;erved, with no le&s;s intere&s;t, new and deci|&s;ive proofs of the increa&s;ing reputation and credit of the nation. But you, neverthele&s;s, cannot fail to derive &s;ati&s;|faction from the confirmation of the&s;e circum&s;tances, which will be di&s;clo&s;ed in the &s;everal official communications that will be made to you in the cour&s;e of your deliberations.</P>
<P>The rapid &s;ub&s;criptions to the Bank of the United States, which completed the &s;um allowed to be &s;ub&s;cribed in a &s;ingle day, is among the &s;triking and plea&s;ing evidences which pre&s;ent them&s;elves, not only of confidence in the government, but of re&s;ource in the community.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="031402_0021_0FEF91B9178CC348">In the interval of your rece&s;s, due attention has been paid to the execution of the different objects which were &s;pecially provided for by the laws and re&s;olutions of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t important of the&s;e, is the defence and &s;ecurity of the We&s;tern Frontiers. To accompli&s;h it on the mo&s;t humane principles, was a primary wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Accordingly, at the &s;ame time that treaties have been provi&s;ionally concluded, and other proper means u&s;ed to attach the wavering, and to confirm in their friend&s;hip, the well-di&s;po&s;ed tribes of Indians&mdash;effectual mea&s;ures have been adopted to make tho&s;e of a ho&s;tile de&s;cription &s;en&s;i|ble, that a pacification was de&s;ired upon terms of modera|tion and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures having proved un&s;uce&s;sful, it became nece&s;&s;ary to convince the refractory of the power of the United States to puni&s;h their depredations; offen&s;ive operations have therefore been directed; to be conduct|ed, however, as con&s;i&s;tently as po&s;&s;ible with the dictates of humanity. Some of the&s;e have been crowned with full &s;ucce&s;s, and others are yet depending. The expeditions which have been completed, were carried on under the authority and at the expen&s;e of the United States, by the militia of Kentucky; who&s;e enterpri&s;e, intrepidity and good conduct are entitled to peculiar commendation.</P>
<P>Overtures of peace are &s;till continued to the deluded tribes, and con&s;iderable numbers of individuals belonging to them have lately renounced all further oppo&s;ition, re|moved from their former &s;ituations, and placed them&s;elves under the immediate protection of the United States.</P>
<P>It is &s;incerely to be de&s;ired, that all need of coercion, in future, may cea&s;e; and that an intimate intercour&s;e may &s;ucceed, calculated to advance the happine&s;s of the In|dians, and to attach them firmly to the United States.</P>
<P>In order to this, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;That they &s;hould experience the benefits of an impartial di&s;pen&s;ation of ju&s;|tice&mdash;That the mode of alienating their lands, the main &s;ource of di&s;content and war &s;hould be &s;o defined and regulated, as to obviate impo&s;ition, and, as far as may be practicable, controver&s;y, concerning the reality and extent
<PB N="42" REF="031402_0022_0FEF91BAB9372010">
of the alienations which are made&mdash;That commerce with them &s;hould be promoted under regulations tending to &s;e|cure an equitable deportment towards them, and that &s;uch rational experiments &s;hould be made, for imparting to them the ble&s;&s;ings of civilization, as may, from time to time, &s;uit their condition&mdash;That the Executive of the United States &s;hould be enabled to employ the means, to which the Indians have been long accu&s;tomed, for uniting their immediate intere&s;ts with the pre&s;ervation of peace&mdash;And that efficacious provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for inflicting ade|quate penalties upon all tho&s;e, who, by violating their rights, &s;hall infringe the treaties, and endanger the peace of the Union.</P>
<P>A &s;y&s;tem corre&s;ponding with the mild principles of re|ligion and philanthropy towards an unenlightened race of men, who&s;e happine&s;s materially depends on the conduct of the United States, would be as honourable to the na|tional character, as conformable to the dictates of &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>The powers &s;pecially ve&s;ted in me by the act, laying certain duties on di&s;tilled &s;pirits, which re&s;pect the &s;ubdi|vi&s;ions of the di&s;tricts into &s;urveys, the appointment of offi|cers, and the a&s;&s;ignment of compen&s;ations, have likewi&s;e been carried into effect. In a matter, in which both ma|terials and experience were wanting to guide the calcula|tion, it will be readily conceived that there mu&s;t have been difficulty in &s;uch an adju&s;tment of the rates of compen&s;a|tion as would conciliate a rea&s;onable competency, with a proper regard to the limits pre&s;cribed by the law. It is hoped that the circum&s;pection which has been u&s;ed will be found in the re&s;ult to have &s;ecured the la&s;t of the two objects; but it is probable, that with a view to the fir&s;t, in &s;ome in&s;tances a revi&s;ion of the provi&s;ion will be found advi&s;eable.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ions with which this law has been received by the community, have been, upon the whole, &s;uch as were to be expected among enlightened and well-di&s;po&s;ed citi|zens, from the propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure. The novelty, however, of the tax, in a con&s;iderable part of the United States, and a mi&s;conception of &s;ome of its provi|&s;ions,
<PB N="43" REF="031402_0022_0FEF91BAB9372010">
have given occa&s;ion in particular places to &s;ome de|gree of di&s;content. But it is &s;atisfactory to know, that this di&s;po&s;ition yields to proper explanations and more ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the true nature of the law. And I en|tertain a full confidence, that it will, in all, give way to motives which ari&s;e out of a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of duty, and a vir|tuous regard to the public welfare.</P>
<P>If there are any circum&s;tances, in the law, which, con|&s;i&s;tently with its main de&s;ign, may be &s;o varied as to re|move any well-intentioned objections that may happen to exi&s;t, it will con&s;i&s;t with a wi&s;e moderation to make the proper variations. It is de&s;irable, on all occa&s;ions, to unite with a &s;teady and firm adherence to con&s;titutional and ne|ce&s;&s;ary acts of government, the fulle&s;t evidence of a di&s;po|&s;ition, as far as may be practicable, to con&s;ult the wi&s;hes of every part of the community, and to lay the foundations of the public admini&s;tration in the affections of the people.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to the authority contained in the &s;everal acts on that &s;ubject, a di&s;trict of ten miles &s;quare, for the per|manent &s;eat of the government of the United States, has been fixed, and announced by proclamation; which di&s;|trict will comprehend lands on both &s;ides of the river Po|towmac, and the towns of Alexandria and Georgetown. A city has al&s;o been laid out agreeably to a plan which will be placed before Congre&s;s; and as there is a pro&s;pect favoured by the rate of &s;ales which have already taken place, of ample funds for carrying on the nece&s;&s;ary build|ings, there is every expectation of their due progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The completion of the cen&s;us of the inhabitants, for which provi&s;ion was made by a law, has been duly notifi|ed, (excepting in one in&s;tance, in which the return has been informal; and another, in which it has been omitted or mi&s;carried) and the returns of the officers who were charg|ed with this duty, which will be laid before you, will give you the plea&s;ing a&s;&s;urance, that the pre&s;ent population of the United States borders on four millions of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>It is proper al&s;o to inform you, that a further loan of two millions and an half of florins has been completed in Holland; the terms of which are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the
<PB N="44" REF="031402_0023_0FEF91C0D315A2A8">
one la&s;t announced, except as to a &s;mall reduction of charges. Another, on like terms, for &s;ix millions of flor|ins, had been &s;et on foot, under circum&s;tances that a&s;&s;ured immediate completion.</P>

<P>TWO treaties which have been provi&s;ionally concluded with the Cherokees, and Six Nations of Indians, will be laid before you for your con&s;ideration and ratification.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</P>
<P>IN entering upon the di&s;charge of your Legi&s;lative tru&s;t, you mu&s;t anticipate with plea&s;ure, that many of the diffi|culties, nece&s;&s;arily incident to the fir&s;t arrangement of a new government, for an exten&s;ive country, have been happily &s;urmounted by the zealous and judicious exertions of your predece&s;&s;ors in co-operation with the other branch of the Legi&s;lature. The important objects which remain to be accompli&s;hed, will, I am per&s;uaded, be conducted upon principles equally comprehen&s;ive, and equally well calculated for the advancement of the general weal.</P>
<P>The time limited for receiving &s;ub&s;criptions to the loans propo&s;ed by the act making provi&s;ion for the debt of the United States, having expired, &s;tatements from the proper department, will, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, apprize you of the ex|act re&s;ult. Enough, however, is already known to afford an a&s;&s;urance that the views of that act have been &s;ub&s;tantially fulfilled. The &s;ub&s;cription in the dome&s;tic debt of the United States, has embraced by far the greate&s;t propor|tion of that debt; affording at the &s;ame time, proof of the general &s;atisfaction of the public creditors with the &s;y&s;tem which has been propo&s;ed to their acceptance, and of the &s;pirit of accommodation to the convenience of the gov|ernment with which they are actuated. The &s;ub&s;criptions in the debts of the re&s;pective &s;tates, as far as the provi&s;ions of the law have permitted, may be &s;aid to be yet more general. The part of the debt of the United States which remains un&s;ub&s;cribed, will naturally engage your further deliberations.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="031402_0023_0FEF91C0D315A2A8">It is particularly plea&s;ing to me to be able to announce to you, that the revenues which have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, promi&s;e to be adequate to their objects, and may be per|mitted, if no unfore&s;een exigency occurs, to &s;uper&s;ede, for the pre&s;ent, the nece&s;&s;ity of any new burthens upon our con&s;tituents.</P>

<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE, AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</P>
<P>I SHALL content my&s;elf with a general reference to former communications for &s;everal objects, upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto po&s;tponed any defin|itive re&s;olution. Their importance will recal them to your attention; and I tru&s;t that the progre&s;s already made in the mo&s;t arduous arrangements of the government will af|ford you lei&s;ure to re&s;ume them with advantage.</P>
<P>There are, however, &s;ome of them of which I cannot forbear a more particular mention; the&s;e are, the Militia &mdash;The Po&s;t-Office and Po&s;t-Roads&mdash;The Mint&mdash;Weights and Mea&s;ures&mdash;a Provi&s;ion for the Sale of the Vacant Lands of the United States.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is certainly an object of primary importance, whether viewed in reference to the national &s;ecurity, to the &s;atisfaction of the community, or the pre&s;ervation of order. In connexion with this, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of com|petent magazines and ar&s;enals, and the fortification of &s;uch places as are peculiarly important and vulnerable, naturally pre&s;ent them&s;elves to con&s;ideration. The &s;afety of the United States, under divine protection, ought to re&s;t on the ba&s;is of &s;y&s;tematic and &s;olid arrangement; expo&s;ed as little as po&s;&s;ible to the hazards of fortuitous circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The importance of the Po&s;t-Office and Po&s;t Roads, on a plan &s;ufficiently liberal and comprehen&s;ive, as they re|&s;pect
<PB N="46" REF="031402_0024_0FEF91C48EEDB378">
the expedition, &s;afety and facility of communication, is increa&s;ed by the in&s;trumentality in diffu&s;ing a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the government; which, while it contributes to the &s;ecurity of the people, &s;erves al&s;o to guard them again&s;t the effects of mi&s;repre&s;entation and mi&s;conception. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of additional cro&s;s po&s;ts, e&s;pecially to &s;ome of the important points in the we&s;tern and northern parts of the Union, cannot fail to be of material utility.</P>
<P>The di&s;orders in the exi&s;ting currency, and e&s;pecially the &s;carcity of &s;mall change, a &s;carcity &s;o peculiarly di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing to the poorer cla&s;&s;es, &s;trongly recommend the carrying into immediate effect the re&s;olution already en|tered into concerning the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Mint. Mea&s;|ures have been taken pur&s;uant to that re&s;olution for pro|curing &s;ome of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary articles, together with the requi&s;ite apparatus.</P>
<P>An uniformity in the weights and mea&s;ures of the coun|try is among the important objects &s;ubmitted to you by the Con&s;titution, and if it can be derived from a &s;tandard at once invariable and univer&s;al, mu&s;t be no le&s;s honourable to the public councils than conducive to the public conve|nience.</P>
<P>A provi&s;ion for the &s;ale of the vacant lands of the Uni|ted States, is particularly urged, among other rea&s;ons, by the important con&s;iderations&mdash;that they are pledged as a fund for reimbur&s;ing the public debt;&mdash;that if timely and judiciou&s;ly applied, they may &s;ave the nece&s;&s;ity of burthen|ing our citizens with new taxes for the extingui&s;hment of the principal; and that being free to di&s;charge the princi|pal, but in a limited proportion, no opportunity ought to be lo&s;t for availing the public of its rights.</P>

<P>THE Senate of the United States have received with much &s;atisfaction the a&s;&s;urance of public pro&s;perity contained in your &s;peech to both Hou&s;es. The multiplied ble&s;&s;ings of Providence have not e&s;caped our notice, or failed to excite our gratitude.</P>
<P>The benefits which flow from the re&s;toration of public and private confidence, are con&s;picuous and important; and the plea&s;ure with which we contemplate them is heigh|tened by your a&s;&s;urance of tho&s;e farther communications, which &s;hall confirm their exi&s;tence, and indicate their &s;ource.</P>

Our &s;olicitude to obtain, will en&s;ure our zealous attention to an object &s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;ed by the dictates of benev|olence, and &s;o highly intere&s;ting to the honour and welfare of the nation.</P>
<P>The &s;everal &s;ubjects which you have particularly recom|mended, and tho&s;e which remain of former &s;e&s;&s;ions, will engage our early con&s;ideration. We are encouraged to pre&s;ecute them with alacrity and &s;teadine&s;s, by the belief, that they will intere&s;t no pa&s;&s;ion but that for the general welfare, by the a&s;&s;urance of concert, and by a view of tho&s;e arduous and important arrangements which have been al|ready accompli&s;hed.</P>

<P>IN receiving your addre&s;s at the opening of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives have taken an ample &s;hare in the feelings in&s;pired by the actual pro&s;perity and flattering pro&s;pects of our country; and whil&s;t, with be|coming gratitude to Heaven, we a&s;cribe this happine&s;s to the true &s;ource from which it flows, we behold with ani|mating plea&s;ure, the degree in which the con&s;titution and laws of the United States have been in&s;trumental in di&s;|pen&s;ing it.</P>
<P>It yields us particular &s;atisfaction to learn the &s;ucce&s;s with which the different important mea&s;ures of the gov|ernment have proceeded; as well tho&s;e &s;pecially provided for at the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, as tho&s;e of preceding date.</P>

being peculiarly intere&s;ting, your communications on that &s;ubject are proportionably grateful to us.</P>
<P>The gallantry and good conduct of the militia, who&s;e &s;ervices were called for, is an honourable confirmation of the efficacy of that precious re&s;ource of a free &s;tate; and we anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h, that the con&s;equences of their &s;ucce&s;s|ful enterprizes, and of the other proceedings to which you have referred, may leave the United States free to pur&s;ue the mo&s;t benevolent policy towards the unhappy and delu|ded race of people in our neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The amount of the population of the United States, deter|mined by the returns of the cen&s;us, is a &s;ource of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing reflections, whether it be viewed in relation to our na|tional &s;afety and re&s;pectabllity, or as a proof of that felicity in the &s;ituation of our country, which favours &s;o unexampled a rapidity in its growth: nor ought any to be in&s;en&s;ible to the additional motives &s;ugge&s;ted by this important fact, to perpetuate the free government e&s;tabli&s;hed, with a wi&s;e ad|mini&s;tration of it, to a portion of the earth which promi&s;es &s;uch an increa&s;e of the number which is to enjoy the&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings within the limits of the United States.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE, AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is &s;ome abatement of the &s;atisfaction, with which I meet you on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national pro&s;perity, generally, I am not able to add to it information that the Indian ho&s;til|ities, which have, for &s;ome time pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed our north&punc; we&s;tern frontier, have terminated.</P>
<P>You will, I am per&s;uaded learn, with no le&s;s concern than I communicate it, that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto i&s;&s;ued only in new and outrageous proofs of per&s;evering ho&s;tility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in conte&s;t. An earne&s;t de&s;ire to procure tranquillity to the frontiers&mdash;to &s;top the further effu&s;ion of blood&mdash;to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of expen&s;e&mdash;to forward the prevalent wi&s;h of the nation, for peace, has led to &s;trenuous efforts, through various chan|nels, to accompli&s;h the&s;e de&s;irable purpo&s;es; in making which efforts, I con&s;ulted le&s;s my own anticipations of the event, or the &s;cruples which &s;ome con&s;iderations were cal|culated to in&s;pire, than the wi&s;h to find the object attaina|ble; or if not attainable, to a&s;certain, unequivocally, that &s;uch is the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>A detail of the mea&s;ures which have been pur&s;ued, and of their con&s;equences, which will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you the want of &s;ucce&s;s, thus far, will, I tru&s;t, evince that means, as proper and as efficacious as could have been devi&s;ed, have been employed. The i&s;&s;ue of &s;ome of them, indeed, is &s;till depending; but a favour|able one, though not to be de&s;paired of, is not promi&s;ed by any thing that has yet happened.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="031402_0027_0FEF91CB70248A08">In the cour&s;e of the attempts which have been made, &s;ome valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public &s;ervice. A &s;anction commonly re&s;pected, even among &s;avages, has been found, in this in&s;tance, in&s;ufficient to protect from ma&s;&s;acre, the emi&s;&s;aries of peace; it will, I pre&s;ume, be duly con&s;idered, whether the occa&s;ion does not call for an exerci&s;e of liberality towards the families of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t add to your concern, to be informed that be&s;ides the continuation of ho&s;tile appearances, among the tribes north of the Ohio, &s;ome threatening &s;ymptoms have of late been revived among &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;outh of it.</P>
<P>A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chick|amagas, inhabiting five villages on the Tenne&s;&s;ee river, have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>It was hoped that the treaty of <HI>Hol&s;ton,</HI> made with the Cherokee nation, in July, 1791, would have prevented a repetition of &s;uch depredations. But the event has not an|&s;wered this hope The Chickamagas, aided by &s;ome banditti of another tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked ho&s;tilities upon the citizens of the United States, in that quarter. The information which has been received on this &s;ubject will be laid before you. Hitherto defen&s;ive precautions, only have been &s;trictly enjoined and ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>It is not under&s;tood that any breach of treaty, or aggre&s;|&s;on what&s;oever, on the part of the United States, or their citizens, is even alleged as a pretext for the &s;pirit of ho&s;tility in this quarter.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to believe, that every practicable exertion has been made, (pur&s;uant to the provi&s;ion by law for that purpo&s;e) to be prepared for the alternative of a pro&s;ecution of the war, in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops, authorized to be rai&s;ed, have been recruited, though the number is &s;till incomplete; and pains have been taken to di&s;cipline, and put them in condition for the particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind of &s;ervice to be performed. A delay of operations (be&s;ides being dictated by the mea&s;ures which were pur&s;uing towards a pacific termina|tion
<PB N="53" REF="031402_0027_0FEF91CB70248A08">
of the war) has been in it&s;elf deemed preferable to im|mature efforts. A &s;tatement, from the proper department, with regard to the number of troops rai&s;ed, and &s;ome other points which have been &s;ugge&s;ted, will afford more preci&s;e information, as a guide to the legi&s;lative con&s;ultations; and among other things, will enable Congre&s;s to judge whether &s;ome additional &s;timulus to the recruiting &s;ervice may not be advi&s;eable.</P>
<P>In looking forward to the future expen&s;e of the opera|tions, which may be found inevitable, I derive con&s;olation from the information I receive, that the product of the revenues for the pre&s;ent year, is likely to &s;upercede the nece&s;&s;ity of additional burthens on the community, for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year. This, however, will be better a&s;certained in the cour&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and it is proper to add, that the information alluded to proceeds from the &s;uppo&s;ition of no material exten&s;ion of the &s;pirit of ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject of Indian affairs, without again recommending to your con&s;ideration the expediency of more adequate provi&s;ion for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for re&s;training the commi&s;&s;ion of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans mu&s;t prove nugatory To enable, by com|petent rewards, the employment of qualified and tru&s;ty per&s;ons to re&s;ide among them, as agents, would al&s;o con|tribute to the pre&s;ervation of peace and good neighbour|hood. If in addition to the&s;e expedients, an eligible plan could be devi&s;ed for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes, and for carrying on trade with them upon a &s;cale equal to their wants, and under regulations calcu|lated to protect them from impo&s;ition and extortion, its influence in cementing their intere&s;ts with ours could not but be con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The pro&s;perous &s;tate of our revenue has been intimated. This would be &s;till more the ca&s;e, were it not for the im|pediments which in &s;ome places continue to embarra&s;s the collection of the duties on &s;pirits, di&s;tilled within the United States. The&s;e impediments have le&s;&s;ened, and are le&s;&s;ening in local extent; and, as applied to the com|munity
<PB N="54" REF="031402_0028_0FEF91D366664AB0">
at large, the contentment with the law appears to be progre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>But &s;ymptoms of increa&s;ed oppo&s;ition having lately manife&s;ted them&s;elves in certain quarters, I judged &s;pecial interpo&s;ition on my part, proper and advi&s;eable; and under this impre&s;&s;ion have i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation, warning again&s;t all unlawful combinations and proceedings, having for their object, or tending to ob&s;truct the operation of the law in que&s;tion, and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be &s;trictly put in execution, for bringing to ju&s;tice the infractors thereof, and &s;ecuring obedience thereto.</P>
<P>Mea&s;ures have al&s;o been taken for the pro&s;ecution of of|fenders. And Congre&s;s may be a&s;&s;ured, that nothing within con&s;titutional and legal limits, which may depend on me, &s;hall be wanting to a&s;&s;ert and maintain the ju&s;t authority of the laws. In fulfilling this tru&s;t, I &s;hall count entirely upon the full co-operation of the other departments of the government, and upon the zealous &s;upport of all good citizens.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legi&s;lature, the &s;ubject of a revi&s;ion of the judiciary &s;y&s;tem. A repre&s;entation from the Judges of the Supreme Court, which will be laid before you, points out &s;ome of the in|conveniences that are experienced. In the cour&s;e of the execution of the laws, con&s;iderations ri&s;e out of the &s;truc|ture of that &s;y&s;tem, which in &s;ome ca&s;es tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this &s;ubject, provi&s;ions to facilitate the taking of bail upon proce&s;&s;es out of the courts of the United States, and &s;upplementary definition of offences again&s;t the con&s;titution and laws of the Union, and of the puni&s;hment for &s;uch offences, will, it is pre|&s;umed, be found worthy of particular attention.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervations on the value of peace with other nations are unnece&s;&s;ary. It would be wi&s;e, however, by timely provi&s;ions, to guard again&s;t tho&s;e acts of our own citizens, which might tend to di&s;turb it, and to put our&s;elves in a condition to give that &s;atisfaction to foreign nations, which we may &s;ometimes have occa&s;ion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your con&s;ideration the means of preventing tho&s;e aggre&s;&s;ions by our citizens on the ter|ritory
<PB N="55" REF="031402_0028_0FEF91D366664AB0">
of other nations, and other infractions of the law of nations, which furni&s;hes ju&s;t &s;ubject of complaint, and might endanger our peace with them. And, in general, the maintenance of a friendly intercour&s;e with foreign pow|ers will be pre&s;ented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpo&s;e, which takes place, if not renew|ed, at the clo&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In execution of the authority given by the legi&s;lature, mea&s;ures have been taken for engaging &s;ome arti&s;ts from abroad to aid in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our mint: others have been employed at home. Provi&s;ion has been made of the requi&s;ite buildings, and the&s;e are now putting into prop|er condition for the purpo&s;es of the e&s;tabli&s;hment. There has al&s;o been a &s;mall beginning in the coinage of half dimes; the want of &s;mall coins in circulation calling the fir&s;t attention to them.</P>
<P>The regulation of foreign coins, in corre&s;pondency with the principles of our national coinage, as being e&s;&s;ential to their due operation, and to order in our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be re&s;umed and completed.</P>
<P>It is repre&s;ented that &s;ome provi&s;ions in the law, which e&s;tabli&s;hes the po&s;t-office, operate, in experiment, again&s;t the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of new&s;papers, to di&s;tant parts of the coun|try. Should this, upon due inquiry, be found to be the fact, a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information, will, I doubt not, lead to the application of a remedy.</P>
<P>The adoption of a con&s;titution for the State of <HI>Kentucky,</HI> has been notified to me. The legi&s;lature will &s;hare with me in the &s;atisfaction which ari&s;es from an event, intere&s;t|ing to the happine&s;s of the part of the nation to which it relates, and conducive to the general order.</P>
<P>It is proper likewi&s;e to inform you, that &s;ince my la&s;t communication on the &s;ubject, and in further execution of the acts, &s;everally making provi&s;ion for the public debt, and for the reduction thereof, three new loans have been effect|ed, each for three millions of florins; one at Antwerp, at the annual intere&s;t of four and one half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charges; and the other two at Am&s;terdam, at the annual intere&s;t of four
<PB N="56" REF="031402_0029_0FEF91D4EFEAB558">
per cent. with an allowance of five and one half per cent&punc; in one ca&s;e, and of five per cent. in the other, in lieu of all charges. The rates of the&s;e loans, and the circum|&s;tances under which they have been made, are confirma|tions of the high &s;tate of our credit abroad.</P>
<P>Among the objects to which the&s;e funds have been di|rected to be applied, the payment of the debts due to cer|tain foreign officers, according to the provi&s;ion made du|ring the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, has been embraced.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</P>
<P>I ENTERTAIN a &s;trong hope, that the &s;tate of the national finances is now &s;ufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a &s;y&s;tematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and di&s;charge of the public debt, according to the right which has been re&s;erved to the gov|ernment. No mea&s;ure can be more de&s;irable, whether view|ed with an eye to its intrin&s;ic importance, or to the general &s;entiment and wi&s;h of the nation.</P>

<P>ACCEPT, Sir, our grateful acknowledgments for your addre&s;s at the opening of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion. We participate with you in the &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from the con|tinuance of the general pro&s;perity of the nation; but it is not without the mo&s;t &s;incere concern that we are informed, that the reiterated efforts which have been made to e&s;tab|li&s;h peace with the ho&s;tile Indians have hitherto failed to accompli&s;h that de&s;ired effect. Hoping that the mea&s;ures &s;till depending may prove more &s;ucce&s;sful than tho&s;e which have preceded them, we &s;hall neverthele&s;s concur in every nece&s;&s;ary preparation for the alternative; and, &s;hould the Indians on either &s;ide of the Ohio per&s;i&s;t in their ho&s;tilities, fidelity to the Union, as well as affection for our fellow-cit|izens on the frontiers, will en&s;ure our decided co-operation in every mea&s;ure, which &s;hall be deemed requi&s;ite for their protection and &s;afety.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat we avow the obligation of the gov|ernment to afford its protection to every part of the U|nion, we cannot refrain from expre&s;&s;ing our regret, that even a &s;mall portion of our fellow-citizens in any quarter of it, &s;hould have combined to oppo&s;e the operation of the law for the collection of duties on &s;pirits di&s;tilled within the United States; a law repeatedly &s;anctioned by the author|ity of the nation, and at this juncture materially connect|ed

<P>It yields us particular plea&s;ure to learn, that the pro|ductivene&s;s of the revenue of the pre&s;ent year, will proba|bly &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of any additional tax for the &s;ervice of the next.</P>
<P>The organization of the government of the State of <HI>Ken|tucky,</HI> being an event peculiarly intere&s;ting to a part of our fellow-citizens, and conducive to the general order, affords us peculiar &s;atisfaction.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, who always feel &s;atisfaction in meeting you, are much concerned that the occa&s;ion for mutual felicitation, afforded by circum&s;tances favourable to the national pro&s;perity, &s;hould be abated by a continuance of the ho&s;tile &s;pirit of many of the Indian tribes; and particularly, that the reiterated efforts for ef|fecting a general pacification with them, &s;hould have i&s;&s;u|ed in new proofs of their per&s;evering enmity, and the bar|barous &s;acrifice of citizens who, as the me&s;&s;engers of peace, were di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves by their zeal for the public &s;ervice. In our deliberations on this important depart|ment of our affairs, we &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to pur&s;ue every mea&s;ure that may be dictated by the &s;incere&s;t de&s;ire on one hand, of cultivating peace, and manife&s;ting, by every prac|ticable regulation, our benevolent regard for the welfare of tho&s;e mi&s;guided people; and by the duty we feel, on the other, to provide effectually for the &s;afety and protec|tion of our fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>While with regret we learn, that &s;ymptoms of oppo&s;ition to the law impo&s;ing duties on &s;pirits di&s;tilled within the Uni|ted States, have manife&s;ted them&s;elves, we reflect, with con|&s;olation, that they are confined to a &s;mall portion of our fellow-citizens. It is not more e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of true liberty, that a government &s;hould be always ready to li&s;ten to the repre&s;entations of its con&s;tituents, and to ac|comodate its mea&s;ures to the &s;entiments and wi&s;hes of eve|ry part of them, as far as will con&s;i&s;t with the good of the whole, than it is, that the ju&s;t authority of the laws &s;hould be &s;tedfa&s;tly maintained.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="031402_0031_0FEF91D9AC1A2558">Under this impre&s;&s;ion, every department of the govern|ment, and all good citizens, mu&s;t approve the mea&s;ures you have taken, and the purpo&s;e you have formed, to execute this part of your tru&s;t with firmne&s;s and energy; and be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, of every con&s;titutional aid and co-operation which may become requi&s;ite on our part. And we hope, that while the progre&s;s of contentment under the law in que&s;tion, is as obvious as it is rational, no particular part of the community may be permitted to withdraw from the general burthens of the country, by a conduct as irrecon|cileable to national ju&s;tice, as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with public decency.</P>
<P>The productive &s;tate of the public revenue, and the con|firmation of the credit of the United States abroad, evin|ced by the loans at <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> are communi|cations the more gratifying, as they enforce the obligation to enter on &s;y&s;tematic and effectual arrangements for di&s;|charging the public debt, as far as the conditions of it will permit. And we take plea&s;ure in the opportunity to a&s;&s;ure you of our entire concurrence in the opinion, that no mea&s;ure can be more de&s;ireable, whether viewed with an eye to the urgent wi&s;h of the community, or the intrin&s;ic importance of promoting &s;o happy a change in our &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The adoption of a con&s;titution for the State of <HI>Kentucky,</HI> is an event in which we join in all the &s;atisfaction you have expre&s;&s;ed. It may be con&s;idered as particularly intere&s;ting, &s;ince, be&s;ides the immediate benefits re&s;ulting from it, it is another au&s;picious demon&s;tration of the facility and &s;ucce&s;s with which an enlightened people are capable of providing, by free and deliberate plans of government, for their own &s;afety and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The operation of the law e&s;tabli&s;hing the Po&s;t-Office, as it relates to the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of new&s;papers, will merit our particular inquiry and attention; the circulation of polit|ical intelligence, through the&s;e vehicles, being ju&s;tly reck|oned among the &s;ure&s;t means of preventing the degeneracy of a free government, as well as of recommending every &s;alutary public mea&s;ure, to the confidence and co-operation of all virtuous citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="031402_0031_0FEF91D9AC1A2558">The &s;everal other matters which you have communicated and recommended, will in their order receive the attention due to them; and our di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will, in all ca&s;es, we tru&s;t, be guided by a proper re&s;pect for harmony and &s;tability in the public councils, and a de&s;ire to conciliate more and more, the attachment of our con&s;tituents to the con&s;titu|tion, by mea&s;ures accommodated to the true ends for which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE, AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE the commencement of the term, for which I have been again called into office, no &s;it occa&s;ion has ari&s;|en for expre&s;&s;ing to my fellow-citizens at large, the deep and re&s;pectful &s;en&s;e, which I feel, of the renewed te&s;timony of public approbation. While on the one hand, it awa|kened my gratitude for all tho&s;e in&s;tances of affectionate partiality, with which I have been honoured by my coun|try; on the other, it could not prevent an earne&s;t wi&s;h for that retirement, from which no private con&s;ideration &s;hould ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief, that my con|duct would be e&s;timated according to its real motives; and that the people, and the authorities derived from them, would &s;upport exertions, having nothing per&s;onal for their object, I have obeyed the &s;uffrage which commanded me to re&s;ume the executive power; and I humbly implore that Being, on who&s;e will the fate of nations depends, to crown with &s;ucce&s;s our mutual endeavours for the general hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the war in Europe had embraced tho&s;e pow|ers with whom the United States have the mo&s;t exten&s;ive relation; there was rea&s;on to apprehend that our inter|cour&s;e with them might be interrupted, and our di&s;po&s;ition for peace, drawn into que&s;tion, by the &s;u&s;picions, too often entertained by belligerent nations. It &s;eemed therefore to be my duty, to admoni&s;h our citizens of the con&s;equen|ces of a contraband trade, and of ho&s;tile acts to any of the parties; and to obtain, by a declaration of the exi&s;ting le|gal &s;tate of things, an ea&s;ier admi&s;&s;ion of our rights to the immunities, belonging to our &s;ituation. Under the&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="63" REF="031402_0032_0FEF91DD59DC4128">
the proclamation, which will be laid before you, was i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>In this po&s;ture of affairs, both new and delicate, I re&s;olv|ed to adopt general rules which &s;hould conform to the treaties, and a&s;&s;ert the privileges of the United States. The&s;e were reduced into a &s;y&s;tem, which will be commu|nicated to you. Although I have not thought my&s;elf at liberty to forbid the &s;ale of the prizes, permitted by our treaty of commerce with France to be brought into our ports; I have not refu&s;ed to cau&s;e them to be re&s;tored, when they were taken within the protection of our territo|ry; or by ve&s;&s;els commi&s;&s;ioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the United States.</P>
<P>It re&s;ts with the wi&s;dom of Congre&s;s to correct, improve or enforce this plan of procedure, and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code, and the juri&s;|diction of the Courts of the United States, to many ca&s;es which, though dependent on principles already recognized, demand &s;ome further provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>When individuals &s;hall, within the United States, array them&s;elves in ho&s;tility again&s;t any of the powers at war; or enter upon military expeditions, or enterprizes within the juri&s;diction of the United States; or u&s;urp and exer|ci&s;e judicial authority within the United States; or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indi&s;tinctly marked, or are inadequate; the&s;e offences cannot receive too early and clo&s;e an attention, and re|quire prompt and deci&s;ive remedies.</P>
<P>What&s;oever tho&s;e remedies may be, they will be well admini&s;tered by the Judiciary, who po&s;&s;e&s;s a long e&s;tabli&s;h|ed cour&s;e of inve&s;tigation, effectual proce&s;s, and officers in the habit of executing it. In like manner, as &s;everal of the courts have <HI>doubted,</HI> under particular circum&s;tances, their power to liberate the ve&s;&s;els of a nation at peace, and even of a citizen of the United States, although &s;eized under a fal&s;e colour of being ho&s;tile property; and have <HI>denied</HI> their power to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory; it would &s;eem proper to regulate their juri&s;diction in the&s;e points. But if the Executive is to be the re&s;ort in either of the two la&s;t mentioned ca&s;es, it is
<PB N="64" REF="031402_0033_0FEF91E0B9C8C538">
hoped, that he will be authorized by law, to have facts a&s;certained by the courts, when, for his own information, he &s;hall reque&s;t it.</P>
<P>I cannot recommend to your notice mea&s;ures for the fulfilment of <HI>our</HI> duties to the re&s;t of the world, without again pre&s;&s;ing upon you the nece&s;&s;ity of placing our&s;elves in a condition of complete defence, and of exacting from <HI>them</HI> the fulfilment of <HI>their</HI> duties towards <HI>us.</HI> The United States ought not to indulge a per&s;ua&s;ion, that, contrary to the order of human events, they will forever keep at a di&s;tance tho&s;e painful appeals to arms with which the hi&s;tory of every other nation abounds. There is a rank due to the United States among nations; which will be withheld, if not ab&s;olutely lo&s;t, by the reputation of weak|ne&s;s. If we de&s;ire to avoid in&s;ult, we mu&s;t be able to repel it; if we de&s;ire to &s;ecure peace, one of the mo&s;t powerful in&s;truments of our ri&s;ing pro&s;perity, it mu&s;t be known, that we are at all times ready for war.</P>
<P>The documents which will be pre&s;ented to you, will &s;hew the amount, and kinds of arms and military &s;tores now in our magazines and ar&s;enals; and yet an addition even to the&s;e &s;upplies cannot with prudence be neglected; as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger. Not can &s;uch arrangements, with &s;uch objects, be expo&s;ed to the cen&s;ure or jealou&s;y of the warme&s;t friends of republican government. They are incapable of abu&s;e in the hands of the militia, who ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s a pride in being the depo&s;|itory of the force of the Republic, and may be trained to a degree of energy, equal to every military exigency of the United States. But it is an inquiry, which cannot be too &s;olemnly pur&s;ued, whether the act, "more effectually to provide for the national defence by e&s;tabli&s;hing an uniform militia throughout the United States," has organized them &s;o as to produce their full effect; whether your own ex|perience in the &s;everal States has not detected &s;ome imper|fections in the &s;cheme; and whether a material feature in an improvement of it, ought not to be to afford an oppor|tunity for the &s;tudy of tho&s;e branches of the military art, which can &s;carcely ever be attained by practice alone?</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="031402_0033_0FEF91E0B9C8C538">The connexion of the United States with Europe, has become extremely intere&s;ting. The occurrences which relate to it, and have pa&s;&s;ed under the knowledge of the Executive, will be exhibited to Congre&s;s in a &s;ub&s;equent communication.</P>
<P>When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmed that every rea&s;onable effort has been made to adju&s;t the cau&s;es of di&s;&s;en&s;ion with the Indians, north of the Ohio. The in&s;tructions given to the commi&s;&s;ioners evince a moderation and equity, proceeding from a &s;incere love of peace, and a liberality having no re&s;triction but the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts and dignity of the United States. The attempt, however, of an amicable negociation having been fru&s;trated, the troops have marched to act offen&s;ively. Al|though the propo&s;ed treaty did not arre&s;t the progre&s;s of military preparation, it is doubtful, how, far the advance of the &s;ea&s;on, before good faith ju&s;tified active movements, may retard them, during the remainder of the year. From the papers and intelligence which relate to this important &s;ubject, you will determine, whether the deficiency in the number of troops, granted by law, &s;hall be compen&s;ated by &s;uccours of militia; or additional encouragements &s;hall be propo&s;ed to recruits. An anxiety has been al&s;o demon|&s;trated by the Executive, for peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn and with cloathing, and offen&s;ive mea&s;ures again&s;t them prohibited, during the rece&s;s of Congre&s;s. To &s;atisfy the complaints of the latter, pro&s;ecutions have been in&s;tituted for the violences committed upon them. But the papers, which will be delivered to you, di&s;clo&s;e the critical foot|ing on which we &s;tand in regard to both tho&s;e tribes, and it is with Congre&s;s to pronounce what &s;hall be done.</P>
<P>After they &s;hall have provided for the pre&s;ent emer|gency, it will merit their mo&s;t ferious labours, to render tranquillity with the &s;avages, permanent, by creating ties of intere&s;t. Next to a rigorous execution of ju&s;tice on the violators of peace, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States, is mo&s;t like|ly to conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion, with con&s;tant
<PB N="66" REF="031402_0034_0FEF91E4538C6500">
and plentiful &s;upplies, with a ready market for the com|modities of the Indians, and a &s;tated price for what they give in payment, and receive in exchange. Individuals will not pur&s;ue &s;uch a traffic, unle&s;s they be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to be reimbur&s;ed only. Should this recommenda|tion accord with the opinion of Congre&s;s, they will recol|lect, that it cannot be accompli&s;hed by any means yet in the hands of the Executive.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</P>
<P>THE commi&s;&s;ioners, charged with the &s;ettlement of accounts between the United and individual States, con|cluded their important functions, within the time limited by law; and the balances, &s;truck in their report, which will be laid before Congre&s;s, have been placed on the books of the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t day of June la&s;t, an in&s;tallment of one mil|lion of florins became payable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adju&s;ted by a prolongation of the period of reimbur&s;ement, in the nature of a new loan, at intere&s;t at five per cent, for the term of ten years; and the expen&s;es of this operation were a commi&s;&s;ion of three per cent.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tallment of the loan of two millions of dol|lars from the bank of the United States, has been paid, as was directed by law. For the &s;econd, it is nece&s;&s;ary that provi&s;ion &s;hould be made.</P>
<P>No pecuniary con&s;ideration is more urgent, than the regular redemption and di&s;charge of the public debt; on none, can delay be more injurious, or an economy of time more valuable.</P>
<P>The productivene&s;s of the public revenues hitherto, has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it; but it is not expected to prove commen&s;urate with all the objects which have been &s;ugge&s;ted. Some auxiliary provi&s;ions will, therefore, it is pre&s;umed, be requi&s;ite; and it is hoped that the&s;e may be made, con&s;i&s;tently with a due regard to the convenience of our citizens, who cannot but
<PB N="67" REF="031402_0034_0FEF91E4538C6500">
be &s;en&s;ible of the true wi&s;dom of encountering a &s;mall pre&s;ent addition to their contribution, to obviate a future accumulation of burdens.</P>
<P>But here I cannot forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the tran&s;portation of public prints. There is no re&s;ource &s;o firm for the government of the United States, as the affections of the people, guided by an en|lightened policy; and to this primary good, nothing can produce more, than a faithful repre&s;entation of public proceedings, diffu&s;ed without re&s;traint, throughout the United States.</P>
<P>An e&s;timate of the appropriations, nece&s;&s;ary for the cur|rent &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, and a &s;tatement of a pur|cha&s;e of arms and military &s;tores, made during the rece&s;s, will be pre&s;ented to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE, AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</P>
<P>THE &s;everal &s;ubjects, to which I have now referred, open a wide range to your deliberations; and involve &s;ome of the choice&s;t intere&s;ts of our common country.

Without an unprejudiced coolne&s;s, the welfare of the government may be hazarded; without harmony, as far as con&s;i&s;ts with freedom of &s;entiment, its dignity may be lo&s;t. But as the legi&s;lative proceedings of the United States will never, I tru&s;t, be reproached for the want of temper or of candour; &s;o &s;hall not the public happine&s;s langui&s;h, from the want of my &s;trenuous and warme&s;t co|operations.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Repre&s;entatives of the people of the United States, in meeting you for the fir&s;t time &s;ince you have been again called by an unanimous &s;uffrage to your pre&s;ent &s;tation, find an occa&s;ion which they embrace with no le&s;s &s;incerity than promptitude, for expre&s;&s;ing to you their congratulations on &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a te&s;timony of public approbation, and their entire confidence in the purity and patrioti&s;m of the motives which have produced this obedience to the voice of your country. It is to virtues which have commanded long and univer&s;al reverence, and &s;ervices from which have flowed great and la&s;ting benefits, that the tribute of prai&s;e may be paid without the reproach of flattery; and it is from the &s;ame &s;ources that the faire&s;t anticipations may be derived in favour of the public happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The United States having taken no part in the war which has embraced in Europe the power with whom they have the mo&s;t exten&s;ive relations, the maintenance of peace was ju&s;tly to be regarded as one of the mo&s;t important du|ties of the Magi&s;trate charged with the faithful execution of the laws. We accordingly witne&s;s with approbation and plea&s;ure the vigilance with which you have guarded again&s;t an interruption of that ble&s;&s;ing, by your Proclama|tion,
<PB N="70" REF="031402_0036_0FEF91E98FEB0AF0">
admoni&s;hing our citizens of the con&s;equences of illi|cit or ho&s;tile acts towards the belligerent parties; and pro|moting, by a declaration of the exi&s;ting legal &s;tate of things, an ea&s;ier admi&s;&s;ion of our right to the immunities belong|ing to our &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The connexion of the United States with Europe has evidently become extremely intere&s;ting. The communi|cations which remain to be exhibited to us, will, no doubt, a&s;&s;i&s;t in giving us a fuller view of the &s;ubject, and in guid|ing our deliberations to &s;uch re&s;ults as may comport with the rights and true intere&s;ts of our country.</P>
<P>We learn with deep regret that the mea&s;ures dictated by a love of peace for obtaining an amicable termination of the afflicting war on our frontier &s;hould have been fru&s;trated, and that a re&s;ort to offen&s;ive mea&s;ures &s;hould have again be|come nece&s;&s;ary. As the latter, however, mu&s;t be rendered more &s;atisfactory in proportion to the &s;olicitude for peace manife&s;ted by the former, it is to be hoped, they will be pur&s;ued under the better au&s;pices on that account, and be finally crowned with more happy &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In relation to the particular tribes of Indians, again&s;t whom offen&s;ive mea&s;ures have been prohibited, as well as on all the other important &s;ubjects which you have pre&s;ent|ed to our view, we &s;hall be&s;tow the attention which they claim. We cannot, however, refrain at this time, from particularly expre&s;&s;ing our concurrence in your anxiety for the regular di&s;charge of the public debts, as fa&s;t as circum|&s;tances and events will permit; and in the policy of remo|ving any impediments that may be found in the way of a faithful repre&s;entation of public proceedings throughout the United States, being per&s;uaded with you, that on no &s;ubject more than the former, can delay be more injurious, or an economy of time more valuable, and that with re&s;pect to the latter, no re&s;ource is &s;o firm for the government of the United States, as the affections of the people, guid|ed by an enlightened policy.</P>
<P>Throughout our deliberations we &s;hall endeavour to cheri&s;h every &s;entiment which may contribute to render them conducive to the dignity, as well as to the welfare of the United States; and we join with you in imploring that Being, on who&s;e will the fate of nations depends, to crown with &s;ucce&s;s our mutual endeavours.</P>

<P>I SHALL not affect to conceal the cordial &s;atisfaction which I derive from the addre&s;s of the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives. What&s;oever tho&s;e &s;ervices may be which you have &s;anctioned by your favour, it is a &s;ufficient reward, that they have been accepted, as they were meant. For the fulfilment of your anticipations of the future, I can give no other a&s;&s;urance, than that the motives, which you ap|prove, &s;hall continue unchanged.</P>
<P>It is truly gratifying to me, to learn, that the Procla|mation has been con&s;idered as a &s;ea&s;onable guard again&s;t the interruption of the public peace. Nor can I doubt, that the &s;ubjects which I have recommended to your at|tention, as depending upon legi&s;lative provi&s;ions, will re|ceive a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;uited to their importance. With eve|ry rea&s;on, then, it may be expected, that your deliberations, under the Divine ble&s;&s;ing, will be matured to the honour and happine&s;s of the United States.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE, AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN we call to mind the gracious indulgence of Heaven, by which the American People became a nation; when we &s;urvey the general pro&s;perity of our country, and look forward to the riches, power and happine&s;s, to which it &s;eems de&s;tined; with the deepe&s;t regret do I announce to you, that during your rece&s;s, &s;ome of the citizens of the United States have been found capable of an in&s;urrection. It is due, however, to the character of our government, and to its &s;tability, which cannot be &s;haken by the enemies of or|der, freely to unfold the cour&s;e of this event.</P>
<P>During the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the year 1790, it was expedient to exerci&s;e the legi&s;lative power granted by the con&s;titution of the United States, "to lay and collect exci&s;es." In a ma|jority of the States, &s;carcely an objection was heard to this mode of taxation. In &s;ome, indeed, alarms were at fir&s;t conceived, until they were bani&s;hed by rea&s;on and patriot|i&s;m. In the four we&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania, a prej|udice, fo&s;tered and embittered by the artifice of men who laboured for an a&s;cendency over the will of others, by the guidance of their pa&s;&s;ions, produced &s;ymptoms of riot and violence. It is well known, that Congre&s;s did not he&s;itate to examine the complaints which were pre&s;ented, and to relieve them, as far as ju&s;tice dictated, or general convenience would permit. But the impre&s;&s;ion which this moderation made on the di&s;contented did not corre&s;pond with what it de&s;erved; the arts of delu&s;ion were no longer continued to the efforts of de&s;igning individuals.</P>
<P>The very forbearance to pre&s;s pro&s;ecutions, was mi&s;in|terpreted into a fear of urging the execution of the laws;
<PB N="73" REF="031402_0037_0FEF91EF93562648">
and a&s;&s;ociations of men began to denounce threats again&s;t the officers employed. From a belief that, by a more for|mal concert, their operation might be defeated, certain &s;elf-created &s;ocieties a&s;&s;umed the tone of condemnation. Hence, while the greater part of Penn&s;ylvania it&s;elf were conforming them&s;elves to the acts of exci&s;e, a few counties were re&s;olved to fru&s;trate them. It was now perceived, that every expectation from the tenderne&s;s which had hitherto been pur&s;ued, was unavailing, and that further delay could only create an opinion of impotency, or irre&s;olution in the government. Legal proce&s;s, was, therefore, delivered to the Mar&s;hal, again&s;t the rioters and delinquent di&s;tillers.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was he under&s;tood to be engaged in this duty, than the vengeance of armed men was aimed at his per|&s;on, and the per&s;onal property of the In&s;pector of the Rev|enue. They fired upon the Mar&s;hal, arre&s;ted him, and detained him for &s;ome time as a pri&s;oner. He was obli|ged, by the jeopardy of his life, to renounce the &s;ervice of other proce&s;s, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Allegany moun|tain; and a deputation was afterwards &s;ent to him to de|mand a &s;urrender of that which he <HI>had</HI> &s;erved. A nume|rous body repeatedly attacked the hou&s;e of the In&s;pector, &s;eized his papers of office, and finally de&s;troyed, by fire, his buildings, and what&s;oever they contained. Both of the&s;e officers, from a ju&s;t regard to their &s;afety, fled to the &s;eat of government; it being avowed, that the motives of &s;uch out|rages were, to compel the re&s;ignation of the In&s;pector; to with&s;tand by the force of arms, the authority of the United States, and thereby to extort a repeal of the laws of exci&s;e, and an alteration in the conduct of government.</P>
<P>Upon the te&s;timony of the&s;e facts, an a&s;&s;ociate ju&s;tice of the &s;upreme court of the United States notified to me, that "in the counties of Wa&s;hington and Allegany, in Penn|&s;ylvania, laws of the United States were oppo&s;ed, and the execution thereof ob&s;tructed, by combinations, too power|ful to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial pro|ceedings, or by the powers ve&s;ted in the Mar&s;hal of that di&s;trict." On this call, momentous in the extreme, I &s;ought and weighed what might be&s;t &s;ubdue the cri&s;is. On the one hand, the judiciary was pronounced to be &s;tript of
<PB N="74" REF="031402_0038_0FEF91F124E4C360">
its capacity to enforce the laws: Crimes, which reached the very exi&s;tence of &s;ocial order, were perpetrated with|out control; the friends of government were in&s;ulted, abu|&s;ed, and overawed into &s;ilence, or an apparent acquie&s;cence; and to yield to the trea&s;onable fury of &s;o &s;mall a portion of the United States, would be to violate the fundamental prin|ciple of our con&s;titution, which enjoins, that the will of the majority &s;hall prevail. On the other, to array citizen a|gain&s;t citizen&mdash;to publi&s;h the di&s;honour of &s;uch exce&s;&s;es&mdash; to encounter the expen&s;e, and other embarra&s;&s;ments of &s;o di&s;tant an expedition, were &s;teps too delicate, too clo&s;ely interwoven with many affecting con&s;iderations, to be lightly adopted. I po&s;tponed, therefore, the &s;ummoning the mi|litia immediately into the field; but I required them to be held in readine&s;s, that if my anxious endeavours to reclaim the deluded, and to convince the malignant of their dan|ger, &s;hould be fruitle&s;s, military force might be prepared to act, before the &s;ea&s;on &s;hould be too far advanced.</P>
<P>My proclamation of the 7th of Augu&s;t la&s;t, was accord|ingly i&s;&s;ued, and accompanied by the appointment of com|mi&s;&s;ioners, who were charged to repair to the &s;cene of in|&s;urrection. They were authori&s;ed to confer with any bod|ies of men, or individuals. They were in&s;tructed to be candid and explicit, in &s;tating the &s;en&s;ations which had been excited in the Executive, and his earne&s;t wi&s;h to avoid a re&s;ort to coercion; to repre&s;ent, however, that without &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, coercion <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be the re&s;ort; but to invite them, at the &s;ame time, to return to the demeanor of faithful citi|zens, by &s;uch accommodations as lay within the &s;phere of the executive power&mdash;pardon, too, was tendered to them by the government of the United States, and that of Penn|&s;ylvania; upon no other condition, than a &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;u|rance of obedience to the laws.</P>
<P>Although the report of the Commi&s;&s;ioners marks their firmne&s;s and abilities, and mu&s;t unite all virtuous men, by &s;hewing that the means of conciliation have been exhau&s;t|ed; all of tho&s;e who had committed, or abetted the tu|mults, did not &s;ub&s;cribe the mild form, which was propo|&s;ed as the atonement; and the indications of a peaceable temper were neither &s;ufficiently general, nor conclu&s;ive to
<PB N="75" REF="031402_0038_0FEF91F124E4C360">
recommend or warrant a further &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the march of the militia.</P>
<P>Thus the painful alternative could not be di&s;carded. I ordered the militia to march, after once more admoni&s;hing the in&s;urgents, in my proclamation of the 25th of Septem|ber la&s;t.</P>
<P>It was a ta&s;k, too difficult to a&s;certain, with preci&s;ion, the lowe&s;t degree of force competent to the quelling of the in&s;urrection. From a re&s;pect, indeed, to economy and the ea&s;e of my fellow-citizens&punc; belonging to the militia, it would have gratified me to accompli&s;h &s;uch an e&s;timate. My very great reluctance to a&s;cribe too much importance to the op|po&s;ition, had its extent been accurately &s;een, would have been a decided inducement to the &s;malle&s;t efficient num|bers. In this uncertainty, therefore, I put into motion fifteen thou&s;and men, as being an army, which, according to all human calculation, would be prompt, and adequate, in every view, and might perhaps, by rendering re&s;i&s;tance de&s;perate, prevent the effu&s;ion of blood. Quotas had been a&s;&s;igned to the States of New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Mary|land and Virginia; the Governor of Penn&s;ylvania having declared on this occa&s;ion, an opinion which ju&s;tified a re|qui&s;ition to the other States.</P>
<P>As Commander in Chief of the militia, when called in|to the actual &s;ervice of the United States, I have vi&s;ited the places of general rendezvous, to obtain more exact information, and to direct a plan for ulterior movements. Had there been room for a per&s;ua&s;ion that the laws were &s;ecure from ob&s;truction; that the civil magi&s;trate was able to bring to ju&s;tice &s;uch of the mo&s;t culpable as have not embraced the proffered terms of amne&s;ty, and may be deemed fit objects of example; that the friends of peace and good government were not in need of that aid and countenance, which they ought always to receive, and I tru&s;t ever will receive, again&s;t the vicious and turbulent, I &s;hould have caught with avidity the opportunity of re&s;to|ring the militia to their families and home. But &s;ucceed|ing intelligence has tended to manife&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of what has been done; it being now confe&s;&s;ed, by tho&s;e who were not inclined to exaggerate the ill conduct of the in&s;urgents,
<PB N="76" REF="031402_0039_0FEF91F51ADDBB38">
that their malevolence was not pointed merely to a partic|ular law, but that a &s;pirit inimical to all order, has actua|ted many of the offenders. If the &s;tate of things had af|forded rea&s;on for the continuance of my pre&s;ence with the army, it would not have been withholden; but every appearance a&s;&s;uring &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue as will redound to the rep|utation and &s;trength of the United States, I have judged it mo&s;t proper to re&s;ume my duties at the &s;eat of govern|ment, leaving the chief command with the Governor of Virginia.</P>
<P>Still, however, as it is probable, that in a commotion like the pre&s;ent, what&s;oever may be the pretence, the pur|po&s;es of mi&s;chief and revenge may not be laid a&s;ide; the &s;tationing of a &s;mall force for a certain period, in the four we&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania, will be indi&s;pen&s;able, whether we contemplate the &s;ituation of tho&s;e who are connected with the execution of the laws, or of others, who may have expo&s;ed them&s;elves by an honourable attach|ment to them.</P>
<P>Thirty days from the commencement of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, be|ing the legal limitation of the employment of the militia, Congre&s;s cannot be too early occupied with this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Among the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions which may ari&s;e from this a&s;|pect of our affairs, and from the documents which will be &s;ubmitted to Congre&s;s, it will not e&s;cape their ob&s;ervation, that not only the In&s;pector of the Revenue, but other offi|cers of the United States in Penn&s;ylvania, have, from their fidelity in the di&s;charge of their functions, &s;u&s;tained mate|rial injuries to their property. The obligation and policy of indemnifying them, are &s;trong and obvious. It may al&s;o merit attention, whether policy will not enlarge this provi&s;ion to the retribution of our citizens, who, though not under the ties of office, may have &s;uffered damage by their generous exertions for upholding the con&s;titution and the laws. The amount, even if all the injured were included, would not be great; and on future emergencies, the gov|ernment would be amply repaid by the influence of an ex|ample, that he who incurs a lo&s;s in its defence, &s;hall find a recompen&s;e in its liberality.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="031402_0039_0FEF91F51ADDBB38">While there is cau&s;e to lament that occurrences of this nature &s;hould have di&s;graced the name, or interrupted the tranquillity of any part of our community, or &s;hould have diverted to a new application, any portion of the public re&s;ources, there are not wanting real and &s;ub&s;tantial con&s;o|lations for the misfortune. It has demon&s;trated that our pro&s;perity re&s;ts on &s;olid foundations; by furni&s;hing an ad|ditional proof, that my fellow-citizens under&s;tand the true principles of government and liberty; that they feel their in&s;eparable union; that, notwith&s;tanding all the devices that have been made u&s;e of to &s;way them from their inter|e&s;t and duty, they are now as ready to maintain the author|ity of the laws again&s;t licentious inva&s;ions, as they were to defend their rights again&s;t u&s;urpation. It has been a &s;pec|tacle, di&s;playing to the highe&s;t advantage, the value of re|publican government, to behold the mo&s;t and lea&s;t wealthy of our citizens &s;tanding in the &s;ame ranks as private &s;ol|diers; pre-eminently di&s;tingui&s;hing by being the army of the con&s;titution; undeterred by a march of three hundred miles, over rugged mountains, by the approach of an in|clement &s;ea&s;on, or by any other di&s;couragement. Nor ought I to omit to acknowledge the efficacious and patri|otic co-operation which I have experienced from the Chief Magi&s;trates of the States to which my requi&s;itions have been addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>To every de&s;cription, indeed, of citizens, let prai&s;e be given; but let them per&s;evere in their affectionate vigilance over that precious depo&s;itory of American happine&s;s, the Con&s;titution of the United States. Let them cheri&s;h it too, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e, who, from every clime, are daily &s;eeking a dwelling in our land. And when, in the calm moments of reflection, they &s;hall have retraced the origin and progre&s;s of the in&s;urrection, let them determine, wheth|er it has not been fomented by combinations of men, who, carele&s;s of con&s;equences, and di&s;regarding the unerring truth, that tho&s;e who rou&s;e, cannot always appea&s;e a civil convul&s;ion, have di&s;&s;eminated, from an ignorance or perver|&s;ion of facts, &s;u&s;picions, jealou&s;ies, and accu&s;ations of the whole government.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="031402_0040_0FEF91F6A2B6D740">Having thus fulfilled the engagement which I took, when I entered into office, "to the be&s;t of my ability to pre&s;erve, protect and defend the Con&s;titution of the United States," on you, gentlemen, and the people by whom you are deputed, I rely for &s;upport.</P>
<P>In the arrangements to which the po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;imilar contingency will naturally draw your attention, it ought not to be forgotten, that the militia laws have exhibited &s;uch &s;triking defects, as could not have been &s;upplied but by the zeal of our citizens. Be&s;ides the extraordinary expen&s;e and wa&s;te, which are not the lea&s;t of the defects, every appeal to tho&s;e laws is attended with a doubt of its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The devi&s;ing and e&s;tabli&s;hing of a well-regulated militia, would be a genuine &s;ource of legi&s;lative honour, and a per|fect title to public gratitude. I therefore entertain a hope, that the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion will not pa&s;s, without carrying to its full energy, the power of organizing, arming and di&s;ciplining the militia; and thus providing, in the language of the con&s;titution, for calling them forth to execute the laws of the Union, &s;uppre&s;s in&s;urrection, and repel inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>As auxiliary to the &s;tate of our defence to which Con|gre&s;s cannot too frequently recur, they will not omit to in|quire whether the fortifications which have been already licen&s;ed by law, be commen&s;urate with our exigencies.</P>
<P>The intelligence from the army under the command of General Wayne, is a happy pre&s;age to our military ope|rations again&s;t the ho&s;tile Indians north of the Ohio. From the advices which have been forwarded, the advance he has made mu&s;t have damped the ardour of the &s;avages, and weakened their ob&s;tinacy in waging war again&s;t the United States; and yet, even at this late hour, when our power to puni&s;h them cannot be que&s;tioned, we &s;hall not be unwilling to cement a la&s;ting peace, upon terms of can|dour, equity, and good neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Towards none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friend&s;hip been &s;pared. The Creeks in particular are cov|ered from encroachment by the interpo&s;ition of the Gene|ral Government, and that of Georgia. From a de&s;ire al&s;o to remove the di&s;contents of the Six Nations, a &s;ettlement,

<P>THE time which has elap&s;ed &s;ince the commencement of our fi&s;cal mea&s;ures, has developed our pecuniary re&s;our|ces, &s;o as to open a way for a definitive plan for the re|demption of our public debt. It is believed, that the re|&s;ult is &s;uch as to encourage Congre&s;s to con&s;ummate this work without delay. Nothing can more promote the per|manent welfare of the nation, and nothing would be more grateful to our con&s;tituents. Indeed, what&s;oever is unfin|i&s;hed of our &s;y&s;tem of public credit, cannot be benefited by procra&s;tination, and, as far as may be practicable, we ought to place that credit on grounds which cannot be di&s;turbed, and to prevent that progre&s;&s;ive accumulation of debt, which mu&s;t ultimately endanger all governments.</P>
<P>An e&s;timate of the nece&s;&s;ary appropriations, including the expenditures into which we have been driven by the in&s;urrection, will be &s;ubmitted to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE, AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</P>
<P>THE Mint of the United States has entered upon the coinage of the precious metals, and con&s;iderable &s;ums of de|fective coins and bullion have been lodged with the di|rector by individuals. There is a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, that the in&s;titution will, at no remote day, realize the expecta|tion which was originally formed of its utility.</P>
<P>In &s;ub&s;equent communications, certain circum&s;tances of our intercour&s;e with foreign nations will be tran&s;mitted to Congre&s;s; however, it may not be un&s;ea&s;onable to an|nounce, that my policy, in our foreign tran&s;actions, has been,
<PB N="80" REF="031402_0041_0FEF91FA4127BB08">
to cultivate peace with all the world&mdash;to ob&s;erve treaties with pure and ab&s;olute faith&mdash;to check every deviation from the line of impartiality&mdash;to explain what may have been mi&s;apprehended, and correct what may have been in|jurious to any nation; and having thus acquired the right, to lo&s;e no time in acquiring the ability, to in&s;i&s;t upon ju&s;|tice being done our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Let us unite, therefore, in imploring the Supreme Ruler of nations to &s;pread his holy protection over the&s;e United States&mdash;to turn the machinations of the wicked to the con|firming of our con&s;titution&mdash;to enable us at all times to root out internal &s;edition, and put inva&s;ion to flight&mdash;to perpetuate to our country that pro&s;perity which his good|ne&s;s has already conferred, and to verify the anticipation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this government being a &s;afeguard to human rights.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE receive, with plea&s;ure, your &s;peech to the two Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s. In it we perceive renewed proofs of that vigilant and paternal concern for the pro&s;perity, honour and happine&s;s of our country, which has uniformly di&s;tingui&s;hed your pa&s;t admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Our anxiety, ari&s;ing from the licentious and open re&s;i&s;t|ance to the laws, in the we&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania, has been increa&s;ed by the proceedings of certain &s;elf-cre|ated &s;ocieties, relative to the laws and admini&s;tration of the government; proceedings, in our apprehen&s;ion, founded in political error, calculated, if not intended, to di&s;orga|nize our government, and which, by in&s;piring delu&s;ive hopes of &s;upport, have been influential in mi&s;leading our fellow-citizens in the &s;cene of in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>In a &s;ituation &s;o delicate and important, the lenient and per&s;ua&s;ive mea&s;ures, which you adopted, merit and receive
<PB N="81" REF="031402_0041_0FEF91FA4127BB08">
our affectionate approbation. The&s;e failing to procure their proper effects, and coercion having become inevita|ble; we have derived the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction from the en|lightened patrioti&s;m, and animating zeal, with which the citizens of New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland and Vir|ginia have rallied around the &s;tandard of government, in oppo&s;ition to anarchy and in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Our warm and cordial acknowledgments are due to you, Sir, for the wi&s;dom and deci&s;ion, with which you arrayed the militia, to execute the public will; and to them, for the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and alacrity with which they obeyed your &s;ummons.</P>
<P>The example is precious to the theory of our govern|ment, and confers the brighte&s;t honour upon the patriots who have given it.</P>
<P>We &s;hall readily concur in &s;uch farther provi&s;ions for the &s;ecurity of internal peace, and a due obedience to the laws, as the occa&s;ion manife&s;tly requires.</P>
<P>The effectual organization of the militia, and a prudent attention to the fortifications of our ports and harbours, are &s;ubjects of great national importance, and, together with the other mea&s;ures you have been plea&s;ed to recom|mend, will receive our deliberate con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the troops, under the command of Gen|eral Wayne, cannot fall to produce e&s;&s;ential advantages. The plea&s;ure, with which we acknowledge the merits of that gallant General and army, is enhanced by the hope, that their victories will lay the foundation for a &s;peedy and durable peace with the Indian tribes.</P>
<P>At a period, &s;o momentous in the affairs of nations, the temperate, ju&s;t and firm policy, that you have pur&s;ued in re&s;pect to foreign powers, has been eminently calculated to promote the great and e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of our country, and has created the faire&s;t title to the public gratitude and thanks.</P>

<P>AMONG the occa&s;ions, which have been afforded for expre&s;&s;ing my &s;en&s;e of the zealous and &s;tedfa&s;t co-ope|ration of the Senate, in the maintenance of government, none has yet occurred, more forcibly demanding my un|qualified acknowledgments, than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Next to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of upright intentions, it is the highe&s;t plea&s;ure to be approved by the enlightened Repre|&s;entatives of a free nation. With the &s;atisfaction, there|fore, which ari&s;es from an unalterable attachment to public order, do I learn, that the Senate di&s;countenances tho&s;e pro|ceedings, which would arrogate the direction of our af|fairs without any degree of authority derived from the people.</P>
<P>It has been more than once the lot of our government, to be thrown into new and delicate &s;ituations; and of the&s;e the in&s;urrection has not been the lea&s;t important. Having been compelled, at length, to lay a&s;ide my repugnance to re&s;ort to arms, I derive much happine&s;s, from being con|firmed, by your judgment, in the nece&s;&s;ity of deci&s;ive mea&s;ures, and from the &s;upport of my fellow-citizens of the militia, who were the patriotic in&s;truments of that nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>With &s;uch demon&s;trations of affection for our con&s;titu|tion&mdash;with an adequate organization of the militia&mdash;with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of nece&s;&s;ary fortifications&mdash;with a con|tinuance of tho&s;e judicious and &s;pirited exertions, which brought victory to our we&s;tern army&mdash;with a due attention to public credit, and an un&s;ullied honour towards all nations, we may meet, under every a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s, our enemies from within and from without.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, calling to mind the ble&s;&s;ings of the people of the United States, and e&s;pe|cially the happine&s;s of living under con&s;titutions and laws, which re&s;t on their authority alone, could not learn, with other emotions than tho&s;e you have expre&s;&s;ed, that any part of our fellow-citizens &s;hould have &s;hewn them&s;elves capa|ble of an in&s;urrection; and we learn, with the greate&s;t concern, that any mi&s;repre&s;entations, whatever, of the gov|ernment and its proceedings, either by individuals, or com|binations of men, &s;hould have been made, and &s;o far cred|ited, as to foment the flagrant outrage, which has been committed on the laws.</P>
<P>We feel with you the deepe&s;t regret, at &s;o painful an occurrence in the annals of our country. As men, re|gardful of the tender intere&s;ts of humanity, we look with grief at &s;cenes which have &s;tained our land with civil blood. As lovers of public order, we lament that it has &s;uffered &s;o flagrant a violation. As zealous friends of a re|publican government, we deplore every occa&s;ion which, in the hands of its enemies, may be turned into calumny again&s;t it.</P>
<P>This a&s;pect of the cri&s;is, however, is happily not the only one which it pre&s;ents. There is another which yields all the con&s;olations which you have drawn from it. It has demon&s;trated to the candid world, as well as to the American people them&s;elves, that the great body of them, every where, are equally attached to the luminous and vital principle of our con&s;titution, which enjoins, that the will of the majority &s;hall prevail; that they under&s;tand the in|di&s;&s;oluble union between true liberty and regular govern|ment; that they feel their duties no le&s;s than they are watchful over their rights; that they will be as ready at all times to cru&s;h licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as they have been to defeat u&s;urpation. In a word, that they are capable of carrying into execution that noble plan of &s;elf-government which
<PB N="84" REF="031402_0043_0FEF920240BD54C0">
they have cho&s;en as the guarantee of their own happine&s;s, and the a&s;ylum for that of all from every clime, who may wi&s;h to unite their de&s;tiny with ours.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the ju&s;t inferences flowing from the prompti|tude with which the &s;ummons to the &s;tandard of the laws has been obeyed; and from the &s;entiments which have been witne&s;&s;ed in every de&s;cription of citizens, in every quarter of the Union. The &s;pectacle, therefore, when viewed in its true light may well be affirmed to di&s;play in equal lu&s;tre the virtues of the American character, and the value of Republican government. All mu&s;t particu|larly acknowledge and applaud the patrioti&s;m of that por|tion of citizens, who have freely &s;acrificed every thing le&s;s dear than the love of their country, to the meritorious ta&s;k of defending its happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the part which you your&s;elf have borne through this delicate and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing period, we trace the additional proofs it has afforded of y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;olicitude for the public good. Your laudable and &s;ucce&s;sful endeavours to ren|der lenity in executing the laws conducive to their real energy, and to convert tumult into order, without the ef|fu&s;ion of blood, form a particular title to the confidence and prai&s;e of your con&s;tituents. In all that may be found nece&s;&s;ary, on our part to complete this benevolent purpo&s;e, and to &s;ecure the mini&s;ters and friends of the laws again&s;t the remains of danger, our due co-operation will be af|forded.</P>
<P>The other &s;ubjects which you have recommended, or communicated, and of which &s;everal are particularly in|tere&s;ting, will all receive the attention which they demand. We are deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of an effec|tual organization of the Militia.</P>
<P>We rejoice at the intelligence of the advance and &s;uc|ce&s;s of the army under the command of General Wayne. Whether we regard it as a proof of the per&s;e|verance, prowe&s;s and &s;uperiority of our troops, or as a happy pre&s;age to our military operations again&s;t the ho&s;|tile Indians, as a probable prelude to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a la&s;ting peace, upon terms of candour, equity and good neighbourhood&mdash;we receive it with the greater plea&s;ure,
<PB N="85" REF="031402_0043_0FEF920240BD54C0">
as it increa&s;es the probability of &s;ooner re&s;toring a part of the public re&s;ources to the de&s;irable object of reducing the public debt.</P>
<P>We &s;hall on this, as on all occa&s;ions, be di&s;po&s;ed to adopt any mea&s;ure which may advance the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of our country.</P>
<P>In nothing can we more cordially unite with you than imploring the Supreme Ruler of Nations to multiply his ble&s;&s;ings on the United States&mdash;to guard our free and hap|py Con&s;titution again&s;t every machination and danger&mdash; and to make it the be&s;t &s;ource of public happine&s;s, by ver|ifying its character of being the be&s;t &s;afeguard of human rights.</P>

<P>I ANTICIPATED with confidence, the concur|rence of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, in the regret pro|duced by the in&s;urrection. Every effort ought to be u&s;ed to di&s;countenance what has contributed to foment it, and thus di&s;courage a repetition of like attempts. For, not|with&s;tanding the con&s;olations which may be drawn from the i&s;&s;ue of this event, it is far better that the artful ap|proaches on &s;uch a &s;ituation of things &s;hould be checked by the vigilant and duly admoni&s;hed patrioti&s;m of our fel|low-citizens, than that the evil &s;hould increa&s;e until it be|come nece&s;&s;ary to cru&s;h it by the &s;trength of their arm.</P>
<P>I am happy that the part which I have my&s;elf borne on this occa&s;ion, receives the approbation of your hou&s;e. For the di&s;charge of a con&s;titutional duty, it is a &s;ufficient reward to me to be a&s;&s;ured that you will unite in con&s;um|mating what remains to be done.</P>

<P>I TRUST I do not deceive my&s;elf, while I indulge the per&s;ua&s;ion, that I have never met you at any period, when, more than at the pre&s;ent, the &s;ituation of our public affairs has afforded ju&s;t cau&s;e for mutual congratulation, and for inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the Author of all good, for the numerous and extraordinary ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy.</P>
<P>The termination of the long, expen&s;ive and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war, in which we have been engaged with certain Indians, northwe&s;t of the Ohio, is placed in the option of the United States, by a treaty, which the commander of our army has concluded provi&s;ionally, with the ho&s;tile tribes in that region.</P>
<P>In the adju&s;tment of the terms, the &s;atisfaction of the Indians was deemed an object worthy no le&s;s of the policy, than of the liberality of the United States, as the nece&s;&s;a|ry ba&s;is of durable tranquillity. This object, it is believed, has been fully attained. The articles agreed upon, will immediately be laid before the Senate, for their con&s;id|eration.</P>
<P>The Creek and Cherokee Indians, who alone of the &s;outhern tribes had annoyed our frontiers, have lately con|firmed their pre-exi&s;ting Treaties with us; and were giv|ing evidence of a &s;incere di&s;po&s;ition to carry them into ef|fect, by the &s;urrender of the pri&s;oners and property they had taken. But we have to lament, that the fair pro&s;|pect in this quarter, has been once more clouded by wan|ton murders, which &s;ome citizens of Georgia are repre&s;ent|ed
<PB N="88" REF="031402_0045_0FEF8ECD67E541C0">
to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks; which have again &s;ubjected that frontier to di&s;qui|etude and danger; which will be productive of further ex|pen&s;e, and may occa&s;ion more effu&s;ion of blood. Mea&s;|ures are pur&s;uing to prevent or mitigate the u&s;ual con&s;e|quences of &s;uch outrages; and with the hope of their &s;uc|ceeding, at lea&s;t to avert general ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>A letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of our Treaty, made with his father the late Emperor; and, con&s;equently, the continuance of peace with that power. With peculiar &s;atisfaction I add, that information has been received from an Agent deputed on our part to Algiers, importing that the terms of the Trea|ty with the Dey and Regency of that country had been adju&s;ted in &s;uch a manner, as to authori&s;e the expectation of a &s;peedy Peace, and the re&s;toration of our unfortunate fellow-citizens, from a grievous captivity.</P>
<P>The late&s;t advices from our Envoy at the court of Mad|rid, give, moreover, the plea&s;ing information, that he had received a&s;&s;urances of a &s;peedy and &s;atisfactory conclu&s;ion of his negociation. While the event depending upon un|adju&s;ted particulars, cannot be regarded as a&s;certained, it is agreeable to cheri&s;h the expectation of an i&s;&s;ue, which, &s;ecuring amicably very e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the United States, will at the &s;ame time, lay the foundation of la&s;ting harmony with a power who&s;e friend&s;hip we have uniform|ly and &s;incerely de&s;ired to cultivate.</P>
<P>Though not before officially di&s;clo&s;ed to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, you, gentlemen, are all apprized, that a Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, has been negociated with Great Britain; and that the Senate have advi&s;ed and con&s;ented to its ratification, upon a condition which excepts part of one article. Agreeably thereto, and to the be&s;t judgment I was able to form of the public intere&s;t, after full and mature deliberation, I have added my &s;anction. The re&s;ult on the part of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, is unknown. When received, the &s;ubject will, without delay, be placed before Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>This intere&s;ting &s;ummary of our affairs, with regard to the foreign powers, between whom and the United States
<PB N="89" REF="031402_0045_0FEF8ECD67E541C0">
controver&s;ies have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and with regard al&s;o to tho&s;e of our Indian neighbours with whom we have been in a &s;tate of enmity or mi&s;under&s;tanding, opens a wide field for con&s;oling and gratifying reflections. If by prudence and moderation on every &s;ide, the extingui&s;hment of all the cau&s;es of external di&s;cord, which have heretofore menaced our tranquillity, on terms compatible with our national rights and honour, &s;hall be the happy re&s;ult; how firm and how precious a foundation will have been laid for accele|rating, maturing and e&s;tabli&s;hing the pro&s;perity of our country.</P>
<P>Contemplating the internal &s;ituation, as well as the ex|ternal relations of the United States, we di&s;cover equal cau&s;e for contentment and &s;atisfaction. While many of the nations of Europe, with their American dependencies, have been involved in a conte&s;t unu&s;ually bloody, exhau&s;t|ing and calamitous; in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by dome&s;tic convul&s;ion and in&s;urrec|tion; in which many of the arts mo&s;t u&s;eful to &s;ociety have been expo&s;ed to di&s;couragement and decay; in which &s;carcity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence has embittered other &s;ufferings; while even the anticipations of a return of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and repo&s;e, are alloyed by the &s;en&s;e of heavy and accumulating burthens, which pre&s;s upon all the depart|ments of indu&s;try, and threaten to clog the future &s;prings of government;&mdash;our favoured country, happy in a &s;trik|ing contra&s;t, has enjoyed general tranquillity; a tranquil|lity the more &s;atisfactory, becau&s;e maintained at the ex|pen&s;e of no duty. Faithful to our&s;elves, we have violated no obligation to others. Our agriculture, commerce and manufactures pro&s;per beyond former example; the mole&s;|tations of our trade (to prevent a continuance of which, however, very pointed remon&s;trances have been made) being overbalanced by the aggregate benefits which it de|rives from a neutral po&s;ition. Our population advances with a celerity which, exceeding the mo&s;t &s;anguine cal|culations, proportionally augments our &s;trength and re|&s;ources, and guarantees our future &s;ecurity. Every part of the Union di&s;plays indications of rapid and various im|provement, and with burthens &s;o light as &s;carcely to be
<PB N="90" REF="031402_0046_0FEF920BEE03EC28">
perceived; with re&s;ources fully adequate to our pre&s;ent exigencies; with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty, and with mild and whole&s;ome laws;&mdash;is it too much to &s;ay, that our country exhibits a &s;pectacle of national happine&s;s never &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, if ever be|fore equalled?</P>
<P>Placed in a &s;ituation every way &s;o au&s;picious, motives of commanding force impel us, with &s;incere acknowl|edgment to Heaven, and pure love to our country, to unite our efforts to pre&s;erve, prolong and improve, our im|men&s;e advantages. To co-operate with you in this de|&s;irable work, is a fervent and favourite wi&s;h of my heart.</P>
<P>It is a valuable ingredient, in the general e&s;timate of our welfare, that the part of our country, which was late|ly the &s;cene of di&s;order and in&s;urrection, now enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of quiet and order. The mi&s;led have abandoned their errors, and pay the re&s;pect to our con&s;titution and laws which is due from good citizens to the public au|thorities of the &s;ociety. The&s;e circum&s;tances have in|duced me to pardon, generally, the offenders here refer|red to; and to extend forgivene&s;s to tho&s;e who had been adjudged to capital puni&s;hment. For though I &s;hall al|ways think it a &s;acred duty, to exerci&s;e with firmne&s;s and energy the con&s;titutional powers with which I am ve&s;ted; yet it appears to me no le&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with the public good, than it is with my per&s;onal feelings, to mingle in the operations of government every degree of moderation and tenderne&s;s which the national ju&s;tice, dignity and &s;afety may permit.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>Among the objects which will claim your attention in the cour&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, a review of our military e&s;tabli&s;h|ment is not the lea&s;t important. It is called for by the events which have changed, and may be expected &s;till further to change the relative &s;ituation of our frontiers. In this review, you will doubtle&s;s allow due weight to the con&s;iderations, that the que&s;tions between us and certain foreign powers, are not yet finally adju&s;ted; that the war in Europe is not yet terminated; and that our We&s;tern
<PB N="91" REF="031402_0046_0FEF920BEE03EC28">
Po&s;ts, when recovered, will demand provi&s;ion for garri|&s;oning and &s;ecuring them. A &s;tatement of our pre&s;ent military force will be laid before you by the department of war.</P>
<P>With the review of our army e&s;tabli&s;ment is naturally connected that of the militia. It will merit inquiry, what imperfections in the exi&s;ting plan, further experience may have unfolded. The &s;ubject is of &s;o much moment in my e&s;timation, as to excite a con&s;tant &s;olicitude, that the con|&s;ideration of it may be renewed, till the greate&s;t attainable perfection &s;hall be accompli&s;hed. Time is wearing away &s;ome advantages for forwarding the object, while none better de&s;erves the per&s;evering attention of the public councils.</P>
<P>While we indulge the &s;atisfaction, which the actual con|dition of our We&s;tern borders &s;o well authorizes, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould not lo&s;e &s;ight of an important truth, which continually receives new confirmations, namely, that the provi&s;ions heretofore made with a view to the protec|tion of the Indians from the violences of the lawle&s;s part of our frontier inhabitants are in&s;ufficient. It is demon|&s;trated that the&s;e violences can now be perpetrated with impunity; and it can need no argument to prove, that un|le&s;s the murdering of Indians can be re&s;trained by bring|ing the murderers to condign puni&s;hment, all the exertions of the government to prevent de&s;tructive retaliations by the Indians, will prove fruitle&s;s, and all our pre&s;ent agreeable pro&s;pects illu&s;ory. The frequent de&s;truction of innocent women and children, who are chiefly the victims of retal|iation, mu&s;t continue to &s;hock humanity; and an enor|mous expen&s;e, to drain the trea&s;ury of the Union.</P>
<P>To enforce upon the Indians the ob&s;ervance of ju&s;tice, it is indi&s;pen&s;able that there &s;hall be competent means of rendering ju&s;tice to them. If the&s;e means can be devi&s;ed by the wi&s;dom of Congre&s;s; and e&s;pecially if there can be added an adequate provi&s;ion for &s;upplying the nece&s;&s;ities of the Indians, on rea&s;onable terms, (a mea&s;ure, the mention of which I the more readily repeat, as in all the conferen|ces with them, they urge it with &s;olicitude) I &s;hould not he&s;itate to entertain a &s;trong hope of rendering our tran|quillity permanent. I add, with plea&s;ure, that the proba|bility

<P>IT is with peculiar &s;atisfaction that we are informed by your Speech to the two Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, that the long and expen&s;ive war, in which we have been engaged with the Indians northwe&s;t of the Ohio, is in a &s;ituation to be finally terminated; and though we view with con|cern the danger of an interruption of the peace &s;o recently confirmed with the Creeks, we indulge the hope, that the mea&s;ure you have adopted to prevent the &s;ame, if followed by tho&s;e legi&s;lative provi&s;ions that ju&s;tice and humanity equally demand, will &s;ucceed in laying the foundation of a la&s;ting peace with the Indian tribes, on the Southern as well as on the We&s;tern frontiers.</P>
<P>The confirmation of our treaty with Morocco, and the adju&s;tment of a treaty of peace with Algiers, in con&s;e|quence of which our captive fellow-citizens &s;hall be de|livered from &s;lavery, are events that will prove no le&s;s in|tere&s;ting to the public humanity, than they will be im|portant in extending and &s;ecuring the navigation and com|merce of our country.</P>
<P>As a ju&s;t and equitable conclu&s;ion of our depending negociations with Spain will e&s;&s;entially advance the in|tere&s;t of both nations, and thereby cheri&s;h and confirm the good under&s;tanding and friend&s;hip which we have at all times de&s;ired to maintain, it will afford us real plea&s;ure to receive an early confirmation of our expectations on this &s;ubject.</P>

<P>AS the Repre&s;entatives of the People of the United States, we cannot but participate in the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;ibility to every ble&s;&s;ing which they enjoy, and cheerfully join with you in profound gratitude to the Author of all good, for the numerous and extraordinary ble&s;&s;ings which he has con&s;erved on our favoured country.</P>
<P>A final and formal termination of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war which has ravaged our northwe&s;tern frontier, will be an event which mu&s;t afford a &s;atisfaction proportioned to the anxiety with which it has long been &s;ought; and in the adju&s;tment of the terms, we perceive the true policy of making them &s;atisfactory to the Indians, as well as to the United States, as the be&s;t ba&s;is of a durable tranquillity. The di&s;po&s;ition of &s;uch of the &s;outhern tribes, as had al&s;o heretofore annoyed our frontier, is another pro&s;pect in our &s;ituation &s;o important to the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the United States, that it is much to be lamented that any clouds &s;hould be thrown over it, more e&s;pecially by exce&s;|&s;es on the part of our own citizens.</P>

<P>WITH the utmo&s;t attention I have con&s;idered your re&s;olution of the 24th in&s;t. reque&s;ting me to lay before your Hou&s;e a copy of the in&s;tructions to the mini&s;ter of the United States, who negociated the treaty with the king of Great Britain, together with the corre&s;pondence and other documents relative to that treaty, excepting &s;uch of the &s;aid papers as any exi&s;ting negociation may render im|proper to be di&s;clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In deliberating on this &s;ubject, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to lo&s;e &s;ight of the principle which &s;ome have avowed in its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, or to avoid extending my views to the con&s;equences which mu&s;t flow from the admi&s;&s;ion of that principle.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a di&s;po&s;ition to withhold any information which the Con|&s;titution has enjoined upon the Pre&s;ident as a duty to give, or which could be required of him by either Hou&s;e of Con|gre&s;s as a right; and with truth I affirm, that it has been, as it will continue to be while I have the honour to pre|&s;ide in the government, my con&s;tant endeavour to harmo|nize with the other branches thereof, &s;o far as the tru&s;t delegated to me by the people of the United States, and my &s;en&s;e of the obligation it impo&s;es to "pre&s;erve, pro|tect, and defend the Con&s;titution," will permit.</P>
<P>The nature of foreign negociations requires caution; and their &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t often depend on &s;ecrecy, and even when brought to a conclu&s;ion, a full di&s;clo&s;ure of all the mea&s;ures, demands or eventual conce&s;&s;ions which may
<PB N="99" REF="031402_0050_0FEF9234580BA3C0">
have been propo&s;ed or contemplated, would be extremely impolitic; for this might have a pernicious influence on future negociations, or produce immediate inconveniences; perhaps danger and mi&s;chief, in relation to other powers. The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch caution and &s;ecrecy was one cogent rea&s;on for ve&s;ting the power of making treaties in the Pre&s;ident, with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate; the principle on which that body was formed, confining it to a &s;mall number of members. To admit, then, a right in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, to demand, and to have, as a matter of cour&s;e, all the papers re&s;pecting a negocia|tion with a foreign power, would be to e&s;tabli&s;h a danger|ous precedent.</P>
<P>It does not occur, that the in&s;pection of the papers a&s;ked for, can be relative to any purpo&s;e under the cog|ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, except that of an impeachment, which the re&s;olution has not expre&s;&s;ed. I repeat, that I have no di&s;po&s;ition to withhold any in|formation which the duty of my &s;tation will permit, or the public good &s;hall require, to be di&s;clo&s;ed; and, in fact, all the papers affecting the negociation with Great Britain, were laid before the Senate, when the treaty it&s;elf was communicated for their con&s;ideration and advice.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e which the debate has taken on the re&s;o|lution of the Hou&s;e, leads to &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the mode of making treaties under the Con&s;titution of the United States.</P>
<P>Having been a member of the General Convention, and knowing the principles on which the Con&s;titution was formed, I have ever entertained but one opinion on this &s;ubject; and from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the gov|ernment to this moment, my conduct has exemplified that opinion, that the power of making treaties is ex|clu&s;ively ve&s;ted in the Pre&s;ident, by and with the advice of the Senate, provided two-thirds of the Senators pre&s;ent concur; and that every treaty &s;o made and promulgated, thenceforward became the law of the land. It is thus that the treaty making power has been under&s;tood by foreign nations; and in all treaties made with them, we have declared, and they have believed, that when ratified
<PB N="100" REF="031402_0051_0FEF8EF58F8E0E40">
by the Pre&s;ident, with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, they became obligatory. In this con&s;truction of the Con&s;titution, every Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives has heretofore acquie&s;ced; and until the pre&s;ent time, not a doubt or &s;u&s;picion has appeared to my knowledge, that this con&s;truction was not the true one. Nay, they have more than acquie&s;ced; for until now, without contro|verting the obligation of &s;uch treaties, they have made all the requi&s;ite provi&s;ions for carrying them into effect.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o rea&s;on to believe that this con&s;truction agrees with the opinions entertained by the State Con|ventions, when they were deliberating on the Con&s;titu|tion; e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who objected to it, becau&s;e there was not required in <HI>commercial treaties</HI> the con&s;ent of two-thirds of the whole Senate, in&s;tead of two-thirds of the Senators pre&s;ent; and becau&s;e in treaties re&s;pect|ing territorial and certain other rights and claims, the concurrence of three-fourths of the whole number of the members of both Hou&s;es re&s;pectively was not made nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It is a fact declared by the General Convention, and univer&s;ally under&s;tood, that the Con&s;titution of the United States was the re&s;ult of a &s;pirit of amity and mutual con|ce&s;&s;ion. And it is well known that under this influ|ence, the &s;maller States were admitted to an equal rep|re&s;entation in Senate, with the larger States; and that this branch of the government was inve&s;ted with great powers; for on the equal participation of tho&s;e powers the &s;overeignty and political &s;afety of the &s;maller States were deemed e&s;&s;entially to depend.</P>
<P>If other proofs than the&s;e, and the plain letter of the Con&s;titution it&s;elf be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain the point under con&s;ideration, they may be found in the journals of the General Convention, which I have depo&s;ited in the office of the department of &s;tate. In tho&s;e journals it will appear that a propo&s;ition was made, "that no treaty &s;hould be binding on the United States which was not ratified by a law;" and that the propo&s;ition was ex|plicitly rejected.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="031402_0051_0FEF8EF58F8E0E40">As, therefore, it is perfectly clear to my under&s;tand|ing, that the a&s;&s;ent of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives is not nece&s;&s;ary to the validity of a treaty; as the treaty with <HI>Great Britain</HI> exhibits, in it&s;elf, all the objects requiring legi&s;lative provi&s;ion, and on which the&s;e papers called for can throw no light; and as it is e&s;&s;ential to the due admini&s;tration of the government, that the boundaries fix|ed by the Con&s;titution, between the different departments &s;hould be pre&s;erved&mdash;a ju&s;t regard to the Con&s;titution, and to the duty of my office, under all the circum|&s;tances of this ca&s;e, forbid a compliance with your re|que&s;t.</P>

<P>WE feel the honour you have this day conferred on the town of Baltimore, by favouring it with your pre&s;|ence, infinitely heightened and enhanced by the de&s;irable event which has produced it. Happy to behold your el|evation permit us to re-a&s;&s;ure you of our pure&s;t love and affection.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the occa&s;ion that has once more drawn you from the &s;cenes of dome&s;tic ea&s;e and private tranquil|lity, our thoughts naturally turn on the &s;ituation of our country, previous to the expedient of the late General Convention. When you became a member of that body which framed our new and excellent Con&s;titution, you di&s;&s;ipated the fears of good men, who dreaded the di&s;|union of the States, and the lo&s;s of our liberties in the death of our enfeebled and expiring Confederation: and now, Sir, by accepting the high authorities of Pre&s;ident of the United States of America, you teach us to expect every ble&s;&s;ing that can re&s;ult from the wi&s;e&s;t recommenda|tions to Congre&s;s, and the mo&s;t prudent and judicious ex|erci&s;e of tho&s;e authorities; thus relieving us, in the one in&s;tance, from the mo&s;t gloomy apprehen&s;ions, as when, in a different capacity, you re-cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware; and in the other, opening to our view the mo&s;t animating pro&s;|pects, as when you captured Cornwallis.</P>
<P>But it is from the tenor of your own life, and your uniform and upright political principles and conduct, that we derive the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urance that our hopes will be re|alized. Believing that a faithful performance of public engagements is e&s;&s;ential to the pro&s;perity of a people, and their implicit reliance on the promi&s;es of government, to

We have al|&s;o every rea&s;on to conclude, that under the admini&s;tration of a WASHINGTON, the u&s;eful and ingenious arts of peace&punc; the agriculture, commerce, and manufactures of the United States, will be duly favoured and improved, as being far more certain &s;ources of national wealth than the riche&s;t mines; and &s;urer means to promote the felicity of a people, than the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful wars. Thus, Sir, we behold a new era &s;pringing out of our independence, and a field di&s;|played, where your talents for governing will not be ob|&s;cured by the &s;plendour of the greate&s;t military exploits. We behold too, an extraordinary thing in the annals of mankind, a free and enlightened people, choo&s;ing, by a free election, without one di&s;&s;enting voice, the late Com|mander in Chief of their armies, to watch over and guard their civil rights and privileges.</P>
<P>We &s;incerely pray that you may long enjoy your pre&s;|ent health, and the citizens of the United States have frequent opportunities to te&s;tify their veneration of your virtues, by continuing you through many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive elec|tions in the fir&s;t &s;tation of human honour and dignity.

It appears to me that little more than common &s;en&s;e and common hone&s;ty in the tran&s;actions of the community at large, would be nece&s;&s;ary to make us a happy nation. For if the general government, lately adopted, &s;hall be arranged and admin|i&s;tered in &s;uch a manner as to acquire the full confidence of the American people, I &s;incerely believe they will have greater advantages from their natural, moral and political circum&s;tances, for public felicity, than any other people ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the contemplation of tho&s;e advantages, now &s;oon to be realized, I have reconciled my&s;elf to the &s;acrifice of my fonde&s;t wi&s;hes, &s;o far as to enter again upon the &s;tage of public life. I know the delicate nature of the duties incident to the part which I am called to perform, and I feel my incompetence, without the &s;ingular a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Providence, to di&s;charge them in a &s;atisfactory manner. But having undertaken the ta&s;k, from a &s;en&s;e of duty, no fear of encountering difficulties, and no dread of lo&s;ing popularity, &s;hall ever deter me from pur&s;uing what I con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ive to be the true intere&s;ts of my country.</P>

<P>THE Pre&s;ident and Supreme Executive Council of Penn&s;ylvania, cheerfully embrace this intere&s;ting oc|ca&s;ion to congratulate you upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Federal Con&s;titution, and to felicitate our&s;elves and our country upon your unanimous appointment to the Pre&s;i|dency of the United States.</P>

<P>In di&s;charging the duties of your pre&s;ent important &s;ta|tion, it mu&s;t, Sir, be a never-failing &s;ource of con&s;olation and &s;upport, that the unbounded love and confidence of the people, will produce a favourable con&s;truction of all your actions, and will contribute to the harmony and &s;uc|ce&s;s of your admini&s;tration.

<P>I RECEIVE with great &s;atisfaction the affectionate congratulations of the Pre&s;ident and Supreme Executive Council of Penn&s;ylvania, on my appointment to the Pre&s;i|dency of the United States.</P>
<P>If, under favour of the Divine Providence, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my fellow-citizens, it was my fortune to have been in any degree in&s;trumental in vindicating the liberty and confirming the independence of my country, I now find a full compen&s;ation for my &s;ervices in a belief that tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings will be permanently &s;ecured by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a free and efficient government. And you will permit me to &s;ay, on this occa&s;ion, that as nothing could add to the evidence I have formerly received of the invariable attachment of your Commonwealth to the intere&s;ts and honour of the Union, &s;o nothing could have

been more agreeable to me at this time than the a&s;&s;urances you have given me of the zealous co-operation of its ex|ecutive authority in facilitating the accompli&s;hment of the great objects which are committed to my charge.</P>
<P>While I feel my &s;en&s;ibility &s;trongly excited by the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of affection and promi&s;es of &s;upport, which I eve|ry where meet with from my countrymen, I entertain a con&s;olatory hope, that the purity of my intentions, and the per&s;everance of my endeavours to promote the happi|ne&s;s of my country, will atone for any of the &s;lighter defects which may be di&s;covered in my admini&s;tration. For, whatever may be the i&s;&s;ue of our public mea&s;ures, or however I may err in opinion, I tru&s;t it will be believed, that I could not have been actuated by any intere&s;ts &s;ep|arate from tho&s;e of my country.</P>
<P>Suffer me, Gentlemen, to conclude by a&s;&s;uring you that I am well plea&s;ed with the ju&s;tice you have done to the motives from which I have acted, and by thanking you for the tender concern you have been plea&s;ed to manife&s;t for my per&s;onal felicity.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding I had mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly determined never more to take any part in tran&s;actions of a public nature, yet a conviction of duty would not &s;uffer me, on the pre&s;|ent occa&s;ion, to refu&s;e a compliance with the unanimous call of my country.</P>

<P>I am not a little flattered by being con&s;idered by the patrons of literature as one of their number. Fully ap|prized of the influence which &s;ound learning has on religion and manners, on government, liberty and laws, I &s;hall only lament my want of ability to make it &s;till more exten|&s;ive, I conceive hopes, however, that we are at the eve of a very enlightened era.

<P>Tho&s;e who know me be&s;t, (and you, my fellow-citizens, are, from your &s;ituation, in that number) know better than any others, my love of retirement is &s;o great, that no earth|ly con&s;ideration, &s;hort of a conviction of duty, could have prevailed upon me to depart from my re&s;olution "never more to take any &s;hare in tran&s;actions of a public nature." For, at my age, and in my circum&s;tances, what po&s;&s;ible ad|vantage could I propo&s;e to my&s;elf, from embarking again in the tempe&s;tuous and uncertain ocean of public life?</P>

<P>We rejoice, Sir, that the citizens of America, &s;o long accu&s;tomed to claim your &s;ervices in every hour of pub|lic difficulty, have again given the mo&s;t affectionate and honourable te&s;timony to your di&s;tingui&s;hed worth, by call|ing you, with united &s;uffrage, to take the highe&s;t &s;eat, of power among&s;t freemen.</P>
<P>When the gloom which overca&s;t the cau&s;e of liberty at the opening of the late war, occa&s;ioned by the alarm of a mighty nation, armed to &s;uppre&s;s the voice of freedom in this infant land, for a moment &s;unk the &s;pirits of its &s;ons&mdash; you. Sir, aro&s;e! in&s;tantaneous confidence po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the minds of your fellow-citizens; under your au&s;pices, they fought, they bled, and, through unparalleled di&s;tre&s;s of war, you led them to freedom, the choice&s;t gift of Heaven.</P>
<P>Scarce had that &s;olemn &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed over, when a tri|umphant victor returned his &s;word to the hands of the civil rulers of his country.</P>
<P>Scarce had you retired to the calm retreat of dome&s;tic peace, when the civil rule, which we had &s;uddenly e&s;tab|li&s;hed amid&s;t the bu&s;y tumult of war, proved unequal to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings to be derived from a well-dige&s;ted Con&s;titution. You, Sir, were again called forth; and, pre|&s;iding over our wi&s;e&s;t councils, have handed to your coun|try a &s;y&s;tem of civil policy, happily uniting civil liberty with effective government.</P>
<P>What then remained undone, is now accompli&s;hed; and you are called to pre&s;ide in di&s;pen&s;ing the ble&s;&s;ings of that government, in the forming of which you took &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a part.</P>
<P>May your admini&s;tration derive ble&s;&s;ings to your coun|try, and honour and happine&s;s to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the name of the citizens of Philadelphia, we bid you welcome; and a&s;&s;ure you, that we, and tho&s;e we repre|&s;ent, have the warme&s;t per&s;onal attachment to you, and &s;hall always rejoice to meet you &s;ingly, or connected with that augu&s;t body over whom you are going to pre&s;ide.</P>

<P>THE affectionate Addre&s;s pre&s;ented by the Magi&s;|trates, and the general joy te&s;tified by the citizens of New York, on my arrival in this metropolis, have filled my mind with the mingled emotions of gratitude and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In accepting the momentous tru&s;t, which has been &s;pon|taneou&s;ly committed to me by a free people, it was not enough to have felt a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted in con|formity to the dictates of patrioti&s;m; it was not enough to have known that I met the wi&s;hes of my fellow-citizens; but it &s;eemed that the&s;e farther pledges were wanting to overcome the diffidence I had in my own abilities, and the reluctance I experienced at engaging in &s;uch new and ar|duous affairs.</P>
<P>Unelated by your too favourable appreciation of my pa&s;t &s;ervices, I can only pour forth the effu&s;ions of a grateful heart to Heaven, if I have been made in any degree an in&s;trument of good to my country.

<P>In this place I cannot avoid expre&s;&s;ing an anxious ap|prehen&s;ion, that the partiality of my countrymen in my fa|vour has induced them to expect too much from the ex|ertions of an individual. It is from their co-operation alone, I derive all my expectations of &s;ucce&s;s. Indeed, the

<P>I feel a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of your &s;ervent wi&s;hes for my per|&s;onal happine&s;s and the &s;ucce&s;s of my admini&s;tration.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE General A&s;&s;embly of the Pre&s;byterian Church, in the United States of America, embrace the earlie&s;t op|portunity in their power, to te&s;tify the lively and un|&s;eigned plea&s;ure which they, with the re&s;t of their fellow-citizens, feel on your appointment to the fir&s;t office in the nation.</P>
<P>We adore Almighty God, the author of every perfect gift, who hath endued you with &s;uch a rare and happy a&s;|&s;emblage of talents, as hath rendered you equally nece&s;&s;a|ry to your country in war and in peace.</P>
<P>Your military achievements en&s;ured &s;afety and glory to America, in the late arduous conflict for freedom;
<PB N="130" REF="031402_0066_0FEF92664A7B2AA0">
while your di&s;intere&s;ted conduct, and uniformly ju&s;t di&s;|cernment of the public intere&s;t, gained you the entire con|fidence of the people. And in the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting period of public affairs, the influence of your per&s;onal character moderates the divi&s;ions of political parties, and promi&s;es a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment of the civil gov|ernment.</P>
<P>From a retirement more glorious to you than thrones and &s;ceptres, you have been called to your pre&s;ent ele|vated &s;tation, by the voice of a great and free people; and with an unanimity of &s;uffrage that has few if any ex|amples in hi&s;tory. A man more ambitious of fame, or le&s;s devoted to his country, would have refu&s;ed an office in which his honours could not be augmented, and where they might po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ubject to a rever&s;e.</P>
<P>We are happy that God hath inclined your heart to give your&s;elf once more to the public. And we derive a favourable pre&s;age of the event from the zeal of all cla&s;&s;es of the people, and their confidence in your virtues; as well as from the knowledge and dignity with which the federal councils are filled. But we derive a pre&s;age even more flattering from the piety of your character. Public virtue is the mo&s;t certain mean of public felicity, and re|ligion is the &s;ure&s;t ba&s;is of virtue. We therefore e&s;teem it a peculiar happine&s;s to behold in our Chief Magi&s;trate a &s;teady, uniform, avowed friend of the Chri&s;tian religion; who has commenced his admini&s;tration in rational and exalted &s;entiments of piety, and who, in his private con|duct, adorns the doctrines of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and on the mo&s;t public and &s;olemn occa&s;ions devoutly ac|knowledges the government of Divine Providence.</P>
<P>The example of di&s;tingui&s;hed characters will ever po&s;|&s;e&s;s a powerful and exten&s;ive influence on the public mind; and when we &s;ee, in &s;uch a con&s;picuous &s;tation, the amia|ble example of piety to God, of benevolence to men, and of a pure and virtuous patrioti&s;m, we naturally hope that it will diffu&s;e its influence, and that eventually the mo&s;t happy con&s;equences will re&s;ult from it. To the force of imitation we will endeavour to add the whole&s;ome in|&s;tructions of religion. We &s;hall con&s;ider our&s;elves as
<PB N="131" REF="031402_0066_0FEF92664A7B2AA0">
doing an acceptable &s;ervice to God in our profe&s;&s;ion, when we contribute to render men &s;ober, hone&s;t, and in|du&s;trious citizens, and the obedient &s;ubjects of a lawful gov|ernment. In the&s;e pious labours, we hope to imitate the mo&s;t worthy of our brethren of other Chri&s;tian denominations, and to be imitated by them; a&s;&s;ured, that if we can, by mutual and generous emulation, promote truth and virtue, we &s;hall render e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the Republic; we &s;hall receive encouragement from every wi&s;e and good citizen, and above all, meet the approbation of our Divine Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>We pray Almighty God to have you always in his holy keeping. May he prolong your valuable life, an or|nament and a ble&s;&s;ing to your country; and at la&s;t be&s;tow on you the glorious reward of a faithful &s;ervant.</P>

<PB N="132" REF="031402_0067_0FEF926B324DC6F0">
I have felt upon finding that my compliance with the call of my country, and my dependence on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven to &s;upport me in my arduous undertakings, have, &s;o far as I can learn, met the univer&s;al approbation of my countrymen.</P>
<P>While I reiterate the profe&s;&s;ions of my dependence upon Heaven as the &s;ource of all public and private ble&s;|&s;ings; I will ob&s;erve that the general prevalence of piety, philanthropy, hone&s;ty, indu&s;try and economy &s;eems, in the ordinary cour&s;e of human affairs, particularly nece&s;&s;ary for advancing and confirming the happine&s;s of our coun|try. While all men within our territories are protected in wor&s;hipping the Deity according to the dictates of their con&s;ciences; it is rationally to be expected from them in return, that they will all be emulous of evincing the &s;incerity of their profe&s;&s;ions, by the innocence of their lives and the beneficence of their actions. For no man who is profligate in his morals, or a bad member of the civil community, can po&s;&s;ibly be a true Chri&s;tian or a cred|it to his own religious &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire you to accept my acknowledgments for your laudable endeavours to render men &s;ober, hone&s;t and good citizens, and the obedient &s;ubjects of a lawful govern|ment; as well as for your prayers to Almighty God for his ble&s;&s;ing on our common country, and the humble in|&s;trument which he has been plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of in the admini&s;tration of its government.</P>

<P>Revolving upon the vici&s;&s;itudes and eventful hi&s;tory of the late war, every page of which bears ample and hon|ourable te&s;timony to the &s;ervices which you have render|ed to your country, and the exertion of tho&s;e virtues and talents which have exalted your name to the fir&s;t rank among the Heroes and Benefactors of mankind; we can|not but recal to mind the occa&s;ion of our former Addre&s;s to you, and your benevolent An&s;wer to the &s;ame.</P>

This happy event, we doubt not, will be accelerated by your Excellency's appointment to the fir&s;t office in the Union, &s;ince we are well a&s;&s;ured the &s;ame greatne&s;s of mind, which in all &s;cenes has &s;o eminently characterized your Excellency, will induce you to advi&s;e every mea&s;ure calculated to compo&s;e party divi&s;ions, and to abate any animo&s;ity that may be excited by a mere difference in opinion. Your Excellency will con&s;ider (however others may forget) how extremely difficult it is to unite all the people of a great country in one common &s;entiment upon almo&s;t any political &s;ubject, much le&s;s upon a new form of government materially different from one they have been accu&s;tomed to, and will therefore rather be di&s;po&s;ed to re|joice that &s;o much has been effected, than regret that more could not all at once be accompli&s;hed. We &s;incerely be|lieve America is the only country in the world where &s;uch a deliberate change of government could take place under any circum&s;tances whatever.</P>
<P>We hope your Excellency will pardon the liberty we take in writing &s;o particularly on this &s;ubject; but this State, however it may differ in any political opinions with the other States, cordially joins with them in &s;entiments of the utmo&s;t gratitude and veneration for tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed talents and that illu&s;trious virtue, which we feel a pride in &s;aying we believe, under God, have been the principal means of pre&s;erving the liberty and procuring the inde|pendence of our country. We cannot help con&s;idering you, Sir, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as the father of it, and hope to experience the good effects of that confidence you &s;o ju&s;tly have acquired, in an abatement of the party &s;pirit which &s;o much endangers a union on which the &s;afety and happine&s;s of America can alone be founded. May that union, at a &s;hort di&s;tance of time, be as perfect and more &s;afe than ever! And in the mean while, may the State of North Carolina be con&s;idered, as it truly de&s;erves

<P>IT was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for any Addre&s;s to have given me greater plea&s;ure than that which I have ju&s;t re|ceived from you; becau&s;e I con&s;ider it not only demon|&s;trative of your approbation of my conduct in accepting the fir&s;t office in the Union, but al&s;o indicative of the good di&s;po&s;itions of the citizens of your State towards their &s;i&s;ter States, and of the probability of their &s;peedily acceding to the new General Government.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tification of the opinion which you are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s of my readine&s;s to advi&s;e every "mea&s;ure calcu|lated to compo&s;e party divi&s;ions, and to abate any animo&s;i|ty that may be excited by mere difference of opinion," I take the liberty of referring you to the &s;entiments com|municated by me, to the two Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s. On this occa&s;ion, I am likewi&s;e happy in being able to add the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that I entertain a well-grounded expectation that nothing will be wanting on the part of the different branches of the General Government to ren|der the union as perfect and more &s;afe than ever it has been.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="031402_0071_0FEF927549C2FA48">A difference of opinion on political points is not to be imputed to freemen as a fault; &s;ince it is to be pre&s;umed that they are all actuated by an equally laudable and &s;a|cred regard for the liberties of their country. If the mind is &s;o formed in different per&s;ons as to con&s;ider the &s;ame object to be &s;omewhat different in its nature and con&s;e|quences, as it happens to be placed in different points of view; and if the olde&s;t, the able&s;t, and the mo&s;t virtuous &s;tate&s;men have often differed in judgment as to the be&s;t forms of government,&mdash;we ought, indeed, rather to rejoice that &s;o much has been effected, than to regret that more could not all at once be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Gratified by the favourable &s;entiments which are evin|ced in your Addre&s;s to me, and impre&s;&s;ed with an idea that the citizens of your State are &s;incerely attached to the intere&s;t, the pro&s;perity, and the glory of America, I mo&s;t earne&s;tly implore the divine benediction and guid|ance in the councils which are &s;hortly to be taken by their delegates on a &s;ubject of the mo&s;t momentous con&s;equence; I mean the political relation which is to &s;ub&s;i&s;t hereafter, between the State of North Carolina, and the States now in union under the new General Government.</P>

<P>WE, the Bi&s;hops, the Clergy, and Laity of the Prot|e&s;tant Epi&s;copal Church in the States of New York, New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, in General Convention a&s;&s;embled, beg leave, with the highe&s;t veneration and the mo&s;t animated national con&s;iderations, at the earlie&s;t moment in our pow|er,

to expre&s;s our cordial joy on your election to the Chief Magi&s;tracy of the United States.</P>
<P>When we contemplate the &s;hort but eventful hi&s;tory of our nation&mdash;when we recollect the &s;eries of e&s;&s;ential &s;er|vices performed by you in the cour&s;e of the revolution, the temperate, yet efficient exertion of the mighty powers with which the nature of the conte&s;t made it nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;t you&mdash;and e&s;pecially when we remember the voluntary and magnanimous relinqui&s;hment of tho&s;e high authorities at the moment of peace&mdash;we anticipate the happine&s;s of our country under your future admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>But it was not alone from a &s;ucce&s;sful and virtuous u&s;e of tho&s;e extraordinary powers that you were called from your honourable retirement, to the fir&s;t dignities, of out government. An affectionate admiration of your private character, the impartiality, the per&s;evering fortitude, and the energy with which your public duties have been in|variably performed, and the paternal &s;olicitude for the happine&s;s of the American people, together with the wi&s;|dom and con&s;ummate knowledge of our affairs, manife&s;ted in your la&s;t military communication, have directed to your name the <HI>univer&s;al wi&s;h,</HI> and have produced, for the fir&s;t time in the hi&s;tory of mankind, an example of <HI>unanimous con&s;ent</HI> in the appointment of the governor of a free and enlightened nation.</P>
<P>To the&s;e con&s;iderations, in&s;piring us with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing expectations, as private citizens, permit us to add, that as the repre&s;entatives of a numerous and extended church, we mo&s;t thankfully rejoice in the election of a civil ruler de&s;ervedly beloved, and eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed among the friends of genuine religion, who has happily united a tender regard for other churches with an inviola|ble attachment to his own.</P>
<P>With unfeigned &s;atisfaction we congratulate you on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the new Con&s;titution of government for the United States, the mild, yet efficient operations of which, we confidently tru&s;t, will remove every remaining apprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e, with who&s;e opinions it may not en|tirely coincide, and will confirm the hopes of its numerous friends. Nor do the&s;e expectations appear too &s;anguine,

when the moderation, patrioti&s;m, and wi&s;dom of the hon|ourable members of the federal legi&s;lature are duly con&s;id|ered.</P>
<P>From a body thus eminently qualified, harmoniou&s;ly co-operating with the executive authority in con&s;titutional concert, we confidently hope for the re&s;toration of order and our ancient virtues; the exten&s;ion of genuine religion, and the con&s;equent advancement of our re&s;pectability a|broad, and of our &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s at home.</P>
<P>We devoutly implore the Supreme Ruler of the Uni|ver&s;e to pre&s;erve you long in health and pro&s;perity an ani|mating example of all public and private virtues&mdash;the friend and guardian of a free, enlightened, and grateful people; and that you may finally receive the reward which will be given to tho&s;e, who&s;e lives have been &s;pent in promoting the happine&s;s of mankind.</P>

<P>I SINCERELY thank you for your affectionate congratulations, on my election to the Chief Magi&s;tracy of the United States.</P>
<P>After having received from my fellow-citizens in gen|eral the mo&s;t liberal treatment&mdash;after having found them di&s;po&s;ed to contemplate, in the mo&s;t flattering point of view, the performance of my military &s;ervices, and the manner of my retirement at the clo&s;e of the war, I feel that I have a right to con&s;ole my&s;elf, in my pre&s;ent ardu|ous undertakings, with a hope that they will &s;till be incli|ned to put the mo&s;t favourable con&s;tructions on the motives which may influence me in my future public tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>The &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from the indulgent opinion en|tertained by the American people of my conduct, will, I tru&s;t, be &s;ome &s;ecurity for preventing me from doing any thing which might ju&s;tly incur the forfeiture of that opinion. And the con&s;ideration that human happine&s;s and moral duty are in&s;eparably connected, will always continue to prompt me to promote the progre&s;s of the former, by inculcating the practice of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="031402_0074_0FEF927E1F962E80">On this occa&s;ion it will ill become me to conceal the joy I have felt in perceiving the fraternal affection which appears to increa&s;e every day among the friends of genuine religion.

<P>THE Repre&s;entatives of a free people cannot comply with their duty to their con&s;tituents more to their &s;ati&s;|faction, than by paying a ju&s;t tribute to the merits of one, who&s;e important exertions, unexampled per&s;everance, and di&s;tingui&s;hed military talents, have eminently contributed to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their liberties.

<P>The citizens of this State, having been among the fir&s;t to adopt the &s;y&s;tem of federal government on which they &s;o much depend for their portion of the national pro&s;per|ity, cannot but be highly gratified by the progre&s;s which has been made towards its complete organization; and they have a plea&s;ing addition to their &s;atisfaction, by your having been &s;o unanimou&s;ly placed at the head of it.

<P>We deem it a circum&s;tance which &s;trongly marks the good &s;en&s;e and virtue of our countrymen, that they peace|ably and deliberately concurred in a frame of general gov|ernment, which, we firmly tru&s;t, will, in its operation,

To obtain this de&s;irable end, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the government of laws, the union of the&s;e States is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; therefore, in every proceed|ing, this great, this important object &s;hould ever be kept in view; &s;o long as our mea&s;ures tend to this, and are marked with the wi&s;dom of a well-informed, enlightened people, we may rea&s;onably hope, under the &s;miles of Heaven, to convince the world, that the happine&s;s of na|tions can be accompli&s;hed by pacific revolutions in their political &s;y&s;tems, without the de&s;tructive intervention of the &s;word.</P>
<P>Your wi&s;hes for my per&s;onal happine&s;s, and fervent prayers for the pre&s;ervation of my exi&s;tence, have made a grateful impre&s;&s;ion upon me; and I &s;hall not fail to im|plore the Divine Author of the Univer&s;e to be&s;tow tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings upon you and your con&s;tituents that can make a people happy.</P>

<P>We have rea&s;on to rejoice in the pro&s;pect, that the na|tional government which by the favour of divine Provi|dence was formed by the common councils, and peaceably e&s;tabli&s;hed with the common con&s;ent of the people, will prove a ble&s;&s;ing to every denomination of them; to ren|der it &s;uch my be&s;t endeavours &s;hall not be wanting. Gov|ernment being among other purpo&s;es in&s;tituted to protect the per&s;ons and con&s;ciences of men from oppre&s;&s;ion, it cer|tainly is the duty of rulers not only to ab&s;tain from it them&s;elves, but according to their &s;tations to prevent it in others.</P>
<P>The liberty enjoyed by the people of the&s;e States of wor|&s;hipping Almighty God agreeably to their con&s;ciences, is not only among the choice&s;t of their ble&s;&s;ings, but al&s;o of their rights. While men perform their &s;ocial duties faithfully, they do all that &s;ociety or the State can with propriety ex|pect or demand, and remain re&s;pon&s;ible only to their Ma|ker

for the religion or mode of faith which they may pre|fer or profe&s;s. Your principles and conduct are well known to me, and it is doing the people called Quakers no more than ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that (except their declining to &s;hare with others the burthens of the common defence) there is no denomination among us who are more exem|plary and u&s;eful citizens. I a&s;&s;ure you very explicitly that in my opinion the con&s;cientious &s;cruples of all men &s;hould be treated with great delicacy and tenderne&s;s; and it is my wi&s;h and de&s;ire that the laws may always be as exten&s;ively accommodated to them as a due regard to the protection and e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the nation may ju&s;tify and permit.</P>

<P>We cannot forbear expre&s;&s;ing our gratitude to God for pre&s;erving your valuable life amid&s;t &s;o many dangers till this time; for in&s;piring you with a large portion of the martial &s;pirit, and forming you al&s;o for the milder and more agreeable arts of government and peace; for en|dowing you with great virtues, and calling them into ex|erci&s;e by great events; for di&s;tingui&s;hing you with honours, and giving you remarkable prudence and mod|eration;

and for making your extraordinary talents the more con&s;picuous, u&s;eful and durable, by &s;uperinducing the noble ornament of humility. Your country has, with one voice, atte&s;ted your excellence by inviting you again to public life, and you have confirmed its judgment by re|turning to fre&s;h &s;cenes and toils after you had retired to the &s;hade from the burden and heat of a long day.</P>
<P>Among the many &s;ignal interpo&s;itions of Divine Prov|idence, we remark the late important change in the Gen|eral Government; a change neither effected by accident, nor impo&s;ed by force; but adopted in the bo&s;om of peace, after a free and mature deliberation; and in which a peo|ple widely extended, and various in their habits, are united beyond the mo&s;t rai&s;ed expectations. In the&s;e re|&s;pects the United States of America &s;tand &s;ingle among all the nations of the earth. Other revolutions may have been more diver&s;ified and &s;plendid, but none more honourable to human nature, and none &s;o likely to produce &s;uch happy effects. This government being now completely organiz|ed, and all its departments filled, we tru&s;t that, God will give wi&s;dom to its councils, and ju&s;tice to its admini&s;tra|tion; and that we &s;hall at length realize tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which animated our hopes through a difficult and ruinous war.</P>
<P>To our con&s;tant prayers for the welfare of our country, and of the whole human race, we &s;hall e&s;teem it our duty and happine&s;s, to unite our earne&s;t endeavours to promote the pure and undefiled religion of Chri&s;t; for as this &s;e|cures eternal felicity to men in a future &s;tate, &s;o we are per&s;uaded that good Chri&s;tians will always be good citi|zens, and that where righteou&s;ne&s;s prevails among indi|viduals, the nation will be great and happy. Thus while ju&s;t government protects all in their religious rights, true religion affords to government its &s;ure&s;t &s;upport.</P>
<P>We implore the Lord God to be your &s;un and &s;hield, May your admini&s;tration be pro&s;perous. May the ble&s;|&s;ings of millions come upon you, and your name be grate|ful to all po&s;terity. Above all, may you fini&s;h your cour&s;e

We were fully per&s;uaded, that the Man, who during &s;o great a length of time, and in the mo&s;t try|ing circum&s;tances, had been accepted by the multitude of his brethren, would, in this new &s;tation, enjoy their entire confidence, and en&s;ure their highe&s;t e&s;teem; nor have we been di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>Permit us, Sir, to congratulate you on the happy e&s;tab|li&s;hment of the Government of the Union, on the patri|oti&s;m and wi&s;dom, which have marked its public tran&s;|actions, and the very general approbation, which the peo|ple have given to its mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, Sir, being fully &s;en&s;ible that you are &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the nece&s;&s;ity of religion, virtue and &s;olid learning, for &s;upporting freedom and good govern|ment, and fixing the happine&s;s of the people upon a firm and permanent ba&s;is, we beg leave to recommend to your favourable notice, the Univer&s;ity entru&s;ted to our care, which was early founded for promoting the&s;e important ends.</P>
<P>When you took the command of the troops of your country, you &s;aw the Univer&s;ity in a &s;tate of depre&s;&s;ion&mdash; its members di&s;per&s;ed&mdash;its literary trea&s;ures removed&mdash;and the Mu&s;es fled from the din of arms, then heard within its

Happily re&s;tored, in the cour&s;e of a few months, by your glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es, to its former privileges, and to a &s;tate of tranquillity, it received its returning members; and our youth have &s;ince pur&s;ued, without interruption, their literary cour&s;es, and fitted them&s;elves for u&s;efulne&s;s in Church and State. The public rooms, which you for|merly &s;aw empty, are now repleni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;ary means of improving the human mind in literature and &s;cience; and every thing within the walls wears the a&s;pect of peace, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the cultivation of the liberal arts.</P>
<P>While we exert our&s;elves, in our corporate capacity, to promote the great objects of this in&s;titution, we re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of your protection and patronage.</P>
<P>We wi&s;h you, Sir, the aid and &s;upport of Heaven, while you are di&s;charging the duties of your mo&s;t impor|tant &s;tation. May your &s;ucce&s;s, in promoting the be&s;t in|tere&s;ts of the nation, be equal to your highe&s;t wi&s;hes!

<P>WE beg leave to expre&s;s our happine&s;s in the honour you confer upon us by your vi&s;it to this capital.</P>
<P>We are happy in the opportunity of again making our per&s;onal acknowledgments to a character, to which, on every principle, we are &s;o deeply indebted.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="031402_0091_0FEF8ED5F8DBADE8">Every motive of e&s;teem, duty and affection have con|&s;pired to form in our minds the &s;tronge&s;t attachment that the free&s;t people can feel to the mo&s;t de&s;erving citizen.</P>
<P>As men, we have long &s;ince con&s;idered you, under God, as the great and glorious Avenger of the violated rights of humanity&mdash;as citizens, we have ob&s;erved with peculiar &s;at|isfaction, that you have unvariably re&s;pected tho&s;e liberties, which you have &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully defended&mdash;and as inhab|itants of a great commercial town, we attribute the &s;ecu|rity we enjoy to the &s;ingular merit and &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, in the progre&s;s of the war, which you had the honour to conduct.</P>
<P>It cannot but afford you the highe&s;t plea&s;ure, when you compare our pre&s;ent &s;ituation with the &s;ignal di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which we were expo&s;ed during the period in which this town was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an exa&s;perated enemy. In|dignant at the multiplied re&s;traints of ho&s;tile domination, we &s;ought an a&s;ylum among our friends and connections in the country, and cheerfully abandoned our property and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the common cau&s;e of America&mdash;that we were &s;o &s;oon happily rein&s;tated, may be ju&s;tly imputed to the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e arrangements which compelled our invaders, in their retreat, to adopt a le&s;s de&s;tructive policy than that, which on other occa&s;ions, they &s;o wantonly practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>In every trying vici&s;&s;itude, we have remarked the con|&s;picuous and unaffected piety of your heart, and the wi&s;dom and moderation of your coun&s;els.</P>
<P>We have &s;een you relinqui&s;h the ea&s;e and independence of private fortune to lead in the untried dangers of a war, at the ri&s;que of your life and reputation. With plea&s;ure we have viewed you retiring in victory, and exhibiting a new example of patriotic virtue to an admiring world; and we now feel a &s;till higher &s;atisfaction at your having once more &s;acrificed the &s;weets of dome&s;tic retirement in obedience to the united voice of your countrymen.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are the &s;entiments and reflections which nat|urally occur on an attentive con&s;ideration of your pa&s;t conduct. To the future we look for tho&s;e virtues which adorn the Man, and mark the wi&s;e and accompli&s;hed

<P>With the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, the pre&s;ervation of your life through the varied &s;cenes in which you have been enga|ged, demands our grateful acknowledgments to the benefi|cent Di&s;po&s;er of human events.</P>

<P>The ble&s;&s;ings of Independence and a Republican Gov|ernment mu&s;t ever excite our gratitude and affection to &s;o eminent a Supporter of the Public Liberty, who&s;e wi&s;dom and valor have &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully defended the rights of his country. The e&s;tabli&s;hment, by the United States, of a &s;ecure and efficient government, gives us the plea&s;ing ex|pectation of the gradual revival of our fi&s;hery and com|merce&mdash;objects of the indu&s;try, and principal means of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, of the inhabitants of this place, for above a century previous to the late revolution.

The return of peace did not re&s;tore to us the former ad|vantages of the fi&s;hery, which hath remained under pecu|liar di&s;couragements: and we have yet patiently to expect that attention of the General Government, which may remedy the&s;e evils, and which the &s;ubject may de&s;erve, from its exten&s;ive importance to the commerce of the United States.</P>

<P>Plea&s;ing were their reflections, that he, who, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, had given them their independence, would again relinqui&s;h the felicities of dome&s;tic retirement, to teach them its ju&s;t value.</P>
<P>They have &s;een you, victorious, leave the field, follow|ed with the applau&s;es of a grateful country; and they now &s;ee you entwining the olive with the laurel, and, in peace, giving &s;ecurity and happine&s;s to a people, whom, in war, you covered with glory.</P>

<P>They cannot hope, Sir, to exhibit any peculiar marks of attachment to your per&s;on; for, could they expre&s;s their feelings of the mo&s;t ardent and &s;incere gratitude, they would only repeat the &s;entiments, which are deeply impre&s;&s;ed upon the hearts of all their fellow-citizens: but in ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, they beg leave to a&s;&s;ure you, that, in no part of the United States are tho&s;e &s;entiments of gratitude and affection more cordial and animated, than in the town, which at this time is honoured with your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Long, Sir, may you continue the ornament and &s;up|port of the&s;e States, and may the period be late, when you &s;hall be called to receive a reward adequate to your virtues, which it is not in the power of your country to be&s;tow.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SENSIBLE of the honour done them by this vi&s;it from your Excellency, the inhabitants of Port&s;mouth improve this fir&s;t opportunity of bidding you welcome to New Hamp&s;hire; and beg leave to mingle their warme&s;t con|gratulations with tho&s;e of their brethren throughout the Union, upon your election to the high and important of|fice of Pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>We attempt not to recount the number, variety and merit, of your &s;ervices to our common country; the&s;e are already written in indelible characters on the heart of every true American, which the faithful page of hi&s;tory will tran&s;mit to generations unborn: but to expre&s;s our grati|tude to him, who with a magnanimity peculiar to him&s;elf, under the &s;miles of Heaven, defended the rights, and gave birth to the empire of America. Permit us to add the grateful &s;en&s;e we entertain of our high obligations to you, Sir, as a town, for our &s;ecurity from that deva&s;tation which was the fate of many other &s;ea-port towns in the Union, and would probably have been our's, had not the enemy, by your wi&s;e and &s;pirited exertions, been driven
<PB N="190" REF="031402_0096_0FEF92BFED680218">
from the capital of a neighbouring State, and compelled to &s;eek an a&s;ylum, for a while, within their own do|minions.</P>
<P>Our happy e&s;cape from this calamity, while it demands our devout a&s;criptions of prai&s;e to the great Ruler of all events, con&s;oles us under the many heavy lo&s;&s;es we have &s;u&s;tained in our navigation and commerce during the war, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing effects of which we &s;till but too &s;en&s;ibly feel.</P>
<P>It is with plea&s;ing emotions, we recognize the di&s;pen|&s;ations of Divine Providence towards the United States, in placing the Deliverer of his country at the head of the General Government by the unanimous &s;uffrages of a free and grateful people, at a cri&s;is when none but the man who has long enjoyed, and richly merited, the confidence of America, and the plaudits of an enlightened world, could be found equal to the arduous ta&s;k.</P>
<P>We felicitate you, and the&s;e States, on your &s;peedy recovery from your late &s;ickne&s;s, and ardently wi&s;h your life may be continued a ble&s;&s;ing to your&s;elf, and your country, and that at &s;ome far di&s;tant period, full of years, and the mo&s;t benevolent and glorious achievements, em|balmed with the tears of grateful millions, you may be called to inherit an incorruptible crown in the realms of glory.</P>

<P>I can claim no particular merit, Gentlemen, for the pre&s;ervation of your town from the deva&s;tation of the enemy.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Legi&s;lature of New Jer&s;ey, although fully &s;en&s;ible of the trouble and interruption occa&s;ioned by the numer|ous Addre&s;&s;es of congratulation, on your acceptance of the highe&s;t office in the Commonwealth, would neither forgive them&s;elves, nor expect the pardon of their con|&s;tituents, &s;hould they neglect, in this their fir&s;t meeting, after the organization of the Federal Government, to expre&s;s their joy, on &s;eeing you at the head of the United States.</P>
<P>New Jer&s;ey having been the central theatre of the late war, and the &s;cene of &s;ome of the mo&s;t important mili|tary operations, which di&s;tingui&s;hed the American ar|mies, and added new honours to their illu&s;trious Com|mander, we are particularly induced to commemorate tho&s;e brilliant exploits, which, while they immortalized your name, afforded peace and &s;ecurity to the inhabitants of the State.</P>
<P>Adulation, Sir, we are as much indi&s;po&s;ed to offer, as you can be di&s;inclined to receive; but while we add our voice to that of the world, in celebrating your military achievements, we cannot refrain from acknowledging the attention, which you have always paid to the laws of the State, and your inflexible per&s;everance, amid&s;t all the dire nece&s;&s;ities of war, in preferring the rights of the citi|zen to the convenience of the &s;oldier; thus, while equal to the mo&s;t renowned warriors as a hero, you have proved your&s;elf &s;uperior to them as a citizen.</P>
<P>As New Jer&s;ey was early and unanimous in adopting the Con&s;titution, under which you rule&mdash;as every voice called you forth to the office of Chief Magi&s;trate, and every per&s;on looks up to it and you for protection, pro&s;|perity, and good government,&mdash;we may, we tru&s;t, a&s;&s;ure you,

that the citizens of this State will, to the utmo&s;t of their abilities, ever &s;trengthen and &s;upport you in the di&s;charge of your high and momentous tru&s;t.</P>
<P>We have rea&s;on to adore the Divine Providence, in rai&s;ing up for us a Leader and Ruler, &s;o perfectly &s;uited to our &s;ituation and circum&s;tances; and &s;incerely believe, that great and important as your &s;ervices have been, you will not derive more honour therefrom, than from your humility and &s;elf-denial, in mode&s;tly a&s;cribing all, as you con&s;tantly have done, to the power and wi&s;dom of the Mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>We earne&s;tly pray, that the &s;ame kind Providence which has conducted you with &s;o much honour to your&s;elf, and &s;uch un&s;peakable felicity to the public, may long continue you a ble&s;&s;ing to the United States, in your pre&s;ent impor|tant office, and at la&s;t crown you with that palm of victo|ry, which is promi&s;ed to tho&s;e, who by Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hall finally prove to be more than conquerors.</P>

<P>IN replying to the flattering and affectionate Ad|dre&s;s, with which you are plea&s;ed to honour me, I con|fe&s;s a want of expre&s;&s;ion to convey the grateful &s;entiment which it in&s;pires. You will do ju&s;tice to tho&s;e &s;entiments,

by believing that they are founded in &s;incere regard, and re&s;pectful e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The opportunities which were afforded me, in the trying vici&s;&s;itudes of our arduous &s;truggle, to remark the generous &s;pirit, which animated the exertions of your cit|izens, have impre&s;&s;ed a remembrance of their worth, which no length of time, or change of circum&s;tances, can efface.</P>
<P>To the gallantry and firmne&s;s of their efforts in the Field, they have added the wi&s;dom and liberality of di&s;|tingui&s;hed patrioti&s;m in Council. Appreciating, with ju|dicious di&s;cernment, the ble&s;&s;ings of that independence, which their efforts contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h, they were unanimou&s;ly agreed to &s;ecure and perpetuate them, by adopting a Con&s;titution, which promi&s;ed equal and efficient protection to the privileges of Confederated America.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;urance now given by your honorable body, to &s;upport the federal &s;y&s;tem, is a renewed proof of the e&s;ti|mation in which it is held, and a happy indication of the beneficial effects already experienced, and hereafter ex|pected to flow from its operations. As &s;uch it is to me peculiarly grateful, and mu&s;t be &s;o to every citizen of the Union, who&s;e wi&s;h is private pro&s;perity and public honour.</P>
<P>Allow me, Gentlemen, to a&s;&s;ure you of every endeav|our on my part, to promote the&s;e de&s;irable objects.</P>
<P>In making my acknowledgments for the favourable opin|ions you expre&s;s of my military conduct, as it re&s;pected the ob&s;ervance of civil rights, it is ju&s;tice to a&s;&s;ign great merit to the temper of tho&s;e citizens, who&s;e e&s;tates were more immediately the &s;cene of warfare. Their per&s;onal &s;ervices were rendered without con&s;traint, and the de|rangement of their affairs &s;ubmitted to without di&s;&s;ati&s;|isfaction. It was the triumph of patrioti&s;m over per&s;onal con&s;ideration, and our pre&s;ent enjoyment of peace and freedom reward the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Imploring a continuance of the&s;e enjoyments to our country, and individual happine&s;s to the citizens who procured them, I offer up a &s;incere prayer for you, Gen|tlemen, and your con&s;tituents.</P>

<P>POSSESSED of every feeling that can act on grate|ful hearts, the Society of the Cincinnati e&s;tabli&s;hed in the State of South Carolina, beg leave to congratulate you on the happy occa&s;ion which has once again placed you in a &s;ituation of rendering general good to their country.</P>
<P>Retired from the bu&s;y &s;cenes of life, to reap the rewards of your virtuous acts, and to enjoy the glory you had al|ready obtained, your fellow-citizens received you with ex|ulting happine&s;s; they &s;aw in you the patriot-hero, the friend and &s;aviour of their country; and with hearts-filled with gratitude and affection, they invoked the Allwi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of human events to render that retirement happy.</P>
<P>The period, however, arrived when the abilities of the virtuous patriot were again to be called forth to a&s;&s;ume a public character. A general political government was formed, by which the happine&s;s of the country for who&s;e liberty you had fought, was now to be e&s;tabli&s;hed.

They had experienced his abilities, they had experienced his integrity, and his inviolable love for his country. Nor did they &s;eek in vain.

<P>FROM a conviction that the di&s;po&s;itions of the Society of the Cincinnati e&s;tabli&s;hed in the State of South Carolina are peculiarly friendly to me, I cannot receive their congratulations on the occa&s;ion which gave birth to their Addre&s;s, without emotions of peculiar &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t that my fellow-citizens &s;o kindly took in the happine&s;s which they &s;aw me enjoy in my retirement after the war, is rather to be attributed to their great par|tiality in my favour, than to any &s;ingular title I had to their gratitude and affection.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding I was con&s;cious that my abilities had been too highly appreciated; yet I felt, that, whatever they were, my country had a ju&s;t claim upon me, when|ever the exerci&s;e of them &s;hould be deemed conducive to its welfare. With &s;uch feelings, I could not refu&s;e to obey that voice which I had always been accu&s;tomed to re&s;pect, nor he&s;itate to forego a re&s;olution which I had
<PB N="199" REF="031402_0100_0FEF92CA910EBAD0">
formed of pa&s;&s;ing the remainder of my days in retirement. And &s;o far am I from having rea&s;on to repent of the de|cided mea&s;ure I took, in the cri&s;is of organizing a new general government, that I ought rather, perhaps, to felicitate my&s;elf upon having met the wi&s;hes, and experi|enced the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a patriotic and enlightened people, in my arduous undertaking.</P>
<P>Always &s;atisfied that I &s;hould be &s;upported in the ad|mini&s;tration of my office, by the friends of good govern|ment in general, I counted upon the favourable &s;entiment and conduct of the officers of the late army in particular. Nor has my expectation been deceived. As they were formerly di&s;tingui&s;hed by their eminent fortitude and pat|rioti&s;m in their military &s;ervice, during the mo&s;t trying occa&s;ions, &s;o are the &s;ame men now, mingled in the ma&s;s of citizens, con&s;picuous for a di&s;intere&s;ted love of order, and a jealous attention to the pre&s;ervation of the rights of mankind. Nor is it conceivable that any members of the community &s;hould be more worthy of the enjoyment of liberty, or more zealous to perpetuate its duration, than tho&s;e who have &s;o nobly and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully defended its &s;tandard in the new world.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely thank you, Gentlemen, for your expre&s;&s;ion of attachment to my per&s;on, and wi&s;h for my happine&s;s and honour. On my part, I only dare to engage, it &s;hall be my ince&s;&s;ant &s;tudy, that you may happily experience and long enjoy the fruits of a government, which has for its ba&s;is the good of the American people.</P>

<P>WE have been long impatient to te&s;tify our joy and unbounded confidence on your being called, by an unani|mous vote, to the fir&s;t &s;tation of a country, in which that unanimity could not have been obtained without the previous merit of unexampled &s;ervices, of eminent wi&s;|dom, and unblemi&s;hed virtue. Our congratulations have not reached you &s;ooner, becau&s;e our &s;cattered &s;ituation prevented the communication and the collecting of tho&s;e &s;entiments, which warmed every brea&s;t. But the delay has furni&s;hed us with the opportunity, not merely of pre|&s;aging the happine&s;s to be expected under your admini&s;|tration, but of bearing te&s;timony to that which we ex|perience already. It is your peculiar talent, in war and in peace, to afford &s;ecurity to tho&s;e, who commit their protection into your hands. In war, you &s;hield them from the ravages of armed ho&s;tility: in peace, you e&s;tab|li&s;h public tranquility, by the ju&s;tice and moderation, not le&s;s than by the vigour of your government. By example as well as by vigilance, you extend the influence of laws on the manners of our fellow-citizens. You encourage re|&s;pect for religion, and inculcate by words and actions, that principle on which the welfare of nations &s;o much de|pends, that a &s;uperintending Providence governs the events of the world, and watches over the conduct of men. Your exalted maxims, and unwearied attention to the moral and phy&s;ical improvement of our country have produced already the happie&s;t effects. Under your ad|mini&s;tration, America is animated with zeal for the at|tainment and encouragement of u&s;eful literature; &s;he im|proves her agriculture, extends her commerce, and ac|quires
<PB N="201" REF="031402_0101_0FEF932FC16C8C38">
with foreign nations a dignity unknown to her be|fore. From the&s;e happy events, in which none can feel a warmer intere&s;t than our&s;elves, we derive additional plea&s;|ure by recollecting that you, Sir, have been the principal in&s;trument to effect &s;o rapid a change in our political &s;itu|ation. This pro&s;pect of national pro&s;perity is peculiarly plea&s;ing to us on another account; becau&s;e whil&s;t our country pre&s;erves her freedom and independence, we &s;hall have a well-founded title to claim from her ju&s;tice the equal rights of citizen&s;hip, as the price of our blood &s;pilt under your eyes, and of our common exertions for her defence, under your au&s;picious conduct; rights rendered more dear to us by the remembrance of former hard&s;hips. When we pray for the pre&s;ervation of them, where they have been granted; and expect the full exten&s;ion of them from the ju&s;tice of tho&s;e States which &s;till re&s;trict them; when we &s;olicit the protection of Heaven over our com|mon country, we neither omit, or can omit recommend|ing your pre&s;ervation to the &s;ingular care of Divine Prov|idence; becau&s;e we conceive that no human means are &s;o available to promote the welfare of the United States, as the prolongation of your health and life, in which are included the energy of your example, the wi&s;dom of your coun&s;els, and the per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence of your virtues.</P>

America, under the &s;miles of a Divine Providence, the protection of a good government, and the cultivation of manners, morals, and piety, cannot fail of attaining an uncommon degree of eminence, in litera|ture, commerce, agriculture, improvements at home and re&s;pectability abroad.</P>
<P>As mankind become more liberal they will be more apt to allow, that all tho&s;e who conduct them&s;elves as worthy members of the community are equally entitled to the protection of civil government. I hope ever to &s;ee America among the foremo&s;t nations in examples of ju&s;|tice

<P>I thank you, Gentlemen, for your kind concern for me. While my life and my health &s;hall continue, in whatever &s;ituation I may be, it &s;hall be my con&s;tant en|deavour to ju&s;tify the favourable &s;entiments which you are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s of my conduct.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Federal Con&s;titution being adopted, it became the wi&s;h of the people of this State that you &s;hould be elevated to the Pre&s;idency of the Union; and the two branches of the Legi&s;lature take the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of of|fering to your acceptance their congratulations on the unanimity of your election.</P>
<P>In the great concerns of mankind, &s;ucce&s;s has not al|ways been attendant on the performance of duty; and where it has, the &s;anction of public approbation has fre|quently been withheld; but it was re&s;erved for you, in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t arduous difficulties, not only to
<PB N="204" REF="031402_0103_0FEF92D0E58F66F8">
be &s;ucce&s;sful, but to have been &s;o with univer&s;al ap|plau&s;e.</P>
<P>Rai&s;ed by your virtues and &s;ervices to the head of a government, pervading &s;o many independent States, the general confidence is in favour of your ju&s;tice; and, while the hi&s;tory of nations informs that the errors of rulers have often proceeded from the want of information, we &s;hall not he&s;itate to lay before you &s;uch facts and opinions re&s;pecting this State, as may appear to us to be incum|bent or nece&s;&s;ary. In doing this, it &s;hall be our aim to unite plainne&s;s with re&s;pect, and integrity with truth.</P>
<P>Sir, in the cour&s;e of the war which e&s;tabli&s;hed our independence, our citizens made proportionate exertions with tho&s;e of any part of the whole, and, in point of property, they &s;uffered the mo&s;t. The peace found the country a wa&s;te. With many natural advantages, we flat|tered our&s;elves with a &s;peedy recovery, when we were attacked by the Indians.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject we wi&s;h to be delicate. Much has been already &s;aid&mdash;we have a&s;&s;erted, and it has been contra|dicted. Removed at a di&s;tance from the centre, our ac|tions have been liable to mi&s;repre&s;entation; but we tru&s;t that by this time, they are better explained; in the mean while, our population has been checked, and our agricul|ture dimini&s;hed&mdash;the blood of our citizens has been &s;pill|ed, our public re&s;ources greatly exhau&s;ted; and our fron|tiers &s;till open to fre&s;h ravages. The failure of the late negociation for a peace with the Creek Indians, and the circum&s;tances which attended the &s;ame, are the be&s;t evi|dence of the nece&s;&s;ity of our mea&s;ures, and a proof of the late ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e people; but under the in|fluence of the government and power of the Union, it is to be hoped and expected that a different conduct will on their part prevail: on our part, nothing &s;hall be wanting to promote &s;o de&s;irable an e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance of additional calamity attendant on our being the &s;outh frontier of the Union, is, the fa|cility of our black people cro&s;&s;ing the Spani&s;h line, from whence we have never been able to reclaim them. This has already been productive of much injury to private per|&s;ons,
<PB N="205" REF="031402_0103_0FEF92D0E58F66F8">
and if not &s;peedily re&s;trained, may grow into an evil of national magnitude.</P>
<P>We take this occa&s;ion of bringing this bu&s;ine&s;s into view, with a perfect reliance, that you will cau&s;e &s;uch di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions to be made, as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to bring about a remedy.</P>
<P>We reque&s;t you will accept our cordial wi&s;hes for your health and happine&s;s, and that you may long continue to enjoy that confidence which has been &s;o eminently placed in you by the people of the United States.</P>

<P>THE congratulations pre&s;ented to me by the differ|ent branches of the Legi&s;lature of the State of Georgia, upon my having been elected with unanimity to the Pre&s;idency of the United States, affect my mind with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, and demand my be&s;t ac|knowledgments.</P>
<P>From the ob&s;ervation, that, in the great concerns of mankind, &s;ucce&s;s has not always been attendant on the performance of duty, and that, where it has, the &s;anction of public approbation has frequently been withheld; I am naturally led to reflect on the unlimited gratitude which we owe, as a nation, to the Supreme Arbiter of human events for his interpo&s;ition in our favour, as well as on the &s;ingular obligations which are due from me, as an in|dividual,
<PB N="206" REF="031402_0104_0FEF92D4ED51DE20">

For I am duly &s;en&s;ible that many errors which would re&s;ult from want of information, may be obviated by timely and ju&s;t repre&s;entations.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant how much the local &s;ituation of your State expo&s;ed its inhabitants to &s;uffer the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the late war in a &s;evere manner; nor how manfully they ex|erted them&s;elves in defence of the common cau&s;e, during the &s;truggle which e&s;tabli&s;hed our independence. Wa&s;ted as your country was at the return of peace, and expo&s;ed as your frontiers have &s;ince been to the ravages of the Indians, I cannot but flatter my&s;elf that you will ere long realize the ble&s;&s;ings which were to be expected from your natural re&s;ources, and find a compen&s;ation for your &s;ufferings in the benefits of an efficient General Gov|ernment.</P>
<P>It will not be expected, I pre&s;ume, on this occa&s;ion, that I &s;hould enter into the merits of the delicate &s;ubject to which you allude. It may be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that while I regret extremely the failure of the late negocia|tion for peace with the Creek Indians, I am &s;atisfied that the explanations which have been obtained through au|thentic channels will be of eminent &s;ervice. I am al&s;o convinced that nothing will be wanting on your part to concur in the accompli&s;hment of a pacification; and I &s;till hope, that under the influence of the General Gov|ernment that de&s;irable object may be effected. With re&s;pect to this &s;ubject in general, as well as to the other calamity which you mentioned as re&s;ulting from your being the &s;outh frontier of the Union, I reque&s;t you will he per&s;uaded that I &s;hall make &s;uch u&s;e of the powers

<P>A good Con&s;titution was the object for which we ri&s;k|ed our lives, and experienced unparalleled difficulties.

<P>In addition to that reward for your &s;ufferings and &s;er|vices which ari&s;es from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done your duty, you have erected monuments more expre&s;&s;ive of your merits than even the univer&s;al applau&s;e of your country, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of its independence and &s;ove|reignty.

<P>Whatever titles my military &s;ervices may have given me to the regard of my country, they are principally corrobo|rated by the firm &s;upport of my brave and faithful a&s;&s;ociates in the field.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE, the people of the State of South Carolina, now met and &s;itting in Convention, beg leave to addre&s;s you, and to embrace this fir&s;t opportunity which has been af|forded us of congratulating you on the high and important &s;tation of Pre&s;ident of the United States. Such, Sir, has been the impre&s;&s;ion made upon the public mind by a due &s;en&s;e of your eminent &s;ervices, and &s;uch the affection of a nation, who&s;e deare&s;t rights you have defended, that one wi&s;h pervaded the whole continent, of placing you at the head of the Federal Republic, and of enjoying under your protection, as our Fir&s;t Magi&s;trate, the ble&s;&s;ings of that free government, for the attainment of which we are &s;o much indebted to your exertions as our General. The promi&s;es of your earlier life, Sir, had prepared your fellow-citizens for your acceptance of the military command in 1775, when dangers and difficulties &s;urrounded us on all &s;ides, and the pro&s;pect was dark and gloomy; but they mu&s;t ever re|member with gratitude and admiration the wi&s;dom and energy of that &s;y&s;tem, which could induce men accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t perfect equality to &s;ubmit to the rigorous duties of a camp, and thus convert the tumultuary array of an undi&s;ciplined yeomanry into a permanent force,
<PB N="211" REF="031402_0106_0FEF92D82C0ACF90">
capable of making head again&s;t the veteran army of our enemies. With &s;imilar &s;entiments do they call to mind the efforts of that heroic fortitude, which de&s;paired not in the wor&s;t of times, but ro&s;e &s;uperior to every misfortune, infu&s;ing new &s;pirit into the bo&s;oms of an unfortunate ar|my, and animating them by the force of example to un|dergo the &s;evere&s;t toil with alacrity, and to endure with per&s;everance the mo&s;t accumulated di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>It was the will of an Allwi&s;e Providence, that the great objects we were contending for &s;hould not be attain|ed without &s;ome difficulty, and that we &s;hould be taught to ob&s;erve and to value the virtues which &s;pring up in ad|ver&s;ity; but the time of our &s;evere trial was at length ter|minated&mdash;the cloud which had hovered over us &s;o long was at length di&s;pelled, and the &s;un of American glory ap|peared in its full &s;plendour. To have borne this change of fortune with equanimity, to have employed the la&s;t hours of command in reconciling our gallant &s;oldiers to a di&s;ap|pointment which their long &s;uffering during the war had but ill prepared them for; and having checked the rage of civil di&s;cord in its infancy, to have re&s;igned all power, and cheerfully de&s;cended into the walks of private life,&mdash; are circum&s;tances that mu&s;t forever illumine the page of hi&s;tory, and which, as they can never be effaced from our remembrance, &s;o we tru&s;t they will be deeply engraven upon the minds of our po&s;terity.</P>
<P>To tran&s;mit to that po&s;terity the &s;pirit of a free Con&s;ti|tution in its native purity is the hope which animates us all; we hope al&s;o, that they will learn from us to cheri&s;h every grateful &s;entiment towards you, Sir, and that they will be proud, as we are, to participate individually in the honour which America may &s;o ju&s;tly claim to her&s;elf, of having produced a citizen, who&s;e love of glory was de|void of ambition, who&s;e view embraced no objects but the freedom and the happine&s;s of his countrymen; who&s;e in|tegrity was equal to their mo&s;t unbounded confidence, and who, combining the prudence of retreat with all the active valor of attack, was at once the &s;hield and the &s;word of his native country. The tranquillity of retirement, after the dangers of war and the fatigues of public life, is one
<PB N="212" REF="031402_0107_0FEF92D9BA5190C0">
of tho&s;e rewards which exalted merit &s;eems ever entitled to, but which your fellow-citizens were con&s;trained to de|ny you. Independence had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, but the ar|duous ta&s;k of internal legi&s;lation &s;till remained, and the United States were yet to e&s;tabli&s;h upon the firme&s;t ba&s;is that &s;tation among&s;t the nations of the earth, which they had of right a&s;&s;umed. Called upon for this &s;acred purpo&s;e, you have li&s;tened, Sir, to the voice of your country&mdash;you have given a further proof of your never-failing attachment to her intere&s;ts; and we can only hope, in the warme&s;t wi&s;hes which we form for the good of the public weal, that your admini&s;tration in the office of Pre&s;ident of the United States may be as pro&s;perous as your acceptance of it has been honourable and patriotic.</P>
<P>We will not, Sir, by thus giving way to the effu&s;ions of our hearts, any longer intrude upon that time which is devoted to the general good, but conclude with offering up our prayers to the great Father of the Univer&s;e, that he may be plea&s;ed to &s;hed his influence over all your councils, and that having &s;aved your country and given an awful le&s;&s;on to all mankind, you may finally, in the fulne&s;s of your years, clo&s;e the long glories of an illu&s;trious life, not only with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having de&s;erved, but with the comfort and &s;atisfaction of having received every proof of re&s;pect and e&s;teem from the heart-felt gratitude of your fellow-citizens.</P>

<P>THE congratulatory Addre&s;s of the People of the State of South Carolina on my election to the office of Pre&s;ident of the United States, expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch forcible and endearing terms, affects me with the livelie&s;t emo|tions of &s;atisfaction, and induces me to reque&s;t their ac|ceptance of my &s;incere&s;t acknowledgments.</P>
<P>Flattering as it mu&s;t have been to me to find the extra|ordinary unanimity of the people of the United States, in placing me at the head of their federal republic, I am &s;till more plea&s;ed with the recollection of the manly conduct on their part, which, in the i&s;&s;ue of an arduous &s;truggle, put them in a condition to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of a free government. It was owing to their &s;teady and &s;trenuous &s;upport, with the &s;miles of a gracious Providence, that I did not &s;ink under the oppre&s;&s;ion I felt from a diffidence in my abilities to conduct their military operations. It was a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing con&s;ideration, that &s;o good a cau&s;e might be endangered by a &s;ingle fal&s;e &s;tep on the part of their General. But in &s;uch a cau&s;e, although &s;urrounded with difficulties and dangers on every &s;ide and in the mid&s;t of dark and gloomy pro&s;pects, it would have argued the mo&s;t infamous pu&s;illanimity to have de&s;paired of the common|wealth. Seconded by &s;uch a body of yeomanry as re|paired to the &s;tandard of liberty, fighting in their own na|tive land&mdash;fighting for all that freemen hold dear, and who&s;e docility &s;oon &s;upplied the place of di&s;cipline&mdash;it was &s;carcely in human nature, under its wor&s;t character, to have abandoned them in their misfortunes; nor is it for me to claim any &s;ingular title to merit, for having &s;hared in a common danger, and triumphed with them, after a &s;e|ries of the &s;evere&s;t toil and mo&s;t accumulated di&s;tre&s;s, over a formidable foe.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="031402_0108_0FEF92DE3425F5D8">The value of liberty was thus enhanced in our e&s;ti|mation by the difficulty of its attainment; and the worth of characters appreciated by the trial of adver&s;ity. The tempe&s;t of war having at length been &s;ucceeded by the &s;un&s;hine of peace, our citizen-&s;oldiers impre&s;&s;ed an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on of patrioti&s;m on mankind, by nobly returning, with impaired con&s;titutions and un&s;atisfied claims, after &s;uch long &s;ufferings and &s;evere di&s;appointments, to their former occupations. Po&s;terity, as well as the pre&s;ent age, will doubtle&s;s regard with admiration and gratitude the pa|tience, per&s;everance and valor which achieved our revo|lution; they will cheri&s;h the remembrance of virtues which had but few parallels in former times, and which will add new lu&s;tre to the mo&s;t &s;plendid page of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>If there be for me any peculiarly ju&s;t &s;ubject of exulta|tion, and with hone&s;t pride I avow the fact, it is in being the citizen of a country, who&s;e inhabitants were &s;o enlight|ened and di&s;intere&s;ted, as to &s;acrifice local prejudices and temporary &s;y&s;tems, for the &s;ake of rendering &s;ecure and per|manent that Independency, which had been the price of &s;o much trea&s;ure and blood. Animated with a hope of tran&s;mitting to po&s;terity the &s;pirit of a free Con&s;titution in its native purity, they have, &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the war, evinced the rectitude of their principles, as well as proved them&s;elves, by their practice, worthy of their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding my former intentions and declarations, I could not he&s;itate to return to public life, when, from all the circum&s;tances within my knowledge, I had collected it to be my duty, becau&s;e it was apparently the wi&s;h of a whole nation; nor &s;hall I regret the lo&s;s of that tranquillity in retirement, which my time of life and &s;tate of health &s;eemed in &s;ome mea&s;ure to authorize and re|quire, if I may &s;till be an in&s;trument of any good to that country, which has continued to a&s;&s;i&s;t my admini&s;tration with &s;uch generous and unlimited confidence.</P>
<P>I pray you to be per&s;uaded, that while I receive with great &s;en&s;ibility, &s;uch repeated proofs of the partiality of my fellow-citizens in my favour, I feel increa&s;ing obliga|tions to devote my labours unremittingly to the public &s;er|vice;

<P>PERMIT the children of the &s;tock of Abraham to ap|proach you with the mo&s;t cordial affection and e&s;teem for your per&s;on and merit, and to join with our fellow-citizens in welcoming you to Newport.</P>
<P>With plea&s;ure we reflect on tho&s;e days&mdash;tho&s;e days of difficulty and danger, when the God of I&s;rael, who deliv|ered David from the peril of the &s;word, &s;hielded your head

<P>Deprived as we heretofore have been of the invaluable rights of free citizens, we now (with a deep &s;en&s;e of grati|tude to the Almighty Di&s;po&s;er of all events) behold a gov|ernment erected by the Maje&s;ty of the People&mdash;a govern|ment, which to bigotry gives no &s;anction&mdash;to per&s;ecution no a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but generou&s;ly affording to all, liberty of con&s;cience, and immunities of citizen&s;hip: deeming every one, of whatever nation, tongue or language, equal parts of the great governmental machine. This &s;o ample and ex|ten&s;ive Federal Union, who&s;e ba&s;e is philanthropy, mutual confidence, and public virtue, we cannot but acknowledge to be the work of the Great God, who ruleth in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, doing what&s;oever &s;eemeth to him good.</P>

<P>WHILE I receive with much &s;atisfaction your Ad|dre&s;s, replete with expre&s;&s;ions of affection and e&s;teem, I rejoice in the opportunity of a&s;&s;uring you, that I &s;hall al|ways retain a grateful remembrance of the cordial welcome I experienced in my vi&s;it to Newport, from all cla&s;&s;es of citizens. The reflection on the days of difficulty and dan|ger which are pa&s;t, is rendered the more &s;weet from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that they are &s;ucceeded by days of uncommon pro&s;perity and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>If we have wi&s;dom to make the be&s;t u&s;e of the advan|tages with which we are now favoured, we cannot fail, under the ju&s;t admini&s;tration of a good government, to become a great and a happy people.</P>
<P>The citizens of the United States of America, have a right to applaud them&s;elves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy wor|thy of imitation. All po&s;&s;e&s;s a like liberty of con&s;cience, and immunities of citizen&s;hip. It is now no more that tol|eration is &s;poken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one cla&s;s of people that another enjoyed the exerci&s;e of their inherent natural rights. For happily the government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no &s;anction, to per&s;ecution no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, requires only that they who live under its protection &s;hould demean them&s;elves as good citi|zens, in giving it on all occa&s;ions their effectual &s;upport.</P>
<P>It would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the frankne&s;s of my char|acter, not to avow that I am plea&s;ed with your favourable opinion of my admini&s;tration and fervent wi&s;hes for my felicity. May the children of the &s;tock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants&mdash;while every one &s;hall &s;it in &s;afety under his own vine and fig-tree, and there &s;hall be none to make him afraid.</P>

<P>Nor have I departed from this line of conduct, on the occa&s;ion which has produced the Re&s;olutions contained in your letter of the 13th in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Without a predilection to my own judgment, I have weighed with attention every argument which has at any time been brought into view. But the Con&s;titution is the guide which I never can abandon. It has a&s;&s;igned to the Pre&s;ident the power of making treaties, with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate. It was doubtle&s;s &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e two branches of government would combine, without pa&s;&s;ion, and with the be&s;t means of information, tho&s;e facts and principles, upon which the &s;ucce&s;s of our foreign relations will always depend: that they ought not to &s;ub&s;titute for their own conviction, the opinions of oth|ers;

or to &s;eek truth through any channel but that of a temperate and well-informed inve&s;tigation.</P>

<P>I COME to acquit my&s;elf of a duty very dear to my heart. I come to depo&s;ite, in your hands and in the mid&s;t of a people ju&s;tly renowned for their courage, and their love of liberty, the &s;ymbol of the triumph and of the en|franchi&s;ement of my nation.</P>
<P>When &s;he broke her chains; when &s;he proclaimed the impre&s;criptable rights of man; when, in a terrible war, &s;he &s;ealed with her blood the covenant made with liberty,&mdash;her own happine&s;s was not alone the object of her glorious ef|forts; her views extended al&s;o to all free people; &s;he &s;aw their intere&s;ts blended with her own, and doubly re|joiced in her victories, which in a&s;&s;uring to her the enjoy|ments
<PB N="259" REF="031402_0130_0FEF931AD69FEA78">
of her rights, became to them new guarantees of their independence.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments, which animated the French nation, from the dawn of their revolution, have acquired new &s;trength &s;ince the foundation of the Republic. France, at that time, by the form of its government a&s;&s;imilated to, or rather indentified with free people, &s;aw in them only friends and brothers. Long accu&s;tomed to regard the American people as their mo&s;t faithful allies, &s;he has &s;ought to draw clo&s;er the ties already formed in the fields of America, under the au&s;pices of victory over the ruins of tyranny.</P>
<P>The National Convention, the organs of the will of the French nation, have more than once expre&s;&s;ed their &s;enti|ments to the American people; but above all, the&s;e bur&s;t forth on that augu&s;t day, when the mini&s;ters of the United States pre&s;ented to the National Repre&s;entation, the Colours of his country, de&s;iring never to lo&s;e recol|lections as dear to Frenchmen as they mu&s;t be to Amer|icans. The Convention ordered that the&s;e colours &s;hould be placed in the hall of their &s;ittings. They had expe|rienced &s;en&s;ations too agreeable not to cau&s;e them to be partaken of by their allies, and decreed that to them the National Colours &s;hould be pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Mr. Pre&s;ident, I do not doubt their expectations will be fulfilled; and I am convinced, that every citizen will receive, with a plea&s;ing emotion, this Flag, el&s;ewhere the terror of the enemies of liberty, here the certain pledge of faithful friend&s;hip; e&s;pecially when they recollect that it guides to combat, men who have &s;hared their toils, and who were prepared for liberty, by aiding them to acquire their own.</P>

<P>THE great object for which I had the honour to hold an appointment in the &s;ervice of my country, being accompli&s;hed, I am now preparing to re&s;ign it into the hands of Congre&s;s, and return to that do|me&s;tic retirement, which, it is well known, I left with the greate&s;t reluctance; a retirement for which I have never cea&s;ed to &s;igh through a long and painful ab&s;ence, in which (remote from the noi&s;e and trouble of the world) I meditate to pa&s;s the remainder of life in a &s;tate of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e: but, before I carry this re&s;olution into effect, I think it a duty incumbent on me to make this my la&s;t official communication, to congratulate you on the glorious events which Heaven has been plea&s;ed to produce in our favour, to offer my &s;entiments re&s;pecting &s;ome important &s;ubjects, which appear to me to be intimately connected with the tranquillity of the United States, to take my leave of your Excellency as a public character, and to give my final ble&s;&s;ing to that country in who&s;e &s;ervice I have &s;pent the prime of my life; for who&s;e &s;ake I have con&s;umed &s;o many anxious days and watchful nights; and who&s;e happine&s;s, being extremely dear to me, will always con&s;titute no incon&s;iderable part of my own.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the livelie&s;t &s;en&s;ibility on this plea&s;|ing occa&s;ion, I will claim the indulgence of dilating
<PB N="264" REF="031402_0133_0FEF9328A0645BC0">
the more copiou&s;ly on the &s;ubject of our mutual &s;e|licitation. When we con&s;ider the magnitude of the prize we contended for, the doubtful nature of the conte&s;t, and the favourable manner in which it has terminated; we &s;hall find the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on for gratitude and rejoicing: this is a theme that will afford infinite delight to every benevolent and liberal mind, whether the event in contemplation be con&s;id|ered as a &s;ource of pre&s;ent enjoyment, or the parent of future happine&s;s; and we &s;hall have equal occa&s;ion to felicitate our&s;elves on the lot which Providence has a&s;&s;igned us, whether we view it in a natural, a political, or moral point of view.</P>
<P>The citizens of America, placed in the mo&s;t envi|able condition, as the &s;ole lords and proprietors of a va&s;t tract of continent, comprehending all the various &s;oils and climates of the world, and abounding with all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life, are now, by the late &s;atisfactory pacification, acknowledged to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ab&s;olute freedom and independency; they are from this period to be con&s;idered as the ac|tors on a mo&s;t con&s;picuous theatre, which &s;eems to be peculiarly de&s;igned by Providence for the di&s;play of human greatne&s;s and felicity: here they are not only &s;urrounded with every thing that can contribute to the completion of private and dome&s;tic enjoyment, but Heaven has crowned all its other ble&s;&s;ings, by giving a &s;urer opportunity for political happine&s;s than any other nation has ever been favoured with. Nothing can illu&s;trate the&s;e ob&s;ervations more forcibly than the recollection of the happy conjuncture of times and circum&s;tances, under which our Republic a&s;&s;umed its rank among the nations. The foundation of our empire was not laid in a gloomy age of igno|rance and &s;uper&s;tition, but at an epocha when the rights of mankind were better under&s;tood and more clearly defined, than at any former period: re&s;earches of the human mind after &s;ocial happine&s;s have been carried to a great extent: the trea&s;ures of knowledge acquired by the labours of philo&s;ophers, &s;ages, and
<PB N="265" REF="031402_0133_0FEF9328A0645BC0">
legi&s;lators, through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, are laid open for u&s;e, and their collected wi&s;dom may be happily applied in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our forms of government: the free cultivation of letters, the un|bounded exten&s;ion of commerce, the progre&s;&s;ive re|finement of manners, the growing liberality of &s;enti|ment, and, above all, the pure and benign light of revelation, have had a meliorating influence on man|kind, and increa&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. At this au&s;picious period the United States came into exi&s;t|ence as a nation, and if their citizens &s;hould not be completely free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.</P>
<P>Such is our &s;ituation, and &s;uch are our pro&s;pects; but notwith&s;tanding the cup of ble&s;&s;ing is thus reach|ed out to us&mdash;notwith&s;tanding happine&s;s is ours, if we have a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eize the occa&s;ion, and make it our own; yet it appears to me, there is an option &s;till left to the United States of America, whether they will be re&s;pectable and pro&s;perous, or contemptible and mi&s;erable as a nation. This is the time of their political probation; this is the moment, when the eyes of the whole world are turned upon them; this is the time to e&s;tabli&s;h or ruin their national character forever; this is the favourable moment to give &s;uch a tone to the Federal Government, as will enable it to an&s;wer the ends of its in&s;titution; or this may be the ill-fated moment for relaxing the powers of the Union, annihilating the cement of the Confederation, and ex|po&s;ing us to become the &s;port of European politics, which may play one State again&s;t another, to prevent their growing importance, and to &s;erve their own in|tere&s;ted purpo&s;es. For, according to the &s;y&s;tem of policy the States &s;hall adopt at this moment, they will &s;tand or fall; and, by their confirmation or lap&s;e, it is yet to be decided, whether the revolution mu&s;t ulti|mately be con&s;idered as a ble&s;&s;ing or a cur&s;e; a ble&s;&s;|ing or a cur&s;e, not to the pre&s;ent age alone, for with our fate will the de&s;tiny of unborn millions be in|volved.</P>

<P>The&s;e are the pillars on which the glorious fabric of our independency and national character mu&s;t be &s;upported. Liberty is the ba&s;is, and whoever would dare to &s;ap the foundation, or overturn the &s;tructure,

under whatever &s;pecious pretext he may attempt it, will merit the bittere&s;t execration and the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment which can be inflicted by his injured country.</P>
<P>On the three fir&s;t articles I will make a few ob&s;erva|tions, leaving the la&s;t to the good &s;en&s;e and &s;erious con&s;ideration of tho&s;e immediately concerned.</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t head, although it may not be nece&s;|&s;ary or proper for me in this place to enter into a particular di&s;qui&s;ition of the principles of the Union, and to take up the great que&s;tion which has been fre|quently agitated, whether it be expedient and requi|&s;ite for the States to delegate a large proportion of power to Congre&s;s, or not; yet it will be a part of my duty, and that of every true patriot, to a&s;&s;ert, without re&s;erve, and to in&s;i&s;t upon the following po&s;itions. That unle&s;s the States will &s;uffer Congre&s;s to exerci&s;e tho&s;e prerogatives they are undoubtedly inve&s;ted with by the con&s;titution, every thing mu&s;t very rapidly tend to anarchy and confu&s;ion.&mdash;That it is indi&s;pen&s;able to the happine&s;s of the individual States, that there &s;hould be lodged, &s;omewhere, a &s;upreme power, to regulate and govern the general concerns of the confederated republic, without which the Union cannot be of long du|ration.&mdash;That there mu&s;t be a faithful and pointed com|pliance on the part of every State with the late propo|&s;als and demands of Congre&s;s, or the mo&s;t fatal con&s;e|quences will en&s;ue.&mdash;That whatever mea&s;ures have a tendency to di&s;&s;olve the union, or contribute to violate or le&s;&s;en the &s;overeign authority, ought to be con&s;ider|ed as ho&s;tile to the liberty and independency of Ameri|ca, and the authors of them treated accordingly.&mdash;And la&s;tly, that unle&s;s we can be enabled by the concur|rence of the States to participate of the fruits of the revolution, and enjoy the e&s;&s;ential benefits of civil &s;o|ciety, under a form of government &s;o free and uncor|rupted, &s;o happily guarded again&s;t the danger of op|pre&s;&s;ion, as has been devi&s;ed and adopted by the ar|ticles of confederation, it will be a &s;ubject of regret,
<PB N="268" REF="031402_0135_0FEF932E32565658">
that &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure have been lavi&s;hed for no purpo&s;e; that &s;o many &s;ufferings have been encountered without a compen&s;ation, and that &s;o ma|ny &s;acrifices have been made in vain. Many other con&s;iderations might here be adduced to prove, that without an entire conformity to the &s;pirit of the Union, we cannot exi&s;t as an independent power. It will be &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e to mention but one or two, which &s;eem to me of the greate&s;t importance. It is only in our united character, as an empire, that our independence is acknowledged, that our power can be regarded, or our credit &s;upported among foreign na|tions. The treaties of the European powers with the United States of America, will have no validity on the di&s;&s;olution of the Union. We &s;hall be left nearly in a &s;tate of nature; or we may find, by our own unhappy experience, that there is a natural and nece&s;&s;ary pro|gre&s;&s;ion from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of tyranny; and that arbitrary power is mo&s;t ea&s;ily e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ruins of liberty abu&s;ed to licentiou&s;|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd article, which re&s;pects the perform|ance of public ju&s;tice, Congre&s;s have, in their late Addre&s;s to the United States, almo&s;t exhau&s;ted the &s;ubject; they have explained their ideas &s;o fully, and have enforced the obligations the States are under to render complete ju&s;tice to all the public creditors, with &s;o much dignity and energy, that in my opinion, no real friend to the honour and independency of Amer|ica can he&s;itate a &s;ingle moment re&s;pecting the pro|priety of complying with the ju&s;t and honourable mea&s;ures propo&s;ed. If their arguments do not produce conviction, I know of nothing that will have greater influence, e&s;pecially when we reflect that the &s;y&s;tem referred to, being the re&s;ult of the collected wi&s;dom of the continent, mu&s;t be e&s;teemed, if not perfect, cer|tainly the lea&s;t objectionable of any that could be devi&s;ed; and that, if it &s;hould not be carried into immediate execution, a national bankruptcy, with all
<PB N="269" REF="031402_0135_0FEF932E32565658">
its deplorable con&s;equences, will take place, before any different plan can po&s;&s;ibly be propo&s;ed or adopted; &s;o pre&s;&s;ing are the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and &s;uch is the alternative now offered to the States.</P>
<P>The ability of the country to di&s;charge the debts which have been incurred in its defence, is not to be doubted. An inclination, I flatter my&s;elf, will not be wanting; the path of our duty is plain before us; hone&s;ty will be found, on every experiment, to be the be&s;t and only true policy. Let us then, as a nation, be ju&s;t; let us fulfil the public contracts which Con|gre&s;s had undoubtedly a right to make for the pur|po&s;e of carrying on the war, with the &s;ame good faith we &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves bound to perform our private en|gagements. In the mean time let an attention to the cheerful performance of their proper bu&s;ine&s;s, as in|dividuals, and as members of &s;ociety, be earne&s;tly in|culcated on the citizens of America; then will they &s;trengthen the bands of government, and be happy under its protection. Every one will reap the fruit of his labours; every one will enjoy his own acqui&s;i|tions, without mole&s;tation and without danger.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of ab&s;olute freedom and perfect &s;ecuri|ty, who will grudge to yield a very little of his prop|erty to &s;upport the common intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and en&s;ure the protection of government? Who does not remember the frequent declarations at the commence|ment of the war, that we &s;hould be completely &s;atisfi|ed, if at the expen&s;e of one half, we could defend the remainder of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions? Where is the man to be found, who wi&s;hes to remain indebted for the defence of his own per&s;on and property to the exertions, the bravery, and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to pay the debt of honour and of grati|tude? In what part of the continent &s;hall we find any man, or body of men, who would not blu&s;h to &s;tand up, and propo&s;e mea&s;ures purpo&s;ely calculated to rob the &s;oldier of his &s;tipend, and the public creditor of his due? And were it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a flagrant in&s;tance of inju&s;tice could ever happen, would it not excite the
<PB N="270" REF="031402_0136_0FEF8ED7D83BD798">
general indignation, and tend to bring down, upon the authors of &s;uch mea&s;ures, the aggravated ven|geance of Heaven? If, after all, a &s;pirit of di&s;union, or a temper of ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s &s;hould manife&s;t it&s;elf in any of the States; if &s;uch an ungracious di&s;po|&s;ition &s;hould attempt to fru&s;trate all the happy effects that might be expected to flow from the Union; if there &s;hould be a refu&s;al to comply with the requi&s;i|tions for funds to di&s;charge the annual intere&s;t of the public debts, and if that refu&s;al &s;hould revive all tho&s;e jealou&s;ies, and produce all tho&s;e evils which are now happily removed&mdash;Congre&s;s, who have in all their tran&s;|actions &s;hewn a great degree of magnanimity and ju&s;|tice, will &s;tand ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God and man! And that State alone, which puts it&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to the aggregate wi&s;dom of the continent, and follows &s;uch mi&s;taken and pernicious councils, will be re&s;pon|&s;ible for all the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>For my own part, con&s;cious of having acted while a &s;ervant of the public, in the manner I conceived be&s;t &s;uited to promote the real intere&s;ts of my country; having, in con&s;equence of my fixed belief, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, pledged my&s;elf to the army, that their coun|try would finally do them complete and ample ju&s;tice, and not willing to conceal any in&s;tance of my official conduct from the eyes of the world, I have thought proper to tran&s;mit to your Excellency the inclo&s;ed collection of papers, relative to the half-pay and com|mutation granted by Congre&s;s to the officers of the army: from the&s;e communications, my decided &s;en|timent will be clearly comprehended, together with the conclu&s;ive rea&s;ons, which induced me at an early period, to recommend the adoption of this mea&s;ure in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and &s;erious manner. As the pro|ceedings of Congre&s;s, the army, and my&s;elf, are open to all, and contain, in my opinion, &s;ufficient informa|tion to remove the prejudice and errors which may have been entertained by any, I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing more, than ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, now alluded to, are as un|doubtedly
<PB N="271" REF="031402_0136_0FEF8ED7D83BD798">
and ab&s;olutely binding upon the United States, as the mo&s;t &s;olemn acts of confederation or legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>As to the idea, which I am informed, has in &s;ome in&s;tances prevailed, that the half-pay and commuta|tion are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a pen&s;ion, it ought to be exploded forever: that pro|vi&s;ion &s;hould be viewed, as it really was, a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation offered by Congre&s;s, at a time when they had nothing el&s;e to give to officers of the army, for &s;ervices then to be performed: it was the only means to prevent a total derilection of the &s;ervice; it was a part of their hire. I may be allowed to &s;ay, it was the price of their blood, and of your independ|ency; it is therefore more than a common debt, it is a debt of honour; it can never be con&s;idered as a pen&s;ion or gratuity, nor cancelled until it is fairly di&s;|charged.</P>
<P>With regard to the di&s;tinction between officers and &s;oldiers, it is &s;ufficient that the uniform experience of every nation of the world, combined with our own, proves the utility and propriety of the di&s;crimination. Rewards, in proportion to the aid the public draws from them, are unque&s;tionably due to all its &s;ervants. In &s;ome lines, the &s;oldiers have perhaps generally had as ample compen&s;ation for their &s;ervices, by the large bounties which have been paid them, as their officers will receive in the propo&s;ed commutation; in others, if be&s;ides the donation of land, the payment of arrear|ages of cloathing and wages (in which articles all the component parts of the army mu&s;t be put upon the &s;ame footing) we take into the e&s;timate, the bounties many of the &s;oldiers have received, and the gratuity of one year's full pay, which is promi&s;ed to all, po&s;|&s;ibly their &s;ituation (every circum&s;tance being duly con&s;idered) will not be deemed le&s;s eligible than that of the officers. Should a farther reward, however, be judged equitable, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, no man will enjoy greater &s;atisfaction than my&s;elf, in an exemp|tion from taxes for a limited time (which has been
<PB N="272" REF="031402_0137_0FEF933650AD39E0">
petitioned for in &s;ome in&s;tances) or any other adequate immunity or compen&s;ation granted to the brave de|fenders of their country's cau&s;e: but neither the adop|tion or rejection of this propo&s;ition will, in any man|ner affect, much le&s;s militate again&s;t the act of Con|gre&s;s, by which they have offered five years full pay, in lieu of the half-pay for life, which had been before promi&s;ed to the officers of the army.</P>
<P>Before I conclude the &s;ubject on public ju&s;tice, I can|not omit to mention the obligations this country is un|der to that meritorious cla&s;s of veterans, the non|commi&s;&s;ioned officers and privates, who have been di&s;|charged for inability, in con&s;equence of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, of the 23d of April, 1782, on an annual pen&s;ion for life. Their peculiar &s;ufferings, their &s;ingu|lar merits and claims to that provi&s;ion need only to be known, to intere&s;t the feelings of humanity in their be|half. Nothing but a punctual payment of their annual allowance can re&s;cue them from the mo&s;t complicated mi&s;ery; and nothing could be a more melancholy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ight, than to behold tho&s;e who have &s;hed their blood, or lo&s;t their limbs in the &s;ervice of their country, without a &s;helter, without a friend, and with|out the means of obtaining any of the comforts or nece&s;&s;aries of life, compelled to beg their daily bread from door to door. Suffer me to recommend tho&s;e of this de&s;cription, belonging to your State, to the warme&s;t patronage of your Excellency and your Legi&s;|lature.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay but a few words on the third topic which was propo&s;ed, and which regards particu|larly the defence of the republic. As there can be lit|tle doubt but Congre&s;s will recommend a proper peace e&s;tabli&s;hment for the United States, in which a due at|tention will be paid to the importance of placing the militia of the Union upon a regular and re&s;pectable footing; if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I &s;hould beg leave to urge the great advantage of it in the &s;tronge&s;t terms.</P>
<P>The militia of this country mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the palladium of our &s;ecurity, and the fir&s;t effectual re|&s;ort
<PB N="273" REF="031402_0137_0FEF933650AD39E0">
in ca&s;e of ho&s;tility: it is e&s;&s;ential, therefore, that the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem &s;hould pervade the whole that the formation and di&s;cipline of the militia of the continent &s;hould be ab&s;olutely uniform; and that the &s;ame &s;pe|cies of arms, accoutrements, and military apparatus, &s;hould be introduced in every part of the United States. No one, who has not learned it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, expen&s;e, and confu&s;ion which re&s;ult from a contrary &s;y&s;tem, or the vague arrange|ments which have hitherto prevailed.</P>
<P>If, in treating of political points, a greater latitude than u&s;ual has been taken in the cour&s;e of the Addre&s;s, the importance of the cri&s;is, and the magnitude of the objects in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be my apology: it is, how|ever, neither my wi&s;h nor expectation, that the prece|ding ob&s;ervations &s;hould claim any regard, except &s;o far as they &s;hall appear to be dictated by a good inten|tion; con&s;onant to the immutable rules of ju&s;tice; cal|culated to produce a liberal &s;y&s;tem of policy, and found|ed on whatever experience may have been acquired by a long and clo&s;e attention to public bu&s;ine&s;s. Here I might &s;peak with more confidence, from my actual ob&s;ervations; and if it would not &s;well this letter (al|ready too prolix) beyond the bounds I had pre&s;cribed my&s;elf, I could demon&s;trate to every mind, open to conviction, that in le&s;s time, and with much le&s;s ex|pen&s;e than has been incurred, the war might have been brought to the &s;ame happy conclu&s;ion, if the re|&s;ources of the continent could have been properly call|ed forth; that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments which have very often occurred, have, in too many in&s;tances, re&s;ulted more from a want of energy in the continental government, than a deficiency of means in the particu|lar States: that the inefficacy of the mea&s;ures, ari&s;ing from the want of an adequate authority in the &s;upreme power, from a partial compliance with the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s in &s;ome of the States, and from a failure of punctuality in others, while they tended to damp the zeal of tho&s;e who were more willing to exert them|&s;elves, &s;erved al&s;o to accumulate the expen&s;es of the
<PB N="274" REF="031402_0138_0FEF9337ED3AD798">
war, and to fru&s;trate the be&s;t concerted plans; and that the di&s;couragement occa&s;ioned by the complicated difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments, in which our affairs were by this means involved, would have long age produced the di&s;&s;olution of any army, le&s;s patient, le&s;s virtuous, and le&s;s per&s;evering than that which I have had the honour to command. But while I mention tho&s;e things, which are notorious facts, as the defects of our Federal Con&s;titution, particularly in the pro&s;e|cution of a war, I beg it may be under&s;tood, that as I have ever taken a plea&s;ure in gratefully acknowledg|ing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport I have derived from every cla&s;s of citizens; &s;o &s;hall I always be happy to do ju&s;tice to the unparalleled exertions of the individ|ual States, on many intere&s;ting occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I have thus freely di&s;clo&s;ed what I wi&s;hed to make known before I &s;urrendered up my public tru&s;t to tho&s;e who committed it to me: the ta&s;k is now ac|compli&s;hed. I now bid adieu to your Excellency, as the Chief Magi&s;trate of your State; at the &s;ame time I bid a la&s;t farewell to the cares of office, and all the em|ployments of public life.</P>
<P>It remains, then, to be my final and only reque&s;t, that your Excellency will communicate the&s;e &s;entiments to your legi&s;lature, at their next meeting; and that they may be con&s;idered as the legacy of one who has ardently wi&s;hed, on all occa&s;ions, to be u&s;eful to his country, and who, even in the &s;hade of retirement, will not fail to implore the divine benediction upon it.</P>
<P>I now make it my earne&s;t prayer, that God would have you, and the State over which you pre&s;ide, in his holy protection; that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a &s;pirit of &s;ubordination and obedience to government; to entertain a brotherly af|fection and love for one another, for their fellow-citi|zens of the United States at large; and particularly for their brethren who have &s;erved in the field; and finally, that he would mo&s;t graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed to di&s;|po&s;e us all to do ju&s;tice, to love mercy, and to demean our&s;elves with that charity, humility, and pacific tem|per

of the mind, which were the characteri&s;tics of the divine Author of our ble&s;&s;ed religion; without an humble imitation of who&s;e example, in the&s;e things, we can never hope to be a happy nation.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Rocky Hill, near Princeton,
<DATE>November 2, 1783.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, after giving the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timony to the merits of the federal armies, and pre&s;enting them with the thanks of their country, for their long, eminent and faithful &s;ervice, having thought proper, by their proclamation bearing date the 18th of October la&s;t, to di&s;charge &s;uch part of the troops as were engaged for the war, and to permit the officers on furlough to retire from &s;ervice, from and after to-morrow, which proclamation having been communicated in the public papers for the infor|mation and government of all concerned; it only re|mains for the Commander in Chief to addre&s;s him&s;elf once more, and that for the la&s;t time, to the armies of the United States, (however widely di&s;per&s;ed individu|als who compo&s;e them may be) and to bid them an affectionate, a long farewell.</P>
<P>But before the Commander in Chief takes his final leave of tho&s;e he holds mo&s;t dear, he wi&s;hes to indulge him&s;elf a few moments in calling to mind a &s;light re|view of the pa&s;t:&mdash;he will then take the liberty of ex|ploring,
<PB N="276" REF="031402_0139_0FEF93398543E298">
with his military friends, their future pro&s;|pects; of advi&s;ing the general line of conduct which in his opinion ought to be pur&s;ued; and he will conclude the Addre&s;s, by expre&s;&s;ing the obligations he feels him|&s;elf under for the &s;pirited and able a&s;&s;i&s;tance he has experienced from them, in the performance of an ar|duous office.</P>
<P>A contemplation of the complete attainment (at a period earlier than could have been expected) of the object for which we contended again&s;t &s;o formidable a power, cannot but in&s;pire us with a&s;toni&s;hment and gratitude. The di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances on our part, under which the war was undertaken, can never be forgotten. The &s;ingular interpo&s;itions of Provi|dence in our feeble condition, were &s;uch as could &s;carce|ly e&s;cape the attention of the mo&s;t unob&s;erving&mdash;while the unparalleled per&s;everance of the armies of the Uni|ted States, through almo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible &s;uffering and di&s;couragement, for the &s;pace of eight long years, was little &s;hort of a &s;tanding miracle.</P>
<P>It is not the meaning, nor within the compa&s;s of this Addre&s;s, to detail the hard&s;hips peculiarly inci|dent to our &s;ervice, or to de&s;cribe the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which in &s;everal in&s;tances have re&s;ulted from the extremes of hunger and nakedne&s;s, combined with the rigours of an inclement &s;ea&s;on; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to dwell on the dark &s;ide of our pa&s;t affairs. Every American officer and &s;oldier mu&s;t now con&s;ole him&s;elf for any unplea&s;ant circum&s;tances which may have occurred, by a recollection of the uncommon &s;cenes in which he has been called to act no inglorious part, and the a&s;ton|i&s;hing events of which he has been a witne&s;s; events which have &s;eldom, if ever before, taken place on the &s;tage of human action, nor can they probably ever hap|pen again. For who has before &s;een a di&s;ciplined ar|my formed at once from &s;uch raw materials? Who that was not a witne&s;s could imagine that the mo&s;t vi|olent local prejudices would cea&s;e &s;o &s;oon, and that men who came from the different parts of the conti|nent, &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed by the habits of education to
<PB N="277" REF="031402_0139_0FEF93398543E298">
de&s;pi&s;e and quarrel with each other, would in&s;tantly become but one patriotic band of brothers? Or who that was not on the &s;pot, can trace the &s;teps by which &s;uch a wonderful revolution has been effected, and &s;uch a glorious period put to all our warlike toils?</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally acknowledged, that the enlarged pro&s;pects of happine&s;s, opened by the confirmation of our independence and &s;overeignty, almo&s;t exceed the power of de&s;cription: and &s;hall not the brave men who have contributed &s;o e&s;&s;entially to the&s;e ine&s;timable acqui&s;itions, retiring victorious from the field of war to the field of agriculture, participate in all the ble&s;|&s;ings which have been obtained? In &s;uch a republic, who will exclude them from the rights of citizens, and the fruits of their labours? In &s;uch a country, &s;o happily circum&s;tanced, the pur&s;uits of commerce, and the cultivation of the &s;oil, will unfold to indu&s;try the certain road to competence. To tho&s;e hardy &s;oldiers who are actuated by the &s;pirit of adventure, the fi&s;he|ries will afford ample and profitable employment: and the exten&s;ive and fertile regions of the We&s;t will yield a mo&s;t happy a&s;ylum to tho&s;e who, fond of dome&s;tic enjoyment, are &s;eeking per&s;onal independence. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive that any one of the United States will prefer a national bankruptcy, and the di&s;|&s;olution of the Union, to a compliance with the requi|&s;itions of Congre&s;s, and the payment of its ju&s;t debts; &s;o that the officers and &s;oldiers may expect con&s;idera|ble a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in re-commencing their civil occupations, from the &s;ums due to them from the public, which mu&s;t and will mo&s;t inevitably be paid.</P>
<P>In order to effect this de&s;irable purpo&s;e, and to remove the prejudices which may have taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the minds of any of the good people of the States, it is earne&s;tly recommended to all the troops, that, with &s;trong attachments to the Union, they &s;hould carry with them into civil &s;ociety the mo&s;t conciliating di&s;po&s;itions; and that they &s;hould prove them&s;elves not le&s;s virtuous and u&s;eful as citizens, than they have

been per&s;evering and victorious as &s;oldiers. What though there &s;hould be &s;ome envious individuals, who are unwilling to pay the debt the public has con|tracted, or to yield the tribute due to merit; yet let &s;uch unworthy treatment produce no invective, or any in&s;tance of intemperate conduct; let it be remembered, that the unbia&s;&s;ed voice of the free citizens of the Uni|ted States has promi&s;ed the ju&s;t reward, and given the merited applau&s;e; let it be known and remembered, that the reputation of the federal armies is e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond the reach of malevolence; and let a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of their achievements, and fame, &s;till excite the men who compo&s;ed them to honourable actions, under the per&s;ua&s;ion, that the private virtues of economy, prudence, and indu&s;try, will not be le&s;s amiable in civil life, than the more &s;plendid qualities of valor, per&s;everance, and enterprize were in the field. Every one may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that much, very much of the fu|ture happine&s;s of the officers and men will depend up|on the wi&s;e and manly conduct which &s;hall be adopted by them, when they are mingled with the great body of the community. And although the General has &s;o frequently given it as his opinion, in the mo&s;t pub|lic and explicit manner, that unle&s;s the principles of the Federal Government were properly &s;upported, and the powers of the Union increa&s;ed, the honour, dignity, and ju&s;tice of the nation, would be lo&s;t for|ever; yet he cannot help repeating on this occa&s;ion &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;entiment, and leaving it as his la&s;t in|junction to every officer and every &s;oldier who may view the &s;ubject in the &s;ame &s;erious point of light, to add his be&s;t endeavours to tho&s;e of his worthy fellow-citizens, towards effecting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e great and valuable pur|po&s;es, on which our very exi&s;tence as a nation &s;o ma|terially depends.</P>

not only the army under his immediate com|mand, but the different detachments and &s;eparate ar|mies, through the cour&s;e of the war. From their good &s;en&s;e and prudence he anticipated the happie&s;t con&s;e|quences: and while he congratulates them on the glo|rious occa&s;ion which renders their &s;ervices in the field no longer nece&s;&s;ary, he wi&s;hes to expre&s;s the &s;trong ob|ligations he feels him&s;elf under for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he has received from every cla&s;s, and in every in&s;tance. He pre|&s;ents his thanks, in the mo&s;t &s;erious and affectionate man|ner, to the general officers, as well for their coun&s;el on many intere&s;ting occa&s;ions, as for their ardour in pro|moting the &s;ucce&s;s of the plans he had adopted; to the commandants of regiments and corps, and to the offi|cers for their zeal and attention in carrying his orders promptly into execution; to the &s;taff, for their alacri|ty and exactne&s;s in performing the duties of their &s;ev|eral departments; and to the non-commi&s;&s;ioned offi|cers and private &s;oldiers, for their extraordinary pa|tience in &s;uffering, as well as their invincible fortitude in action. To various branches of the army the Gen|eral takes this la&s;t and &s;olemn opportunity of profe&s;|&s;ing his inviolable attachment and friend&s;hip: He wi&s;hes more than bare profe&s;&s;ions were in his power, that he was really able to be u&s;eful to them all in fu|ture life.

<HEAD>The An&s;wer. To his Excellency <HI>GENERAL WASHINGTON,</HI> Com|mander in Chief of the <HI>ARMIES</HI> of the <HI>UNITED STATES</HI> of <HI>AMERICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE, the officers of the part of the army remain|ing on the banks of the Hud&s;on, have received your Excellency's &s;erious and farewell Addre&s;s to the armies of the United States. We beg you to accept our un|feigned thanks for the communication, and your affec|tionate a&s;&s;urances of inviolable attachment and friend|&s;hip. If your attempts to en&s;ure to the armies the ju&s;t, the promi&s;ed rewards, of their long, &s;evere, and dan|gerous &s;ervices, have failed of &s;ucce&s;s, we believe it has ari&s;en from cau&s;es not in your Excellency's power to control. With extreme regret do we reflect on the occa&s;ion which called for &s;uch endeavours. But while we thank your Excellency for the&s;e exertions in favour of the troops you have &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully commanded, we pray it may be believed, that in this &s;entiment our own particular intere&s;ts have but a &s;econdary place; and that even the ultimate ingratitude of the people (were that po&s;&s;ible) could not &s;hake the patrioti&s;m of tho&s;e who &s;uffer by it. Still with plea&s;ing wonder and with grateful joy &s;hall we contemplate the glorious conclu|&s;ion of our labours. To that merit in the revolution which, under the au&s;pices of Heaven, the armies have di&s;played, po&s;terity will do ju&s;tice; and the &s;ons will blu&s;h who&s;e fathers were their foes.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="031402_0141_0FEF93439D8311A8">Mo&s;t gladly would we ca&s;t a veil on every act which fullies the reputation of our country&mdash;never &s;hould the page of hi&s;tory be &s;tained with its di&s;honour&mdash;even from our memories &s;hould the idea be era&s;ed. We lament the oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e &s;alutary mea&s;ures which the wi&s;dom of the Union has planted; mea&s;ures which alone can recover and fix on a permanent ba&s;is the credit of the States; mea&s;ures which are e&s;&s;ential to the ju&s;tice, the honour, and intere&s;t of the nation. While &s;he was giving the noble&s;t proofs of magnanim|ity, with con&s;cious pride we &s;aw her growing fame; and, regardle&s;s of pre&s;ent &s;ufferings, we looked forward to the end of our toils and dangers, to brighter &s;cenes in pro&s;pect. There we beheld the genius of our coun|try dignified by &s;overeignty and independence, &s;up|ported by ju&s;tice, and adorned with every liberal vir|tue. There we &s;aw patient Hu&s;bandry fearle&s;s extend her cultured fields, and animated Commerce &s;pread her &s;ails to every wind. There we beheld fair Science lift her head, with all the Arts attending in her train. There, ble&s;t with freedom, we &s;aw the human mind ex|pand; and, throwing a&s;ide the re&s;traints which con|fined it to the narrow bounds of country, it embraced the world. Such were our fond hopes, and with &s;uch delightful pro&s;pects did they pre&s;ent us. Nor are we di&s;appointed. Tho&s;e animating pro&s;pects are now changed and changing to realities; and actively to have contributed to their production is our pride, our glory. But ju&s;tice alone can give them &s;tability. In that ju&s;tice we &s;till believe. Still we hope that the prej|udices of the mi&s;informed will be removed, and the arts of fal&s;e and &s;elfi&s;h popularity, addre&s;&s;ed to the feelings of avarice, defeated: or, in the wor&s;t event, the world, we hope, will make the ju&s;t di&s;tinction: we tru&s;t the di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of a few will not &s;ully the reputa|tion, the honour, and dignity, of the great and re&s;pec|table majority of the States.</P>
<P>We are happy in the opportunity ju&s;t pre&s;ented of congratulating your Excellency on the certain conclu|&s;ion of the definitive treaty of peace. Relieved at length

from long &s;u&s;pen&s;e, our warme&s;t wi&s;h is to return to the bo&s;om of our country, to re&s;ume the character of citizens; and it will be our highe&s;t ambition to become u&s;eful ones. To your Excellency this great event mu&s;t be peculiarly plea&s;ing: for while at the head of her armies, urged by patriot virtues and magnanimity, you per&s;evered, under the pre&s;&s;ure of every po&s;&s;ible difficul|ty and di&s;couragement, in the pur&s;uit of the great ob|jects of the war&mdash;the freedom and &s;afety of your coun|try;&mdash;your heart panted for the tranquil enjoyments of peace. We cordially rejoice with you that the pe|riod of indulging them has arrived &s;o &s;oon. In con|templating the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty and independence, the rich prize of eight years hardy adventure, pa&s;t &s;uf|ferings will be forgotten; or if remembered, the rec|collection will &s;erve to heighten the reli&s;h of pre&s;ent happine&s;s. We &s;incerely pray God this happine&s;s may long be your's; and that when you quit the &s;tage of human life, you may receive from the unerring Judge, the rewards of valor exerted to &s;ave the oppre&s;&s;ed, of patrioti&s;m, and di&s;intere&s;ted virtue.</P>
