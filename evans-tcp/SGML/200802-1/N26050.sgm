<P>SOLOMON wi&s;ely decided the comparative merit of characters. Viewing through an im|partial medium their motives, plans of conduct, and re&s;pective influence on the public manners and happine&s;s, "he weighed them in an even bal|ance," and &s;uffered intrin&s;ic excellence only to preponderate.</P>
<P>The contra&s;ts, exhibited in the text, bring to view a re&s;pectable proportion of every community. Either impetuo&s;ity or moderation, ra&s;hne&s;s or cour|age, pu&s;illanimity or fortitude, contentracnt or am|bition, genero&s;ity or avarice are leading features in the character of the principal members. The&s;e virtues or vices, according to their natural tenden|cy,
<PB N="6" REF="034648_0004_0FFF45F092FA94E0">
lead to the elevation or deba&s;ement of per&s;onal virtue, and to the promotion or de&s;truction of na|tional honor and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Men, who lu&s;t after power, and are ambitious of exten&s;ive dominion, are ju&s;tly characteri&s;ed par|tial in reflection, ha&s;ty in re&s;entment, precipitate in deci&s;ion, and in&s;tead of acting on the broad &s;cale of virtue or of public utility, &s;olely aim after per|&s;onal aggrandizement. Blindly pur&s;uing their mad &s;chemes, they forget, that an equitable exerci&s;e of power is the offspring of a well regulated heart, and that to check the turbulency of pa&s;&s;ion, is the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tant in effecting honorable conque&s;ts. Stran|gers to con&s;i&s;tency, deaf to the voice of con&s;cience, and enemies to rea&s;on, they impetuou&s;ly pre&s;s for|ward to the accompli&s;hment of a favorite object, and rely for the pure&s;t felicity on the &s;ubjugation of millions to their de&s;potic &s;way.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a perfect control and delib|erate indulgence of pa&s;&s;ion lead to ju&s;tne&s;s and ex|tent of thought, coolne&s;s of deci&s;ion, and a proper e&s;timate of the views, purpo&s;es and provocations of individuals and of communities. The man, who is &s;low to anger, &s;uffers no ill founded preju|dice, &s;uper&s;icial examination, ha&s;ty opinion or wild re&s;olution to direct his conduct. But relying on the deliberate conclu&s;ions of unbia&s;&s;ed rea&s;on, his chief employment is the di&s;covery of what is right and fit, and the public benefit is the grand object of his pur&s;uit. The&s;e attainments are evidently the re&s;ult of laudable proficiency in &s;elf-govern|ment. When oppo&s;ed to the petulant, to unprin|cipled

&s;eekers after power, or to &s;uch as are de&s;ir|ous of laying a foundation for univer&s;al empire, this de&s;cription of characters is entitled to high ap|plau&s;e. In their practice is implied a re&s;pect for the dictates of rea&s;on and the precepts of the go&s;|pel, a commendable &s;olicitude for the harmony and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, and an active purpo&s;e to extend the knowledge and to promote the princi|ples of the divine government.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations already made, exhibit the out|lines of the characters of tho&s;e members of &s;ociety, who give unbounded licen&s;e to pa&s;&s;ion, and of &s;uch as re&s;train it within rea&s;onable limits. To di&s;|play more explicitly the properties of per&s;onal di&s;|cipline, as oppo&s;ed to an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for power or exten&s;ive conque&s;t; to deduce a preference in favor of the former, from the good effects it tends to produce; to confirm our remarks by hi&s;|torical examples; and to offer &s;ome reflections &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the &s;ituation and pro&s;pects of our coun|try, form the de&s;ign of the en&s;uing part of the di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The general characteri&s;tic of per&s;onal di&s;cipline is the honorable &s;upremacy it pre&s;erves over pa&s;|&s;ion, and the &s;ub&s;erviency it extorts from it, to the elevated de&s;ires, purpo&s;es and pur&s;uits of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>No conflict is ever more dangerous, violent or eventful, than this, maintained between the&s;e two e&s;&s;ential and important parts of every human character. It is dangerous, becau&s;e rea&s;on is likely to be wounded and overcome in the conte&s;t. It is violent, becau&s;e the "ca&s;ting of fire-brands, ar|rows
<PB N="8" REF="034648_0006_0FFF45F3E31961D0">
and death" is the natural product of exce&s;&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion. It is eventful, becau&s;e there is no empire &s;o de&s;potic, no tyranny &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive, no victory &s;o haughty and in&s;olent, as that which is &s;upported or gained by pa&s;&s;ion. A ri&s;ing &s;uperior to this danger, a &s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition to this violence, and an entire defeat of the hope of obtaining a victory can only be effected by the man who habitually "ruleth his own &s;pirit."</P>
<P>A criminal error in the ambitious, in men a&s;piring after power, who&s;e wi&s;hes are &s;carcely limited by the univer&s;e, and who cheri&s;h the intention to con|quer and oppre&s;s it's inhabitants, is that they neither e&s;timate the de&s;ign, dignity, nor capacity of rea&s;on. Hurried blindfold by lu&s;t, pride or ava|rice, per&s;onal elevation is the motive, riches or grandeur the object, and deathle&s;s fame the antici|pated reward of their unabating enterpri&s;e. Alex|ander and Julius Cae&s;ar are &s;triking examples of the de&s;potic influence of pa&s;&s;ion. Ignorant of &s;elf-command, and fearful of attacking &s;o rough, un|tried and formidable a fortre&s;s as their own hearts, they wandered abroad in pur&s;uit of &s;omething, which could equal their ambitious views. Wrap|ped in the illu&s;ions of fancy, the&s;e in&s;olent and over|bearing demagogues vainly hoped, that idiots, with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t principles of government, might honorably a&s;pire after, and &s;u&s;tain univer&s;al em|pire. The&s;e are two of numberle&s;s in&s;tances of the frenzy and di&s;traction, occa&s;ioned by checking the exerci&s;e, and re&s;i&s;ting the authority of rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="034648_0007_0FFF45F585F6C390">Another di&s;tingui&s;hing property of per&s;onal di&s;|cipline is fortitude, which enables the mind to bear in&s;olent treatment, originates ju&s;t conceptions of it's nature, and dictates the exerci&s;e of patience in devi&s;ing means of redre&s;s.</P>
<P>To oppo&s;e in&s;olence with forbearance is an im|portant chri&s;tian attainment. This is the genuine fruit of fortitude, which is a chief promoter of the dignity and u&s;efulne&s;s of man.</P>
<P>Rightly to comprehend an injury, to conceive of it's tendency, and to judge of the intended extent of it, are exceedingly nece&s;&s;ary, to proportion wi&s;e|ly our re&s;entment to it's de&s;erts. Precipitancy, jealou&s;y or petulance entirely prevent the&s;e acquire|ments. They delude the fancy, contract the un|der&s;tanding, warp the judgment, and &s;ear the con|&s;cience. Certainly then, a perfect &s;elf-command will totally exclude the&s;e vices, as enemies to liberal inve&s;tigation and oppo&s;ers of truth.</P>
<P>Fortitude is the de&s;irable and happy medium between in&s;en&s;ibility and ra&s;hne&s;s. It is not in|con&s;i&s;tent with a keen &s;en&s;e of injuries, neither is it &s;uperior to re&s;entment. It wi&s;ely di&s;crim|inates between a ha&s;ty and incon&s;iderate &s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion, and a deliberate provocation.</P>
<P>Equally di&s;tant is this virtue from cowardice as from in&s;en&s;ibility. Although it is not ha&s;ty to re|&s;ent an injury, it is prepared to repel it. Although it admits every honorable expedient to redre&s;s a grievance, to be preferable to &s;udden and open ho&s;tility, yet &s;aith it's brave and pious patron,
<PB N="10" REF="034648_0008_0FFF45FB36098EA0">
"Though an ho&s;t &s;hould encamp again&s;t me, yet will I not fear."</P>
<P>Diametrically oppo&s;ed to the conde&s;cending qual|ities of this amiable and chri&s;tian virtue, are the impetuo&s;ity, violence and pride of per&s;ons, who&s;e ambition is &s;olely directed to the taking of cities. In an oppo&s;ite &s;cale with the prudence, forbearance, patient inquiry, firmne&s;s and magnanimity of &s;uch as cultivate the former, may be placed the incon|&s;ideratene&s;s, temerity, avarice and in&s;olence of tho&s;e who cheri&s;h the latter, and this will lead to an impartial opinion of this part of their re&s;pective characters.</P>
<P>As &s;elf-government begets a noblene&s;s and elevation of &s;oul, to e&s;timate and endure inju|ries, it al&s;o originates a boldne&s;s of &s;entiment, an animated, rational and inextingui&s;hable cour|age.</P>
<P>Temperance and per&s;everance in the moment of &s;evere trial are prominent features in the heroi&s;m of a truly valiant man. Neither appalled by the approach of danger, nor alarmed by it's probable con&s;equences, his manly firmne&s;s and intrepidity &s;erve for a &s;hield, which the impetuous ardor of a ho&s;tile foe can never penetrate.</P>
<P>True courage is di&s;tingui&s;hed from it's counter|feit by a con&s;tant preparedne&s;s for the &s;evere&s;t con|flict, by a noble contempt of life and it's mo&s;t valu|ed comforts, when the intere&s;ts of liberty, virtue or religion are at hazard. Every partial or inter|e&s;ted con&s;ideration is &s;acrificed to the advancement of the public good.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="034648_0009_0FFF45FDD4DB3FA8">A man of courage exhau&s;ts not his ardor on tri|fling, ludicrous, or unimportant occa&s;ions, but wi&s;ely apportions it to the value of the object, and the urgency of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>This virtue is e&s;pecially di&s;tingui&s;hed from the licentious fury of an avaricious pur&s;uer of power or conque&s;t, as it is re&s;trained by rea&s;on, and re|ceives additional and well-directed fervor from exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Having taken this view of &s;ome of the di&s;crimi|nating properties of per&s;onal di&s;cipline, let us con|template it's mo&s;t important effects, and a&s;certain their preference to the di&s;graceful con&s;equences of an ungoverned lu&s;t of empire.</P>
<P>Undi&s;turbed reflections, equanimity and ration|al comfort are the &s;treams, ince&s;&s;antly flowing from this pure &s;ource, to refre&s;h the individual.</P>
<P>Entertaining only moderate views and rea&s;ona|ble expectations, having enlightened rea&s;on for his unerring and &s;ure guide, he is not precipitated into the tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion, which occa&s;ion a depar|ture from a &s;teady cour&s;e of virtuous practice. Always having command of his under&s;tanding and reflection, he is not fickle in his inclinations, nor un&s;table in his purpo&s;es. Being &s;ettled, re&s;olute and con&s;cientious, his mind is undi&s;turbed, his con|&s;cience calm, and all his reflections cheerful.</P>
<P>This perfect &s;elf-command is al&s;o a very happy mean of promoting the true dignity of man. It pre&s;erves in their proper &s;ubordination the infe|rior qualities of his nature. It gives full &s;cope to
<PB N="12" REF="034648_0010_0FFF45FF69DBED58">
the active energies of the mind. It completes the &s;ocial, moral and religious character.</P>
<P>On the other hand, an ambition for power or conque&s;t is always re&s;tle&s;s. Originating in &s;elfi&s;h and avaricious views, exerci&s;ing the corrupt and perver&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of the heart, and having for it's object the e&s;tabli&s;hment of univer&s;al de&s;poti&s;m, it tends to enervate the mind, to produce a con|&s;tant fermention in the heart, and la&s;tingly to check the exerci&s;e of every &s;ocial and pure &s;entiment.</P>
<P>The efficacy of &s;elf-government when exerci&s;ed by the members of a community, is al&s;o particular|ly noticeable, as it's tendency is, to promote and pre&s;erve harmony and order.</P>
<P>As per&s;onal comfort is the fruit of a peaceful and undi&s;turbed mind, &s;o the welfare and happine&s;s of a nation mu&s;t depend on a freedom from the exce&s;|&s;es of unbridled pa&s;&s;ion. A re&s;tle&s;s and peevi&s;h, an irritable and turbulent temper is a principal cau&s;e of the unea&s;ine&s;&s;es and contentions, the tumults and commotions, which have defaced the beauty, and in|terrupted the order of the moral kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Private grudges and public conte&s;ts, in connexion with the long train of calamities, re&s;ulting from war, may be traced to this impure and corrupt &s;ource.</P>
<P>Individuals and nations, who have lu&s;ted after conque&s;ts, have mi&s;taken their tendency, and the effects, they have generally produced. In&s;tead of enriching, they impoveri&s;h, in&s;tead of &s;trength|ening, they weaken a government. The re|&s;ources,
<PB N="13" REF="034648_0011_0FFF46021266EC18">
exten&s;ively di&s;tributed, are beyond the reach of being &s;uddenly called into action, or of a&s;&s;i&s;ting to ward off any unexpected or unfore|&s;een di&s;a&s;ter. The Romans therefore, are the only ancient nation, who have grown rich by their conque&s;ts, and this becau&s;e they exacted very little in the form of tribute.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prie&s;tly's Lectures on Hi&s;tory.</NOTE></P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition, which has often proved ruinous, and laid a foundation for national degradation and di&s;grace, it was an expre&s;s purpo&s;e of the Jew|i&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation to prohibit. They were forbid|den to undertake any wars through caprice, ambi|tion or a di&s;po&s;ition for conque&s;t, and as a check to the unnece&s;&s;ary wa&s;te and havock, which are au|thorized by the practice of other nations, were a&s;ked this &s;imple que&s;tion; Are the trees enemies, which can fight again&s;t you, &s;o that you mu&s;t cut them down?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jews' Letters in an&s;wer to Voltaire.</NOTE></P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition, example and in&s;tructions of our Divine Ma&s;ter and his immediate followers tend to undermine this corrupt principle. The number|le&s;s precepts, to guard again&s;t o&s;tentation, envy, pride, and to "take heed, and beware of covet|ou&s;ne&s;s," are &s;o many moral lectures on the im|portance of per&s;onal di&s;cipline, and are intended to prevent the growth of a tyrannical and domi|neering temper.</P>
<P>Hitherto in this country little encouragement has been found for the indulgence of an unrea&s;on|able de&s;ire of power, or a &s;pirit of conque&s;t. The
<PB N="14" REF="034648_0012_0FFF4604A4B7C7C0">
early education and habits of it's inhabitants, the laws, the government, and e&s;pecially the chri&s;tian religion are peculiarly favorable to the extinction of an ambitious and di&s;&s;ocial &s;pirit, and give all po&s;&s;ible patronage to the mild, peaceful and una&s;|piring qualities of the heart.</P>
<P>It &s;hould neither be charged to o&s;tentation nor ambition, if, from the hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent age, we adduce examples for an unequivocal illu&s;tration of the &s;entiment, we are endeavoring to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>To avail our&s;elves of a decided proof, that per|&s;onal di&s;cipline is preferable to a lu&s;t of empire, we need only contra&s;t the meek, contented, firm, courageous, unambitious and una&s;&s;uming di&s;po&s;i|tion of a WASHINGTON, with the proud, o&s;ten|tatious, lu&s;tful, and a&s;piring temper of a Buona|parte.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;e the unexam|pled patience and per&s;everance, magnanimity and well regulated independence of an ADAMS, to the head&s;trong lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, or even to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable attainments of all the proud plunder|ers and conquerors of the world.</P>
<P>Still more forcibly to demon&s;trate the idea, we may pur&s;ue the analogy between the moderation, forbearance, ju&s;tice and unvaried inflexibility of the SUPREME EXECUTIVE of our Nation, and the precipitancy, incon&s;tancy, violence and outrage, which have prevailingly dictated the mea&s;ures of the Directory of France.</P>
<P>The event of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t for dominion in the elder world, it is impo&s;&s;ible certainly to pre|dict.
<PB N="15" REF="034648_0013_0FFF459566AB75B8">
It &s;eems however, that no limits are fixed to their de&s;ires, nor any bounds &s;et to their efforts. If an opinion may be formed from the pa&s;t di&s;pen|&s;ations of providence, it appears, that a nation, which pre&s;umes to wage war with the univer&s;e, and in effect to a&s;&s;ume the prerogatives of its SU|PREME FORMER and GOVERNOR, mu&s;t be humbled.</P>
<P>After their wanton avowal of being in que&s;t of univer&s;al empire, and of it's being their fixed pur|po&s;e to fraternize and &s;ubjugate this we&s;tern world, the &s;ons of freedom mu&s;t be &s;eized with more than lethargic &s;tupidity, not to be arou&s;ed. When reminded of the political annihilation of Venice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the di&s;patches from our Envoys Extraordinary in France, to the Executive of the United States.</NOTE> as an example of their future deba&s;ement, and when the in&s;olent and perfidious treatment of Ita|ly, Holland and Switzerland <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A judicious, impartial and intere&s;ting detail of the conduct of France towards the&s;e nations, is contained in the "Ob&s;ervations on the Di&s;pute between The United States and France, addre&s;&s;ed by Robert Goodloe Har|per of South Carolina, to his con&s;tituents." Every candid peru&s;er will be &s;atisfied, that &s;uch in&s;tances of wantonne&s;s and in&s;incerity &s;hould in&s;pire the inhabitants of the&s;e States with caution and firmne&s;s.</NOTE> are candidly con&s;id|ered, the native energy of independent Americans will no longer &s;leep. The love of rational liberty, for which they are de&s;ervedly characterized, and a ju&s;t appreciation of the earnings of hone&s;t and la|borious indu&s;try, will command an obedient atten|tion to the calls of their country, and a willingne&s;s to make every rea&s;onable &s;acrifice for it's perma|nent &s;ecurity.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="034648_0014_0FFF4608DA9DD7C0">In a &s;ea&s;on of common danger, the benefit of a&s;|&s;ociations, formed to extend a knowledge of the military art, is readily perceived.

A hopeful pro&s;pect then pre&s;ents, of finding experi|enced veterans, who re&s;olutely re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t tran&s;|ports of pa&s;&s;ion, and who are impelled to action by a nobler motive than a love of conque&s;t. In &s;uch &s;chools, a knowledge of tactics is acquired, a &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e encouraged, and patterns of patience and intrepidity uniformly di&s;played.</P>
<P>The exemplary attention, which has been paid to the diffu&s;ion of military &s;kill, reflects honor on our rulers, as it is a demon&s;tration of their una|bating vigilance, and is a con&s;oling circum&s;tance at the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting period.

An equally generous principle with that, which then glowed in your bo&s;om, we doubt not, if cir|cum&s;tances require, will again &s;timulate you to ac|tion. On you we rely for an example of prudence to our youth, of re&s;traint, to check their natural impetuo&s;ity, and of wi&s;dom, to direct their ardor into it's proper channel. May the efficacy of your exertions be perceived, the re&s;pectability of your in&s;titution increa&s;e, and numbers in future be found, worthy of being added to your fair cata|logue of Patriots.</P>
<P>My Fellow Countrymen will permit me to con|gratulate them on the mixed moderation and per|&s;everance, coolne&s;s and deci&s;ion, wi&s;dom and up|rightne&s;s, which dignify the tran&s;actions of our government. The&s;e truly form a &s;plendid exhibi|tion of the glorious triumphs of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Every hone&s;t member of the community will feel indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged, to cultivate the &s;ame pa|cific and conde&s;cending temper. Such are the pre&s;ent limits of our country, that extent of terri|tory can be no motive with us, to endeavor to in|crea&s;e our power, or to enlarge our conque&s;ts. Our affluence and pro&s;perity have &s;o rapidly in|crea&s;ed, that it would be madne&s;s to apply to this
<PB N="19" REF="034648_0017_0FFF461199692080">
&s;ource for a valuable addition. Unle&s;s therefore the dignity of our government, or our rights as an independent nation are implicitly or openly di&s;put|ed, it will be honorable in us, to "&s;tudy the things, which make for peace," and to be anxious to ob|tain "no other conque&s;ts, but tho&s;e of the pa&s;|&s;ions, and no other triumphs, but tho&s;e of ju&s;tice and humanity."</P>
<P>For the acquiring of this di&s;po&s;ition we are to re|member, that the adventurer in the chri&s;tian war|fare is required, to be "temperate in all things." The licentiou&s;ne&s;s of ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions, and the vi&s;ionary projects of in&s;atiable ambition do not ac|cord with the requi&s;itions of the go&s;pel, or the &s;pi|rit of it's Divine Author. When pointed to "the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them," which are happily &s;uited to nouri&s;h the vanity of a corrupt heart, &s;o perfect was his &s;elf-command, that he viewed them as a gilded trifle, and the fe|licity they promi&s;ed, empty and delu&s;ive.</P>
<P>In attempting to copy this perfect pattern of &s;ubjection to the di&s;cipline of rea&s;on, it will be laudable in us, to aim after a humble but the great|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible re&s;emblance. The &s;ea&s;on of combat|ing our appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, and of endeavoring to &s;ubject them to the &s;ugge&s;tions of our under|&s;tanding, and the laws of the go&s;pel, will be but &s;hort. "Eternity will be long enough to repay us." There will then be a full di&s;play of the con|que&s;ts of rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="034648_0018_0FFF4613641A1890">The fading glories of this world will &s;oon lo&s;e their attraction. Uncorrupting palms of victory are promi&s;ed to the per&s;everingly patient, re&s;olute and intrepid. The faithful &s;ubjects of communi|ties and empires are then to be admitted into "a kingdom, which cannot be moved;" where the SUPREME LORD of the univer&s;e maintains an equitable and impartial dominion, and the righ|teous &s;hall come off conquerors, and "more than conquerors" over the enemies of their &s;piritual comfort, "through Him, who hath loved, and who hath given him&s;elf for us."</P>
