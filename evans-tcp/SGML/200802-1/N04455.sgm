<HEAD>A Letter, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Now give you my Thoughts on the <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> you lately &s;ent me. As you &s;et me the Ta&s;k, you mu&s;t take the Performance as it is without any Apology for its De|fects. I have wrote with the u&s;ual Freedom of a Friend, aiming at nothing but Truth, and to expre&s;s my &s;elf &s;o as to be under&s;tood. In order to <HI>an&s;wer</HI> your <HI>main Enquiry</HI> concerning the <HI>Extent</HI> of the <HI>civil Magi&s;trate's Power</HI> re&s;pect|ing RELIGION; I &s;uppo&s;e it needful to look back to the <HI>End,</HI> and therefore to the <HI>Original</HI> of it: By which Means I &s;up|po&s;e a ju&s;t Notion may be formed of what is properly <HI>their Bu|&s;ine&s;s</HI> or the <HI>Object</HI> of <HI>their Power;</HI> and &s;o without any in&s;u|perable Difficulty we may thence learn what is out of that Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>That the SACRED SCRIPTURES are the <HI>alone Rule</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> to a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> all <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are agreed in; and mu&s;t therefore inviolably maintain, that every Chri&s;tian has <HI>a Right of judging for him&s;elf</HI> what he is to believe and practice in Religion according to that Rule: Which I think on a full Examination you will find perfectly incon&s;i&s;tent with any Power in the civil Magi&s;trate to make any penal Laws in Matters of Religion. Tho' <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are agreed in the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of that Principle, yet too many in <HI>Practice</HI> have departed from it. The Evils that have been introduced thereby into the Chri&s;tian Church are more than can be reckoned up. Becau&s;e of the great Importance of it to the Chri&s;tian and to his &s;tanding fa&s;t in that <HI>Liberty</HI> wherewith CHRIST has made him free, you will not fault me if I am the longer upon it. The more firmly this is e&s;tabli&s;hed in our Minds; the more firm &s;hall we be again&s;t all Attempts upon our <HI>Chri&s;tian Liberty,</HI> and better practice that <HI>Chri&s;tian Charity</HI> towards &s;uch as are of different Sentiments from us in Religion that is &s;o much recommended
<PB N="2" REF="005520_0004_10184C9508831F78">
and inculcated in tho&s;e &s;acred Oracles, and which a ju&s;t Un|der&s;tanding of our <HI>Chri&s;tian Rights</HI> has a natural Tendency to influence us to. And tho' your Sentiments about &s;ome of tho&s;e Points you demand my Thoughts upon may have been different from mine; yet I per&s;wade my &s;elf, you will not think mine to be far from the Truth when you &s;hall have throughly weigh|ed what follows. But if I am mi&s;taken in the Grounds I pro|ceed upon or in any Conclu&s;ion drawn from true Premi&s;es, I &s;hall be thankful to have the &s;ame pointed out: Truth being what I &s;eek, to which all mu&s;t bow fir&s;t or la&s;t.</P>
<P>To proceed then as I have ju&s;t hinted, I &s;hall <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> briefly con&s;ider <HI>the Origin and End of Civil Government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to <HI>the Origin</HI>&mdash;Rea&s;on teaches us that <HI>all Men</HI> are <HI>naturally equal</HI> in Re&s;pect of <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> or <HI>Dominion</HI> one over ano|ther. Altho' true it is that <HI>Children</HI> are not born <HI>in</HI> this full State of Equality, yet they are born <HI>to</HI> it. Their <HI>Parents</HI> have a Sort of Rule &amp; Jurdi&s;diction over them when they come into the World, and for &s;ome Time after: But it is but a temporary one; which ari&s;es from that Duty incumbent on them to take Care of their Offspring during the imperfect State of Childhood, to pre&s;erve, nouri&s;h and educate them (as the Workman&s;hip of their own almighty MAKER, to whom they are to be accountable for them,) and govern the Actions of their yet ignorant Nonage, 'till <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> &s;hall take its Place and ea&s;e them of that Trouble. For GOD having given <HI>Man</HI> an <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> to direct his Actions, has given him therewith a <HI>Freedom</HI> of <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Acting,</HI> as properly belonging thereto, within the Bounds of <HI>that Law</HI> he is under: And whil&s;t he is in a State wherein he has no Under&s;tanding of his own to direct his Will, he is not to have any Will of his own to follow: He that under&s;tands for him mu&s;t will for him too.&mdash;But when he comes to &s;uch a State of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> as made the <HI>Father</HI> free, the &s;ame mu&s;t make the <HI>Son</HI> free too: For the <HI>Freedom</HI> of <HI>Man</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>acting</HI> according to his own <HI>Will</HI> (without being &s;ubject to the Will of another) is grounded on his having <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> which is able to in&s;truct him in <HI>that Law</HI> he is to govern him&s;elf by, and make him know how far he is left to the Freedom of his own Will. So that we are <HI>born Free</HI> as we are <HI>born Rational.</HI> Not that we have actually the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of either as &s;oon as born; <HI>Age</HI> that bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> too. <HI>This natural Freedom</HI> is not a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> what he plea&s;es without any Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rd to any <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Creature cannot but be

made under a <HI>Law</HI> from its MAKER: But it con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>Free|dom</HI> from any <HI>&s;uperiour Power on Earth,</HI> and not being under the Will or legi&s;lative Authority of <HI>Man,</HI> and having only the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> (or in other Words, of its MAKER) for his Rule.</P>
<P>And as Rea&s;on tells us, all are born thus <HI>naturally equal,</HI> i. e. with an <HI>equal Right</HI> to their <HI>Per&s;ons;</HI> &s;o al&s;o with an equal Right to their <HI>Pre&s;ervation;</HI> and therefore to <HI>&s;uch Things</HI> as Nature affords for their <HI>Sub&s;i&s;tence.</HI> For which Purpo&s;e GOD was plea&s;ed to make a Grant of <HI>the Earth in common</HI> to the <HI>Children of Men,</HI> fir&s;t to <HI>Adam</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>his Sons:</HI> as the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 115. 16. And altho' no one has originally a private Dominion exclu&s;ive of the re&s;t of Mankind in the Earth or its Products, as they are con&s;ider'd in this their natural State; yet &s;ince GOD has given <HI>the&s;e Things</HI> for the U&s;e of Men and given them <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> al&s;o to make U&s;e thereof to the be&s;t Advantage of Life; there mu&s;t of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity be a <HI>Means</HI> to <HI>appropriate</HI> them &s;ome Way or other, be|fore they can be of any U&s;e to any particular Per&s;on. And <HI>every Man</HI> having a <HI>Property</HI> in his own <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> the <HI>Labour of his Body</HI> and <HI>the Work of his Hands</HI> are properly his own, to which no one has Right but him&s;elf; it will therefore follow that when he removes any Thing out of the State that Nature has provided and left it in, he has <HI>mixed his Labour</HI> with it and joined &s;omething to it that is his own, and thereby makes it his Property. He having removed it out of the <HI>common State</HI> Nature placed it in, it hath by <HI>this Labour</HI> &s;omething annexed to it that excludes the common Right of others; becau&s;e <HI>this La|bour</HI> being the unque&s;tionable Property of the Labourer, no Man but he can have a Right to what that is once joined to, at lea&s;t where there is enough and as good left in common for others. Thus <HI>every Man</HI> having a <HI>natural Right</HI> to (or being the Pro|prietor of) his own <HI>Per&s;on</HI> and his own <HI>Actions</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> and to what he can hone&s;tly acquire by his Labour, which we call <HI>Property;</HI> it certainly follows, that no Man can have a Right to the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> or <HI>Property</HI> of <HI>another:</HI> And if every Man has a Right to his <HI>Per&s;on</HI> and <HI>Property;</HI> he has al&s;o a Right to <HI>de|fend</HI> them, and a Right to all the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Means of Defence,</HI> and &s;o has a Right of <HI>puni&s;hing</HI> all In&s;ults upon his Per&s;on and Property.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e in <HI>&s;uch a State of Nature,</HI> every Man mu&s;t be <HI>Judge</HI> of the Breach of the Law of Nature and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> too

(even in his own Ca&s;e) and the greater Part being no &s;trict Ob&s;ervers of Equity and Ju&s;tice; the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of Property in this State is <HI>not very &s;afe. Three Things</HI> are wanting in this State (as the celebrated <HI>Lock</HI> ob&s;erves) to render them &s;afe; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed known Law</HI> received and allowed by com|mon Con&s;ent to be the Standard of Right and Wrong, the com|mon Mea&s;ure to decide all Controver&s;ies between them: For tho' the Law of Nature be intelligible to all rational Crea|tures; yet Men being bia&s;&s;ed by their Intere&s;t as well as igno|rant for Want of the Study of it, are not apt to allow of it as a Law binding to them in the Application of it to their parti|cular Ca&s;es. There wants al&s;o a <HI>known and indifferent Judge</HI> with Authority to determine all Differences according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Law: for Men are too apt to be partial to them|&s;elves, and too much wanting in a ju&s;t Concern for the Intere&s;t of others. There often wants al&s;o in a State of Nature, a <HI>Power to back and &s;upport the Sentence</HI> when right, and give it due Execution.&mdash;Now to remedy the&s;e Inconveniencies, <HI>Rea|&s;on</HI> teaches Men to <HI>join in Society,</HI> to unite together into a Com|monwealth under &s;ome Form or other, to make a Body of Laws agreable to the Law of Nature, and in&s;titute one com|mon Power to &s;ee them ob&s;erved.&mdash;It is they who thus unite together, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the People, who make and alone have Right to make the Laws that are to take Place among them; or which comes to the &s;ame Thing, appoint tho&s;e who &s;hall make them, and who &s;hall &s;ee them executed.&mdash;For every Man has an equal Right to the Pre&s;ervation of his Per&s;on and Property; and &s;o an equal Right to e&s;tabli&s;h a Law, or to nominate the Makers and Executors of the Laws which are the Guardians both of Per&s;on and Property.</P>
<P>Hence then the Fountain and Original of all civil Power is from the People, and is certainly in&s;tituted for their Sakes; or in other Words, which was the <HI>&s;econd Thing</HI> propo&s;ed, <HI>The great End of civil Government,</HI> is <HI>the Pre&s;ervation of their Per&s;ons, their Liberties and E&s;tates, or their Property.</HI> Mo&s;t certain it is, that it mu&s;t be for their own Sakes, the rendering their Condition better than it was in what is called a State of Nature (a State without &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;h'd Laws as before men|tioned, or without any common Power) that Men would willingly put them&s;elves out of that State. It is nothing but <HI>their own Good</HI> can be any rational Inducement to it: and to &s;uppo&s;e they either &s;hould or would do it on any other, is to
<PB N="5" REF="005520_0007_10184C9E76AA27E8">
&s;uppo&s;e rational Creatures ought to change their State with a De&s;ign to make it wor&s;e. And <HI>that Good</HI> which in &s;uch a State they find a need of, is no other then a <HI>greater Security of En|joyment of what belonged to them.</HI> That and that only can then be the true Rea&s;on of their uniting together in &s;ome Form or other they judge be&s;t for the obtaining that greater Security. <HI>That greater Security</HI> therefore of Life, Liberty, Money, Lands, Hou&s;es, Family, and the like, which may be all comprehended under that of <HI>Per&s;on</HI> and <HI>Property,</HI> is the <HI>&s;ole End</HI> of all <HI>civil Government.</HI> I mean not that all civil Governments (as &s;o called) are thus con&s;tituted: (tho' the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and &s;ome few other Nations are through a merciful Providence &s;o happy as to have &s;uch.) There are too too many arbitrary Governments in the World, where the People don't make their own Laws. The&s;e are not properly &s;peaking <HI>Governments</HI> but <HI>Tyrannies;</HI> and are ab&s;olutely again&s;t the <HI>Law of</HI> GOD and <HI>Nature.</HI> But I am con&s;idering Things as they be in their own Nature, what Rea&s;on teaches concerning them: and herein have given <HI>a &s;hort Sketch</HI> of what the celebrated Mr. <HI>Lock</HI> in <HI>his Treati&s;e of Government</HI> has largely demon&s;trated; and in which it is ju&s;tly to be pre&s;umed all are agreed who under&s;tand the natural Rights of Mankind.</P>
<P>Thus having &s;een what the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>civil Government</HI> is; I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;ee a fair Foundation laid for the Determination of the <HI>next Thing</HI> I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider: Which is, <HI>What Liberty or Power belonging to Man as he is a rea&s;onable Creature does every Man give up to the civil Government whereof he is a Member.</HI>&mdash;Some Part of their natural Liberty they do certainly give up to the Government, for the Benefit of Society and mutual Defence, (for in a political Society <HI>every one</HI> even an <HI>Infant</HI> has the whole Force of the Community to protect him) and &s;omething therefore is certainly given up to the Whole for this Purpo&s;e.&mdash;Now the Way to know what Branches of natural Liberty are <HI>given up,</HI> and what <HI>remain</HI> to us after our Admi&s;|&s;ion into civil Society, is to con&s;ider <HI>the Ends</HI> for which Men enter into a State of Government.&mdash;For &s;o much Liberty and no more is departed from, as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure tho&s;e Ends; the re&s;t is certainly our own &s;till. And here I &s;uppo&s;e with the before-mentioned noble A&s;&s;ertor of the Liberties of humane Nature; <HI>all that is given up</HI> may be reduced to <HI>two Heads.</HI>&mdash;1&s;t. The <HI>Power</HI> that every one has in a State of Nature <HI>to do whatever he judgeth &s;it,</HI> for the <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> of his <HI>Per&s;on</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="005520_0008_10184CA12E8CA428">
<HI>Property</HI> and that of others al&s;o, within the Permi&s;&s;ion of the Law of Nature, he gives up to be regulated by Laws made by the Society, &s;o far forth as the <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> of him&s;elf (his <HI>Per+&s;on</HI> and <HI>Property</HI>) and the re&s;t of that Society &s;hall require And, 2. The <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>puni&s;hing</HI> he wholly gives up, and en|gages his natural Force (which he might before employ in the Execution of the Law of Nature by his own &s;ingle Authority as he thought fit) to a&s;&s;i&s;t the executive Power of the Society as the Law thereof &s;hall require. For (he adds) being now in a <HI>new State</HI> wherein he is to enjoy many Conveniencies, from the Labour A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Society of others in the &s;ame Com|munity, as well as Protection from its whole Strength; he is to part al&s;o with as much of his natural Liberty and providing for him&s;elf, as the Good and Safety of the Society &s;hall re|quire; which is not only <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> but <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> &s;ince the other Members of the Society do the like. Now if the giving up <HI>the&s;e Powers</HI> be <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> to an&s;wer <HI>tho&s;e Ends</HI> for which Men enter into a State of Government, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the better Security of their Per&s;ons and Properties; then no more is parted with; and therefore <HI>all the re&s;t</HI> is ours &s;till. This I re&s;t on as certain, that <HI>no more natural Liberty or Power is given up than is nece&s;&s;ary for the Pre&s;ervation of Per&s;on and Property.</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ign not to mention many Particulars which according to this Rule I &s;uppo&s;e are not parted with by entering into a State of Government: what is reducible to <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two general Heads</HI> is &s;ufficient to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.&mdash;Tho' as I pa&s;s I cannot forbear taking notice of <HI>one Point of Liberty</HI> which all Members of a free State and particularly <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> think belonging to them, and are fond of; and that is the <HI>Right</HI> that <HI>every one</HI> has <HI>to &s;peak his Sentiments openly</HI> concerning <HI>&s;uch Matters as affect the good of the whole.</HI> Every Member of a Community ought to be concerned for the <HI>whole,</HI> as well as for <HI>his particular Part:</HI> His Life and all, as to this World is as it were embark|ed in the &s;ame Bottom, and is perpetually intere&s;ted in the good or ill Succe&s;s thereof: Whenever therefore he &s;ees a <HI>Rock</HI> on which there is a Probability the Ve&s;&s;el may &s;plit, or if he &s;ees a <HI>Sand</HI> that may &s;wallow it up, or if he fore&s;ees a <HI>Storm</HI> that is like to ari&s;e; his own Intere&s;t is too deeply concerned not to give Notice of the Danger: And the Right he has to his own Life and Property gives him a Right to &s;peak his Sentiments. If the <HI>Pilot</HI> or <HI>Captain</HI> don't think fit to take any Notice of it, yet it &s;eems to be certain they have no Right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="7" REF="005520_0009_10184CA3DA3AA150">
of him who thinks he e&s;pys Danger to the whole Ships Crew, or to puni&s;h the well-meaning Informer. A Man would &s;carce de&s;erve the Character of a <HI>good Member of Society</HI> who &s;hould re&s;olve to be &s;ilent on all Occa&s;ions, and never mind, &s;peak or guard again&s;t the Follies or Ignorance or Mi&s;takes of tho&s;e at the Helm. And Government rather incourages than takes away a Liberty, the U&s;e of which is &s;o needful and often very beneficial to the Whole, as Experience has abundantly &s;hown.</P>
<P>But not to detain you here,</P>
<P>I. The Members of a civil State or Society do <HI>retain</HI> their na|tural Liberty <HI>in all &s;uch Ca&s;es</HI> as have <HI>no Relation</HI> to the <HI>Ends</HI> of &s;uch a Society.&mdash;In a State of Nature Men had a Right to read <HI>Milton</HI> or <HI>Lock</HI> for their In&s;truction or Amu&s;ement: and why they do not retain this Liberty under a Government that is in&s;tituted for the <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> of their <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> is inconceivable. From whence can &s;uch a Society derive any Right to hinder them from doing that which does not affect the <HI>Ends</HI> of that Society? Should a Government therefore re|&s;train the free U&s;e of <HI>the Scriptures,</HI> prohibit Men the reading of them, and make it Penal to examine and &s;earch them; it would be a manife&s;t U&s;urpation upon the common Rights of Mankind, as much a Violation of natural Liberty as the Attack of a Highwayman upon the Road can be upon our civil Rights. And indeed with re&s;pect to the <HI>&s;acred Writings,</HI> Men might not only read them if the Government did prohibit the &s;ame, but they would be bound by a higher Authority to read them, not|with&s;tanding any humane Prohibition. The Pretence of any Authority to re&s;train Men from reading the &s;ame, is wicked as well as vain.&mdash;But whether in &s;ome Ca&s;es that have no Rela|tion to the <HI>Ends</HI> of Government and wherein therefore Men retain their natural Liberty; if the civil Authority &s;hould at|tempt by a Law to re&s;train Men, People might not be oblig'd to &s;ubmit therein, is not here at all the Que&s;tion: tho' I &s;up|po&s;e that in &s;uch Ca&s;e wherein they ought to &s;ubmit, the Obli|gation thereto would ari&s;e from &s;ome other Con&s;ideration, and not from the &s;uppo&s;ed Law; there being no binding Force in a Law where a rightful Authority to make the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is wanting.</P>

And as every Chri&s;tian is &s;o bound; &s;o he has an <HI>unalienable Right</HI> to <HI>judge</HI> of the <HI>Sen&s;e and Meaning</HI> of it, and to follow his Judgment wherever it leads him; even an equal Right with any Rulers be they Civil or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical.&mdash;This I &s;ay, I take to be an original Right of the humane Nature, and &s;o far from being given up by the Individuals of a Community that it cannot be given up by them if they &s;hould be &s;o weak as to offer it. Man by his Con&s;titu|tion as he is a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Being capable of the Knowledge of his MAKER; is a <HI>moral &amp; accountable</HI> Being: and therefore as every one is accountable for him&s;elf, he mu&s;t rea&s;on, judge and de|termine for him&s;elf. That Faith and Practice which depends on the Judgment and Choice of any other Per&s;on, and not on the Per&s;on's own Under&s;tanding Judgment and Choice, may pa&s;s for Religion in the Synagogue of <HI>Satan,</HI> who&s;e Tenet is that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion; but with no under&s;tand|ing Prote&s;tant will it pa&s;s for any Religion at all. No Action is a religious Action without Under&s;tanding and Choice in the Agent. Whence it follows, the Rights of Con&s;cience are &s;a|cred and equal in all, and &s;trictly &s;peaking unalienable. This <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>judging every one for him&s;elf in Matters of Religion</HI> re|&s;ults from the Nature of Man, and is &s;o in&s;eperably connected therewith, that a Man can no more part with it than he can with his <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Thinking:</HI> and it is equally rea&s;onable for him to attempt to &s;trip him&s;elf of the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Rea&s;oning,</HI> as to attempt the ve&s;ting of another with this Right. And who|ever invades this Right of another, be he <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> may with equal Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ume the other's Power of Thinking, and &s;o level him with the Brutal Creation.&mdash;A Man may alienate &s;ome Branches of his Property and give up his Right in them to others; but he cannot transfer the <HI>Rights</HI> of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> un|le&s;s he could de&s;troy his rational and moral Powers, or &s;ub&s;ti|tute &s;ome other to be judged for him at the Tribunal of GOD.</P>
<P>But what may further clear this Point and at the &s;ame Time &s;hew the <HI>Extent</HI> of this <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>private Judgment</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> is this Truth, That the <HI>&s;acred Scriptures</HI> are the alone Rule of Faith and Practice to every individual Chri&s;tian. Were it needful I might ea&s;ily &s;how, the &s;acred Scriptures have all the Character nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a ju&s;t and proper Rule of Faith and Practice, and that they alone have them.&mdash;It is

&s;ufficient for all &s;uch as acknowledge the divine Authority of the Scriptures, briefly to ob&s;erve, that GOD the Author has therein declared he has given and de&s;igned them to be our only Rule of Faith and Practice. Thus &s;ays the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 15, 16; That they <HI>are given by In&s;piration from</HI> GOD, <HI>and are profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correcti|on, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s; that the Man of</HI> GOD <HI>may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto every good Work.</HI> So the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> in his Go&s;pel, Chap. 20. Ver. 31. &s;ays; <HI>The&s;e Things are written that ye might believe that</HI> JESUS <HI>is the</HI> CHRIST, <HI>the</HI> SON <HI>of</HI> GOD, <HI>and that believing ye might have Life through his Name.</HI> And in his <HI>fir&s;t Epi&s;tle,</HI> Chap. 5. Ver. 13. <HI>The&s;e Things have I written, that ye may know that ye have eternal Life, and that ye may believe on the Name of the</HI> SON <HI>of</HI> GOD. The&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages &s;how that what was written was to be the &s;tand|ing Rule of Faith and Practice, compleat and mo&s;t &s;ufficient for &s;uch an End, de&s;igned by infinite Wi&s;dom in the giving them, containing every Thing needful to be known and done by Chri&s;tians, or &s;uch as believe on the Name of the SON of GOD. Now ina&s;much as the Scriptures are the only Rule of Faith and Practice to a Chri&s;tian; then every one has an un|alienable Right to read, enquire into, and impartially judge of the Sen&s;e and Meaning of it for him&s;elf. For if he is to be governed and determined therein by the Opinions and Deter|minations of any others, the Scriptures cea&s;e to be a Rule to him, and tho&s;e Opinions or Determinations of others are &s;ub|&s;tituted in the Room thereof. But you will &s;ay, <HI>The Prie&s;t's Lips &s;hould keep Knowledge, and they &s;hould &s;eek the Law at his Mouth,</HI> Mal.&mdash;7.&mdash;Yes; that is, it is their Duty to ex|plain the Scriptures, and the People's Duty at the &s;ame Time to &s;earch the Scriptures to &s;ee whether tho&s;e Things they &s;ay are &s;o. <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 11. The Officers CHRIST has commi&s;|&s;ioned in his Church, as <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> are to teach his Laws, to explain as they are able the Mind &amp; Will of CHRIST laid down in the Scriptures; but they have no Warrant to make any Laws for them, nor are their Sentiments the Rule to any Chri&s;tian, who are <HI>all commanded</HI> to <HI>prove all Things,</HI> to <HI>try the Spirits whether they be of</HI> GOD. 1 Thes. 5. 21. 1 Joh. 4. 1. <HI>I &s;peak as to wi&s;e Men,</HI> &s;ays PAUL, <HI>judge ye what I &s;ay,</HI> 1 Cor. 10. 15. The&s;e and many other Texts I might have alledg'd, entirely an&s;wer the Objection, and e&s;tabli&s;h the Point before us.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005520_0012_10184CAC957433E8">
The Evidence of the Point before us ari&s;es out of the <HI>Nature</HI> of a <HI>Rule of Faith and Practice.</HI> For a Rule of Faith and Practice is certainly <HI>that</HI> from which we mu&s;t take and rectify all our Conceptions, and by which we ought to regulate all our Actions, concerning all tho&s;e Matters to which this Rule re|lates. As it is the <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Faith,</HI> we mu&s;t receive no Doctrines but what that contains: otherwi&s;e our Faith is not directed by that Rule; but other Things in that Ca&s;e are taken up and believed for Truths which that Rule takes no Notice of; and therefore it is done on &s;ome other Authority, which in Reality therefore becomes our Rule, in&s;tead of that which of Right ought to be &s;o. A <HI>Rule,</HI> con&s;idered as &s;uch, is a Mea&s;ure or Director with which a Thing is to be compared and made to agree: And therefore a Rule of Faith and Prac|tice is <HI>that</HI> which being applied to our Minds directs and regu|lates them, by informing the Under&s;tanding and guiding the Will, and &s;o influencing all our Actions. <HI>That</HI> which is the <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI> mu&s;t point out to us and teach us the &s;eve|ral Doctrines and inform us of the &s;everal Facts which we are to believe: And if we have entertained any wrong Notions or erroneous Opinions, they are to be corrected and regulated, by being compared and made to agree with this Rule. So al&s;o the <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Practice</HI> is <HI>that</HI> from which we are to learn the &s;everal Duties we are to perform, and how all our Actions are to be regulated.&mdash;'Tis the Nature of a Rule of Faith and Practice to include all this. <HI>That</HI> whereby Men examine into the Truth of any Thing, is to them the Rule of Truth; <HI>that</HI> from whence they learn what they ought to believe, is to them the Rule of Faith; and <HI>that</HI> to which they conform their Ac|tions, is their Rule of Practice. If Men receive the Doctrines pre&s;cribed to them by the <HI>Pope,</HI> by a <HI>Council,</HI> by a <HI>Convocation</HI> or a <HI>Parliament,</HI> from the Writings of <HI>Fathers,</HI> or <HI>any Doctors</HI> of Learning and Reputation, and conform their Actions to the Dictates and Commands of any of the&s;e or &s;uch like Authori|ties; the Authority to which they give this Honour, is un|doubtedly the Rule of their Faith and Practice. And &s;o if we &s;ubmit our &s;elves truly and impartially to the Authority of CHRIST, and &s;earch for the Truths we are to believe, and the Duties we are to perform in his <HI>written Word;</HI> then only do we make Him our Director and Guide, and the Scriptures the Rule of our Faith and Practice. And it is the <HI>&s;acred Scrip|tures alone</HI> which have this Right to our intire Submi&s;&s;ion, as
<PB N="11" REF="005520_0013_10184CAE1D45A318">
now de&s;cribed: and no other Authority which has yet been or ever &s;hall be &s;et up, has any Manner of Right at all to go|vern and direct our <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> in <HI>religious</HI> Matters.</P>
<P>This is a Truth of too great Importance for a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> ever in any Mea&s;ure to give up; and is &s;o clear and obvious a Truth, as may well pa&s;s for a &s;elf-evident Maxim, <HI>That a Chri&s;tian is to receive his Chri&s;tianity from</HI> CHRIST <HI>alone.</HI> For what is it which is nece&s;&s;arily implied and &s;uppo&s;ed in the very Notion of a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> but this, that he is a Follower and Di&s;ciple of CHRIST, one who receives and profe&s;&s;es to be|lieve his Doctrines as true, and &s;ubmits to his Commands? And &s;o far only as any does this, is he a <HI>Chri&s;tian:</HI> and &s;o far therefore as he receives or admits any other Doctrines or Laws, is he to be denominated from that Per&s;on or Sect, from who&s;e Authority or In&s;truction he receives them.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Society</HI> ought to be &s;ubject only to its own proper Legi&s;lature. The Truth of this is evident at the fir&s;t View; and civil Societies readily adhere to this as an inviolable Prin|ciple. And this holds equally true with Re&s;pect to <HI>religious</HI> or <HI>civil Societies;</HI> and therefore as in the <HI>Church</HI> of CHRIST no other Power or Authority may be admitted but that of CHRIST alone; &s;o no Laws may be made for, or any Doctrines be taught and enjoined upon the Church of CHRIST be&s;ides tho&s;e he has made and taught and enjoined. The Laws of <HI>England</HI> are what the Legi&s;lature of <HI>England</HI> has pa&s;&s;ed into Laws; not what any other Power or Authority in&s;titute or teach un|der that Name. And what the&s;e are, cannot be known from any other but the Law makers, by the Publications they have made and authorized. The Doctrines of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> (if that by a Figure may be called &s;o) are &s;uch as that Church and its Legi&s;lature a&s;&s;ert and own. So the Doctrines or Re|ligion of CHRIST, is only that which he has appointed and taught, and all that is contained in Scripture: every Thing el&s;e is of <HI>Men only,</HI> and no Part of the Chri&s;tian Religion. What is taught by any e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, and not contained in Scripture, is indeed the Doctrine of that Church, but not of CHRIST: For none can make Laws to oblige the Church of CHRIST but CHRIST him&s;elf. The Church of CHRIST as &s;uch, mu&s;t receive its Laws from CHRIST only; <HI>i. e.</HI> from the <HI>Scriptures:</HI> for they are to be found no where el&s;e. The <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> is that which CHRIST has taught; and therefore what he has not taught, but &s;ome other Per&s;on, is not
<PB N="12" REF="005520_0014_10184CAFD5848798">
the Chri&s;tian Religion. So al&s;o the <HI>Church</HI> of CHRIST is that which is founded according to the Directions and Model by him laid down. <HI>That</HI> therefore which is not &s;o founded, but upon Principles and Regulations laid down by Men, is &s;o far not a Church of CHRIST, but of <HI>Men:</HI> And in all the&s;e Things the <HI>Scriptures</HI> only can be our Rule. For we cannot know what CHRIST teaches and commands, from what he does not &s;ay, and what is &s;aid only by &s;ome other Per&s;on, but it mu&s;t be from what he does teach and command; and all <HI>that</HI> is contained in his <HI>Word.</HI></P>
<P>Again, if CHRIST be the <HI>Lord</HI> of the <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> the &s;ole King in his own Kingdom; then it will follow, that <HI>all &s;uch</HI> as in any Manner or Degree <HI>a&s;&s;ume</HI> the Power of directing and governing the Con&s;ciences of Men, are ju&s;tly chargeable with <HI>invading</HI> his rightful Dominion; He alone having the Right they claim. Should the King of <HI>France</HI> take it into his Head to pre&s;cribe Laws to the Subjects of the King of <HI>Great Bri|tain;</HI> who would not &s;ay, it was an Inva&s;ion of and In&s;ult offer'd to the <HI>Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature.</HI></P>
<P>I might al&s;o add, That for any to <HI>a&s;&s;ume</HI> the Power of di|recting the <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> of Men, not leaving them to the <HI>Scrip|tures</HI> alone, is evidently a <HI>declaring them</HI> to be <HI>defective</HI> and in|&s;ufficient to that Purpo&s;e; and therefore that our LORD who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s left us the <HI>Scriptures</HI> for that Purpo&s;e, did not know what was nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ufficient for us, and has given us a Law, the Defects of which were to be &s;upplied by the Wi&s;dom of &s;ome of his own wi&s;er Di&s;ciples. How high an Impeachment this is of his infinite Wi&s;dom, &s;uch would do well to con&s;ider, who <HI>impo&s;e</HI> their own Doctrines, Interpretations or Deci&s;ions upon any Men by Puni&s;hments, legal Incapacities, or any other Methods be&s;ides tho&s;e u&s;ed and directed to in the &s;acred Scrip|tures.</P>
<P>And as all <HI>Impo&s;ers</HI> on Men's Con&s;ciences are guilty of Re|bellion again&s;t GOD and CHRIST, of manife&s;t Di&s;obedience to and Contempt of their Authority and Commands; &s;o all they <HI>who &s;ubmit</HI> their Con&s;ciences to any &s;uch unju&s;t u&s;urp'd Authority, be&s;ides the Share which &s;uch Per&s;ons nece&s;&s;arily have in the Guilt of the U&s;urpers, as countenancing and giving in to their illegal Claim and &s;upporting their wicked Preten|&s;ions, they do likewi&s;e <HI>renounce Subjection</HI> to the Authority and Laws of CHRIST. To &s;ubmit our Con&s;ciences to the Gui|dance of any Man or Order of Men, is not to rea&s;on and act
<PB N="13" REF="005520_0015_10184CB2C0E2B328">
according to our own Under&s;tanding; but to take every thing for true, that our &s;piritual Guide affirms to be &s;o, and that meerly upon his Authority, without examining into, or &s;eeing the Truth and Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it: And in every In&s;tance wherein we thus &s;ubmit our &s;elves to the Direction of any humane Authority, &s;o far we &s;et a&s;ide and renounce all other Authority, our own Light and Rea&s;on, and even the Word of GOD and CHRIST: And the Authority of the Guide we &s;ub|ject our &s;elves unto is &s;ub&s;tituted in the Stead of all the&s;e. If we mu&s;t be directed and governed by any humane Power, it concerns us not what any other may teach and command; this the being &s;ubject to a Power nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es and in|cludes. An <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> is &s;ubject to the Crown and Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and has nothing to do with the Laws and Courts of Judicature in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>any other State,</HI> but di&s;owns and renounces all Obedience thereto. This is a univer&s;al Rule: And therefore if our Con&s;ciences are under the Direc|tion of any humane Authority as to religious Matters; they cea&s;e to be under the Direction of CHRIST. What CHRIST him&s;elf has told us is infallibly true, that <HI>no Man can &s;erve two Ma&s;ters, but he mu&s;t unavoidably prefer the one and neglect the other:</HI> And con&s;equently whoever looks upon him&s;elf to be under the Direction and Government of any humane Power in Matters of Religion, does thereby renounce the Authority of CHRIST, and withdraw Obedience from him.</P>
<P>From <HI>the&s;e Principles,</HI> we have here laid down, which can't but be held as indubitably true by every con&s;i&s;tent <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> THESE COROLLARIES may be deduced.</P>
<P>I. That the <HI>civil Authority</HI> hath no Power to make or ordain Articles of Faith, Creeds, Forms of Wor&s;hip or Church Go|vernment. This I think evidently follows from what has been &s;aid, that they can have no Power to decree any <HI>Articles of Faith.</HI> For the&s;e are already e&s;tabli&s;hed by CHRIST him&s;elf; and for <HI>Mortals</HI> to pretend any Right of Determination what others &s;hall believe, is really to u&s;urp that Authority which belongs to CHRIST the &s;upream King and Head of his Church; who only hath and can have a Right to pre&s;cribe to the Con&s;ciences of Men, as is evident from the la&s;t foregoing Head. So it al&s;o follows, that they have no Power to decree <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies</HI> in Religion, or <HI>Forms</HI> of <HI>divine Wor&s;hip.</HI> And this not only becau&s;e the&s;e Things have no Relation to the <HI>Ends</HI> of civil Society; it no Ways concerns the Common-Wealth or any

Member of it, whether Men pray kneeling or &s;tanding, whe|ther the Sign of the Cro&s;s be u&s;ed or omitted in Bapti&s;m, that this or the other Ceremony be made u&s;e of in the Church; but al&s;o becau&s;e this is already &s;ufficiently done by CHRIST in the <HI>&s;acred Scriptures.</HI> The&s;e contain every Thing needful to be known or done by Chri&s;tians. It is CHRIST'S &s;ole Prero|gative to in&s;titute the whole and every Part of religious Wor|&s;hip. Who can tell what Homage will be plea&s;ing to GOD but He him&s;elf? Or in what Way the Creature &s;hall attend upon him for the Obtainment of any &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ing but He him&s;elf? Can a <HI>Creature</HI> connect a divine Ble&s;&s;ing with any of its own invented Methods of Wor&s;hip? Or oblige him to be plea&s;ed or di&s;plea&s;ed in any other Way, or upon any other Terms, but tho&s;e him&s;elf has made and propo&s;ed, and which are all manife&s;tly contained in the <HI>Scriptures?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Objection,</HI> If it &s;hould be here <HI>objected,</HI> That although CHRIST has in&s;tituted every Part of religious Wor&s;hip; yet the <HI>particular Mode</HI> or Manner wherein &s;ome of tho&s;e Acts are to be attended he has not &s;pecially pointed out, which therefore mu&s;t be determined in order to perform the in&s;titu|ted Act of Wor&s;hip: And why therefore may not the <HI>civil</HI> Authority determine <HI>&s;uch Modes</HI> of Wor&s;hip as well as <HI>eccle|&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Rulers?</P>
<P>I know very well, &s;ome are fond of that Notion, that the <HI>Church</HI> (by which they mean the <HI>Church Officers</HI> or <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical Rulers</HI> in &s;ome Form or other con&s;ider'd and acting) has Power to decree <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies</HI> in Religion: and I am as willing for the pre&s;ent to allow the <HI>civil</HI> Authority has as much Power to do it, as tho&s;e <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Rulers;&mdash;becau&s;e for any Thing I can tell at pre&s;ent, my Neck might be as ea&s;y under the U&s;urpation of a <HI>civil</HI> Ruler, as an <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> one: But <HI>neither of 'em</HI> have any Power of determining in the Ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>As to <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Rulers, CHRIST has preci&s;ely bounded their Authority. They are to do what he has bid them, they are to open and explain their LORD'S Will to others, or in a Word to teach Men CHRIST'S Laws. For this I appeal to their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion, Math.</HI> 28. 20. And as this bounds their Authority on the one Side, &s;o it draws the Line or Bound of Submi&s;&s;ion on the other. When they teach us the Mind and Will of CHRIST our common Lord and Ma&s;ter; we are to hearken with Deference to them: but if they get out of that

Line, and teach (or decree, I care not what you call it) &s;ome Thing that is <HI>not</HI> his Will, &s;omething to be <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for me to do in Religion which CHRIST has not made &s;o; no Regard is due to them therein. And I &s;uppo&s;e I may venture to &s;ay, <HI>no one Ceremony</HI> in Religion or <HI>Modality</HI> of any Act of in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip, that has been devi&s;ed and decreed by any &s;ince the Apo&s;tles Days as nece&s;&s;ary, exclu&s;ive of any other, either was or is <HI>really nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for a Chri&s;tian to do in attending the&s;e Acts of Religion or Parts of in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip: At lea&s;t I know of no one: to be &s;ure &s;uch as have been the Subjects of De|bate between the <HI>Church of England</HI> on the one Side and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> from that <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> on the othe; are <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary.</HI> The decreeing &s;uch <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary Modalities</HI> of Religion therefore are without any Warrant from CHRIST: They teach therein what he has not commanded them, and no Chri&s;tian is bound to regard them therein.</P>
<P>But that the <HI>Objection</HI> may have a full and clear <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> I offer a few Words farther.&mdash;The <HI>Objection</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, that the <HI>Mode</HI> of performing &s;ome Acts of in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip is not de|termined by CHRIST, which mu&s;t therefore be determined by <HI>Man</HI> in order to perform &s;uch Act of Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>To which I &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. If there be <HI>&s;everal Modes</HI> wherein &s;uch Act or Acts of in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip may be performed, Man may not determine the one exclu&s;ive of the other; and if there be <HI>but one Mode</HI> wherein it can be attended, there is indeed no Occa&s;ion for a Determination upon it, all mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity agree in &s;uch a Mode of performing it. But in the former Ca&s;e, no Deter|mination may be made that it &s;hall be performed only after &s;uch a particular Mode, when it may be performed after another Manner as well. As for In&s;tance, <HI>Public Prayer</HI> may be per|formed either <HI>&s;tanding</HI> or <HI>kneeling:</HI> it being &s;uppo&s;ed that CHRIST has not determined the one Mode or the other; in &s;uch Ca&s;e Man may not determine that it &s;hall be performed only &s;tanding, or only kneeling; the Wor&s;hippers mu&s;t be left to their Liberty as CHRIST has left it: For it being the only Rea&s;on why Man may determine any Thing relating to an Act of Religion or divine Wor&s;hip, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of &s;uch a Determination in order to the obeying a Law of CHRIST; then it is certain, where that Nece&s;&s;ity is not found (as in the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e) there no &s;uch exclu&s;ive Determination may be made&punc; the&s;e Matters of divine Wor&s;hip, CHRIST'S Officers have no|thing

to do but to teach CHRIST'S Laws; and Chri&s;tians no|thing el&s;e but to obey CHRIST'S Laws. It is therefore certain, that if all CHRIST'S Laws relating thereto may be ob&s;erved, without the Determination of this or the other Ceremony or Mode of attending them; then the Determination of this or the other Ceremony as a Rule of Action for Chri&s;tians, falls not within the Compa&s;s of the Power of Man or any Order of Men. And I think the keeping to this Rule alone, that Man's Power in the&s;e Matters extends no farther than to a Determination of tho&s;e Things <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to be determined in order to the performing of CHRIST'S Commands, is the only Way to pre&s;erve CHRIST'S Wor&s;hip in its <HI>Purity.</HI>&mdash;Certain it is, that the going beyond it has &s;adly polluted it, and occa&s;ion|ed Divi&s;ions and Abundance of &s;inful Strife.</P>

If CHRIST had determined where and when the wor|&s;hipping A&s;&s;embly &s;hould meet, Man could not determine any Thing in the Matter: But &s;ince CHRIST has not; <HI>Time</HI> &amp; <HI>Place</HI> mu&s;t be determined by Man; el&s;e CHRIST'S Law in that Ca&s;e could not be obeyed. And becau&s;e that Law mu&s;t be obeyed, and can't be obeyed without &s;uch a Determination of Time &amp; Place; therefore it is, that Man may determine them, and is warranted to do it.&mdash;And every wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;embly be&s;t knowing their own particular Circum&s;tances, and being be&s;t able to judge what may be convenient or inconvenient in the Ca&s;e, are won't to fix Time and Place for the Purpo&s;e: And who has right to intermeddle in the Matter without their De&s;ire or Con&s;ent, I can't imagine. This is a Right our wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;emblies Claim, and I know not that any call it in Que&s;tion. Now altho' in this In&s;tance, wherein &s;omething falls <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> under the Determination of Man in order to Chri&s;tians obeying a Law of CHRIST, no Ceremony or Mode of Wor&s;hip is concerned; yet as I apprehend there is <HI>greater Rea&s;on</HI> why every wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;embly &s;hould be left free in an uninterrupted Enjoyment of this Right to determine the <HI>Mode</HI> of any Act of Wor&s;hip (undetermined by CHRIST) where there is a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of &s;uch a Determination in order to
<PB N="17" REF="005520_0019_10184CC178371D00">
obey his Laws: and that becau&s;e <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> is immediately concerned therein. As I have &s;aid before, I know not of &s;uch a Ca&s;e. Yet if Chri&s;tians do apprehend there is any <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> every wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;embly mu&s;t in that Ca&s;e determine for them&s;elves. They may be under a great Mi&s;take in determin|ing that to be <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> which may not be &s;o: but herein I think no others have a Power to determine for them. Not the <HI>civil Authority</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for the Rea&s;on before given, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That the Ceremony or particular Mode of performing an Act of divine Wor&s;hip, has no Relation to the <HI>Ends</HI> of a civil Society: The <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> of <HI>Per&s;on</HI> or <HI>Property,</HI> no Ways requires the giv|ing up this Liberty into the Hand of the civil Magi&s;trate. This therefore mu&s;t remain in the Individuals. The civil Intere&s;t of a State is no more affected, by <HI>kneeling</HI> or <HI>&s;tanding</HI> in <HI>Prayer,</HI> then by praying with the <HI>Eyes &s;hut</HI> or <HI>open;</HI> or by making the Figure of a <HI>Triangle</HI> or a <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> upon a Per&s;on in <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> than by making no Figure at all. They have indeed none of them any Relations to the <HI>Ends</HI> of a civil In&s;titution. The civil Authority therefore have no Bu&s;ine&s;s with it. Nor have the <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical Officers</HI> Authority to determine in the&s;e Ca&s;es for particular Chri&s;tians; becau&s;e it is not within their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI> We have &s;een before how their Authority is limited, and what is the Bound of Submi&s;&s;ion from particular Chri&s;tians. As they are CHRIST'S Officers, they have Authority to teach Men his Mind in Things pertaining to his Kingdom.&mdash;So they have no Authority to teach Men any Thing but the Mind and Will of CHRIST. It is a Truth that &s;hines with a Meridian Brightne&s;s, that whatever is not contained in a <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> is out of it and excluded by it; and the teaching <HI>his Laws only</HI> being contained in the Commi&s;&s;ion, what is not his Law is out of it and by that Commi&s;&s;ion they are excluded from teaching it, or forbid by it. The Power then of determining in the&s;e Ca&s;es before us, mu&s;t lie with <HI>every di&s;tinct wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;em|bly;</HI> I don't mean exclu&s;ive of their <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> but with him And this I think is evident from the Right of private Judg|ment that every Chri&s;tian has in Matters of Religion. We have &s;een evidently that the <HI>&s;acred Scriptures</HI> are the Rule of Faith and Practice to every Chri&s;tian; from thence each one is bound to learn what that Wor&s;hip is which Chri&s;t requires from him, and in what Manner be is to perform it: And therein is every one to be per&s;waded in his own Mind. In all the Wor&s;hip he pays to GOD he is bound to act <HI>under&s;tandingly,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="005520_0020_10184CC302154788">
which he can't be &s;aid to do if he does not under&s;tand for him&s;elf, and perform it in &s;uch a Manner as he judges mo&s;t agreeable to the Mind of Chri&s;t, and &s;o mo&s;t acceptable to him. If another Per&s;on &s;ees for him, it will be but a blind Service that he will yield. <HI>Every one mu&s;t give Account of him|&s;elf to GOD,</HI> to whom alone as his only Ma&s;ter he is to &s;tand or fall: And it will be but a poor Account the <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> will have to give of all his <HI>ceremonious Wor&s;hip,</HI> that the <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> directed him &s;o.&mdash;How much farther will it go in that Day to &s;ay, the <HI>King,</HI> or <HI>Parliament,</HI> or <HI>Convocation</HI> directed me to pay &s;uch or &s;uch a Kind of Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>But <HI>the la&s;t Thing</HI> included in this <HI>Corollary</HI> is, that <HI>civil Rulers</HI> have no Authority to determine for Chri&s;tians the <HI>Form of Church Government:</HI> and that for the Rea&s;ons before given, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Becau&s;e this would be going be&s;ide the <HI>End</HI> of civil Go|vernment, and becau&s;e this is already done by Chri&s;t. If his <HI>Word</HI> be a compleat <HI>Rule</HI> of Faith and Practice to the Chri&s;|tian; it &s;urely contains &s;ufficient In&s;truction in the Nature of a Church; what Kinds of Officers Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted, what their Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s is; what the Rights and Priviledges of the Church are, and on what Terms to be enjoyed; what the Di&s;cipline thereof is, and how it is to be admini&s;tred. For that which is the Rule of Faith and Practice to a Chri&s;tian (as he is a Subject of Chri&s;t) mu&s;t certainly be the Mea&s;ure of his Faith and Practice: For that certainly cannot be the Mea&s;ure of his Faith and Practice which contains any Thing more or le&s;s than he ought to believe and practice. Chri&s;t is the Head of his Church, a King in his own Kingdom; a Part of who&s;e Royalty it is to give <HI>Laws</HI> to his Subjects; the&s;e are contained in the <HI>&s;acred Scriptures,</HI> which are open to all for the learning and under&s;tanding of them. And &s;o far are Men from having any Power of in&s;tituting or forming a Church for Chri&s;t, that it is their greate&s;t Honour to be <HI>Servants</HI> in the Hou&s;e of GOD. <HI>Heb.</HI> 3. 5. This being Truth, that Chri&s;t has &s;hown us what his Will is touching the ordering of his Hou&s;e in the &s;acred Scriptures; it then follows, that none either <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> can have any Authority to pre&s;cribe to Chri&s;tians how it &s;hall be order'd, to form the Model or any Part of it.</P>
<P>II. The next <HI>Corollary</HI> I &s;hall deduce from the Principles before laid down, is, That the <HI>ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">il</HI> Authority have no Power to e&s;tabli&s;h any Religion (<HI>i. e.</HI> any Profe&s;&s;ions of Faith, Modes of Wor&s;hip, or Church Government) of a human Form and

Compo&s;ition, as a <HI>Rule</HI> binding to Chri&s;tians; much le&s;s may they do this on any <HI>Penalties</HI> what&s;oever.&mdash;Religion mu&s;t remain on that Foot where Chri&s;t has placed it. He has fully declared his Mind as to what Chri&s;tians are to believe and do in all re|ligious Matters: And that <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>private Judgment</HI> belong|ing to every Chri&s;tian evidenced in the preceeding Pages, ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es it is every one's Duty, Priviledge and Right to <HI>&s;earch the &s;acred Writings</HI> as Chri&s;t has bid him, and know and judge for him&s;elf what the Mind and Will of his only Lord and Ma&s;ter is in the&s;e Matters.&mdash;It does, I think, from hence follow, that no Order of Men have any Right to e&s;ta|bli&s;h any Mode of Wor&s;hip, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as a Rule binding to parti|cular Chri&s;tians. For if they may, then Chri&s;tians are abridg'd or rather &s;triped of their Right, which is to involve our &s;elves in a Contradiction. For if <HI>A</HI> has a Right to <HI>judge</HI> for him&s;elf what his Ma&s;ter's Will is, then <HI>B</HI> can have no Right to im|po&s;e his own Sentiments concerning that Ma&s;ter's Will as a Rule for <HI>A.</HI>&mdash;For to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>A</HI> has a Right, which <HI>B</HI> has a Right to take from him, is to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>A</HI> has no Right at all; which is a direct Incon&s;i&s;tency. And to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>B</HI> in &s;uch Ca&s;e has a Right to <HI>puni&s;h</HI> A for not receiving his E&s;tabli&s;hment, is but to increa&s;e the Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>But here you will &s;ay, <Q>Tho' they have no Authority to e&s;tabli&s;h a Religion of their own devi&s;ing, yet have they not Authority to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> a <HI>pure Religion</HI> drawn out of the &s;acred Scriptures, either by them&s;elves or &s;ome &s;ynodical A&s;&s;em|blies, and oblige their Subjects upon (at lea&s;t) <HI>negative Pe|nalties</HI> to receive the &s;ame.</Q>&mdash;This I &s;hall endeavour fairly to con&s;ider when I have ob&s;erved, that if by the Word <HI>E&s;tabli&s;h</HI> be meant only an <HI>Approbation</HI> of certain Articles of Faith and Modes of Wor&s;hip, of Government, or <HI>Recommendation</HI> of them to their Subjects: I am not arguing again&s;t it. But to carry the Notion of a <HI>religious E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> &s;o far as to make it a Rule binding to the Subjects, or on any <HI>Penalties</HI> what&s;o|ever, &s;eems to me to be oppre&s;&s;ive of Chri&s;tianity, to break in upon the &s;acred Rights of Con&s;cience, and the common Rights and Priviledges of all good Subjects.&mdash;For let it be &s;uppo&s;ed as now pleaded, that the Clergy or a &s;ynodical A&s;&s;embly draw up the Articles and Form of Religion, agreeable in their Judg|ment to the &s;acred Scriptures, and the Reception of the &s;ame be made <HI>binding</HI> by the civil Authority on their Subjects;&mdash;It will then follow, That <HI>all &s;uch E&s;tabli&s;hments</HI> are <HI>certainly
<PB N="20" REF="005520_0022_10184CC758514BC8">
right</HI> and <HI>agreeable to the &s;acred Scriptures.</HI> For it is impo&s;&s;ible to be true that any can have Right or Authority to oblige Chri&s;tians to believe or practice any thing in Religion <HI>not true</HI> or <HI>not agreeable</HI> to the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD: Becau&s;e that would de|&s;troy the <HI>&s;acred Scriptures</HI> from being the <HI>only Rule</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> in <HI>Religion</HI> to a Chri&s;tian. If the &s;acred Scriptures are his Rule of Faith and Practice, he is oblig'd and that by GOD him&s;elf, to believe and practice accordingly. No Man therefore, or Order of Men can have any Right or Power to oblige the Chri&s;tian to believe or do any Thing in Religion contrary to, or different from, what GOD has obliged him: The Po&s;ition of the one is the Removal of the other. This then is certain, that if this Propo&s;ition be true, that a humane religious E&s;tabli&s;hment is a Rule <HI>binding</HI> to Chri&s;tians, or that the civil Authority have Power to oblige their Subjects to re|ceive them;&mdash;then they <HI>are always right</HI> and <HI>agreeable to</HI> GOD'S <HI>Word;</HI> but the latter is not true;&mdash;therefore the Pro|po&s;ition is fal&s;e. Humane E&s;tabli&s;hments in Matters of Reli|gion, carry in them no Force or Evidence of Truth. They who make them are no Ways exempt from humane Frailties and Imperfections: They are as liable to Error and Mi&s;take, to Prejudice and Pa&s;&s;ion, as any others. And that they have erred in their Determinations, and decreed and e&s;tabli&s;hed Light to be Darkne&s;s, &amp; Darkne&s;s to be Light, that they have per|plexed the Con&s;ciences of Men, and corrupted the Simplicity of the Faith in CHRIST, many Councils and Synods and A&s;|&s;emblies of State are a notorious Proof. King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th's <HI>Parliament</HI> and <HI>Convocation,</HI> who e&s;tabli&s;hed the famous <HI>&s;ix bloody Articles of Religion</HI> in the Year 1540, had as much Right or Power to make a religious E&s;tabli&s;hment <HI>binding</HI> to the Sub|jects, as any <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Parliament &s;ince.</HI> If therefore the <HI>civil Authority</HI> has a Power to make a religious E&s;tabli&s;hment <HI>bind|ing</HI> to the Subjects; <HI>tho&s;e &s;ix Articles</HI> were <HI>true,</HI> tho' they con|tained abominable Ab&s;urdities, and amazing Fal&s;hoods; and the People were obliged to believe them, and tho&s;e who &s;uffered for di&s;believing them &s;uffered ju&s;tly.&mdash;</P>
<P>Perhaps you will here &s;ay; <Q>Altho' they have no Authority to make an E&s;tabli&s;hment <HI>contrary</HI> to Scripture; yet why may they not have Authority to make an E&s;tabli&s;hment <HI>agre|able</HI> to the Scriptures, that &s;hall be a <HI>binding</HI> Rule to Chri&s;|tians, without the Suppo&s;ition or that Propo&s;ition's being liable to &s;uch an Inference from it (which I have made)

<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That then their <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hments</HI> are <HI>certainly right</HI> and <HI>agreeable to Scripture,</HI> or in other Words that they who make them mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be ve&s;ted with <HI>Infallibility.</HI></Q>&mdash;I will give then a Rea&s;on, if what already &s;aid does not &s;atisfy.&mdash;Let us then have but a clear and determinate Idea of the Subject we are &s;peaking of; and I think you will find the Con|clu&s;ion certain. This religious E&s;tabli&s;hment that has this binding Force in it,&mdash;is either in the <HI>very Words</HI> of the <HI>Scrip|tures</HI> them&s;elves; or in <HI>Propo&s;itions formed by this Body of Men</HI> we are &s;peaking of, which in their Judgment contain the true <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and Meaning of the Scripture.&mdash;There can be no other Sen&s;e put upon it.&mdash;The <HI>former</HI> of the&s;e can't be meant; for that is the Scripture it &s;elf which I am pleading is the alone Rule in the Ca&s;e before us: Be&s;ides 'tis a Vanity to talk of Mortals making the Con&s;titutions of GOD ALMIGHTY to become a binding Rule to Chri&s;tians. So that the Point before us comes to this Propo&s;ition, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That the <HI>civil Authority</HI> have Power to make &s;uch a religious E&s;tabli&s;hment which <HI>they think</HI> is agree|able to Scripture, a <HI>binding</HI> Rule to Chri&s;tians.&mdash;Then it follows, that what <HI>they think</HI> to be the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> of the Scriptures, is the Rule for the Chri&s;tian: for that what they <HI>&s;o lay down</HI> for the Sen&s;e of the Scriptures &s;hould be a Rule <HI>binding</HI> to Chri&s;tians, and that yet what <HI>they think</HI> is the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and Mean|ing of the Scripture, is <HI>not the Rule</HI> for a Chri&s;tian, is a Con|tradiction.&mdash;It follows al&s;o, that what <HI>they think</HI> to be the true <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> of Scripture, is <HI>certainly</HI> the <HI>true Sen&s;e</HI> of it:&mdash;For to &s;uppo&s;e, that what <HI>they lay down</HI> for the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and Meaning of the &s;acred Scriptures, is a <HI>binding Rule</HI> to Chri&s;tians, and that yet the &s;ame is <HI>not the true Sen&s;e</HI> of Scripture, is a Contradic|tion; unle&s;s that Propo&s;ition be fal&s;e, that the <HI>&s;acred Scriptures</HI> are the <HI>alone Rule</HI> of Faith and Practice to a Chri&s;tian, which is a &s;acred Maxim with every true Prote&s;tant. So that if a religious E&s;tabli&s;hment which <HI>they think</HI> to be agreeable to Scripture is a binding Rule to a Chri&s;tian; it is the true Sen&s;e of Scripture, and the Suppo&s;al that they are ve&s;ted with Au|thority to make their religious E&s;tabli&s;hments a binding Rule to a Chri&s;tian, does nece&s;&s;arily infer their being inve&s;ted with <HI>Infallibility</HI> too.&mdash;Again&mdash;to &s;uppo&s;e any Thing <HI>not agree|able</HI> to the &s;acred Scriptures can be a binding Rule in Matters of Religion to a Chri&s;tian is what no Chri&s;tian will a&s;&s;ert; becau&s;e it de&s;troys the Chri&s;tian's only Rule in Matters of Re|ligion. The &s;acred Scriptures alone (or what is agreeable

<P>The other Text <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 1. no doubt relates to <HI>civil Powers:</HI>&mdash;A Text often wrecked and tortured by &s;uch Wits as were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve the De&s;igns of arbitrary Power, of erecting a civil Tyranny over a free People, and as often wre&s;|ted out of their Hands by the Force of Truth.

As this Text does not &s;hew they have &s;uch a Power, the Pretence of Obedience being due to them by this Text, if they &s;hould be &s;o vain as to fancy they have it, is a meer Va|nity. The Truth of the Ca&s;e is plainly this;&mdash;That this Text &s;hews Obedience is due to civil Rulers in tho&s;e Ca&s;es wherein they <HI>have Power</HI> to command, and does not call for it any farther: And when rightly under&s;tood affords not a Shadow of an Argument, of Obedience being due to them when they claim a Power in Matters of Religion which does not belong to them.&mdash;It appears indeed plainly, (tho' I need not &s;pend Time upon it, in order to &s;how no Argument can be drawn from this Text in Favour of what it is now brought for, unle&s;s it be fir&s;t proved from &s;ome other Text or Topick, that the civil Magi&s;trate's Power does extend to the making any religious or eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hment a Rule binding to a Chri&s;tian, which never can be done, the contrary thereof being already demon&s;trated) I &s;ay it appears from what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays in the 3<HI>d</HI> and 4<HI>th</HI> Ver&s;es, that their <HI>Power</HI> is a <HI>limited</HI> one: and therefore the <HI>Obedience</HI> due is a <HI>limited</HI> Obe|dience.&mdash;<HI>Salus Populi e&s;t Lex Suprema,</HI> is the Apo&s;tle's Maxim; for he is expre&s;s that the <HI>End</HI> of all humane Autho|rity is the Good of the Publick.&mdash;That therefore &s;ets the Bounds to civil Authority, as &s;uch, on the one Side, and fixes the Bounds of Obedience on the other.&mdash;The Ground of Obedience cannot be extended beyond the Ground of that Authority to which Obedience is required.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, no Obedience is here required to be given but to <HI>&s;uch Power</HI> as is <HI>from</HI> GOD: Until therefore it be &s;hown that the civil Magi&s;trate has Power from GOD to make any &s;uch religious E&s;tabli&s;hment (of which we are &s;peaking) a Rule binding to Chri&s;tians; this Text is in vain pre&s;&s;ed into the Service of &s;uch as plead for any Obedience due to &s;uch an E&s;ta|bli&s;hment.&mdash;It mu&s;t lie on them who plead this Obedience is due from Chri&s;tians,&mdash;to prove that GOD has ve&s;ted them with this Power.

&s;etting up &s;uch a Rule is a grand Ab&s;urdity. Now I have &s;hown evidently before, that the <HI>civil Magi&s;trate</HI> can have no &s;uch Power, that his Power relates to the <HI>civil Intere&s;ts</HI> of a People, and is bounded thereby&mdash;that the <HI>&s;acred Scriptures</HI> are the alone Rule of Faith and Practice in Religion to a Chri&s;tian; that the Right of private Judgment, what the Chri&s;tian is to believe and do in Religion according to that Rule, is his na|tural and unalienable Right; &s;o that he neither really may nor can give up his Soul, his Con&s;cience in the&s;e Matters to the Controul of human Laws. And the Truth is, the civil Ma|gi&s;trate is &s;o far from having a rightful Power in the&s;e Ca&s;es, to make Laws for CHRIST'S Subjects; that in doing &s;o, he violates the fundamental Priviledge of the Go&s;pel, the Birth|right of Believers, Chri&s;tian Liberty. 2 Cor. 3. 17. <HI>Where the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of the</HI> LORD <HI>is, there is Liberty,</HI> Gal. 4. 31. <HI>We are no, Children of the Bondwoman, but of the Free.</HI> It is impo&s;|&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that GOD by his &s;pecial Grace in the Go&s;pel &s;hould free us from the Bondage of Ceremonies, his own Com|mandments, in the&s;e Things, and &s;ubject us to a more grevi|ous Yoke, the Commandments of Men.&mdash;Nor has he given us this Gift only as a &s;pecial Priviledge and Excellence of the free Go&s;pel above the &s;ervile Law; but has &s;trictly commanded us to keep and enjoy it.&mdash;<HI>You are called to Liberty,</HI> Gal. 5. 13.&mdash;1 Cor. 7. 23. <HI>Be not ye the Servants of Men,</HI> Gal. 5. 1. <HI>Stand fa&s;t in the Liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free.</HI> A Command accompany'd with the weightie&s;t Rea&s;ons. Rom. 14. 9. 10. <HI>For to this End</HI> CHRIST <HI>both died and ro&s;e and revived, that he might be LORD, both of the Dead and Living. But why do&s;t thou judge thy Brother,</HI> &amp;c. How pre&s;ume&s;t thou to be <HI>his Lord?</HI> To be who&s;e <HI>only Lord,</HI> at lea&s;t in the&s;e Things, CHRIST both died and ro&s;e and lived again&mdash;<HI>We &s;hall all &s;tand before the Judgment Seat of</HI> CHRIST. Why pretend you then to be <HI>a Lord, a Judge,</HI> in the&s;e Things, for which we are to be accountable to the Tribunal of CHRIST only, our Lord and Lawgiver?

By all which I think it is evident, that for Men to exerci&s;e &s;uch a Power in religious Matters as you have been pleading for, is not only a Violation of the Rights of Chri&s;tians, who&s;e Souls in Matters of Religion are S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">one but CHRIST and his Laws; but an Inva|&s;ion

of the royal Power of CHRIST, who is the &s;ole Legi&s;lator in his own Kingdom.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate and clear this Point, let me bring it down to a plain and familiar In&s;tance. Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed a humane Law is made, that <HI>the Sign of a Cro&s;s</HI> &s;hall be made upon a Per&s;on's Forehead, after the U&s;e of Water <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI>&mdash;&s;o that none &s;hall be admitted to Bapti&s;m but who &s;ubmit to this Manner of Admini&s;tration of it: or a Law requiring all who attend the Ordinance of the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> to do it in a <HI>kneel|ing Po&s;ture:</HI> and let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that there is no particular Law to the contrary in the Go&s;pel forbidding tho&s;e Actions. Now according to the Rule you plead for, (on the Suppo&s;ition now made,) Chri&s;tians are bound to obey the&s;e Laws. Now the contrary is evident. For it has been already demon&s;trated, that every Chri&s;tian has a Right to adhere to the <HI>&s;acred Scrip|tures</HI> as the only Rule of his Faith and Practice in Religion; and that the Right of private Judgment, what he is to believe and do in Religion according to that Rule, is really unaliena|ble: he can't therefore be bound to yield any Obedience to &s;uch Laws of Man, unle&s;s he be obliged to yield up an unaliena|ble Right, which is a Contradiction. Be&s;ides&mdash;If the making &s;uch Laws are an Inva&s;ion of CHRIST'S Authority; how is it po&s;&s;ible the Propo&s;ition &s;hould be true, that a Chri&s;tian is obliged to obey them, unle&s;s the Chri&s;tian has two Ma&s;ters in Religion, contrary to <HI>Mat.</HI> 23. 8, 9, 10.&mdash;Where there is no Authority to command in Matters of Religion, there a Chri&s;tian is under no Obligation from &s;uch Laws to obey: But in the Ca&s;e before us, &s;uch Laws are not only enjoined without Authority, but they interfere with CHRIST'S Autho|rity: So that a Chri&s;tian is indeed very far from being bound to obey them.</P>
<P>Unto what has been already &s;aid that will &s;hew this, I &s;hall add but a few Words. CHRIST has in the <HI>Go&s;pel Charter</HI> made a Grant of certain <HI>Privileges</HI> to tho&s;e who would be, and do approve them&s;elves his Subjects.&mdash;To them he has granted the Privilege of attending on him in the <HI>Ordinances</HI> he has in|&s;tituted, for the conveying the &s;anctifying Graces of his SPIRIT to their Souls, to prepare them for the Inheritance he has pur|cha&s;ed and &s;ecured by Promi&s;e to &s;uch as believe in and obey him.&mdash;As this is clear and certain in the Nature of the Thing it &s;elf, that the <HI>Grantor</HI> of a <HI>Privilege</HI> has the &s;ole Right of fix|ing the <HI>Condition</HI> on which the Privilege &s;hall be enjoyed by the
<PB N="35" REF="005520_0037_10184CF23AFC8E30">
<HI>Grantee;</HI> &s;o it is equally certain, that if any other attempts in the lea&s;t Mea&s;ure to alter the <HI>Condition</HI> on which &s;uch <HI>Privi|lege</HI> is to be enjoyed by the Grant, he does therein <HI>invade</HI> the indi&s;putable Right of the Grantor. Now in the Ca&s;e before us&mdash;there can't be a clearer Truth, than&mdash;that this is Chri&s;t's &s;ole Prerogative to make the Grant and fix the <HI>Conditions</HI> on which the <HI>Privileges</HI> are to be enjoyed, and that this is done in the Go&s;pel Charter. The <HI>Privileges</HI> are <HI>granted</HI> on the <HI>Condi|tions</HI> that are written in the Charter. The Privileges are not granted on certain Conditions to be invented by Men after the making of the Charter:&mdash;For that would &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>in|finite Wi&s;dom</HI> has granted certain Privileges to Chri&s;tians on &s;uch <HI>Conditions</HI> as <HI>humane Weakne&s;s</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hes; and that Chri&s;t &s;trips him&s;elf of his Royalty to cloath a mere Creature with it, and makes the Creature the Director of his Beque&s;ts: To &s;uppo&s;e which of Chri&s;t is to di&s;honour him with a Witne&s;s. It is indeed the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity imaginable, to &s;uppo&s;e this Matter could be &s;ettled by any other than Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who makes the Grant: And the <HI>Conditions</HI> lie as plainly in the Grant as the Privileges conveyed by it; That he who believes and obeys the Go&s;pel, has the Right to the Enjoyment of the Privileges belonging to a Subject of Chri&s;t.&mdash;This then being certain, that Chri&s;t has fixed the <HI>Conditions</HI> of Chri&s;tians enjoy|ing the Privileges, the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel;&mdash;it is equally certain, that Man and every Order of Men are exclu|ded by Chri&s;t him&s;elf from any Authority in this Matter: So that if any Man or Order of Men make any Alteration in tho&s;e Conditions, or make any new ones; they do it not only without Authority, but again&s;t it, and therein controul Chri&s;t's Authority. To apply this then to the Ca&s;e before us:&mdash;Since the making the <HI>above-mentioned Figure</HI> on the Per&s;on to be bap|tized, or &s;uch a particular <HI>bodily Po&s;ture</HI> at the Reception of the Lord's Supper, are not fixed by Chri&s;t as the <HI>Conditions</HI> of Chri&s;tians enjoying the&s;e <HI>Ordinances,</HI> or by any Law of Chri&s;t made nece&s;&s;ary in order to the Ob&s;ervance of the&s;e In&s;titutions of his; for <HI>Man</HI> to make them <HI>Conditions,</HI> without a Com|pliance with which Chri&s;tians may not have the Enjoyment of tho&s;e <HI>Ordinances,</HI> is not only to act without Authority, but is a&s;&s;uming an Authority which only belongs to Chri&s;t: it being a practical Declaration that Chri&s;t's Subjects <HI>&s;hall not enjoy</HI> the <HI>Privileges</HI> of the Go&s;pel upon the <HI>Conditions</HI> fixed in Chri&s;t's Grant&punc; Which is therefore evidently an <HI>Inva&s;ion</HI> of Chri&s;t's

kingly Office, and an evident Violation of the Rights of Chri&s;|tians. So that it is certain, Chri&s;tians are not only, not bound to &s;ubmit to &s;uch human Laws, but do truly profe&s;s their Ad|herence to CHRIST'S Authority, when they refu&s;e to do &s;o.</P>
<P>But if you &s;ay here; <Q>altho' the Rule you have been plead|ing for will not hold;&mdash;yet if every Thing relating to De|cency and Order in divine Wor&s;hip be not particularly de|termined by CHRIST, why may not what is referrible thereto fall under the Determination of the Laws of the <HI>civil Au|thority,</HI> and be warranted by that apo&s;tolical Precept, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 40. <HI>Let all Things be done decently and in Order;</HI> and &s;o <HI>tho&s;e particular In&s;tances</HI> I have mentioned be ju&s;tly warrant|ed by that Precept? If &s;ome body mu&s;t determine in &s;uch Ca&s;es, why may not the civil Rulers do it?</Q> I an&s;wer&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. If Chri&s;tians keep from <HI>Indecency</HI> and <HI>Di&s;order</HI> in their Wor&s;hip, they come up to the Rule given by the Apo&s;tle in the now mentioned Text; and this they may certainly do without the civil Magi&s;trate's determining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Thing about it.

So that it is impo&s;&s;ible to get an Inference from this Text in Favour of the civil Authority's determining any thing by their Laws in the&s;e Ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. If by what you would call <HI>Decency</HI> or <HI>Order</HI> in Wor&s;hip be meant, either any Act or Mode of Wor&s;hip, or any Cere|mony that has any Religion at all placed in it; then I &s;ay, no Man or Order of Men has the lea&s;t Authority to invent or in|join any &s;uch Thing: This would fall under our SAVIOUR'S Condemnation in <HI>Mark</HI> 7. 7.</P>
<P N="3">3. Any &s;uch Modes or Circum&s;tances of divine Wor&s;hip which are &s;uppo&s;ed in this Objection left undetermined by Chri&s;t, may not be determined by any legal Injunctions of the civil Authority. And that&mdash;</P>

(2.) The Suppo&s;ition that &s;uch Modes or Circum&s;tances of divine Wor&s;hip may be determined by human Laws, does al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e that the civil Authority may fix <HI>Terms</HI> of <HI>Communion</HI> for Chri&s;tians: What is thus &s;uppo&s;ed enacted by a Legi&s;la|ture, is made a Rule of Action to the Subject by the very Sup|po&s;ition of its being made a Law; &s;o that in this Ca&s;e the Sub|ject is to attend divine Wor&s;hip, but according to a human Law; and is therefore <HI>excluded</HI> from the Benefit of divine Wor&s;hip and Ordinances, in Ca&s;e of a non-compliance with that human Injunction. This is the true State of the Matter with Re&s;pect to <HI>tho&s;e In&s;tances</HI> I have ju&s;t mentioned: And any the like Modes of Wor&s;hip enjoined on Chri&s;tians by the Laws of Men, they are made the <HI>Terms</HI> of <HI>Communion</HI> to Chri&s;tians, the <HI>Conditions</HI> of their enjoying the external Privileges of Chri&s;|tians: And for Men to fix any <HI>Terms</HI> of <HI>Communion</HI> for Chri&s;|tians in this Manner, to make that <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to their Enjoy|ment of the Privileges CHRIST has purcha&s;ed for them which he has not made nece&s;&s;ary, has been already demon&s;trated an Inva&s;ion of CHRIST'S kingly Authority.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The civil Authority may not determine &s;uch Modes and Circum&s;tances of Wor&s;hip by legal Injunctions; becau&s;e this would interfere with the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>private Judgment</HI> that belongs to Chri&s;tians. The <HI>&s;acred Scriptures</HI> are &s;ufficient to furni&s;h the Chri&s;tian unto every good Work; they hold forth &s;ufficient Light about the Modes and Circum&s;tances of divine Wor&s;hip, which in this Objection are &s;uppo&s;ed to be left unde|termined by CHRIST. And it is the Duty and Right of Chri&s;|tians to learn from thence, and judge concerning their Duty in the&s;e as well as more important Matters of Religion; and &s;uch Determinations of them are lawful and warrantable as are according to the general Rules of Scripture given to direct us herein. And therefore there may be various Modes of per|forming the &s;ame religious Duties that are each allowable and lawful: tho' &s;ome particular Circum&s;tances may make one more expedient to &s;ome Per&s;ons than the other, and the&s;e al&s;o may be varied by the Providence of GOD. It is the Right therefore of Chri&s;tians, of every wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;embly, to de|termine for them&s;elves the&s;e Modes and Circum&s;tances of Wor&s;hip, as I have before ob&s;erved.

Since God has formed the Under&s;tand|ings of Men &s;o different, with re&s;pect to Clearne&s;s, Strength, and Compa&s;s, and placed them in &s;uch very different Circum|&s;tances; a Difference of Sentiments in &s;ome Things in Reli|gion, &s;eems natural and unavoidable: and to &s;uppo&s;e this does in its own Nature tend to the public Mi&s;chief of the State, &s;eems little le&s;s then arraigning infinite Wi&s;dom. From thence will ari&s;e greater Rea&s;on and Scope for mutual For|bearance and Chri&s;tian Charity. But it will certainly be found on Reflection, that it has no ill A&s;pect on the civil State. Have we not known Per&s;ons of different Sentiments and Prac|tices in religious Matters, as <HI>Pre&s;byterians, Congregationali&s;ts, Church-Men</HI> (as commonly called) <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Quakers,</HI> all living in the &s;ame Community in Quiet and Peace with one another?

To pretend that &s;uch as own the &s;acred <HI>Scriptures</HI> to be the alone Rule of Faith and Practice in Religion, can't live in Peace and Love as good Neighbours and good Subjects, tho' their Opinions and Practices in religious Matters be different, is both fal&s;e in Fact, and a vile Reproach ca&s;t upon the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> which breaths nothing but <HI>Benelovence</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> among Men: and while it plainly teaches the Right of private Judgment in every one, it mo&s;t forcibly enjoins the Duties of mutual <HI>Forbearance</HI> and <HI>Charity.</HI> That golden Precept of our ble&s;&s;ed LORD: <HI>What&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them,</HI> Math. 7. 12, well taught and enforced by the Teachers of the Go&s;|pel, would (if I may u&s;e the Word) infinitely more tend to make Chri&s;tians of the &s;everal Denominations in the State, good Neighbours and good Subjects, then this whim&s;ical

Notion of Uniformity. Which if it had always had its due Force on the Minds of Men, we &s;hould never have heard of the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of Uniformity in Religion to the Peace of the State, nor any &s;uch legal E&s;tabli&s;hment of Religion I have been impleading. That Precept being a &s;acred Guard to the una|lienable Rights of Con&s;cience, which are always invaded by &s;uch E&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P>But if you &s;ay, <Q>that <HI>different Sects</HI> in Religion aiming at Superiority, and endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s each other, form contrary Factions in the State; which tends to di&s;tre&s;s and thwart the civil Admini&s;tration.</Q>&mdash;I an&s;wer; The civil Authority's protecting all in their ju&s;t Rights, and particularly this ine&s;timable and unalienable one, <HI>the Right of private Judg|ment</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> is the be&s;t Guard again&s;t the Evil &s;uppo&s;ed in the Objection. Be&s;ides, this is no more a <HI>natural Con&s;equence</HI> of Men's thinking differently in Religion, than of different Judgments about <HI>Wit,</HI> or <HI>Poetry, Trade,</HI> or <HI>Hu&s;|bandry.</HI></P>
<P>Or if you farther &s;uppo&s;e, <Q>that <HI>Religion</HI> is a Matter of much greater Importance than the&s;e Things, and demands therefore a more warm and active Zeal.</Q> Be it &s;o; No|thing farther follows from thence, than that we &s;hould endea|vour to &s;upport its Honour in a Way &s;uited to its Excellency; to in&s;truct one another in its grand Principles and Duties, and recommend it by calm and &s;trong Per&s;wa&s;ion.&mdash;It is by <HI>Truth</HI> CHRIST'S Kingdom is &s;et up, as he him&s;elf has taught us, <HI>Luke</HI> 18. 37.

be drawn again&s;t every Body's having the <HI>Bible</HI> from &s;uch Pre|mi&s;es; &s;o in the Ca&s;e before us, no Conclu&s;ion again&s;t the <HI>Right of private Judgment</HI> for our &s;elves in Matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> can be drawn from the&s;e Inconveniencies; which do not &s;pring directly from it, but ari&s;e entirely from different Cau&s;es; from <HI>Pride,</HI> or fooli&s;h <HI>Bigotry,</HI> that either does not under&s;tand, or pays no Regard to the unalienable Rights of Con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="3">3. Such legal E&s;tabli&s;hments have a direct <HI>contrary</HI> Ten|dency to the <HI>Peace</HI> of a Chri&s;tian State. As the <HI>Exerci&s;e of private Rea&s;on,</HI> and free Enquiry in a &s;trict and con&s;tant Ad|herence to the &s;acred <HI>Scriptures</HI> as the only Rule of Faith and Practice, is the mo&s;t likely Means to produce Uniformity in the e&s;&s;ential Principles of Chri&s;tianity as well as Practice; &s;o this is certainly the mo&s;t &s;ure Method of procuring Peace in the State. No Man having any Rea&s;on to repine at his Neigh|bour's Enjoyment of that Right, which he is not willing to be without him&s;elf; and on the &s;ame Grounds he challenges it for him&s;elf, he mu&s;t be forced to own, that it is as rea&s;onable his Neighbour &s;hould enjoy it. But then on the other Hand, <HI>every Claim of Power</HI> incon&s;i&s;tent with this Right, (as the mak|ing &s;uch a human E&s;tabli&s;hment of Religion of which we are &s;peaking) is an <HI>Encroachment</HI> on the Chri&s;tian's Liberty; and &s;o far therefore he is in a State of <HI>Slavery:</HI> And &s;o far as a Man feels him&s;elf in a State of Slavery, &s;o far he feels him&s;elf unhappy, and has Rea&s;on to complain of that Admini&s;tration which puts the Chain upon him. So that if <HI>Slavery</HI> be for the <HI>Peace</HI> of the civil State; then &s;uch E&s;tabli&s;hments as we are &s;peaking of, tend to promote the Peace of the State: <HI>i. e.</HI> what makes the Subjects <HI>mi&s;erable,</HI> really makes them <HI>happy.</HI> And as it nece&s;&s;arily tends to the Mi&s;ery of &s;ome, &s;o it al&s;o promotes <HI>Bigotry, Pride,</HI> and <HI>Ambition</HI> in &s;uch as are fond of &s;uch E&s;ta|bli&s;hments: which have from Time to Time broken out in Extravagancies and Severities (upon good Subjects) in Men of Authority and Influence, and into Rage and Fury, Hatred and Obloquy, and &s;uch like Wickedne&s;&s;es, in the impotent and commoner Sort. This has been the Ca&s;e in all Places, more or le&s;s, as well as in our own Nation. Thus when K. <HI>Henry</HI> threw off the <HI>Popi&s;h Tyranny,</HI> he would not de&s;troy and put an End to the Exerci&s;e of that unju&s;t Power, but only transferred it to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and exerci&s;ed it with great Severity. The &s;ame unju&s;t Dominion over the Con&s;ciences of Men was again ex|erci&s;ed in the Reign of <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> who (tho' otherwi&s;e a wi&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="005520_0045_10184D08C5A68880">
Prince&s;s) yet being of an high and arbitrary Temper, pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Uniformity</HI> with Violence; and found Bi&s;hops enough, <HI>Parker, Aylmer, Whitgift</HI> and <HI>others,</HI> to cheri&s;h that Temper, and pro|mote &s;uch Mea&s;ures. <HI>Silencings, Deprivations, Impri&s;onments, Fines</HI> &amp;c. upon the Account of Religion, were &s;ome of the powerful <HI>Rea&s;onings</HI> of tho&s;e Times. The Cries of innocent Pri&s;oners, widowed Wives, and &s;tarving Children, made no Impre&s;&s;ion on their Hearts: Piety and Learning with them were void of Merit: Refu&s;al of Sub&s;criptions, and Non-con|formity, were Crimes never to be forgiven. At the In&s;tiga|tion of that per&s;ecuting Prelate <HI>Whitgift,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Can|terbury,</HI> the <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion Court</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;hed; which had a near Re&s;emblance to the <HI>Court of Inqui&s;ition:</HI> (A fine Inven|tion to promote Uniformity) Which by the Cruelties practiced in it in the <HI>two following Reigns,</HI> was render'd the Abhorrence of the Nation; &s;o that it was di&s;&s;olved by <HI>Parliament,</HI> with a <HI>Clau&s;e,</HI> that <HI>no &s;uch Court &s;hould be erected for the future.</HI> A Creature framed to promote the wretched De&s;igns of &s;uch Per|&s;ecutors, was her weak Succe&s;&s;or <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, who gave the <HI>Puritans</HI> to under&s;tand&mdash;<HI>That if they did not conform, he would either hurry them out of the Kingdom, or el&s;e do wor&s;e.</HI> The Bi&s;hops &s;upported by &s;uch an <HI>in&s;pired King,</HI> according to <HI>Whitgift'</HI>s impious and fordid Flattery, pur&s;ued the Maxim to accompli&s;h Uniformity by Per&s;ecution. The grievous Seve|rities and numerous Violences exerci&s;ed on Non-conformi&s;ts in <HI>that</HI> and the <HI>next</HI> Reign, under that tyrannical Prelate <HI>Laud,</HI> (&s;aid in Parliament by Sir <HI>Harbottle Grim&s;tone,</HI> to be <HI>the great and common Enemy of all Goodne&s;s and good Men</HI>) are well known by all truly acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times: As well as the cruel Inju&s;tice exerci&s;ed <HI>after the Re&s;toration</HI> on great Numbers of as good Subjects as any in the Nation; meerly becau&s;e they could not come up to this <HI>Uniformity</HI> pleaded for, and enquired according to their Mea&s;ure of Know|ledge after the Truth, and de&s;ired to wor&s;hip GOD according to their Con&s;ciences: until the late great Deliverer (WILLIAM the IIId. of happy Memory) of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation from <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> freed tho&s;e mi&s;erable Sufferers (noble Confe&s;&s;ors for the Truth) from a Yoke of Bondage laid upon them, and gave them <HI>a Law</HI> for the Security of their <HI>Chri&s;tian Liberty;</HI> this <HI>Right of private Judgment</HI> I have been pleading for. And that this has promoted <HI>Peace</HI> in the State, Experience &s;ince has proved; as well as former Experience made it mo&s;t evident,
<PB N="44" REF="005520_0046_10184D0BC912C8D0">
that the Incroachments upon this Right of private Judgment, by &s;uch legal E&s;tabli&s;hments, have been exceeding prejudicial to the Peace of the State: It being impo&s;&s;ible but that &s;uch Methods &s;hould cau&s;e and perpetuate Schi&s;ms and Divi&s;ions of the Church, and di&s;turb and di&s;quiet the State; &s;ince <HI>the Wrath of Man cannot work the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> GOD; and &s;ince civil Puni&s;hments have no Tendency to convince the <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> but only to inflame the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> again&s;t the Advi&s;ers and Inflicters of them. And as Hi&s;tory gives us &s;o dreadful an Account of the melancholy and tragical Effects of this Practice, one would think, that no People who have any Regard for the Peace of the Flock of CHRIST, who know the Worth of Liberty, would be fond of &s;uch legal E&s;tabli&s;hments, or any &s;uch Me|thods as encroach upon Chri&s;tian Liberty, the mo&s;t valuable of all our Rights.</P>
<P>Thus I think I have fully an&s;wered all your <HI>Objections</HI> again&s;t my <HI>&s;econd Corollary.</HI> I therefore proceed to a <HI>third.</HI></P>
<P>III. That the <HI>civil Authority</HI> ought to <HI>protect all their Subjects</HI> in the Enjoyment of <HI>this Right of private Judgment</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>wor&s;hipping</HI> GOD according to their <HI>Con&s;ciences.</HI> That being the <HI>End</HI> of civil Government (as we have &s;een) <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the greater Security of Enjoyment of what belongs to every one, and <HI>this Right of private Judg|ment,</HI> and <HI>wor&s;hipping</HI> GOD according to their <HI>Con&s;ciences,</HI> be|ing the <HI>natural and unalienable Right</HI> of <HI>every Men,</HI> what Men by entering into civil Society neither did, nor could give up into the Hands of the Community; it is but a ju&s;t Con&s;e|quence, that they are to be <HI>protected</HI> in the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of <HI>this Right</HI> as well as any other. A wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;embly of Chri&s;tians have &s;urely as much Right to be <HI>protected</HI> from Mo|le&s;tation in their Wor&s;hip, as the Inhabitants of a Town a&s;&s;em|bled to con&s;ult their civil Intere&s;ts from Di&s;turbance <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Right I am &s;peaking of, is the mo&s;t valuable Right, of which every one ought to be mo&s;t tender, of univer&s;al and equal Concernment to all; and <HI>Security</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI> in the En|joyment of it the ju&s;t Expectation of every Individual. And the civil Magi&s;trate in endeavouring and doing this, mo&s;t truly comes up to the Character of a <HI>nur&s;ing Father</HI> to the Church of CHRIST. If this had been <HI>protected</HI> as it ought to have been, what infinite Mi&s;chief to the Chri&s;tian Church had been prevented? From the Want of a due Care of this, the <HI>Clergy</HI> through Pride and Ambition a&s;&s;umed the Power of pre&s;cribing
<PB N="45" REF="005520_0047_10184D0D795E7E30">
to, impo&s;ing on and domineering over the Con&s;ciences of Men; civil Rulers for their own private Ends helping it for|ward; which went on 'till it produced the mo&s;t dete&s;table <HI>Mon&s;ter</HI> the Earth ever had upon it, the <HI>Pope,</HI> who has de|luged the Earth with the Blood of Chri&s;tians. This being the true Spirit of <HI>Popery,</HI> to impo&s;e their Determinations on all within their Power by any Methods which may appear mo&s;t effectual: and tho&s;e <HI>civil Magi&s;trates</HI> that &s;uffered and help|ed that <HI>Bea&s;t</HI> to invade this Right, did therein <HI>commit Forni|cation with her, and give her their Strength and Power;</HI> and &s;o in&s;tead of proving <HI>Fathers</HI> to their People, proved the cur&s;ed <HI>Butchers</HI> of them. It has been by a&s;&s;erting and u&s;ing this Right, that any of the <HI>Nations</HI> who <HI>have been drunk with the Wine of her Fornication,</HI> have <HI>come out from her Abominations:</HI> and would the civil Magi&s;trates of tho&s;e Nations, who at this Day wor&s;hip the Bea&s;t, but protect their Subjects in <HI>this na|tural Right</HI> of <HI>every one's judging for him&s;elf in Matters of Re|ligion,</HI> according to that alone Rule the <HI>Bible;</HI> that &s;ettled Darkne&s;s of Ignorance, Error &amp; Idolatry, which now involves them, would vani&s;h as the Darkne&s;s of the Night does by the ri&s;ing of the Sun. How un&s;peakably would the Advantages be, ari&s;ing from the Protection of this Right, did they reach no further than to the E&s;tates, Bodies, and Lives of Men?</P>
<P>All <HI>Reformations</HI> are built on this &s;ingle Principle I have been pleading for, from which we &s;hould never depart: yet it mu&s;t be owned and de&s;erves to be lamented, that the Reformed have too much departed from this Principle upon which they at fir&s;t &s;et up; whence it has come to pa&s;s that Reformations in one Place and another have not been more perfect. For the Prince of Darkne&s;s has always found Means this Way to make a Stand again&s;t the mo&s;t vigorous Efforts; and if any Advantages have been gained in any Point, to &s;ecure a &s;afe Retreat, by infatuating Men with that &s;trange Sort of Pride, whereby they a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves only, but allow to none el&s;e, a Power of domineering over the Con&s;ciences of others. Religion will certainly lie under Oppre&s;&s;ion if this unju&s;t Au|thority be transferred, to <HI>Decrees of Councils, Convocations, In|junctions of civil Magi&s;trates,</HI> or from one Man or any Order of Men to another; as it is if we have any other Rule of Faith and Practice in Religion, be&s;ides the <HI>Bible.</HI> It were ea&s;y to enlarge on the va&s;t Advantages and Happine&s;s of ad|mitting no other Rule or Guide but the &s;acred <HI>Scriptures</HI> only:
<PB N="46" REF="005520_0048_10184D11518B2660">
thence would flow the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings to Mankind, Peace and Happine&s;s to the World: &s;o that if there be any Rights and Liberties of Men that challenge <HI>Protection</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> therein from the civil Magi&s;trate, it is <HI>this natural Right</HI> of <HI>private Judgment in Matters of Religion,</HI> that the &s;acred <HI>Scrip|tures only may become the Rule to all Men in all religious Matters,</HI> as they ought to be. In a Word, this is the &s;ure&s;t Way for the Ea&s;e and Quiet of Rulers, as well as Peace of the State, the &s;ure&s;t Way to engage the Love and Obedience of all the Subjects. And if there be divers religious Sects in the State, and the one attempts to offend the other, and the Magi&s;trate interpo&s;es only to keep the Peace; it is but a natural Con&s;e|quence to &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;that in &s;uch Ca&s;e they all finding them|&s;elves equally <HI>&s;afe,</HI> and <HI>protected</HI> in their Rights by the civil Power, they will all be equally obedient. It is the Power given to one, to oppre&s;s the other, that has occa&s;ioned all the Di&s;turbances about Religion. And &s;hould the Clergy clo&s;ely adhere to the&s;e Principles, in&s;tead of their being reproached for Pride and Ambition, as the Sowers of Strife and Conten|tion and Di&s;turbance of the Peace of the Church of God; they would be honoured for their Work's &s;ake, e&s;teemed for their Character, loved as Ble&s;&s;ings to the World, heard with Plea&s;ure, and become &s;ucce&s;sful in their Endeavours to recom|mend the Knowledge and Practice of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>IV. It al&s;o follows from the preceeding Principles, that <HI>every Chri&s;tian</HI> has <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>determine</HI> for him&s;elf <HI>what Church to join him&s;elf to;</HI> and <HI>every Church</HI> has <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>judge</HI> in <HI>what Manner</HI> GOD is to be <HI>wor&s;hipped</HI> by them, and <HI>what Form of Di&s;cipline</HI> ought to be ob&s;erved by them, and the <HI>Right</HI> al&s;o of <HI>electing their own Officers.</HI> (For Brevity Sake I put them all together) From this <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>private Judgment</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated in the foregoing Pages, it follows, that no Chri&s;tian is obliged to join him&s;elf to <HI>this</HI> or <HI>the other Church,</HI> becau&s;e any Man or Order of Men command him to do &s;o, or becau&s;e they tell him the Wor&s;hip and Di&s;ci|pline thereof is mo&s;t con&s;onant to the &s;acred Scriptures; For no Man has Right to judge for him, whether the Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline of <HI>this</HI> or <HI>the other</HI> Church be mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;acred Scriptures; and therefore no other can have Right to de|termine for him to which he ought to join him&s;elf: This Right therefore mu&s;t lie with every Chri&s;tian. As this is the Right of each <HI>Individual;</HI> &s;o al&s;o of a <HI>Number</HI> of them agreeing in
<PB N="47" REF="005520_0049_10184D1441C5FAC0">
their Sentiments in the&s;e Things, to agree to ob&s;erve the Or|dinances of Chri&s;t together, for their mutual Edification ac|cording to the Rules of the Go&s;pel, which makes a particular Chri&s;tian Church. And having voluntarily agreed together for &s;uch an End, no Man or Order of Men has any Authority to pre&s;cribe to them, <HI>the Manner</HI> of their <HI>wor&s;hipping</HI> GOD, or enjoining any <HI>Form of Church Di&s;cipline</HI> upon them. So a <HI>Number of &s;uch Churches</HI> (who are all endowed with Equality of Power) have Right to judge for them&s;elves, whether it be mo&s;t agreeable to the Mind of CHRIST, to <HI>con&s;ociate</HI> together in any <HI>particular Form;</HI> as far In&s;tance, of <HI>Pre&s;byteries,</HI> or <HI>Synods,</HI> or the like. And if they &s;hould do &s;o, &s;uch Agreements of their's cannot be made a binding Rule to them, by any Law of Man; As has been demon&s;trated in the preceeding Pages. The&s;e Churches are all of them as free to think and judge for them&s;elves, as they were before &s;uch Agreement; their Right of private Judgment not being given up, but re&s;erved entire for them&s;elves, when they entered into any &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed A|greement. And if on Experience of &s;uch a Method of Regi|men as they have agreed to, and farther Light, they judge any of them, there is good Rea&s;on for them to forbear practi&s;ing farther in that Form; they are not held to continue therein, but have Right to act according to their pre&s;ent Light; they having no other Rule but the &s;acred <HI>Scripture,</HI> they have al|ways a Right to act their Judgment according to that Rule. So al&s;o if a greater or le&s;&s;er <HI>Number</HI> of Chri&s;tians in any parti|cular Church, &s;hall judge another Way of Wor&s;hip, or Me|thod of Di&s;cipline, more agreeable to the <HI>Mind</HI> of CHRIST, than what is practi&s;ed in that Church; they have <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>with|draw,</HI> and to be <HI>embodied</HI> by them&s;elves. As they ought to &s;ignify this De&s;ire to their <HI>Brethren,</HI> &s;o <HI>they</HI> ought to <HI>con&s;ent&punc;</HI> for they can have no Right to hold them to them&s;elves: and this without any Breach of Charity on either Side; or of after Communion, &s;o long as they held to CHRIST the Head, and are agreed in the great <HI>E&s;&s;entials</HI> of Chri&s;tianity. So al&s;o from the &s;ame Premi&s;&s;es it follows, that every Church or wor&s;hip|ping A&s;&s;embly has the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>choo&s;ing its own Officers:</HI>&mdash;Tho' it may ordinarily be a Point of Prudence for a Church de&s;titute of a Pa&s;tor, to con&s;ult Pa&s;tors of other Churches where they may be &s;upplied with a Per&s;on &s;uitable for that Office; yet that no Way &s;uppo&s;es, the full <HI>Power of Election</HI> does not lie with the Church. It is for the <HI>better improving</HI> their <HI>Power of
<PB N="48" REF="005520_0050_10184D4B0A065090">
Election,</HI> that &s;uch a Method is ever to be taken, and not be|cau&s;e they have not the Power of Election in them&s;elves. Nor can they be bound to this, if they &s;ee good Rea&s;on to act other|wi&s;e, (as the Ca&s;e has &s;ometimes hapned and often may.) <HI>Nor can they be at all bound</HI> to <HI>elect</HI> the <HI>Per&s;on recommended:</HI> They are to prove him them&s;elves, and be fully &s;atisfied in his Mini&s;|terial Gifts and Qualifications, and may herein be controuled by no Power whatever. It is their own good, their everla&s;t|ing Intere&s;t that is concerned, and if they judge his Doctrine not agreeable to the &s;acred Scriptures, that he is not qualified as he ought to be for a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter they have Right to reject him. As they have a Right of judging the Doctrines taught them them by the &s;acred Scriptures, and of rejecting the &s;ame if not agreeable thereto, &s;o it nece&s;&s;arily follows they have equal Right to refu&s;e &s;uch a one for their Teacher, who does not teach according to the Scriptures.</P>
<P>But if it be demanded how this Power can be exerci&s;ed, mu&s;t every Individual be agreed in the Per&s;on, or no Election made?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. Such a univer&s;al Agreement is not nece&s;&s;ary, the Election may be made by a Majority. Experience has &s;hewn where the Candidate has had the Go&s;pel Qualifications for the Office, the Concurrence in the Choice has been univer&s;al, at lea&s;t &s;o general as to bring no Difficulty in the Exerci&s;e of this Right. So when there has been any con&s;iderable Number who judged they had any weighty Rea&s;on again&s;t the Election made by a Majority, Experience has al&s;o &s;hewn the Majority's denying them&s;elves of that Choice, and trying farther, has i&s;&s;ued hap|pily for the whole. In &s;uch Ca&s;es, 'tis certain, <HI>Wi&s;dom if profitable to direct.</HI> And that Rule of our Saviour's, <HI>Math.</HI> 7. 12. will go a great Way in keeping Churches in the peaceable Exerci&s;e of this Right.</P>
<P N="2">2. Where a minor Part cannot in Judgment acquie&s;ce in the Choice made by the major Part of the wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;em|bly, they have a Right to withdraw and choo&s;e a Mini&s;ter for them&s;elves, or if not able to &s;upport one may attend divine Wor&s;hip in a neighbouring Church, where they find they may do it to greater Edification. They are all equally ve&s;ted in the &s;ame Right, and hold it independent one of another, and each one independent of the whole, or of all the re&s;t. So that the greater Number can have no Right to impo&s;e a Mini&s;ter on the le&s;&s;er. It is not here as in civil Societies where the
<PB N="49" REF="005520_0051_10184D160C3E79C8">
Right of each Individual is &s;ubjected to the Body, or &s;o trans|ferred to the Society, as that the Act of the Majority is legally to be con&s;idered as the Act of the whole, and binding to each Individual. As to what concerns Men's civil Intere&s;ts, there is nothing in the Nature of Things to hinder or prevent its being lawful or be&s;t, &s;o to transfer their Power to the Com|munity. But it is not &s;o in religious Matters, where Con&s;ci|ence and Men's eternal Intere&s;ts are concerned. If the Power of acting be transferred in this Ca&s;e, as in that of civil Societies (now mentioned) Thus, if for In&s;tance, the Majority &s;hould elect an <HI>Arminian</HI> Teacher, the minor Part mu&s;t be &s;o con|cluded by that Choice, as to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a One as their Teacher, when at the &s;ame Time it may be directly again&s;t their Con&s;ciences to receive &s;uch Doctrines or &s;uch a Teacher. But &s;ince the Rights of Con&s;cience may not be touched, the Right of electing a Teacher is not transfer'd to the Body by the Individuals, as civil Rights may be in civil Societies. That Principle or Suppo&s;ition, which any Ways infer, an Infringe|ment upon the Rights of Con&s;cience, cannot be true; as that does, which &s;uppo&s;es a Majority may impo&s;e a Mini&s;ter on a le&s;&s;er Part.</P>
<P>If to avoid what I have a&s;&s;erted, that in &s;uch Ca&s;e a minor Part may withdraw and choo&s;e a Mini&s;ter for them&s;elves, it be here &s;aid&mdash;That they may remove their Habitations&mdash;</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, Since this Right of electing a Teacher for them|&s;elves does truly remain with them, after the Choice made by the Majority, that Right may be exerci&s;ed by them, and why not in one Part of the civil State as well as another? They are guilty of no Crime for which they &s;hould be bani&s;hed by the State, nor of any Thing whereby they have forfeited a Right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their pre&s;ent Freeholds: their Right to their Freeholds remains, and con&s;equently their Right to exerci&s;e their Chri&s;tian Rights where they be, and have a Right to remain.&mdash;It is to no Purpo&s;e here to &s;ay, Perhaps the Le|gi&s;lature has fixed the Bounds of the Pari&s;h.&mdash;For the Le|gi&s;lature can make civil Societies, and may fix the Bounds of Towns and Pari&s;hes for civil Purpo&s;es; yet they can't make Churches, nor may they make any Laws that interfere with the Rights of Chri&s;tians.&mdash;Nor is it to any Purpo&s;e to &s;ay, This would open a Door to a great Multiplication of Churches: For how many populous Places, as well as <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> have tried it, and found Religion and Peace be&s;t promoted on the&s;e Princi|ples;
<PB N="50" REF="005520_0052_10184D1B878429F0">
nor is there a probability that Churches will by this Means be increa&s;ed beyond their Ability to &s;upport their Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>By what I have &s;aid you will find &s;ome other of your Que|ries an&s;wer'd, without my making particular Application, and therefore I leave that for you to do at your own Lei&s;ure: And &s;hould here fini&s;h my Letter, but that you in&s;i&s;t on my giving you my Sentiments on a Law made in your Colony <HI>May</HI> 1742, Intitled <HI>An Act for regulating Abu&s;es, and correcting Di&s;orders in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs:</HI> Which it &s;eems, thro' the fond Opi|nion &s;ome Per&s;ons among you had of it, was thru&s;t into one of our publick News Papers, &s;oon after it was pa&s;&s;ed; under which every wi&s;e By-&s;tander, that was a hearty Friend to your civil and religious Intere&s;ts, was ready to write, <HI>Tell it not in Gath</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not de&s;cend into every Particular that might be of|fered upon it&mdash;Some few Remarks may &s;uffice.</P>
<P>I. The Law is founded on this fal&s;e Principle, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That the civil Authority hath Power to e&s;tabli&s;h a Form of Church-Government by penal Laws. The Act relates wholly to Mat|ters of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Nature: and as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uppo&s;es, the civil Ma|gi&s;trate has Authority by penal Laws to regulate eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters, &s;o con&s;equently to e&s;tabli&s;h an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titu|tion by penal Laws. It appears from the Preamble to the Act, that the declared De&s;ign of it is to keep Per&s;ons from deviating from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, in the Year 1708 and that under the Penalties by this Law enacted.&mdash;But that they have no &s;uch Authority, has been fully demon&s;trated in the foregoing Pages, which I need not repeat. Whence it mu&s;t follow, that the Act is fundamentally wrong, being made with|out any Authority. Be pleas'd to reflect one Minute on this Power challenged by this Law, to correct, and that by penal Laws, &s;uch Di&s;orders as are purely of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Nature, and &s;ee the Con&s;equence of it. One Di&s;order to be corrected is, A Mini&s;ter's preaching out of his own Pari&s;h unde&s;ired by the Mini&s;ter and major Part of the Church where he &s;hall &s;o preach. If the civil Magi&s;trate has this Power the Act &s;up|po&s;es, if he judges it to be a Di&s;order for the Mini&s;ter to preach in his own Pari&s;h on a Week Day, he may then re&s;train him: or if he t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ks it a Di&s;order that there &s;hould be any public Prayers but by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ted Form, he may then re&s;train all to &s;uch a Form. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the civil Magi&s;trate has Authority to cor|rect
<PB N="51" REF="005520_0053_10184D1E6662C840">
eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;orders, he has a Right to judge what is a Di&s;order in the Church, and re&s;train the &s;ame. If he may exe|cute this in one In&s;tance, he may in another: and every Thing is on this Principle liable to be di&s;allowed in the Wor&s;hip of God, which does not &s;uit with the civil Magi&s;trate's Opinion. Whatever he judges to be a Di&s;order, is &s;o by this Principle, and may be re&s;trained accordingly. And &s;o farewell all Chri&s;tian Liberty.&mdash;It &s;ignifies nothing to &s;ay, your civil Magi&s;trates are &s;o &s;ound in the Faith, there's no Danger they will go &s;o far. I hope &s;o indeed with you; tho' you can't tell what tho&s;e or others in &s;ucceeding Times may do. It is no new Thing for civil Authority to make dreadful Havock of the Liberties and Religion of Chri&s;tians; but the Argument, you &s;ee, proceeds upon the Nature of Things. The Principle, that Law &s;tands upon, you may plainly &s;ee, is directly incon&s;i&s;tent in its own Na|ture, with the unalienable Rights of Chri&s;tians. What &s;ad Effects have been felt in our own Nation, in &s;ome former Reigns, from this very Principle's being put in Practice; who at all ac|quainted with Hi&s;tory can be ignorant? While they were exe|cuting what they were plea&s;ed to call whol&s;ome Severities on <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> they were only in their Judgment correcting Di&s;|orders in eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs. If this Power belongs to the civil Authority, as &s;uch, it mu&s;t belong to tho&s;e in one State as well as another; and is as ju&s;tly challenged by the civil Au|thority in <HI>France,</HI> as in <HI>New-England.</HI> Let it be but once &s;up|po&s;ed the civil Magi&s;trate has this Authority, where can you &s;top? what is there in Religion not &s;ubjected to his Judgment? All mu&s;t be Di&s;order in Religion, which he is plea&s;ed to call &s;o; you can have no more of the external Part of Religion than he is plea&s;ed to leave you, and may have &s;o much of Super&s;tition as he is plea&s;ed to enjoin under the Head of Order. So that this Law &s;tands on no better a Foundation, than what infers the De&s;truction of Chri&s;tian Liberty.</P>
<P>Having made this general Ob&s;ervation, I go on, to con&s;ider the fir&s;t Paragraph, which runs thus&mdash;<Q>That if any ordained Mini&s;ter or other Per&s;on licen&s;ed as afore&s;aid to preach, &s;hall enter into any Pari&s;h not immediately under his Charge, and &s;hall there preach or exhort the People, he &s;hall be denied and &s;ecluded the Benefit of any Law of this Colony made for the Support and Encouragement of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try; except &s;uch ordained Mini&s;ter or licen&s;ed Per&s;on &s;hall be expre&s;ly invited and de&s;ired &s;o to enter into &s;uch other Pa|ri&s;h,
<PB N="52" REF="005520_0054_10184D211F24ABE8">
and there to preach and exhort the People, either by the &s;ettled Mini&s;ter, and the major Part of the Church of &s;aid Pari&s;h; or in Ca&s;e there be no &s;ettled Mini&s;ter, then by the Church or Society in &s;aid Pari&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>The Mini&s;ter's heretofore &s;uppo&s;ed Right to have A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Help from his Brethren in the Mini&s;try by preaching, is hereby cut off. None may preach unle&s;s the major Part of the Church de&s;ire it; tho' the Mini&s;ter and one Half of the Church and all the re&s;t of the Congregation, which make up much the greater Part of the Number, who have Right to hear the Word preached, are ever &s;o de&s;irous of hearing the Word from another, and apprehen&s;ive (as the Ca&s;e may be) of the great Nece&s;&s;ity of it. Before this Law was pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;hould have pre&s;umed, there was not one Mini&s;ter on the Continent, but what thought he had good Right to invite any orthodox Mini&s;ter to preach in his Pulpit: not only Mini&s;ters, but Churches in every Part of the World, have &s;o &s;uppo&s;ed and practi&s;ed. But it &s;eems by this Law this Suppo&s;ition is a Mi&s;|take, and the Practice a Di&s;order in the Church.&mdash;Yet if the Mini&s;ter has no &s;uch Right, how comes it to pa&s;s, that the greater Part of his Hearers are cut off from any Right to hear &s;uch as may be ever &s;o well qualified to in&s;truct. The Non|communicants, which perhaps makes three Quarters of the Pari&s;h, are in one Part of this Paragraph con&s;ider'd as a Cypher, and in another Part as having full Right to hear whom they de&s;ire, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>In a Pari&s;h where they have no &s;ettled Mini&s;ter.</HI> In &s;uch Ca&s;e, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, by this Law, they have Right to hear any Mini&s;ter they de&s;ire, tho' not one Church-Member join with them in the De&s;ire; for they may make up a Majority of the Society without one Communicant with them.&mdash;Yet if the Day before, while the Mini&s;ter of &s;uch a Pari&s;h was living, it &s;eems, if the &s;ame Per&s;ons had been de&s;irous of hearing the &s;ame Man, they are by this Law cut off the Privilege; if the Mini&s;ter's De|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e too had been joined with them, it would have helped no|thing: or rather (in &s;hort) as this Law &s;tands, this very Circum|&s;tance of their having a Mini&s;ter extingui&s;hes their Right of hearing &s;uch Preachers as they de&s;ire. Such now being the plain Sen&s;e of this Paragraph; I &s;ay then,&mdash;</P>
<P>II. That it is apparently incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, deprives Mini&s;ters and particular Chri&s;tians of their Rights and Li|berties, and inve&s;ts a lordly Power in a &s;mall Part of a Pari&s;h-Society, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t or one Half of a Church, over a wor|&s;hipping
<PB N="53" REF="005520_0055_10184D22C8ACC788">
A&s;&s;embly, &s;ince they never had nor can have any rightful Power to hinder other Chri&s;tians in the Pari&s;h from hearing &s;uch Mini&s;ters as they judge may promote their &s;piri|tual Good, as by this Law they are enabled to do.</P>
<P>III. It inve&s;ts an exorbitant Power in Mini&s;ters over a Church and Congregation. This may look very &s;trange, e&s;pe|cially when you reflect, that by the Preamble to this Law the Mini&s;ters are repre&s;ented as having departed from the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline, and been guilty of di&s;orderly and irregular Practices; and therefore are &s;uch Per&s;ons as are not fit to be left to conduct them&s;elves, in their mini&s;terial Office, nor to be governed by their own eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;ti|tution, but mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be laid under &s;ome extraordinary legal Re&s;traints. I &s;ay, they are thus plainly repre&s;ented (whe|ther truly, or not, is not the Que&s;tion) by the Preamble; yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, they are by this Law ve&s;ted with an ex|orbitant Power over the Churches. Chri&s;tians, it &s;eems, mu&s;t be &s;trip'd of an invaluable Branch of Liberty Chri&s;t has ve&s;ted them with, &amp; the &s;ame mu&s;t be lodged in that Order of Men, who are repre&s;ented as unfaithful in the Execution of their Tru&s;t. For by this Law every Mini&s;ter has not only Power given him, to prevent any other Min&s;ter's preaching in his Pari&s;h, not only if a &s;mall Number de&s;ire it, but if the whole wor&s;hipping A&s;|&s;embly de&s;ire it; not only in the Pulpit, but in any private Hou&s;e, which is directly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Rights of Chri&s;|tians: but al&s;o in Ca&s;e a Pari&s;h be under a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ettling another Mini&s;ter thro' the Incumbent's Di&s;ability to di&s;charge his Pa&s;toral Office, it is put into his Power to negative any Choice they &s;hall make of a Mini&s;ter, and &s;o Churches are really &s;tript of their Right of electing their own Mini&s;ters. It is plain by the Words of the Law, none can preach in the Pari&s;h without the &s;ettled Mini&s;ter's Con&s;ent: &amp; if one preaches to Day by his Leave, and the whole wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;embly de|&s;ire his continued preaching, he has it in his Power by this Law to prevent his preaching To-morrow. And therefore if a Church can call and &s;ettle none (in &s;uch a Ca&s;e) but whom their pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor plea&s;es, (as is certainly the Ca&s;e by this Law) the Right of electing their Mini&s;ter is taken from them. A &s;uppo&s;ed Right in <HI>A,</HI> dependent on the Will of <HI>B,</HI> is no Right at all.&mdash;And this, as I have heard, is the Ca&s;e of one Church on <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, now groaning under this Oppre&s;|&s;ion, which may al&s;o prove the Ca&s;e of any, or of all other
<PB N="54" REF="005520_0056_10184D26D3C9E718">
Churches in that Colony, if they remain under the Mi&s;ery of &s;uch a Law.</P>
<P>IV. The Per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be criminal by this Law, are &s;ubjected to an unrea&s;onable Puni&s;hment, and this too without any Trial in the Law, in any Form whatever. The &s;uppo&s;ed Crime is a Mini&s;ter or licen&s;ed Candidate's preaching in a Pari&s;h where the Incumbent and major Part of the Church have not invited: <HI>i.e.</HI> If the Incumbent has invited with one Half of the Church and three Quarters of the whole Pari&s;h, or if the whole Church and Pari&s;h invite, and not the Incumbent, or if there is not more than Half of the Church, or more than Half of the Society, where there is no Incumbent; each of the&s;e is &s;uch a Crime for which the Puni&s;hment is, <HI>The De|nial and Seclu&s;ion from the Benefit of any Law of the Colony made for the Support and Encouragement of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try.</HI> Now I find by looking into your Colony Law-Book, the Laws made for the afore&s;aid Purpo&s;e may be &s;um'd up in the&s;e few Words, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <Q>That all Agreements made by the Inhabitants of a Society or the major Part of them a&s;&s;embled in a Society-Meeting, re&s;pecting the Settlement and Maintenance of the Mini&s;ter they have cho&s;en, &s;hall be binding to all the Inha|bitants of &s;uch Society, and to their Succe&s;&s;ors; which Sums or Payments &s;o agreed to &s;hall be levied and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the &s;everal Inhabitants in &s;uch Society, according to their re&s;pective E&s;tates from Time to Time, as they &s;hall be &s;et in the general Li&s;t; which Sums or Payments &s;hall be gathered by &s;uch Per&s;on &s;aid Society &s;hall appoint to be the Collector of them, who is to repa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o an A&s;&s;i&s;tant or Ju&s;tice of the Peace for a Warrant to enable him to collect the Rate.</Q> Now then, as by the preceeding Laws, &s;uch Agree|ments are made binding to the Inhabitants of a Society and their Succe&s;&s;ors &amp;c. hence to be denied and &s;ecluded the Benefit of any Law made for the Support and Encouragement of the Go&s;|pel Mini&s;try, includes in it the being denied and &s;ecluded the Benefit of holding the Society to &s;uch Agreements; and &s;o this Law plainly intends, by prohibiting any A&s;&s;i&s;tant or Ju&s;tice of the Peace, to &s;ign any Warrant for collecting a Rate where a Mini&s;ter has been certified again&s;t, as having acted contrary to this Law. So that, in &s;hort, the Puni&s;hment is the Depri|cation of his Livelihood; and thence forward he may beg his Bread. This appears unrea&s;onable, to inflict &s;o heavy a Puni&s;h|ment for preaching in &s;uch Ca&s;es as abovementioned, when
<PB N="55" REF="005520_0057_10184D29825824B8">
(as it may happen) it might be evidently Duty &s;o to do. But let the Preaching be at the De&s;ire of more or fewer, &s;till it is no Im|morality: it is but an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;order, even in the Ac|count of this Law, which &s;urely can't de&s;erve &s;o &s;evere a Penalty. Many gro&s;s Immoralities have a much le&s;s Puni&s;h|ment a&s;&s;igned for them, than this heretofore &s;uppo&s;ed innocent Action of preaching the Go&s;pel. If the civil Peace was bro|ken by it, I can't &s;ee how &s;o &s;evere a Puni&s;hment for it can be ju&s;tified. But it is evident, the civil Peace is not broken by this &s;uppo&s;ed Crime, which is nothing but preaching the Go&s;pel; which is &s;o far from breaking the Peace, or tending thereto, that it intirely tends to make Men better, and &s;o better Sub|jects. The preaching out of his own Pari&s;h does not alter the Nature of the Action, nor is the natural Tendency of the Word changed thereby; no Man's civil Property or Intere&s;t is at all invaded by it; and how &s;uch an Action can be puni&s;hed at all, appears my&s;terious to me! It is not for preaching Sedition or Trea&s;on, but even the Go&s;pel of Peace, that CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters are render'd liable to be deprived of their daily Bread.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be here &s;aid,&mdash;That the&s;e Laws made for the Support of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, are to be looked upon as Acts of <HI>Favour,</HI> relative to &s;uch as comply with the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Con&s;titution of the Government; and &s;o if any Mini&s;ters will not keep within the Bounds of that Con&s;titution, they ju&s;tly forfeit &s;uch Favour; and &s;o the Puni&s;hment here is to be under&s;tood, a Declaration that their Right to &s;uch Favour now cea&s;es. I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. That Action, which by this Law is made thus criminal, is not contrary to, but well con&s;i&s;tent with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution, under which the&s;e Mini&s;ters are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ettle. It is not incon&s;i&s;tent with that eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution, for any Mini&s;ter to preach in any other Pari&s;h than his own to any Number of Chri&s;tians on their De&s;ire at any of their private religious Exerci&s;es.&mdash;But I will only In&s;tance in one Particular made thus Criminal by this Act, which is warranted by that eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution, and the con&s;tant Practice of the Churches. The Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip is given at every Ordination, in which the Mini&s;ters and Churches con|cerned, do &s;olemnly promi&s;e to e&s;teem and treat the Per&s;on ordained as a duly authorized Mini&s;ter of CHRIST, and to be ready on all Occa&s;ions to own him as &s;uch, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t him

in his Work: In Con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;olemn Promi&s;es, Mini&s;ters &amp; Churches have looked upon them&s;elves under &s;uch Obligations to each other, that if one of the&s;e Mini&s;ters judges he has real Need of A&s;&s;i&s;tance in preaching, from ano|ther (where the&s;e mutual Obligations take Place) he has Right to a&s;k it, tho' the Church does not join with him in it, and the Church's &s;o hearing him preach they have always judged (and therein they have judged truly) is acting but agre|able to tho&s;e previous Obligations they have laid them&s;elves under to him, to treat him as an authorized Mini&s;ter of CHRIST, and to hold Communion with him as &s;uch; one Way of doing which, is certainly hearing the Word from him. So that it is plain, one Mini&s;ter's preaching for ano|ther upon his De&s;ire, tho' the Church joins not in it, is at lea&s;t well con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution</HI> (and I need &s;ay no more of it in this Argument) under which the&s;e Mini&s;ters are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ettle, according to the Objection: and therefore no <HI>Forfeiture</HI> is made, by &s;uch an Action, of the Benefit of the <HI>Laws</HI> made in Favour of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution.&mdash;They have Right to this Benefit &s;o long (at lea&s;t) as they act <HI>con&s;i&s;tently</HI> with that eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution under which they &s;ettled.&mdash;The <HI>Act,</HI> di&s;allow'd by this Law, and for which they are deprived of this Benefit, <HI>is con&s;i&s;tent</HI> with that Con&s;titution.&mdash;In this Manner therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> deprive them of it, is to take it away while their Right to it in Equity remains good. This, you &s;ee, I have &s;aid on the Suppo&s;ition, tho&s;e Laws are to be con&s;idered only as <HI>Acts of Grace,</HI> as laid in the Objection. But then I &s;ay in the next Place&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Laws</HI> here referred to, made for the Support of the <HI>Go&s;pel Mini&s;try,</HI> are <HI>not</HI> Acts of <HI>Grace;</HI> they are no other than what the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> tho't them&s;elves <HI>obliged</HI> to make. If the civil Authority of a State are obliged to take Care for the Support of Religion, or in other Words, of Schools and the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, in order to their approving them&s;elves <HI>nur|&s;ings Fathers,</HI> (as, I &s;uppo&s;e, every Body will own, and there|fore I &s;hall not &s;pend any Time in proving it) then the Law e&s;pecially referred to is <HI>not an Act of Grace.</HI> It was what the Legi&s;lature judged mo&s;t ju&s;t, ea&s;y, and equal for the People, &s;afe and ea&s;y for the Mini&s;ter, who is to give him&s;elf wholly to his Work; or in a Word, be&s;t for the People and the Mini&s;ter, that Contracts &s;hould be &s;o made, &s;o binding and &s;o performed; for both People and Mini&s;ter are concerned in
<PB N="57" REF="005520_0059_10184D2E16582378">
the Act. I don't &s;ay, the Legi&s;lature could not have provid|ed as well in &s;ome other Way: this is no Ways nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;uppo&s;ed in the Ca&s;e. But as they were obliged to make &s;ome good Provi&s;ion in the Ca&s;e, both with re&s;pect to the People who are to pay, and the Mini&s;ter who is to receive, &s;o in their Wi&s;dom they fixed on that Method, as what was good for the whole. 'Tis therefore no more an <HI>Act of Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> than any Act of the Legi&s;lature re&s;pecting any <HI>civil</HI> Intere&s;ts or Con|tracts of the Subject. What the <HI>public Good</HI> calls for therein, they are <HI>obliged</HI> to do: And the Acts they make in Pur&s;uance thereof are no Acts of <HI>Grace,</HI> but (&s;trictly &s;peaking) of <HI>Debt</HI> to the People. And as the Act, referred to, is not an Act of Grace, &s;o this Law brings a <HI>Puni&s;hment,</HI> not only on the Mi|ni&s;ter, as before ob&s;erved, but on the <HI>People</HI> too, by letting them loo&s;e from their <HI>Agreement</HI> with their Mini&s;ter, the now &s;uppo&s;ed Offender. For the Mini&s;ter remaining with the People, they have a <HI>new Contract</HI> to make, and mu&s;t take &s;ome <HI>other Method</HI> for performing it, than what the <HI>Law</HI> in the former Ca&s;e had provided: And from the known <HI>&s;trait-handed</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition in too many towards the Support of the Go&s;pel, it mu&s;t needs follow, that the Burden of the Support of it mu&s;t lie much more <HI>unequally</HI> upon the People, and perhaps on but a very <HI>few.</HI> As this is the certain Con&s;equence, &s;o is it a Certainty, that an <HI>innocent People</HI> are <HI>puni&s;hed,</HI> with their Mini&s;ter, by this Law.&mdash;Be&s;ides, how the letting a People loo&s;e from their &s;olemn Agreements with their Mini&s;ter, for an Action never &s;uppo&s;ed criminal before this <HI>Law</HI> was made, and is certainly no Violation of the <HI>Contract</HI> he made with them, can con&s;i&s;t with Ju&s;tice and Equity, is beyond the Ken of or|dinary Under&s;tandings: which I might have argued from as a di&s;tinct Head; but it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve it as I pa&s;s, it ly|ing now in my Way.&mdash;To return, As the <HI>Puni&s;hment is ex|traordinary,</HI> &s;o is the <HI>Manner of inflicting it extraordinary too,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>The Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h where he &s;hall &s;o offend, or the civil Authority or any two of the Committee of &s;uch Pari&s;h, &s;ending an Information thereof in Writing under their Hands to the Clerk of the Pari&s;h where &s;uch offending Mini&s;ter does belong,</HI> this does the Bu&s;ine&s;s at once, as appears by the third Paragraph in the Act.&mdash;So that meerly from the <HI>Information</HI> of <HI>one</HI> Per&s;on (as it may be) of a different Per&s;ua&s;ion in Religion, and inclined from a Party-Spirit to oppre&s;s, or one that has a per&s;onal Pre|judice again&s;t a Mini&s;ter, given to the <HI>Clerk of a Pari&s;h</HI> (whe|ther

true or fal&s;e) the Mini&s;ter is deprived of his Livelihood. Thus the Bu&s;ine&s;s is effected without any Formality of a legal Trial, or the Shadow of it. This, as I take it, is directly contrary to the Priviledges of an Engli&s;hman contained in <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> which has co&s;t our Predece&s;&s;ors Rivers of Blood to defend, and tran&s;mit down as &s;acred to their De&s;cen|dants.

<P>V. I ob&s;erve, by the &s;econd Paragraph of this Law, any <HI>A&s;&s;ociation of Mini&s;ters</HI> are &s;ubjected to the before-mentioned Penalty, <Q>That &s;hall undertake to examine or licen&s;e any Candidate for the Mini&s;try, or a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the Deci&s;ion of any Controver&s;y, or to coun&s;el and advi&s;e in any Affair that by the <HI>Say-Brook</HI> Platform is within the Province and Juri&s;diction of any other A&s;&s;ociation: Then and in &s;uch Ca&s;e <HI>every Member</HI> that &s;hall be <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> in &s;uch A&s;&s;ocia|tion &s;o licen&s;ing, deciding or coun&s;elling, &s;hall be each and every of them denied and &s;ecluded the Benefit of any Law of this Colony made for the Support and Encouragement of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try.</Q> Now this is &s;ubjecting Men to a heavy Puni&s;hment, for no Crime again&s;t the civil State, nay for Deeds in them&s;elves good, and &s;uch as may be very &s;ervice|able to the Intere&s;ts of Religion, as well as what may happen to be otherwi&s;e; for &s;o the Acts of any A&s;&s;ociation &s;ometimes may be, that are allowed of by this Law.</P>
<P>As they who drew up the Platform, tho't it would be be&s;t for the <HI>Candidates</HI> of the Mini&s;try to be <HI>examined,</HI> &s;o they no doubt tho't <HI>every A&s;&s;ociation</HI> had Men of Learning and Fidelity to do it: and if it were done by <HI>any</HI> of them, the great <HI>End</HI> propo&s;ed in &s;uch Examination would be an&s;wered. And &s;up|po&s;e the A&s;&s;ociation of <HI>New-London</HI> County &s;hould examine and licen&s;e a Candidate, that belonged to the <HI>New-Haven</HI> A&s;&s;ociation, may it not be &s;uppo&s;ed it would be as well done, and as well an&s;wer the End, as if done in <HI>New-Haven.</HI> Or if a Pari&s;h within the Di&s;trict of <HI>New-Haven</HI> A&s;&s;ociation, de&s;titute of a Mini&s;ter, &s;hould after they had tried one Candi|date and another, which they had been advi&s;ed to by the A&s;&s;o|ciation, and not &s;uited by any of them, a&s;k Advice of <HI>New-London</HI> A&s;&s;ociation, and they advi&s;e them to one within their

Limits, who they judge well qualified for the Mini&s;try, whom upon Trial they judge &s;o too, and &s;o are well &s;uited in a Mi|ni&s;ter, what Harm comes of this? or what Iniquity was there in the Act of <HI>New-London</HI> A&s;&s;ociation advi&s;ing in that Ca&s;e? How often have Churches found it needful to do &s;o, and Religion been &s;erved by it? How often have they gone out of the Colony for &s;uch Advice, and the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> advi&s;ed Churches in <HI>Connecticut</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, on their Application for it; and &s;o on the contrary, Mini&s;ters in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> advi&s;ed Churches in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts?</HI> Where lies the Difference! or was this always criminal in its own Nature! or if not, why &s;hould a whole A&s;&s;ociation of Mini&s;ters, for doing what I have above in&s;tanced in, be &s;tripped of their Livings, as it &s;eems by this Law they mu&s;t! And what is more extraordi|nary &s;till, <HI>a Mini&s;ter's meerly being</HI> pre&s;ent <HI>when it is done, ren|ders him liable to this Puni&s;hment,</HI> whether he has any Hand in it or no; nay, for ought appears, if he &s;hould prote&s;t again&s;t it, yet he e&s;capes no Part of the Penalty. The Crime, it &s;eems, is of &s;uch a Nature, that if a Man be in the &s;ame Room, tho' he prote&s;ts again&s;t the Action, he is &s;till equally faulty with the Actors: for &s;ince he is equally puni&s;hed, he mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed equally faulty. I don't imagine, you will envy any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Men the Glory of &s;uch a rare Invention.&mdash;But to fini&s;h on this Head;&mdash;Nothing is more evident, than that &s;uch an Examination or Advice, now in&s;tanced in, does not touch the civil Peace; and certainly therefore, the civil Authority go out of their Line to make this penal Law. And how near this comes to <HI>turning Judgment into Wormwood,</HI> may de&s;erve the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of &s;ome.</P>
<P>VI. The fourth Paragraph re&s;pects a licen&s;ed Candidate's or any Layman's <HI>publickly preaching and exhorting in any Pari&s;h, not de&s;ired</HI> in &s;uch Manner as expre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t Paragraph. On which I &s;hall but briefly ob&s;erve, that the Words expre&s;&s;ive of the Offence, are of &s;o loo&s;e or general Signification, as that a Per&s;on merely for religious Di&s;cour&s;e, or the mo&s;t &s;avoury Advice, &s;ea&s;onably and prudently given at any private reli|gious Meeting of Chri&s;tians, is liable to be treated as an Offender; and if I have not been mi&s;informed, there have been In&s;tances of this: However that be, there is Danger of it. Or if a Man going into any publick Hou&s;e, &s;hould hear a Company talking profanely and wickedly, and thereupon &s;eriou&s;ly lay open their Sin, and gravely advi&s;e them thereupon,
<PB N="60" REF="005520_0062_10184D36419CE720">
he would be liable to be treated as an Offender; and as the Hands may be, into which he might happen to fall, he would not e&s;cape it. But further, if it be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch Preaching and Exhorting there referred to, be a <HI>Di&s;order</HI> &s;ometimes, yet it is not <HI>always</HI> &s;o: but whenever it is &s;o (unle&s;s you &s;uppo&s;e it done to the <HI>Interruption</HI> of &s;ome <HI>lawful A&s;&s;embly</HI>) it is no Breach of the Peace, and comes not under <HI>civil</HI> Cognizance. Such di&s;orderly Per&s;ons ought to be proceeded again&s;t in an <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Manner, agreable to the Laws of CHRIST.</P>
<P>VII. I come now to the la&s;t Paragraph, which runs thus: <Q>That if any <HI>Foreigner</HI> or <HI>Stranger</HI> that is not an Inhabitant within this Colony, including as well &s;uch Per&s;ons, that have no eccle&s;ia&s;tical Character, or Licen&s;e to preach, as &s;uch as have received Ordination or Licen&s;e to preach by any A&s;&s;ociation or Pre&s;bytery, &s;hall pre&s;ume to preach, teach or publickly to exhort in any Town or Society within this Colony, without the De&s;ire and Licen&s;e of the &s;ettled Mi|ni&s;ter and the major Part of the Church of &s;uch Town or Society; or at the Call and De&s;ire of the Church and In|habitants of &s;uch Town or Society, provided that it &s;o happen that there is no &s;ettled Mini&s;ter there; that every &s;uch Teacher or Exhorter &s;hall be &s;ent (as a <HI>vagrant</HI> Per|&s;on) by Warrant from any one A&s;&s;i&s;tant or Ju&s;tice of the Peace from Con&s;table to Con&s;table, out of the Bounds of this Colony</Q>. Since which, you tell me, there has been la&s;t <HI>October</HI> an Addition made <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <Q>That who&s;o thus offends &s;hall pay the Co&s;ts of his Tran&s;portation; and if he returns again and offends in &s;uch Sort, it is made the Duty of any A&s;&s;i&s;tant or Ju&s;tice of the Peace that &s;hall be informed thereof, to cau&s;e &s;uch Per&s;on to be apprehended and brought before him, and if found guilty, to give Judgment that &s;uch Per&s;on &s;hall become bound in the penal Sum of an <HI>hundred Pounds</HI> lawful Money, to his peaceable and good Behaviour until the next County Court, in the County where the Offence &s;hall be committed, and that &s;uch Per&s;on will not offend again in like Manner; and the County Court may (if they &s;ee Cau&s;e) further bind <HI>&amp;c.</HI> during their Plea&s;ure.</Q>&mdash;Occa&s;ioned, as I am informed, by that good Gentleman Mr. <HI>Finl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y'</HI>s coming at the Direction of a <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> in the <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> Government, who had been applied to for a Mini&s;ter, and preaching to a Pre&s;byterian Church at <HI>Milford,</HI> who had join'd them&s;elves to that Pre&s;bytery, and put them|&s;elves

If the com|ing in of a Stranger and preaching in &s;uch a Manner be &s;uch a Breach of the Peace, as is puni&s;hable by the State, why &s;hould there be &s;uch <HI>Partiality?</HI> Why &s;hould Dr. <HI>Watts'</HI>s preach|ing in &s;uch Manner in <HI>Connecticut</HI> be a greater Crime, becau&s;e ordained by a <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> than any other Stranger's doing &s;o that was licen&s;ed by a Patriarch or Bi&s;hop, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;However, that is much le&s;s to be wondered at, than &s;uch Treatment as this Law &s;ubjects orthodox Mini&s;ters to, even the be&s;t Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t upon Earth, for a mere Non-conformity to a certain Point of Order, that never took Place (I &s;uppo&s;e) in any Church upon Earth.</P>

I don't men|tion this becau&s;e I would go into the Con&s;ideration of what particular Powers may be in your <HI>Charter,</HI> different from others; tho' I confe&s;s, I can't find any Words in your <HI>Charter,</HI> that expre&s;s or imply a Power to do any Thing that is pretended to be done by this Law, to e&s;tabli&s;h or regulate by Law any Matters of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Nature, to impo&s;e any civil Pains or Penalties in Matters of Con&s;cience, relating to the Wor&s;hip of God. But neither your Colony, nor any other in the King's Dominions, have any rightful Authority to do as is here &s;uppo&s;ed, according to the Que&s;tion, as I have truly &s;tated it. Let me here take a plain Ca&s;e to illu&s;trate the Point. <HI>Wickliff</HI> aro&s;e a Light in <HI>England,</HI> while Popery prevailed: be it &s;uppo&s;ed, he in&s;tructed a few in the Truth, but neither Bi&s;hop nor Incumbent of the Pari&s;h would give Leave for his preach|ing. However, he goes on preaching the Go&s;pel, and the Peo|ple will hear him. In this Ca&s;e, the King and Parliament had no rightful Authority to bani&s;h <HI>Wickliff,</HI> or turn him out from the I&s;land, for his &s;o preaching. For, as has been already &s;hewn in the preceeding Pages, <HI>the End of civil Government being the

Pre&s;ervation of Per&s;on and Property, it would be a plain departing from the End of civil Government, to inflict any Puni&s;hment on</HI> Wickliff <HI>for his &s;o preaching.</HI> What the civil Authority is ob|liged to defend and &s;ecure, is not hurt at all by the &s;uppo&s;ed Action of <HI>Wickliff;</HI> and it is really acting again&s;t the De&s;ign of the civil Magi&s;trate's Tru&s;t, to hurt an innocent Subject.&mdash;Be&s;ides, the Right of private Judgment in Matters of Religion being unalienable, and what the civil Magi&s;trate is rather oblig'd to protect his Subjects equally in, both <HI>Wickliff,</HI> and they who de&s;ired to hear him, had a ju&s;t Right to remain where they were, in the Enjoyment of that Right, free from all Mole&s;tation from any Per&s;ons what&s;oever; agreeable to what has been &s;ufficiently evidenced in the foregoing Pages.&mdash;On the other Hand, &s;ee the <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> of &s;uppo&s;ing that the civil Magi&s;trate had rightful Authority to have &s;ent away <HI>Wickliff.</HI> If the Magi&s;trate had Right to &s;end him away becau&s;e the <HI>&s;tanding Clergy</HI> were unwilling he &s;hould preach (that being one of the Ca&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed in this Law) then the civil Authority mu&s;t have had equal Right to &s;end any <HI>other</HI> &s;uch Per&s;on away, as fa&s;t as they appeared; and con&s;equently they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had rightful Authority to hold their Subjects in the wor&s;t <HI>Slavery,</HI> i.e. to keep them from the Exerci&s;e of their <HI>private Judgment</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion;</HI> a Power to do which never was nor could be ve&s;ted in the civil Magi&s;trate, by the People, by any original Compact, which is truly &s;uppo&s;ed the Foundation of all civil Government. It alters not the Nature of civil Government, whether the Magi&s;trate be Prote&s;tant or Papi&s;t, Chri&s;tian or Pagan. What of Right ap|pertains to the civil Magi&s;trate by Virtue of his <HI>Office,</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o nece&s;&s;arily belong to him, tho' Popi&s;h, or Heathen. The Suppo&s;al therefore that the civil Magi&s;trate in <HI>England</HI> at that Day had rightful Authority to have &s;ent away <HI>Wickliff,</HI> for preaching the Go&s;pel without Leave of the Clergy, is big with too great an Ab&s;urdity, for a con&s;i&s;tent Prote&s;tant to &s;wallow. Suppo&s;e then the&s;e <HI>Colonies</HI> to have exi&s;ted at that Time, or <HI>Great Britain</HI> and the&s;e Colonies <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> now, as <HI>Great-Britain</HI> was then, and <HI>Wickliff</HI> to come into any of them and preach in &s;ome Pari&s;h without the Con&s;ent of the Incumbent, at the De&s;ire of a Number of People, it is certain, in this Ca&s;e none of the&s;e Colonies could have any rightful Authority to thru&s;t him out of their Borders, or do any Thing like it.&mdash;The <HI>&s;ame Rea&s;ons</HI> mu&s;t conclude again&s;t the&s;e Colonies Authority to
<PB N="64" REF="005520_0066_10184D41AAB72670">
tran&s;port him, for coming and preaching <HI>now</HI> without an Incumbent's Leave at the De&s;ire of a Number, as in the for|mer Ca&s;e; the &s;ame Principles and Rea&s;oning will hold equally true, applied to any &s;uch In&s;tance as now before us, any Time &s;ince the Reformation from Popery. The civil <HI>Peace</HI> is no Ways broken by this Action of <HI>preaching,</HI> of which we are &s;peaking: But indeed if any &s;hould take Occa&s;ion from it, to contend and quarrel with their Neighbours, as Papi&s;ts and Heathens have &s;ometimes done, the Apo&s;tle (<HI>James</HI> 4.1.) has &s;hown us the true Spring thereof, the <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> in Men's Hearts; the Outbreakings of which in <HI>Injuries</HI> to their Neighbours, fall under the civil Magi&s;trate's Cognizance.&mdash;And the Rights of <HI>Con&s;cience and private Judgment</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion</HI> are un|alterably the &s;ame: And 'tis a Scandal to Chri&s;tians, to con|tend and quarrel with their Neighbours for enjoying them, and inexcu&s;able in a Prote&s;tant State to make any Infringement upon them. And it was on the&s;e very Principles, which I here Advance (and by which this Law mu&s;t fall) that our fir&s;t <HI>Reformers</HI> acted, and on which all Reformations mu&s;t be built. And tho' our Nation in Times pa&s;t under the Influence of a bigotted Clergy, and arbitrary weak or popi&s;h Princes, have made Laws founded on Principles contrary to the&s;e I have been pleading for; yet they &s;eem in a great Mea&s;ure rooted out of the Nation: and the&s;e Principles of Truth have taken Root, and been growing ever &s;ince the happy <HI>Revolution,</HI> and Act of <HI>Toleration;</HI> and 'tis to be hoped, will prevail &amp; &s;pread more and more, until all &s;piritual Tyranny, and lording it over the Con&s;ciences of Men, be bani&s;hed out of the World.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall fini&s;h with ob&s;erving, That by Virtue of the <HI>Act of Toleration,</HI> all his Maje&s;ty's Subjects are &s;o freed from the Force of all <HI>Coercive Laws</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> relating to Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline, that they act their own <HI>private Judg|ment,</HI> without Re&s;traint:&mdash;That <HI>any Number</HI> of Chri&s;tians, greater or le&s;s, hear <HI>any Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter</HI> they de&s;ire, with|out Controul from the Will of others, or Authority of the civil State:&mdash;Since this is the Ca&s;e, and withal as plain as the Sun in the Meridian, that where &s;uch a <HI>Law</HI> as this I have been con&s;idering, takes Place, <HI>There</HI> People are abridged of that <HI>Chri&s;tian Liberty,</HI> which the &s;ame Per&s;ons would enjoy under the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, if they were in <HI>England.</HI> And how far therefore it falls &s;hort of denying and &s;ecluding them from
<PB N="65" REF="005520_0067_10184D46D5FA6760">
the Benefit of the <HI>Act of Toleration,</HI> I leave you to &s;ay, who well know, that it is expre&s;ly provided by the Terms of your <HI>Charter,</HI> that <HI>the Laws to be made in Virtue of it, &s;hall not be contrary to the Laws of</HI> England. This Right of private Judg|ment and Liberty now mentioned, is confe&s;&s;ed and &s;ecured to you by that Law which was the Glory of the Reign of WIL|LIAM and MARY; but by your Law now before me, it is denied to you. How you will clear it from a <HI>Contrariety</HI> to the former, I know not. Nor is this about a trivial Matter, or what is dependent upon the Will of your Legi&s;lature. The Rights of <HI>Magna Charta</HI> depend not on the Will of the Prince, or the Will of the Legi&s;lature; but they are the inherent na|tural Rights of <HI>Engli&s;hmen:</HI> &s;ecured and confirmed they may be by the Legi&s;lature, but not derived from nor dependent on their <HI>Will.</HI> And if there be any Rights, any Priviledges, that we may call natural and unalienable, this is one, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the Right of <HI>private Judgment,</HI> and Liberty of wor&s;hipping God accord|ing to our Con&s;ciences, without controul from human Laws. A Priviledge more valuable than the civil Rights of <HI>Magna Charta.</HI>&mdash;This we hold, not from <HI>Man,</HI> but from GOD: which therefore no Man can touch and be innocent. And all the Invaders of it will certainly find, when they &s;hall &s;tand at his Bar, from whom we hold this, <HI>that</HI> CHRIST <HI>will be King in his own Kingdom.</HI>&mdash;In the mean Time, it &s;tands Chri&s;tians in Hand to hold fa&s;t this Priviledge, and to be on their Guard again&s;t all Attempts made upon it. And I doubt not, tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who were apprehen&s;ive of this, and freely addre&s;&s;ed the Legi&s;lative Body of <HI>Connecticut</HI> (as I hear was done <HI>October</HI> 1742.) for a Repeal of this Law, did therein what was plea&s;ing to their great Lord &amp; Ma&s;ter which is in Heaven. They acted becoming &s;uch as dur&s;t not them&s;elves, and were willing to do what lay in their Power that others might not, <HI>Lord it over God's Heritage.</HI> Not that I would in&s;inuate, that there were no others <HI>like-minded</HI> with them&mdash;but that therein they &s;et an excellent Example for others to copy after, and what was proper to awaken the Attention of Chri&s;tians. It has commonly been the Ca&s;e, that Chri&s;tian <HI>Liberty,</HI> as well as Civil, has been lo&s;t by little and little; and Experience has taught, that it is not ea&s;y to recover it, when once lo&s;t. So precious a <HI>Jewel</HI> is always to be watched with a careful Eye: for no People are likely to enjoy Liberty long, that are not zealous to pre&s;erve it.&mdash;As a real Friend to it, I have given
