<P>A LITTLE boy, who&s;e papa was &s;o kind as to give him a real watch, which would go, and tell what o'clock it was, wanted to &s;ee the in&s;ide of it, and find out what it was that made it tick.

But though he &s;topped the tick|ing noi&s;e, he could find no live creature in it. He was very &s;orry he had &s;poiled his watch and tried to mend it; but he could not do that; for little boys know not how to make watches. He then took it to his papa, and a&s;ked him to be &s;o good as to mend it for him; but it was &s;o much broke, that his papa could not mend it. The little boy, when he found that he had quite

Many people would beat you for breaking your watch, but I &s;hall not do that: I &s;hall only take it all away from you, and not let you have any more watches till you grow bigger, and know better how to u&s;e them.

<P><HI>SALLY STING</HI> was a child no one was fond of, for &s;he was a cro&s;s girl, and took
<PB N="11" REF="021924_0009_0FB5FA0807785E68">great plea&s;ure in hurting any thing that was le&s;s than her&s;elf. She had a little kitten, and a very pretty one it was too, it had a black &s;pot at the tip of its tail, and one on its back, and a yellow one by the &s;ide of its right ear; and clo&s;e by its left eye, it had a black one, which looked like a patch when you were not quite clo&s;e to it. But this nice little cat <HI>Sally</HI> u&s;ed to tea&s;e very much: Sometimes &s;he would <FIGURE>

But <HI>Sally</HI> had &s;en&s;e to know what was right, and &s;he knew it was wrong to hurt any thing. Her mamma u&s;ed often to tell her &s;o; and one day &s;he made her &s;tand in the corner, with her hands tied behind her, for as &s;he made &s;o bad an u&s;e of them, it was not fit &s;he &s;hould be let to have them.

For tho&s;e who when they are young, will be cro&s;s and naughty, &s;eldom are good or kind when they are grown up: for this rea&s;on, all little boys and girls who wi&s;h to be happy and have their friends love them, &s;hould take great pains to be good whil&s;t they are little, or el&s;e may be they will never be good as long as they live. <HI>Dolly Pink</HI> was wi&s;e enough to think &s;o, and &s;he knew the only way to make her papa and mamma, and all her friends love her, was to be good, and do as &s;he was bid. So &s;he always
<PB N="15" REF="021924_0013_0FB5FA11F723F398">tried to plea&s;e them, and did not cau&s;e them to &s;peak to her more than once for the &s;ame thing.

<PB N="16" REF="021924_0014_0FB5FA18798D6DD0">or looked cro&s;s when &s;he was bid to do what &s;he did not like: for, like a wi&s;e and good child, &s;he thought her friends knew what was right better than &s;he did.

In this way &s;he u&s;ed to think and talk, and &s;o every body loved her dearly, and tried all they could to plea&s;e and make her happy. And when &s;he was a woman, &s;he was a very wi&s;e and good one, and knew how to teach and make her own little boys and girls good; and every body that &s;aw her loved her, and would do any thing they could to plea&s;e her.

<P><HI>DOLLY PINK</HI> was not the only good child that ever was in the world, for <HI>George Franks</HI> her cou&s;in, was as good as &s;he was. <HI>George</HI> was the only boy his papa and mamma had; but he had three &s;i&s;ters, of whom he was very fond, and though he was the younge&s;t of all, he took &s;o much pains with him&s;elf, and minded &s;o much all that was taught him, that he was &s;oon as wi&s;e as any of them, (for they were not much older than he was.) He was very fond of fruit and cakes, (as mo&s;t children are) but if any body ever gave him any, he would never eat one mouth|ful till he had given &s;ome to all his &s;i&s;ters; and if they did not chu&s;e any when he was going to eat it, he &s;aved &s;ome for them, till &s;ome time when they would like it better. He was very fond of dogs, and cats, and birds; hor&s;es too he liked much; but he was too little to have an hor&s;e, or ever to go into the &s;table, unle&s;s his papa took him in his arms.

<P>TWO little birds once before they were &s;trong enough to fly, got upon the edge of the ne&s;t, and tumbled from the top of an high tree down to the ground. A little boy who was walking with his mamma &s;aw them fall, and a&s;ked her if he might have them? Yes, my dear, &s;aid &s;he, though I think it is cro&s;s to rob a bird of her young ones, yet as the&s;e have fallen down, and cannot get into their ne&s;t again, you may pick them up, and carry them home, and take great care of them. Little <HI>James,</HI> as &s;oon as he had leave, ran to them and picked them both up very &s;oftly, that he might not hurt them. When he got home, he put them into a cage, and fed them
<PB N="20" REF="021924_0018_0FB5FA29DB6E4338">very often with bread, and rape, and hemp feeds. But I &s;uppo&s;e they had not been u&s;ed to &s;uch food, and it made them &s;ick; (for nobody can feed young birds &s;o well as their own mothers) and after three days one of them died. <HI>James</HI> was &s;orry that it was dead, but he &s;till took great care of the other; and af|ter he had had it two or three weeks, it began to feed it&s;elf; it was a goldfinch, and grew &s;o tame, that it would &s;et upon his finger and <FIGURE>

It eat out of his hand, and u&s;ed to &s;it upon his &s;houlder and the top of his head; indeed it never &s;eemed to be &s;o well plea&s;ed, as when &s;tanding or &s;itting upon little <HI>James:</HI> and he was &s;o kind to it, that it had great rea&s;on to be fond of him. He u&s;ed of|ten to leave the cage door open, that Dick might hop about the room when he plea&s;ed; and when he had been out as long as he liked, he flew into his cage again; and then <HI>James</HI> u&s;ed to &s;hut the door to keep him &s;afe. But one day he went to play with &s;ome boys, and forgot to &s;hut the door, and while he was gone, the cat got into the room where the cage hung; and the bird did not know the cat would hurt him, and flew out to the ground. But pu&s;s did not let it long &s;tay there, for &s;he ran to it as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw it, and eat it up in a minute. When poor <HI>James</HI> came back from play, he went to give his bird &s;ome bread; and when he did not &s;ee it in the cage, he.looked all round the room for it, and called Dick! Dick! all the time. He was much &s;urpri&s;ed that
<PB N="22" REF="021924_0020_0FB5FA2CC5FA1338">Dick did not come to him when he called: at la&s;t under one of the chairs, he &s;aw &s;ome of its feathers; &s;o he &s;tooped down to look <FIGURE>

How could you be &s;o carele&s;s as to leave the cage door open when you went out of the room?

<P>THERE was a little boy, who was &s;o &s;illy as to be afraid of dogs; and if he met one as he was walking, he would run away, and &s;cream as if he had been much hurt. One day he was taking a walk with his brother;

The dog thinking he was at play with him, ran after him, and caught hold of the flap of his coat, and &s;hook it about, yelping and making that growling noi&s;e dogs do when they are at play. This frightened <HI>Joe</HI> &s;o much, that he did not know what he was
<PB N="25" REF="021924_0023_0FB5FA3937C01840">about, or where he was going, but &s;creaming as loud as he could &s;hriek, he ran, not &s;eeing where he went, into a pond.

Poor <HI>Charles</HI> did not know what to do. If he &s;taid with him, he could not help him, and if he went, he feared he would be drowned before he could fetch any body to him. At la&s;t he thought he would jump into the water, and try what he could do to get him out: and ju&s;t as he had pulled off his coat
<PB N="26" REF="021924_0024_0FB5FA3D939F9710">to go in, a man came by, and a&s;ked him what he was going to do? O! &s;aid he, (crying &s;o the man could &s;carce make out what he &s;aid) my brother! my brother <HI>Joe</HI> has fallen into the pond, and I am going to try to help him! Pough! &s;aid the man, you cannot help him, child; you will both be drowned, you may be &s;ure, if you go in. I will fetch him out for you, &s;o pray &s;tand &s;till and let me try what I <FIGURE>

The man took him to the hou&s;e which <HI>Charles</HI> &s;hewed him; who walked home by the &s;ide of him, crying all the way. When they got there, their father thanked the man a great many times for being &s;o kind, and gave him &s;ome money for his trouble. <HI>Joe</HI> was put into a warm bed, and a doctor &s;ent for, who gave him &s;omething to do him good. At la&s;t he moved, and came to him&s;elf again; but it was a long while before he was quite well. So he had cau&s;e to remember running from a dog that would not have hurt him if he had been quiet; or if it had bit him, it would not have done &s;o much harm as his fright, and fall, and lay|ing in the water did: but dogs do not bite people if they do not hurt and teaze them. Children &s;hould not teaze dogs; but it is very fooli&s;h to be afraid of them. They need not touch <HI>&s;trange</HI> dogs they meet in the &s;treets; but to run from them is very &s;illy indeed.</P>

<P>ONCE there was a little boy who had a nice wheel-barrow, and his &s;i&s;ter <HI>Sophy</HI> had a very pretty doll. They u&s;ed to like to play in the garden, and &s;ometimes they called the wheel-barrow a coach, and put the doll in it to ride. One day as they were running ra|ther too fa&s;t, their coach tumbled over, and <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> the poor doll fell down and broke her no&s;e and
<PB N="29" REF="021924_0027_0FB5FA48E2E58860">face &s;adly. The little girl was &s;o &s;illy as to cry a great deal, and &s;aid he threw it down on purpo&s;e. Her mamma hearing the noi&s;e, went out to &s;ee what was the matter, for &s;he thought one of the children mu&s;t have been hurt very much, or &s;he would not have heard &s;uch a &s;creaming; but when &s;he found what the truth was, &s;he was quite &s;urpri&s;ed, as &s;he did not think her little girl would have been &s;o naughty as to cry, and be out of humour, becau&s;e while playing with her brother, the doll happened to be broken, without his mean|ing to let it fall out of his wheel-barrow. "I am quite a&s;hamed of you, &s;aid her mamma, and &s;hall take the doll away, and not let you play with it again; and if you do not leave off cry|ing directly, &s;hall not let you &s;tay in the gar|den to play with your brother any longer." "No, indeed, Ma'am, replied <HI>Charles,</HI> I did not intend to &s;poil my &s;i&s;ter's doll; and as &s;he was running as fa&s;t as I was, I did not.know &s;he did not chu&s;e the coach &s;hould go &s;o fa&s;t: be&s;ides, &s;he &s;aid her child liked to gallop along, and &s;he wi&s;hed we could make more ha&s;te; but
<PB N="30" REF="021924_0028_0FB5FA4C8A8D2C00">when the doll fell out, &s;he &s;aid I went a great deal too fa&s;t, and that I wanted to break her play-things. I am &s;ure I did not want to &s;poil any of her dolls, and am very &s;orry this one is broken, for it was a very pretty one, and when I am a man and have money, I will buy her another; but I wi&s;h &s;he would come and play, and be merry again now." Little <HI>Sophy</HI> was &s;till &s;o &s;illy as to cry and be <HI>cro&s;s</HI> becau&s;e her <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="31" REF="021924_0029_0FB5FA4FACD24228">doll was broken, though it was as much her own fault as her brother's; &s;o when her mam|ma found &s;he would not be good-humoured, though her brother tried to per&s;uade her to play, &s;he would not let her play in the garden, but took her in doors, and put her with her face in the corner of the room, till &s;he left off crying, grew good-humoured, and told her brother &s;he was &s;orry &s;he had been &s;o unkind to him, and would never behave &s;o again, if he would play with her. So they went to play again; but her mamma told her, &s;he mu&s;t not expect to be treated as if &s;he had been good all day, and theref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re &s;he &s;hould not let her read any pretty &s;tory till the next day, and not then, if &s;he was not good; but &s;he told the little boy, <HI>he</HI> might have the plea&s;ure of reading, as he had been very good, and did not wi&s;h to teaze his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ter at all. So when <HI>Sophy</HI> found how much better it was to be good than naugh|ty, &s;he was very &s;orry &s;he had been &s;illy, and always after played in very good humour with her brother, or whoever would be &s;o kind as to play with her.</P>

<P>THERE were two little girls who once lived near each other, and u&s;ed often to play together. They went to the &s;ame &s;chool, and always came home at the &s;ame time. It <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> is rather &s;trange they were &s;o fond of each other, for they were not at all alike in their tempers, or way of behaviour; for <HI>Polly Per|kins</HI> was a &s;ad little idle girl, &s;he never minded
<PB N="33" REF="021924_0031_0FB5FA53DE498A40">her work, or book, but liked nothing but play; &s;he was five years old, and could not read at all, &s;he could hardly &s;pell a word of three let|ters without a book; nay, one day when &s;he <HI>had</HI> a book, &s;he called T, O, P, <HI>bob,</HI> and R, O, T, &s;he called <HI>rat,</HI> and &s;o, many words &s;he called wrong, becau&s;e &s;he would take no pains to do better. Her mamma bought her many pretty books, to try to make her read them; but in|&s;tead of &s;triving to do that, &s;he only tore them to-pieces, and cut out the pictures, without caring what they were about. Her work too &s;he did &s;adly, and made it &s;o dirty it was not fit to be &s;een. She was &s;titching a pocket with blue &s;ilk, but &s;he did it in &s;o bad a manner, and &s;o unneat, that it was quite ugly to look at; and I believe &s;he was almo&s;t a year about it. But her friend <HI>Mary True</HI> did all her work quite in another manner; &s;he &s;titched &s;o clean and neat, that when &s;he had done her pocket, the &s;ilk looked as bright as when it fir&s;t came out of the paper, there were &s;ome pinks and ro&s;es upon it, and it was very pretty. <HI>Mary</HI> could hem and &s;ew as well a&s; &s;titch, and &s;he was

O! &s;he was a charming girl! and loved by every body who
<PB N="35" REF="021924_0033_0FB5FA5CCA22D170">knew her; &s;he always did as &s;he was bid at fir&s;t, without crying or fretting, and went to-bed the moment &s;he was called, after having made a hand&s;ome curte&s;y and wi&s;hed every body good night. If ever &s;he fell down, or hurt her&s;elf, &s;he did not &s;quall and &s;cream as &s;ome boys and girls do. Every body took notice how good &s;he was, and admired and loved her.</P>

<P>A MAN who had a large garden full of all &s;orts of fruit and good things to be eaten, lived by him&s;elf; &s;o that he could not u&s;e half a quarter of them; and yet was &s;o cro&s;s that he would not give any away; but kept them 'till they were quite &s;poiled; and then he u&s;ed to open the gate, and let &s;ome hogs and a&s;&s;es go in and eat them up. Only think how cro&s;s it was! not to give what would have been of &s;o much u&s;e to other peo|ple. His being &s;o, made all his neighbours di&s;like him; and they u&s;ed to call him the <HI>Cro&s;s Man,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Greedy</HI>; and the boys in the town, who had never been taught better, u&s;ed to pelt him with dirt and bean-&s;hells. It
<PB N="36" REF="021924_0034_0FB5FA5E77E2F220">was not pretty for them to do &s;o, though to be &s;ure he de&s;erved it.

He ought to have been puni&s;hed for doing &s;o; but his parents did not like to hurt him; and hoped when he grew older, he would be wi&s;er. But in&s;tead of that, he behaved the &s;ame, and &s;o was very unhappy and wretched, for nobody loved him, or cho&s;e to be with &s;o cro&s;s a man.</P>
