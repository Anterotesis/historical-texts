<P>"THE ble&s;&s;ed Virgin aid and protect thee! and when this poor frame, now worn out with infirmities, and &s;inking in the grave, &s;hall, ere to-morrow's &s;un, ri&s;e before its Creator in an immortal &s;tate&mdash;oh! may I then be pla|ced over thee as a guardian angel, though invi&s;ible to my child!&mdash;Weep not, Matilda, but"&mdash;</P>
<P>Such were the words delivered by madame Ma&s;erini to her daughter, as the latter held the dying hand of her mo|ther, and in an agony of grief li&s;tened to tho&s;e in&s;tructions, which &s;he was certain would be the la&s;t &s;he ever &s;hould re|ceive from a parent, who&s;e maternal tenderne&s;s and affec|tion were the mo&s;t &s;incere, and of which &s;he now would &s;everely feel the lo&s;s. Madame Ma&s;erini immediately after fell into a fainting fit, which la&s;ted &s;o long, that the nur&s;e as well as Matilda thought &s;he was no more; but in this they were mi&s;taken; for to the joy of all her attendants &s;he recovered, and inquired, as &s;he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> done be|fore, whether her &s;on (who was an officer) was yet arrived; they an&s;wered her in the negative; for as he had been in|formed &s;everal times that it was thought his mother's di&s;|order would prove fatal, it was known he might obtain
<PB N="2" REF="035833_0003_10093C282B302ED0">
leave of ab&s;ence from his regiment, which was then &s;ta|tioned in Flanders. But &s;ome little time before, an ex|pre&s;s had been &s;ent to him, &s;etting forth that madame Ma&s;erini was much wor&s;e, and they thought her life in great danger; they al&s;o mentioned that it was her particu|lar de&s;ire to &s;ee him; he was therefore now expected every hour: but after this fit &s;he &s;aid &s;he &s;hould not &s;urvive that evening, and &s;eemed extremely impatient to &s;ee her &s;on; &s;he &s;aid &s;he had &s;omething of the greate&s;t importance to communicate to him, which &s;he refu&s;ed to relate to her daughter; but &s;till finding that he did not arrive, &s;he a&s;ked for her confe&s;&s;or, when to her inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e and grief &s;he was informed that he was &s;ent for, that morning, by a &s;ick relation, ten miles off, and was not yet returned; &s;he called for pen and ink, and though &s;o weak as hardly able to be &s;upported in her bed, with great pain and diffi|culty &s;he wrote &s;everal lines, then dropped her pen, cla&s;p|ed hold of Matilda's hand, and expired.</P>
<P>The grief of all who were pre&s;ent was mo&s;t poignant; but particularly that of Matilda; &s;he now beheld her&s;elf an orphan with a very &s;mall fortune, which was not &s;uffi|cient to &s;upport her genteelly without &s;ome other addition; &s;he was bere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a mother who&s;e good in&s;tructions and ad|vice &s;he could now no longer receive; in &s;hort, &s;he was di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>Not many minutes after the di&s;&s;olution of madame Ma&s;erini, the phy&s;ician came in; he found the attendants &s;tupified with grief, and Matilda in the &s;ame po&s;ture as &s;he was at the moment her mother expired; he parted her hand from that of the corp&s;e, which &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to her bo|&s;om, and bathed with tears; but &s;he had the pre&s;ence of mind to take up the paper on which her mother had wrote, and when &s;he entered her chamber, threw it carele&s;sly in

the e&s;critoire, without once looking at the writing&punc; in &s;hort, her mind was in &s;uch a &s;tate that for many hours &s;he had not the lea&s;t remembrance of the affair.</P>
<P>About half an hour after the decea&s;e of madame Ma&s;e|rini, Alfred her &s;on arrived. When he fir&s;t heard of his mother's illne&s;s, he would have &s;et off for Paris directly, but was prevented by the indi&s;po&s;ition of a &s;uperior officer. Immediately as he received the la&s;t expre&s;s, he obtained leave of ab&s;ence for a month, and left Flanders the day after; but, unfortunately, in one part of his journey, where he was obliged to ride on hor&s;eback, the animal took fright and threw him; he was taken up for dead; but being only &s;tunned by the blow, he &s;oon recovered; yet it &s;erved to detain him a few days; as &s;oon as he was able to &s;tand, he made the be&s;t of his way to the city, but arrived too late to receive the important &s;ecret that madame Ma&s;erini &s;o much wi&s;hed to impart to him.</P>
<P>Madame Ma&s;erini was the younge&s;t daughter of a noble|man who&s;e power and dignity were well known in all parts of France; having no &s;on, he re&s;olved to aggrandi&s;e his name through his elde&s;t daughter; for which purpo&s;e, he determined to place his two younge&s;t in a convent; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevail on them to take the veil: in this ca&s;e, the fortune he would have been nece&s;&s;itated to have given them, might be added to that of their elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, which mo&s;t likely would procure her a hu&s;band of great note; he could then have his&punc; name transferred to his &s;on-in-law, and by that means the family honours would de&s;cend to po&s;terity, the &s;ame as by male i&s;&s;ue:&mdash;thus did the unju&s;t marquis intend to bury from the world two amiable young women, to &s;atisfy an empty and ridiculous ambition.</P>

young, and it was reported, through his ill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">;&mdash;the marquis now thought it full time to put his &s;cheme in execution; he accordingly per&s;uaded the young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e boarders for a few months, which they both readily a|greed to; he accompanied them him&s;elf to the conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of N****, and affected the greate&s;t grief at parting from them; in private he begged the lady abb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s to let no op|portunity pa&s;s that might ha&s;ten their de&s;ire of taking the veil. Felicia, the younge&s;t, &s;eemed perfectly contented with her &s;ituation; but her &s;i&s;ter, who was of a more lively di&s;po&s;ition, very much di&s;liked it; and though the greate&s;t art was u&s;ed in order to make her take to a religious life, yet it all proved ineffectual; for, at the year's end, though the former determined to comply with their wi&s;hes, yet Clementina declared her aver&s;ion to them, and proved ob|&s;tinate in her opinion; &s;he u&s;ed all the arguments in her power to per&s;uade her &s;i&s;ter to relinqui&s;h the thoughts of making &s;uch a place a re&s;idence for life; but Felicia was &s;o charmed with the convent and its inhabitants, that the con&s;tantly replied, nothing in the world &s;hould ever tempt her to leave them; &s;he accordingly took the white veil. Her father (who con&s;tantly received intelligence) read the news with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure; but it was in &s;ome mea|&s;ure damped by hearing that Clementina had &s;o great a di&s;like to follow her example, and that &s;he wi&s;hed much to be permitted to return home:&mdash;this reque&s;t he re&s;olved not to grant; as he thought time, and a little more u&s;e to the rules and orders of the place, might work an entire change in her &s;entiments.</P>
<P>It was at this period Louis XIV a&s;cended the throne of France; and, among others who had bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act at court on that occa&s;ion, was a young gentleman, the &s;on of an Italian of large fortune. He brought with him from
<PB N="5" REF="035833_0006_10093BEB99F8B268">
Italy his &s;i&s;ter, whom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y order of his father, he was to place in the convent of N****; the day &s;he was introdu|ced, he had an opportunity of &s;eeing Clementina; he was &s;truck with her beauty, and delighted with her conver&s;a|tion, and afterwards had &s;everal other interviews; for by the orders of the marquis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he was permitted to &s;ee any one in company with the lady abbe&s;s, or any other per&s;on whom &s;he could depend upon; this kind of behaviour, he thought, would be more likely to win her over to their pur|po&s;e, than by laying her under any re&s;traint; her di&s;po&s;i|tion being naturally good, and by far more inclined to yield to entreaty than force. Signor Ma&s;erini often came on vi&s;its to his &s;i&s;ter, who was placed with her lady&s;hip, and the cho&s;en companion and friend of Clementina:&mdash;it was at the&s;e times, when no one was pre&s;ent (which would often happen, the marquis's orders not being &s;trictly atten|ded to), that he would declare his pa&s;&s;ion, which he might plainly perceive was not li&s;tened to with di&s;like, Cle|mentina felt a &s;trong partiality for him, which &s;oon ripen|ed into love: &s;he told him the &s;tate of her affairs; but when he entreated her to elope with him from the convent, &s;he always reminded him that they mu&s;t expect nothing in point of fortune from the marquis. That, he an&s;wered, would not give him the lea&s;t concern; for his father, who had no children except his &s;i&s;ter and him&s;elf, was worth a con&s;iderable deal of money, and had often told him, provi|ded he could meet with a wife, who&s;e birth, virtues and accompli&s;hments, would bring no di&s;grace upon their hou&s;e, that wealth would be no object with him, as he &s;hould be able to give him enough to keep them not only in plenty, but in affluence.</P>
<P>Clementina's mind was on the rack which way to re&s;olve; if &s;he rejected the propo&s;al, &s;he would mo&s;t likely be obli|ged
<PB N="6" REF="035833_0007_10093C2E5B926150">
to remain in the convent for life, and be con&s;tantly hara&s;&s;ed with the importunities of all about her to take the veil; which would be wor&s;e than death; on the con|trary, if &s;he con&s;ented to fly with &s;ignor Ma&s;erini to Italy, &s;he mu&s;t run the hazard of travelling many miles, and when &s;he arrived in that country, would &s;ee no one that &s;he knew, except him&s;elf and his &s;i&s;ter;&mdash;the thoughts of leaving Fe|licia, the difficulty of e&s;caping, and the idea of what would be the con&s;equence if they were di&s;covered, made her &s;hrink with horror from the thoughts of leaving her pre&s;ent habi|tation. Thus &s;he delayed coming to a re&s;olution for near &s;ix months; when one morning as &s;he entered a clo&s;et be|longing to the lady abbe&s;s, &s;he perceived on the floor a let|ter, directed to her lady&s;hip; it was her father's &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al, and was broken;&mdash;&s;he at fir&s;t he&s;itated whether &s;he &s;hould read it; but at length determined to &s;ee the contents; which were, "that the marquis thought the manner in which &s;he was treated was too mild, and begged that for the future &s;he might be clo&s;ely kept to her chamber, and &s;tricter me|thods had recour&s;e to."&mdash;Ready to faint, &s;he ran to &s;ignora Ma&s;erini, who was equally &s;urpri&s;ed at the di&s;covery, and wi&s;hed her to comply with her brother's &s;olicitations.&mdash;Clementina, after &s;ome little time, re&s;olved to accept his propo&s;als&mdash;in the afternoon he was expected, and they thought that would be a good opportunity to inform him of their determination.</P>

<P>SIGNOR Ma&s;erini called in the afternoon, as was ex|pected&mdash;he only &s;aw his &s;i&s;ter, tho&s;e mea&s;ures being al|ready put in execution which the marquis had mentioned

in his letter. She informed her brother of the circum&s;tan|ces that had happened in the morning, and al&s;o acquainted him with Clementina's re&s;olution to leave the convent. At the&s;e words he was in raptures; but they were &s;oon &s;ubdued by the thoughts of what difficulties mu&s;t be &s;ur|mounted to e&s;cape from it; for Clementina was totally confined to her chamber; not even &s;ignora Ma&s;erini was permitted to &s;ee her&mdash;the&s;e orders had been given about an hour before&mdash;the young friends had therefore only time to fix, that whatever re&s;olutions the latter intended to put in practice, &s;he was to write them down, and contrive to drop them in the hand of the former at evening ve&s;pers. But both the brother and the &s;i&s;ter were at lo&s;s how to elude the watchful vigilance of the different people belonging to the convent, till a &s;cheme, propo&s;ed by &s;ignora, &s;eemed as if it would prove favourable. She told her brother to go to the hou&s;e of father Ab&s;alom, (a prie&s;t) who was expect|ed that night at a late hour to have a conference with the lady abbe&s;s, and to tell him her lady&s;hip could not receive him; he &s;hould then procure a dre&s;s as much like father Ab&s;alom's as po&s;&s;ible, and, at the &s;ame time when he was to have attended, to come to the gate of the convent, thro' which he might pa&s;s unnoticed, if he would hold up his handkerchief &s;o as to cover his face, which the reverend father generally did to avoid the night air. By this means he might get to the lady abbe&s;s's apartments; but in&s;tead of entering them, to turn round a contrary way, that would take him to a winding &s;tairca&s;e, which, after de&s;cending &s;ome time, would terminate in a large vaulted chamber; and in this place he was to wait the arrival of Clementina and his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>"But how is it po&s;&s;ible," returned &s;ignor Ma&s;erini, "if you &s;hould be able to meet me there, that we can e&s;cape? You will certainly be known."</P>

why &s;he wept. The latter, by degrees, and with the great|e&s;t circum&s;pection, informed her of her intentions of leav|ing the convent. Horror &s;howed it&s;elf in every feature of Felicia while &s;he li&s;tened to the relation; at length, over|come by &s;urpri&s;e, grief and weakne&s;s, &s;he fainted.

<P>THE &s;ituation of Clementina was now dreadful beyond expre&s;&s;ion. The di&s;tant tinkling of a clock at a remote part of the mona&s;tery proclaimed the hour to be ten. The wind, which had been &s;o very high, had entirely drop|ped, and the moon, quite ob&s;tructed by heavy clouds, could not be di&s;cerned; large drops of hail beat again&s;t the windows, and by degrees increa&s;ed to a violent &s;torm; the mo&s;t tremendous claps of thunder followed fa&s;t on each other; fla&s;h after fla&s;h of vivid lightning darted through the &s;hattered ca&s;ements, which had no &s;hutters. This war of elements was far more dreadful, it being an uncommon time of the year, the latter end of January. The body of Felicia lay &s;till in the arms of her &s;i&s;ter, who, totally in&s;en&s;i|ble, re&s;ted her hand on the &s;ame pillow, till a violent clap of thunder, which &s;hook the convent, rou&s;ed her from this reverie. She &s;tarted up, and at fir&s;t hardly knew where &s;he was; but recollection &s;oon came with redoubled force; it wanted but one hour to the time when &s;he was to meet her friend; &s;he was unable to come to a re&s;olution in what manner to act. She took up the letter &s;he had received from &s;ignora Ma&s;erini, and read it once more over.</P>
<P>She &s;till con&s;idered, that, if &s;he e&s;caped, &s;he might once more be happy; but if &s;he remained in the convent, there was not the &s;lighte&s;t hope that &s;he &s;hould ever enjoy ano|ther hour of peace or comfort. She had now no one to leave, that could any way claim her regard or tenderne&s;s: the maternal love and affection of a mother &s;he had never known; her father had not fulfilled that tender name, by either a&s;&s;iduity or kindne&s;s; her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter &s;he hardly
<PB N="11" REF="035833_0012_10093BF7CC9494C0">
ever &s;aw, as &s;he was placed, before her remembrance, with a relation of her mother's in Germany, who took the care of her education. The old lady vi&s;ited the marquis but once only, accompanied by his daughter, and then made but a &s;hort &s;tay; yet, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">his little time, the lady Eleanor's behaviour to her &s;i&s;ters was proud and di&s;dainful, &s;o as not to call forth either e&s;teem or fondne&s;s. As to friends, &s;he had none except &s;ignora, for the marquis never &s;uffered them to cultivate any acquaintance. Felicia would have been the only cau&s;e that could have made her leave the con|vent with regret; &s;he, alas! was now no more; &s;he had conceived a &s;incere friend&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ip for &s;ignora Ma&s;erini, and her heart plainly told her, her affections were placed on her brother; &s;he therefore thought it would be more prudent to run the hazard of elopement with two per&s;ons by whom &s;he was certainly beloved, than remain in a place where her life would be made uncomfortable. But &s;till &s;he was chilled with horror at the thoughts of being di&s;covered; and the lo&s;s of her &s;i&s;ter greatly preyed upon her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>It was now near the time when &s;he was to repair to &s;ig|nora Ma&s;erini's room: &s;he put &s;ome trinkets of her &s;i&s;ter's, which Felicia had given her before &s;he took the white veil, into a &s;mall &s;ilver ca&s;ket which &s;he could place in her pocket, and among them the picture of her mother; &s;he &s;hed a flood of tears at the thought, that if the original had lived, how happy &s;he might now have been; &s;he then, according to the directions in the letter, wrote with her pencil feign|ed memorandums relative to their e&s;cape, and the names of &s;everal roads quite contrary to tho&s;e they meant to take; and dropped this book in the place where it was mo&s;t likely to be found.</P>
<P>Eleven o'clock now &s;truck, and the hail had in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated, though the thunder and lightning &s;till

continued, when Clementina took a la&s;t farewell of her de|parted &s;i&s;ter; &s;he embraced the corp&s;e, wept over it, and was for &s;ome time unable to move, till &s;he at la&s;t tore her|&s;elf away from the body, and, with her eyes &s;wimming in tears, implored the Author of all events to &s;upport her in the few critical hours &s;he mu&s;t undergo. With a trem|bling hand &s;he then unbarred the door, which opened into a long gallery, on each &s;ide of which were different cells; &s;he could not take the lamp, for fear of the light glancing into any of the apartments, and was therefore only guided by each fla&s;h of lightning that came through a large window at the further end. So weak as to be hardly able to walk, &s;he at length arrived at the ca&s;ement, and &s;at down on a &s;eat under it to recover her &s;trength. The way &s;he had al|ready come was by far the mo&s;t dangerous on account of di&s;covery, there being one or more inhabitants in each of the rooms &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed. She now went through &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages that led to a large vaulted chamber, and from thence began to a&s;cend a &s;tone &s;tair-ca&s;e that wound round the &s;outh tower of the convent, and took her entirely away from the cells below, belonging to the nuns, to the &s;leeping rooms of the boarders above. The thunder in this place had a mo&s;t awful &s;ound; the lightning, though it could only enter a &s;mall painted ca&s;ement which &s;tood at a great height, yet &s;erved to &s;how the gloomy horrors of the place.</P>
<P>She was already half way up; but, terrified at the thoughts of her &s;ituation, &s;he re&s;ted for a few moments again&s;t the old iron railing, when a light &s;tep &s;eemed to move on the &s;ame &s;tair. Almo&s;t convul&s;ed with horror, &s;he &s;hrunk back, and was fortunately unable to call out, when at the &s;ame moment a &s;trong fla&s;h of lightning dart|ed from the window above, and &s;howed her the figure of a
<PB N="13" REF="035833_0014_10093BF9558B6180">
man; the &s;ight of it was but momentary, and all again was &s;ilent and dark. With breathle&s;s agitation, and con&s;i|derable quickne&s;s, &s;he ran up the other part of the &s;tair|ca&s;e, flew acro&s;s two pa&s;&s;ages, and arrived at the chamber of &s;ignora Ma&s;erini. She gave the &s;ignal they had fixed on, and the door was carefully opened by her friend, who with a&s;toni&s;hment received Clementina, fainting in her arms.</P>
<P>She &s;oon recovered, and informed &s;ignora of the death of her &s;i&s;ter, and al&s;o of the event that had &s;o much alarmed her. The former intelligence &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed and griev|ed at; but the latter, concerning the per&s;on on the &s;tairs, &s;he told her was her brother, who was to wait in the cham|ber below. This circum&s;tance &s;ignora had neglected to mention in the letter, which might have been the cau&s;e of di&s;covery. She in&s;i&s;ted on Clementina's taking a gla&s;s of wine, and helped her to dre&s;s in the apparel of a prie&s;t, and then made her&s;elf ready in another di&s;gui&s;e of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>She now thought it full time to attend her brother, and begging Clementina to &s;upport her&s;elf through this great trial, &s;he &s;oftly opened the door; they proceeded to the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and de&s;cended it. It was quite dark, the thun|der and lightning being over. When they had got to the bottom, &s;ignora, in a whi&s;per, called her brother, who in|&s;tantly an&s;wered. He was going to congratulate them on having got &s;o far without di&s;covery; but his &s;i&s;ter &s;topped him&mdash;"This," &s;aid &s;he, "is not a place for compli|ments." They all three then rea&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed through a long pa&s;&s;age, and arrived at the door of the lady abbe&s;s's apartments; they &s;topped there about two minutes, and then, holding their handkerchiefs partly over their faces, they cro&s;&s;ed a large hall, and arrived at
<PB N="14" REF="035833_0015_10093C39B4C44148">
the door at the further end; they here pa&s;&s;ed two per&s;ons, who made no inquiries. This door led them to an inner court, and from that to an outer one, in which there were &s;everal porters; but they, &s;uppo&s;ing them to have returned from a conference with her lady&s;hip, a&s;ked no que&s;tions. They had now only to pa&s;s the out&s;ide gates, which they did in the &s;ame manner, without any ob&s;tructions, and &s;aw them&s;elves totally free from the convent.</P>
<P>Signora and her brother were overjoyed at their good fortune; but Clementina, though &s;he was happy in having e&s;caped, yet &s;orrow &s;till hung upon her brow. They walk|ed about half a mile, and then entered the chai&s;e that waited for them; &s;ignor Ma&s;erini's &s;ervant was on hor&s;e|back; they de&s;ired the po&s;t-boy, whom they were obliged to acquaint with the whole affair, to drive as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;i|ble, and he might depend on being rewarded. Signora acquainted her brother (who had very tenderly inquired after Clementina's health, and the cau&s;e of her melancho|ly) of Felicia's death, and begged him not to force her to talk; that her &s;pirits, which within a few hours had been &s;o greatly &s;hocked, might again be a little compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation was ju&s;t: Clementina had in a little time gone through a great deal of trouble: the &s;urpri&s;e and concern which followed the finding of her father's let|ter, the grief &s;he felt at tho&s;e orders being &s;o &s;oon put in execution, the terror and anxiety &s;he was under when &s;he read &s;ignora's billet, the &s;udden &s;hock of her &s;i&s;ter's death, the horror &s;he felt during the &s;torm, with the alarm &s;he re|ceived on the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and her dread of being di&s;covered the whole night, con&s;pired to overwhelm her with &s;en&s;a|tions almo&s;t equal to madne&s;s; her looks plainly confirm|ed that &s;he was exceedingly ill, and it did not e&s;cape &s;ig|nora or her brother. He was almo&s;t di&s;tracted to know
<PB N="15" REF="035833_0016_10093BFC31492448">
in what manner to act. To wait for advice, would be as bad as to di&s;cover them&s;elves; yet to &s;ee her in &s;uch a &s;tate, without any aid, was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing beyond expre&s;&s;ion. He could not per&s;uade her to take any nouri&s;hment, though he had provi&s;ions in the chai&s;e to prevent their &s;topping on the road for any thing el&s;e than to change hor&s;es. Signora was extremely &s;orry to &s;ee her friend &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed; &s;he perceived a fever was coming on; &s;he therefore advi&s;ed her brother, about three o'clock in the afternoon, to order the po&s;t-boy to turn out of the high road, and drive into a wild part of the country, which, though it might take them out of the way they intended to go, yet in &s;uch a place they might find &s;ome retired cottage, where they could &s;top for &s;ome time in &s;afety; for &s;he was very certain Clementina would not be able to proceed on the journey.</P>
<P>Her brother con&s;ented, and ordered the boy accordingly, who turned into another road, which led them to a wild heath, and from that to a remote, &s;olitary fore&s;t. They continued in one track for &s;ome miles, till it began to grow dark, when they de&s;cended into a deep valley, at the bottom of which was a cottage that &s;tood by it&s;elf. The chai&s;e then &s;topped, and &s;ignor Ma&s;erini and his &s;i&s;ter alighted; they were obliged to help Clementina carefully out, who, &s;upported by each of their arms, walked up to the retired dwelling, which &s;eemed to be the re&s;idence of virtue, contentment and happine&s;s.</P>

<P>"WHO would not relinqui&s;h the gaudy pomp and &s;plendour of a court, the co&s;tly robe, the &s;umptuous fea&s;t, the deceitful courtier, and all the pride of emp|ty greatne&s;s, to &s;pend their few remaining days in &s;uch a cot as this? The happy pair, ble&s;&s;ed with each other's love, who&s;e health and &s;trength permit them to earn their daily bread, and care for no one, might here enjoy repo&s;e, and, with comfort to them&s;elves and others, breathe out a life of piety and virtue." Such were the thoughts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ignor Ma&s;erini, as he aided to &s;upport Clementina to the door of the cottage; he knocked, and it was opened by a young man who &s;eemed not yet to have attained his twen|tieth year.</P>
<P>"Friend," &s;aid the di&s;gui&s;ed prie&s;t, "admit under your ho&s;pitable roof three travellers, who for one night beg a lodging, and will repay you to the utmo&s;t of their power, with gratitude and prayers."</P>
<P>The young &s;hepherd (for &s;uch his dre&s;s denoted him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

be) courteou&s;ly invited them into a &s;mall clean room, where, on one &s;ide of the fire, &s;at a man and woman &s;eemingly much advanced in years, and on the other a beautiful young girl, who looked to be about eighteen: they ro&s;e, and &s;eemed greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at the entrance of the prie&s;ts: the old man in&s;tantly ordered &s;upper for his reverend gue&s;ts, after a&s;&s;uring them they were &s;incerely welcome.</P>
<P>Signora Ma&s;erini placed Clementina next to her, while her brother went to the po&s;t-boy, whom he liberally re|warded, and told him to make the be&s;t of his way home, and acquaint his ma&s;ter he had been with only one gentle|man, quite a different road from that they had travelled; he then re-entered the cottage with Edward, who&s;e hor&s;e they turned loo&s;e in a field behind it. Clementina, &s;ince he had been out, had fainted, and was ju&s;t recovering.</P>
<P>Amazement might be &s;een in each face of the cottagers; that three prie&s;ts &s;hould ride in a chai&s;e attended by a &s;er|vant, was &s;trange, as &s;uch &s;ort of people u&s;ually walked; the effeminate beauty of two of them was remarkable; and then one of them fainting, was a&s;toni&s;hing. Signora thought it would be better to inform them of their &s;itua|tion at once, and tru&s;t to their genero&s;ity in concealing them; &s;he therefore gave her brother the hint, and called on one &s;ide the old woman, whom &s;he acquainted with the whole affair, while he did the &s;ame to the man. They both greatly wondered in what manner they could e&s;cape, but readily promi&s;ed their protection.</P>
<P>Clementina all this time &s;eemed totally in&s;en&s;ible of what was going forward, and, in &s;hort, was in a &s;tate of &s;tupidity; for &s;he hardly gave any an&s;wer to tho&s;e que&s;|tions that were put to her, nor could they per&s;uade her to take any nouri&s;hment; &s;he was therefore undre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

put into a warm bed. Neither the brother nor the &s;i&s;ter could partake of the homely fare that was &s;et before them; but about eight o'clock &s;ignor Ma&s;erini left the cottage with the young &s;hepherd and Edward, and walked to a &s;mall cot, that belonged to the father of the former, who was acquainted by his &s;on with the hi&s;tory of the gentleman he had brought. There was one bed to &s;pare, which &s;ignor Ma&s;erini took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and Edward &s;lept with Cyril, which was the young man's name.</P>
<P>La Faril, the old cottager, in&s;i&s;ted on his daughter Sa|bina &s;itting up with Clementina, and begged &s;ignora to re|tire to re&s;t, as he was &s;ure the fatigue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ave under|gone mu&s;t make &s;leep very nece&s;&s;ary. She took his advice, and lay down in a &s;mall room next to Clementina's. Both La Faril and his wife gave Sabina a charge to be very care|ful of the young lady, and then they them&s;elves bowed un|der the influence of the drow&s;y god.</P>
<P>Signor Ma&s;erini was at the cottage early the next morn|ing; he eagerly inquired after Clementina's health, and was informed by Sabina that &s;he was very ill, and had been delirious the greater part of the night; &s;he was now a&s;leep, but was &s;o di&s;turbed &s;he feared it would not refre&s;h her; neither his &s;i&s;ter nor her mother was up, and her father was gone out. He had not changed his dre&s;s, but was &s;till in the di&s;gui&s;e of a prie&s;t. He a&s;ked Sabina whe|ther there was any medical man lived near; &s;he &s;aid there was one about three miles off, who always attended their family; he a&s;ked her for a direction, which &s;he gave hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; and not con&s;idering the hazard he ran, he re&s;olved to go to him.</P>
<P>It was hardly light when he &s;et off: he had not got above a mile, when he was acco&s;ted by a man who was cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

<P>There was now the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for them to be con|cealed; for as there were no witne&s;&s;es to contradict an af|fair which by appearances &s;eemed probable, he was di&s;|tracted to think, that if they were taken, Clementina might &s;uffer the puni&s;hment of a murderer: and in &s;uch ca&s;es &s;trict inquiries and &s;earch were made through France. In what manner to act they knew not: Clementina was too ill to travel; and if &s;he could, there was not a doubt but they would be overtaken; the officers might be here in three or four hours' time; and La Faril would run a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in concealing them. Edward had no change of dre&s;s; he arrived at the cottage a little while after his ma&s;ter in the morning; Cyril, the young &s;hepherd, who, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> found, was to marry Sabina, had &s;et off early with his fa|ther on a &s;hort journey, and would not return till night. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of them had promi&s;ed &s;ecre&s;y, and begged &s;ignor Ma&s;erini and his &s;ervant would &s;leep there as long as he thought proper.

"Is it not po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid &s;ignore Ma&s;erini, "to have it warmed by fires?"

<P>At nine o'clock, &s;ignor Ma&s;erini took his leave, and walked to the cottage of Cyril and his father; he informed them of the whole affair concerning the cave, by permi&s;&s;ion of La Faril, who knew them to be too much his friends to di&s;cover it. Signor Ma&s;erini begged both of them, if any inquiry &s;hould be made after him, to declare they knew no|thing of him; he conjured them to lay the &s;ame injunc|tions on a young girl who was a di&s;tant relation to them, and kept their hou&s;e; all which they promi&s;ed faithfully to perform. The place was &s;o exceedingly retired, that none of them had been &s;een, except by La Faril, his wife and daughter, Cyril, his father, the young girl and the man before mentioned; nor was any &s;tranger ob&s;erved in that part, &s;ometimes for three months together; and the only way they had of procuring povi&s;ion was, by going to a &s;mall town four miles di&s;tant. Signor Ma&s;erini thanked both the father and the &s;on for their ho&s;pitality towards him, and, after wi&s;hing them a good night, retired to his bed.</P>

<P>THE dejected lover had now time to recollect his &s;ituation. Though his father was exceedingly fond of him, yet there was a haughty pride and ob&s;tinacy in his di&s;po&s;ition, that made him tremble l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t he &s;hould di&s;ap|prove of his proceedings. It was true, he had &s;everal times told him that, with re&s;pect to his marrying, he &s;hould con&s;ider wealth as no object; but u&s;ed always to lay a particular &s;tre&s;s on his con&s;ent being fir&s;t obtained: this la&s;t circum&s;tance he had never mentioned to Clemen|tina. He al&s;o knew him to be whim&s;ical and capricious, in&s;omuch that it would not be unlikely, &s;hould they ever be &s;o fortunate as to arrive in Italy, but he might refu&s;e his con&s;ent to their nuptials, though not capable of alledg|ing any rea&s;on for his di&s;like. He therefore determined to per&s;uade Clementina to be married to him before they made them&s;elves known to his father, whom they could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> deceive by telling him the ceremony had not been performed: if he approved of her as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> daughter, it was all very well; if, on the contrary, he rejected her, it would be out of his power to part them, as &s;he would be his by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties on earth; for, &s;hould the wor&s;t hap|pen, and his father totally di&s;card him, at the death of a brother of his late mother's, no one could prevent his tak|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very good fortune; and till that period, which was not likely to be long, his uncle being a man much advanced in years, he could &s;upport him&s;elf and wife by indu&s;try and application to his pencil, which art he was a proficient in, though he only learnt it as an ac|compli&s;hment. But &s;till the thoughts of their being di&s;co|vered
<PB N="24" REF="035833_0025_10093C471AADD198">
again intruded on his mind, and he &s;hrunk with horror from the idea that Clementina might &s;uffer an ig|nominious death: &s;leep refu&s;ed its aid, and the re&s;t of the night was &s;pent in melancholy reflections on the dangers they had pa&s;&s;ed, and di&s;agreeable conjectures on tho&s;e that might &s;till be to come. He ro&s;e about &s;ix, more fatigued than when he retired to re&s;t, and took the advantage of the darkne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> morning, to walk to the cottage; he found them all up, as they had determined to enter the cave be|fore day-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight. Clementina was con&s;iderably better; &s;ig|nora Ma&s;erini was in good &s;pirits, but they were damped by &s;eeing her brother look &s;o ill: &s;he however concealed her unea&s;ine&s;s, for fear of alarming Clementina, who had al&s;o taken notice of it.</P>
<P>After a ha&s;ty breakfa&s;t, they thought it full time to pro|ceed to the garden; it was a di&s;agreeable morning, though not &s;o cold as might have been expected for the time of the year; yet there was a chilling dampne&s;s in the air, which made it far more uncomfortable than a &s;evere fro&s;t; and a few &s;mall &s;tars, &s;cattered about the heavens, gave the hea|vy black clouds which encompa&s;&s;ed a large &s;pace a more dreary appearance. It was ju&s;t beginning to grow light, when the melancholy party came out from the cottage. La Faril went fir&s;t: his thoughts were fixed on the &s;imi|larity of the pre&s;ent &s;cene with that when he conducted his only &s;on to the &s;ame gloomy habitation.</P>
<P>The recollection of this circum&s;tance drew a tear from his aged eye; for the good old man could not help paying that tribute to his memory, though he had &s;hed many on account of his vices and extravagances. Signor Ma&s;erini walked after him; he was wholly taken up with the idea of their being di&s;covered; and when he looked on Cle|mentina, who re&s;ted on one arm while his &s;i&s;ter laid hold
<PB N="25" REF="035833_0026_10093C0BF9DCC650">
on the other, he almo&s;t cur&s;ed him&s;elf for leading her into &s;o much danger.</P>
<P>Clementina was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee him look &s;o ill, but fear|ed nothing while &s;he was under his protection.&mdash;Signora had no misfortunes of her own; to &s;ee them happy, &s;he thought would make her &s;o; and therefore her anxiety or happine&s;s was heightened or decrea&s;ed according to the &s;i|tuation of her brother and her friend.&mdash;Sabina and her mother followed, with their hands and eyes lifted towards heaven, imploring ble&s;&s;ings on their vi&s;itors, and praying that they might remain undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the care, La Faril touched the &s;e|cret &s;pring, and the door flew open;&mdash;they were received by Edward, who had, as he was ordered, kept good fires all night, &s;o that the place felt perfectly warm: their con|ductor then told them that Sabina &s;hould come every night after it was dark, to inform them if any thing particular had happened, and to be u&s;eful in any way that might &s;erve to make them comfortable:&mdash;&s;ignor Ma&s;erini return|ed him a thou&s;and thanks for his kindne&s;s and friend&s;hip.&mdash;La Faril and his family then took their leave, and the door clo&s;ed after them.</P>
<P>The cave, as was before mentioned, ran a great way back;&mdash;it was divided into three regular apartments, which, though narrow, were each of them long:&mdash;the fir&s;t they made their &s;itting room; in the &s;econd &s;ignor Ma&s;erini &s;lept; and in the third, Clementina and his &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;Edward had a &s;mall bed placed for him clo&s;e to the entrance, that he might be ready to give an alarm if he heard any noi&s;e that &s;eemed to threaten danger.&mdash;They received no light but from candles or lamps:&mdash;this, added to the antique manner in which it was fitted up, and the hollow echo that &s;ent back every &s;ound they uttered, gave the place a

gloomy and melancholy appearance;&mdash;but, di&s;agreeable as it might &s;eem, it was to them a comfortable retreat;&mdash;it might pre&s;erve them from their enemies; and with that hope, any &s;ituation would be acceptable, though, if po&s;|&s;ible, ten times more di&s;gu&s;ting than that they now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Sabina arrived at the cave about ten o'clock at night, attended by Cyril;&mdash;they informed &s;ignor Ma&s;erini that no inquiries had been made after them that day; but they had heard the king's officers were within a few miles of the place; and there was not a doubt but they would remain there until the next morning. The young lovers &s;topped about an hour, and then took their leave.</P>

<P>IT was near twelve o'clock wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ignor Ma&s;erini, who had been reading to Clementina and his &s;i&s;ter ever &s;ince the departure of Cyril and Sabina, declared he was fatigued, and propo&s;ed going to re&s;t; they both readily con&s;ented, and had retired to their chamber about a quarter of an hour, when Edward ran into his ma&s;ter's room, with the news that the officers were certainly arrived, for he had heard them talking clo&s;e to the cave.</P>
<P>Fortunately, he did not &s;peak loud; and &s;ignor Ma&s;erini, who was ju&s;t beginning to undre&s;s, de&s;ired him not to di&s;turb the ladies, and he him&s;elf would come to the door and li&s;ten to their conver&s;ation.&mdash;They both proceeded to the mouth of the cave; the wind was high, and the noi&s;e which it occa&s;ioned among the trees, prevented them from hearing but now and then a few words.&mdash;The fir&s;t per&s;on

who&s;e voice they could di&s;tingui&s;h, was Cyril.&mdash;Signor Ma&s;erini was very glad he was there;&mdash;he &s;eemed to be talking to one of the officers&mdash;</P>
<P>"You &s;ee," &s;aid he, "there are no &s;igns of a place where we could conceal any one, even if we had ever &s;uch an inclination."</P>
<P>"Hold&mdash;not &s;o fa&s;t, young man," an&s;wered a &s;tern voice:&mdash;"we &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> particularly this place; for I remember, &s;ome years back, being here on the &s;ame er|rand, after a young thief, who, though he was &s;een to en|ter this cottage, yet could not be found. He was, I be|live, that old man's &s;on."</P>
<P>"Ah!" exclaimed La Faril," call him not by that name; he is now no more; and tho&s;e epithets are ill be|&s;towed on one who has long &s;ince been in his grave, and is by this time partly turned to earth again"&mdash;Here the old man bur&s;t into tears, and, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, retired to the hou&s;e; for they heard him no more.</P>
<P>The officers &s;topped about half an hour, during which time Cyril remained with them.&mdash;Signor Ma&s;erini won|dered at his having &s;topped &s;o late, but looked on it as a fortunate circum&s;tance, as La Faril was too weak and in|firm to attend them in a proper manner. He was exceed|ingly glad to think that neither his &s;i&s;ter nor Clementina had known any thing of the matter, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the thoughts how happy they would be, when he informed them the affair they mo&s;t dreaded was now over; nor were his conjectures wrong; for his intelligence gave them the greate&s;t plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The following night, Sabina arrived at the cave. She told them that when Cyril and her&s;elf entered the cottage from &s;eeing them the night before, the father of the former had called to tell them the officers were within two miles
<PB N="28" REF="035833_0029_10093C7C71667C00">
of them; he had heard it at a place where he had been in the afternoon; they therefore thought it would be be&s;t for Cyril to &s;tay all night, in ca&s;e they &s;hould come at a late hour to &s;urpri&s;e them. It was fortunate they took that precaution; for about midnight they were knocked up by the unwelcome vi&s;itors. Cyril let them in; and, after their coming from the garden, they &s;topped about a quarter of an hour, and then departed.</P>
<P>Their only fear was now to fix in what manner they &s;hould proceed to Italy without di&s;covery; but at all events they determined to remain in the cave, at lea&s;t a month, that the affair might be in &s;ome mea&s;ure forgotten; and they could then con&s;ult what di&s;gui&s;e would be the mo&s;t proper for them to travel in. They had re&s;ided in their habitation near a fortnight before La Faril dared to make them a vi&s;it; but receiving intelligence that the of|ficers were certainly returned, he took the fir&s;t opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rtunity&punc; to &s;ee them, and propo&s;ed they &s;hould travel to Italy in the di&s;gui&s;e of Savoyards, as he had dre&s;&s;es which would fit them, and every thing proper for that character; they hav|ing been made for a ma&s;querade. His &s;cheme met with the greate&s;t approbation, and they accordingly &s;et about carrying it into execution.</P>
<P>In about three weeks every thing was prepared, and the morning fixed when they were once more to venture forth in &s;earch of happine&s;s. Sabina and her mother attended them very early, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t in putting on the dre&s;|&s;es. La Faril arrived &s;oon after; and at &s;ix o'clock they thought it full time to &s;et off, as it would be nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould get &s;ome di&s;tance from the cottage before day|light. La Faril made &s;ignor Ma&s;erini perfectly acquainted with the way acro&s;s the country: and in ca&s;e any que&s;|tions were a&s;ked them by the villagers, they were to reply
<PB N="29" REF="035833_0030_10093C974A59A0B0">
they were going to Italy, the place where &s;uch &s;ort of people mo&s;tly re&s;ide. Cyril al&s;o attended to take his leave. The &s;pring of the cave was turned, and they once more breathed in open air: yet the thoughts of leaving the place which had pre&s;erved them from their enemies, created a pang in their brea&s;ts, and particularly &s;ince they knew not how &s;oon they might once more wi&s;h to be con|fined within its clo&s;e rece&s;s. Signor Ma&s;erini cla&s;ped La Faril's hand, and &s;tammered out his gratitude, accompa|nied with tears, while the good old man, who&s;e &s;ilver hairs and aged form denoted tho&s;e pearly drops which hung up|on his withered cheek were not the fir&s;t &s;oft emblems of his feeling heart, pre&s;&s;ed him to his bo&s;om; then, almo&s;t overcome with weakne&s;s and the effect of years, he nearly funk in&s;en&s;ible on the earth&mdash;This was too much for &s;ignor Ma&s;erini;&mdash;he pre&s;&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter and Clementina to ha&s;ten their departure, and hurried away from the &s;pot to which he before &s;eemed rooted.</P>
<P>It was an exceeding cold morning, and the twinkling bright &s;tars which illumined the heavens, plainly &s;how|ed it to be a &s;evere fro&s;t. They got three miles from the cave before day-light, and continued travelling without any di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances happening on the road, except the curio&s;ity of the pea&s;ants, who&s;e homely enter|tainment and good nature made ample amends for their ignorance.</P>
<P>After &s;ome days, they had the plea&s;ure to enter Italy. Signor Ma&s;erini hired lodgings &s;ome miles from his fa|ther's re&s;idence, and entreated Clementina to become his, before he made him&s;elf known to him. She was very un|willing to con&s;ent; but at la&s;t, overcome by the per&s;ua|&s;ions of the brother and the &s;i&s;ter, he had the rapture to receive her as his own, about a fortnight after their arrival.
<PB N="30" REF="035833_0031_100937CA40650360">
The only difficulty that now remained was, to make it known to his father, which he determined to do in three or four days after their marriage, but fir&s;t wrote to La Faril. In the letter he inclo&s;ed a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent, and &s;ent it by a friend who was going that way, as he was certain every method would be taken to intercept any letters di|rected to him, as La Faril lay under the greate&s;t &s;u&s;picion in point of concealing his &s;on, as well as &s;ignor Ma&s;erini.</P>
<P>The day arrived on which he was to pay a vi&s;it to his father. He begged his &s;i&s;ter to &s;tay with Clementina, as &s;he would be in want of company, and was a &s;tranger to the place. He &s;et off early in the morning, and, after &s;ome hours' quick travelling, during which time his ideas were entirely taken up in thinking of his father, and in what manner he &s;hould be received, he arrived at the large hea|vy gates of the abbey. With a trembling hand he pulled the bell, but could not hear it ring. After another at|tempt, he found the wire was ru&s;ty; yet it made a noi&s;e. A thought &s;truck him, which chilled him with horror&mdash;his father might be dead!&mdash;for he made him&s;elf known to no one &s;ince his coming to Italy, but his friend who carried the letter to La Faril; and he could give no intelligence concerning his friends, as he arrived the &s;ame night as &s;ig|nor Ma&s;erini, from Spain, was taken ill, and did not go out till he proceeded on his journey to England, when he promi&s;ed to leave the letter as he went through France.</P>

<P>THIS idea had not cro&s;&s;ed his mind five minutes before a man and a boy approached him: he a&s;ked them if they could tell the rea&s;on why that abbey was uninhabited?</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="035833_0032_10093C9A7241E7E0">
"Heaven ble&s;s you, ma&s;ter!" &s;aid the man: "you mu&s;t &s;urely be a &s;tranger in this part, if you have not heard of the old gentleman's death who lived here."</P>
<P>Signor Ma&s;erini turned pale; the bridle dropped from his hand, and he mu&s;t have fallen upon the ground, had he not been received into the arms of the villager.</P>
<P>"You are not well, &s;ir," &s;aid the man, as he placed him on a &s;eat under the large heavy portico of the abbey.&mdash;"Lubin, run and get the gentleman &s;ome water from yonder &s;pring."</P>
<P>The boy obeyed, and brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ome in a pitcher which he had in his hand; he was per&s;uaded to drink a &s;mall quantity, and &s;oon recovered. He informed the pea&s;ant he was a di&s;tant relation of the late count, and was come upon a vi&s;it to the abbey; that the hearing &s;o &s;uddenly of his death had quite overcome him.</P>
<P>"Ah, your honour," replied the man, "there has been &s;trange doings for the&s;e la&s;t &s;ix months; heaven knows be&s;t;&mdash;but one cannot be hanged for thinking, as the &s;aying is."</P>
<P>"Strange doings! for heaven's &s;ake explain your&s;elf, friend," &s;aid &s;ignor Ma&s;erini, "for I have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to be intere&s;ted in the affairs of the count."</P>
<P>"If you will &s;tep with me to my cot, &s;ignor, I will re|late to you the circum&s;tances that have happened. My wife expects me home to dinner, as I mu&s;t return, in le&s;s than an hour, to my labour in yonder vineyard"</P>
<P>He readily a&s;&s;ented; and having walked a &s;mall di&s;tance, they arrived at his habitation. The hor&s;e was turned in|to a field When they entered the cottage, a neat middle-aged woman was preparing dinner: they wi&s;hed much their gue&s;t would partake of their homely fare; but he could not eat.&mdash;They had not re&s;ided in that part above &s;ix

months, therefore knew nothing of &s;ignor Ma&s;erini's per|&s;on He conjured the man to begin his narration; and the hone&s;t hu&s;bandman complied, as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P>"You, no doubt, &s;ignor, were acquainted with young Percival Ma&s;erini and his &s;i&s;ter Si&s;era, the only children of the late count. Twelve months have not yet pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince they both took leave of their father at that very abbey, and travelled into France, on account of &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s which required Percival's attendance at court, as Louis XIV had ju&s;t then a&s;cended the throne. Si&s;era was to be placed in the convent of N****, while her brother &s;taid, which they &s;uppo&s;ed would not be above four months; and then they were to return together. The count for &s;ome time received letters from them both: but though the bu&s;ine&s;s which cau&s;ed their journey was fini&s;h|ed at the expiration of the four months, they did not by any means &s;eem inclined to return to Italy; and, in a little while after, their corre&s;pondence dropped; for though letters were continually &s;ent to them, no an&s;wers were received.</P>
<P>"This gave the count great alarm, and he wrote to a principal per&s;on near the place, concerning them. In a little time he received information that his &s;on had run away with a young lady from the convent of N****, where he had placed his &s;i&s;ter; that &s;he al&s;o had eloped with them, as well as the &s;ervant who &s;topped with Percival in France: he concluded with &s;aying, the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch was making after them, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed the young lady had poi&s;oned her &s;i&s;ter, who was placed in the convent with her, had taken the white veil, and was found dead in her bed the morning after her departure.</P>
<P>"This news, &s;ignor, was like a thunderbolt to the old count: he had not a doubt but they would be taken.
<PB N="33" REF="035833_0034_10093C9BF71E9C68">
From that day he drooped, and in about a week after was laid up with a violent fever. Count D'Ollifont, his ne|phew, was &s;ent for." Here Percival trembled: he knew D'Ollifont to be his enemy. The man continued&mdash;"He attended his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, in&s;omuch that he recovered enough to &s;it up for a few hours every day, and di&s;patched him to find &s;ome intelligence of his children: he accordingly &s;et off for France, but returned at the end of the &s;econd day, with a letter which he ac|quainted his uncle was given him on the road by a me&s;&s;en|ger, &s;ent from France for that purpo&s;e; it came from a friend of his who re&s;ided there, and acquainted him that both &s;ignor and &s;ignora Ma&s;erini were no more; that the former had fallen in a duel with an officer of the guards, who was going to &s;ecure them; and that the latter was &s;eized with a violent grief, which turned her brain, and &s;he had found means to poi&s;on her&s;elf, unknown to tho&s;e who had the care of her; that lady Clementina was placed in the Ba&s;tile, till it was &s;ettled what puni&s;hment &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer; but that &s;he was not married to &s;ignor Ma&s;erini. This news cau&s;ed a relap&s;e in the old gentleman's di&s;or|der. Nor was it he alone who &s;uffered: every dome&s;tic of his hou&s;ehold, &s;ignor, &s;hed tears for the lo&s;s of two ami|able children, who were never known to give a tender parent one pang of &s;orrow, except in this circum&s;tance, and that co&s;t them their lives."</P>
<P>"Would it had!" repeated &s;ignor Ma&s;erini to him&s;elf. "That ever I &s;hould have lived to have &s;een this day!"</P>
<P>The woman was too much employed in cooking her hu&s;|band's dinner, and the hu&s;band too much taken up in eat|ing it, and telling the &s;tory, to take any particular notice of him; or el&s;e the inward workings of his &s;oul might ea|&s;ily have been ob&s;erved. The man continued:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="035833_0035_10093C51E5ADE3A8">
"The old count now grew con&s;iderably wor&s;e; his phy&s;icians gave him over, and, in about a week after his relap&s;e, he died of a broken heart. when he heard of the death of his children, he altered his will; the &s;ervants were all left mourning, and a genteel legacy; old Ab&s;alom a comfortable allowance for life; his tenants a twelve|month's rent; except which, and a few other legacies, he bequeathed the whole of his fortune to count D'Ollifont. Among the e&s;tates is Gra&s;ville Abbey, which has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ut up ever &s;ince the death of count Ma&s;erini; nor has any of the furniture been removed."</P>
<P>"How happened that, my friend?"</P>
<P>"I know not, your honour; but folks &s;ay &s;trange things&mdash;that there has been &s;oul play, and that the place is haunted by the father and his children; but it is known for certain, that count D'Ollifont intended to &s;leep there the night o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his uncle's funeral, but could not re&s;t: he &s;tarted up about midnight, left the place with his &s;ervants directly, and the next week returned to Spain, where he was &s;ent for at the time his uncle was taken ill."</P>
<P>Signor Ma&s;erini inquired if he him&s;elf had ever &s;een any thing at the abbey to confirm the reports of its being haunt|ed, and how he came to be &s;o particularly acquainted with tho&s;e affairs relative to its late inhabitants.</P>

<P>WHEN the iron rod of adver&s;ity falls &s;uddenly upon us, and misfortunes of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing nature unexpect|ly darken our future pro&s;pects, &s;urpri&s;e for a little time gets the better of our feelings; amazement and horror gain &s;uch an a&s;cendency over our intellects, that, in the relation of our griefs, we forget for &s;ome time the nature and cau&s;e of them, while we li&s;ten with attention to the frivolous &s;tory of the circum&s;tances by which they were occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>Signor Ma&s;erini was in this &s;tate while the hu&s;bandman related to him the account of his father, and the villainy of count D'Ollifont. His a&s;toni&s;hment was &s;o great, that the death of the former, and the total lo&s;s of his fortune, were entirely forgotten, and he thought only on the fal&s;e|hood his cou&s;in had propagated. He left the cottage; his hor&s;e took his own cour&s;e for &s;ome time; nor did he per|ceive he was entering by degrees into a thick wood, till &s;ome trees ob&s;tructed his way; he leaped from his hor&s;e, and threw him&s;elf on the ground; the thoughts of his &s;ituation now fla&s;hed on his memory, and the lo&s;s of his father he regretted with the mo&s;t &s;incere grief. The impo|&s;ition which had been put in practice to deprive him and his &s;i&s;ter of their fortunes, excited both his &s;urpri&s;e and
<PB N="36" REF="035833_0037_10093C5386295CB0">
anger; in &s;hort, the different emotions he felt, almo&s;t drove him to a &s;tate of di&s;traction.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he remained for near two hours, till, harra&s;&s;ed through di&s;tre&s;s and fatigue, he fell into a &s;lum|ber. Horrid dreams di&s;turbed him, and his &s;leep was both unea&s;y and di&s;agreeable; yet he remained in this &s;tate of forgetfulne&s;s till it was nearly dark: he &s;tarted up and mounted his hor&s;e, which had not moved from his &s;ide; he remembered he had promi&s;ed Clementina and his &s;i&s;ter to be at home early in the evening; but that would now be impo&s;&s;ible, as the wood was intricate, nor was he acquainted with the way out. He wandered about in &s;earch of the right path for near two hours, but was un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, till chance led him to the direct track: he follow|ed it, and in a little time found him&s;elf clear of the laby|rinth. He was very ill, and hardly able to ride; the cold had &s;eized him by being &s;o long in the open air; he, how|ever, continued a good pace till he once more found him&s;elf before the gates of Gra&s;ville Abbey.</P>
<P>The night was very dark, the thunder rolled at a di&s;|tance, and faint fla&s;hes of lightning followed one after ano|ther with con&s;iderable quickne&s;s; he &s;topped once more to look at the place where he had &s;pent &s;o many happy juvenile hours, and where he had that day hoped to have been received with cordiality and tenderne&s;s. He had ex|perienced the rever&s;e; he had found his father was no more, and that he had been duped out of his right by one who was allied to him by the ties of blood, and, as he had &s;uppo&s;ed, by tho&s;e of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>A tear fell from his eye while he looked on the venerable &s;tructure, every part of which &s;eemed de&s;erted; a gloomy &s;tillne&s;s reigned through the heavy pile, nor was the &s;o|lemn &s;ilence broke but by the bird of night, which had
<PB N="37" REF="035833_0038_10093CA39DC2E198">
taken up its habitation under one part of the p&ograve;rtico. The idea of the place being haunted now entered his imagination.</P>
<P>"Would to heaven," &s;aid he, "the report I have heard was true, that I might be permitted to conver&s;e, nay, only to &s;ee, the &s;pirit of my &s;ire! &s;urely he would&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by a &s;tong fla&s;h of lightning, which darted right on his face, and was followed b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a loud <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of thunder. Though he was &s;truck &s;ilent, his eye was &s;till fixed on the abbey; the noi&s;e of the thunder had not died away above three minutes before a violent cra&s;h was heard at the other part of the building; it &s;eemed like the falling of armour, and continued for &s;ome little time.</P>
<P>Signor Ma&s;erini was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment; horror and expectation &s;eized him at the &s;ame moment; he turn|ed his hor&s;e round, and rode to the &s;ide whence the noi&s;e &s;eemed to proceed; all again was &s;ilent, yet he &s;till con|tinued locking on the place. It was by the we&s;t tower&mdash;he recollected the account he had heard of the light being &s;een there. At the moment he was thinking on this cir|cum&s;tance, a faint glimmering pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall ca&s;ement in the very part of the we&s;t tower the woman had de&s;cribed. His &s;ituation may be more ea&s;ily imagined than de&s;cribed: He was a perfect &s;tatue with a&s;toni&s;hment; &s;till he thought it might be fancy; but he was thoroughly convinced, when a &s;tronger light appeared in the &s;ame place a few mi|nutes afterwards, but di&s;appeared in an in&s;tant. Every nerve was &s;tiffened with horror; he &s;till drew nearer that part of the abbey; five minutes had not elap&s;ed before the light again appeared in the &s;ame place; he now plain|ly perceived a figure pa&s;s, bearing a lamp; it vani&s;hed as quick as the former light had done, and all again was &s;ilent and dark.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="035833_0039_10093C564F6E8BD8">
His pa&s;&s;ions were now wrought up to the highe&s;t pitch; he galloped round to the front gates, alighted, and in vain attempted to enter the abbey; every entrance was &s;trongly fa&s;tened; his brain was di&s;ordered, and he &s;till continued to force the doors; but, after a long time, finding his ex|ertions all in vain, he again mounted his hor&s;e, and rode as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible towards his own home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>SIGNORA Ma&s;erini waited with impatience the return of her brother; &s;he wi&s;hed much to hear of her father's health, and in what manner he received the account of Clementina: nor was Clementina le&s;s anxious; her &s;pi|rits were depre&s;&s;ed, &s;he trembled for fear of ill news, yet the vivacity of her &s;i&s;ter-in-law &s;upported her tolerably well through the day. Night approached, and the time when &s;ignor Ma&s;erini promi&s;ed to be at home expired: his fa|ther might have detained him; &s;everal circum&s;tances might have happened to make him later. With the&s;e thoughts they in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;atisfied them&s;elves till it grew late; they were then exceedingly unhappy at not &s;eeing him: the roads he had to come were often infe&s;ted by banditti.</P>
<P>A little while after midnight, a loud rap was heard at the door: Edward flew to open it; neither Si&s;era nor Clementina could a&s;k who it was, before &s;ignor Ma&s;erini &s;tood before them: his appearance for a moment &s;truck them motionle&s;s with &s;urpri&s;e; nor was it to be wondered a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: the di&s;order of his dre&s;s, and the wildne&s;s which dart|ed from his eyes, made his figure altogether horrible.</P>
<P>"How does my father?" a&s;ked his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="035833_0040_10093CA718E7E678">
"Well," he exclaimed; "but if you wi&s;h to know, Si&s;era, a&s;k the angels in heaven: they be&s;t can tell thee."</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;he cried, and bur&s;t into tears: "my father is no more; I know it by thy looks&mdash;by the &s;trange an|&s;wers you give to my que&s;tions."</P>
<P>"You are right," &s;aid he: "our father has paid the debt of nature."</P>
<P>He &s;eemed now rather more compo&s;ed; yet complained of violent pains in his head and limbs. Signora Ma&s;erini grieved much for the lo&s;s of her father: &s;he could get no further intelligence from her brother's di&s;cour&s;e, which was very incoherent and difficult to be under&s;tood, but that her father was no more, and they were duped out of their right; but by whom, and in what manner, &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly find out. He talked much of an appearance he had &s;een in the abbey; but they looked upon it as the effect of a di&s;ordered brain.</P>
<P>The morning found them &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Signor Ma&s;erini was in a high fever, and quite delirious, his &s;i&s;ter almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and Clementina very little better; the former immediately &s;ent for a phy&s;ician who lived near, and had always attended their family: &s;he hoped from him to receive &s;ome i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">telligence concerning her father's affairs, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ituation of her brother prevented him from communicating. Edward was di&s;patched, and in a little time returned with the gentleman they &s;o much wi&s;hed to &s;ee.</P>
<P>He was a character univer&s;ally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in Italy; his abilities were equally exerted in behalf of the poor and tho&s;e in a higher &s;phere of life; he was a friend to the in|digent and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of every cla&s;s, yet looked upon with admiration and re&s;pect by all who were &s;o happy as to be known by him. Such was the man who, with all the
<PB N="40" REF="035833_0041_10093C5B2182DB80">
marks of a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;urpri&s;e in his countenance, was conducted by Edward to &s;ignora Ma&s;erini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he informed her that it was &s;uppo&s;ed, by all who knew them, that both &s;he and her brother had been dead &s;ome time; he al&s;o confirmed the news of her father's death; &s;he would not, however, detain him to relate to her how &s;uch a report had been &s;pread, till he had fir&s;t &s;een her brother: he had &s;ome knowledge of the phy&s;ician, yet every an&s;wer he gave to their que&s;tions, proved him in a &s;tate of in&s;ani|ty. Clementina and Si&s;era anxiou&s;ly inquired the gentle|man's opinion; he told them he had a very violent fever, and &s;ome very alarming &s;ymptoms; nor could he give any &s;atisfactory an&s;wer concerning what might be the i&s;&s;ue of his di&s;order: he however a&s;&s;ured them he would do all in his power to forward his recovery.</P>
<P>They both returned him their &s;incere thanks. Si&s;era begged to know how the report concerning their death could be believed&punc; and the particulars of her father's di&s;|&s;olution, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he attended him in his illne&s;s. He an&s;wered in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> affirmative, and related to her exactly the &s;ame train of circum&s;tances which the hu&s;bandman had before communicated to her brother. Clementina was in the room at the &s;ame time he mentioned the account of her having been &s;uppo&s;ed to poi&s;on her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Her &s;ituation is more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed: that &s;he &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected to murder a &s;i&s;ter whom &s;he &s;o dearly loved, and who&s;e death &s;he &s;o much regre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ted&mdash;the idea was almo&s;t too horrid for her to &s;upport. An illne&s;s of &s;ome days followed the &s;udden &s;hock &s;he felt at the phy|&s;ician's recital; for though no proof could have been brought to confirm &s;o terrible a charge, yet &s;he &s;huddered at the thought of the di&s;tre&s;s and horror it would have occa&s;ioned her. They now wondered not at Percival's ill|ne&s;s,
<PB N="41" REF="035833_0042_10093CA8A16D7AD8">
and &s;uppo&s;ed his talking &s;o much about the light and appearance in the abbey, was occa&s;ioned by the report of its being haunted.</P>
<P>New difficulties now perplexed them: a week had elap&s;|ed, and no &s;igns of amendment appeared in &s;ignor Ma&s;eri|ni's di&s;order; yet all their money was nearly exhau&s;ted. In this dilemma they re&s;olved to apply to the phy&s;ician; he immediately lent them as much as they de&s;ired; and if at any time they &s;hould want more, begged they would &s;peak, and he would accommodate them.</P>
<P>In about a month &s;ignor Ma&s;erini began to alter for the better; he talked more rationally, and by degrees gained &s;trength; in &s;ix weeks he was able to leave the room, and &s;oon after, by the a&s;&s;iduity and judgment of the doctor, found him&s;elf nearly as well as ever. He returned the good man a thou&s;and thanks for his care and friend&s;hip, and hoped it would &s;oon be in his power to repay him the &s;um he had &s;ent them: he al&s;o begged him to contradict, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;candalous report his cou&s;in had pro|pagated, and make it known that he now intended to live by the practice of his pencil. The phy&s;ician promi&s;ed to comply with his wi&s;hes, and a&s;&s;ured him he &s;hould con&s;i|der him&s;elf happy to &s;erve him in any re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Signor Ma&s;erini paid a vi&s;it to the old uncle, at who&s;e death he was to receive the fortune before mentioned;&mdash;he was a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ight of him; railed at count D'Ollifont for his villainy, and te&s;tified the greate&s;t joy at &s;eeing his nephew.</P>
<P>Percival now began to apply him&s;elf to his profe&s;&s;ion; he was &s;oon known, but received with coldne&s;s by tho&s;e who once called them&s;elves his friends; his abilities, however, gained him patrons, and his indu&s;try pre&s;erved them. He was in a little time able to di&s;charge his debt
<PB N="42" REF="035833_0043_10093C5E1B54A0B8">
to the phy&s;ician, and found he could earn not only a com|fortable but a genteel provi&s;ion. He determined, however, if po&s;&s;ible, to retrieve &s;ome part of his father's fortune, yet re&s;olved not to act ra&s;hly, but proceed by a due cour&s;e of law. In the fir&s;t place, he wi&s;hed much to &s;ee the in&s;ide of the abbey: this took up a great deal of time; he was near three months before he could get a &s;anction to enter it: he had then to &s;end to Spain for the keys, as count D'Ollifont had them in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, nor would he give them up without great trouble; in &s;hort, it was near &s;ix months before he could gratify his wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hes, of once more &s;eeing the in&s;ide of Gra&s;ville Abbey. The light and figure he had &s;een in the we&s;t tower continually haunted his ima|gination; and though he was not by any means &s;uper&s;ti|tious, yet many di&s;agreeable ideas &s;erved to perplex him; he, however, never mentioned the circum&s;tance to any one &s;ince the recovery of his rea&s;on; not even to his wife or &s;i&s;ter; as he naturally &s;uppo&s;ed it would prey upon their &s;pirits, and make them fearful of &s;earching the abbey, which he was determined to do alone. Having got the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, the day was fixed for his departure. Clementina and Si&s;era wi&s;hed much to accompany him; he begged them not, as he knew it would hurt his &s;i&s;ter extremely&punc; to enter the family man&s;ion, under their pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, and could give no plea&s;ure to the former. He ac|cordingly &s;et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">; they were detain|ed a long time on the road by a violent &s;torm, and did not arrive at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Abbey till it was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">.</P>

<P>SIGNOR Ma&s;erini did not intend to enter the building that night; yet curio&s;ity prompted him to take a view of the we&s;t tower. He accordingly di&s;mounted, and told Edward to hold his hor&s;e at the front gates, while he walk|ed round the abbey. Having arrived at that part where he had before &s;een the figure and the light, he &s;tood &s;ome time ob&s;erving the window, when a faint glimmering pa&s;|&s;ed a &s;mall ca&s;ement a little above it. He thought it might be fancy, yet in about two minutes &s;aw it again; His re&s;olution was now fixed; he re&s;olved to enter the ab|bey directly; having returned to Edward, without commu|nicating his rea&s;on, he ordered him to open the gates immediately.</P>
<P>The poor fellow was a&s;toni&s;hed, and naturally &s;uppo&s;ed his ma&s;ter's head was again affected. "For heaven's &s;ake, &s;ir," &s;aid he, "do not attempt to enter &s;uch a drea|ry place at this time of night, and in the dark."</P>
<P>"Your light, Edward," returned his ma&s;ter, "will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erve me; therefore open the gates without delay."</P>
<P>The man reluctantly produced the keys: great exertion was required to turn the lock; it however, after &s;ome lit|tle-time, yielded to force, and they beheld them&s;elves in the large paved court. Edward fa&s;tened the hor&s;es on the out&s;ide; at the front doors they were again detained on account of the fa&s;tenings being ru&s;ty; but after a little trouble they opened them, and di&s;covered the large hall or entrance of the abbey: it was &s;upported by columns of the ancient orders, and arched over in the Gothic &s;tyle; at the farther end were a pair of heavy folding doors, which led to an exten&s;ive &s;uite of apartments; on each &s;ide wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="44" REF="035833_0045_10093C5FCF902950">
a flight of &s;tone &s;tairs, which wound round to the different rooms on both &s;ides of the building.</P>
<P>Gra&s;ville Abbey was an ancient &s;tructure, and had, in former times, been a place of religious wor&s;hip. Some monks, at a time when Italy was involved in war, kept them&s;elves concealed in this place, on account of atrocious crimes they had committed again&s;t the &s;tate, by keeping up a corre&s;pondence with the enemies of their country&punc; they were all di&s;covered except one, who &s;ecreted him&s;elf in an ob&s;cure part of the abbey, while his companions &s;uf|fered the mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;hment that could po&s;&s;ibly be in|flicted on them. Their only aim was now to de&s;troy the &s;urviving one; they accordingly found means to mix a large quantity of poi&s;on in &s;ome food which he had con|cealed, and which they ob&s;erved he partook of every day. The &s;cheme &s;ucceeded, and he fell a &s;acrifice to their in|vention; for they found the victuals after that time were never touched. He died, however, in that part where he u&s;ually re&s;ided, for his body was not di&s;covered till many years after; and the abbey from that time was called after his name.</P>
<P>The late count Ma&s;erini's father purcha&s;ed the e&s;tate ju&s;t before his marriage, and had the whole of the internal part repaired; from him it de&s;cended to his &s;on, who re|&s;ided in it the remainder of his life. Signor Ma&s;erini plainly perceived nothing had been moved in the hall, as every article was in the &s;ame order as if the place was in habited, and his father &s;till the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it&punc; but the appearance of the furniture plainly told it had been taken no care of for &s;ome time. He began to a&s;cend tho&s;e &s;tairs which led to the we&s;t tower.</P>
<P>Edward followed: but his ma&s;ter, after &s;ome little time, &s;uddenly turned round, and de&s;ired he would wait below
<PB N="45" REF="035833_0046_10093CAF6F2F1DE8">
and take care of the hor&s;es. The man begged of him with tears, not to go alone. Signor Ma&s;erini was plea&s;ed with this mark of his fidelity, and ha&s;tily replied&mdash;"However &s;trange, Edward, my conduct may appear to you at this time, believe me, I have the mo&s;t weighty rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify my behaviour; and, if I live to return, you &s;hall be ac|quainted with them."</P>
<P>He then ran up &s;tairs&mdash;and, &s;trange as it may appear, was never &s;een again.</P>
<P>Edward &s;tood for &s;ome time fixed with amazement&mdash;there was a my&s;tery in his words and looks, which plainly told all was not right. He heard him a&s;cend the &s;tairs for &s;ome time, till the &s;ound of his foot&s;teps died away, and all was again &s;ilent: he then walked &s;lowly acro&s;s the court, and &s;eated him&s;elf under the portico; the night was not by any means cold; he therefore cho&s;e that place in pre|ference to the in&s;ide of the abbey, as he was near the hor&s;es. Sleep in a &s;hort time overpowered him, and he did not wake till two in the morning:&mdash;he thought it &s;trange his ma&s;ter was not returned, but waited another hour with &s;ome degree of impatience; at the expiration of it he was &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed; yet to enter the abbey without a light, would be madne&s;s; he ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fore re&s;olved to defer it till day-break.</P>
<P>Edward had heard of the abbey's being haunted, yet he always laughed at the idea; his natural courage and intre|pidity forbid his believing &s;uch fabulous reports: the only rea&s;on he could alledge for his ma&s;ter's &s;tay, was, that the wind might have blown out the lamp when he was at &s;ome intricate part of the building; and in that ca&s;e it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for him to have found his way back, there being &s;everal &s;uites of apartments which were never inhabited in the count's life-time, and which &s;ignor Ma&s;e|rini might hardly ever have &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="035833_0047_10093C6161ADA0B8">
As &s;oon as it was light he again cro&s;&s;ed the court, and a&s;cended tho&s;e &s;tairs which his ma&s;ter had done before; he followed the marks of his feet up a con&s;iderable height, and then traced them through &s;everal rooms that led to the we&s;t tower: one of the&s;e, which was rather larger than the others, was covered with foot&s;teps of different &s;izes; and in one part of it lay the picture of Clementina, which &s;ignor Mazerini always wore next his heart; the ribband to which it was tied &s;eemed as if it had been torn by force, and the boards were &s;tained with &s;everal &s;pots of blood. There was not in any other apartment the lea&s;t mark of a foot, nor any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">igns of their having been opened.</P>
<P>Edward was a&s;toni&s;hed; he almo&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf in a dream; yet every object realized the &s;cene. He knew not in what manner to act; to &s;top any longer in the abbey was of no u&s;e; yet to whom was he to apply!&mdash;He at length re&s;olved to go immediately to the phy&s;ician, and re|late to him the circum&s;tance, as he would be the propere&s;t per&s;on to advi&s;e with concerning tho&s;e mea&s;ures they ought to take relative to &s;ignor Ma&s;erini's di&s;appearance, as well as in what manner they &s;hould proceed in communicating the news to his wife and &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Edward took up the picture, and placed it carefully in his pocket; he then de&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and clo&s;ed the doors after him; but determined to lock neither them nor the out&s;ide gates. Having placed his ma&s;ter's hor&s;e in one of the &s;tables belonging to the abbey, and mounting his own, he departed with the utmo&s;t &s;peed towards the hou&s;e of the phy&s;ician.</P>

<P>EDWARD found him&s;elf at the end of his journey in a few hours. Fortunately, the good man was at home, and heard his recital with the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation and &s;ur|pri&s;e; he by no means approved of either the wife or &s;i&s;|ter being informed of this dreadful news, till it was more fully confirmed; and having, from the &s;ervant's account, obtained two officers of the civil power to thoroughly &s;earch the building, he re&s;olved to attend them him&s;elf; and they &s;et off in le&s;s than three hours after Edward's arrival.</P>
<P>The evening was advancing, when they beheld at a di&s;|tance the lofty towers of the abbey; they were there|fore obliged to defer their intention till the next morn|ing.</P>
<P>Neither Clementina nor Si&s;era expected &s;ignor Ma&s;e|rini's return till the evening following the day he left his lodgings. Edward, therefore, informed the phy&s;ician they would not be unhappy though they &s;hould receive no intelligence from them. As &s;oon as it was light they en|tered the abbey, attended by a workman who was able to remove any kind of intricate wood work which might tend to a di&s;covery. They fir&s;t examined all tho&s;e apartments that led to the we&s;t tower, and which, by the marks of the foot&s;teps, &s;eemed as if &s;ignor Ma&s;erini had cro&s;&s;ed them: they plainly perceived the &s;pots of blood, but could di&s;co|ver no other mark or clue to their wi&s;hes, in either of the rooms. They then &s;earched each part on that &s;ide of the building; but their diligence proved un&s;ucce&s;sful: in &s;hort, every rece&s;s of the abbey was looked into with the mo&s;t &s;crutinizing attention, yet not the lea&s;t &s;ign could be
<PB N="48" REF="035833_0049_10093C65D3673190">
di&s;covered that indicated a mortal to have been in the place, except <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he foot&s;teps and the blood. They were all at a lo&s;s what to &s;uppo&s;e; and about evening they fini&s;hed their &s;earch, and left the abbey more perplexed than when they entered it. Edward took his ma&s;ter's hor&s;e from the &s;table, and &s;hut the gates, but determined to leave them, as before, unlocked.</P>
<P>After a ha&s;ty meal, the phy&s;ician, two officers and Ed|ward, &s;et off for the former's habitation: it was very late before they arrived there; the men were liberally reward|ed for their trouble. Edward then con&s;ulted what me|thod would be the mo&s;t prudent, to inform the ladies of this mournful event; the old gentleman undertook him|&s;elf the di&s;agreeable office of communicating it to them the next morning; it was therefore agreed that he &s;hould re|main at his hou&s;e till the affair was over. They then took leave for the night, the one grieved for the lo&s;s of his young friend, whom he had loved and admired from his infancy; the other for an excellent ma&s;ter, whom he had revered and &s;erved from his cradle.</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe the &s;ituation of Clementina and Si&s;era at the phy&s;ician's recital, though he related the dreadful cir|cum&s;tance by degrees, and with the utmo&s;t caution, would beggar de&s;cription; it will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary to draw a ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l over this affecting &s;cene; and &s;uffice it to &s;ay, their grief was little &s;hort of di&s;traction. The extraordinary manner of &s;ignor Ma&s;erini's di&s;appearance left room for the mo&s;t horrid &s;uppo&s;itions, whil&s;t the faint hope which the uncertainty of his di&s;&s;olution in&s;pired, &s;erved to make each cruel idea more terrible and la&s;ting. Clementina's &s;itua|tion was, if po&s;&s;ible, more dreadful than her &s;i&s;ter's, as &s;he was in a &s;trange country, and &s;ome time gone with child. The phy&s;ician acted like a father to them both, and declar|ed,
<PB N="49" REF="035833_0050_10093CB3881BD610">
that while he lived they &s;hould never want a friend.</P>
<P>The wonderful event of &s;ignor Ma&s;erini's di&s;apearance was &s;oon &s;pread over the country. Gra&s;ville Abbey was now become a place of much greater terror than before, as tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions of its being haunted &s;eemed in all proba|bility to be confirmed; none of the pea&s;ants would go near it after dark; in &s;hort, every inhabitant was &s;urpri&s;ed and terrified.</P>
<P>Six weeks had not elap&s;ed, before &s;ignor Ma&s;erini's uncle died; the fortune now devolved to his &s;i&s;ter: a more lucky circum&s;tance could not have happened, as &s;he would have it in her power to &s;upport Clementina and her&s;elf in a gen|teel and comfortable manner, without remaining under the lea&s;t obligation to any one in point of pecuniary aid; and the phy&s;ician undertook to &s;ettle tho&s;e affairs relative to the old gentleman's death.</P>
<P>In a little time, every thing was completed, and &s;he found her&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of not only a moderate, but af|fluent income. Signora Ma&s;erini now determi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to make the life of her &s;i&s;ter-in-law as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible; &s;he knew that Clementina wi&s;hed much to return to her own country; nor had Si&s;era any de&s;ire to remain in Italy, where every object reminded her of her late misfortunes; &s;he therefore re&s;olved, after Clementina was brought to bed, to con&s;ult if &s;ome method could not be taken to clear her innocence in re&s;pect to Felicia's death, and a reconcilia|tion brought about with the lady abbe&s;s, &s;o that they could, without impropriety, re&s;ide totally in France.</P>
<P>Clementina was delivered of twins, a boy and girl. For &s;ome time her life was de&s;paired of, although the judg|ment of the phy&s;ician and the tenderne&s;s of Si&s;era were equally exerted towards her recovery; but in &s;ix weeks, to
<PB N="50" REF="035833_0051_10093C6B0E5A5CB8">
the joy of both, &s;he &s;o far mended as to be pronounced out of danger.</P>
<P>Signora Ma&s;erini now re&s;olved to a&s;k the doctor's opinion concerning their appearance in France. He offered to go him&s;elf to the convent of N****, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ettle with her lady&s;hip tho&s;e di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances that had cau&s;ed her di&s;plea&s;ure</P>
<P>Si&s;era returned him many thanks, and accepted his friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They, however, re&s;olved to let Cle|mentina know nothing of it, till the bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed: an excu&s;e was therefore made for his leaving Italy, and his journey to France &s;aid to be on account of family affairs, which he had to tran&s;act in that country.&mdash;He was &s;o fortu|nate as to return in a very &s;hort time, with the agreeable intelligence, that Clementina's character was entirely clear|ed, re&s;pecting her &s;i&s;ter's death, and all their affairs &s;ettled at the convent, in an amicable manner.&mdash;This gave Cle|mentina as much plea&s;ure as it was po&s;&s;ible for her to enjoy; every thing was ready in a few weeks; the parting with the phy&s;ician was affecting on both &s;ides; to &s;peak of their obligations to him would, they knew, be the only way to make him repent of his goodne&s;s:&mdash;they were there|fore nece&s;&s;itated to expre&s;s their gratitude in as few words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>A hou&s;e was prepared for them in a private part of Paris, and every thing made ready for their reception.&mdash;In this &s;tate they lived for &s;ome years, and enjoyed as much happi|ne&s;s as the remembrance of tho&s;e misfortunes they had &s;uffered, would permit.&mdash;The children were their greate&s;t care; they &s;erved in &s;ome degree to di&s;pel that melancholy which had taken &s;o deep a root in their bo&s;oms &s;ince &s;ignor Ma&s;erini's di&s;appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="035833_0052_10093CB51202E2B8">
Gra&s;ville Abbey remained in the &s;ame condition, except the gradual and &s;low decay of the external part: it was taken no notice of by its owner, while fear and &s;uper&s;tition prevented any interruption from tho&s;e who re&s;ided near i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.&mdash;Count D'Ollifont continued but a &s;hort time in Spain after the keys were returned; he made a tour to England, and, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed, intended to &s;ettle there.</P>

<P>Alfred and Matilda were now obliged to exert their chil|di&s;h abilities, to comfort their mother for the lo&s;s of her only friend; &s;he had often made repeated &s;olicitations to be admitted to her father's favour; but the marquis was ob&s;tinate, and complained of her elopement from the con|vent, as an excu&s;e for his cruelty.&mdash;Her whole attention was, therefore, paid to her children; and through a fond yet mi&s;taken notion, &s;he impaired her income, by giving them an education far &s;uperior to any &s;ituation in life &s;he could ever hope to procure them; they, however, rewarded her love in the tenderne&s;s of their conduct towards her, and the quickne&s;s of their capacity in receiving tho&s;e in&s;tructions that were given them.</P>
<P>Alfred already &s;howed a wi&s;h for the army; his mother determined not to check his inclinations, though &s;he dreaded the dangers he might be expo&s;ed to:&mdash;&s;he there|fore purcha&s;ed a commi&s;&s;ion for him, and he &s;oon after de|parted for Flanders, where the regiment was &s;tationed.</P>
<P>Madame Ma&s;erini had never informed her children of the
<PB N="52" REF="035833_0053_10093C6EE9386610">
dreadful manner in which their father di&s;appeared; &s;he con&s;idered it might impre&s;s their young minds with a hor|ror which might ca&s;t a gloom over the brighter &s;cenes of life; they were therefore always taught to believe &s;igner Ma&s;erini was killed by a fall from his hor&s;e, when hunt|ing; nor was there any probability to &s;uppo&s;e the real cau&s;e would ever be di&s;covered to them, as neither Clementina nor Si&s;era had informed any one to the con|trary.</P>
<P>About &s;ix months after her &s;on's departure, madame Ma&s;erini was taken ill; for &s;ome time it was thought only a &s;light di&s;order, but afterwards confirmed to be dange|rous.&mdash;The mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians were procured; but their exertions proved fruitle&s;s.&mdash;She now wi&s;hed to com|municate to her &s;on that which &s;he had &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly kept from him; &s;he determined, however, not to relate it to Matilda, as the &s;urpri&s;e and &s;hock would be too great for her; this cau&s;ed madame Ma&s;erini to wi&s;h &s;o much to &s;ee Alfred, which was before mentioned; he did not, however, arrive till her di&s;&s;olution.</P>

<P>This was Alfred's argument to his &s;i&s;ter, as he tenderly conjured her to moderate her grief, and look upon him not only as a brother, but as a guardian and protector.</P>
<P>They both had ju&s;t entered their twentieth year. Al|fred was in his per&s;on hand&s;ome and manly; Matilda beautiful and delicate.

<P>Madame Ma&s;erini had wrote &s;o far, when &s;he dropped her pen, and expired.</P>
<P>Alfred was almo&s;t petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment and hor|ror; the fatal name, &s;o near being known, was not yet re|vealed: his mother's &s;en&s;es might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the time be deran|ged; but this idea entirely vani&s;hed, when he con&s;idered how much &s;he had wi&s;hed to &s;ee him, on account of relat|ing a circum&s;tance &s;he cho&s;e to communicate to no other per&s;on. He re&s;olved for the pre&s;ent to conceal this from his &s;i&s;ter; &s;he had already &s;uffered enough by her mo|ther's death: to inform her, therefore, of the contents of the writing, would only occa&s;ion new &s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The next morning Matilda eagerly inquired the purport of her mother's letter: &s;he was &s;hocked to &s;ee him look &s;o ill, but naturally &s;uppo&s;ed he had not re&s;ted well. Alfred told her it was a memorandum relative to her fortune, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> other matters; but &s;he ob&s;erved in him an uncommon agitation the whole evening, yet forbore to inquire further, though &s;he was certain there was &s;ome di&s;agreeable &s;ecret he did not choo&s;e to divulge.</P>
<P>Alfred gave orders for his mother's funeral, and had her hand&s;omely interred. He then con&s;ulted with his &s;i&s;ter in what manner &s;he meant to proceed with the &s;mall &s;um &s;he was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. Madame Ma&s;erini had equally divided her fortune between them, but always particularly recommended Matilda to her brother's care; he therefore generou&s;ly determined to add half of his to his &s;i&s;ter's in|come,

but fir&s;t wi&s;hed to &s;ettle her in &s;ome genteel &s;itua|tion before he returned to his regiment.</P>
<P>Alfred, after &s;ome per&s;ua&s;ions, promi&s;ed Matilda he would write to the marquis of ****, their grandfather, to inform him of his daughter's death, and her &s;ituation. She con&s;idered, as lady Eleanor had been dead &s;ome time, and his hopes concerning her marriage entirely at an end, that he might receive her with &s;ome degree of tenderne&s;s, though he never would look upon their mother.</P>
<P>The young &s;oldier felt him&s;elf hurt, to write a letter of &s;upplication to a man who had behaved &s;o inhumanly to his own daughter, and &s;lightingly to him&s;elf and &s;i&s;ter; however, the idea of Matilda's welfare quenched tho&s;e &s;parks of pride which had before kindled in his bo|&s;om.</P>
<P>About a week after madame Ma&s;erini's funeral, he &s;ent the following letter, in which might be ob&s;erved a kind of inward di&s;dain, not likely to move or gain upon the feel|ings of a man &s;o utterly void of &s;en&s;ibility as the marquis.</P>

<P>MADAME Ma&s;erini had received repeated &s;olicitations from her relation to vi&s;it him in London; &s;he, according|ly, a few months after Si&s;era's death, determined to &s;ee England, con&s;idering it might di&s;pel the melancholy that event had occa&s;ioned her: the children &s;he committed to the care of a faithful &s;ervant, during her &s;tay, which was about two months. Mr. Peviquil had not then quit|ted bu&s;ine&s;s. She received the mo&s;t polite and friend|ly attention both from him and his lady, and re&s;ided totally at their hou&s;e while &s;he remained in this country. She always &s;ince that time had &s;poken of them to Alfred and Matilda, as people well worthy their e&s;teem, and had often regretted their living &s;o far di&s;tant as to make their &s;ociety impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Since his mother's death, Alfred had received a letter of condolence from &s;ir Peter, who had accidentally heard the
<PB N="60" REF="035833_0061_10093C7AE96D7800">
news from a friend; this letter contained a kind and pre&s;|&s;ing invitation for them to &s;pend a few months in Eng|land: which offer they were now re&s;olved to accept, pro|vided Alfred could obtain leave of ab&s;ence long enough, and permi&s;&s;ion to quit his country. This, through inte|re&s;t, he accompli&s;hed, on condition he &s;hould be ready to return at a &s;hort notice.</P>
<P>Matilda, little u&s;ed to the gaiety of the world, though &s;he had nearly all her life re&s;ided in a city renowned for its luxury &amp; di&s;&s;ipation, con&s;idered that if &s;he was plea&s;ed with &s;ir Peter's family, by paying a &s;mall gratuity &s;he could re&s;ide with them without any inconvenience. This was, in &s;ome degree, Alfred's opinion; but he was much better ac|quainted with mankind, and the dangers that attended a fa&s;hionable life, to view this &s;cheme in &s;o plea&s;ing a light as his &s;i&s;ter. He well knew the di&s;&s;ipated life of intrigue, and other vices, &s;o clo&s;ely followed by mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h circles; he had been nece&s;&s;itated, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to par|take of tho&s;e follies in Paris, which he knew were daily practi&s;ed in London; and his &s;oul &s;ickened at the thought of leaving Matilda expo&s;ed to &s;uch dangers, friendle&s;s and unprotected. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that nice &s;en&s;e of honour which is &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute the &s;oldier and the gentleman, it in &s;ome re&s;pect &s;erved to make his life uncomfortable. Generous to a great degree, he was never &s;o happy as when he could make others &s;o; but a haughty and &s;tubborn pride hurt him when he received an obligation. Ready to take an affront, and as ready to re&s;ent it, he was &s;ome|times di&s;agreeable company; yet his per&s;on, behaviour, and character, procured him admittance to the fir&s;t parties.</P>
<P>Matilda was totally unacquainted with the vices of the great; her mother had only kept up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ociety of a few friends &s;ince her return to France; yet her manners were
<PB N="61" REF="035833_0062_10093CC5A36EB978">
elegant without affectation; her deportment graceful, yet ea&s;y; and her accompli&s;hments by no means inferior to the fir&s;t ranks of life. Yet her ideas of the world in gen|eral were entirely ill founded: &s;he judged of others by her&s;elf, and had &s;o little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">otion of the villainy of mankind, as to be ea&s;ily deceived by any one under the ma&s;k of flat|tery and di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>After &s;ome per&s;ua&s;ions of his &s;i&s;ter, Alfred determined to an&s;wer &s;ir Peter's letter, with an acceptance of his kind invitation. The &s;ame day month was fixed for their de|parture; and that period of time was fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led up with ne|ce&s;&s;ary preparations for their journey.</P>
<P>Matilda was all expectation, yet a deep melancholy &s;till clouded her future pro&s;pects; the lo&s;s of her mother prey|ed much on her &s;pirits; and while her eye beamed plea|&s;ure at the idea of &s;eeing London and gay life, a watery gem would oft intrude, and dim its lu&s;tre, when &s;he con&s;idered the di&s;tance &s;he &s;hould be from the tomb of a parent whom &s;he had &s;o dearly loved, and who&s;e memory &s;he &s;o much revered. Alfred was &s;ilent and thoughtful; his &s;pirits were fled; the contents of the paper written by his mother &s;erved to perplex and di&s;tre&s;s him, while his anxie|ty for the welfare of his &s;i&s;ter continually preyed upon his mind. As the time drew nearer for their leaving Paris, he became le&s;s plea&s;ed with the plan on which they were going to proceed. He had always heard his mother &s;peak highly of the family; but their &s;ituation in life at that time was entirely different from the pre&s;ent.&mdash;Tho' in a capital <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of bu&s;ine&s;s, they neither were con&s;idered, nor looked upon them&s;elves&punc; as people of fa&s;hion; their manner of living, as he now under&s;tood, was one continual &s;cene of gaiety and di&s;&s;ipation. Tho&s;e reports might be fal&s;e; and
<PB N="62" REF="035833_0063_100937C8B7A4FEC0">
on their being &s;o, he entirely placed his hopes re|&s;pecting Matilda's making one of their family.</P>
<P>Sir Peter's letter was extremely friendly; to have refu&s;ed what he &s;o earne&s;tly reque&s;ted, would not only have been impolite behaviour, but would, without doubt, have offend|ed him.&mdash;This mode of rea&s;oning, in &s;ome degree, le&s;&s;en|ed his di&s;quietude; yet he re&s;olved within him&s;elf not to leave his &s;i&s;ter in England, without being certain her &s;itua|tion was &s;trictly accordant both with propriety and honour.</P>
<P>The day of their departure at length arrived,&mdash;Matilda, as they pa&s;&s;ed through the gates of the city, bid a melan|choly adieu to her native country.&mdash;The recollection of tho&s;e happy juvenile hours &s;he had enjoyed with a parent who&s;e tenderne&s;s and maternal fondne&s;s &s;he never more could experience, added to her ideas of the friendle&s;s &s;itua|tion and unprotected condition &s;he would be left in when parted from her brother, entirely overcame that fortitude &s;he had &s;hewn at the beginning of their journey; and, almo&s;t convul&s;ed with grief, &s;he bur&s;t into an agony of tears.</P>
<P>Alfred rai&s;ed his head from a reverie which he had been in from their fir&s;t &s;etting off; he conjured his &s;i&s;ter to be compo&s;ed, and once more tenderly a&s;&s;ured her of his pro|tection.&mdash;A po&s;t carriage conveyed them from Paris to Calais; an elderly man attended them, who had lived in the capacity of a &s;ervant with their mother, &s;ince the death of Edward; he was by birth an Engli&s;hman, though he chiefly had re&s;ided in France.</P>
<P>They were nece&s;&s;itated to wait &s;ome time for the packet-boat; Matilda, therefore, who was much indi&s;po&s;ed, re|tired to take a few hours' re&s;t, while Alfred looked over &s;ome papers of his mother's, which were in a &s;mall trunk.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="035833_0064_10093CC89AB65D18">
Matilda had not yet examined it, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be full of wa&s;te papers, which were of no con&s;equence; &s;he only brought it with her to hold a few articles of dre&s;s when &s;he arrived in London.</P>
<P>After having removed a few of the upper papers, he di&s;|covered a miniature of his mother; it was the &s;ame which Edward found in the abbey, and had the identical piece of ribband hanging to the ring, the remaining part of which had &s;eemingly been broken by force, or by a &s;udden &s;hock. Alfred looked on the re&s;emblance with attention; he con|templated the features of his departed mother, with a me|lancholy plea&s;ure, and &s;ighed at the idea that he never more &s;hould look on the original.&mdash;Clo&s;e to it was the picture of his father.&mdash;Alfred had always been told he was extremely like him, and for the fir&s;t time thought &s;o him&s;elf.&mdash;Both he and his &s;i&s;ter had often &s;een the miniatures before their mother's illne&s;s, and after her death every place was &s;earch|ed for them, but to no purpo&s;e; nor had they the lea&s;t idea of their being placed in this trunk.</P>
<P>Alfred carefully looked over the papers, and found none of them worth notice, till he had nearly emptied them all out upon the table, when a roll of parchment, with the name of Si&s;era Ma&s;erini at the bottom, &s;truck his eye. He immediately peru&s;ed it, and found it was written by his aunt, about &s;ix months before her death.&mdash;It contained an account of their misfortunes, from his father's fir&s;t &s;eeing his mother at the convent, till their return to France, and every minute particular relative to &s;ignor Ma&s;erini's en|trance of Gra&s;ville Abbey, and his di&s;appearance. She al&s;o at one part &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pect his cou&s;in, count D'Ollifont, to be privy to the affair, though he was then in Spain.</P>
<P>Alfred's emotion and a&s;toni&s;hment were pa&s;t de&s;cription; he burnt with eager de&s;ire to &s;ee the in&s;ide of the abbey;
<PB N="64" REF="035833_0065_10093C7E20272BB0">
but that would now be impo&s;&s;ible, till he &s;hould return to France. He knew not how to revenge the lo&s;s of his fa|ther, as no proof could be brought to charge any one with the guilt;&mdash;yet, according to what he had read, he could not avoid &s;uppo&s;ing that the count was concerned: nor was there a doubt but his mother al&s;o intended to have written the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>He carefully placed the manu&s;cript in a private drawer of his own, and determined not to inform his &s;i&s;ter of the event, as her &s;pirits were already agitated enough, without any new &s;ource for horror of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>When &s;he ro&s;e, he agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed her by the di&s;covery of the pictures, and informed her he had looked over the papers in the trunk, and could find none but frivolous frag|ments of no u&s;e or con&s;equence.</P>
<P>They were obliged to remain at the place till the begin|ning of the next day; they then cro&s;&s;ed over to Dover, and &s;lept there that night. Matilda was yet much indi&s;po&s;ed, partly occa&s;ioned by &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s. The next evening, after a fatiguing day of po&s;t travelling, they found them&s;elves at a principal inn at London.</P>

<P>WHEN the &s;oul is totally ab&s;orbed in melancholy re|flections on pa&s;t misfortunes, we are too apt to encourage
<PB N="65" REF="035833_0066_10093CCA20392540">
oppre&s;&s;ive ideas, by taking a retro&s;pect of the calamiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s that may attend futurity.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas &s;ink our &s;pirits under new horrors and di&s;|tre&s;s; imagination pre&s;ents to the fancy troubles and &s;or|rows we are never likely to experience.</P>
<P>To be too confident of our &s;ucce&s;s and abilities at the fir&s;t out-&s;et in life, naturally leads to extravagance and ne|glect; we are di&s;appointed at our ambition's not being gratified &s;o early as we expected, and con&s;equently &s;icken of that employment which occa&s;ions our mortification and chagrin. Yet diffidence and timidity are far wor&s;e com|panions to &s;truggle with through the rugged path of life: we continually &s;tumble on dangers and vexations in our hazardous voyage; while they chiefly contribute to multi|ply adver&s;ity, and paint the events that may &s;ucceed, wor&s;e than tho&s;e we have already &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Fortitude for&s;akes the brea&s;t which is governed by ter|ror and &s;elf-intere&s;t; happine&s;s is no more, the &s;un-&s;hine of hope is eclip&s;ed by the heavy clouds of de&s;pair, and we &s;ink into that mi&s;ery which, through courage and exertion, we might have overcome with honour and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Matilda did not totally de&s;pair: and Alfred, by conver|&s;ations of this nature, &s;trove to di&s;pel that melancholy which was &s;ettled in her features during the latter part of their journey. It was entirely through her per&s;ua&s;ion that her brother undertook the affair; &s;he was now &s;orry &s;he had bia&s;&s;ed his opinion; for &s;he even regretted leaving Paris; and the nearer &s;he arrived to London, her plea&s;ure in &s;eeing it gradually decrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Reflection had in a great degree le&s;&s;ened tho&s;e expecta|tions &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed would be gratified when &s;he entered this city; and the romantic ideas &s;he had formed of re|maining with &s;ir Peter's family in England, &s;eemed now to have many ob&s;tacles which &s;he never before thought of.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="035833_0067_10093C81D93016F0">
It was about &s;ix o'clock, in a wet uncomfortable evening of February, when they arrived at the inn. After &s;ome little time, the chief part of their baggage was put into a hackney coach, and Leonard, who was tolerably well ac|quainted with London, di&s;patched in it to Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, with a polite me&s;&s;age, &s;aying his ma&s;ter and mi&s;s Ma&s;erini would pay their re&s;pects in per&s;on, in le&s;s than two hours.</P>
<P>Alfred and Matilda, having ordered coffee, remained till near eight; during which time they made &s;ome little alteration in their dre&s;s. They then &s;tept into a hack, and ordered it al&s;o to drive to &s;ir Peter Peviquil's, in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare.</P>
<P>Neither of them was under any embarra&s;&s;ment concern|ing the Engli&s;h language, as they both had been u&s;ed to conver&s;e in it from their childhood, and pronounced it nearly as well as their own language.</P>
<P>On their arrival at the place to which they had ordered the coachman to drive, the &s;quare was full of carriages; nor did they ob&s;erve more than one hackney-coach in the whole train: they &s;topped clo&s;e to it, unable to proceed any farther for the crowd. Alfred looked out to &s;ee if there was any probability of their getting nearer to &s;ir Pe|ter's hou&s;e, which he was informed was on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;quare, when, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;uppri&s;e, by the light of a footman's flambeau, who pa&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time, he beheld Leonard in the coach he had before noti|ced, &s;eated with the baggage in the &s;ame &s;tate as when he &s;et out from the inn.</P>
<P>The man at the &s;ame moment recognized his ma&s;ter, and acquainted him that he found, from his fir&s;t entrance in the &s;quare it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to get to the door of &s;ir Peter's hou&s;e, there being a grand entertainment
<PB N="67" REF="035833_0068_10093CCD184B44D0">
there in honour of his daughter's birth-day; and that the gentlemen's carriages would not permit a common hack to draw up; he was afraid to go him&s;elf in &s;earch of it on account of the baggage he mu&s;t have left behind; but he &s;aid he had &s;ent &s;everal me&s;&s;ages to the &s;ervants con|cerning his &s;ituation, but that he had received no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Alfred was vexed, yet he could not help &s;miling, at the fellow's recital: they were now in a line of carriages lead|ing to the hou&s;e: he knew it would be &s;ome time before they could arrive there; yet to walk would be almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible on account of his &s;i&s;ter, as the rain poured down with uncommon violence. They therefore determined to wait till the coach, in due cour&s;e, &s;hould draw up to the door: in about twenty minutes they found them&s;elves be|fore the entrance of &s;ir Peter's man&s;ion.</P>
<P>The coachman, by Alfred's order, knocked a &s;ingle rap: a footman in a hand&s;ome livery appeared; he a&s;ked, in a &s;urly manner, what was wanted? the man an&s;wered, a gentleman in a hackney coach wanted to &s;ee &s;ir Peter Peviquil.</P>
<P>The footman replied with &s;ome in&s;olence, "His ma&s;ter could not then be &s;poke with," and immediately &s;hut the door.</P>
<P>Alfred's pride (who overheard this conver&s;ation), took fire;&mdash;he directly gave the coachman a card, and ordered him to knock a double rap at the door, and de&s;ire the &s;er|vant to deliver it to &s;ir Peter.</P>
<P>The man at fir&s;t he&s;itated, but at la&s;t complied with the reque&s;t. In a &s;hort time he returned with a polite me&s;&s;age from &s;ir Peter, reque&s;ting they would make his hou&s;e their home; and that he him&s;elf would, if po&s;&s;ible, welcome them to England in le&s;s than an hour.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="035833_0069_10093C8737DEDB40">
The &s;ervant was now all civility; both the coaches were di&s;charged, and Leonard &s;aw the baggage &s;afe in the hou&s;e, while Alfred and Matilda were conducted by &s;ir Pe|ter's valet, through a noble hall, elegantly adorned with lamps, and lined with &s;ervants in waiting, to a hand&s;ome parlour. The hou&s;e &s;eemed in total confu&s;ion; and the number of fa&s;hionable company and nobility that was there was evident from their names being announced, as they a&s;cended the great &s;tairs leading to the rooms of reception. Sir Peter's genteel conduct in &s;ome degree compen&s;ated for the impertinence of his porter, and bani&s;hed that anger from Alfred's bo&s;om, which the in&s;olence of the latter had occa&s;ioned. In about two hours the gentleman him|&s;elf appeared: he tenderly embraced them both, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed, with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing affability, his happine&s;s in &s;eeing them in London: he regretted (he &s;aid) the eti|quette which prevented lady Peviquil and his daughter from leaving the rooms above, to perform the duties o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ho&s;pitality and politene&s;s; but that he was &s;ure they would impatiently wait fot the breakfa&s;t hour in the morning, to be introduced to their amiab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> relations.</P>
<P>He, however, begged they would make them&s;elves hap|py; order &s;upper, and retire to re&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what time they thought proper, as chambers were prepared for them, and al&s;o proper accommodation for their &s;ervant.

<P>They made but a &s;hort repa&s;t, though the table was &s;pread with dainties elegantly &s;erved up; about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they de|&s;ired to be conducted to their different apartments; but the noi&s;e of the hou&s;e, and their own reflections, prevented either of them from enjoying repo&s;e.</P>

<P>THE noi&s;e and confu&s;ion in the hou&s;e did not &s;eem over before four in the morning;&mdash;Matilda heard the doors fa&s;tened half an hour after;&mdash;and about five, &s;ilence reign|ed through every part.</P>
<P>She once more &s;trove to drive away uncomfortable reflec|tions, and fell into a di&s;turbed &s;lumber: di&s;tre&s;&s;ing dreams hara&s;&s;ed her imagination with horrid vi&s;ions; the figure of her&punc; the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was con&s;tantly before her eyes, reproaching her for entering a hou&s;e remarkable for gaiety and di&s;&s;ipa|tion.</P>
<P>She awoke about t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, but little re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;hed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> up for fear of detaining the breakfa&s;t-table; but to her great &s;urpri&s;e, as &s;he de&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e, a &s;ervant was but ju&s;t opening the windows. She inquired at what hour the family a&s;&s;embled in the breakfa&s;t parlour; the man an&s;wered, generally at half pa&s;t eleven, &s;ometimes twelve.</P>
<P>Alfred had been up near an hour, and was equally a&s;ton|i&s;hed with his &s;i&s;ter, at the &s;ervant's intelligence:&mdash;he propo&s;ed a walk round the &s;quare, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;itting-rooms were in order; which &s;he gladly accepted.</P>
<P>Matilda &s;eized the opportunity to a&s;k her brother, con|&s;idering the little they had &s;een, how he liked their &s;itua|tion; and al&s;o his opinion of &s;ir Peter.</P>
<P>Alfred replied, from the &s;hort time he had been in com|pany of &s;ir Peter Peviquil, he &s;eemed to be a man who would intere&s;t any one in his favour, even at a fir&s;t inter|view.</P>
<P>"But, Matilda," &s;aid he, "we mu&s;t not depend too much on the &s;mooth, well-timed &s;peeches of a man of fa&s;hion; for though both he and the family in general were friendly and agreeable in every re&s;pect, yet their man|ner

<P>Matilda acquie&s;ced with his ob&s;ervation, yet was hurt at the idea of her own in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>In about an hour they returned to the hou&s;e; prepara|rations were made for breakfa&s;t, but the family had not a&s;|&s;embled.</P>
<P>Sir Peter, in a &s;hort time, entered the room, and intro|duced his lady, daughter, and &s;on.</P>
<P>Lady Peviquil was, in per&s;on, tall and elegant, her de|portment was graceful, and in her manner &s;he was the wo|man of fa&s;hion; yet a haughty pride in her di&s;po&s;ition was vi&s;ible, even to a common beholder, at fir&s;t &s;ight; and ca&s;t a deep &s;hade over tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which &s;howed her a lady of rank. Mi&s;s Peviquil had the day before entered her nineteenth year; &s;he was tall, genteel, lively, and good tempered; in the ornamental part of edu|cation &s;he was accompli&s;hed, but, like her mother, a total &s;tranger to dome&s;tic duties. In conver&s;ation, &s;he was gay and witty, and accounted, by the connoi&s;&s;eurs of fa&s;hion|able manners, a tolerably &s;mart, pretty girl.</P>
<P>Henry Peviquil was one-and-twenty; entirely free from pride, hand&s;ome in his per&s;on, and plea&s;ing in his beha|viour and addre&s;s; extremely di&s;&s;ipated, and fond of being thought &s;o.</P>
<P>He had received the education of a gentleman, and was left a fortune of &s;ix hundred a year by an uncle of his
<PB N="71" REF="035833_0072_10093CD514C5A850">
mother's. He was &s;hortly expected to &s;et out on the grand tour, and only waited till a proper companion could be obtained.</P>
<P>The young travellers were treated in the mo&s;t friendly manner by &s;ir Peter. Lady Peviquil, her daughter, and Matilda, took an airing in the coach; while Henry drove his new friend round Hyde Park in his curricle.</P>
<P>Cards were delivered out to form a &s;elect party of friends in the evening, who were to be introduced to the young foreigners.</P>
<P>At their return, they dre&s;&s;ed for dinner, which was &s;erv|ed up by candle-light. The &s;elect party at night con&s;i&s;ted of about thirty per&s;ons of fa&s;hion and di&s;tinction. The formal introduction to them all by her lady&s;hip, was tire|&s;ome and di&s;agreeable to Matilda: yet &s;he returned the compliments of each individual with a grace which did honor even to the drawing-room of &s;ir Peter Peviquil.</P>
<P>Alfred had been u&s;ed to the gaieties of Paris, and being as well ver&s;ed as his &s;i&s;ter in the Engli&s;h language, found him&s;elf under no embarra&s;&s;ment in a London company.</P>
<P>The next day he declared his intention of taking lodg|ings for him&s;elf and &s;ervant; this was &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by &s;ir Peter; but he per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution, and beg|ged the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Peviquil in the undertaking. Henry, with his u&s;ual good-nature, eagerly complied with the reque&s;t, and declared, he knew of hand&s;ome apart|ments that were to be let in Bond-&s;treet; which was no great di&s;tance from Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, and made it the more agreeable, as &s;ir Peter reque&s;ted he would &s;pend as much of his time as po&s;&s;ible with him and his family.</P>
<P>The gentlemen viewed the rooms that morning, while the ladies attended a mu&s;ic-meeting. Alfred approved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their &s;ituation and convenience; he immediately
<PB N="72" REF="035833_0073_10093C8DA14A3398">
engaged them, and was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the next day.</P>
<P>Henry Peviquil was engaged for the beginning of the even|ing, and &s;ir Peter rather indi&s;po&s;ed with a cold; it was therefore agreed that Alfred &s;hould e&s;cort her lady&s;hip, his &s;i&s;ter, and mi&s;s Peviquil to the theatre; and a &s;tage-box was accordingly retained for them.</P>
<P>Matilda was delighted with the tragedy, which was Hamlet: although her knowledge of the language would not permit her to under&s;tand every &s;entence, yet &s;he could perfectly make out the plot and management of the piece; and was charmed with the ingenuity of the author. Her lady&s;hip paid more attention to the company than to the &s;tage; while her daughter was entirely taken up in ob|&s;erving Alfred, who&s;e attention was fixed on a lady in the oppo&s;ite box. Her figure and manner charmed him; in &s;hort, the latter part of the evening he quite neglected the performance, in the notice he took of the fair incognita.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the entertainment, Alfred inquired of lady Peviquil the name of the young lady oppo&s;ite them: her lady&s;hip an&s;wered, "It was lady Caroline Albourn, daughter of lord Albourn, a nobleman renowned for his large fortune and good character; and, lady Caroline," con|tinued her lady&s;hip, "is allowed to be a beautiful and ac|compli&s;hed young lady." "My ideas, my lady." returned Alfred, "perfectly agree, in the former ob&s;ervation, with the opinion of the world."</P>
<P>"Lord, Mr. Ma&s;erini," &s;aid mi&s;s Peviquil, hurt at the compliment paid to another, "&s;urely there are as hand|&s;ome women in the hou&s;e as lady Caroline Albourn!"</P>
<P>"Pardon me, madam," replied Alfred, "all are hand|&s;ome; yet &s;ome more beautiful than others; nor can the remark be more fully exemplified, than when lady Caroline or mi&s;s Peviquil make their appearance."</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="035833_0074_10093CD88D58CF20">
This well turned compliment entirely &s;tifled the re&s;ent|ment of the lady, and &s;he immediately re&s;umed her u&s;ual gaiety and good temper.</P>
<P>As they cro&s;&s;ed the lobby, they were met by Henry Pevi|quil, who, after helping Alfred to a&s;&s;i&s;t the ladies to their coach, &s;topped him from following.</P>
<P>"Ladies," &s;aid he, "I mu&s;t reque&s;t you will di&s;pen&s;e with the company of your knight-errant from conducting you home, as I arre&s;t him for the remainder of the night. Therefore, my dear Ma&s;erini, take leave of the fair dam|&s;els, and follow me."</P>
<P>Alfred begged to be excu&s;ed, and de&s;ired he would con|&s;ider there were none but ladies in the coach.</P>
<P>"Oh!" returned Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, "there is a footman behind, who is able to defend twice as many."</P>
<P>"I do not take it kind of you," &s;aid her lady&s;hip, "to force Mr. Ma&s;erini from us, if you do not like to at|tend your&s;elf."</P>
<P>Matilda was anxious her brother &s;hould return with them, and mi&s;s Peviquil afraid of lo&s;ing the gallant con|ver&s;ation of the young Frenchman: but it availed no|thing: Henry, after begging all their pardons, and declar|ing he would make it up with them in the morning, clo&s;ed the coach door, and ordered the coachman to drive home.</P>
<P>He then &s;aid hold of Alfred's arm and told him he mu&s;t now introduce him to a &s;et of friends, who&s;e names he did not chu&s;e to mention before the ladies: "for though," &s;aid he, "I am not a game&s;ter my&s;elf, yet I &s;pend &s;ome of my time in the fa&s;hionable company of tho&s;e who love play."</P>
<P>Alfred was rather di&s;plea&s;ed at his impetuous beha|viour; but con&s;idered it as the warmth of his friend&s;hip,
<PB N="74" REF="035833_0075_10093C909A7B30A8">
and the con&s;equence of his having partaken that evening rather too freely of the bottle.</P>
<P>They arrived, after &s;ome time, at a well known hou&s;e in St. James's-&s;treet, and were conducted to the room of fa&s;hionable company.</P>
<P>Alfred was &s;truck with their appearance: the horrid countenances of &s;ome, whom fortune had not &s;o favoured that evening&mdash;the intoxicated joy of others who had emp|tied the pockets of their friends&mdash;and the extreme agita|tion of the whole a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e expectations were all on the table, made it a &s;cene of di&s;agreeable reflection to tho&s;e who had never been addicted to that de&s;tructive vice. Alfred plainly perceived his companion was well known to them; he was a&s;ked to play, but refu&s;ed; and Alfred likewi&s;e begged to remain out, but was obliged to bet, that he might not &s;eem particular, as all tho&s;e who did not &s;it down, laid on the &s;ucce&s;s of each player: but the &s;takes were not large at their part of the room.</P>
<P>In about an hour a table was vacant, and a party accor|dingly mu&s;tered to fill it. Alfred was over per&s;uaded, and &s;at down with Henry Peviquil, who propo&s;ed no high play: this was unanimou&s;ly agreed upon, and a &s;mall &s;um &s;ettled, to the &s;atisfaction of every per&s;on. They broke up in about three hours, and Alfred found him&s;elf a win|ner of about a guinea. He was complim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ted on his judgment of the game, and invited for the next evening. Henry and Alfred both returned to Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, and arrived there about four in the morning.</P>
<P>When the family met the next day, Henry Peviquil made his peace with the ladies; but he found more difficulty in the undertaking than he expected: his mother and &s;i&s;ter were &s;eriou&s;ly offended; nor could Matilda forgive him, though &s;he was nece&s;&s;itated to &s;ay to the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="035833_0076_10093CDA19FB42A8">
Alfred was far from being di&s;plea&s;ed with the company he had &s;een; &s;truck as he was at fir&s;t with their appear|ance, the latter part of the time they &s;eemed more agreea|able to him; and their ready acquie&s;cence to play for a &s;mall &s;um, confirmed him in the mi&s;taken opinion that they were not a common cla&s;s of gamblers. He was not aver&s;e to meet them the following evening, nor did morning re|flection by any means alter his ideas concerning the tran&s;actions of the night.</P>
<P>Lady Peviquil informed them, &s;he had &s;ummoned a nu|merous company for that evening, "and among&s;t the re&s;t," added her lady&s;hip, with a &s;mile, which was well under|&s;tood, "I expect lord Albourn and his daughter."</P>
<P>Alfred was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;he had engaged him&s;elf to the party in St. James's-&s;treet; but this ob&s;ta|cle to his wi&s;hes he determined to &s;urmount, by begging Henry Peviquil to make his excu&s;e, as he could not po&s;&s;ibly be guilty of &s;uch impolite behaviour, as to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from lady Peviquil's drawing-room, when &s;he her&s;elf re|que&s;ted his company.&mdash;But he might have &s;aved him&s;elf the trouble, as Henry intended to &s;pend the fore-part of the evening in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare; yet he in&s;i&s;ted on Al|fred's accompanying him there, after the rooms clo&s;ed, which he &s;uppo&s;ed would not be very late.</P>

<P>MATILDA took more pains than u&s;ual at the toilet: &s;he under&s;tood from lady Peviquil that numbers of fa&s;hion|able people were to be there; &s;he therefore con&s;idered it would be a compliment to her lady&s;hip to make &s;ome few additions to her dre&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ted of white &s;atin. She
<PB N="76" REF="035833_0077_10093C9221954E28">
wore the picture of her father &s;u&s;pended on her bo&s;om, by a gold cro&s;s and chain; her appearance was beautiful, and &s;he received no &s;mall compliments from &s;ir Peter and his &s;on. Lady Peviquil and her daughter were rather cool in their behaviour, and &s;eemed envious of her &s;uperi|or beauty and elegance. The rooms began to fill at nine o'clock, and many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction were announced: among the re&s;t the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador was u&s;hered in, and begged to introduce to &s;ir Peter and his lady, an inti|mate friend, who had accompanied him from Spain to England. The gentleman was a foreigner of note, rather in the decline of life; yet his per&s;on was hand&s;ome, and his manners elegant and accompli&s;hed: his excellency had not yet been made known to Alfred or Matilda; &s;ir Peter therefore introduced them both at one time, the fir&s;t as the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, the &s;econd as count D'Ollifont.</P>
<P>Alfred was &s;truck motionle&s;s with horror and &s;urpri&s;e; the &s;uppo&s;ed murderer of his father &s;tood before him: nor was the count's embarra&s;&s;ment le&s;s; for before &s;ir Peter could mention the name of Ma&s;erini, he ca&s;t his eye on the picture of their father; his countenance immedi|ately turned pale, and he &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wed the greate&s;t emotion.</P>
<P>Matilda, though &s;he had never heard her mother &s;peak highly of the count, received him with politene&s;s; but Alfred, after a few cold compliments, joined lord Albourn and his daughter at another part of the room.</P>
<P>The behaviour of both gentlemen was generally noticed: but each excu&s;ed him&s;elf, by &s;aying it was &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;udden introduction to a relation almo&s;t unknown.</P>
<P>The count &s;eemed &s;truck with Matilda's figure and ad|dre&s;s; he chiefly attended her the whole evening; which cau&s;ed great envy and unea&s;ine&s;s in the brea&s;ts of her fair friends; among the&s;e was mi&s;s Peviquil, who was ex|tremely hurt at being for&s;aken by Alfred Ma&s;erini, and
<PB N="77" REF="035833_0078_10093CDD183CBA28">
more &s;o at receiving &s;uch few compliments from the am|ba&s;&s;ador and his friend.</P>
<P>Alfred dedicated the whole evening to lady Caroline, nor did &s;he &s;eem by any means di&s;plea&s;ed at the attention paid her by the young Frenchman; her father gave him a general invitation to Soho-&s;quare, as the friend and re|lation of &s;ir Peter Peviquil.</P>
<P>The agreeable conver&s;ation he had with the young la|dy, in &s;ome mea&s;ure made up for the &s;urpri&s;e, horror, and di&s;&s;atisfaction be felt at an introduction to the count.</P>
<P>The attention paid Matilda by her relation did not pa&s;s unnoticed by her brother; he determined next day to hint to his &s;i&s;ter his di&s;like of him, without entering into a particular de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail of circum&s;tances, which would only di&s;|tre&s;s and perplex her.</P>
<P>The rooms began to be thin about twelve; and in a lit|tle time after, lord Albourn and his daughter took their leave; Alfred conducted the latter to her carriage, then joined Henry Peviquil, and proceeded to St. James's &s;treet.</P>
<P>The &s;ame company was a&s;&s;embled, with &s;ome additions: and one of the &s;trangers was at the table where Henry and his friend were placed; they played higher than the night before, and Alfred, at the breaking up of the party about half pa&s;t four in the morning, found him&s;elf a lo&s;er of thirty pounds; he paid the money without the lea&s;t chagrin, and was promi&s;ed his revenge the next evening. Henry Peviquil was al&s;o declared a debtor to the table, of twenty guineas. They parted a little way from the hou&s;e; the latter for Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, the former for his new lodgings in Bond-&s;treet.</P>
<P>Matilda had taken notice of her brother at his intro|duction to the count, nor could &s;he conceive a rea&s;on for his abrupt behaviour; her &s;urpri&s;e, however, was greatly
<PB N="78" REF="035833_0079_10093D31AA403538">
heightened at the &s;lighting manner in which he &s;poke of him, when they were alone the following day. In vain &s;he a&s;ked his meaning for the di&s;like he &s;howed; the more they conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject, his conver&s;ation ap|peared the more &s;trange and intricate. His ideas al&s;o &s;eemed entirely changed concerning their re&s;idence in London; her fears of di&s;&s;ipation and bad hours he laugh|ed at; declared him&s;elf plea&s;ed with &s;ir Peter's family; and would not permit her to mention a wi&s;h of leaving it.</P>
<P>Alfred was a con&s;tant attendant at lord Albourn's, the fore part of the day; the latter he generally &s;pent in the gay family of &s;ir Peter; and the night and beginning of the morning at the gaming table: he was now univer&s;al|ly known as a man of fa&s;hion, and his name familiar in the fir&s;t circles, as the di&s;&s;ipated, lively, and hand&s;ome Frenchman.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter &s;aw, with concern, the effects of their Lon|don journey; &s;he could plainly ob&s;erve her brother's for|tune would be &s;oon exhau&s;ted, in the manner he lived: his character, as a gambler, was con&s;tantly made free with, and his midnight exploits and quarrels commonly mentioned in general conver&s;ations. Her own &s;ituation was al&s;o particularly di&s;agreeable. Harra&s;&s;ed by the a&s;&s;i|duities of the count and many other admirers, &s;he was continually plagued with their importunities and flattery. Lady Peviquil had entirely thrown off the few amiable qualities &s;he &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s; and being further ac|quainted with her circum&s;tances and friendle&s;s &s;ituation, &s;he treated her little better than a dependant on her bounty.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Peviquil hated her for her beauty, and was hardly civil; in vain Matilda begged her brother to leave England, and return to France; he laughed at her com|plaints:
<PB N="79" REF="035833_0080_10093CE1206B4548">
&s;he reque&s;ted him only to conduct her there, and &s;he would immediately place her&s;elf in a convent, and cau&s;e him no further trouble:&mdash;but her &s;olicitations were vain; the de&s;tructive vice of gaming had already taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him: every ob&s;tacle, difficulty, and intere&s;t, vani&s;hed before it; even the welfare of his &s;i&s;ter, the ho|nour of his family, the treatment of his father, and the de|&s;ire he had to &s;ee Gra&s;ville Abbey, were thought of no more, when the gaming table appeared; lady Caroline was almo&s;t forgot; in &s;hort, every &s;entiment of fortitude, courage, and humanity, with other virtues which &s;tamped on him the name of a gentleman and a &s;oldier, were al|mo&s;t &s;wallowed up in a cur&s;ed infatuation for a fa&s;hiona|ble vice.</P>
<P>Sir Peter, who was entirely governed by his lady, paid hardly any attention to his fair relation:&mdash;the whole fa|mily treated her with the utmo&s;t indifference, except Henry Peviquil:&mdash;his gallantry, like that of the count, was en|tirely di&s;gu&s;ting; and the mo&s;t villanious views appeared under the ma&s;k of friendly concern and pity for her &s;itu|ation; he would often hint his knowledge of her circum|&s;tances&punc; and the extravagance of her brother; which ex|travagance he fir&s;t introduced him to:&mdash;his di&s;cour&s;e would then turn into violent prote&s;tations of his regard for her, and admiration of her beauty and accompli&s;h|ments.</P>
<P>Before Alfred, he &s;howed no further &s;igns of particularity in his behaviour than what common politene&s;s required. Affairs were in this &s;tate, when one evening, at a grand ball given by lady Peviquil, a &s;tranger was introduced un|der the name of Milverne, an only &s;on of a lord of that name: he was ju&s;t arrived from Italy, where he had at|tended his father, who was in a declining &s;tate of health:
<PB N="80" REF="035833_0081_10093D346BD0A8D8">
his elegant figure and agreeable manners were univer&s;ally noticed;&mdash;he was reque&s;ted to open the entertainment with a minuet, and a lady was al&s;o fixed on for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pur|po&s;e; but the latter being rather indi&s;po&s;ed, declined the ceremony and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> attending on &s;ingle dancing: the young gentleman was therefore obliged to take another partner, and he immediately reque&s;ted the hand of Matil|da: prai&s;es were whi&s;pered through every part of the room, at the elegance and grace of the young performers: nor did Mr. Milverne's attention end here; he continued among the crowd of her admirers the whole evening, and greatly interrupted the &s;oft &s;peeches of the count.</P>
<P>Alfred danced with lady Caroline: but he was by no means &s;o great a favourite with his lord&s;hip as at their fir&s;t interviews; nor did he &s;eem plea&s;ed with his daugh|ter's re&s;igning her hand to him as a partner: lady Caro|line her&s;elf appeared much attached to him; and Matilda thought &s;he could perceive, in her eyes and manner, &s;ome|thing more than common regard; yet &s;he never, in the &s;e|veral vi&s;its and times &s;he had &s;een her lady&s;hip, which had brought on an intimacy between the young ladies, receiv|ed the lea&s;t information to confirm the opinion her ideas had &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are a number of vicious and licentious vices, which will &s;o far triumph over human nature, as to &s;e|duce tho&s;e from a track of virtue, that for years have been re&s;pected as valuable members of &s;ociety. Yet we &s;ee few but what, at &s;ome time or other, feel the mo&s;t &s;evere pangs from remor&s;e of con&s;cience, and a retro&s;pect of the fair character they once held in the world; contra&s;ted with the &s;corn and &s;lighting treatment they are nece&s;&s;itated to &s;uffer from many who, at an early part of life, would have been proud of their e&s;teem, yet had lived to behold their &s;uperiors reduced to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of penury and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Reflection is never more poignant than when happy &s;cenes once enjoyed are compared with the mi&s;ery of a pre&s;ent &s;tate&mdash;which mi&s;ery has been occa&s;ioned by ne|glect, indolence, or extravagance. The mo&s;t abandoned ex|perience moments, when acute feelings a&s;&s;ail them with redoubled force: yet the&s;e feelings in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;erve only to harden them in their crimes, and drive them to acts of de&s;peration. On others they take different effect; repentance, and &s;hame for what is pa&s;t, urge them to amend for the future; give them &s;trength and inclination to di&s;entangle them&s;elves from tho&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments they are plunged into, and make them more cautious and wary through the remainder of life.</P>

Alfred, at &s;erious intervals, was nearly di&s;tracted with the idea of his own conduct; yet he had no power to re|form: tho&s;e re&s;olutions of amendment made in a morning, were thought of no more when the gambling hour approached; his care for the welfare of his &s;i&s;ter would &s;ometimes make him thoughtful in the mid&s;t of di&s;&s;ipation, but he was laughed at by his gay companions, and &s;uffered to be melancholy no more.</P>
<P>His pride was hurt at the behaviour of lord Albourn; yet he knew he merited it: and his love for lady Caroline &s;till drew him to a hou&s;e where he was received by its owner with little cordiality and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor did count D'Ollifont's attention to his &s;i&s;ter alto|gether pa&s;s his notice: his natural jealou&s;y made him believe &s;he really liked his addre&s;&s;es, and he in&s;tantly mi&s;|took common civility for returned affection.</P>

He delivered to her the paper &s;ealed up: and, after in|quiring her health, and telling her he was &s;orry he had troubled her, but that he was ordered to deliver it into her own hands, he would have departed:&mdash;Matilda &s;topped him, and begged to know if he had been ill.</P>
<P>The tear almo&s;t &s;tarted from his eyes. "No, madam, I thank you"&mdash;was all he could an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; Leonard," continued Matilda, deeply affected with the mark of his attachment, "tell me from whence this un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ne&s;s proceeds; I am &s;ure you are not well: perhaps my brother's hou&s;e does not &s;uit your con&s;titution."</P>
<P>Leonard &s;eemed hurt that he had gone &s;o far, and, after &s;tammering an excu&s;e, would again have withdrawn; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on his &s;itting down and ordered &s;ome refre&s;h|ment; that was however u&s;ele&s;s; his appetite was gone, and he &s;eemed in the la&s;t &s;tage of con&s;umption. She then implored him, by the love he bore her family, and by the regard he had for his ma&s;ter and her&s;elf, to inform her of every circum&s;tance relative to his affairs: "for I am cer|tain," continued Matilda, "they are in a di&s;agreeable &s;itu|ation; the expen&s;ive manner in which he lives, added to his fondne&s;s for play, confirms tho&s;e reports which have been hinted to me by many, whom I know to be well ac|quainted with his proceedings.</P>
<P>The man &s;eemed &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at her know|ledge of tho&s;e circum&s;tances he had dreaded to communi|cate to her; and confe&s;&s;ed, by the appearance and beha|viour of his ma&s;ter, the wor&s;t might be expected; that the hours he kept were unrea&s;onable, and that his manner of|ten &s;hewed him to be di&s;tracted. He al&s;o told her he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w he had drawn on mon&s;ieur La M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ie &s;everal times; "in &s;hort, my dear lady," continued Leonard, "he is quite an altered man, and he &s;ometimes returns home in

a morning, after I have been &s;itting up for him all night, in &s;uch ill temper, that it cuts me to the heart."</P>
<P>Matilda found her&s;elf incapable of bearing this inter|view any longer with fortitude; &s;he therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the faithful &s;ervant, with repeated a&s;&s;urances of her e&s;teem for him, and a reque&s;t that if any other circum&s;tances &s;hould ari&s;e concerning her brother, he would immediate|ly repair to Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, and relate them to her. She directly retired to her chamber, and broke open the letter: &s;ignora Ma&s;erini's manu&s;cript dropped from the cover, on which Alfred had wrote a few lines. He con|cluded with &s;aying, he could plainly perceive by her man|ner, &s;he had an attachment for count D'Ollifont, which gave him the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s; and though he had hi|therto kept the inclo&s;ed from her &s;ight, through motives of tenderne&s;s, yet the common force of nature urged him to take every method in his power to prevent her forming a wretched alliance with a villain, the &s;uppo&s;ed murderer of their father.</P>
<P>The paper fell from her hand, and &s;he fainted in the chair. Mi&s;s Peviquil at that moment opened the door: &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee Matilda in a fit, but immediate|ly rang the bell. A &s;ervant attended: water and hart&s;-horn were procured, and &s;he recovered in a &s;hort time. Both papers lay on the floor, but fortunately were not ob|&s;erved by either of the &s;ervants or Mi&s;s Peviquil, during their attendance on their fair patient; but, at the begin|ning of her recovery, they were taken up by her own wo|man, who was going to deliver them to her lady, not thinking Matilda able to take them: yet her ideas were not &s;o deranged but a recollection of their contents &s;truck her with the impropriety of their being &s;een by the fami|ly; &s;he therefore exerted her utmo&s;t &s;trength, and, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> able to &s;peak, &s;natched them from the girl's

<P>Mi&s;s Peviquil felt her&s;elf hurt at the di&s;appointment her curio&s;ity &s;uffered by not &s;eeing the letters which had cau&s;ed &s;uch violent emotion in her friend: &s;he directly &s;u&s;pected it to be a love affair, and maliciou&s;ly determined to be revenged on her, by relating the whole &s;tory in com|pany. With the&s;e charitable re&s;olutions &s;he took leave, re|que&s;ting to &s;ee her in the drawing room, as Mr. Milverne and &s;ome other gentlemen had paid them a morning vi&s;it, and were inquiring after her health. Matilda returned her many thanks for her care and attention, and promi&s;ed to join them in a few minutes.</P>
<P>Mr. Milverne had been a con&s;tant attendant at &s;ir Peter's, &s;ince his fir&s;t introduction at the ball: his particular po|litene&s;s to Matilda plainly told &s;he was the chief magnet which drew him to the hou&s;e; and though lady Peviquil was not by any means plea&s;ed with this information, which was fir&s;t hinted to her by her daughter, yet &s;he knew not how to di&s;mi&s;s from her parties a young gentle|man of high birth, noble character, and elegant accom|pli&s;hments. Their only hope was, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly entertain any &s;erious ideas of an honourable connection, without his father's con&s;ent; which con&s;ent they were partly certain would never be granted, on account of the old gentleman's avaricious di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Every one expre&s;&s;ed their concern at the languid appear|ance of Matilda, when &s;he entered the room: &s;he excu&s;ed her&s;elf by her having been rather indi&s;po&s;ed that morning.</P>
<P>"Pardon me, mi&s;s Ma&s;erini," returned Mr. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lverne. "your health &s;eems on the decline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: and though I do not mean to alarm you, yet I think the country ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore that bloom to your countenance, which, through fine feelings, has too often vani&s;hed at the en|trance

of a &s;ympathetic tear occa&s;ioned by a tale of woe, or a recital of the misfortunes of others."</P>
<P>Both lady Peviquil and her daughter &s;miled with con|tempt. Matilda thanked him, and &s;aid, &s;he &s;hortly in|tended to leave England, as &s;he did not find the climate agree with her con&s;titution.</P>
<P>He changed colour in&s;tantly;&mdash;his &s;urpri&s;e and emotion were vi&s;ible to all.&mdash;"To leave England, madam!" he replied.&mdash;Having recollected him&s;elf, he in a more com|po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed manner a&s;ked her, if her re&s;olution to that purpo&s;e was not very &s;uddenly taken?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Peviquil con&s;idered this would be a fit opportuni|ty to exerci&s;e her ill-nature, which was greatly heightened by Mr. Milverne's behaviour to Matilda, on the circum|&s;tance of the letter; and immediately an&s;wered to that gentleman's que&s;tion, by &s;ignificant hints, that it was a di&s;|order in the heart, which was extremely difficult to be cur|ed:&mdash;&s;he then, with the utmo&s;t irony and malice, rela|ted the affair in the mo&s;t ridiculous terms, and concluded with a reque&s;t to know the name of her admirer.</P>
<P>Mr. Milverne &s;eemed petrified:&mdash;Matilda was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at her conver&s;ation; the in&s;ulting and malicious wit of mi&s;s Peviquil was more than &s;he could &s;upport; nor had &s;he power to utter a word, but bur&s;t into a flood of tears. Her brother at that moment was announced, and entered the drawing-room.</P>
<P>The embarra&s;&s;ment of the whole party was general: the gentlemen, who, except Mr. Milverne, were chiefly &s;trangers, te&s;tified their approbation of Mi&s;s Peviquil's re|cital by laughing; but the idea that their mirth had drawn tears from a beautiful young woman, ca&s;t a gloom on their countenance, and gave them no very favourable opinion of her who&s;e &s;atirical talents had &s;o much enter|tained them.</P>

<P>ALFRED Ma&s;erini was going to pay the compliments of the morning with more than u&s;ual gaiety, when the &s;ight of Matilda, &s;triving to conceal her tears, &s;truck his eyes; her manner and peculiar &s;ituation prevented his ut|terance: reflection darted on his memory, and his late ill-treatment of her appeared in the mo&s;t black and villa|nous colours: &s;he had been in&s;ulted, he could perceive; friendle&s;s and unprotected, &s;he had no one to take her part; their mother had always recommended Matilda to his care:&mdash;how had be fulfilled her reque&s;t?&mdash;by cruel in|difference, when &s;he was &s;urrounded with &s;educers, danger and di&s;&s;ipation: in &s;hort, every part of his behaviour &s;ince their re&s;idence in London pre&s;ented it&s;elf in the mo&s;t &s;hame|ful light; and the ideas of his own ba&s;ene&s;s kept him mo|tionle&s;s &s;ome time.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence was not broken till he him&s;elf, with the ut|mo&s;t tenderne&s;s, a&s;ked his &s;i&s;ter the cau&s;e of her tears.&mdash;She found he was hurt; and the recollection of his former kindne&s;s, contra&s;ted with his pre&s;ent conduct, threw her in|to another agony of weeping.</P>
<P>He immediately turned, and, with the greate&s;t indigna|tion in his looks, a&s;ked an explanation of his &s;i&s;ter's unea|&s;ine&s;s, which he &s;aid he &s;uppo&s;ed was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome affront &s;he was unable to re&s;ent.&mdash;"If &s;o," continued Al|fred&mdash;"I am arrived here in proper time, to afford that protection which by duty I am bound, and by inclination I am mo&s;t willing, to give."</P>
<P>Mr. Milverne was the only gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e had any know|ledge of in the room; he had noticed that he in general paid particular attention to Matilda; his wild imagination

in&s;tantly took fire, and whi&s;pered him he was the per&s;on who &s;hould an&s;wer for the injury <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> No &s;ooner had this thought &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf, than, in a re&s;olute tone, he in&s;i&s;t|ed on his re&s;olving the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Mr. Milverne &s;tarted from a reverie, which the late conver&s;ation had thrown him into, and, with a manly compo&s;ure, addre&s;&s;ed the di&s;tracted Alfred: "Mo&s;t wil|lingly, &s;ir! My carriage is at the door:&mdash;if you will favour me with your company round the Park, I will inform you of the whole affair; and permit me to &s;ay, &s;ir, had mi&s;s Ma&s;erini's brother been always as anxious after her wel|fare and happine&s;s, there would have been no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">au&s;e for him to have reque&s;ted information, or my a&s;&s;i&s;tance to have given it."</P>
<P>This ju&s;t reproach &s;truck the young Frenchman to the heart; he frowned, and they left the room together.</P>
<P>The gentlemen who remained &s;oon after took their leave. Matilda found her&s;elf alone with lady Peviquil and her daughter. The &s;ituation was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; but &s;he was &s;oon relieved from it, as both retired to their dre&s;&s;ing rooms, the latter making an aukward apology for the un|happine&s;s &s;he had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>Mr. Milverne in the mo&s;t friendly terms informed Al|fred of the cruel treatment his &s;i&s;ter had received, not on|ly that morning, but at many other times, when he him|&s;elf had in the &s;ame manner been witne&s;s to it. He con|jured him to remove her from &s;ir Peter Peviquil's&mdash;re|minded him it was a hou&s;e of di&s;&s;ipation, pride, and lux|ury&mdash;begged him to con&s;ider how dangerous many parts of the company were to a young lady but newly entered into the gaieties of life;&mdash;he even hinted his &s;u&s;picions of Harry Peviquil, and count D'Ollifont.&mdash;This name touched Alfred to the &s;oul; he made no an&s;wer, but heav|ed a convul&s;ive &s;igh.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="035833_0090_10093CF5D8B9A6A0">
Mr. Milverne &s;till continued: "My attention to your &s;i&s;ter has, I own, Mr. Ma&s;erini, been particular; and I now in your pre&s;ence avow that I love her; love her to di&s;traction."</P>
<P>"Why not then, &s;ir," returned Alfred,&mdash;"avow it to the world, and openly addre&s;s her as a man of honor? Not, &s;ir, that I wi&s;h for your alliance with her, more than that of any other gentleman; yet I conceive, when &s;enti|ments of love and attachment are declared for a young woman, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound not with propriety till &s;anctioned by the open behaviour of an intended hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"And that, &s;ir," replied Mr. Milverne, "&s;hould before now have been exemplified in me, had it not been for a whim&s;ical father who&s;e con&s;ent I mu&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible, obtain, for the &s;ake of us both:&mdash;If this can be done, I &s;hall be happy to make her my wife, and think my&s;elf ble&s;&s;ed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a trea&s;ure"</P>
<P>Alfred &s;till remained thoughtful; reflections crowded on his mind, and they were almo&s;t too much for his &s;en&s;es.&mdash;Henry Peviquil, he was now informed, wore a ma&s;k of friend&s;hip to cover his villany: he had more than once thought ill of him, in his tran&s;actions at St. James's-&s;treet; yet he was a young man of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion, the &s;on of a per&s;on of di&s;tinction. But were the&s;e idle pompous orna|ments to make amends for the ruin of his &s;i&s;ter, the di&s;|grace of his family, the cur&s;e of him&s;elf;&mdash;that &s;i&s;ter de|livered to his care by a fond mother&mdash;that &s;i&s;ter whom he was bound to protect by every tie of blood, love, and hon|our&mdash;that &s;i&s;ter who her&s;elf fore&s;aw danger, and wi&s;hed to e&s;cape it, but was prevented by him&mdash;that &s;i&s;ter who&s;e regard for him he knew &s;o be &s;incere&mdash;that &s;i&s;ter who had been in&s;ulted yet had no one to defend her, but tho&s;e who, under motives of charity, would expect a reward that mu&s;t at once cru&s;h her to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of human nature&punc;&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="035833_0091_10093CF1B55215E0">
"Accur&s;ed idea!" exclaimed he, in a voice hardly artic|ulate, pulled the check-&s;tring, and de&s;ired the coachman to &s;top.</P>
<P>There was a wildne&s;s in his look, which alarmed Mr. Milverne. "You are not going to leave me, Mr. Ma&s;erini?" &s;aid he: "I intended to a&s;k you to take a friendly dinner with me."</P>
<P>"I thank you, &s;ir!" returned Alfred, "but mu&s;t bag to be excu&s;ed." He leaped from the carriage, and darted acro&s;s the Park towards Piccadilly.</P>
<P>He had arrived at the turnpike-gate when lord Albourn's po&s;t chariot drove through. Alfred ju&s;t perceived his lord|&s;hip and his daughter were in it. The young lady's eyes met his at the &s;ame moment;&mdash;they both bowed;&mdash;but her father did not ob&s;erve him. He &s;topped the &s;ervant, who was on hor&s;eback paying the toll, and a&s;ked if his lord&s;hip was going a little excur&s;ion from London.</P>
<P>"He is going beyond a little excur&s;ion, &s;ir," replied the man&mdash;"many miles from hence."</P>
<P>Alfred was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment.&mdash;"Many miles!" returned he: "why, lady Caroline never informed me of at, although I &s;aw her ye&s;terday."</P>
<P>"Her lady&s;hip," &s;aid the man, "did not know of it her&s;elf two hours before we &s;et off, as it was a &s;udden whim of lord Albourn's."</P>
<P>The &s;ervant &s;eemed in a hurry to overtake the chariot, which had got &s;ome little di&s;tance;&mdash;but Alfred &s;till de|tained him, to inquire what place they were going to, and when they were to return.</P>
<P>The man an&s;wered, "He really could not tell to what part they were going; but the di&s;tance was near two hundred miles from town;&mdash;that his lord returned in a week, but that lady Caroline was to be left behind." He then &s;purred his hor&s;e, and left his hearer in a &s;tate little better than &s;tupefaction.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="035833_0092_10093CF867EC7580">
That lord Albourn had taken his daughter from Lon|don merely to avoid any further intimacy with him, was certain; in &s;hort, the occurrences of the morning had overwhelmed him, with de&s;pair, and he found him&s;elf at his own lodgings, before his recollection had reminded him he was going that way. Leonard opened the door; this faithful &s;ervant plainly &s;aw the agitation of his &s;pirits.&mdash;Alfred &s;trove to di&s;gui&s;e his unea&s;ine&s;s, and a&s;ked, with &s;ome degree of compo&s;ure, if any per&s;on had called &s;ince he left home? Leonard an&s;wered, "No one, except a mean-looking man, who had left a note for him, which lay in the dre&s;&s;ing room."&mdash;He immediately repaired to it and read the contents; it was from his taylor, reque&s;ting the payment of &s;eventy pounds on the next day&mdash;and, if di&s;appointed, threatened an arre&s;t. He had, a week be|fore, drawn upon his banker in France, for the la&s;t three hundred pounds of his fortune; this would not even pay his debts. Ruin and confu&s;ion learned to encircle him: where was now his pride&mdash;his honor&mdash;his character as a gentleman and a &s;oldier? Where was his love for his &s;i&s;|ter? In what manner was he to make good his word, of adding a part of his fortune to hers?&mdash;If he remained in England, di&s;grace and infamy mu&s;t &s;urround him;&mdash;nor could he fly, but like a mean and beggarly outca&s;t of &s;oci|ety, leaving behind him the name of a &s;windler and a vil|lain. Even in his own country, he mu&s;t meet the re|proaches of tho&s;e to whom he u&s;ed to preach le&s;&s;ons of mo|rality, and by example enforced his doctrine. Matilda too, what was to become of her? Her fortune would not &s;upport her. "Mu&s;t &s;he," &s;aid he, "through my faults and follies, &s;ink with me into de&s;truction? Who is to protect her when I am in jail? That villain, count D'Ol|lifont, whom I &s;u&s;pect to be the murderer of my father, may &s;eize on the moment to complete his accur&s;ed inten|tions,

and, like the fiend of hell, laugh at tho&s;e his mi&s;|chief has hurled headlong into irremediable ruin.

<P>The glittering &s;teel trembled in his hand;&mdash;his arm wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the very motion to &s;trike his heart, when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound it with-held by a per&s;on behind him. He turned, ga&s;ping with convul&s;ive madne&s;s; the good old Leonard dropped before him on his knees:&mdash;"Merciful father," exclaimed he, "look on him with an eye of pity!"&mdash;then turning to Alfred with a &s;tern a&s;pect; "is this, &s;ir," &s;aid he, "a time to appear before that God, to whom you have &s;o much to an&s;wer for, and from whom &s;o little to expect? Look, &s;ir, in the mirror before you; and con&s;ider if your figure is in a proper &s;tate for a dying man; your countenance convul&s;ed and agitated; your &s;en&s;es in a &s;tate of di&s;trac|tion; the &s;word of your departed father lifted in your hand ready to &s;uper&s;ede the power of your God, by put|ting an end to that exi&s;tence he gave you, and con&s;equent|ly has alone a right to extingui&s;h."</P>
<P>The &s;word dropped from his hand; he &s;unk into a chair, and felt &s;everely the ju&s;t reproaches of his &s;ervant; "I thank you, Leonard," was all he could &s;ay; but he made a motion to be alone. Leonard fir&s;t &s;ecured the weapon, and then left him to meditate on his ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>He continued for &s;ome time in a &s;tate of &s;tupid in&s;en&s;i|bility, but by degrees recovered, and &s;huddered at the danger he had e&s;caped. His re&s;olution was fixed, never more to game; he &s;wore by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oath, never to play but for a trifling &s;um, nor any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re to hazard

him&s;elf at a place where, to his co&s;t, he had experienced the villany of mankind under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s. With the&s;e re&s;olutions Alfred &s;taid at home the remainder of the day, thanked Leonard again for his care, and retired to re&s;t with more compo&s;ure and &s;atis|faction than he had for months before.</P>
<P>Matilda was overpowered with misfortunes. The ac|count of her father's di&s;appearance, and the &s;u&s;picion which re&s;ted on the count, whom &s;he had before di&s;liked, but now even &s;huddered at his name, &s;unk her into new troubles and di&s;tre&s;s. The in&s;ults &s;he had received from mi&s;s Peviquil, although they had confirmed her in the idea of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the e&s;teem if not the love of Mr. Mil|verne, entirely &s;ettled her determination of leaving Eng|land. To accompli&s;h this, &s;he re&s;olved to demand of her brother a &s;mall part of her fortune, to carry her over to France; and, immediately on her arrival in that country, to enter a convent, and totally &s;eclude her&s;elf from a world where, young as &s;he was, &s;he could plainly per|ceive the intere&s;ted and &s;ordid views of mankind; and &s;ickened at tho&s;e gaieties of high life &s;he once langui&s;hed to enjoy.</P>

<P>WHY was &s;uperior &s;trength, fortitude, and courage, given to man? Why does he naturally inherit the&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings

in a greater degree than woman? To protect the weak and defencele&s;s from the gripe and cruelty of the wicked; to give &s;uccour to tho&s;e who in their nature are le&s;s capable of bearing up again&s;t impo&s;ition; and who con&s;equently require that aid, which, according to the laws of chri&s;tianity, he is bound to afford them.</P>
<P>Who is the cau&s;e of this horrid downfal to infamy and &s;hame? Man! he who in the book of nature was or|dained to bear the image of the Supreme Being, and crea|ted to take on him the godlike office of protector to the female part of the world; yet doth he blunt his feelings again&s;t every trait of humanity, and dares de&s;troy that which the Almighty intended he &s;hould pre&s;erve. Of this de&s;cription there are many: but it is to be hoped they are greatly overbalanced by the more noble and gen|erous part of mankind, who equally feel the effects of beauty, yet &s;corn to gratify their pa&s;&s;ions by villanous and deliberate &s;chemes of &s;eduction.</P>
<P>Count D'Ollifont was &s;truck with Matilda's charms, the fir&s;t evening he was at &s;ir Peter's; and, in the few minutes' interval between &s;eeing her and being introduced, he &s;ettled within his own mind, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;educe her.</P>
<P>The count was a man who experienced no di&s;turbance from the intru&s;ion of honor, con&s;cience, or feeling; the milk of human kindne&s;s was not in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y re&s;pect concerned, in &s;oftening his compo&s;ition: the tear of compa&s;&s;ion was never &s;een in his eye, nor could the mo&s;t di&s;mal tale or even &s;ight of woe procure from him an accent of pity, or even a &s;ympathetic &s;igh. The gratification of his pa&s;|&s;ions was his whole concern; nor did he &s;top at any thing to accompli&s;h what his wi&s;hes prompted him to po&s;&s;e&s;s. He now enjoyed the whole e&s;tates and large fortune of count Ma&s;erini, grandfather to Alfred and Matilda; he could therefore well afford to live in the mo&s;t &s;plendid and elegant manner. On riches he chiefly depended to &s;uc|ceed
<PB N="95" REF="035833_0096_10093CFB79C0E980">
with the ladies; as he knew his age would almo&s;t give him the title of an elderly man.</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t planned in what manner to make his at|tack on the beautiful young foreigner, when &s;ir Peter Pe|viquil, as was before related, led him up, and introduced her under the name of Ma&s;erini. The picture of her fa|ther plainly confirmed who &s;he was. A &s;udden horror overcame him; he felt a &s;omething &s;trike his heart, which he had heard de&s;cribed as the touch of remor&s;e; he, how|ever, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oon recovered, and re&s;umed his natural gaiety and politene&s;s. Yet the behaviour of Alfred did not go unno|ticed by him; and it &s;eemed as if he had actually known tho&s;e intentions the former had been weighing in his mind five minutes before.</P>
<P>Re&s;t for&s;ook the pillow of the count that night; his ideas of &s;eduction received a check at the mention of the name; yet every circum&s;tance coincided with his wi&s;hes, except her brother: him he feared. Mean and da&s;tardly in his di&s;po&s;ition, he was fearful even as a child, and would &s;hrink like a wretched reptile from the ju&s;t revenge of a man whom he had cringed to with meanne&s;s, for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying his happine&s;s, and ruining his family.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved not to be too ha&s;ty in the affair, but in eve|ry re&s;pect to make him&s;elf agreeable to Matilda, and wait for an opportunity, when, by &s;ome means or other, Alfred &s;hould be unable to afford that protection his &s;i&s;ter would require.</P>
<P>That opportunity was now arrived; the tailor, who had threatened in a letter to arre&s;t him, was the &s;ame that made the count's clothes; it was he who fir&s;t per&s;uaded the man to take that method; &s;uppo&s;ing that, not being able in &s;o little a time to procure bail, he mu&s;t be confin|ed at lea&s;t for one night, and during that time he could by force (finding that none of his per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence
<PB N="96" REF="035833_0097_10093D44EEDC1FD0">
had any effect on Matilda) convey her to &s;ome &s;ecret &s;pot, where he might, unmole&s;ted, take advantage of her &s;itu|tion.</P>
<P>This diabolical &s;cheme was, accordingly, with the great|e&s;t deliberation, put into execution; and the tailor in|formed the count in the evening, that he had not received his money; the latter then ordered the man, on pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure, and entire lo&s;s of his cu&s;tom, not to fail to put his threats in practice. To add greater force to this reque&s;t, he pre&s;ented him with a ten pound bank-note, over and above the bill he then paid him; and received a &s;olemn promi&s;e, in return, that his wi&s;hes &s;hould be ac|compli&s;hed with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>Count D'Ollifont then proceeded to &s;ir Peter Peviquil's; he plainly perceived there had been a mi&s;under&s;tanding between the ladies: but it did not in any re&s;pect alter his plan.</P>
<P>He pre&s;ented the family with tickets for a grand ma&s;|querade which was to be at the Pantheon the next even|ing, and al&s;o begged Mr. Milverne's acceptance of one, who entered the room &s;oon after him.</P>
<P>Matilda at fir&s;t declined going; but the count would take no refu&s;al. She &s;eemed particularly cool in her be|haviour towards him; but this did not in any re&s;pect damp his &s;pirits in the plot he had undertaken.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, he hinted that he &s;hould like Mr. Ma&s;erini to be of the party, and pretended he &s;hould likewi&s;e &s;end him a ticket the following morning. He gave them to under&s;tand the manager of it was patron|i&s;ed by him&s;elf, and con&s;equently he &s;hould exert his in|tere&s;t as much as po&s;&s;ible in his behalf.</P>
<P>The count, Mr Milverne, and Henry Peviquil, e&s;corted the ladies to a concert: they returned to &s;upper. Mr. Milverne &s;eemed unhappy; Matilda extremely dejected.
<PB N="97" REF="035833_0098_10093D00B0228E38">
She inquired how he left her brother; he did not wi&s;h to relate to her the manner in which Alfred flew from the carriage; but turned the conver&s;ation by &s;aying, "He could not per&s;uade him to take a dinner."&mdash;She would have continued, but was interrupted by the count's a&s;k|ing in what characters they intended to appear. Matilda and Mr. Milverne re&s;olved to go in dominos; Henry Pe|viquil declared he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the character of Don Quix|ote; &s;ir Peter, a hermit; her lady&s;hip, a nun; and mi&s;s Peviquil, a gip&s;y. The count &s;aid he did not think him|&s;elf able to &s;upport a character, and therefore &s;hould fol|low the example of his fair cou&s;in, as he was plea&s;ed to &s;tyle her, and appear in no particular dre&s;s. About one o'clock he took his leave, and promi&s;ed to be with them the next evening. Mr. Milverne likewi&s;e appointed to call in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare at the &s;ame hour.</P>
<P>Matilda retired to her chamber, but not to &s;leep; &s;he di&s;liked even the &s;ight of count D'Ollifont; yet &s;he had con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nted to be conducted by him to a ma&s;querade. It was an entertainment &s;he had much wi&s;hed to &s;ee; but had heard of its being a dangerous &s;cene of amu&s;ement. She however re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to per&s;uade her brother to accompany them, and for once be the cau&s;e of &s;pending a di&s;&s;ipated evening: &s;he &s;hould then con&s;ider her&s;elf &s;afe in his pre&s;ence, and have greater enjoyment of the enter|tainment.</P>
<P>Alfred Ma&s;erini aro&s;e in the morning, more compo&s;ed than he had been for many weeks; having already re&s;ol|ved, immediately on receiving the &s;um he expected from M. Le Mercier, to di&s;charge his debts, and retire with his &s;i&s;ter to France. He &s;at down to breakfa&s;t, again thanked Leonard for his care, and told him of the alteration in his

Count D'Ollifont has engag|ed &s;ir Peter Peviquil's family to a ma&s;querade this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at tho Pantheon: and it is his intention in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the night to convey mi&s;s Ma&s;erini, by treachery, to a hou&s;e he has provided in the country for this purpo&s;e; where he will take every advantage of her &s;ituation. He is al&s;o determined to deprive her of your protection, by keep|ing you away; which &s;cheme he has planned with the tailor who &s;ent to you for money ye&s;terday. The man will call this morning, and arre&s;t you if the bill is not di&s;|charged. Be not offended at &s;eeing the inclo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ool, bank note, as you may not immediately be able to procure the &s;um:&mdash;pay him, and, if po&s;&s;ible, per&s;uade him to keep the knowledge of it from the count.

Among them will be three dominos, which are the di&s;gui&s;es of your &s;i&s;ter, Mr. Milverne, and the count: watch diligently the latter, whom you will ob|&s;erve draw the young lady to a private room, and then by force take her to a carriage that is to wait at the back-door of the building.

</LETTER>
<P>Alfred's a&s;toni&s;hment at reading this extraordinary epi&s;|tle, may well be conceived. He &s;howed it to Leonard, and a&s;ked his advice; the old man begged him to attend to its contents: "No one, &s;ir," &s;aid he, "could have an intere&s;t in writing &s;uch a letter; and the bank-note fully confirms it to be no idle frolic." His ideas were the &s;ame as his ma&s;ter's, and they determined to exe|cute implicitly the directions given. The receiving of the money hurt him; but it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o di&s;charge the debt, as he had none of his own, till that he had &s;ent for arrived: he however re&s;olved to find out, if po&s;&s;ible, the per&s;on, and repay him with every acknow|ledgment, if the &s;u&s;picions were well grounded.</P>
<P>Alfred determined, in the fir&s;t place, not to &s;ee his &s;i&s;|ter, and gave Leonard orders, if any of the &s;ervants &s;hould come from, Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, to &s;end word back he was not at home.</P>
<P>About eleven o'clock, the tailor arrived, was introduced, and received his money. The man was a&s;toni&s;hed. Al|fred in&s;i&s;ted on his taking a gla&s;s of wine, and made him a pre&s;ent for the trouble he had cau&s;ed. He then related to him the &s;cheme which he had heard was to be put in practice by the count and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;e, guilt, and con&s;ternation, &s;topped the tailor's utterance: he believed it mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;upernatural pow|er that had informed him of it. Alfred argued with him for &s;ome time, explained the villainy of &s;uch proceedings, and the ruin that might have en&s;ued. In &s;hort, he work|ed &s;o much on the poor fellow's feelings, that he fell at his feet, a&s;ked ten thou&s;and pardons, and begged to know
<PB N="100" REF="035833_0101_10093D4DAAFEE988">
if he could in any re&s;pect &s;erve him, to recompence the injury he had intended to commit.</P>
<P>Alfred took him at his word, and informed him that the only way to make reparation, would be, to go imme|diately to the count, and &s;ay that every circum&s;tance had &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;hes, for that Mr. Ma&s;erini was in clo&s;e confinement. The man promi&s;ed to be punctual in the me&s;&s;age, and, after again thanking him for his genero&s;ity, departed.</P>
<P>As it was expected, a &s;ervant called from &s;ir Peter's, to my that mi&s;s Ma&s;erini wi&s;hed much to &s;ee her brother Leonard told him he was ju&s;t gone out.</P>
<P>Alfred then &s;ent to procure his dre&s;s with as much &s;e|cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y as po&s;&s;ible: it was a plain domino, that he might not be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the afternoon, the &s;ervant from Gro&s;|venor-&s;quare arrived a &s;econd time; but was an&s;wered as before, that Mr. Ma&s;erini was not yet returned; he left a note from his &s;i&s;ter, and de&s;ired it might be given him as &s;oon as he came home. Alfred opened it: Matilda in|formed him how much again&s;t her inclination it was to ac|company the count to a ma&s;querade; yet &s;he could not decline the invitation without ab&s;olute rudene&s;s. She re|que&s;ted her brother would be there, and concluded with &s;aying, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he had al&s;o received a ticket.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved to take no notice of the letter, but as the anonymous epi&s;tle de&s;ired (the contents of which he had now every rea&s;on to believe authentic), to go him&s;elf, un|known to every one. He panted for the moment when he &s;hould detect the villain in the very act of inju&s;tice and cruelty he had long &s;u&s;pected him to be guilty of; and cru&s;h that mon&s;ter to the earth, who dared attempt the honor of his family.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="035833_0102_10093D0589E3FF68">
The wi&s;hed-for hour of twelve was announced; when, having placed in his pocket a brace of pi&s;tols, he threw him&s;elf into a hackney coach, and ordered the coachman to drive to the Pantheon.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="20" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>ALFRED ordered the coachman, when he &s;topped at the front doors in Oxford-road, to drive round and wait for him at the back entrance.</P>
<P>The Pantheon was crowded; the company were nume|rous and elegant; every one looked happy and plea&s;ed with each other. "I," &s;aid Alfred, "am the only per|&s;on who &s;eem un&s;ociable and alone." Several characters pa&s;&s;ed, which he knew by their voices; but he could no|where trace tho&s;e he wi&s;hed to recogni&s;e; when on a &s;ud|den a group of bacchanals ru&s;hed by him, and&punc; among them he ob&s;erved Don Quixote. Having addre&s;&s;ed the figure in a feigned voice, by inquiring after his Dulcinea del Tobo&s;o, he immediately received a witty an&s;wer from a tongue which plainly confirmed it to be Henry Pevi|quil.</P>
<P>He now judged the re&s;t of the party mu&s;t be in the rooms, and accordingly continued his &s;earch.</P>
<P>In about a quarter of an hour he perceived the knight join his company; they were dre&s;&s;ed exactly as the letter had de&s;cribed, except that he could ob&s;erve only two do|minios, which he found were his &s;i&s;ter and the count; but &s;oon after heard them &s;peak, as if they were &s;urpri&s;ed at not &s;eeing Mr. Milverne</P>
<P>At &s;upper the greater part of the company unma&s;ked,
<PB N="102" REF="035833_0103_10093D4F31725340">
and Alfred was confirmed that his conjectures on each of the characters were right. He &s;till continued di&s;gui&s;ed, with his eye fixed on them: and it gave plea&s;ure to &s;ee Matilda treat the count with the utmo&s;t coolne&s;s: but yet he thought he could perceive, in the countenance of the latter, a malicious &s;mile occa&s;ioned by the hope of having her &s;hortly in his power. The&s;e ideas made him re|double his vigilance; and he directly after the repa&s;t join|ed them almo&s;t clo&s;e, but &s;trove as much as po&s;&s;ible to e&s;|cape notice.</P>
<P>Henry Peviquil and his father &s;eemed heated by the wine they had drank; mi&s;s Peviquil was chiefly taken up in gallanting with a gambling friend to her brother's; and her lady&s;hip in paying compliments of her fa&s;hionable ac|quaintance. Count D'Ollifont attended to none but his fair relation; and the inattention &s;he received from the others, gave him an opportunity of continuing his polite|ne&s;s. Alfred remarked a magician who followed al&s;o the &s;teps of the count; his dre&s;s was, truly conformablo to the part he performed, and he held in one hand a wand, the emblem of his power. This figure gave him &s;ome chagrin, and he re&s;olved to addre&s;s it, by a&s;king him in what manner he made u&s;e of his art: the magician an|&s;wered, in a voice which he thought he had &s;omewhere heard, "That he puni&s;hed the guilty, and gave &s;uccour to the innocent. I know you, young man," &s;aid he: "and you are in a noble cau&s;e; be cautious how you execute it."</P>
<P>Alfred was &s;taggered at this reply, but yet thought they might be words of chance, and begged an explanation of the incoherent &s;entence. The magician &s;aid, he would convince him of his knowledge; and immediately wrote on a card the following words. "Your name is Ma&s;eri|ni; your bu&s;ine&s;s at this place is to protect the honor of
<PB N="103" REF="035833_0104_10093D081F678148">
your family in the per&s;on of your &s;i&s;ter: the time draws near: be diligent, and fail not."</P>
<P>By the time he had read the&s;e few words, the magician was gone; and the a&s;toni&s;hed Alfred &s;tood for &s;ome time motionle&s;s: he &s;eemed in a dream, and could hardly be|lieve his &s;en&s;es; yet he &s;uppo&s;ed this &s;tranger mu&s;t be the per&s;on who had &s;ent him the letter. The count and his &s;i&s;ter were nearly out of &s;ight at a different part of the Rotunda, but he quickly made up to them; their party had entirely di&s;per&s;ed, and Matilda &s;eemed extremely un|ea&s;y. The former in vain &s;trove to give her comfort; &s;he could hardly conceal her tears. It was about three o'clock, the time fixed for the horrid &s;cheme, when Alfred ob&s;erv|ed the count draw his &s;i&s;ter to another room, under the idea of &s;eeking their friends. He followed, and heard him inform her that he had been ju&s;t told they waited for them in their carriages at the back entrance. He led her to the door; that being a place for chairs only, there were no coaches near. The count conducted Matilda down the &s;treet, and turned into a part where there was a cha|riot and one hackney coach waiting at a little di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Matilda, &s;eeing no one in the carriage, refu&s;ed to enter it: the count entreated, but &s;he &s;till continued ob&s;tinate, and &s;eemed extremely alarmed. They were not within hearing of any per&s;on but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he hackney coachman and another man who &s;tood with him. Alfred ga&s;ped for breath; his very &s;oul was convul&s;ed with rage. Count D'Ollifont with &s;ome vehemence again in&s;i&s;ted on her complying with his reque&s;t: &s;he an&s;wered, &s;he would die fir&s;t, and bur&s;t into a flood of tears: he then began to force her into the carriage.</P>
<P>"Your brother, now, madam," &s;aid the count, "is
<PB N="104" REF="035833_0105_10093D5302828848">
not here to encourage your pride, or fru&s;trate my wi&s;hes." She &s;creamed, and fainted.</P>
<P>"Damnable villain!" exclaimed Alfred: "know thou art mi&s;taken: for you now behold him ready to protect the honor of his hou&s;e, by cru&s;hing to the earth that wretch who dare &s;educe his &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>While he uttered the&s;e words, Matilda remained in the arms of one of the count's &s;ervants, in&s;en&s;ible. Leonard, who had dreaded his ma&s;ter's violence of temper by the pi&s;tols he had taken in his pockets, determined to be near at the time, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his young lady&punc; he accordingly waited with a hackney coach, the &s;ame that &s;tood near the count's chariot. He immediately ran to the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of Matilda, forced her from the footman, and placed her in the vehicle he had hired.</P>
<P>During this time count D'Ollifont was &s;truck motionle&s;s: he could hardly believe him&s;elf awake; but the figure of the enraged Frenchman, who had now unma&s;ked, plainly confirmed the truth.</P>
<P>"I was only," &s;aid he with a &s;mile, "going to con|duct your &s;i&s;ter to &s;ir Peter's."</P>
<P>"Liar I villain!" exclaimed Alfred, "thou wa&s;t going to take her to a place where, unprotected, &s;he mu&s;t have &s;unk beneath thy diabolical intentions; nay more," con|tinued he, in a low voice, "I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect thee to be the murderer of her father."</P>
<P>He &s;tarted, &s;tood about a minute in a thoughtful po&s;|ture, and then uttered with a cur&s;e&mdash;"De&s;perate cau&s;es require de&s;perate rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dies!"&mdash;pulled a pi&s;tol from his &s;ide pocket, and fired at his adver&s;ary:&mdash;owing to his agi|tation, the ball pa&s;&s;ed, and Alfred remained unhurt: but he in&s;tantly di&s;charged one at the count, who fell, and every &s;park of life &s;eemed extingui&s;hed. The coachman
<PB N="105" REF="035833_0106_10093D0C523C8888">
and the footman cried their ma&s;ter was murdered, and in|&s;tantly &s;ecured the young foreigner, who made no re&s;i&s;|tance, but &s;eemed buried in a reverie; till the magician, whom he had noticed in the rooms, came up.</P>
<P>"I &s;ee," &s;aid he, "there has been bloody work here; but puni&s;hment has fallen on the right per&s;on." He un|ma&s;ked, and di&s;covered the features of Mr. Milverne.</P>
<P>The men &s;till kept their hold of Alfred: but no crowd had a&s;&s;embled, as they were &s;ome di&s;tance from the doors, and in a private &s;treet. Mr. Milverne took the part of his friend, &s;oon di&s;engaged him from confinement, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Leonard, who had by this time made him&s;elf known, forced him to the coach. They promi&s;e the man a large reward, if he would drive as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible towards the fir&s;t &s;tage to Dover.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es, which had not been out in the day, travel|led with the utmo&s;t &s;peed; and the driver, in hopes of the money, failed not to exert his abilities in keeping up their pace, in&s;omuch that he brought them to an inn at Dartford by eight in the morning.</P>
<P>During the time of their journey, Matilda learnt from her brother the whole affair, and plainly perceived they mu&s;t be plunged into new difficulties in con&s;equence of the count's death.</P>
<P>Mr. Milverne might be &s;u&s;pected as the cau&s;e of it; and the idea that &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee him more, added new pangs to tho&s;e &s;he already experienced.</P>
<P>Leonard informed them, when they had got &s;ome di&s;|tance from town, that a packet from France had been re|ceived by the people of the hou&s;e where they lodged; who had neglected to give it till after his ma&s;ter had &s;et off to the ma&s;querade: he therefore, having no place to
<PB N="106" REF="035833_0107_10093D57B7F04448">
put it under lock and key, determined to bring it in his pocket.</P>
<P>This was a fortunate circum&s;tance, as the direction con|firmed it to come from M. Le Mercier: on opening it, Al|fred received the money he had wrote for; it gave them &s;ome comfort, as it would &s;upport them with economy for &s;ome time. But this was of little con&s;equence when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his life mu&s;t be &s;acrificed as &s;oon as the count's death was made known in France; his intere&s;t being &s;o great at court, as to prevent any de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence from &s;av|ing the per&s;on who had deprived him of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>He determined, however, rather to die than cowardly &s;hrink from ju&s;tice, and di&s;grace the name of a &s;oldier. He related to his &s;i&s;ter his re&s;olution; but &s;he conjured him not to ri&s;k his life, from a punctilio of honor.</P>
<P>"You are engaged in a ju&s;t cau&s;e," continued Matilda, and need not be a&s;hamed of your conduct being known to the world." She u&s;ed many other arguments, and a&s;ked him, "To whom &s;he was to look for protection, when he was no more."</P>
<P>"To God," he exclaimed; "for among mankind all honour is lo&s;t. I am &s;ick of the world, Matilda, and care not how &s;oon I leave it." "Surely," &s;aid &s;he, "that fortitude, courage, and patience, which were the leading traits in your character, and which u&s;ed to charm our departed mother, are vani&s;hed: have you no de&s;ire to &s;ee Gra&s;ville Abbey?" The name &s;truck him to the heart. "Who can tell but it is ordained for you to unravel that my&s;tery which has &s;o long hung over our family, and been the ruin of our hou&s;e? But heaven forbid, Alfred, that I &s;hould per&s;uade you to act contrary to that honour which for years has been the boa&s;t of our forefathers&punc;&mdash;
<PB N="107" REF="035833_0108_10093D0DD825C340">
if, therefore, you re&s;olve to make your&s;elf known in France, I will cheerfully enter a convent, and take leave of a world in which I have little happine&s;s to expect." Here &s;he &s;ighed deeply; her heart reminded her that the image of Mr. Milverne would often intrude amid tho&s;e re|ligious duties &s;he would then be bound to perform.</P>
<P>Alfred continued &s;ilent; his curio&s;ity to &s;ee the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his ance&s;tors, the hopes of finding &s;ome clue to the my&s;tic di&s;appearance of his father, urged him to adopt the plans his &s;i&s;ter had propo&s;ed; but his honour, his char|acter as an officer and a man, forbade it.</P>
<P>Every mile he found him&s;elf farther from London, his perplexity increa&s;ed; nor was his determination by any means fixed, when the coach drove up to the principal inn at Dartford. Alfred hand&s;omely rewarded the man, de|&s;ired him to &s;ay nothing concerning the bu&s;ine&s;s he had been witne&s;s to, but give feigned an&s;wers to tho&s;e who &s;hould wonder at &s;eeing a hack &s;o far from London. The coachman promi&s;ed faithfully to obey his orders. They each took &s;ome refre&s;hment, hired po&s;t hor&s;es, and &s;et off again in le&s;s than an hour towards Dover.</P>
<P>Alfred during the journey informed his &s;i&s;ter that his re|&s;olutions were fixed to join his regiment, and throw him|&s;elf on the mercy of his countrymen. "I &s;corn," &s;aid he, "to fly ignobly from a puni&s;hment I flatter my&s;elf I do not ju&s;tly de&s;erve."</P>
<P>Matilda &s;hed a flood of tears, but perfectly acquie&s;ced in his wi&s;hes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;trove to think no more of Mr. Mil|verne; that was impo&s;&s;ible, but yet &s;he con&s;idered, the &s;trict and awful ceremonies of a mona&s;tic life would, in a cour&s;e of time, era&s;e tho&s;e thoughts from her bo&s;om. Alfred in &s;ome re&s;pects was in a &s;imilar &s;ituation; his ac|quaintance with lady Caroline Albourn was fir&s;t com|menced
<PB N="108" REF="035833_0109_10093D5AFAE17898">
in the mid&s;t of di&s;&s;ipation, yet he felt many pangs at the idea of lo&s;ing her for ever. In this career of folly he had per&s;uaded him&s;elf that he was no farther intere&s;t|ed in the affair, than merely the idea of being intimate with a young lady of fa&s;hion, and having an opportunity of toa&s;ting a beautiful girl; but he now plainly perceived that he loved lady Caroline &s;o far as to make his life un|comfortable without her. There was al&s;o another cau&s;e for unea&s;ine&s;s; his debts in London were unpaid to the name of murderer, the appellation of &s;windler mu&s;t be ad|ded: a title he in &s;ome mea&s;ure merited.</P>
<P>His &s;ilence plainly told the &s;tate of his mind; while his &s;i&s;ter &s;hed many tears at thoughts of their pre&s;ent mi&s;|fortunes, and at the recollection of tho&s;e happy hours &s;he had experienced under the care of maternal tenderne&s;s, never, never, to return.</P>
<P>Leonard &s;hared the &s;orrows of them both; yet he re|ceived &s;ome little comfort at the thoughts of returning to that country where he had &s;pent the chief part of his life. They arrived rather late at Dover; Leonard was directly di&s;patched to inquire what time the packet would &s;ail, and brought word back, not till the following evening. This intelligence was extremely di&s;agreeable to them; as they might before that time be recogni&s;ed, taken into cu&s;tody, and conducted back to London. They were nece&s;&s;itated, however, to wait patienely the event; but Alfred reflect|ed, with &s;ome terror, on the horrors of a jail, in a &s;trange country, and under laws he was equally a &s;tranger to. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, they remained at the inn as private as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>About two hours before they intended to &s;ail, a man ar|rived po&s;t from London; he a&s;ked if any travellers were in that hou&s;e, who intended going to France, and was an|&s;wered
<PB N="109" REF="035833_0110_10093D10EFE96568">
in the affirmative. Leonard, who by chance over|heard the conver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, ran to his ma&s;ter, and informed him of the affair; each conjectured it to be an officer of ju&s;tice, and Alfred waited with fortitude and compo&s;ure the event; when they were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed, by &s;eeing the innkeeper introduce Mr. Milverne's valet.</P>
<P>He delivered a letter, the fir&s;t &s;entence of which contain|ed the following words:</P>
<P>"Count D'Ollifont is not yet dead."&mdash;"Thanks be to heaven!" exclaimed Alfred, and communicated the agree|able intelligence to his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. Milverne informed him, that he was kept in cu&s;tody till late in the morning, when he procured bail; being then taken before a magi&s;trate, he explained the whole af|fair, and was honourably cleared. He further informed him that the count's indi&s;po&s;ition was very uncertain, and ad|vi&s;ed him by no means to remain in England, or make him&s;elf known in France, as count D'Ollifont had many friends in that country, who, immediately as they knew of the event, would, through particular intere&s;t at court, place him in the Ba&s;tile for life, even if the former &s;hould recover of his wound.</P>
<P>In the latter part of the letter he mentioned Matilda with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, pitied her &s;ituation, and en|treated Alfred by no means to run hazards, through fal&s;e notions of honour, and leave his &s;i&s;ter de&s;titute of pro|tection. He concluded with &s;aying, he thought they had better pa&s;s over as quick as po&s;&s;ible to Italy, but reque&s;ted he would &s;end word what part they re&s;olved to vi&s;it, as he him&s;elf hoped to join them in a few weeks.</P>
<P>Alfred wrote an an&s;wer, expre&s;&s;ing his gratitude for the gentlemanlike and friendly treatment he had received; informed him that he at fir&s;t re&s;olved to throw him&s;elf on
<PB N="110" REF="035833_0111_10093D5C85228F58">
the laws of his country, although he knew them to be &s;e|vere where a courtier or man of intere&s;t was concerned;&mdash;but that his letter had entirely altered his re&s;olutions, and that he now intended to travel as fa&s;t and as privately as po&s;&s;ible towards Italy: that the hope of &s;eeing him there, and making proper apologies for the &s;trange behaviour he had been guilty of towards him, would in a great mea&s;ure alleviate the di&s;agreeable manner of his journey. He concluded with his &s;i&s;ter's thanks for his kind inquiries, and the equal plea&s;ure &s;he would enjoy with him&s;elf, on &s;eeing Mr. Milverne in a &s;hort interval of time.</P>
<P>This letter was given to the valet, and he &s;et off imme|diately. The ve&s;&s;el &s;et &s;ail a &s;hort time after, and Leo|nard informed his ma&s;ter, while they were cro&s;&s;ing the Channel, that he had learned from Mr Milverne's &s;ervant, that the anonymous letter he had received was &s;ent by that gentleman; for that he, the valet, was employed by his ma&s;ter to draw the plan of proceedings from the count's confidential &s;ervant, whom he contrived to intoxicate with liquor, and then communicated to Mr. Milverne the intel|ligence he had received.</P>
<P>Alfred was vexed that Leonard did not inform him of this circum&s;tance &s;ooner, that he might have returned the money he received, and acknowledged the obligation.</P>
<P>Matilda was &s;till more attached to him: &s;he was happy in the change of &s;entiments which his letter had cau&s;ed in her brother, and looked forward with a con&s;iderable de|gree of plea&s;ure for the time when he &s;hould join them abroad.</P>
<P>After a plea&s;ant voyage of a few hours, they found them|&s;elves landed in their native country; but in a far differ|ent &s;ituation from that they were in when they left it:
<PB N="111" REF="035833_0112_10093D12ACFB2300">
then they were honoured and re&s;pected by all, and afraid of meeting no one: now they were under misfortunes and concealment, &s;hrinking from the eyes of every beholder, like wretched outca&s;ts of &s;ociety, and terrified at being ob&s;erved by every individual.</P>

<P>WHEN men of honor, who&s;e principles and di&s;po&s;itions are naturally ju&s;t, fall under misfortunes, and experience adver&s;ity and di&s;appointment, their feelings &s;uffer a far greater &s;hock than can be felt by tho&s;e who, from child|hood, have been plunged in irregularites, and are well practi&s;ed in the arts of meanne&s;s and deceit.</P>
<P>The &s;ting of remor&s;e &s;eldom la&s;ts longer than that pu|ni&s;hment which they bring upon them&s;elves through perpe|tual indi&s;cretion and deliberate &s;chemes of villany;&mdash;while the man who has been merely led away by example or youthful follies, receives with redoubled force that blow which &s;tabs at once his character and reputation. Nor can he, though the clouds of de&s;pair, which encompa&s;&s;ed him, may be &s;ucceeded by the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity, think
<PB N="112" REF="035833_0113_10093D5F1D84E668">
of di&s;agreeable events at a former part of life, but with angui&s;h and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Of the numberle&s;s griefs and afflictions to which human nature is &s;ubject, poverty is held up as one of a con&s;idera|ble magnitude; it generally procures contempt and ill|treatment from the haughty &s;ons of wealth; and the opinion of the world in general is by no means favourable to tho&s;e who are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of riches and affluence. The&s;e mi&s;taken and &s;hameful ideas are almo&s;t too pre|dominant in every country; and the child of mi&s;ery re|ceives great addition to his woes by the &s;neers and &s;candal of his neighbours. Equality, though a word of terror to the great, if taken in its true meaning, implies &s;enti|ments of the mo&s;t noble and generous kind; in&s;tead of pulling down laws, and levelling the whole cla&s;s of man|kind, it would confirm unity, peace, and good order.</P>
<P>The rod of oppre&s;&s;ion too often falls upon that man who is unable, through misfortunes or peculiar circum&s;tances, to rai&s;e him&s;elf again&s;t the weight; but cru&s;hed by its power, he &s;inks beneath the force of inju&s;tice, and is lo&s;t to his God, his family, and him&s;elf; whereas, in the time of his &s;orrows, had he received comfort, &s;uccour, or a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, he might have continued to have proved a valuable member of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Alfred Ma&s;erini meditated with painful ideas on tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es which had happened, through his own mi&s;con|duct, during the time they had been in England. He not only beheld him&s;elf &s;urrounded with difficulties, but his &s;i&s;ter, who was innocent of the cau&s;e, equally involved, through his errors and vices. Young, beautiful, and ac|compli&s;hed, &s;he was but ill calculated to undergo the hard|&s;hips of life; yet &s;he &s;ubmitted to them with re&s;ignation, and could even teach patience to him who had brought her
<PB N="113" REF="035833_0114_10093D18207D2380">
to the pre&s;ent di&s;quietude. This would cut him to the &s;oul; and the &s;calding tear of repentance would often &s;tart from his eye, in defiance of the many efforts he made to conceal it.</P>
<P>He was impetuous, proud, and courageous in his di&s;po|&s;ition; yet, in feelings he was a woman: nor was his pride of that nature to make him over-look affliction, al|though concealed in a hut of poverty and mi&s;ery. But he laid too great a &s;tre&s;s on the punctilios of honour and high birth; he valued the name he bore, with &s;uch ardour as to make him re&s;ent the lea&s;t affront offered in the family to which it belonged.</P>
<P>Their arrival at Calais was attended with di&s;agreeable and degrading circum&s;tances, on account of their giving in their names, which were feigned ones, and the review of their baggage, which con&s;i&s;ted of clothes and a few arti|cles which Matilda had received from Mr. Milverne's va|let; that gentleman having procured from &s;ir Peter's what little goods &s;he &s;et a value on, and de&s;ired his &s;ervant to deliver them at Dover. Their travelling through France was in every re&s;pect extremely uncomfortable, and the dif|ficulties they met with in con&s;equence of their endeavouring to conceal them&s;elves from vulgar curio&s;ity, extremely di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>They had nearly arrived at the Alps, when they halted for the night at a &s;mall inn. The accommodation was ve|ry indifferent, and they were given to under&s;tand by the ho&s;te&s;s that &s;ome Engli&s;h per&s;ons of di&s;tinction were then in the hou&s;e, who took up the be&s;t rooms. They were therefore nece&s;&s;itated to put up with the inconvenience, and, after a &s;canty meal, retired to poor and de&s;olate apart|ments. Both Alfred and Matilda, with Leonard, had, the la&s;t day's journey, rode on hor&s;es which the former pur|cha&s;ed
<PB N="114" REF="035833_0115_10093D61BA2066D0">
of a &s;muggler at a low price, con&s;idering that it would be the cheape&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ecret way of travelling. Leonard &s;aw the cattle &s;afely placed in a barn &s;ome di&s;|tance from the hou&s;e; the &s;tables being occupied by the hor&s;es and &s;ervants of the per&s;ons whom the landlady had mentioned: he then laid him&s;elf down on a &s;mall bed in one corner of the building.</P>
<P>Leonard had not been a&s;leep above two hours, before he was awakened by a glare of light which darted right on his eyes through an opening on one &s;ide of the barn. He immediately &s;tarted up, and looked out at the door, and perceived that the inn was in flames. He hurried on his clothes, and ran as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to the &s;pot, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t his ma&s;ter and young lady. By the time he got there, one part of the hou&s;e was entirely burnt down, and the re|mainder &s;urrounded with flames: he was happy however to &s;ee his ma&s;ter and Matilda &s;afe; and the former deli|vered to him the trunks, which he took care to place in &s;e|curity.</P>
<P>A number of pea&s;ants were a&s;&s;embled round, and each &s;eemed to bewail the &s;ituation of a young lady and her fa|ther, who &s;lept in tho&s;e rooms which were on fire; but no one dared to go to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as the whole fabric was expected to fall in a few minutes. Nor was the general conjecture wrong, for in a very little time the front gave way, and fell; which di&s;covered the internal part of the two rooms. They could &s;ee nothing of the gentleman; it was therefore &s;uppo&s;ed that he was &s;uffocated, and had fallen among the ruins at the back part; but the eyes of the &s;pectators experienced a mo&s;t horrid &s;ight in the other apartment: a young lady was &s;tanding in the middle of the flames. The agony &s;uch a &s;ituation mu&s;t in&s;pire, had made her in&s;en&s;ible; her hands were
<PB N="115" REF="035833_0116_10093D1C29A740F8">
cla&s;ped together, and her eyes lifted towards heaven. The people cried out to give her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but none dar|ed try the experiment, till Alfred, touched with compa&s;&s;ion for the unfortunate female, &s;prang forward with a ladder, and placed it again&s;t the part of the building which was yet &s;tanding: he had a&s;cended above half way, when the part where the ladder re&s;ted again&s;t broke from his weight; but he had ro&s;e far enough to perceive, to his a&s;|toni&s;hment, that it was lady Caroline Albourne.</P>
<P>At this &s;ight, Alfred forgot all danger, and re&s;olved to die or &s;ave her: he accordingly, when he found the &s;teps fall from under him, cla&s;ped a po&s;t which &s;upported the &s;tory, and with an amazing agility &s;prang on the tottering floor of the room. He took her in his arms, but found no ladder &s;et for his de&s;cent; the people were afraid to come near, on account of the falling in of the building, which, would bury them in the ruins. He called to them; but his cries were vain; till Leonard, who was returned from conducting Matilda to a hou&s;e a little di&s;tance from the &s;pot, &s;eeing his ma&s;ter in &s;uch a &s;ituation, ran for the lad|der; but it was too late, for Alfred felt the place on which he &s;tood, mu&s;t &s;ink with them, before he could get to the ground by that method: he therefore, with remarkable in|trepidity, jumped from the part with lady Caroline in his arms, and fell on a feather bed which by chance had been thrown out at the beginning of the fire.</P>
<P>They were immediatly dragged &s;ome di&s;tance off, and in one minute after, the whole fabric fell to the ground.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the unfortunate lady Caroline may be better imagined than de&s;cribed; for even when &s;he had re|covered from the in&s;en&s;ibility which the thoughts of her danger had cau&s;ed, it was but to experience new mi&s;ery. Her father, without doubt, was buried in the ruins; &s;he
<PB N="116" REF="035833_0117_10093D659F1DC648">
had not yet &s;een her deliverer, nor knew of the heroic cou|rage that had been exerted in her behalf; for, from the moment the front of her chamber fell, &s;he &s;aw nor heard no more till her recovery in the hou&s;e to which &s;he had been conveyed. She was now attended by &s;everal per&s;ons, and her own woman &s;ervant, who had &s;lept in the back room, and leapt from the window at the fir&s;t alarm. At this period, while all were bewailing the lo&s;s of lord Al|bourne, he entered the room, &s;upported by two &s;ervants. Lady Caroline fainted, and afterwards fell into hy&s;terics, occa&s;ioned by the joy of &s;eeing her father, whom &s;he con|&s;idered as no more. He embraced her, and &s;hed tears of paternal tenderne&s;s for the &s;afety of his child.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip, when awaked by the alarm of fire, knew it would be &s;ome time before he could enter his daughter's chamber, as &s;he always bolted her door on the in&s;ide; and that the fright which &s;o &s;udden an information might give her, would mo&s;t likely prevent her from opening it at all; he therefore con&s;idered it would be be&s;t to get out at the back part as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and fly to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the front. With this idea, he attempted to de&s;cend the &s;tair-ca&s;e, but found it in flames: this &s;ight drove him di&s;|tracted. Without waiting for help, he jumped from the window, and was &s;o hurt by the fall, that he lay in&s;en&s;ible for &s;ome time, when one of his &s;ervants found him in that &s;ituation, and conducted him to the hou&s;e which was occu|pied by the other &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>Alfred Ma&s;erini, his &s;i&s;ter, and Leonard, were in another apartment; they neither of them judged it expedient to appear before lord Albourne, his daughter, or any of the &s;ervants, for fear a &s;udden exclamation of their name &s;hould di&s;cover them to tho&s;e who were about. They re&s;ol|ved, therefore, to remain private till morning, and then
<PB N="117" REF="035833_0118_10093D1EE9646F80">
have an interview with his lord&s;hip. The fire being part|ly extingui&s;hed, the people di&s;per&s;ed, and quiet was in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored.</P>
<P>At breakfa&s;t his lord&s;hip inquired in what manner his daughter e&s;caped death. They were both informed of the circum&s;tances relative to the behaviour of the young gen|tleman who had &s;o valiantly undertaken to re&s;cue her; and heard not the repeated prai&s;es of the ru&s;ties unconcern|ed. Lord Albourne's heart, as well as his daughter's, overflowed with gratitude, and they both reque&s;ted to &s;ee him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The woman of the hou&s;e &s;aid &s;he would call him directly, for that he had de&s;ired to be alone the remainder of the night. She left her noble gue&s;ts, and repaired to the room where Alfred &s;lept. Having knocked &s;everal times without receiving any an&s;wer, &s;he opened the door, and, to her a&s;toni&s;hment, found it empty. She immediately entered the chamber of his &s;i&s;ter, and &s;aw that was al&s;o de&s;erted. The &s;tables and loft where Leo|nard &s;lept, were al&s;o &s;earched; but neither cattle nor man could be &s;een.</P>
<P>In Alfred's de&s;erted apartment, they ob&s;erved a note which lay on the table; it was directed to lord Albourne: he received it, and the intelligence that the writer could no-where be found. His lord&s;hip read the following words:</P>
<LETTER>

<P>If lord Albourne was a&s;toni&s;hed at the elopement of lady Caroline's pre&s;erver, he was, if po&s;&s;ible, far more &s;urpri&s;ed at the contents of this note; and although he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ame obligation to him as to any other individual, yet he would rather have had lady Caroline's life &s;aved by any other per&s;on. He concluded Alfred was in debt, and was there|fore obliged to keep concealed. Lord Albourne was a no|bleman of the nice&s;t honour, and mo&s;t generous &s;entiments; he could not therefore con&s;ider him&s;elf happy in being obliged to a man who&s;e ill qualities he had only known, and, as a &s;tranger to his real character, dete&s;ted his princi|ples. He &s;trictly ob&s;erved what was mentioned in the note, and made an excu&s;e for the gentleman's &s;udden de|parture.</P>
<P>In private he acquainted his daughter with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> She &s;hed tears; his lord&s;hip &s;tarted: "I hope, Caroline," &s;aid he with &s;ome warmth, "you encourage not a partial|ity for a man to whom I have many times declared a total di&s;like."</P>
<P>"Your lord&s;hip, &s;urely, cannot blame the&s;e few marks of &s;en&s;ibility for one who has &s;aved my life, and by that, I flatter my&s;elf, de&s;erves, your gratitude as well as your daughter's."</P>
<P>"My mo&s;t &s;incere gratitude he certainly de&s;erves&punc; re|plied his lord&s;hip: "but yet I would rather he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have any recompen&s;e in the world than the affections <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my child.

<P>Lady Caroline &s;ighed; her under&s;tanding told her his lord&s;hip's arguments were ju&s;t; but her heart informed her &s;he mu&s;t &s;uffer in the acquie&s;cence to them.</P>

<P>LORD Albourne had ob&s;erved, from the fir&s;t evening of his daughter's introduction at Sir Peter Peviquil's, a growing partiality on her &s;ide towards the young French|man: and particular a&s;&s;iduities in his manner which &s;eem|ed calculated to gain the affection&punc; of any young lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whom they were addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">orougly convinced that the&s;e conjec|tures were well founded, determined to inquire more clo&s;e|ly into the character and principles of his new acquain|tance; he had received hints from &s;everal per&s;ons, that he was a man of no fortune; but wealth was the lea&s;t object of lord Albourne's con&s;ideration; his own income was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and noble, having, as an only &s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the whole e&s;tate and title of his father: he therefore wi&s;ely conceived that his child might find more &s;ub&s;tantial hap|pine&s;s in a good man, though with only a &s;mall patrimo|ny,
<PB N="120" REF="035833_0121_10093D6BB59911C0">
than by receiving a higher name and additional lux|uries, as the wife of a di&s;&s;ipated man of quality.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e ideas his lord&s;hip &s;crutinized the conduct of Alfred Ma&s;erini. He heeded not the envious tongue of calumny, but determined to be him&s;elf a &s;pectator of tho&s;e vices that &s;hould render him unfit for an alliance with lady Caroline. But he found the general voice to be too true, and more than once &s;aw him &s;eated among notorious &s;har|pers at a gaming-table Di&s;gu&s;ted at the &s;ight, he re&s;olved never to admit him into his family. Having informed his daughter of the re&s;olution he had taken, he could perceive, by the manner of her receiving the declaration, that Love had on

<P>Lord Albourne was now &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed, and re&s;olved on a &s;udden &s;cheme, to break off at once the connection.</P>
<P>He had received advice to travel, on account of his health, which had been in a declining &s;tate for &s;ome months. He con&s;idered this as a good opportunity to comply with the wi&s;hes of his friends; and by taking lady Caroline with him, the novelties of other countries, di&s;tance, and &s;e|paration, might break an acquaintance which threatened her happine&s;s for ever.</P>
<P>He accordingly ordered the &s;ervants to deny their young lady, whenever Mr. Ma&s;erini &s;hould call that day; and then gave immediate directions for a long journey, which
<PB N="121" REF="035833_0122_10093D254E587858">
he intended to take the next morning, having bu&s;ine&s;s of importance to tran&s;act in the country.</P>
<P>Lady Caroline was a&s;toni&s;hed, when &s;he was reque&s;ted by her father to accompany him, and prepare her ward|robe in as little time as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"Your lord&s;hip I &s;uppo&s;e means to make no great &s;tay: con&s;equently, I &s;hall have little occa&s;ion for many dre&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>"If I find, Caroline," returned lord Albourne, "that the air agrees with me, I may perhaps remain there &s;ome weeks, if not months; and, in that ca&s;e, &s;hall without doubt wi&s;h for your company. You had, therefore, better order the chief part of your clothes to be packed up: even your writing and drawing implements I would advi&s;e you to take with you."</P>
<P>The young lady was &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed and vexed at the &s;tay her father intended to make; but even to wi&s;h not to go with him, was, in her ideas, cruelty to a parent who had always been &s;o tenderly attached to her.</P>
<P>The next day they took leave of London. Lady Caro|line did not mention the circum&s;tance of &s;eeing Alfred at the turnpike gate. At a late hour in the evening they en|tered D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver, and &s;lept there that night. During &s;upper, his lord&s;hip opened his mind to his daughter; acquainted her with his motives for &s;o &s;uddenly leaving town, and his intentions of travelling through France and Italy, as he hoped change of climate would both benefit his health and drive from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a man unworthy of her e&s;teem.</P>
<P>"You might, my dear Caroline," concluded his lord|&s;hip, "have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to reproach me, had I li&s;tened to the tales of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but I had the evidence of my own &s;en&s;es, and therefore could not be mi&s;taken, in ob&s;erving Mr. Ma&s;erini to be a per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would in a cour&s;e of time being his wife to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">"</P>

Lady Caroline made no an&s;wer; but her looks &s;howed &s;he thought her father's proceedings right, although they were entirely again&s;t her own inclinations. The next morning they cro&s;&s;ed over to Calais, and travelled &s;lowly towards the Alps, when they &s;topped at that inn where our young adventurers arrived a few hours after.</P>
<P>It was not a wonder that lord Albourne &s;hould be cha|grined at the note he received; when it informed him that the very man who had given him &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s, and on who&s;e account he left England, had in a few days' time overtaken them, and, by a noble act of courage and genero&s;ity, bound him&s;elf by the &s;tronge&s;t ties, to the grat|itude of both his daughter and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip, however, was &s;oon convinced that his &s;up|po&s;ition on the cau&s;e of Alfred's departure was ill founded; but his knowledge of the actual rea&s;on of it &s;erved, if po&s;|&s;ible, to hurt him more than ever in that nobleman's opinion.</P>
<P>It will be now nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint the reader with tho&s;e circum&s;tances that occa&s;ioned the young travellers precipitate elopement from the inn.</P>
<P>Leonard was a &s;econd time going to retire to his bed, which was no better than a heap of &s;traw placed by the &s;ide of his hor&s;es, when a large paper, &s;tuck on the door of the &s;table, met his eye. Fatigued as he was, curio&s;ity prompted him to hold up the lanthorn which he had in his hand, in order to read the contents; when, to his a&s;toni&s;hment and horror, he preceived it to be an order for apprehending Alfred Ma&s;erini, as a de&s;erter from his regi|ment, and a large reward to be given to any one who would produce him.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed and alarmed at this intelligence, he &s;tood
<PB N="123" REF="035833_0124_10093D26D6BF1308">
&s;ome moments motionle&s;s. Having in &s;ome degree recov|ered, he ran back to the hou&s;o; fortunately the entrance was not fa&s;tened, and he arrived, without difficulty, at his ma&s;ter's chamber. He knocked, and Alfred an&s;wered: Leonard begged to be admitted. No &s;ooner had he entered the room, than he informed him of the adverti&s;ment which he had &s;een, and entreated his ma&s;ter to &s;et off again im|mediately. "I am perfectly well acquainted, &s;ir, with a way acro&s;s the Alps, and will be bound to conduct you &s;afe into Italy."</P>
<P>This information was the mo&s;t &s;evere trial Alfred had ever yet experienced; he now &s;aw his character and hon|our ruined, his name branded as that of a coward, and even publicly expo&s;ed as a villain, by a reward to be given for his per&s;on. "Leonard," &s;aid he, half frantic "take care of my &s;i&s;ter, and I will this moment fly and deliver my&s;elf up to my country; then I will explain my motives for my pre&s;ent behaviour, and die in a manner that &s;hall not di&s;grace my family."</P>
<P>"Alas, &s;ir," an&s;wered Leonard, "con&s;ider my young lady. I am a poor man, and little able to afford her that protection you reque&s;t: not but that I would die in her defence; yet I am afraid my exertions in her behalf would be only looked on with contempt."</P>
<P>Alfred was tortured with contending pa&s;&s;ions:&mdash;one mo|ment, his honour made him re&s;olve to give him&s;elf up a victim to the &s;entence of a de&s;erter; but then his &s;i&s;ter&punc; in the power of count D'Ollifont, (who might recover) pre|&s;ented her&s;elf to his fancy, nor was the idea of lady Caro|line ab&s;ent from his mind. A hope, a di&s;tant hope, &s;eem|ed to in&s;pire him with a wi&s;h to fly once more ignobly from pur&s;uit, and try his fortune in that part where his parents had experienced the mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="035833_0125_10093D7254AB07E8">
Leonard was overjoyed at this re&s;olution, and directly crept down &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">airs to the &s;table in order to prepare th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> hor&s;es; and Alfred promi&s;ed to follow in a little time. Having knocked at the door of his &s;i&s;ter's apartment, he reque&s;ted in a low voice that &s;he would ri&s;e immediately, dre&s;s her&s;elf, take every thing out of the room that belong|ed to her, and come to his chamber.</P>
<P>Matilda was a&s;toni&s;hed; but it was not a time for inqui|ries; &s;he accordingly did as he de&s;ired, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. In the mean time he wrote with a pencil tho&s;e few lines that were delivered to lord Albourne Being joined by his &s;i&s;ter, he took their trunk, and led her to the &s;table; when, being placed on her hor&s;e, they departed with as much expedition as the darkne&s;s of the morning would permit.</P>
<P>There was not a doubt but that an order from France for Alfred's return to his regiment, at a very &s;hort notice, had been &s;ent a few hours after he left his lodgings; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to adverti&s;e him as a de&s;erter, was a method equally &s;trange and uncommon.&mdash;In &s;hort, count D'Ollifont's in|terference &s;eemed to appear in the affair; and they greatly &s;u&s;pected it was through his friends, &s;ome of whom were &s;uperior officers, and others in great favour at court, that &s;uch cruel proceedings were occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>Alfred remained in a deep reverie; and it was from Leo|nard that his &s;i&s;ter learnt the rea&s;on for &s;o &s;udden and un|accountable a flight. They wore &s;ome miles from the hou&s;e by day-light, and halted at a &s;mall cottage for &s;ome refre&s;hment, before they began their journey on the Alps. They had here, fortunately, an opportunity of changing the three hor&s;es for two mules and a kind of carriage which would be more convenient and &s;afe for Matilda to travel in; and al&s;o prevent remarks, which the &s;ight of
<PB N="125" REF="035833_0126_10093D29D3049760">
other animals might have occa&s;ioned among the pea&s;ants. In about an hour they again &s;et off, and Leonard acted as driver the chief part of the way.</P>
<P>Nothing particular occurred during their journey acro&s;s the Alps, which was extremely difficult and tedious, ex|cept a vi&s;ible alteration in Alfred's health for the wor&s;e, and a &s;ettled deep melancholy in his &s;i&s;ter, which threat|ened a total decline in her con&s;titution. Leonard in vain &s;trove to point out to them the beauties of the country and the romantic &s;cenery which &s;urrounded them; their own misfortunes engro&s;&s;ed every idea; and the cloud of mi&s;ery, which had &s;o long been gathering over their heads, &s;eemed now ready to bur&s;t with full force and horror.&mdash;Their ar|rival in Italy was productive of little joy or comfort, as they had every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame papers had been publi&s;hed through that country. They &s;ecreted them&s;elves as well as po&s;&s;ible at every place where they &s;topped, u&s;ing the nice&s;t economy for fear of exhau&s;ting their little &s;tore; which, although it might la&s;t them a con&s;iderable time with frugality, yet, with extravagance, could be but of &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>Alfred had re&s;olved in his own mind, from their fir&s;t &s;etting off from Dover, to vi&s;it Gra&s;ville Abbey; he now con&s;idered it would be a place of great &s;ervice in point of &s;ecreting them from their enemies, as there was little doubt but &s;uper&s;tition had kept it entirely free from inhabitants or curious vi&s;itors. But the&s;e intentions he determined to keep from the knowledge of Matilda; for he well knew the idea of re&s;iding there would add greatly to tho&s;e &s;uffer|ings &s;he already experienced: and the circum&s;tances of the light in the we&s;t tower, the noi&s;e which was heard by their father, and his remarkable di&s;appearance, were &s;ubjects which his &s;i&s;ter dwelt on with horror, whenever &s;he read
<PB N="126" REF="035833_0127_10093D758EF4D3B0">
the manu&s;cript of her aunt. But he hoped to pur&s;uade her to remain there for &s;ome little time, and then con|&s;idered that &s;he would &s;oon become comfortable in it, even as a place of abode.</P>
<P>Leonard well knew the roads that led to the Abbey, as he had often &s;een it when young, and could well remem|ber the ho&s;pitality and goodne&s;s of the old count Ma&s;erini. To him Alfred privately conveyed his intentions, and re|que&s;ted him to bring them to the man&s;ion on a &s;udden, and unknown to Matilda. The man &s;eemed hurt on ac|count of his young lady, and begged leave to remind him that it would be cruel to di&s;tre&s;s her, when &s;he needed no more occa&s;ions for terror or alarm.</P>
<P>"I thank you for the caution," returned Alfred coolly; "but am not yet &s;o great a villain as to behave in the manner you &s;uppo&s;e."</P>
<P>Leonard looked confu&s;ed; his ma&s;ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ontinued&mdash;</P>
<P>"I will not even propo&s;e a favourable argument to keep her there again&s;t her own inclination. But you mu&s;t agree, that if Matilda could dive&s;t her&s;elf of idle terrors, and ac|quie&s;ce in the plan, it would in every re&s;pect be particu|larly fortunate, both in pre&s;erving our little property, and concealing us from the eye of malice or contempt."</P>
<P>With the&s;e intentions they rode &s;ome leagues each day, and, on the fifth morning from their fir&s;t entering Italy, found them&s;elves within &s;ix hours' travelling of Gra&s;ville Abbey. The clouds &s;eemed to indicate an approaching &s;torm; rain fell in large drops, and &s;everal claps of thun|der were heard at a di&s;tance. Matilda was alarmed, and begged they might alight at &s;ome place where they might find &s;helter till the tempe&s;t &s;hould in &s;ome degree abate. In vain they looked round for a cottage or hovel to an&s;wer their purpo&s;e; no &s;uch place could be &s;een; when their
<PB N="127" REF="035833_0128_10093D2C81E444A8">
attention was called off by the &s;ight of a young girl, &s;eem|ingly about &s;ixteen. Her hands were cla&s;ped, and her eyes lifted towards heaven. Her appearance &s;howed both terror and di&s;tre&s;s. Leonard drove to the &s;pot where &s;he &s;tood, and Alfred offered the &s;helter of their vehicle, which &s;he accepted with joy; and by her thanks for their kindne&s;s they perceived &s;he was a native of France. Matilda in|quired to what part &s;he was going. She an&s;wered, with an unaffected &s;implicity, "Any where." They were both a&s;toni&s;hed at the reply, but re&s;trained their curio&s;ity and de&s;ired Leonard to drive on.</P>
<P>The &s;torm had now blown over, though the clouds were &s;till gloomy and un&s;ettled; but the latter part of the day they again joined, and &s;eemed to foretel another war of elements. Vivid fla&s;hes of white lightning darted on the ground, and loud claps of thunder (which was now much nearer) bur&s;t over their heads. Matilda declared &s;he would rather put up with any &s;ituation, than travel while it la&s;t|ed; and Agnes (which was the name of the young girl) was extremely terrified. At that moment they perceived the turrets of Gra&s;ville Abbey ri&s;e above the trees which &s;urrounded it. Alfred ordered Leonard to drive immedi|ately to it.</P>
<P>Matilda <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;huddered, yet was a&s;hamed to confe&s;s her fears. It was now nearly dark, and they entered a grove of anci|ent cedars that led to the front gate. The lightning was horrid, and the thunder &s;eemed to &s;hake even the centre of the earth: both Agnes and Matilda were nearly in&s;en&s;i|ble when the carriage &s;topped before the Abbey. One wing &s;eemed entirely in ruins, but they had no time for ob&s;ervations. Leonard had not quitted the mule he rode on two minutes before the animal was &s;truck dead at his feet, and each expected the &s;ame fate. Alfred flew to the
<PB N="128" REF="035833_0129_10093DA83269C6E8">
gates, and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his &s;ervant, after &s;ome efforts, they yielded to their &s;trength, and bur&s;t open, being un|locked.</P>
<P>Leonard drove the carriage into the court; having pu&s;h|ed again&s;t the heavy folding doors that led to the internal part, they ea&s;ily opened, but with a con&s;iderable noi&s;e, that confirmed no one had entered this dreary man&s;ion for many years. Agnes and Matilda were carried into the hall, and the mules and vehicle put under a piazza.</P>
<P>Leonard having kindled a fire on the pavement with &s;ome faggots, by the help of a tinder-box which he had in his pocket, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were in &s;ome mea&s;ure recovered, and looked with horror <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the gloomy and de&s;olate appearance of the place that gave them &s;helter.</P>

<P>SUPERSTITION (though greatly encouraged by idle conver&s;ation and fabulous tales) is natural to mankind, and often inhabits the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e who&s;e valour and in|trepidity in other re&s;pects have been equally known and experienced.</P>

&s;cenery of Parm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, Placenza, Mirandola, and the river Po; while at the extremity of the pro&s;pect, in an oblique view, Venice might ju&s;t be ob&s;erved. The back front looked over Valentia, Ca&s;al, and Vercelli, and ter|minated in a di&s;tant &s;ight of Savoy.</P>
<P>But none of the&s;e countries could be &s;een but from the top ca&s;ements of the two towers; the lower part of the Abbey being entirely &s;urrounded by thick foliage, pines and cypre&s;s trees, with many ancient cedars.</P>
<P>The building was in every re&s;pect calculated to in&s;pire awe and &s;olemnity, both in the external and internal ap|pearance. After the death of the count Ma&s;erini, many &s;trange accounts were talked of by the pea&s;ants; and D'Ollifont's &s;udden departure from it, at the funeral of his uncle, &s;eemed to confirm tho&s;e reports that had before been circulated through the &s;urrounding country. From that time it was &s;hut up, without any of the furniture be|ing removed; and no one had been known to enter it till &s;ignor Ma&s;erini, &s;on to the late count, and father to Alfred and Matilda. His &s;udden and remarkable di&s;appearance rai&s;ed the horror of the place, if po&s;&s;ible, more than ever; even tho&s;e who had before laughed at the &s;uper&s;tition of their neighbours, were extremely alarmed at &s;o dreadful and uncommon an occurrence. No per&s;on ever walked be|yond the entrance of the grove that led to the gates; and the only human habitation that &s;tood near it was a cell which contained an old hermit, who had lived there ever &s;ince the Abbey had been for&s;aken, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the charity of the neighbouring cottagers.</P>
<P>The travellers remained in the hall till day light, when the &s;torm abated, and they began to wi&s;h for &s;ome repo&s;e. Leonard pulled two arm chairs, which &s;tood in the rece&s;s, towards the fire, and Agnes and Matilda &s;trove to &s;leep in
<PB N="132" REF="035833_0133_10093D771B435EC0">
them; while Alfred and his &s;ervant laid them&s;elves down on an old bench that &s;tood near the &s;pot. After &s;ome hours they awoke and found them&s;elves much refre&s;h|ed. Leonard was immediately di&s;patched to &s;ee that the gates were clo&s;e in the &s;ame manner as they were before, to prevent &s;u&s;picion of any one having pa&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>They then opened their portmanteau, and found they had provi&s;ions for that day: this circum&s;tance was ex|tremely fortunate, as they could have time to contrive &s;ome method of repleni&s;hing their &s;tore. Leonard had al&s;o got victuals for his &s;urviving mule. They had now an op|portunity to take a more particular account of their &s;itua|tion; and Alfred &s;milingly a&s;ked his &s;i&s;ter if &s;he had any objection to explore with him the apartments by day-light: &s;he cheerfully con&s;ented; but Agnes was terrified at the idea of attending them, and equally afraid of remaining in the hall by her&s;elf, but at la&s;t re&s;olved on the former.</P>
<P>The hall was of ancient architecture, but extremely no|ble, though heavy in the de&s;ign. It was &s;upported by large Gothic columns; the capitals were chiefly decayed; the &s;hafts were compo&s;ed of &s;tained marble; and though of a con&s;iderable height, the diameters were greater than the &s;trict rules of that kind of architecture would admit. The top opened in a large dome and gallery, the walls of which had exhibited beautiful paintings, that were now nearly de&s;troyed; a large painted &s;ky-light terminated the height; and additional light was received from four elevated ca&s;ements on different fides of the hall. Pila&s;ters of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions upwards &s;tood oppo&s;ite the pillars, between each of which were niches that held &s;tatues larger than life; the&s;e were in &s;ome pre&s;ervation, as the count had them placed when he fir&s;t came to the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Two large fire-places &s;tood at each and, which &s;eemed to &s;how that ho&s;pitality and the comforts of life had once
<PB N="133" REF="035833_0134_10093DC033EC7EE8">
been enjoyed in this dreary and melancholy abode. The pavement was of black and white marble, the &s;tones of which were of a con&s;iderable &s;ize. In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tood a large pair of heavy folding doors, that led to the apart|ments on the ea&s;t and we&s;t wings of the abbey. Two &s;tone &s;tair-ca&s;es appeared on each &s;ide, which wound to the chambers above. Alfred re&s;olved fir&s;t to examine the lower apartments, and accordingly opened the folding doors, which di&s;covered a &s;mall pa&s;&s;age, &s;upported by Tu&s;can pillars; at the further part of it was a de&s;cent of &s;everal &s;teps, which were in many parts broken and decay|ed; at the bottom of them was a pair of large iron gates, through which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y perceived the remains of an exten&s;ive and noble chapel; this part they &s;uppo&s;ed had &s;tood near|ly in the &s;ame &s;tate from the fir&s;t foundation of the build|ing, as then intended for a place of religious wor&s;hip. They re-a&s;cended the &s;teps, and di&s;covered in the pa&s;&s;age two large openings, which &s;eemed to lead to different &s;uites of apartments. They fir&s;t entered tho&s;e of the we&s;t wing. The furniture in the fir&s;t room had been extremely elegant, though antique; it was in tolerable pre&s;ervation, con&s;idering the number of years it had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> there without care; many noble paintings were yet hanging, but &s;o decayed by damps that it was impo&s;&s;ible to make out the &s;ubjects. The &s;econd room was rather larger than the fir&s;t, but in far wor&s;e condition; the tape&s;try was en|tirely de&s;troyed, and both the ca&s;ements and &s;hutters broke nearly to pieces; the columns which &s;upported it &s;eemed al&s;o rotten and decayed.</P>
<P>From this apartment they walked through many others that were in the &s;ame condition, and &s;howed no &s;igns of having contained any mortal in them for many years. In
<PB N="134" REF="035833_0135_10093D7A529343A8">
the la&s;t room there was a &s;trong door, which they perceiv|ed, by a window, opened into a court or terrace.</P>
<P>Having returned to the hall, they entered the apartments of the ca&s;t wing. They were &s;maller though more in number than tho&s;e they had left; and by the plainne&s;s of the internal part, they &s;uppo&s;ed them to have been offices for &s;ervants. At the extent of them there was a door of the &s;ame &s;ize with that they had ob&s;erved on &s;he other &s;ide, and which opened al&s;o to the other end of the terrace.</P>
<P>"The &s;ituation of this place," &s;aid Alfred, "&s;hows that the inhabitants left it on a &s;udden; but yet it is amazing that &s;o noble a building, and &s;uch elegant furni|ture, &s;hould have been left to peri&s;h by the ravages of time and neglect."</P>
<P>"I cannot &s;ay I am altogether &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed at that," an&s;wered Matilda: "for after &s;uch circum&s;tances happen|ing in it, for heaven's &s;ake who would willingly choo&s;e it for a habitation?"&mdash;Her brother &s;miled; and having again returned to the hall, they a&s;cended one of the &s;tair-ca&s;es, but &s;oon perceived that they both terminated in one land|ing. The Abbey here was not divided; the chambers were con&s;equently far more intricate: the apartments were &s;pa|cious, and had been nobly furni&s;hed; the beds were heavy and antique; but all nearly de&s;troyed. They however, after &s;ome trouble, contrived to change one thing with another, till they made up three tolerable beds. Two of them were in a large chamber, and the other clo&s;ely adjoin|ing&punc; They deferred, however, fini&s;hing their &s;earch till the next day&punc; on account of airing what they were to lie on at night. Leonard accordingly made a good fire in the hall, and the clothes were placed before it immediately. After another repa&s;t, Matilda begged Agnes to relate to them tho&s;e occurrences that cau&s;ed her to be expo&s;ed to the fury

of &s;o terrible a &s;torm. "Alas! Mademoi&s;elle," returned Agnes, "I &s;hould even before this have related to you my little &s;tory, had I not been afraid you would have con|demned my conduct; but at lea&s;t," continued the poor girl, with tears in her eyes, "you &s;hall never have rea&s;on to reproach me with ingratitude for the favours I have re|ceived from you."</P>
<P>Both Alfred and Matilda de&s;ired her, if the relation would bring fre&s;h grief to her memory, to decline it, as in that ca&s;e they would willingly &s;u&s;pend their curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Agnes declared that, though it might rai&s;e in her mind many &s;orrows, yet it would in the end give her plea&s;ure to make them acquainted wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h her little narritive.

<P>"MY grandfather and his wife were natives of France, and re&s;ided near Moulins. His cottage was &s;ituated in the deep de&s;cent of a beautiful valley, and his name was La Faril."</P>
<P>Alfred here looked at his &s;i&s;ter; they both recollected the name in their aunt's manu&s;cript, where he was &s;poken
<PB N="136" REF="035833_0137_10093D80855FB798">
of in the highe&s;t terms, as one who pre&s;erved them, at the hazard of his own life, in a cave near his hou&s;e, from the officers of ju&s;tice. They did not, however, interrupt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fair &s;peaker.</P>
<P>"They &s;upported them&s;elves comfortably by their in|du&s;try and economy, and were re&s;pected not only by the inhabitants of their little vale, but by all that knew them even at a di&s;tance from it.</P>
<P>"They had a &s;on and a daughter; the former was the elde&s;t, but it was to the latter they looked up for comfort and con&s;olation in their old age. Leolin had manife&s;ted from his birth a proud and haughty di&s;po&s;ition, which made him rebel again&s;t all controul, and be a&s;hamed to own his parents, on account of their inferior condition in life. Both tried in vain, by inculcating hone&s;t and indu&s;t|rious ideas, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ra&s;e from his bo&s;om tho&s;e dangerous and infamous principles which &s;eemed natural to him. All was however u&s;ele&s;s: he refu&s;ed to be a pea&s;ant, and determined to go to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aris, and &s;eek his fortune in that city.</P>
<P>"He there entered into the &s;ervice of a di&s;&s;ipated noble|man, as valet de chambre. In this &s;ituation he was in|troduced to &s;cenes of luxury, villainy, and di&s;honour; while every trait in his character, which had when a child only appeared at intervals (though enough to alarm his parents) now blazed forth with redoubled vigour, and de&s;|troyed tho&s;e few good qualities he had &s;hown in his youth: in &s;hort, he was both a game&s;ter and a &s;windler. His fa|ther received but one letter from him during three years; but reports of his mi&s;conduct were continually in circula|tion in that part of the country, although &s;o extremely re|tired. The health of both his parents was much injured by the&s;e accounts; and their only comfort was the litt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e

Sabina. About four years after Leolin had left his home, he returned to it, for the fir&s;t time, one night, at an unu|&s;ual hour, but greatly altered, not with the healthful bloom of youth upon his cheek, but feeble, emaciated, and an old man in con&s;titution, though only twenty-one years of age.</P>
<P>"His father and mother were greatly &s;hocked at the &s;ight of him, but far more &s;o when he demanded to be con|cealed in a cave that was at the bottom of the garden; they however lo&s;t no time in complying with his de&s;ire, as he &s;aid he expected to be followed by the officers of ju&s;tice in le&s;s than two hours, on account of a robbery he had committed: nor was his conjecture wrong; for early in the morning the cottage was &s;urrounded by &s;everal men; but their &s;earch proved ineffectual; for the cave was &s;o clo&s;ely concealed as to prevent any di&s;covery. He remain|ed at home &s;ome little time, but &s;hortly returned to tho&s;e vices which had already taken too fa&s;t hold on his inclina|tions, to &s;uffer him to relinqui&s;h them, while he had health or &s;trength to follow their pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>"The next news they heard of him was about &s;ix months after, when his father was conducted to Provence, where Leolin lay at the point of death, encompa&s;&s;ed with mi&s;ery, wretchedne&s;s and want; eaten up with di&s;ea&s;e, his &s;oul torn with remor&s;e for pa&s;t crimes, and &s;inking into eternity with a con&s;cience racked by the contending pa&s;&s;ions of horror and di&s;may. He, however, &s;urvived long enough to receive a parent's ble&s;&s;ing, who would, even then, have &s;acrificed his own life to have &s;aved that of a profligate and undutiful &s;on.</P>
<P>"After &s;eeing Leolin decently interred, the good old man return&eacute;d to his cottage overwhelmed with grief, yet with &s;ome hope of enjoying a few years of tranquillity,
<PB N="138" REF="035833_0139_10093D820DE68C48">
which might make him a recompen&s;e for pa&s;t misfortun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">. But how vain is the fore&s;ight of mortals! in a very little time he lo&s;t the beloved partner of his heart, who had &s;truggled with him through the early part of life, and been equally a partaker in his adver&s;ity and plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>"His health and &s;pirits &s;uffered now a greater &s;hock than ever, and every week vi&s;ibly altered him for the wor&s;e. His daughter Sabina had for &s;ome months received offers of marriage from Cyril, the &s;on of a neighbouring cottager; and the ceremony was &s;hortly to have taken place, had not the &s;udden death of her mother put it a&s;ide. But after &s;ome time they were joined together in the holy bands of wedlock; and La Faril &s;till remained with his child, who&s;e attendance and affection he now needed more than ever.</P>
<P>"I was born about twelve months after their marriage, and was greatly beloved by my parents and grandfather. I had ju&s;t attained my thirteenth year when my father's father died, and though every per&s;on had &s;uppo&s;ed him to be a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome little property, yet even his &s;on was a&s;toni&s;hed to find him&s;elf heir to a con&s;iderable for|tune. After the funeral, we were &s;urpri&s;ed to find my fa|ther intended to leave his native valley and cottage, to en|joy the luxuries of Paris. This news was like a thunder|bolt to my mother, who knew it would break her parent's heart to leave that place, where he had been born, brought up, and continued &s;o many years; and &s;he was certain it would equally di&s;tre&s;s him to be robbed of her company and attendance. In vain &s;he advi&s;ed her hu&s;band to give up all ideas of abandoning their cottage for di&s;&s;ipation and vice; but to purcha&s;e &s;ome land in that part, which would then be doubly dear to them.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="035833_0140_10093DC9EEBA6ED0">
"My father was deaf to all intreaties, and declared his intentions of &s;etting off in a &s;hort time. Our only hope was now that the &s;olicitations of the good La Faril would have more effect on him:&mdash;but alas! he was too weak, and too much &s;hocked, to make any exertion in the affair; and his prayers failed like tho&s;e of his daughter. The poor old man was con&s;equently obliged to be removed to the hou&s;e of a neighbour, while his beloved child was forced from him by a cruel hu&s;band, who&s;e ambition was kindled by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a little wealth. The cottage and goods being di&s;po&s;ed of, with many tears on the part of my mo|ther and me, we took leave of my grandfather and our na|tive vale. At the expiration of a day we found our&s;elves in the gay city of Paris: and being &s;ettled in hand&s;ome lodgings, the fir&s;t news we received was, the death of La Faril, who &s;urvived but a very &s;hort time after his daugh|ter's departure. It will be needle&s;s to enlarge on the grief that both my mother and I felt on the occa&s;ion; we even thought we could trace &s;ome &s;igns of remor&s;e and &s;orrow in the brea&s;t of my father.</P>
<P>We were &s;hortly introduced to tho&s;e gaities and vices which are &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute genteel life. Having been &s;ettled about &s;ix months in our apartments, my mothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> candidly a&s;ked my father what trade or profe&s;&s;ion he in|tended to follow, or in what manner he de&s;igned to turn his fortune to the be&s;t advantage: but he told us to enjoy our pre&s;ent ble&s;&s;ings, without troubling our&s;elves with painful ideas of what might happen on the morrow. The&s;e pernicious principles were certainly, in one re&s;pect, the ruin of us; for he heeded not the advice of his wife or real friends, but plunged into every extravagance that &s;eemed to gratify his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="035833_0141_10093D83F735E558">
"He, however, took &s;ome little care of my education, and I was in&s;tructed in every branch of u&s;eful learning.</P>
<P>"Matters continued in this &s;ituation for three years; during which time my father purcha&s;ed a hand&s;ome villa, and our hou&s;e was con&s;tantly crowded with company. His wife mo&s;t earne&s;tly entreated him to contract his expen&s;es; but her prayers were u&s;ele&s;s, and he &s;till an&s;wered in the &s;ame carele&s;s manner, 'Let to-morrow take care for it&s;elf.' We, neverthele&s;s, &s;aw him at times di&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ed and unhap|py, and he would return home in an evening, from &s;pend|ing the day abroad, nearly in a &s;tate of de&s;traction. My mother had &s;ometimes hinted to me, the cau&s;e of this &s;trange behaviour was gambling; and we were thoroughly convinced of it, when a man, one night, brought a note directed to him, and de&s;ired an an&s;wer to it immediately. Having opened it, we found it contained an appointment to a gaming-hou&s;e that evening.</P>
<P>"I need not de&s;cribe to you the fre&s;h anxiety this infor|mation gave us, nor the rage of my father at the di&s;covery of it: but we could now plainly tell when he was a favour|ite of fortune, and when not, by the different turns of his temper. Among the mo&s;t intimate of his friends was a Mon&s;ieur Le Selet. This man was a well known gambler, and withal a dangerous character in point of gallantry (as he &s;tyled it) among the ladies. He was a con&s;tant vi&s;itor; and we &s;eldom &s;at down to table but he was one of the party. Mon&s;ieur Le Selet, more than once, offended both my mother and my&s;elf by his behaviour to us in private, and we complained of it to my father; but he only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">allied us on our prudery as he called it; and declared him to be a man who had his intere&s;t at heart.</P>
<P>"The&s;e gloomy &s;its, which had only appeared at inter|vale, now returned more and frequently, in&s;omuch
<PB N="141" REF="035833_0142_10093DCBA6F03748">
that we really thought his brain was affected, and entreat|ed him to have &s;ome advice. But he would then fly into a violent pa&s;&s;ion: nor was it till three months after, that he confe&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e of it was the entire lo&s;s of his fortune; and not only that, but he was a debtor to Mon&s;ieur to a very con&s;iderable amount.</P>
<P>"At the time of this confe&s;&s;ion, Le S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t entered the room and reque&s;ted to &s;peak with my father in private&punc; we accordingly retired to an apartment &s;ome di&s;tance from that we left. In about two hours, while we were wonder|ing at their long conferrence, we were very much alarmed by hearing the bell in that room ring violently. Soon af|ter, we heard the &s;ervants in a kind of confu&s;ion, and were ju&s;t going to leave the chamber in order to inquire the rea|&s;on for &s;uch proceedings, when we were met by the hou&s;e|keeper. 'My ma&s;ter! my ma&s;ter!' was all &s;he could &s;ay. In vain we a&s;ked her to explain her meaning; &s;he could utter no other words.</P>
<P>"We were therefore obliged to run to the parlour we had before left&mdash;when, judge our feelings at &s;eeing my father and Mon&s;ieur Le Selet both weltering in their blood. We ran to the former: he had ju&s;t recovered from a fainting fit, and languidly looked up. We knelt by him and wept; he &s;eemed affected; and tho&s;e eyes which were half clo&s;ed by death, &s;hed tears of &s;orrow and repentance when it was too late.</P>
<P>"My wife! my child!' he cried in a voice &s;carcely ar|ticulate, 'I have injured you much: I have taken you from the peaceful habitation of innocence, to be &s;urround|ed by vice and villainy, to experience poverty, di&s;tre&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion. Oh! my God!' he exclaimed with fervency, 'look down upon them; &s;hield them with thy mercy from

the iron rod of tyranny and inju&s;tice; nor condemn them for the wickedne&s;s of him who now implores thy aid.'</P>
<P>"His voice &s;ailed him; he fell into convul&s;ions, and expired. Greatly as we had to complain of his conduct, yet our grief was exce&s;&s;ive&punc; A &s;urgeon had been &s;ent for, but all medical aid was u&s;ele&s;s. The wound he received, as we afterwards under&s;tood, was by his own hand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;ervant had, from the hall, overheard the conver&s;ation. Mon&s;ieur Le Selet had called upon him that day for the payment of the &s;um he owed. My father begged the in|terval of a week to di&s;charge it; this the former ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, but told him the whole might on one condition be forgiven. He a&s;ked with eagerne&s;s by what method he &s;hould cancel the obligation; when Le Selet gave him a paper: this paper a &s;ervant had &s;natched from the floor, and pre&s;ented to us: it was a bond by which my father was to re&s;ign his child to the arms of a villain, without any ceremony or articles of marriage. The horror he con|ceived at this propo&s;al was too much for him to &s;upport, and he gave way at once to the pa&s;&s;ions of revenge and de&s;|pair: he &s;eized a dagger, and plunged it into the brea&s;t of the infamous Le Selet; then rang the bell violently, and afterwards, with the &s;ame hand, &s;truck the bloody &s;teel to his own heart. Mon&s;ieur Le Selet was removed to ano|ther chamber, but no hopes entertained of his recovery.</P>
<P>"The wound, however, we were informed, &s;eemed more favourable after a few days; and we reque&s;ted that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> might be taken from the hou&s;e as &s;oon as a removal would not endanger his life.

and accordingly took leave of Paris, and &s;oon found our&s;elves before that cottage which we had once called our own, and where the remembrance of pa&s;t felicity made our pre&s;ent misfortunes more poignant.</P>

<P>"Neither his friends nor my mother had any objection to this match, though the latter would frequently &s;ay, &s;he thought my per&s;on might command a richer hu&s;band. On the evening before that day which was to have united us, as we were &s;itting before our cottage, &s;ometimes joining in the ru&s;tic dance, we were &s;uddenly &s;topped in our amu&s;e|ment by the arrival of a gentleman and his &s;ervant. The former advanced with a corteous air: but judge of my a&s;toni&s;hment and horror, when I perceived it to be Mon|&s;ieur Le Selet. He &s;eemed perfectly recovered, and reque&s;t|ed to &s;peak with my mother alone.</P>
<P>"I trembled at the re&s;ult of their di&s;cour&s;e, which con|tinued &s;ome time: but all my mi&s;eri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s were complete, when my mother informed me, that mon&s;ieur, having thoroughly repented of his former ill conduct and beha|viour, now offered, as an atonement, to make me his wife. He &s;prang to embrace me, but I &s;hrunk from his arms, and fainted away. On my recovery they were each &s;tand|ing by me and entreated me to di&s;card my pre&s;ent lover; while the artful Le Selet talked in &s;o in&s;inuating a manner, as to bring over my mother entirely to his favour; for &s;he

&s;uppo&s;ed it would &s;ecure a hand&s;ome independence for her child. But this conver&s;ation had no effect on me, and they each retired with anger, and I with grief and di&s;tre&s;s. But I determined that night to leave them all. Whether you will blame my conduct, I know not, mademoi&s;elle; but I was certain that mon&s;ieur was by no means the re|pentant per&s;on he &s;eemed to be; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ven if he had been, I never could have liked him for a hu&s;band. I was al&s;o &s;ure that my mother could get a living in the &s;ame employ|ment as my&s;elf; for it had been agreed that &s;he &s;hould take my &s;chool after I was married. With the&s;e ideas I packed up a few clothes, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h a little money, in a bundle, and left the cottage as &s;oon as I thought my mother was a&s;leep. I had not yet, however, re&s;olved to what part I &s;hould go, but determined to apply to a carrier whom I had known for &s;ome time. He was to &s;et out on a long journey early in the morning, and he lived about a mile di&s;tant. By the time I arrived there, he was ju&s;t going to &s;et off. The man's &s;urpri&s;e was exce&s;&s;ive to &s;ee me, who he &s;uppo&s;ed was to have been made a wife that day. I explained to him the rea&s;ons for my vi&s;it, and threw my|&s;elf on his protection: he readily granted it, and told me he was going to Italy. This information gave me great plea&s;ure, as I thought I might there get employment, and conceal my real name and family.</P>
<P>"We had not entered this country above two days, be|fore Ba&s;il (the carrier's name) was taken ill; his di&s;order proved violent, and in le&s;s than a week he was no more. I was nece&s;&s;itated to &s;ell his cart and the whole of his goods to pay the expen&s;es of his funeral and illne&s;s. I now found my&s;elf in a &s;trange place, without money or friends. The people, however, at the hou&s;e where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

had died, informed me there was a family a few miles di&s;|tant who wanted a dome&s;tic. I accordingly applied: but how great was my di&s;appointment to find they were ju&s;t provided with one! I found the whole of my little proper|ty would &s;upport me but three days longer, and began &s;eriou&s;ly to repent leaving my cottage, when I was over|taken by that violent &s;torm, which proved one of the hap|pie&s;t incidents of my life, by introducing me to your friend&s;hip, care, and genero&s;ity; to which I mo&s;t certainly owe my exi&s;tence." Here the poor girl bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and concluded her &s;tory.</P>

<P>BOTH Alfred and Matilda thanked Agnes for the reci|tal of her narrative: they pitied her misfortunes, and pro|mi&s;ed to protect her as long as it was in their power. Not only their own feelings at the time prompted them to this, but gratitude for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance their parents had received from her family. After &s;ome further conver&s;ation, the
<PB N="146" REF="035833_0147_10093D8E9BC3F8A0">
bed furniture was carried to the rooms above; and, having partook of a &s;light &s;upper, they retired to their apartments. The chambers, however, &s;eemed extremely cold, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> begged Leonard would make up a little fire of fag|gots in each of them.</P>
<P>This was accordingly done; and Agnes having lighted a wax taper, which &s;he placed on a large marble flab, they took leave of Alfred for the night, who, with his faithful &s;ervant, entered the room adjoining.</P>
<P>"Before we go to re&s;t," &s;aid Matilda, "I will take a more particular &s;urvey of this chamber."</P>
<P>Agnes trembled; Matilda took the taper and walked round it. The apartment was not &s;o large as many, but had equally the &s;ame gloomy appearance. The bed had formerly been noble and elegant, but was now partly de|cayed; the high and heavy cornice of it &s;eemed rotted by time; the furniture, they could ju&s;t perceive, had been of crim&s;on velvet; but the curtains were now, in many parts, entirely threadbare. An old-fa&s;hioned cabinet and dre&s;|&s;ing-table, both of which had been ornamented with gilded figures, and &s;tood in a gothic rece&s;s, by the dim light &s;eemed in form to repre&s;ent a tomb. Matilda in vain &s;trove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o open the former; it was locked, nor could &s;he find any key. The wain&s;cotting was hung round with large pic|tures; but, except one, they were all nearly de&s;troyed, &s;o as to make it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover the &s;ubjects. That which was in &s;ome pre&s;ervation was the portrait of a man, in an Italian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, at full length. He &s;eemed of middle &s;ize, and elegant figure; but the countenance was melan|choly and dejected, while he re&s;ted with one arm on the fragment of a grave-&s;tone. Matilda gazed on it for a con&s;iderable time; it was extremely like the miniature of her father, which &s;he wore in her bo&s;om. She &s;tood in
<PB N="147" REF="035833_0148_10093DD3CA77F268">
&s;uch a &s;ituation that the eyes &s;eemed to look full at her. Painful and horrid ideas now aro&s;e in her mind; &s;he al|mo&s;t fancied &s;he &s;aw the features move: the thought over|came her: &s;he &s;huddered, &s;unk in a chair, and bur&s;t into a flood of tears. Agnes had attentively ob&s;erved her, and now joined her tears with tho&s;e of Matilda; yet, with un|affected &s;implicity, &s;trove to give her comfort and con&s;ola|tion. Her efforts at la&s;t &s;ucceeded; and, drying her tears, the former retired to a re&s;tle&s;s pillow.</P>
<P>It was a con&s;iderable time before Matilda could clo&s;e her eyes; the misfortunes that encompa&s;&s;ed her appeared now more terrible than ever. Agnes was in a &s;erene &s;leep; all was &s;ilent and gloomy: her eyes wandered over the de&s;o|late chamber; and &s;he could &s;till &s;ee by the &s;udden light of the wood fire, which was dying away, but now and then blazed at intervals, the face of the picture, which &s;till &s;eemed to look at her. The ember was at la&s;t entirely extingui&s;hed, and the room was left in total darkne&s;s, ex|cept from the flame of the wax taper. At length, tired out with melancholy and terrific recollections, &s;he fell into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;lumber.</P>
<P>Horrid vi&s;ions and gha&s;tly figures now floated on her brain. Her father approached, covered with blood, and with an angry tone, called on her to revenge his murder She &s;tarted, turned, and again compo&s;ed her&s;elf to re&s;t but it was impo&s;&s;ible. She now &s;aw her&s;elf in an apart|ment of the abbey that was hung with black; in the mid|dle of which lay a corp&s;e in &s;tate: &s;he walked up to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> coffin: a voice whi&s;pered her it was her grandfather. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> countenance was black; and it &s;truck her he was poi&s;one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> At that moment count D'Ollifont appeared; he attempte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to force her from the &s;pot; but, at the apparition of her father, which then a&s;cended, with an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> palene&s;s, and

disfigured with wounds, he fled, and Matilda, in the &s;trug|gle of horror and affliction, again awoke. In &s;hort, dur|ing the whole night her mind was &s;o entirely di&s;ordered by unea&s;y &s;lumbers, that &s;he aro&s;e in the morning with a con&s;iderable degree of fever, and by no means refre&s;hed. It was remarkably fine, and &s;he ventured to open the hea|vy ca&s;ement of her chamber. There was no danger of being ob&s;erved; the high trees that &s;urrounded the build|ing made it impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could be perceived but by tho&s;e in the inner part. The air refre&s;hed her, but the languor of her &s;pirits &s;till continued.</P>
<P>The breakfa&s;t, which Agnes had prepared with the ut|mo&s;t neatne&s;s, was &s;erved in the fir&s;t apartment next the hall. Leonard had got up very early, and cleaned it out; and the room now wore a far more comfortable appear|ance than it had done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> day before. Alfred noticed the pale looks of his &s;i&s;ter&punc; and a&s;ked, with a &s;mile, if &s;he had been di&s;turbed by any of the gho&s;ts. She declared &s;he had not been in the lea&s;t alarmed; and each an&s;wering in the &s;ame manner, their fears of &s;upernatural intru&s;ion partly vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>They now con&s;ulted the be&s;t method to procure provi|&s;ions, which mu&s;t be done that day, with &s;everal other articles: at la&s;t it was agreed that Leonard &s;hould take a ba&s;ket, and go out of the abbey &s;o as to be &s;een by no one in the way to it: and that he &s;hould mix with other per|&s;ons in the public market, where he could purcha&s;e what he wanted, and perhaps gain &s;ome intelligence concerning their re&s;idence, and other circum&s;tances relative to the count&punc; but Alfred de&s;ired him by no means to force the conver&s;ation, as it might rai&s;e curio&s;ity in the pea&s;antry to know who and what he was. This matter being &s;ettled,
<PB N="149" REF="035833_0150_10093DD7712BF3A0">
Leonard was &s;hortly equipped, and &s;allied forth with the utmo&s;t caution.</P>
<P>Alfred now propo&s;ed to his &s;i&s;ter to examine tho&s;e apart|ments they had not had time to look at the night before. Agnes &s;aid &s;he now had courage enough to &s;tay in the great hall, which &s;he had much rather do, and employ her&s;elf in preparing the dinner.</P>
<P>Alfred and Matilda accordingly a&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and walked through the &s;uite of rooms they had before &s;een. They then cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal others, larger and far more heavy. The&s;e terminated in a pa&s;&s;age &s;upported by &s;mall columns, and arched over in the Gothic &s;tyle. This place was extremely dark; they, however, with &s;ome difficulty, pa&s;&s;ed it, and entered, by a pair of folding doors, a more &s;pacious apartment then they had yet &s;een, and, if po&s;&s;ible, more gloomy. It had been entirely hung with black, and, from every appearance, had contained a corp&s;e that had lain there in &s;tate at &s;ome former period. Several pieces of tapers were &s;till &s;tanding in black gla&s;&s;es; and in the mid|dle &s;tood bearers for the purpo&s;e of &s;upporting a coffin; but there was now only the remains of a large plume of black feathers.</P>
<P>Matilda thought of her dream, and trembled. Alfred him&s;elf &s;eemed at fir&s;t &s;truck with awe, but pre&s;ently reco|vering him&s;elf, laughed at his &s;i&s;ter, and &s;trove to keep up his own &s;pirits by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">allying Matilda on her fears. She en|treated him to return; the gloomy horror of this chamber overcame her, and &s;he found her&s;elf extremely faint. He placed her on a kind of couch, that had al&s;o been covered with black velvet, and made &s;everal efforts to open the windows: this was, however, to no purpo&s;e; but after &s;ome trouble h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pulled down a part of the broken &s;hutters,
<PB N="150" REF="035833_0151_10093D920CADC9E0">
and con&s;equently received more light, which had before only entered from an opening at the top.</P>
<P>Matilda in a few minutes recovered, but declared &s;he would proceed no further. Alfred per&s;uaded her to a&s;cend the &s;tairs that wound round the we&s;t tower; but &s;he po|&s;itively refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed much to &s;ee the apartment which, by his aunt's manu&s;cript he was informed, terminated, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, the &s;earch of his father. But his &s;i&s;ter ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing to go any further, they returned to the hall. Ag|nes noticed the dejected looks of Matilda, but did not in|quire the cau&s;e. Alfred re&s;olved within him&s;elf to exa|mine the we&s;t tower the following day, and &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity concerning the my&s;tery of that extraordinary chamber.</P>
<P>Agnes was in far better &s;pirits than &s;he had been in &s;ince their meeting, and tried every way to comfort and entertain her dejected friends. Both felt the kindne&s;s of her intention, and acquainted her with mo&s;t of the cir|cum&s;tances relative to their misfortunes: there were, how|ever, &s;ome events they thought proper to conceal.</P>
<P>Lady Caroline Albourne was, however, &s;till one of the chief objects of Alfred's thoughts. He loved her, yet was con&s;cious he had not even merited her e&s;teem. By her manner, ju&s;t before he left England, he flattered him&s;elf he could perceive innocent traits of a confe&s;&s;ion of more than a common regard for him. But even though his conjectures &s;hould prove right, her prudence, her under|&s;tanding, mu&s;t have told her to tear from her heart a man who, by the conduct he then pur&s;ued, mu&s;t bring her to wretchedne&s;s, want and mi&s;ery. But there was yet even a greater misfortune to &s;trike him with remor&s;e. His name, his character, were tarni&s;hed with di&s;honour. That name
<PB N="151" REF="035833_0152_10093DDBF449AA78">
which, he had been proud to &s;ay, had not &s;hamed the fa|mily it belonged to, and that nicety of honour which is had been his utmo&s;t pride to pre&s;erve, were now, through folly and extravagance, ruined by the &s;landerous tongue o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> calumny, both in England and his own country. In the former it was mo&s;t likely he would receive the appellation of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in and a &s;wind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er; in the latter he would be branded as a ba&s;e, mean, cowardly de&s;erter from the &s;er|vice of his country; a di&s;grace to France and the noble profe&s;&s;ion he had been brought up to&mdash;the defence of his country's rights.</P>
<P>"Damned ideas!" he would exclaim, in a voice of frantic rage. His &s;i&s;ter and Agnes were alarmed. He beg|ged their pardon:&mdash;it was the recollection of former di&s;|tre&s;s that cro&s;&s;ed his brain at that moment. Matilda plainly peeceived his impetuo&s;ity of temper broke out at every interval when the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ollection of his folly, and the mi&s;ery it had brought them to, intruded on his memory. She therefore &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided to mention any topic in di&s;cour&s;e that might lead to a remembrance of di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Her griefs were con&s;equently buried in her own bo&s;om; yet they were not le&s;s poignant than tho&s;e of her brother. She loved Mr. Milverne; but every hope of &s;eeing him again appeared almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible. His letter, which they received at Dover, mentioned that he would join them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible in Italy; but they had little thought of an occurrence happening that obliged them to keep more con|cealed in this place, than their &s;ituation might have requir|ed them to have done, had they remained in England. Nor was it likely Mr. Milverne &s;hould even have an idea that they were inhabitants of Gra&s;ville Abbey. The more &s;he thought on tho&s;e &s;ufferings &s;he had experienced &s;ince
<PB N="152" REF="035833_0153_10093D98C0D96840">
her mother's death, the more &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed how &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> had &s;urvived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uch a &s;eries of misfortunes; but it fully con|vinced her that the Supreme Being con&s;tantly &s;upport tho&s;e who tru&s;t in him, though they may for a time be or|dained to bear a load of adver&s;ity and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Leonard returned in about two hours, laden with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> purcha&s;es he had made. He acquainted them that he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> been taken no particular notice of; but, mingling with other per&s;ons, had bought commodities without receiving any di&s;agreeable que&s;tions. This was plea&s;ing intelligence, and they &s;at down to dinner with &s;ome degree of cheerful|ne&s;s. But yet there was &s;omething in Leonard's counte|nance which &s;howed he had been greatly chagrined, and that he had heard more than he cho&s;e to communicate. At the latter part of the day he reque&s;ted to &s;peak with his ma&s;ter alone.</P>
<P>Alfred immediately granted his reque&s;t, and they a&s;cend|ed to their chamber.</P>
<P>Matilda was a &s;ilent &s;pectator of this my&s;terious beha|viour. Agnes was extremely alarmed; &s;he was certain, &s;he &s;aid, from Leonard's behaviour, that he mu&s;t have re|ceived &s;ome very dreadful intelligence; and in all pro|bability he thought it of too terrible a nature for them to be informed of.</P>
<P>Matilda &s;miled, and &s;trove to di&s;pel her fears, but was her&s;elf very much hurt. Agnes's conjecture was by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> means unlikely; yet &s;he felt her&s;elf &s;lighted at not being made a confidant in the affair. Their conference la&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> near two hours. When they returned to the parlour Leo|nard's countenance was &s;till more gloomy, while Alfred &s;trove to a&s;&s;ume a gaiety foreign to his heart. Their &s;up|per was a &s;ilent meal; each &s;eemed ab&s;orbed in melancho|ly reflections; and, after &s;ome little time, they retired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their apartments.</P>

<P>ANOTHER &s;leeple&s;s night was pa&s;&s;ed by Matilda; and Agnes reque&s;ted &s;he would take her breakfa&s;t before &s;he aro&s;e for the day. She therefore acquainted Alfred with his &s;i&s;ter's indi&s;po&s;ition. He was extremely concerned, and far more &s;o to ob&s;erve her dejected manner and pale countenance, when &s;he joined them at dinner. Leonard &s;eemed rather more cheerful than he had been the night before; but his ma&s;ter &s;till retained a gloomy &s;adne&s;s, that &s;howed &s;ome cau&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s lay heavy at his heart. Both &s;urveyed Matilda with a &s;crutini&s;ing eye, and Alfred after &s;ome little time a&s;ked, with a pretended air of indifference, if &s;he had re&s;ted as free from di&s;turbance as the night before.</P>
<P>It would not have been difficult for a common per&s;on to have perceived he pau&s;ed with unu&s;ual anxiety for an an&s;wer, though he &s;trove as much as po&s;&s;ible to conceal that emotion which was vi&s;ible to all. She told him &s;he had. This reply &s;eemed to give him con&s;iderable plea|&s;ure; and on her returning the que&s;tion, he al&s;o an&s;wered in the affirmative. The alteration in his manner continu|ed but a few moments, and he again relap&s;ed into his for|mer melacholy. He new mentioned his intention of exa|mining the rooms in the we&s;t tower, and a&s;ked Leonard to accompany him in his re&s;earches. Matilda &s;aid, languidly, that &s;he al&s;o meant to be of the party; at which declara|tion her brother looked very much chagrined.</P>
<P>"I rather think, Matilda," &s;aid he, "you had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> decline it; the coldne&s;s and damps of tho&s;e de&s;erted cham|bers

<P>She thought it might amu&s;e her, and was certain the walk would be of &s;ervice. Agnes attended; and they opened the large heavy door that &s;howed the winding &s;tone &s;tair-ca&s;e of the we&s;t tower. They found it very di&s;agree|able to a&s;cend; the place having been &s;o long for&s;aken, that large webs of du&s;t and dirt almo&s;t impeded their pa&s;|&s;age. They at length, however, arrived at the fir&s;t land|ing-place, where two apartments appeared&mdash;the one to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> right, the other to the left. They entered the former. I was a &s;mall &s;quare room, lighter than many they had &s;ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the abbey, but entirely clear from furniture; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he left was of the &s;ame &s;ize, but contained &s;everal imple|ments of war, among which were &s;words, &s;hields, &s;pears and a few fire-arms, a trumpet and drum, with other in|&s;truments of martial mu&s;ic: but all of them were in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> repair.</P>
<P>They again a&s;cended the continuation of the &s;tone &s;tai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ca&s;e, and found them&s;elves on the &s;econd landing.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> apartments on this floor were of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions; tho&s;e below, but had been far better furni&s;hed.

this blood was their father's! the idea &s;truck each of them. Agnes was greatly &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cked and terrified; Leo|nard conver&s;ed with con&s;iderable emotion in private with his ma&s;ter for &s;ome minutes, while Matilda, unable to bear her own feelings, bur&s;t into a flood of tears. After an hy&s;teric fit of weeping, &s;he found her&s;elf much better; and, having clo&s;ed the apartments, they de&s;cended to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arlour.</P>
<P>Some hours were again &s;pent by Alfred and Leonard in a private conference above. Both &s;till retained a &s;ettled me|lancholy on their features; while Agnes was more a&s;toni&s;h|ed, and Matilda more alarmed, than ever. The rea&s;on of her brother's &s;ecre&s;y &s;he could by no means di&s;cover; hitherto &s;he had been made acquainted with every circum|&s;tance concerning their &s;ituation; but Alfred was now &s;ilent even on general topics, and only put confidence in his &s;ervant. Her pride forbade her to a&s;k que&s;tions, yet her curio&s;ity prompted her to the humiliation, as being the only means of gratifying it. Evening approached: their &s;upper was again a &s;ilent meal, and they retired without any conver&s;ation having pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Agnes was &s;oon in a profound &s;leep; but Matilda's thoughts on her brother's behaviour robbed her of repo&s;e. It was now the la&s;t hour of night, and &s;he &s;trove again to compo&s;e her&s;elf to re&s;t, when &s;he thought &s;he heard her brother's voice; yet &s;he con&s;idered &s;he mu&s;t be deceived, as both Leonard and he had been in their apartments near two hours. The wind was extremely high; Matilda how|ever &s;till li&s;tened, and found &s;he was not mi&s;taken. A li&s;tener &s;he dete&s;ted; but &s;he thought her pre&s;ent &s;ituation took every &s;tigma from the character. She was, however, &s;till irre&s;olute in what manner to act, when a loud word
<PB N="156" REF="035833_0157_10093D9BD254CB78">
from her brother made her determined to hear more. Having accordingly thrown over her a night-gown, &s;he crept to the door. All was &s;ilent again for &s;ome time: but after an in|terval of many minutes, &s;he heard her brother check Leo|nard for talking &s;o loud; "Matilda," &s;aid he, "may not yet be a&s;leep." They then continued &s;o low that &s;he could not even under&s;tand one word. After another inter|val, Leonard an&s;wered to a que&s;tion which Alfred a&s;ked him, that "It was not the time."</P>
<P>"If I die in the attempt," &s;aid Alfred "I will unravel this my&s;tery: and if once&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here a violent gu&s;t of wind rattled through the chambers, and &s;he was unable to di&s;tingui&s;h their di&s;cour&s;e, though they &s;till continued talking. At length, however, &s;he heard Leonard &s;ay, "I will be very careful, &s;ir: you may depend upon my fidelity."</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake," continued Alfred, "follow it to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he utmo&s;t: but at all events do not di&s;cover&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here again the wind drowned their voices; and &s;hortly after, &s;he heard them retire for the night.</P>
<P>Matilda, chilled with horror and uncertainty, returned to her bed, and fell into a di&s;turbed &s;lumber. In the morn|ing &s;he appeared at breakfa&s;t, though her looks plainly told the &s;tate of her mind.</P>
<P>"Leonard," &s;aid her brother, "is this morning going again to the public market." Matilda was a&s;toni&s;hed; &s;he knew they were in want of no provi&s;ion. Alfred wi&s;h|ed to procure &s;ome wine, an article he was certain they were all in need of.</P>
<P>"But &s;urely," an&s;wered his &s;i&s;ter, "Leonard purcha&s;ed enough when he was la&s;t there."</P>
<P>"True," &s;aid he "but we have had an accident, and broke nearly all the bottles which were full."</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="035833_0158_10093DE30DFC1018">
Although &s;uch an accident was not impo&s;&s;ible, yet Ma|tilda greatly doubted the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion; and in her brother's manner &s;he thought &s;he could perceive an em|barra&s;&s;ment, which &s;howed it was merely an excu&s;e to keep from her the real cau&s;e of Leonard's errand. He, how|ever, &s;et off in a little time, equipped the &s;ame as when he before left the Abbey, and u&s;ing the like caution at leav|ing it.</P>
<P>After his departure they walked on the terrace which ex|tended from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t end of the building. Ag|nes was &s;ome di&s;tance from them&punc; when Matilda con&s;ider|ed that this would be a good opportunity to mention to her brother the great alteration &s;he had noticed in him, &s;ince his long and &s;ecret conference with Leonard. Alfred at fir&s;t &s;eemed only to laugh at her fears, and wi&s;hed to per|&s;uade her &s;he was mi&s;taken; but &s;he urged the matter &s;o clo&s;e that he at la&s;t confe&s;&s;ed Leonard's information that night had given him con&s;iderable unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid Matilda with quickne&s;s, "let me &s;hare in that di&s;tre&s;s; which will be far better than to remain in this horrid &s;u&s;pen&s;e."</P>
<P>"That is impo&s;&s;ible," returned Alfred; "you cannot, mu&s;t not, be acquainted with the affair."</P>
<P>His vehemence alarmed her.</P>
<P>"Is then the circum&s;tance of &s;o &s;ecret a nature, that I, who have hitherto been made a partner in the knowledge of all tho&s;e misfortunes that have befallen us, mu&s;t not now know that which your &s;ervant is privy to, and which may concern me equally with your&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"Be not offended, Matilda, if I tell you again it is im|po&s;&s;ible that in this ca&s;e I &s;hould gratify your wi&s;h: but be a&s;&s;ured every method I take will be for your good and &s;afe|ty;
<PB N="158" REF="035833_0159_10093DA0798D75A0">
nor mu&s;t you be &s;urpri&s;ed at any remarkable behaviour in me at different intervals, or terrify your&s;elf at any un|common occurences in this Abbey, as our re&s;idence here is now more nece&s;&s;ary than ever."</P>
<P>"Have you then &s;een any thing more than common?" &s;aid his &s;i&s;ter, with great emotion.</P>
<P>"With re&s;pect to this, too, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me," an&s;wer|ed Alfred. "At all events, however, we have one con&s;ola|tion; that tho&s;e who tru&s;t in the Supreme Being need never fear the interruption of decea&s;ed per&s;ons."</P>
<P>Agnes at this moment overtook them, and he hurried from his &s;i&s;ter with con&s;iderable precipitation into the hall.</P>
<P>Matilda &s;tood motionle&s;s for &s;ome minutes.</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure madam," &s;aid Agnes, "&s;ignor Ma&s;erini has been &s;aying &s;omething very dreadful; for I watched you all the time, and, though at a di&s;tance, could perceive your countenance change &s;everal times." Matilda wi&s;hed to keep the la&s;t equivocal words of her brother from Agnes, as &s;he knew &s;he was, if po&s;&s;ible, more timid than her&s;elf; but her looks contradicted her &s;peech, and little u&s;ed to &s;ay untruths, even the que&s;tions of the innocent Agnes puzzled and perplexed her. They returned to Alfred in the hall. He was more melancholy than ever, and Matilda was &s;orry &s;he had &s;poken to him on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time Leonard returned, and produced plenty of wine, with part of a French new&s;paper, which he told them he had by chance laid hold of. One of the paragraphs mentioned the death of count D'Ollifont, and that, by the account of the phy&s;icians, he was murdered by a wound given him at a ma&s;querade by his relation, the chevalier Ma&s;erini, who had fled to France; but that &s;trict
<PB N="159" REF="035833_0160_10093DE62BE15278">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">earch was now making after him, both in that country and Italy.</P>
<P>"At all events, then," &s;aid Alfred, "we mu&s;t re|main here till either ju&s;tice brings my cau&s;e to a proper cri&s;is, or till I am cru&s;hed by arbitrary power and match|le&s;s villainy."</P>
<P>He &s;eemed much affected, yet bore the news with unu|&s;ual fortitude. Leonard reque&s;ted to &s;peak to him a|lone, and they retired to their apartment. Agnes again wondered at the&s;e private conferences, and Matilda was yet &s;ilent,</P>
<P>In about an hour and a half they returned to the par|lour. Leonard &s;till continued gloomy: but there was a con&s;iderable alteration in his ma&s;ter&mdash;he was now as full of &s;pirits as he had been before melancholy; but yet they &s;eemed forced, and it appeared more like a madman's mirth, than the regular &s;en&s;ations of joy. He laughed, talked immoderately, but yet often &s;ighed.</P>
<P>Matilda ob&s;erved him with anxiety and terror; while Agnes and Leonard were &s;ilent &s;pectators of his &s;trange be|haviour. Supper-time at length arrived; when the little group formed an expre&s;&s;ive &s;cene. Alfred at one end of the table, fir&s;t in an exce&s;&s;ive fit of merriment, then looking round him with horror, hardly able to &s;uppre&s;s the ri&s;ing tear. His &s;i&s;ter was &s;eated next him; her colour entirely faded through di&s;tre&s;s, while her fine eyes were fixed on him with a look of mi&s;ery that well &s;howed the inward workings of her &s;oul. Agnes wept, and looked up to Ma|tilda for con&s;olation, who was now unable to give it.</P>
<P>The good old Leonard was &s;eated at a little di&s;tance from them, &s;urveying each with attention, and often wiping from his aged eye the watery drop of &s;ympathetic tender|ne&s;s. "Give us more light," &s;aid Alfred; "we will
<PB N="160" REF="035833_0161_10093DA399DB4B10">
make a jovial night of it; and &s;et on another bottle of the la&s;t wine."</P>
<P>Leonard obeyed; two more candles were lighted, and the bottle placed before him.</P>
<P>"You do not con&s;ider," &s;aid Matilda, "that it grows late, and we have already had the u&s;ual quantity."</P>
<P>"I care not," he an&s;wered: "the Tu&s;can grape revives me."</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter perceived it had already taken great effect on his &s;pirits. The night now began to grow extremely &s;tor|my, and the thunder rolled over the building with con&s;i|derable noi&s;e. The room being very large, the further part from where they &s;at was entirely dark; but even this &s;pace was at intervals illumined by the fla&s;hes of lightning which darted through the windows in that part, the &s;hut|ters being entirely decayed. Matilda and Agnes once more begged him to retire to re&s;t; but he was ob&s;tinate, declar|ed he would not, and ordered another bottle, having drank the chief part of the former one. In &s;hort, he took bumper after bumper for &s;ome time, while every moment he be|came more frantic, and the avidity with which he drank confirmed him to be di&s;tracted. His behaviour al&s;o &s;how|ed him to be intoxicated; and the walls of Gra&s;ville Ab|bey, which had &s;o long remained in &s;ilence, now rung again with his exclamations and noi&s;e. Yet his voice was often drowned by the repeated claps of thunder, while the light|ning became more and more dreadful. Matilda, Agnes, and Leonard, were all &s;ilent &s;pectators of this &s;cene. It was now midnight, and they gave up all idea of per&s;uad|ing him to retire to re&s;t</P>
<P>"Fill your gla&s;&s;es!" he cried "I am going to give you a noble health." He ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and &s;ighed hea|vily,
<PB N="161" REF="035833_0162_10093DEA6D85AFC0">
then holding up the &s;parkling goblet, he exclaimed, "Lady Caroline Albourne!"</P>
<P>A mo&s;t tremendous clap of thunder!</P>
<P>Each looked with horror: Alfred &s;tood in the &s;ame po&s;|ture as when he uttered the health; nor had he been able even to put his lips to the gla&s;s; but, after the noi&s;e entirely died away, &s;eemed to be li&s;tening with a degree of terror, as if he then heard it. In a few minutes he recov|ered him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"This is a dreadful night," &s;aid he to his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>"It is indeed," an&s;wered Matilda. For "heaven's &s;ake, Alfred, let us retire to re&s;t: I a&s;&s;ure you I can hardly &s;up|port my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Another health!" he cried, relap&s;ing into his former manner; "another I mu&s;t drink. Leonard, repleni&s;h the goblet."</P>
<P>"You forget, &s;ir, that it is now full."</P>
<P>"True, true," he cried, "I had forgot. Here then," &s;aid he, laughing, "is to the old gho&s;t that inhabits this Abbey."</P>
<P>A violent cra&s;h!</P>
<P>All &s;tarted from their &s;eats. Agnes &s;hrieked; Matilda looked wild; Leonard ran to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; while Al|fred was &s;till unable to put the goblet to him mouth, but &s;tood half &s;tupefied with wine, horror and a&s;toni&s;hment. The noi&s;e &s;eemed to come from an apartment which open|ed by a pair of folding doors into the dark part of the room where they were now &s;tanding.</P>
<P>Before any one could &s;peak, a violent clap of thunder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ollowed, and &s;everal fla&s;hes of lightning. The fir&s;t per|&s;on who broke &s;ilence was Leonard. "Be not frighten|ed," &s;aid he to Matilda and Agnes: but his tong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e
<PB N="162" REF="035833_0163_10093DA51F675650">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aultered, and &s;howed he was equally terrified with them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>"This is a terrible night," continued Leonard; "but I will protect you to the la&s;t drop of my blood."</P>
<P>"And &s;o will I," cried Alfred, &s;taggering from his &s;eat; "I will protect you too."</P>
<P>"Talk not of protecting us, Alfred," an&s;wered Ma|tilda: for if the &s;pirit of our father at this time walks in the&s;e apartments, it is but to reproach you for your pre&s;ent di&s;graceful &s;ituation.&mdash;Come, Agnes, we will go to bed."</P>
<P>"Oh! no indeed, mademoi&s;elle! I dare not," &s;aid Ag|nes: "I cannot move."</P>
<P>Matilda's reproach &s;eemed to have &s;ome effect on her brother. "My father!" he exclaimed.</P>
<P>A deep groan.</P>
<P>"Hark! hark! he an&s;wers me: it is from that room: I'll &s;ee him, if I die."</P>
<P>"Not for worlds," &s;aid Leonard, holding him. "There may be treachery in this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ir; pray &s;tay where you are."</P>
<P>Another groan!</P>
<P>"Hark again!" he exclaimed, "I will go; by heavens, I will be &s;atisfied." At that moment he di&s;engaged him|&s;elf from Leonard, who, catching up a &s;word, followed him. They both ru&s;hed to the dark part of the room. Al|fred was fir&s;t&punc; he pu&s;hed open the folding doors. An a|mazing fla&s;h of lightning illumined the apartment they entered Alfred, in a tone of horror, exclaimed, "There!"</P>
<P>The object caught Leonard's eye. "In the name of the Holy Virgin," &s;aid the old man, "who art thou?"</P>
<P>"'Tis gone, 'tis vani&s;hed," an&s;wered Alfred. He was right; there was nothing now to be &s;een. They returned
<PB N="163" REF="035833_0164_10093DEBF53984D0">
to the parlour; Matilda and Agnes, who had been entire|ly forgotten by them, were lying on the couch, nearly &s;en&s;ele&s;s; but the former had heard the words that pa&s;&s;ed, di&s;tinctly. Alfred had in a great degree regained his rea|&s;on. Matilda and Agnes after &s;ome little time recovered, and, with a&s;&s;i&s;tance, arrived at their chamber: here they parted for the night; and thus ended an adventure which &s;eemed in a great mea&s;ure to confirm all the terrific reports concerning Gra&s;ville Abbey.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE in the mid&s;t of bu&s;ine&s;s or employment, we often &s;uppo&s;e, on account of many di&s;agreeable circum&s;tan|ces that are apt to impede our pa&s;&s;age through life, that we could with plea&s;ure relinqui&s;h all commerce with mankind, and live after the manner of a mi&s;anthrope, totally &s;eclud|ed from our fellow creatures. However the&s;e ideas may intrude at certain intervals, yet it is improbable they &s;hould continue: when once brought to the trial, we &s;hould, like the inhabitants of Gra&s;ville Abbey, langui&s;h after &s;o|ciety, though our &s;ituation might totally preclude &s;uch a wi&s;h from being gratified.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="035833_0166_10093DF574EBE1D0">
The agitation of Matilda's &s;pirits, and her lo&s;s of re&s;t the few preceding nights, combined to throw her into a profound &s;lumber; and though &s;he was &s;till hara&s;&s;ed with uncomfortable and terrific dreams, yet &s;he enjoyed &s;ome repo&s;e; but the little benefit &s;he received from it was en|tirely de&s;troyed when &s;he awoke in the morning, by a re|collection of the late &s;trange and uncommon circum&s;tances. Her brother's behaviour was as incomprehen&s;ible as the violent cra&s;h and di&s;mal groans which had been heard in the apartment adjoining the parlour. There was al&s;o ano|ther my&s;tery to be explained, that is, what the appearance was which had drawn from Alfred and his &s;ervant tho&s;e exclamations of horror that &s;he had heard. This was a point of curio&s;ity, with re&s;pect to which &s;he in particular wi&s;hed to be &s;atisfied; but at all events &s;he re&s;olved to re|que&s;t no further communication from her brother. Leo|nard, therefore, was the only per&s;on &s;he could que&s;tion on the &s;ubject; and to him &s;he determined to apply at a pro|per opportunity.</P>
<P>At a very late hour they a&s;&s;embled to breakfa&s;t. Alfred, &s;eemed buried in melancholy reflections, but made an apo|logy for his late frantic behaviour.</P>
<P>Matilda looked extremely ill: Agnes &s;eemed by no means recovered from her terror; while Leonard's counte|nance was &s;till &s;orrowful and gloomy. Matilda under|&s;tood, at the latter part of the morning, that Leonard was again going to the public market; but it cau&s;ed no &s;urpri&s;e, as they were in want of provi&s;ion. He accordingly, in a little time, &s;et off for the purpo&s;e of procuring &s;ome.</P>
<P>Alfred, after his departure, retired to his chamber, and took pen, ink, and paper with him. Agnes cooked the dinner, and Matilda took up a book. The former now began to conver&s;e on the events of the night before. "It
<PB N="166" REF="035833_0167_10093DAC822A8CD8">
does not &s;ignify, mademoi&s;elle," continued Agnes, in a harangue of &s;ome length; "but there is &s;omething very unaccountable in this abbey. I am &s;ure I &s;hall now be afraid even to remain in this parlour by my&s;elf. The holy Virgin protect us! but I &s;hould not wonder if we were all to be carried away one of the&s;e days by the hobgoblins that haunt the place."</P>
<P>"Rather one of the&s;e nights," an&s;wered Matilda, willing to put off the di&s;cour&s;e with a je&s;t.</P>
<P>"Indeed, mademoi&s;elle, but father Dun&s;tan u&s;ed to &s;ay &s;uch things have been &s;een, even when the &s;un &s;hined."</P>
<P>Matilda could not help laughing; but Agnes looked more &s;erious, and declared father Dun&s;tan was a man who had often conver&s;ed with them, and knew their tricks as well as they did them&s;elves.</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake, Agnes," replied Matilda, "do not encourage the&s;e &s;illy ideas, or you will make your life a &s;cene of uncomfortable apprehen&s;ion and terror."</P>
<P>"It is a misfortune, mademoi&s;elle; and you mu&s;t pity in&s;tead of blaming me. Yet," continued Agnes, with an arch look, "I rather think you only talk in this indifferent manner to me, with the kind intent of di&s;pelling my fears: I thank you; but you mu&s;t give me leave to &s;ay, I think your thoughts are far different from your words."</P>
<P>This remark was ju&s;t; and Matilda's he&s;itating manner and blu&s;h confirmed Agnes that &s;he was right. After &s;ome time, Alfred returned from his chamber. He &s;poke but little, and &s;eemed to wait with a degree of impatience for Leonard's return. He, however, &s;topped longer than u&s;ual; and they had nearly fini&s;hed their dinner when he entered. He brought with him a good &s;tock of provi&s;ions; but the information he had received was by no means agreeable. The people, he &s;aid, talked much of the death of count
<PB N="167" REF="035833_0168_10093DEEDAB77A40">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'Ollifont, and the large reward that was offered for the chevalier Ma&s;erini, his relation; "and though the general voice is much in favour of you, &s;ir," continued Leonard, "yet we mu&s;t not tru&s;t to that, and forget the temptation the money will excite;" an ob&s;ervation which they all agreed was very ju&s;t. In a &s;hort time he reque&s;ted a private conference with his ma&s;ter: and they returned to the par|lour in about an hour.</P>
<P>Alfred was then more compo&s;ed than he had been for &s;ome time, and Leonard rather more chearful. After &s;up|per the latter informed them that he had heard, among other things concerning the abbey, that an old hermit re|&s;ided in a cave near it, which had been his habitation for a number of years.</P>
<P>"I wonder," &s;aid Alfred, "if it would be po&s;&s;ible to pay him a vi&s;it without being ob&s;erved by any other per|&s;on."</P>
<P>"Nothing more ea&s;y, &s;ir," an&s;wered Leonard. "His cave is at the bottom of the long walk of cypre&s;&s;es, on the we&s;t &s;ide to this building. The &s;ituation is &s;o retired, and withal &s;o near the abbey, that it is never intruded on by any of the vilagers."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould wi&s;h much to &s;ee him," &s;aid Alfred: "he may give me information of con&s;iderable importance."</P>
<P>"It is not at all unlikely, &s;ir; for people &s;ay he knows more about the &s;tory of Gra&s;ville Abbey than any one in this part; though he is always &s;ilent on the &s;ubject."</P>
<P>"To-morrow, then, I will vi&s;it him," an&s;wered Alfred; "fir&s;t as an indifferent per&s;on: but, if I find him a man of piety, and inclined to prove my friend, I will make him acquainted with the whole &s;tate of my affairs."</P>
<P>"But I hope you will fir&s;t," &s;aid Matilda, "be perfectly &s;atisfied he de&s;erves your confidence."</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="035833_0169_10093DAFDE961400">
"That you may depend on; but I can &s;ee no objection to you and Agnes being of the party; and you will then, Matilda, be able to judge of my conduct."</P>
<P>Matilda was plea&s;ed with the propo&s;al, and &s;aid &s;he was certain the air would he of &s;ervice to her. In &s;hort, this &s;cheme &s;eemed to meet with the approbation of all; and the evening was &s;pent with more &s;ociality than they had enjoyed &s;ince the &s;econd night of their re&s;idence in the abbey.</P>
<P>At an early hour they retired to re&s;t; and as Agnes and and Matilda left the parlour, each gave a &s;ide look at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olding doors on the further end, and trembled as they ad|vanced to their chamber.</P>
<P>Matilda re&s;ted better than &s;he had for &s;ome weeks, and ro&s;e with more than common &s;pirits. She contrived to get down &s;tairs before her brother, purpo&s;ely to obtain an op|portunity of &s;peaking to Leonard alone. According to her wi&s;hes, he was in the parlour &s;etting the breakfa&s;t-table, while Agnes was preparing it in the hall. She immedi|ately opened the &s;ubject, and begged him to di&s;clo&s;e to her tho&s;e circum&s;tances which had occa&s;ioned &s;uch my&s;terious behaviour.</P>
<P>Leonard looked chagrined. "Alas! mademoi&s;elle," he an&s;wered, "it is impo&s;&s;ible excu&s;e me; but I cannot &s;a|tisfy you."</P>
<P>Matilda was di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"It cuts me to the heart," continued he, "it does in|deed, mademoi&s;elle, to refu&s;e your reque&s;t: but I am bound by a &s;acred tie."</P>
<P>"I would not have you break it, then&punc;" replied Main da: "yet, though you are much older than I, Leonard, I mu&s;t caution you not to be too precipitate in entering into every &s;cheme my brother propo&s;es to you. He is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;h; no,

<P>"Heaven forbid they &s;hould be deranged," an&s;wered this faithful &s;ervant: "for then I am &s;ure&mdash;" here he &s;topped &s;hort, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Matilda con&s;idered it as cruel to attempt to draw from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im that which he had &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to keep &s;ecrets and turned the di&s;cour&s;e to the circum&s;tance of his ma&s;ter's entering the apartment with him, from whence they heard the groan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&punc; She a&s;ked him to explain what he had &s;een to occa&s;ion cho&s;e exclamations which &s;he had heard uttered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> great emotion. Leonard &s;eemed greatly agitated and &s;urpri&s;ed: he had no idea how me could have heard tho&s;e words, when both &s;he and Agnes were to all appearance &s;en&s;ele&s;s at the time.</P>
<P>Matilda repeated the que&s;tion. He was going to an&s;wer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he&s;itated. She begged him not to keep her in &s;u&s;|pen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. He again began to &s;peak, when Alfred entered the room.</P>
<P>Matilda was vexed and di&s;appointed; Leonard &s;eemed happy at the intru&s;ion&punc; and Alfred looked &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> up &s;o early. He, however, ca&s;t a &s;ignificant look at Leonard, which &s;howed he could partly di&s;cover the pur|port of the conver&s;ation. Agnes brought in the breakfa&s;t, and the di&s;cour&s;e became general. It was re&s;olved they &s;hould walk to the hermit in the fore part of the morning, that they &s;hould tell him they re&s;ided near, and that curi|o&s;ity brought them to his retreat.</P>
<P>Being all equipped for the journey, they &s;et off, walked round the we&s;t &s;ide of the abbey, and from thence proceed|ed through a quantity of thick foliage, to the grove of cy|pre&s;s, which, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, led to the cave. After &s;ome time they came to a &s;pot entire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;urrounded with
<PB N="170" REF="035833_0171_10093DB1655B6A60">
trees; and here they ob&s;erved an opening to a cavity which &s;eemed to be formed out of a mountain that ro&s;e a con&s;ider|able height above it. They &s;tood &s;ome moments con&s;ider|ing whether they &s;hould enter: but curio&s;ity overcame their &s;cruples, and they &s;tepped &s;oftly forward. After hav|ing gone a few yards, they found the pa&s;&s;age wound to the left, and could &s;ee at &s;ome di&s;tance a lamp which gave but a dim light, and &s;eemed to hang down from the roof. Ag|nes and Matilda again &s;topped; but Alfred laughed at their fears, and they continued to walk in &s;ilence. As they came nearer, the pa&s;&s;age widened, and they could ju&s;t per|ceive a table covered with cloth, on which lay a human &s;cull and bones, with a large book and hour-gla&s;s. Ma|tilda trembled, and Agnes involuntarily turned round Alfred, however, by a motion, begged them to be &s;ilent. They li&s;tened, and heard the voice of a per&s;on praying.</P>
<P>Their fears were now in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;pelled; and they walked a little further, when a reverend form caught their eye, in a long gown, which was fa&s;tened round him by a belt: he knelt, with his back to them, before a cruci|fix. Struck with a &s;acred awe, they &s;tood in &s;ilent admira|tion, and li&s;tened to the hermit's prayer.</P>
<P>"Father of mercy," he exclaimed, "hear the petition of thy &s;ervant! clean&s;e him of tho&s;e &s;ins and wickedne&s;&s;es he has been guilty of in the &s;ight of thee, and pour into his brea&s;t that balm of comfort and con&s;olation thou only c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;t give. Strengthen him with thy grace; and, though immured in this rece&s;s, grant him power, O Lord! while on earth, to be of &s;ervice to his fellow-creatures; that by good example and advice he may turn the hearts of the un|righteous to a &s;en&s;e of thy goodne&s;s and mercy."</P>
<P>Here a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of tears, which &s;tarted from his aged eyes, prevented him from proceeding: he turned from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="171" REF="035833_0172_10093DF7022E26B8">
before him, and at that moment, lifting up his head, be|held the intruders on his privacy. He gazed at Alfred, ut|tered a faint groan, and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the ground. A|larmed at the emotion they had cau&s;ed, each ran to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;trove to recover him from &s;o alarming an in&s;en&s;ibility. Their efforts, however, for &s;ome time proved ineffectual; but he at la&s;t &s;howed &s;ome &s;igns of returning life.</P>
<P>"Forgive us, father," &s;aid Alfred: "we come not with an intent to alarm you: the fame of your pious character rai&s;ed in us a de&s;ire to &s;ee &s;o venerable a per&s;on. But be a&s;&s;ured, if we had known the effects our entering in &s;o &s;ud|den a manner would have occa&s;ioned, our wi&s;hes &s;hould have remained ungratified."</P>
<P>The hermit &s;till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ept his eyes fixed with a wild look, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Indeed, father," &s;aid Matilda, "we regret that you have &s;uffered &s;o much on our account."</P>
<P>"Ah! and are you there?" ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">laimed he: "I think I know you both."</P>
<P>Each turned a&s;ide: a thought &s;truck them that the her|mit might have &s;ome knowledge of them; and they were in their turn greatly alarmed. Their fears, however, &s;oon vani&s;hed, when in a more compo&s;ed manner he a&s;ked who they were.</P>
<P>"We live not for di&s;tant," returned Alfred, "and, as I before told you, were tempted, by the reports of your piety and goodne&s;s, to pay you a vi&s;it."</P>
<P>"You are very young," an&s;wered the hermit, "to covet &s;he company of &s;o old a man. I have been extremely ill, and, at pre&s;ent, am but &s;aint: pray all be &s;eated. For|give me, if I do not ob&s;erve the laws of ho&s;pitality, as I
<PB N="172" REF="035833_0173_10093DB3F7B1C060">
am &s;o little u&s;ed to company, and am not quite recovered from my indi&s;po&s;ition."</P>
<P>They refu&s;ed his offer, with thanks for his kindne&s;s, and promi&s;ed to return at the &s;ame hour the next day. "You will not, I &s;uppo&s;e, father," &s;aid Alfred, "have any other vi&s;itors."</P>
<P>"None, my &s;on," replied the hermit: "alas! I &s;eldom &s;ee a &s;oul in this retired &s;pot. The dread of pa&s;&s;ing yon|der abbey totally precludes me from &s;trangers. I am, how|ever glad that there are &s;ome, whom report has not &s;o far intimidated with idle fears."</P>
<P>"Adieu, father!" &s;aid they, as they came forth to the entrance.</P>
<P>"Adieu, my children!" an&s;wered he: "the Holy La|dy guide you!"</P>
<P>Here they parted. Father Peter (for &s;uch was the her|mit's name) returned to his cell, and his vi&s;itors hurried to the abbey as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Their conver&s;ation at dinner was chiefly on their new acquaintance. None could account for the effect which their pre&s;ence had on him, or the particular emotion he &s;howed when by chance he turned his eyes towards Alfred, There was &s;omething my&s;terious in the&s;e circum&s;tances, which made them rather dubious of performing their promi&s;e the next morning. They, however, at la&s;t re&s;olved to ri&s;que, it, and tru&s;t the external appearance of this man, in which were combined benevolence, humanity, and re|ligion. Matilda, al&s;o, particularly noticed in his prayer the mention of the &s;ins and wickedne&s;&s;es he had been guil|ty of. This again rai&s;ed their &s;u&s;picions; but Alfred ob|&s;erved, that to humble our&s;elves before the Supreme Deity, is a duty incumbent on every chri&s;tian; "and," continued he, "&s;uch was, no doubt, the idea of Father Peter."</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="035833_0174_10093DF8882C54B8">
Here the di&s;cour&s;e dropped, and Alfred and Leonard, after dinner, had another private conference.</P>
<P>Matilda declared &s;he found her&s;elf much better for the walk. This evening was again &s;pent with &s;ome degree of comfort, and they retired to their chambers rather at a late hour. Agnes was &s;oon undre&s;&s;ed; but Matilda &s;eated her|&s;elf in the &s;eat of one of the Gothic windows, and viewed, with a mixture of plea&s;ure and awe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he gloomy pro&s;pect before her. The clouds were low and heavy: yet it was moonlight; and the dark &s;hadows of the &s;urrounding trees, which terminated the pro&s;pect, &s;pread over that &s;pace which remained uncovered in the court.</P>
<P>In an angle &s;he could ju&s;t ob&s;erve the mouldering, decayed &s;ide of the we&s;t tower, and the two where ca&s;ements were to be perceived. The wind was high and tempe&s;tuous, and &s;eemed to threaten an approaching &s;torm.</P>
<P>Matilda's &s;pirits were uncommonly low; &s;he wept abun|dantly. "Alas!" thought &s;he, "could I have known the &s;orrows, the &s;ufferings, I was to have experienced, gladly would I have welcomed death, and &s;unk into an early grave, without even a wi&s;h to &s;urvive. But I was then happy, cheri&s;hed by a tender mother, &s;urrounded with friends, beloved by all, and knew not the duplicity of man|kind, or the misfortunes human nature is &s;ubject to. Mer|ciful Father," exclaimed &s;he with fervency, "forgive my murmuring at thy will: &s;trengthen me to &s;upport tho&s;e &s;cenes of adver&s;ity I am de&s;tined to go through; and give me fortitude enough to bear that fate it is ordained I &s;hould experience."</P>
<P>She found her&s;elf more compo&s;ed, yet did not &s;eem in|clined to &s;leep, but continued watching the different chan|ges of the &s;ky. Her eyes wandered over the wild &s;cene of
<PB N="174" REF="035833_0175_10093DB8834DDB10">
foliage, which was in a continual motion by the impul&s;e of the wind. She thought it lightened twice, and was turning from the window, when her eye caught the ca&s;ement in the we&s;t tower, and a &s;trong glare of light at that moment darted from within it. Matilda could not move: &s;he was motionle&s;s with &s;urpri&s;e and horror, but &s;till kept looking at the object, which continued illumined. In about three minutes a hand &s;eemed to wave from one &s;ide. At that moment the light vani&s;hed, and all was again in perfect darkne&s;s. Matilda, &s;carcely able to &s;upport her&s;elf, &s;tag|gered to the bed, &s;unk on it, clo&s;ed her eyes through fear, and, after a con&s;iderable time, fell into a &s;lumber.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>AGNES was a&s;toni&s;hed, when &s;he awoke in the morn|ing, to perceive Matilda was not undre&s;&s;ed, and immedi|ately inquired the cau&s;e: the latter, who had already de|termined on an an&s;wer, told her, that, having &s;at up lon|ger than u&s;ual to fini&s;h a book, &s;he &s;ell a&s;leep for the night. Agnes doubted not her veracity, and cheerfully went to prepare breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Matilda was perplexed to know in what manner to act concerning the light in the we&s;t tower. The &s;trange circum&s;tances which &s;eemed to encompa&s;s this abbey with a mi&s;t of doubtful horror, every day became more un|comfortable and di&s;agreable. It was true, the good &s;en&s;e and in&s;tructions of her mother had brought her up to de|&s;pi&s;e &s;uper&s;tition, and laugh at the folly of tho&s;e who li&s;|tened to uncommon reports. But the occurrences &s;he had lately been witne&s;s to, gave her &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe in &s;upernatural exi&s;tence. The cra&s;h and groans in the apart|ment, &s;he had her&s;elf heard di&s;tinctly, and was certain both her brother and Leonard mu&s;t have &s;een &s;omething more than common, to have uttered &s;uch exclamations of &s;urpri&s;e and horror. Her aunt's manu&s;cript gave a parti|cular account of a light being &s;een in the we&s;t tower, not only by her father and his &s;ervant, but by more than one of the villagers. An interval from that time had now pa&s;|&s;ed,
<PB N="2" REF="035833_0178_10093E4DC217EB50">
of near one and twenty years; yet &s;he had again &s;een a light in the &s;ame building, which had mo&s;t probably never been inhabited even when the late count Ma&s;erini re&s;ided in the abbey. Such &s;trange and my&s;terious events &s;taggered all the fortitude &s;he had derived from the le&s;&s;ons of her parent, and both alarmed and terrified her. She re|&s;olved, however, to keep the knowledge of the light to her|&s;elf for the pre&s;ent, and watch again at the &s;ame hour, when &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly make &s;ome further di&s;covery.</P>
<P>With the&s;e re&s;olutions &s;he de&s;cended to the parlour. Her brother was already up, and the breakfa&s;t waited for her. In about two hours they were ready to walk to the hermit, and left the abbey accordingly. Father Peter re|ceived them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the entrance of his cell, and conducted them to the inner part, where he begged they would be &s;eated. They di&s;cour&s;ed on &s;everal &s;ubjects; Father Peter &s;howed him&s;elf to be a man of great under&s;tanding, and quick ima|gination; the&s;e gifts of nature &s;eemed al&s;o to have been cheri&s;hed by an excellent education. His manners were elegant and poli&s;hed, while his whole deportment com|manded re&s;pect and admiration. There was, however, a &s;ettled gloom which over&s;pread his countenance, that &s;how|ed he had a heavy &s;orrow at heart, which he was unable to overcome. Alfred, at the latter part of their vi&s;it, mentioned the terror which people in general &s;uffered concerning Gra&s;ville Abbey.</P>
<P>"'Tis a misfortune from birth, my &s;on," replied the her|mit, "which is greatly increa&s;ed by the errors of edu|cation."</P>
<P>"Yet &s;urely &s;uch terrors are natural," &s;aid Matilda; "and in every &s;ituation we &s;hould be &s;ubject to their influence."</P>
<P>"True;" an&s;wered Father Peter; "yet they are greatly encouraged by tales of horror, and terrific recitals, which
<PB N="3" REF="035833_0179_10093E02C9AECA50">
curio&s;ity prompts us to li&s;ten to, and which &s;o far win on our fancy, as to make us anxious after &s;uch entertainment."</P>
<P>"Your ob&s;ervations, father, are ju&s;t," &s;aid Alfred; "yet there may, &s;ometimes, circum&s;tances happen to us of a &s;trange nature, that to all human probability would confirm the appearance of &s;upernatural beings."</P>
<P>Here he looked at Leonard, who&s;e countenance changed, while he &s;eemed to &s;hudder at the ideas his ma&s;ter's words had occa&s;ioned. None, except Matilda, ob&s;erved it; but &s;he had lately watched every look of both her brother and Leonard. Father Peter appeared al&s;o di&s;turbed: he he&s;i|tated &s;ome time before he an&s;wered; at length, however, he gave a &s;hort reply, and the conver&s;ation took another turn.</P>
<P>After a little time they took their leave, and again walked to the abbey. Alfred, when dinner was fini&s;hed, had a conference of &s;ome time with Leonard; and the lat|ter immediately after walked out. Matilda, with &s;urpri&s;e, a&s;ked where he was gone; Alfred an&s;wered her with &s;ome confu&s;ion, that he had &s;ent him to try if he could, by any &s;tratagem, find if there were letters directed to him at the po&s;t-hou&s;e. This &s;he knew to be entirely eva&s;ive: but &s;he &s;aid no more; and her brother &s;oon after retired to his chamber.</P>
<P>Agnes, the moment he was gone, began talking, as u&s;ual, of the room that was next to that they were now in, and declared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he expected every in&s;tant &s;ome hobgoblin would &s;tart through the large heavy folding doors before them. Matilda a&s;ked if &s;he knew whether her brother or Leonard had examined the apartment.</P>
<P>"Oh yes, made<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;elle, the other morning before you was up."</P>
<P>"And, pray, did they &s;ee any thing particular?"</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035833_0180_10093E506D407130">
"Nothing then," an&s;wered Agnes: "but they did that dreadful night: for you mu&s;t know, had the curio&s;ity to li&s;ten to their di&s;cour&s;e while they were &s;earching the place; and though they &s;poke very low, I could ju&s;t make out, mademoi&s;elle, they had &s;een a gho&s;t."</P>
<P>"I am determined to have a view of this room," &s;aid Ma|tilda, walking to that end of the parlour.</P>
<P>"Oh! for heaven's &s;ake, mademoi&s;elle, do not enter for the world."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" replied Matilda, and immediately pu&s;hed again&s;t the doors with all her &s;trength, when they imme|diately flew open.</P>
<P>The apartment was &s;pacious, and one of tho&s;e they had examined at their fir&s;t coming to the abbey. The furni|ture was in better order than mo&s;t of the others; but, the &s;hutters being clo&s;ed, the only light came from an opening at the top. She walked entirely round, and could per|ceive no alteration whatever. Agnes &s;tood at the door, and at intervals attempted to peep in, but directly &s;hrunk back, and retired. Matilda, having &s;atisfied her&s;elf, clo&s;ed the doors, while Agnes impatiently inquired if &s;he had &s;een any thing extraordinary. Matilda &s;miled at the earne&s;t|ne&s;s with which &s;he a&s;ked the que&s;tion, and told her &s;he had nothing to fear. Agnes, however, was by no means dive&s;ted of her terrors; and after the &s;trange occurrences that had already happened, and tho&s;e which followed, it is not to be wondered at that they greatly increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>In about two hours, Alfred de&s;cended to the parlour, and &s;hortly after Leonard returned: he brought &s;ome arti|cles with him; but they were carried to the chambers a|bove, and Matilda had no opportunity of knowing what they were. Supper-time arrived; when both Leonard and
<PB N="5" REF="035833_0181_10093E044FF5C8F0">
his ma&s;ter &s;eemed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to have regained their u&s;ual &s;pirits: yet Alfred was impatient to retire to re&s;t; at an early hour they therefore parted for the night. Ma|tilda took up a book: Agnes, after being undre&s;&s;ed, wi&s;hed her good repo&s;e, and was pre&s;ently in a profound &s;leep.</P>
<P>Matilda now &s;eated her&s;elf in the window, impatiently waiting the hour of midnight, yet dreading a repetition of the circum&s;tance &s;he had already &s;een. He brother and Leonard, &s;he could hear, continued in clo&s;e di&s;cour&s;e for &s;ome time; the purport of it, however, it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to make out, as they &s;poke in a low tone of voice. At length the expected time arrived, and &s;he kept watching with a palpitating heart the ca&s;ement in the we&s;t tower.</P>
<P>The night was extremely gloomy; the moon at intervals gave a light; but heavy clouds continued frequently to eclip&s;e it, and thunder rolled at a di&s;tance, while fla&s;hes of &s;trong lightning darted from an illumined part of the hea|vens, which &s;eemed to form a mountain of fire. Matilda kill kept her eye fixed on the tower; but no light appear|ed, except that from above, which fell on its grey decayed walls, overgrown with ivy, and &s;lowly tumbling to the ground through the ravages of time.</P>
<P>She was ju&s;t going to quit her &s;ituation when &s;he thought &s;he perceived &s;omething move in the court below. A few minutes before, &s;he had heard, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, her brother's chamber-door open &s;oftly, and a &s;tep cautiou&s;ly de&s;cend the &s;tair-ca&s;e to the hall. At the time &s;he conceived it to be only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; but her ideas were now different. A &s;trong fla&s;h of lightning gave her an opportunity to di&s;cover a figure walk &s;lowly with a dark lantern acro&s;s the court to|wards the outer gates. It was clo&s;ely wrapped up; but by the height it &s;eemed like Leonard.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="035833_0182_10093E51F4161370">
He now di&s;appeared among &s;ome trees, but &s;he &s;till &s;aw the light through the foliage. Matilda, more and more agitated, remained at the window. In about five minutes, the light again moved towards the abbey; and the moon at that moment &s;uddenly appearing from a heavy cloud, &s;he could plainly perceive two men follow the per&s;on who held the lantern. Both, by their dre&s;s, &s;eemed Italians: but their cloaks were entirely fa&s;tened round them, and their hats flapped over their faces &s;o as to conceal the counte|nance.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch an unexpected &s;ight, and ready to &s;ink with terror, &s;he knew not in what manner to act. Leonard might be a villain! She checked her&s;elf at &s;o uncharitable a &s;uppo&s;ition; yet, why &s;hould he leave his bed at &s;uch an hour, and admit two &s;trangers into the abbey, where her brother had, in all probability, pre&s;erved his life through the &s;ecrecy of his habitation.</P>
<P>This unaccountable adventure had &s;o &s;trange and dreadful an appearance, that &s;he re&s;olved to appri&s;e him of the vi&s;i|tors, as &s;he had every rea&s;on to believe he was a&s;leep when Leonard left the chamber: at the moment, however, &s;he was going to execute this re&s;olution, &s;he heard the latter enter, and &s;oftly acco&s;t Alfred in a low voice, &s;aying, "They are come, &s;ir;" and immediately they both de|&s;cended, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, to the parlour.</P>
<P>The idea of the light in the we&s;t tower now vani&s;hed from her mind, and &s;he was entirely taken up with the occurrence that had ju&s;t pa&s;t.</P>
<P>It was plain to her that Alfred had expecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> men, as he could not be even undre&s;&s;ed by his directly leaving the room when Leonard came up with the information of their arrival: yet what bu&s;ine&s;s he could have with them, was an entire my&s;tery; and the mo&s;t tormenting &s;u&s;picions,
<PB N="7" REF="035833_0183_10093E07A59429B8">
which &s;he blu&s;hed to encourage, at different intervals agita|ted her mind. She re&s;olved, at all events, to watch their departure, which did not happen for nearly an hour and a half; when Leonard, with his lantern, again conducted them acro&s;s the court. Soon after Alfred and him&s;elf entered their chamber, and, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, retired to re&s;t. Matilda, hara&s;&s;ed out and perplexed with the &s;cene &s;he had been witne&s;s to, undre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, and lay down on a &s;leep|le&s;s pillow.</P>
<P>The conduct of her brother was &s;o equivocal and &s;ecret, that &s;he was greatly at a lo&s;s to a&s;&s;ign even one &s;ingle rea|&s;on for his late behaviour, &s;ince that period when Leonard returned from his fir&s;t journey to the market, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him alone. The intelligence he received that day was certainly the cau&s;e of his &s;trange manner of conduct &s;ince, let it be of what nature it would. Though &s;he had laughed at Agnes's fears concerning the apartment next the parlour, yet &s;omething had been &s;een to cau&s;e a|larm and terror: for the countenances both of Leonard and his ma&s;ter, which &s;he even then took notice of, confirmed her they had been greatly &s;hocked.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the we&s;t tower had not appeared again as &s;he expected; and &s;he might have been rather doubtful of being deceived by the lightning, had &s;he not &s;een an arm move within it at the &s;ame time. At length, wearied with reflection, &s;he &s;trove to compo&s;e her&s;elf to re&s;t, and fell into a di&s;turbed &s;lumber.</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;embled to breakfa&s;t at a very late hour the next day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> (except Agnes) by no means refre&s;hed by the little re&s;t they had enjoyed. They deferred vi&s;iting the hermit till the afternoon. Matilda took particular notice of her brother, but could perceive no alteration in his man|ner from the day before.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035833_0184_10093E5485F61F80">
Having walked to Father Peter's cave, he received them at the entrance with his u&s;ual cordiality, and &s;et before them &s;ome fruits for refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>"I had them," &s;aid the old man, "from a pea&s;ant in the village, whom I often vi&s;it, and have known for many years, but never could per&s;uade him to come near my ha|bitation: for being once frightened at pa&s;&s;ing Gra&s;ville Ab|bey, he has never dared to venture near it &s;ince, not even in the day time!"</P>
<P>All laughed at the man's &s;implicity, as they called it, yet were all con&s;cious they were a prey to &s;imilar fears.</P>
<P>"Indeed, father," &s;aid Alfred, "I have heard &s;o much talk of this abbey, that I intend to enter it my&s;elf, and &s;a|tisfy that curio&s;ity which has been rai&s;ed by the different &s;tories I have heard concerning it."</P>
<P>The hermit's countenance changed at Alfred's words; and he in vain &s;trove to conceal that agitation which work|ed in his heart.</P>
<P>"By no means fulfil &s;uch a re&s;olution, my &s;on: the at|tempt may be dangerous. I am an old man, and know more of that abbey than you do. You mu&s;t promi&s;e you will give up all idea of it."</P>
<P>Alfred fixed his eyes on Father Peter; Leonard looked chagrined; Matilda li&s;tened with attention, and Agnes trembled with emotion.</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me," &s;aid Alfred, who was the fir&s;t that broke &s;ilence: "but you forget your&s;elf, father, and in a great degree contradict the u&s;ual tenor of your di&s;cour&s;e&punc;"</P>
<P>The hermit rai&s;ed his eyes, and was offended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the re|mark.</P>
<P>"I did but warn you, &s;ignor," an&s;wered he: "but fol|low your own inclination; do not, however, accu&s;e me of di&s;&s;imulation."</P>
<P>Alfred felt the rebuke, and made an apology.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="035833_0185_10093E0BDA269098">
Soon after, they took their leave, and returned to the abbey.</P>
<P>Father Peter's behaviour appeared now more &s;trange than ever; and Alfred determined not yet to tru&s;t him with the hi&s;tory of his affairs. They took an early &s;upper, and re|tired &s;oon after.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF, at the beginning of life, mankind in general were to be made acquainted with the misfortunes they mu&s;t &s;uffer in a &s;eries of years, the greater number would welcome death, and willingly e&s;cape mi&s;eries they would &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves unable to &s;upport. But when the trials we are &s;ubject to appear one by one, and we, in regular gradation, get the better of each of them, the la&s;t di&s;tre&s;s gives us for|titude to go through the &s;ucceeding one; and by that forti|tude we &s;truggle through the world, and thus arrive at a &s;tate of calm &s;erenity, in the decline of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Matilda had &s;uffered too much for want of re&s;t the two latter nights, to have any idea of again watching the we&s;t tower, or the unknown vi&s;itors to the abbey; &s;he therefore immediately undre&s;&s;ed, and was pre&s;ently in a profound &s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="035833_0186_10093E59F76AD420">
The next morning &s;he was much refre&s;hed, and, entering the parlour, &s;he once more, according to her wi&s;hes, found Leonard alone. She directly opened the &s;ubject of her for|mer di&s;cour&s;e, and now reque&s;ted him to give that account which was &s;o critically interrupted by her brother.</P>
<P>Leonard &s;eemed prepared, and an&s;wered with firmne&s;s, that he hoped &s;he would not be offended, but he could not.</P>
<P>"Cannot, Leonard!" exclaimed Matilda.</P>
<P>"No, mademoi&s;elle, indeed I cannot; my ma&s;ter &s;u&s;pected the que&s;tion when we were la&s;t together, and gave me the mo&s;t po&s;itive orders to be &s;ilent with re&s;pect to every thing relative to that night."</P>
<P>Matilda, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the nice&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, and fine&s;t feelings, yet had a warmth in her temper &s;omething &s;imilar to her brother; and though not quite &s;o quick to imagine an affront, &s;he was equally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in re&s;enting an in&s;ult to her pride. Leonard had hardly ever &s;een her &s;o hurt; he looked di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, yet appeared in every re&s;pect firm and re&s;olved to keep his word. Matilda continued &s;ome moments in a haughty &s;ilence; but at length thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed him:</P>
<P>"The cau&s;e of the &s;lighting behaviour I have received &s;ince our re&s;idence here, I am at a lo&s;s to divine, Leonard; and heaven only knows how I have de&s;erved it. Every que&s;tion I have a&s;ked, though probably of no le&s;s importance to me than to my brother, has been an&s;wered with equivo|cation and re&s;erve; while the &s;trange behaviour of Alfred, and the melancholy continually fixed on your countenance, gives every rea&s;on for &s;u&s;picion and apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>"The&s;e circum&s;tances, added to the &s;everal occurrences that I my&s;elf have lately been witne&s;s to in this de&s;olate abbey, make it to me a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting and unplea&s;ant a|bode.
<PB N="11" REF="035833_0187_10093E0EB7CFEEF0">
In &s;hort, though I have been taught to de&s;pi&s;e &s;u|per&s;tition, yet I have every rea&s;on to believe all is not right in the gloomy chambers of the we&s;t tower; while the words which I plainly heard you repeat on entering yonder room, confirm to me that you &s;aw &s;omething of a dreadful nature: and, continued Matilda in a voice of di&s;plea&s;ure, yet both firm and determined, the&s;e rea&s;ons added toge|ther have made me re&s;olve to quit this place immediately and forever."</P>
<P>Had a th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nderbolt at that moment fallen at Leonard's feet, he could not have &s;tarted with more &s;urpri&s;e and hor|ror.</P>
<P>"Leave the abbey, mademoi&s;elle! leave the abbey! good heavens! you will not &s;urely leave us!"</P>
<P>"Before two more days are pa&s;t, you may depend upon it, Leonard; during which time I &s;hall be able to con&s;ider what method will be the mo&s;t &s;ecret for my departure, on my brother's account; for, unle&s;s I am actually detained a pri&s;oner here, I intend going to France, and becoming a nun in the convent of N*****, where my mother and aunt were both placed in the beginning of life."</P>
<P>"The Holy Lady protect us!" exclaimed Leonard. "Do not encourage the&s;e ideas; they will drive my poor ma&s;ter di&s;tracted."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t impart the intelligence to him, and reque&s;t he will contrive &s;ome method for my conveyance."</P>
<P>Leonard was again going to reply; but Agnes brought in the breakfa&s;t, and Alfred pre&s;ently entered. Directly after breakfa&s;t was over, Leonard reque&s;ted to &s;peak with his ma&s;ter; and Matilda had no doubt concerning the &s;ubject of this conference.</P>
<P>When Agnes and Matilda were alone, the latter men|tioned her re&s;olution of leaving the abbey.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035833_0188_10093E5CAD7C6CA8">
Agnes's &s;urpri&s;e was not le&s;s than Leonard's, but of a very different kind: joy appeared in her countenance, and &s;he declared, of all things in the world, it was what &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed for&mdash;"I can then &s;till attend you, mademoi|&s;elle, and yet leave this dreadful place."</P>
<P>"But will your wi&s;hes lead you to attend me to the place where I intend going?"</P>
<P>"Any where, mademoi&s;elle!" exclaimed Agnes, her eyes beaming with love and gratitude&mdash;"even to the end of the world, with plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>Matilda &s;hed tears; &s;he was greatly affected with the hone&s;t &s;implicity and good heart of this girl.</P>
<P>"But I am going to the convent of N*****, in France, Agnes, and intend po&s;itively to take the veil immediately."</P>
<P>Agnes turned pale.</P>
<P>"To the convent of N*****, mademoi&s;elle! and take the veil! but I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ollow you there too."</P>
<P>Here &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears; for in that ca&s;e all hopes of a union with Oliver, whom &s;he &s;till loved, mu&s;t have ended.</P>
<P>Matilda gue&s;&s;ed her thoughts, and pitied her &s;ituation. She knew not how to proceed: the little money which they had brought over from England, and which, as was before related, was the la&s;t Alfred had to receive of his fortune, being now nearly half expended: and on this account it was that &s;he generou&s;ly determined (&s;hould it be po&s;&s;ible to be done without di&s;covering her brother) to make over to him all that &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of by her mo|ther's death; as &s;he would, after once becoming a member of the holy community, be no more in want of money to &s;upport her. At all events, however, &s;he re&s;olved, if it was not agreeable for Agnes to retire with her to the con|vent, to make her a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent, and, if in her
<PB N="13" REF="035833_0189_10093E1044916348">
power, &s;ee her comfortably &s;ettled. This propo&s;al &s;he ac|quainted her with; but to part with Matilda was nearly as di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the poor girl as to lo&s;e Oliver forever; yet &s;he mu&s;t con&s;ent to one or the other. In vain &s;he &s;trove to per&s;uade Matilda, by every argument &s;he could think of, to give up the idea of going to a convent, and live retired in France: and little did &s;he &s;uppo&s;e, while it was repelled with a &s;teady fortitude, that Matilda had the &s;ame tie as her&s;elf to make a retreat from the world mi&s;erable; yet, with the mo&s;t elevated and noble &s;entiments, &s;he &s;acrificed her own happine&s;s for the &s;ake of a brother.</P>
<P>Agnes &s;till wavered, &s;ighed, and wept, but was unable to come to any re&s;olution.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time Alfred and Leonard entered the parlour: both appeared di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the former reque&s;ted to &s;peak with his &s;i&s;ter alone. They retired to a chamber above. He informed her, Leonard had been telling him of her in|tention to quit the abbey, and retire to the convent of N*****.</P>
<P>Matilda an&s;wered that the information was right, and that &s;uch was po&s;itively her determination.</P>
<P>He entreated her not to take &s;o ra&s;h a &s;tep, but well to con&s;ider a mona&s;tic life, before &s;he entered into it.</P>
<P>That, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had already done; for the many ad|ver&s;ities &s;he had gone through &s;ince her mother's death, had &s;ickened her of the world, and&mdash;</P>
<P>"Hold, Matilda!" exclaimed Alfred: "is there not one per&s;on in this world, which you are &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted with, whom you may think of with a &s;igh of tenderne&s;s, and that &s;igh bring a wi&s;h that you had never been immured within the walls of a convent?"</P>
<P>Matilda felt her&s;elf hurt at the the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035833_0190_10093E5E33F75070">
"Let my ideas or remembrances be whatever they may, my re&s;olution is fixed; nor can my &s;ituation be wor&s;e than that I am now involved in."</P>
<P>"Do you accu&s;e me of unkindne&s;s, Matilda?"</P>
<P>"In &s;ome re&s;pects I do. But this di&s;cour&s;e is ridicu|lous; let us con&s;ider in what manner I &s;hall e&s;cape with|out injuring you."</P>
<P>"Surely you do not actually intend leaving us?"</P>
<P>"After what I have &s;aid, do you &s;uppo&s;e I je&s;t?"</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not, cannot go," he exclaimed, rai&s;ing his voice.</P>
<P>"And pray, &s;ir," an&s;wered Matilda, her pride piqued; "by what right will you detain me?"</P>
<P>He &s;eemed chagrined.</P>
<P>"Indeed, Matilda, you mu&s;t think better of this affair. Give up the idea, and con&s;ider it as romantic."</P>
<P>"Without I am detained by force," an&s;wered Matilda with firmne&s;s, "I am determined to leave this abbey be|fore&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hold," &s;aid Alfred, "and inform me for what rea&s;on you have thus &s;uddenly taken &s;o &s;trange a re&s;olution,"</P>
<P>"For various rea&s;ons, all of which combined together &s;how that it is po&s;itively nece&s;&s;ary for my own happine&s;s.

encouragement to the mo&s;t horrid and di&s;mal &s;uppo&s;itions. The innocent Agnes continually terrifies her&s;elf and me by tho&s;e fears which are certainly cau&s;ed by the mo&s;t powerful rea&s;ons, and which prey the more on my &s;pirits, by my being obliged to &s;upport hers, and to talk lightly of tho&s;e ideas I feel my&s;elf with equal terror. But I will confe&s;s my intention was ha&s;tened by Leonard's refu&s;al to give that information I required relative to your entrance into that room next the parlour on the dreadful night of the &s;torm. When I fir&s;t reque&s;ted the explanation, we were interrupted by you; and he now tells me, that, &s;u&s;pecting the purport of our di&s;cour&s;e, you forbid him to an&s;wer the que&s;tion. Neither would you give any &s;atisfactory reply during our conver&s;ation on the terrace, but left me to think the wor&s;t in a &s;tate of uncertainty. In &s;hort, there is an arbitrary principle reigns through the whole tenor of your conduct, which I am re&s;olved no longer to put up with."</P>
<P>Here her countenance glowed with anger and contempt: &s;he was going to leave the chamber, when Alfred &s;topped her.</P>
<P>"Hear me in &s;ome mea&s;ure vindicate my&s;elf," exclaim|ed he, "though I cannot at pre&s;ent &s;atisfy your curio&s;ity. In the fir&s;t place, you complain of your re&s;idence in this abbey; but con&s;ider for a moment, Matilda, and you will find that it was my exertion in the pre&s;ervation of your honour, and the puni&s;hment I gave the villain who dared to in&s;ult you, that obliged me to fly hither, and ignobly conceal my&s;elf from pur&s;uit, while double infamy was poured upon my name, and by helli&s;h contrivance I was proved a de&s;erter unknown to my&s;elf. You well know, when at Dover, I had re&s;olved to give up my per&s;on to my country, and &s;tand my trial for the crime; but Mr. Mil|verne's

<P>"This I agree to," an&s;wered Matilda; "and to &s;how you that I have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the part you took with re|&s;pect to the count, it is my intention, when once I arrive at the convent, to make over the whol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the little property I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of entirely to you."</P>
<P>"Alas! Matilda," an&s;wered Alfred, "that will be of little &s;ervice; for if &s;ome one does not appear, to make you alter your re&s;olution before the &s;tated time, I &s;hall have far le&s;s occa&s;ion for it than your&s;elf"</P>
<P>He &s;ighed heavily; Matilda looked a&s;toni&s;hed, and left the chamber.</P>

<P>AGNES and Leonard were &s;oon made acquainted with the agreement that had pa&s;&s;ed between the brother and the &s;i&s;ter; and it gave both of them plea&s;ure that the time of Matilda's departure was deferred. Agnes thought &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly, in this interval, bring her&s;elf to follow &s;o bright an example, and renounce the world for ever; and all were rather more cheerful than u&s;ual at dinner. Alfred afterwards propo&s;ed a walk to the hermit; but when they arrived at the cave, the place was de&s;erted; and they therefore &s;uppo&s;ed Father Peter was gone his round among the villagers. Having returned, Alfred read &s;ome poetry aloud, which amu&s;ed them till near &s;upper-time; and, &s;oon after a light repa&s;t, they retired to their re&s;pective chambers.</P>
<P>Matilda determined to watch again for the &s;trangers and the light in the we&s;t tower. She accordingly took up a book, which occa&s;ioned the &s;ame excu&s;e as before to the innocent and un&s;u&s;pecting Agnes, who was &s;oon in a profound &s;leep. The night was &s;erene and beautiful: not a breeze of wind di&s;turbed the &s;urrounding foliage: all was &s;ilent, tranquil, and &s;olitary; while the heavens, covered with &s;tars, and il|lumined by a full moon, gave the eye a more clear view of the dark groves of cypre&s;s, and the heavy ruins of the we&s;t tower.</P>
<P>Matilda watched with a palpitating heart the upper ca&s;e|ment, till near midnight, when a &s;trong glare of light, as before, appeared: but in le&s;s than a minute all was again dark.</P>

In a little time after, &s;he heard Leonard creep &s;oftly out of his room, de&s;cend the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and cro&s;s the court. In about five minutes he returned, accompanied by two other per&s;ons, who&s;e figures &s;he now &s;aw more plainly; and &s;he judged them to be the &s;ame who paid the la&s;t vi&s;it. Alfred joined them in the parlour. They did not remain in the abbey &s;o long as at the former time; but Leonard, as before, conducted them to the outer gates.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as they got into the middle of the court, the light in the we&s;t tower again appeared; and it was immediately noticed by one of the &s;trangers, who &s;eemed to utter an exclamation of &s;upri&s;e. Both his companion and Leonard immediately looked up; and all &s;eemed &s;truck with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment. The ca&s;ement had been illuminated about three minutes, when a figure advanced, and &s;tood in the front of the window. Matilda &s;huddered, and tho&s;e below &s;eemed greatly alarmed.</P>
<P>The form looked to be that of a man; but &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly make out either its dre&s;s or countenance. It con|tinued vi&s;ible but a very &s;hort time, when it appeared to &s;ink down by degrees, till it was entirely lo&s;t; and the light immediately vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>Leonard and the &s;trangers cla&s;ped their hands in &s;ign of wonder; the former attended them to the gates, and then returned to the abbey: but neither he nor Alfred re- entered their chamber till near half an hour after.</P>
<P>Matilda, fatigued, and terrified with what &s;he had &s;een, retired to her bed, but not to &s;leep. Her mind wandered over &s;uch &s;trange events; and the more &s;he thought of them, the more &s;he was perplexed. My&s;tery &s;eemed to follow my&s;tery, and every &s;ucceeding one appeared more horrid than the former.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="035833_0195_10093E19D20812D8">
The gloomy look of her chamber encouraged the mo&s;t di&s;mal ideas; and her eyes, as if by impul&s;e, were con|tinually fixed on the picture before mentioned, and which Matilda was &s;o &s;truck with the fir&s;t night &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the room. Directly oppo&s;ite her bed was placed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pier gla&s;s of uncommon &s;ize, and &s;urrounded by a heavy gilt frame. This piece of furniture had lately been added to the cham|ber, it having before &s;tood in one of the apartments below. A &s;mall lighted taper was near it, and the dim, uncertain light which it gave, &s;howed but faintly the reflection of the objects in the gla&s;s. Matilda, unable to re&s;t, and tired with the continual &s;ight of the painting, turned her eyes towards the gla&s;s; it &s;howed the bed and the rece&s;s on each &s;ide: but the back ground of the reflection was nearly dark. She was perfectly awake, and &s;ighed at tho&s;e ideas &s;he was unable to repre&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;igh was an&s;wered.</P>
<P>She trembled, thought it might be Agnes, but was con|vinced &s;he was mi&s;taken. She heard it again: &s;he thought it certainly could not be fancy.</P>
<P>It was repeated a third time.</P>
<P>At that moment &s;he perceived a light through the gla&s;s, and the &s;ame figure &s;he had before &s;een in the we&s;t tower advance, bearing in the &s;ame manner a lamp.</P>
<P>Matilda &s;aw no more&punc; &s;he &s;creamed, and clo&s;ed her eyes. In about a minute &s;he opened them again; but the appear|ance had vani&s;hed. Agnes, however, awoke, and reque&s;ted to know if &s;he was ill; while her brother knocked at her door, and a&s;ked the &s;ame que&s;tion. She an&s;wered both that &s;he was well, out had been dreaming: and it being a natural &s;uppo&s;ition that this might be the rea&s;on of her terror, no further inquiry was made. Matilda could not be compo&s;ed:
<PB N="20" REF="035833_0196_10093E69E39F6280">
and the more &s;he &s;trove to per&s;uade her&s;elf it was merely the effects of a di&s;turbed brain, the more her own &s;en&s;es con|firmed the contrary. By her fight of the figure in the gla&s;s, it &s;eemed to come forward from the left hand &s;ide of her bed. There was no opening in the room for the admittance of any human being, except by the door of the chamber; and that was bolted on the in&s;ide. She was entirely free from &s;leep, nor had heard the lea&s;t noi&s;e &s;ince &s;he had fir&s;t entered the apartment in the beginning of the night.</P>
<P>She determined to inform her brother of this circum&s;tance, the fir&s;t opportunity on the following morning, as it was of too horrid a nature to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. She again &s;trove to re&s;t, but it was impo&s;&s;ible; and, fearful of even lifting her head above the bed-clothes, &s;he &s;uffered the mo&s;t tormenting and terrific &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Morning at length broke in upon the room, and the &s;un with glowing &s;plendour darted through the thick &s;oliage of the trees, till with maje&s;tic grandeur he ro&s;e above them, and &s;eemed to change the face of nature to life and joy. Matilda hailed the morning with a hymn to that Supreme Deity who cau&s;ed the change, and at who&s;e nod the &s;ame darkne&s;s and horror could in a moment be returned. Agnes &s;oon ro&s;e. She perceived Matilda was unwell, and begged &s;he would not get up to breakfa&s;t: but the latter was cer|tain this would be of no &s;ervice to her, and &s;he accordingly, after &s;ome little time, joined them in the parlour. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> inquired if &s;he was ill; &s;he faintly an&s;wered, "No;" but her manner contradicted the reply. After breakfa&s;t &s;he reque&s;ted to &s;peak with him alone.</P>
<P>Poor Agnes had every day more and more cau&s;e for won|der, and now declared to Leonard &s;he was afraid Mademoi|&s;elle was going <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ame way as he and his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="035833_0197_10093E1C98FA0330">
Matilda and Alfred a&s;cended to the chamber of the for|mer, and &s;he related to him the events of the la&s;t night.</P>
<P>Her recital of them was &s;o clear and perfect, and her man|ner of delivery &s;o &s;teady and free from every appearance of a flighty imagination, that, however improbable the tale might &s;eem, Alfred was &s;taggered at the an&s;wers &s;he gave to the arguments by which he attempted to per&s;uade her to think no more of it, and at la&s;t became a convert to her opinion: nor is it &s;o much to be wondered at that he &s;o readily acquie&s;ced in a belief of the fact, &s;ince he him&s;elf had once been witne&s;s to a light in the we&s;t tower, and &s;een an object which made a great impre&s;&s;ion on him on entering the room next the parlour, and had heard Leo|nard, the night before the pre&s;ent morning, relate that he had (as al&s;o tho&s;e that were with him) &s;een a light and figure in the &s;ame ca&s;ement of the tower.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances, with &s;ome others of a like nature, following each other in due order, were certainly in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> degree &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for his belief of a fact which he otherwi&s;e would have laughed at and di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>After a pau&s;e of &s;ilence for a con&s;iderable time, during which the countenances of both brother and &s;i&s;ter were expre&s;&s;ive of affliction, di&s;tre&s;s, and horror; Alfred declar|ed an intention, which both alarmed and terrified Matilda, but which he &s;eemed ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tinately bent on executing: it was, to watch him&s;elf for one night in the we&s;t tower.</P>
<P>"Leonard," &s;aid he, "&s;hall &s;leep in my room as u&s;ual&punc; but by no means acquaint Agnes with this re&s;olution."</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake, Alfred," an&s;wered Matilda, "do not admit &s;uch a thought: I would &s;ooner &s;uffer any thing than you &s;hould expo&s;e your&s;elf to &s;uch a ri&s;k."</P>
<P>Alfred &s;miled.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="035833_0198_10093E6B69F5CA70">
"Why &s;urely, Matilda," &s;aid he, "we have nothing to fear from &s;upernatural beings."</P>
<P>She &s;till, however, urged and entreated him to think no more of it. But he continued firm to his plan; and it was in vain his &s;i&s;ter u&s;ed every per&s;ua&s;ive argument &s;he could think of, to make him give up &s;uch a dreadful deter|mination.</P>
<P>"Who knows," &s;aid he, "Matilda, but one night may unravel my&s;teries that have been concealed for years? who knows but by the exertion of a little fortitude, by bani&s;h|ing idle fears, and &s;howing &s;ome degree of &s;pirit, we may defy our enemies, my conduct may be made clear to the world, and a &s;eries of happy years be a reward for adver|&s;ities at the beginning of life? what would I not &s;uffer," exclaimed he, "for &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings and happine&s;s! O merci|ful father! if the injured &s;pirit of my &s;ire walks in this de|&s;erted abbey, and &s;eeks the pre&s;ence of his &s;on&punc; &s;hould I not &s;trive for the interview, though it might chill my na|ture at the time?"</P>
<P>"Go!" pronounced a voice, followed by a di&s;mal groan.</P>
<P>Matilda &s;unk into a chair. Alfred held her arm, and trembled.</P>
<P>"In the name of our Holy Virgin," &s;aid he, "an&s;wer me, who and what thou art."</P>
<P>"Go, go, go!" repeated the voice, three times; and then with another groan it &s;eemed to a&s;cend and die away.</P>
<P>"Surely," &s;aid Alfred, "heaven interferes in my behalf, and tells me to proceed! Now, Matilda, you can urge no objection,"</P>
<P>She &s;ighed deeply.</P>
<P>"But you are ill: we had better go down to the parlour immediately."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="035833_0199_10093E22641BD5E0">
"I am indeed," &s;he an&s;wered, "hardly able to &s;tand."</P>
<P>Her brother partly carried her down the &s;tairs, and placed her on a &s;ofa; &s;he directly fell into &s;trong hy&s;teric fits, which la&s;ted a con&s;iderable time; every method was taken for her recovery; and they were greatly alarmed. At length, however, &s;he &s;eemed more compo&s;ed, and, after &s;ome hours, found her&s;elf much better, though extremely weak.</P>
<P>Leonard, who had hitherto been made acquainted with every extraordinary circum&s;tance, was now in his turn a wondering &s;pectator; and Agnes, &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and terrified, declared it would be the happie&s;t moment of her life, when &s;he once found her&s;elf at &s;ome di&s;tance from &s;o di&s;mal and horrid an abode. Alfred mu&s;ed in melancholy &s;ilence on the &s;trange voice he had heard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> nor had he now a &s;ingle doubt of a &s;upernatural being haunting the cham|bers of the abbey. "Surely," though he, "that room, where it is likely my father lo&s;t his life, is the mo&s;t proba|ble place to be vi&s;ited by his di&s;turbed &s;pirit. Yet, may not my &s;en&s;es&punc; be &s;o far overcome by &s;eeing the departed &s;hade of a parent whom I never knew, but who was &s;up|po&s;ed to have been ba&s;ely murdered, as to prevent my utter|ance at the critical moment of its, appearance?"</P>
<P>Matilda was &s;ilent and melancholy: &s;he con&s;idered it would now be ridiculous to &s;trive to prevent Alfred from watching in the we&s;t tower, &s;ince &s;o &s;trange an occurrence had &s;trengthened that re&s;olution which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had before ta|ken; yet fears for his &s;afety hara&s;&s;ed her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">magination, and almo&s;t threw her into a &s;tate of in&s;anity.</P>
<P>Only one method &s;he could think of, that would in any degree alleviate her anxiety; which was, to propo&s;e his having Leonard to attend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but then
<PB N="24" REF="035833_0200_10093E6F18B13A60">
&s;he &s;hrunk with terror from the thought of &s;leeping at &s;uch a di&s;tance from any one but Agnes, and feared again &s;he might &s;ee the figure in her chamber. Her regard, however, for her brother made her re&s;olve to &s;acrifice her own feel|ings, and at lea&s;t make the propo&s;al to him.</P>
<P>After dinner they contrived to &s;end Agnes into the hall for a few minutes; and Leonard was then made acquain|ted with the events of the morning, and with the determi|nation his ma&s;ter had taken of watching him&s;elf that night in the tower.</P>
<P>Leonard turned pale.</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake, &s;ir," &s;aid he, "do not attempt it!"</P>
<P>"But con&s;ider," replied Alfred, "the words which the voice repeated."</P>
<P>Leonard could make no an&s;wer, but turned away with horror and &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"At all events," &s;aid Alfred, "Agnes mu&s;t not know of this affair, nor of my vi&s;it to the de&s;erted chamber. We mu&s;t therefore contrive to make every thing ready without her knowledge, and in &s;uch a manner that I may fir&s;t go into my own room, as if to retire to re&s;t, and after &s;ome little time &s;teal to the we&s;t tower."</P>
<P>Matilda and Leonard &s;huddered at the idea of what might happen there; yet neither, after what had happened, could attempt, at lea&s;t they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">new it would be of no avail to at|tempt, to per&s;uade him to relinqui&s;h his intention. Agnes now entered. Alfred and Leonard immediately a&s;cended to their chamber, and conveyed a table, with &s;ome books, wine, and provi&s;ion, to the apartment before mentioned, where tho&s;e &s;pots of blood were to be &s;een, which, in all human probability, was that of Alfred's father.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="035833_0201_10093E2400E1E808">
Leonard al&s;o laid a wood &s;ire, and made the room as com|fortable as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Having done this, they returned to the parlour, and Ma|tilda &s;oon found an opportunity to reque&s;t he would let Leonard remain with him the whole night; but her brother po&s;itively refu&s;ed it, though he at la&s;t agreed Leonard &s;hould accompany him to the tower, but then return direct|ly. Alfred propo&s;ed a walk to the hermit; but Matilda appeared too ill to undertake it; they therefore po&s;tponed it till the next day. Supper-time at length arrived, and anxiety was marked on the features of all: Alfred was oc|cupied by the thoughts of what he might be witne&s;s to in the &s;hort &s;pace of a few hours; and Matilda, alarmed for his welfare, and terrified at even entering her chamber, dreaded le&s;t the midnight hour &s;hould again &s;how her the phantom. Leonard weighed in his mind the difference of their &s;ituation: when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a tender parent, they knew no unhappine&s;s, except for the misfortunes and &s;or|rows of others, which they were ever ready to pity and a&s;|&s;i&s;t. Agnes was almo&s;t afraid to turn her head, for fear of &s;eeing &s;ome hideous &s;pectre.</P>
<P>All wi&s;hed to delay retiring to re&s;t, and they talked &s;ome time after &s;upper on indifferent &s;ubjects, but with heavy hearts; till at length Alfred aro&s;e. They a&s;cended the great &s;tair-ca&s;e, and parted for the night.</P>

<P>WHEN an opinion is once formed, every &s;ucceeding circum&s;tances &s;eems to confirm what our ideas have before &s;ugge&s;ted; and though of a far different nature, every ob|ject is referred to the &s;ame point of view.</P>
<P>Thus it was with Matilda; &s;he no longer doubted, and a dreadful certainly took place: &s;he did not now he&s;itate whether &s;uch things might be, but &s;he fervently believed &s;uch things were; and con&s;equently every trivial event &s;trengthened this imagination.</P>
<P>Agnes, as u&s;ual, was &s;oon in bed; but Matilda re&s;olved to watch the ca&s;ement of the tower. "My brother," thought &s;he, "will &s;hortly be there; and if will be &s;ome lit|tle comfort to &s;ee the dim light that proceeds from his lamp."</P>
<P>A book was her excu&s;e for not undre&s;&s;ing, and Agnes in about a quarter of an hour was a&s;leep.</P>
<P>Alfred and Leonard remained in their chamber &s;ome time. It was near midnight when Matilda heard them leave it; her heart palpitated for their &s;ituation, and &s;he &s;hrunk with horror from her own. Neither was now near! the &s;hadow of the preceding night pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her
<PB N="27" REF="035833_0203_10093E26BA5C1810">
fancy, and her blood was chilled at the very thought. Thunder rolled over the abbey, and pale fla&s;hes of light|ning darted on the mouldering ruins. Matilda could not yet di&s;cern a light; &s;he conceived they mu&s;t be a con&s;idera|ble time a&s;cending, while her fears and anxiety made her forget that they had fir&s;t to go down the great &s;tairs, and afterwards up tho&s;e of the we&s;t tower.</P>
<P>At length a faint glimmering appeared, which was a kind of &s;ignal to her that they had entered the chamber.</P>
<P>The thunder became more awful, and awoke Agnes.</P>
<P>"Good heavens, mademoi&s;elle, are you up yet? What a dreadful night!"</P>
<P>"It is rather &s;tormy," replied Matilda, &s;triving to be compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Rather &s;tormy, mademoi&s;elle! why the thunder is hor|rid, and the lightning too is extremely bad: you had bet|ter move from the window; it is very dangerous to &s;tand &s;o near it."</P>
<P>Matilda took her advice. The lightning became much wor&s;e; &s;he &s;at down by the &s;ide of the bed, and reque&s;ted Agnes to compo&s;e her&s;elf to re&s;t.</P>
<P>"But are you not going to give up reading for the night?"</P>
<P>"I have ju&s;t fini&s;hed the book," an&s;wered Matilda, "and then &s;hall go to re&s;t."</P>
<P>There being now a little interval in the &s;torm, Agnes was &s;oon in a &s;lumber.</P>
<P>By this time &s;he expected Leonard would have returned to his chamber; but &s;he had not yet heard him enter it. The light &s;till continued in the ca&s;ement; but the &s;torm was &s;o very violent as to prevent her being continually at the window.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="035833_0204_10093E767AB15848">
Near a quarter of an hour elap&s;ed, and &s;he heard nothing of Leonard. Seated on the bed, &s;he dared not turn her&s;elf towards the gla&s;s, but kept her eyes fixed on the ground, terrified at the idea of even looking round the room. At la&s;t a noi&s;e, which &s;eemed to proceed from the court be|low, made her ri&s;e, and go the window. She could &s;ee no one, yet heard a kind of knocking, at the outer gates. Who or what it could be, &s;he was at a lo&s;s to imagine; and, the noi&s;e increa&s;ing, &s;he became more unea&s;y and a&s;toni&s;hed. She was equally unable al&s;o to account for Leonard's &s;tay, and conceived &s;omething very extraordinary mu&s;t have hap|pened.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e now cea&s;ed for &s;ome little time, but afterwards became more clamorous; and at la&s;t, by the &s;ound, the gates &s;eemed to bur&s;t open. A thought &s;truck Matilda, that they might be di&s;covered, and that the officers of ju&s;tice were come for her brother. She trembled at the &s;uppo&s;ition, but &s;till remained at the ca&s;ement.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort period, &s;he perceived four men armed ap|proach the abbey: two of them had lanterns, and the others followed directly after. Matilda was nearly di&s;tracted; &s;he knew not in what manner to act. Leonard might be returned, though &s;he had not heard him. She tapped at the door, but received no an&s;wer. She knocked louder: all was &s;ilent: &s;he entered the chamber, but it was entirely de&s;erted. Having li&s;tened at the top of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and heard them enter the hall, from which they proceeded to the parlour, all fears of &s;upernatural appearances vani&s;hed from her mind, and the pre&s;ervation of Alfred employed every faculty. She determined to de&s;cend, and &s;trive to make out, unperceived, the occa&s;ion of their vi&s;it.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="035833_0205_10093E2CC90E2D20">
But then, if Agnes &s;hould awake, and find no one near, what would be her &s;ituation? Matilda he&s;itated a little, but at la&s;t re&s;olved to run the hazard for the &s;ake of her brother. She therefore took the lamp, and &s;oftly &s;tepped down to the hall, which having cro&s;&s;ed towards the door of the parlour, &s;he &s;topped, and through the crevice could &s;ee that they were all &s;eated round the &s;upper table, which had been left &s;tanding in the &s;ame place, and on which was &s;ome wine: this they were making free with, and &s;eemed in high mirth.</P>
<P>Ready to &s;ink with anxiety, &s;he &s;upported her&s;elf again&s;t a column; and the door not being quite clo&s;ed, &s;he had a view of each of their countenances, at different times, as they turned round to &s;peak to each other. By their dre&s;s and language &s;he found they were Italians.</P>
<P>"Pu&s;h the bottle about!" cried one, who &s;eemed to be a kind of &s;uperior, and who&s;e vi&s;age was, if po&s;&s;ible, fier|cer than tho&s;e of his comrades: "nobody loves good wine better than I do, particularly when it is got cheap.</P>
<P>Here was a loud laugh, and a boi&s;terous chorus of a &s;ong u&s;ed by banditti. At la&s;t &s;ilence was in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored; and one who &s;at on the right &s;ide of him that &s;poke, reminded him not to make too free with the bottle, and forget the bu&s;ine&s;s they came upon.</P>
<P>"True! true! an&s;wered he: "I thank you for your caution, for faith there is great danger of it, as you &s;ay, when we are &s;eated at &s;uch a table as this. But now to bu&s;ine&s;s; come, in the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, we are to contrive in what manner to find him; for my own part I propo&s;e to&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here a loud clap of thunder rolled over the abbey; and &s;he was unable to di&s;tingui&s;h what followed.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time &s;he heard the voice of the third.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="035833_0206_10093E79157AE2D8">
"It is very true," &s;ays he, "that might do well; but I have rea&s;on to think he is in the we&s;t tower to-night, by the light I &s;aw in the ca&s;ement."</P>
<P>"Pi&s;h!" an&s;wered the fir&s;t, "that place is haunted; I have often &s;een a light in it, when not a &s;oul inhabited the abbey."</P>
<P>Matilda trembled violently.</P>
<P>"Ah! that I know very well, &s;ignor: but by what&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here again the thunder interrupted the di&s;tracted li&s;tener, and &s;he lo&s;t the remainder of the &s;entence. At length all was once more &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Well, well," &s;aid the fir&s;t, "if that is the ca&s;e, why we mu&s;t directly make our road to the we&s;t tower: but the devil take me if I know which is the way to it."</P>
<P>"Nor I," exclaimed each of the others, ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>"Never mind," an&s;wered the fir&s;t: "I'll warrant we will find it."</P>
<P>This was enough for Matilda;&mdash;&s;he heard no more, but immediately departed towards the &s;tair-ca&s;e that led to the tower, with an intent to acquaint her brother with the arrival of the unwelcome vi&s;itors. Had &s;he been told, half an hour before, that &s;he could have had the courage to proceed alone at midnight to the we&s;t tower, &s;he would po&s;i|tively have declared it would have been impo&s;&s;ible: but now, though a great degree of terror was left, yet the chief part was obliterated in the idea of pre&s;erving her brother's life.</P>
<P>She hurried acro&s;s the hall, but, in her agitation, mi&s;took the turning to the &s;tairs, and found her&s;elf before the heavy grate-work gates of the chapel. She &s;topped a moment to fetch breath. While her eyes were vacantly fixed on the ruins of this ancient place of wor&s;hip, a faint glimmering &s;eemed to move on one &s;ide of the ai&s;les; and, in about a
<PB N="31" REF="035833_0207_10093E2E7AC113A0">
minute, a figure with a lamp glided along the body of the chapel. This brought Matilda, to a recollection of her &s;ituation; her tottering limbs almo&s;t refu&s;ed to do their office: &s;he partly &s;taggered from the gates, and returned to find the opening to the &s;tair-ca&s;e. This &s;he fortunately found, and began to a&s;cend the narrow &s;tone &s;tairs; while every few minutes &s;he &s;topped, and thought &s;he heard a foot&s;tep behind her; then looked back, but all was quiet, except the thunder, which &s;till continued with equal vio|lence. Matilda, faint and breathle&s;s, at length arrived at the fir&s;t landing. Here &s;he halted, and &s;eated her&s;elf for a moment under a ca&s;ement.</P>
<P>The lightning darted through into the oppo&s;ite apart|ment, which was that which contained the few implements of war, and martial in&s;truments, and &s;howed the gloomy appearance of the room. One fla&s;h, greater than the re&s;t, illumined the whole &s;pace; and, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, a figure &s;talked acro&s;s, and &s;eemed to vani&s;h at the further end. Matilda gave a faint &s;hriek, and hurried up the re|mainder of the &s;tairs; and, when arrived at the top, bur&s;t into the fatal chamber of the we&s;t tower, and there perceiv|ed her brother &s;itting alone at the table, his hand on his &s;word, his eyes fixed on a particular part of the room, with a wild look of horror and agony, while his whole frame &s;hook with convul&s;ive terror.</P>
<P>"Alfred!" exclaimed Matilda, &s;inking on a chair.</P>
<P>He turned his eyes towards her, and &s;tarted.</P>
<P>"Ah! who and what art thou, that appeare&s;t to me in the &s;hape&mdash;"</P>
<P>Matilda fell into a fainting &s;it. When &s;he recovered, &s;he found her brother &s;tanding over her, and admini&s;tering &s;ome wine and water. His haggard countenance met here
<PB N="32" REF="035833_0208_10093E7AEE588468">
when &s;he opened her eyes, and with a look of di&s;traction he a&s;ked her what brought her there.</P>
<P>"Anxiety for your &s;afety," an&s;wered &s;he; and immedi|ately related to him, in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;cene &s;he had been witne&s;s to, concerning the men who were now in the abbey.</P>
<P>"Merciful father!" he exclaimed, "how much longer &s;hall I be hara&s;&s;ed with horror and misfortunes, which follow each other &s;o quickly, that I am not able to extri|cate my&s;elf from one, before it is &s;ucceeded by a greater, which &s;eems at once to overwhelm me with ruin and de&s;|pair? What am I &s;aying?" continued he: "dare I to que&s;tion the Almighty, wretch that I am, and repine at tho&s;e adver&s;ities he has ordained I &s;hould experience?"</P>
<P>"Stand not here," &s;aid Matilda, "but leave this part of the building. They will, I am afraid, begin to a&s;cend the &s;tair-ca&s;e before we can get down. Pray make ha&s;te. If you can but evade them &s;o as to attain the great &s;tair-ca&s;e, you may conceal your&s;elf in &s;ome of the further apartments beyond our chambers, while they are &s;earching here."</P>
<P>They now began to de&s;cend (Alfred having put out the lamp in the chamber) and fortunately found them&s;elves at the bottom, without any interruption, but heard &s;ome voices at the further end of the pa&s;&s;age, next the chapel by the great gates. They &s;topped not to li&s;ten, but immedi|ately ran up the principal &s;tairs. At the top they di&s;cover|ed Leonard.</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake, Leonard," exclaimed both brother and &s;i&s;ter, "where have you been?"</P>
<P>"Faith," returned Leonard, "that I can hardly tell; but, by &s;ome means or other, I turned wrong on the &s;tair|ca&s;e of the we&s;t tower when I left my ma&s;ter to come back to my chamber. It led me into a &s;mall pa&s;&s;age, and I
<PB N="33" REF="035833_0209_100937D798068728">
there found &s;ome &s;tone &s;teps. Thinking that this was on|ly an angle, and that it would lead me to the &s;ame &s;pot as if I had continued right, I de&s;cended them, but &s;oon &s;ound my error, and di&s;covered my&s;elf among the ruins of the chapel. The&s;e I cro&s;&s;ed, to read a &s;tone which was erected to the memory of the late count."</P>
<P>This explained to Matilda the figure which &s;he had &s;een as &s;he was going to her brother; &s;he did not however in|terrupt him; and Leonard told them that he &s;oon found his way to the hall, but had al&s;o heard &s;trange voices of per&s;ons who &s;eemed to be &s;earching the abbey; on which account he had called Agnes, who had greatly alarmed her&s;elf and him when they found Matilda was ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>They were now joined by Agnes, who flew into the arms of her fair friend, who, her imagination had told her, was run away with by the gho&s;ts. The party now began to proceed towards the further chambers, Agnes &s;upported by Leonard, and Matilda by her brother.</P>

<P>WITH &s;olitary and &s;ilent &s;teps they cro&s;&s;ed &s;everal a|partments, till they came to the pa&s;&s;age which was before de&s;cribed, and which led to the gloomy chamber that, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, had formerly contained a corp&s;e lying in &s;tate. Matilda dreaded to enter it; &s;he well remembered the appearance of it, when with her brother &s;he examined tho&s;e rooms.</P>
<P>But there was now no alternative: it ended the &s;uite, and therefore it was the mo&s;t likely one to conceal them.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="035833_0210_10093E7DB0FD5220">
After cro&s;&s;ing the pa&s;&s;age they arrived at the folding doors: Matilda and Alfred were foremo&s;t; the latter pu&s;h|ed again&s;t them, and they flew open. The chamber was illuminated. All &s;tarted back with a&s;toni&s;hment and hor|ror. Agnes faintly &s;creamed; and it was &s;ome minutes before they proceeded. At length, however, they advan|ced, and perceived that the pieces of wax tapers in the black gla&s;&s;es, which they had before ob&s;erved, were now lighted, and &s;erved to &s;how the di&s;mal, terrific &s;cene a|round them. In every other re&s;pect the apartment was exactly the &s;ame, nor could the trace of any foot-&s;tep he di&s;covered. Both were &s;ilent: their own reflections were &s;ufficient. Alfred had witne&s;&s;ed &s;o much in the abbey, that he found it impo&s;&s;ible to turn off the &s;ubject with je&s;t, or even rea&s;oning. Having &s;eated his &s;i&s;ter and Agnes, he &s;tood by them with his arms folded, and his eyes fixed on the floor; Leonard was in the &s;ame po&s;ture, on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>They had not remained in this &s;ituation above ten mi|nutes, when a loud clap of thunder rolled over the building. It was followed by a convul&s;ive &s;hock of nature, which &s;eemed to take effect on the part where they &s;tood; and at that moment the Corinthian capital of a large column, greatly decayed, fell to the ground with a mo&s;t tremendous noi&s;e.</P>
<P>Both Matilda and Agnes were nearly in&s;en&s;ible; Leo|nard was &s;tupefied with horror, and Alfred di&s;tracted. Some moments after, when the latter perceived &s;omething rai&s;ed above the &s;haft of the pillar, his curio&s;ity led him to go near: he did &s;o, and to his &s;urpri&s;e found it was a mar|ble hand, holding a length of &s;ilver chain, at the bottom of which was a gold and bloody key. He called his &s;i&s;ter, Agnes, and Leonard, to look at it, then cla&s;ped hold of it,
<PB N="35" REF="035833_0211_10093E36521ECF28">
and di&s;entangled the chain from the hand. A fla&s;h of lightning, and a clap of thunder, again called their atten|tion; when, turning from the column, the figure and its lamp again &s;tood before them, lifted up its arms in token of plea&s;ure, and vani&s;hed through the floor from their &s;ight.</P>
<P>Agnes &s;creamed and fell into &s;trong hy&s;terics, while Ma|tilda, &s;upported by her brother, &s;ainted away.</P>
<P>It was near an hour before they recovered. The &s;torm had now in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated: and Alfred, thinking he had heard during the latter part of the time a noi&s;e like the clo&s;ing of the abbey gates, de&s;ired Leonard to look fir&s;t from the great &s;tairs, and then proceed down, and &s;earch the lower part of the building.</P>
<P>Leonard having left them, Alfred began to give as much con&s;olation as was in his power to Agnes and his &s;i&s;ter: but his words faultered, as he attempted to u&s;e arguments of comfort, while ideas of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s came too forcibly to admit the bright and cheering ray of hope. Leonard returned with the agreeable intelligence that the unwelcome vi&s;itors had left the abbey. They therefore, after the lights were put out, made their way to their chambers, and retired; yet though their hara&s;&s;ed minds received, in &s;ome degree, the oblivion of &s;leep, it was of that kind which occa&s;ioned tormenting and horrid flights of fancy.</P>
<P>Matilda appeared extremely ill at breakfa&s;t; Alfred pro|duced the key which in &s;o wonderful a manner he had ob|tained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. They were at a lo&s;s to know to what it belonged, when Matilda recollected the cabinet in her chamber; and, according to the &s;ize, it &s;eemed to be de|&s;igned for that lock. They deferred, however, trying it, till another opportunity, as they intended vi&s;iting Father
<PB N="36" REF="035833_0212_10093E82B6FDB688">
Peter before dinner. They were &s;oon equipped for their little journey, and proceeded for the cave.</P>
<P>Father Peter was &s;eated at a table, in a melancholy po&s;|ture. On one &s;ide of him was his crucifix, and before him &s;everal papers, which he put away immediately as they entered.</P>
<P>Having te&s;tified great plea&s;ure at &s;eeing them, the con|ver&s;ation became general, and they found that their &s;up|po&s;ition was right, concerning his being on a vi&s;it to &s;ome pea&s;ants, when they found him ab&s;ent from his habitation.</P>
<P>They had been in the cave about an hour, when Father Peter, while talking with unu&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s, was &s;ud|denly taken ill, and fainted away in Alfred's arms.</P>
<P>Matilda and Agnes admini&s;tered &s;ome cordials which they found near, while Leonard unbuttoned his ve&s;t, in or|der to give him air; when they beheld &s;u&s;pended on his brea&s;t an elegant miniature of a lady, &s;et in gold, and a|dorned with pearls. But how great was Alfred's a&s;toni&s;h|ment, to behold the exact re&s;emblance of lady Caroline Al|bourne! No notice was, however, taken: for all except him were too much engaged to ob&s;erve the likene&s;s.</P>
<P>Father Peter by degrees recovered, and thanked them for their attention. He &s;aid he was &s;ubject to &s;uch &s;its, and expected to pay the debt of nature, at the approach of each of them: "But oh! my God!" he exclaimed, "&s;pare me a little longer, till a mighty work is effected! and then I die in peace."</P>
<P>They now took their leave, and returned to the abbey. Alfred mentioned his ob&s;ervation on the miniature, and it was the cau&s;e of reflections the mo&s;t uncomfortable and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. The &s;ight of a picture which re&s;embled in &s;o &s;triking a manner the countenance of a beloved object, brought to his memory &s;cenes of happine&s;s he had once
<PB N="37" REF="035833_0213_10093E37D8C4BA90">
hoped to have enjoyed, but which were now, to all human probability, for ever bla&s;ted.</P>
<P>The charming lady Caroline he &s;uppo&s;ed to be hundreds of miles di&s;tant: and he con&s;idered it as by no means an improbable &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;he might now be in the arms of another. He informed his &s;i&s;ter and Leonard that he again intended to watch in the we&s;t tower that night; but determinedly refu&s;ed to accept of even Leonard's attend|ance in the chamber, that he might be in readine&s;s to con|duct her and Agnes to the other part of the abbey, &s;hould they again be di&s;turbed by the vi&s;itors of the night before. After dinner, Leonard &s;aid he was going to the public market: but Matilda knew this was the u&s;ual excu&s;e. Al|fred advi&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter to examine the cabinet after Agnes was a&s;leep: this was agreed on, and he delivered her the key.</P>
<P>Leonard returned in about two hours, and had a private conference with his ma&s;ter. Both &s;eemed much plea&s;ed with &s;ome information they had received. Supper-time arrived; and after a &s;hort repa&s;t they retired to their apart|ments.</P>
<P>Alfred, in about half an hour after, took a lamp, &s;oftly left his chamber, and proceeded to that of the we&s;t tower. Agnes was not a&s;leep &s;o &s;oon as u&s;ual: &s;he talked of the horrors they had experienced, and trembled for fear of a repetition of them in her dreams. At length, however, &s;he fell under the influence of the heavy god; and Matil|da with a palpitating heart, applied the gold key to the cabinet, when, after a little difficulty, the folding doors flew open.</P>
<P>It was elegantly adorned with gilt Italian figures, of con|&s;iderable &s;ize, in the habits of former times. The fir&s;t three drawers which Matilda opened, contained coins of gold
<PB N="38" REF="035833_0214_10093E8567E04850">
and &s;ilver to a great amount. The &s;ight of the trea&s;ure though it for a moment elevated her, cau&s;ed, after a little reflection, but a &s;mall degree of plea&s;ure; it was none of their property, nor had they any proof to the right of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing it. The fourth and fifth drawers contained jewels, the mo&s;t beautiful &s;he had ever &s;een, carefully pre&s;erved in gold ca&s;kets. The &s;ixth drawer was full of papers; &s;ome of which were letters that had pa&s;&s;ed between the old count Ma&s;erini and his lady, in their youth, before their marriage; and &s;everal after, when the count was on bu&s;ine&s;s at the court of Spain. In one of the&s;e be mentioned his intention of purcha&s;ing Gra&s;ville Abbey, and in the next his having done it, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the title to that e&s;tate. He concluded with ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es that his &s;on Percival Ma&s;erini ought live to enjoy it after him. There were a few fragments of memorandums, which formed the contents of the &s;ixth drawer.</P>
<P>In the &s;eventh drawer &s;he found four miniature paintings, elegantly mounted with pearls, gold, and jewels of great value. Two of them repre&s;ented a lady and gentleman in the prime of life, whom Matilda &s;uppo&s;ed to be the count and his lady; the other two were children, one of whom re&s;embled her own picture of her father; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s companion was, &s;he had little doubt, intended for his &s;i&s;ter Si&s;era Ma&s;erini. The remaining part of the drawer was filled with ornaments for women in former times.</P>
<P>Matilda now drew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the eighth and la&s;t drawer, when the only articles it contained were a peice of ribband, one end of which &s;howed its remainder had been parted by force; and a &s;mall roll of parchment which was filled with writing, and, though in &s;ome mea&s;ure defaced by time, with &s;ome little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ns it was ea&s;ily to be read.

when &s;he beheld her father's name at the bottom! A &s;ud|den faintne&s;s &s;eized her, and &s;he &s;unk into an arm chair. A flood of tears, however, fortunately, gave relief, and &s;he found her&s;elf able to peru&s;e the manu&s;cript, which contain|ed the following words, and &s;howed plainly the di&s;tracted &s;tate of mind the writer laboured under:</P>

<P>The&s;e were the words of Matilda, as &s;he dropped the manu&s;cript from her hands, and bur&s;t into a flood of tears.

<P>Having wept for a con&s;iderable time, &s;he found her&s;elf in &s;ome degree recovered. But &s;he was entirely at a lo&s;s to know in what manner to act with re&s;pect to the informa|tion &s;he &s;hould give to her brother relative to the manu|&s;cript.
<PB N="42" REF="035833_0218_10093E8B2C8E9DC0">
Matilda well knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s natural warmth of temper would not permit him to u&s;e di&s;cretion in his inquiries of Father Peter; and the &s;trange, my&s;terious behaviour of this man had prevented them from even tru&s;ting him with their &s;ituation. It was true the paper &s;he had found &s;poke well of him; but how ea&s;ily might her poor father have been deceived by artful profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip to hide the lurk|ing villany of his &s;oul, and make his punctuality to the count's orders appear in le&s;s infamous and horrid colours. Now, &s;hould this man be &s;till kept by D'Ollifont as a &s;py upon the abbey, her brother's impetuo&s;ity might cau&s;e him to throw him&s;elf in Father Peter's power, without fir&s;t knowing either his character or inclination to &s;erve them.</P>
<P>Matilda was perfectly convinced the&s;e con&s;iderations were ju&s;t, and wi&s;hed to procure her&s;elf an explanation from the hermit: but to vi&s;it him alone, undi&s;covered, was an expedient &s;he was entirely ignorant how to contrive any means to effect: yet it was actually nece&s;&s;ary Father Peter &s;hould be con&s;ulted, and that immediately.</P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;tudy a thought &s;truck her that &s;he might &s;ee him at night, after her brother, Leonard, and Agnes, had retired to re&s;t; but then &s;he &s;hrunk from the idea of walk|ing to the cave at &s;o late an hour. Second reflection, how|ever, &s;eemed to tell her &s;he had nothing to fear; and that would be the only method &s;he could take to obtain an in|terview without the knowledge of any other per&s;on. At length &s;he came to a determination to try her project the following night; and by the time this re&s;olution was for|med, day-light darted through the ca&s;ement of her cham|ber, and &s;eemed to enliven nature with its cheering rays.</P>
<P>She had not yet heard Alfred enter his room: but when|ever &s;he had looked towards the we&s;t tower, as &s;he had done &s;everal times in the cour&s;e of the night, the light
<PB N="43" REF="035833_0219_10093E42DB59FFB8">
&s;eemed to continue in the &s;ame place. This trifling ob|&s;ervation gave her &s;ome degree of comfort, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed every thing remained quiet.</P>
<P>Some little time after, &s;he heard Alfred open his cham|ber door, and &s;peak to Leonard. Matilda felt con&s;iderable happine&s;s at his &s;afety, and, as &s;he was now perfectly &s;atisfied in that re&s;pect, &s;he de&s;ired Agnes, when &s;he aro&s;e, not to wait breakfa&s;t for her; as, having received but lit|tle re&s;t during the night, &s;he intended now to compo&s;e her|&s;elf to &s;leep.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e at a late hour, and found her brother, Leo|nard, and Agnes, in the parlour. The former was read|ing; and though his countenance was extremely pale, yet &s;he thought &s;he could perceive an inward &s;atisfaction and &s;erenity &s;he had lately been &s;eldom witne&s;s to.</P>
<P>Alfred &s;oon reque&s;ted to &s;peak with her alone, and, with con&s;iderable eagerne&s;s, a&s;ked her if &s;he had found any thing of con&s;equence in the cabinet. Matilda acquainted him with every article, except the manu&s;cript; he &s;eemed in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;appointed, but &s;howed great plea&s;ure at the idea of the money.</P>
<P>Matilda was rather &s;urpri&s;ed. "That money," &s;aid &s;he, "Alfred, we have no right to; nor do I know, in our &s;itua|tion, that it would be of any material &s;ervice, were it our own."</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t at all events make free with it, Matilda; I have the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it does belong to us; and be&s;ides we are now in the greate&s;t want of it."</P>
<P>"How &s;o?" replied his &s;i&s;ter, &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed. "You told me the other day we had enough to &s;upport us for &s;ome time at lea&s;t."</P>
<P>"True," an&s;wered Alfred: "but I have now other u&s;es for wealth; in &s;hort, Matilda, this night had di&s;co|vered

to me circum&s;tances of a mo&s;t wonderful nature; and the horrid my&s;tery of this dreadful abbey is at length unravelled. Perhaps we may remain here a &s;hort time longer: but I hope you will &s;oon &s;ee the&s;e gloomy &s;cenes of adver&s;ity and &s;orrow transformed to days and years of tranquillity, happine&s;s and comfort."</P>
<P>Matilda &s;tood the image of amazement; and for a mo|ment &s;he thought her brother in&s;ane; but the glow of plea|&s;ure which over&s;pread his face confirmed that his words were true; and his features once more appeared the &s;ame, as when in former times &s;he had &s;een him, with his own hands, relieve the &s;hivering, fami&s;hed, beggar, and, his countenance glowing with compa&s;&s;ion and benevolence, watch the poor wretch recover vital warmth and &s;trength from the nouri&s;hment he had admini&s;tered. Matilda catched the heart-felt joy; but on her it took a different effect, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears. Nor was Agnes's joy le&s;s, when &s;he was informed of the good intelligence. She wept with plea&s;ure at the idea of leaving the abbey, and &s;till remaining with her dear young lady.</P>
<P>The good old Leonard too was &s;een to wipe his eyes, and heave a &s;igh of ec&s;tacy, at this unexpected turn of for|tune.</P>
<P>Alfred, however, would give no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to their inquiries concerning what he had &s;een in the we&s;t tower: he only told them that the abbey mu&s;t be &s;till their habitation for a &s;hort period; but the time would pa&s;s a|way with far more comfort than it had hitherto done.</P>
<P>Dinner-time arrived: but the intelligence had cloyed every appetite; and it was removed almo&s;t without being ta&s;ted. Alfred, about half an hour after, left the abbey, and &s;aid he &s;hould return towards evening.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="035833_0221_10093E446376B470">
Matilda had now time to con&s;ider whether, after what &s;he had heard, it would be proper to conceal the manu|&s;cript from her brother; and, though many rea&s;ons promp|ted her to give it to him immediately, yet a little reflection told her that the &s;ame ill con&s;equence &s;he had before con|ceived, might ari&s;e from it. He might not yet be acquain|ted with the &s;ufferings of his father, nor with the know|ledge the hermit had of his di&s;tre&s;s and death. In &s;hort, &s;he re&s;olved to act as &s;he had before determined, and pay Father Peter a vi&s;it at midnight. But &s;he wi&s;hed not to leave Agnes without &s;peaking; an excu&s;e might &s;erve, that &s;he had left &s;ome books in the parlour which &s;he wi&s;hed to look over, and which might take her &s;ome time to procure.</P>
<P>Alfred returned at the time he mentioned, and informed them he did not intend to watch in the tower that night. The evening was &s;pent with &s;ome degree of com|fort, and at an early hour they retired to re&s;t. Agnes was &s;oon a&s;leep, and Matilda read till near midnight. During that time &s;he often looked at the ca&s;ement of the we&s;t tower, but no light nor figure appeared. Having awaked Agnes, &s;he informed her &s;he was going to look for a book &s;he had left in the parlour. Agnes did not by any means like the idea of being left alone in the chamber; but Ma|tilda reminded her that her brother and Leonard were within call, in the next room; but &s;he reque&s;ted her to make no noi&s;e without there was actually a nece&s;&s;ity. She waited a little time, and had the plea&s;ure to find Agnes a&s;leep before &s;he left the apartment.</P>
<P>Matilda took the lamp, and, having &s;oftly de&s;cended the great &s;tairs, proceeded through the hall, and from that to the fir&s;t court, which &s;oon, brought her to the outer one.</P>
<P>She now began to tremble and feel her &s;ituation. To be entirely alone at &s;uch an hour of the night, was an idea
<PB N="46" REF="035833_0222_10093E8F8C71B310">
in many re&s;pects terrific. The pale and half-ob&s;cured moon gave but an imperfect light; and that light was often eclip&s;ed by dark, heavy clouds, which &s;eemed to ri&s;e from the &s;outh, and form a gloomy mountain of dark mi&s;t to|wards the we&s;t; while vivid fla&s;hes of lightning darted from the hoizon, and illumined the gathered clouds on the &s;outh with uncommon &s;trength.</P>
<P>Matilda viewed the awful &s;cene with emotion, and was &s;everal times going to turn back; but &s;he chid her&s;elf for want of fortitude, and attempted to laugh at tho&s;e fears which now almo&s;t prevented her from &s;upporting her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She had, however, arrived nearly half way to the cave, when a &s;ound of human voices &s;truck her ear at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Matilda li&s;tened&mdash;thought it might only be a &s;oft breeze which waved the thick groves of cypre&s;s that &s;urrounded her. But &s;he heard it again, and was convinced &s;he was right: it &s;eemed like a chorus, or the chanting of a fune|ral hymn for the &s;oul of a decea&s;ed per&s;on.</P>
<P>She &s;topped, and leaning again&s;t a broken pede&s;tal which had formerly borne a &s;tatue, li&s;tened with &s;ome degree of plea&s;ure to the &s;olemn dirge. But the voices &s;eemed now to approach much nearer; and &s;he perceived a glare of light at &s;ome di&s;tance above the foliage, which informed her the per&s;ons whom &s;he had heard were near. Terror at being di&s;covered, now overcame every other con&s;ideration, and with eager eye &s;he &s;crutini&s;ed each &s;ide of the grove, to find a place of concealment. At length &s;he fortunately found a &s;mall opening in one part, which, by putting back the boughs, with &s;ome little trouble, admitted and clo&s;ed her from view. She now conceived her&s;elf to be &s;afe from ob&s;ervation, though there was a part through which &s;he could plainly di&s;cover whatever pa&s;&s;ed on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="035833_0223_10093E4A15F765D8">
Five minutes did not elap&s;e before a proce&s;&s;ion of men entered the path, &s;till &s;inging in the &s;ame &s;olemn manner. A prie&s;t of holy orders proceeded fir&s;t; but how greatly was &s;he a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee him followed by about twelve men, who had every appearance of banditti in dre&s;s and figure! The fir&s;t &s;ix carried torches; the other half follow|ed after, with &s;low and melancholy &s;teps. The&s;e were &s;ucceeded by &s;ix more, bearing a coffin on their &s;houlders, which was covered with a black velvet pall, and adorned with trophies.</P>
<P>Matilda could hardly &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf awake; yet by the pale moon every figure &s;eemed perfect, and &s;he thought &s;he could, in the faces of the la&s;t four, di&s;cover the vi&s;itors to the abbey on a former night. The whole company halted at the pede&s;tal, when, to the amazement of Matilda, two of them removed a large &s;tone, which formed the cap, and part of a Corinthian ba&s;e. The pede&s;tal then parted, and was let down, which di&s;covered the entrance to a large vault. The funeral &s;ervice was then read by the prie&s;t, who walked fir&s;t, after which the coffin was carried down by four of the bearers. Another dirge was then &s;ung, and the pede&s;tal was clo&s;ed, the cap, &amp;c. being replaced. The proce&s;&s;ion having turned, proceeded back in the &s;ame man|ner, till &s;he lo&s;t &s;ight of them at the extremity of the grove.</P>
<P>Though elated at the idea of having e&s;caped di&s;covery, &s;he felt con&s;iderable awe at the &s;olemn &s;cene. In &s;hort, the &s;ight of this midnight funeral, added to the &s;trange dre&s;&s;es of the mourners, impre&s;&s;ed on her mind a degree of terror which &s;he was unable to overcome. Having left her &s;ecret place of retirement, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily the &s;trange &s;epulchre, and, with burried and trembling &s;teps, breathle&s;s with agitation, arrived a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the cave of father Peter.

at his midnight devotions. His aged, reverend figure was in the &s;ame po&s;ture as when they fir&s;t di&s;covered him; and his crucifix, books, and hour-gla&s;s, as u&s;ual, &s;tood be|fore him.</P>

<P>MATILDA &s;topped a few moments to collect her&s;elf, before &s;he di&s;covered to the inhabitant of this reclu&s;e cell his midnight vi&s;itor. But while &s;he was contemplating his aged form, bent on the earth, his hands cla&s;ped, and eyes lifted towards heaven with a fervency of devotion &s;he had hardly ever ob&s;erved, ideas &s;truck her that by no means contributed to in&s;pire that fortitude &s;he &s;o much wi&s;hed at this critical hour to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>That very figure which &s;he now &s;o much admired, nay almo&s;t revered and loved, might have been an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in taking away the life of her father!&mdash;and tho&s;e very hands which &s;he &s;aw extended in the pious action of prayer, might have inflicted tortures on her parent!</P>
<P>"Horrid ideas!&mdash;uncharitable con&s;ideration!" exclaimed a voice which &s;eemed to pa&s;s by her in a whi&s;per.</P>
<P>Matilda &s;tarted at the rebuke: but &s;he had not even breathed her thoughts: &s;he was therefore certain it mu&s;t be &s;omething more than mortal. Heaven it&s;elf had chid her for the &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Trembling at the thought, &s;he &s;upported her&s;elf, again&s;t the &s;ide of the cave, and &s;tood an object of di&s;tre&s;s and ter|ror. At length, being in &s;ome degree recovered, &s;he &s;tep|ped forward, and ga&s;ping with anxiety, appeared before the a&s;toni&s;hed hermit. His &s;urpri&s;e may be well conceived;

and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;toni&s;hment, nor by any means free from horror <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;ked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bu&s;ine&s;s at this unu&s;ual hour. Matilda had now partly recovered her &s;cattered &s;en&s;es, and, with a dignity and fortitude of air peculiar to her&s;elf, re|que&s;ted his pardon for di&s;turbing him at his devotions, and then begged him to li&s;ten with attention to a few circum|&s;tances &s;he had to relate.</P>
<P>Father Peter looked at her with a piercing eye. Both being &s;eated, and the hermit having trimmed his lamp, Ma|tilda thus addre&s;&s;ed him:</P>
<P>"Picture to your&s;elf, father, a daughter, who never ex|perienced the embrace of paternal love, but who was yet taught to revere the name of a parent, though her eyes were never ble&s;&s;ed with one glance of rapture on his coun|tenance.</P>
<P>"Brought up with all the tenderne&s;s a fond mother can conceive for her fatherle&s;s children, their unprotected &s;tate &s;till more endearing them to her maternal bo&s;om, &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but little the lo&s;s &s;he had &s;u&s;tained, in the comfort and happine&s;s of this remaining tie of duty and parental affec|tion. Now then," continued Matilda, bur&s;ting into tears, "change this &s;cene of earthly bli&s;s, and ob&s;erve her on the couch of &s;ickne&s;s, cla&s;ping the hand of her child with looks&mdash;Oh! merciful God! &s;uch looks as I cannot de&s;cribe, nor you conceive."</P>
<P>She turned towards her aged auditor: the drops of &s;ym|pathy trickled down his faded cheeks, while he begged her to be compo&s;ed, and continue her narrative.</P>
<P>"Her countenance, rai&s;ed towards heaven, brightened at the very thought of tho&s;e glorious realms; and a chri&s;tian's expectation beamed in her eye; yet when &s;he turned to|wards her daughter, tears would again bur&s;t forth, and &s;he would cla&s;p to her heaving brea&s;t the weeping child, as if
<PB N="50" REF="035833_0226_10093E96CB97F4E0">
afraid to leave her in a world encircled with horrid guilt, and eternal de&s;truction. She doubted not the goodne&s;s of her God; her faith was great, but yet her feelings could not be &s;ubdued. She died; and, if a good life procures a place of grace, wafted by heavenly angels, &s;he reached the bo&s;om of a merciful Redeemer.</P>
<P>"Now, father, behold the clouds of adver&s;ity gathering over the heads of her offspring; the brother petitions a no|ble relation of his mother to receive a &s;i&s;ter to his care, for no pecuniary advantage, but to &s;hield her from in&s;ults to which her age and &s;ex, added to the unprotected &s;tate &s;he was left in, every day &s;ubjected her. The only an&s;wer they obtain is a direct denial from an artful prie&s;t, who by his perfidious arguments had poi&s;oned his patron's mind again&s;t the childrer of a daughter whom he had be|fore for&s;aken when he had no advi&s;e but a bad heart.</P>
<P>"They leave their native country, to accept the invita|tion of a di&s;tant relation in a foreign clime, where an a&s;y|lum was yet hoped to be gained for the female wanderer, while her brother fought again&s;t the enemies of his country. Arrived at the principal city of England, they are plunged into di&s;&s;ipation, &s;urrounded by temptation, and for&s;aken by tho&s;e who &s;hould have protected them again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion. Picture to your&s;elf a villain, a da&s;tardly villain, taking ad|vantage of the neglect &s;hown to the female relation of his friend, and at a moment when he thought him&s;elf free from mole&s;tation employing even force to cru&s;h her to the earth, and bla&s;t her future days with &s;hame and &s;orrow never to be era&s;ed. Her brother, witne&s;s to the &s;ufferings and u&s;age of a &s;i&s;ter, who, he knew, had no other friend to guard her from a wretch unworthy to bear the image of his creator, &s;eizes the villain, who attempts to take his life; but the ra&s;h, though, excu&s;able, injured youth &s;trikes him &s;o the
<PB N="51" REF="035833_0227_10093EDD55E56090">
ground, weltering in his blood, and momentarily, expecting to pay that debt of nature, at the receival of which he had nothing to hope, but much to fear. They fly from the laws of England, return to their native land, &s;hrinking from notice, fearful that the power of their oppre&s;&s;or may overtake them even there. Another heavy misfortune now &s;urrounds them; through the cur&s;ed contrivance of their enemies, the young officer is proved a de&s;erter, by not at|tending to an order which was &s;ent to him the night he left London, and of which con&s;equently he was entirely ignorant. By the death of him whom he had wounded, it is rendered impo&s;&s;ible for him to clear him&s;elf of this &s;tig|ma. Concealed in a de&s;olate habitation, they di&s;cover the murder&mdash;ah! and the murderer, of their father."</P>
<P>Matilda turned towards the hermit. His colour changed, and he gazed at her with &s;ilent awe and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>She continued&mdash;"Yet a witne&s;s mu&s;t be &s;ound to authen|ticate the horrid deed, and give ju&s;tice to the children of the decea&s;ed."</P>
<P>"And is &s;uch a per&s;on living?" a&s;ked father Peter.</P>
<P>"He is," returned Matilda.&mdash;"Were you in his &s;ituation, would you not promote that ju&s;tice which God and nature require? or would you &s;till &s;creen the wretch, and &s;uffer the innocent victims of his cruelty to langui&s;h in di&s;tre&s;s and affliction?"</P>
<P>"Surely you cannot doubt my an&s;wer," &s;aid the hermit. "I would even part with life it&s;elf to procure ju&s;tice for the &s;ufferers you mention."</P>
<P>"There is no need of &s;uch a &s;acrifice," an&s;wered Ma|tilda. "But now, father, I put your virtue to the trial. I come to demand reparation for the murder of a father, and that father the rightful heir of Orlando count Ma&s;e|rini."</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="035833_0228_10093E9854A3E3C8">
Father Peter, though in a great degree a&s;toni&s;hed, was not actually &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed as might have been expected. He a&s;ked an explanation.</P>
<P>"The account is brief. In &s;hort, Percival Ma&s;erini was a pri&s;oner in yonder abbey: yon pitied him, yet were privy to the deed."</P>
<P>Father Peter &s;eemed at a lo&s;s to reply. At length he told her that at an early hour he would wait on her at the abbey.</P>
<P>"You know my re&s;idence then?" &s;aid Matilda.</P>
<P>"Perfectly," an&s;wered he. "Believe me, you &s;hall have no cau&s;e to repent this vi&s;it; and give me leave to foretel that the brighte&s;t &s;cenes of happine&s;s, with the Al|mighty's permi&s;&s;ion, now await you."</P>
<P>"There is comfort in your words, father," an&s;wered Matilda: "heaven &s;end they may prove true! But the clouds of adver&s;ity have &s;o long eclip&s;ed the cheering rays of hope, that I hardly feel my&s;elf able to admit them to my brea&s;t."</P>
<P>Father Peter wi&s;hed to &s;ee Matilda to the abbey-gates: but &s;he po&s;itively refu&s;ed his offer, and parted with him at the entrance of the cave.</P>
<P>The idea of the funeral again entered her imagination; and &s;he felt a kind of dread at pa&s;&s;ing the &s;epulchre, which almo&s;t made her repent that &s;he had refu&s;ed the good old man's attendance.</P>
<P>When &s;he had arrived within a few yards of it, &s;he per|ceived a glare of light which &s;eemed to &s;pread around the part, and &s;oon ob&s;erved &s;everal torches, the &s;ame as &s;he had before &s;een, &s;tuck in the ground: the pede&s;tal was al&s;o parted, and laid on the earth.</P>
<P>Matilda's agitation and &s;urpri&s;e was greater than before; and &s;he &s;topped unable to re&s;olve whether to pa&s;s quickly
<PB N="53" REF="035833_0229_10093EDEDCE57DD0">
by or remain where &s;he was. While in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, &s;he &s;aw two men a&s;cend from the vault, followed by a third who&s;e figure excited in her &s;till greater a&s;toni&s;hment. He was elegantly formed, and his clothes were entirely of the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion, but &s;eemed &s;trangely put on: his hair was di&s;hevelled, and his whole frame &s;eemed greatly di&s;order|ed.</P>
<P>After &s;ome little time they clo&s;ed the pede&s;tal, and, tak|ing up the torches, took that path which immediately led to the abbey.</P>
<P>Matilda was again at a lo&s;s in what manner to act; but followed them, though at a di&s;tance, with flow and cautious &s;teps. At length &s;he traced them to the gates of the abbey. Here they halted; and Matilda, with a palpitating heart, &s;topped al&s;o to ob&s;erve their motions.</P>
<P>They continued in conver&s;ation &s;ome little time, when, to her amazement, they opened the outer gates, and entered.</P>
<P>Matilda, &s;till more alarmed, proceeded on, and ventured to pa&s;s into the fir&s;t court: &s;he here perceived no one; but having entered the hall, &s;he thought &s;he heard voices in the parlour. Nor was her conjecture wrong: for having half a&s;cended the great &s;tairs, &s;he li&s;tened for a moment, and heard a conver&s;ation carried on, though in a very low tone: &s;he however could plainly di&s;cover the &s;peech of Leonard and her brother; her fears therefore of a di&s;covery being at an end, her curio&s;ity did not prompt her to &s;tay any longer, being much fatigued, and in want of re&s;t. She therefore directly proceeded to her chamber, and was happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d Agnes &s;till under the influence of the &s;leepy god.</P>

<P>She enjoyed a calm and &s;erene repo&s;e till a late hour in the morning, and found her&s;elf much refre&s;hed. Having de&s;cended to the parlour, neither Leonard, Agnes, nor her brother, had breakfa&s;ted.</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry" &s;aid &s;he, "to have made you wait: but this morning I have been uncommonly lazy."</P>
<P>"We have not waited for you alone," an&s;wered Alfred cheerfully: "there is another per&s;on our gue&s;t to-day. In &s;hort, you no doubt recollect that, when you mentioned leaving the abbey, I told you a &s;tranger would &s;oon appear, to make you alter your re&s;olution. The time is now arri|ved

that my prophecy is to be fulfilled, and the my&s;terious behaviour I have been guilty of, I hope, in &s;ome mea&s;ure excu&s;ed. Look at tho&s;e folding doors, Matilda: the &s;ight of them has at a former time occa&s;ioned &s;en&s;ations of the utmo&s;t terror: do not, therefore, expect the entrance of a gho&s;t, but a being of fle&s;h and blood.&mdash;Come forth!" cried he.</P>
<P>Matilda expected to &s;ee the venerable figure of father Peter.</P>
<P>The doors ha&s;tily flew open, when, in&s;tead of the aged &s;age, an elegant young man &s;prang forth, and caught her in his arms. Matilda &s;tarted back, and in&s;tantly exclaimed, "Mr. Milverne!</P>
<P>"Not &s;o," &s;aid Alfred: "he does, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, greatly re&s;emble that gentleman; but you now &s;ee before you Archibald lord Milverne."</P>
<P>"Do not believe him, charming mi&s;s Ma&s;erini," an&s;wer|ed the &s;tranger. "I deny the title; let me only be known to you under the plain name of Milverne&mdash;happy appella|tion, under which I fir&s;t became acquainted with the mo&s;t charming of her &s;ex!"</P>
<P>Matilda was above the little arts of female coquetry, practi&s;ed by the &s;ex in general; &s;he did not di&s;courage either his lord&s;hip's hopes or addre&s;&s;es; and, after &s;ome little time &s;pent in mutual inquiries, they &s;eated them&s;elves at the breakfa&s;t-table.</P>
<P>Leonard and Agnes wi&s;hed to have taken their meal af|terwards, out of re&s;pect to lord Milverne; but his noble &s;oul &s;corned the empty title he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and con&s;idered it of no other con&s;equence than a more than u&s;ual call upon him to act through life with honour and integrity, as an example to tho&s;e in a lower &s;phere, who had never recei|ved the advantages of a good education, or the rudiments of virtue from hone&s;t and re&s;pectable parents.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="035833_0232_10093E9C9AAA4B40">
He in&s;i&s;ted that no unu&s;ual ceremony &s;hould be ob&s;erved on his account; and his reque&s;t was complied with. Ma|tilda received the plea&s;ing intelligence that count D'Olli|font was yet living, and that the news they had received of his death was merely of his own contrivance, executed by his creatures in France; and that there was not a doubt but the cruel proceeding of proving Alfred Ma&s;erini a de|&s;erter, was al&s;o effected by &s;chemes of villany from the &s;ame quarter.</P>
<P>Lord Milverne acquainted them that the la&s;t intelligence he received of the count, was, that he had been &s;ome little time at Paris, but that his popularity in that city was greatly decrea&s;ed, on the di&s;covery of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination he was proved to be the author of, and which he mu&s;t certainly have &s;uffered for, had he not been &s;creened by royal power.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall now," continued his lord&s;hip, "acquaint you with my adventures &s;ince you left England, till a certain event happened, which will clo&s;e my narrative, and give room for one to be related by my friend here" (pointing to Alfred) "who will then have an opportunity of clear|ing up his own conduct &s;o as entirely to obliterate every &s;u&s;picion of unkindne&s;s to a &s;i&s;ter who has &s;hown the mo&s;t noble heart and affection for her brother, in her forti|tude and generous behaviour through his misfortune."</P>
<P>Here he bowed to Matilda.</P>
<P>"On the night of the ma&s;querade I had not long forced Mr. Ma&s;erini into the coach, when a crowd of people be|gan to a&s;&s;emble, collected by the repeated cries of murder, from the count's &s;ervants, who kept me in hold. I was immediately delivered into the hands of the watchmen and two con&s;tables, who had by this time arrived, charged with having favoured the e&s;cape of the murderer. I was
<PB N="57" REF="035833_0233_10093EE68D1C9528">
directly taken to a watch-hou&s;e near, but was &s;oon admit|ted to find bail for my appearance, when they were in|formed who I was.</P>
<P>"The next morning I appeared before a magi&s;trate: my per&s;on and name were &s;oon recogni&s;ed by that gentleman, who had been acquainted with my family. To him, and the per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled, I related the whole affair, and made it clear that the &s;econd pi&s;tol was fired fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> defence, as the count fir&s;t di&s;charged his. In &s;hort, D'Ollifont's conduct appeared in the mo&s;t black and infamous colours, and I was honourably di&s;charged. He continued for &s;ome time in a dangerous &s;tate: at times he was in&s;ane; and when tho&s;e fits came on, it was his de&s;ire, in his lucid intervals, that no one &s;hould attend him but his confidential &s;ervant and &s;teward, R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bourn.</P>
<P>"The news of this &s;hameful, ungenerous tran&s;action of the count's was the general talk of the town; and mo&s;t people allowed that puni&s;hment had fallen on the right per&s;on.</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as I had &s;ettled &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence in London, I immediately &s;et off for France, on my way towards Italy; two &s;trong rea&s;ons urging me to take the journey&mdash;one to &s;ee a dying father, who I under&s;tood by letters laboured under a &s;evere indi&s;po&s;ition which increa&s;|ed upon him daily;&mdash;the other, the hopes of finding &s;ome exiled friends, who&s;e &s;ituation I greatly pitied and lamented.</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t news I heard when I arrived at Paris, was the death of my parent, and that Mr. Ma&s;erini was declar|ed a de&s;erter, for not attending to an order left at his lodgings the very night he departed from London. I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to obtain an immediate audience with two of his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters; and though I clearly explained the mi&s;take, was unable to procure any redre&s;s. It was
<PB N="58" REF="035833_0234_10093EA086D26238">
an order (they &s;aid) by the royal command, and could not be re&s;cinded.</P>
<P>"Finding it was in vain to take any more trouble at court, I proceeded directly towards the Alps, and &s;topped at the very hou&s;e where lady Caroline Albourne had been &s;aved from the fire, as I &s;uppo&s;ed by you. I immediately cro&s;&s;ed the mountains, and &s;oon found my&s;elf in this coun|try. I directly proceeded to the re&s;idence of my late fa|ther, which was now inhabited by a friend who had ac|companied him hither, and his dome&s;tics. His will was produced; and I found my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of eight thou&s;and a year, except a few legacies, a genteel annuity &s;ettled on the per&s;on before mentioned, and hand&s;ome pre&s;ents to all his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>"All my affairs being &s;ettled in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, I made every cautious inquiry concerning you; but all pro|ved abortive; and I was &s;till more perplexed, as you men|tioned no particular place you intended to travel to, in an|&s;wer to the letter I &s;ent to Dover, though it was my earne&s;t reque&s;t. This, however, I con&s;idered as the effect of the hurry and di&s;tre&s;s you were then in. An idea at la&s;t &s;truck me, that I had heard &s;ay Gra&s;ville Abbey was the re&s;idence of your ance&s;tors. I had often heard talk of the venerable pile, when in Italy before, and now deter|mined to vi&s;it it, conceiving that you might be there con|cealed. I immediately &s;et out for Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">errat, taking with me only one &s;ervant; and, after two days' journey, we found our&s;elves near this gothic man&s;ion. It grew dark; but I re&s;olved to &s;ee the external part before I &s;tept: we at length entered the thick wood on the left &s;ide of the building. Its lofty towers began to appear above the gloo|my, dark foliage, and the ri&s;ing moon &s;hone in full &s;plen|dour on its grey, decayed walls. I &s;tood &s;till for &s;ome
<PB N="59" REF="035833_0235_10093EEA097F1F30">
time to admire the awful and beautiful &s;cene before me: after which I re&s;olved to have a nearer view of the abbey. My &s;ervant now attempted to di&s;&s;uade me from my re&s;o|lution."</P>
<P>"My lord," &s;aid he, 'we were told at the inn we la&s;t &s;topped at that this wood was infe&s;ted by banditti:&mdash;for heaven's &s;ake do not venture farther.'</P>
<P>"I laughed at the poor fellow's fears, and con&s;idered the report as merely the con&s;equence of no per&s;on daring to go near the abbey. I therefore in&s;i&s;ted on riding for|ward; and we proceeded into the very heart of the wood, when I began to be rather alarmed my&s;elf: for the moon being ob&s;cured by heavy clouds, its intricacies became &s;o great, that I could not find the path we had fir&s;t followed.</P>
<P>"We had not continued in this &s;ituation above a quarter of an hour, when we perceived two men approach, who&s;e appearance gave &s;ome rea&s;ons for apprehen&s;ion. They were armed, and we al&s;o had weapons of defence. At length they acco&s;ted us; and by the manner of their ad|dre&s;s, we found they were robbers. Having a&s;ked a few frivolous que&s;tions, they began to u&s;e rough language, and told us we mu&s;t go no further, for that we were their pri|&s;oners. But our number being equal, I re&s;olved not tamely to &s;ubmit; and giving my man the hint, he engaged with one, while I undertook the other. Each of the party fired a pi&s;tol, but not one fell; when one of the men whi&s;tled aloud, and in le&s;s than three minutes we were &s;urrounded by a party of the banditti. Having di&s;armed us, and taken all our money, they led us in a kind of triumph &s;till further into the wood, till we arrived at the opening of a large cave.</P>
<P>"The robbers having knocked at a heavy door almo&s;t concealed by trees, it was opened by a youth, &s;eemingly
<PB N="60" REF="035833_0236_10093EA555F7AC28">
not above fourteen, who conducted us, by the light of a lamp, down a &s;teep de&s;cent, which gradually became wider, and terminated in a large &s;pace partitioned into &s;everal a|partments. In one of the large&s;t a cloth was &s;pread for &s;upper, and an elderly man &s;tood cooking of it in another room. 'Jo&s;celin,' &s;aid the leader of the party, '&s;ecure the&s;e pri&s;oners; but mind that they are u&s;ed well, and give them a hot &s;upper.' 'Signor,' continued he, turn|ing to me, 'your &s;ituation is not &s;o bad as you may &s;uppo&s;e: if you are not refractory, we &s;hall be moderate.' Jo&s;celin conducted us to the further part of the cave, and placed us in a &s;mall but clean chamber, in which was a good bed. Felix, my &s;ervant, now began to rub his hands with plea&s;ure, and &s;trove to communicate that comfort to me which he derived from the idea of having a good lodging and &s;upper, in&s;tead of a &s;peedy death. But my di&s;tre&s;s was not &s;o ea&s;ily to be alleviated. I was now confined, I knew not for how long, from the &s;ight of all I held mo&s;t dear;" (His lord&s;hip here looked mo&s;t tenderly at Matilda) "and I con&s;idered that death it&s;elf would have been more wel|come than &s;uch an untimely delay. I could, however, blame nothing but my own ra&s;hne&s;s, and con&s;equently en|deavoured to &s;upport my mi&s;chance with as much philo|&s;ophy as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"Supper was brought us, and, although I had no appe|tite, I ta&s;ted of it: But Felix took care to make up for my deficiency in point of eating.</P>
<P>"I had but little &s;leep that night, and ro&s;e in the morn|ing very unwell. Breakfa&s;t was brought us early; and while I was expecting what would be the i&s;&s;ue of this &s;trange treatment from men who&s;e behaviour I expected to find quite different, our attendant, after a few hems, thus addre&s;&s;ed us.</P>

"As you are two per&s;ons who&s;e courage and manners I much admire, I &s;hall entirely deviate from the regular rules of our &s;ociety, and even put my&s;elf in your power, by ac|quainting you with circum&s;tances, which were it known I related, death mu&s;t be my reward.'</P>
<P>"Having thanked him as well as my &s;urpri&s;e would let me, he continued:</P>
<P>"One moon has nearly pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince we lo&s;t two brothers of our order, which accordingly now wants that number to make it complete. It is our u&s;ual cu&s;tom, after &s;uch e|vents, to &s;eize on the fir&s;t travellers who fall in our way; and that lot has happened to you; and you are in con&s;e|quence now treated in our cu&s;tomary manner, which I am &s;ure you have no rea&s;on to complain of. An offer is always made to the per&s;ons thus taken, to accept the vacant places of our &s;ociety, and live with us after the u&s;ual method of the brotherhood. You will both of you &s;hortly receive &s;uch propo&s;als: and though no compul&s;ion may appear in them, yet, mark me, certain death is the con&s;equence of a refu&s;al. We never chu&s;e to enter any one actually again&s;t his will, as treachery may be the re&s;ult of &s;uch a choice. If it is therefore found that your inclinations are not agreeable to our wi&s;hes, you are both certain to fall victims. Do not di&s;cover the information I have given you of our proceed|ings, as in that ca&s;e I mu&s;t, as I before told you, become a &s;acrifice to my good-will to you. Be cautious, therefore; maturely deliberate on your &s;ituation; profit by the intelli|gence I have communicated; nor idly throw away your lives, when you have it in your power to pre&s;erve them.'</P>
<P>"Picture to your&s;elves my &s;ituation, after having heard the information of the friendly robber; forced, as I may &s;ay, either to follow a life of depredation and villany, or fall a &s;acrifice to a &s;et of wretches, who, I had now every

rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, were de&s;titute of even the common feel|ings of humanity. I had hardly time for this reflection, before the captain of the banditti entered, and pre&s;ented me with the propo&s;als, the contents of which I knew too well; and, having de&s;ired me to peru&s;e them, left us alone, yet not without mentioning that he &s;hould call again in the evening to receive our an&s;wers to the offers which we &s;hould find &s;et before us.</P>
<P>"I was unable to read the dete&s;ted paper; but after &s;ome little time Felix rehear&s;ed it aloud, and I li&s;tened with attention. It declared that we &s;hould &s;hare equally in the profits ari&s;ing from adventures, though every one mu&s;t take his &s;hare in the danger, and pay implicit obedi|ence to the captain or leader of the company.</P>
<P>"Never," I exclaimed, "will I &s;ubmit to the infamous mea&s;ures of this &s;hameful crew; in&s;tantaneous death is far preferable to the langui&s;hing life of mi&s;ery I mu&s;t here endure, fru&s;trated in all tho&s;e &s;chemes of happine&s;s I had planned to enjoy within a few weeks.'</P>
<P>"Alas! &s;ir,' an&s;wered Felix, 'I have always been taught, that di&s;appointments are for our good: and if we really con&s;ider them as the acts of a Supreme Being, how can they be bad? Why &s;hould we then throw away our lives, and yield them up to men whom we de&s;pi&s;e, when we may per|haps, by retaining them, recover our liberties, with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e ble&s;&s;ings we before had in contemplation?'</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the argument of the poor humble Felix brought a blu&s;h into the face of his ma&s;ter. 'That man,' thought I, 'without the advantages of a refined or liberal education, can give in&s;truction to me, who have had every advantage in point of learning; as well as an example, to teach me fortitude, philo&s;ophy, and re&s;ignation to the divine will.' His words made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on
<PB N="63" REF="035833_0239_10093EEE21DBA210">
my di&s;ordered imagination, that I re&s;olved at once to &s;ub|mit to the terms of the banditti, in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould give them no room to doubt of my attachment to their cau&s;e; as in this ca&s;e more opportunities might offer, to relea&s;e us from &s;o horrid a confinement. The captain at night again vi&s;ited us: and both Felix and my&s;elf te&s;ti|fied the greate&s;t happine&s;s to accept of the offer; and the better to give rea&s;ons for our readine&s;s to comply, we gave him to under&s;tand we were men of de&s;perate character, who knew no way of living, but by the aid of the riches of others: 'and for tho&s;e purpo&s;es,' &s;aid I, 'we take it by turns to act as &s;ervant, and through this means have accom|pli&s;hed many &s;chemes productive of profit, which at &s;ome other time I will relate to you.' Garbardo (for that was the leader's name) &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with our willing|ne&s;s, and the account we gave him of our characters; in &s;hort, he determined that we &s;hould be entered into the order that very evening. Accordingly, the whole party were called to a&s;&s;emble; and, after undergoing the u&s;ual forms, we received the dre&s;s and arms of the two decea&s;ed robbers; we were then congratulated, under the feigned names we had given them, as brothers of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>"We &s;oon found the good effects of conforming to their will with a &s;eeming degree of plea&s;ure; for they &s;o far re|laxed from their u&s;ual methods, as to permit us to &s;leep to|gether. One rule, however, they &s;trictly adhered to; for we were not &s;uffered to go out of the cave together up|on any occa&s;ion, and were given to under&s;tand that he who remained behind was a kind of ho&s;tage for the other.</P>
<P>"It was a general cu&s;tom for three to go together to purcha&s;e provi&s;ion, which was procured from a man who kept a kind of &s;hop on the &s;kirts of the wood. He was well acquainted with the gang, and proved grateful for their
<PB N="64" REF="035833_0240_10093EA9AE845B10">
cu&s;tom, by providing them with the be&s;t food, and keep|ing their &s;ituation an entire &s;ecret. The place was hardly ever intruded upon by any but the banditti: &s;o retired was the &s;pot where it &s;tood.</P>
<P>"It came to Felix's turn to go fir&s;t to the victualling booth; nothing, however, offered, to improve the liberty of leaving the cave; and he was accompanied by two &s;taunch friends to the &s;ociety. Nor did my journey prove more &s;ucce&s;sful; and I returned in &s;ome mea&s;ure in de&s;pair of ever finding means to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>"Felix was again my comforter, and in&s;pired me with hopes that at another time we might meet with more for|tunate circum&s;tances, which might enable us to obtain a relea&s;e from the&s;e heavy chains of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>"The next day when Felix walked to the wood, he returned with a plea&s;ure in his countenance, which, I could plainly perceive, &s;howed he had met with &s;ome plea&s;ant adventure; nor was my conjecture wrong: for when I eagerly inquired of him, the fir&s;t opportunity, if he had any good news, he informed me, to my great &s;atisfac|tion, it was no other than that he had &s;een Leonard at the place where he had been. 'Nor did either of us,' continued Felix, 'fooli&s;hly di&s;cover our joy at meeting one another, as you might have &s;uppo&s;ed; but he, &s;eeing in what com|pany I was, acted with the greate&s;t caution. I, however, found means to whi&s;per to him, un&s;een, that on &s;uch a day he would &s;ee you at the &s;ame place.' This relation, though for the moment it in&s;pired me with a kind of joy, yet was but a poor preface to any ideas of liberty. I determined, however, to make the mo&s;t of it; and accord|ingly, during the interval of time, I wrote, in a letter, a detail of the circum&s;tances that had involved me in a &s;ituation of which I gave the de&s;cription. This I &s;ealed
<PB N="65" REF="035833_0241_10093EF239A13C20">
up, and put in my pocket, ready to &s;lip into Leonard's hand, when I &s;aw him.</P>
<P>"I vi&s;ited, as u&s;ual, the place, attended by two men, and, in one corner of the &s;hop, &s;aw Leonard, as I expected. I found means to convey the paper unperceived into his hand, and thus returned with &s;ome degree of comfort to the cave.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t now," continued his lord&s;hip, "give up my narrative, and re&s;ign, as I before informed you, the ta&s;k to Mr. Ma&s;erini."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>TO lord Milverne's concluding words Alfred replied&mdash;"I own, my lord, I feel con&s;iderable plea&s;ure in undertaking the ta&s;k you have impo&s;ed on me, as I &s;hall now have an opportunity of explaining to Matilda my rea&s;ons for that my&s;terious behaviour which carried in it a &s;trong re&s;em|blance to unkindne&s;s, though I had her intere&s;t and hap|pine&s;s in view.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall therefore begin from the fir&s;t appearance of that gloom and unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;eemed almo&s;t to cru&s;h every plea&s;ing quality, and give a kind of moro&s;e turn to my tem|per and manners, doubtle&s;s di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>"It was, I believe, the &s;econd day after our arrival at the abbey, that Leonard was di&s;patched to procure provi&s;ion from the public market, and &s;et off accordingly. At his return, you, no doubt, recollect, he de&s;ired to &s;peak with me alone. The &s;ubject he had to communicate, was, his having &s;een Felix at the place where he had &s;topped which
<PB N="66" REF="035833_0242_10093EAC54C63108">
was (as he de&s;cribed it) extremely retired, and con&s;equent|ly &s;uited well his purpo&s;e on that account. He gave a de|&s;cription of the per&s;ons who were with him, and of the dre&s;&s;es they wore, which confirmed them in my opinion to be banditti.</P>
<P>"What to make of this adventure, I knew not, and was &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed when Leonard informed me Felix had whi&s;pered in his ear, that, if he attended at the place the next day but one, he would &s;ee his ma&s;ter there. This in|telligence, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, cau&s;ed in me the greate&s;t alarm for the fate of Mr. Milverne. By the accounts I had heard before of the banditti in the&s;e parts, I conjectured he was confined by them, as he really was. To the uncom|fortable &s;en&s;ation which this information gave me before, the next moment was added another cau&s;e of horror, amaze|ment, and, I may &s;ay, di&s;tre&s;s. The ca&s;ement in my cham|ber above &s;tands oppo&s;ite my bed; as I lay upon it, I could plainly perceive part of the we&s;t lower, nor had I retired above an hour, before I ob&s;erved a &s;trong light in one of the windows; and awaking Leonard, he plainly &s;aw it as well as my&s;elf. I determined, however to mention no|thing of this circum&s;tance, or that relative to Mr. Mil|verne; and he had my orders accordingly.</P>
<P>"Can you, Matilda, blame me for this &s;ecre&s;y? I well knew the &s;ituation of your heart, and was certain the infor|mation of either of the&s;e circum&s;tances mu&s;t have con&s;i|derably heightened that anxiety and mi&s;ery which you then laboured under. This may account for my melancholy the next day. The unea&s;ine&s;s you no doubt ob&s;erved, when you propo&s;ed being of the party to &s;earch the rooms in the we&s;t tower, and al&s;o on our conference together afterwards, when we con&s;ulted how we &s;hould act concerning Mr. Milverne, We al&s;o, after having retired to our chamber,
<PB N="67" REF="035833_0243_10093EF5C6A5CC28">
&s;pent the be&s;t part of the night in conver&s;ation on that, and the light we had &s;een."</P>
<P>Matilda well recollected that night, which was the &s;ame when &s;he li&s;tened at her brother's chamber door, and was &s;o alarmed at the incoherent &s;entences &s;he heard. She forbore, however, to interrupt her brother.</P>
<P>"We al&s;o watched again for the light, and &s;aw it; when, who can expre&s;s our a&s;toni&s;hment at plainly perceiving a figure pa&s;s backwards and forwards, which at la&s;t &s;eemed to vani&s;h with it?</P>
<P>"Leonard, according to the appointment he had received from Felix, &s;et off again for the market, as we informed you, to procure wine, the bottles we had before being bro|ken while he was gone. You que&s;tioned me on the &s;trange alteration in my &s;pirits and behaviour, and wi&s;hed much to be acquainted with the cau&s;e of the change; which infor|mation I refu&s;ed, though I told you I had rea&s;ons for the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"Leonard returned, and (as you no doubt well recol|lect) with the news of count D'Ollifont's death, and the &s;earch that was making after me, both in France and Italy. Leonard then a&s;ked to &s;peak with me alone; he informed me he had really &s;een Mr. Milverne and two other per&s;ons, all dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as the former ones, and that Mr. Milverne, had &s;lipped a letter into his hand unperceived. This he gave to me, and I eagerly opened and read it. All my fears for Mr. Milverne were reali&s;ed; and I four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his &s;ituation, by his own de&s;cription, to be ju&s;t what I expected. In &s;hort, this intelligence, ad|ded to what I had &s;een the night before&mdash;the idea of the count's death, and my own &s;ituation&mdash;drove me almo&s;t to di&s;traction, as my behaviour plainly &s;howed. I drank freely at &s;upper; and you mu&s;t remember my frantic expre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="68" REF="035833_0244_10093EB026275198">
occa&s;ioned by the fumes of wine, and a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ima|gination.</P>
<P>"We heard a groan from tho&s;e folding doors: I imme|diately ran to them: Leonard was unable to hold me back, but followed me. I pu&s;hed them open, and &s;aw, by the means of a fla&s;h of lightning, a figure, of a deadly pale, &s;tand in the centre of the apartment. The &s;ight of it was but momentary; for all again being dark, except from the lights in this room, it &s;eemed to vani&s;h at the further end. Leonard, who was clo&s;e to me, likewi&s;e &s;aw the &s;ame; and it was this which occa&s;ioned tho&s;e exclamations of horror, which we thought your in&s;en&s;ibility had prevented you from hearing.</P>
<P>"I found my&s;elf, however, greatly mi&s;taken, when Leonard informed me, the next day but one, that you had que&s;tioned him on the &s;ubject. I now told him, if you made any further inquiries, to &s;ay that I had given him po&s;itive orders to be &s;ilent on the topic. Lord Milverne had mentioned in his letter, that, through a fortunate and unfore&s;een cirum&s;tance, Felix would be again at the &s;ame place the next day: he al&s;o hinted he had faint hopes of gaining over two of the banditti to his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>"Accordingly the following day, in the afternoon, the time appointed, Leonard &s;et off, and found Felix, as he expected, with two others. They exchanged notes with|out being perceived; but Leonard could ob&s;erve the ma&s;|ter of the &s;hop, and the two men, by their looks, &s;eemed to wonder at &s;eeing him ju&s;t at the time of their arrival. I had ordered him to read the letter before he returned to the abbey, that if it was nece&s;&s;ary to procure any articles more than we had got, he might purcha&s;e them, and bring them with him: he did &s;o, and they were carried uno|pened to my chamber. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find a dark lan|tern,
<PB N="69" REF="035833_0245_10093EF74EFB7300">
&s;ome wine, and eatables. The letter, however, which he gave me, &s;oon explained this: his lord&s;hip informed me in it, that he had brought over two of the men entirely to his wi&s;hes, who had led that way of life but a &s;hort time, and who entered into it as the only means to avoid &s;tarv|ing. Being informed by him, it was in his power to make them comfortable for life, could they aid his e&s;cape, they had both &s;worn to &s;erve him to the utmo&s;t of their power. He added, that one of the&s;e men and Felix would be at the abbey gates a little before midnight; Felix being, for the fir&s;t time, &s;uffered to go out in &s;earch of adventures with this man. The meaning of this vi&s;it was, to con&s;ult on the mo&s;t likely &s;cheme of e&s;caping from the robbers, as too frequent attendance at the market might excite their &s;u&s;|picion.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t own I was not by any means plea&s;ed with this plan: I con&s;idered that the&s;e two men might act in this manner merely to fathom the inclinations of their new brother; and, in that ca&s;e, our re&s;idence would be di&s;co|vered to the villains al&s;o. There was now, however, no alternative; and Leonard attended at the out&s;ide gates exactly at the time."</P>
<P>Matilda here well recollected the &s;urpri&s;e and terror &s;he had &s;uffered at &s;eeing them enter the court, while &s;he was watching for the light in the we&s;t tower.</P>
<P>"He having conducted them to the parlour, I de&s;cended; and we began a con&s;ultation on the mo&s;t probable means of effecting lord Milverne's e&s;cape from the banditti. Nothing that was propo&s;ed &s;eemed to carry with it hopes of &s;ucce&s;s owing to the vigilance of the robbers, who, as was before ob&s;erved, detained one as a ho&s;tage for the return of the other. In &s;hort, we were not able to come to any determi|nation; and our little party broke up without having agreed
<PB N="70" REF="035833_0246_10093EB1AD4EBD58">
on any plan whatever. Leonard again conducted them out of the abbey, and we retired to our beds.</P>
<P>"The following day but one, you que&s;tioned Leonard again; and, according to my orders, he gave no &s;atisfac|tory an&s;wer, but was greatly &s;upri&s;ed to hear your deter|mination of leaving the abbey. This he communicated to me; and you, no doubt, well remember our conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject, which ended with your con&s;enting to con|tinue a fortnight longer: and, if the my&s;teries were not explained in that interval, you were immediately to repair to the convent of N**** in France. I mentioned the appearance of another per&s;on, to make you alter your re&s;o|lution, hoping by that time to have invented &s;ome contri|vance for the relea&s;e of lord Milverne.</P>
<P>"Leonard had, during this time, brought me word that the &s;ame vi&s;it would be repeated at the abbey again at mid|night. They were punctual at the hour; and he accord|ingly conducted them to the parlour, where I again at|tended.</P>
<P>"The only method that could now be thought of, was by the application of an herb, which, if taken to a certain quantity, would oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ion a death-like &s;leep, and was &s;imi|lar to the Turki&s;h poppies, though the juice was not of &s;o dangerous a nature. This idea was &s;ugge&s;ted by Uloff, the robber who accompanied Felix. He ob&s;erved the root might be ea&s;ily procured, and that, by the help of a little art, and this properly applied, the robbers might be led to believe lord Milverne dead; which would at once effect his e&s;cape; for it was a general rule among the banditti, to in|ter one another immediately in a vault which &s;tood near their cave&mdash;from which he might with ea&s;e extricate him|&s;elf, the coffins never being fa&s;tened down.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="035833_0247_10093EFBD49BF0A0">
"Strange as this thought was, there &s;eemed no other more likely to &s;ucceed; and I found that his lord&s;hip had agreed to carry this plan into execution, provided it met with our approbation, and Leonard could procure the herb.</P>
<P>"As Leonard was conducting them acro&s;s the court when leaving the abbey, the figure again appeared in the we&s;t tower; which greatly a&s;toni&s;hed them all.</P>
<P>"The next morning you informed me of the human form and lamp which you had &s;een reflected in the gla&s;s that &s;tood in your chamber. This account, added to the &s;trange voice which we both heard, made me re&s;olve to watch in the we&s;t tower; which I accordingly did.</P>
<P>"The &s;ame night, Felix and three others of the banditti (they having brought over one more to their intere&s;t) came to the abbey, unknown to either Leonard or me, to &s;ee if we had got the herb, as they were in hopes the next day to have a good opportunity of carrying their &s;cheme into exe|cution. They knocked at the outer gate, then bur&s;t it open, and proceeded directly to the parlour. The&s;e were the per&s;ons whom we mi&s;took for the officers of ju&s;tice, as their arrival was entirely unexpected, and neither Leonard nor my&s;elf had a &s;ight of them. Their intentions, therefore, proved fruitle&s;s; and they left the abbey, unable to find us.</P>
<P>"The next day Leonard attended at the place of ren|dezvous, and found Felix, who communicated to him their adventures the night before; and, having given him the herb, Leonard under&s;tood they intended ye&s;terday for the trial of its effect.</P>
<P>"This was accordingly done; and by the effects of it, and the help of Felix and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, his lord&s;hip was &s;hown to the whole of the banditti, as a corp&s;e. A coffin was therefore prepared, and in the evening he was convey|ed
<PB N="72" REF="035833_0248_10093EB4925AD270">
to the pede&s;tal, and buried with the u&s;ual ceremony; one of the robbers being habited like a monk."</P>
<P>The my&s;tery of the &s;trange funeral which Matilda &s;aw was now entirely elucidated.&mdash;Her brother continued&mdash;</P>
<P>"After the interment, the company returned to the cave; but Felix and one of the robbers were fixed on to go in &s;earch of adventures. They immediately, therefore, re|paired to the vault, and conducted lord Milverne here; af|ter which both joined their comrades as u&s;ual. But his lord&s;hip means to go to-day to a principal magi&s;trate &s;ome few miles from hence, and give an account of the&s;e depre|dators on the public. The whole of them will con&s;equent|ly be &s;eized: when Felix and the three converts to their cau&s;e will be &s;elected from the banditti, and the remainder left to take the due cour&s;e of the law."</P>
<P>Thus Alfred Ma&s;erini ended his narrative. But, though Matilda had heard many circum&s;tances of a &s;trange nature explained, which had cau&s;ed her con&s;iderable unea&s;ine&s;s, yet nothing had been &s;aid to clear up, in a &s;atisfactory manner, tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing events which &s;eemed in every de|gree to confirm the report of the abbey being haunted.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas had not cro&s;&s;ed her mind but a few minutes, before Alfred informed her that there was yet another tale to be related by one whom he expected every moment: "And I am certain," continued he, "that his &s;tory will clear away every mi&s;t of doubtful horror concerning this building, and obliterate every &s;uper&s;titious thought, by a clear elucidation of the my&s;teries that encompa&s;s it."</P>
<P>In about a quarter of an hour the folding doors again opened, and Father Peter &s;tood before them. Agnes, Ma|tilda, and even Leonard and lord Milverne, were a&s;toni&s;hed how he could enter from that part.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="035833_0249_10093EFE73AEE560">
"According to my promi&s;e la&s;t night," &s;aid the hermit, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Matilda, "I now, as you perceive, at|tend you here, fair lady."</P>
<P>Alfred's countenance was now transformed to the gaze of &s;urpri&s;e. "I find," &s;aid he &s;miling to his &s;i&s;ter, "we have al&s;o to expect explanations from you, Matilda."</P>
<P>"Indeed," an&s;wered &s;he, "the ta&s;k is &s;oon performed."</P>
<P>She then related to them her finding the manu&s;cript, and her journey on that account to Father Peter's cave, with the rea&s;ons for not giving it her brother the next morning.</P>
<P>Alfred's and the hermit's countenances glowed with plea&s;ure at the mention of &s;uch a paper having been found.</P>
<P>"No doubt," exclaimed the latter, "this will be a prin|cipal proof again&s;t the murderer of your father."</P>
<P>Matilda immediately produced it, and it was read by lord Milverne aloud. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the emo|tions of Alfred Ma&s;erini, as he li&s;tened to the di&s;tracted words of his wretched parent: &s;uffice it to &s;ay, they were equal to his &s;i&s;ter's at her fir&s;t peru&s;al of the parchment.</P>
<P>The party being in &s;ome mea&s;ure compo&s;ed, Father Peter was reque&s;ted by Alfred to relate tho&s;e circum&s;tances con|cerning Gra&s;ville Abbey, which had for years occa&s;ioned the mo&s;t horrid reports to be &s;pread, and worked with terrific &s;en&s;ations on the feelings even of tho&s;e who&s;e good &s;en&s;e had before taught them to de&s;pi&s;e every &s;uper&s;titious idea.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall, by your leave," an&s;wered the old man, "begin from the mo&s;t early period of my life, and proceed gra|dually through every event; which will all tend to now, that, however &s;trange the ways of Providence may appear to mortal eyes, yet in a due cour&s;e of time they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be productive of the greate&s;t happine&s;s and good to tho&s;e who are de&s;erving the protection of the Supreme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing,"</P>

<HEAD>THE HERMIT'S TALE.</HEAD>
<P>"BORN to a &s;plendid fortune, and brought up in all the elegance of an Italian noble, I attained my nineteenth year. My father, the baron Sampieno, was advi&s;ed to &s;end me to Madrid, not only to fini&s;h a particular part of my education, but for change of air, my health being in that &s;tate which gave them &s;erious alarm.</P>
<P>"At the &s;eminary to which I was &s;ent, another young Italian, of my own age, was al&s;o placed by his friends. His name was D'Ollifont: and our manners being greatly alike, gay, volatile, and di&s;&s;ipated, it was not to be won|dered at, that a con&s;iderable intimacy took place between us:&mdash;in &s;hort, we plunged together into every folly and vice which that gay and voluptuous city offered to our view; and, neither of us being under the &s;trict rules ob|&s;erved by the general &s;cholars, we had greater opportunities to follow every wild inclination, and gratify every wi&s;h we could form.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="035833_0251_10093F0123B87090">
"The con&s;equence of our ra&s;h behaviour was, a com|plaint of the governor to each of our parents, which gave them the greate&s;t alarm and unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;A con&s;ider|able decrea&s;e was, in con&s;equence, made in our allowances, and a &s;evere reprimand &s;ent us, for conduct which threaten|ed, in &s;ome degree, to bring di&s;grace on our family. The reproof, though to both exceedingly mortifying, was not &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to us as the curtailment of our &s;alaries, which would prevent our appearing among the extravagant &s;ociety we had become acquainted with, as we mu&s;t be ridiculed by tho&s;e who had more to expend in the luxuries of the place.</P>
<P>"As I was &s;itting, the day after I had received this in|formation from Italy, meditating on my uncomfortable &s;ituation, D'Ollifont entered, and told me of his having re|ceived &s;imilar intelligence.</P>
<P>"Do not give way to de&s;pair,' &s;aid he; 'but let us take &s;ome method to overcome the misfortune.'</P>
<P>"I at fir&s;t conceived he intended to write conciliatory letters of repentance; and, I mu&s;t own, my proud &s;oul did not altogether approve &s;uch a manner of proceeding; I therefore remained &s;ilent. But he &s;oon convinced me I had mi&s;taken his ideas, by informing me, in plain terms, he intended to commence gambler, and per&s;uading me to follow the &s;ame cour&s;e. 'I have not a doubt,' he conti|nued, 'but I &s;hall amply make amends for what I have lo&s;t in my quarterly allowance.'</P>
<P>"If I di&s;liked the idea of making conce&s;&s;ion, how much more did I abhor the thought of entering into &s;o mean and de&s;picable a profe&s;&s;ion as D'Ollifont had propo&s;ed! I was, indeed, greatly &s;hocked to find that he had &s;uch intentions.&mdash;I expo&s;tulated with him, on the di&s;grace, the infamy, of &s;uch a character, and attempted, to the utmo&s;t of my
<PB N="76" REF="035833_0252_10093EBAE8CE51D0">
ability, to paint in their true colours the mean and pitiful &s;hifts they were obliged to have recour&s;e to on many occa|&s;ions. I was, however, di&s;appointed in my endeavours to alarm his pride, and make him give up &s;o di&s;graceful a determination. In &s;hort, we parted in enmity.</P>
<P>"He &s;oon after began this direct cour&s;e to de&s;truction, and in a little time became connected with a gang who were well known for the defrauds of which they had been guilty. Nece&s;&s;ity, for the &s;ake of my own reputation, now obliged me to &s;hun one who&s;e principles and morals were univer&s;ally known and condemned. The &s;acrifice was greater than I expected; but at length, with &s;ome re&s;olu|tion, I got the better of my feelings, and enjoyed con&s;ide|rable happine&s;s in the thought of the danger I had e&s;caped.</P>
<P>"My di&s;po&s;ition became now more &s;ettled, and my manners entirely changed, from the wild career of youth to the more thoughtful deportment of manhood. The con|&s;equence of this alteration was a thorough reconciliation with my friends, and a greater &s;upply of money than I had ever received before.</P>
<P>"It is from this only that I can account for the deadly hate which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of D'Ollifont, again&s;t one whom he had at a former period called his friend, and who &s;till would have done any thing in his power to have reclaimed him from &s;o contemptible a mode of living&mdash;which it might now be properly called; his father having died, and left him but a &s;mall legacy: the bulk of his fortune he di&s;|po&s;ed of to a di&s;tant relation.</P>
<P>"Not long after this event, I had the misfortune to lo&s;e my parent, and, by his death, found my&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his title, and the whole of his property, which amounted to a con&s;iderable &s;um&mdash;there being no other children, and his wife having died when I was very young.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="035833_0253_10093F02A9FDE890">
"My affections had for &s;ome time been fixed on a lovely object, who had re&s;ided with her mother, near the academy where I was placed Beauty was her lea&s;t ornament; an amiable di&s;po&s;ition, added to an excellent under&s;tanding, made her, in my eyes, an object worthy to be the wife of a man even in a higher &s;ituation than my&s;elf, though &s;he had no fortune.</P>
<P>"After an interval of a few months from my father's death, I had the exqui&s;ite happine&s;s to receive my charm|ing Ca&s;&s;andra as my own. Spain was her native country; and, being unwilling to quit it, I re&s;olved to acquie&s;ce with her de&s;ire of &s;ettling there, as I had now no particular friends or relations in Italy. Seventeen years were &s;pent in a round of happine&s;s, which no mortal could enjoy in a greater degree than my&s;elf. One girl and two boys were the fruits of our con&s;tant love; both of the latter died when infants, and the care of the education of the former was mine and my Ca&s;&s;andra's chief employment. I need not tell you how we loved her&mdash;your own ideas mu&s;t paint to you that affection which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our brea&s;ts for this re|maining pledge of our felicity&mdash;when we &s;aw in her every grace, and every virtue which could adorn a female. Alas! tho&s;e &s;cenes of bli&s;s were not to la&s;t for ever, but after this period were &s;oon to be changed for mi&s;ery, angui&s;h, and a &s;eries of years clouded with glooms of &s;orrow and adver&s;i|ty, never to be era&s;ed."</P>
<P>The hermit &s;hed a few tears at the recollection, and was under the nece&s;&s;ity of pau&s;ing for &s;ome minutes, to com|po&s;e him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I had never &s;een D'Ollifont from &s;ome little time be|fore my marriage till the time I am &s;peaking of. An inter|val of near eighteen years had elap&s;ed: but yet his features were well known to me, though the greate&s;t alteration was
<PB N="78" REF="035833_0254_10093EBC6D0CF198">
vi&s;ible in his whole per&s;on. I now beheld him in the ut|mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, having, as he &s;aid, been obliged to fly from that part of Spain, where he had remained for a con&s;idera|ble time in the utmo&s;t di&s;grace, and in a &s;tate little better than &s;tarving. He related to me how truly he repented of the vicious life he had led, and that his only wi&s;h was now to procure, in &s;ome way, an hone&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by his own indu&s;try. I immediately offered him my hou&s;e, as an a&s;y|lum for the pre&s;ent, which he thankfully received, and lived with us after the manner of my own family. Dur|ing this time he behaved in a mo&s;t plea&s;ing and in&s;inuative manner to all; and there was not even one in the family but greatly re&s;pected and admired D'Ollifont.</P>
<P>"I rejoiced much in the reformation that had been ef|fected in him, and determined to &s;pare no expen&s;e or in|tere&s;t in the procurement of an office for him, on the emo|luments of which he might live comfortable and happy.</P>
<P>"Circum&s;tances continued in this &s;ituation for &s;ome lit|tle time; nor had any place become vacant, which I thought worthy to pre&s;ent to him: he, however, &s;till re|mained in my hou&s;e, and every day gained more general e&s;teem.</P>
<P>"One evening, having walked in my garden rather later than u&s;ual, I cut acro&s;s an unfrequented path to my hou&s;e: on one &s;ide of it was a thick grove of trees, the foliage of which entirely prevented any thing from being &s;een be|hind. It was a &s;pot &s;eldom intruded upon, in&s;omuch that in &s;ome parts it was nearly impa&s;&s;able. I had got about the middle of this place, when I heard D'Ollifont's voice mention with vehemence the name of my daughter. Though rather &s;urpri&s;ed at his manner, yet it awakened in me no &s;u&s;picion; and I was ju&s;t going to hail him, when words of a dreadful nature caught my ear.</P>

"This night,' &s;aid he to the per&s;on who was with him (a man of infamous character, and who had formerly been his &s;ervant) 'mu&s;t &s;he be &s;ecured.&mdash;You are &s;ure you well know the place?'</P>
<P>"Oh!' returned the other, 'let me alone for that!&mdash;and, egad! you have found out an excellent &s;pot; for, were the lady Lucretia's cries to be as loud as the town-bell, the devil take me if any one can hear her but tho&s;e who are with you! You will excu&s;e me though, &s;ignor: but I think your manner of proceeding is ridiculous: why not marry her? for then, &s;ome time or other, you may &s;tand a chance to come in for &s;ome of the baron's money.'</P>
<P>"Cur&s;es on him&s;elf and money!' exclaimed the vil|lain: 'I could have plundered him of that long ago; but the lo&s;s of it, as I told you before, would not make him half mi&s;erable enough: it is revenge I thir&s;t for, not gain; nor have I &s;o long played the hypocrite with him, but to invent &s;ome &s;cheme that may at once bla&s;t his happine&s;s. My hatred commenced again&s;t him when he &s;hrunk from the propo&s;als I made, and turned &s;age morali&s;t: but it has, if po&s;&s;ible, increa&s;ed tenfold &s;ince I have &s;een him flouri&s;h for years in pro&s;perity and honour, while I am doomed to live on the narrow limits of a &s;mall income. You may &s;ay he acts nobly now, and he has it in his power to be of con&s;iderable &s;ervice to me; but my proud &s;oul is rea|dy to bur&s;t every hour I am looked at as a dependent on his bounty; and I am continually become more anxious to work his downfal.'</P>
<P>"I heard no more, but trembled with the emotions of horror and pa&s;&s;ion. A wretch, whom I had &s;heltered un|der my roof with the true&s;t friend&s;hip&mdash;to plan the di&s;ho|nour of my child, was too much&mdash;I unfortunately had a loaded pi&s;tol in my belt; and, having torn away the

boughs which parted us, I &s;tood before the a&s;toni&s;hed rop|tile.</P>
<P>"He trembled, and turned pale, as did Eburne, who was with him; but the recollection of the former &s;till re|mained, to invent one of the mo&s;t damnable contrivances man could be the author of.</P>
<P>"Villain!' I exclaimed, and held the pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, 'do&s;t thou not de&s;erve to receive death at the hands of one whom, having the greate&s;t obligations to him, thou would&s;t cru&s;h to the earth and, fiend-like, grin at the mi&s;ery thou had&s;t brought upon him&s;elf and family?'</P>
<P>"During the time I uttered the&s;e words, a &s;ervant from the hou&s;e appeared in &s;ight, though not near enough to hear what pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I mean not,' I continued, &s;eeing him &s;hrink from me, 'to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate you. Doubtle&s;s, you have weapons, &s;tand, therefore, and defend your&s;elf.'</P>
<P>"I have none,' he cried: 'my life is in your power.'</P>
<P>"Da&s;tardly wretch!' exclaimed I.</P>
<P>"At that moment the &s;ervant came up: he was &s;ent from the hou&s;e to &s;eek me.&mdash;Unfortunately, the la&s;t few words of D'Ollifont, with my an&s;wer, was the only part of the conver&s;ation he heard. When, how was I a&s;toni&s;hed, to hear D'Ollifont exclaim, 'I will die &s;oon than commit &s;uch a defraud!' at the &s;ame in&s;tant producing a forged note on the bank of Venice. 'Here is a man' (&s;aid he to the &s;ervant, pointing to Eburne) 'who can witne&s;s that your ma&s;ter ju&s;t now threatened my life, unle&s;s I con&s;ent|ed to be a partner with him in pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e fal&s;e notes.'</P>
<P>"It is difficult to &s;ay which &s;tood the greate&s;t &s;tatue of &s;urpri&s;e and horror, the &s;ervant or my&s;elf; and it is proba|ble, had I not been prevented by him, I &s;hould have taken away my own life.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="035833_0257_10093F096720F3D8">
"Being at length more compo&s;ed, I reproached D'Olli|font in the bittere&s;t terms for his perfidy, and walked for|ward to my hou&s;e; but had not entered it above an hour before I found my&s;elf arre&s;ted on his accu&s;ation, and was that night, though all my friends interfered, dragged from my wife and child, to experience the mi&s;eries of a gaol.</P>
<P>"Picture to your&s;elf my &s;ituation: the night was &s;pent in di&s;tracted ravings, and the morning brought a vi&s;it from my Ca&s;&s;andra and her daughter, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;tored my &s;cattered &s;en&s;es; but it was only to experience pangs the mo&s;t poignant and &s;evere.</P>
<P>"D'Ollifont, and the wretch who was with him, &s;wore to my having &s;topped the former in the private walk of my own garden, when by him&s;elf; Eburne being then at &s;ome di&s;tance, though near enough to ob&s;erve all that pa&s;&s;ed: that fir&s;t, with fair words, I &s;trove to per&s;uade him to be an accomplice with my&s;elf in a forgery on the bank of Venice, and gave him a fal&s;e bill, informing him that I had many more of the &s;ame &s;ort; but that, finding him con|tinue ob&s;tinate in his refu&s;al, I had proceeded to extremi|ties, and, placing a pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, threatened to de|prive him of life, &s;hould he refu&s;e; that my intentions were fru&s;trated by Eburne, who, hearing the&s;e words, immedi|ately came forward.</P>
<P>"My own &s;ervant was examined, and confe&s;&s;ed, that when at &s;ome di&s;tance, he &s;aw me hold a pi&s;tol to D'Olli|font's brea&s;t; and, at his arrival at the &s;pot, heard him &s;ay he was unarmed; and that I only an&s;wered, 'Da&s;tardly wretch!'</P>
<P>"It was now the general conjecture that this affair would touch my life; at all events I was doomed to a pub|lic trial. It was in vain I pleaded my own tale, and the
<PB N="82" REF="035833_0258_10093EC38FC1FF20">
rea&s;ons for my behaviour: to every one, except tho&s;e to whom I was very well known, it carried in it &s;omething romantic that D'Ollifont &s;hould wi&s;h to debauch my daughter, which was &s;ure to end in his ruin, without even one chance to be benefited by the crime.</P>
<P>"During the interval between my impri&s;onment and the day of trial, D'Ollifont was &s;ent for to his relation, the count Ma&s;erini, in Italy, who&s;e health was in &s;uch a &s;tate that his life was even de&s;paired of, owing to the fal&s;e re|port of his children's death. He returned, however, at the time my trial was expected to be brought on, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of his uncle's e&s;tates and wealth.</P>
<P>"In the time of his ab&s;ence from Spain, a number of fal&s;e bills, the &s;ame as D'Ollifont had produced, were found, by the information of one of my own &s;ervants, bu|ried in a &s;mall che&s;t, near a &s;pot I u&s;ed much to frequent in my garden: this fre&s;h proof, which I had every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e to be planned by &s;ome &s;cheme in which the vil|lain Eburne was concerned, and who, I have no doubt, bribed my &s;ervant, added greatly to the horrid accu&s;ation again&s;t me. I had, therefore, entirely made up my mind to expect no mercy, and re&s;olved to prepare my&s;elf in that manner which would give me a degree of fortitude in my la&s;t moments, that &s;hould impre&s;s every one with &s;ome ideas of my innocence.</P>
<P>"The night preceding the awful day which was to de|cide my fate, my pri&s;on-doors flew open, and count D'Olli|font &s;tood before me. He &s;tarted back &s;ome &s;teps, at my wretched appearance; and a convul&s;ive trembling &s;howed that his con&s;cience touched him to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>"I fixed my eyes on him with a look which &s;eemed to add to his confu&s;ion, and was going to upbraid him, when he interrupted me. 'Hold!' he cried: 'I have even a
<PB N="83" REF="035833_0259_10093F0C03BCF478">
greater power over you than you &s;uppo&s;e. La&s;t night your daughter attempted to plunge a poignard in my brea&s;t; and there is little doubt that a &s;imilar &s;entence to that which pa&s;&s;es death upon you, will do the &s;ame by Lucretia.'</P>
<P>"I heard no more, but fainted before him. The keeper of the pri&s;on was called, and after &s;ome little time I re|covered. We were again left alone.</P>
<P>"D'Ollifont now told me there was yet one way to &s;ave both my&s;elf and child. The conditions he propo&s;ed were for me to go to Italy, and by a &s;acred oath promi&s;e to per|form &s;ome &s;ervices he &s;hould have occa&s;ion for. 'And I.' he continued, 'will &s;wear, in the &s;ame manner, that your family &s;hall go with you, and your fortune in every re&s;pect be &s;ecured.'</P>
<P>"Was it true that my daughter had made an attempt upon his life, I was certain the laws of Spain mu&s;t condemn her to death. Had my own exi&s;tence been only at &s;take, it is probable I &s;hould have &s;corned the villain's offer; knowing my Ca&s;&s;andra and her child were provided for by money I had placed in the hands of a friend, &s;o as to keep them above the frowns of fortune, in point of pecuniary concerns. But the idea of my Lucretia being cut off by an ignominious death, occa&s;ioned mo&s;t probably by love for me, in her revenge again&s;t my bittere&s;t enemy, cut me to the &s;oul; and almo&s;t any alternative would have been ac|cepted to &s;ave her. I demanded, however, the nature of tho&s;e &s;ervices, conceiving it might be &s;ome crime he dared not to undertake him&s;elf, and therefore had pitched on me to be the perpetrator of the deed.</P>
<P>"He &s;wore, by the mo&s;t &s;acred oath, that my conjectures were ill founded. Still my &s;oul revolted at the idea of &s;ubmitting to the villain in &s;o de&s;picable a manner, which would in the general opinion give te&s;timony of my guilt.
<PB N="84" REF="035833_0260_10093EC76E5999C0">
I refu&s;ed the offer, and he left the apartment in a rage. The next object which pre&s;ented it&s;elf was my wife in a &s;tate of di&s;traction; my child&mdash;my Lucretia&mdash;was in the &s;ame pri&s;on, and &s;ure to fall a victim to her ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>"My &s;ituation was little &s;hort of madne&s;s: I raved, but it was u&s;ele&s;s, and could not &s;ave her. Yet a way had been &s;hown me to pre&s;erve her; and I had refu&s;ed it. The keeper was called; I &s;ent him to D'Ollifont; the wretch appeared, and received, with a contemptuous &s;mile, my acquie&s;cence to his propo&s;als."</P>

<P>"THE proceedings, again&s;t me and Lucretia," conti|nued the hermit, "were now immediately &s;topped. I took the oath required: no one was found to appear again&s;t us on the day of trial: and the &s;ame night I embraced my wife and daughter in my own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"But my joy at the event was con&s;iderably damped by the general behaviour of my acquaintance, who &s;eemed to &s;hun both my&s;elf and family: in &s;hort, it was plain the method I had taken to evade public inve&s;tigation, was in &s;ome degree known; and, as I had before conceived, it was, in the common opinion, a confirmation of my con&s;cious guilt. This, at lea&s;t, reconciled me to one circum&s;tance, which I was bound to perform&mdash;that of leaving Spain immediately.</P>
<P>"Alas! this country (where I had &s;pent years of felicity&mdash;where I had been univer&s;ally re&s;pected and e&s;teemed by

every rank of people) was now become hateful to me; &s;ince almo&s;t every countenance &s;eemed to look towards me with a gloomy eye of &s;u&s;picion, even where I had before been welcomed, whenever I appeared, with &s;miles of friend&s;hip and confidence. My God! what were my &s;en|&s;ations! Sen&s;ible of my own innocence, ten thou&s;and deaths (could I my&s;elf alone have &s;uffered) would have been le&s;s torturing to me than the pre&s;ent ignominy. But when I &s;aw Lucretia bow to a young lady in the &s;treet where we lived, as &s;he pen&s;ively &s;at in the window between my&s;elf and wife, and &s;aw the &s;alute contemptuou&s;ly &s;miled at, and pa&s;&s;ed without being returned (while &s;he and her mother would bur&s;t into tears, and move from the &s;pot)&mdash;then would I utter to my&s;elf&mdash;'Better, had I &s;een my child executed with me, in the view of a gazing multitude, declaring my innocence, than thus to be doomed to &s;hrink under the wounds of bla&s;ted fame and &s;uppo&s;ed infamy.'</P>
<P>"My affairs were very &s;oon &s;ettled; and, with my wife and daughter (attended by one man and a woman-&s;ervant) I &s;et out for Genoa, where, according to appointment, I was to meet the author of all my mi&s;eries. Our journey was nece&s;&s;arily &s;low, on account of the ill health of my Ca&s;&s;andra, who had &s;uffered &s;o &s;evere a &s;hock from our late misfortunes, that I was under the greate&s;t alarm for her life.</P>
<P>"After &s;ome little time we arrived at the place of our temporary de&s;tination, and applying to a per&s;on to whom I had a recommendation, he informed me count D'Ollifont had been waiting for me two days, and that I might &s;ee him that night ar a certain place to which he would con|duct me. 'It is not publicly known,' &s;aid he, 'that he is in this country; con&s;equently &s;ecre&s;y is required.'</P>

"At my return to the inn I found my wife had been taken more violently ill than u&s;ual, in&s;omuch that Lucretia had &s;ent for a phy&s;ician, who had ju&s;t entered the hou&s;e. I a&s;ked his opinion on leaving the chamber: he declared her di&s;order to be a total decline, but did not then appre|hend any danger. Towards the latter part of the day &s;he grew better: but I re&s;olved not to mention my intended vi&s;it; and I contrived an excu&s;e, therefore, for my depar|ture at the hour I had fixed.</P>
<P>"It was &s;ome time after the clo&s;e of the evening, and nearly dark, when I met the man whom I had before &s;een in the morning. He told me to follow him. I rather he&s;itated. 'You have no rea&s;on for alarm,' &s;aid he, ob|&s;erving me attentively.</P>
<P>"I had a brace of pi&s;tols in my pocket; and, after a few moments of con&s;ideration, did as he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>"He fir&s;t led me down a pa&s;&s;age of con&s;iderable length, at the bottom of which he halted. Having produced a large key, he opened a &s;mall door, which di&s;covered a gloomy Gothic hall, lighted by a lamp, which was &s;u&s;pen|ded from the top. It was &s;upported by heavy Tu&s;can co|lumns; and, in different niches, were placed in order &s;e|veral &s;uits of armour. At the further end was a flight of &s;teps, on the top of which were a heavy pair of folding doors, arched over in the antique &s;tyle above, and &s;ecured in front by a grate-work of iron.</P>
<P>"My guide, when he got to the centre of this place, &s;eemed to fall back a few paces, as if thoughtful; and then, holding up the lantern he had in his hand, looked me full in the face. This behaviour I did not by any means like: it had the appearance of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and the gloom of the hall encouraged the idea. I immediately
<PB N="87" REF="035833_0263_10093F144B535290">
drew one of my pi&s;tols from my pocket. 'No treachery!' I exclaimed; 'or, by heavens, you die!'</P>
<P>"He &s;eemed di&s;concerted. 'By all that's &s;acred, I mean none; but only wi&s;hed to be certain I was right in the per&s;on I am conducting.'</P>
<P>"'Tis well!' I an&s;wered: 'proceed.'</P>
<P>"He did &s;o and led me up the &s;teps; then, taking from his pocket another key, he applied it to the lock of the iron grating. It required great exertions to turn it; but it at length yielded to the force, and divided in the middle, The door now only remained.</P>
<P>"Put up your pi&s;tol, &s;ignor:' &s;aid he: 'you have no|thing to fear.'</P>
<P>"This reque&s;t I po&s;itively refu&s;ed. He then blew a &s;mall horn, which he had in his belt; when the folding doors immediately flew open, and two blacks with drawn fabres &s;tood before us.</P>
<P>"A voice from the inner part now uttered&mdash;'Admit.' They directly drew back, and we pa&s;&s;ed through the en|trance. The doors in&s;tantly clo&s;ed, with &s;ome noi&s;e; and the blacks re&s;umed their &s;tation before them.</P>
<P>"My guide walked forward, and I followed with the pi&s;tol &s;till in my hand.</P>
<P>"It was a &s;pacious apartment, though gloomy; and fit|ted up with &s;ome degree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ance. A few wax tapers were placed round the walls; but the light they gave was dim and uncertain. In the middle was a long table, co|vered with green cloth; and on it were &s;pread various pa|pers, pens, ink, and a few books. A company of per&s;ons were &s;eated round it, of about twelve or thirteen, and one at the head of the table &s;eemed a kind of pre&s;ident in the a&s;&s;embly. Their cloaks were all muffled round them; and a black feather, which each wore in his hat, hung over

their faces, and added to the &s;olemnity of their dark, leng|thened vi&s;ages. He at the head, I however ob&s;erved, wore a white one.</P>
<P>"As I advanced, this per&s;on &s;poke; and I recogni&s;ed the wretch D'Ollifont. He a&s;ked why I mea&s;ured my &s;teps &s;o cautiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e,' I an&s;wered in a firm tone, 'I am afraid of treachery.'</P>

<PB N="89" REF="035833_0265_10093F11B28618E8">
for many miles, have encouraged ideas, from the gloomy appearance and Gothic &s;tructure of this ancient pile, that it is haunted; and it is actually nece&s;&s;ary, for the pre&s;ervation of the furniture, papers, and other valuables, of con&s;iderable amount, that the&s;e &s;u&s;picions &s;hould be kept alive; which will more effectually prevent intru&s;ion or robbery than any other method we can put into execution; the pea&s;ants of that part being a wild, untractable kind of people, and little better than general depredators on the public.</P>
<P>"You perhaps may wonder why we do not remove the&s;e articles; but my uncle's will particularly reque&s;ts every individual atom that was at his death, in the abbey, &s;hould remain there, and only be taken from it as my nece&s;&s;ity may require. Now there are various deeds and memoran|dums, relative to his different po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that we may never have the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to di&s;turb; and which, con|&s;equently, will be open to the violence of any one who&s;e curio&s;ity or villany may prompt him to u&s;e force in enter|ing the abbey. The &s;ervice that I have to reque&s;t from you is, the performance of &s;ome trifling ceremony, with a lamp, in the external part of the building, at night, either by pa&s;&s;ing the ca&s;ements with it in your hand, or fixing it for &s;hort periods of time at the different windows. This will be an innocent means of preventing inva&s;ion; and, by con&s;tantly vi&s;iting the abbey, your &s;cruples will be &s;a|tisfied i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> point of the extent of your oath.</P>
<P>"Your fortune will &s;upport you &s;o as to enjoy the &s;uper|fluities of life; and your re&s;idence may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at any part near the abbey. But one condition, continued he, goes further&mdash;that if at any time, though many years hence, you di&s;cover per&s;ons to enter the abbey, and re&s;ide there, without notice from me, you &s;hall immediately take every means in your power to rai&s;e in them alarms of &s;u|pernatural
<PB N="90" REF="035833_0266_10093ECEE7911AC8">
appearances, and by that means drive them from the &s;pot. For your better convenience, there is a cave on one &s;ide of the wood which &s;urrounds the abbey, that is never intruded upon, nor indeed hardly known by any one in the place:&mdash;you may go to it of an evening; and from thence proceed, through a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, to the building. If, after two years' con&s;tant performance of the&s;e injunctions, no interruption is perceived, you will not then be confined to the u&s;ual ceremony; but yet it is reque&s;ted that a continual watch &s;hall be kept upon it; and, as I before ob&s;erved, if intruded on, even fifty years to come, and both of us living, every means is to be u&s;ed in the above-mentioned manner, to terrify all vi&s;itors to a removal.'</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t confe&s;s, this reque&s;t, &s;trange as it was, &s;eemed far more agreeable to me than what I expected; and I conceived that, were there any villany lurking under it, I might di&s;cover the &s;ource, and, without going from my oath, be of con&s;iderable &s;ervice to the injured; and, one time or other, have it in my power to retaliate on D'Olli|font. I reque&s;ted that the agreement &s;hould be drawn up, on paper, that I might adhere to it, in time to come, with|out an idea of having forgotten its tendency.</P>
<P>"This was agreed to, and in the cour&s;e of an hour it was fini&s;hed. I carefully read the paper, and found it exactly corre&s;ponded with what D'Ollifont had &s;aid, and then again &s;wore, as I had before promi&s;ed to do, that I would punctually fulfil it.

We then left the hall; and, that door being al&s;o locked, I &s;oon found my&s;elf at the end of the place where we entered:&mdash;my companion then wi&s;hed me a good night, and we parted.</P>
<P>"A heavy load now &s;eemed to have fallen from me; for the expectation of what D'Ollifont's reque&s;t might be, had driven me almo&s;t to madne&s;s; and though even now I dete&s;ted the meanne&s;s I had &s;ubmitted to, yet, in &s;ome degree, I was reconciled, when recollection whi&s;pered me that I had &s;aved the life of my Lucretia, the beloved child of my heart.</P>
<P>"Plea&s;ed with the ideas of the plea&s;ure I &s;hould convey to Ca&s;&s;andra in relating the &s;ervice I was to perform (her dread of it having been equal to my own) I &s;hortly found my&s;elf at the inn where we re&s;ided.

She knew me (though &s;he had been in&s;en&s;ible for nearly an hour) and exclaimed, 'My hu&s;band, the Al|mighty aid thee!' Then, turning her eyes towards her daughter, &s;he &s;eemed inwardly to &s;upplicate heaven in her behalf; and, heaving a &s;oft &s;igh, expired in my arms. Lucretia fainted, and was &s;upported by Stella, who had ju&s;t brought the draught, while I remained lo&s;t for &s;ome time in gloomy &s;orrow and &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>"At length, turning to the phy&s;ician, I de&s;ired to know why he had flattered me with hopes that &s;he might live for a length of time. He only an&s;wered by &s;haking his head, and &s;aying the di&s;order had come to a cri&s;is &s;ooner than he expected. He left the inn, and I (having ordered my daughter to be put to bed, and committed the care of the funeral to my confidential &s;ervant Ja&s;per) retired to my own room, overwhelmed with the mo&s;t poignant grief.</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the angui&s;h &s;uffered by my&s;elf and child on this mournful event: I &s;hall there|fore draw a veil over the &s;cene, a recollection of which is even now almo&s;t too much for me."</P>
<P>The hermit here was con&s;trained to make a pau&s;e of &s;ome few minutes, while he paid a tributary tear to the memory of &s;o beloved a wife.</P>

<P>"After a long day's journey, a prey to the deepe&s;t melancholy, we arrived at Montferrat, and &s;topped at a

tolerably-built cottage; the owner of which, fortunately, had an inclination, and al&s;o convenience, to accommodate us with board and lodging for &s;ome weeks. The &s;ituation &s;uited me for the pre&s;ent, as it was extremely retired.</P>
<P>"On the night and hour appointed, accompanied by Ja&s;per, whom I was permitted to acquaint with the cir|cum&s;tances I was involved in, I attended the place of ren|dezvous, where I was to be met by the per&s;on deputed by D'Ollifont.</P>
<P>"We were both punctual; and, as I was &s;till fearful of treachery from &s;o vile a character, both my&s;elf and &s;ervant were armed. He was alone: his figure, which I could now more fully ob&s;erve, was noble and maje&s;tic; his coun|tenance very hand&s;ome, though there was a fiercene&s;s in his eyes, added to the turn of his dark brows, which made it in &s;ome re&s;pects terrific.</P>
<P>"Follow me,' &s;aid he, 'and I will conduct you to the place you have before heard of.'</P>
<P>"He led us to the cave I now inhabit. We entered, and he &s;howed me the parts which you have already &s;een; but after &s;ome little time he opened a concealed door, that di&s;covered a &s;mall room. From hence we de|&s;cended, by a trap artfully jointed to the floor, a number of &s;teps, at the bottom of which was an arched &s;ubterrane|our pa&s;&s;age, entirely dark: our guide, however, was pro|vided with a lamp, by which he lighted another place again&s;t the wall. We followed him along this place for &s;o con&s;iderable a length of time that I knew not how far he might have taken us, and halted at the idea.</P>

At the top we entered a &s;mall &s;ubterraneous room, in which was a &s;tool, a table, &s;ome eatables and wine; with a bed, which &s;howed (though empty now) it was daily occupied. Our guide pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t a &s;pring, in a manner which he particularly explained; and, by a kind of mechani&s;m, aided by clock-work placed at the further part of the apartment, a &s;quare of about five feet of the cieling above gradually fell within two feet of the floor on which we &s;tood: this I jumped upon, and, by a &s;econd pre&s;&s;ure of the foot on a certain part, it ro&s;e in the &s;ame manner that it fell, and clo&s;ed with equal nicety; by which means I found my&s;elf in that room oppo&s;ite to the one we are now in.</P>
<P>"The night was exceeding gloomy: con&s;iderable claps of thunder followed each other (though they &s;eemed at a di&s;tance) and faint fla&s;hes of lightning darted on the ca&s;e|ments. Both my &s;ervant and conductor were &s;oon with me, by the &s;ame means that I had a&s;cended; and we all three proceeded through this room to the hall, where we were met by a mean, meagre-looking fellow with al&s;o a lamp in his hand, that reflected on a countenance I did not by any means approve.</P>
<P>"It was now late, and a more than common oppre&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to weigh on my &s;pirits. Our guide &s;aluted this man. 'Enuchio,' &s;aid he, 'has there been any interrup|tion &s;ince the count la&s;t &s;aw you?</P>
<P>"None, &s;ignor,' he an&s;wered, 'and I have regularly performed my duty with this lamp every night.'</P>

<P>"In pa&s;&s;ing through one of the chambers, Ja&s;per (who was behind, and partly in the dark) ran again&s;t a &s;uit of ar|mour that was placed there, with &s;everal implements of war, &s;ome of which are now in one of the rooms under the upper apartments.

<P>"WE were all &s;urpri&s;ed at the noi&s;e: at length &s;ignor Ranolpho (which I now found was the name of our guide) &s;aid he &s;uppo&s;ed it proceeded from the curio&s;ity of &s;ome travellers who were pa&s;&s;ing that way.&mdash;I cannot &s;ay I was by any means well &s;atisfied with this conjecture; but I made no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"After having received many in&s;tructions from him, concerning the different pieces of mechani&s;m contrived in this building, I remarked, with a look of &s;ome a&s;toni&s;h|ment, that it was to me amazing, count D'Ollifont &s;hould have put him&s;elf to &s;uch expen&s;e and trouble, when the ex|ertions of the civil power, under ju&s;t claims, might have an&s;wered the purpo&s;es he wi&s;hed to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>"Ranolpho &s;eemed confu&s;ed: after a pau&s;e he an&s;wer|ed, 'Your ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t; but were the application made to the &s;uperior power of Italy, the curio&s;ity of the pea&s;antry would be &s;till more con&s;iderably heightened; and I have doubts whether the vigilance of the mo&s;t &s;crutini|&s;ing per&s;ons could protect this place from their inva&s;ion. It al&s;o would gain count D'Ollifont a bad name, which might, through their ignorance, occa&s;ion &s;u&s;picions and re|marks the mo&s;t injurious to his character. Be&s;ides,' he continued, 'the chief part of the&s;e articles of machinery were erected many years back, when this &s;tructure was in|habited by the monks, they made u&s;e of them to terrify per&s;ons of different &s;entiments in religious points to their own way of thinking, whom the chance of war had made their pri&s;oners, and who accordingly were confined in their own abbey. By the&s;e arts, the victims of their &s;uper&s;ti|tion
<PB N="97" REF="035833_0273_10093F210A6DDC60">
were taught to believe the holy fathers worked mira|cles by their faith.'</P>
<P>"There was a kind of equivocation in this &s;peech, which I by no means liked, though I forbore to make any reply. What he &s;aid, however, concerning &s;everal of the traps, &amp;c. being formed at a di&s;tant period of time, I found to be true, by the general appearance of the age of the workman|&s;hip; though there was not a doubt but they had lately been repaired and put in order.</P>
<P>"After a little time we all left the abbey, and proceed|ed to the cave, where it was &s;ettled that I &s;hould meet Enu|chio at that &s;pot, and at the &s;ame hour, the following night. Ranolpho &s;aid he &s;hould leave Montferrat the next morn|ing, and make the be&s;t of his way immediately after D'Ol|lifont to Spain.</P>
<P>"We then parted. Ja&s;per and my&s;elf &s;oon arrived at the cottage, after &s;ome conver&s;ation on the &s;trange events we had witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I acquainted Lucretia with every circum&s;tance relative to the abbey; and, though &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable anxiety for my &s;afety, yet, like my&s;elf, &s;he was happy to find the reque&s;t of D'Ollifont was no wor&s;e. I, however, made her &s;till more ea&s;y, by a&s;&s;uring her I never intended to vi&s;it the building, unaccompanied by Ja&s;per.</P>
<P>"In le&s;s than a month I hired a hou&s;e, very little di&s;tant from the cottage: it was not large, though neat and ele|gant; and, there being only my daughter and my&s;elf, a few dome&s;tics were &s;ufficient to form our hou&s;ehold. I did not, however, intend to live by any means private or retired, though my own wi&s;hes prompted me to it. I trembled for the health of my child: it had been on the decline ever &s;ince the commencement of our misfortunes; and the poignant grief &s;he &s;uffered for the lo&s;s of her mo|ther,
<PB N="98" REF="035833_0274_10093F683B51F960">
now &s;eemed &s;ettled to a deep melancholy, which I dreaded to ob&s;erve, and which my own health and &s;pirits, I conceived, helped to increa&s;e.</P>
<P>"It was for the&s;e rea&s;ons, therefore, that I puni&s;hed my&s;elf, in receiving and paying vi&s;its to per&s;ons of di&s;tinc|tion, for &s;ome miles round; and I could perceive, in &s;ome degree, it contributed to le&s;&s;en that weight of oppre&s;&s;ion which &s;eemed to lie &s;o heavy on her &s;oul.</P>
<P>"A month had not elap&s;ed after my removal to my new dwelling, before a confu&s;ed report was &s;pread that Percival Ma&s;erini and his &s;i&s;ter were yet living, and in Italy.</P>
<P>"This intelligence &s;eemed, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to unravel a part of the my&s;terious manner and reque&s;t of D'Ollifont: but I mu&s;t own, the elucidations I pictured to my&s;elf were by no means favourable to him; and dark &s;chemes of vil|lany &s;eemed to unfold them&s;elves to my view. But &s;till I could do nothing; I was bound by my oath; and &s;u&s;pi|cions were of no avail. I and Ja&s;per vi&s;ited the abbey eve|ry night; and, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, I made every &s;earch that was po&s;&s;ible, to find a clue to D'Ollifont's conduct, which I &s;uppo&s;ed might be concealed in &s;ome part of the building: my endeavours, however, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful Enuchio &s;till continued near the place: and I could not but &s;u&s;pect that he was a kind of watch upon my conduct. His very looks &s;eemed to indicate the blacke&s;t thoughts; and his manners confirmed the idea.</P>
<P>"About this period, among the many foreigners who frequented my villa as they pa&s;&s;ed through Montferrat, was lord Albourne, a young Engli&s;hman of rank and con&s;idera|ble fortune."</P>
<P>Matilda and Alfred &s;tarted at the name; but they for|bore to interrupt the hermit, who accordingly proceeded&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="035833_0275_10093F55CA54F178">
"His manner plea&s;ed both my&s;elf and daughter; in &s;hort, there was a kind of noble &s;incerity in his di&s;po&s;ition, which on a little further acquaintance charmed me.&mdash;I mu&s;t allow I felt a con&s;iderable happine&s;s, on ob&s;erving a mutu|al affection take place between my Lucretia and this noble|man.&mdash;His character, I under&s;tood from corre&s;pondents whom I could depend upon in England, was unblemi&s;hed; and I knew I could be&s;tow on my child a fortune worthy of &s;uch a hu&s;band. Suffice it to &s;ay, he declared his &s;enti|ments; and &s;he, above the little arts of female coquetry, confe&s;&s;ed &s;he loved him. But &s;till there were &s;ome ob&s;ta|cles to the marriage. Lord Albourne had not yet been ac|quainted with my misfortunes, or with Lucretia's attempt on D'Ollifont's life. To Lucretia there was al&s;o another impediment: &s;he mu&s;t part with me for &s;ome time; his lord&s;hip had promi&s;ed, after &s;ettling his affairs in England, he would return with her, and con&s;ent to remain in Mont|ferrat during my life time. But it would, at lea&s;t, take twelve months to tran&s;act the&s;e affairs. The&s;e twelve months' ab&s;ence &s;eemed to her a century, and darkened every pro&s;pect of felicity &s;he might have hoped to have en|joyed. At length, however, the&s;e ob&s;tacles were overcome; lord Albourne was, by me, informed of the &s;ufferings I had undergone, and of Lucretia's impetuo&s;ity, in attempting to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the author of my misfortunes. His lord&s;hip &s;ympathi&s;ed with me in my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and admired the he|roic love of my child, though he was &s;orry &s;he had thrown her&s;elf into the power of &s;uch a wretch.</P>
<P>"The latter objection was at length over-ruled by him and, I may &s;ay, con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened by D'Ollifont, from whom at this period I received a letter in terms of the warm|e&s;t friend&s;hip, and breathing, in &s;ome degree, a regret for the angui&s;h he had cau&s;ed. The contents of it informed
<PB N="100" REF="035833_0276_10093F6AD1104170">
me, that (it having been hinted to him that my health was in a precarious &s;tate, and that travelling would, very pro|bably, prove of infinite &s;ervice) he would undertake that &s;ome one &s;hould perform my part in the abbey, if I cho&s;e to take a journey for two months to re-e&s;tabli&s;h my con&s;ti|tution. D'Ollifont's character was now too well known to me for me to conceive one favourable trait in his di&s;po|&s;ition; otherwi&s;e, this deception might have pa&s;&s;ed for an act of kindne&s;s and repentance. I &s;trangely &s;u&s;pected &s;ome &s;oul deeds were to be executed in my ab&s;ence, and at fir&s;t re&s;olved not to accept the offer: but, at length, overcome by the tears of Lucretia, and the per&s;ua&s;ions of lord Al|bourne, I con&s;ented to accompany them to France, but de|termined to return at lea&s;t a fortnight before the limited time.</P>
<P>"My &s;ituation was critical; I dared not communicate my &s;u&s;picions to any one, except Ja&s;per: my oath for|bade it. My &s;urpri&s;e, however, was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by finding that Percival Ma&s;erini and his &s;i&s;ter were actual|ly in Italy; and that the former, by the authority of the king of Sardinia, had &s;ent to Spain, to demand the keys of Gra&s;ville Abbey from count D'Ollifont, that the building might be &s;earched, to find if another will could be produc|ed of the late count Ma&s;erini, in favour of his children be|fore his nephew.</P>
<P>"An idea now &s;truck me, which I con&s;idered would at once give me an opportunity of di&s;covering the dark machi|nations of D'Ollifont re&s;pecting the abbey, though ab&s;ent from Montferrat.</P>
<P>"I therefore wrote a &s;hort an&s;wer to his letter, &s;aying I &s;hould accept the vacation he offered me. At the &s;ame time I determined to leave Ja&s;per at my hou&s;e, concealed, that they might &s;uppo&s;e he was al&s;o with me. I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w I
<PB N="101" REF="035833_0277_10093F25876D5248">
could depend on his fidelity, courage, and under&s;tanding. To him, therefore, I related the forebodings of my own mind, and gave him in&s;tructions accordingly, with a par|ticular caution, that, &s;hould he find any one was confined there, or any treacherous &s;chemes whatever going forward, he &s;hould immediately write to me, and (on the receipt of this token) I &s;hould come po&s;t, and incognito, to my villa.</P>
<P>"Lord Albourne and Lucretia were &s;hortly united, after an acquaintance of only &s;ix months; and, as &s;oon as the ceremony was performed, we &s;et off for France. Our journey was plea&s;ant; and if ever I enjoyed one gleam of comfort after my misfortunes in Spain, and the lo&s;s of my Ca&s;&s;andra, it was in this &s;hort period. A gloom, however, &s;till hung over the countenance of Lucretia; the idea of leaving me proved a continual drawback on her felicity; and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing day was &s;omewhat ha&s;tened by a letter from Ja&s;per, reque&s;ting me to return immediately.</P>
<P>"That fortitude, however, which I conceived I &s;hould exert when I parted with the only prop of my exi&s;tence, failed me entirely at the afflicting moment; and (in&s;tead of being able to &s;upport her through the trial) I found I in a great mea&s;ure added to her grief, by the pangs I &s;uf|fered my&s;elf, which were too acute to be concealed. Lord Albourne &s;eemed to &s;hare the &s;orrows of us both; and (after &s;hedding tears on my head) he removed his wife from my arms, that in&s;en&s;ibly held her to my brea&s;t, and hur|ried her, in a fainting fit, to the carriage, which with cruel, &s;wiftne&s;s &s;oon bore her from my &s;ight.</P>
<P>"Alas! every beam of plea&s;ure &s;eemed now vani&s;hed, and the melancholy pro&s;pects of my mind received another tint of darkne&s;s, horror, and mi&s;ery. But a few months back, I had been the happie&s;t of mortals&mdash;the father of a lovely, amiable child, the hu&s;band of an angelic wife,
<PB N="102" REF="035833_0278_10093F6D6635C0E8">
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of an unblemi&s;hed reputation: now was I an exile, though in my native country; bereft of wife, child, and even reputation, in the eyes of the world; labouring under a &s;tigma of &s;hattered fame, never to be recovered.</P>
<P>"Tormented with tho&s;e ideas, I &s;et out on my return to Italy; but, unfortunately, was detained, through many incidents on the road, for near three days. I, immediately on my arrival at my villa, had a private conference with Ja&s;per.</P>
<P>"His countenance &s;howed he had much to tell, and that of a dreadful nature. He informed me that, after my departure, he kept him&s;elf as &s;ecret as po&s;&s;ible, according to my orders, and only went out by night, and then con|cealed him&s;elf at a place near the cave. The &s;econd time of his watching, he perceived Enuchi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and three others, whom he did not by any means like, cautiou&s;ly enter it about midnight, and, &s;ome time after, he &s;aw a light pa&s;s one of the ca&s;ements in the we&s;t tower of the abbey; but though he remained at the &s;ame place till near day|break, he never &s;aw them return. He attended again the next evening at an early hour, but &s;aw no one go that way, though a light and the figure of a man moved &s;everal times, in the cour&s;e of three, hours, before the different windows. He therefore concluded that tho&s;e whom he had &s;een the night before had taken up their habitation en|tirely in the abbey. He &s;till, however, continued to keep a watchful eye on the building.</P>
<P>"On the eighth day &s;ome confu&s;ion was experienced among the pea&s;antry. A &s;ignor Balvolio, a phy&s;ician, with officers of ju&s;tice, and a &s;ervant of Percival Ma&s;erini ar|rived at Montferrat, to &s;earch for him. He had the night before, according to the &s;ervant's account, entered the ab|bey, while the man waited for him without; who fell a|&s;leep

&s;leep, and did not awake till morning: he then entered to look after his ma&s;ter, but his exertions proved fruitle&s;s; he was no where to be found. His foot&s;teps were traced to an apartment in the we&s;t tower; where al&s;o a picture, which he wore next his heart, was found, the ribbon of which &s;eemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orn by force; but from this room no other &s;igns of him could be traced.</P>
<P>"Ja&s;per was equally a&s;toni&s;hed and alarmed at this in|telligence. He had omitted to attend at the u&s;ual place the night before, having been extremely ill; he, however, contrived to be among tho&s;e who entered with the &s;trangers to &s;earch the building, and with them examined that very apartment of the we&s;t tower, where with me he had oft|times performed the u&s;ual ceremonies with the lamp. He then, with the re&s;t, left the abbey, and heard it agreed on, between the phy&s;ician and officers, that the doors and out|er gates &s;hould be left unlocked.</P>
<P>"On his return home he directly &s;ent off a letter to me, acquainting me with the&s;e proceedings; but, unfortunate|ly, I had, the day before the arrival of it at the place it was directed to, &s;et off for another part of France; and Ja&s;|per, after &s;ome time, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he mortification to receive it a|gain unopened.</P>
<P>"In this interval he was, however, by no means idle, and he determined, let the hazard be what it would, to go over the abbey him&s;elf at midnight. He at the &s;ame time re&s;olved to enter from the principal gates, being aware, did he attempt to pa&s;s the &s;ecret pa&s;&s;age, there was hardly a doubt but he &s;hould be interrupted.</P>
<P>"This &s;cheme he carried into execution, and proceeded, well armed, with a dark lantern, to the hall. He had not remained, in an ob&s;cure part of it, above five minutes, be|fore Enuchio and two others came forth from that apart|ment;
<PB N="104" REF="035833_0280_10093F71594EBE98">
which proved they mu&s;t have been in the &s;ubterra|neous chamber, and con&s;equently had a&s;cended by means of the trap. The&s;e men had, all three, lamps, and &s;hortly after they were followed by a figure of noble mien, muf|fled up in his cloak, and his hat, in which was a white feather, flapped over his eyes. But how was Ja&s;per a&s;to|ni&s;hed, when, by the light of one of their lamps, which glar|ed on his countenance, he di&s;covered the features of D'Ol|lifont!</P>
<P>"Being now more fully convinced that the mo&s;t horrid treachery and villany was going forward, though every moment in danger of being di&s;covered, he per&s;i&s;ted in fol|lowing them at &s;ome little di&s;tance. They proceeded &s;low|ly through the iron gate that leads to the ruins of a once magnificent place of wor&s;hip, and walked to the centre, on which part &s;tands a tomb to the memory of a monk, who in former times was a &s;uperior of this abbey.</P>
<P>"One of the men having put down a &s;mall ba&s;ket, co|vered lightly over with a cloth, which &s;eemed to contain &s;ome provi&s;ion, they all four entered the tomb. But it was impo&s;&s;ible for Ja&s;per to follow them here al&s;o; as the &s;ize would hardly have admitted five per&s;ons to keep far enough apart in it to prevent di&s;covery.</P>
<P>"He heard a kind of noi&s;e which plainly told they were opening a large trap, and it &s;eemed to require the exertions, of three of them. He heard D'Ollifont &s;peak: 'Take down the provi&s;ions; I will remain here. Leave the ba&s;|ket, and &s;ay nothing.' Ja&s;per &s;uppo&s;ed they did &s;o; for, after &s;ome little time, he heard them replace the trap; and they pa&s;&s;ed by him as they returned to the apartment from whence they came.</P>
<P>"He immediately, by the &s;ame method he had entered, quitted the abbey, &s;hocked at what he had been witne&s;s to
<PB N="105" REF="035833_0281_10093F2B5F326F58">
and entirely at a lo&s;s in what manner to act. He knew him&s;elf to be entangled by a promi&s;e of &s;ecre&s;y, &s;imilar to that of mine, on which terms only I had been &s;uffered to make him my confidant; but yet he was certain, as well as my&s;elf, that it did not prevent our aid or a&s;&s;i&s;tance to any one di&s;tre&s;&s;ed or confined in the building; or our exertions to fru&s;trate any plans of wickedne&s;s or cruelty which the count might form, provided we did not di&s;cover tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances in which we were involved relative to the light, &amp;c. Our &s;ituations were both extremely delicate; and though we would have ri&s;ked our lives in the &s;ervice of the unfortunate, yet we could not but recollect with horror the forfeiture incurred by the breach of an awful oath.</P>

<P>"JASPER at length fixed on a &s;cheme, which effectual|ly confirmed his wi&s;hes to &s;erve the unfortunate, by the courage and ingenuity he di&s;played in the execution of it. He determined to let the much injured Percival Ma&s;erini know (if &s;uch a per&s;on there was in the abbey&mdash;a circum|&s;tance of which he had little if any doubt) that there was one who was acquainted with his unhappy &s;ituation, and pitied him&mdash;nay, would run all hazards to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to e&s;|cape, if he could contrive any &s;tratagem that carried in it the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Words to this purpo&s;e he wrote on a &s;heet of paper, at the &s;ame time mentioning he would attend in the tomb the next night, at an early hour, before the u&s;ual attendance of D'Ollifont and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants;
<PB N="106" REF="035833_0282_10093F742A82B890">
a feeble hope inducing him to think they might conver&s;e together, though with difficulty.</P>
<P>"A &s;udden idea now &s;truck him, which had nearly over|ruled his pre&s;ent determination. Why not immediately apply to the civil power, whom he could at once lead to the place of confinement; and, by proof, cru&s;h D'Ollifont and the wretches concerned? The pen dropped from his hand: he ro&s;e with joy at the thought. He&s;itation and reflection again &s;topped him: he knew not how I would have acted in this ca&s;e. Strong as were his &s;u&s;picions, they were as yet but &s;u&s;picions. Should he make them publicly known, and, at this cri&s;is, &s;hould they fail, (which, though entirely improbable, was not actually an impo&s;&s;i|bility) it was uncertain in what &s;tate he might involve both him&s;elf and me. But this might, at lea&s;t, be done at the la&s;t extremity, and in two days more he expected I &s;hould return.</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, he proceeded as he had before intended, and accordingly fini&s;hed his note&mdash;not without, however, men|tioning, at the latter part, hints of the di&s;agreeable ties that entangled him with D'Ollifont. Another con&s;ideration now interrupted him: he wi&s;hed to &s;ign a name, but not either his own or mine; that, in ca&s;e the letter &s;hould be di&s;covered, it might not, at the fir&s;t in&s;tant, be apparent who was the author of it. After &s;ome little time he wrote at the bottom, 'Father Peter,' that it might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ome holy man, who, di&s;daining the idle talk relative to the abbey, had made it a place for his meditations, and had con&s;equently di&s;covered what was going forward.</P>
<P>"Ja&s;per, at night, attended at a particular &s;pot in the chapel. In a &s;hort time he heard them enter, but could not perceive D'Ollifont. One of them, whom he had no|ticed the night before, he now di&s;covered to be Eburne.&mdash;
<PB N="107" REF="035833_0283_10093F2F145E2068">
They immediately walked to the tomb, and followed each other in; the ba&s;ket, as on the former night, was &s;lightly covered with a cloth, and put down on the out&s;ide of the door, while they removed the trap. Ja&s;per now &s;aw the opportunity he wi&s;hed to make u&s;e of; and, while they were bu&s;ily employed, he advanced, turned the cloth on one &s;ide from the top of the ba&s;ket, thru&s;t the paper down among the provi&s;ion, and replaced the covering as he found it. In le&s;s than a minute after he had returned to his hid|ing place, one of them came forth, and took it away: he &s;oon after heard the trap clo&s;ed; and, again pa&s;&s;ing him, they returned, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, to the &s;ubterraneous room, while he left the abbey, elated, in &s;ome degree, with the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme.</P>
<P>"The next night arrived; and Ja&s;per, with another let|ter, repaired, as &s;oon as it was dark, to the chapel, with a palpitating heart for the i&s;&s;ue of his undertaking. He en|tered the tomb, put his mouth to the trap, which, with &s;ome trouble, he found; then called &s;everal times, but received no an&s;wer: he repeated the name of Ma&s;erini &s;till louder, till he was afraid he had di&s;covered him&s;elf to D'Ol|lifont's party. Soon after, he thought he heard a kind of groaning from below; but it was indi&s;tinct and faint: in &s;hort, he was now certain the cell was &s;o low, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to exchange words with any one beneath. His di&s;|appointment, however, did not abate his per&s;everance; and he now waited to place his note, in which he had re|lated the regret he felt at not being able to hear him; and, after begging him to &s;upport him&s;elf with fortitude, he de|clared his intending, if every &s;cheme failed, to apply to the magi&s;tracy of the place.</P>
<P>"The men, as u&s;ual, approached; but D'Ollifont was again ab&s;ent. One of them carried the ba&s;ket: unfortu|nately
<PB N="108" REF="035833_0284_10093F75B01D71A0">
he did not place it before the door, but took it with him into the tomb; in con&s;equence of which, Ja&s;per was unable to &s;end the paper he had got ready. After they left the chapel, he departed from the abbey, overwhelmed with chagrin and di&s;tre&s;s at the failure of his enterpri&s;e. The next morning brought the letter which he had wrote to me, back again, with information that no &s;uch per&s;on could be found at the place where it was directed. He immediately di&s;patched another, which found me at B***.</P>
<P>"One more night he re&s;olved to try if Fortune would favour him; and he determined, &s;hould &s;he not, to run all hazards, and apply for ju&s;tice the following day.</P>
<P>"He was ju&s;t going to leave the hou&s;e, when he ob&s;erv|ed three men lurking about it, as if watching it; he there|fore waited &s;ome little time before he &s;et off. About half an hour after, he perceived they were gone; and ac|cordingly walked towards the abbey. He had but ju&s;t arrived at one of the &s;olitary avenues leading to the principal gate, when the &s;ame three men, as he &s;uppo&s;ed. ru&s;hed from behind &s;ome thick foliage of cedar, and de|manded his money. They, however, waited for no an&s;wer, but knocked him down: they then rifled his pockets; and, after giving him &s;everal blows on the head, and &s;tabs with a dagger in the &s;ide and brea&s;t, left him, doubtle&s;s with an idea that he was dead.</P>
<P>"In this &s;tate he continued till morning, when he in &s;ome degree recovered his &s;en&s;es, though unable to move, and almo&s;t to &s;peak. His &s;ituation was dreadful: there was little chance of any one pa&s;&s;ing that way, it being &s;o near the abbey; and he &s;eemed to be in &s;uch a &s;tate that he could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;urvive many hours.</P>
<P>"Providentially, however, after a con&s;iderable length of time, a pea&s;ant ventured into the path, after a &s;trayed
<PB N="109" REF="035833_0285_10093F31A6DC41E8">
mule; he at fir&s;t attemped to run at the &s;ight of Ja&s;per's figure, conceiving him to be &s;omething &s;upernatural; but his feeble voice &s;oon convinced the man, who &s;tood at a little di&s;tance, that he was a mortal. He immediately came up to him; but the exertion he had u&s;ed in &s;triving to make him hear, had now rendered him &s;peechle&s;s. The poor fellow, who &s;aw and pitied him, directly ran for ano|ther man to help; and they carried him between them to the pea&s;ant's cottage. After &s;ome little time he was re|cogni&s;ed, and they &s;ent to the &s;ervants at the villa, to ac|quaint them with the accident.</P>
<P>"Proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance was procured: in about eight hours he recovered his &s;peech; but yet the phy&s;ician gave no hopes of his life. In the cour&s;e of four days his wounds appeared more favourable, and his fever con&s;iderably abat|ed, yet &s;till he continued delirious at intervals. In the cour&s;e of &s;ix more days, he recovered his &s;en&s;es entirely, and was pronounced out of danger. He now &s;at up &s;ome hours every day, and &s;eemed to gain &s;trength as fa&s;t as could be wi&s;hed; and the following week, which was the time of my return, he left his chamber, though extremely low.</P>
<P>"In this &s;tate I found him, and heard from him the events which had happened in my ab&s;ence. I leave you to judge of my feelings and my &s;ituation. There was not a doubt, in my opinion, but that the villains who robbed and &s;o cruelly u&s;ed Ja&s;per, were &s;ome of D'Ollifont's gang, who knew of his intru&s;ion in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the abbey, and determined to keep him away for &s;ome time, if not to murder him. I therefore re&s;olved, however hazardous it might be, to go to the abbey that night, though Ja&s;per was unable to accompa|ny me: this re&s;olution, I mu&s;t own, was ra&s;h: but I
<PB N="110" REF="035833_0286_10093F7877CC2248">
thought not on the danger; my pa&s;&s;ions were worked up to the highe&s;t pitch.</P>
<P>"Soon after it was dark, I repaired to the cave; nothing was altered &s;ince my la&s;t vi&s;it. I proceeded along the &s;ub|terraneous pa&s;&s;age: all was &s;ilent, and gloomy. In the &s;ame manner I a&s;cended to the room; not an article ap|peared to be moved. I ro&s;e from the trap to the&s;e apart|ments: I could hear nor &s;ee nothing; every thing &s;eemed to &s;how not a &s;oul had entered it &s;ince my&s;elf: I, at length, even began to conceive doubts whether Ja&s;per's tale did not proceed from a di&s;ordered imagination. I walked &s;lowly to the gates of the chapel; and, &s;topping a few moments, &s;huddered involuntarily at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> own ideas. The horridly de&s;olate a&s;pect of every thing around me encou|raged the di&s;mal train of thoughts that &s;truck on my mind. I &s;hook off this weakne&s;s, and walked directly to the tomb; where I was &s;oon convinced of the truth of Ja&s;per's report, by finding the trap, which an&s;wered every de&s;cription he had given me. I was, however, incapable to lift it up, and having fully &s;atisfied my&s;elf that the place was now clear, returned home.</P>
<P>"The next day, I acquainted Ja&s;per with my vi&s;it; and we both conceived there was not a &s;hadow of doubt but the unfortunate Percival Ma&s;erini had been made away with, during the illne&s;s of Ja&s;per.</P>
<P>"In the cour&s;e of a week Ja&s;per was able to attend me to the abbey, and we proceeded together to the tomb. We both exerted our &s;trength, and &s;oon opened the trap, which di&s;covered a flight of narrow &s;tone &s;teps, by which we de|&s;cended to a con&s;iderable depth, and at the bottom entered a &s;mall &s;quare cell, arched over at top. This place was en|tirely clear, nor could any &s;igns of murder be di&s;covered, till Ja&s;per (as we were leaving of it) by chance &s;tumbled
<PB N="111" REF="035833_0287_10093F338A647620">
over a dagger, clotted with blood, partly dried, and in &s;ome few places begun to ru&s;t. This I re&s;olved &s;hould for the pre&s;ent remain where it was; and, after we had performed the ceremony with the lamp in the we&s;t tower (according to my oath, which I &s;trictly adhered to) we returned, &s;hocked at our efforts being fru&s;trated, relative to di&s;covering the manner in which Percival Ma&s;erini had been treated.</P>
<P>"For about a month I was undetermined in my con|jectures on the&s;e circum&s;tances, and con&s;iderations in what manner to act. Every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of nature and ju&s;tice, however, &s;eemed to demand I &s;hould if po&s;&s;ible, make what intel|ligence I had received known, and bring D'Ollifont to ac|count, on the charge of Ja&s;per.</P>
<P>"My re&s;olution to this purpo&s;e had not been fixed above a day, when the poor fellow was taken ill with a relap&s;e of the fever that had before been cau&s;ed by his wounds; and one of the&s;e wounds which he received on the brea&s;t, and which he had taken le&s;s account of than the re&s;t, now &s;howed &s;igns of mortification. Advice from every part near was &s;ent for; but their con&s;ultations proved of no avail; for, in le&s;s than a week, I &s;aw him breathe his la&s;t, in a &s;tate of in&s;anity.</P>
<P>"Every idea of bringing D'Ollifont to ju&s;tice now va|ni&s;hed; and the death of this faithful &s;ervant preyed on my &s;pirits (which, though bad at the time of my leaving Spain, had gradually grown wor&s;e ever &s;ince) in&s;omuch that, at this period, it almo&s;t affected my &s;en&s;es at certain times. Still it was a kind of melancholy madne&s;s, which was of &s;hort duration in its intervals; and, con&s;equently, could not be di&s;covered, but by the few per&s;ons who were continually with me; and they took no notice of it, as they apprehended no ill con&s;equences from it on my beha|viour, which was neither frantic nor outrageous</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="035833_0288_10093F7C374834D8">
"Seven months elap&s;ed under the&s;e circum&s;tances; during which time I received two letters from my daugh|ter, who informed me of the tenderne&s;s and affection of her hu&s;band, of his &s;ettling his affairs as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to return with her to me in Italy (a period &s;he mo&s;t &s;in|cerely longed for) though &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it would be defer|red, on account of an addition to their party, in the per&s;on of a near relation to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"This intelligence, at two different times, gave me the mo&s;t &s;incere plea&s;ure and happine&s;s.

Alas! that glimp&s;e was &s;oon extingui&s;hed; and I arrived at the cri&s;is of my misfortunes. At the end of near five months' ex|pectation after the la&s;t letter I had received, another came from his lord&s;hip, who, in the mo&s;t &s;oothing manner, (though him&s;elf, by the appearance of his writing, nearly di&s;tracted) informed me of the death of my Lucretia, in child-birth; the infant, which was a girl, having &s;urvived.</P>

<P>"ALFRED, lord Milverne, and Matilda, venerated the grief of the hermit too much to interrupt his &s;orrow, which, after a few minutes' indulgence, he overcame, and conti|nued his narrative.</P>
<P>"This intelligence, as I before ob&s;erved, brought me to the very cri&s;is of my misfortunes; and the delirious fits I laboured under became more frequent, though not more violent. My ideas were tinctured with a kind of mi&s;an|thropy, which every day increa&s;ed, and &s;erved to encou|rage horrid thoughts that had never before gained the lea&s;t a&s;cendancy over me: and the re&s;ult of what I felt was a wi&s;h (though I &s;hrunk from it with affright) to put an end to my own exi&s;tence. But the gloom of my mind becom|ing each day more terrible, worked up every evil influence with double &s;trength. Pernicious arguments floated in my brain; they &s;eemed to &s;ay I could not do wrong in ridding my&s;elf of a burden&s;ome life. In &s;hort, in le&s;s than three months, I came to the dreadful determination of drinking poi&s;on.</P>
<P>"I had &s;een no company whatever &s;ince the la&s;t news from England, but a reverend father belonging to a neigh|bouring mona&s;tery, with whom I &s;pent &s;ome hours when perfectly collected; but I had, for the la&s;t month before I took this re&s;olution, &s;eldom even &s;een him. My heated imagination prompted me to a&s;k him to dine with me the very day I re&s;olved to commit the crime. In my victuals at that meal, I intended to mix a quantity of the poi&s;on|ous drug I had already procured. It is nece&s;&s;ary, however,
<PB N="114" REF="035833_0290_10093F7F9618A1A8">
to inform you, that, at this period, I was partly in&s;ane, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;ome degree of recollection.</P>
<P>"The day arrived; and Father Phineas, by appointment, waited on me. We began dinner, and (I even now trem|ble at the idea) before it was fini&s;hed, I executed the dread|ful project, and took, with a &s;eeming calmne&s;s, the tinctured food. I immediately turned our di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject of religion; knowing I had only a few hours to live, I wi&s;hed to be &s;atisfied in &s;ome points which my di&s;ordered intellects had latterly made me doubt.</P>
<P>"The good man an&s;wered my que&s;tions with &s;olemnity and truth. In the cour&s;e of his ob&s;ervations, he treated on &s;uicide: I involuntarily &s;huddered. With a &s;teady firmne&s;s, which I &s;hall never forget, he &s;poke on the horrid act, and the eternal puni&s;hment that awaited it. I turned pale; my lips trembled with convul&s;ive terror at the idea of what I had done, and drops of per&s;piration fell from my face. Father Phineas ob&s;erved the&s;e emotions, and inquired if I was ill. The greate&s;t alarm prevailed over his features; he gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e; but delicacy forbade him to men|tion it, for fear his conjectures &s;hould be wrong. After a few moments I bur&s;t into an agony of tears, and confe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf guilty of the deed, that would (as he had clearly ex|plained) produce everla&s;ting de&s;truction.</P>
<P>"He hardly heard the confe&s;&s;ion, but darted like light|ning from the room. In le&s;s than ten minutes he return|ed with a medicine which he had procured at a relation's of his, who re&s;ided near. I immediately took it; but there was great doubt whether it would take the wi&s;hed for effect, as I had &s;wallowed the poi&s;on &s;ome time. The ago|ny I &s;uffered, in doubtful &s;u&s;pen&s;e and horror for half an hour, could not be balanced by all my griefs put together; momentarily expecting di&s;&s;olution with no hope of forgive|ne&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="035833_0291_10093F3A2C82DDF0">
"At length I brought from my &s;tomach the dreadful poi|&s;on: the operation was violent; and, when over, I found my&s;elf unable to &s;tand; the &s;ervants were therefore inform|ed by Father Phineas, that I had &s;uddenly been taken ill. I was accordingly conveyed to my bed; nor was any one ever acquainted with the real nature of the ca&s;e, he having made an excu&s;e even in procuring the medicine.</P>
<P>"In the morning, after &s;ome hours' &s;leep, I found the good man at my bed-&s;ide; his manner was now &s;evere, and I received from him a &s;harp though affecting rebuke; when, after having joined with me in a thank&s;giving for my e&s;|cape, he departed and I remained alone the remainder of the day.</P>
<P>"An inclination which I had before imbibed at inter|vals, now a&s;&s;ailed me with redoubled force; it was a wi&s;h to retire entirely from the world, and live &s;ecluded and un|known, in the cave which led to Gra&s;ville Abbey: by this I &s;hould at once gratify my own de&s;ire and (if po&s;&s;ible) more &s;trictly adhere to my oath, which I now more and more, as my health became impaired, con&s;idered as a duty to my God.</P>
<P>"The next day I communicated the thought to father Phineas, who at fir&s;t attempted to di&s;&s;uade me from it, but at la&s;t agreed that it was a re&s;olution in &s;ome degree nece&s;&s;a|ry, as a penance for the crime I had been guilty of.

<P>"I gave it out among my hou&s;ehold, that I intended to travel again to France, on account of my health; and, if I found the climate agree with me, might perhaps continue there &s;ome years, or entirely &s;ettle for the remainder of my life.

At different times of the night he had conveyed for me various uten&s;ils and conveni|ences, to form the nece&s;&s;ary articles of life, to the cave: he likewi&s;e procured the dre&s;s, &amp;c. of a hermit; and I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my now abode, giving the whole amount that my villa and furniture &s;old for, to father Phineas, to di&s;tri|bute in charitable u&s;es, be&s;ides a very hand&s;ome pre&s;ent for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"My &s;udden departure, and the melancholy &s;tate I had &s;o long been in, was talked of for &s;ome time, after which I was partly forgotten, and &s;eldom mentioned.</P>
<P>"But it was nece&s;&s;ary ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> proceedings &s;hould not &s;top here: and, in the cour&s;e of &s;ix months, Father Phineas, (who vi&s;ited me daily) by my de&s;ire, &s;pread the report of my death at Paris, and wrote a letter to D'Ollifont, who was then in Spain, to the &s;ame purport; mentioning it was my reque&s;t, when living, that, after my decea&s;e informa|tion of it &s;hould be &s;ent him.</P>
<P>"Whether he believed the account, I know not: but it is certain he might have been convinced to the contra|ry, had he taken the trouble to &s;end and make inquiries in that city. But, conceiving&punc; I &s;uppo&s;e, that there were al|ready alarms enough concerning the abbey, to keep it free from intru&s;ion, and that the principal per&s;on to contend with him was, by his diabolical arts, no more; knowing that, even if it was &s;earched, no material proofs could be brought again&s;t him, he thought my death rather a relea&s;e than a misfortune, on account of the thorough knowledge I had of his character.</P>
<P>"But, as if Providence favoured his villany, I could not bring me to di&s;regard the oath I had taken, &s;o that his wi&s;hes &s;till continued to be fulfilled. You may, per|haps,

wonder at my &s;trict adherence to it: but you mu&s;t con&s;ider my &s;ituation; every trifle &s;welled in my imagina|tion, which had now nothing to relax it; and my ferven|cy of religion, in re&s;pect to repenting of the crime I had been guilty of in an attempt to take away my own life, every day became more violent; in&s;omuch that my horror and mi&s;ery increa&s;ed, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening, the more I thought of its fatal tendency.</P>
<P>"The good father con&s;tantly vi&s;ited me during the re|mainder of his life, and regularly brought me food; but he has now been dead twelve years. After that period I was nece&s;&s;itated to go to the public market, and upon this account took the name of Father Peter, recollecting the &s;ignature which Ja&s;per put to the letter he &s;ent to Percival Ma&s;erini. Time, and the di&s;gui&s;e I was in, totally pre|vented me from being know. I have, &s;ince my appear|ance at the town, received vi&s;its from &s;ome of the pea&s;an|try, who have been more courageous and more curious than their companions.</P>
<P>"I had now but one wi&s;h to be gratified, which was, to &s;ee lord Albourne and his child, if living. The good fa|ther had, by my de&s;ire, wrote to his lord&s;hip, &s;ome time after my retirement: but we received no an&s;wer. He wrote again; but this letter proved as fruitle&s;s as the for|mer. His illne&s;s and death prevented a third from being &s;ent: the only conjecture I could form, to make me &s;up|po&s;e both letters had mi&s;carried, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as, that, in ca&s;e of his lord&s;hip's death, I &s;hould have received an an&s;wer to them by &s;ome one inve&s;ted with the management of his affairs. Father Phineas had tran&s;mitted all my money to a very re&s;pectable relation of his in France, an eminent banker, under a feigned name; and with this gentleman was al&s;o placed my will, wherein I had bequeathed the whole of my
<PB N="118" REF="035833_0294_10093F83B27DB090">
fortune to lord Albourne and his child, if living, if not, to be divided equally among &s;ix convents in France, and a con&s;iderable &s;um to be given to the poor.</P>
<P>"Lord Albourne, his child, and the recollection of al|mo&s;t every one that had been dear to me, in a great mea|&s;ure vani&s;hed from my mind, in the &s;pace of ten years. Wholly ab&s;orbed in an enthu&s;ia&s;tic mode of living, I be|came indifferent to every thing in the world, and obtained a &s;erenity to which I had before been a &s;tranger. I kept a con&s;tant watch upon the abbey, though I did not enter it for &s;ometimes &s;ix months together: yet at the&s;e times I could &s;ee no one had intruded there &s;ince my la&s;t vi&s;it.</P>
<P>"I remained in this &s;tate for near twenty years, when, the &s;econd night, as I &s;uppo&s;e, that you were at the abbey, walking rather later than u&s;ual, meditating on the events of my pa&s;t life, which &s;eemed like a fleeting dream to my imagination, my reverie was &s;uddenly interrupted by a glare of light from one of the windows on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the building. I &s;topped involuntarily; and a kind of horror, I had long been a &s;tranger to, crept through every vein. I &s;tood &s;ome minutes, as if fixed to the earth: but, knowing I could do nothing then, I made the be&s;t of my way to the cave, though unable to &s;leep the remainder of the night, from the ideas that tormented me.</P>
<P>"In the morning I ro&s;e, hara&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. I fir&s;t determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;eek out who and what the inhabitants were, as I could more ea&s;ily find out the be&s;t methods to terrify them from it, according to my oath, which I &s;till re&s;olved &s;trictly to adhere to. I went through the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age to the room, and from thence a&s;|cended to the apartment above, the next to this, in which you were all four a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="035833_0295_10093F3EC60978A0">
"I could not perceive the features of any per&s;on, but found you had taken up your re&s;idence here only two nights. I determined to begin my operations without he&s;itation, and accordingly, the latter part of the evening of the &s;ame day, repaired to the we&s;t tower, and at mid|night, in one of the ca&s;ements, exhibited the lamp. This ceremony I performed the next night, and pa&s;&s;ed the win|dow in a manner which I was certain mu&s;t cau&s;e alarm, if I was &s;een. Having done this, I returned to my cave, with &s;carcely a doubt but I had frightened the vi&s;itors from their abode.</P>
<P>"I found my&s;elf, however, mi&s;taken; for the next morning, in the &s;ubterraneous room, I heard voices, but did not then a&s;cend to the upper apartment. I attended rather earlier than u&s;ual at night, and found you had not re|tired to re&s;t, but were at &s;upper. I placed my lamp be|low, and waited above, though unable to ob&s;erve any one, the folding doors being quite clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>"The night was &s;tormy, (you no doubt, well recollect it) and I afterwards regretted the unea&s;ine&s;s I had cau&s;ed the female part of the company. The behaviour of Mr. Ma&s;erini appeared &s;trange and boi&s;terous: in &s;hort, I im|mediately conjectured he had been drinking freely. The conception was, I believe, right; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, at that time, it gave me no high opinion of his character. In con&s;equence of this idea, I did what I &s;hould otherwi&s;e, perhaps, have omitted.</P>
<P>"On my fir&s;t entrance, I heard him call for lights. His &s;i&s;ter in vain per&s;uaded him to retire to re&s;t; he &s;wallow|ed &s;everal bumpers of wine after each other, with the avi|dity of a madman: at length he called a name which &s;truck me almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s. I uttered an exclamation of horror, which was drowned by a very loud clap of thunder that
<PB N="120" REF="035833_0296_10093F866B11F0A0">
bur&s;t over the abbey at that time. My flighty imagination, wounded by a degree of returning in&s;anity, urged me to think that the name of my daughter was mentioned to hurt my feelings; and this vague thought &s;purred me to terrify the author of it with more than u&s;ual inclination. The armour that had been thrown down by Ja&s;per at the time we were viewing the abbey with &s;ignor Ranolpho, had been gathered together, and placed in the &s;ubterraneous room. I de&s;cended, and &s;oon heard him drink to the 'old gho&s;t that inhabited the abbey;' upon which I directly pu&s;hed again&s;t the pile with all my force: it fell to the ground, and, as it did before, made a mo&s;t violent cra&s;h.</P>
<P>"I immediately a&s;cended to hear what emotions it had cau&s;ed. I heard all in confu&s;ion: every one &s;eemed by the noi&s;e to have removed from their &s;eats; upon which I immediately placed my&s;elf upon the trap, ready to &s;ink on a &s;udden, if required.</P>
<P>"Mr. Ma&s;erini uttered the name of his father&mdash;I groaned.</P>
<P>"He heard it, and declared he would find from whence it came: but &s;ome one &s;eemed to hold him. I repeated the groan.</P>
<P>"Two per&s;ons approached the folding doors; they flew open: I &s;topped ju&s;t time enough to be &s;een, and then vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>"Thus ended a night, no doubt, to you, of the greate&s;t horror and di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;to me of the keene&s;t angui&s;h and re|flection; which, weighing on my mind, prevented the refre&s;hment of &s;leep: in &s;hort, the next day I was unable to leave my bed, or take any account of the abbey.</P>
<P>"The following morning, as I was at my prayers, you all entered on me rather &s;uddenly. I, as u&s;ual, prayed for the forgivene&s;s of the &s;in I had been guilty of, in the at|tempt to deprive my&s;elf of exi&s;tence. I had an uncommon
<PB N="121" REF="035833_0297_10093F42809EA160">
oppre&s;&s;ion on my &s;pirits; and tears, which I could not &s;tifle, flowed at the recollection of events in the early part of life. I turned my head, and ob&s;erved four per&s;ons a&s;|&s;embled round, two of whom bore &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance to the picture of the late count Orlando Ma&s;erini, that, weak with indi&s;po&s;ition, and overcome by my own ideas, I fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor. Even on my recovery from this fit, I did not, I believe, rightly recover my &s;cattered &s;en&s;es. You took your leave, and promi&s;ed to vi&s;it me the next day.</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;ed you were inhabitants of the abbey, and had but little doubt of your near relation&s;hip to the family of Ma&s;erini. My very &s;oul &s;eemed to cling to you: but my oath again came to my imagination, and I dreaded even the very thought of breaking it. I con&s;idered, if I could but adhere to that, and &s;till be of &s;ervice to you, I might yet die with &s;ome degree of happine&s;s. At night, as u&s;ual, I di&s;played the light in the we&s;t tower, and afterwards re|turned to my cave.</P>
<P>"According to promi&s;e, you were with me in the morn|ing. We di&s;cour&s;ed on &s;everal &s;ubjects: Mr. Ma&s;erini mentioned Gra&s;ville Abbey: I found my&s;elf confu&s;ed, and thought I could al&s;o perceive &s;ymptoms of embarra&s;&s;ment and terror in the countenances of all. Indi&s;po&s;ition again prevented me from attending with the light in the we&s;t tower at night. In the afternoon of the next day you vi&s;ited me again, and, no doubt, well remember our conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"I advi&s;ed you not to enter the abbey. Mr. Ma&s;erini an&s;wered me rather warmly, and I found my&s;elf hurt: he immediately apologi&s;ed, and we parted. I was again, at night, nece&s;&s;itated to defer the ceremony of the light, by an unexpected event, which I &s;hall hereafter make known.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="035833_0298_10093F8A66346928">
"The next day you vi&s;ited my cave; but I was ab&s;ent on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the preceding evening. At midnight, however, I di&s;played the light in the we&s;t tower, and could plainly perceive &s;ome one move with a lantern in the court below. Suppo&s;ing by this that you were none of you then retired to re&s;t, I conceived, that, in a little time, I might venture through the apartment where you &s;lept" (turning to Matilda) "to one which I have di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the &s;tate-chamber, which contains the beavers, feathers, &amp;c. and which was formerly hung with black, to receive the corp&s;e of Orlando count Ma&s;erini, for the &s;hort interval of time before he was interred.</P>
<P>"There is a door artfully concealed on one &s;ide of Mi&s;s Ma&s;erini's bed, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;covered, on ac|count of the tape&s;try that covers it: this opening leads to a private pa&s;&s;age that communicates immediately with the &s;tairs of the we&s;t tower; for I wi&s;hed to get to the &s;tate|chamber, without appearing on the ground-floor of the ab|bey, where I naturally conceived you all were. This door I &s;oftly unclo&s;ed. I thought I heard a &s;igh, and my own feelings prompted me to an&s;wer it twice: yet I ventured further, till I &s;uppo&s;ed the reflection of my figure with the lamp was &s;een in a large pier gla&s;s directly oppo&s;ite to where I &s;tood. I heard a violent &s;hriek, and ha&s;tily retired.</P>
<P>"I knew the key of the cabinet in this room was placed by my&s;elf on the remains of a decayed column in the &s;tate|chamber. I had fixed the &s;ilver chain, which was hung to it, to a marble hand, which I found by chance among the broken ornaments that lay about the different apart|ments; the cap of the pillar, however, entirely concealed it from view. I had examined this cabinet, and knew there was money, jewels, &amp;c. in it, but never &s;aw the manu&s;cript. The only account I can give for its being concealed there
<PB N="123" REF="035833_0299_10093F455D8288F0">
is, that it mu&s;t have been found by one of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins in the abbey, who (not knowing the contents, by its being wrote, perhaps, in a different language from his own) carele&s;sly placed it in an ob&s;cure drawer of the cabinet; and was prevented, probably, from robbing the other parts of it, by the dread of count D'Ollifont's re&s;entment, or from ha&s;te in not examining any further than where he placed the pa|per. Suffice it to &s;ay, that, after Ja&s;per's death, I found the key of it in the we&s;t tower; and, taking only a &s;uperfi|cial view of what it contained, fixed it in the manner and place I have before mentioned. I wi&s;hed to put you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, that without violating my oath, I might in &s;ome re&s;pects a&s;&s;i&s;t you. It was for this purpo&s;e I was go|ing to the &s;tate-chamber, with an intention of moving it into Mr. Ma&s;erini's room. Being fully convinced that all were retired to re&s;t, I left the abbey, determining to put this &s;cheme in execution the next morning.</P>
<P>"I accordingly attended at an early hour, and walked directly to the concealed door; when, &s;topping a moment, to li&s;ten, I heard Mr. Ma&s;erini and his &s;i&s;ter in conver&s;a|tion, and found he re&s;olved to watch in the we&s;t tower that night. I, at a particular part of his ob&s;ervations, in|terrupted him, by pronouncing three times, with an ener|getic voice, 'Go!' to the inexpre&s;&s;ible horror of both.</P>
<P>"A thought now entered my imagination, that I might bring every thing relative to the abbey partly to a cri&s;is, and &s;till adhere to the vow I had made. I re&s;olved to let the key of the cabinet remain in the &s;ame place, and at night appear to Mr. Ma&s;erini, in the apartment of the we&s;t tower: conceiving that if his re&s;olution failed him in point of &s;eizing me and di&s;covering the deception, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> means to lead him to the &s;tate-chamber, and there di&s;co|ver to him the key. This, though at fir&s;t it may &s;een
<PB N="124" REF="035833_0300_10093F8CF8B9F900">
equivocal, I was certain would in no degree infringe on the general tendency of my oath.</P>
<P>"I entered the abbey at midnight, but &s;topped at lea&s;t an hour in the lower rooms of the tower, before I made my appearance in the upper one. At length, however, I a&s;|cended to it, by means of one of the &s;ame &s;ort of traps which are contrived in the upper part of the building.</P>
<P>"I &s;tood before him about a minute; but hearing &s;ome one on the &s;tair-ca&s;e, immediately, by the &s;ame means, va|ni&s;hed from his &s;ight.</P>
<P>"My &s;cheme, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, being fru&s;trated, I made the be&s;t of my way to the &s;tate-chamber, through the private pa&s;&s;age I have before mentioned: wi&s;hing to regain the key of the cabinet, I wanted more light than my lamp, and accordingly lighted tho&s;e tapers that were placed in the different gla&s;&s;es. I had no &s;ooner done this, than I heard &s;ome foot&s;teps approach the door: I immediately concealed my&s;elf behind the column that contained what I have before mentioned. The voices, I found, were tho&s;e of the inhabitants of the abbey. The night was exceed|ingly &s;tormy; and a kind of &s;hock, &s;imilar to that of an earthquake, &s;eemed to take effect on the room where we &s;tood. I availed my&s;elf of this circum&s;tance, and immedi|ately pu&s;hed the cap of the column down, which directly di&s;covered the marble hand, and key &s;u&s;pended from it. Mr. Ma&s;erini by the&s;e means procured it. I then came forward and &s;tood on the trap, cla&s;ped my hands with ec|&s;ta&s;y, and de&s;cended through the floor.</P>
<P>"The next morning you all vi&s;ited me: I was looking over &s;ome papers, of infinite con&s;equence to your welfare; but it was not then a time for di&s;covery. I was, if you recollect, &s;uddenly taken ill, with a kind of fit I have for years been &s;ubject to: I prayed that my life might be pro|longed

till a mighty work was effected, which was to pro|cure ju&s;tice for the murder of Percival Ma&s;erini, and re|&s;tore his children to their rights.</P>
<P>"I had no doubt but Mr. Ma&s;erini would again watch in the we&s;t tower that night; and I accordingly appeared there in the &s;ame manner as before. His behaviour an&s;wer|ed my purpo&s;e; he &s;eized me, and di&s;covered my per&s;on: &s;ecre&s;y, in my ideas, was now at an end: an explanation took place: I, however, put off a regular detail of events till another period, but gave him hopes of once more be|ing re&s;tored to the world and happine&s;s, in a manner that would at once wipe off every &s;tigma that had &s;o long de|famed his character.</P>
<P>"He vi&s;ited me the next afternoon, but did not &s;top long, and only received from me further proofs that I had power and will to &s;erve him. I received another vi&s;it from mi&s;s Ma&s;erini alone, at midnight. My &s;urpri&s;e may well be conceived: the interview was occa&s;ioned by her finding of the manu&s;cript. I promi&s;ed to wait on her in the morning, and explain every circum&s;tance, as far as I was capable. This promi&s;e I have now fulfilled, by rela|ting every principal event of my pa&s;t life, which has been chequered with &s;cenes of happine&s;s contra&s;ted with tho&s;e of the mo&s;t poignant mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s."</P>

<P>A total incon&s;i&s;tency of conduct, however, may be ob|&s;erved through the latter part of his life, occa&s;ioned, mo&s;t probably, by a nervous con&s;titution, entirely broken by adver&s;ity; for it was certainly &s;trange that a man of en|lightened under&s;tanding, and refined education, &s;hould &s;o clo&s;ely adhere to an oath, tyrannically (as it may be &s;aid)

<P>THE mi&s;t of doubtful horror, which had &s;o long brooded over the apartments of Gra&s;ville Abbey, was now totally di&s;per&s;ed, and the gloom of &s;uper&s;titious weakne&s;s di&s;pelled by the bright ray of truth and rea&s;on. The inhabitants, in &s;ome degree, wondered at the fears that had a&s;&s;ailed them; and could not, even for a moment, reflect on them, but with a mixture of contempt and vexation at their want of fortitude to with&s;tand the &s;hock of mere vi&s;ionary terrors.</P>
<P>The baron Sampieno received the united thanks of the whole company for his recital; Matilda and Agnes drop|ped a tear at the misfortunes of the venerable orator. A &s;en&s;ation, however, they had long been &s;trangers to, of de|light and comfort, ran through the whole a&s;&s;embly. Every my&s;tery, every &s;upernatural idea, was elucidated to their &s;atisfaction, and at once relieved them from that load of anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s they had &s;o long encouraged by gloomy
<PB N="127" REF="035833_0303_10093F49D1DC28A8">
apprehen&s;ions. In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation, Matilda al&s;o under&s;tood that the an&s;wer &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to be given to her thoughts the night before, as &s;he entered the cave, was nothing more than an involuntary exclamation of the hermit's which (by the con&s;truction of the place) echoed to the part where &s;he &s;tood, in a kind of whi&s;per.</P>
<P>After having taken &s;ome refre&s;hments, lord Milverne de|clared his intention of &s;etting off to the re&s;idence of the magi&s;trate, as the critical &s;ituation of Felix demanded that the banditti &s;hould be immediately apprehended. It was re&s;olved that Leonard &s;hould attend him, as, in &s;ome parts of the information, he might be u&s;eful. They accordingly departed, and were not expected to return till the evening, as they would be nece&s;&s;itated to accompany the guards to the &s;pot, and afterwards be pre&s;ent at the examination.</P>
<P>The baron now began, to Alfred and his &s;i&s;ter, another narrative, which, though &s;horter, gave them nearly as much &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure as the former.</P>
<P>One night, which he mentioned, neglecting to &s;how the light in the we&s;t tower, he was, at an early hour, called by a voice that he had &s;omewhere heard, and which &s;eemed to come from the outer part of the cave. He immediately re|paired to the &s;pot, and perceived a man who&s;e counte|nance he directly knew: he was a pea&s;ant that had &s;ome|times vi&s;ited him, but who had latterly not &s;o often atten|ded, on account of the indi&s;po&s;ition of a relation. The man's features carried in them the utmo&s;t horror and af|fright, occa&s;ioned by three cau&s;es: fir&s;t, his relation was dying, as he &s;uppo&s;ed; &s;econdly, though he had often called upon the hermit by day-light, he had never before ventured near his habitation after dark, on account of the path leading directly to the abbey, con&s;equently was under con&s;iderable alarm; and, thirdly, that alarm was heighten|ed
<PB N="128" REF="035833_0304_10093F911907CA88">
beyond mea&s;ure, by &s;eeing a light in one of the ca&s;e|ments of that building, which occa&s;ioned his calling on the hermit's name, being unable to proceed any further.</P>
<P>With breathle&s;s agitation the poor fellow related what he had &s;een, and then reque&s;ted Father Peter would ac|company him to his cot, as he was woefully afraid &s;ome|thing lay heavy on the mind of the &s;ick man that was there, who had expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to &s;ee a confe&s;&s;or: none, however, being there to be found, he thought of Father Peter, and had even ventured, at that hour, to procure him.</P>
<P>The baron, after &s;ome he&s;itation, con&s;ented to go with him; and they accordingly walked to this man's home, where he was conducted to a room, in which, on a mi&s;er|able, bed, lay an emaciated figure extended, and &s;eemingly in the la&s;t &s;tate of con&s;umption. His face was of a deadly palene&s;s; his cheeks, &s;unk to the very bone, were covered with a &s;hrivelled &s;kin; while tho&s;e parts of his eyes which had once been white were turned to a kind of pale yellow: his no&s;e and mouth, which had been no bad features, now appeared predominant ones, owing to the thinne&s;s of his face; while in his whole per&s;on was painted angui&s;h and remor&s;e in the extreme, and a gloom at intervals, which &s;howed all joy, all hope, had for&s;aken his &s;oul. What were the &s;en&s;ations of the baron, when this change, great as it was, did not prevent him from recogni&s;ing the wretch Eburne! Ah! and what were the &s;en&s;ations of that E|burne, when he beheld and recollected, under the garb of a hermit, the much-injured baron Sampieno! He &s;hrieked aloud, and hid his face below the bed-clothes. The cotta|gers were a&s;toni&s;hed: the baron de&s;ired they would leave the room; which they accordingly did.</P>
<P>After a few minutes, hearing every thing quiet, the wretched man rai&s;ed him&s;elf; but the delirious fit he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="129" REF="035833_0305_10093F4DA73A1D40">
laboured under for &s;ome days before, now returned with violence. His black &s;haggy hair, di&s;compo&s;ed by the ef|forts he had made to hide from his &s;ight the figure before him, gave a double horror to his gha&s;tly looks, which car|ried in them every appearance of in&s;anity. He raved, cal|led on the names of count Ma&s;erini and his children&mdash;then the baron Sampieno&mdash;wept, and, clenching his hands to|gether, &s;unk on the bed, exhau&s;ted and fatigued. The ba|ron well knew it was u&s;ele&s;s to attempt to &s;peak while this fit of a guilty con&s;cience remained: he was therefore a &s;i|lent &s;pectator of the &s;cence, and greatly affected.</P>
<P>After the violent ravings of Eburne had cea&s;ed, he lay panting on the bed, with his eyes fixed on a vacant part of the chamber. The baron conceived this would be a good opportunity to addre&s;s him: he therefore drew near the bed; but Eburne again &s;hrunk from him, and put out his hand, as if &s;truck with horror at his approach. The good man &s;poke in the milde&s;t terms, and begged he would be compo&s;ed: again the langui&s;hing eyes of the culprit were rai&s;ed towards the venerable comforter; and again he &s;hrunk back, as if the figure brought to his mind ideas that rent his very &s;oul.</P>
<P>Two hours elap&s;ed, during which time the baron ad|dre&s;&s;ed him on &s;everal topics relative to religion; and his di&s;ordered intellects gradually became more connected and regular, though he, almo&s;t every five minutes, gave a con|vul&s;ive &s;hudder, and a loud &s;igh of angui&s;h and regret.</P>
<P>At length the baron promi&s;ed to call on him the next day, and left the chamber. He de&s;ired the cottager not to di&s;turb his relation; but, at day-break, to &s;end for the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;ician they could procure; and he would make up to them the expen&s;e. With many thanks, they promi&s;ed to do as he de&s;ired. He accordingly left the cot|tage;
<PB N="130" REF="035833_0306_10093F93CD718B28">
and, it being con&s;iderably pa&s;t the time of illumi|nating the tower, immediately on his return to to the cave, retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>The remainder of the night was &s;pent in a train of me|lancholy reflections on this &s;trange accident. The &s;ight of this man brought to his mind tho&s;e &s;cenes of felicity and happine&s;s which he and his diabolical ma&s;ter had forever bla&s;ted: yet, after the &s;tate in which he had beheld the mi&s;erable wretch, pity, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e reflections, entered his bo&s;om; and tho&s;e very &s;cenes, as they more confirmed his wickedne&s;s, &s;eemed to draw from the bene|volent heart of the baron greater concern and &s;orrow for his dreadful &s;ituation. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, if Eburne &s;urvived till morning (which &s;eemed rather doubtful) that he &s;hould be got into as compo&s;ed a &s;tate as po&s;&s;ible, and that by per&s;ua&s;ion (if per&s;ua&s;ion &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary) he &s;hould do what ju&s;tice he could to the offspring of that family which he mo&s;t probably had aided to de&s;troy. The baron con&s;idered that he might be acquainted with the whole of D'Ollifont's tran&s;actions; if, therefore, he could he brought to give an explanation of them, his words might be taken down in writing; and &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion (if it could be proved by re&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es who could an&s;wer for his being in a &s;tate of &s;anity) would nearly tend to an&s;wer every wi&s;hed-for purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Such were the baron's thoughts; and at an early hour he repaired to the cottage. A phy&s;ician of &s;ome eminence was already arrived: he gave but little hopes of the pa|tient, but &s;aid he might probably &s;urvive a few days. E|burne had enjoyed con&s;iderable &s;leep for &s;ome hours, and &s;eemed perfectly calm. The phy&s;ician departed, after promi&s;ing to call again in the evening.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="035833_0307_10093F4F2CAEEB48">
The baron now took the man who belonged to the cot|tage, on one &s;ide, and reque&s;ted to know what relation E|burne was to him. The man an&s;wered, he was a cou&s;in of his wife's; they had always under&s;tood he led a very wick|ed life; nor had any acquaintance been kept up between them for many years, till about &s;ix months pa&s;t, when he came to their cottage, very much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in mind, and labouring under every &s;ymptom of a decline. He fully confe&s;&s;ed to them that he had been a mo&s;t abandoned cha|racter, and claimed their pity. The cottager and his wife accordingly admitted him into their hou&s;e; but, as his health gradually grew wor&s;e, his melancholy increa&s;ed. He, however, made his will, and left them the whole of the little property he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>"La&s;t night," continued the man, "he was &s;uddenly taken much wor&s;e than we had ever before &s;een him (though he has at times been deranged in his intellects for &s;ome days pa&s;t) and begged I would bring him a confe&s;&s;or: I accordingly &s;et off for Father Leolin; but I found he was &s;ome miles from Montferrat. I then thought your pre|&s;ence would an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e."</P>
<P>The baron de&s;ired the cottager to go into the chamber of the &s;ick man, and mildly inform him that Father Peter had called to &s;ee him; that he would give him no unea&s;i|ne&s;s, but rather comfort and con&s;olation.</P>
<P>The man did as he was de&s;ired, and in about five mi|nutes returned. "Eburne," &s;aid, he, "is perfectly &s;en&s;ible, and wi&s;hes to &s;ee you: but I am &s;ure there is &s;omething &s;trange about him; for, when I only mentioned your name, he &s;tarted, as if afraid of being murdered."</P>
<P>The baron entered the room alone. Eburne again con|vul&s;ively &s;hook at the &s;ight of him; but, being addre&s;&s;ed by the mild and condoling voice of the vi&s;itor, he &s;o far re|covered
<PB N="132" REF="035833_0308_10093F9666EA2498">
as to look on him, and li&s;ten to what he &s;aid, with|out any violent emotions.</P>
<P>The baron, after an hour's conver&s;ation with him, which &s;eemed entirely to compo&s;e his mind, conceived he might venture on a topic it was before impo&s;&s;ible for him to men|tion, concerning the murder of Percival Ma&s;erini, and al&s;o of tho&s;e doubts, relative to the count his father. He opened the &s;ubject with &s;uch caution and mildne&s;s, that, though the remembrance might be &s;een to work in every feature of Eburne's face, he did not fall into any fits of in|&s;anity, but continued perfectly collected during the whole of the interrogation.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of it, he heaved a &s;igh of the mo&s;t acute an|gui&s;h and horror, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure relieved his bur&s;ting &s;oul by a flood of tears. At length he recovered &s;o far as to &s;peak, and declared that Orlando count Ma&s;erini was poi|&s;oned; and that Percival Ma&s;erini, his &s;on, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inat|ed in Gra&s;ville Abbey, after having been kept there a pri|&s;oner &s;ome little time: "and however," &s;aid he, "I may break the oath I have taken, I can no longer conceal the murderer: it was my late ma&s;ter, the count D'Ollifont. But," continued the unhappy man, "I am equally culpa|ble with him. I was privy to both tran&s;actions, and to every plot of villany he was concerned in, particularly that by which you were &s;o great a &s;ufferer. Oh, my God!" he exclaimed, cla&s;ping his hands in agony, "thou only knowe&s;t what are my &s;ufferings. It is thou only can&s;t con|ceive the pangs which drive me to madne&s;s."</P>
<P>He was near fainting: but the baron admini&s;tered a cor|dial, which &s;oon recovered him. He now informed Eburne that there was one e&s;&s;ential way of atoning for his guilt; and that was to do ju&s;tice to the de&s;cendants of the decea&s;|ed; for this purpo&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary, as his wife was uncer|tain,
<PB N="133" REF="035833_0309_10093F51C6493120">
that a paper &s;hould be drawn up, declaring the facts relative to both murders, which in a court of ju&s;tice would be certain to cru&s;h the wretch that was the cau&s;e of them, and give to the children of the injured tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they had &s;o long unlawfully been deprived of. Eburne gladly and immediately con&s;ented to the propo&s;al, and the more particularly &s;o, when it was explained to him that the breaking of an oath in &s;uch a ca&s;e could not be deemed an act of wickedne&s;s, or be di&s;approved of by the Supreme. The baron then drew up a paper containing all the cir|cum&s;tances which were related to him by Eburne, before Father Leolin, who was now arrived, and acquainted with the affair.</P>
<P>In the evening the phy&s;ician arrived; and before him and the cottager, Eburne &s;igned the paper; declaring it on oath to be the truth of every tran&s;action it contained. E|burne &s;eemed con&s;iderably better, and after &s;ome little time the whole company departed; the baron taking po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the paper, which was the &s;ame he was looking over when vi&s;ited by the inhabitants of the abbey.</P>
<P>The confe&s;&s;ion it held forth was partly as follows:&mdash;That he was taken into the &s;ervice of D'Ollifont when very young, &s;hortly after that gentleman commenced gam|bler in Spain. He was &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed as his confiden|tial &s;ervant, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in mo&s;t of his defrauds&mdash;that they led that kind of life till his ma&s;ter's character was well known in tho&s;e parts, where he re&s;ided for &s;ome time&mdash;that they were nece&s;&s;itated to fly to the place where the baron Sampieno and his family re&s;ided, and, knowing his riches, determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to make him a dupe to their artifice; in&s;inuating him&s;elf into the baron's family, though he bore a deadly hatred to that nobleman: This hatred he re&s;olved to gratify by a diabolical &s;cheme of ma|lice
<PB N="134" REF="035833_0310_10093F9AA289E370">
and villany. He determined to take away by force Lucretia, the baron's only daughter; and, by ruining her honour, to make a public di&s;grace and ignominy fall upon her father, which he knew would more effectually bla&s;t his happine&s;s than any pecuniary fraud he could invent. This &s;cheme was fru&s;trated by the baron's over-hearing a conver&s;ation which he and his ma&s;ter had on that &s;ubject; but which gave ri&s;e to another opportunity for D'Ollifont to execute a &s;econd fiend-like contrivance, which tended to the &s;ame horrid purpo&s;e, and which, if po&s;&s;ible, exceed|ed the former one in ingenuity and contrivance.</P>
<P>The manner and i&s;&s;ue of this horrid plot again&s;t the ba|ron was related by him&s;elf, and the &s;ucce&s;s of it an&s;wered but too well.</P>
<P>Eburne confe&s;&s;ed in the te&s;timony, that he was the per|&s;on who found means to bury &s;ome of the fal&s;e notes in the baron's garden, and who, by D'Ollifont's orders, brib|ed one of his &s;ervants to their intere&s;t. He attended his ma&s;ter to Italy, where the old count Ma&s;erini was extreme|ly alarmed, on account of a report which had been &s;pread concerning his children, who had been &s;ome time in France. He had been informed that Percival, his &s;on, had contrived to rob the convent of N***** of a young lady of family and di&s;tinction, and that both, with his &s;i&s;ter, had fled.&mdash;This report &s;eemed the more to be credited, as an interval of &s;ome time had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the count had heard from them.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was extremely ill on the arrival of his nephew, but te&s;tified great plea&s;ure at &s;eeing him, hav|ing never heard of his mi&s;conduct. He &s;lowly recovered; and D'Ollifont was di&s;patched to procure &s;ome further in|telligence of his children. It was during this journey that he made Eburne acquainted with his intentions, and pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="135" REF="035833_0311_10093F228FED7BF0">
him large rewards if he &s;ucceeded. They returned to the abbey with a feigned letter, which gave information that Percival Ma&s;erini and his &s;i&s;ter were no more; that the former fell by the hand of an officer who was going to &s;ecure them, and that the latter, in a fit of in&s;anity, had poi&s;oned her&s;elf. The letter concluded with &s;aying that lady Clementina was confined in the Ba&s;tile, on a &s;u&s;picion of having murdered her &s;i&s;ter, who was found dead in her bed the morning after the elopement from the convent.</P>
<P>The grief of the count was exce&s;&s;ive, and brought on a relap&s;e of his former di&s;order; and this, added to a &s;low poi&s;on, which Eburne, procured, and which D'Ollifont mixed with every &s;mall quantity of food he partook of, put an end to his exi&s;tence, without any &s;igns of murder being committed. The count made a will about two days be|fore he died, in which he bequeathed the whole of his e&s;tates and property, except a few legacies, to his nephew. Eburne, by his ma&s;ter's order, gave it out the abbey was haunted, and, the better to make this believed, D'Ollifont him&s;elf left it &s;uddenly in the night, after the funeral of his uncle. He returned immediately to Spain, and left or|ders that nothing &s;hould be moved from the abbey.</P>
<P>Eburne, however, was left behind, though it was &s;uppo&s;|ed round the country that the abbey was entirely free from inhabitants. He each night &s;howed the light in the we&s;t tower, and &s;ecretly employed three mechanics to put the traps and machinery in order. The&s;e works he &s;uperinten|ded; and finding one of the&s;e men, who&s;e name was Enu|chio, fit for his purpo&s;e, retained him, by D'Ollifont's de|&s;ire, to re&s;ide in the &s;ubterraneous chamber, and &s;how the light, while Eburne departed for Spain, to come forward on the trial of baron Sampieno.</P>
<P>Eburne al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed that the pa&s;&s;age which formed a com|munication between the abbey and the cave, the traps, &amp;c.
<PB N="136" REF="035833_0312_10093F9D5081A5A0">
were found out by him&s;elf, and the &s;ecrets conveyed directly to his ma&s;ter, from whom he received a con&s;idera|ble pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The paper next contained an account of the terms to which the baron con&s;ented, to &s;ave the life of him&s;elf and daughter, which the reader has before been acquainted with; al&s;o an account of D'Ollifont's entering into a &s;oci|ety of depredators while in Italy, who&s;e birth and &s;ituation in life were all above the common rank, and who&s;e defrauds were carried to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable amount on people of rank. It was at one of their places of rendezvous, at Genoa, where the baron was introduced to D'Ollifont, at the time he took his oath. After that conference, the latter depart|ed to Spain; but Eburne &s;till remained concealed, as his agent in Montferrat, a watch upon the baron, and every circum&s;tance which concerned the abbey. He &s;ent him in|formation that Percival Ma&s;erini was actually arrived though, by D'Ollifont's orders, &s;everal men were placed on the roads to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him.</P>
<P>Immediately that the keys were delivered in Spain, he &s;et off from that country, and &s;ecretly arrived at Montferrat, where he kept concealed in the &s;ubterraneous room, with Eburne, Enuchio, and three men whom he had hired. It has before been mentioned that the baron was ab&s;ent many miles; which an&s;wered every wi&s;h of D'Ollifont: but he did not know that Ja&s;per was left behind. The re&s;olution of this party was, to &s;eize Percival Ma&s;erini and his &s;ervant, &s;hould they &s;earch the abbey alone; which it was rather expected they would. Enuchio and the three men were di&s;patched in the day time, about three miles round the &s;pot, each taking different roads, and met at the cave at an appointed hour at dark.</P>
<P>It was about the fifth night, when, after one of the&s;e ex|cur&s;ions, Enuchio brought word that Percival Ma&s;erini,
<PB N="137" REF="035833_0313_10093F58D82D8788">
whom he per&s;onally knew, with his &s;ervant, had ju&s;t cal|led at an inn for &s;ome refre&s;hment; and, by their manner, he judged they were coming to the abbey, as they did not &s;eem inclined to &s;top, as it was now late.</P>
<P>Every thing, therefore, was prepared; Enuchio and two of the men were planted in the we&s;t tower. Eburne and another man were concealed in the hall; and the count him&s;elf waited the i&s;&s;ue of the &s;cheme, in the tomb, in which the unhappy victim was to be &s;hut up. He entered the abbey, agreeably to their expectations, even unattend|ed by his &s;ervant; and cro&s;&s;ed the hall without any inter|ruption. Eburne being now certain he was within their power, he and his companion joined the count, while the unfortunate Percival a&s;cended to the we&s;t tower.</P>
<P>On his entrance, he was immediately &s;eized by the ruffi|ans: in the &s;truggle, a picture of his wife was torn by force from his bo&s;om, with a part of the ribbon; and &s;everal drops of blood, proceeding from a blow which he received in the face, &s;tained the floor: the&s;e were di&s;covered by Ed|ward, his man, when he made a &s;earch after his ma&s;ter in the morning; and al&s;o by &s;ignor Balvolio, the officers of ju&s;tice, and other per&s;ons who attended the abbey for the &s;ame purpo&s;e afterwards. Percival Ma&s;erini was convey|ed down to the cell de&s;cribed by the baron, and di&s;covered by Ja&s;per; and a &s;hort allowance of food was given him each night.</P>
<P>A few days after, Ja&s;per was di&s;covered to be left be|hind in Montferrat; and it was determined he &s;hould be made away with, or at lea&s;t &s;o far hurt as to prevent any interruption from him. Eburne and two of the men a&s;|&s;aulted him in one of the private avenues leading to the front gates, and left him for dead.</P>
<P>The next night it was re&s;olved between Eburne and his ma&s;ter, that a period &s;hould be put to the life of their
<PB N="138" REF="035833_0314_10093F9ED96DE728">
wretched pri&s;oner, for fear of the baron's return. D'Olli|font, however, did not wi&s;h any one of the men to be privy to the actual commitment of the murder: Enuchio and the others were therefore di&s;charged with large pre&s;ents, and, by his de&s;ire, departed to Spain: there they were &s;eized, through the agency of an algua&s;il with whom he was con|nected, put a-board a &s;hip of war, and fell in the fir&s;t en|gagement.</P>
<P>At midnight D'Ollifont, with his own hand, &s;tubbed his cou&s;in Percival Ma&s;erini; Eburne being unable to per|petrate this la&s;t deed of darkne&s;s, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e a&s;&s;i&s;ted poi&s;on was at fir&s;t offered the unhappy man; but, on re|fu&s;ing to take it, he received the wound which at once re|lea&s;ed him from a wretched exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Eburne and his diabolical employer buried the body near the tomb, in a grave which had been prepared in the day; and then, placing every thing in the abbey as it was be|fore they came, departed, and in di&s;gui&s;e returned to Spain.</P>
<P>Here Eburne received a con&s;iderable &s;um from D'Olli|font, and remained in his &s;ervice about &s;ix months: when he was one night &s;uddenly &s;eized, and carr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> on hoard a &s;imilar &s;hip to that in which his companions, were convey|ed; but, fortunately, did not meet with the &s;ame fate.

<P>He was driven from France by nearing of D'Ollifont's arrival there, and cro&s;&s;ed over to England, torn with re|mor&s;e,
<PB N="139" REF="035833_0315_10093F5B836F0740">
and hara&s;&s;ed by a guilty con&s;cience. He was often tempted, in defiance of the oath he had taken, to impeach his late ma&s;ter; but the doubt how &s;uch an accu&s;ation might be received from him, again&s;t one who was every day growing more popular in Paris, prevented this act of ju&s;tice. He re&s;ided in England &s;ome years, as &s;ervant to a private gentleman; but was again nece&s;&s;itated to fly, on being informed that D'Ollifont was there likewi&s;e, dread|ing the power and inclination he had to rid the world of one who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> privy to &s;o many of his crimes.

<P>To this purport was the paper which the baron now de|livered to Alfred Ma&s;erini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it was a precious gift; for it would mo&s;t likely tend, with corre&s;pondent evidence, to &s;ubdue the inveterate and malicious for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their family, while it procured them that comfort and affluence which they had &s;o long been deprived of.</P>

<P>THE baron further informed them that Eburne in the cour&s;e of two days &s;o far recovered at to be able to &s;it up for &s;ome hours; but, after his confe&s;&s;ion, he &s;eemed to ex|pre&s;s &s;uch an impatience for his di&s;&s;olution, as indicated his mind was in &s;ome degree di&s;ordered; and, on the third

morning after, he was di&s;covered hanging by a cord, which he had found means to procure from a part of his bed, and fixed to a hook in the ceiling; thus adding another crime to the many that he had already committed, by an act of &s;uicide.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of this man's life held forth a &s;triking le&s;&s;on of villany and cruelty; his de&s;troying of that ex|i&s;tence which he had every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e had nearly run its cour&s;e, confirmed at once how much he &s;uffered from the horrors of a guilty con&s;cience, and the effects of a truly vicious mind.</P>
<P>As there was now no doubt but the abbey, with all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and e&s;tates belonging to it, was the &s;ole and lawful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of Alfred and his &s;i&s;ter, no &s;cruples of honour could prevent them from making u&s;e of the money and other valuables that were in the cabinet: but as the baron con&s;idered that the whole bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t go under a regular cour&s;e of in&s;pection before the government, and count D'Ollifont be brought in the face of his country to an&s;wer for tho&s;e crimes which could now be partly proved again&s;t him (though the facts did not actually amount to demon|&s;tration) they conceived it would be better to let every article remain in the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>The baron in&s;i&s;ted on their receiving from him &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary for their pre&s;ent demands. It was, he &s;aid, his intention, if po&s;&s;ible, publicly to clear that part of his character, which had for &s;o many years remained under the a&s;per&s;ions of a villain; and bring his accu&s;ations again&s;t D'Ollifont on the foundation of Eburne's manu&s;cript, which explained events relative to that affair with as much accuracy as it did the circum&s;tances re&s;pecting count Ma&s;e|rini and his children.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="035833_0317_10093F5D0A81BE38">
The baron wrote to his banker in Paris, who was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of his property, for remittances; giving him notice, at the &s;ame time, that he &s;hould &s;hortly appear in per&s;on, to demand the whole of his fortune. The old gentleman con&s;ented to the entreaties of Alfred and his &s;i&s;ter to re|main in the abbey, as they could ea&s;ily have a bed made up for him in a chamber next to Alfred's.</P>
<P>In the latter part of the day, lord Milverne returned with Leonard and Felix: his lord&s;hip informed them that the banditti were taken, the men who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him were &s;ingled out, relea&s;ed, and received from him a hand&s;ome reward, while the others were re&s;erved for a public trial. Lord Milverne had &s;poken to the magi&s;trate (who&s;e polite|ne&s;s was extreme) concerning Alfred Ma&s;erini's affairs; he appointed to &s;ee him, with his lord&s;hip, the next morning, and promi&s;ed to take every method in his power, to reco|ver for them their ju&s;t and lawful right.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip was much &s;urpri&s;ed and plea&s;ed to hear the account of Eburne, and the manu&s;cript they had got in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He congratulated them on the hopes of a very &s;peedy end to their misfortunes: nor was the baron le&s;s plea&s;ed to hear that his &s;on-in-law lord Albourne, and the daughter of his one beloved Lucretia, were both known to Alfred and Matilda. Plea&s;ure beamed in his counte|nance, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> former &s;poke of her with the rapturous prai&s;es of a lover.</P>
<P>Leonard on his return was di&s;patched with the letter.&mdash;In it the baron reque&s;ted of his banker to remit him the &s;un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for which he wrote by the &s;peedie&s;t conveyance. Lord Milverne partook of Alfred's bed; another was made up for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he baron, and a third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> below for Leonard and Felix.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="035833_0318_10093FA715FE8DE0">
The happy party a&s;&s;embled at breakfa&s;t at an early hour the next morning; after which they employed them&s;elves in taking a regular &s;urvey of the abbey; and the baron ex|plained to them tho&s;e pieces of mechani&s;m it contained, which now fully accounted for the &s;trange things they had been witne&s;s to. They al&s;o de&s;cended to the &s;ubterrane|ous room, and from thence walked to the cave, from which all the articles that the baron wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve, were carri|ed to the abbey by Leonard and Felix.</P>
<P>Alfred, lord Milverne and the baron now &s;et off for the magi&s;trate, attended by Leonard. Matilda and Agnes dined alone: and though the latter would &s;ometimes &s;ur|vey the gothic &s;tructure of the room, it was with that de|gree of plea&s;ure and confidence, which confirmed how well &s;he was &s;atisfied that every fear &s;he had before encouraged was groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>"I am now, mademoi&s;elle," &s;aid &s;he to Matilda, "hap|py indeed; and I may truly &s;ay that this happine&s;s is in|crea&s;ed by &s;eeing all around me &s;o: in &s;hort, I know no|thing that could add to my pre&s;ent felicity, but...." Here &s;he &s;tammered; the blu&s;h of true innocence glowed on her cheek, and heightened that plea&s;ing &s;implicity which grac|ed every feature.</P>
<P>Matilda gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e of this embarra&s;&s;ment, and archly reminded her of Oliver.</P>
<P>The poor girl bur&s;t into tears&mdash;</P>
<P>"Indeed, mademoi&s;elle, though I own I love Oliver, yet even the pre&s;ence of my poor mother, however &s;he may in &s;ome re&s;pects have treated me, would add to my pre&s;ent joy."</P>
<P>Matilda was &s;truck with her gratitude, and commen|ded it.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="035833_0319_10093F5F9DFA3990">
"Both your wi&s;hes, Agnes," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;hall, if in my power, be gratified. Your mother &s;hall be reconciled to your marriage with Oliver, by my making him a pre&s;ent that &s;hall give him importance enough to gain her good will."</P>
<P>"A thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings on you, mademoi&s;elle! I know not how to thank you, unle&s;s you will look on the&s;e tears as in &s;ome degree an acknowledgment for your goodne&s;s."</P>
<P>Felix now entered the room to take away the dinner things; which put an end to the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The latter part of the day, Alfred and his friends return|ed. They brought with them two Italian women &s;ervants. One of the lower apartments was fixed for their kitchen, and they &s;lept in a &s;mall room next to Matilda's chamber. The magi&s;trate had given them every hope of a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue to their cau&s;e. By their orders he was the next day to &s;end off an arre&s;t again&s;t count D'Ollifont, to detain his per&s;on wherever found, on three &s;everal charges&mdash;fir&s;t, for the mur|der of his uncle the count Orlando Ma&s;erini&mdash;&s;econd, for the murder of his cou&s;in Percival Ma&s;erini and unlawfully detaining the property of his heirs to his own u&s;e.</P>
<P>The third charge was in the name of the baron Sampie|no, for fal&s;e accu&s;ations, and defamation of character.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trate informed them that the count's power in France was no more: he had offended the royal party by an attempt to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate one of their cla&s;s, and in &s;hort was in every re&s;pect no more than a pri&s;oner in the country, be|ing afraid to leave it, though by no means wi&s;hing to re|main there.</P>
<P>This gentleman's politene&s;s was extreme: he offered the &s;ervices of him&s;elf and lady to introduce them into pub|lic, under their proper names; which was now in many re&s;pects ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The next day was appoin|ted
<PB N="144" REF="035833_0320_10093FA8A0139FC8">
for Matilda to vi&s;it them. The fore part of the follow|ing morning the baron propo&s;ed a walk to the cottage of Eburne's relations, as he conceived both Alfred and Matil|da &s;hould be made known to them, as well as to the phy|&s;ician and father Leolin. They accordingly vi&s;ited tho&s;e per&s;ons; and all of them declared their readine&s;s to come forward in their behalf.</P>
<P>After this walk they &s;et off for &s;ignor Salvarino's, the magi&s;trate's. Agnes, however, declined the invitation to attend them, as it was her intention to &s;ee &s;ome things put in order by the &s;ervants, nece&s;&s;ary for the reception of a large party, which Alfred had re&s;olved to entertain before he left the abbey.</P>
<P>They were received by &s;ignor Salvarino and his lady with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s; &s;ome of the principal per&s;ons of the place were a&s;&s;embled, purpo&s;ely to be introduced to the ba|ron and the young reclu&s;es; and all te&s;tified their joy that the right heirs of the Ma&s;erini family were now likely to be re&s;tored to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their ance&s;tors. Alfred was informed that di&s;patches again&s;t D'Ollifont were already &s;ent off, and a regular proce&s;s in their behalf commenced again&s;t him. In the evening they attended a public place of entertainment, and received con&s;iderable applau&s;e from the audience; for their &s;tory had already &s;pread through the principal part of Montferrat.</P>
<P>The following day was fixed on by &s;ignor Salvarino, the baron, and Alfred, for the &s;ettlement of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary cir|cum&s;tances relative to the &s;uit in hand. He waited on them at the abbey, and was taken all over it. Every con|trivance was explained to him; and he &s;howed the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment at what he &s;aw. The remainder of the day was dedicated clo&s;ely to bu&s;ine&s;s. Lord Milverne was ab&s;ent on &s;ome of his own affairs. In the evening &s;ignor
<PB N="145" REF="035833_0321_10093F63B238FEA0">
Salvarino took his leave, with an invitation to him&s;elf and lady, with mo&s;t of the per&s;ons who were pre&s;ent at his hou&s;e, to &s;pend the next day at the abbey. The whole party accordingly met at the dinner hour: they &s;urveyed the building, and received an elucidation to every my&s;tery. Agnes undertook to manage the entertainment; and it was conducted in a manner that did her infinite credit.</P>
<P>They now began to make preparations for leaving Italy, as their pre&s;ence would &s;hortly be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in France. It was agreed that lord Milverne &s;hould cro&s;s over from that country to England, as he had &s;ome con|cerns to &s;ettle; and, at the &s;ame time, make inquiries if lord Albourne and his daughter were in London, as they all conceived it probable he might return immediately after the accident of the fire at the inn. Signor Salvarino procured them an elderly man and woman to look after the abbey, and re&s;ide there in their ab&s;ence; and in the cour&s;e of a fortnight they &s;et off on their journey, with the two Italian &s;ervants whom they had hired.</P>
<P>Before their departure the baron received the &s;um he had wrote for from his banker, with a polite invitation to his hou&s;e on their arrival at Paris. They had al&s;o information that the arre&s;t was executed again&s;t count D'Ollifont, and that he was now a pri&s;oner in his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>They travelled &s;lowly, and arrived in France without any particular accident. They engaged hand&s;ome apartments. Lord Milverne remained with them but three days, and then tore him&s;elf from the happy party; not, however, without obtaining a promi&s;e from Matilda, to become his immediately on his return. They al&s;o under&s;tood that D'Ollifont had been confined to his bed &s;ome time, and had totally lo&s;t the royal favour. Since his arre&s;t he had often &s;hown fits of in&s;anity; and it was doubted by the
<PB N="146" REF="035833_0322_10093FABB91C3D40">
phy&s;ician whether he would &s;urvive to take his trial. Signor Salvarino had given them letters of introduction to many per&s;ons of fa&s;hion and di&s;tinction in France; and tho&s;e, added to their being known before, procured them admittance to the fir&s;t parties.</P>
<P>Before their arrival, they were informed that the charge again&s;t Alfred was re&s;cinded, even previous to the arre&s;t again&s;t D'Ollifont. They vi&s;ited the baron's banker, who introduced them to the whole of his friends.</P>
<P>They had been in Paris about a week, when they one evening attended the theatre: in leaving of it, as they pa&s;|&s;ed through one of the pa&s;&s;ages, a gentleman before them, &s;eemingly intoxicated in a &s;mall degree, was addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to a young lady rather again&s;t her will, though per|&s;onally he appeared to be known to her. She had an el|derly lady with her: they were, however, before Alfred and the baron; con&s;equently, their faces could not be ob|&s;erved.</P>
<P>His importunities at length &s;eemed to become exceeding di&s;agreeable, and his remarks carried in them &s;ome impro|priety. Alfred advanced, and declared the lady &s;hould not by in&s;ulted! The gentleman turned round, and ex|claimed with the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, "Mr. Ma&s;erini!" no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was Alfred's a&s;toni&s;hment le&s;s to behold Henry Peviquil. The young lady turned pale at the name of Ma&s;erini, and &s;at down on a &s;eat near; which gave Alfred an opportuni|ty to recogni&s;e lady Caroline Albourne, and the baron the picture of his departed wife and daughter, in the per&s;on of his grandchild.</P>
<P>Alfred, di&s;engaging him&s;elf from the levity of Peviquil ran to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but, before he could catch her in his arms, &s;he had fainted in tho&s;e of the lady who was with her, and who was totally unknown to both Alfred and his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="035833_0323_10093F66B5A809C8">
The baron and Matilda now advanced. The former cla&s;ped the hand of the inanimate yet beautiful form, with ec&s;ta&s;y; but that ec&s;ta&s;y cau&s;ed a tear to flow at the re|collection of her mother. A con&s;iderable crowd of per&s;ons were now a&s;&s;embled round: a gentleman, who &s;tood by, invited them into a room in the interior part of the theatre; which offer they gladly accepted. Henry Peviquil, eleva|ted with wine, yet haggard with di&s;&s;ipation, attempted to follow: but Alfred politely reque&s;ted he would de&s;i&s;t: this he at la&s;t agreed to; but reque&s;ted his addre&s;s, that he might call and congratulate him on his return to France.&mdash;They accordingly exchanged cards, and he directly left the place.</P>
<P>Matilda privately entreated the baron that he would not di&s;cover him&s;elf to lady Caroline that night, as the pre|&s;ent alarm had &s;o greatly overcome her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Alfred hung over the charming invalid with a mixture of joy and concern. Her countenance was much altered &s;ince he had la&s;t &s;een her: though her beauty was not greatly dimini&s;hed, yet it was of that delicate and langui&s;h|ing kind which plainly told &s;he had &s;uffered the mo&s;t heart|felt and poignant unea&s;ine&s;s. He knew, from Caroline Albourne's &s;incere and artle&s;s conduct, that &s;he once loved him; but he al&s;o knew his character had &s;uffered the &s;ever|e&s;t &s;hock in the opinion of her father. She might now be the wife of another! The thought no &s;ooner darted on his brain, than its effects might be ob&s;erved in every feature. Lady Caroline recovered, and looked round with &s;ome &s;ur|pri&s;e on the little party near her. She cla&s;ped the offered hand of Matilda with plea&s;ure: and her eyes &s;poke to|wards Alfred, more than &s;he dared to utter.</P>
<P>She had accompanied her father, after the accident of the fire, into Italy; but remained there a very &s;hort time.
<PB N="148" REF="035833_0324_10093FAD4FCD74B8">
They then returned to France, as his lord&s;hip conceived the climate to agree with his con&s;titution, which &s;till &s;eem|ed on the decline. The elderly lady, who was with her, had re&s;ided in France all her life, and was a di&s;tant relation of lord Albourne's, at who&s;e hou&s;e his lord&s;hip now re&s;ided with his daughter. They had heard of Alfred's arrival at Paris, with the information that the charge again&s;t him was withdrawn, and another of a very high and criminal nature brought by him again&s;t D'Ollifont. But lord Al|bourne was now by no means &s;atisfied with that part of his character which he had formerly been a witne&s;s to, in point of gambling: nor did he give his daughter the lea&s;t hopes of a favourable alteration in his &s;entiments towards the young Frenchman. Alfred wi&s;hed them to permit him to attend them home; but this was ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, as they had their vi&s;itors and two &s;ervants in waiting.</P>
<P>Alfred, therefore, had only the con&s;olation of finding that &s;he was &s;till unmarried, and declaring, as he handed her to the carriage, that in a very &s;hort time the whole of his con|duct would, he hoped, be explained to lord Albourne &s;atis|factorily, and him&s;elf made the happie&s;t of men, by being permitted to &s;olicit of her that, the very thought of which had &s;upported him through every misfortune.</P>
<P>The baron reque&s;ted of the old lady his lord&s;hip's ad|dre&s;s, having bu&s;ine&s;s, as he informed her, of great impor|tance with him the following day; and, after a rather con|fu&s;ed farewell, the whole company parted with &s;till more confu&s;ed ideas.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SENSATIONS of plea&s;ure oft-times produce a train of reflections that bring with them the recollection of pa&s;t &s;cenes of happine&s;s, and pre&s;ent to us former objects in which our very &s;oul appeared entwined in one common ex|i&s;tence, and the parting of which &s;eems almo&s;t to &s;eparate our&s;elves.</P>
<P>So it was with the baron Sampieno, at the &s;ight of lady Caroline. He felt that enthu&s;ia&s;tic glow of rapture which &s;wells the veins of a parent at the recovery of a long-lo&s;t and beloved child; but reflection &s;oon whi&s;pered that &s;he was neither that beloved daughter nor wife who&s;e figure &s;till floated in his brain. Every feature, every look of each of them, &s;hone forth in the beautiful repre&s;entative he had &s;een; and the idea of what they were followed, and cal|led up tho&s;e trivial &s;cenes of endearment, which opened wounds that for a time had been healed by the balm of a re|ligious frenzy.</P>
<P>Immediately on his return home, he apologi&s;ed to Alfred and Matilda, hurried to his chamber, and gave vent to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions he had &s;truggled to conceal. The baron was po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of a degree of fortitude by no means incon&s;iderable: he had courage and re&s;olution, a refined education and un|der&s;tanding and a noble heart. Yet there was a con&s;titu|tional weakne&s;s, a &s;omething in his di&s;po&s;ition, which, by
<PB N="150" REF="035833_0326_100937DB92B8D4D8">
the generality of mankind, might be called a womani&s;h de|fect, but by others would be looked upon as one of the ex|cellencies of human nature. The regret, however, for the lo&s;s of his wife and daughter, did not le&s;&s;en the tie which drew him towards his grandchild: he &s;uffered that which can only be conceived by a per&s;on in a &s;imilar &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Alfred and his &s;i&s;ter met him the next morning at break|fa&s;t. His countenance was &s;erene, yet melancholy: &s;till, however, they could perceive he anticipated the plea&s;ure of cla&s;ping lady Caroline to his heart, and once more em|bracing his much beloved &s;on-in-law.</P>
<P>Alfred, though he might wi&s;h to accompany him, imme|diately refu&s;ed the invitation; but the baron reque&s;ted that Matilda would go with them.</P>
<P>At rather an early hour, they were introduced by ma|dame Bo&s;ivi's &s;ervant to the breakfa&s;t-room, in which were &s;eated that lady, lord Albourne, and his daughter. Lady Caroline was at her harp, and his lord&s;hip li&s;tening to her harmony, while he took his chocolate. All three ro&s;e at the entrance of the vi&s;itors, and madame Bo&s;ivi introduced the baron as the gentleman whom &s;he had mentioned to his lord&s;hip the night before.</P>
<P>Lord Albourne bowed; and, though he &s;eemed rather &s;truck with the countenance, did not recogni&s;e the per&s;on: he, however, advanced, and took the hand of Matilda.</P>
<P>"Believe me, mi&s;s Ma&s;erini," &s;aid he, however, unex|pected this vi&s;it may be, the plea&s;ure I receive from it is unlimited; and I am &s;ure Caroline will join with me in thanks for the honour you confer on us."</P>
<P>Matilda bowed, and returned a &s;uitable an&s;wer to this polite compliment.</P>
<P>During a &s;hort interval the baron's eyes were fixed, fir&s;t on lord Albourne, and then on his daughter; while ma|dame
<PB N="151" REF="035833_0327_10093FD36843FBC0">
Bo&s;ivi, who was the mo&s;t di&s;engaged of the party, thought &s;he could perceive a likene&s;s between the picture of the late lady Albourne that hung over the fire-place, and the &s;tranger before her.</P>
<P>Each being &s;eated, lord Albourne, turning to the baron, reque&s;ted to know his bu&s;ine&s;s; and while this reque&s;t was made, as he more earne&s;tly ob&s;erved the features of the per&s;on to whom he was &s;peaking, they &s;eemed to make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on his memory; and a &s;omething appear|ed to cro&s;s his mind, that occa&s;ioned con&s;iderable emotion.</P>
<P>The baron he&s;itated: a kind of &s;ympathy worked upon both; and, while Matilda trembled with anxiety, lady Caroline and madame Bo&s;ivi looked at each other with the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e. The baron at length &s;poke.</P>
<P>"I will not &s;o much wrong your lord&s;hip as even &s;o &s;uppo&s;e you have forgot &s;ome &s;cenes at an early period of life; the tendency, and I may &s;ay, happine&s;s of which have, no doubt, &s;tamped on your recollection &s;ome objects to whom you were then nearly allied, and in who&s;e for|tune you were much intere&s;ted: but I am far from being &s;urpri&s;ed that my face does not call the&s;e circum&s;tances to your recollection, when I con&s;ider the alteration that time and mi&s;ery have made in my per&s;on."</P>
<P>Lord Albourne heard no more: he cla&s;ped the offered hand of the baron with an ardour that bordered on mad|ne&s;s; and, as he lifted his eyes towards heaven, he heaved a heart-felt &s;igh, which, in &s;ome degree, relieved the ful|ne&s;s of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Lady Caroline and madame Bo&s;ivi &s;till remained &s;ilent &s;pectators of this affecting &s;cene; though, with Matilda, they were rather alarmed at the &s;ituation of his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The baron received lord Albourne in his arms with a plea&s;ure that partook of paternal love. They were both
<PB N="152" REF="035833_0328_10093FB3A95FB878">
unable to &s;peak: his lord&s;hip took the hand of his daugh|ter, and pre&s;ented her to her grandfather. Another affect|ing &s;cene now took place, and the baron almo&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed he cla&s;ped the figure of his Lucretia.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time he gave them a brief account of his life &s;ince that period which he termed the cri&s;is of his misfor|tunes&mdash;his parting with his daughter.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this relation he oft-times had occa&s;ion to mention Alfred, at who&s;e name his lord&s;hip looked re|&s;erved, and lady Caroline with anxiety.</P>
<P>Though lord Albourne found him &s;o much prejudiced in his favour, he could not forget events he had been wit|ne&s;s to, which left behind them traits very injurious to his general character. In the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation they found that his lord&s;hip had never received any letter from the baron; but had for an&s;wer to inquiries which he &s;ent to Italy, that he was no more; nor could he ever gain any further information. To procure, however, &s;ome ac|count of his father-in-law, was one rea&s;on, though known only to him&s;elf, that induced him to lengthen his journey into Italy; but, on his arrival there, finding his health wor&s;e, he left it rather precipitately. During the &s;hort &s;tay he made, he u&s;ed every means in his power to find out &s;ome one who was acquainted with affairs relative to the death of the baron: but all proved ineffectual; for he under|&s;tood that he left his villa &s;uddenly, and &s;ettled in France, where he died. His lord&s;hip now gave up every thought of &s;earching any further, and him&s;elf departed for Paris.</P>
<P>As a minute inve&s;tigation concerning Alfred's conduct could not very well be entered into before a third per|&s;on, the baron agreed to lord Albourne's invitation to &s;up that evening with him; and, after many congratulations on both &s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, they parted; not, however, without a pro|mi&s;e

from Matilda to &s;pend the next day with them. Al|fred was informed of the proceedings of this vi&s;it, and was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed and hurt at lord Albourne's doubts re&s;pecting his character being &s;o difficult to be obliterated; but a moment's reflection &s;oon ended his a&s;toni&s;hment; he knew his lord&s;hip had more than once &s;een him deeply en|gaged in play with men notoriou&s;ly known as profe&s;&s;ed gamblers, and in every re&s;pect a di&s;grace to &s;ociety. The little pique he had at fir&s;t conceived now vani&s;hed, and he admired that particularity he had before condemned. The baron attended his lord&s;hip at an early hour; while Alfred and his &s;i&s;ter &s;pent the evening among a private party of friends.</P>
<P>The baron, on his return, mentioned that he had removed every objection lord Albourne had entertained again&s;t Alfred Ma&s;erini, and that he had brought him an invita|tion to accompany Matilda and him&s;elf the next day, to dine with his lord&s;hip. With heart-felt joy he returned the old gentleman a thou&s;and thanks, who now declared he mu&s;t &s;hift for him&s;elf, relative to any other wi&s;h he had to gratify through the reconciliation.</P>
<P>The next day Alfred had the felicity to be received with the cordiality of &s;incere friend&s;hip by lord Albourne, the utmo&s;t politene&s;s by madame Bo&s;ivi, and in a manner that an&s;wered his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations by lady Caroline.</P>
<P>They parted at rather a late hour, with an appointment for lord Albourne, madame Bo&s;ivi, and lady Caroline, to &s;pend the next day but one with the baron, and, as he was plea&s;ed to term them, his adopted children. Alfred obtained permi&s;&s;ion to call at madame Bo&s;ivi's the next morning, to inquire after their health, and, as lord Al|bourne laughingly added, to &s;igh away an hour with Caro|line.</P>

They found, on their return home, Henry Peviquil's card, which mentioned he &s;hould call on them the next day. Tire&s;ome as his company might be to them, common po|litene&s;s dictated they &s;hould receive him. At a late hour the figure of the once elegant and hand&s;ome Henry Peviquil knocked at their door, worn out in con&s;titution, though, according to years, hardly in the prime of life. He was only the &s;hadow of what he formely was; and his appear|ance, in point of dre&s;s, indicated that his pecuniary cir|cum&s;tances were by no means affluent; yet &s;till he was gay to a folly, and cheerful almo&s;t to madne&s;s: in &s;hort, he was a profe&s;&s;ed gambler, and a noted debauchee; account|ed an Engli&s;hman of the fir&s;t <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> in France, and a man of the fir&s;t ta&s;te and fa&s;hion in his own country; he was the very quinte&s;&s;ence of high life in London, and allowed at Paris to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that <HI>je ne &s;ai quoi,</HI> which &s;tamped on him the real character of a <HI>fine gentleman.</HI> Among the generality of the ladies of rank of both nations, he was adored as a man of gallantry; nor were their ideas wrong: a man of gallantry he certainly was; for, to his great ho|nour, he had &s;educed more women, and afterwards for&s;aken them, than one half of his &s;ex; and, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, the <HI>etiquette</HI> of both kingdoms encouraged his noble and &s;pirited conduct.</P>
<P>The poor innocent girl whom his cur&s;ed arts had taught to love him, entangled like the defencele&s;s fly in the web of a &s;pider, falls a &s;acrifice to the en&s;narer. Mark the re|&s;ult of his enterpri&s;e: the mi&s;erable object finds her&s;elf betrayed by the man whom her guiltle&s;s heart taught her to &s;uppo&s;e as generous as he was in&s;inuating; the <HI>delicacy of virtuous women</HI> forces them to di&s;card the child of affliction, and victim of unmanly cruelty; while the author of her di&s;grace receives double &s;plendour from the deed be|coming

coming public, and is cheri&s;hed by that &s;ociety, and nou|ri&s;hed by tho&s;e comforts, from which he has hurled her for ever. Shameful prejudice! Though a national cu&s;tom, it is a di&s;grace to its followers, and &s;tands the criterion of a narrow mind, and unfeeling &s;oul.</P>
<P>Henry Peviquil, as was before mentioned in the former part of this little hi&s;tory, did not, when he found Matilda for&s;aken by her friends (at lea&s;t by tho&s;e who &s;hould have pro|ved them&s;elves &s;uch) behave to her in a manner altogether con&s;i&s;tent with rectitude or politene&s;s; and his manners at la&s;t became rude and in&s;ulting. He once had the au|dacity to make propo&s;als which gave her the mo&s;t &s;erious alarms while &s;he remained in his power. The &s;cene was entirely changed; the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed orphan of the Ma&s;erini family, de&s;pi&s;ed by his mother, contemptuou&s;ly treated by his &s;i&s;ter, forgot by his father, and in&s;ulted by him&s;elf, was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or in every re&s;pect likely to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of rank, fortune, and friends. Even the a&s;&s;urance of Henry Peviquil, now quite &s;ober, could not overcome a little embarra&s;&s;ment as he addre&s;&s;ed them; he, however, &s;oon got the better of this vulgar failing.</P>
<P>For fear, however, that the &s;pirit or honour of this ac|compli&s;hed gentleman &s;hould be called in que&s;tion for thus &s;eeking to recommence an acquaintance he formerly di&s;|dained, and with per&s;ons who received his offers of friend|&s;hip with that coolne&s;s which could not prompt him to go on with the pur&s;uit, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to inform the rea|der that he had intere&s;t in view: be&s;ides gratifying his pride, to cla&s;s them among other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction whom he could familiarly nod at in public places of enter|tainment, or chat with at the rout of a woman of fa&s;hion, he was actuated by another motive, more powerful by far; he knew Alfred had loved play; he was him&s;elf a perfect

ma&s;ter of the art, and was well acquainted with the power|ful infatuation that encircles the votaries to that way of de&s;truction; therefore, whatever he might have heard rela|tive to his having entirely given up the gaming-table, he conceived to be merely fabulous, and only rai&s;ed either to introduce him to lord Albourne's e&s;teem, or to be of &s;ervice in the intended trial. Now Henry Peviquil knew, if he could but once more draw him among tho&s;e &s;cenes he had formerly frequented, he would prove a very fit per&s;on to become a dupe to his artifices; and this was the more to be de&s;ired, as he had ju&s;t entered into a party &s;omething &s;imi|lar to that in which D'Ollifont had been engaged, and into which the baron Sampi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was introduced at Genoa.</P>
<P>With the&s;e very honourable determinations, he waited on his di&s;tant relations; but he had the mortification to ob|&s;erve that all the advances he made were received with mere civility, and that there appeared very little hopes of Alfred ever again attempting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> faro table.</P>
<P>With great coolne&s;s they parted, and Henry Peviquil &s;a|tisfied him&s;elf with declaring, at all the fa&s;hionable par|ties, that the whole trio, meaning the baron, Alfred, and his &s;i&s;ter, were quite <HI>outre;</HI> and informing his new col|leagues, whom he had fed with hopes of bringing a new pigeon to exert their abilities on, that he found the fellow void of all &s;pirit, and que&s;tioned if he had integrity enough to pay a debt of honour before a trade&s;man's bill.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER. XLV.</HEAD>
<P>MATILDA now propo&s;ed a vi&s;it which &s;he had in con|templation ever &s;ince their arrival in France, which was to the mother of Agnes. She li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed &s;ome di&s;tance from Pa|ris. Accordingly the fair fugitive and her&s;elf &s;et off the next day, attended by one &s;ervant; while the baron and Alfred were engaged to dine with lord Albourne. They that morning received a letter from lord Milverne, which mentioned his having made every inquiry relative to his lord&s;hip and lady Caroline, but that all his endeavours proved u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Alfred had, however, di&s;patched a letter to inform him of their unexpected di&s;covery, and his own happine&s;s; which he &s;uppo&s;ed would have come to his hands before the date of his from England.</P>
<P>Agnes and Matilda pur&s;ued their journey, and, after a day's quick travelling, found them&s;elves at the place of their de&s;tination. The heart of the former throbbed with various emotions: love, fear, joy, and doubt, alternately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her bo&s;om; while the effects might clearly be per|ceived in her countenance. The &s;ervant knocked at the door, and a young girl, whom Agnes did not know, opened it. She in&s;tantly exclaimed, "My mother is dead!"</P>
<P>Unable to proceed further, &s;he nearly fainted. Matilda, with as much compo&s;ure as &s;he could a&s;&s;ume, a&s;ked if the per&s;on who inhabited that cottage &s;ome months pa&s;t, was living.</P>
<P>The girl an&s;wered, "Yes, and within."</P>
<P>Agnes cla&s;ped her hands in ec&s;ta&s;y. Matilda fir&s;t alighted, and entered. A middle-aged woman was &s;eated

knitting: &s;he aro&s;e at the entrance of the &s;tranger, and &s;eemed rather confu&s;ed.</P>
<P>"You had," &s;aid Matilda, "a daughter?"</P>
<P>She changed colour, and could hardly articulate "Yes." "And you lo&s;t her?"</P>
<P>She with &s;till greater difficulty repeated the &s;ame an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation proceeded no further: Agnes ru&s;hed into the room, and was in&s;tantly in the arms of her mother.</P>
<P>Tears relieved them both, and the latter then reque&s;ted to know by what act of providence &s;he was thus ble&s;&s;ed beyond expre&s;&s;ion. Matilda related to her mo&s;t of the cir|cum&s;tances that had happened to her daughter &s;ince &s;he left the cottage, and concluded with an inquiry after M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Le Selet.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion confu&s;ed her greatly; and, after a few mo|ments, &s;he replied, &s;he had &s;een him but once &s;ince her daughter left her; but had heard he was dead.</P>
<P>Matilda now turned the di&s;cour&s;e relative to her behaviour to that gentleman and her child. Her words carried in them a &s;evere rebuke to the imprudent mother, who ap|peared to be perfectly convinced of her error, and declared &s;he had not enjoyed one moment of felicity &s;ince her daughter's elopement, torn as &s;he was with remor&s;e for her cruel conduct towards her.</P>
<P>Oliver, they under&s;tood, was well, and lived only for Agnes. He was &s;ent for; and their meeting can only be conceived&mdash;not de&s;cribed.&mdash;Matilda experienced the mo&s;t heart-felt plea&s;ure in &s;ettling every point with the old lady relative to their marriage, and rewarding this faithful and truly innocent girl with the be&s;t gift &s;he could be&s;tow on her, a good hu&s;band. She gave Oliver an invitation to return with Agnes to Paris (who was to &s;tay with her mother a few days) when they &s;hould be united, and he

receive with his bride a portion &s;ufficient to put them into a way of life that with indu&s;try would procure them every nece&s;&s;ary and comfort they could wi&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Matilda remained at the cottage that night; the next day returned alone, and joined Alfred and the baron at madame Bo&s;ivi's in the evening, where they were engaged to &s;upper. Here &s;he was informed that it had been reported the whole day that D'Ollifont was no more: it was not, however, by any means confirmed.</P>
<P>On their entering their lodgings they were told by the &s;ervant that a &s;trange gentleman had called, who parti|cularly wi&s;hed to &s;ee Mr. Ma&s;erini, or the baron. In vain they endeavoured to imagine who it could be; their efforts were fruitle&s;s, and they retired un&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>They had ju&s;t &s;et down to breakfa&s;t the next morning, when they were informed the &s;ame gentleman reque&s;ted to be admitted. He was accordingly introduced; but he was entirely unknown to them all. His dre&s;s was plain; yet there was much of the gentleman in his manner, and he &s;eemed to be in the decline of life. They politely a&s;ked to know his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"My bu&s;ine&s;s," he an&s;wered, "is rather of a &s;trange nature; and the character I come under, will, I doubt, give you no very good opinion of my honour or integrity."</P>
<P>Alfred, Matilda, and the baron, were a&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P>"I am, continued the vi&s;itor, "the &s;teward of count D'Ol|lifont."</P>
<P>They were &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I perceive your countenances change," &s;aid he. "But &s;u&s;pend your exclamations for a moment, while I inform you, not now of the murderer or u&s;urper of another's right, but the dying guilty wretch, who waits, with all the horrors of a hell before him, to receive the awful change that plunges him into eternity."</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="035833_0336_10093FC0448B6420">
They were in &s;ome degree affected, and he was reque&s;ted to be &s;eated.</P>
<P>"Alas!" he cried, "I am not without my &s;hare of mi&s;ery, which fell on all that came within his de&s;troying power. My name is calumniated for ever: by the multi|tude I am called the confidant of a fiend whom I dete&s;t as much as they, but who&s;e infernal &s;nares beguiled my un|&s;u&s;pecting &s;oul, and hurled me to de&s;truction. Yet I now come to fulfil his la&s;t reque&s;t. Before his eyes are clo&s;ed for ever, he wi&s;hes to behold, what I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e would bla&s;t his very &s;ight&mdash;the baron Sampieno, Mr. Ma&s;erini, and his &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the amazement of all three.</P>
<P>"The count," he continued, "four days ago made his will, in which he re&s;igns all right to the e&s;tates of his late uncle; and, in &s;ome degree, to make what poor reparation is in his power, he has bequeathed the whole of his fortune, except &s;ome &s;mall annuities in charity, to be equally divi|ded between the baron and the two &s;urviving heirs of the Ma&s;erini family. The amount of this property is nearly &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds. No &s;cruples need prevent your receiving it, &s;ince it has not been accumulated by the frauds he has been guilty of, but by the favour he was once in at the court of France."</P>
<P>He begged to know their determination; for, if they con&s;ented to the wi&s;hes of the dying man, he would him&s;elf conduct them at any hour of the day they cho&s;e to appoint. It required &s;ome little time to re&s;olve; but at length com|pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ufferings of the criminal D'Ollifont overcame every other argument again&s;t the vi&s;it, and they fixed three o'clock that day.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eward departed, and promi&s;ed to be with them at that hour.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="035833_0337_10093FE74D66EC68">
They con&s;idered that at all events there could be no danger whatever in this reque&s;t, as officers of ju&s;tice re&s;ided in the hou&s;e. They, however, determined to take two of their own &s;ervants. The per&s;on whom they had ju&s;t &s;een, was, they had no doubt, Rabourn, whom they had heard lord Milverne mention in no very favourable manner; but they had found, &s;ince their re&s;idence in Paris, that his character had been cleared by D'Ollifont's own confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At three o'clock Rabourn arrived, and all four &s;et off in the baron's carriage, attended by two men, to the count's man&s;ion. Their ride was &s;hort, as he lived at no great di&s;tance from their own re&s;idence.&mdash;During the time, how|ever, they under&s;tood by the &s;teward that he was much wor&s;e than in the fore part of the day, and that he left him in &s;trong convul&s;ions; he therefore conceived (as the &s;ight of him might be too great a &s;hock to mi&s;s Ma&s;erini's feelings) that &s;he had better not enter his chamber, unle&s;s he &s;hould &s;o far recover as to mention again a wi&s;h to &s;ee her. This was &s;ettled, and they pre&s;ently &s;topped at the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>They were conducted through a &s;uperb hall into an ele|gant apartment: the &s;ervants were de&s;ired to follow, and remained here with them, while Rabourn went into the &s;ick man's chamber, which was the next room. He retur|ned, and informed them his convul&s;ions were gone off, but he was afraid he was &s;peechle&s;s; though he &s;eemed, how|ever, to look as if he wi&s;hed to know whether they were come. Matilda begged to remain where &s;he was, unle&s;s he &s;hould, by &s;igns or words, expre&s;s a de&s;ire to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>The &s;teward led the way; Alfred and the baron follow|ed, through a pair of folding doors, to an elegant bed-room, beautifully furni&s;hed in the riche&s;t ta&s;te. At the further end was the count's bed, of crim&s;on &s;atin, with gold trim|mings. Two phy&s;icians, two nur&s;es, a confe&s;&s;or, and three
<PB N="162" REF="035833_0338_10093FC321D40CA8">
&s;ervants, &s;tood round, and, at intervals, admini&s;tered cor|dials to their patient. The curtains were pulled on one &s;ide; and, extended on the bed, lay the wretched man, &s;urrounded with elegance, clothed in the fine&s;t linen, and reclined on a matra&s;s of down. But what were the luxu|ries, the paltry elegances, that &s;urrounded him? Could the &s;tructure of the room, the beauty of the furniture, the rich|ne&s;s of the canopy under which he lay, or the downy &s;oft|ne&s;s of his bed, give to him that comfort, that con&s;olation or fortitude, which the awful cri&s;is required?</P>
<P>Alas! no; every moment did the trembling victim of guilt and ambition expect to &s;ee the gilded &s;cene of earth|ly pride vani&s;h into darkne&s;s, and that darkne&s;s open to him he knew not what&mdash;but which it was hell to him only to conceive.</P>
<P>Alfred and the baron advanced &s;lowly. D'Ollifont's eyes turned upon them: a kind of cold &s;hivering &s;eized him, and drops of per&s;piration appeared on his forehead, which one of the nur&s;es dried off with a mu&s;lin handkerchief.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of his diabolical exi&s;tence, many were the &s;ighs he had wrung from the widow, the fatherle&s;s, and the unprotected; yet the damp mu&s;lin that received the&s;e guilty drops of horror and remor&s;e of con&s;cience, might be &s;aid in &s;ome mea&s;ure to atone for the innocent tears he had drawn from female di&s;tre&s;s. Who could tell his pangs, the inward workings of his &s;oul? Who could tell the convul|&s;ive terror that &s;hook every limb? Who could tell his &s;ecret thoughts that bla&s;ted every hope?</P>
<P>His &s;en&s;es failed him the moment the vi&s;itors appeared. His convul&s;ions returned with double force, and a fourth &s;ervant was obliged to be called in, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the others in holding him. He raved on the names of Ma&s;erini and Sam|pieno; then, &s;pent with exertion, bit his under lip with
<PB N="163" REF="035833_0339_10093FEA34C4A2F0">
&s;uch violence that blood flowed abundantly from his mouth.</P>
<P>His ravings again returned. By a &s;udden &s;natch he di&s;|engaged him&s;elf from hold; and, with a kind of exultation in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ace, which was now partly black, he tore a large root of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> from his head; then, with a &s;tifled laugh, fell life|le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n the pillow.</P>
<P>Such was the end of the mo&s;t tyrannical, cruel and un|exampled villain&mdash;a di&s;grace to the world, a &s;courge to his fellow-creatures, and a cur&s;e to him&s;elf. Ambition was the bait that beguiled him: and that ambition did but mock him when he lay a disfigured corp&s;e under the hang|ings of an elegant canopy.</P>
<P>Alfred, the baron, and Rabourne, withdrew to the next apartment, all greatly &s;hocked. They were informed that Matilda was in one of the lower rooms; the cries of the dying D'Ollifont were too much for her.</P>
<P>The news of the count's death was no &s;ooner told than the whole hou&s;e was in con&s;iderable confu&s;ion, and the ba|ron reque&s;ted to know who was to have the management of his affairs. The &s;teward informed them, the will mention|ed it &s;hould be jointly executed by Mr. Ma&s;erini and him|&s;elf. He a&s;&s;ured them every thing was left in &s;o exact a manner that it would occa&s;ion them very little trouble.&mdash;The count, before their arrival, had confe&s;&s;ed every circum|&s;tance relative to the murders, which would, without any trial, put them at once into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their right.</P>
<P>Rabourn produced the will, and it contained every thing he had mentioned. After having inve&s;ted him with po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|er to give all nece&s;&s;ary orders relative to the funeral and other matters, they departed to their lodgings.</P>
<P>The di&s;agreeable &s;cene they had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed, was re|paid by the &s;ight of lord Milverne, who received Alfred's letter the very day he &s;ent off his own, and followed him|&s;elf immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="035833_0340_10093FC4A8E452A0">
He congratulated them on the fortunate conclu&s;ion of their affairs, though he declared he was malicious enough to wi&s;h the&s;e events had happened after his alliance with Matilda, that he might have been able to have proved to the world the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his love.</P>
<P>That evening he accompanied them to madame Bo&s;ivi's. Lord Albourne received him as an old friend, lady Caroline, as an acquaintance whom &s;he had much e&s;teem for, and madame Bo&s;ivi, with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a more happy party than the per&s;ons who then &s;at down to &s;upper. The recollection of their pa&s;t misfortunes endeared to them their pre&s;ent felici|ty; and they all agreed that a life tinctured with adver&s;ity, receives that glow of happine&s;s which an in&s;ipid medium never produces.</P>

<P>THAT virtue and vice are their own rewards, is a pro|verb generally allowed; it is certainly founded on truth, and exemplified in almo&s;t every occurrence of life.</P>
<P>It requires but little ob&s;ervation, to perceive that the comforts, even the &s;uperfluities of the world, procured by means not con&s;i&s;tent with the moral government of man|kind, lo&s;e the chief part of tho&s;e allurements which tempt|ed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to gain them by illicit tran&s;actions. The man who partakes of a &s;canty, hard-earned meal by his own indu&s;try, enjoys more than he who eats of the &s;umptu|ous repa&s;t, at the expen&s;e of a fellow-creature's mi&s;ery and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This po&s;ition was proved in D'Ollifont, and the prin|cipal &s;ufferers by his villany, the baron, Alfred, and his &s;i&s;ter: by accounts they now heard from Rabourn, the count underwent far more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, though all three un|der
<PB N="166" REF="035833_0342_10093FCA450B8100">
the &s;evere&s;t la&s;h of adver&s;ity: for he was tortured by a guilty con&s;cience, and haunted by phantoms of a di&s;turbed and di&s;ordered brain.</P>
<P>His funeral was conducted by the &s;teward, who in the will was left a &s;mall but decent competency; and to it Alfred, his &s;i&s;ter, and the baron, added a con&s;iderable &s;um. The legacies were many of them overpaid, by their joint con&s;ent, to tho&s;e who were in want of it. In a very &s;hort time all the affairs were properly &s;ettled, and the children of the Ma&s;erini family became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all their right, by a &s;hort though regular proce&s;s in law. Agnes and Oli|ver returned at the time appointed; the latter was intro|duced to the baron, and Alfred (now count Ma&s;erini) and received from them no incon&s;iderable marks of favour.</P>
<P>Matilda conceived it would be proper Agnes's mother &s;hould be &s;ent for, to be pre&s;ent at her daughter's marriage, which was con&s;ummated about a fortnight after their ar|rival at Paris. She returned the count and his &s;i&s;ter a thou&s;and thanks, and received from both a hand&s;ome pre|&s;ent. It was now determined, Oliver and his wife &s;hould &s;et off for Gra&s;ville Abbey. Count Ma&s;erini intended to have it put in repair, and fixed upon him as a proper per&s;on to &s;uperintend them, as he had been originally brought up in that line; for Leonard, who was &s;till there, was too much advanced in years to take the care upon him&s;elf. It was, however, left entirely to their own inclination, and they both gladly accepted the offer.</P>
<P>It was about a week after their departure, when the count Ma&s;erini and lady Caroline Albourne, lord Milverne and Matilda, were on one day united. Lord Albourne and the baron &s;ighed at the altar, and could hardly &s;tifle a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, the mixture of acute &s;orrow and extreme plea&s;ure; half of it might be &s;aid to ari&s;e at the recollection of the time when
<PB N="167" REF="035833_0343_10093FEF4092E960">
they were together at a &s;imilar ceremony, the former as the enraptured bridegroom, the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter as the doating parent: the other half was occa&s;ioned by their pre&s;ent felicity, though under different characters; the bridegroom tran&s;|formed to the parent, and the parent to the &s;till further ti|tle of grandfather, viewing in the child of his departed daughter every virtue, every female accompli&s;hment, he though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had for ever lo&s;t, when deprived of the affection|ate tie of parental tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Both the count and lord Milverne now &s;aw them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every happine&s;s they could even form a wi&s;h to have procured: this thought, as it cro&s;&s;ed the mind of the former, by a rain of ideas incident to it, brought to his ima|gination that moment, when, with the &s;word of his de|parted father, he was going to put an end to his exi&s;tence in a &s;it of phren&s;y and de&s;pair. He blu&s;hed at the recollec|tion of an event which he now almo&s;t &s;huddered to think of; it held forth to him a &s;triking le&s;&s;on again&s;t a want of fortitude, and a ra&s;h unmanly precipitation.</P>
<P>They remained at Paris but a week after the marriage, and then &s;et off for England, as it was their invention to &s;pend in London the remainder of the winter &s;ea&s;on (which was now ju&s;t commenced) return to France about June, and the latter end of the year proceed to Gra&s;ville Abbey, which would by that time be ready for their reception.</P>
<P>Their arrival in this metropolis was immediately known in the fa&s;hionable world; and one of the fir&s;t parties that received the general whi&s;per, was that of lady Peviquil. They had &s;lept in their hou&s;e in Berkley-&s;quare but one night, when the next morning their breakfa&s;t table was co|vered with cards of invitation and congratulations from different quarters, and among them one from &s;ir Anthony and his lady.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="035833_0344_10093FCD807A6FC0">
Mo&s;t of the per&s;ons who&s;e names they mentioned, called in the cour&s;e of the morning, and formed a complete groupe or levee; the chief part of which had &s;hunned them with adver&s;e eyes in the chilling part of their misfortunes, but who now courted their acquaintance with a &s;ycophantic earne&s;tne&s;s, when they found them encircled by the warm rays of pro&s;perity and affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">e. All the&s;e were received with a very cool and di&s;tant civility, and among them was lady Peviquil, who, with the true deceitful &s;imper of a courtier, de&s;cended from an elegant equipage, and, forcing her way through a crowd of the great world to the upper end of the drawing-room, in the mo&s;t whining tone of ten|derne&s;s declared her&s;elf "happy beyond expre&s;&s;ion at &s;ee|ing them returned to England." Her compliments were received as tho&s;e of a per&s;on whom they had never before &s;een; and her lady&s;hip had the mortification to return with her pride extremely hurt at the reception &s;he received.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent the allotted time in London with con&s;ider|able happine&s;s and felicity, their time equally divided a|mong &s;elect friends and public places of amu&s;ement, they returned to Paris, and the hours floated, away here in the &s;ame round of enjoyment. They &s;everal times &s;aw both Henry Peviquil and his &s;i&s;ter; the former every day be|came more low and depraved; the latter, for&s;aken by the man whom &s;he eloped with from her father's hou&s;e, was now the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of an Italian marquis, who&s;e character by no means added lu&s;tre to his title.</P>
<P>At their return to Gra&s;ville Abbey they found all the re|pairs fini&s;hed entirely to their liking; and though the &s;truc|ture was by no means robbed of its gothic elegance in the external part, yet it was made far more convenient and comfortable in the internal: the chapel was hand&s;omely fitted up, and a tomb erected to the memory of their fa|ther,
<PB N="169" REF="035833_0345_10093FF344C52D18">
mother and aunt. They found the good old Leonard in perfect health; and his happine&s;s at &s;eeing them was extreme.</P>
<P>The count received a promi&s;e from lord Milverne and his &s;i&s;ter that they would &s;pend three months in every year with them at the abbey. It was &s;ettled the baron and lord Albourne &s;hould do the &s;ame; Paris agreed with them both far better than Italy; and they determined to live together the remainder of their lives.</P>
<P>The man&s;ion of D'Ollifont was fixed on for their habi|tation; and madame Bo&s;ivi con&s;ented to take the care of their hou&s;ehold upon her&s;elf. No great di&s;tance from it lord Milverne bought an elegant chateau, which both him&s;elf and Matilda determined to make their general re&s;idence; though his lord&s;hip made her promi&s;e to &s;pend &s;ome little time every two years in England.</P>
<P>Both lord Milverne and the count had the felicity, about twelve months after their marriage, to cla&s;p to their bo&s;oms, under the tender title of father, a blooming infant; the former a girl, the latter a boy. The families were &s;eldom divided; for, when lord Milverne and his lady, with the baron and lord Albourne, had &s;pent the allotted time with the count, both he and the counte&s;s, after a very &s;hort in|terval, returned the vi&s;it at Paris.</P>
<P>Agnes and Oliver, as &s;oon as the repairs were entirely fini&s;hed at Gra&s;ville Abbey, returned to lord and lady Mil|verne at Paris; the latter was made &s;teward and principal over&s;eer of the chateau, while his wife was the favourite and friendly attendant of Matilda.</P>
<P>Leonard remained at Gra&s;ville Abbey; and, being too much advanced in years to take upon him&s;elf the office of &s;uperintendant, lived in it with a &s;ervant to attend him, received a hand&s;ome income from the count, and an annual pre&s;ent from lady Milverne.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="035833_0346_10093FCF06B4E758">
The principal per&s;ons of this little hi&s;tory enjoyed their pre&s;ent happine&s;s, by a recollection of former &s;cenes of ad|ver&s;ity, which taught them to feel for the unfortunate, and at the &s;ame time gave them the highe&s;t gratification, by being enabled to alleviate their di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Sir Anthony and lady Peviquil continued their round of fa&s;hionable folly, till age impeded their cour&s;e, and ca&s;t an in&s;ipidity on tho&s;e &s;cenes which had con&s;tituted the chief plea&s;ure of their lives. No relief opened it&s;elf to their view; di&s;&s;ipation had been their whole &s;tudy; and, when that failed, their exi&s;tence became a burthen.</P>
<P>Void of all fortitude, di&s;gu&s;ted with each other, and the world in general, they &s;unk into their grave much about the &s;ame time, and with the &s;ame horrors before them; leaving behind but ju&s;t property enough to pay their debts, and bury them in the pompous manner they had ordered.</P>
<P>Henry Peviquil continued his run of gambling in France for near four years, when he became &s;o notorious in that country as to be obliged to quit it for England. From his father, however, he could get no a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, after a period of eight years, during which time he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by common &s;windling, he was taken up for a highway robbery, received &s;entence of death, but took the king's mercy by accepting tran&s;portation, and died on the voyage.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter lived with the Italian marquis before mention|ed, for about two years; when &s;he eloped with his valet de chambre into Switzerland, where he u&s;ed her exceed|ingly ill; and, for an attempt on his life, &s;he was obliged to fly to a remote part of the country, was &s;uddenly taken ill, and died in her twenty-eighth year.</P>
<P>Oliver and Agnes led a life of the utmo&s;t &s;erenity and comfort: they had &s;everal children, which proved a com|fort to their increa&s;ing years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and all turned out valuable members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="035833_0347_10093FF60865B438">
The good old Leonard enjoyed but a few years of felici|ty; he however lived to &s;pend &s;ome time with every ble&s;|&s;ing he could wi&s;h, and to &s;ee all tho&s;e &s;cenes reali&s;ed that his mo&s;t &s;anguine ideas could have formed.</P>
<P>Lord Albourne died about twelve years after his daugh|ters's marriage; the baron felt mo&s;t &s;everely his lo&s;s; in &s;hort, this might be &s;aid to be the fir&s;t event that occa&s;ion|ed any con&s;iderable damp on the happine&s;s of the two fa|milies. The chief part of his lord&s;hip's fortune was left to his daughter, and a con&s;iderable legacy to lord and lady Milverne.</P>
<P>The baron Sampieno, after lord Albourne's death, re|&s;ided with lord Milverne, as madame Bo&s;ivi died of an apo|plexy a few months before his lord&s;hip. He lived to a very advanced age, ble&s;&s;ed with years of happine&s;s, that might be &s;aid in a great mea&s;ure to repay him for former misfor|tunes. He left the whole of his fortune between the count and lord Milverne.</P>
<P>The count and counte&s;s of Ma&s;erini, with lord and lady Milverne, enjoyed a long &s;eries of happine&s;s and felicity. They had each &s;everal children, and lived to &s;ee them prove an ornament to their rank and the community at large. Time heightened their ble&s;&s;ings, and their declining years were like a &s;etting &s;un, which gathers fre&s;h &s;plendour as it gradually vani&s;hes from our &s;ight.</P>
