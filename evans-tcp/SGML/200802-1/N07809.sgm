<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P><HI>_THE author had de&s;igned the&s;e di&s;&s;ertations for the public view; and wrote them out as they now appear: though 'tis probable, that if his life had been &s;pared, he would have revi&s;ed them and rendred them in &s;ome re&s;pects more compleat. Some new &s;entiments, here and there, might probably have been added; and &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages brightened with farther illu&s;trations. This may be conjectured from &s;ome brief hints, or &s;entiments minuted down, on loo&s;e papers, found in the manu&s;cripts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BUT tho&s;e &s;entiments conci&s;ely &s;ketch'd out, which, 'tis thought, the author intended to enlarge, and dige&s;t into the body of the work,&mdash;cannot be &s;o amplified by any other hand, as to do ju&s;tice to the author: 'tis therefore probably be&s;t that nothing of this kind &s;hould be attempted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AS the&s;e di&s;&s;ertations were more e&s;pecially de&s;ign'd for the learned and inqui&s;itive, 'tis expected that the judicious and candid will not be di&s;po&s;ed to object that the manner in which the&s;e &s;ubjects are treated, is &s;omething above the level of common readers. For though a &s;uperficial way of di&s;cour&s;e and loo&s;e har|rangues may well enough &s;uit &s;ome &s;ubjects, and an&s;wer &s;ome valuable purpo&s;es; yet other &s;ubjects demand more clo&s;ene&s;s and accuracy. And if an author &s;hould ne|glect to do ju&s;tice to a &s;ubject, for fear that the &s;impler &s;ort &s;hould not fully under&s;tand him, he might expect to be deemed a trifler by the more intelligent.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ii." REF="009962_0003_0F7B3D04407CC180">
<HI>OUR author had a rare talent to penetrate deep in &s;earch of truth; to take an exten&s;ive &s;urvey of a &s;ubject, and look through it into remote con&s;equences. Hence many theorems, that appeared hard and barren to others, were to him plea&s;ant and fruitful fields, where his mind would expatiate with peculiar ca&s;e, profit and entertainment. Tho&s;e &s;tudies, which to &s;ome were too fatiguing to the mind, and wearing to the con&s;titution, were to him but a natural play of genius; and which his mind without labor would freely and &s;pontaneou&s;ly perform. A clo&s;e and conclu&s;ive way of rea&s;oning upon a controver&s;ial point was ea&s;y and na|tural to him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THIS may &s;erve, tis conceiv'd, to account for his u&s;ual manner of treating ab&s;tru&s;e and controverted &s;ub|jects, which &s;ome have thought has been too metaphy|&s;ical. But the truth is, that his critical method of looking through the nature of his &s;ubject; his accuracy and preci&s;ion in conva&s;&s;ing truth, comparing ideas, drawing con&s;equences, pointing out and expo&s;ing ab&s;ur|dities,&mdash;naturally led him to reduce the evidence in favor of truth into the form of demon&s;tration. Which doubtle&s;s, where it can be obtained, is the mo&s;t eligible, and by far the mo&s;t &s;atisfying to great and noble minds. And though &s;ome readers may find the labor hard to keep pace with the writer, in the advances he makes, where the a&s;cent is arduous; yet in general all was ea&s;y to him: &s;uch was his peculiar love and di&s;cern|ment of truth and natural propen&s;ity to &s;earch after it. His own ideas were clear to him, where &s;ome rea|ders have thought them ob&s;cure. Thus many things in the works of</HI> Newton <HI>and</HI> Locke, <HI>which appear either quite unintelligible, or very ob&s;cure to the illite|rate, were clear and bright to tho&s;e illu&s;trious authors, and their learned readers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="009962_0004_0F7B3D04D9A55E60">
<HI>THE &s;ubjects here handled are &s;ublime and impor|tant. The end which God had in view in creating the world, was doubtle&s;s worthy of him; and con&s;equently the mo&s;t excellent and glorious po&s;&s;ible. This there|fore mu&s;t be worthy to be known by all the intelligent creation, as excellent in it&s;elf, and worthy of their pur|&s;uit. And as true virtue di&s;tingui&s;hes the inhabitants of heaven and all the happy candidates for that world of glory, from all others;&mdash;there cannot &s;urely be a more intere&s;ting &s;ubject.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE notions which &s;ome men entertain concerning God's end in creating the world, and concerning true virtue, in our late author's opinion, have a natural tendency to corrupt chri&s;tianity, and to de&s;troy the go&s;pel of our divine redeemer. It was therefore, no doubt, in the exerci&s;e of a pious concern for the honor and glory of God, and a tender re&s;pect to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of his fellow men, that this devout and learned writer undertook the following work.</HI></P>
<P><HI>MAY the father of lights, &s;mile upon the pious and benevolent aims and labors of his &s;ervant and crown them with his ble&s;&s;ing!</HI></P>

<HEAD>Concerning the END for which GOD created the WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing Explanations of Terms, and general Po&s;itions.</HEAD>
<P>_TO avoid all confu&s;ion in our inquiries and rea&s;onings, concerning the end for which God created the world, a di&s;tinction &s;hould be ob&s;erved between the chief end for which an agent or efficient exerts any act and per|forms any work, and the ultimate end. The&s;e two phra&s;es are not always preci&s;ely of the &s;ame &s;ig|nification: And tho' the <HI>chief</HI> end be always an <HI>ultimate</HI> end, yet every <HI>ultimate</HI> end is not always a chief end.</P>
<P>A chief end is oppo&s;ite to an inferior end: An ultimate end, is oppo&s;ite to a &s;ubordinate end. A &s;ubordinate end is &s;omething that an agent &s;eeks and aims at in what he does; but yet don't &s;eek it, or regard it at all upon it's own ac|count, but wholly on the account of a further end, or in order to &s;ome other thing, which it is con&s;idered as a means of. Thus when a man that goes a journey to ob|tain
<PB N="2" REF="009962_0008_0F7B3D09983E6BC0">
a medicine to cure him of &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e, and re&s;tore his health,&mdash;the obtaining that medicine is his &s;ubordinate end; becau&s;e 'tis not an end that he &s;eeks for it&s;elf, or values at all upon its own account; but wholly as a means of a fur|ther end, viz. his health: Separate the medicine from that further end, and it is e&s;teemed good for nothing; nor is it at all de&s;ired.</P>
<P>AN ultimate end is that which the agent &s;eeks in what he does, for it's own &s;ake: That he has re&s;pect to, as what he loves, values and takes plea&s;ure in on it's own account, and not merely as a means of a further end: As when a man loves the ta&s;te of &s;ome particular &s;ort of fruit, and is at pains and co&s;t to obtain it, for the &s;ake of the plea&s;ure of that ta&s;te, which he values upon it's own account, as he loves his own plea&s;ure; and not merely for the &s;ake of any other good, which he &s;uppo&s;es his enjoying that plea&s;ure will be the means of.</P>
<P>SOME ends are &s;ubordinate ends, not only as they are &s;ub|ordinated to an ultimate end; but al&s;o to another end that is it&s;elf but a &s;ubordinate end: Yea, there may be a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or chain of many &s;ubordinate ends, one dependent on ano|ther,&mdash;one &s;ought for another: The fir&s;t for the next; and that for the &s;ake of the next to that,&mdash;and &s;o on in a long &s;eries before you come to any thing, that the agent aims at and &s;eeks for it's own &s;ake:&mdash;As when a man &s;ells a gar|ment to get money&mdash;to buy tools&mdash;to till his land&mdash;to ob|tain a crop&mdash;to &s;upply him with food&mdash;to gratify the appetite. And he &s;eeks to gratify his appetite, on it's own account, as what is grateful in it&s;elf. Here the end of his &s;elling his garment, is to get money; but getting money is only a &s;ub|ordinate end: Tis not only &s;ubordinate to the la&s;t end, his gratifying his appetite; but to a nearer end, viz. his buying hu&s;bandry tools: And his obtaining the&s;e, is only a &s;ubor|dinate end, being only for the &s;ake of tilling land: And the tillage of land, is an end not &s;ought on it's own account, but for the &s;ake of the crop to be produced: And the crop pro|duced, is not an ultimate end, or an end &s;ought for it&s;elf, but only for the &s;ake of making bread: And the having bread, is not &s;ought on it's own account, but for the &s;ake of grati|fying the appetite.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="009962_0009_0F7B3D0A030EC6A0">
HERE the gratifying the appetite, is called the ultimate end; becau&s;e 'tis the la&s;t in the chain, where a man's aim and pur&s;uit &s;tops and re&s;ts, obtaining in that, the thing finally aimed at. So whenever a man comes to that in which his de&s;ire terminates and re&s;ts, it being &s;omething valued on it's own account, then he comes to an ultimate end, let the chain be longer or &s;horter; yea, if there be but one link or one &s;tep that he takes before he comes to this end. As when a man that loves honey puts it into his mouth, for the &s;ake of the plea&s;ure of the ta&s;te, without aiming at any thing fur|ther. So that an end which an agent has in view, may be both his immediate and his ultimate end; his next and his la&s;t end. That end which is &s;ought for the &s;ake of it&s;elf, and not for the &s;ake of a further end, is an ultimate end; it is ultimate or la&s;t, as it has no other beyond it, for who&s;e &s;ake it is, it being for the &s;ake of it&s;elf: So that here, the aim of the agent &s;tops and re&s;ts (without going further) be|ing come to the good which he e&s;teems a recompence of it's pur&s;uit for it's own value.</P>
<P>HERE it is to be noted, that a thing &s;ought, may have the nature of an ultimate, and al&s;o of a &s;ubordinate end, as it may be &s;ought partly on it's own account, and partly for the &s;ake of a further end. Thus a man in what he does, may &s;eek the love and re&s;pect of a particular per&s;on, partly on it's own account, becau&s;e 'tis in it&s;elf agreable to men to be the objects of other's e&s;teem and love: And partly, becau&s;e he hopes, through the friend&s;hip of that per&s;on to have his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in other affairs; and &s;o to be put under advantage for the obtaining further ends.</P>
<P>A chief end or highe&s;t end, which is oppo&s;ite not properly to a &s;ubordinate end, but to an inferior end, is &s;omething diver&s;e from an ultimate end. The chief end is an end that is mo&s;t valued; and therefore mo&s;t &s;ought after by the agent in what he does. 'Tis evident, that to be an end more va|lued than another end, is not exactly the &s;ame thing as to be an end valued ultimately, or for it's own &s;ake. This will appear, if it be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT two different ends may be both ultimate ends, and yet not be chief ends. They may be both valued for
<PB N="4" REF="009962_0010_0F7B3D0B4EE5CFF0">
their own &s;ake, and both &s;ought in the &s;ame work or acts, and yet one valued more highly and &s;ought more than ano|ther: Thus a man may go a journey to obtain two different benefits or enjoyments, both which may be agreable to him in them&s;elves con&s;idered, and &s;o both may be what he values on their own account and &s;eeks for their own &s;ake; And yet one may be much more agreable than the other: And &s;o be what he &s;ets his heart chiefly upon, and &s;eeks mo&s;t after in his going a journey. Thus a man may go a journey partly to obtain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of a bride that is very dear to him, and partly to gratify his curio&s;ity in looking in a tele&s;cope, or &s;ome new-invented and extraordinary optic gla&s;s: Both may be ends he &s;eeks in his journey, and the one not properly &s;ubordinate or in order to another. One may not depend on another; and therefore both may be ultimate ends: But yet the obtaining his beloved bride may be his chief end, and the benefit of the optic gla&s;s, his inferior end. The former may be what he &s;ets his heart va&s;tly mo&s;t upon; and &s;o be properly the chief end of his journey.</P>
<P N="2">2. AN ultimate end is not always the chief end, becau&s;e &s;ome &s;ubordinate ends may be more valued and &s;ought after than &s;ome ultimate ends. Thus for in&s;tance, a man may aim at the&s;e two things in his going a journey; one may be to vi&s;it his friends, and another to receive a great e&s;tate, or a large &s;um of money that lies ready for him, at the place to which he is going. The latter, viz. his receiving the &s;um of money may be but a &s;ubordinate end: He may not value the &s;ilver and gold on their own account, but only for the plea&s;ure, gratifications and honor; that is the ultimate end, and not the money which is valued only as a means of the other. But yet the obtaining the money, may be what is more valued, and &s;o an higher end of his journey, than the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his friends; tho' the latter is what is valued on its own account, and &s;o is an ultimate end.</P>
<P>BUT here &s;everal things may be noted:</P>
<P>FIRST, That when it is &s;aid, that &s;ome &s;ubordinate ends may be more valued than &s;ome ultimate ends, 'tis not &s;uppo&s;ed that ever a &s;ubordinate end is more valued than that ultimate end or ends to which it is &s;ubordinate; becau&s;e a &s;ubordinate
<PB N="5" REF="009962_0011_0F7B3D0BCA9B1298">
end has no value, but what it derives from its ultimate end: For that rea&s;on it is called a &s;ubordinate end, becau&s;e it is va|lued and &s;ought, not for it's own &s;ake, or it's own value, but only in &s;ubordination to a further end, or for the &s;ake of the ultimate end, that it is in order to. But yet a &s;ubordinate end may be valued more than &s;ome other ultimate end that it is not &s;ubordinate to, but is independent of it, and don't belong to that &s;eries, or chain of ends. Thus for in&s;tance: If a man goes a journey to receive a &s;um of money, not at all as an ulti|mate end, or becau&s;e he has any value for the &s;ilver and gold for their own &s;ake, but only for the value of the plea&s;ure and honor that the money may be a means of. In this ca&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;ubordinate end, viz. his having the money &s;hould be more valued by him than the plea&s;ure and honor, for which he values it. It would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that he values the means more than the end, when he has no value for the means but for the &s;ake of the end, of which it is the means: But yet he may value the money, tho' but a &s;ubor|dinate end, more than &s;ome other ultimate end, to which it is not &s;ubordinate, and with which it has no connection. For in&s;tance, more than the comfort of a friendly vi&s;it; which was one end of his journey.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Not only is a &s;ubordinate end never &s;uperior to that ultimate end, to which it is &s;ubordinate; but the ulti|mate end is always (not only equal but) &s;uperior to it's &s;ubordinate end, and more valued by the agent; unle&s;s it be when the ultimate end entirely depends on the &s;ubordi|nate: So that he has no other means by which to obtain his la&s;t end, and al&s;o is looked upon as certainly connected with it,&mdash;then the &s;ubordinate end may be as much valued as the la&s;t end; becau&s;e the la&s;t end, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, does altogether depend upon, and is wholly and certainly convey|ed by it. As for in&s;tance, if a pregnant woman has a pecu|liar appetite to a certain rare fruit that is to be found only in the garden of a particular friend of her's, at a di&s;tance; and &s;he goes a journey to go to her friend's hou&s;e or garden, to obtain that fruit&mdash;the ultimate end of her journey, is to gratify that &s;trong appetite: The obtaining that fruit, is the &s;ubordinate end of it. If &s;he looks upon it, that the appetite can be gratified by no other means than the obtaining that fruit; and that it will certainly be gratified if &s;he obtains it,
<PB N="6" REF="009962_0012_0F7B3D0C5E6D90E8">
then &s;he will value the fruit as much as &s;he values the grati|fication of her appetite. But otherwi&s;e, it will not be &s;o: If &s;he be doubtful whether that fruit will &s;atisfy her craving, then &s;he will not value it equally with the gratification of her appetite it&s;elf; or if there be &s;ome other fruit that &s;he knows of, that will gratify her de&s;ire, at lea&s;t in part; which &s;he can obtain without &s;uch inconvenience or trouble as &s;hall countervail the gratification; which is in effect, fru&s;tra|ting her of her la&s;t end, becau&s;e her la&s;t end is the plea&s;ure of gratifying her appetite, without any trouble that &s;hall countervail, and in effect de&s;troy it. Or if it be &s;o, that her appetite cannot be gratified without this fruit, nor yet with it alone, without &s;omething el&s;e to be compounded with it,&mdash;then her value for her la&s;t end will be divided be|tween the&s;e &s;everal ingredients as &s;o many &s;ubordinate, and no one alone will be equally valued with the la&s;t end.</P>
<P>HENCE it rarely happens among mankind, that a &s;ubordi|nate end is equally valued with it's la&s;t end; becau&s;e the obtaining of a la&s;t end rarely depends on one &s;ingle, uncom|pounded means, and is infallibly connected with that means: Therefore, mens la&s;t ends are commonly their highe&s;t ends.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, If any being has but one ultimate end, in all that he does, and there be a great variety of operations, his la&s;t end may ju&s;tly be looked upon as his <HI>&s;upreme</HI> end: For in &s;uch a ca&s;e, every other end but that one, is an end to that end; and therefore no other end can be &s;uperior to it. Becau&s;e, as was ob&s;erved before, a &s;ubordinate end is never more valued, than the end to which it is &s;ubordinate.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the &s;ubordinate effects, events or things brought to pa&s;s, which all are means of this end, all uniting to contribute their &s;hare towards the obtaining the one la&s;t end, are very various; and therefore, by what has been now ob&s;erved, the ultimate end of all mu&s;t be valued, more than any one of the particular means. This &s;eems to be the ca&s;e with the works of God, as may more fully appear in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, to explain what is intended by an ultimate end, the following things may be ob&s;erved con|cerning ultimate ends in the &s;en&s;e explained.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009962_0013_0F7B3D0CFA84AEB0">
FOURTHLY, What&s;oever any agent has in view in any thing he does, which he loves, or which is an immediate gratification of any appetite or inclination of nature; and is agreable to him in it&s;elf, and not meerly for the &s;ake of &s;ome|thing el&s;e, is regarded by that agent as his la&s;t end. The &s;ame may be &s;aid, of avoiding of that which is in it&s;elf pain|ful or di&s;agreable: For the avoiding of what is di&s;agreable is agreable. This will be evident to any bearing in mind the meaning of the terms. By la&s;t end being meant, that which is regarded and &s;ought by an agent, as agreable or de|&s;ireable for it's own &s;ake; a &s;ubordinate that which is &s;ought only for the &s;ake of &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>FIFTHLY, From hence it will follow, that, if an agent in his works has in view more things than one that will be brought to pa&s;s by what he does, that are agreable to him, con&s;ider'd in them&s;elves, or what he loves and delights in on their own account,&mdash;then he mu&s;t have more things than one that he regards as his la&s;t ends in what he does. But if there be but one thing that an agent &s;eeks, as the con&s;e|quence of what he does that is agreable to him, on it's own account, then there can be but one la&s;t end which he has in all his actions and operations.</P>
<P>BUT only here a di&s;tinction mu&s;t be ob&s;erved of things which may be &s;aid to be agreable to an agent, in them&s;elves con&s;ider'd in two &s;en&s;es. (1.) What is in it&s;elf grateful to an agent, and valued and loved on its own account, <HI>&s;imply</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> con&s;idered, and is &s;o univer&s;ally and originally, antecedent to, and <HI>independent</HI> of all conditions, or any &s;up|po&s;ition of particular ca&s;es and circum&s;tances. And (2.) What may be &s;aid to be in it&s;elf agreable to an agent, <HI>hypothetically</HI> and con&s;equentially: Or, on &s;uppo&s;ition or con|dition of &s;uch and &s;uch circum&s;tances or on the happening of &s;uch a particular ca&s;e. Thus, for in&s;tance: A man may originally love &s;ociety. An inclination to &s;ociety may be implanted in his very nature: And &s;ociety may be agreable to him antecedent to all pre&s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;es and circum&s;tances: And this may cau&s;e him to &s;eek a family. And the comfort of &s;ociety may be originally his la&s;t end, in &s;eeking a family. But after he has a family, peace, good order and mutual ju&s;tice and friend&s;hip in his family, may be agreable to him,
<PB N="8" REF="009962_0014_0F7B3D0EAF25E2A0">
and what he delights in for their own &s;ake: and therefore the&s;e things may be his la&s;t end in many things he does in the government and regulation of his family. But they were not his original end with re&s;pect to his family. The ju&s;tice and peace of a family was not properly his la&s;t end before he had a family, that induced him to &s;eek a family, but con&s;equentially. And the ca&s;e being put of his having a family, then the&s;e things wherein the good order and beauty of a family con&s;i&s;t, become his la&s;t end in many things he does in &s;uch circum&s;tances. In like manner we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that God before he created the world, had &s;ome good in view, as a con&s;equence of the world's exi&s;tence that was ori|ginally agreable to him in it&s;elf con&s;idered, that inclined him to create the world, or bring the univer&s;e, with various intelligent creatures into exi&s;tence in &s;uch a manner as he created it. But after the world was created, and &s;uch and &s;uch intelligent creatures actually had exi&s;tence, in &s;uch and &s;uch circum&s;tances, then a wi&s;e, ju&s;t regulation of them was agreable to God, in it&s;elf con&s;idered. And God's love of ju&s;tice, and hatred of inju&s;tice, would be &s;ufficient in &s;uch a ca&s;e to induce God to deal ju&s;tly with his creatures, and to prevent all inju&s;tice in him towards them. But yet there is no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppo&s;ing, that God's love of doing ju&s;tly to intelligent beings, and hatred of the contrary, was what ori|ginally induced God to create the world, and make intelligent beings; and &s;o to order the occa&s;ion of doing either ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly. The ju&s;tice of God's nature makes a ju&s;t regula|tion agreable, and the contrary di&s;agreable, as there is oc|ca&s;ion, the &s;ubject being &s;uppo&s;ed, and the occa&s;ion given: But we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e &s;omething el&s;e that &s;hould incline him to create the &s;ubjects or order the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>So that perfection of God which we call his faithfulne&s;s, or his inclination to fulfil his promi&s;es to his creatures, could not properly be what moved him to create the world; nor could &s;uch a fulfilment of his promi&s;es to his creatures, be his la&s;t end, in giving the creatures being. But yet after the world is created, after intelligent creatures are made, and God has bound him&s;elf by promi&s;e to them, then that di&s;po|&s;ition which is called his faithfulne&s;s may move him in his providential di&s;po&s;als towards them: And this may be the end of many of God's works of providence, even the exerci&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="009962_0015_0F7B3D0FDF7C3228">
of his faithfulne&s;s in fulfilling his promi&s;es. And may be in the lower &s;en&s;e his la&s;t end. Becau&s;e faithfulne&s;s and truth mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be what is in it&s;elf amiable to God, and what he delights in for its own &s;ake. Thus God may have ends of particular works of providence, which are ultimate ends in a lower &s;en&s;e, which were not ultimate ends of the creation.</P>
<P>So that here we have two &s;orts of ultimate ends; one of which may be called an original, and independent ultimate end; the other con&s;equential and dependent. For 'tis evi|dent, the latter &s;ort are truly of the nature of ultimate ends: Becau&s;e, tho' their being agreable to the agent, or the agent's de&s;ire of them, be con&s;equential on the exi&s;tence, or &s;uppo&s;i|tion of proper &s;ubjects and occa&s;ion; yet the &s;ubject and oc|ca&s;ion being &s;uppo&s;ed, they are agreable and amiable in them|&s;elves. We may &s;uppo&s;e that to a righteous Being, the doing ju&s;tice between two parties, with whom he is con|cerned, is agreable in it&s;elf, and is loved for it's own &s;ake, and not merely for the &s;ake of &s;ome other end: And yet we may &s;uppo&s;e, that a de&s;ire of doing ju&s;tice between two parties, may be con&s;equential on the being of tho&s;e parties, and the occa&s;ion given.</P>
<P>THEREFORE I make a di&s;tinction between an end that in this manner is <HI>con&s;equential,</HI> and a <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> end.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved, that when I &s;peak of God's ultimate end in the creation of the world, in the following di&s;cour&s;e, I commonly mean in that highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, viz. the original ultimate end.</P>
<P>SIXTHLY, It may be further ob&s;erved, that the original ultimate end or ends of the creation of the world is <HI>alone,</HI> that which induces God to give the occa&s;ion for con&s;equential ends, by the fir&s;t creation of the world, and the original di&s;|po&s;al of it. And the more original the end is, the more ex|ten&s;ive and univer&s;al it is. That which God had primarily in view in creating, and the original ordination of the world, mu&s;t be con&s;tantly kept in view, and have a governing in|fluence in all God's works, or with re&s;pect to every thing that he does towards his creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009962_0016_0F7B3D1079049690">
AND therefore,</P>
<P>SEVENTHLY, If we u&s;e the phra&s;e ultimate end in this highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, then the &s;ame that is God's ultimate end in creating the world, if we &s;uppo&s;e but one &s;uch end, mu&s;t be what he makes his ultimate aim in all his works, in every thing he does either in creation or providence. But we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that in the u&s;e, which God puts the creatures to that he hath made, he mu&s;t evermore have a regard to the end, for which he has made them. But if we take <HI>ultimate end</HI> in the other lower &s;en&s;e, God may &s;ometimes have regard to tho&s;e things as ultimate ends, in particular works of provi|dence, which could not in any proper &s;en&s;e be his la&s;t end in creating the world.</P>
<P>EIGHTHLY, On the other hand, whatever appears to be God's ultimate end in any &s;en&s;e, of his works of providence in general, that mu&s;t be the ultimate end of the work of creation it&s;elf. For tho' it be &s;o that God may act for an end, that is an ultimate end in a lower &s;en&s;e, in &s;ome of his works of providence, which is not the ultimate end of the cre|ation of the world: Yet this doth not take place with regard to the works of providence in general. But we may ju&s;tly look upon what&s;oever has the nature of an ultimate end of God's works of providence in general, that the &s;ame is al&s;o an ultimate end of the creation of the world; for God's works of providence in general, are the &s;ame with the gene|ral u&s;e that he puts the world to that he has made. And we may well argue from what we &s;ee of the general u&s;e which God makes of the world, to the general end for which he de&s;igned the world. Tho' there may be &s;ome things that are ends of particular works of providence, that were not the la&s;t end of the creation, which are in them&s;elves grateful to God in &s;uch particular emergent circum&s;tances; and &s;o are la&s;t ends in an inferior &s;en&s;e: Yet this is only in certain ca&s;es, or particular occa&s;ions. But if they are la&s;t ends of God's proceedings in the u&s;e of the world in general, this &s;hews that his making them la&s;t ends don't depend on particular ca&s;es and circum&s;tances, but the nature of things in general, and his general de&s;ign in the being and con&s;titution of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="009962_0017_0F7B3D10C0FC03A0">
NINETHLY, If there be but one thing that is originally, and independent on any future, &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;es, agreable to God, to be obtained by the creation of the world, then there can be but one la&s;t end of God's work, in this highe&s;t &s;en&s;e: But if there are various things, properly diver&s;e one from a|nother, that are, ab&s;olutely and independently on the &s;uppo|&s;ition of any future given ca&s;es, agreable to the divine being, which are actually obtained by the creation of the world, then there were &s;everal ultimate ends of the creation, in that highe&s;t &s;en&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some Things ob&s;erved in general, which Rea&s;on dictates.</HEAD>
<P>HAving ob&s;erved the&s;e things, which are proper to be taken notice of, to prevent confu&s;ion in di&s;cour&s;es on this &s;ubject, I now proceed to con&s;ider what <HI>may,</HI> and what may <HI>not</HI> be &s;uppos'd to be God's ultimate end in the creation of the world.</P>
<P>AND in the fir&s;t place, I would ob&s;erve &s;ome things which rea&s;on &s;eems to dictate in this matter. Indeed this affair, &s;eems properly to be an affair of divine revelation. In order to be determin'd what was aimed at, or de&s;ign'd in the cre|ating of the a&s;toni&s;hing fabric of the univer&s;e which we be|hold, it becomes us to attend to and rely on what he has told us, who was the architect that built it. He be&s;t knows his own heart, and what his own ends and de&s;igns were in the wonderful works which he has wrought. Nor is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that mankind, who, while de&s;titute of revelation, by the utmo&s;t improvements of their own rea&s;on, and ad|vances in &s;cience and philo&s;ophy, could come to no clear and e&s;tabli&s;hed determination who the author of the world was,
<PB N="12" REF="009962_0018_0F7B3D1182FEAD88">
would ever have obtain'd any tolerable &s;ettled judgment of the end which the author of it propo&s;ed to him&s;elf in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o va&s;t, complicated and wonderful a work of his hands. And tho' it be true, that the revelation which God has given to men, which has been in the world as a light &s;hining in a dark place, has been the occa&s;ion of great improvement of their faculties, has taught men how to u&s;e their rea&s;on; (in which regard, notwith&s;tanding the noblene&s;s and excellency of the faculties which God had given them, they &s;eem'd to be in them&s;elves almo&s;t helple&s;s.) And tho' mankind now, thro' the long continual a&s;&s;i&s;tance they have had by this divine light, have come to attainments in the habitual exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, which are far beyond what otherwi&s;e they would have arrived to; yet I confe&s;s it wou'd be relying too much on rea&s;on, to determine the affair of God's la&s;t end in the crea|tion of the world, only by our own rea&s;on, or without being herein principally guided by divine revelation, &s;ince God has given a revelation containing in&s;tructions concerning this matter. Neverthele&s;s, as in the di&s;putes and wranglings which have been about this matter, tho&s;e objections, which have chiefly been made u&s;e of again&s;t what I think the &s;crip|tures have truly revealed, have been from the pretended dictates of rea&s;on,&mdash;<HI>I would in the fir&s;t place &s;oberly con&s;ider in a few things, what &s;eems rational to be &s;uppos'd concerning this affair;&mdash;and then proceed to con&s;ider what light divine revelation gives us in it.</HI></P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, viz. what &s;eems in it&s;elf rational to be &s;uppo&s;ed concerning this matter, I think the following things appear to be the dictates of rea&s;on:</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT no notion of God's la&s;t end in the creation of the world is agreable to rea&s;on, which would truly imply or infer any indigence, in&s;ufficiency and mutability in God; or any dependence of the Creator on the creature, for any part of his perfection or happine&s;s. Becau&s;e it is evident, by both &s;cripture and rea&s;on, that God is infinitely, eternally, un|changeably, and independently glorious and happy; that he &s;tands in no need of, cannot be profited by, or receive any thing from the creature; or be truly hurt, or be the &s;ubject of any &s;ufferings or <HI>impair</HI> of his glory and felicity from any other being. I need not &s;tand to produce the proofs of God's
<PB N="13" REF="009962_0019_0F7B3D126B22C538">
being &s;uch a one, it being &s;o univer&s;ally allowed and main|tained by &s;uch as call them&s;elves chri&s;tians.&mdash;The notion of God's creating the world in order to receive any thing pro|perly from the creature, is not only contrary to the nature of God, but incon&s;i&s;tent with the notion of creation; which implies a being's receiving it's exi&s;tence, &amp; all that belongs to it's being, out of nothing. And this implies the mo&s;t perfect, ab&s;olute and univer&s;al derivation and dependence. Now, if the creature receives it's all from God entirely and perfectly, how is it po&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould have any thing to add to God, to make him in any re&s;pect more than he was before, and &s;o the Creator become dependent on the creature?</P>
<P N="2">2. WHATSOEVER is good &amp; valuable in it&s;elf, is worthy that God &s;hou'd value for it&s;elf, &amp; on it's own account; or which is the &s;ame thing, value it with an ultimate value or re&s;pect. It is therefore worthy to be ultimately &s;ought by God, or made the la&s;t end of his action and operation; if it be a thing of &s;uch a nature as to be properly capable of being attained in any divine operation. For it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;ome things, which are valuable and excellent in them&s;elves, are not properly capable of being attained in any divine operation; becau&s;e they do not remain to be attained; but their exi&s;t|ence in all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pects, mu&s;t be conceiv'd of as prior to any divine operation. Thus God's exi&s;tence and infinite perfection, tho' infinitely valuable in them&s;elves, and infinite|ly valued by God, yet can't be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the end of any divine operation. For we can't conceive of them as in any re&s;pect con&s;equent on any works of God:&mdash;But <HI>whatever is in it&s;elf valuable, ab&s;olutely &s;o, and that is capable of being &s;ought and attained, is worthy to be made a la&s;t end of the divine ope|ration.</HI>&mdash;Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. WHATEVER that be which is in it&s;elf mo&s;t valuable, and was &s;o originally, prior to the creation of the world&punc; and which is attainable by the creation, if there be any thing which was &s;uperior in value to all others, <HI>that</HI> mu&s;t be worthy to be God's la&s;t end in the creation; and al&s;o worthy to be his highe&s;t end.&mdash;In con&s;equence of this, it will follow,</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT if God him&s;elf be in any re&s;pect properly capa|ble of being his own end in the creation of the world, then
<PB N="14" REF="009962_0020_0F7B3D12FA7535C0">
it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that he had re&s;pect to <HI>him&s;elf</HI> as his la&s;t and highe&s;t end in this work; becau&s;e he is worthy in him&s;elf to be &s;o, being infinitely the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Be|ings. All things el&s;e, with regard to worthine&s;s, importance and excellence, are perfectly as nothing in compari&s;on of him. And therefore if God e&s;teems, values, and has re&s;pect to things according to their nature and proportions, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have the greate&s;t re&s;pect to him&s;elf. It would be again&s;t the perfection of his nature, his wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, and perfect rectitude, whereby he is di&s;po&s;ed to do every thing that is fit to be done, to &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e. At lea&s;t a great part of the moral rectitude of the heart of God, whereby he is di&s;po&s;ed to every thing that is fit, &s;uitable and amiable in it&s;elf, con&s;i&s;ts in his having infinitely the highe&s;t regard to that which is in it&s;elf infinitely highe&s;t and be&s;t: Yea it is in this that it &s;eems chiefly to con&s;i&s;t.&mdash;The moral rectitude of God's heart mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in a proper and due re&s;pect of his heart to things that are objects of moral re&s;pect: That is, to intelligent beings capable of moral actions and relations. And therefore it mu&s;t chiefly con&s;i&s;t in giving due re&s;pect to that Being to whom mo&s;t is due; yea infinitely mo&s;t, and in effect all. For God is infinitely the mo&s;t worthy of re|gard. The worthine&s;s of others is as nothing to his: So that to him belongs all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect. To him belongs the whole of the re&s;pect that any moral agent, either God, or any intelligent Being is capable of. To him belongs all the heart&mdash;Therefore if moral rectitude of heart con&s;i&s;ts in paying the re&s;pect or regard of the heart which is due, or which fitne&s;s &amp; &s;uitablene&s;s requires, fitne&s;s requires infinite|ly the greate&s;t regard to be paid to God; and the denying &s;upreme regard here, would be a conduct infinitely the mo&s;t unfit. Therefore a proper regard to this Being, is what the fitne&s;s of regard does infinitely mo&s;t con&s;i&s;t in.&mdash;Hence it will follow&mdash;<HI>that the moral rectitude and fitne&s;s of the di&s;po&s;ition, inclination or affection of God's heart, does chiefly con|&s;i&s;t in a re&s;pect or regard to him&s;elf infinitely above his regard to all other beings:</HI> Or in other words, his holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in this.</P>
<P>AND if it be thus fit that God &s;hou'd have a &s;upreme re|gard to him&s;elf, then it is fit that this &s;upreme regard &s;hou'd appear, in tho&s;e things by which he makes him&s;elf known,
<PB N="15" REF="009962_0021_0F7B3D152DDC91F0">
or by his <HI>word</HI> and <HI>works;</HI> i. e. in what he &s;ays, and in what he does. If it be an infinitely amiable thing in God, that he &s;hould have a &s;upreme regard to him&s;elf, then it is an amiable thing that he &s;hou'd act as having a chief regard to him&s;elf; or act in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;hew that he has &s;uch a re|gard; that what is highe&s;t in God's heart, may be highe&s;t in his actions and conduct. And if it was God's intention, as there is great rea&s;on to think it was, that his works &s;hould exhibit an image of him&s;elf their author, that it might bright|ly appear by his works what manner of being he is, and afford a proper repre&s;entation of his divine excellencies, and e&s;pecially his <HI>moral</HI> excellence, con&s;i&s;ting in the <HI>di&s;po&s;ition of his heart;</HI> then 'tis rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that his works are &s;o wrought as to &s;hew this &s;upreme re&s;pect to him&s;elf, where|in his moral excellency does primarily con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEN we are con&s;idering with our&s;elves, what would be mo&s;t fit and proper for God to have a chief re&s;pect to, in his proceedings in general, with regard to the univer&s;ality of things, it may help us to judge of the matter with the grea|ter ea&s;e &amp; &s;atisfaction to con&s;ider, what we can &s;uppo&s;e would be judged and determined by &s;ome third being of perfect wi&s;|dom and rectitude, neither the creator nor one of the crea|tures, that &s;hou'd be perfectly indifferent and di&s;intere&s;ted. Or if we make the &s;uppo&s;ition, that wi&s;dom it&s;elf, or infinite|ly wi&s;e ju&s;tice and rectitude were a di&s;tinct di&s;intere&s;ted per|&s;on, who&s;e office it was to determine how things &s;hall be mo&s;t fitly and properly order'd in the whole &s;y&s;tem, or kingdom of exi&s;tence, including king and &s;ubjects, God and his crea|tures; and upon a view of the whole, to decide what re|gard &s;hould prevail and govern in all proceedings. Now &s;uch a judge in adju&s;ting the proper mea&s;ures and kinds of regard that every part of exi&s;tence is to have, would weigh things in an even balance; taking care, that greater, or more exi&s;tence &s;hould have a greater &s;hare than le&s;s, that a greater part of the whole &s;hould be more looked at and re|&s;pected, than the le&s;&s;er in proportion (other things being e|qual) to the mea&s;ure of exi&s;tence,&mdash;that the more excellent &s;hould be more regarded than the le&s;s excellent:&mdash;So that the <HI>degree of regard</HI> &s;hould always be in a <HI>proportion, com|pounded</HI> of the <HI>proportion</HI> of <HI>exi&s;tence,</HI> and <HI>proportion</HI> of <HI>excellence,</HI> or according to the degree of <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> con&s;ider'd

<HI>conjunctly.</HI>&mdash;Such an arbiter, in con&s;idering the &s;y&s;tem of cre|ated intelligent beings by it&s;elf, would determine, that the &s;y&s;tem in general, con&s;i&s;ting of many millions, was of greater importance, and worthy of a greater &s;hare of regard, than only one individual. For however con&s;iderable &s;ome of the individuals might be &s;o that they might be much greater and better, and have a greater &s;hare of the &s;um total of exi&s;tence and excellence than another individual, yet no one exceeds others &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to countervail all the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem.

And as the creator is infinite, and has all po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence, perfection and excellence, &s;o he mu&s;t have all po&s;&s;ible regard. As he is every way the fir&s;t and &s;upreme, and as his excel|lency is in all re&s;pects the &s;upreme beauty and glory, the original good, and fountain of all good; &s;o he mu&s;t have in all re&s;pects the &s;upreme regard. And as he is God over all, to whom all are properly &s;ubordinate, and on whom all depend, worthy to reign as &s;upreme head with ab&s;olute and univer&s;al dominion; &s;o it is fit that he &s;hou'd be &s;o regarded by all &amp; in all proceedings &amp; effects thro' the whole &s;y&s;tem: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat this univer&s;ality of things in their whole compa&s;s and

<P>WHEN I &s;peak of regard to be thus adju&s;ted in the uni|ver&s;al &s;y&s;tem, or &s;um total of exi&s;tence, I mean the regard of the &s;um total; not only the regard of individual creatures, or all creatures, but of all intelligent exi&s;tence, created, and un|created. For 'tis fit, that the regard of the creator &s;hould be proportioned to the worthine&s;s of objects, as well as the regard of creatures. Thus we mu&s;t conclude &s;uch an arbi|ter, as I have &s;uppo&s;ed, would determine in this bu&s;ine&s;s, be|ing about to decide how matters &s;hould proceed mo&s;t fitly, properly, and according to the nature of things. He would therefore determine, that the whole univer&s;e, including all creatures animate and inanimate, in all it's actings, proceed|ings, revolutions, and entire &s;eries of events, &s;hould proceed from a regard and with a view, to <HI>God,</HI> as the &s;upream and la&s;t end of all: That every wheel, both great and &s;mall, in all it's rotations, &s;hou'd move with a con&s;tant in|variable regard to him as the ultimate end of all; as per|fectly and uniformly, as if the whole &s;y&s;tem were animated and directed by one common &s;oul: Or, as if &s;uch an ar|biter as I have before &s;uppo&s;ed, one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of perfect wi&s;dom and rectitude, became the common &s;oul of the uni|ver&s;e, and actuated and governed it in all it's motions.</P>
<P>THUS I have gone upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of a third per|&s;on, neither creator nor creature, but a di&s;intere&s;ted per&s;on &s;tepping in to judge of the concerns of both, and &s;tate what is mo&s;t fit and proper between them. The thing &s;up|po&s;ed is impo&s;&s;ible; but the ca&s;e is neverthele&s;s ju&s;t the &s;ame as to what is mo&s;t fit and &s;uitable in it&s;elf. For it is mo&s;t certainly proper for God to act, according to the greate&s;t <HI>fitne&s;s,</HI> in his proceedings, and he knows what the greate&s;t <HI>fitne&s;s</HI> is, as much as if perfect rectitude were a di&s;tinct per|&s;on to direct him. As therefore there is no third being, be&s;ide God and the created &s;y&s;tem, nor can be, &s;o there is no need of any, &s;eeing God him&s;elf is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that perfect di&s;|cernment and rectitude which have been &s;uppo&s;ed. It be|longs to him as &s;upream arbiter, and to his infinite wi&s;dom
<PB N="18" REF="009962_0024_0F7B3D16F1DA0A08">
and rectitude, to &s;tate all rules and mea&s;ures of proceedings. And &s;eeing the&s;e attributes of God are infinite, and mo&s;t ab|&s;olutely perfect, they are not the le&s;s fit to order and di&s;po&s;e, becau&s;e they are in him, who is a being concern'd, and not a third per&s;on that is di&s;intere&s;ted.&mdash;For being intere&s;ted unfits a per&s;on to be an arbiter or judge, no otherwi&s;e than as intere&s;t tends to blind &amp; mi&s;lead his judgment, or incline him to act contrary to it. But that God &s;hould be in danger of either, is contrary to the &s;uppo&s;ition of his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of di&s;cerning and ju&s;tice ab&s;olutely perfect. And as there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;upream judge of fitne&s;s and propriety in the uni|ver&s;ality of things, as otherwi&s;e there could be no order nor regularity, it therefore belongs to God who&s;e are all things, who is perfectly fit for this office, and who alone is &s;o to &s;tate all things according to the mo&s;t perfect fitne&s;s and rectitude, as much as if perfect rectitude were a di&s;tinct per&s;on. We may therefore be &s;ure it is and will be done.</P>
<P>I SHOULD think that the&s;e things might incline us to &s;up|po&s;e, that God has not forgot him&s;elf, in the ends which he propo&s;ed in the creation of the world; but that he has &s;o &s;tated the&s;e ends (however he is &s;elf-&s;ufficient, immutable, and independent) as therein plainly to &s;hew a &s;upreme regard to him&s;elf. Whether this can be, or whether God has done thus, mu&s;t be con&s;idered afterwards, as al&s;o what may be objected again&s;t this view of things.</P>
<P N="5">5. WHATSOEVER is good, amiable and valuable in it&s;elf, ab&s;olutely and originally, which facts and events &s;hew that God aimed at in the creation of the world, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be regarded, or aimed at by God <HI>ultimately,</HI> or as an ulti|mate end of creation.&mdash;For we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e from the per|fection of God's nature, that what&s;oever is valuable and ami|able in it&s;elf, &s;imply and ab&s;olutely con&s;idered, God values &s;imply for it&s;elf; 'tis agreable to him ab&s;olutely on it's own account; becau&s;e God's judgment and e&s;teem are according to truth. He values and loves things accordingly, as they are worthy to be valued and loved. But if God values a thing &s;imply, and ab&s;olutely, for it&s;elf, and on it's own ac|count, then 'tis the ultimate object of his value; he don't value it merely for the &s;ake of a further end to be attained by it. For to &s;uppo&s;e that he values it only for &s;ome farther end,
<PB N="19" REF="009962_0025_0F7B3D178DFC0848">
is in direct contradiction to the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, which is, that he values it ab&s;olutely, and for it&s;elf.&mdash;Hence it mo&s;t clearly follows, that if that which God values ultimately, and for it&s;elf, appears in fact and experience, to be what he &s;eeks by any thing he does, he mu&s;t regard it as an ultimate end. And therefore if he &s;eeks it in creating the world, or any part of the world, 'tis an ultimate end of the work of creation.&mdash;Having got thus far, we may now proceed a &s;tep farther, and a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P N="6">6. WHATSOEVER thing is actually the effect or con&s;e|quence of the creation of the world, which is &s;imply and ab|&s;olutely good and valuable in it&s;elf, that thing is an ultimate end of God's creating the world.&mdash;We &s;ee that it is a good that God aimed at by the creation of the world; becau&s;e he has actually attained it by that means. This is an evidence that he intended to attain, or aimed at it. For we may ju&s;tly infer what God intends, by what he actually does; becau&s;e he does nothing inadvertently, or without de&s;ign. But what|ever God intends to attain from a value for it; or in other words, whatever he aims at in his actions and works, that he values; he &s;eeks that thing in tho&s;e acts and works. Be|cau&s;e, for an agent to intend to attain &s;omething he values by means he u&s;es, is the &s;ame thing as to &s;eek it by tho&s;e means. And this is the &s;ame as to make that thing his end in tho&s;e means. Now it being by the &s;uppo&s;ition what God values ultimately, it mu&s;t therefore by the preceeding po&s;iti|on, be aimed at by God as an ultimate end of creating the world.</P>

<P>Some farther ob&s;ervations concerning tho&s;e things which rea&s;on leads us to &s;uppo&s;e God aimed at in the creation of the world, &s;hewing particularly what things that are ab&s;olutely good, are actually the con&s;equence of the creation of the world.</P>

And this is what I would directly proceed to, without entring on any tedious metaphy|&s;ical enquiries wherein fitne&s;s, amiablene&s;s, or valuablene&s;s con&s;i&s;ts; or what that is in the nature of &s;ome things, which is properly the foundation of a worthine&s;s of being loved and e&s;teemed on their own account.

<P N="1">1. IT &s;eems a thing in it&s;elf fit, proper and de&s;irable, that the glorious attributes of God, which con&s;i&s;t in a &s;ufficiency to certain acts and effects, &s;hould be exerted in the producti|on of &s;uch effects, as might manife&s;t the infinite power, wi&s;|dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, goodne&s;s, &amp;c. which are in God. If the world had not been created, the&s;e attributes never would have had any exerci&s;e. The power of God, which is a &s;ufficiency in him to produce great effects, mu&s;t for ever have been dor|mant and u&s;ele&s;s as to any effect. The divine wi&s;dom and prudence would have had no exerci&s;e in any wi&s;e contrivance, any prudent proceeding or di&s;po&s;al of things; for there would have been no objects of contrivance or di&s;po&s;al. The &s;ame might be ob&s;erved of God's ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s and truth.&mdash;Indeed God might have known as perfectly that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the&s;e attributes, if they had never been exerted or expre&s;&s;ed in any effect. But then if the attributes which con&s;i&s;t in a &s;ufficiency for corre&s;pondent effects, are in them&s;elves excel|lent, the exerci&s;es of them mu&s;t likewi&s;e be excellent. If it be an excellent thing that there &s;hould be a &s;ufficiency for a cer|tain kind of action or operation, the excellency of &s;uch a &s;uffi|ciency mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in it's relation to this kind of operation or effect; but that could not be, unle&s;s the operation it&s;elf were excellent. A &s;ufficiency for any act or work is no farther valuable, than the work or effect is valuable.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As we mu&s;t conceive of things, the end and perfection of the&s;e attributes does as it were con&s;i&s;t in their exerci&s;e: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> The end of wi&s;dom (&s;ays Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in his Sermon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the opening of the pre&s;byterian church of Philadelphia) is de&s;ign; the end of power is action; the end of goodne&s;s is doing good.

<P N="2">2. IT &s;eems to be a thing in it&s;elf fit and de&s;irable, that the glorious perfections of God &s;hould be known, and the ope|rations and expre&s;&s;ions of them &s;een by other beings be&s;ides him&s;elf. If it be fit, that God's power and wi&s;dom, &amp;c. &s;hould be exerci&s;ed and expre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome effects, and not lie eternally dormant, then it &s;eems proper that the&s;e exerci&s;es &s;hould appear, and not be totally hidden and unknown. For if they are, it will be ju&s;t the &s;ame as to the above purpo&s;e, as if they were not. God as perfectly knew him&s;elf and his per|fections, had as perfect an idea of the exerci&s;es and effects they were &s;ufficient for, antecedently to any &s;uch actual op|erations of them, as &s;ince. If therefore it be neverthele&s;s a thing in it&s;elf valuable, and worthy to be de&s;ired, that the&s;e glorious perfections be actually expre&s;&s;ed and exhibited in their corre&s;pondent effects; then it &s;eems al&s;o, that the know|ledge of the&s;e perfections, and the expre&s;&s;ions and di&s;coveries that are made of them, is a thing valuable in it&s;elf ab&s;olutely con&s;idered; and that 'tis de&s;irable that this knowledge &s;hould exi&s;t. As God's perfections are things in them&s;elves excel|lent, &s;o the expre&s;&s;ion of them in their proper acts and fruits is excellent; and the knowledge of the&s;e excellent perfecti|ons, and of the&s;e glorious expre&s;&s;ions of them, is an excellent thing, the exi&s;tence of which is in it&s;elf valuable and de&s;ira|ble.&mdash;'Tis a thing infinitely good in it&s;elf that God's glory &s;hould be known by a glorious &s;ociety of created beings.
<PB N="22" REF="009962_0028_0F7B3D19E3ABA338">
And that there &s;hould be in them an increa&s;ing knowledge of God to all eternity, is an exi&s;tence, a reality infinitely worthy to be, and worthy to be valued and regarded by him, to whom it belongs to order that to be, which, of all things po&s;&s;ible, is fitte&s;t &amp; be&s;t. If exi&s;tence is more worthy than defect and non-entity, and if any created exi&s;tence is in it&s;elf worthy to be, then knowledge or under&s;tanding is a thing worthy to be; and if any knowledge, then the mo&s;t excellent &s;ort of knowledge, viz. that of God and his glory. The exi&s;tence of the created univer&s;e con&s;i&s;ts as much in it as in any thing: Yea this knowledge, is one of the highe&s;t, mo&s;t real and &s;ub|&s;tantial parts, of all created exi&s;tence, mo&s;t remote from non-entity and defect.</P>
<P N="3">3. As it is a thing valuable and de&s;irable in it&s;elf that God's glory &s;hould be &s;een and known, &s;o when known, it &s;eems equally rea&s;onable and fit, it &s;hould be valued and e&s;teemed, loved and delighted in, an&s;werably to it's dignity. There is no more rea&s;on to e&s;teem it a fit and &s;uitable thing that God's glory &s;hould be known, or that there &s;hould be an idea in the under&s;tanding corre&s;ponding unto the glorious object, than that there &s;hould be a corre&s;ponding di&s;po&s;ition or affection in the will. If the perfection it&s;elf be excellent, the knowledge of it is excellent, and &s;o is the e&s;teem and love of it excellent. And as 'tis fit that God &s;hould love and e&s;teem his own excellence, 'tis al&s;o fit that he &s;hould value and e&s;teem the love of his excellency. For if it becomes any being greatly to value another, then it becomes him to love to have him valued and e&s;teemed: And if it becomes a being highly to value him&s;elf, it is fit that he &s;hould love to have him&s;elf valued and e&s;teemed. If the idea of God's perfection in the under&s;tanding be valuable, then the love of the heart &s;eems to be more e&s;pecially valuable, as moral beauty e&s;peci|ally con&s;i&s;ts in the di&s;po&s;ition and affection of the heart.</P>
<P N="4">4. As there is an infinite fulne&s;s of all po&s;&s;ible good in God, a fulne&s;s of every perfection, of all excellency and beau|ty, and of infinite happine&s;s. And as this fulne&s;s is capable of communication or emanation <HI>ad extra;</HI> &s;o it &s;eems a thing amiable and valuable in it&s;elf that it &s;hould be communicated or flow forth, that this infinite fountain of good &s;hould &s;end forth abundant &s;treams, that this infinite fountain of light
<PB N="23" REF="009962_0029_0F7B3D1BCF2DA690">
&s;hould, diffu&s;ing it's excellent fulne&s;s, pour forth light all around.&mdash;And as this is in it&s;elf excellent, &s;o a di&s;po&s;ition to this, in the divine being, mu&s;t be looked upon as a perfecti|on or an excellent di&s;po&s;ition, &s;uch an emanation of good is, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, a multiplication of it; &s;o far as the commu|nication or external &s;tream may be looked upon as any thing be&s;ides the fountain, &s;o far it may be looked on as an increa&s;e of good. And if the fulne&s;s of good that is in the fountain, is in it&s;elf excellent and worthy to exi&s;t, then the emanation, or that which is as it were an increa&s;e, repetition or multi|plication of it, is excellent and worthy to exi&s;t. Thus it is fit, &s;ince there is an infinite fountain of light and knowledge, that this light &s;hould &s;hine forth in beams of communicated knowledge and under&s;tanding: And as there is an infinite fountain of holine&s;s, moral excellence and beauty, &s;o it &s;hould flow out in communicated holine&s;s.&mdash;And that as there is an infinite fulne&s;s of joy and happine&s;s, &s;o the&s;e &s;hould have an emanation, and become a fountain flowing out in abundant &s;treams, as beams from the &s;un.</P>
<P>FROM this view it appears another way to be a thing in it&s;elf valuable, that there &s;hould be &s;uch things as the know|ledge of God's glory in other beings, and an high e&s;teem of it, love to it, and delight and complacence in it: This ap|pears I &s;ay in another way, viz. as the&s;e things are but the emanations of God's own knowledge, holine&s;s and joy.</P>
<P>THUS it appears rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that it was what God had re&s;pect to as an ultimate end of his creating the world, to communicate of his own infinite fulne&s;s of good; or rather it was his la&s;t end, that there might be a glorious and abundant emanation of his infinite fulne&s;s of Good <HI>ad extra,</HI> or without him&s;elf, and the di&s;po&s;ition to communicate him|&s;elf, or diffu&s;e his own FULNESS,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall often u&s;e the phra&s;e <HI>God's fulne&s;s,</HI> as &s;ignifying and com|prehending all the good which is in God natural and moral, either excellence or happine&s;s: partly becau&s;e I know of no better phra&s;e to be u&s;ed in this general meaning; and partly becau&s;e I am led hereto by &s;ome of the in&s;pired writers, par|ticularly the apo&s;tle Paul, who often u&s;eth the phra&s;e in this &s;en&s;e.</NOTE> which we mu&s;t conceive

For tho' the diffu&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition in the nature of God, that moved him to create the world, doubtle&s;s inclines him to communicate him&s;elf to the creature, when the creature ex|i&s;ts; yet this can't be all: Becau&s;e an inclination in God to communicate him&s;elf to an object, &s;eems to pre&s;uppo&s;e the exi&s;tence of the object, at lea&s;t in idea. But the diffu&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition that excited God to give creatures exi&s;tence, was rather a communicative di&s;po&s;ition in general, or a di&s;po&s;ition in the fulne&s;s of the divinity to flow out and diffu&s;e it&s;elf. Thus the di&s;po&s;ition there is in the root and &s;tock of a tree to diffu&s;e and &s;end forth it's &s;ap and life, is doubtle&s;s the rea|&s;on of the communication of it's &s;ap and life to it's buds, leaves and fruits, after the&s;e exi&s;t. But a di&s;po&s;ition to com|municate of it's life and &s;ap to it's fruits, is not &s;o properly the cau&s;e of it's producing tho&s;e fruits, as it's di&s;po&s;ition to communicate it&s;elf, or diffu&s;e it's &s;ap and life in general. Therefore to &s;peak more &s;trictly according to truth, we may &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>that a di&s;po&s;ition in God, as an original property of his nature, to an emanation of his own infinite fulne&s;s, was what ex|cited him to create the world; and &s;o that the emanation it&s;elf was aimed at by him as a la&s;t end of the creation.</HI></P>

<P>WHerein it is con&s;idered <HI>how,</HI> on the &s;uppo&s;ition of God's making the forementioned things his la&s;t end, he manife&s;ts a &s;upreme and ultimate regard to him|&s;elf in all his works.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t &s;ection I ob&s;erved &s;ome things, which are actu|ally the con&s;equence of the creation of the world, which &s;eem ab&s;olutely valuable in them&s;elves, and &s;o worthy to be made God's la&s;t end in this work. I now proceed to enquire, how God's making &s;uch things as the&s;e his la&s;t end is con&s;i&s;tent with his making him&s;elf his la&s;t end, or his manife&s;ting an ultimate re&s;pect to him&s;elf in his acts and works. Becau&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="009962_0031_0F7B3D1D2F37E400">
this is a thing I have ob&s;erved as agreable to the dictates of rea&s;on, that in all his proceedings he &s;hould &s;et him&s;elf high|e&s;t.&mdash;Therefore I would endeavour to &s;hew with re&s;pect to each of the forementioned things, 'that God, in making them his end, makes him&s;elf his end, &s;o as in all to &s;hew a &s;upreme and ultimate re&s;pect to him&s;elf; and how his infinite love to him&s;elf and delight in him&s;elf, will naturally cau&s;e him to va|lue and delight in the&s;e things: Or rather how a value to the&s;e things is implied in his love to him&s;elf, or value of that infinite fulne&s;s of good that is in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now with regard to the fir&s;t of the particulars mention'd above, viz. God's regard to the exerci&s;e and expre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e attributes of his nature, in their proper operations and effects, which con&s;i&s;t in a &s;ufficiency for the&s;e operations, 'tis not hard to conceive that God's regard to him&s;elf, and value for his own perfections, &s;hould cau&s;e him to value the&s;e exerci&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions of his perfections; and that a love to them will di&s;po&s;e him to love their exhibition and exert|ment: Inasmuch as their excellency con&s;i&s;ts in their relation to u&s;e, exerci&s;e and operation; as the excellency of wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in it's relation to, and &s;ufficiency for, wi&s;e de&s;igns and effects. God's love to him&s;elf, and his own attributes, will therefore make him delight in that, which is the u&s;e, end and operation of the&s;e attributes. If one highly e&s;teem and delight in the virtues of a friend, as wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, &amp;c. that have relation to action, this will make him delight in the ex|erci&s;e and genuine effects of the&s;e virtues: So if God both e&s;teem, and delight in his own perfections and virtues, he can't but value and delight in the expre&s;&s;ions and genuine effects of them. So that in delighting in the expre&s;&s;ions of his perfections, he manife&s;ts a delight in his own perfections them&s;elves: Or in other words, he manife&s;ts a delight in him&s;elf; and in making the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of his own per|fections his end, <HI>he makes him&s;elf his end.</HI></P>
<P>AND with re&s;pect to the &s;econd and third particulars, the matter is no le&s;s plain. For he that loves any being, and has a di&s;po&s;ition highly to prize, and greatly to delight in his virtues and perfections, mu&s;t from the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition be well plea&s;ed to have his excellencies known, acknowledged, e|&s;teemed and prized by others. He that loves and approves
<PB N="26" REF="009962_0032_0F7B3D1D83247950">
any being or thing, he naturally loves and approves the love and approbation of that thing, and is oppo&s;ite to the di&s;ap|probation and contempt of it. Thus it is when one loves another, and highly prizes the virtues of a friend. And thus it is fit it &s;hould be, if it be fit that the other &s;hould be beloved, and his qualification priz'd. And therefore thus it will ne|ce&s;&s;arily be, if a being loves him&s;elf and highly prizes his own excellencies: And thus it is fit it &s;hould be, if it be fit he &s;hould thus love him&s;elf, and prize his own valuable qualities. That is, 'tis fit that he &s;hould take delight in his own excel|lencies being &s;een, acknowledged, e&s;teemed, and delighted in. This is implied in a love to him&s;elf and his own perfections. And in &s;eeking this, and making this his end, he &s;eeks him|&s;elf, and makes him&s;elf his end.</P>
<P>AND with re&s;pect to the fourth and la&s;t particular, viz. God's being di&s;po&s;ed to an abundant communication, and glorious emanation of that infinite fulne&s;s of good which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in him&s;elf; as of his own knowledge, excellency, and happine&s;s, in the manner which he does; if we thoro'ly and properly con&s;ider the matter, it will appear, that herein al&s;o God makes him&s;elf his end, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as plainly to manife&s;t and te&s;tify a &s;upreme and ultimate regard to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>MEERLY in this di&s;po&s;ition to diffu&s;e him&s;elf, or to cau&s;e an emanation of his glory and fulne&s;s, which is prior to the exi&s;tence of any other being, and is to be con&s;ider'd as the inciting cau&s;e of creation, or giving exi&s;tence to other beings, God can't &s;o properly be &s;aid to make the creature his end, as him&s;elf.&mdash;For the creature is not as yet con&s;ider|ed as exi&s;ting. This di&s;po&s;ition or de&s;ire in God, mu&s;t be prior to the exi&s;tence of the creature, even in intention and fore&s;ight. For it is a di&s;po&s;ition that is the original ground of the exi&s;tence of the creature; and even of the future in|tended and fore&s;een exi&s;tence of the creature.&mdash;God's love, or benevolence, as it re&s;pects the creature, may be ta|ken either in a larger, or &s;tricter &s;en&s;e. In a larger &s;en&s;e it may &s;ignify nothing diver&s;e from that good di&s;po&s;ition in his na|ture to communicate of his own fulne&s;s in general; as his knowledge, his holine&s;s, and happine&s;s; and to give crea|tures exi&s;tence in order to it. This may be called benevo|lence
<PB N="27" REF="009962_0033_0F7B3D1E76C0B170">
or love, becau&s;e it is the &s;ame good di&s;po&s;ition that is exerci&s;ed in love: 'Tis the very fountain from whence love originally proceeds, when taken in the mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e; and it has the &s;ame general tendency and effect in the crea|ture's well-being.&mdash;But yet this can't have any particular pre&s;ent or future created exi&s;tence for its object; becau&s;e it is prior to any &s;uch object, and the very &s;ource of the fu|turition of the exi&s;tence of it. Nor is it really diver&s;e from God's love to him&s;elf; as will more clearly appear after|wards.</P>
<P>BUT God's love may be taken more &s;trictly, for this ge|neral di&s;po&s;ition to communicate good, as directed to par|ticular objects: Love in the mo&s;t &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e, pre&s;uppo&s;es the exi&s;tence of the object beloved, at lea&s;t in idea and expectation, and repre&s;ented to the mind as future. God did not love angels in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, but in con&s;e|quence of his intending to create them, and &s;o having an idea of future exi&s;ting angels. Therefore his love to them was not properly what excited him to intend to create them. Love or benevolence &s;trictly taken, pre&s;uppo&s;es an exi&s;ting object, as much as pity, a mi&s;erable &s;uffering object.</P>
<P>THIS propen&s;ity in God to diffu&s;e him&s;elf, may be con&s;i|der'd as a propen&s;ity to him&s;elf diffu&s;ed; or to his own glo|ry exi&s;ting in its emanation. A re&s;pect to him&s;elf, or an infinite propen&s;ity to, and delight in his own glory, is that which cau&s;es him to incline to its being abundantly diffu&s;ed, and to delight in the emanation of it. Thus that nature in a tree, by which it puts forth buds, &s;hoots out branches, and brings forth leaves and fruit, is a di&s;po&s;ition that termi|nates in its own compleat &s;elf. And &s;o the di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;un to &s;hine, or abundantly to diffu&s;e its fulne&s;s, warmth and brightne&s;s, is only a tendency to its own mo&s;t glorious and compleat &s;tate. So God looks on the communication of him&s;elf, and the emanation of the infinite glory and good that are in him&s;elf to belong to the fulne&s;s and compleat|ne&s;s of him&s;elf; as tho' he were not in his mo&s;t compleat and glorious &s;tate without it. Thus the church of Chri&s;t (toward whom, and in whom are the emanations of his glory and communications of his fulne&s;s) is called the ful|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t: As tho' he were not in his compleat &s;tate
<PB N="28" REF="009962_0034_0F7B3D2105E362A0">
without her; as Adam was in a defective &s;tate without Eve. And the church is call'd the glory of Chri&s;t, as the woman is the glory of the man, I Cor. xi. 7.&mdash;I&s;ai. xlvi. 13. I will place &s;alvation in Zion, for I&s;rael <HI>my glory.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Very remarkable is that place, Joh. xii. 23, 24. "And Je&s;us an|&s;wered them &s;aying: the hour is come that the &s;on of man &s;hould be glorified. Verily I &s;ay unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit." He had re&s;pect herein, to the ble&s;&s;ed fruits of Chri&s;t's death, in the conver&s;ion, &s;alvation, and eternal happine&s;s and holine&s;s of tho&s;e that &s;hould be redeemed by him. This con&s;equence of his death, he calls his glory; and his obtaining this fruit he calls his being glorified: As the flouri&s;hing beautiful produce of a corn of wheat &s;own in the ground is its glory. Without this he is alone as Adam was be|fore Eve was created: But from him by his death proceeds a glorious offspring; in which he is communicated, that is his fulne&s;s and glory: As from Adam in his deep &s;leep proceeds the woman a beautiful companion to fill his emptine&s;s, and re|lieve his &s;olitarine&s;s. By Chri&s;t's death, his fulne&s;s is abundant|ly diffu&s;ed in many &s;treams; and expre&s;&s;ed in the beauty and glory of a great multitude of his &s;piritual offspring.</NOTE>&mdash;Indeed after the creatures are intended to be created, God may be con|ceiv'd of as being moved by benevolence to the&s;e creatures, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, in his dealings with, and works about them. His exerci&s;ing his goodne&s;s, and gratifying his be|nevolence to them in particular, may be the &s;pring of all God's proceedings thro' the univer&s;e; as being now the de|termin'd way of gratifying his general inclination to diffu&s;e him&s;elf. Here God's acting for him&s;elf, or making him&s;elf his la&s;t end, and his acting for their &s;ake, are not to be &s;et in oppo&s;ition; or to be con&s;idered as the oppo&s;ite parts of a disjunction: They are rather to be con&s;idered as coinciding one with the other, and implied one in the other. But yet God is to be con&s;idered as fir&s;t and original in his regard; and the creature is the object of God's regard con&s;equenti|ally and by implication as being as it were comprehended in God; as &s;hall be more particularly ob&s;erv'd pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>BUT how God's value for and delight in the emanations of his fulne&s;s in the work of creation, argues his delight in the infinite fulne&s;s of good there is in him&s;elf, and the &s;u|preme
<PB N="29" REF="009962_0035_0F7B3D2237D9DDE8">
re&s;pect and regard he has for him&s;elf; and that in making the&s;e emanations of him&s;elf his end, he does ulti|mately make him&s;elf his end in creation, will more clearly appear by con&s;idering more particularly the nature and cir|cum&s;tances of the&s;e communications of God's fulne&s;s which are made, and which we have rea&s;on either from the nature of things, or the word of God to &s;uppo&s;e &s;hall be made.</P>
<P>ONE part of that divine fulne&s;s which is communicated, is the-divine knowledge. That communicated knowledge which mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to pertain to God's la&s;t end in cre|ating the world, is the creatures knowledge of him. For this is the end of all other knowledge: And even the fa|culty of under&s;tanding would be vain without this. And this knowledge is mo&s;t properly a communication of God's infinite knowledge which primarily con&s;i&s;ts in the know|ledge of him&s;elf. God in making this his end, makes him|&s;elf his end. This knowledge in the creature, is but a conformity to God. 'Tis the image of God's own know|ledge of him&s;elf. 'Tis a participation of the &s;ame: 'Tis as much the &s;ame as 'tis po&s;&s;ible for that to be, which is infi|nitely le&s;s in degree: As particular beams of the &s;un com|municated, are the light and glory of the &s;un in part.</P>
<P>BESIDES God's perfections, or his glory, is the object of this knowledge, or the thing known; &s;o that God is glo|rified in it, as hereby his excellency is &s;een. As therefore God values him&s;elf, as he delights in his own knowledge; he mu&s;t delight in every thing of that nature: As he de|lights in his own light, he mu&s;t delight in every beam of that light: And as he highly values his own excellency, he mu&s;t be well plea&s;ed in having it manife&s;ted, and &s;o glorified.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing wherein the emanation of divine fulne&s;s that is, and will be made in con&s;equence of the creation of the world, is the communication of virtue and holine&s;s to the creature. This is a communication of God's holine&s;s; &s;o that hereby the creature partakes of God's own moral excellency; which is properly the beauty of the divine nature. And as God delights in his own beauty, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily delight in the creatures holine&s;s; which is a
<PB N="30" REF="009962_0036_0F7B3D22C9994E50">
conformity to, and participation of it, as truly as the bright|ne&s;s of a jewel, held in the &s;un's beams, is a participation, or derivation of the &s;un's brightne&s;s, tho' immen&s;ly le&s;s in degree.&mdash;And then it mu&s;t be con&s;idered wherein this holine&s;s in the creature con&s;i&s;ts; viz. in love, which is the comprehen&s;ion of all true virtue; and primarily in love to God, which is exerci&s;ed in an high e&s;teem of God, admira|tion of his perfections, complacency in them, and prai&s;e of them. All which things are nothing el&s;e but the hearts exalting, magnifying, or glorifying God; which as I &s;hew'd before, God nece&s;&s;arily approves of, and is plea&s;ed with, as he loves him&s;elf, and values the glory of his own nature.</P>
<P>ANOTHER part of God's fulne&s;s which he communicates, is his happine&s;s. This happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in enjoying and rejoicing in him&s;elf: And &s;o does al&s;o the creatures hap|pine&s;s. 'Tis, as has been ob&s;erved of the other, a partici|pation of what is in God; and God and his glory are the objective ground of it. The happine&s;s of the creature con|&s;i&s;ts in rejoicing in God; by which al&s;o God is magnified and exalted: Joy, or the exulting of the heart in God's glo|ry, is one thing that belongs to prai&s;e.&mdash;So that God is all in all, with re&s;pect to each part of that communication of the divine fulne&s;s which is made to the creature. What is communicated is divine, or &s;omething of God: And each communication is of that nature, that the creature to whom it is made, is thereby conform'd to God, and united to him; and that in proportion as the communication is greater or le&s;s. And the communication it&s;elf, is no other, in the very nature of it, than that wherein the very honor, exaltation and prai&s;e of God con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>AND 'tis farther to be con&s;idered, that the thing which God aimed at in the creation of the world, as the end which he had ultimately in view, was that communication of him|&s;elf, which he intended throughout all eternity. And if we attend to the nature and circum&s;tances of this eternal e|manation of divine good, it will more clearly &s;hew how in making this his end, God te&s;tifies a &s;upreme re&s;pect to him|&s;elf, and makes him&s;elf his end. There are many rea&s;ons to think that what God has in view, in an increa&s;ing com|munication of him&s;elf throughout eternity, is an increa&s;ing
<PB N="31" REF="009962_0037_0F7B3D2381BBD900">
knowledge of God, love to him, and joy in him.&mdash;And 'tis to be con&s;ider'd that the more tho&s;e divine communica|tions increa&s;e in the creature, the more it becomes one with God: For &s;o much the more is it united to God in love, the heart is drawn nearer and nearer to God, and the union with him becomes more firm and clo&s;e: and at the &s;ame time the creature becomes more and more conform'd to God. The image is more and more perfect, and &s;o the good that is in the creature comes forever nearer and nearer to an identity with that which is in God. In the view therefore of God, who has a comprehen&s;ive pro&s;pect of the increa&s;ing union and conformity through eternity, it mu&s;t be an infi|nitely &s;trict and perfect nearne&s;s, conformity, and onene&s;s. For it will for ever come nearer and nearer to that &s;trictne&s;s and perfection of union which there is between the Father and the Son: So that in the eyes of God, who perfectly &s;ees the whole of it, in its infinite progre&s;s and increa&s;e, it mu&s;t come to an eminent fulfilment of Chri&s;t's reque&s;t, in Joh. xvii. 21, 23.&mdash;"That they all may be <HI>one,</HI> as thou father art in me, &amp; I in thee, that they al&s;o may be one in us, I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in <HI>one.</HI>" In this view, tho&s;e elect creatures which mu&s;t be looked upon as the end of all the re&s;t of the creation, con|&s;idered with re&s;pect to the whole of their eternal duration, and as &s;uch made God's end, mu&s;t be viewed as being, as it were, one with God. They were re&s;pected as brought home to him, united with him, centering mo&s;t perfectly in him, and as it were &s;wallowed up in him: &s;o that his re&s;pect to them finally coincides and becomes one and the &s;ame with re&s;pect to him&s;elf.&mdash;The intere&s;t of the creature, is, as it were, God's own intere&s;t, in proportion to the degree of their relation and union to God. Thus the intere&s;t of a man's family is look'd upon as the &s;ame with his own intere&s;t; becau&s;e of the relation they &s;tand in to him; his propriety in them, and their &s;trict union with him. But con&s;ider God's elect creatures with re&s;pect to their eternal duration, &s;o they are infinitely dearer to God, than a man's family is to him.&mdash;What has been &s;aid, &s;hews that as all things are from God as their fir&s;t cau&s;e and fountain; &s;o all things tend to him, and in their progre&s;s come nearer &amp; nearer to him through all eternity: which argues that he who is their fir&s;t cau&s;e is their la&s;t end.</P>

<P>Some objections con&s;idered which may be made again&s;t the rea&s;onablene&s;s of what has been &s;aid of God's making him&s;elf his la&s;t end.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. Some may object again&s;t what has been &s;aid, as incon&s;i&s;tent with God's ab&s;olute independence and im|mutability: particularly the repre&s;entation that has been made, as tho' God were inclined to a communication of his fulne&s;s and emanations of his own glory, as being his own mo&s;t glorious and compleat &s;tate. It may be tho't that this don't well con&s;i&s;t with God's being &s;elf-exi&s;tent from all eternity; ab&s;olutely perfect in him&s;elf, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of infinite and independent good. And that in general, to &s;uppo&s;e that God makes him&s;elf his end, in the creation of the world, &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e that he aims at &s;ome intere&s;t or happine&s;s of his own, not ea&s;ily reconcileable with his being happy, perfectly &amp; infinitely happy in him|&s;elf. If it could be &s;uppo&s;ed that God needed any thing; or that the goodne&s;s of his creatures could extend to him; or that they could be profitable to him; it might be fit, that God &s;hould make him&s;elf, and his own intere&s;t, his highe&s;t and la&s;t end in creating the world: and there would be &s;ome rea&s;on and ground for the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e. But &s;eeing that God is above all need and all capacity of being added to and advanced, made better or happier in any re&s;pect; to what purpo&s;e &s;hould God make him&s;elf his end; or &s;eek to advance him&s;elf in any re&s;pect by any of his works? How ab&s;urd is it to &s;uppo&s;e that God &s;hould do &s;uch great things with a view to obtain, what he is already mo&s;t perfectly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and was &s;o from all eternity; and therefore can't now po&s;&s;ibly need, nor with any colour of rea&s;on be &s;uppos'd to &s;eek?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer</HI> 1. MANY have wrong notions of God's happi|ne&s;s, as re&s;ulting from his ab&s;olute &s;elf-&s;ufficience, in|dependence, and immutability. Tho' it be true, that God's glory and happine&s;s are in and of him&s;elf, are infinite and can't be added to, unchangeable for the whole and every part of which he is perfectly independent of the creature;
<PB N="33" REF="009962_0039_0F7B3D25011C6898">
yet it don't hence follow, nor is it true, that God has no real and proper delight, plea&s;ure or happine&s;s, in any of his acts or communications relative to the creature; or effects he produces in them; or in any thing he &s;ees in the crea|tures qualifications, di&s;po&s;itions, actions and &s;tate. God may have a real and proper plea&s;ure or happine&s;s in &s;eeing the happy &s;tate of the creature: yet this may not be diffe|rent from his delight in him&s;elf; being a delight in his own infinite goodne&s;s; or the exerci&s;e of that glorious propen&s;ity of his nature to diffu&s;e and communicate him|&s;elf, and &s;o gratifying this inclination of his own heart.&mdash;This delight which God has in his creature's happine&s;s, can't properly be &s;aid to be what God receives from the creature. For 'tis only the effect of his own work in, and communications to the creature; in making it, and admit|ing it to a participation of his fulne&s;s. As the &s;un receives nothing from the jewel that receives its light, and &s;hines only by a participation of its brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect al&s;o to the creature's holine&s;s; God may have a proper delight and joy in imparting this to the crea|ture, as gratifying hereby his inclination, to communicate of his own excellent fulne&s;s. God may delight with true and great plea&s;ure in beholding that beauty which is an image and communication of his own beauty, an expre&s;&s;ion and manife&s;tation of his own loveline&s;s. And this is &s;o far from being an in&s;tance of his happine&s;s not being in and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">om him&s;elf, that 'tis an evidence that he is happy in him&s;elf, or delights and has plea&s;ure in his own beauty. If he did not take plea&s;ure in the expre&s;&s;ion of his own beauty, it would rather be an evidence that he don't delight in his own beau|ty; that he hath not his happine&s;s and enjoyment in his own beauty and perfection.&mdash;So that if we &s;uppo&s;e God has real plea&s;ure and happine&s;s in the holy love and prai&s;e of his &s;aints, as the image and communication of his own holine&s;s, it is not properly any plea&s;ure di&s;tinct from the plea&s;ure he has in him&s;elf; but is truly an in&s;tance of it.</P>
<P>AND with re&s;pect to God's being glorified in this re&s;pect, that tho&s;e perfections wherein his glory con&s;i&s;ts, are exer|ci&s;ed and expre&s;&s;ed in their proper and corre&s;ponding effects;

This is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of his delight|ing in the glory of his nature, that he delights in the ema|nation and effulgence of it.</P>
<P>NOR do any of the&s;e things argue any dependence in God on the creature for happine&s;s. Tho' he has real plea&s;ure in the creature's holine&s;s and happine&s;s; yet this is not properly any plea&s;ure which he receives from the creature. For the&s;e things are what he gives the creature. They are wholly and entirely from him. Therefore they are nothing that they give to God by which they add to him. His rejoycing therein, is rather a rejoicing in his own acts, and his own glory expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e acts, than a joy derived from the creature. God's joy is dependent on nothing be&s;ides his own act, which he exerts with an ab&s;o|lute and independent power. And yet, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e it can be truly &s;aid that God has the more delight and plea&s;ure for the holine&s;s and happine&s;s of his creatures. Becau&s;e God would be le&s;s happy, if he was le&s;s good: or if he had not that perfection of nature which con&s;i&s;ts in a pro|pen&s;ity of nature to diffu&s;e of his own fulne&s;s. And he would be le&s;s happy, if it were po&s;&s;ible for him to be hin|der'd in the exerci&s;e of his goodne&s;s, and his other per|fections in their proper effects. But he has compleat hap|pine&s;s, becau&s;e he has the&s;e perfections, and can't be hin|dred in exerci&s;ing and di&s;playing them in their proper effects. And this &s;urely is not thus, becau&s;e he is depen|dent; but becau&s;e he is independent on any other that &s;hould hinder him.</P>
<P>FROM this view it appears, that nothing that has been &s;aid is in the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in the Scripture that &s;ignify that man can't be profitable to God; that he receives nothing of us by any of our wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s. For the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions plainly mean no more
<PB N="35" REF="009962_0041_0F7B3D267A32C5F0">
than that God is ab&s;olutely independent of us; that we have nothing of our own, no &s;tock from whence we can give to God; and that no part of his happine&s;s originates from man.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid it appears, that the plea&s;ure that God hath in tho&s;e things which have been mentioned, is rather a plea&s;ure in diffu&s;ing and communicating to the creature, than in receiving from the creature. Surely, 'tis no argument of indigence in God, that he is inclined to communicate of his infinite fulne&s;s. 'Tis no argument of the emptine&s;s or deficiency of a fountain, that it is in|clined to overflow.&mdash;Another thing &s;ignified by the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions of &s;cripture is, that nothing that is from the crea|ture, adds to or alters God's happine&s;s, as tho' it were changeable either by encrea&s;e or diminution. Nor does any thing that has been advanced in the lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;e or infer that it does, or is it in the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent with the eternity, and mo&s;t ab&s;olute immutability of God's plea&s;ure and happine&s;s.&mdash;For tho' the&s;e communications of God, the&s;e exerci&s;es, operations, effects and expre&s;&s;ions of his glorious perfections, which God rejoyces in, are in time; yet his joy in them is without beginning or change. They were always equally pre&s;ent in the divine mind. He be|held them with equal clearne&s;s certainty and fulne&s;s in every re&s;pect, as he doth now. They were always equally pre&s;ent; as with him there is no variablene&s;s or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He ever beheld and enjoyed them perfectly in his own independent and immutable power and will. And his view of, and joy in them is eternally, ab&s;olutely perfect unchangeable and independent. It can't be added to or dimini&s;hed by the power or will of any creature: nor is in the lea&s;t depen|dent on any thing mutable or contingent.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF any are not &s;atisfyed with the preceeding an&s;wer, but &s;till in&s;i&s;t on the objection: let them con&s;ider whether they can devi&s;e any other &s;cheme of God's la&s;t end in creating the world, but what will be equally obnox|ious to this objection in its full force, if there be any force in it. For if God had any la&s;t end in creating the world, then there was &s;omething, in &s;ome re&s;pect future, that he aimed at, and de&s;ign'd to bring to pa&s;s by creat|ing
<PB N="36" REF="009962_0042_0F7B3D2859FCD8E8">
the world: &s;omething that was agreeable to his incli|nation or will: let that be his own glory, or the happi|ne&s;s of his creatures, or what it will. Now if there be &s;ome|thing that God &s;eeks as agreeable, or grateful to him, then in the accompli&s;hment of it he is gratifyed. If the la&s;t end which he &s;eeks in the creation of the world, be truly a thing grateful to him, (as certainly it is if it be truly his end and truly the object of his will) then it is what he takes a real delight and plea&s;ure in. But then ac|cording to the argument of the objection, how he can have any thing future to de&s;ire or &s;eek, who is already perfectly, eternally and immutably &s;atisfied in him&s;elf? What can remain for him to take any delight in or to be further gratifyed by, who&s;e eternal and unchangeable de|light is in him&s;elf as his own compleat object of enjoyment. Thus the objector will be pre&s;&s;ed with his own objection; let him embrace what notion he will of God's end in the creation. And I think he has no way left to an&s;wer but that which has been taken above.</P>
<P>IT may therefore be proper here to ob&s;erve, that let what will be God's la&s;t end, that, he mu&s;t have a real and proper plea&s;ure in: Whatever be the proper object of his will, he is gratified in. And the thing is either grateful to him in it&s;elf; or for &s;omething el&s;e for which he wills it: And &s;o is his further end. But whatever is God's la&s;t end, that he wills <HI>for it's own &s;ake;</HI> as grateful to him in it &s;elf: or which is the &s;ame thing; it is that which he truly delights in; or in which he has &s;ome degree of true and proper plea|&s;ure. Otherwi&s;e we mu&s;t deny any &s;uch thing as will in God with re&s;pect to any thing brought to pa&s;s in time; and &s;o mu&s;t deny his work of creation, or any work of his providence to be truly voluntary. But we have as much rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that God's works in creating and govern|ing the world, are properly the fruits of his will, as of his under&s;tanding. And if there be any &s;uch thing at all, as what we mean by <HI>acts of will</HI> in God; then he is not indifferent whether his will be fulfilled or not. And if he is not indifferent, then he is truly gratified and plea&s;ed in the fulfilment of his will: or which is the &s;ame thing, he has a plea&s;ure in it. And if he has a real plea&s;ure in at|taining his end, then the attainment of it belongs to his

happine&s;s. That in which God's delight or plea&s;ure in any mea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ts, his happine&s;s in &s;ome mea&s;ure con|&s;i&s;ts. To &s;uppo&s;e that God has plea&s;ure in things, that are brought to pa&s;s in time, only figuratively and meta|phorically; is to &s;uppo&s;e that he exerci&s;es will about the&s;e things, and makes them his end only metaphorically.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE doctrine that makes God's creatures and not him&s;elf, to be his la&s;t end, is a doctrine the farthe&s;t from having a favourable a&s;pect on God's ab&s;olute &s;elf-&s;ufficience and independence. It far le&s;s agrees therewith than the doc|trine again&s;t which this is objected. For we mu&s;t conceive of the efficient as depending on his ultimate end. He de|pends on this end, in his de&s;ires, aims, actions and pur&s;uits; &s;o that he fails in all his de&s;ires actions and pur&s;uits, if he fails of his end.&mdash;Now if God him&s;elf be his la&s;t end, then in his dependence on his end, he depends on nothing but him&s;elf. If all things be of him, and to him, and he the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, this &s;hews him to be all in all: He is all to him&s;elf. He goes not out of him&s;elf in what he &s;eeks; but his de&s;ires and pur&s;uits as they originate from, &s;o they terminate in him&s;elf; and he is dependent on none but him&s;elf in the beginning or end of any of his exerci&s;es or operations. But if not him&s;elf, but the creature, be his la&s;t end, then as he depends on his la&s;t end, he is in &s;ome &s;ort dependent on the creature.</P>
<P>Object. 2. SOME may object, that to &s;uppo&s;e that God makes him&s;elf his highe&s;t and la&s;t end, is di&s;honourable to him; as it in effect &s;uppo&s;es, that God does every thing from a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit. Selfi&s;hne&s;s is looked upon as mean and &s;ordid in the creature! unbecoming and even hateful in &s;uch a worm of the du&s;t as man. We &s;hould look upon a man as of a ba&s;e and contemptible character, that &s;hould in every thing he did, be governed by &s;elfi&s;h principles; &s;hould make his private intere&s;t his governing aim in all his conduct in life. How far then &s;hould we be from at|tributing any &s;uch thing to the &s;upream Being, the ble&s;&s;ed and only potentate! Does it not become us to a&s;cribe to him, the mo&s;t noble and generous di&s;po&s;itions; and tho&s;e qualities that are the mo&s;t remote from every thing that is private, narrow and &s;ordid?</P>

<HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. SUCH an objection mu&s;t ari&s;e from a very igno|rant or incon&s;iderate notion of the vice of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and the virtue of genero&s;ity. It by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s be meant, a di&s;|po&s;ition in any being to regard him&s;elf; this is no otherwi&s;e vicious or unbecoming, than as one is le&s;s than a multi|tude; and &s;o the public weal is of greater value than his particular intere&s;t.

But it is vicious on no other account, than as it is a di&s;po&s;ition that don't agree with the nature of things; and that which is indeed the greate&s;t good. And a di&s;po&s;ition in any one to forego his own in|tere&s;t for the &s;ake of others, is no further excellent, no fur|ther worthy the name of genero&s;ity than it is a treating things according to their true value; a pro&s;ecuting &s;ome|thing mo&s;t worthy to be pro&s;ecuted; an expre&s;&s;ion of a di&s;po&s;ition to prefer &s;omething to &s;elf-intere&s;t, that is indeed preferable in it &s;elf.&mdash;But if God be indeed &s;o great, and &s;o excellent, that all other beings are as nothing to him, and all other excellency be as nothing and le&s;s than nothing, and vanity in compari&s;on of his; and God be omni&s;cient and infallible and perfectly knows that he is infinitely the mo&s;t valuable being; then it is fit that his heart &s;hould be agreable to this, which is indeed the true nature and proportion of things and agreable to this infallible and all-comprehending under&s;tanding which he has of them, and that perfectly clear light in which he views them: and &s;o 'tis fit and &s;uitable that he &s;hould value him&s;elf infinitely more than his creatures.</P>
<P N="2">2.

It is a regard to him&s;elf that di&s;po&s;es him to diffu&s;e and commu|nicate him&s;elf.

<P>HERE by the way it may be properly con&s;idered, whether &s;ome writers are not chargeable with incon&s;i&s;tence in this re&s;pect, viz. that whereas they &s;peak again&s;t the doctrine of God's making him&s;elf his own highe&s;t and la&s;t end, as tho' this were an ignoble &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in God: when indeed he only is fit to be made the highe&s;t end, by him&s;elf and all other beings; in as much as he is the highe&s;t Being, and infinitely greater and more worthy than all others.&mdash;Yet with regard to creatures, who are infinitely le&s;s worthy of &s;upreme and ultimate regard, they (in effect at lea&s;t) &s;uppo&s;e that they nece&s;&s;arily at all times &s;eek their own happine&s;s, and make it their ultimate end in all, even their

mo&s;t virtuous actions: And that this principle, regulated by wi&s;dom and prudence, as leading to that which is their true and highe&s;t happine&s;s is the foundation of all virtue and every thing that is morally good and excellent in them.</P>
<P>Object. 3. To what has been has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that God makes him&s;elf his end in this way, viz. in &s;eeking that his glory &amp; excellent perfection &s;hould be known, e&s;teemed, loved and delighted in by his creatures, it may be objected, that this &s;eems unworthy of God. It is con&s;idered as below a truly great man, to be much influenced in his conduct, by a de&s;ire of popular applau&s;e. The notice and admiration of a gazing multitude, would be e&s;teemed but a low end, to be aimed at by a prince or philo&s;opher, in any great and noble enterprize. How much more is it unworthy the great God, to perform his magnificent works, e. g. the creation of the va&s;t univer&s;e, out of regard to the notice and admi|ration of worms of the du&s;t: That the di&s;plays of his mag|nificence may be gazed at, and applauded by tho&s;e who are infinitely more beneath him, than the meane&s;t rabble are beneath the greate&s;t prince or philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>THIS objection is &s;pecious. It hath a &s;hew of argu|ment; but it will appear to be nothing but a &s;hew, if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. WHETHER or no it be not worthy of God, to regard and value what is excellent and valuable in it&s;elf; and &s;o to take plea&s;ure in its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems not liable to any doubt, that there could be no|thing future, or no future exi&s;tence worthy to be de&s;ired or &s;ought by God, and &s;o worthy to be made his end, if no future exi&s;tence was valuable and worthy to be brought to effect. If when the world was not, there was any po&s;&s;ible future thing fit and valuable in it&s;elf, I think the knowledge of God's glory, and the e&s;teem and love of it mu&s;t be &s;o. Under&s;tanding and will are the highe&s;t kind of created ex|i&s;tence. And if they be valuable, it mu&s;t be in their ex|erci&s;e. But the highe&s;t and mo&s;t excellent kind of their exerci&s;e, is in &s;ome actual knowledge and exerci&s;e of will. And certainly the mo&s;t excellent actual knowledge and
<PB N="41" REF="009962_0047_0F7B3D2BC5AF7D78">
will, that can be in the creature, is the knowledge and the love of God. And the mo&s;t true excellent knowledge of God is the knowledge of his glory or moral excellence: and the mo&s;t excellent exerci&s;e of the will con&s;i&s;ts in e&s;teem and love and a delight in his glory.&mdash;If any created ex|i&s;tence is in it&s;elf worthy to be, or any thing that ever was future is worthy of exi&s;tence, &s;uch a communication of divine fulne&s;s, &s;uch an emanation and expre&s;&s;ion of the divine glory is worthy of exi&s;tence. But if nothing that ever was future was worthy to exi&s;t, then no future thing was worthy to be aimed at by God in creating the world. And if nothing was worthy to be aimed at in creation, then nothing was worthy to be God's end in creation.</P>
<P>IF God's own excellency and glory is worthy to be high|ly valued and delighted in by him, then the value and e&s;teem hereof by others, is worthy to be regarded by him: for this is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. To make this plain, let it be con&s;idered how it is with regard to the excellent qualities of another. If we highly value the vir|tues and excellencies of a friend, in proportion as we do &s;o, we &s;hall approve of and like others e&s;teem of them; and &s;hall di&s;approve and di&s;like the contempt of them. If the&s;e virtues are truly valuable, they are worthy that we &s;hould thus approve others e&s;teem, and di&s;approve their contempt of them.&mdash;And the ca&s;e is the &s;ame with re&s;pect to any Being's own qualities or attributes. If he highly e&s;|teems them, and greatly delights in them, he will naturally and nece&s;&s;arily love to &s;ee e&s;teem of them in others, &amp; di&s;like their di&s;e&s;teem. And if the attributes are worthy to be highly e&s;teem'd by the Being who hath them, &s;o is the e&s;teem of them in others worthy to be proportionably ap|proved and regarded.&mdash;I de&s;ire it may be con&s;idered, whether it be unfit that God &s;hould be di&s;pleas'd with con|tempt of him&s;elf? If not, but on the contrary it be fit and &s;uitable that he &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed with this, there is the &s;ame rea&s;on that he &s;hould be plea&s;ed with the proper love e&s;teem and honor of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE matter may be al&s;o cleared, by con&s;idering what it would become us to approve of and value with re&s;pect to any public &s;ociety we belong to, e. g. our nation or country.
<PB N="42" REF="009962_0048_0F7B3D2CF6858118">
It becomes us to love our country; and therefore it be|comes us to value the ju&s;t honor of our country. But the &s;ame that it becomes us to value and de&s;ire for a friend, and the &s;ame that it becomes us to de&s;ire and &s;eek for the community, the &s;ame does it become God to value and &s;eek for him&s;elf; that is on &s;uppo&s;ition it becomes God to love him&s;elf as well as it does men to love a friend or the pub|lic; which I think has been before proved.&mdash;</P>
<P>Here are two things that ought particularly to be ad|verted to&mdash;1. That in God the love of him&s;elf, and the love of the public are not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, as in man. Becau&s;e God's Being as it were comprehends all. His ex|i&s;tence, being infinite, mu&s;t be equivalent to univer&s;al exi&s;t|ence. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on that public affection in the creature is fit and beautiful, God's regard to him&s;elf mu&s;t be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o likewi&s;e.&mdash;2. In God, the love of what is fit and decent, or the love of virtue, can't be a di&s;tinct thing from the love of him&s;elf. Becau&s;e the love of God is that wherein all virtue and holine&s;s does primarily and cheifly con&s;i&s;t, and God's own holine&s;s mu&s;t primarily con&s;i&s;t in the love of him&s;elf; as was before ob&s;erved. And if God's holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in love to him&s;elf, then it will imply an approbation of and plea&s;edne&s;s with the e&s;teem and loveli|ne&s;s of him in others. For a Being that loves him&s;elf, ne|ce&s;&s;arily loves&punc; Love to him&s;elf. If holine&s;s in God con&s;i&s;t chiefly in love to him&s;elf, holine&s;s in the creature mu&s;t chiefly con&s;i&s;t in love to him. And if God loves holine&s;s in him&s;elf, he mu&s;t love it in the creature.</P>
<P>VIRTUE by &s;uch of the late philo&s;ophers as &s;eem to be in chief repute, is placed in public affection or general bene|volence. And if the e&s;&s;ence of virtue lies primarily in this, then the love of virtue it &s;elf is virtuous, no otherwi&s;e, than as it is implied in or ari&s;es from this public affection, or exten&s;ive benevolence of mind. Becau&s;e if a man truly loves the public, he nece&s;&s;arily loves Love to the public.</P>
<P>Now therefore, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, if univer&s;al bene|volence in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, be the &s;ame thing with bene|volence to the divine Being, who is in effect univer&s;al Be|ing, it will follow, that love to virtue it&s;elf is no otherwi&s;e virtuous, than as it is implied in or ari&s;es from love to the
<PB N="43" REF="009962_0049_0F7B3D2D50D835C8">
divine Being. Con&s;equently God's own love to virtue is implied in love to him&s;elf: and is virtuous no otherwi&s;e than as it ari&s;es from love to him&s;elf. So that God's vir|tuous di&s;po&s;ition, appearing in love to holine&s;s in the crea|ture, is to be re&s;olved into the &s;ame thing with love to him&s;elf. And con&s;equently wherein&s;oever he makes vir|tue his end he makes him&s;elf his end.&mdash;In fine, God being as it were an all comprehending being, all his mo|ral perfections, as his holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, grace and benevo|lence are &s;ome way or other to be re&s;olved into a &s;u|pream and infinite regard to him&s;elf: and if &s;o it will be ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e that it becomes him to make him&s;elf his &s;upream and la&s;t end in his works.</P>
<P>I WOULD here ob&s;erve by the way, that if any in&s;i&s;t that it becomes God to love and take delight in the virtue of his creatures for its own &s;ake, in &s;uch a man|ner as not to love it from regard to him&s;elf; and that it &s;uppo&s;eth too much &s;elfi&s;hn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e that all God's delight in virtue is to be re&s;olv'd into delight in him&s;elf: This will contradict a former objection again&s;t God's tak|ing plea&s;ure in communications of him&s;elf; viz. that ina&s;much as God is perfectly independent and &s;elf-&s;ufficient therefore all his happine&s;s and plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ts in the in|joyment of him&s;elf. For in the pre&s;ent objection it is in&s;i&s;ted that it becomes God to have &s;ome plea&s;ure, love or delight in virtue di&s;tinct from his delight in him&s;elf. So that if the &s;ame per&s;ons make both objections they mu&s;t be incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN an&s;wer to the objection we are upon; as to God's creatures who&s;e e&s;teem and love he &s;eeks, being infinitely inferior to God as nothing and vanity.&mdash;I would ob&s;erve that it is not unworthy of God to take plea&s;ure in that which in it&s;elf is fit and amiable, even in tho&s;e that are infinitely below him. If there be infinite grace and con|de&s;cention in it, yet the&s;e are not unworthy of God; but infinitely to his honour and glory.</P>
<P>THEY who in&s;i&s;t that God's own glory was not an ultimate end of his creation of the world; but that all that he had any ultimate regard to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the happine&s;s

of his creatures; and &s;uppo&s;e that he made his creatures, and not him&s;elf his la&s;t end; do it under a colour of ex|alting and magnifying God's benevolence and love to his creatures.&mdash;But if his love to them be &s;o great, and he &s;o highly values them as to look upon them worthy to be his end in all his great works as they &s;uppo&s;e; they are not con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, in &s;uppo&s;ing that God has &s;o little value for their love and e&s;teem. For as the nature of love, e&s;pecially great love cau&s;es him that loves to va|lue the e&s;teem of the per&s;on beloved: &s;o that God &s;hould take plea&s;ure in the creatures ju&s;t love and e&s;teem will fol|low both from God's love to him&s;elf and his love to his creatures. If he e&s;teem and love him&s;elf, he mu&s;t ap|prove of e&s;teem and love to him&s;elf; and di&s;approve the contrary. And if he loves and values the creature, he mu&s;t value and take delight in their mutual love and e&s;teem: becau&s;e he loves not becau&s;e he needs them.</P>
<P N="3">3. As to what is alledged of its being unworthy of great men to be governed in their conduct and atchievements by a regard to the applau&s;e of the populace: I would ob&s;erve, what makes their applau&s;e to be worthy of &s;o little regard, is their ignorance, giddine&s;s and inju&s;tice. The applau&s;e of the multitude very frequently is not founded on any ju&s;t view and under&s;tanding of things, but on humour, mi&s;take, folly and unrea&s;onable affections. Such applau&s;e is truly worthy to be di&s;regarded&mdash;But 'tis not beneath a man of the greate&s;t dignity and wi&s;dom, to value the wi&s;e and ju&s;t e&s;teem of others, however inferior to him. The con|trary, in&s;tead of being an expre&s;&s;ion of greatne&s;s of mind, would &s;hew an haughty and mean &s;pirit. 'Tis &s;uch an e&s;|teem in his creatures only, that God hath any regard to: for 'tis &s;uch an e&s;teem only that is fit and amiable in it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4. To &s;uppo&s;e that God makes him&s;elf his ulti|mate end in the creation of the world derogates from the freene&s;s of his goodne&s;s, in his beneficence to his creatures: and from their obligations to gratitude for the good commu|nicated. For if God, in communicating his fulne&s;s, makes him&s;elf, and not the creatures, his end; then what good he does, he does for him&s;elf, and not for them; for his own &s;ake, and not theirs.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="009962_0051_0F7B3D300B8CE8C0">
<HI>An&s;.</HI> God and the creature in this affair of the emanati|on of the divine fulne&s;s, are not properly &s;et in oppo&s;ition; or made the oppo&s;ite parts of a disjunction. Nor ought God's glory and the creatures good, to be &s;poken of as if they were properly and entirely di&s;tinct, as they are in the objection. This &s;uppo&s;eth, that God's having re&s;pect to his glory and the communication of good to his creatures, are things altogether different: that God's communicating his fulne&s;s for him&s;elf, and his doing it for them, are things &s;tanding in a proper disjunction and oppo&s;ition.&mdash;Where|as if we were capable of having more full and perfect views of God and divine things, which are &s;o much above us, 'tis probable it would appear very clear to us, that the mat|ter is quite otherwi&s;e: and that the&s;e things, in&s;tead of ap|pearing entirely di&s;tinct, are implied one in the other. That God in &s;eeking his glory, therein &s;eeks the good of his crea|tures. Becau&s;e the emanation of his glory (which he &s;eeks and delights in, as he delights in him&s;elf &amp; his own eternal glory) implies the communicated excellency and happine&s;s of his creature. And that in communicating his fulne&s;s for them, he does it for him&s;elf. Becau&s;e their good, which he &s;eeks, is &s;o much in union and communion with him|&s;elf. God is their good. Their excellency and happine&s;s is nothing, but the emanation and expre&s;&s;ion of God's glo|ry: God in &s;eeking their glory and happine&s;s, &s;eeks him|&s;elf: and in &s;eeking him&s;elf, i. e. him&s;elf diffu&s;ed and ex|pre&s;&s;ed, (which he delights in, as he delights in his own beauty and fulne&s;s) he &s;eeks their glory and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS will the better appear, if we con&s;ider the degree and manner in which he aimed at the creatures excellency and happine&s;s in his creating the world; viz. the degree and manner of the creatures glory and happine&s;s during the whole of the de&s;ign'd eternal duration of the world, he was about to create: which is in greater and greater nearne&s;s and &s;trictne&s;s of union with him&s;elf, and greater and greater communion and participation with him in his own glory and happine&s;s, in con&s;tant progre&s;&s;ion, throughout all eter|nity. As the creature's good was viewed in this manner when God made the world for it, viz. with re&s;pect to the whole of the eternal duration of it, and the eternally pro|gre&s;&s;ive union and communion with him; &s;o the creature
<PB N="46" REF="009962_0052_0F7B3D309B91ADA0">
mu&s;t be viewed as in infinite &s;trict union with him&s;elf. In this view it appears that God's re&s;pect to the creature, in the whole, unites with his re&s;pect to him&s;elf. Both re|gards are like two lines which &s;eem at the beginning to be &s;eparate, but aim finally to meet in one, both being direct|ed to the &s;ame center.&mdash;And as to the good of the crea|ture it&s;elf, if viewed in its whole duration, and infinite pro|gre&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t be viewed as infinite; and &s;o not only be|ing &s;ome communication of God's glory, but as coming nearer and nearer to the &s;ame thing in its infinite fulne&s;s. The nearer any thing comes to infinite, the nearer it comes to an identity with God. And if any good, as viewed by God, is beheld as infinite, it can't be viewed as a di&s;tinct thing from God's own infinite glory.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle's di&s;cour&s;e of the great love of Chri&s;t to men, Eph. 5. 25. to the end, leads us thus to think of the love of Chri&s;t to his church; as coinciding with his love to him&s;elf, by virtue of the &s;trict union of the church with him. Thus "hu&s;bands love your wives, as Chri&s;t al&s;o loved the church, and gave him&s;elf for it&mdash;that he might pre&s;ent it to him&s;elf a glorious church. So ought men to love their wives, as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth him&s;elf&mdash;even as the Lord the church; for we are members of his body, of his fle&s;h, and of his bones."</P>
<P>Now I apprehend that there is nothing in this manner of God's &s;eeking the good of the creatures, or in his di&s;po|&s;ition to communicate of his own fulne&s;s to them, that at all derogates from the excellence of it, or the creature's ob|ligation.</P>
<P>GOD'S di&s;po&s;ition to communicate good, or to cau&s;e his own infinite fulne&s;s to flow forth, is not the le&s;s properly called God's goodne&s;s, becau&s;e the good that he communi|cates, is &s;omething of him&s;elf; a communication of his own glory, and what he delights in as he delights in his own glory. The creature has no le&s;s benefit by it; neither has &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition le&s;s of a direct tendency to the creature's benefit; or the le&s;s of a tendency to love to the creature, when the creature comes to exi&s;t. Nor is this di&s;po&s;ition in God to communicate of and diffu&s;e his own good, the le&s;s
<PB N="47" REF="009962_0053_0F7B3D3132A38FE0">
excellent, becau&s;e it is implied in his love and regard to him&s;elf. For his love to him&s;elf don't imply it any other|wi&s;e, but as it implies a love to whatever is worthy and ex|cellent. The emanation of God's glory, is in it&s;elf worthy and excellent, and &s;o God delights in it: and his delight in this excellent thing, is implied in his love to him&s;elf, or his own fulne&s;s; becau&s;e that is the fountain, and &s;o the &s;um and comprehen&s;ion of every thing that is excellent. And the matter &s;tanding thus, 'tis evident, that the&s;e things cannot derogate from the excellency of this di&s;po&s;ition in God, to an emanation of his own fulne&s;s, or communicati|on of good to the creature.</P>
<P>NOR does God's inclination to communicate good in this manner, i. e. from regard to him&s;elf, or delight in his own glory, at all dimini&s;h the freene&s;s of his beneficence in this communication. This will appear, if we con&s;ider particularly, in what ways, doing good to others from &s;elf-love, may be incon&s;i&s;tent with the freene&s;s of beneficence. And I conceive there are only the&s;e two ways,</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN any does good to another from confined &s;elf-love, that is oppo&s;ite to a general benevolence. This kind of &s;elf love is properly call'd <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</HI> In &s;ome &s;en&s;e, the mo&s;t benevolent generous per&s;on in the world, &s;eeks his own happine&s;s in doing good to others; becau&s;e he places his happine&s;s in their good. His mind is &s;o enlarged as to take them, as it were, into him&s;elf. Thus when they are hap|py he feels it, he partakes with them, and is happy in their happine&s;s. This is &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with the freene&s;s of beneficence, that on the contrary, free benevo|lence and kindne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in it. The mo&s;t free beneficence that can be in men, is doing good, not from a confined &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s, but from a di&s;po&s;ition to general benevolence, or love to beings in general.</P>
<P>BUT now, with re&s;pect to the divine being, there is no &s;uch thing as &s;uch confin'd &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in him, or a love to him&s;elf, oppo&s;ite to general benevolence. It is impo&s;&s;i|ble, becau&s;e he comprehends all entity, and all excellence in his own e&s;&s;ence. The fir&s;t Being, the eternal and infinite Being, is in effect, <HI>Being in general;</HI> and comprehends
<PB N="48" REF="009962_0054_0F7B3D31C64DA5C0">
univer&s;al exi&s;tence, as was ob&s;erved before. God in his benevolence to his creatures, can't have his heart enlarged in &s;uch a manner as to take in beings that he finds, who are originally out of him&s;elf, di&s;tinct and independent. This can't be in an infinite being, who exi&s;ts alone from eter|nity. But he, from his goodne&s;s, as it were enlarges him|&s;elf in a more excellent and divine manner. This is by communicating and diffu&s;ing him&s;elf; and &s;o in&s;tead of finding, making objects of his benevolence: not by taking into him&s;elf what he finds di&s;tinct from him&s;elf, and &s;o partaking of their good, and being happy in them; but by flowing forth, and expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in them, and making them to partake of him, and rejoicing in him&s;elf expre&s;&s;ed in them, and communicated to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER thing, in doing good to others from &s;elf-love, that derogates from the freene&s;s of the goodne&s;s; is doing good to others from dependence on them for the good we need, or de&s;ire: which dependence obliges. So that in our beneficence we are not &s;elf-moved, but as it were, con&s;trained by &s;omething without our&s;elves. But it has been particularly &s;hewn already, that God's making him&s;elf his end, in the manner that has been &s;poken of, argues no dependence; but is con&s;i&s;tent with ab&s;olute in|dependence and &s;elf-&s;ufficience.</P>
<P>AND I would here ob&s;erve, that there is &s;omething in that di&s;po&s;ition in God to communicate goodne&s;s, which &s;hews him to be independent and &s;elf-moved in it, in a manner that is peculiar, and above what is in the beneficence of creatures. Creatures, even the mo&s;t gra|cious of them, are not &s;o independent and &s;elf-moved in their goodne&s;s; but that in all the exerci&s;es of it, they are excited by &s;ome object that they find: &s;omething ap|pearing good, or in &s;ome re&s;pect worthy of regard, pre&s;ents it&s;elf, and moves their kindne&s;s. But God being all and alone is ab&s;olutely &s;elf-moved. The exerci&s;es of his com|municative di&s;po&s;ition are ab&s;olutely from within him&s;elf, not finding any thing, or any object to excite them or draw them forth: but all that is good and worthy in the ob|ject, and the very <HI>being</HI> of the object, proceeding from the over flowing of his fulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="009962_0055_0F7B3D3280F4E368">
THESE things &s;hew that the &s;uppo&s;ition of God's mak|ing him&s;elf his la&s;t end, in the manner &s;poken of, don't at all dimini&s;h the creature's obligation to gratitude, for communications of good it receives. For if it le&s;&s;en it's obligation, it mu&s;t be on one of the following accounts. Either, that the creature has not &s;o much benefit by it; or, that the di&s;po&s;ition it flows from is not proper good|ne&s;s, not having &s;o direct a tendency to the creatures benefit; or that the di&s;po&s;ition is not &s;o virtuous and ex|cellent in it's kind; or that the beneficence is not &s;o free. But it has been ob&s;erved, that none of the&s;e things take place, with regard to that di&s;po&s;ition, which has been &s;uppo&s;ed to have excited God to create the world.</P>
<P>I CONFESS there is a degree of indi&s;tinctne&s;s and ob|&s;curity in the clo&s;e con&s;ideration of &s;uch &s;ubjects, and a great imperfection in the expre&s;&s;ions we u&s;e concerning them; ari&s;ing unavoidably from the infinite &s;ublimity of the &s;ubject, and the incomprehen&s;iblene&s;s of tho&s;e things that are divine. Hence revelation is the &s;ure&s;t guide in the&s;e matters; and what that teaches &s;hall in the next place be con&s;idered. Neverthele&s;s, the endeavours u&s;ed to di&s;cover what the voice of rea&s;on is, &s;o far as it can go, may &s;erve to prepare the way, by obviating cavils in&s;i&s;ted on by many; and to &s;atisfy us, that what the word of God &s;ays of the matter, is not unrea&s;onable; and thus prepare our minds for a more full acquie&s;cence in the in&s;tructions it gives, according to the more natural and genuine &s;en&s;e of words and expre&s;&s;ions, we find often u&s;ed there con|cerning this &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The &s;criptures repre&s;ent God as making him&s;elf his own la&s;t end in the creation of the world.</HEAD>
<P>IT is manife&s;t, that the &s;criptures &s;peak, on all occa&s;ions, as tho' God made him&s;elf his end in all his works: and as tho' the &s;ame being, who is the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things, were the &s;upream and la&s;t end of all things. Thus in I&s;ai. 44. 6. "Thus &s;aith the Lord, the king of I&s;rael, and his redeemer the Lord of ho&s;ts, I am the fir&s;t, I al&s;o am the la&s;t, and be&s;ides me there is no God". Cap. 48. 12. "I am the fir&s;t, and I am the la&s;t". Rev. 1. 8. I am alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending, &s;aith the Lord, which is, and was, and which is to come, the almighty. ver. 11. I am alpha and omega, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t. ver. 17. I am the fir&s;t and the la&s;t". Cap. 21. 6. "And he &s;aid unto me, it is done, I am alpha and omega, the beginning and the end". Cap. 22. 13. "I am alpha and omega, the be|ginning and the end, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t".</P>
<P>AND when God is &s;o often &s;poken of as the la&s;t as well as the fir&s;t, and the end as well as the beginning, what is meant (or at lea&s;t implied) is, that as he is the fir&s;t effici|ent cau&s;e and fountain from whence all things originate; &s;o he is the la&s;t final cau&s;e for which they are made; the final term to which they all tend in their ultimate i&s;&s;ue. This &s;eems to be the mo&s;t natural import of the&s;e expre&s;&s;i|ons; and is confirmed by other parallel pa&s;&s;ages; as Rom. 11. 36. "For of him and thro' and to him are all things". Col. 1. 16. "For by him were all things created, that are
<PB N="51" REF="009962_0057_0F7B3D34192558F0">
in heaven, and that are in earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, whe|ther they be thrones or dominions, principalities and pow|ers, all things were created by him, and for him". Heb. 2. 10. "For it became him, by whom are all things, and for whom are all things". In Prov. 16. 4. 'tis &s;aid ex|pre&s;ly, "The Lord hath made all things for him&s;elf".</P>
<P>AND the manner is ob&s;ervable, in which God is &s;aid to be the la&s;t, to whom, and for whom are all things. 'Tis evidently &s;poken of as a meet and &s;uitable thing, a branch of his glory; a meet prerogative of the great, infinite and eternal being; a thing becoming the dignity of him who is infinitely above all other beings; from whom all things are, and by whom they con&s;i&s;t, and in compari&s;on with whom, all other things are as nothing.</P>

<P>WHerein &s;ome po&s;itions are advanced concerning a ju&s;t method of arguing in this affair, from what we find in holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een that the &s;criptures &s;peak of the creation of the world as being for God, as its end. What remains therefore to be enquired into, is, <HI>which way do the &s;criptures repre&s;ent God as making him&s;elf his end?</HI></P>
<P>IT is evident that God don't make his exi&s;tence or being the end of the creation; nor can he be &s;uppo&s;ed to do &s;o without great ab&s;urdity. His being and exi&s;tence can't be conceived of but as prior to any of God's acts or de&s;igns: they mu&s;t be pre&s;uppo&s;ed as the ground of them. There|fore it can't be in this way that God makes him&s;elf the end of his creating the world. He can't create the world to the end that he may have exi&s;tence; or may have &s;uch attri|butes and perfections, and &s;uch an e&s;&s;ence. Nor do the &s;criptures give the lea&s;t intimation of any &s;uch thing. There|fore, what divine effect, or what is it in relation to God, that is the thing which the &s;cripture teacheth us to be the end he aimed at in his works of creation, in de&s;igning of which, he makes <HI>him&s;elf</HI> his end?</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="009962_0058_0F7B3D34B98A1A40">
IN order to a right under&s;tanding of the &s;cripture doc|trine, and drawing ju&s;t inferences from what we find &s;aid in the word of God relative to this matter; &s;o to open the way to a true and definitive an&s;wer to the above enquiry, I would lay down the following po&s;itions,</P>
<P>Po&s;ition, 1. THAT which appears to be &s;poken of as God's ultimate end in his works of providence in general, we may ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e to be his la&s;t end in the work of cre|ation&mdash;This appears from what was ob&s;erved before (un|der the fifth particular of the introduction) which I need not now repeat.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 2. WHEN any thing appears by the &s;cripture to be the la&s;t end of &s;ome of the works of God, which thing ap|pears in fact, to be the re&s;ult, not only of this work, but of God's works in general. And altho' it be not mentioned as the end of tho&s;e works, but only or &s;ome of them, yet being actually the re&s;ult of other works as well as that, &amp; nothing appears peculiar, in the nature of the ca&s;e, that renders it a fit, and beautiful and valuable re&s;ult of tho&s;e particular works, more than of the re&s;t; but it appears with equal rea&s;on de&s;irable and valuable in the ca&s;e of all works, of which it is &s;poken of in the word of God as (and &s;een in fact to be) the effect; we may ju&s;tly infer, that thing to be the la&s;t end of tho&s;e other works al&s;o. For we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it to be on account of the valuablene&s;s of the effect, that it is made the end of tho&s;e works of which it is expre&s;ly &s;poken of as the end: and this effect, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, being e|qually, and in like manner the re&s;ult of the work, and of the &s;ame value, 'tis but rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that it is the end of the work, of which it is naturally the con&s;equence, in one ca&s;e as well as in another.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 3. THE ultimate end of God's creating the world, being al&s;o (as was before ob&s;erved) the la&s;t end of all God's works of providence, and that in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, and be|ing above all other things important, we may well pre&s;ume that this end will be chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on in the word of God, in the account it gives of God's de&s;igns and ends in his works of providence&mdash;and therefore, if there be any par|ticular thing, that we find more frequently mentioned in
<PB N="53" REF="009962_0059_0F7B3D36D570F7C8">
&s;cripture as God's ultimate aim in his works of providence, than any thing el&s;e, this is a pre&s;umption that this is the &s;upreme and ultimate end of God's works in general, and &s;o the end of the work of creation.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 4. THAT which appears from the word of God to be his la&s;t end with re&s;pect to the moral world, or God's la&s;t end in the creation and di&s;po&s;al of the intel|ligent part of the &s;y&s;tem, and in the moral government of the world, that is God's la&s;t end in the work of creation in general. Becau&s;e it is evident, from the con|&s;titution of the world it&s;elf, as well as from the word of God, that the moral part is the end of all the re&s;t of the creation. The inanimate unintelligent part is made for the rational as much as a hou&s;e is prepared for the inhabitant. And it is evident al&s;o from rea&s;on and the word of God, that it is with regard to what is moral in them, or for the &s;ake of &s;ome moral good in them, that moral agents are made &amp; the world made for them.&mdash;But it is further evident that what&s;oever is the la&s;t end of that part of creation that is the end of all the re&s;t, and for which all the re&s;t of the world was made, mu&s;t be the la&s;t end of the whole. If all the other parts of a watch are made for the hand of the watch, to move that aright, and for a due and proper regulation of that, then it will follow, that the la&s;t end of the hand, is the la&s;t end of the whole machine.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 5. THAT, which appears from the &s;cripture to be God's la&s;t end in the chief work or works of his pro|vidence, we may well determine is God's la&s;t end in cre|ating the world. For as was ob&s;erved, we may ju&s;tly in|fer the end of a thing from the u&s;e of it. We may ju&s;tly infer the end of a clock, a chariot, a &s;hip, or water-en|gine from the main u&s;e to which it is applied. But God's providence is his u&s;e of the world he has made. And if there be any work or works of providence that are evi|dently God's main work or works, herein appears and con&s;i&s;ts the main u&s;e that God makes of the creation.&mdash;From the&s;e two la&s;t po&s;itions we may infer the next, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="009962_0060_0F7B3D3764FDC1D0">
Po&s;. 6. WHATEVER appears by the &s;criptures to be God's la&s;t end in his main work or works of providence towards the moral world, that we ju&s;tly infer to be the la&s;t end of the creation of the world. Becau&s;e as was ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, the moral world is the cheif part of the cre|ation and the end of the re&s;t; and God's la&s;t end in cre|ating that part of the world, mu&s;t be his la&s;t end in the creation of the whole. And it appears by the la&s;t po&s;i|tion, that the end of God's main work or works of provi|dence towards them, or the main u&s;e he puts them to, &s;hews the la&s;t end for which he has made them; and con&s;equently the main end for which he has made the whole world.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 7. THAT which divine revelation &s;hews to be God's la&s;t end with re&s;pect to that part of the moral world which are good, or which are according to his mind, or &s;uch as he would have them be; I &s;ay that which is God's la&s;t end with re&s;pect to the&s;e (i. e. his la&s;t end in their being, and in their being good) this we mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e to be the la&s;t end of God's creating the world. For it has been already &s;hewn that God's la&s;t end in the moral part of creation mu&s;t be the end of the whole. But his end in that part of the moral world that are good, mu&s;t be the la&s;t end for which he has made the moral world in general. For therein con&s;i&s;ts the goodne&s;s of a thing, viz. in its fitne&s;s to an&s;wer its end: or at lea&s;t this mu&s;t be goodne&s;s in the eyes of the author of that thing. For goodne&s;s in his eyes is its agreablene&s;s to his mind. But an agreablene&s;s to his mind in what he makes for &s;ome end or u&s;e, mu&s;t be an agreablene&s;s or fitne&s;s to that end. For his end in this ca&s;e is his mind. That which he chiefly aims at in that thing, is chiefly his mind with re&s;pect to that thing. And therefore they are good moral agents, who are fitted for the end for which God has made moral agents: as they are good machines, in|&s;truments and uten&s;ils that are fitted to the end they are de&s;igned for. And con&s;equently that which is the chief end to which in being good they are fitted that is the chief end of uten&s;ils. So that which is the chief end to which good created moral agents in being good are fitted, this is the chief end of moral agents, or the moral part
<PB N="55" REF="009962_0061_0F7B3D37CFECF720">
of the creation; and con&s;equently of the creation in general.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 8. THAT, which the word of God requires the intelligent and moral part of the world to &s;eek as their main end, or to have re&s;pect to in that they do, and regu|late all their conduct by, as their ultimate &amp; highe&s;t end, that we have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e is the la&s;t end for which God has made them; and con&s;equently by po&s;ition fourth, the la&s;t end for which he has made the whole world. A main difference between the intelligent and moral parts, and the re&s;t of the world, lies in this, that the former are capable of knowing their creator, and the end for which he made them, and capable of actively complying with his de&s;ign in their creation and promoting it; while other creatures can't promote the de&s;ign of their creation, only pa&s;&s;ively and e|ventually. And &s;eeing they are capable of knowing the end for which their author has made them, 'tis doubtle&s;s their duty to fall in with it. Their wills ought to comply with the will of the creator in this re&s;pect, in mainly &s;eek|ing the &s;ame as their la&s;t end which God mainly &s;eeks as their la&s;t end. This mu&s;t be the law of nature and rea&s;on with re&s;pect to them. And we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that God's reveal'd law, and the law of nature agree; and that his will, as a lawgiver, mu&s;t agree with his will as a creator. Therefore we ju&s;tly infer, that the &s;ame thing which God's revealed law requires intelligent creatures to &s;eek as their la&s;t and greate&s;t end, that God their creator has made their la&s;t end, and &s;o the end of the creation of the world.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 9. WE may well &s;uppo&s;e that what &s;eems in holy &s;cripture from time to time to be &s;poken of as the main end of the goodne&s;s of the good part of the moral world, &s;o that the re&s;pect and relation their virtue or goodne&s;s has to that end, is what chiefly makes it valuable and de&s;irable; I &s;ay, we may well &s;uppo&s;e that to be the thing which is God's la&s;t end in the creation of the moral world; and &s;o by po|&s;ition fourth, of the whole world. For the end of the good|ne&s;s of a thing, is the end of the thing. Herein, it was ob|&s;erved before, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t the goodne&s;s or valuablene&s;s of any thing in the eyes of him that made it for his

u&s;e. viz. its being good for that u&s;e, or good with re&s;pect to the end for which he made it.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 10. THAT which per&s;ons who are de&s;cribed in &s;cripture as approved &s;aints, and &s;et forth as examples of piety, &s;ought as their la&s;t and highe&s;t end in the things which they did, and which are mentioned as parts of their holy conver&s;ation, or in&s;tances of their good and approved behaviour; that we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, was what they ought to &s;eek as their la&s;t end; and con&s;equently by the preceeding po&s;ition, was the &s;ame with God's la&s;t end in the creation of the world.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 11. THAT which appears by the word of God to be that end or event, in the de&s;ire of which, the &s;ouls of the good parts of the moral world, e&s;pecially of the be&s;t, and in their be&s;t frames, do mo&s;t naturally and directly exerci&s;e their goodne&s;s in, and in expre&s;&s;ing of their de&s;ire of this event or end, they do mo&s;t properly and directly expre&s;s their re&s;pect to God; we may, I &s;ay, well &s;uppo&s;e, that e|vent or end to be the chief and ultimate end of a &s;pirit of piety and goodne&s;s, and God's chief end in making the mo|ral world, and &s;o the whole world. For doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t direct and natural de&s;ire and tendency of a &s;pirit of true goodne&s;s in the good and be&s;t part of the moral world is to the chief end of goodne&s;s, and &s;o the chief end of the cre|ation of the moral world. And in what el&s;e can the &s;pirit of true re&s;pect and friend&s;hip to God be expre&s;s'd by way of de&s;ire, than de&s;ires of the &s;ame end, which God him&s;elf chiefly and ultimately de&s;ires and &s;eeks in making them and all other things.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 12. SINCE the holy &s;criptures teach us that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the head of the moral world, and e&s;pecially of all the good part of it; the chief of God's &s;ervants, appointed to be the head of his &s;aints and angels, and &s;et forth as the chief and mo&s;t perfect pattern and example of goodne&s;s; we may well &s;uppo&s;e by the foregoing po&s;itions, that what he &s;ought as his la&s;t end, was God's la&s;t end in the creati|on of the world.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>PArticular texts of &s;cripture, that &s;hew that God's glo|ry is an ultimate end of the creation.</P>
<P>WHAT God &s;ays in I&s;ai. 48. 11. naturally leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that the way in which God makes him&s;elf his end in his work or works which he does for his own &s;ake, is in making his glory his end. "For my own &s;ake, even for my own &s;ake will I do it. For how &s;hould my name be polluted: and I will not give my glory to another". Which is as much as to &s;ay, I will obtain my end, I will not forego my glory: another &s;hall not take this prize from me. 'Tis pretty evident here, that God's name and his glory, which &s;eems to intend the &s;ame thing (as &s;hall be ob&s;erved more particularly afterwards) are &s;poken of as his la&s;t end in the great work mentioned, not as an inferior &s;ubordinate end, &s;ub&s;ervient to the intere&s;t of others. The words are em|phatical. The empha&s;is and repetition con&s;train us to un|der&s;tand that what God does, is ultimately for his own &s;ake: "For <HI>my own &s;ake,</HI> even for <HI>my own &s;ake</HI> will I do it."</P>
<P>So the words of the apo&s;tle, in Rom. 11. 36. naturally lead us to &s;uppo&s;e that the way in which all things are to God, is in being for his glory. "For of him, and through him, and to him are all things. to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen". In the preceeding context the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves the marvellous di&s;po&s;als of divine wi&s;dom, for cau&s;ing all things to be to him in their final i&s;&s;ue and re&s;ult, as they are from him at fir&s;t, &amp; governed by him. His di&s;cour&s;e &s;hews how God contrived and brought this to pa&s;s in his di&s;po&s;ition of things, viz. by &s;etting up the kingdom of Chri&s;t in the world; leaving the jews, and calling the gen|tiles; and in what he would hereafter do in bringing in the jews with the fulne&s;s of the gentiles; with the circum&s;tan|ces of the&s;e wonderful works, &s;o as greatly to &s;hew his ju&s;|tice and his goodne&s;s, magnify his grace, and manife&s;t the &s;overeignty and freene&s;s of it, and the ab&s;olute dependence of all on him&mdash;And then in the four la&s;t ver&s;es, breaks out into a mo&s;t pathetic rapturous exclamation, expre&s;&s;ing his great admiration of the depth of divine wi&s;dom in the
<PB N="58" REF="009962_0064_0F7B3D39FB0DEB80">
&s;teps he takes for the attaining his end, and cau&s;ing all things to be to him: and finally, he expre&s;&s;es a joyful con&s;ent to God's excellent de&s;ign in all to glorify him&s;elf, in &s;aying, "to him be glory forever"; as much as to &s;ay, as all things are &s;o wonderfully ordered for his glory, &s;o let him have the glory of all, forevermore.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE glory of God is &s;poken of in holy &s;cripture as the la&s;t end for which that part of the moral world that are good were made. Thus in I&s;ai. 43. 6, 7. "I will &s;ay to the north give up, and to the &s;outh keep not back, bring my &s;ons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth, even every one that is called by my name; for I have created him <HI>for my glory,</HI> I have formed him, yea I have made him". I&s;ai. 60. 21. "Thy people al&s;o &s;hall be all righteous. They &s;hall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hand, <HI>that I may be glorifi|ed</HI>". chap. 61. 3. "That they may be called trees of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the planting of the Lord, <HI>that he might be glorified</HI>".</P>
<P>IN the&s;e places we &s;ee that the glory of God is &s;poken of as the end of God's &s;aints, the end for which he makes them, i. e. either gives them being, or gives them a being as &s;aints, or both. It is &s;aid that God has made and form|ed them to be his &s;ons and daughters, <HI>for his own glory:</HI> That they are trees of his planting, the work of his hands, as trees of righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>that he might be glorified.</HI>&mdash;And if we con&s;ider the words, e&s;pecially as taken with the con|text in each of the places, it will appear quite unnatural, to &s;uppo&s;e that God's glory is here &s;poken of only as an end inferiour and &s;ubordinate to the happine&s;s of God's people; or as a prediction that God would create, form and plant them that he might be glorified, that &s;o God's people might be happy. On the contrary, if we take the places with the context, they will appear rather as pro|mi&s;es of making God's people happy, that God therein might be glorified. So is that in the 43d chap. as we &s;hall &s;ee plainly, if we take the whole that is &s;aid from the beginning of the chapter. 'Tis wholly a promi&s;e of a future, great and wonderful work of God's power and grace, delivering his people from all mi&s;ery, and making
<PB N="59" REF="009962_0065_0F7B3D3ABA0587E8">
them exceeding happy; and then the end of all, or the &s;um of God's de&s;ign in all, is declared to be God's own glory. "I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.&mdash;I will be with thee.&mdash;When thou walke&s;t thro' the fire, thou &s;halt not be burnt, nor the flame kindle upon thee,&mdash;thou art precious and honorable in my &s;ight. I will give men for thee, and people for thy life. Fear not, I am with thee.&mdash;I will bring my &s;ons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; every one that is called by my name: <HI>for I have created him for my glory.</HI>"</P>
<P>So it plainly is chap. 60. ver. 21. the whole chapter is made up of nothing but promi&s;es of future, exceeding happine&s;s to God's church. But for brevity's &s;ake, let us take only the two preceeding ver&s;es. "The &s;un &s;hall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightne&s;s &s;hall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord &s;hall be unto thee an everla&s;ting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy &s;un &s;hall no more go down, neither &s;hall thy moon withdraw it&s;elf: for the Lord &s;hall be thine everla&s;ting light, and the days of thy mourning &s;hall be ended. Thy people al&s;o &s;hall be all righteous; they &s;hall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands," and then the end of all is added, "<HI>that I might be glorified.</HI>" All the preceed|ing promi&s;es are plainly mentioned as &s;o many parts or con&s;tituents of the great and exceeding happine&s;s of God's people; and God's glory is mentioned rather as God's end, or the &s;um of his de&s;ign in this happine&s;s, than this happine&s;s as the end of this glory. Ju&s;t in like manner is the promi&s;e in the third ver&s;e of the next chapter. To ap|point to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for a&s;hes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of prai&s;e for the &s;pirit of heavine&s;s, that they might be called trees of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the planting of the Lord, <HI>that he might be glorified".</HI> The work of God promi&s;ed to be effected, is plainly an accompli&s;hment of the joy, gladne&s;s and happi|ne&s;s of God's people, in&s;tead of their mourning and &s;orrow; and the end in which the work i&s;&s;ues, or that in which God's de&s;ign in this work is obtained and &s;ummed up, is his glory. This proves by the &s;eventh po&s;ition, that God's glory is the end of the creation.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="009962_0066_0F7B3D3B8156D1B8">
THE &s;ame thing may be argued from Jer 13. 11. "For as a girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, &s;o have I cau&s;ed to cleave unto me the whole hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and the whole hou&s;e of Judah, &s;aith the Lord: that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a prai&s;e, and <HI>for a glory:</HI> but they would not hear". That is, God &s;ought to make them to be his own holy people; or, as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, his peculiar people, zealous of good works; that &s;o they might be a glory to him, as girdles were u&s;ed in tho&s;e days for ornament and beauty, and as badges of dignity and honor.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ver. 9. and al&s;o I&s;ai. 3. 24, and 22. 21, and 23. 10. 2 Sam. 18. 11. Exod. 28. 8.</NOTE> Which is agreeable to the places ob|&s;erved before, that &s;peak of the church as the glory of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now when God &s;peaks of him&s;elf, as &s;eeking a peculiar and holy people for him&s;elf, to be for his glory and honor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a man that &s;eeks an ornament and badge of honor for his glory, 'tis not natural to under&s;tand it meerly of a &s;ub|ordinate end, as tho' God had no re&s;pect to him&s;elf in it; but only the good of others. If &s;o, the compari&s;on would not be natural; for men are commonly wont to &s;eek their own glory and honor in adorning them&s;elves, and dignifying them&s;elves with badges of honor, out of re&s;pect to them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame doctrine &s;eems to be taught, Eph. 44. 23. "Having prede&s;tinated us to the adoption of children, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, unto him&s;elf, according to the good plea&s;ure of his will, to the prai&s;e of the glory of his grace".</P>
<P>THE &s;ame may be argued from I&s;ai. 44. 23. "For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, he hath glorified him&s;elf in I&s;|rael". And chap. 49. 3. "Thou art my &s;ervant Jacob, in whom I will be glorified". Joh. 17. 10. "And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them". 2 The&s;. 1. 10. "When he &s;hall come to be glo|rified in his &s;aints". ver. 11. 12. "Wherefore al&s;o we pray always for you, that our God would count you wor|thy

of his calling, and fulfill all the good plea&s;ure of his goodne&s;s, and the work of faith with power: that the name of our Lord Je&s;us may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of God and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t".</P>
<P N="3">3. THE &s;cripture &s;peaks from time to time, of God's glo|ry, as tho' it were his ultimate end of the goodne&s;s of the moral part of the creation; and that end, in a re&s;pect and relation to which chiefly it is, that the value or worth of their virtue con&s;i&s;ts. As in Phil. 1. 10. 11. "That ye may approve things that are excellent, that ye may be &s;in|cere, and without offence till the day of Chri&s;t: being fill|ed with the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which are by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, unto the glory and prai&s;e of God." Here the apo&s;tle &s;hews how the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s in them are valuable and how they an&s;wer their end. viz. in being "by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to the prai&s;e and glory of God." Joh. 15. 8. "Herein is my father glorified, that ye bear much fruit." Signifying that by this means it is, that the great end of religion is to be an&s;wered. And in 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4. 11. the apo&s;tle directs the chri&s;tians to regulate all their reli|gious performances, with reference to that one end. "If any man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the oracles of God: if any man mini&s;ter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified; to whom be prai&s;e and dominion forever and ever, amen." And, from time to time, embracing and practi&s;ing true re|ligion, and repenting of &s;in, and turning to holine&s;s, is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by glorifying God, as tho' that were the &s;um and end of the whole matter. <HI>Rev.</HI> 11. 13. "And in the earth|quake were &s;lain of men &s;even thou&s;and; and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven." So, <HI>Rev.</HI> 14. 6, 7. "And I &s;aw another angel fly in the mid&s;t of heaven, having the everla&s;ting go&s;pel to preach to them that dwell on the earth;&mdash;&s;aying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him." As tho' this were the &s;um and end of that virtue and religion, which was the grand de&s;ign of preaching the go&s;pel every where thro' the world. <HI>Rev.</HI> 16. 9.&mdash;"And repented not, to give him glory."

<P>AND as the exerci&s;e of true religion and virtue in chri&s;ti|ans is &s;ummarily expre&s;&s;ed by their glorifying God; &s;o when the good influence of this on others, as bringing them by the example to turn to the ways and practice of true goodne&s;s, is &s;poken of, it is expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner. <HI>Matt.</HI> 5. 16.

<P>THAT the ultimate end of moral goodne&s;s, or righte|ou&s;ne&s;s is an&s;wer'd in God's glory being attain'd, is &s;uppo|&s;ed in the objection which the apo&s;tle makes, or &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome will make, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 7. "For if the truth of God hath more abounded thro' my lie unto his glory, why am I judged as a &s;inner?" i. e. &s;eeing the great end of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s is an&s;wer'd by my &s;in, in God's being glorified, why is my &s;in condemned and puni&s;hed: and why is not my vice equivalent to virtue?</P>
<P>AND the glory of God is &s;poken of as that wherein con&s;i&s;ts the value and end of particular graces. As of faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 20. "He &s;taggered not at the promi&s;e of God thro' unbelief; but was &s;trong in faith, giving glory to God." <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 11.

&s;eems to &s;ay this to &s;uch as abounded in their &s;acrifices and outward ceremonies of religion, as taking it for grant|ed, and as what they knew already, and &s;uppo&s;ed in their religious performances, that the end of all religion was to glorify God. They &s;uppo&s;ed they did this in the be&s;t manner, in offering a multitude of &s;acrifices (&s;ee the pre|ceeding part of the p&s;alm.) But here God corrects this mi&s;take, and informs that this grand end of religion is not attain'd this way, but in offering the more &s;piritual &s;acri|fices of prai&s;e and a holy conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>IN fine, the words of the apo&s;tle in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 20. are worthy of particular notice. "Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body and in your &s;pirit, which are his." Here not only is glorifying God &s;poken of, as what &s;ummarily compre|hends the end of that religion and &s;ervice of God, which is the end of Chri&s;t's redeeming us: but here I would fur|ther remark this.&mdash;That the apo&s;tle in this place urges, that inasmuch as we are not our own, but bought for God, that we might be his; therefore we ought not to act as if we were our own, but as God's; and &s;hould not u&s;e the members of our bodies, or faculties of our &s;ouls for our|&s;elves, as making our&s;elves our end, but for God, as mak|ing him our end. And he expre&s;&s;es the way in which we are to make God our end, viz. in making his glory our end. "Therefore glorify God in your body and in your &s;pirit, which are his." Here it can't be pretended, that though chri&s;tians are indeed required to make God's glory their end; yet it is but as a &s;ubordinate end, as &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to their own happine&s;s, as a higher end; for then in acting chiefly and ultimately for their own&s;elves, they would u&s;e them&s;elves more as their own, than as God's; which is directly contrary to the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle's ex|hortation, and the argument he is upon; which is, that we &s;hould give our&s;elves, as it were, away from our&s;elves to God, and u&s;e our&s;elves as his, and not our own, acting for his &s;ake, and not our own &s;akes. Thus it is evident by po&s;. 9. that the glory of God is the la&s;t end for which he created the world.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="64" REF="009962_0070_0F7B3D3F957E3280">
4. THERE are &s;ome things in the word of God, that lead us to &s;uppo&s;e that it requires of men, that they &s;hould de&s;ire and &s;eek God's glory, as their highe&s;t and la&s;t end in what they do. As particularly the pa&s;&s;age la&s;t menti|oned. This appears from what has been ju&s;t now ob&s;erv'd upon it. The &s;ame may be argued from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 30. "Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God." And 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4. 11.&mdash;"That God in all things may be glorified." Which was men|tioned before. And it may be argued that Chri&s;t requires his followers &s;hould de&s;ire and &s;eek God's glory in the fir&s;t place, and above all things el&s;e, from that prayer which he gave his di&s;ciples, as the pattern and rule for the di|rection of his followers in their prayers. The fir&s;t petition of which is, "Hallowed be thy name." Which in &s;crip|ture language is the &s;ame with, glorified be thy name; as is manife&s;t from <HI>Lev.</HI> 10. 3. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 28. 22. and many other places. Now our la&s;t and highe&s;t end is doubtle&s;s what &s;hould be fir&s;t in our de&s;ires, and con&s;equently fir&s;t in our prayers: and therefore we may argue, that &s;ince Chri&s;t di|rects that God's glory &s;hould be fir&s;t in our prayers, that there|fore this is our la&s;t end. This is further confirmed by the conclu&s;ion of the Lord's prayer, "For thine is the king|dom, the power and glory." Which, as it &s;tands in con|nection with the re&s;t of the prayer, implies that we de&s;ire and ask all the&s;e things, which are mentioned in each peti|tion, with a &s;ubordination, and in &s;ub&s;ervience to the do|minion and glory of God; in which all our de&s;ires ulti|mately terminate, as their la&s;t end. God's glory and domi|nion are the two fir&s;t things mentioned in the prayer, and are the &s;ubject of the fir&s;t half of the prayer; and they are the two la&s;t things mentioned in the &s;ame prayer, in it's conclu&s;ion: and God's glory is the alpha and omega in the prayer. From the&s;e things we may argue, according to po&s;. 8. that God's glory is the la&s;t end of the creation.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE glory of God appears, by the account given in the word of God, to be that end or event, in the earne&s;t de&s;ires of which, and in their delight in which, the be&s;t part of the moral world, and when in their be&s;t frames, do mo&s;t naturally expre&s;s the direct tendency of the &s;pirit of true goodne&s;s, and give vent to the virtuous and pious

affections of their heart, and do mo&s;t properly and directly te&s;tify their &s;upream re&s;pect to their creator. This is the way in which the holy apo&s;tles, from time to time, gave vent to the ardent exerci&s;es of their piety, and expre&s;&s;ed and breathed forth their regard to the &s;upream being. Rom. 11. 36. "To whom be glory forever and ever, amen". Chap. 16. 27. "To God only wi&s;e, be glory, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, forever, amen". Gal. 1. 4, 5. "Who gave him&s;elf for our &s;ins, that he might deliver us from this pre&s;ent evil world, according to the will of God and our father, to whom be glory forever and ever, amen". 2 Tim. 4. 18. "And the Lord &s;hall deliver me from every evil work, and will pre&s;erve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory forever and ever, amen". Eph. 3. 21. "Unto him be glory in the church, by Chri&s;t Je&s;us throughout all ages, world without end". Heb. 13. 21.&mdash;"Through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom be glory forever and ever, amen". Phil 4. 20. "Now unto God and our father, be glory forever and ever, amen". 2 Pet. 3. 18. "To him be glory both now and forever, amen". Jude 25. "To the only wi&s;e God our &s;aviour, be glory and maje&s;ty, dominion and power, both now and ever, amen". Rev. 1. 5, 6. "Unto him that loved us &amp;c&mdash;to him be glory and dominion forever and ever, amen". It was in this way that holy David, the &s;weet p&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael, vented the ardent tendencies and de&s;ires of his pi|ous heart. 1 Chron. 16. 28, 29. "Give unto the LORD ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and &s;trength: give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name". We have much the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions again, P&s;al. 29. 1, 2. and 69. 7, 8. See al&s;o, P&s;al. 57. 5. 72. 18, 19. 115. 1. So the whole church of God, thro' all parts of the earth. I&s;ai. 42. 10, 11, 12. In like manner the &s;aints and angels in heaven expre&s;s the piety of their hearts. Rev. 4. 9, 11. and 5. 11, 12, 13, 14. and 7. 12. This is the event that the hearts of the &s;eraphim e&s;pecially exult in, as appears by I&s;ai. 6, 2, 3. "Above it &s;tood the &s;eraphim.&mdash;And one cried unto another and &s;aid, Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of ho&s;ts, the whole earth is full of his glory". So at the birth of Chri&s;t, Luk. 2. 14.

IT is manife&s;t that the&s;e holy per&s;ons in earth and hea|ven, in thus expre&s;&s;ing their de&s;ires of the glory of God, have re&s;pect to it, not meerly as a &s;ubordinate end, or meerly for the &s;ake of &s;omething el&s;e; but as that which they look upon in it&s;elf valuable, and in the high|e&s;t degree &s;o. It would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that in the&s;e ar|dent exclamations, they are only giving vent to their ve|hement benevolence to their fellow-creatures, and ex|pre&s;&s;ing their earne&s;t de&s;ires that God might be glorified, that &s;o his &s;ubjects may be made happy by the means. It is evident 'tis not &s;o much love, either to them&s;elves, or fellow-creatures, which they expre&s;s, as their exalted and &s;upream regard to the mo&s;t high and infinitely glo|rious Being. When the church &s;ays, "Not unto us, not unto us, O Jehovah, but to thy name give glory", it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that &s;he only de&s;ires that God may have glory, as a nece&s;&s;ary or convenient means of their own advancement and felicity. From the&s;e things it appears, by the eleventh po&s;ition, that God's glory is the end of the creation.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE &s;cripture leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that Chri&s;t &s;ought God's glory, as his highe&s;t and la&s;t end. Joh. 7. 18. "He that &s;peaketh of him&s;elf, &s;eeketh his own glory: but he that &s;eeketh his glory that &s;ent him, the &s;ame is true, and no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s is in him". When Chri&s;t &s;ays, he did not &s;eek his own glory, we cannot rea&s;onably un|der&s;tand him, that he had no regard to his own glory, e|ven the glory of the human nature; for the glory of that nature was part of the reward promi&s;ed him, and of the joy &s;et before him. But we mu&s;t under&s;tand him, that this was not his ultimate aim; it was not the end that chiefly governed his conduct: and therefore when, in oppo&s;ition to this, in the latter part of the &s;entence, he &s;ays, "But he that &s;eeketh his glory that &s;ent him, the &s;ame is true, &amp;c." 'tis natural from the antithe&s;is to under&s;tand him, that this was his ultimate aim, his &s;upream governing end. Joh. 12. 27, 28. "Now is my &s;oul troubled, and what &s;hall I &s;ay? Father, &s;ave me from this hour: But for this cau&s;e came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name". Chri&s;t was now going to Jeru&s;alem, and ex|pected in a few days there to be crucified: and the
<PB N="67" REF="009962_0073_0F7B3D417AD37A90">
pro&s;pect of his la&s;t &s;ufferings, in this near approach, was very terrible to him. Under this di&s;tre&s;s of mind, in &s;o terrible a view, he &s;upports him&s;elf with a pro&s;pect of what would be the con&s;equence of his &s;ufferings, viz. God's glory. Now, 'tis the end that &s;upports the agent in any difficult work that he undertakes, and above all others, his ultimate and &s;upream end. For this is above all others valuable in his eyes; and &s;o, &s;ufficient to countervail the difficulty of the means. That is the end, which is in it&s;elf agreable and &s;weet to him, which ultimately termi|nates his de&s;ires, is the center of re&s;t and &s;upport; and &s;o mu&s;t be the fountain and &s;um of all the delight and comfort he has in his pro&s;pects, with re&s;pect to his work. Now Chri&s;t has his &s;oul &s;traitned and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with a view of that which was infinitely the mo&s;t diffi|cult part of his work, which was ju&s;t at hand. Now certainly if his mind &s;eeks &s;upport in the conflict from a view of his end: it mu&s;t mo&s;t naturally repair to the highe&s;t end, which is the proper fountain of all &s;up|port in this ca&s;e. We may well &s;uppo&s;e, that when his &s;oul conflicts with the appearance of the mo&s;t extream difficulties, it would re&s;ort for &s;upport to the idea of his &s;u|pream and ultimate end, the fountain of all the &s;up|port and comfort he has in the means, or the work. The &s;ame thing, viz. Chri&s;t's &s;eeking the glory of God as his ultimate end, is manife&s;t by what Chri&s;t &s;ays, when he comes yet nearer to the hour of his la&s;t &s;uf|ferings, in that remarkable prayer, the la&s;t he ever made with his di&s;ciples, on the evening before his crucifixion; wherein he expre&s;&s;es the &s;um of his aims and de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">s. His fir&s;t words are, "Father, the hour is come, glorify thy &s;on, that thy &s;on al&s;o may glorify thee". As this is his fir&s;t reque&s;t, we may &s;uppo&s;e it to be his &s;upream re|que&s;t and de&s;ire, and what he ultimately aimed at in all. If we con&s;ider what follows to the end, all the re&s;t that is &s;aid in the prayer, &s;eems to be but an ampli|fication of this great reque&s;t.</P>
<P>ON the whole, I think it is pretty manife&s;t, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ought the glory of God as his highe&s;t and la&s;t end; and that therefore, by po&s;ition twelfth, this was God's la&s;t end in the creation of the world.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="68" REF="009962_0074_0F7B3D42460492B8">
7. 'TIS manife&s;t from &s;cripture, that God's glory is the la&s;t end of that great work of providence, the work of re|demption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is manife&s;t from what is ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, of its being the end ultimately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought by Je&s;us Chri&s;t the redeemer. And if we further con&s;ider the texts mentioned in the proof of that, and take notice of the context, it will be very evident, that it was what Chri&s;t &s;ought as his la&s;t end, in that great work which he came into the world upon, viz. to procure redemption for his people. It is manife&s;t that Chri&s;t profe&s;&s;es in Joh. 7. 18. that he did not &s;eek his own glory in what he did, but the glory of him that &s;ent him. He means that he did not &s;eek his own glory, but the glory of him that &s;ent him, in the work of his mini&s;try; the work he performed, and which he came into the world to perform, and which his father &s;ent him to work out, which is the work of redemp|tion. And with re&s;pect to that text, Joh. 12. 27, 28. it has been already ob&s;erved, that Chri&s;t comforted him&s;elf in the view of the extreme difficulty of his work, which was the work of redemption, in the pro&s;pect of that which he had re&s;pect to, and rejoiced in, as the highe&s;t, ultimate and mo&s;t valuable excellent end of that work, which he &s;et his heart mo&s;t upon, and delighted mo&s;t in. And in the an|&s;wer that the father made him from heaven at that time, in the latter part of the &s;ame ver&s;e, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again", the meaning plainly is, that God had glorified his name in what Chri&s;t had done, in the work he &s;ent him upon, and would glorify it again, and to a greater degree, in what he &s;hould further do, and in the &s;ucce&s;s thereof. Chri&s;t &s;hews that he under&s;tood it thus, in what he &s;ays upon it, when the people took no|tice of it, wondering at the voice; &s;ome &s;aying, that it thundered, others, that an angel &s;pake to him. Chri&s;t &s;ays, "This voice came not becau&s;e of me, but for your &s;akes". And then he &s;ays (exulting in the pro&s;pect of this glorious end and &s;ucce&s;s) "Now is the judgment of this world; now is the prince of this world ca&s;t out, &amp; I, if I be lift up from the earth, will draw all men unto me". In the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;ame work of redemption, he places his own glory, as was ob&s;erved before, in the&s;e words in the 23, and 24, ver&s;es of the &s;ame chapter. "The hour is come, that the &s;on of man &s;hould be glorified. Verily, verily I &s;ay unto
<PB N="69" REF="009962_0075_0F7B3D42F9578120">
you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit".</P>
<P>So it is manife&s;t that when he &s;eeks his own and his fa|ther's glory, in that prayer, Joh. 17. (which, it has been ob&s;erved, he then &s;eeks as his la&s;t end) he &s;eeks it as the end of that great work he came into the world upon, which he is now about to fini&s;h in his death. What follows thro' the whole prayer, plainly &s;hews this: and particularly the 4th. and 5th. ver&s;es. "I have glorified thee on earth: I have fini&s;hed the work which thou gave&s;t me to do. And now, O father, glorify thou me with thine own &s;elf". Here 'tis pretty plain that declaring to his father, that he had glorified him on earth, and fini&s;hed the work God gave him to do, meant that he had fini&s;hed the work which God gave him to do for this end, viz. that he might be glorified. He had now fini&s;hed that foundation that he came into the world to lay for his glory. He had laid a foundation for his father's obtaining his will, and the ut|mo&s;t that he de&s;igned. By which it is manife&s;t, that God's glory was the utmo&s;t of his de&s;ign, or his ultimate end in this great work.</P>
<P>AND 'tis manife&s;t by Joh. 13. 31, 32. that the glory of the father, and his own glory, are what Chri&s;t exulted in, in the pro&s;pect of his approaching &s;ufferings, when Judas was gone out to betray him, as the end his heart was mainly &s;et upon, and &s;upreamly delighted in. "Therefore when he was gone out, Je&s;us &s;aid, Now is the &s;on of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God &s;hall al&s;o glorify him in him&s;elf, and &s;hall &s;traitway glorify him".</P>
<P>THAT the glory of God is the highe&s;t and la&s;t end of the work of redemption, is confirmed by the &s;ong of the an|gels at Chri&s;t's birth. Luk. 2. 14. "Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth, peace and good-will towards men". It mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that they knew what was God's la&s;t end in &s;ending Chri&s;t into the world: and that in their re|joicing on the occa&s;ion of his incarnation, their minds would be mo&s;t taken up with, and would mo&s;t rejoice in that which was mo&s;t valuable and glorious in it; which
<PB N="70" REF="009962_0076_0F7B3D44A34094F8">
mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in its relation to that which was its chief and ultimate end. And we may further &s;uppo&s;e, that the thing which chiefly engaged their minds, as what was mo&s;t glorious and joyful in the affair, is what would be fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed in that &s;ong which was to expre&s;s the &s;entiments of their minds, and exultation of their hearts.</P>
<P>THE glory of the father and the &s;on is &s;poken of as the end of the work of redemption, in Phil. 2. 6,&mdash;11. very much in the &s;ame manner as in Joh. 12. 23, 28. and 13. 31, 32. and 17. 1, 4, 5. "Who being in the form of God,&mdash;made him&s;elf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a &s;ervant, and was made in the likene&s;s of men: and being found in fa&s;hion as a man, he humbled him&s;elf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cro&s;s: wherefore God al&s;o hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, &amp;c.&mdash;that at the name of Je&s;us every knee &s;hould bow,&mdash;and every tongue confe&s;s, that Je&s;us is the Lord, TO THE GLORY OF GOD THE FATHER". So God's glory, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the prai&s;e of his glory, is &s;poken of as the end of the work of redemption, in Eph 1. 3, &amp;c. "Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly places in Chri&s;t: according as he hath cho&s;en us in him.&mdash;Having prede&s;tinated us to the adoption of chil|dren,&mdash;TO THE PRAISE OF THE GLORY OF HIS GRACE". And in the continuance of the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e concerning the redemption of Chri&s;t, in follows in what the &s;ame chapter, God's glory is once and again mentioned as the great end of all. Several things belonging to that great redemption are mentioned in the following ver&s;es: &s;uch as God's great wi&s;dom in it, ver 8. The clearne&s;s of light grant|ed thro' Chri&s;t, ver. 9. God's gathering together in one, all things in heaven and earth in Chri&s;t, ver. 10. God's giving the chri&s;tians that were fir&s;t converted to the chri&s;ti|an faith from among the jews, an intere&s;t in this great re|demption, ver. 11. Then the great end is added, ver. 12. "That we &s;hould be TO THE PRAISE OF HIS GLORY, who fir&s;t tru&s;ted in Chri&s;t". And then is mentioned the be&s;tow|ing of the &s;ame great &s;alvation on the gentiles, in its be|ginning or fir&s;t fruits in the world, and in the compleating
<PB N="71" REF="009962_0077_0F7B3D453AFDD650">
it in another world, in the two next ver&s;es. And then the &s;ame great end is added again. "In whom ye al&s;o tru&s;ted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the go&s;pel of your &s;alvation: In whom al&s;o, after that ye believed, ye were &s;ealed with the holy &s;pirit of promi&s;e, which is the earne&s;t of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purcha&s;ed po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, UNTO THE PRAISE OF HIS GLORY". The &s;ame thing is expre&s;s'd much in the &s;ame manner, in 2 Cor. 4. 14, 15&mdash;"He which rai&s;ed up the Lord Je&s;us, &s;hall rai&s;e up us al&s;o by Je&s;us, and &s;hall pre&s;ent us with you. For all things are for your &s;akes, that the abundance of grace might thro' the thank&s;giving of many, redound TO THE GLORY OF GOD".</P>
<P>THE &s;ame is &s;poken of as the end of the work of re|demption in the old-te&s;tament. P&s;al. 79. 9. "Help us, O God of our &s;alvation, for the glory of thy name; deli|ver us and purge away our &s;ins, for thy name's &s;ake". So in the prophecies of the redemption of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I&s;ai. 44. 23. "Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: &s;hout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into &s;inging, ye mountains, O fore&s;t, and every tree there|in: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and GLORIFIED HIMSELF in I&s;rael." Thus the works of creation are call|ed upon to rejoice at the attaining of the &s;ame end, by the redemption of God's people, that the angels rejoiced at, when Chri&s;t was born. See al&s;o chap. 48. 10, 11. and 49. 3.</P>
<P>THUS 'tis evident that the glory of God is the ultimate end of the work of redemption.&mdash;Which is the chief work of providence towards the moral world, as is abun|dantly manife&s;t from &s;cripture: the whole univer&s;e being put in &s;ubjection to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; all heaven and earth, angels and men being &s;ubject to him, as executing this office: and put under him to that end, that all things may be order'd by him, in &s;ub&s;ervience to the great de&s;igns of his redemption: all power, as he &s;ays, being given to him, in heaven and in earth, that he may give eternal life to as many as the father has given him: and he being exalted far above all principality and power, and might and domi|nion, and made head over all things to the church. The angels being put in &s;ubjection to him, that he may employ

them all as mini&s;tring &s;pirits, for the good of them that &s;hall be the heirs of his &s;alvation: and all things being &s;o govern'd by their redeemer for them, that all things are theirs, whether things pre&s;ent or things to come: and all God's works of providence in the moral government of the world, which we have an account of in &s;cripture hi&s;tory, or that are foretold in &s;cripture prophecy, being evidently &s;ub|ordinate to the great purpo&s;es and ends of this great work. And be&s;ides, the work of redemption is that work, by which good men are, as it were, created, or brought into being, as good men, or as re&s;tored to holine&s;s and happi|ne&s;s. The work of redemption is a new creation, accord|ing to &s;cripture repre&s;entation, whereby men are brought into a new exi&s;tence, or are made new creatures.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e things it follows, according to the 5th, 6th, and 7th po&s;itions, that the glory of God is the la&s;t end of the creation of the world.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE &s;cripture leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that God's glory is his la&s;t end in his moral government of the world in ge|neral. This has been already &s;hewn concerning &s;everal things that belong to God's moral government of the world. As particularly, in the work of redemption, the chief of all his di&s;pen&s;ations, in his moral government of the world. And I have al&s;o ob&s;erved it, with re&s;pect to the duty which God requires of the &s;ubjects of his moral government, in requiring them to &s;eek his glory as their la&s;t end. And this is actually the la&s;t end of the moral goodne&s;s required of them; the end which gives their moral goodne&s;s its chief value. And al&s;o, that it is what that per&s;on which God has &s;et at the head of the moral world, as its chief governor, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;eeks as his chief end. And it has been &s;hewn, that it is the chief end for which that part of the moral world which are good, are made, or have their exi&s;tence as good. I now further ob|&s;erve, that this is the end of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the pub|lick wor&s;hip and ordinances of God among mankind. Hag. 1. 8. "Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the hou&s;e; and I will take plea&s;ure in it, and I will BE GLORIFIED, &s;aith the LORD." This is &s;poken of as the end of God's promi&s;es of rewards, and of their
<PB N="73" REF="009962_0079_0F7B3D46D02B86C0">
fulfilment. 2 Cor. 1. 20. "For all the promi&s;es of God in him are yea, and in him amen, TO THE GLORY OF GOD by us." And this is &s;poken of as the end of the executi|on of God's threatnings, in the puni&s;hment of &s;in. Num. 14. 20, 21, 22, 23. "And the LORD &s;aid, I have pardoned according to thy word. But as truly as I live, all the earth &s;hall be filled with THE GLORY OF JEHOVAH. Becau&s;e all the&s;e men, &amp;c&mdash;Surely they &s;hall not &s;ee the land." The glory of Jehovah is evidently here &s;poken of, as that which he had regard to, as his highe&s;t and ultimate end; which therefore he could not fail of; but mu&s;t take place every where, and in every ca&s;e, through all parts of his dominion, whatever became of men. And whatever a|batements might be made, as to judgments de&s;erved; and whatever changes might be made in the cour&s;e of God's proceedings, from compa&s;&s;ion to &s;inners; yet the attaining of God's glory was an end, which being ultimate and &s;u|pream, mu&s;t in no ca&s;e what&s;oever give place. This is &s;poken of as the end of God's executing judgments on his enemies in this world. Exod. 14. 17, 18 "And I will get me honour (<HI>Ikhabhedha,</HI> I will be glorified) upon Pha|roah, and upon all his ho&s;t, &amp;c." Ezek. 28. 22 "Thus &s;aith the Lord God, Behold I am again&s;t thee O Zion, and I WILL BE GLORIFIED in the mid&s;t of thee: And they &s;hall know that I am the Lord, when I &s;hall have executed judgments in her, and &s;hall be <HI>&s;anctified</HI> in her." So Ezek. 39. 13. "Yea, all the people of the land &s;hall bury them; and it &s;hall be to them a renown, the day <HI>that I &s;hall be glorified,</HI> &s;aith the Lord God." And this is &s;poken of as the end, both of the executions of wrath, and in the glo|rious exerci&s;es of mercy, in the mi&s;ery and happine&s;s of another world. Rom. 9. 22, 23. "What if God will|ing to &s;hew his wrath, and make his power known, endu|red with much long &s;uffering, the ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted to de&s;truction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the ve&s;&s;els of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory". And this is &s;poken of as the end of the day of judgment, which is the time appointed for the highe&s;t exerci&s;es of God's authority as moral governor of the world; and is as it were, the day of the con&s;umma|tion of God's moral government, with re&s;pect to all his &s;ubjects in heaven, earth and hell. 2 The&s;. 1. 9, 10. "Who
<PB N="74" REF="009962_0080_0F7B3D478671F6A0">
&s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre|&s;ence of the Lord, and from <HI>the glory of his power;</HI> when he &s;hall come <HI>to be glorified</HI> in his &s;aints, and <HI>to be admired</HI> in all them that believe". Then his glory &s;hall be obtained, with re&s;pect both to &s;aints and &s;inners.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e things it is manife&s;t by the fourth po&s;ition, that God's glory is the ultimate end of the creation of the world.</P>
<P N="9">9. IT appears from what has been already ob&s;erved, that the glory of God is &s;poken of in &s;cripture as the la&s;t end of many of God's works: and it is plain that this thing is in fact the i&s;&s;ue and re&s;ult of the works of God's common providence, and of the creation of the world. Let us take God's glory in what &s;en&s;e &s;o ever, con&s;i&s;tent with its be|ing &s;omething brought to pa&s;s, or a good attained by any work of God, certainly it is the con&s;equence of the&s;e works: and be&s;ides it is expre&s;sly &s;o &s;poken of in &s;cripture. This is implied in the 1st. ver. of the 8th. p&s;alm, wherein are celebrated the works of creation; the heavens being the work of God's fingers; the moon and the &s;tars being or|dained by God; and God's making man a little lower than the angels, &amp;c. The fir&s;t ver&s;e is, "O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who ha&s;t &s;et thy glory above the heavens", or upon the heavens. By <HI>name</HI> and <HI>glory,</HI> very much the &s;ame thing is intended here, as in many other places, as &s;hall be particularly &s;hewn af|terwards. So the p&s;alm concludes as it began. "O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth"! So in the 148th. p&s;alm, after a particular mention of mo&s;t of the works of creation, enumerating them in order, the p&s;al|mi&s;t &s;ays, ver. 13. "Let them prai&s;e the name of the Lord, for his name alone is excellent, his glory is above the earth and the heaven". And in in the 104th p&s;alm, after a very particular, orderly and magnificent repre&s;entation of God's works of creation and common providence, 'tis &s;aid in the 31st ver. "The glory of the Lord &s;hall endure forever: the Lord &s;hall rejoice in his works". Here God's glory is &s;poken of, as the grand re&s;ult, and ble&s;&s;ed con&s;equence of all the&s;e works, which God values, and on account of which he rejoices in the&s;e works. And this is one thing doubt|le&s;s
<PB N="75" REF="009962_0081_0F7B3D4839390088">
implied in the &s;ong of the &s;eraphim, I&s;ai. 6. 3. "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of ho&s;ts, the whole earth is full of his glory".</P>
<P>THE glory of God, in being the re&s;ult and con&s;equence of tho&s;e works of providence that have been mention'd, is in fact the con&s;equence of the creation. The good attain|ed in the u&s;e of a thing, made for u&s;e, is the re&s;ult of the making of that thing, as the &s;ignifying the time of day, when actually attained by the u&s;e of a watch, is the con&s;equence of the making of the watch. So that 'tis apparent that the glory of God is a thing that is actually the re&s;ult and con|&s;equence of the creation of the world. And from what has been already ob&s;erved, it appears, that 'tis what God &s;eeks as good, valuable and excellent in it&s;elf. And I pre&s;ume, none will pretend, that there is any thing peculi|ar in the nature of the ca&s;e, rendering it a thing valuable in &s;ome of the in&s;tances wherein it takes place, and not in others: or that the glory of God, tho' indeed an effect of all God's works, is an exceeding de&s;irable effect of &s;ome of them; but of others, a worthle&s;s and in&s;ignificant effect. God's glory therefore, mu&s;t be a de&s;irable, valuable con&s;e|quence of the work of creation. Yea 'tis expre&s;sly &s;poken of in P&s;al. 104 3. (as was ob&s;erved) as an effect, on ac|count of which, God rejoices and takes plea&s;ure in the works of creation.</P>

<P>As particularly, God's name is in like manner &s;poken of, as the end of his acts of goodne&s;s towards the good part of the moral world, and of his works of mercy and &s;alvation towards his people. As 1 Sam. 12. 22. "The Lord will not for&s;ake his people, <HI>for his great name's &s;ake."</HI> P&s;al. 23. 3. "He re&s;toreth my &s;oul, he leadeth me in the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>for his name's &s;ake."</HI> P&s;al. 31. 3. <HI>"For thy name's &s;ake</HI> lead me, and guide me." P&s;al. 109. 21. "But do thou for me,&mdash;<HI>for thy name's &s;ake."</HI> The forgivene&s;s of &s;in in particular, is often &s;poken of as being for God's <HI>name's &s;ake.</HI> 1 Joh. 2. 12. "I write unto you, little children, becau&s;e your &s;ins are forgiven you <HI>for his name's &s;ake."</HI> P&s;al. 25. 11. <HI>"For thy name's &s;ake,</HI> O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great." P&s;al. 79. 9. "Help us, O God of our &s;alvation, <HI>for the glory of thy name,</HI> and deliver us, and purge away our &s;ins, <HI>for thy name's &s;ake."</HI> Jer. 14. 7. "O Lord, though our iniquities te&s;tify again&s;t us, do thou it <HI>for thy name's &s;ake."</HI></P>
<P>THESE things &s;eem to &s;hew, that the &s;alvation of Chri&s;t is for God's name's &s;ake. Leading and guiding in the way of &s;afety and happine&s;s, re&s;toring the &s;oul, the forgive|ne&s;s of &s;in, and that help, deliverance and &s;alvation, that is con&s;equent thereon, is <HI>for God's name.</HI> And here 'tis ob|&s;ervable, that tho&s;e two great temporal &s;alvations of God's people, the redemption from Egypt, and that from Baby|lon, that are often repre&s;ented as figures and &s;imilitudes of the redemption of Chri&s;t, are frequently &s;poken of as being wrought <HI>for God's name's &s;ake.</HI> So is that great work of God, in delivering his people from Egypt, carrying them through the wilderne&s;s to their re&s;t in Canaan. 2 Sam. 7. 23. "And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like I&s;rael, whom God went to redeem for a people to him&s;elf, and to <HI>make him a name."</HI> P&s;al. 106. 8.

from time to time, <HI>"I wrought for my name's &s;ake,</HI> that it &s;hould not be polluted before the heathen," as in ver. 9. 14, 22. See al&s;o Jo&s;h. 7. 8, 9. Dan. 9 15. So is the redemption from the Babyloni&s;h captivity. I&s;ai. 48. 9, 10. <HI>"For my name's &s;ake</HI> will I defer mine anger.&mdash;For mine own &s;ake, even for mine own &s;ake will I do it, for how &s;hould <HI>my name</HI> be polluted?" In Ezek. 36. 21, 22, 23. the rea&s;on is given for God's mercy in re&s;toring I&s;rael. "But I had pity for my holy name.&mdash;Thus &s;aith the Lord, I do not this for your &s;akes, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, but <HI>for my holy name's &s;ake;</HI>&mdash;And I will <HI>&s;anctify my great name,</HI> which was profan'd among the heathen." And chap. 39. 25. "Therefore thus &s;aith the Lord God, now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole hou&s;e of I&s;rael, <HI>and will be jealous for my holy name."</HI> Daniel prays that God would forgive his people, and &s;hew them mercy <HI>for his own &s;ake.</HI> Dan. 9. 19.</P>
<P>WHEN God from time to time &s;peaks of &s;hewing mer|cy, and exerci&s;ing goodne&s;s and promoting his people's happine&s;s for his <HI>name's &s;ake,</HI> we can't under&s;tand it as of a meerly &s;ubordinate end. How ab&s;urd would it be to &s;ay, that he promotes their happine&s;s for his name's &s;ake, in &s;ubordination to their good; and that his name may be exalted only for their &s;akes, as a means of promoting their happine&s;s! e&s;pecially when &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e are u&s;ed, "For mine own &s;ake, even for mine own &s;ake will I do it, for how &s;hould my name be polluted?" and "Not for your &s;akes do I this, but for my holy name's &s;ake".</P>
<P>AGAIN, 'tis repre&s;ented as tho' God's people had their exi&s;tence, at lea&s;t as God's people, for God's name's &s;ake. God's redeeming or purcha&s;ing them, that they might be his people, <HI>for his name,</HI> implies this. As in that pa&s;&s;age mentioned before, 2 Sam. 7. 23.&mdash;"Thy peo|ple I&s;rael, whom God went to redeem for a people to him|&s;elf, and <HI>to make him a name".</HI> So God's making them a people for his name, is implied in Jer. 13. 11. "For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, &s;o have I cau&s;ed to cleave unto me the whole hou&s;e of I&s;rael &amp;c.&mdash;that they may be unto me for a people, <HI>and for a name."</HI> Act.

<P>THIS al&s;o is &s;poken of as the end of the virtue and re|ligion, and holy behaviour of the &s;aints. Rom. 1. 5. "By whom we have received grace and appo&s;tle&s;hip, for obedi|ence to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith among all nations <HI>for his name."</HI> Matt. 19. 29.

"Becau&s;e that <HI>for his name's &s;ake</HI> they went forth, taking nothing of the gentiles." Rev. 2. 3. "And ha&s;t born, and ha&s;t patience, and <HI>for my name's &s;ake</HI> ha&s;t laboured, and ha&s;t not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ainted."</P>
<P>AND we find that holy per&s;ons expre&s;s their de&s;ire of this, and their joy in it, in the &s;ame manner as in the glory of God. 2 Sam. 7. 26. "Let thy name be mag|nified forever." P&s;al. 76. 1. "In Judah is God known, his name is great in I&s;rael." P&s;al. 148. 13. "Let them prai&s;e the name of the Lord; for his name alone is excel|lent, his glory is above the earth, and heaven." P&s;al. 135. 13. "Thy name O Lord, endureth forever, and thy memorial throughout all generations." I&s;ai. 12. 4. "De|clare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted."</P>
<P>THE judgments God executes on the wicked, are &s;poken of as being <HI>for the &s;ake of his name,</HI> in like manner as for his glory. Exod. 9. 16. "And in very deed for this cau&s;e have I rai&s;ed thee up, for to &s;hew in thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth". Neh. 9. 10. "And &s;hewed&s;t &s;igns and wonders upon Pharaoh, &amp; on all his &s;ervants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewed&s;t that they dealt proudly again&s;t them: &s;o did&s;t thou <HI>get thee a name</HI> as at this day".</P>
<P>AND this is &s;poken of as a con&s;equence of the works of creation, in like manner as God's glory. P&s;al. 8. 1. "O Lord, <HI>how excellent is thy name</HI> in all the earth! who ha&s;t &s;et thy glory above the heavens". And then at the con|clu&s;ion
<PB N="79" REF="009962_0085_0F7B3D4BF9453D58">
of the ob&s;ervations on the works of creation, the p&s;alm ends thus (ver. 9.) "O Lord, our Lord, <HI>how excel|lent is thy name</HI> in all the earth". So P&s;al. 148. 13. after a particular mention of the various works of creation, "Let them prai&s;e the name of the Lord, for his name alone is excellent in all the earth, his glory is above the earth and the heaven".</P>
<P>So we find manife&s;tation, or making known God's <HI>per|fections,</HI> his <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>excellency,</HI> is &s;poken of very much in the &s;ame manner as God's glory.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal &s;criptures which would lead us to &s;uppo&s;e this to be the great thing that God &s;ought of the moral world, and the end aimed at in the moral agents, which he had created, wherein they are to be active in an&s;wering their end. This &s;eems implied in that argu|ment God's people &s;ometimes made u&s;e of, in deprecating a &s;tate of death and de&s;truction: that in &s;uch a &s;tate, they can't know or make known the glorious excellency of God. P&s;al. 88. 18, 19. "Shall thy loving kindne&s;s be declared in the grave, or thy faithfulne&s;s in de&s;truction? Shall thy wonders be known in the dark, and thy righte|ou&s;ne&s;s in the land of forgetfulne&s;s"? So P&s;al. 30. 9. I&s;ai. 38. 18, 19. The argument &s;eems to be this: Why &s;hould we peri&s;h? and how &s;hall thine end, for which thou ha&s;t made us, be obtained in a &s;tate of de&s;tructi|on, in which thy glory cannot be known or decla|red?</P>
<P>THIS is &s;poken of as the end of the good part of the moral world, or the end of God's people in the &s;ame man|ner as the glory of God. I&s;ai. 43. 21. "This people have I formed for my&s;elf, they &s;hall &s;hew forth my <HI>prai&s;e".</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 9.

<P>PLACES of &s;cripture from whence it may be argued, that <HI>communication of good to the creature,</HI> was one thing which God had in view, as an ultimate end of the crea|on of the world.</P>
<P N="1">1. ACCORDING to the &s;cripture, communicating good to the creatures, is what is in it&s;elf plea&s;ing to God: and that this is not meerly &s;ubordinately agreable, and e&s;teemed va|luable on account of its relation to a further end, as it is in executing ju&s;tice in puni&s;hing the &s;ins of men; which God is inclined to as fit and nece&s;&s;ary in certain ca&s;es, and on the account of good ends attained by it: but what God is inclined to on its own account, and what he delights in &s;imply and ultimately. For tho' God is &s;ometimes in &s;crip|ture &s;poken of as taking plea&s;ure in puni&s;hing men's &s;ins, Deut. 28. 63. "The Lord will rejoice over you, to de&s;troy you". Ezek. 5. 13. "Then &s;hall mine anger be accom|pli&s;hed, and I will cau&s;e my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ury to re&s;t upon them, and I will be comforted". Yet God is often &s;poken o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as exer|ci&s;ing goodne&s;s and &s;hewing mercy, with delight, in a man|ner quite different, and oppo&s;ite to that of his executing wrath. For the latter is &s;poken of as what God proceeds to with backwardne&s;s and reluctance; the mi&s;ery of the creature being not agreable to him on its own account. Neh. 9. 17 "That thou art a God ready to pardon, gra|cious and merciful, &s;low to anger, and of great loving kindne&s;s". P&s;al. 103. 8. "The Lord is merciful &amp; gracious, &s;low to anger, and plenteous in mercy". P&s;al. 145. 8. "The Lord is gracious and full of compa&s;&s;ion, &s;low to an|ger, and of great mercy". We have again almo&s;t the &s;ame words, Jonah 4. 2. Mic. 7. 10. "Who is a God like thee, that pardoneth iniquity, &amp;c&mdash;He retaineth not his anger forever, becau&s;e he delighteth in mercy". Ezek. 18. 32. "I have no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth, &s;aith the Lord God; wherefore turn your&s;elves, and live ye". Lam. 3. 33. "He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men". Ezek. 33. 11. "As I live, &s;aith the Lord God, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live:
<PB N="87" REF="009962_0093_0F7B3D52BAECCB08">
turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael". 2 Pet. 3. 9. "Not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to re|pentance".</P>
<P N="2">2. THE work of redemption wrought out by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is &s;poken of in &s;uch a manner as being from the grace and love of God to men, that does not well con&s;i&s;t with his &s;eeking a communication of good to them, only &s;ubordi|nately, i. e. not at all from any inclination to their good di|rectly, or delight in giving happine&s;s to them, &s;imply and ultimately con&s;ider'd; but only indirectly, and wholly from a regard to &s;omething entirely diver&s;e, which it is a means of. Such expre&s;&s;ions as that in Joh. 3. 16. carry another idea. "God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only be|gotten &s;on, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life". And 1 Joh. 4. 9. 10. "In this was manife&s;ted the love of God towards us, be|cau&s;e that God &s;ent his only begotten &s;on into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love; not that we loved God but that he loved us, and &s;ent his &s;on to be a propitiation for our &s;ins". So Eph. 2. 4. "But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, &amp;c". But if indeed this was only from love to &s;ome|thing el&s;e, and a regard to a further end, entirely diver&s;e from our good; then all the love is truly terminated in that, its ultimate object! and God's love con&s;i&s;ts in regard towards that: and therein is God's love, and therein is his love manife&s;ted, &s;trictly and properly &s;peaking, and not in that he loved us, or exerci&s;ed &s;uch high regard towards us. For if our good be not at all regarded ultimately, but only &s;ubordinately, then our good or intere&s;t is in it&s;elf con|&s;idered, nothing in God's regard or love: God's re&s;pect is all terminated upon, and &s;wallowed up in &s;omething diver&s;e, which is the end, and not in the means.</P>
<P>So the &s;cripture every where repre&s;ents concerning Chri&s;t, as tho' the great things that he did and &s;uffered, were in the mo&s;t direct and proper &s;en&s;e, from exceeding love to us; and not as one may &s;hew kindne&s;s to a per&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o who&s;e intere&s;t, &s;imply and in it&s;elf con&s;idered, he is intirely in|different, only as it may be a means of promoting the in|tere&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="009962_0094_0F7B3D538B470A08">
of another (that is indeed directly regarded) which is connected with it. Thus the apo&s;tle Paul repre&s;ents the matter, Gal. 2. 20. "Who loved me, and gave him&s;elf for me". Eph. 5. 25. "Husbands love your wives, even as Chri&s;t loved the church, and gave him&s;elf for it". And Chri&s;t him&s;elf, Joh. 17. 19, "For their &s;akes I &s;anctify my&s;elf". And the &s;cripture repre&s;ents Chri&s;t as re&s;ting in the &s;alvation and glory of his people, when obtain'd, as in what he ultimately &s;ought, as having therein reached the goal at the end of his race; obtained the prize he aimed at; enjoying the travail of his &s;oul, in which he is &s;atisfied, as the recompence of his labours and extreme agonies. I&s;ai. 53. 10, 11. "When thou &s;hall make his &s;oul an of|fering for &s;in, he &s;hall &s;ee his &s;eed, he &s;hall prolong his days, and the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per in his hand. He &s;hall &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and &s;hall be &s;atisfied: by his knowledge &s;hall my righteous &s;ervant ju&s;tify many, for he &s;hall bear their iniquities". He &s;ees the travail of his &s;oul, in &s;eeing his &s;eed, the children brought forth in the i&s;&s;ue of his travail. This implies that Chri&s;t has his delight, mo&s;t truly and properly, in obtaining the &s;alvation of his church, not meerly as a means conducing to the thing which terminates his delight and joy; but as what he rejoices and is &s;atisfied in, mo&s;t directly and properly: as do tho&s;e &s;criptures, which repre&s;ent him as rejoicing in his obtaining this fruit of his labour and purcha&s;e, as the bridegroom, when he obtains his bride. I&s;ai. 62. 5. "As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, &s;o &s;hall thy God rejoice over thee". And how emphatical and &s;trong to the purpo&s;e, are the expre&s;&s;ions in Zeph. 3. 17. "The Lord thy God in the mid&s;t of thee is mighty; he will &s;ave, he will rejoice over thee with joy: he will re&s;t in his love, he will rejoice over thee with &s;inging". The &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> may be argued from Prov. 8. 30, 31. "Then was I by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him: rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the &s;ons of men". And from tho&s;e places that &s;peak of the &s;aints as God's portion, his jewels and peculiar trea&s;ure. The&s;e things are abundantly confirmed by what is related, Joh. 12. 23.&mdash;32. But the particular con&s;ideration of what

<P N="3">3. THE communications of divine goodne&s;s, particularly forgivene&s;s of &s;in, and &s;alvation, are &s;poken of from time to time, as being for God's goodne&s;s &s;ake, and for his mercies &s;ake, ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner as they are &s;poken of, as being for God's name's &s;ake, in places ob&s;erved be|fore. P&s;al. 25. 7. "Remember not the &s;ins of my youth, nor my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: according to thy mercy remember thou me, <HI>for thy goodne&s;s &s;ake,</HI> O Lord". In the 11th. ver. the p&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, "For thy name's &s;ake, O Lord pardon mine iniquity". Neh. 9. 31. "Neverthele&s;s <HI>for thy great mercies &s;ake,</HI> thou ha&s;t not utterly con&s;umed them, nor for|&s;aken them; for thou art a gracious and a merciful God". P&s;al. 6. 4. "Return O Lord, deliver my &s;oul: O &s;ave me for thy mercies &s;ake". P&s;al. 31. 16. "Make thy to face &s;hine upon thy &s;ervant: &s;ave me <HI>for thy mercies &s;ake."</HI> P&s;al. 44. 26. "Ari&s;e for our help; redeem us <HI>for thy mercies &s;ake."</HI> And here it may be ob&s;erved, after what a remarkable manner God &s;peaks of his love to the children of I&s;rael in the wil|derne&s;s, as tho' his love were for love's &s;ake, and his good|ne&s;s were its own end and motive. Deut. 7. 7, 8. "The Lord did not &s;et his love upon you, nor choo&s;e you, becau&s;e ye were more in number than any people, for ye were the fewe&s;t of all people; <HI>but becau&s;e the Lord loved you."</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THAT the government of the world in all parts of it, is for the good of &s;uch as are to be the eternal &s;ubjects of God's goodne&s;s, is implied in what the &s;cripture teaches us of Chri&s;t's being &s;et at God's right hand, made king of an|gels and men; &s;et at the head of the univer&s;e, having all p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er given him in heaven und earth, to that end that he may promote their happine&s;s; being made head over all things to the church, and having the government of the whole creation for their good.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. 1. 20, 21, 22, 23.

&s;abbath, that "the &s;abbath was made for man". And if &s;o, we may in like manner argue, that <HI>all things</HI> were made for man, that the &s;on of man is made Lord of all things.</P>
<P N="5">5. THAT God u&s;es the whole creation, in his whole go|vernment of it, for the good of his people, is mo&s;t ele|gantly repre&s;ented in Deut. 33. 26. "There is none like the God of Je&s;hurun, who rideth on the heavens in thine help, and in his excellency on the &s;ky". The whole univer&s;e is a machine, which God hath made for his own u&s;e&punc; to be his chariot for him to ride in; as is re|pre&s;ented in Ezekiels vi&s;ion. In this chariot God's &s;eat, or throne is heaven, where he &s;its, who u&s;es and governs and rides in this chariot (Ezek. 1. 22, 26, 27, 28.) The in|ferior part of the creation, this vi&s;ible univer&s;e, &s;ubject to &s;uch continual changes and revolutions, are the wheels of the chariot, under the place of the &s;eat of him who rides in this chariot. God's providence in the con&s;tant revolu|tions and alterations and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive events, is repre&s;ented by the motion of the wheels of the chariot, by the &s;pirit of him who &s;its in his throne on the heavens, or above the firmament. Mo&s;es tells us for who&s;e &s;ake it is that God moves the wheels of this chariot, or rides in it &s;itting in his heavenly &s;eat; and to what end he is making his progre&s;s, or goes his appointed journey in it, viz. the &s;alvation of his people.</P>
<P N="6">6. GOD's judgments on the wicked in this world, and al&s;o their eternal damnation in the world to come, are &s;po|ken of as being for the happine&s;s of God's people. So are his judgments on them in this World. I&s;ai. 43. 3, 4. "For I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of I&s;rael, thy &s;aviour. I gave Egypt for thy ran&s;om, Ethiopia and Seba for thee. Since thou ha&s;t been precious in my &s;ight, thou ha&s;t been honorable, and I have loved thee; therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life". So the works of God's vindictive ju&s;tice and wrath, are &s;poken of as works of mercy to his people, P&s;al. 136. 10. 15, 17, 18, 19, 20. And &s;o is their eternal damnation in another world. Rom. 9. 22. 23. "What if God, willing to &s;hew his wrath and make his power known, endured with much long &s;uffering,
<PB N="91" REF="009962_0097_0F7B3D5758A693D0">
the ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted to de&s;truction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the ve&s;&s;els of mer|cy, which he had afore prepared unto glory". Here it is evident the la&s;t ver&s;e comes in, in connect on with the fore|going, as giving another rea&s;on of the de&s;truction of the wicked, viz. the &s;hewing the riches of his glory on the ve&s;&s;els of mercy; in higher degrees of their glory and happine&s;s, in an advancement of their reli&s;h of their own enjoyments, and greater &s;en&s;e of their value, and of God's free grace in the be&s;towment.</P>
<P N="7">7. IT &s;eems to argue that God's goodne&s;s to them who are to be the eternal &s;ubjects of his goodne&s;s, is the end of the creation, that the whole creation, in all parts of it, and all God's di&s;po&s;als of it, is &s;poken of as THEIR'S. 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23. "All things are yours. Whether Paul, or A|pollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things pre&s;ent, or things to come, all are yours". The terms are very univer&s;al; and both works of creation and providence are mentioned: and 'tis manife&s;tly the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle to be under&s;tood of every work of God what&s;oever. Now, how can we under&s;tand this any otherwi&s;e, than that all things are for their benefit; and that God made and u&s;es all for their good?</P>
<P N="8">8. ALL God's works, both his works of creation and providence, are repre&s;ented as works of goodne&s;s or mercy to his people in the 136th. p&s;alm. His wonderful works in general, ver. 4. "To him who alone doth great won|ders; for his mercy endureth forever". The works of creation in all parts of it. Ver. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. "To him that by wi&s;dom made the heavens; for his mercy endureth forever. To him that &s;tretched out the earth above the waters; for his mercy endureth forever. To him that made great lights; for his mercy endureth forever. The &s;un to rule by day; for his mercy endureth forever. The moon and &s;tars to rule by night; for his mercy endureth forever". And God's works of providence, in the follow|ing part of the p&s;alm.</P>

9. THAT expre&s;&s;ion in the ble&s;&s;ed &s;entence pronounced on the righteous at the day of judgment, "Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world", &s;eems to hold forth as much, as that the eternal expre&s;&s;ions and fruits of God's goodne&s;s to them, was God's end in creating the world, and in his providential di&s;po&s;als ever &s;ince the creation: that God in all his works, in lay|ing the foundation of the world, and ever &s;ince the founda|tion of it, had been preparing this kingdom and glory for them.</P>
<P N="10">10. AGREABLE to this, the good of men is &s;poken of as an ultimate end of the virtue of the moral world. Rom. 13. 8, 9, 10. "He that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou &s;halt not commit adultery, Thou &s;halt not kill, &amp;c.&mdash;And if there be any other command|ment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. <HI>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law".</HI> Gal. 5. 14. "All the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf". Jam. 2. 8. "If ye fulfill the royal law, according to the &s;cripture, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf, thou &s;halt do well".</P>
<P>IF the good of the creature be one end of God in all things he does; and &s;o be one end of all things that he requires moral agents to do; and an end they &s;hould have re&s;pect to in all that they do, and which they &s;hould re|gulate all parts of their conduct by; the&s;e things may be ea&s;ily explained: but otherwi&s;e it &s;eems difficult to be ac|counted for, that the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hould thus expre&s;s him|&s;elf from time to time. The &s;cripture repre&s;ents it to be the &s;pirit of all true &s;aints, to perfer the welfare of God's people to their chief joy. And this was the &s;pirit of Mo&s;es and the prophets of old: and the good of God's church was an end they regulated all their conduct by. And &s;o it was with the apo&s;tles. 2 Cor. 4. 15. "For all things are for your &s;akes." 2 Tim. 2. 10. "I endure all things for the elects &s;ake, that they may al&s;o obtain the &s;alvation which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, with eternal glory." And the &s;criptures repre&s;ent as though every chri&s;tian

&s;hould in all things he does be employed for the good of God's church, as each particular member of the body, is in all things employed, for the good of the body. Rom. 12. 4, 5. &amp;c. Eph. 4. 15, 16. 1 Cor. 12. 12, 25. to the end; together with the whole of the next chapter. To this end the &s;cripture teaches us the angels are continually employed. Heb. 1. 14.</P>

<P>WHEREIN is con&s;idered what is meant by the GLORY OF GOD, and the NAME OF GOD in &s;cripture, when &s;poken of as GOD's end in his works.</P>
<P>HAVING thus con&s;idered what things are &s;poken of in the holy &s;criptures, as the ends of God's works; and in &s;uch a manner as ju&s;tly to lead us to &s;uppo&s;e, they were the ends which God had ultimately in view, in the creati|on of the world: I now proceed particularly to enquire concerning &s;ome of the&s;e things, what they are, and how the terms are to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>I BEGIN fir&s;t, with the GLORY OF GOD.</P>
<P>AND here I might ob&s;erve, that the phra&s;e, <HI>the glory of God,</HI> is &s;ometimes manife&s;tly u&s;ed to &s;ignify the &s;econd per|&s;on in the Trinity. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary at this time to con&s;ider that matter, or &s;tand to prove it from particular pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture. Omitting this therefore, I proceed to ob&s;erve concerning the hebrew word <HI>Cabh&ograve;dh,</HI> which is the word mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed in the old te&s;tament where we have the word <HI>glory</HI> in the engli&s;h bible. The root which it comes from is either the verb <HI>Cabhadh,</HI> which &s;ig|nifies to be heavy, or make heavy, or from the adjective <HI>C&agrave;bh&egrave;dh,</HI> which &s;ignifies heavy or weighty. The&s;e, as &s;eems pretty manife&s;t, are the primary &s;ignifications of the&s;e words, though they have al&s;o other meanings, which &s;eem to be derivative. The noun <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bh&egrave;dh</HI> &s;ignifies gra|vity, heavine&s;s, greatne&s;s and abundance. Of very many places it will be &s;ufficient to name a few. Prov. 27. 3. 2 Sam. 14. 26. 1 King. 12. 11. P&s;al. 38. 4. I&s;ai. 30.
<PB N="94" REF="009962_0100_0F7B3D59809D8438">
27. And as the weight of bodies ari&s;es from two things, viz. &s;olidity or den&s;ity, or &s;pecific gravity, as it is called, and their magnitude; &s;o we find the word <HI>Cabhedh</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ignify den&s;e, as in Exod. 19. 16. <HI>Gnanatz Cobhedh</HI> a den&s;e cloud. And it is very often u&s;ed for great. I&s;ai. 32. 2. Gen. 5. 9. 1 King. 10. 2. 2 King. 6. 14. and 18. 17. I&s;ai. 36. 2. and other places.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Cabhodh,</HI> which is commonly tran&s;lated glory, is u&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as might be expected from this &s;ignification of the words from whence it comes. Some|times it is u&s;ed to &s;ignify what is infernal, what is within the being or per&s;on inherent, in the &s;ubject, or what is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the per&s;on: and &s;ometimes for emanation, exhibition or communication of this internal glory: and &s;ometimes for the knowledge or &s;en&s;e, or effect of the&s;e, in tho&s;e who behold it, to whom the exhibition or com|munication is made; or an expre&s;&s;ion of this knowledge or &s;en&s;e or effect. And here I would note, that agreable to the u&s;e of the word <HI>Cabhodh</HI> in the old te&s;tament, is that of the word <HI>Doxa</HI> in the new. For as the word <HI>Cabhodh</HI> is generally tran&s;lated by <HI>Doxa</HI> in the &s;eptu|agint; &s;o 'tis apparent, that this word is de&s;igned to be u&s;ed to &s;ignify the &s;ame thing in the new te&s;tament, with <HI>Cabhodh</HI> in the old. This might be abundantly proved by comparing particular places of the old te&s;tament; but probably it will not be denied.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE proceed particularly to con&s;ider the&s;e words, with regard to their u&s;e in &s;cripture, in each of the forementioned ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to internal glory. When the word is u&s;ed to &s;ignify what is within, inherent or in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, it very commonly &s;ignifies excellency, or great valu|ablene&s;s, dignity, or worthine&s;s or regard. This accord|ing to the hebrew <HI>idiom,</HI> is as it were the <HI>weight</HI> of a thing, as that by which it is heavy; as to be <HI>light,</HI> is to be worth|le&s;s, without value, contemptible. Num. 21. 5. "This <HI>light</HI> bread." 1 Sam. 18. 23, "Seemeth it a <HI>light</HI> thing." Judg. 9. 4. "<HI>Light</HI> per&s;ons," i. e. worthle&s;s, vain, vile per&s;ons. So Zeph. 3. 4.

2 THE word glory, is u&s;ed in &s;cripture often to expre&s;s the exhibition, emanation or communication of the inter|nal glory. Hence it often &s;ignifies a vi&s;ible exhibition of glory; as in an effulgence or &s;hining brightne&s;s, by an emanation of beams of light. Thus the brightne&s;s of the &s;un and moon and &s;tars is called their glory in 1 Cor. 15. 41. But in particular, the word is very often thus u&s;ed, when applied to God and Chri&s;t. As in Ezek. 1. 28. "As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, &s;o was the appearance of the brightne&s;s round about. This was the appearance of the likene&s;s of the glory of the Lord." And chap. 10. 4. "Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub, and &s;tood over the thre&s;hold of the hou&s;e, and the hou&s;e was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightne&s;s of the Lord's glory." I&s;ai. 6. 1, 2, 3. "I &s;aw the Lord &s;itting upon a throne high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

<P>THE word <HI>glory,</HI> as applied to God or Chri&s;t, &s;ometimes evidently &s;ignifies the communications of God's fulne&s;s and means much the &s;ame thing, with God's abundant and exceeding goodne&s;s and grace. So Eph. 2. 16. "That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be &s;trengthned with might, by his &s;pirit in the inner man." The expre&s;&s;ion, "According to the riches of his glory", is apparently equivalent to that in the &s;ame epi&s;tle, chap. 1. 7. "According to the riches of his grace". And chap. 2. 7. "The exceeding riches of his grace in his kindne&s;s towards us, thro' Chri&s;t Je&s;us". In like manner is the word <HI>glory</HI> u&s;ed in Phil. 4. 19. "But my God &s;hall

&s;upply all your need, according to his riches in glory, by Chri&s;t Je&s;us". And Rom. 9. 23. "And that he might make known the riches of his glory, on the ve&s;&s;els of mer|cy". In this, and the foregoing ver&s;e, the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of God's making known two things, his great wrath, and his rich grace. The former, on the ve&s;&s;els of wrath, ver. 22. The latter, which he calls <HI>the riches of his glory,</HI> on the ve&s;&s;els of mercy, ver. 23. So when Mo&s;es &s;ays, "I be|&s;eech thee &s;hew me thy <HI>glory;"</HI> God granting his reque&s;t, makes an&s;wer, "I will make all my <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> to pa&s;s before thee." Exod. 33. 18, 19.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">DR. Goodwin ob&s;erves (vol. 1. of his works, part 2d, page 166.) that riches of grace are called <HI>riches of glory</HI> in &s;crip|ture.

<P>WHAT we find in Joh. 12. 23,&mdash;32. is worthy of particular notice in this place. The words and behaviour of Chri&s;t, which we have an account of here, argue two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the happine&s;s and &s;alvation of men, was an end that Chri&s;t ultimately aimed at in the labours and &s;ufferings he went through, for our redemption (and con|&s;equently, by what has been before ob&s;erved, an ultimate end of the work of creation.) The very &s;ame things which were ob&s;erved before in this pa&s;&s;age (chap. &s;econd, &s;ect. third) concerning God's glory, are equally, and in the &s;ame manner ob&s;ervable, concerning the &s;alvation of men. As it was there ob&s;erved, that Chri&s;t in the great
<PB N="100" REF="009962_0106_0F7B3D5EB90F1DE0">
conflict of his &s;oul, in the view of the near approach of the mo&s;t extreme difficulties which attended his undertaking, comforts him&s;elf in a certain pro&s;pect of obtaining the end he had chiefly in view. It was ob&s;erved that the glory of God is therefore mention'd and dwelt upon by him, as what his &s;oul &s;upported it&s;elf and re&s;ted in, as this great end. And at the &s;ame time, and exactly in the &s;ame man|ner, is the &s;alvation of men mentioned and in&s;i&s;ted on, as the end of the&s;e great labours and &s;ufferings, which &s;atis|fied his &s;oul, in the pro&s;pect of undergoing them. Com|pare the 23<HI>d</HI> and 24<HI>th</HI> ver&s;es; and al&s;o the 28<HI>th</HI> and 29<HI>th</HI> ver&s;es; ver. 31. and 32.  And,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE glory of God, and the emanations and fruits of his grace in man's &s;alvation, are &s;o &s;poken of by Chri&s;t on this occa&s;ion in ju&s;t the &s;ame manner, that it would be quite unnatural, to under&s;tand him as &s;peaking of two di&s;tinct things. Such is the connection, that what he &s;ays of the latter, mu&s;t mo&s;t naturally be under&s;tood as ex|egetical of the former. He fir&s;t &s;peaks of his own glory and the glory of his father, as the great end that &s;hould be obtained by what he is about to &s;uffer; and then ex|plains and amplifies what he &s;ays on this, in what he ex|pre&s;&s;es of the &s;alvation of men that &s;hall be obtained by it. Thus in the 23. ver. he &s;ays, "The hour is come that the &s;on of man &s;hould be glorified." And in what next follows, he evidently &s;hews how he was to be glorified, or wherein his glory con&s;i&s;ted: "Verily, verily I &s;ay unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground, and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." As much fruit is the glory of the &s;eed, &s;o is the multitude of redeemed ones, which &s;hould &s;pring from his death, his glory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HERE may be remembered what was before ob&s;erved of the church's being &s;o often &s;poken of as the glory and fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</NOTE> So concerning the glory of his father, in the 27<HI>th,</HI> and following ver&s;es. "Now is my &s;oul troubled, and what &s;hall I &s;ay! Father, &s;ave me from this hour? But for this cau&s;e came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from
<PB N="101" REF="009962_0107_0F7B3D60A04F06D0">
heaven, &s;aying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again." In an a&s;&s;urance of this, which this voice declared, Chri&s;t was greatly comforted, and his &s;oul even exulted under the view of his approaching &s;ufferings. And what this glory was, in which Chri&s;t's &s;oul was &s;o comforted on this occa&s;ion, his own words which he then &s;pake, plainly &s;hew. When the people &s;aid it thundered; and others &s;aid, an angel &s;pake to him; then Chri&s;t explains the matter to them, and tells them what this voice meant. Ver. 30, 31, 32. "Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid, This voice came not becau&s;e of me, but for your &s;akes. Now is the judgment of this world; now &s;hall the prince of this world be ca&s;t out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me." By this behaviour, and the&s;e &s;peeches of our redeemer, it appears that the expre&s;&s;ions of divine grace, in the &s;anctification and happine&s;s of the re|deemed, are e&s;pecially that glory of his, and his father, which was the joy that was &s;et before him, for which he endured the cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;hame: and that this glory e&s;pecially, was the end of the travail of his &s;oul, in obtaining which end he was &s;atisfied, agreable to I&s;ai. 53. 10, 11.</P>
<P>THIS is agreable to what has been ju&s;t ob&s;erved, of God's glory being &s;o often repre&s;ented by an effulgence, or emanation, or communication of light, from a luminary or fountain of light. What can be thought of, that &s;o na|turally and aptly repre&s;ents the emanation of the internal glory of God; or the flowing forth, and abundant com|munication of that infinite fulne&s;s of good that is in God? Light is very often in &s;cripture put for comfort, joy, hap|pine&s;s and for good in general.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 6. 3.&mdash;"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of ho&s;ts, the whole earth is full of his glory." In the original, <HI>His glory is the fulne&s;s of the whole earth:</HI> which &s;ignifies much more than the words of the tran&s;lation. God's glory, con&s;i&s;ting e&s;pecially in his holine&s;s, is that, in the &s;ight or communica|tions of which man's fulne&s;s, i. e. his holine&s;s and happine&s;s, con&s;i&s;ts. By God's glory here, there &s;eems to be re&s;pect to that train, or tho&s;e effulgent beams that filled the temple: the&s;e beams &s;ignifying God's glory &s;hining forth, and com|municated. This effulgence or communication is the ful|ne&s;s of all intelligent creatures, who have no fulne&s;s of their own.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="009962_0108_0F7B3D61433CB858">
AGAIN, the word <HI>glory,</HI> as applied to God in &s;cripture, implies the view or knowledge of God's excellency. The exhibition of glory, is to the view of beholders. The ma|nife&s;tation of glory, the emanation or effulgence of bright|ne&s;s, has relation to the eye. Light or brightne&s;s is a quality that has relation to the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing: we &s;ee the luminary by it's light. And knowledge is often expre&s;&s;ed in &s;cripture by light. The word <HI>glory</HI> very often in &s;cripture &s;ignifies or implies <HI>honor,</HI> as any one may &s;oon &s;ee by ca&s;ting his eye on a concordance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See particularly Heb. 3. 3.</NOTE> But honor implies the knowledge of the dignity and excellency of him who hath the honor. And this is often more e&s;pecially &s;ignified by the word <HI>glo|ry,</HI> when applied to God. Num. 14. 21. "But as truly as I live, all the earth &s;hall be filled with the glory of the Lord." i. e. All the earth &s;hall &s;ee the manife&s;tations I will make of my perfect holine&s;s and hatred of &s;in, and &s;o of my infinite excellence. This appears by the context. So Ezek. 39. 21, 22, 23. "And I will &s;et my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen <HI>&s;hall &s;ee</HI> my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them. So the hou&s;e of I&s;rael <HI>&s;hall know</HI> that I am the Lord their God. And the heathen <HI>&s;hall know,</HI> that the hou&s;e of I&s;rael went into captivity for their iniquity." And 'tis manife&s;t in many places, where we read of God's glorifying him&s;elf, or of his being glorified, that one thing directly intended, is a manife&s;ting or making known his divine greatne&s;s and excellency.</P>
<P>AGAIN, glory, as the word is u&s;ed in &s;cripture, often &s;ig|nifies or implies <HI>prai&s;e.</HI> This appears from what was ob|&s;erved before, that glory very often &s;ignifies honor, which is much the &s;ame thing with prai&s;e, viz. high e&s;teem and re|&s;pect of heart, and the expre&s;&s;ion and te&s;timony of it in words and actions. And 'tis manife&s;t that the words <HI>glo|ry</HI> and <HI>prai&s;e,</HI> are often u&s;ed as equivalent expre&s;&s;ions in
<PB N="203" REF="009962_0109_0F7B3D61CF8A2E10">
&s;cripture. P&s;al. 50. 23. "Who&s;o offereth prai&s;e, glorifi|eth me". P&s;al. 22. 23. "Ye that fear the Lord, prai&s;e him; all ye &s;eed of I&s;rael, glorify him". I&s;ai. 42. 8. "My glory I will not give unto another, nor my prai&s;e to graven images". Ver. 12. "Let them give glory unto the Lord, and declare his prai&s;e in the i&s;lands". I&s;ai. 48. 9, 10, 11. "For my name's &s;ake will I defer mine anger; for my prai&s;e will I refrain for thee.&mdash;For mine own &s;ake will do it; for&mdash;I will not give my glory unto ano|ther". Jer. 13. 11. "That they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a prai&s;e, and for a glory". Eph. 1. 6. "To the prai&s;e of the glory of his grace". Ver. 12. "To the prai&s;e of his glory". So ver. 14. The phra&s;e is apparently equivalent to that, Phil. 1. 11. "Which are by Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto the prai&s;e and glory of God". 2 Cor. 4. 15. "That the abundant grace might, thro' the thank&s;|giving of many, redound to the glory of God"</P>
<P>IT is manife&s;t the <HI>prai&s;e of God,</HI> as the phra&s;e is u&s;ed in &s;cripture, implies the high e&s;teem and love of the heart, ex|alting thoughts of God, and complacence in his excellence and perfection.

<P>HAVING thus con&s;idered what is implied in the phra&s;e, THE GLORY OF GOD, as we find it u&s;ed in &s;cripture; I proceed to enquire what is meant by the <HI>name</HI> of God.</P>
<P>AND I ob&s;erve that 'tis manife&s;t that God's name and his glory, at lea&s;t very often, &s;ignify the &s;ame thing in &s;crip|ture. As it has been ob&s;erved concerning the glory of God, that it &s;ometimes &s;ignifies the &s;econd per&s;on in the trinity; the &s;ame might be &s;hewn of the name of God, if it were needful in this place. But that the name and glory of God are often equipollent expre&s;&s;ions, is manife&s;t by Exod. 33. 18, 19. When Mo&s;es &s;ays, "I be&s;eech thee, &s;hew me thy glory",: and God grants his reque&s;t, he &s;ays, "I will pro|claim the <HI>name</HI> of the Lord before thee". P&s;al. 8. 1.

<P>So 'tis evident that by <HI>name</HI> is &s;ometimes meant much the &s;ame thing as prai&s;e, by &s;everal places which have been ju&s;t mentioned, as I&s;ai. 48. 9. Jer. 13. 11. Deut. 26, 19.

<P>SHEWING that the ultimate end of the creation of the world, is BUT ONE, and what THAT ONE END is.</P>
<P>FROM what has been ob&s;erved in the la&s;t &s;ection, it ap|pears, that however the la&s;t end of the creation is &s;poken of in &s;cripture under various denominations; yet if the whole of what is &s;aid relating to this affair, be duly weigh|ed, and one part compared with another, we &s;hall have rea&s;on to think, that the de&s;ign of the &s;pirit of God don't &s;eem to be to repre&s;ent God's ultimate end as manifold, but as one. For tho' it be &s;ignified by various names, yet they appear not to be names of different things, but various names involving each other in their meaning; either dif|ferent names of the &s;ame thing, or names of &s;everal parts of one whole, or of the &s;ame whole viewed in various lights, or in its different re&s;pects and relations. For it appears that all that is ever &s;poken of in the &s;cripture as an ultimate end of God's works, is included in that one phra&s;e, <HI>the glo|ry of God;</HI> which is the name by which the la&s;t end of God's works is mo&s;t commonly called in &s;cripture; and &s;eems to be the name which mo&s;t aptly &s;ignifies the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hing.</P>

THE thing &s;ignified by that name, <HI>the glory of God,</HI> when &s;poken of as the &s;upream and ultimate end of the work of creation, and of all God's works, is the emanation and true external expre&s;&s;ion of God's internal glory and fulne&s;s; meaning by his fulne&s;s, what has already been explained. Or in other words, God's internal glory extant, in a true and ju&s;t exhibition, or external exi&s;tence of it. It is con|fe&s;&s;ed that there is a degree of ob&s;curity in the&s;e definitions: but perhaps an ob&s;curity which is unavoidable, thro' the imperfection of language, and words being le&s;s fitted to ex|pre&s;s things of &s;o &s;ublime a nature. And therefere the thing may po&s;&s;ibly be better under&s;tood, by u&s;ing many words and a variety of expre&s;&s;ions, by a particular con&s;ideration of it, as it were by parts, than by any &s;hort defini|tion.</P>
<P>THERE is included in this, the exerci&s;e of God's perfec|tions to produce a proper effect, in oppo&s;ition to their lying eternally dormant and ineffectual: as his power being eter|nally without any act or fruit or that power; his wi&s;dom eter|nally ineffectual in any wi&s;e production, or prudent di&s;po&s;al of any thing, &amp;c. The manife&s;tation of his internal glory to created under&s;tandings. The communication of the in|finite fulne&s;s of God to the creature. The creature's high e&s;teem of God, love to God, and complacence and joy in God; and the proper exerci&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE at fir&s;t view may appear to be entirely di&s;tinct things: but if we more clo&s;ely con&s;ider the matter, they will all appear to be one thing, in a variety of views and re|lations. They are all but the emanation of God's glory; or the excellent brightne&s;s and fulne&s;s of the divinity diffu|&s;ed, overflowing, and as it were enlarged; or in one word, <HI>exi&s;ting ad extra.</HI> God's exerci&s;ing his perfection to produce a proper effect, is not di&s;tinct from the emanation or com|munication of his fulne&s;s: for this is the effect, viz. his fulne&s;s communicated, and the producing this effect is the communication of his fulne&s;s; and there is nothing in this effectual exerting of God's perfection, but the emanation of God's internal glory. The emanation or communication, is of the internal glory or fulne&s;s of God, as it is. Now God's internal glory, as it is in God, is either in his under&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="108" REF="009962_0114_0F7B3D65D4A5B888">
or will. The glory or fulne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, is his knowledge. The internal glory and fulne&s;s of God, which we mu&s;t conceive of as having its &s;pecial &s;eat in his will, is his holine&s;s and happine&s;s. The whole of God's internal good or glory, is in the&s;e three things, viz. his in|finite knowledge; his infinite vertue or holine&s;s, and his infinite joy and happine&s;s. Indeed there are a great many attributes in God, according to our way of conceiving or talking of them: but all may be reduced to the&s;e; or to the degree, circum&s;tances and relations of the&s;e. We have no conception of God's power, different from the degree of the&s;e things, with a certain relation of them to effects. God's infinity is not &s;o properly a di&s;tinct kind of good in God, but only expre&s;&s;es the <HI>degree</HI> of the good there is in him. So God's eternity is not a di&s;tinct good; but is the duration of good. His immutability is &s;till the &s;ame good, with a negation of change. So that, as I &s;aid, the fulne&s;s of the God-head is the fulne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, con|&s;i&s;ting in his knowledge, and the fulne&s;s of his will, con&s;i&s;t|ing in his vertue and happine&s;s. And therefore the exter|nal glory of God con&s;i&s;ts in the communication of the&s;e. The communication of his knowledge is chiefly in giving the knowledge of him&s;elf: for this is the knowledge in which the fulne&s;s of God's under&s;tanding chiefly con&s;i&s;ts. And thus we &s;ee how the manife&s;tation of God's glory to created under&s;tandings, and their &s;eeing and knowing it, is not di&s;tinct from an emanation or communication of God's fulne&s;s, but clearly implied in it. Again, the communica|tion of God's vertue or holine&s;s, is principally in commu|nicating the love of him&s;elf (which appears by what has before been ob&s;erved.) And thus we &s;ee how, not only the creature's &s;eeing and knowing God's excellence, but al&s;o &s;upreamly e&s;teeming and loving him, belongs to the com|munication of God's fulne&s;s. And the communication of God's joy &amp; happine&s;s, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in communicating to the creature, that happine&s;s and joy, which con&s;i&s;ts in rejoic|ing in God, and in his glorious excellency; for in &s;uch joy God's own happine&s;s does principally con&s;i&s;t. And in the&s;e things, viz. in knowing God's excellency, loving God for it, and rejoicing in it; and in the exerci&s;e and expre&s;&s;ion of of the&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts God's honor and prai&s;e: &s;o that the&s;e are clearly implied in that glory of God, which
<PB N="109" REF="009962_0115_0F7B3D6639AC0DA8">
con&s;i&s;ts in the emanation of his internal glory. And tho' we &s;uppo&s;e all the&s;e things, which &s;eem to be &s;o various, are &s;ignified by that <HI>glory,</HI> which the &s;cripture &s;peaks of as the la&s;t end of all God's works; yet it is manife&s;t there is no greater, and no other variety in it, than in the internal and e&s;&s;ential glory of God it&s;elf. God's internal glory is partly in his under&s;tanding, and partly in his will. And this internal glory, as &s;eated in the will of God, implies both his holine&s;s and his happine&s;s: both are evidently God's glo|ry, according to the u&s;e of the phra&s;e. So that as God's external glory is only the emanation of his internal glory, this variety nece&s;&s;arily follows. And again, it hence ap|pears that here is no other variety or di&s;tinction, but what nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es from the di&s;tinct faculties of the creature, to which the communication is made, as created in the image of God; even as having the&s;e two faculties of un|der&s;tanding and will. God communicates him&s;elf to the under&s;tanding of the creature, in giving him the knowledge of his glory; and to the will of the creature, in giving him holine&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting primarily in the love of God: and in giving the creature happine&s;s, chiefly con&s;i&s;ting in joy in God. The&s;e are the &s;um of that emanation of divine ful|ne&s;s called in &s;cripture, <HI>the glory of God.</HI> The fir&s;t part of this glory, is called <HI>truth,</HI> the latter, <HI>grace.</HI> Joh. 1. 14. "We beheld his <HI>glory,</HI> the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>truth".</HI></P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee that the great and la&s;t end of God's works which is &s;o variou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed in &s;cripture, is indeed but <HI>one;</HI> and this <HI>one</HI> end is mo&s;t properly and comprehen&s;ively called, THE GLORY OF GOD; by which name it is mo&s;t commonly called in &s;cripture. And is fitly compared to an effulgence or emanation of light from a luminary, by which this glory of God is abundantly repre&s;ented in &s;cripture. Light is the external expre&s;&s;ion, exhibition and manife&s;tation of the excellency of the luminary, of the &s;un for in&s;tance: It is the abundant, exten&s;ive emanation and communication of the fulne&s;s of the &s;un to innumerable beings that partake of it. 'Tis by this that the &s;un it&s;elf is &s;een, and his glory beheld, and all other things are di&s;covered: 'tis by a par|ticipation of this communication from the &s;un, that &s;ur|rounding objects receive all their lu&s;tre, beauty and bright|ne&s;s.

<P>WHAT has been &s;aid may be &s;ufficient to &s;hew how tho&s;e things, which are &s;poken of in &s;cripture as ultimate ends of God's works, tho' they may &s;eem at fir&s;t view to be di&s;tinct, are all plainly to be reduced to this one thing, viz. God's internal glory or fulne&s;s extant externally, or exi&s;ting in its emanation. And tho' God in &s;eeking this end, &s;eeks the creature's good; yet therein appears his &s;upreme regard to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE emanation or communication of the divine fulne&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting in the knowledge of God, love to God, and joy in God, has relation indeed both to God, and the crea|ture: but it has relation to God as its fountain, as it is an emanation from God; and as the communication it&s;elf, or thing communicated, is &s;omething divine, &s;omething of God, &s;omething of his internal fulne&s;s; as the water in the &s;tream is &s;omething of the fountain; and as the beams of the &s;un, are &s;omething of the &s;un. And again, they have relation to God, as they have re&s;pect to him as their
<PB N="111" REF="009962_0117_0F7B3D67B926A168">
object: for the knowledge communicated is the knowledge of God; and &s;o God is the object of the knowledge: and the love communicated, is the love of God; &s;o God is the object of that love: and the happine&s;s communicated, is joy in God; and &s;o he is the object of the joy communicated. In the creature's knowing, e&s;teeming, loving, rejoicing in, and prai&s;ing God, the glory of God is both exhibited and acknowledged; his fulne&s;s is received and returned. Here is both an <HI>emanation,</HI> and <HI>remanation.</HI> The refulgence &s;hines upon and into the creature, and is reflected back to the luminary. The beams of glory come from God, and are &s;omething of God, and are refunded back again to their ori|ginal. So that the whole is <HI>of</HI> God, and <HI>in</HI> God; and <HI>to</HI> God; and God is the beginning, middle and end in this affair.</P>
<P>AND tho' it be true that God has re&s;pect to the creature in the&s;e things; yet his re&s;pect to him&s;elf, and to the crea|ture in this matter, are not properly to be looked upon, as a double and divided re&s;pect of God's heart. What has been &s;aid in chap. 1. &s;ect. 3, 4, may be &s;ufficient to &s;hew this. Neverthele&s;s, it may not be ami&s;s here briefly to &s;ay a few things; tho' they are mo&s;tly implied in what has been &s;aid already.</P>
<P>WHEN God was about to create the world, he had re|&s;pect to that emanation of his glory, which is actually the con&s;equence of the creation, ju&s;t as it is with regard to all that belongs to it, both with regard to its relation to him|&s;elf, and the creature. He had regard to it, as an ema|nation from him&s;elf, and a communication of him&s;elf, and as the thing communicated, in its nature returned to him|&s;elf, as its final term. And he had regard to it al&s;o, as the emanation was to the creature, and as the thing commu|nicated was in the creature, as its &s;ubject. And God had regard to it in this manner, as he had a &s;upreme regard to him&s;elf, and value for his own infinite internal glory. It was this value for him&s;elf that cau&s;ed him to value and &s;eek that his internal glory &s;hould flow forth from him&s;elf. It was from his value for his glorious perfections of wi&s;|dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c.&mdash;that he valued the proper exerci&s;e and effect of the&s;e perfections&punc; in wi&s;e and righte|ous acts and effects. It was from his infinite value for his
<PB N="112" REF="009962_0118_0F7B3D6983FCE790">
internal glory and fulne&s;s, that he valued the thing it&s;elf, which is communicated, which is &s;omething of the &s;ame, extant in the creature. Thus, becau&s;e he infinitely values his own glory, con&s;i&s;ting in the knowledge of him|&s;elf, love to him&s;elf, and complacence and joy in him&s;elf; he therefore valued the image, communication or partici|pation of the&s;e, in the creature. And 'tis becau&s;e he values him&s;elf, that he delights in the knowledge and love and joy of the creature; as being him&s;elf the object of this know|ledge, love and complacence. For it is the nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence of the true e&s;teem and love of any per&s;on or being (&s;uppo&s;e a &s;on or friend) that we &s;hould approve and value others e&s;teem of the &s;ame object, and di&s;approve and di&s;|like the contrary. For the &s;ame rea&s;on is it the con&s;e|quence of a being's e&s;teem and love of him&s;elf, that he &s;hould approve of others e&s;teem and love of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THUS 'tis ea&s;y to conceive, how God &s;hould &s;eek the good of the creature, con&s;i&s;ting in the creature's knowledge and holine&s;s, and even his happine&s;s, from a &s;upreme re|gard to him&s;elf; as his happine&s;s ari&s;es from that which is an image and participation of God's own beauty; and con&s;i&s;ts in the creature's exerci&s;ing a &s;upreme regard to God and complacence in him; in beholding God's glory, in e&s;teeming and loving it, and rejoicing in it, and in his exerci&s;ing and te&s;tifying love and &s;upream re&s;pect to God: which is the &s;ame thing with the creature's exalting God as his chief good, and making him his &s;upream end.</P>
<P>AND though the emanation of God's fulne&s;s which God intended in the creation, and which actually is the con&s;e|quence of it&punc; is to the creature as it's object, and the crea|ture is the &s;ubject of the fulne&s;s communicated, and is the creature's good; and was al&s;o regarded as &s;uch, when God &s;ought it as the end of his works: yet it don't nece&s;|&s;arily follow, that even in &s;o doing, he did not make him|&s;elf his end. It comes to the &s;ame thing. God's re&s;pect to the creature's good, and his re&s;pect to him&s;elf, is not a divided re&s;pect; but both are united in one, as the hap|pine&s;s of the creature aimed at, is happine&s;s in union with him&s;elf. The creature is no further happy with this hap|pine&s;s which God makes his ultimate end, than he becomes
<PB N="113" REF="009962_0119_0F7B3D6A1774B320">
one with God. The more happine&s;s the greater union: when the happine&s;s is perfect, the union is perfect. And as the happine&s;s will be increa&s;ing to eternity, the union will become more and more &s;trict and perfect; nearer &amp; more like to that between God the Father, and the Son; who are &s;o united, that their intere&s;t is perfectly one. If the happine&s;s of the creature be con&s;idered as it will be, in the whole of the creature's eternal duration, with all the infi|nity of its progre&s;s, and infinite increa&s;e of nearne&s;s and u|nion to God; in this view, the creature mu&s;t be looked upon as united to God in an infinite &s;trictne&s;s.</P>
<P>IF God has re&s;pect to &s;omething in the creature, which he views as of everla&s;ting duration, and as ri&s;ing higher and higher thro' that infinite duration, and that not with con|&s;tantly dimini&s;hing (but perhaps an increa&s;ing) celerity: then he has re&s;pect to it, as, in the whole, of infinite height; though there never will be any particular time when it can be &s;aid already to have come to &s;uch an height.</P>
<P>LET the mo&s;t perfect union with God, be repre&s;ented by &s;omething at an infinite height above us; and the eternally increa&s;ing union of the &s;aints with God, by &s;omething that is a&s;cending con&s;tantly towards that infinite height, moving upwards with a given velocity; and that is to continue thus to move to all eternity. God who views the whole of this eternally increa&s;ing height, views it as an infinite height. And if he has re&s;pect to it, and makes it his end, as in the whole of it, he has re&s;pect to it as an infinite height, tho' the time will never come when it can be &s;aid it has alrea|dy arrived at this infinite height.</P>
<P>GOD aims at that which the motion or progre&s;&s;ion which he cau&s;es, aims at, or tends to. If there be many things &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o made and appointed, that by a con&s;tant and eternal motion, they all tend to a certain center; then it appears that he who made them and is the cau&s;e of their motion, aimed at that center, that term of their motion, to which they eternally tend, and are eternally, as it were, &s;triving after. And if God be this center; then God aimed at him&s;elf. And herein it appears, that as he is the fir&s;t author of their being and motion, &s;o he is the
<PB N="114" REF="009962_0120_0F7B3D6AC6E5A7D0">
la&s;t end, the final term, to which is their ultimate tendency and aim.</P>
<P>WE may judge of the end that the creator aimed at, in the being, nature and tendency he gives the creature, by the mark or term which they con&s;tantly aim at in their ten|dency and eternal progre&s;s; though the time will never come, when it can be &s;aid it is attained to, in the mo&s;t ab|&s;olutely perfect manner.</P>
<P>BUT if &s;trictne&s;s of union to God be viewed as thus in|finitely exalted; then the creature mu&s;t be regarded as in|finitely, nearly and clo&s;ely united to God. And viewed thus, their intere&s;t mu&s;t be viewed as one with God's in|tere&s;t; and &s;o is not regarded properly with a disjunct and &s;eparate, but an undivided re&s;pect. And as to any diffi|culty of reconciling God's not making the creature his ultimate end, with a re&s;pect properly di&s;tinct from a re|&s;pect to him&s;elf; with his benevolence and free grace, and the creatures obligation to gratitude, the reader mu&s;t be refer'd to chap. 1. &s;ect. 4. obj. 4. where this objection has been con&s;ider'd and an&s;wer'd at large.</P>
<P>IF by rea&s;on of the &s;trictne&s;s of the union of a man and his family, their intere&s;t may be looked upon as one, how much more one is the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t and his church, (who&s;e fir&s;t union in heaven is un&s;peakably more perfect and exalted, than that of an earthly father and his family) if they be con&s;idered with regard to their eternal and in|crea&s;ing union? Doubtle&s;s it may ju&s;tly be e&s;teemed as &s;o much one, that it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be aimed at and &s;ought, not with a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate, but an undivid|ed re&s;pect.</P>
<P>'TIS certain that what God aimed at in the creation of the world, was the good that would be the con&s;e|quence of the creation, in the whole continuance of the thing created.</P>
<P>'TIS no &s;olid objection again&s;t God's aiming at an infi|nitely perfect union of the creature with him&s;elf, that the particular time will never come when it can be &s;aid, the
<PB N="115" REF="009962_0121_0F7B3D6B8A1C8428">
union is now infinitely perfect. God aims at &s;atisfying ju&s;tice in the eternal damnation of &s;inners; which will be &s;atisfied by their damnation, con&s;idered no otherwi&s;e than with regard to its eternal duration. But yet there never will come that particular moment, when it can be &s;aid, that now ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied. But if this don't &s;atisfy our modern free-thinkers, who don't like the talk about &s;atis|fying ju&s;tice with an infinite puni&s;hment; I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be denied by any, that God, in glorifying the &s;aints in heaven with eternal felicity, aims to &s;atisfy his infinite grace or benevolence, by the be&s;towment of a good infi|nitely valuable, becau&s;e eternal: and yet there never will come the moment, when it can be &s;aid, that now this infi|nitely valuable good has been actually be&s;towed.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing wherein the e&s;&s;ence of true virtue con&s;i&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER controver&s;ies and variety of opinions there are about the nature of virtue, yet all (ex|cepting &s;ome &s;ceptics, who deny any real difference between virtue and vice) mean by it &s;omething <HI>beautiful,</HI> or rather &s;ome kind of <HI>beauty,</HI> or excellency.&mdash;'Tis not <HI>all</HI> beauty, that is called virtue; for in&s;tance, not the beau|ty of a building, of a flower, or of the rainbow: but &s;ome beauty belonging to Beings that have <HI>perception</HI> and <HI>will</HI>&mdash;'Tis not all beauty of <HI>mankind,</HI> that is called virtue; for in&s;tance, not the external beauty of the countenance, or &s;hape, gracefulne&s;s of motion, or harmony of voice: but it is a beauty that has its original &s;eat in the mind.&mdash;But yet perhaps not <HI>every</HI> thing that may be called a beauty of mind, is properly called virtue. There is a beauty of un|der&s;tanding and &s;peculation. There is &s;omething in the ideas and conceptions of great philo&s;ophers and &s;tate&s;men, that may be called beautiful; which is a different thing from what is mo&s;t commonly meant by virtue. But virtue is the beauty of tho&s;e qualities and acts of the mind, that are of a <HI>moral</HI> nature, i. e. &s;uch as are attended with de&s;ert or worthine&s;s of <HI>prai&s;e,</HI> or <HI>blame.</HI> Things of this &s;ort, it is generally agreed, &s;o far as I know, are not any thing belong|ing meerly to &s;peculation; but to the <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> or (to u&s;e a general word, I &s;uppo&s;e commonly well under&s;tood) to the <HI>heart.</HI> Therefore I &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;hall not depart from the common opinion, when I &s;ay, that virtue is the beau|ty
<PB N="117" REF="009962_0123_0F7B3D6CF965F070">
of the qualities and exerci&s;es of the heart, or tho&s;e acti|ons which proceed from them. So that when it is enquired, what is the nature of true <HI>virtue?</HI> This is the &s;ame as to enquire, what that is which renders any habit, di&s;po&s;ition, or exerci&s;e of the heart truly <HI>beautiful?</HI>&mdash;I u&s;e the phra&s;e <HI>true</HI> virtue, and &s;peak of things <HI>truly</HI> beautiful, be|cau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e it will generally be allowed, that there is a di&s;tinction to be made between &s;ome things which are truly virtuous, and others which only &s;eem to be virtuous, thro' a partial and imperfect view of things: that &s;ome actions and di&s;po&s;itions appear beautiful, if con&s;idered partially and &s;uperficially, or with regard to &s;ome things belonging to them, and in &s;ome of their circum&s;tances and tendencies, which would appear otherwi&s;e in a more exten&s;ive &amp; com|prehen&s;ive view, wherein they are &s;een clearly in their whole nature and the extent of their connections in the u|niver&s;ality of things.&mdash;There is a general and a particu|lar beauty. By a <HI>particular</HI> beauty, I mean that by which a thing appears beautiful when con&s;idered only with regard to its connection with, &amp; tendency to &s;ome particular things within a limited, and as it were, a private &s;phere. And a <HI>general</HI> beauty is that by which a thing appears beautiful when viewed mo&s;t perfectly, comprehen&s;ively and univer|&s;ally, with regard to all its tendencies, and its connections with every thing it &s;tands related to.&mdash;The former may be without and again&s;t the latter. As, a few notes in a tune, taken only by them&s;elves, and in their relation to one another, may be harmonious; which, when con&s;idered with re&s;pect to all the notes in the tune, or the entire &s;eries of &s;ound, they are connected with, may be very di&s;cordant and di&s;agreable. (Of which more afterwards)&mdash;<HI>That only</HI> therefore, is what I mean by true virtue, which is <HI>that,</HI> be|longing to the <HI>heart</HI> of an intelligent Being, that is beauti|ful by a <HI>general</HI> beauty, or beautiful in a comprehen&s;ive view as it is in it&s;elf, and as related to every thing that it &s;tands in connection with. And therefore when we are inquiring concerning the nature of true virtue, viz. where|in this true and general beauty of the heart does mo&s;t e&s;|&s;entially con&s;i&s;t,&mdash;this is my an&s;wer to the inquiry&mdash;</P>
<P>TRUE virtue mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts in benevolence to Being in general. Or perhaps to &s;peak more accurately,
<PB N="118" REF="009962_0124_0F7B3D6F1C60DCB0">
it is that con&s;ent, propen&s;ity and union of heart to Being in general, that is immediately exerci&s;ed in a general good-will.</P>
<P>THE things which were before ob&s;erved of the nature of true virtue, naturally lead us to &s;uch a notion of it. If it has its &s;eat in the heart, and is the general goodne&s;s and beauty of the di&s;po&s;ition and exerci&s;e of that, in the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive view, con&s;idered with regard to its univer|&s;al tendency, and as related to every thing that it &s;tands in connection with; what can it con&s;i&s;t in, but a con&s;ent and good-will to Being in general?&mdash;Beauty does not con&s;i&s;t in di&s;cord and di&s;&s;ent, but in con&s;ent and agreement. And if every intelligent Being is &s;ome way related to Being in general, and is a part of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem of exi&s;tence; and &s;o &s;tands in connection with the whole; what can its general and true beauty be, but its union and con&s;ent with the great whole.</P>
<P>IF any &s;uch thing can be &s;uppo&s;ed as an union of heart to &s;ome particular Being, or number of Beings, di&s;po&s;ing it to benevolence to a private circle or &s;y&s;tem of Beings, which are but a &s;mall part of the whole; not implying a tenden|cy to an union with the great &s;y&s;tem, and not at all incon|&s;i&s;tent with enmity towards Being in general; this I &s;up|po&s;e not to be of the nature of true virtue: altho' it may in &s;ome re&s;pects be good, and may appear beautiful in a confined and contracted view of things.&mdash;But of this more afterwards.</P>
<P>IT is abundantly plain by the holy &s;criptures, and gene|rally allowed, not only by chri&s;tian divines, but by the more con&s;iderable dei&s;ts, that virtue mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts in love. And I &s;uppo&s;e, it is owned by the mo&s;t con&s;iderable writers, to con&s;i&s;t in general love of benevolence, or kind affection: tho', it &s;eems to me, the meaning of &s;ome in this affair is not &s;ufficiently explained; which perhaps oc|ca&s;ions &s;ome error or confu&s;ion in di&s;cour&s;es on this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;ay, true virtue con&s;i&s;ts in love to Being in ge|neral, I &s;hall not be likely to be under&s;tood, that no one
<PB N="119" REF="009962_0125_0F7B3D6FB9C41DD0">
act of the mind or exerci&s;e of love is of the nature of true virtue, but what has Being in general, or the great &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al exi&s;tence, for its direct and immediate object: &s;o that no exerci&s;e of love or kind affection to any one par|ticular Being, that is but a &s;mall part of this whole, has any thing of the nature of true virtue.&mdash;But, that the nature of true virtue con&s;i&s;ts in a di&s;po&s;ition to benevolence towards Being in general. Tho', from &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition may ari&s;e exerci&s;es of love to particular Beings, as objects are pre&s;ented and occa&s;ions ari&s;e. No wonder, that he who is of a generally benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, &s;hould be more di&s;po&s;ed than another to have his heart moved with bene|volent affection to particular Per&s;ons, whom he is ac|quainted and conver&s;ant with, and from whom ari&s;e the greate&s;t and mo&s;t frequent occa&s;ions for exciting his bene|volent temper.&mdash;But my meaning is, that no affections towards particular per&s;ons, or Beings, are of the nature of true virtue, but &s;uch as ari&s;e from a generally benevolent temper, or from that habit or frame of mind, wherein con&s;i&s;ts a di&s;po&s;ition to love Being in general.</P>
<P>AND perhaps it is needle&s;s for me to give notice to my readers, that when I &s;peak of an intelligent Being's having a heart united and benevolently di&s;po&s;ed to Being in gene|ral, I thereby mean <HI>intelligent</HI> Being in general. Not inani|mate things, or Beings that have no perception or will; which are not properly capable objects of benevolence.</P>
<P>LOVE is commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed into love of benevo|lence and love of complacence.&mdash;Love of <HI>benevolence</HI> is that affection or propen&s;ity of the heart to any Being, which cau&s;es it to incline to its well-being, or di&s;po&s;es it to de&s;ire and take plea&s;ure in its happine&s;s. And if I mi&s;take not, 'tis agreable to the common opinion, that beauty in the object is not always the ground of this propen&s;ity: but that there may be &s;uch a thing as benevolence, or a di&s;po&s;ition to the welfare of tho&s;e that are not con&s;idered as beautiful; unle&s;s mere exi&s;tence be accounted a beauty. And bene|volence or goodne&s;s in the divine Being is generally &s;uppo|&s;ed, not only to be prior to the beauty of many of its ob|jects, but to their exi&s;tence: &s;o as to be the ground both of their exi&s;tence and their beauty, rather than they the
<PB N="120" REF="009962_0126_0F7B3D7006420918">
foundation of God's benevolence; as 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed that it is God's goodne&s;s which moved him to give them both Being and beauty. So that if all virtue primarily con&s;i&s;ts in that affection of heart to Being, which is, exerci&s;ed in benevolence, or an inclination to its good, then God's ver|tue is &s;o extended as to include a propen&s;ity not only to Being actually exi&s;ting, &amp; actually beautiful, but to po&s;&s;ible Being, &s;o as to incline him to give Being, beauty and hap|pine&s;s&mdash;But not now to in&s;i&s;t particularly on this&mdash;What I would have ob&s;erved at pre&s;ent, is, that it mu&s;t be allowed, benevolence doth not nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;uppo&s;e beau|ty in its object.</P>
<P>WHAT is commonly called love of <HI>complacence,</HI> pre&s;uppo|&s;es beauty.&mdash;For it is no other than delight in beauty; or complacence in the per&s;on or Being beloved for his beauty.</P>
<P>IF virtue be the beauty of an intelligent Being, and vir|tue con&s;i&s;ts in love, then it is a plain incon&s;i&s;tence, to &s;up|po&s;e that virtue primarily con&s;i&s;ts in any love to its object for its beauty; either in a love of complacence, which is delight in a Being for his beauty, or in a love of bene|volence, that has the beauty of its object for its foundati|on. For that would be to &s;uppo&s;e, that the beauty of in|telligent Beings primarily con&s;i&s;ts in love to beauty; or, that their virtue fir&s;t of all con&s;i&s;ts in their love to virtue. Which is an incon&s;i&s;tence, and going in a circle. Be|cau&s;e it makes virtue, or beauty of mind, the foundation or fir&s;t motive of that love wherein virtue originally con|&s;i&s;ts, or wherein the very fir&s;t virtue con&s;i&s;ts; or, it &s;up|po&s;es the fir&s;t virtue to be the con&s;equence and effect of virtue. So that virtue is originally the foundation and exciting cau&s;e of the very beginning or fir&s;t Being of vir|tue, Which makes the fir&s;t virtue, both the ground, and the con&s;equence, both cau&s;e and effect of it&s;elf. Doubtle&s;s virtue primarily con&s;i&s;ts in &s;omething el&s;e be|&s;ides any effect or con&s;equence of virtue. If virtue con|&s;i&s;ts primarily in love to virtue, then virtue, the thing loved, is the love of virtue; &s;o that virtue mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the love of the love of virtue. And if it be inquired, what that virtue is, which virtue con&s;i&s;ts in the love of
<PB N="121" REF="009962_0127_0F7B3D70C825CCD8">
the love of, it mu&s;t be an&s;wered, 'tis the love of virtue. So that there mu&s;t be the love of the love of the virtue, and &s;o on <HI>in infinitum.</HI> For there is no end of go|ing back in a circle. We never come to any beginning, or foundation. For 'tis without beginning and hangs on nothing.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, if the e&s;&s;ence of virtue or beauty of mind lies in lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or a di&s;po&s;ition to love, it mu&s;t primarily con|&s;i&s;t in &s;omething <HI>different</HI> both from complacence, which is a de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight in beauty, and al&s;o from any benevolence that has the beauty of its object for its foundation. Becau&s;e 'tis ab|&s;urd, to &s;ay that virtue is primarily and fir&s;t of all the con|&s;equence of it&s;elf. For this makes virtue primarily prior to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>NOR can virtue primarily con&s;i&s;t in <HI>gratitude;</HI> or one Being's benevolence to another for his benevolence to him. Becau&s;e this implies the &s;ame incon&s;i&s;tence. For it &s;uppo|&s;es a benevolence prior to gratitude, that is the cau&s;e of gratitude. Therefore the fir&s;t benevolence, or that bene|volence which has none prior to it, can't be gratitude.</P>
<P>THEREFORE there is room left for no other conclu&s;ion than that the primary object of virtuous love is Being, &s;im|ply con&s;idered; or, that true virtue primarily con&s;i&s;ts, not in love to any particular Beings, becau&s;e of their virtue or beauty, nor in gratitude, becau&s;e they love us; but in a pro|pen&s;ity and union of heart to Being &s;imply con&s;idered; excit|ing <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> Benevolence (if I may &s;o call it) to Being in ge|neral.&mdash;I &s;ay, true virtue <HI>primarily</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in this. For I am far from a&s;&s;erting, that there is no true virtue in any other love than this ab&s;olute benevolence. But I would expre&s;s what appears to me to be the truth, on this &s;ubject, in the following particulars.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> object of a virtuous benevolence is <HI>Being,</HI> &s;im|ply con&s;idered: and if Being, <HI>&s;imply</HI> con&s;idered, be its ob|ject, then Being <HI>in general</HI> is its object; and the thing it has an ultimate propen&s;ity to, is the <HI>highe&s;t good</HI> of Being in general. And it will &s;eek the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ood of every <HI>individual</HI> Being unle&s;s it be conceived as not con&s;i&s;tent with the
<PB N="122" REF="009962_0128_0F7B3D71860820E0">
highe&s;t good of Being in general. In which ca&s;e the good of a particular Being, or &s;ome Beings, may be given up for the &s;ake of the highe&s;t good of Being in general. And particularly if there be any Being that is looked upon as &s;tatedly and irreclaimably oppo&s;ite and an enemy to Being in general, then con&s;ent and adherence to Being in general will induce the truly virtuous heart to for&s;ake that Being, and to oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>AND further, if Being, &s;imply con&s;idered, be the fir&s;t object of a truly virtuous benevolence, then that Being who has <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of Being, or has the greate&s;t &s;hare of exi&s;t|ence, other things being equal, &s;o far as &s;uch a Being is exhibited to our faculties or &s;et in our view, will have the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> &s;hare of the propen&s;ity and benevolent affection of the heart.&mdash;I &s;ay, <HI>other things being equal,</HI> e&s;pecially be|cau&s;e there is a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> object of virtuous benevolence, that I &s;hall take notice of pre&s;ently. Which is one thing that mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the ground or motive to a pure|ly virtuous benevolence. Pure benevolence in its fir&s;t ex|erci&s;e is nothing el&s;e but Being's uniting, con&s;ent, or pro|pen&s;ity to Being; appearing true and pure by its extending to Being in general, and inclining to the general highe&s;t good, and to each Being, who&s;e welfare is con&s;i&s;tent with the highe&s;t general good, in proportion to the Degree of <HI>exi&s;tence</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay,&mdash;in proportion to the degree of <HI>exi&s;tence,</HI>&mdash;becau&s;e one Being may have more <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> than another, as he may be <HI>greater</HI> than another. That which is <HI>great,</HI> has more exi&s;tence, and is further from nothing, than that which is <HI>little.</HI> One Being may have every thing po&s;itive belonging to it, or every thing which goes to it's po&s;itive exi&s;tence (in oppo&s;ition to defect) in an higher degree than another; or a greater capacity and power, greater under&s;tanding, every faculty and every po&s;itive quality in an higher degree. An <HI>Arch-angel</HI> mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have more exi&s;tence, and to be every way further removed from <HI>non entity,</HI> than a <HI>worm,</HI> or a <HI>flea.</HI></NOTE> under&s;tand, other things being equal.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> object of a virtuous propen&s;ity of heart is <HI>be|nevolent</HI> Being.&mdash;A &s;econdary ground of pure benevo|lence
<PB N="123" REF="009962_0129_0F7B3D7243E792A0">
is virtuous benevolence it&s;elf in its object. When any one under the influence of general benevolence, &s;ees another Being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the like general benevolence, this attaches his heart to him, and draws forth greater love to him, than meerly his having exi&s;tence: becau&s;e &s;o far as the Being beloved has love to Being in general, &s;o far his own Being is, as it were, enlarged; extends to, and in &s;ome &s;ort comprehends, Being in general: and therefore he that is governed by love to Being in general, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have complacence in him, and the greater degree of benevolence to him, as it were out of gratitude to him for his love to general exi&s;tence, that his own heart is ex|tended and united to, and &s;o looks on its intere&s;t as its own. 'Tis becau&s;e his heart is thus united to Being in general, that he looks on a benevolent propen&s;ity to Being in general, wherever he &s;ees it, as the beauty of the Being in whom it is; an excellency, that renders him worthy of e&s;teem, complacence, and the greater good-will.</P>
<P>BUT &s;everal things may be noted more particularly con|cerning this &s;econdary ground of a truly virtuous love.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT loving a Being on <HI>this ground</HI> nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es from pure benevolence to Being <HI>in general,</HI> and comes to the &s;ame thing. For he that has a &s;imple and pure good-will to general entity or exi&s;tence, mu&s;t love that temper in others, that agrees and con&s;pires with it&s;elf. A &s;pirit of con&s;ent to Being mu&s;t agree with con&s;ent to Being. That which truly and &s;incerely &s;eeks the good of others, mu&s;t approve of, and love that which joins with him in &s;eeking the good of others.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS which has been now mentioned as a &s;econdary ground of virtuous love, is the thing wherein true moral or &s;piritual <HI>beauty</HI> primarily con&s;i&s;ts. Yea, &s;piritual beauty con&s;i&s;ts wholly in this, and the various qualities and ex|erci&s;es of mind which proceed from it, and the external actions which proceed from the&s;e internal qualities and ex|erci&s;es. And in the&s;e things con&s;i&s;ts all true <HI>virtue,</HI> viz. in this love of Being, and the qualities and acts which ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="124" REF="009962_0130_0F7B3D730071FF98">
3. As all &s;piritual beauty lies in the&s;e virtuous princi|ples and acts, &s;o 'tis primarily <HI>on this account</HI> they are beau|tiful, <HI>viz.</HI> that they imply <HI>con&s;ent</HI> and <HI>union</HI> with Being <HI>in general.</HI> This is the primary and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential beauty of every thing that can ju&s;tly be called by the name of virtue, or is any moral excellency in the eye of one that has a perfect view of things. I &s;ay,&mdash;the <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential</HI> beauty,&mdash;becau&s;e there is a &s;econdary and inferior &s;ort of beauty; which I &s;hall take notice of afterwards.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS &s;piritual beauty, that is but a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> ground of a virtuous benevolence, is the ground, not only of be|nevolence, but <HI>complacence,</HI> and is the <HI>primary</HI> ground of the latter; that is, when the complacence is truly virtuous. Love to us in particular, and kindne&s;s received, may be a &s;econdary ground: but this is the primary objective foundation of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT mu&s;t be noted, that the <HI>degree</HI> of the <HI>aimablene&s;s</HI> or <HI>valuablene&s;s</HI> of true virtue, primarily con&s;i&s;ting in con|&s;ent and a benevolent propen&s;ity of heart to Being in gene|ral, in the eyes of one that is influenced by &s;uch a &s;pirit, is not in the <HI>&s;imple</HI> proportion of the degree of benevolent affection &s;een, but in a proportion <HI>compounded</HI> of the greatne&s;s of the benevolent Being or the degree of <HI>Being</HI> and the de|gree of <HI>benevolence.</HI> One that loves Being in general, will nece&s;&s;arily value good-will to Being in general, wherever he &s;ees it. But if he &s;ees the &s;ame benevolence in <HI>two</HI> Beings, he will value it <HI>more</HI> in two, than in one only. Be|cau&s;e it is a greater thing, more favorable to Being in ge|neral, to have two Beings to favor it, than only one of them. For there is more Being, that favors Being: both together having more Being than one alone. So, if one Being be as great as two, has as much exi&s;tence as both to|gether, and has the &s;ame degree of general benevolence, it is more favorable to being in general than if there were ge|neral benevolence in a Being that had but half that &s;hare of exi&s;tence. As a large quantity of gold, with the &s;ame degree of preciou&s;ne&s;s, i. e. with the &s;ame excellent quality of matter, is more valuable than a &s;mall quantity of the &s;ame metal.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="125" REF="009962_0131_0F7B3D7405FE6C80">
6. IT is impo&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould truly <HI>reli&s;h</HI> this beauty, con&s;i&s;ting in general benevolence, who has <HI>not</HI> that temper him&s;elf. I have ob&s;erved, that if any Being is po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uch a temper, he will unavoidably be plea&s;ed with the &s;ame temper in another. And it may in like manner be demon&s;trated, that 'tis &s;uch a &s;pirit, and nothing el&s;e, which will reli&s;h &s;uch a &s;pirit. For if a Being, de&s;titute of benevolence, &s;hould love benevolence to Being in general, it would prize and &s;eek that which it had no value for. Becau&s;e to love an inclination to the good of Being in ge|neral, would imply a loving and prizing the good of Being in general. For how &s;hould one love and value a <HI>di&s;po&s;iti|on</HI> to a thing, or <HI>a tendency to promote</HI> a thing, and for that very rea&s;on, becau&s;e it tends to promote it,&mdash;when the <HI>thing</HI> it&s;elf is what he is regardle&s;s of, and has no value for, nor de&s;ires to have promoted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing how that love, wherein true virtue con&s;i&s;ts, re&s;pects the divine Being and created Beings.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, 'tis evident, that true virtue mu&s;t chiefly con&s;i&s;t in love to God; the Being of Beings, infinitely the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Beings. This appears, whether we con&s;ider the primary or &s;econdary ground of virtuous love. It was ob&s;erved, that the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> objective ground of that love, wherein true virtue con&s;i&s;ts, is Being, &s;imply con&s;idered: and as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of this, that Being who has the mo&s;t of Being, or the greate&s;t &s;hare of univer&s;al exi&s;tence, has proportionably the greate&s;t &s;hare of virtuous benevolence, &s;o far as &s;uch a Being is exhibit|ed to the faculties of our minds, other things being equal. But God has infinitely the greate&s;t &s;hare of exi&s;tence, or is infinitely the greate&s;t Being. So that all other Being, even that of all created things what&s;oever, throughout the whole univer&s;e, is as nothing in compari&s;on of the divine Being.</P>

AND if we con&s;ider the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> ground of love, viz. beauty, or moral excellency, the &s;ame thing will appear. For as God is infinitely the greate&s;t Being, &s;o he is allowed to be infinitely the mo&s;t beautiful and excellent: and all the beauty to be found throughout the whole creation, is but the reflexion of the diffu&s;ed beams of that Being who hath an infinite fulne&s;s of brightne&s;s and glory. God's beauty is infinitely more valuable, than that of all other Beings up|on both tho&s;e accounts mentioned, viz. the <HI>degree</HI> of his virtue, and the greatne&s;s of the Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this vir|tue. And God has &s;ufficiently exhibited him&s;elf, in his Being, his infinite greatne&s;s and excellency: and has given us faculties, whereby we are capable of plainly di&s;covering immen&s;e &s;uperiority to all other Beings, in the&s;e re&s;pects. Therefore he that has true virtue, con&s;i&s;ting in benevo|lence to Being in general, and in that complacence in vir|tue, or moral beauty, and benevolence to virtuous Being, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a &s;upreme love to God, both of benevolence and complacence. And all true vertue mu&s;t radically and e&s;&s;entially, and as it were &s;ummarily, con&s;i&s;t in this. Becau&s;e God is not only infinitely greater and more excellent than all other Being, but he is the head of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem of exi&s;tence; the foundation and fountain of all Being and all beauty; from whom all is perfectly derived, and on whom all is mo&s;t ab&s;olutely and perfectly dependant; <HI>of whom,</HI> and <HI>through whom, &amp; to whom</HI> is all Being and all perfection; and who&s;e Being and beauty is as it were the &s;um and comprehen&s;ion of all ex|i&s;tence and excellence: much more than the &s;un is the fountain and &s;ummary comprehen&s;ion of all the light and brightne&s;s of the day.</P>

<P>THERE &s;eems to be an incon&s;i&s;tence in &s;ome writers on morality, in this re&s;pect, that they don't wholly exclude a regard to the <HI>Deity</HI> out of there &s;chemes of morality, but yet mention it &s;o &s;lightly, that they leave me room and rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect they e&s;teem it a le&s;s important and a &s;ub|ordinate part of true morality; and in&s;i&s;t on benevolence to the <HI>created &s;y&s;tem</HI> in &s;uch a manner, as would naturally lead one to &s;uppo&s;e, they look upon that as by far the mo&s;t important and e&s;&s;ential thing in their &s;cheme.

For the chief and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential good that is in virtue, is its favouring Being in general. Now certainly, if private affection to a limited &s;y&s;tem had in it&s;elf the e&s;&s;ential nature of virtue, it would be impo&s;&s;ible, that it &s;hould in any circum&s;tance what&s;oe|ver have a tendency and inclination directly <HI>contrary</HI> to that wherein the e&s;&s;ence of virtue chiefly con&s;i&s;ts.</P>

Even as the &s;etting up another prince as &s;upreme in any kingdom, di&s;tinct from the lawful &s;overeign, naturally tends to enmity again&s;t the lawful &s;overeign. Wherever it is &s;ufficiently publi&s;h|ed, that the &s;upreme, infinite, and all-comprehending Be|ing requires a &s;upreme regard to him&s;elf; and in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that our re&s;pect to him &s;hould univer&s;ally rule in our hearts, and every other affection be &s;ubordinate to it, and this under the pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure (as we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it is in the world of intelligent creatures, if God maintains a moral kingdom in the world) then a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our having cho&s;en and &s;et up another prince to rule over us, and &s;ubjected our hearts to him, and continuing in &s;uch an act, mu&s;t unavoidably excite enmity, and fix us in a &s;tated op|po&s;ition, to the &s;upreme Being. This demon&s;trates, that affection to a private &s;ociety of &s;y&s;tem, independent on ge|neral benevolence, cannot be of the nature of true virtue.

3. NOT only would affection to a private &s;y&s;tem, un&s;ub|ordinate to regard to Being in general, have a tendency to oppo&s;ition to the &s;upreme object of virtuous affection, as its effect and con&s;equence, but would become <HI>it&s;elf</HI> an oppo&s;i|tion to that object. Con&s;idered by it&s;elf in its nature, de|tach'd from its effects, it is an in&s;tance of great oppo&s;ition to the rightful &s;upreme object of our re&s;pect. For it exalts its private object above the other great and infinite object; and &s;ets that up as &s;upreme, in oppo&s;ition to this. It puts down Being in general, which is infinitely &s;uperior in it&s;elf and infinitely more important, in an inferior place; yea, &s;ubjects the &s;upreme general object to this private infinite|ly inferior object: which is to treat it with great contempt and truly to act in oppo&s;ition to it, and to act in oppo&s;ition to the true order of things, and in oppo&s;ition to that which is infinitely the &s;upreme intere&s;t; making this &s;upreme and infinitely important intere&s;t, as far as in us lies, to be &s;ub|ject to, and dependent on, an intere&s;t infinitely inferior. This is to act again&s;t it, and to act the part of an enemy to it.

<P>FROM the&s;e things, I think, it is manife&s;t, that no affec|tion limited to any private &s;y&s;tem, not dependent on, nor &s;ubordinate to Being in general, can be of the nature of true virtue; and this, whatever the private &s;y&s;tem be, let it be more or le&s;s exten&s;ive, con&s;i&s;ting of a greater or &s;mall|er number of individuals, &s;o long as it contains an infinite|ly little part of univer&s;al exi&s;tence, and &s;o bears no propor|tion to the great all-comprehending &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;And con&s;e|quently, that no affection what&s;oever to any creature, or any &s;y&s;tem of created beings, which is not dependent on, nor &s;ubordinate to a propen&s;ity or union of the heart to God, the &s;upreme and infinite Being, can be of the nature of true virtue.</P>
<P>FROM hence al&s;o it is evident, that the <HI>divine virtue,</HI> or the virtue of the divine mind, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t primarily in <HI>love to him&s;elf,</HI> or in the mutual love and friend&s;hip which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts eternally and nece&s;&s;arily between the &s;everal per&s;ons

<P>WITH re&s;pect to the manner in which a virtuous love in <HI>created</HI> Beings,<HI> one to another,</HI> is dependent on, and derived from love to <HI>God,</HI> this will appear by a proper con&s;ideration of what has been &s;aid; that it is &s;ufficient to render love to any created Being virtuous, if it ari&s;e from the temper of mind wherein con&s;i&s;ts a di&s;po&s;ition to love God &s;upremely. Becau&s;e it appears from what has been already ob&s;erved, all that love to <HI>particular Beings,</HI> which is the fruit of a be|nevolent propen&s;ity of heart to <HI>Being in general,</HI> is virtuous love. But, as has been remark'd, a benevolent propen&s;ity of heart to Being in general, and a temper or di&s;po&s;ition to love God &s;upremely, are in effect the &s;ame thing. There|fore, if love to a created Being comes from that temper or propen&s;ity of the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, it is virtuous.&mdash;However, every particular exerci&s;e of love to a creature may not <HI>&s;en&s;ibly</HI> ari&s;e from any exerci&s;e of love to God, or an explicit con&s;idera|tion of any &s;imilitude, conformity, union or relation to God, in the creature beloved.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t proper <HI>evidence</HI> of love to a created Being, its ari&s;ing from that temper of mind wherein con&s;i&s;ts a &s;upreme propen&s;ity of heart to God, &s;eems to be the agreablene&s;s of the kind and degree of our love to <HI>God's end</HI> in our creation and in the creation of all things, and the coincidence of the exerci&s;es of our love, in their manner, order, and mea|&s;ure, with the <HI>manner</HI> in which <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf exerci&s;es love to the creature in the creation and government of the world, and the way in which God as the fir&s;t cau&s;e and &s;u|preme

di&s;po&s;er of all things, has re&s;pect to the creature's happine&s;s, in &s;ubordination to him&s;elf as his own &s;upreme end.

But, as has been &s;hewn, the la&s;t end for which God has made moral agents, mu&s;t be the la&s;t end for which God has made all things: it be|ing evident, that the moral world is the end of the re&s;t of the world; the inanimate and unintelligent world being made for the rational and moral world, as much as a hou&s;e is prepared for the inhabitants.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e things it appears, that a truly virtuous mind, being as it were under the &s;overeign dominion of <HI>love to God,</HI> does above all things &s;eek the <HI>glory of God,</HI> and makes <HI>this</HI> his &s;upreme, governing, and ultimate end: con&s;i&s;ting in the expre&s;&s;ion of God's perfections in their proper effects, and in the manife&s;tation of God's glory to created under|&s;tandings, and the communications of the infinite fulne&s;s of God to the creature; in the creature's highe&s;t e&s;teem of God, love to God, and joy in God, and in the proper ex|erci&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e.&mdash;And &s;o far as a virtu|ous mind exerci&s;es true virtue in benevolence to created Beings, it chiefly &s;eeks the good of the creature, con&s;i&s;ting in its knowledge or view of God's glory and beauty, its u|nion with God, and conformity to him, love to him, and joy in him.&mdash;And that temper or di&s;po&s;ition of heart, that con&s;ent, union, or propen&s;ity of mind to Being in ge|neral, which appears chiefly in &s;uch exerci&s;es, is virtue, truly &s;o called; or in other words, true grace and real ho|line&s;s.

Yet there are o|ther qualities, other &s;en&s;ations, propen&s;ities and affections of mind, and principles o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> action, that often obtain the epithet of <HI>virtuous,</HI> and by many are &s;uppo&s;ed to have the nature of true virtue: which are intirely of a di&s;tinct na|ture from this, and have nothing of that kind; and there|fore are erroneou&s;ly confounded with real virtue:&mdash;

as may particularly and fully appear from things which will be ob&s;erved in this and the following chapters.</P>
<P>THAT con&s;ent, agreement, or union of Being to Being, which has been &s;poken of, viz. the union or propen&s;ity of <HI>minds</HI> to mental or &s;piritual exi&s;tence, may be called the highe&s;t, and fir&s;t, or primary beauty, that is to be found among things that exi&s;t: being the proper and pe|culiar beauty of &s;piritual and moral Beings, which are the highe&s;t and fir&s;t part of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem, for who&s;e &s;ake all the re&s;t has exi&s;tence. Yet there is ano|ther, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erior, &s;econdary beauty, which is &s;ome image of this, and which is not peculiar to &s;piritual Beings, but is found even in inanimate things: which con&s;i&s;ts in a mu|tual con&s;ent and agreement of different things, in form, manner, quantity, and vi&s;ible end or de&s;ign; called by the various names of regularity, order, uniformity, &s;ym|metry, proportion, harmony, &amp;c. Such is the mutual agreement of the various &s;ides of a &s;quare, or equilateral triangle, or of a regular polygon. Such is, as it were, the mutual con&s;ent of the different parts of the periphery of a circle, or &s;urface of a &s;phere, and of the corre&s;pond|ing parts of an ellip&s;is. Such is the agreement of the colours, figures, dimen&s;ions, and di&s;tances of the different &s;pots on a che&s;s board. Such is the beauty of the figures on a piece of chints, or brocade. Such is the beautiful proportion of the various parts of an human body, or coun|tenance. And &s;uch is the &s;weet mutual con&s;ent and agree|ment of the various notes of a melodious tune. This is the &s;ame that Mr. HUTCHESON, in his treati&s;e on beauty, expre&s;&s;es by uniformity in the mid&s;t of variety. Which is no other than the con&s;ent or agreement of different things, in form, quantity.&amp;c He ob&s;erves, that the greater the variety is, in equal uniformity, the greater the beauty. Which is no more than to &s;ay, the more there are of different mutually agreeing things, the greater is the beauty. And the rea|&s;on of that is, becau&s;e 'tis more con&s;iderable to have many things con&s;ent one with another, than a few only.</P>
<P>THE beauty which con&s;i&s;ts in the vi&s;ible fitne&s;s of a thing to its u&s;e, and unity of de&s;ign, is not a di&s;tinct &s;ort of beauty from this. For it's to be ob&s;erved, that one thing
<PB N="136" REF="009962_0142_0F7B3D7D41104720">
which contributes to the beauty of the agreement &amp; pro|portion of various things, is their relation one to another; which connects them, and introduces them together into view and con&s;ideration, and whereby one &s;ugge&s;ts the other to the mind, and the mind is led to compare them and &s;o to expect and de&s;ire agreement. Thus the uniformity of two or more pillars, as they may happen to be found in different places, is not an equal degree of beauty, as that uniformity in &s;o many pillars in the corre&s;ponding parts of the &s;ame building. So means and an intended effect are related one to another. The an&s;werablene&s;s of a thing to its u&s;e is only the proportion, fitne&s;s, and agreeing of a cau&s;e or means to a vi&s;ibly de&s;igned effect, and &s;o an ef|fect &s;ugge&s;ted to the mind by the idea of the means. This kind of beauty is not intirely different from that beauty which there is in fitting a morti&s;e to its tenon. Only when the beauty con&s;i&s;ts in unity of de&s;ign, or the adapted|ne&s;s of a variety of things to promote one intended effect, in which all con&s;pire, as the various parts of an inge|nious complicated machine, there is a double beauty, as there is a twofold agreement and conformity. Fir&s;t, there is the agreement of the various parts to the de&s;igned end. Secondly, thro' this, viz. the de&s;igned end or effect, all the various particulars agree one with another as the general medium of their union whereby they being u|nited in this third, they thereby are all united one to another.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on, or at lea&s;t one rea&s;on why God has made this kind of mutual con&s;ent and agreement of things beautiful and grateful to tho&s;e intelligent Beings that per|ceive it, probably is, that there is in it &s;ome image of the true, &s;piritual original beauty, which has been &s;poken of: con&s;i&s;ting in Being's con&s;ent to Being, or the union of minds or &s;piritual Beings in a mutual propen&s;ity and affection of heart. The other is an image of this, be|cau&s;e by that uniformity diver&s;e things become as it were one, as it is in this cordial union. And it plea&s;es God to ob&s;erve analogy in his works, as is manife&s;t in fact in innumerable in&s;tances; and e&s;pecially to e&s;tabli&s;h inferior things in an analogy to &s;uperior. Thus, in how many in&s;tances has he formed brutes in analogy to
<PB N="137" REF="009962_0143_0F7B3D7DA9140590">
the nature of mankind? and plants, in analogy to animals, with re&s;pect to the manner of their generation, nutrition, &amp;c. And &s;o he has con&s;tituted the external world in an analogy to things in the &s;piritual world, in numberle&s;s in|&s;tances; as might be &s;hewn, if it were nece&s;&s;ary, and here were proper place and room for it.&mdash;Why &s;uch analogy in God's works plea&s;es him, 'tis not needful now to inquire. It is &s;ufficient that he makes an agreement or con&s;ent of different things, in their form, manner, mea&s;ure, &amp;c. to appear beautiful, becau&s;e here is &s;ome image of an higher kind of agreement and con&s;ent of &s;piritual Beings. It has plea&s;ed him to e&s;tabli&s;h a law of nature, by virtue of which the uniformity and mutual corre&s;pondence of a beautiful plant, and the re&s;pect which the various parts of a regular building &s;eem to have one to another, and their agreement and union, &amp; he con&s;ent or concord of the various notes of a melodious tune, &s;hould appear beautiful; becau&s;e there|in is &s;ome image of the con&s;ent of mind, of the different members of a &s;ociety or &s;y&s;tem of intelligent Beings, &s;weet|ly united in a benevolent agreement of heart.&mdash;And here by the way, I would further ob&s;erve, probably &punc;tis with regard to this image or re&s;emblance, which &s;econdary beau|ty has of true &s;piritual beauty, that God has &s;o con&s;tituted nature, that the pre&s;enting of this inferior beauty, e&s;peci|ally in tho&s;e kinds of it which have the greate&s;t re&s;em|blance of the primary beauty, as the harmony of &s;ounds, and the beauties of nature, have a tendency to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are under the influence of a truly virtuous temper, to di&s;po&s;e them to the exerci&s;es of divine love, and enliven in them a &s;en&s;e of &s;piritual beauty.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid we may &s;ee, that there are two &s;orts of agreement or con&s;ent of one thing to another. (1.) There is a <HI>cordial</HI> agreement; that con&s;i&s;ts in concord and union of mind and heart: which, if not attended (viewing things in general) with more di&s;cord than concord, is true virtue, and the original or primary beauty, which is the only true <HI>moral</HI> beauty.&mdash;(2.) There is a <HI>natural</HI> union or agreement: which, tho' &s;ome image of the other, is in|tirely a di&s;tinct thing; the will, di&s;po&s;ition, or affection of the heart having no concern in it, but con&s;i&s;ting only in uniformity and con&s;ent of nature, form, quantity, &amp;c&punc; (as
<PB N="138" REF="009962_0144_0F7B3D7E43ED91C8">
before de&s;cribed) wherein lies an inferior &s;econdary &s;ort of beauty, which may, in di&s;tinction from the other, be call'd <HI>natural</HI> beauty.&mdash;This may be &s;ufficient to let the reader know how I &s;hall hereafter u&s;e the phra&s;es of cordial, and natural agreement; and moral, &s;piritual, divine, and pri|mary original beauty, and &s;econdary, or natural beauty.</P>
<P>CONCERNING this latter, inferior kind of beauty, the following things may be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>cau&s;e</HI> why &s;econdary beauty is grateful to Men, is only a <HI>law of nature,</HI> which God has fixed, or an <HI>in&s;tinct</HI> he has given to mankind; and not their perception of the &s;ame thing which <HI>God</HI> is plea&s;ed to have regard to, as the ground or rule by which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch a law of nature.&mdash;This appears in two things.</P>
<P>(1.) THAT which God has re&s;pect to, as the rule or ground of this law of nature he has given us, whereby things having a &s;econdary beauty are made grateful to men, is their mutual agreement and proportion, in mea&s;ure, form &amp;c. But in many in&s;tances per&s;ons that are gratify'd, and have their minds affected, in pre&s;enting this beauty, don't reflect on that particular agreement and proportion, which according to the law of nature is the ground and rule of beauty in the ca&s;e, yea, are ignorant of it. Thus, a man may be plea&s;ed with the harmony of the notes in a tune, and yet know nothing of that proportion or adju&s;tment of the notes, which by the law of nature is the ground of the melody. He knows not, that the vibrations in one note regularly co-incide with the vibrations in another; that the vibrations of a note co-incide in time with two vibra|tions of its octave; and that two vibrations of a note co-incide with three of its fifth, &amp;c.&mdash;Yea, he may not know, that there are vibrations of the air in the ca&s;e, or any cor|re&s;ponding motions in the organs of hearing, in the audi|tory nerve, or animal &s;pirits.&mdash;So, a man may be affected and plea&s;ed with a beautiful proportion of the features in a face, and yet not know what that proportion is, or what mea&s;ures, quantities, and di&s;tances it con&s;i&s;ts in.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="009962_0145_0F7B3D7EF8E9F240">
IN this a &s;en&s;ation of &s;econdary beauty differs from a &s;en&s;ation of primary and &s;piritual beauty, con&s;i&s;ting in a &s;piritual union and agreement. What makes the latter grateful, is perceiving the union it&s;elf. 'Tis the immediate view of that wherein the beauty fundamentally lies, that is plea&s;ing to the virtuous mind.</P>
<P>(2.) AS was ob&s;erv'd before, God in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch a law that mutual natural agreement of different things, in form, quantity, &amp;c. &s;hould appear beautiful or grateful to men, &s;eems to have had regard to the image and re&s;emblance there is in &s;uch a natural agreement, of that &s;piritual cordial agreement, wherein original beauty con&s;i&s;ts, as one rea&s;on why he e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch a law. But it is not any reflection upon, or preception of, &s;uch a re|&s;emblance of this to &s;piritual beauty, that is the rea&s;on why &s;uch a form or &s;tate of objects appear beautiful to men: but their &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure, on a view of this &s;e|condary beauty is immediately owing to the law God has e&s;tabli&s;hed, or the in&s;tinct he has given.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER thing ob&s;ervable concerning this kind of beauty, is, that it affects the mind more (other things be|ing equal) when taken notice of in objects which are of con&s;iderable importance, than in little trivial matters. Thus, the &s;ymmetry of the parts of a human body, or countenance, affects the mind more than the beauty of a flower. So, the beauty of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, more than as great and as manifold an order and uniformity in a tree. And the proportions of the parts of a church, or a palace, more than the &s;ame proportions in &s;ome little &s;light com|po&s;itions, made to plea&s;e children.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT may be ob&s;erved (which was hinted before) that not only uniformity and proportion, &amp;c. of different things is requi&s;ite in order to this inferior beauty, but &s;ome rela|tion or connection of the things thus agreeing one with a|nother. As, the uniformity or likene&s;s of a number of pil|lars, &s;cattered hither and thither, does not con&s;titute beau|ty, or at lea&s;t by no means in an equal degree as unifor|mity in pillars connected in the &s;ame building, in parts that have relation one to another So if we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">
<PB N="140" REF="009962_0146_0F7B3D8171AC4348">
unlike, and very di&s;proportion'd, in di&s;tant places, which have no relation to each other, this excites no &s;uch idea of deformity, as di&s;agreement and inequality or di&s;proportion in things related and connected: and the nearer the rela|tion and the &s;tricter the connection, &s;o much the greater and more di&s;gu&s;tful is the deformity, con&s;i&s;ting in their di&s;|agreement.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS &s;econdary kind of beauty, con&s;i&s;ting in unifor|mity and proportion, not only takes place in material and external things, but al&s;o in things immaterial; and is, in very many things, plain and &s;en&s;ible in the latter, as well as the former: and when it is &s;o, there is no rea&s;on why it &s;hould not be grateful to them that behold it, in the&s;e, as well as the other, by virtue of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e or the &s;ame determination of mind to be gratify'd with uniformity and proportion. If uniformity and proportion be the things that affect, and appear agreable to, this &s;en&s;e of beauty, then why &s;hould not uniformity and proportion affect the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in immaterial things, as well as material, if there be equal capacity of di&s;cerning it in both? and in|deed <HI>more</HI> in &s;piritual things (<HI>caeteris paribus</HI>) as the&s;e are more important than things meerly external and material?</P>
<P>THIS is not only rea&s;onable to be &s;uppo&s;ed, but is evi|dent in fact, in numberle&s;s in&s;tances. There is a beauty of order in &s;ociety, be&s;ides what con&s;i&s;ts in benevolence, or can be refer'd to it, which is of the &s;econdary kind. As, when the different members of &s;ociety have all their ap|pointed office, place and &s;tation, according to their &s;everal capacities and talents, and every one keeps his place, and continues in his proper bu&s;ine&s;s. In this there is a beauty, not of a different kind from the regularity of a beautiful building, or piece of &s;kilful architecture, where the &s;trong pillars are &s;et in their proper place, the pila&s;ters in a place fit for them, the &s;quare pieces of marble in the pavement in a place &s;uitable for them, the pannels in the walls and partitions in their proper places, the corni&s;hes in places proper for them, &amp;c. As the agreement of a variety in one common de&s;ign, of the parts of a building, or com|plicated machine, is one in&s;tance of that regularity, which belongs to the &s;econdary kind of beauty, &s;o there is the
<PB N="141" REF="009962_0147_0F7B3D821A61B920">
&s;ame kind of beauty in immaterial things, in what is called <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in the united tendency of thoughts, ideas, and particular volitions, to one general purpo&s;e: which is a di&s;tinct thing from the goodne&s;s of that general purpo&s;e, as being u&s;eful and benevolent.</P>
<P>So there is a beauty in the virtue called <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in the agreement of different things, that have relation to one another, in nature, manner, and mea&s;ure: and therefore is the very &s;ame &s;ort of beauty with that uniformity and proportion, which is ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e external and material things that are e&s;teemed beautiful. There is a natural agreement and adaptedne&s;s of things that have relation one to another, and an harmonious cor|re&s;ponding of one thing to another: that he which from his will <HI>does</HI> evil to others, &s;hould <HI>receive</HI> evil from the will of others, or from the will of him or them who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to take care of the injured, and to act in their behalf: and that he &s;hould &s;uffer evil in <HI>proportion</HI> to the evil of his doings. Things are in natural regularity and mutual a|greement, not in a metaphorical but literal &s;en&s;e, when he who&s;e heart oppo&s;es the general &s;y&s;tem, &s;hould have the hearts of that &s;y&s;tem, or the heart of the head and ruler of the &s;y&s;tem, again&s;t him: and that in con&s;equence, he &s;hould receive evil, in proportion to the evil tendency of the op|po&s;ition of his heart.&mdash;So, there is a like agreement in nature and mea&s;ure, when he that loves, has the proper returns of love: when he that from his heart promotes the good of another, has his good promoted by the other; as there is a kind of ju&s;tice in a becoming gratitude.</P>
<P>INDEED mo&s;t of the duties incumbent on us, if well con|&s;idered, will be found to partake of the nature of ju&s;tice. There is &s;ome natural agreement of one thing to another; &s;ome adaptedne&s;s of the agent to the object; &s;ome an&s;wer|ablene&s;s of the act to the occa&s;ion; &s;ome equality and pro|portion in things of a &s;imilar nature, and of a direct relati|on one to another. So it is in relative duties; duties of children to parents, and of parents to children; duties of hu&s;bands and wives; duties of rulers and &s;ubjects; duties of friend&s;hip and good neighbourhood: and all duties that we owe to God, our creator, pre&s;erver, and benefactor; and
<PB N="142" REF="009962_0148_0F7B3D82BB4AE4E0">
all duties what&s;oever, con&s;idered as required by God, and as branches of our duty to him, and al&s;o con&s;idered as what are to be performed with a regard to Chri&s;t, as acts of obe|dience to his precepts, and as te&s;timonies of re&s;pect to him, and of our regard to what he has done for us, the virtues and temper of mind he has exerci&s;ed towards us, and the benefits we have or hope for therefrom.</P>
<P>IT is this &s;econdary kind of beauty, which belongs to the virtues and duties required of us, that Mr. <HI>Wolla&s;ton</HI> &s;eems to have had in his eye, when he re&s;olved all virtue into an agreement of inclinations, volitions and actions with <HI>truth.</HI> He evidently has re&s;pect to the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> there is in the virtues and duties that are proper to be in one Being to|wards another; which con&s;i&s;ts in one Being's expre&s;&s;ing &s;uch affections and u&s;ing &s;uch a conduct towards another, as hath a natural ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erment and proportion to what is in them, and what we receive from them: which is as much a natural conformity of affection and action with its ground, object and occa&s;ion, as that which is between a true pro|po&s;ition and the thing &s;poken of in it.</P>
<P>BUT there is another and higher beauty in true virtue, and in all truly virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es, than what con&s;i&s;ts in any uniformity or &s;imilarity of various things; viz. the <HI>union of heart</HI> to <HI>Being in general,</HI> or to GOD the Being of Beings, which appears in tho&s;e virtues; and which tho&s;e virtues, when true, are the various expre&s;&s;ions or effects of. Benevolence to Being in general, or to Being &s;imply con&s;idered, is intirely a di&s;tinct thing from unifor|mity in the mid&s;t of variety, and is a &s;uperior kind of beauty.</P>
<P>'TIS true, that benevolence to Being in general, when a per&s;on hath it, will naturally incline him to ju&s;tice, or pro|portion in the exerci&s;es of it. He that loves Being, &s;imply con&s;idered, will naturally (as was ob&s;erved before) other things being equal, love particular Beings, in a proportion compounded of the degree of Being, &amp; the degree of virtue or benevolence to Being, which they have. And that is to love Beings in proportion to their dignity. For the digni|ty of any Being con&s;i&s;ts in tho&s;e two things. Re&s;pect to
<PB N="143" REF="009962_0149_0F7B3D8388DF4168">
Being, in this proportion, is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t general kind of ju&s;tice; which will produce all the &s;ubordinate kinds. So that, after benevolence to Being in general exi&s;ts, the proportion which is ob&s;erved in objects, may be the cau&s;e of the proportion of benevolence to tho&s;e objects: but no proportion is the cau&s;e or ground of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a thing as benevolence to Being. The tendency of objects to excite that degree of benevolence, which is proportiona|ble to the degree of Being, &amp;c. Is the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of the ex|i&s;tence of benevolence; and not the ground of it. Even as a tendency of bodies, one to another, by mutual attracti|on, in proportion to the quantity of matter, is the con&s;e|quence of the Being of &s;uch a thing as mutual attraction; and not attraction the effect of proportion.</P>
<P>BY this it appears, that <HI>ju&s;t</HI> affections and acts have a <HI>beauty</HI> in them, di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, the uniformi|ty and equality there is in them: for which, he that has a truly virtuous temper, reli&s;hes and delights in them. And that is the expre&s;&s;ion and manife&s;tation there is in them of benevolence to Being in general.&mdash;And be&s;ides this, there is the agreement of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to the will and command of God: and al&s;o &s;omething in the tendency and con&s;e|quences of ju&s;tice, that is agreable to general benevolence, viz. as in many re&s;pects it tends to the glory of God, and the general good. Which tendency al&s;o makes it beauti|ful to a truly virtuous mind. So that the tendency of ge|neral benevolence to produce ju&s;tice, al&s;o the tendency of ju&s;tice to produce effects agreable to general benevolence, both render ju&s;tice plea&s;ing to a virtuous mind. And it is on the&s;e accounts <HI>chiefly,</HI> that ju&s;tice is grateful to a virtuous ta&s;te, or a truly benevolent heart. But, tho' it be true, there is that in the uniformity and proportion there is in ju&s;tice, which is grateful to a benevolent heart, as this uniformity and proportion tends to the general good; yet that is no argument, that there is no other beauty in it but its agreeing with benevolence. For &s;o the external regu|larity and order of the natural world gratifies benevolence, as it is profitable, and tends to the general good; but that is no argument, that there is no other &s;ort of beauty in ex|ternal uniformity and proportion, but only its &s;uiting bene|volence by tending to the general good.</P>

5. FROM all that has been ob&s;erved concerning this &s;e|condary kind of beauty, it appears that that di&s;po&s;ition or &s;en&s;e of the mind, which con&s;i&s;ts in determination of mind to approve and be plea&s;ed with this beauty, con&s;idered &s;im|ply and by it&s;elf, has nothing of the nature of true virtue, and is intirely a different thing from a truly virtuous ta&s;te. For it has been &s;hewn, that this kind of beauty is intirely diver&s;e from the beauty of true virtue, whether it takes place in material or immaterial things. And therefore it will follow, that a ta&s;te of this kind of beauty is intirely a diffe|rent thing from a ta&s;te of true virtue. Who will affirm, that a di&s;po&s;ition to approve of the harmony of good mu|&s;ick, or the beauty of a &s;quare, or equilateral triangle, is the &s;ame with true holine&s;s, or a truly virtuous di&s;po&s;ition of mind! 'Tis a reli&s;h of uniformity and proportion, that determines the mind to approve the&s;e things. And if this be all, there is no need of any thing higher, or of any thing in any re&s;pect diver&s;e, to determine the mind to approve and be plea&s;ed with equal uniformity and proportion among &s;piritual things which are equally di&s;cerned. 'Tis virtuous to love true virtue, as that denotes an agreement of the heart with virtue. But it argues no virtue, for the heart to be plea&s;ed with that which is intirely di&s;tinct from it.</P>
<P>THO' it be true, there is &s;ome analogy in it to &s;piritual and virtuous beauty; as much as material things can have analogy to things &s;piritual (of which they can have no more than a &s;hadow) yet, as has been ob&s;erved, men do not ap|prove it becau&s;e of any &s;uch analogy perceived.</P>
<P>AND not only rea&s;on, but experience plainly &s;hews, that men's approbation of this &s;ort of beauty, does not &s;pring from any virtuous temper, and has no connexion with vir|tue. For, otherwi&s;e, men's delight in the beauty of &s;quares, and cubes, and regular polygons in the regularity of build|ings, and the beautiful figures in a piece of embroidery, would encrea&s;e in proportion to men's virtue; and would be rai&s;ed to a great height in &s;ome eminently virtuous or holy men; but would be almo&s;t wholly lo&s;t in &s;ome others that are very vicious and lewd.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of &s;elf-love, and its various influence, to cau&s;e love to others, or the contrary.</HEAD>
<P>MANY a&s;&s;ert, that all love ari&s;es from &s;elf-love. In order to determine this point, it &s;hould be clearly de|termined what is meant by &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>SELF-LOVE, I think, is generally defined&mdash;a man's love of his own happine&s;s. Which is &s;hort, and may be thought very plain: but indeed is an ambiguous definition, as the pronoun, <HI>his own,</HI> is equivocal, and liable to be taken in two very different &s;en&s;es. For a man's <HI>own happine&s;s</HI> may either be taken univer&s;ally, for all the happine&s;s or plea&s;ure which the mind is in any regard the &s;ubject of, or whate|ver is grateful and plea&s;ing to men; or it may be taken for the plea&s;ure a man takes in his own proper, private, and &s;e|parate good. And &s;o, <HI>&s;elf-love</HI> may be taken two ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. SELF-LOVE may be taken for the &s;ame as his loving what&s;oever is grateful or plea&s;ing to him. Which comes only to this, that &s;elf-love is a man's liking, and being &s;uited and plea&s;ed in that which he likes, and which plea&s;es him; or, that 'tis a man's loving what he loves. For whatever a man loves, that thing is grateful and plea&s;ing to him, whe|ther that be his own peculiar happine&s;s, or the happine&s;s of others. And if this be all that they mean by &s;elf-love, no wonder they &s;uppo&s;e that all love may be re&s;olved into &s;elf-love. For it is undoubtedly true, that whatever a man loves, his love may be re&s;olved into his loving what he loves,&mdash;if that be proper &s;peaking&mdash;If by &s;elf-love is meant nothing el&s;e but a man's loving what is grateful or plea&s;ing to him, and being aver&s;e to what is di&s;agreable,
<PB N="146" REF="009962_0152_0F7B3D86445C7098">
this is calling <HI>that</HI> &s;elf-love, which is only a general capa|city of loving, or hating; or a capacity of being either plea&s;ed or di&s;plea&s;ed: which is the &s;ame thing as a man's having a faculty of will. For if nothing could be either plea&s;ing or di&s;plea&s;ing, agreable or di&s;agreable to a man, then he could incline to nothing, and will nothing. But if he is capable of having inclination, will and choice, then what he inclines to, and chu&s;es, is grateful to him; what|ever that he, whether it be his own private good, the good of his neighbours, or the glory of God. And &s;o far as it is grateful or plea&s;ing to him, &s;o far it is a part of his plea|&s;ure, good or happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT if this be what is meant by &s;elf-love, there is an impropriety and ab&s;urdity even in the putting of the que&s;|tion, Whether all our love, or our love to each particular object of our love, don't ari&s;e from &s;elf-love? For that would be the &s;ame as to enquire, Whether the rea&s;on why our love is fix'd on &s;uch and &s;uch particu|lar objects, is not, that we have a capacity of loving &s;ome things? This may be a general rea&s;on why men love or hate any thing at all; and therein differ from &s;tones and trees, which love nothing, and hate nothing. But it can never be a rea&s;on why men's love is placed on &s;uch and &s;uch objects. That a man, in general, loves and is plea&s;ed with happine&s;s, or (which is the &s;ame thing) has a capaci|ty of enjoying happine&s;s, cannot be the rea&s;on why &s;uch and &s;uch things become his happine&s;s: as for in&s;tance, why the good of his neighbour, or the happine&s;s and glory of God, is grateful and plea&s;ing to him, and &s;o becomes a part of his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>OR if what they mean, who &s;ay that all love comes from &s;elf-love, be not, that our loving &s;uch and &s;uch particular per&s;ons and things, ari&s;es from our love to happine&s;s in ge|neral, but from a love to love our own happine&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e objects; &s;o, the rea&s;on why we love bene|volence to our friends, or neighbours, is, becau&s;e we love our happine&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting in their happine&s;s, which we take plea&s;ure in:&mdash;&s;till the notion is ab&s;urd. For here the effect it made the cau&s;e of that, of which it is the effect: our happine&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting in the happine&s;s of the per&s;on be|loved,
<PB N="147" REF="009962_0153_0F7B3D86AA1302E8">
loved, is made the cau&s;e of our love to that per&s;on. Where|as, the truth plainly is, that our love to the per&s;on is the cau&s;e of our delighting, or being happy in his happine&s;s. How comes our happine&s;s to con&s;i&s;t in the happine&s;s of &s;uch as we love, but by our hearts being fir&s;t united to them in affection, &s;o that we as it were, look on them as our &s;elves, and &s;o on their happine&s;s as our own?</P>
<P>MEN who have benevolence to others, have plea&s;ure when they &s;ee others happine&s;s, becau&s;e &s;eeing their hap|pine&s;s gratifies &s;ome inclination that was in their hearts be|fore. They before inclined to their happine&s;s; which was by benevolence or good-will; and therefore when they &s;ee their happine&s;s, their inclination is &s;uited, and they are plea&s;ed. But the Being of inclinations and appetites is pri|or to any plea&s;ure in gratifying the&s;e appetites.</P>
<P N="2">2. SELF-LOVE, as the phra&s;e is u&s;ed in common &s;peech, mo&s;t commonly &s;ignifies a man's regard to his confined <HI>private &s;elf,</HI> or love to him&s;elf with re&s;pect to his <HI>private intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>BY <HI>private</HI> intere&s;t I mean that which mo&s;t immediately con&s;i&s;ts in tho&s;e plea&s;ures, or pains, that are <HI>per&s;onal.</HI> For there is a comfort, and a grief, that &s;ome have in others plea&s;ures, or pains; which are in others originally, but are de|rived to them, or in &s;ome mea&s;ure become their's, by vir|tue of a benevolent union of heart with others. And there are other plea&s;ures and pains that are originally our own, and not what we have by &s;uch a participation with others. Which con&s;i&s;t in perceptions agreeable, or contrary, to cer|tain per&s;onal inclinations implanted in our nature; &s;uch as the &s;en&s;itive appetites and aver&s;ions. Such al&s;o is the di&s;|po&s;ition or the determination of the mind to be plea&s;ed with external beauty, and with all inferior &s;econdary beau|ty, con&s;i&s;ting in uniformity, porportion, &amp;c. whether in things external or internal, and to di&s;like the contrary de|formity. Such al&s;o is the natural di&s;po&s;ition in men to be plea&s;ed in a perception of their being the objects of the honor and love of others, and di&s;plea&s;ed with others hatred and contempt. For plea&s;ures and unea&s;ine&s;&s;es of this kind are doubtle&s;s as much owing to an immediate determina|tion
<PB N="148" REF="009962_0154_0F7B3D8746F00FE0">
of the mind by a fixed law of our nature, as any of the plea&s;ures or pains of external &s;en&s;e. And the&s;e plea&s;ures are properly of the private and per&s;onal kind; being not by any participation of the happine&s;s or &s;orrow of others, through benevolence. 'Tis evidently meer &s;elf-love, that appears in this di&s;po&s;ition. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that a man's love to him&s;elf will make him love love to him&s;elf, and hate hatred to him&s;elf. And as God has con&s;tituted our nature, &s;elf-love is exerci&s;ed in no one di&s;po&s;ition more than in this, Men, probably, are capable of much more plea&s;ure and pain thro' this determination of the mind, than by any other per&s;onal inclination, or aver&s;ion, what&s;oever. Tho' perhaps we don't &s;o very often &s;ee in&s;tances of extreme &s;uffering by this means, as by &s;ome others, yet we often &s;ee evidences of men's dreading the contempt of others more than death: and by &s;uch in&s;tances may conceive &s;omething what men would &s;uffer, if univer&s;ally hated and de&s;pi&s;ed; and may rea&s;onably infer &s;omething of the greatne&s;s of the mi&s;ery, that would ari&s;e under a &s;en&s;e of univer&s;al abhorrence, in a great view of intelligent Being in general, or in a clear view of the Deity, as incomprehen&s;ibly and immen&s;ely great, &s;o that all other Beings, are as nothing and vanity,&mdash;to|gether with a &s;en&s;e of his immediate continual pre&s;ence, and an infinite concern with him and dependence upon him,&mdash;and living con&s;tantly in the mid&s;t of mo&s;t clear and &s;trong evidences and manife&s;tations of his hatred and contempt and wrath.</P>
<P>BUT to return,&mdash;The&s;e things may be &s;ufficient to explain what I mean by private intere&s;t; in regard to which, &s;elf-love, mo&s;t properly &s;o called, is immediately exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>AND here I would ob&s;erve, that if we take &s;elf-love in this &s;en&s;e, &s;o love to &s;ome others may truly be the effect of &s;elf-love; i. e. according to the common method and order, which is maintain'd in the laws of nature. For no created thing has power to produce an effect any otherwi&s;e than by virtue of the laws of nature. Thus, that a man &s;hould love tho&s;e that are of his party, when there are dif|ferent parties contending one with another; and that are warmly engaged on his &s;ide, and promote his intere&s;t,&mdash;
<PB N="149" REF="009962_0155_0F7B3D87FB6CB908">
this is the natural con&s;equence of a private &s;elf-love. In|deed there is no metaphy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity, in the nature of things, that becau&s;e a man loves him&s;elf, and regards his own intere&s;t, he therefore &s;hould love tho&s;e that love him, and promote his intere&s;t; i. e. to &s;uppo&s;e it to be other|wi&s;e, implies no contradiction. It will not follow from any ab&s;olute metaphy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity, that becau&s;e bodies have &s;olidity, cohe&s;ion, and gravitation towards the centre of the earth, therefore a weight &s;u&s;pended on the beam of a balance &s;hould have greater power to counter-balance a weight on the other &s;ide, when at a di&s;tance from the fulcrum, than when it is near. It implies no contradicti|on, that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e: but only as it contradicts that beautiful proportion and harmony, which the author of nature ob&s;erves in the laws of nature he has e&s;tabli&s;hed. Neither is there any ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, the contrary imply|ing a contradiction, that becau&s;e there is an internal mu|tual attraction of the parts of the earth, or any other &s;phere, whereby the whole becomes one &s;olid coherent body, therefore other bodies that are around it, &s;hould al&s;o be attracted by it, and tho&s;e that are neare&s;t, be attracted mo&s;t. But according to the order and proportion general|ly ob&s;erved in the laws of nature, one of the&s;e effects is connected with the other, &s;o that it is ju&s;tly look'd upon as the &s;ame power of attraction in the globe of the earth, which draws bodies about the earth towards its centre, with that which attracts the parts of the earth them&s;elves one to another; only exerted under different circum&s;tances. By a like order of nature, a man's love to tho&s;e that love him, is no more than a certain expre&s;&s;ion or effect of &s;elf-love. No other principle is needful in order to the effect, if nothing intervenes to counter-vail the natural tendency of &s;elf-love. Therefore there is no more true virtue in a Man's thus loving his friends meerly from &s;elf-love, than there is in &s;elf-love it&s;elf, the principle from whence it pro|ceeds. So, a man's being di&s;po&s;ed to hate tho&s;e that hate him, or to re&s;ent injuries done him, ari&s;es from &s;elf-love in like manner as the loving tho&s;e that love us, and being thankful for kindne&s;s &s;hewn us.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid by &s;ome, that 'tis apparent, there is &s;ome other principle concerned in exciting the pa&s;&s;ions of grati|tude

and anger, be&s;ides &s;elf-love, viz. a moral &s;en&s;e, or &s;en&s;e of moral beauty and deformity, determining the minds of all mankind to approve of, and be plea&s;ed with virtue, and to di&s;approve of vice, and behold it with di&s;plicence; and that their &s;eeing or &s;uppo&s;ing this moral beauty or deformity, in the kindne&s;s of a benefactor, or oppo&s;ition of an adver&s;ary, is the occa&s;ion of the&s;e affections of gratitude or anger. Otherwi&s;e, why are not the&s;e affections excited in us towards inanimate things, that do us good, or hurt? Why don't we experience gratitude to a garden, or fruitful field? And why are we not angry with a tempe&s;t, or bla&s;t|ing mildew, or an overflowing &s;tream? We are very dif|ferently affected towards tho&s;e that do us good from the virtue of genero&s;ity, or hurt us from the vice of envy and malice, than towards things that hurt or help us, which are de&s;titute of rea&s;on and will.&mdash;Now concerning this, I would make &s;everal remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. THOSE who thus argue, that gratitude and anger can't proceed from &s;elf-love, might argue in the &s;ame way and with equal rea&s;on, that neither can the&s;e affections a|ri&s;e from love to others: which is contrary to their own &s;cheme.</P>
<P>THEY &s;ay, that the rea&s;on why we are affected with gra|titude and anger towards men, rather than things without life, is moral &s;en&s;e: which they &s;ay, is the effect of that principle of benevolence or love to others, or love to the public, which is naturally in the hearts of all mankind.&mdash;But now I might &s;ay, according to their own way of argu|ing, gratitude and anger cannot ari&s;e from love to o|thers, or love to the public, or any &s;en&s;e of mind that is the fruit of public affection. For, how differently are we affected towards tho&s;e that do good or hurt to the public from under&s;tanding and will, and from a general public &s;pirit, or public motive,&mdash;I &s;ay, how differently affected are we towards the&s;e, from what we are towards &s;uch inani|mate things as the &s;un and the clouds, that do good to the public, by enlightning and enlivening beams and refre&s;h|ing &s;howers; or mildew, and an overflowing &s;tream, that does hurt to the public, by de&s;troying the fruits of the earth! Yea, if &s;uch a kind of argument be good, it will prove that
<PB N="151" REF="009962_0157_0F7B3D89DEE42078">
gratitude and anger cannot ari&s;e from the united influence of &s;elf-love, and public love, or moral &s;en&s;e ari&s;ing from public affection. For, if &s;o, why are we not affected to|wards inanimate things, that are beneficial or injurious both to us and the public, in the &s;ame manner as to them that are profitable or hurtful to both on choice and de&s;ign, and from benevolence, or malice?</P>
<P N="2">2. On the &s;uppo&s;ition of its being indeed &s;o, that men love tho&s;e who love them, &amp; are angry with tho&s;e who hate them, from the natural influence of &s;elf-love; 'tis not at all &s;trange that the author of nature, who ob&s;erves order, uniformity and harmony in e&s;tabli&s;hing its laws, &s;hould &s;o order that it &s;hould be natural for &s;elf-love to cau&s;e the mind to be affected differently towards exceedingly diffe|rent objects; and that it &s;hould cau&s;e our heart to extend it&s;elf in one manner towards inanimate things, which gra|tify &s;elf-love, without &s;en&s;e or will, and in another manner towards Beings which we look upon as having under&s;tand|ing and will, like our&s;elves, and exerting the&s;e faculties in our favor, and promoting our intere&s;t from love to us. No wonder, &s;eeing we love our&s;elves, that it &s;hould be natural to us to extend &s;omething of that &s;ame kind of love which we have for our&s;elves, to them who are the &s;ame kind of Beings as our&s;elves, and comply with the inclinations of our &s;elf-love, by expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame &s;ort of love to|wards us.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF we &s;hould allow that to be univer&s;al, that in gra|titude and anger there is the exerci&s;e of &s;ome kind of mo|ral &s;en&s;e (as 'tis granted, there is &s;omething that may be &s;o called.) All the moral &s;en&s;e, that is e&s;&s;ential to tho&s;e af|fections, is a &s;en&s;e of DESERT; which is to be refer'd to that &s;en&s;e of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> before &s;poken of, con&s;i&s;ting in an ap|prehen&s;ion of that &s;econdary kind of beauty, that lies in uniformity and proportion: which &s;olves all the difficulty in the objection.&mdash;This, or &s;ome appearance of it, to a narrow private view, indeed attends all anger and gratitude. Others love and kindne&s;s to us, or their ill-will and inju|riou&s;ne&s;s, appears to us to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> our love, or our re&s;entment. Or, in other words, it &s;eems to us no other than <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> that as they love us, and do us good, we al&s;o &s;hould love them,
<PB N="152" REF="009962_0158_0F7B3D8A813A4908">
and do them good. And &s;o it &s;eems <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> that when others hearts oppo&s;e us, and they from their hearts do us hurt, our hearts &s;hould oppo&s;e them, and that we &s;hould de&s;ire they them&s;elves may &s;uffer in like manner as we have &s;uf|fered: i. e. there appears to us to be a natural agree|ment, proportion, and adju&s;tment between the&s;e things. Which is indeed a kind of moral &s;en&s;e, or &s;en&s;e of a beauty in moral things. But, as was before &s;hewn, it is a moral &s;en&s;e of a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> kind, and is intirely different from a &s;en&s;e or reli&s;h of the origi|nal e&s;&s;ential beauty of true virtue; and may be without any principle of true virtue in the heart. Therefore doubtle&s;s 'tis a great <HI>mi&s;take</HI> in any to &s;uppo&s;e, all that mo|ral &s;en&s;e which appears and is exerci&s;ed in a &s;en&s;e of <HI>de&s;ert,</HI> is the &s;ame thing as a love of virtue, or a di&s;po&s;ition and determination of mind to be plea&s;ed with true virtuous beauty, con&s;i&s;ting in publick benevolence. Which may be further confirm'd, if it be con&s;idered that even with re&s;pect to a &s;en&s;e of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> or <HI>de&s;ert,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in uniformity [and agree|ment between others actions towards us, and our actions towards them, in a way of well-doing, or of ill-doing] 'tis not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the being of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of gratitude and anger, that there &s;hould be any notion of ju&s;tice in them, in any publick or general view of things;&mdash;as will appear by what &s;hall be next ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="4">4. THOSE authors, who hold that that moral &s;en&s;e which is natural to all man-kind, con&s;i&s;ts in a natural re|li&s;h of the beauty of virtue, and &s;o ari&s;es from a principle of true virtue implanted by nature in the hearts of all&mdash;they hold that true virtue con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>publick benevolence.</HI> Therefore, if the affections of gratitude and anger nece&s;|&s;arily imply &s;uch a moral &s;en&s;e as they &s;uppo&s;e, then the&s;e affections imply &s;ome delight in the publick good, and an aver&s;ion of the mind to publick evil. And if this were &s;o, then every time any man feels anger for oppo&s;ition he meets with, or gratitude for any favour, there mu&s;t be at lea&s;t a &s;uppo&s;ition of a tendency to publick injury in that oppo&s;ition, and a tendency to publick benefit in the favour that excites his gratitude. But how far is this from being true? As, in &s;uch in&s;tances as the&s;e, which, I pre&s;ume, none will deny to be po&s;&s;ible, or unlike to any thing that

ever happens among mankind. A &s;hip's crew enter into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the ma&s;ter, to murder him, and run away with the &s;hip, and turn pirates: but before they bring their matters to a ripene&s;s for execution, one of them re|pents, and opens the whole de&s;ign; whereupon the re&s;t are apprehended and brought to ju&s;tice. The crew are enraged with him that has betray'd them, and earne&s;tly &s;eek op|portunity to revenge them&s;elves upon him.&mdash;And for an in&s;tance of gratitude, a gang of robbers that have long infe&s;ted the neighbouring country, have a particular hou&s;e whither they re&s;ort, and where they meet from time to time, to divide their booty or prey, and hold their con&s;ul|tations for carrying on their pernicious de&s;igns. The ma|gi&s;trates and officers of the country, after many fruitle&s;s en|deavours to di&s;cover their &s;ecret haunt and place of re&s;ort, at length by &s;ome means are well informed where it is, and are prepared with &s;ufficient force to &s;urprize them, and &s;ieze them all, at the place of rendezvous, at an hour ap|pointed when they under&s;tand they will all be there. A lit|tle before the arrival of the appointed hour, while the offi|cers with their bands are approaching, &s;ome per&s;on is &s;o kind to the&s;e robbers, as to give them notice of their dan|ger, &s;o as ju&s;t to give them opportunity to e&s;cape. They are thankful to him, and give him a handful of money for his kindne&s;s.&mdash;Now in &s;uch in&s;tances, I think, it is plain, that there is no &s;uppo&s;ition of a public injury in that which is the occa&s;ion of their <HI>anger;</HI> yea, they know the contrary. Nor is there any &s;uppo&s;ition of public good in that which excites their <HI>gratitude;</HI> neither has publick benevolence, or moral &s;en&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting in a determination to approve of what is for the public good, any influence at all in the affair. And though there be &s;ome affection, be|&s;ides a &s;en&s;e of uniformity and proportion, that has influence in &s;uch anger and gratitude, it is not public affection or benevolence, but private affection; yea, that affection which is to the highe&s;t degree private, con&s;i&s;ting in a man's love of his own per&s;on.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>anger,</HI> in particular, &s;eems to have been unluckily cho&s;en as a medium to prove a &s;en&s;e and determination to delight in virtue, con&s;i&s;ting in benevolence, natural to all mankind.</P>

FOR, if that moral &s;en&s;e which is exerci&s;ed in anger, were that which aro&s;e from a benevolent temper of heart, being no other than a &s;en&s;e or reli&s;h of the beauty of benevolence, one would think, a di&s;po&s;ition to anger &s;hould increa&s;e, at lea&s;t in &s;ome proportion, as a man had more of a &s;weet, benign, and benevolent temper: which &s;eems &s;omething di&s;agreable to rea&s;on, as well as contrary to experience, which &s;hews that the le&s;s men have of benevolence, and the more they have of a contrary temper, the more are they di&s;po&s;ed to anger and deep re&s;entment of injuries.</P>
<P>AND though <HI>gratitude</HI> be that which many &s;peak of as a certain noble principle of virtue, which God has implanted in the hearts of all mankind; and though it be true, there is a gratitude, that is truly virtuous, and the want of grati|tude, or an ungrateful temper, is truly vicious, and argues an abominable depravity of heart (as I may have particular occa&s;ion to &s;hew afterwards) yet I think, what has been ob&s;erved, may &s;erve to convince &s;uch as impartially con|&s;ider it, not only that not all anger, or hating tho&s;e which hate us, but al&s;o that not all gratitude, or loving tho&s;e which love us, ari&s;es from a truly virtuous benevolence of heart.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;ort of affections, which may be properly re|fer'd to &s;elf-love, as its &s;ource, and which might be expect|ed to be the fruit of it, according to the general analogy of nature's laws, is affections to &s;uch as are near to us by the ties of nature; that we look upon as tho&s;e who&s;e Beings we have been the occa&s;ions of, and that we have a very peculiar propriety in, and who&s;e circum&s;tances, even from the fir&s;t beginning of their exi&s;tence, do many ways lead them, as it were nece&s;&s;arily, to an high e&s;teem of us, and to treat us with great dependence, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and compli|ance; and whom the con&s;titution of the world makes to be united in intere&s;t, and accordingly to act as one in innu|merable affairs, with a communion in each other's affecti|ons, de&s;ires, cares, friend&s;hips, enmities, and pur&s;uits. Which is the ca&s;e of men's affection to their children.&mdash;And in like manner &s;elf-love will al&s;o beget in a man &s;ome degree of affections towards others, with whom he has connection in any degree parallel.&mdash;As to the opinion of

tho&s;e that a&s;cribe the natural affection there is between pa|rents and children, to a particular <HI>in&s;tinct</HI> of nature, I &s;hall take notice of it afterwards.</P>
<P>AND as men may love per&s;ons and things from &s;elf-love, &s;o may love to qualities and characters ari&s;e from the &s;ame &s;ource. Some repre&s;ent as though there were need of a great degree of metaphy&s;ical refining, to make it out, that men approve of others from &s;elf-love, whom they hear of at a di&s;tance, or read of in hi&s;tory, or &s;ee repre&s;ented on the &s;tage, from whom they expect no profit or advantage. But perhaps it is not con&s;idered, that what we approve of in the fir&s;t place, is the character; and from the character we approve the per&s;on. And is it a &s;trange thing, that men &s;hould from &s;elf-love like a temper or character, which in its nature and tendency falls in with the nature and ten|dency of &s;elf-love; and which, we know by experience and &s;elf-evidence, without metaphy&s;ical refining, in the general tends to men's plea&s;ure and benefit?&mdash;And on the contrary, &s;hould di&s;like what they &s;ee tends to men's pain and mi&s;ery?&mdash;Is there need of a great degree of &s;ubtilty and ab&s;traction, to make it out, that a child, which has heard and &s;een much, &s;trongly to fix an idea, of the perni|cious deadly nature of the rattle-&s;nake, &s;hould have aver|&s;ion to that &s;pecies or form, from &s;elf-love; &s;o as to have a degree of this aver&s;ion and di&s;gu&s;t excited by &s;eeing even the picture of that animal? And that from the &s;ame &s;elf-love it &s;hould be plea&s;ed and entertain'd with a lively figure and repre&s;entation of &s;ome plea&s;ant fruit, which it has often ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of? or, with the image of &s;ome bird, which, it has always been told, is innocent, and who&s;e plea&s;ant &s;inging it has often been entertain'd with?&mdash;Though, the child neither fears being bitten by the picture of the &s;nake, nor expects to eat of the painted fruit, or to hear the figure of the bird &s;ing. I &s;uppo&s;e none, will think it difficult to allow, that &s;uch an approbation or di&s;gu&s;t of a child may be accounted for from its natural delight in the plea&s;ures of ta&s;te and hearing, and its aver&s;ion to pain and death, through &s;elf-love, together with the habitual con|nection of the&s;e agreeable or terrible ideas with the form and qualities of the&s;e objects, the ideas of which are im|pre&s;&s;ed on the mind of the child by their images.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="009962_0162_0F7B3D8D4A302780">
AND where is the difficulty of allowing, that a child or man may hate the general character of a &s;piteful and ma|licious man, for the like rea&s;on as he hates the general na|ture of a &s;erpent; knowing, from rea&s;on, in&s;truction and experience, that malice in men is pernicious to mankind, as well as &s;pite or poi&s;on in a &s;erpent? And if a man may from &s;elf-love di&s;approve the vices of malice, envy, and o|thers of that &s;ort, which naturally tend to the hurt of man|kind, why may he not from the &s;ame principle approve the contrary virtues of meekne&s;s, peaceablene&s;s, benevolence, charity, genero&s;ity, ju&s;tice, and the &s;ocial virtues in gene|ral; which, he as ea&s;ily and clearly knows, naturally tend to the good of mankind?</P>
<P>'TIS undoubtedly true, that &s;ome have a love to the&s;e virtues from a higher principle. But yet I think it as certainly true, that there is generally in mankind, a &s;ort of approbation of them, which ari&s;es from &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>BESIDES what has been already &s;aid, the &s;ame thing fur|ther appears from this; that men commonly are mo&s;t af|fected towards, and do mo&s;t highly approve, tho&s;e virtues which agree with their intere&s;t mo&s;t, according to their various conditions in life. We &s;ee that per&s;ons of low condition are e&s;pecially enamour'd with a conde&s;cending, acce&s;&s;ible, affable temper in the great; not only in tho&s;e who&s;e conde&s;cention has been exerci&s;ed towards them|&s;elves; but they will be peculiarly taken with &s;uch a cha|racter when they have accounts of it from others, or when they meet with it in hi&s;tory, or even in romance.&mdash;The poor will mo&s;t highly approve and commend liberality.&mdash;The weaker &s;ex, who e&s;pecially need a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protec|tion, will peculiarly e&s;teem and applaud fortitude and ge|nero&s;ity in tho&s;e of the other &s;ex, they read or hear of, or have repre&s;ented to them on a &s;tage.</P>
<P>AS I think it plain from what has been ob&s;erved, that men may approve, and be di&s;po&s;ed to commend a benevo|lent temper, from &s;elf-love, &s;o the higher the degree of be|nevolence is, the more may they approve of it. Which will account for &s;ome kind of approbation, from this prin|ciple, even of love to enemies; viz. as a man's loving his
<PB N="157" REF="009962_0163_0F7B3D8DFA071658">
enemies is an evidence of a high degree of benevolence of temper;&mdash;the degree of it appearing from the ob&s;tacles it overcomes.</P>
<P>AND it may be here ob&s;erved, that the con&s;ideration of the tendency and influence of &s;elf-love may &s;hew, how men in general may approve of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> from another ground, be&s;ides that approbation of the &s;econdary beauty there is in uniformity and proportion, which is natural to all. Men from their infancy &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of it, not only that it is nece&s;&s;ary for others, or for human &s;ociety; but they find the nece&s;&s;ity of it for them&s;elves, in in&s;tances that continu|ally occur: which tends to prejudice them in its favor, and to fix an habitual approbation of it from &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>AND again, that forementioned approbation of ju&s;tice and de&s;ert, ari&s;ing from a &s;en&s;e of the beauty of natural a|greement and proportion, will have a kind of reflex, and indirect influence to cau&s;e men to approve benevolence, and di&s;approve malice; as men &s;ee that he who hates and injures others, de&s;erves to be hated and puni&s;hed, and that he who is benevolent, and loves others, and does them good, de&s;erves him&s;elf al&s;o to be loved &amp; rewarded by others, as they &s;ee the natural congruity or agreement and mutual adaptedne&s;s of the&s;e things. And having always &s;een this, malevolence becomes habitually connected in the mind with the idea of being hated and puni&s;hed, which is di&s;a|greable to &s;elf-love; and the idea of benevolence is habi|tually connected and a&s;&s;ociated with the idea of being lov|ed and rewarded by others, which is grateful to &s;elf-love. And by virtue of this a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, benevolence it|&s;elf becomes grateful, and the contrary di&s;plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>SOME vices may become in a degree odious by the in|fluence of &s;elf-love, thro' an habitual connection of ideas of contempt with it; contempt being what &s;elf-love abhors. So it may often be with drunkenne&s;s, gluttony, &s;otti&s;hne&s;s, cowardice, &s;loth, niggardline&s;s.&mdash;The idea of contempt becomes a&s;&s;ociated with the idea of &s;uch vices, both becau&s;e we are u&s;ed to ob&s;erve that the&s;e things are commo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ob|jects of contempt, and al&s;o find that they excite contempt in our&s;elves.&mdash;Some of them appear marks of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,

i. e. of &s;mall abilities, and weakne&s;s of mind, and in&s;uffici|ency for any con&s;iderable effects among mankind.&mdash;By others, men's influence is contracted into a narrow &s;phere, and by &s;uch means per&s;ons become of le&s;s importance, and more in&s;ignificant among mankind. And things of little importance are naturally little accounted of.&mdash;And &s;ome of the&s;e ill qualities are &s;uch as mankind find it their inte|re&s;t to treat with contempt, as they are very hurtful to hu|man &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THERE are no particular moral virtues what&s;oever, but what in &s;ome or other of the&s;e ways, &amp; mo&s;t of them in &s;everal of the&s;e ways, come to have &s;ome kind of approbation from &s;elf love, without the influence of a truly virtuous princi|ple; nor any particular vices, but what by the &s;ame means meet with &s;ome di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>THIS kind of approbation and di&s;like, thro' the joint-influence of &s;elf-love and a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, is in very many va&s;tly heightned by education; as this is the means of a &s;trong, clo&s;e, and almo&s;t irrefragable a&s;&s;ociation, in in|numerable in&s;tances, of ideas which have no connexion any other way than by education; and of greatly &s;trengthning that a&s;&s;ociation, or connexion, which per&s;ons are led into by other means: as any one would be convinced, perhaps more effectually than in mo&s;t other ways, if they had op|portunity of any con&s;iderable acquaintance with <HI>American</HI> &s;avages and their children.</P>

<P>THERE is yet another di&s;po&s;ition or principle, of great importance, natural to mankind; which, if we con|&s;ider the con&s;i&s;tence and harmony of nature's laws, may al&s;o be look'd upon as in &s;ome &s;ort ari&s;ing from &s;elf-love, or &s;elf-union: and that is a di&s;po&s;ition in man to be unea&s;y in a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, and as it were, again&s;t him&s;elf, in his own acti|ons. This appears particularly in the inclination
<PB N="159" REF="009962_0165_0F7B3D90D227A8C8">
of the mind to be unea&s;y in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing that to others, which he &s;hould be angry with them for doing to him, if they were in his ca&s;e, and he in theirs; or, of forbearing to do that to them, which he would be di&s;plea&s;ed with them for neglecting to do to him.</P>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved from time to time, that in pure love to others (i. e. love not ari&s;ing from &s;elf-love) there's an uni|on of the heart with others; a kind of enlargement of the mind, whereby it &s;o extends it&s;elf as to take others into a man's &s;elf: and therefore it implies a di&s;po&s;ition to feel, to de&s;ire, and to act as tho' others were one with our&s;elves. So, &s;elf-love implies an inclination to feel and act as one with our&s;elves: which naturally renders a &s;en&s;ible incon|&s;i&s;tence with our&s;elves, and &s;elf-oppo&s;ition, in what we our|&s;elves chu&s;e and do, to be unea&s;y to the mind: which will cau&s;e unea&s;ine&s;s of mind to be the con&s;equence of a male volent and unju&s;t behaviour towards others and a kind of di&s;approbation of acts of this nature, and an approbation of the contrary. To do that to another, which we &s;hould be angry with him for doing to us, and to hate a per&s;on for doing that to us, which we &s;hould incline to and in&s;i&s;t on doing to him, if we were exactly in the &s;ame ca&s;e, is to di&s;agree with our&s;elves, and contradict our&s;elves. It would be, for our&s;elves both to chu&s;e and adhere to, and yet to refu&s;e and utterly reject, as it were the very &s;ame thing. No wonder, this is contrary to nature. No wonder, that &s;uch a &s;elf-oppo&s;ition, and inward war with a man's &s;elf, naturally begets unquietne&s;s, and rai&s;es di&s;turbance in his mind.</P>
<P>A THUS approving of actions, becau&s;e we therein act as in agreement with our&s;elves, or as one with our&s;elves,&mdash;and a thus di&s;approving and being unea&s;y in the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of di&s;agreeing and being incon&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves in what we do,&mdash;is quite a different thing from approving or di&s;approving actions becau&s;e in them we agree and are united with Being in general: which is loving or hating actions from a &s;en&s;e of the primary beauty of true virtue, and odiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in.&mdash;The former of the&s;e principles is private: the latter is public and truly benevolent in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e. The former (i. e. an inclination to agree
<PB N="160" REF="009962_0166_0F7B3D9180AD1498">
with our&s;elves) is a natural principle: but the latter (i. e. an agreement or union of heart to the great &s;y&s;tem, and to God, the head of it, who is all and all in it) is a divine principle.</P>
<P>IN that unea&s;ine&s;s now mentioned, con&s;i&s;ts very much of that inward trouble men have from reflections of con|&s;cience: and when they are free from this unea&s;ine&s;s, and are con&s;cious to them&s;elves, that in what they have acted towards others, they have done the &s;ame which they &s;hould have expected from them in the &s;ame ca&s;e, then they have what is called peace of con&s;cience, with re&s;pect to the&s;e actions. And there is al&s;o an approbation of con&s;cience, of the conduct of others towards our&s;elves. As when we are blamed, condemned, or puni&s;hed by them, and are con&s;cious to our&s;elves that if we were in their ca&s;e, and they in ours, we &s;hould in like manner, blame, condemn, and puni&s;h them. And thus men's con&s;ciences may ju&s;tify God's anger and condemnation. When they have the ideas of God's greatne&s;s, their relation to him, the benefits they have received from him, the manife&s;tations he has made of his will to them, &amp;c. &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on their minds, a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is excited within them of tho&s;e re|&s;entments, which would be occa&s;ion'd in them&s;elves by an injurious treatment in any wi&s;e parallel.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;uch a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s as this oftentimes within men, imply'd in the thoughts and views of the mind, which perhaps on reflection they could hardly give an ac|count of. Unle&s;s men's con&s;ciences are greatly &s;tupify'd, it is naturally and nece&s;&s;arily &s;ugge&s;ted; and does habitu|ally, &s;pontaneou&s;ly, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and as it were in&s;en&s;i|bly ari&s;e in the mind. And the more &s;o for this rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> that we have not, nor ever had from our infancy, any other way to conceive of any thing which other per&s;ons act or &s;uffer, or of any thing about intelligent, moral agents, but by recalling and exciting the ideas of what we our&s;elves are con&s;cious of in the acts, pa&s;&s;ions, &s;en&s;ations, volitions, &amp;c. which we have found in our own minds; and by put|ting the ideas which we obtain by this means, in the place of another; or as it were &s;ub&s;tituting our&s;elves in their place. Thus, we have no conception, in any degree, what
<PB N="161" REF="009962_0167_0F7B3D91C31C0928">
under&s;tanding, perception, love, plea&s;ure, pain, or de&s;ire are in others, but by putting our&s;elves as it were in their &s;tead, or transferring the ideas we obtain of &s;uch things in our own minds by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, into their place; making &s;uch an alteration, as to degree and circum&s;tances, as what we ob&s;erve of them requires. 'Tis thus in all moral things that we conceive of in others, which are all mental, and not corporeal things; and every thing that we conceive of, belonging to others, more than &s;hape, &s;ize, complexion, &s;ituation, and motion of their bodies. And this is the only way that we come to be capable of having ideas of any perception or act even of the Godhead. We never could have any notion what under&s;tanding or vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ion, love or hatred are, either in created &s;pirits or in God, if we had never experienced what under&s;tanding and volition, love and hatred are in our own minds. Knowing what they are by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, we can add degrees, and deny limits, and remove changeablene&s;s and other imperfections, and a&s;cribe them to God. Which is the only way we come to be ca|pable of conceiving of any thing in the Deity.</P>
<P>BUT though it be &s;o, that men in thinking of others do as it were put them&s;elves in their place, they do it &s;o na|turally, or rather habitually, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and without &s;et purpo&s;e, that they do it in&s;en&s;ibly, and can &s;carce give any account of it, and many would think &s;trange if they were told of it. So it may be in men's &s;ub&s;tituting them|&s;elves in others place in &s;uch exerci&s;es of con&s;cience as have been &s;poken of: and the former &s;ub&s;titution leads to the latter, in one who&s;e con&s;cience is not greatly &s;tupified. For in all his thoughts of the other per&s;on, in whatever he apprehends or conceives of his moral conduct to others or to him&s;elf, if it be in loving or hating him, approving or condemning him, rewarding or puni&s;hing him, he nece&s;|&s;arily as it were puts him&s;elf in his &s;tead, for the foremen|tioned rea&s;on; and therefore the more naturally, ea&s;ily and quietly &s;ees whether he being in his place &s;hould approve or condemn, be angry or plea&s;ed as he is.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="009962_0168_0F7B3D9297F400F8">
Natural con&s;cience con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. IN that which has now been &s;poken of: that di&s;po|&s;ition to approve or di&s;approve the moral treatment which pa&s;&s;es between us and others, from a determination of the mind to be ea&s;y, or unea&s;y, in a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our being con&s;i&s;tent, or incon&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves. Hereby we have a di&s;po&s;ition to approve our own treatment of another, when we are con&s;cious to our&s;elves that we treat him &s;o as we &s;hould expect to be treated by him, were he in our ca&s;e and we in his; and to di&s;approve of our own treat|ment of another, when we are con&s;cious that we &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed, with the like treatment from him, if we were in his ca&s;e. So we in our con&s;ciences approve of another's treatment of us, if we are con&s;cious to our&s;elves, that if we were in his ca&s;e, and he in ours, we &s;hould think it ju&s;t to treat him as he treats us; and di&s;approve his treatment of us, when we are con&s;cious that we &s;hould think it un|ju&s;t, if we were in his ca&s;e. Thus men's con&s;ciences ap|prove or di&s;approve the &s;entence of their judge, by which they are acquitted or condemned.&mdash;But this is not all that is in natural con&s;cience. Be&s;ides this approving or di&s;approving from unea&s;ine&s;s as being incon&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves, there is another thing that mu&s;t preceed it, and be the foundation of it. As for in&s;tance, when my con|&s;cience di&s;approves my own treatment of another, being con&s;cious to my&s;elf, that were I in his ca&s;e, I &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed and angry with him for &s;o treating me, the que&s;tion might be a&s;ked, but what would be the ground of that &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;approbation, di&s;plea&s;ure and anger, which I am con&s;cious would be in me in that ca&s;e?&mdash;That di&s;approbation mu&s;t be on &s;ome other grounds.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE other thing which belongs to the approbation or di&s;approbation of natural con&s;cience, is the &s;en&s;e of de|&s;ert, which was &s;poken of before: con&s;i&s;ting, as was ob|&s;erved, in a natural agreement, proportion and harmony between malevolence or injury and re&s;entment and puni&s;h|ment; or between loving and being loved, between &s;hew|ing kindne&s;s and being rewarded, &amp;c. Both the&s;e kinds
<PB N="163" REF="009962_0169_0F7B3D9356058AF0">
of approving or di&s;approving concur in the approbation or di&s;approbation of con&s;cience: the one founded on the other. Thus, when a man's con&s;cience di&s;approves of his treat|ment of his neighbour, in the fir&s;t place he is con&s;cious that if he were in his neighbours &s;tead, he &s;hould re&s;ent &s;uch treatment, from a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, or from a &s;en&s;e of uniformity and equality between &s;uch treatment and re|&s;entment and puni&s;hment; as before explained. And then in the next place he perceives, that therefore he is not con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, in doing what he him&s;elf &s;hould re&s;ent in that ca&s;e; and hence di&s;approves it, as being na|turally aver&s;e to oppo&s;ition to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>APPROBATION and di&s;approbation of con&s;cience, in the &s;en&s;e now explained, will extend to all virtue and vice; to every thing what&s;oever that is morally good or evil, in a mind which does not confine its view to a private &s;phere, but will take things in general into its con&s;ideration, &amp; is free from &s;peculative error. For, as all virtue or moral good may be re&s;olved into love to others, either God or creatures, &s;o men ea&s;ily &s;ee the uniformity and natural agreement there is between loving others, and being accepted and favored by others. And all vice, &s;in, or moral evil &s;ummarily con&s;i&s;ting in the want of this love to others, or in the con|trary, <HI>viz.</HI> hatred or malevolence, &s;o men ea&s;ily &s;ee the natural agreement there is between hating and doing ill to others, and being hated by them and &s;uffering ill from them, or from him that acts for all and has the care of the whole Sy&s;tem. And as this &s;en&s;e of equality and natural agreement extends to all moral good and evil, &s;o this lays a foundation of an equal extent with the other kind of ap|probation and di&s;approbation, which is grounded upon it, ari&s;ing from an aver&s;ion to &s;elf-incon&s;i&s;tence and oppo&s;ition. For in all ca&s;es of benevolence or the contrary towards others, we are capable of putting our&s;elves in the place of others, and are naturally led to do it, and &s;o of reflecting, or being con&s;cious to our&s;elves, how we &s;hould like or di&s;like &s;uch treatment from others. Thus natural con&s;cience, if the under&s;tanding be properly enlightned, and errors and blinding &s;tupifying prejudices are removed, concurs with the law of God, and is of equal extent with it, and joins its voice with it in every article.</P>

AND thus, in particular, we may &s;ee in what re&s;pect this natural con&s;cience that has been de&s;cribed, extends to true virtue, con&s;i&s;ting in union of heart to Being in general, and &s;upreme love to God.

Men by natural con&s;ci|ence may &s;ee the ju&s;tice (or natural agreement) there is in yielding all to God, as we receive all from God; and the ju&s;tice there is in being his that has made us, and being willingly &s;o, which is the &s;ame as being dependent on his will, and conformed to his will in the manner of our Being, as we are for our Being it&s;elf, and in the conformity of our will to his will, on who&s;e will we are univer&s;ally and mo&s;t perfectly dependent; and al&s;o the ju&s;tice there is in our &s;upreme love to God, from his goodne&s;s,&mdash;the natural agreement there is between our having &s;upreme re&s;pect to him who exerci&s;es infinite goodne&s;s to us, and from whom we receive all well-being.&mdash;Be&s;ides that di&s;agreement and di&s;cord appears wor&s;e to natural &s;en&s;e (as was ob&s;erved before) in things nearly related and of great importance: and therefore it mu&s;t appear very ill, as it re&s;pects the infinite Being, and in that infinitely great relation which there is between the creator and his creatures. And 'tis ea&s;y to conceive how that &s;en&s;e which is in natural con&s;cience, &s;hould &s;ee the de&s;ert of puni&s;hment, which there is in the contrary of true virtue, viz. oppo&s;ition and enmity to Being in general.

Thus natural con&s;cience, if well inform'd, will approve of true virtue, and will di&s;approve and condemn the want of it, and oppo&s;ition to it; and yet without &s;eeing the true beauty of it. Yea, if men's con&s;ciences were fully

For they mu&s;t &s;ee that con&s;ent to Being in general, and &s;upreme re&s;pect to the Being of Beings, is mo&s;t ju&s;t; and that every thing which is incon&s;i&s;tent with it, and interferes with it, or flows from the want of it, is unju&s;t, and de&s;erves the oppo&s;ition of univer&s;al exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THUS has God e&s;tabli&s;hed and ordered, that this princi|ple of natural con&s;cience, which though it implies no &s;uch thing as actual benevolence to Being in general, nor any delight in &s;uch a principle, &s;imply con&s;ider'd, and &s;o implies no truly &s;piritual &s;en&s;e or virtuous ta&s;te, yet &s;hould approve and condemn the &s;ame things that are approved and con|demned by a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e or virtuous ta&s;te.</P>
<P>THAT moral &s;en&s;e which is natural to mankind, &s;o far as it is di&s;intere&s;ted, and not founded in a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, is the &s;ame with this natural con&s;cience that has been de|&s;cribed. The &s;en&s;e of moral good and evil, and that di&s;po|&s;ition to approve virtue, and di&s;approve vice, which men have by natural con&s;cience, is that moral &s;en&s;e, &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on in the writings of many of late: a mi&s;under|&s;tanding of which &s;eems to have been the thing that has mi&s;led tho&s;e morali&s;ts who have in&s;i&s;ted on a di&s;intere&s;ted moral &s;en&s;e, univer&s;al in the world of mankind, as an evi|dence of a di&s;po&s;ition to true virtue, con&s;i&s;ting in a benevo|lent temper, naturally implanted in the minds of all men. Some of the arguments made u&s;e of by the&s;e writers, do indeed prove that there is a moral &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te, univer&s;al among men, di&s;tinct from what ari&s;es from &s;elf-love.

in&s;tances prove that there is a moral ta&s;te, or &s;en&s;e of moral good and evil, natural to all, which don't properly ari&s;e from &s;elf-love Yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> conceive there are no in&s;tances of this kind which may no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> be refer'd to natural con&s;cience, and particularly to that which I have ob&s;erved to be primary in the approbation of natural con&s;cience, viz. a &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert and approbation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that natural agreement there is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> manner and mea&s;ure, in ju&s;tice.

<P>BUT it further appears from this&mdash;If the approbation of con&s;cience were the &s;ame with the approbation of the inclination of the heart, or the natural di&s;po&s;ition and de|termination of the mind, to love and be plea&s;ed with virtue, then approbation and condemnation of con&s;cience would always be in proportion to the virtuous temper of the mind; or rather, the degree would be ju&s;t the &s;ame. In that per&s;on who had a high degree of a virtuous temper, therefore, the te&s;timony of con&s;cience in favor of virtue would be e|qually full: But he that had but little, would have as little a degree of the te&s;timony of con&s;cience for virtue, &amp; again&s;t vice. But, I think, the ca&s;e is evidently otherwi&s;e. Some men, thro' the &s;trength of vice in their hearts, will go on in &s;in again&s;t clearer light and &s;tronger convictions of con&s;cience, than others. If con&s;cience's approving duty and di&s;appro|ving &s;in, were the &s;ame thing as the exerci&s;e of a virtuous principle of the heart, in loving duty and hating &s;in, then remor&s;e of con&s;cience will be the &s;ame thing as repentance: and ju&s;t in the &s;ame degree as the &s;inner feels remor&s;e of con&s;cience for &s;in&punc; in the &s;ame degree is his heart turned from the love of &s;in to the hatred of it, ina&s;much as they are the very &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANS have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, from the &s;criptures, that in the future day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God when &s;inners &s;hall be call'd to an&s;wer before their judge, and all their wickedne&s;s, in all

its aggravations, brought forth, and clearly manife&s;ted in the perfect light of that day, and God will reprove them, and &s;et their &s;ins in order before them, their con&s;ciences will be greatly awakened and convinced, their mouths will be &s;topped, all &s;tupidity of con&s;cience will be at an end, and con&s;cience will have its full exerci&s;e: and therefore their con&s;ciences will approve the dreadful &s;entence of the judge again&s;t them, and &s;eeing that they have de&s;erved &s;o great a puni&s;hment, will join with the judge in condemning them. And this, according to the notion I am oppo&s;ing, would be the &s;ame thing as their being brought to the fulle&s;t repent|ance; their hearts being perfectly changed to hate &s;in and love holine&s;s; and virtue or holine&s;s of heart in them will be brought to the mo&s;t full and perfect exerci&s;e. But how much otherwi&s;e, have we rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, it will then be? viz. That the &s;in and wickedne&s;s of their heart will come to its highe&s;t dominion and compleate&s;t exerci&s;e; that they &s;hall be wholly left of God, and given up to their wicked|ne&s;s, even as the devils are! When God has done wait|ing on &s;inners, and his &s;pirit done &s;triving with them, he will not re&s;train their wickedne&s;s, as he does now. But &s;in &s;hall then rage in their hearts, as a fire no longer re|&s;trained or kept under. 'Tis proper for a judge when he condemns a criminal, to endeavour &s;o to &s;et his guilt before him as to convince his con&s;cience of the ju&s;tice of the &s;en|tence. This the almighty will do effectually, and do to perfection, &s;o as mo&s;t thoro'ly to awaken and convince the con&s;cience. But if natural con&s;cience, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the heart to be plea&s;ed with virtue, were the &s;ame, then at the &s;ame time that the con&s;cience was brought to its perfect exerci&s;e, the heart would be made perfectly holy: or, would have the exerci&s;e of true virtue and holine&s;s in perfect benevolence of temper. But in&s;tead of this, their wickedne&s;s will then be brought to perfection, and wicked men will become very devils, and accordingly will be &s;ent away as cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing natural con&s;cience to be what has been de&s;cribed, all the&s;e difficulties and ab&s;urdities are wholly avoided. Sinners, when they &s;ee the greatne&s;s of the Be|ing, whom they have lived in contempt of, and in rebelli|on

In order to the&s;e things there is no need of a virtuous benevolent temper, reli&s;hing and de|lighting in benevolence, and loathing the contrary. The con&s;cience may &s;ee the natural agreement between oppo|&s;ing and being oppo&s;ed, between hating and being hated, without abhorring malevolence from a benevolent temper of mind, or without loving God from a view of the beau|ty of his holine&s;s.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">of particular in&s;tincts of nature, which in &s;ome re&s;pects re&s;emble virtue.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are various di&s;po&s;itions and inclinations natural to men, which depend on particular laws of nature, determining their minds to certain affections and actions towards particular objects; which laws &s;eem to be e&s;tab|li&s;hed chiefly for the pre&s;ervation of mankind, tho' not only for this, but al&s;o for their comfortably &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the world. Which di&s;po&s;itions may be called <HI>in&s;tincts.</HI></P>
<P>SOME of the&s;e in&s;tincts re&s;pect only our&s;elves per&s;onally: &s;uch are many of our natural appetites and aver&s;ions. Some of them are not wholly per&s;onal, but more &s;ocial, and extend to others: &s;uch are the mutual inclinations between
<PB N="169" REF="009962_0175_0F7B3D98888580D8">
the &s;exes, &amp;c.&mdash;Some of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions are more ex|ternal and &s;en&s;itive: &s;uch are &s;ome of our natural inclina|tions that are per&s;onal; as tho&s;e that relate to meat and drink. And of this &s;ort al&s;o are &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions that are more &s;ocial, and in &s;ome re&s;pects extend to others: as, the more &s;en&s;itive inclinations of the &s;exes towards each other. Be&s;ides the&s;e in&s;tincts of the &s;en&s;itive kind, there are others that are more internal and mental: con&s;i&s;ting in affections of the mind, which mankind naturally exerci&s;e towards &s;ome of their fellow-creatures, or in &s;ome ca&s;es towards men in general. Some of the&s;e in&s;tincts that are mental and &s;ocial, are what may be called kind affections; as hav|ing &s;omething in them of benevolence, or a re&s;emblence of it. And others are of a different &s;ort, having &s;omething in them that carries an angry appearance; &s;uch as the pa&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y between the &s;exes, e&s;pecially in the male towards the female.</P>
<P>'TIS only the former of the&s;e two la&s;t mentioned &s;orts, that it is to my purpo&s;e to con&s;ider in this place, <HI>viz</HI> tho&s;e natural in&s;tincts which appear in benevolent affections, or which have the appearence of benevolence, and &s;o in &s;ome re&s;pects re&s;emble virtue. The&s;e I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider; and &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew that none of them can be of the nature of true virtue.</P>
<P>THAT kind affection which is exerci&s;ed towards tho&s;e who are near one to another in natural relation, particu|larly the love of parents to their children, called natural affection, is by many refer'd to in&s;tinct. I have already con&s;idered this &s;ort of love as an affection that ari&s;es from &s;elf-love; and in that view, and in that &s;uppo&s;ition have &s;hewn, it cannot be of the nature of true virtue. But if any think, that natural affection is more properly to be re|fer'd to a particular in&s;tinct of nature, than to &s;elf-love, as its cau&s;e, I &s;hall not think it a point worthy of any contro|ver&s;y or di&s;pute. In my opinion, both are true; viz. that natural affection is owing to natural in&s;tinct, and al&s;o that it ari&s;es from &s;elf-love. It may be &s;aid to ari&s;e from in&s;tinct, as it depends on a law of nature. But yet it may be truly reckoned as an affection ari&s;ing from &s;elf-love; becau&s;e, tho' it ari&s;es from a law of nature, yet that is &s;uch a law as
<PB N="170" REF="009962_0176_0F7B3D995ABC15F0">
according to the order and harmony every where ob&s;erved among the laws of nature, is connected with, and follows from &s;elf-love: as was &s;hewn before. However, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to in&s;i&s;t on this. For if it be &s;o, that natural affection to a man's children or family, or near relations, is not properly to be a&s;cribed to &s;elf-love, as its cau&s;e, in any re&s;pect, but is to be e&s;teemed an affection ari&s;ing from a particular independent in&s;tinct of nature, which the creator in his wi&s;dom has implanted in men for the pre&s;ervation and well-being of the world of mankind, yet it cannot be of the nature of true virtue. For it has been ob&s;erved, and I humbly conceive, proved before (chap. II.) that if any Being or Beings have by natural in|&s;tinct, or any other means, a determination of mind to be|nevolence, extending only to &s;ome particular per&s;ons or private &s;y&s;tem, however large that &s;y&s;tem may be, or how|ever great a number of individuals it may contain, &s;o long as it contains but an infinitely &s;mall part of univer&s;al ex|i&s;tence, and &s;o bears no proportion to this great and univer|&s;al &s;y&s;tem,&mdash;&s;uch limited private benevolence, not a|ri&s;ing from, nor being &s;ubordinate to benevolence to Being in general, cannot have the nature of true virtue.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it may not be ami&s;s briefly to ob&s;erve now, that 'tis evident to a demon&s;tration, tho&s;e affections cannot be of the nature of true virtue, from the&s;e two things.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THAT they don't ari&s;e from a principle of vir|tue.&mdash;A principle of virtue, I think, is own'd by the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of late writers on morality to be general benevolence or public affection: and I think it has been proved to be union of heart to Being &s;imply con&s;idered; which implies a di&s;po&s;ition to benevolence to Being in ge|neral. Now by the &s;uppo&s;ition, the affections we are &s;peak|ing of do not ari&s;e from this principle; and that, whether we &s;uppo&s;e they ari&s;e from &s;elf-love, or from particular in|&s;tincts: becau&s;e either of tho&s;e &s;ources is diver&s;e from a principle of general benevolence.  And,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THESE private affections, if they do not ari&s;e from general benevolence, &amp; they are not connected with it in their fir&s;t exi&s;tence, have no tendency to produce it. This ap|pears
<PB N="171" REF="009962_0177_0F7B3D99F91E2D58">
from what has been ob&s;erved: for being not dependent on it, their detach'd and un&s;ubordinate operation rather tends to, and implies oppo&s;ition to Being in general, than general benevolence; as every one &s;ees and owns with re|&s;pect to &s;elf-love. And there are the very &s;ame rea&s;ons why any other private affection, confined to limits infinitely &s;hort of univer&s;al exi&s;tence, &s;hould have that influence, as well as love that is confined to a &s;ingle per&s;on.&mdash;Now upon the whole, nothing can be plainer than that affections which don't ari&s;e from a virtuous principle, and have no tendency to true virtue, as their effect, cannot be of the na|ture of true virtue.</P>
<P>FOR the rea&s;ons which have been given, it is undeniably true, that if per&s;ons by any means come to have a benevolent affection limited to a party that is very large, or to the coun|try or nation in general, of which they are a part, or the public community they belong to, tho' it be as large as the Roman empire was of old, yea, if there could be an in&s;tinct or other cau&s;e determining a per&s;on to benevolence towards the whole world of mankind, or even all created &s;en&s;ible natures throughout the univer&s;e, exclu&s;ive of union of heart to general exi&s;tence and of love to God, nor derived from that temper of mind which di&s;po&s;es to a &s;upreme re|gard to him, nor &s;ubordinate to &s;uch divine love, it cannot be of the nature of true virtue.</P>
<P>IF what is called natural affection, ari&s;es from a particu|lar natural in&s;tinct, &s;o, much more indi&s;putably, does that mutual affection which naturally ari&s;es between the &s;exes. I agree with <HI>Hutche&s;on</HI> and <HI>Hume</HI> in this, that there is a foundation laid in nature for kind affections between the &s;exes, that are truly diver&s;e from all inclinations to &s;en&s;itive plea&s;ure, and don't properly ari&s;e from any &s;uch inclinati|on. There is doubtle&s;s a di&s;po&s;ition both to a mutual be|nevolence and mutual complacence, that are not naturally and nece&s;&s;arily connected with any &s;en&s;itive de&s;ires. But yet 'tis manife&s;t &s;uch affections as are limited to oppo&s;ite &s;exes, are from a particular in&s;tinct, thus directing &amp; limiting them; and not ari&s;ing from a principle of general benevolence; for this has no tendency to any &s;uch limitation. And tho' the&s;e affections don't properly ari&s;e from the &s;en&s;itive de|&s;ires
<PB N="172" REF="009962_0178_0F7B3D9BAE45BBD0">
which are between the &s;exes, yet they are implanted by the author of nature chiefly for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, viz. the pre&s;ervation or continuation of the world of mankind, to make per&s;ons willing to for&s;ake father and mother, and all their natural relations in the families where they were born and brought up, for the &s;ake of a &s;tated union with a companion of the other &s;ex, and to di&s;po&s;e to that union in bearing and going through with that &s;eries of labours, anxieties, and pains requi&s;ite to the Being, &s;upport and e|ducation of a family of children. Tho' not only for the&s;e ends, but partly al&s;o for the comfort of mankind as united in a marriage-relation.&mdash;But I &s;uppo&s;e, few (if any) will deny, that the peculiar natural di&s;po&s;itions there are to mu|tual affection between the &s;exes, ari&s;e from an in&s;tinct or particular law of nature. And therefore it is manife&s;t from what has been &s;aid already, that tho&s;e natural di&s;po&s;itions cannot be of the nature of true virtue.</P>
<P>ANOTHER affection which is owing to a particular in|&s;tinct, implanted in men for like purpo&s;es with other in|&s;tincts, is that pity which is natural to mankind, when they &s;ee others in great di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;'Tis acknowledged, that &s;uch an affection is natural to mankind. But I think it e|vident, that the pity which is general and natural, is owing to a particular in&s;tinct, and is not of the nature of true vir|tue. I am far from &s;aying, that there is no &s;uch thing as a truly virtuous pity among mankind. For I am far from thinking, that all the pity or mercy which is any where to be found among them, ari&s;es meerly from natural in&s;tinct, or, that none is to be found, which ari&s;es from that truly virtuous divine principle of general benevolence to &s;en&s;itive Beings. Yet at the &s;ame time I think, this is not the ca&s;e with all pity, or with that di&s;po&s;ition to pity which is natu|ral to mankind in common. I think I may be bold to &s;ay, this does not ari&s;e from general benevolence, nor is truly of the nature of benevolence, or properly called by that name.</P>
<P>IF all that unea&s;ine&s;s on the &s;ight of others extreme di&s;|tre&s;s, which we call pity, were properly of the nature of benevolence, then they who are the &s;ubjects of this pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t needs be in a degree of unea&s;ine&s;s in being &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="173" REF="009962_0179_0F7B3D9C59A3EB48">
the total want of happine&s;s, of all &s;uch as they would be di&s;po&s;ed to pity in extreme di&s;tre&s;s. For that certainly is the mo&s;t direct tendency and operation of benevolence or good-will, to de&s;ire the happine&s;s of its object. But now this is not the ca&s;e univer&s;ally, where men are di&s;po&s;ed to exerci&s;e pity. There are many men, with whom that is the ca&s;e in re&s;pect to &s;ome others in the world, that it would not be the occa&s;ion of their being &s;en&s;ibly affected with any unea&s;ine&s;s, to know they were dead (yea men who are not influenced by the con&s;ideration of a future &s;tate, but view death as only a ce&s;&s;ation of all &s;en&s;ibility, and con&s;e|quently an end of all happine&s;s) who yet would have been moved with pity towards the &s;ame per&s;ons, if they had &s;een them under &s;ome very extreme angui&s;h.&mdash;Some men would be moved with pity by &s;eeing a brute-creature under extreme and long torments, who yet &s;uffer no unea&s;ine&s;s in knowing that many thou&s;ands of them every day cea&s;e to live, and &s;o have an end put to all their plea&s;ure, at butch|ers &s;hambles in great cities.&mdash;'Tis the nature of true be|nevolence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o de&s;ire and rejoice in the pro&s;perity and plea|&s;ure of the object of it; and that, in &s;ome-proportion to its degree of prevalence. But per&s;ons may greatly pity tho&s;e that are in extreme pain,, who&s;e po&s;itive plea&s;ure they may &s;till be very indifferent about. In this ca&s;e, a man may be much moved and affected with unea&s;ine&s;s, who yet would be affected with no &s;en&s;ible joy in &s;eeing &s;igns of the &s;ame per&s;on's or Being's enjoyment of very high degrees of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>YEA, pity may not only be without benevolence, but may con&s;i&s;t with true malevolence, or with &s;uch ill-will as &s;hall cau&s;e men not only not to de&s;ire the po&s;itive happine&s;s of another, but even to de&s;ire his calamity. They may pity &s;uch an one when his calamity goes beyond their hatred. A man may have true malevolence towards another, de&s;ir|ing no po&s;itive good for him, but evil: and yet his hatred not be infinite, but only to a certain degree. And when he &s;ees the per&s;on whom he thus hates, in mi&s;ery far be|yond his ill-will, he may then pity him: becau&s;e then the natural in&s;tinct begins to operate. For malevolence will not overcome the natural in&s;tinct, inclining to pity others in extreme calamity, any further than it goes, or to the
<PB N="174" REF="009962_0180_0F7B3D9D06423410">
limits of the degree of mi&s;ery it wi&s;hes to its object. Men may pity others under exqui&s;ite torment, when yet they would have been grieved if they had &s;een their pro&s;perity. And &s;ome men have &s;uch a grudge again&s;t one or another, that they would be far from being unea&s;y at their very death, nay, would even be glad of it. And when this is the ca&s;e with them, 'tis manife&s;t that their heart is void of benevolence towards &s;uch per&s;ons, and under the power of malevolence. Yet at the &s;ame time they are capable of pitying even the&s;e very per&s;ons, if they &s;hould &s;ee them under a degree of mi&s;ery very much di&s;proportioned to their ill-will.</P>
<P>THESE things may convince us that natural pity is of a nature very different from true virtue, and not ari&s;ing from a di&s;po&s;ition of heart to general benevolence: but is owing to a particular in&s;tinct, which the creator has implanted in mankind, for the &s;ame purpo&s;es as mo&s;t other in&s;tincts, <HI>viz.</HI> chiefly for the pre&s;ervation of mankind, though not exclu&s;ive of their well-being. The giving of this in&s;tinct is the fruit of God's mercy, and an in&s;tance of his love of the world of mankind, &amp; an evidence that though the world be &s;o &s;inful, 'tis not God's de&s;ign to make it a world of puni&s;hment: and therefore has many ways made a merciful provi&s;ion for men's relief in extreme calamities: and among others has given mankind in general a di&s;po&s;ition to pity; the natural exerci&s;es whereof extend beyond tho&s;e whom we are in a near con|nection with, e&s;pecially in ca&s;e of great calamity; becau&s;e commonly in &s;uch ca&s;es men &s;tand in need of the help of others be&s;ide their near friends, and becau&s;e commonly tho&s;e calamities which are extreme, without releif, tend to men's de&s;truction. This may be given as the rea&s;on why men are &s;o made by the author of nature, that they have no in&s;tinct inclining as much to rejoice at the &s;ight of others great pro&s;perity and plea&s;ure, as to be grieved at their ex|treme calamity, <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e they don't &s;tand in equal nece&s;&s;i|ty of &s;uch an in&s;tinct as that in order to their pre&s;ervation. But if pure benevolence were the &s;ource of natural pity, doubtle&s;s it would operate to as great a degree in congra|tulation, in ca&s;es of others great pro&s;perity, as in compa&s;&s;ion towards them in great mi&s;ery.</P>

THE in&s;tincts God has given to mankind in this world, which in &s;ome re&s;pects re&s;emble a virtuous benevolence, are agreable to the &s;tate that God de&s;igned mankind for here, where he intends their pre&s;ervation, and comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But in the world of puni&s;hment, where the &s;tate of the wicked inhabitants will be exceeding different, and God will have none of the&s;e merciful de&s;igns to an&s;wer, there, we have great rea&s;on to think, will be no &s;uch thing as a di&s;po&s;ition to pity, in any ca&s;e; as al&s;o there will be no natural affection toward near relations, and no mutual affection between oppo&s;ite &s;exes.</P>
<P>To conclude what I have to &s;ay on the natural in&s;tinct di&s;po&s;ing men to pity others in mi&s;ery, I would ob&s;erve, that this is a &s;ource of a kind of abhorrence in men of &s;ome vices, as cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion; and &s;o, of a &s;ort of appro|bation of the contrary virtues, hamanity, mercy, &amp;c.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The rea&s;ons why tho&s;e things that have been mentioned, which have not the e&s;&s;ence of vir|tue, have yet by many been mi&s;taken for true virtue.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t rea&s;on that may be given of this, is, that altho' they have not the &s;pecific and di&s;tingui&s;hing na|ture and e&s;&s;ence of virtue, yet they have &s;omething that <HI>belongs to the general nature</HI> of virtue.&mdash;The general na|ture of true virtue is love. It is expre&s;&s;ed both in love of benevolence and complacence; but primarily in benevo|lence to per&s;ons and Beings, and con&s;equently and &s;econ|darily in complacence in virtue,&mdash;as has been &s;hewn. There is &s;omething of the general nature of virtue in tho&s;e natural affections and principles that have been mentioned, in both tho&s;e re&s;pects.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="009962_0182_0F7B3D9E792E07F0">
IN many of the&s;e natural affections there is &s;omething of the appearance of love to per&s;ons. In &s;ome of them there appears the tendency and effect of benevolence, in part. Others have truly a &s;ort of benevolence in them, tho' it be a private benevolence, and in &s;everal re&s;pects falls &s;hort of the extent of true virtuous benevolence, both in its nature and object.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t mentioned pa&s;&s;ion, natural to mankind in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, <HI>viz.</HI> that of pity to others in di&s;tre&s;s, tho' not properly of the nature of love, as has been demon&s;trated, yet has partly the &s;ame influence and effect with benevo|lence. One effect of true benevolence is to cau&s;e per&s;ons to be unea&s;y, when the objects of it are in di&s;tre&s;s, and to de&s;ire their relief. And natural pity has the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>NATURAL gratitude, tho' in every in&s;tance wherein it appears it is not properly called love, becau&s;e per&s;ons may be moved with a degree of gratitude towards per&s;ons on certain occa&s;ions, whom they have no real and proper friend&s;hip for, as in the in&s;tance of <HI>Saul</HI> towards <HI>David,</HI> once and again, after <HI>David's</HI> &s;paring his life, when he had &s;o fair opportunity to kill him: yet it has the &s;ame or like operation and effect with friend&s;hip, in part, for a &s;ea&s;on, and with regard to &s;o much of the welfare of its object, as appears a de&s;erved requital of kindne&s;s received. And in other in&s;tances it may have a more general and abiding in|fluence, &s;o as more properly to be called by the name of love. So that many times men from natural gratitude do really with a &s;ort of benevolence love tho&s;e who love them. From this, together with &s;ome other natural principles, men may love their near friends, love their own party, love their country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE natural di&s;po&s;ition their is to mutual affection be|tweeen the &s;exes, often operates by what may properly be called love. There is often times truly a kind both of be|nevolence and complacence. As there al&s;o is between pa|rents and children.</P>
<P>THUS the&s;e things have &s;omething of the general na|ture of virtue, which is love: and e&s;pecially the thing la&s;t
<PB N="177" REF="009962_0183_0F7B3D9F51BB1FA0">
mentioned have &s;omething of a love of benevolence. What they are e&s;&s;entially defective in, is, that they are private in their nature, they don't ari&s;e from any temper of bene|volence to Being in general, nor have they a tendency to any &s;uch effect in their operation. But yet agreeing with virtue in its general nature, they are beautiful within their own private &s;phere: i. e. they appear beautiful if we con|fine our views to that private &s;y&s;tem, and while we &s;hut all other things they &s;tand in any relation to, out of our con|&s;ideration. If that private &s;y&s;tem contain'd the &s;um of uni|ver&s;al exi&s;tence, then their benevolence would have true beauty; or, in other words, would be beautiful, all things con&s;idered: but now it is not &s;o. The&s;e private &s;y&s;tems are &s;o far from containing the &s;um of univer&s;al Being, or comprehending all exi&s;tence which we &s;tand related to, that it contains but an infinitely &s;mall part of it. The rea&s;on why men are &s;o ready to take the&s;e private affections for true virtue, is the narrowne&s;s of their views; and above all, that they are &s;o ready to leave the divine Being out of their view, and to neglect him in their con&s;ideration, or to regard him in their thoughts as tho' he were not properly belong|ing to the &s;y&s;tem of real exi&s;tence, but as a kind of &s;hadowy, imaginary Being, And tho' mo&s;t men allow that there is a God, yet in their ordinary view of things, his Being is not apt to come into the account, and to have the influence and effect of a real exi&s;tence, as 'tis with other Beings which they &s;ee, and are conver&s;ant with by their external &s;en&s;es. In their views of beauty and deformity, and in the inward &s;en&s;ations of di&s;plicence and approbation which ri&s;e in their minds, 'tis not a thing natural to them to be under the influence of a view of the Deity, as part of the &s;y&s;tem, and as the head of the &s;y&s;tem, and he who is all in all, in compari&s;on of whom all the re&s;t is nothing, and with regard to whom all other things are to be viewed, and their minds to be ac|cordingly impre&s;s'd and affected.</P>
<P>YEA, we are apt thro' the narrowne&s;s of our views, in judging of the beauty of affections and actions to limit our con&s;ideration to only a &s;mall part of the created &s;y&s;tem. When private affections extend them&s;elves to a con&s;iderable number, we are very ready to look upon them as truly virtuous, and accordingly to applaud them highly.
<PB N="178" REF="009962_0184_0F7B3DA0E484DC98">
Thus it is with re&s;pect to love to a large party, or a man's love to his country. For tho' his private &s;y&s;tem contains but a &s;mall part even of the world of mankind, yet being a con&s;iderable number, thro' the contracted limits of the mind and the narrowne&s;s of his views, they are ready to fill his mind and engro&s;s his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, and to &s;eem as if they were all. Hence among the <HI>Romans</HI> love to their country was the highe&s;t vir|tue: tho' this affection of theirs, &s;o much extolled among them, was employ'd as it were for the de&s;truction of the re&s;t of the world of mankind.&mdash;The larger the number is, that private affection extends to, the more apt men are, thro' the narrowne&s;s of their &s;ight, to mi&s;take it for true virtue; be|cau&s;e then the private &s;y&s;tem appears to have more of the image of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem. Whereas, when the circle it extends to, is very &s;mall, it is not &s;o apt to be look'd upon virtuous, or not &s;o virtuous. As, a man's love to his own children.&mdash;</P>
<P>AND this is the rea&s;on why &s;elf-love is by nobody mi&s;ta|ken for true virtue. For tho' there be &s;omething of the ge|neral nature of virtue in this, here is love and good-will, yet the object is &s;o private, the limits &s;o narrow, that it by no means engro&s;&s;es the view; unle&s;s it be of the per&s;on him&s;elf, who thro' the greatne&s;s of his pride may imagine him&s;elf as it were <HI>all.</HI> The minds of men are large enough to take in a va&s;tly greater extent: and tho' &s;elf-love is far from being u&s;ele&s;s in the world, yea, 'tis exceeding nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ociety, be&s;ides its directly and greatly &s;eeking the good of one, yet every body &s;ees that if it be not &s;ubordinate to, and regulated by, another more exten&s;ive principle, it may make a man a common enemy to the &s;y&s;tem he is related to. And tho' this is as true of any other private affection, notwith&s;tanding its extent may be to a &s;y&s;tem that contains thou&s;ands of in|dividuals, and tho&s;e private &s;y&s;tems bear no greater propor|tion to the whole of univer&s;al exi&s;tence, than one alone, yet they bear a greater proportion to the extent to the view and comprehen&s;ion of men's minds, and are more apt to be re|garded as if they were <HI>all,</HI> or at lea&s;t as &s;ome re&s;emblance of the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Thus I have ob&s;erved how many of the&s;e natural princi|ples, which have been &s;poken of, re&s;emble virtue in its pri|mary operation, which is benevolence. Many of them
<PB N="179" REF="009962_0185_0F7B3DA179EF8330">
al&s;o have a re&s;emblance of it in its &s;econdary operation, which is its approbation of and complacence in virtue it&s;elf. Several kinds of approbation of virtue have been taken no|tice of, as common to mankind, which are not of the nature of a truly virtuous approbation, con&s;i&s;ting in a &s;en&s;e and re|li&s;h of the e&s;&s;ential beauty of virtue, con&s;i&s;ting in a Being's cordial union to Being in general, from a &s;pirit of love to Being in general. As particularly, the approbation of con&s;cience, from a &s;en&s;e of the inferior and &s;econ|dary beauty which there is in virtue, con&s;i&s;ting in uni|formity, and from a &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert, con&s;i&s;ting in a &s;en&s;e of the natural agreement of loving and being beloved, &s;hewing kindne&s;s and receiving kindne&s;s. So from the &s;ame prin|ciple, there is a di&s;approbation of vice, from a natural op|po&s;ition to deformity and di&s;proportion, and a &s;en&s;e of evil de&s;ert, or the natural agreement there is between hating and being hated, oppo&s;ing and being oppo&s;ed, &amp;c. together with a painful &s;en&s;ation naturally ari&s;ing in a &s;en&s;e of &s;elf-oppo|&s;ition and incon&s;i&s;tence.&mdash;Approbation of con&s;cience is the more readily mi&s;taken for a truly virtuous approbation, becau&s;e by the wi&s;e con&s;titution of the great governor of the world (as was ob&s;erved) when con&s;cience is well informed, and thoroughly awakened, it agrees with the latter fully and exactly, as to the object approved, tho' not as to the ground and rea&s;on of approving. It approves all virtue, and con|demns all vice. It approves true virtue, and indeed approves nothing that is again&s;t it, or that falls &s;hort of it; as was &s;hewn before. And indeed natural con&s;cience is implanted in all mankind, there to be as it were in God's &s;tead, and to be an internal judge or rule to all, whereby to di&s;tingui&s;h right and wrong.</P>
<P>IT has al&s;o been ob&s;erved, how that virtue, con&s;i&s;ting in benevolence, is approved, and vice, con&s;i&s;ting in ill-will, is di&s;liked, from the influence of &s;elf-love, together with a&s;&s;o|ciation of ideas, in the &s;ame manner as men di&s;like tho&s;e qualities in things without life or rea&s;on, with which they have always connected the ideas of hurtfulne&s;s, malignancy, perniciou&s;ne&s;s; but like tho&s;e things with which they ha|bitually connect the ideas of profit, plea&s;antne&s;s, com|fortablene&s;s, &amp;c. This &s;ort of approbation or liking of vir|tue, and di&s;like of vice, is ea&s;ily mi&s;taken for true virtue, not only becau&s;e tho&s;e things are approved by it that have the
<PB N="180" REF="009962_0186_0F7B3DA3E7FF2A90">
nature of virtue, and the things di&s;liked have the nature of vice, but becau&s;e here is much of re&s;emblance of virtuous approbation, it being complacence from love; the differ|ence only lying in this, that it is not from love to Being in general, but from &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o, as has been &s;hewn, a liking of &s;ome vir|tues, and di&s;like of &s;ome vices, from the influence of the natural in&s;tinct of pity. This men are apt to mi&s;take for the exerci&s;e of true virtue, on many accounts. Here is not only a kind of complacence, and the objects of complacence are what have the nature of virtue, and the virtues indeed very amiable, &s;uch as humanity, mercy, tenderne&s;s of heart, &amp;c. and the contrary very odious; but be&s;ides, the appro|bation is not meerly from &s;elf-love, but from compa&s;&s;ion, an affection that re&s;pects others, and re&s;embles benevolence, as has been &s;hewn.</P>
<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on, why the things which have been men|tioned, are mi&s;taken for true virtue, is, that there is indeed a true <HI>negative</HI> moral goodne&s;s in them. By a negative mo|ral goodne&s;s, I mean the negation or ab&s;ence of true moral evil. They have this negative moral goodne&s;s, becau&s;e a being without them would be an evidence of a much grea|ter moral evil. Thus, the exerci&s;e of natural con&s;cience in &s;uch and &s;uch degrees, wherein appears &s;uch a mea&s;ure of an awakening or &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience, tho' it be not of the nature of real po&s;itive virtue or true moral goodne&s;s, yet has a negative moral goodne&s;s; becau&s;e in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, it is an evidence of the ab&s;ence of that higher de|gree of wickedne&s;s, which cau&s;es great in&s;en&s;ibility or &s;tupi|dity of con&s;cience. For &s;in, as was ob&s;erved, is not only again&s;t a &s;piritual and divine &s;en&s;e of virtue, but is al&s;o a|gain&s;t the dictates of that moral &s;en&s;e which is in natural con&s;cience. No wonder, that this &s;en&s;e being long oppo&s;ed and often conquered, grows weaker. All &s;in has its &s;ource from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or from &s;elf-love, not &s;ubordinate to regard to Being in general. And natural con&s;cience chiefly con|&s;i&s;ts in a &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert, or the natural agreement between &s;in and mi&s;ery. But if &s;elf were indeed <HI>all,</HI> and &s;o more con&s;iderable than all the world be&s;ides, there would be no ill de&s;ert in his regarding him&s;elf above all, and making all
<PB N="181" REF="009962_0187_0F7B3DA48F98CC40">
other intere&s;ts give place to private intere&s;t.&mdash;And no won|der that men by long acting from the &s;elfi&s;h principle, and by being habituated to treat them&s;elves as if they were <HI>all,</HI> increa&s;e in pride, and come as it were naturally to look on them&s;elves as <HI>all,</HI> and &s;o to lo&s;e entirely the &s;en&s;e of ill de|&s;ert in their making all other intere&s;ts give place to their own.&mdash;And no wonder that men by often repeating acts of &s;in, without puni&s;hment, or any vi&s;ible appearance of ap|proaching puni&s;hment, have le&s;s and le&s;s &s;en&s;e of the con|nection of &s;in with puni&s;hment. That &s;en&s;e which an a|wakned con&s;cience has of the de&s;ert of &s;in, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in a &s;en&s;e of its de&s;ert of re&s;entment of the Deity, the foun|tain and head of univer&s;al exi&s;tence. But no wonder that by a long continued worldly and &s;en&s;ual life, men more and more lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of the Deity, who is a &s;piritual and invi&s;ible Being. The mind being long involved in, and en|gro&s;s'd by &s;en&s;itive objects, becomes &s;en&s;ual in all its opera|tions, and excludes all views and impre&s;&s;ions of &s;piritual objects, and is unfit for their contemplation. Thus the con&s;cience and general benevolence are entirely different principles, &amp; &s;en&s;e of con&s;cience differs from the holy com|placence of a benevolent and truly virtuous heart. Yet wickedne&s;s may by long habitual exerci&s;e greatly dimini&s;h a &s;en&s;e of con&s;cience. So that there may be negative mo|ral goodne&s;s, in &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience, as it may be an ar|gument of the ab&s;ence of that higher degree of wickedne&s;s, which cau&s;eth &s;tupidity of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>So with re&s;pect to natural <HI>gratitude,</HI> tho' there may be no virtue meerly in loving them that love us, yet the contrary may be an evidence of a great degree of depravity, as it may argue a higher degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;o that a man is come to look upon him&s;elf as all, and others as nothing, and &s;o their re&s;pect and kindne&s;s as nothing. Thus an increa&s;e of pride dimini&s;hes gratitude.&mdash;So does &s;en&s;uality, or the increa&s;e of &s;en&s;ual appetites, &amp; coming more and more under the power and impre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ible objects, tends by de|grees to make the mind in&s;en&s;ible to any thing el&s;e; and tho&s;e appetites take up the whole &s;oul; and thro' habit and cu&s;tom the water is all drawn out of other channels, in which it naturally flows, and is all carried as it were into one channel.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="009962_0188_0F7B3DA54099C730">
IN like manner natural affection, and natural pity, tho' not of the nature of virtue, yet may be dimini&s;hed greatly by the increa&s;e of tho&s;e two principles of pride and &s;en&s;ua|lity, and as the con&s;equence of this, being habitually di&s;|po&s;ed to envy, malice, &amp;c. The&s;e lu&s;ts when they prevail to a high degree may overcome and dimini&s;h the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e natural principles: even as they often overcome and dimini&s;h common prudence in a man, as to &s;eeking his own private intere&s;t, in point of health, wealth, or honor, and yet no one will think it proves that a man's being cunning, in &s;eeking his own per&s;onal and temporal intere&s;t has any thing of the nature and e&s;&s;ence of true virtue.</P>
<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on why the&s;e natural principles and af|fections are mi&s;taken for true virtue, is, that in &s;everal re|&s;pects they have the &s;ame effect, which true virtue tends to; e&s;pecially in the&s;e two ways&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. THE pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world is &s;o ordered and con|&s;tituted by the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of its &s;upreme ruler, that the&s;e natural principles for the mo&s;t part tend to the good of the world of mankind. So do natural pity, gra|titude, parental affection, &amp;c. Herein they agree with the tendency of general benevolence, which &s;eeks &amp; tends to the general good. But this is no proof that the&s;e natural prin|ciples have the nature of true virtue. For &s;elf-love is a principle that is exceeding u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary in the world of mankind. So are the natural appetites of hunger and thir&s;t &amp;c. But yet nobody will a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e have the nature of true virtue.</P>
<P N="2">2. THESE principles have a like effect with true virtue in this re&s;pect, that they tend &s;everal ways to re&s;train vice, and prevent many acts of wickedne&s;s.&mdash;So, natural af|fection, love to our party, or to particular friends, tends to keep us from acts of inju&s;tice towards the&s;e per&s;ons; which would be real wickedne&s;s&mdash;Pity pre&s;erves from cruelty, which would be real and great moral evil.&mdash;Natu|ral con&s;cience tends to re&s;train &s;in in general, in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of the world.&mdash;But neither can this prove the&s;e principles them&s;elves to be of the nature of true virtue. For &s;o is this pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind ordered by a mer|ciful
<PB N="183" REF="009962_0189_0F7B3DA610C3FE00">
God, that men's &s;elf-love does in innumerable re|&s;pects re&s;train from acts of true wickedne&s;s; and not only &s;o, but puts men upon &s;eeking true virtue: yet is not it&s;elf true virtue, but is the &s;ource of all the wickedne&s;s that is in the world.</P>
<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on why the&s;e inferior affections e&s;pecially &s;ome of them, are accounted virtuous, is, that there are af|fections of the &s;ame denomination, which are truly virtuous. Thus, for in&s;tance, there is a truly virtuous <HI>pity,</HI> or a com|pa&s;&s;ion to others under affliction or mi&s;ery from general be|nevolence. Pure benevolence would be &s;ufficient to excite pity to another in calamity, if there were no particular in|&s;tinct, or any other principle determining the mind thereto. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee how benevolence, which &s;eeks another's good &s;hould cau&s;e us to de&s;ire his deliverance from evil. And this is a &s;ource of pity far more exten&s;ive than the other. It excites compa&s;&s;ion in ca&s;es that are overlook'd by natural in&s;tinct. And even in tho&s;e ca&s;es to which in&s;tinct extends, it mixes its influence with the natural principle, and guides and regulates its operations. And when this is the ca&s;e, the pity which is exerci&s;ed, may be called a virtuous compa&s;&s;i|on.&mdash;So there is a virtuous <HI>gratitude,</HI> or a gratitude that ari&s;es not only from &s;elf-love, but from a &s;uperior principle of di&s;intere&s;ted general benevolence. As 'tis manife&s;t, that when we receive kindne&s;s from &s;uch as we love already, we are more di&s;po&s;ed to gratitude, and di&s;po&s;ed to greater de|grees of it, than when the mind is de&s;titute of any &s;uch friendly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Therefore, when the &s;uperior prin|ciple of virtuous love has a governing hand, and regulates the affair, it may be called a virtuous gratitude.&mdash;So there is a virtuous love of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> ari&s;ing from pure benevolence to Being in general, as that naturally and nece&s;&s;arily inclines the heart, that every particular Being &s;hould have &s;uch a &s;hare of benevolence as is proportioned to its dignity, con|&s;i&s;ting in the degree of its Being, and the degree of its vir|tue. Which is intirely diver&s;e from an apprehen&s;ion of ju&s;tice, from a &s;en&s;e of the beauty of uniformity in variety: as has been particularly &s;hewn already. And &s;o it is ea&s;y to &s;ee how there may be a virtuous &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert different from what is natural and common. And &s;o a virtuous <HI>con|&s;cienciou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> or a &s;anctified con&s;cience.&mdash;And as when <HI>na|tural
<PB N="184" REF="009962_0190_0F7B3DA6CB911EE0">
affections</HI> have their operations mixed with the influence of virtuous benevolence, and are directed and determined hereby, they may be called virtuous, &s;o there may be a virtuous love of parents to children, and between other near relatives, a virtuous love of our town, or country, or nation. Yea, and a virtuous love between the &s;exes, as there may be the influence of virtue mingled with in&s;tinct, and virtue may govern with regard to the particular manner of its ope|ration, and may guide it to &s;uch ends as are agreable to the great ends and purpo&s;es of true virtue.</P>
<P>GENUINE virtue prevents that increa&s;e of the habits of pride and &s;en&s;uality, which tend to over-bear and greatly dimini&s;h the exerci&s;es of the forementioned u&s;eful and ne|ce&s;&s;ary principles of nature. And a principle of general benevolence &s;oftens and &s;weetens the mind, and makes it more &s;u&s;ceptible of the proper influence and exerci&s;e of the gentler natural in&s;tincts, and directs every one into its pro|per channel, and determines the exerci&s;e to the proper man|ner and mea&s;ure, and guides all to the be&s;t purpo&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In what re&s;pects virtue or moral good is founded in &s;entiment; and how far it is founded in the rea&s;on and nature of things.</HEAD>
<P>THAT which is called <HI>virtue,</HI> is a certain kind of beau|tiful nature, form or quality that is ob&s;erved in things. That form or quality is called <HI>beautiful</HI> to any one behold|ing it to whom it is beautiful, which appears in it&s;elf agre|able or comely to him, or the view or idea of which is im|mediately plea&s;ant to the mind. I &s;ay, agreable <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> and <HI>immediately</HI> plea&s;ant, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from things which in them&s;elves are not agreable nor plea&s;ant, but either indiffe|rent or di&s;agreable, which yet appear eligible and agreable indirectly for &s;omething el&s;e that is the con&s;equence of them, or with which they are connected. Such a kind of indirect agreablene&s;s or eligiblene&s;s in things, not for them&s;elves, but
<PB N="185" REF="009962_0191_0F7B3DA88AE99828">
for &s;ome thing el&s;e, is not what is called beauty. But when a form or quality appears lovely, plea&s;ing and delight|ful in it&s;elf, then it is called beautiful; and this agreablene&s;s or gratefulne&s;s of the idea is what is called beauty. It is evident therefore by this, that the way we come by the idea or &s;en&s;ation or beauty, is by immediate &s;en&s;ation of the gratefulne&s;s of the idea called <HI>beautiful;</HI> and not by finding out by argumentation any con&s;equences, or other things that it &s;tands connected with; any more than ta&s;ting the &s;weet|ne&s;s of honey, or perceiving the harmony of a tune, is by argumentation on connections and con&s;equences. And this manner of being affected with the immediate pre&s;ence of the beautiful idea depends not, therefore, on any rea&s;onings about the idea, after we have it, before we can find out whether it be beautiful, or not; but on the frame of our minds, whereby they are &s;o made that &s;uch an idea, as &s;oon as we have it, is grateful, or appears beautiful.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, if this be all that is meant by them who affirm, virtue is founded in &s;entiment and not in rea&s;on, that they who &s;ee the beauty there is in true virtue, don't per|ceive it by argumentation on its connexions and con&s;equen|ces, but by the frame of their own minds, or a certain &s;pi|ritual &s;en&s;e given them of God, whereby they immediately perceive plea&s;ure in the pre&s;ence of the idea of true virtue in their minds, or are directly gratified in the view or con|templation of this object, this is certainly true.</P>
<P>BUT if thereby is meant, that the frame of mind, or in|ward &s;en&s;e given them by God, whereby the mind is di&s;po|&s;ed to delight in the idea or view of true virtue, is given ar|bitrarily, &s;o that if he had plea&s;ed he might have given a contrary &s;en&s;e and determination of mind, which would have agreed as well with the nece&s;&s;ary nature of things, this I think is not true.</P>
<P>VIRTUE, as I have ob&s;erved, con&s;i&s;ts in the cordial con&s;ent or union of Being to Being in general. And, as has al&s;o been ob&s;erved, that frame of mind, whereby it is di&s;po&s;ed to re|li&s;h and be plea&s;ed with the view of this, is benevolence or union of heart it&s;elf to Being in general, or a univer&s;ally benevolent frame of mind: becau&s;e he who&s;e temper is to
<PB N="186" REF="009962_0192_0F7B3DA9607C40F0">
love Being in general, therein mu&s;t have a di&s;po&s;ition to approve and be plea&s;ed with love to Being in general. Therefore now the que&s;tion is, whether God in giving this temper to a created mind, whereby it unites to or loves Be|ing in general, acts &s;o arbitrarily, that there is nothing in the nece&s;&s;ary nature of things to hinder but that a contrary temper might have agreed or con&s;i&s;ted as well with that nature of things, as this?</P>
<P>AND in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place I ob&s;erve, that to a&s;&s;ert this, would be a plain ab&s;urdity, and contrary to the very &s;uppo&s;ition. For here 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, that virtue in its very e&s;&s;ence con|&s;i&s;ts in agreement or con&s;ent of Being to Being. Now cer|tainly agreement it&s;elf to Being in general mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily agree better with general exi&s;tence, than oppo&s;ition &amp; con|trariety to it.</P>
<P>I OBSERVE <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that God in giving to the creature &s;uch a temper of mind, gives that which is agreable to what is by ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity his own temper and nature. For, as has been often ob&s;erved, God him&s;elf is in effect&punc; Being in general; and without all doubt it is in it&s;elf ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, that God &s;hould agree with him&s;elf, be united with him&s;elf, or love him&s;elf: and therefore, when he gives the &s;ame temper to his creatures, this is more agreable to his nece&s;&s;ary nature, than the oppo&s;ite temper: yea, the latter would be infi|nitely contrary to his nature.</P>
<P>LET it be noted, <HI>thirdly,</HI> by this temper only can created Beings be united to, and agree with one another. This appears, becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts in con&s;ent and union to Being in general; which implies agreement and union with every particular Being, except &s;uch as are oppo&s;ite to Being in general, or excepting &s;uch ca&s;es wherein union with them is by &s;ome means incon&s;i&s;tent with union with general ex|i&s;tence. But certainly if any particular created Being were of a temper to oppo&s;e Being in general, that would infer the mo&s;t univer&s;al and greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;cord, not only of creatures with their creator, but of created Beings one with another.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="009962_0193_0F7B3DA9C37C6138">
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> I OBSERVE, there is no other temper but this, that a man can have, and agree with him&s;elf, or be without &s;elf-incon&s;i&s;tence, i. e. without having &s;ome inclinations and reli&s;hes repugnant to others. And that for the&s;e rea|&s;ons. Every Being that has under&s;tanding and will, nece&s;|&s;arily loves happine&s;s. For, to &s;uppo&s;e any Being not to love happine&s;s, would be to &s;uppo&s;e he did not love what was agreable to him; which is a contradiction: or at lea&s;t would imply, that nothing was agreable or eligible to him, which is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that he has no &s;uch thing as choice, or any faculty of will. So that every Being who has a faculty of will, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have an inclination to happine&s;s. And therefore, if he be con&s;i&s;tent with him|&s;elf, and has not &s;ome inclinations repugnant to others, he mu&s;t approve of tho&s;e inclinations whereby Beings de&s;ire the happine&s;s of Being in general, and mu&s;t be again&s;t a di&s;po&s;ition to the mi&s;ery of Being in general: becau&s;e o|therwi&s;e he would approve of oppo&s;ition to his own happi|ne&s;s. For, if a temper inclined to the mi&s;ery of Being in general prevailed univer&s;ally, 'tis apparent, it would tend to univer&s;al mi&s;ery. But he that loves a tendency to univer|&s;al mi&s;ery, in effect loves a tendency to his own mi&s;ery: and as he nece&s;&s;arily hates his own mi&s;ery, he has then one in|clination repugnant to another.&mdash;And be&s;ides, it nece&s;&s;arily follows from &s;elf-love, that men love to be loved by others; becau&s;e in this others love agrees with their own love. But if men loved hatred to Being in general, they would in ef|fect love the hatred of them&s;elves: and &s;o would be incon|&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, having one natural inclination con|trary to another.</P>
<P>THESE things may help us to under&s;tand why that &s;pi|ritual and divine &s;en&s;e, by which tho&s;e that are truly virtu|ous and holy, perceive the excellency of true virtue, is in the &s;acred &s;criptures called by the name of light, knowledge, under&s;tanding, &amp;c. If this divine &s;en&s;e were a thing arbi|trarily given, without any foundation in the nature of things, it would not properly be called by &s;uch names. For, if there were no corre&s;pondence or agreement in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e with the nature of things, any more than there would have been in a diver&s;e or contrary &s;en&s;e, the idea we obtain by this &s;piritual &s;en&s;e could in no re&s;pect be &s;aid to be a know|ledge
<PB N="188" REF="009962_0194_0F7B3DAA98E66B90">
or perception of any thing be&s;ides what was in our own minds. For this idea would be no repre&s;entation of any thing without. But &s;ince it is otherwi&s;e, &s;ince it is a|greable, in the re&s;pects abovementioned, to the nature of things and e&s;pecially &s;ince 'tis the repre&s;entation and image of the moral perfection and excellency of the divine Being, hereby we have a perception of that moral excellency, of which we could have no true idea without it. And it be|ing &s;o, hereby per&s;ons have that true knowledge of God, which greatly enlightens the mind in the knowledge of di|vine things in general, and does (as might be &s;hewn, if it were nece&s;&s;ary to the main purpo&s;e of this di&s;cour&s;e) in many re&s;pects a&s;&s;i&s;t per&s;ons to a right under&s;tanding of things in general, to under&s;tand which our faculties were chiefly given us, and which do chiefly concern our intere&s;t; and a&s;&s;i&s;ts us to &s;ee the nature of them, and the truth of them, in their proper evidence. Whereas, the want of this &s;piri|tual &s;en&s;e, and the prevalence of tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions that are contrary to it, tends to darken and di&s;tract the mind, and dreadfully to delude and confound men's under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>AND as to that moral &s;en&s;e, common to mankind, which there is in <HI>natural con&s;cience,</HI> neither can this be truly &s;aid to be no more than a &s;entiment arbitrarily given by the crea|tor, without any relation to the nece&s;&s;ary nature of things: but is e&s;tabli&s;hed in an agreement with the nature of things; &s;o as no &s;en&s;e of mind that can be &s;uppo&s;ed, of a contrary nature and tendency could be. This will appear by the&s;e two things.&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS moral &s;en&s;e, if the under&s;tanding be well in|formed, and be exerci&s;ed at liberty and in an exten&s;ive man|ner, without being re&s;trained to a private &s;phere, approves the very &s;ame things which a &s;piritual and divine &s;en&s;e ap|proves; and tho&s;e things only; though not on the &s;ame grounds, nor with the &s;ame kind of approbation. There|fore, as that divine &s;en&s;e has been already &s;hewn to be a|greable to the nece&s;&s;ary nature of things, &s;o this inferior moral &s;en&s;e, being &s;o far corre&s;pondent to that, mu&s;t al&s;o &s;o far agree with the nature of things.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="189" REF="009962_0195_0F7B3DAB391AB6A0">
2. IT has been &s;hewn, that this moral &s;en&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in approving the uniformity and natural agreement there is between one thing and another. So that by the &s;uppo&s;iti|on it is agreable to the nature of things. For therein it con&s;i&s;ts, viz. a di&s;po&s;ition of mind to con&s;ent to, or like, the agreement of the nature of things, or the agreement of the nature and form of one thing with another. And certain|ly &s;uch a temper of mind as likes the agreement of things to the nature of things, is more agreable to the nature of things than an oppo&s;ite temper of mind.</P>
<P>HERE it may be ob&s;erved&mdash;As the u&s;e of <HI>language</HI> is for mankind to expre&s;s their &s;entiments or ideas to each o|ther, &s;o that tho&s;e terms in language, by which things of a moral nature are &s;ignified, are to expre&s;s tho&s;e moral &s;enti|ments or ideas that are common to mankind; therefore 'tis, that moral &s;en&s;e which is in natural con&s;cience, that chiefly governs the u&s;e of language among mankind, and is the mind's rule of language in the&s;e matters among man|kind; 'tis indeed the general natural rule which God has given to all men, whereby to judge of moral good and evil. By &s;uch words, right and wrong, good and evil, when u&s;ed in a moral &s;en&s;e, is meant in common &s;peech that which de&s;erves prai&s;e or blame, re&s;pect or re&s;entment. But as has been often ob&s;erv'd, mankind in general have a &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert, by this natural moral &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>THEREFORE here may ari&s;e a que&s;tion, which may de|&s;erve to be con&s;idered, viz Seeing it is thus, that &s;entiment among mankind is the rule of language, as to what is called by the name of good and evil, worthy and unworthy; and 'tis apparent, that &s;entiment, at lea&s;t as to many particulars, by &s;ome means or other is different in different per&s;ons, in different nations; that being thought to de&s;erve prai&s;e by one, which by others is thought to be worthy of blame; how therefore can virtue and vice be any other than arbi|trary, not at all determined by the nature of things, but by the &s;entiments of men with relation to the nature of things?</P>
<P>IN order to the an&s;wering this que&s;tion with clearne&s;s, it may be divided into two: viz. Whether men's &s;entiments
<PB N="190" REF="009962_0196_0F7B3DACE89B14A0">
of moral good and evil are not arbitrary, or rather ca&s;ual and accidental? And, whether the way of their u&s;ing words in what they call good and evil, is not arbitrary, without re&s;pect to any common &s;entiment in all, conformed to the nature of things?</P>
<P>As TO the fir&s;t, I would ob&s;erve, that the general di&s;po&s;i|tion or &s;en&s;e of mind exerci&s;ed in a &s;en&s;e of de&s;ert of e&s;teem or re&s;entment, may be the &s;ame in all: though as to parti|cular objects and occa&s;ions with regard to which it is exer|ci&s;ed, it may be very various in different men or bodies of men, through the partiality or error that may attend the view or attention of the mind. In all, a notion of de&s;ert of love, or re&s;entment, may con&s;i&s;t in the &s;ame thing, in general, viz. a &s;uitablene&s;s, or natural uniformity and agree|ment between the affections and acts of the agent, and the affections and treatment of others &s;ome way concerned; or the natural agreement between love (or &s;omething that &s;ome way implies love, or proceeds from it, or tends to it) and love; a natural agreement between treating well, and being well treated; the natural agreement between hating (or &s;omething that &s;ome way partakes of the nature of hatred) and being hated, &amp;c. I &s;ay, this general notion of de&s;ert may be the &s;ame: and yet occa&s;ions and objects through variety of apprehen&s;ions about the&s;e occa&s;ions and objects, and the various manner in which they are viewed, by rea&s;on of the partial attention of the mind, may be extremely various; and example, cu&s;tom, education, and a&s;&s;ociation may have a hand in this, in ways innumerable. But 'tis needle&s;s to dwell long on this, &s;ince things which have been &s;aid by others (Mr. <HI>Hutche&s;on,</HI> in particular) may abundantly &s;hew, that the differences which are to be found among different per&s;ons and nations, concerning moral good and evil, are not incon&s;i&s;tent with a general moral &s;en&s;e, common to all mankind.</P>
<P>NOR, &s;econdly, is the u&s;e of the words, good and evil, right and wrong, when u&s;ed in a moral &s;en&s;e, altogether unfix'd and arbitrary, according to the variety of notions, opinions, and views, that occa&s;ion the forementioned vari|ety of &s;entiment. For tho' the &s;ignification of words is de|termined by u&s;e, yet that which governs in the u&s;e of terms
<PB N="191" REF="009962_0197_0F7B3DAD9A9F7DA0">
is general or common u&s;e. And mankind, in what they would &s;ignify by terms, are obliged to aim at a con&s;i&s;tent u&s;e: becau&s;e it is ea&s;ily found that the end of language, which is to be a common medium of manife&s;ting ideas and &s;entiments, cannot be obtained any other way than by a con&s;i&s;tent u&s;e of words; both that men &s;hould be con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, and one with another, in the u&s;e of them. But men can't call any thing right or wrong, worthy or ill-de&s;erving, con&s;i&s;tently, any other way than by calling things &s;o, which truly de&s;erve prai&s;e or blame, i. e. things, wherein (all things con&s;idered) there is mo&s;t uniformity in connecting with them prai&s;e or blame. There is no other way that they can u&s;e the&s;e terms con&s;i&s;tently with them|&s;elves. Thus, if thieves or traitors may be angry with in|formers, that bring them to ju&s;tice, and call their behavi|our by odious names, yet herein they are incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves; becau&s;e, when they put them&s;elves in the place of tho&s;e that have injured them, they approve the &s;ame things they condemn. And therefore &s;uch are capa|ble of being convinced, that they apply the&s;e odious terms in an abu&s;ive manner. So, a nation that pro&s;ecutes an am|bitious de&s;ign of univer&s;al empire, by &s;ubduing other nati|ons with fire and &s;word, may affix terms that &s;ignify the highe&s;t degrees of virtue, to the conduct of &s;uch as &s;hew the mo&s;t engaged, &s;table, re&s;olute &s;pirit in this affair, and do mo&s;t of this bloody work. But yet they are capable of being convinced, that they u&s;e the&s;e terms incon&s;i&s;tently, and abu&s;e language in it, and &s;o having their mouths &s;top|ped.&mdash;And not only will men u&s;e &s;uch words incon&s;i&s;t|ently with them&s;elves, but al&s;o with one another, by u&s;ing them any otherwi&s;e than to &s;ignify true merit or ill-de&s;erv|ing, as before explained. For there is no way el&s;e, wherein men have any notion of good or ill-de&s;ert, that mankind in general can agree in. Mankind in general &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome general &s;tandard or foundation in nature for an uni|ver&s;al con&s;i&s;tence in the u&s;e of the terms whereby they ex|pre&s;s moral good and evil; which none can depart from but thro' error and mi&s;take. This is evidently &s;uppo&s;ed in all di&s;putes they may have one with another, about right and wrong; and in all endeavors u&s;ed to evince or prove that any thing is either good or evil, in a moral &s;en&s;e.</P>
