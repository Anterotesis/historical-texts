<BIBL>NEHEMIAH IX. 36,&mdash;38.</BIBL>
<Q><P><HI>Behold we are Servants this Day! And for the Land that thou gave&s;t unto our Fathers, to eat the Fruit thereof, and the Good thereof, behold we are Servants in it!</HI></P>
<P><HI>And it yieldeth much Increa&s;e unto the Kings which thou ha&s;t &s;et over us, becau&s;e of our Sins: Al&s;o they have Dominion over our Bodies and over our Cattle, at their Plea&s;ure: And we are in great Di&s;tre&s;s!</HI></P>

<P><HI>NEHEMIAH,</HI> the author of this book, was a great officer in the court of <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> king, or ra|ther, as we now &s;peak, <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> (being his Cup-bearer). Which honorable and profitable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, it &s;eems, tempted him to tarry behind, when
<PB N="6" REF="013758_0004_0F91AAE851E4DF20">
his brethren return'd from captivity, about thir|teen years before, under <HI>Zerubbabel</HI> and <HI>Ezra,</HI> in order to rebuild the temple and city; which had now, according to the prophecy, lain wa&s;te &s;e|venty years.</P>
<P>But when he found, by an account given him by &s;ome of his brethren who had return'd from Judea, the yet de&s;olate condition of his ancient city and country, being a good man and a true <HI>patriot,</HI> he was greatly affected, and pa&s;s'd &s;everal days in <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>tears</HI> and doleful <HI>retirement:</HI> And then addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to God in the mo&s;t <HI>humble prayer</HI> and <HI>&s;upplication</HI> for them.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of which is thus given by a learned paraphra&s;t.</P>
<P>"Lord of heaven and governor of all things! who art infinitely ju&s;t and tremendous in thy judgments upon the di&s;obedient; and faithful to all thy promi&s;es to thy dutiful &s;ervants: Lend a gracious car to the cries of a di&s;tre&s;s'd I&s;raelite, humbly confe&s;&s;ing his own and his father's ini|quities; and lamenting the calamities of his na|tion, thine own cho&s;en people.</P>
<P>Let it &s;uffice that they have thus long felt and &s;marted under the heavy &s;trokes of thy righ|teous di&s;plea&s;ure, and, with all contrition beg again to be re&s;tor'd to thy wonted favor and protection.</P>
<P>Remember how thy earlie&s;t &s;ure threats of puni&s;hing their wickedne&s;s with the lo&s;s of their dear country, were &s;till accompanied with a gra|cious
<PB N="7" REF="013758_0005_0F91AAE8A8FB8808">
promi&s;e, that their repentance &s;hould at la&s;t retrieve it again; and cau&s;e them &s;till to be own'd by thee for thine <HI>inheritance;</HI> for who&s;e &s;akes thou ha&s;t done &s;uch marvellous things in the &s;ight of all nations.</P>
<P>Have mercy upon the multitude of the guilty, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who are truly penitent, and &s;incerely de&s;ire thy true honour and wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Make me the in&s;trument of procuring their &s;afety and taking away their reproach, by ble&s;&s;ing the endeavours I am now going to u&s;e with the Per&s;ian Emperor in their favour."</P>
<P>Here was a <HI>true patriot</HI> indeed! Here was a man who &s;ought the good of his country! and &s;ought it from principle, and in the right way!</P>
<P>Fir&s;t he <HI>mourn'd</HI> for their di&s;tre&s;s; then he <HI>fa&s;ted</HI> and <HI>pray'd,</HI> and be&s;ought the God of Hea|ven to <HI>direct</HI> and pro&s;per him: And then he <HI>u&s;ed</HI> the mo&s;t likely <HI>means</HI> he could think of to procure their relief; which was by u&s;ing his intere&s;t with the <HI>Emperor</HI> to get a commi&s;&s;ion to go him&s;elf and help them.</P>
<P>And God pro&s;per'd him&mdash;He went and re|liev'd them in a mo&s;t wonderful manner!</P>
<P>O how happy for us if we had &s;uch a friend in the Briti&s;h Court, who had &s;uch influence with the King in this evil day! What great things might he, under God, do for us! But alas tho' we have, like the di&s;tre&s;s'd Jews, many enemies, yet we have no &s;uch <HI>powerful friend</HI> to exert him&s;elf in our favour!</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="013758_0006_0F91AAEACD6B3228">
This <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> man now dwelt in <HI>Shu|&s;han,</HI> (&s;aid to have been the plea&s;ante&s;t city then in the world,) he dwelt in the king's pre&s;ence and was his <HI>favourite;</HI> and had great <HI>riches</HI> and <HI>honor:</HI> yet he felt for the afflictions of his peo|ple, and cho&s;e rather to go and &s;uffer with them, that he might promote their welfare, than to en|joy all the plea&s;ures of that &s;plendid court.</P>
<P>Who can &s;ufficiently admire his excellent &s;pi|rit, and his excellent conduct amid&s;t his country's di&s;tre&s;&s;es!</P>
<P>He came and encouraged the Jews, and &s;et about repairing the city, and fini&s;hed it, though he was <HI>derided</HI> and <HI>counteracted</HI> and plotted a|gain&s;t continually; and though they were called <HI>rebels</HI> by many <HI>powerful enemies</HI> in the neigh|bourhood, and even by a number of the NOBLES OF JUDAH, who join'd with their heathen ad|ver&s;aries again&s;t him.</P>
<P>After this, though they were in their own land, dwelt again in their <HI>city</HI> Jeru&s;alem, and had the wor&s;hip of the temple re&s;tor'd, yet they were in a <HI>poor, weak</HI> and <HI>di&s;tre&s;s'd</HI> condition to what they were before their late troubles.</P>
<P>And therefore we read, in the beginning of this Chapter&mdash;<HI>That, in the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of I&s;rael were a&s;&s;embled with fa&s;ting and with &s;ackcloths, and with earth upon them. And the &s;eed of I&s;rael &s;eparated them&s;elves from all &s;trangers, and &s;tood and con|fe&s;&s;ed their &s;ins and the iniquities of their fathers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013758_0007_0F91AAECC1248AA0">
Then they recounted the many &s;ignal favors to them and to their fathers, and the ill returns they had made: and then pray that God will put an end to their grievous troubles.</P>
<P><HI>Howbeit</HI> (&s;ay they) thou art ju&s;t in <HI>all that is brought upon us; for thou ha&s;t done right, but we</HI> have done <HI>wickedly.</HI></P>
<P>And the prayer concludes in the words of my text, wherein they recount their <HI>calamities,</HI> and promi&s;e to renew their <HI>covenant</HI> with God.</P>
<P><HI>Behold we are &s;ervants this day; and for the land which thou gave&s;t unto our fathers, to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof; behold we are &s;ervants in it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And it yieldeth much increa&s;e unto the kings which thou ha&s;t &s;et over us, becau&s;e of our &s;ins. Al&s;o they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their plea&s;ure; and we are in great di&s;tre&s;s! That is,</HI> though we are, through di|vine goodne&s;s, in our own land; yet we are but <HI>&s;ervants</HI> and <HI>tributaries.</HI> We are not allow'd to call the country our own: The Lord, indeed, gave the good land to our fathers to improve and enjoy all the ble&s;&s;ings of it: But now tho&s;e whom the Per&s;ian Emperor hath placed over us&mdash;(whether by right or not) are our <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ters:</HI> And we hold all our ble&s;&s;ings, even our <HI>E&s;tates</HI> and <HI>Lives,</HI> but as tenants at <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>It yieldeth much increa&s;e (for it is a good land) unto the Kings, which for our Sins. God
<PB N="10" REF="013758_0008_0F91AAEDD0F90C08">
&s;uffers to lord it over us. But we can call no|thing our own: For, they claim ab&s;olute domi|nion over our <HI>Bodies,</HI> our <HI>Cattle</HI> and all that we have, to call for it and di&s;po&s;e of it at their plea|&s;ure: So that in a word, <HI>we are in great di&s;tre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And, becau&s;e of all this, we make a &s;ure cove|nant, and write it; and our Princes, Levites and Prie&s;ts &s;eal unto it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That is,</HI> (as one expre&s;&s;es the &s;en&s;e) "and though even what we now enjoy be much more than we de&s;erve; yet do thou &s;till ca&s;t an eye of further pity upon the mi&s;ery of our condition, accept our pre&s;ent repentance, and that &s;olemn engagement we now, all of us lay our&s;elves un|der, to be obedient for the future, to thy holy commands."</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e words, thus introduced, and open|ed, I &s;hall make the following ob&s;ervations, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>I. <HI>That &s;ome people may ju&s;tly call the land they live in, their own, by a divine gift to their fathers.</HI></P>
<P>II. <HI>That yet, &s;uch is the tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion of the kings of the earth, that, where there is the cleare&s;t title, the owners are &s;ometimes deprived of it, or of the ble&s;&s;ings of it, which is the &s;ame thing.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>That it is for a people's &s;ins, when God &s;uffers this to come upon them.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>That though a people are &s;uffered to live in their own Land, and it be ever &s;o good in it&s;elf, yet if they hold all their ble&s;&s;ings only at the plea|&s;ure of others, and can call nothing their own, they are, &s;trictly &s;peaking, &s;ervants, and not freemen: and mu&s;t be in great di&s;tre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="013758_0009_0F91AAEDF1790A00">
V. <HI>That it becomes &s;uch a people to fly unto God by &s;olemn fa&s;ting and prayer, for relief, even after they have done all they can for their own pre&s;ervation.</HI></P>
<P>VI. <HI>If they would, on good grounds, hope for &s;ucce&s;s, they &s;hould renew their covenant with God, or lay them&s;elves under the mo&s;t &s;olemn ob|ligations to be an obedient and holy people, for the time to come.</HI></P>
<P>I. <HI>Then I ob&s;erve&mdash;That &s;ome People may ju&s;t|ly call the Land they live in, their own, by a di|vine gift to their fathers.</HI></P>
<P>So I&s;rael, in this prayer, call'd the land of Ju|dea,&mdash;<HI>the land which thou gave&s;t unto our fathers:</HI> And which therefore they implicitly call <HI>their own</HI> by inheritance from them.</P>
<P>And &s;ure there was no room to di&s;pute their title, if God, the great Proprietor of the world had a right to di&s;po&s;e of it: For he gave it to I&s;rael for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as the &s;criptures abun|dantly te&s;tify; &s;o that I need not &s;tand to quote particular pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>This land therefore was indubitably <HI>their's;</HI> &s;o <HI>their's,</HI> that no body under Heaven had a right to deprive them of it, nor could do it without wrong and inju&s;tice; for it was <HI>their's</HI> (as I may &s;ay) by <HI>deed of gift</HI> from <HI>the great Lord of all.</HI></P>
<P>Nor were they the only people in the world who could challenge a ju&s;t right and title, yea a divine one, to the country they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd. For God originally gave the whole Earth to the &s;ons
<PB N="12" REF="013758_0010_0F91AAEEBB479150">
of men to be <HI>divided</HI> among them. And where|ever any went and found any part of the Earth <HI>unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> or <HI>fairly purcha&s;ed</HI> of the <HI>rightful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors,</HI> they al&s;o might ju&s;tly call it <HI>their own land,</HI> their proper inheritance, given them by God; though not &s;o expre&s;sly given as Canaan was to I&s;rael. Nor will, or can this be denied by any who pretend to have any <HI>ju&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions</HI> on Earth: &s;o that I need not enlarge. But may proceed to ob&s;erve&mdash;</P>
<P>II. <HI>That yet, &s;uch is the oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny of the Kings of the earth, that, where there is the cleare&s;t title, the owners are &s;ometimes depri|ved of it, or of the ble&s;&s;ings of it; which is the &s;ame thing.</HI></P>
<P>So it was in the ca&s;e before us. The <HI>King of A&s;&s;yria</HI> came up again&s;t I&s;rael, only from a lu&s;t of <HI>power,</HI> and to &s;pread his dominions; came up again&s;t I&s;rael and di&s;quieted them in their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which God had given them; yea de&s;troyed their city and country, to which he had no pretence of right (unle&s;s it was that <HI>Abraham</HI> the <HI>ance&s;tor</HI> of this nation anciently emigrated from <HI>Chaldea</HI> a part of his empire, which was too ab&s;urd to mention) yet he came and carried them away captive; and <HI>&s;eventy years</HI> detained them in his own land; and grievou&s;ly afflicted them.</P>
<P>But at length the Lord had compa&s;&s;ion on his people, and &s;tirred up <HI>Cyrus</HI> and afterwards other Kings to give them leave to return to their own
<PB N="13" REF="013758_0011_0F91AAEF79B96F70">
land, and rebuild their <HI>city</HI> and <HI>temple</HI> in trou|blous times.</P>
<P>But yet even then they held them under tri|bute, and challenged the di&s;po&s;al of them and of all they had, at their plea&s;ure; becau&s;e they had <HI>power</HI> &s;o to do, though no pretence of <HI>right</HI> at all.</P>
<P>For, if <HI>mere conque&s;t</HI> gives right, then <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power</HI> mu&s;t be the &s;ame thing: and &s;o every <HI>man</HI> as well as a <HI>King</HI> mu&s;t have a <HI>right</HI> to do whatever he has <HI>power</HI> to do. And then there could be no &s;uch thing as <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> in the world: which is mo&s;t ab&s;urd and impious to a&s;&s;ert!</P>
<P>And yet this has been (I may almo&s;t &s;ay the manner of the King's of the earth,) though they dare not avow the principle, yet they have acted as if they thought they had a <HI>right</HI> to do whatever they had <HI>power</HI> to do; without paying any regard to <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong.</HI> Where they were able to overcome their neighbours, and took a fancy to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, they have made it their practice, time out of mind, to go and &s;eize, by force, them and their land: &s;ometimes carrying them away <HI>captive;</HI> and at other times &s;uffering them to live in their own land, as <HI>tenants at will</HI> under <HI>tribute:</HI> and &s;ometimes under &s;uch cruel oppre&s;&s;ion as to deprive them of all the ble&s;&s;ings of a good and fruitful land. This is too plain and melancholy a truth to dwell upon.</P>
<P>I proceed therefore to ob&s;erve&mdash;</P>
<P>III. <HI>That it is for a people's &s;ins when God &s;uffers this evil to come upon them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="013758_0012_0F91AAF172437650">
So I&s;rael acknowledged in the text, and thro' this whole prayer.</P>
<P><HI>It yieldeth</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>much increa&s;e to the Kings which thou hath &s;et over us,</HI> BECAUSE OF OUR SINS.</P>
<P>And whoever con&s;iders the nature of God, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s and kindne&s;s of his govern|ment, may be &s;ure that this is always the ca&s;e: For, he doth not <HI>afflict willingly,</HI> nor needle&s;sly <HI>grieve</HI> the children of men. He cannot delight in tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion! No, his Soul abhors it; and though he &s;ometimes <HI>&s;uffers</HI> it to puni&s;h an <HI>ungrateful</HI> people, who would not be drawn by the cords of a man and the bands of love; yet we &s;ee in the &s;acred hi&s;tory, that after he had puni&s;h'd his people by &s;ome <HI>haughty tyrants,</HI> he took his time to puni&s;h them al&s;o for their op|pre&s;&s;ion. And never do we find a people for&s;a|ken of God who had not for&s;aken him fir&s;t.</P>
<P>And though we are &s;tumbled at the ways of God, when we &s;ee the world groaning for &s;o many ages under the cruele&s;t <HI>tyranny</HI> and <HI>op|pre&s;&s;ion;</HI> yet I doubt not, could we &s;ee through the rea&s;ons of it, we &s;hould be &s;atisfied with the divine proceedings. We &s;hould &s;ee that they were fir&s;t given up to &s;uch <HI>ignorance</HI> or over|grown <HI>wickedne&s;s,</HI> that it was nece&s;&s;ary to curb them in this <HI>&s;evere</HI> and <HI>rigorous</HI> way.</P>
<P>And when they are &s;uitably humbled and brought to repentance, he delights in granting them deliverance, and never fails of doing it. The
<PB N="15" REF="013758_0013_0F91AAF1B22A4900">
<HI>Scripture hi&s;tory,</HI> and indeed <HI>all hi&s;tory,</HI> is abun|dant witne&s;s of this: And thereto I appeal.</P>
<P>And proceed&mdash;</P>
<P>IV. <HI>To ob&s;erve, that though a people are &s;uf|fered to live in their own land, and it be ever &s;o good in it&s;elf,</HI> yet, <HI>if they hold all their ble&s;&s;ings, only at the plea&s;ure of others, and can call nothing their own, they are &s;trictly &s;peaking,</HI> SERVANTS <HI>and not freemen: and mu&s;t be in great di&s;tre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This was the very ca&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> at the time of this <HI>Fa&s;t.</HI> They were re&s;tor'd to their own land: But they were not allowed to call it <HI>their own.</HI> The <HI>Per&s;ian Emperor</HI> had an ab&s;olute power over them, and all that they had; &s;o that they held all by the mo&s;t precarious tenure&mdash;his <HI>will</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ure.</HI> He claimed their <HI>Cattle,</HI> their <HI>Silver,</HI> their <HI>Gold,</HI> their <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> and <HI>Lands,</HI> and even their <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> and called for them and di&s;po&s;ed of them at his <HI>plea&s;ure.</HI> And therefore &s;ay they&mdash;<HI>Behold, we are Servants this day!</HI> And again&mdash;<HI>We are Servants in it!</HI>&mdash;that is in <HI>our own Land.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;ure it was &s;o. They were not <HI>Freemen,</HI> but perfect <HI>Servants,</HI> if a foreign power had do|minion over them and their &s;ub&s;tance. Such per&s;ons really have no <HI>property</HI> at all. For how can we call that <HI>ours,</HI> which others may call for, and take away, when they plea&s;e. Every <HI>Slave</HI> in the world may call him&s;elf a <HI>freeman</HI> as well as the&s;e: And mo&s;t of them with greater propriety. For mo&s;t of them are allow'd &s;omething which they may call <HI>their's.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="013758_0014_0F91AAF269E38E78">
And they who cannot call any thing their own; let them live in a land like Canaan, it is almo&s;t nothing to them.</P>
<P>It may <HI>yield much fruit,</HI> but if all be&s;ides a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, ju&s;t to keep them fit for &s;ervice, mu&s;t go to their ma&s;ters, they may be in <HI>great di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> in the mid&s;t of the jollity of their ta&s;k|ma&s;ters; and pine away, as many poor &s;ouls do, amid&s;t floods of <HI>milk</HI> and <HI>honey, wine</HI> and <HI>oyl.</HI></P>
<P>And whoever looks over the world, will find, that where &s;uch an <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> dominion is claim'd over the people, they are almo&s;t univer&s;ally re|duc'd to every kind of <HI>di&s;tre&s;s.</HI> The world which is now groaning under bondage is a me|lancholy witne&s;s of this.</P>
<P>Could you but look into the dark places of the earth, and &s;ee the habitations of cruelty, and hear the <HI>cries</HI> and <HI>groans</HI> of the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> who have no <HI>comforter,</HI> becau&s;e on <HI>the &s;ide of the op|pre&s;&s;ors there is power;</HI> it would make every tender heart ake and ready to bur&s;t with grief!

<P>And yet this is the be&s;t any can hope for, who are once depriv'd of <HI>liberty,</HI> or of the priviledges of freemen. I proceed to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>V. <HI>That it becomes a people in &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;s'd condition to fly unto God by &s;olemn fa&s;ting and prayer for relief, even after they have done all they can for their own pre&s;ervation.</HI></P>
<P>So did I&s;rael here. <HI>Nehemiah</HI> like a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>prudent</HI> man, did not &s;it &s;till and pre&s;ume upon <HI>providence;</HI> but encourag'd the Jews to ari&s;e and build the wall of their city, and make it as de|&s;en&s;ible as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t the enemy; and gave orders to u&s;e all caution, &s;o as not to give their enemies any advantage, by <HI>&s;hutting</HI> and <HI>barring</HI> the <HI>gates</HI> in &s;ea&s;on every night, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But, like a pious man, &s;en&s;ible that all &s;alva|tion is of the Lord, he coun&s;el'd them not to depend upon their own <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> or <HI>&s;trength;</HI> but to commit their cau&s;e to God. And therefore call'd a &s;olemn fa&s;t to humble them&s;elves before God, and to &s;eek his face.</P>
<P>And they a&s;&s;embled for this end, and <HI>mourned</HI> before him; and <HI>made confe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins,</HI> and poured out <HI>&s;upplications</HI> to him to e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e, and deliver them from their <HI>oppre&s;&s;ions,</HI> and from all their <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es;</HI> and re&s;tore them to that happy &s;tate of freedom they once enjoyed.</P>
<P>And what could be more rea&s;onable? For, to whom &s;hall people go in their di&s;tre&s;s of any

kind, but unto God, who can do all things for them? And, particularly, when they are groaning under the oppre&s;&s;ion of the great and powerful, to whom &s;hall they go for relief, but to him that is <HI>greater</HI> and <HI>higher</HI> than they, who &s;etteth up kings, and putteth them down, and overturns kingdoms at his plea&s;ure, if it be nece&s;&s;ary, to work deliverance for his people.</P>
<P>The Lord is a <HI>&s;ure refuge</HI> in &s;uch a time of trouble. He is a <HI>&s;trong tower,</HI> and who&s;oever flies to him &s;hall be &s;afe, under the &s;hadow of his wings, again&s;t all the powers on earth.</P>
<P>Even the haughty <HI>Human</HI> &s;hall fall before him, when he meditates mi&s;chief to the people of God. And proud <HI>Senacherib,</HI> when he vainly boa&s;ts of his <HI>numbers</HI> and <HI>&s;trength,</HI> &s;hall be &s;truck, as by a fla&s;h of lightning, and his mighty ho&s;t, in which he tru&s;ted, become in one night <HI>dead corp&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>He can even &s;hut the mouths of <HI>hungry lions,</HI> or quench the hotte&s;t <HI>furnace,</HI> when his &s;ervants, who tru&s;t in him, are to be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Only then let a people engage God on their &s;ide, and they need not fear what man can do unto them.</P>
<P>And in order to this, God expects to be <HI>&s;ought</HI> unto, in a public &s;olemn manner; and, that we <HI>humble</HI> our&s;elves before him.</P>
<P>And our Saviour has taught us, that prayer, ac|companied with <HI>fa&s;ting,</HI> has peculiar prevalence with heaven; having &s;aid (of the evil &s;pirit)&mdash;<HI>this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and fa&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="013758_0017_0F91AAF7AED04890">
And the people of God have practic'd it in all ages, and found the benefit of it: And &s;o did <HI>Nineveh,</HI> when threatned with &s;peedy de&s;truction, and were &s;pared.</P>
<P>And &s;o have <HI>our fathers</HI> in their day, and we in ours.</P>
<P>In this way a people make a &s;olemn appeal to God, as the great governor of the world, when the powers of earth ri&s;e up again&s;t them, and ca&s;t them&s;elves upon him. And the Lord expects to be acknowledg'd, if we need his help: And we have no rea&s;on to look for it without.</P>
<P>Moreover &s;uch a day is de&s;ign'd as a day of <HI>humiliation</HI> for our <HI>&s;ins,</HI> which have procur'd the evils which are upon us. And this, if &s;incere, can't but be acceptable to God. And we know that he hath &s;aid&mdash;<HI>He that humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted.</HI> (<HI>Luke</HI> xiv. II.) And if &s;uch a day is not a day of &s;incere humiliation, it is a mockery.</P>
<P>Which leads me to the next ob&s;ervation,</P>
<P>VI. <HI>That if a people would on good grounds hope for &s;ucce&s;s, they &s;hould renew their covenant with God; or lay them&s;elves under the mo&s;t &s;olemn obligations to be an obedient and holy people, for the time to come.</HI></P>
<P>So did I&s;rael at this time.</P>
<P><HI>And becau&s;e of all this, we make a &s;ure cove|nant and write it; and our Princes, Levites and Prie&s;ts &s;eal unto it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="013758_0018_0F91AAF8B57BFC70">
The covenant was &s;ign'd and &s;eal'd by the principal per&s;ons&mdash;And <HI>the re&s;t of the people</HI> took a <HI>&s;olemn oath</HI> to do as the &s;ub&s;cribers had engag'd.</P>
<P>What the covenant was, you &s;ee in the next chapter.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in general they covenanted&mdash;<HI>to walk in God's law&mdash;and to ob&s;erve and do all the com|mandments of the Lord their God;</HI> and <HI>his judg|ments, and his &s;tatutes:</HI> Particularly, that they would not intermarry with the heathen&mdash;that they would keep the <HI>&s;abbath</HI> religiou&s;ly&mdash;and the &s;abbatical year&mdash;punctually pay their tribute to the temple&mdash;and give the Prie&s;ts and Levites their due&mdash;and no more <HI>for&s;ake</HI> the <HI>hou&s;e of their God.</HI></P>
<P>And what can it &s;ignify to pretend to <HI>humble</HI> our&s;elves before God, on &s;uch a day, and to <HI>con|fe&s;s our &s;ins,</HI> unle&s;s we al&s;o engage to for&s;ake them, and do better for the time to come?</P>
<P>And if a &s;olemn covenant was drawn up, in which we &s;hould bind our&s;elves to God and one another to reform the gro&s;s evils which are found among us, and to be in all things an <HI>obedient</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> people, it might be well.</P>
<P>This formal and &s;olemn renewing the <HI>cove|nant</HI> has been practiced by &s;ome chri&s;tian &s;ocieties, and recommended by others. And I am ready to think it might have a good effect.</P>
<P>But, the lea&s;t people can do on &s;uch a day is, to <HI>re&s;olve</HI> and <HI>engage,</HI> in the mo&s;t &s;erious and deli|berate

manner, to reform all our crying iniquities, which have provok'd God again&s;t us, and to <HI>obey</HI> and <HI>&s;erve</HI> him for the time to come. Without this, they do nothing at all to purpo&s;e, and can expect no ble&s;&s;ing. Scripture and rea&s;on both con&s;pire to a&s;&s;ure us of this; and no thinking man can doubt.</P>
<P>Thus have I gone through with the &s;everal ob|&s;ervations from the words, and &s;hall now con|clude with &s;ome <HI>application</HI> and <HI>improvement.</HI></P>
<P>And now, methinks, almo&s;t every thing that has been &s;aid, is naturally applicable to our&s;elves in this evil day: And we can hardly help &s;eeing the improvement we ought to make.</P>
<P>However, I &s;hall take a little pains to <HI>apply</HI> it, and to pre&s;s the <HI>improvement.</HI></P>
<P>Now if any people on earth, &s;ince the Jews, have a right to call the land they live in <HI>their own,</HI> and to &s;ay <HI>God gave it to our fathers</HI>&mdash;we may &s;ay it.</P>
<P>About <HI>an hundred and fifty-four years</HI> &s;ince, our fathers were driven by the then raging per|&s;ecution, out of the land of their nativity; and came to &s;eek in the wilds of <HI>America</HI> (then cal|led <HI>the new world</HI>) that liberty which they were denied at home, (but little thought they &s;hould ever be denied here.) They came with the King's leave, tho' at their own expence. (and a va&s;t expence it was, no le&s;s, by the faire&s;t and lowe&s;t computation, than TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING, the &s;ettling this &s;ingle province.)</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="013758_0020_0F91AAF9EC01CEE0">
They &s;ound it an howling wilderne&s;s, <HI>de&s;titute</HI> and <HI>doleful!</HI> And about half the number of the fir&s;t adventurers died the fir&s;t winter under the unparallell'd hard&s;hips they &s;uffered.</P>
<P>However, God was with them, and encourag'd them; and &s;ettled them in this land;&mdash;an hand|ful of men from whom, with &s;ome additions af|terwards, have ari&s;en this great multitude, who now occupy the land.</P>
<P>And, as no body on earth had any title to this land but the <HI>original inhabitants</HI>&mdash;our fathers got leave of them to &s;ettle, and made peace with them, and fairly <HI>purchas'd</HI> their lands of them.</P>
<P><HI>The king</HI> had no right to give it, nor the <HI>peo|ple of England,</HI> for it was not their's to give. But God gave our fathers favour in the eyes of the people of the land; and they obtain'd <HI>their title</HI> to the&s;e lands; which was as good as the people of <HI>England</HI> have to theirs; or any other people under heaven. All pretences to the con|trary are vain and frivolous to the la&s;t degree.</P>
<P>Surely then the land is <HI>ours.</HI> The Lord our God gave it unto our fathers: And we have it by <HI>inheritance from them.</HI> There is no better title this day on earth.</P>
<P>And yet, if a title could be given by the king, we have that al&s;o, in our charter; which was a &s;olemn <HI>covenant</HI> between <HI>him</HI> and our <HI>fathers;</HI> in which they engag'd to be his <HI>&s;ubjects,</HI> though remov'd out of his dominions to the ends of the
<PB N="23" REF="013758_0021_0F91AAFACBBB4FA8">
earth, on condition of their enjoying by his means, <HI>all the rights and privileges of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects;</HI> (one of which be &s;ure was the &s;afe en|joyment of our <HI>property.</HI>)</P>
<P>And this they depended upon enjoying when they ventur'd their lives and fortunes to extend the Briti&s;h empire to this end of the world.</P>
<P>And yet <HI>&s;acred</HI> as <HI>this charter</HI> was, and richly as we de&s;erv'd it, by the hard&s;hips we &s;uffer'd, and the immen&s;e advantage we have been to the land of our forefathers nativity; yet, in a popi&s;h reign, (that of James the &s;econd) our <HI>charter</HI> was taken away; and, &s;o hard was our fate, after all our expen&s;ive &s;olicitations, only the &s;hadow of it could be recovered; tho' it was the only one lo&s;t in that general wreck of charters, which was not re&s;tored, at the revolution.</P>
<P>And now, after we have render'd chearfully all the &s;ervice in our power to our nation&mdash;in reducing <HI>Cape Breton, Nova-Scotia</HI> and <HI>Canada:</HI> Some of which we did in a manner alone; and in the whole did much more than our proportion: Yet, becau&s;e we reap &s;ome benefit hereby, as &s;oon as we have &s;truggled thro' innumerable difficul|ties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es for a century and an half, and begin &s;ome of us, to live a little comfortably in this wilderne&s;s, they envy us our happine&s;s, and thir&s;t after our inheritance. And becau&s;e they have &s;quandered away the nation's money in the mo&s;t &s;hameful manner, and by this bad hu&s;bandry are got immen&s;ely in debt; behold, they threaten to
<PB N="24" REF="013758_0022_0F91AAFB82F337F0">
take away all our <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>property,</HI> and to re|duce us to <HI>&s;lavery</HI> and <HI>beggary.</HI></P>
<P>And, which is mo&s;t aggravating, the king's re|venue, it &s;eems, is not helped by it.</P>
<P>But the money extorted from us is given to <HI>placemen</HI> and <HI>pen&s;ioners</HI> here, who are to be our ta&s;k-ma&s;ters to afflict us, and riot on our &s;poils!</P>
<P>Is it merely then to impoveri&s;h us that we are to be thus fleec'd to the &s;kin? No! The plot is deep, and wor&s;e is yet behind! The&s;e men are by this means to be attach'd hereby to their in|tere&s;t, and to be their SPIES and INFORMERS again&s;t us from time to time.</P>
<P>They expect letters from them like tho&s;e from the enemies of Judah in the days of <HI>Ezra.</HI> (See <HI>Ezra</HI> iv. 14.) <HI>Now,</HI> FORASMUCH AS WE HAVE MAINTENANCE FROM THE KING'S PA|LACE, <HI>and it was not meet for us to &s;ee the king's di&s;honour, therefore we have &s;ent and certified the king,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>And their policy was much the &s;ame. They <HI>&s;et Ta&s;k-ma&s;ters over them, to afflict them. And made their lives bitter with hard bondage</HI>&mdash;and rigorous &s;ervice.</P>

And when they &s;aw that this did not do, being determin'd, if po&s;&s;ible, by right or by wrong, to carry their point, (for tyranny once begun has no bounds) they took the mo&s;t horrid method ever heard of: They &s;ent out a <HI>bloody decree,</HI> and or|der'd the midwives to <HI>kill</HI> every <HI>male child</HI> as &s;oon as it was born.

we flatter'd our&s;elves they would never exerci&s;e this pretended right; but it would forever lay dormant.</P>
<P>But we have found our&s;elves mi&s;taken.

Yea, let the coun&s;el of the Lord be acceptable to you this day&mdash;And let us break off from all our iniquities by righteou&s;ne&s;s, and from our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, by &s;hewing mercy to tho&s;e who are <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> among us, if it may be a lengthning of our tranquility. Without this, all our cries and tears are but a mockery, and will procure us a cur&s;e in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>And unle&s;s God be better to us than we are to our&s;elves, all the evils which hand over us will fall upon us, and perhaps &s;eventimes more (if it can be) till we are reduc'd to the mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;tate of mortals, if not utterly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>And, if you, and this people, will not hear, my &s;oul, and the &s;ouls of all the godly in the land, &s;hall weep in &s;ecret places for your <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>&s;turbborne&s;s,</HI> and for all the <HI>calamities</HI> and <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> which a few days more may bring forth.</P>
<P>O my brethren,&mdash;come and let us return to the God of mercy, who delighteth to be gracious! Let us do it without delay! And who knows but the day in which our enemies hope to triumph in the overthrow of all our liberties, God may (as he did to his people of old, in the days of <HI>Human</HI>) make the dry of our <HI>deliverance</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="013758_0029_0F91AB0837E9D7C0">
and of the overthrow of our implacable enemies; and &s;ettle our <HI>rights</HI> on a firmer foundation than ever.</P>
<P><HI>Our fathers tru&s;ted in God,</HI> and <HI>he did deliver them.</HI> And the &s;ame Lord yet reigneth, therefore let New-England, yea let the <HI>earth rejoice!</HI> For, I firmly believe, that if we are not gro&s;ly want|ing to our&s;elves, but commit our &s;elves and our cau&s;e to the God of our fathers, in well doing, when we have &s;uffer'd a while, he will al&s;o deliver us.</P>
<P>But, if not, the Lord prepare us for the mo&s;t evil days, which may be before us; and give us grace &s;o to improve them, as to make us thir&s;t more earne&s;tly for a better world, where the <HI>wicked cea&s;e from troubling,</HI> and the <HI>weary are at re&s;t.</HI></P>
