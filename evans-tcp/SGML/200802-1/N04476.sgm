<HEAD>AN ESSAY On the WEST-INDIA DRY-GRIPES.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>European</HI> Phy&s;icians give an Account of a Di&s;ea&s;e &s;imilar to the <HI>Dry-Gripes,</HI> calling it <HI>Cholic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pictonum,</HI> becau&s;e mo&s;t frequent at <HI>Poic|tiers.</HI> They are both attended with exce&s;|&s;ive griping Pains in the Pit of the Stomach and Bowels, which are much di&s;tended with Wind; violent and frequent Reach|ings to vomit, &s;ometimes bringing up &s;mall Quantities of bilious Matter; at other times there is a Sen&s;ation, as if the Bowels were drawn together by Ropes; great Co&s;tive|ne&s;s, and frequently a continual Inclination to go to Stool without voiding any Thing.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="005553_0010_1018660E5EC15250">
The Ducts which open into the Inte|&s;tines, and excern a Mucus to moi&s;ten and lubricate them, are ob&s;tructed and glewed up with a Vi&s;co&s;ity not ea&s;ily re&s;olvable; and through the whole Cour&s;e of the Di|&s;temper, the Faeces are extremely dry and hard, in &s;mall Lumps like Bullets. The Inte&s;tines are drawn up towards the Back with almo&s;t continual convul&s;ive Twitches. The Pains are frequently &s;o &s;harp, that the Patient will fall on the Floor, and cry out violently in the greate&s;t Agony.</P>
<P>The Alcaline Acrimony impacted on the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, is &s;o great in ma|ny Ca&s;es, as to communicate its malign In|fluence to the whole nervous Sy&s;tem, cau|&s;ing violent Convul&s;ions, which are very dangerous Symptoms; tho' I have known many recover after having a Number of them. But if the exce&s;&s;ive Pain continues any con&s;iderable Time, the <HI>Peri&s;taltic</HI> Mo|tion of the Inte&s;tines becomes inverted, and the <HI>Iliac Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> en&s;ues.</P>
<P>This &s;ore Malady u&s;ually degenerates in|to the Pal&s;y, and a Deprivation of all Sort of Motion in the Hands and Feet.&mdash;Doctor <HI>Willis</HI> conjectured, that the Tran&s;ition of a
<PB N="3" REF="005553_0011_10186613477E0B88">
Cholic to a Pal&s;y, was a Sign that the Morbific Matter was tran&s;mitted not by the Arteries, but the <HI>Nerves,</HI> and that its Seat was not in the Coats of the Inte&s;tines, but the nervous Plexus of the <HI>Me&s;entery;</HI> which is very &s;en&s;ible, and obnoxious to an Afflux of Humours of the nervous Kind. But this Remark of Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> can on|ly relate to the Hy&s;teric Cholic, which &s;ometimes counterfeits the Bilious; being accompanied with a Pain about the <HI>Scro|biculum Cordis,</HI> the Region of the Stomach, and a little lower, which is followed with a Vomiting of Humours of a green or yel|low Colour, and a great Sinking of the Spi|rits; after a Day or two the Pain goes off, but upon the &s;lighte&s;t Commotion or Per|turbation of the Mind, it &s;oon returns again. In this Ca&s;e, neither Cathartics nor Cly&s;ters have any Place, as they exa&s;perate the Di&s;|temper; &s;o that this Di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to pro|ceed rather from the Di&s;order of the Spirits, than the Fault of the Humours. Phy&s;icians, therefore, ought above all things to be cau|tious, that they mi&s;take not the <HI>Diagno&s;tic,</HI> by imagining that the Symptoms which attend Hy&s;teric Women, do ari&s;e from
<PB N="4" REF="005553_0012_101866150E9B5588">
&s;uch Di&s;tempers as they frequently counter|feit.</P>
<P>The remote Cau&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an ob&s;tructed Per&s;piration, by being too much expo&s;ed to a moi&s;t Night Air, and cold raw Winds; hard Drinking, e&s;pecially Drams or &s;trong Punch; and Want of a good Di|ge&s;tion, which renders the Chyle crude and vi&s;cid; but the proximate Cau&s;e is an acri|monious Bile.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, the Opinion of &s;everal in|genious and worthy modern Authors, that this Di&s;temper is cau&s;ed by taking large Quantities of Lime-juice; but I mu&s;t beg Leave to differ from their Sentiments in this Ca&s;e: For &s;eeing the Humours which vel|licate and fret the Coats of the Stomach and Inte&s;tines are intirely alcaline, Acids mu&s;t be (and Experience confirms it) the mo&s;t effectual Remedies. Thus the Negroes, in &s;ome Parts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> ea&s;e their exce&s;&s;ive Pains in the <HI>Dry-Gripes</HI> by eat|ing Limes, or drinking the Juice. It has likewi&s;e been ob&s;erved, that &s;ince the Peo|ple of <HI>America</HI> have drank Punch with more Water (which moi&s;tens the Faeces, and dilutes the acrid Salts of the Bile) and made
<PB N="5" REF="005553_0013_1018661833D6C850">
of old Spirit (which has le&s;s of the hot fiery Particles than when new from the Still) yet with much more Lime-juice than for|merly, the <HI>Dry-Gripes</HI> is not near &s;o com|mon as before this Cu&s;tom prevailed.</P>
<P>In all Kinds of Di&s;ea&s;es it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to know the Cau&s;e; for other|wi&s;e to attempt a Cure, is like a blind Man &s;hooting at a Mark; the Remedies in one Ca&s;e being directly oppo&s;ite and de&s;tructive in another. Thus if a Fever, proceeding from a hot, inflammatory, alcaline Cau&s;e, be treated with a hot Regimen, and not with an acid cooling One, the Patient mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h; but, on the contrary, if Acidity is the Cau&s;e (as it commonly is in Children) the alcaline Method is to be pre|ferred. As therefore a Phy&s;ician, not care|fully regarding the Symptoms and the Cau&s;e of a Fever, may prove the De&s;truc|tion of the Patient; &s;o in all Cholics the Symptoms and the Cau&s;e are to be princi|pally regarded; and for want of a nice and exact Attendance thereto, a too general Me|thod of Cure very &s;eldom meets with Suc|ce&s;s in either Ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005553_0014_1018661E9A654F18">
But before I enter upon the Cure of the <HI>Dry-Gripes,</HI> Humanity obliges me to ob|&s;erve, that the Per&s;ons who are mo&s;t liable to it are generally lean, and much emaci|ated, by their exce&s;&s;ive Per&s;piration in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> and con&s;equently the aque|ous Parts of the Blood being thus evaporat|ed, the &s;aline Particles mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be|come exceeding acrid. The Method, there|fore, to prevent this Malady in &s;uch Con|&s;titutions, is obvious, <HI>viz.</HI> To ab&s;tain, in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and in Summer on the Continent, from Drams and &s;trong Punch; &s;alted and high &s;ea&s;oned Meats; immode|rate Exerci&s;e, which rai&s;es Sweat; and pro|fu&s;e Venery: To ri&s;e early in a Mornings; to take Chocolate for Breakfa&s;t and Sup|per; make frequent u&s;e of Broths and boiled Meats, emollient and acid Herbs and Fruits; dilute plentifully with tepid, &s;mall, and &s;ubacid Liquors; and when co&s;tive, to take a &s;mall &s;aponaceous Purge, &s;o as to procure one Stool a Day.</P>
<P>The following Method I have found, by many Years Experience, &s;ucce&s;sful in the <HI>Dry-Gripes,</HI> and were it more generally
<PB N="7" REF="005553_0015_101866207046C7A8">
practi&s;ed, I believe the Lives and Limbs of great Numbers might be &s;aved.</P>
<P>To mitigate the Violence of the Pains, and prevent Vomiting, I order,</P>
<P><HI>Opii, Grana una vel duo, &s;ive Laudan. li|quid. Sydenham. Guttas triginta, quadra|ginta, vel quinquaginta, et repetend. pro re nata, in majori vel minori Do&s;i, donec Aeger &s;e &s;en&s;it in &s;tatu tolerabili.</HI></P>
<P>If the Vomiting be &s;o bad that the Sto|mach can hardly retain any Thing, the following Powders &s;carce ever fail of &s;uc|ceeding:</P>
<P><HI>R. Tartari Vitriolati, Grana decem; Olei Cinnamomi Guttam unam. M. F. Pulvis &s;umendus in Hau&s;tu Theae Menthae omni (vel &s;ecunda quaque) Hora.</HI></P>
<P>The Vomiting being &s;topped, I have Re|cour&s;e to the following Pre&s;cription, till three or four Stools are obtained:</P>
<P>R. <HI>Cremoris Tartari Grana triginta; Olei Caryophyllorum Guttam unam. M. F.
<PB N="8" REF="005553_0016_10186622ADB9C7B0">
Pulvis &s;umendus in Hau&s;tu T&punc;heae Men|thae (vel Decocti avenacei) omni Hora.</HI></P>
<P>As an ob&s;tinate Co&s;tivene&s;s, and mo&s;t vi|olent Pain of the Bowels, are perpetual Symptoms in this Di&s;ea&s;e, Opiates are to be admini&s;tered through its whole Cour&s;e at proper Intervals. When, therefore, the Pain is very exce&s;&s;ive, I give Opiates even at the &s;ame time with the purging Powders, that the Pain may be rendered tolerable, that a Relaxation of the Inte&s;tines may thence fol|low, and that their Peri&s;taltic Motion may become con&s;tant and regular, and be nei|ther interrupted nor perverted.</P>
<P>Every Pain acts as a Stimulus, or rather, a Stimulus excites a Sen&s;e of Pain: But eve|ry Stimulus provokes the Fibres to Contrac|tions, and, if violent, throws them into Spa&s;ms. When, therefore, a Cholic Pain is very vehement, the Inte&s;tines are in &s;ome Places affected with Convul&s;ions, and are as if bound hard with a Swathe; in&s;omuch, that unle&s;s the Pain is lulled a&s;leep, neither the Faeces nor Wind can be tran&s;mitted downwards: It is for this Rea&s;on, that eve|ry violent Cholic Pain is almo&s;t always at|tended
<PB N="9" REF="005553_0017_10186626E5864ED8">
with a great Co&s;tivene&s;s. It is, there|fore, very rational to add Anodynes to Pur|ges in very vehement Cholics; nor is this any new Practice, &s;eeing the mo&s;t experi|enced <HI>Riverius, in Capite de Dolore Choli|co,</HI> pre&s;cribed <HI>Aloes Drachmam unam, Scammonei Grana &s;ex;</HI> to which he added two Grains of <HI>Opium,</HI> and in one of his Ob&s;ervations even five Grains.</P>
<P>This Cour&s;e, &s;teadily pur&s;ued, gives &s;ometimes three or four Stools in Twenty-four Hours; but if no &s;uch End is obtain|ed, as it often happens (e&s;pecially if the Di|&s;temper is of long Standing) I order the Ab|domen to be cheri&s;hed with an emollient Fomentation, and that more particularly when the Belly is very ten&s;e and hard, or exce&s;&s;ively contracted by a Spa&s;m: For the Fomentation penetrating the Integuments of the Abdomen, &s;oftens and relaxes the too ten&s;e and rigid Fibres. I have often expe|rienced the good Effects of the following Fomentation:</P>
<P>R. <HI>Florum Chamaemeli Manipulos tres; Ra|dicis Althaeae, Seminum Lini et Faenu|graeci, ana Uncias tres; Capitum Papa|veris
<PB N="10" REF="005553_0018_1018662869BCC0E0">
albi Uncias quatuor. Cum Aquae et Lactis recentis, ana Q. S. Va&s;e de|coque clau&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>But I am apt to believe, that far better Effects might be expected, if the Patient made u&s;e of a Semicupium prepared from the &s;ame Ingredients. Every One who has ob&s;erved the very happy Effects of an emol|lient Bath in Nephritic Pains, will very rea|dily agree to what I &s;ay.&mdash;I have, indeed, frequently &s;een the mo&s;t cruel Nephritic Pa|roxy&s;m &s;uddenly vani&s;h by the U&s;e of a Bath only, when neither plentiful Bleeding, nor Opiates given freely, gave the lea&s;t Re|lief: Nay, I have learned, by many Expe|riments, that nothing conduces &s;o much to ea&s;e the Pain, and &s;end the Stone down the Ureters, as a warm and emollient Bath.</P>
<P>I am likewi&s;e of Opinion, that it would very much conduce to a &s;peedy and perfect Cure, if the Patient, through the whole Cour&s;e of the Di&s;temper, made frequent u&s;e of oleaginous Mixtures, which would not only lubricate and relax the Inte&s;tines, but al&s;o, by &s;heathing the lixivial Salts of the Bile, prevent their Points from acting
<PB N="11" REF="005553_0019_1018662B81AF4640">
with &s;o much Force and Energy upon the Stomach and Inte&s;tines. For in this Di&s;|temper, the Secretion of the acrid Salts of the Bile, in the Hepatic Glands, &s;eems to be in an over Proportion to the oily Parts.</P>
<P>Where there is no Vomiting, and the Pain not very acute, the Powders of <HI>Crem. Tartar</HI> may, after giving one Opiate, be u&s;ed as directed, without any Delay. The Effects of which, after &s;ome Time, will be a &s;en&s;ible Perception of the Pain falling gradually downwards, from the Pit of the Stomach towards the Rectum. When, therefore, the Pain is &s;ettled in the lower Parts of the Abdomen, you may, in ca&s;e the Patient is unea&s;y for want of a Stool, pre&s;cribe the following Purge.</P>
<P>R. <HI>Cremoris Tartari Drachmam unam; Radicis Jalapii Grana &s;ex; Olei Cary|ophyllorum Guttam unam. M. f. Pul|vis &s;umendus in Hau&s;tu Decocti avenacei &s;ecunda (vel tertia) quaque Hora.</HI></P>
<P>If this does not, in &s;ix or &s;even Hours, procure a Stool, I order an oleaginous and emollient Cly&s;ter; which not only lubri|cates
<PB N="12" REF="005553_0020_1018662ED295C448">
the Inte&s;tines, but al&s;o &s;oftens the in|durated Faeces.</P>
<P>When the hardened Excrements are car|ried downwards, the Patient begins to break Wind backwards, which is &s;ometimes ex|ceeding offen&s;ive. In the fir&s;t three or four Stools, the Faeces are often very faetid, and abounding with a ropy vi&s;cid Sub&s;tance, re|&s;embling membranous Filaments.</P>
<P>It is a nece&s;&s;ary Caution not to be too ha&s;ty in gaining a Pa&s;&s;age thro' the Body; for if larger Quantities of the &s;ame Medi|cines, or others more &s;timulating, &s;hould be given, you will be often foil'd in your Ex|pectations, and make good a common Say|ing, <HI>The more Ha&s;te, the wor&s;e Speed:</HI> For &s;harp &s;timulating Purges and Cly&s;ters have very bad Effects on the Nerves in this Di&s;|ea&s;e, and endanger a Deprivation of Motion in the Patient's Limbs.</P>
<P>Tho' the Patient generally recovers upon procuring a free Pa&s;&s;age through the Inte|te&s;tines, by the prudent U&s;e of the already mentioned Medicines; yet it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the Body &s;till temperately open for a Week, or more, by the la&s;t pre&s;cribed Purge; to which may be added <HI>Calomel.
<PB N="13" REF="005553_0021_1018663083C126B0">
Grana &s;ex:</HI> For otherwi&s;e the Patient be|comes very co&s;tive, and the exce&s;&s;ive Pains return, by the acrid Humours perpetually flowing into the Inte&s;tines.&mdash;But if not|with&s;tanding all this the Pains &s;hould re|turn, which perhaps may be owing to a greater Degree of Vi&s;cidity in the Fluids, I have known a Dram of the <HI>Tartar. Solu|bil.</HI> taken every three Hours to perfect the Cure; and when that failed, the following has generally &s;ucceeded:</P>
<P>R. <HI>Aquilae albae Grana &s;ex; Con&s;ervae Ro&s;a|rum rubrarum Q. S. ut fiat Bolus omni Mane et Ve&s;peri &s;umendus donec Ptyali&s;|mus excitetur leni&s;&s;imus.</HI></P>
<P>The Calomel, by its Gravity, and the acid adhering to the metalline Part, attenu|ates the Fluids, and forcing open the &s;ecre|tory and excretory Pa&s;&s;ages, an&s;wers the Intention in &s;uch ob&s;tinate Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>When Convul&s;ions happen, &s;trong Sti|mulants are to be avoided; but Anodynes generally relieve, with the Method already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005553_0022_101866350B220190">
In this Di&s;temper the poor Patient being de&s;irous of a Moment's Ea&s;e, even at any Rate, has too commonly a Recour&s;e to Drams, and other &s;pirituous Liquors. But tho' a Moment's Ea&s;e may, by &s;uch Means, be obtained, yet the Di&s;ea&s;e is more &s;trongly rivetted, the Pains return with double Force, and all the Symptoms are va&s;tly ag|gravated.</P>
<P>The proper Drinks in this Di&s;temper are, Water-Gruel, Barley-Water, and &s;uch o|thers as are of the demulcent Kind; which dilute, obtund and di&s;&s;olve, the acrimoni|ous Salts of the Blood.</P>
<P>Till the Stomach and Inte&s;tines have per|fectly recovered their proper Tone, the Pa|tient is very liable to a Relap&s;e, either by taking Cold, drinking too freely of &s;piritu|ous Liquors, or not keeping &s;trictly to Ali|ments which are light and ea&s;y of Dige&s;ti|on: To &s;trengthen, therefore, the Stomach and Bowels after the Patient's Recovery, I order the following Medicines:</P>

&s;o as to &s;hake off and expel the morbific Impurities: For riding on Hor&s;e|back, by the very frequent Jogging of the Body, gently &s;hakes the whole Abdomen; and, therefore, by a continual Pre&s;&s;ure and Agitation, it throws off whatever adheres to the Inte&s;tines, overcomes any Lentor re|maining in the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and very much promotes the Circulation of the Blood thro' the Me&s;enteric Ve&s;&s;els, and little Branches of the <HI>Vena Porta,</HI> where the circulating Fluids move the &s;lowe&s;t. Hence this Exer|ci&s;e, by its almo&s;t continual jolting of the Body, di&s;&s;olves the Blood, concreted partly by the Force of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and partly by its &s;luggi&s;h Motion in tho&s;e Parts; opens the Ob|&s;tructions formed in the <HI>Hepatic, Pancrea|tic, Me&s;enteric,</HI> and <HI>Inte&s;tinal Glands;</HI> and greatly contributes to the Action of the <HI>Spleen,</HI> which is a&s;&s;i&s;ting to that of the Li|ver. La&s;tly, as it is evident, from many Experiments, that Per&s;piration is very much increa&s;ed by Riding, it is of va&s;t Advan|tage not only in this, but in almo&s;t every Chronical Di&s;ea&s;e, by driving the noxious Humours from the Center to the Circum|ference, and expelling them through the

Ducts of the <HI>Milliary Glands.</HI> Riding on|ly, has indeed re&s;tored many, on whom the mo&s;t opero&s;e Medicines have not had the lea&s;t good Effect. Let then the Patient enjoy Health by Riding, and daily acquire Strength by this noble Exerci&s;e.&mdash;The U&s;e of the Fle&s;h-Bru&s;h, and other Frictions, are likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially about the Joints and Limbs, which will promote a bri&s;ker Circulation of the Fluids in tho&s;e Parts. In fine, every Thing is to be u&s;ed which will increa&s;e the Ela&s;ticity of the Fi|bres, attenuate the Fluids, and promote a good Dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>If this Di&s;ea&s;e is complicated with any other, the Judgment of the Phy&s;ician may then vary the Method, according to the different Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e. Thus when the <HI>Dry-Gripes</HI> is only the Symptom of a &s;purious, intermitting Fever, the <HI>Pe|ruvian</HI> Bark, prudently admini&s;tered, is then the only proper Remedy: For the &s;purious Intermittents create a great Varie|ty of direful Symptoms, their true Cha|racteri&s;ticks being di&s;gui&s;ed under the Ap|pearance of &s;ome other Di&s;temper; as enor|mous Vomitings, griping Loo&s;ene&s;&s;es, Cho|lera

<P>The Bark is certainly a mo&s;t noble Re|medy in many Ca&s;es; and notwith&s;tanding &s;ome ingenious Gentlemen have pointed out a Way to an&s;wer all its U&s;es by other Re|medies, endued (as they &s;ay) with as good, if not better, Properties; yet I believe, eve|ry Practitioner, who has had a thorough Ex|perience of its Efficacy in many Di&s;ea&s;es, will readily acknowledge, that nothing has hitherto been di&s;covered equal to it: And that late Di&s;covery, in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> of its mo&s;t admirable Effect in Mortifications, may be &s;ufficient to convince &s;uch Sceptics, that their darling Hypothe&s;es not agreeing with Facts, are but Cobweb Schemes, calculated rather to amu&s;e, than to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;olid and la&s;ting Practice.</P>
<P>All Hypothe&s;es, unle&s;s they agree with Facts, are delu&s;ive and vain; and I believe it will be readily granted, that had the Writers of this and former Ages confined

<P>What I have &s;aid is not to derogate from the Theory of Phy&s;ick, which is founded on Facts and proper Ob&s;ervations; and by which every particular Di&s;temper, with all its Symptoms and Accidents, may be ac|counted for; becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Man to judge from &s;uch and &s;uch Symptoms, what the Method of Cure ought to be in this or that Di&s;ea&s;e, unle&s;s he has an Idea of the Cau&s;es and Manner of their Production. A true Phy&s;ician, therefore, goes always warily to Work, and proceeds upon a ju&s;t and &s;olid Foundation; for he fir&s;t gets a Knowledge of the Seat and Cau&s;e of a Di&s;order, and at the&s;e he levels his Pre&s;cription. If the Ca&s;e proves ob&s;tinate, he augments the Force of his Medicines, and varies them as Circum&s;tances alter, without acknowledging an End to his Art, where the Di&s;ea&s;e is curable: For he has always &s;ome promi&s;ing Remedy in Re&s;erve,
<PB N="20" REF="005553_0028_101866499C92AE98">
and can, from Rules of Analogy, directly attempt the Removal of Di&s;ea&s;es un&s;een be|fore. A Per&s;on, on the contrary, who is ignorant of the <HI>Animal OEconomy,</HI> and the many other Requi&s;ites in Phy&s;ic, is puzzled and confounded at every Accident which turns up, and a new Ca&s;e throws him quite out of his Bia&s;s; for having but few Remedies to tru&s;t to, he directs them at all Adventures, without pur&s;uing any form|ed De&s;ign, or without regarding the Seat, the Cau&s;e, or Stage of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and the Circum&s;tances of the Patient. If happily his Medicines &s;ucceed, it is well; but if they fail, he is at the Extent of his Cord, he has done his utmo&s;t, and your Ca&s;e is de&s;perate: But thrice happy is the Patient, if he e&s;capes without having either his Con|&s;titution or Life de&s;troyed, through the Pre|tender's Ignorance and Ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>

CASE I.</P>
<P>A young Man, of eighteen or nineteen Years of Age, having been &s;eized with the <HI>Dry-Gripes,</HI> was treated in the u&s;ual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with &s;trong &s;timulating Purges and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|&s;ters, for about a Week before I was called to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but in&s;tead of relieving him, they had &s;trongly aggravated all the Symptoms. At my coming he had a rack|ing Pain in his Stomach and Bowels, and &s;uch frequent Strainings to vomit, as to ca&s;t up every Thing he took. His Pains were &s;ometimes &s;o exceeding &s;harp, that two or three Per&s;ons could &s;carcely keep him in Bed; and after every &s;uch &s;harp Fit, he could not &s;ee for near a Quarter of an Hour. As, therefore, Opiates could not be kept in his Stomach, I ordered him to take the already mentioned Powder of vitriolat|ed Tartar every Hour in Mint-Tea, which always &s;uppre&s;&s;es the Vomiting, where A|nodynes fail.</P>
<P>After taking three Do&s;es his Stomach be|came &s;o well &s;ettled, as to take the follow|ing Draught.</P>

<P>About an Hour afterwards I pre&s;cribed the Powders of Cream of Tartar; and at the &s;ame time ordered his Abdomen to be well fomented with the Fomentation.</P>
<P>After u&s;ing the Fomentation, and taking &s;everal Do&s;es of the Powders, the Pains fell down into the lower Parts of the Abdo|men; I, therefore, ordered him to take the purging Powder with Jalap every two Hours in any Vehicle.</P>
<P>But after taking three of tho&s;e Powders, he became &s;o impatient for Want of a Stool, that I ordered the following Cly&s;ter:</P>

This operating three of four times, brought away a large Quantity of Excre|ments.</P>
<P>To keep him tolerably ea&s;y the Ano|dynes were repeated three of four times every Twenty-four Hours, tho' in &s;maller Do&s;es.</P>
<P>To keep his Body temperately open, the la&s;t Powders were continued five or &s;ix Days. At length, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Elixir Proprietatis,</HI> and the bitter Infu&s;ion, he was perfectly recovered.</P>
<P>CASE II.</P>
<P>An old Man, near Seventy, was &s;eized with this Di&s;temper about a Month before I was &s;ent for: He had no Vomiting, and his Pains, tho' very &s;harp, were not &s;o a|cute as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>I gave him, as &s;oon as I came, <HI>Opii &s;e|&s;quigranum,</HI> and afterwards the Powders of Cream of Tartar. Next Morning I was &s;ent for very early, and found him in a Convul|&s;ion; but as it went off, I repeated the O|piate, and continued the U&s;e of the Pow|ders. In the Evening of the following Day,
<PB N="24" REF="005553_0032_101866558D09A198">
the Pains being removed to the lower Parts of the Abdomen, I ordered a Cly&s;ter, and by ob&s;erving the Method mentioned in the la&s;t Ca&s;e, he got well in a few Days.</P>
<P>CASE III.</P>
<P>A Man, about Twenty Years of Age, was attacked by the <HI>Dry-Gripes</HI> above three Weeks before I &s;aw him, and had taken (as I was informed) during that Time, near Twenty Purges and Cly&s;ters. The Pains were exce&s;&s;ively &s;harp in the Pit of the Stomach, as well as in the Inte&s;tines; and he was frequently &s;o convul&s;ed, that two or three Per&s;ons could &s;carcely keep him down. He was once &s;o di&s;tracted with the Violence of the Pain, that he was with Difficulty prevented from throwing him&s;elf out of the Chamber Window.</P>
<P>I gave him <HI>Liquid. Laud. Syd. Guttas quinquaginta,</HI> which in a few Hours abated the Violence of his Pains. In &s;hort, by pur&s;uing the Method already laid down, he got the better of the Di&s;ea&s;e in about three Days Time. But his Stomach and Bowels were &s;o very &s;ore afterwards, that he could
<PB N="25" REF="005553_0033_1018665A54158290">
hardly &s;uffer any Thing to touch them. This indeed I have commonly ob&s;erved, where the Pains have been very violent.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to recite any more Ca&s;es, the&s;e being &s;ufficient to give a perfect Idea of the <HI>Modus Medendi</HI> to Practitioners.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now, to &s;hew the pernicious Con|&s;equence of giving Quick&s;ilver in this Di|&s;temper, relate the Ca&s;e of a Per&s;on in one of the Ho&s;pitals in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>A Man about forty Years old had the <HI>Dry-Gripes</HI> &s;everal Weeks, before he was taken into the Ho&s;pital. He had continual Reachings to vomit, and violent Pains in his Belly, which was prodigiou&s;ly &s;welled and hard. The Phy&s;ician attending the Ho&s;pi|tal pre&s;cribed very frequently Cly&s;ters and Purges of <HI>Aq. Purgant. cum mana, et Sal. mirab. Glaub.</HI> and other Remedies. At la&s;t, when he found the Patient not in the lea&s;t relieved, but rather wor&s;e, he ordered him to take Six Ounces of Quick&s;ilver at a Time, which was repeated, till the Quantity amounted to 18 Ounces. This Method, however, was &s;o far from recovering the Patient, that the Symptoms increa&s;ing, he
<PB N="26" REF="005553_0034_1018665D505CEF30">
died after enduring the mo&s;t racking Pains, for the &s;pace of eight Weeks.</P>
<P>Having open'd his Body, the next Day after his Death, I found the Inte&s;tines very much di&s;tended with Wind, but little or no Excrements. In his Stomach, which was very much contracted and &s;hrivel'd up, I found fourteen Ounces of the Quick&s;ilver he had taken eight Days before, mixt with about half a Pint of vi&s;cid Matter.</P>
<P>Hence we learn, how long Quick&s;ilver may remain in the Stomach, e&s;pecially when the Fibres have lo&s;t their proper Tone; &s;ince in this Ca&s;e the contractile Power of of the Stomach mu&s;t have been exerted with a prodigious Force, in order to have thrown &s;uch a Weight from the Bottom of the Sto|mach over &s;uch an A&s;cent as the <HI>Pylorus.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;ome Per&s;ons have a great Opinion of the U&s;e of crude Quick&s;ilver in curing the <HI>Dry-Gripes,</HI> as well as many other Di&s;ea|&s;es, I &s;hall here, to &s;hew how unphilo&s;o|phical &s;uch Gentlemen are, give you Dr. <HI>Quincey'</HI>s Rea&s;oning upon the Article of Quick&s;ilver:&mdash;<Q>It is (&s;ays he) frequently talked of indeed, as good in &s;ome Affec|tions of the Bowels; but there are very
<PB N="27" REF="005553_0035_1018665F2D2AAEE0">
few In&s;tances of its U&s;e in &s;uch Ca&s;es. Nor can that at all appear rea&s;onable, which is commonly reported of its quick Pa&s;&s;age through the Body; for the Argu|ments which the Favourers of &s;uch Re|ports make u&s;e of, are quite again&s;t them; that is, its prodigious Weight: For when it fir&s;t comes into the Stomach, it cannot but fall to the Bottom; which is &s;o much below the <HI>Pylorus,</HI> that a va&s;t Force mu&s;t be required to throw it over into the In|te&s;tines; and when it comes there, by their manifold Convolutions, it very fre|quently mu&s;t a&s;cend, and particularly while it pa&s;&s;es the Colon: So that it is hardly conceivable, how a Body of &s;o great a Weight can be lifted over &s;o many A&s;cents, as it nece&s;&s;arily comes at, be|tween the <HI>OE&s;ophagus</HI> and the <HI>Rectum.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If Dr. <HI>Quincey'</HI>s Rea&s;ons are convincing, how much &s;tronger mu&s;t be the Objection again&s;t the U&s;e of Quick&s;ilver, in Ca&s;es where the Stomach and Bowels are relaxed and weakened; the Fibres being then cer|tainly le&s;s capable of exerting their con|tractile Force to rai&s;e any Weight; which is certainly the Ca&s;e, when a Per&s;on has
<PB N="28" REF="005553_0036_1018666269525E80">
laboured under &s;uch a violent Di&s;temper as the <HI>Dry-Gripes</HI> for a con&s;iderable Time.</P>
<P>I have &s;een in <HI>England</HI> two In&s;tances of the Succe&s;s attending the Method here laid down for the <HI>Dry-Gripes</HI> in the <HI>Cholica Pi|ctonum,</HI> ari&s;ing from the Fumes of White-lead; which gives me Rea&s;on to hope, that by a farther Trial of it in <HI>Europe,</HI> it would be found as beneficial in the latter Di&s;tem|per, as it is in the former.</P>
<P>We frequently ob&s;erve Per&s;ons in the <HI>Dry-Gripes</HI> to lo&s;e the U&s;e of their Limbs (the Ancles and Wri&s;ts becoming exceeding weak, and the Balls of their Thumbs &s;ink|ing) either by the Acrimony of the Hu|mours, or the U&s;e of &s;trong Stimu|lants; by which means the fine nervous Sy&s;tem being wounded and debilitated, the Equilibrium between the Solids and Fluids is de&s;troyed.&mdash;In &s;uch a relaxed State of the Solids, the Blood mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become vi&s;cid; for the Fibres having lo&s;t their ela|&s;tic Force, the Circulation of the Fluids is dimini&s;hed, and con&s;equently they run into preternatural Cohe&s;ions. The giving, there|fore, a greater Degree of Fluidity to the Blood, and a proper Ten&s;ity or Springine&s;s

<P>All Per&s;ons of weak, relaxed Nerves, &s;hould avoid a moi&s;t and foggy Air, which would nece&s;&s;arily render their Fibres &s;till more lax and flaccid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Effects produced in the human Body by a hea|vy or light Atmo&s;phere, and according as it is affected by Cold, Heat, Moi&s;ture, or Dryne&s;s, were fully and clear|ly explained in the Philo&s;ophical Lectures exhibited by Dr. <HI>Spencer</HI> in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> la&s;t Summer; which, as I am in|formed, will be &s;peedily publi&s;hed.;</NOTE> but let them re&s;ide in a cold, clear Air, which will give a greater Degree of Ten&s;ity and Ela&s;ticity to the Solids.

The <HI>Linimentum Paralyti|cum,</HI> which is well known in <HI>England,</HI> ought likewi&s;e to be well rubbed in, down the Back, and on the Limbs, twice a Day.

u&s;e purgative Evacuations to di&s;burden op|pre&s;&s;ed Nature at proper Sea&s;ons, or before the Di&s;ea&s;e begins to gather Strength; flat|tering them&s;elves that all is well and &s;afe within, as long as nothing appears outward|ly, or is felt by them to the contrary. He, therefore, that is de&s;irous of pre&s;erving his Sen&s;es and rational Faculties in the greate&s;t Perfection, and of being able to act with a &s;prightly Vigour and lively Apprehen|&s;ion, mu&s;t beware of &s;purring Nature on beyond her Craving.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Let &s;uch Valetudinarians u&s;e the Fle&s;h-Bru&s;h, moderate Exerci&s;e, without rai&s;ing Sweat, and frequent polite and chearful Company. Mu&s;ic may likewi&s;e be of great Service in &s;uch Ca&s;es; for every Stroke of a mu&s;ical In&s;trument cau&s;es an Undulation of the Air, which giving &s;ome Degree of Concu&s;&s;ion to the Fibres of the Body, without over&s;training them, produ|ces a bri&s;ker Circulation of the Blood; and con&s;equently invigorates the Nerves, and le&s;&s;ens the Vi&s;cidity of the Fluids. The extraordinary and almo&s;t incredible Effects of Mu&s;ic in curing the Bite of the <HI>Taran|tula,</HI> the World is no Stranger to. If the&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="005553_0042_10186674385BB818">
Advantages from Mu&s;ic were more particu|larly con&s;idered, it might perhaps be applied to very noble Purpo&s;es, and not (as &s;ome imagine) to enervate the Mind; for as a di&s;tempered Body is often the Cau&s;e of a di&s;ordered Mind, it may, by acting on the Solids, be the Means of regulating our Pa&s;|&s;ions, and bringing our Minds to a proper Degree of Calmne&s;s and Serenity. Thus <HI>Saul,</HI> who was without Doubt of a melan|choly Di&s;po&s;ition, frequently &s;oothed his troubled Mind, and rai&s;ed his drooping Spirits, by the Force of <HI>David'</HI>s Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>I will now &s;ubjoin a few Forms of Me|dicines, which I generally make u&s;e of in a relaxed State of the Nerves, but more e&s;pe|cially in Autumn, when we are mo&s;t &s;ub|ject to the Di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from a debili|tated Fibre; for in that Sea&s;on of the Year, our Bodies being relaxed by the Heat of the Day, are more liable to the Mi&s;chiefs of the &s;udden Coldne&s;s of the Evenings, Nights and Mornings. Be&s;ides, <HI>Sanctorius</HI> has ob|&s;erved, that from the Autumnal Equinox, to the Winter-Sol&s;tice, our Per&s;piration is, one Day with another, about one Pound le&s;s; and this Diminution is &s;till &s;o much
<PB N="35" REF="005553_0043_10186677691C46D8">
the more, as our Ve&s;&s;els have been more relaxed by the Summer's Heat; for they then cannot with Force enough propel the contained Fluids, which con&s;equently mu&s;t every Day contract a greater Degree of Lentor and Vi&s;cidity.&mdash;It is, therefore, no Wonder, that many unwary Per&s;ons are la|bouring under Di&s;ea&s;es in Autumn, &s;eeing their Humours are then more than ordina|ry acrid, as well as their Per&s;piration very much dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, evident, that the <HI>Pro|phylactic</HI> Method in that Sea&s;on of the Year, is to &s;trengthen the Fibres, and pre|&s;erve a proper Fluidity in the Blood; that the ordinary Per&s;piration may be kept up in a proper, con&s;tant, and uniform Man|ner.&mdash;The following Medicines an&s;wer &s;uch an Intention in this Climate, and act as <HI>Al|terants;</HI> for every Thing which does not operate in the fir&s;t, but farthe&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, the Phy&s;icians commonly include under that general Appellation. I think, how|ever, that a few gentle and proper Purges ought fir&s;t to be taken, in order to evacu|ate the redundant acrid Bile, which kind

<P>The Ingredients joined with the Bark in the&s;e Tinctures give an agreeable Warmth and Scent, which is very grateful to a Sto|mach weakened and palled by a Fever and Medicines. The &s;aline and re&s;inous Parts of the Bark, being intimately united with the Liquor, are thus given with much greater Advantage, than can be by giving it in Sub&s;tance: For when it is given in the fine&s;t Powders, which can po&s;&s;ibly be obtained from the Mortar and Sieve, it is yet too coar&s;e for a weakened Con&s;titution, and therefore frequently brings on a <HI>Diar|rhaea</HI> by its Stimulus; but in Tincture or Decoction, it is too fine to give any Di|&s;turbance in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, and not on|ly pa&s;&s;es, by the common Cour&s;e of Cir|culation, much farther, but gives a more uniform and general Contraction to the de|bilitated and relaxed Fibres.</P>

<HEAD>AN EXTRAORDINARY CASE IN PHYSICK.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Account being at|tended with &s;ome very uncommon Circum&s;tances, I thought it would not be improper to make a full Enquiry in|to the Particulars, of which I was fir&s;t in|formed by &s;everal Per&s;ons of Credit.</P>
<P>The Wife of one <HI>B. S.</HI> who had been a healthy, lively Woman, and the Mother of two Children, was &s;eized, in the Year 1738, with a <HI>Diabetes,</HI> and the u&s;ual Symp|toms, <HI>viz.</HI> a frequent and copious Di&s;|charge by Urine, a gradual Wa&s;ting of the Body, a Hectic Fever, with a quick, low Pul&s;e, Thir&s;t, great Pains in her Shoulders, Back and Limbs, and Lo&s;s of Appetite. She continued in this Manner two Years,
<PB N="39" REF="005553_0047_101866840BA47FD0">
notwith&s;tanding the U&s;e of Medicines u&s;u|ally pre&s;cribed in &s;uch Ca&s;es, but much emaciated. She was then attacked with an <HI>Intermitting Fever,</HI> which &s;oon left her; and after this the <HI>Diabetes</HI> gradually de|crea&s;ed; &s;o that in a few Months &s;he was intirely free from that Di&s;order; but the Pains in her Limbs &s;till continued. She re|covered her Appetite very well, breathed freely, and her <HI>Hectic Fever</HI> was very much le&s;&s;ened, tho' &s;he &s;ometimes had Exacerba|tions of the &s;ame. About the Beginning of Winter, 1740, &s;he had &s;uch a Weakne&s;s and Pain in her Limbs, as to confine her to Bed altogether; and in a few Months af|terwards the Bones in her Legs and Arms felt &s;omewhat &s;oft to the Touch, and were &s;o pliable, as to be bent into a Curve; nay, for &s;everal Months before her Death, they were as limber as a Rag, and would bend any way with le&s;s Difficulty than the mu&s;|cular Parts of a healthy Per&s;on's Leg, with|out the Interpo&s;ition of the Bones.</P>
<P>The 12th of <HI>April,</HI> 1742, &s;he died, be|ing then near the Age of Forty; and, hav|ing the Con&s;ent of her Friends, I had the Curio&s;ity to examine the Body. Upon rai|&s;ing
<PB N="40" REF="005553_0048_10186688C5D243D0">
the <HI>Cutis,</HI> I found the <HI>Membrana Adi|po&s;a</HI> much thicker than I expected in a Per|&s;on &s;o much emaciated; the <HI>Sternum</HI> and Ribs, with their Cartilages, very &s;oft; and all the cartilaginous Productions of the <HI>Ribs</HI> on the Left-&s;ide doubled over one another, about an Inch long, in this Form Z, but flatter. Upon rai&s;ing the <HI>Sternum,</HI> I found the <HI>Lungs</HI> adhering very clo&s;e to the <HI>Pleu|ra</HI> on each Side, but more loo&s;e and flac|cid, and much le&s;s in Size than u&s;ual. Her <HI>Heart</HI> was of the common Bigne&s;s, and upon viewing her <HI>Liver,</HI> I found it at lea&s;t a third Part bigger than ordinary. Her <HI>Spleen</HI> was about an Inch and a Half in the longe&s;t Part, and about a Quarter of an Inch thick, and the <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI> were very much inflated.</P>
<P>She had Appearances of &s;everal <HI>Anchylo|&s;es</HI> formed in the &s;mall Joynts, <HI>viz. carpal</HI> and <HI>Metacarpal</HI> Bones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which had been without Motion for &s;everal Months; but upon laying them open, I found they were only like a thin Shell. The cartilagi|nous <HI>Epiphy&s;es</HI> of the Bones were intirely di&s;&s;olved, and no Part of the Heads remain|ing, but an Out&s;ide, not thicker than an
<PB N="41" REF="005553_0049_1018668A8413FDB8">
Egg-&s;hell. Upon making Inci&s;ions in her Legs and Arms of five or &s;ix Inches long, I found the outer <HI>Laminae</HI> of the Bones &s;oft, and perfectly membranous, about the Thick|ne&s;s of the <HI>Peritonaeum;</HI> and containing (in&s;tead of a boney Sub&s;tance) a Fluid of the Con&s;i&s;tence of Honey when thick, and of a reddi&s;h Colour, but not at all di&s;agree|ble to the Smell. There was, however, an Appearance of Bones near the Joynts of her Legs and Arms, tho' in part di&s;&s;olved; but what remained was very &s;oft, and full of large Holes, like a Honey-comb. The Bones of the Head yielded ea&s;ily to the Pre&s;&s;ure of my Finger. It may &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ing, that tho&s;e Parts of the Bones, which are the mo&s;t compact and hard, &s;hould be di&s;&s;olv|ed, while their Heads, which are more &s;pongy and &s;oft, had not altogether lo&s;t their Sub&s;tance.&mdash;She was, when in Health, five Foot high, as I was informed by her Hu&s;band; but having mea&s;ured her after Death, &s;he was no more than three Foot &s;e|ven Inches in Length, tho' all her Limbs were &s;tretched out &s;trait.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere.</HI> Whether a corro&s;ive, <HI>acid</HI> State of the Fluids, might not have been the

Cau&s;e of this uncommon Di&s;&s;olution of the Bones?

<P>Suppo&s;ing therefore a corro&s;ive, <HI>acid</HI> State of the Fluids, to have been the proxi|mate Cau&s;e; <HI>Quaere,</HI> Whether an <HI>alcaline</HI> Regimen, timely pur&s;ued, would not have been the mo&s;t likely Method to have &s;uc|ceeded in this poor Woman's Ca&s;e?</P>
