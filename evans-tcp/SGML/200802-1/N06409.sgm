<BIBL>ISAIAH, Chap. xxxii. 1, 2.</BIBL>
<Q>Behold, <HI>a King</HI> &s;hall Reign in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and <HI>Princes</HI> &s;hall Rule in Judgment. And <HI>a Man</HI> &s;hall be as an hiding Place from the Wind, and a Covert from the Tempe&s;t: as Rivers of Water in a dry Place, as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</Q>

<P>_THERE is no Part of the Bible that more de&s;erves the Thoughts of inqui&s;itive Men, than the Writings of the Pro|phets; and Per&s;ons of very high En|dowments, may find &s;ufficient Em|ploynemt in unfolding the Types and Figures of the Jewi&s;h OEconomy, and in &s;earching into the Depths of the Prophetical Predictions. And the metaphorical Style of the Prophets is very proper to in&s;pire the Minds of the Attentive, with noble Ideas of God's Wi&s;dom and Providence, and to
<PB N="3" REF="008135_0006_102E36158C6ADD10">
affect us with the mo&s;t lively Image of the glori|ous Kingdom of God and Chri&s;t, the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e that &s;hall have a Share in the Triumphs of it, and the Terriblene&s;s of the Puni&s;hments which are denounced again&s;t &s;uch as will not have Him to Rule over them.</P>
<P>The Books of the Prophets unfold the Methods of Providence in many remarkable In&s;tances.&mdash;Such as&mdash;God's Di&s;po&s;al of Kingdoms and Go|vernments, and making U&s;e of wicked Princes and Nations to be the In&s;truments of his Ju&s;tice in puni&s;hing others, as bad or wor&s;e&mdash;The gradual Di&s;covery of the Coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the &s;everal Steps and Advancements by which God introduced his Kingdom into the World, and will &s;till carry it on, 'till the Con&s;ummation of all Things.&mdash;And there is a Trea&s;ure of heavenly Wi&s;dom contained in the Writings of the Prophets, that can never be exhau&s;ted; and 'tis mo&s;t rea&s;o|nable to believe that &s;ome Parts of the&s;e Prophe|cies reach to the End of the World; and 'tis al|&s;o rea&s;onable to expect, that in every Age, Provi|dence &s;hould open &s;ome new Scene, which will give further In&s;ight into the Meaning of the&s;e &s;a|cred Books.&mdash;And to extend the Prophetic Views to the End of the World, &s;eems mo&s;t agreable to that De&s;cription of God's Pre&s;cience, which is gi|ven us in <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> Ch. 46. <HI>ver.</HI> 10. viz. That He <HI>declares the End from the Beginning.</HI>&mdash;So that even when the whole My&s;tery of God's Di&s;pen&s;ations &s;hall be fini&s;hed, it will appear that Nothing is contained in them, but what God hath formerly declared to his Servants the Prophets; as 'tis ex|pre&s;ly affirmed, <HI>Rev.</HI> 10. 7.</P>

<HI>I&s;aiah</HI> de&s;ervedly holds the fir&s;t Rank in that noble Order of Prophets; as he foretells the future State of the Church more frequently and fully than the others, and in the loftie&s;t Language, and bolde&s;t Metaphors.&mdash;His &s;upernatural Gift of Prophecy added a new Lu&s;tre to the greatne&s;s of his Birth, and his liberal Education furni&s;hed him with a noble Eloquence, and &s;uitable to the Dig|nity of his Argument.&mdash;"His Style is great, noble, &s;ublime &amp; florid: He paints Things to the Life, but with the &s;tronge&s;t and livelie&s;t Strokes."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dupin</HI> Can.

<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that the Commentaries on this Prophet fall &s;hort of a full Explication of his Book, on Account of his Profoundne&s;s of Tho't, Loftine&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion, and Extent of Prophecy; and therefore may it not be &s;aid, that I, &s;o infe|riour in divine Knowledge, need an Apology for attempting a Sermon on &s;o remarkable a Pa&s;&s;age of his Prophecy as my Text, e&s;pecially on this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, and before &s;o great and learned and honourable an A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lived and prophe&s;ied under four Kings of Judah, <HI>Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah</HI>&mdash;If we &s;uppo&s;e (for 'tis not certain) that the Prophe|cies &amp;c. of this Book are put in the &s;ame Order in which they were at fir&s;t written &amp; publi&s;hed, the Book may be divided into four Parts or Secti|ons. The five Chapters from the Beginning, con|tain the Prophecies which he made in the Time of <HI>Uzziah.</HI>&mdash;The Vi&s;ion of the &s;ixth Chapter hap|pened in <HI>Jotham'</HI>s Reign; and the following Chap|ters from the &s;eventh to the thirty fifth inclu&s;ive|ly, contain his Prophecies under the Reign of
<PB N="5" REF="008135_0008_102E3619960EAEC8">
<HI>Ahaz.</HI>&mdash;And then follows an Account of <HI>Sennache|rib'</HI>s Inva&s;ion, <HI>Hezekiah'</HI>s Sickne&s;s &amp; Recovery, <HI>Chap.</HI> 36, 37, 38. (that Hi&s;tory being a Key to open &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in the foregoing Prophecies) with a brief Prediction of the Jews Captivity by the Babylonians, on Occa&s;ion of the King of Baby|lon's Amba&s;&s;age to <HI>Hezekiah</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>Chap.</HI> 39.&mdash;And the 40th Chap. and tho&s;e that follow to the End of the Book, do not only concern the Jews Return from Babylon, and the Re&s;toration and E&s;tabli&s;hment of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Political State, but al&s;o the Call of the Gentiles, the King|dom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and flouri&s;hing State of the Church under his Government, and the Prophet de&s;cribes the future Glories of the Church, with a Loftine&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion &s;uitable to the Dignity of the Subject.</P>
<P>And not only in this la&s;t Section, but al&s;o in the preceeding Parts of this Book, the Prophet in fore|telling and de&s;cribing &s;undry remarkable Events relating to the Jewi&s;h Nation, takes Occa&s;ion to &s;et forth the &s;everal Advances of Chri&s;t's Kingdom in after-Times. And the glorious State of the Church towards the End of the World, when the Fulne&s;s of the Jews and Gentiles &s;hall come into the Church, is evidently predicted in the former Part of <HI>Ch.</HI> 2. and in 6, 7, 8, 9. &vers;. of the 11th <HI>Ch.</HI> and that inimitable De&s;cription of the new Face of Things, in <HI>Ch.</HI> 35. cannot with Propriety be ap|plied, in its utmo&s;t Latitude, to any other than the <HI>Golden Age</HI> of the Go&s;pel, or <HI>Millennial State.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophecies which foretell the Vi&s;ibility and Univer&s;ality of Chri&s;t's Church, accompanied with perfect Peace, Pro&s;perity &amp; Holine&s;s, cannot with
<PB N="6" REF="008135_0009_102E361CFA46BB50">
any Probability, be &s;aid to have as yet received their Accompli&s;hment, as, neither have tho&s;e Pre|dictions, which fore&s;hew the flouri&s;hing State of the Jewi&s;h Church &amp; Nation in the latter Times.</P>
<P>Moreover, 'tis to be ob&s;erved, that under the Old Te&s;tament, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons and Tran&s;actions there mentioned, were typical, and prefigured the State of Things under the Me&s;&s;ias. In the Characters given us in the Old Te&s;tament of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua, David</HI> and <HI>Solomon, Cyrus</HI> and <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rubbabel,</HI> and others I might mention, <HI>they</HI> are plainly de&s;cribed as Figures of Chri&s;t, &s;everal Cir|cum&s;tances of their Lives did fore&s;hew the mo&s;t remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages of his Life, &amp; the Deliveran|ces &s;ome of them wrought for God's People, were Earne&s;ts of a greater Redemption to be accom|pli&s;hed by the Me&s;&s;ias: And from hence we may conclude, that there is a Re&s;emblance or Corre&s;|pondence between many of the Tran&s;actions men|tioned in the Old Te&s;tament, and tho&s;e which &s;hould come to pa&s;s under the New; and con&s;e|quently, that the Prophets when they &s;pake of &s;ome Events near their own Times, probably had more di&s;tant Views, which might reach even to the latter Ages of the World. And it &s;eems to have been a Maxim, in interpreting Prophecies, received among the Jews before Chri&s;t's Time, that whenever they ob&s;erved an imperfect Completion of a Prophecy in the hi&s;torical Event, which no way an&s;wered the lofty Expre&s;&s;ions, and exten&s;ive Promi&s;es, which the natural Sen&s;e of the Text imported, then they &s;uppo&s;ed the Times of the Me&s;&s;iah to be ultimately intended, in whom all the Promi&s;es of God are Yea and Amen.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008135_0010_102E3620AF9EE718">
And among this kind of Prophecies, <HI>this thirty|&s;econd Chapter of I&s;aiah,</HI> is an eminent Example, e&s;pecially the former Part of it, in particular the Ver&s;es of my Text, and the two following Ver&s;es&mdash;</P>
<P>My Text, in the primary Sen&s;e, is to be under|&s;tood of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and the Princes or Magi&s;trates under him. The Character of that excellent Prince, and the &s;ubordinate Rulers, is here exhi|bited; but there are &s;everal Expre&s;&s;ions, <Q>parti|cularly tho&s;e in the 3d &amp; 4th Ver&s;es, that relate to happier Times than <HI>Hezekiah</HI> ever lived to &s;ee, and therefore we may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that the Reformation made by <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> was but a Sha|dow or Image of tho&s;e greater Improvements in Grace and Holine&s;s, which properly belong to the Go&s;pel Times, under the Government of Chri&s;t, and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit. <HI>And the Eyes of them that &s;ee, &s;hall not be dim, and the Ears of them that hear, &s;hall hearken&mdash;The Heart al&s;o of the Ra&s;h &s;hall under&s;tand Knowlege, &amp; the Tongue of the Stammerers &s;hall be ready to &s;peak plainly.</HI></Q> God &s;hall plentifully afford the Light of his Truth, and give them Grace to make a good U&s;e of the In&s;tructions he vouch&s;afes unto them. Tho&s;e that are weak in Faith &s;hall come to more perfect Degrees of Knowlege; and the mo&s;t rude and illiterate, &s;uch as could not &s;peak &s;o as to be under&s;tood, &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e clearly &amp; intelligibly of God and of their Duty;&mdash;the barbarous Nations being converted to Chri&s;t, &s;hall give Prai&s;es to God in their &s;everal Languages."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Lowth'</HI>s Comment.</NOTE></P>
<P>And indeed my Text and Context have never yet been fulfilled, &s;ince the Coming of Chri&s;t, in
<PB N="8" REF="008135_0011_102E3623283B3990">
their mo&s;t &s;ublime Sen&s;e, nor &s;hall be, until the Millennial State advances, when the Kingdoms of this World &s;hall become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chri&s;t. And therefore there is not only a <HI>primary</HI> but a <HI>&s;econdary Sen&s;e</HI> of the Pro|phet to be attended: To which may be added, with Propriety, <HI>an accommodated Sen&s;e,</HI> the particu|lar Illu&s;tration whereof will compri&s;e all I propo&s;e to offer from my Text on this great Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I. This Prophecy of a King to Reign in Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and Princes to Rule in Judgment, is <HI>primarily applicable to King</HI> Hezekiah, <HI>and the Prime Mini&s;ters of State under him,</HI> and was fulfilled in Him and Them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t King of I&s;rael by God's Permi&s;&s;ion and De&s;ignation was <HI>Saul.</HI> Till this Time, God had governed the Nation by Judges, whom He rai&s;ed up, &amp; extraordinarily in&s;pired, when he &s;aw Occa&s;ion. He re&s;erved to him&s;elf the &s;ole Power of e&s;tabli&s;hing Laws, appointing Magi&s;trates, and making War.&mdash;<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> (in his Book again&s;t <HI>Apion</HI>) makes the Government of the I&s;raelites before they had a King different from all other, which he calls by a new Name &THgr;&Egr;&Ogr;&Kgr;&Rgr;&Agr;&Tgr;&Igr;&Agr; (a Greek Word made by him to expre&s;s the &s;ame) <HI>Theocracy,</HI> that is, the Government of God. For God exerci&s;ed the &s;upreme Authority among them by his ex|pre&s;s Command.</P>
<P>On Occa&s;ion of the bad Conduct of <HI>Samuel'</HI>s Sons (their taking Bribes &amp; perverting Judgment) the Elders of I&s;rael came to <HI>Samuel,</HI> and demand|ed a King to be &s;et over them, like the other Na|tions, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> Ch. 8. ver. 1,&mdash;4. God is offended
<PB N="9" REF="008135_0012_102E3624D4E75950">
at it as an interpretative throwing off his Autho|rity, who was their King, but tells <HI>Samuel</HI> to con|&s;ent to their Demand, &vers;. 7. at the &s;ame Time, ordering him to &s;hew them the Manner of the King that &s;hould reign over them, &vers;. 9. (which <HI>Samuel</HI> faithfully relates to the Elders, &vers;. 11&mdash;17.) that they might know what Kind of Government they cho&s;e in Stead of God's. <HI>Samuel</HI> from God gives them a De&s;cription of a mo&s;t arbitrary and tyrannical Government, &s;uch as the Kings of the Nations had acquired, for they de&s;ired &s;uch a King as their Neighbours had, who were all under the ab&s;olute Dominion of their Princes, which is called by <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> (Politic. Lib. 5.) a De&s;potick Government.</P>
<P>The People of I&s;rael had hitherto lived under Governours, rai&s;ed up by Divine In&s;tinct, who had exacted no Tribute from them, nor put them to any Charges. With which Government they being not contented, but de&s;iring to have a King like other Nations, that &s;hould live in Pomp and Splendor, and keep &s;tanding Forces about him, to be ready to re&s;i&s;t any Inva&s;ion: <HI>Samuel</HI> informs them, what it was they de&s;ired, that they might con&s;ider, when they under&s;tood it, whether they would per&s;i&s;t in their Choice: If they would have a King magnificently attended, then he tells them, the King will take their Sons, and put them in his Chariots, &amp;c. &vers;. 11. If they would have him keep up con&s;tant Forces, then he mu&s;t appoint them for Colonels and Captains, and employ tho&s;e in his Wars, who were wont to follow their Fa|mily-Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>ver.</HI> 12. And &s;ince after the Man|ner of other Kings, he mu&s;t keep a &s;tately Court,
<PB N="10" REF="008135_0013_102E36265F93A610">
they mu&s;t be content that their Daughters, (<HI>ver.</HI> 13.) &s;hould &s;erve in &s;everal Offices; which the King would think below the Dignity of his Wives and Daughters. Many Mini&s;ters al&s;o in &s;everal Employments both in War &amp; Peace, mu&s;t have Salaries to &s;upport them, which mu&s;t be paid out of their Fields and Vineyards, <HI>ver.</HI> 14. For which Services, he tells them, the King will expect the Tenth of all belonging to them, that he may main|tain his Royal Expences, <HI>ver.</HI> 15, 16, 17. In one Word, if they will have a King, he mu&s;t be main|tained, after a royal Manner, out of their E&s;tates.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Puffendorf</HI> de Rebus Ge&s;tis Philippi in <HI>Patrick</HI>s Comment.</NOTE></P>
<P>Far be it from us to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Samuel</HI> here &s;peaks of a ju&s;t and hone&s;t Right of Kings to do the&s;e Things, for their Right is quite otherwi&s;e de&s;cribed in that Part of <HI>Mo&s;es'</HI>s Law, which con|cerns the King's Duty, in <HI>Deut Ch.</HI> 17. <HI>ver.</HI> 18, 19, 20. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> there commands, that the King, when he &s;at on the Throne, &s;hould write him a Copy of the Law in a Book from the Original, or authen|tick Copy in the Sanctuary, under the Cu&s;tody of the Prie&s;ts, and that he &s;hould diligently &s;tudy it, and learn his Duty therefrom, that he might be pre&s;erved in the true Religion, and be acquainted with his whole Duty, and perform it accordingly: not imagining him&s;elf to be above all Laws, nor &s;lighting his Subjects, but taking due Care to pro|mote their Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>God had given I&s;rael in the Wilderne&s;s, a Body of Moral Political and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws, when he formed them into a National Common-Wealth and Church, or Political and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, and their Kings are by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> enjoined to govern

<P>King <HI>Ahaz,</HI> the Father of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> was a very impious Prince, yet when the King of I&s;rael and the King of Syria, were in a Confederacy to cut off the Royal Family of Judah, God remembred his ancient Promi&s;es to <HI>David,</HI> and &s;ent <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> to a&s;&s;ure him, that their evil Coun&s;el &s;hould not &s;tand, or come to pa&s;s.

<P><HI>Ahaz,</HI> in&s;tead of being reformed by the Mercy of God in breaking the Confederacy of the two Kings, became more wicked than he was before, for he cleaved to the wor&s;t Abominations of the heathen Nations round about him. See 2 <HI>Chron. Ch.</HI> 28. <HI>ver.</HI> 2, 3, 4. And therefore God for his Puni&s;hment, brought upon him again the two confederated Kings, from whom he had delivered him the former Year, who made terrible Havock and De&s;truction.

After all this he continued hardened in his Impiety, and would not &s;eek to God, nor turn from his wicked Ways, but putting his Confidence in Man (and not in God) engaged the King of A&s;&s;yria, by a &s;acrilegious Pre&s;ent, to come for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, who rather di&s;tre&s;&s;ed than helped him.</P>
<P>After this, he gave him&s;elf up to Idolatry, and wor&s;hipped the Gods of the Syrians, as well as of the other Nations, and filled Jeru&s;alem and Ju|dah with Idols, and their Altars.</P>

<P>The King began his Reign with the Reforma|tion of Religion; he opened the Hou&s;e of God, and re&s;tored the true Wor&s;hip of God, according to the Divine Law; he ordered the Prie&s;ts and Levites to attend their Duty at the Temple. He cau&s;ed his Father's idolatrous Altar to be remov|ed,

and re&s;tored the Lord's Altar to it's Place, and purged the Temple of all other Pollutions, with which it had been prophaned.&mdash;The Hou&s;e of God being &s;anctified, the King, the Rulers and great Men of his Kingdom went thither, with the Peo|ple, and offered Sacrifices of Atonement &amp; Peace-Offerings.

<P>And now, having con&s;idered the primary Sen&s;e of my Text, in Application to King <HI>Hezekiah;</HI> it follows,</P>
<P>II. To &s;hew, that there is al&s;o a <HI>&s;econdary Sen&s;e</HI> of the Words to be attended, for the fuller Illu&s;tra|tion of them.</P>
<P>This <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> is very evident in a great many Prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament. It is called a <HI>&s;econdary Sen&s;e,</HI> not as if it were le&s;s principally intended by the Prophets, but rather with Re&s;pect to the Time, becau&s;e it is the la&s;t and ultimate Completion of their Predictions: Which is al&s;o called the <HI>my&s;tical</HI> or <HI>figurative Sen&s;e,</HI> by which is meant a more remote, but a natural and nece&s;&s;ary Signification, in Contradi&s;tinction to the <HI>literal</HI> or immediate Signification, which is a Type or Figure of the other. "All Types or Figures being to have a Re&s;pect to the Things figured; if we con&s;ider them as Figures, we &s;peak at the &s;ame Time of that which they repre&s;ent; &s;o that which is &s;aid, has nece&s;&s;arily two proper and natural Sen&s;es; one that agrees to the Figure, and another to the Thing figured: Sometimes the Figure is more evidently &s;poken of than the Thing figured, but &s;ometimes al&s;o &s;uch Words are purpo&s;ely cho&s;en, as agree better to the Thing figured than the Fi|gure, to &s;hew that what is &s;aid is but a Figure, and ought not to be re&s;ted in. The Old Te&s;ta|ment is a Figure of the New, and all tho&s;e Things which befell the Jews, were Figures of what|ever
<PB N="21" REF="008135_0024_102E3643062804F0">

<P>The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 11. <HI>Now all the&s;e Things happened un|to them for Examples,</HI> or Types or Figures (<GAP DESC="foreign">) according to the Greek, &s;peaking of I&s;rael's being under the Cloud, and pa&s;&s;ing thro' the Sea &amp;c. and their eating the Manna and drinking Water out of the Rock; all which were Types or Figures of Go&s;pel &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings. See <HI>ver.</HI> 1&mdash;4.</P>
<P>"But tho' the chief Per&s;ons, and principal E|vents of the old Te&s;tament are Figures, yet &s;ome are more evidently &s;uch, and others more ob&s;cure|ly; &s;ome are written only as Hi&s;tories, and left to be interpreted, and others are written &s;o that we may plainly &s;ee they are but Figures, and their Relation naturally and nece&s;&s;arily carries the Mind to &s;omething more lofty: Such are many of the Prophecies of the old Te&s;tament con|cerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Church: They are capable of two Sen&s;es, that of the Figure, and that of the Thing figured; this latter is not an arbi|trary, but a proper and nece&s;&s;ary Sen&s;e, becau&s;e the Words them&s;elves &s;hew that the De&s;ign of the Writer was to repre&s;ent by a Figure &s;ome|thing more &s;ublime. As for Example, when the Kingdom of <HI>David,</HI> and the Marriage of <HI>Solomon</HI> is &s;poken of in &s;uch lofty and magnificent Terms, tis vi&s;ible, the Writer intended to &s;peak of &s;ome|thing more &s;ublime; i. e. of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and his Union with the Church, to which what he &s;ays of the Kingdom of <HI>David,</HI> and the

<P>And of this Kind is the Prophecy of my Text and Context, which tho' <HI>primarily</HI> relating to <HI>He|zekiah,</HI> and the Jewi&s;h Church and State, yet <HI>&s;e|condarily</HI> relates to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, of whom that King was a Type; and tho' it might have, and hitherto has had a Fulfilment by &s;everal Steps and Degrees, &s;ince the Times of the Go&s;pel commen|ced, (as I &s;hall &s;hew under the third general Head, when I &s;hall con&s;ider this Prophecy <HI>by Way of Accommodation</HI>) yet as I ob&s;erved in my Intro|duction, this Prediction has never yet been ful|filled &s;ince the Coming of Chri&s;t in its ultimate and mo&s;t &s;ublime Sen&s;e, nor &s;hall be, till the Mil|lennial Period arrives.

<P>And now let us &s;ee, how the Pagan Doctrine of <HI>Baalim</HI> and the Wor&s;hip thereof is imitated by the Romi&s;h Church.</P>
<P>The great Apo&s;tacy of the Chri&s;tian Church began in departing from the Faith, and giving heed to &s;educing Spirits and Doctrines of Devils, (Gr. <GAP DESC="foreign">) or Daemons, which is foretold by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Tim. 4. 1.</P>

The Heathens generally wor&s;hipped one &s;u|preme God, but with him they &s;et up other in|ferior Gods, <HI>created Deities,</HI> whom they &s;tiled <HI>Dae|mons</HI> or <HI>Heroes;</HI> the&s;e were &s;ubordinate Divini|ties, Mediators &amp; Interce&s;&s;ors with the &s;upreme God.

<P>So it is in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and this was the <HI>great Apo&s;tacy</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Church, when from being the Spou&s;e of Chri&s;t, &s;he was turned into a Harlot, being guilty of &s;piritual Adultery, even as I&s;rael &amp; Judah.

Tho' he made a &s;olemn Injunction that all the public Sacrifices of what Sort &s;oever they were, whether made by him&s;elf, or by the People, &s;hould be con&s;tantly offered upon his Altar, which he calls the great Altar, (becau&s;e it was much bigger than the Altar of God) <HI>ver.</HI> 15. yet, he would
<PB N="26" REF="008135_0029_102E364EAA36AFB8">
not have it thought, that he intended wholly to lay a&s;ide the Altar made by <HI>Solomon,</HI> but rather to do it great Honour, by re&s;erving it for his private U&s;e, when he plea&s;ed to enquire of God, or at lea&s;t he pretended &s;ome Regard to it, tho' he had de|graded it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bp <HI>Patrick'</HI>s Comment.</NOTE></P>
<P>And this is the Language and Practice of <HI>An|tichri&s;t;</HI> for the <HI>Pope of Rome</HI> cau&s;es <HI>Shrines and Altars</HI> to be made and &s;et up for the <HI>Virgin Mary and the Saints,</HI> the Chri&s;tian, or rather Antichri&s;tian <HI>Baalim,</HI> and orders &s;olemn and divine Adoration and Wor&s;hip to be given unto them; and at the &s;ame Time pretends to have a religious Venera|tion for God and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; though hereby Chri&s;t is excluded his Office, as the one only Mediator between God and Man.&mdash;So the true Chri&s;tian Altar is removed, and the refined <HI>Altar of Baalim,</HI> with a <HI>Chri&s;tian Name</HI> is put in its Place. And as <HI>Ahaz</HI> in Conformity to the <HI>Pa|gans,</HI> wor&s;hipped the Syrian Gods in &amp; by <HI>Images</HI> and <HI>Statues</HI> or Idols, accounting <HI>them</HI> as Repre&s;en|tations and Symbols of the Gods to whom divine Wor&s;hip was paid, (for neither He nor the wi&s;er Heathens tho't the&s;e Images to be Gods, yet the wor&s;hipping them, and the Gods in and by them is true <HI>Idolatry</HI>)&mdash;So the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> who make and &s;et up <HI>Images</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>the Virgin Mary</HI> and <HI>the Saints,</HI> and do not take the&s;e Images to be Gods, but only Repre&s;entations of them, and erected to their Honour, are neverthele&s;s ju&s;tly charged with Idolatry, becau&s;e they fall down be|fore them, and pay religious Wor&s;hip unto them.

This was the Beginning o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Fifth <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> brought on the <HI>whole Reformation,</HI> or the critical Time for the Prote&s;tant Religion and Liberties. It was but the Beginning, for <HI>Europe</HI> was in the Agitations of this Cri&s;is forty Years; i. e. till the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI>&mdash;And here I will take Occa|&s;ion to give &s;ome brief Account of the other four.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The fir&s;t Cri&s;is</HI> was&mdash;when <HI>Charles</HI> 5th. Em|peror of <HI>Germany,</HI> by defeating <HI>John</HI> Duke of Saxony, and the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, and getting them into his Hands, had &s;ubdued the <HI>Smalcaldick League,</HI> in which the Strength of the Prote&s;tants did then con&s;i&s;t: upon that Defeat all &s;ubmitted to the Emperor.</P>
<P><HI>Maurice</HI> now made Elector of Saxony, at the Head of the Imperial Army, at la&s;t re&s;olved not to &s;ee the Ruin of Religion, &amp; Liberty, fell &s;o &s;ud|denly and unexpectedly with his Forces upon the Emperor, that he was very near having &s;urprized and taken him at <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> and &s;o overturned all that De&s;ign, upon which the Emperor had been labouring for many Years, <HI>viz.</HI> de&s;troying the Prote&s;tant Religion and Liberties&mdash;This brought on the Treaty of <HI>Pa&s;&s;au,</HI> and a Peace thereupon between the Emperor, and the Prote&s;tant Princes and States, whereby the free Exerci&s;e of Religion was &s;ecured to the Prote&s;tants; and &s;o that Cri&s;is pa&s;&s;ed over.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>"The &s;econd Cri&s;is</HI> was towards the End of the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> when the Prote&s;tant Religion &s;eemed almo&s;t extingui&s;hed in <HI>England,</HI> and the Cardinal of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> chief Mini&s;ter of <HI>France,</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Granvel</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> de&s;igned a Peace between the two Crowns, that their Ma&s;ters

<HI>Henry</HI> the 2d, and <HI>Philip</HI> 2d. might be at Lei&s;ure to extirpate Here&s;y, as they call it, i. e. the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, which was then &s;preading in both their Dominions. But after they had form|ed their Scheme, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> died, and was &s;uc|ceeded by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and &s;oon after that the French King was accidentally kil|led, and that Kingdom fell under a long Conti|nuance of a Minority, viz. <HI>Charles</HI> the 9th, and a civil War on Account of Religion; and the Ne|therlands felt from thence and from Queen <HI>Eliz|abeth,</HI> &s;uch Encouragement that they made the longe&s;t and brave&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Power of <HI>Philip,</HI> that is to be found in all Hi&s;tory; and the Cri&s;is ended."</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Third Cri&s;is</HI> of the Reformation began in 1585, and la&s;ted three Years.&mdash;The Catholic League (&s;o called) of the Papi&s;ts in <HI>France,</HI> was fomidable for a Time to the Prote&s;tants; the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> was victorious in the Nether|lands; the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was murdered, and the States fell under great Di&s;tractions, &amp; <HI>Spain</HI> entred into a De&s;ign of invading <HI>England,</HI> &amp; dethroning Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and putting the Queen of Scots in her Stead: In order to that, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was for &s;ome Years preparing the greate&s;t Fleet that the World had ever &s;een, which came to be cal|led the <HI>Invincible Armada;</HI> and with the Di&s;ap|pointment &amp; Ruin of that Fleet, this Cri&s;is went off.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Fourth Cri&s;is</HI> came on in the Reign of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> 2d Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> and King of <HI>Bohemia</HI>&mdash;His Government was &s;evere in that Kingdom, and he re&s;olved to extirpate the Pro|te&s;tants, and began to break through the Privi|leges

that were &s;ecured to them by the Laws of the Kingdom: This occa&s;ioned a general In&s;ur|rection, which was followed by an A&s;&s;embly of the States, who depo&s;ed him, and offered the Crown to <HI>Frederick</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th Elector Palatine, who accepted it, depending on the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Father-in-Law <HI>James</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">He married <HI>Elizabeth</HI> only Daughter of King <HI>James.</HI></NOTE> which if he had afford|ed, here was the mo&s;t probable Occa&s;ion that had been, or has yet been offered &s;ince the Reforma|tion for the full E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Prote&s;tant Religion in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Nation was much inclined to &s;upport <HI>Frederick,</HI> but he had an invincible Aver|&s;ion to War, and was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in Belief of a Divine Right in all Kings, that he could not bear that even an elective and limited King &s;hould be called in Que&s;tion by his Subjects, &s;o he would never acknowlege his Son-in-Law, nor give him any A&s;&s;i&s;tance for the Support of his new Dig|nity; and <HI>Holland</HI> was very backward in giving A&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Frederic</HI> being beaten by the Empe|ror's Army near <HI>Prague,</HI> was drove out of his new Kingdom; the Palatinates, his Patrimony or Hereditary Dominions, were taken from him, and &s;o he and his Wife and Children fled to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> for a Place of Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the Imperial Army (which was &s;ent into all Parts of <HI>Germany</HI> to di&s;tre&s;s it) the Circle of Lower Saxony did arm it &s;elf, under the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> their General, but he received a great Overthrow by <HI>Tilly</HI> the Emperor's General, and thereupon the whole Power of the Prote&s;tants was broken.&mdash;The Emperor was &s;o elevated with

<P>And the <HI>Fifth Cri&s;is</HI> which I touched before, began in 1672, when <HI>Louis</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> confede|rated to &s;wallow up the united Provinces, to ma&s;ter <HI>England,</HI> to demoli&s;h Prote&s;tanti&s;m both in <HI>England</HI> &amp; <HI>Holland,</HI> to pave the Way for the Extirpation of that Religion through all <HI>Europe,</HI> and for e&s;tabli&s;hing Popery.</P>
<P><HI>This Cri&s;is,</HI> as I &s;aid, continued in Agitation forty Years&mdash;The glorious <HI>Prince of Orange</HI> broke <HI>Louis'</HI>s-Mea&s;ures, and overturned his Schemes for that Time; yet not many Years after, the <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> ro&s;e again, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1685; when <HI>Louis</HI> recalled, and vacated the Edict of Toleration of the Pro|te&s;tants, as he had been for many Years before weakning the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in <HI>France,</HI> to prepare for this fatal Stroke.</P>
<P>"The Year <HI>Eighty-five,</HI> mu&s;t ever be remem|bred as the mo&s;t fatal to the Prote&s;tant Religion. In <HI>February</HI> King <HI>James</HI> II. of <HI>England</HI> declared him|&s;elf a Papi&s;t, and went openly to Ma&s;s.

<P>"Men and Women who would not yield, were not only &s;trip'd of all they had, but kept long from Sleep, and driven about from Place to Place.

<P>But <HI>the Cri&s;is</HI> ro&s;e again in the Beginning of this Century.</P>

<P>And a little after in the &s;ame Year <HI>Charles</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain</HI> died (without I&s;&s;ue) and by his Will (real or forged) the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> &s;econd Son of the Dauphin was made his Succe&s;&s;or to the whole Spani&s;h Monarchy, contrary to the Treaty of Partition: And upon his declaring that he accepted of the Will, he was proclaimed, &s;a|luted and treated as King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and thereupon he went to <HI>Spain,</HI> and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new Kingdom.</P>
<P>And immediately French Troops were &s;ent to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Spani&s;h Netherlands. This unexpected Event threw a dark Cloud over the Face of Affairs in <HI>Europe.

For wherever tho&s;e People &s;ettled, they e&s;tabli&s;hed a Government of Liberty, and &s;hewed them&s;elves to be greater Ma&s;ters of the great Secret of <HI>governing ALL by ALL,</HI> than tho&s;e Nations that had given them the opprobrious Name of <HI>Barbarous;</HI> and as they were all Joint-Adventurers in their military Expeditions, &s;o all had a Share in their ci|vil Government, and the Lands they conquered. For they cho&s;e their General and great Officers, to conduct them in the War (which great Officers were a Council of War to the Generals in le&s;&s;er Matters, but in Affairs of greater Im|portance, they a&s;&s;embled the whole Army, and con&s;ulted with all the Soldiers or People under their Command. When they came to be &s;ettled in Peace, the Lands of the conquered Country were divided; the General had his Share, the Officers their's, and the Soldiers or People their's. The General became their Prince, and when he died, ano|ther was cho&s;en to &s;ucceed him by a general Election. The great Officers were now his <HI>Council of State</HI> in le&s;&s;er Matters, as they had been before, <HI>his Council of War;</HI> but in great Affairs, and Matters of Weight relating to the Publick, all the People were a&s;&s;embled, and advi&s;ed with in the Manner they had been during their military Expedition.

<P>Wherever the&s;e northern Nations &s;ettled, they e&s;tabli&s;hed a Government, framed out of Monarchy, Ari&s;tocracy, and Democracy. <HI>France, Spain, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Britain,</HI> had all this Sort of Government, which is no other than a li|mited Monarchy, tho' <HI>Britain</HI> is the only Nation in the World that &s;till retains it. The Founder of this incompa|rable Sort of Government very well knew, that Monarchy, when corrupted, degenerates into Tyranny; that Ari&s;to|cracy, (i.e. The Government of the Nobles) being cor|rupted, turns into an Oligarchy; (i.e. Government by a few, or a &s;mall Number) and that Democracy (i.e. the Go|vernment of the People) was liable to Tumults and Confu|&s;ions: and therefore to avoid the Danger, that might ari&s;e from either of them &s;eparately, compo&s;ed the mo&s;t exact Scheme of Government out of them all, and which in our Language is called King, Lords and Commons. Each of the&s;e have their proper Spheres to move in, and whil&s;t they continue within them, the Government is ea&s;y, and the Con|&s;titution &s;afe; but if the Motion of any one of them inter|feres with that of the other, the whole Frame is out of Or|der, and the Con&s;titution immediately falls into Convul&s;ions, and without wi&s;e and &s;peedy Applications, mu&s;t expire in an Apoplexy.&mdash;In the happy I&s;land of <HI>Britain,</HI> which well de&s;erves the glorious Name of the <HI>Capital of Liberty,</HI> the Property of the meane&s;t Subject is &s;o &s;trongly guarded by Law, that a moderate Fortune here is infinitely more va|luable than the highe&s;t Honours, and greate&s;t Riches, a Subject is capable of attaining in any Country of the World, where the Will of the Prince, (and not the Safety of the People) is the &s;upreme Law.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;But though in <HI>Great Britain</HI> only, the ancient, generous and manly Government of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;urvives and continues in its original Lu&s;tre &amp; Perfection, and is a mo&s;t exact Scheme of Politicks; yet it may be endangered by any one of the Branches of the Con&s;titution invading the Province of the other. And if hereafter this Nation &s;hould &s;o far lo&s;e its Virtue, as to have its Lords and Commons become ba&s;ely &s;ervile and mercenary, there will not be wanting evil Mini|&s;ters, who will advi&s;e the Prince to lay hold of the Oppor|tunity to purcha&s;e from them their Liberty, and bribe them into Slavery."</P></NOTE></P>

Let us mo&s;t gratefully ob&s;erve the wonder|ful Appearances of a gracious God for the&s;e Na|tions, in pre&s;erving to them this excelling Con|&s;titution of civil Government, and &s;aying them from Tyranny, Slavery and antichri&s;tian Dark|ne&s;s. Many a Time has the Lord delivered his People when in Danger of &s;udden De&s;truction, and has cau&s;ed Light to &s;hine out of Ob&s;curity. It will &s;uffice, if I go no further back than the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, who &s;et up his Will and Prerogative above the Laws of the Land, and endeavoured to overturn the whole Con&s;ti|tution; and upon the Di&s;&s;olution of the old e&s;tab|li&s;hed Government, to introduce an ab&s;olute de&s;|potick
<PB N="82" REF="008135_0085_102E36DBB1921810">
Power, in Imitation and according to the Pattern of <HI>Louis</HI> 14th of <HI>France,</HI> and therewith to bring in the popi&s;h Religion, &s;o well calculated for an Agreement with arbitrary Power in the State, under a Prince wholly Je&s;uited, and under the Influence of Bigotry to the Romi&s;h Principles almo&s;t without a Parallel.</P>
<P>But lo! in the mid&s;t of Di&s;tre&s;s and Perplexity of the Briti&s;h People, God rai&s;ed up a Deliverer, the <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> afterwards the glorious King WILLIAM, the great Re&s;torer of the Eng|li&s;h Con&s;titution, and under God their Saviour from Slavery and Popery.</P>
<P>God &s;uddenly broke the Schemes, di&s;appoint|ed and bla&s;ted the De&s;igns and Stratagems of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> for our Ruin. And on the Prince's Arrival, the golden Phantoms of un|bounded Rule and Sovereignty that had &s;o long glittered in the King's Eyes, di&s;appeared in a Moment, and he found him&s;elf &s;tanding on a frightful Precipice, and the Support that bore him broke under him. The happy Revolution ought never to be forgotten by Prote&s;tants, Britons, and Tran&s;marine Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The Nations were delivered from an arbitrary popi&s;h King and je&s;uitical Coun&s;els; and from the Hazard of having a &s;uppo&s;ititious Heir of the Crown impo&s;ed on them, and educated in the Romi&s;h Communion, to the Ruin of their Reli|gion and Property.</P>
<P>And in the Reign of this our great Deliverer and Re&s;torer, the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h Crown was &s;ettled in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> the parlia|mentary E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Succe&s;&s;ion in that
<PB N="83" REF="008135_0086_102E36DE2A1AA7F0">
illu&s;trious Family, to the Exclu&s;ion of all Papi&s;ts, tho' nearer in Blood, was the Con&s;equence of the happy Revolution.</P>
<P>And this indeed is an undoubted and indi&s;pu|table Title, being done by the whole Legi&s;lature of a wi&s;e and free prote&s;tant People, jealous of their civil Liberties, and highly regarding the Protection of their religious Rights, as prote&s;tant Britons.&mdash;And from the Time forward the an|cient good and whole&s;ome Laws and Statutes were re&s;tored for the publick Weal. And the Nation being recovered to a State of Freedom, did by their Parliaments make u&s;e of their Liber|ty, to make &s;uch other Laws, and take &s;uch other Methods as were mo&s;t proper to pre&s;erve them from &s;uch Dangers in Times to come. "And moreover the Nations were delivered from a Rem|nant of Popery, that &s;tuck &s;o long to them, <HI>viz.</HI> Per&s;ecution of prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>by the Act of Toleration,</HI> which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and God grant it ever may continue in full Force, according to the true Intent &amp; Meaning thereof, whereby all Pro|te&s;tants are at Liberty to wor&s;hip God, according as they are per&s;waded in their Con&s;cience is mo&s;t agreable to his Will, without fear of being ruin'd in their Per&s;ons or E&s;tates by any Faction promp|ted thereunto by the Court, and without Hazard of having any Party of Prote&s;tants join with Pa|pi&s;ts to overthrow the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church for pri|vate Intere&s;t." Nor &s;hould we overlook the for|mer and late Deliverances granted by our God from the popi&s;h Pretenders both Father and Son. This, this is an un&s;peakable Mercy&mdash;For woe, woe to the Briti&s;h Nations and Plantations, if
<PB N="84" REF="008135_0087_102E36E1A3BC3950">
ever the <HI>Pretender,</HI> or <HI>any of his Race</HI> gets Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Briti&s;h Throne. But we tru&s;t in God who hath delivered, that He will yet deliver us, that <HI>the King, the Prince, the whole Royal Hou&s;e,</HI> with the Nation, may joy in the Strength of the Lord, and greatly rejoyce in his Salvation.</P>
<P>I go on,</P>
<P>III. In Application of our Text to this Pro|vince, and the civil Government thereof, as a Branch of the Briti&s;h State and Empire.&mdash;Let us with deep Attention con&s;ider its peculiar Privi|leges by the Royal CHARTER, and the Smiles of our gracious Sovereigns, and let us acknowlege the divine Goodne&s;s in pre&s;erving to us our ex|cellent Con&s;titution.&mdash;</P>
<P>This People have been favoured in former Times with <HI>excellent Governours,</HI> or <HI>chief Com|manders,</HI> by the tender Care of our nur&s;ing Fathers and nur&s;ing Mothers&mdash;among whom a <HI>Dudley,</HI> a <HI>Belcher,</HI> and a <HI>Dummer,</HI> cannot be forgotten; Gentlemen of Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s, in the Admini&s;tration of Government&mdash;of Religion and Virtue, and memorable for their great Re|gard and Affection to the Mini&s;ters of Religion.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dummer</HI> will be remember'd in the Land, for his mo&s;t prudent, righteous and mild Conduct of the public Affairs, &s;o happy for the Province, and &s;o plea&s;ing to the People.&mdash;He retired from the Government to a private Life, with a Temper and Behaviour &s;o &s;uitable to a Soul that is rai&s;ed above the World, and the Honours of it, to a de|vout Contemplation on heavenly Glories.&mdash;In his advanced Age, he has the Comfort in Reflection of having &s;erved his GOD, his King &amp; his Country, with Integrity.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="008135_0088_102E36E41E0C42C0">
We cannot be unmindful of the Smiles from the Throne in the Appointment of &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd and accompli&s;h'd Gentlemen as Mr. <HI>Addington,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> to the very important Place of Secretary.&mdash;Mr. Secretary <HI>Addington</HI> was famous in his Day for Wi&s;dom, Probity and Fidelity in the di&s;charge of the public Tru&s;t.&mdash;And the Name of Mr. Secretary <HI>Willard (the good Secretary)</HI> is as the mo&s;t fragrant Ointment. The Fame of his good Deeds, his long and &s;aithful public Services, remains after he is dead, and he will live in a good Report.&mdash;His Continuance in the Secretary's Of|fice forty Years, and in all that Time managing the Affairs under his Care, not only without Error and Fault, but with univer&s;al Applau&s;e, is with|out a Precedent, and cannot but rai&s;e our Admi|ration.</P>
<P>He was a Chri&s;tian of a true primitive Spirit, <HI>an I&s;raelite indeed, without Guile,</HI> and a &s;hining Ex|ample of Piety and Virtue. This excellent Ser|vant of God is decea&s;ed&mdash;and is it not our Duty to embalm his precious Memory?

<P>But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion, for which I a&s;k Pardon, if I have offended.</P>
<P>As we have in Times preceeding been happy under wi&s;e and good Governours, &s;o we hope to be thus happy in Times coming.&mdash;</P>
<P>Our good and gracious KING has given us a fre&s;h Mark of his Royal Favour, in appointing Mr. POWNALL to the chief Seat of Government, at &s;uch a Day as this.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Your Excellency</HI> in your great Goodne&s;s, will permit me on this public Occa&s;ion &amp; Solemnity, to congratulate <HI>you</HI> as the <HI>chief Prince</HI> among the Princes of the Province, tru&s;ting in God, that you will <HI>rule in Judgment</HI> under King GEORGE, <HI>who reigns in Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>&mdash;that under GOD <HI>and the</HI> KING, you will be <HI>as a hiding Place, and a Refuge from the Storm,</HI> in the pre&s;ent <HI>tumultuous and tem|pe&s;tuous State&mdash;as Rivers of Waters in a dry Place, as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</HI></P>
<P>We render our hearty Thanks to God the &s;u|preme Governor among the Nations, that he has directed the KING to a Gentleman of &s;o great Ca|pacity for Government.&mdash;Though with the aged, by long Experience, there is Wi&s;dom; yet God giveth to the young Man al&s;o, Knowlege &amp; Di&s;cre|tion.&mdash;<HI>Elihu,</HI> though inferior in Years to <HI>Job and his three Friends,</HI> yet appeared much &s;uperior to them all in Under&s;tanding, in a right Knowlege of God, his Attributes, Providence and Govern|ment of the World:&mdash;And we hope the Under|&s;tanding

<P>All civiliz'd Nations and Countries have ex|pre&s;&s;ed their Sen&s;e of this; that Governors and Men in Authority ought to be Men of good Ca|pacity and Knowlege.&mdash;When our Saxon An|ce&s;tors gave the Name of <HI>Koning</HI> (by Contraction <HI>King</HI>) that is, <HI>a wi&s;e Man,</HI> to their <HI>&s;upreme Magi|&s;trate,</HI> they taught us, what was a nece&s;&s;ary Pro|perty in crowned Heads, which is al&s;o a nece&s;&s;a|ry Qualification in Governors &amp; Magi&s;trates un|der them.&mdash;The Emperor <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> (An|toninus Philo&s;ophus) had very often in his Mouth that Saying of the great Philo&s;opher <HI>Plato,</HI> that <HI>then indeed Common-wealths would flouri&s;h, when Phi|lo&s;ophers reigned, when Rulers were &s;killed in Phi|lo&s;ophy.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jul.

<P>The Character of a true Philo&s;opher takes in religious Endowments, &amp; moral Virtues, in which we &s;hall behold you no common Example&mdash;And
