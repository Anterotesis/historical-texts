<BIBL>PSALM II. 10, 12.</BIBL>
<Q>Be wi&s;e now therefore, O ye Kings: be in&s;tructed, ye Judges of the Earth. Ki&s;s the Son&mdash;.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_TIS ea&s;ie and u&s;eful to ob&s;erve how the Word of God frequently re|pre&s;ents the Ruler of his People in a <HI>twofold</HI> Light: In the <HI>One,</HI> we behold him rai&s;ed up by di|vine Appointment &amp; Providence to Rule and Judge the People; In the <HI>other,</HI> we view him on a Level with every Subject to be ruled and judged by the &s;ame Laws and Lord. With relation to the former of the&s;e Capacities, we have had frequent Di&s;cour&s;es upon the&s;e Occa|&s;ions, have &s;een the civil Ruler fixed in his Po&s;t, cloathed with Authority from the great Gover|nour of the World, made the Mini&s;ter of his Providence, <HI>A Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil,</HI> Rom. 1. 3. 4. and a Protector to defend him that doth well. And have heard the People <HI>put in mind to be &s;ubject to Principa|lities and Powers, to obey Magi&s;trates,</HI> Tit. 3. 1. not only for <HI>wrath,</HI> but al&s;o for <HI>Con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="006131_0005_1027F0B1EC14F920">
It mayn't then be un&s;ea&s;onable to treat of civil Rulers in their &s;ubjected Capacity, <HI>as under the Law to Christ,</HI> and in Conformity to the in|&s;pired Preacher in our Text, declare their Ob|ligations to Zion's King, who demands their Submi&s;&s;ion and Obedience.</P>
<P>In this P&s;alm the Spirit of Prophe&s;y te&s;tifies and declares the mighty oppo&s;ition that would be made to the Redeemer's Kingdom, the Victories and triumphs of his Grace, and the extent of his Empire notwith&s;tanding, that he &s;hould have <HI>the Heathen for an Inheritance, and the uttermost parts of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Earth for a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, ver.</HI> 8. And that his Oppo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s who wou'd not &s;ubmit to his Sceptre &s;hould <HI>be broken with a rod of Iron, and da&s;ht in pieces like a Potter's Ve&s;&s;el, ver.</HI> 9. His invincible power &s;hould ruin them &s;uddenly, ea&s;ily and irrecoverably. To all which is &s;ubjoined the moving &amp; pertinent addre&s;s in our Text, <HI>Be wi&s;e now therefore, O ye Kings: be in&s;tructed, ye Judges of the Earth.

This advice belongs to all both high &amp; low, rich &amp; poor together, for all are equally concern'd to become obedient <HI>to the Lord from Heaven.</HI> Only 'tis directed to
<PB N="3" REF="006131_0006_1027F0B375499DE8">
Kings and Judges, the Heads &amp; Leaders of a People, who&s;e Examples have ordinarily a prevailing Influence upon tho&s;e under them. Their <HI>Obedience to the Faith</HI> opens a great Door and effectual unto the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and their <HI>Di&s;obedience</HI> &s;huts up the Kingdom of Heaven again&s;t Men. Thus mightily prevail'd that argument, Joh. 7, 48. <HI>Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phari&s;ees believed on him?</HI></P>
<P>The intervening ver&s;e contains the <HI>general</HI> Matter of Duty enjoined on them, together with the Direction how to qualify it. <HI>Serve the Lord with Fear, rejoice with trembling,</HI> v. 11. <HI>Serve the Lord,</HI> for he is your Maker and Pre|&s;erver, Friend and Benefactor, Redeemer and Judge. <HI>With Fear, with awful Fear</HI> &amp; &s;olemn Caution, for the Lord is a holy &amp; jealous God, who cannot be deceived &amp; will not be mocked, <HI>who accepteth not the Per&s;on of Princes, nor re|gardeth the Rich more than the poor,</HI> Job 34. 19. <HI>Who will cut off the &s;pirit of Princes, and is ter|rible to the Kings of the Earth,</HI> if they rebel a|gain&s;t him, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 76. 12. <HI>With filial Fear</HI> and Reverence, for he is a God of tender mercies and great Kindne&s;s, and delights in them who are free &amp; chearful in his Service. And th&ocirc; you <HI>rejoice</HI> in all that the Lord has done to and for you, in that he has honoured you before his People, and &s;et you among Princes &amp; great Men on the Earth, and has br&ocirc;t you under the

Di&s;pen&s;ation of his Grace; Yet con&s;ider that ab&s;olute rejoicing is the Condition and Em|ploy of Angels, and not of Men, who are to qualify this grateful Exerci&s;e <HI>with trembling,</HI> le&s;t they receive the Grace &amp; Goodne&s;s of God in vain, le&s;t being lifted up to heaven, exalted high in Honours and Privileges, they are br&ocirc;t down to Hell. Rai&s;ed Circum&s;tances prove a Snare to many, Joh. 5. 44. <HI>How can ye believe who receive Honour One of another, and &s;eek not the Honour that cometh from God only?</HI> And the great do fall when the Lord ari&s;es to di&s;|pen&s;e Judgment. P&s;al. 110. 5, 6. <HI>He &s;hall &s;trike thr&ocirc; Kings in the Day of his Wrath, and &s;hall wound the Heads over many Countries.</HI> There|fore <HI>rejoice with trembling.</HI> Thus their Duty in <HI>General</HI> is &s;et forth and qualified.</P>
<P>The more <HI>particular</HI> Command to them be|gins the 12th ver. <HI>Ki&s;s the Son,</HI>&mdash;This figu|rative Expre&s;&s;ion may be under&s;tood, and ap|plied by us agreeable to its literal Significancy and u&s;e, in <HI>three</HI> re&s;pects.</P>

<HI>For he is the Author of eternal Salvation unto all them that Obey him,</HI> Heb. 5. 9. And as this is a matter of the highe&s;t Importance and of uni|ver&s;al Concern, &s;o 'tis my Duty <HI>to &s;peak as the Oracles of God,</HI> 1 Pet. 4. 11.

<P><PB N="7" REF="006131_0010_1027F0C02D328E80">
The once humbled &amp; &s;uffering &s;tate of the Redeemer was for a Stone of &s;tumbling and Rock of offence to the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael: They wou'd not have <HI>this Man,</HI> &s;o mean of Paren|tage, &s;o low in outward circum&s;tances, <HI>to rule over them:</HI> Yet to prevent offence we hear the Holy Gho&s;t when foretelling his Incarnation, at the &s;ame time giving him tho&s;e Titles which be&s;peak him very God, <HI>our rightful Sovereign.</HI> I&s;a. 9. 6, 7. <HI>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government &s;hall be upon his Shoulder: And his Name &s;hall be called, Won|derful, Coun&s;eller, the mighty God, the everla&s;t|ing Father, the Prince of Peace.

It robs our Religion of One of its chief &amp; peculiar Glories, and rejects the Head-corner Stone in the Chri|&s;tian Building. Thus the fooli&s;h Builders in the jewi&s;h Church did, to their own Overthrow and Di&s;per&s;ion.

Why then wou'd any, thro' the pride and naughtine&s;s of their Hearts, revive that dangerous Creed which was the Root of the Jews Infidelity &amp; Ruin; and in Vindication of which they cou'd not an&s;wer a word, when Chri&s;t put that plain convincing Que&s;tion to them, Mat. 22. 43, 44, 45. <HI>He &s;aith unto them, How then did David in &s;pirit call him Lord, &s;aying, the Lord &s;aid unto my Lord, &s;it thou on my right hand, 'till I make thine Enemies thy foot&s;tool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his Son?</HI> They did not, or they wou'd not know the Me&s;&s;iah to be <HI>Lord,</HI> "which Truth was the only Key to unlock this Difficulty." But ble&s;&s;ed be God, who hath hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent and revealed them unto Babes, hath divinely taught &s;o many of the Sons and Daughters of men this My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, <HI>God manifest in the Fle&s;h.

he a&s;&s;embles together the Princes of the Tribes and Captains, and in their Pre&s;ence and for their Benefit, he gives this <HI>Charge</HI> to <HI>Solomon</HI> who was to &s;it on the Throne after him; A <HI>Charge</HI> that peculiarly re&s;pected him as he was to be Ruler and Head of I&s;rael, 1 Chron. 28. 9. <HI>And thou, Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart and a willing Mind.</HI> Other Qualifications there are which beautifie &amp; adorn a Prince, but <HI>this</HI> of a <HI>heart devoted</HI> to God is <HI>chief</HI> of all; and will appear &s;o under the apprehen&s;ion of Death and Judgment, when our Th&ocirc;ts are fixt, and mo&s;t likely to weigh things in an equal Balance.</P>
<P>This Qualification is mo&s;t plea&s;ing to God and beneficial to Men; and therefore challen|ges the fir&s;t &amp; chief Attention of our Rulers, whether of a <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> or <HI>Executive</HI> Capacity.

<P>Devotedne&s;s to God is directly oppo&s;ite to that &s;elfi&s;h Principle which reigns in the world, which &s;ends thou&s;ands to Hell, which is the grand Incendiary of Di&s;cord &amp; Convul&s;ions in Church &amp; State, which has overturn'd Kingdoms on Earth, and rooted out the Rulers of them.</P>

Hence that in Prov. 28. 15, <HI>As a roaring Lion, and a ranging Bear, &s;o is a wicked Ruler over the poor People.</HI> He is a Terror to them. But when <HI>Power is joined with Goodne&s;s,</HI> it begets E&s;teem &amp; Confidence.

<P N="4">4.

Is it thus with us?&mdash;Do we as his Subjects war again&s;t Sin, renounce the World, the Fle&s;h &amp; Devil? Do we hate Sin, and not regard Iniquity in our hearts?

Are we like to Chri&s;t, have we put on the Lord Je&s;us in heart and Life?

Do we heartily tru&s;t in him to &s;trengthen us, and carry us on in our chri&s;tian Cour&s;e, that we may &s;o run as to obtain?&mdash;He that lacketh the&s;e things is not purged from his old Sins.

<P>Some may tell us that the Law is open, and that we may help our&s;elves that way.

<P>It is but ju&s;t &amp; equal, that this Law &s;hould Operate with Reference to Lands &s;eque&s;tred to pious U&s;es in this Age, &s;o far as Circum&s;tances agree The Rea&s;on of Redemption (which was that every Tribe might po&s;&s;e&s;s the Inheritance of their Fathers) now cea&s;es.

<P N="2">2. In the <HI>Second</HI> place, I turn my Addre&s;s to our <HI>Lawyers,</HI> Solicitors of Cau&s;es.

Temptations which attend your calling, in&s;pire you with Zeal to Vindicate Truth &amp; Innocency, and Oppo&s;e every Cau&s;e which the Lord di&s;|owns. <HI>This</HI> wou'd make you boldly frown upon tho&s;e malicious, trouble&s;ome People, who are vexing their Nei'bours with litigious Law|&s;uits; and expo&s;e them, when need &s;o requires, to publick Shame. <HI>This</HI> wou'd keep you from corrupting Ju&s;tice, by confident A&s;&s;ertions and &s;ophi&s;tical Pleas; <Q>And from u&s;ing the Law, which was made to protect Men in their Rights and Properties, as a means of over|throwing them.</Q> <HI>This</HI> wou'd direct you in all Cau&s;es, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Jury, to Inform their Judgments, and not blind their Eyes, that the righteous may depart your Courts with Joy, and the wicked with &s;adne&s;s. <HI>This</HI> wou'd U|nite you to the &s;peedie&s;t I&s;&s;ue of the Ca&s;es you Undertake, that you might not do Inju&s;tice, by Delays of Ju&s;tice, and oppre&s;s your Clients, by creating needle&s;s and extraordinary Charge to them. <HI>This</HI> wou'd teach you that the <HI>Law is good, when a Man u&s;es it lawfully,</HI> and then only; and influence you in all things, to <HI>quit</HI> your&s;elves like <HI>Men,</HI> who wait for the appearance of the Judge of all, and Expect then to receive a righteous and irrevocable Judgment.</P>

<P N="3">3. In the <HI>Third</HI> Place, I turn my Di&s;cour&s;e to the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of Chri&s;t. Reverend Fathers and Brethren, After great Conflicts with my &s;elf, I have undertaken the Service his <HI>Honour</HI> has enjoined me, knowing that I am more fit to

<P N="1">(1) Re&s;pecting <HI>our per&s;onal Duty.</HI> That we <HI>Ki&s;s the Son,</HI> heartily believe in him as our Sa|viour, and &s;ubmit to him as our Lord. <HI>Take heed to your &s;elves,</HI> is the fir&s;t Article in our Charge, <HI>Act.</HI> 20. 28.

<P>As Mini&s;ters in his Kingdom, we are to open the Nature of it, &s;hew it to be a Kingdom of Light, oppo&s;ite to that kingdom of Darkne&s;s in which Satan Rules: for which cau&s;e when Men become real Chri&s;tians, are bro't to believe the Go&s;pel &amp; embrace it, they are &s;aid <HI>to be de|livered from the Power of Darkne&s;s, and tran&s;la|ted into the Kingdom of Je&s;us Christ, Col.</HI> 1. 13.</P>

<P>'Tis for want of divine Light, that there is no more true Life and holy living among the People of God.

<P>Th&ocirc; Men are to be treated as moral Agents, yet many of them are govern'd more by their Appetites &amp; Pa&s;&s;ions than by Rea&s;on and Judg|ment; therefore our Lord and Law-giver has
