<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR CHARGE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Sabbath compleats a HALF CENTURY &s;ince I was ordained a Pa&s;tor, and upon the laying on the hands of the Pre&s;bytery, &s;olemnly ve&s;ted and charged with the care of &s;ouls in this place.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="017182_0004_0FA073764FE4D518">
WHOEVER has ju&s;t views of eternal things mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that in the name of Chri&s;t to mini&s;ter to im|mortals, who are &s;o intere&s;ted in tho&s;e things, is the mo&s;t important employ in the world. Accordingly the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> a mini&s;ter of the Lord, makes fre|quent mention of the matter of his charge, as lying with the greate&s;t weight on his mind. And however imperfect and unprofitable I have been in the di&s;charge of my office, I think I can heartily join him therein. He had his peculiar trials, but they moved him not; for he counted not his life dear unto him&s;elf, in the di&s;|charge of his arduous tru&s;t, if &s;o be he might fini&s;h his cour&s;e with joy. The&s;e la&s;t words ab&s;tractly, contain matter equally concerning to all chri&s;tians; which viewed in its &s;olemn importance, is enough to &s;ilence every amu&s;ement, and command the mo&s;t entire atten|tion of man. But connected with the following clau&s;e, they redouble their energy upon that order of men, here per&s;onated by the venerable Apo&s;tle.&mdash;He receiv|ed commi&s;&s;ion to mini&s;ter in matters relative to pre|cious &s;ouls and things eternal&mdash;things weighty enough to cru&s;h the &s;houlders of Angels, and affect their minds with the deepe&s;t &s;ollicitude; as the honour of GOD, and the &s;alvation of men, were jointly and &s;o greatly con|cerned therein. An affecting &s;en&s;e of this (as the time drew nigh in which he mu&s;t give an account to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t) con&s;trains him, as in my text to &s;ay, <HI>Neither count I my life dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I might
<PB N="7" REF="017182_0005_0FA073770B6845D8">
fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the Go&s;pel of the grace of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>OH how ponderous; how weighty the care of &s;ouls, on the hearts of faithful mini&s;ters! St. <HI>Paul</HI> had &s;uch lively apprehen&s;ions of this, that death, in whatever form it threaten him, moves him not, if the&s;e two things may but happily con&s;pire in his favour, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that his cour&s;e might end with joy, and the Lord Je&s;us ac|count him faithful in the mini&s;try which he had re|ceived of him. The &s;ummary of which is, to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of GOD. To do this, is evan|gelically and faithfully to preach the divine word, not &s;hunning to declare the whole coun&s;el of GOD. Con&s;cious of having &s;o done, the Apo&s;tle is emboldened to make his appeal to the elders of the churches in the words &s;ucceeding the text. As a dying man, who&s;e face he expected they would &s;ee no more, he calls them to record, that he was pure from the blood of all men; not having &s;hunned to declare unto them the whole coun&s;el of GOD. Thus he appeals to their con&s;ciences for witne&s;s, that without re&s;ervation, in its fulne&s;s&mdash;he had &s;et forth the glorious go&s;pel of GOD's free grace, as he had been directed by the re|velation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>HAD he failed of this&mdash;had he legalized the go&s;pel&mdash;had he &s;hifted it off from the proper ba&s;is, well might his confidence de&s;ert him: But he had accom|pli&s;hed his errand;&mdash;had &s;incerely te&s;tified the go&s;pel
<PB N="8" REF="017182_0006_0FA07377CCBA50E8">
of the grace of GOD. Hence we behold the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that &s;ettled pro&s;pect of fini&s;hing his cour&s;e with joy; which indeed is the highe&s;t attain|ment of a Saint this &s;ide Heaven.</P>
<P>IF we take a look at this world, and the cour&s;e of ungodly men, lo! all that is therein is putrid and pa&s;&s;|ing, and what &s;hall their end be! But we behold the cour&s;ers to Zion upon their high places; and how ju&s;t|ly do they e&s;teem all things on earth as dung and dro&s;s, if they may attain to plea&s;e GOD, and be accepted of a glorious Chri&s;t, in the great day of his appearing.</P>
<P>IN further meditation on the &s;acred pa&s;&s;age before us, I would lead the minds of the audience to con&s;ider;</P>
<P>THAT every man here in this life hath his cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT this his cour&s;e will certainly be fini&s;hed, in a &s;hort time, either with joy or &s;orrow.</P>
<P>THAT it is of infinite importance to all, &s;o to con|duct in life, as that they may fini&s;h their cour&s;e with joy.</P>
<P>AND e&s;pecially mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, who&s;e great and main bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of GOD.</P>
<P>THAT every man here in this life hath his cour&s;e, will not be doubted; but briefly to attend to it.</P>
<P>THE word <HI>cour&s;e</HI> intimates that &s;eries of actions which pertains to any per&s;on. Every Agent then has his cour&s;e. A man's calling is his cour&s;e; whether &s;e|cular, civil or &s;acred; and he that hath no good calling, or employment, nece&s;&s;arily has a bad one. That
<PB N="9" REF="017182_0007_0FA073788DD5E690">
which a man mainly bu&s;ieth him&s;elf about, is eminent|ly his cour&s;e. He that is engaged for Heaven, em|ploys his thoughts&mdash;fixes his mind, and bends his &s;tu|dies to know how he may plea&s;e GOD, and an&s;wer the great intent of his being.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xxx. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Who is this that engageth his heart to approach unto me? &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the grand object of every good man's care and &s;tudy.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I Cor. ix. 24.</NOTE> <HI>So run that ye may obtain, i. e.</HI> u&s;e dili|gence, care and con&s;tancy in the chri&s;tian cour&s;e, that you may obtain the prize of glory.</P>
<P>HE that is engaged for the world bends his cour&s;e that way&mdash;mediates, conver&s;es and labours to obtain the enjoyments of it&mdash;makes that his ultimate end. Directly oppo&s;ed to this, is that caution of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John. vi. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Labour not for the meat which peri&s;heth, but for that meat which endureth unto everla&s;ting life, which the Son of Man &s;hall give unto you.</HI></P>
<P>MAN is a bu&s;y creature, formed for action: And as there is here no continuing city, &s;o his life is call|ed a race, and the manner in which he practi&s;eth his cour&s;e, whether it be good or evil. Which of the&s;e is ours, is determined by the temper of our hearts. Thus are we taught by our Lord,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 35.</NOTE> <HI>A good man out of the good trea&s;ure of the heart bringeth forth good things; and an evil man out of the evil trea&s;ure bringeth forth evil things.</HI></P>
<P>THE great author of the world at fir&s;t placed man in
<PB N="10" REF="017182_0008_0FA073794C59D5B0">
a very happy &s;ituation&mdash;with his face toward Hea|ven, and his heart ingeniou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to holine&s;s in life and all manner of conver&s;ation: But his high hand|ed rebellion has turned his face from GOD, and plunged him into a labyrinth of wretchedne&s;s. Hence that divine order from the Lord of all,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 33.</NOTE> <HI>Make the tree good.</HI> This neglected, men will inevitably walk in the way of their wicked minds, until they are filled with their own devices.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed to ob&s;erve, that whatever be our cour&s;e, it will be fini&s;hed in a &s;hort time, either with joy or &s;orrow.</P>
<P>THIS demands our &s;erious thoughtfulne&s;s. Death is irre&s;i&s;tibly ravaging through the four quarters of the world: And <HI>Adam'</HI>s &s;ons, countle&s;s, are daily drop|ing off the globe:&mdash;Yea, the earth it&s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon come to a terrible di&s;&s;olution.&mdash;All things here below are temporary and tran&s;ient&mdash;every cour&s;er mu&s;t &s;oon arrive at his term&mdash;his days are as a &s;hadow&mdash;he con|tinueth for a little while and then vani&s;heth away.</P>
<P>VAST and infinite things do nearly and mo&s;t inti|mately concern us all; for we &s;tand hard by the &s;hore, and as at the very doors of eternity.&mdash;Were man's days an hundred years on the earth;&mdash;&s;till he has here no abiding place:&mdash;The end is by and by:&mdash;Time wings its way with &s;peed, and the extremity of our cour&s;e is ju&s;t at hand.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job. xvi. 22.</NOTE> <HI>When a few years are come I &s;hall go the way whence I &s;hall not return.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="017182_0009_0FA0737A0A494530">
OUR days on earth mu&s;t indeed be fini&s;hed &s;oon, becau&s;e our natures are &s;o very feeble and &s;ubject to decay, that upon the lea&s;t touch they totter to a fall: Our &s;inews are not as bra&s;s, nor our bones as iron: We continually feel our natures mortal.&mdash;Every pain and every ach in our bones or fle&s;h, is none other than death knocking at the door&mdash;Heralds proclaim|ing the approach of the king of terrors:&mdash;Our days are few&mdash;our race is &s;hort.&mdash;'As an eagle ha&s;teth to her prey, &s;o we &s;wiftly to our end.'</P>
<P>O WITH what &s;olemnity &s;hould our thoughts me|ditate the grand remove from this inch of time, to end|le&s;s eternity!</P>
<P>IF, pa&s;&s;ing from this world of incon&s;i&s;tencies and &s;or|rows, we make proportionate advance towards the man&s;ions in our father's hou&s;e, the pro&s;pect is delight|fully animating and joyful.&mdash;But otherwi&s;e, every &s;cene beyond time mu&s;t open with amazing terror: For if GOD's word may be credited, as our cour&s;e is, &s;o will be our end.</P>
<P>IT is mo&s;t evident, and yet &s;urprizing, that multi|tudes of men, po&s;ting to eternity, are altogether care|le&s;s and unconcerned about the cour&s;e they &s;teer. Ma|ny, alas! very many run a mad career&mdash;the danger of endle&s;s ruin hangs on every moment.&mdash;But a happy number there are, who being influenced by the &s;pirit of GOD, to faith and love, hope and confidence, upon a good foundation, &s;hall be &s;afe in the arms of immutability&mdash;Remove in peace to partake of the fruit of their hope

&mdash;the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls&mdash;an immortal fullne&s;s of joy.</P>
<P>THE Holy Gho&s;t is the mover of their cour&s;e&mdash;God's word their compa&s;s, and their haven, realms of bli&s;s; where mortality &s;hall be &s;wallowed up of life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 10.</NOTE>.&mdash;<HI>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</HI> Such are they who follow the lamb of GOD&mdash;they have hope in their death&mdash;well may they tri|umph in their de&s;olution.

<P><Q>O Chri&s;tian, that move&s;t thy cour&s;e aright, though briars and thorns were with thee on every &s;ide; yet thou maye&s;t be joyful in pa&s;&s;ing the rugged&mdash;gloomy vales, for that thy &s;orrows &s;hall &s;oon have an end, and thine expectations &s;hall not be cut off. And will it not joy thee, when arrived to thy father's hou&s;e, to review thy labours in watchings and warrings, the &s;uf|ferings of Chri&s;t my&s;tical, which were yet behind, having in part been filled up in thy pains? Now when thy tears, kept in his bottle, &s;hall be poured out for a te&s;timony in thy favour; Oh then! How exqui&s;ite the joy!

<P>THEREFORE, with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety is it a&s;&s;ert|ed&mdash;that &s;o to conduct in this life, as to fini&s;h their cour&s;e with joy, is of infinite importance to all.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="017182_0011_0FA0737DCEAC0EC8">
INDEED, my brethren, it &s;hould be the great con|cern and bu&s;ine&s;s of life, to &s;tudy and learn how to die in peace. No man is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of complete felicity on earth.</P>
<P>IT was the &s;aying of an antient Philo&s;opher,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Solont</HI></NOTE> that he could not pronounce a man happy, until he knew how he died. And by divine revelation, we are more abundantly certified of this truth; that he only is hap|py, who is found ready to depart and die, when his Lord &s;hall call for him.</P>
<P>'HE that &s;ecures the good part, and reaches the true evidence of his heavenly father's love; a ponderous crown of life is his &s;ure and everla&s;ting portion&mdash;He knows his Redeemer liveth, and as he liveth in Chri&s;t, &s;o death appears without a &s;ting; and his &s;oul is full of longings to depart and be with him.'</P>
<P>OH! thrice happy man, who&s;e lamp burns bright at the midnight of death.</P>
<P>IT is without di&s;pute, that the prize of our high call|ing in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is infinitely worthy of the inten&s;e care and &s;trenuous pur&s;uit of every man. Surprizing|ly &s;trange therefore, that the generality of mankind &s;hould be &s;o indifferent to, and &s;o negligent of, the in|valuable part!&mdash;Pa&s;&s;ing &s;wiftly to worlds of joy or woe, that they &s;hould be &s;o entirely thoughtle&s;s to which they go! Oh that the &s;pirit of the living GOD might effectually move upon their hearts; that, while time continues, they might awake from their delu&s;ive &s;lumbers&mdash;ari&s;e from the dead, and become living, ac|tive

in&s;truments of GOD's glory, and finally partakers of the happine&s;s which flows from his pre&s;ence and ap|probation.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, that any one (realizing his immortali|ty) &s;hould not de&s;ire to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxiii. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Die the death of the righteous, and &s;hat his la&s;t and might be like his?</HI></P>
<P>BUT what are the nece&s;&s;ary prerequi&s;ites to a joyful exit? In brief, they are &s;uch as &s;anctification by the di|vine &s;pirit&mdash;or a renewal and change of the temper of our hearts&mdash;or a being born again. As we all have partook of the corruption of nature by the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> which expo&s;es to complete wretchedne&s;s; &s;o every man, to become an heir of eternal glory, mu&s;t partake of a renovation of mind, according to the image of the &s;econd <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>THE bli&s;&s;ful Heaven of GOD's pre&s;ence, can be no place for the un&s;anctified and unholy.&mdash;<HI>The carnal mind is enmity to</HI> GOD. Hence the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of that &s;anctification by the &s;pirit of GOD; which conforms us to his divine likene&s;s, and influences to the exerci&s;es of tho&s;e graces, and the performance of tho&s;e duties, e&s;&s;ential to the Chri&s;tian character, that we may fini&s;h our cour&s;e with joy. <HI>Without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> We &s;hall therefore find the nece&s;&s;ity of repentence towards GOD, and faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; love to the divine character, perfections, laws and government; and benevolence to creatures; accompanied, with increa&s;ing affection to things &s;piritual, which are above; and proportionate
<PB N="15" REF="017182_0013_0FA0737F4F9FF060">
indifference to, and di&s;engagedne&s;s from the le&s;s im|portant, trifling and comparatively &s;mall objects and enjoyments of the pre&s;ent world.</P>
<P>ACCOMPANIED, with prayerfulne&s;s, watchfulne&s;s, activity, diligence and per&s;everance in the di&s;charge of the duties of life&mdash;duties which re&s;pect GOD, our neighbour and our&s;elves. We mu&s;t do ju&s;tice, love mercy, and walk humbly before GOD, &amp;c. in order to enter into the kingdom of Heaven; which &s;eat of ex|alted happine&s;s will not be indulged us, on account of any deeds in us, meriting GOD's favour, but &s;olely for the prevailing merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the pur|cha&s;er, grand medium, and end of our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH none will obtain eternal life for, or on account of, the exerci&s;e and performance of Chri&s;tian graces and duties; yet all, who from right principles obey, &s;hall through the infinite mediator, fini&s;h their cour&s;e with joy, and obtain a happy admi&s;&s;ion to glory: When, tho&s;e of a contrary character, who practi&s;e in|iquity, &s;hall be mi&s;erably excluded the realms of bli&s;&s;ful immortality.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi. 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>He that overcometh &s;hall inherit all things, and I will be his</HI> GOD <HI>and he &s;hall be my &s;on. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and &s;ocerers, and idolaters, and all liars, &s;hall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd death.</HI> Whoever, therefore, would wi&s;h to have his &s;un &s;erene and bright, (when the dark curtains of death

are gathering about him) and his eternity ble&s;&s;ed, let him be holy in heart, in life, and in all manner of con|ver&s;ation. This, without a laboured proof, appears to be of infinite importance to every man: But parti|cularly and very e&s;pecially.</P>
<P>TO Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, who&s;e great and main bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of GOD, <HI>i. e.</HI> the go&s;pel wherein the grace of GOD is publi&s;hed to a fallen, peri&s;hing world.</P>
<P>As the doctrines of this go&s;pel are infinitely concern|ing to men, &s;o the genuine and faithful preaching them is here con&s;idered by St. <HI>Paul</HI> as a matter of the high|e&s;t importance to him&s;elf, and others in the mini&s;try; a number of which, he now had an interview with. He intimates to them, that to bear a due te&s;timony to the doctrines of GOD's free grace (for which he was aware, the legalizing Jews would furiou&s;ly per&s;ecute him) was much dearer to him than life. Therefore, he was determined to publi&s;h the grace of GOD, bear witne&s;s to the truth of it, and pro&s;ecute his important errand, although it &s;hould prove to the peril of his life.</P>
<P>THE grace of GOD here mentioned, intimates the free and eternal love of GOD exhibited in the way of the new covenant.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the tenor of the fir&s;t covenant, fallen man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily relinqui&s;h all claim to the favour of GOD: The plan of the new covenant, on which a|lone, man can become a partaker of forfeited happi|ne&s;s, is wholly founded in grace. The gift of GOD's
<PB N="17" REF="017182_0015_0FA07380CCCEC730">
dear &s;on to a ruined world, is entirely the re&s;ult of pure, free, rich and &s;overeign grace. Herein are di&s;played the a&s;toni&s;hing wonders of the father's love; giving the immaculate &s;on, to become a &s;acrifice to divine ju&s;tice, that rebels might be redeemed to GOD.</P>
<P>As the purcha&s;e was free, &s;o is the be&s;towment of that grace which bringeth &s;alvation&mdash;the grace of GOD.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Who hath &s;aved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpo&s;e and grace, which was given us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us be|fore the world began.</HI></P>
<P>FURTHER, the grace of GOD intends the free impu|tation of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s; on account of which believers are reputed righteous in the &s;ight of GOD.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 26.</NOTE> <HI>To declare I &s;ay at this time his righteou&s;ne&s;s; that he might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him that believeth in Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, by the grace of GOD is de&s;igned the work of the &s;pirit in believers.</P>
<P>ALL the righteou&s;ne&s;s that is wrought in them, or by them, is the fruit of grace. From fir&s;t to la&s;t, from the foundation to the top&s;tone of our &s;alvation, it be|comes us to cry, grace&mdash;grace unto it. Yet the a&s;&s;ert|ers of the free grace of GOD wherein we &s;tand, fre|quently meet with unrea&s;onable treatment. The pride of the depraved heart can by no means reli&s;h tho&s;e &s;oul humbling doctrines of the go&s;pel, which place the &s;inner at GOD's foot, as helple&s;s and mi&s;era|ble in him&s;elf: Which bind him to the methods of

&s;overeign grace, and &s;hut him up to the faith of the go&s;|pel for &s;alvation: Which deny to the creature the honor of procuring his happine&s;s, and attribute the whole glo|ry to Jehovah: Which be&s;peak the whole oeconomy of redemption, the wonderous work of GOD. Hence, at the pre&s;ent day, &s;uch as te&s;tify the free grace of GOD, are by many, deemed &s;tupid and irrational&mdash;treated with &s;corn and contempt, as though babblers and fools.</P>
<P>BUT, as all religion which is evangelical and genu|ine, &s;tands upon this ba&s;is (the grace of GOD) &s;o it mu&s;t be in&s;i&s;ted on and te&s;tified. This is the go&s;pel which mu&s;t be preached to every creature, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, it is well atte&s;ted, and therefore may be boldly te&s;tified.</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel makes full proof, that being ju&s;tified freely by his grace, we have peace with GOD, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THEIR'S is another go&s;pel than that of GOD our &s;a|viour, which is not founded on the free grace of GOD. This is the only way in which our re&s;toration to holi|ne&s;s and happine&s;s can po&s;&s;ibly be accompli&s;hed. Wherefore, for a mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to believe, preach, practi&s;e and te&s;tify this go&s;pel of the grace of GOD, is the only way to fulful his mini&s;try, to &s;ave him&s;elf and them that hear him.</P>
<P>MINISTERS of the go&s;pel are &s;tiled Stewards; and as they are by Je&s;us entru&s;ted with the charge of his
<PB N="19" REF="017182_0017_0FA073824C3C5AD0">
oracles, ordinances, and the &s;ouls of men; to him they mu&s;t give an account of their &s;teward&s;hip; and how aggravatedly terrible their doom, if they corrupt the word of GOD! conceal divine truth! daub with un|tempered mortar! few pillows under arm-holes! di&s;|order the peace of the church! wa&s;te their time! abu&s;e talents!&mdash;or mi&s;improve opportunities, to &s;in|ful or in&s;ignificant purpo&s;es!</P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;hould they faithfully keep the tru&s;t committed to them: Should they &s;incerely &s;erve the Lord Je&s;us, in a bu&s;y, careful, plea&s;ing attention to the matters of his family&mdash;the great affairs of his church and kingdom; how joyfully may they expect to fini&s;h their cour&s;e, and the mini&s;try which they have received of the Lord! How rich will be the re|wards of divine grace upon them, who have faithfully te&s;tified the go&s;pel of the grace of GOD! They &s;hall be graciou&s;ly owned of their Lord, in the great day of his appearing; and with con&s;ummate glory enter into their ma&s;ter's joy. All important then is it to them, that they &s;o conduct in life&mdash;in their mini&s;try, as that approbation and joy may attend the completion of both.</P>
<P>TO CLOSE THE SUBJECT&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>My dear Friends,</HI></P>
<P>IS it not &s;uitable, while reflecting on what has been offered, and may it not be very advantageous, in an impartial, critical, &s;olemn manner, to examine our|&s;elves, and prove whether we be in the faith? of that
<PB N="20" REF="017182_0018_0FA073830A545538">
happy number, who are not greatly moved at any of the trying &s;cenes of time, but prepared to fini&s;h their cour&s;e with joy?</P>
<P>IT can not be otherwi&s;e, than a mo&s;t concerning, im|portant, intere&s;ting affair, to know how we have enter|tained the gracious offers and tenders of the go&s;pel of the grace of GOD&mdash;whether in vain. Recollect that particu|lar declaration of GOD our &s;aviour;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>This is the con|demnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved. But he that doeth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manife&s;t, that they are wrought in</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel of GOD's free grace hath been preached and te&s;tified to us: To reflect then, that we have &s;light|ed, contemned, or neglected it, may well &s;trike us with fear and trembling.</P>
<P>LET us all call our&s;elves to account, and put the &s;o|lemn query, how we have believed and practi&s;ed;&mdash;impartially enquire what effect the go&s;pel of divine grace hath had on our hearts and lives; what we have been doing in the world; and whether, we are now bending our cour&s;e.</P>
<P>IT will &s;oon terminate in joy or &s;orrow&mdash;What are the paths in which we walk? What is the main &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s of life? He that believeth, and endureth
<PB N="21" REF="017182_0019_0FA07383CC396500">
to the end, the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;aved: He that be|lieveth not, but practi&s;eth iniquity, &s;hall be damned&mdash;mu&s;t fini&s;h his cour&s;e in mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>LET every one, critically &s;earch his heart, and try his own ways; knowing that in a very &s;hort time, his &s;teward&s;hip will be ended, and his pre&s;ent &s;tate of trial be re&s;olved into a &s;tate of eternal retribution.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, let us behave as men, who are truly concerned for the honour of GOD and the welfare of our immortal &s;ouls; and who have received the grace of GOD not in vain, but to holine&s;s of life. And by all means be careful, that we make full proof of the reality of our high calling in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, by all go&s;|pel obedience.</P>
<P>IF this wi&s;dom have a re&s;idence in our hearts; if this under&s;tanding be plea&s;ant to our &s;ouls, it &s;hall pre|&s;erve and keep us.</P>
<P>NOW is the time, if we would work the work of GOD: Now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of &s;alvation; and on the wi&s;e improvement of it, much depends, even our happine&s;s in death, and forever.</P>
<P>LET us look well to this, that we believingly, hum|bly and thankfully entertain the te&s;timony of GOD's free grace, as manife&s;tly exhibited, in the go&s;pel of his dear &s;on; wherein rich and full provi&s;ion is made for the happine&s;s and glory of the mo&s;t unworthy and help|le&s;s of the human race. Ble&s;&s;ed are they who hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s: Who rely on the in|fluence

<P>LET it be the &s;olemn concern of every &s;oul&mdash;to de|ny them&s;elves&mdash;take up the cro&s;s and follow after Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;To deny, all ungodline&s;s and every world|ly lu&s;t&mdash;to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent evil world:&mdash;that they may evidence the vir|tues of him who invites them to his kingdom and glo|ry. As a means of incitement to this, let us keep in view the end of our cour&s;e&mdash;the &s;olemn account we are to give, to the Judge of quick and dead, of every thought and word, and all the actions done here in the body&mdash;The fearful &s;ituation of a Chri&s;tle&s;s &s;inner, at the verge of life, having rejected the coun&s;el of GOD again&s;t his own &s;oul. Had he not refu&s;ed the gracious tenders of reconciliation, pardon and peace, he might have been a &s;aint in Heaven: But he would not come to Chri&s;t that he might have life: And what can he now expect, but to &s;uffer the ju&s;t rewards of his folly and madne&s;s! O wretched his &s;tate!</P>
<P>ON the other hand how un&s;peakable the joy, of a child of GOD, with clear and ravi&s;hing views of the better world&mdash;&s;en&s;ible that he is returning to his father's hou&s;e&mdash;the man&s;ions of bli&s;s made ready by the di|vine Je&s;us for all his followers!</P>
