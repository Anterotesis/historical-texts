<P>ALICE CLIFTON, late of the county of Philadelphia, &s;lave of John Bartholomew, was indicted for the murder of her female child, on the 5th in&s;tant, which was born a ba&s;tard; and that &s;he, with a certain razor, of the value of one &s;hilling, did, in, upon, and acro&s;s the throat of the &s;aid child, feloniou&s;ly, wil|fully, and of malice afore-thought, did penetrate, and cut, with the razor afore&s;aid, one mortal wound, of the length of four inches, and of the depth of one inch; of which &s;aid mortal wound, the &s;aid female child then and there in&s;tantly did die.</P>
<P>The Attorney-general managed the trial on behalf of the &s;tate, and Me&s;&s;rs. Sergeant and Todd were employed for the pri&s;oner. The fol|lowing witne&s;&s;es appeared, and depo&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>John Leacock, Coroner, &s;worn.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Well, Mr. Leacock, what do you know of this affair? I know very little more, than that while the inque&s;t were examining the child, I di&s;covered that its throat had been cut. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Did you &s;ay any thing to her, or a&s;k her any que&s;tions? She was a&s;ked, how &s;he come to kill her child? and an&s;wered, that it was in order to keep it from crying. I was informed by Mr. Bartholomew, that the body was di&s;covered, under &s;ome cloaths, in a che&s;t. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he &s;ay, that &s;he was the mother? I did not a&s;k her. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;You &s;ay, that &s;he &s;aid &s;he cut the child's throat to prevent its crying, when you di&s;covered that it had been cut? It was not me who found it out; it was one of the jury, while they were examining it. <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he &s;ay &s;he cut its throat to prevent its crying, or for fear it &s;hould cry? I am not po|&s;itive, but believe it was to keep it from crying: &s;he &s;aid too, that &s;he had done it by the order or expre&s;s command of the father of the child. She was then a&s;ked, who the father was? and &s;he mentioned his name. <HI>Court</HI>&mdash;Who did &s;he &s;ay was the father? She mentioned his
<PB N="2" REF="020275_0002_0FAE9C6074E38530">
name. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;What name did &s;he mention? She &s;aid it was John Shaffer. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;What el&s;e happened? That is all I know. What child was it, male or female? It was a female child. Did it appear to be a likely child? Yes. Was the hair and nails grown, and did it look as if it had come to its full time? The hair and nails were grown, but I did not examine it particularly, as I made no que&s;tion but it had gone the full time. Is the pri&s;oner at the bar the &s;ame woman that you then &s;aw? Yes. Did you a&s;k her if it was born-alive? Yes: &s;he was a&s;ked &s;everal times, but always &s;aid it was born dead. And was &s;he not then a&s;ked, if it was born dead, what was her rea&s;on for cutting its throat, and &s;he an&s;wered it was to prevent its crying? I believe that que&s;tion was a&s;ked, and &s;he might have an&s;wered &s;o; but I could not hear, as there were a great number of people in the room, &s;o that I was crouded up in a corner, as the room was but &s;mall. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;If the room was &s;o &s;mall you could hear the better, I &s;hould think. <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he &s;ay whether the child cried or not? No: &s;he &s;aid it was born dead. Was the child cold or warm, when you was there? I did not feel it. Did &s;he &s;ay &s;he cut its throat for fear it would cry? Yes, I think &s;he did. Did &s;he mention any arguments which the father had u&s;ed to induce her to commit &s;uch a crime? I know nothing further: Captain Bullfinch was there, and he heard what &s;he &s;aid on that &s;ubject. Did you take any examination in writing, at the time? No. Well but you &s;hould on &s;uch important occa&s;ion. I did not know it was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P><HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Are you the mi&s;tre&s;s of that woman? Yes, Sir. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Look, and &s;ee if it is the &s;ame. She is, Sir. When did you di&s;cover her to be with child? About five or &s;ix months ago. Did you charge her with it? Yes, Sir. Did &s;he own it? No: &s;he &s;aid &s;he was not. Did you charge her more than once? Yes; but &s;he con&s;tantly denied it. What happened the morning that &s;he was delivered? I don't know, for I did not &s;ee her till twelve o'clock, when I went up to her, and &s;he complained of being unwell. Had &s;he not been up that morn|ing? Yes: &s;he got up and made the fire in the parlour, and afterward &s;he went and laid down. What did you &s;ay to her, when you went up? I a&s;ked her what was the matter? and &s;he &s;aid &s;he was poorly. I told her that I &s;u&s;pected &s;he was with child, but &s;he denied it. Well, what further? I then left her, Sir: I thought &s;he was in that &s;ituation, and &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pect &s;he was in labour. Was &s;he laying in the bed, or on the bed? She was lying under the clothes; in about an hour I went up again. What did you di&s;cover then? She &s;eemed much the &s;ame: I a&s;ked her the &s;ame que&s;tion, and &s;he told me again, that &s;he was not with child: I went down directly, and in about a quarter of an hour I went up again, and &s;he a&s;ked me for &s;ome old cloaths to put on: &s;he told me that &s;he felt better. Where was &s;he when you came up? She was walking about the room: I told her I &s;u&s;pected &s;he had a child, but &s;he denied it &s;till; but I &s;earched about in the clo&s;et, and in the

chimney. <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he appear di&s;turbed while you was &s;earch|ing? No: &s;he &s;aid nothing. Where was the child found? My &s;i&s;ter-in-law found it in a trunk in another room. Did &s;he bring the child to the mother? Yes; &s;he brought it her&s;elf. Well, what more? I re|tired from the room. Did you &s;ee the child? I ju&s;t ca&s;t my eye on it. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Did you &s;ee any wound upon it? No: I &s;aw none. Well, what further? [Mr. Bartholomew &s;aid they were all &s;o affected, that they could not bear to remain in the room. Mrs. Bartholomew was al&s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed.] Did you di&s;cover any blood about the cloaths? No. <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;When you &s;aid &s;he a&s;ked you for cloaths, did you un|der&s;tand cloaths for her&s;elf, or for the child? For her&s;elf. <HI>Sergeant,</HI> being council for the pri&s;oner.&mdash;When &s;he a&s;ked you for old cloaths, did &s;he not let you know that &s;he had a child? No, Sir. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Had &s;he &s;ufficient cloaths always before? Yes, Sir. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Pray, did you know of her having received any hurt, previous to her delivery? Yes; about a month. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;You'll plea&s;e, Madam, to relate the circum&s;tances to the Court and Jury. About a month or &s;o before, &s;he fell down the cellar-&s;tairs, with a log of wood in her arms. <HI>Ser|geant.</HI>&mdash;Was &s;he much brui&s;ed by the accident? Yes, Sir, a good deal on her hip. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Do you know of any other hurt &s;he received? She was hurt a few days before. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he complain much of the brui&s;e? Yes, Sir, &s;he complained for a week or two after. Did &s;he keep her bed? No, Sir. <HI>Todd,</HI> being al&s;o council for the pri&s;oner.&mdash;Pray, Madam, where was the girl, when you went up to &s;ee her, about twelve o'clock?&mdash;Was &s;he in the garret or &s;econd &s;tory? She was lying on a bed, in a room on the &s;econd &s;tory. Is that the u&s;ual room where &s;he &s;leeps? No, Sir. Who &s;leeps in that room? My bro|ther, and the boys of the &s;hop. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Where was you about the time &s;he was delivered? We were eating dinner in the parlour. How far is that room from where the girl lay? The room was exactly over|head; we were in the room under her. <HI>Todd.</HI>&mdash;Is the ceiling of the room high or low? It is middling. Is it not one of tho&s;e old-fa&s;hioned hou&s;es, where the ceilings are built much lower than is common now? Yes, Sir. Were the doors open? Yes; the room-door was open. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Did you hear the child cry? No: I heard no noi&s;e at all. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Don't you think you could have heard the child, had it cried? I believe I could. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Was &s;he ever in bed in that room before? No. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;Where was the room in which the child was found? It was oppo&s;ite to this, and on the &s;ame floor. Did you hear her when &s;he carried it there, and put it into the che&s;t? No. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he appear very ill, when you fir&s;t &s;aw her? Yes; &s;he was very poorly. <HI>Todd.</HI>&mdash;This is the room, you &s;ay, where the boys u&s;ually lodged? Yes. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Did you know whether their razors were lying about? Yes; they were in the window: there were two razors laying there. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;How came &s;he to go into that room? After &s;he had made a fire in the morning, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he found her&s;elf unwell, and went in there to lay down: I know no other rea|&s;on.

<HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;You &s;ay it is about five or &s;ix months ago that you fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected her to be with child: pray, from what &s;ymp|toms was it that you &s;u&s;pected? From her appearance. Was there no particular &s;ymptom, or &s;omething in her conduct, which led you to &s;u&s;pect? Nothing but her being a little &s;ick, and from appearance. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;What, &s;ick at her &s;tomach? Yes. <HI>Attorney-gene|ral.</HI>&mdash;Did you employ a Doctor for her, when &s;he fell down &s;tairs? No: &s;he was not confined. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;She went about as u&s;ual, and did middling well? She kept up and went about all the time, but &s;till complained. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;And how has &s;he been &s;ince &s;he was delivered, pretty hearty? I don't know; &s;he went from our hou&s;e &s;hortly after. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;At the time you fir&s;t &s;u&s;|pected her being with child, you &s;aid you founded your opinion upon her appearance; do you mean by that, that you di&s;covered it by her bulk? Yes. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Her bulk, Madam, was not the fir&s;t cau&s;e of your &s;u&s;picion, but her &s;ickne&s;s, and afterward her bulk? Yes, Sir. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Can you &s;et the time, when you fir&s;t ob&s;erved this? Not exactly. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;When you perceived her &s;ickne&s;s, did you not al&s;o ob&s;erve her increa&s;e of bulk? No; not then.</P>

<P><HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;You found the child? Yes, Sir. Where? In a trunk in the room oppo&s;ite to where &s;he was: it was wrapped up in a petticoat belonging to her. How did the child get in the trunk? I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he mu&s;t have carried it there her&s;elf: when I was &s;earching about in the trunk, I a&s;ked her what was in the petticoat? when I laid my hand upon it; but &s;he &s;aid nothing. Was the petticoat at the top of the trunk? No; it was under a large roll of linen. Did &s;he &s;ay any thing, when you a&s;ked her what was in the petticoat? No. Whether did &s;he de&s;ire you to open the petticoat or not? No: &s;he opened it her&s;elf, and laid it upon the bed a&s;ide of her: I a&s;ked her if &s;he had killed the child? and &s;he &s;aid, Yes: I a&s;ked her how? and &s;he &s;aid &s;he had laid on it, but could not help it. <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;Did you di&s;cover any marks of violence upon the body? No. You &s;aw the child? Yes: &s;he opened the petticoat, and laid the child with it on the bed, and &s;at by its &s;ide. Did nothing further happen? The Jury was &s;ent for, and came in, and I retired from the room. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;Did it ap|pear a fine, plump child? I am not a judge: I can't &s;ay any thing of it. <HI>Todd.</HI>&mdash;Can you recollect the time the child was brought out of the trunk? It was about two o'clock. <HI>Todd.</HI>&mdash;After you di&s;covered the child, was not &s;he left alone with it? Yes: I went down to &s;peak to my &s;i&s;ter. What length of time was you ab&s;ent? I believe about ten minutes. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;When you put your hand upon it in the trunk, did it feel warm? <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;If your Honor plea&s;es, &s;he &s;ays it was wrapt up in a petticoat. Well, did you feel it warm through the petticoat? Yes, Sir, I believe it was. She took the child in the pet|ticoat into the other room? I believe &s;he did. How long did you &s;tay with her? About ten minutes. <HI>Todd.</HI>&mdash;And then went down for ten

Yes. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Had it hair and nails perfect? I can't &s;ay: I believe it had nails. <HI>Ser|geant.</HI>&mdash;Pray, Ma'am, do you know any thing of a hurt &s;he received?

<P>When I went up into the room, I found her &s;itting on the floor, with the child leaning over her arm; &s;he kept its head clo&s;e down on its brea&s;t. The Inque&s;t a&s;ked her, if &s;he had u&s;ed no violence to the child? and &s;he &s;aid, No. It was the fir&s;t time &s;he had ever had a child, and &s;he believed &s;he had overlaid it. At this time there ap|peared no marks of violence, or they were not di&s;covered. Mr. <HI>Na|glee,</HI> or <HI>Norgrove,</HI> (we don't know which he named) was the fir&s;t, who, on examining the child, di&s;covered that the throat was cut. He a&s;ked her, how the throat came to be cut? and &s;he &s;aid &s;he did it her&s;elf with a razor. She was a&s;ked, where the razor was? and I un|der&s;tood that one Bryan O'Connor, and &s;ome other, had been there, and taken it away. However, the razor was produced, and &s;he was a&s;ked, if that was the razor? She &s;aid, Yes. We a&s;ked her, how &s;he came to cut its throat? and &s;he &s;aid, for fear it &s;hould cry, and the family would hear it. I ob&s;erved to her, that if the child was born dead, as &s;he &s;aid it was, that there was no occa&s;ion to cut its throat. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Did the child appear bloody? No; it appeared as if it had been wa&s;hed. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he &s;ay the child was born dead? Yes: &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in it, that it was born dead; that is, that &s;he overlaid it. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Had it the appearance of having come to maturity? Why, I thought it appeared plump and hearty. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Do you recol|lect, whether &s;he &s;aid any thing further? Yes; &s;he &s;aid &s;he was told to do it. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he &s;ay by whom? Yes. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he mention any promi&s;es that had been made her? She &s;aid &s;ome were made. What were they? She &s;aid that he promi&s;ed her, if &s;he made away with the child, &s;he &s;hould have her time purcha&s;ed, and he would &s;et her at liberty. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he &s;ay &s;he was to be pro|vided for? Yes: &s;he was to have fine cloaths, and to live like a lady. <HI>Jury.</HI>&mdash;Who&s;e name did &s;he mention as the father who had promi&s;ed this? John Shaffer, and &s;aid it was him who had de&s;ired her to cut the child's throat, or make away with it.</P>

<P>What I have to declare in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, is merely matter of opinion founded on ob&s;ervation, and what my profe&s;&s;ion teaches me to decide. I &s;aw the mother a few minutes after the Inque&s;t had been held, and &s;he informed me it was born dead. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;You are not to relate what &s;he &s;aid afterward, as that cannot be received as
<PB N="6" REF="020275_0006_0FAE9C65CA37FB68">
evidence. Well then, Sir, from the &s;ize and appearance of the child, I &s;aw enough to convince me that it was not born alive: it is true its throat was cut, and it had been taken away from the mother, and pre|&s;erved in &s;pirits by Dr. Foulke. <HI>Attorney-gen.</HI>&mdash;Doctor, pray when did you &s;ee the child fir&s;t? The day after the Inque&s;t. <HI>Attorney-gen.</HI>&mdash;If that is the ca&s;e, it can have little to do with the &s;ubject. Why, Sir, an opinion is as well to be formed from the &s;ize of the child then, as at the fir&s;t minute&mdash;And I am convinced it was not a full grown child; for it was too &s;mall, and there was little hair on its head, not near &s;o much as when an infant has come to its full time of birth. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;But is not the mother a very little woman? No: &s;he is not very little; &s;he is about the middling &s;ize. She is very young tho'? (Her age, Mr. Milne who brought her up, &s;aid, was &s;eventeen, wanting two months.) <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;Is this a &s;ubject on which you can form an opinion perfectly &s;atisfactory to your&s;elf? Yes, Sir; and of which I have no doubt. Was the windpipe cut through from &s;ide to &s;ide? Yes, it was, and the other large ve&s;&s;els were &s;eparated; and it mu&s;t have killed the child, had it been alive at the time; but I am of opinion it was dead, and born dead from the accident which had hap|pened to its mother, and from the &s;ize and appearance of the child. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;Can you, from appearances or &s;uch circum&s;tances, determine whether the child was born dead or alive? Yes: I can de|termine for my&s;elf, and am perfectly &s;atisfied of the conclu&s;ion. This child had not the appearance of a full grown child; it was of too &s;mall a &s;ize, and had not the u&s;ual quantity of hair on its head, and the inferior limbs were much too &s;mall, if compared with the nobler. How long may the infant remain in the womb after it is dead? I have known in&s;tances of their being retained a long time. Could it be a month? Yes; more than a month or &s;ix weeks either. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Suppo&s;e, Doctor, a child to be born dead, would it bleed on cutting its throat? Yes; and many per&s;ons do bleed after they are dead, on opening a &s;mall vein only. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;But, Doctor, not after having lain &s;o long as a month or &s;ix weeks in the womb? No; I don't &s;ay that: much depends on the habit of body, and there are various con&s;titutions. This child does not appear to be within two months at lea&s;t of its full time. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;But did you never &s;ee a &s;even months child make a good man? I don't &s;ay &s;o: there are certainly &s;uch, but they are to be found very &s;eldom. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Can you judge better from the comparative &s;ize of the limbs than from the length of the in|fant? <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Did the child appear to have fallen away much, when you &s;aw it? No. What was the cau&s;e of its premature birth? The mother told me, that &s;he had received a very &s;evere fall in lifting a log. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;You mu&s;t not repeat what &s;he told you. Well but, Sir, it was confirmed to me by the te&s;timony of her ma&s;ter; and &s;oon after &s;he &s;aid &s;he was &s;eized with the pains of labour. <HI>Attorney-gene|ral.</HI>&mdash;Did this conver&s;ation happen on the &s;ame day &s;he was delivered? It did? <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;But we have nothing of this &s;econd hurt in

te&s;timony. If you have not, I &s;uppo&s;e you will; for I under&s;tood &s;he had received two falls, and the Jury will be &s;atisfied in this point, when they come to hear her ma&s;ter; and I under&s;tood &s;he had a fall, or &s;evere &s;train, the very morning of her delivery.</P>

<HEAD>Doctor Foulke affirmed.</HEAD>
<P>I was called upon by the Coroner and the Inque&s;t, to examine the dead body of a child &s;uppo&s;ed to have been murdered. Before I got there, &s;everal per&s;ons on the inque&s;t had examined and found the throat cut. The murder of the child was no longer with me a que&s;tion, at lea&s;t &s;o far as the efforts of the mother had been able to effect it; and I left the Coroner and Jury to do their duty in an affair which appeared &s;o clear and plain. But after they had left the room, I returned to examine the mother, and to explain to her, her dangerous &s;ituation; but I was induced to doubt the validity of my fir&s;t opinion, when &s;he informed me with re&s;pect to the time of conception, the time of deli|very, the circum&s;tances which prematurely brought on the birth of the child, and from the appearance of the child afterward; from all of which con&s;iderations I believe my&s;elf ab&s;olutely ju&s;tifiable in declaring that the child mu&s;t have been born dead: the delicacy nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved, will make me &s;ay as little as is po&s;&s;ible on this occa&s;ion. With regard to the time of conception, it mu&s;t have been about the latter end of the month of September. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;How do you know that? The girl told me &s;o. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;But you are not to repeat what &s;he told you. Then, from the appearance of the child, I believe it to be only a &s;ix or &s;even months conception, which brings it to about that time. I keep the child for the purpo&s;e of exa|mining it fully, and of &s;hewing it to Doctor Jones: the Honorable Court, and the Jury may &s;ee it al&s;o if the Court plea&s;es; and by re|ferring to it, they will be able to judge for them&s;elves in &s;ome degree from its &s;ize. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;Does it not le&s;&s;en by being kept in &s;pirits? It does not grow bigger. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;But does it not le&s;&s;en? Yes, &s;omething. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;Does it much or little? But little: when Doctor Jones &s;aw it, it had not le&s;&s;ened, for I was obliged to extract it with forceps from the jar in which I put it. <HI>Ser|geant.</HI>&mdash;From all the circum&s;tances you have mentioned, do you &s;ay you are ju&s;tifiable in concluding that it was born dead? I do. Pray, when was you called in? About two hours after the child was born. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;But you then was not of opinion, that it was born dead? Whent I went, and &s;aw, and heard that &s;he had cut the child's throat, I formed my opinion on that circum&s;tance only, and I believe the Inque&s;t did the &s;ame without enquiring whether it was likely to have been born dead or not. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;You &s;ay from its &s;ize, that it was not a full grown child; are not &s;ome children &s;maller than others? Clearly, Sir, this is not a child that ought to be produced by its mo|ther, after nine months ge&s;tation. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Do not children live who are born at &s;even months? Children have lived who were born at &s;ix months; but &s;uch examples are very rare, and &s;eldom happen, and
<PB N="8" REF="020275_0008_0FAE9C67F2EADDC8">
cannot affect the pre&s;ent que&s;tion: they are like mon&s;ters&mdash;I don't mean that they are deformed, but they are not perfect, and are extra|ordinary things, rarely to be met with, not one in a hundred.&mdash;I have compared this child with &s;everal others which I have pre&s;erved, (as I have them of almo&s;t every period of conception) and I find that it is not the child by two or three months, which ought to be relea&s;ed after nine months ge&s;tation. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Do you believe a dead child might bleed on having its throat cut? I do: the blood of children is much finer and more fluid than that of men. Such are the di&s;po&s;itions of nature, in accommodating the cau&s;e to the effect; the blood of in|fants circulate through innumerable &s;ubtile canals, which a more gro&s;s fluid would ob&s;truct: but it is not only the throat of a child that would bleed on being cut after it was dead, but al&s;o of a man, or indeed of any animal. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;Did you di&s;cover any blood about the child, when you fir&s;t &s;aw it? I did a little, not more than is cu&s;|tomary; for it is well known that more or le&s;s is always di&s;charged by the mother on the&s;e occa&s;ions&mdash;This is a &s;ubject that delicacy and re|&s;pect makes it difficult to &s;peak of&mdash;but the Honorable Court will ex|cu&s;e me. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;It is nece&s;&s;ary to be explicit, and relate things as they are, &s;o that you &s;tand in need of no excu&s;e. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he &s;ay the child was born dead? Yes. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;You are not to &s;ay any thing &s;he &s;aid, after the Inque&s;t had &s;at. I believe the gen|tlemen have related that they heard her &s;ay &s;o. The rea&s;on why I did not, was, the woman was then in &s;uch a &s;ituation of body and mind, that humanity and every generous feeling for an unhappy creature for|bid to add to her pain and care, and therefore made it expedient to leave the room: but afterward when the poignancy of her di&s;tre&s;s might be alleviated, I called and attended to her narration, which I am not, you &s;ay, to relate. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he appear very feeble? She was &s;etting up, but then it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould, as the room was much crouded, and the people pre&s;&s;ing about her. When I had heard her relate the particulars of her &s;ituation, I went home, and made notes of it, from which I could explain my &s;everal rea&s;ons for concluding, that the child could not be born alive. [Mr. Bullfinch was called, and a&s;ked if &s;he &s;aid it was born dead? He an&s;wered, Yes; and that &s;he had lifted up the lid of its eye, but it fell down again&mdash;This &s;he &s;aid before it was di&s;covered that the throat was cut.] <HI>Ser|geant.</HI>&mdash;Did you ob&s;erve, Doctor, that the limbs of the child were not proportioned? Yes: the hands, arms, legs, and other inferior limbs, were too &s;mall when compared with the others. There are too, many circum&s;tances of evidence, which would confirm the ju&s;tne&s;s of the conclu&s;ion drawn by Doctor Jones and my&s;elf, with re&s;pect to the child's having been born dead: there are al&s;o other matters which I could mention, but from the delicacy and tenderne&s;s with which it is requi&s;ite to &s;peak on this &s;ubject. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Our great object is inform|ation, and nothing &s;hould prevent our obtaining the fulle&s;t. Well, then, as this woman was delivered alone of a feeble and imperfect child,
<PB N="9" REF="020275_0009_0FAE9C68CB42E770">
and as &s;he informs me, &s;he lay upon her back at the time of its birth, then had the child been alive, but come in the common or ordinary way into the world. You know that it is nece&s;&s;ary that its eyes, its no&s;e and mouth, in &s;hort its face, mu&s;t have been towards the po&s;terior parts of the mother, and in this &s;ituation of relea&s;e&mdash;it is more than probable that the child might have been &s;mothered in the birth; nay, it is a certainty, that it mu&s;t have been &s;mothered from the want of a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to extricate it, and from its long continuance in that &s;ituation&punc; <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he &s;eem to be affected for the lo&s;s of her child? She &s;eem|ed to me to have lo&s;t her&s;elf much; &s;he &s;troaked it, and looked at it, but I thought not with that maternal tenderne&s;s, which &s;he &s;hould have di&s;covered on &s;uch an occa&s;ion: &s;he &s;hed no tears for her lo&s;s; not that I e&s;teem the &s;hedding tears an e&s;&s;ential to con&s;titute tenderne&s;s. She began to appear &s;orry, when I was about to take the infant from her. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Did &s;he &s;ay why &s;he cut its throat? Yes: &s;he &s;aid that John Shaffer, the fat Shaffer, was the father of it, and he had per&s;uaded her to kill it; if &s;he did, he would purcha&s;e her freedom, and that he was to marry a fine woman, and that he would make her then as happy and as fine as his wife, and that if &s;he did not do it, &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer immen&s;e|ly&mdash;but if &s;he did, &s;he had nothing to fear, for there was no heaven or hell, no God or devil that he knew better than any body el&s;e, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more learning than any other man, and had travelled in Eu|rope; and to encourage her, he &s;aid that it was no harm, and he had per&s;uaded a milk-girl to do the like once before. I examined her to know the time of her conception, and &s;he told me that it was &s;ome|time after her ma&s;ter went to live in Church-alley. She remembered&punc; it was &s;ometime in the latter end of September, when &s;he fir&s;t was de|bauched by him on their lot, and that &s;he &s;oon di&s;covered her &s;ituation; that &s;he went on as women u&s;ually do, until about three weeks before her delivery, when &s;he was helping in with a cord of wood, &s;he re|ceived a con&s;iderable injury by the fall of a log upon her hip; that two or three days before &s;he was delivered, &s;he unfortunately met with a fall down &s;tairs, when her ma&s;ter &s;aw her; that &s;he found her&s;elf in|di&s;po&s;ed in the morning, and &s;trained her&s;elf in getting up a large back|log, which immediately ha&s;tened on the labour-pains, and an abortion came on about two o'clock; that &s;he was in great agony until then, and &s;he after that laid quiet half an hour, when &s;he took it up in her arms, and lifted its right eye-lid, but which fell down in&s;tantly: &s;he there|fore &s;u&s;pecting that it might be dead, and recollecting the promi&s;ed re|ward offered by Shaffer, and her promi&s;e to him, and fearing that it might cry and alarm the family, &s;he took up a razor laying by accident in the window by the bed-&s;ide, and cut its throat through, and cut even the very bone; but the blood that di&s;charged, was very &s;mall, and there mu&s;t have been &s;ome mi&s;take about its being wa&s;hed&mdash;for when I &s;aw it, it was as is u&s;ual with children after their birth; but perhaps the rags, or things it had been wrapped up in, might have ab|&s;orbed &s;ome, and given the appearance of wiping or wa&s;hing. She
<PB N="10" REF="020275_0010_0FAE9C6B0A5E9E08">
&s;aid &s;he laid &s;till half an hour after the birth; if &s;o, there can be no doubt but it was dead, and &s;he declared that it neither breathed or or cried. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;You &s;ay you have the child yet; how is it pre|&s;erved? In a gla&s;s jar, and I'll &s;end it, if you plea&s;e, to the Jury. Can't it be brought to Court? Yes, Sir. <HI>Todd.</HI>&mdash;If your Honors plea&s;e, it can be &s;ent to the jury-room. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;If we plea&s;e to &s;ee, why may we not? Well, Sir, I will &s;end it.</P>
<P>Accordingly the child was brought into Court, in a large gla&s;s jar, and Doctor Foulke had &s;ent with it a pair of forceps to extract it, if it &s;hould be deemed nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>I went up &s;tairs and found the girl &s;etting up, and the Jury were there; I was on the Inque&s;t al&s;o. When I &s;aw the child was dead, I a&s;ked her if &s;he knew who was the father? She an&s;wered, Yes. And a&s;ked her what his name was? She told me John Shaffer. I told her that &s;he &s;hould be careful in what &s;he &s;aid, and not charge any body unle&s;s &s;he was certain of them. <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;Did you a&s;k her how &s;he was delivered? Yes; and &s;he &s;aid &s;he was delivered upon her back. I a&s;ked her if &s;he heard the child cry? and &s;he &s;aid No. I a&s;ked her if &s;he had told her ma&s;ter, that &s;he was with child? and &s;he told me No. I &s;aid &s;he ought, and not have concealed it. I left her a little while, when I returned, and examined the child, but could di&s;cover no marks of violence upon it, until I happened to lift up its head, and then I perceived its throat was cut from here to here, [making a motion with his hand acro&s;s his throat.] I then told her, that &s;he had murdered the child, and de&s;erved to be puni&s;hed. I a&s;ked her how &s;he did it? and &s;he confe&s;&s;ed &s;he did it with a razor. I a&s;ked her where it was? and was informed that one O'Bryan, or O'Conner, or &s;ome &s;uch name, had taken it away; but the razor was got, and I looked at it, and &s;aw it had been wiped, but &s;till there was &s;ome little blood left on the point. I a&s;ked her how &s;he came to de&s;troy the child in that cruel manner? and &s;he &s;aid that &s;he was directed by the father, and told to pinch its throat, which would effectually de&s;troy it. She told me, that he was concerned with her in Church-alley. I a&s;ked her when &s;he had &s;een him la&s;t? She &s;aid &s;he had not &s;een him lately. I a&s;ked her if &s;he had &s;een him &s;ince he was concerned with her in the alley? and &s;he &s;aid &s;he had &s;everal times, but not lately; &s;he believed he was not in town. I a&s;ked her particularly what Shaffer it was? and &s;he told me the one that married Chavilier's daughter. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Did you a&s;k her if the child was born dead? No: &s;he &s;aid it was dead, and I a&s;ked her why &s;he cut its throat when it was dead? It &s;eemed as if nature had helped the birth, for it came very plain. What do you mean by its coming very plain, that it was come to its full time? I believe it was very near about that. Did &s;he &s;ay &s;he was delivered on her back? Yes; but I know it could not be &s;o, and I told Doctor Jones, that it could not be born in that way without help. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;And what did Doctor Jones &s;ay?

<HEAD>Mr. Bartholomew &s;worn.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Where do you live? At the corner of Market and Second-&s;treet. Was it in your hou&s;e this unfortunate accident happened? Yes. How long have you lived there? It is near nine months. Did you bring up the girl? No, Sir: I have had her about three years; &s;he was brought up by Mr. Milne, my wife's father. Did you not live in Church-alley? Yes: I moved in there about eight or nine months ago. How long did you live there? Three months. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;Do you know any thing of any hurt the girl received before this accident? Yes; &s;omewhere about a month before &s;he was delivered, it could not be a week under or over, &s;he fell down with a &s;tick of wood in my hearing, and when I went to &s;ee what was the matter, &s;he was &s;itting crying, and complained &s;he was hurt much. Again, about three nights before this happened. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;What, before the other acci|dent, or before her delivery? Before her delivery, Sir. We had moving narrow &s;teps to go into the cellar, and I went my&s;elf, and held the candle to light her down to bring up a &s;tick of wood; and in lifting or getting up the &s;tick, &s;he fell down, and the &s;tick fell upon her: &s;he cried, and &s;at &s;everal minutes before &s;he got up. She &s;aid no more afterward, nor I heard no more about it. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;Did you &s;ee the child? Yes: I &s;aw it, but did not examine it. Did you ever enquire of her, if &s;he was not with child? Yes: I have charged her often with it. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;Did you di&s;cover &s;he was with child from her bulk? Yes. When did you di&s;cover it by her bulk? Before we left Church-alley. <HI>Attorney-general.</HI>&mdash;And how long have you lived where you now re&s;ide? Near nine months. How long did you live in Church-alley? Three months. <HI>Sergeant.</HI>&mdash;What, Sir, is it nine months &s;ince you left Church-alley? No; it is about &s;even months. I had both hou&s;es at once&mdash;the one at Market-&s;treet I occu|pied for a &s;tore&mdash;the one in Church-alley was my dwelling hou&s;e. <HI>Court.</HI>&mdash;And how long is it &s;ince you moved into the &s;hop?

<P>Whereupon Mr. Bartholomew went to fetch it; but before he re|turned, the Council had gone through much of their pleadings, and he was only examined touching the time; when it appeared he had went into Church-alley the 2d of Augu&s;t, and left it the beginning of No|vember.</P>
<P>The Council and Attorney-general having fini&s;hed their pleadings, his Honor the Chief Ju&s;tice gave a charge to the Jury.</P>
<P>Murder, Gentlemen, is the highe&s;t and mo&s;t heinous crime again&s;t the law of nature, and it is greatly aggravated when the parent de|&s;troys its own offspring; but it is denied that the child was murdered by its mother, becau&s;e it was already dead: yet you find &s;o far as her efforts could effect its de&s;truction, &s;he exerted them unpitying, and void of maternal affection.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e, which has been ably di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, was heretofore de&s;cribed by the laws in this manner&mdash;That whenever a &s;ingle or unmarried woman was delivered of a child, and attempted to conceal it, the bare concealment was made conclu&s;ive evidence again&s;t the mother, that &s;he murdered it, unle&s;s &s;he could make it appear by one evidence at lea&s;t, that the child &s;o concealed was born dead: &s;o that when this probable proof was in evidence, it was incumbent on the pri&s;oner to prove po&s;i|tively that the child was born dead, or did not die through her means or procurement; otherwi&s;e &s;he was adjudged guilty, and &s;uffered the penalty affixed to murder. This act of James&mdash;was recognized by the A&s;&s;embly of the State; and had the pri&s;oner been tried under that, there could not be the lea&s;t doubt but your verdict would determine her guilty. But now, by a late act of A&s;&s;embly, pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t Septem|ber, a further kind of proof is required, and the bare concealment is not &s;ufficient, unle&s;s there is a probable pre&s;umption offered, that the child was born alive. You have heard this kind of proof already ex|plained&mdash;That there are two kinds of evidence. The fir&s;t is po&s;itive proof, where the witne&s;s can &s;wear to the commi&s;&s;ion of the fact: this &s;ometimes is attainable, yet but &s;eldom in ca&s;es like the pre&s;ent. The &s;econd divi&s;ion is circum&s;tantial proof&mdash;This you have heard divided into three kinds. Fir&s;t, Violent pre&s;umption, which is the &s;tronger kind, and &s;uch as amounts to nearly full conviction, or of which the mind can enntertain no doubt. As in a ca&s;e, where you &s;ee a man greatly confu&s;ed, endeavouring to make his e&s;cape out of a hou&s;e, with his naked &s;word bloody in his hand, and a body lying on the floor newly &s;lain&mdash;This I &s;ay amounts to a violent pre&s;umption that the man en|deavouring to e&s;cape, is the &s;layer. Second, There is probable pre|&s;umption, which is not &s;o conclu&s;ive, or &s;atisfactory as the former. And thirdly&punc; There is &s;light pre&s;umption, but which, in capital ca&s;es, is &s;eldom allowed, if by it&s;elf, any weight in criminating the pri&s;oner, or much regarded by the Court or Jury. Be&s;ide the ca&s;e I have men|tioned,
<PB N="13" REF="020275_0013_0FAE9C6D3042A8F8">
you have heard others adduced by the Council; but among the re&s;t there is this kind of evidence&mdash;the confe&s;&s;ion of the party upon being apprehended, and this, when other circum&s;tances are &s;trong in its &s;upport, amounts to as full a conviction; I &s;ay it is &s;o &s;trong that no doubt can be had of the criminality, or he&s;itation left upon the mind, than would had you heard a witne&s;s come forward, and have &s;worn that he &s;aw the perpetration. The evidence, I &s;ay, would be &s;trong and conclu&s;ive in the in&s;tance which was mentioned by the Council, where a man &s;hould be robbed of twenty guineas, and that exact &s;um be found upon a man with two pi&s;tols, the one loaded the other di&s;charged&mdash;This, I &s;ay, would leave no doubt on your minds with re&s;pect to the criminal. But this is not the circum&s;tantial proof required in this ca&s;e. The law would not require this kind, becau&s;e it is not to be had; for people determined upon the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime of infanticide, always are &s;ilent and alone for the purpo&s;e of con|cealment, as they would hardly be &s;o callous or fool-hardened, as to commit it in public&mdash;Therefore po&s;itive proof can rarely be come at in &s;uch ca&s;es. The concealment of the child, as I have already re|marked, was deemed &s;ufficient evidence of its being murdered, though the Courts and Juries in England and here, for this many years, have always required &s;ome circum&s;tantial evidence be&s;ide, or they acquitted the pri&s;oners; and this law has long been deemed to &s;avour of &s;everity. Therefore the Legi&s;lature have altered the law in this re&s;pect, &s;o as to make it corre&s;pond with the already e&s;tabli&s;hed practice of their Courts of Ju&s;tice, and have required the &s;econd degree of circum&s;tantial evi|dence to convict the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved by the Attorney-general, that her per&s;i&s;ting in the denial of her being with child, even when &s;he was in labour, and her having made not the lea&s;t provi&s;ion of cloaths for the infant, and as &s;he cho&s;e to be delivered alone, when &s;he might have had the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her mi&s;tre&s;s and other women who were by&mdash;The&s;e, with the further circum&s;tance of her cutting its throat, (and as you are informed by one of the witne&s;&s;es, from ear to ear) with her endeavour to conceal it, by placing it wrapped up under a large roll of linen in a trunk&mdash;I &s;ay, if when you take and weigh all the circum&s;tances together, you are of opinion, that it amounts to a probable pre&s;umption that the child was born alive, you can be at no lo&s;s to decide that &s;he was guilty in the manner and form in which &s;he &s;tands indicted; and as it is incumbent, as I ob&s;erved before, upon her to prove it was born dead, you will examine what te&s;timony relates to this particular. There is her own relation of the &s;tory; &s;he &s;everal times &s;aid it was born dead, but then added al&s;o that &s;he had overlaid it, and on the Inque&s;t's finding the throat cut, &s;he owned having done that, but it was to prevent its crying. Again, there is the depo&s;ition of the Doctors, who, as pro|fe&s;&s;ional men, and as gentlemen eminent in their profe&s;&s;ion, declare, that they are convinced the child was born dead from the circum&s;tances of its appearance, and from a con&s;ideration of the hurts which the mo|ther
<PB N="14" REF="020275_0014_0FAE9C6DFB0A3E18">
had received, the one about a month before, another three days before, and a &s;train the very morning of the day &s;he was delivered, as well as the circum&s;tance of her being delivered on her back. I &s;ay, if you are &s;atisfied that the child was killed by any of the&s;e accidents, then you mu&s;t acquit, as the cutting of the infant's throat, already dead, cannot be accounted murder in the mother. It is for you, gen|tlemen, to weigh and con&s;ider the matter of fact; but I would ob&s;erve to you, that when you are &s;worn to give a true verdict from the evi|dence which &s;hall be laid before you, you are not bound to give that verdict upon the opinion or judgment of any man however eminent.</P>
<P>The Jury, after an ab&s;ence of about three hours, returned, and brought in their verdict guilty.</P>
<P>On the morning of Saturday, when &s;he was brought up to receive &s;entence of death, a motion was made by Mr. Todd, and &s;upported by Mr. Sergeant, that the Court would be plea&s;ed to grant a new trial, as an affidavit was produced, in which Mr. Edward Pole, one of the Jurors, had &s;aid the day preceding the trial, that he did not &s;ee how any per&s;on could bring in a verdict otherwi&s;e than guilty, (or words of like import.) This it was contended, would have been good cau&s;e of challenge, had it been known at the time; and if cau&s;e of challenge then, it &s;hould be allowed of weight now. Some law-ca&s;es were ad|duced, wherein new trials had been granted for &s;imilar rea&s;ons. The Attorney-general contended it ought not to be allowed for three rea&s;ons: the fir&s;t was, that no new trial was ever permitted in capital ca&s;es like the pre&s;ent: 2d. That a per&s;on's giving his opinion, was not cau&s;e of challenge; &s;o that if not cau&s;e of challenge, no pretence could be &s;et up for a new trial: and 3d. If it had been cau&s;e of challenge <HI>then,</HI> it was <HI>now</HI> too late. This was replied to by Mr. Sergeant, and the point conceded, that tho' no new trial had yet been had in capital ca&s;es, yet the Court had <HI>power</HI> to grant one, if it &s;aw good cau&s;e. To the &s;econd point he replied, it was cau&s;e of challenge, and no doubt could be re|ceived into the brea&s;t of the Court and Jury, but what if it had been known in time, they would have challenged him; if not for cau&s;e, they would without cau&s;e, (as every per&s;on has a right to challenge twenty of the 48 Jurors peremptorily, and as many more as he can &s;how cau&s;e for.) Of the third point he ob&s;erved, that as the Court had the <HI>power</HI> to allow a new trial, it could not be too late.</P>
<P>The Court gave it as their opinion, that the expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by Mr. Edward Pole were not &s;ufficient cau&s;e for the court to grant a new trial, and the girl then received &s;entence of DEATH; but &s;ince has been re&s;pired by the Honorable Supreme Executive Council.</P>

<P>About the middle of November my hou&s;e was broke open, or ra|ther entered, by opening the padlock of the cellar-door with a fal&s;e key. The goods mentioned in the indictment were taken away; &s;ome of which were got again, as next morning I got a &s;earch-warrant; and on &s;earching a cellar in the neighbourhood, we found them. A man was in the cellar at the time, who &s;eemed anxious to get away; but whether it was the pri&s;oner or not, I cannot po&s;itively &s;ay. After we were &s;earching about &s;ometime, O'Neil came down, and as &s;oon as he &s;aw we had di&s;covered the goods, he ran away: I followed him with a great number of others; and when we returned, I found that this man had al&s;o gone off, but I cannot &s;wear to the per&s;on.</P>

<P>I went with Mr. Burns to Coleman's cellar, and there we found this man: I am &s;ure of the fellow, I know him well enough &s;ure&mdash;they call him Jem Long Splice, <HI>Elias</HI> Long Jem. When we came in, we looked about for the cloaths; up the chimney there was a hole, which came down again, and I went to examine it&mdash;But Mr. Burns thought it not worth while; he &s;aid it was not his fir&s;t lo&s;s, for he had been robbed twice before; but I did not care, I would do my duty: &s;o I hunted about, and I went toward a tub that was turned over, and this Jem&mdash;aye I know you well enough&mdash;this fellow&mdash;your Honor&mdash;was &s;tanding with his back again&s;t them. After finding them this &s;ame jockey wanted to be off&mdash;but I would not let him out of the cellar. <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;Did not this <HI>Elias,</HI> or Long Jem, go out of the cellar? Yes, your Honor, Yes&mdash;but that was afterwards, when we went to pur&s;ue O'Neil. <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;Did not you intend to &s;eize this man, before you di&s;covered any part of the property? Yes; for I knew he was a great rogue as any from Ireland. This O'Neil, when he came in, &s;hook hands with him, and run away as &s;oon as he di&s;covered we had found the goods. I &s;eized this one by the collar, and told him not to &s;tir; but he did not heed me, and &s;prung up the cellar-&s;teps, I believe he touched nothing, for he can run as fa&s;t as any man I ever &s;aw. <HI>Coun|cil.</HI>&mdash;

Did he &s;truggle with you when you &s;eized him? <HI>No</HI> I coaxed him, and told him not to go. <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;Did you find any part of the property upon this man? No: but he was &s;tanding &s;o, with his back|&s;ide to the tub, hiding it.

<P>He went with Mr. Burns to the cellar, and &s;aw two or three men there, and believed the pri&s;oner at the bar to be one of them. He did not hear him &s;ay any thing; when O'Neil run off, he followed him, and knew nothing more of this man.</P>

<P>La&s;t November as he came along Front-&s;treet, he heard a terrible crackling of fire, and ob&s;erved a light in Coleman's cellar-window: he looked down, and &s;aw Coleman and his wife, and &s;ome other man; they were counting wet cloaths&mdash;and the man a&s;ked Coleman's wife, where &s;he would put them? and &s;he &s;aid down the hole in the chimney, but they &s;hould drink fir&s;t; they had a bottle, he thought, of rum, out of which they took a dram a-piece; they then tied up the cloaths in a bundle, and &s;eeing one of them coming toward the door, I went away. <HI>Council.</HI>&mdash;Did you &s;ee the pri&s;oner in the cellar? No, Sir, but next day the goods were found.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner delared him&s;elf innocent, that he had only been a &s;hort time in this city, whence he came from Baltimore, and that it appeared to him as if Go&s;s would &s;wear any man's life away.</P>
<P>The Jury brought in their verdict not guilty.</P>
<P>After being advi&s;ed by his Honor the Chief Ju&s;tice, of the dangers to which men are expo&s;ed, who keep bad company, and cautioned to be more careful in future, in the choice of his a&s;&s;ociates, he was or|dered to be di&s;charged upon the payment of his fees.</P>
