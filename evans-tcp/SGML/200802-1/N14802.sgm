<P>TO employ the pitiful invention of tyrants to &s;upport the freedom of republics&mdash;&mdash;to introduce laws into the commonwealths of America, that have been long reprobated by wi&s;e and good men in the mo|narchies of Europe&mdash;to revive the exploded doctrine and practice of te&s;ts&mdash;marks &s;uch an extreme degree of folly, that one would imagine men of common under&s;tandings would endeavour to palliate the enormity of the act by the abolition of it, as &s;oon as the cau&s;e which gave ri&s;e to it had cea&s;ed to exi&s;t. Who, that had not con&s;ulted the &s;tatutes of Penn&s;yl|vania, would believe that in a country, that had been for upwards of a century the &s;eat of liberty, &s;cience and religion, a law &s;hould exi&s;t, that deprived nearly one half of its inha|bitants of the privileges of citizens; and this too in the &s;e|cond year after the peace, which confirmed the liberties and independence of America?</P>
<P>Before I proceed to make any remarks upon this law, I beg leave to in&s;ert the following copy of the te&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>Te&s;t required by Act of A&s;&s;embly, October <HI>1, 1778.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"I, <HI>A. B.</HI> do &s;olemnly and &s;incerely declare and &s;wear, or affirm, that the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania is, and of right ought to be, a free, &s;overeign and independent &s;tate.

<P>By the act of October 1, 1779, all male white inhabitants of the &s;tate, who had not taken the te&s;t required by the act of June 13, 1777, in due time, were required to take the
<PB N="4" REF="018770_0003_0FA81AF04A714378">
foregoing oath or affirmation within certain limited times, viz. in Cumberland, Bedford, Northumberland and We&s;tmore|land, on or before the fir&s;t day of December next en&s;uing; in Lanca&s;ter, York, Berks and Northampton, within thirty-five days after the pa&s;&s;ing of &s;aid act; and in the city of Phi|ladelphia, and in the counties of Philadelphia, Bucks and Che&s;ter, within twenty days after the pa&s;&s;ing thereof&mdash;other|wi&s;e to be incapable of electing or being elected into, or hold|ing any office or place of tru&s;t within the government, &s;erving on juries, or keeping &s;chools, except in private hou&s;es.&mdash; After the times above &s;pecified, they were for ever excluded from taking the oath or affirmation, and were deprived of the privileges and benefits of a citizen who complied with the &s;aid act.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t objection that I &s;hall make to this law is, that it is contrary to the principles of free government. Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in being governed by laws made by our&s;elves, or by rulers cho&s;en by our&s;elves. This is the true definition of liberty. The men who are disfranchi&s;ed by this law are, therefore, in a &s;tate of &s;lavery. Repre&s;entation and taxation &s;hould go hand in hand. If this is not true, the late glorious revolution was a rebellion.</P>
<P N="2">2d. This law (if, after what follows, it de&s;erves the name of a law) is contrary to the con&s;titution of the &s;tate. A con|&s;titution is the palladium of the liberty of a free country. It is the rule of legi&s;lators, as laws are the rule of the people whom they govern. Every part of a con&s;titution &s;hould be &s;acred, and hence the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania requires, that every member of the A&s;&s;embly, before he takes his &s;eat, &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe the following oath: <Q>I do &s;wear or affirm, that, as a member of this A&s;&s;embly, I will not propo&s;e or a&s;&s;ent to any bill, vote or re&s;olution, which &s;hall appear to me injurious to the people, nor do or con&s;ent to any act or thing whatever, that &s;hall have a tendency to le&s;&s;en or abridge their rights and privileges, as declared in the con&s;titution of this &s;tate; but will in all things conduct my&s;elf as a faithful, hone&s;t repre&s;entative and guardian of the people, according to the be&s;t of my judgment and abilities.</Q></P>
<P>But what &s;ays the te&s;t law? It is certainly an "abridge|ment" of the privileges of nearly one half the inhabitants of the &s;tate. It is contrary to the 7th and 8th articles of the bill of rights, and to the 6th and 17th &s;ections of the con|&s;titution, which declare <Q>That all elections ought to be free, and that all freemen having a <HI>&s;ufficient common intere&s;t,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="018770_0004_0FA81AF0CE556348">
and <HI>attachment</HI> to the &s;tate, have a right to elect officers, and to be elected into office. That every member of &s;o|ciety hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty and <HI>property,</HI> and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion towards the expence of that protection, and yield her per&s;onal &s;ervice when nece&s;&s;ary, or an <HI>equi|valent thereto</HI></Q> (which the non-jurors have done by their double taxes and militia fines) <Q>But <HI>no part</HI> of a man's <HI>property</HI> can be ju&s;tly taken from him, or applied to public u&s;es, without <HI>his own con&s;ent,</HI> or that of his <HI>legal</HI> repre&s;en|tatives.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Every freeman of the full age of twenty-one years, hav|ing re&s;ided in this &s;tate for the &s;pace of one whole year next before the day of election for repre&s;entatives, and paid public taxes during that time, &s;hall <HI>enjoy the right of an elector.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Repre&s;entation in proportion to the number of taxable inhabitants is the only principle which can at all times &s;e|cure liberty, and make the voice of a <HI>majority of the people</HI> the law of the land.</Q></P>
<P>But further&mdash;the con&s;titution &s;ays, <Q>In all pro&s;ecutions for criminal offences, a man hath a right to be heard by him&s;elf and his council, to demand the cau&s;e and nature of his accu&s;ation, to be confronted with the witne&s;&s;es, to call for evidence in his favor, and a &s;peedy public trial by an <HI>impartial jury of the country,</HI> without the unanimous con&s;ent of which jury he <HI>cannot be found guilty.</HI></Q>&mdash;Bill of rights, article 9th.</P>
<P>Now, if a man cannot be convicted of the mo&s;t trifling offence, except by a jury of twelve men, why &s;hould he be deprived of his liberty by an act of the legi&s;lature? This &s;ummary mode of inflicting puni&s;hments is contrary to all our ideas of a free government. I am per&s;uaded, that if nine out of ten of the non-jurors in Penn&s;ylvania were to be tried by a jury of twelve of tho&s;e men, who pa&s;&s;ed the law of October 1, 1778, or who approved of it in the Council of Cen&s;ors, or who now continue it in force, by refu&s;ing to re|vi&s;e it, that they would be pronounced not guilty, and re&s;tor|ed to the rights of citizen&s;hip. Hence ari&s;es the &s;afety and the ine&s;timable value of that mode of trial. I honor the Cen&s;ors for that con&s;truction of the con&s;titution, which ren|ders Judges and Magi&s;trates independent of the power of the A&s;&s;embly, and amenable only to a tribunal of twelve men.&mdash; But is the character of a Judge or a Magi&s;trate of more con&s;equence than the freedom of two-fifths of a &s;tate?&mdash;
<PB N="6" REF="018770_0005_0FA81AF1558BDA98">
Shall juries determine in the one ca&s;e, and the A&s;&s;embly in the other?&mdash;I cannot conceive of an idea more repugnant to the principles and honor of the late revolution, than an A&s;|&s;embly taking away the liberties of &s;everal thou&s;and citizens, without the formality of a fair and impartial trial. Had the&s;e men committed any crime? No. Had they created in&s;urrec|tions in any part of the &s;tate? No. Why then &s;hould we in|flict the heavie&s;t of all puni&s;hments upon them&mdash;not bani&s;h|ment&mdash;not death&mdash;but SLAVERY.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the natural prejudices which many people have again&s;t oaths of abjuration and allegiance in the time of war, there are two objections to the pre&s;ent te&s;t, which ef|fectually prevented its being taken by many people. It is an oath requiring <HI>activity</HI> in &s;upport of the independence of America. This could not be taken by tho&s;e &s;ects of chri&s;tians who hold war to be unlawful, at a time when <HI>arms</HI> were the only means of &s;upporting our independence. And 2dly. the oath had a retro&s;pect to pa&s;t actions. This was both impolitic and tyrannical. There was a progre&s;s in the minds of mo&s;t men upon the &s;ubject of the late controver&s;y. Some were rou&s;ed into re&s;i&s;tance by the apprehen&s;ions of di|&s;tant danger, while others did not decide in our favor, till they were undeceived by witne&s;&s;ing Briti&s;h perfidy and barbarity. Now this law cut off all &s;uch recruits to the American &s;tandard, many of whom, in our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates, have been the mo&s;t de|termined and active foes to Great-Britain. But again&mdash;the law impo&s;ed re&s;traints upon the con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who&s;e wi&s;hes were favorable to the cau&s;e of America from the be|ginning. Could the whig, whom fear, or the citizen, whom age, or &s;ickne&s;s, or poverty, detained in the route or &s;ociety of the enemy, and who was compelled by contributions of provi&s;ions, manufactures or quarters, indirectly "to aid, a&s;|&s;i&s;t and abet the king of Great-Britain, &amp;c." &s;ub&s;cribe this te&s;t? No; he could not. Why then &s;hould per&s;ons in this predicament be deprived of the privileges of citizens?</P>
<P>The limitation of the time given for taking this oath con|&s;titutes a material part of its folly and inju&s;tice. It was pa&s;&s;|ed in the middle year of the war, at a time when its duration and i&s;&s;ue were uncertain. It was a &s;troke that &s;evered one of the &s;inews of the &s;late. What &s;hould we think of part of a crew in a leaky &s;hip, in the middle of the Atlantic, who, out of re&s;entment to one half their &s;hip's company for re|fu&s;ing to take their turn at the pump for one night, &s;hould &s;wear, that at no time during the remaining part of the voyage they &s;hould take their turn at the pump, even though
<PB N="7" REF="018770_0006_0FA81AF2173DE3E0">
they repented of their negligence, and &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition afterwards to &s;hare in the toils or danger of the voyage? Certainly we &s;hould blame &s;uch conduct. But ju&s;t &s;o has the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania acted towards a great body of her citizens during the late war.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent te&s;t law was pa&s;&s;ed at a time when news|papers, the vehicles of our laws, had a partial circulation thro' the &s;tate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The law for the gradual Abolition of Slavery, pa&s;&s;ed March 1, 1780, allowed <HI>&s;ix</HI> months for all &s;uch per&s;ons as owned Slaves to re|gi&s;ter them, otherwi&s;e, after the expiration of that time, they were to be free. Notwith&s;tanding the intere&s;t all Slave-holders had in complying with this law, yet we find many hundreds of them lo&s;t their &s;laves from their ignorance of it. Some of the&s;e Slave-holders lived within 12 miles of the city of Philadelphia. The news papers at that time circulated only in the city.</NOTE> It was pa&s;&s;ed too at a time when there were but few Magi&s;trates, and tho&s;e &s;o remotely &s;ituated, that it was in &s;ome ca&s;es difficult, and in mo&s;t expen&s;ive, to gain acce&s;s to them. From the&s;e two cau&s;es, I am per&s;uaded, there are &s;everal thou&s;and non-jurors in Penn&s;ylvania, among whom are may valuable whigs. I could mention &s;ome of the&s;e, who are officers in the militia, and who have never declined duty or danger in the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The te&s;t law is highly <HI>impolitic.</HI> Monte&s;quieu (who&s;e writings are oracular in all free countries) &s;ays, that "men who enjoy more, or who po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s liberty than the re&s;t of a community, are always the enemies of the liberty of that community."</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive what mu&s;t be the &s;entiments of the non-jurors, by a&s;king our&s;elves what our feelings would be in their &s;ituation. If they are not the enemies of our go|vernment&mdash;if they do not with hold their contributions to the commerce and agriculture of the &s;tate&mdash;if they do not &s;icken at its pro&s;perity, and rejoice in its misfortunes&mdash;if they do not refu&s;e to pay taxes&mdash;in a word, if they do not hate their u&s;urpers and ma&s;ters&mdash;it is becau&s;e a great majority of them are under the influence of principles, which render them as much the objects of affection and admiration to wi&s;e and good men, as they are the &s;ubjects of hatred and oppre&s;&s;ion of our government.</P>
<P>It is incumbent upon a free people, to guard again&s;t the contagion of &s;lavery. Sights of di&s;tre&s;s, unrelieved, always harden the heart. Slaves living among freemen will gradu|ally le&s;&s;en the horrors of &s;lavery, and the charms of liberty.
<PB N="8" REF="018770_0007_0FA81AF2F8B833E0">
Be&s;ides, who knows how long the&s;e people may endure their &s;ituation with patience?</P>
<P>Lord Chatham repealed the American &s;tamp-act, by de|claring that "three millions of people, reduced to a &s;tate of &s;lavery in America, would be fit in&s;truments for en&s;laving the whole of the Briti&s;h empire." Two-fifths of the inhabitants of Penn&s;ylvania may &s;oon acquire &s;uch a majority, by the in|fluence of their arts or their wealth, as to en&s;lave the re&s;t of the &s;tate. It has been thought, that the pre&s;ent race of Bri|ti&s;h kings have been made more arbitrary, by transferring the habits of government acquired in Hanover to the Briti&s;h empire. The &s;ame men who rule &s;laves, &s;hould never make a law for freemen. The ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of the lives and properties of the non-jurors, are dangerous legi&s;lators in a free country.</P>
<P>Friends and Fellow-citizens, think what you are doing, when you in&s;truct your rulers to continue the pre&s;ent te&s;t-law. The power of the &s;tate will not divide, &s;o as to gratify you all. Mo&s;t of you will probably never ri&s;e beyond the &s;urface of private life. Why, then, &s;hould you ri&s;que your <HI>own</HI> liberty, without the lea&s;t chance of deriving any advan|tage from taking away the liberties of <HI>other</HI> people? Extend liberty to your neighbours, as you wi&s;h to pre&s;erve your own. Liberty differs from almo&s;t every thing el&s;e that is precious, in this, that the more your neighbours po&s;&s;e&s;s of it, the more you will enjoy your&s;elves.</P>
<P>From the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, which admits fo|reigners to a vote after one year's re&s;idence, the continu|ance of the te&s;t law is big with evils of a mo&s;t alarming na|ture. The government, in a few years, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall into other hands. Men with European ideas of govern|ment will &s;oon occupy the &s;eats of our pre&s;ent rulers. The Briti&s;h farmer, who paid his proportion of taxes to carry on the late war again&s;t us, and even the Briti&s;h officer, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in de&s;olating our country, will in a little while, by means of the votes of their countrymen, &s;upplant the Ame|rican patriot and &s;oldier, who purcha&s;ed our freedom with their fortunes or &s;cars.</P>
<P>Rome was undone by &s;trangers getting her government into their hands, and introducing foreign prejudices, cu&s;toms and vices among them. If our con&s;titution cannot be alter|ed, let us remedy that defect in it, by admitting the non-jurors to a &s;hare in the government, in order to balance the undue and dangerous weight of foreigners. The non-jurors are attached to our &s;oil by birth, education and property,
<PB N="9" REF="018770_0008_0FA81AF5B3EC6390">
and (if they can be permitted) are willing to add to the&s;e ties, the more &s;acred tie of an oath or affirmation of alle|giance. The&s;e men can have no intere&s;t unconnected with our own. Born under the protection of the &s;ame laws with our&s;elves, educated in the &s;ame &s;chools, and connected with us by the ancient ties of friend&s;hip and bu&s;ine&s;s, they are our natural friends and fellow-citizens. Our liberties, and the con&s;titution of the &s;tate, will therefore be &s;afe in their hands.</P>
<P>By the ninth &s;ection of the te&s;t law, a non-juror cannot &s;erve on juries. This is an evil likewi&s;e, which has produced great mi&s;chief and danger to the &s;tate. It throws an un|equal &s;hare of the burden of government upon the jurors. It delays, and thereby increa&s;es, the expences of Courts, both to individuals and the &s;tate. It moreover renders property le&s;s &s;ecure, and the deci&s;ions of jurors le&s;s &s;atisfactory, by obliging the Sheriffs, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to drag jurymen into courts, who are not qualified, by knowledge or proper|ty, to decide upon the liberties or property of their neigh|bours.</P>
<P>But there are other con&s;iderations which &s;hould have great weight with us, in per&s;uading us to revi&s;e our te&s;t-law. The Court of Britain is unfriendly to us. Her power and intere&s;t in foreign Courts are employed to traduce our cha|racter and forms of government. The Monarchs of Europe are collecting anecdotes of our country, by means of their emi&s;&s;aries, in order to check the emigrations of their &s;ubjects, by holding up the mi&s;eries and di&s;traction of our republics. Nor is this all. There is &s;uch a thing as emulation without jealou&s;y, and contention without &s;trife. Our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates have manife&s;ted both towards us ever &s;ince the declaration of independence. They are bending their whole force to rival and &s;upplant us in trade, &s;ea-ports, and inland navigation. Several of them have already become re&s;pectable from their <HI>union.</HI> They bring the minds of their citizens to a focus in all their laws. It is only by healing our divi&s;ions, that we &s;hall di&s;appoint our foreign enemies, and it is only by mak|ing every member of the &s;tate equally free and happy, that we &s;hall recover our ancient pre-eminence, as a &s;tate, in agri|culture, commerce, wealth and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Once more. The public debt contracted by the late war is &s;till unfunded. Whether it will be funded upon a conti|nental impo&s;t, or upon &s;tate taxes, is &s;till uncertain. But can it be expected that the non-jurors will pay their proportion of taxes, which amounts to two-thirds of the whole, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="10" REF="018770_0009_0FA81AF72F015728">
either way, while they are unrepre&s;ented in our legi&s;lature? It is true, there is a compelling power in government&mdash;But tax-gatherers them&s;elves have contracted &s;o much of the &s;pirit of the peace, that they revolt at the idea of &s;eizing pro|perty for taxes. Be&s;ides, every one knows how ea&s;y it is to delay for years the payment of taxes, without refu&s;ing them; and yet the&s;e delays materially affect the credit and intere&s;t of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Again. The exigencies of the &s;tate have been &s;aid to re|quire paper money. To introduce this money into general circulation, and to &s;upport its credit, the concurrence of every member of the &s;tate, who handles money, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Now, the non-jurors compo&s;e a large proportion of the merchants, millers and traders of the &s;tate, who, it is well known, are that body of people who give money its greate&s;t circulation. Can it be expected, that the&s;e men will receive this money? Can it be expected, that they will con|cur to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of men who en&s;lave them, or keep up the credit of a government, in which they have no inte|re&s;t? If they do&mdash;they mu&s;t be more, or le&s;s, than men.</P>
<P>The duties of the war have nearly worn out the jurors. It is high time to call upon every citizen of the &s;tate, who is qualified by education or virtue, to bear his part of the drud|gery of government. While the jurors are &s;erving their coun|try in the A&s;&s;embly, upon juries, and in all the offices con|nected with the collection of taxes, the &s;upport of the poor, and the care of the public roads, the non-jurors are engaged in the pur&s;uits of private intere&s;t, and ama&s;&s;ing wealth, the weight of which can never, in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, be thrown into the &s;cale of government. It becomes us to con&s;ider what the con&s;equences may be, of their throwing it into the &s;cale that is <HI>oppo&s;ed</HI> to our government.</P>
<P>Every body complains of the difficulty of borrowing mo|ney at the legal intere&s;t. The Bank has been accu&s;ed of be|ing the cau&s;e of this difficulty, but without foundation; for the difficulty was the &s;ame as it is at pre&s;ent before the in&s;titution of the Bank. The true cau&s;e of this difficulty is to be &s;ought for in the te&s;t-law. The principal part of the &s;pe|cie of the &s;tate is in the hands of non-jurors; for they po&s;|&s;e&s;s two thirds, or perhaps more, of the <HI>productive</HI> property of Penn&s;ylvania. Now, can it be expected that the&s;e men will lend money upon intere&s;t, when they have no &s;hare in our government, when they have no vote to protect them again&s;t the operation of a tender law, and no &s;ecurity again&s;t being precluded from recovering their debts by the ordinary cour&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="018770_0010_0FA81AF760D10FE0">
of ju&s;tice? I am not &s;urprized at &s;ome of the&s;e people hav|ing lately remitted their ca&s;h to Europe, and lodged it there, at an intere&s;t <HI>below</HI> the legal intere&s;t of our &s;tate.</P>
<P>Every view we can take of the te&s;t-law, &s;erves only to in|crea&s;e our apprehen&s;ions from it to the liberties and pro&s;pe|rity of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>I &s;hould like to believe that human nature was improving, from the lights which religion, &s;cience, and the principles of liberty, have diffu&s;ed over the world. But I am afraid that mankind, in different ages, only change their vices and fol|lies. In vain do we boa&s;t of the toleration of all religious &s;ects in our government, while we per&s;ecute for <HI>opinions</HI> in politics. The &s;ame &s;pirit which excludes the&s;e &s;ects from the privileges of citizens, would probably revive the days of Archbi&s;hop Laud among us, if religious tenets were equal ob&s;tacles to the power of the &s;tate, with the revi&s;ion of the te&s;t-law.</P>
<P>But I will go further.&mdash;The principal part of the non-jurors are Quakers, Menoni&s;ts, Swingfielders and Moravians, all of whom are <HI>principled</HI> again&s;t war. The te&s;t-law, in its pre&s;ent form, therefore, is an inva&s;ion of the rights of con|&s;cience, and a direct act of per&s;ecution for con&s;cience &s;ake. It is a violation of the &s;econd article of the Bill of Rights, which &s;ays&mdash;<Q>Nor can any man, who acknowledges the be|ing of a God, be ju&s;tly deprived of any <HI>civil right</HI> as a ci|tizen, on account of his religious &s;entiments, or peculiar mode of religious wor&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P>I know it has been &s;aid, that many of the&s;e people were tories during the war. If they were after the pa&s;&s;ing of the law, I &s;hould not have been &s;urprized at it. For as they &s;aw &s;lavery before them in the journals of Penn&s;ylvania, as well as in the records of the Briti&s;h Parliament, I do not wonder that they preferred foreign to dome&s;tic tyrants.</P>
<P>But I deny that this was the ca&s;e. I believe that a greater proportion of active whigs are to be found among them, than of tories. A great majority of them were neutrals, and &s;ome of the&s;e &s;o extremely ignorant of the nature of the controver&s;y, and of the events of the war, as to enquire, when they heard of the victories or defeats of our Gene|rals, to which &s;ide they belonged." Compare the con|duct of our non-jurors with the conduct of the tories in our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates. Have we ever heard of a &s;ingle in&s;urrection a|mong them? Did tho&s;e of them, who remained in Philadel|phia in the year 1777 and 8, addre&s;s the commanding offi|cers of the Briti&s;h army? What proportion of new levies
<PB N="12" REF="018770_0011_0FA81AF8AF5A5080">
did they draw from our populous &s;tate? While New-Jer&s;ey furni&s;hed them with &s;ix regiments, and North-Carolina lent them one third of their &s;tate, they were never able to mu&s;ter more than 120 recruits in Penn&s;ylvania. The &s;pirit of the non-jurors was ho&s;tile to nothing but war. They opened their hou&s;es alike to the officers of the Briti&s;h and American armies. Their agriculture fed our army, their taxes were at all times three-fourths of the whole contributions of Penn|&s;ylvania, and their arts furni&s;hed a large proportion of tho&s;e manufactures which cloathed our &s;oldiers. In a temple &s;o glorious as the fabric of liberty, erected by means of the late war, the mo&s;t trifling &s;ervice performed to the building &s;hould not be forgotten. If thanks are not due, certainly toleration is, to every man who ploughed a furrow, or &s;hod a hor&s;e, for the benefit of the American army.</P>
<P>How di&s;honorable to Penn&s;ylvania, after comparing the conduct of our non-jurors with the conduct of the tories in our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates, that Penn&s;ylvania is the only &s;tate in the uni|on that has not revi&s;ed or repealed her te&s;t-laws! Even in North and South-Carolina, where many of the tories car|ried arms, the whigs have &s;hewed the magnanimity of con|que&s;t, as well as the &s;pirit of liberty and wi&s;e government, by admitting every man to equal privileges in their &s;tates.</P>
<P>The Quakers were the original inhabitants of Penn&s;ylva|nia. They encountered all the hard&s;hips of &s;ettling on bare creation. They di&s;covered a new art of &s;ubduing &s;avages, by the integrity of their intercour&s;e with them. To their wi&s;dom, indu&s;try and benevolence, Penn&s;ylvania, for half a century, owed all her fame and happine&s;s. Look at the char|ter compo&s;ed by the founder of the province, and examine the laws that were pa&s;&s;ed by the Quakers, while they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed all the power of Penn&s;ylvania. In neither of them is a &s;ingle article or &s;ection to be found, which abridges any man of the rights of con&s;cience. The power and offices of the province were open alike to men of every nation and &s;ect, with them&s;elves. When Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay refu&s;ed to per|mit a crew of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Iri&s;h emigrants even to land up|on her &s;hores, Penn&s;ylvania opened her arms to receive them. When a body of Germans met with unexpected di&s;|appointments, after landing in New-York, the Quakers gave them protection, and thus afforded encouragement for thou|&s;ands of their countrymen to follow them to this land of li|berty. Humanity would drop a tear, if the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors or de|&s;cendants of the&s;e men &s;hould be found to be among the mo&s;t violent in oppo&s;ing the revi&s;ion of the te&s;t-law, and thereby
<PB N="13" REF="018770_0012_0FA81AF8E1BA2BA8">
of re&s;toring the Quakers to the dignity and happine&s;s of free|men&mdash;But further,&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould di&s;cover a great pro|portion of tho&s;e people, who are oppo&s;ed to the revi&s;ion of the te&s;t-law, to have alternately &s;worn allegiance to King George, and the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, according as the arms of the one or the other prevailed during the late war. I am able to produce a li&s;t of the names of the&s;e people, and of the days on which they were transferred, backwards and for|wards, to their different ma&s;ters. Do you think, my friends, to cancel your guilt in the&s;e tran&s;actions, by per&s;ecuting the non-jurors? They certainly acted an hone&s;t part, compared with the part you have acted. They deceived neither party. America never counted them among the number of the mili|tia, nor did General Howe ever tran&s;mit their names to the Secretary of State, as converts from rebellion to royalty.</P>
<P>I cannot help introducing a remark upon the te&s;t-law of Penn&s;ylvania, in which it differs from the te&s;t-laws of Great-Britain and Ireland. By the former, the door of office and power &s;tands con&s;tantly open to the di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Church. By the latter, all the privileges of freemen are offered to the Catholics, upon their abjuring the doctrines of the Church of Rome. All the powers and arts of govern|ment have been employed to force the&s;e te&s;ts upon the con|&s;cience. Here there was a mixture of mi&s;taken benevolence with tyranny. But the te&s;t-law of Penn&s;ylvania holds out nothing but unmixed tyranny and per&s;ecution. It bars the door for ever again&s;t repentance and conver&s;ion. It proclaims perpetual war again&s;t uniformity in government, and thus renders the &s;tandard of di&s;cord the true arms of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>There is another compari&s;on of the te&s;t-law, which places it, if po&s;&s;ible, in a more odious light. It is with the law for aboli&s;hing &s;lavery, pa&s;&s;ed March 1, 1780.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit and letter of the con&s;titution are pre&s;erved by this law. It does not admit free Negroes, it is true, to the privilege of voting, but then it exempts them from taxes A free Negroe is in a &s;afer and more honorable &s;ituation in Penn&s;ylvania, than a Quaker who has not &s;ubmitted to the te&s;t-law. This fact &s;hould excite the more di&s;tre&s;s and &s;hame, when we recollect, that it was the example and publications of the people called Quakers, that di&s;&s;eminated tho&s;e prin|ciples of equal liberty and humanity thro' the &s;tate, which at la&s;t produced that excellent law for the gradual abolition of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>I know it has been urged, that if the non-jurors are re|&s;tored to their rights, they will combine, and re&s;tore the
<PB N="14" REF="018770_0013_0FA81AF996DBE208">
&s;tate back to Great-Britain. The men who urge this objec|tion to the revi&s;ion of the te&s;t-law certainly do not believe it. The pa&s;&s;ive principles of the non-jurors forbid it.&mdash;Can it be po&s;&s;ible, that &s;ocieties, whom neither the threats nor per|&s;wa&s;ions of the principal officers of the Briti&s;h army in the year 1777, after they had conquered the city of Philadelphia, could prevail upon to contribute a &s;ingle act of friend&s;hip to them, or of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Americans, can be prevail|ed upon to di&s;turb the peace of a &s;ettled government, in order to bring about a re-union with Great-Britain? Com|mon &s;en&s;e revolts at the idea.</P>
<P>Equally ab&s;urd and groundle&s;s is the fear, that the non-jurors will repeal the law for puting an end to proprietary influence in Penn&s;ylvania. Who began and continued the controver&s;ies with the late Proprietaries about quitrents?&mdash; The Quakers. Who oppo&s;ed them in all tho&s;e incroach|ments and exactions, which have lately been pointed out in one of the reports of the Council of Cen&s;ors?&mdash;The Qua|kers. Who attempted to re&s;cue the &s;tate from the dominion of the proprietary family in the year 1764, and to place it under the protection of the Crown?&mdash;The Quakers. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that the&s;e people can &s;o far forget their antient pre|judices and principles, as to revive a power which they &s;o long reprobated, checked and oppo&s;ed? I would as &s;oon be|lieve that Hannibal lived and died in friend&s;hip with the Romans.</P>
<P>I was &s;orry to hear an argument again&s;t the revi&s;ion of the te&s;t-law made u&s;e of in the A&s;&s;embly, in September la&s;t, which was exploded in our controver&s;y with Great-Britain. We were told, "that the non-jurors were <HI>virtually</HI> repre|&s;ented." This mode of repre&s;entation was proved, in the years 1773 and 1774, to be virtual non&s;en&s;e. What is there to prevent a non-juror from being doubly taxed?&mdash;Nothing. Who can plead his cau&s;e in the A&s;&s;embly?&mdash;No one. He holds his property&mdash;nay more, the <HI>remains</HI> of his liberty, and even his life, at the <HI>mercy</HI> of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>But, as an apology for the continuance of the te&s;t-law, we are told, that the non-jurors do not wi&s;h to have it revi&s;ed or repealed. If this be true, the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania is in the la&s;t &s;tage of political indi&s;po&s;ition. A phy&s;ician always puts on a &s;erious countenance, when a di&s;ea&s;ed limb lo&s;es its power of feeling. The whole body, when this is the ca&s;e, is in danger. If two-fifths of the &s;tate are reconciled to &s;la|very, the remaining three-fifths hold their liberty by a preca|rious tenure. But I deny that the non-jurors are &s;atisfied
<PB N="15" REF="018770_0014_0FA81AFA54713EF0">
with their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. They complain loudly &s;ince the peace, and expre&s;s the utmo&s;t anxiety to enjoy the pri|vileges of freemen. Their patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the te&s;t-law during the war, aro&s;e from their di&s;inclination to &s;hare in government, while it was compelled to employ its forces in a bu&s;ine&s;s that was foreign to their principles.</P>
<P>There is one more motive, I cannot call it an argument, in favor of the continuance of the pre&s;ent te&s;t-law. It has been &s;aid that the jurors, by defending the &s;tate with arms, have acquired an exclu&s;ive right to the power of it. In an|&s;wer to this, I might only &s;ay, that dominion founded in arms, or rather in <HI>oaths,</HI> (for the mo&s;t violent of the jurors never bore arms, except on mu&s;ter-days) is as ab&s;urd as do|minion founded in grace. But I beg leave to a&s;k the people who urge this motive for continuing the te&s;t-law, whether any one of them ever performed a tour of duty, or rendered any e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the &s;tate, without being <HI>paid</HI> for it?&mdash; and whether the money which paid them did not come chief|ly from the pockets of the non-jurors?&mdash;Yes. A&s;k the tax-gatherers, and they will tell you that <HI>two-thirds</HI> of all the effective taxes that have been collected &s;ince the year 1779 have come from the non-jurors.&mdash;They will tell you further, that they have been collected with the lea&s;t murmuring and the mo&s;t punctuality from the&s;e people. Now, if money con|&s;titutes the &s;inews of war, then the non-jurors have &s;u&s;tained a material part of the weight of the late revolution in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania. To their indu&s;try and arts, the &s;tate owed a great part of the &s;upplies which &s;upported the continental army for &s;everal years; and to their taxes, chiefly, &s;he owes the pre-eminence which &s;he enjoys over her &s;i&s;ter &s;tates in the Continental Trea&s;ury. But again,&mdash;if this motive is admit|ted, and the power of the &s;tate is to be founded in whiggi&s;m, or arms, then a preference &s;hould certainly be given to tho&s;e men, who have done and &s;uffered mo&s;t for the &s;tate. The&s;e men, every one mu&s;t acknowledge, are the officers and &s;ol|diers of the Penn&s;ylvania line. No cla&s;s of citizens, I am &s;ure, will reprobate this idea more &s;incerely than tho&s;e officers and &s;oldiers them&s;elves. To their immortal honor let it be recorded, that they are almo&s;t to a man &s;trenuous advocates for equal liberty to every member of the &s;tate. They have long ago forgiven and forgotten the in&s;ults of the di&s;affected, and the neutrality of the non-jurors. This conduct will con|vey their names with infinitely more honor to po&s;terity, than all the in&s;ignia of the order of Cincinnatus.</P>

Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a recovered the throne of Sweden with a handful of men, recruited in a &s;ingle day in the province of Dalcarlia. Not more than one fourth part of the inhabitants of England took part in the civil war between King Charles and his parliament. Even King William was brought to En|gland by a &s;mall body of men, and afterwards placed upon the throne by a majority of only four votes.

<P>In our ideas of tyranny, we are too apt to &s;uppo&s;e that it can be derived only from monarchy or ari&s;tocracy. But hi&s;to|ry &s;hews us, that parties often en&s;lave each other. There can be no &s;afety in a &s;tate to any man, where there is a body of tyrants, and a body of &s;laves. Political liberty is the re&s;ult of the combined wills of every member of a community.

<P>An indu&s;trious man, with frugality, who pays his taxes punctually, is at all times a valuable member of a republic.</P>
<P>A man who manufactures and &s;ells more than he con|&s;umes, adds to the wealth and pro&s;perity of his country.</P>
<P>A man with good morals, who peaceably &s;ubmits to &s;uch laws of his country as are not again&s;t the dictates of his con&s;cience, let his political and religious principles be ever &s;o erroneous, is a better citizen than a man of di&s;&s;olute morals, with the pure&s;t principles in religion, and the free&s;t in government.</P>
<P>The non-jurors in Penn&s;ylvania are in general an in|du&s;trious, frugal, temperate body of people. Whatever their political principles may be, they are for the mo&s;t part genuine republicans in dre&s;s and manners. If they have erred&mdash;nay more, if they have &s;inned during the late war, we &s;hall con&s;ult the freedom and pro&s;perity of the &s;tate by forgiving them.

TAXES, and a peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all &s;uch laws as are not contrary to the dictates of con&s;cience, &s;hould always be con&s;idered as the morality of citizen&s;hip. To connect the right of &s;uffrage with a certificate of an oath, or the records of a Magi&s;trate's office, without appealing to the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors books, is as ab&s;urd, as it would be for a man to plead his title to the kingdom of Heaven, by producing at the Supreme Tribunal nothing but a regi&s;ter of his bapti&s;m.</P>

earth?

The &s;eeds of the reformation were &s;owed in England by Wickliffe, in the year 1362, nearly two hundred years before they &s;pread them&s;elves through every part of the nation. But we have an exam|ple of the progre&s;&s;ive operation of ju&s;t principles within the compa&s;s of our own knowledge, that applies directly to the ca&s;e in que&s;tion.

The&s;e principles &s;pread gradually, and in the cour&s;e of a few years were adopted as part of the &s;y&s;tem of doctrines of the people called Quakers.

Penn&s;ylvania has done homage to them in her &s;overeign and legi&s;lative capacity. The &s;laves of the &s;outhern &s;tates feel a plea&s;ure, when the name of Penn|&s;ylvania &s;ounds in their ears; and even the native African has learned to except our &s;tate, from the execrations he pronounces again&s;t Chri&s;tian tyrants and man-thieves. The&s;e principles of <HI>equal</HI> liberty have not &s;topped in Penn|&s;ylvania. They are travelling along the Che&s;apeake, and have found advocates on the banks of A&s;hley and Cooper rivers, in South-Carolina. In a few years they will pro|bably have their full operation upon the minds of our &s;outhern brethren, and produce laws for the abolition of &s;lavery &s;imilar to our own. Now, may not the pacific principles of the Quakers be propagated in the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, as their principles with re&s;pect to the &s;lavery of the Negroes? In order to favor the propagation and operation of the&s;e pacific prin|ciples, it certainly becomes us to admit the&s;e people, in the time of peace, to a &s;hare in our government. War is the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;avages. It begets vice and debt in all

civilized nations. It is agreeable to monarchs, becau&s;e they derive their glory and an encrea&s;e of power from it. But PEACE is the bu&s;ine&s;s and intere&s;t of republics. It favors liberty, promotes indu&s;try, and is the parent of all political happine&s;s. I do not wi&s;h to con&s;ider the Atlan|tic Ocean as the barrier of our benevolence, when we wi&s;h for perpetual peace, but I maintain that the love and &s;pirit of peace are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of the United States. Tho&s;e men will make the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lators for America, who oppo&s;e mi|&s;takes by negociation, and decide di&s;putes by arbitration. In the pre&s;ent feeble &s;tate of the confederation, I conceive there is nothing left to us, to render the union of the &s;tates perpetual, but to call into our aid, in every way that we can, the pacific principles of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion.</P>
<P>Freemen of Penn&s;ylvania, con&s;ider what you are do|ing. The nations of Europe are watching to &s;ee, whe|ther, by adopting republican forms of government, we have added to, or dimini&s;hed, the happine&s;s of man|kind. The next &s;even years, more than the la&s;t &s;even years, will determine their conduct, whether it will be be&s;t to a&s;&s;ert their freedom, or to prefer a le&s;s evil to a greater, by &s;ubmitting to the tyranny of monarchical government. The fate and liberty of the world, per|haps, are now &s;u&s;pended by our example. If we trample on the fir&s;t principles of ju&s;t government&mdash;if we violate the mo&s;t &s;acred parts of our con&s;titutions&mdash;if we enforce laws that are impolitic and inhuman&mdash;we &s;trengthen the chains of &s;lavery in Europe&mdash;we defeat the &s;chemes of tho&s;e benefactors of mankind, who are now &s;triving, by their writings, to &s;hake the thrones of tyranny, and thus check the la&s;t efforts of mankind, to re&s;tore human na|ture to her natural and original dignity.</P>
<P>I beg pardon, if, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e con&s;iderations, I have &s;aid any thing, that has offended tho&s;e members of the legi&s;lature who enacted the pre&s;ent te&s;t-law, or who, by refu&s;ing to revi&s;e it in the two la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions of the
<PB N="22" REF="018770_0021_0FA81B02642937A8">
A&s;&s;embly, have continued it in force. The law was pa&s;&s;ed at a time when clouds and darkne&s;s covered the &s;tate. The la&s;t year was devoted by the con&s;titution to enquiries, that were calculated to awaken jealou&s;ies, and inflame the pa&s;&s;ions. It is now &s;un&s;hine, and the pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;tate are again hu&s;hed into repo&s;e. Let an act of amne&s;ty then be pa&s;&s;ed in our minds, of all the errors that have been committed in government by parties and individuals. Let reconciliation, more refre&s;hing than the dew of Her|mon, de&s;cend upon our mountains, and let brotherly love, more fragrant than the ointment that was poured upon Aaron's head, flow down upon the &s;kirts of the &s;tate, and let us all once more embrace each other as friends and members of the &s;ame political family.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with the following ob&s;ervation:</P>
<P>If neither a regard to the principles of free government, nor to our con&s;titution&mdash;if neither policy nor humanity&mdash; if neither intere&s;t, nor a regard to the honor or &s;afety of the &s;tate&mdash;if the terrors of divine judgments recorded in the old, and the precepts of benevolence and mercy de|livered in the new te&s;tament&mdash;have no effect upon us in producing a revi&s;ion of the te&s;t law&mdash;if a monopoly of the power of the &s;tate is a more de&s;irable object with any body or &s;ect of our citizens, than the pre&s;ervation of its liberties&mdash;I beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t to the&s;e people, that their &s;chemes of ambition will certainly be di&s;appointed; for the te&s;t law mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in a few years lo&s;e its ef|fect. The &s;ons of non-jurors, with the addition of the &s;ons of the moderate part of the jurors, increa&s;e in the ratio of three to one above the &s;ons of the pre&s;ent ruling party. The&s;e will, in a few years, produce a new chan|nel for the power of the &s;tate. But if human nature is the &s;ame in Penn&s;ylvania, as it is in the other &s;tates, the te&s;t-law will probably repeal it&s;elf in a much &s;horter time. However &s;teady the lu&s;t for power or offices may be in the leaders of a party, the party them&s;elves will not long be actuated by that principle. Parties, like individuals, when left to them&s;elves, &s;often, after the gratification of re|&s;entment,
<PB N="23" REF="018770_0022_0FA81B03DD4D8A88">
into moderation and gentlene&s;s. The inter|cour&s;e and good offices produced among our citizens by means of commerce will naturally &s;pread more and more every day, and thus revive ancient friend&s;hips and con|nections among us. The &s;ame men, who la&s;t year voted for A&s;&s;emblymen to oppo&s;e the revi&s;ion of the te&s;t-law, may probably reject them for continuing that law at the en&s;uing election.</P>
<P>I do not wi&s;h to &s;ee &s;uch frequent changes of our rulers, much le&s;s do I wi&s;h to &s;ee tho&s;e irremediable evils and ir|reconcilable animo&s;ities take place in Penn&s;ylvania, which mu&s;t &s;ucceed the di&s;&s;olution of the law in the manner that has been mentioned. I can &s;carcely conceive of a more agreeable &s;ight, than an A&s;&s;embly preferring what is <HI>ju&s;t</HI> to what is <HI>popular</HI>&mdash;re&s;toring the con&s;titution of the &s;tate to its original and true meaning in all its parts&mdash;burying in oblivion every cau&s;e of &s;trife&mdash;combining the &s;trength and affections of the &s;tate into a focus&mdash;and, la&s;tly, con|&s;enting to divide the power and offices of the &s;tate equal|ly among all &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>Should the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly yield to the voice of na|ture, rea&s;on and religion, and open the doors of freedom in Penn&s;ylvania to all her children, by revi&s;ing the te&s;t-law, they will acquire a pre-eminence for wi&s;dom over all their predece&s;&s;ors, and render their fame as exten&s;ive, and their names as immortal, as it is now in their power to render the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
