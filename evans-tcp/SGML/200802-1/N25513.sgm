<HEAD>THE INFLUENCE OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT ON <HI>RELIGION.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM XI.3.</BIBL>
<Q>If the foundations by de&s;troyed, what &s;hall the righteous do?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>KING DAVID was rai&s;ed up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the &s;weet p&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael. In various ways did he give evidence that he was a man of virtue and religion. His attachment to the commonwealth of I&s;rael, and engagedne&s;s to &s;upport the laws and dignity of his country, were con&s;picuous orna|ments in his character. Amid&s;t the ba&s;e inventions of de&s;igning men, to enervate the bands of government, a&s;&s;ume the reigns, and di&s;&s;eminate di&s;cord among the people, animated with a holy regard to the rights of God and men, rendered him invincible to every rival. He could hear his competitors &s;ay as in ver&s;e fir&s;t, <HI>Flee as a bird to your mountain</HI>; and behold the <HI>wicked bend their bow, and make ready their arrow upon the &s;tring,</HI> without abandoning his country's cau&s;e, or wantonly trifling with the liberties of men. <HI>If the foundations be de&s;troyed, what &s;hall the righteous do</HI>? is a reflection worthy the king of I&s;rael in a time of public calamity. By <HI>foundations,</HI> is generally thought to mean the civil laws or government of I&s;rael, the&s;e were invaded, and threatened to be de&s;troy|ed by proud and factious men, which David in the text con&s;idered as a violent attack upon religion and the good
<PB N="4" REF="033864_0004_0FF8DB493B9A3590">
man's cau&s;e. If the laws and authority of the land are trampled upon, what &s;hall the righteous do? Intimating that their religious intere&s;t would greatly &s;uffer thereby.</P>
<Q><L>"If government be once de&s;troy'd,</L>
<L>(That firm foundation of our peace)</L>
<L>And violence makes ju&s;tice void,</L>
<L>Where &s;hall the righteous &s;eek redre&s;s?"</L></Q>
<P>THE influence of civil governnent upon religion and morality, and their connection, is a matter to which our candid attentions is called on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. That God is able to &s;upport his cau&s;e in the world without the intervention of legi&s;lative authority, and that they have no connexion, is a &s;entiment warmly advocated by many; and indeed none can di&s;pute them, without calling in que&s;tion the power of Omnipotence; but whether it be agreeable to the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution of heaven, in ordinary ca&s;es, to &s;upport religion without civil authority, or whether it be not favorable to virtue, is the inquiry. That God is able to appoint &s;tate officers without people's meeting to give their &s;uffrages, is what God has done and has natural power to do; but none will infer from thence, that &s;uch appointment actually will take place without public exertions.</P>
<P N="1">1. CIVIL government was <HI>appointed</HI> by God to regulate the affairs of men. I&s;rael of old received laws, both of a civil and religious nature, from the great Legi&s;lator of the univer&s;e. This is evident to all who are acquainted with &s;acred or prophane hi&s;tory. <HI>He removeth kings, and Jetteth up kings,</HI> Dan. ii.21. <HI>Thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e &s;et him king over thee whom the Lord thy God &s;hall choo&s;e,</HI> Deut. xvii.15. St. Paul, to enforce obedience to magis|tracy, points to the origin of civil power, Rom, xiii. The powers that be are <HI>ordained of God.</HI> Who&s;oever, there|fore, re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the <HI>ordinance of God.</HI>&mdash;For he is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good. Every ap|pointment of the Deity is favorable to religion, and condu|cive
<PB N="5" REF="033864_0005_0FF976806F2601E0">
thereto, as there is no other object worthy divine at|tention; to &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e would be an impious re|flection on the character of God.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the obvious end for which civil government was in&s;tituted, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that it is de|&s;igned as a &s;upport to virtue. To &s;uppre&s;s vice and im|morality&mdash;to defend men's lives, religion and properties, are the e&s;&s;ential con&s;tituents of a good government.</P>
<P>THE wickedne&s;s of the human heart is &s;o great, that it needs every re&s;traint. To oppo&s;e the impetuous torrent of iniquity; to humanize the &s;oul, and to conduct men in the way of felicity, are objects to which the laws of God and tho&s;e which are commonly called the laws of men, do mutually point. Without our lives and intere&s;ts are defended, how can we practi&s;e piety? Human laws, as well as divine, do in a &s;en&s;e re&s;pect the heart. The crim|inal is puni&s;hed for his enormities, by the hand of the civil magi&s;trate, becau&s;e they are con&s;idered as flowing from a bad heart. To &s;ay that an in&s;titution tends to maintain order, ju&s;tice, and the rights of men, or that it is favorable to religion, are expre&s;&s;ions &s;ynonimous. Al|though the government of a commonwealth has a partic|ular and a more immediate re&s;pect to the temporal intere&s;ts of men, yet there is a higher object to which they &s;tand related. and that renders them important.</P>
<P N="3">3. FURTHER light will be ca&s;t on the &s;ubject by at|tending to the qualifications and work of the civil mag|i&s;trate, as given in the word of God, from whence we de|rive the in&s;titution. The character required in any pro|f;e&s;&s;ion, will at once determine the end and de&s;ign of it. The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, the Rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me, He that ruleth over men <HI>mu&s;t be ju&s;t,</HI> ruling in the <HI>fear of God,</HI> II Sam. xxiii.3. The character of a &s;tate&s;man is drawn by the pen of unerring wi&s;dom, Deut. xvii. And it &s;hall be when he &s;itteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he &s;hall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before; the prie&s;ts the Levites. And it &s;hall be with him, and he &s;hall read therein all the days of
<PB N="6" REF="033864_0006_0FF8DBAE03299200">
his life: that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law, and the&s;e &s;tatutes, to do them: that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not a&s;ide from the commandment, to the right hand or to the left. "The Hebrews have recorded thus, When the king fitteth upon the throne of his king|dom, he is to write him the book of the law for him&s;elf, be&s;ide the one which is left him by his father, <ABBR>&amp;c.</ABBR> If his father has left him none, or if that be lo&s;t, he is to write him two books of the law, the one he is to re&s;erve in his hou&s;e, for &s;o he is commanded. The other is not to de|part from before him. If he go out to war, it goeth with him; if he &s;it in judgment, it is to be with him, <ABBR>&amp;c.</ABBR> Maimony treat of Kings." See Ain&s;worth's annotation. This book contained what is commonly called the law of Mo&s;es, giving directions about civil and religious affairs: This &s;hews that the lawyer &s;hould concern him&s;elf with the &s;acred oracles and that his profe&s;&s;ion is favorable to religion. St. Paul further informs us, That rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame. For he is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the &s;word in vain: for he is the mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath, upon him that doeth evil, Rom. xiii&mdash;The de&s;ign of civil government is in the be&s;t manner an&s;wered when kings are nur&s;ing fathers, and queens nur&s;ing mothers to the church of God, I&s;aiah, xlix.23.</P>
<P N="4">4. WERE we to compare tho&s;e countries and places where whole&s;ome laws exi&s;t, and are executed, with tho&s;e that are without them, we &s;hall find the contra&s;t &s;triking.&mdash;Where there are no laws, no &s;ubordination, there li|centiou&s;ne&s;s and barbarity hold their empire, and like a malignant fever diffu&s;e their baneful influence without re|&s;traint. Every one that is acquainted with &s;acred or other hi&s;tories, knows the propriety of the remark. Were we to
<PB N="7" REF="033864_0007_0FF97684907A3F18">
advert to our own experience, we have the cleare&s;t con|viction. Is it not the ca&s;e in general, that a contempt of the good laws of the land, and impiety are in&s;eparable companions?</P>
<P>WE have recent demon&s;tration, that civil authority is in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, the ba&s;is of religion, and have too much rea&s;on to adopt the language in the text, <HI>If the foundations be de&s;troyed, what &s;hall the righteous do!</HI> It is far from my intention to appear in the habit of a partizan, or to &s;tim|ulate di&s;&s;en&s;ion on an occa&s;ion like this, while I point you to the unprecedented conduct of a foreign power, as wit|ness to the truth of the topic under con&s;ideration. To exaggerate matters I have no inclination, nor to wound the tender feelings of humanity by a tedious detail of French enormities. To pur&s;ue their lawle&s;s ravages would be to trace the cruel exploits of a blood thir&s;ty Hannibal, or mercile&s;s &s;trides of an imperious Alexander. Near twenty villages in Germany have become a &s;acrifice to the vengeance of a more than &s;avage army. Switzerland, Geneva, (the latter, a place remarkable for their religion and good order) have fallen victims to their cruelties. The &s;oothing words, <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>equality,</HI> were &s;o dear to us, that we were hoping that true republicanism was their object, and were almo&s;t decoyed into their wretched em|braces; but they leave not the lea&s;t traces of it behind them. It it evidently their de&s;ign, to exterminate order and religion out of the univer&s;e, banquet on &s;tolen, prop|erty, give rules to the world, and &s;o become the tyrants of the earth.</P>
<P>"ECCLESIASTICS, of every de&s;cription, and particularly the profe&s;&s;ors of both &s;exes, &s;ays a late German writer) &s;eem to be the chief objects of republican malevolence, immorality and cruelty; in which the &s;oldiers were led on and encouraged by their officers." That an abolition of religion is an object of French in&s;anity is too evident to be di&s;puted; hence it is that they are &s;o inimical to civil authority, as they view it favorable to morality. We
<PB N="8" REF="033864_0008_0FF8DB4DAE2E3C30">
cannot mi&s;take them, when we con&s;ider their contempt of the Holy Scriptures, their athei&s;tical deci&s;ions, and their more than bea&s;tly conduct. Libertini&s;m, and its repub|licanism, is mo&s;t certainly their object. It is an inquiry worthy of attention, wheather the few years revolution in France has not done more towards promoting infidelity, dei&s;m and all manner of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, than half a cen|tury before. The near connection of religion with whole|some laws, or civil authority, is doubtle&s;s an often&s;ible rea&s;on why the latter is &s;o much the object of re&s;entment. The contempt that the&s;e &s;tates have met with from the French Diretory, in their not receiving our Envoys: their in&s;olent and enormous demands on our property&mdash;their blind and deceitful intrigues&mdash;their lawle&s;s depreda|tions on our commerce at &s;ea, are &s;ufficient to &s;hew that it is not peace, liberty and good order they are after, but to make them&s;elves &s;ole arbiters of tie world. Many have been care&s;&s;ed with the fa&s;cinating yell, <HI>Long live the republican!</HI>&mdash; and opened their gates to the French army, but have too late found their tender mercies to be cruelty, and them&s;elves in the hands of a plundering banditti. What outrages have been committed on the per&s;ons of old and young! Wives and daughters abu&s;ed in the pre|&s;ence of their hu&s;bands and parents.&mdash;Tho&s;e in &s;acred orders, notwith&s;tanding their age, illne&s;s and profe&s;&s;ion, dragged from their beds, their hou&s;es pillaged, and they have been the chief objects of &s;pight and dete&s;tation. Let many villages of Swabia, in Germany, witne&s;s to the truth of this ob&s;ervation. Such are the sad effects of no law, no order, no religion and if the foundations be de|stoyed, what &s;hall the righteous do?</P>
<P>THE candor and patience of this audience are reque&s;ted, while a few reflections are deduced from the preceding ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is undoubtedly our duty to become acquainted with the laws of the land. That by which the commonwealth of I&s;rael was governed, was to be well &s;tudied by their &s;tate&s;|men,
<PB N="9" REF="033864_0009_0FF9768612FC61D0">
Deut.xvii. E&s;pecially tho&s;e who are to be repre|&s;entatives of the people, &s;hould well under&s;tand the laws of their country: tho&s;e then of the profe&s;&s;ion are not di&s;qualified to fit in the fear of government, by virtue of their knowledge in &s;tate policy. It is the de&s;ign of civil government to &s;ecure the rights of men, which &s;hould be held &s;acred; it being &s;o nearly connected with religion, renders it important.&mdash;It is a &s;ubject to which we ought to pay attention, that we may be in a capacity to pur&s;ue the be&s;t mea&s;ures to promote it. It is a remark, not with|out foundation, that they who make the wide&s;t mouths again&s;t divine revelation, are commonly tho&s;e who know the lea&s;t about it, and form their opinion on popular cant. Whether this is not often the &s;afe with many who &s;et up again&s;t the good laws of the &s;tate, is a matter worthy of inquiry. He that can arraign and condemn the con&s;titu|tion and laws of his country without information, and will judge of a matter before he hears it, in the view of Solomon forfeits the character of a wi&s;e man.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is there &s;uch a connection between civil and religious order, then we ought to &s;upport the former, would we prove our&s;elves friends to the latter. Indeed he that can oppo&s;e and de&s;troy the good laws of his country, his re|ligious character is greatly to be &s;u&s;pected.&mdash;He that loves religion, will value and prize that which tends to its &s;upport, and feels the influence of the idea in the text, <HI>If the foundations be de&s;troyed, what &s;hall the righteous do?</HI> It is really the character of a good man, that he affords his influence, his property, yea his life in the defence of his country, if called for. We &s;hould mo&s;t chearfully im|part our &s;ub&s;tance for the &s;upport of the laws of the land, and &s;trengthen the hands of the legi&s;lature when they are endeavoring to adopt good mea&s;ures for rai&s;ing a revenue. Many are complaining, that the wages of the State officers are too high; were I to attempt a deci&s;ion on this point, perhaps I &s;hould appear contemptible, as being de&s;titure of chri&s;tian mode&s;ty and &s;elf-di&s;&s;idence.&mdash;That men who
<PB N="10" REF="033864_0010_0FF8DDDD8C2CDA10">
leave their families and devote their time and talents in their country's cau&s;e, ought to have a compen&s;ation is agreed on all hands,&mdash;what is an adequate reward, is dif|ficult for tho&s;e who live &s;everal hundred miles from the &s;eat of government to determine; an hone&s;t man under &s;uch a di&s;advantage would feel a delicacy in determining, le&s;t he might do inju&s;tice to his neighbor. He would not view that man qualified to be a repre&s;entative of the people that would be exorbitant in his demands; and rather choo&s;e to refer it to the members on the &s;pot, who are the be&s;t judges of their own expences and retrenchments. The common labourer thinks it an infringement on his liberty, if his wages are to be determined by him who hires him. Should we &s;et up office to vendue, and make <HI>low wages</HI> the te&s;t of our election, this would be an im|pious trifling with the &s;acred rights of men, an in&s;ult on the importance and dignity of government; in this way men of an ignorant, low and mercenary &s;pirit, would creep into the &s;eats of preferment.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Lord has taught us, by precept and exam|ple, to re&s;pect civil government, and to render tribute to Cae&s;ar. We have the &s;ame &s;entiments enjoined by St. Paul, Rom. xiii "Whoever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the power, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation. Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake. For this cau&s;e <HI>pay you tribute</HI> al&s;o: for they are God's mini&s;ters, attending continually upon this very thing. <HI>Render therefore to all their dues.</HI>"</P>
<P N="3">3. How ab&s;urd to di&s;card the book, commonly called the Holy Scriptures, and yet be advocates for good civil gov|ernment! They are &s;o coincident and congenial in their nature and tendency, that it is really a doubt whether a man can, upon right principles, be an hone&s;t advocate for one, who&s;e heart ri&s;es again&s;t the other. Hence it is, that tho&s;e who have been votaries for religion, have generally been friendly to good civil authority.<HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and thy neighbor as thy&s;elf,</HI> is an epitome of the whole Bible &s;y&s;tem. He that is ac|quainted
<PB N="11" REF="033864_0011_0FF8DB5DCE684F08">
with the laws of the land, will &s;ee that they mo&s;tly point to this great object, and are a &s;ort of com|ment on, or copy of the &s;acred oracles. A contempt of the Holy Scriptures, domination, anarchy, and immorality are in&s;eparable companions.</P>
<P>IT is, truly, &s;trange to &s;ee men of genius and education plead for the good laws of their country, and yet un|unfriendly to divine revelation; They have certainly a reciprocal reflection on each other, and their influence in a great mea&s;ure &s;tand and fall together.</P>
<P>WOULD we be hearty friends to government, let us value and conform to the written word of God, that our conduct may not appear glaringly incon&s;i&s;tent and contra|dictory.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE infer, That it is &s;uitable for the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel to enforce obedience to the laws of the &s;tate. In this way they di&s;cover a laudable regard for the rights and properties of their hearers, plead for religion, and e&s;pou&s;e the ca&s;e of their divine matter.</P>
<P>Many think that &s;tate policy is a &s;ubject out of the &s;phere of Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters, that they ought to &s;eek the peace and good will of their people, by avoiding &s;uch matters; but he that cannot &s;acrifice his own reputation, his living, yea, his own life in the cau&s;e of religion, and the good of his country, has forfeited his character as a faithful amba&s;&s;ador of the Prince of Peace.</P>
<P>PAUL was far from commending &s;uch clerical prudence as &s;ome plead for, Tit. iii. Put them in mind to be &s;ubject to principalities and powers, to obey magi&s;trates, to be ready to every good work, to &s;peak evil of no man.</P>
<P N="5">5. WE may learn, why there are &s;o many <HI>&s;edition acts</HI> in the Bible, &s;ince religion and good government are &s;o nearly connected. One we have, Eccle. x. 20, <HI>Cur&s;e not the king, no, not in thy thought.</HI> Another we have, Exod. xxii. 28. <HI>Thou &s;hall no revile the Gods, nor cur&s;e the ruler of thy people.</HI> We have the &s;ame law repeated in another &s;ection of God's word, Acts. xxv 5, <HI>Thou &s;hall not &s;peak evil of the ruler of thy people.</HI> Compare Rom. xiii, The Apo&s;tle
<PB N="12" REF="033864_0012_0FF97677DB0A8028">
gives us direction how to e&s;cape the terrors of &s;uch laws, verse 3. <HI>Do that which is good, and thou, &s;hall have prai&s;e of the &s;ame.</HI> When &s;candalous libels are ca&s;t at men in private life, they will have recour&s;e to law for &s;atisfaction when mini&s;ters of &s;tate are wickedly impeached, why &s;hould the libeller go with impunity? is not the crime enhanced by the dignity of the whole commonwealth? Shall the char|acter of a chief magi&s;trate, or of a whole country, be of le&s;s or of no more importance than a man in a private capacity? Can men think their liberties retrenched, when they cannot vent their &s;pite and fal&s;e invectives again&s;t civil rulers without detection? May we not as well cry out <HI>Ari&s;tocracy!&mdash;Tyranny!&mdash;and Oppre&s;&s;ion!</HI> becau&s;e we cannot commit the mo&s;t daring outrage on the per&s;on, character and property of our neighbor, without being plagued with the mole&s;ting hand of civil authority? From &s;uch kind of liberty, good Lord deliver us!<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Should it be &s;aid, that tho&s;e precepts, that particularly re&s;pect our duty to rulers, are rendered unnece&s;&s;ary by tho&s;e general laws that prohibit <HI>bearing fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t our neighbor,</HI> and that enjoin decent behaviour toward all mankind, &amp;c. We may ob&s;erve That wicked|ly to impeach men who are intru&s;ted with affairs of the common|wealth, is an in&s;ult ca&s;t upon the political body, tending to enervate the hands of government. If &s;ati&s;faction is given to the magi&s;trate only in a private capacity, this does not retrieve the character of the &s;tate, which has a right to enact and execute laws, with a more par|ticular relation to it&s;elf, tending to &s;upport its own dignity and im|portance.</NOTE></P>
<P N="6">6. THE &s;ubject &s;ets before us the importance of the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Since it is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to maintain civil government; our lives, liberties and religion, in a &s;en&s;e, depend upon it. Men &s;hould be appointed who are friendly to religion and morality, by which they will be peculiarly attached to the good and whole&s;ome laws of their county, on account of the benign influence they have on practical godline&s;s. Men of wi&s;dom and under|&s;t&s;anding, of force and &s;tability, who will enforce the laws of the land by precept and example; who will not bear the &s;word in vain, but be a terror to evil doers, and

a prai&s;e to them who do well. The&s;e are qualifications pointed out in the word of God, and ought to be &s;ought for. Di&s;&s;idence, in an eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil mini&s;ter, is a di&s;tingui&s;hing ornament. The magnitude of the object will cau&s;e the good &s;tate&s;man to recoil at the thought in language &s;imilar to that of the chief magi&s;trate of I&s;rael, I Kings, iii. "And now, O Lord my God, thou ha&s;t made me king in&s;tead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in. Give therefore thy &s;ervant an under&s;tanding heart, to judge thy people, that I may di&s;cern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy &s;o great a people?" He that would thru&s;t him&s;elf into office, is a &s;elfi&s;h man: is &s;eeking his own, not the public good. Confidence in pub|lic opinion will di&s;po&s;e a man to acquie&s;ce in their deci&s;|ions about him&s;elf, unbia&s;&s;ed by ful&s;ome flattery or brib|ery. He that would hire his neighbor to give him his &s;uffrage, is to be &s;u&s;pected as an enemy to his country, and unfit to be intru&s;ted with its impotant concerns. He has already declared that he values his own judgment about him&s;elf above all others, and will perhaps have the &s;ame &s;entiments in every thing in which he is called to act.</P>
<P>THE true philanthropi&s;t wants the &s;upport of his coun|try un&s;olicited, by which he is encouraged to undertake in its cau&s;e, and not from proud, &s;elfi&s;h or peculinary motives. The dignity, mode&s;ty and goodness of his mind, will render him incapable of holding him&s;elf up to view as a candidate for office.</P>
<P>SHOULD the question be a&s;ked, How &s;hall we know the man of virtue and patrioti&s;m? The an&s;wer is obvious, and rationally decided by unbearing wi&s;dom, <HI>By their fruit ye &s;hall know them.</HI></P>
<P>WE infer the integrity of a <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> and an <HI>Adams,</HI> from the invincible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> they have manife&s;ted to the rights of men, through a long &s;eries of events, when they had it in their power to all their country and accu|mulate

millions to them&s;elves. To &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch men, who have ri&s;ked their lives, their all, in the cau&s;e of free|dom for many years, &s;hould in the la&s;t &s;tage of life turn traitors, when they would have nothing to promi&s;e them|selves but endless di&s;grace, confronts every dictate of rea|&s;on and experience. Perhaps it is not possible for the human mind to have a firmer basis for confidence; and to impeach &s;uch characters, without better foundation than ever has appeared, to me, at lea&s;t appears di&s;ingenuous, and argues a jealou&s;y more cruel than the grave.</P>
<P>WHO can reflect on the fatigue, vexation, and hazard to which a WASHINGTON has been expo&s;ed in e&s;pou&s;ing the conte&s;ted rights of his country, and not feel a &s;ort of indigna|tion to hear his character villified and impeached without a cau&s;e? Are the&s;e the returns he is to receive from un|grateful countrymen!&mdash;It is true men are not to be idol|ized, but when we con&s;ider them as in&s;truments qualified and rai&s;ed up by God for great and peculiar &s;ervice to mankind, it is undoubtedly our duty to love, honor and respect them.</P>
<P>IF I am not mi&s;taken, we live in a day when our liber|ties are invaded, and the rights of men challenged beyond what we ever experienced, and that under the &s;oothing titles of <HI>Republicanism, Democracy,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e are precious names if well under&s;tood; but when they are &s;peciously &s;ubt&s;ituted in the room of <HI>libertini&s;m</HI> and <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> they make us &s;ick.</P>
<P>OUR internal di&s;&s;en&s;ions have an unfavorable a&s;pect and give pain to the human brea&s;t: by the&s;e things we lay our&s;elves open to foreign inva&s;ions, and augment taxation. Union and firmne&s;s is our country's cau&s;e becomes us at &s;uch a day as this&mdash;It is not a time for empty compli|ment; effeminate cowardice; nor for temporizing, when our all lies at &s;take. Our enemies with us to delay, and debate, and flatter, that they may make them&s;elves ma&s;ter of all our property at &s;ea.</P>
<P>THERE is no harm for the freeborn &s;ons of America to tell Frenchmen , That we will not give up our rights un|le&s;s

our lives go with them; that they were bought at the expence of too much blood and trea&s;ure to be trifled with.</P>
<P>THAT the very gho&s;ts of our brethren, who bled in their country's cau&s;e, would haunt our imaginations?&mdash;That we treat with contempt the in&s;olent demands of a Talleyrand, aided by a &s;ly intriguing Directory, who would wre&s;t millions from our pockets to en&s;lave us,&mdash;We may tell them in the mo&s;t dici&s;ive unequivocal lan|guage, without lo&s;s of time, That we have a right to choo&s;e our own Envoys, maintain our own neutrality, without the dictates of French de&s;poti&s;m. Have we any evidence that the French nation are really &s;eeking peace with us, while they refu&s;e to treat with our Amba&s;&s;ador, &s;uch as we &s;end to accompli&s;h th de&s;irable object? while they thru&s;t the dagger at our heart? de&s;troy our lives and property at every opportunity? May we not pertinently adopt the language of Jehu to Joram, II, Kings, ,ix. 22. And it came to pa&s;s when Joram &s;aw Jehu, that he &s;aid, Is it peace, Jehu? and he an&s;wered, What peace, &s;o long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel, and her witch|crafts, are &s;o many?</P>
<P>Do they wi&s;h for peace, let them come with the olive branch in their hand, and make us re&s;titution for the mil|lions of our property that they have wantonly de&s;troyed; and be a&s;hamed for the innocent blood that they have mingled with the ocean, which calls for vengeance on both &s;ides of the Atlantic. Then heaven-born peace &s;hall erect her laurels on our &s;hores, and gladden the heart of every free-born &s;on of America.</P>
<P>LET us ri&s;e in the defence of our country, and &s;hudder at the thought of a French invasion; viewing the la&s;t drop of our blood too &s;mall a &s;acrifice to be withheld when our rights, our religion, yea, our all lie at the &s;take. It is not the de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e to ob&s;truct a free and candid examination into political proceedings: this is a pity ledge belonging to every man, and no one has the right to take it from him.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="033864_0016_0FF8DB4FDF8EB858">IT is a matter worthy of &s;erious inquiry, whether other pre&s;ent con&s;titution and government have not the e&s;&s;ential ve&s;tiges of <HI>free republicani&s;m,</HI> according to the true mean|ing of the term. Does it not originate in the free &s;uffrages of the people; who have it in their power to appoint to, and depo&s;e from office? Is it an infringement of our lib|erties to &s;ubject to the deci&s;ion of the majority? True freedom does not con&s;i&s;t in every man's doing as he thinks fit, or following the dictates of unruly pa&s;&s;ions; but in &s;ubmitting to the ea&s;y yoke of good regulations and in being under the re&s;traints of whole&s;ome laws.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould do well to examine whether we do not too much de&s;pi&s;e and undervalue the civil government and independence that God by remarkable interpo&s;itions of providence has put into our hands. Whether our unea|&s;ine&s;s under it, has not provoked Omnipotence to threaten our liberties, by letting loo&s;e a foreign power upon us. Let us learn to prize and &s;upport the good and whole&s;ome laws of our land, that heaven may be at peace with us.</P>
<P>BUT few, if any will own them&s;elves advocates for French mea&s;ures; but I hope it will give no offence to tho&s;e who of late appear unfriendly to our pre&s;ent civil ad|mini&s;trations, if they are earne&s;tly intreated to inquire, whether they are not <HI>practically</HI> e&s;pou&s;ing their cau&s;e, however good their intentions may be. That our foreign enemies con&s;ider them in this point of light, we have the cleare&s;t evidence, and are thereby encouraged to per&s;evere in their lawless depredations.</P>
<P>WE have heard that it is the character of the good man to be &s;ubject to higher powers. That civil authority ought to be oppo&s;ed when it becomes tyrannical, and op|pre&s;&s;ive, is agreed on all hands. We &s;hould all do well to examine the motives by which we are actuated, perhaps they are &s;elfi&s;h. It is &s;ometimes a proud haughty di&s;po|&s;ition than &s;ets men again&s;t government, and a thir&s;t to get them&s;elves into the chair. This made Ab&s;alom so di&s;&s;at|i&s;fied with the government of I&s;rael, and caused him to di&s;&s;eminate di&s;&s;en&s;ions among them, II. Sam. xv. 4. <HI>Ab|&s;alom

&s;aid, moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which harb any &s;uit or cau&s;e might come unto me, and I would do them ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>ON the whole, let us in all the&s;e things view the hand of &s;uperintending Providence, that ruleth over the na|tions of the earth, and di&s;po&s;eth of all events, both in the natural and moral world, &s;o as to accompli&s;h the be&s;t good of the univer&s;e; will cau&s;e even the wrath of man to prai&s;e him, and the remainder will re&s;train.</P>
<P>LET us repent of our &s;ins, that are the cau&s;e of God's controver&s;y with us, and obtain reconciliation with him through the mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Let us &s;eek after a holy union of &s;entiment and affection in religion and this will tend to unite us in other things, and e&s;pecially in that which is in &s;ome &s;ense the barrier and &s;upport of it. The que&s;tion would then become &s;erious and general. If the foundations be de&s;troyed what &s;hall the righteous do? Let us &s;upport and execute the good laws of our land and endeavor to &s;trengthen the hands of them who rule well. Let no root of bitterne&s;s &s;pring up and trouble us, for while the mind is under the influence of prejudice and pa&s;&s;ion we cannot attend to any &s;ubject to advantage. We s&s;ould exerci&s;e a &s;pirit of love and forbearance to|wards tho&s;e who differ from us, and endeavor to re&s;tore them in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s. May we all remember that whatever zeal or attachment we may &s;eem to manife&s;t towards civil in&s;titutions; yet if we are not in our hearts and lives in &s;ome good mea&s;ure reconciled to the law and government of God, we &s;hall finally be placed with the workers of iniquity.</P>
