<BIBL>DANIEL, ii. 44.</BIBL>
<Q>In the days of the&s;e Kings, &s;hall the <HI>GOD</HI> of Hea|ven &s;et up a kingdom which &s;hall never be de|&s;troyed; and the kingdom &s;hall not be left to other people; but it &s;hall break in pieces, and con&s;ume all the&s;e kingdoms, and it &s;hall &s;tand forever.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN our LORD JESUS was about to a&s;cend from earth to heaven, having fini&s;hed the glorious work for which he came, he gave in charge to his immediate followers, to go forth and <HI>di&s;ciple</HI> all nations. This com|mi&s;&s;ion he was plea&s;ed to preface with the&s;e words: <Q><HI>All power in heaven and in earth, is given unto me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;ame divine per&s;on many ages before, appeared to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the Hebrew law-giver, and
<PB N="6" REF="022118_0005_0FB6D5C563512340">
&s;pake from the burning bu&s;h, when he gave him commi&s;&s;ion to go for the redemption of his people from their &s;evere bondage, by the name of "I AM THAT I AM:" And told him to &s;ay "I AM" hath &s;ent me. It was HE al&s;o who, many years after, appeared to <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> the commander in chief of the Hebrew bands, by the name of the <HI>"Captain of the Lord's ho&s;t."</HI></P>
<P>IN the Proverbs of king <HI>Solomon,</HI> divinely dictated, under the name of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> this &s;ame divine Being makes no he&s;itation to declare, <Q><HI>By</HI> ME <HI>kings reign and princes decree ju&s;tice; by</HI> ME <HI>princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HIS holy apo&s;tle declares that <Q><HI>God hath exalted him far above all principality and power, and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but al&s;o in that which is to come:</HI></Q> that <Q><HI>all things are put under his feet,</HI></Q> and that <Q><HI>he is given to be head over all things to the church.</HI></Q></P>
<P>FROM all which we &s;afely conclude, that ab|&s;olute DOMINION belongs to the LORD JESUS CHRIST. And that all the limited authority, dominion and power, to be found among men, is, either mediately or immediately derived from him.</P>
<P><Q>THE power of tho&s;e who are exalted to &s;eats of government,</Q> &s;aid a venerable father on a like occa&s;ion, almo&s;t a century pa&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. Bulkley's Election Sermon.</NOTE> <Q>is
<PB N="7" REF="022118_0006_0FB6D5C6E0813A60">
from HIM. Whatever the particular in&s;tru|ments or means of conveying this power, and ve&s;ting it in the&s;e and tho&s;e particular per|&s;ons, may be: yet the power it&s;elf is from GOD, a ray of His. In elective &s;tates where per&s;ons are advanced by the &s;uffrages of o|thers, to places of rule, and ve&s;ted with civil power; the per&s;ons chu&s;ing, give not the power, but GOD. They are but the in&s;tru|ments of conveyance, and do but de&s;ign, i. e. <HI>nominate,</HI> the per&s;ons that &s;hall receive it from Him.</Q></P>
<P>HENCE it is HE, who in his holy providence, putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another. HE exalted even heathen princes&mdash;rai&s;ed up a <HI>Pha|raoh,</HI> called <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> his &s;ervant, and <HI>Cyrus</HI> his &s;hepherd and his anointed.</P>
<P>THIS divine IMMANUEL was plea&s;ed, in the vi&s;ions of the night, to give to an heathen <HI>de&s;|pot,</HI> &s;ome intimations of the glory and &s;ucce&s;s of HIS KINGDOM on earth.</P>
<P>IT is hoped it will not be thought un&s;ea&s;on|able, if the &s;peaker humbly invite the attention of this very re&s;pectable auditory for a few min|utes, to that KING and KINGDOM which hath no end. E&s;pecially when it is remembered that it is his duty and bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;tudy its laws and maxims, to endeavor to proclaim its beauties, and to per&s;uade his fellow-men, to &s;eek fir&s;t its righteou&s;ne&s;s, pro&s;perity and glory.</P>
<P>THE context, it is pre&s;umed, is &s;o well re|membered
<PB N="8" REF="022118_0007_0FB6D5C8627DF8A8">
by all who con&s;ult the &s;acred pages, that it precludes the nece&s;&s;ity of any rehear&s;al. The image that appeared to &s;tand before the a&s;toni&s;hed prince, is &s;o particularly de&s;cribed and &s;o minutely interpreted, as renders a repe|tition needle&s;s. Great numbers in this auditory have, no doubt, received profitable in&s;truction, as well as plea&s;ing entertainment, in reading in antient hi&s;tory, a more full account of the pro|phet's prediction, of which this chapter contains only the out-lines.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve therefore, from the text, that a glorious kingdom is to be &s;et up; and that it is to be &s;et up, in the mid&s;t of the chan|ges and overturnings of earthly dominion and greatne&s;s. Agreeably to the prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> who was contemporary with the one who gave us our text. "I will overturn, overturn, over|turn it, i. e. dominion, and <HI>it</HI> &s;hall be no more."</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Chaldean</HI> dominion was transferred into the hands of the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> thence into the hands of the <HI>Grecian</HI> conqueror, and from the <HI>Greeks</HI> to the <HI>Romans.</HI> This la&s;t empire arriv|ing at the highe&s;t pinnacle of earthly glory: HE, <HI>who&s;e right it is,</HI> even the LORD from hea|ven&mdash;the LORD JESUS appeared to lay the foundation of this kingdom &s;poken of in our text.</P>
<P>BE plea&s;ed further to ob&s;erve, that this king|dom <HI>&s;hall never be de&s;troyed.</HI> While the formi|dable empires and mighty kingdoms of this world, in their turn, ri&s;e and fall, yea, become
<PB N="9" REF="022118_0008_0FB6D5DFA7A2E578">
extinct and forgotten; this kingdom &s;hall abide and remain&mdash;&s;hall out live and be an attendant on the funeral of all the &s;hort-lived dominions of the earth. Moreover, that it &s;hall <HI>brake in pieces and con&s;ume</HI> all tho&s;e that are in oppo&s;ition to it; or bring into it, <HI>crowns</HI> and <HI>&s;ceptres</HI>&mdash;ab|&s;orb all earthly powers, and make them contri|bute to its progre&s;s, advancement and glory.</P>
<P>I HAVE now to a&s;k your attention, to <HI>the &s;u|preme</HI> RULER <HI>in this kingdom&mdash;The nature of its laws and maxims&mdash;and the character of its &s;ubjects.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;upreme ruler in this kingdom is none other than the LORD JESUS CHRIST. He who made all things, and by whom all things con|&s;i&s;t. He who thought it not robbery to be equal with GOD: but made him&s;elf of no rep|utation, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the <HI>cro&s;s.</HI> And this, that he might erect a kingdom on earth, and with &s;uch &s;ub|jects as a lap&s;ed world is compo&s;ed of; even &s;in|ners and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors again&s;t their GOD.</P>
<P>FOR this, it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould pur|cha&s;e and redeem them, and that with the price of his own BLOOD&mdash;That he &s;hould a&s;&s;ert the rectitude of the divine admini&s;tration, the equi|ty and goodne&s;s of his LAW; which could not be, but by his <HI>obedience</HI> and <HI>&s;acrifice.</HI> This therefore he chearfully undertook. <Q>Behold I come, in the volume of the book it is writ|ten of me, to do thy will, O GOD.</Q> In or|der for the accompli&s;hment of which, he ap|peared meek and lowly; &s;ubmitted to the
<PB N="10" REF="022118_0009_0FB6D5E0611548B8">
reproaches and indignities of wicked men&mdash;to be accounted mean and contemptible, and when he was reviled, reviled not again. He was full of philanthropy, went about doing good, and was emphatically the &s;inner's friend.</P>
<P>HIS obedience in his threefold character, as a <HI>Man,</HI> a <HI>Jew</HI> and a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> was perfect and per&s;evering; his &s;ufferings and death meritori|ous, and his re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion, certain and triumphant.</P>
<P>THIS divine Ruler is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every perfec|tion &s;uited to be the great head of this kingdom. He is now continually operating in the cour&s;e of his all-governing providence, with &s;uch wi&s;|dom, power and goodne&s;s, as to make all things &s;ub&s;ervient to his grand de&s;ign, in bringing glory to GOD, and happine&s;s to the &s;y&s;tem of in|telligence. <Q>He maketh his angels &s;pirits, and his mini&s;ters a flame of fire.</Q> He con|ducts the affairs of this world in &s;uch a manner, as is be&s;t calculated to promote, and mo&s;t wi&s;ely adapted to advance, the intere&s;ts of this king|dom on earth. When <Q>the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing:</Q> He &s;it|teth in the heavens and laugheth at their folly. When the kings and potentates of the earth take coun&s;el together, and &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t him; <Q>He da&s;heth them in pieces like a pot|ter's ve&s;&s;el.</Q></P>
<P>FROM the earlie&s;t ages, He hath &s;o ordered the events of time, that the ri&s;e and fall of na|tions&mdash;the revolutions and changes which have
<PB N="11" REF="022118_0010_0FB6D6016470C028">
come to pa&s;s, among the generations of men; have all contributed to bring forward the medi|atorial plan, and will, in i&s;&s;ue, produce a large revenue of glory to the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>NOR is this kingdom propagated by fire and &s;word, or by the arts and &s;tratagems of war; by which indeed mo&s;t of the kingdoms of this world have been &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;hed: but by the &s;till &s;mall voice of the <HI>divine &s;pirit</HI>&mdash;by hea|venly influence on the minds of men; without noi&s;e, pomp and magnificence: For <Q>this king|dom cometh not with ob&s;ervation.</Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;upreme King of Zion, not only di&s;ap|points and confounds the devices of tho&s;e who are in oppo&s;ition to his kingdom; but rules in the hearts of his people by love. As his ad|mini&s;trations are all wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good; &s;o the laws, precepts and maxims by which he governs, are excellent and divine. To <HI>the&s;e</HI> then in the <HI>next place,</HI> I am to a&s;k your attention.</P>
<P>THIS is the only ab&s;olute monarchy we know of, that is without its faults. Monarchical go|vernment, we may, perhaps, be allowed to &s;ay, is the be&s;t in the univer&s;e, provided the mo|narch be wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good. But &s;uch are the imperfections and corruptions attendant on lap&s;|ed degenerate men, that it is exceedingly dan|gerous to erect &s;uch a government in our world; le&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion and violence &s;hould &s;talk uncon|trouled, and mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s be &s;till more accumulated among the children of men.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="022118_0011_0FB6D602E82CA718">
THE hi&s;tory of pa&s;t ages exhibits a hideous portrait of the di&s;mal effects of ab&s;olute de&s;|potic government. <Q>What mighty ble&s;&s;ings to mankind,</Q> remarks a worthy divine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Dr. Williams, of Lebanon.</NOTE> on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, <Q>were the famous <HI>Ninus, Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander,</HI> yea even <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and later heroes of that &s;ort; who have been celebrated in the records of fame? What did they ever do, but butcher mankind? ravage, rob and plunder millions better than them&s;elves? And to what other end, but to &s;erve their own lawle&s;s and unbridled lu&s;ts? What were their mo&s;t celebrated virtues, but the wonderful genero&s;ity of giving tho&s;e rich|es, honors and privileges to &s;ome of their &s;laves, which they had fir&s;t unrighteou&s;ly got|ton into their power, and taken from others?</Q></P>
<P>BUT in the government we are contemplat|ing, although it is ab&s;olute monarchy, it is, ne|verthele&s;s, the mo&s;t wi&s;e, equitable and mild. The laws in this kingdom are, indeed, calculat|ed to bring glory and dignity to the prince&mdash;to exalt the &s;overeign: yet al&s;o to &s;ecure the lib|erty and felicity of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>A FUNDAMENTAL law in this kingdom is LOVE. <Q>Thou &s;halt love the LORD thy GOD with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thy|&s;elf.</Q> On this, all the rules, &s;tatutes and maxims of this kingdom are founded.</P>
<P>As the glorious Ruler him&s;elf was full of love
<PB N="13" REF="022118_0012_0FB6D61DD6028580">
to GOD, and benevolence to mankind, &s;o he re|quireth the exerci&s;e of this capital virtue, in all his &s;ubjects. This con&s;titutes order and peace, and lays a foundation for a mo&s;t agreeable and happy &s;ociety.</P>
<P>JUSTICE, integrity and uprightne&s;s, are urg|ed, as mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites for the conduct of all the &s;ubjects of this kingdom. It is a mo&s;t important maxim given and in&s;i&s;ted on, by the glorious Legi&s;lator, <Q>As ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye al&s;o to them like|wi&s;e.</Q> This is that which the LORD requir|eth, "to do ju&s;tly and love mercy."</P>
<P>IT is an important direction in this kingdom to render to all their dues. Various are the re|lations and different the offices to be &s;u&s;tained in &s;ocial connection, whether in civil or religi|ous life. And hence different duties and obli|gations ari&s;e; according to the various &s;tations among men, in which, by divine Providence, they are placed. Hence rules are pre&s;cribed. He that <HI>ruleth</HI> is required to rule <Q>with dili|gence.</Q> And to <Q>be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> ruling in the fear of GOD.</Q> To be a <Q>terror to evil-doers, and a prai&s;e to &s;uch as do well.</Q> He is to con&s;ider him&s;elf as "GOD's mini&s;ter," attend|ing continually on this very thing.</P>
<P>OF <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> it is al&s;o required, that they "&s;ubmit to the ordinances of men"&mdash;and <Q>be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con|&s;cience &s;ake.</Q> And of him that <HI>teacheth,</HI> it is required "that he wait on teaching"&mdash;and
<PB N="14" REF="022118_0013_0FB6D6200BA362A8">
<Q>give him&s;elf wholly to the&s;e things, that his profiting may appear.</Q> In a word, the rule is, <Q>let every man abide in the calling where|in he is called</Q>&mdash;and <Q>render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, honor to whom honor, and fear to whom fear.</Q></P>
<P>BENEFICENCE is al&s;o required of the &s;ubjects of CHRIST'S kingdom. Not only that benevo|lent affection be exerci&s;ed; but that it be ex|pre&s;&s;ed in beneficent actions and conduct to|wards our fellow-men. The rule adopted is, <Q>look not every man at his own things, but every man al&s;o, at the things of others.</Q> In oppo&s;ition to that narrow and contracted &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, which is &s;o incompatible with all moral and &s;ocial virtue.</P>
<P>TRUTH and &s;incerity, in oppo&s;ition to hypo|cri&s;y, and artful di&s;&s;imulation is &s;trongly urged, as a nece&s;&s;ary regulation for the conduct of the &s;ubjects of this dominion. An open and hone&s;t frankne&s;s in communication, with <Q>yea, yea, nay, nay,</Q> ina&s;much as <Q>what&s;oever is more than this, cometh of evil.</Q> To the&s;e may be added, &s;obriety, temperance and charity, as di&s;|tingui&s;hing ornaments of tho&s;e who belong to a kingdom which is never to have an end.</P>
<P>I ONLY add here, that cheerful, uniform and per&s;evering obedience to the&s;e, and all the com|mands of CHRIST JESUS, is &s;trictly enjoined: For it is "he that endureth to the end, that &s;hall be &s;aved." But the bare mention of all the laws and maxims of this kingdom, would
<PB N="15" REF="022118_0014_0FB6D620E13A4960">
be to copy a con&s;iderable part of the New-Te&s;|tament. Give me leave to &s;ugge&s;t one thought more, under this head of di&s;cour&s;e and it &s;hall be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: and that is, that as the laws in this kingdom are all founded in con&s;ummate wi&s;|dom; &s;o they are not too many, nor too few&mdash;they need no amendments, nor do they ever re|quire any repeal. Such is the imperfection that attends the human-kind, that the wi&s;e&s;t con&s;ti|tution that can be formed by men, and laws and &s;tatutes thence ari&s;ing, may, and often are, at|tended with mi&s;chievous and unhappy effects. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee, with preci&s;ion, their operation, &s;o as to prevent them. Hence ari&s;eth the nece&s;&s;ity of alteration and change, in legi&s;|lation, and con&s;equently in admini&s;tring upon it. But in&s;tability in government, ever di&s;po|&s;es to di&s;content and faction. The&s;e things are in a greater or le&s;s degree, nece&s;&s;ary attendants on this imperfect &s;tate&mdash;&s;uch is the &s;ituation of our world. But in the kingdom of the RE|DEEMER, the con&s;titution is perfect&mdash;the laws and rules con&s;ummately wi&s;e, and the admini&s;|tration, of con&s;equence, perfectly equitable and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>I HAVE now in the la&s;t place, to reque&s;t your attention to <HI>the character of the &s;ubjects</HI> of this dominion, of which we have been &s;peaking. And if in doing this, we find the principal out|lines of the truly virtuous and godly man&mdash;the chief characteri&s;tics of the <HI>real chri&s;tian;</HI> it is hoped, it will not be deemed a mi&s;pending the time. For I may pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert, that it is our highe&s;t honor, and will be our greate&s;t feli|city
<PB N="16" REF="022118_0015_0FB6D6226323A6B8">
to be truly religious&mdash;to be real chri&s;tians; whatever be our &s;tations and employments in this uncertain world. The &s;peaker would be under&s;tood therefore, by delineating the charac|ter, humbly to recommend it.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubjects of this kingdom partake of the &s;ame &s;pirit and temper of their glorious Ruler and Lord&mdash;and they walk in &s;ome mea&s;ure even as he walked. They are endued with a princi|ple of real virtue, being born from above. This lays a foundation for virtuous conduct, and holy practice, both towards GOD, them|&s;elves, and mankind. They exerci&s;e <Q><HI>Repen|tance</HI> toward GOD, and <HI>Faith</HI> in the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</Q> Sen&s;ible they are &s;inners, and of con&s;equence, under a forfeiture of the divine favour: they look to the free mercy of GOD, through the <HI>atonement</HI> of CHRIST, for pardon and acceptance unto eternal life. They are (acting in character, and in this view it is in|tended to con&s;ider them) &s;trongly attached to their Prince. They are voluntary in his &s;er|vice&mdash;are not &s;ubjects by con&s;traint; but find that in being obedient, and in <Q>keeping his commands there is a great reward</Q>&mdash;and that "his yoke is ea&s;y and his burden light."</P>
<P>SUCH is their love and attachment to their Sovereign and Lord, that they have a tender concern for his honor and intere&s;t, and his glory ever lies near their hearts: For when they <Q>be|hold the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors they are grieved.</Q> As they love GOD, &s;o they love mankind&mdash;they are di&s;po&s;ed, as they have opportunity, to do good
<PB N="17" REF="022118_0016_0FB6D6242876BFD8">
to all. They love not only their friends, but their enemies. Their benevolent affection is not bounded by their peculiar connections, nor circum&s;cribed with their own community or na|tion: but their philanthropy extends to all man|kind.</P>
<P>ANOTHER characteri&s;tic of the &s;ubjects of this kingdom is, they are &s;olicitous to approve them&s;elves faithful in their &s;tations. Agreeably to the rule given: <Q>Let every man abide in the &s;ame calling wherein he is called.</Q> And are diligent in improving the talents committed to them, be they more or le&s;s; feeling the weight of that charge, "Occupy until I come."&mdash;They keep in mind, that they are amenable to their glorious LORD, for the privileges they enjoy, and betru&s;tments committed to them. They fear the doom of the &s;lothful &s;ervant, and are anxious to obtain the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Euge</HI> pronounced on the faithful ones.</P>
<P>MOREOVER the &s;ubjects of this kingdom are quiet and peaceable members of the communi|ty, to which the providence of GOD hath joined them.

<P>I ADD, the &s;ubjects of this kingdom are men of <HI>prayer;</HI> and entertain a &s;acred regard for the chri&s;tian in&s;titutions.

<P>IN fine, they endeavor to keep a con&s;cience void of offence, both toward GOD, and toward man.

How glorious his per&s;on, how exalted his king|dom, how excellent his laws&mdash;how wi&s;e his ad|mini&s;trations, and how happy his &s;ubjects. Is all power in heaven and earth given unto Him? Is it by Him, kings reign and princes decree ju&s;tice? By Him, do princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth&mdash;and doth his kingdom extend over and ab&s;orb all others?&mdash;Then it is ea&s;y and natural to conclude, that all authority and power, &s;hort of Him, when view|ed on a large &s;cale, is only executive. By Him, and under Him they rule and govern, are exe|cuting his purpo&s;es, and bringing about the in|finitely benevolent de&s;igns of his heart.</P>
<P>THE chri&s;tian ruler, the really virtuous, who are in authority, will rejoice to &s;ub&s;erve the in|tere&s;ts of his kingdom. They will contribute all in their power, to promote the greate&s;t good&mdash;the honor of the REDEEMER and the be&s;t good of mankind. They will feel that it is a privilege, as well as an honor, to be by Him furni&s;hed with &s;uperior abilities, and placed in circum|&s;tances, to imitate their divine LORD in <HI>doing good</HI>&mdash;in &s;eeking to diffu&s;e happine&s;s around them.

<P>IT is a ju&s;t remark of a truly <HI>great man,</HI> that the vi&s;ible kingdom of CHRIST, from its fir&s;t ri&s;e, is making its progre&s;s towards the <HI>We&s;t.</HI> A va&s;t, an immen&s;e, yea in great part, an un|known territory lies before us in that <HI>direction.</HI> And, &s;o far as it hath been explored, for fruit|fulne&s;s of &s;oil, mildne&s;s of climate, and &s;uperior advantages of inland navigation, equals, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;es any other part of the <HI>globe.</HI> Hitherto it hath been occupied, by little more than &s;avage bea&s;ts and &s;avage men.

<P>It belongs not to me, Gentlemen, to dictate to you how to rule&mdash;what mu&s;t be done, or what not be done, in your legi&s;lative or executive de|partments. Ye your&s;elves know what are the exigencies of, and what the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions for the commonwealth, and to you, a particular attention to this duty belongs. You will there|fore make the general welfare your grand ob|ject, in all your con&s;ultations and re&s;olves.</P>
<P>INDULGE me, honored Gentlemen, the free|dom to intreat you all to become the willing &s;ubjects of that kingdom, which &s;hall flouri&s;h when all earthly power and authority, &s;hall no more be needed. And to make the laws and maxims of that Supreme Ruler, who&s;e character we have de&s;cribed, the mea&s;ure of your conduct, in your political as well as private capacities. I may not doubt, honored Sirs, you will bear in mind, that you are accountable to him, and that his eye is ever upon you.</P>

YOU are, when in A&s;&s;embly met, acting in a legi&s;lative capacity, and many, if not mo&s;t of you, when di&s;per&s;ed, are called to act in judi|cial and executive departments. In each and in every character you &s;u&s;tain; if you "fear GOD" like <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of old, you will indeed be pillars and &s;upporters of our republic. Should you keep in mind that you are, not only amena|ble to the public; but that you mu&s;t give an account to that Supreme Judge, who&s;e eye be|holds the &s;ecret &s;prings and motives of every heart; and let this be uppermo&s;t in your minds; you will then hardly do ami&s;s: But, de&s;titute of benevolence and virtuous principle, as the great <HI>Pole-&s;tar</HI> to influence and guide you; al|though your knowledge and abilities may be great; you will be in danger of &s;hip-wreck&mdash;of bringing ruin on your&s;elves and tho&s;e who are embarked with you.</P>
<P>WORTHY Gentlemen, we ardently de&s;ire and devoutly wi&s;h you the divine guidance, the gra|cious pre&s;ence, and ble&s;&s;ing of the Supreme Ruler&mdash;the LORD JESUS CHRIST&mdash;and that by wi&s;e and judicious precept, and faithful corre&s;|pondent example, you may be great ble&s;&s;ings in life, and, through grace, accepted at death, and made happy when your places &s;hall no more be found in this uncertain world.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day doth not call for the &s;pecial attention of the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> any farther than that they &s;hew them|&s;elves friendly and &s;olicitous to promote in their <HI>line,</HI> the general good; and meet in convention

to cultivate harmony, and &s;trengthen and a&s;&s;i&s;t one another, in the important bu&s;ine&s;s in which they are called to act: yet the &s;ubject of the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, exhibiting the nature and importance of that divine and glorious king|dom, in which they are called more immediate|ly to labour; will allow a word from one who e&s;teems it a privilege to be accounted one of their brethren.</P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration, <HI>My Reverend Fathers and dear Brethren,</HI> that the kingdom of the divine REDEEMER &s;hall &s;urvive all others, and that by His providence, others &s;hall be made &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to its intere&s;ts&mdash;The con&s;ideration al&s;o, of the utility and importance of civil government to promote the intere&s;ts of this kingdom; &s;hould fill our hearts with joy and gladne&s;s, and ani|mate us to a diligent and laborious attention to the work, whereunto we are called.</P>
<P>To <HI>us,</HI> ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, even to us, is this grace given, to preach among our fellow-men, our fellow-&s;inners, <Q>the un&s;earchable riches of CHRIST.</Q>&mdash;To exhibit the character of the REDEEMER&mdash;to unfold, explain, and enforce the laws and maxims of his kingdom, and to be&s;eech lap&s;ed men <Q>in CHRIST's &s;tead, to be recon|ciled to GOD.</Q></P>
<P>IF this employment as the antient divines u&s;ed to &s;ay, is <Q>formidable to the &s;houlders of angels;</Q> what mu&s;t it be in our view, when we con&s;ider our&s;elves, equally involved in the apo&s;tacy, guilt and ruin of our fellow-men?</P>

SHOULD we not ever entertain an abiding &s;en&s;e of our own in&s;ufficiency, and continually look to JESUS our divine Ma&s;ter, for needful grace and aid, to enable us to the faithful di&s;|charge of our important tru&s;ts. And while we are favored with the protection and countenance of our civil fathers, we are under better advan|tages to do good among our people for both worlds. They will readily tell us, that by faith|fully attending, to the duties of our office&mdash;by public and private precept and exhortation, en|forced by proper and becoming example; we may do much towards the peace and order of &s;ociety, and good of the commonwealth. This, then &s;hould be a powerful &s;timulus to faithful and laborious exertion in our profe&s;&s;ion. But when we reflect on the exalted glory of the RE|DEEMER&mdash;the infinite importance of the &s;pread of his kingdom&mdash;the glorious things &s;poken for the city of our GOD&mdash;the peri&s;hing condition mankind are in by &s;in&mdash;the door of mercy open|ed in the go&s;pel, and the &s;olemn account we &s;hall &s;oon be required to render of our mini&s;try. When we reflect on the&s;e things, &s;urely we &s;hall be humble, prayerful, watchful, zealous and en|gaged in every branch of our arduous work. We &s;hall &s;trive together in love for the faith of the go&s;pel, and the promotion of that dear cau&s;e which we have e&s;pou&s;ed. We &s;hall abound in love to our common LORD, in love to one ano|ther, and tender benevolence to mankind. And when one and another of our fathers and brethren are &s;ummoned off, from the wall of our Jeru&s;alem, calling on us as they go; to make ha&s;te&mdash;to fini&s;h our mini&s;try and follow them;

<P>I WILL detain this numerous auditory no longer, than only to be&s;eech your attention, <HI>My Brethren and Fellow-Citizens,</HI> to that glorious <HI>Ruler</HI> and that ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Kingdom,</HI> which hath been briefly de&s;cribed. Suffer me to a&s;k you, my friends, what think you of CHRIST&mdash;what think you of his kingdom&mdash;what think you of the fi|nal happy condition of his &s;ubjects? Permit me to exhort and charge you all, to become the faithful and loyal &s;ubjects of this Prince of Peace.&mdash;In his own words, to <Q>&s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of GOD.</Q> Your peace and quiet in this world; but e&s;pecially your comfort in death, and your happine&s;s in the world to come, depends on your &s;peedy compliance with this, his exhortation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>day</HI> and <HI>age</HI> in which we live is evil. The preachers have been wont on the&s;e mo&s;t public occa&s;ions, to &s;hew to our <HI>I&s;rael</HI> <Q>their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</Q> And may not he who now &s;peaketh be allowed to bear a te&s;timony again&s;t the prevailing evils which threaten our ruin&mdash;which pre&s;age the awful di&s;plays of divine in|dignation, and call for the uplifting hand of a &s;in-revenging GOD. When he dares to make mention of them, he feels the more undaunted, from a con&s;cious per&s;ua&s;ion that he hath the fa|vor and countenance, not only of his <HI>Excellency</HI>

who hath commanded him to &s;peak this day, and the honorable legi&s;lative body&mdash;together with the concurrence of his brethren of the &s;a|cred character and all &s;erious men: but al&s;o the approbation of his GOD. He dares then to &s;ay, <HI>O Connecticut,</HI> how art thou fallen! Once fa|mous for benevolence, righteou&s;ne&s;s and the fear of GOD&mdash;for the belief and practice of religion&mdash;even the religion of JESUS, which alone brings &s;inners to heaven. Now abounding with im|penitence, infidelity and all manner of impie|ties.&mdash;The precious word of GOD di&s;regarded.&mdash;The holy &s;abbath treated with growing ne|glect.&mdash;The &s;acred in&s;titutions of the LORD JESUS, by many di&s;pi&s;ed.&mdash;Family-prayer aw|fully out of fa&s;hion. And of con&s;equence, all manner of violations of the duties we owe to one another. Inju&s;tice, fraud, violence, pro|fane&s;s, debauchery, intemperance, deceit, fal&s;|hood, and covetou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;the&s;e and many more evils which are the genuine offspring of the&s;e; too much mark our towns and communities. Meanwhile the God of our Fathers in anger withdrawn, and the nece&s;&s;ary influences of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit withheld!&mdash;Is it not time to &s;top in our career, and enquire&mdash;where are we&mdash;and what mu&s;t we expect? Hath not the Mo&s;t High given us a gentle rebuke in cutting &s;hort, both the harve&s;ts in the year pa&s;t, and thereby cau&s;ed the cries of the poor to be more than u&s;ually heard for <HI>bread.</HI></P>
<P>WE have heretofore, felt the rod of the Al|mighty, in the de&s;olations of <HI>war,</HI> and in the de&s;tructions of the <HI>pe&s;tilence</HI> that walketh in

darkne&s;s: but have, as yet, GOD be thanked, been &s;trangers to the horrors of <HI>famine.</HI> Have we not rea&s;on to tremble, and be <Q>afraid of his righteous judgments?</Q> General and open impieties, are followed with public and &s;ore judgments. Let us open our eyes and &s;ee&mdash;re|ceive conviction, repent and reform.</P>
<P>BRETHREN, the time is &s;hort. Religion is a reality. Go&s;pel truths all-important. The concerns of eternity weighty and momentous. The retributions of the la&s;t great day, glorious and awful. To leave the paths of &s;in&mdash;to for|&s;ake the ways of the de&s;troyer&mdash;to become friends to the LORD JESUS, and lovers of man|kind: this will &s;ecure the favor of GOD&mdash;will make us a happy people. This will make us good citizens and good &s;ubjects. This will make it ea&s;y to rule, and to be ruled; each one attending to the duties of his own proper &s;ta|tion. Then &s;hall we &s;trive together to promote the general good. So &s;hall we behold our <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI> built up&mdash;this, a land of light, liberty and religion&mdash;our country grow and increa&s;e&mdash;our empire enlarge and extend&mdash;and that di|vine kingdom, which &s;hall ab&s;orb all others, &s;pread and prevail, <Q>till the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the glory of the LORD.</Q> Then <Q><HI>violence &s;hall no more be heard in thy land, wa&s;ting and de&s;truction within thy bor|ders: But thou &s;halt call thy walls &s;alvation, and thy gates prai&s;e.</HI></Q></P>
