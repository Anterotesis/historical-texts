<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_IT was with no &s;mall Difficulty that the Author's Youth and Mode&s;ty were prevail'd on to let him appear a Preacher in our public Lecture, and afterwards to give us a Copy of his Di&s;cour&s;e, at the De&s;ire of divers, Mini&s;ters and Others, who heard it. But as we quickly found him a Workman that needs not to be a&s;hamed before his Brethren; our Satisfaction was the greater to &s;ee him pitching upon &s;o noble a <HI>Subject,</HI> and treating it with &s;o much &s;trength and clearne&s;s as the judicious Reader will perceive in the following Compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>A Subject which &s;ecures to God his great De&s;ign in the Work of fallen Man's Redemption by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is evidently &s;o laid out as that the Glory of the whole &s;hould return to Him the ble&s;&s;ed Ordainer, Pur|cha&s;er and Applier. A Subject which enters deep into practical Religion; without the Belief of which, <HI>that</HI> mu&s;t &s;oon die in the hearts and lives of Men.</P>
<P>For in proportion to the &s;en&s;e we have of our Depen|dance on the Sovereign GOD, for all the good we want, will be our Value for Him, our Application to Him, our Tru&s;t in Him, our Fear to offend Him, and our Care to plea&s;e Him; as likewi&s;e our Gratitude &amp; Love, our De|light and Prai&s;e, upon our &s;en&s;ible Experience of his free Benefits.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, It is the very <HI>Soul of Piety</HI> to apprehend and own, That all our Springs are in Him; the Springs of our pre&s;ent Grace and Comfort, and of our future Glory and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and that they all intirely flow thro' <HI>CHRIST</HI> by the efficacious Influence of the <HI>HOLY SPIRIT.</HI> By <HI>the&s;e things</HI> Saints <HI>live, and in all the&s;e things is the Life of our Spirits.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="003415_0004_0FF8389D0DC95BA0">Such Doctrines as the&s;e, which by humbling the Minds of Men, prepare them for the Exaltations of GOD, He has &s;ignally own'd and pro&s;per'd in the reformed World, and in our Land e&s;pecially in the Days of our Fore-fathers; and we hope they will never grow unfa&s;hionable among us: For, we are well a&s;&s;ured, if tho&s;e which we call the <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> ever come to be contemn'd or di&s;reli&s;hed, vital Piety will proportionably langui&s;h and wear away; as the&s;e Doctrines always &s;ink in the E&s;teem of Men, upon the De|cay of &s;erious Religion.</P>
<P>We cannot therefore but expre&s;s our Joy and Thankful|ne&s;s, that the great Head of the Church is pleas'd &s;till to rai&s;e up from among the Children of his People, for the Supply of His Churches, tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert &amp; maintain the&s;e Evangelical Principles; and that our Churches, (notwith|&s;tanding all their Degeneracies) have &s;till a high Value for &s;uch Principles, and for tho&s;e who publickly own and teach them.</P>
<P>And as we cannot but wi&s;h and pray that the <HI>College</HI> in the neighbouring Colony, (as well as our own,) may be a fruitful Mother of many &s;uch Sons as the Author, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven on the Care of their pre&s;ent worthy <HI>Rector;</HI> &s;o we heartily rejoyce in the &s;pecial Favour of Pro|vidence in be&s;towing &s;uch a rich Gift on the happy Church of <HI>Northampton,</HI> which has for &s;o many Lu&s;tres of Years flouri&s;hed under the Influence of &s;uch pious Doctrines, taught them in the excellent Mini&s;try of their late venerable Pa&s;tor, who&s;e Gifts &amp; Spirit, we hope will long live &amp; &s;hine in this his Grand&s;on, to the End that they may abound yet&punc; there in all the lovely fruits of Evangelical Humility and Thankfulne&s;s, to the Glory of GOD.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>1 COR. 1.29, 30, 31.</HI></BIBL>
<P>That no Fle&s;h &s;hould Glory in his Pre&s;ence. But of him are ye in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us Wi&s;dom, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Sanctifi|cation, and Redemption: That according as it is written, He that glorieth let him glory in the Lord.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THOSE Chri&s;tians to whom the Apo&s;tle directed this Epi&s;tle, dwelt in a Part of the World where human Wi&s;dom was in great Repute; as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in the 22. Ver&s;e of this Chap|ter, <HI>The Greeks &s;eek after Wi&s;dom. Corinth</HI> was not far from <HI>Athens,</HI> that had been for many Ages the mo&s;t famous Seat of Philo&s;ophy and Learning in the World.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle therefore ob&s;erves to them how that God by the Go&s;pel de&s;troyed, and <HI>brought to nought,</HI> their human Wi&s;dom. The Learned Gre|cians, and their great Philo&s;ophers, by all their Wi&s;dom did not know God, they were not able to find out the Truth in divine Things. But after they had done their utmo&s;t to no Effect, it
<PB N="2" REF="003415_0005_0FF838A02684DED0">
plea&s;ed God at length, to reveal him&s;elf by the Go&s;pel which they accounted Fooli&s;hne&s;s: He <HI>cho&s;e the fooli&s;h things of the World, to confound the wi&s;e, and the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and the ba&s;e things of the world, and things that are de&s;pi&s;ed, yea and things which are not; to bring to nought the things that are.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle informs them why he thus did, in the Ver&s;e of the Text, <HI>That no Fle&s;h &s;hould glo|ry in his Pre&s;ence</HI> &amp;c. &mdash;</P>
<P>In which Words may be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1. What God aims at in the Di&s;po&s;ition of things in the Affair of Redemption, viz. that Man &s;hould not glory in him&s;elf, but alone in God; <HI>That no Fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his Pre&s;ence, &mdash; that according as it is written he that glories let him glory in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. How this End is attained in the Work of Redemption, viz. by that ab&s;olute and immedi|ate Dependance which Men have upon God in that Work, for all their Good. Ina&s;much as,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> All the Good that they have is in and through Chri&s;t; He <HI>is made unto us Wi&s;dom, Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification, and Redemption.</HI> All the Good of the fallen and redeemed Creature is con|cerned in the&s;e four things, and can't be better di&s;tributed than into them; but Chri&s;t is each of them to us, and we have none of them any other|wi&s;e than in him. <HI>He is made of God unto us Wi&s;|dom</HI>: In him are all the proper Good, and true Excellency of the Under&s;tanding. Wi&s;dom was a thing that the Greeks admired; but Chri&s;t is the true Light of the World, 'tis through him alone that true Wi&s;dom is imparted to the Mind. 'Tis in and by Chri&s;t that we have <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>: 'Tis by being in him that we are ju&s;tified, have our
<PB N="3" REF="003415_0005_0FF838A02684DED0">
Sins pardoned, and are received as righteous into God's Favour. 'Tis by Chri&s;t that we have <HI>Sancti|fication</HI>: We have in him true Excellency of Heart, as well as of Under&s;tanding; and He is made un|to us inherent as well as imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s. 'Tis by Chri&s;t that we have <HI>Redemption,</HI> or the actual Deliverance from all Mi&s;ery, and the Be|&s;towment of all Happine&s;s and Glory. Thus we have all our Good by Chri&s;t who is God.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Another In&s;tance wherein our Depen|dance on God for all our Good appears, is this, That 'tis God that has given us Chri&s;t, that we might have the&s;e Benefits through him; he <HI>of God is made unto us Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> 'Tis <HI>of him</HI> that we are <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> and come to have an Intere&s;t in him, and &s;o do receive tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings which he is made unto us. 'Tis God that gives us Faith whereby we clo&s;e with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>So that in this Ver&s;e is &s;hewn our Dependance on each Per&s;on in the Trinity for all our Good. We are dependent on Chri&s;t the Son of God, as he is our <HI>Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification, and Redemption.</HI> We are dependent on the Father, who has given us Chri&s;t, &amp; made him to be the&s;e things to us. We are dependent on the Holy Gho&s;t, for 'tis <HI>of him that we are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI>; 'tis the Spirit of God that gives Faith in him, where|by we receive him, and clo&s;e with him.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> GOD is glorified in the Work of Redemp|tion in this, that there appears in it &s;o ab&s;olute and univer&s;al a Dependance of the Redeemed on him.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003415_0006_0FF838A2EA018A40">Here I propo&s;e to &s;hew, 1. That there is an ab&s;olute &amp; univer&s;al Dependance of the Redeem|ed on God for all their Good. And 2. That God hereby is exalted and glorified in the Work of Redemption.</P>
<P N="1">I. There is an ab&s;olute and univer&s;al Depen|dance of the Redeemed on God. The Nature and Contrivance of our Redemption is &s;uch, that the Redeemed are in every thing directly, imme|diately, and intirely dependent on God: They are dependent on him for all, and are dependent on him every Way.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Ways wherein the Dependance of one Being may be upon another for its Good, and wherein the Redeemed of Je&s;us Chri&s;t depend on God for all their Good, are the&s;e, viz. That they have all their Good <HI>of</HI> him, and that they have all <HI>through</HI> him, and that they have all <HI>in</HI> him: That he be the Cau&s;e and Original whence all their Good comes, therein it is <HI>of</HI> him; and that he be the Medium by which it is obtained and conveyed, therein they have it <HI>through</HI> him; and that he be that Good it &s;elf that is given and con|veyed, therein it is <HI>in</HI> him.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e that are redeemed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t do in all the&s;e Re&s;pects very directly and entirely depend on God for their all.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Redeemed have all their Good <HI>of</HI> God. God is the great Author of it; He is the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of it, and not only &s;o but he is the on|ly proper Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis <HI>of</HI> God that we have our Redeemer. 'Tis God that has provided a Saviour for us. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not only of God in his Per&s;on, as he is
<PB N="5" REF="003415_0006_0FF838A2EA018A40">
the only begotten Son of God; but he is from God as we are concerned in him, and in his Office of Mediator; He is the Gift of God to us: God cho&s;e and anointed him, appointed him his Work, and &s;ent him into the World.</P>
<P>And as it is God that gives, &s;o 'tis God that accepts the Saviour. As it is God that provides and gives the Redeemer to buy Salvation for us, &s;o it is <HI>of</HI> God that that Salvation is bought: He gives the Purcha&s;er, and he affords the thing pur|cha&s;ed.</P>
<P>'Tis of God that Chri&s;t becomes ours, that we are brought to him, and are united to him: 'Tis of God that we receive Faith to clo&s;e with him, that we may have an Intere&s;t in him. Eph. 2.8. <HI>For by Grace ye are &s;aved, through Faith; and that not of your &s;elves, it is the Gift of God.</HI> 'Tis of God that we actually do receive all the Benefits that Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed. 'Tis God that pardons and ju&s;tifies, and delivers from going down to Hell, and 'tis his Favour that the Redeemed are recei|ved into, and are made the Objects of, when they are ju&s;tified. So it is God that delivers from the Dominion of Sin, and clean&s;es us from our Filthi|ne&s;s, and changes us from our Deformity. 'Tis of God that the Redeemed do receive all their true Excellency, Wi&s;dom and Holine&s;s; and that two Ways, viz. as the Holy Gho&s;t by whom the&s;e things are immediately wrought is from God, pro|ceeds from him, and is &s;ent by him; and al&s;o as the Holy Gho&s;t him&s;elf is God, by who&s;e Opera|tion and Indwelling, the Knowledge of God and divine things, and a holy Di&s;po&s;ition, &amp; all Grace are confer'd and upheld.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003415_0007_0FF838A55F946578">And tho' Means are made U&s;e of in conferring Grace on Men's Souls, yet 'tis of God that we have the&s;e Means of Grace, and 'tis God that makes them effectual. 'Tis of God that we have the holy Scriptures; they are the Word of God. 'Tis of God that we have Ordinances, and their Efficacy depends on the immediate Influence of the Spirit of God. The Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are &s;ent of God, and all their Suffici|ency is of him. 2 Cor. 4.7. <HI>We have this Trea|&s;ure in earthen Ve&s;&s;els, that the Excellency of the Pow|er may be of God and not of us.</HI> Their Succe&s;s de|pends entirely and ab&s;olutely on the immediate Ble&s;&s;ing and Influence of God.</P>
<P>The Redeemed have all,</P>
<P N="1">1. Of the <HI>Grace</HI> of God. It was of meer Grace that God gave us his only begotten Son. The Grace is great in proportion to the Dignity and Excellency of what is given: The Gift was infi|nitely precious, becau&s;e it was of a Per&s;on infinite|ly worthy, a Per&s;on of infinite Glory: and al&s;o becau&s;e it was of a Per&s;on infinitely near and dear to God. The Grace is great in proportion to the Benefit we have given us in him: The Benefit is doubly infinite in that in him we have Deliver|ance from an infinite, becau&s;e an eternal Mi&s;ery, and do al&s;o receive eternal Joy and Glory. The Grace in be&s;towing this Gift is great in proportion to our Unworthine&s;s to whom it is given; in&s;tead of de&s;erving &s;uch a Gift, we merited infinitely ill of God's Hands. The Grace is great according to the Manner of giving, or in proportion to the Humiliation &amp; Expence of the Method &amp; Means by which Way is made for our having of the Gift. He gave him to us dwelling among&s;t us; he gave
<PB N="7" REF="003415_0007_0FF838A55F946578">
him to us incarnate, or in our own Nature; he gave him to us in our Nature, in the like Infirmi|ties, in which we have it in our fallen State, and which in us do accompany, and are occa&s;ion'd by, the &s;inful Corruption of our Nature. He gave him to us in a low and afflicted State; and not only &s;o but he gave him to us &s;lain that he might be a Fea&s;t for our Souls.</P>
<P>The Grace of God in be&s;towing this Gift is mo&s;t free. It was what God was under no Obligation to be&s;tow: He might have rejected fallen Man, as he did the fallen Angels. It was what we never did any thing to merit: 'Twas given while we were yet Enemies, and before we had &s;o much as repented. It was from the Love of God that &s;aw no Excellency in us to attract it; and it was with|out Expectation of ever being requited for it.</P>
<P>And 'tis from meer Grace that the Benefits of Chri&s;t are applied to &s;uch and &s;uch particular Per&s;ons. Tho&s;e that are called and &s;anctified are to attribute it alone to the good Plea&s;ure of God's Goodne&s;s, by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed. He is &s;overeign and hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardens.</P>
<P>Man hath now a greater Dependance on the Grace of God than he had before the Fall. He depends on the free Goodne&s;s of God for much more than he did then: Then he depended on God's Goodne&s;s for conferring the Reward of per|fect Obedience; for God was not obliged to pro|mi&s;e and be&s;tow that Reward: But now we are dependent on the Grace of God for much more: We &s;tand in need of Grace, not only to be&s;tow Glory upon us, but to deliver us from Hell and eternal Wrath. Under the fir&s;t Covenant we de|pended
<PB N="8" REF="003415_0008_0FF838A958EAD478">
on God's Goodne&s;s to give us the Reward of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and &s;o we do now. And not on|ly &s;o, but we &s;tand in need of God's free &amp; &s;ove|reign Grace to give us that Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and yet not only &s;o, but we &s;tand in need of his Grace to pardon our Sin, and relea&s;e us from the Guilt and infinite Demerit of it.</P>
<P>And as we are dependent on the Goodne&s;s of God for more now than under the fir&s;t Covenant, &s;o we are dependent on a much greater, more free and wonderful Goodne&s;s. We are now more dependent on God's arbitrary and &s;overeign good Plea&s;ure. We were in our fir&s;t E&s;tate de|pendent on God for Holine&s;s: We had our origi|nal Righteou&s;ne&s;s from him; but then Holine&s;s was not be&s;tow'd in &s;uch a Way of &s;overeign good Plea&s;ure as it is now. Man was created ho|ly, and it become God to create holy all the rea|&s;onable Creatures he created: It would have been a Di&s;paragement to the Holine&s;s of God's Nature, if he had made an intelligent Creature unholy. But now when Man is made holy, it is from meer and arbitrary Grace; God may for ever de|ny Holine&s;s to the fallen Creature if he plea&s;es, without any Di&s;paragement to any of his Per|fections.</P>
<P>And we are not only indeed more dependent on the Grace of God, but our Dependance is much more con&s;picuous, becau&s;e our own In&s;ufficiency and Helple&s;ne&s;s in our &s;elves is much more appa|rent, in our fallen and undone State, than it was before we were either &s;inful or mi&s;erable. We are more apparently dependent on God for Holi|ne&s;s, becau&s;e we are fir&s;t &s;inful, and utterly pol|luted, and afterward holy: So the Production of
<PB N="9" REF="003415_0008_0FF838A958EAD478">
the Effect is &s;en&s;ible, and its Derivation from God more obvious. If Man was ever holy and always was &s;o, it would not be &s;o apparent, that he had not Holine&s;s nece&s;&s;arily, as an in&s;eperable Qualification of human Nature. So we are more apparently dependent on free Grace for the Fa|vour of God, for we are fir&s;t ju&s;tly the Objects of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, and afterwards are received into Favour. We are more apparently dependent on God for Happine&s;s, being fir&s;t mi&s;erable, and af|terwards happy. 'Tis more apparently free and without Merit in us, becau&s;e we are actually with|out any kind of Excellency to merit, if there could be any &s;uch thing as Merit in Creature Excellen|cy. And we are not only without any true Ex|cellency, but are full of, and wholly defiled with, that which is infinitely odious. All our Good is more apparently from God, becau&s;e we are fir&s;t naked and wholly without any Good, and after|wards enriched with all Good.</P>
<P N="2">2. We receive all of the <HI>Power</HI> of God. Man's Redemption is often &s;poken of as a Work of won|derful Power as well as Grace. The great Pow|er of God appears in bringing a Sinner from his low State, from the depths of Sin and Mi&s;ery, to &s;uch an exalted State of Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s. Eph. 1.19. <HI>And what is the exceeding Greatne&s;s of his Power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty Power</HI> &mdash;.</P>
<P>We are dependent on God's Power through e|very Step of our Redemption. We are dependent on the Power of God to convert us, &amp; give Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &amp; the new Nature. 'Tis a Work of Creation: <HI>If any Man be in Chri&s;t he is a new Creature,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.17. <HI>We are created in Chri&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="003415_0009_0FF838AC593CDC78">
Je&s;us,</HI> Eph. 2.10. The fallen Creature can't at|tain to true Holine&s;s, but by being created again. Eph. 4.24. <HI>And that ye put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true Holi|ne&s;s.</HI> 'Tis a rai&s;ing from the Dead. Colo&s;. 2.12, 13. &mdash; <HI>Wherein al&s;o ye are ri&s;en with him, through the Faith of the Operation of God, who hath rai&s;ed him from the Dead.</HI> Yea, 'tis a more glorious Work of Power than meer Creation, or rai&s;ing a dead Body to Life, in that the Effect attained is greater and more excellent. That holy &amp; happy Being, and &s;piritual Life which is reach'd in the Work of Conver&s;ion, is a far greater, and more glorious Effect, than meer Being &amp; Life. And the State from whence the Change is made, of &s;uch a Death in Sin, and total Corruption of Nature, &amp; depth of Mi&s;ery, is far more remote from the State at|tained, than meer Death of Non-entity.</P>
<P>'Tis by God's Power al&s;o that we are pre&s;erved in a State of Grace. 1 Pet. 1.5. <HI>Who are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</HI> As Grace is at fir&s;t from God, &s;o 'tis continually from him, and is maintained by him, as much as Light in the Atmo&s;phere is all Day long from the Sun, as well as at fir&s;t Dawning, or at Sun-ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>Men are dependent on the Power of God, for every Exerci&s;e of Grace, and for carrying on the Work of Grace in the Heart, for the &s;ubduing of Sin and Corruption, &amp; increa&s;ing holy Principles, and enabling to bring forth Fruit in good Works, and at la&s;t bringing Grace to it's Perfection, in making the Soul compleatly amiable in Chri&s;t's glorious Likene&s;s, and filling of it with a &s;atisfy|ing Joy &amp; Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and for the rai&s;ing of the Body to Life, and to &s;uch a perfect State, that it

&s;hall be &s;uitable for an Habitation and Organ for a Soul &s;o perfected and ble&s;&s;ed. The&s;e are the mo&s;t glorious Effects of the Power of God, that are &s;een in the Series of God's Acts with Re|&s;pect to the Creatures.</P>
<P>Man was dependent on the Power of God in his fir&s;t E&s;tate, but he is more dependent on his Power now; he needs God's Power to do more things for him, and depends on a more wonder|ful Exerci&s;e of his Power. It was an Effect of the Power of God to make Man holy at the fir&s;t; but more remarkably &s;o now, becau&s;e there is a great deal of Oppo&s;ition and Difficulty in the Way. 'Tis a more glorious Effect of Power to make that holy that was &s;o depraved and under the Dominion of Sin, than to confer Holine&s;s on that which before had nothing of the contrary. 'Tis a more glorious Work of Power to re&s;cue a Soul out of the Hands of the Devil, and from the Powers of Darkne&s;s, and to bring it into a State of Salvation, than to confer Holine&s;s where there was no Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or Oppo&s;ition. Luke 11.21, 22. <HI>When a &s;trong Man armed keepeth his Palace his Goods are in Peace; but when a &s;tronger than he &s;hall come upon him and overcome him, he taketh from him all his Armour wherein he tru&s;ted and divideth his Spoils.</HI> So 'tis a more glorious Work of Power to uphold a Soul in a State of Grace and Holine&s;s, and to carry it on till it is brought to Glory, when there is &s;o much Sin re|maining in the Heart, re&s;i&s;ting, and Satan with all his Might oppo&s;ing, than it would have been to have kept Man from falling at fir&s;t, when Sa|tan had nothing in Man.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003415_0010_0FF838AE79612DB0">Thus we have &s;hewn how the Redeemed are dependent on God for all their Good as they have all <HI>of</HI> him.</P>
<P>Secondly, They are al&s;o dependent on God for all, as they have all <HI>through</HI> him. 'Tis God that is the Medium of it, as well as the Author and Fountain of it. All that we have, Wi&s;dom, and the Pardon of Sin, Deliverance from Hell, Acceptance into God's Favour, Grace and Holi|ne&s;s, true Comfort and Happine&s;s, eternal Life and Glory, we have from God by a Mediator; and this Mediator is God; which Mediator we have an ab&s;olute Dependance upon, as He <HI>through</HI> whom we receive all. So that here is another Way wherein we have our Dependance on God for all Good. God not only gives us the Mediator, and accepts his Mediation, and of his Power &amp; Grace be&s;tows the things purcha&s;ed by the Mediator, but he is the Mediator.</P>
<P>Our Ble&s;&s;ings are what we have by Purcha&s;e; and the Purcha&s;e is made of God, the Ble&s;&s;ings are purcha&s;ed of him, and God gives the Pur|cha&s;er; and not only &s;o but God is the Purcha&s;|er. Yea God is both the Purcha&s;er &amp; the Price; for Chri&s;t, who is God purcha&s;ed the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings for us, by offering up him&s;elf as the Price of our Salvation. He purcha&s;ed eternal Life by the Sa|crifice of him&s;elf. Heb. 7.27. <HI>He offered up him|&s;elf.</HI> And 9.26. <HI>He hath appeared to take away Sin by the Sacrifice of him&s;elf.</HI> Indeed it was the human Nature that was offer'd; but it was the &s;ame Per&s;on with the divine, and therefore was an infinite Price: it was looked upon as if God had been offered in Sacrifice.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003415_0010_0FF838AE79612DB0">As we thus have our Good <HI>through</HI> God, we have a Dependance on God in a Re&s;pect that Man in his fir&s;t E&s;tate had not. Man was to have eternal Life then through his own Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; &s;o that he had partly a Dependance upon what was in him&s;elf; for we have a De|pendance upon that <HI>through</HI> which we have our Good, as well as that <HI>from</HI> which we have it: and though Man's Righteou&s;ne&s;s that he then depended on was indeed from God, yet it was his own, it was inherent in him&s;elf; &s;o that his Dependance was not &s;o immediately on God. But now the Righteou&s;ne&s;s that we are Depen|dent on is not in our &s;elves, but in God. We are &s;aved through the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t: he <HI>is made unto us Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; and therefore is pro|phecied of, Jer. 23.6. under that Name of <HI>the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> In that the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s we are ju&s;tified by is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, it is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God. 2 Cor. 5.21. <HI>That we might be made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI></P>
<P>Thus in Redemption, we han't only all things <HI>of</HI> God, but <HI>by</HI> and <HI>through</HI> him, 1 Cor. 8.6. <HI>But to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom are all things, and we by him.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, The Redeemed have all their Good <HI>in</HI> God. We not only have it <HI>of</HI> him and <HI>through</HI> him, but it con&s;i&s;ts <HI>in</HI> him; he <HI>is</HI> all our Good.</P>
<P>The Good of the Redeemed is either objective or inherent. By their objective Good I mean, that extrin&s;ick Object, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and En|joyment of which they are happy. Their inhe|rent
<PB N="14" REF="003415_0011_0FF838B02FC44D50">
Good is that Excellency or Plea&s;ure which is in the Soul it &s;elf. With Re&s;pect to both of which the Redeemed have all their Good in God, or which is the &s;ame thing, God him&s;elf is all their Good.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Redeemed have all their <HI>objective</HI> Good in God. God him&s;elf is the great Good which they are brought to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Enjoy|ment of by Redemption. He is the highe&s;t Good, &amp; the Sum of all that Good which Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed. God is the Inheritance of the Saints; he is the Portion of their Souls. God is their Wealth and Trea&s;ure, their Food, their Life, their dwelling Place, their Ornament and Dia|dem, and their everla&s;ting Honour and Glory. They have none in Heaven but God; he is the great Good which the Redeemed are received to at Death, and which they are to ri&s;e to at the End of the World. The <HI>Lord God</HI> He is the Light of the heavenly Jeru&s;alem; and is the <HI>River of the Water of Life</HI> that runs, and <HI>the Tree of Life that grows, in the mid&s;t of the Paradi&s;e of God.</HI> The glorious Excellencies and Beauty of God will be what will for ever entertain the Minds of the Saints, and the Love of God will be their e|verla&s;ting Fea&s;t. The Redeemed will indeed en|joy other things; they will enjoy the Angels, and will enjoy one another: but that which they &s;hall enjoy in the Angels, or each other, or in a|ny thing el&s;e what&s;oever, that will yield them Delight and Happine&s;s, will be what will be &s;een of God in them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Redeemed have all their <HI>inherent</HI> Good in God. Inherent Good is twofold; 'tis either <HI>Excellency</HI> or <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI> The&s;e the Redeemed not

only derive from God, as cau&s;ed by him, but have them in him. They have &s;piritual Excel|lency and Joy by a kind of Participation of God. They are made excellent by a Communication of God's Excellency: God puts his own Beauty, i. e. his beautiful Likene&s;s upon their Souls: They are made <HI>Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> or moral Image of God, 2 Pet. 1.4. They are holy by being made Partakers of God's Ho|line&s;s, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.10. The Saints are beautiful and ble&s;&s;ed by a Communication of God's Holine&s;s and Joy as the Moon and Planets are bright by the Sun's Light. The Saint hath &s;piritual Joy and Plea&s;ure by a kind of Effu&s;ion of God on the Soul. In the&s;e things the Redeemed have Com|munion with God; that is, they partake with him and of him.</P>
<P>The Saints have both their &s;piritual Excellen|cy and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s by the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, or Spirit of God, and his Dwelling in them. They are not only cau&s;ed by the Holy Gho&s;t, but are in the Holy Gho&s;t as their Principle. The Holy Spirit becoming an Inhabitant, is a vital Principle in the Soul: He acting in, upon and with the Soul, becomes a Fountain of true Holi|ne&s;s and Joy, as a Spring is of Water, by the Ex|ertion and Diffu&s;ion of it &s;elf. John 4.14. <HI>But who&s;oever drinketh of the Water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never thir&s;t; but the Water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall be in him a Well of Water &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting Life.</HI> Compared with Chap. 7.38, 39. <HI>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath &s;aid, out of his Belly &s;hall flow Rivers of living Water; but this &s;pake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him &s;hould receive.</HI> The Sum of
<PB N="16" REF="003415_0012_0FF838B2B69CE948">
what Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed for us, is that Spring of Water &s;poken of in the former of tho&s;e Places, and tho&s;e Rivers of living Water &s;poken of in the latter. And the Sum of the Ble&s;&s;ings, which the Redeemed &s;hall receive in Heaven, is that <HI>River of Water of Life, that proceeds from the Throne of God and the Lamb,</HI> Rev. 22.1. Which doubtle&s;s &s;ignifies the &s;ame with tho&s;e <HI>Rivers of living Water,</HI> explain'd John 7.38, 39. which is el&s;ewhere called the <HI>River of God's Plea&s;ures.</HI> Herein con&s;i&s;ts the Fulne&s;s of Good, which the Saints receive of Chri&s;t. 'Tis by partaking of the Holy Spirit, that they have Communion with Chri&s;t in his Fulne&s;s. God hath given the Spirit, not by Mea&s;ure unto Him; and they do receive of his Fulne&s;s, and Grace for Grace. This is the Sum of the Saints Inheritance: and there|fore that little of the Holy Gho&s;t which Believ|ers have in this World, is &s;aid to be <HI>the Earne&s;t of their Inheritance,</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.22. <HI>Who hath al&s;o &s;ealed us, and given us the Spirit in our Hearts.</HI> And Ver. 5. <HI>Now he that hath wrought us for the &s;elf &s;ame thing is God, who al&s;o hath given unto us the Earne&s;t of the Spirit.</HI> And Eph. 1.13, 14. <HI>Ye were &s;ealed with that Holy Spirit of Promi&s;e, which is the Earne&s;t of our Inheritance, until the Redemp|tion of the purcha&s;ed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> and <HI>Good Things</HI> are &s;poken of in Scripture as the &s;ame; as if the Spirit of God communicated to the Soul, comprized all good Things, Mat. 7.11. <HI>How much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give good Things to them that ask him.</HI> In <HI>Luke</HI> it is, Chap. 11.11. <HI>How much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</HI> This is the Sum of the
<PB N="17" REF="003415_0012_0FF838B2B69CE948">
Ble&s;&s;ings that Chri&s;t died to procure, and that are the Subject of Go&s;pel-Promi&s;es. Gal. 3.13, 14. <HI>He was made a Cur&s;e for us, that we might receive the Promi&s;e of the Spirit through Faith.</HI> The Spirit of God is the great Promi&s;e of the Father, Luke 24.49. <HI>Behold I &s;end the Promi&s;e of my Father up|on you.</HI> The Spirit of God therefore is called <HI>the Spirit of Promi&s;e</HI>; Eph. 1.13. This Pro|mi&s;ed Thing Chri&s;t received, and had given into his Hand, as &s;oon as he had fini&s;hed the Work of our Redemption, to be&s;tow on all that he had redeemed; Acts 2.33. <HI>Therefore be|ing by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the Promi&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t, he hath &s;hed forth this, which ye both &s;ee and hear.</HI> So that all the Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s of the Redeemed is <HI>in</HI> God. 'Tis in the Communicati|ons, indwelling and acting of the Spirit of God. Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s is in the Fruit, here and hereafter, becau&s;e <HI>God dwells in</HI> them, <HI>and they in God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus 'tis God that has given us the Redeemer, and 'tis of him that our Good is purcha&s;ed: So 'tis God that is the Redeemer, and the Price: and 'tis God al&s;o that is the Good purcha&s;ed. So that all that we have is <HI>of</HI> God, and <HI>through</HI> him, and <HI>in</HI> him, Rom. 11.36. <HI>For</HI> of <HI>him, and</HI> through <HI>him, and to him,</HI> or <HI>in him</HI> are all things: The &s;ame in the Greek, that is here rendred <HI>to him,</HI> is render'd <HI>in him,</HI> 1 Cor. 8.6.</P>
<P N="2">II. God is glorified in the Work of Redemp|tion by this Means, viz. By there being &s;o great and univer&s;al a Dependance of the Redeemed on him.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="18" REF="003415_0013_0FF838B547130CE8">1. Man hath &s;o much the greater Occa&s;ion and Obligation to take notice and acknowledge God's Perfections and All-&s;ufficiency. The greater the Creatures Dependance is on God's Perfections, and the greater Concern he has with them, &s;o much the greater Occa&s;ion has he to take notice of them. So much the greater Concern any one has with and Dependance up|on the Power and Grace of God, &s;o much the greater Occa&s;ion has he to take notice of that Power and Grace. So much the greater and more immediate Dependance there is on the di|vine Holine&s;s, &s;o much the greater Occa&s;ion to take notice of and acknowledge that. So much the greater and more ab&s;olute Dependance we have on the divine Perfections, as belonging to the &s;everal Per&s;ons of the Trinity, &s;o much the greater Occa&s;ion have we to ob&s;erve and own the divine Glory of each of them. That which we are mo&s;t concerned with, is &s;urely mo&s;t in the Way of our Ob&s;ervation and Notice; and this kind of Concern with any thing, viz. De|pendance, does e&s;pecially tend to commend and oblige the Attention and Ob&s;ervation. Tho&s;e Things that we are not much Dependent upon, 'tis ea&s;y to neglect; but we can &s;carce do any other than mind that which we have a great Dependance on. By Rea&s;on of our &s;o great De|pendance on God, and his Perfections, and in &s;o many Re&s;pects; He and his Glory are the more directly &s;et in our View, which Way &s;o|ever we turn our Eyes.</P>
<P>We have the greater Occa&s;ion to take notice of God's All-&s;ufficiency, when all our Sufficien|cy is thus every Way of him. We have the
<PB N="19" REF="003415_0013_0FF838B547130CE8">
more Occa&s;ion to contemplate him as an infinite Good, and as the Fountain of all Good. Such a Dependance on God <HI>demon&s;trates</HI> God's All-&s;uffi|ciency. So much as the Dependance of the Creature is on God, &s;o much the greater does the Creatures Emptine&s;s in him&s;elf appear to be: and &s;o much the greater the Creatures Emptine&s;s, &s;o much the greater mu&s;t the Fulne&s;s of the Be|ing be, who &s;upplies him. Our having all <HI>of</HI> God, &s;hews the Fulne&s;s of his Power and Grace: Our having all <HI>through</HI> him, &s;hews the Fulne&s;s of his Merit and Worthine&s;s; and our having all <HI>in</HI> him demon&s;trates his Fulne&s;s of Beauty, Love and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And the Redeemed by Rea&s;on of the Great|ne&s;s of their Dependance on God, han't only &s;o much the greater Occa&s;ion, but Obligation to contemplate and acknowledge the Glory and Fulne&s;s of God. How unrea&s;onable &amp; ungrate|ful &s;hould we be, if we did not acknowledge that Sufficiency and Glory, that we do ab&s;olutely, immediately and univer&s;ally depend upon?</P>
<P N="2">2. Hereby is demon&s;trated how great God's Glory is con&s;idered comparatively, or as compa|red with the Creatures. By the Creatures being thus wholly and univer&s;ally dependent on God, it appears that the Creature is nothing, and that God is all. Hereby it appears that God is infi|nitely above us; that God's Strength, and Wi&s;|dom, and Holine&s;s are infinitely greater than ours. However great and glorious the Creature apprehends God to be, yet if he be not &s;en&s;ible of the difference between God and him, &s;o as to &s;ee that God's Glory is great compared with his
<PB N="20" REF="003415_0014_0FF838B7DD5AF420">
own, he will not be di&s;po&s;ed to give God the Glory due to his Name. If the Creature in any Re&s;pects &s;ets him&s;elf upon a Level with God, or exalts him&s;elf to any Competition with him, however he may apprehend that great Honour and profound Re&s;pect may belong to God from tho&s;e that are more inferiour, and at a greater Di&s;tance, will not be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of it's being due from him. So much the more Men exalt them|&s;elves, &s;o much the le&s;s will they &s;urely be di&s;|po&s;ed to exalt God. 'Tis certainly a Thing that God aims at in the Di&s;po&s;ition of Things in the Affair of Redemption, (if we allow the Scriptures to be a Revelation of God's Mind) that God &s;hould appear full, and Man in him&s;elf empty, that God &s;hould appear all, and Man no|thing. 'Tis God's declared De&s;ign that others &s;hould not <HI>glory in his Pre&s;ence,</HI> which implies that 'tis his De&s;ign to advance his own compa|rative Glory. So much the more Man <HI>glories in God's Pre&s;ence,</HI> &s;o much the le&s;s Glory is a&s;crib|ed to God.</P>
<P N="3">3. By it's being thus ordered, that the Crea|ture &s;hould have &s;o ab&s;olute and univer&s;al a De|pendance on God, Provi&s;ion is made that God &s;hould have our whole Souls, and &s;hould be the Object of our undivided Re&s;pect. If we had our Dependance partly on God, and partly on &s;omething el&s;e, Man's Re&s;pect would be divided to tho&s;e different Things on which he had De|pendance. Thus it would be if we depended on God only for a Part of our Good, and on our &s;elves, or &s;ome other Being, for another Part; Or if we had our Good only <HI>from</HI> God, and
<PB N="21" REF="003415_0014_0FF838B7DD5AF420">
<HI>through</HI> another that was not God, and <HI>in</HI> &s;ome|thing el&s;e di&s;tinct from both, our Hearts would be divided between the Good it &s;elf, and him <HI>from</HI> whom, and him <HI>through</HI> whom we received it. But now there is no Occa&s;ion for this, God being not only he <HI>from</HI> or <HI>of</HI> whom we have all Good, but al&s;o <HI>through</HI> whom, and one that is that Good it &s;elf, that we have from him, and through him. So that what&s;oever there is to at|tract our Re&s;pect, the Tendency is &s;till directly towards God, all unites in him as the Center.</P>

<P N="1">1. We may here ob&s;erve the marvellous Wi&s;|dom of God, in the Work of Redemption. God hath made Man's Emptine&s;s and Mi&s;ery, his low, lo&s;t and ruin'd State into which he is &s;unk by the Fall, an Occa&s;ion of the greater Advance|ment of his own Glory, as in other Ways &s;o par|ticularly in this, that there is now a much more univer&s;al and apparent Dependance of Man on God. Though God be plea&s;ed to lift Man out of that di&s;mal Aby&s;s of Sin and Woe into which he was fallen, and exceedingly to exalt him in Excellency and Honour, and to an high Pitch of Glory and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, yet the Creature hath nothing in any Re&s;pect to glory of; all the Glo|ry evidently belongs to God, all is in a meer, and mo&s;t ab&s;olute and divine Dependance on the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>And each Per&s;on of the Trinity is equally glo|rified in this Work: There is an ab&s;olute De|pendance of the Creature on every one for all: All is <HI>of</HI> the Father, all <HI>through</HI> the Son, and all

<HI>in</HI> the Holy Gho&s;t. Thus God appears in the Work of Redemption, as <HI>all in all.</HI> 'Tis fit that he that <HI>is, and there is none el&s;e,</HI> &s;hould be the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, the all and the only, in this Work.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence tho&s;e Doctrines and Schemes of Di|vinity that are in any Re&s;pect oppo&s;ite to &s;uch an ab&s;olute, &amp; univer&s;al Dependance on God, do derogate from God's Glory, and thwart the De|&s;ign of the Contrivance for our Redemption. Tho&s;e Schemes that put the Creature in God's &s;tead, in any of the mentioned Re&s;pects, that exalt Man into the Place of either Father, Son, or Holy Gho&s;t, in any thing pertaining to our Redemption; that however they may allow of a Dependance of the Redeemed on God, yet de|ny a Dependance that is &s;o ab&s;olute and univer|&s;al; that own an intire Dependance on God for &s;ome things, but not for others; that own that we depend on God for the Gift and Acceptance of a Redeemer, but deny &s;o ab&s;olute a Depen|dance on him for the obtaining of an Intere&s;t in the Redeemer; that own an ab&s;olute Depen|dance on the Father for giving his Son, and on the Son for working out Redemption, but not &s;o entire a Dependance on the Holy Gho&s;t for Con|ver&s;ion, &amp; a being in Chri&s;t, &amp; &s;o coming to a 'Title to his Benefits; that own a Dependance on God for means of Grace, but not ab&s;olutely for the Benefit and Succe&s;s of tho&s;e Means; that own a partial Dependance on the Power of God, for the obtaining &amp; exerci&s;ing Holine&s;s, but not a meer Dependance on the arbitrary &amp; &s;overeign Grace of God; that own a Dependance on the

<P N="3">3. Hence we may learn a Rea&s;on why Faith is that by which we come to have an Intere&s;t in this Redemption; for there is included in the Nature of Faith, a Sen&s;iblene&s;s, and Acknow|ledgement of this ab&s;olute Dependence on God in this Affair. 'Tis very fit that it &s;hould be re|quired of all, in order to their having the Bene|fit of this Redemption, that they &s;hould be &s;en&s;i|ble of, &amp; acknowledge the Dependance on God for it. 'Tis by this Means that God hath con|trived to glorify him&s;elf in Redemption, &amp; 'tis fit that God &s;hould at lea&s;t have this Glory of tho&s;e that are the Subjects of this Redemption; and have the Benefit of it.</P>
<P>Faith is a Sen&s;iblene&s;s of what is real in the Work of Redemption; &amp; as we do really whol|ly depend on God, &s;o the Soul that believes doth entirely depend on God for all Salvation, in its own Sen&s;e, &amp; Act. Faith aba&s;es Men, &amp; exalts

I is nece&s;&s;ary in order to &s;aving Faith, that Man &s;hould be emptied of him&s;elf, that he &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible that he is <HI>wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</HI> Hu|mility is a great Ingredient&punc; of true Faith: He that truly receives Redemption receives it <HI>as a little Child,</HI> Mark 10.15. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall not re|ceive the Kingdom of Heaven as a little Child, he &s;hall not enter therein.</HI> 'Tis the Delight of a be|lieving Soul to aba&s;e it &s;elf and exalt God alone: that is the Language of it, P&s;al. 115.1. <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord, but to thy Name give Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Let us be exhorted to exalt God alone, and a&s;cribe to him all the Glory of Redemption. Let us endeavour to obtain, and increa&s;e in, a Sen&s;i|blene&s;s of our great Dependance on God, to have our Eye to him alone, to mortify a &s;elf-dependent, and &s;elf-righteous Di&s;po&s;ition. Man is naturally exceeding Prone to be exalting him|&s;elf, and depending on his own Power or Good|ne&s;s, as tho' he were he from whom he mu&s;t expect Happine&s;s, and to have Re&s;pect to En|joyments aliene from God and his Spirit, as tho&s;e in which Happine&s;s is to be found.</P>
<P>And this Doctrine &s;hould teach us to exalt God alone as by Tru&s;t &amp; Reliance, &s;o by Prai&s;e. <HI>Let him that glories glory in the Lord.</HI> Hath any Man Hope that he is converted, and &s;anctified, and that his Mind is endowed with true Excel|lency and &s;piritual Beauty, and his Sins forgiven, and he received into God's Favour, and exalted to the Honour and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of being his

Child, and an Heir of eternal Life; let him give God all the Glory; who alone makes him to differ from the wor&s;t of Men in this World, or the Mi&s;erable&s;t of the damned in Hell. Hath any Man much Comfort &amp; &s;trong Hope of eternal Life, let not his Hope lift him up, but di&s;po&s;e him the more to aba&s;e him&s;elf, and reflect on his own exceeding Unworthine&s;s of &s;uch a Favour, and to exalt God alone. Is any Man eminent in Holine&s;s, and abundant in good Words, let him take nothing of the Glory of it to him&s;elf, but a&s;cribe it to him who&s;e <HI>Workman|&s;hip we are, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto Good Works.</HI></P>
