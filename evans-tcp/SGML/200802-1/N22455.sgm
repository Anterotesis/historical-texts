<BIBL>2 SAMUEL XII. 5.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And</HI> David'<HI>s anger was greatly kindled again&s;t the man; and he &s;aid to</HI> Nathan, <HI>As the</HI> LORD <HI>liveth, the man that hath done this thing &s;hall &s;urely die.</HI></Q>

<P>UNWARY and vindictive monarch! He clearly &s;ees, in its full magnitude, the mote that blemi&s;hes another's eye, while, at the &s;ame time, without his &s;eeming to be &s;en&s;ible of it, a beam is in his own eye.</P>
<P>And we are his legitimate children. The blood of this royal di&s;pen&s;er of ju&s;tice flows in our veins. <HI>We</HI> &s;entence the Algerines, as <HI>he</HI> that villainous &s;heep-&s;teal|er. We want only the <HI>power,</HI> and they would expe|rience a mo&s;t exemplary cha&s;ti&s;ement; and, if &s;ome could be gratified, would be cra&s;ed from the catalogue of nations.</P>
<P>Prepare your ears to hear a mo&s;t extraordinary anath|ema, pronounced again&s;t that infatuated people by one of our fir&s;t poets and eminent &s;tate&s;men.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Great maledictions of eternal wrath,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which like heaven's vialed vengeance &s;inge and &s;cathe!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Transfix with &s;corpion &s;tings their callous heart,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Make blood-&s;hot eye-balls from their &s;ockets &s;tart,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For balm pour brim&s;tone in their wounded &s;oul,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then ope perdition and ingulph the whole!</HI></L></Q>
<P>In the name of horrour, why this raving and execra|tion! O, the Algerines have captured and en&s;laved five or &s;ix &s;core of Americans, and keep them in ab|ject &s;ervitude and di&s;tre&s;s. For this they are condem|ned to death and perdition; and I know not but heaven &s;ugge&s;ted the verdict.</P>
<P>But if this thing mu&s;t be done in the green tree, what &s;hall be done in the dry? In the&s;e United States, not five or &s;ix &s;core, but five or &s;ix hundred thou&s;and
<PB N="4" REF="029669_0003_0FE217BEE1A75B40">
per&s;ons, are en&s;laved;&mdash;not captured, like tho&s;e Amer|icans, upon the high &s;eas, where no one goes unappri|zed of the danger; but dragged defencele&s;s from their native fields; and frequently treated, as might ea|&s;ily be made to appear, in a manner barbarous as our people are treated at Algiers.</P>
<P>In Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts the negroes were freed long ago. In New-Hamp&s;hire and Vermont, they are few in num|ber; but <HI>&s;ome</HI> were found, at the taking of the la&s;t cen|&s;us, to be &s;till in &s;lavery even here. They might in|deed be free, did they know how to avail them&s;elves of the bill of rights, which declares, that all men are born equally free. But to our di&s;grace, they are and ought to be con&s;idered as &s;laves, till government &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">l take effectual mea&s;ures, as their guardians, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that they are in fact free; and till, for the &s;ake of ex|ample, their freedom &s;hall be made known to the world.</P>
<P>What if &s;ome &s;tates have pa&s;&s;ed acts of non-impor|tation? That, &s;o far as re&s;pects the negroes now in &s;lavery, is ju&s;t nothing at all. How will the non-im|portation of others repair the wrong done to the&s;e? Or, if no wrong is done, why &s;hould importation be &s;topped? Tho&s;e who are now &s;laves may pray, it is true, like the rich man in hell, that none of their brethren may be brought to this place of torment; but their prayers would avail but little, if granted, in mitigation of their own tortures.</P>
<P>The inju&s;tice of en&s;laving our fellow-creatures, even though they are black, is pretty generally acknowledg|ed; and in re&s;pect to <HI>our</HI> &s;laves, people affect to lament their misfortune in being brought into a &s;ituation, which renders it <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> that they &s;hould be conti|nued in bondage. It is ju&s;t, no doubt, that the negroes &s;hould have remained free; but they are &s;laves, and therefore let them continue &s;o. Let them, however, have this con&s;olation, that we will leave off our inju&s;|tice gradually. There &s;hall be an abolition; but it &s;hall begin moderately, and proceed lei&s;urely, and be completed &s;ometime or never. Thus the poor &s;lave may comfort him&s;elf, that at &s;ome di&s;tant period, <HI>when</HI> GOD only knows, he, or his children, or his children's children, may hope for deliverance.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="029669_0004_0FE217C06BE7F5B0">
Some are for &s;etting them free immediately. They are not for continuing an abu&s;e of the mo&s;t cruel na|ture, under any pretext whatever. And why are not all of this opinion? It is becau&s;e many are prejudiced, and many are indolent, and very many are intere&s;ted; not to mention, that mo&s;t people pay but very little attention to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Hence it has happened, that every advocate for an immediate emancipation has been immediately &s;ilen|ced by &s;ome &s;pecious objection. The indolent have by this means &s;ound repo&s;e for their con&s;ciences; and the intere&s;ted have rid them&s;elves of much odium, without any great danger of lo&s;ing their va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is plead, that &s;laves are <HI>property.</HI> "The operation (&s;aid Mr. Madi&s;on in Congre&s;s) of <HI>redu|cing the number of &s;laves</HI> was going on as quickly as po&s;|&s;ible. The mention of &s;uch a thing in the hou&s;e had in the mean time <HI>a very bad effect on that &s;pecies of pro|perty.</HI>"</P>
<P>Secondly, without negro &s;laves the &s;outhern planta|tions can not be managed to advantage.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the mo&s;t plau&s;ible and confounding plea of the whole is, that if they were all at once and imme|diately &s;et at liberty, to run at large, they would be a dangerous parcel of vagabonds, more unhappy them|&s;elves than at pre&s;ent, and the terrour and vexation of the community.</P>
<P>O, it is doubtle&s;s cruel, to deprive a ma&s;ter of the &s;lave for whom he paid perhaps forty guineas, and has had his labour for not more than forty years. But to whom did he pay the guineas? In the name of con&s;cience, who had any right, in the fir&s;t place, to &s;ell negroes? If a &s;hipload of Frenchmen were offered for &s;ale, the enquiry would quickly be made. The princi|ple would &s;oon be e&s;tabli&s;hed, that man could not be made the property of man.</P>
<P>But we our&s;elves are too &s;ecure to <HI>imagine</HI> the ca&s;e our own; otherwi&s;e we might appeal to that eternal rule of right, to do by others as they &s;hould do by us. And with what feeling &s;hould <HI>we</HI> &s;tand forth for &s;ale, be &s;laves, be called <HI>that &s;pecies of property;</HI> we, who deni|ed our parent country the right of taxing us, and edg|ed
<PB N="6" REF="029669_0005_0FE217C75370CA98">
our &s;words to maintain our liberty, or to die! Should we endure the oppre&s;&s;or's rod?</P>
<P>Money has been paid by the purcha&s;er; but no e|quivalent has been given or can be given to the negro. Liberty can not be e&s;timated by guineas. If &s;o, have I no claim to my liberty, becau&s;e a tyrant, &s;tronger than I, has robbed me of it, and &s;old me? This &s;pecies of property, upon that principle, is not &s;o highly privi|leged as other &s;pecies; for the laws take care, that &s;to|len goods, though purcha&s;ed by an hone&s;t man at their full value, &s;hall be given up to the right owner; and &s;hall they tolerate &s;lavery?</P>
<P>But if there &s;eems inju&s;tice, that individuals &s;hould wholly lo&s;e the labour of tho&s;e for whom they have paid &s;o much money; let the &s;tate under the countenance of which they have carried on this accur&s;ed traffic, make them &s;ome con&s;ideration, and let every one who has acquie&s;ced in the &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery contribute to its abolition.</P>
<P>Yet every ma&s;ter is holden by every tie, whatever government may &s;ee cau&s;e to do or not to do, to grant manumi&s;&s;ion to his &s;laves; and woe to the man who takes advantage of any human in&s;titution, to injure his fellow creatures, when his con&s;cience te&s;tifies that it <HI>is</HI> an injury, and that the law is cruel, and repugnant to all right.</P>
<P>A regular importation of negro &s;laves into America took place in con&s;equence of a &s;ugge&s;tion of Ca&s;as, a Spani&s;h clergyman. When the Spaniards conquered Hi&s;paniola, they reduced the Indians to &s;ervitude, and treated them with &s;uch cruelty, that multitudes peri&s;h|ed. Ca&s;as &s;trove to relieve them; but failed in every mea&s;ure. At la&s;t he propo&s;ed the importing of ne|groes; in order, by en&s;laving them, to free the Indians. So blind is man!</P>
<P>The &s;econd objection in my enumeration is no more an argument in favour of continuing what negroes in &s;lavery we already po&s;&s;e&s;s, than of importing new ones. But experiments have proved, in different parts of the world, that freemen will do more labour than &s;laves. Be&s;ides the objection is too iniquitous to be harboured a moment; and I have been pained at hearing it urged
<PB N="7" REF="029669_0006_0FE217C9E0A31E28">
by &s;ome, who &s;eem in other in&s;tances to be philan|thropic.</P>
<P>The third objection pretends kindne&s;s to the ne|groes, and a regard to our own &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>It is quite fa&s;hionable to ob&s;erve, under colour of the former principle, that freed negroes generally go more meanly dre&s;&s;ed than &s;laves. What then! Is freedom to be &s;old for a fine coat, for calicoes? And what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome &s;laves fare better than we? Who would be even a &s;ycophant, much le&s;s a &s;lave, for the &s;ake of better fare?</P>
<P>But the ob&s;ervation, made as a general one, is fal&s;e. The bulk of &s;laves in the &s;outhern &s;tates can not be more naked, and ill-u&s;ed, and defencele&s;s, than they are now. Soul and body would &s;eparate. And even if freedom &s;hould be the occa&s;ion of their being &s;till more de&s;ti|tute, and it were po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould yet continue to live; would they not likewi&s;e, on the other hand, get clear of ince&s;&s;ant drudgery, of di&s;piriting menaces, of mercile&s;s flagellations? What they would lo&s;e in dre&s;s and diet they would &s;ave in &s;weat and blood.</P>
<P>And do tho&s;e who live wor&s;e with freedom than when &s;laves, if there are &s;uch, do they commonly re|turn to their <HI>cidevant</HI> ma&s;ters, and &s;ay, I had rather be your &s;lave than be free? Such a thing may &s;ometimes happen; but if it were a general practice, where would be the hazard of &s;etting them in general free? It would only be lo&s;ing their labour, while they could make a little experiment, and then return to their abject con|dition, more ob&s;equious than before.</P>
<P>The truth is, liberty is &s;weet, and &s;lavery is horrible; and nothing can be an equivalent for the one, and nothing but in&s;en&s;ibility or a hope of deliverance can render the other &s;upportable.</P>
<P>The principle we are now examining talks of kind|ne&s;s. It would keep the negroes in &s;lavery for their own good, A very &s;u&s;picious &s;ort of humanity! Why not re-en&s;lave tho&s;e who have been once freed? Why not import more? Or do they live better in Congo, than tho&s;e happy wretches who have had the good for|tune to become &s;laves? Why not &s;ubjugate the Indians to this enviable condition; or rai&s;e the few indigent
<PB N="8" REF="029669_0007_0FE217CB6AECE058">
of our own nation to the rank of bondmen? Why does this benevolent &s;y&s;tem embrace only negroes now in &s;lavery? Perhaps we are under peculiar obligations, to regard their good. Yes, GOD knows it, and I wi&s;h we may be wi&s;e enough to di&s;charge the&s;e obligations in due &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>But this preten&s;ion of kindne&s;s is only a cloak. The other part of the objection is all that creates any difficulty. <HI>That</HI> I confe&s;s is of great importance, and merits a wi&s;e and candid di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We are in this dilemma: there is &s;uch a number of &s;laves in the country:&mdash;and, on the one hand, we can not continue them in bondage without doing vio|lence to our con&s;ciences, and incurring the di&s;|plea&s;ure of heaven; nor, on the other, can we free them without extraordinary mea&s;ures. It will require money, and labour, and wi&s;dom, and vigilance. Of two evils, if the latter can be degraded to &s;uch a name, we have to determine which is the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>There is no rea&s;on to expect, but that, if &s;o many myriads of wretches were turned out of doors, de&s;ti|tute, to live as they li&s;t, uncultivated as they now are, they would be a nui&s;ance in &s;ociety. Probably, be&s;ides idlene&s;s and beggary, we &s;hould &s;ee uncomfortable di&s;|orders, perhaps outrages, perhaps fatal crimes; &s;ome through ignorance, &s;ome through wantonne&s;s, &s;ome from impelling hunger, and &s;ome from revenge. They are not fit to be their own guides; they have been habituated, not to rea&s;on, but obey; their wills have been cru&s;hed; they are &s;carce con&s;cious of the power of willing; and, what is wor&s;e, they are not taught the duties that ari&s;e from &s;ocial relations, nor di&s;ciplined to good morals.</P>
<P>What then can be done? This is the momentous que&s;tion. But whenever we are as &s;incerely de&s;irous of freeing the negroes as we are of aggrandizing our own nation, we &s;hall &s;oon devi&s;e ways and means &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e. We, who de&s;cant upon the rights of man, who boa&s;t our improvements, our re&s;ources, our enterprize, our energy, our patriots, our territory, and, in fine, our "a&s;ylum for the unfortunate of other coun|tries";&mdash;we, the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing nation on the globe,
<PB N="9" REF="029669_0008_0FE217CDDBA57FD8">
if our hearts were engaged, &s;hould a&s;k for no foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to liberate our &s;laves.</P>
<P>But the que&s;tion &s;tills recurs, What can be done? The an&s;wer is, If they are not fit for freedom, they mu&s;t be fitted. They mu&s;t be con&s;idered, for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me, as in a &s;tate of minority&punc; It mu&s;t be a &s;tate of dependence and di&s;cipline, not &s;ervitude. They mu&s;t therefore be taken away from their ma&s;ters, and, by direction of the magi&s;trate, put under temporary guardians, governours, and in&s;tructors, to be educated, to be made acquainted with their rights and duties, and &s;ome hone&s;t method of acquiring a livelihood; to be prepared for citizen|&s;hip.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay, that all &s;hould be treated alike. I do not know, but <HI>&s;ome</HI> &s;hould be returned to Africa. Many are worn out with age and &s;ore travail. They mu&s;t not be ca&s;t helple&s;s into the high ways; but let them hear the glad news of liberty to the captive, that tears of tran&s;port may run down the furrows which have been deep-worn by tears of affliction. Does his ma&s;ter a&s;k, how he &s;hall live&mdash;who will &s;upport him? Live, wretch! how long have you revelled upon the fruit of his labours, ungratefully; and do you a&s;k, how he &s;hall live, how he &s;hall be &s;upported through the painful re&s;idue of a devoted life? Give him food from you own table, and beg him to pray for your a|varicious &s;oul.</P>
<P>After all, &s;ome may choo&s;e, though under no ina|bility or bias, to remain with their ma&s;ters. But, in this ca&s;e, government ought to con&s;ider, whether it is not their duty, to interfere &s;o far, as to &s;ee, that, if any remain, they do not remain <HI>&s;laves:</HI> and that, like other free per&s;ons, they can go whenever they plea&s;e, accord|ing to the e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of reciprocal contract. In &s;hort, they ought to have guardians.</P>
<P>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts gave a noble example; but, had they fallen upon the plan of carrying their negroes through &s;uch a preparation &s;tate before manumi&s;&s;ion, they would, I firmly believe, have found i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;alutary mea|&s;ure, and have been celebrated for teaching the world a new le&s;&s;on of humanity.</P>
