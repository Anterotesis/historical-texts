<P>THE Editor of this publication hopes, from the e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation of the &s;everal tracts of which it is compo&s;ed, that it will be found a more complete &s;y&s;tem for the in&s;truction of the female world, than perhaps any other extant.</P>

To this volume, the Editor has added Mi&s;s More's e&s;&s;ays&mdash;Mrs. Chapone's letter on the government of the temper&mdash; and Swift's letter to a young lady newly married. The&s;e have con&s;iderably enhanced its value&mdash;and he doubts not, the ladies on this &s;ide the Atlantic will be as generous in their encouragement of a work intended for their advantage, as tho&s;e in England and Ireland have been.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with the utmo&s;t diffidence that the following pages are &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of the pub|lic: yet, however the limited abilities of the author may have prevented her from &s;ucceeding to her wi&s;h, in the execution of her pre&s;ent attempt, &s;he humbly tru&s;ts that the uprightne&s;s of her intention will procure it a candid and favourable reception. The&s;e little e&s;&s;ays are chiefly calculated for the younger part of her own &s;ex, who, &s;he flatters her|&s;elf, will not e&s;teem them the le&s;s, becau&s;e they were written immediately for their &s;ervice. She by no means pretends to have compo&s;ed a regular &s;y&s;tem of morals, or a fini&s;hed plan of conduct: &s;he has only endeavoured to make a few remarks on &s;uch circum&s;tances as &s;eemed to her &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;ome improvement, and on &s;uch &s;ubjects as &s;he imagined were particularly intere&s;ting to young ladies, on their fir&s;t introduction into the world. She hopes they will not be offended, if &s;he has occa&s;ionally pointed out certain qualities, and &s;ugge&s;ted certain tempers and di&s;po&s;itions, as <HI>peculiarly feminine,</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="024452_0004_0FC7451202CF40E8">
hazarded &s;ome ob&s;ervations, which naturally aro&s;e from the &s;ubject, on the different characters which mark the &s;exes. And here again &s;he takes the liber|ty to repeat that the&s;e di&s;tinctions cannot be too nicely maintained; for be&s;ides tho&s;e important qua|lities common to both, each &s;ex has its re&s;pective, appropriated qualifications, which would cea&s;e to be meritorious, the in&s;tant they cea&s;ed to be appro|priated. Nature, propriety, and cu&s;tom have pre|&s;cribed certain bounds to each; bounds which the prudent and the candid will never attempt to break down; and indeed it would be highly impolitic to annihilate di&s;tinctions from which each acquires excellence, and to attempt innovations by which both would be lo&s;ers.</P>
<P>Women, therefore, never under&s;tand their own intere&s;ts &s;o little, as when they affect tho&s;e quali|ties and accompli&s;hments, from the want of which they derive their highe&s;t merit. "The <HI>porcelain</HI> clay of human kind," &s;ays an admired writer, &s;peak|ing of the &s;ex. Greater delicacy evidently implies greater fragility; and this weakne&s;s, natural and moral, clearly points out the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;uperior degree of caution, retirement, and re&s;erve.</P>
<P>If the author may be allowed to keep up the allu|&s;ion of the poet ju&s;t quoted, &s;he would a&s;k, if we do not put the fine&s;t va&s;es, and the co&s;tlie&s;t images in places of the greate&s;t &s;ecurity, and mo&s;t remote from any probability of accident or de&s;truction? By be|ing &s;o &s;ituated, they find their protection in their weakne&s;s, and their &s;afety in their delicacy. This metaphor is far from being u&s;ed with a de&s;ign of placing young ladies in a trivial, unimportant light: it is only introduced to in&s;inuate, that where there is more beauty, and more weakne&s;s, there &s;hould be greater circum&s;pection and &s;uperior prudence.</P>
<P>Men, on the contrary, are formed for the more public exhibitions on the great theatre of human life. Like the &s;tronger and more &s;ub&s;tantial wares, they derive no injury, and lo&s;e no poli&s;h, by being always expo&s;ed, and engaged in the con&s;tant com|merce
<PB N="7" REF="024452_0005_0FC74516E12346C0">
of the world. It is their proper element, where they re&s;pire their natural air, and exert their noble&s;t powers, in &s;ituations which call them into action. They were intended by Providence for the bu&s;tling &s;cenes of life&mdash; to appear terrible in arms, u&s;eful in commerce, &s;hining in coun&s;els.</P>
<P>The author fears it will be hazarding a very bold remark, in the opinion of many ladies, when &s;he adds, that the female mind, in general, does not appear capable of attaining &s;o high a degree of per|fection in &s;cience, as the male. Yet &s;he hopes to be forgiven, when &s;he ob&s;erves al&s;o, that as it does not &s;eem to derive the chief portion of its excellence from extraordinary abilities of this kind, it is not at all le&s;&s;ened by the imputation of not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them. It is readily allowed, that the &s;ex have lively imaginations, and tho&s;e exqui&s;ite perceptions of the beautiful and defective, which come under the deno|mination of ta&s;te. But preten&s;ions to that &s;trength of intellect, which is requi&s;ite to penetrate into the ab&s;tru&s;er walks of literature, it is pre&s;umed they will readily relinqui&s;h. There are green pa&s;tures, and plea&s;ant vallies, where they may wander with &s;afety to them&s;elves, and delight to others. They may cultivate the ro&s;es of imagination, and the va|luable fruits of morals and critici&s;m: but the &s;teeps of Parna&s;&s;us, few, comparatively, have attempted to &s;cale with &s;ucce&s;s. And when it is con&s;idered, that many languages, and many &s;ciences, mu&s;t con|tribute to the perfection of poetical compo&s;ition, it will appear le&s;s &s;trange. The lofty epic, the point|ed &s;atire, and the more daring and &s;ucce&s;sful flights of the tragic Mu&s;e, &s;eem re&s;erved for the bold ad|venturers of the other &s;ex.</P>
<P>Nor does this a&s;&s;ertion, it is apprehended, at all injure the intere&s;ts of the women; they have other preten&s;ions, on which to value them&s;elves, and other qualities much better calculated to an&s;wer their par|ticular purpo&s;es. We are enamoured of the &s;oft &s;trains of the Sicilian and the Mantuan Mu&s;e, while, to the &s;weet notes of the pa&s;toral reed, they &s;ing
<PB N="8" REF="024452_0006_0FC7451877D75960">
the contentions of the &s;hepherds, the ble&s;&s;ings of love, or the innocent delights of rural life. Has it ever been a&s;cribed to them as a defect, that their eclog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es do not treat of active &s;cenes, of bu&s;y cities, and of wa&s;ting war? No: their &s;implicity is their perfection; and they are only blamed when they have too little of it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the lofty bards, who &s;trung their bolder harps to higher mea&s;ures, and &s;ung the <HI>Wrath</HI> of <HI>Peleus' &s;on,</HI> and <HI>Man's fir&s;t di&s;obedience,</HI> have never been cen&s;ured for want of &s;weetne&s;s and refinement. The &s;ublime, the nervous, and the ma&s;|culine, characteri&s;e their compo&s;itions; as the beau|tiful, the &s;oft, and the delicate, mark tho&s;e of the others. Grandeur, dignity, and force, di&s;tingui&s;h the one &s;pecies; ea&s;e, &s;implicity, and purity the other. Both &s;hine from their native, di&s;tinct, un|borrowed merits, not from tho&s;e which are foreign, adventitious, and unnatural. Yet tho&s;e excellen|cies, which make up the e&s;&s;ential and con&s;tituent parts of poetry, they have in common.</P>
<P>Women have generally quicker perceptions: men have ju&s;ter &s;entiments.&mdash;Women con&s;ider how things may be prettily &s;aid; men how they may be proper|ly &s;aid.&mdash;In women, (young ones at lea&s;t) &s;peaking accompanies, and &s;ometimes precedes reflexion; in men, reflexion is the antecedent.&mdash;Women &s;peak to &s;hine or to plea&s;e; men, to convince or confute.&mdash; Women admire what is brilliant; men what is &s;olid. Women prefer an extemporaneous &s;ally of wit, or a &s;parkling effu&s;ion of fancy, before the mo&s;t accurate rea&s;oning, or the mo&s;t laborious inve&s;tigations of facts. In literary compo&s;ition, women are plea&s;ed with point, turn, and antithe&s;is; men with ob&s;erva|tion, and a ju&s;t deduction of effects from their cau&s;es. Women are fond of incident, men of argument.&mdash; Women admire pa&s;&s;ionately; men approve cautiou&s;|ly.&mdash;One &s;ex will think it betrays a want of feeling to be moderate in their applau&s;e; the other will be afraid of expo&s;ing a want of judgment by being in raptures with any thing.&mdash;Men refu&s;e to give way to
<PB N="9" REF="024452_0007_0FC7451AC8076F68">
the emotions they actually feel, while women &s;ome|times affect to be tran&s;ported beyond what the occa|&s;ion will ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>As a farther confirmation of what has been advanc|ed on the different bent of the under&s;tanding in the &s;exes, it may be ob&s;erved, that we have heard of many female wits, but never of one female logici|an&mdash;of many admirable writers of memoirs, but ne|ver of one chronologer.&mdash;In the boundle&s;s and aeri|al regions of romance, and in that fa&s;hionable &s;pecies of compo&s;ition which &s;ucceeded it, and which carries a nearer approximation to the manners of the world, the women cannot be excelled: this imaginary &s;oil they have a peculiar talent for cultivating; becau&s;e here,
<Q>Invention labours more, and judgment le&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The merit of this kind of writing con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>vrai-&s;emblance</HI> to real life, as to the events them|&s;elves, with a certain elevation in the narrative, which places them, if not above what is natural, yet above what is common. It farther con&s;i&s;ts in the art of intere&s;ting the tender feelings, by a pathetic re|pre&s;entation of tho&s;e minute, endearing, dome&s;tic circum&s;tances, which take captive the &s;oul before it has time to &s;hield it&s;elf with the armour of reflexi|on. To amu&s;e, rather than to in&s;truct, or to in&s;truct indirectly by &s;hort inferences, drawn from a long concatenation of circum&s;tances, is at once the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of this &s;ort of compo&s;ition, and one of the cha|racteri&s;tics of female genius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author does not apprehend it makes again&s;t her GENERAL po&s;ition, that this nation can boa&s;t a female critic, poet, hi&s;torian, lingui&s;t, philo&s;opher, and morali&s;t, equal to mo&s;t of the other &s;ex. To the&s;e particular in&s;tances others might be adduced; but it is pre&s;umed, that they only &s;tand as excepti|ons again&s;t the rule, without tending to invalidate the rule it&s;elf.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it appears that the mind in each &s;ex has &s;ome natural kind of bias, which con&s;titutes a di&s;|tinction
<PB N="10" REF="024452_0008_0FC7451EFB95EFD0">
of character, and that the happine&s;s of both depends, in a great mea&s;ure, on the pre&s;ervation and ob&s;ervance of this di&s;tinction. For where would be the &s;uperior plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction re&s;ulting from mixed conver&s;ation, if this difference were aboli&s;hed? If the qualities of both were invariably and exactly the &s;ame, no benefit or entertainment would ari&s;e from the tedious and in&s;ipid uniformity of &s;uch an intercour&s;e; whereas con&s;iderable advan|tages are reaped from a &s;elect &s;ociety of both &s;exes. The rough angles and a&s;perities of male manners are imperceptibly filed, and gradually worn &s;mooth, by the poli&s;hing of female conver&s;ation, and the re|fining of female ta&s;te; while the ideas of women acquire &s;trength and &s;olidity, by their a&s;&s;ociating with &s;en&s;ible, intelligent, and judicious men.</P>
<P>On the whole, (even if fame be the object of pur|&s;uit) is it not better to &s;ucceed as women, than to fail as men? To &s;hine, by walking honourably in the road which nature, cu&s;tom, and education &s;eem to have marked out, rather than to counteract them all, by moving awkwardly in a path diametrically oppo&s;ite? To be good originals, rather than bad imitators? In a word, to be excellent women, ra|ther than indifferent men?</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS an argument in favour of modern manners, it has been pleaded, that the &s;ofter vices of luxu|ry and di&s;&s;ipation, belong rather to gentle and yield|ing tempers, than to &s;uch as are rugged and feroci|ous: that they are vices which increa&s;e civilization, and tend to promote refinement, and the cultivation of humanity.</P>
<P>But this is an a&s;&s;ertion, the truth of which the ex|perience of all ages contradicts. Nero was not le&s;s a tyrant for being a &s;iddler; he <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The emperor Caligula.</NOTE> who wi&s;hed the whole Roman people had but one neck, that he might

di&s;patch them at a blow, was him&s;elf the mo&s;t de|bauched man in Rome; and Sydney and Ru&s;&s;el were condemned to bleed under the mo&s;t barbarous, though mo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated and voluptuous reign, that ever di&s;graced the annals of Britain.</P>
<P>The love of di&s;&s;ipation is, I believe, allowed to be the reigning evil of the pre&s;ent day. It is an evil which many content them&s;elves with regretting, without &s;eeking to redre&s;s. A di&s;&s;ipated life is cen|&s;ured in the very act of di&s;&s;ipation; and prodigality of time is as gravely declaimed again&s;t at the card table, as in the pulpit.</P>
<P>The lover of dancing cen&s;ures the amu&s;ements of the theatre for their dulne&s;s, and the game&s;ter blames them both for their levity. She, who&s;e whole &s;oul is &s;wallowed up in "<HI>opera extaci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI>" is a&s;toni&s;hed, that her acquaintance can &s;pend whole nights in preying, like harpies, on the fortunes of their fellow crea|tures; while the grave, &s;ober &s;inner, who pa&s;&s;es her pale and anxious vigils, in this fa&s;hionable &s;ort of pillaging, is no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed how the other can wa&s;te her precious time in hearing &s;ounds for which &s;he has no ta&s;te, in a language &s;he does not under|&s;tand</P>
<P>In &s;hort, every one &s;eems convinced, that the evil &s;o much complained of does really exi&s;t &s;omewhere, though all are inwardly per&s;uaded that it is not with them&s;elves. All de&s;ire a general reformation; but few will li&s;ten to propo&s;als of particular amendment; the body mu&s;t be re&s;tored, but each limb begs to re|main as it is; and accu&s;ations, which concern all, will be likely to affect none. They think that &s;in, like matter, is divi&s;ible, and that what is &s;cattered among &s;o many, cannot materially affect any one; and thus individuals contribute &s;eparately to that evil which they in general lament.</P>
<P>The prevailing manners of an age depend more than we are aware, or are willing to allow, on the conduct of the women; this is one of the principal hinges on which the great machine of human &s;ociety turns. Tho&s;e, who allow the influence which female
<PB N="12" REF="024452_0010_0FC74522F8136090">
graces have, in contributing to poli&s;h the manners of men, would do well to reflect how great an influence female morals mu&s;t al&s;o have on their conduct. How much then is it to be regretted, that the ladies &s;hould ever &s;it down contented to poli&s;h, when they are able to reform&mdash;to entertain, when they might in&s;truct, and to dazzle for an hour, when they are candidates for eternity!</P>
<P>Under the di&s;pen&s;ation of Mahomet's law, indeed, the&s;e mental excellencies cannot be expected; be|cau&s;e the women are &s;hut out from all opportunities of in&s;truction, and excluded from the endearing plea|&s;ures of a delightful and equal &s;ociety; and, as a charming poet &s;ings, are taught to believe, that

<L>Heav'n has re&s;erv'd no future paradi&s;e,</L>

<P>The&s;e act con&s;i&s;tently, in &s;tudying none but exte|rior graces, in cultivating only per&s;onal attractions, and in trying to lighten the intolerable burden of time, by the mo&s;t frivolous and vain amu&s;ements. They act in con&s;equence of their own blind belief, and the tyranny of their de&s;potic ma&s;ters; for they have neither the freedom of a pre&s;ent choice, nor the pro&s;pect of a future being.</P>
<P>But in this land of civil and religious liberty, where there is as little de&s;poti&s;m exerci&s;ed over the minds, as over the per&s;ons of women, they have eve|ry liberty of choice, and every opportunity of im+provement; and how greatly does this increa&s;e their obligation to be exemplary in ther general conduct, attentive to the government of their families, and in&s;trumental to the good order of &s;ociety!</P>
<P>She who is at a lo&s;s to find amu&s;ements at home, can no longer apologize for her di&s;&s;ipation abroad, by &s;aying &s;he is deprived of the benefit and the plea|&s;ure of books; and &s;he who regrets being doomed to a &s;tate of dark and gloomy ignorance, by the inju&s;tice,

<P>It is a que&s;tion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">requently in the mouths of illiter|ate and di&s;&s;ipated females&mdash;"What good is there in reading? To what end does it conduce?" It is, how|ever, too obvious to need in&s;i&s;ting on, that unle&s;s perverted, as the be&s;t things may be, reading an|&s;wers many excellent purpo&s;es, be&s;ides the great leading one, and is perhaps the &s;afe&s;t remedy for di&s;&s;ipation. She who dedicates a portion of her lei|&s;ure to u&s;eful reading, feels her mind in a con&s;tant progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of improvement, while the mind of a di&s;&s;iputed woman is continually lo&s;ing ground. An active &s;pirit rejoiceth, like the &s;un, to run his daily cour&s;e, while indolence, like the dial of Ahaz, goes backwards. The advantages which the under&s;tand|ing receives from polite literature, it is not here nece&s;&s;ary to enumerate; its effects on the moral tem|per is the pre&s;ent object of con&s;ideration. The re|mark may perhaps be thought too &s;trong, but I believe it is true, that, next to religious influences, an habit of &s;tudy is the mo&s;t probable pre&s;ervative of the virtue of young per&s;ons. Tho&s;e who cultivate letters have rarely a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for promi&s;cuous vi&s;iting, or di&s;&s;ipated &s;ociety: &s;tudy, therefore, in|duces a reli&s;h for dome&s;tic life, the mo&s;t de&s;irable temper in the world for women. Study, as it re&s;cues the mind from an inordinate fondne&s;s for gaming, dre&s;s, and public amu&s;ements, is an economical pro|pen&s;ity&punc; for a lady may read at much le&s;s expen&s;e than &s;he can play at cards&punc; as it requires &s;ome appli|cation, it gives the mind an habit of indu&s;try; as it is a relief again&s;t that mental di&s;ea&s;e, which the French emphatically call <HI>ennui,</HI> it cannot fail of being beneficial to the temper and &s;pirits, I mean in the moderate degree in which ladies are &s;uppo&s;ed to u&s;e it; as an enemy to indolence, it becomes a &s;ocial virtue; as it demands the full exertion of our talents, it grows a rational duty; and, when directed to the knowledge of the Supreme Being, and his laws, it ri&s;es into an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of religion.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="024452_0012_0FC7452B4352E420">The rage for reformation commonly &s;hows it&s;elf in a violent zeal for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing what is wrong, rather than a prudent attention to e&s;tabli&s;h what is right: but we &s;hall never obtain a fair garden merely by rooting up weeds; we mu&s;t al&s;o plant flowers; for the natural richne&s;s of the &s;oil we have been clearing will not &s;uffer it to lie barren; but whether it &s;hall be vainly or beneficially prolific, depends on the cul|ture. What the pre&s;ent age has gained on one &s;ide, by a more enlarged and liberal way of thinking, &s;eems to be lo&s;t on the other, by exce&s;&s;ive freedom and unbounded indulgence. Knowledge is not, as heretofore, confined to the dull cloy&s;ter, or the gloomy college, but di&s;&s;eminated, to a certain degree, among both &s;exes and almo&s;t all ranks. The only misfortune is, that the&s;e opportunities do not &s;eem to be &s;o wi&s;ely improved, or turned to &s;o good an account as might be wi&s;hed. Books of a pernici|ous, idle, and frivolous &s;ort, are too much multipli|ed, and it is from the very redundancy of them, that true knowledge is &s;o &s;carce, and the habit of di&s;&s;ipa|tion &s;o much increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, that the prevailing charac|ter of the pre&s;ent age is not that of gro&s;s immorality: but if this is meant of tho&s;e in the higher walks of life, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern, that there can be but little merit in ab&s;taining from crimes which there is but little temptation to commit. It is, however, to be feared, that a gradual defection from piety, will in time draw after it all the bad con&s;equences of more active vice; for whether mounds and fences are &s;ud|denly de&s;troyed by a &s;weeping torrent, or worn away through gradual neglect, the effect is equally de&s;tructive.

For it is in moral as in na|tural things; the motion in minds as well as bodies is accelerated by a nearer approach to the centre, to which they are tending.

<P>A con&s;tant habit of amu&s;ement relaxes the tone of the mind, and renders it totally incapable of ap|plication, &s;tudy, or virtue. Di&s;&s;ipation not only in|di&s;po&s;es its votaries to every thing u&s;eful and excel|lent, but di&s;qualifies them for the enjoyment of plea|&s;ure it&s;elf. It &s;oftens the &s;oul &s;o much, that the mo&s;t &s;uperficial employment becomes a labour, and the &s;lighte&s;t inconvenience an agony.

<P>Luxury and di&s;&s;ipation, &s;oft and gentle as their approaches are, and &s;ilently as they throw their &s;ilken chains about the heart, en&s;lave it more than the mo&s;t active and turbulent vices. The mightie&s;t conquerors have been conquered by tho&s;e unarmed foes: the flowery fetters are fa&s;tened before they are felt.

Hercules, after he had clean&s;ed the Augean &s;table, and performed all the other labours enjoined him by Euri&s;theus, found him&s;elf a &s;lave to the &s;oftne&s;s of the heart; and he, who wore a club and a lion's &s;kin in the cau&s;e of vir|tue, conde&s;cended to the mo&s;t effeminate employ|ments to gratify a criminal weakne&s;s.

<HEAD>On Conver&s;ation.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been advi&s;ed, and by very re&s;pectable au|thorities too, that in conver&s;ation women &s;hould carefully conceal any knowledge or learning they may happen to po&s;&s;e&s;s. I own with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that I do not &s;ee either the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of this advice. For if a young lady has that di&s;cretion and mode&s;ty, without which all knowledge is little worth, &s;he will never make an o&s;tentatious parade of it, be|cau&s;e &s;he will rather be intent on acquiring more, than on di&s;playing what &s;he has.</P>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s to know why a young female is in|&s;tructed to exhibit, in the mo&s;t advantageous point of view, her &s;kill in mu&s;ic, her &s;inging, dancing, ta&s;te in dre&s;s, and her acquaintance with the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;hionable games and amu&s;ements, while her piety

is to be anxiou&s;ly concealed, and her knowledge af|fectedly di&s;avowed, le&s;t the former &s;hould draw on her the appellation of an enthu&s;ia&s;t, or the latter that of a pedant.</P>
<P>In regard to knowledge, why &s;hould &s;he forever affect to be on her guard, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be found guilty of a &s;mall portion of it? She need be the le&s;s &s;olicitous about it, as it &s;eldom proves to be &s;o very con&s;iderable as to excite a&s;toni&s;hment or admiration: for, after all the acqui&s;itions which her talents and her &s;tudies have enabled her to make, &s;he will, ge|nerally &s;peaking, be found to have le&s;s of what is called <HI>learning,</HI> than a common &s;chool boy.</P>
<P>It would be to the la&s;t degree pre&s;umptuous and ab&s;urd, for a young woman to pretend to give the <HI>ton</HI> to the company&mdash;to interrupt the plea&s;ure of others, and her own opportunity of improvement, by talking when &s;he ought to li&s;ten&mdash;or to introduce &s;ubjects out of the common road, in order to &s;how her own wit, or to expo&s;e the want of it in others: but were the &s;ex to be totally &s;ilent when any topic of literature happens to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in their pre|&s;ence, conver&s;ation would lo&s;e much of its vivacity and &s;ociety would be robbed of one of its mo&s;t inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+e&s;ting charms.</P>
<P>How ea&s;ily and effectually may a well-bred woman promote the mo&s;t u&s;eful and elegant conver&s;ation, al|mo&s;t without &s;peaking a word! for the modes of &s;peech are &s;carcely more variable than the modes of &s;ilence. The &s;ilence of li&s;tle&s;s ignorance, and the &s;ilence of &s;parkling intelligence, are perhaps as &s;e|parately marked, and as di&s;tinctly expre&s;&s;ed, as the &s;ame feelings could have been by the mo&s;t unequivo|cal language. A woman, in a company where &s;he has the lea&s;t influence, may promote any &s;ubject by a profound and invariable attention, which &s;hows that &s;he is plea&s;ed with it, and by an illuminated countenance, which proves &s;he under&s;tands it. This obliging attention is the mo&s;t flattering encourage|ment in the world to men of &s;en&s;e and letters, to continue any topic of in&s;truction or entertainment

they happen to be engaged in: it owed its intro|duction perhaps to accident, the be&s;t introduction in the world for a &s;ubject of ingenuity, which, though it could not have been formally propo&s;ed without ped<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntry, may be continued with ea&s;e and good hu|mour; but which will be frequently and effectually &s;topped by the liftle&s;&s;ne&s;s, inattention, or whi&s;pering of &s;illy girls, who&s;e wearine&s;s betrays their igno|rance, and who&s;e impatience expo&s;es their ill-breed|ing. A polite man, however deeply intere&s;ted in the &s;ubject on which he is conver&s;ing, catches at the &s;lighte&s;t hint to have done: a look is a &s;ufficient in|timation, and if a pretty &s;impleton, who &s;its near him, &s;eems <HI>di&s;traite,</HI> he puts an end to his remarks, to the great regret of the rea&s;onable part of the company, who perhaps might have gained more im|provement by the continuance of &s;uch a conver&s;ati|on, than a week's reading would have yielded them; for it is &s;uch company as this, that give an edge to each other's wit, "as iron &s;harpeneth iron."</P>
<P>That &s;ilence is one of the great arts of conver&s;a|tion is allowed by Cicero him&s;elf, who &s;ays, there is not only an art, but even an eloquence in it. And this opinion is confirmed by a great modern<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Bacon.</NOTE>, in the following little anecdote from one of the ancients:</P>
<P>When many Grecian philo&s;ophers had a &s;olemn meeting before the amba&s;&s;ador of a foreign prince, each endeavoured to &s;how his parts by the brilliancy of his conver&s;ation, that the amba&s;&s;ador might have &s;omething to relate of the Grecian wi&s;dom. One of them, offended, no doubt, at the loquacity of his companions, ob&s;erved a profound &s;ilence; when the amba&s;&s;ador, turning to him, a&s;ked,

<P>There is a quality infinitely more intoxicating to the female mind than knowledge; this is wit, the

mo&s;t captivating, but the mo&s;t dreaded of all talents: the mo&s;t dangerous to tho&s;e who have it, and the mo&s;t feared by tho&s;e who have it not. Though it is again&s;t all the rules, yet I cannot find in my heart to abu&s;e this charming quality. He who is grown rich with|out it, in &s;afe and &s;ober dulne&s;s, &s;huns it as a di&s;ea&s;e, and looks upon poverty as its invariable concomi|tant. The morali&s;t declaims again&s;t it, as the &s;ource of irregularity; and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy it&s;elf; for he con&s;iders it as the parent of extravagance and beggary. The cy|nic will a&s;k of what u&s;e it is? Of very little per|haps: no more is a flower garden, and yet it is al|lowed as an object of innocent amu&s;ement and de|lightful recreation. A woman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this quality, has received a mo&s;t dangerous pre&s;ent, per|haps not le&s;s &s;o than beauty it&s;elf: e&s;pecially if it be not &s;heathed in a temper peculiarly inoffen&s;ive, cha&s;|ti&s;ed by a mo&s;t correct judgment, and re&s;trained by more prudence than falls to the common lot.</P>
<P>This talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for as wit is the immediate pro|perty of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and learning is only an ac|quaintance with the knowledge of other people, there is much more danger, that we &s;hould be vain of what is our own, than of what we borrow.</P>
<P>But wit, like learning, is not near &s;o common a thing as is imagined. Let not, therefore, a young lady be alarmed at the acutene&s;s of her own wit, any more than at the abundance of her own knowledge. The great danger is, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould mi&s;take pertne&s;s, flippancy, or imprudence, for this brilliant quality, or imagine &s;he is witty, only becau&s;e &s;he is indi&s;creet. This is very frequently the ca&s;e; and this makes the name of wit &s;o cheap, while its real exi&s;tence is &s;o rare.</P>
<P>Le&s;t the flattery of her acquaintance, or an over|weening opinion of her own qualifications, &s;hould lead &s;ome vain and petulant girl into a fal&s;e notion that &s;he has a great deal of wit, when &s;he has only a redundancy of animal &s;pirits, &s;he may not find it u&s;e|le&s;s

<P>But tho&s;e who actually po&s;&s;e&s;s this rare talent, cannot be too ab&s;tinent in the u&s;e of it. It often makes admirers, but it never makes friends; I mean, where it is the predominant feature; and the un|protected and defencele&s;s &s;tate of womanhood calls for friend&s;hip more than for admiration.

thought, that he will have the appearance of a con|fu&s;ed and perplexed expre&s;&s;ion; while a &s;prightly woman will extricate her&s;elf with that lively and "ra&s;h dexterity," which will almo&s;t always plea&s;e, though it is very far from being always right. It is ea&s;ier to confound than to convince an opponent; the former may be effected by a turn that has more happi|ne&s;s than truth in it. Many an excellent rea&s;oner, well &s;killed in the theory of the &s;chools, has felt him&s;elf di&s;comfited by a reply, which, though as wide of the mark, and as foreign to the que&s;tion, as can be conceived, has di&s;concerted him more than the mo&s;t &s;tartling propo&s;iton, or the mo&s;t accurate chain of rea&s;oning could have done; and he has borne the laugh of his fair antagoni&s;t, as well as of the whole company, though he could not but feel, that his own argument was attended with the fulle&s;t demon&s;trati|on: &s;o true it is, that it is not always nece&s;&s;ary to be right, in order to be applauded.</P>
<P>But let not a young lady's vanity be too much elated with this fal&s;e applau&s;e, which is given, not to merit, but to her &s;ex: &s;he has not, perhaps, gained a victory, though &s;he may be allowed a triumph; and it &s;hould humble her to reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her &s;trength, but to her weakne&s;s. It is worth while to di&s;criminate between that applau&s;e, which is given from the complai&s;ance of others, and that which is paid to our own merit.</P>
<P>Where great &s;prightline&s;s is the natural bent of the temper, girls &s;hould endeavour to habituate them&s;elves to a cu&s;tom of ob&s;erving, thinking, and rea&s;oning. I do not mean that they &s;hould devote them&s;elves to ab&s;tru&s;e &s;peculation, or the &s;tudy of logic; but &s;he, who is accu&s;tomed to give a due ar|rangement to her thoughts, to rea&s;on ju&s;tly and pertinently, on common affairs, and judiciou&s;ly to deduce effects from their cau&s;es, will be a better logician tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome of tho&s;e who claim the name, be|cau&s;e they have &s;tudied the art: this is being "learn|ed without the rules;" the be&s;t definition, per|haps, of that &s;ort of literature which is propere&s;t for

the &s;ex. That &s;pecies of knowledge, which appears to be the re&s;ult of reflexion rather than of &s;cience, &s;its peculiarly well on women. It is not uncommon to find a lady, who, though &s;he does not know a rule of &s;yntax, &s;carcely ever violates one; and who con&s;tucts every &s;entence &s;he utters, with more pro|priety than many a learned dunce, who has every rule of Ari&s;totle by heart, and who can lace his own thread-bare di&s;cour&s;e with the golden &s;hreds of Cice|ro and Virgil.</P>
<P>It has been objected, and I fear with &s;ome rea&s;on, that female conver&s;ation is too frequently tinctured with a cen&s;orious &s;pirit, and that ladies are &s;eldom apt to di&s;cover much tenderne&s;s for the errors of a fallen &s;i&s;ter.
<Q>If it be &s;o, it is a grievous fault.</Q>
No arguments can ju&s;tify, no pleas can extenuate it To exult over the mi&s;eries of an unhappy creature is inhuman: not to compa&s;&s;ionate them is unchri&s;tian. The worthy part of the &s;ex always expre&s;s them|&s;elves humanely on the failings of others, in propor|tion to their own undeviating goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>And here I cannot help remarking, that young women do not always carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between running into the error of detraction, and its oppo|&s;ite extreme of indi&s;criminate applau&s;e. This pro|ceeds from the fal&s;e idea they entertain, that the direct contrary to what is wrong, mu&s;t be right. Thus the dread of being only &s;u&s;pected of one fault, makes them actually guilty of another. The de&s;ire of avoiding the imputation of envy, impels them to be in&s;incere; and to e&s;tabli&s;h a reputation for &s;weet|ne&s;s of temper and genero&s;ity, they affect &s;ometimes to &s;peak of very indifferent characters with the mo&s;t extravagant applau&s;e. With &s;uch the hyperbole is a favourite figure; and every degree of compari&s;on, but the &s;uperlative, is rejected, as cold and inexpre&s;&s;ive. But this habit of exaggeration greatly weakens their credit, and de&s;troys the weight of their opinion on other occa&s;ions; for people very &s;oon di&s;cover what
<PB N="27" REF="024452_0025_0FC7456E069472C0">
degree of faith is to be given both to their judgment and veracity. And tho&s;e of real merit will no more be flattered by that approbation, which cannot di&s;|tingui&s;h the value of what it prai&s;es, than the cele|brated painter mu&s;t have been at the judgment pa&s;&s;ed on his works by an ignorant &s;pectator, who, being a&s;ked what he thought of &s;uch and &s;uch very capital but very different pieces, cried out in an affected rap|ture, "All alike! all alike!"</P>
<P>It has been propo&s;ed to the young, as a maxim of &s;upreme wi&s;dom, to manage &s;o dexterou&s;ly in con|ver&s;ation, as to appear to be well acquainted with &s;ubjects, of which they are totally ignorant; and this, by affecting &s;ilence in regard to tho&s;e, on which they are known to excel.&mdash;But why coun&s;el this di&s;inge|nuous fraud? Why add to the numberle&s;s arts of deceit, this practice of deceiving, as it were, on a &s;ettled principle? If to di&s;avow the knowledge they really have, be a culpable affectation, then certain|ly to in&s;inuate an idea of their &s;kill where they are actually ignorant, is a mo&s;t unworthy artifice.</P>
<P>But of all the qualifications for conver&s;ation, hu|mility, if not the mo&s;t brilliant, is the &s;afe&s;t, the mo&s;t amiable, and the mo&s;t feminine. The affectati|on of introducing &s;ubjects, with which others are unacquainted, and of di&s;playing talents &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the company, is as dangerous as it is fooli&s;h.</P>
<P>There are many, who never can forgive another for being more agreeable and more accompli&s;hed than them&s;elves, and who can pardon any offence rather than an eclip&s;ing merit. Had the nightingale in the fable conquered his vanity, and re&s;i&s;ted the temptation of &s;howing a fine voice, he might have e&s;caped the talons of the hawk. The melody of his &s;inging was the cau&s;e of his de&s;truction; his merit brought him into danger, and his vanity co&s;t him his life.</P>

<P>"ENVY," &s;ays Lord Bacon, "has no holidays." There cannot, perhaps, be a more lively and &s;triking de&s;cription of the mi&s;erable &s;tate of mind tho&s;e endure, who are tormented with this vice. A &s;pirit of emulation has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ource of the greate&s;t improvements; and there is no doubt but the warme&s;t rival&s;hip will produce the mo&s;t excellent effects; but it is to be feared, that a perpetual &s;tate of conte&s;t will injure the temper &s;o e&s;|&s;entially, that the mi&s;chief will hardly be counter-balanced by any other advantages. Tho&s;e, who&s;e progre&s;s is the mo&s;t rapid, will be apt to de&s;pi&s;e their le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful competitors, who, in return, will feel the bittere&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t their more fortunate rivals. Among per&s;ons of real goodne&s;s, this jealou&s;y and contempt can never be equally felt; becau&s;e every advancement in piety will be attended with a proportionable encrea&s;e of humility, which will lead them to contemplate their own improve|ments with mode&s;ty, and to view with charity the mi&s;carriages of others.</P>
<P>When an envious man is melancholy, one may a&s;k him, in the words of Bion, what evil has befallen him&s;elf, or what good has happened to another? This la&s;t is the &s;cale by which he principally mea|&s;ures his felicity, and the very &s;miles of his friends are &s;o many deductions from his own happine&s;s. The wants of others are the &s;tandard by which he rates his own wealth; and he e&s;timates his riches not &s;o much by his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as by the nece&s;&s;ities of his neighbours.</P>

<P>When you tell tho&s;e of a malicious turn, any cir|cum&s;tance that has happened to another, though they perfectly know of whom you are &s;peaking, they often affect to be at a lo&s;s, to forget his name, or to mi&s;|apprehend you in &s;ome re&s;pect or other; and this,
<PB N="31" REF="024452_0029_0FC7458B013AC9F0">
merely to have an apportunity of &s;lily gratifying their malice, by mentioning &s;ome unhappy defect or per&s;onal infirmity he labours under; and not content|ed "to tack his every error to his name," they will by way of farther explanation, have recour&s;e to the faults of his father, or the misfortunes of his fami|ly; and this, with all the &s;eeming &s;implicity and candour in the world, merely for the &s;ake of pre|venting mi&s;takes, and to clear up every doubt of his identy.&mdash;If you are &s;peaking of a lady, for in&s;tance, they will perhaps embelli&s;h their enquiries, by a&s;k|ing, if you mean her, who&s;e great grandfather was a bankrupt, though &s;he has the vanity to keep a cha|riot, while others who are much better born walk on foot; for they will afterwards recollect, that you may po&s;&s;ibly mean her cou&s;in, of the &s;ame name, who&s;e mother was &s;u&s;pected of &s;uch or &s;uch an in|di&s;cretion, though the daughter had the luck to make her fortune by marrying, while her betters are over|looked.</P>
<P>To <HI>hint at a fault,</HI> does more mi&s;chief than &s;peak|ing out; for whatever is left for the imagination to fini&s;h, will not fail to be overdone: every hiatus will be more than filled up, and every pau&s;e more than &s;upplied. There is le&s;s malice, and le&s;s mi&s;chief too, in telling a man's name, than the initials of it; as a worthier per&s;on may be involved in the mo&s;t di&s;|graceful &s;u&s;picions by &s;uch a dangerous ambiguity.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon for the envious, after having attempted to deface the faire&s;t character &s;o indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly, that they are afraid you will begin to detect their malice, to endeavour to remove your &s;u&s;pici|ons effectually, by a&s;&s;uring you, that
<Q>what they have ju&s;t related is only the popular opinion; they them&s;elves can never believe things are &s;o bad as they are &s;aid to be; for their part, it is a rule with them always to hope the be&s;t.

An <HI>if,</HI> or a <HI>but,</HI> or a mortified look, or a languid defence, or an ambiguous &s;hake of the head, or a ha&s;ty word affec|tedly recalled, will demoli&s;h a character more ef|fectually, than the whole artillery of malice, when openly levelled again&s;t it.</P>
<P>It is not that envy never prai&s;es: No, that would be making a public profe&s;&s;ion of it&s;elf, and adverti&s;|ing its own malignity; whereas the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s of its efforts depends on the concealment of their end. When envy intends to &s;trike a &s;troke of Ma|chiavelian policy, it &s;ometimes affects the language of the mo&s;t exaggerated applau&s;e; though it gener|ally takes care, that the &s;ubject of its panegyric &s;hall be a very indifferent and common character, &s;o that it is well aware none of its prai&s;es will &s;tick.</P>
<P>It is the unhappy nature of envy not to be con|tented with po&s;itive mi&s;ery, but to be continually ag|gravating its own torments, by comparing them with the felicities of others. The eyes of envy are perpetually fixed on the object which di&s;turbs it, nor can it avert them from it, though to procure it&s;elf the relief of a temporary forgetfulne&s;s.

<P>As this enormous &s;in chiefly in&s;tigated the revolt, and brought on the ruin, of the angelic &s;pirits, &s;o it is not improbable, that it will be a principal in&s;tru|ment of mi&s;ery in a future world, for the envious to compare their de&s;perate condition with the hap|pine&s;s of the children of God, and to heighten their actual wretchedne&s;s by reflecting on what they have lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Perhaps envy, like lying and ingratitude, is prac|ti&s;ed with more frequency, becau&s;e it is practi&s;ed with impunity; but there being no human laws a|gain&s;t the&s;e crimes, is &s;o far from an inducement to

<P>Error is never likely to do &s;o much mi&s;chief, as when it di&s;gui&s;es its real tendency, and puts on an engaging and attractive appearance.

<P>Such an engagement will be infinitely dearer to her vanity, than an avowed and authorized attach|ment; for one of the&s;e &s;entimental lovers will not &s;cru|ple very &s;eriou&s;ly to a&s;&s;ure a credulous girl, that her unparalleled merit entitles her to the adoration of the whole world, and that the univer&s;al homage of mankind is nothing more than the unavoidable tri|bute extorted by her charms. No wonder then &s;he &s;hould be &s;o ea&s;ily prevailed on to believe, that an individual is captivated by perfections which might en&s;lave a million. But &s;he &s;hould remember, that he, who endeavours to intoxicate her with adulation, intends one day mo&s;t effectually to humble her. For an artful man has always a &s;ecret de&s;ign to pay him|&s;elf in future for every pre&s;ent &s;acrifice.

<P>A &s;entimental girl very rarely entertains any doubt of her per&s;onal beauty; for &s;he has been daily ac|cu&s;tomed to contemplate it her&s;elf, and to hear of it from others.

That wealth, which lately &s;eemed to be looked on with ineffable contempt by the lover, now appears to be the principal attraction in the eyes of the hu&s;|band: and he, who but a few &s;hort weeks before, in a tran&s;port of &s;entimental genero&s;ity, wi&s;hed her to have been a village maid, with no portion but her crook and her beauty, and that they might &s;pend their days in pa&s;toral love and innocence, has now lo&s;t all reli&s;h for the Arcadian life, or any other life in which &s;he mu&s;t be his companion.</P>

No lon|ger is &s;he gratified with the tear of counterfeited pa&s;&s;ion, the &s;igh of di&s;&s;embled rapture, or the lan|guage of premeditated adoration. No longer is the altar of her vanity loaded with the oblations of fic|titious fondne&s;s, the incen&s;e of fal&s;ehood, or the &s;a|crifice of flattery.&mdash;Her apotheo&s;is is ended!

<P>Thus much for the <HI>completion</HI> of the &s;entimental hi&s;tory. If we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ace it back to its beginning, we &s;hall find, that a dam&s;el of this ca&s;t had her head ori|ginally turned by pernicious reading, and her in&s;ani|ty confirmed by imprudent friend&s;hips. She never fails to &s;elect a beloved <HI>confidante</HI> of her own turn and humour, though, if &s;he can help it, not quite &s;o hand&s;ome as her&s;elf. A violent intimacy en&s;ues, or, to &s;peak the language of &s;entiment, an intimate union of &s;ouls immediately takes place, which is wrought to the highe&s;t pitch, by a &s;ecret and voluminous corre&s;pond|ence, though they live in the &s;ame &s;treet, or perhaps in the &s;ame hou&s;e. This is the fuel which principal|ly feeds and &s;upplies the dangerous flame of &s;enti|ment. In this corre&s;pondence the two friends encou|rage each other in the fal&s;e&s;t notions imaginable. They repre&s;ent romantic love as the great important bu&s;ine&s;s of human life, and de&s;cribe all the other concerns of it as too low and paltry to merit the attention of &s;uch elevated beings, and fit only to em|ploy the daughters of the plodding vulgar. In the&s;e letters, family affairs are mi&s;repre&s;ented, family &s;e|crets divulged, and family misfortunes aggravated. They are filled with vows of eternal amity, and pro|te&s;tations of never-ending love. But interjections and quotations are the principal embelli&s;hments of the&s;e very &s;ublime epi&s;tles. Every panegyric con|tained in them is extravagant and hyperbolical, e|very cen&s;ure exaggerated and exce&s;&s;ive. In a favour|ite, every frailty is heightened into a perfection, and in a foe, degraded into a crime. The dramatic poets, e&s;pecially the mo&s;t tender and romantic, are quoted in almo&s;t every line, and every pompous or pathe|tic thought is forced to give up its natural and ob|vious meaning, and, with all the violence of mi&s;ap|plication, is compelled to &s;uit &s;ome circum&s;tance of imaginary woe of the fair tran&s;criber.

<P>Nothing can equal the a&s;toni&s;hment of the&s;e &s;oar|ing &s;pirits, when their plain friends or prudent re|lations pre&s;ume to remon&s;trate with them on any impropriety in their conduct. But if the&s;e worthy people happen to be &s;omewhat advanced in life, their contempt is then a little &s;oftened by pity, at the reflexion that &s;uch very antiquated, poor crea|tures &s;hould pretend to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies of their great refinement, &s;en&s;e, and reading. They con&s;ider them as wretches utterly ignorant of the &s;ublime plea&s;ures of a delicate and exalted pa&s;&s;i|on; as tyrants who&s;e authority is to be contemn|ed, and as &s;pies who&s;e vigilance is to be eluded. The prudence of the&s;e worthy friends they term &s;u&s;picion, and their experience dotage. For they are per&s;uaded, that the face of things has &s;o totally changed, &s;ince their parents were young, that though they might then judge tolerably for them&s;elves, yet they are now (with all their advantages of know|ledge and ob&s;ervation) by no means qualified to direct their more enlightened daughters; who, if they have made a great progre&s;s in the &s;entimental walk, will

be no more influenced by the advice of their mother, than they would go abroad in her laced pinner, or her brocade &s;uit.</P>
<P>But young people never &s;how their folly and igno|rance more con&s;picuou&s;ly, than by this over confi|dence in their own judgment, and this haughty di&s;|dain of the opinion of tho&s;e who have known more days. Youth has a quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, which it is very apt to mi&s;take for an acutene&s;s of penetra|tion. But youth, like cunning, though very conceit|ed, is very &s;hort-&s;ighted, and never more &s;o than when it di&s;regards the in&s;tructions of the wi&s;e, and the admonitions of the aged. The &s;ame vices and follies influenced the human heart in their day, which influence it now, and nearly in the &s;ame manner. One, who well knew the world and its various vani|ties, has &s;aid:
<Q>The thing which hath been, it is that which &s;hall be, and that which is done is that which &s;hall be done, and there is no new thing under the &s;un.</Q></P>
<P>It is al&s;o a part of the &s;entimental character, to imagine that none but the young and the beautiful have any right to the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, or even to the common benefits and ble&s;&s;ings of life. Ladies of this turn al&s;o affect the mo&s;t lofty di&s;regard for u&s;eful qualities and dome&s;tic virtues; and this is a natural con&s;equence; for as this &s;ort of &s;entiment is only a word for idlene&s;s, &s;he who is con&s;tantly and u&s;efully employed, has neither lei&s;ure nor propen|&s;ity to cultivate it.</P>
<P>A &s;entimental lady principally values her&s;elf on the enlargement of her notions, and her liberal way of thinking. This &s;uperiority of &s;oul chiefly mani|fe&s;ts it&s;elf in the contempt of the&s;e minute delicacies and little decorums, which, trifling as they may be thought, tend at once to dignify the character, and to re&s;train the levity of the younger part of the &s;ex.</P>
<P>Perhaps the error here complained of, originates in mi&s;taking <HI>&s;entiment</HI> and <HI>principle</HI> for each other. Now I conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive them to be extremely different. Sen|timent

And enthu|&s;ia&s;m is &s;o far from being di&s;agreeable, that a por|tion of it is perhaps indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in an en|gaging woman. But it mu&s;t be the enthua&s;ia&s;m of the heart, not of the &s;en&s;es&punc; it mu&s;t be the enthu&s;ia&s;m which grows up with a feeling mind, and is cheri&s;h|ed by a virtuous education&mdash;not that which is com|pounded of irregular pa&s;&s;ions, and artificially refin|ed by books of unnatural fiction and improbable ad|venture. I will even go &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert, that a young woman cannot have any real greatne&s;s of &s;oul, or true clevation of principle, if &s;he has not a tinc|ture of what the vulgar would call Romance, but which per&s;ons of a certain way of thinking will di&s;cern to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oceed from tho&s;e fine feelings, and that charming &s;en&s;ibility, without which, though a wo|man may be worthy, yet &s;he can never be amiable.</P>
<P>But this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched, as it is very apt to lead tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it into inconveniences from which le&s;s intere&s;ting characters are happily exempt.

hate with all their hearts, and &s;carcely &s;uffer them|&s;elves to feel a rea&s;onable preference, before it &s;trengthens into a violent attachment.</P>
<P>When an innocent girl, of this open, tru&s;ting, tender heart, happens to meet with one of her own &s;ex and age, who&s;e addre&s;s and manners are engag|ing, &s;he is in&s;tantly &s;eized with an ardent de&s;ire to commence a friend&s;hip with her. She feels the mo&s;t lively impatience at the re&s;traints of company, and the decorums of ceremony. She longs to be alone with her, longs to a&s;&s;ure her of the warmth of her tenderne&s;s, and generou&s;ly a&s;cribes to the fair &s;tran|ger all the good qualities &s;he feels in her own heart, or ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her all tho&s;e which &s;he has met with, in her reading, di&s;per&s;ed in a variety of heroines. She is per&s;uaded, that her new friend unites them all in her&s;elf, becau&s;e &s;he carries in her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing coun|tenance the promi&s;e of them all. How cruel and how cen&s;orious would this inexperienced girl think her mother was, who &s;hould venture to hint, that the agreeable unknown had defects in her temper, or exceptions in her character! She would mi&s;take the&s;e hints of di&s;cretion for the in&s;inuations of an uncharitable di&s;po&s;ition. At fir&s;t &s;he would perhaps li&s;ten to them with a generous impatience, and af|terwards with a cold and &s;ilent di&s;dain. She would de&s;pi&s;e them as the effect of prejudice, mi&s;repre&s;en|tation, or ignorance. The more aggravated the cen&s;ure, the more vehemently would &s;he prote&s;t in &s;ecret, that her friend&s;hip for this dear injured crea|ture (who is rai&s;ed much higher in her e&s;teem by &s;uch injurious &s;u&s;picions) &s;hall know no bounds, as &s;he is a&s;&s;ured it can know no end.</P>
<P>Yet this tru&s;ting confidence, this hone&s;t indi&s;cre|tion, is, at this early period of life, as amiable as it is natural; and will, if wi&s;ely cultivated, produce, at its proper &s;ea&s;on, fruits infinitely more valuable than all the guarded circum&s;pection of premature, and therefore artificial prudence. Men, I believe, are &s;eldom &s;truck with the&s;e &s;udden prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of each other. They are not &s;o un&s;u&s;pect|ing,
<PB N="44" REF="024452_0042_0FC74678ADB51C60">
nor &s;o ea&s;ily led away by the predominance of fancy. They engage more warily, and pa&s;s through the &s;everal &s;tages of acquaintance, intimacy, and confidence, by flower gradations; but women, if they are &s;ometimes deceived in the choice of a friend, enjoy even then an higher degree of &s;atisfaction, than if they never tru&s;ted. For to be always clad in the burden&s;ome armour of &s;u&s;picion, is more pain|ful and inconvenient, than to run the hazard of &s;uf|fering now and then a tran&s;ient injury.</P>
<P>But the above ob&s;ervations only extend to the young and the inexperienced; for I am very cer|tain, that women are capable of as faithful and as durable friend&s;hip as any of the other &s;ex. They can enter not only into all the enthu&s;ia&s;tic tender|ne&s;s, but into all the &s;olid fidelity of attachment. And if we cannot oppo&s;e in&s;tances of equal weight with tho&s;e of Ny&s;us and Euryalus, The&s;eus and Pi|rithous, Pylades and Ore&s;tes, let it be remembered, that it is becau&s;e the recorders of tho&s;e characters were men, and that the very exi&s;tence of them is merely poetical.</P>

<P>Yet nothing is more common than to mi&s;take the &s;ign for the thing it&s;elf; nor is any practice more frequent, than that of endeavouring to acquire the exterior mark, without once thinking to labour af|ter the interior grace.

To regulate the features, while the &s;oul is in tumults, or to command the voice, while the pa&s;&s;ions are without re&s;traint, is as idle as throw|ing odours into a &s;tream when the &s;ource is pol|luted.</P>

<P>A very termagant woman, if &s;he happens al&s;o to be a very artful one, will be con&s;cious &s;he has &s;o much to conceal, that the dread of betraying her real tem|per, will make her put on an over-acted &s;oftne&s;s, which, from its very exce&s;s, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the natural by a penetrating eye. That gen|tlene&s;s is ever liable to be &s;u&s;pected for the counter|feited, which is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to deprive people of the proper u&s;e of &s;peech, and motion, or which, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ays, makes them li&s;p and amble, and nick|name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s creatures.</P>
<P>The countenance and manners of &s;ome very fa|&s;hionable per&s;ons may be compared to the in&s;crip|tions on their monuments, which &s;peak nothing but good of what is within; but he who knows any thing of the world, or of the human heart, will no more tru&s;t to the countenance than he will depend on the epitaph.</P>
<P>Among the various artifices of factitious meekne&s;s, one of the mo&s;t frequent and mo&s;t plau&s;ible, is that of affecting to be always equally delighted with all per&s;ons and all characters. The &s;ociety of the&s;e lan|guid beings is without confidence; their friend&s;hip without attachment; and their love without affec|tion, or even preference. This in&s;ipid mode of con|duct may be &s;afe; but I cannot think it has either ta&s;te, &s;en&s;e, or principle in it.</P>
<P>The&s;e uniformly &s;miling and approving ladies, who have neither the noble courage to reprehend vice, nor the generous warmth to bear their hone&s;t te&s;timony in the cau&s;e of virtue, conclude every one to be ill-natured who has any penetration, and look upon a di&s;tingui&s;hing judgment as want of tender|ne&s;s. But they &s;hould learn, that this di&s;cernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable tem|per, but from that long experience and thorough knowledge of the world, which lead the&s;e who have it, to &s;crutinize into the conduct and di&s;po&s;ition of men, before they tru&s;t entirely to tho&s;e fair appear|ances,

which &s;ometimes veil the mo&s;t in&s;idious pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>We are perpetually mi&s;taking the qualities and di&s;po&s;itions of our own hearts. We elevate our fail|ings into virtues, and qualify our vices into weak|ne&s;&s;es: and hence ari&s;e &s;o many fal&s;e judgments re|&s;pecting meekne&s;s. Self-ignorance is at the root of all this mi&s;chief. Many ladies complain, that, for their part, their &s;pirit is &s;o meek they can bear no|thing; whereas, if they &s;poke truth, they would &s;ay, their &s;pirit is &s;o high and unbroken, that they can bear nothing. Strange&punc; to plead their meekne&s;s as a rea&s;on why they cannot endure to be cro&s;&s;ed, and to produce their impatience of contradiction&punc; as a proof of their gentlene&s;s!</P>
<P>Meekne&s;s, like mo&s;t other virtues, has certain li|mits, which it no &s;ooner exceeds than it becomes criminal. Servility of &s;pirit is not gentlene&s;s, but weakne&s;s; and if allowed, under the &s;pecious ap|pearances it &s;ometimes puts on, will lead to the mo&s;t dangerous compliances. She who hears innocence maligned without vindicating it, fal&s;ehood a&s;&s;erted without contradicting it, or religion prophaned without re&s;enting it, is not gentle, but wicked.</P>
<P>To give up the cau&s;e of an innocent, injured friend, if the popular cry happens to be again&s;t him, is the mo&s;t di&s;graceful weakne&s;s. This was the ca&s;e of Madame de Maintenon. She loved the character and admired the talents of Racine; &s;he care&s;&s;ed him while he had no enemies, but wanted the greatne&s;s of mind, or rather the common ju&s;tice, to protect him again&s;t their re&s;entment, when he had; and her favourite was abandoned to the &s;u&s;picious jealou&s;y of the king, when a prudent remon&s;trance might have pre&s;erved him.&mdash;But her tamene&s;s, if not ab|&s;olute connivance in the great ma&s;&s;acre of the pro|te&s;tants, in who&s;e church &s;he had been bred, is a far more guilty in&s;tance of her weakne&s;s; an in&s;tance which, in &s;pite of all her devotional zeal and incom|parable prudence, will di&s;qualify her from &s;hining in the annals of good women, however &s;he may be
<PB N="48" REF="024452_0046_0FC7468F2CC95CD0">
entitled to figure among the great and the fortunate. Compare her conduct with that of her undaunted and pious countryman and cotemporary, Bougi, who, when Louis would have prevailed on him to renounce his religion for a commi&s;&s;ion or a government, no|bly replied, "If I could be per&s;uaded to betray my God for a mar&s;hal's &s;taff, I might betray my king for a bribe of much le&s;s con&s;equence."</P>
<P>Meekne&s;s is imperfect, if it be not both active and pa&s;&s;ive&mdash;if it will not enable us to &s;ubdue our own pa&s;&s;ions and re&s;entments, as well as qualify us to bear patiently the pa&s;&s;ions and re&s;entments of others.</P>
<P>Before we give way to any violent emotion of an|ger, it would, perhaps, be worth while to con&s;ider the value of the object which excites it, and to re|flect for a moment, whether the thing we &s;o ardent|ly de&s;ire, or &s;o vehemently re&s;ent, be really of as much importance to us, as that delightful tranquilli|ty of &s;oul, which we renounce in pur&s;uit of it. If, on a fair calculation, we find we are not likely to get as much as we are &s;ure to lo&s;e, then, putting all religious con&s;iderations out of the que&s;tion, common &s;en&s;e and human policy will tell us, we have made a fooli&s;h and unprofitable exchange. Inward quiet is a part of one's &s;elf; the object of our re&s;entment may be only a matter of opinion; and certainly, what makes a portion of our actual happine&s;s ought to be too dear to us, to be &s;acrificed for a trifling, foreign, perhaps imaginary good.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t pointed &s;atire I remember to have read, on a mind en&s;laved by anger, is an ob&s;ervation of Se|neca's. "Alexander," &s;aid he,
<Q>had two friends, Clitus and Ly&s;imachus; the one he expo&s;ed to a lion, the other to him&s;elf: he who was turned loo&s;e to the bea&s;t, e&s;caped; but Clitus was mur|dered: for he was turned loo&s;e to an angry man.</Q></P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;ionate woman's happine&s;s is never in her own keeping: it is the &s;port of accident, and the &s;lave of events. It is in the power of her acquaintance, her &s;ervants, but chiefly of her enemies; and all her comforts lie at the mercy of others. So far from
<PB N="49" REF="024452_0047_0FC7469306F50568">
being willing to learn of him who was meek and lowly, &s;he con&s;iders meekne&s;s as the want of a be|coming &s;pirit, and lowline&s;s as a de&s;picable and vul|gar meanne&s;s. And an imperious woman will &s;o lit|tle covet the ornament of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, that it is almo&s;t the only ornament &s;he will not be &s;o|licitous to wear. But re&s;entment is a very expen&s;ive vice. How dearly has it co&s;t its votaries, even from the &s;in of Cain, the fir&s;t offender in this kind! "It is cheaper (&s;ays a pious writer) to forgive, and &s;ave the charges."</P>
<P>If it were only for mere human rea&s;ons, it would turn to a better account to be patient: nothing de|feats the malice of an enemy like a &s;pirit of forbear|ance: the return of rage for rage cannot be &s;o effec|tually provoking. True gentlene&s;s, like an impene|trable armour, repels the mo&s;t pointed &s;hafts of ma|lice: they cannot pierce through this invulnerable &s;hield, but either fall hurtle&s;s to the ground, or re|turn, to wound the hand that &s;hot them.</P>
<P>A meek &s;pirit will not look out of it&s;elf for hap|pine&s;s, becau&s;e it finds a con&s;tant banquet at home; yet, by a &s;ort of divine alchymy, it will convert all external events to its own profit, and be able to deduce &s;ome good, even from the mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing; it will extract comfort and &s;atisfaction from the mo&s;t barren circum&s;tances:
<Q>It will &s;uck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.</Q></P>
<P>But the &s;upreme excellence of this complacent quality is, that it naturally di&s;po&s;es the mind where it re&s;ides, to the practice of every other that is amia|ble. Meekne&s;s may be called the pioneer of all the other virtues, which levels every ob&s;truction, and &s;mooths every difficulty that might impede their en|trance, or retard their progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The peculiar importance and value of this amiable virtue may be farther &s;een in its permanency. Ho|nours and dignities are tran&s;ient&mdash; beauty and riches frail and fugacious, to a proverb. Would not the truly wi&s;e, therefore, wi&s;h to have &s;ome one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on, which they might call their own in the &s;evere&s;t

<HEAD>Thoughts on the Cultivation of the Heart and Temper in the Education of Daughters.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE not the fooli&s;h pre&s;umption to imagine, that I can offer any thing new on a &s;ubject, which has been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully treated by many learned and able writers. I would only, with all po&s;&s;ible defe|rence, beg leave to hazard a few &s;hort remarks on that part of the &s;ubject of education, which I would call the <HI>education of the heart.</HI> I am well aware, that this part al&s;o has not been le&s;s &s;kilfully and forcibly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed than the re&s;t, though I cannot at the &s;ame time, help remarking, that it does not appear to have been &s;o much adopted into common practice.</P>
<P>It appears then, that notwith&s;tanding the great and real improvements, which have been made in the affair of female education, and notwith&s;tanding the more enlarged and generous views of it, which prevail in the pre&s;ent day, there is &s;till a very material defect, which it is not, in general, enough the object of attention to remove. This defect &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in this, that too little regard is paid to the di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>mind;</HI> that the indications of the <HI>temper</HI> are not properly cheri&s;hed; nor the affecti|ons of the <HI>heart</HI> &s;ufficiently regulated.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t education of girls, as far as the cu&s;toms, which fa&s;hion e&s;tabli&s;hes, are right, they &s;hould un|doubtedly be followed. Let the exterior be made a con&s;iderable object of attention; but let it not be the principal, let it not be the only one. Let the graces be indu&s;triou&s;ly cultivated; but let them not be cultivated at the expen&s;e of the virtues.&mdash;Let the arms, the head, the whole per&s;on be carefully poli&s;h|ed; but let not the heart be the only portion of the human anatomy, which &s;hall be totally overlooked.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="024452_0049_0FC746958A256D68">The neglect of this cultivation &s;eems to proceed as much from a bad ta&s;te, as fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a fal&s;e principle. The generality of people form their judgment of education by &s;light and &s;udden appearances, which is certainly a wrong way of determining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mu&s;ic, dancing, and languages, gratify tho&s;e who teach them, by perceptible and almo&s;t immediate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffects&punc; and when there happens to be no imbecility in the pupil, nor deficiency in the ma&s;ter, every &s;uperficial ob&s;erver can, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, judge of the progre&s;s. The effects of mo&s;t of the&s;e accompli&s;hments addre&s;s them&s;elves to the &s;en&s;es; and there are more who can &s;ee and hear, than there are, who can judge and reflect.</P>
<P>Per&s;onal perfection is not only more obvious, it is al&s;o more rapid; and even in very accompli&s;hed cha|racters, elegance u&s;ually precedes principle.</P>
<P>But the heart, that natural &s;eat of evil propen&s;ities, that little trouble&s;ome empire of the pa&s;&s;ions, is led to what is right by &s;low motions and imperceptible degrees. It mu&s;t be admoni&s;hed by reproof, and al|lured by kindne&s;s. Its livelie&s;t advances are frequent|ly impeded by the ob&s;tinacy of prejudice, and its brighte&s;t promi&s;es often ob&s;cured by the tempe&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion. It is &s;low in its acqui&s;ition of virtue, and reluctant in its approaches to piety.</P>
<P>There is another rea&s;on, which proves this mental cultivation to be more important, as well as more difficult, than any other part of education. In the u&s;ual fa&s;hionable accompli&s;hments, the bu&s;ine&s;s of ac|quiring them is almo&s;t always getting forwards, and one difficulty is conquered, before another is &s;uffer|ed to &s;how it&s;elf; for a prudent teacher will level the road his pupil is to pa&s;s and &s;mooth the inequa|lities which might retard her progre&s;s.</P>
<P>But in morals, (which &s;hould be the greate&s;t object con&s;tantly kept in view) the ta&s;k is far more diffi|cult. The unruly and turbulent de&s;ires of the heart are not &s;o obedient; one pa&s;&s;ion will &s;tart up, be|fore another is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The &s;ubduing Hercules cannot cut off the heads &s;o often as the prolific hydra

can produce them, nor fell the &s;tubborn Antaeus, &s;o fa&s;t as he can recruit his &s;trength, and ri&s;e in vigour|ous and repeated oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>If all the accompli&s;hments could be bought at the price of a &s;ingle virtue, the purcha&s;e would be infi|nitely dear! And, however &s;tartling it may &s;ound, I think it is, notwith&s;tanding, true, that the labours of a good and wi&s;e mother, who is anxious for her daughter's mo&s;t important intere&s;ts, will &s;eem to be at variance with tho&s;e of her in&s;tructors. She will, doubtle&s;s, rejoice at her progre&s;s in any polite art, but &s;he will rejoice with trembling:&mdash;humility and piety form the &s;olid and durable ba&s;is, on which &s;he wi&s;hes to rai&s;e the &s;uper&s;tructure of the accompli&s;h|ments; while the accompli&s;hments them&s;elves are frequently of &s;uch an un&s;teady nature, that if the foundation is not &s;ecured, in proportion as the build|ing is enlarged, it will be overloaded and de&s;troyed by tho&s;e very ornaments which were intended to embelli&s;h what they have contributed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">in.</P>
<P>The more o&s;ten&s;ible qualifications &s;hould be care|fully regulated, or they will be in danger of putting to flight the mode&s;t train of retreating virtues, which cannot &s;afely &s;ub&s;i&s;t before the bold eye of public ob&s;ervation, or bear the bolder tongue of im|pudent and audacious flattery. A tender mother cannot but feel an hone&s;t triumph, in contemplating tho&s;e excellencies in her daughter which de&s;erve ap|plau&s;e; but &s;he will al&s;o &s;hudder at the vanity which that applau&s;e may excite, and at tho&s;e hitherto un|known ideas which it may awaken.</P>

<P>One would be led to imagine, by the common mode of female education, that life con&s;i&s;ted of one uni|ver&s;al holiday, and that the only conte&s;t was, who &s;hould be be&s;t enabled to excel in the &s;ports and games that were to be celebrated on it.

But is it right to &s;pend &s;o large a portion of life without &s;ome prepa|ration for the bu&s;ine&s;s of living?

But as the world &s;eems to be very well ap|pri&s;ed of their importance, there is the le&s;s occa|&s;ion to in&s;i&s;t on their utility. Yet, though well-bred young women &s;hould learn to dance, &s;ing, recite, and draw, the end of a good education is not, that they may become dancers, &s;ingers, players, or pain|ters; its real object is to make them good daugh|ters, good wives, good mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, good members of &s;ociety, and good chri&s;tians. The above qualifica|tions, therefore, are intended to <HI>adorn</HI> their <HI>lei&s;ure,</HI> not to <HI>employ</HI> their <HI>lives;</HI> for an amiable and wi&s;e woman will always have &s;omething better to value her&s;elf on, than the&s;e advantages, which, however captivating, are &s;till but &s;ubordinate parts of a tru|ly excellent character.</P>
<P>But I am afraid parents them&s;elves &s;ometimes con|tribute to the error of which I am complaining.

<P>The be&s;t effects of a careful and religious educa|tion are often very remote: they are to be di&s;cover|ed in future &s;cenes, and exhibited in untried con|nexions.

<P>One great art of education con&s;i&s;ts in not &s;uffer|ing the feelings to become too acute by unnece&s;&s;ary awakening, nor too obtu&s;e by the want of exertion. The former renders them the &s;ource of calamity, and totally ruins the temper: while the latter blunts and deba&s;es them, and produces a dull, cold, and &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit.

<P>How cruel is it to extingui&s;h by neglect or un|kindne&s;s, the precious &s;en&s;ibility of an open temper, to chill the amiable glow of an ingenuous &s;oul, and to quench the bright flame of a noble and generous &s;pirit!

But every appearance of amiable &s;implicity, or of hone&s;t &s;hame, <HI>Nature's ha&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y con&s;cience,</HI> will be dear to &s;en&s;ible hearts; they will carefully cheri&s;h every &s;uch indication in a young female: for they will perceive, that it is this temper, wi&s;ely cultivat|ed, which will one day make her enamoured of the loveline&s;s of virtue, and the beauty of holine&s;s: from which &s;he will acquire a ta&s;te for the doctrines of re|ligion, and a &s;pirit to perform the duties of it. And tho&s;e, who wi&s;h to make her a&s;hamed of this charm|ing temper, and &s;eek to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s her of it, will, it is to be feared, give her nothing better in exchange.

<P>Prudence is not natural to children: they can, however, &s;ub&s;titute art in its &s;tead. But is it not much better, that a girl &s;hould di&s;cover the faults in|cident to her age, than conceal them under this dark and impenetrable veil? I could almo&s;t venture to a&s;&s;ert, that there is &s;omething more becoming in the very errors of nature, where they are undi&s;|gui&s;ed, than in the affectation of virtue it&s;elf, where the reality is wanting. And I am &s;o far from being an admirer of prodigies, that I am extremely apt

to &s;u&s;pect them; and am always infinitely better plea&s;ed with nature, in her more common modes of operation. The preci&s;e and premature wi&s;dom, which &s;ome girls have cunning enough to a&s;&s;ume, is of a more dangerous tendency than any of their na|tural failings can be; as it effectually covers tho&s;e &s;ecret bad di&s;po&s;itions, which, if they di&s;played thme&s;elves, might be rectified. The hypocri&s;y of a&s;|&s;uming virtues, which are not inherent in the heart, prevents the growth and di&s;clo&s;ure of tho&s;e real ones, which it is the great end of education to cul|tivate.</P>
<P>But if the natural indications of the temper are to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and &s;tifled, where are the diagno&s;|ties, by which the &s;tate of the mind is to be known? The wi&s;e Author of all things, who did nothing in vain, doubtle&s;s intended them as &s;ymptoms, by which to judge of the di&s;ea&s;es of the heart; and it is im|po&s;&s;ible di&s;ea&s;es &s;hould be cured before they are known. If the &s;tream be &s;o cut off, as to prevent communication, or &s;o choaked up as to defeat di&s;|covery, how &s;hall we ever reach the &s;ource, out of which are the i&s;&s;ues of life?</P>
<P>This cunning, which of all the different di&s;po&s;i|tions girls di&s;cover, is mo&s;t to be dreaded, is in|crea&s;ed by nothing &s;o much as by fear. If tho&s;e a|bout them expre&s;s violent and unrea&s;onable anger at every trivial offence, it will always promote this temper, and will very frequently create it, where there was a natural tendency to frankne&s;s. The in|di&s;creet tran&s;ports of rage, which many betray on every &s;light occa&s;ion, and the little di&s;tinction they make between venial errors and premeditated crimes, naturally di&s;po&s;e a child to conceal, what &s;he does not however care to &s;uppre&s;s. Anger in one will not remedy the faults of another; for how can an in&s;trument of &s;in cure &s;in? If a girl is kept in a &s;tate of perpetual and &s;lavi&s;h terror, &s;he will, perhaps, have artifice enough to conceal tho&s;e pro|pen&s;ities which &s;he knows are wrong, or tho&s;e ac|tions which &s;he thinks are mo&s;t obnoxious to puni&s;h|ment.

<P>But, though girls &s;hould not be treated with un|kindne&s;s, nor the fir&s;t openings of the pa&s;&s;ions blight|ed by cold &s;everity; yet I am of opinion, that young females &s;hould be accu&s;tomed, very early in life, to a certain degree of re&s;traint. The natural ca&s;t of character, and the moral di&s;tinctions between the &s;exes, &s;hould not be di&s;regarded, even in childhood. That bold, independent, enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, which is &s;o much admired in boys, &s;hould not, when it hap|pens to di&s;cover it&s;elf in the other &s;ex, be encourag|ed, but &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Girls &s;hould be taught to give up their opinions betimes, and not pertinaciou&s;ly to carry on a di&s;pute, even if they &s;hould know them|&s;elves to be in the right. I do not mean, that they &s;hould be robbed of the liberty of private judgment, but that they &s;hould by no means be encouraged to contract a contentious or contradictory turn. It is of the greate&s;t importance to their future happine&s;s, that they &s;hould acquire a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive temper, and a forbearing &s;pirit; for it is a le&s;&s;on which the world will not fail to make them frequently practi&s;e, when they come abroad into it; and they will not practi&s;e it the wor&s;e, for having learnt it the &s;ooner. The&s;e early re&s;traints, in the limitation here meant, are &s;o far from being an effect of cruelty, that they are the mo&s;t indubitable marks of affection, and are the more meritorious, as they are &s;evere trials of ten|derne&s;s. But all the beneficial effects, which a mo|ther can expect from this watchfulne&s;s, will be en|tirely defeated, if it is practi&s;ed occa&s;ionally, and not habitually, and if it ever appears to be u&s;ed to gratify caprice, ill-humour or re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who have children to educate, ought to be
<PB N="59" REF="024452_0057_0FC746BD38CC7760">
extremely patient: it is indeed a labour of love. They &s;hould reflect, that extraordinary talents are neither e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of &s;ociety, nor to the happine&s;s of individuals. If that had been the ca&s;e, the beneficent Father of the univer&s;e would not have made them &s;o rare. For it is as ea&s;y for an Almighty Creator to produce a Newton, as an ordinary man; and he could have made tho&s;e powers common which we now con&s;ider as wonderful, with|out any miraculous exertion of his omnipotence, if the exi&s;tence of many Newtons had been nece&s;&s;ary to the perfection of his wi&s;e and gracious plan.</P>
<P>Surely, therefore, there is more piety, as well as more &s;en&s;e, in labouring to improve the talents which children actually have, than in lamenting that they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;upernatural endowments, or an|gelic perfections. A pa&s;&s;age of lord Bacon's furni&s;h|es an admirable incitement for endeavouring to car|ry the amiable and chri&s;tian grace of charity to its farthe&s;t extent, in&s;tead of indulging an over-anxious care for more brilliant but le&s;s important acqui&s;iti|ons.
<Q>The de&s;ire of power in exce&s;s cau&s;ed the an|gels to fall; the de&s;ire of knowledge in exce&s;s cau&s;ed man to fall; but in charity is no exce&s;s; neither can men nor angels come into danger by it.</Q></P>
<P>A girl who has docility will &s;eldom be found to want under&s;tanding enough for all the purpo&s;es of a &s;ocial, a happy, and an u&s;eful life. And when we behold the tender hope of fond and anxious love, bla&s;ted by di&s;appointment, the defect will as often be di&s;covered to proceed from the neglect or the er|ror of cultivation, as from the natural temper; and tho&s;e who lament the evil, will &s;ometimes be found to have occa&s;ioned it.</P>
<P>It is as injudicious for parents to &s;et out with too &s;anguine a dependence on the merit of their children, as it is for them to be di&s;couraged at every repul&s;e.

for relaxing their attention, that it ought to be an additional motive for redoubling it. Tho&s;e, who hope to do a great deal, mu&s;t not expect to do every thing. If they know any thing of the malig|nity of &s;in, the blindne&s;s of prejudice, or the cor|ruption of the human heart, they will al&s;o know, that that heart will always remain, after the very be&s;t po&s;&s;ible education, full of infirmity and imper|fection. Extraordinary allowances, therefore, mu&s;t be made for the weakne&s;s of nature in this its weak|e&s;t &s;take. After much is done, much will remain to do, and much, very much, will &s;till be left un|done. For this regulation of the pa&s;&s;ions and affec|tions cannot be the work of education alone, without the concurrence of divine grace operating on the heart. Why then &s;hould parents repine, if their efforts are not always crowned with immediate &s;uc|ce&s;s? They &s;hould con&s;ider, that they are not educa|ting cherubs and &s;eraphs, but men and women&mdash; creatures, who at their be&s;t e&s;tate are altogether vanity: how little then can be expected from them in the weakne&s;s and imbecility of infancy! I have dwelt on this part of the &s;ubject the longer, becau&s;e I am certain that many, who have &s;et out with a warm and active zeal, have cooled on the very fir&s;t di&s;couragement, and have afterwards almo&s;t totally remitted their vigilance, through a criminal kind of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Great allowances mu&s;t be made for a profu&s;ion of gaiety, loquacity, and even indi&s;cretion in children, that there may be animation enough left to &s;upply an active and u&s;eful character, when the fir&s;t fer|mentation of the youthful pa&s;&s;ions is over, and the redundant &s;pirits &s;hall come to &s;ub&s;ide.</P>
<P>If it be true, as a con&s;ummate judge of human nature has ob&s;erved,
<Q>That not a vanity is given in vain,</Q>

of &s;ome neighbouring virtue. It cannot be violently bent, or unnaturally forced towards an object of a totally oppo&s;ite nature, but may be gradually inclin|ed towards a corre&s;pondent but &s;uperior affection. Anger, hatred, re&s;entment, and ambition, the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions which &s;hake and di&s;|tract the human &s;oul, may be led to become the mo&s;t active oppo&s;ers of &s;in, after having been its mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;truments. Our anger, for in&s;tance, which can never be totally &s;ubdued, may be made to turn again&s;t our&s;elves, for our weak and imper|fect obedience&mdash;our hatred, again&s;t every &s;pecies of vice&mdash;our ambition, which will not be di&s;carded, may be ennobled: it will not change its name, but its object; it will de&s;pi&s;e what it lately valued, nor be contented to gra&s;p at le&s;s than immortality.</P>
<P>Thus the joys, fears, hopes, de&s;ires, all the pa&s;&s;i|ons and affections, which &s;eparate in various cur|rents from the &s;oul, will, if directed into their pro|per channels, after having fertili&s;ed wherever they have flowed, return again to &s;well and enrich the parent &s;ource.</P>
<P>That the very pa&s;&s;ions which appear the mo&s;t un|controulable and unpromi&s;ing, may be intended in the great &s;cheme of Providence, to an&s;wer &s;ome im|portant purpo&s;e, is remarkably evidenced in the cha|racter and hi&s;tory of &s;aint Paul. A remark on this &s;ubject by an ingenious old Spani&s;h writer, which I will here take the liberty to tran&s;late, will better illu&s;trate my meaning.</P>
<P><Q>To convert the bittere&s;t enemy into the mo&s;t zealous advocate, is the work of God for the in|&s;truction of man.

<P>To win the pa&s;&s;ions, therefore, over to the cau&s;e of virtue, an&s;wers a much nobler end than their ex|tinction would po&s;&s;ibly do, even if that could be ef|fected. But it is their nature never to ob&s;erve a neu|trality; they are either rebels or auxilaries; and an enemy &s;ubdued is an ally obtained. If I may be allowed to change the allu&s;ion &s;o &s;oon, I would &s;ay, that the pa&s;&s;ions al&s;o re&s;emble fires, which are friend|ly and beneficial when under proper direction; but if &s;uffered to blaze without re&s;traint, they carry de|va&s;tation along with them, and, if totally extingui&s;h|ed, leave the benighted mind in a &s;tate of cold and comfortle&s;s inanity.</P>

For I never will believe that envy, though pa&s;&s;ed through all the mo|ral &s;trainers, can be refined into a virtuous emula|tion, or lying improved into an agreeable turn for innocent invention. Almo&s;t all the other pa&s;&s;ions may be made to take an amiable hue: but the&s;e two mu&s;t either be totally extirpated, or be always con|tented to pre&s;erve their original deformity, and to wear their native black.</P>

<P>VARIOUS are the rea&s;ons why the greater part of mankind cannot apply them&s;elves to arts or letters. Particular &s;tudies are only &s;uited to the capacities of particular per&s;ons.

by the narrowne&s;s of their education, and many by the &s;traitne&s;s of their fortune. The wi&s;dow of God is wonderfully manife&s;ted in this happy and well-ordered diver&s;ity, in the powers and proper|ties of his creatures; &s;ince by thus admirably &s;uit|ing the agent to the action, the whole &s;cheme of hu|man affairs is carried on with the mo&s;t agreeing and con&s;i&s;tent economy, and no cha&s;m is left for want of an object to fill it, exactly &s;uited to its nature.</P>
<P>But in the great and univer&s;al concerns of religion, both &s;exes, and all ranks, are equally intere&s;ted. The truly catholic &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity accommo|dates it&s;elf, with an a&s;toni&s;hing conde&s;cen&s;ion, to the circum&s;tances of the whole human race. It rejects none on account of their pecuniary wants, their per|&s;onal infirmities, or their intellectual deficiencies. No &s;uperiority of parts is the lea&s;t recommendation, nor is any depre&s;&s;ion of fortune the &s;malle&s;t objec|tion.

<P>The philo&s;ophical author of <HI>The defence of learn|ing</HI> ob&s;erves, that knowledge has &s;omething of venom and malignity in it, when taken without its proper corrective, and what that is, the in&s;pired &s;aint Paul teaches us, by placing it as the immediate antidote: <HI>Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</HI> Perhaps, it is the vanity of human wi&s;dom, uncha&s;ti&s;ed by this correcting principle, which has made &s;o many infi|dels. It may proceed from the arrogance of a &s;elf|&s;ufficient pride, that &s;ome philo&s;ophers di&s;dain to ac|knowledge their belief in a Being, who has judged proper to conceal from them the infinite wi&s;dom of his coun&s;els; who, (to borrow the lofty language of the man of Uz) refu&s;ed to con&s;ult them when he laid the foundations of the earth, when he &s;hut up the &s;ea with doors, and made the clouds the garment thereof.</P>
<P>A man mu&s;t be an infidel either from pride, preju|dice, or bad education: he cannot be one unawares, or by &s;urpri&s;e; for infidelity is not occa&s;ioned by &s;udden impul&s;e or violent temptation. He may be hurried by &s;ome vehement de&s;ire into an immoral ac|tion, at which he will blu&s;h in his cooler moments, and which he will lament, as the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d effect of a &s;pirit un&s;ubdued by religion: but infidelity is a calm, con|&s;iderate act, which cannot plead the weakne&s;s of the heart, or the &s;eduction of the &s;en&s;es. Even good men frequently fail in their duty through the infir|mities

of nature, and the allurements of the world; but the infidel errs on a plan, on a &s;ettled and deli|berate principle.</P>
<P>But though the minds of men are &s;ometimes fa|tally infected with this di&s;ea&s;e, either through un|happy prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or &s;ome of the other cau&s;es a|bove mentioned: yet I am unwilling to believe, that there is in nature &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly incongruous a be|ing, as a <HI>female infidel.</HI> The lea&s;t reflexion on the temper, the character, and the education of women, makes the mind revolt with horror from an idea &s;o improbable, and &s;o unnatural.</P>
<P>May I be allowed to ob&s;erve, that, in general, the minds of girls &s;eem more aptly prepared, in their early youth, for the reception of &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions, than tho&s;e of the other &s;ex, and that their le&s;s ex|po&s;ed &s;ituations, in more advanced life, qualify them better for the pre&s;ervation of them? The daughters (of good parents I mean) are often more carefully in&s;tructed in their religious duties, than the &s;ons, and this from a variety of cau&s;es. They are not &s;o &s;oon &s;ent from under the parental eye into the bu&s;|tle of the world, nor &s;o early expo&s;ed to the conta|gion of bad example: their hearts are naturally more flexible, &s;oft, and liable to any kind of impre&s;|&s;ion the forming hand may &s;tamp on them; and la&s;t|ly, as they do not receive the &s;ame cla&s;&s;ical educa|tion with boys, their feeble minds are not obliged at once to receive and &s;eparate the precepts of chri|&s;tianity, and the documents of pagan philo&s;ophy. The nece&s;&s;ity of doing this perhaps &s;omewhat wea|kens the &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions of young men, at lea&s;t till the under&s;tanding is formed, and confu&s;es their ideas of piety, by mixing them with &s;o much hetero|geneous matter. They only ca&s;ually read, or hear read, the &s;criptures of truth, while they are oblig|ed to learn by heart, con&s;true and repeat the poeti|cal fables of the le&s;s than human gods of the an|cients. And as the excellent author of <HI>The internal evidence of the chri&s;tian religion</HI> ob&s;erves,
<Q>Nothing has &s;o much contributed to corrupt the true &s;pirit
<PB N="66" REF="024452_0064_0FC746E082868F88">
of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution, as that partiality which we contract, in our earlie&s;t education, for the manners of pagan antiquity.</Q></P>
<P>Girls, therefore, who do <HI>not</HI> contract this early partiality, ought to have a clearer notion of their religious duties: they are not obliged, at an age when the judgment is &s;o weak, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the doctrines of Zeno, of Epicurus, and of Chri&s;t; and to embarra&s;s their minds with the various mo|rals which were taught in the <HI>porch,</HI> in the <HI>academy,</HI> and on the <HI>mount.</HI></P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed, that the&s;e remarks cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o mi&s;under&s;tood, as to be con&s;trued into the lea&s;t di&s;re&s;pect to literature, or a want of the highe&s;t re|verence for a learned education, the ba&s;is of all ele|gant knowledge: they are only intended, with all proper deference, to point out to young women, that however inferior their advantages of acquiring a knowledge of the belles-lettres are to tho&s;e of the other &s;ex; yet it depends on them&s;elves not to be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in this mo&s;t important of all &s;tudies, for which their abilities are equal, and their opportu|nities, perhaps, greater.</P>
<P>But the mere exemption from infidelity is &s;o &s;mall a part of the religious character, that I hope no one will attempt to claim any merit from this negative &s;ort of goodne&s;s, or value her&s;elf merely for not be|ing the very wor&s;t thing &s;he po&s;&s;ibly can be. Let no mi&s;taken girl fancy &s;he gives a proof of her wit by her want of piety, or that a contempt of things &s;e|rious and &s;acred will exalt her under&s;tanding, or rai&s;e her character even in the opinion of the mo&s;t avowed male infidels. For one may venture to af|firm, that with all their profligate ideas, both of wo|men and of religion, neither Bolingbroke, Wharton, Buckingham, nor even <HI>lord Che&s;terfield him&s;elf,</HI> would have e&s;teemed a woman the more for her being ir|religious.</P>
<P>With whatever ridicule a polite free-thinker may affect to treat religion him&s;elf, he will think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary his wife &s;hould entertain different notions of

it. He may pretend to de&s;pi&s;e it as a matter of opi|nion, depending on creeds and &s;y&s;tems; but, if he is a man of &s;en&s;e, he will know the value of it, as a governing principle, which is to influence her con|duct and direct her actions. If he &s;ees her unaffected|ly &s;incere in the practice of her religious duties, it will be a &s;ecret pledge to him, that &s;he will be equal|ly exact in fulfilling the conjugal; for he can have no rea&s;onable dependence on her attachment to <HI>him,</HI> if he has no opinion of her fidelity to GOD; for &s;he who neglects fir&s;t duties, gives but an indifferent proof of her di&s;po&s;ition to fill up inferior ones; and how can a man of any under&s;tanding, (whatever his own re|ligious profe&s;&s;ions may be) tru&s;t that women with the care of his family, and the education of his chil|dren, who wants her&s;elf the be&s;t incentive to a vir|tuous life, the belief that &s;he is an accountable crea|ture, and the reflexion that &s;he has an immortal &s;oul?</P>
<P>Cicero &s;poke it as the highe&s;t commendation of Cato's character, that he embraced philo&s;ophy, not for the &s;ake of <HI>di&s;puting</HI> like a philo&s;opher, but of <HI>living</HI> like one. The chief purpo&s;e of chri&s;tian know|ledge is to promote the great end of a chri&s;tian life. Every rational woman &s;hould, no doubt, be able to give a rea&s;on of the hope that is in her; but this knowledge is be&s;t acquired, and the duties con&s;e|quent on it be&s;t performed, by reading books of plain piety and practical devotion, and not by entering in|to the endle&s;s feuds, and engaging in the unprofita|ble contentions of partial controver&s;iali&s;ts. Nothing is more unamiable than the narrow &s;pirit of party zeal, nor more di&s;gu&s;ting than to hear a woman deal out judgments, and denounce vengeance again&s;t any one, who happens to differ from her in &s;ome opinion, perhaps of no real importance, and which, it is pro|bable, &s;he may be ju&s;t as wrong in rejecting, as the object of her cen&s;ure is in embracing. A furious and unmerciful female bigot wanders as far beyond the limits pre&s;cribed to her &s;ex, as a Thale&s;tris or a Joan d'Arc. Violent debate has made as few con|verts
<PB N="68" REF="024452_0066_0FC746E377E9CFF0">
as the &s;word, and both the&s;e in&s;truments are particularly unbecoming, when wielded by a female hand.</P>
<P>But though no one will be frightened out of their opinions, yet they may be per&s;uaded out of them: they may be touched by the affecting earne&s;tne&s;s of &s;erious conver&s;ation, and allured by the attractive beauty of a con&s;i&s;tently &s;erious life. And while a young woman ought to dread the name of a wrang|ling polemic, it is her duty to a&s;pire after the ho|nourable character of a &s;incere chri&s;tian. But this dignified character &s;he can by no means de&s;erve, if &s;he is ever afraid to avow her principles, or a&s;ham|ed to defend them. A profligate, who makes it a point to ridicule every thing which comes under the appearance of formal in&s;truction, will be di&s;con|certed at the &s;pirited yet mode&s;t rebuke of a pious young woman. But there is as much efficacy in the manner of reproving prophanene&s;s, as in the words. If &s;he corrects it with moro&s;ene&s;s, &s;he defeats the ef|fect of her remedy, by her un&s;kilful manner of ad|mini&s;tring it. If, on the other hand, &s;he affects to defend the in&s;ulted cau&s;e of God, in a faint tone of voice, and &s;tudied ambiguity of phra&s;e, or with an air of levity, and a certain expre&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure in her eyes, which proves &s;he is &s;ecretly delighted with what &s;he pretends to cen&s;ure, &s;he injures religion much more than he did, who publicly prophaned it; for &s;he plainly indicates, that &s;he either does not be|lieve, or does not re&s;pect what &s;he profe&s;&s;es. The other attacked it as an open foe; &s;he betrays it as a fal&s;e friend. No one pays any regard to the opi|nion of an avowed enemy: but the de&s;ertion or treachery of a profe&s;&s;ed friend, is dangerous in|deed!</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange notion, which prevails in the world, that religion only belongs to the old and the melan|choly, and that it is not worth while to pay the lea&s;t attention to it, while we are capable of attend|ing to any thing el&s;e. They allow it to be proper enough for the clergy, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, and for

the aged, who have not &s;pirits for any bu&s;ine&s;s at all. But till they can prove, that none except the clergy and aged <HI>die,</HI> it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that this is mo&s;t wretched rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Great injury is done to the intere&s;ts of religion, by placing it in a gloomy and unamiable light. It is &s;ometimes &s;poken of, as if it would actually make a hand&s;ome woman ugly, or a young one wrinkled. But can any thing be more ab&s;urd, than to repre|&s;ent the beauty of holine&s;s as the &s;ource of deformi|ty?</P>
<P>There are few, perhaps, &s;o entirely plunged in bu&s;ine&s;s, or ab&s;orbed in plea&s;ure, as not to intend, at &s;ome future time, to &s;et about a religious life in good earne&s;t. But then they con&s;ider it as a kind of <HI>dernier re&s;&s;ort,</HI> and think it prudent to defer flying to this di&s;agreeable refuge, till they have no reli&s;h left for any thing el&s;e. Do they forget, that to per|form this great bu&s;ine&s;s well, requires all the &s;trength of their youth, and all the vigour of their unimpair|ed capacities? To confirm this a&s;&s;ertion, they may ob&s;erve how much the &s;lighte&s;t indi&s;po&s;ition, even in the mo&s;t active &s;ea&s;on of life, di&s;orders every facul|ty, and di&s;qualifies them for attending to the mo&s;t ordinary affairs; and then let them reflect how lit|tle able they will be to tran&s;act the mo&s;t important of all bu&s;ine&s;s, in the moment of excruciating pain, or in the day of univer&s;al debility.</P>
<P>When the &s;en&s;es are palled with exce&s;&s;ive gratifica|tion&mdash;when the eye is tired with &s;eeing, and the ear with hearing&mdash;when the &s;pirits are &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unk, that the <HI>gra&s;shopper is become a burden</HI>&mdash;how &s;hall the blunted apprehen&s;ion be capable of under&s;tanding a new &s;cience, or the worn-out heart be able to reli&s;h a new plea&s;ure?</P>

But &s;he hopes that her ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire of exciting a ta&s;te for literature in young ladies, (which encouraged her to hazard the follow|ing remarks) will not OBSTRUCT her general de&s;ign, even if it does not actually PROMOTE it.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>GOOD <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> is as different from <HI>genius,</HI> as percep|tion is from invention; yet, though di&s;tinct qualities, they frequently &s;ub&s;i&s;t together. It is al|together oppo&s;ite to <HI>wit,</HI> but by no means incon|&s;i&s;tent with it. It is not &s;cience; for there is &s;uch a thing as unlettered good &s;en&s;e; yet, though it is neither wit, learning, nor genius, it is a &s;ub&s;titute for each, where they do not exi&s;t, and the perfection of all where they do.</P>
<P>Good &s;en&s;e is &s;o far from de&s;erving the apellation of <HI>common &s;en&s;e,</HI> by which it is frequently called, that it is perhaps one of the rare&s;t qualities of the human mind. If, indeed, this name is given it in re|&s;pect to its peculiar &s;uitablene&s;s to the purpo&s;es of common life, there is great propriety in it. Good &s;en&s;e appears to differ from ta&s;te, in this, that ta&s;te is an in&s;tantaneous deci&s;ion of the mind, a &s;udden reli&s;h of what is beautiful, or di&s;gu&s;t at what is de|fective, in an object, without waiting for the &s;lower confirmation of the judgment. Good &s;en&s;e is, per|haps, that confirmation, which e&s;tabli&s;hes a &s;udden|ly conceived idea, or feeling, by the powers of com|paring and reflecting. They differ al&s;o in this, that ta&s;te &s;eems to have a more immediate reference to arts, to literature, and to almo&s;t every object of the &s;en&s;es; while good &s;en&s;e ri&s;es to moral excellence,
<PB N="71" REF="024452_0069_0FC746F3E467DEB8">
and exerts its influence on life and manners. Ta&s;te is fitted to the perception and enjoyment of what|ever is beautiful in art or nature: good &s;en&s;e, to the improvement of the conduct, and the regulation of the heart.</P>
<P>Yet the term, good &s;en&s;e, is u&s;ed indi&s;criminately to expre&s;s either a fini&s;hed ta&s;te for letters, or an in|variable prudence in the affairs of life. It is &s;ome|times applied to the mo&s;t moderate abilities, in which ca&s;e, the expre&s;&s;ion is certainly too &s;trong: and at others to the mo&s;t &s;hining, when it is as much too weak and inadequate. A &s;en&s;ible man is the u&s;u|al, but unappropriated phra&s;e, for every degree in the &s;cale of under&s;tanding, from the &s;ober mortal, who obtains it by his decent demeanor and &s;olid dullne&s;s, to him who&s;e talents qualify him to rank with a Bacon, a Harris, or a John&s;on.</P>
<P>Genius is the power of invention and imitation. It is an incommunicable faculty: no art or &s;kill of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or can be&s;tow the &s;malle&s;t portion of it on another; no pains or labour can reach the &s;ummit of perfection, where the &s;eeds of it are wanting in the mind: yet it is capable of infinite improvement where it actually exi&s;ts, and is attended with the highe&s;t capacity of communicating in&s;truction, as well as delight to others.</P>
<P>It is the peculiar property of genius to &s;trike out great or beautiful things: it is the felicity of good &s;en&s;e not to do ab&s;urd ones. Genius breaks out in &s;plendid &s;entiments and elevated ideas: good &s;en&s;e confines its more circum&s;cribed, but perhaps more u&s;eful walk, within the limits of prudence and pro|priety.</P>

<P><PB N="72" REF="024452_0070_0FC746F5793A2198">This is, perhaps, the fine&s;t picture of human ge|nius that ever was drawn by a human pencil. It pre|&s;ents a living image of a creative imagination, or a power of inventing things which have no actual ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>With &s;uperficial judges, who, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, make up the greater part of the ma&s;s of mankind, talents are only liked or under&s;tood to a certain de|gree. Lofty ideas are above the reach of ordinary apprehen&s;ions: the vulgar allow tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them, to be in a &s;omewhat higher &s;tate of mind than them&s;elves; but of the va&s;t gulph which &s;eparates them, they have not the lea&s;t conception. They ac|knowledge a &s;uperiority; but of its extent they neither know the value, nor can conceive the reali|ty. It is true, the mind, as well as the eye, can take in objects larger than it&s;elf; but this is only true of great minds: for a man of low capacity, who con&s;iders a con&s;ummate genius, re&s;embles one, who &s;eeing a column for the fir&s;t time, and &s;tanding at too great a di&s;tance to take in the whole of it, concludes it to be flat; or, like one unacquainted with the fir&s;t principles of philo&s;ophy, who, finding the &s;en&s;ible horizon appear a plain &s;urface, can form no idea of the &s;pherical form of the whole, which he does not &s;ee, and laughs at the account of anti|podes, which he cannot comprehend.</P>
<P>Whatever is excellent is al&s;o rare; what is u&s;e|ful is more common. How many thou&s;ands are born qualified for the coar&s;e employments of life, for one who is capable of excelling in the fine arts! yet &s;o it ought to be; becau&s;e our natural wants are more numerous, and more importunate, than the intellec|tual.</P>
<P>Whenever it happens, that a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed talents has been drawn by mi&s;take, or precipitated by pa&s;&s;ion, into any dangerous indi&s;cretion; it is common for tho&s;e, who&s;e coldne&s;s of temper has &s;upplied the place, and u&s;urped the name, of pru|dence, to boa&s;t of their own &s;teadier virtue, and triumph in their own &s;uperior caution; only becau&s;e

they have never been a&s;&s;ailed by a temptation &s;trong enough to &s;urpri&s;e them into error. And with what a vi&s;ible appropriation of the character to them&s;elves, do they con&s;tantly conclude, with a cordial compli|ment to <HI>common &s;en&s;e!</HI> They point out the beauty and u&s;efulne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his quality &s;o forcibly and expli|citly, that you cannot po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;take who&s;e picture they are drawing with &s;o flattering a pencil. The unhappy man, who&s;e conduct has been &s;o feelingly arraigned, perhaps acted from good, though mi&s;tak|en motives&mdash;at lea&s;t, from motives of which his cen|&s;urer has not capacity to judge: but the event was unfavourable, nay the action might be really wrong, and the vulgar maliciou&s;ly take the opportunity of this &s;ingle indi&s;cretion, to lift them&s;elves nearer on a level with a character, which, except in this in&s;tance, has always thrown them at the mo&s;t di&s;graceful and mortifying di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The elegant biographer of Collins, in his affect|ing apology for that unfortunate genius, remarks,
<Q>That the gifts of imagination bring the heavie&s;t ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> on the vigilance of rea&s;on; and to bear tho&s;e fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lties with unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety, requires a degree of firmne&s;s, and of cool attention, which does not always attend the higher gifts of the mind: yet difficult as nature her&s;elf &s;eems to have rendered the ta&s;k of regu|larity to genius, it is the &s;upreme con&s;olation of dullne&s;s, and of folly, to point with gothic tri|umph to tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es which are the overflowing of faculties they never enjoyed.</Q></P>
<P>What the greater part of the world mean by com|mon &s;en&s;e, will be generally found, on a clo&s;er en|quiry, to be art, fraud, or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s! That &s;ort of &s;aving prudence which makes men extremely atten|tive to their own &s;afety, or profit&mdash;diligent in the pur&s;uit of their own plea&s;ures or intere&s;ts&mdash;and per|fectly at their ea&s;e as to what becomes of the re&s;t of mankind. Furious, where their own property is concerned, philo&s;ophers when nothing but the good of others is at &s;take, and perfectly re&s;igned under all calamities but their own.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="024452_0072_0FC746F8753C3838">When we &s;ee &s;o many accompli&s;hed wits of the pre&s;ent age, as remarkable for the decorum of their lives, as for the brilliancy of their writings, we may believe, that next to principle, it is owing to their <HI>good &s;en&s;e,</HI> which regulates and cha&s;ti&s;es their imginations. The va&s;t conceptions which enable a true genius to a&s;cend the &s;ublime&s;t heights, may be &s;o connected with the &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions, as to give it a natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l tendency to fly off from the &s;trait line of regular<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">; till good &s;en&s;e, acting on the fancy, makes it gravitate powerfully towards that virtue which is its proper centre.</P>
<P>Add to this, when it is con&s;idered with what im|perfection the divine wi&s;dom has thought fit to &s;tamp every thing human, it will be found, that ex|cellence and infirmity are &s;o in&s;eparably wound up in each other, that a man derives the &s;orene&s;s of temper, and irritability of nerve, which makes him unea&s;y to others, and unhappy in him&s;elf, from tho&s;e exqui&s;ite feelings, and that elevated pitch of thought, by which, as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, on a more &s;eri|ous occa&s;ion, he is, as it were, out of the body.</P>
<P>It is not a&s;toni&s;hing, therefore, when the &s;pirit is carried away by the magnificence of its own ideas,
<Q>Not touch'd, but rapt&mdash;not weaken'd, but in&s;pir'd,</Q>
that the frail body, which is the natural victim of pain, di&s;ea&s;e, and death, &s;hould not always be able to follow the mind in its a&s;piring flights, but &s;hould be as imperfect as if it belonged only to an ordinary &s;oul.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, might not providence intend to humble human pride, by pre&s;enting to our eyes &s;o mortify|ing a view of the weakne&s;s and infirmity of even his be&s;t work? Perhaps man, who is already but a little lower than the angels, might, like the revolted &s;pi|rits, totally have &s;haken off obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|on to his Creator, had not God wi&s;ely tempered hu|man excellence with a certain con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its own imperfection. But though this inevitable alloy of weakne&s;s may frequently be found in the be&s;t cha|racters,
<PB N="75" REF="024452_0073_0FC7471444E89398">
yet how can that be the &s;ource of triumph and exaltation to any, which, if properly weighed, mu&s;t be the deepe&s;t motive of humiliation to all? A good-natured man will be &s;o far from rejoicing, that he will be &s;ecretly troubled, whenever he reads that the greate&s;t Roman morali&s;t was tainted with avarice, and the greate&s;t Briti&s;h philo&s;opher with venality.</P>
<P>It is remarked by Pope, in his e&s;&s;ay on critici&s;m, that,
<Q>Ten cen&s;ure wrong, for one that writes ami&s;s.</Q>
But I apprehend it does not therefore follow, that to judge is more difficult than to write. If this were the ca&s;e, the critic would be &s;uperior to the poet, whereas it appears to be directly the contrary.
<Q>The critic, (&s;ays the great champion of Shake|&s;peare) but fa&s;hions the body of a work; the poet mu&s;t add the &s;oul, which gives force and direction to its actions and ge&s;tures.</Q>
It &s;hould &s;eem, that the rea&s;on why &s;o many more judge wrong, than write ill, is becau&s;e the number of readers is beyond all proportion greater than the number of writers. Every man who reads, is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a critic, and, with very common abilities, may point out real faults and material errors in a very well written book: but it by no means follows, that he is able to write any thing comparable to the work which he is capable of cen&s;uring. And unle&s;s the numbers of tho&s;e who write, and of tho&s;e who judge, were more equal, the calculation &s;eems not to be quite fair.</P>
<P>A capacity for reli&s;hing works of genius is the indubitable &s;ign of good ta&s;te. But if a proper di&s;|po&s;ition and ability to enjoy the compo&s;itions of o|thers, entitle a man to the claim of reputation, it is &s;till a far inferior degree of merit to his who can invent and produce tho&s;e compo&s;itions, the bare di&s;|qui&s;ition of which gives the critic no &s;mall &s;hare of fame.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident of the royal academy, in his admi|rable <HI>di&s;cour&s;e</HI> on <HI>imitation,</HI> has &s;et the folly of de|pending on una&s;&s;i&s;ted genius, in the cleare&s;t light;
<PB N="76" REF="024452_0074_0FC74715C82B4730">
and has &s;hown the nece&s;&s;ity of adding the knowledge of others, to our own native powers, in his u&s;ual &s;trik|ing and ma&s;terly manner. "The mind," &s;ays he,
<Q>is a barren &s;oil&mdash;is a &s;oil &s;oon exhau&s;ted, and will produce no crop, or only one, unle&s;s it be conti|nually fertilized, and enriched with foreign mat|ter.</Q></P>
<P>Yet it has been objected, that &s;tudy is a great ene|my to originality; but even if this were true, it would perhaps be as well that an author &s;hould give us the ideas of &s;till better writers, mixed and a&s;&s;imi|lated with the matter in his own mind, as tho&s;e crude and undige&s;ted thoughts, which he values under the notion that they are original. The &s;weete&s;t honey neither ta&s;tes of the ro&s;e, the honey-&s;uckle, nor the carnation, yet it is compounded of the very e&s;&s;ence of them all.</P>
<P>If in the other fine arts, this accumulation of know|ledge is nece&s;&s;ary, it is indi&s;pen&s;ably &s;o in poetry. It is a fatal ra&s;hne&s;s for any one to tru&s;t too much to his own &s;tock of ideas. He mu&s;t invigorate them by exerci&s;e, poli&s;h them by conver&s;ation, and in|crea&s;e them by every &s;pecies of elegant and virtuous knowledge, and the mind will not fail to reproduce with intere&s;t tho&s;e &s;eeds, which are &s;own in it by &s;tudy and ob&s;ervation. Above all, let every one guard again&s;t the dangerous opinion, that he knows enough: an opinion that will weaken the energy and reduce the powers of the mind, which, though once perhaps vigorous and effectual, will be &s;unk to a &s;tate of literary imbecility, by cheri&s;hing vain and pre&s;umptuous ideas of its own independence.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, it may not be nece&s;&s;ary that a poet &s;hould be deeply &s;killed in the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem; but it mu&s;t be allowed, that a general acquaintance with plants and flowers will furni&s;h him with a delight|ful and profitable &s;pecies of in&s;truction.

portion of philo&s;ophical knowledge is requi&s;ite to the completion of his literary character. The &s;ciences are more independent, and require little or no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the graces of poetry: but poetry, if &s;he would charm and in&s;truct, mu&s;t not be &s;o haugh|ty; &s;he mu&s;t be contented to borrow of the &s;ciences, many of her choice&s;t allu&s;ions; and many of her mo&s;t graceful embelli&s;hments; and does it not magnify the character of true poe&s;y, that &s;he includes with|in her&s;elf all the &s;cattered graces of every &s;eparate art?</P>
<P>The rules of the great ma&s;ters in critici&s;m may not be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the forming a good ta&s;te, as the examination of tho&s;e original mines from whence they drew their trea&s;ures of knowledge.</P>
<P>The three celebrated e&s;&s;ays on the art of poetry do not teach &s;o much by their laws as by their ex|amples; the dead letter of their rules is le&s;s in&s;truc|tive than the living &s;pirit of their ver&s;e. Yet the&s;e rules are to a young poet, what the &s;tudy of loga|rithms is to a young mathematician; they do not &s;o much contribute to form his judgment, as afford him the &s;atisfaction of convincing him that he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> right. They do not preclude the difficulty of the operation; but at the conclu&s;ion of it, furni&s;h him with a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ller demon&s;tration that he has proceeded on proper principles. When he has well &s;tudied the ma&s;ters in who&s;e &s;chools the fir&s;t critics formed them|&s;elves, and fancies he has caught a &s;park of their divine flame, it may be a good method to try his own compo&s;itions by the te&s;t of the critic rules, &s;o far, indeed, as the mechani&s;m of poetry goes. If the examination be fair and candid, this trial, like the touch of Ithuriel's &s;pear, will detect every la|tent error, and bring to light every favourite fail|ing.</P>
<P>Good ta&s;te always &s;uits the mea&s;ure of its admira|tion to the merit of the compo&s;ition it examines. It accommodates its prai&s;es, or its cen&s;ure, to the ex|cellence of a work, and appropriates it to the nature of it. General applau&s;e, or indi&s;criminate abu&s;e, is
<PB N="78" REF="024452_0076_0FC7472043266968">
the &s;ign of a vulgar under&s;tanding. There are certain blemi&s;hes which the judicious and good-natured read|er will candidly overlook. But the fal&s;e &s;ublime, the tumour which is intended for greatne&s;s, the di&s;torted figure, the puerile conceit, and the incongruous meta|phor, the&s;e are defects for which &s;carcely any other kind of merit can atone. And yet there may be more hope of a writer (e&s;pecially if he be a young one) who is now and then guilty of &s;ome of the&s;e faults, than of one who avoids them all, not through judgment, but feeblene&s;s, and who, in&s;tead of deviating into er|ror, is continually falling &s;hort of excellence. The mere ab&s;ence of error implies that moderate and in|ferior degree of merit with which a cold heart and a phlegmatic ta&s;te will be better &s;atisfied than with the magnificent irregularities of exalted &s;pirits. It &s;tretches &s;ome minds to an unea&s;y exten&s;ion, to be o|bliged to attend to compo&s;itions &s;uperlatively excel|lent; and it contracts liberal &s;ouls to a painful nar|rowne&s;s to de&s;cend to books of inferior merit. A work of capital genius, to a man of an ordinary mind, is the bed of Procru&s;tes to one of a &s;hort &s;tature; the man is too little to fill up the &s;pace a&s;&s;igned him, and undergoes the torture in attempting it: and a mode|rate, or low production to a man of bright talents, is the puni&s;hment inflicted by Mezentius; the living &s;pirit has too much animation to endure patiently to be in contact with a dead body.</P>
<P>Ta&s;te &s;eems to be a &s;entiment of the &s;oul, which gives the bias to opinion; for we feel before we re|flect. Without this &s;entiment, all knowledge, learn|ing, and opinion, would be cold, inert materials; whereas they become active principles when &s;tirred, kindled, and inflamed by this animating quality.</P>
<P>There is another feeling, which is called enthu&s;i|a&s;m. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;en&s;ible hearts is &s;o &s;trong, that it only yields to the impul&s;e with which &s;trik|ing objects act on it; but &s;uch hearts help on the effect by their own &s;en&s;ibility. In a &s;cene where Shake&s;peare and Garrick give perfection to each o|ther, the feeling heart does not merely accede to
<PB N="79" REF="024452_0077_0FC74721B5699D50">
the delirium they occa&s;ion: it does more; it is ena|moured of it; it &s;olicits the delu&s;ion; it &s;ues to be deceived, and grudgingly cheri&s;hes the &s;acred trea|&s;ure of its feelings. The poet and performer con|cur in carrying us
<Q>Beyond this vi&s;ible diurnal &s;phere.</Q>
They bear us aloft in their airy cour&s;e, with unre|&s;i&s;ted rapidity, if they meet not with any ob&s;truction from the coldne&s;s of our own feelings. Perhaps on|ly a few fine &s;pirits can enter into the detail of their writing and acting: but the multitude do not enjoy le&s;s acutely, becau&s;e they are not able philo&s;ophi|cally to analy&s;e the &s;ources of their joy or &s;orrow. If the others have the advantage of judging, the&s;e have at lea&s;t the privilege of feeling: and it is not from complai&s;ance to a few leading judges, that they bur&s;t into peals of laughter, or melt into delightful agony; their hearts decide, and that is a deci&s;ion from which there lies no appeal. It mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that the nicer &s;eparations of character, and the lighter and almo&s;t imperceptible &s;hades which &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;h them, will not be intimately reli&s;hed, unle&s;s there be a con&s;onancy of ta&s;te as well as feeling in the &s;pectators; though, where the pa&s;|&s;ions are principally concerned, the prophane vul|gar come in for a larger portion of the univer&s;al de|light, than critics and connoi&s;&s;eurs are willing to allow them.</P>
<P>Yet enthu&s;ia&s;m, though the natural concomitant of genius, is no more genius it&s;elf, than drunkenne&s;s is cheerfulne&s;s: and that enthu&s;ia&s;m, which di&s;covers it&s;elf on occa&s;ions not worthy to excite it, is the mark of a wretched judgment and a fal&s;e ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Nature produces innumerable objects: to imitate them, is the province of genius; to direct tho&s;e imi|tations, is the property of judgment; to decide on their effects, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of ta&s;te. For ta&s;te, who &s;its as &s;upreme judge on the productions of genius, is not &s;atisfied when &s;he merely imitates nature; &s;he mu&s;t al&s;o, &s;ays an ingenious French writer, imitate
<PB N="80" REF="024452_0078_0FC747233830F2E0">
<HI>beautiful</HI> nature. It requires no le&s;s judgment to re|ject than to choo&s;e, and genius might imitate what is vulgar, under pretence that it was natural, if ta&s;te did not carefully point out tho&s;e objects which are mo&s;t proper for imitation. It al&s;o requires a very nice di&s;cernment to di&s;tingui&s;h veri&s;imilitude from truth; for there is a truth in ta&s;te nearly as conclu|&s;ive as demon&s;tration in mathematics.</P>
<P>Genius, when in full impetuo&s;ity of its career, of|ten touches on the very brink of error; and is, per|haps, never &s;o near the verge of the precipice, as when indulging its &s;ublime&s;t flights. It is in tho&s;e great, but dangerous moments, that the curb of vigi|lant judgment is mo&s;t wanting: while &s;afe and &s;o|ber dulne&s;s ob&s;erves one tedious and in&s;ipid round of tire&s;ome uniformity, and &s;teers equally clear of ec|centricity and of beauty. Dulne&s;s has few redundan|cies to retrench, few luxuriancies to pru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and few irregularities to &s;mooth. The&s;e, though errors, are the errors of genius, for there is rarely redundancy without plenitude, or irregularity without greatne&s;s. The exce&s;&s;es of genius may ea&s;ily be retrenched, but the deficiencies of dulne&s;s can never be &s;upplied.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who copy from others, will doubtle&s;s be le&s;s excellent than tho&s;e who copy from nature. To imitate imitators, is the way to depart too far from the great original her&s;elf. The later copies of an en|graving retain fainter and fainter traces of the &s;ub|ject, to which the earlier impre&s;&s;ions bore &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>It &s;eems very extraordinary, that it &s;hould be the mo&s;t difficult thing in the world to be natural; and that it &s;hould be harder to hit off the manners of real life, and to delineate &s;uch characters as we con|ver&s;e with every day, than to imagine &s;uch as do not exi&s;t. But caricature is much ea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r than an exact outline&mdash;and the colouring of fancy le&s;s difficult than that of truth.</P>
<P>People do not always know what ta&s;te they have, till it is awakened by &s;ome corre&s;ponding object; nay, genius it&s;elf is a fire, which in many minds
<PB N="81" REF="024452_0079_0FC7472DCF18CEA0">
would never blaze, if not kindled by &s;ome external cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Nature, that munificent mother, when &s;he be&s;tows the power of judging, accompanies it with the ca|pacity of enjoying. The judgment, which is clear &s;ighted, points out &s;uch objects as are calculated to in&s;pire love; and the heart in&s;tantaneou&s;ly attaches it&s;elf to what&s;oever is lovely.</P>
<P>In regard to literary reputation, a great deal de|pends on the &s;tate of learning in the particular age or nation, in which an author lives. In a dark and ignorant period, moderate knowledge will entitle its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to a con&s;iderable &s;hare of fame; whereas, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in a polite and lettered age, requires &s;triking parts and deep erudition.</P>
<P>When a nation begins to emerge from a &s;tate of mental darkne&s;s, and to &s;trike out the fir&s;t rudiments of improvement, it chalks out a few &s;trong but incor|rect &s;ketches, gives the rude out-lines of general art, and leaves the filling up to the lei&s;ure of happier days, and the refinement of more enlightened times. Their drawing is a rude <HI>Sbozzo,</HI> and their poetry wild min&s;trel&s;y.</P>
<P>Perfection of ta&s;te is a point which a nation no &s;ooner reaches, than it over&s;hoots; and it is more difficult to return to it, after having pa&s;&s;ed it, than it was to attain, when they fell &s;hort of it. Where the arts begin to langui&s;h after having flouri&s;hed, they &s;eldom, indeed, fall back to their original bar|bari&s;m: but a certain feeblene&s;s of exertion takes place, and it is more difficult to recover them from this dying languor to their proper &s;trength, than it was to poli&s;h them from their former r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dene&s;s; for it is a le&s;s formidable undertaking, to refine barbari|ty, than to &s;top decay: the fir&s;t may be laboured in|to elegance; but the latter will rarely be &s;trength|ened into vigour.</P>
<P>Ta&s;te exerts it&s;elf at fir&s;t but feebly and imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|fectly; it is repre&s;&s;ed and kept back by a croud of the mo&s;t di&s;couraging prejudices: like an infant prince, who, though born to reign, yet holds an idle &s;cep|tre,
<PB N="82" REF="024452_0080_0FC7474082A477C8">
which he has not power to u&s;e, but is obliged to &s;ee with the eyes, and hear through the ears of o|ther men.</P>
<P>A writer of correct ta&s;te will hardly ever go out of his way, even in &s;earch of embelli&s;hment; he will &s;tudy to attain the be&s;t end by the mo&s;t natural means; for he knows that what is not natural cannot be beau|tiful, and that nothing can be beautiful out of its own place; for an improper &s;ituation will convert the mo&s;t &s;triking beauty into a glaring defect. When, by a well-connected chain of ideas, or a judicious &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events, the reader is &s;natched to
<Q>Thebes or Athens,</Q>
what can be more impertinent than for the poet to ob&s;truct the operation of the pa&s;&s;ion he has ju&s;t been kindling, by introducing a conceit which contradicts his purpo&s;e, and interrupts his bu&s;i|ne&s;s! Indeed, we cannot be tran&s;ported, even in idea, to tho&s;e places, if the poet does not manage &s;o a|droitly as not to make us &s;en&s;ible of the journey: the in&s;tant we feel we are travelling, the writer's art fails, and the delirium is at an end.</P>
<P>Pro&s;erpine, &s;ays Ovid, would have been re&s;tored to her mother Ceres, had not A&s;calaphus &s;een her &s;top to gather a golden apple, when the terms of her re|&s;toration were, that &s;he &s;hould ta&s;te nothing. A &s;to|ry pregnant with in&s;truction for lively writers, who, by neglecting the main bu&s;ine&s;s, and going out of the way for fal&s;e gratifications, lo&s;e &s;ight of the end they &s;hould principally keep in view. It was this fal&s;e ta&s;te that introduced the numberle&s;s <HI>concetti,</HI> which di&s;grace the brighte&s;t of the Italian poets; and this is the rea&s;on, why the reader only feels &s;hort and in|terrupted &s;natches of delight, in peru&s;ing the bril|liant but unequal compo&s;itions of Ario&s;to, in&s;tead of that unbroken and undimini&s;hed plea&s;ure, which he con&s;tantly receives from Virgil, from Milton, and ge|nerally from Ta&s;&s;o. The fir&s;t mentioned Italian is the Atalanta, who will interrupt the mo&s;t eager ca|reer, to pick up the glittering mi&s;chief; while the Mantuan and the Briti&s;h bards, like Hippomenes, pre&s;s on warm in the pur&s;uit, and un&s;educed by temptation.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="024452_0081_0FC74742083CB038">A writer of real ta&s;te will take great pains in the perfection of his &s;tyle, to make the reader believe that he took none at all. The writing, which ap|pears to be mo&s;t ea&s;y, will be generally found to be lea&s;t imutable. The mo&s;t elegant ver&s;es are the mo&s;t ea&s;ily retained; they fa&s;ten them&s;elves on the me|mory, without its making any effort to pre&s;erve them, and we are apt to imagine, that what is re|membered with ea&s;e, was written without difficulty.</P>
<P>To conclude: genius is a rare and precious gem, of which few know the worth; it is fitter for the ca|binet of the connoi&s;&s;eur, than for the commerce of mankind. Good &s;en&s;e is a bank-bill, convenient for change, negociable at all times, and current in all places. It knows the value of &s;mall things, and con|&s;iders that an aggregate of them makes up the &s;um of human affairs. It elevates common concerns into matters of importance, by performing them in the be&s;t manner, and at the mo&s;t &s;uitable &s;ea&s;on. Good &s;en&s;e carries with it the idea of equality, while genius is always &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to impo&s;e the burden of &s;uperiority; and re&s;pect is paid to it with that re|luctance which always attends other impo&s;ts, the low|er orders of mankind generally repining mo&s;t at de|mands, by which they are lea&s;t liable to be affected.</P>
<P>As it is the character of genius to penetrate with a lynx's beam into unfathomable aby&s;&s;es and uncre|ated worlds, and to &s;ee what is <HI>not,</HI> &s;o it is the pro|perty of good &s;en&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h perfectly, and judge accurately what realy <HI>is.</HI> Good &s;en&s;e has not &s;o piercing an eye, but it has as clear a &s;ight. It does not penetrate &s;o deeply, but as far as it <HI>does</HI> &s;ee, it di&s;cerns di&s;tinctly. Good &s;en&s;e is a judicious mecha|nic, who can produce beauty and convenience out of &s;uitable means; but genius (I &s;peak with reverence of the immea&s;urable di&s;tance) bears &s;ome remote re|&s;emblance to the divine architect, who produced per|fection of beauty without any vi&s;ible materials, <HI>who &s;pake, and it was created;</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>let it be, and it was.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the &s;ub&s;equent letters were written by a tender father, in a declining &s;tate of health, for the in&s;truction of his daughters, and not intended for the public, is a circum&s;tance which will recom|mend them to every one who con&s;iders them in the light of admonition and advice. In &s;uch dome&s;tic intercour&s;e, no &s;acrifices are made to prejudices, to cu&s;toms, to fa&s;hionable opinions. Paternal love, pa|ternal care, &s;peak their genuine &s;entiments, undi&s;|gui&s;ed and unre&s;tained. A father's zeal for his daugh|ter's improvement, in whatever can make a woman amiable, with a father's quick apprehen&s;ion of the dangers that too often ari&s;e, even from the attain|ment of that very point, &s;ugge&s;t his admonitions, and render him attentive to a thou&s;and little graces and decorums, which would e&s;cape the nice&s;t morali&s;t who &s;hould undertake the &s;ubject on unintere&s;ted &s;pecu|lation. Every faculty is on the alarm, when the objects of &s;uch tender affection are concerned.</P>
<P>In the writer of the&s;e letters, paternal tenderne&s;s and vigilance were doubled, as he was at that time &s;ole parent; death having before deprived the young

ladies of their excellent mother. His own precari|ous &s;tate of health in&s;pired him with the mo&s;t tender &s;olicitude for their future welfare; and though he might have concluded, that the impre&s;&s;ions made by his in&s;tructions and uniform example could never be effaced from the memory of his children, yet his anxiety for their orphan condition &s;ugge&s;ted to him this method of continuing to them tho&s;e advantages.</P>
<P>The editor is encouraged to offer this treati&s;e to the public, by the very favourable reception which the re&s;t of his father's works have met with. The comparative view of the &s;tate of man and other ani|mals, and the e&s;&s;ay on the office and duties of a phy|&s;ician, have been very generally read; and, if he is not deceived by the partiality of his friends, he has rea&s;on to believe they have met with general approbation.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of tho&s;e tracts, the author's object was to improve the ta&s;te and under&s;tanding of his reader; in others, to mend his heart; in others, to point out to him the proper u&s;e of philo&s;ophy, by &s;howing its application to the duties of common life. In all his writings, his chief view was the good of his fellow-creatures; and as tho&s;e among his friends, in who&s;e ta&s;te and judgment he mo&s;t confided, think the pub|lication of this &s;mall work will contribute to that general de&s;ign, and at the &s;ame time do honour to his memory, the editor can no longer he&s;itate to comply with their advice, in communicating it to the public.</P>

<HEAD>Introduction.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear girls,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU had the misfortune to be deprived of your mo|ther at a time of life when you were in&s;en&s;ible of your lo&s;s, and could receive little benefit either from her in&s;truction or her example. Before this comes to your hands, you will likewi&s;e have lo&s;t your fa|ther.</P>
<P>I have had many melancholy reflexions on the for|lorn
<PB N="87" REF="024452_0084_0FC747487729B058">
and helple&s;s &s;ituation you mu&s;t be in, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to remove me from you, before you ar|rive at that period of life, when you will be able to think and act for your&s;elves. I know mankind too well; I know their fal&s;ehood, their di&s;&s;ipation, their coldne&s;s to all the duties of friend&s;hip and humanity. I know the little attention paid to helple&s;s infancy. You will meet with few friends di&s;intere&s;ted enough to do you good offices, when you are incapable of making them any return, by contributing to their in|tere&s;t or their plea&s;ure, or even to the gratification of their vanity.</P>
<P>I have been &s;upported under the gloom naturally ari&s;ing from the&s;e reflexions, by a reliance on the goodne&s;s of that providence which has hitherto pre|&s;erved you, and given me the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of the goodne&s;s of your di&s;po&s;itions; and by the &s;ecret hope, that your mother's virtues will entail a ble&s;|&s;ing on her children.</P>
<P>The anxiety I have for your happine&s;s, has made me re&s;olve to throw together my &s;entiments relat|ing to your future conduct in life. If I live for &s;ome years, you will receive them with much greater ad|vantage, &s;uited to your different geniu&s;es and di&s;po|&s;itions. If I die &s;ooner, you mu&s;t receive them in this very imperfec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> manner,&mdash;the la&s;t proof of my af|fection.</P>
<P>You will all remember your father's fondne&s;s, when perhaps every other circum&s;tance relating to him is forgotten. This remembrance, I hope, will induce you to give a &s;erious attention to the advices I am now going to leave with you. I can reque&s;t this at|tention with the greater confidence, as my &s;enti|ments, on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting points that regard life and manners, were entirely corre&s;pondent to your mother's, who&s;e judgment and ta&s;te I tru&s;ted much more than my own.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t expect that the advices which I &s;hall give you, will be very imperfect, as there are many name|le&s;s delicacies in female manners, of which none but a woman can judge. You will have one advantage
<PB N="88" REF="024452_0085_0FC74749C6F16B88">
by attending to what I am going to leave with you; you will hear, at lea&s;t for once in your lives, the genuine &s;entiments of a man who has no intere&s;t in flattering or deceiving you. I &s;hall throw my reflex|ions together without any &s;tudied order, and &s;hall only, to avoid confu&s;ion, range them under a few ge|neral heads.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee, in a little treati&s;e of mine ju&s;t pub|li&s;hed, in what an honourable point of view I have con&s;idered your &s;ex,&mdash;not as dome&s;tic drudges, or the &s;laves of our plea&s;ures, but as our companions and equals&mdash;as de&s;igned to &s;often our hearts and po|li&s;h our manners&mdash;and, as Thom&s;on finely &s;ays,
<Q><L>To rai&s;e the virtues, animate the bli&s;s,</L>
<L>And &s;weeten all the toils of human life.</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not repeat what I have there &s;aid on this &s;ubject, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that from the view I have given of your natural character and place in &s;ociety, there ari&s;es a certain propriety of conduct, peculiar to your &s;ex. It is this peculiar propriety of female manners, of which I intend to give you my &s;entiments, without touching on tho&s;e general rules of conduct by which men and women are equally bound.</P>
<P>While I explain to you that &s;y&s;tem of conduct which I think will tend mo&s;t to your honour and happine&s;s, I &s;hall, at the &s;ame time, endeavour to point out tho&s;e virtues and accompli&s;hments which render you mo&s;t re&s;pectable and mo&s;t amiable in the eyes of my own &s;ex.</P>

<HEAD>Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the duties of religion, &s;trictly &s;peaking, are equally binding on both &s;exes, yet certain differences in their natural character and education, render &s;ome vices in your &s;ex particularly odious. The natural hardne&s;s of our hearts, and &s;trength of our pa&s;&s;ions, inflamed by the uncontrouled licence we are too often indulged with in our youth, are apt to render our manners more di&s;&s;olute, and make us le&s;s

&s;u&s;ceptible of the finer feelings of the heart. Your &s;uperior delicacy, your mode&s;ty, and the u&s;ual &s;eve|rity of your education, pre&s;erve you, in a great mea|&s;ure, from any temptation to tho&s;e vices to which we are mo&s;t &s;ubjected. The natural &s;oftne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibi|lity of your di&s;po&s;itions particularly fit you for the practice of tho&s;e duties where the heart is chiefly con|cerned. And this, along with the natural warmth of your imagination, renders you peculiarly &s;u&s;cep|tible of the feelings of devotion.</P>
<P>There are many circum&s;tances in your &s;ituation that peculiarly require the &s;upports of religion, to enable you to act in them with &s;pirit and propriety. Your whole life is often a life of &s;uffering. You can|not plunge into bu&s;ine&s;s, or di&s;&s;ipate your&s;elves in plea&s;ure and riot, as men too often do, when under the pre&s;&s;ure of misfortunes. You mu&s;t bear your &s;orrows in &s;ilence, unknown and unpitied. You mu&s;t often put on a face of &s;erenity and cheerfulne&s;s, when your hearts are torn with angui&s;h, or &s;inking in de&s;|pair. Then your only re&s;ource is in the con&s;olations of religion. It is chiefly owing to the&s;e, that you bear dome&s;tic misfortunes better than we do.</P>
<P>But you are &s;ometimes in very different circum|&s;tances, that equally require the re&s;traints of religi|on. The natural vivacity, and perhaps the natural vanity of your &s;ex, is very apt to lead you into a di&s;&s;ipated &s;tate of life, that deceives you under the appearance of innocent plea&s;ure; but which in reality wa&s;tes your &s;pirits, impairs your health, weakens all the &s;uperior faculties of your minds, and often &s;ullies your reputations. Religion, by checking this di&s;&s;i|pation, and rage for plea&s;ure, enables you to draw more happine&s;s, even from tho&s;e very &s;ources of amu&s;ement, which, when too frequently applied to, are often productive of &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Religion is rather a matter of &s;entiment than rea|&s;oning. The important and intere&s;ting articles of faith are &s;ufficiently plain. Fix your attention on the&s;e, and do not meddle with controver&s;y. If you get into that, you plunge into a chaos, from which
<PB N="90" REF="024452_0087_0FC74754E9068870">
you will never be able to extricate your&s;elves. It &s;poils the temper, and, I &s;u&s;pect, has no good effect on the heart.</P>
<P>Avoid all books and all conver&s;ations that tend to &s;hake your faith on tho&s;e great points of religion which &s;hould &s;erve to regulate your conduct, and on which your hopes of future and eternal happine&s;s de|pend.</P>
<P>Never indulge your&s;elves in ridicule on religious &s;ubjects, nor give countenance to it in others by &s;eem|ing diverted with what they &s;ay. This, to people of good-breeding, will be a &s;ufficient check.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you to go no further than the &s;criptures for your religious opinions. Embrace tho&s;e you find clear|ly revealed. Never perplex your&s;elves about &s;uch as you do not under&s;tand, but treat them with &s;ilent and becoming reverence. I would advi&s;e you to read on|ly &s;uch religious books as are addre&s;&s;ed to the heart, &s;uch as in&s;pire pious and devout affections, &s;uch as are proper to direct you in your conduct, and not &s;uch as tend to entangle you in the endle&s;s maze of opini|ons and &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>Be punctual in the &s;tated performance of your pri|vate devotions, morning and evening. If you have any &s;en&s;ibility or imagination, this will e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch an intercour&s;e between you and the Supreme Being, as will be of infinite con&s;equence to you in life. It will communicate an habitual cheerfulne&s;s to your tempers, give a firmne&s;s and &s;teadine&s;s to your virtue, and enable you to go through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of human life with propriety and dignity.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you to be regular in your attendance on pub|lic wor&s;hip, and in receiving the communion. Allow nothing to interrupt your public or private devotions, except the performance of &s;ome active duty in life, to which they &s;hould always give place. In your be|haviour at public wor&s;hip, ob&s;erve an exemplary at|tention and gravity.</P>
<P>That extreme &s;trictne&s;s which I recommend to you in the&s;e duties, will be con&s;idered by many of your acquaintance as a &s;uper&s;titious attachment to forms;

<P>Do not make religion a &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ect of common conver|&s;ation in mixed companies. When it is introduced, rather &s;eem to decline it.

<P>Cultivate an enlarged charity for all mankind, how|ever they may differ from you in their religious opi|nions.

<P>The be&s;t effect of your religion will be a diffu&s;ive humanity to all in di&s;tre&s;s. Set apart a certain pro|portion of your income as &s;acred to charitable pur|po&s;es.

<P>Do not confine your charity to giving money. You may have many opportunities of &s;howing a tender and

There is a fal&s;e and unnatural refinement in &s;en|&s;ibility, which makes &s;ome people &s;hun the &s;ight of e|very object in di&s;tre&s;s. Never indulge this, e&s;pecial|ly where your friends or acquaintances are concern|ed. Let the days of their misfortunes, when the world forgets or avoids them, be the &s;ea&s;on for you to exerci&s;e your humanity and friend&s;hip. The &s;ight of human mi&s;ery &s;oftens the heart, and makes it bet|ter: it checks the pride of health and pro&s;perity, and the di&s;tre&s;s it occa&s;ions, is amply compen&s;ated by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing your duty, and by the &s;ecret endearment which nature has annexed to all our &s;ym|pathetic &s;orrows.</P>
<P>Women are greatly deceived, when they think they recommend them&s;elves to our &s;ex, by their in|difference about religion. Even tho&s;e men who are them&s;elves unbelievers, di&s;like infidelity in you.

<HEAD>Conduct and Behaviour.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the chief beauties, in a female character, is that mode&s;t re&s;erve, that retiring delicacy, which avoids the public eye, and is di&s;concerted even at the gaze of admiration. I do not wi&s;h you to be in&s;en&s;ible to applau&s;e; if you were, you mu&s;t become, if not wor&s;e, at lea&s;t le&s;s amiable women: but you may be dazzled by that admiration which yet rejoi|ces your hearts.</P>
<P>When a girl cea&s;es to blu&s;h, &s;he has lo&s;t the mo&s;t powerful charm of beauty. That extreme &s;en&s;ibility which it indicates, may be a weakne&s;s and incum|brance in our &s;ex, as I have too often felt, but in yours it is peculiarly engaging. Pedants, who think them&s;elves philo&s;ophers, a&s;k why a woman &s;hould blu&s;h, when &s;he is con&s;cious of no crime? It is a &s;uf|ficient an&s;wer, that nature has made you to blu&s;h when you are guilty of no fault, and has forced us to love you, becau&s;e you do &s;o.&mdash;Blu&s;hing is &s;o far from be|ing nece&s;&s;arily an attendant on guilt, that it is the u&s;ual companion of innocence.</P>
<P>This mode&s;ty, which I think &s;o e&s;&s;ential in your &s;ex, will naturally di&s;po&s;e you to be rather &s;ilent in com|pany, e&s;pecially in a large one.&mdash;People of &s;en&s;e and di&s;cernment will never mi&s;take &s;uch &s;ilence for dull|ne&s;s.

&s;hows it, and this never e&s;capes an ob&s;erving eye.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad that you had an ea&s;y dignity in your behaviour at public places, but not that confi|dent ea&s;e, that unaba&s;hed countenance, which &s;eems to &s;et the company at defiance. If, while a gentle|man is &s;peaking to you, one of &s;uperior rank addre&s;|&s;es you, do not let your eager attention and vi&s;ible preference betray the flutter of your heart: let your pride on this occa&s;ion pre&s;erve you from that mean|ne&s;s, into which your vanity would &s;ink you. Con|&s;ider that you expo&s;e your&s;elves to the ridicule of the company, and affront one gentleman only to &s;well the triumph of another, who perhaps thinks he does you honour in &s;peaking to you.</P>
<P>Conver&s;e with men even of the fir&s;t rank with that dignified mode&s;ty which may prevent the approach of the mo&s;t di&s;tant familiarity, and con&s;equently pre|vent them from feeling them&s;elves your &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>Wit is the mo&s;t dangerous talent you can po&s;&s;e&s;s. It mu&s;t be guarded with great di&s;cretion and good nature; otherwi&s;e it will create you many enemies. Wit is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy; yet they are &s;eldom found united. Wit is &s;o flatter|ing to vanity, that they who po&s;&s;e&s;s it, become in|toxicated, and lo&s;e all &s;elf-command.</P>
<P>Humour is a different quality. It will make your company much &s;olicited; but be cautious how you indulge it. It is often a great enemy to delicacy, and a &s;till greater one to dignity of character. It may &s;ometimes gain you applau&s;e, but will never procure you re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Be even cautious of di&s;playing your good &s;en&s;e. It will be thought you a&s;&s;ume a &s;uperiority over the re&s;t of the company. But if you happen to have any learning, keep it a profound &s;ecret, e&s;pecially from the men, who generally look with a jealous and ma|lignant eye on a woman of great parts, and a culti|vated under&s;tanding.</P>

<P>Beware of detraction, e&s;pecially where your own &s;ex are concerned. You are generally accu&s;ed of be|ing particularly addicted to this vice&mdash;I think, un|ju&s;tly. Men are equally guilty of it when their in|tere&s;ts interfere. As your intere&s;ts more frequently cla&s;h, and as your feelings are quicker than ours, your temptations to it are more frequent: for this rea&s;on be particularly tender of the reputation of your own &s;ex, e&s;pecially when they happen to rival you in our regard. We look on this as the &s;tronge&s;t proof of dignity and true greatne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>Show a compa&s;&s;ionate &s;ympathy to unfortunate wo|men, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are rendered &s;o by the villainy of men. Indulge a &s;ecret plea&s;ure, I may &s;ay pride, in being the friends and refuge of the unhap|py, but without the vanity of &s;howing it.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider every &s;pecies of indelicacy in conver&s;a|tion, as &s;hameful in it&s;elf, and as highly di&s;gu&s;ting to us. All double entendre is of this &s;ort. The di&s;&s;o|lutene&s;s of men's education allows them to be divert|ed with a kind of wit, which yet they have delicacy enough to be &s;hocked at, when it comes from your mouths, or even when you hear it without pain and contempt.&mdash;Virgin purity is of &s;uch a delicate na|ture, that it cannot bear certain things without con|tamination. It is always in your power to avoid the&s;e. No man, but a brute or a fool, will in&s;ult a woman with conver&s;ation which he &s;ees gives her pain; nor will he dare to do it, if &s;he re&s;ent the in|jury with a becoming &s;pirit. There is a dignity in con&s;cious virtue, which is able to awe the mo&s;t &s;hame|le&s;s and abandoned of men.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="024452_0093_0FC7477F7888E298">You will be reproached perhaps with prudery.

<P>The men will complain of your re&s;erve. They will a&s;&s;ure you, that a franker behaviour would make you more amiable. But, tru&s;t me, they are not &s;in|cere when they tell you &s;o. I acknowledge, that on &s;ome occa&s;ions it might render you more agreeable as companions, but it would make you le&s;s amiable as women&mdash;an important di&s;tinction, which many of your &s;ex are not aware of. After all, I wi&s;h you to have great ea&s;e and openne&s;s in your conver&s;ation; I only point out &s;ome con&s;iderations which ought to regulate your behaviour in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Have a &s;acred regard to truth. Lying is a mean and de&s;picable vice. I have known &s;ome women of excellent parts, who were &s;o much addicted to it, that they could not be tru&s;ted in the relation of any &s;tory, e&s;pecially if it contained any thing of the mar|vellous, or if they them&s;elves were the heroines of the tale. This weakne&s;s did not proceed from a bad heart, but was merely the effect of vanity, or an un|bridled imagination. I do not mean to cen&s;ure that lively embelli&s;hment of a humourous &s;tory, which is only intended to promote innocent mirth.</P>
<P>There is a certain gentlene&s;s of &s;pirit and man|ners extremely engaging in your &s;ex&mdash;not that indi&s;criminate attention, that unmeaning &s;imper, which &s;miles on all alike. This ari&s;es either from an affectation of &s;oftne&s;s, or from perfect in&s;ipidi|ty.</P>
<P>There is a &s;pecies of refinement in luxury, ju&s;t be|ginning to prevail among the gentlemen of this coun|try, to which our ladies are yet as great &s;trangers as any women upon earth; I hope, for the honour of the &s;ex, that they may ever continue &s;o; I mean, the luxury of eating. It is a de&s;picable, &s;elfi&s;h vice in men; but in your &s;ex it is beyond expre&s;&s;ion indeli|cate and di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="024452_0094_0FC74781002C0588">Every one, who remembers a few years back, is &s;en&s;ible of a very &s;triking change in the attention and re&s;pect formerly paid by the gentlemen to the ladies: their drawing-rooms are de&s;erted: and after dinner and &s;upper, the gentlemen are impatient till they retire. How they came to lo&s;e this re&s;pect, which nature and politene&s;s &s;o well entitle them to, I &s;hall not here particularly enquire. The revolu|tions of manners in any country depend on cau&s;es very various and complicated. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the behaviour of the ladies in the la&s;t age was very re&s;erved and &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely. It would now be reckoned ridiculou&s;ly &s;tiff and formal. Whatever it was, it had certainly the effect of making them more re|&s;pected.</P>
<P>A fine woman, like other fine things in nature, has her proper point of view, from which &s;he may be &s;een to mo&s;t advantage. To fix this point requires great judgment, and an intimate knowledge of the human heart. By the pre&s;ent mode of female man|ners, the ladies &s;eem to expect that they &s;hall regain their acendency over us&mdash;by the fulle&s;t di&s;play of their per&s;onal charms&mdash;by being always in our eye at public places&mdash;by conver&s;ing with us, with the &s;ame unre&s;erved freedom as we do with one another &mdash;in &s;hort, by re&s;embling us as nearly as they po&s;&s;i|bly can.&mdash;But a little time and experience will &s;how the folly of this expectation and conduct.</P>
<P>The power of a fine woman over the hearts of men, of men of the fine&s;t parts, is even beyond what &s;he conceives. They are &s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ing illu&s;ion; but they cannot, nor do they wi&s;h to di&s;&s;olve it. But if &s;he is determined to di&s;pel the charm, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> certainly is in her power; &s;he may &s;oon reduce the angel to a very ordinary girl.</P>

<P>Let me now recommend to your attention that elegance, which is not &s;o much a quality it&s;elf, as the high poli&s;h of every other. It is what diffu&s;es an ineffable grace over every look, every motion, every &s;entence you utter; it gives that charm to beauty, without which it generally fails to plea&s;e. It is partly a per&s;onal quality, in which re&s;pect it is the gift of nature; but I &s;peak of it principally as a quality of the mind. In a word, it is the per|fection of ta&s;te in life and manners&mdash;every virtue and every excellency in their mo&s;t graceful and amiable forms.</P>
<P>You may perhaps think, that I want to throw eve|ry &s;park of nature out of your compo&s;ition, and to make you entirely artificial. Far from it.

<P>Some amu&s;ements are conducive to health; as vari|ous kinds of exerci&s;e: &s;ome are connected with qua|lities really u&s;eful; as different kinds of women's

work, and all the dome&s;tic concerns of a family: &s;ome are elegant accompli&s;hments; as dre&s;s, dancing, mu&s;ic, and drawing. Such books as improve your under&s;tanding, enlarge your knowledge, and cultivate your ta&s;te, may be con&s;idered in a higher point of view than mere amu&s;ements. There are a variety of others, which are neither u&s;eful nor ornamental, &s;uch as play of different kinds.</P>
<P>I would particularly recommend to you tho&s;e exer|ci&s;es that oblige you to be much abroad in the open air, &s;uch as walking, and riding on hor&s;eback. This will give vigour to your con&s;titutions, and a bloom to your complexions. If you accu&s;tom your&s;elves to go abroad always in chairs and carriages, you will &s;oon become &s;o enervated, as to be unable to go out of doors without them. They are, like mo&s;t articles of luxury, u&s;eful and agreeable when judiciou&s;ly u&s;ed; but, when made habitual, they become both in&s;ipid and pernicious.</P>
<P>An attention to your health is a duty you owe to your&s;elves and to your friends. Bad health &s;eldom fails to have an influence on the &s;pirits and temper. The fine&s;t geniu&s;es, the mo&s;t delicate minds, have very frequently a corre&s;pondent delicacy of bodily con&s;titution, which they are too apt to neglect. Their luxury lies in reading and late hours, equal enemies to health and beauty.</P>

<P>The dome&s;tic economy of a family is entirely a woman's province, and furni&s;hes a variety of &s;ubjects for the exertion both of good &s;en&s;e and good ta&s;te.

<P>I am at the greate&s;t lo&s;s what to advi&s;e you in re|gard to books. There is no impropriety in your reading hi&s;tory, or cultivating any art or &s;cience to which genius or accident lead you. The whole vo|lume of nature lies open to your eye, and furni&s;hes an infinite variety of entertainment. If I was &s;ure that nature had given you &s;uch &s;trong principles of ta&s;te and &s;entiment as would remain with you, and influence your future conduct, with the utmo&s;t plea|&s;ure would I endeavour to direct your reading in &s;uch a way as might form that ta&s;te to the utmo&s;t perfec|tion of truth and elegance.

as your hearts &s;o thoroughly approve, that you would not forego them for any con&s;ideration this world could offer.</P>
<P>Dre&s;s is an important article in female life. The love of dre&s;s is natural to you, and therefore it is proper and rea&s;onable. Good &s;en&s;e will regulate your expen&s;e in it; and good ta&s;te will direct you to dre&s;s in &s;uch a way, as to conceal any blemi&s;hes, and &s;et off your beauties, if you have any, to the greate&s;t advantage. But much delicacy and judgment are required in the application of this rule. A fine wo|man &s;hows her charms to mo&s;t advantage, when &s;he &s;eems mo&s;t to conceal them. The fine&s;t bo&s;om in na|ture is not &s;o fine as what imagination forms. The mo&s;t perfect elegance of dre&s;s appears always the mo&s;t ea&s;y, and the lea&s;t &s;tudied.</P>
<P>Do not confine your attention to dre&s;s to your pub|lic appearances. Accu&s;tom your&s;elves to an habitual neatne&s;s, &s;o that in the mo&s;t carele&s;s undre&s;s, in your mo&s;t unguarded hours, you may have no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of your appearance. You will not ea&s;ily believe how much we con&s;ider your dre&s;s as expre&s;&s;ive of your characters. Vanity, levity, &s;lovenline&s;s, fol|ly, appear through it. An elegant &s;implicity is an equal proof of ta&s;te and delicacy.</P>
<P>In dancing, the principal points you are to attend to, are ea&s;e and grace. I would have you to dance with &s;pirit; but never allow your&s;elves to be &s;o far tran&s;ported with mirth, as to forget the delicacy of your &s;ex. Many a girl dancing in the gaiety and in|nocence of her heart, is thought to di&s;cover a &s;pirit &s;he little dreams of.</P>
<P>I know no entertainment that gives &s;uch plea&s;ure to any per&s;on of &s;entiment or humour, as the theatre. But I am &s;orry to &s;ay, there are few Engli&s;h comedies a lady can &s;ee, without a &s;hock to delicacy. You will not readily &s;u&s;pect the comments gentlemen make on your behaviour on &s;uch occa&s;ions. Men are often be&s;t acquainted with the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of your &s;ex, and from them too readily form their judgment of the re&s;t. A virtuous girl often hears very indelicate

Yet this is, mo&s;t ungenerou&s;ly, a&s;cribed to that command of features, and that ready pre&s;ence of mind, which you are thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s in a degree far beyond us&punc; or, by &s;till more malignant ob&s;ervers, it is a&s;cribed to hardened effrontery.</P>
<P>Sometimes a girl laughs with all the &s;implicity of un&s;u&s;pecting innocence, for no other rea&s;on but being infected with other people's laughing: &s;he is then be|lieved to know more than &s;he &s;hould do. If &s;he does happen to under&s;tand an improper thing, &s;he &s;uffers a very complicated di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he feels her mode&s;ty hurt in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner, and at the &s;ame time is a&s;hamed of appearing con&s;cious of the injury. The only way to avoid the&s;e inconveniencies, is never to go to a play that is particularly offen&s;ive to delicacy. Tragedy &s;ubjects you to no &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s. Its &s;orrows will &s;often and ennoble your hearts.</P>
<P>I need &s;ay little about gaming, the ladies in this country being as yet almo&s;t &s;trangers to it. It is a ruinous and incurable vice; and as it leads to all the &s;elfi&s;h and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions, is peculiarly odious in your &s;ex. I have no objection to your playing a little at any kind of game, as a variety in your amu&s;ements, provided that what you can po&s;&s;ibly lo&s;e is &s;uch a trifle as can neither intere&s;t you, nor hurt you.</P>
<P>In this, as well as in all important points of con|duct, &s;how a determined re&s;olution and &s;teadine&s;s. This is not in the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent with that &s;oftne&s;s and gentlene&s;s &s;o amiable in your &s;ex. On the con|trary, it gives that &s;pirit to a mild and &s;weet di&s;po&s;i|tion, without which it is apt to degenerate into in&s;ipidity. It makes you re&s;pectable in your own eyes, and dignifies you in ours.</P>

&s;teady friend&s;hip. A happy c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oice of friends will be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to you, as they may a&s;&s;i&s;t you by their advice and good offices. But the imme|diate gratification which friend&s;hip affords to a warm, open, and ingenuous heart, is of it&s;elf a &s;ufficient motive to court it.</P>
<P>In the choice of your friends, have your principal regard to goodne&s;s of heart and fidelity. If they al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s ta&s;te and genius, that will &s;till make them more agreeable and u&s;eful companions. You have particular rea&s;on to place confidence in tho&s;e who have &s;hown affection for you in your early days, when you were incapable of making them any return. This is an obligation for which you cannot be too grateful. When you read this, you will naturally think of your mother's friend, to whom you owe &s;o much.</P>
<P>If you have the good fortune to meet with any who de&s;erve the name of friends, unbo&s;om your&s;elves to them with the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;picious confidence. It is one of the world's maxims, never to tru&s;t any per|&s;on with a &s;ecret, the di&s;covery of which could give you any pain: but it is the maxim of a little mind and a cold heart, unle&s;s where it is the effect of fre|quent di&s;appointments and bad u&s;age. An open tem|per, if re&s;trained but by tolerable prudence, will make you, on the whole, much happier than a re|&s;erved, &s;u&s;picious one, although you may &s;ometimes &s;uffer by it. Coldne&s;s and di&s;tru&s;t are but the too certain con&s;equences of age and experience: but they are unplea&s;ant feelings, and need not be anticipated before their time.</P>
<P>But however open you may be in talking of your affairs, never di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecret of one friend to an|other. The&s;e are &s;acred depo&s;its, which do not be|long to you, nor have you any right to make u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>There is another ca&s;e, in which I &s;u&s;pect it is pro|per to be &s;ecret, not &s;o much from motives of pru|dence, as delicacy; I mean in love matters. Though a woman has no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of an attach|ment
<PB N="104" REF="024452_0101_0FC73DAFB6438A60">
to a man of merit, yet nature, who&s;e authority is &s;uperior to philo&s;ophy, has annexed a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame to it. It is even long before a woman of deli|cacy dares avow to her own heart that &s;he loves; and when all the &s;ubterfuges of ingenuity to conceal it from her&s;elf fail, &s;he feels a violence done both to her pride and to her mode&s;ty. This, I &s;hould ima|gine, mu&s;t always be the ca&s;e where &s;he is not &s;ure of a return to her attachment.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;ituation, to lay the heart open to any per&s;on whatever, does not appear to me con&s;i&s;tent with the perfection of female delicacy. But perhaps I am in the wrong. At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t tell you, that, in point of prudence, it concerns you to attend well to the con&s;equences of &s;uch a di&s;covery. The&s;e &s;ecrets, however important in your own e&s;ti|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion, may apper very trifling to your friend, who po&s;&s;ibly will not enter into your feelings, but may rather con&s;ider them as a &s;ubject of plea&s;antry. For this rea&s;on, love &s;ecrets are of all others the wor&s;t kept. But the con&s;equences to you may be very &s;e|rious, as no man of &s;pirit and delicacy ever valued a heart much hacknied in the ways of love.</P>
<P>If, therefore, you mu&s;t have a friend to pour out your heart to, be &s;ure of her honour and &s;ecrecy. Let her not be a married woman, e&s;pecially if &s;he lives happily with her hu&s;band. There are certain unguarded moments, in which &s;uch a woman, though the be&s;t and worthie&s;t of her &s;ex, may let hints e&s;|cape, which, at other times, or to any other per&s;on than her hu&s;band, &s;he would be incapable of; nor will a hu&s;band in this ca&s;e feel him&s;elf under the &s;ame obligation of &s;ecrecy and honour, as if you had put your confidence originally in him&s;elf, e&s;pecially on a &s;ubject which the world is apt to treat &s;o lightly.</P>
<P>If all other circum&s;tances are equal, there are ob|vious advantages in your making friends of one ano|ther. The ties of blood, and your being &s;o much united in one common intere&s;t, form an additional bond of union to your friend&s;hip. If your brothers &s;hould have the good fortune to have hearts &s;u&s;cepti|ble
<PB N="105" REF="024452_0102_0FC73DB135CC3F50">
of friend&s;hip, to po&s;&s;e&s;s truth, honour, &s;en&s;e, and delicacy of &s;entiment, they are the fitte&s;t and mo&s;t unexceptionable confidants. By placing confidence in them, you will receive every advantage which you could hope for from the friend&s;hip of men, without any of the inconveniencies that attend &s;uch connexi|ons with our &s;ex.</P>
<P>Beware of making confidants of your &s;ervants. Dignity not properly under&s;tood very readily degene|rates into pride, which enters into no friend&s;hip, be|cau&s;e it cannot bear an equal, and is &s;o fond of flat|tery as to gra&s;p at it even from &s;ervants and depen|dants. The mo&s;t intimate confidants, therefore, of proud people, are valets-de-chambre and waiting wo|men. Show the utmo&s;t humanity to your &s;ervants; make their &s;ituation as comfortable to them as po&s;&s;i|ble: but if you make them your confidants, you &s;poil them, and deba&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Never allow any per&s;on, under the pretended &s;anc|tion of friend&s;hip, to be &s;o familiar as to lo&s;e a pro|per re&s;pect to you. Never allow them to teaze you on any &s;ubject that is di&s;agreeable, or where you have once taken your re&s;olution. Many will tell you, that this re&s;erve is incon&s;i&s;tent with the freedom which friend&s;hip allows: but a certain re&s;pect is as nece&s;|&s;ary in friend&s;hip as in love. Without it you may be liked as a child, but you will never be beloved as an equal.</P>
<P>The temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the heart in your &s;ex make you enter more readily and warmly into friend&s;hips than men. Your natural propen&s;ity to it is &s;o &s;trong, that you often run into intimacies which you &s;oon have &s;ufficient cau&s;e to repent of; and this makes your friend&s;hips &s;o very fluctuating.</P>
<P>Another great ob&s;tacle to the &s;incerity, as well as &s;teadine&s;s of your friend&s;hips, is the great cla&s;hing of your intere&s;ts, in the pur&s;uits of love, ambition, or vanity. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, it would appear, at fir&s;t view, more eligible for you to contract your friend|&s;hips with the men. Among other obvious advan|tages of an ea&s;y intercour&s;e between the two &s;exes,
<PB N="106" REF="024452_0103_0FC73DB870373B30">
it occa&s;ions an emulation and exertion in each to ex|cel and be agreeable; hence their re&s;pective excel|lencies are mutually communicated and blended. As their intere&s;ts in no degree interfere, there can be no foundation for jealou&s;y, or &s;u&s;picion of rival&s;hip. The friend&s;hip of a man for a woman is always blended with tenderne&s;s, which he never feels for one of his own &s;ex, even where love is in no degree concerned. Be&s;ides, we are con&s;cious of a natural title you have to our protection and good offices, and therefore we feel an additional obligation of honour to &s;erve you, and to ob&s;erve an inviolable &s;ecrecy, whenever you confide in us.</P>
<P>But apply the&s;e ob&s;ervations with great caution. Thou&s;ands of women of the be&s;t hearts and fine&s;t parts have been ruined by men who approach them under the &s;pecious name of friend&s;hip. But &s;uppo&s;ing a man to have the mo&s;t undoubted honour, yet his friend&s;hip to a woman is &s;o near a-kin to love, that if &s;he be very agreeable in her per&s;on, &s;he will probably very &s;oon find a lover, where &s;he only wi&s;hed to meet a friend. Let me here, however, warn you again&s;t that weakne&s;s &s;o common among vain women&mdash;the ima|gination, that every man, who takes particular notice of you, is a lover. Nothing can expo&s;e you more to ridicule than the taking up a man on the &s;u&s;picion of being your lover, who perhaps never once thought of you in that view, and giving your&s;elves tho&s;e airs &s;o common among all &s;illy women on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>There is a kind of unmeaning gallantry much prac|ti&s;ed by &s;ome men, which, if you have any di&s;cern|ment, you will find really very harmle&s;s. Men of this &s;ort will attend you to public places, and be u&s;e|ful to you by a number of little ob&s;ervances, which tho&s;e of a &s;uperior cla&s;s do not &s;o well under&s;tand, or have not lei&s;ure to regard, or perhaps are too proud to &s;ubmit to. Look on the compliments of &s;uch men as words of cour&s;e, which they repeat to every agreeable woman of their acquaintance. There is a familiarity they are apt to a&s;&s;ume, which a pro|per dignity in your behaviour will be ea&s;ily able to check.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="024452_0104_0FC73DBB60D1F658">There is a different &s;pecies of men whom you may like as agreeable companions, men of worth, ta&s;te, and genius, who&s;e conver&s;ation, in &s;ome re&s;pects, may be &s;uperior to what you generally meet with among your own &s;ex. It will be fooli&s;h in you to deprive your&s;elves of an u&s;eful and agreeable acquain|tance, merely becau&s;e idle people &s;ay he is your lover. Such a man may like your company, without having any de&s;ign on your per&s;on.</P>
<P>People who&s;e &s;entiments, and particularly who&s;e ta&s;tes corre&s;pond, naturally like to a&s;&s;ociate together, although neither of them have the mo&s;t di&s;tant view of any further connexion. But as this &s;imilarity of minds often gives ri&s;e to a more tender attachment than friend&s;hip, it will be prudent to keep a watchful eye over your&s;elves, le&s;t your hearts become too far engaged before you are aware of it. At the &s;ame time, I do not think that your &s;ex, at lea&s;t in this part of the world, have much of that &s;en&s;ibility which di&s;|po&s;es to &s;uch attachments. What is commonly called love among you is rather gratitude, and a partiality to the man who prefers you to the re&s;t of your &s;ex; and &s;uch a man you often marry, with little of either per&s;onal e&s;teem or affection. Indeed, without an unu&s;ual &s;hare of natural &s;en&s;ibility, and very peculiar good fortune, a woman in this country has very little probability of marrying for love.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e ob&s;ervations are hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> America, although perfectly ju&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE></P>
<P>It is a maxim laid down among you, and a very prudent one it is, that love is not to begin on your part; but is entirely to be the con&s;equence of our at|tachment to you. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing a woman to have &s;en&s;e and ta&s;te, &s;he will not find many men to whom &s;he can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed to bear any con&s;iderable &s;hare of e&s;teem. Among the&s;e few, it is very great chance if any of them di&s;tingui&s;hes her particularly. Love, at lea&s;t with us, is exceedingly capricious, and will not always fix, where rea&s;on &s;ays it &s;hould. But &s;uppo&s;ing one of them &s;hould become particularly
<PB N="108" REF="024452_0105_0FC73DBDFB4128B0">
attached to her, it is &s;till extremely improbable that he &s;hould be the man in the world her heart mo&s;t approves of.</P>
<P>As, therefore, nature has not given you that un|limited range in your choice which we enjoy, &s;he has wi&s;ely and benevolently a&s;&s;igned to you a greater flexibility of ta&s;te on this &s;ubject. Some agreeable qualities recommend a gentleman to your common good liking and friend&s;hip. In the cour&s;e of his acquaintance, he contracts an attachment to you. When you perceive it, it excites your gratitude: this gratitude ri&s;es into a preference: and this pre|ference, perhaps, at la&s;t advances to &s;ome degree of attachment, e&s;pecially if it meets with cro&s;&s;es and difficulties; for the&s;e, and a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, are very great incitements to attachment, and are the food of love in both &s;exes. If attachment was not excited in your &s;ex in this manner, there is not one of a million of you, that could ever marry with any degree of love.</P>
<P>A man of ta&s;te and delicacy marries a woman, be|cau&s;e he loves her more that any other. A woman of equal ta&s;te and delicacy marries him becau&s;e &s;he e&s;teems him, and becau&s;e he gives her that prefer|ence. But if a man unfortunately becomes attached to a woman who&s;e heart is &s;ecretly pre-engaged, his attachment, in&s;tead of obtaining a &s;uitable return, is particularly offen&s;ive; and if he per&s;i&s;ts to teaze her, he makes him&s;elf equally the object of her &s;corn and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The effects of love among men are diver&s;ified by their different tempers. An artful man may coun|terfeit every one of them &s;o ea&s;ily, as to impo&s;e on a young girl of an open, generous, and feeling heart, if &s;he be not extremely on her guard. The fine&s;t parts in &s;uch a girl may not always prove &s;ufficient for her &s;ecurity. The dark and crooked paths of cunning are un&s;earchable and inconceivable to an honourable and elevated mind.</P>
<P>The following, I apprehend, are the mo&s;t genuine effects of an honourable pa&s;&s;ion among the men, and
<PB REF="024452_0106_0FC73DC046F839B8">
<PB N="109" REF="024452_0107_0FC73DC1B5B28178">
the mo&s;t difficult to counterfeit. A man of delicacy often betrays his pa&s;&s;ion by his too great anxiety to conceal it, e&s;pecially if he has little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. True love, in all its &s;tages, &s;eeks concealment, and never expects &s;ucce&s;s. It renders a man not only re|&s;pectful, but timid to the highe&s;t degree, in his be|haviour to the woman he loves. To conceal the awe &s;he in&s;pires him with, he may &s;ometimes affect plea&s;antry; but it &s;its aukwardly on him, and he quickly relap&s;es into &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, if not into dullne&s;s. He magnifies all her real perfections in his imagina|tion, and is either blind to her failings, or converts them into beauties. Like a per&s;on con&s;cious of guilt, he is jealous that every eye ob&s;erves his; and to avoid this, he &s;huns all the little ob&s;ervances of common gallantry.</P>
<P>His heart and his character will be improved in every re&s;pect by his attachment. His manners will become more gentle, and his conver&s;ation more agreeable: but diffidence and embarra&s;&s;ment will al|ways make him appear to di&s;advantage in the com|pany of his mi&s;tre&s;s. If the fa&s;cination continue long&punc; it will totally depre&s;s his &s;pirits, and extingui&s;h every active, vigorous, and manly principle of his mind. You will find this &s;ubject beautifully and pa|thetically painted in Thom&s;on's Spring.</P>
<P>When you ob&s;erve, in a gentleman's behaviour, the&s;e marks which I have de&s;cribed above, reflect &s;e|riou&s;ly what you are to do. If his attachment be agreeable to you, I leave you to do as nature, good &s;en&s;e, and delicacy &s;hall direct you. If you love him, let me advi&s;e you never to di&s;cover to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he full extent of your love, no not although you marry him. That &s;ufficiently &s;hows your preference, which is all he is entitled to know. If he has delicacy, he will a&s;k for no &s;tronger proof of affection, for your &s;ake; if he has &s;en&s;e, he will not a&s;k it for his own. This is an unplea&s;ant truth; but it is my duty to let you know it. Violent love cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, at lea&s;t cannot be expre&s;&s;ed, for any time together, on both &s;ides; otherwi&s;e the certain con&s;equence, however

concealed, is &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t. Nature in this ca&s;e has laid the re&s;erve on you.</P>
<P>If you &s;ee evident proofs of a gentleman's attach|ment, and are determined to &s;hut your heart again&s;t him, as you ever hope to be u&s;ed with genero&s;ity by the per&s;on who &s;hall engage your own heart, treat him honourably and humanely. Do not let him lin|ger in a mi&s;erable &s;u&s;pen&s;e; but be anxious to let him know your &s;entiments with regard to him.</P>
<P>However people's hearts may deceive them, there is &s;carcely a per&s;on that can love for any time, with|out at lea&s;t &s;ome di&s;tant hope of &s;ucce&s;s. If you really wi&s;h to undeceive a lover, you may do it in a variety of ways. There is a certain &s;pecies of ea&s;y familiarity in your behaviour, which may &s;atisfy him, if he has any di&s;cernment left, that he has no|thing to hope for. But perhaps your particular tem|per may not admit of this: you may ea&s;ily &s;how that you want to avoid his company; but if he be a man who&s;e friend&s;hip you wi&s;h to pre&s;erve, you may not choo&s;e this method, becau&s;e then you lo&s;e him in every capacity. You may get a common friend to ex|plain matters to him, or fall on many other devices, if you be &s;eriou&s;ly anxious to put him out of &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>But if you be re&s;olved again&s;t every &s;uch method, at lea&s;t do not &s;hun opportunities of letting him ex|plain him&s;elf. If you do this, you act barbarou&s;ly and unju&s;tly. If he brings you to an explanation, give him a polite, but re&s;olute and deci&s;ive an&s;wer. In whatever way you convey your &s;entiments to him, if he is a man of &s;pirit and delicacy, he will give you no further trouble, nor apply to your friends for their interce&s;&s;ion. This la&s;t is a method of court|&s;hip, which every man of &s;pirit will di&s;dain. He will never whine nor &s;ue for your pity: that would mortify him almo&s;t as much as your &s;corn. In &s;hort, you may po&s;&s;ibly break &s;uch a heart, but you can never bend it. Great pride always accompanies de|licacy, however concealed under the appearance of the utmo&s;t gentlene&s;s and mode&s;ty, and is the pa&s;&s;ion of all others the mo&s;t difficult to conquer.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="024452_0109_0FC73DCD84BB2A98">There is a ca&s;e where a woman may coquette ju&s;|tifiably to the utmo&s;t verge which her con&s;cience will allow. It is where a gentleman purpo&s;ely declines to make his addre&s;&s;es, till &s;uch time as he thinks him&s;elf perfectly &s;ure of her con&s;ent. This, at bot|tom, is intended to force a woman to give up the undoubted privilege of her &s;ex, the privilege of re|fu&s;ing; it is intended to force her to explain her&s;elf, in effect, before the gentleman deigns to do it, and by this means to oblige her to violate the mode&s;ty and delicacy of her &s;ex, and to invert the cleare&s;t order of nature. All this &s;acrifice is propo&s;ed to be made merely to gratify a mo&s;t de&s;picable vanity in a man, who would degrade the very woman whom he wi&s;hes to make his wife.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to di&s;tingui&s;h whether a gentleman who has the appearance of being your lover, delays to &s;peak explicitly, from the motive I have mentioned, or from a diffidence in&s;eparable from true attachment. In the one ca&s;e, you can &s;carce|ly u&s;e him too ill; in the other, you ought to u&s;e him with great kindne&s;s: and the greate&s;t kindne&s;s you can &s;how him, if you are determined not to li&s;ten to his addre&s;&s;es, is to let him know it as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>I know the many excu&s;es with which women en|deavour to ju&s;tify them&s;elves to the world, and to their own con&s;ciences, when they act otherwi&s;e. Sometimes they plead ignorance, or at lea&s;t uncer|tainty, of the gentleman's real &s;entiments. That may &s;ometimes be the ca&s;e. Sometimes they plead the decorum of their &s;ex, which enjoins an equal be|haviour to all men, and forbids them to con&s;ider any man as a lover till he has directly told them &s;o. Per|haps few women carry their ideas of female delicacy and decorum &s;o far as I do. But I mu&s;t &s;ay, you are not entitled to plead the obligation of the&s;e virtues, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;uperior ones of gratitude, ju&s;|tice, and humanity. The man is entitled to all the&s;e, who prefers you to the re&s;t of your &s;ex, and perhaps who&s;e greate&s;t weakne&s;s is this very preference.
<PB N="112" REF="024452_0110_0FC73DCF43041070">
The truth of the matter is, vanity, and the love of admiration, is &s;o prevailing a pa&s;&s;ion among you, that you may be con&s;idered to make a very great &s;a|crifice whenever you give up a lover, till every art of coquetry fails to keep him, or till he forces you to an explanation. You can be fond of the love, when you are indifferent to, or even when you de&s;pi&s;e the lover.</P>
<P>But the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t artful coquetry is em|ployed by women of &s;uperior ta&s;te and &s;en&s;e, to en|gage and fix the heart of a man whom the world and whom they them&s;elves e&s;teem, although they are firm|ly determined never to marry him. But his conver|&s;ation amu&s;es them, and his attachment is the high|e&s;t gratification to their vanity: nay, they can &s;ome|times be gratified with the utter ruin of his fortune, fame, and happine&s;s. God forbid I &s;hould ever think &s;o of all your &s;ex! I know many of them have prin|ciples, have genero&s;ity and dignity of &s;oul, that ele|vate them above the worthle&s;s vanity I have been &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>Such a woman, I am per&s;uaded, may always con|vert a lover, if &s;he cannot give him her affections, into a warm and &s;teady friend, provided he is a man of &s;en&s;e, re&s;olution, and candour. If &s;he explain her|&s;elf with a generous openne&s;s and freedom, he mu&s;t feel the &s;troke as a man; but he will likewi&s;e bear it as a man: what he &s;uffers, he will &s;uffer in &s;ilence. Every &s;entiment of e&s;teem will remain: but love, though it requires very little food, and is ea&s;ily &s;ur|feited with too much, yet it requires &s;ome. He will view her in the light of a married woman; and though pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ides, yet a man of a candid and generous heart always retains a tenderne&s;s for a woman he has once loved, and who has u&s;ed him well, beyond what he feels for any other of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>If he has not confided his own &s;ecret to any body, he has an undoubted title to a&s;k you not to divulge it. If a woman choo&s;e to tru&s;t any of her compani|ons with her own unfortunate attachments, &s;he may, as it is her own affair alone: but if &s;he has any gene|ro&s;ity
<PB N="113" REF="024452_0111_0FC73DD0B7A42BD0">
or gratitude, &s;he will not betray a &s;ecret which does not belong to her.</P>
<P>Male coquetry is much more inexcu&s;able than fe|male, as well as more pernicious; but it is rare in this country. Very few men will give them&s;elves the trouble to gain or retain any woman's affections, unle&s;s they have views on them either of an honour|able or di&s;honourable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind. Men employed in the pur&s;uits of bu&s;ine&s;s, ambition, or plea&s;ure, will not give them&s;elves the trouble to engage a woman's affections, merely from the vanity of conque&s;t, and of triumphing over the heart of an innocent and defence|le&s;s girl. Be&s;ides, people never value much what is entirely in their power. A man of parts, &s;entiment, and addre&s;s, if he lay a&s;ide all regard to truth and humanity, may engage the hearts of fifty women at the &s;ame time, and may likewi&s;e conduct his coquetry with &s;o much art, as to put it out of the power of any of them to &s;pecify a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion that could be &s;aid to be directly expre&s;&s;ive of love.</P>
<P>This ambiguity of behaviour, this art of keeping one in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, is the great &s;ecret of coquetry in both &s;exes. It is the more cruel in us, becau&s;e we can carry it to what length we plea&s;e, and continue it as long as we plea&s;e, without your being &s;o much as at liberty to complain or expo&s;tulate; whereas we can break our chain, and force you to explain, when|ever we become impatient of our &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I have in&s;i&s;ted the more particularly on this &s;ubject of court&s;hip, becau&s;e it may mo&s;t readily happen to you at that early period of life, when you can have little experience or knowledge of the world; when your pa&s;&s;ions are warm, and your judgments not ar|rived at &s;uch full maturity as to be able to correct them. I wi&s;h you to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch high principles of honour and genero&s;ity, as will render you incapable of deceiving, and at the &s;ame time to po&s;&s;e&s;s that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ute di&s;cernment which may &s;ecure you again&s;t be|ing deceived.</P>
<P>A woman in this country, may ea&s;ily prevent the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of love; and every motive of pru|dence
<PB N="114" REF="024452_0112_0FC73DD2355DDD80">
and delicacy &s;hould make her guard her heart again&s;t them, till &s;uch time as &s;he has received the mo&s;t convincing proofs of the attachment of a man of &s;uch merit, as will ju&s;tify a reciprocal regard. Your hearts, indeed, may be &s;hut inflexibly and per|manently again&s;t all the merit a man can po&s;&s;e&s;s. That may be your misfortune, but cannot be your fault. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, you would be equally un|ju&s;t to your&s;elf and your lover, if you gave him your hand, when your heart revolted again&s;t him. But mi&s;erable will be your fate, if you allow an attach|ment to &s;teal on you before you are &s;ure of a return; or, what is infinitely wor&s;e, where there are wanting tho&s;e qualities which alone can in&s;ure happine&s;s in a married &s;tate.</P>
<P>I know nothing that renders a woman more de&s;pi|cable, than her thinking it e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s to be married. Be&s;ides the gro&s;s indelicacy of the &s;en|timent, it is a fal&s;e one, as thou&s;ands of women have experienced. But if it were true, the belief that it is &s;o, and the con&s;equent impatience to be married, is the mo&s;t effectual way to prevent it.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not think from this, that I do not wi&s;h you to marry; on the contrary, I am of opinion, that you may attain a &s;uperior degree of happine&s;s in a married &s;tate, to what you can po&s;&s;ibly find in any other. I know the forlorn and unprotected &s;ituation of an old maid, the chagrin and peevi&s;hne&s;s which are apt to infect their tempers, and the great difficul|ty of making a tran&s;ition, with dignity and cheerful|ne&s;s, from the period of youth, beauty, admiration, and re&s;pect, into the calm, &s;ilent, unnoticed retreat of declining years.</P>
<P>I &s;ee &s;ome unmarried women, of active, vigorous minds, and great vivacity of &s;pirits, degrading them|&s;elves; &s;ometimes by entering into a di&s;&s;ipated cour&s;e of life, un&s;uitable to their years, and expo&s;ing them|&s;elves to the ridicule of girls, who might have been their grand-children; &s;ometimes by oppre&s;&s;ing their acquaintances by impertinent intru&s;ions into their private affairs; and &s;ometimes by being the propa|gators
<PB N="115" REF="024452_0113_0FC73DDB20BB6500">
of &s;candal and defamation. All this is owing to an exuberant activity of &s;pirit, which, if it had found employment at home, would have rendered them re&s;pectable and u&s;eful members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I &s;ee other women, in the &s;ame &s;ituation, gentle, mode&s;t, ble&s;&s;ed with &s;en&s;e, ta&s;te, delicacy, and every milder feminine virtue of the heart, but of weak &s;pi|rits, ba&s;hful, and timid; I &s;ee &s;uch women &s;inking into ob&s;curity and in&s;ignificance, and gradually lo&s;|ing every elegant accompli&s;hment; for this evident rea&s;on, that they are not united to a partner who has &s;en&s;e, and worth, and ta&s;te, to know their value; one who is able to draw forth their concealed quali|ties, and &s;how them to advantage; who can give that &s;upport to their feeble &s;pirits, which they &s;tand &s;o much in need of; and who, by his affection and ten|derne&s;s, might make &s;uch a woman happy, in exert|ing every talent, and accompli&s;hing her&s;elf in eve|ry elegant art that could contribute to his amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I am of opinion, that a married &s;tate, if entered into from proper motives of e&s;teem and affec|tion, will be the happie&s;t for your&s;elves, make you mo&s;t re&s;pectable in the eyes of the world, and the mo&s;t u&s;eful members of &s;ociety: but I confe&s;s I am not enough of a patriot, to wi&s;h you to marry for the good of the public;&mdash;I wi&s;h you to marry for no other rea&s;on but to make your&s;elves happier. When I am &s;o particular in my advices about your conduct, I own my heart beats with the fond hopes of mak|ing you worthy the attachment of men who will de|&s;erve you, and be &s;en&s;ible of your merit. But hea|ven forbid you &s;hould ever relinqui&s;h the ea&s;e and independence of a &s;ingle life, to become the &s;laves of a fool or a tyrant's caprice.</P>
<P>As the&s;e have always been my &s;entiments, I &s;hall do you but ju&s;tice, when I leave you in &s;uch inde|pendent circum&s;tances, as may lay you under no temp|tation to do from nece&s;&s;ity what you would never do from choice. This will likewi&s;e &s;ave you from that cruel mortification to a woman of &s;pirit, the &s;u&s;picion
<PB N="116" REF="024452_0114_0FC73DDCCA2C0100">
that a gentleman thinks he does you an honour or a favour, when he a&s;ks you for his wife.</P>
<P>If I live till you arrive at that age when you &s;hall be capable to judge for your&s;elves, and do not &s;trange|ly alter my &s;entiments, I &s;hall act towards you in a very different manner from what mo&s;t parents do. My opinion has always been, that when that period arrives, the parental authority cea&s;es.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall always treat you with that affection and ea&s;y confidence which may di&s;po&s;e you to look on me as your friend; in that capacity alone I &s;hall think my&s;elf entitled to give you my opinion; in the doing of which, I &s;hould think my&s;elf highly crimi|nal, if I did not, to the utmo&s;t of my power, endea|vour to dive&s;t my&s;elf of all per&s;onal vanity, and all prejudices in favour of my particular ta&s;te. If you did not choo&s;e to follow my advice, I &s;hould not, on that account, cea&s;e to love you as my children: though my right to your obedience was expired, yet I &s;hould think nothing could relea&s;e me from the ties of nature and humanity.</P>
<P>You may, perhaps, imagine, that the re&s;erved beha|viour which I recommend to you, and your appear|ing &s;eldom at public places, mu&s;t cut off all opportu|nities of your being acquainted with gentlemen; I am very far from intending this. I advi&s;e you to no re&s;erve, but what will render you more re&s;pected and beloved by our &s;ex. I do not think public places &s;uited to make people acquainted together: they can only be di&s;tingui&s;hed there by their looks and exter|nal behaviour; but it is in private companies alone, where you can expect ea&s;y and agreeable conver&s;ation, which I &s;hould never wi&s;h you to decline. If you do not allow gentlemen to become acquainted with you, you can never expect to marry with attachment on either &s;ide. Love is very &s;eldom produced at fir&s;t &s;ight, at lea&s;t it mu&s;t have, in that ca&s;e, a very un|ju&s;tifiable foundation. True love is founded on e&s;|teem, in a corre&s;pondence of ta&s;tes and &s;entiments, and &s;teals on the heart imperceptibly.</P>
<P>There is one advice I &s;hall leave you, to which I
<PB N="117" REF="024452_0115_0FC73DDE447B7600">
beg your particular attention:&mdash;Before your affections come to be in the lea&s;t engaged to any man, examine your tempers, your ta&s;tes, and your hearts, very &s;everely, and &s;ettle in your own minds, what are the requi&s;ites to your happine&s;s in a married &s;tate; and, as it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould get every thing you wi&s;h, come to a &s;teady determination what you are to con&s;ider as e&s;&s;ential, and what may be &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>If you have hearts di&s;po&s;ed by nature for love and friend&s;hip, and po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e feelings which enable you to enter into all the refinements and delicacies of the&s;e attachments, con&s;ider well, for heaven's &s;ake, and as you value your future happine&s;s, before you give them any indulgence. If you have the misfor|tune (for a very great misfortune it commonly is to your &s;ex) to have &s;uch a temper and &s;uch &s;entiments deeply rooted in you, if you have &s;pirit and re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t the &s;olicitations of vanity, the per&s;ecution of friends (for you will have lo&s;t the only friend that would never per&s;ecute you,) and can &s;upport the pro&s;|pect of the many inconveniences attending the &s;tate of an old maid, which I formerly pointed out, then you may indulge your&s;elves in that kind of &s;entimen|tal reading and conver&s;ation which is mo&s;t corre&s;pon|dent to your feelings.</P>
<P>But if you find, on a &s;trict &s;elf-examination, that marriage is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to your happine&s;s, keep the &s;ecret inviolable in your own bo&s;oms, for the rea|&s;ons I formerly mentioned: but &s;hun, as you would do the mo&s;t fatal poi&s;on, all that &s;pecies of read|ing and conver&s;ation which warms the imagination, which engages and &s;oftens the heart, and rai&s;es the ta&s;te above the level of common life: if you do other|wi&s;e, con&s;ider the terrible conflict of pa&s;&s;ions this may afterwards rai&s;e in your brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>If this refinement once takes deep root in your minds, and you do not obey its dictates, but marry from vulgar and mercenary views, you may never be able to eradicate it entirely, and then it will embit|ter all your married days. In&s;tead of meeting with
<PB N="118" REF="024452_0116_0FC73DE007309F38">
&s;en&s;e, delicacy, tenderne&s;s, a lover, a friend, an equal companion, in a hu&s;band, you may be tired with in|&s;ipidity and dulne&s;s; &s;hocked with indelicacy, or mor|tified by indifference. You will find none to com|pa&s;&s;ionate, or even under&s;tand your &s;ufferings; for your hu&s;bands may not u&s;e you cruelly, and may give you as much money for your clothes, per&s;onal ex|pen&s;e, and dome&s;tic nece&s;&s;aries, as is &s;uitable to their fortunes. The world would therefore look on you as unrea&s;onable women, and that did not de&s;erve to be happy, if you were not &s;o. To avoid the&s;e complicat|ed evils, if you are determined at all events to marry, I would advi&s;e you to make all your reading and amu&s;ements of &s;uch a kind, as do not affect the heart nor the imagination, except in the way of wit or humour.</P>
<P>I have no view by the&s;e advices to lead your ta&s;tes; I only want to per&s;uade you of the nece&s;&s;ity of know|ing your own minds, which, though &s;eemingly very ea&s;y, is what your &s;ex &s;eldom attain on many impor|tant occa&s;ions in life, but particularly on this of which I am &s;peaking. There is not a quality I more anxi|ou&s;ly wi&s;h you to po&s;&s;e&s;s, than that collected, deci&s;ive &s;pirit, which re&s;ts on it&s;elf, which enables you to &s;ee where your true happine&s;s lies, and to pur&s;ue it with the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution. In matters of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, follow the advice of tho&s;e who know them bet|ter than your&s;elves, and in who&s;e integrity you can confide: but in matters of ta&s;te, that depend on your own feeling, con&s;ult no one friend whatever, but con&s;ult your own hearts.</P>
<P>If a gentleman makes his addre&s;&s;es to you, or gives you rea&s;on to believe he will do &s;o, before you allow your affections to be engaged, endeavo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, in the mo&s;t prudent and &s;ecret manner, to procure from your friends every nece&s;&s;ary piece of information concern|ing him; &s;uch as his character for &s;en&s;e, his morals, his temper, fortune&punc; and family; whether it is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for parts and worth, or for folly, knave|ry, and loath&s;ome hereditary di&s;ea&s;es. When your friends inform you of the&s;e, they have fulfilled their
<PB N="119" REF="024452_0117_0FC73DE7DDC8B5C8">
duty. If they go farther, they have not that defe|rence for you, which a becoming dignity on your part would effectually command.</P>
<P>Whatever your views are in marrying, take every po&s;&s;ible precaution to prevent their being di&s;appoint|ed. If fortune and the plea&s;ures it brings, are your aim, it is not &s;ufficient that the &s;ettlements of a join|ture and children's provi&s;ions be ample, and proper|ly &s;ecured; it is nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould enjoy the fortune during your own life. The principal &s;ecuri|ty you can have for this, will depend on your marry|ing a good-natured, generous man, who de&s;pi&s;es mo|ney, and who will let you live where you can be&s;t en|joy that plea&s;ure, that pomp and parade of life, for which you married him.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;aid, you will ea&s;ily &s;ee that I could never pretend to advi&s;e whom you &s;hould mar|ry; but I can with great confidence advi&s;e whom you &s;hould not marry.</P>
<P>Avoid a companion that may entail any hereditary di&s;ea&s;e on your po&s;terity, particularly (that mo&s;t dreadful of all human calamities) madne&s;s. It is the height of imprudence to run into &s;uch a danger, and, in my opinion, highly criminal.</P>
<P>Do not marry a fool; he is the mo&s;t intractable of all animals; he is led by his pa&s;&s;ions and caprices, and is incapable of hearing the voice of rea&s;on. It may probably, too, hurt your vanity to have hu&s;bands for whom you have rea&s;on to blu&s;h and tremble every time they open their lips in company. But the wor&s;t circum&s;tance that attends a fool, is his con&s;tant jeal|ou&s;y of his wife being thought to govern him. This renders it impo&s;&s;ible to lead him; and he is continu|ally doing ab&s;urd and di&s;agreeable things, for no other rea&s;on but to &s;how he dares do them.</P>
<P>A rake is always a &s;u&s;picious hu&s;band, becau&s;e he has only known the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of your &s;ex. He likewi&s;e entails the wor&s;t di&s;ea&s;es on his wife and children, if he has the misfortune to have any.</P>
<P>If you have a &s;en&s;e of religion your&s;elves, do not think of hu&s;bands who have none. If they have toler|able
<PB N="120" REF="024452_0118_0FC73DEB251BADF8">
under&s;tandings, they will be glad that you have religion, for their own &s;akes, and for the &s;ake of their families; but it will &s;ink you in their e&s;teem. If they are weak men, they will be continually teaz|ing and &s;hocking you about your principles.&mdash;If you have children, you will &s;uffer the mo&s;t bitter di&s;tre&s;s, in &s;eeing all your endeavours to form their minds to virtue and piety, all your endeavours to &s;ecure their pre&s;ent and eternal happine&s;s, fru&s;trated and turned into ridicule.</P>
<P>As I look on your choice of a hu&s;band to be of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to your happine&s;s, I hope you will make it with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection. Do not give way to a &s;udden &s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion, and dignify it with the name of love.&mdash;Genuine love is not founded in caprice; it is founded in nature, on honourable views, on virtue, on &s;imilarity of ta&s;tes and &s;ympathy of &s;ouls.</P>
<P>If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou have the&s;e &s;entiments, you will never marry any one, when you are not in that &s;ituation, in point of fortune, which is nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of either of you. What that competency may be, can only be determined by your own ta&s;tes. It would be ungenerous in you to take advantage of a lover's attachment, to plunge him into di&s;tre&s;s; and if he has any honour, no per&s;onal gratification will ever tempt him to enter into any connexion which will render you unhappy. If you have as much between you, as to &s;atisfy all your demands, it is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with endeavouring to remove a difficulty which mu&s;t naturally occur to any woman of reflexion on the &s;ubject of marriage. What is to become of all tho&s;e refinements of delicacy, that dig|nity of manners, which checked all familiarities, and &s;u&s;pended de&s;ire in re&s;pectful and awful admira|tion? In an&s;wer to this, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if motives of intere&s;t or vanity have had any &s;hare in your re&s;olutions to marry, none of the&s;e chimerical notions will give you any pain: nay, they will very quickly appear as ridiculous in your own eyes, as they probably always did in the eyes of your hu&s;|bands.
<PB N="121" REF="024452_0119_0FC73DEC767ED9F8">
They have been &s;entiments which have float|ed in your imagination, but have never reached your hearts. But if the&s;e &s;entiments have been truly ge|nuine, and if you have had the &s;ingular happy fate to attach tho&s;e who under&s;tand them, you have no rea&s;on to be afraid.</P>
<P>Marriage, indeed, will at once di&s;pel the enchant|ment rai&s;ed by external beauty; but the virtues and graces that fir&s;t warmed the heart, that re&s;erve and delicacy which always left the lover &s;omething fur|ther to wi&s;h, and often made him doubtful of your &s;en&s;ibility or attachment, may and ought ever to re|main. The tumult of pa&s;&s;ion will nece&s;&s;arily &s;ub&s;ide: but it will be &s;ucceeded by endearment, that affects the heart in a more equal, more &s;en&s;ible, and tender manner. But I mu&s;t check my&s;elf, and not indulge in de&s;criptions, that may mi&s;lead you, and that too &s;en&s;ibly awake the remembrance of my happier days, which, perhaps, it were better for me to forget for ever.</P>
<P>I have thus given you my opinion on &s;ome of the mo&s;t important articles of your future life, chiefly calculated for that period when you are ju&s;t entering the world. I have endeavoured to avoid &s;ome pecu|liarities of opinion, which, from their contradiction to the general practice of the world, I might rea&s;on|ably have &s;u&s;pected were not &s;o well founded. But, in writing to you, I am afraid my heart has been too full, and too warmly intere&s;ted, to allow me to keep this re&s;olution. This may have produced &s;ome em|barra&s;&s;ments and &s;ome &s;eeming contradictions. What I have written has been the amu&s;ement of &s;ome &s;o|litary hours, and has &s;erved to divert &s;ome melan|choly reflexions.&mdash;I am con&s;cious I undertook a ta&s;k to which I was very unequal; but I have di&s;charged a part of my duty.&mdash;You will, at lea&s;t, be plea&s;ed with it, as the la&s;t mark of your father's love and attention.</P>

<HEAD>THE LADIES' LIBRARY. An unfortunate Mother's Advice to her ab&s;ent Daugh|ters, in a Letter to Mi&s;s Pennington.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the late Lady Pennington.</BYLINE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Jenny,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WAS there any probability that a letter from me would be permitted to reach <HI>your hand alone,</HI> I &s;hould not have cho&s;en this lea&s;t eligible method of writing to you. The public is no way concerned in family affairs, and ought not to be made a party in them; but my circum&s;tances are &s;uch, as lay me under the nece&s;&s;ity of either communicating my &s;entiments to the world, or of concealing them <HI>from you:</HI> the latter would, I think, be the breach of an indi&s;pen&s;a|ble duty, which obliges me to waive the impropriety of the former.</P>
<P>A long train of events, of a mo&s;t extraordinary na|ture, con&s;pired to remove you very early from the tender care of an affectionate mother. You were too young to be able to form any right judgment of her conduct; and &s;ince that time it is very probable that it has been repre&s;ented to you in a mo&s;t unfavourable light. The general prejudice again&s;t me I never gave my&s;elf the u&s;ele&s;s trouble of any endeavour to remove. I do not mean to infer from hence, that the opinion of
<PB N="124" REF="024452_0121_0FC73DEF753F4578">
others is of no material con&s;equence; on the contrary, I would advi&s;e you always to remember, that, next to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of acting right, the public voice &s;hould be regarded; and to endeavour by a prudent behaviour, even in the mo&s;t trifling in&s;tances, to &s;ecure it in your favour. The being educated in a different opinion, was a misfortune to <HI>me.</HI> I was indeed early and wi&s;ely taught, that virtue was the one thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and that without it no happine&s;s could be ex|pected either in this, or in any future &s;tat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of exi&s;tence; but, with this good principle, a mi&s;taken one was at the &s;ame time inculcated, namely, that the &s;elf-ap|probation ari&s;ing from con&s;cious virtue was alone &s;ufficient; and, that the cen&s;ures of an ill-natured world, ever ready to calumniate, when not founded on truth, were beneath the concern of a per&s;on who&s;e actions were guided by the &s;uperior motive of obedi|ence to the will of heaven.</P>
<P>This notion, &s;trongly imbibed before rea&s;on had gained &s;ufficient &s;trength to di&s;cover its fallacy, was the cau&s;e of an incon&s;iderate conduct in my &s;ub&s;equent life, which marked my character with a di&s;advanta|geous impre&s;&s;ion. To you I &s;hall &s;peak with the mo&s;t unre&s;erved &s;incerity, not concealing a fault which you may profit by the knowledge of; and therefore I freely own, that in my younger years, &s;atisfied with keeping &s;trictly within the bounds of virtue, I took a fooli&s;h plea&s;ure in exceeding tho&s;e of prudence, and was ridiculou&s;ly vain of indulging a latitude of beha|viour, into which others of my age were afraid of launching: but then, in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time declare, that this freedom was only taken in public company; and &s;o extremely cautious was I of doing any thing which appeared to me a ju&s;t ground for cen&s;ure, that I call heaven to witne&s;s, your father was the fir&s;t man whom I ever made any private a&s;&s;ignation with, or even met in a room a|lone; nor did I tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that liberty with him till the mo&s;t &s;olemn mutual engagement, the matrimonial ce|remony, had bound us to each other. My behaviour, then, he has frequently &s;ince acknowledged, fully
<PB N="125" REF="024452_0122_0FC73DF81AD67008">
convinced him I was not only innocent of any crimi|nal act, but of every vicious thought; and that the outward freedom of my deportment, which proceed|ed merely from a great gaiety of temper, and from a very high flow of &s;pirits, never broke (if the ex|pre&s;&s;ion may be allowed) into the formal rules of de|corum. To &s;um up the whole in a few words, my private conduct was what the &s;evere&s;t prude could not condemn; my public, &s;uch as the mo&s;t fini&s;hed coquet alone would have ventured upon: the latter only could be known to the world, and con&s;equent|ly, from thence mu&s;t their opinion be taken. You will therefore ea&s;ily be &s;en&s;ible, that it would not be favourable to me; on the contrary, it gave a ge|neral prejudice again&s;t me: and this has been &s;ince made u&s;e of as an argument to gain credit to the malicious fal&s;ehoods laid to my charge. For this rea|&s;on, convinced by long experience that the greater part of mankind are &s;o apt to receive, and &s;o wil|ling to retain a bad impre&s;&s;ion of others, that, when it is once e&s;tabli&s;hed, there is hardly a po&s;&s;ibility of removing it through life; I have, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, &s;ilently acquie&s;ced in the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, without attempting any ju&s;tification of my&s;elf; and, being con&s;cious that the infamous a&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t on my character were not founded on truth, I have &s;at down content with the certainty of an open and perfect acquittal of all vicious di&s;po&s;itions, or crimi|nal conduct, at that great day, when all things &s;hall appear as they really are, and when both our actions, and the mo&s;t &s;ecret motives for them, will be made manife&s;t to men and angels.</P>
<P>Had your father been among the number of tho&s;e who were deceived by appearances, I &s;hould have thought it my duty to leave no method une&s;&s;ayed to clear my&s;elf in his opinion; but that was not the ca&s;e. He knows that many of tho&s;e appearances which have been urged again&s;t me, I was forced to &s;ubmit to, not only from his direction, but by his ab&s;olute command; which, contrary to rea&s;on and to my own intere&s;t, I was, for more than tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lve years, weak enough im|plicitly
<PB N="126" REF="024452_0123_0FC73DF95BB3A8D8">
to obey; and that others, even &s;ince our &s;epa|ration, were occa&s;ioned by &s;ome particular in&s;tances of his behaviour, which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for me to act with &s;afety in any other manner. To <HI>him</HI> I ap|peal for the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, who is con&s;cious of the meaning that may hereafter be explained to you. Perfectly acquainted with my principles and with my natural di&s;po&s;ition, his heart, I am convinced, never here condemned me. Being greatly incen&s;ed that my father's will gave to me an independent fortune; which will, he imagined, I was acce&s;&s;ary to, or at lea&s;t that I could have prevented; he was thereby laid open to the arts of de&s;igning men, who, having their own intere&s;t &s;olely in view, worked him up into a de&s;ire of revenge, and from thence, upon probable circum&s;tan|ces, into a public accu&s;ation: though that public accu|&s;ation was &s;upported only by the &s;ingle te&s;timony of a per&s;on, who&s;e known fal&s;ehood had made him a thou|&s;and times declare that he would not credit her oath in the mo&s;t trifling incident; yet, when he was di&s;ap|pointed of the additional evidence he might have been flattered with the hope of obtaining, it was too late to recede. This I &s;incerely believe to be the truth of the ca&s;e, though I too well know his <HI>tenacious</HI> temper, to expect a pre&s;ent ju&s;tification; but, whenever he &s;hall arrive on the verge of eternity, if Rea&s;on holds her place at the awful moment, and if religion has then any power on his heart, I make no doubt, he will at that time acquit me to his children; and with truth he mu&s;t then confe&s;s, that no part of my behaviour to him ever de|&s;erved the treatment I have met with.</P>
<P>Sorry am I to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of pointing out faults in the conduct of another, which are, perhaps, long &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce repented of, and ought in that ca&s;e to be as much forgotten as they are mo&s;t truly forgiven. Hea|ven knows, that, &s;o far from retaining any degree of re&s;entment in my heart, the per&s;on breathes not, whom I wi&s;h to hurt, or to whom I would not this moment render every &s;ervice in my power. The injuries which I have &s;u&s;tained, had I no children, &s;hould contentedly be buried in &s;ilence till the great day of retribution;
<PB N="127" REF="024452_0124_0FC73DFAB7360C68">
but, in ju&s;tice to you, to them, and my&s;elf, it is in|cumbent on me, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to efface the fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, which by &s;uch &s;ilence, might be fixed on your mind, and on tho&s;e of your brothers and &s;i&s;ters, whom I include with you. To this end, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enter into a circum&s;tantial hi&s;tory of near fifteen years, full of incidents of a nature &s;o uncom|mon as &s;carcely to be credible. This, I am convinced, will effectually clear me, in your opinion, of the imputations I now lie under; and it will prove, al|mo&s;t to a demon&s;tration, the true cau&s;e of tho&s;e pro|ceedings again&s;t me that were couched under pre|tended motives, as injurious to my reputation as they were fal&s;e in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But this mu&s;t be deferred &s;ome time longer. You are all yet too young to enter into things of this kind, or to judge properly of them. When a few years &s;hall, by ripening your under&s;tandings, remove this objection, you &s;hall be informed of the whole truth, mo&s;t impartially and without di&s;gui&s;e. 'Till then &s;u&s;pend your belief of all that may have reached your ears with regard to me, and wait the knowledge of tho&s;e facts, which my future letters will reveal for your information.</P>
<P>Thus much I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e con|cerning my&s;elf, though foreign to the de&s;ign of <HI>this epi&s;tle,</HI> which is only to remind you that you have &s;till an affectionate mother, who is anxious for your welfare, and de&s;irous of giving you &s;ome advice with regard to your conduct in life. I would lay down a few precepts for you, which, if attended to, will &s;upply as far as it is in my power to &s;upply, the de|privation of a con&s;tant and tender maternal care. The addre&s;s is <HI>to you</HI> in particular, your &s;i&s;ters being yet too young to receive it; but my intention is for the equal &s;ervice of you all.</P>
<P>You are ju&s;t entering, my dear girl, into a world full of deceit and fal&s;ehood, where few per&s;ons or things appear in their true character. Vice hides her deformity with the borrowed garb of virtue; and, though di&s;cernible to an intelligent and careful ob|&s;erver,
<PB N="128" REF="024452_0125_0FC73DFC58A0FE20">
by the unbecoming awkwardne&s;s of her de|portment under it, &s;he pa&s;&s;es on thou&s;ands undetected. Every pre&s;ent plea&s;ure u&s;urps the name of happine&s;s, and as &s;uch deceives the unwary pur&s;uer. Thus one general ma&s;k di&s;gui&s;es the whole face of things; and it requires a long experience, and a penetrating judgment, to di&s;cover the truth. Thrice happy they, who&s;e docile tempers improve from the in&s;tructions of maturer age, and who thereby attain &s;ome degree of this nece&s;&s;ary knowledge, while it may be u&s;eful in directing their conduct!</P>
<P>The turn which your mind may now take, will fix the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of your future life; and I am too nearly concerned for your welfare, not to be mo&s;t &s;olicitou&s;ly anxious that you may be early led into &s;o ju&s;t a way of thinking, as will be productive to you of a prudent, rational behaviour, and which will &s;ecure to you a la&s;ting felicity. You were old enough before our &s;eparation, to convince me that heaven has not denied you a good natural under|&s;tanding. This, if properly cultivated, will &s;et you above that trifling di&s;po&s;ition, too common among the female world, which makes youth ridiculous, maturity in&s;ignificant, and old age contemptible. It is therefore needle&s;s to enlarge on that head, &s;ince good &s;en&s;e is there the be&s;t advi&s;er; and, without it, all admonitions or directions on the &s;ubject would be as fruitle&s;s as to lay down rules for the conduct or for the actions of an ideot.</P>
<P>There is no room to doubt but that &s;ufficient care will be taken to give you a polite education; but a religious one is &s;till of greater con&s;equence. Nece&s;|&s;ary as the former is for your making a proper figure in the world, and for your being well accepted in it, the latter is yet more &s;o, to &s;ecure to you the appro|bation of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Beings; on who&s;e favour depends your everla&s;ting happine&s;s. Let there|fore your duty to GOD be ever the fir&s;t and principal object of your care. As your Creator and Governor, he claims adoration and obedience; as your Father and Friend, he demands &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive duty and affection.

Remember that from this common parent of the uni|ver&s;e you received your life; that to his general pro|vidence you owe the continuance of it; and to his bounty you are indebted for all the health, ea&s;e, ad|vantages, or enjoyments, which help to make that life agreeable. A &s;en&s;e of benefits received natural|ly in&s;pires a grateful di&s;po&s;ition, with a de&s;ire of making &s;uitable returns. All that can here be made, for innumerable favours every moment be&s;towed, is a thankful acknowledgment, and a willing obedience. In the&s;e be never wanting. Make it an invariable rule to begin and end the day with a &s;olemn addre&s;s to the Deity. I mean not by this, what is commonly, with too much propriety, called <HI>&s;aying of prayers,</HI> namely, a cu&s;tomary repetition of a few good words, without either devotion or attention; than which nothing is more inexcu&s;able and affrontive to the Deity; it is the homage of the heart that can alone be accepted by him. Expre&s;&s;ions of our ab&s;olute de|pendence on, and of our entire re&s;ignation to him&mdash; thank&s;givings for the mercies already received&mdash;peti|tions for tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings it is fit for us to pray for&mdash;and interce&s;&s;ions for all our fellow creatures, compo&s;e the principal parts of this duty; which may be compriz|ed in a very few words, or may be more enlarged upon, as the circum&s;tances of time and di&s;po&s;ition may render mo&s;t &s;uitable; for it is not the length, but the &s;incerity and attention of our prayers that will make them efficacious. A good heart, joined to a tolerable under&s;tanding, will &s;eldom be at a lo&s;s for proper words with which to clothe the&s;e &s;enti|ments: and all per&s;ons being be&s;t acquainted with their own particular circum&s;tances, may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t qualified for adapting their petitions and acknowledgments to them; but for tho&s;e who are of a different opinion, there are many excellent forms of prayer already compo&s;ed. Among the&s;e, none that I know of, are equal to doctor Hoadley's, the late bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, which I recommend to your peru&s;al and u&s;e. In the preface to them, you
<PB N="130" REF="024452_0127_0FC73E078E515C08">
will find better in&s;tructions on this head, than I am capable of giving; and to the&s;e I refer you.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged that our petitions cannot in any degree alter the intention of a being, who is in him&s;elf invariable, and without a po&s;&s;ibility of change: all that can be expected from them is, that, by bettering our&s;elves, they will render us more proper objects of his favourable regard: and this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the re&s;ult of a &s;erious, regular, and con&s;tant di&s;charge of this branch of our duty; for it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to offer up our &s;incere and fervent devotions to heaven every morning and eve|ning, without leaving on our minds &s;uch u&s;eful im|pre&s;&s;ions as will naturally di&s;po&s;e us to a ready and cheerful obedience, and will in&s;pire a filial fear of offending, the be&s;t &s;ecurity virtue can have. As you value your own happine&s;s, let not the force of bad examples ever lead you into an habitual di&s;u&s;e of &s;e|cret prayer; nor let an unpardonable negligence &s;o far prevail on you, as to make you re&s;t &s;atisfied with a formal, cu&s;tomary, inattentive repetition of &s;ome w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l-cho&s;en words: let your heart and attention al|ways go with your lips; and experience will &s;oon convince you, that this permi&s;&s;ion of addre&s;&s;ing the &s;upreme being is the mo&s;t valuable prerogative of human nature; the chief, nay the only &s;upport under all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calamities to which this &s;tate of &s;in and mi&s;ery is liable; the highe&s;t rational &s;atis|faction the mind is capable of on this &s;ide the grave; and the be&s;t preparative for everla&s;ting happine&s;s be|yond it. This is a duty ever in your own power; and therefore you only will be culpable by the omi&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Public wor&s;hip may not always be &s;o: but when|ever it is, do not wilfully neglect the &s;ervice of the church, at lea&s;t on Sundays; and let your behaviour there be adapted to the &s;olemnity of the place, and to the intention of the meeting. Regard neither the actions nor the dre&s;s of others: let not your eyes rove in &s;earch of acquaintance; but in the time of divine &s;ervice avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all com|plimental
<PB N="131" REF="024452_0128_0FC73E08F6D9EA78">
civilities, of which there is too great an intercour&s;e, in mo&s;t of our churches. Remember that your only bu&s;ine&s;s there is to pay a &s;olemn act of devotion to Almighty God, and let every part of your conduct be &s;uitable to this great end. If you hear a good &s;ermon, trea&s;ure it in your memory, that you may reap all the benefit it was capable of im|parting; if you &s;hould hear but an indifferent one, &s;ome good things mu&s;t be in it; retain tho&s;e, and let the remainder be buried in oblivion. Ridicule not the preacher, who, no doubt, has done his be&s;t, and who is rather the object of pity than of contempt, for having been placed in a &s;ituation of life, to which his talents were not equal: he may perhaps be a good man, though he is not a great orator.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o recommend to you the early and fre|quent participation of the communion, or what is commonly called receiving the &s;acrament, as the in|di&s;pen&s;ible duty of every chri&s;tian. There is no in|&s;titution of our religion more &s;imple, plain, and in|telligible than this, as delivered to us by our Savi|our: and mo&s;t of the elaborate treati&s;es written on the &s;ubject have &s;erved only to puzzle and to di&s;turb weak minds, by throwing the dark veil of &s;uper&s;ti|tion and of human invention over a plain, po&s;itive command, given by him in &s;o explicit a manner as to be ea&s;ily comprehended by the meane&s;t capacity, and which is doubtle&s;s in the power of all his &s;incere followers to pay an acceptable obedience to. Nothing has more contributed to the neglect of this duty, than the numerous well-meaning books that have been written to enjoin a month's or a week's pre|paration, as previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to the due perform|ance of it: by the&s;e means filling the minds of many with needle&s;s terror, putting it even out of the pow|er of &s;ome to receive it at all, and inducing great numbers to re&s;t &s;atisfied with doing it only once or twice a year, on &s;ome high fe&s;tival; whereas it was certainly the con&s;tant cu&s;tom of the apo&s;ties and pri|mitive chri&s;tians on every Sunday; and it ought to be received by us as often as it is admini&s;tered in the
<PB N="132" REF="024452_0129_0FC73E0B9E4E6858">
church we frequent, which in mo&s;t places is but once in a month. Nor do I think it excu&s;able, at any time, to turn our backs upon the table we &s;ee prepared for that purpo&s;e, on pretence of not being fit to partake worthily of it. The be&s;t, the only true preparation for this, and for every other part of religious duty, is a good and virtuous life, by which the mind is con&s;tantly kept in &s;uch a devotional frame, as to re|quire but a little recollection to be &s;uited to any par|ticular act of wor&s;hip or of obedience that may oc|ca&s;ionally offer: and without a good and virtuous life, there cannot be a greater or more fatal mi&s;take than to &s;uppo&s;e that a few days or weeks &s;pent in hu|miliation and prayer will render us at all the more acceptable to the Deity, or that we &s;hould be thereby better fitted for any one in&s;tance of that duty which we mu&s;t univer&s;ally pay, to be either approved by him, or to be advantageous to our&s;elves: I would not therefore advi&s;e you to read any of tho&s;e weekly preparatives, which are too apt to lead the mind into error, by teaching it to re&s;t in a mere &s;hadow of piety, wherein there is nothing rationally &s;ati&s;|factory. The be&s;t books which I have ever met with on this &s;ubject, are bi&s;hop Hoadly's <HI>Plain account of the nature and end of the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;up|per,</HI> and Nel&s;on's <HI>Great duty of frequenting the chri&s;tian &s;acrifice.</HI> To the former are annexed the prayers which I before mentioned: the&s;e are well worth your attentive peru&s;al: the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution is therein fully explained, agreeable both to &s;cripture and to rea&s;on; &s;tript of that veil of my&s;tery which has been indu&s;triou&s;ly thrown over it by de&s;igning or by mi&s;taken men; and it is there laid as plainly open to every capacity, as it was at fir&s;t left us by our great ma&s;ter. Read <HI>the&s;e books</HI> with due attention: you will there find every nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truction con|cerning the right, and every rea&s;onable inducement to the con&s;tant and to the con&s;cientious performance of it.</P>
<P>The &s;incere practice of religious duties naturally leads to the proper di&s;charge of the &s;ocial, which
<PB N="133" REF="024452_0130_0FC73E0CBAA99BD0">
may be all comprehended in that one great general rule of <HI>doing unto others as you would they &s;hould do unto you;</HI> but of the&s;e more particularly hereafter. &mdash;I &s;hall fir&s;t give you my advice concerning <HI>employ|ment,</HI> it being of great moment to &s;et out in life in &s;uch a method as may be u&s;eful to your&s;elf and bene|ficial to others.</P>
<P>Time is invaluable; its lo&s;s is irretrievable! The remembrance of having made an ill u&s;e of it mu&s;t be one of the &s;harpe&s;t tortures to tho&s;e who are on the brink of eternity! and what can yield a more un|plea&s;ing retro&s;pect, than whole years idled away in an irrational, in&s;ignificant manner, examples of which are continually before our eyes! Look on every day as a blank &s;heet of paper put into your hands to be filled up: remember the characters will remain to endle&s;s ages, and that they never can be expunged; be careful therefore not to write any thing but what you may read with plea&s;ure a thou&s;and years after. I would not be under&s;tood in a &s;en&s;e &s;o &s;trict as might debar you from any innocent amu&s;ement, &s;uitable to your age, and agreeable to your inclination. Di|ver&s;ions, properly regulated, are not only allowa|ble, they are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to youth, and are never criminal, but when taken to exce&s;s; that is, when they engro&s;s the whole thought, when they are made the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of life: they then give a di&s;|ta&s;te to every valuable employment, and by a &s;ort of infatuation, leave the mind in a &s;tate of re&s;tle&s;s im|patience from the conclu&s;ion of one 'till the com|mencement of another. This is the unfortunate di&s;|po&s;ition of many. Guard mo&s;t carefully again&s;t it, for nothing can be attended with more pernicious con&s;equences. A little ob&s;ervation will convince you that there is not, among the human &s;pecies, a &s;et of more mi&s;erable beings, than tho&s;e who cannot live out of a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of diver&s;ions. The&s;e people have no comprehen&s;ion of the more &s;atisfac|tory plea&s;ure to be found in retirement: thought is in&s;upportable, and con&s;equently &s;olitude mu&s;t be in|tolerable to them; they are a burden to them&s;elves,

and a pe&s;t to their acquaintance, by vainly &s;eeking for happine&s;s in company, where they are &s;eldom ac|ceptable: I &s;ay vainly, for true happine&s;s exi&s;ts only in the mind; nothing foreign can give it. The ut|mo&s;t to be attained by what is called a gay life, is a &s;hort forgetfulne&s;s of mi&s;ery, to be felt with accu|mulated angui&s;h in every interval of reflexion. This re&s;tle&s;s temper is frequently the product of a too eager pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure in the early part of life, to the neglect of tho&s;e valuable improvements which would lay the foundation of a more &s;olid and per|manent felicity. Youth is the &s;ea&s;on for diver&s;ions; but it is al&s;o the &s;ea&s;on for acquiring knowledge, for fixing u&s;eful habits, and for laying in a &s;tock of &s;uch well-cho&s;en materials, as may grow into a &s;erene happine&s;s, which will increa&s;e with every added year of life, and will bloom in the fulle&s;t per|fection in the decline of it. The great art of edu|cation con&s;i&s;ts in a&s;&s;igning to each its proper place, in &s;uch a manner that the one &s;hall never become irk&s;ome by intrenching on the other.&mdash;Our &s;epara|tion having taken from me the plea&s;ing ta&s;k of en|deavouring, to the be&s;t of my ability, to &s;uit them occa&s;ionally, as might be mo&s;t conducive both to your profit and plea&s;ure, it only remains for me to give you general rules, which, indeed, accidents may make it nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes to vary; tho&s;e however mu&s;t be left to your own di&s;cretion; and I am convinc|ed you have a &s;ufficient &s;hare of under&s;tanding to be very capable of making advantageou&s;ly &s;uch ca|&s;ual regulations for your&s;elf, if the inclination is not wanting.</P>
<P>It is an excellent method to appropriate the morn|ing wholly to improvement; the afternoon may then be allowed to diver&s;ions. Under this la&s;t head, I place company, books of the amu&s;ing kind, and en|tertaining productions of the needle, as well as plays, balls, cards, &amp;c. which more commonly go by the name of diver&s;ions: the afternoon, and evening till &s;upper, may by the&s;e be employed with innocence and propriety; but let not one of them ever be &s;uf|fered

to intrude on the former part of the day, which &s;hould be always devoted to more u&s;eful employ|ments. One half hour, or more, either before or immediately after breakfa&s;t, I would have you con|&s;tantly give to the attentive peru&s;al of &s;ome rational|ly pious author, or to &s;ome part of the New Te&s;ta|ment, with which, and indeed with the whole &s;crip|ture, you ought to make your&s;elf perfectly acquaint|ed, as the ba&s;is on which your religion is founded. From this practice you will reap more real benefit, than can be &s;uppo&s;ed by tho&s;e who have never made the experiment. The other hours may be divided among tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary and polite acqui&s;itions which are &s;uitable to your &s;ex, age, and to your rank in life.&mdash;Study <HI>your own language</HI> thoroughly, that you may &s;peak correctly, and write grammatically: do not content your&s;elf with the common u&s;e of words, which cu&s;tom has taught you from the cradle, but learn from whence they are derived, and what are their proper &s;ignifications.&mdash;<HI>French</HI> you ought to be as well acquainted with as with <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> might, without much difficulty, be added.&mdash;Acquire a good knowledge of hi&s;tory; that of your own coun|try fir&s;t, then of the other European nations; read them not with a view to amu&s;e, but to improve your mind; and to that end make reflexions on what you have read, which may be u&s;eful to your&s;elf, and will render your conver&s;ation agreeable to others.&mdash; Learn &s;o much of <HI>geography</HI> as to form a ju&s;t idea of the &s;ituation of places, mentioned in any au|thor: and this will make hi&s;tory more entertaining to you.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary for you to be perfect in <HI>the fir&s;t four rules of arithmetic:</HI> more you can never have occa|&s;ion for, and the mind &s;hould not be burdened with needle&s;s application.&mdash;<HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> and <HI>drawing</HI> are accom|pli&s;hments well worth the trouble of attaining, if your inclination and genius lead to either: if not, do not attempt them; for it will be only much time and great labour unprofitably thrown away; it being next to impo&s;&s;ible to arrive at any degree of perfection in

<P>The&s;e, my dear, are but a few of tho&s;e mental im|provements I would recommend to you. Indeed there is no branch of knowledge that your capacity is equal to, and which you have an opportunity of acquiring, that, I think, ought to be neglected. It has been ob|jected again&s;t all female learning, beyond that of hou&s;ehold economy, that it tends only to fill the minds of the &s;ex with a conceited vanity, which &s;ets them above their proper bu&s;ine&s;s; occa&s;ions an in|difference to, if not a total neglect of, their family affairs; and &s;erves only to render them u&s;ele&s;s wives, and impertinent companions. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;ome reading ladies have given but too much cau&s;e for this objection; and could it be proved to hold good throughout the &s;ex, it would certainly be right to confine their improvements within the nar|row limits of the nur&s;ery, of the kitchen, and the confectionary: but, I believe, it will, upon examina|tion, be found, that &s;uch ill con&s;equences proceed chiefly from too great an imbecility of mind to be ca|pable of much enlargement, or from a mere affecta|tion of knowledge, void of all reality. Vanity is never the re&s;ult of under&s;tanding. A &s;en&s;ible woman will &s;oon be convinced, that all the learning her ut|mo&s;t application can make her mi&s;tre&s;s of, will be, from the difference of education, in many points, in|ferior to that of a &s;choolboy: this reflexion will keep her always humble, and will be an effectual check to
<PB N="137" REF="024452_0134_0FC73E1BB93946D8">
that loquacity which renders &s;ome women &s;uch in|&s;upportable companions.</P>
<P>The management of all dome&s;tic affairs is certainly the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of woman; and, unfa&s;hionably ru&s;tic as &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion may be thought, it is not beneath the dignity of any lady, however high her rank, to know <HI>how</HI> to educate her children, to go|vern her &s;ervants; how to order an elegant table with economy, and to manage her whole family with prudence, regularity, and method. If in the&s;e &s;he is defective, whatever may be her attainments in any other kinds of knowledge, &s;he will act out of cha|racter; and, by not moving in her proper &s;phere, &s;he will become rather the object of ridicule than of ap|probation. But I believe it may with truth be af|firmed, that the neglect of the&s;e dome&s;tic concerns has much more frequently proceeded from an exor|bitant love of diver&s;ions, from a ridiculous fondne&s;s for dre&s;s and gallantry, or from a mi&s;taken pride, that has placed &s;uch duties in a &s;ervile light, from whence they have been con&s;idered as fit only for the employment of dependants, and below the attention of a fine lady, than from too great an attachment to mental improvements: yet, from what&s;oever cau&s;e &s;uch a neglect proceeds, it is equally unju&s;tifiable. If any thing can be urged in vindication of a cu&s;tom unknown to our ance&s;tors, which the prevalence of fa&s;hion has made &s;o general among the modern ladies; I mean, that of committing to the care and di&s;cre|tionary power of different &s;ervants, the &s;ole manage|ment of family affairs: nothing, certainly, can be al|leged in defence of &s;uch an ignorance, in things of this nature, as renders a lady incapable of giving proper directions on all occa&s;ions; an ignorance, which, in ever &s;o exalted a &s;tation, will render her contemptible, even to tho&s;e &s;ervants, on who&s;e under|&s;tanding and fidelity &s;he, in fact, becomes dependent for the regularity of her hou&s;e, for the propriety, elegance, and frugality of her table: which la&s;t arti|cle is &s;eldom regarded by &s;uch &s;ort of people, who too frequently impo&s;e on tho&s;e by whom they are
<PB N="138" REF="024452_0135_0FC73E1E54074608">
thus implicitly tru&s;ted. Make your&s;elf, therefore, &s;o thoroughly requainted with the mo&s;t proper method of conducting a family, and with the nece&s;&s;ary ex|pen&s;e which every article, in proportion to their number, will occa&s;ion, that you may come to a rea|&s;onable certainty of not being materially deceived, without the ridiculous drudgery of following your &s;ervants continually, and meanly peeping into every ob&s;cure corner of your hou&s;e: nor is this at all dif|ficult to attain, as it requires nothing more than an attentive ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>It is of late, in mo&s;t great families, become too much the cu&s;tom, to be long upon the books of every trade&s;man they employ. To a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for this is foreign to my purpo&s;e; but I am certain it would, in general, be better both for them&s;elves, and for the people they deal with, never to be on them at all; and what difficulty or inconvenience can ari&s;e, in a well-regulated family, from commi&s;&s;ioning the &s;tew|ard or hou&s;e-keeper to pay for every thing at the time when it is brought in? This ob&s;olete practice, though in it&s;elf very laudable, is not at pre&s;ent, and perhaps never may be again, authori&s;ed by fa&s;hion: however, let it be a rule with you to contract as few debts as po&s;&s;ible: mo&s;t things are to be purcha&s;ed both better in their kind, and at a lower price, by paying for them at the time of purcha&s;ing. But if, to avoid the &s;uppo&s;ed trouble of frequent trifling di&s;bur&s;ements, you choo&s;e to have the le&s;&s;er articles thrown together in a bill, let a note of the quantity and price be brought with every &s;uch parcel: file the&s;e notes, compare them with the bill when deli|vered in, and let &s;uch bills be regularly paid every quarter: for it is not rea&s;onable to expect, that a trade&s;man &s;hould give longer credit, without making up the intere&s;t of his money by an advanced price on what he &s;ells: and be a&s;&s;ured, if you find it incon|venient to pay at the end of three months, that in|convenience mu&s;t ari&s;e from living at too great an expen&s;e, and will con&s;equently increa&s;e in &s;ix months, and grow &s;till greater at the end of the year. By

making &s;hort payments, you will become the &s;ooner &s;en&s;ible of &s;uch a mi&s;take, and you will find it at fir&s;t more ea&s;y to retrench any &s;upernumeraries than af|ter having been long habituated to them.</P>
<P>If your hou&s;e is &s;uperintended by an hou&s;e-keeper, and your &s;ervants are accountable to her, let your hou&s;e-keeper be accountable to your&s;elf, and let her be entirely governed by your directions. Carefully examine her bills, and &s;uffer no extravagances or un|nece&s;&s;ary articles to pa&s;s unnoticed. Let the&s;e bills be brought to you every morning: what they contain will then be ea&s;ily recollected without burdening your memory; and your accounts being &s;hort will be adju&s;ted with le&s;s trouble and with more exactne&s;s. Should you at any time have an upper &s;ervant, who&s;e family and education were &s;uperior to that &s;tate of &s;ubjection to which &s;ucceeding misfortunes may have reduced her, &s;he ought to be treated with peculiar indulgence: if &s;he has under&s;tanding enough to be conver&s;ible, and humility enough always to keep her proper di&s;tance, le&s;&s;en, as much as po&s;&s;ible, every painful remembrance of former pro&s;pects, by look|ing on her as an humble friend, and making her an occa&s;ional companion. But never de&s;cend to conver&s;e with tho&s;e who&s;e birth, education, and early views in life were not &s;uperior to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude; their minds being in general &s;uited to their &s;tation, they are apt to be intoxicated by any degree of familiari|ty, and to become u&s;ele&s;s and impertinent. The ha|bit, which very many ladies have contracted, of talk|ing to and con&s;ulting with their women, has &s;o &s;poil|ed that &s;et of &s;ervants, that few of them are to be met with, who do not commence their &s;ervice by giv|ing their una&s;ked opinion of your per&s;on, dre&s;s, or management, artfully conveyed in the too generally accepted vehicle of flattery; and, if they are allow|ed in this, they will next proceed to offer their ad|vice on any occa&s;ion that may happen to di&s;compo&s;e or ruffle your temper: check, therefore, the fir&s;t appearance of &s;uch impertinence, by a reprimand &s;ufficiently &s;evere to prevent a repetition of it.</P>

Some of the&s;e hours may be very agreeably and u&s;efully employed by entertaining books; a few of which, in the Engli&s;h language, I will mention to you, as a &s;pe|cimen of the kind I would recommend to your peru|&s;al; and I &s;hall include &s;ome others, religious and in&s;tructive.</P>

<P>From the&s;e you may form a judgment of that &s;ort of reading which will be both u&s;eful and entertain|ing to you. I have named only tho&s;e <HI>practical &s;er|mons,</HI> which, I thought, would more directly influ|ence your conduct in life. <HI>Our rule of faith</HI> &s;hould be taken from the &s;cripture alone, which we mu&s;t under&s;tand for our&s;elves; therefore the controverted opinions of others &s;erve, in general, rather to puz|zle than to improve the mind.</P>
<P>Of <HI>novels</HI> and <HI>romances,</HI> very few are worth the trouble of reading: &s;ome of them, perhaps, do con|tain a few good morals; but they are not worth the finding, where &s;o much rubbi&s;h is intermixed. Their moral parts, indeed, are like &s;mall diamonds among mountains of dirt and tra&s;h, which, after you have found them, are too incon&s;iderable to an&s;wer the pains of coming at; yet, ridiculous as the&s;e fictitious tales generally are, they are &s;o artfully managed as to excite an idle curio&s;ity to &s;ee the conclu&s;ion, by which means the reader is drawn on, through a tire|&s;ome length of fooli&s;h adventures, from which nei|ther knowledge, plea&s;ure, or profit, can accrue, to the common cata&s;trophe of a wedding. The mo&s;t I have met with of the&s;e writings, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, it is little better than the lo&s;s of time to peru&s;e. But &s;ome of them have more pernicious con&s;equen|ces. By drawing characters that never exi&s;t in life, by repre&s;enting per&s;ons and things in a fal&s;e and ex|travagant light, and by a &s;eries of improbable cau&s;es
<PB N="145" REF="024452_0142_0FC73E32F8C5FF20">
bringing on impo&s;&s;ible events, they are apt to give a romantic turn to the mind, which is often productive of great errors in judgment, and of fatal mi&s;takes in conduct. Of this I have &s;een frequent in&s;tances, and therefore advi&s;e you &s;carcely ever to meddle with any of them.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice, however, to a late ingenious author, this letter mu&s;t not be reprinted, without my acknow|ledging that, &s;ince the la&s;t edition was publi&s;hed, I have accidentally met with one exception to my ge|neral rule, namely, <HI>The Vicar of Wakefield.</HI> That novel is equally entertaining and in&s;tructive, without being liable to any of the objections that occa&s;ioned the above re&s;triction. This po&s;&s;ibly may not be the only exceptionable piece of the kind; but as I have not met with any other, among a number I have peru&s;ed, a &s;ingle in&s;tance does not alter my opinion of that &s;ort of writing; and I &s;till think, the chance is perhaps a thou&s;and to one again&s;t the probability of obtaining the &s;malle&s;t degree of advantage from the reading any of them, as well as that very few are to be found, from which much injury may not be received.</P>
<P>Works of the needle, that employ the fancy, may, if they &s;uit your inclination, be &s;ometimes a pretty amu&s;ement: but let this employment never extend to large pieces, beyond what can be accompli&s;hed by your&s;elf without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. There is not a great|er extravagance under the &s;pecious name of good hou&s;ewifery, than the furni&s;hing of hou&s;es in this manner. Whole apartments have been &s;een thus ornamented by the &s;uppo&s;ed work of a lady, who, perhaps, never &s;haded two leaves in the artificial fore&s;t, but has paid four times its value to the &s;ever|al people employed in bringing it to perfection. The expen&s;e of the&s;e tedious pieces of work I &s;peak of experimentally, having, many years pa&s;t, undertaken one of them, which, when fini&s;hed, was not worth fifteen pounds; and by a computation &s;ince made, it did not co&s;t le&s;s than fifty, in the hire and mainte|nance of the people employed in it. This, indeed,
<PB N="146" REF="024452_0143_0FC73E39C4E2B798">
was at the age of &s;eventeen, when the thoughtle&s;s inexperience of youth could alone excu&s;e &s;uch a piece of folly.&mdash;<HI>Embroideries in gold, &s;ilver, or &s;hades of &s;ilk,</HI> come within a narrower compa&s;s. Works of that kind, which may, without calling in expen&s;ive a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or tiring the fancy, be fini&s;hed in a &s;ummer, will be a well-cho&s;en change of amu&s;ement, and may, as there are three of you, be made much more agreeable, by one alternately reading aloud, while the other two are thus employed.&mdash;All kinds of what is called <HI>plain-work,</HI> though no very polite accompli&s;hment, you mu&s;t be &s;o well ver&s;ed in, as to be able to cut out, make, and mend your own linen. Some fathers, and &s;ome hu&s;bands, choo&s;e to have their daughters and their wives thus attired in the labour of their own hands, and, from a mi&s;taken notion, believe this to be the great criterion of frugal economy. Where that happens to be the inclination or opinion of either, it ought always to be readily complied with: but, exclu&s;ive of &s;uch a motive, I &s;ee no other that makes the practical part nece&s;&s;ary to any lady; excepting, indeed, where there is &s;uch a narrow|ne&s;s of fortune as admits not conveniently the keep|ing a &s;ervant, to whom &s;uch exerci&s;es of the needle much more properly appertain.</P>
<P>The theatre, which, by the indefatigable labour of the inimitable Mr. Garrick, has been brought to very great perfection, will afford you an equally rational and improving entertainment. Your judgment will not now be called in que&s;tion, your under&s;tanding affronted, nor will your mode&s;ty be offended by the indecent ribaldry of tho&s;e authors, who, to their de|fect in wit, have added the want of good &s;en&s;e and of good manners. Faults of this kind, which, from a blameable compliance with a corrupted ta&s;te, have &s;ometimes crept into the works of good wri|ters, are, by his prudent direction, generally recti|fied or omitted on the &s;tage. You may now &s;ee ma|ny of the be&s;t plays performed in the be&s;t manner. Do not, however, go to any that you have not be|fore heard the character of: be pre&s;ent only at tho&s;e
<PB N="147" REF="024452_0144_0FC73E3C944EC6B8">
which are approved by per&s;ons of under&s;tanding and virtue, as calculated to an&s;wer the proper end of the theatre, namely, that of conveying in&s;truction in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing method. Attend to the &s;entiment, apply the moral, and then you cannot, I think, pa&s;s an evening in a more u&s;eful, or in a more entertain|ing diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Dancing may al&s;o take its turn, as a healthful exerci&s;e, as it is generally &s;uitable to the ta&s;te and gaiety of young minds.</P>
<P>Part of the hours appropriated to relaxation mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be le&s;s agreeably taken up in the paying and receiving vi&s;its of mere ceremony and civility; a tribute, by cu&s;tom authorized, by good manners enjoined. In <HI>the&s;e,</HI> when the conver&s;ation is only in&s;ignificant, join in it with an apparent &s;atisfaction. Talk of the elegance of a birth-day &s;uit, the pattern of a lace, the judicious a&s;&s;ortment of jewels, the cut of a ruffle, or the &s;et of a &s;leeve, with an unaffected ea&s;e; not according to the rank they hold in your e&s;|timation, but proportioned to the con&s;equence they may be of in the opinion of tho&s;e you are conver&s;ing with. The great art of plea&s;ing is to appear plea&s;ed with others; &s;uffer not then an ill-bred ab&s;ence of thought, or a contemptuous &s;neer, ever to betray a con&s;cious &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding, always pro|ductive of ill-nature and di&s;like. Suit your&s;elf to the capacity and to the ta&s;te of your company, when that ta&s;te is confined to harmle&s;s trifles: but where it is &s;o far depraved as to delight in cruel &s;arca&s;ms on the ab&s;ent, to be plea&s;ed with di&s;covering the blemi&s;hes in a good character, or in repeating the greater faults of a bad one, religion and humanity in that ca&s;e forbid the lea&s;t degree of a&s;&s;ent. If you have not any knowledge of the per&s;ons thus unhap|pily &s;acrificed to envy or to malice, and con&s;equently are ignorant as to the truth or fal&s;ehood of &s;uch a&s;per|&s;ions, always &s;u&s;pect them to be ill-grounded, or, at lea&s;t, greatly exaggerated. Show your di&s;appro|bation by a &s;ilent gravity, and by taking the fir&s;t op|portunity to change the &s;ubject. But where any ac|quaintance
<PB N="148" REF="024452_0145_0FC73E3DD1E8C720">
with the character in que&s;tion gives room for defending it, let not an ill-timed complai&s;ance prevail over ju&s;tice: vindicate injured innocence with all the freedom and warmth of an unre&s;trained bene|volence; and where the faults of the guilty will ad|mit of palliation, urge all that truth can allow in mitigation of error. From this method, be&s;ides the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a &s;trict con|formity to the great rule of <HI>doing as you would be done by,</HI> you will al&s;o reap to your&s;elf the benefit of being le&s;s fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uently pe&s;tered with themes ever painful to a humane di&s;po&s;ition. If, unfortunately, you have &s;ome acquaintance, who&s;e malevolence of heart no &s;entiment of virtue, no check of good-manners, can re&s;train from the&s;e malicious &s;allies of ill-nature, to them let your vi&s;its be made as &s;eldom, and as &s;hort as decency will permit; there being neither benefit nor &s;atisfaction to be found in &s;uch company, among whom only cards may be introduced with any advan|tage. On this account, it will be proper for you to know how to play at the games mo&s;t in u&s;e; becau&s;e it is an argument of great folly to engage in any thing without doing it well; but this is a diver&s;ion which, I hope, you will have no fondne&s;s for, as it is in it&s;elf, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, a very in&s;ignificant amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>With per&s;ons for whom you can have no e&s;teem, good-breeding may oblige you to keep up an inter|cour&s;e of ceremonious vi&s;its; but politene&s;s enjoins not the length or frequency of them. Here inclina|tion may be followed without a breach of civility: there is no tax upon intimacy but from choice; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> choice &s;hou'd ever be founded on merit, the certainty whereof you cannot be too careful in pre|viou&s;ly examining. Great caution is nece&s;&s;ary not to be deceived by &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious appearances. A plau&s;ible behaviour often, upon a &s;uperficial knowledge, cre|ates a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of particulars, who, upon a nearer view, may be found to have no claim to e&s;teem. The forming a precipitate judgment &s;ometimes leads into an unwary intimacy, which it
<PB N="149" REF="024452_0146_0FC73E3F03C77BC8">
may prove ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to break off: and yet that breach may be attended with innumerable in|conveniences; nay, perhaps, with very material and la&s;ting ill con&s;equences: prudence, therefore, here enjoins the greate&s;t circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>Few people are capable of friend&s;hip; and &s;till fewer have all the qualifications one would choo&s;e in a friend. The fundamental point is a virtuous di&s;|po&s;ition; but to that &s;hould be added a good under|&s;tanding, a &s;olid judgment, &s;weetne&s;s of temper, &s;tea|dine&s;s of mind, freedom of behaviour, and &s;incerity of heart. Seldom as the&s;e are to be found united, never make a bo&s;om friend of any one greatly defici|ent in either. Be &s;low in contracting friend&s;hip, and invariably con&s;tant in maintaining it. Expect not many friends, but think your&s;elf happy, if, through life, you meet with one or two who de&s;erve that name, and have all the requi&s;ites for the valuable re|lation. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may ju&s;tly be deemed the highe&s;t ble&s;|&s;ing of mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lity. Uninterrupted health has the ge|neral voice; but in my opinion, &s;uch an intercour&s;e of friend&s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s much de&s;erves the preference, as the mental plea&s;ures, both in nature and degree, exceed the corporeal. The weakne&s;&s;es, the pains of the body may be inexpre&s;&s;ibly alleviated by the conver|&s;ation of a per&s;on, by affection endeared, by rea&s;on approved&mdash;who&s;e tender &s;ympathy partakes your af|flictions, and &s;hares your enjoyments&mdash;who is &s;teady in the correction, but mild in the reproof of your faults&mdash;like a guardian angel, ever watchful to warn you of unfore&s;een danger, and, by timely admoni|tions, to prevent the mi&s;takes incident to human frailty and to &s;elf-partiality: this is the true office of friend&s;hip. With &s;uch a friend, no &s;tate of life can be ab&s;olutely unhappy; but, de&s;titute of &s;ome &s;uch connexion, heaven has &s;o formed our nature for this intimate &s;ociety, that amid&s;t the affluence of fortune, and in the flow of uninterrupted health, there will be an aching void in the &s;olitary brea&s;t, which can never otherwi&s;e know a plenitude of happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="024452_0147_0FC73E4145D47268">Should the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all events be&s;tow on you this &s;uperlative gift, to &s;uch a friend let your heart be ever unre&s;ervedly open.

<P>Happy is her lot, who in a hu&s;band finds this in|valuable friend! Yet &s;o great is the hazard, &s;o di&s;|proportioned the chances, that I could almo&s;t wi&s;h the dangerous die was never to be thrown for any of you: but as probably it may, let me conjure you all, my dear girls, if ever any of you take this mo&s;t im|portant &s;tep in life, to proceed with the utmo&s;t care and with deliberate circum&s;pection. Fortune and family it is the &s;ole province of your father to direct in: he, certainly, has always an undoubted right to a negative voice, though not to a compul&s;ive one. As a child is very ju&s;tifiable in the refu&s;al of her hand, even to the ab&s;olute command of a father, where her heart cannot go with it; &s;o is &s;he extremely culpa|ble in giving it, contrary to his approbation. Here I mu&s;t take &s;hame to my&s;elf; and for this unpardon|able fault, I do ju&s;tly acknowledge that the &s;ub&s;e|quent ill con&s;equences of a mo&s;t unhappy marriage were the proper puni&s;hment. This, and every other error in my own conduct, I do, and &s;hall, with the utmo&s;t candour, lay open to you; &s;incerely praying that you may reap the benefit of my experience, and that you may avoid tho&s;e rocks, which, either by carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or &s;ometimes, alas, by too much caution, I have &s;plit again&s;t! But to return:&mdash;</P>
<P>The chief point, to be regarded in the choice of <HI>a companion for life,</HI> is a really virtuous principle, an unaffected goodne&s;s of heart. Without this, you will
<PB N="151" REF="024452_0148_0FC73E4795728250">
be continually &s;hocked by indecency, and pained by impiety. So numerous have been the unhappy vic|tims to the ridiculous opinion, "<HI>A reformed libertine makes the be&s;t hu&s;band<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>" that, did not experience dai|ly evince the contrary, one would believe it impo&s;|&s;ible for a girl, who has a tolerable degree of com|mon under&s;tanding, to be made the dupe of &s;o erro|neous a po&s;ition, which has not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of rea&s;on for its foundation, and which a &s;mall &s;hare of ob&s;ervation will prove to be fal&s;e in fact. A man, who has been long conver&s;ant with the wor&s;t &s;ort of women, is very apt to contract a bad opinion of, and a contempt for, the &s;ex in general. Incapable of e&s;|teeming any, he is &s;u&s;picious of all&mdash;jealous without cau&s;e&mdash;angry without provocation&mdash;and his own di&s;|turbed imagination is a continual &s;ource of ill hu|mour. To this is frequently joined a bad habit of body, the natural con&s;equence of an irregular life, which gives an additional &s;ourne&s;s to the temper. What rational pro&s;pect of happine&s;s can there be with &s;uch a companion? And that this is the general character of tho&s;e who are called reformed rakes, ob&s;ervation will certify. But, admit there may be &s;ome exceptions, it is a hazard upon which no con|&s;iderate woman would venture the peace of her whole future life. The vanity of tho&s;e girls, who believe them&s;elves capable of working miracles of this kind, and who give up their per&s;ons to men of libertine principles, upon the wild expectation of reclaiming them, ju&s;tly de&s;erves the di&s;appointment which it will generally meet with; for, believe me, a wife is, of all per&s;ons, the lea&s;t likely to &s;ucceed in &s;uch an attempt. Be it your care to find that virtue in a lover, which you mu&s;t never hope to form in a hu&s;|band. Good-&s;en&s;e and good-nature are almo&s;t equal|ly requi&s;ite. If the former is wanting, it will be next to impo&s;&s;ible for you to e&s;teem the per&s;on, of who&s;e behaviour you have cau&s;e to be a&s;hamed; and mutual e&s;teem is as nece&s;&s;ary to happine&s;s in the mar|ried &s;tate as mutual affection: without the latter, every day will bring with it &s;ome fre&s;h cau&s;e of vex|ation;

'till repeated quarrels produce a coldne&s;s, which will &s;ettle into an irreconcileable aver&s;ion, and you will become not only each other's torment, but the object of contempt to your family and to your ac|quaintance.</P>
<P>This quality of good-nature is, of all others, the mo&s;t difficult to be a&s;certained, on account of the general mi&s;take of blending it with good-humour, as if they were in them&s;elves the &s;ame; whereas, in fact, no two principles of action are more e&s;&s;entially different. And this may require &s;ome explanation.&mdash; By good-nature I mean, that true benevol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce which partakes in the felicity of all mankind; which promotes the &s;atisfaction of every individual within the reach of its ability; which relieves the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, comforts the afflicted, diffu&s;es ble&s;&s;ings, and communicates hap|pine&s;s, as far as its &s;phere of action can extend; and which, in the private &s;eenes of life, will &s;hine con|&s;picuous in the dutiful &s;on, the affectionate hu&s;band, the indulgent father, the faithful friend, and the compa&s;&s;ionate ma&s;ter both to man and bea&s;t: while good humour is nothing more than a cheerful, plea&s;|ing deportment, ari&s;ing either from a natural gaiety of mind, or from an affectation of popularity, join|ed to an affability of behaviour, the re&s;ult of good-breeding, and a ready compliance with the ta&s;te of every company. This kind of mere good-humour is, by far, the mo&s;t &s;triking quality; 'tis frequently mi&s;taken for, and complimented with, the &s;uperior name of real good-nature. A man by this &s;pecious appearance has often acquired that appellation, who, in all the actions of his private life, has been a mo|ro&s;e, cruel, revengeful, &s;ullen, haughty tyrant. Let them put on the cap, who&s;e temples fit the galling wreath! On the contrary, a man of a truly benevo|lent di&s;po&s;ition, and formed to promote the happine&s;s of all round him, may &s;ometimes, perhaps from an ill habit of body, an accidental vexation, or from a commendable openne&s;s of heart, above the meanne&s;s of di&s;gui&s;e, be guilty of little &s;allies of peevi&s;hne&s;s, or of ill-humour, which, carrying the appearance of

ill-nature, may be unju&s;tly thought to proceed from it, by per&s;ons who are unacquainted with his true cha|racter, and who take ill-humour and ill-nature to be &s;ynonimous terms, though, in reality, they bear not the lea&s;t analogy to each other. In order to the forming a right judgment, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve this di&s;tinction, which will effectually &s;e|cure you from the dangerous error of taking the &s;hadow for the &s;ub&s;tance; an irretrievable mi&s;take, pregnant with innumerable con&s;equent evils!</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it plainly appears, that the crite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on of this amiable virtue is not to be tak|en from the general opinion; mere good-humour be|ing, to all intents and purpo&s;es, &s;ufficient in this par|ticular to e&s;tabli&s;h the public voice in favour of a man utterly devoid of every humane and benevolent affection of heart. It is only from the le&s;s con&s;picu|ous &s;cenes of life, the more retired &s;phere of action, from the artle&s;s tenor of dome&s;tic conduct, that the real character can with any certainty be drawn. The&s;e, undi&s;gui&s;ed, proclaim the man: but, as they &s;hun the glare of light, nor court the noi&s;e of popu|lar applau&s;e, they pa&s;s unnoticed, and are &s;eldom known 'till after an intimate acquaintance. The be&s;t method, therefore, to avoid deception in this ca&s;e, is to lay no &s;tre&s;s on outward appearances, which are too often fallacious, but to take the rule of judging from the &s;imple, unpoli&s;hed &s;entiments of tho&s;e, who&s;e dependent connexions give them an un|deniable certainty; who not only &s;ee, but hourly feel the good or bad effects of that di&s;po&s;ition to which they are &s;ubjected. By this I mean, that if a man is equally re&s;pected, e&s;teemed, and beloved by his tenants, by his dependents and dome&s;tics&mdash;from the &s;ub&s;tantial farmer to the laborious pea&s;ant&mdash;from the proud &s;teward to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive wretch, who, thankful for employment, humbly obeys the menial tribe&mdash;you may ju&s;tly con|clude he has that true good-nature, that real bene|volence, which delights in communicating felicity, and enjoys the &s;atisfaction it diffu&s;es. But if by the&s;e he is de&s;pi&s;ed and hated, &s;erved merely from a
<PB N="154" REF="024452_0151_0FC73E4F7B520130">
principle of fear, devoid of affection&mdash;which is very ea&s;ily di&s;coverable&mdash;whatever may be his public cha|racter, however favourable the general opinion, be a&s;&s;ured, that his di&s;po&s;ition is &s;uch as can never be productive of dome&s;tic happine&s;s.&mdash;I have been the more particular on this head, as it is one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential qualifications to be regarded, and of all others the mo&s;t liable to be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Never be prevailed with, my dear, to give your hand to a per&s;on, defective in the&s;e material points. Secure of virtue, of good-nature, and under&s;tanding in a hu&s;band, you may be &s;ecure of happine&s;s. With|out the two former, it is unattainable: without the latter, in a tolerable degree, it mu&s;t be very imperfect.</P>
<P>Remember, however, that infallibility is not the property of man, or you may entail di&s;appointment on your&s;elf, by expecting what is never to be found. The be&s;t men are &s;ometimes incon&s;i&s;tent with them|&s;elves. They are liable to be hurried, by &s;udden &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion, into expre&s;&s;ions and actions which their cooler rea&s;on will condemn. They may have &s;ome oddities of behaviour, &s;ome peculiarities of temper; they may be &s;ubject to accidental ill-humour, or to whim&s;ical complaints blemi&s;hes of this kind of|ten &s;hade the brighte&s;t character: but they are never de&s;tructive of mutual felicity, unle&s;s when they are made &s;o by an improper re&s;entment, or by an ill-judged oppo&s;ition. Rea&s;on can never be heard by pa&s;&s;ion; the offer of it tends only to inflame the more. When cooled, and in his u&s;ual temper, the man of under&s;tanding, if he has been wrong, will &s;ugge&s;t to him&s;elf all that could be urged again&s;t him: the man of good-nature will, un-upbraided, own his error: immediate contradiction is, therefore, wholly un&s;erviceable, and highly imprudent; and after repe|tition equally unnece&s;&s;ary and injudicious. Any pe|culiarities in the temper or behaviour ought to be properly repre&s;ented in the tendere&s;t and in the mo&s;t friendly manner, and if the repre&s;entation of them is made di&s;creetly, it will generally be well taken: but if they are &s;o habitual as not ea&s;ily to be altered,

&s;trike not too often upon the unharmonious &s;tring: rather let them pa&s;s as unob&s;erved: &s;uch a chearful compliance will better cement your union; and they may be made ea&s;y to your&s;elf, by reflecting on the &s;uperior good qualities by which the&s;e trifling faults are &s;o greatly overbalanced.&mdash;You mu&s;t remember, my dear, the&s;e rules are laid down, on the &s;uppo&s;i|tion of your being united to a per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the three e&s;&s;ential qualifications for happine&s;s before-mentioned. In this ca&s;e, no farther direction is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, but that you &s;trictly perform the duty of a wife, namely, to love, to honour, and obey. The two fir&s;t articles are a tribute &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly due to merit, that they mu&s;t be paid by inclination; and they naturally lead to the performance of the la&s;t, which will not only be an ea&s;y but a plea&s;ing ta&s;k, &s;ince nothing can ever be enjoined by &s;uch a per&s;on that is in it&s;elf improper, and few things will, that can with any rea&s;on be di&s;agreeable to you.</P>
<P>Here &s;hould this &s;ubject end, were it not more than po&s;&s;ible for you, after all that has been urged, to be led by &s;ome inferior motive, to the neglect of the primary caution; and that, either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom an opinion too ha&s;tily entertained, from an unaccountable parti|ality, or from the powerful prevalence of per&s;ua&s;ion, you may be unfortunately induced to give your hand to a man who&s;e bad heart and moro&s;e temper, con|cealed by a well practi&s;ed di&s;&s;imulation, may render every flattering hope of happine&s;s abortive.&mdash;May heaven, in mercy, guard you from this fatal error!

But the bare po&s;&s;ibility of the event makes it not unnece&s;&s;ary to lay down a few rules for the maintaining &s;ome degree of ea&s;e, under &s;uch a de|privation of happine&s;s.

<P>The being united to a man of irreligious principles makes it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;charge a great part of the proper duty of a wife. To name but one in&s;tance, obedience will be rendered impracticable by frequent injunctions incon&s;i&s;tent with and contrary to the high|er obligations of morality. This is not &s;uppo&s;ition, but is founded upon facts, which I have too often &s;een and can atte&s;t. Where this happens, the rea&s;ons for non-compliance ought to be offered in a plain, &s;trong, good-natured manner; there is, at lea&s;t, the chance of &s;ucce&s;s from being heard; but &s;hould tho&s;e rea&s;ons be rejected, or the hearing of them be refu&s;ed, and &s;ilence on the &s;ubject enjoined&mdash;which is mo&s;t probable, few people caring to hear what they know to be right, when determined not to appear convinced by it&mdash;obey the injunction, and urge not the argument farther: keep, however, &s;teady to your principles, and &s;uffer neither per&s;ua&s;ion nor threats to prevail on you to act contary to them. All commands repugnant to the laws of chri&s;tianity, it is your indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to di&s;obey; all reque&s;ts that are incon&s;i&s;tent with pru|dence, or incompatible with the rank and character which you ought to maintain in life, it is your inte|re&s;t to refu&s;e. A compliance with the former would be criminal; a con&s;ent to the latter highly indi&s;creet; and it might thereby &s;ubject you to general cen&s;ure: for a man capable of requiring from his wife what he knows to be in it&s;elf wrong, is equally capable of throwing the whole blame of &s;uch mi&s;conduct on her, and of afterwards upbraiding her for a behaviour, to which he will, upon the &s;ame principle, di&s;own that he has been acce&s;&s;ary. Many &s;imilar in&s;tances have come within the compa&s;s of my own ob&s;ervation. In
<PB N="157" REF="024452_0154_0FC73E58756AED40">
things of a le&s;s material nature, that are neither cri|minal in them&s;elves nor pernicious in their con&s;equen|ces, always acquie&s;ce, if in&s;i&s;ted on, however di&s;a|greeable they may be to your own temper and incli|nation. Such a compliance will evidently prove that your refu&s;al in the other ca&s;es, proceeds not from a &s;pirit of contradiction, but merely from a ju&s;t regard to that &s;uperior duty, which can never be infringed with impunity. Pa&s;&s;ion may re&s;ent, but rea&s;on mu&s;t approve this conduct; and therefore it is the mo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> likely method, in time, to make a favourable impre&s;|&s;ion. But, if you &s;hould fail of &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, you will at lea&s;t enjoy that &s;atisfactory &s;elf-approbation, which is the in&s;eparable attendant of a truly religious and rational deportment.</P>
<P>Should the painful ta&s;k of dealing with a moro&s;e, tyrannical temper be a&s;&s;igned you, there is little more to be recommended, than a patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to an evil which admits not of a remedy. Ill-nature is increa&s;ed, ob&s;tinacy confirmed, by oppo&s;ition: the le&s;s &s;uch a temper is contradicted, the more &s;upporta|ble will it be to tho&s;e who are under its baneful in|fluence. When all endeavours to plea&s;e are ineffec|tual, and when a man &s;eems determined to find fault with every thing, as if his chief plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ted in tormenting tho&s;e about him, it requires a more than common degree of patience and re&s;olution to forbear uttering reproaches, which &s;uch a behaviour may be ju&s;tly allowed to de&s;erve: yet it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to the maintaining any tolerable degree of ea&s;e, not only to re&s;train all expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;entment, but to withhold even tho&s;e di&s;dainful looks which are apt to accompany a contemptuous &s;ilence; and they both equally tend only to increa&s;e the malady. This infernal delight in giving pain is mo&s;t unwearied in the &s;earch of matter for its gratification, and can ei|ther find, or unaccountably can form it, in almo&s;t all the occurrences of life; but, when &s;uffered, unob|&s;tructed and unregarded, to run its malicious cour&s;e, it will quickly vent its blunted arrows, and will die of di&s;appointment; while all endeavours to appea&s;e,
<PB N="158" REF="024452_0155_0FC73E5FBB181128">
all complaints of unkindne&s;s, will but &s;harpen again&s;t your&s;elf the weapon's edge, and, by proving your &s;en&s;ibility of the wound, will give the wi&s;hed-for &s;a|tisfaction to him who inflicts it. Prudence, in this ca&s;e, directs more than ordinary circum&s;pection, that every part of your behaviour may be as blamele&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, even to the ab&s;taining from the lea&s;t ap|pearance of evil; and after you have, to the utmo&s;t of your power, &s;trove to merit approbation, expect not to meet with it: by the&s;e means you will e&s;cape the mortification of being di&s;appointed, which, of|ten repeated, is apt to give a gloomy &s;ourne&s;s to the temper, incompatible with any degree of content|ment. You mu&s;t, &s;o &s;ituated, learn to be &s;atisfied with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of acting right, according to your be&s;t abilities, and, if po&s;&s;ible, you &s;hould look with an unconcerned indifference on the reception of eve|ry un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>This, it mu&s;t be owned, is a hard le&s;&s;on of philo&s;o|phy: it requires no le&s;s than an ab&s;olute command over the pa&s;&s;ions; but let it be remembered, that &s;uch a command will it&s;elf mo&s;t amply recompen&s;e every difficulty: it will compen&s;ate every pain, which it may co&s;t you to obtain it: be&s;ides, it is, I believe, the only way to pre&s;erve any tranquillity of mind, under &s;o di&s;agreeable a connexion.</P>
<P>As the want of under&s;tanding is by no art to be concealed, by no addre&s;s to be di&s;gui&s;ed, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed impo&s;&s;ible for a woman of &s;en&s;e to unite her|&s;elf to a per&s;on who&s;e defect, in this in&s;tance, mu&s;t render that &s;ort of rational &s;ociety which con&s;titutes the chief happine&s;s of &s;uch an union, impo&s;&s;ible; yet, here, how often has the weakne&s;s of female judgment been con&s;picuous! The advantages of great &s;uperiority in rank or fortune have frequently prov|ed &s;o irre&s;i&s;table a temptation, as, in opinion, to out|weigh not only the folly but even the vices of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: a grand mi&s;take, ever tacitly acknowledg|ed by a &s;ub&s;equent repentance, when the expected plea&s;ures of affluence, equipage, and all the glittering pomp of u&s;ele&s;s pageantry have been experimentally
<PB N="159" REF="024452_0156_0FC73E60C5DB1988">
found in&s;ufficient to make amends for the want of that con&s;tant &s;atisfaction, which re&s;ults from the &s;ocial joy of conver&s;ing with a rea&s;onable friend! But how|ever weak this motive mu&s;t be acknowledged, it is more excu&s;able than another, which, I fear, has &s;ometimes had an equal influence on the mind; I mean &s;o great a love of &s;way, as to induce her to give the preference to a per&s;on of weak intellectuals, in hopes thereby of holding, uncontrouled, the reins of government. The expectation is, in fact, ill-grounded ob&s;tinacy: and pride being generally the companion of folly, the &s;illie&s;t people are u&s;ually the mo&s;t tenacious of their opinions, and con&s;equent|ly, the harde&s;t of all others to be managed: but ad|mit the contrary, the principle is in it&s;elf bad: it tends to invert the order of nature, and to counter|act the de&s;ign of Providence.</P>
<P>A woman can never be &s;een in a more ridiculous light, than when &s;he appears to govern her hu&s;band. If, unfortunately, the &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding is on her &s;ide, the apparent con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of that &s;upe|riority betrays a weakne&s;s, that renders her con|temptible in the &s;ight of every con&s;iderate per&s;on, and it may, very probably, fix in his mind a di&s;like never to be eradicated. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, if it &s;hould ever be your own, remember that &s;ome degree of di&s;&s;imu|lation is commendable, &s;o far as to let your hu&s;band's defect appear unob&s;erved. When he judges wrong, never flatly contradict, but lead him in&s;en&s;ibly into another opinion, in &s;o di&s;creet a manner that it may &s;eem entirely his own; and let the whole credit of every prudent determination re&s;t on him, without in|dulging the fooli&s;h vanity of claiming any merit to your&s;elf. Thus a per&s;on of but an indifferent capa|city may be &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted as, in many in&s;tances, to &s;hine with a borrowed lu&s;tre, &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable from the native, and, by degrees, he may be brought into a kind of mechanical method of acting properly, in all the common occurrences of life. Odd as this po&s;ition may &s;eem, it is founded in fact; and I have &s;een the method &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed by more than
<PB N="160" REF="024452_0157_0FC73E623B130FE8">
one per&s;on, where a weak mind, on the governed &s;ide, has been &s;o prudently &s;et off as to appear the &s;ole director; like the &s;tatue of the Delphic god, which was thought to give forth its own oracles, while the humble prie&s;t, who lent his voice, was by the &s;hrine concealed, nor &s;ought a higher glory than a &s;uppo&s;ed obedience to the power he would be thought to &s;erve.</P>
<P>From hence it may be inferred, that by a perfect propriety of behaviour, ea&s;e and contentment, at lea&s;t, are attainable with a companion who has not the mo&s;t exalted under&s;tanding: but then, virtue and good-nature are pre&s;uppo&s;ed, or there will be nothing to work upon.</P>
<P>A vicious, ill-natured fool being &s;o untractable and tormenting an a&s;&s;ociate, there needs only to add jea|lou&s;y to the compo&s;ition, to make the cur&s;e complete. This pa&s;&s;ion, once &s;uffered to get footing in the heart, is hardly ever to be extirpated: it is a con&s;tant &s;ource of torment to the brea&s;t that gives it reception, and is an inexhau&s;tible fund of vexation to the object of it. With a per&s;on of this unfortunate di&s;po&s;ition, it is prudent to avoid the lea&s;t appearance of conceal|ment. A whi&s;per in a mixed company, a me&s;&s;age given in low voice to a &s;ervant, have, by the power of a di&s;turbed imagination, been magnified into a material injury. Whatever has the air of &s;ecrecy rai&s;es terror in a mind naturally di&s;tru&s;tful. A per|fect, unre&s;erved openne&s;s, both in conver&s;ation and behaviour, &s;tarves the anxious expectation of di&s;co|very, and may very probably lead into an habitual confidence, the only antidote again&s;t the poi&s;on of &s;u&s;picion. It is ea&s;ier to prevent than remove a re|ceived ill impre&s;&s;ion; and, con&s;equently, it is much wi&s;er to be &s;ometimes deficient in little points of civi|lity, which, however indifferent in them&s;elves, may happen unaccountably to cla&s;h with the ea&s;e of a per|&s;on, who&s;e repo&s;e it is both your duty and intere&s;t to promote. It is much more commendable, contented|ly to incur the cen&s;ure of a trifling di&s;po&s;ition, by a circum&s;tantial, una&s;ked relation of in&s;ignificant inci|dents,
<PB N="161" REF="024452_0158_0FC73E63B7B95D98">
than to give any room for apprehending the lea&s;t degree of re&s;erve. Such a con&s;tant method of proceeding, together with a rea&s;onable compliance, is the mo&s;t likely to cure this painful turn of mind; for, by with-holding every &s;upport that could give &s;trength to it, the want of matter to feed on may probably in time cau&s;e its extinction. If, unhappily, it is &s;o con|&s;titutional, &s;o interwoven with the &s;oul as to become, in a manner, in&s;eparably united with it, nothing re|mains but to &s;ubmit patiently to the will of heaven, under the pre&s;&s;ure of an unalterable evil; to guard carefully again&s;t the natural con&s;equence of repeated unde&s;erved &s;u&s;picions, namely, a growing indiffer|ence, which too frequently terminates in aver&s;ion; and, by con&s;idering &s;uch a &s;ituation as a trial of obe|dience and re&s;ignation, to receive the comfort that mu&s;t ari&s;e from properly exerci&s;ing one of the mo&s;t exalted of the chri&s;tian virtues. I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject without adding a particular caution <HI>to your&s;elf</HI> concerning it.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;y is, on &s;everal accounts, &s;till more inex|cu&s;able in a woman. There is not any thing that &s;o much expo&s;es her to ridicule, or &s;o much &s;ubjects her to the in&s;ult of affrontive addre&s;&s;es: it is an inlet to almo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible evil, the fatal &s;ource of innumer|able indi&s;cretions, the &s;ure de&s;truction of her own peace, and is frequently the bane of her hu&s;band's affection. Give not a momentary harbour to its &s;hadow in your heart; fly from it, as from the face of a fiend, that would lead your unwary &s;teps into a gulf of unalterable mi&s;ery. When once embarked in the matrimonial voyage, the fewer faults you di&s;|cover in your partner, the better. Never &s;earch after what it will give you no plea&s;ure to find; never de&s;ire to hear what you will not like to be told; therefore avoid that tribe of impertinents, who, either from a malicious love of di&s;cord, or from the meaner, though le&s;s criminal motive of ingratiating them&s;elves by gra|tifying the blameable curio&s;ity of others, &s;ow di&s;&s;en|tion wherever they gain admittance; and by telling unwelcome truths, or, more frequently, by in&s;inuat|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng

<P>In&s;tructions on this head, con&s;idering your tender age, may &s;eem premature, and &s;hould have been de|ferred, 'till occa&s;ion called for them, had our &s;ituation allowed me frequent opportunities of communicating my &s;entiments to you; but that not being the ca&s;e, I choo&s;e, in this epi&s;tle, at once to offer you my be&s;t advice in every circum&s;tance of great moment to your well being, both here and hereafter, le&s;t at a more proper &s;ea&s;on it may not happen to be in my power. You may defer the particular con&s;ideration of this part, 'till the de&s;ign of entering into a new &s;cene of life may make it u&s;eful to you; which, I hope, will not be for &s;ome years; an unhappy marriage being more generally the con&s;equence of a too early engage|ment, before rea&s;on has gained &s;ufficient &s;trength to form a &s;olid judgment, on which only a proper choice can be determined. Great is the hazard of a mi&s;take, and irretrievable the effects of it! Many are the de|grees between happine&s;s and mi&s;ery! Ab&s;olute mi&s;ery, I will venture to affirm, is to be avoided by a proper behaviour, even under all the complicated ills of hu|man life; but to arrive at that proper behaviour, re|quires the highe&s;t degree of chri&s;tian philo&s;ophy. And who would voluntarily put them&s;elves upon a &s;tate of trial &s;o &s;evere, in which not one of a thou&s;and has been found able to come off victorious? Between this and po&s;itive happine&s;s there are innumerable &s;teps of comparative evil; each has its &s;eparate conflict, variou&s;ly difficult, differently painful, under all which a patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and a con&s;cious propriety of beha|viour is the only attainable good. Far &s;hort, indeed, of po&s;&s;ible temporal felicity is the ea&s;e ari&s;ing from hence! Re&s;t not content with the pro&s;pect of &s;uch ea&s;e, but fix on a more eligible point of view, by aiming at true happine&s;s; and, take my word, <HI>that</HI> can never be found in a married &s;tate, without the three e&s;&s;ential qualifications already mentioned, vir|tue, good-nature, and good-&s;en&s;e, in a hu&s;band.

Remember, therefore, my dear girl, this repeated caution, if you ever re&s;olve on marriage, never to give your hand to a man who wants either of them, whatever other advantages he may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; &s;o &s;hall you not only e&s;cape all tho&s;e vexations which thou&s;ands of unthinking mortals hourly repent of hav|ing brought upon them&s;elves; but, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, if it is not your own fault, you will enjoy that uninter|rupted dome&s;tic harmony, in the affectionate &s;ociety of a virtuous companion, which con&s;titutes the high|e&s;t &s;atisfaction of human life. Such an union, found|ed on rea&s;on and religion, cemented by mutual e&s;teem and tenderne&s;s, is a kind of faint emblem, if the compari&s;on may be allowed, of the promi&s;ed reward of virtue in a future &s;tate; and mo&s;t certainly, it is an excellent preparative for it, by pre&s;erving a per|fect equanimity, by keeping a con&s;tant compo&s;ure of mind, which naturally lead to the proper di&s;charge of all the religious and &s;ocial duties of life, the un|erring road to everla&s;ting peace. The fir&s;t have been already &s;poken to; it remains only to mention &s;ome few of the latter.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e, ECONOMY may, perhaps, be thought improperly placed; yet many of the duties we owe to &s;ociety being often rendered impracticable by the want of it, there is not &s;o much impropriety in rank|ing it under this head, as may at fir&s;t be imagined. For in&s;tance, a man who lives at an expen&s;e beyond what his income will &s;upport, lays him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of being unju&s;t, by with-holding from his creditors what they have a right to demand from him as their due, according to all laws both human and divine: and thereby he often entails ruin on an innocent family, who, but for the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by his extravagance, might have comfortably &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the profits of their indu&s;try. He likewi&s;e puts it out of his own power to give that relief to the indi|gent, which, by the laws of humanity, they have a right to expect; the goods of fortune being given, as a great divine excellently ob&s;erves, for the u&s;e and &s;upport of others, as well as for the per&s;on on whom
<PB N="165" REF="024452_0162_0FC73E7159619EA0">
they are be&s;towed. The&s;e are &s;urely great breaches of that duty we owe to our fellow-creatures, and are effects very frequently and naturally produced by the want of economy.</P>
<P>You will find it a very good method, &s;o to regu|late your &s;tated expen&s;es as to bring them always one-fourth part within your certain annual income: by the&s;e means you will avoid being at any time di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed by unfore&s;een accidents, and you will have it more ea&s;ily in your power materially to relieve tho&s;e who de&s;erve a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But the giving trifling &s;ums, <HI>indi&s;criminately,</HI> to &s;uch as appear nece&s;&s;itous, is far from being commendable; it is an injury to &s;ociety; it is an encouragement to idlene&s;s, and helps to fill the &s;treets with lazy beggars, who live upon mi&s;ap|plied bounty, to the prejudice of the indu&s;trious poor. The&s;e are u&s;eful members of the commonwealth; and on them &s;uch benefactions might be &s;erviceably be|&s;towed. Be &s;paring, therefore, in this kind of indi&s;|criminate donations; they are too con&s;tantly an in|&s;ignificant relief to the receivers, &s;uppo&s;ing them really in want; and, frequently repeated, they amount to a con&s;iderable &s;um in the year's account. The proper objects of charity are tho&s;e, who by unavoid|able misfortunes have fallen from affluent circum|&s;tances into a &s;tate of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s; tho&s;e al|&s;o, who, by unexpected di&s;apointments in trade, are on the point of being reduced to an impo&s;&s;ibility of carrying on that bu&s;ine&s;s, on which their pre&s;ent &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence and their future pro&s;pect in life depend, from the incapacity of rai&s;ing an immediate &s;um to &s;ur|mount the difficulty; and tho&s;e who, by their utmo&s;t indu&s;try, can hardly &s;upport their families above the mi&s;eries of want; or who, by age or by illne&s;s, are ren|dered incapable of labour. Appropriate a certain part of your income to the relief of the&s;e real di&s;|tre&s;&s;es. To the fir&s;t, give as largely as your circum|&s;tances will allow; to the &s;econd, after the example of an excellent prelate of our own church, lend, if it is in your power, a &s;ufficient &s;um to prevent the threatened ruin, on condition of being repaid the
<PB N="166" REF="024452_0163_0FC73E72E015E5D0">
loan, without intere&s;t, if Providence enables them, by future &s;ucce&s;s, to do it with convenience. The &s;ame method may be u&s;ed where indigence renders indu&s;try unavailable, by depriving it of the means to lay in a &s;mall original &s;tock to be improved. Never take a note of hand or any acknowledgment of &s;uch loan, le&s;t what you intended for a benefit, &s;hould be afterwards made the in&s;trument of ruin to the re|ceiver, by a different di&s;po&s;ition in your &s;ucce&s;&s;or. But &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance ought not to be given to any, without a thorough knowledge of their character, and having good rea&s;on to believe them not only indu&s;|trious, but &s;trictly hone&s;t, which will be a &s;ufficient obligation on them for the repayment: and the &s;ums &s;o repaid ought to be laid by, 'till an opportunity again offers of making them in like manner &s;ervice|able to others. The latter &s;ort, who are able to work, may, by a &s;mall addition to the profits of their own labour, be re&s;cued from mi&s;ery, and may be put into a comfortable way of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Tho&s;e who, by age or by infirmity, are rendered utterly in|capable of &s;upporting them&s;elves, have an undoubted right, not only to the nece&s;&s;aries, but even to &s;ome of the conveniencies of life, from all, whom Provi|dence has placed in the more happy &s;tate of affluence and independence.</P>
<P>As your fortune and &s;ituation are yet undetermin|ed, I have purpo&s;ely laid down &s;uch rules as may be adapted to every &s;tation. A large fortune gives greater opportunity of doing good, and of communi|cating happine&s;s in a more exten&s;ive degree: but a &s;mall one is no excu&s;e for with-holding a proportion|ate relief from real and de&s;erving objects of compa&s;|&s;ion. To a&s;&s;i&s;t them is an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of chri|&s;tianity. The fir&s;t and great commandment is, to love God with all your heart; the &s;econd, to love your neighbour as your&s;elf: <HI>Who&s;o &s;eeth his brother in need, and &s;hutteth up his bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</HI> or how the love of his neighbour? If deficient in the&s;e primary duties, vain are the hopes of acceptance, built on a partial
<PB N="167" REF="024452_0164_0FC73E7AA84DCB78">
obedience to the le&s;&s;er branches of the law!&mdash;Inabi|lity is often pleaded as an excu&s;e for the want of charity, by per&s;ons who make no &s;cruple of daily la|vi&s;hing on their plea&s;ures, what, if better applied, might have made an indigent family happy through life. The&s;e per&s;ons lo&s;e &s;ight of real felicity, by the mi&s;taken pur&s;uit of its &s;hadow: the plea&s;ures, which engro&s;s their attention, die in the enjoyment, are often &s;ucceeded by remor&s;e, and always by &s;atiety; where|as the true joy, the &s;weet complacency re&s;ulting from benevolent actions, increa&s;es by reflexion, and mu&s;t be immortal as the &s;oul. So exactly, &s;o kindly is our duty more to coincide with our pre&s;ent as well as future intere&s;t, that incomparably more &s;atisfacti|on will accrue to a con&s;iderate mind from denying it|&s;elf even &s;ome of the agreeables of life, in order the more effectually to relieve the unfortunate, than could ari&s;e from a full indulgence of every temporal gratification.</P>
<P>However &s;mall your income may be, remember that a part of it is due to merit in di&s;tre&s;s. Set by an annual &s;um for this purpo&s;e, even though it &s;hould oblige you to abate &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e to rai&s;e the fund: by this method, per&s;ons of &s;lender fortune have been enabled to do much good, and to give happine&s;s to many. If your &s;tock will not admit of frequent draughts upon it, be the more circum&s;pect with regard to the merit of tho&s;e you relieve, that bounties, not in your power to repeat often, may not be mi&s;applied. But if Providence, by a more ample fortune, &s;hould ble&s;s you with a larger ability of being &s;erviceable to your fellow-creatures, prove your&s;elf worthy of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you, by making a pro|per u&s;e of it. Wide as your influence can extend, turn the cry of di&s;tre&s;s and danger into the &s;ong of joy and &s;afety; feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the afflicted, give medicine to the &s;ick, and, with either, be&s;tow all the alleviation their unfortu|nate circum&s;tances can admit of. Thus may you truly make a friend of the unrighteous mammon. Thus you may turn the peri&s;hable goods of fortune
<PB N="168" REF="024452_0165_0FC73E7DEBA53BA8">
into everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;ings. Upon earth you will par|take that happine&s;s you impart to others; and you will lay up for your&s;elf <HI>trea&s;ures in heaven, where neither moth nor ru&s;t can corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor &s;teal.</HI></P>
<P>A per&s;on who has once experienced the advan|tages of a right action, will be led by the motive of pre&s;ent &s;elf-intere&s;t, as well as by future expectation, to the continuance of it. There is no injunction of chri&s;tianity that a &s;incere chri&s;tian, by obedience, will not find &s;o calculated, as to be directly, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, its own reward.</P>
<P>The forgivene&s;s of injuries, to which is annexed the promi&s;e of pardon for our own offences, (and which is required by the go&s;pel, not only &s;o far as to forbear all kinds of retaliation, but al&s;o to render us equally di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve with our utmo&s;t power tho&s;e per&s;ons who have wilfully injured us, as if no &s;uch injury had been received from them) has by &s;ome been accounted a hard precept&punc; yet the difficulty of it ari&s;es merely from, and is proportionable to, the badne&s;s of the heart by which it is &s;o e&s;teemed. A good di&s;po&s;ition finds a &s;uperlative plea&s;ure in return|ing good for evil; and, by an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction of mind in &s;o doing, feels the pre&s;ent reward of obe|dience: whereas a &s;pirit of revenge is incompatible with happine&s;s, an implacable temper being a con&s;tant torment to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and the man who returns an injury, feels more real mi&s;ery from the rancour of his own heart, than it is in his power to inflict upon another.</P>
<P>Should a friend wound you in the mo&s;t tender part, by betraying a confidence repo&s;ed, prudence forbids the expo&s;ing your&s;elf to a &s;econd deception, by placing any future tru&s;t in &s;uch a per&s;on. But though here all obligations of intimacy cea&s;e, tho&s;e of benevolence and humanity remain &s;till in full force, and are equally binding, and call for every act of &s;ervice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, even to the &s;uffering a le&s;&s;er evil your&s;elf, in order to &s;ecure a much greater good to the per&s;on by whom you have been thus ill-u&s;ed. This
<PB N="169" REF="024452_0166_0FC73E7EF64C67E8">
is in general allowed to be the duty of every indivi|dual to all, as a member of &s;ociety; but it is particular|ly in&s;tanced in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to &s;how, that not even a breach of friend&s;hip, the highe&s;t of all provocations, will cancel the duty, at all times equally and unalter|ably binding&mdash;the duty of promoting both the tempo|ral and eternal happine&s;s of all your fellow creatures by every method in your power.</P>
<P>It has been by many thought impertinent at any time to offer una&s;ked advice; the rea&s;on of which maybe chiefly owing to its being too frequently ten|dered with a &s;upercilious air, that implies a conceited con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperior wi&s;dom: it is the manner, therefore, more than the thing it&s;elf, which gives di&s;|gu&s;t.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e, with whom you have any degree of inti|macy, are guilty of what to you appears either wrong or indi&s;creet, &s;peak your opinion to them with free|dom, though you &s;hould even lo&s;e a nominal friend by &s;o doing. Silence makes you, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an acce&s;&s;ary to the fault: but having thus once di&s;|charged your duty, re&s;t there: they are to judge for them&s;elves: to repeat &s;uch admonitions is both u&s;ele&s;s and impertinent, and they will then be thought to proceed rather from pride than from good nature. To the per&s;ons concerned only are you to &s;peak your di&s;approbation of their conduct: when they are cen|&s;ured by others, &s;ay all that truth or probability will permit in their ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>It often happens, that upon an accidental quarrel between friends, they &s;eparately appeal to a third per&s;on. In &s;uch ca&s;e, alternately take the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, alleging every argument in favour of the ab&s;ent party, and placing the mi&s;takes of the complainer in the &s;tronge&s;t light. This method may probably at fir&s;t di&s;plea&s;e, but is always right, as it is the mo&s;t likely to procure a reconciliation. If that takes place, each, equally obliged, will thankfully approve your conduct: if not, you will have the &s;atisfaction of, at lea&s;t, endeavouring to have been the re&s;torer of peace. A contrary behaviour, which generally proceeds
<PB N="170" REF="024452_0167_0FC73E8037C98268">
from the mean de&s;ire of plea&s;ing by flattery, at the expen&s;e of truth, often widens a trifling breach into open and irreconcileable enmity. People of this di&s;|po&s;ition are the wor&s;t &s;ort of incendiaries, the great|e&s;t plague of human &s;ociety, becau&s;e the mo&s;t diffi|cult to be guarded again&s;t, from their always wear|ing the &s;pecious di&s;gui&s;e of pretended approbation and friend&s;hip to the pre&s;ent, and equally deceitful re&s;entment again&s;t the ab&s;ent per&s;on or company.</P>
<P>To enumerate all the &s;ocial duties would lead me too far; &s;uffice it therefore, my dear, in a few words to &s;um up what remains.</P>
<P>Let truth ever dwell upon your tongue.</P>
<P>Scorn to flatter any, and de&s;pi&s;e the per&s;on who would practice &s;o ba&s;e an art upon your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Be hone&s;tly open in every part of your behaviour and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>All, with whom you have any intercour&s;e, even down to the meane&s;t &s;tation, have a right to civility and good-humour from you. A &s;uperiority of rank or fortune is no licen&s;e for a proud, &s;upercilious be|haviour: the di&s;advantages of a dependant &s;tate are alone &s;ufficient to labour under; 'tis both unju&s;t and cruel to increa&s;e them, either by a haughty deport|ment, or by the unwarrantable exerci&s;e of a caprici|ous temper.</P>
<P>Examine every part of your conduct towards others by the unerring rule of &s;uppo&s;ing a change of places. This will certainly lead to an impartial judgment. Do then what appears to you right, or, in other words, <HI>what you would th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;hould do unto you;</HI> which com|prehends every duty relative to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Aim at perfection, or you will never reach to an attainable height of virtue.</P>
<P>Be religious without hypocri&s;y, pious without en|thu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Endeavour to merit the favour of God by a &s;incere and uniform obedience to whatever you know, or be|lieve, to be his will; and &s;hould afflictive evils be permitted to cloud the &s;un-&s;hine of your brighte&s;t days, receive them with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; &s;atisfied that a

being equally wi&s;e, omni&s;cient, and beneficent, at once &s;ees and intends the good of his whole creation; and that every general or particular di&s;pen&s;ation of his providence, towards the rational part of it, is &s;o calculated as to be productive of ultimate happi|ne&s;s, which nothing but the mi&s;behaviour of indivi|duals can prevent to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This truth is &s;urely an unan&s;werable argument for ab&s;olute re&s;ignation to the will of God; and &s;uch a re&s;ignation, founded upon rea&s;on and choice, not enforced by nece&s;&s;ity, is unalterable peace of mind, fixed on too firm a ba&s;is to be &s;haken by adver&s;ity. Pain, poverty, ingratitude, calumny, and even the lo&s;s of tho&s;e we hold mo&s;t dear, may each tran&s;iently affect, but, united, cannot mortally wound it. Upon this principle, you will find it po&s;&s;ible not only to be content, but cheerful, under all the di&s;agreeable cir|cum&s;tances this &s;tate of probation is liable to; and, by making a proper u&s;e of them, you may effectually remove the garb of terror from the la&s;t of all tempo|ral evils. Learn, then, with grateful plea&s;ure to meet approaching death as the kind remover of every pain|ful &s;en&s;ation, the friendly guide to perfect and to everla&s;ting happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Believe me, this is not mere theory. My own ex|perience every moment proves the fact undeniably true. My conduct, in all tho&s;e relations which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t with me, nearly as human imperfection will allow, is governed by the rules here laid down for you; and it produces the con&s;tant rational compo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, which con&s;titutes the mo&s;t perfect felicity of human life: for with truth I can aver, that I daily feel in|comparably more real &s;atisfaction, more true content|ment in my pre&s;ent retirement, than the gaye&s;t &s;cenes of fe&s;tive mirth ever afforded me. I am plea&s;ed with this life, without an anxious thought for the continu|ance of it; and am happy in the hope of hereafter exchanging it for a life infinitely better. My &s;oul, un&s;tained by the crimes unju&s;tly imputed to me, mo&s;t &s;incerely forgives the malicious authors of the&s;e im|putations: it anticipates the future plea&s;ure of an open
<PB N="172" REF="024452_0169_0FC73E86DDE64C00">
acquittal, and, in that expectation, lo&s;es the pain of pre&s;ent and unde&s;erved cen&s;ure. By this is meant the in&s;tance that was made the &s;uppo&s;ed foundation for the la&s;t of innumerable injuries which I have received, through him, from whom I am con&s;cious of having de&s;erved the kinde&s;t treatment. Other faults, no doubt, I might have many; to him I had very few: nay, for &s;everal years, I cannot, upon reflexion, accu&s;e my&s;elf of any thing but of a too ab&s;olute, too unre&s;erved obedience to every injunction, even where plainly contrary to the dictates of my own rea&s;on. How wrong &s;uch a compliance was, has been clearly proved by many in&s;tances, in which it has been &s;ince mo&s;t ungenerou&s;ly and mo&s;t ungratefully urged as a circum&s;tantial argument again&s;t me.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, indeed, be owned, that for the two or three la&s;t years, tired with a long &s;eries of repeated in&s;ults, of a nature almo&s;t beyond the power of ima|gination to conceive, my temper became &s;oured: a con&s;tant, fruitle&s;s endeavour to oblige was changed into an ab&s;olute indifference about it; and ill humour occa&s;ioned by frequent di&s;appointment&mdash;a con&s;e|quence I have experimentally warned you again&s;t&mdash; was perhaps &s;ometimes too much indulged. How far the unequalled provocations may be allowed as an excu&s;e for this, heaven only mu&s;t determine, who&s;e goodne&s;s has thought fit to relea&s;e me from the pain|ful &s;ituation; though by a method, at pre&s;ent, not the mo&s;t eligible, as it is the cau&s;e of a &s;eparation <HI>from my children al&s;o,</HI> and thereby has put it out of my power to attend, in the manner I could have wi&s;hed, to their education; a duty that inclination would have led me with equal care and plea&s;ure more amply to fulfil, had they continued under my direction. But as Providence has thought fit other|wi&s;e to determine, contented I &s;ubmit to every di&s;|pen&s;ation, convinced that all things are ordered for the be&s;t, and that they will, in the end, work together for good to them that fear God, and who &s;incerely endeavour to keep his commandments. If in the&s;e
<PB N="173" REF="024452_0170_0FC73E8979DF52A8">
I err, I am certain it is owing to a mi&s;take in the judgment, not to a defect of the will.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavoured, my dear girl, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to compen&s;ate both to you and to your &s;i&s;ters the deprivation of a con&s;tant maternal care, by ad|vi&s;ing you according to my be&s;t ability, in the mo&s;t material parts of your conduct through life, as parti|cularly as the compa&s;s of a letter would allow me.

<P>THE world has, in all ages, been very negligent in the education of daughters; all their care is laid out entirely upon the men; and, as if the wo|men were a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, they leave them to them|&s;elves without any helps, without thinking that they compo&s;e one half of the world; that the two &s;exes are nece&s;&s;arily united together by alliances; that the women make either the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of the men, who always feel the want of having them rea|&s;onable; that they are a great means of the ri&s;e and ruin of families; that they are entru&s;ted with the e|ducation of the children in their early youth, a &s;ea|&s;on of life in which they receive the livelie&s;t and deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. What would they have them in|&s;pire into their children, when, from their very in|fancy, they are left them&s;elves in the hands of go|vernantes, who, as they are generally taken out of the low world, in&s;pire them with low &s;entiments, encou|rage all the timorous pa&s;&s;ions, and form them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;u|per&s;tition in&s;tead of religion. 'Twould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a &s;ubject worthier of their thoughts to contrive how to make certain virtues hereditary to their families, by con|veying

them down from the mother to the children, than how to &s;ecure their e&s;tates by entails. No|thing, therefore, is &s;o much mi&s;taken as the educati|on which they give to young women: they de&s;ign them to plea&s;e; they give them no in&s;tructions but for the ornament and graces of the body; they flatter their &s;elf-love; they give them up to effeminacy, to the world and to fal&s;e opinions; they give them no lectures of virtue and fortitude: &s;urely it is un|rea&s;onable or rather downright madne&s;s to imagine that &s;uch an education &s;hould not turn to their pre|judice.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary, my daughter, to ob&s;erve all the outward rules of <HI>decorum;</HI> but this is not enough to gain you the e&s;teem of the world; 'tis the &s;enti|ments of the mind that form the character of a per|&s;on; that lead the under&s;tanding; that govern the will; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at &s;ecure the reality and duration of all our virtues: but religion &s;hould be the principle and foundation of the&s;e &s;entiments. When religion is once engraven on our heart, all the virtues will na|turally flow from that &s;ource; all the duties of life will be regularly practi&s;ed in their re&s;pective order. 'Tis not enough for the conduct of young per&s;ons, to oblige them to do their duty; they mu&s;t be brought to love it. Authority is a tyrant only over the out|ward behaviour; it has no &s;way over the inward &s;en|timents. When one pre&s;cribes a conduct, we &s;hould repre&s;ent the rea&s;ons and the motives of it, and give them a reli&s;h for what we advi&s;e them.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;o much for our intere&s;t to practi&s;e virtue, that we &s;hould never con&s;ider it as our enemy, but rather as the &s;ource of happine&s;s, of glory, and of peace.</P>
<P>You are ju&s;t coming into the world: enter it, my daughter, with &s;ome principles: you cannot fortify your&s;elf too much again&s;t what you will meet with there: bring along with you all your religion: nou|ri&s;h it in your heart by your &s;entiments; confirm it in your mind by proper reflexions, and by reading adapted to encourage it.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="024452_0173_0FC73E9326677F48">There is nothing more nece&s;&s;ary, and indeed more happy for us than to keep up a &s;entiment that makes us love and hope; that gives us a pro&s;pect of an a|greeable futurity; that reconciles all times; that in|&s;ures all the duties of life; that an&s;wers for us to our&s;elves, and is our guarantee with regard to others. What a &s;upport will you find from religion under the misfortunes that threaten you! for a certain number of misfortunes mu&s;t fall to your &s;hare. 'Twas a &s;ay|ing of one of the ancients,
<Q>That he wrapped him|&s;elf up in the mantle of his virtue:</Q>
Wrap your&s;elf up in that of your religion; it will be a great help to you again&s;t the weakne&s;s of youth, and a &s;ure refuge in your riper years.</P>
<P>Women, who have cultivated their under&s;tanding with nothing but the maxims of the world, are pre|&s;ented at la&s;t with an univer&s;al blank, and find them|&s;elves in a terrible want of thought and employment, the mo&s;t irk&s;ome &s;ituation in life. As they advance in age, the world quits them, and rea&s;on tells them they &s;hould quit the world; but where mu&s;t they go for relief? The time pa&s;t furni&s;hes us with regrets, the pre&s;ent with inquietudes, and the time to come with fears. Religion alone calms all our unea&s;ine&s;s, and comforts us under all misfortunes: by uniting you to God, it reconciles you with the world, and your&s;elf too.</P>
<P>A young per&s;on, when &s;he comes into the world, frames to her&s;elf an high notion of the happine&s;s re|&s;erved for her. She &s;ets her&s;elf to obtain it; 'tis the &s;ource of all her cares. She is always on the hunt after her notion, and in hopes of finding a perfect happine&s;s: this is the occa&s;ion of lightne&s;s and incon|&s;tancy.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ures of the world are deceitful; they promi&s;e more than they perform; the que&s;t of them is full of anxiety: their enjoyment is far from yield|ing any true &s;atisfaction, and their lo&s;s is attended with vexation.</P>
<P>To fix your de&s;ires, think that no &s;olid or la&s;ting happine&s;s is to be found any where but in your own
<PB N="178" REF="024452_0174_0FC73E9477BAA1D0">
brea&s;t. Honours and riches have no charms that are la&s;ting for any length of time: their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion extends our view, and gives us new de&s;ires. Plea&s;ures, when they grow familiar, lo&s;e their reli&s;h. Before you have ta&s;ted them, you may do without them; where|as enjoyment makes that nece&s;&s;ary to you, which was once &s;uperfluous, and you are wor&s;e at your ea&s;e than you were before. By enjoying them you grow u&s;ed to them, and when you lo&s;e them, they leave you nothing but emptine&s;s and want. What affects us &s;en&s;ibly is the pa&s;&s;age from one circum&s;tance of life to another; the interval between a mi&s;erable &s;ea&s;on and a happy one. The &s;en&s;e of plea&s;ure wears off as &s;oon as we grow habituated to it. 'Twould be a great advantage, if rea&s;on could at once lay before us all that is nece&s;&s;ary for our happine&s;s. Experience brings us back to our&s;elves; &s;pare your&s;elf that ex|pen&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d lay it early down for a maxim, with a firmne&s;s and re&s;olution to determine your conduct, that
<Q>true felicity con&s;i&s;ts in peace of mind, in rea|&s;on, and in the di&s;charge of our duty.</Q>
Let us not fancy our&s;elves happy, my daughter, till we feel our plea&s;ures of this &s;ort flow from the bottom of our &s;oul.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflexions &s;eem too &s;trong for a young per|&s;on, and are proper for a riper age: however, I be|lieve you are capable of them; and be&s;ides, I am in|&s;tructing my&s;elf. We cannot engrave the precepts of wi&s;dom too deeply in our hearts; the impre&s;&s;ions that they make are always too light; but it can't be denied that &s;uch as u&s;e them&s;elves to make reflexions, and fortify their hearts with principles, are in a fairer way to virtue than &s;uch as neglect them. If we are unhappy enough to be defective in the practice of our duty, let us at lea&s;t not be wanting in our affection to it: let us then, my daughter, make u&s;e of the&s;e precepts for a continual help to our virtue.</P>
<P>'Tis commonly &s;aid, there are two prejudices with which every body mu&s;t comply: religion and honour. 'Tis a wrong expre&s;&s;ion to call religion a prejudice. A prejudice is an opinion that may be &s;ub&s;ervient to
<PB N="179" REF="024452_0175_0FC73E98F5BA5560">
error as well as truth; the term ought never to be applied but to things that are uncertain; and religi|on is not &s;o.</P>
<P>Honour is, indeed, an invention merely human; yet nothing is more real than the evils that people &s;uffer who would get rid of it; 'twould be dangerous to &s;hake it off; we &s;hould rather do all we can to fortify a &s;entiment that ought to be a rule to our conduct, &s;ince nothing is more de&s;tructive of our quiet, or makes our life more unequal, than to think one way and act another. Po&s;&s;e&s;s your heart as much as is po&s;&s;ible with &s;entiments for the conduct that you ought to ob&s;erve; fortify this prejudice of honour in your mind; you cannot be too &s;crupulou&s;ly nice on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Never warp in the lea&s;t from the&s;e principles; never entertain a notion, as if the virtue of women was a virtue only enjoined by cu&s;tom; nor allow your&s;elf to think you have &s;ufficiently di&s;charged your obligations if you can but e&s;cape the eyes of the world. There are two courts before which you mu&s;t inevitably appear in judgment, your con&s;cience and the world; you may po&s;&s;ibly get clear of the world, but you can never get clear of con&s;cience. Secure her te&s;timony in favour of your hone&s;ty; 'tis what you owe to your&s;elf; but withal do not neglect the approbation of the public; for a contempt of reputa|tion naturally leads to a contempt of virtue.</P>
<P>When you are a little acquainted with the world, you will find that there is no need of the &s;anctions and terror of laws to keep you within the bounds of your duty: the example of &s;uch as have deviated from it, and the calamities that have ever attended them, is enough to &s;top any inclination in the mid&s;t of its career; for there is no coquet but mu&s;t own, if &s;he would be &s;incere, that it is the greate&s;t misfortune in the world to be forgotten and neglected.</P>
<P>Shame is a pa&s;&s;ion that might be of excellent ad|vantage to us, if we managed it well: I do not mean that fal&s;e &s;hame which only &s;erves to di&s;turb our quiet, without being of any &s;ervice to our behaviour;
<PB N="180" REF="024452_0176_0FC73E9D14C419E0">
I &s;peak of that which keeps us from evil, out of fear of di&s;honour: we mu&s;t confe&s;s, this &s;hame is &s;ome|times the &s;ure&s;t guard of the women's virtue; there are very few virtuous for virtue it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome great virtues, which, when they are carried to a certain degree, make a great many defects be overlooked; &s;uch as extraordinary valour in the men, and extreme mode&s;ty in the women. Agrippina, the wife of Germanicus, was excu&s;ed of all her faults on account of her cha&s;tity. This prince&s;s was ambitious and haughty; but, &s;ays Taci|tus,
<Q>all her pa&s;&s;ions were con&s;ecrated by her cha&s;|tity.</Q></P>
<P>If you are &s;en&s;ible and nice in the point of repu|tation, if you are apprehen&s;ive of being attacked as to e&s;&s;ential virtues, there is one &s;ure mean to calm your fears, and &s;atisfy your nicety; 'tis to be virtuous. Be &s;ure always to keep well with your&s;elf; 'tis a &s;ure income of plea&s;ures; and will gain you prai&s;e, and a good reputation be&s;ides; in a word, be but truly virtuous, and you'll find admirers enough.</P>
<P>The virtues that make a figure in the world do not fall to the women's &s;hare; their virtues are of a &s;imple and peaceable nature: fame will have nothing to do with us. 'Twas a &s;aying of one of the an|cients, that "the great virtues are for the men!" he allows the women nothing but the &s;ingle merit of being unknown; and
<Q>&s;uch as are mo&s;t prai&s;ed, (&s;ays he) are not always the per&s;ons that de&s;erve it be&s;t; but rather &s;uch as are not talked of at all.</Q>
The notion &s;eems to me to be wrong; but to reduce this maxim into practice, I think it be&s;t to avoid the world and making a figure, which always &s;trikes at mode&s;ty, and be contented with being one's own &s;pectator.</P>
<P>The virtues of the women are difficult, becau&s;e they have no help from glory to practi&s;e them. To live at home&mdash;to meddle with nothing but one's &s;elf and family&mdash;to be &s;imple, ju&s;t, and mode&s;t&mdash;are pain|ful virtues, becau&s;e they are ob&s;cure. One mu&s;t have a great deal of merit, to &s;hun making a figure, and a
<PB N="181" REF="024452_0177_0FC73E9E63D58DB0">
great deal of courage to bring one's &s;elf to be virtuous only to one's own eyes. Grandeur and reputation &s;erve for &s;upports to our weakne&s;s, for &s;uch, in reali|ty, is our de&s;ire to di&s;tingui&s;h and rai&s;e our&s;elves. The mind re&s;ts in the public approbation: but true glory con&s;i&s;ts in being &s;atisfied without it. Let it not enter, then, into the motives of your actions: 'tis enough that it is the recompence of them.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured, my daughter, that perfection and hap|pine&s;s cling together; that you can never be happy but by virtue, and &s;carcely ever unhappy but by ill conduct. Who&s;oever examine them&s;elves &s;trictly, will find that they never had any grievous affliction, but they occa&s;ioned it them&s;elves by &s;ome fault, or by being wanting in &s;ome duty. Anxiety always follows the lo&s;s of innocence: but virtue is ever attended with an inward &s;atisfaction, that is a con&s;tant &s;pring of felicity to all its votaries.</P>
<P>Do not, however, imagine that your only virtue is mode&s;ty; there are abundance of women that have no notion of any other, and fancy, that by practi&s;ing it they di&s;charge all the duties of &s;ociety: they think they have a right to neglect all the re&s;t, and to be as proud and cen&s;orious as they plea&s;e. Anne of Bretagne, a proud and imperious prince&s;s, made Lewis XII. &s;uffer exceedingly; and the good prince was u&s;ed to &s;ay when he &s;ubmitted to her humour, "we mu&s;t pay dear for the women's cha&s;tity." Make nobody pay for yours; think rather that it is a virtue which regards only your&s;elf, and lo&s;es its greate&s;t lu&s;tre, if it be not attended with the other virtues.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be very tender in our mode&s;ty; in|ward corruption pa&s;&s;es from the heart to the mouth, and occa&s;ions loo&s;e di&s;cour&s;e. The mo&s;t violent pa&s;|&s;ions have need of mode&s;ty to &s;how them&s;elves in a &s;educing form: it &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf in all your actions; it &s;hould &s;et off and embelli&s;h all your per|&s;on.</P>
<P>They &s;ay, that when Jove formed the pa&s;&s;ions, he a&s;&s;igned every one of them its di&s;tinct abode. Mo|de&s;ty
<PB N="182" REF="024452_0178_0FC73EA23A6DE6A8">
was forgotten; and when &s;he was introduced to him, he could not tell where to place her; &s;he was therefore allowed to con&s;ort with all the re&s;t. Ever &s;ince that time, &s;he is in&s;eparable from them&punc; &s;he is the friend of truth, and betrays the lie that d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res at|tack it; &s;he is in a &s;trict and intimate union with love: &s;he always attends, and frequently di&s;covers and proclaims it: love, in a word, lo&s;es his charms, whenever he appears without her: there is not a more glorious ornament for a young lady than mo|de&s;ty.</P>
<P>Let the chief part of your finery then be mode&s;ty: it has great advantages; it &s;ets off beauty, and &s;erves for a veil to ugline&s;s: mode&s;ty is the &s;upplement of beauty. The great misfortune of ugline&s;s, is, that it &s;mothers and buries the merit of women. People do not go to look in a forbidding figure for the engaging qualities of the mind and heart; 'tis a very difficult affair, when merit mu&s;t make its way, and &s;hine through a di&s;agreeable out&s;ide.</P>
<P>You do not want graces to make you agreeable; but you are no beauty: this obliges you to lay up a &s;tock of merit: the world will compliment you with nothing. Beauty has great advantages. One of the ancients &s;aid of it, that it was
<Q>a &s;hort tyranny, and the greate&s;t privilege in nature; that hand&s;ome per&s;ons carry letters of recommendation in their looks.</Q></P>
<P>Beauty in&s;pires a plea&s;ing &s;entiment, which prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es people in its favour. If you have made no &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, you mu&s;t expect to be taken to pieces. Take care that there be nothing in your air or man|ners to make any body think that you do not know your&s;elf: an air of confidence, in an ordinary figure, is &s;hocking enough. Let nothing in your di&s;cour&s;e or dre&s;s look like art; at lea&s;t, let it not be ea&s;y to find it out; the mo&s;t refined art never lets it&s;elf be &s;een.</P>
<P>You are not to neglect the accompli&s;hments and ornaments proper to make you agreeable; for women are de&s;igned to plea&s;e; but you &s;hould rather think
<PB N="183" REF="024452_0179_0FC73EA71BC33550">
of acquiring a &s;olid merit, than of employing your|&s;elf in trifling things. Nothing is &s;horter than the reign of beauty&punc; nothing is more melancholy than the latter part of the lives of women, who never knew any thing but that they were hand&s;ome. If any body makes their court to you for the &s;ake of your agreeable accompli&s;hments, make their regards centre in friend&s;hip, and &s;ecure the continuance of that friend&s;hip by your merits.</P>
<P>'Tis a difficult matter to lay down any &s;ure rules to plea&s;e. The graces, without merit, cannot plea&s;e long: and merit, without the graces, may command the e&s;teem of men, but can never move them. Wo|men, therefore, mu&s;t have an amiable merit, and join the graces to the virtues. I do not confine the merit of women merely to mode&s;ty; I give it a much larg|er extent. A valuable woman exerts the manly vir|tues of friend&s;hip, probity, and honour, in the punc|tual di&s;charge of all her obligations. An amiable wo|man &s;hould not only have the exterior graces but all the graces of the heart and fine &s;entiments of the mind. There is nothing &s;o hard as to plea&s;e, without being &s;o intent upon it, that it &s;hall look a little like coquetry. Women generally plea&s;e the men of the world more by their faults than their good qualities. The men are for making their advantages of the weakne&s;&s;es of amiable women: they would have nothing to do with their virtues; they do not care to e&s;teem them; they had much rather be amu&s;ed by per&s;ons of little or no merit, than be forced to admire &s;uch as are virtuous.</P>
<P>One mu&s;t know human nature, if one de&s;igns to plea&s;e. The men are much more affected with what is new, than with what is excellent: but the flower of novelty &s;oon fades; what plea&s;ed when it was new, &s;oon di&s;plea&s;es when it grows common. To keep up this ta&s;te of novelty, we mu&s;t have a great many re&s;ources and various kinds of merit within our&s;elves; we mu&s;t not &s;tick only at the agreeable ccompli&s;h|ments: we mu&s;t &s;trike their fancy with a variety of graces and merits, to keep up their inclinations, and
<PB N="184" REF="024452_0180_0FC73EA97A8FC688">
make the &s;ame object afford them all the plea&s;ures of incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P>Women are born with a violent de&s;ire to plea&s;e. As they find them&s;elves barred from all the ways that lead to glory and authority, they take another road to arrive at them, and make them&s;elves amends by their agreeablene&s;s. Beauty impo&s;es on the per&s;on that has it, and infatuates the &s;oul; yet remember, that there is but a very &s;mall number of years differ|ence between a fine woman and one that is no longer &s;o. Get over this exce&s;&s;ive de&s;ire to plea&s;e; at lea&s;t keep from &s;howing it. We mu&s;t not be extravagant in our dre&s;s, or let it take up all our time; the real graces do not depend on a &s;tudied finery: we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the mode as a trouble&s;ome &s;ort of &s;lavery, but comply with it no more than we are obliged in decency. The mode would be rea&s;onable, if it could be fixed to a point of perfection, convenience, and gracefulne&s;s; but to be always changing, is incon|&s;tancy, rather than politene&s;s and a good ta&s;te.</P>
<P>A good ta&s;te avoids all exce&s;&s;ive nicene&s;s; it treats little things as little ones, and gives it&s;elf very little trouble about them. Neatne&s;s is, indeed, agreeable, and de&s;erves to be ranked among things that are grace|ful; but it commences littlene&s;s, when it is carried to an exce&s;s: it is a much better temper to be carele&s;s in things of little con&s;equence, than to be too nice about them.</P>
<P>Young per&s;ons are very &s;ubject to the &s;pleen; as they are quite de&s;titute of knowledge, they run with eagerne&s;s towards &s;en&s;ible objects; their &s;pleen, how|ever, is the lea&s;t evil they have to dread: exce&s;&s;ive joys are no part of the train of virtue. All violent and moving plea&s;ures are dangerous. Though one is di&s;creet enough not to break through the rules of decency, and to keep within the bounds of mode&s;ty; yet when the heart is once moved with the plea&s;ure it feels, a &s;ort of &s;oftne&s;s diffu&s;es it&s;elf over the &s;oul, and takes away its reli&s;h for every thing that is called virtue; it &s;tops and makes you cool in the practice of your duty. A young per&s;on does not &s;ee the con|&s;equences
<PB N="185" REF="024452_0181_0FC73EAAF9754250">
of this flattering poi&s;on, the lea&s;t mi&s;chief of which is to di&s;turb the quiet of life, to deprave the ta&s;te, and render all &s;imple plea&s;ure in&s;ipid. When one &s;ees a young per&s;on happy enough not to have had her heart touched (as there is a natural di&s;|po&s;ition in us to a union, and this di&s;po&s;ition has not been exerci&s;ed), &s;he ea&s;ily complies, and gives her|&s;elf naturally to the per&s;on de&s;igned for her.</P>
<P>Be very cautious on the article of plays, and the like public diver&s;ions. There is no dignity in &s;howing one's &s;elf continually, nor is it an ea&s;y matter to pre&s;erve a &s;trict mode&s;ty in a con&s;tant hurry of diver|&s;ions. It is mi&s;taking one's intere&s;t to frequent them: If you have beauty, you mu&s;t not wear out the ta&s;te of the world by &s;howing your&s;elf continu|ally: you mu&s;t be &s;till more re&s;erved if you want graces to &s;et you off; be&s;ides, the con&s;tant u&s;e of di|ver&s;ions le&s;&s;ens the reli&s;h of them.</P>
<P>When all your life has been &s;pent in plea&s;ures, and they come to leave you, either becau&s;e your ta&s;te for them is over, or becau&s;e your rea&s;on forbids you the enjoyment of them, your mind finds it&s;elf in a mo&s;t unea&s;y &s;ituation for want of employment. If you would, therefore, have your plea&s;ures and amu&s;e|ments la&s;t, u&s;e them only as diver&s;ions to relieve you after more &s;erious occupations. Entertain your|&s;elf with your own rea&s;on; keep up that corre&s;pond|ence, and the ab&s;ence of plea&s;ures will not leave you any time upon your hands, nor any hankering after them.</P>
<P>It behoves us, therefore, to hu&s;band our ta&s;tes; there is no reli&s;hing life without them: but innocence only can pre&s;erve them in their integrity; irregularity is &s;ure to deprave them.</P>
<P>When we have found a heart, we make an advan|tage of every thing, and turn it into a &s;ource of plea&s;ures. We come frequently to plea&s;ures with a &s;ick's man's palate: we fancy our&s;elves nice, when we are only &s;urfeited and out of ta&s;te. When we have not &s;poiled our mind and heart by &s;entiments that &s;educe the fancy, or by any flaming pa&s;&s;ion, it
<PB N="186" REF="024452_0182_0FC73EB15A58B870">
is ea&s;y to find delight; health and innocence are the true fountains of joy. But when we have had the misfortune to habituate our&s;elves to vehement plea|&s;ures, we become in&s;en&s;ible to moderate ones. We &s;poil our ta&s;te by diver&s;ions, and u&s;e our&s;elves &s;o much to violent plea&s;ures, that we cannot take up with &s;uch as are &s;imple and regular.</P>
<P>We &s;hould always dread &s;uch great emotions of the &s;oul as leave us flat and out of &s;orts. Young per&s;ons have the greater rea&s;on to fear them, in that they are le&s;s capable of re&s;i&s;ting what flatters their &s;en&s;e. "Temperance," &s;aid one of the ancients, "is the be&s;t caterer for luxury." With this tem|perance, which makes the health both of mind and body, one has always a plea&s;ing and an equal joy; one has no need of diver&s;ions and expen&s;e; reading, work, and conver&s;ation, afford a purer joy than all the train of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures. In a word, in|nocent delights are of mo&s;t advantage; they are al|ways ready at hand; they are beneficent, and are never purcha&s;ed at too dear a rate. Other plea&s;ures flatter, but they do mi&s;chief: they alter the con|&s;titution of the mind, and &s;poil it like that of the body.</P>
<P>Be regular in all your views and in all your ac|tions; it would be happy if our fortune was &s;uch as to make computation of our income unnece&s;&s;ary; but as yours is narrow, it obliges you to be regular. Be di&s;creet in the article of your expen&s;es; if you do not ob&s;erve a moderation in them, you will &s;oon &s;ee your affairs in di&s;order: as &s;oon as you lay a&s;ide economy, you can an&s;wer for nothing.</P>
<P>Pompous living is the high road to ruin; and the ruin of people's fortune is almo&s;t always followed with corruption of manners: but in order to be regu|lar, it is no way nece&s;&s;ary to be covetous. Remem|ber, that avarice is of little &s;ervice, and di&s;honours a per&s;on infinitely. All that one &s;hould aim at, in a regular management, is to avoid the &s;hame and in|ju&s;tice that always attend an irregular conduct. We mu&s;t retrench &s;uperfluous expen&s;es only to be in a bet|ter

condition to afford &s;uch as decency, friend&s;hip, and charity engage us to make.</P>
<P>It is good order, and not the looking into little matters, that turns to any great account. Pliny, when he &s;ent his friend back a bond for a con&s;ider|able &s;um which his father owed him, with a general acquittance, told him,
<Q>I have but a &s;mall e&s;tate, and am obliged to be at great expen&s;es; but my frugality &s;erves for a fund to &s;upply me wherewith to do the &s;ervice that I render to my friends.</Q>
Borrow from your fancies and diver&s;ions, that you may have &s;omething to gratify the &s;entiments of ge|nero&s;ity, which every per&s;on of a genteel &s;pirit ought to have.</P>
<P>Never mind the wants that vanity creates.
"We mu&s;t be"
they &s;ay, "like others;" this <HI>like</HI> goes a va&s;t way. Have a nobler emulation, and allow nobody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o have more honour, probity, and integrity than your&s;elf. Be always &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of virtue: poorne&s;s of &s;oul is wor&s;e than poverty of for|tune.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t you are young, form your reputation; rai&s;e your credit; put your affairs in order: you would have more trouble about it in another &s;ea&s;on of life. Charles the fifth u&s;ed to &s;ay, that
<Q>fortune loved young folks.</Q>
In the time of youth, all the world offer them&s;elves to you, and lend you a helping hand: young people govern without thinking of it. But in more advanced age, you have no helps from any quarter; you have no longer that bewitching charm which has an influence on every body: you have nothing for you but rea&s;on and truth, which do not ordinarily govern the world.</P>
<P>"You are going," &s;aid Montaigne to &s;ome young people,
<Q>towards reputation and credit; but I am returning back.</Q>
When you cea&s;e to be young, you have no acqui&s;ition left you to make, but in point of virtue. In all your undertakings and actions, al|ways aim at the highe&s;t perfection; form no project, and &s;et about nothing without &s;aying to your&s;elf, "Could not I do better?" By this means you will
<PB N="188" REF="024452_0184_0FC73EB662667520">
in&s;en&s;ibly contract a habit of ju&s;tice and virtue, which will make the practice thereof ea&s;ier to you. Do what Seneca advi&s;ed his friend Lucilius: "Choo&s;e," &s;aid he to him,
<Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mong great men &s;ome one that you think is mo&s;t to be admired: do nothing but in his pre&s;ence; give him an account of all your actions.</Q>
Happy the man that is e&s;|teemed enough to be pitched on for this purpo&s;e! This is the more ea&s;y, becau&s;e young folks have a natural di&s;po&s;ition to imitation. They run le&s;s hazard when they choo&s;e their patterns from antiquity, where we generally meet with none but great exam|ples. Among the moderns it may have its incon|veniences; the copies of them very rarely &s;ucceed. It has been &s;aid long ago, that every copy ought to tremble before its original; they never follow it but at a di&s;tance: and yet it takes away your natural character, which is generally the true&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;imple. You are apt to grow negligent as to your&s;elf, when you fix your&s;elf to a model; be&s;ides, a great part of our faults come from imitation. Learn then to reverence and &s;tand in awe of your&s;elf: let your &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s be your own cen&s;or.</P>
<P>U&s;e all your application to make your&s;elf happy in your &s;tation of life; improve all the means you have: you lo&s;e a thou&s;and advantages for want of it. It is our attention, and comparing of things, that makes us happy.</P>
<P>The more addre&s;s and capacity you have, the more will you make of your circum&s;tances, and the more will you extend your plea&s;ures. It is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that makes us happy; it is enjoyment; and enjoy|ment lies in attention.</P>
<P>If people knew how to enjoy them&s;elves in their condition, they would not be troubled either with ambition or envy, and would be ble&s;&s;ed with a per|fect tranquillity: but we do not live enough in the pre&s;ent moment; our de&s;ires and hopes are always pu&s;hing us on towards futurity.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of madmen in the world; the one always live upon futurity, and feed them&s;elves
<PB N="189" REF="024452_0185_0FC73EB8812AF340">
with nothing but hopes; and as they are not wi&s;e enough to calculate them rightly, they pa&s;s their lives in a continual mi&s;take. Rea&s;onable per&s;ons are never taken up with any de&s;ires, but &s;uch as are within their reach: they often gain their point, and though they &s;hould be mi&s;taken, they would ea&s;ily con&s;ole them|&s;elves under the di&s;appointment; they know likewife that our fondne&s;s for things wears off upon the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, or cea&s;es upon &s;eeing the impo&s;&s;ibility of obtaining what we de&s;ire: wi&s;e men always make them&s;elves ea&s;y with &s;uch reflexions. There is ano|ther &s;ort of madmen, that make too much of the pre&s;ent, and take no manner of care for futurity; they ruin their fortune, their reputation, and their ta&s;te of life, by not managing them di&s;creetly. Men of &s;en&s;e join the&s;e two times together; they enjoy the pre&s;ent, and yet do not neglect the future.</P>
<P>It is a duty, my daughter, to employ our time; but what u&s;e do we make of it? Few people know how to value it as it de&s;erves.
<Q>Account to your|&s;elf,</Q>
&s;ays one of the ancients,
<Q>for every mo|ment of your time; that after making a ju&s;t u&s;e of the pre&s;ent, you may have le&s;s occa&s;ion for the future.</Q>
Time flies with rapidity: learn to live, that is, to make a good u&s;e of your time; but life is &s;pent too often in vain hopes, in que&s;t of fortune, or in waiting for it. All mankind feel the vanity of their condition, always taken up without being ever &s;atisfied. Remember, that life does not con&s;i&s;t in the &s;pace of time that you live, but in the u&s;e you &s;hould make of it: con&s;ider, that you have a mind to cul|tivate and feed with truth&mdash;a heart to purify and re|gulate&mdash;and a religious wor&s;hip to pay to the Deity.</P>
<P>As the fir&s;t years of life are precious, remember, daughter, to make an advantageous u&s;e of them. While the mind ea&s;ily receives impre&s;&s;ions, embelli&s;h your memory with valuable things, and con&s;ider, that you are laying in a provi&s;ion for your whole life. The memory is formed and improved by exerci&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity is a &s;entiment that you &s;hould not &s;tifle: it wants only to be managed, and placed on a right
<PB N="190" REF="024452_0186_0FC73EB9F7DA4378">
object. Curio&s;ity is a knowledge begun, which makes you advance farther and quicker in the road of truth: it is a natural di&s;po&s;ition that meets in&s;truction half|way: it &s;hould not be &s;topped by lazine&s;s and love of ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is very u&s;eful for young per&s;ons to employ their time in &s;olid &s;ciences; the Greek and Roman hi&s;tory elevate the mind, and rai&s;e the courage by the great actions that we &s;ee there related. We ought not to be ignorant of the hi&s;tory of our own country. I &s;hould not even blame a little philo&s;ophy, e&s;pecially the new, if one has a capacity for it; it helps to give you a clear judgment, to di&s;tingui&s;h your ideas, and to teach you to think ju&s;tly. I would likewi&s;e have a little morality: by the bare reading of Cicero, Pli|ny, and others, one gets a ta&s;te for virtue: it makes an in&s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion on us, that is of great advan|tage to our morals. The inclination to vice is cor|rected by the example of &s;o many virtues, and you will rarely find an evil di&s;po&s;ition have any reli&s;h for this &s;ort of reading. We do not love to &s;ee what is always upbraiding and condemning us.</P>
<P>As for languages, though a woman ought to be &s;a|tisfied with &s;peaking that of her own country, I &s;hould not thwart the inclination one might have for Latin. It opens you a gate to all the &s;ciences: it lets you into conver&s;ation with the be&s;t part of the world in all ages. Women are ready enough to learn Italian: but I think it dangerous; it is the language of love: the Italian writers are not very correct; you &s;ee in all their works a jingle of words, and a loo&s;e imagination, incon&s;i&s;tent with a ju&s;t way of thinking.</P>
<P>Poetry may produce &s;ome inconveniencies: I &s;hould however be loth to forbid the reading of the fine tragedies of Corneille: but the be&s;t of them often give you lectures of virtue, and leave you an impre&s;|&s;ion of vice.</P>
<P>The reading of romances is &s;till more dangerous: I would not have them much u&s;ed; they inure the mind to fal&s;ehoods. Romances having no foundation of truth to &s;upport them, warm the imagination, im|pair

mode&s;ty, put the heart in di&s;order, and if a young per&s;on have but the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to tender|ne&s;s, they hurry on and fire her inclination.

<P>Moderate your fondne&s;s for extraordinary &s;ciences; they are dangerous, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> teach one nothing but a va&s;t deal of vanity: they depre&s;s the activity of the &s;oul. If you have a very warm and active ima|gination, and a curio&s;ity which nothing can &s;top, it is much better to employ the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions in the &s;ciences, than to run the hazard of their being turned to &s;erve your pa&s;&s;ions: but remember, that a young lady &s;hould have almo&s;t as nice a mode&s;ty in the arti|cle of &s;ciences, as &s;he has with regard to vice.</P>
<P>Guard your&s;elf therefore again&s;t the inclination of &s;etting up for a virtuo&s;o; do not amu&s;e your&s;elf in running after vain &s;ciences, and &s;uch as are above your reach. Our &s;oul is much better qualified for enjoyment than it is for knowledge; we have all the knowledge that is proper and nece&s;&s;ary for our well being; but we will not &s;tick there; we are &s;till run|ning after truths that were not de&s;igned for us.</P>
<P>Before we engage in enquiries, that are above our capacities, we &s;hould know the ju&s;t extent of our under&s;tanding, and what rule we &s;hould have for de|terming our per&s;ua&s;ion: we &s;hould learn to di&s;tingui&s;h between opinion and knowledge, and &s;hould have re&s;olution enough to doubt, when we have no clear notion of things, as well as courage to be ignorant of what &s;urpa&s;&s;es us.</P>
<P>The better to prevent a vain opinion of our capa|city, and abate a confidence in our under&s;tanding, let us con&s;ider that the two principles of all our

knowledge, rea&s;on and the &s;en&s;es, want &s;incerity, and often deceive us. The &s;en&s;es impo&s;e on rea&s;on; and rea&s;on mi&s;leads them in its turn. The&s;e are our two guides, and both of them lead us out of the way. Such reflexions &s;hould naturally put us out of con|ceit with ab&s;tracted &s;ciences; it is much better for us to employ our time in u&s;eful points of knowledge.</P>
<P>Docility is a quality very nece&s;&s;ary for a young per&s;on, who &s;hould never have much confidence in her&s;elf: but this docility mu&s;t not be carried too far. In point of religion, indeed, it mu&s;t &s;ubmit to autho|rity; but on any other &s;ubject it mu&s;t receive nothing but from rea&s;on and evidence. By carrying docility too far, you do an injury to your rea&s;on; you make no u&s;e of your own judgment and under&s;tanding, which are impared for want of exerci&s;e. You &s;et too narrow bounds to your ideas, when you confine them to tho&s;e of other people. The te&s;timony of men only de&s;erves credit in proportion to the degree of certainty which they have acquired by examining into facts. There lies no pre&s;cription again&s;t truth: it is for all per&s;ons and all times. In a word, as a great man &s;ays,
<Q>To be a chri&s;tian, one mu&s;t be|lieve implicitly: but to be a wi&s;e man, one mu&s;t &s;ee clearly.</Q></P>
<P>Accu&s;tom your&s;elf to exerci&s;e your under&s;tanding, and make more u&s;e of it than of your memory. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll our heads with the notions of other people, and take no care to form any of our own. We fancy that we have made a great progre&s;s, when we load our memory with hi&s;tories and facts; but this is of very little &s;ervice to perfect our under&s;tanding. We mu&s;t u&s;e our&s;elves to thinking. The under&s;tanding extends and improves it&s;elf by exerci&s;e; yet few per&s;ons take care to exert i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Among our &s;ex the art of thinking is a &s;ort of dormant talent. Hi&s;torical facts, and the opinions of philo&s;ophers, will not defend you again&s;t a cala|mity that pre&s;&s;es you: you will not find your&s;elf much the &s;tronger for them. When an affliction comes upon you, you have recour&s;e to Seneca and Epicte|tus:
<PB N="193" REF="024452_0189_0FC73EC6ED7C4980">
Is it for their rea&s;on to give you con&s;olation? Is it not rather the bu&s;ine&s;s of your own? Make u&s;e of your own &s;tock; in the calm of life, make a proper provi&s;ion again&s;t the time of affliction, which you are &s;ure to meet with: you will find your&s;elf much better &s;upported by your own rea&s;on than by that of other people.</P>
<P>If you can govern your imagination, and make it &s;ubmit to rea&s;on and truth, it will be a great &s;tep towards your perfection and happine&s;s. Women are generally governed by their imagination; as they are not employed in any thing &s;olid, and are not in the cour&s;e of their lives troubled either with the care of their fortune, or the management of their affairs, they give them&s;elves up entirely to their plea&s;ures. Plays, dre&s;s, romances, and inclinations, all depend upon imagination. I know well enough, that if you keep it within due bounds, you take &s;o much off from your plea&s;ures; for imagination is the &s;ource of them; and the things that plea&s;e us mo&s;t, derive from her the charm and illu&s;ion in which all their agreeablene&s;s con&s;i&s;ts: but for one plea&s;ure of her creating, what evils doth &s;he not make us &s;uffer? She &s;tands continually between truth and us: Rea&s;on dares not &s;how her&s;elf, where imagination bears the &s;way. We &s;ee only as &s;he plea&s;es; and tho&s;e that are led by her, know what they &s;uffer from her by woful experience. It would be a very happy com|po&s;ition to make with her, to give her back all her plea&s;ures on condition that &s;he made you feel none of her pains: in a word, there is nothing &s;o incon|&s;i&s;tent with happine&s;s, as a fine, lively, and too heated imagination.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;s your&s;elf with a true notion of things, and take not up with the &s;entiments of the people: form your own judgment without giving into received opinions, and get over the prejudices of your infancy. When you feel your&s;elf under any unea&s;ine&s;s, take the following method: I have found the u&s;e of it: Examine into the occa&s;ion of your trouble; &s;trip it of all the di&s;gui&s;e that is about it, and of all the em|broidery
<PB N="194" REF="024452_0190_0FC73EC84152CE60">
of imagination, and you will find that it is generally nothing at all, or at lea&s;t great allowances are to be made. Value things only according to their real worth. We have a great deal more rea&s;on to complain of our fal&s;e notions than of our fortune; it is very frequently not &s;o much things that hurt us, as the opinion we have of them.</P>
<P>In order to be happy, we mu&s;t think rightly: we owe a great re&s;pect to the common opinions, when they concern religion; but we ought to think very differently from the vulgar in what regards morality and the happine&s;s of life. By the vulgar, I mean every body that has a low and vulgar way of think|ing; the court is filled with &s;uch &s;ort of creatures; and the world talks of nothing but fortune and credit; all the cry there is,
<Q>Go on, make ha&s;te forward;</Q>
whereas wi&s;dom &s;ays,
<Q>Take up with &s;imple things; choo&s;e an ob&s;cure but quiet life; get out of the hurry of the world; avoid a croud.</Q>
Fame is not all the recompen&s;e of virtue; the main part of it lies in the te&s;timony of your own con&s;ci|ence. A great virtue is &s;urely enough to comfort you for the lo&s;s of a little glory.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured, that the greate&s;t &s;cience is to know how to be independent. "I have learnt," &s;aid one of the ancients,

You mu&s;t provide your&s;elf &s;ome re&s;ources again&s;t the inquietudes of life, and &s;ome equivalent for the goods you had depended on. Secure your&s;elf a retreat and a place of refuge in your own brea&s;t; you can always return thither, and be &s;ure to find your&s;elf again. When the world is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to you, it will have le&s;s power over you: when you do not, by &s;ome &s;olid inclinations place your dependence on your&s;elf, you depend upon every thing el&s;e.</P>

It is there, indeed, where truth gives her in&s;tructions; where prejudices vani&s;h, where prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion wears off, and where opinion, that governs all, begins to lo&s;e its influence. When one con&s;iders the u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s and in&s;ignificancy of life, one is forced to &s;ay with Pliny,
<Q>It is much better to pa&s;s one's life in doing nothing at all, than in doing trifles of nothing.</Q></P>
<P>I have told you already, daughter, that happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in peace of mind: you cannot enjoy the plea&s;ures of the mind without health of mind: every thing almo&s;t is a plea&s;ure to a &s;ound mind. If you would live with tranquillity, the&s;e are the rules you are to ob&s;erve. The fir&s;t is, not to give your&s;elf up to things that plea&s;e; to u&s;e them only occa&s;ionally; not to expect too much from the men, for fear of being di&s;appointed; to be your own principal friend. Solitude too will in&s;ure you tranquillity, and is a friend to wi&s;dom: it is within you, that peace and truth take up their abode. Avoid the great world; there is no &s;ecurity in it; it always awakens &s;ome &s;entiment or other that we had almo&s;t cru&s;hed; there are but too many people in it that encourage loo&s;ene&s;s; the more one conver&s;es with it, the more authority do one's pa&s;&s;ions gain: it is hard to re&s;i&s;t the attack of vice, when it comes &s;o well attended: in a word, one comes back from it much weaker, le&s;s mode&s;t, and more unju&s;t, for having been among the men. The world ea&s;ily in&s;tils its poi&s;on into tender &s;ouls. We &s;hould likewi&s;e &s;hut up all the avenues to the pa&s;&s;ions; it is much ea&s;ier to keep them off, than van|qui&s;h them; and though one &s;hould be happy enough to bani&s;h them, yet from the time that they made their impre&s;&s;ion, they make us pay dear for their a|bode.

You will cea&s;e to fear, as &s;oon as ever you cea&s;e to de&s;ire. Depend upon it a wi&s;e man does not run after felicity, but makes his own happine&s;s: it mu&s;t be your own doing, and it is in your own power. Remember, that a very &s;mall mat|ter will &s;erve for all the real wants of life; but there mu&s;t be an infinite deal to &s;atisfy the imaginary wants of opinion; and that you will much &s;ooner reduce your de&s;ires to the level of your fortune, than rai&s;e your fortune to the level of your de&s;ires. If honours and riches could &s;atiate us, we might heap them up; but the thir&s;t of them increa&s;es by acquiring them: he that de&s;ires mo&s;t, is certainly the mo&s;t indigent.</P>

&s;entiment, but may prove dangerous, by oc|ca&s;ioning you often a great many di&s;appointments. The lea&s;t evil that happens from it is, that we often lo&s;e what we po&s;&s;e&s;s, by waiting for what we de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Our &s;elf-love makes us blind to our&s;elves, and di|mini&s;hes all our defects. We live with them as we do with the perfumes that we wear; we do not &s;mell them; they only incommode others: to &s;ee them in their right light we mu&s;t &s;ee them in other people. View your own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mperfections with the &s;ame eyes with which you view tho&s;e of others: be always exact in keeping to this rule: it will accu&s;tom you to equity. Examine your own nature, and make the be&s;t of your defects: there is none of them but may be tacked to &s;ome virtues, and be made to favour them. Morality does not propo&s;e to de&s;troy nature, but to perfect it. Are you vain-glorious? Make u&s;e of that &s;entiment to rai&s;e your&s;elf above the weakne&s;&s;es of your &s;ex, and to avoid the faults that aba&s;e it. Every unruly pa&s;&s;ion has a pain and &s;hame annexed to it, which &s;olicit you to quit it. Are you timorous? Turn that weakne&s;s into prudence; let it keep you from expo&s;|ing your&s;elf. Are you lavi&s;h? Do you love to give? It is ea&s;y to turn prodigality into genero&s;ity. Give with choice and judgment; but do not neglect indif|ferent people: lend when it is nece&s;&s;ary; but give to &s;uch as cannot return your kindne&s;s; by &s;o doing you &s;trike in with your inclination, and do good ac|tions: there is no weakne&s;s, but, if you plea&s;e, vir|tue can make a good u&s;e of it.</P>

people's. One has too great a di&s;po&s;ition to flatter one's &s;elf, and men are too near them&s;elves, to judge impartially in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e are general precepts for oppo&s;ing the vices of the mind: but your fir&s;t care &s;hould be to perfect your heart and your &s;entiments: it depends on your heart to make your virtue &s;ure and la&s;ting; it is pro|perly that which forms your character; and to make your&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of it, ob&s;erve this method. When you feel your&s;elf agitated with a &s;trong and violent pa&s;&s;ion, de&s;ire it to allow you a little time, and com|pound with your weakne&s;s. If, without hearing it a moment, you are for &s;acrificing every thing to your rea&s;on and your duty, there is room to fear that your pa&s;&s;ion may rebel, and grow &s;tronger than ever. You are under its command, and mu&s;t manage it with ad|dre&s;s: you will receive more help than you think, from &s;uch a conduct: you will find &s;ome &s;ure remedies even in your pa&s;&s;ion. If it be that of hatred, you will &s;ee that you have not altogether &s;o much rea&s;on to hate and revenge your&s;elf, as you at fir&s;t imagined. If, by misfortune, it be the contrary &s;entiment that has &s;eized you, there is no pa&s;&s;ion which furni&s;hes you &s;urer remedies again&s;t it&s;elf.</P>
<P>If your heart has the misfortune to be attacked by love, the&s;e are the remedies to &s;top its progre&s;s: think that its plea&s;ures are neither &s;olid nor con|&s;tant; they quit you; and if this was all the harm they would do you, 'tis enough. In pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;oul propo&s;es it&s;elf an object, and is more intimately unit|ed to it either by de&s;ire or enjoymemt, than it is to its own being; it places all its felicity in its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and all its mi&s;ery in the lo&s;s of the object. Yet this felicity of the imagination, this good of the &s;oul's choice, is neither &s;olid nor la&s;ting: it depends upon others; it depends upon your&s;elf; and you cannot an&s;wer either for others or for your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Love, in the beginning, offers you nothing but flowers, and hides all the danger from you; it im|po&s;es on you; it always takes &s;ome form which is not its own: the heart being in &s;ecret intelligence with
<PB N="199" REF="024452_0195_0FC73ED6DAD9C780">
it, conceals its inclination from you, for fear of alarming your rea&s;on and mode&s;ty. You fancy it a mere amu&s;ement; it is only the per&s;on's wit or good &s;en&s;e that plea&s;es us. In a word, love is almo&s;t al|ways unknown, till he has got the ma&s;tery. As &s;oon as he comes to be felt, fly that in&s;tant, and hearken not to the complaints of your heart. Love is not rooted out of the &s;oul with ordinary efforts; it has too many partizans within us: as &s;oon as it has &s;ur|pri&s;ed you, every thing is on its &s;ide again&s;t you, and nothing will &s;erve you again&s;t love. It is the mo&s;t cruel &s;ituation a rational per&s;on can be in&mdash; where there is nothing to &s;upport you&mdash;where you have no &s;pectator but your&s;elf. You mu&s;t &s;ummon up your courage immediately; and remember, that you mu&s;t make a much more &s;orrowful u&s;e of it, if you yield to your pa&s;&s;ion in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Reflect upon the fatal con&s;equences of pa&s;&s;ions, and you will find but too many examples to in&s;truct you: but we are often convinced of our mi&s;take, without being cured of our pa&s;&s;ion. Reckon up, if po&s;&s;ible, the evils that flow from love: it impo&s;es on the rea|&s;on; it fills the &s;oul and the &s;en&s;es with trouble; it takes away the flower of innocence; it &s;tuns virtue; it bla&s;ts the reputation, &s;hame being almo&s;t always the con&s;equence of love. Nothing deba&s;es you to &s;uch a degree, and &s;inks you &s;o much below your|&s;elf, as the pa&s;&s;ions. They degrade you: there is no|thing but rea&s;on that can maintain your dignity. It is far more unhappy to &s;tand in need of one's cou|rage to bear a misfortune, than to avoid it. The plea&s;ure of doing one's duty is a comfort to you; but never applaud your&s;elf, for fear of being hum|bled. Remember, that you carry your enemy about with you; adhere &s;trictly to a conduct that may an&s;wer for you to your&s;elf. Avoid plays and pa&s;&s;ionate re|pre&s;entations; you mu&s;t not &s;ee what you would not feel; mu&s;ic, poetry, all this is of the retinue of &s;en|&s;ual plea&s;ure. U&s;e your&s;elf to reading on &s;olid &s;ub|jects, to fortify your rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Do not conver&s;e with your imagination. It will
<PB N="200" REF="024452_0196_0FC739CA54056590">
paint love to you with all its charms. It is all &s;e|duction and illu&s;ion, when &s;he makes the repre&s;enta|tion: there is always a great drawback, when you quit her to come to the reality. St. Augu&s;tine has given us a de&s;cription of his condition, when he was inclined to quit love and plea&s;ures. He &s;ays, that what he loved, pre&s;ented it&s;elf to him under a charm|ing figure: he repre&s;ents what pa&s;&s;ed in his heart in &s;uch moving terms, that there is no reading it with|out danger. One mu&s;t pa&s;s &s;lightly over the pictures of plea&s;ure; &s;he is always to be feared, even at the very time we are taking mea&s;ures again&s;t her; and when we are fulle&s;t of the di&s;a&s;ters &s;he has occa&s;ion|ed, we are &s;till to mi&s;tru&s;t our&s;elves. The pa&s;&s;ion is apt to get ground by the examining of one's &s;elf; forgetfulne&s;s is the only &s;ecurity to be taken again&s;t love. You mu&s;t call your&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to account, and &s;ay,
<Q>What do I mean to do with the inclinati|on that is &s;eizing me? Are not &s;uch and &s;uch mi&s;|fortunes &s;ure to attend me, if I have the weakne&s;s to yield to it?</Q></P>
<P>Borrow forces and &s;uccour from your enemy and the very nature of love. If you would not flatter him, he will &s;upply you with them. Strip him of all the charms that your fancy gives him; lend him no|thing; give him no favour; and you will &s;ee he will have but little left.&mdash;After this, think no more of him; take a firm re&s;olution to fly from him; and depend-upon it, we are as &s;trong as we re&s;olve to be. Diver&s;ion and &s;imple amu&s;ements are nece&s;&s;ary; but we mu&s;t &s;hun all plea&s;ures that affect the heart.</P>
<P>It is not always our faults that ruin us, but the manner of our conduct, after we have committed them. An humble acknowledgment of our faults di&s;|arms re&s;entment, and &s;tops the violence of anger. Women that have had the misfortune to deviate from their duty, to break through decorum, to part with their virtue and mode&s;ty, owe &s;o much regard to cu&s;|tom, and ought to have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their breach of cha&s;tity, as to appear with a mortified air. It is a &s;ort of &s;atisfaction that the public expect from
<PB N="201" REF="024452_0197_0FC739CE620EE328">
them; they are &s;ure to remember your faults, when|ever you appear to forget them. Repentance in&s;ures a change of your conduct; prevent the malignity which is natural to mankind; put your&s;elf in the place that their pride allots you; they would have you humbled; and when you have made your&s;elf &s;o to their hands, they will have no more to &s;ay to you: but &s;he that is proud after committing faults, calls them to mind, and makes them immortal.</P>
<P>Let us now pa&s;s, my daughter, to the &s;ocial duties. I thought I was in the fir&s;t place to draw you out of the common education and the prejudices of child|hood, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary to fortify your rea|&s;on, and give you &s;ome &s;olid principles to &s;upport you. I thought mo&s;t of the di&s;orders of life were owing to fal&s;e opinions; that fal&s;e opinions produced loo&s;e &s;entiments; and that when the under&s;tanding is not enlightened, the heart is expo&s;ed to pa&s;&s;ions; that there mu&s;t be &s;ome truths fixed in the mind to pre|&s;erve us from error; and that one mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;entiments in the heart to keep out the pa&s;&s;ions. When you have once a knowledge of truth, and a love for ju&s;tice, there is no danger of all the other virtues.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t duty of civil life is to take care of others; &s;uch as live only for them&s;elves, fall into contempt, and are neglected by every body. If you require too much from others, they will refu&s;e you every thing, their friend&s;hip, their affections, and their &s;ervices. Civil life is a mutual intercour&s;e of good offices: the mo&s;t valuable part of mankind go &s;till further: by promoting the happine&s;s of others, you in&s;ure your own; 'tis the true&s;t politics to think in this manner.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more odious than people that make every body &s;ee that they live only for them&s;elves. An extravagant &s;elf-love is the &s;ource of great crimes; &s;ome degrees lower it occa&s;ions vices: but let there be ever &s;o little a &s;pice of it in a per&s;on, it impairs all the virtues and charms of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to make a friend&s;hip with per&s;ons who have a predominant &s;elf-love, and take care to &s;how it: and yet we can nver &s;trip our&s;elves of it en|tirely;
<PB N="202" REF="024452_0198_0FC739D1608C65C0">
as long as we are attached to life, we &s;hall be attached to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>But there is a qualified &s;elf-love that is not exer|ci&s;ed at the expen&s;e of others.</P>
<P>We fancy we exalt our&s;elves by depre&s;&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> equals: this makes us cen&s;orious and envious. Good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nature turns to more account than maligni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y. Do good when it is in your power; &s;peak well of all the world, and never judge with rigour. Such acts of goodne&s;s and genero&s;ity, frequently repeated, will gain you at lea&s;t a great and excellent reputation. All the world is engaged to commend you, to extenu|ate your defects, and enhance your good qualities. You &s;hould found your reputation upon your own vir|tues, and not upon the demerit of others: con&s;ider that their good qualities take nothing at all from you, and that the diminution of your reputation can be imputed to no body but your&s;elf.</P>
<P>One of the things that contributes mo&s;t to make us unhappy, is, that we depend too much upon the men; 'tis the &s;ource too of our inju&s;tice. We pick quar|rels with them, not on account of what they owe us, or of what they have promi&s;ed us, but on account of what we have hoped from them. We depend ab&s;o|lutely upon our hopes, which occa&s;ion us abundance of di&s;appointments.</P>
<P>Be not ra&s;h in your judgments and give no ear to calumnies: never give in to the fir&s;t appearance of things, nor be in ha&s;te to condemn any body. Re|member that there are things probable which are not true, as there are things true, which are not probable.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, in our private judgments, imitate the equity of &s;olemn judgments. Judges never decide without having examined, heard, and confronted the witne&s;&s;es with the parties concerned. But we, with|out any commi&s;&s;ion, &s;et up for umpires of reputation: and every proof is &s;ufficient, every authority appears good, when the bu&s;ine&s;s is to condemn. Prompted by our natural malignity, we fancy that we give our|&s;elves what we take away from others: hence ari&s;e
<PB N="203" REF="024452_0199_0FC739D28ADC0B68">
animo&s;ities and enmities; for every thing is &s;ure to be known.</P>
<P>Be equitable, therefore, in your judgments; the &s;ame ju&s;tice that you do to others, they will return to you. Would you have them think and &s;peak well of you, never &s;peak ill of any body.</P>
<P>Civility, which is an imitation of charity, is ano|ther of the &s;ocial virtues: it puts you above others, when you have it in a more eminent degree; but it is practi&s;ed and maintained at the expen&s;e of &s;elf-love. Civility is always borrowing &s;omething from your|&s;elf, and turning it to the advantage of others. 'Tis one of the great bonds of &s;ociety, and the only quality that makes one &s;afe and ea&s;y in the intercour&s;e of life.</P>
<P>We naturally love to govern; 'tis an unju&s;t incli|nation. Whence have we our right to pretend to exalt our&s;elves above others? There is but one ju&s;t and allowable &s;uperiority; 'tis that which virtue gives you; have more goodne&s;s and genero&s;ity than others: be beforehand with them, more in &s;ervices than bene|fits; 'tis the way to rai&s;e your&s;elf. A great di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s makes you as independent, and rai&s;es you higher than the ample&s;t fortune: nothing &s;inks us &s;o much, as a fondne&s;s for our own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The qualities of the heart have the greate&s;t concern in the commerce of life. The under&s;tanding does not endear us to others; and you frequently &s;ee men very odious with great parts; they are for giving you a good opinion of them&s;elves; they are for getting an a&s;cendant over and depre&s;&s;ing others.</P>
<P>Though humility has only been con&s;idered as a chri&s;tian virtue, it mu&s;t be owned to be a &s;ocial virtue; and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a one, that without it, 'tis a very tickli&s;h matter to have to do with you. 'Tis the conceit that you have of your&s;elf, which makes you maintain your rights with &s;o much arrogance, and in|trench on tho&s;e of other people.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t never be &s;trict in calling any body to ac|count. Exact civility does not in&s;i&s;t on all that is due to you. Do not be afraid of being before-hand
<PB N="204" REF="024452_0200_0FC739D643060858">
with your friends: if you have a mind to be a true friend, never in&s;i&s;t on any thing too &s;tiffly; but that your behaviour may not be incon&s;i&s;tent, as it expre&s;&s;es your inward di&s;po&s;ition, make often &s;erious reflexi|ons on your weakne&s;&s;es, and take your&s;elf to pieces. This examination will make you entertain &s;entiments of humility for your&s;elf, and of indulgence with re|gard to others.</P>
<P>Be humble without being ba&s;hful. Shame is a &s;e|cret pride; and pride is an error with regard to one's own worth, and an inju&s;tice with regard to what one has a mind to appear to others.</P>
<P>Reputation is an advantage very de&s;irable; but it is a weakne&s;s to court it with too much ardour, and do nothing but with a view to it. We ought to content our&s;elves with de&s;erving it. We &s;hould not di&s;cour|age &s;en&s;ibility for glory; 'tis the &s;ure&s;t help we have to virtue; but the bu&s;ine&s;s is to make choice of true glory.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tom your&s;elf to &s;ee what is above you without either admiration or envy; and what is below you without contempt. Do not let the pomp of greatne&s;s impo&s;e on you. None but little &s;ouls fall down and wor&s;hip grandeur. Admiration is only due to virtue.</P>
<P>To u&s;e your&s;elf to value men by their proper qua|lities, con&s;ider the condition of a per&s;on loaded with honours, dignities, and riches, who &s;eems to want nothing at all, but really wants every thing, by being de&s;titute of true goods, of tho&s;e internal qualities that are nece&s;&s;ary to the enjoyment and u&s;e of them. He &s;uffers as much as if his poverty was real, &s;o long as he has the &s;en&s;e of poverty, and is wi&s;hing for more. "There is nothing wor&s;e," &s;ays one of the ancients,
<Q>than poverty in the mid&s;t of riches, becau&s;e the evil lies in the mind.</Q>
The man that is in this &s;ituation, feels all the evils of opinion, without en|joying the goods of fortune. He is blinded by error, and tormented by his pa&s;&s;ions: while a rea&s;onable per&s;on, who has nothing at all, but &s;ub&s;titutes wi&s;e and &s;olid reflexions to &s;upply the place of riches and
<PB N="205" REF="024452_0201_0FC739D7C0A89C10">
honours, enjoys a tranquillity which nothing can equal. The happine&s;s of the one, and the mi&s;ery of the other, come only from their different manner of thinking.</P>
<P>If you find your&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;entment and re|venge, &s;trive to keep down that &s;entiment; there is nothing &s;o mean as to revenge one's &s;elf. If you meet with ill-treatment from any body, you owe them only contempt; 'tis a debt ea&s;y to be paid. If they have offended you only in &s;light matters, you owe them indulgence: but there are certain &s;ea&s;ons in life, when you mu&s;t meet with injuries&mdash;&s;ea&s;ons when the friends for whom you have done mo&s;t, fall foul upon and condemn you: in &s;uch a ca&s;e, after having done all you can, to undeceive them, do not be ob|&s;tinate in di&s;puting with them. One ought to court the e&s;teem of one's friends: but when you find peo|ple that will only view you through their prejudices&punc; when you have di&s;putes with &s;uch hot and fiery ima|ginations as will admit of nothing but what favours their inju&s;tice, you have nothing to do but retire and &s;et your heart at re&s;t. Do what you will, you'll get nothing from them but di&s;content. When you thus &s;uffer from their ill-u&s;age and &s;hame of recanting, comfort your&s;elf in your innocence, and the a&s;&s;urance that you have not offended. Think, that if your worth was not greater at the time they rai&s;ed you, it is not at all le&s;s now they are for cru&s;hing you: you &s;hould, without being more mortified at it, pity them, and not be exa&s;perated, if po&s;&s;ible, but &s;ay,
<Q>They &s;ee in a wrong light.</Q>
Con&s;ider that with good qua|lities one may at lea&s;t get over re&s;entment and envy. Let the hopes you draw from virtue, keep up your courage, and be your con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Do not think of revenging your&s;elf any way but by u&s;ing more moderation in your conduct, than tho&s;e that attack you, have malice. None but &s;ublime &s;ouls are touched with the glory of pardoning injuries.</P>
<P>Set your&s;elf to de&s;erve your own e&s;teem, the better to con&s;ole your&s;elf for the e&s;teem which others deny you. You can allow your&s;elf but one &s;ort of ven|geance;
<PB N="206" REF="024452_0202_0FC739DA0656AA58">
'tis that of doing good to &s;uch as have of|fended you: 'tis the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite revenge, and the only one that is allowable. You gratify your pa&s;&s;ion, and you intrench upon no virtue. Ce&s;ar has &s;et us an example of it. His lieutenant Labienus de&s;erted from him at a time that he &s;tood in mo&s;t need of him, and went over to Pompey, leaving great riches in Ce&s;ar's camp. Ce&s;ar &s;ent them after him, with a me&s;&s;age to tell him,
<Q>that was the manner of Ce&s;ar's re|venge.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis prudent to make a good u&s;e of other people's faults, even when they do us mi&s;chief; but very often they only begin the wrongs, and we fini&s;h them; they give us indeed a right again&s;t them&s;elves, but we make an ill u&s;e of it: we are for taking too much advan|tage of their faults. This is an inju&s;tice and a vio|lence that makes the &s;tanders-by again&s;t us. If we &s;uffered with moderation, all the world would be for us, and the faults of tho&s;e that attack us, would be doubled by our patience.</P>
<P>When you know that your friends have not treated you as they ought, take no notice of it. As &s;oon as ever you &s;how that you perceive it, their malignity increa&s;es, and you give a loo&s;e to their hatred: whereas by di&s;&s;embling it, you flatter their &s;elf-love; they enjoy the plea&s;ure of impo&s;ing on you; they fancy them&s;elves your &s;uperiors, as long as they are not di&s;covered; they triumph in your mi&s;take, and feel another plea&s;ure in not ruining you quite. By not letting them &s;ee that you know them, you give them time to repent and come to them&s;elves; and there needs nothing but a &s;ea&s;onable piece of &s;ervice, and a different manner of taking things, to make them more attached to you than ever.</P>
<P>Be inviolable in your word. But to gain it an en|tire confidence, remember that you mu&s;t be extremely &s;crupulous in keeping it. Show your regard to truth even in things indifferent; and con&s;ider that there is nothing &s;o de&s;picable as to deviate from it. 'Tis a common &s;aying, that lying &s;hows that people de&s;pi&s;e God, and &s;tand in fear of man; and that the man
<PB N="207" REF="024452_0203_0FC739E05D96A948">
who &s;peaks truth, and does good, re&s;embles the Diety. We &s;hould likewi&s;e avoid &s;wearing; the bare word of an hone&s;t per&s;on &s;hould have all the credit and authority of an oath.</P>
<P>Politene&s;s is a de&s;ire of plea&s;ing: nature gives it, education and the world improve it. Politene&s;s is a &s;upplement to virtue. They &s;ay it came into the world, when that daughter of heaven abandoned it. In ruder times, when virtue bore a greater &s;way, they knew le&s;s of politene&s;s: it came in with volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s; it is the daughter of luxury and delicacy. It has been di&s;puted, whether it approaches neare&s;t to vice or virtue. Without pretending to decide the que&s;tion, or define politene&s;s: may I be allowed to &s;peak my &s;entiments of it? I take it to be one of the greate&s;t bonds of &s;ociety, as it contributes mo&s;t to the peace of it; 'tis a preparation to charity, and an imi|tation, too, of humility. True politene&s;s is mode&s;t; and, as it aims to plea&s;e, it knows that the way to carry its point, is to &s;how that we do not prefer our&s;elves to others, but give them the fir&s;t rank in our e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Pride keeps us off from &s;ociety: our &s;elf-love gives us a peculiar rank, which is always di&s;puted with us. Such a high e&s;teem of our&s;elves, as makes others feel it, is almo&s;t always puni&s;hed with an univer&s;al con|tempt. Politene&s;s is the art of reconciling agreeably what we owe to others, and what one owes to one's &s;elf; for the&s;e duties have their bounds, which when they exceed, 'tis flattery with regard to others, and pride with regard to your&s;elf. It is the mo&s;t &s;educ|ing quality in nature.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t polite per&s;ons have generally a good deal of &s;weetne&s;s in their conver&s;ation, and engaging qualities: 'tis the girdle of Venus; it &s;ets off, and gives graces and charms to all that wear it; and with it, you cannot fail to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal degrees of politene&s;s. You carry it to a higher point in proportion to the delicacy of your way of thinking. It di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf in all your behaviour, in your conver&s;ation, and even in your &s;ilence.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="024452_0204_0FC739E26709E580">Perfect politene&s;s forbids us to di&s;play our parts and talents with a&s;&s;urance; it even borders upon cruelty, to &s;how one's &s;elf happy when we have cer|tain misfortunes before our eyes. Conver&s;ation in the world is enough to poli&s;h our outward behavi|our; but there mu&s;t be a good deal of delicacy to form a politene&s;s of mind. A nice politene&s;s, formed with art and ta&s;te, will make the world excu&s;e you a great many failings, and improve your good qua|lities. Such as are defective in point of behaviour, have the greater need of &s;olid qualities, and make &s;lower advances in gaining a reputation. In a word, politene&s;s co&s;ts but little, and is of va&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>Silence always becomes a young per&s;on. There is a mode&s;ty and dignity in keeping it; you &s;it in judg|ment upon others, and run no hazard your&s;elf. But guard your&s;elf again&s;t a proud and in&s;ulting &s;ilence; it &s;hould be the re&s;ult of your prudence, and not the con&s;equence of your pride. But as there is no hold|ing our peace always, it is fit for us to know, that the principal rule for &s;peaking well, is to think well.</P>
<P>When your notions are clear and di&s;tinct, your di&s;cour&s;e will be &s;o too; let a proper decorum and mode&s;ty run through it. In all your di&s;cour&s;es, pay a regard to received cu&s;toms and prejudices. Ex|pre&s;&s;ions declare the &s;entiments of the heart, and the &s;entiments form the behaviour.</P>
<P>Be particularly careful not to &s;et up for a joker; 'tis an ill part to act; and by making others laugh, we &s;eldom make our&s;elves e&s;teemed. Pay a great deal more attention to others, than to your&s;elf, and think how to &s;et them out, rather than to &s;hine your|&s;elf. We &s;hould learn how to li&s;ten to other people's di&s;cour&s;e, and not betray an ab&s;ence of mind either by our eyes or our manner. Never dwell upon &s;to|ries. If you chance to tell any, do it in a genteel and clo&s;e manner; let what you &s;ay be new, or at lea&s;t give it a new turn. The world is full of peo|ple, that are dinning things into your ears, without &s;aying any thing to entertain the mind. Whenever we &s;peak, we &s;hould take care either to plea&s;e or

<P>You may approve what you hear; but &s;hould very &s;eldom admire it: admiration is proper to blockheads. Never let your di&s;cour&s;e have an air of art and cun|ning; the greate&s;t prudence lies in &s;peaking little, and &s;howing more diffidence of one's &s;elf, than of other people. An upright conduct, and a reputation for probity, gains more confidence and e&s;teem, and, at the long-run, more advantages, too, in point of for|tune, than any by-ways. Nothing makes you &s;o wor|thy of the greate&s;t matters, and rai&s;es you &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bove others, as an exact probity.</P>
<P>U&s;e your&s;elf to treat your &s;ervants with kindne&s;s and humanity. 'Tis a &s;aying of one of the ancients, "that we ought to con&s;ider them as unhappy friends." Remember that the va&s;t difference between you and them, is owing merely to chance&mdash;never make them unea&s;y in their &s;tate of life, or add weight to the trouble of it. There is nothing &s;o poor and mean as to be haughty to any body that is in your &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Never u&s;e any har&s;h language. It &s;hould never come out of the mouth of a delicate and polite per|&s;on. Servitude being &s;ettled in oppo&s;ition to the na|tural equality of mankind, it behoves us to &s;often it. What right have we to expect our &s;ervants &s;hould be without faults, when we give them in&s;tances every day of our own? Let us rather bear with them. When you &s;how your&s;elf in all your humours and fits of pa&s;&s;ion (for we often lay our&s;elves open before our &s;ervants) how do you expo&s;e your&s;elf to them? (an you have any right afterwards to reprimand them? A mean familiarity with them is indeed ever to be avoided; but you owe them a&s;&s;i&s;tance, advice, and bounties &s;uitable to their condition and wants.</P>
<P>One &s;hould keep up authority in one's family; but it &s;hould be a mild authority. We &s;hould not indeed always threaten without puni&s;hing, for fear of bring|ing our threats into contempt: but we &s;hould not

call in authority, till per&s;ua&s;ion has failed. Re|member, that humanity and chri&s;tianity put all the world on the &s;ame foot. The impatience and heat of youth, joined to the fal&s;e notion they give you of your&s;elf, make you look upon your &s;ervants as crea|tures of a different &s;pecies; but how contrary are &s;uch &s;entiments to the mode&s;ty that you owe to your|&s;elf, and the humanity you owe to others!</P>
<P>Never reli&s;h or encourage the flattery of &s;ervants; and to prevent the impre&s;&s;ion which their fawning &s;peeches, frequently repeated, may make upon you, con&s;ider that they are hirelings paid to &s;erve your weakne&s;&s;es and pride.</P>
<P>If by misfortune, daughter, you &s;hould not think fit to follow my advice and precepts, though they be lo&s;t upon you, they will &s;till be u&s;eful to my&s;elf, as laying me under new obligations. The&s;e reflexions are fre&s;h engagements to me to exert my&s;elf in the way of virtue. I fortify my rea&s;on even again&s;t my|&s;elf; for I am now under a nece&s;&s;ity of following it, or el&s;e I expo&s;e my&s;elf to the &s;hame of having known it, and yet been fal&s;e to it.</P>
<P>There is nothing, my daughter, more mortifying than to write upon &s;ubjects that put me in mind of all my faults. By laying them open to you, I give up my right to reprimand you; I furni&s;h you with arms again&s;t my&s;elf. And I allow you freely to u&s;e them, if you &s;ee any vices in me incon&s;i&s;tent with the virtues that I recommend to you; for all advice and precepts want authority, when they are not &s;upport|ed by example.</P>

<HEAD>THE LADIES' LIBRARY. Letter on the Government of the Temper. To a young Lady.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mrs. Chapone.</BYLINE>
<P>A great Point of Importance to your future happi|ne&s;s, my dear, is what your parents have, doubt|le&s;s, been continually attentive to from your in|fancy, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to undertake it too early&mdash; I mean the due regulation of your temper. Though you are in a great mea&s;ure indebted to their forming hands for whatever is good in it, you are &s;en&s;i|ble, no doubt, as every human creature is, of pro|pen&s;ities to &s;ome infirmity of temper, which it mu&s;t now be <HI>your own</HI> care to correct and to &s;ubdue; other|wi&s;e the pains that have hitherto been taken with you, may all become fruitle&s;s: and, when you are your own mi&s;tre&s;s, you may relap&s;e into tho&s;e faults, which were originally in your nature, and which will require to be diligently watched and kept under, through the whole cour&s;e of your life.</P>
<P>If you con&s;ider, that the con&s;tant tenor of the go&s;|pel precepts is to promote love, peace, and good-will among men, you will not doubt that the cultivation of an amiable di&s;po&s;ition is a great part of your re|ligious duty; &s;ince nothing leads more directly to the breach of charity, and to the injury and mole&s;tation
<PB N="212" REF="024452_0208_0FC739EFF759A5B0">
of our fellow-creatures, than the indulgence of an ill temper. Do not, therefore, think lightly of the offences you may commit, for want of a due command over it, or &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for them to your fellow-creatures only; but be a&s;&s;ured, you mu&s;t give a &s;trict account of them all to the Supreme Go|vernor of the world, who has made this a great part of your appointed trial upon earth.</P>
<P>A woman, bred up in a religious manner, placed above the reach of want, and out of the way of &s;or|did and &s;candalous vices, can have but few tempta|tions to the flagrant breach of the divine laws. It particularly concerns her, therefore, to under&s;tand them in their full import, and to con&s;ider, how far &s;he tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t them, by &s;uch actions as appear trivial, when compared with murder, adultery, and theft, but which become of very great importance, by being frequently repeated, and occurring in the daily tran&s;actions of life.</P>
<P>The principal virtues or vices of a woman mu&s;t be of a private and dome&s;tic kind. Within the circle of her own family and dependants lies her &s;phere of action&mdash;the &s;cene of almo&s;t all tho&s;e ta&s;ks and trials, which mu&s;t determine her character, and her fate here, and hereafter. Reflect for a moment, how much the happine&s;s of her hu&s;band, children, and &s;ervants, mu&s;t depend on her temper; and you will &s;ee that the greate&s;t good, or evil, which &s;he ever may have in her power to do, may ri&s;e from her cor|recting or indulging its infirmities.</P>
<P>Though I wi&s;h the principle of duty towards God to be your ruling motive in the exerci&s;e of every virtue, yet, as human nature &s;tands in need of all po&s;&s;ible helps, let us not forget how e&s;&s;ential it is to pre&s;ent happine&s;s, and to the enjoyment of this life, to cultivate &s;uch a temper as is likewi&s;e indi&s;pen&s;a|bly requi&s;ite to the attainment of higher felicity in the life to come. The greate&s;t outward ble&s;&s;ings can|not afford enjoyment to a mind ruffled and unea&s;y within it&s;elf. A fit of ill-humour will &s;poil the fine&s;t entertainment, and is as real a torment as the
<PB N="213" REF="024452_0209_0FC739F3E37197D8">
mo&s;t painful di&s;ea&s;e. Another unavoidable con&s;e|quence of ill-temper is the di&s;like and aver&s;ion of all who are witne&s;&s;es to it, and, perhaps, the deep and la&s;ting re&s;entment of tho&s;e, who &s;uffer from its effects. We all, from &s;ocial or &s;elf-love, earne&s;tly de&s;ire the e&s;teem and affection of our fellow-creatures; and indeed our condition makes them &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to us, that the wretch, who has forfeited them, mu&s;t feel de&s;olate and undone, deprived of all the be&s;t enjoy|ments and comforts the world can afford, and given up to his inward mi&s;ery, unpitied and &s;corned. But this can never be the fate of a good-natured per&s;on: whatever faults he may have, they will generally be treated with lenity; he will find an advocate in eve|ry humane heart; his errors will be lamented ra|ther than abhorred; and his virtues will be viewed in the faire&s;t point of light: his good-humour, with|out the help of great talents or acquirements, will make his company preferable to that of the mo&s;t bril|liant genius, in whom this quality is wanting: in &s;hort, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that you can be &s;incere|ly beloved by any body, without this engaging pro|perty, whatever other excellencies you may po&s;&s;e&s;s: but, with it, you will &s;carcely fail of finding &s;ome friends and favourers, even though you &s;hould be de&s;titute of almo&s;t every other advantage.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will &s;ay,
<Q>all this is very true, but our tempers are not in our own power&mdash;we are made with different di&s;po&s;itions, and, if mine is not not amiable, it is rather my unhappine&s;s than my fault.</Q>
This, my dear, is commonly &s;aid by tho&s;e who will not take the trouble to correct them&s;elves. Yet be a&s;&s;ured, it it a delu&s;ion, and will not avail in our ju&s;tification before him.
<Q>who knoweth where|of we are made,</Q>
and of what we are capable. it is true, we are not all equally happy in our di&s;|po&s;itions: but human virtue con&s;i&s;ts in cheri&s;hing and cultivating every good inclination, and in check|ing and &s;ubduing every propen&s;ity to evil. If you had been born with a bad temper, it might have been made a good one, at lea&s;t with regard to its
<PB N="214" REF="024452_0210_0FC739F5C3901C00">
outward effects, by education, rea&s;on, and principle: and, though you are &s;o happy as to have a good one while young, do not &s;uppo&s;e it will always continue &s;o, if you neglect to maintain a proper command over it. Power, &s;ickne&s;s, di&s;appointments or world|ly cares, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay corrupt and embitter the fine&s;t di&s;po&s;i|tion, if they are not counteracted by rea&s;on and re|ligion.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, that every temper is inclined, in &s;ome degree, either to pa&s;&s;ion, peevi&s;hne&s;s, or ob|&s;tinacy. Many are &s;o unfortunate as to be inclined to each of the three in turn: it is nece&s;&s;ary, there|fore, to watch the bent of our nature, and to apply the remedies proper for the infirmity to which we are mo&s;t liable. With regard to the fir&s;t, it is &s;o injurious to &s;ociety, and &s;o odious in it&s;elf, e&s;peci|ally in the female character, that one would think &s;hame alone would be &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve a young woman from giving way to it; for it is as unbecom|ing her character to be betrayed into ill behaviour by <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> as by <HI>intoxication</HI>; and &s;he ought to be a|&s;hamed of the one, as much as of the other. Gentle|ne&s;s, meekne&s;s, and patience, are her peculiar di&s;|tinctions; and an enraged woman is one of the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting &s;ights in nature.</P>
<P>It is plain, from experience, that the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;i|onate people can command them&s;elves, when they have a motive &s;ufficiently &s;trong&mdash;&s;uch as the pre|&s;ence of tho&s;e they fear, or to whom they particu|larly de&s;ire to recommend them&s;elves: it is there|fore no excu&s;e to per&s;ons, whom you have injured by unkind reproaches, and unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ions, to tell them you were in a pa&s;&s;ion: the allowing your&s;elf to &s;peak to them in a pa&s;&s;ion, is a proof of an in&s;olent di&s;re|&s;pect, which the meane&s;t of your fellow-creatures would have a right to re&s;ent. When once you find your&s;elf heated &s;o far as to de&s;ire to &s;ay what you know would be provoking and wounding to another, you &s;hould immediately re&s;olve either to be &s;ilent, or to quit the room, rather than give utterance to any thing dictated by &s;o bad an inclination. Be a&s;&s;ured,
<PB N="215" REF="024452_0211_0FC739F73640E698">
you are then unfit to rea&s;on or to reprove, or to hear rea&s;on from others. It is therefore your part to re|tire from &s;uch an occa&s;ion of &s;in; and wait till you are cool, before you pre&s;ume to judge of what has pa&s;&s;ed. By accu&s;toming your&s;elf thus to conquer and di&s;appoint your anger, you will by degrees, find it grow weak and manageable, &s;o as to leave your rea|&s;on at liberty. You will be able to re&s;train your tongue from evil, and your looks and ge&s;tures from all expre&s;&s;ions of violence and ill-will. Pride, which produces &s;o many evils in the human mind, is the great &s;ource of pa&s;&s;ion. Whoever cultivates in him|&s;elf a proper humility, a due &s;en&s;e of his own faults and in&s;ufficiencies, and a due re&s;pect for others, will find but &s;mall temptation to violent or unrea&s;onable anger.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of real injuries, which ju&s;tify and call for re&s;entment, there is a noble and generous kind of anger, a proper and nece&s;&s;ary part of our nature, which has nothing in it &s;inful or degrading. I would not wi&s;h you in&s;en&s;ible to this; for the per&s;on, who feels not an injury, mu&s;t be incapable of being pro|perly affected by benefits. With tho&s;e, who treat you ill without provocation, you ought to maintain your own dignity. But, in order to do this, while you &s;how a &s;en&s;e of their improper behaviour, you mu&s;t pre&s;erve calmne&s;s and even good-breeding&mdash;and thereby convince them of the impotence, as well as inju&s;tice of their malice. You mu&s;t al&s;o weigh every circum&s;tance with candour and charity, and con&s;ider whether your &s;howing the re&s;entment de&s;erved, may not produce ill con&s;equences to innocent per&s;ons&mdash;as is almo&s;t always the ca&s;e in family quarrels&mdash;and whe|ther it may not occa&s;ion the breach of &s;ome duty, or nece&s;&s;ary connexion, to which you ought to &s;acrifice even your ju&s;t re&s;entments. Above all things, take care that a particular offence to you does not make you unju&s;t to the general character of the offend|ing per&s;on. Generous anger does not preclude e&s;|teem for what is really e&s;timable, nor does it de&s;troy good will to the per&s;on of its object: it even in&s;pires
<PB N="216" REF="024452_0212_0FC73A007153BF20">
the de&s;ire of overcoming him by benefits, and wi&s;hes to inflict no other puni&s;hment than the regret of hav|ing injured one, who de&s;erved his kindne&s;s: it is al|ways placable, and ready to be reconciled, as &s;oon as the offender is convinced of his error; nor can any &s;ub&s;equent injury provoke it to recur to pa&s;t di&s;|obligations, which had been once forgiven. But it is perhaps unnece&s;&s;ary to give rules for this ca&s;e.&mdash; The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of injured innocence naturally produces dignity, and u&s;ually prevents exce&s;s of an|ger. Our pa&s;&s;ion is mo&s;t unruly, when we are con|&s;cious of blame, and when we apprehend that we have laid our&s;elves open to contempt. Where we know we have been wrong, the lea&s;t inju&s;tice in the degree of blame imputed to us, excites our bittere&s;t re&s;entment; but, where we know our&s;elves fault|le&s;s, the &s;harpe&s;t accu&s;ation excites pity or contempt, rather than rage. Whenever therefore you feel your&s;elf very angry, &s;u&s;pect your&s;elf to be in the wrong, and re&s;olve to &s;tand the deci&s;ion of your own con&s;cience before you ca&s;t upon another the puni&s;h|ment, which is perhaps due to your&s;elf. This &s;elf-examination will at lea&s;t give you time to cool, and, if you are ju&s;t, will di&s;po&s;e you to balance your own wrong with that of your antagoni&s;t, and to &s;ettle the account with him on equal terms.</P>
<P>Peeve&s;hne&s;s, though not &s;o violent and fatal in its immediate effects, is &s;till more unamiable than pa&s;|&s;ion, and, if po&s;&s;ible, more de&s;tructive of happine&s;s, in as much as it operates more continually. Though the fretful man injures us le&s;s, he di&s;gu&s;ts us more than the pa&s;&s;ionate one&mdash; becau&s;e he betrays a low and little mind, intent on trifles, and engro&s;&s;ed by paltry &s;elf-love, which knows not how to bear the very ap|prehen&s;ion of any inconvenience. It is &s;elf-love then, which we mu&s;t combat, when we find our&s;elves a&s;&s;aulted by this infirmity; and by voluntarily endur|ing inconveniencies, we &s;hall habituate our&s;elves to bear them with ea&s;e, and good humour, when occa|&s;ioned by others. Perhaps this is the be&s;t kind of re|ligious mortification, as the chief end of denying our|&s;elves
<PB N="217" REF="024452_0213_0FC73A01C6A8E138">
any innocent indulgences mu&s;t be to acquire a habit of command over our pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations, particularly &s;uch as are likely to lead us into evil. Another method of conquering this enemy is to ab|&s;tract our minds from that attention to trifling cir|cum&s;tances, which u&s;ually creates this unea&s;ine&s;s. Tho&s;e who are engaged in high and important pur|&s;uits are very little affected by &s;mall inconveniences. The man who&s;e head is full of &s;tudious thought or who&s;e heart is full of care, will eat his dinner with|out knowing whether it was well or ill dre&s;&s;ed, or whether it was &s;erved punctually at the hour or not: and though ab&s;ence from the common things of life is far from de&s;irable&mdash;e&s;pecially in a woman&mdash;yet too minute and anxious an attention to them &s;eldom fails to produce a teazing, mean, and fretful di&s;po&s;ition. I would therefore wi&s;h your mind to have always &s;ome objects in pur&s;uit worthy of it; that it may not be engro&s;&s;ed by &s;uch as are in them&s;elves &s;carce worth a moment's anxiety. It is chiefly in the decline of life, when amu&s;ements fail, and when the more importu|nate pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ide, that this infirmity is ob&s;erved to grow upon us&mdash;and perhaps it will &s;eldom fail to do &s;o, unle&s;s carefully watched and counteracted by rea&s;on. We mu&s;t then endeavour to &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome pur&s;uits in the place of tho&s;e, which can only engage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in the beginning of our cour&s;e. The pur&s;uit of glory and happine&s;s in another life, by every means of improving and exalting our own minds, becomes more and more intere&s;ting to us, the nearer we draw to the end of all &s;ublunary enjoyments. Reading, reflexion, rational conver&s;ation, and, above all, con|ver&s;ing with God, by prayer and meditation, may pre&s;erve us from taking that anxious intere&s;t in the little comforts and conveniencies of our remaining days, which u&s;ually gives birth to &s;o much fretfulne&s;s in old people. But though the aged and infirm are mo&s;t liable to this evil&mdash;and they alone are to be pi|tied for it&mdash;yet we &s;ometimes &s;ee the young, the healthy, and tho&s;e who enjoy mo&s;t outward ble&s;&s;ings, inexcu&s;ably guilty of it. The &s;malle&s;t di&s;appointment

in plea&s;ure, or difficulty in the mo&s;t trifling employ|ment, will put wilful young people out of temper, and their very amu&s;ements frequently become &s;ources of vexation and peevi&s;hne&s;s. How often have I &s;een a girl, preparing for a ball, or for &s;ome other public appearance&mdash;unable to &s;atisfy her own vanity&mdash;fret over every ornament &s;he put on, quarrel with her maid, with her clothes, her hair; and growing &s;till more unlovely as &s;he grew more cro&s;s, be ready to fight with her looking-gla&s;s, for not making her as hand&s;ome as &s;he wi&s;hed to be! She did not con&s;ider that the traces of this ill-humour on her countenance would be a greater di&s;advantage to her appearance than any defect in her dre&s;s&mdash;or even than the plain|e&s;t features enlivened by joy and good-humour. There is a degree of re&s;ignation nece&s;&s;ary even to the enjoyment of plea&s;ure; we mu&s;t be ready and willing to give up &s;ome part of what we could wi&s;h for, be|fore we can enjoy that which is indulged to us. I have no doubt that &s;he, who frets all the while &s;he is dre&s;&s;ing for an a&s;&s;embly, will &s;uffer &s;till greater un|ea&s;ine&s;s when &s;he is there. The &s;ame craving, re&s;tle&s;s vanity will there endure a thou&s;and mortifications, which in the mid&s;t of &s;eeming plea&s;ure, will &s;ecretly corrode her heart; whil&s;t the meek and humble ge|nerally find more gratification than they expected, and return home plea&s;ed and enlivened from every &s;cene of amu&s;ement, though they could have &s;taid a|way from it with perfect ea&s;e and contentment.</P>
<P>Sullenne&s;s, or ob&s;tinacy, is perhaps a wor&s;e fault of temper than either of the former&mdash;and, if indulg|ed, may end in the mo&s;t fatal extremes of &s;tubborn melancholy, malice and revenge. The re&s;entment which, in&s;tead of being expre&s;&s;ed, is nur&s;ed in &s;ecret, and continually aggravated by the imagination, will, in time, become the ruling pa&s;&s;ion; and then, how horrible mu&s;t be his ca&s;e, who&s;e kind and plea&s;urable affections are all &s;wallowed up by the tormenting as well as dete&s;table &s;entiments of hatred and revenge? &mdash;

&mdash;Brood not over a re&s;entment which perhaps was at fir&s;t ill grounded, and which is undoubtedly heigh|tened by an heated imagination. But, when you have fir&s;t &s;ubdued your own temper, &s;o as to be able to &s;peak calmly, rea&s;onably, and kindly, then expo&s;tu|late with the per&s;on you &s;uppo&s;e to be in fault&mdash;hear what &s;he has to &s;ay; and either reconcile your&s;elf to her, or quiet your mind under the injury, by the prin|ciple of chri&s;tian charity. But if it &s;hould appear that you your&s;elf have been mo&s;t to blame, or if you have been in an error, acknowledge it fairly and hand&s;ome|ly: if you feel any reluctance to do &s;o, be certain that it ari&s;es from pride, to conquer which is an ab&s;olute duty&mdash;"A &s;oft an&s;wer turneth away wrath:" and a ge|nerous confe&s;&s;ion oftentimes more than atones for the fault which requires it. Truth and ju&s;tice demand that we &s;hould acknowledge conviction, as &s;oon as we feel it, and not maintain an erroneous opinion, or ju&s;tify a wrong conduct, merely for the fal&s;e &s;hame of confe&s;&s;ing our pa&s;t ignorance. A fal&s;e &s;hame it undoubtedly is, and as impolitic as unju&s;t; &s;ince your error is already &s;een by tho&s;e who endeavour to &s;et you right: but your conviction, and the candour and genero&s;ity of owning it freely, may &s;till be an honour to you, and would greatly recommend you to the per&s;on with whom you di&s;puted. With a di&s;po&s;ition &s;trongly inclined to &s;ullenne&s;s or ob&s;tinacy, this mu&s;t be a very painful exertion; and to make a perfect conque&s;t over your&s;elf may at once perhaps appear impracticable, while the zeal of &s;elf ju&s;tification, and the abhorrence of blame, are &s;trong upon you. But, if you are &s;o unhappy as to yield to your in|firmity, at one time, do not let this di&s;courage you from renewing your efforts. Your mind will gain &s;trength from the conte&s;t; and your internal enemy will by degrees be forced to give ground. Be not afraid to revive the &s;ubject, as &s;oon as you find your&s;elf able to &s;ubdue your temper; and then frank|ly

lay open the conflict you &s;u&s;tained at the time; by this you will make all the amends in your power for your fault, and will certainly change the di&s;gu&s;t you have given into pity at lea&s;t, if not admiration. Nothing is more endearing than &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion:&mdash; and you will find &s;uch a &s;atisfaction in your own con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and in the renewed tenderne&s;s and e&s;teem you will gain from the per&s;on concerned, that your ta&s;k for the future will be made more ea&s;y, and your reluctance to be convinced, will on every occa&s;ion grow le&s;s and le&s;s.</P>
<P>The love of truth, and a real de&s;ire of improve|ment, ought to be the only motives of argumenta|tion: and, where the&s;e are &s;incere, no difficulty can be made of embracing the truth, as &s;oon as it is perceived. But, in fact, people oftener di&s;pute from vanity and pride, which make it a grievous mort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fication to allow that we are the wi&s;er for what we have heard from another. To receive advice, reproof, and in&s;truction, properly, is the &s;ure&s;t &s;ign of a &s;incere and humble heart&mdash;and &s;hows a great|ne&s;s of mind, which commands our re&s;pect and re|verence, while it appears &s;o willingly to yield to us the &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, notwith&s;tanding, that I do not wi&s;h you to hear of your faults without pain: &s;uch an indifference would afford &s;mall hopes of amendment. Shame and remor&s;e are the fir&s;t &s;teps to true repentance; yet we &s;hould be willing to bear this pain, and thankful to the kind hand that inflicts it for our good. Nor mu&s;t we, by &s;ullen &s;ilence under it, leave our kind phy&s;ician in doubt, whether the operation has taken effect or not, or whether it has not added another malady, in&s;tead of curing the fir&s;t. You mu&s;t con&s;ider, that tho&s;e who tell you of your faults, if they do it from motives of kindne&s;s and not of malice, exert their friend&s;hip in a painful office, which mu&s;t have co&s;t them as great an effort as it can be to you to acknowledge the &s;ervice; and, if you refu&s;e this en|couragement, you cannot expect that any one, who is not ab&s;olutely obliged to it by duty, will a &s;econd

<P>I know not, whether that &s;trange caprice, that in|equality of ta&s;te and behaviour, &s;o commonly attri|buted to our &s;ex, may be properly called a fault of temper&mdash;as it &s;eems not to be connected with, or ari&s;ing from our animal frame, but to be rather the fruit of our own &s;elf-indulgence, degenerating by de|grees into &s;uch a wantonne&s;s of will as knows not how to plea&s;e it&s;elf. When, in&s;tead of regulating our actions by rea&s;on and principle, we &s;uffer our|&s;elves to be guided by every &s;light and momentary impul&s;e of inclination, we &s;hall, doubtle&s;s, appear &s;o variable and incon&s;tant, that nobody can gue&s;s, by our behaviour to-day, what may be expected from us to-morrow; nor can we our&s;elves tell whether what we delighted in a week ago, will now afford us the lea&s;t degree of plea&s;ure. It is in vain for others to attempt to plea&s;e us&mdash;we cannot plea&s;e our&s;elves, though all we could wi&s;h for waits our choice: and thus does a capricious woman become
<Q>&s;ick of her|&s;elf, through very &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s:</Q>
And, when this is the ca&s;e, it is ea&s;y to judge how &s;ick others mu&s;t be of her, and how contemptible and di&s;gu&s;ting &s;he mu&s;t appear. This wretched &s;tate is the u&s;ual con&s;equence of power and flattery. May my dear child never meet with the temptation of that exce&s;&s;ive and ill-judged indulgence from a hu&s;band, which &s;he has happily e&s;caped from her parents, and which &s;eldom fails to reduce women to the mi&s;erable condition of a hu|moured child, always unhappy from having nobody's will to &s;tudy but its own!

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE hurry and impertinence of receiving and paying vi&s;its on account of your marriage, being now over, you are beginning to enter into a cour&s;e of life, where you will want much advice to divert you from falling into many errors, fopperies, and follies, to which your &s;ex is &s;ubject. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e always borne an entire friend&s;hip to your fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and mo|ther: and the per&s;on they have cho&s;en for your hu&s;|band, hath been, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, my particular favourite. I have long wi&s;hed you might come to|gether; becau&s;e I hoped, that from the goodne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our di&s;po&s;ition, and by following the coun&s;el of wi&s;e friends, you might, in time, make your&s;elf worthy of him. Your parents were &s;o far in the right, that they did not produce you much into the world, whereby you avoided many wrong &s;teps which others have taken, and have fewer ill impre&s;&s;ions to be removed. But they failed, as it is generally the ca&s;e, in too much neglecting to cultivate your mind; without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to acquire or pre&s;erve the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem of a wi&s;e man, who &s;oon grows weary of acting the lover, and treating his wife like a mi&s;tre&s;s, but wants a rea&s;onable compa|nion,
<PB N="226" REF="024452_0222_0FC73A1BF3E4C658">
and a true friend, through every &s;tage of his life. It mu&s;t be therefore your bu&s;ine&s;s to qualify your&s;elf for tho&s;e offices; wherein I will not fail to be your director, as long as I &s;hall think you de&s;erve it, by letting you know how you are to act, and what you are to avoid.</P>
<P>And beware of de&s;pi&s;ing or neglecting my in&s;truc|tions, whereon will depend not only your making a good figure in the world, but your own real happi|ne&s;s, as well as that of the per&s;on who ought to be the deare&s;t to you.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore de&s;ire you, in the fir&s;t place, to be very &s;low in changing the <HI>mode&s;t behaviour</HI> of a <HI>virgin:</HI> It is u&s;ual in young wives, before they have been many weeks married, to a&s;&s;ume a bold, forward look and manner of talking, as if they intended to &s;ignify in all companies, that they were no longer girls, and con&s;equently that their whole demeanor, before they got a hu&s;band, was all but a countenance and con&s;traint upon their nature; whereas, I &s;up|po&s;e, if the votes of wi&s;e men were gathered, a very great majority would be in favour of tho&s;e ladies, who, after they were entered into that &s;tate, rather cho&s;e to double their portion of mode&s;ty and re&s;erv|edne&s;s.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t likewi&s;e warn you &s;trictly again&s;t the lea&s;t degree of <HI>fondne&s;s</HI> to your hu&s;band, before any wit|ne&s;s what&s;oever, even before your neare&s;t relations, or the very maids of your chamber. This proceed|ing is &s;o exceedingly odious and di&s;gu&s;tful to all who have either good breeding or good &s;en&s;e, that they a&s;&s;ign two very unamiable rea&s;ons for it: the one is gro&s;s hypocri&s;y; and the other has too bad a name to mention. If there is any difference to be made, your hu&s;band is the lowe&s;t per&s;on in company, either at home or abroad; and every gentleman pre&s;ent has a better claim to all marks of civility and di&s;tinc|tion from you. Conceal your e&s;teem and love in your own brea&s;t, and re&s;erve your kind looks and language for private hours, which are &s;o many in the four and twenty, that they will afford time to

employ a pa&s;&s;ion as exalted as any that was ever de&s;cribed in a <HI>French</HI> romance.</P>
<P>Upon this head, I &s;hould likewi&s;e advi&s;e you to differ in practice from tho&s;e ladies who affect abun|dance of <HI>unea&s;ine&s;s</HI> while their hu&s;bands are abroad&mdash; &s;tart with every knock at the door&mdash;and ring the bell ince&s;&s;antly for the &s;ervants to let in their ma&s;ter; will not eat a bit at dinner or &s;upper, if the hu&s;band happens to &s;tay out; and receive him at his return, with &s;uch a medley of chiding and kindne&s;s, and ca|techi&s;ing him where he has been, that a &s;hrew from <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> would be a more ea&s;y and eligible com|panion.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame leaven are tho&s;e wives, who, when their hu&s;bands are gone a journey, mu&s;t have a let|ter every po&s;t, upon pain of fits and hy&s;terics; and a day mu&s;t be fixed for their return home, without the lea&s;t allowance for bu&s;ine&s;s, or &s;ickne&s;s, or acci|dents, or weather: upon which, I can only &s;ay, that in my ob&s;ervation, tho&s;e ladies who are apt to make the greate&s;t clutter on &s;uch occa&s;ions, would liberally have paid a me&s;&s;enger for bringing them news, that their hu&s;bands had broken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cks on the road.</P>
<P>You will perhaps be offended, when I advi&s;e you to abate a little of that violent pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>fine clothes,</HI> &s;o predominant in your &s;ex. It is a little hard, that ours, for who&s;e &s;ake you wear them, are not ad|mitted to be of your council. I may venture to a&s;|&s;ure you, that we will make an abatement at any time of four pounds a yard in a brocade, if the la|dies will but allow a &s;uitable addition of care in the <HI>cleanline&s;s</HI> and &s;weetne&s;s of their per&s;ons. For the &s;atirical part of mankind will needs believe, that it is not impo&s;&s;ible to be very fine and very filthy; and that the capacities of a lady are &s;ometimes apt to fall &s;hort in cultivating cleanline&s;s and finery together. I &s;hall only add, upon &s;o tender a &s;ubject, what a plea&s;ant gentleman &s;aid concerning a &s;illy woman of quality; that nothing could make her &s;upportable but cutting off her head; for his ears were offended by her tongue, and his no&s;e by her hair and teeth.</P>

Whereas I am afraid it will be hard for you to pick out one female ac|quaintance in this town, from whom you will not be in manife&s;t danger of contracting &s;ome foppery, affectation, vanity, folly, or vice. Your only &s;afe way of conver&s;ing with them is, by a firm re&s;olution to proceed, in your practice and behaviour, directly contrary to whatever they &s;hall &s;ay and do: and this I take to be a good general rule, with very few ex|ceptions.

In the&s;e, and a thou&s;and other ca&s;es, it will be prudent to retain as many of their lectures in your memory as you can, and then determine to act in full oppo&s;ition to them all.</P>

<P>I advi&s;e that your company at home &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of men, rather than women. To &s;ay the truth, I never yet knew a tolerable woman to be fond of her own &s;ex. I confe&s;s, when both are mixed and well

But a knot of ladies got together by them&s;elves, is a very &s;chool of impertinence and detraction, and it is well if tho&s;e be the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>Let your men-acquaintance be of your hu&s;band's choice, and not recommended to you by any &s;he-com|panions; becau&s;e they will certainly fix a coxcomb upon you; and it will co&s;t you &s;ome time and pains before you can arrive at the knowledge of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing &s;uch a one from a man of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Never take a <HI>favourite waiting-maid</HI> into your ca|binet-council, to entertain you with hi&s;tories of tho&s;e ladies whom &s;he hath formerly &s;erved, of their di|ver&s;ions and their dre&s;&s;es; to in&s;inuate how great a fortune you brought, and how little you are allowed to &s;quander; to appeal to her from your hu&s;band, and to be determined by her judgment, becau&s;e you are &s;ure it will be always for you; to receive and di&s;card &s;ervants by her approbation or di&s;like; to engage you, by her in&s;inuations, into mi&s;under&s;tand|ings with your be&s;t friends; to repre&s;ent all things in fal&s;e colours, and to be the common emi&s;&s;ary of &s;candal.</P>
<P>But the grand affair of your life will be to gain and pre&s;erve the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem of your <HI>hu&s;band.</HI> You are married to a man of good education and learning, of an excellent under&s;tanding, and an exact ta&s;te. It is true, and it is happy for you, that the&s;e qualities in him are adorned with great mode&s;ty, a mo&s;t amiable &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and an unu&s;ual di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;obriety and virtue. But neither good-nature nor virtue will &s;uffer him to e&s;teem you again&s;t his judgment; and though he is not capable of u&s;ing you ill, yet you will in time grow a thing indiffe|rent and perhaps contemptible, unle&s;s you can &s;up|ply the lo&s;s of youth and beauty with more durable qualities. You have a very few years to be young and hand&s;ome in the eyes of the world; and as few
<PB N="230" REF="024452_0226_0FC73A2A8AF30638">
months to be &s;o in the eyes of a hu&s;band, who is not a fool; for I hope you do not &s;till dream of charms and raptures, which marriage ever did, and ever will, put a &s;udden end to. Be&s;ides your's was a match of prudence and common good-liking, without any mixture of that ridiculous pa&s;&s;ion, which has no be|ing but in play-books and romances.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t therefore u&s;e all endeavours to attain to &s;ome degree of tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which your hu&s;band mo&s;t values in other people, and for which he is mo&s;t valued him&s;elf. You mu&s;t improve your mind, by clo&s;ely pur&s;uing &s;uch a method of &s;tudy as I &s;hall direct or approve of. You mu&s;t get a collection of hi&s;tory and travels, which I will recommend to you, and &s;pend &s;ome hours every day in reading them, and making extracts from them, if your me|mory be weak. You mu&s;t invite per&s;ons of know|ledge and under&s;tanding to an acquaintance with you, by who&s;e conver&s;ation you may learn to correct your ta&s;te and judgment; and when you can bring your&s;elf to comprehend and reli&s;h the good &s;en&s;e of others, you will arrive in time to think rightly your|&s;elf, and to become a rea&s;onable and agreeable com|panion. This mu&s;t produce in your hu&s;band a true rational love and e&s;teem for you, which old age will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot dimini&s;h. He will have regard for your judg|ment and opinion in matters of the greate&s;t weight; you will be able to entertain each other without a third per&s;on to relieve you by finding di&s;cour&s;e. The endowments of your mind will even make your per|&s;on more greeable to him: and when you are alone, your time will not lie heavy upon your hands, for want of &s;ome trifling amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>As little re&s;pect as I have for the generality of your &s;ex, it hath &s;ometimes moved me with pity, to &s;ee the lady of the hou&s;e forced to withdraw imme|diately after dinner, and this in families where there is not much drinking; as if it were an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, that women are incapable of all conver|&s;ation. In a room where both &s;exes meet, if the men are di&s;cour&s;ing upon any general &s;ubject, the
<PB N="231" REF="024452_0227_0FC73A2DB91985F0">
ladies never think it their bu&s;ine&s;s to partake in what pa&s;&s;es, but in a &s;eparate club entertain each other with the price and choice of lace, and &s;ilk, and what dre&s;&s;es they liked or di&s;approved at the church or the play-hou&s;e. And when you are among your&s;elves, how naturally, after the fir&s;t compliments, do you apply your hands to each other's lappets and ruffles, and mantua's, as if the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of your lives, and the public concern of the world depended upon the cut or colour of your dre&s;&s;es. As divines &s;ay, that &s;ome people take more pains to be damned, than it would co&s;t them to be &s;aved; &s;o your &s;ex employs more thought, memory and application, to be fools, than would &s;erve to make them wi&s;e and u&s;eful. When I reflect on this, I cannot conceive you to be human creatures, but a &s;ort of &s;pecies hardly a de|gree above a monkey; which has more diverting tricks than any of you; is an animal le&s;s mi&s;chievous and expen&s;ive; might in time be a tolerable critic in velvet and brocade; and, for aught I know, would equally become them.</P>
<P>I would have you look upon finery as a nece&s;&s;a|ry folly, as all great ladies did, whom I have ever known: I do not de&s;ire you to be out of the fa&s;hion, but to be the la&s;t and lea&s;t in it. I expect that your dre&s;s &s;hall be one degree lower than your fortune can afford; and in your own heart I would wi&s;h you to be an utter contemner of all di&s;tinctions which a finer petticoat can give you; becau&s;e it will neither make you richer, hand&s;omer, younger, better natured, more virtuous, or wi&s;e, than if it hung upon a peg.</P>
<P>If you are in company with men of learning, though they happen to di&s;cour&s;e of arts and &s;ciences out of your compa&s;s, yet you will gather more advantage by li&s;tening to them, than from all the non&s;en&s;e and frippery of your own &s;ex; but if they be men of breeding as well as learning, they will &s;eldom e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|gage in any conver&s;ation where you ought not to be a hearer, and in time have your part. If they talk of the manners and cu&s;toms of the &s;everal kingdoms of Europe, of travels into remoter nations, of the &s;tate
<PB N="232" REF="024452_0228_0FC73A2EC447EAB0">
of their own country, or of the great men and acti|ons of Greece and Rome; if they give their judgment upon Engli&s;h and French writers, either in ver&s;e or pro&s;e, or of the nature and limits of virtue and vice, it is a &s;hame for an Engli&s;h lady not to reli&s;h &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es, not to improve by them, and endea|vour, by reading and information, to have her &s;hare in tho&s;e entertainments, rather than turn a&s;ide, as it is the u&s;ual cu&s;tom, and con&s;ult with the woman who &s;its next her, about a new cargo of fans.</P>
<P>It is a little hard, that not one gentleman's daugh|ter in a thou&s;and &s;hould be brought to read or under|&s;tand her own natural tongue, or to be a judge of the ea&s;ie&s;t books that are written in it; as any one may find, who can have the patience to hear them, when they are di&s;po&s;ed to mangle a play or a novel, where the lea&s;t word out of the common road is &s;ure to di&s;|concert them. It is no wonder, when they are not &s;o much as taught to &s;pell in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hildhood, nor can ever attain to it in their whole lives. I advi&s;e you therefore to read aloud, more or le&s;s, every day to your hu&s;band, if he will permit you, or to any other friend, (but not a female one) who is able to &s;et you right; and as for &s;pelling, you may compa&s;s it in time, by making collections from the books you read.</P>
<P>I know very well that tho&s;e, who are commonly called learned women, have lo&s;t all manner of credit by their impertinent talkativene&s;s and conceit of them&s;elves: but there is an ea&s;y remedy for this, if you once con&s;ider, that after all the pains you may be at, you never can arrive, in point of learning, to the perfection of a &s;chool-boy. The reading I would advi&s;e you to, is only for improvement of your own good &s;en&s;e, which will never fail of being mended by di&s;cretion. It is a wrong method, and ill choice of books, that makes tho&s;e learned ladies ju&s;t &s;o much wor&s;e for what they have read. And therefore it &s;hall be my care to direct you better, a ta&s;k for which I take my&s;elf to be not ill-qualified; becau&s;e I have &s;pent more time, and have had more opportunities than many others, to ob&s;erve and di&s;cover from what ources the various follies of women are derived.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="024452_0229_0FC73A3053589B30">Pray ob&s;erve how in&s;ignificant things are the com|mon race of ladies, when they have pa&s;&s;ed their youth and beauty; how contemptible they appear to the men, and yet more contemptible to the younger part of their own &s;ex; and have no relief but in pa&s;&s;ing their afternoons in vi&s;its, where they are never accepta|ble; and their evenings at cards among each other; while the former part of the day is &s;pent in &s;pleen and envy, or in vain endeavours to repair, by art and dre&s;s, the ruins of time. Whereas I have known la|dies at &s;ixty, to whom all the polite part of the court and town paid their addre&s;&s;es, without any farther view than that of enjoying the plea&s;ure of their con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I am ignorant of any one quality that is amiable in a man, which is not equally &s;o in a woman: I do not except even mode&s;ty and gentlene&s;s of nature. Nor do I know one vice or folly which is not equally dete&s;table in both. There is, indeed, one infirmity which &s;eems to be generally allowed you, I mean that of <HI>cowardice:</HI> yet there &s;hould &s;eem to be &s;omething very capricious, that when women profe&s;s their ad|miration for a colonel or a captain on account of his valour, they &s;hould fancy it a very graceful, becoming quality in them&s;elves to be afraid of their own &s;ha|dows, to &s;cream in a barge when the weather is calme&s;t, or in a coach at the ring; to run from a cow at a hundred yards di&s;tance; to fall into fits at the &s;ight of a &s;pider, an earwig, or a frog. At lea&s;t, if cow|ardice be a &s;ign of cruelty, (as it is generally grant|ed) I can hardly think it an accompli&s;hment &s;o de&s;ira|ble as to be thought worth improving by affectation.</P>
<P>And as the &s;ame virtues equally become both &s;exes, &s;o there is no quality whereby women endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from men, for which they are not ju&s;t &s;o much the wor&s;e, except that only of re|&s;ervedne&s;s; which, however, as you generally ma|nage it, is nothing el&s;e but affectation or hypocri&s;y. For as you cannot too much di&s;countenance tho&s;e of our &s;ex, who pre&s;ume to take unbecoming liber|ties before you; &s;o you ought to be wholly uncon|&s;trained

in the company of de&s;erving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en, when you have had &s;ufficient experience of their di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>There is never wanting in this town, a tribe of bold, &s;waggering, rattling ladies, who&s;e talents pa&s;s among coxcombs for wit and humour; their excellen|cy lies in rude, &s;hocking expre&s;&s;ions, and what they call <HI>running a man down.</HI> If a gentleman in their company happens to have any blemi&s;h in his birth or per&s;on, if any misfortune hath befallen his family or him&s;elf, for which he is a&s;hamed, they will be &s;ure to give him broad hints of it without any provoca|tion. I would recommend you to the acquaintance of a common pro&s;titute, rather than to that of &s;uch termagants as the&s;e. I have often thought that no man is obliged to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch creatures to be women; but to treat them like in&s;olent ra&s;cals di&s;gui&s;ed in female habits, who ought to be &s;tript and kicked down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I will add one thing, although it be a little out of place, which is to de&s;ire, that you will learn to value and e&s;teem your hu&s;band for tho&s;e good qualities which he really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth, and not to fancy others in him which he certainly hath not. For although this latter is generally under&s;tood to be a mark of love, yet it is indeed nothing but affectation or ill judg|ment. It is true, he wants &s;o very few accompli&s;h|ments, that you are in no great danger of erring on this &s;ide; but my caution is occa&s;ioned by a lady of your acquaintance, married to a very valuable per|&s;on, whom yet &s;he is &s;o unfortunate as to be always commending for tho&s;e perfections to which he can lea&s;t pretend.</P>
<P>I can give you no advice upon the article of <HI>expen&s;e,</HI> only I think you ought to be well informed how much your hu&s;band's revenue amounts to, and be &s;o good a computer as to keep within it, in that part of the management which falls to your &s;hare; and not to put your&s;elf in the number of tho&s;e politic ladies, who think they gain a great point, when they have teized their hu&s;bands to buy them a new equipage, a laced head, or a fine petticoat, without once con&s;i|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ering
